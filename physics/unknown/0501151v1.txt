Abstract    The  distribution  of  energy  loss  due  to  viscosity  friction  in  plane  Couette  flow  and 
Taylor-Couette Flow between concentric rotating cylinders are studied in detail for various flow 
conditions.  The energy loss is related to the industrial processes in some fluid delivery devices 
and  has  significant  influence  on  the  flow  efficiency,  flow  stability,  turbulent transition,  mixing, 
and  heat  transfer  behaviours,  etc.  Therefore,  it  is  very  helpful  to  know  about  the  energy  loss 
distribution in the flow domain and to know its influence on the flow for understanding the flow 
physics.  The  calculation  method  of  the  energy  loss  distribution  in  the  Taylor-Couette  Flow 
between  concentric  rotating  cylinders  has  not  been  found  in  open  literature.  In  this  note,  the 
principle and the calculation are given for single cylinder rotating of inner or outer cylinder, and 
counter and same direction rotating of two cylinders. For comparison, the distribution of energy 
loss in a plane Couette flow is also derived for various flow conditions. Discussions of the effect 
of energy loss on the flow behaviour are carried out from which some findings are suggested.

1. Introduction 
 
The  flow  device  of  Taylor-Couette  Flow  comprising  concentric  rotating  cylinders  is 
widely used in many industrial and research processes found in chemical, mechanical and nuclear 
engineering. The device can be only one cylinder rotating and the other at rest, or two cylinders 
rotating  in  the  same  or  counter  directions.  The  accurate  calculation  of  the  flow  property  is 
important  even  from  the  standpoint  of  the  normal  operation  of  the  device.  The  distribution  of 
energy loss in the device may greatly influence the industrial process of mixing, diffusion, heat 
transfer, and flow stabilities, etc. Despite the importance, it is interesting to note that the method 
for calculating or the actual calculation of the distribution of energy loss in such a device has not 
been found in the open literature. In particular, for the case of two cylinders rotating in the same 
direction, the calculation of energy loss distribution may pose some difficulties. In this note, the 
principle and the detailed derivation for the calculation are given. 
As in many engineering problems, knowing about the loss distribution in the flow is very 
 
useful  for  enhancing  the performance  of  the  device  and increasing  the  efficiency.  For  example, 
the  design  of  an  airfoil  can  be  done  according  to  the  prescribed  loss  distribution  or  pressure 
distribution in order to increase the lift without compromising on the safety aspects. In the design 
of  axial  compressors,  the  deflection  angle  of  the  air  flow  passing  a  blade  can  be  varied  along 
spanwise direction in terms of the distribution of energy loss (along the height of the blade). In 
the  design  of  centrifugal  compressors,  the  distribution  of  energy  losses  is  also  used  in  the 
aerodynamic  calculation  and  design  of  the  three-dimensional  impeller  and  the  distorted  vane 
diffusers for the purposes of enhancing the efficiency and of broadening the operation range [1-
2]. Energy loss due to viscosity in the flow can reduces the efficiency of the fluid transportation. 
On the other hand, it may enhance the flow stability in some cases.  
 
In the past years, the problem of flow between two concentric rotating cylinders has been 
extensively  studied  in  terms  of  the  flow  stability  due  to  infinitesimal  disturbances  [3-5].  This 
problem  was  first  investigated  experimentally  by  Couette  (1890)  and  Mallock  (1896).  It  was 
observed  that  the  torque  needed  to  rotate  the  outer  cylinder  increased  linearly  with  the  rotation 
speed  until  a  critical  rotation  speed,  after  which  the  torque  increased  much  more  rapidly.  This 
change was due to a transition from stable to unstable flow at the critical rotation speed. For the 
stability  of  an  inviscid  fluid  moving  in  concentric  layers,  Lord  Rayleigh  (1916)  [6]  used  the 
circulation  variation  versus  the  radius  to  explain  the  instability  and  von  Karman  (1934)  [7] 
employed the relative roles of centrifugal force and pressure gradient to interpret the instability 
initiation. Their goal was to determine  the condition for which a perturbation resulting from an 
adverse gradient of angular momentum can lead to instability. In a classic paper, Taylor (1923) 
[8]  presented  a  mathematical  stability  analysis  for  viscous  flow  and  compared  the  results  to 
laboratory  observations.  Taylor 
to 
mathematical  calculation  for  the  instability  initiation.  Taylor  observed  that,  for  a  gap  between 
cylinders much smaller than the radii and under a given rotating speed of the outer cylinder, as 
the rotating speed of the inner cylinder exceeds a certain critical value, rows of cellular pattern is 
developed. These works have been considered as classical physics [9-12]. In Taylor’s findings, it 
is shown that the increase of fluid viscosity can delay the instability.   
 
Plane  Couette  flow  is  the  limiting  status  of  Taylor-Couette  flow  when  the  radii  of  the 
cylinders tend to towards infinite dimension. The former is linearly stable via eigenvalue analysis 
for all the Reynolds number, while the latter displays a critical value of the Taylor number from 
the classical linear stability analysis performed by Taylor (1923). How the linear instability that 
leads  to  the  formation  of  Taylor  vortices  is  lost  in  the  case  of  the  plane  Couette  flow  is  not 
known.  Some  authors  try  to  associate  or  link  these  two  flows  using  numerical  simulation  and 
experiments [13,14].  Recent studies show that the instability in shear flows is dominated by the 
energy  gradient  in  transverse  direction  and  the  energy  loss  in  the  streamwise  direction  for  wall 
bounded parallel flows. The energy loss of unit volume fluid along the streamwise direction for 

the  experiment  observation  and 

interpreted 

linked

pressure  driven  flows  equals  to  the  energy  gradient  of  unit  volume  fluid  along  the  streamline 
direction [15,16].   
 
Generally,  the  energy  loss  due  to  viscosity  in  shear  flows  is  helpful  to  delay  the  flow 
instability subjected to a perturbation such as found in Taylor-Couette flows and demonstrated by 
Taylor [8]. However, in the linear stability theory such as [8,3,4], it is not shown where the flow 
instability is first started. Since the flow instability in shear flows is a local phenomenon and is 
intermittent in the beginning stage, it is interesting to find the position to first stimulate the flow 
instability. It is noticed that the analysis of energy loss in shear flows may provide some useful 
information for studying the flow instability. In pressure driven flows, the component of Laplace 
term in Navier-Stokes equation in streamwise direction represents this energy loss along the flow 
path.  For  plane  Poiseuille  flow,  this  energy  loss  is  constant  along  the  transverse  direction.  For 
shear driven flows, this energy loss along the streamline is not explicitly shown in Navier-Stokes 
equations.  In  this  paper,  motivated  from  these  ideas,  distributions  of  the  energy  loss  of  unit 
volume  fluid  along  the  streamline  in  the  Taylor-Couette  flows  between  concentric  rotating 
cylinders are analyzed in detail for single cylinder rotating of inner or outer cylinder, and counter 
and  same  direction  rotating  of  two  cylinders.  In  order  to  present  a  link  and  comparison  to  the 
plane Couette flow, the energy loss for plane Couette flow along the streamline is first derived for 
various  flow  conditions.  The  analytical  results  obtained  can  be  helpful  for  understanding  some 
complex phenomena occurring in the flow.  
2. Energy Loss Distribution for Plane Couette Flow

the  fluid  energy 

E

=

p

 in  unit  volume  for  incompressible  fluid  is  constant  along  the 

streamwise direction.  This is not to say that there is no energy loss due to viscous friction in the 
flow.  The  friction  loss  must  still  occur  since  this  is  a  viscous  fluid  (The  zero  energy  loss  only 
occurs for inviscid flow). The energy level is kept constant because the energy loss due to friction 
is exactly compensated by the energy input to the flow by the moving wall.  The work done to the 
flow by the moving wall is balanced by the energy loss in the flow.   
       The  velocity  distribution  for  plane  Couette  flow  can  be  obtained  for  solving  the  Navier-

Stokes  equation,  as  in  [17].      Because  of 

0=v

Since the shear stress is uniform in the domain (Eq.(4)), the term in above equation is uniform in 
the domain too for a fluid element. It is noticed that this term for a fluid element is also a Galilean 
Invariant  because 
 is  Galilean  Invariant.  However,  the  fluid  element  near  the  upper  plate 
has  higher  velocity  and  the  fluid  element  near  the  bottom  plate  has  lower  velocity.  Thus,  the 
energy loss of fluid element in unit volume fluid may vary across the transeverse direction. The 
fluid volume passing through dy depth in dt time is 
dtuz
         
Hence,  the  energy  consumed  by  the  fluid  element  in  unit  volume  in  the  length  of  x∆  in

The  energy  loss  per  unit  volumetric  fluid  in  unit  length  along  the  streamwise  direction  is 
given as 

As the fluid element can be made infinitesimally small in a continuous sense, the rate of energy

It should be emphasized that this rate of energy loss per unit volumetric fluid in unit length along 
the  streamwise  direction  is  not  a  Galilean  Invariant.  It  is  calculated  along  the  flow  path  in  unit 
length and is independent of time. It is distinguished from the usual energy dissipation rate of unit 
volumetric  fluid  which  is  independent  of  the  flow  path  and  flow  distance  and  is  a  Galilean 
invariant. For a plane Couette flow, the latter can be expressed as 

τφ=

du

. 

Strictly, this term can be also obtained by dividing the energy consumed of a fixed fluid element 
 for plane Couette flow, 
in unit time with the fixed volume of the fluid element

As is commonly known, the energy dissipation rate per unit volumetric fluid in unit time (φ) is a 
Galilean invariant.  Its relationship to Eq.(6) is given below. The energy dissipation rate per unit 
volumetric  fluid  in  dt  time  is φdt.    This  fixed  fluid  element  in  dt  time  is  translated  a  distance

. Therefore, the energy dissipation of the fluid element in unit length is just the energy loss

For  a  given  position  in  y  direction  (Fig.1a),  the  energy  loss  per  unit  volumetric  fluid 

Therefore,  for  the  pressure  driven  flows  like  a  Poiseuille  flow,  the  rate  of  energy  loss  per  unit 
volumetric fluid along the streamline as given by Eq.(7) is indeed a Galilean Invariant. There are 
many fundamental differences between the pressure driven and shear driven flows.

It  can  be  seen  from  Eq.(8)  that  the  magnitude  of  energy  loss  in  unit  volume  is 
2h . This equation is plotted in Fig.3 (also see 
proportional to U and is inversely proportional to 
Fig.1a for the flow geometry). It can also be seen that at the bottom wall, the energy loss of unit 
volume  fluid  is  infinite  for  y=0.  At  the  upper  wall,  the  consumed  energy  of  unit  volume  fluid 
along the streamwise direction is (y=h),

It  can  be  observed  from  Fig.3  that  the  energy  loss  of  unit  volume  fluid  increases  with 
decreasing y along the width of the channel and tends towards infinity on approaching the bottom 
wall.  Because  the  energy  loss  has  a  damping  role  to  any  flow  disturbance,  the  flow  near  the 
bottom wall is therefore strongly stable. Towards the top plate, the energy loss is lowest and the 
flow is therefore most possibly unstable.  
 
In  the  plane  Poiseuille  flow,  the  energy  loss  of  unit  volume  fluid  is  constant  along  the 
width of the channel; see Eq.(7). Thus, the damping role due to energy loss to the disturbance is 
the same along the channel width. This is one of the main differences between the plane Couette 
flow and the plane Poiseuille flow. This difference in behaviour or characteristic may play a role 
in the process leading to instability of the flow.

It can be seen from Eq.(13) that the magnitude of energy loss is proportional to (

) and is 
22h .  The  distribution  of  energy  loss  is  shown  in  Figs.4  and  5  for 
inversely  proportional  to 
2U . The energy loss increases with the decreasing magnitude 
1U  and  
different combinations of 
of y along the width of the channel, and it tends to be infinite at the centreline. Thus, the flow at 
the  centreline  is  strongly  stable.    Therefore,  the  turbulence  initiation  would  be  very  unlikely  to 
originate from the centreline locality; any small disturbance can be easily damped out due to the 
associated  large  energy  loss.  On  comparing  Fig.4  to  Fig.5,  it  is  found  that  by  changing  the 
magnitudes  of  velocities  of  the  two  plates,  this  highest  energy  loss  position  can  be  moved 
between the two plates. This phenomenon or observation can be very useful for some industrial 
purposes. The fluid particles near the walls always have the smallest energy loss. These locations 
are  likely  places  where  instability  can  occur  first.    Bottin  et  al’s  experiments  have  actually 
indicated that the instability of the flow first started at the moving wall [18].  
 
From the results of the two cases above, it can be suggested that for plane Couette flow 
the position of extreme energy loss tending towards infinite is located at the point of zero velocity. 
However, it is not applicable for two plates moving in the same direction. 
 
2.3 Two plates moving in the same direction 
 
When  the  two  plates  are  moving  in  the  same  direction  (Fig.1c),  the  method  for 
calculating the energy loss as shown for the above two cases by simply taking an element directly 
from the fluid can not be employed. This is because there is no null velocity in the flow. In this 
case, the flow has to be firstly decomposed into two simple parts (see Fig.6). The velocity profile 
aU1 )  and  a  uniform  flow  (velocity 
is  decomposed  as  a  simple  shear  flow  (maximum  velocity 
bU ).  The  total  energy  loss  is  the  sum  from  the  two  velocity  profiles.  The  energy  loss  for  the 
simple shear flow (part a) can be calculated using the same method provided in section 2.1 for the 
case of only a single moving plate. The result is similar to equation (8),

where  
 
 
For the part b in Fig.6, this is a uniform flow (rigid body moving) and the viscous friction 
is zero in the whole flow field. Thus, the energy loss is zero due to no viscous friction in the flow 
field. Therefore, the total energy loss for two plates moving in the same direction is the value as 
expressed by Eq.(14), which is the same as that for one plate moving and the other plate remained 
fix.  The  only  issue  is  to  change  or  set  the  correct  magnitude  of  the  velocity  from  u  to 
u
. Strictly, this is equivalent to changing the coordinate system. That is, the frame of 
bU .  The  energy  loss  in  the  new  moving 
reference  is  moving  with  the  flow  in  a  uniform  speed 
coordinate system is the same as that of the previous fixed coordinate system. The distribution of

energy loss is shown in Fig.7. The energy loss increases with decreasing y, and it tends towards 
infinity at the bottom even if the velocity at the bottom plate is not zero. From the examples of 
plane  Couette  flow,  it  is  found  that  the  position  of  extreme  energy  loss  occurs  always  at  the 
location of lowest velocity.

 is  constant  along  the  streamwise  direction.  The  energy  loss

This expression at the limit of infinite radii of cylinders is the same as that for plane Couette flow. 
 
The  distribution  of  energy  loss  calculated  using  Eq.  (28)  is  depicted  in  Fig.10,  for  the 
case  of  inner  cylinder  rotating  while  the  outer  cylinder  is  at  rest.  In  this  figure,  the  radius  ratio 
90.0=η
 is used. It can be seen that the energy loss increases with increasing r along the width 
of the channel, and it tends to be infinite at the surface of the outer cylinder. Thus, the flow at the 
outer cylinder is strongly stable.  Therefore, any small disturbance in the locality is likely to be 
damped  out.  The  fluid  particles  near  the  inner  cylinder  have  the  smallest  energy  loss.  This 
becomes a possible locality where instability can first occur, as generally observed in experiments 
[3,5,8]. This behaviour has important implication for some industrial processes.

Eqs.(16) and (17) for the velocity distribution still hold. For this case, Eq.(17) can be rearranged 
as

In this case, taking an element in the fluid flow (Fig.8b), and using the same procedure as

are still hold for this case. By substituting Eq.(16) and (33) into Eq.(27), then Eq.(34) is obtained,

This expression at the limit of infinite radii of cylinders is also the same as that for plane Couette 
flow. 
 
The  distribution  of  energy  loss  calculated  using  Eq.  (34)  is  depicted  in  Fig.11,  for  the 
case of outer cylinder rotating while the inner cylinder is at rest. It can be seen that the energy 
loss decreases with increasing r along the width of the channel, and it tends to be infinite at the 
surface of the inner cylinder. Thus, the flow at the inner cylinder is strongly stable, and the flow 
at the out cylinder is most unstable.  The flow behaviour for this case is very different from that 
for  the  case  of  inner  cylinder  rotating  and  outer  cylinder  at  rest.  At  this  situation,  Taylor  cell 
vortices  pattern  is  skipped  and  the  flow  directly  transits  to  turbulence  like  as  in  plane  Couette 
flow when the critical condition is reached as found in experiments [5,19]. However, the flow in 
this situation has not been obtained sufficient concern in the past [19].

The distribution of energy loss calculated with Eq.(39) is shown in Fig.12 and Fig.13 for 
 
2ω .  The  energy  loss  decreases  with  decreasing  radial  position 
different  combination  of 
near the inner cylinder and increasing radial position near the outer cylinder; it tends to be infinite 
at one particular position between the cylinders. The location of this position depends on the ratio 
of  the  angular  velocities  of  two  cylinders.  Therefore,  by  changing  the  angular  velocities  of  the 
two cylinders, this position can be moved between the cylinders. Due to the infinite energy loss at 
this  position,  the  flow  at  this  point  is  strongly  stable.    Therefore,  any  small  disturbances  in  the 
said locality are likely to be damped out. The fluid particles near the cylinder surfaces have the 
smallest  energy  loss.  Therefore,  the  instability  generally  occurs  on  the  cylinder  surfaces.  The 
occurrence  of  instability  may  take  place  first  on  the  inner  cylinder  or  the  outer  cylinder, 
depending on other factors such as influences from radius of cylinders and the magnitudes of the 
rotating speeds. If the flow at the inner cylinder exceeds the critical condition, Taylor vortex cell 
pattern  may  first  occur  along  the  inner  cylinder.    If  the  flow  at  the  outer  cylinder  exceeds  the 
critical condition, the flow near the outer cylinder may directly transit to turbulence. If both of the 
flow  at  the  inner  cylinder  and  the  flow  at  the  outer  cylinder  exceed  their  critical  conditions, 
complex flow pattern may be formed. 
 
3.4 Two cylinders rotating in same direction 
 
When the two cylinders rotate in the same direction (Fig.8d), the method for calculating 
the energy loss used for above-mentioned two cases can not be directly employed. This is because 
there is no null velocity in the flow. As such,, the energy loss can not be simply obtained as for 
the case of single cylinder rotating. In this case, the flow can be decomposed as two simple flows 
(see Fig.14). The velocity profile is decomposed into two parts: (a) the inner cylinder is rotating 
and the outer cylinder is rest (part a); (b) rigid body rotating (part b). The selection of the angular 
velocity of rigid body rotating is such that 
, and the angular velocity in the flow field for 

 

2ωω =b

part  a  is 

ωωω
b

=

−

a

.  Thus,  the  angular  velocities  at  the  two  cylinders  for  part  a  are

 and

. The angular velocity for part b of rigid body rotating is 

= 1
ωωω
b
ωωω
= 2
. The total energy loss is the sum of the two velocity profiles of rotating flows. 
b
Now, the energy loss for the part a can be calculated using the same method as that in section 3.1 
for the case of only one cylinder rotating. The result obtained is similar to Eq.(28), and is given 
by

For the part b in Fig.14, this is a rigid body rotating flow and the shear stress is zero in 
the whole flow field. Therefore, the energy loss for the part b is zero due to no viscous friction. 
Thus, the total energy loss for two cylinder rotating in same direction can be calculated just by 
Eq.(40),  which  is  the  same  as  that  for  the  inner  cylinder  rotating  and  the  outer  cylinder  at  rest 
(Eq.(28)).  The  only  requirement  is  to  change  the  magnitude  of  the  velocity  from  ω  to

Therefore, the behaviour of energy loss for the two cases is identical. It can be seen from Fig.15 
that the energy loss increases with increasing r along the width of the channel, and it tends to be 
infinite at the surface of the outer cylinder. The flow at the inner cylinder has lowest energy loss. 
Thus, the flow at the outer cylinder is strongly stable and the flow near the inner cylinder is most 
unstable. From this case, it is found that even if the flow velocity is not zero at the outer cylinder, 
the energy loss also tends towards infinity. Therefore, summarizing all the studied four cases, it is 
found that there is always a location in Taylor-Couette flow at which the velocity is the lowest 
and the energy loss is towards infinity.         
 
Taylor  was  able  to  determine  the  critical  condition  of  insatbility  in  the  flow  between 
concentric rotating cylinders via a mathematical stability analysis for viscous flow [8]. Strictly, in 
Taylor’s  analysis,  it  has  also  included  the  influence  of  energy  loss  as  indicated  by  the  Taylor 
number although the energy loss distribution is not considered.  However, the present theory does 
not  in  any  way  contradict  Taylor’s  analysis.  On  other  hand,  the  present  analysis  reveals  a 
potential  mechanism  found  in  most  flow  problems.  We  surmise  that  the  principle  of  loss 
distribution  is  universal  for  most  if  not  all  flow  problems.  We  further  suggest  that  the  loss 
distribution  plays  a  partial  but  important  role  in  flow  instabilities.  It  either  strengthens  or 
diminishes  the  likelihood  of  occurrence  of  flow  instability  in  the  flows  according  to  the 
distribution.

4. Concluding Remarks 
 
In this work, the method for calculating the energy loss distribution in the Taylor-Couette 
flow  between  concentric  rotating  cylinders  has  been  proposed.  The  principle  and  the  detailed 
derivation for the calculation are given for single cylinder rotating of inner or outer cylinder, and 
counter  and  same  direction  rotating  of  two  cylinders.  The  distribution  of  energy  loss  due  to 
viscosity  in  plane  Couette  flow  and  Taylor-Couette  flow  between  concentric  rotating  cylinders 
‘are derived  and discussed for various flow conditions. The findings have potentially important 
bearings on the flow stability and turbulence transition and hence great significance in the relation 
to  many  aspects  of  processes  like  mixing  and  heat  transfer  and  others.  The  findings  will  be 
helpful  for  clarifying  some  complex  flow  phenomena  and  useful  for  the  design  of  related 
industrial devices. 
 
For plane Couette flow, the flow on the surface of moving plate has lowest energy loss if 
only  one  plate  is  moving.  The  flow  at  this  location  has  lowest  damp  mode  in  response  to  any 
disturbance imposed, and hence the possibility that instability may occur first. The position of the 
highest energy loss occurring at the location of lowest velocity implies the presence of strongest 
damping to any perturbation. Thus, the flow at this said position tends to be stable. By changing 
the speed of the two plates, this stable location can move between the two plates.  
 
For Taylor-Couette flow between concentric rotating cylinders with one at rest, the flow 
on the surface of the rotating cylinder has lowest energy loss. The flow at the said position has 
therefore  lowest  damping  mechanism  in  the  response  to  any  disturbance.  The  possibility  exists 
that  instability  may  occur  more  readily;  on  the  other  hand,  highest  energy  loss  occurs  at  the 
location  of  lowest  velocity  in  the  flow.  The  corresponding  presence  of  strongest  damping 
mechanism at such position may imply the most stable region.  
If  the  inner  cylinder  is  rotating 
and the outer cylinder is at rest, the flow at the inner cylinder is most unstable, and while the flow 
at  the  outer  cylinder  is  most  stable.  If  the  inner  cylinder  is  at  rest  and  the  outer  cylinder  is 
rotating, the flow near the outer cylinder is most unstable, and while the flow at the inner cylinder 
is most stable.  
 
For the counter rotating cylinders, the position of largest energy loss is located between 
the cylinders. By changing the angular velocities of the two cylinders, this position can be shifted 
between the cylinders. The most unstable locations are at the rotating cylinders in terms of their 
speeds.  The flow stability and the flow pattern depend on the geometry and the rotating speeds of 
cylinders relative to their critical conditions. 
For two cylinders rotating in same direction, the behaviour of energy loss is similar to the 
 
case of only one cylinder rotating. When the energy loss is calculated, the velocity profile must be 
decomposed into two parts, of which one should be rigid body rotating. The total energy loss is 
the  sum  of  two  velocity profiles.    It  is  found  that even  if  there  is  no  location  of  velocity  being 
null, there is always a position at which the energy loss tends towards infinity.  
 
By summarizing the results for plane Couette flow and Taylor-Couette flow, it is found in 
shear driven flows that there is always a point at which the velocity is the lowest and the energy 
loss is towards infinity. Owing to strong damping role of energy loss to disturbance, the flow is 
most  stable  at  the  said  location.  This  may  be  the  reason  of  the  stability  of  some  type  of vortex 
flows.

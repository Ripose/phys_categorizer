I.  INTRODUCTION 

The ~10 million channels in the Compact Muon Solenoid 
(CMS)  Tracker  sub-detector  are  read-out  by  40  000  analog 
optical  links  [1].  These  are embedded  in  the data  acquisition 
system  shown  in  Figure  1.  The  current  optical  links  employ 
Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) at 40MS/s. The Signal to 
Noise Ratio (SNR) of the system is specified so that the link 
has  an  equivalent  digital  resolution  of  at  least  8  bits.  Hence, 
the  analog  modulation  scheme  is  akin  to  digital  baseband 
PAM  using  256  distinct  levels  (8  bits)  at  40MHz.  The 
equivalent data-rate is 320Mbits/s (=8×40MHz). 

II. DIGITAL COMMUNICATION BASICS 

The work described in this paper refers to the development 
of a digital communication system, which can be represented 
by  the  generic  blocks  shown  in  Figure  2.  In  our  case,  the 
analog  channel  is  the  current  CMS  Tracker  optical  link.  The 
choice  of  digital  modulation  (performed  by  the  channel 
encoder  block  of  Figure  2)  depends  on  the  characteristics  of 
the channel through which signals are sent, and the trade-off 
between  bandwidth-efficiency  and  transmitted  power.  This 
paper  is  primarily  concerned  with  the  channel  encoding  and 
analog channel blocks. 

 

Figure 1: CMS Tracker readout system. 

In  the  context  of  a  SLHC  upgrade  [2],  it  is  proposed  to 
convert  these  links  to  a  digital  system  in  order  to  achieve 
higher  data-rates  using  the  current  analog  link  components. 
The  high  cost  of  development  of  new  optoelectronic 
components  able  to  match  the  physical  and  environmental 
constraints of a high energy physics experiment provides the 
motivation  behind  re-using  the  current  link  components. 
Additional  components  on  either  side  of  the  existing  links 
would  be  required  to  perform  the  necessary  digitization, 
digital  transmission  and  reception.  The  main  constraints  are 
the bandwidth of the link and available signal power, limited 
by  the  transmitter  hybrid  (AOH)  and  the  optoelectronic 
receiver  amplifier  (ARx12)  [1].  Therefore,  a  bandwidth 
efficient  digital  modulation  scheme  is  required  to  achieve 
transmission at Gbit/s rates.  

The  aim  of  this  project  is  to  determine  the  approximate 
data-rate  and  corresponding  Bit  Error  Rate  (BER)  at  which

A.  The Channel: Current Optical Link 
The  frequency  response  of  a  complete  optical  link  was 
measured  using  a  Spectrum  Analyzer  (Figure  3).  A  circuit 
based  on  a  differential  driver  IC  was  used  at  the  spectrum 
analyzer  output  in  order  to  adapt  it  to  the  AOH  input.  The 
response  of  this  circuit  was  subtracted  from  the  response  of 
the  whole  link.  The  ripple  observed  at  higher  frequencies 
could  be  a  feature  of  the  measurement  system  used,  and  are 
not necessarily a true representation of the link’s response.

The noise of the link has been specified over 100MHz for 
a  peak  Signal  to  Noise  Ratio  (SNR)  of  48dB  [3].  In  the 
analysis  of  the  following  sections,  we  will  extrapolate  and 
assume a constant noise power spectral density (PSD) for all 
frequencies. 

B.  Channel Encoding: Bandwidth Efficiency 
The encoder modulates the analog signal passing through 
the  channel  with  digital  information.  Our  objective  is  to 
maximize  the  data  rate  in  our  system,  and  hence  bandwidth-
efficient digital modulation schemes need to be considered. 

In 1948, Claude E. Shannon defined the capacity, C, as the 
maximum number of information bits per channel use that can 
be  transmitted  over  an  additive  white  Gaussian  noise 
(AWGN)  communication  channel  with  an  arbitrarily  small 
probability of error [4]:

The  SNR  in  the  above  equation  is defined as  the  ratio of

‘Shannon  Limit’  is  useful  for  evaluating  the  performance  of 
digital communication systems, since it is an objective metric; 
Shannon  never  specified  what  type  of  modulation,  encoding 
or  Forward  Error  Correction  (FEC)  is  required  to  attain  this 
limit.  An  alternative  form  of  the  Shannon  Capacity  equation

C.  Quadrature Amplitude Modulation 
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) is a bandwidth- 
efficient, passband modulation technique. The data in a QAM 
system  is  modulated  onto  a  higher  frequency  sinusoidal 
carrier.  Information

amplitude and phase of the carrier. More details on QAM can

is  conveyed  by  varying  both 

A single QAM carrier could be used in the CMS Tracker 
optical link to increase the bandwidth efficiency compared to 
the  current  PAM  scheme.  However,  QAM  requires  the 
channel to have a flat magnitude response over the bandwidth 
it occupies. Our channel is frequency-selective and this causes 
InterSymbol  Interference  in  the  QAM  signal  [6].  A  typical 
solution would be to employ an equalizer at the receiver. This 
is a digital filter with a frequency response that is the inverse 
of  that  of  the  channel.  At  present,  the  variation  in  frequency 
response from link to link is not known, meaning we cannot 
be sure that one set of equalizer coefficients would be suitable 
for all optical links. If this is not the case, a computationally 
expensive  adaptive  equalizer  would  have  to  be  designed  for 
the  receiver,  and  this  is  probably  impractical  for  the  Gbit/s 
data-rates  that  we  hope  to  achieve.  Nevertheless,  single-
carrier  modulation  should  not  be  ruled  out,  and  this  option 
will be explored in the near future.

the channel. 

D.  Multiple QAM Carriers 
An  alternative  way  of  avoiding  ISI  in  a  frequency-
selective  environment  is  to  divide  the  channel  into  N  sub-
channels, and place a QAM modulated carrier in each. For a 
large  enough  N,  each  sub-channel  will  have  a  flat  frequency 
response,  hence  eliminating  the  need  for  equalization  at  the 
receiver. Figure 4 is an illustration of the sub-channel concept, 
with each arrow representing a QAM modulated carrier.

ORTHOGONAL FREQUENCY DIVISION 

MULTIPLEXING 
A  multi-carrier  scheme  which  is  of  great  interest  is 
Orthogonal  Frequency  Division  Multiplexing  (OFDM)  [5] 
[6].  It  is  widely  used  in  high-data  rate  applications  such  as 
ADSL and Wi-Fi. OFDM makes efficient use of the channel 
bandwidth  by  allowing  spectral  overlap  between  adjacent 
carriers. For reception without InterCarrier Interference (ICI) 
the carriers must be mathematically orthogonal. The receiver 
acts as a bank of demodulators, translating each carrier down 
to  DC,  with  the  resulting  signal  integrated  over  a  symbol 
period to recover the baseband data. If the other carriers have 
frequencies that, in the time domain, have an integer number 
of cycles in the symbol period T, then the integration process 
results in zero contribution from all these other carriers. Thus, 
the carriers are linearly independent if the carrier spacing is a 
multiple of 1/T. This is illustrated in Figure 5.

(right) OFDM sub-channels 

 

A.  OFDM System Design 
In  this  section  we  attempt  to  estimate  the  data-rate 
possible using OFDM over the CMS Tracker optical link. The 
analysis  is  based  mainly  on  the  work  by  Cioffi  [7]  [8].  We 
start by discussing the peak power issues in OFDM. We then 
introduce the concept of the SNR gap [8] that determines the 
number  of  bits/symbol  (and  therefore  data-rate)  for  a  single 
QAM carrier. Finally we define the multi-channel SNR [8], a 
measure that defines an equivalent single carrier performance 

metric  for  a  multi-carrier  system,  and  this  simplifies  the 
calculation of the achievable data-rate. 

1)  OFDM Power Issues 

A  major  drawback of OFDM is  the  high peak-to-average 
power  ratio  (PAPR)  of  the  transmitted  signal  [9].  The  peak 
signal occurs when all sub-carriers add coherently, and it can 
be shown that the peak power of an OFDM signal is equal to 
the number of carriers (N) times the average power. Clearly, 
PAPR is a problem for the transmitter amplifier, since it must 
accommodate  these  large  signals  in  order  to  avoid  signal 
clipping  which  leads  to  intermodulation  interference  and 
therefore bit-errors. This is achieved by lowering (or ‘backing 
off’)  the  average  power  of  the  transmitted  signal,  so  that  the 
signal  peaks  fit  in  the  transmitter’s  input  range.  Power 
consumption of a power amplifier depends largely on the peak 
power,  and  hence  accommodating  occasional  large  peaks 
leads to low power efficiency. This so-called power ‘backoff’ 
leads  to  lower  signal power,  and  hence  lower SNR  available 
for data transmission.  

As an example, consider the case of a multi-carrier system 
with  a  PAPR=256.  The  backoff  required  for  completely 
avoiding signal clipping is 10⋅log10(256)=12dB. However, the 
resulting SNR reduction could lead to a severely lower data-
rate for a given BER. Practical OFDM systems do not employ 
such a large backoff, at the expense of a tolerable degradation 
in BER. The chosen backoff of the transmitted signal is thus a 
compromise  between  the  contradictory  desires  to  achieve  a 
large  average  transmit  power  on  the  one  hand  and  a  low 
distortion due to clipping of the signal on the other [9]. 

However,  high  signal  peaks  in  OFDM  occur  rarely.  The 
amplitude  of  an  N-carrier  OFDM  signal  has  a  Rayleigh 
distribution  with  zero  mean,  and  a  variance  of  N  times  the 
variance  of  one  complex  sinusoid  [10].  Given  the  signal 
statistics,  one  can  calculate  the  BER  penalty  incurred  due  to 
signal  clipping  and  select  the  optimum  power  backoff  for  a 
particular 
is 
implementation-specific,  and  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this 
work.  We  will,  instead,  use  typical  backoff  values  from  the 
literature  [11]  [12]  in  our  calculations,  and  show  what  data-
rate can be attained, ignoring any resultant BER degradation.

2)  SNR Gap Analysis 

‘SNR gap analysis’ will be described here for a single sub-
channel  (i.e.  one  QAM  carrier)  as  an  introduction  to  the 
concepts  relevant 
to  multi-carrier  system  design.  The 
equations  needed  for  calculating  the  maximum  bit-rate  in  a 
single-carrier QAM system are presented. 

A channel with double-sided noise power spectral density 
N0,  signal  energy  ,  and  channel  gain 
|H|  has  a 
SNR=⋅|H|2/N0.  The  maximum  bit-rate  achievable  over  a 
bandwidth, BW, in this channel is given by a variation of the 
Shannon Capacity:

(3) 

Γ  is  the  ‘SNR  gap’.  When  Γ=1  (0dB),  Eq.3  is  equal  to 
Eq.2,  and  b  is  the  capacity  of  the  channel.  Any  reliable  and 
implementable system must transmit at a rate below capacity, 
and hence Γ is a measure of loss with respect to theoretically 
optimum performance. 

The  BER  probability  in  QAM  is  upper-bounded  by  the 
symbol  error  probability,  Pe,  which  is  closely  approximated 
by [6]:

|H| is the channel gain and d is the distance between points 
in  the  uncoded  input  constellation.  It  is  clear  that  the  BER 
depends  on  the  noise  PSD  and  dmin,  itself  depending  on  the 
signal  power  (more  allocated  power  means  greater  distance 
between  the  symbols  in  the  constellation  and  hence  larger 
SNR).  The  SNR  Gap,  Γ (sometimes  called  the  ‘normalized 
SNR’) is defined by [7]:

Note that if we take the square root of 3·Γ we obtain the 
argument to the Q-function of Eq.4. Hence, we can calculate 
Γ  by  first  deciding  on  a  target  BER,  calculating  the 
corresponding  Q-function  argument 
from  Eq.4,  and 
substituting into Eq.7. Substituting Γ into Eq.3 then gives the 
achievable data-rate of a single-carrier QAM system. 

3)  Multi-Carrier QAM Data-Rate 

The  analysis  of  the  previous  section  can  be  extended  to 
OFDM  by  recognizing  that  the  multiple  carriers  occupying 
sub-channels  are  independent  to  each  other.  Hence  the 
aggregate performance of the individual QAM carriers in their 
sub-channels  gives  the  performance  of  the  multiple  carrier 
system in the complete channel. 

The total BER in an OFDM system is simply the average 
of  the  individual  sub-carrier  BERs.  We  assume  that  all 
carriers  carry  equally  important  information,  and  hence  we 
require  the  same  BER  in  each.  Given  the  SNR  in  each  sub-
channel, we can then determine the individual carrier bit-rates 
as described in the previous section. The total bit rate is found 
by simple addition. In equation form:

4)  Multi-carrier Power Allocation 

5)  Equivalent Single-carrier Metric: Multi-channel SNR 

There is a subtle point about the SNR per sub-channel that 
needs  to  be  understood  before  proceeding.  The  SNR  in  each 
OFDM sub-channel depends on how the total power budget is 
allocated. Since we are assuming the noise is white (constant 
PSD,  N0  W/Hz  across  the  whole  bandwidth  of  the  channel), 
the  SNR  of  any  given  sub-channel  will  then  depend  on  the 
power allocated to the corresponding carrier.  

The easiest approach would be to allocate equal power to 
all  carriers.  Let  N=number  of  carriers,  and total=total  power 
budget.  The  power  per  carrier  would  then  be  total/N. 
However, this is a non-optimal solution due to the fact that we 
must impose the restriction that all QAM constellations used 
in  our  uncoded  OFDM  system  must  have  an  integer  number 
of  allocated  bits.  It  can  be  easily  seen  that  Eq.3  can  yield  a 
fractional  bit  allocation  for  a  particular  carrier  –  say  5.3 
bits/symbol. If we are to meet our target BER, we would have 
to  round  down  to  5  bits/symbol.  This  would  be  a  ‘waste’, 
since part of the power allocated would effectively be used for 
lowering the BER in that particular sub-channel. It would be 
more  sensible  to  allocate  this  superfluous  power  to  another 
carrier  in  order  to  increase  its  SNR  and  hence  its  number  of 
allocated bits. 

‘shapes’. 

Ideally,  we  want 

Moreover,  there  are  limitations  imposed  by  the  QAM 
constellation 
rectangular 
constellations  (i.e.  ones  where  the  symbols  can  be  evenly 
spaced,  forming  a  rectangle).  For  example,  if  the  SNR  in  a 
sub-channel allows transmission of 3 bits/symbol, there is no 
efficient way of arranging 23 symbols in a QAM constellation. 
In such  a  case,  it  would be preferable  to  allocate  one  less or 
one more bit to this sub-channel. This would have to be done 
by adjusting the power allocated to that particular carrier.  

The  optimum  power  and  bit-allocation  is  achieved  using 
the  so-called  ‘water-filling’  optimization  [8].  The  exact 
description  of  the  algorithm  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this 
document,  but  a  formulation  of  the  general  optimization 
problem is given here. Our goal is to maximize the sum given 
in Eq.8 by varying the allocated bits/symbol and power. Let gk 
be the sub-channel SNR when unit energy is applied to the kth 
carrier:

gk is a constant for the channel, but   can be modified to 
maximize  btot,  subject  to  the  constraint  of  the  total  power 
budget: 

We  can,  in  fact,  ignore  the  effects  of  the  bit  and  power 
allocation  algorithm  in  determining  the  upper  bound  on  the 
achievable  data-rate  in  a  multi-carrier  system.  The  following 
analysis  makes  the  calculation  extremely  straightforward, 
though one must not forget that the actual data-rate achieved 
in a real system will depend on the chosen power allocation. 

We  start  by  assuming  a  constant  BER  (and  SNR  gap) 
across  all  sub-channels.  This  allows  for  the  use  of  a  single 
performance  measure 
the  multi-channel 
transmission  system.  This  measure  is  a  geometric  SNR  
(SNRm,u)  and  can  be  compared  directly  to  the  detection  SNR 
of a single-carrier system employing equalization.

The  multi-channel SNR  characterizes  all  sub-channels by 
an  equivalent  single  AWGN  channel  that  achieves  the  same 
data-rate.  In  our  calculation  we  use  Eq.12  and  Eq.13  to 
estimate  the  achievable  data-rate  of  an  OFDM  system  given 
the  noise  PSD  and  measured  frequency  response  of  our 
channel. 

6)  Approximate Data-rate Calculation Using Multi-channel 

SNR 

Let  the  channel  be  divided  into  a  large  number  of  sub-
channels, say N=256, with equal power allocated to each sub-
channel.  For  this  approximate  solution  to  work,  we  need  to 
determine  the  total  frequency  range  that  will  be  occupied by 
our  QAM  carriers.  The  low-pass  response  of  our  channel 
makes  this  straightforward,  since  we  need  only  find  the 
highest  frequency  at  which  the  256th  carrier  can  transmit 
1bit/symbol. Since we are assuming equal power distribution 
in  all  carriers,  it  follows  that  they  must  all  transmit  data. 
Modifying Eq.3 to a more general form, we can calculate the 
number  of  bits/symbol  on  a  QAM  carrier,  given  a  channel 
SNR:

Finally, 

the  noise  PSD 

is  an  estimate  based  on 
specifications  and  is  assumed  to  be  constant  across  all 
frequencies.  This  probably  over-estimates  the  noise,  and 
hence  it  is  the  cautious  approach.  A  range  of  constant  noise 
PSD  values  was  used  in  order  to  determine  the  effect  that  a 
wrong estimate can have on the achievable data-rate. 

By setting C=1 (and with Γ determined by the target BER 
using  Eq.4  and  Eq.7),  the  minimum  SNR  required  for 
transmitting  1  bit/symbol  can  be  found.  As  an  example, 
consider  the  case  where  a  target  BER  of  10-9  is  set.  The 
required  SNR  for  transmitting  1bit/symbol  is  then  ~16dB.  A 
normalized  (with  respect  to  a  maximum  input  signal  of  1W) 
value  of  N0  has  been  calculated  for  our  channel,  and  the 
power allocated to each carrier in our calculation can be found 
from  =/256.  The  SNR  at  the  kth  sub-channel  is  then

bandwidth of the 256th (last) sub-channel. In OFDM, the sub-
channel bandwidth (i.e., carrier spacing) is determined by the 
chosen  symbol  rate,  and  hence,  we  need  to  find  the  carrier 
frequency  at  which  the  SNR256~16dB.  This  frequency  (we 
shall  call  it  fmax)  is  the  upper  limit  to  the  channel  bandwidth 
that can be used. 

From the above, we have also determined the symbol rate 
per  carrier  of  our  theoretical  system  (=fmax/256).  Hence,  the 
256  QAM  carriers  will  be  centered  at 
the  following 
frequencies:

From  Eq.16,  we  calculate  the  SNR  at  each  sub-channel. 
Substituting  these  values  into  Eq.13,  and  given  the  value  of 
the  SNR  gap,  we  obtain  SNRm,u.  Finally,  substituting  into 
Eq.12, we determine the bit-rate of our system. 

B.  Results 
The method described in the previous section was used to 
estimate the achievable data-rate using OFDM over the CMS 
Tracker  Analog  optical  links.  Of  course,  the  accuracy  of  the 
results depends  on  the  accuracy  of  the  assumptions. In order 
to  produce  an  unbiased  first-order  estimate  and  evaluate  the 
effect of errors, we have varied the main design parameters to 
obtain a range of data-rates. Firstly, various target error rates 
were used. While Eq.4 is only an approximation of the upper 
bound  on  the  BER,  this  uncertainty  is  effectively  removed 
when changing the error rate by a few orders of magnitude. 

The  total  power  available  to  the  system  was  estimated 
given  the  linear  input  range  to  the  AOH  (transmitter).  The 
peak signal that can be sent through the link is assumed to be 
600mV.  Non-linearities  within  and  outside  this  input  range 
are  not  considered  in  the  analysis.  In  our  analysis  the  peak 
power  has  been  normalized  to  1W,  and  this  corresponds  to 
using  the  full  AOH  input  range.  We  have  used  a  number  of 
power backoff values, knowing that typical numbers found in 
literature regardless of carrier number are 3-9dB [11] [12].

Figure 6: Data-rate as a function of transmitted signal power (and 
power backoff in dB) for various target BERs. 

Figure  6  shows 

the  data-rate  against  normalized 
transmitted  signal  power  (and  power  backoff  in  dB).  The 
results are shown for four different target BERs. The shaded 
area corresponds to the backoff range of 3-6dB, which is the 
range we are likely to operate in. At a BER of 10-9, the data 
rate in this region of operation ranges from 2.3 to 2.7Gbits/s. 
The  corresponding  bandwidth  efficiency  is  ~6-6.5bits/s/Hz. 
This can be compared to the bandwidth efficiencies of Wi-Fi 
(~3bits/s/Hz), and ADSL (typically up to ~6bits/s/Hz).

Figure 7: Data-rate as a function of transmitted signal power (and 
power backoff in dB) for various noise PSDs. 

In  order  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  possible  error  in  the 
average noise PSD used in the calculations, the data-rate for a 
fixed  error  rate  (BER=10-9)  was  computed  as  a  function  of 
transmitted signal power for various noise PSDs. The results 
are  shown  in  Figure  7.  The  middle  curve  corresponds  to  the 
noise PSD, N0, calculated from the specification of the optical 
link. Results were obtained for higher noise (10·N0 and 2·N0) 
as well as lower noise (N0/10 and N0/2). The result shows that 
if  the  error  on  the  average  noise  PSD  is  of  the  order  of 
≤100%,  the  calculated  data-rate  varies  by  ≤400Kbits/s 
(≤15%). 

In  practice,  the  data-rate  in  an  OFDM  scheme  could  be 
lower by ~10-20% due to the inclusion of the so-called cyclic 
is  essentially  a  sequence  of  redundant 
prefix,  which 
information. This is required to maintain orthogonality of the 
carriers,  and  is  normally  chosen  to  be  at  least  as  long  as  the 
impulse response of the channel [5].

The above calculations do not include all effects that may 
be  encountered  in  a  practical  system.  Phase  noise,  non-
linearities 
transfer  function  and  frequency 
instabilities can adversely affect the system’s performance. At 
this  stage,  we  have  little  or  no  data  that  can  be  used  to 
evaluate  the  significance  of  these  effects  on  our  chosen 
modulation  scheme.  It  follows  that  performance  of  any 
advanced digital communication scheme is heavily dependent 
on the actual hardware implementation. 

Another  source  of  uncertainty  is  the  frequency  response 
measurement  made  on  the  optical  link,  due  to  the  limited 
accuracy  of  the  instrument  used,  as  well  as  the  presence  of

output buffer amplifiers.

Finally,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  results  are  for  an 
uncoded  system.  Forward  Error  Correction  (FEC)  and  other 
codes can be used to decrease the BER in the system, hence 
allowing  transmission  at  higher  speeds.  These  will  be 
investigated in the future. 

C.  Future Plans 
In order to assess the accuracy of the assumptions made in 
this paper, we intend to conduct lab measurements involving 
the  transmission  of  QAM  signals  through  the  link.  A  single-
carrier  QAM  signal  will  be  created  using  an  Arbitrary 
Waveform  Generator  desktop  instrument  interfaced  to  the 
AOH.  The  signal  will  be  demodulated  either  by  a  Spectrum 
Analyzer, or captured by a Real-Time scope and demodulated 
offline  using  MATLAB.  This  test  will  ultimately  determine 
the feasibility of using QAM through the optical link. It will 
be possible to assess the impact of amplitude and phase noise, 
and  hence  determine  the  number  of  bits/symbol  that  can  be 
transmitted on a QAM carrier at various frequencies. One can 
also  establish  the  maximum  symbol  rate  that  can  be  used 
before ISI becomes an issue. The knowledge gained will then 
be  used  to  extrapolate  the  performance  of  a  multi-carrier 
scheme.

CONCLUSIONS 

We  have  described  the  first  attempt  to  calculate  the 
achievable  data-rate  using  a  bandwidth-efficient  modulation 
scheme  over  the  CMS  Tracker  Analog  optical  link.  The 
calculation is based on test data and specifications of current 
link  components,  and  where  necessary,  extrapolations  have 
been made to account for unknown characteristics of the link. 

Based  on  the  assumptions  made,  data-rates  of  over  ~2.5 
Gbits/s  should  be  possible  in  a  future  system  based  on  the 
current  link  components.  Hardware  verification  tests  are 

planned, and the next step will be to assess the complexity of 
an OFDM implementation. It will then be possible to evaluate 
whether the data-rate increase is worth the investment in extra 
components and implementation complexity.

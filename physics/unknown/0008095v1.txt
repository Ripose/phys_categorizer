1  INTRODUCTION 

Beam  position-phase  monitors  in  the  SNS  linac  will 
deliver  information  about  both  the  transverse  position  of 
the beam and the beam phase. Typical values for the beam 
position accuracy are on the order of 0.1 mm within 1/3 of 
the bore radius rb from the axis (rb is 12.5 mm to 20 mm 
for the normal conducting part of the linac). The BPPMs 
have  a  high  signal  processing  frequency,  equal  to  the 
microbunch  repetition  frequency  in  the  linac,  fb=402.5 
MHz (or its 2nd harmonics, 805 MHz). The beam phase 
measurement  within  a  fraction  of  an  RF  degree  is  also 
required from the SNS linac BPPMs.  

Various  options  for  the  transducers  (pickups)  of  the 
SNS linac BPPMs have been studied using the EM code 
MAFIA  [3]  in  [1,2].  Electrostatic  2-D  computations  are 
used to adjust the pickup cross-section parameters to form 
50-Ω  transmission  lines.  3-D  static  and  time-domain 
computations  were  applied  to  calculate  the  electrode 
coupling.  Time-domain  3-D  simulations  with  SNS  beam 
microbunches  passing  through  the  BPPM  at  a  varying 
offset  from  the  axis  were  used  to  compute  the  induced 
voltages on the electrodes as functions of time. After that 
an FFT procedure extracted the amplitudes and phases of 
the signal harmonics at individual outputs, as well as the 
amplitude  and  phase  of  the  combined  (summed)  signal, 
versus the beam transverse position. This information was 
used  to  choose  an  optimal  BPPM  design.  Section  2 
summarizes the results of this study. 

In  the  SNS  linac,  there  is  a  rare  opportunity  to  put 
BPPMs and steering magnets inside the drift tubes in the 
drift-tube  linac  (DTL)  to  provide  a  better  quality  beam. 
This  is  due to the fact that every third drift tube (DT) is 
empty.  The  DTL  RF  fields,  however,  will  produce  an 
additional  signal  in  BPPMs  inside  DTs  at  the  DTL  RF 
frequency  402.5  MHz that can exclude the BPPM signal 
processing at this frequency. For the coupled-cavity linac 
(CCL) there is no such problem, since its RF frequency is 
805  MHz.  In  Sect. 3  we  study  the  feasibility  of  using 
BPPMs in the DTL. 

2   BPPM MODELING 

2.1  BPPM Design 

After  considering  a  few  possible  pickup  designs,  we 
decided  to  choose  a  BPM  design  having  4  stripline 
electrodes with one end shorted. A MAFIA model of the 
BPM  consists  of  a  cylindrical  enclosure  (box)  with  4 
electrodes  on  a  beam  pipe,  see  Fig. 1.  Each  electrode 
covers a subtended angle of 60°. They are flush with the 
beam pipe, shorted at one end, and have 50-Ω connectors 
on  the  other  end.  For  the  CCL  beam  pipe  radius  rb=20 
mm, the electrode length along the beam is taken to be 40 
mm.  The  50-Ω  electrode  connectors  are  modeled  by 
discrete elements, 50-Ω resistors in this case. This design 
is  non-directional,  provides  a  rigid  mechanical  structure, 
has  all  four connectors on one end, and therefore can be 
mounted close to quadrupoles or fit inside a DT.

tapered box end and electrodes (dark) with ridged 

transitions to connectors (shown as red pins). 

2.2  Position Measurements 

Direct  3D  time-domain  computations  with  an  ultra 
relativistic (β=1) bunch passing the structure at the axis or 
parallel  to  the  axis  have  been  performed.  A  Gaussian 

the  rms 

longitudinal charge distribution of the bunch with the total 
length  σ=5  mm, 
charge  Q=0.14  nC  and 
corresponding  to  the  56-mA  current  in  the  baseline  SNS 
regime with 2-MW beam power at 60 Hz, was used in the 
simulations. Presently, the MAFIA time-domain code T3 
cannot  simulate  the  open  (or  waveguide)  boundary 
conditions on the beam pipe ends for non-ultra relativistic 
(β<1)  beams.  The  ultra  relativistic  MAFIA  results  are 
used  to  fix  parameters  of  an  analytical  model  of  the 
BPPM  at  β=1,  and  then  to  extrapolate  results  for  β<1 
analytically.  

To  study  the  BPM  linearity,  we  perform  simulations 
with  the  beam  bunch  passing  through  the  BPM  with 
different  transverse  offsets.  The  amplitudes  ÃP  and  the 
phases  of  the  Fourier  transforms  of  the  induced  voltages 
on all four (P=R,T,L,B  for the right, top, left and bottom) 
electrodes  are  calculated  as  the  functions  of  the  beam 
transverse  position.  The  BPM  position  sensitivity  was 
found to be equal to 20log10(ÃR/ÃL)/x ≅1.4 dB/mm. At high 
beam  energies  the  signal  power  at  402.5  MHz  changes 
between +4.6 dBm and –12.3 dBm for the beam position 
within  a  rather  wide  range,  {x,y∈(-rb/2,rb/2)},  i.e.  the 
signal  dynamical  range  is  16.9  dB.  The  BPM  linearity 
results  are  presented  in  Fig. 2.  MAFIA data showing the 
horizontal  signal  log  ratio  ln(ÃR/ÃL)/2  or  the  difference-
over-sum  (ÃR-ÃL)/(ÃR+ÃL)  for  different  vertical  beam 
positions  overlap,  so  that  it  is  difficult  to  distinguish 
between the five interpolating lines in each group. We can 
conclude that this BPM design is insensitive to the beam 
position in the direction orthogonal to the measured one, 
and has a good linearity.

2.3  Analytical Model of BPM 

Assuming  an  axial  symmetry  of  the  beam  pipe,  the 
signals on the BPM electrodes of inner radius rb and angle 
ϕ can be calculated by integrating induced currents within 
the  electrode  angular  extent.  For  a  pencil  beam  bunch 

passing  the  BPM  at  the  transverse  position  x=rcosθ, 
y=rsinθ at velocity v=βc, the signals are (e.g., [4]):

where E=R,T,L,B are the Fourier amplitudes at frequency 
f  of  the  voltages  on  the  electrodes,  (µ,ν)  are  (0,0) for  R, 
(0,π/2) for  T, (π,0) for  L, (π,π/2) for  B, and  Im(z) are the 
modified  Bessel  functions.  All  dependence  on  frequency 
and energy is through g=2πf/(βγc), and overall coefficient 
C depends on the beam current.  

The  parameters  rb  and  ϕ  can  be  considered  as  “free” 
parameters  of  the  model.  To  find  their  effective  values, 
we fit with Eqs. (1) the MAFIA results for β=1 at 402.5 
MHz for the ratio S/(x/rb), where S is either ln(ÃR/ÃL)/2 or 
(ÃR-ÃL)/(ÃR+ÃL).  The  best  fit  to  the  numerical  data  was 
obtained  [1]  with  the  effective  parameters  reff=1.17rb, 
ϕ
eff=1.24ϕ  (=74.5°),  where  rb=20  mm,  ϕ=60° are  the 
geometrical  values.  Matching  the  amplitude  of  402.5-
MHz  harmonics  from  an  on-axis  relativistic  SNS  beam 
bunch  with  Eqs. (1)  fixes  the  constant  C=1.232  V.  Then 
the  model  reproduces  MAFIA-computed  402.5-MHz 
signal  amplitudes  for  the  displaced  beams  with  accuracy 
1-2%.  Assuming  the  effective  parameters  of  the  model 
applicable  also  at  lower  beam  velocities,  we  extrapolate 
β=1 results to β<1. The signal power level for the on-axis 
beam is reduced by about 9 dB at β=0.073 (2.5 MeV). For 
the strongest signal in the beam displacement range (-rb/2, 
rb/2) both vertically and horizontally, this reduction is 4.4 
dB, and for the weakest one it is 12.9 dB. As a result, the 
dynamical range of the 402.5-MHz signal would increase 
from about 17 dB for β=1 to about 25 dB at β=0.073, if 
the same radius of BPM were assumed.  
2.4  Phase Measurements 

Two  candidates  for  the  beam  phase  detectors  for  the 
SNS linac – the capacitive probes and BPMs, either with 
signals from individual electrodes or with summed signals 
–  have  been  studied  and  compared  in  Ref. [2].  MAFIA 
simulations  with  an  ultra-relativistic  beam,  as  well  as 
measurements  (for  the  capacitive  probes),  have  shown  a 
strong  dependence  of  the  measured  beam  phase  on  the 
transverse beam position inside a probe, when signals are 
picked up from individual connectors.  

For an off-axis beam, the signal phases from individual 
electrodes can differ from those for a centered beam by a 
few degrees, while the phase of a summed signal remains 
the  same  within  the  computation  errors  (0.1-0.2°),  even 
for the beam offsets as large as the pipe half-aperture. It is 
illustrated by Fig. 3 (the error bars are shown only for the 
summed  signal).  In  the  capacitive  probe,  the  phase 
deviations  from  the  centered  beam  phase  grow  as  the 
beam  offset  increases,  approaching  1  degree  difference 
for  large  (half-aperture)  offsets  at  the  frequency  402.5 
MHz.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  analysis  [2],  we  have 
chosen the BPMs with summed signals from all electrodes 
as the beam phase detectors in the SNS linac.

3  BPPM IN DTL 

We  consider  the  tightest  spot,  the  third  DT  in the 2nd 
DTL tank. The DT length along the beam is about 8 cm 
and  its  beam-pipe  inner  radius  is  12.5  mm.  The  pickup 
design  with  four  60°  electrodes  is  similar  to  that  in  the 
CCL, we only reduce the transverse dimensions and take 
the  electrode  length  to  be  32  mm.  The  beam-induced 
signals  at  the  pickup  electrodes  are  computed  using 
MAFIA  simulations  with  an  ultra  relativistic  beam.  The 
Fourier  harmonics  amplitudes  for  the  on-axis  beam  are 
Ã1=0.190  V  at  402.5  MHz  and  Ã2=0.356 V at 805 MHz. 
We extrapolate these β=1 results to the H--beam energy of 
7.5 MeV (β1=0.126) analytically as described in Sect. 2.3. 
For the first harmonics, the ratio S(β1)/S(1)=0.80 results in 
the  beam-induced  signal  amplitude  0.152  V  at 7.5 MeV. 
For 805 MHz, the ratio S(β1)/S(1)=0.455 gives the signal 
amplitude  0.162  V.  We  want  to  compare  these  numbers 
with the signal amplitudes induced by the RF field in the 
DTL BPPM. 

To calculate the signal power on the BPPM electrodes 
induced by the 402.5-MHz RF field in the DTL tank, we 
put the DT with the BPPM inside in a cylindrical pillbox 
having the length of 96 mm (twice that of DTL half-cell), 
and adjust the pill-pox radius to tune the frequency of its 
lowest axisymmetric mode to 402.5 MHz. Integrating the 
electric  field  of  the  computed  eigenmode  along  the 
electrode  connector  gives  Vcon,  and  along  the  beam  axis 
Vax. We calculate the scaling factor as the ratio of the on-
axis  voltage  given  by  SUPERFISH design computations, 
Vax-SF = 2.96·105 V, to Vax. Multiplying Vcon by this scaling 
factor  gives  the  RF-induced  voltage  amplitude  Vind.  The 
results  are  listed  in  Table 1  for  a  few  different  pickup 
positions  inside  the  DT.  Here  zc  is  the  longitudinal 
coordinate  of  the  BPPM  electrode  center  relative  to  the 
DT middle point, and zg is the same for the BPM annular 
gap  center.  Since  the  electrode  length  is  32  mm  and  the 
gap is 4 mm wide, we have zg - zc = 32/2 + 4/2 = 18 mm. 

 

*    The electrode center is at the DT center 
**  The gap center is at the DT center 
 
Obviously,  placing  the  BPPM  gap  near  the  DT  center 
reduces the RF-induced signal significantly. This is due to 
the  axial  symmetry  of  the  RF  field,  which  penetrates 
effectively only through the annular gap, but not through 
the  longitudinal  slots  between  the  electrodes.  For  the 
optimal  BPM  position  inside  the  DT,  the  RF-induced 
voltages have the same order of magnitude as the beam-
induced  ones:  0.22  V  versus  0.15  V  at  402.5  MHz,  and 
versus  0.16  V  at  805  MHz.  While  this  prevents  us  from 
processing  BPPM  signals  at  402.5  MHz,  we can be sure 
that  this  BPPM  inside  the  DT  can  operate  with  the  RF 
power on without damage to the cables or electronics, and 
the  filtering  out  the  402.5-MHz  signal  will  present  no 
problem for the BPM signal processing at 805 MHz. 

4  SUMMARY 

Electromagnetic  MAFIA  modeling  of  the  SNS  linac 
BPPMs has been performed. Based on the analysis results, 
an  optimal  pickup  design  with  4  one-end-shorted  60-
degree  electrodes  has  been  chosen.  It  provides  a  good 
linearity and sufficient signal power for both position and 
phase measurements, while satisfying the geometrical and 
mechanical  requirements,  see  in  [1,2].  The  feasibility  of 
using BPPMs in the SNS drift-tube linac is demonstrated.

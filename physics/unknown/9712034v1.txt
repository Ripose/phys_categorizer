Abstract

The Lie algebra of the classical group SU(2) is constructed from two quon
algebras for which the deformation parameter is a common root of unity. This
construction leads to (i) a (not very well-known) polar decomposition of the
generators J− and J+ of the SU(2) Lie algebra and to (ii) an alternative to
quantization scheme. The
the
key ideas for developing the Wigner-Racah algebra of the group SU(2) in the
J 2, Ur
scheme are given. In particular, some properties of the coupling and

1 Motivations and Introduction

In recent years, intermediate statistics and deformed statistics were the object of
considerable interest [1-19]. The use of deformed oscillator algebras proved to be
useful in parastatistics, anyonic statistics and deformed statistics.
In particular,
one- and two-parameter deformations of the Bose-Einstein statistics (more precisely,
deformations of the relevant second quantization formalism) were studied by several
authors [6-19]. A common characteristics of most of these studies is that it is
possible to obtain a Bose-Einstein condensation of a free gas of bosons in D = 2
and 3 dimensions. However, in D = 3 dimensions, the q-deformed Bose-Einstein
(B-E) temperature is generally greater than the classical (corresponding to q = 1)
B-E temperature. In the speciﬁc case of 4He super-ﬂuid in phase II, the usual q-
deformations, i.e., the `a la Biedenharn [20] and `a la Macfarlane [21] q-deformations,
yield the following inequality :

(TB−E)q6=1 > (TB−E)q=1 > (TB−E)exp

so that we do not gain anything when passing from q = 1 to q
= 1. On the other
hand, by using a `a la Rideau [22,23] deformation, it is feasible to lower the critical
temperature (TB−E)q6=1 due to the occurrence of a second parameter ν′
0 in addition to
the deformation parameter q. This result corresponds to the model M1 introduced
in ref.[19]. For this model, we can obtain couples (ν′
0, q) for which (TB−E)q6=1 is in
2.17 K. However, as a drawback,
agreement with the experimental value (TB−E)exp ∼
the model M1 depends on two parameters. Although it is possible to ﬁnd a physical
interpretation (in terms of the chemical potential) of the deformation parameter q,
there is up to now no satisfying interpretation of the phenomenological parameter
ν′
0.

The just mentioned diﬃculty to interpret the parameter ν′

0 was the starting point
of an investigation of alternative deformations of the second quantization formalism.
More speciﬁcally, we investigated the `a la Arik and Coon [24] deformation but in
the case where q is a root of unity. (In the original work by Arik and Coon, the
deformation parameter q is a real number : The reality of q ensures that the creation
and annihilation operators are connected via Hermitean conjugation.) Thus, we
arrived at the conclusion that it is necessary to simultaneously consider two quon
algebras Aq and A¯q in order to obtain a convenient framework for obtaining B-E
condensation of quons.

As a ﬁrst by-product, we were naturally left to the deﬁnition and study of op-
erators, referred to as k-fermion operators, that interpolate between boson and
fermion operators. These new operators arise through the consideration of two non-
commuting quon algebras Aq and A¯q for which q = exp(2πi/k) with k
N
.
}
The case k = 2 corresponds to fermions and the limiting case k
to bosons.
Generalized coherent states (connected to k-fermionic states) and super-coherent
states (involving a k-fermionic sector and a purely bosonic sector) were examined.
In addition, the operators in the k-fermionic algebra were used to ﬁnd realizations

of the Dirac quantum phase operator and of the W∞ Fairlie-Fletcher-Zachos algebra
[25]. All these matters were discussed in Bregenz (at the Symposium Symmetries
in Science X), Dubna (at the VIII International Conference on Symmetry Methods
in Physics) and Istanbul (at the International Workshop Quantum Groups, Defor-
mations and Contractions) and shall be reported elsewhere [26,27].

In the present paper, we would like to deal with a second by-product of our quon
approach. Here, instead of considering two non-commuting quon algebras Aq and
A¯q, we shall consider two realizations of two commuting quon algebras corresponding
to the same root of unity q = exp(2πi/k) with k
. We shall see how to
construct (in Section 2) the Lie algebra of SU(2) from these two quon algebras ; how
to obtain (in Section 3) an alternative to the
scheme of SU(2) ; and how
to develop (in Section 4) the Wigner-Racah algebra of SU(2) in this new scheme.
In a last section (Section 5), we shall indicate some perspectives and brieﬂy discuss
some open problems.

which correspond to the Lie algebra of the group SU(2). As a result, the non-
deformed Lie algebra su(2) is obtained from two q-deformed oscillator algebras.

To close this section, it is interesting to note that we can generate the inﬁnite
dimensional Lie algebra W∞ from the generators of A1 and A2. Indeed, by putting

Equation (9) shows that the operators Tℓ span the algebra W∞ introduced by Fairlie,
Fletcher and Zachos [25]. This result parallels a similar result obtained in ref.[26] in
the study of k-fermions and of the Dirac quantum phase operator.

3 A New Basis for SU(2)

At this stage, it is important to establish a link with the work by L´evy-Leblond [28].
The decomposition (7), in terms of H and Ur, coincides with the polar decomposi-
tion, described in ref.[28], of the shift operators J+ and J− of the Lie algebra su(2).
This is easily seen by taking the matrix elements of Ur and H and by comparing
JT ;
these elements to the ones of the operators Υ and JT in [28]. This yields H
furthermore, by identifying the arbitrary phase ϕ of [28] to φr = 2πjr = π(k
1)r,
we obtain that Ur turns out to be identical to the operator Υ of [28]. Equation (7)
constitutes an important original result of ref.[28].
It is easy to prove that the Casimir operator

R. The case r = 1 probably
exists an inﬁnity of Br bases due to the fact that r
deserves a special attention. We shall give elsewhere a complete development of the
Wigner-Racah algebra of SU(2) in the B1 basis. In particular, the calculation and
the properties, including Regge symmetry properties, of the coupling coeﬃcients
( ¯f1 and f1 symbols and CGc’s in the
scheme) shall be the object of a
forthcoming paper.

As a further interesting step, it would be interesting to ﬁnd realizations of the
Br basis (i) on the sphere S2 for j integer and (ii) on the Fock-Bargmann spaces
(of entire analytical functions) in 1 and 2 dimensions for j integer or half of an
odd integer. In this respect, the problem of ﬁnding a diﬀerential realization of the
operator Ur on S2 and of expressing its eigenfunctions

One of the authors (M.K.) wishes to thank Jean-Marc L´evy-Leblond (from the
Universit´e Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France) for attracting his attention on ref.[28]
sixteen years ago. He also wishes to thank Jacob Katriel (from the Israel Institute of
Technology, Haifa, Israel) for discussions which contributed to clarify the question
of the spectrum of the operator Ur=0 eight years ago. Finally, he would like to
thank the organizing committee of the International Workshop Quantum Groups,
Deformations and Contractions for inviting him to give a talk from which the present
paper is a by-product.

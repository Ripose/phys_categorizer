It is shown that the gravity above a box filled with gas at ultra-low pressure can be reduced 
when  an  electromagnetic  field  is  applied  through  the  gas.  The  gravity  decrease  is 
proportional  to  the  intensity  of  the  electromagnetic  field,  and  inversely  proportional  to  the 
mass density of the gas.  From the technical point of view, there are several applications for 
this discovery; possibly it will change the paradigms of energy generation, transportation and 
telecommunications.

I. INTRODUCTION        
 
         It  will  be  shown  that  the  local 
gravity acceleration can be controlled by 
means of a device called Gravity Control 
Cell (GCC) which basically is a box filled 
with  gas  at  ultra-low  pressure  where  an 
electromagnetic  field  is  applied  through 
is 
the  gas.  The  gravity  decrease

to 
          With  a  GCC 
convert 
into 
rotational  mechanical  energy  by  means 
of  the  Gravitational  Motor.  In  addition,  a 
new 
(the 
Gravitational  Spacecraft)  and  aerospace 
flight  is  presented  here  based  on  the 
possibility of gravity control. We will also 
see  that  the  gravity  control  will  be  very 
important to Telecommunication. 
 
 II. THEORY 
                    
          It was shown that the gravitational

          For  example,  we  can  look  on  the 
pΔ     as  due  to 
momentum  variation 
absorption or emission of electromagnetic 
energy by the particle.  
          In the case of   radiation,  pΔ  can be 
obtained  as  follows:  It  is  known  that  the 
radiation  pressure, dP ,  upon  an  area 
  of

          Therefore  the  box  filled  with  air  at 
ultra-low  pressure  works  such  as  a 
Gravity  Control  Cell  (GCC).  Note  that 
below  and  above  the  air  are  the  bottom 
and  the  top  of  the  box.  Therefore  the 
choice of the material of the box is highly 
relevant.  If  the  box  is  made  of  steel,  for 
example,  and  the  gravity  acceleration 
below the box is  g  then at the bottom of

          According  to  the  new  expression 
,  we 
for  the  inertial  forces  [1], 
see    that  these  forces  have  origin  in  the 
interaction  between  a 
gravitational 
particle  and  the  others  of  the  Universe, 
just as  Mach’s principle predicts. Hence 
mentioned  expression  incorporates  the 
Mach’s  principle  into  Gravitation  Theory, 
and  furthermore  reveals  that  the  inertial 
effects  upon  a  body  can  be  strongly 
reduced  by  means  of  the  decreasing  of 
its gravitational mass.

          Consequently,  we  conclude  that  if 
the 
the  gravitational 
spacecraft  are  reduced  from  109  times 
then  also  the  inertial  forces  upon  the 
spacecraft will be reduced from 109 times

Consequently  it  is  easy  to  see  that  this 
system  is  ideal  to  yield  artificial  gravity 
inside the spacecraft in the case of inter-
gravity 
stellar 
acceleration  out  of  the  spacecraft  -  due 
to the Universe - becomes negligible.  
          The  vertical  displacement  of  the 
spacecraft can be produced by means of 
Gravitational  Thrusters.  A  schematic 
diagram  of  a  Gravitational  Thruster  is 
in  Fig.4.  The  Gravitational 
shown 
Thrusters can also provide the horizontal 
displacement of the spacecraft.  
          The  concept  of  Gravitational 
Thruster  results  from  the  theory  of  the 
Gravity Control Battery, showed in Fig. 1 
(b).  Note 
the  number  of  GCC 
increases  the  thrust  of  the  thruster.  For 
example,  if  the  thruster  has  three  GCCs 
then  the  gravity  acceleration  upon  the 
gas  sprayed  inside  the  thruster  will  be

These  forces  are  much  more  intense 
than  the  inter-atomic  forces  (the  forces 
which  maintain 
joined  atoms,  and 
molecules  that  make  the  solids  and 
liquids)  whose  intensities,  according  to 
the  Coulomb’s  law,  is  of  the  order  of             
1-1000×10-8N. 
          Consequently,  the  air  around  the 
spacecraft  will  be  strongly  compressed 
upon  their  surface,  making  an  “air  shell” 
that  will  accompany 
the  spacecraft 
during  its  displacement  and  will  protect 

shell  with 

 
the  aluminum  shell  of  the  direct  attrition 
with the Earth’s atmosphere. 
          In  this  way,  during  the  flight,  the 
attrition would occur just between the “air 
shell”  and  the  atmospheric  air  around 
her. Thus, the spacecraft would stay free 
of  the  thermal  effects  that  would  be 
produced  by  the  direct  attrition  of  the 
aluminum 
the  Earth’s 
atmosphere. 
         Another interesting effect produced

          Apparently,  Newton’s  theory  of 
gravity  had  no  gravitational  waves 
because,  if  a  gravitational  field  changed 
in  some  way,  that  change  took  place 
instantaneously  everywhere  in  space, 
and  one  can  think  that  there  is  not  a 
wave  in  this  case.  However,  we  have 
the  gravitational 
already  seen 
interaction  can  be  repulsive,  besides 
attractive.  Thus,  as  with  electromagnetic 
interaction,  the  gravitational  interaction 
must  be  produced  by  the  exchange  of 
"virtual"  quanta  of  spin  1  and  mass  null, 
i.e., 
the  gravitational  "virtual"  quanta 
(graviphoton)  must  have  spin  1  and  not 
2. Consequently, the fact of a change in 
a 
reach 
field 
instantaneously  everywhere 
in  space 
occurs  simply  due  to  the  speed  of  the 
graviphoton to be infinite. It is known that

waves  are  ripples  in  the  space-time 
generated by gravitational field changes. 
According  to  Einstein’s  theory  of  gravity 
the  velocity  of  propagation  of  these 
waves is equal to the speed of light (c).   
          Unlike  the  electromagnetic  waves 
the  real  gravitational  waves  have  low 
interaction with matter and consequently

However,  when  the  distance  between 
transmitter   and   receiver    is too large, 
for example of the order of magnitude of 
several  light-years,  the  transmission  of 
information  by  means  of  gravitational 
waves becomes impracticable due to the 
the 
long 
information.  On  the  other  hand,  there  is 
no  delay  during  the  transmissions  by 
means of virtual gravitational radiation. In

addition  the      scattering  of  this  radiation 
is  null.  Therefore  the  virtual  gravitational 
radiation  is  very  suitable  as  a  means  of 
transmitting information at any distances 
including astronomical distances.            
                 As  concerns  detection  of  the 
virtual  gravitational  radiation  from  GCC 
antenna, there are many options. Due to 
Resonance  Principle  a  similar  GCC 
antenna  (receiver)  tuned  at  the  same 
frequency  can  absorb  energy  from  an 
radiation 
incident  virtual  gravitational 
(See  Fig.8

gravitational  mass  of  the  air  inside  the 
GCC  receiver  will  vary  such  as  the 
gravitational  mass  of  the  air  inside  the 
GCC

magnetic  field  similar  to  the  magnetic 
transmitter  and 
field  of 
therefore  the  current  through  the  coil 
inside  the  GCC  receiver  will  have  the 
same  characteristics  of 
the  current 
the  GCC 
through 
transmitter.  However,  the  volume  and 
pressure  of  the  air  inside  the  two  GCCs 
must  be  exactly  the  same;  also  the  type 
and the quantity of atoms in the air inside 
the two GCCs must be exactly the same. 
Thus,  the  GCC  antennas  are  simple  but 
they are not easy to build. 
          Note that a GCC antenna radiates 
graviphotons  and  gravitational  waves 
simultaneously  (Fig.  8  (a)).  Thus,  it  is    
not only   a   gravitational antenna: it is a 
Quantum Gravitational Antenna because 
it  can  also  emit  and  detect  gravitational 
"virtual"  quanta  (graviphotons),  which,  in 
turn, 
information 
transmit 
instantaneously from any distance in the 
Universe without scattering.  
          Due  to  the  difficulty  to  build  two 
similar  GCC  antennas  and,  considering 
that  the  electric  current  in  the  receiver 
antenna  can  be  detectable  even  if  the 
gravitational  mass  of  the  nuclei  of  the 
antennas  are  not  strongly  reduced,  then 
we  propose  to  replace  the  gas  at  the 
nuclei of the antennas by a thin dielectric 
lamina. The dielectric lamina with exactly 
108  atoms  (103atoms  ×  103atoms  × 
102atoms)  is  placed  between  the  plates

possible  to  build  two  similar  antennas 
whose  nuclei  have  the  same  volumes 
and  the  same  types  and  quantities  of 
atoms.  
          Note 
Quantum 
Gravitational Antennas can also be used 
to  transmit  electric  power.  It  is  easy  to 
see  that  the  Transmitter  and  Receiver 
(Fig. 9(a)) can work with strong voltages 
and  electric  currents.  This  means  that 
strong  electric  power  can  be  transmitted 
among Quantum Gravitational Antennas. 
This  obviously  solves  the  problem  of 
wireless electric power transmission.  
           
  
 IV.CONCLUSION 
 
        The  process  described  here 
is 
clearly  the  better  way  in  order  to  control 
the  gravity.  This  is  because  the  Gravity 
Control  Cell  in  this  case  is  very  easy  to 
be  built,  the  cost  is  low  and  it  works  at 
ambient 
temperature.  The  Gravity 
Control  is  the  starting  point  for  the 
generation  of  and  detection  of  Virtual 
Gravitational 
(Quantum 
Gravitational  Transceiver)  also  for  the 
construction  of  the  Gravitational  Motor 
and  the  Gravitational  Spacecraft  which 
includes  the  system  for  generation  of 
artificial  gravity  presented  in  Fig.3  and 
the  Gravitational  Thruster  (Fig.4).    While 
the  Gravitational  Transceiver  leads  to  a 
new  concept  in  Telecommunication,  the 
the 
Gravitational  Motor 
paradigm  of  energy  conversion  and  the 
Gravitational  Spacecraft  points  to  a  new 
concept in aerospace flight.

Optical Doppler shift demonstration experiments are not a simple task since the light

source cannot usually be moved in a sufficiently smooth and uniform manner to keep

the level of noise well below of that of the signal. For that reason most demonstration

experiments are usually performed with sound or with microwaves.

Previous work have been reported using a moving mirror in order to produce a

moving light source, but small perturbation of its trajectory, as small as the optical

wavelength, can produce a large noise.

Using a rotating mirror, in which one beam is reflected from the advancing side and

the other beam is reflected from the receding part of a rotating mirror, can overcome

many of the noise generating effects.

In the present work we report the construction and operation of a demonstration

apparatus for measuring optical Doppler shift based on a rotating mirror.

Introduction

Experiments on mechanical and electromagnetic wave propagation are usually

conducted in elementary, introductory physics courses. Many teaching kits are readily

available on the market covering most of the key experiments. Notwithstanding this

fact neither those kits nor simple teaching experiments on optical Doppler shift are

easily found.

Although the Doppler shift is a well-understood effect that is usually introduced to

undergraduate physics students in elementary courses, its demonstration using light is

not a simple matter. Doppler shift demonstration experiments for undergraduates are

usually performed with sound or with microwaves.

Using light is not a simple task since the moving mirror from which light is reflected

cannot usually be moved in a sufficiently smooth and uniform manner to keep the

level of noise below that of the signal. Small perturbations as small as the optical

wavelength can produce a non-negligible noise.

Previous undergraduate demonstrations of the optical Doppler shift have involved the

use of Michelson interferometers with arms of approximately equal path lengths using

air-track glider1 or a servo-mounted mirror on an isolated optics table2; light reflection

from Scotchlite tape on a rotating turntable with a spectrum analyzer3; and direct

frequency modulation produced by a HO scale model train engine4. Velocities up to

0.3 m/s were used, thus Doppler beat frequencies were below 1 MHz..

Before describing the experimental setup and results, we want to mention how the

demonstration is developed in the lab. Actually our demonstration is divided into two

parts. The first part deals with wave superposition, where students can verify the

superposition law using ultrasound waves.

After the completion of the first part, the optical Doppler shift apparatus is introduced,

which students can use to measure the Doppler shift as a function of the rotating

Therefore the first part is devoted to the background knowledge on wave

frequency of the mirror.

A first experiment was conducted in order to test the validity of Eq. (4). Two

ultrasound emitters powered by two different wave generators working at different

frequencies were place in front of a receiver. Measuring at a fixed position the time

dependence of (4) shows a high frequency pattern (at mean frequency ω) modulated

by a low frequency pattern (at difference frequency  ω∆ ). The idea of this first

experiment is that the students acquire a physical insight of (4) as they can test

different amplitudes, frequencies and even different spatial positions.

Superposition of two optical waves

Light frequencies are around 500 THz, well beyond the frequency resolution of light

detectors. Therefore, the measured intensity fluctuation is the temporal mean value of

(4) over a time span related to the detector time response, always much larger than the

period of the light wave.

In order to evaluate the measured intensity I the mean value of the square of the

optical perturbation, is calculated as

Let v be the velocity of a mirror (positive towards the source) in uniform motion,

normal to its plane, c the velocity of light which makes the angle of incidence α with

the mirror, then the frequency of the reflected beam, to first order in

Actually, this relation follows simply from the consideration that the image of the

source moves with the velocity

 in the direction of the normal to the mirror.

For a rotating mirror, at any time the same formula (14) can be used if the

instantaneous velocity of the reflecting surface is used in place of v 6.

Under the above assumptions, the frequency of a reflected beam at a distance R from

the axis of a rotating mirror (having angular frequency  Ω ) will be

where the sign will be positive in the side where the mirror approaches to the source

and negative when recedes from the source.

Note that the beat frequency (19) depends on beam separation rather than the radial

position where the beams hit the mirror. The same frequency will be obtained if, for

example, both beams are at equal distance R from the center or one beam hits the

mirror at the center an the other at distance 2R. That is, only beam separation counts.

Further, the beat frequency does not depend on the angle of incidence either. If the

angle of incidence of the two beams is larger, then the beam separation at the mirror

surface will be larger by the same factor as the reduction of the normal velocity. Thus

the angle of incidence cancels off the equation.

Therefore the measurement is almost insensitive to perturbations to the mirror

movement. Almost any standard grade rotating tool will be sufficient to obtain a good

measurement of the optical Doppler shift. This is a clear advantage over translating

movements were beams are not self compensated.

Experimental setup

A block diagram of the apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. The light source is a low-power

green He-Ne laser. A beam splitter separates the beam, part is reflected from the

approaching side of a rotating mirror; part is reflected from the receding part of a

rotating mirror. They are recombined by a beam splitter and measured by a photo-

multiplier tube. Beat between the two beams produces fluctuations in the light

intensity at the photo-cathode. The photocurrent is proportional to the light intensity

and contains fluctuations due to the Doppler shift of the reflected beam from the

rotating mirror.

The laser was a Melles Griot model 05-LGR-025. The laser beam was used with no

lenses. The unmodified laser beam is easy to position and to control directionally.

Although not needed for demonstration purposes, an optional spatial filter was

designed to be placed at the laser output.

The rotating mirror was handcrafted by one of the authors on a cube (20 mm side) of

Cobalt-Steel. A low cost ($20), high-speed (up to 30,000 rpm) rotary tool was used to

drive the rotating mirror. A special support was constructed to hold the rotatory tool.

Beam-splitters and mirror were from standard optical Melles-Griot kits.

Special positioners were built in order to place mirror and beamsplitter close enough

to produce a 17 mm beam separation or recombination.

For detecting the beat frequency a Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier powered by a

2KV, 2mA power supply, was used. The electrical signal was recorded in a 100 MHz,

500 MSa/s Tektronik TDS 320 digitizer. Photomultiplier cage was made of

A photodiode connected to a low-frequency meter was used for measuring the

of the mirror was varied from 10 to 200 Hz. Fig. 3 shows the temporal variation of

The measurements proceeded as follows. Using a variable transformer the speed of

the rotating mirror was varied from 10 to 200 Hz. At approximately 10 Hz interval the

photomultiplier signal was saved to the computer together with the photodiode

measure of the mirror frequency. A Fast Fourier Transform was applied to each signal

and the peak frequency was recorded. A plot of the peak frequency as a function of

the rotating frequency was constructed.

In Fig. 4 we plot the measured beat frequency as a function of the rotating mirror

frequency. Also the theoretical values are plotted with dotted line. The agreement is

excellent. All experimental values agree to the theoretical values within the error

limits.

Discussion

The beat frequency difference between the Doppler shifted light from a rotating

mirror was observed for different rotational frequency. Using a low precision rotatory

tool very good results can be obtained.

All components that were used are commonly available items. The techniques

described in this paper provide a quantitative demonstration of the Doppler effect of

light and overcome the usual problems caused by motional instabilities associated

with the moving mirror, since the frequency shift depends on beam separation rather

than radial position or axial displacement.

Velocities of the moving mirror were up to 10 m/s, that is more than one order of

magnitude larger than in previous work. This allows an optical beat frequency up to

80 MHz in a 1 µs pulse length (see Fig. 3). This pulse can be used to perform other

demonstration measurements including the speed of light without needing special

extra equipment since wavelength are expected to be from 4 to 15 meters.

An interesting feature of our approach is that neither sophisticated optical nor

electronics is needed. Only a relatively fast digitizer is needed having 100 MHz and

500 KSample/s. The main items required are a low-powered laser, mirrors, optical and

detector. These items are available in most universities and colleges.

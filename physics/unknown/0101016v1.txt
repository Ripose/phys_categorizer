Whether the space-time is curved or not? The experimental criterion to judge this point 
are: (1) The experimental results of red shift, deflective angle of light and perihelion shift of 
planet  in  essence  are  favorable  to  the  gravitational  theory  based  on  flat  space  time,  but 
unfavorable to the general relativity. (2) In Gravity Probe-B experiment, if the experimental 
value of angular acceleration of gyroscope of orbital (geodetic) effect is   

and  the  experimental  value  of  angular  acceleration  of  the  earth  rotation  (frame-dragging) 
effect projected in the equatorial plane is   

then  the  space  time  is  flat.  If  the  experimental  values  of  these  two  angular  accelerations  of 
gyroscope are

  Is  space-time  curved?  If  we  want  to  answer  this  question,  we  must  clarify  the 
experimental criterion to judge whether the space-time is flat. However Newton gravity is not 
a formula that it satisfies the demand of covariance of special relativity. Therefore its results 
cannot  be  used  to  represent  the  character  of  flat  space-time.  If  there  is  a  new  gravitational 
theory,  that  it  set  up  based  on  the  flat  space-time  and  satisfies  the  covariance  of  special 
relativity. Then we can deduce the experimental criterion of flat space-time from this theory.   
        In  our  previous  work
, we set up a new theory–special relativistic gravitational theory. 
Now let us compare the mathematical construction of special relativistic gravitational theory 
with general relativity, both are set up based on different space-time. Therefore we can learn 
how to judge whether space-time  flat.

        As  discussed  in  our  previous  studies,  the  first  hypothesis  of  special  relativistic 
gravitational  theory  is  the  equivalence  of  inertial  mass  and  gravitational  mass.  Based  upon 
this hypothesis one would have the 4-dimensional gravitational force as follows

where 

sU   is  the  4-dimensional  velocity  of  the  exerted  body, 

nsrH   is  the  strength  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gravitational field. According to the special relativistic relation

It  is  important  that  the  fourth  term  of  Eq.(3)  is  perpendicular  to  u   from  Eq.(2).  The 
mathematical form of Eq. (1) is the same as the equation of general relativity 

where  symbols 

)(S , 

(G   are  used  to  distinguish  the  corresponding  quantities  in  special 

)

relativity  and  general  relativity.  Therefore,  the  question  focus  on  the  difference  between 

n
sr

  and 

nsrH . 

        From  Eq.  (2)  and  the  symmetry  of 

nsrH   for  s and  r , we can obtain

        The  first  term  of  Eq.  (3)  is  independent of 3-dimensional velocity (except  m  factor), so 
this  term  is  the  Newton  gravity.  From  Newton  gravitational  potential  and  the  covariance  of 
gravitational field equation under Lorentz transformation, we get that the only possible form 
of the gravitational field equation is

Newton  potential  is  the  summary  of  the  classical  gravitational  observation,  which  is  only 
related to weak field. Therefore, this equation is merely the linear approximation of the field 
equation. 
    In the weak field limit, the metric tensor of general relativity is in the form

Because  the  right  side  of  Eq.  (11)  contains  a  G   factor, 

  may  only  take  the  zeroth 

order  approximation.  Under  such  circumstance,  we  have 

,(

approximation, the equation of

If all of the 

nsrN  terms are zero, the dynamic equation of general relativity will become the 

corresponding equation in special relativistic theory. Therefore, the main focus of the problem 

becomes whether we can verify that all the 

nsrN terms are zero from experiment.

This is also in agreement with the experimental observation. The red shift experiment directly 
proves  that  the  additional  gravity  is  not  to  do  work,  the  conclusion  of  flat  space-time  is 
correct.

The factor 2 is extremely important. We rewrite the general relativity equation in forms of Eqs.

In  general,  people  believe  that  three  classical  relativistic  experiments  support  (original) 
general  relativity.  This  only  means  that:  the  perihelion  shift  of  the  planet  and  the  deflective 
angle of light deduced from Eqs. (42), (43), and the frequency red shift deduced from metrical 
tensor  are  identical  with  the  observations.  However  these  are  incomplete  because  from  the 
 and the experimental value of frequency red shift, the variance of energy is

Eq.  (42)  deduced  from  (original)  general  relativity  is  in  contradiction  to  the  experimental 
value by a factor 2. So the exact statement is that (original) general relativity only obtains the 
support  of  two  and  a  half  experiments.  Caused  by  this  fundamental  contradiction,  many 
people are trying to come up with new theories or corrections. All these new theories will be 
tested by the new experiment, especially by experiments like Gravity Probe-B. 
        The  rational  deduction  should  be: 

l  The variance energy in red shift experiment points out that the factor 2 in Eq. (42) is 
not  correct.  This  fact  means  that  non-Newton  term  does  not  contribute  to  the 

variance energy. The experimental value of 

jN   must  be  zero. 

)

(
e
44

l  There is no reason to believe that Eq. (42) is still correct in other experiments, e.g. 
the deflection of light. General relativity explains the perihelion shift of the planet 
and the deflective angle of light, but its validity is doubtful because the correctness 
of Eq. (42) needs to be justified. 

l  If we delete the factor 2, then Eq. (42) becomes Eq. (26). In this case, if we want to 
obtain the experimental values of perihelion shift of planet and deflection angle of 
light in the static source problem. The only way is to combine Eq. (26) with Eq. (27). 

It  means  that  the  experimental  value  of 

)( e

ijlN   must  be  zero.  So  all  experimental 

values 

)

( eNnsr  are zero in the static source problem. 

Are  the  above  interpretations  correct?  They  can  be  tested  by  GP-B experiment. If the 
then  the  above 

experimental value of orbital (geodetic) effect precession rate is 4.4 
inferences is correct.

When  the  source  is  moving,  the  components  of  field  due  to  this  source  are

.  Both  gravitational  theories  predict  that  the  gravity  contains  the  terms,  which  are 

linear  relative  to  3-dimensional  velocity  of  the  exerted  body  (except  m factor). The second

and third terms of Eq. (3) are proportional to

of these two terms is much smaller than that of the Newton term. The best way to test whether 
these two terms exist in experiment is to put a rotating gyroscope in the gravitational field and 
to  measure  its  precession  rate.  In  this  case,  the  Newton  term  does  not  contribute  to  the 
precession  rate  of  the  gyroscope,  therefore  people  can  measure  the  size  of  the  term  linear 
relative to 3-dimensional velocity. Of cause, the precession rate is very small. If people want 
to obtain reliable results, the measurement must be very accurate which is extremely difficult.

NASA  and  Stanford  University  are  planning  to  “testing  Einstein  with  orbiting 
gyroscopes — gravity probe B”. In this experiment, four spinning gyroscopes will be set up in 
an  orbiting  satellite  around  the  earth.  When  the  satellite  is  in  the  orbital  motion,  from  the 
satellite  instantaneous  rest-frame,  the  earth  is  moving  around  the  satellite.  Also  the  earth 

revolves  around  its  axis  of  rotation.  The  spinning  gyroscope  is  used  to  probe  B   and  ˆ

 

components of gravitational field due to these two types motion of the earth. To distinguish 

two types of field, let us use the symbol 

LB ,

L

  to  represent  the  component  of  field due to 

the  motion  of  the  earth  around  the  satellite,  and  use 

d L /w

dt

  to  represent  the  angular 

acceleration  caused  by  these  components  of  field  and  simply  call  it  as  orbital  effect. 

Symbolize 

SB , 

S

 as the components of field due to the earth revolve around its rotation 

axis, and 

d S /w

 to represent the angular acceleration caused by these components of field, 

and simply call it as earth rotation effect. 

 
(3-1) The orbital (geodetic) effect 
 
In the earth frame, the center of the earth is static. The gravitational potential due to the 
static  sphere  is  Eq.  (22).  Using  the  Lorentz  transformation,  we  can  get  the  gravitational 
potential observed on the satellite instantaneous static frame and finally obtain:

This formula is the same as that given by Schiff,L.I. (1960) which determines  the    geodetic 
precession  rate  predicted  by  general  relativity.  GP-B  group  pointed  out  that  the  geodetic 
precession  rate  is  6.6 
then  the  orbital  effect  precession  rate  predicted  by  special 
relativistic gravitational theory will be 4.4   

In  the  above  discussion,  we  take  two  fundamental  hypotheses  of  special  relativistic 
gravitational theory as the premise to deduce the precession rate of orbital effect. However, 
there  are  other  ways  to  calculate  the  precession  rate.  Taking  the  results  of  three  classical 
relativistic  experiments  as  the  premise,  we  can  find  out  the  formula  of  gravity  and  all 
component of strength field due to a static sphere. Using the Lorentz’s transformation, we can 
obtain  the  component  of  strength  field  due  to  a  moving  sphere.  Then  we  can  calculate the 
precession  rate  of  orbital  (geodetic)  effect.  The  final  result  is  the  same  as  Eq.  (51).  So  it  is 
extremely likely that people obtain the value of precession rate of orbital effect predicated by 
special  relativistic  gravitational  theory  from  GP-B experiment.  If  the  experimental  value  of 
precession  rate  of  orbital  effect  approaches  4.4 

this fact will prove that our   

 

inference for three classical relativistic experiments is correct.

theory is correct from the experiment’s value. The most robust case would be if we set one

  plane (

), and another gyroscope its 

revolving  direction  is  in

  plane  (

2/pj =

).  By  comparing  the  procession  rates,  we 

can  not  only  judge  which  gravitational  theory  is  correct,  but  also  determine  the rate of two 

contributions of  B   and  ˆ

  terms. 

        As  we  discussed  earlier  that  Eq.  (8)  is  a  linear  approximation.  In  the  case  of  weak  field, 
the  gravitational  radiation  effects  are  weak.  We  can  only  observe  gravitational  radiation 
effects  in  the  motion  of  extra  dense  body,  such  as  a  supernova.  In  this  case  we  must  use  a 
nonlinear  field  equation  to  substitute  Eq.  (8).  We  shall  discuss  this  problem  in  a  separate 
paper.

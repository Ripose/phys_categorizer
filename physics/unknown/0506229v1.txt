The Age-Competency Model to the Study of the Age-Wage Profiles for 
Workers 

Our main need is neither food, nor money. It is education.

In this article, I present a new approach and a novel model to the study of the life cycle of 
wages. The key idea is that wage can be thought of as remuneration paid for the competency. 
It is assumed with the approach that there are three  main  mechanisms acting at micro level 
and  resulting  in  the  change  of  workers’  competencies  during  their  lives.  These  are  an 
endogenous growth of workers’ initial competencies; a rate of investment in schooling in the 
life cycle of wages; and an effect of relative losses in workers’ competencies. The developed 
macro model is to shed light on the processes resulting in the age-wage profiles seen in mass. 
The model obeys a nonlinear integro-differential equation. The found analytic solution of the 
equation  has  the  form  of  Fisk  PDF  of  a  special  type.  The  solution  and  its  features  are 
discussed. The regression technique is used to check the model upon reliability. The model 
provides better fitting to the data (Elo & Salonen, 2004) than minceranian earnings function 
(Mincer, 1974) does. 

 

Introduction 
 

The study of the effects of investment in schooling and on-the-job training on the level, pattern 
and interpersonal distribution of life-cycle earnings have been pioneered by Becker (1962, 1964, 
1965, 1966) and Mincer (1958, 1962, 1974). This leads to one of the most successful empirical 
equation called the “Mincer (1974) earnings function” 

ln(

rS
where w is earnings (or the hourly wage when available), S is years of schooling, E is years of 
labor market experience, and ε is an error term. Years of schooling are a fairly direct measure of 
educational human capital, while years of labor market experience are viewed as a proxy for on-
the-job training.

Almost  all  empirical  studies  find  that  schooling  has  a  positive  and  significant  effect  on 
1 >β and 
 ), these earnings are a concave function of labor market experience (
0

0>r

 ). The Mincer equation thus captures the important empirical regularities: 
1) increase in earnings with schooling, 
2) concavity of log earnings in experience, 
3) parallelism in log earnings experiences profiles for different educational groups (ratio 
of earnings for persons with education levels differing by a fixed number of years is 
roughly constant across schooling levels) 
4) U-shaped interpersonal variance in earnings. 

The  theoretical  foundations  of  Mincer  specification  can  arise  from  two  theoretical 

earnings (
0
2 <β

frameworks: 

i. compensating wage differentials (Mincer, 1958) 
ii. accounting identity framework (Mincer, 1974). 

Technically,  the  Mincer’s  approach  is  based  on  the  idea  of  allocation  of  non-leisure  time 
between working and schooling. Namely, to get the Mincer model it should be assumed that the 
workers  used  to  share  their  non-leisure  time  between  schooling  and  working.  Such  an 

assumption  looks  very  natural,  but  there  is  a  problem  how  to  separate  and  to  measure  these 
pieces of time, and especially in on-the-job training.      

The basic Mincer human capital earnings function does not appear to fit the data nearly as 

well in the 1980s and 1990s as it did in the 1960s and 1970s: 

1) Log wages are an increasingly convex function of years of schooling: that is, the log-
linearity in schooling seems to be held no longer. 
2) The quadratic in experience tends to understate earnings growth at the beginning of the 
lifecycle and overstate the decline in earnings towards the end of the lifecycle. Murphy 
and Welch (1990) find that a quartic fits the data better. 
3) Experience-wage profiles are no longer parallel for different educational groups: that 
is, the multiplicative separability between experience and schooling holds no longer. For 
example, the college-high school wage gap is now much larger for less experienced than 
for more experienced workers. 

It is very likely the investments in human capital, the workers in mass made in recent decades for 
their earnings to grow up, have had the determining effect on their wages.   
 
In this article, I present a model to explain the effect.  To build the model I have developed a 
novel  approach,  which  is  not  a  “clone”  of  Mincer’s;  the  approach  has  nothing  of  the  idea  of 
allocation of a non-leisure time between working and schooling.  

 

The framework of approach 
 
Worker’s competency is a key concept I apply to in my approach. The common meaning of noun 
“competency”  is  the  quality  of  human  being  adequately  and  well  qualified  physically  and 
intellectually  for  doing  a  certain  job.  Schooling  is  the  only  way  for  people  to  become  well 
qualified intellectually. It can be considered the law, which is acting in the world of education – 
the more schooling is taken, the more level of competency is gotten.  

I assume the workers’ competencies are the only goods they sell on the labor market.  This 
means  that  the  competencies  have  some  market  values,  and  wages  of  workers  are  “made”  of 
these. It is seen and can be considered the law, which is acting in the world of economy, that the 
higher level of competency brings as a rule the higher wages.  

Worker’s  competency  tends  to  vary.  Extra  schooling  and  on-the-job  training  boost  the 
worker’s competency. In my approach, I pre-assume an extra schooling is paid for; to get more 
level  of  competency  the  worker  invests  in  himself  some  part  of  the  personal  income.  Such 
pattern of economic behavior of workers looks quite natural; one can expect they in mass do so 
to have higher wages. It is quite natural to assume also that there is an endogenous growth of the 
workers’  competencies  as  a  result  of  inner  development  of  knowledge  and  professional  skills 
acquired  by  the  workers.  For  brevity,  I  call  this  process  “the  endogenous  growth  of  initial 
competency”.    The  workers’  competencies  tend  also  to  get  out-of-date  i.e.  to  go  down,  as  the 
workers  get  older.  Producing  of  new  knowledge  goes  on  constantly  in  the  modern  world;  this 
knowledge is used to provide schooling; those who just have finished schools enter labor market 
with this new knowledge. The old workers in mass know as a rule a little of that new and they 
cannot  become  younger  to  get  back  to  schooling  from  the  very  beginning.  Accumulating 
knowledge makes human less flexible in acquiring new knowledge. Such accumulating goes on 
during the life cycle of human so people become the “hostages” of that knowledge that they have 
acquired. I propose a novel model for that, namely I assume that the specific rate of change of 
current competency tends to diminish with time-averaged accumulating competency. Formally, 
in my approach, this model is a substitute for that part of modeling in the field of economic of 
education  that  is  known  as  the  problem  of  overlapping  generations.  For  short,  the  process  of 
relative loosing of the worker’s competency I term as “competency damping”.

Here, in (14) the term in the figured brackets has the standard form of Fisk PDF (McLaughlin, 
2001) but of specific kind. (Note that  Q  depends on  P  in this case (see formulas (6a), (6b)). 

Thus,  the  solution  of  nonlinear  Eq.  (5)  obeys  Fisk  PDF  of  specific  kind  (14).  This  is  an 
important result of my study. Up to now, researchers look upon Fisk PDF as function, which is a 
suitable one for income data fitting. Now, relying on the model, Fisk PDF can be very naturally 
used for that.

I  call  Eq.  (16)  the  age-competency  master-equation.  It  “rules”  the  processes  having  been 
discussed in the framework of my approach. 

1=t

In the light of the approach, the coefficient at the second term in the right-hand side of Eq. 
(16) appears to be very natural; endogenous growth’s trajectory of initial competency “starts” at 
some  “right”  angle  at 
  holds,  the  starting  slope  of  the 
  is  very  close  to  the  slope  of  overall  solution’s  curve.  The 
endogenous  growth’s  curve  at 
condition means simply that the overall solution’s trajectory will keep going for a while closely 
with the trajectory, which is predetermined by the schooling taken at school. Thus, the solution’s 
analytic  continuation  is  possible  back  in  the  times  when  the  persons  were  studying  at  schools. 
This is one more important result in my study.

(Compare this to (weak) Pareto law!). I present this formal result here just to stress that (14) and, 
therefore, (8) make an economic sense.   

It  was  found  by  many  that  the  age-wage  profiles  are  usually  bell-shaped  and  positively 
skewed.  Weak  Pareto  law  approximates  quite  well  those  fattened  right  tails  seen  in  age-wage 
profiles (Krämer & Ziebach, 2003). Therefore, to have better results many of researchers apply 
two laws in data fitting.  In the very beginning and in the middle of ranges of age-wage profiles 
they  apply  some  bell-shaped  PDF,  say  BETA-family,  and  then  Pareto  PDF.  The  problem  is 
persisting in how to mate smoothly these two. The law (14) draws out both bell-shaped region 
and fattened right tail of the curve. It is the third important result of the study.

                    (α=0.0036, β=1.5, Z(1)=0.0, Z’(1)=0.87: A=-0.007, P=1.87, Q=-969.4) 

 
Such effect (some extra peak at the end of the life cycle of wages) has been seen in the studies 
(see also in Fig. A1 – A13 in the Appendix). Opinions differ widely on why it is so. Having in 
mind  formula  (24),  it  might  be  explained  by  an  overinvestment  in  schooling;  one  can  expect 
there is a (small) cohort of workers of senior ages who do invest in schooling by this strategy. 
Such pattern of behavior of the cohort should be argued. My explanation is that some intelligent 
workers risk doing so as they wish to win economic contest with others. Moreover, if the wages 
are high in a senior age and the worker’s wellbeing is high, extra schooling or self-education is 
among few attractive sectors for investing money. At the end of life cycle of wages, workers in 
mass being parents decide as a rule to invest money in further schooling of children; those who 
make  alternative  decision  (e.g.,  the  family  have  no  children)  might  go  on  investing  in 
themselves.  Those  extremely  high  levels  of  wages  (incomes)  predicted  by  Eq.  (24)  (at  a 
) but not seen in the age-wage profiles are most likely to be suppressed 
neighborhood of

by market mechanisms. It might be the same in the case of varying the coefficients in Eq. (1) in 
the  life  cycle  of  wages.  The  problem  of  varying  coefficients  in  Eq.  (1)  will  be  discussed  in 
forthcoming article.              
      

The analysis and experimental proof for the model

where δ (starting wage) and γ in Eqs. (25), (26) are unknown parameters (of linear regression). 
(Actually, starting wages can be eliminated in data samples by simple subtracting). 
Fitting (26) to a data sample is a three-stage process. First, I apply the trial-and-error method 
 
to  get  the  best  correlation  of  a  data  sample  on  the  formula  (25)  by  setting  its  parameters  by 
hands. Second, I apply linear regression of the data sample on the formula (25) specified by the 

 

8

found parameters to estimate the model’s external parameters δ and γ. Finally, the parameters 
are varying a little to get the best regression fit.      

To start doing so in line with my approach I need the data on the workers’ wages but for the 
workers of the very same generation and for about 40 years. I could not find such data, and it is 
very likely there are no such data at all. (If there were such longitudinal study it would be very 
expensive.)  Moreover, if such data do exist, somebody could say these data were of little use; 
one would argue that neither economy, nor education would be stable for about 40 years.  

The  available  data  in  age-wage  profiles  for  workers  are  cross-section  ones,  i.e.  these  have 
been measured on overlapping generations. In the framework of my approach, such data cannot 
be  considered  "true”.  Nevertheless,  I  use  such  particular  data  in  regressions.  Should  be 
explained, why it is possible.  

The new Keynesian economics give us the reasons why the adjustment of wages and prices 
throughout  the  economy  is  staggered.  The  staggered  setting  of  individual  wages  makes  the 
overall  level  of  wages  sticky  (see  e.g.,  Mankiw,  1992).  The  new  Keynesians  argue  that  the 
stickiness  and  slowness  of  change  of  the  wages  result  also  from  acting  in  the  markets  such 
factors as contractual work, influence of trade unions, etc. Thus, one can expect that the starting 
slopes  of  the  age-wage  curves  may  vary  but  not  much  in  the  long  run.  The  workers  belong  to 
different  generations  but  they  all  are  working  at  present  time,  and  therefore  their  economic 
behavior is of a general pattern. In the present context, this means that those not observable age-
wage  profiles  at  micro  (personal)  level  are  parallel  to  those  that  are  seen  in  overlapping 
generations. Therefore, one can speculate that a kind of ergodicity hypothesis is true in this case, 
and thus the macro model (1) is true. The hypothesis is in line also with the approach; averaging, 
which  is  used  in  the  model  (see  e.g.  (3)),  also  suppresses  “vibrations”  or  “noise”  in  the 
competencies.   

The  expression  (26)  has  the  form,  which  is  alike  Keynes  law  for  aggregate  consumption. 
There,  in  (26)  the  first  parameter  might  be  considered  as  workers’  “autonomous”  wage 
”assigned” by labor market; the second parameter might be considered as employers’ marginal 
propensity to pay workers for their competencies. Market’s mechanisms make the overall level 
of “autonomous” wages adjust slowly in the long run; employers in mass are also inflexible in 
changing in the long run of the rates of paying for labor. As for α in Eq. (1), it is quite clear that 
that  is  related  closely  to  the  psycho-physiological  abilities  of  humans;  the  humans’  abilities  in 
mass (e.g. to acquire and to keep holding the knowledge) do not vary markedly for centuries.  
 
For the testing of the model (1), I used the data on the age-wage profiles for Finnish workers 
(Elo & Salonen, 2004). The ordinary least square method (OLS) was used in the study for fitting 
curve  (25)  to  the  data  samples.  In  the  Appendix,  I  present  all  the  results  of  modeling.  These 
results and some principal outcomes of the approach are discussed in the next section.     

The  presented  analysis  would  be  considered  incomplete  if  nothing  were  said  about  the 

relevance of Mincer’s formula to the solution found.    

By expanding (26) to power series, one can write

The unknown parameters 
 then can be found by differentiation (27) with respect to time, and 
then estimated in every point of the interval [0, T]. I found the expressions for 
 in the terms of 
model’s parameters but they turned out to be very sophisticated, and I was not able to give them 
an economic sense. It was also found, on the grounds of estimates, that the series in the right-
hand side of (27) converges too slowly to be effective for the approximation of the left-hand side 
of (27), and at any point of [0, T]. Therefore, I applied OLS to expression

Thus, I do speculate after my study that Mincer earnings function is just an approximation for the 
exact  solution  (26)  of  the  problem.  The  other  side  of  the  coin  is  that  the  exact  solution  is 
specified by the parameters, which are few and they are meaningful. While the formulas (25) and 
(26) present the regular ‘”law” made of Eq. (1), Mincer “law” is just an empirical one. As for 
extension of Mincer formula by simply adding the extra members, any smooth data can be fitted 
better and better by applying power series of higher order. 
 

Summary and some open questions  
 
The presented approach is based on the idea that worker’s competency has an economic value. 
The  approach  also  uses  the  ideas  on  the  motives  and  patterns  of  economic  behavior  clearly 
expressed by Gary S. Becker in his famous lecture (Becker, 1993). The approach resulting in the 
novel  model  takes  into  account  psycho-physiological  factors  of  humans  concerning  extra 
schooling and on-the-job training. Thus, both the approach and the model are more relevant than 
the known ones to consider education factors and humans’ abilities to the schooling influencing 
earnings.  
 
The  model  resulting  in  the  analytic  solution  provides  clear  and  simple  explanation  of 
mechanisms forming age-wage profiles for workers. These mechanisms provide for endogenous 
growth  of  initial  competency  of  worker,  worker’s  competency  damping,  and  changing  rate  of 
investment in extra schooling depending on workers’ earnings.

There are three important results of my study. I found that the overall process, which forms 
age-wage  profiles,  obeys  a  special  case  of  the  Fisk  PDF.  I  found  that  the  solution’s  analytic 
continuation is possible back in the times when people who are now the workers were studying 
at schools. I found that the solution gives quite good fitting to the samples of the observations. 
Thus, the study can be a ground for further development of the theory of human capital.   
Let us discuss in brief some principal outcomes of the study. As for endogenous growth of 
 
worker’s  initial  competency,  Table  A1 in  the  Appendix  shows  that  condition, 
pre-
assumed for analytic continuation of the solution back in the times of schooling holds. Formally, 
0=β   in  Eq.  (1),  one  can  see  the  endogenous  growth  of  worker’s  initial 
putting 
competency is set of being linear with time so Mincer formula holds with the model. Thus, both 
the starting slope and the initial point of solution’s curve can be considered a result of schooling 
the workers had had to that moment when they entered labor market. 
The  obtained  regression  curves  (see  in  the  Appendix)  are  very  close  to  those  seen  in  the 
 
experimental age-wage profiles for Finnish workers. In all cases, these curves provide for better 
fitting to the data than the minceranian curves do. The best-fit parameters for the model are listed 
in  Table  A1.  One  can  see  there,  the  damping  parameters  are  very  stable  but  there  are  some 
gender  differences  in  the  damping  of  competency.  These  differences  are  very  small  in 
magnitude.  I  am  skeptical  about  male  and  female  differences  in  the  ability  of  upholding  a 
competency  level.  The  effect  resulting  in  the  differences  is  rather  in  the  patterns  of  social 
behavior; women pay more attention to the families so female workers are some less motivated 
to keep doing well with professional knowledge than men do. On the other hand, female workers 
in  Finland  used  to  invest  in  extra  schooling  more  than  men  did,  and  the  model  “says”  that 
women  as  a  rule  had  more  progress  in  schooling  at  high  schools  so  their  initial  competencies 
were  higher  than  men  had.  The  male  workers’  initial  competencies  were  paid  less  than  the 
female workers’ ones were. On the other hand, the employers’ marginal propensity to pay for the 
male worker’s competency was higher. Thus, men were experiencing discrimination in starting 
wages, women in the rate of change of wages. These discrimination effects not resulting in the 
model’s  nature  change  were  externalities  of  labor  markets,  namely,  in  Finland  in  the  years  of 
1996, 1985, and 2001.  
 
Thus,  the  model  can  provide  an  easy  and  meaningful  analysis  of  outcomes  of  economic 
behavior  of  agents  in  labor  market,  namely,  the  age-wage  profiles  for  workers,  including 
motives, patterns, and outcomes of their interacting with an educating environment.  

The meanings of the model’s inner parameters are as following. The α-parameter presents an 
average rate of damping of competency (depends on the psycho-physiological characteristics of 
human brain), β-parameter is an average rate of investment in extra schooling (depends on the 
agents’ rational expectations), Z(1) is the logarithm of initial competency (indicates a level of), 
and Z’(1) is an average rate of (endogenous) growth of the initial competency. One can assume 
the  first  two  depend  on  time.  Then,  the  α-parameter  is  likely  to  follow  the  “law”  for  aptitude 
curves  (see  e.g.  (Phelps  J.  A.,  Brookhouse  K.,  1994)).  As  for  β-parameter,  I  guess  that  it  may 
depend on time more tangibly as its nature is closely related to the process of decision-making. 
Rather its behavior is an adaptive one.  

The δ-parameter and γ-parameter are outer ones to the model; these are set by the market. It 
is interesting to point here, if the inner parameters, the starting wages and the maximum wages 
are known in advance, then γ-parameter can be easily evaluated (see formulas (6a), (6b), (12), 
and (26)) by the formula:

      I  have  to  stress  once  again  that  the  presented  model  is  neither  a  “clone”  of  Mincer’s  nor  a 
type of model that uses ideas of production of human capital and/or allocation of (non-leisure) 

 

11

time (Ben-Porath, 1967). Worker’s competency 
underlying the approach is used here as a 
. Thus, from an economic standpoint the 
formal function for better visualization of wages 
age-competency profiles for workers are by-product of the approach, but they are not by-product 
with respect to education. I consider the age-competency model as an effective tool to the study 
of educational outcomes. To be more accurate with wording “worker’s competency’, I have to 
point out here that it has the meaning of “paid competency”. In the framework of the approach, it 
could be named “E

3-competency”, i.e. “education × economy × earnings & competency”.

)(tW

In conclusion, I have to point out that the presented approach gives theoretical grounds for 
posing  and  solving  the  problems  (e.g.,  optimization)  in  the  field  of  economics  of  education, 
income  and  lifetime  analysis.  The  approach  resulting  in  the  model  is  based  on  few  ideas  and 
these  are  quite  clear  and  logical.  The  analytic  solution  brought  forward  with  the  model  can  be 
practically applied to the studying of age-wage profiles for workers. Improvements can be made 
with  the  model  by  assuming  its  parameters  depending  on  time.  Fitting  the  model’s  solution  to 
more sample data would result in estimates that might be used for strengthening my theory and 
for  forecasting.  (Given  the  obtained  estimates  (see  Table  A1  in  the  Appendix),  I  present  a 
forecast  for  the  age-wage  profiles  for  Finnish  workers  (men)  in  the  year  of  2015.)  These  and 
other relevant problems will be discussed in forthcoming articles.

This paper describes an experimental and modeling study of the oxidation of the three 

isomers of xylene (ortho-, meta- and para-xylenes). For each compound, ignition delay times 

of  hydrocarbon-oxygen-argon  mixtures  with  fuel  equivalence  ratios  from  0.5  to  2  were 

measured behind reflected shock waves for temperatures from 1330 to 1800 K and pressures 

from 6.7 to 9 bar. The results show a similar reactivity for the three isomers. 

A detailed kinetic mechanism has been proposed, which reproduces our experimental 

results, as well as some literature data obtained in a plug flow reactor at 1155 K showing a 

clear  difference of reactivity between the three isomers of xylene. The main reaction paths 

have  been  determined  by  sensitivity  and  flux  analyses  and  have  allowed  the  differences  of 

reactivity to be explained.

INTRODUCTION 

 

Aromatic  compounds  are  present  in  significant  amounts  in  gasolines  (~35%)  and 

diesel  fuels  (~30%)  [1].  Nevertheless,  detailed  chemical  kinetic  models  for  the  combustion 

and the oxidation of aromatic compounds are still scarce and mainly restricted to benzene [2-

11] or toluene [12-24]. We have recently published a paper presenting an experimental and 

modeling  study  of  the  oxidation  of  toluene  [24]  that  we  have  used  as  a  basis  for  this  work 

about the oxidation of xylenes. 

 

Xylenes are important components of gasolines (up to 10 % for the sum of the three 

isomers),  with  high  research  octane  numbers  (117.5  for  meta-xylene  and  116.4  for 

para-xylene) close to that of toluene (120) [1]. The existing experimental studies concerning 

the  reactions  with  oxygen  of  the  three  isomers  of  xylenes  have  been  obtained  in  a  flow 

reactor [25, 26] at ~1150 K, in a rapid compression machine [27, 28] between 600 and 900 K 

and in a single cylinder spark ignition engine [29]. The oxidation of meta and para-xylenes 

has  also  been  studied  in  a  jet-stirred  reactor  [30,  31]  between  900  and  1300  K  and  that  of 

para-xylene  in  a  shock  tube  [30]  between  1450  and  1760  K.  Qualitative  mechanisms 

explaining  the  experimental  phenomena  observed  have  been  proposed  [25,  28],  but,  up  to 

now, only one detailed kinetic mechanism has been published in the case of para-xylene [30]. 

The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  present  new  experimental  data  for  the  oxidation  of  ortho-, 

meta- and para-xylenes obtained in a shock tube from 1300 to 1820 K and pressures from 6.7 

to  9  bar  and  to  propose  a  mechanism  able  to  model  these  experimental  results,  as  well  as 

literature data obtained in a flow reactor at ~1150 K [25, 26]. 

 

EXPERIMENTAL IGNITION DELAYS TIMES 

As it is already described in detail in previous papers [11, 33, 34], we will just recall 

here  the  main  features  of  this  experimental device. The  reaction (400 cm  long, 7.8 cm i.d.) 

and  the  driver  (90  cm  long,  12.8  cm  i.d.)  parts  of  this  stainless  steel  shock  tube  were 

 
separated  by  two  terphane  diaphragms,  which  were  ruptured  by  decreasing  suddenly  the 

pressure in the space separating them. The driver gas was helium. The incident and reflected 

shock velocities were measured by four piezo-electric pressure transducers located along the 

3

reaction section. 

As in our previous work [11, 24, 33, 34], the temperature and the pressure of the test 

gas  behind  the  incident  and  the  reflected  shock  waves  were  derived  from  the  value  of  the 

incident shock velocity by using ideal one-dimensional shock equations.  

The onset of ignition was detected by OH radical emission at 306 nm through a quartz 

window with a photomultiplier fitted with a monochromator at the end of the reaction part. 

The last pressure transducer was located at the same place along the axis of the tube as the 

quartz window. The ignition delay time was defined as the time interval between the pressure 

rise measured by the last pressure transducer due to the arrival of the reflected shock wave 

and the rise of the optical signal by the photomultiplier up to 10% of its maximum value. 

Oxygen  (99.5%  pure),  argon  and  helium  (both  99.995%  pure)  were  supplied  by 

Alphagaz - L'Air Liquide. Para-xylene (99 % pure) was provided by Merck-Schuchardt and 

ortho-xylene  (98  %  pure)  and  meta-xylene  (97  %  pure)  by  Sigma-Aldrich.  Fresh  reaction 

mixtures  were  manometrically  prepared  every  day  and  mixed  using  a  recirculation  pump. 

Before each introduction of the reaction mixture (from 100 to 400 kPa), the reaction section 

was  flushed  with  pure  argon  and  evacuated  (below  10-2  kPa),  in  order  that  the  residual  gas 

was  mainly  argon.  The  study  was  performed  under  the  following  experimental  conditions 

(after the reflected shock): 

♦  Temperature (T) from 1330 to 1800 K. 

♦  Pressure (P) from 6.7 to 9 bar. 

♦  For each of the three isomers, mixtures (xylene : oxygen : argon : in molar percent) were 

(0.375  :  7.875  :  91.75),  (0.375  :  3.937  :   95.687),  (0.375  :  1.969  :  97.653)  and  (0.625  : 

6.562 : 92.812), respectively, which correspond to three different equivalence ratios (Φ = 

 

 

 

 

4

0.5,  1  and  2)  and  to  two  different  concentrations  of  xylene  (0.375  %  and  0.625  %)  and 

lead to ignition delay times from 3 to 800 µs.  

Tables I to III and Figures 1 to 3 present the experimental results thus obtained.  

TABLES I TO III – FIGURES 1 TO 3 

The scatter of the results is larger than in the cases of benzene [11] or toluene [24] ; 

that  is  probably  due  to  the  lower  volatibility  of  xylenes  (boiling  points  between  138  and 

142 °C)  compared  to  that  of  toluene  (boiling  point  =  111°C)  or  benzene  (boiling  point  = 

80 °C)  inducing  then  more  condensation  and  absorption  problems.  For  the  twelve  studied 

mixtures,  ignition  delay  times  (τ) decrease when temperature rises and varies exponentially 

vs. 1000/T. For each xylene, it is also shown that for a given T, ignition delay times increase 

with  the  equivalence  ratio  of  the  mixture  for  a  given  concentration  of  hydrocarbon,  and 

slightly  decrease  with  concentration.  It  is  worth  noting  that  in  the  case  of  toluene  [24], 

ignition delay times notably increase when the concentration of hydrocarbon increases, while 

they decrease in the case of benzene [11].  

FIGURE 4 

Figure  4,  shows  that,  under  the  same  experimental  conditions,  the  three  isomers  of 

xylenes have the samilar reactivity. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE REACTION MECHANISMS 

These  three  mechanisms,  which  are  available  on  request,  have  been  written  in  the 

CHEMKIN II [32] format and include three parts: 

♦  A  primary  mechanism  containing  53  reactions  for  ortho-xylene  and  para-xylene  and  51 

reactions for meta-xylene, in which only xylene and oxygen are considered as molecular 

reactants, 

♦  A  secondary  mechanism  including  163  reactions  for  ortho-xylene,  137  reactions  for 

meta-xylene  and  138  reactions  for  para-xylene,  in  which  the  reactants  are  the  main 

 

molecular  products  (apart  toluene)  formed by  the  primary  mechanism.  The  primary  and 

5

secondary mechanism for ortho-xylene includes then 216 reactions. 

♦  The mechanisms for the oxidation of benzene [11] and toluene [24] connected to a C0-C6 

reaction base, which is described in recent papers [33, 34]. 

As shown by Emdee et al. [25, 26], benzene and toluene are some important products 

of the oxidation of xylenes. As previously presented [11], the mechanism for the oxidation of 

benzene contains 135 reactions and includes the reactions of benzene and of cyclohexadienyl, 

phenyl,  phenylperoxy,  phenoxy,  hydroxyphenoxy,  cyclopentadienyl,  cyclopentadienoxy  and 

hydroxycyclopentadienyl  free  radicals,  as  well  as  the  reactions  of  ortho-benzoquinone, 

phenol, cyclopentadiene, cyclopentadienone and vinylketene, which are the primary products 

yielded. The mechanism for the oxidation of toluene contains 193 reactions and includes the 

reactions  of  toluene  and  of  benzyl,  tolyl,  peroxybenzyl  (methylphenyl),  alcoxybenzyl  and 

cresoxy free radicals, as well as the reactions of benzaldehyde, benzyl hydroperoxyde, cresol, 

benzylalcohol, ethylbenzene, styrene and bibenzyl.  

The C0-C6 reaction base was constructed from a review of the recent literature and is 

an extension of our previous C0-C2 reaction base [35, 33]. This C0-C2 reaction base includes 

the  reactions  of  radicals  or  molecules  including  carbon,  hydrogen  and  oxygen  atoms  and 

containing less than three carbon atoms. The kinetic data used in this base were taken from 

the literature and are mainly those proposed by Baulch et al. [36] and Tsang et al. [37]. The 

C0-C6  reaction  base  includes  reactions  involving  C3H2,  C3H3,  C3H4  (allene  and  propyne), 

C3H5  (three  isomers),  C3H6,  C4H2,  C4H3  (2  isomers),  C4H4,  C4H5  (5  isomers),  C4H6  (1,3-

butadiene,  1,2-butadiene,  methyl-cyclopropene,  1-butyne  and  2-butyne),  as  well  as  the 

formation  of  benzene  [33,  34].  Pressure-dependent  rate  constants  follow  the  formalism 

proposed by Troe [38] and efficiency coefficients have been included. This reaction base was 

constructed  in  order  to  model  experimental  results  obtained  in  a  jet-stirred  reactor  for 

methane and ethane [35], profiles in laminar flames of methane, acetylene and 1,3-butadiene 

 
[33] and shock tube auto-ignition delays for acetylene, propyne, allene, 1,3-butadiene [33], 1-

6

butyne and 2-butyne [34]. 

 

Heats  of  formation,  specific  heats,  and  entropies  of  the  molecules  or  radicals 

considered have been mainly calculated using software THERGAS [39], based on the group 

and  bond  additivity  methods  proposed  by  Benson  [40],  and  stored  as  14  polynomial 

coefficients, according to the CHEMKIN II formalism [32]. It must be kept in mind that the 

precision obtained by using group additivity methods to estimate heats of formation is around 

2 kcal/mol for molecules and 4 kcal/mol for radicals [40]. Table IV presents, in the case of 

ortho-xylene the names, the formulae and the heats of formation of the 35 aromatic species 

which are not included in the mechanism for the oxidation of benzene [11] and toluene [24]. 

The  heats  of  formation  of  the  isomers  involved in  the  mechanisms  are  very  close  whatever 

the ortho, meta or para position of the ring substituents, apart from xylylenes. Ortho and para-

xyxylenes  have  been  considered  in  their  quinoid  structure,  which  is  the  most  stable  ;  the 

formation  of  meta-xylylene  which  is  in  a  triplet  electronic  ground  state  with  a  heat  of 

formation,  ∆Hf (298K) = 74 kcal/mol [41], has not been considered.  

TABLE IV  

The primary and secondary mechanisms for the oxidation of xylenes are presented in 

table  V,  as  well  as  the  references  related  to  the  kinetic  data.  For  the  shortness  this  table,  a 

reaction  common  to  the  three  isomers  is  written  only  once  without  specifying  the  type  of 

isomer  involved.  The  mechanism  of  a  given  isomer  includes  all  the  common  reactions,  as 

well as the reactions specific to this type of isomer. The rate parameters for the metatheses 

are  not  displayed  as  they  are  directly  derived  from  the  mechanism  for  toluene  [24]  or 

benzene [11]. 

 

Primary mechanism 

TABLE V 

7

The  primary  mechanism  includes  the  reactions  of  xylene  molecules  and  of 

methylbenzyl, methyltolyl, tolylmethoxyl and methylcresoxyl free radicals. 

Unimolecular  decompositions  (1  and  2,  numbers  referring  to  Table  V)  of  xylene 

molecules  give  either  methylbenzyl  radicals  and  H  atoms  or  tolyl  and  methyl  radicals. 

Reaction  1  is  one  of  the  few  elementary  steps  involving  xylenes  which  have  been 

experimentally investigated. Da Costa et al. [42] have shown that the three isomers exhibit a 

very  close  reactivity  for  the  decomposition  giving  H  atoms  and  have  proposed  the  rate 

expressions  that  we  have  used  with  a  A-factor  divided  by  two.  For  reaction  2,  we  have 

considered a rate constant four times higher than that used for the similar reaction in the case 

of toluene: the presence of two possible methyl groups would accounts for a factor 2, but a 

factor 4 leads to better agreement in simulations related to the shock tube, as reaction 2 is an 

influential  reaction  as  shown  further  in  the  text.  The  ratio  between  the  A-factors  used  for 

reactions  1  and  2  for  xylene  is  then  close  to  that  used  toluene.  The  addition  of  H-atoms  to 

xylene molecules leads to the formation of toluene and methyl radicals (4), the addition of O-

atoms  gives  H  atoms  and  methylcresoxyl  radicals  (5)  and  the  addition  of  OH  radicals 

produces H-atoms and methylbenzyl alcohol (6). As in the case of toluene [24], an important 

part of the reactions of xylene molecules involves the formation of the resonance stabilized 

methylbenzyl radicals by unimolecular (1) and bimolecular (3) initiations and by metatheses 

with H-abstraction (7-23). The rate constants are directly deduced from those of the similar 

reactions in the case of toluene taking into account the number of abstractable H-atoms; this 

assumption  has  been  proved  correct  in  the  case  of  the  abstraction  by  H-atoms  by  a 

comparison with the experimental value proposed by Hippler et al. [49] (A = 4x1014 and Ea = 

8.4 kcal/mol compared to A = 4.8x1014 and Ea = 8.4 kcal/mol with our assumption). We have 

also  considered  the  formation  of  methyl  tolyl  radicals  by  abstraction  of  phenylic  H-atoms 

 
(24-28),  with  rate  constants  deriving  from  those  of  the  similar  reactions  in  the  case  of 

8

benzene [11].  

The  reactions  common  to  the  three  isomers  of  methylbenzyl  radicals  are  directly 

derived from those of benzyl radicals : decomposition to form acetylene (29), reaction with 

oxygen molecules (31) and termination reactions with other radicals (34-39). By analogy with 

benzyl  radicals,  the  decomposition  (29)  would  lead  to  the  formation  of  •C5H4CH3  radicals, 

but  Emdee  et  al.  [26]  proposed  a  fast  rearrangement  of  this  species  to  give  •H  atoms  and 

benzene.  As  we  consider  here  only  a  high  temperature  mechanism  to  model  results  above 

1100  K,  we  have  neglected  the  formation  of  methylperoxybenzyl  radicals.  The  reaction  of 

methylbenzyl  radicals  with  oxygen  molecules  lead  to  tolylmethoxyl  radicals  and  O-atoms. 

Methylbenzyl  radicals  can  combine  with  OH,  CH3,  HO2  and  themselves,  to  give 

methylbenzylalcohol,  ethyltoluene,  methylbenzylhydroperoxide  and  bi-methylbenzyl, 

respectively. The reactions with •O• atoms, which are important at high temperature, lead to 

tolyl  radicals  and  formaldehyde  molecules  (32)  or  to  •H  atoms  and  tolualdehyde  molecules 

(35).  Ortho-  and  para-methylbenzyl  radicals  can  also  react  by  decomposition  (30)  or  with 

oxygen  molecules  (32)  to  form  xylylenes.  The  rate  constants  of  the  decomposition  by 

breaking  of  a  C-H  bond  are  those  measured  by  Fernandes  et  al.  [43]  and  those  for  the 

reactions with oxygen is based on the value proposed by Emdee et al. [26] for para-xylene. 

The  activation  energy  (13.7  kcal/mol)  proposed  by  Emdee  et  al.  is  consistent  with  the 

enthalpy  of  reaction  which  is  about  10  kcal/mol  at  1000  K.  The  formations  of 

dihydronaphthalene  and  methylindene  proposed  by  Marinov  et  al.  [44]  by  addition  to 

acetylene molecules of ortho-methylbenzyl radicals and meta- or para-methylbenzyl radicals, 

respectively, have also been taken into account (33). 

The reactions of methyl tolyl radicals (40-46) have been adapted from those proposed 

for phenyl radicals [11] and includes reactions with oxygen molecules to give •O• atoms and 

methyl cresoxyl radicals and termination steps with other radicals. 

9

 

Tolylmethoxyl radicals can react with oxygen to give tolualdehyde and •HO2 radicals 

(49),  by  termination  with  H-atoms  to  give  methyl  benzyl  alcohol  (50)  or  by  beta-scissions. 

Two beta-scissions are possible, the first involving the breaking of a C-H bond (47) to give 

tolualdehyde and H-atoms and the second involving the breaking of a C-C bond (48) to form 

formaldehyde and methyl phenyl radicals. As in the case of toluene, we have used the same 

activation energy for both channels. 

The reaction of methyl cresoxyl radicals are the same as for cresoxyl radicals, i.e. CO 

elimination (51-52) and combination with H-atoms yielding methylcresol (53).  

 

Secondary mechanism 

 

Apart  from  the  additions  of  H-atoms,  which lead to •CHO radicals and toluene (57) 

and  to  benzaldehyde  and  methyl  radicals  (58),  the  reactions  of  tolualdehyde  molecules 

involve the formation by initiations and by H-abstraction of two resonance stabilized radicals: 

methylbenzoyl  radicals  (formed  by  reactions  54,  55,  59-74),  which  decompose  to  methyl 

phenyl radicals and carbon monoxide (91), and methoxybenzyl radicals (formed by reaction 

56, 74-90), which react according to the main steps of benzyl radicals (reactions 92-98) and 

lead to the formation of phthaladehyde or benzaldehyde. 

Methyl  benzyl  hydroperoxyde  molecules  can  easily  decompose  by  rupture  of  the 

O-OH  bond  (99)  with  the  rate  constant  proposed  for  the  decomposition  of  benzyl 

hydroperoxyde molecules [24]. 

 

Methyl cresol molecules can react by addition of H-atoms, to give methyl radicals and 

cresols (102), or by bimolecular initiations (100 and 101) and by H-abstraction (103-118 and 

119-134)  to  lead  to  the  formation  of  two  resonance  stabilized  radicals,  methylcresoxyl  and 

methylhydroxybenzyl 

radicals, 

respectively. 

The 

reactions 

deriving 

from 

methylhydroxybenzyl  radicals  (135-147)  are  deduced  from  the  major  steps  deriving  from 

benzyl radicals. 

10

 

Apart from the additions of H-atoms, which lead to CH2OH radicals and toluene (149) 

or  to  methyl  radicals  and  benzyl  alcohol  (150),  the  reactions  of  methylbenzylalcohol 

molecules involve the formation of the resonance stabilized tolylmethylhydroxyl radicals by 

bimolecular  initiation  (148)  and  by  H-abstraction  (151-166).  The  formation  of  the  other 

possible radicals with a higher energy of formation has been neglected. Tolylmethylhydroxyl 

radicals can decompose to hydrogen atoms and tolualdehyde (167).  

In the case of ethyltoluene molecules, the additions of H-atoms lead to C2H5 radicals 

and  toluene  (170)  or  to  ethylbenzene  and  methyl  radicals  (171).  Unimolecular  (168), 

bimolecular  initiation  (169)  and  H-abstraction  (172-187)  involve  the  formation  of  the 

resonance stabilized tolylethyl radicals; the formation of the other possible radicals has been 

neglected, because they are not resonance stabilized. Tolylethyl radicals lead to the formation 

of    methylstyrene  by  decompositions  involving  the  breaking  of  a  C-H  bond  (188)  or  by 

reaction  with  oxygen  molecules  (189)  or  combine  with  HO2  radicals  (190)  to  give 

hydroperoxide molecules, which quickly decompose.  

In  the  case  of  bimethylbenzyl  molecules,  we  have  only  considered  the  formation  of 

the  resonance  stabilized  ditolylethyl  radicals  by  unimolecular  (191)  and  bimolecular  (192) 

initiation  and  by  H-abstraction  (193-208).  Ditolylethyl  radicals  radicals  can  decompose  to 

give hydrogen atoms and dimethylstilbene (209).  

The reactions of xylylenes have not been much investigated previously. We consider 

that they can react with O-atoms to give methoxybenzyl radicals (212). Roth et al. [45] have 

studied the isomerization of o-xylylene to give benzocyclobutene (210) and proposed a rate 

constant  that  we  have  used.  Benzocyclobutene  leads  to  styrene  (211)  with  a  rate  constant 

proposed by Tsang et al. [46]. 

Dihydronaphthalene  leads  to  naphthalene  through  H-abstraction  by  H  and  O  atoms 

and OH radicals (213-215) and beta-scission involving the breaking of a C-H bond (216). 

 

 

 

 

 

 
COMPARISON BETWEEN COMPUTED AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

Simulations were performed using the CHEMKIN II software [32]. We have tried to 

reproduce  our  experimental  data  obtained  in  a  shock  tube,  but  to  extend  the  validity  of  the 

proposed mechanism, we have also attempted to model results of the literature obtained in a 

11

flow tube [25, 26].  

Shock tubes 

Computed results for our shock tube appear in figures 1 to 4. It is worth noting that 

the  experimental  OH  emission  at  306 nm  is  related  to  the  electronically  exited  OH* 

population  and  is  not  directly  proportional  to  OH  radical  concentration.  Nevertheless, 

previous  work  [33]  has  shown  a  correct  agreement  between  the  shapes  of  the  profiles  of 

experimental emission and calculated OH concentration during the rise of the signal, which is 

the important part of the curve for the determination of ignition delays. Both experimentally 

and  theoretically,  the  ignition  delay  is  determined  at  10%  of  the  maximum  OH  peak. 

Simulations  reproduce  the  systematic  trends  of  the  measurements,  including  variations  in 

ignition  delay  times  with  temperature,  equivalence  ratio  and  concentration  of  hydrocarbon 

and that for the three isomers of xylenes. Simulations shown in fig. 4 reproduce well the fact 

that these three compounds have a very similar reactivity under these conditions. 

Flow reactor 

Emdee  et  al. [25, 26]  have  studied the  oxidation  of the three isomers of xylene in a 

flow  reactor  at  ~1150  K,  at  atmospheric  pressure,  with  nitrogen  as  bath  gas,  for  an  initial 

concentration of xylene from 1400 to 1700 ppm and for equivalence ratios from 0.47 to 1.7. 

Figures  5  to  7  display  comparisons  between  the  experimental  and  computed  mole 

fraction  of  reactants  and  main  products  for  the  three  xylenes  for  stochiometric  mixtures. 

These figures show that a globally correct agreement can be observed. The consumptions of 

12

 
hydrocarbon and oxygen (fig. 5a, 6a, 7a) are correctly reproduced, even if that of meta-xylene 

is  slightly  underestimated.  The  formation  of  major  products,  tolualdehyde  (fig.  5a,  6a,  7a), 

ethyl-toluene (fig. 5b, 6b, 7b), phthaldehyde (fig. 7b), methyl styrene (fig. 6b), toluene (fig. 

5b, 6b, 7b), benzaldehyde (fig. 7b), benzene (fig. 5b, 6b), carbon monoxide (fig. 5a, 6a, 7a), 

methane (fig. 6b) and acetylene (fig. 7b) is also globally well captured by the simulations. In 

the case of ortho-xylene, the formation of styrene and naphthalene (fig. 5b), which is specific 

to this compound, is correctly simulated.  

FIGURES 5-7 

Figure  8  displays  a  comparison  between  the  conversion  of  the  three  xylenes  and 

shows that the proposed models correctly reproduce the difference of reactivity between these 

three  compounds.  Ortho-xylene  is  much  more  reactive  than  meta-  and  para-xylene,  while 

para-xylene is slightly more reactive than meta-xylene. A comparison with the conversion of 

toluene computed under the same conditions as para-xylene shows that the monosubstituted 

compound  is much less reactive for residence time below 40 ms and has a reactivity close to 

that of meta-xylene for larger residence times.

ANALYSIS OF THE MECHANISM AND DISCUSSION 

 

The  flow  and  sensitivity  analyses  presented  hereafter  have  been  performed  with  the 

three mechanisms described previously. The accuracy of conclusions derived from them can 

only reflect the accuracy of the proposed reaction channels and of the used thermodynamic 

and kinetic data.  

Figures  9  and  10  present  sensitivity  and  flow  analyses,  respectively,  computed  in  a 

flow  reactor  at  1155 K.  Sensitivity  analyses  have  been  performed  to  know  the  effect  of  a 

variation  of  a  given  rate  constant  on  the  mole  fraction  of  carbon  monoxide.  A  positive 

coefficient indicates that the related reaction has a promoting effect. Sensitivity analyses are 

 
displayed for the three xylenes, but this flow analysis is only shown for ortho-xylene, as this 

isomer  involves  the  highest  numbers  of  reaction  pathways  including  all  those  which  are 

common to the three species. These analyses have been performed at the same residence time 

corresponding to a conversion of 36 % for ortho-xylene, 9.5% for meta-xylene and 18 % for

para-xylene.  

FIGURES 9-10 

Figures  11  and  12  present  sensitivity  and  flow  analyses,  respectively,  computed  in  a  shock 

tube. The analysis displayed in fig. 11 is for meta-xylene and shows the influence of the most 

sensitive reactions consuming xylene. Figure 11 presents also a comparison with toluene for a 

mixture with a close composition (Φ =1, 0.5% toluene compared to 0.625 % of xylene) and 

shows that this monosubstituted aromatic species is much less reactive than xylenes. The flux 

analysis displayed in fig. 12 has been computed for para-xylene at 1720 K. 

FIGURES 11-12 

 

Main reaction pathways of xylene molecules 

Low temperature 

At 1155 K, in flow reactor conditions, whatever the isomers, xylene molecules mainly 

react according to four types of reactions in a very similar way compared to toluene: 

♦ 

Ipso-additions  of  H-atoms  to  give  methyl  radicals  and  toluene  (reaction  4  in  Table  V, 

12 % of the consumption for ortho-xylene under the conditions of fig. 10), 

♦  Abstractions  of  phenylic  H-atoms  mainly  by  OH  radicals  to  give  methyltolyl  radicals  

(reactions  24,  13  %  of  the  consumption  for  ortho-xylene),  which  mostly  react  with 

oxygen molecules to form methylcresoxy radicals, 

♦ 

Ipso-additions of O-atoms to give H-atoms and methylcresoxy radicals (reaction 5, 13 % 

of  the  consumption  for  ortho-xylene),  which  mostly  decompose  to  give  carbon 

monoxide and benzene and methyl radicals or toluene and H-atoms, 

14

 

♦  Abstractions  of  benzylic  H-atoms  mainly  by  H  atoms  and  OH  radicals  to  give 

methylbenzyl radicals  (reactions 7  and 9, 60 % of the consumption for ortho-xylene). 

Figure 9 shows that, at 1155 K, the ipso-additions of H-atoms have a slight inhibiting effect 

as  they  consume  H-atoms  to  form  the  less  reactive  methyl  radicals.  The  sensitivity  on  the 

formation  of  carbon  monoxide  of  the  ipso-additions  of  O-atoms  (reaction  5)  is  probably 

enhanced  by  the  fact  that  methylcresoxy  radicals  lead  mainly  to  carbon  monoxide  through 

reactions 51 and 52. The abstractions of  benzylic H-atoms reactions have a strong inhibiting 

effect  as  they  lead  to  resonance  stabilized    methylbenzyl  radicals,  which  react  mainly  by 

termination  steps.  To  the  contrary,  the  abstractions  of  phenylic  H-atoms,  which  directly 

compete with the previous ones, have a strong promoting effect. 

Initiation reactions (1, 2 or 3) are also present in the sensitivity analysis shown in fig. 9, 

even  if  their  fluxes  of  consumption  of  xylene  are  negligible,  apart  from  reaction  (2)  which 

accounts for 8% of the consumption of meta-xylene and strongly accelerates the oxidation of 

this  species.  Reaction  (1)  exhibits  an  important  negative  coefficient  because  the  reverse 

termination step is dominant.  

High temperature 

At  1720  K,  whatever  the  isomers,  the  flux  analysis  gives  a  much  different  picture: 

xylene molecules mainly react according to only three types of reactions : 

♦ 

Ipso-additions  of  H-atoms  to  give  methyl  radicals  and  toluene  (reaction  4,  6  %  of  the 

consumption for para-xylene under the conditions of fig. 12), 

♦  Abstractions  of  benzylic  H-atoms  mainly  by  H  atoms  and  OH  radicals  to  give 

methylbenzyl radicals (reactions 7 and 9, 16 % of the consumption for para-xylene), 

♦  Unimolecular  initiation  to  give  methyl  radicals  and  tolyl  radicals  (reaction  2,  75 %  of 

the  consumption  for  para-xylene),  which  mainly  react  with  oxygen  molecules  to  give 

ultimately carbon monoxide and benzene.  

15

 

Figure  11  displayed  simulations  obtained  by  dividing  by  10  the  rate  constant  of  the 

unimolecular  initiation  (2)  showing  the  strong  promoting effect of this reaction at 1720 K. 

This figure displays also the effect of a division by 10 of the rate constant of the abstraction 

of benzylic H-atoms by H atoms (7) and OH radicals (9) enlightening the strong inhibiting 

effect of these reactions. The fact that the rate constant of the unimolecular initiation (1) is 

larger in the case of xylenes compared to toluene (a factor 6 at 1700K) mostly explains the 

lower reactivity of the monosubstituted aromatic compounds shown in fig. 11. While a study 

of  the  fast  flow  pyrolysis  of  p-xylene  between  1200  and  1380  K  [50]  showed  some 

importance  of  the  H-abstraction  between  tolyl  radicals  and  xylene,  the  flow  rate  of  this 

reaction was found negligible under the conditions of fig. 10 and 12. 

 

Reactions deriving from the formation of methylbenzyl radicals and explanation of the 

difference of reactivity between the three isomers 

Low temperature 

At  1155  K,  in  flow  reactor  conditions,  as  benzyl  radicals,  the  three  isomers  of 

methylbenzyl radicals react mainly by termination steps with H-atoms (reaction –1), O-atoms 

(reaction 34, 35) and OH (reaction 36), methyl (reaction 38), and HO2 (reaction 37) radicals. 

The termination reactions with H-atoms, OH and methyl radicals form, respectively, xylene, 

methyl  benzylalcohol  and  ethyltoluene,  which  leads  to  methylstyrene,  and  have  a  slight 

inhibiting  effect.  A  small  fraction  of  the  reaction  with  O-atoms  leads  to  tolyl  radicals 

(reaction  34),  which  react  with  oxygen  molecules  through  a  branching  step  to  give 

methylphenoxy radicals and O-atoms. That explains the promoting effect of this reaction and 

the  inhibiting  one  of  the  directly  competing  channel  producing  tolualdehyde  and  H-atoms 

(reaction 35). The termination steps with HO2• radicals have a strong promoting effect as they 

form a hydroperoxide which almost immediately decomposes to give OH and tolylmethoxyl 

radicals  (reaction  99).  These  last  radicals  in  turn  decompose  to  produce  formaldehyde  and 

 
tolyl  radicals  (reaction  48)  or  H-atoms  and  tolualdehyde  (reaction  47).  Tolualdehyde  can 

react  by  abstraction  by  OH  radicals  of  either  a  benzylic  H-atom  (reaction  77)  to  lead  to 

benzaldehyde  and  formaldehyde  or  to  phthaldehyde  or  a  aldehydic  H-atom  (reaction  61)  to 

16

involve the formation of benzene and carbon monoxide. 

In the case of meta-methylbenzyl radicals, these termination steps are the only possible 

reactions  and  that  explains  the  very  low  reactivity  of  meta-xylene,  especially  as  the 

consumption of H-atoms by the termination step with methylbenzyl radicals has a higher flow 

rate  than  that  by  branching  step  with  oxygen  molecules.  In  the  case  of  ortho-  and  para- 

methylbenzyl radicals, the formation of xylylene by reaction with oxygen molecules (reaction 

32) is possible and has an important flux (20 % of the consumption of xylene). This reaction 

increases the concentration of HO2 radicals, which is more than 10 times larger in the case of 

ortho-and para-xylene than for the meta isomer in the same conditions. This step favors the 

formation  of  methylbenzylhydroperoxide  and  promotes  the  global  reactivity  of  ortho-and 

para-xylene as shown in fig. 8.  

In  summary,  the  reactions  of  meta-xylene  are  very  similar  to  that  of  toluene,  which 

explains why both compounds have a close reactivity for residence times above 40 ms in a 

flow  reactor,  as  shown  in  fig.  8.  Nevertheless,  as  the  reversible  recombinations  of  benzyl 

radicals  with  themselves  (∆Hr(298K)  =  -64.1  kcal/mol)  are  thermodynamically  favoured 

compared to that of methylbenzyl radicals (reaction 39) (∆Hr(298K) = -49.2 kcal/mol), their 

fluxes  are  larger  for  toluene  (13.5%  of  the  consumption  benzyl  radicals  under  the  same 

conditions as in  fig. 10) than for xylenes (0.04% of the consumption methylbenzyl radicals 

for  meta-xylene).  That  explains  why  the  conversion  of  toluene  is  much  lower  for  low 

residence times, before an equilibrium bibenzyl concentration is reached. 

Ortho-xylylene  is  consumed  for  around  50  %  by  addition  of  H-atoms  to  give  back 

methylbenzyl radicals (reaction –30) and for 50 % by isomerisation to give benzocyclobutene 

(reaction  210)  and  then  styrene  (reaction  211);  while  para-xylylene  is  80%  consumed  by 

 
addition  of  H-atoms  to  give  back  methylbenzyl  radicals  and  only  20  %  by  reaction  with 

O-atoms  to  give  H-atoms  and  methoxybenzyl  radicals  (reaction  212).  The  consumption  of 

H-atoms  to  give  back  the  resonance  stabilized  methylbenzyl  radicals  decreases  the  global 

reactivity  and  the  absence  of  possible  concurrent isomerisation in the case of para-xylylene 

17

explains then why it is much less reactive than ortho-xylene as shown in fig. 8. 

High temperature 

At  1720  K,  methylbenzyl  radicals  react  mainly  by  termination  steps  with  H-atoms  

(reaction  –1)  and  with  O-atoms  to  give  tolualdehyde  and  H-atoms  (reaction  35).  The 

formation of para-xylylene under the conditions of figure 12 has a very small flux (2% of the 

consumption of xylene), which explains why there is no difference of reactivity in shock tube 

experiments,  taking  into  account  that  the  rate  constants  of  the  very  sensitive  initiation 

reaction  (reaction  1)  and  abstractions  of  benzylic  H-atoms  (reactions  7  and  9)  are  the  same 

whatever the isomer. 

CONCLUSION 
 

This paper presents new experimental results for the autoignition of the three isomers 

of xylene in a shock tube between 1300 to 1820 K, showing a similar reactivity for the three 

compounds. It also proposes a set of detailed mechanisms able to reproduce these data, but 

also  previously  published  experiments  in  a  flow  reactor  at  1155  K  [25,  26]  exhibiting 

important differences of reactivity between the three species. To our knowledge, it is the first 

attempt  of  a  kinetic  detailed  modeling  of  the  three  isomers  of  this  bisubstituted  aromatic 

species. 

The reactions of importance in these mechanisms have been determined by using flux 

and sensitivity analyses. That has allowed us to explain the differences of reactivity obtained 

between  the  three  isomers  of  xylenes:  the  possible  ways  of  formation  and  consumption  of 

xylylenes are responsible of the important differences of reactivity observed in a flow reactor 

18

 
at 1155 K, while the dominant importance of initiation reactions with the same rate constant 

encounters the fact that no difference is obtained in a shock tube between 1300 and 1800 K. 

It  is  worth  noting  that  these  mechanisms  are  mostly  based  on  reactions  and  rate 

constants guessed from analogies with toluene and benzene and should certainly be revisited 

when  more  experimental  data  are  available.  Future work could include the extension of the 

validity these mechanisms towards lower temperatures, i.e. below 1000 K, by considering the 

formation  of  peroxy  radicals,  in  order  to  model  the  results  obtained  in  a  rapid  compression 

machine [27, 28].

The A factor has been divided by 2. 
Rate constant taken equal to that proposed for toluene [24] multiplied by 4. 
The  rate  constant  of  this  bimolecular  initiation  with  oxygen  molecule  has  been  calculated  as  proposed  by 
Ingham et al [47] : A is taken equal to n x 7x1011 cm3.mol-1s-1, where n is the number of benzylic hydrogen atoms 
abstractable, and the activation energy to the reaction enthalpy. 
Rate constant taken equal to that of the similar reaction in the mechanism of the oxidation of toluene [24] multiplied 
by 2 to take into account the number of abstractable H-atoms or of methyl groups. 
Rate constant taken equal to that of the similar reaction in the mechanism of the oxidation of toluene [24]. 
Rate constant taken equal to that proposed for benzene [11] multiplied by 2. 
Rate constant deduced from that of the similar reaction in the case of p-xylene and the difference in enthalpies of 
formation between the ortho and para isomers of xylylene [41]. 
Rate  constant  taken  equal  to  that  of  the  recombination  of  •H  atoms  with  alkyl  radicals  as  proposed  by 
Allara et al. [48]. 
Rate constant taken equal to that of the similar reaction in the case of toluene or benzyl radicals and derived radicals 
[24]. 
Rate constant taken equal to that of the similar reaction in the case of 1,3-butadiene [33].

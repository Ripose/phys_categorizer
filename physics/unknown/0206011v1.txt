Abstract.  The  concept  of  definability  of  physical  fields  is  introduced  and  a  set-theoretical 
foundation  is  proposed.    We  derive,  from  a  null  postulate,  a  nonlinear  sigma  model  and  then 
show that quantization is necessary and sufficient for definability of the model.   

 

We  look  to  provide  a  deep  connection  between  the  foundations  of  physics  and 

mathematics based on the concept of “definability”.  The foundation for mathematics is the set 

theory called Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF).  In ZF, a set U of finite integers is definable if and only if 

there exists a formula ΦU(n) from which we can unequivocally determine whether a given finite 

integer n is a member of U or not.  That is, when a set of finite integers is not definable, then 

there will be at least one finite integer for which it is impossible to determine whether it is in the 

set or not.  Other sets are definable in a theory if and only if they can be mirrored by a definable 

set of finite integers.  Most sets of finite integers in ZF, indeed most sets, are not definable. 

In a set–theoretical foundation for physical fields, a field is definable if and only if the set 

of distributions of its energy among its eigenstates (which is the set underlying thermodynamics) 

can be mirrored in the theory by a definable set of finite integers.  This concept of definability is 

appropriate  because,  were  there  a  physical  field  whose  set  of  energy  distributions  among 

eigenstates  was  mirrored  by  an  undefinable  set  of  finite  integers,  that  field  would  have  some 

energy  distributions  whose  presence  or  absence  is  impossible  to  determine.  To  avoid 

indeterminancy, we shall invoke a set theory in which all sets of finite numbers are definable and 

show this theory can provide a foundation for physical fields such that all fields are definable. 

Neither ZF nor any of its extensions can provide the required theory, because the set of 

definable  sets  of  finite  integers  is  itself  not  definable  in  ZF,  as  there  are  infinite  sets  of  finite 

integers whose definability is undecidable. [1] Our only recourse is to find a suitable sub-theory 

of  ZF  without  infinite  sets  of  finite  integers.    Then  all  sets  of  finite  integers  are  ipso  facto 

definable.  This will mean that the set of all finite integers, usually called ω, cannot exist in the 

sub-theory.    The  set  ω  exists  in  ZF  directly  as  in  consequence  of  two  axioms:  an  axiom  of 

infinity and an axiom schema of subsets.  Then we must delete one or the other of these axioms.  

If we delete the axiom of infinity we also have no need for the axiom schema of subsets since all 

sets  are  finite  and,  furthermore,  that  theory  is  not  rich  enough  to  be  a  foundation  for  physics.  

Thus,  the  task  reduces  to  whether  or  not  we  can  find  a  suitable  set-theoretical  foundation  for 

physical fields by the deletion of the axiom schema of subsets from ZF.   

In the appendix we show eight axioms.  The first seven are the axioms of ZF except that 

the axiom schema of replacement has been modified.  The usual replacement axiom (AR) asserts 

that for any functional relation, if the domain is a set, then the range is a set.  That axiom actually 

combines two independent axioms: the axiom schema of subsets, which asserts we can establish 

subsets non-constructively by means of a formula, and an axiom schema of bijective replacement 

(ABR),  which  gives  replacement  only  in  one-to-one  mappings.    We  have  deleted  the  axiom 

schema of subsets from ZF by substituting ABR for AR, forming the sub-theory ZF–AR+ABR.  

To understand first how ZF–AR+ABR differs from ZF, we look at the axiom of infinity.  

The  axiom  of  infinity  asserts  the  existence  of  infinite  sets  ω*  which  contain  both  finite  and 

infinite members.  In ZF, to obtain the set of just all the finite members, the set ω, we must use 

the axiom schema of subsets to establish the existence of the intersection of all the sets created 

by the axiom of infinity.  It has been shown that no model of ZF–AR+ABR contains ω [2]. 

This result confirms that the axiom schema of subsets is not hidden inside other axioms 

and implies that every theorem holds for any ω*.  Accordingly, we are at liberty to pick an ω* 

and refer to all members of that ω*, finite and infinite, as “integers”.  Infinite integers are one-to-
 
2 

one  with  ω*.    Finite  integers  are  the  non-infinite  members  of  ω*.    They  are  represented  in 

expressions below by i, j, k, l, m, M or n. 

We shall now adjoin to ZF–AR+ABR an axiom requiring that all sets are constructible.  

By constructible sets we mean sets that are generated sequentially by some process, one after the 

other, so that the process well-orders the sets.  Goedel [3] has shown that an axiom can be added 

to ZF giving a theory, called ZFC+, in which there are no sets other than those constructible sets 

proven to exist.  In the theory ZF–AR+ABR, we know that only countably many constructible 

members of the power set of ω* can be proven to exist. [4] Accordingly, the eighth axiom in the 

appendix asserts the power set of ω* is countable and its members, thus all sets, are constructible.  

We refer to these eight axioms as theory T. 

Since  only  countable  sets  exist  in  T,  the  continuum  hypothesis  is  formally  satisfied.  

However, T is not ω-consistent, that is, we cannot construct infinite sets by induction as we can 

do in ZF.   We have a theory in which all sets of finite integers are finite, in contradistinction to 

ZF  where  we  have  sets  of  finite  integers  that  are  infinite.    It  follows  that  every  infinite  set  of 

integers in T (and we do have such sets) contains infinitely many infinite integers.  As expected, 

Cantor’s proof cannot be carried out in T. [5]    

We  shall  now,  quickly  and  without  rigor,  develop  a  “constructible  mathematics”  in  T.  

First, recall the usual definition of the “rational numbers” as the set of ratios of any two integers 

of the set ω.  We can here likewise define for ω* the set of ratios of any two of its integers, finite 

or infinite, as an “enlargement” of the rational numbers, which we call Q*. [6] Two members of 

Q* are “identical” if their ratio is unity.  We employ the symbol “≡” for “is identical to”.  An 

“infinitesimal”  is  any  member  of  Q*  “equal”  to  0,  that  is,  letting  y  signify  the  member  and 

employing the symbol “=” to signify equality, y = 0 ↔ ∀k[y < 1/k].  Any member of Q* is either 

 

3 

equal to 0 or “finite”, that is, y ≠ 0 ↔ ∃k[1/k < or ≡  y].  We apply this notion of equality to the 

difference  between  members  of  Q*.    Thus,  any  two  members  of  Q*  are  either  equal  or  their 

difference  must  be  finite.    Finally,  we  can  arbitrarily  choose  any  infinitesimal  and  establish  a 

subset of Q* containing the products of that infinitesimal with each and every integer, finite and 

infinite.  Since x ≡ y ∧ y = w → x = w, every member of Q* is equal to at least one member of 

this subset.  We call this subset of Q* the “constructible reals”, signify it by R*, and use R* to 

create functions of real variables. 

We define an equality-preserving bijective mapping φ(x,u) between the members of R* in 

the finite intervals X and U, where x ∈ X and u ∈ U, as a “function of a real variable” in T, that 

is, ∀x1,x2,u1,u2 [φ(x1,u1) ∧ φ(x2,u2) → (x1 = x2 ↔ u1 = u2)].  Such functions can be shown to be 

biunique and continuous.  Constants are obtained from ABR.  Other functions of a real variable 

are  constructed  from  the  biunique  pieces  and  the  constants.    This  construction  can  be  written: 

φ1(x,u) ∨ φ2(x,u) is a function of a real variable having the domain X1 ∪ X2 and the range U1 ∪ 

U2 if and only if ∀x1,x2,u1,u2 [φ1(x1,u1) ∨ φ2(x1,u1) ∧ φ1(x2,u2) ∨ φ2(x2,u2) → (x1 = x2 → u1 = u2)], 

where φ1(x,u)  and φ2(x,u)  are  functions  of  a  real  variable  or  constant.  The  functions  of  a  real 

variable  closed  with  respect  to  both  differentiation  and  integration  are  just  the  polynomials. 

Infinite series cannot be completely summed in T.  Nevertheless, using polynomials, solutions to 

an eigenfunction problem are obtained arbitrarily closely by iteration.

An iteration generating increasingly higher order polynomials will converge uniformly to the 

eigenfunction piece, as the finite ∆λ between successive iterations decreases monotonically. 

This constructible mathematics leads intrinsically to a theory of strings.  Let us consider 

two  eigenfunctions,  u1(x1)  and  u2(x2);  for  each  let  p  ≡  1,  q  ≡  0  and  r  ≡  1  and  we  shall  call  x1 

“space” and  x2 “time”.  We observe that the quantity λ1-λ2 multiplied by u1

2u2

2 is the familiar 

Lagrange  density  of  the  simplest  bosonic  string,  from  which  the  field  equation  is  obtained  by 

Hamilton’s  principle,  that  is,  by  minimizing  its  integral  over  all  space  and  time.    We  can 

generalize now to a theory of strings in finitely many space-like (i) and time-like (j) dimensions, 

e.g., extensions of the Klein-Gordon and Schroedinger equations.

Then let us assume that α∈R*, α is non-negative and the set of all α is closed with respect to

any integer and ι is fixed,

Now the P and Q are in general functions of any of the xi and xj and thus any of the Ψlm as well.  
 
With equations (3), this constitutes a nonlinear sigma model that is solvable by iteration [7].  
 

The  model  holds  in  finitely  many  space-like  and  time-like  dimensions.  We  shall  treat 

only the case, however, of the model with a single time dimension.  Here the unit ι is associated 

with the irreducible time-eigenfunction pieces and called “action”.  Let ϑ be the time-period and 

nm be the number of cycles of the mth eigenfunction.  We define “energy in the mth eigenstate” as 

the integral number of units of action, i.e., the number of irreducible biunique pieces, of the mth 

eigenfunction per unit time.  Thus the energy in the mth eigenstate occurs in quanta of 4ιnm/ϑ.  

The “field energy” is the sum of energies in all of the eigenstates, 4ιM/ϑ, where M is ∑ jmnm and 

jm is the integral number of quanta in the mth eigenstate.     

We have set the stage for determination of the definability of the model in the theory T.  

Recall that every set (in T) of finite integers is finite and thus definable as that term has meaning 

in  mathematical  foundations.    So  a  physical  field  is  definable  in  T  if  and  only  if  the  set  of  all 

distributions of its energy among the eigenstates can be mirrored by a set (in T) of finite integers.  

We show now the model with a single time dimension is definable in T for any finite energy:   

 

6 

Given  a  field  energy  4ιM/ϑ,  each  ordered  set  of  jm  corresponding  to  each  different 

distribution of energy among all the eigenstates can be mapped to a different finite integer, e. g.,

where Pm is the mth prime starting with 2.  The set of such finite integers will always exist in T.  

This means that, for any finite field energy, quantization is sufficient for definability in T.  We 

can also show necessity if we look at the model classically.  Given the finite field energy 4ιM/ϑ, 

if ι were infinitesimal, then the integer M would have to be infinite.  In that case, the set of all 

distributions of energy  among  eigenstates cannot be mirrored by a set (in T) of finite integers.  

Therefore, quantization is necessary and sufficient for definability in T. 

    Finally, in seeking a foundation for physical fields such that all fields are definable, we 

began by invoking, instead of the usual foundation for mathematics ZF, a constructible theory T.  

In  T  we  derived  quantization,  from  which  we  indeed  obtained  definable  fields.    Now,  could 

quantization  also  lead  to  definable  fields  in  ZF?    No,  because  equations  (3),  the  statement  of 

quantization,  is  not  consistent  with  ZF.    Therefore,  since  only  theories  like  ZF  or  T  contain 

enough mathematical power for physical fields, T appears essential for the definability of fields.  

While a non-rigorous development of the mathematics of T is only provided here, the program 

seems clear and its implications for a theory of strings sufficiently interesting to merit attention.

The axiom schema of subsets is ∃u[(u=0∨∃xx∈ u) ∧∀xx∈ u↔x∈ z ∧ Χ (x)], where z is 
any set and X(x) is any formula in which x is free and u is not free. The axiom enters ZF 
in AR but can also enter in the strong form of the axiom of regularity. (Note that T has 
the  weak  form.)    This  axiom  is  essential  to  obtain  the  diagonal  set  for  Cantor's  proof, 
using  x∉f(x)  for  X(x),  where  f(x)  is  an  assumed  one-to-one  mapping  between  ω*  and 
P(ω*). In ZF, the argument leads to the contradiction ∃c∈zX(c) ↔ ¬X(c), where f(c) is 
the diagonal set, thus denying the mapping exists. In T, the same argument instead denies 
the existence of the diagonal set, since its existence must be assumed while the mapping 
is  asserted  as  an  axiom.    One  can  attempt  an  alternate  proof  using  ABR  to  get  a 
characteristic function. Let φ(x,y) ↔ [X(x)↔y = (x,1)∧¬X(x)↔y =(x,0)], z = ω* and w 
= ∪∀x∈ω*{(x,1),(x,0)}.  If c were a member of ω*, t = (c,1) and t = (c,0) both lead to a 
contradiction.  But, since the existence of the diagonal set f(c) is denied by axiomatizing 
a one-to-one mapping between ω* and P(ω*), as f(c) cannot be a member of P(ω*) so c 
cannot  be  a  member  of  ω*.    Therefore,  in  T  the  characteristic  function  has  no  member 
corresponding to a diagonal set. 

This  set  was  created  without  using  an  axiom  schema  of  subsets.  We  use  an  axiom  of 
sums and ABR instead.  It provides the table for arithmetic division of integers. Tables 
for addition, subtraction and multiplication can be created likewise.

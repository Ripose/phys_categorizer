Abstract.    I  detected  a  very  strong  (25  %var)  period  of  3592±57  years  at  99%  confidence  level  in  the 
10Be  deposition  rates  from  Vostok,  Antarctica  ice-core  raw  (gapped,  unaltered)  data.  The  period  was 
verified  at  99%  confidence  level  against  the  10Be  concentration  raw  data  at  both  Vostok–as  3700±57 
years  at  very  strong  38  %var,  and  Taylor  Dome,  Antarctica–as  3800±61  years  at  very  strong  23  %var. 
The noisy Mg concentration data from Taylor Dome also show an extremely strong (44 %var) period of 
3965±16  years.  The  Vostok  data  also  show  the  Hallstadzeit  Solar  cycle,  as  2296±57  years  at  12  %var, 
perhaps  its  best  estimate  yet.  I  use  for  all  analyses  the  99%-confidence  strict  Gauss-Vaníček  spectral 
analysis (GVSA) that estimates periods in incomplete records. Thus, the use of raw data is regarded as 
the criterion for a physical result’s validity, so data were not altered in any way, e.g., corrected for solar 
screening.  Instead,  data  separation  was  done  at  2  x  10^5  atoms/cm^2/year  (for  deposition  rate)  and 
0.95  x  10^5  atoms/gram  of  ice  (for  concentration  dataset)  cutoffs  reflecting  cosmic-ray  background 
conditions  at  the  Galactic  boundary.  After  the  separation,  only  the  discovered  period  remains  and 
converges: 3378±103 at 19 %var and 3346±85 years at 25 %var respectively, while the Hallstadzeit Solar 
cycle vanishes in both datasets. Hence, the discovered ca. 3400-years period appears to be of Galactic 
and extrasolar origin. Since the dominant cyclic peaks in  10Be raw data can only be explained by rapid 
excesses  in  the  atmospheric  cosmic-ray  influx  (and  not  by  noise  contribution),  the  discovered  period 
could  mean  a  signature  of  severe  instant  disturbances  (bursts)  occurring  regularly  in  an  apparently 
single  Galactic  extrasolar  source  of  cosmic  rays.  Based  on  recent  500-parsec  Galactic  Center  (GC) 
GeV/TeV  γ-ray  surveys  by  the  H.E.S.S.  and  INTEGRAL  telescopes,  the  GC  extremely  active  central 
region  makes  the  best  candidate-host  for  such  bursts.  A  previously  reported  3600-years  period  in 
geomagnetic  field  declinations  could  support  this  conclusion  by  indicating  that  the  discovered  phase 
could perhaps overpower entire astronomical magnetic fields, even at distances close to GC-Earth.  I also 
estimate using GVSA-specific features the epoch of the most recent 10Be maximum on Earth as 1085±57 
CE,  coinciding  with  the  1054–1056  CE  historical  account  by  Asian  astronomers  of  a  sky  explosion 
believed/disputed to mean the Crab supernova SN1054 event. I predict the next maximum raw  10Be on 
Earth in year 4463±57 CE, indicating that the current climate change is not cosmogenic, thus allowing 
for the conventional (anthropogenic) view. Due to claimed relatively long exposure to significant energy 
rise, on the order of decades, and the exposure’s relatively short recurrence period coinciding with the 
collapse of several ancient civilizations (ca. 2300 BCE), the extinctions (ca. 9000 BCE) and the glacial 
maximums  (around  20000  BCE),  it  may  be  possible  that,  if  real,  such  recurring  Galactic  bursts  could 
affect the Earth climate significantly.

1. Introduction 
 
Climatology  relies  heavily  on  spectral 
analyses  for  modeling  and  paleoclimatic 
studies.  Bard  and  Frank  (2006)  give  a 
good  overview  of  research  on  the  Sun 
radiation  as 
for 
the  main 
significant  changes  in  geoclimate.  But  if 
significant  variations  in  Earth  climate  are 
cosmogenic,  some  other  sources  aside 
from  the  Sun,  primarily  the  Galactic  ones 
could  (also)  be  responsible 
for  such 
changes.

Usually  records  of  various  proxies 
are  used  to  draw  conclusions  on  past 
atmospheric conditions. For instance, it is

commonly  held  that  the  relatively  stable 
radioactive  isotope  Beryllium  10  (10Be) 
with  a  half-life  of  1.6  million  years  is 
cosmogenic,  i.e.,  created  by  irradiation 
when  cosmic  rays  (carbon,  nitrogen, 
oxygen  and  other  nuclei,  i.e.,  particles 
charged with very high energy, 100GeV to 
1015 eV) collide with helium and hydrogen 
ions  as  the  rays  travel  through  Space. 
Thus, the 10Be is believed not to have been 
created  together  with  the  most  of  the 
Universe matter; this could explain why its 
in  situ  concentrations  are  evidently 
minute. Hence, the  10Be found on Earth is

2002). Many theoretical studies of galactic 
sources  of  the  cosmic  rays  have  been 
undertaken  since  LaViolette  (1983,  1987) 
first  proposed  Galactic  Centre 
(GC) 
explosions as a cause for climatic changes 
related  observational 
on  Earth.  The 
studies of TeV γ-ray sources in our galaxy 
have  gained  an  impetus  over  the  last  few 
years  with  the  low-energy-threshold  (100 
GeV)  H.E.S.S.  telescope  array  (Benbow, 
2005,  Aharonian  et  al.,  2006,  2005),  the 
INTEGRAL 
telescope  array  (Bélanger, 
2006) and other telescope GeV/TeV γ-ray 
surveys of the central 500 parsec region of 
the  GC.    The  GC  is  interesting  for  such 
studies  as  it  is  the  most  unusual  part  of 
our  galaxy  (Morris  and  Serabyn,  1996). 
One  of  the  achievements  of  the  ground-
based  γ-ray  astronomy  since  its  inception 
in  2002  is  the  recognition  of  the  GC  as  a 
TeV  γ-ray  source  (Hofmann,  2005),  with 
more than 30 γ-ray sources detected so far 
using  the  H.E.S.S.  telescope  (Benbow, 
2006).    One  of  the  most  favored  models 
for  galactic  sources  of  high-energy  cosmic 
rays  has  been 
shock 
remnants

(SNR),  e.g.,  Aharonian  (2004).    However, 
there  are  serious  issues  even  with  that 
model 
the 
detection of a supernova SN 1006 emitting 
no significant γ-rays over its entire field of 
view, as well as a possibility of a new class 
of  cosmic  accelerators  perhaps  driven  by 
shock  winds  of  massive  objects  emitting 
TeV energy (Hofmann, 2005).

10Be.    An  important  contributor  to  the 
error budget is reliability of the timescales 
used.  In  fact,  there  are  so  many  different 
dating methods and consequently as many 
timescales  derived  in  climatology,  that 
Monnin  et  al.  (2004)  have  called  into 
question  the  whole  dating  approach.    The 
main problem with present methodologies 
in  climate  science  lays  in  a  common 
approach  to  data  treatment  and  spectral 
analyses: “let us prepare data so that data 
satisfy  limited  abilities  of  the  classically 
used  Fourier  spectral  analysis  (FSA)  and 
its  derivative  methods”.  Drawbacks  of 
classical approaches – such as the need to 
boost signal in very long records – require 
severe  alterations  of  data.  For  example, 
researchers  often  invent  data  in  order  to 
make  their  analysed  record  equispaced, 
the  equispacing  requirement  being  the 
main  disadvantage  of  the  Fourier-derived 
methods.

remarkable  how  easy 
is  for  many 
researchers  nowadays 
to  decide  pro

data.  In  this  way  they  unavoidably  alter 
many  of  the  unknown  yet  intrinsic  data 
relationships  and  distributions.    This  is 
one  of  the  most  serious  issues  of  all 
modern  science.  As  a  consequence,  this 
issue  forces  researchers  to  rely  on  ever-
complex  algorithms.  The  data  alteration 
problem  has  made  observational  physical 
sciences diverge from modeling the nature 
on  to  modeling  the  human  errors  in 
understanding the nature, instead.

Quite  opposite,  I  regard  the  use  of 
raw  (gapped  and  unaltered)  data  as  the 
criterion  for  a  physical  result’s  validity.  I 
then  show  that  climatology  desires such  a 
new  philosophy  to  data  treatment  and 
analysis,  already  demonstrated  as  useful 
in  general  (Omerbashich, 
for  science 
2006).  This, a perfectly natural approach 
which  regards  raw  data  as  the  key 
criterion for a physical claim’s validity, can 
hopefully be greeted by climatologists who 
are  forced  to  work  with  so  many  polluted 
and  unreliable  data  records,  with  time

Until  1950  CE,  when  significant  amounts

cannot be confirmed by the analysis of the

the  same  data, 

As  would  be  the  case  with  all  time 
scales  used 
the 
LaViolette  (1983)  time  scale  has  a  varied 
reliability, too. I later modify that scale (in 
which  relative  10Be  production  rate  was 
normalized to the Holocene average value) 
by  boosting  no  peaks  in  data,  contrary  to 
what  many  researchers  do  using  solar 
screening  models  to  correct  for  solar 
screening  effects  during  the  Holocene 
period of enhanced solar activity. Another 
way  of  determining  what  the  relative 
cosmic  ray  intensities  would  be  outside 
the  solar  system  is  as  follows:  perform  a 
data  separation  on  raw  data,  rather  than 
editing the data or restricting the analysis 
to the time period when the peaks are high 
such  as  during  the  ice  age  periods  but 
excluding  the  interglacial.  Namely,  one 
can  never  understand  inherently  gapped 
data or portions of such data, so well as to 
be  certain  that  data  alterations  applied  to 
correct  known  issues  will  not  introduce  a 
slew  of  new  (unknown)  issues,  rather. 
Analogously,  no  other  parts  of  the  time 
series  have  been  corrected 
for  solar 
screening,  not  even  during  interstadial 
intervals  since  there  is  a  lack  of  data  to 
apply a model.  Going along the reference 
timescale  used, 
the  coral  chronology 
developed  by  Bard  et  al.  (2004,  1990) 
allows  corrections  as  far  back  as  about 
20–30 kyr, but for earlier dates there is no 
certain  way  how  to  correct  the  14C  values 
since  there  are  no  dendrochronology  or 
carved  sediment  scales  available  to  go  by 
times  beyond  about  20  kyr  (a 
for 
conservative  estimate).  Dates  from  about 
20–70  kyr  BP  were  based  on  14C  but  they 
are  not  as  reliable  as  the  earlier  ice-core 
dates  since  the  amount  by  which  the  14C 
dates  should  be  corrected  is  not  known. 
The ice core dates from about 70 kyr to 14 
kyr  BP  are  based  on  the  K/Ar  dates  and 
therefore  are  considered  the  least  reliable 
in  the  record.    An  alternative  timescale 
was also checked at the end, which was an 
update of LaViolette (1983) scale based on 
findings  by  Henderson  and  Slowey 
(2000).  However,  that  timescale  returned 
non-converging results.

3. Spectral analysis 
 
The  raw  10Be  data  were  analysed  in  the 
Gauss-Vaníček Spectral Analysis (Vaníček, 
1969,  1971)  that  fits  in  the  least-squares 
sense  data  with  trigonometric  functions. 
Magnitudes  of  GVSA  spectrum  peaks 
depict  the  contribution  of  a  period  to  the 
variance of the time-series, of the order of 
(some) % (Vaníček, 1969). As a result, and 
being based on variance as the most direct 
measure  of  noise, 
the  G-V  spectra 
generally  depict  background  noise  levels 
linearly,  which  gives  the  GVSA  a  full 
physical  meaning  making  it  a  preferred 
technique  for  studying  physical  processes 
and  fields  simultaneously  (Omerbashich, 
  In  addition,  periodicity  from 
2006). 
incomplete  records  is  estimated  down  to 
accuracy  prescribed  by  data,  i.e.,  to  the 
last  reliable  digit  of  data  values,  so  that 
only  general  reliability  (precision)  of  the 
input  data  is  superimposed  onto  the  G-V 
spectrum.  At  the  same  time,  GVSA  high 
precision  depends  only  on  the  spectral 
resolution,  which  however  can  be  chosen 
at  will.    Given  its  character  of  a  general 
optimizer, 
will 
least-squares 
outperform  the  labeled  reliability  of  data 
that it fits most of the time, by as much as 
statistical 
90%.  The 
analysis  in  GVSA  is  both  intuitive  and 
straightforward, while computer execution 
time 
little 
preprocessing  and  no  post-processing 
required.  The  GVSA  has  been  in  use  for 
over  35  years,  mostly  in  astronomy  but 
also in geophysics, medicine, finances, and 
so  on.  Taylor  and  Hamilton  (1972)  and 
have  more 
Omerbashich 
(2003) 
information  on 
including 
(blind)  performance  tests.  The  GVSA 
outperforms  Fourier  spectral  analysis 
when  studying 
long 
records of natural data (Press et al., 2003; 
Omerbashich,  2006),  such  as  the  data 
used here.

is 

A  peak  in  the  G-V  spectrum  is  well 
resolved  when  it  is  resolved  from  both 
sides  (slopes);  meaning  if  the  spectrum 
ascends  immediately  (in  a  nearly  straight 
fashion)  from  zero  to  the  maximum  (the 
spectral  peak),  and  without  retaining  its 
maximum  for  longer  than  one  spectral 
point continues on to descend in the same 
manner towards zero. The accuracy of the 
period's least-squares estimate in case of a 
well-resolved  peak  can  be  obrtained

uniformly  for  the  entire  dataset;  it  equals 
the declared accuracy of input data, taken 
over  the  data  density  (as  data  time-span 
over  number  of  data  input  values).  Note 
that  any  labeled  uncertainties  in  the  G-V 
periods'  estimates  must  not  be  taken  at 
their face-value, as raw data obviously are 
noise-contaminated.  So 
in  reality  the 
uncertainties  could  be  up  to  several  times 
greater  than  what's  labeled,  but  this  is 
empirical. 

As it can be seen from Fig. 3, the G-V 
period  estimates  converge  rapidly  with 
magnitude-of-order  increase  in  spectral 
resolution.  Since 
computations  with 
spectral  resolution  on  the  order  of  2·105 
spectral  points  can  put  a  burden  on 
computing capabilities, I subsequently use 
the  2·104  points-resolution  all  through. 
Note  that  the  estimate  precision  stays  on 
the order of (some) years when going from 
2·104  to  2·105  points-resolutions.    Note 
that  the  Vostok  data,  Table  1,  for  the 
period between 0 and 19 kyr BP are more 
densely sampled with samples taken every 
3 to 13 m, whereas after that the sampling 
interval was for the most part every 25 m. 
However,  one  should  not  worry  about  the 
sample 
its 
denser 
beginning,  Table  1,  given  the  very  small 
number  of  values  over  such  a  long  span 
anyway. 
  Unless  otherwise  stated,  the 
band  of  interest  for  this  analysis  is  400–
40 000 years.

The strongest detected period in 10Be

period  estimate  #3  of  2296±57  years 
represents  the  best  estimate  yet  of  the 
Hallstadzeit  Solar  cycle,  to  the  best  of  my 
knowledge.  The  Hallstadzeit  cycle  has 
been

anywhere  between  2000–2500  years, 
both  in  ice  core  10Be  studies  and  in  tree

see,  e.g.,  approximate 
estimates  by  Tobias  et  al.  (2004),  Sonett 
(1990) and Sonett and Finney (1990).  The 
above  excellent  estimate  of  this  period  is 
no coincidence since raw data are used as 
the only criterion of validity, together with 
an analysis method that can accommodate 
that  norm  in  an  optimal  way  (least-
squares  fit).  Note  that  the  Hallstadzeit 
cycle  estimate  worsens  somewhat  albeit 
not  significantly,  when  G4  scale  is  used, 
see Table 3.  The period estimate #1, Table 
2, has been reported also from the 150-kyr 
long  Vostok  10Be  record,  though  as  a 
coarse  “5  kyr”;  see  Liritzis  and  Gregori 
(1997).    No  periods  #4  and  #5,  Table  2, 
have  been  reported  previously  to  the  best 
of  my  knowledge.  These  could  be 
connected  to  the  multi-century  cooling 
episodes  known  to  have  occurred  every 
1500±500  years  during  the  Holocene;  see 
a review by deMenocal (2001). 

increase 

is  some 

The Vostok  10Be deposition rate raw 
data  show  no  significant  periods  at  19 
000,  40  000  or  100  000  yrs.    LaViolette 
(1983,  1987)  claimed  that  a  ca.  12500  yrs 
period would be the strongest in 10Be data. 
There 
in  the  G-V 
spectrum  of  10Be  deposition  rate  raw  data 
at  around  12500  yrs,  but  it  is  too  unclear 
and  low  to  be  called  a  period.  Besides, 
given  that  the  Vostok  data  span  is  only 
~140  kyr,  it  makes  no  sense  to  claim 
anything  longer  than  1/4  of  that,  i.e.,  ~35 
kyr  or  so.  In  this  paper  I  discuss  the 
strongest period found, ca. 3600 years. 

The  peaks 

in  G-V  spectrum  of 
Vostok data on the G4 time-scale do seem 
well  resolved  from  both  sides  and  very 
sharp,  with  underlying  background  noise 
suppressed,  Fig.  4.    But  it  seems  as  if  the 
creators of the G4 timescale were worried 
more  about  details  but  missed  the  big 
picture.  The  12  500  yr  period  appearance 
is  most 
to  precession 
modulation.  Note  certain  deterioration  in 
the estimate of the Hallstadzeit cycle when 
the G4 timescale is used.

climate  variability 

The  10Be  raw  data  from  ice-cores  at 
Greenland  do  not  show  any  significant 
peaks  as  the  raw  record  is  obviously 
burdened  by  long-periodic  noise,  Fig.  5, 
perhaps due to a higher snowfall rate than 
in  Antarctica  or 
climate 
variability on sub millennium scales. Note 
in 
however 
Greenland  and  Antarctica  do  not  seem  to 
differ  significantly  on  millennium 
to 
decadal  scales  (Mayewski  et  al.,  1996). 
First  reliable  studies  on  Greenland-
Antarctica  snowfall  and  other  glacial 
variability are underway by ITASE project 
(Mayewski  and  Goodwin,  1996). 
  In 
addition,  a  southerly-directional  influx  of 
extreme  cosmic  radiation  could  have 
further  helped  make  natural  periods 
remain buried inside the extreme levels of 
in  the  Greenland 
long-periodic  noise 
record. 

Beer  et  al.  (1987)  did  not  perform 
analysis  on  the  Holocene  part  of  the  Byrd 
ice core.  Their data begins at around 9200 
years  BP.    No  sensible  results  could  be 
obtained using those data.

The  10Be  concentration  raw  data 
reveal no periods longer than 5503 yr, and 
there 
is  no  a  ~3600  yr  period.  
Empirically,  GVSA  can  discern  a  period  if 
the total data span is at least four-to-eight 
times  that  period  under  ideal  conditions 
(noise  absent).  However,  most  of  the 
variance  was  absorbed  by  the  detected 
widely  spread  40-kyrs  period  (under  99% 
confidence) 
empirical 
that 
requirement  does  not  necessarily  apply.  
The  40-kyrs  period  is  here  recognized  as 
the  39  200  years  obliquity  according  to 
Berger's  equations  (Berger  and  Loutre, 
1992).  Enforcing  the  39  200  yr  period  in 
the  Vostok  data  lowers  the  strength  of  all 
the  periods  considerably;  however  the 
data  span  is  too  short  for  the  data  to

the  period  is  now  in  30-40%var  range, 
while  the  Taylor  signal  are  in  20-30%var

of  background  noise 
(Omerbashich,  2006)  that  the  underlying

It should be expected (see section 2. 
Data)  that  the  Vostok  Beryllium-10  data 
are  at  least  not  less  reliable  than  Taylor 
Dome  data;  although  the  periods  doubled 
they still are not any better resolved. Quite 
contrary:  there  seems  to  be  a  background 
process  seen  as  the  degree  of  unresolved 
range of periods, in %var, i.e., from 0 %var 
to  some  %var,  that  goes  up  in  the  same 
manner  as  the  longest-periodic  portion  of 
the  band  of  the  drawn  periods  does.  So

about 1% of that of the proton cosmic rays 
which  for  protons  is  3·10-2  ergs/cm2/s 
(Ramaty, 1974; Fig. III-15). The other 99% 
is  the  cosmic  ray  proton  background, 
which  is  mostly  of  extragalactic  origin  in 
that  it  is  isotropically  distributed.  These 
are  particles  emitted 
from  explosive 
activity  that  long  ago  took  place  in  other 
galaxies.  So  the  marker  10Be  deposition 
rates  that  prevail  during  the  Holocene 
interval of about 0 to 10 kyr BP and during 
the  previous  Eemian  interglacial  would 
reflect  times  when  the  background  was 
almost  entirely  of  extragalactic  origin. 
Small  (weaker)  waves  might  be  present 
but  they  would  be  lost  in  the  background 
noise. Since cosmic ray electrons are much 

 
less efficient producers of 10Be and since it 
is  believed  to  be  a  significant  solar-
screening  effect  by  the  heliopause  sheath, 
the  cosmic-ray  burst  wave  component 
might have to raise almost 105 fold before 
it  would  be  possible  to  even  see  it  above 
the 
extragalactic  proton  background 
signal.    Subsequently,  LaViolette  (1983) 
proposed that a Galactic burst wave exists 
so energetic as to be able to rise to a peak 
of  3·105  times  the  current  cosmic  ray 
electron  background,  hence 
to  90 
ergs/cm2/sec,  as  well  as  (p.233)  that  this 
wave  peak  electron  intensity  would  have 
risen  to  75  times  the  current  cosmic-ray 
proton  background  (after  taking 
into 
account  solar  modulation).  So,  during 
quiescent  times  when  the  burst  wave 
cosmic-ray electron intensity was less than 
the current cosmic ray proton background, 
the 
extragalactic  proton  background 
would have been the principle cause of the 
10Be production.

source  of  the  3400-yrs  period  is:  (a) 
extrasolar,  because  there  exists  a  (any)

number  of  points  (after  separation,  that

opted for 99% as the minimum confidence 
level under these circumstances, i.e., given 
the  kind  of  data,  uncertain  timescales, 
noise pollution, etc.

I  next  analysed  just  the  current 
quiescent  period  from  0  to  11,000  years 
BP  to  see  if  the  3400-years  period  is 
absent.  If  the  peak  values  of  a  galactic 
burst wave are for the most part below the 
background,  and  this  period  is  associated 
with  the  burst  wave,  then  it  shouldn't  be 
seen during this more recent interval.  The 
first  11  kyr  of  the  Vostok  10Be  deposition 
rate raw data contains 35 values. GVSA of 
that portion in 400-5500 yrs band reveals 
a 614-years as the only period at both 99% 
and  95%  confidence.    On  the  other  hand, 
after the data separation the first 11 kyr of 
the  at-and-above-cutoff  raw  Vostok  data 
contains  only  5  values.  GVSA  of  that 
portion  in  400-5500  yrs  band  reveals  no 
significant  period  at  either  99%  or  95% 
confidence. There is a bulge at about 450-
650 years but this can be declared a period 
only  based  on  the  above  analysis  of  seven 
times  denser  data,  not  based  on  statistics 
as  five  is  insufficient  for  the  optimal 
number  of  input  values.  Therefore,  based 
on  statistics  and  rather  insufficient  data, 
there  is  no  3600  (3400)  years  period  in 
the 
last  11,000  years  of  the  Vostok 
recorded 10Be chronology.

To  finally  check  the  possible  effects 
of  the  climatic  changes  I  have  picked 
magnesium  as  a  crustal  dust  indicator, 
from  the  Taylor  Dome  core.  These  data 
should  reflect  climatic  changes  such  as 
wind  speed,  continental  dryness  and 
others,  which  affect 
the  amount  of 
airborne dust.  The results of the GVSA of 
Mg raw data from Taylor Dome are shown 
in  Table  9.    Note  that  in  addition  to  the 
periods  listed  in  Table  9  that  are  of 
interest to this study, such as the 3965±16 
yr,  many  shorter  periods  were  also  found 
with  99%  confidence  in  the  400-114000 
yrs  band,  but  this  was  because  the  99% 
confidence level went all the way down to 
just  0.3  %var.  It  appears  that  Mg  records 
are  far  more  sensitive  to  short-term 
climatic  disturbances  than  the  10Be  are. 
From the analysis of the Mg data it can be 
seen  that  the  longest  periods  have  the 
largest  magnitudes,  but  also  that  they  are 
"riding" 
unspecified 
background  noise  of  up  to  25  %var,  but 
which  obviously  was  not  enough  to  burry 
them  beyond  recognition.  This  is  a  good 
example  of  the  fact  that  one  should  not 
read  magnitude  strengths  in  the  GVSA 
literally, but only in the context of the data 
analysed  and  the  physical  process  those 
data  are  (un)known  to  be  sensitive  to.  
This is related to what I have noted earlier: 
in  absolute  terms,  the  result  that  the 
magnitudes  of  longest  periods  from  10Be 
concentration  data  appear 
the 
magnitudes from 10Be deposition rate data 
does not mean this is the output one wants 
to use as an argument. On the contrary, it 
means that there are issues with the input 
data  but  those  issues  are  unimportant  in 
that  in  both  cases  longest  periods  found 
exceeded the 99% confidence level.

Based  on  using  the  GVSA  and  its

timescales  should  not  represent  a  big

4. Epoch estimate 
 
In order to estimate the epoch of the most 
recent  increase  in  atmospheric  10Be,  I 
make use of the unique feature that GVSA 
variance  spectra  depict  background  noise 
levels 
relative 
linearly.  This  enables 
determination of field  dynamics  as shown 
in  (Omerbashich,  2006).  It  also  enables 
relative  determination  of  the  effect  of 
dataset size on the periods’ estimate. This 
makes  the  G-V  spectrum  an 
indirect 
measure  of  signal’s  relative  strength  as 
signal-to-noise  ratio  varies.  Basically,  one 
slides  the  data  series  for  some  random 
small  number  of  years 
(timestamps 
permit),  say  350  years  in  our  case,  then 
869,  then  1224,  then  254,  etc.    If  the 
period  estimate  increases  at  any  of  these 
values,  despite  the  input  dataset  being 
shortened,  it  means  that  at  that  moment 
(datum)  the  so  edited  data  are  fit  by  the 
maximum  number  of  cycles  possible 
(maximal  S-to-N  ratio), 
the  so 
shortened record is almost precisely at the 
beginning  (datum)  of  a  whole  dominant 
 
 

i.e.,

cycle. One repeats this procedure as many 
times  as  it  makes  sense  physically,  i.e., 
until  the  record  is  shortened  so  much  to 
extinguish  completely  the  contribution  of 
the  period  to  variance  as  found  in  the 
original dataset. Then one simply averages 
all  so  obtained  estimates  of  the  strongest 
period  in  data  made  when  the  period  was 
the  data  actually 
increasing  despite 
shortening. 
  Obviously,  this  procedure 
gives  better  results  the  higher  the  data 
density. In our case this means going more 
than  two  full  dominant  cycles  in  the  past 
to  make  three  matches.  Simple  averaging 
of these three values yields an estimate of 
the  last  epoch  of  increased  10Be  on  Earth 
as  1085±57  CE.    The  results  of  the  epoch 
estimate are summarized in Table 10.  The 
above  described  procedure 
can  be 
laborious, so selecting datum shifts should 
be  performed  in  an  as  random  fashion  as 
possible;  the  likelihood  of  obtaining  any 
estimate  of  the  last-occurred  epoch  drops 
dramatically  if,  say,  systematic  datum-
shifting is employed instead, see Table 11.

Average epoch CE:          N/A

Curiously,  counting  back  from  year 
1085  CE  epoch  estimates  are  obtained  for 
the historical increases in 10Be level, Fig. 7, 
where the prediction of the next maximum 
epoch  falls  in  year  4447  CE.    I  use  my 
period’s  mean  value  of  3362  years 
obtained  after  the  data  separation,  Tables 
7  &  8.  The  projected  values  are  seen  on 
Fig.7  as  approximately  matching  some 
notable  climate-change  events  such  as 
those  reported  by  Jessen  et  al.  (2005),  as 
well  as  the  related  historical  events.  For 
instance, the 2227 BCE epoch matches the 
Akkadian (Mesopotamian) Empire sudden 
collapse  in  the  late  Holocene  around 
2220±150 BCE caused by extreme cooling 
(deMenocal,  2001)  and  the  Old  Egypt 
Kingdom  sudden  collapse  around  2240 
BCE  caused  partly  by  Sahara  drying  up 
due to global cooling (Street-Perrott et al., 
2000).  Then,  the  1085  CE  epoch  matches 
the  Tiwanaku  (Bolivian-Peruvian)  Empire 
collapse  at  around  1100  CE  (deMenocal, 
2001).  Finally,  the  9001  BCE  epoch 
matches  the  Late  Pleistocene  extinctions 
of  thousands  of  species  including  land-
vertebrates such as most of the mammoth 
genus  at  some  11  000  years  ago;  recent 
radiocarbon  dating  rejected  most  of  the 
alternative  theories  on  these  extinctions

the  beginning  of  the  decline  of  the 
Wisconsin and Pinedale glacial maximums 
at  around  20  000  years  ago  (Flannery, 
1999).    I  note  in  the  end  that  the  initially 
predicted  1085  CE  epoch,  which  matches 
seemingly  well  with  the  ancient  Asian 
observation  of  a  remarkable  sky  event,  in 
terms  of  historical  climatic  changes  also 
appears  to  match  the  start  of  the  most 
extreme  conditions  of 
the  Northern 
Hemisphere’s  Medieval  Warm  Period 
around  1000  CE  (Cook  et  al.,  2004,

5. Discussion 
 
to  Stephenson  and  Green 
According 
ten  reliable  eyewitness 
(2005),  some 
accounts  have  been  found  in  the  records 
covering the past two millennia, on what is 
believed 
supernovae 
explosions.  These  records  come  from 
ancient  Arab,  Chinese,  Japanese,  Korean, 
North  American  natives’,  as  well  as  other 
eastern  and  western  sources.  The  most 
famous  of  these  is  a  Chinese  historical 
account  of  a  naked-eye  observation  of  an 
extraordinary  sky  phenomenon  that  had 
occurred  on  4-5  July  1054,  dubbed  “a 
guest star” by the ancient eyewitnesses. It 
lasted  visibly  for  some  650  days  at  night, 
of  which  23  days  in  the  daylight  as  well 
(Sollerman 
  Some 
astronomers  proposed  that  the  event 
represented  a  supernova  explosion,  the 
SN1054  remnant  of  Crab  nebula  with  its 
Crab pulsar in particular. The Crab nebula 
is one of the best-studied objects in the sky 
(ibid.).  It  is  not  only  the  brightest  optical 
remnant in the sky, but is also marked by 
the  most  energetic  pulsar  in  the  Galaxy.  
However,  according  to  Peng-Yoke  (1962) 
of  Cambridge,  western  knowledge  or 
the  ancient  Asian 
comprehension  of 
astronomical  records  appears  to  be  quite 
limited.  In  addition,  Peng-Yoke  et  al. 
(1972) have raised serious issues about the 
claiming 
of 
specific 
unconditionally  that  it  did  not  mean  an 
observation  of  the  Crab  nebula  at  all.  For 
instance,  (ibid.) 
inspected  an  ancient 
Chinese  text  indicating  that  the  “guest 
star” appeared as large as the Moon, which 
greatly exceeds the normal angular size of 
any known supernovae. Also, Sollerman et 
al.  (2001)  have  shown  that  the  Crab 
supernova  did  not  contain  enough  mass 
(Ni)  to  allow  it  to  burn  for  almost  two 
years.  Alternative  explanations  proposed 
by  (ibid.)  and  earlier  by  Chevalier  (1977) 
would  require  that,  in  the  sense  of  mass-
energy  conversion  modelling,  the  Crab 
nebula be unique in the entire Universe.  I

Furthermore, 

galactic 
supernovae explosions, as described in the 
historic  accounts 
the  past 
millennium, cannot all be accounted for by 
using  what 
is  known  on  galactic 
supernovae  rates,  e.g.,  Van  Den  Bergh 
(1991)  and  Donder  and  Vanbeveren 
(2003).  Since  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  all 
of  the  unaccounted-for  historic  accounts 
meant  naked-eye  observations  of  the 
outer-galactic  supernovae, 
leaves 
room  for  alternative  galactic  explanations 
in  case  of  at  least  some  of  the  above-
mentioned  historical  accounts.    However, 
for lack of alternative reasoning that could 
perhaps  explain  the  vast  amounts  of 
energy obviously witnessed in 1054, many 
contemporary  astronomers  still  refer  to 
the  1054  event  as  the  Crab  nebula 
explosion.

Beside  the  optical  domain,  energy 
released 
from  a  supernova  explosion

to 
supernovae explosions still set a threshold 
for  this  study.  Specifically,  since  the 
energy released from a galactic supernova 
explosion  evidently  does  leave  terrestrial 
signatures at the atomic  scales (ibid.), the 
considerably  higher  energy  emissions 
from the past GC burst could have affected 
the  10Be  records,  so  much  that  in  fact  the 
period of such a regular event becomes the 
strongest period  in  all  of the ice-core  10Be 
data  available,  as  was  the  case  with  ca. 
3400-years period discovered here.

6. Conclusions 
 
I  showed  that,  based  on  using  raw  data 
only,  many  of  the  differing  approaches  to 
time  scale  definition  of  core  samples  not 
only  give  erroneous  results  according  to 
the  main  criterion,  but  are  also  hardly 
necessary  at  all:  whatever  10Be  dataset  or 
timescale one uses, the GVSA produces (or 
not)  more  or  less  the  same  periods,  in 
most  cases.    This  also  holds  true  for 
elements  other  then  Beryllium  as  well, 
such as Magnesium (Mg).  Using raw data 
as  the  most  physical  approach  possible 
possibly  remarkable  features  are  revealed 
in  the  long-periodic  (400–40  000  yr) 
band  of  most  of  the  (10Be)  ice-core  raw 
datasets:  they  are  strongly  and  clearly 
periodic  with  a  ca.  3400  (3600)  years 
phase previously unreported, while known 
periods  such  as  the  Hallstadzeit  Solar 
cycle were estimated to the highest degree 
of  accuracy  and  confidence  yet. 
  The 
timescale  used  here  as 
the  marker 
generally gave satisfactory results, such as 
one-on-one  data  separation  v.  results 
separation,  the  dominant  period  above 
99%  all 
the 
timescale  or  data  density  used,  the  pre-
separation  v.  post-separation  difference 
between  two  data  representations  seen  as 
almost  for  an  order  of  magnitude  smaller 
than  from  the  full  raw  dataset,  a  curious 
match  with  significant  climate-related 
historical  events,  and  so  on.  The  same 
timescale,  when  updated  according  to 
Henderson  and  Slowey  (2000)  produced 
rather distorted results, such as seven new

10Be  maximum  on  Earth 

After  data  separation  at  the  cutoffs 
background 
reflecting 
conditions  at  the  Galactic  boundary,  it 
appears  that  the  discovered  period  could 
represent  a  possible  signature  of  cosmic 
bursts  occurring  regularly  probably  in  the 
Galactic Center (GC) mid-half kpsc region. 
A  previously  reported  3600-years  period 
in  geomagnetic  field  declinations  perhaps 
can support this conclusion. Using GVSA-
specific  features  the  epoch  of  the  most 
recent 
is 
estimated  as  ca.  1085.  Given  that  it  takes 
several decades for the 10Be to accumulate 
in 
to 
presently detectable levels, this epoch falls 
remarkably  close  to  the  1054–1056  CE 
historical account by Asian astronomers of 
an  enormous  sky  explosion.    I  predict  the 
next  maximum  level  of  the  10Be  on  Earth 
in year 4463±57 CE.  Should that happen, 
to 
due 
significant  energy  rise  and  the  exposure’s 
relatively  short  recurrence  period,  it  may 
be  possible  that  recurring  Galactic  bursts 
affect the Earth climate significantly. Then 
the  next-epoch  prediction  would  indicate 
that  the  current  climate  change  is  not

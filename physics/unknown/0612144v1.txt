Abstract 
We explore possibilities of improving the spatial structure of NOx emissions employed in a continental scale 
chemistry transport model (CTM) by using satellite measurements of nitrogen dioxide and ground-based 
observations of near surface ozone. In this study, we combine the tropospheric NO2 columns derived from 
SCIAMACHY measurements, the data from the EMEP ozone-monitoring network and the calculations performed 
with the CHIMERE CTM in the framework of an advanced inverse modelling scheme. All data used in the study 
correspond to the period of June-August 2003. The main distinctive feature of our inversion scheme is that, in 
contrast to more common inverse modelling approaches, the magnitudes of uncertainties in the input data are not 
explicitly predefined but rather estimated consistently with the (cid:147) a posteriori(cid:148) emissions as a result of the inversion. 
While the tropospheric NO2 columns are used for (cid:147) fitting(cid:148) the spatial distribution of the emission parameters of the 
model, the ozone observations are only used to estimate the averaged levels of uncertainties in (cid:147) a priori(cid:148) emissions. 
We use our method in order to estimate and to reduce uncertainties in the gridded (with the resolution of 1 degree) 
NOx emission data for Europe, Middle East and Northern Africa. It is found that the (cid:147) a priori(cid:148) emission estimates 
used in the standard version of CHIMERE are probably biased in several regions. In particular, the total emissions 
from both anthropogenic and biogenic sources are probably, overestimated for Great Britain, Belgium, the 
Netherlands, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Bulgaria, Greece, and Iraq, but mostly underestimated for Spain, Italy, 
Switzerland, Czechia, Former Yugoslavia, Turkey, Lebanon and Iran. The emission correction factors are typically 
inside of the range from 0.5 to 2. On average, the uncertainties in total NOx emissions are estimated to be about 1.7 
in terms of the geometric standard deviation in Europe and about 2.1 outside of Europe. The corrected emission 
estimates provide better agreement of the modelled results with observations for both NO2 columns and near surface 
concentrations of ozone.

Introduction 

It  is  widely  recognized  that  the  ability  of  atmospheric  models  to  represent  the  current state and to predict possible 
future  changes  of  the  chemical  composition  of  the  atmosphere  depends  crucially  on  the  quality  of  available 
information  regarding  sources  (emissions)  of  atmospheric  pollutants.  One  promising way for validation of available 
emission  inventories  and  for  elaboration  of  improved  emission  data  involves  inverse  modeling  of  sources  of 
atmospheric  gases  (see,  e.g.,  Enting,  2002).  In  this  way,  observational  data  are  used  as  constraints  to  emission 
parameters of an atmospheric model. 
 A strong impetus to the atmospheric inverse modeling studies has been given by recent remarkable progress in 
satellite measurements of the composition of the lower atmosphere. Indeed, it seems reasonable to believe that data 
for tropospheric column amounts of such important trace gases as NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, HCHO derived from almost 
global satellite measurements (e.g., Burrows et al. 1999; Eisinger and Burrows, 1998; Velders et al. 2001; Richter 
and Burrows, 2002; Buchwitz et al., 2004; Bowman, 2006) bear significant useful information on sources of these 
gases. Attempts to extract and to use this information have already been undertaken in several studies. In particular, 
tropospheric NO2 columns derived from GOME measurements have been used for estimation of total NOx 
emissions on the global scale (Leue et al., 2001; Martin et al., 2003; M(cid:252)ller and Stavrakou, 2005) and on the 
regional scale (Konovalov et al., 2006), as well as for estimations of NOx emissions from different kinds of sources 
such as lightning (Boersma et al. 2005; Beirle et al., 2006), ships  (Beirle et al., 2004, Richter et al., 2004) or soils 
(Jaegle et al., 2004, Bertram et al., 2005). Satellite measurements have also been used to improve emission estimates 
for carbon monoxide (PØtron et al., 2004, Yurganov et al., 2005) and isoprene (Visconti et al., 2005).  
In this study, we use satellite measurements performed by the SCIAMACHY satellite instrument (Bovensmann et 
al., 1999) in order to estimate and reduce uncertainties in available data for NOx emissions. More specifically, we 
consider spatially distributed NOx emission data employed in the CHIMERE continental scale air quality model 
covering Europe and the Middle East. A continental scale model allows us to resolve finer spatial scales than those 
usually considered in global inverse modelling studies. The combination of satellite data with an air quality model 
and data of ground-based air pollution monitoring in this study is expected to contribute to developing synergy 
between regional air pollution studies and observations of the chemical composition of the atmosphere from space.

A main idea underlying atmospheric inverse modelling studies is to adjust emission parameters of a model such that 
model results would demonstrate closer agreement with observations. However, in doing so it is necessary to keep 
in mind that both the model and measurements are imperfect. Accordingly, it is crucial to insure that fitting of 
emissions does not result in compensation of model and measurement biases that are actually not related to 
uncertainties in emission data. Otherwise, the fitted emissions may even be more uncertain than available emissions 
estimates. A common way to avoid this undesirable scenario is to use a probabilistic approach that usually involves 
a combination of (cid:147) a priori(cid:148) information on the considered emissions and information derived from measurements 
using a model (e.g., Enting, 2002). The (cid:147) weights(cid:148) of these sources of information relate to uncertainties in the a 
priori estimates, model and measurement errors. Although these weights are recognised to be crucial parameters of 
inverse modelling schemes (Kaminski, 1999; Heimann and Kaminski, 1999), they are usually assigned in a rather 
arbitrary way as a kind of (cid:147) expert estimates(cid:148). However, neither model errors, nor uncertainties in available emission 
inventories are ever known sufficiently well. It is useful to note, in particular, that while overall uncertainties in the 
model can be judged by considering differences between model results and measurements, it is necessary to take 
into account that these differences actually include both model errors caused by uncertainties in emissions and all 
other model errors. Different parts of the model errors may, in principle, covariate or anti-covariate making separate 
estimation of these parts of uncertainties difficult or, perhaps, even impossible. The uncertainties in satellite data 
concerning the chemical composition of the lower atmosphere are also difficult to quantify, since they result from a 
rather complex retrieval procedure that involves important a priori assumptions regarding vertical profiles of the 
species concentration, aerosol and cloud properties. Although the attempts to estimate uncertainties in satellite data 
or emission inventories using the error propagation technique (see, e.g., Boersma et al, 2004; K(cid:252)hlwein et al., 2000) 
are undoubtedly useful, these studies also involve explicit authors(cid:146) assumptions about the magnitudes of the 
uncertainties in input data used either in their retrieval procedure or in the respective emission inventory. 
It has been suggested recently (Konovalov et al., 2006) that the uncertainties mentioned above can be estimated 
consistently within the inverse modeling scheme. In other words, it has been proposed that the parameters of the 
corresponding probability distribution functions can be treated as internal rather than external parameters of the 
inversion scheme. To implement this idea, the inverse modeling scheme involved independent measurements of 
different characteristics (ground based in addition to satellite measurements); that allowed deducing optimal values 
of uncertainties in model results, measurements and a priori emissions. In the given study, the previously proposed 
methods are substantially advanced. The major distinctive features of this study are (i) the use of ground-based 
measurements of near-surface ozone concentrations (instead of NO2 concentrations as in the previous study) for 
calibration of uncertainties in the input data of the inversion scheme and for validation of the a posteriori emission 
estimates, (ii) the use of the SCIAMACHY measurements that feature much higher spatial resolution than the 
GOME measurements used in the previous study, (iii) independent treatment of uncertainties in anthropogenic and 
biogenic emissions, and (iv) extension of the inversion scheme over a much larger area including all of Europe, the 
Middle East, and Northern Africa. Note that the method used in our previous study was mainly designed for the 
relatively high level of anthropogenic air pollution typical for Western Europe, while the method proposed here is 
more general. Note also that the use of ozone measurements instead of NO2 concentrations is advantageous for the 
following reasons: first, the concentration of near surface ozone is certainly more decoupled from the tropospheric 
NO2 column than the NO2 near surface concentration; this reduces the probability of error covariance in two kinds 
of the respective modeled data. Second, the available ozone measurements suitable for this study are much more 
abundant than respective measurements of nitrogen dioxide. 
The paper is organised as follows. The modelled and measured data are discussed and compared in Section 2. Our 
inversion scheme is described in Section 3. The results of the inversion and the improvements in the model 
performance are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 summarises the results of this study. 
 

2  Measurement and model data 

2.1 

Satellite data 

We use the data for tropospheric NO2 columns derived from measurements performed by the Scanning Imaging 
Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric ChartograpHY (SCIAMACHY) on board of the Envisat satellite. These 
data are scientific products of the University of Bremen. SCIAMACHY is a passive remote sensor covering the 
wavelength range from 240 and 2380 nm with a spectral resolution between 0.2 and 1.5 nm (Bovensmann et al., 
1999). The NO2-columns have been retrieved using measurements in the spectral window from 425 to 450 nm 
where the resolution of the instrument is about 0.4 nm. Although SCIAMACHY operates in both nadir and limb 
modes, only measurements performed in the nadir mode have been used to retrieve NO2 columns for this study. The 
typical horizontal resolution of the instrument in the nadir mode is about 30(cid:215)60 km2. ENVISAT flies in a sun 
synchronous near polar orbit with the equator crossing time in the descending node at 10:00 a.m. local time. Global 
coverage is achieved after 6 days. 

The  method  of  retrieval  of  tropospheric  NO2  columns  from  the  spectra  measured  by  SCIAMACHY is the same as 
described  by  Richter  et  al.  (2005).  Specifically,  tropospheric  NO2  columns  are obtained in several steps, including 
the  retrieval  of  slant  column  amounts  by  means  of  the  DOAS  (Differential  Optical  Absorption  Spectroscopy)

method,  the  estimation  of  the  stratospheric  part  of  the  slant  columns  using  the  daily  stratospheric  NO2  columns 
simulated  by  the 3d-CTM SLIMCAT (Chipperfield, 1999) for the time of the satellite overpass, the cloud screening 
(removing  pixels  with  a  cloud  fraction  of  more  than  0.2  as  determined  by the FRESCO algorithm (Koelemeijer et 
al.,  2001)  and  the  evaluation  of  tropospheric  air  mass  factors  (AMF)  that describe the light path in the troposphere 
and  are  used  to  convert  the  tropospheric  slant  NO2  columns  to  vertical  columns.  The  vertical distribution of NO2 
needed for the evaluation of AMF is calculated with the MOZART-2 CTM (Horowitz et al., 2003).  
Note that the use of the NO2 vertical distribution simulated by MOZART (rather than CHIMERE itself) in the 
retrieval procedure allows us to assume that the random part of uncertainties in NO2 columns derived from satellite 
measurements and in those modeled by CHIMERE are statistically independent. This assumption is used in our 
inversion procedure. 

2.2 

Data of ground-based measurements 

We use measurements of near-surface ozone concentrations performed at the stations of the EMEP ground based 
monitoring network (http://www.nilu.no/projects/ccc/emepdata.html). Data for the period considered in this study 
(summer 2003) was available from 113 stations. Normally, the measurements are reported on hourly basis. 
However, for some stations, the data was incomplete and, therefore, some selection criteria were needed. We have 
taken into account only those days, for which the number of hourly measurements exceeded 16; the stations for 
which data were insufficient for more than 30 days have been excluded from the analysis. As a result, for the 
summer period of 2003 considered below, we have selected 110 stations. Unfortunately, only a few stations are 
located outside of Western Europe. The presence of large regions without routine ozone monitoring makes this 
study more difficult. Note that the important advantage of the EMEP measurements is that they are intended to 
reflect regional background conditions relatively unaffected by local emissions. A continental scale model can more 
adequately reproduce the ozone behaviour in such conditions than, for example, in big cities. The use of data from 
other monitoring networks (urban, regional, etc.) would seriously aggravate methodological problems concerning 
representativeness of measurements, data selection criteria and treatment of uncertainties. 

2.3 

Simulated columns and concentrations 

The CHIMERE CTM used in this study is described in detail in the technical documentation available on the web 
(http://euler.lmd.polytechnique.fr/chimere/). A general description of CHIMERE can also be found in literature (see, 
e.g., Schmidt et al., 2001; Vautard et al., 2001, 2003; Beekmann and Derognat, 2003; Bessagnet et al., 2004). We 
outline below only a few major features of our modelling system.  
The CHIMERE domain used in this study extends from 12°W to 65°E and from 29°N to 62°N. It covers all of 
Europe, the Middle East, and a part of Northern Africa with the horizontal resolution of 1°×1°. The extension of 
CHIMERE beyond Western Europe is discussed in Konovalov et al. (2005). In the vertical, the model has 8 layers 
defined with the hybrid coordinates. The top of the upper layer is fixed at the 500 hPa pressure level. Meteorological 
input data are calculated off-line with horizontal resolution of 100×100 km2 using the MM5 non-hydrostatic meso-
scale model (http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/). MM5 is initialised with NCEP Reanalysis-2 data 
(http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/wesley/ncep_data/). A simplified chemical scheme (MELCHIOR2) used in 
this study includes 44 species and about 120 reactions (Schmidt et al., 2001; Derognat, 2002). Lateral boundary 
conditions are specified using monthly average values of chemical species concentrations simulated by the 
MOZART model (Horowitz et al., 2003).  
The data for anthropogenic emissions for NOx, SO2, CO, and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) 
used in this study are specified using the EMEP data distributed to 11 Selected Nomenclature for Air Pollution 
(SNAP) sectors and gridded with the horizontal resolution of 50x50 km. The annual EMEP data for 2003 together 
with data provided by IER, University of Stuttgart (GENEMIS, 1994) are used to define daily, weekly, and seasonal 
variations of anthropogenic emissions. The data for total NMVOC emissions are split into 9 reactivity classes 
represented in the model mechanism taking into account typical VOC profiles for different activity sectors 
(GENEMIS, 1994) and following classification of hydrocarbons with regard to their structure and reactivity 
(Middleton et al., 1990). Note that CHIMERE does not take into account emissions from aircrafts. Such emissions 
are believed to provide rather insignificant fraction (1-2 %) of total anthropogenic emissions both on the global and 
European scales (e.g., Lee et al., 2005; Tarassόn et al., 2004). 
Biogenic emissions of isoprene and terpenes (the latter are affected to alpha-pinene in the chemical mechanism) are 
parameterised as fluxes dependent on local temperature and insolation (Guenther, 1995; Simpson et al., 1999). 
Parameterisation of biogenic emissions of NO from soil is based on data and methods of Simpson et al. (1999) and 
Stohl et al. (1996). The NOx emissions from lightning, which are probably not important for Europe, are not taken 
into account. The average rates of anthropogenic and biogenic emissions calculated in CHIMERE are shown in Fig. 
1. 
In this study, CHIMERE is used to simulate tropospheric NO2 column amounts and near surface ozone 
concentrations for the summer months (June-August) of 2003. The choice of summer months has been motivated by 
the fact that this study is aimed at improving simulations of photo-oxidant pollution which is largest during the 

 

3

warm season. Besides, the shorter lifetime of NOx during the warm season facilitates a technical solution of the 
inverse modelling problem, as discussed in Section 3.4. In order to be consistent with satellite data, the modelled 
NO2 columns are taken for each model grid cell at the time nearest to 10 A.M. of the local solar time only on those 
days for which satellite data are available. The daily data for the simulated NO2 columns were then averaged over 
three summer months. Note that in contrast to tropospheric NO2 columns derived from satellite measurements, NO2 
columns simulated by CHIMERE do not include nitrogen dioxide from the upper troposphere. Although this 
omission may cause systematic biases in the simulated NO2 columns, it has been found earlier (Konovalov et al., 
2005) that the omitted part of the tropospheric NO2 can hardly contribute significantly to the spatial variability of 
tropospheric NO2 columns. The potential systematic biases are taken into account in our inversion procedure as it is 
specified below (see Section 3). 

When  model  results are used in combination with ground-based observations, it is necessary to define a model level 
that  corresponds  to  a  given  station.  The  choice  of  the  surface  layer  may  be  inappropriate  for  mountain sites where 
the  model’s  grid  cannot  resolve  details of a relief. We chose an appropriate model level by considering the difference 
between the actual height of a site (a.s.l.) and its height in the MM5 model topography. 

2.4 

Initial comparison of simulations with measurements 

2.4.1  NO2 columns 

The tropospheric NO2 columns derived from the SCIAMACHY measurements in comparison with the NO2 columns 
calculated  by  CHIMERE  are  shown  in  Fig.  2.  As  expected,  CHIMERE  yields  somewhat  smaller, on the average, 
NO2  columns  than  satellite  measurements.  In  order  to  eliminate  systematic  differences  between  the  simulated  and 
measured  NO2  columns  from  further  analysis,  we  have  preliminary  evaluated  them  using  a  running  average 
technique.  Specifically,  we  first  arranged  the  measured  NO2  columns  for  each  grid  cell in ascending order and then 
evaluated  the  differences  of  the  modelled  and  measured  NO2  columns  within  a  moving  window  that  includes  100 
grid  cells.  These  calculations  were  performed  separately  for  three  big  regions  marked  in  Fig.  2b,  which  will  be 
referred  to  by  convention  as  Western  Europe,  Eastern  Europe  and  the  Afro-Asian  region.  The  results  of  such 
analysis  are  shown  in Fig. 3. It is seen that the differences increase with increasing magnitudes of the NO2 columns. 
This  means  that  the  systematic  errors  in  NO2  columns  are,  predominantly,  of  multiplicative  character.  The 
considered  systematic  differences  may  include  errors  in both measured and modelled data. In particular, a part of the 
differences  may  be  due  to  omission  of  the  upper  troposphere  in  the  model,  but  another  part  may  also  be  due  to 
underestimations  of  the  NOx  emissions  or  the  air  mass  factors  used  in  the  retrieval  procedure  of  the  satellite 
measurements.  The  modeled  NO2  columns  with  the  added  systematic  differences  are  shown  in  Fig.  2c  and  the 
scatter  plots  of  the  measured  NO2  columns  versus  the  modelled  ones  before  and  after  debiasing  are  presented  in 
Fig.4.  Obviously,  the  unbiased  NO2  columns  from  CHIMERE are significantly closer to the NO2 columns derived 
from  satellite  measurements  than  the  original  NO2  columns  calculated  by  the  model.  Nevertheless,  the  remaining 
differences,  which  are  spatially  random,  are  still  rather  considerable;  a  part  of  these  differences  may  be  due  to 
uncertainties in emissions. 

2.4.2  O3 concentrations 
Results of the initial comparison of the simulated and measured near surface ozone mixing ratios are presented in 
Fig.5 for each EMEP site in terms of standard comparison statistics calculated for daily maximums of the ozone 
concentration. Specifically, we consider the root mean squared error (RMSE) normalised to the mean daily 
maximum ozone concentration at a given site and the correlation coefficient. The average values for these statistics 
are 0.23 (RMSE) and 0.63 (R). The correlation coefficient is higher than 0.6 for the majority of sites (73 out of 110 
considered), and higher than 0.8 for 18 sites. The RMSE is smaller than 0.15 and 0.25 for 14 and 74 stations, 
respectively. Relatively large values of the correlation coefficient are typical for Germany, Belgium, the 
Netherlands, and Great Britain, but generally smaller ones are found for the sites in Eastern and Northern Europe. 
This observation may be indicative of the fact that CHIMERE simulates temporal ozone variability best for the sites 
situated in rather polluted environments where ozone behaviour is determined mainly by the photochemical 
processes rather than by  long-range transport. Nonetheless, even when the model performs badly in terms of the 
correlation coefficient, it still may perform quite satisfactory with regard to normalized RMSE. For example, a very 
small correlation coefficient (0.17) and a rather low NRMSE (0.24) co-exist for the Shepeljovo station near 
Moscow. As it was argued by Konovalov et al. (2005), the quality of ozone simulations by CHIMERE is typical for 
state-of-the-art models. Although the calculations which we consider here were performed with lower resolution 
than in our previous studies (where the resolution was of 0.5°×0.5°), the level of the agreement between ozone 
simulations and EMEP measurements practically did not change.

Inversion scheme 

3.1 

Problem formulation 

As specified above, we have the datasets of the measured NO2 columns (Co) and near-surface ozone concentrations 
(So). We can obtain also estimates of the columns and concentrations calculated by the model as a function of 
emission rates, Cm and Sm. The NO2 columns considered here are the averages over three summer months. As to O3 
concentrations, we use their daily maximum values for each day during the considered summer season. The daily 
maximum values are expected to be more sensitive to changes of emissions than other possible characteristics of the 
daily ozone level (e.g., daily mean values or 8h-averages). We have also NOx emissions data (from emission 
inventories and the model emission interface) that are used below as a priori emission estimates (Ea); if not specified 
otherwise, these are the total mean emission rates from both anthropogenic and biogenic sources over the three 
months. All kinds of input data may differ from their true values with unknown errors. Our main task is to elaborate 
a posteriori emission estimates, Ep, that should be closer to the unknown true values of emissions than the a priori 
emissions. Another related task is to estimate uncertainties in the spatial distribution of a priori emissions. 

3.2 

Approach and basic assumptions 

We  find  a  solution  of  our  inverse  modelling  problem  using  the probabilistic approach (see, e.g., Tarantola, 1987). 
This  approach  is  commonly  used  in  geophysical  inverse  modelling,  including  inverse  modelling  of  sources  of 
atmospheric  trace  gases  (e.g.,  Enting,  2001).  In  accordance  to  this  approach,  we  treat  all considered characteristics 
as  random  values.  We  assume  that  errors  in  the  a  priori  emission data are multiplicative and satisfy the lognormal 
probability distribution. Accordingly, the natural logarithms of true emissions, e, satisfy the normal distribution:

where  N is the number of grid cells in the model domain, ea are the natural logarithms of the a priori emission rates, 
and  σe  is  a  vector  of  the  standard  deviations  for  errors  in  the  a  priori  emissions.  In  the  absence  of  more  specific 
information,  the  lognormal  distribution  is  believed to be most suitable in the case of strictly positive characteristics 
and  multiplicative  errors  (Mosegaard  and  Tarantola,  2002).  We  assume  also  that  errors  of  a  priori  emissions  for 
different grid cells are statistically independent. Taking into account that we do not know exactly uncertainties in the 
a priori emissions, the standard deviations σe are also considered as random values. 
In  case  of  NO2  columns,  we  cannot  assume  that  errors are strictly multiplicative, because previous studies (Richter 
and  Burrows,  2002;  Martin  et  al.,  2003;  Konovalov  et  al.,  2005)  have  shown  that  the  datasets  for  NO2  columns 
derived  from  satellite  measurements  also  contain  additive  errors.  Therefore, we cannot assume that the tropospheric 
NO2  satisfy  the  lognormal  distribution  in  a  general  case.  Instead,  we  assume  that  errors  in  both the measured and 
simulated  NO2  columns  satisfy  the  normal  distribution  with  parameters  dependent  on  the  magnitude  of  the  NO2 
columns. 

In the context of this study, it is most important to specify the constraints that the measured NO2 columns put to the 
emissions. Following Tarantola (1987), we combine the errors in the modeled and measured NO2 columns and, as a 
result, we obtain the following distribution for emissions constrained by the model and measurements.

where  δc  is  the  difference of the systematic errors in the measured and modeled NO2 columns, and σc is the standard 
deviation  of  the  combined  residual  errors  not  related  to  uncertainties  in  emissions.  In  the  absence  of  certain 
information  on  the magnitudes of σc, it is also considered as a random value. Note that formulation (2) assumes that 
the  model  and  measurement  errors  are  statistically  independent.  This  would  hardly  be  the  case  if  our  model  were 
used  in  the  retrieval  of  satellite  measurements.  The  distributions  (1)  and  (2)  describe  two  different  sources  of 
information  on  emissions.  The  next  reasonable  step  is to combine these sources in order to reduce the uncertainties 
in  both  kinds  of  the  emission  estimates.  When  the  uncertainties  in  the  a  priori  emissions  and  in  the  model  and 
measurements  are  statistically  independent,  such  combination  can  be  performed  by  multiplication  of  the 
corresponding  probability distribution functions. As a result, we get the following distribution for emissions that are 
constrained, on the one hand, by measurements, and, on the other hand, by data of emission inventories:

Note that the same distribution (3) could also be obtained using Bayes(cid:146)s theorem. 

If  we  knew  the  probability  distribution  functions  (PDF)  for  σc  and  σe,  we  could  integrate  (3)  with  the  weights 
defined  by  those  distributions.  In  doing  so,  we  would  eliminate  the  unknowns  from  the  PDF  for  emissions. 
However,  as  we  lack  information  on  the  distributions  of  σc  and  σe,  we  use  another  approach.  Specifically,  we 
consider a posteriori emission estimates that provide a maximum of the distribution (3) under the given values of the 
standard deviations. These maximum likelihood estimates, Œ, satisfy the following equations:

modeled NO2 columns in the given window, k is the index of grid cells inside the model domain and j is the internal 
index of a grid cell inside the window. Obviously, when Nw is sufficiently large, this variance characterizes total 
random (in the spatial sense) unbiased errors in the modeled and measured NO2 columns. Similarly, the standard 
deviation σc that characterizes a combination of the measurement error and a part of the model error, which is not 
caused by random uncertainties in emissions, relates to differences between the modeled and measured columns as

Assuming that the parts of the error in the modeled NO2 columns that relate and do not relate to uncertainties in 
emissions are statistically independent, we get the following approximate relation:

Given Δ e and Δ T, the relation (8) provides the estimate of the parameter σc. However, while the variance Δ T is 
evaluated directly using measured and modeled data, the variance Δ e, which quantifies the differences between NO2 
columns calculated with a priori and corrected (unknown) emissions, is to be estimated approximately. In order to 
better understand the meaning of Δ e, let us first assume that uncertainties in emissions in different grid cells are 
statistically independent and that the nonlinearity of the relationship between NO2 columns and NOx emissions may 
be neglected. After linearizing Eq. (7), we obtain the following relation between Δ e and σe:

This result demonstrates that when Δ e is estimated for a sufficiently large statistical ensemble, its magnitude depends 
mainly on the mean deviations of the a priori emissions from the true ones, rather than on the true emission 
explicitly. Accordingly, an idea of our estimation of Δ e is to substitute the unknown values of ec in Eq. (7) for some 
surrogate values defined such that the differences between the natural logarithms of the surrogate and a priori 
emissions would have the variance equal to σe
the natural logarithms of the true and a priori emissions). Taking into account that emission uncertainties in 
neighboring grid cells may be not completely independent, it is also important that the spatial structure (covariances) 
of the differences between the logarithms of the surrogate and a priori emissions would be similar to the spatial 
structure of the uncertainties in a priori emissions. In order to satisfy these conditions and taking into account that

Note that the a posteriori emissions Œ could not be used directly as a substitute for ec because the root mean squared 
differences between Œ and ea are smaller than the presumed uncertainties in the a priori emissions. On the other 
hand, we could not replace ec by randomly perturbed a priori emissions because in that way the probable spatial 
covariances of errors in the a priori emissions would be ignored. This could eventually lead to overestimation of σc 
and σe. 
After substituting ec in (7) for es, we get the following approximate relationship between σc and σe:

Note that since es depends on the solution Œ of Eq. (4), they depend both on σc and σe. 
We then take into account that the uncertainty in a priori emissions may depend on the magnitude of the emission 
rate in a given grid cell. In order to specify this dependence, we consider the differences between two different 
emission inventories, such as EMEP and POET (http://www.aero.jussieu.fr/projet/ACCENT/POET.php) for 
anthropogenic emissions, and also between soil NOx emissions calculated in CHIMERE and provided by the GEIA 
emission inventory (Yienger and Levy II, 1995). Both the EMEP and POET emissions were taken for the year 2000, 
since the POET NOx emissions were not available for more recent years. We define the logarithmic deviation D 
between the data e1 and e2 of a pair of different emission inventories as follows:  

                                                                                                                       (12)

Here we use again a windowing technique which involves the preselection of Nw grid cells with similar magnitudes 
of emission rates. Values of D calculated for both anthropogenic and biogenic emissions and for different regions 
are shown in Fig. 6. Assuming that the covariance of errors in data of different emission inventories are positive, 
these deviations can be considered as the lower limit of total uncertainties in both kinds of data. Evidently, that these 
uncertainties are quite considerable. It is interesting to note that somewhat in contrast to our intuitive expectations, 
the considered differences between emission data are not always smaller for Western Europe than for the other two 
regions. However, while interpreting the dependencies shown in Fig.6, it is necessary to take into account that 
values of D may be larger for one region than for another simply due to larger covariance of uncertainties in data of 
different emission inventories for the first region. The decreasing character of the dependence of D on the magnitude 
of the emission rate indicates that the relative uncertainty in emissions is probably largest for grid cells with small 
emission rates, while it is smallest for grid cells with large emission rates. We combine the uncertainties in 
anthropogenic and biogenic emissions as follows: 

,                                                                                                                            (13) 

where  Da  and  Db  are  the  logarithmic  deviations  defined  by  Eq.  (15)  for  anthropogenic  and  biogenic  emissions, 
respectively, and  

                                                                                                                                                (14)

are scaling factors defined with given average (for the whole region considered) values σa and σb of the standard 
deviations of a priori anthropogenic and biogenic emissions, respectively. N is the total number of grid cell 
considered for a given region. After substituting Eqs. (13) and (14) into Eq. (11), the latter enables estimation of σc 
as a function of two yet unknown scalar parameters σa and σb. 
Finally, we try to constrain values of σa and σb based on the idea that their optimal values should yield the best 
agreement between the model with a posteriori emissions and some independent measurements that have not been 
used for fitting the a posteriori emissions. In this study, we use measurements of near-surface ozone. It seems 
obvious that the uncertainties in the measured data for ozone concentrations and tropospheric NO2 columns can be 
considered as independent. Besides, the covariance of uncertainties in the modeled ozone concentrations and NO2 
columns is likely also small, because the behavior of these characteristics is driven by rather different physico-

 

7

chemical processes. Since both the measured and modeled ozone concentrations are, in our case, strictly positive, it 
is reasonable to assume that distributions of measurement and model errors in ozone concentration satisfy the 
lognormal probability distribution. Then, using Bayes(cid:146)s theorem, we can get the following probability distribution 
for σa and σb:

where so and sm are the logarithms of the observed and modeled daily maximums of ozone concentrations, k is the 
index of a monitoring station, Nk is the number of daily data for a station (cid:147) k(cid:148), and σs is the standard deviation of the 
unbiased combined error in the measured and modeled ozone concentrations. Here we assumed also that the a priori 
distributions of the logarithms of σa and σb are uniform (that is, there are no a priori constraints to their values). The 
maximum-likelihood (optimal) estimates of σa and σb should yield a minimum of the corresponding cost function, 
i.e. we are looking for a combination of σa and σb that yields a posteriori emissions in a way to minimize differences 
in the modeled and observed surface ozone:

It seems reasonable to assume that the combined error in ozone concentration is mostly not related to uncertainties 
in emissions. This assumption, which is found to be consistent with the results of this study, allows us to estimate σs 
as folows:

Taking into account Eqs. (11) and (13), the minimization of the function G (see Eq. (16)) yields optimal values of σa 
and σb along with the consistent estimates of uncertainties in NO2 columns σc. In other words, while equation (11) 
gives an estimation of σc under the given values of σa and σb (after substituting the relation (13) which translates 
overall a priori emission uncertainties into emission uncertainties for individual grid cells), the optimization of the 
agreement between modeled and measured ozone concentrations (Eq. (16)) gives the best estimates of overall 
uncertainties in a priori anthropogenic and biogenic emissions. 
Unfortunately, due to the lack of ground-based observations outside of Western Europe, the method described above 
cannot be fully applied to Eastern Europe and the Afro-Asian region. On the other hand, we cannot expect that the 
uncertainties in emissions are the same for all regions. Therefore, some less obvious assumptions about emission 
uncertainties outside of Western Europe are unavoidable. Specifically, we assume that the scaling factors ξ (see 
Eq.(14)) are the same for all regions. This assumption implies, for example, that if the EMEP data for Western 
Europe were found less uncertain than the POET data, they would also be expected to be less uncertain in the other 
regions. If the covariance of errors in the considered emission datasets is larger for the regions outside of Western 
Europe (that seems to be probable in view of results shown in Fig. 6), such an assumption may lead to 
underestimation of emission uncertainties in Eastern Europe and the Afro-Asian region. Therefore, we consider our 
estimates of emissions uncertainties in these regions as the lower limit of probable real uncertainties. Finally, we 
assume that the uncertainties in NO2 columns σc in Eastern Europe and in the Afro-Asian region are the same as in 
Western Europe. 

3.4 

Numerical method 

First of all, it is necessary to note that finding a mathematically precise solution of the inversion problem coupled 
with the problem of the estimation of uncertainties would, in our case, be extremely computationally expensive, 
taking into account that a single three-month run of our model takes about 10 hours on a standard PC. Therefore, we 
use approximate methods. The core of our method is the calculation of the modeled relationships between NOx 
emissions and NO2 columns or concentrations by substituting the original model with a set of linear statistical 
models describing the considered relationships approximately. In doing so, we assume that the typical range of 
transport of freshly emitted NOx is rather limited. This approximation was tested and used in our earlier study 
(Konovalov et al., 2006). Specifically, our statistical models are defined as follows:

where 

jα  are regression coefficients, which represent the sensitivity of the NO2 column in the grid cell i to a 
perturbation of the emission rate in the grid cell j, and M is the number of layers of the grid cells around the 
(cid:147) central(cid:148) cell i: the larger M is, the more distant transport of NOx is taken into account. The models are built using 

 

8

i

each of the model grid cells. Accordingly, the coefficients 

results of a sufficiently large number of model runs with pre-specified small random perturbations of emissions in 
jα  are obtained by solving a set of linear equations for 
relative perturbations of emission rates and corresponding responses of NO2 columns. Technically, the respective 
equations are solved using the SVD method (Press et al., 1992). The optimal number of (cid:147) random(cid:148) model runs 
depends on the desired accuracy, the effective distance of transport, and the nonlinearities in the real relationships 
between emissions and columns, but, importantly, it does not depend on the total number of grid cells as soon as the 
dimensions of the model domain exceed the typical range of NO2 transport. Similar to our previous study, we found 
it to be sufficient to consider the models with M equal 2 that have been built based on results of 100 model runs. 
Note that although this number is not small, it is, nevertheless, much smaller than the number of the emission 
parameters to be optimised, and, therefore, our method is very advantageous in terms of the computational demand 
when compared with the direct variational approach. Special tests described in Konovalov et al. (2006) show that, if 
the input data were perfect, our method could enable significant (up to 3 times) reduction of uncertainties in a priori 
emissions, while the maximum reduction of uncertainty with real (noisy) data was limited by uncertainties in input 
data. 
The numerical scheme includes several embedded optimisation procedures, which are outlined in Fig. 7. The 
optimisation procedure of the lowest level is aimed at finding a solution of Eq. (4) under given values of the 
standard deviations σc and σe. The solution is found by means of the steepest descent method using the a priori 
emissions as initial guess. Although the steepest descent method is not optimal in terms of the computational 
demand, it has been chosen because of its robustness and stability. One hundred iterations that are found to be 
sufficient to reach the minimum require only several seconds of CPU time. The optimisation procedure of the next 
level is intended for estimation of σc (by solving Eq. (11)) under given values of σa and σb. The solution is found by 
means of the simple iteration method with (cid:147) damping(cid:148) when values of σc obtained in the left-hand side of Eq. (11) 
are used at the next iteration to construct values σc in the right hand side of the equation. This procedure requires 
also about one hundred iterations. The optimization procedure of the highest level is intended for estimation of σa 
and σb using ozone observations by means of minimization of the cost function G (see Eq. (16)). Since the relations 
between NOx emissions and near surface ozone concentrations are essentially nonlinear and non-local, the repeated 
runs of the whole model are inevitable at this step. Considering the huge computational coasts of the exact solution 
of this two-dimensional minimization problem (note that we need a global minimum, while most of the (cid:147) automatic(cid:148) 
methods only ensure finding a local minimum closest to an initial guess), we find an approximate solution using a 
kind of a simplest (cid:147) global search(cid:148) method. Specifically, we perform an ensemble of model runs with a posteriori 
emissions corresponding to sets of fixed values of σa and σb. The set of values of σa includes the numbers from zero 
to 0.9 with equidistant steps of 0.1, while the set of values of σb consists of the following numbers: 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 
0.9, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0. We considered only such combination of all these possible values of σa and σb that satisfy 
to the condition σa< σb, as it seems reasonable to expect that uncertainties of biogenic emissions are larger than 
uncertainties in anthropogenic emissions. 

3.5  The Monte Carlo ex periment  

An inverse modeling study is traditionally expected to provide not only optimized a posteriori emissions but also 
estimates of their uncertainty. Besides, as soon as our estimates of uncertainty in a priori emissions may also be 
regarded as an important result of our study, it is useful to evaluate the accuracy of these estimates. In order to do all 
this, we employ the Monte Carlo method (see, e.g., Press et al. 1992). Specifically, we use the a posteriori emissions 
and corresponding modelled NO2 columns as surrogates for the true data and generate a number of sets of synthetic 
data 
 
eas=ep+Δ e, 
cos=cm(ep)+Δ c,                                                                                                                                                             (19) 
 
for the a priori emissions and the measured NO2 columns with (cid:147) errors(cid:148) Δ e and Δ c sampled from the probability 
distributions (1) and (2). After performing inversion with so defined synthetic data and considering the differences 
with the optimal a posteriori emissions, it would be easy to evaluate uncertainties in a posteriori emissions due to the 
presumed uncertainties in the NO2 columns and the a priori emissions. However, we should take into account that 
our knowledge of uncertainties in the input data is also not quite perfect. For example, an underestimation of the 
uncertainty in the a priori emissions would result in smaller corrections of the a priori emissions than it is actually 
required. And vice versa, the overestimation of the uncertainty in the a priori emissions would result in 
unrealistically large corrections to a priori emissions and attribution of part of the model and measurement error to 
uncertainties in emissions. Thus, in our opinion, this source of potential uncertainties in the inverse modelling 
results should also be taken into account. 
Because we estimate the uncertainty parameters of distributions (1) and (2) by optimising the agreement between the 
measured and modelled near surface ozone concentration, the uncertainty in these estimates may relate to the facts 
that (i) both the measured and modelled ozone data may be rather inaccurate, (ii) the amount of available ozone 

 

9

measurement data is always limited, and (iii) the spatial distribution of the a posteriori emissions is not perfect. 
Ideally, these sources of uncertainties could be taken into account in the same way as the uncertainties in NO2 
columns and NOx emissions. However, this way would be computationally too expensive, as it would require 
repeating the whole inversion procedure many times. Instead, we employ a simpler and more robust approach, 
which is based on the boot-strapping method (see, e.g., Efron et al., 1993). Namely, we repeat all the procedures 
described above but with randomly selected subsets of ozone monitors. Each subset included one third of the total 
number of ozone monitors in Western Europe. Therefore, in each experiment we deal with three independent subsets 
of ozone data. While systematic uncertainties in ozone measurement or modelled data are removed from analysis by 
debiasing (see Eq. (16)), it seems reasonable to expect that random uncertainties associated with each subset of 
ozone data are independent. Besides, as the location of different stations is different, the uncertainties in the spatial 
distribution of the a posteriori emissions can also be efficiently taken into account. The corresponding estimates of 
the standard deviations σa and σb of the a priori emissions are used (i) to assess the uncertainty in optimal estimates 
of σa and σb obtained with the whole dataset of ozone measurements and (ii) to generate (cid:147) synthetic(cid:148) data (19). These 
synthetic data corresponding to different subsets of ozone monitors are then combined and analysed in order to get 
final estimates of uncertainties in the a posteriori emissions. It should be noted that because each independent 
estimate of σa and σb in the Monte Carlo experiment is based on a considerably smaller amount of ozone data than 
the main estimation, it is very probable that the approach used here overestimates the uncertainties σa and σb. In 
turn, this overestimation may result in overestimation of uncertainties in a posteriori emissions. Therefore, we 
consider our estimates of uncertainties in a posteriori emissions and related parameters as the upper limits of their 
actual uncertainties. 

 

4  Results 

4.1 

Estimates of uncertainties in input data 

Let us first consider the estimates of uncertainties in a priori emissions obtained as a result of the optimisation 
procedure described above. The average values and uncertainties of the logarithmic standard deviations of the a 
priori emissions for different regions are given in Table 1. These estimates correspond to the scaling factors ξa=0.42 
and ξb=0.88 (see Eq. (14)). That is, the estimated uncertainties in both anthropogenic and biogenic emissions used in 
CHIMERE are, on average, smaller than the differences between data of different emission inventories. Note that 
the reported uncertainties in σa and σb for Eastern Europe and the Afro-Asian region should be considered as the 
lower limit of the actual uncertainties, because our estimates are based of the assumption that the scaling factors ξa 
and ξb for these regions are the same as for Western Europe. This assumption results, in particular, in significantly 
lower values of σb for Eastern Europe and the Afro-Asian region than for Western Europe. It is useful to take also 
into account that σa and σb are intended to characterize only the random part (in the spatial sense) of the total 
uncertainties in the a priori emissions. Because the structure of the land use is likely to be more homogeneous in less 
urbanized regions outside of Western Europe, the fraction of the systematic errors in emissions may be larger there 
at the expense the random errors. As to the presumable mean uncertainties in the anthropogenic emissions (σa), they 
are practically the same for all regions. As it is noted above, it is possible that values of σa for Eastern Europe and 
the Afro-Asian region used in this study are underestimated. The underestimation of σa (as well as of σb) may result 
in smaller corrections for a priori emissions in the respective region than actually needed. 
The estimated values of the standard deviation σc for uncertainties in NO2 columns are shown in Fig. 8. For 
comparison, we show values of the variance Δ T that characterizes the total random uncertainty in NO2 columns 
(including the uncertainties in the modeled NO2 columns due to errors in a priori emissions). We also show values 
of the variance Δ e, which estimates the part of the uncertainties in the model due to uncertainties in a priori 
emissions. As it is follows from our results, the magnitudes of uncertainties in NO2 columns caused by errors in 
emissions are very similar to the magnitudes of other uncertainties. Regarding the dependence of σci on the 
magnitude of the NO2 columns, it is useful to note that this dependence reveals the presence of the additive and 
multiplicative parts of uncertainties in NO2 columns. The additive error is evidently about 2⋅1014 cm2, while the 
multiplicative error is between 10 and 20 percent. 

4.2 

A posteriori emissions 

Figure 9 presents the ratios of the a posteriori to a priori emissions and also the differences between a posteriori and 
a priori emissions. These correction factors and differences were obtained with optimal estimates of σa, σb and σc 
discussed above. Considering the results shown in Fig. 9, it is evident that the obtained emission corrections are not 
distributed truly randomly in space. On the contrary, the positive and negative changes of the a priori emissions in 
neighbouring grid cells tend to covariate. In particular, in accordance to our results, the a priori emissions are 
probably overestimated for the largest part of Great Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, 
Bulgaria, Greece, and Iraq, but mostly underestimated for Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Czechia, Former Yugoslavia, 

 

10

Turkey, Lebanon and Iran. The emission correction factors are typically inside of the range from 0.5 to 2, but there 
are also exceptions. Regarding the possible origin of these covariances, it is useful to note first that we revealed 
similar covariances (although not exactly for the same regions) when we considered spatial distributions (not shown 
here) of ratios (or differences) of the different emission data used in this study for approximating the dependence of 
emission uncertainties on the magnitude of the emission rate in a given grid cell (see Section 3.3). This observation 
means that the regional covariances in emission uncertainties can actually exist. Most probably, they are a 
consequence of systematic biases in emission factors that were used for estimation of NOx emissions from 
predominant (for a given region or country) types of sources. However, it should be taken into account that the 
model/measurement errors may also spatially covariate due to specific features (meteorology, land use, topography) 
of different regions. And besides, the inverse modelling scheme based on the probabilistic approach (as well as any 
inversion scheme involving regularization) may itself introduce some smoothing to the real distribution of errors in 
emissions. Because of these possibilities, one cannot be sure that the a posteriori emission estimates are actually 
more accurate than a priori emissions for individual pixels. Nonetheless, as it is argued below, on the average, the 
uncertainty in a posteriori emissions is smaller than the uncertainty of the a priori emissions. In general, the emission 
correction factors provided here should be considered in the probabilistic sense together with estimates of their 
uncertainties. 
The estimates of uncertainties in the a priori and a posteriori total emissions and the relative reduction of the 
uncertainties are shown in Fig. 10. This figure provides two levels of information. The first level is the uncertainty 
values depicted in colour, while the second level is the fact that the pixel is not blank. Because the uncertainty in 
anthropogenic emissions is found to be significantly lower than the uncertainty in biogenic emissions (see Table 1), 
the uncertainty in total emissions is typically lower in the regions where the fraction of anthropogenic emissions is 
larger. It is useful to note also that in accordance to the assumption about statistical independence of uncertainties in 
anthropogenic and biogenic emissions, the uncertainty in the total emission rate in a given grid cell may be smaller 
than the uncertainties in either anthropogenic or biogenic emission rates taken separately. In several grid cells, the 
confidence interval for a posteriori estimates turned out to be larger than the confidence interval for a priori 
emissions. This is mainly because of possible uncertainties in the internal parameters of the inverse modelling 
scheme (such as σc and σe), Nonetheless, the results for such grid cells are not necessarily useless, as long as the 
sign of the difference between a posteriori and a priori emissions in a considered grid cell is statistically significant. 
In order to distinguish between these possibilities, the relative reduction of the uncertainty in a priori emissions is 
presented in Fig. 10c only for those grid cells for which it actually takes place (i.e., it is positive), while Figure 10b 
shows additionally results for those grid cells for which the direction of the proposed change in a priori emissions is 
statistically significant (in terms of the 68.3 percentile). The statistical significance of the direction of the a priori 
emission change is also estimated in the Monte Carlo experiment. The averages of a priori and a posteriori 
uncertainties and of the uncertainty reductions for different regions are listed in Table 2. Although the uncertainty 
reduction is, on average, not large, it is significant for many grid cells, especially in Western Europe where the 
reduction exceeds 30 percent almost for each fourth grid cell among those for which the emission uncertainty is 
reduced. The reduction of uncertainties is, on average, smaller outside of Western Europe, but still is considerable 
(more than 20 percent) for most of the major cities (with population of about 1 million or more). We would like to 
remind that the a posteriori uncertainties reported here are likely to be overestimated (see Sec. 3.5). Accordingly, it 
is probable that the uncertainty is actually reduced for a larger number of grid cells than shown in Fig. 10c. Because 
of this possibility, we do not exclude any grid cells from the a posteriori emission dataset when using it for checking 
the agreement of the modelled results with measurements (see section 4.3). Otherwise, it is always possible to 
replace the a posteriori emissions in the grid cells where their uncertainty is expected to be too large with the a priori 
emissions. 

Table  3  lists  the  a  priori  and  a  posteriori  emission  rates  for  54  major  cities  marked  on  our  plots.  Most  of  these 
estimates  are  obtained  using  bilinear  interpolation  between  four  grid cells closest to the city centre. Naturally, such 
estimates  reflect  not  only  emissions  within  the  city  boundaries  but  in  most  cases,  also  emissions from (cid:147) satellite(cid:148) 
cities.  Nevertheless,  we  believe  that  such  data  are  useful,  particularly  because  they  are  rather  easy  to  use  for  inter-
comparison  with  similar  results  of  other  inverse  modelling  studies  and  emission  inventories.  In  accordance to our 
results,  the  a  priori  emissions  are  probably  overestimated  (or  underestimated)  for  half  of  the  cities  (27)  listed  in 
Table  3.  However,  the  differences  between  the  a  priori  and a posteriori emissions exceed the uncertainty range only 
for part of the cities (21), which are marked in bold in Table 3. In particular, a statistically significant overestimation 
of  a  priori  emission  is  found  for  Baghdad  (a  factor of 3.1), Bucharest (1.3), Copenhagen (1.4), Enteb (1.3), London 
(1.2),  Nizhny  Novgorod  (1.3),  S.-  Petersburg  (1.8),  Samara  (1.3),  Stockholm  (1.3)  and Volgograd (1.5), while an 
underestimation  is  probable  for  Amman  (1.5),  Beirut  (3.8),  Bursa  (1.7),  Isfahan  (2.1),  Istanbul  (1.7),  Izmir  (1.7), 
Madrid (1.3), Tabriz (6.3), Tbilisi (3.2), Tehran (3.3) and Yerevan (3.4). 
It is useful to note that the spatial distribution of uncertainties in a priori emissions for Western Europe is, overall, in 
reasonable agreement with the results of our previous study (Konovalov et al., 2006). However, the different spatial 
resolution of the model domains used in these two studies and different years of the analysis prevent us from direct 
comparison of the results.

4.3 

Validation of a posteriori emissions with measurement data 

It seems reasonable to expect that if the a posteriori emissions are really better, they should lead to improvements in 
the agreement between the modelled and measured data. The NO2 columns calculated with the a posteriori 
emissions are compared with the NO2 columns derived from satellite measurements in scatter plots shown in Fig. 
11. Similar scatter plots but obtained with the a priori emissions were discussed above (see Fig. 4). The comparison 
of results presented in Figs. 4 and 11 reveals that the NO2 columns calculated with the a posteriori emissions 
demonstrate much better agreement with the measured NO2 columns. In particular, the coefficient of determination 
(R2) calculated for the NO2 columns from SCIAMACHY and the unbiased NO2 columns from CHIMERE is 
increased from 0.88 to 0.94. This means, that the residual spatial variability, which is not taken into account by the 
model, is reduced by a factor of 2. The agreement still is not perfect, particularly because a considerable part of the 
uncertainties in NO2 columns is not due to uncertainties in emissions (see Fig. 8). Anyway, this result proves that the 
inversion scheme works properly. However, the improvement of the agreement between the measured and modelled 
NO2 columns can only be considered as necessary but still insufficient evidence in favour of our emission estimates. 
Indeed, a very good agreement between measured and modelled NO2 columns could, in principle, be insured by 
assigning unrealistically large values for the uncertainties in a priori emissions and/or too small values for the 
uncertainties in NO2 columns. But in such a case, the differences between the a posteriori and a priori emissions 
would mostly reflect uncertainties in the available data for NO2 columns rather than actual uncertainties in the a 
priori NOx emissions.  
The comparison of the modelled and measured near surface concentrations of ozone provides a more critical test for 
our a posteriori emissions, since these data have not been used directly for fitting NOx emissions, but only for 
optimization of two (cid:147) global(cid:148) parameters (σa and σb) of the inversion scheme. While the results discussed here are 
obtained with optimal values of these parameters, it is important to note that the comparison statistic discussed 
below are not very sensitive to their changes. In fact, we have found that if the use of a posteriori emissions 
improves some ozone statistics, the improvement takes place in a very wide range of values of σa and σb. Moreover, 
values of σa and σb that correspond to the minimum of the cost function G (see Eq. (16)) do not necessarily yield 
optimum values of other possible ozone comparison statistics. 
Figure 12 presents the scatter plots of the seasonally average daily maximums of ozone concentrations at the stations 
in Western and Eastern Europe. While considering these results, it is useful to keep in mind that the spatial 
distribution of NOx emissions is only one of the numerous factors controlling the level of near surface ozone. 
Among other factors, there are, in particular, the deposition, the vertical and horizontal transport, chemical 
transformations of a number of related species, spatial distribution and temporal evolution of emissions rates of the 
spectrum of hydrocarbons. As neither of these processes is simulated perfectly, it is reasonable to expect that even if 
we would be able to correct all errors in the spatial distribution of the seasonally mean NOx emissions used as the a 
priori emissions in our model, this would not result in a strong reduction of uncertainties in the simulated ozone 
concentrations. Moreover, measurement sites may not be entirely representative for a model grid cell. Nevertheless, 
the results presented in Fig. 12 demonstrate the evident improvement of the agreement between ozone simulations 
and measurements. In particular, the coefficient of the determination (square of the correlation coefficient) is 
increased by 21 percent (from 0.37 to 0.45) for Western Europe and 7 (from 0.53 to 0.57) percent for Eastern 
Europe. In order to check that the attained level of the improvement of the agreement between the simulated and 
measured ozone concentrations is not inconsistent with the estimated level of the uncertainty in the a priori 
emissions, we considered a test case for which we used the perturbed a priori emissions with additional uncertainties 
sampled randomly from the lognormal distributions. The level of these additional uncertainties corresponded to our 
estimates of uncertainties in the a priori emissions. Using the perturbed emissions, we found the coefficient of the 
determination to decrease only by 10 percent for Western Europe and 11 percent for Eastern Europe. This decrease 
gives the order of improvement that we can expect when replacing a priori emissions by perfect emissions. Note that 
in our test we disregarded possible spatial covariances of the emission uncertainties; this can explain why the 
decrease in the coefficient of determination for Western Europe in the test case is smaller than its increase with the a 
posteriori emissions.  
It seems reasonable to expect that the sensitivity of ozone to changes of emissions is larger for days on which the 
photochemical ozone production is strong. Such days should correspond to high percentiles of ozone concentrations. 
Figure 13 shows the scatter plots of 90th percentile of observed and modelled daily maximums of ozone 
concentration. Because 90th percentiles are at the edge of statistical distribution, the overall agreement between the 
model and observation is as expected worse here than in the case with the seasonally average ozone concentrations. 
However, the relative improvements due to corrections in NOx emissions are larger. In particular, the coefficient of 
determination is increased from 0.13 to 0.22 (that is, 61 percent) for Western Europe and from 0.44 to 0.54 (22 
percent) for Eastern Europe. 
We also considered the relative differences in the root mean squared errors (RMSE) and the differences in the linear 
correlation coefficient calculated for each station with the a priori and a posteriori emissions. Both statistics were 
calculated for daily maximums of ozone concentrations. It is found that improvements take place for most of the 
stations. Specifically, the root mean squared error is reduced for 74 out of 110 stations and the correlation 
coefficient is increased for 69 stations. A simple statistical test (based on a Monte Carlo experiment) shows that if 
the result of the inversion were equivalent to a random change of the comparison statistics for the considered set of 

 

12

the stations, then the probability of having the correlation coefficient increased at 69 or more stations would be only 
about 1 percent. Considering the ozone statistics separately for three different regions defined above we find that 
both RMSE and the correlation coefficient is improved for 62 stations out of 94 at Western Europe. In Eastern 
Europe, RMSE is improved for 11 stations out of 15, but the correlation coefficient is improved only for 6 stations. 
Both statistics are improved for a single station at the Afro-Asian region. Because the number of stations located 
outside of Western Europe is rather limited, the results obtained for Eastern Europe and the Afro-Asian regions 
alone are not statistically significant. In particular, although the changes of the correlation coefficient for the stations 
at Eastern Europe seem to indicate that the a posteriori emissions are worse than the a priori emissions, the 
probability that the hypothesis about entirely random origin of this result is false is less than 40 percent. Therefore, 
considering all results, we can conclude that the use of the a posteriori emissions in CHIMERE results in statistically 
significant improvements of ozone simulations both for the whole ensemble of EMEP stations and for the stations 
located only in Western Europe. Taking into account that the level of near surface ozone concentrations and 
tropospheric column amounts of nitrogen dioxide are driven by significantly different processes, we consider this 
result as a good argument that the emission estimates elaborated in this study are actually more accurate than the 
emissions used in the standard version of our model. In future, it would be useful also to try to employ the a 
posteriori emissions elaborated in this study with a different model. The respective emission data (in the digital 
form) are available upon request. It should be kept in mind that our results concern emissions averaged over three 
summer months of 2003 rather than annual emissions. Accordingly, the emission uncertainties discussed here may 
not only be due to uncertainties in the corresponding annual data but also due to uncertainties in factors describing 
the temporal evolution of the emission in the model. Nonetheless, as gridded emission datasets are mainly intended 
for the use in the atmospheric models, we believe that the results of the analysis performed in this study may help in 
improving performance of other continental scale models. 
 

5  Conclusions 
We used data of tropospheric NO2 column amounts derived from satellite measurements in combination with 
measurements of near surface ozone concentrations in order to estimate uncertainties in spatially distributed 
emission data used in a continental scale chemistry transport model and to elaborate less uncertain emission 
estimates. We employed an original inverse modeling method, which, in contrast to more common approaches, does 
not require explicit assumptions about the magnitudes of uncertainties in emission inventories and measurement 
data. Specifically, we derive the information on spatial distribution of emissions from satellite data, while the 
uncertainties in the input data are estimated using both ground based ozone observations and satellite data. Our 
inverse modeling scheme also includes a Monte Carlo experiment, which is designed to estimate uncertainties in a 
posteriori emissions. We used the state of-the-art chemistry transport model CHIMERE, in which the anthropogenic 
emissions are prescribed based on EMEP emission inventory for the year 2003 and biogenic NO emissions are 
calculated in the model based on well known methodologies and data. The data for tropospheric NO2 columns were 
derived from SCIAMACHY measurements performed during the summer months of 2003 and the data for near 
surface ozone concentrations were obtained from the EMEP ground based monitoring network that includes more 
than 100 stations. The region considered in this study includes Western and Eastern Europe, a part of Northern 
Africa and Middle East.  

Our  results  suggest  that  both  the  anthropogenic  and  biogenic  emissions  used  in  CHIMERE  are  rather  uncertain. 
Specifically,  the  uncertainties  in the anthropogenic and biogenic emissions are estimated to be about 1.7 and 7.4 (in 
terms  of  the  geometric  standard  deviation).  Such  a  level  of  emission  uncertainties  is  found  to  be  consistent  with 
differences  between  different  emission  inventories.  The  spatial  distribution  of  the  emission  uncertainties  is  neither 
homogeneous  nor fully random. It is found, in particular, that the total anthropogenic and biogenic a priori emission 
estimates  are probably mostly overestimated for Great Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, 
Bulgaria,  Greece,  and  Iraq,  but  mostly  underestimated  for  Spain,  Italy,  Switzerland,  Czechia,  Former Yugoslavia, 
Turkey,  Lebanon  and  Iran.  We  also  have  found  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  a  posteriori  and  a 
priori  emissions  for  several  major  cities  and  their  surroundings.  In  particular,  the  a  priori  emissions  are  probably 
overestimated  for  Baghdad  (a  factor  of  3.1),  Bucharest  (1.3),  Copenhagen  (1.4), Enteb (1.3), London (1.2), Nizhny 
Novgorod (1.3), S.- Petersburg (1.8), Samara (1.3), Stockholm (1.3) and Volgograd (1.5), while the underestimation 
is  probable  for  Amman  (  a  factor  of 1.5), Beirut (3.8), Bursa (1.7), Isfahan (2.1), Istanbul (1.7), Izmir (1.7), Madrid 
(1.3), Tabriz (6.3), Tbilisi (3.2), Tehran (3.3) and Yerevan (3.4). 
It is found that the a posteriori emissions considerably improve the agreement between the simulated and measured 
NO2 columns. Even more importantly, a statistically significant improvement of the model performance is obtained 
with respect to near surface ozone concentrations. It is found that the root mean squared error defined for daily 
maximums of ozone concentrations is decreased for 67 percent of the stations and the correlation coefficient is 
increased for 63 percent of the stations. Although the obtained changes in the ozone statistics are not large, it is 
argued that they are consistent with the sensitivity of ozone to changes in the spatial structure of NOx emissions. 
This sensitivity is not strong because ozone behaviour is controlled by many other factors besides the spatial 
distribution of NOx emissions. Since the ozone measurements (in contrast to the data for NO2 columns) have not 
been directly used for optimisation of the spatial structure of NOx emissions, we consider the improvement of ozone 
simulation as an important argument that the a posteriori emission estimates are really better than the a priori 

 

13

emissions. Moreover, we believe that this result is very important in view of prospects of further applications of 
satellite measurements in regional air pollution studies, as it shows that satellite observations can help in improving 
air quality models. However, this study is only one of the first steps in this promising direction. 
Future work in this direction may include, in particular, studying the long-term temporal evolution of NOx emissions 
by using the available sets of GOME and SCIAMACHY observations since 1996. This would allow validation of 
the emission trends reported in available (cid:147) bottom-up(cid:148) emission inventories. Another promising opportunity is the 
inversion of emissions of hydrocarbons. Although the available observations of hydrocarbons in the lower 
atmosphere are rather limited, we believe that the satellite measurements of several hydrocarbon species such as 
formaldehyde, glyoxal, and methanol (e.g. Palmer et al., 2001; Dufour et al., 2006; Wittrock et al., 2006) can be 
used as indicators of emissions of other hydrocarbons. We believe also that the combination of satellite and ground 
based measurements can be used for obtaining more information on variations of emissions of NOx and VOC on 
scales from days to months.

The reported values represent average total emission rates for three summer months (June to August) 2003 in units 
of molecules*1011/(cm2*s). The estimates are obtained using bi-linear interpolation of the data for 4 model(cid:146)s grid 
cells closest to the city center. The uncertainties (in terms of the geometric standard deviation) are given in the 
brackets. The cities for which differences between the a priori and a posteriori emissions exceed the uncertainty 
range are marked in bold.

AN INTRODUCTION TO NONCOMMUTATIVE GEOMETRY

Departamento de Matem´aticas, Universidad de Costa Rica,

Joseph C. V´arilly

2060 San Jos´e, Costa Rica

Introduction

These are lecture notes for a course given at the Summer School on Noncommuta-
tive Geometry and Applications, sponsored by the European Mathematical Society, at
Monsaraz, Portugal and at Lisboa, from the 1st to the 10th of September, 1997.

Noncommutative geometry, which already occupies an extensive and wide-ranging
area of mathematics, has come under increasing scrutiny from physicists interested in
what it has to say about fundamental problems of Nature. This course sought to address
a mixed audience of students and young researchers, both mathematicians and physicists,
and to provide a gateway to some of its more recent developments.

Many approaches can be taken to introducing noncommutative geometry. I decided
to focus on the geometry of Riemannian spin manifolds and their noncommutative cousins,
which are geometries determined by a suitable generalization of the Dirac operator. These
geometries underlie the NCG approach to phenomenological particle models and recent
attempts to place gravity and matter ﬁelds on the same geometrical footing.

The ﬁrst two lectures are devoted to commutative geometry; we set up the general
framework and then compute a simple example, the two-sphere, in noncommutative terms.
The general deﬁnition of a geometry is then laid out and exempliﬁed with the noncom-
mutative torus. Enough details are given so that one can see clearly that NCG is just
ordinary geometry, extended by discarding the commutativity assumption on the coordi-
nate algebra. Classiﬁcation up to equivalence is dealt with brieﬂy in lecture 7.

Other lectures explore some of the tools of the trade: the noncommutative integral,
the rˆole of quantization, and the spectral action functional. Physical models are not treated
directly, since these were the subject of other lectures at the Summer School, but most of
the mathematical issues needed for their understanding are dealt with here.

I wish to thank several people who contributed in no small way to assembling these
lectures. Jos´e M. Gracia-Bond´ıa gave decisive help at many points; he and Alejandro
Rivero provided constructive criticism throughout. I thank Daniel Kastler, Bruno Iochum,
Thomas Sch¨ucker and Daniel Testard for the opportunity to visit the Centre de Physique
Th´eorique of the CNRS at Marseille, and the pleasure of learning and practising noncom-
mutative geometry at the source.
I am grateful for enlightening discussions with Alain
Connes, Robert Coquereaux, Ricardo Estrada, H´ector Figueroa, Thomas Krajewski, Gio-
vanni Landi, Fedele Lizzi, Carmelo Mart´ın, William Ugalde and Mark Villarino. Thanks
also to Jes´us Clemente, Stephan de Bi`evre and Markus Walze who provided indispens-
able references. Several improvements to the original draft notes were suggested by Eli
Hawkins, Thomas Sch¨ucker and Georges Skandalis. Last but by no means least, I want to
discharge a particular debt of gratitude to Paulo Almeida for his energy and foresight in
organizing this Summer School in the right place at the right time.

1. Commutative Geometry from the Noncommutative Point of View

The traditional arena of geometry and topology is a set of points with some particular
structure that, for want of a better name, we call a space. Thus, for instance, one studies
curves and surfaces as subsets of an ambient Euclidean space.
It was recognized early
on, however, that even such a fundamental geometrical object as an elliptic curve is best
studied not as a set of points (a torus) but rather by examining functions on this set,
speciﬁcally the doubly periodic meromorphic functions. Weierstrass opened up a new
approach to geometry by studying directly the collection of complex functions that satisfy
an algebraic addition theorem, and derived the point set as a consequence. In probability
theory, the set of outcomes of an experiment forms a measure space, and one may regard
events as subsets of outcomes; but most of the information is obtained from “random
variables”, i.e., measurable functions on the space of outcomes.

In noncommutative geometry, under the inﬂuence of quantum physics, this general
idea of replacing sets of points by classes of functions is taken further. In many cases the
set is completely determined by an algebra of functions, so one forgets about the set and
obtains all information from the functions alone. Also, in many geometrical situations the
associated set is very pathological, and a direct examination yields no useful information.
The set of orbits of a group action, such as the rotation of a circle by multiples of an
irrational angle, is of this type.
In such cases, when we examine the matter from the
algebraic point of view, we often obtain a perfectly good operator algebra that holds the
information we need; however, this algebra is generally not commutative. Thus, we proceed
by ﬁrst discovering how function algebras determine the structure of point sets, and then
learning which relevant properties of function algebras do not depend on commutativity.
In a famous paper [52] that has become a cornerstone of noncommutative geometry,
Gelfand and Na˘ımark in 1943 characterized the involutive algebras of operators by just
dropping commutativity from the most natural axiomatization for the algebra of continuous
functions on a locally compact Hausdorﬀ space. The starting point for noncommutative
geometry that we shall adopt here is to study ordinary “commutative” spaces via their
algebras of functions, omitting wherever possible any reference to the commutativity of
these algebras.

The Gelfand–Na˘ımark cofunctors

The Gelfand–Na˘ımark theorem can be thought of as the construction of two con-
travariant functors (cofunctors for short) from the category of locally compact Hausdorﬀ
spaces to the category of C∗-algebras.

The ﬁrst cofunctor C takes a compact space X to the C∗-algebra C(X) of continuous
Y to its transpose
complex-valued functions on X, and takes a continuous map f : X
Cf : h
C(X). If X is only a locally compact space, the corresponding
C∗-algebra is C0(X) whose elements are continuous functions vanishing at inﬁnity, and we
require that the continuous maps f : X
Y be proper (the preimage of a compact set is
compact) in order that h

f take C0(Y ) into C0(X).

The C∗-algebra viewpoint also allows one to study the topology of non-Hausdorﬀ
spaces, such as arise in probing a continuum where points are unresolved: see the book by
Landi on noncommutative spaces [79].

A commutative C∗-algebra has an abundant supply of characters, one for each point
of the associated space. Looking ahead to noncommutative algebras, we can anticipate
that characters will be fairly scarce, and we need not bother to search for points. There
is, however, one rˆole for points that survives in the noncommutative case: that of zero-
dimensional elements of a homological skeleton or cell decomposition of a topological space.
For that purpose, characters are not needed; we shall require functionals that are only traces
on the algebra, but are not necessarily multiplicative.

The Γ functor

Continuous functions determine a space’s topology, but to do geometry we need at
least a diﬀerentiable structure. Thus we shall assume from now on that our “commutative
space” is in fact a diﬀerential manifold M , of dimension n. For convenience, we shall
usually assume that M is compact, even though this leaves aside important examples such
as Minkowski space. (It turns out that noncommutative geometry has been developed so far
almost entirely in the Euclidean signature, where compactness can be seen as a simplifying
technical assumption. How to adapt the theory to deal with spaces with indeﬁnite metric
is very much an open problem at this stage.)

A

The C∗-algebra A = C(M ) of continuous functions must then be replaced by the
= C∞(M ) of smooth functions on the manifold M . This is not, of course, a C∗-
algebra

use the theory of locally convex algebras: our tactic is to work with the dense subalgebra

elements of A.

Hermitian metrics and spinc structures

Any complex vector bundle can be endowed (in many ways) with a Hermitian metric.
The conventional practice is to deﬁne a positive deﬁnite sesquilinear form (

ﬁbre Ex of the bundle, which must “vary smoothly with x”. The noncommutative point
of view is to eliminate x, whereupon what remains is a pairing

In the category of C∗-algebras, one replaces ﬁnite projective modules by arbitrary

that δ(Cℓ(M )) = W3(T M ), the integral class that is the obstruction to the existence of
a spinc structure in the conventional sense of a lifting of the structure group of T M from
SO(n) to Spinc(n): see [83, Appendix D] for more information on W3(T M ).

Thus M admits spinc structures if and only if δ(Cℓ(M )) = 0. But in the Dixmier–
Douady theory, δ(Cℓ(M )) is the obstruction to constructing (within the C∗-category) a
B-A-bimodule
that implements a Morita equivalence between A = C0(M ) and B =
C0(M, Cℓ(M )). Let us paraphrase Plymen’s redeﬁnition of a spinc structure, in the spirit
of noncommutative geometry:

S

S

Deﬁnition. Let M be a Riemannian manifold, A = C0(M ) and B = C0(M, Cℓ(M )). We
say that the tangent bundle T M admits a spinc structure if and only if it is orientable
and δ(Cℓ(M )) = 0. In that case, a spinc structure on T M is a pair (ǫ,
) where ǫ is an
orientation on T M and

is a B-A-equivalence bimodule.

S

Following an earlier terminology introduced by Atiyah, Bott and Shapiro [2] in their

Notice that K-orientability demands more than mere orientability in the cohomological
sense.

S

? By the Serre–Swan theorem, it is of the form
What is this equivalence bimodule
Γ(S) for some complex vector bundle S
M that also carries an irreducible left action of
the Cliﬀord algebra bundle Cℓ(M ). This is the spinor bundle whose existence displays the
spinc structure in the conventional picture. We call Γ(S) = C∞(M, S) the spinor module;
it is an irreducible Cliﬀord module in the terminology of [2], and has rank 2m over C∞(M )
if n = 2m or 2m + 1.

S
→

Another matter is how to ﬁt into this picture spin structures on M (liftings of the
structure group of T M from SO(n) to Spin(n) rather than Spinc(n)). These are distin-
guished by the availability of a conjugation operator J on the spinors (which is antilinear);
we shall take up this matter later.

To summarize: the language of bimodules and Morita equivalence gives us direct
access to noncommutative (or commutative) vector bundles without ever invoking the
concept of a “principal bundle”. Although several proposals for deﬁning a noncommutative
principal bundle are available —see, for instance, [62]— for now we must pass them by.

The Dirac operator and the distance formula

As soon as a spinor module makes its appearance, one can introduce the Dirac
operator. This is a selfadjoint ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operator D/ deﬁned on the space
:= L2(M, S) of square-integrable spinors, whose domain includes the smooth spinors

(1.6)

and one discovers that the metric on the space of characters M (

) is entirely determined

This is, of course, just a tautology in commutative geometry; but it opens the way
forward, since it shows that what one must carry over to the noncommutative case is
precisely this operator, or a suitable analogue. One still must deal with the fact that for
noncommutative algebras the characters will be scarce. The lesson that (1.6) teaches [24]
is that the length element ds is in some sense inversely proportional to D/ ; we shall return
to this matter later.

For a general overview of the many ways in which the noncommutative point of view
enriches our insight at all levels: measurable, topological, diﬀerential and metric, consult
the recent review [67].

The ingredients for a reformulation of commutative geometry in algebraic terms are
; a
almost in place. We list them brieﬂy: an algebra
; a conjugation operator J, still to be discussed; and, in even-
selfadjoint operator D/ on
dimensional cases, a Z2-grading operator χ on
. This package of four or ﬁve terms is
called a real spectral triple or a real K-cycle or, more simply, a geometry. Our task will
be to study, to exemplify, and if possible, to parametrize these geometries.

Nevertheless, the associated spectral triples are not completely transparent, and their con-

Deﬁnition. We call the data set (C∞(S2), L2(S2, S), D/ , γ3, J) the fundamental spec-
tral triple, or fundamental K-cycle, for the commutative spin manifold S2.

The Lichnerowicz formula. This formula [7] relates the square of the Dirac operator on
the spinor module to the spinor Laplacian; the diﬀerence between the two is one quarter
of the scalar curvature K of the underlying spin manifold: D/ 2 = ∆S + 1
4 K. For the
sphere S2 with the metric already chosen, the scalar curvature (or Gaussian curvature) is
K = gijRk

ikj = 2, so that the Lichnerowicz formula in this case is just

D/ 2 = ∆S + 1

Spinor harmonics and the spectrum of D/

The eigenspinors of D/ can now be found by turning up appropriate matrix elements
of well-known representations of SU (2); but a more pedestrian approach is quicker. These
eigenspinors appear already in Newman and Penrose [92] under the name spinor harmon-
ics, and were further studied by Goldberg et al [55].

Their construction is based on two simple observations. The ﬁrst is an elementary

calculation with the ð operator:

One sees at once that suitable combinations of the functions q−lzr(

The other matter is that compatibility with gauge transformations of spinors (2.2)

We now show, in the context of our example

K-cycles by twisting the fundamental one. However, these K-cycles will not always respect
the “real structure” J, as we shall see.
We examine ﬁrst the case where

E(m) is a module of sections of a complex line
bundle of ﬁrst Chern class m. Then the twisted spinor module is also Z2-graded; in fact,

general fact [25] that commutation (or anticommutation) of D/ with J picks out a spin

3. Real Spectral Triples: the Axiomatic Foundation

Having exempliﬁed how diﬀerential geometry may be made algebraic in the commu-
tative case of Riemannian spin manifolds, we now extract the essential features of this
formulation, with a view to relaxing the constraint of commutativity on the underlying
algebra. We shall follow quite closely the treatment of Connes in [25, 26], wherein an
axiomatic scheme for noncommutative geometries is set forth. Indeed, one could say that
these lectures are essentially an extended meditation on those axioms.

block for a K-homology theory) or a spectral triple. This consists of three pieces of data
(

conditions which we formulate as axioms. If Γ is present, we say that the K-cycle is even,
otherwise it is odd .
If J is present, we say the K-cycle is real; if not, we can call it
“complex”. We shall, however, concentrate on the real case.

In particular, D has a discrete
spectrum of eigenvalues of ﬁnite multiplicity. This generalizes the case of a Dirac operator

the length element ds :=

D

By “inﬁnitesimal” we mean simply a compact operator on

. Since the days of Leibniz,
an inﬁnitesimal is conceptually a nonzero quantity smaller than any positive ǫ. Since we
work on the arena of an inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space, we may forgive the violation of
the requirement T < ǫ over a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace (that may depend on ǫ). T must
then be an operator with discrete spectrum, with any nonzero λ in sp(T ) having ﬁnite
multiplicity; in other words, the operator T must be compact.

H

The singular values of T , i.e., the eigenvalues of the positive compact operator

:=

Notice that inﬁnitesimals of ﬁrst order have singular values that form a logarithmically
divergent series:

µk(T ) = O(log N ).

The dimension axiom can then be reformulated as: “there is an integer n for which the
singular values of D−n form a logarithmically divergent series”.
The coeﬃcient of logarithmic divergence will be denote by

−n, where

the noncommutative integral; we shall have more to say about it later.
Example. Let us compute the dimension of the sphere S2 from its fundamental K-cycle.

[[D, a], Jb∗J †] = 0.

−

A

This could be rewritten as [[D, a], b0] = 0 or, more precisely, [[D, π(a)], π0(b)] = 0.
Using (3.2) and the Jacobi identity, we see that this condition is symmetric in the repre-
sentation π and π0, since

[a, [D, b0]] = [[a, D], b0] + [D, [a, b0]] =

[[D, a], b0] = 0.

In the commutative case, the condition (3.4) expresses the fact that the Dirac operator is
a ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operator:

[[D/ , a], Jb∗J †] = [[D/ , a], b] = [γ(da), b] = 0.

(Contrast this with a second-order operator like a Laplacian, that satisﬁes [[∆, a], b] =

2g−1(da, db), generally nonzero [7].)

AN INTRODUCTION TO NONCOMMUTATIVE GEOMETRY

Poincar´e duality and K-theory

Axiom 6 (Poincar´e duality). The Fredholm index of the operator D yields a nonde-

On a compact oriented n-dimensional manifold M , Poincar´e duality is usually formu-
lated [36] as an isomorphism of cohomology (in degree k) with homology (in degree n
k),
or equivalently as a nondegenerate bilinear pairing on the cohomology ring H •(M ). (For
noncompact manifolds, the pairing is between the ordinary and the compactly supported

In view of the existence of isomorphisms between K •(M )

Z Q and H •(M ; Q) given
by the Chern character, one could hope to reformulate this as a canonical pairing on the
K-theory ring. This can be done if M is a spinc manifold; the rˆole of the orientation
[Ω] in cohomology is replaced by the K-orientation, so that the corresponding pairing of
K-rings is mediated by the Dirac operator: see [22, IV.1.γ] or [19] for a discussion of how
this pairing arises. We leave aside the translation from K-theory to cohomology (by no
means a short story) and explain brieﬂy how the intersection form may be computed in
the K-context.

Poincar´e duality is the assertion that this pairing on K•(

) is nondegenerate. For
M3(C) that acts on the space of
the case of the ﬁnite-dimensional algebra
fermions of the Standard Model [106], the intersection form has been computed in [24]
6.2]). For more general ﬁnite-dimensional algebras, see [77, 93]. In that
(see also [86,
§
context, Poincar´e duality is a very eﬃcient discriminator that rules out several plausible
alternatives to the Standard Model.

These tables, with their periodicity in steps of 8, arise from the structure of real Clif-

dation of this real Bott periodicity. We claim that, in the commutative case of Riemannian
spin manifolds, one can ﬁnd conjugation operators J on spinors that satisfy the foregoing
sign rules. Thus, for instance, J 2 =
1 for Dirac spinors over 4-dimensional spaces with
Euclidean signature. (We make no attempt to extend the theory to Minkowskian spaces
at this stage.) Notice also that the signs for dimension two are those we have used in the
example of the Riemann sphere.

Riemannian spin manifolds provide the commutative examples.

It is not hard to
manufacture noncommutative examples with ﬁnite-dimensional matrix algebras [77, 93];
these are zero-dimensional geometries in the sense of Axiom 1. In the next chapter we
study a more elaborate noncommutative example which, like the Riemann sphere, has
dimension two.

4. Geometries on the Noncommutative Torus

We turn now to an algebra that is not commutative, in order to see how the algebraic
formulation of geometries, as laid out in the previous chapter, allows us to go beyond
Riemannian spin manifolds. Of course, the mere act of moving from commutative to non-
commutative algebras is a very familiar one: it is the mathematical point of departure for
quantum mechanics. As was already made clear by von Neumann in his 1931 study of
the canonical commutation relations [91], the Schr¨odinger representation arises by replac-
ing convolution of functions of two real variables by a noncommutative variant nowadays
called “twisted convolution” [72]. This was reinterpreted by Moyal [90] as a variant of the
ordinary product of functions on a two-dimensional phase space, related to Weyl’s method
of quantization.

We begin, then, with Weyl quantization. We wish to quantize a compact phase space,
since our formalism so far relies heavily on compactness, e.g., by demanding that the length
element ds = D−1 be a compact operator. The Riemann sphere would seem to be a good
candidate, since several studies exist of its quantization both in the Moyal framework [116]
and from the noncommutative geometry point of view [60, 85]. However, all of these
involve an approximating sequence of algebras rather a single algebra and so do not deﬁne
a solitary K-cycle.

We turn instead to the torus T2 (with the ﬂat metric). Via the Gelfand cofunctor, this
is determined by an algebra of doubly periodic functions on R2 (or on C). If ω1, ω2 are the
τ > 0, one identiﬁes T2
periods, with ratio τ := ω2/ω1 in the upper half plane C+, so that
with the quotient space C/(Zω1 + Zω2). These “complex tori” are homeomorphic but are
not all equivalent as complex manifolds. In fact, if one chooses to study these tori through
the algebras of meromorphic functions with the required double periodicity, the resulting
elliptic curves Eτ are classiﬁed by the orbit of τ under the action τ
(aτ + b)/(cτ + d)
of the modular group P SL(2, Z) on C+.

Algebras of Weyl operators

Our starting point is the canonical commutation relations of quantum mechanics on
a one-dimensional conﬁguration space R. In Weyl form [34, 42], these are represented by
a family of unitary operators on L2(R):

The GNS Hilbert space associated to this trace is what we need. Before constructing it,
Nθ is a factor with a ﬁnite normal trace; and it will soon

The Weyl operators Uθ, Vθ are unitary and obey (4.3); thus they generate a faithful
concrete representation of this pre-C∗-algebra. On the other hand, the relation (4.3) alone
generates the algebra Cλ[u, v] known to quantum-group theorists as the Manin q-plane [71]
for q = λ
Aθ is (a completion
of) a quotient algebra of this q-plane.
The irrational rotation algebra gets its name from another representation on L2(T):
the multiplication operator U and the rotation operator V given by (U ψ)(z) := zψ(z) and
(V ψ)(z) := ψ(λz) satisfy (4.3). In the C∗-algebraic framework, U generates the C∗-algebra
C(T) and conjugation by V gives an automorphism α of C(T). Under such circumstances,
the C∗-algebra generated by C(T) and the unitary operator V is called the crossed product
of C(T) by α (more pedantically, by the automorphism group
). In symbols,

It remains to introduce the operator D. Before doing so, we make a brief excursion into
two-dimensional topology.

The skeleton of the noncommutative torus

An ordinary 2-torus may be built up from the following ingredients: (i) a single point;
(ii) two lines, adjoined at their ends to the point to form a pair of circles; and (iii) a plane
sheet, attached along its borders to the two circles. If we take the torus apart again, we
get its “cell decomposition” into a 0-cell, two 1-cells and a 2-cell.

In more technical language, these cells form the skeleton of the torus, and are repre-
sented by independent homology classes: one in H0(T2), two in H1(T2) and one in H2(T2).
The Euler characteristic of the torus is then computed as 1

2 + 1 = 0.

Guided by the Gelfand cofunctor, homology of spaces is replaced by cohomology of
algebras; thus the skeleton of the noncommutative torus will consist of a 0-cocycle, two

1-cocycles and a 2-cocycle on the algebra

τ0(ba) = 0.

The two basic derivations. The partial derivatives ∂/∂φ1, ∂/∂φ2 on the algebra of
Fourier series

A0 = C∞(T2) can be rewritten as

δ1(ars urvs) := 2πir ars urvs,
δ2(ars urvs) := 2πis ars urvs.

(4.7)

These formulae also make sense on

Aθ, and deﬁne derivations δ1, δ2, i.e.,

δj(ab) = (δja) b + a (δjb),

j = 1, 2.

They are symmetric, i.e., (δja)∗ = δj(a∗). Each δj extends to an unbounded operator
on Aθ whose smooth domain is exactly

Aθ. Notice that τ (δ1a) = τ (δ2a) = 0 for all a.

The two cyclic 1-cocycles we need are then given by:

ψ1(a, b) := τ0(a δ1b),

ψ2(a, b) := τ0(a δ2b).

These are cocycles because δ1, δ2 are derivations:

It turns out [19] that HC1(

bψj(a, b, c) = τ0(ab δjc

C[ψ2].

a δj(bc) + a (δjb)c) = 0.

Next, there is a 2-cocycle obtained by promoting the trace τ0 to a cyclic trilinear form:

Sτ0(a, b, c) := τ0(abc).

In fact, one can always promote a cyclic m-cocycle on an algebra to a cyclic (m+2)-cocycle
by the periodicity operator S of Connes [22, III,1.β]. For instance, for m = 1 we get

However, there is another cyclic 2-cocycle that is not in the range of S:

Sψj(a, b, c, d) := ψj(abc, d)

ψj(ab, cd) + ψj(a, bcd).

5. The Noncommutative Integral

One of the striking features of noncommutative geometry is how it ties together many
mathematical and physical approaches in a single unifying theme. So far, our discussion
of the mathematical underpinnings of the geometry has been quite “soft”, emphasizing
the algebraic character of the overall picture. However, when we examine more closely
the interpretation of diﬀerential and integral calculus, we see that the theory requires a
considerable amount of analysis, of a fairly delicate nature. In this chapter we take up the
matter of how to best deﬁne the noncommutative integral and relate it to conventional
integration on manifolds.

In the course of the initial development of noncommutative geometry, integration
came ﬁrst, beginning with Segal’s early work with traces on operator algebras [109] and
continuing with Connes’ work on foliations [18]. The introduction of universal graded
diﬀerential algebras [19] shifted the emphasis to diﬀerential calculus based on derivations,
which formed the backdrop for the ﬁrst applications to particle physics [28, 39]. The
pendulum has recently swung back to integral methods, due to the realization [14, 25, 65]
that the Yang–Mills functionals could be obtained in this way. The primary tool for that
is the noncommutative integral.

The Dixmier trace on inﬁnitesimals

Early attempts at noncommutative integration [109] used the ordinary trace Tr of
operators on a Hilbert space as an ersatz integral, where the traceclass operators play the
rˆole of integrable functions. For example, in Moyal quantization one computes expectation
WA WB dµ, where WA, WB are Wigner functions of operators
values by Tr(AB) =
A, B and µ is the normalized Liouville measure on phase space [12]. However, on the
representation space of a noncommutative geometry one needs an integral that suppresses
inﬁnitesimals of order higher than 1, so Tr will not do; moreover, Tr diverges for positive
ﬁrst-order inﬁnitesimals, since

Dixmier [37] found other (non-normal) tracial functionals on compact operators that are
more suitable for our purposes: they are ﬁnite on ﬁrst order inﬁnitesimals and vanish on
those of higher order. To ﬁnd them, we must look more closely at the ﬁne structure of
inﬁnitesimal operators; our treatment follows [29, Appendix A].

Pseudodiﬀerential operators

In all cases considered up to now, the computation of

T has required a complete
determination of the spectrum of T . This is usually a fairly onerous task and is most
suited to fairly simple examples. An alternative approach is needed, which may allow us
to calculate

T by a general procedure.

R

R

For the commutative case, such a procedure is available: it is the pseudodiﬀerential
operator calculus. The extension of this calculus to the noncommutative case has already
begun and is undergoing rapid development [23, 26, 29], but we cannot report on it here.
We shall conﬁne our attention to a fairly familiar case: elliptic classical pseudodiﬀerential
operators (ΨDOs) on compact Riemannian manifolds.

Deﬁnition. A pseudodiﬀerential operator A of order d on a manifold M is an operator
between two Hilbert spaces of sections of Hermitian vector bundles over M , that can be
written in local coordinates as

Au(x) = (2π)−n

ei(x−y)·ξa(x, ξ)u(y) dny dnξ,

Z Z

where the symbol a(x, ξ) is a matrix of smooth functions whose derivatives satisfy the
)d−|β|. We simplify a little by assuming
growth conditions
that a is scalar-valued, i.e., that the bundles are line bundles. We then say that A is a
Ψd(M ), if its symbol has an asymptotic expansion of the form

We refer to [83, 113] for the full story of these operators. Although the terms of the
expansion (5.7) are generally coordinate-dependent, the principal symbol ad(x, ξ) is globally
deﬁned as a function on the cotangent bundle T ∗M , except possibly on the zero section M .
We call the operator A elliptic if ad(x, ξ) is invertible for ξ

coeﬃcients are endomorphisms of a given vector bundle over M .

The trace theorem

This uniqueness of the trace was exploited by Connes [20], who saw how the Dixmier
traces ﬁt into this picture. The point is that pseudodiﬀerential operators of low enough
order over a compact manifold are already compact operators [113], so that any Dixmier
trace Trω deﬁnes a trace on Ψ−n(M ); and they all deﬁne the same trace, since they co-

incide on measurable operators. Thus all ΨDOs of order (
noncommutative integral is a multiple of Wres. It remains only to compute the propor-
tionality constant. Moreover, since we can reduce to local calculations by patching with
partitions of unity, this constant must be the same for all manifolds of a given dimension.
To ﬁnd it, we can use the power ∆−n/2 of the Laplacian on the torus Tn, whose
noncommutative integral we already know (5.6). Now ∆ is a diﬀerential operator (5.5),

Integrals and zeta residues

We have not explained why the Wodzicki functional is called a residue. It was orig-
inally discovered as the Cauchy residue of a zeta function: see Wodzicki’s introductory
remarks in [122]. Indeed, the following formula can be established [117] with the help of
Seeley’s symbol calculus for complex powers of an elliptic ΨDO [108]:

Ress=1 ζA(s) =

6. Quantization and the Tangent Groupoid

Before embarking on the classiﬁcation of geometries, let us ﬁrst explore an issue of
a more topological nature, namely, the extent to which noncommutative methods allow
us to achieve contact with the quantum world. To begin with, the facile but oft-repeated
phrase, “noncommutative = quantum”, must be disregarded. As the story of the Connes–
Lott model shows, a perfectly noncommutative geometry may be employed to produce
Lagrangians for physical models at the classical level only [22, VI.5]; quantization must
then proceed from this starting point. Nevertheless, the foundations of quantum mechan-
ics do throw up noncommutative geometries, as we have seen with the torus. Also, the
integrality features of the pairing of cyclic cohomology with K-theory give genuine exam-
ples of quantizing. So, it is worthwhile to ask: what is the relation of known quantization
procedures with noncommutative geometry?

The ﬁrst step in the quantization of a system with ﬁnitely many degrees of freedom
is to place the classical and quantum descriptions of the system on the same footing;
the second step is to draw an unbroken line between these descriptions. In conventional
quantum mechanics, the simplest such method is the Wigner–Weyl or Moyal quantization,
which consists in “deforming” an algebra of functions on phase space to an algebra of
operator kernels. In noncommutative geometry, there is a device that accomplishes this in
a most economical manner, namely the tangent groupoid of a conﬁguration space.

Moyal quantizers and the Heisenberg deformation

Since [4] and [6] at least, deformations of algebras have been related to the physics
of quantization. We ﬁrst sketch the general scheme [56], and then illustrate it with the
simplest possible example, namely, the Moyal quantization in terms of the Schr¨odinger
representation of ordinary quantum mechanics for spinless, nonrelativistic particles.

Let X be a smooth symplectic manifold, µ (an appropriate multiple of) the associated
) is

a Hilbert space. A Moyal quantizer for the triple (X, µ,

Liouville measure, and
a map ∆ of the phase space X into the space of selfadjoint operators on

(distributional) reproducing kernel for the measure µ. An essentially equivalent deﬁnition,
in the equivariant context, was introduced ﬁrst in [116]. For the proud owner of a Moyal
quantizer, all quantization problems are solved in principle. Quantization of any function
a on X is eﬀected by

Moyal quantizers are essentially unique and understandably diﬃcult to come by [56].
The standard example is given by the phase space T ∗(Rn) with the canonical symplectic
structure. With Planck constant ¯h > 0 and coordinates u = (q, ξ), we take dµ(q, ξ) :=
= L2(Rn). Then the Moyal quantizer on T ∗(Rn) is given
(2π¯h)−n dnq dnξ. We also take
by a family of symmetries ∆¯h(q, ξ); explicitly, in the Schr¨odinger representation:

One can add more structure, if desired. For example, there are symplectic groupoids,

quantization [58, 121].

Moyal quantization as a continuity condition

Let us now bring into play the Gelfand–Na˘ımark cofunctor C on tangent groupoids.
A function on GM is ﬁrst of all a pair of functions on G′ and G′′ respectively. The ﬁrst
one is essentially a kernel, the second is the (inverse) Fourier transform of a function on
the cotangent bundle T ∗M . The condition that both match to give a continuous function
on GM can be seen precisely as the quantization rule. For clarity, we consider ﬁrst the
case M = Rn. Let a(x, ξ) be a function on T ∗Rn. Its inverse Fourier transform gives us a
function on T Rn:

Remarks on quantization and the index theorem

From the point of view of quantization theory, this is not the whole story. Certainly,
in the previous argument, we could have substituted any interval [0, ¯h0] for [0, 1]. But for
a given value of ¯h0, not every reasonable function on T ∗M can be successfully quantized.
For exponential manifolds, like ﬂat phase space or the Poincar´e disk, everything should
work ﬁne. However, when one tries to apply a similar procedure in compact symplectic
manifolds, one typically ﬁnds cohomological obstructions. This is dealt with in [46], leading
back to the standard results in geometric quantization `a la Kostant–Kirillov–Souriau.

60

AN INTRODUCTION TO NONCOMMUTATIVE GEOMETRY

We are left with the impression that the rˆole of the apparatus of Moyal quantization

in the foundations of noncommutative (topology and) geometry cannot be fortuitous.

Conversely, one can ask what noncommutative geometry can do for quantization the-
ory. Of course, one has to agree ﬁrst on the meaning (at least, on the mathematical side)
of the word “quantization”. The nearly perfect match aﬀorded by the Moyal machinery in
its particular realm is not to be expected in general. For any symplectic manifold, some
kind of “quantum” deformation or star-product can always be found. However, that is
mostly formal and of little use; in general a Moyal quantizer is missing.

The modern temperament (see for instance [50]), that we readily adopt, is to consider
that quantization is embodied in the index theorem. This dictum goes well with the original
meaning of the word “quantization” in Bohr’s old quantum theory. In the rare instances
where it works well, though, it appears to give much more information than just a few
integers (the indices of a certain Fredholm operator). The two more successful examples
of quantization are Moyal quantization of ﬁnite-dimensional symplectic vector spaces and
Kirillov–Kostant–Souriau geometric quantization of ﬂag manifolds. With respect to the
latter, Vergne [118] (see also [8]) has suggested to replace the concept of polarization,
central to Kostant’s work, by the use of Dirac-type operators —which of course takes us
back to the spectral triples of noncommutative geometry.

The new scheme for quantization runs more or less as follows. Let M be a smooth
manifold endowed with a spinc structure (starting from a symplectic manifold, one can
introduce a compatible almost complex structure in order to produce the spinc structure;
the results only depend weakly of the choice made, as the set of almost complex structures
is contractible). Construct prequantum line bundles L over M according to the KKS
recipe, or some improved version like that of [103]. Let DL be a twisted Dirac operator
for L. A quantization of M is the (virtual) Hilbert space

HD,L := ker D+

L −

ker D−
L .

The index theorem gives precisely the dimension of such a space. Under favourable cir-
cumstances, we can do better. In the case of ﬂag manifolds, one quantizes G-bundles and
obtains G-Hilbert spaces. Then the G-index theorem gives us the character of the Kirillov
representation associated to L [7], which contains all the quantum information we seek.

Moyal quantization, on the other hand, is a tool of choice for the proof of the index
theorem, as indicated here. The “logical” (though not the historical) way to go about the
Index Theorem would be to prove the theorem in the ﬂat case ﬁrst using Moyal quantum
mechanics —see [41] or [46]— and then go to analytically simpler but geometrically more
involved cases. Conversely, one is left with the problem of how to recover the whole of
Moyal theory from the index theorem.

7. Equivalence of Geometries

We wish to classify geometries and to form some idea of how many geometries of a
given type are available to us. When modelling physical systems that have an underlying
geometry, we naturally wish to select the most suitable geometry from several plausible
candidates. The ﬁrst question to ask, then, is: when are two geometries the same?

Morita equivalence and Hermitian connections

The unitary equivalence of geometries helps to eliminate obvious redundancies, but it
is not by any means the only way to compare geometries. For one thing, the metric (1.6)
is unchanged —if we think of the right hand side of (1.6) as deﬁning the distance between
pure states ˆp, ˆq of the algebra

.

We need a looser notion of equivalence between geometries that allows to vary not just
the operator data but also the algebra and the Hilbert space. Here the Morita equivalence
to a Morita-
of algebras gives us a clue as to how to proceed. We can change the algebra
equivalent algebra

to well-deﬁned rules. How should we then adapt the remaining data Γ, J and most
importantly D, in order to obtain a Morita equivalence of geometries?

In summary, we have shown how the classiﬁcation of geometries up to Morita equi-
valence allows a ﬁrst-order diﬀerential calculus to enter the picture, via the Hermitian
connections. In the next section, we shall explore the various geometries on a noncommu-
tative manifold from a variational point of view.

8. Action Functionals

On a diﬀerential manifold, one may use many Riemannian metrics; on a spin manifold
with a given Riemannian metric, there may be many distinct (i.e., unitarily inequivalent)
geometries. An important task, already in the commutative case, is to select, if possible,
a particular geometry by some general criterion, such as minimization of an action func-
tional, a time-honoured tradition in physics. In the noncommutative case, the minimizing
geometries are often not unique, leading to the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry
breaking, an important motivation for physical applications [39].

Automorphisms of the algebra

In order to classify geometries, we ﬁx the data (

, Γ, J) and consider how the
inverse distance operator D may be modiﬁed under the actions of automorphisms of the
algebra

The point at issue here is that the automorphism group of the algebra is just the
noncommutative version of the group of diﬀeomorphisms of a commutative manifold. For
instance, if

is the image under α of a unique character ˆy (that is, α−1(ˆx) is also a character,
ˆx of
so it equals ˆy for some y
M ). Write φ(x) := y; then φ is a continuous bijection on M
satisfying α(f )(x) = f (φ−1(x)), and the chain rule for derivatives shows that φ is itself
φ is a group isomorphism from

Already in the commutative case, diﬀeomorphisms change the metric on a manifold.

form IYM ∝

AN INTRODUCTION TO NONCOMMUTATIVE GEOMETRY

A remark on curvature. In Yang–Mills models, the fermionic action is supplemented by
a bosonic action that is a quadratic functional of the gauge ﬁelds or curvatures associated
to the gauge potential A. One may formulate the curvature of a connection in noncom-
mutative geometry and obtain a Yang–Mills action; indeed, this is the main component of
the Connes–Lott models [28]. One can formally introduce the curvature as F := dA + A2,
where the notation means

dA :=

j[D, aj] [D, bj]

whenever A =

j aj[D, bj].

(8.2)

Regrettably, this deﬁnition is ﬂawed, since the ﬁrst sum may be nonzero in cases where
the second sum vanishes [22, VI.1]. For instance, in the commutative case, one may have

The spectral action principle

This Yang–Mills action, evaluated on a suitable geometry, achieves the remarkable
feat of reproducing the classical Lagrangian of the Standard Model. This is discussed at
length in [22, VI] and in several other places [10, 13, 66, 76, 86]. However, its computation
leads to fearsome algebraic manipulations and very delicate handling of the junk terms,
leading one to question whether this action is really fundamental.

correct bosonic action functional should not merely be diﬀeomorphism invariant (where

“The physical action only depends upon sp(D).”

The fruitfulness of this viewpoint has been exempliﬁed by Landi and Rovelli [80, 81], who
consider the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator as dynamical variables for general relativity.
Since quantum corrections must still be provided for [1], the particular action cho-
sen should incorporate a cutoﬀ scale Λ (roughly comparable to inverse Planck length, or
Planck mass, where the commutative spacetime geometry must surely break down), and
some suitable cutoﬀ function: φ(t)

Chamseddine and Connes propose a bosonic action of the form

Bφ(D) = Tr φ(D2/Λ2).

(8.3)

This spectral action turns out to include not only the Standard Model bosonic action but
also the Einstein–Hilbert action for gravity, plus some higher-order gravitational terms,
thereby establishing it ﬁrmly as an action for an eﬀective ﬁeld theory at low energies.
We refer to [14, 65, 106] for the details of how all these terms emerge in the calculation.
Most of these terms can also be recovered by an alternative procedure involving Quillen’s
superconnections [48], which seems to suggest that the Chamseddine–Connes action is in
the nature of things. Here we must limit ourselves to the humble computational task of
explaining the general method of extracting such terms from (8.3), by a spectral asymptotic
development in the cutoﬀ parameter Λ.

Spectral densities and asymptotics

→ ∞

We consider the general problem of providing the functional (8.3) with an asymptotic
expansion as Λ
, without prejudging the particular cutoﬀ function φ. In any case, as
we shall see, the dependence of the ﬁnal results on φ is very weak. There is, of course, a
great deal of accumulated experience with the related heat kernel expansion for pseudo-
diﬀerential operators [54]. One can adapt the heat kernel expansion [14] to develop (8.3),
under the tacit assumption that φ is a Laplace transform. However, we take a more direct
route, avoiding the detour through the heat kernel expansion.

The basic idea, expounded in detail in [44], is to develop distributional asymptotics
directly from the spectral density of the positive selfadjoint operator A = D2. If the
spectral projectors of A are

Ces`aro calculus. An important technical issue is how to interpret the distributional
development (8.4). On subtracting the ﬁrst N terms on the right from the left hand side,
one needs a distribution that falls oﬀ like λαN as λ

available also, assuming that one can compute the moments that appear in (8.6). Then one
can evaluate on a test function by a change of variable, obtaining an ordinary asymptotic

The spectral coeﬃcients. The coeﬃcients of the spectral density kernel (8.5), after
integration over ξ, have an intrinsic meaning: in fact, they are all Wodzicki residues! More
precisely, it has been argued in [44] that (8.5) simpliﬁes to

The Chamseddine–Connes action. Pulling all the threads together, we apply the ex-
pansion (8.12) to the action functional (8.3). For the Standard Model plus gravity, we
take n = 4 and A = D2, a generalized Laplacian, acting on a space of sections of a vector

In [14] detailed results are given for the spectral triple associated to the Standard
Model. The bosonic parts of the SM appear in the Λ2 and Λ0 terms; the Einstein–Hilbert
action appears in the Λ2 term, as expected; and other gravity pieces and a gravity-Higgs
coupling in the Λ0 term; the Λ4 term is cosmological. The Λ0 term is conformally invariant.
Higher-order terms may be neglected.

Thus the stage is set for a theory that encompasses gravity and matter ﬁelds on the
same footing. However, it must, when we ﬁnd it, be a fully quantum theory; and that is
for the future.

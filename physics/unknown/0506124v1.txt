Abstract  

 

   

In  a  strong  magnetic  field  and  at  a  high  electronic  density,  electron  pairs  with  parallel 
magnetic moments can form a condensate of magnetized bosons in 0-Landau states with 
vanishing  momentum.  I  use  the  results  of  Rojas  et  al.,  with  nonvanishing  Coulomb 
potential and show that both high electron densities and short intense magnetic intensities 
can be achieved in the one-dimensional shockwaves of hot cathode spots. This allows for 
metastable  charged  electronic  states  at  2Bc/3  as  well  as  for  a  neutral  and  longer  lived 
condensate  of  electron-positron  pairs  that  has  a  lower  energy.  They  typically  condense 
from  one-dimensional  magnetized  electronic  shockwaves  from  unipolar  pulses  on  the 
surface  of  a  discontinuous  conductor  or  cathode  tip,  at  its  extremity,  as  discharges  are 
initiated.  The  thinnest  such  filaments  have  the  Compton  radius  for  the  effective  boson 
mass, and may carry integer units of quantum flux. Open filaments with a few quanta of 
flux  and  several  microns  in  length  are  metastable  in  the  Earth’s  magnetic  field  and  are 
terminated  by  quasi  magnetic  monopoles.  When  perturbed  to  a  higher  density,  they 
would  evolve  towards  a  fragile  expanding  state  with  negative  mass,  vanishing  density 
and B = Bc ~ 8.82 GT, except for those bosons in the condensate that manage to further 
pair up. This could lead to higher critical fields by a process of magnetic fusion. 

The  electron  or  electron-positron  pairs  in  Landau  orbits  about  the  z-axis 
magnetic field behave as vector bosons with energy eigenvalue

Charged states 
 
These simply imply the shift ν = µ -U, ν = ν’ + Μoc2. The solution for the 
condensate is then (13) with the addition of U on the right hand. 

Negative mass states 
 
When B is just below Bc, Mo in (3) as well as µ in (13) are negative. Once 
again, let ν = µ -U  , with ν < 0  and ν = ν’ + Μoc2 as before. Then (11), 
(13) imply that now, the infinitesimal ν’ is positive instead of negative. So 
the  density  of  states  (9)  is  unchanged  and  still  positive  for  a  negative 
effective mass. Such an extreme regime might be avoided by the complete 
pairing of the bosons into ones of mass  2M  and  doubled  critical  field.  The 
process of fusion could continue to higher and higher critical fields.

For B = 1 GT, the negative transverse pressure is -3 x 1014 N/m2, a negative 
energy density of – 3 x 1014 J/m3 that overcomes the positive pressure of the 
dense Fermi gas in astrophysical objects and induces their collapse. This is 
important for the dynamics of condensation. Another important result is the 
disappearance  of  the  large  classical  magnetic  energy  B2/8πc  in  the 
regularization  of ΩV.  In  terms  of  the  negative  energy  per  pair  in  a  typical 
self-magnetized  condensate,  though,  even  at  2Bc/3=5.88  G,  the  remaining 
negative  vacuum  energy  represents  only  20  meV,  which  can  therefore  be 
neglected in the energy balance.

The  full  magnetic  moment  in  (20)  does  not  diverge  when  Mo-  =  0,  only 
when B = Bc. One consequence is the runaway increase in the magnetization

equilibrium value. Another consequence from (14) and (3), is that just below 
Bc, although Mo- < 0, the magnetic moment is positive and diverges. Also, in

If we omit the anomalous term in (25), we find that, for x to be real, 0 ≤ A ≤ 
2/(3√3).  Then,  there  are  two  solutions.  One  has  x2  ≤  2/3  so  the  density  of 
states N increases with the magnetization and is maximal at B = 2Bc/3 and A 
= 2/(3√3). This represents the path to a metastable order. Note the steepness 
of the magnetization close to A= 2/(3√3).

The other solution has N = 0 at B = Bc with x2 decreasing from 1-ε  to 2/3 at 
A = 2/(3√3). Since at B = Bc the magnetic moment becomes infinite and the 
density  of  such  states  infinitesimal,  Rojas  proposed  that  the  overall 
magnetization  is  necessarily  lowered  by  bound  Fermi  electrons  in  n  >  0 
Landau  orbits,  so  that  the  magnetic  field  does  not  exceed  Bc.  But  the 
equation  of  the  state  beyond  2Bc/3  is  just  that  for  the  condensate  itself, 
without  any  assumption  for  an  additional  Fermi  fluid,  and  the  runaway 
magnetization  and  increase  in  magnetic  moment  are  obviously  related  to 
deep  intrinsic  changes  in  the  properties  of  the  magnetized  bosons  the 

condensate is made of, namely the vanishing of their mechanical energy and 
effective mass. A more straightforward interpretation of this solution and of 
the following curve is that as the effective mass of the bosons decreases (is 
divided by some factor Λ), their intrinsic period, their Compton radius and 
magnetic moment all blow up (are multiplied by that same factor Λ), so that 
they  occupy  a  larger  and  larger  transverse  surface,  which  decreases  their 
density  although  their  longitudinal  packing  increases  somewhat  (r  →  r 
(3Λ/2)-1/3) and their magnetization approaches Bc. Classically, this is akin to 
the tendency of the coils in a solenoid carrying a very high current to stick to 
one  another  while  tending  to  expand  radially  into  a  thinner  and  thinner 
equatorial  ring.  How  to  reconcile  this  blow  up  with  the  negative  pressure? 
One  answer  is  that  as  a  larger  volume  of  space  is  magnetized,  a  larger 
volume of classical magnetic energy B2/8πc is also absorbed by the quantum 
regularization  of  the  vacuum  energy  so that  this  expansion  is  accompanied 
by negative work. A little after B > 2Bc/3, the runaway magnetization is very 
steep, and boosts the state straight to the vicinity of Bc = 8.82 GT, where its 
effective mechanical mass becomes negative and equal to αM/2π, which is 
appropriate to the negative pressure, while its magnetic moment diverges. It 
is  of  course  possible  that  this  extreme  regime  is  not  reached  owing  to  the 
complete condensation of the bosons into ones of mass 2M. But the pairing 
is likely to be partial, so that the remaining condensate is likely to proceed 
with  its  expansion.  If  this  divergence  is  actual  near  Bc,  the  state  must  also 
expand longitudinally in this limit. The only constraint lies in the necessary 
electromagnetic mass of the state, which may only be attained by screening 
and/or an additional Fermi fluid. During the radial expansion that follows B 
> 2Bc/3, such a state will necessarily interact with ordinary electronic states 
whose  reaction  to  this  sudden  magnetic  impulse  will  likely  be  strongly 
diamagnetic, from n > 0 Landau states, so as to confine the blast if these are 
external, or damp it if they lie within it. A condensation of some states inside 
the blast is also possible. While I do not deny the phenomenon of magnetic 
damping  from  non-zero  Landau  orbits,  I  nonetheless  do  not  ascribe  to  it  a 
primary and fundamental necessity. In a white dwarf, the first phase of the 
magnetization would imply a transverse collapse of the electronic fluid up to 
2Bc/3, and then its runaway radial and then longitudinal expansion, while the 
electron-depleted  core  undergoes  a  Coulomb  explosion  that  could  be  the 
origin  of  the  highly  energetic  protons  and  nuclei  often  detected  in  cosmic 
rays. In neutron stars, a neutral parapositronic condensate might, as it blows 
up,  initiate  the  magnetization  of  the  nuclear  matter.  Metastable  magnetic 
blobs could also create exotic phenomena in the atmosphere.

During  the  entire  collapse,  as  well  as  when  it  is  complete,  the  total  energy 
for each pair as given above, omitting the missing classical magnetic energy, 
is below its free rest mass. For B = 2Bc/3, U = 262.5 KeV, Mo = 591.6 KeV 
and  their  sum  at  169.4  KeV  below  2mec2.  To  find  their  transverse  or  small 
radius, recall that the filaments become magnetically invisible to their larger 
surroundings  when  the  Dirac  condition  eg  =  nhc/4π    is  met.  In  order  to 
minimize any interaction energy, I assume that the flux is quantized so that a 
single electron does not see it. The flux in any such state is then

When n = 3, this is about the Compton radius for Mo = M/√3. (The density 
in (27), of 2.9 1038[m-3], though of the same order, is about ten times higher 
than from (32) using (28), owing to the higher density needed to reach 2Bc/3 
in the homogeneous volume considered when deriving the equations versus 
in  a  filament.  (This  value  of  2Bc/3  is  independent  from  the  shape  of  the 
condensate or the distribution of its dipoles and related only to the dynamics 
of the stability of the magnetic moment of a spinning particle in a magnetic 
field.)  Also,  the  fact  that  the  distances  between  the  dipoles  are  not 
substantially  larger  than  their  dimensions,  as  assumed  in  (28),  should  be 
taken into account, as well as some classical model for the electronic shape 
and  charge  distribution,  such  as  a  spinning  ring.)  Under  longitudinal 
compression  of  the  filament,  a  runaway  magnetization  ensues  in  which  the 
effective mass vanishes and the Compton radius blows up. 
  

Since the mass of the electrons is mostly electromagnetic and since the exact 
mass of the boson pair is not known, it remains to be seen what the precise 
energy balance for the charged metastable state is: in addition, there might 
be a need for some screening and/or additional bound electronic Fermi fluid. 
The latter can only decrease the magnetization, because B > Bc  e = 4.41GT 
implies that single electron 0-Landau states are forbidden. The longitudinal 
momentum on a ring of radius R is

                                                           (33) 

  
The k ≥ 1 states will each be filled with k bound electrons on the ring, with 
increasing longitudinal momentum pk, and a magnetic moment decreasing as 
~1/γ,  the  inverse  of  the  relativistic  factor,  until  the  mass-to-charge  ratio  of 
the two-fluid state is close to that of free electrons. As for the screening, a 
charged ring state in a dielectric, gaseous or ionized medium tends to ionize 
it  strongly,  as  Meysats  et  al.  have  observed  in  cathode  hot  spots  or  during 
sputtering,  or  Donets  et  al.  in  drift  tube,  low  pressure,  reflex  electronic 
discharges.  As  a  result,  the  potential  is  reduced,  as  is  the  electromagnetic 
mass and the density of the Fermi fluid that might be needed to achieve it. 
  
In a two-fluid condensate at the maximal density and B=2Bc/3, the electrical 
field can be close to 1018 V/m locally, which, in combination with the higher 
than critical magnetic field for single electrons, induces any decay photons 
to spontaneously create magnetized parapositronium bosonic entities, so that 
these  regenerate  as  they  form  a  self  focusing,  confining  medium  for  the 
photons, akin to an optical fiber. 
  
The true ground state for the metastable condensate is then probably made of 
self-regenerating neutral and magnetized parapositronium entities. It is more 
stable because it has the lowest possible energy and depends less on either 
an additional Fermi fluid or extraneous screening, all in delicate balance. Its 
mass  is  just  its  mechanical  rest  mass  plus  the  probably  negative  internal 
potential.  We  now  have  a  self-sustaining,  closed  loop  of  intense  magnetic 
field. It is invisible to its immediate surroundings when quantized, but since 
it  has  a  non-vanishing  volume,  it  will  nonetheless  have  some  cross-section 
for the nuclei or electrons that enter it. 
 
We may assume that the charged state may eventually decay into a neutral 
magnetized  loop  of  flux  by  shedding  electrons  and  photons  as  the  delicate 

balance between the condensate, the screening and the Fermi fluid is upset. 
This  process  would  fit  with  Kenneth  Shoulder’s  observation  of  “White 
EVs”, active, highly charged, bound electronic states that emit electrons and 
~2KeV  photons  (2¦Mo-¦  =  2.34KeV  near  Bc)  when  disturbed  by  external 
fields, while recoiling wildly, until they settle into a lower mass and charge 
quiet  state  he  terms  a  “Black  EV”.  These  would  remain  magnetically 
interactive  with  their  surroundings  when  their  flux  is  not  quantized  (and 
even  when  it  is,  they  still  interact  within  their  non-zero  flux  volume),  and 
could  regenerate  into  the  charged  active  state  by  catalyzing  the  runaway 
magnetization and further capture of nearby atomic electrons. A ‘Dark EV’ 
may  also  acquire  a  net  positive  charge  from  nuclei  undergoing  accelerated 
massive β+ decay and/or electron capture. In case of a stronger disturbance, 
an  EV  would  blow  up  transversely  into  a  critical  field  state.  Unless  this 
happens  in  a  very  dense  electronic  medium,  this  would  lead  to  a  fast 
magnetic  decay  from  electrons  in  diamagnetic  n  >  0  Landau  orbits  and, 
under certain circumstances, to magnetic cooling.  
  
For an open filament of length L to be stable, the ambient field at one pole 
must be stronger than that from the other pole so that

But,  as  suggested  above,  the  magnetic  radius  may  not  be  smaller  than  the 
Compton radius for the effective mass of the bosons. As a result, open n=3 
filaments  longer  than  about  4  and  30  to  500  microns  are  stabilized  in  the 
field at the Earth’s surface and in its immediate vicinity in the solar system, 
respectively. Since it is made of spin up bosons, it aligns its inner field with 
an external field, similarly to a compass needle or a ferromagnetic domain, 
and  strengthens  it  further  along  its  axis.  This,  in  turn  allows  for 
superferromagnets or EVs-enhanced magnets. The sudden expansion of such 
states could allow for even stronger, though fleeting, macroscopic magnetic 
fields.  The  open  neutral  metastable  filament  is  a  monopole-antimonopole 
pair,  similar  to  Kiehn’s  Falaco  soliton.  The  magnetic  poles  observed  by 
Urutskoiev  et  al.  after  strong  discharges  could  actually  be  open  neutral 
filaments  of  several  microns  in  length  that  move  in  the  magnetic  gradients 
near  ferromagnetic  materials  that  then  capture  them,  rather  than  free 
magnetic monopoles. The limited lifetime of such entities, of several hours, 
as  well  as  their  decay  would  suggest  it,  since  a  fundamental  particle,  and 

especially  one  carrying  a  magnetic  charge,  should  be  stable.  It  is  therefore 
expected  that  a  ferromagnetic  material  with  anomalous  magnetization  will 
not  leave  the  typical  signature  of  monopoles  when  passed  through  a 
superconducting loop. Open neutral filaments shorten progressively as they 
decay, so that the longer filaments have the longest lives, which may reach 
days  or  weeks.  They  may  also  seed  the  formation  of  charged  states.  The 
newly  formed  charged  filaments  have  lifetimes  of  fractions  of  a  second, 
while  the  largest  and  most  stable  of  them  may  last  a  few  tens  of  seconds. 
They typically evolve into their neutral counterparts when not disturbed too 
much.  Both  types  may  explode  when  driven  beyond  2Bc/3    if  no  further 
pairing  of  the  bosons  occur,  and  this  could  initiate  the  formation  of  new 
metastable filaments in a properly prepared medium. 

 

How are such filaments formed? 

They  typically  result  from  the  runaway  magnetization  that  initiates  at  the 
density of matter, from 0-Landau electronic states in a closed flux, ring-like 
microscopic electronic shockwave. The critical density can be reached from 
very short, negative unipolar pulses traveling on a wire or transmission line 
(ideally,  a  nonlinear  pulse-shortening  transmission  line),  when  the  current 
spike, already squeezed on the surface by the skin effect in the trailing edge 
of the pulse’s voltage (the leading edge current can be nonexistent owing to 
the  self-inductance  while  the  trailing  edge  current  is  enhanced),  reaches  a 
discontinuity  such  as  the  tip  of  a  truncated  conical  cathode;  often,  a  small 
asperity  on  its  end  surface  (in  that  case,  the  nonlinearity  is  created  by  the 
breakdown of the oxide dielectric coating it and by its extrusion, meltdown 
just  prior  to  vaporization  that  fleetingly  concentrates  most  of  the  current.) 
There,  electronic  wave-packets  of  the  squeezed  current  pulse  are  suddenly 
reflected. In a bounded conductor at equilibrium, such as a cube of copper, 
the conduction-band electrons are continuously reflected off the boundaries, 
but their density is that of motionless, delocalized standing waves, so that no 
charge  density  pulse  is  dynamically  reflected  at  the  walls  and  no  motional 
electric field ensues. Here however, there appears a huge motional electric 
field -∂tA that initiates the discharge, slows the internally reflected electrons 
and  rushes  the  remainder  of  the  trailing  edge  electrons  against  the 
magnetized perimeter of the cathode’s accidental micro-tip. It also attracts a 
delayed cloud of positive ions to the cathode, in its axis. 

In a cathode hot spot, the electric current typically reaches about 1012A/m2, 
which would imply an equilibrium magnetic field of several Tesla at most.

we  see  that  the  magnetic  field  also  results  from  the  time-variation  of  the 
dielectric displacement, both from the sudden increase in the electric field, 
as the current pulse is being reflected at the tip, which draws a positive cloud 
towards it that further enhances the effect as it approaches in the axis of the 
cathode’s  tip,  and  from  a  fast  increase  in  the  electric  permittivity  as  the 
dielectric  medium  at  the  interface  is  being  highly  excited,  both  electrically 
and magnetically, while the magnetic field preserves its dielectric strength, 
prior to ionization. It is well known that the dielectric susceptibility of atoms 
increases  with  their  volume  and  as  the  sixth  power  of  their  main  quantum 
number  n.  As  the  atoms  at  the  boiling  interface  are  excited  to  n~10,  their 
susceptibility suddenly increases by a factor of one million, which results in 
a jump in the overall dielectric constant of several units in a time of the order 
of one nanosecond, or shorter. Seeing as the conductivity tensor is an inverse 
function  of  the  magnetic  field,  the  dielectric  breakdown  is  damped,  the 
avalanche  of  a  discharge  cannot  initiate  nor  the  medium  be  yet  ionized  so 
that it behaves as an enhanced dielectric. Typically in (36), 

R ~ O(1µ), ∆t < 1ns , ∆εr ~ O(1), ∆Ε > 105V/m                (37) 

Therefore,  at  the  interface  round  the  micro-tip,  the  intensity  of  the  fast 
magnetic  pulse  that  surrounds  the  electronic  shockwave  may  reach  several 
billion  Tesla.  Obviously,  the  electrons  in  the  shockwave  will  penetrate  the 
adjacent flux ring thus created and become even more densely bound within 
it  in  0-Landau  states.  Moreover,  the  magnetic  susceptibility  of  atoms  is 
known to increase in very high fields. This, along with increasing numbers 
of  electrons  in  0-Landau  states,  contributes  to  a  higher  permeability  µ  in 
(36).  So  we  have  our  ring-shaped,  one-dimensional,  dense  and  magnetized 

electronic shockwave round the micro-tip and the results of Rojas et al. can 
now be applied. 

Condensation  into  filaments  can  occur  when  z-pinch  discharges  break  up 
owing  to  the  sausage  instability,  which  create  very  localized  and  dense 
discontinuities  that  explain  the  substantial  non-thermal  fusion  reaction  and 
neutron emission rates that have long been observed when such discharges 
break up. The same happens in metallic conductors when subjected to very 
high current spikes: they fragment from the Laplace pinch pressure as well 
as  from  the  longitudinally  repulsive  electrical  forces  of  their  positively 
charged core and negatively charged surface owing, again, to the skin effect, 
and can then condense magnetized paired electron ring states as the current 
is reflected off the micro-discontinuities of the freshly broken conductor. A 
similar  phenomenon  has  also  been  observed  by  Meysats  et  al.  or  by  the 
Correas  during  the  sputtering  of  metals  in  vacuum  from  the  small  droplet 
instabilities  of  hot  spots  that  appear  on  a  solid  plane  cathode  (the  thermal 
energy  released  in  the  nuclear  reactions  from  the  newly  created  EVs  that 
form  on  any  micro-asperity  contributes),  and  by  Donets  et  al.  in  electronic 
pulsed  reflex  discharges  in  low  pressure  drift  tubes,  where  the  pulsed 
electronic  discharges  are  first  squeezed  by  the  mirror  charges  in  the  drift 
tube,  then  form  shockwaves  and  “electron  filaments”  when  reflected  at  the 
ends. 

Both the region near the axis of the ring at the reflecting tip and the region 
surrounding  it  are  electron-depleted.  This  helps  screen  the  potential,  which 
reduces  the  critical  threshold  and  the  density  of  the  accompanying  Fermi 
states. 

As  the  ferromagnetic  condensate  forms,  the  original  magnetic  field  is 
amplified, and soon, electrons from the conduction band shockwave or from 
atoms  magnetized  beyond  the  critical  field  of  4.41GT  for  single  electrons, 
join  it  or  bind  to  it.  The  nuclei  thus  magnetically  stripped  can  form  a 
metastable,  condensed,  highly  magnetized,  electronically  screened  state  in 
which  both  nuclear  fusion  reactions  and  accelerated  beta  transmutations 
occur,  as  the  condensate  and  its  accompanying  Fermi  fluid  are  very  dense 
sources  of  polarized  electrons  interacting  with  highly  polarized  nuclear 
targets. Or, such stripped atoms are expelled as multiply ionized entities, as 
shown by Donets et al. 

In the presence of an axial magnetic field, a newly-formed singularity may no 
longer  close  into  a  ring,  and  would  uncoil  into  an  open  filament  under  the 
influence  of  the  external  axial  field  that  also  stabilizes  it.  It  will  therefore  be 
more  active  in  its  initial  stages  and  may  eventually  decay  into  a  pseudo 
monopole-antimonopole pair, if left to evolve quietly while shedding its charge. 

Interestingly, the observation of monopoles by Ehrenhaft since the 1930’s and by 
Mikhailov  since  the  1980’s  has  involved  particles  created  by  the  sputtering  of 
ferromagnetic  materials  in  electrical  arcs,  while  those  recently  observed  by 
Urutskoev  et  al.  were  produced  in  exploding  discharges  and  only  later  bound 
themselves to ferromagnetic materials. In the observations of Mikhailov, a small, 
open  magnetic  filament terminated by magnetic poles and oriented in an almost 
homogeneous  magnetic  field,  bound  to  a  ferromagnetic  particle,  will  see  the 
magnetization of one of its poles enhanced by a circularly polarized beam of light, 
while  at  the  other  pole,  it  is  diminished.  One  may  also  think  in  terms  of 
asymmetric  momentum  transfer  from  the  photons  to  the  poles  by  the  magneto-
optical effect. The strength of the apparent magnetic charges might vary according 
to whether one is actually observing a magnetic dipole and it will depend on its 
length, on the magnetic flux in the filament, on the gradient of the external field 
and  whether  some  flux  is  returned  by  a  nearby  ferromagnetic.  Urutskoev  et  al. 
observed  caterpillar-like  dual  traces  in  films  that  could  well  be  the  poles 
terminating a neutral filament. The fact that the anomalous magnetization created 
by  such  poles  in  iron  disappears  after  several  hours  supports  the  view  of  a  non 
elementary  particle,  whose  magnetic  charge  would  have  otherwise  been 
conserved. It indicates that the neutral, open filaments linking the poles decay, and 
that  their  lifetime  is  proportional  to  their  length.  Such  filaments  should  carry 
longitudinal, in part irreversible, magneto-acoustic excitations between their poles 
so long as their magnetization is below 2Bc/3.

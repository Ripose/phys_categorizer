1.  Introduction 

The infrared spectroscopy of the acetylene molecule C2H2 is of interest for theoretical, 
atmospheric,  planetary,  astrophysical,  metrological  and  industrial  applications  [1].  In 
particular, experimental laboratory detection of weak lines from C2H2 hot bands can help in 
improving  global  treatment  of  acetylene  in  its  ground  state  using  effective  Hamiltonian 
approaches and in modeling the dense spectra from circumstellar envelopes or giant planets 
atmosphere.  

0+ν5

The 2.5 µm domain is the seat of perpendicular bands of  12C2H2 and its isotopologues. 
Strong Q branches may make it interesting for applications linked to its detection in various 
1 and 
media. However, the region has not been extensively investigated yet. The strong ν3+ν4
1  bands  of  12C2H2,  respectively  centered  at  3897  and  3881 cm−1,  have  been 
ν2+2ν4
observed by Palmer et al [2] and by Lafferty and Pine [3].  Two cold and five hot bands from 
absorption Doppler-limited 12C2H2 spectra with pressure-path length products at most equal to 
96  Torr.m,  have  been  analyzed  by  D’Cunha  et  al  [4].  As  far  as  the  other  isotopologues  are 
concerned, only a cold band and three hot bands from 12C2HD  have been reported [5]. 

Intracavity  laser  absorption  is  a  powerful  approach  to  the  spectroscopy  of  weak 
transitions.  The  absorbing  sample  is  placed  inside  a  broad  gain  bandwidth  laser  cavity. 
Broadband losses are compensated by the laser gain unlike spectrally selective losses mostly 
due to the sample absorption lines. Most often, the multimode laser is pulsed mode operated. 
Then, absorption is expected to follow the Lambert-Beer law with path length L = c tg, where 
c  is  the  velocity  of  light  and  tg  is  the  generation  time,  separating  the  population  inversion 
threshold  from  the  observation.  Equivalent  absorption  path  length  of  several  tens  of 
kilometers can be achieved, resulting in high detection sensitivities. Spectra cover several tens 
of reciprocal centimeters.  

Recently  we  reported  [6]  implementation  of  high  resolution  Time-Resolved  Fourier 
Transform  IntraCavity  Laser  Absorption  Spectroscopy  (called  hereafter  TRFT-ICLAS). 
Coupling  a  Cr2+:ZnSe  laser  with  a  stepping  mode  interferometer, we were able [7] to reach 
the  2.5  µm  region,  extreme  infrared  limit  ever  reached  by  ICLAS  with  Doppler-limited 
resolution. Since, improved experimental setup enabled to record new spectra. In this letter, 
we  briefly  report  the  latest  implementation,  describe  the  recorded  spectra  and  present  the 
analysis of weak acetylene bands between 3910 and 4030 cm-1.  
 

2.  Experimental 

The  experimental  set-up  is  schematized  on  Figure  1.  A  multimode  Cr2+:ZnSe  laser  is 
optically  pumped  by  a  1607  nm  Er3+-fiber  laser.  An  acousto-optic  modulator  chops  the 
pumping  power  above  and  below  the  Cr2+:ZnSe  threshold  in  order  to  initiate  its  spectro-
temporal  dynamics.  The  pump  is  focused  on  a  4-mm  long  Cr2+:ZnSe  Brewster-cut  crystal. 
The  Cr2+:ZnSe  laser  comprises  a  four-mirror  astigmatism-compensated  X-shaped  resonator. 
M1 and M2 are highly reflective (HR) spherical mirrors with a reflection coefficient equal to 
99.8% between 3700 and 4300 cm-1 and a radius of curvature equal to 75 mm and 100 mm 
respectively. M3 and output coupler OC are HR plane mirrors, with the same coating as M1 
and M2. The small portion (T<0.2%) of light leaking outside OC is sent to the stepping-mode 
interferometer. Use of an OC with a much smaller transmission than in [7] (0.2 % instead of 
6%)  dramatically  improves  the  laser  dynamics  and  enables  higher  absorption  path  lengths 
excursions. The threshold under cw operation is as low as 37 mW. No wavelength selective 
element  is  inserted  inside  the  cavity  and  consequently  no  attempt  to  tune  the  laser  is  made. 
The Cr2+:ZnSe cavity is inside a vacuum enclosure. In order to get rid of strong atmospheric 
absorption from water vapor, the laser is first evacuated under secondary vacuum conditions 
(of the order of 10-2 Pa =10-4 mbar) and then filled with the C2H2 gas. This procedure with no 
need of insertion of a gas cell in the cavity provides the benefits of optimal cavity filling ratio

and of no restriction of the spectral domain width otherwise degraded by additional losses due 
to the cell windows. The interferometer is operated under primary vacuum. It is equipped with 
a  CaF2  beamsplitter  and  two  liquid  nitrogen  cooled  InSb  detectors.  The  rise  time  of  these 
detectors is about 0.5 µs and this represents the actual time resolution limitation. The TRFT-
ICLAS  data  acquisition  procedure  has  been  detailed  elsewhere  [6].  Briefly,  the  whole 
acquisition  procedure  is  computer-driven.  At  given  path  difference  step,  the  time  sampling 
process is triggered by an InGaAs photodiode receiving a small portion of the pumping beam. 
In  order  to  improve  dynamic  range  of  the  measurement,  detector  signals  delivered  at  two 
outputs of the Connes-type interferometer are balanced and subtracted. This removes the dc 
component from the interferogram [8]. An analog-to-digital-converter acquisition board (500-
MHz, 8 bits) digitalizes this interferometric signal. A digital input/output device synchronizes 
data acquisition and interferometer step-scan procedure. Several laser shots may be co-added 
in order to improve the signal to noise ratio. The same time-sampling is repeated at each path 
difference  step,  up  to  maximum  path  difference.  Finally  as  many  interferograms  as  time-
samples  per  step  are  collected.  Each  transformed  interferogram  is  a  complete  absorption 
spectrum  at  a  given  generation  time  or  in  other  words,  thanks  to  ICLAS  with  a  given 
equivalent  absorption  length.  The  pulse-to-pulse  variability  and  frequency  drifts  of  the 
optimized laser have been especially looked at and as they are found to be negligible, they are 
consequently not taken care of during the recording procedure. 

Five  high-resolution  acetylene  time-resolved  intracavity  absorption  spectra  have  been 
recorded,  with  different  pressures.  The  recording  conditions  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  A 
natural  abundance  acetylene  sample  (L’Air  Liquide,  Purity>99.6%)  is  used  at  room 
temperature  (296  ±  0.5  K)  and  its  pressure  is  monitored  with  a  Baratron  gauge.  Figure  2 
provides an intermediate-resolution (0.07 cm-1) representation of the time-resolved spectrum 
nb.  505.  For  clarity,  only  one  time-component  out  of  5  is  displayed,  from  time-component 
nb.5  to  nb.60,  without  normalization.  Their  maximum  intensity  evolves  like  the  total  laser 
intensity  shown  on  Figure  3.  Actually,  the  spectrum,  which  results  from  a  252  minutes 
experiment,  has  64  time-components.  Each  time-component  is  made  of  80,000  independent 
spectral samples. The time component nb. 5 (23.2 µs corresponding to L = 7.0 km), extends 
on 120 cm-1 centered at 3965 cm-1. At 9.2 10-3 cm-1 full unapodized resolution, its signal to 
noise  ratio  is  at  most  50.  Its  corresponding  minimum detectable absorption coefficient is of 
the order of  2.9 10-8 cm-1. As expected, the envelope of the spectrum gets sharper and more 
intense  with  increasing  generation  times.  The  time-component  nb.  60,  (111.2  µs, 
corresponding  to  L  =  33.3  km)  is  about  50  cm-1  broad.  With  the  0.07  cm-1  intermediate 
resolution  shown  on  the  figure,  the  minimum  detectable  absorption  coefficient  of  this  time-
component  is  about  3.5  10-9  cm-1.  Strong  fringes  originating  from  intracavity  etalon  effect 
appear  at  higher  resolution  and  increase  with  generation  time.  Doppler-limited  long 
generation times time-components consequently appear with a degraded signal-to-noise ratio. 
No  attempt  was  undertaken  to  suppress  them  and  the  C2H2  analysis  was  made  on  Doppler-
limited  time-components  with  generation  time  uppermost  values  of  the  order  of  30  µs.  The 
total intensity variation of the laser beam is given on Figure 3. The evolution versus the time 
of the peak absorbance of five acetylene lines is also shown on the figure. The absorbance is 
simply  defined  as  ln(1-Ia/I0)  with  Ia  absorption  at  line  center  and  I0  local  background.    The 
linearity  of  the  evolution  demonstrates  the  validity  of  the  equation  L  =  c  tg  in  the 
corresponding time domain ( tg < 110 µs ). 

 
3.  Analysis 

Recorded spectra are highly congested and exhibit essentially lines never measured or 
even predicted before [2-5, 9-11]. The wavenumber scales are calibrated using residual water 
vapor lines, with data from [12]. The accuracy of the acetylene line positions is of the order of

10-3 cm-1. Assignments reported in this paper were greatly facilitated by the use of Loomis–
Wood  programs  [13,14].  However  about  55  %  of  the  measured  lines  remain  unassigned, 
among which many are obviously part of polynomial series. 
Identified  bands  are  given  in  Table  2.  The  ν2+2ν4

−1  band  of  12C2H2  is  newly 
detected. It was recognized with predictions and assignments from the effective Hamiltonian 
developed  by  [15,  16].  The  remaining  thirteen  12C2H2  bands  have  already  been  observed  by 
[2,4,11]  and  their  lines  reported  here  extend  previous  measurements  towards  high  J  values. 
1 band has already been observed [5]. Two bands with strong Q branches, 
The  12C2HD ν1+ν5
respectively centered at 3953.7 and 4005.0 cm-1, are also present in the spectra. They could 
not  be  assigned  using  constants  from  observed  or  predicted  vibrational  levels,  of  any 
acetylene isotopologue, available in the literature, especially from [9,10]. We have assigned 
1  transitions  of  12C13CH2,  using 
these  two  bands  respectively  to  the  ν1+ν4
predictions  of  the  upper  state  levels  based  on  isotopic  shifts.  Their  absorption  is  consistent 
with the abundance of 12C13CH2 (2.197 %) in a natural sample and the expected intensity of a 
cold  band.  These  attributions  have  been  confirmed  by  the  retrieved  principal  rotational 
constants  Bv  and  their  comparison  with  the  calculated  values  from  the  spectroscopic 
parameters  given  in  [10,17].  Figure  4  displays  a  small  high-resolution  portion  of  time-
component nb.5 of spectrum 505 showing the Q-branch of the ν1+ν4

1 band of 12C13CH2.

fits are given in Table 2. Table 3 reports the calculated constants of the levels obtained from 
−1 transition of 12C2H2 and of the transitions belonging to the 12C2HD 
the fits of the ν2+2ν4
and 12C13CH2 acetylene isotopologues. The lower state constants in the table are held fixed in 
the  fitting  procedure  and  are  taken  in  Ref.[5,10,18].  12C2H2  effective  constants  from  the 
already  observed  bands  are  not  given  since  wavenumbers  of  the  higher  J  value  observed 
transitions strongly deviate from a polynomial model due to perturbations.  
A  list  of  observed  line  positions  of  the  seventeen  bands  with  assignments  and  (obs.-calc.) 
values is attached to this paper as supplementary material. Comparison with the experimental 
line  positions  from  the  bands  reported  by  [2-4]  is  difficult  because  we  only  share  the 
observation  of  a  few  common  high  J  lines,  which  are  often  saturated  and  blended  in  our 
spectra.  Selected  isolated  lines  give  an  agreement  better  than  10-3  cm-1,  but  the  overall 
agreement is within ± 5 10-3 cm-1
. There is no overlapping between the rotational lines of the 
1 bands reported here and those

4. Conclusion 

A  new  experimental  set-up,  based  on  time-resolved  Fourier  transform  intracavity 
Cr2+:ZnSe laser absorption and dedicated to high sensitivity spectroscopy in the 2.5 µm mid-
infrared  region,  has  been  applied  to  the  spectroscopy  of  C2H2.  Line  positions  of  seventeen 
vibrational bands, including two new transitions, of acetylene are reported in a spectral region 
where laboratory spectra are missing. The strong percentage of lines which remain unassigned 
shows  however  that  broader  experimental  spectral  coverage  and  refined  models  including 
most abundant isotopologues transitions are needed.

Figure Captions 

Figure  1:  Schematic  representation  of  the  TRFT-ICLAS  experimental  set-up.  An  Er-doped 
fiber laser is chopped by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) and is focused by a lens (L) on 
the Cr2+:ZnSe crystal for optical pumping. A portion of the pumping beam is collected by a 
photodetector (PD) which triggers the data acquisition. The Cr2+:ZnSe laser resonator is made 
of the highly-reflective spherical M1, M2 and plane M3 mirrors and OC output coupler. The 
dashed  rectangle  represents  the  vacuum-tight  chamber.  The  light  leaking  out  the  cavity  is 
analyzed  by  a  high  resolution  Fourier  spectrometer  and  is  detected  by  two  InSb 
photodetectors (PD). A personal computer (PC) drives the whole experimental procedure. 

Figure  2:  C2H2  time-resolved  spectrum  made  of  64  time-components.  Only  one  time-
component out of five has been plotted, starting from time-component nb.5. On the plot, two 
consecutive components, at an intermediate 0.07 cm-1 apodized resolution, are 8 µs from each 
other. This corresponds to a 2.4-kilometer increase of the equivalent absorbing path L.   

 
Figure 3: Experimental values of the peak absorbance for five acetylene lines together with 
the  dependence  of  the  total  laser  intensity  versus  time.  Time  origin  is  set  when  optical 
pumping is switched  on. Generation time actually begins when population inversion reaches 
its  threshold.  For  a  transition-metal  ion  doped  solid-state  laser  such  as  Cr2+:ZnSe,  this  may 
take several microseconds. Consequently peak absorbance value appears not to be zero at zero 
time.  
 

Figure 4: High resolution portion of time-component nb.5 of TRFT-ICLAS spectrum nb.505 
1  of  12C13CH2.  Acetylene  pressure  is  673  Pa. 
showing  the  Q  branch  of  the  band  ν1+ν4
Absorption  path  length  is  7.0  km  (tg=23.2  µs).  On  the  plot,  the  spectrum  is  apodized 
(resolution: 18.4 10-3 cm-1)  Stars indicate residual water lines.

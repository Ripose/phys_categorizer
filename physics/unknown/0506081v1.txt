 It is shown that in a nonmagnetized plasma, beside the longitudinal 
Langmuir resonance, there may also exist the transversal resonance. Both 
these resonance kinds are degenerated. Employment of the transversal reso-
nance makes it possible to design resonators and filters, as well as powerful 
single-frequency lasers operating on the basis of collective oscillations of 
plasma. 

Introduction 

 
        Up to date it has been generally assumed that in a nonmagnetized plasma 
there may exist only one, so-called Langmuir resonance. The processes featuring it 
are associated with time-variation of the plasma density. As is well known, such a 
resonance is incapable of radiating electromagnetic waves in the longitudinal di-
rection.  
        However, it is known that an explosion, for example of an atomic bomb, re-
sults in electromagnetic radiation in a very wide frequency band, up to radio-
frequency band. While the radiation in a light band can be readily explained by ra-
diation of separate atoms, the radiation in a radio-frequency band can be condi-
tioned only by collective processes taking place in a hot plasma. 

Revealing and describing of such processes is the objective of the present 

                   
 
                 Electrodynamics of nonmagnetized plasma 

 
 Primarily we shall assume that we deal with a plasma medium in which 
there are no losses. For example, a superconductor is an ideal plasma medium 
where charge carriers may move without friction. In this case  the equation of mo-
tion is

 As Eq. (7) shows, the inductivities of plasma (both electric and magnetic) 
are frequency – independent and equal to the corresponding parameters for vac-
uum. Besides, such plasma has another fundamental material characteristic – ki-
netic inductivity.

 It is shown below that under certain conditions this resonance can be trans-
verse with respect to the direction of electromagnetic waves. 
It is known that the Langmuir resonance is longitudinal. No other resonances have 
ever been detected in nonmagnetized plasma. Nevertheless, transverse resonance is 
also possible in such plasma, and its frequency coincides with that of the Langmuir 
resonance. To understand the origin of the transverse resonance, let us consider a 
long line consisting of two perfectly conducting planes (see Fig. 1).

Earlier, we introduced this magnitude by another way (see Eq. (4)). 

Eq. (38) corresponds to case of uniformly distributed d.c. current. 
          As we can see from Eq. (37),  LHS  , unlike  CЕS and  LkS , decreases when  z 
grows. This is clear physically because the number of parallel-connected inductive 
elements increases with growing  z.  The equivalent circuit of the line with      non-
dissipative plasma is shown in Fig.  2 б. The line itself is equivalent to a parallel 
lumped circuit:

         This brings us to a very interesting result: the resonance frequency of the 
macroscopic resonator is independent of its size. It may seem that we are dealing 
here with the Langmuir resonance because the obtained frequency corresponds ex-
actly to that of the Langmuir resonance. We however know that the Langmuir 
resonance characterizes longitudinal waves. The wave propagating in the phase ve-
locity in the  z-direction is equal to infinity and the wave vector is

 is the velocity of light in vacuum. 

For the plasma under consideration, the phase velocity of the electromag-
netic wave is equal to infinity. Hence, the distribution of the fields and currents 
over the line is uniform at each instant of time and independent of the  z-coordinate. 
This implies that, on the one hand, the inductance  LHS has no effect on the electro-
dynamic processes in the line and, on the other hand, any two planes can be used 
instead of conducting planes to confine plasma above and below.  

Eqs. (41) , (42) and (43) indicate that we have transverse resonance with an 

infinite Q-factor. The fact of transverse resonance, i.e. different from the Langmuir 
resonance, is most obvious when the  Q-factor is not equal to infinity. Then  kz „
 0 
and the transverse wave is propagating in the line along the direction perpendicular 
to the movement of charge carriers. True, we started our analysis with plasma con-
fined within two planes of a long line, but we have thus found that the presence of 
such resonance is entirely independent of the line size, i.e. this resonance can exist 
in an infinite medium. Moreover, in infinite plasma transverse resonance can coex-
ist with the Langmuir resonance characterizing longitudinal waves. Since the fre-
quencies of these resonances coincide, both of them are degenerate. Earlier, the 
possibility of transverse resonance was not considered. To approach the problem 
more comprehensively, let us analyze the energy processes in loss-free plasma. 

The characteristic resistance of plasma determining the relation between the 

transverse components of electric and magnetic fields can be found from

charge carriers. It turns out that in addition to the electric and magnetic waves car-

Hence, to find the total specific energy accumulated in unit volume of plasma, it is 
not sufficient to allow only for the fields  Е and Н. 

At the point w = wr

                     WE = Wk  , 

i.e. there is no magnetic field in the plasma, and the plasma is a macroscopic elec-
tromechanical cavity resonator of frequency  wr.. 

At w >  wr the wave propagating in plasma carries three types of energy – 

magnetic, electric and kinetic. Such wave can therefore be-called magnetoelec-

trokinetic. The kinetic wave is a current-density wave 

. It is shifted 

by p /2 with respect to the electric wave. 

Up to now we have considered a physically unfeasible case with no losses in 
plasma, which corresponds to infinite  Q-factor of the plasma resonator. If losses 
occur, no matter what physical processes caused them, the  Q-factor of the plasma 
resonator is a final quantity. For this case the Maxwell equations become

The term  sр.ef E
emphasizes that we are interested in the fact of loss and do not care of its mecha-
nism. Nevertheless, even though we do not try to analyze the physical mechanism 
of loss, we should be able at least to measure  sр.ef. 

For this purpose, we choose a line segment of the length 

z0, which is much 

shorter than the wavelength in dissipative plasma. This segment is equivalent to a 
circuit with the following lumped parameters

There is of course some uncertainty in this approach because the surface imped-

though the approach is simplified, the qualitative results are quite adequate. True, a

 Practical aspects 
 
Plasma can be used first of all to construct a macroscopic single-frequency 
cavity for development of a new class of electrokinetic plasma lasers. Such cavity 
can also operate as a band-pass filter.  
pQ  the magnetic field energy near the transverse resonance 
 At high enough 
is considerably lower than the kinetic energy of the current carriers and the electro-
static field energy. Besides, under certain conditions the phase velocity can much 
exceed the velocity of light. Therefore, if we want to excite the transverse plasma 
resonance, we can put

 Transverse plasma resonance offers another important application – it can be 
used to heat plasma. High-level electric fields and, hence, high change-carrier en-
ergies can be obtained in the plasma resonator if its 
Q-factor is high, which is 
achievable at low concentrations of plasma. Such cavity has the advantage that the 
charges attain the highest velocities far from cold planes. Using such charges for 
nuclear fusion, we can keep the process far from the cold elements of the resona-
tor. 
 

Let us pay special attention on that, in this case, when the plasma is bounded 
(similar to a case of two-wire circuit), it is possible to perform selective heating of 
the plasma. We keep in mind that such a resonator will resonate separately both at  
frequencies of electron and ion plasma resonance. This is associated with that, in a 
case of bounded plasma, at frequencies that are considerably lower than ones of 
electron plasma resonance, the electrons will practically instantly follow the field. 
This will result in that the electrons synchronously following the field will cause a 
certain gradient of the charge density and will form in such a way some compen-
sating field directed against the primary field. The strength of this compensating 
field will be independent on the frequency in the frequency band mentioned. 
           In spite of that the electrons will exert a stabilizing action, and the field 
strength between the pates will be less than in the case of electron absence, yet an 
alternating field between the plates will exists. In the given case, a low-frequency

resonance will occur in that case when the external frequency will coincide with 
the ion resonance frequency. Note that the possibility of separate heating of the 
electron and ion plasma components has been absent till now. There was only the 
possibility of heating of the electron component, whereas for implementation on 
thermonuclear synthesis just heating of the ion component is needed. When con-
sidering this issue we imply that the conducting plates themselves of the circuit are 
conductively isolated from the volume occupied by the plasma.  
           Such plasma resonator can be matched easily to the communication line. In-
deed, the equivalent resistance of the resonator at the point  w = wр  is

 There is however another reason for this serious mistake in the present-day 
physics [1] as an example. This study states that there is no difference between di-
electrics and conductors at very high frequencies. On this basis the authors suggest 
the existence of a polarization vector in conducting media and this vector is intro-
duced from the relation

where  n is the charge carrier density, 
approach is physically erroneous because only bound charges can polarize and 
form electric dipoles when the external field overcoming the attraction force of the 
bound charges accumulates extra electrostatic energy in the dipoles. In conductors 
the charges are not bound and their displacement would not produce any extra 
electrostatic energy. This is especially obvious if we employ the induction tech-
nique to induce current (i.e. to displace charges) in a ring conductor. In this case 
there is no restoring force to act upon the charges, hence, no electric polarization is 
possible. In  [1] the polarization vector found from Eq. (71) is introduced into the 
electric induction of conducting media

The interpretation of  e(w) as frequency-dependent inductivity has been harmful 
for correct understanding of the real physical picture (especially in the educational 
processes). Besides, it has drawn away the researchers attention from some physi-
cal phenomena in plasma, which first of all include the transverse plasma reso-
nance and three energy components of the magnetoelectrokinetic wave propagating 
in plasma.

Abstract:

A  series  of  Silicon  crystal  undulator  samples  were  produced  based  on  the
approach presented in PRL 90 (2003) 034801, with the periods of undulation
from  0.1  mm  to  1  mm,  and  the  number  of  periods  on  the  order  of  10.  The
samples  were  characterized  by  X-rays,  revealing  the  sine-like  shape  of  the
crystal  lattice  in  the  bulk.  Next  step  in  the  characterization  has  been  the
channeling tests done with 70 GeV protons, where good channeling properties
of the undulated Silicon lattice have been observed. The photon radiation tests
of  crystal  undulators  with  high  energy  positrons  are  in  progress  on  several
locations: IHEP Protvino, LNF Frascati, and CERN SPS. The progress in the
experimental  activities  and  the  predictions  from  detailed  simulations  are
reported.

Key words:

crystal channeling; undulator; radiation.

INTRODUCTION

Many areas of modern science and engineering require intense sources of
high-energy X-ray and gamma beams. Efficient sources of such radiation are
electron  or  positron  beams  traversing  an  undulated  magnetic  field  in
accelerators.  However, 
the  usual  electromagnetic  undulators  have  a
relatively  large  period  of  magnetic  structure,  which  limits  the  energy  of

generated  radiation.  The  energy  of  a  photon  emitted  in  an  undulator  is  in
proportion  to  the  square  of  the  particle  Lorentz  factor  γ  and  in  inverse
proportion to the undulator period L: ћω≈2πћγ2c/L. Typically, at the modern
accelerators the period of undulator in the synchrotron light sources is a few
centimeters1.  With  a  strong  worldwide  attention  to  novel  sources  of
radiation,  there  has  been  broad  interest  2-11  to  compact  undulators  based  on
channeling in crystals, where a strong periodic electric field exists by nature.
The  crystalline  undulators  with  periodically  deformed  crystallographic
planes  offer  electromagnetic  fields  in  the  order  of  1000  Tesla  and  could
provide a period L in sub-millimeter range. This way, a hundred-fold gain in
the  energy  of  emitted  photons  would  be  reached,  as  compared  to  a  usual
undulator.

The  use  of  bent  crystals  for  channeling  extraction  of  beams  from
accelerators  has  been  under  development  at  several  laboratories12-17.  A
collaboration of researchers working at the 70-GeV accelerator of IHEP has
achieved  a  substantial  progress  in  the  efficiency  of  crystal-assisted  beam
deflection:  extraction  efficiency  larger  than  85%  is  obtained  at  intensity  as
high as 1012 protons17. Since 1999, the use of bent crystals to extract beams
for the high energy physics program became regular in all accelerator runs of
U-70.  About  one  half  of  all  extracted  beams  with  intensities  up  to  1012  at
IHEP are now obtained with channeling crystals. The efficient practical use
of  crystal  channeling  elements  for  steering  of  particle  beams  at  modern
accelerators  has  been  another  major  motivation  for  research  towards  a
crystal channeling undulator.

THE REALIZED TECHNIQUE OF CU

The first idea on how to make an undulated crystal lattice was ultrasound,
suggested in 1979 by Kaplin et al4. Later on, in 1984, Ikezi et al6 proposed a
Si1-xGex/Si  graded  composition  lattice  with  periodical  modulation  of  Ge
content  x.  More  recently,  Avakian  et  al11  suggested  to  apply  a  periodic
surface  strain  on  crystal  wafer.  These  ideas  have  been  theoretically
they  are  still  pending  realization.  Recently2,3  we
developed4-11  but 
demonstrated experimentally by means of X-rays that microscratches on the
crystal surface make sufficient stresses for creation of a crystalline undulator
(CU) by making a series of scratches with a period of sub-millimeter range.
This  method  is  based  on  an  interesting  observation  in  our  earlier  70-GeV
proton  channeling  experiments  ref.12,  p.120,  where  it  was  found  that
accidental micro-scratches on a crystal surface cause a significant deflection
of high-energy particles near the scratch (see photo, Fig.1).

On this photo, a fragment of the end face of crystal and an image of the
beam deflected by this crystal are presented. One can see that the image of
the  deflected  beam  strongly  reflects  the  character  of  the  surface  scratches.
This  effect  is  explained  by  the  fact  that  the  protons  near  a  scratch  are
channeled by deformed crystal planes. Reconstruction analysis of the angles
of deflected particles shows that deformation of the crystallographic planes
penetrates to substantial depths, down to a few hundred microns as depicted
in Fig. 2(a). Therefore, this effect could be profitably used for creation of a
CU  by  making  a  periodic  series  of  micro  grooves  on  the  crystal  surface  as
shown on Fig. 2(b).

Figure 1. The microphotography of crystal end face with scratches (left) and image of the 70
GeV proton beam deflected by this crystal shown at a distance of 1 m (right).

Presently  a  series  of  undulators  (Silicon  (110)  oriented  wafers)  was
manufactured with the following parameters: the length along the beam from
1  to  5  mm,  thickness  across  the  beam  0.3  to  0.5  mm,  10  periods  of
oscillation with the step from 0.1 to 0.5 mm, and the amplitude on the order
of 20 - 150 Å. The scratching was done in IHEP and Ferrara.

 HIGH-ENERGY CHANNELING TESTS OF CU

 Firstly,  the  undulators  were  tested  and  characterized  with  X-rays  as
described in refs.2,3. The X-ray tests showed that  a  sinusoidal-like  shape  of
crystalline  planes  goes  through  the  bulk  of  the  crystal  with  appropriate
amplitudes. In the proposed method of CU manufacturing, some part of the
crystal  lattice  is  disrupted  by  scratches  and  is  not  suitable  for  channeling,
therefore we tested our crystal undulators directly for channeling of 70 GeV
protons. The tests were  made with our usual technique, carefully  described
in  ref.17.  Four  CU  wafers  of  the  thickness  of  0.3-0.5  mm,  with  about  10
periods, were bent by means of the devices described in ref.17 by the angle of
about  1  mrad  and  installed  in  a  circulating  accelerated  beam  as  shown  in
Fig.3.

This  angle  of  bending  is  sufficient  to  separate  the  circulating  and  the
deflected (by the crystal) beams in space. The beam deflection effect due to
channeling  was  measured  by  secondary  emission  detector,  located  in  the
vacuum chamber of the accelerator near to circulating beam.

Figure  3.  The  scheme  of  extraction  of  a  circulating  high-energy  proton  beam  with  a  bent
undulator-type crystal.

On  Fig.  4(a)  the  profile  of  the  beam  deflected  by  one  of  the  tested
crystals is shown as a function of the orientation of this crystal. The crystal
was  5  mm  along  the  beam  and  0.3  mm  across  and  had  10  periods  of
sinusoidal  deformations  with  a  step  of  0.5  mm  and  the  amplitude  of  about
100 Å. The top left profile corresponds to the disoriented crystal when only a
scattering  tail  of  the  beam  is  seen.  On  the  following  picture  (top  right)  the
crystal  orientation  is  optimal.  In  this  case  the  efficiency  of  extraction  (the
ratio  of  the  fully  deflected  channeled  beam  to  the  total  losses  of  the
circulating  beam)  is  equal  to  31  %.  In  the  same  conditions,  a  usual  bent
crystal (without scratches) of a similar size has extracted about 45 % of the
beam.  Thus  the  measurements  showed  that  all  CU  crystals  deflect  protons
with  good  efficiency  and  at  least  70  %  of  the  crystal  cross-section  is
available  for  channeling  despite  of  the  distortions  caused  by  scratches.
Actually,  part  of  the  overall  reduction  of  30%  should  be  due  to  additional
centrifugal  forces  from  undulation  in  crystal  lattice,  therefore  the  crystal
cross-section available for channeling is significantly larger than 70% of the
total.

Figure 4. Deflected beam profile and the efficiency of extraction versus the crystal orientation
angle.

The presence of periodic deformations with large amplitude in the crystal
lattice, confirmed earlier by X-ray tests, and the experimentally established
transparence of the lattice for channeled high-energy particles allows one to
start  a  direct  experiment  on  photon  production  from  positron  beam  in  a
crystalline undulator.

PHOTON EMISSION EXPERIMENT

The present collaboration has several appropriate sites for an experiment
on  generation  of  photons  in  a  crystalline  undulator.  One  site  is  Laboratori
Nazionali di Frascati with the positron beam energy 500-800 MeV. Another
site  is  IHEP  where  one  can  arrange  positron  beams  with  the  energy  higher
than  2  GeV.  The  new  opportunity  has  occurred  recently  at  CERN  SPS
positron beam line H4 under the proposal  18 at the energy of about 10 GeV
and higher. The progress in LNF is described in ref. 3.

Fig.  5  shows  the  equipment  layout  for  realization  of  experiment  on  the
secondary  beam  line  22  in  IHEP  Protvino.    Crystalline  undulator  is  placed
into  vacuum  box,  inside  which  a  remotely  controlled  goniometer  is
positioned.  The  goniometer  provides  a  horizontal  translation  of  the  crystal
for its exposure into the beam within the limits of about 100 mm, with a step
size  of  0.05  mm.  Also,  it  provides  an  alignment  of  the  crystal  within  ±30
mrad with a step size of about 0.010 mrad.

Right after the vacuum box, a cleaning magnet is positioned. The vacuum
system  is  ended  by  the  tube10  m  long,  200  mm  in  diameter,  which  has  a

Mylar  window  at  the  end,  0.1-0.2  mm  thick.  Small  finger  scintillator
counters,  one  installed  before  the  crystal  and  another  one  12  meters
downstream, select beam particles in a narrow angular interval of about ±0.1
mrad and form a trigger  signal for specrometer of photons. As a detector of
photons, a crystal of NaI (Tl) of ∅1 cm ×10 cm is used. Part of the above
described equipment is seen on photos of Figs.6, 7.

drivers in the setup at IHEP

The comissioning of the set-up with 3 GeV positron beam has shown that
the  main  systems  work  normally  and  background  conditions  on  photon
detector  are  appropriate.  The  first  results  with  necessary  statistics  are
expected  in  the  next  run  of  the  IHEP  accelerator  (planned  near  the  end  of
2004).  The expected spectra of the photons generated in CU are shown in
Fig. 8. Calculations were carried out for the (110) plane of a  silicon  single
crystal  with  realistic  sizes  and  take  into  account  the  following  factors:
channeling  radiation  and  dechanneling  process,  radiation  of  the  above-
barrier positrons, absorption of gamma-quanta in the undulator bulk  3.  The
calculated  number  of  photons  in  the  range  100–600  KeV  is  0.15  per  one
positron channeled through the crystalline undulator. The spectral density of
undulator radiation is 5 times greater than that of usual channeling radiation.
Notice that our prediction (Fig.8, see also ref.3) is quite different from that of
Solov’ev et al (e.g. Fig. 2 in ref. 9) who predict the spectrum to be essentially
zero everywhere but a very narrow undulator peak and a peak of channeling
radiation, in vast contrast with our results.

0–0.7 Mev (b). The dashed curve is the photon spectrum, where absorption process of
photons in the body of undulator is taken into account. The curves are normalized on one
positron passing through the undulator within channeling angle.

CONCLUSION

 Real  crystal  undulator  devices  have  been  created.  The  tests  of  these
devices with X-rays and high-energy channeled protons were performed, and
the  experimental  conditions  necessary  for  observation  of  photon  emission
from  positron  beam  in  crystalline  undulator  were  prepared.  Creation  of  a
new  source  of  radiation  with  high  spectral  density,  superior  to  the  usual
channeling  radiation  is  expected  on  the  basis  of  crystal  undulator.
Crystalline  undulator  would  allow  to  generate  photons  with  the  energy  on
the  order  of  1  MeV  at  the  synchrotron  light  sources  where  one  has  at  the
moment only 10 KeV, and for this reason crystal undulators have interesting
prospects for application.

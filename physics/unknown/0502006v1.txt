Abstract – Most of the logical objections against the classical laws of motion, as they
are  usually  presented  in  textbooks,  centre  on  the  fact  that  defining  force  in  terms  of
mass  and  acceleration,  the  first  two  laws  are  mere  assertions  of  concepts  to  be
introduced in the theory; conversely, the third law expresses the experimental fact that
the ratio of masses is inversely proportional to the ratio of accelerations, but it is known
to  fail  when  the  interacting  bodies  are  rapidly  accelerated  or  far  apart,  leading  to
objections  at  the  research  level,  particularly  when  electromagnetic  phenomena  is
present.  Following  a  specification  of  the  coordinate  system  with  respect  to  which
velocities and accelerations are to be measured, relative to a fixed spacetime point, this
contribution argues that the limitation of the third law is removed; as a consequence,
Energy and Momentum relations are given an alternative formulation, extending their
fundamental  aspects  and  terms  to  the  relativistic  level.  Most  important,  the  presented
alternative  relations  seem  to  preserve  exactly  the  same  form  of  the  concepts  as
originally  used by Newton in the Principia.

The  classical  laws  of  motion  [1,3]  follow  from  the  analysis  of  a  "free–fall"
experiment (isolated bodies) whose result, the ratio of masses inversely proportional to
the ratio of accelerations, can be generalised to include "any" pair of  bodies:

where V refers to a body of mass M and v to a body of mass m , the dot meaning the
usual time differentiation.

Actually, accelerations are the experimental data, so that this should be written

where the subscript "exp" explicitly indicates that the right hand ratio is an experimental
or measured quantity.

Now, instead of a discussion  concerned  with  the  elements  (  force,  momentum,
kinetic energy) that led to the construction of the theory, the emphasis here will be on
the fact that the framework of  classical  mechanics  is  based  on  experimental  data;  this
points to a comprehensive method of acceleration measurements in spacetime.

Spacetime Measurements

According  to  classical  mechanics,  objects  flow  in  spacetime,  in  a  sense  that
coordinates  can  be  specified  as  functions  of  time,  such  as  x  =  x(t);  assuming  the
meaning of  x(t) is known, velocities and accelerations are taken as usual:

v

   ;

However,  from  the  experimental  point  of  view,  if  objects  flow  in  time,  the
experimental values of velocities and accelerations are obtained via time measurements,
so that relations (2) should be written as:

•

In  relations  (2.a)  the  time  derivatives  are  absent  due  to  the  fact  that  they  are
theoretical  functions  whereas  the  D  symbolises  only  experimental  data.  According  to
this  relation,  velocity  measurements  imply  detection  of  two  events  Dt  =  t2  –  t1  taking
place at distinct places, Dx = x2 – x1 , as shown bellow:

                                                   DX
                    x1                                                          x2                                                  X

                 m             v                                               m            v

                   "O"
                                             Dt
                                                                                                                                           t
                     t1                                                            t2

Figure 1  Velocity measurement employing space and time detection. Observer "O" is
                 assumed at ( x1 , t1 ) , the position of the first measurement.

Now, the distance Dx = x2 – x1 can be determined a priori or a posteriori; however, the
temporal  location  must  be  determined  "on  time";  this  states  that  the  time  measured
(Dtexp ) by the observer at t1 is the elapsed time ( Dt = t2 – t1 ) of the two events plus the
time required to transport the event taking place at  ( x2 , t2 ) to ( x1 , t1 ) :

implying that velocity measurements underestimates the real value, so that the classical
assumption  that,  in  principle,  it  is  possible  to  devise  instruments  to  measure  this
quantity  with  as  small  an  error  as  we  please  holds  only  if  the  speed  vi  is  infinity.
Assuming the speed of light in vacuum –  c as a limiting experimental speed, it can be
shown [2] that:

where v , the "true" or theoretical value  of the speed of the object is written in terms of
experimental quantities. Time equation (3) is therefore

The pair of equations (7) and (8) gives a practical way of measuring time, velocities and
consequently accelerations; the last can be obtained by dividing  (7) by (8)

where the left term is the "true" or theoretical value of the acceleration written in terms
of experimental values; please note that vexp is an experimental quantity, so the dot over
it is just representative. Now, this result can be employed to analyse the free-fall .

By noting that Dtint is the rate of change of the two body system –  [ m , M ], it is taken
as a medium value of the "time of flight" of the individual bodies

implying  that  momentum  is  a  "dual"  quantity  representing  the  [  m  ,  M  ]  system;  not
individual  particles.  The  mutual  actions  of  two  bodies  upon  each  other*  produces
momentum.

The  result  resembles  an  impulse-type  force  that  depends  only  on  velocities,
though a spacetime representation can be sketched. In one dimension this is equivalent
to two component equations, which for similar masses (and velocities) reads ( Figure 2):

The symbolic vectors V and v , according to the definitions recorded here, can
also  be  expressed  as  experimental  quantities;  in  this  sense,  the  "Third  Law"  admits  a
distinct interpretation.

The Third Law

The  failure  of  the  third  law  [4]  is  commonly  [1]  associated  to  electromagnetic
phenomena , but in general it fails for any forces which propagate from one particle to
another with finite velocities; this failure can be  associated to the  classical assumption
that  the  behaviour  of  measuring  instruments  is  unaffected  by  their  state  of  motion,
leading  to  the  foundations  of    the  theory  of  relativity.  But  one  can  express  the
momentum result in terms of experimental quantities; in this manner, taking eq. 11 , the
impressed force becomes:

where Fv  refers to body m .

Noting that the impressed force is sensed by body m , this can be rewritten as

Equation (14) gives a way of specifying forces which propagate from one body
to  another  with  finite  velocities;  it  is  an  active  picture  of  the  original  newtonian
formulation  that  incorporates  velocity-dependants  non-Lorentzian  factors  (  the  pre-

7

square root terms); nevertheless, these are active only as  measured velocities approach
the speed of light.

It  is  difficult  to  oppose  the  distinguished  authority  consecrated  by  centuries  of
usage;  however,  specification  of  the  coordinate  system  with  respect  to  which
accelerations  are  to  be  measured  (  relative  measurement  determined  by  the  signal
carrier, figure 1 ) sets the usual interpretation of the third law, action equals reaction, as
a limiting static situation. We now consider energy relations.

Energy

The  concept  of    energy  and  its  qualifying  adjectives  changed  historically  and
also from discipline to discipline [4,5] ; perhaps the less elegant tough more physically
sounded  is  the  (kinetic)  correspondence  to  work.  In  this  sense,  it  is  associated  to  the
spatial rate of change of the impressed force:

These  equations  are  analogous  to  the  conventional  ones  when  the  masses  and
velocities of the interacting bodies are exactly equal; conceptually, the procedure to go
over  from  the  usual  classical  treatment  of  the  motion  to  the  one  recorded  here  is
straightforward: rather than assuming the equality between theoretical and experimental
quantities, such as v and vexp , one considers that the last can be obtained only via a third
element, the informational velocity vi. On the other hand, it was the motivation for the
analysis of experimental data which "generate" the symbolic or theoretical terms, such
as E in eq. (17)

Despite  the  conventional  status  of  Newton's  laws,  assumed  to  hold  only  in  a
limited  range,  particularly  the  third  one,  the  recorded  results  suggest  that  their
fundamental aspects and terms can reach the level of relativistic mechanics, provided a
different scheme of the measurement problem is settled.

varies between ½ and 2 due to the fact that experimental speeds, vexp and Vexp are limited
by  c.  Thus  the  medium  (geometrical)  value  is  1,  corresponding  to  classical  (<<c)
velocities .

2.  Change of motion differs from the common statement rate of change of momentum ,
though the symbolic "P" is used  for the last; note however that eq. (13)  represents
the mutual action of two bodies upon each other, a statement appearing in the third
law [ 3,6].

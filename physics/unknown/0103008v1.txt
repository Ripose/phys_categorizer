Rest mass or inertial mass?

ABSTRACT

Rest mass takes place of inertial mass in modern physics textbooks. It seems to be wrong. This
topic has been considered by the author in the article [1, 2, 3]. Additional arguments to a conﬁrmation
of such a thesis are presented here.

“Einstein’s theory of the universe, based on the
principle that all motion is relative, and showing
that mass varies with its velocity, while space-time
is a fourth dimension.”

P = mv.

1. REST MASS

A. S. Hornby et al. [4]

But mass as a measure of inertia of a body can be deﬁned also by the formula

The end of 20-th century was marked by a great mish-mash of deﬁnitions of mass.

Inertia of a body determines momentum P of the body at given velocity v of the body, i. e. it

to being accelerated” [5].

“mass is the quantity of matter in a body. Mass may also be considered as the equivalent
of inertia, or the resistance oﬀered by a body to change of motion (i. e. acceleration).
Masses are compared by weighting them.” [6].

2. INERTIAL MASS AT HIGH SPEEDS

However, the special theory of relativity has shown that no body can be accelerated up to the
speed of light because the acceleration of a body decreases to zero when the speed of the body
approaches the speed of light, however large the accelerating force is. This implies that inertia of a
body increases to inﬁnity when the speed of the body tends to the speed of light, though the “amount
of substance” of the body obviously remains constant.

More correctly, special relativity has shown that the momentum P of a body at any speed is
parallel to velocity v. Therefore the formula P = mv is valid at large speeds, if the coeﬃcient m,
that is inertial mass, is accepted to be increased with speed in the fashion:

(5)

(6)

where c is the speed of light. That is, the expression

m =

m0
1 − v2/c2

,

P =

m0v
1 − v2/c2

,

q

q

is valid for the momentum of a body.

In these formulae m0 is the value of mass which was spoken about in the beginning. For a
determination of the value, the body should be slowed down and, after it, the formula (1) or (2)
must be applied at small speed. The value received by this method is called rest mass. This mass,
by deﬁnition, does not vary on accelerating a body. Therefore, the formulae (1), (2), (3) must be
written as follow: P = m0v, F = m0a, F = γMm0/r2. However, for small speeds, due to formula
(5), inertial mass is equal to rest mass, m = m0, and consequently the record (1), (2), (3 ) is correct
in the “before special relativity section”.

To emphasize the fact that inertial mass m depends on speed it is named relativistic mass:
it
appears to have diﬀerent values from points of view of various observers if the observers have relative
velocities. Meanwhile, there is a preferred value of inertial mass m0. This value is observed by an
observer which has no velocity relative to the body. Such a property of inertial mass is similar to
the property of time: observers which are in motion relative to a clock measure longer time intervals
then the time interval measured by an observer relative to whom the clock is at rest. This time
interval is called the proper time.

Thus,

“mass is the physical measure of the principal inertial property of a body, i. e., its
resistance to change of motion. At speeds small compared with the speed of light, the
mass of a body is independent of its speed. At higher speeds, the mass of a body depends
on its speed relative to the observer according to the relation:

where m0 is the mass of the body by an observer at rest with respect to the body, v is
the speed of the body relative to the observer who ﬁnds its mass to be m.” [7].

If you wish to check up the formula (6), you should measure velocity v and momentum P of a
body. The momentum of a body is measured by the following operation. A moving body is braked
by a barrier, and during its braking the force F(t) acting on the barrier is measured. The initial
momentum of the body, by deﬁnition, is equal to the integral

P =

F(t)dt.

Z

It is postulated that this integral does not depend on details of braking, that is on a form of function
F(t).

We should notice that the formulas (5) and (6) remain valid for object which has no rest mass,
m0 = 0, for example, for photon or neutrino (if one assumes that rest mass of neutrino is equal to
zero). Such objects have inertial mass and momentum, but they should move with the speed of light.
It is impossible to stop them: they disappear if being stopped. Nevertheless, despite their speed is
constant, their inertial mass appear to be diﬀerent for various observers. However, in the case of
such objects, no preferred value of inertial mass exists. Or, it is possible to say, the preferred value
of inertial mass is equal to zero.

We have detected the increase of inertia of a body at large speed by a reduction of its acceleration
at large speed. Thus we have referred to formula (2). And it is allowable. However, just because of
the increase of inertial mass with the body velocity, the formula (2) can change its form. The point
is that at ﬁxed acceleration, a force directed in parallel with the velocity should supply not only the
increase of speed of available mass

It should also supply an increase of mass:

.

The coeﬃcient

is called “longitudinal mass” [8].

If the force is perpendicular to the velocity and so does not change speed and inertial mass of a

body, the formula F = ma does not change its form:

Using this circumstance, R.Feynman put forward a simple operational deﬁnition of inertial mass
m. “We may measure mass, for example, by swinging an object in a circle at a certain speed and
measuring how much force we need to keep it in the circle.” [9].

When the force has an arbitrary direction, the proportionality factor in formula (2) must be
considered as a certain operator (tensor) which transforms vector a to vector F: F = ˆma. The
operator ˆm depends on speed and a direction of the velocity of a body and, generally speaking,
changes a direction of a vector. It is easy to accept. You see, velocity v is a property of a body, but

a force F acting at the body is an external agent with respect to the body. It is clear that a result
of the inﬂuence of the force, that is an acceleration of a body, can depend on a correlation between
directions of the vectors F and v.

At the same time the general theory of relativity has shown that not only inertia of a body, but

3. GRAVITATIONAL MASS AT HIGHER SPEEDS

also its weight increases with speed by the law (5):

For example, the formula (8) for a body falling downwards with speed v take, roughly speaking, the
form:

I. e. the acceleration due to gravity is

So that inertial mass satisﬁes the principle of equivalence at any speed v of a body.

The exact formula for acceleration can be received within the framework of the general theory of

relativity as is shown in Sec. 8:

g =

γM(1 − v2/c2)
r(r − rg)
r ·

,

q

rg = 2γM/c2.

This formula is a relativistic generalization of the formula (4).

Furthermore, special relativity has shown that an increment of inertial mass, m − m0, multiplied

on square of the speed of light is equal to kinetic energy of a body:

“A result of the theory that mass can be ascribed to kinetic energy is that the eﬀective
mass of the electron should vary with its velocities according to the expression

This has been conﬁrmed experimentally.” [6].

Therefore if we attach a rest energy E0 = m0c2 to a body at rest, the complete energy E = E0+Ek

of a body appears to be proportional to inertial mass:
E = mc2.

This famous Einstein formula proclaims an equivalence between inertial mass and energy. The

two, up to now, diﬀerent concepts are incorporated in a single one.

Thus,

“the formula E = mc2 equates a quantity of mass m to a quantity of energy E. The rela-
tionship was developed from the relativity theory (special), but has been experimentally
conﬁrmed” [7].

We should notice that the formula (12), as well as formulae (5) and (6), are valid for an object

which has no rest mass and rest energy, m0 = 0.

If you wish to check up the formula (11) and simultaneously to make sure that special relativity
is valid, you must measure the inertial mass and the rest mass of a moving body as it was explained
above and, besides this, you must measure kinetic energy of the body:

Ek =

F(l)dl.

Z
Here F(l) is the force acting on the barrier during the body braking and F(l)dl is a scalar product
of the force F and an inﬁnitesimal vector dl of displacement of the barrier. (See [10]).

The formula (11) connects inertial mass, rest mass and kinetic energy. Using formula (6), it is

easy to connect inertial mass, rest mass and momentum:

m2

0 = m2 − P 2/c2.

(13)

For zero rest mass particles we receive:

mc = P,

or E = P c.

5. SYSTEM of BODIES

If several bodies are considered to be a system of bodies, then, as is known, their momenta and

their inertial masses are summed up. For two bodies this take the form:

P = P1 + P2,

m = m1 + m2.

(14)

In other words, momentum and inertial mass are additive.

The case of the rest mass is entirely diﬀerent. Equations (13), (14) imply that rest mass of a pair
of bodies with rest masses m01, m02 is equal not to the sum m01 + m02 but to a complex expression
dependent on the momenta P1, P2:

m0 =

m2

01 + P 2

1 /c2 +

02 + P 2

2 /c2

− (P1 + P2)2/c2.

(cid:19)

Thus, rest mass is, generally speaking, not additive. For example, a pair of photons each having
no rest mass does have a rest mass if the photons move in diﬀerent directions while the pair has no
rest mass if the photons move in the same direction.

Nevertheless, the three quantities, P, m, m0, satisfy the conservation law. That is, they remain

constant with time for a closed system.

However, it seems to be unsuitable to consider rest mass of a system of bodies because of the
nonadditivity of rest mass. It is meaningful to speak only about a sum of rest masses of separate
bodies of system. So, when one speaks that “rest mass of ﬁnal system increases in an inelastic
encounter” [11], the rest mass after the encounter is compared with the sum of rest masses of

5

bodies before the encounter, but not with the system rest mass which is conserved thanks to the
nonadditivity. Just so, when one speaks about the mass defect at nuclear reactions, for example, at
synthesis of deuterium, p + n = D + γ, the sum of the rest masses of proton and neutron is compared
with the sum of the rest masses of deuterium and γ-quantum, but not with the system rest mass
determined by the formula (15).

6. A COMPARISON of MASSES

And here a problem arises. Which of the two masses, the rest mass or the inertial mass, must we
name by a simple word mass, designate by the letter m without indexes, and recognize as a ”main”
mass? It is not a terminological problem. A serious psychologic underlying reason is present here.

To decide which of the masses is the main mass let us repeat once again properties of both masses.
Rest mass is a constant quantity for a given body and denotes “amount of substance of a body”.
It corresponds to a rudimentary Newton belief that the masses stayed constant. But, rest mass
is not equivalent to the energy of a moving object, is not equivalent to gravitational mass, rest
mass is nonadditive and is not used as a characteristic of a system of bodies or particles. This last
circumstance prevents the conservation law displaying. Particles moving with the speed of light have
no rest mass. The operational deﬁnition of rest mass of a particle assumes its deceleration up to a
small speed without use of an information about current condition of the particle.
Its value depends on observer’s velocity.

Inertial mass is
equivalent to energy and to gravitational mass, Inertial mass is additive, it satisﬁes the conservation
law. The operational deﬁnition of inertial mass is based on the simple formula bf P = mv.

Inertial mass is relativistic mass.

From our point of view, inertial mass has to be called mass and to be designate m, as it is done

in the present article.

7. UNDERLYING PSYCHOLOGIC REASON

Unfortunately, plenty of physicists considers the rest mass as a main mass, designates it by m,
instead of m0, and discriminates the inertial mass. These physicists agree, for example, that the
mass of gas which is at rest increases with temperature since its energy increases with temperature.
But, probably, there is a psychologic barrier that prevents them from explaining this increase by an
increase of masses of molecules owing to the increase of their thermal speed.

These physics sacriﬁce the concept of mass as a measure of inertia, sacriﬁce the additivity of
mass and the equivalence of mass and energy to a label attached to a particle with information
about “amount of substance” because the label corresponds the customary Newton belief in invariable
mass. And so they think that a radiation which, according to Einstein [12], “transfers inertia between
emitting and absorbing bodies” has no mass.

Now inertial mass is excluded from textbooks and from popular science literature [11, 13, 14],
but this phenomenon is hidden by the fact that rest mass adherents busily call rest mass mass, not
rest mass, and the word mass is associated with a measure of inertia.

The main psychologic diﬃculty is to identify mass and energy (which varies), to accept these two
essences as one. It is easy to accept the formula E0 = m0c2 for a body at rest. But it is more diﬃcult
to accept a validity of the formula E = mc2 for any speed. The famous Einstein relation between
mass and energy, that is a symbol of 20-th century, seems “ugly” to L. B. Okun’ [15].

Rest mass adherents are not, probably, capable to accept an idea of relativistic mass the same
as early opponents of special relativity could not accept the relativity of time. The lifetime of an
unstable particle varies with velocity as its inertial mass:

τ = τ0/

1 − v2/c2.

It is appropriate to quote here from Max Planck:

“Great new scientiﬁc idea is seldom inculcated on opponents by means of a gradual
persuasion. Saul seldom becomes Paul. As a matter of fact, opponents gradually die out,
and the new generation is accustomed to the new idea from the very beginning.” [16].

Unfortunately, the great idea of relativistic mass is carefully isolated from youth. Now the article [1,
2, 3] is rejected by editors of the following journals: “Russian Physics Journal”, “Kvant” (Moscow),
“American Journal of Physics”, “Physics Education” (Bristol). “Physics Today”.

Here we will arrive at the formula (10) considering Schwarzschild space-time [17] with the interval:

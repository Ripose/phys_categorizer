1. Introduction 
Current  literature shows that surface-wave sustained discharges (SWDs) can advantageously be 
used  as  sources  of  excitation  in  mass  spectrometry  and  atomic  emission  spectrometry  to 
determine  the  composition  of  analytical  samples  [1-2].  In  particular,  SWDs  are  most 
advantageous than Inductively Coupled Plasmas (ICPs) for the excitation of halogens and other 
nonmetals that are not readily accessible to ICP detection with the adequate sensitivity. 
 
In order to improve and optimize the characteristics of SWDs for applications, it is necessary to 
achieve a good understanding of the discharge as a function of the experimental conditions. The 
crucial  parameters  characterizing  the  discharge  and  therefore  influencing  its  analytical 
performances  are  the  electron  density  (ne)  and  temperature  (Te),  as  well  as  the  gas  temperature 
(Tg). Because of their relatively high density, other species such as atoms (n(p)) and ions (n+) are 
also expected to play an important role in the discharge kinetics.  

 

At  atmospheric  pressure,  the  electron  temperature  can  often  be  difficult  to  determine 
experimentally and, for this reason, its value is frequently speculated. Assuming the plasma to be 
in  Local  Thermodynamical  Equilibrium,  the  distribution  of  the  population  of  the  excited  levels 
obeys  a  Saha-Boltzmann  distribution  with  an  excitation  temperature  identical  to  the  electron 
temperature.  In  this  equilibrium  situation,  the  production  and  loss  of  the  electrons  at  a 
microscopic level is controlled by the Saha balance and the population distribution of the excited 
levels  obeys  the  Saha-Boltzmann  distribution.  However,  at  atmospheric  pressure,  molecular 
recombination  channels  may  also  play  an  important role in the plasma kinetics. In such a case, 
equality between excitation and electron temperature is questionable. 
 
Molecular ions principally form via atom-assisted association:

The  present  knowledge  on  the  distribution  of  dissociative  products  and  its  influence  over  the 
plasma excitation kinetics is quite incomplete. In the case of argon, it is usually assumed that the 
most important dissociative recombination channel of dimer ions yields one argon atom in the 4p 
state  and  the  other  one  in  the  ground  state  [3].  However,  it  has  been  recently  found  that

dissociative recombination results in a significant number of excited atoms in the 4s state and a 
non negligible fraction of atoms in the ground state [4-5]. 
 
In the present work we present a few preliminary results from a collisional-radiative (CR) model 
that  we  developed  for  an  argon  microwave  (2.45  GHz)  plasma  at  atmospheric  pressure.  This 
model    aims  to  investigate  the  influence  of  dissociative  recombination  products  on  the  Saha-
Boltzmann  plasma  equilibrium.  The  model  is  tested  through  comparison  with  experimental 
results  obtained  in  an  argon  plasma  column  generated  by  a  traveling  electromagnetic  surface-
wave in a cylindrical tube open to the air [7-9]. In the traveling wave regime, such plasmas are 
characterized by a plasma density and electron temperature that decrease as one moves from the 
wave launcher region (where power flux is maximum) to the end of plasma column (where power 
flux  comes  to  zero).  Therefore,  with  only  one  plasma  column,  it  is  possible  to  perform  a 
parametric investigation of the plasma, which is quite suitable for model testing.

2.2 Conditions for the simulations  
All the simulations were performed using with the following conditions: Tg = 1500 K, P = 760 
Torr,  a  =  0.5  mm  (radius  of  the  tube),  which  correspond  to  the  experimental  observations 
reported  by  Calzada  et  al.  [7],  Garcia  et  al.  [8]  and  Santiago  [9].  The  electron  density  values 
along the plasma column were taken from the work of Calzada et al [7]. 
 
3. Results and discussion  
3.1 Influence of the dissociative recombination products on the excited levels populations 
As  mentioned  earlier,  some  authors  [3,  10-11]  consider  that  the  most  important  products  from 
dissociative recombination yield one argon atom in the ground state (p = 1) and another one in 
the 4p excited level. Other researchers reported that the process should rather yield atoms in the 
4s state and in the ground state [4-5]. These cases correspond to the following reactions

Using our collisional-radiative model, we calculated the excited level populations considering the 
DR  products  given  either  by  Eq.(3)  or  by  (4).  The  results  were  compared  to  the  populations 
experimentally  determined.  Figure  1  shows  that  the  reaction  products  are  crucial  for  the

populations  of  excited  levels.  Actually,  a  better  agreement  between  theory  and  experiment  is 
achieved  when  considering  Eq.  (3)  rather  and  Eq.  (4).  This  indicates  that  DR  produces  a  large 
number of argon atoms in 4s state.

Figure  1:  Population  density  of  excited  atoms  calculated  assuming  that  one  of  the 
dissociative recombination products is the 4s state (triangles) and the 4p state (squares). 
The calculations were performed for Tg=1500 K, Te=5600 K and ne=4 ·
 1014 cm-3. The 
results are compared with available experimental data. 

In order to estimate the weight of each possible product resulting from DR, we have performed 
calculations by considering that the reaction could produce argon atoms in ground state as well as 
in the 4s, 3d, 4p and 5p states with fractions c (1), c (4s), c (3d), c (4p) and c (5p), respectively. The 
equation system was closed by specifying two conditions: 1) the sum of the c
 fractions is equal to 
unity,  and  2)  c (3d)/c (4p)  »
  0.7  as  stated  in  reference  [12].  It  was  thus  found  that  the  best  fit 
between model and experiments occurs for c (1) = 0.25, c (4s) = 0.70, c (4p) = 0.02, c (3d) = 0.02, 
while  c (5p)  is  negligible.  Thus,  it  appears  that  dissociative  recombination  predominantly 
populates the 4s levels and the ground state, in agreement with the experimental results obtained 
by Ramos et al. [4-5].

3.2. Influence of Ar2
In order to quantitatively determine the departure from local Saha Equilibrium, we calculated the 
b(p)= n(p) n (p) , where n(p) and ns(p) denote the population density of atoms in the 
parameter 
level  p  and  the  corresponding  Saha  population  and  p  is  the  effective  quantum  number 
, where ζ is the core charge of the atom, EH the hydrogen ionization potential, 
(
p
and Eip  the ionization potential of the atom in the level p). Those levels for which b = 1 are in 
Local Saha Equilibrium. 
 
Figures  2a  and  2b  compare  the  calculated  b(p)  values  to  those  measured  experimentally  for 
different z positions along the plasma column, i.e. various (ne, Tg) sets. Calculations were carried 
out  for  two  situations:  one  considering  dissociative  recombination    and  another  one  where  it  is 
neglected. It is observed from Fig. 2a and 2b that DR strongly influences the population of the 
levels, specially those of lower energy (p < 3). Actually, considering DR reduces departure from 
equilibrium. It can also be seen that the experimental data obtained by Calzada et al. [6] fall close 
to the theoretical results obtained with DR.  Figures 3a and 3b further show that b(p) increases 

-3- 

 4 at low plasma density (z = 2 cm) and for p ~

with p until it reaches unity. This occurs for p ~
 2 
at  higher  density  (z  =  8  cm).  In  this  later  case,  almost  all  levels  are  in  equilibrium  except  the 
group of the 4s levels. Thus the plasma is closer to equilibrium as ne increases, which is no real 
surprise since LTE is more likely to occur in denser plasmas. In all cases, the higher levels (close 
to  the  ionization  limit)  appear  to  be  in  equilibrium.  This  allows  assuming  that  the  excitation 
temperature Texc determined from the upper levels in the atomic system in the Boltzmann-plot is 
equal to Te.

From  Figs.  2a  and  2b,  the  plasma  clearly  presents  a  recombining  behavior  since  b(p)  is  almost 
everywhere  smaller  than  1.  As  just  mentioned  the  4s  levels  are  those  that  show  the  most 
significant departure from equilibrium. It is particularly striking for the 3P2 metastable population 
as illustrated in Fig. 3.  This figure shows the calculated values of b(p) for the 3P2 level using as 
input  parameters  to  the  model  those  experimentally  observed  at  various  axial  positions  along  a 
surface-wave  plasma  column.  For comparison, the experimental  data  obtained by Santiago [12] 
using a self-absorption method are also shown.

Figure  3:  Departure  from  local  Saha  equilibrium  for  the  3P2  metastable  population. 
The  calculations  were  performed  for  input  parameters  (ne  and  Te)  that  correspond  to 
various positions z along a surface-wave plasma column. 

As  can  be  seen,  both  model  and  experiment  show  that  for  this  level,  the  discharge  exhibits  a 
recombining-to-ionizing transition as electron density increases, i.e, when moving from the end 
of plasma column (smaller z values) to larger z positions. Despite the small discrepancy between 

-4-

theory  and  experiment  on  the  z  position  at  which  transition  occurs,  it  is  clear  that  that  the 
discharge  is  characterized  by  two  zones  with  different  internal  kinetics.  The  first  one  (higher  z 
values) corresponds to higher electron density. Ions and electrons are continuously created, likely 
from the metastable levels, and creation is balanced by recombination that maintains the ne value 
constant  under  steady-state  conditions.  In  the  second  zone  (lower  z  values,  i.e.  lower  electron 
density values), the 4s and 4p levels are underpopulated with respect to the corresponding Saha-
Boltzmann  populations  because  of  the  gradual  loss  of  energy  by  the  surface  wave  that  favors 
recombination.

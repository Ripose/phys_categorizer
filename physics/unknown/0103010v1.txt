Cauchy stress in mass distributions

The thermodynamic definition of pressure P = ∂U/∂V is one form of the principle that in a given state, the mass in V and 
potential  are  proportional.  Subject  of  this  communication  is  the  significance  of  this  principle  for  the  understanding  of 
Cauchy stress.  
 
The stress theory as it is used today, was developed by Euler in 1776 and Cauchy in 1823. The following is a slightly edited 
quote of Truesdell [1].

 (1) 
 
p.170: Cauchy assumed that the tractions t on all like-oriented contacts with a common plane at x are the same at x, i.e. 
tS  at  x  is  assumed  to  depend  on  S  only  through  the  normal  n  of  S  at  x:  tS = t (x, n).  This  statement  is  called  the  Cauchy 
postulate. S is oriented so that its normal n points out of c(B) if S is a part of ∂c(B). Thus t (x, -n) is the traction at x on all 
surfaces S tangent to ∂c(B) and forming parts of the boundaries of bodies in the exterior c(Be) of c(B). In this sense t (x, n) is 
the traction exerted upon B at x by the contiguous bodies outside it. As a trivial corollary of (1) follows Cauchy·s fundamental 
lemma: t (x, -n) = -t (x, n).  
p.176: v1 and v2 are linearly independent. At a given place x0 the planes P1 and P2 normal to v1 and v2, respectively, are 
 
distinct. We set v3 = -(v1 + v2) and consider the wedge A that is bounded by these two planes and the plane P3 normal to v3 at 
the place x0 + εv3. We suppose ε small enough that A be the shape of some part of B, and we denote by ∂iA the portion of the 
plane Pi that makes a part of the boundary of A. We let ε approach 0. If we write Ai for the area of ∂iA, we see that

On the other hand, we see that c → 0 as ε → 0. Therefore, since the sum in (5) is independent of ε, it must vanish:

The key argument in the above text is: (cid:147)since the sum in (5) is independent of ε(cid:148). It is an a priori condition; behind this 
 
is  the  assumption  that  Newton(cid:146)s  3rd  law  (1)  is  the  proper  equilibrium  condition  for  the  problem,  and  the  Newtonian 
understanding of pressure, P = |f|/A which is believed to be universally scale-independent. Pressure is a state function, and a 
pressure increase requires that work is done on a system of mass distributed in V; it is a change of state in the sense of the 
First Law. Pressure is defined as energy density, 
 
The question is then: how are P = |f|/A and P = ∂U/∂V mathematically related?  

P   =   ∂U/∂V.

The  thermodynamic  definition  of  P  is  scale-independent,  and  an  explicit  statement  of  the  proportionality  of  mass 
 
(measured  in  V  the  radius  of  which  is  r  =  |r|)  and  potential  U  in  a  given  state  (Kellogg  [2:80]).  The  thermodynamic 
equilibrium condition is  
 
Psurr (cid:150) Psyst =  0 
 
(8) 
in scalar form. If both terms are thought to be caused by forces f [Newton] acting from either side on the surface of the system 
V the equilibrium condition is 
 
fsurr (cid:150) fsyst   =   0; 
(9) 
for  isotropic  conditions  (subsequently  implied),  both  f  are  radial  force  fields.  Since  the  system  contains  mass,  and  since  it 
interacts with the surrounding through exchange of work, it acts as a source of forces; i.e. its source density 
 in some 
statically loaded state.  ϕ  is always proportional to the mass in the system (Kellogg [2:45]); an existence theorem requires that 
if there is some function f of a point Q such that

both LHS and RHS must vanish with the maximum chord of V (Kellogg [2:147]). As with all of thermodynamics (Born [3]), 
the approach to stress must thus be based on a Poisson equation (Kellogg [2:156]). The equilibrium condition (8) thus can 
take the form  
 

syst
It is therefore of interest how the volume functions relate to the surface functions if the domain of interest V is changed 

 
in scale. In 
(cid:1)
 
 
(12) 
f  may  be  either  one  of  the  LHS  terms  in  (9).  If  mass  is  continuously  distributed,  ϕ   ∝  V,  and  ∇ ⋅ f  is  a  constant  that  is 
characteristic of the energetic state in which the system is. Hence in (12), LHS ∝ V. Since V ∝ r3, but A ∝ r2, for LHS ∝ r3 to 
hold it follows that |f| ∝ r, or

Thus as V → 0, |f|/A → ∞, yet ∆U/∆V → const. Both fsyst and fsurr vanish with r; the condition in (10) is observed, stating that 
a system V with zero magnitude cannot do work on its surrounding, and vice versa.  
ε (2-5) is an one-dimensional measure of the magnitude of the prism A (2), as is r for V in the subsequent discussion. It 
 
is to be taken into account that P = |f|/A is scale-independent if A is a free plane, yet both the surface of the prism A in (2) and 
the  surface  A  in  (12)  are  closed  surfaces.  The  difference  between  (1)  and  (9)  is  that  the  latter  distinguishes  system  and 
surrounding  whereas  the  former  does  not.  The  thermodynamic  system  V  represents  a  distributed  source  in  the  sense  of 
potential  theory  (Kellogg  [2:150 ff]).  ε  or  r,  respectively,  is  the  zero  potential  distance  (Kellogg  [2:63])  which  may  have 
infinite length, or if it is finite it is set to have unit length by convention, but it cannot be zero or otherwise be let vanish.

Abstract

A telescope specifically designed for the observation of the stellar aberration of light is proposed.
It is distinctive in two main features: a lengthy collimated beam and an adjustable position of the
photo-detector along the telescope axis, so the beam length-of-flight can be varied from zero to
the  telescope  total  length.  This  is  achieved  by  means  of  a  telecentric  objective  projecting  the
collimated  beam  up  to  a  movable  CCD  camera.  The  spot  position  on  a  high-resolution  photo-
detector  array  is  recorded,  and  the  data  are  transferred  to  a  computer  and  treated  by  a  beam
analyser  software.  The  telescope  aims  to  measure  with  high  accuracy  the  aberration  of  stellar
light  due  to  the  earth  orbital  motion.  An  alternative  would  consist  of  fixing  the  telecentric
objective at the top of a cliff by means of an anti-vibration clamp with a high-precision directional
mount. The detector would be fixed on a micrometric positioner, placed on the foot of the cliff at
the beam position of fall. This way, the beam time-of-flight can be considerably increased, and
hence the subsequent spot shift. For a beam length of 300 m the resulting shift would be of 30
mm, and so in a year the spot would describe a circle of 60 mm diameter. Optionally, a diode
laser may be fixed at the centre of the telescope objective in order to contrast the behaviour of
local and stellar light.

Let  us  at  first  briefly  acquaint  the  Bradley  effect.  The  aberration  of  stellar  light  was  first
interpreted by Bradley in 1726 (1). He observed that the position of stars traces out yearly small
ellipses and he related this effect to the earth speed around the sun. Since all ellipses from stars
in a close direction had the same size they thus could not be due to the parallax effect, which
would  imply  all  stars  to  be  equally  distant  from  the  earth.  Furthermore,  at  two  positions  of  the
earth,  six  months  apart,  the  speed  vectors  have  opposite  directions  and  consequently  the  two
ensuing  aberration  angles  are  opposite.  From  these  facts  Bradley  concluded  that  the  effect
observed was due to the aberration of light uniquely induced by the observer motion. It can be
simply stated as:

I. Introduction

tn ϕ = v / c

Stellar aberration has been proved to be independent of the source speed and to have just a local
origin exclusively based on the earth orbital speed, being of 30 km/s relative to the sun (2-9). The
corresponding  aberration  angle  ϕ  is  equal  to  20.5  arc-s,  value  called  the  constant  of  stellar
aberration.

II. a. Specificity of the telescope

This telescope differs from standard telescopes in that its finality is not to enlarge the image of
stars  but  at  the  contrary  to  reduce  it  to  a  point  on  the  array  detector  and  to  track  any
displacement  of  its  position  on  it.  Optically  it  differs  in  that  its  objective  is  telecentric  (10),  so
incident  stellar  light  rays  are  not  straightforwardly  focused  but  stay  parallel  and  emerge  as  a
narrower  collimated  beam.  The  ensuing  advantage  consists  in  allowing  to  position  the  ocular
lens at any desired distance from the objective and hence to elect at will the beam time-of-flight
within the telescope. The punctual image of the star is collected by means of a high resolution
CCD camera. The spot temporal position on the array detector is transferred to a computer and
analysed by a beam profiler software (11).

Since the camera is mobile all along the beam path up to the objective the beam time-of-flight
can  be  varied  from  zero  to  a  maximum  value  to  and  so  the  beam-spot  shift  ∆x  caused  by  the
concurrent drift of the conveying inertial system varies from zero to a  maximum  value  fixed  by
the telescope length. The spot shift is proportional to the speed of the inertial system and to the
beam  time-of-flight  from  the  objective  to  the  photo-detector.  So,  for  a  given  inertial  speed  the
longer the distance objective-detector the larger the spot shift.

II. b. Measure of stellar aberration

For a beam path of 3 m length (d) and the earth speed (v) around the sun being of about 30 km
(its  average  speed  is  29.79  km),  the  stellar  spot  will  describe  in  a  year  a  circle  with  radius  of
about 300 microns. In effect, the time (t) that light lasts (time-of-flight) to cover 3 m is:

t = d / c = 3 / 3 * 108 = 10-8 s

The aberration shift (∆x), induced by the meanwhile earth lateral drift is:

∆x = v * t = (3*104)*10-8 = 3*10-4 m = 300 µm

However, this shift is not straightforwardly observable since there is no referential origin. So, it
requires  a  long  time  to  become  discernible,  i.e.  until  the  trace  of  the  beam  spot  on  the  array
detector gets extended enough as to allow outlining a sector of the circle it describes in a year
and so to extract its radius. A time of about 3 months may be necessary to get a reliable value.

Since  the  telecentric  objective  allows  lengthening  the  beam  path  at  will  an  alternative  would
consist  of  fixing  it  e.g.  at  the  top  of  a  disused  chimney  or  at  the  terrace  border  of  a  sturdy
building free of local vibrations and the detector at a distant underneath window. Still better, the
telecentric objective could be fixed at the top of a cliff through a high precision adjustable clamp.
The detector would be mounted on micrometric positioner, placed at the bottom of the cliff, right
at the beam position of fall. This way, the beam time-of-flight can be considerably increased, and
hence the subsequent  spot shift.  For  a  beam  length  of  300  m  the  resulting  shift  would  be  100
times 300 µm, i.e. 30 mm. So, in a year the spot would describe a circle of 60 mm diameter.

A pointing diode laser may be added to the telescope, fixed at the  centre  of  its objective  lens,
allowing an extra assessment of the Bradley effect. The spot from the star and the laser are at
first adjusted so that they superpose. After while the time dependence of the position on the array
detector of the spot from the star and from the laser is simultaneously tracked. In the course of one
year the apparent position of the star will describe a quasi-circular ellipse, but since no aberration
has been  detected  from any local source the spot  from the laser beam placed  on  the  telescope
objective will remain still on the array-detector at its initial position (7).

III. Conclusion

The essential advantage of the telescope proposed resides in that it allows an enhanced gauging of
Bradley aberration and thus of the earth orbital speed, through its lengthy collimated beam. Also, it
is adequate for hobbyists since relatively easy to assemble and so to observe the yearly Bradley
aberration of light.

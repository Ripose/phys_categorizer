Abstract  

               The  Brønsted  and  Lowry  acid-base  theory  is  based  on  the  capacity  of  proton 

donation  or  acceptance  (in  the  presence/absence  of  a  solvent)  whereas  the  Lewis  acid-

base  theory  is  based  on  the  propensity  of  electron  pair  acceptance  or  donation.  We 

explore through DFT calculation the obvious question whether these two theories are in 

conformity  with  each  other.  We  use  pKa  as  the  descriptor  for  the  Brønsted  and  Lowry 

acidity. The DFT descriptors like ionization potential, electron affinity, electronegativity, 

hardness and global electrophilicity are computed for 58 organic and inorganic acids. The 

fractional electron transfer, ΔN and the associated energy change, ΔE for the reaction of 

these acids with trimethyl amine (a strong base) are used as the possible descriptors for 

the  Lewis  acidity.  A  near  exponential  decrease  in  ΔN  and  (–ΔE)  values  is  observed  in 

general with an increase in pKa values. The findings reveal that a stronger Brønsted acid 

in most cases behaves as a stronger Lewis acid as well. However it is not necessarily true 

for all acids.

Introduction 

                 Brønsted and Lowry1 suggested that any substance that acts as a proton donor 

should  be  classified  as  an  acid  and  any  substance  that  accepts  a  proton  should  be 

classified as a base. Substances that act in this way are called Brønsted acids and bases, 

respectively.  The  definitions  make  no  reference  to  the  environment  in  which  proton 

transfer occurs, so they apply to proton transfer behavior in any solvent, and even in no 

solvent at all. However, by far the most important medium has been considered to be an 

aqueous  solution and  the  attention  is  confined to that only. On the other hand,  a  Lewis 

acid1 is a substance that acts as an electron pair acceptor. A Lewis base is a substance that 

acts as an electron pair donor. According to Brønsted and Lowry, a stronger acid has a 

smaller pKa value whereas a stronger Lewis acid has a stronger capability to accept a pair 

of  electrons.  Therefore,  the  ionization  potential,  electron  affinity,  electronegativity  and 

electrophilicity  may  be  considered  to  be  measures  of  the  strength  of  a  Lewis  acid.  An 

acid  with  a  lower  pKa  value  is  expected  to  have  a  higher  electron  affinity, 

electronegativity  and  electrophilicity  compared to  other  acids  of  similar  type  if  the  two 

theories need to correlate. 

             Density functional theory2-5 based descriptors may be useful in the prediction of 

Lewis  acidity  and  basicity  of  molecules.  Ionization  potential  (I),  electron  affinity  (A), 

electronegativity  (χ),  chemical  hardness  (η)  and  chemical  potential  (μ)  are  termed  as 

global  reactivity  descriptors.  Parr  et  al.6  have  defined  a  new  descriptor  to  quantify  the 

global electrophilic  power of the molecule as  electrophilicity index (ω), which provides 

a  quantitative  classification  of  the  global  electrophilic  nature  of  a  molecule  within  a 

 

2

relative  scale.    None  of  these  parameters  can  singly  describe  Lewis  acidity  or  basicity. 

Therefore, a different parameter is necessary to describe that.           

                    The  interaction  process  between  an  acid  and  a  base  is  dissected  into  two 

steps : a charge transfer  process resulting in a common chemical potential describing the 

strengths of the acid and the base, at a fixed external potential followed by a reshuffling 

process at a fixed chemical potential.7 The fractional number of electron transfer, ΔN and 

the associated energy change, ΔE in the charge transfer depend on the interplay between 

electronegativity  and  hardness  of  the  acid  and  the  base8-10  which  are  dependent  on 

previously mentioned DFT descriptors. The difference in electronegativity drives electron 

transfer  and  the  sum  of  the  hardness  parameters  acts  as  a  resistance.11  An  ab-initio 

solvation model study is performed in the recent past12 to predict the pKa values of a few 

carbenes.       

                      In  the  present  study  we  compute  electronegativity  (χ),  chemical  hardness 

(η),  chemical  potential  (μ)  and  global  electrophilicity  (ω)  for  a  series  of  58  molecules 

(Table  1).  We  also  compute  the  fractional  number  of  electrons  transferred  (ΔN)  and 

energy change (ΔE) for the reaction of these acids with trimethyl amine, known to be a 

strong base, from these parameters. These two parameters are employed as descriptors of 

Lewis  acidity  and  basicity.  The  correlation  of  ΔN  and  ΔE  with  the  pKa  values  of  acids 

and bases are studied here for the first time.

where  (α  =  +,  -  and  0)  represents  local  philic  quantities  describing  nucleophilic, 

electrophilic  and  radical  attacks.  Eq.  (10)  predicts  that  the  most  electrophilic  site  in  a 

molecule is the one providing the maximum value of ωk

The group concept of philicity is very useful in unraveling reactivity of various 
molecular systems.16 The condensed philicity summed over a group of relevant atoms is 

defined as the “group philicity”. It can be expressed as

α is the group philicity obtained by  adding the local 

philicities  of  the  nearby  bonded  atoms,  where  (α=  +,  -,  0)  represents  nucleophilic,

Computational Details  

                      The geometries of the selected series of all the 58 molecules are optimized  

at  the  B3LYP/6-31G(d)  level  of  theory  using  Gaussian  03  package.17  The  ionization 

potential,  electron  affinity,  electronegativity,  hardness,  chemical  potential  and  global 

electrophilicity  index  are computed employing  the Koopmans’  theorem14 as well as the 

∆SCF method.  The fractional number of the electrons transferred (ΔN) and the energy 

change (ΔE) for the reaction of these acids with trimethyl amine are computed using Eqs. 

(7) and (8) respectively. E(N-1) and  E(N+1) are computed by single point calculations 

for (N-1) and (N+1)-electronic systems with the  same  molecular  geometry  obtained  for 

the  N-electronic  system.  Similar  study  is  performed  both  in  gas  phase  and  in  aqueous 

phase (at 2980K) employing the SCF energies of (N-1), N and (N+1) electronic systems. 

To  study  the  solvent  effects  (in  water  medium),  molecules  are  optimized  in  the 

framework  of  a  self  consistent  reaction  field  polarized  continuum  model  (PCM),  using 

the  B3LYP/6-31G(d)  method.  Fukui  functions  are  calculated  with  the  Mulliken 

population  analysis18  (MPA)  and  Hirshfeld  population  analysis19  (HPA)  scheme 

employing the BLYP/DND method using DMOL3 package.20

Results and Discussion  

                  Table 1 lists the experimental pKa values,21-25 computed electronegativity (χ) 

and  hardness  (η)  of  58  acids  (both  inorganic  and  organic).  The  table  also  contains  the 

fractional number of electrons transferred, ΔN and energy change, ΔE when these acids 

react  with  trimethyl  amine.  Figure  1  presents  the  variation  of  experimental  pKa  values 

with  the  negative  of  the  energy  change  associated  with  the  electron  transfer  from 

trimethyl amine to a host of organic and inorganic acids in gas phase. A near exponential 

decay is easily discernible. A larger (-∆E) value implies a stronger Lewis acid and that 

corresponds to a smaller pKa value implying a stronger Brønsted acid. It may, however, 

be noted that an arbitrary pair  of  acids  may  not  necessarily obey this behaviour. On an 

average  a  stronger  Lewis  acid  is  also  a  stronger  Brønsted  acid.  The  regression  model 

(exponential decay) to predict pKa values using (–∆E) is as follows: 

Pred. pKa = 1.08(0.76) + 23.25(2.66)× EXP[∆E/0.04(0.01)]  

(12)  

R2 = 0.749 ; N = 58 

A reasonably good correlation between the experimental pKa value and the calculated pKa 

value (Table 1) is obtained. Also, corresponding regression model for the solution phase 

is as follows: 

Pred. pKa = 1.41(0.72) + 27.84(3.98)× EXP[∆E/0.04(0.01)]  

(13) 

             

                    

 

R2 = 0.730 ; N = 58 

The  qualitative  trend  does  not  change  in  the  aqueous  solution  (Figure  2)  and/or  using 

Koopmans’ theorem (not shown here). Figures 3 and 4 respectively depict the behavior of 

pKa with ∆N in gas and solution phases respectively. The regression models (exponential 

 

 

 

7

decay) to calculate pKa as a function of ∆N in both the gas and the aqueous phases are 

given as: 

     Gas Phase:   Pred. pKa = -1.26(1.73) + 38.11(6.55)× EXP[–∆N/0.04(0.01)]  

                                

R2 = 0.721 ; N = 58 

 (14) 

     Solution Phase: Pred. pKa = 0.92(0.85) + 82.95(24.90)× EXP[–∆N/0.03(0.01)] 

                                

R2 = 0.757 ; N = 58 

(15) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  exists  an  approximate  exponential  behavior  between  pKa  and  ∆N  implying  the 

congruence  of  the  Brønsted  and  Lewis  definitions  of  acidity  and  basicity  in  an  average 

sense. A larger value of ∆N indicates a greater amount of electron transfer and hence a 

better  Lewis  acid-base  pair.  Since  the  base  remains  same  for  all  the  acid-base  pairs 

studied here and it is a very strong base, a larger ∆N would imply a stronger acid and in 

case it corresponds to a smaller pKa value (stronger Brønsted acid) these two definitions 

would not contradict. It is heartening to note that on an average this is true. An arbitrary 

pair of acids may not always follow a larger ∆N – smaller pKa dictum. However, an acid 

with  a  small  pKa  and  a  small  ∆N,  implying  that  the  Brønsted-Lowry  and  Lewis 

definitions  of  acids  are  at  variance  with  each  other,  is  not  common.  It  is  important  to 

mention that this paper is not meant for sophisticated pKa calculation rather the inherent 

similarity/dissimilarity between the two definitions is analyzed here. 

 

The present work highlights the correlation between pKa and ∆N (–∆E) which are 

global quantities. However, the acidic behavior is expected to be essentially governed by 

the  functional  group  (–COOH,  –OH  etc)  present  in  it.  Accordingly  the  group  philicity 

(

gω+ ) has been considered25 to be a descriptor for pKa prediction. In the present work we 

follow a global-local approach for the molecules containing functional groups (–COOH, 

 

8

–OH), e.g. carboxylic acids and alcohols. While the global be havior is governed by ∆N 

(–∆E), the local aspect is taken care of by 

gω+ . Two different series (carboxylic acids and 

alcohols) are considered for this purpose. Table 2 presents the pKa values estimated with 

the two parameter linear regression model in terms of ∆N (–∆E) and 

gω+  (both MPA and 

HPA). A high degree of correlation is observed (Figures 5 and 6) between the calculated 

and estimated pKa values with coefficient of correlation (R2), variance adjusted to degrees 

of freedom (

2

ADJR

) and variance of leave-one-out cross-validation (

2

CVR ) greater than 0.98 

in  all  cases.  The  carboxylic  acids  and  the  alcohols  fall  on  the  same  line  (slope  close  to 

unity  and  intercept  close  to  zero).  However,  they  fall  on  different  regions  of  the  line 

helping us to identify the different sets of functional groups. The trend is similar for MPA 

and  HPA  calculations.  A  possible  correlation  of  these  descriptors  with  the  cation 

releasing/  anion  accepting  power  of  acids  will  allow  us  to  develop  a  generalized  acid-

base theory encompassing redox and electrophile-nucleophile reactions as well. 

 

 

 

Conclusions 

The  Brønsted-Lowry  and  Lewis  definitions  of  acids  and  bases  are  in  general 

compatible  to  each  other  in  the  sense  that  a  strong  Brønsted  acid  is  generally  a  strong 

Lewis acid as well. However, for an arbitrary pair of acids, a stronger Brønsted acid need 

not  necessarily  be  a  stronger  Lewis  acid.  The  fractional  number  of  electron  transfer 

between an acid and a base and the energy lowering associated with that process may be 

considered  to  be  reasonable  indicators  of  the  corresponding  pKa  values.  The  situation 

improves when the local information in terms of the group philicity is also injected into 

this regression analysis.

Abstract

Using high–sensitivity radon (222Rn) portable detectors,

the

airborne

222Rn

concentration in the interior of various Cypriot buildings and dwellings was measured.

For each preselected building and dwelling, a calibrated detector was put into a closed

room, and the 222Rn concentration was registered in sampling intervals of 2 to 4 hours for

a total counting time of typically 48 hours. 222Rn activity concentrations were found to be

in the range of 6.2 to 102.8 Bq m−3, with an overall arithmetic mean value of (19.3 ± 1.6)

Bq m−3. This value is by a factor of two below the world average (population-weighted)

1. Introduction

222Rn is a radioactive gas released during the decay of the Uranium–238 (238U) natural

series, found in varying amounts in rocks and soils. 222Rn is odourless, invisible, and

without taste, therefore cannot be detected with the human senses.

222Rn decays into radioactive elements, two of which, Polonium–218 (218Po) and

Polonium–214 (214Po) emit alpha particles, which are highly effective in damaging lung

tissues. These alpha–emitting 222Rn decay products have been implicated in a causal

relationship with lung cancer in humans. So, breathing high concentrations of 222Rn can

cause lung cancer.

Outdoors, where it is diluted to low concentrations in the air, 222Rn poses significantly

less risk than indoors. In the indoor environment, however, 222Rn can accumulate to

significant levels. The magnitude of 222Rn concentration indoors depends primarily on the

construction of the building and the amount of 222Rn in the underlying soil. The soil

composition under and around a house affects 222Rn levels and the ease with which 222Rn

migrates into a house. Normal pressure differences between the house and the soil can

2

create a slight vacuum in the house that can draw 222Rn gas from the soil into the

building. 222Rn moves more rapidly through permeable soils, such as coarse sand and

gravel, than through impermeable soils, such as clays. Fractures in any soil or rock allow

222Rn to move more quickly. In a very small number of houses, drinking water can also

be a significant source of 222Rn.

222Rn gas can enter the house from the soil through cracks in concrete floors and walls,

floor drains, sump pumps, construction joints, and tiny cracks or pores in hollow–block

walls. 222Rn levels are generally highest in basements and ground floor rooms that are in

contact with the soil. Factors such as the design, construction, and ventilation of the

house affect the pathways and sources that can draw 222Rn indoors. Another source of

222Rn indoors may be the air released by well water during showering and other

household activities. Compared to 222Rn entering the house through soil, 222Rn entering

the house through water will in most cases be a small source of risk.

The higher the uranium level in an area is, the greater the chances are that houses in the

area will have high levels of indoor 222Rn. But some houses in areas with lots of uranium

in the soil have low levels of indoor 222Rn, and other houses on uranium–poor soils have

high levels of indoor 222Rn. Clearly, the amount of 222Rn in a house is affected by other

factors in addition to the presence of uranium in the underlying soil.

From a geological point of view, there should be little radiation threat from 222Rn in

Cypriot buildings and dwellings. The only rock formation that contains significantly

elevated levels of uranium in Cyprus is the Plagiogranites of the Troodos mountain

Ophiolite (Mukasa and Ludden, 1987).

3

The Troodos ophiolite consists of basic and ultrabasic pillow lavas, fringed by avdesitic

sheeted dykes. The central part consists of basic and ultrabasic plutonic rocks (gabbros,

peridotites, dunites and serpentinized harzburgites).

The highly tectonised and fractured conditions of the Troodos mass, a consequence of

its uplift, facilitated deep weathering of the rocks, leading to the development of a

smooth, mature topography, mantled with a thick cover of a diversity of soils (Robinson

and Malpas, 1998). These soils combined with a variety of microclimates produce

extensive and renewable forests and a great diversity in the flora. The soil cover of the

central area is highly alkaline and provides for very special habitats for certain plants

species. The soils on the slopes, lower down, cover sheeted diabase and are neutral. The

weathering of the sedimentary rocks (chalks, marls, etc.) in the foothills that fringe

Troodos, gave rise to alkaline, calcium rich soils.

Another factor that may increase indoor 222Rn concentrations in buildings and

dwellings in Cyprus is that the Troodos Ophiolite has a large number of deep geological

faults. The depth provides a very large surface area over which 222Rn may emanate

(Christofides and Christodoulides, 1993). The cross–sectional area along the length of the

faults is much less than the surface area, thus enhancing the concentration of 222Rn

reaching the surface. Many villages are built on top of such faults.

A typical Cypriot house contains strengthened reinforced concrete frame, walls made

from bricks, roof from concrete and tiles above the reinforced concrete floor. The walls

are covered by plaster. The doors are mainly wooden and the windows are mainly made

of glass with exterior cover from the sun. Also, the climatic conditions that prevail in

Cyprus allow buildings to be ventilated for long time period, even during the winter. So,

4

the ventilation rate is very high and, therefore, one expects low 222Rn concentration in the

interior of buildings and dwellings. This has been indeed shown by the first indoor radon

measurements in Cypriot homes, which have been carried out eleven years ago

(Christofides and Christodoulides, 1993).

A pilot project was recently initiated by the Nuclear Physics Laboratory of the

Department of Physics, University of Cyprus, with the objective to systematically register

the indoor 222Rn concentration in Cypriot buildings and dwellings. Other part of the

project includes measurement of the terrestrial gamma radiation (Tzortzis et al., 2002) as

well as the detection of alpha–emitting radioisotopes by utilizing radioanalytic techniques

and high–resolution alpha–spectroscopy. In this paper,

the first results from 222Rn

concentration measurements and estimated effective dose rates to the Cyprus population

are presented. The present work refers only to the Government Controlled Area, which

excludes the part of the island under occupation by Turkish invasion forces since July

1974.

2. Experimental technique

2.1. Radon detection system – RADIM3

For

radon concentration measurements, high-sensitivity modern portable detectors

provided with the commercial name “RADIM3” were employed. The Radim3 is a

compact

and dedicated detector

system, designed to directly monitor

222Rn

concentrations, to determine the 222Rn entry rate and ventilation coefficient (Plch, 2001).

The instrument is shown schematically in Fig.1. It incorporates in addition sensors to

simultaneously measure the pressure, the temperature and the humidity. Calibration over

5

the whole dynamical range of the instrument is made by the manufacturer (usually by

relation to a reference Radim3 instrument) and the accuracy of the calibration is then

verified in the State Metrological Institute of the Czech Republic. Verification is

achieved by comparing the results of measurement of 222Rn concentrations provided by

the Radim3 instrument and a reference instrument using a secondary ATMOS standard

(the ATMOS User Centre is a service of the German Agency, DFD) and then the value of

the calibration factor is adjusted, so that the tested instrument yields the same results as

ATMOS. The overall uncertainty in the calibration procedure is then equal to ±10%, as

the response of the ATMOS reference instrument is known with an error of about ±7%

(Plch, 2001).

The maximum 222Rn concentration that the instrument can measure is 150 kBq m−3 within

a time interval of one hour, whereas the rather low concentration (activity) of 30 Bq m−3

is determined with a statistical accuracy equal to ±20% (for a counting time of only one

hour). The instrument response is 0.8 imp h−1 per Bq m−3.

The system is fitted with an accurate clock and the date and time when the measurement

was started are automatically recorded in the block designation in the memory together

with the block number, number of recordings, background and block status. A maximum

of 9999 records can be stored in one block and thus the maximum time corresponding to

one block is equal to 9999×30 minutes, corresponding to continuous monitoring for a

period of 208 days. The number of blocks is limited by the overall capacity of the

memory, equal to 17963 recordings. The sampling time can be adjusted from 0.5 to 24

hours (Plch, 2001).

6

The radon diffuses into the instrument, where a filter collects the airborne 222Rn decay

product

218Po. The 222Rn concentration is determined by measuring the α-activity of

218Po, which is collected by the electric field on the surface of a semiconductor (Si)

detector from the chamber of the detection system. The latter has an optimised spherical

geometry half of which is formed by a grid covered with two layers of a dense cloth. This

cloth prevents the entrance of airborne 222Rn decay products and protects the detector

against dust and light. Because most of the radon decay products are positively charged,

the vessel is connected to the positive pole of a high-voltage supply and the surface of the

Si detector electrode is connected to the negative pole. The positively charged radon

decay products are neutralized by water vapour and other admixtures, and this effect is

kept low by employing the highest possible electric field. The instrument uses a stabilized

voltage power supply of 2 kV which is controlled by the internal computer (see Fig. 1).

The optimal form of the chamber and the high electric fields applied provide high

experimental sensitivity and reduce the influence of humidity, which is less than 15% for

a change in the relative humidity of 50%. The results obtained are corrected for

humidity. The mean distance between the detector and the chamber is about 6 cm and the

chamber volume is 700 ml. The mean, minimum, and maximum activity concentration

values are calculated in a data block, and the individual results can be read in the display

of Radim3 or transferred via a RS232 connector into a PC. A software program running

under windows allows data storage and various graphics presentation of the results.

The signal from the Si detector is treated by a charged-sensitive low-noise preamplifier

and is amplified in a two-stage shaping amplifier. The output signal is fed from the

amplifier to a single-channel amplitude impulse analyser, which discriminates noise and

7

selects from the amplitude spectra those impulses that are formed by the α−decay of

218Po (with an energy of 6 MeV). The width and position of the window is optimised to

register practically all the α−particles from this decay. The window limits are set between

3.2 and 6.3 MeV, so that the contribution of α−particles from the 214Po decay (with an

energy of 7.7 MeV) is minimal (less than 3%).

In order to keep current consumption as low as possible, the system is equipped with two

internal microprocessors: a small one which is constantly in operation and a large one

that services the display, processes the measuring results and controls communication

with the PC. The small microprocessor carries out amplitude analysis, creates a window

around the α−peak of 218Po, stores the number of impulses and controls high voltage and

other systems. When only the small microprocessor is in operation, the consumption of

the system is about 5 mA, which increases to about 45 mA when in addition the large

microprocessor is put into operation. The latter takes place during preparation of the

measurement, reading of normal data, etc. If no button is pressed over a period of 3

minutes, the large memory processor is automatically turned on “sleep” mode.

2.2. Site selection and counting

Eighty–four buildings and dwellings were selected in 37 different villages and towns in

Cyprus as shown in Table 1 according to the geological features and population

concentrations. The measurements were carried out over 9 months (beginning of

September 2001 to end of May 2002).

Part of the work was also the repetition of certain measurements that had been done

before in Cyprus (Christofides and Christodoulides, 1993), so as to have a comparison of

8

the results. In this part of the work we selected regions (buildings and dwellings) that had

shown high concentrations of 222Rn. Another part of the work was to carry out

measurements of the 222Rn concentration in the area of Pano Polemidia, where a number

of cases of leukemia were reported.

The procedure followed was to contact by telephone the house owners in the various

areas, explain the purpose of the project and following their agreement to arrange an

appointment in order to place the detectors in their houses. Drought–free areas in the

houses were selected for detector placement such as basements, so that the measurements

would show the maximum 222Rn concentrations. The detectors were placed at a height of

approximately 1 meter.

Before starting the measurement, the length of the sampling interval (adjustable from

0.5 to 24 hours) was entered in the Radim3 instrument, usually 4 hours. Prior to

beginning the measurement the future block was marked by entering its number and

determining its length. So, the 222Rn concentration measurement and the storage of the

results in a data block were carried out simultaneously. The data block that is available

could be viewed. The length of the block (number of records) was then entered, usually

12 records (12 222Rn concentrations averaged for each area). Therefore, the instrument

was typically in operation for 48 hours. In this way 222Rn fluctuations during the

measurement could clearly be seen. A typical measurement is shown in figure 2. Prior to

the indoor measurements,

the outdoor 222Rn activity concentration in Cyprus was

measured and showed a typical value of (3.9 ± 0.8) Bq m−3.

9

2.3. Derivation of the indoor radon effective dose rates

In order to estimate the annual effective doses indoors, one has to take into account the

conversion coefficient from absorbed dose in air to effective dose and the indoor

occupancy factor. In the UNSCEAR 2000 Report, the Committee used 9.0 nSv h−1 per

Bq m−3 for the conversion factor (effective dose received by adults per unit 222Rn activity

per unit of air volume), 0.4 for the equilibrium factor of radon indoors and 0.8 for the

indoor occupancy factor. Hence, the effective dose rate indoors in units of mSv y−1, ED,

is calculated by the following formula:

ED (mSv y−−−−1) = Rc ×××× Df ×××× 24 h ×××× 365.25 ×××× Of ×××× Rf ×××× 10−−−−6

(1)

where Rc is the measured 222Rn concentration (in Bq m−3), Df is the dose conversion

factor (9.0 nSv h−1 per Bq m−3), Of is the indoor occupancy factor (0.8), and Rf is the

radon equilibrium factor indoors (0.4).

As an example, for a measured 222Rn concentration of 40.0 Bq m−3 the above formula

yields an effective dose equivalent to the population which is equal to 1.0 mSv y−1.

3. Results and discussion

Table 1 shows the airborne 222Rn concentrations in Cypriot buildings and dwellings as

well as the arithmetic mean (A.M.), the geometric mean (G.M.), the standard deviation of

the mean (S.D.M.), the minimum (Min) and the maximum (Max) 222Rn concentration. As

shown in Table 1, 222Rn activity concentrations ranged from 6.2 to 102.8 Bq m−3, with an

10

overall arithmetic mean value of (19.3 ± 1.6) Bq m−3. Out of the 37 areas measured in

this study, the area of Agia Zoni in the district of Lemesos appears to have the highest

222Rn concentration (102.8 ± 10.1) Bq m−3. The second highest 222Rn concentration

appears in the area of Egkomi in the district of Lefkosia and is (68.6 ± 5.7) Bq m−3. These

two dwellings were investigated further to find out if there is a reason for their relatively

high concentration values. The detectors were placed in the basements of the dwellings.

The basements were closed for the entire duration of the measuring time period (48

hours). The observed high values may be due to a very low air change rate compared to

the normal Cypriot living conditions. On the other hand, the area of Latsia in the district

of Lefkosia appears to have the lowest 222Rn concentration (6.2 ± 0.8) Bq m−3.

In order to obtain a more general and representative overview, the measurements were

classified in 11 main regions of Cyprus, shown in Table 2. In this way, the results from

various measurements belonging to the same region were averaged. As can be seen in

Table 2, the highest mean 222Rn concentration appears in the Lemesos region and is

(29.6 ± 10.7) Bq m−3, whereas the lowest mean 222Rn concentration appears in the centre

of Larnaka region and is (8.6 ± 1.4) Bq m−3.

Figure 3 illustrates the indoor 222Rn concentration for all the 84 buildings and dwellings

studied together with their statistical errors, which are in the range of 10−20%. The

horizontal dashed area shows the arithmetic mean value ± 1 S.D.M. (19.3 ± 1.6) Bq m−3.

Most of the individual measurements are around the arithmetic mean value.

Finally,

the measured 222Rn activity concentration was converted into an indoor

effective dose equivalent to the Cypriot population using equation (1), for all the 84

buildings and dwellings studied. The results are plotted in figure 4 together with their

11

statistical errors and the area covered by the overall arithmetic mean value ± 1 S.D.M

(0.49 ± 0.04) mSv y−1 (horizontal dashed area).

In summary, the present systematic investigations on 222Rn activity concentration in all

the representative villages and towns clearly demonstrate that the radon concentration is

very low in Cyprus. The overall mean value derived (19.3 Bq m−3) is by a factor of two

lower than the reported world average value of 39 Bq m−3 (UNSCEAR 2000 Report).

The results are in the general trend consistent with previous observations (Christofides

and Christodoulides, 1993). They are also consistent with recent

investigations on

terrestrial gamma-radiation measurements in all

the predominant

rock formations

appearing in Cyprus, which have revealed low activity and elemental concentrations of

uranium and thorium radioisotopes (Tzortzis et al., 2002).

4. Conclusions

Airborne 222Rn concentration in dwellings and buildings in most countries is the major

contributor to the annual effective dose equivalent to the population (Nero et al, 1986,

Clarke and Southwood, 1989). From the present systematic measurements, an average

indoor annual effective dose equivalent to the Cypriot population of (0.49 ± 0.04) mSv is

calculated, if the mean value of (19.3 ± 1.6) Bq m−3 and a 222Rn equilibrium factor of 0.4

are used. The extracted value of the annual effective dose equivalent to the Cypriot

population is almost 2 to 3 times less than that quoted in the literature for other countries

worldwide. Note that the world average radon concentration value is reported to be 39

Bq m−3 (UNSCEAR 2000 Report), which corresponds to an annual effective dose to the

population of about 1 mSv.

12

The indoor

222Rn concentration results show a correlation with the geological

formations on which the buildings and dwellings were built. The highest 222Rn

concentrations were in buildings and dwellings built on chalk formations.

Deductively, the results show that the threat from 222Rn in Cypriot buildings and

dwellings is negligible and much lower than the internationally acceptable levels for

safety, which certain countries have recommended. In particular for the region of Pano

Polemidia, the leukemia cases observed there cannot have their origin in high 222Rn

concentrations.

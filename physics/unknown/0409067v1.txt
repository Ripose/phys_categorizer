Abstract 

We propose and analyze a new type of a resonator in an annular geometry which is 

based on a single defect surrounded by radial Bragg reflectors on both sides. We show 

that the conditions for efficient mode confinement are different from those of the 

conventional Bragg waveguiding in a rectangular geometry. A simple and intuitive 

approach to the design of optimal radial Bragg reflectors is proposed and employed, 

yielding chirped gratings. Small bending radii and strong control over the resonator 

dispersion are possible by the Bragg confinement. A design compromise between 

large Free Spectral Range (FSR) requirements and fabrication tolerances is suggested.

1. Introduction 

The last few years, have witnessed a substantial increase of activity dealing with 

utilization of ring resonators for optical communication devices. Various ring-

resonator based applications such as modulators [1], channel drop filters [2] and 

dispersion compensators [3] have been suggested and demonstrated.  

The important characteristics of the modes of ring resonators are the free spectral 

range (FSR) and the loss per revolution, or equivalently the Q-factor. One method for 

realizing tight confinement and high Q is to utilize Bragg reflection instead of total 

internal reflection (as in “conventional” resonators”). Disk resonators based on Bragg 

reflection were analyzed in the past, both for laser and passive resonator applications 

[4-12], employing both coupled mode theory and field transfer matrices.  

In this paper we propose and analyze a new type of ring resonator - an annular defect 

mode resonator which is based on a single annular defect located between radial 

Bragg reflectors. Bragg reflection based disk (i.e., a disk surrounded by concentric 

Bragg layers) and, recently, ring resonators have been studied theoretically and 

demonstrated experimentally [4-13]. Recently, a hexagonal waveguide ring resonator 

based on Photonic Bandgap Crystal (PBC) confinement on both sides of the 

waveguide was demonstrated experimentally [14]. However, this structure exploited 

the specific symmetry of the triangular lattice which enables low loss 60° abrupt turns 

in order to realized a closed resonator. 

The basic geometry is illustrated in Fig. 1. A circumferentially guiding defect is 

located within a medium which consists of annular Bragg layers. Due to the circular 

geometry the layer thicknesses, unlike in rectangular geometry, are not constant [15] 

and our task is to determine the thicknesses which lead to maximum confinement in 

the defect.

In section 2 we develop the matrix formalism for solving for the modal field and in 

section 3 we describe the rules for designing an annular Bragg defect mode resonator. 

In section 4 we describe the dispersion relation and the modal profile of the field. In 

section 5 we analyze the properties of a resonators which are based on higher Bragg 

order reflectors and in section 6 we discuss the results and summarize. 

2. Basic theory 

We consider an azimuthally symmetric structure as illustrated in figure 1. The guiding 

defect which is comprised of a material with refractive index 

n

 is surrounded by 

defect

distributed Bragg reflectors on both sides where the reflectors’ layers are of refractive 

indices  n  and 

1

2n

. All the electromagnetic field components can be expressed by the 

z component of the electrical and magnetic field [15] which satisfy the Helmholtz 

equations which in cylindrical coordinates are given by:

Using relation (8), the field components A and B can be “propagated” from the inner 

layers to the external layers. We use the finiteness of the field at ρ=0 so that B1=0.

The employment of the transfer matrices is important here because, in contrast to 

coupled mode theory [5, 7], it enables an exact analysis of high-contrast Bragg 

structures that cannot be considered as small perturbation.

3. Design rules 

The formalism of section 2 enables us to find the modal field distribution in the case 

of an arbitrary arrangement of annular concentric dielectric rings. We are especially 

interested in structures that can lead to a concentration of the modal energy near a 

predetermined radial distance i.e., in a radial defect mode. 

High efficiency Bragg reflectors in Cartesian coordinates require a constant grating 

period which determines the angles in which an incident wave would be reflected. 

Generally, the grating wavenumber (

Λπ2

 where Λ is the grating period) multiplied 

by the reflection order should be approximately twice the transverse component of the 

incident wave’s wavevector [15]. However, when the structure is annular, the 

conditions for efficient reflection are different.  

Several methods for determining the thickness, and thus the position, of the Bragg 

layers interfaces have been suggested in previous publications [5-8]. Compared to 

Bragg fibers [16], the incident angle of the waves at the interfaces (measured from the 

normal to the interface) is smaller and, therefore, the asymptotic approximation [17] is 

not valid and the “conventional” 

4λ  layers would not be appropriate. The principle 

underlying these methods is to position the layers interfaces at the zeros and extrema 

of the field transverse profile. This strategy ensures the decrease of the field intensity 

for larger radii and the reduction of radiating power from the resonator. Here we 

present a more intuitive, although equivalent, approach to determine the width of the

“conventional” Bragg waveguide design comprising 

4λ  layers of alternating 

refractive indices and a 

2λ  defect. As seen in Fig. 2B, the equivalent index increases 

exponentially with the radius and the equivalent grating period (which is constant in 

the real plane) also increases with the radius. This index profile does not necessarily 

support a guided defect mode. 

In the (U, V) plane, the radial grating are transformed to a series of parallel grating 

normal to the V axis but with an exponential index profile. In order for this structure 

to act as a Bragg reflector, the partial reflections from each interface must interfere 

constructively (see Fig. 3). In order for that to happen, the total phase that the wave

 according to equation (9). The propagation 

factor

 appearing in (13) is determined by the azimuthal wavenumber m: 

RmV =β

 

Equation (13) was used to calculate the structures required for the high reflection 

Bragg mirrors surrounding the defect. Assuming the Bragg reflectors on both sides 

have identical reflection phase, then the defect width must be 

"λ  in the sense of 

"2

eq. (13), i.e. the defect must satisfy:

(15) 

where the integer l indicates the number of the Bessel periods (or the radial modal 

number) of the field in the defect.  

It follows that the width of the defect and Bragg layers depends on their coordinate U 

(or ρ) because the equivalent index 

 is a function of U.  

eqn

resonator. The high index layers have effective refractive index ( n ) of 2 while the

low index layers and the defect have effective refractive index of 1. The internal and 

external Bragg reflectors have 5 and 10 periods respectively, the wavelength is 

1.55µm and the azimuthal wavenumber is 7. The defect is located approximately at 

ρ=5.6µm and it is 0.85µm wide. 

Fig. 5 shows the width of the high-index (stars) and low-index (circles) layers. At 

small radii the layers’ width is wider because the equivalent index is lower there. The 

layers’ width decreases for larger radii and approaches asymptotically the 

“conventional” quarter wavelength width - 

n4λ . The two exceptionally wider low-

index layers in Fig. 5 are the first low-index layer (ρ=0-2µm) and the defect which 

has a 

"λ  width. 

"2

4. Modal solution properties 

Because of the design method (

"λ  layers and 

"4

"λ  defect) the resonator has a 

"2

single radial mode which its peak is located almost exactly in the middle of the defect 

(see also Fig. 4). This is unlike the field profile of conventional ring resonators in 

which the field peak tends to shifts towards the exterior radius of the waveguide due 

to the increase on the equivalent 

 index in larger radii. Nevertheless, the 

wqn

asymmetry of the field profile (with respect to the intensity peak) which is due to the 

radial structure is noticeable.  

Fig. 6 shows the dispersion curve of the annular defect resonator presented in Fig. 5. 

The vertical and horizontal axes indicate respectively the wavelength and the 

azimithal wavenumber m. The circles indicate the resonance wavelengths and the 

solid line represent a quadratic interpolation:

. The resonator free spectral range (FSR) 

 

 

10

around 1.55µm is approximately 20nm and it increases for shorter wavelengths. It is 

interesting to note that the quadratic term is the most dominant term in the 

determination of the resonator FSR.  

Figure 7 depicts the transverse profile of the modal fields corresponding to changing 

the azimuthal wavenumber from m=6 to 10. It is evident that the transverse profile is 

almost identical although the resonance wavelength changes over more than 100nm. 

The reason for that is that transverse profile is primarily determined by the Bragg 

layers widths (or spatial frequency) which is wavelength independent. This feature is 

an important advantage compared to conventional ring resonators because coupling 

between resonators of this type and Bragg waveguides, which is determined primarily 

by the modal profiles overlap, can be expected to be almost wavelength independent.  

Figs. 8, 9 show the dispersion and the transverse profiles of m=6 to 12 for a Bragg 

defect resonators utilizing lower refractive index contrast. For this structure,

, the internal and external Bragg layers have both 40 

periods and it was designed for m=10 at 1.55µm. The defect is located at ρ=10.85µm 

and its width is approximately 0.27µm. Because of the lower contrast, more Bragg 

layers are needed in order to realize good mode confinement and, as a result, the 

resonator is larger and the FSR is smaller (about 96GHz at 1.55µm).  

As shown in Fig. 8, the dispersion curve of this resonator is also quadratic and given

5. Higher order Bragg reflectors 

Although the chirped quarter wavelength Bragg layers form an optimal reflector, their 

implementation could prove to be difficult. Because the layers’ spatial period 

changes, some of the conventional photolithography methods which are employed for 

uniform (not chirped) Bragg gratings [20] cannot be used. A possible approach to 

overcome this problem is to position the interfaces in non-sequential zeros/extrema, 

i.e. allow the Bessel function in each layer to complete a full period before changing 

the index. From the Bragg reflection point of view, such approach is equivalent to 

utilizing  (
)

 layers or employing higher reflection order of the Bragg stack. 

Practically, the layer width can be evaluated in a similar fashion to the quarter 

wavelength structure but the layers have to satisfy the following condition:

(16) 

The resulting structure would have wider layers and would, therefore, be larger and 

exhibit smaller FSR. Fig. 10 compares between the field transverse profile of Fig. 4 

(A) and the transverse profile of a resonator designed for similar mode parameters (5 

internal periods, 10 external periods m=7 for λ=1.55µm) utilizing wider layers (B). 

The radius at which the field amplitude peaks is more than twice larger than the 

original (11.35µm Vs. 5.6µm) and the radial decay of the field rate is smaller. Fig. 11 

depicts the dispersion curve of the higher order Bragg based resonator. As expected, 

the FSR of the resonator is significantly smaller than that of the original one 

(approximately 3nm at 1.55µm). The main reason for this decrease in the FSR is the 

increase in the defect radius. However, since the lower index layers are inherently 

 

 

 

12

wider (especially in the lower radii regime), they could be realized utilizing quarter 

wavelength layers while the high-index would be realized as a higher order Bragg 

layer. Moreover, depending on the radius and the index, the Bragg order of each layer 

could be determined separately to achieve the largest FSR. 

Fig. 12 depicts the dispersion curve of a ring resonator designed for the same 

parameters as those shown in Figs. 4 and 9 where the low-index layers are first order 

Bragg layers and the high-index layers are second order Bragg layers. The 

implementation of the composite structure increased the FSR from 3nm to ~8nm 

without requiring smaller features. As for the other Bragg defect resonators shown 

here, the modal transverse profile of this resonator is almost wavelength independent. 

6. Discussion and Summary 

We have analyzed annular defect mode ring resonator based of radial Bragg 

reflectors. We also presented a simple and intuitive method to design the reflection 

gratings of such resonators. We saw that extremely small resonators (few microns in 

diameter) exhibiting large FSR can be realized utilizing relatively low index 

materials. 

Several configurations to realize the Bragg reflectors were suggested and analyzed. 

The straightforward configuration (each layer serves as an equivalent quarter 

wavelength plate) offers the smallest resonator exhibiting the largest FSR. On the 

other hand, manufacturing of such device may require the realization of small and 

accurate features, especially if the optimal gratings structure is required. Employment 

of higher-order Bragg gratings relaxes the tolerances on the gratings width but 

deteriorates the FSR. 

 

 

13

The composite configuration, i.e. tailoring each layer Bragg order and width 

according to its refractive index and radius, seems to be the best compromise between 

large FSR and realizable features. Quarter wavelength layers can be easily realized if 

the material refractive index is low or if the layer is positioned in a small radius where 

the equivalent index, 

, is low. Employing the thinnest possible Bragg layers is 

eqn

important especially for the internal Bragg reflector because this would determine the 

defect radius and hence, the FSR. The external Bragg reflector could be realized using 

higher-order Bragg layers without a major influence on the resonator performances. 

The more tolerant higher Bragg order resonators design enables a relatively simple 

realization by conventional photolithography techniques in a variety of material 

systems such as GaAs, InP and polymers.

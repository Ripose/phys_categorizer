Abstract:  Artificially  structured  metamaterials  have  enabled  unprecedented  flexibility 
in manipulating electromagnetic waves and producing new functionalities, including the 
cloak of invisibility based on coordinate transformation. Here we present the design of a 
non-magnetic cloak operating at optical frequencies. The principle and structure of the 
proposed cylindrical cloak are analyzed, and the general recipe for the implementation 
of  such  a  device  is  provided.  The  cloaking  performance  is  verified  using  full-wave 
finite-element simulations. 
 
The  recently  proposed  electromagnetic  cloak  based  on  coordinate  transformation  has 
opened  a  new  door  for  the  applications  of  metamaterials1,2.  Unlike  other  cloaking 
approaches3, ,4 5 which are typically limited to sub-wavelength objects, the transformation 
method allows the design of cloaking devices to render a macroscopic object invisible. 
In  addition,  the  design  is  not  sensitive  to  the  object  that  is  being  cloaked.  The  first 
experimental  demonstration  of  such  a  cloak  at  microwave  frequencies  was  recently 
reported6. We note, however, that the design used6 cannot be implemented for an optical 
cloak, which is certainly of particular interest because optical frequencies are where the 
word “invisibility” is conventionally defined.

In this paper  we  present  the design  of a non-magnetic  cloak  operating at optical 
frequencies.  The  coordinate  transformation  used  in  the  proposed  cloak  of  cylindrical

geometry is similar to that in Ref. 6, by which a cylindrical region  r
into  a  concentric  cylindrical  shell  a

results in the following requirements for the anisotropic permittivity and permeability in 
the cloaking shell6,7:

For TE illumination with incident electrical field polarized along the z axis, only εz, μr 
and  μθ  in  equation  (1)  enter  into  Maxwell’s  equations.  Moreover,  the  dispersion 
properties  and  wave  trajectory  in  the  cloaking  shell  remain  the  same  as  long  as  the 
values of εiμz and μiεz are kept constant, where i represents either r or θ . All these have 
been addressed in the recent microwave experiments6, where the cloaking was achieved 
by varying the dimensions of a series of split ring resonators (SRRs) to yield a desired 
gradient of permeability in the radial direction. However, this approach cannot be used 
for  an  optical  cloak.  It  is  a  known  fact  that  there  are  intrinsic  limits  to  the  scaling  of 
SRR size in order to exhibit a magnetic response in the optical range8,9. Replacing the 
SRRs with other optical magnetic structures like  paired nano-rods10 or nano-strips11 is 
also  a  very  challenging  approach  primarily  due  to  fabrication  difficulties.  The 
layer-by-layer  fashion of optical or e-beam lithography is not compatible with making 
closed  surfaces  such  as  a  cloak.  Moreover,  optical  magnetism  based  on  such  resonant

plasmonic structures is usually associated with a high loss factor, which is detrimental 
to the performance of cloaking devices. 

In contrast to the reported design of a microwave cloak with TE polarization6, we 
focus on TM incidence with the magnetic field polarized along the z axis.  In this case 
only μz, εr and εθ must satisfy the requirements in (1), and the dispersion relations inside 
the cloak remain unaffected as long as the products of μzεr and μzεθ are kept the same as 
those determined by the values in (1). It is worth noting that unlike the TE case, under 
TM illumination only one component of μ is of interest, which allows us to completely 
remove the need for any optical magnetism. In (1) we multiply εr and εθ by the value of 
μz and obtain the following reduced set of cloak parameters:

Compared to the cloak with ideal properties as shown in (1), the reduced parameters in 
equation  (2)  provide  the  same  wave  trajectory.  The  only  adverse  effect  of  using  the 
reduced  set  is  that  the  impedance  at  the  outer  boundary  is  not  perfectly  matched  and 
hence some reflection will exist. 

The  non-magnetic  nature  of  the  system  as  indicated  in  (2)  removes  the  most 
challenging  issue  of  the  design.  The  azimuthal  permittivity  εθ  is  a  constant  with  a 
magnitude larger than 1, which can be easily achieved in conventional dielectrics. The 
key  to  the  implementation  is  to  construct  the  cylindrical  shell  with  the  desired  radial 
distribution of εr varying from 0 at the inner boundary of the  cloak (r = a) to 1 at the 
outer surface (r = b). 

Artificial  dielectrics  with  positive  permittivity  less  than  unity  were  first  studied 
more than half a century ago12 and are still of interest to metamaterial researchers13. In 
our  design,  the  required  distribution  of  εr  is  realized  by  using  metal  wires  of 
subwavelength size in the radial direction embedded in a dielectric material, as shown in 
Fig.  1b.  The  aspect  ratio  of  the  metal  wires,  defined  by  the  ratio  of  the  length  to  the 
radius  of  the  wire,  is  denoted  by  α.  The  whole  structure  of  the  cloaking  system 
resembles a round hair brush, except that in a real device the “bristles” of such a brush 
can consist of disconnected smaller pieces. The spatial positions of the rods don’t have 
to be periodic and can be random. 

The shape-dependent electromagnetic response of a subwavelength particle can be 
characterized by the Lorentz depolarization factor q. For an ellipsoid of semiaxes ai, aj 
and ak with electric field polarized along ai, the depolarization factor is expressed by14

The  screening  factor κ  of  a  particle  is  related  to  q  by 
.  Note  that  a  long 
wire  with  large  aspect  ratio  α  results  in  a  small  depolarization  factor  and  a  large 
screening factor, which indicate strong interactions between the field and the wires. For 
a  composite  cloak  with  metal  wires  as  inclusions  in  a  dielectric,  the  electromagnetic 
properties  are  well-described  by  “shape-dependent”  effective-medium  theory  (EMT). 
The effective permittivity εeff for a composite material comprising metal particles with 
permittivity εm, a volume filling factor f and screening factor κ, along with a dielectric 
component with permittivity εd and a filling factor 1-f, is given by15

For  spherical  particles  with  q  =  1/3  and  κ  =  2,  the  equation  above  reduces  to  the

The  benefit  of  using  metal  wires  in  a  composite  cloak  is  that  the  radial 
permittivity εr determined by (5) may exhibit a positive value less than 1 with minimal 
imaginary  part.  For  the  structure  in  Fig.  1b,  it  is  easy  to  see  that  the  volume  filling 
fraction is inversely proportional to r. To be more specific, the filling fraction in (5) for 
calculating εr is ( )
, with Pa being the surface coverage ratio of metal at the 
f r
inner surface of the cloak (r = a). The filling fractions f at the inner and outer surface of 
the  cloak  are  Pa  and  Pa⋅(a/b)  respectively,  and  the  overall  metal  filling  fraction  in  the 
whole  cloak  layer  is  Pa⋅2a/(a+b).  The  azimuthal  permittivity  εθ  inside  the  cloak  is 
essentially  the  same  as  that  of  the  dielectric  because  the  response  of  the  wires  to  the 
angular electrical field Eθ oriented normal to the wires is small and at low metal filling 
factors it can be neglected.

For practical applications, it is important to design a cloaking device operating at a 
pre-set  operational  wavelength λop.  For  this  purpose  the  design  process  is  as  follows. 
First we choose materials for the metal wires and the surrounding dielectric. Second, we 
calculate the values of f0 and f1 as functions of the aspect ratio α at λop using the EMT 
model  in  (5).  The  required  aspect  ratio  for λop  is  the  one  that  satisfies  equation  (10). 
Then,  the  geometrical  factors  of  the  cloak,  including  Rab  and  Pa,  can  be  determined 
based  on  equations  (8)  and  (9).  Note  that  the  same  design  works  for  all  similar 
cylindrical  cloaks  with  the  same  shape  factor  Rab.  We  emphasize  again  that  such 
cloaking device can be used for large objects. 

As  a  practical  example,  we  have  designed  an  optical  cloak  operating  at  the 
commonly  used  wavelength  of  632.8  nm  (He-Ne  laser)  and  consisting  of  silver  and 
silica. The equations (5), (7) and (10) together  yield the desired aspect ratio α = 10.7, 
and  the  volume  filling  fractions  at  the  two  boundaries  are  f0  =  0.125  and  f1  =  0.039, 
respectively. Then with (8) and (9) we find the shape factor of the cylindrical cloak to 
be Rab = 0.314, while the surface coverage ratio at the inner boundary is  Pa = 12.5%. 
The effective parameters of μz, εr and εθ from this design together with the exact set of 
reduced parameters determined by equation (2) are shown in Fig. 2. We can see that μz 
and  εθ  perfectly  match  the  theoretical  requirements  throughout  the  cylindrical  cloak. 
The  radial  permittivity εr  fits  the  values  required  by  equation  (2)  exactly  at  the  two 
boundaries of the cloak, and follows the overall tendency very well inside the cloak.

To  validate  if  the  required  distribution  of  permittivity  could  be  achieved  using 
prolate spheroidal silver nanowires embedded in a silica tube, we use three-dimensional 
full-wave 
solver  COMSOL 
MULTIPHYSICS  to  determine  the  effective  anisotropic  permittivity  of  a  unit  cell  with 
sub-wavelength dimensions. We start with a homogenization method6, where the actual 
unit cells (cylindrical sectors) with different electromagnetic surroundings at the inner 
and outer curved boundaries are substituted by cells made of right rectangular prisms, as 
shown in Fig. 3. The curvature of the actual unit cells is relatively low, thus we assume 
that converting the cylindrical segment into the rectangular prism introduces minuscule 
change  to  the  effective  permittivity.  For  a  wavelength  of  632.8  nm,  we  fix  two 
dimensions  of  the  unit  cell  (height,  hc  =  12.5  nm  and  length,  lc  =  100  nm),  while 
changing  the  width  wc  proportional  to  the  radius  of  each  layer.  The  full-wave 
θε′
finite-element (FE) numerical analysis confirms that the range of desired 
 
agrees  well  with  those  predicted  by  EMT.  For  the  equivalent  rectangular  unit  cell 
encapsulating  a  spheroidal  silver  nanowire  with  the  dimensions  initially  calculated 
through EMT (diameter d = 7 nm and length l = 75 nm), the effective permittivity 
 
rε′
fits  relatively  well  to  the  desired  values,  with  a  discrepancy  of  around  10%.  The 
required  effective  material  properties 
  can  be  achieved  precisely  by 
additionally adjusting the diameter of the rod to d = 6 nm (d = 5 nm), and length to l = 
71  nm  (  l  =  60  nm)  for  the  external  (internal)  cell.  As  for  the  loss  feature,  the  FE

simulations  show  that  the  radial  permittivity  εr  has  an  imaginary  part  of  about  0.1 
throughout  the  cloak.  Although  this  is  a  very  small  value  for  metal-dielectric 
metamaterials, it may still weaken the cloaking effect. It is possible to fully compensate 
the  loss  by  using  a  gain  medium  as  already  proposed  for  applications  of  perfect 
tunneling transmittance4 and lossless negative-index materials18,19. 

To illustrate the performance of the proposed non-magnetic optical cloak with a 
design  corresponding  to  Fig.  2  and  operating  at λop  =  632.8  nm,  we  performed  field 
mapping  simulations  using  a  commercial  FE  package  (COMSOL  MULTIPHYSICS).  The 
simulation  approach  is  similar  to  Ref.  7  but  with  the  important  difference  that  our 
cloaking  device  is  designed  for  optical  wavelengths  with  TM incident  light  instead  of 
the TE mode at microwave frequencies. The object hidden inside the cloaked region is 
an  ideal  metallic  cylinder  with  radius  r  =  a.  The  simulation  domain  also  consisted  of 
PML layers at all the boundaries to absorb the outgoing waves. The simulated results of 
magnetic field distribution around the cloaked object together with the power flow lines 
are  illustrated  in  Fig.  4.  We  note  that  the  size  of  the  cloak  is  more  than  six  times  the 
operational wavelength, while the simulated area is more than 20 times the wavelength. 
Hence  both  of  these  sizes  are  significantly  larger  than  the  wavelength  used  in  the 
calculations. Fig. 4a shows the field distribution around the metal cylinder surrounded 
by the designed cloak with parameters given by the diamond markers in Fig. 2. With the 
cloak (Fig. 4a) the wave fronts flow around the cloaked region with remarkably small 
perturbation, while without the cloak (Fig. 4b) the waves around the object are severely 
distorted and an evident shadow is cast behind the cylinder. These simulations clearly 
show the capability of reducing the scattering from the object hidden inside the cloaked 
region. 

We  have  demonstrated  a  design  of  an  optical  cloak  based  on  coordinate 
transformation.  The  non-magnetic  nature  of  our  design  eases  the  pain  of  constructing 
gradient  magnetic  metamaterials  in  three-dimensional  space,  and  therefore  paves  the 
way for the realization of cloaking devices at optical frequencies. The proposed design 
can  be  generalized  to  cloaks  with  other  metal  structures,  such  as  chains  of  metal 
nanoparticles or thin continuous or semi-continuous metal strips. It can be also adopted 
for other than the optical spectral ranges, including the infrared and the microwave.We 
note  that  the  achievable  invisibility  with  the  proposed  cloak  is  not  perfect  due  to 
impedance  mismatch  associated  with  the  reduced  material  specifications  and  the 
inevitable loss in a metal-dielectric structure. Moreover, any shell-type cloak design can 
work only over a narrow frequency range, because the curved trajectory of light implies 
a  refractive  index  n  of  less  than  1  in  order  to  satisfy  the  minimal  optical  path 
requirement  of  Fermat’s  principle,  while  any  metamaterial  with  n  <  1  must  be 
dispersive to fulfill causality. However, we believe that even rudimentary  designs and 
implementations of an optical cloak are of great potential interest and bring us one step 
closer to the ultimate optical illusion of invisibility.

cloaked object with TM illumination at λ = 632.8 nm. a, The object is inside the designed 

metal wire composite cloak with parameters given by the diamond markers in Fig. 2. b, The 

object is surrounded by vacuum without the cloak. The concentric circles represent the two 

boundaries of the cloak at r = a and r = b, respectively. The hidden object is an ideal metallic 

cylinder with radius r = a.

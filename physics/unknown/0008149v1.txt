Injected  beam  energy  and  energy  spread  are  critical 
parameters  affecting  the  performance  of  our  rapid 
cycling  synchrotron 
real-time  energy 
monitoring  system  is  being  installed  to  examine  the  H- 
beam  out  of  the  Intense  Pulsed  Neutron  Source  (IPNS) 
50 MeV linac.  The 200 MHz Alvarez linac serves as the 
injector for the 450 MeV IPNS RCS.  The linac provides 
an 80 m s macropulse of approximately 3x1012 H- ions 30 
times  per  second  for  coasting-beam  injection  into  the 
RCS.    The  RCS  delivers  protons  to  a  heavy-metal 
spallation  neutron  target  for  material  science  studies.  
Using  a  number  of  strip-line  beam  position  monitors 
(BPMs) distributed along the 50 MeV transport line from 
the linac to the RCS, fast signals from the strip lines are 
digitized  and  transferred  to  a  computer  which  performs 
an  FFT.

oscilloscope  bandwidth  are  made  in  the  frequency 
domain.    Rectangular  pulse  train  phasing  (RPTP)  is 
imposed  on  the  spectra  prior  to  obtaining  the  inverse 
transform  (IFFT).    After  the  IFFT,  the  reconstructed 
time-domain  signal  is  analyzed  for  pulse  width  as  it 
progresses  along  the  transport  line.    Time-of-flight 
measurements of the BPM signals provide beam energy.

1  INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION

(upstream) 

the  50  MeV  Linac 

The Intense Pulsed Neutron Source (IPNS) accelerator 
system  is  equipped  with  a  number  of  strip-line,  beam 
position monitors (BPMs) along the 40-m transport line 
from 
the  Rapid  Cycling 
Synchrotron  (RCS).    Operating  at  30  Hz,  the  RCS 
delivers  450  MeV  protons  to  a  heavy  metal  target 
generating  spallation  neutrons  for  material  science 
research.    Here  we  describe  how  signals  from  the  first 
four 
the 
50 MeV line are used to determine bunch width, energy, 
and  energy  spread  in  the  beam.    Injected  beam  energy 
spread  plays  an  important  role  in  determining  the 
stability  of  circulating  charge  within  a  synchrotron.  
Advancements  in  the  speed  of  sampling  oscilloscopes 
and  the  rapid  increase  in  processing  power  available 
from 
real-time 
measurement  of  the  output  microbunch  shape  from  the 
linac.  As the bunch travels along the transport line, its 
longitudinal size grows due to energy spread within the

The  IPNS  Alvarez,  drift  tube  linac  (DTL)  began 
operation  in  1961  as  the  injector  for  the  Zero  Gradient 
Synchrotron  (ZGS).    In  1981  after  the  ZGS  program 
ended, the linac became the injector for IPNS RCS.  The 
linac  typically  delivers  3.5-3.7x1012  H-  ions  to  the  RCS 
during  an  80-m s  macropulse.    During  the  early  days  of 
the  linac,  the  energy  spread  was  measured  to  be  0.37 
MeV.  From numerical modeling, the capture efficiency 
of  the  RCS  at  injection  is  optimized  near  a  momentum 
spread  of  0.3  percent  or  approximately  0.3  MeV.  
Instabilities arise if the energy spread is too low, whereas 
high losses occur if the spread is too high; in either case, 
RCS efficiency is reduced.  A shift in energy during the 
macropulse  effectively  acts  to  increase  energy  spread 
during injection into the RCS. 

2  EXPERIMENTAL ARRANGEMENT 
The  Energy  Spread  and  Energy  Monitor  (ESEM) 
diagnostic  is  presented  schematically  in  Figure  1.    The 
upstream electrode of the first BPM (BPM 1) is located 
5.455  m  from  the  output  flange  of  the  last  DTL  tank.  
The  set  of  four  BPMs  included  in  the  ESEM  cover  a 
distance of 16.627 m along the beam path.  This distance 
is  sufficient 
the 
longitudinal size of the bunch without interference from 
the  return  signal  generated  at  the  downstream  electrode 
of the BPM.

3  DESCRIPTION OF MEASUREMENTS 
3.1  Pulsewidth 

Time  signals  from  the  BPMs  are  recorded  on  a 
Tektronix  model  TDS694c  oscilloscope.    The  TDS694c 
has  a  3  GHz  bandwidth  and  samples  4  channels 
independently  at  1010  samples/sec  (10  GS/s).    The 
oscilloscope  is  controlled  and  data  transferred  via  a 
GPIB-to-Ethernet interface.  This allows an office PC on 
the network to communicate with the oscilloscope.  After 
receiving  the  initial  trigger  pulse  from  the  chopper,  the 
oscilloscope waits for a controlled amount of time before 
triggering its four channels.  The delay time is adjustable 
to  allow  for  temporal  examination  of  the  macropulse.  
Once 
the  delay  period  has  expired,  oscilloscope 
triggering is enabled for the next zero crossing detected 
on channel one.  When the zero crossing is detected, all 
four channels are triggered simultaneously.  The trigger 
time  establishes 
for  energy 
measurements.    A  sampled  waveform  from  BPM  1  is 
presented in Figure 2.

signals  from 
  An 
attenuation  correction[3]  that  is  a  function  of  frequency 
and  cable  length  is  applied  to  each  spectrum.    Finally, 
when performing the inverse transform, Fourier filtering 
is  performed  to  remove  low-level  signals  lost  in  the 
noise.    The  pulsewidth  is  determined  by  evaluating  the 
following time function,

where  Fn  is  the  amplitude  of  the  nth    harmonic  of  the 
beam  bunch  determined  from  the  FFT.    Employing 
rectangular  pulse  train  phasing  (RPTP),  f n  may  be 
expressed as,

The  original  phase  is  also  available  from  the  FFT  by 
taking  the  inverse  tangent  of  the  ratio  of  imaginary  to 
real  parts  of  the  signal.    Figure  3  presents  the  cable-
corrected FFT spectrum for the time data given in Figure 
2.    Also  indicated  in  the  figure  is  the  threshold  level.  
Finally, the reconstructed time signals using both RPTP 
and  original  phasing  are  given  in  Figure  4.    The  pulse 
shape  in  either  case  is  similar  to  the  “bipolar  doublet” 
described by Shafer[4] and shown by Kramer[1].

Once signals from the BPMs have been collected and 
transferred  to  the  PC,  the  data  can  be  displayed  and 
analyzed.    Data  analysis  is  implemented  using  Visual 
Basic.  Analysis of the signals begins with rebinning the 
data  to  obtain  data  sets  with  2N samples as required for 
the FFT[2]. 

In order to examine the same bunch on all four BPMs 
and account for cable delays, a data window of 100 ns or 
longer  is  required.    It  is  also  desirable  have  good 
frequency  response  for  parameters  derived  from  the 
entire  FFT.    A  100  ns  window  allows  us  to  look  at 
parameters derived from the FFT up to 5 MHz (Nyquist).  
A  period  of  100  ns  is  a  good  compromise  between 
resolution  in  the  FFT  and  frequency  response  of  the 
derived  parameters.    Extending  the  sample  window 
requires more time but also provides at cleaner signal. 

After  carrying  out  the  FFT,  the  spectra  are  converted 
to dBm and corrected for cable attenuation and insertion 
losses.  RG-213 coax cable is employed to carry the beam

the 

four  BPMs. 

  Time-of-flight 

Energy is determined by tracking a single microbunch 
through 
(TOF) 
measurements  require  accurate  knowledge  of  the  cable 
lengths between the BPMs and the oscilloscope, and the 
distance  travelled  by  the  beam  along  the  transport  line.  
Cable lengths are determined by TDR.  The path length 
of  the  beam  is  measured  directly  or  taken  from  survey 
data. 

The energy is calculated from the measured velocity of 
the bunch.  Velocity is determined by measuring the TOF 
and  correcting  for  signal  propagation  delays  along  the 
cables.    The  time  required  for  the  signals  from  a  given 
bunch to reach the oscilloscope may be expressed as,

In  theory,  all  four  permutations  should  generate  the 
same  result;  in  reality,  fd  may  be  varied  to  provide  the 
least  rms  error.    Initial  data  indicate  fd  is  not  a  fixed 
parameter but varies significantly from sample to sample 
within a range of – 4.  Negative values generally correlate 
with  lower  energy  spread,  whereas  the  highest  positive 
values tend to correspond to the largest energy spread.

The  maximum  average  current  that  the  RCS  has 
achieved is 15.5 m A, reached in May of this year prior to 
the  annual  summer  shutdown.    Since  restarting  the 
machine  on  August  1st,  maximum  current  has  been 
limited  to  about  14.8  m A.    The  ESEM  diagnostic  was 
first  put  into  service  in  May  and  observed  some  of  the 
higher  current  operations.    ESEM  energy  data  recorded 
in May and August are presented in Figure 5. 

ESEM energy data suggest that a greater fluctuation in 
linac energy during the August 2000 run may be limiting 
the  efficiency  of  the  RCS.    Further  tests  are  being 
planned to determine the validity of this supposition.

3.3  Energy Spread

is  obtained  by 

three-size 
measurement technique[5] neglecting space charge.  The 
advantage  of  this  method  is  that  it  provides  the 
longitudinal  Twiss  parameters  and  therefore  gives  an 
indication of axial focussing (i.e., rf fields) at the output 
of the DTL.  The section of beam line between BPMs 2 
and 3 includes two  p /6 sector dipole magnets, both with 
0.8 m radius of bend.  Though the dipoles cannot affect 
the energy or energy spread of the beam, they do cause a 
change  in  the  longitudinal  size  of  the  beam  through 
dispersion and coupling with the horizontal plane.  This 
effect is introduced into the longitudinal transfer matrix 
by  adjusting  the  path  length  between  BPM  2  and  3.    The 
dipole length factor, fd, can be included in the drift-space 
transfer  matrix  Rd(s).    Labeling  the  three  drift  spaces 
between  the  four  BPMs  as  s1,  s2,  and  s3,  the  transfer 
matrix  between  BPM  1  and  3  for  the  123  measurement 
can be written as,

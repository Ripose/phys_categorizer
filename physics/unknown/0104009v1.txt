Are electromagnetic phenomena derivable from extended 
Einstein equations?

Abstract 

 
A new term describing interactions between charge and potentials may be 
 
added  to  the  right  hand  side  of  Einstein¢ s  equations.  In  the  proposed  term  an 
additional  tensor  has been introduced containing a charge density, analogous to 
the energy-momentum tensor containing a mass density. (The contribution of the 
electromagnetic  fields  has  not  been  considered  in  this  work.)  The  metric 
components in the new equations may contain charge and mass contributions. 
 
In  the  special  relativistic  case  a  set  of four vacuum Maxwell equations is 
deduced from the new equations containing a special relativistic charge density. A 
related  result was recently found by Jefimenko from a special relativistic trans-
formation. Moreover, from the postulated equations the usual special relativistic 
electric  energy  and  Lorentz  force  can  be  calculated,  when  the  approximated 
electromagnetic  metric  is  used.  In  the  non-relativistic  case  the  usual  Maxwell 
equations with rest charge density are obtained. 
 
In the presence of a static gravitational field a set of four Maxwell equations 
is obtained applying in the general relativistic case. From these equations the ge-
nerally accepted isotropic velocity of light can be deduced. In addition, calculated 
generalized Maxwell equations show that vacuum permittivity and permeability 
may differ from unity value in the presence of a big charge Q or a big mass M. 

 

1. Introduction

Using  special  relativistic  transformations  Jefimenko  [1]  recently  generalized  the 
vacuum  Maxwell  equations.  In  his  equations  the  usual  charge  density was replaced by a 
special relativistic charge density r  given by 
 
 
 
Here  r 0  is  the  rest  charge  density,  analogous  to  the  rest  mass  density  in  the  theory  of 
special relativity, v is the (relativistic) velocity of the charge element and c is the velocity 
of light. 
 
Landau and Lifshitz [2 (§90)] and Van Bladel [3 (ch. 9)] (see also [4 (§ 22.4), 5 (§ 
20)] deduced vacuum Maxwell equations at relativistic velocities and in the presence of a 
gravitational field. They obtained these equations from a pair of basic relations containing 
the  electromagnetic  field  tensors  Fij  and  Fij.  In  absence  of  a  gravitational  field  the 
generalized Maxwell equations in [2], however, do not yield the special relativistic charge 
density r  of (1) but the rest charge density r 0. 
 
[2, 3] predict an isotropic light velocity c¢  of magnitude  
 
 
 
Here G is the gravitational constant, M is a big mass, R is the scalar value of R, the radius 
vector  from  mass  M  to  a  charge  q0  associated  with  a  mass  m0  and  F   =  –  GM/R  is  the

Newtonian  potential  working  on  m0.  (Throughout  this  paper  it  will  be  assumed  that 
GM/c2R  << 1.) However, result (2) is not satisfying, since for the isotropic light velocity 
one expects instead of (2) 
 
 
 
In  this  paper  Jefimenko¢ s  special  relativistic  vacuum  Maxwell  equations  and 
 
general  relativistic  Maxwell  equations  yielding  the  light  velocity  of  (3) are deduced from 
a  new  set  of  postulated  equations,  partly  analogous  to  Einstein¢ s  gravitational  equations. 
The  generalized  Maxwell  equations show that vacuum permittivity and permeability may 
differ  from  unity  value  in  the  presence  of  an  additional  big  charge  Q  or  a  big  mass  M. 
Moreover, in the special relativistic case starting from the electromagnetic metric the total 
electric energy and the Lorentz force are obtained. 
 
It  is  noticed  that  the  demonstrated  reduction  of  the  proposed  equations  leading  to 
the  non-relativistic  Maxwell  equations  corresponds  to  the reduction of Einstein¢ s gravita-
tional  equations  to  a  set  of  four  gravito-magnetic  equations  (see,  e.  g.,  Peng  and  Wang 
[6], Biemond [7] and de Matos and Becker [8]). In our discussion attention will be paid to 
this remarkable mirror character between electromagnetic and gravitational phenomena. 
 
In  addition,  the  so-called  Wilson-Blackett  law  can  be  derived  from  the  gravito-
magnetic  equations,  if  the  “magnetic-type”  gravitational  field  B  is  identified  as  a 
magnetic  induction  field.  The  Wilson-Blackett  law  approximately  predicts  the  observed 
magnetic  fields  of  rotating  bodies  ranging  from  rotating  metallic  cylinders  in  the 
laboratory,  moons,  planets,  stars,  up  to  the  Galaxy  in  an  amazing  way.  Therefore,  the 
gravito-magnetic  theory  may  explain  the  origin  of  the  magnetic  fields  of  celestial  bodies 
as a bonus (see [7] for an extended discussion). 
 

2. New “Einstein” equations 

 

(4) 

Rij – 1/2gij R = – 2p c-4q0(m0)-1Qij = – 2p c-4qsQij 

 
The  following  postulated  equations,  partly  analogous  to  Einstein¢ s  gravitational 
 
equations,  will  be  the  starting  point  of  the present approach (compare with [2 (§ 95, pp. 
330–332), 4 (ch. 17), 9 (ch. 7)]) 
 
 
 
In  these  equations  the  tensor  components  Rij  and  R  have  their  usual  mathematical  form. 
The  quantities  q0  and m0 denote the charge and the mass in the same volume element dV 
and the specific charge qs is defined by qs ”
 q0(m0)-1. The energy-momentum tensor Tij in 
Einstein¢ s  equations  has,  however,  been  replaced  by  an  analogous  current  density  tensor 
Qij containing a rest charge density r 0 instead of a mass density. Note that the right hand 
side  of  (4)  lacks  the  gravitational  constant  G  and  differs  from  Einstein¢ s  equations  by  a 
factor  –  1/4  and  the  specific  charge  qs  ”
  q0(m0)-1.  The  last  factor  reflects  that  charge  is 
associated  with  mass,  as  will  become  more  clear  in  the  discussion  of  the  special  relati-
vistic  electric  energy  and  the  Lorentz  force  below.  It  is  noticed,  that  no  electromagnetic 
field  contribution  has  been  included  in  the  right  hand  side  of  (4)  (see,  e.  g.,  Landau  and 
Lifshitz  [2  (§  33)]  for  that  contribution).  Moreover,  no  term  with  the  so-called 
“cosmological constant” has been added in (4) (see, e. g, [4 (§ 17.3)] for a discussion of 
that  term  in  Einstein¢ s  equations).  In  this  study  we  shall  mainly  deal  with  the  current 
density term Qij containing a charge density r 0. 
 
In  this  work  we  will  first  consider  systems  consisting  of  a  point  charge  Q  and  a 
charge  q0  =  r 0dV  (as  a  rule,  q0  <  Q)  moving  with  a  velocity  v  through  the  Coulomb 
potential  of  charge  Q.  The  gravitational  effects  of  mass  m0  associated  with  q0  will  be 
neglected,  as  well  as  the  gravitational  effects  of  mass  M  associated  with  charge  Q  in  a 
first  approximation.  The  scalar  value  of  the  radius  vector  R from charge Q to charge q0

The  following  electromagnetic  metric  written in Cartesian coordinates will be used 

will be denoted by R, whereas the position vector from charge q0 to a field point F will be 
denoted  by r. When r << R, the Coulomb potential from charge Q working on charge q0 
and  the  Newtonian  potential  from  mass  M  (if  present)  working  on  mass  m0  are  approxi-
mately constant (static) at the field point F. 
 
 
 
 
where h ij = (1, -1, -1, -1). In the applied weak field approximation the metric components 
gij are close to the Minkowski metric components h ij (so 
 
in this work (Gaussian units are chosen throughout this paper) 
 
 
 
where a  = x, y, or z and so on. Moreover, for gij we shall use the tensor components  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
where  f   =  Q/R  is  the  Coulomb  potential  from  charge  Q  working  on  charge  q0  and  Aa  
denote  the  components  of  the  electromagnetic  vector  potential A.  Potential A  may  be 
due to translation or rotation of Q (or may be due to an externally applied magnetic field). 
As  an  example,  the  dimensonless  quantity  c-2qsf   in  (7)  and  (8)  for  the  electron  in  the 
hydrogen  atom  equals  to  e2/(m0c2r0)  =  5.33x10-5  (e  is  the  charge  of  the  electron,  m0  its 
mass (here) and r0 is Bohr¢ s radius). The full metric tensor components (7)–(9) have been 
calculated  from  the  following  electromagnetic  Lagrangian  (see,  e.  g.,  [2  (p.  45)], 
Goldstein [10]) 
 
 
 
 
 
(cid:1) < m0c2, so that the approximations made in 
Note that in many cases 
(7)–(9) can be justified. Therefore, in the sequel of this work the components g0a  and g0a  
will be neglected in appropiate cases. On microscopic level, however, for example, on the 
(cid:1) and m0c2 may 
level of the substructure of the electron, where the terms 
be  comparable  in  magnitude,  the  full  expressions  (7)-(9)  may  be  required.  Note  that  no 
term  containing  electromagnetic  fields  has  been  included  in  the  right  hand  side  of  (10) 
(compare with [2 (p. 45)]). Finally, it is noticed that taking dt  = 0 for photons (as usually 
is assumed) one may deduce a light velocity v = c from (10) assuming q0 takes zero value 
for photons.

It is noticed that apart from the four equations of (15) following from (4) for i = 0 another

equations contain the velocity up to second order (product of dxi/dt and dxj/dt) instead of

contributions further.

In  (16)  and  (17)  the  approximated  right  hand  sides  correspond  to  the  approximated 
equations  (7)–(9).  At  low  velocity  and  for  a  charge  Q  =  q0  placed  in  the  field point F it 
can be seen from (7) and (8) that the Coulomb potential f  of charge Q = q0 reduces to f   = 
q0/r  and  corresponds  with  j     of  (16),  whereas  Aa   of  (8)  and  (9)  corresponds with Aa  of 
(17) under the same conditions. Thus, the seemingly arbitrary definitions for j  and Aa  in 
(16) and (17) may be chosen in such a way. It is noticed that related definitions of j  and 
Aa  have been used in the reduction of Einstein¢ s equations leading to a set of four gravito-
magnetic equations (see, e. g., [6–8]). 
Since  the  components  gii  are  approximately  constant  for  r  <<  R,  calculation  from

The quantity dt/dt  in (39) can be approximated by series expansion of (10) 
 
 
 
 
 
where the approximations  (cid:0)c-1q0 A . v (cid:1) < (cid:0)q0f
approximated equations (7) and (40) into (39) yields for v < c 
 
 
 
When  Q  is  absent,  r   of  (41)  reduces  to  expression  (1),  a  result  earlier  obtained  by 
Jefimenko  [1].  He  found  that  the  Maxwell  equations  in  which  the  rest  charge  density  r 0 
was replaced by the charge density r  of (1) remained invariant (retained their form) under 
a  special  relativistic  transformation.  For  example,  his  equation  (1)  (corresponding to our 
equation (36) with r  replaced by r 0) did not appear to be invariant under a special relati-
vistic transformation, but r  = (1 – v2/c2)-1/2r 0 did. 
 
Comparison  with  the  corresponding  Maxwell  equations  obtained  by  Landau  and 
Lifshitz [2 (§ 90)] shows, that their equations contain the rest charge density r 0 instead of 
a special relativistic charge density like r  of (1). The crucial missing factor (1 – v2/c2)-1/2 
placed me on the track in finding the equations (4). Since the equations of the authors of 
[2]  lack  this  factor,  their  derivation  does  not  seem  satisfying.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
obtained special relativistic equations (35)–(38) may be a first indication of the validity of 
the postulated equation (4). 
 
the following relation can be calculated 
 
 
 
 
 
This expression embodies the conservation law of the charge density r  given by (1).

5. Non-relativistic case 

 
At  a  non-relativistic  velocity  v  (v  <<  c)  and  in  absence  of  an  additional  charge  Q 
 
(19)  and  (20)  reduce  to  the  well  known  second  order  differential  equations  for  j   and  A 
(both  containing  the  rest  charge  density  r 0)  ,  respectively,  whereas  (18)  reduces  to  the 
familiar Lorentz condition (see, e. g., [2 (p. 158)]. In addition, in the non-relativistic case 
equations (35)–(38) reduce to the so-called vacuum Maxwell equations (In fact, Maxwell 
(1864) gave a more extended system of equations. Heaviside reformulated them in a more 
familiar  form  (see,  e.g.,  Nahin  [11]  for  a  historical  exposition).  Therefore,  we  have 
consequently  denoted  the  set  of  four  equations  as  Maxwell  equations  instead  of 
Maxwell¢ s equations). Note that in the non-relativisic case e 0 from (32) and m 0 from (33) 
reduce to unity value. From (31) then follows that in that case D coincides with E and B 
with H, respectively.

For i = 0 the conservation law of energy follows from (44) 

 
Starting  from  the metric components of (6) the conservation law of electric energy 
and the equations of motion can be calculated (see, e. g., Landau and Lifshitz [2 (§ 87)]) 
from the following full expression 
 
 
 
 
 
where ds = cdt  and dxi/ds = ui = gijuj. If appropiate expressions for the metric components 
are substituted into (43), (43) will apply both to the electromagnetic case and the gravita-
tional case. Evaluation of (43) (see, e. g., de Matos and Becker [8]) yields 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Substitution of the approximated equations (7)–(9) and (40) followed by evaluation yields 
for v < c 
 
 
 
 
 
where the conserved quantity H is the well known total electric energy of the system (see, 
e. g., [2 (p. 46)], Goldstein [10]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Substitution  of  the  approximated  equations  (7)–(9),  (16),  (17),  (27),  (28)  and  (40)  fol-
lowed by evaluation yields for v < c 
 
 
 
 
 
This  result  corresponds  to  the  usual  expression  for  the  special  relativistic  Lorentz  force 
(see, e. g., Goldstein [10]), but deviations may occur when  (cid:5)c-1q0 A . v (cid:6) @

when  v  @

mass m0. In the corresponding gravitational equations following from Einstein¢ s equations 
mass can occur without charge. Therefore, (46) and (48) might reflect that mass is a more 
fundamental quantity than charge. It is noticed that equations (46) and (48) are generally 
accepted to be valid. Thus, (46) and (48) may be a second indication of the validity of the 
postulated  equations  (4).  Moreover,  the  introduction  of  the  electromagnetic  metric  com-
ponents (7)–(9) into (43) may be justified. Components gij have, however, to be solutions

In  this  section  we  will  now  consider  systems  consisting  of  a  big  mass  M  and  a 
charge  q0  =  r 0dV  moving  with  a  velocity  v  through  the  gravitational  potential  of  M.  No 
additional  charge  Q  or  vector  potential A will be assumed to be present. In that case the 
gravitational  contributions  from  M  have to be introduced into the metric tensor (6). (The 
gravitational  effects  of  mass  m0  associated  with  q0  will  be  neglected.)  The  following 
metric may then be chosen (see, e. g., [2 (pp. 337–338 and p. 304)]) 
 
 
 
So,  all  metric  components  gij  and  gij  for  i  „
  j  are  neglected,  whereas  in  the  diagonal 
components  gii  and  gii  only  first  order  terms  in  GM/c2R  are  considered  [2 (pp. 337–338, 
see also, p. 304)]. The following non-zero tensor components gij are left 
 
 
 
 
 
where a  = x, y, or z. It is noticed that taking again dt  = 0 for photons the following light 
velocity c¢  can be deduced from (49)–(51) (compare with (2), (3) and (21)) 
 
 
 
It  is  noticed  that  both  metric  components  (7)–(9)  and  (50)–(51)  apply  to  equation 
 
(15),  the  definitions  (16)  and  (17)  and  the  relations  (18)–(31).  Utilizing  (50)  and  (51), 
evaluation of (32) and (33) yields in the gravitational case, respectively

nation  with  the  adopted  constancy  of  the  fine  structure  constant.  In  both  approaches  the 
same  velocity  of  light  c¢   of  (52)  is  obtained.  It  is  stressed  that  our  results  for  e 0  and  m 0

Note  that  in  the  presence  of  a  gravitational  field  the  charge  density  r   of  (39)  formally 
does  not  change  in  (55)  and  (56).  Series  expansion  of  dt/dt   from  (49)  approximately 
yields 
 
 
 
 
 
Using (50) and (59) r  in (55) and (56) can then approximated by 
 
 
 
 
 
Note that approximated expression of r  does not contain a first order term in GM/c2R. 
 
In  order  to  derive  equations  (55)–(58)  it  is  also  possible  to  follow  the  method  of 
Landau and Lifshitz [2 (§ 90)] and Van Bladel [3 (ch. 9)] and start from two relations in 
terms of Fij and Fij, respectively 
 
 
 
 
 
Using (25) and (26) from (61) the second pair of generalized Maxwell equations (57) and 
(58) can then be calculated. In a similar way using (29) and (30) the first pair of genera-
lized Maxwell equations (55) and (56) can be obtained from  
 
 
 
 
 
where r  has been given by the full expression of r  in (60). It is noticed, however, that in 
[2 (§ 90)] the corresponding expression for (62) and thus for (55) and (56) contain the rest 
charge density r 0 instead of generalized charge density r  of (60). 
In  addition,  for  a  plane  light  wave  the  isotropic  light  velocity  c¢   of  (52)  or  (3)  is 
 
obtained  from  (55)- (58).  From  the  general  relativistic  Maxwell  equations  given  in  [2  (§ 
90), 3 (ch. 9)] the light velocity c¢  of (2) can be deduced. The latter result also placed me 
on the track in finding equations (4). Result (2) is unsatisfactory in view of (52), which is 
compatible  with  (49)  and  with  the  observed  effects  of  the  gravitational  red-shift  and  the 
bending  of  light  in  the  presence  of  a  gravitational  field.  Therefore,  our  result  (52) 
obtained  from  (55)–(58)  may  be  regarded  as  a  third  indication  for  the  validity  of  (4). 
Moreover,  the choice of the gravitational metric components (50) and (51) applied in the 
electromagnetic case, for example, in equations (55) and (56) seems to be justified.

8. Discussion 
 

 
The new, postulated basic equations (4) containing a charge density in combination 
with  a  scalar  potential  and  vector  potential  are  the  basis  of  a  long  list  of  formulas  that 
describe  electromagnetic  phenomena.  A  number  of  examples  of  such  formulas  are: 
generalized Maxwell equations applying at relativistic velocities and in the presence of an 
additional  charge  Q  (equations  (35)–(38)),  or  an  additional  big  mass M (equations (55)–
(58))  and  the  special  relativistic  formulas  for  the  electric  energy  from  (46)  and  the 
Lorentz  force  in  (48),  respectively.  It  is  noticed,  that  the  electromagnetic  field  contri-
bution has not been included in the right hand side of (4) (see, e. g., Landau and Lifshitz 
[2  (§  33)]  for  that  contribution).  Moreover,  no  term  with  “cosmological  constant”  has 
been  added  in  (4)  (see,  e.  g,  [4  (§  17.3)]  for  a  discussion  of  the  latter  term  in Einstein¢ s

equations).  In  this  study  we  mainly  concentrated  us  on  the  current  density  term  Qij 
containing the charge density r 0. 
Einstein¢ s  gravitational  equations  contaning  a  mass  density  are  also  the  basis  of  a 
 
long  list  of  formulas  that  describe  gravitational  phenomena.  When  the  gravito-magnetic 
approach  is  followed  (see,  e.  g.,  Peng  and  Wang  [6],  Biemond  [7]  and  de  Matos  and 
Becker  [8]),  the  following  results  were  calculated  from  the  linearized  Einstein  equations: 
a  set  of  four  gravito-magnetic  equations  and  the  gravito-magnetic  force.  These  results 
may, however, be generalized in order to include a static gravitational potential. Compare 
with comment after (13) and with section 7. 
 
In addition, it has been demonstrated by Biemond [7] that in the stationary case the 
gravito-magnetic  equations  may  lead  to  a bonus: the so-called Wilson-Blackett law. This 
law  approximately  predicts  the  observed  magnetic  fields  of  rotating  bodies  ranging  from 
rotating metallic cylinders in the laboratory, moons, planets, stars, up to the Galaxy in an 
amazing way (see [7] for an extended discussion). 
 
We  now  consider  the  results  obtained  from  the  postulated  equations  (4)  more  in 
detail. At relativistic velocity and in the presence of an additional big charge Q equations 
(4) reduce to the special relativistic equations (35)–(38). In that case the vacuum permit-
tivity e 0 of (32) may deviate from unity value. When charge Q is absent, equations (35)–
(38)  reduce  to  Maxwell  equations  (see  equations  (39)–(41)),  first  obtained  by  Jefimenko 
[1].  The  latter  equations  were  found  to  be  invariant  (retained their form) under a special 
relativistic  transformation.  Moreover,  the  expected  special  relativistic  electric  energy 
from  (46)  and  Lorentz  force  in  (48)  are  found,  when  the  approximate,  electromagnetic 
metric components gij from (7)–(9) are introduced. 
 
One expects there exist generalized vacuum Maxwell equations for a charge source 
moving  at  a  relativistic  velocity  in  the  presence  of  a  static  gravitational  potential.  From 
the postulated equations (4) such a set of four differential equations (equations (55)–(58)) 
is obtained. Contrary to the result (2) of Landau and Lifshitz [2 (§ 90)] and Van Bladel [3 
(ch.  9)],  the  expected  isotropic  light  velocity  c¢   of  (52)  or  (3)  has  been  obtained  from 
these equations. Moreover, in the presence of a big additional mass M the vacuum permit-
tivity m 0 of (54) deviates from unity value. 
 
In this paper we have restricted us to the isotropic metric (49), but an exact solution 
of  Einstein¢ s  equations,  the  Schwarzschild  metric  (see,  e.  g.,  Landau  and  Lifshitz  [2,  (§ 
100)], is anisotropic 
 
 
 
So,  for  dt   =  0  an  anisotropic  velocity  of  light  follows  from  (63):  the  velocity  of  light 
perpendicular and parallel to the direction of the gravitational field equals to the result of 
(2) and (3), respectively. A more extended treatment should account for this effect. 
The  full  consequences  of  the  postulated  basic  equations  (4)  have  not  yet  been 
 
considered (mainly because first order approximations have been made in this paper), but 
they  may  become  manifest  at  a  relativistic  velocity  and  in  the  strong  electric  field  limit 
(and  in  the  strong  gravitational  field  limit).  Therefore,  equations  (4)  may  appear  to  be 
important  on  the  microscopic  level,  for  example,  on  the  level  of  the  substructure  of 
leptons  and  quarks.  Harari  [13],  e.  g.,  proposed  two  basic  building  blocks:  the  T-rishon 
with  charge  1/3  e  (e  is  charge  of  the  positron)  and  the  V-rishon  without  charge.  Thus, 
equation (41) or (1) may become manifest in the description of the interaction mechanism 
of T-rishons in the positron, for instance.

Neither  the  usual  electromagnetic  field  contribution  in  the tensor Tij has been included in 
(64)  (compare  with,  e.  g.,  Landau  and  Lifshitz  [2  (§  33)]  for  this  contribution),  nor  the 
term with “cosmological constant” (see, e. g, [4 (§ 17.3)]. As a result, the tensor Tij only 
contains  a  mass  density,  whereas  the  tensor  Qij  contains  a  charge  density,  analogous  in 
form  to  the  tensor  Tij.  The  metric  components  gij  may  contain  charge  and  mass  contri-
butions. If the term Tij may be neglected, equations (4) are left. The metric components gij 
may then contain charge or(/and) mass contributions (see sections 4 and 7). 
 
At the completion of this paper, I found a related treatment of electromagnetism in 
the  presence  of  a  gravitational  field  from  Beach  [14].  In  this work it was also suggested 
that  metric  components  may  contain  charge  sources,  but  the  charge source term was not 
isolated  from  the  electromagnetic  field  contribution  in  the  energy-momentum  tensor  Tij. 
Moreover,  no  explicit  expressions  for  gij,  electromagnetic  field  tensor  Fij,  generalized 
Maxwell equations and light velocity were given. 
Einstein¢ s equations and the new equations (4) and derived formulas form a pair of 
 
mirrors reflecting our knowledge of nature. The proposed equations (4) may fill a hole in 
existing theory. The found analogy between electromagnetic and gravitational quatities in 
(64) is striking, but incomplete. For example, the full electromagnetic metric components 
of  gij  of  (7)–(9)  are  only  partly  analogous  to  the  gravitational  metric  components  gij  of 
(50) and (51). 
Summing  up,  Einstein¢ s  equations  describing  gravitational  phenomena  are  at  the 
 
top  of  a  theoretical  mirror  that  may  be  reflected  by  another  mirror  with  at  the  top  the 
postulated  basic  equations  (4)  describing  electromagnetic  phenomena.  To  my  knowledge 
the  new,  postulated  equations  (4)  are  compatible  with  all  known  theoretical  and 
experimental  evidence.  Therefore,  presented  work  may  be  a  step  towards  further

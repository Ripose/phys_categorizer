We study the effects of higher order transversal modes in a model of a singly-

resonant OPO, using both numerical solutions and mode expansions including up

to two radial modes.  The numerical and two-mode solutions predict lower

threshold and higher conversion than the single-mode solution at negative

dispersion. Relative power in the zero order radial mode ranges from about 88% at

positive and small negative dispersion to 48% at larger negative dispersion, with

most of the higher mode content in the first mode, and less than 2% in higher

modes.

Continuous-wave operation of singly-resonant optical parametric oscillators (SRO) 

has recently been demonstrated for various non-linear materials, including KTP [1-
3] and periodically-poled LiNbO3 (PPLN) [4-6]. Significant pump depletion was 
achieved, up to 93% in [6]. In these experiments, with zero beam walk-off and 

confocal parameters of pump and signal comparable to the crystal length, 

diffractive effects are known to be important [7,8]. Theoretical studies including 

diffractive effects for cw SROs [7,8] have been published for the case of small 

pump depletion, and give the dependence of the threshold on the focusing 

geometry. A treatment of a low-loss SRO for arbitrary pump depletion in the 

plane-wave approximation was given in [9]. A numerical model including 

diffraction and pump depletion for a nano-second pulsed SRO with significant 

birefrigent walk-off was presented in [10].  To the best of our knowledge, no study 

of diffractive effects for arbitrary pump depletion in a cw SRO without beam walk-

off has been published so far.  In particular, it is not known how the transverse 

mode content of the idler beam and the amount of pump depletion depend upon 

pump power and dispersion. In this letter, we present such results for an SRO with 

low cavity losses [2]. We find that the idler beam contains higher transverse modes 

with appreciable amplitudes, and that these amplitudes depend only weakly on the 

amount of pump depletion, but strongly on the amount of dispersion.

We use the coupled wave equations for signal, idler and pump fields AF 

(F=S,I,P) in the form:

AS,z = (j/2kS)(AS,xx + AS,yy) + j k S exp(jD z)APAI* 

AI,z = (j/2kI)(AI,xx + AI,yy) + j k I exp(jD z)APAS* ,

AP,z = (j/2kP)(AP,xx + AP,yy) + j k P exp(-jD z)ASAI .

 (1.a)

 (1.b)

 (1.c)

where  k F=w F d/(nF c) and d is the effective nonlinear constant. The subscripts 

x,y and z denote partial derivatives with respect to these spatial coordinates and, 

for a periodically-poled crystal, D =kP-kS-kI - 2p /l  is the residual dispersion wave 
vector ( l  is the period of the poling). In the limit of small cavity loss  a S <<1, the 
signal field has almost constant power. For a Gaussian pump input, the lowest 

transverse signal mode has largest gain, and therefore reaches threshold first. We 

found that the threshold for the first higher radial signal mode is about four times 

higher than for the lowest mode. Our model therefore approximates the signal field 

by a Gaussian with constant power . In this case, the relationship between pump 
input power and idler output power is linear, to zeroth order in the cavity loss a S . 
From photon conservation, the first order increment in signal power is then found 

to be proportional to the idler output and hence to the pump input. Equating this to 

the round-trip cavity loss determines the pump input power as a function of signal 

power [2]. In the limit of small signal power, or small pump depletion, this gives 
the threshold pump power Pthr.

In order to understand the influence of dispersion and pump power on the mode 

content of the idler and pump, it is instructive to consider a mode expansion of the 
fields AF  into radially symmetric modes BFn [11,12]. For a zero order signal 
mode with constant coefficient, the following coupled mode equations result [12]:

AF(x,y,z) = S

daIn/dz = S

If pump, signal and idler modes have equal confocal parameter and waist 

location, the coupling coefficient cnm takes the form

Here z0 is the Raleigh range,  D

, and the coefficient d00 is independent of 
 given above is valid for z/z0 << 1. 

At threshold and with a zero order pump at input (m=0), the effect of the z-

dependent phase factor is to favor the n=0 idler mode for D
for D
idler mode (n=0) will be largest, the amplitude of the first mode (n=1) will be 

' = -3. Lowest threshold will occur for -3 < D

' < -1. The amplitude of the zero 

' = -1 and the n=1 mode 

smaller, while the amplitudes of higher modes (n>1) will be suppressed by the 

larger phase mismatch.

Above threshold, the  mode content of the idler will be modified by the higher 

pump modes (m>0) generated by pump depletion. However, since d0m=0, such 
pump modes are generated only by higher signal modes (n>0). Unless D
large negative values, these have lower amplitude. Furthermore, the coefficients  
dnm , n>0, are small. Thus, we expect the idler mode content to depend only 
weakly on the pump power.

' assumes 

Our model calculations involve a numerical integration of the coupled wave 

equations 1.b and 1.c, and of the coupled mode equations 2. The integration of 

equations 2 uses a second order Runge Kutta algorithm, for the case of zero order 

modes only (m,n=0; single mode approximation SMA) and for both the zero and 

first order radial modes (m,n=0,1; two mode approximation TMA). 

The integration of 1.b and 1.c uses a split-step algorithm, in which an explicit 

half-step of parametric conversion is followed by a full step of diffraction and 

implicit half-step of conversion. The diffraction step uses the Cayley-transform 

[13] of a discretized version of the radial Laplacian, which conserves photon 

number exactly.  The program was validated by propagating Gaussian modes 

without conversion, and beams with negligible diffraction and full conversion. 

Other numerical results were validated by reducing the radial and longitudinal 

step-sizes by a factor 0.5, giving agreement of better than 0.1% in beam 

amplitudes. 

The models refer to a traveling wave cavity, zero walk-off, equal confocal 

parameter for pump and signal, crystal length L equal to the confocal parameter b 
= 2z0 and waist locations at the center of the crystal. Wavelengths are 1.064 m m 
for the pump and 3.25 m m for the idler. Pump power P and dispersion D

 are

P = a S P0 P',

P0 = e 0 c nP nS nI c3 /( 32 p2 w S w

With this unit of power, the threshold parameter Pthr' = Pthr/(a SP0) is related to 
the threshold function  h  of [8] by:

Pthr' =0.25 (z0/L)(1+l S/l P)/h  .

For the SMA, the threshold parameter Pthr' is given in terms of the Boyd-

Kleinman gain reduction factor hm [7] as:

Pthr' = 0.5 (z0/L)(l I l S/l P

2)/hm .

Figure 1 shows the threshold parameter Pthr' as a function of the dispersion

To determine the actual threshold, the wavelength dependence of both the 
' and the resonator loss a S needs to be considered. The 

dispersion parameter D

signal wavelength will adjust to a value which gives lowest threshold Pthr= 
a SPthr'P0 . If a S is, within a certain range, independent of wavelength, minimal 
threshold occurs at a wavelength giving the optimal value of D

' = -1.30. If a S has a 

minimum at some other wave length, minimal threshold will occur at 
correspondingly different values of D

'.

Wavelength acceptance bandwidths for variations in D

' have been given in [4] 

for a PPNL crystal of length L=1cm. For the d33 coefficient and a shift in D
above and below the optimal value, the acceptance bandwidth is 7 nm. According 

' of 1.0 

to the plane-wave approximation (PWA)[9], such a shift leads to an increase in 

threshold power by a factor of 1.41. Our numerical model predicts a smaller 

increase, by a factor of about 1.20.

Figure 2 shows the maximal pump depletion as a function of dispersion. The 

SMA predicts 100% depletion at D
threshold. This is the same pump power ratio as that predicted by the PWA [9] 

'=-0.86 and a pump power of 2.47 times above 

Both the numerical model and the TMA predict maximal depletion of about 95% at 

'=-1.30 and a pump power of 2.67 above threshold. This is in good agreement 

with the experiment reported in [6], which found maximal depletion of about 93% 

between 2.6 and 3.7 times above threshold.  The optimal values of the dispersion 
parameter D
' are the same as those found for minimal threshold. As above, 
numerical model and TMA agree very well, while the SMA predicts lower 
conversion and higher pump requirements for D

'<-0.8. For a shift in D

' by 1.0 

D
below and above optimum, our numerical model predicts a reduction of maximal 

pump depletion to 81% and 75%, while the SMA gives 69% and 68%. The PWA 

gives 66% in both cases.

These reductions in threshold and increases in pump depletion, as compared to 

the PWA and SMA, are a consequence of the variable mode structure of the idler 
beam, as discussed above. As D
reduction in gain for one of the modes is partially offset by an increase in gain for 
other modes, leading to a strong dependence of the idler mode content on D

' is shifted away from the optimal value, any

mode n=0 contains 77% of the idler power, the mode n=1 contains 22%, and 
modes n>1 contain 1%. If the focal point  z=z'z0  and the Raleigh range  zI=zI'z0  
of the idler modes are adjusted, to minimize the relative power in modes n>1, such 
modes contain no more than 2% of the total power. For example, at D
modes with focus at z'=1.0 and zI'=1.0, the relative power in modes n=0,1 and n>1 
is 51%, 44% and 5%, while for the adjusted modes with focus at z'=1.04 and 
zI'=0.74, the relative power is 65%, 34% and 1%. At D
have focus at z'=1.04, Raleigh range zI'=0.94 and contain 80% for n=0, 20% for 
n=1 and less than 1% for n>1. These values are very close to the values obtained 

'=-1.3, the adjusted modes 

'=-2.3, for 

for the original set of modes..

Figure 4 finally shows the idler mode content above threshold as a function of 

pump power, for adjusted modes, at D
relative power in the mode n=1, fig. 4.b shows the relative phase of modes n=0 and 

'=-2.3, -1.3 and -0.3. Fig. 4.a shows the 

n=1 in degrees, and fig. 4.c shows the location of the mode waist. The relative 

power in the mode n=1 is seen to be almost independent of pump power, but 

depends strongly on dispersion. This strong dependence of higher mode amplitudes 

on the dispersive phase mismatch was also observed in the experimental and 

numerical studies reported in [10]. The relative phase, which determines the beam 

radius in the far-field region, vanishes at threshold and increases in absolute value 

with pump power. This leads to an increase of the far-field beam radius with pump 

power. The location of the waist shifts towards the entry face of the crystal (z'=0), 

as the pump power increases. The Raleigh range of the adjusted modes is almost 

independent of pump power, but strongly dependent upon dispersion. It ranges 
from zI'= 0.74 at threshold to 0.72 at maximal depletion for D
0.93 for D

'=-1.3 and from 1.24 to 1.26 at D

'=-2.3, from 0.94 to 

'=-0.3.

In summary, the models studied here demonstrate that the idler output of a cw, 

low loss SRO with collinear beams contains higher transverse modes with 

appreciable amplitude, with most of the higher mode content in the first radial 

mode. The mode content depends strongly on dispersion, but only weakly on pump 

power. Furthermore, the variable mode content of the idler leads to lower threshold 

and in higher conversion efficiency for larger negative values of the dispersion 
parameter D
approximations. The price paid for this is a higher content of radial modes n>0 in 

' than those predicted by the single-mode. or plane-wave 

the idler output.

Cosmological pressure fluctuations and spatial expansion

Abstract 

Most recently, experimental determinations of the spectrometric 

characteristics and internal structural velocities of galaxies have suggested the 

presence of massive central black holes. The analyses of the galactic 

spectrometric electromagnetic frequency shifts have resulted in a correlation 

between the hole mass and the surrounding bulge mass. In the present work, we 

examine whether conditions existed in the early universe, that could have led to 

the formation of gravitational structures possessing such unusual characteristics. 

We propose an early-time pressure-fluctuation model, which would have 

generated a radiation based energy distribution possessing the characteristic of a 

centrally collapsed zone isolated from its surrounding environment and thereby 

manifesting such a black hole behavior. As a hole-core expansion model, it 

exhibits a time evolving matter and radiation distribution, leading to a 

supplementary treatment of early time cosmological energy fluctuations. 

Einstein's gravitational equations are assumed to apply within the radiation-

dominated hole-core spatial domain and, with utilization of a spherically 

symmetric isotropic metric, are used in order to calculate the evolutionary time

expansion characteristics. Birth times for the radiation structures are uniquely 

correlated with the size of the spheres and are primarily determined from the early 

time energy densities and the apparent curvatures presented by the gravitational 

equations. Pressure and temperature characteristics are calculated. The hole-core 

model is described as a flat metric, matter plus radiation, σ = 1/3, energy 

distribution. It displays an early time pressure fluctuation collapse, tentatively 

interpreted to be the formation of a galaxy hole, and therein provides a theoretical 

basis for the experimental data.

INTRODUCTION 

In the early part of the century, Hubble and Humason [1] cataloged the 

recessional velocities, relative to our Milky Way galaxy, of numerous galaxies, 

thereby identifying the velocity versus distance relationship now known as the 

Hubble law. Recessional velocities were calculable from analyses of the 

spectroscopic data associated with the individual light sources while distances 

were determined from the apparent magnitudes of these sources. It is now 

believed that these optical Doppler frequency shifts arise from a cosmological 

expansion of the intervening space itself, Einstein [2], rather than from a motion 

of the galaxies through space, Silk [3], Ferris [4]. More recently the experimental 

measurements have been extended to examine the internal galactic structure with 

results that suggest the presence of a massive black hole central to most, if not all, 

observable galaxies, Kormendy [5], Magorrian [6], Kormendy [7] and Gebhardt 

[8].  

Did conditions exist in the early universe which could have led to the 

formation of gravitational structures possessing such unusual characteristics? In 

the present work, we examine an early-time pressure-fluctuation model, which 

would have generated a radiation based energy distribution possessing the 

characteristic of a centrally collapsed zone isolated from its surrounding 

environment and thereby exhibiting such a black hole behavior. To further 

D.R.Koehler

explore this description, pressure fluctuations with energy densities simulating 

experimentally observed hole and bulge masses have been investigated. The 

galaxy-core model, as developed, leads to energy densities and formation times 

when radiation was the dominant cosmological energy contributor. The birth, or 

formation, times are less than a year, even for the largest energy considered which 

was equivalent to approximately 1012 solar masses. At these early times the 

radiation energy dominates by a factor of several orders of magnitude over matter 

energy densities. Since we are considering structural birth times in the range of 

(10)-4 to (10)-1 years, cosmological expansion factors are in the range of (10)-8 to 

(10)-6 with temperatures in the range of (10)8 K and radiation densities of the 

order of (10)2 to (10)-3 grams/cm3 . 

2.  CORE AND HOLE  MODELING 

The galaxy-core model begins with an Einsteinian gravitational treatment 

of the early matter and radiation density fluctuation defining the core. Einstein's 

gravitational equations, Einstein [9], when qualified on a cosmological scale to an 

isotropic homogeneous space, have been solved by Friedmann, Einstein [9], to 

yield the classic expanding universe equations for a perfect fluid, or continuous 

matter distribution;

As a similar model for the present calculations, the galaxy-core has been 

described in evolutionary terms as a continuous matter and radiation density 

fluctuation with σ = 1/3, with a flat space metric (producing an associated radius 

dependent attraction or curvature), and beginning at time tcore-birth. This is an 

evolving spatial and matter region, which subsequently begins collapsing in the 

central core zone, a temporal diminution of the hole. However, describing this 

spherically symmetric, radial coordinate centered, pressure fluctuation region

Examining the large r behavior, we demand that the metric g44 = eν approach the

Similarly, g11 = − eμ is also set equal to −1 at large r. Since μ is μ1 + μ0∗eν/2  = μ1 

− 2∗ eν/2

, then μ1 = 2 and g11 = − e 2( 1+ x ) . 

At this juncture only the requirement of no radial energy flow and large r 

asymptotic agreement with a flat space form has been demanded. The large r 

behavior requirement is obviously applicable to the exterior solution, however the 

character of the space and radiation interior to the sphere in question is not 

dissimilar to the exterior region. The interior and exterior metrics are therefore 

considered formally equivalent with only normalization forthcoming. 

We now introduce the singular physical requirement, also posed by 

Tolman in his static description of a constant density sphere embedded in empty 

space, to uniquely describe the pressure fluctuation, namely that the pressure at 

the sphere's radius go to zero. We have then a spherical bubble of radiation 

embedded in a surrounding sea of radiation with the only characterizing 

distinction being a radial zero in the pressure distribution at the sphere radius.

This expansion rate equation is to be compared with Friedmann's cosmological 

expansion rate equation (3). From the definition of μ and x, that is, μ = 2(1 + x), 

we also see that since eμ is associated with a2, then dμ/dt = 2∗dx/dt = 2∗a-1∗da/dt

Equation (20) represents an energy balance statement in that the difference 

between the radiation and/or matter energy and the warping, or spatial curvature 

energy, goes into the energy of spatial expansion. Radiation energy density ρ(t) 

has been represented more explicitly in terms of the time evolution parameter 

given by e-4(1 + x) and subsequently, as an initial condition, will be expressed in 

terms of the present day radiation energy density, Ωr0. Initial conditions are such 

that in those regions where the curvature energy density is positive and exceeds 

the radiation energy density, then (dx/dt)2 is negative and a collapsing space 

condition will ensue. With an initially uniform radiation energy density and, as a 

result of the radial behavior of the curvature component, the region internal to the 

collapse boundary is cut off from the expanding external region since the 

temporal expansion rate, dx/dt, goes to zero at this boundary (zero propagation 

velocity). In addition, there exists throughout the immediate proximal region of 

the sphere a variable propagation velocity since the null geodesic produces a  

velocity equal to

We choose to make the hole mass and thus the hole (collapsed zone) radius an 

experimentally adjusted parameter of the model. We will, however, subsequently 

theoretically posit that the formation process is reversible, or quasi-static, and 

therefore require that, during sphere formation, the entropy change ΔS = 0. This 

requirement leads to a theoretical determination of the hole radius. 

The metrics thereby determined are displayed in Figure 2 as a function of 

the radial coordinate r. We have also included, for reference purposes, the 

Schwarzschild metric boundary values. Figure 3 illustrates the significant features 

of the propagation velocity where the asymptotic approach to c, at large r, is 

evident along with the zero at the singularity surface. Curvature, temperature and 

pressure plots are shown in Figures 4, 5 and 6. We have used a hole mass to 

sphere mass ratio of 5.2(10)-3 (mass ratio ≡ (rhole/rsphere)3; mass energy density 

equivalent to radiation energy density) in these calculations in anticipation of 

utilizing an experimentally determined quantity as an input to the model. 

Curvature exhibits a positive region, at small values of the radial coordinate, 

D.R.Koehler 

14

transitioning to a negative region and subsequently approaching zero (flat space) 

at large r. The pressure plot displays the zero introduced as a model condition at 

the sphere boundary and a singularity at the hole boundary caused by the zero 

metric normalization. Pressure inside the hole region is large and negative and at 

the hole edge approaches the singularity. Between the hole edge and the sphere 

radius, the pressure is positive and rapidly decreasing to zero at the sphere radius. 

External to the sphere, the negative pressure is small and decreases to zero at 

large radial distances. For some conditions of density and curvature, the hole 

region increases and when the hole radius approaches the sphere radius, the 

pressure singularity at the hole edge and the zero of the pressure function at the 

sphere radius merge at the sphere radius as illustrated in Fig. 7. Figure 8 shows, 

on a linear scale, the pressure factor near the zero at the sphere's radius.  

Again it is instructive to compare these results with the earlier static 

solutions. In the Schwarzschild treatment, as constructed by Tolman, of a constant 

density sphere embedded in flat empty space, the curvature energy is zero in the 

exterior region. Tolman uses the standard form of the spherically symmetric 

metric and calculates the interior solution to be

If one assumes that present day galaxy holes derive from such a collapse 

process and that the present day hole mass (neglecting accretion processes) 

represents the current collapsed radiation mass, then for the two region model, 

calculation of the bounds on the galaxy-core birth time are forthcoming from 

consideration of the galaxy-core mass radius and the hole-mass singularity-radius. 

If the initial mass distribution's maximum radius at time tcore-birth is less than or 

equal to the singularity radius for that mass, then all of the region will eventually 

collapse but the collapse process and the mass distribution itself will be 

subsequently unobservable to regions outside the singularity radius. This case 

corresponds to the density being equal to the curvature value at the sphere's edge. 

Model cases with smaller masses or earlier galaxy birth times will additionally 

contain the second, more rapidly expanding, negatively curved region. Collapse, 

as used here, describes the reduction of the time metric x2 = eν toward zero. The 

spatial metric, eμ = e2(1 + x ) , approaches e2 as x approaches zero. Therefore, for the 

region internal to the singularity surface, time tends toward zero. The hole then is 

a region of unchanging spatial character and with no time character. 

D.R.Koehler 

16

The time-bound (birth) calculation sets the collapsed mass radius, which 

equals r1 ∗ (hole mass ratio)1/3, equal to the sphere radius. This upper time bound 

is calculated to be 1.5(10)-2 years, for a galaxy-core mass of 109 stellar masses 

using equations (30) and (31) for the space expansion factor for a "radiation plus 

matter" universe and 0.52% for the hole-mass/core-mass ratio (present day mass 

density Ωs0 relates the galaxy-core radius to the galaxy-core mass). For mass and 

birth-time combinations greater than the upper extremum, the present day 

collapsed mass value would be greater than the experimental hole value referred 

to above. The calculational result for the lower time bound for the galaxy-core 

birth time (resulting for a galaxy-core mass radius that approaches a singularity 

radius equal to zero) is 2.7(10)-4 years. For cosmological times less than this 

bound, the radiation energy density exceeds the curvature energy density and the 

spheres experience no collapsing region. This dependence of birth times on 

galaxy-core mass is illustrated in Fig. 9. 

The basic physical concept of causality requires that a coherency time, or 

formation time, be imposed on the time origin of these structures. Although the 

radiation energy density can be calculated as a function of time and associated 

with the time of birth of the radiation spheres, the coherency time interval must 

additionally be imposed to determine actual birth times. Such a coherency time 

interval is expressed as 

t

D.R.Koehler

17

The coherency time interval is a measure of the time necessary to propagate 

formation information across the radial extent of the spherical radiation energy 

distribution and thereby establish equilibrium throughout. Given an instant in time 

when such structures would have been born, the coherency time interval 

determines the additional time increment to establish the starting time, or birth 

time, for subsequently calculating the evolutionary character of the radiation 

sphere. The uncertainty in expressing such a time is contained in the 

undetermined constant, ncoherency. At present no a priori deductive determination of 

this factor, however, has been forthcoming and so we proceed with the defining 

equations of the model and merely determine this constant as a companion 

calculation to be compared for reasonableness with the galaxy-core birth-time 

calculations. An interpretation of the fact that the experimental hole mass birth-

time is so near to the lower time bound birth-time (as shown in Fig. 9) is that the 

radiation spheres being thus formed require only a minimum coherency time 

interval to begin the evolutionary contraction (hole region) and expansion (outer 

shell region) process. The lower time-bound birth-time can be written as

We have made a distinction between the time of creation and the time of core-

birth, where the time of core-birth is equal to the time interval of coherency or 

formation after the time of creation. The density is changing during this time 

interval and we use the density at the core-birth time for the model calculations.

The hole mass to sphere mass ratio is an experimentally measured quantity; 

Kormendy [5], Magorrian [6], and Kormendy [7] (also see Fig. 2 in Gebhardt 

[8]). From Magorrian, log (Mhole/Mbulge) = -2.28 (mean with std.dev. = 0.51) or 

Mhole/Mbulge = 5.2×10-3. We equate our sphere mass to Mbulge. The coherency 

constant varies from approximately 0.6 to 2.2 for collapse zone radii from zero to 

r1. Objectively, these values seem reasonable, thereby supporting the core-birth 

time values as physically and calculationally defensible. 

In Fig. 11 we display the sphere density and curvature and the resultant 

velocity-factor behavior, as a function of r, while incorporating the experimental 

hole mass value in the calculations. Also shown in Fig. 12 is the character of the 

D.R.Koehler 

21

velocity-factor solution, at the birth time of the sphere, relative to the background 

radiation Hubble factor, Ho2. The velocity-factor behavior, mentioned earlier as a 

measure of the energy balance, shows a resultant overall decrease for the spatial 

expansion process in the physical vicinity of the sphere. No energy from the 

embedding space has been provided to the spheres during sphere and hole 

formation if the entropy condition is satisfied but spatial expansion has slowed.

Similarly to Figures 11 and 12, we calculate and display in Fig. 13 the results for 

the acceleration factor, d2x/dt2 + (dx/dt)2. Time rate of change of the cosmological

The x integrand and an approximating function y(x) = a/x + b are plotted in Fig. 

14. The approximation is excellent. Integration limits are indicated by x0 and end 

= (10)-6x0. In this particular example, we use the radial coordinate at r = (10)-5r1, 

the experimental hole mass and a sphere mass of (10)9 stellar masses. The energy 

density function, that is, the sum of the radiation energy density and the curvature 

energy density, is slowly varying as a function of x and therefore the x2 term 

dominates the dependence on x, thus generating the approximate logarithmic 

behavior.  

Reiterating, the cosmological density, Ωs0 and the hole mass are 

experimental parameters. For all of the calculations for Figures 4, 6-8 and 11-14, 

a galaxy-core mass = 109 stellar masses, Ωs0 = 1 and a Hubble's constant H0 = 

0.485×10-10/year (producing an age of 13.7×109 years) were used. However, if, 

from an additional theoretical perspective, the radiation sphere formation process

We have used Tolman's expression (eqn. 97.2) for the total energy of the radiation 

sphere utilizing the perfect fluid or radiation character to express T1

1, T2

2 and T3

3 

in terms of T4

4 and expressing T4

4 as the curvature energy from equation (5). The 

energy of formation, that is the curvature energy, is integrated over the entire 

spatial domain and the temperature is a function of the spatial metric e-μ/2; T = T0 

e-μ/2. A numerical integration of equation (39) yields a theoretically determined 

value for x1 and therefore rhole. The result is rhole = 0.72 r1. At this point, it should 

be noted again that the gravitating radiation sphere is a rather diffuse structure 

where there is no radiation density difference across the pressure = 0 boundary at 

r1 nor does the curvature or distortion function exhibit any discontinuity across 

this same boundary. The time evolution of the sphere, deriving from spatial 

expansion, preserves the main spatial qualities of the sphere but it is apparent that 

the comparison with the experimental hole-mass to bulge-mass ratio is somewhat 

arbitrarily defined. The ratio is calculated to vary from (0.72)3 with rsphere ≡ r1 to 

(0.72 / 6)3 = 1.7(10)-3 with rsphere ≡ 6r1 (see Fig .4 for the radial extent of the 

curvature function). Matter accretion processes occurring after sphere formation

radiation sphere itself then should be interpreted as the "hole structure". 

What is the thermodynamic distribution function describing the expected 

number of radiation spheres of a given mass, or given energy content? A 

partitioning of the total available energy with domination by the self, or rest-mass,

does not, however, seem an adequate description. The energy peak in this 

distribution occurs at Emax = 3kT. At this time, though, the desired distribution 

function has not been formulated. 

In chronological review, the presence at time tcreation of an incompletely 

formed pressure fluctuation begins the departure from relative uniformity, which 

describes the early universe. A time tcore birth is required for coherency or 

formation of the radiation spheres and is followed by both a collapsing and 

expanding time evolution of the distorted spatial region. In the present radiation, 

or perfect fluid, modeling, the description provided by equations (5) incorporates 

D.R.Koehler 

25

only the gravitational physics of the collapsing galaxy-core space; any subsequent 

matter accretion processes, or other energy sources, are not included. The 

continuous matter- but radiation-dominant-energy of the early universe, that 

constitutes the galaxy-core material, is considered the perfect fluid used to 

determine the expansion factor solution form. A present day experimental hole 

mass value, equal to 0.52% of the galaxy bulge-mass (we have associated the 

galaxy bulge-mass with our core-mass), has been used for the evolving hole 

although we have introduced an alternative theoretical entropy concept which 

constrains the determination of the hole radius. This radius is assumed to be the 

metric singularity value. The hole radius during and after the logarithmic collapse 

does not change while the time character of the hole collapses to zero. Temporal 

evolution of the galaxy-core expansion parameter, in the outer regions of the 

energy distribution, follows the negative curvature behavior and, asymptotically 

at large r, a flat (curvature = 0) behavior. Since the spatial extent of the hole 

region does not change, the galaxy-core density function in the hole region 

remains constant during the evolution. The variable Texp = Texperimental is the cosmic 

microwave background temperature and is utilized as the reference. Temperature 

is assumed to follow an a-1 or e-μ/2 behavior throughout both spatial domains. 

If we calculate the radiation energy and birth time relationship for these 

radiation spheres (see eqn.(29)) near the cosmological inflation time, we get 

approximately (10)3 equivalent grams (for the hole mass) at tcore birth = (10)-33 

D.R.Koehler 

26

seconds ( (10)-33 seconds is defined as the end of inflation ). In this calculation, 

we have used the hole mass rather than the sphere mass. The contemporary 

attempt to relate a collapsed gravitational entity to the fundamental particle 

spectrum, for example baryons, therefore is seen in the present model to lead to 

the requirement of an additional mass reduction factor (going backward in time) 

of (10)-27. Since, for these radiation spheres, the mass (from eqn. 29) is inversely 

proportional to the square root of the density and in the radiation environment we 

are considering, the density is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the 

expansion factor (inversely proportional to the second power of the time), a 

change in the expansion factor proportional to the square root of the mass factor 

achieves the desired reduction. A change of (10-27).5 = 3.2(10)-14 ( fourteen orders 

of magnitude) in the expansion factor therefore would produce the conditions for 

baryon-like radiation spheres. This puts such a proton-like particle creation-time 

during the period of cosmological inflation since the inflation period produces an 

expansion factor change of the order of thirty orders of magnitude. However if the 

release of latent energy from the phase transition of the inflation process 

maintained the energy density of the universe during the transition, then further 

expansion factor reduction would have to have occurred before inflation. For the 

time period from 10-35 to 10-43 seconds (Planck time), however, sufficient 

reduction could not have resulted. By contrast, in the rest-energy based Maxwell 

Boltzmann distribution of equation (39), distributions of radiation spheres with 

holes approximating baryon masses would peak (3kT) at a temperature of 

D.R.Koehler 

27

approximately 7.1(10)14K which occurs at about 6.6(10)-10 seconds. At the post 

inflation time of (10)-33 seconds, the temperature is 5.8(10)26K representing a peak 

sphere mass of 2.7(10)-13 grams and an associated hole mass of 1.4(10)-15 grams. 

3.  OBSERVATIONAL REDSHIFT MODELING 

For radiation emission and detection processes, photon propagation 

behavior along the time evolving emitter to observer path, is determined by the 

equation for null geodesics and integration over time along the light path. This 

leads to the expression relating the emitted and observed time intervals, Linder 

[11],

and illustrates that only the initial and final expansion states, aj(ti) (i = emitter 

time or observer time, j = emitter or observer), determine the overall resultant 

change in frequency or wavelength of the propagating radiation. In other words, 

in a non-monolithic universe where local warping is present and where radiation 

emission sources and radiation observers (detectors) are both embedded in such 

locally warped regions, calculation of the radiation modification (redshift) 

D.R.Koehler 

28

involves calculation of the local region's expansion state as manifest in the local 

expansion parameter aj(ti). The potential energy, or wavelength, diagram 

illustrated in Fig. 15 is a pictorial representation of the evolving photon energy 

state as it propagates (1), through the emitting warped galaxy region, (2), out of 

the warped interface, (3), through the spatially expanding path between emitting 

and observing galaxies, (4), into the observer space-galaxy interface, and finally, 

(5), to the detection point within the observer galaxy. The observer galaxy and the 

emitter galaxy are assumed to exhibit the same time evolutionary or expansion 

characteristics. In such a path, the wavelength stretching (photon energy loss) step 

at the emitter galaxy-space interface and the energy loss process during 

intergalactic travel is mirrored at the second observer space-galaxy interface 

where the energy loss is partially recovered and the photon wavelength decreases. 

The expanding emitter and observer galaxy regions therefore produce the net 

overall energy change, or photon wavelength increase, during the time interval 

from emission to detection. If the aemitter and aobserver evolution lines corresponded 

to the same t2/3 time behavior as aspace, then no energy loss or recovery would be 

incurred at the space-galaxy interfaces. Although the present model calculations 

are limited to the core expansion-factor time-development, the notion of local 

space warping and its impact on the propagating radiation is still appropriate. 

If the galaxy environment influences radiation redshifting, then 

microwave background radiation (CBR) is also affected and should display a

29

present-day observer galaxy-space and intergalaxy-space;

A radiation evolution and propagation diagram is shown in Fig. 16 and, as 

illustrated, suggests an actual inter-galaxy background radiation temperature 

lower (longer wavelength) than measured inside the galaxy. However, since 

aspace(today) is probably greater than that in the outer regions of the galaxy, a less-

than-one CBR offset is predicted for observers in these regions. That is, 

appropriate galaxy models, with observers in high mass-density regions, would 

predict a smaller intergalaxy CBR temperature than that which is measured, a 

phenomenon that derives from the local space warping produced by matter in the 

vicinity of the detector. The outer regions of the cores, or hole-bulge masses, 

described here display a rapidly decreasing radial warping (see Fig. 4), however, 

and, when considered as emission sources, would apparently cause measurable 

impact on galactic spectrometric electromagnetic frequency shifts only when the 

emissions emanated from regions very close to the cores. 

4.  SUMMARY 

D.R.Koehler 

30

In conclusion, we have modeled radiation generated galaxy cores, born in 

early time frames, exhibiting collapse zones with black hole type characteristics. 

The galaxy-cores, as modeled, display radius-dependent curvature, pressure and 

expansion rates and exhibit time evolution rates approaching the background t1/2 

dependencies in the outer regions while the inner regions are collapsing. We also 

postulate from this modeling that cosmological redshift data are interpretable as 

measurements of a localized galactic expansion parameter, both at the emitter and 

at the observer, and that cosmic microwave background radiation measurements 

should be impacted by the difference between galaxy and intergalaxy expansion 

rates.

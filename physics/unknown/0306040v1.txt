We have studied the spatial and temporal dynamics of a cold atom cloud 
in the conservative force field of a ferromagnetic guide, after laser cooling 
has  been  switched  off  suddenly.  We  observe  outgoing  “waves”  that 
correspond  to  caustics  of  individual  trajectories  of  trapped  atoms.  This 
provides  detailed 
the  energy 
distribution and the spin states.

The  transfer  of  cold  atoms  from  a  magneto  optical  trap  (MOT)  to  a  magnetic  trap  is  a 
crucial  step  in  most  experiments  on  Bose-Einstein  Condensation  (BEC)  in  an  atomic 
vapour [1,2].  The efficiency of this transfer has been carefully studied, and the effects of 
a  “plugging”  or  bias  field  on  the  condensation  process  have  also  been  considered  [3].  
The  plugging  field  produces  a  potential  that  is  linear  as  a  function  of  position  at  large 
distances from the center of the trap, but harmonic as a function of position for locations 
near the center of the trap. There is an intermediate region where the potential is neither 
linear nor quadratic.  In addition, as has been noted in BEC experiments, gravity can play 
an important role in the motion of the atoms in the magnetic trap [4].  The trajectories of 
the  atoms  in  the  linear  magnetic  trap  and  the  effects  of  a  plugging  field  on  those 
trajectories have not yet been considered in detail. 
 
In  this  paper,  we  demonstrate  both  theoretically  and  experimentally  that  the  non-
harmonic  nature  of  the  linear  potential  can  result  in  caustics  in  the  trajectories  of  the 
atoms where the atom densities in the trap are highly non-uniform and characterized by 
discrete ring like structures.  This is the first observation of these structures in cold atom 
trajectories,  though  they  had  been  predicted  to  occur  in  atom  lithography  experiments 
where  the  time  of  the  experiment  was  longer  than  1/4  of  the  oscillation  period 
characterizing the inner harmonic portion of the wells [5, 6].  We report on the influence 
of gravity and plugging fields for a horizontal magnetic guide and show that theory and 
experiment are in good agreement. 
 
Our experimental setup has been described elsewhere in great detail [7]. Using long mu-
metal  coils  underneath  a  gold  mirror  (Fig.  1)  we  generate  a  magnetic  field  that  can  be 
described by:  
 

                                                                                                              (1)

with  B’=dB/dr  the  magnetic  field  gradient.  In  the  absence  of  any  laser  light  but  in  the

For  typical  magnetic  field  gradients  B’  used  in  the  experiment  (25  G/cm  <  B’  <  60 
G/cm),  gravity  cannot  be  neglected  and  results  in  one  dimensional  distortion  of  the 
cylindrically symmetric potential due to the magnetic field gradient. For 87Rb, F=2, MF=2 
the effect of gravity is equivalent to a Stern-Gerlach force in a gradient B’=mRbg/µB=15 
G/cm, with g=9.81 m/s2 the gravitational acceleration and mRb the atomic mass. This is 
the minimum field gradient required to hold the atoms in the magnetic waveguide.

In our experiments we prepare 87Rb in the F=2 ground state, with a Landé factor gL=1/2 
and mF can take the values MF=-2,-1,0,1,2. Non-adiabatic transitions (between MF levels 
[8])  could  occur  in  regions  of  weak  field  (notably  the  origin  {x,y}={0,0}),  but  are 
suppressed  due  to  poor  overlap  of  the  atom  cloud  with  the  origin,  and  can  be  forcibly 
suppressed  by  applying  a  plugging  field,  which  lifts  the  magnetic  degeneracy 
everywhere.  We  shall  demonstrate  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  any  non-adiabatic 
transitions in our experiment. In the absence of a plugging field the magnetic potential is 
radially symmetric and linear: Vmagnetic(r)=MFgLµBB’ |r|. 
 
 Atoms  can  be  loaded  into  this  magnetic  waveguide  using  a  2D  surface  MOT  [7],  with 
laser beams along the x = y and x = -y directions for radial confinement and along the z-
axis for longitudinal damping. The radial confinement is well described by MOT theory 
[7]  using  σ+-σ-  polarization  for  the  counterpropagating  laser  beams.  We  find 
experimentally that any polarization can be used along the z-direction. This indicates  that 
along this axis optical molasses theory can be used. In the present experiment we use σ+-
σ+  polarization  along  the  z-axis,  providing  natural  on-axis  optical  pumping  in  cases 
where a plugging field Bz=Bplug is applied. 
 
Before  the  dissipative  light  is  turned  off,  the  atoms  are  in  a  non-conservative  quasi-
potential that is quadratic in the radial distance r (in the limit when the magneto-optical 
trapping force can be described by FMOT=-κ r, where κ is the spring constant). The MOT 
light is switched off abruptly using an acousto-optic modulator (switching time measured 
to be < 5µs), backed up by a mechanical shutter. This ensures that the atoms retain their 
velocity, but find themselves in a new conservative potential given by eq. (2). After the 
transfer to the new potential three situations may occur: (i) the average kinetic energy at 
t=0  is  much  smaller  than  the  average  potential  energy  at  t=0  (Fig  2a),  (ii)  they  are  of 
equal  order  (Fig.  2b),  or  (iii)  it  is  much  larger  (Fig  2c).  The  second  case  (ii)  has  been 
pursued  by  many  as  a  matching  (phase  space  overlap)  condition  to  effectively  transfer 
atoms  from  a  3D  MOT  to  a  3D  magnetostatic  trap,  before  engaging  in  evaporative 
cooling  to  achieve  Bose  Einstein  Condensation  [2].  Such  matching  can  be  achieved  by 
ramping up the magnetic field gradient at the same time or slightly before the MOT light 
is switched off, and depends also on the intensity and detuning of the MOT light. In our 
experiments  the  field  gradient  required  for  matching  the  size  of  the  magneto-optically 
trapped cloud with that of the magnetically trapped cloud was approximately 80 G/cm for 
87Rb or 133Cs [7].  
 
We have made a numerical analysis of the atomic trajectories in a one-dimensional (1D) 
potential analysis, as shown in Fig. 2.  From Fig. 2 it is observed that in cases (i) and (iii) 
caustics  (envelope  functions)  develop,  related  to  the  turning  points  of  individual 
trajectories with different total energies in the linear potential. These caustics result in an 
apparently  outgoing  wave  or  halo,  which  seems  to  propagate  with  near  constant  speed. 
The halo is consequence of the fact that particles catch up with one another and pass each 
other in the anharmonic potential.

An atom moving in a 1D linear confining potential is subject to a constant acceleration a, 
which changes sign as it traverses the origin. It is easy to work out that the time t for n 
oscillation periods T with amplitude A is given by:

Taking the derivative of A with respect to time t provides an approximate expression for 
the “velocity” of the caustic wavefront:

For a cloud that is initially squeezed in momentum (Fig 2a) the first caustic appears for 
n=½;  for  a  cloud  initially  squeezed  in  position  (Fig.  2c  )  it  appears  for  n=¼.  A  new 
caustic  appears  for  every  increase  of  n  by  ½.  Thus  halos  will  keep  appearing,  as  is 
observed  in  Fig  5a.  This  model  is  only  true  for  a  symmetric  linear  potential,  but  can 
easily be extended to an asymmetric potential in the presence of gravity (Fig. 4). 
 
It  is  important  to  note  that  the  caustics  are  a  consequence  of  the  anharmonicity  of  the 
potential Eq. (2). To illustrate this we have plotted the trajectories for different values of 
Bplug in Fig. 3. Increasing Bplug makes the potential more harmonic near the center of the 
potential, such that atoms with small energy oscillate with equal frequency. Furthermore 
it  is  observed  that  with  equal  initial  kinetic  energy  atoms  remain  more  confined  in  the 
linear potential when Bplug is reduced. 
 
So far we have discussed the caustics in 1D potentials. We have made a full 3D classical 
trajectory simulation to make sure the model carries over to more dimensions. Depicted 
in Fig. 6 are a numerically produced series of images, that show an initial expansion, a 
falling droplet and several halos that appear as multiple outgoing “waves” when played 
as a movie.   
 
We now turn to the experiment: after we switch off the MOT light that prepares a cold 
atom  cloud  from  the  background  vapour  (vapour  pressure  ~  10-9  mbar),  absorption 
images along the cloud are taken as shown in Figure 1, exploiting the long direction for 
large  absorption.  A  double  achromatic  lens  (f=30  cm)  with  a  diameter  of  5  cm  at  a 
distance of 60 cm from the cloud images the cloud onto a CCD camera with a resolution 
of  7  µm/pixel.  The  camera  is  shuttered  electronically  to  open  only  during  the  time  in 
which the probe beam is flashed. This exposure time was typically 80 µs for absorption 
images, but could have been reduced to 5 µs if the speed of the atom dynamics had been 
faster. 
 
Figure 7 shows a series of absorption images taken with a gradient of 24 G/cm, in steps 
of  1  ms  after  MOT  dissipation  was  switched  off.  The  initial  absorption  images  in  our

experiment suggest a density of 5x 1011 cm-3, corresponding to a maximum collision rate 
of 50 s-1, not enough to explain dynamics on the 1 ms timescale, and ruling out collisions 
playing  an  important  role.  This  figure  is  characteristic  for  the  behaviour  at  other  field 
gradients and does not change when a weak plugging field is applied. In the first 5 ms a 
rapid  expansion  can  be  observed.  This  expansion  is  due  to  the  initial  kinetic  energy  or 
due to strong-field seeking states MF=-1,-2 which are accelerated away from the center of 
the guide. We have plotted the full width half maximum (FWHM) of the cloud in these 
first  moments  in  Figure  8.  After  5  ms  we  observe  a  dense  core  with  a  maximum  size 
(FWHM) of 200 µm. Later in time the core breaks up with another core falling out and a 
halo surrounding the two cores [9].  
 
As  different  atoms  reach  their  turning  point  in  the  potential  at  different  times  an 
absorption measurement of the atomic density at those turning points could provide the 
full  energy  distribution  inside  the  magnetic  guide.  The  caustics  themselves  are  only  a 
function  of  the  field  gradient  and  will  appear  at  the  same  place  at  the  same  time 
independent of the initial temperature, thus mapping out the distribution of initial kinetic 
energy (that is: if they are visible at all, and not smeared out as in Fig. 2b). 
 
In Figure 8 we have plotted the position of the cloud that falls out versus time, as well as 
the  horizontal  width  of  the  halo  versus  time.  The  position  of  the  falling  cloud  can  be 
fitted  to  accelerated  expansion  x=½at2,  and  we  find  a=4.4  m/s2.  Clearly  these  are  not 
MF=0 atoms which would fall with a=9.8 m/s2. If we assume that these are MF=1 atoms, 
then the magnetic field gradient is 2*(9.8-4.4)/9.8 * 15 G/cm=16.5 G/cm, much different 
from the calibration result. The explanation is that we are not observing the same atoms 
falling  but  different,  bound,  MF=2  atoms  reaching  their  outer  turning  point  at  different 
times, with a caustic producing local density enhancement. From a fit of the width of the 
MF=2  caustic  we  find  a  gradient  of  27  G/cm,  which  is  within  the  experimental 
uncertainty of the calibration result. 
 
The  presence  of  multiple  halos  are  due  to  higher  order  caustics  and  we  have  observed 
them experimentally (Figs. 9 and 10).  Even a third and fourth halo have been detected, 
as can be understood from the simple model calculations in Fig 5. For the gradient chosen 
in Fig. 8, gravity cannot be neglected and provides a more significant pull on the MF=1 
atoms,  as  compared  to  MF=2.  This  causes  the  “droplet”  shape  of  the  MF=1  atoms,  as 
verified by the numerical simulation in Fig. 6, where the initial MF state can be chosen a 
priori.  
 
The  local  density  at  the  caustic  is  sufficiently  enhanced  that  we  measure  its  position 
versus time accurately. Figure 10 shows a series of measurement at different values of the 
magnetic  field  gradient.  The  diameter  of  a  caustic  ring  was  measured  in  the  horizontal 
dimension,  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  gravity.  The  caustics  appear  regularly,  e.g. 
an  atom  with  amplitude  300  µm  in  a  gradient  of  40  G/cm  reaches  its  turning  point  (as 
measured by the caustic position) first after 9 ms, then after 17 ms, and then 25 ms. This 
corresponds well to the calculated half oscillation period (Eq. 3) of T/2=9.5 ms (a=26.2 
m/s2 for a gradient of 40 G/cm). Conversely: a precise measurement of this period, which 
is not convolved by the temperature nor the initial width of the initial cloud could lead to 

 

5

a more accurate calibration of the magnetic field gradient. The data in Fig. 10, combined 
with additional data at 20 G/cm, also show that the oscillation frequency scales with the 
inverse square root of the applied field gradient.  
 
An effect that may modify the observed time dynamics are Majorana transitions. These 
are non-adiabatic transitions between MF-states, converting positive MF states (weak field 
seekers)  into  negative  MF  states  (strong  field  seekers).  In  previous  experiments  in  3D 
quadrupole  traps  Majorana  flips  were  a  serious  impediment  for  achieving  higher  phase 
space densities [1].   The transitions would occur continuously as the atoms “probe” the 
magnetic  center,  where  they  are  unable  to  adiabatically  follow  the  preferred  field 
direction.  The spin flip rate should dramatically change when a plugging field is applied, 
lifting  the  degeneracy  and  reducing  the  flip  rate.  We  have  applied  up  to  0.4  Gauss 
(corresponding to a Larmor frequency ωL>560 kHz for MF=2 atoms and ωL>260 kHz for 
MF=1,  whereas  most  trap  oscillation  frequencies  are  under  1  KHz)  and  see  no  change, 
ruling out non-adiabatic transitions. 
 
Although  the  experimental  results  are  fully  described  by  the  simple  theory  outlined 
above, we shall now discuss further refinements to the theory that may be necessary for 
higher  atomic  densities  and  smaller  temperatures,  up  into  the  quantum  degeneracy 
regime. It is instructive to use a wave mechanical picture instead of classical trajectories. 
In most general form the equation of motion of atoms in the magnetic field is given by a 
non-linear  Schrödinger  equation  (Gross-Pitaevski  approximation)  for  an  F=2  spinor, 
consisting of 5 MF states:

 The first and second term on the left hand side of this equation are diagonal and describe 
kinetic  and  gravitational  energy  respectively.  The  other  terms  may  provide  coupling 
between the sublevels: the part with the five-by-five spin matrices Jx, Jy and Jz describes 
the  Zeeman  interaction  and  the  last  term  describes  non-linear  interaction  due  to 
collisions, in the mean field approximation characterized by a coupling strength gkl, with 
indices  k  and  l  denoting  the  MF  state.  As  we  have  outlined  before  there  is  no  coupling 
observed in the experiment, rendering system (5) into a set of 5 independent and linear 
Schrödinger  equations.  However  the  study  of  spinor  dynamics  is  an  area  of  active 
theoretical [10-14] and experimental [15] research, and is relevant for future applications 
of  the  magnetic  waveguide  described  in  this  paper.  Very  recently  the  F=1  spinor 
equivalent  of  equation  5  has  been  solved  in  the  presence  of  a  Ioffe-Pritchard  magnetic 
field [27].  
 
 In Figure 5 we have plotted the solution of the 1D Schrödinger equation for the MF=2 
state in the combined magnetic and gravitational potentials (2), together with the classical

trajectories  picture.  Clearly  the  caustics  are  observed  in  the  wave  mechanical  model  as 
well: regions of increased probability for the quantum wavefunction. Correspondence of 
the two models has been noted by [16] and coined the term ‘quantum carpets’ by [17, 18] 
when these regions of enhanced probability are due to mode interference. The situation 
described in this paper can be understood completely classically and it is not necessary to 
invoke quantum interference.  
 
For our geometry with a potential V(r)=F|r|  the density of states is given by [19]:

Integrating  this  over  the  energy  range  observed  in  the  experiment,  we  find  that  ~106  
modes  are  populated,  enough  to  find  perfect  agreement  between  classical  and  quantum 
dynamics.  For lesser modes significant deviations can be found as pointed out by Gea-
Banacloche  [20],  who  examined  a  quantum  bouncing  ball  in  a  gravitational  field  en 
Wallis  and  coworkers[21],  who  investigated  a  gravitational  cavity.  Individual  modes, 
trapped in a linear potential provided by gravity, have been observed with neutrons [22].  
 
 Finally  we  discuss  a  diffraction  experiment  to  measure  the  initial  size  σx  of  the  cloud, 
which is not revealed in the previous absorption data of Fig. 7: the optical density OD// 
along the cloud is too large: OD//=100 for t=0. Thus an absorption measurement with a 
resonant probe beam as depicted in Fig. 1 is fully absorbed in the center, resulting in an 
clipped  profile.  We  have  imaged  the  cloud  from  the  transverse  side  (Figure  11),  where 
the  optical  density  OD^  is  much  less  [23].  Using  the  same  magnification  we  observe  a 
different profile in absorption and fluorescence. The imaging lenses are focused using the 
fluorescence signal, and their position is not changed when absorption images are taken. 
There  is  a  clear  difference  between  2f:2f  absorption  imaging  (with  one  lens)  and  f:2f:f 
absorption imaging (with two equal lenses), due to the phase coherence of the probe light. 
Only in the latter case the phase plane of the incident probe beam is reconstructed in the 
image plane, resulting in a crisper image. 
 
Probe light diffraction and refraction by the long and narrow cloud is not negligible, and 
even  plays  a  role  in  the  transverse  direction.  The  cloud  can  be  described  as  a  medium 
with a complex index of refraction [24,25]:

where λ, δ and Γ are the wavelength of the probe light, the detuning and the linewidth of 
the atomic transition respectively. The imaginary part n” gives rise to absorption, the real 
part n’ gives rise to phase shift of order Φ=OD^ |n’-1|/λ. The index of refraction varies 
strongly near resonance, and therefore absorption near resonance does not provide a good 
measurement of the size of the cloud. From the fluorescence however we find a sharply

distribution, but its integral along the line of sight. To study further the phenomenon of 
refraction by the cloud we took out the imaging lenses and detuned the probe laser. The 
far field pattern at distance R was recorded on the CCD camera, with results plotted in 
Fig. 12. The observed intensity pattern has been fitted to:

where R=50 cm is the imaging distance (distance between the cloud and the camera) and 
is inversely 
Rp the radius of curvature of the probe laser. The “envelope” function 
proportional to the original cloud width, and is related to the fact that at infinite distance 
the Kirchhoff diffraction integral equals a Fourier transform of the spatial distibution in 
the  object  plane.  For  our  purpose  we  have  fitted  an  envelope  function  exp(-ρ2/σρ
2)  for 
which we find σρ= 2.5 mm, corresponding to a scale size σx=Rλ/σρ=150 µm of the cold 
atom cloud. However, the observed radial distribution is distinctively non-Gaussian and 
presents a subject for future investigation. The fitted values for the phase shift are φ0= -
0.4,-1.5 and –2.0 rad for δ=0, -Γ, -2Γ respectively, which confirms that the atomic cloud 
has OD^ ~1.  
 
In conclusion we have presented experiments and numerical simulations to examine the 
spatial and temporal dynamics of atoms in the linear potential of a magnetic waveguide. 
This provided detailed information on the magnetic field, the energy distribution and the 
spin  states,  which  can  be  used  for  future  applications  such  as  multimode  atom 
interferometry using ferromagnetic guides. In-situ loading of a magnetic waveguide has 
also been proposed as a mechanism to seed a continuous atom laser [26]. In that case the 
“mapping”  from  the  dissipative  system  to  the  conservative  potential  is  provided  by  an 
optical  pumping  mechanism  rather  than  switching  in  time,  but  we  expect  similar 
dynamics as described in this paper.

Chikkatur et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 483 (2000). These authors  describe how a Bose 
condensate falling due to gravity generates an s-wave collisional halo when the 
condensate velocity relative to impurities is larger than the superfluid velocity. The halo 
in this work is due to an entirely different effect.

Fig  1:  Experimental  setup:  a  laser  cooled  87Rb  cloud  (length  ~5  mm)  is  prepared  at  a 
height of 3 mm above a gold mirror using a surface magneto-optical trapping technique. 
After  switching  off  the  trapping  laser  beams  (not  shown),  an  absorption  image  (2f:2f 
imaging  with  focal  length  f=30  cm)  is  taken  in  the  long  direction  of  the  cloud  using  a 
probe laser beam with a waist of 1 cm.

Figure 2: Manifold of 120 trajectories in a linear 1D confining potential (magnetic field 
gradient  38  G/cm,  no  gravity)  for  different  conditions  of  the  initial  position  and 
momentum distributions. Top: squeezed in momentum: σv=6 mm/s, σx=100 µm, middle: 
not-squeezed:  σv=4  cm/s,  σx=100  µm,  bottom:  squeezed  in  position  σv=4  cm/s, 
σx=10µm. Caustics are clearly visible in the top and bottom graphs, and correspond to the 
turning  point  of  individual  trajectories.  The  term  ‘squeezing’  refers  to  matching  of  the 
relevant energy scales before and after transfer to the conservative potential (see text).

corresponding 1D potential with dB/dr=38 G/cm and Bplug=3.8, 0.8 and 0.2 G from top to 
bottom. Note that with the same initial kinetic energy (σv=4 cm/s) the cloud occupies a 
much greater space for a (nearly) harmonic potential.

Figure 4: Including the effect of gravity, which corresponds to an extra vertical magnetic 
gradient of 15 G/cm, in addition to the gradient of 38 G/cm. Same parameters as Figure 
3. Note that the potential minimum is no longer at the magnetic centre, and shifts more 
for larger Bplug. Caustics with different slope can still be observed for a linear potential.

and  σv=7  mm/s.  The  atoms  are  unbound  in  the  long  direction  of  the  waveguide.  The 
bottom “droplet” are the MF=1 atoms. Grayscale (inverted) indicates number of atoms in 
a 10 µm x 10 µm bin. Frame size: 1.5 mm x 1.5 mm.

Figure 9: Time evolution of the cold atom cloud (gradient 30 G/cm). Frame size 2.8 mm 
x 3.5 mm. Same situation in Fig. 7, but we start at t=15 ms, with time steps of 1 ms. An 
outgoing caustic for mF=2 atoms has emerged at t=15 ms, followed by another starting at 
t~23  ms.  The  scarcely  visible  “droplet”  at  the  bottom  corresponds  to  the  more  weakly 
confined MF=1 atoms.

which they first appear) may be visible at the same time, since the oscillation frequency is 
a function of amplitude for an anharmonic potential.

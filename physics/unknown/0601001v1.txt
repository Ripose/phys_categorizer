We  have  observed  the  compensation  of  loss  in  metal  by  gain  in  interfacing  dielectric  in  the
mixture  of  aggregated  silver  nanoparticles  and  rhodamine  6G  dye.  The  demonstrated  six-fold
enhancement of the Rayleigh scattering is the evidence of the increase of the quality factor of the
surface plasmon (SP) resonance. The reported experimental observation paves the road to many
practical applications of nanoplasmonics. We have also predicted and experimentally observed a
suppression of the surface SP resonance in metallic nanoparticles embedded in a dielectric host
with absorption.

Localized surface plasmon (SP) is an oscillation of free
electrons  in  a  metallic  particle,  whose  resonance
frequency is the plasma frequency adjusted by the size
and,  mainly,  the  shape  of  the  particle.  A  phenomenon
relevant to localized SPs is a surface plasmon polariton
(SPP)  or  a  surface  electromagnetic  wave  propagating
along  the  interface  between  two  media  possessing
permittivities  with  opposite  signs,  such  as  metal-
dielectric interface.

Localized  plasmons  have  been  found  on  rough
surfaces  [1,2],  in  engineered  nanostructures  [3-6],  as
well  as  in  clusters  and  aggregates  of  nanoparticles  [7-
9].  In  the  spots  where  local  fields  are  concentrated,
both  linear  and  nonlinear  optical  responses  of
molecules  and  atoms  are  gigantically  enhanced.  This
leads  to  a  number  of  important  applications,  the  most
matured  of  which  is  the  Surface  Enhanced  Raman
Scattering (SERS) [2]. A number of interesting optical
phenomena (such as harmonic generation, SERS, Kerr
effect,  etc.)  caused  by  dramatic  field  enhancement  in
hot  spots  of  fractal  aggregates of silver nanoparticles
have  been  theoretically  predicted  and  experimentally
demonstrated  by  Shalaev  and  coauthors  [10].  Other
applications  of  resonating  metallic  nanostructures  and
related  phenomena,  described  by  the  common  name
€ 
nanoplasmonics,  include  near-field  microscopy  [11-
13], extraordinary transmission of light through arrays
of subwavelength holes in metallic films [14], negative
index metamaterials [15,16], etc.

Most of existing and potential future applications of
nanoplasmonics  suffer  from  damping  caused  by  metal
absorption.  In  1989  Sudarkin  and  Demkovich
suggested to increase the propagation length of SPP by
creating  the  population  inversion  in  the  dielectric
€ 
medium  adjacent  to  the  metallic  film  [17].  Recently,
€ 

gain-assisted  propagation  of  SPPs  at  the  interface
between  metal  and  a  dielectric  with  optical  gain  has
been  analyzed  theoretically  in  Refs.  [18,19].  The
enhancement  of  SPP  (of  the  order  of  10-5–10-4)  at  the
interface  between  silver  film  and  dielectric  medium
with  optical  gain  (laser  dye)  has  been  recently
demonstrated in Ref. [20].

€ 

In  a  similar  way,  the  localized  SP  resonance  in
metallic  nanospheres  was  predicted  to  exhibit  a
singularity when the surrounding dielectric medium has
a  critical  value  of  optical  gain  [21].  This  singularity,
resulting from canceling both real and imaginary terms
in the denominator of the field enhancement factor in a
metallic  particle 
evidenced  by  an  increase  of  the  Rayleigh  scattering
[21] (here εd and εm are complex dielectric constants of
dielectric and metal, respectively).

Let  us  estimate  critical  gain  needed  to  compensate
metal loss of localized SPs. The polarizability (per unit
volume) for isolated metallic nanoparticles is given by
β = (4π)−1[εm −εd ] /[εd + p(εm −εd )], where  p is the
depolarization  factor  (for  a  sphere, p=1/3)  [10].  If  the
" /(1− p) ,
dielectric is an active medium with 
then at the resonance both the real and imaginary parts
in the denominator become zero, leading to extremely
large  local  fields  limited  only  by  saturation  effects

[21,22].  Thus,  for  the  gain  coefficient  needed  to

The  gain γ~1 02–103  cm-1  needed  to  compensate
loss  of  SPP  or  localized  SP  is  within  the  limits  of
semiconducting  polymers  [24]  or  laser  dyes  (highly
concentrated, ~10-2  M  [21],  or  adsorbed  onto  metallic
nanoparticles). In aggregates of metallic nanoparticles,
critical gain can be even smaller (up to ten times) than
in single nanoparticles because of small effective form
factors p  of  chains  of  nanospheres  contributing  to  the
spectrum of the aggregate at the given wavelength [25].
Using  the  same  line  of  arguments  as  was  used  in
Ref.  [21],  one  can  infer  that  by  embedding  metallic
nanoparticle  in  a  dielectric  medium  with  absorption,
one  can  further  increase  the  imaginary  part  of  the

The  objective  of  this  work  was  to  demonstrate
experimentally both predicted effects, the enhancement
of  the  SP  by  gain  and  its  suppression  by  loss  in  a
dielectric medium.

Experimentally,  we  studied  absorption,  emission,
and  Rayleigh  scattering  in  the  mixtures  of  R6G  dye
(Rhodamine 590 Chloride from Exciton) and aggregate
of  Ag  nanoparticles.  The  starting  solutions  of  R6G  in
methanol  had  concentrations  of  dye  molecules  in  the
range  1x 10-6-2.1x10-4M.  Poly(vinylpyrrolidone)-
passivated  silver  aggregate  suspended  in  ethanol  was
prepared  according  to  the  procedure  described  in  Ref.
[24].  The  estimated  concentration  of  Ag  nanoparticles
in the aggregate was 8.8x1013  cm-3. In some particular
experiments, we diluted Ag aggregate before mixing it
with dye.

The  absorption  spectrum  of  Ag  aggregate  had  one
structureless band covering the whole visible range and
extending to near-infrared (Fig. 1, trace 8). The major
feature in the absorption spectrum of R6G is the band
peaking at ≈528  nm (Fig. 1a, trace 1 and inset of Fig.
1a).  Experimentally,  we  added  Ag  aggregate  solution
to  the  dye  solution  by  small  amounts  and  recorded
absorption spectra of the mixtures (Fig. 1a, traces 2-7).
(In  different  particular  experiments,  the  ‘step’  size
varied  between  1%  and  25%  of  the  maximal  Ag
concentration.) We then scaled the absorption spectrum
of  pure  Ag  aggregate  to  fit  each  of  the  spectra  of  the
mixtures  at  ≤450  nm  and  calculated  the  difference
spectra  {mixture–aggregate}.  The  differential  spectra
obtained  this  way,  normalized  to  the  concentration  of
the  R6G  dye  in  the  mixture,  reveal  the  regular
absorption band of R6G dye, at ~0.53 µm, and a much
broader new absorption band centered at 0.72-0.75 µm
(Fig.  1b).  The  latter  broad  band  can  be  due  to  hybrid
states formed by R6G molecules chemisorbed (via Cl-)
onto silver nanoparticles [27] or due to restructuring of
the Ag aggregate in the presence of dye molecules.

As  one  can  see  in  Fig.  1b,  with  the  increase  of  Ag
aggregate in the mixture, the intensity of the absorption
band of R6G (calculated using the procedure described
above)  decreased,  with  the  rate  exceeding  the  rate  of
the reduction of the R6G concentration. (According to
our previous study [28], the observed reduction of the
R6G  absorption  is  due  to  Ag  aggregate  but  not  an
aggregate solvent without Ag.)

similar numbers in Figure a. Inset: Enlarged fragment of the main

Spontaneous  emission  spectra  were  studied  in  the
setup schematically shown in the inset of Fig. 2, when
the  dye  or  a  mixture  of  dye  with  Ag  aggregate  was
placed  in  a  1  mm  cuvette.  The  samples  were  pumped
and the luminescence was collected nearly normally to
the  surface  of  the  cuvette.  We  found  that  while  the
shape of the emission band was practically unaffected
by  the  presence  of  Ag  aggregate  in  the  mixture,  its
intensity  changed  significantly.  At  the  starting
concentrations  of  R6G  and  Ag  aggregate,  equal  to

2

R6G=1.25x10-5  M,  Ag=8.7x1012  cm-3,  the  emission
intensity of the dye (measured in the maximum at ~558
nm)  increased  up  to  21%  at  the  addition  of  small
amounts of aggregated silver nanoparticles (Fig. 2). At
the  further  increase  of  the  concentration  of  Ag
aggregate  in  the  mixture,  the  emission  intensity
decreased.  However,  its  relative  decrease  was  much
smaller  than  the  relative  reduction  of  the  R6G
absorption determined as it was described above.

speculate  that  the  absorption  band  of  R6G  “burns”  a
hole in the absorption spectrum of the aggregate in the
frequency  range  corresponding  to  the  absorption  of
dye.  Thus,  the  conventional  method  that  we  used  to
extract the absorption band of R6G from the absorption
spectrum  of  the  mixture  was  not  applicable  to  our
system. Instead, the absorption spectrum of the mixture
should  be  decomposed  according  to  the  method
schematically  shown  in  Fig.  3.  This  explanation
supports  our  hypothesis  (suppression  of  SP  resonance
by  loss  in  dielectric)  and  resolves  the  paradox  above
(an increase of emission intensity at seeming reduction
of R6G absorption).

Fig.  2.  Emission  intensity  recorded  at  the  addition  of  the  Ag
aggregate to the R6G dye. The starting concentrations of R6G and
Ag aggregate are, respectively, 1.25x10-5 M and 8.7x1012 cm-3 The
emission  intensity  corresponds  to  “as  is”  detected  signal  that  has
not  been  a  subject  to  any  normalization.  Inset:  Schematic  of  the
experimental setup used at the emission intensity measurement.

According  to  Refs.  [29,30],  the  quantum  yield  of
spontaneous emission of low concentrated R6G dye is
equal  to  95%.  Thus,  the  experimentally  observed
emission enhancement cannot be due to the increase of
the quantum yield. An enhancement of emission can be
explained  by  increased  absorption  of  R6G  in  the
presence of Ag aggregate. However, at the first glance,
this  explanation  contradicts  with  the  experimental
observation: seeming reduction of the R6G absorption
with  the  increase  of  Ag  aggregate  concentration,  inset
of Fig. 1b.

We argue that the commonly accepted procedure of
the  decomposition  of  an  absorption  spectrum  into  its
components,  which  we  used  to  treat  data  of  Fig.  1,  is
not  applicable  to  the  mixture  of  two  substances  (dye
and  aggregated  metallic  nanoparticles)  which  affect
each  other,  and  that  the  paradox  above  has  a  clear
physical explanation.

The  absorption  spectrum  of  a  fractal  aggregate  is
comprised  of  a  continuum  of  homogenious  bands
corresponding to metallic nanostructures with different
effective  form  factors.  (The  homogeneous  widths  of
individual  bands  are  comparable  to  the  characteristic
widths  of  the  absorption  and  emission  bands  of  R6G
dye.)  Following  our  prediction  of  the  suppression  of
the SP resonance by the absorption in a dielectric, we

Fig.  3.  Schematic  of  the  proposed  decomposition  of  the
absorption spectrum of the mixture into the absorption spectra
of the components.

As  it  has  been  estimated  above,  the  critical  gain
needed to compensate loss in metallic nanoparticles is
of  the  order  of  103  cm-1.  Obviously,  the  effective
absorption  coefficient  of  the  same  order  of  magnitude
can  cause  a  significant  suppression  of  the  SP
resonance.  One  can  estimate  that  a  single  molecule  of
R6G  (characterized  by  the  emission  cross  section  ~
4x10-16  cm2)  adsorbed  onto  metallic  nanoparticle  with
the diameter d=10 nm causes the absorption coefficient
(per  the  volume  occupied  by  the  nanoparticle)  of  the
order  of  103  cm-1.  Correspondingly,  the  same  excited
molecule can cause a critical gain of the same order of
magnitude.  If  the  number  of  adsorbed  R6G  molecules
per  nanoparticle  exceeds  one,  the  effective  absorption
and gain can be even higher.

Following  Lawandy  [21],  we  used  an  increase  of
Rayleigh scattering in a pump-probe experiment as an
evidence of enhancement of SP by optical gain.

R6G-Ag  aggregate  mixtures  (similar  to  those  used
in  the  absorption  measurements)  were  pumped  with  a
frequency-doubled  Q-switched  Nd:YAG 
laser,

beam  was  split  off  and  used  to  pump  a  simple  laser

two  mirrors,  inset  of  Fig.  4.  Since  no  wavelength
selection  element  was  used  in  the  laser  cavity,  the
emission line of the R6G laser (~558 nm) corresponded
to  the  maximum  of  the  gain  spectrum  of  R6G  dye  in
the  mixtures  studied.  The  beam  of  the  R6G  laser,
which  was  used  as  a  probe  in  the  Rayleigh scattering,

not  notice  that  the  results  of  the  SP  enhancement
measurement  depended  on  the  detection  angle.)  The
fiber collected scattered probe light as well as scattered
pumping  light  and  spontaneous  emission  of  dye.  To

separate  the  scattered  probe  light,  we  used  a
monochromator  and  ran  the  emission  spectrum  from
540 nm to 650 nm. The scattered probe light was seen
in the spectrum as a relatively narrow (~5 nm) line on
the top of a much broader spontaneous emission band.

Experimentally,  we  kept  the  energy  of  the  probe
light  constant  and  measured  the  intensity  of  the
scattered  probe  light  as  the  function  of  the  varied
pumping  light  energy.  The  six-fold  increase  of  the
Rayleigh  scattering  observed  in  the  dye-Ag  aggregate
mixture with the increase of the pumping energy (Fig.
4a, squares) is the clear experimental demonstration of
the compensation of loss in metal and enhancement of
the quality factor of SP resonance by the optical gain in
surrounding dielectric.

The  dye-Ag  aggregate  mixtures  were  placed  in  1
mm  thick  cuvettes.  At  the  dye  concentration  2.1x10-5
M, which we used in the majority of our experiments,
the maximal optical amplification at 1 mm length was
equal  to  ~7%.  (The  lateral  dimension  of  the  pumped
volume was smaller than 1 mm.) The dye-Ag aggregate
mixtures  were  visually  clear,  with  the  transport  mean
free path of the order of centimeters. Correspondingly,
the  probability  of  elongation  of  photon  path  in  the
pumped  volume  due  to  scattering  was  insignificantly
small.  Thus,  we  conclude  that  an  increase  of  the
intensity of scattered light in our experiment was due to
an  enhancement  of  the  Rayleigh  scattering  cross
section  of  metallic  particles  rather  than  simple
amplification of scattered light in a medium with gain.
Experimentally,  no  noticeable  enhancement  of
scattering  was  observed  in  the  pure  R6G  dye  solution
or pure Ag aggregate suspension.

We have found that depending on the shape of the
absorption  spectrum  of  the  Ag  aggregate-dye  mixture
(Fig. 4b) the intensity of the Rayleigh scattering could
increase or decrease with the increase of pumping (Fig.
4a). Inset of Fig. 4b shows a monotonic dependence of
the  scattering  enhancement  measured  at  0.46  mJ
pumping  energy  versus  the  ratio  of  the  absorption
coefficients of the mixture at 570 and 400 nm. One can
see that the relatively strong absorption of the mixture
at  570  nm,  which  is  a  signature  of  aggregated  Ag
nanoparticles,  helps  to  observe  an  enhanced  Rayleigh
scattering. Although we do not precisely understand the
relationship  between  the  absorption  spectra  and  the
physical  properties  of  the  mixtures,  which  govern  the
results  of  the  scattering  experiments,  the  correlation
exists with no doubts.

A  possible  explanation  for  different  scattering
properties  of  different  mixtures  could  be  in  line  with
the theoretical model developed in recent Ref. [31], in
which  a  three-component  system  consisting  of  (i)
metallic  nanoparticle,  (ii)  shell  of  adsorbed  onto  it
molecules  with  optical  gain,  and  (iii)  surrounding
dielectric  (solvent)  has  been  studied.  In  particular,  it

has been shown that depending on the thickness of the
layer  of  an  amplifying  shell,  the  absorption  of  the
complex can increase or  decrease with  the increase of
the gain in dye [31]. Similarly, we can speculate that in
our experiments, in different mixtures we had different
numbers  of  adsorbed  molecules  per  metallic
nanoparticle, which determined the enhancement or the
suppression of the Rayleigh scattering.

The  detailed  study,  which  is  outside  the  scope  of
this  work,  is  required  to  determine  the  correlation
between  the  degree  of  agglomeration  of  R6G
molecules  and  Au  nanoparticles  and  the  absorption
spectra of the mixtures. We also do not discuss in this
Letter a possible relation between the compensation of
SP  loss  by  optical  gain  in  dielectric  and  recently
proposed  surface plasmon  amplification  by  stimulated
emission of radiation (SPASER) [32], which would be
a subject of separate investigation.

To  summarize,  we  proposed  the  possibility  of
suppression  of  the  surface  resonance  in  metallic
nanostructure  embedded  in  a  dielectric  medium  with
absorption, the phenomenon, which is a counterpart of
the  enhancement  of  SP  resonance  in  metallic
nanoparticles  submersed  in  a  dielectric  with  optical
gain [21]. We have observed both effects, enhancement
and suppression of the SP resonance, in the mixtures of
Ag aggregates and R6G dye. The demonstrated six-fold
enhancement of the quality factor of the SP resonance
paves  the  road  for  numerous  applications  of
nanoplasmonics,  which  currently  suffer  from  strong
damping caused by absorption loss in metal.

This  work  was  supported  by  the  NASA  grant  NCC-3-
1035 and the NSF grant HRD-0317722. The authors cordially
thank  Thomas  Klar  for  reviewing  the  manuscript  and
discussing the results.

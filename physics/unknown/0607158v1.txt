Abstract.  The  properties  of  suspensions  of  fine  particles  in  dielectric  liquid  (electrorheological 
fluids) subjected to an electric field lead to a drastic change of the apparent viscosity of the fluid. 
For  high  applied  fields  (~  3-5  kV/mm)  the  suspension  congeals  to  a  solid  gel  (particles  fibrillate 
span  the  electrode  gap)  having  a  finite  yield  stress.  For  moderate  fields  the  viscosity  of  the 
suspension is continuously controlled by the electric field strength. We have proposed that in DC 
voltage the field distribution in the solid (particles) and liquid phases of the suspension and so the 
attractive induced forces between particles and the yield stress of the suspension are controlled by 
the conductivities of the both materials. In this paper we report investigation and results obtained 
with  nanoelectrorheological  suspensions:  synthesis  of  coated  nanoparticles  (size  ~  50  to  600  nm, 
materials  Gd2O3:Tb,  SiOx…),  preparation  of  ER  fluids  (nanoparticles  mixed  in  silicone  oil), 
electrical and rheological characterization of the ER fluids. We also propose a possible explanation 
of  the  enhanced  ER  effect  (giant  ER  fluids)  taking  into  account  the  combined  effects  of  the 
(nano)size  of  the  particles,  the  Van  der  Waals  forces  between  particles  in  contact  and  the 
electrostatic pressure in a very thin layer of insulating liquid. 

Introduction 

Electrorheological Fluids. Electrorheological (ER) fluids are concentrated suspensions of small 
solid particles in a dielectric liquid. These fluids are all distinguished by the ability to control or to 
stop  their  flow  when  an  electric  field  (~1-5  kV/mm)  is  applied.  This  change  of  the  rheological 
properties  of  the  fluids  is  due  to  the  fibres  formation  in  the  direction  of  the  electric  field.  Those 
fibres  appear  within  a  few  milliseconds.  A  few  minutes  later,  the  fibres  gather  to  form  thick 
columns. Moreover, the effect is totally reversible: when the field is turn off, the ER fluids return to 
liquid state.  

ER fluids have been discovered in 1947 by W. M. Winslow [1,2]. They caused a great interest as 
they  offered  numerous  applications  in  various  domains  (dampers,  clutches,  valves,  actuators, 
artificial members…) with many advantages (speed, low electric consumption, simplicity…). 

 
Characterization. The characterization of an ER fluid is represented by a graphic showing the 
shear stress τ as a function of the shear rate γ& . Fig. 3 presents a schematic characterization of an ER 
fluid.  

Under electric field, we can distinguish two states:  a solid state and  a liquid  one. That kind of 
behaviour can be adequately describes as Bingham bodies that also have a threshold (yield stress) 
upon which the liquid flows.

The strength (or the quality) of an ER fluid can be evaluated by the value of its static yield stress 
τs  which  corresponds  to  the  maximum  force  the  ER  fluid  can  handle  before  it  breaks  (Fig.  1(e)). 
Common ER fluids have a static yield stress about 5-8 kPa which is not sufficient for the majority 
of applications.

and the effect of the applied electric field E on the yield stress τs 

 

The giant ER effect. Recently Wen et al announced [3] the synthesis of a new ER fluid which 
reach  a  yield  stress  of  130  kPa  (20  times  higher  than  traditional  ER  fluids)  and  all  applications 
quoted above appears now to be realizable. This modified the situation to a significant extent of the 
interest of these fluids.  

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 

 
 

The  main  difference  between  their  giant  ER  fluid  and  the  common  fluids  is  the  size  of  the 
particles. Whereas classical fluids were used to be synthesize with micro-sized particles, Wen et 
al used nano-sized particles of BaTi03 (diameter 50 nm) coated with urea (10 nm thick).  

Tested fluids. The yield stress of various fluids have been measured 
with a cylindrical rheometer (rheomat 115A) while the current density 
values were collected with a pico-ammeter (Fig. 4).  

Fig.  5(a),(b)  present  measurements  of  ER  fluids  which  consists  of 
nano-sized  SiOx  particles  functionalized  on  the  surface  with  40%  of 
amine groups and 60% of hydroxyl groups and dispersed in silicon oil 
(Wacker AS 4). Fig. 5(c) shows data from a dispersion of SiOx particles 
in silicon oil. All fluids possess a volume fraction approximately equal 
to 15%. Measures were made at room temperature. 

According to those data, the smaller the particles are, the higher the 
yield  stress  is  (Fig.  5(a),  (c)).  In  the  same  time,  the  current  increases 
with the yield stress stress (Fig. 5(b)), which is in good agreement with 
the conduction model (see the next paragraph).

polarization  model  introduces  the  permittivities  of  the  different  phases  as  the  main  parameters 
(εsolid>εliquid). In the case of the conduction model, the difference of the conductivities between the 
solid and the liquid are used. Theory and experience give the following conditions for a fluid to be 
electrorheological: (102 to 103)σL ≤ σS ≤ 10-7-10-5 S/m [4,5].  

According  to  the  data  given  by  Wen  et  al  [3],  it  is  rather  the  conduction  model  that  seems  to 
describe partly the giant ER effect. Indeed, as we will see later in this paper, the conduction model 
leads to a linear variation of the force on the electric field and the experimental study of their giant 
ER fluid show also a quasi-linear law τ(E). 

The conduction model. The conduction model appeared in 
the 90s. Foulc and Atten [4,6] have proposed a theory to which 
the  conductivities  of  the  different  phases  (liquid  and  solid) 
have  a  major  role  in  the  interaction  between  particles  in  ER 
fluids.  

The  base  of  the  conduction  model  is  the  modelling  of  the 
force  between  two  spheres  in  contact  (representative  of  two 
particles in the ER fluids). Let’s consider two spheres of radius 
r (Fig. 6), immerged in a dielectric liquid and subjected to an 
electric  field  E.  εS,  εL,  σS,  σL  are  the  permittivities  and  the 
conductivities of the sphere and the liquid respectively.  

The  electric  field  increases  drastically  as  we  approach  the 
contact between the spheres. According to Onsager [7], from a 
certain  distance  (δ  in  Fig.6),  the  conductance  of  the  liquid 
equal  that  of  the  solid  and  a  leakage  current  cross  the  liquid 
between 
two  sphere  surfaces.  Two  areas  can  be 
distinguished.  In  the  first  area  (x  >  δ),  σsolid  >  σliquid  and  the 
current passes through the sphere.  In the second area (x < δ), 
σsolid < σliquid and the current goes through the liquid.

media (x > δ) and in liquid media (electrical 
contact zone, for x < δ). 

Using  this  hypothesis,  the  conduction  model  leads  to  two  laws  of  the  attraction  force  between 

spheres as a function of the electric field: 

 
- At low electric fields (<1 kV/mm), the variation of the force with the electric field is quadratic:  
                                                                                                                       (1) 

F ∝

 - For higher electric field (>1kV/mm), the force varies linearly with the field:

In  both  relations  (1)  and  (2)  for  low  and  high  electric  field,  a  term  called 

appears, 
showing  the  influence  of  the  conductivity  of  the  different  phases  on  the  force  between  the  two 
spheres.

The conduction model has good agreement with experiment as we also find two modes [8] and it 
works  properly  for  micro  sized  particles.  However, it is not sufficient enough to explain the high 
yield stress value of giant ER fluids. Other interactions seem to increase the strength of these fluids.  
An  explanation  for  the  unexpected  high  value  of  the  yield  stress  of  giant  ER  fluids  could  be 
found in the van der Waals forces. It indeed seems that the giant ER effect appears for nanoscaled 
molecules  and  van  der  Waals  forces  are  rather  short-range  interaction  (in  comparison  with 
electrostatic or chemical interactions).  

Van  der  Waals  forces.  Even  if  the  van  der  Waals  forces  are  very  weak,  they  can  become

powerful as the size of the particles decreases.  

 

We can find in literature [9] an approximation of the van der Waals forces betweens two spheres:

where A is the Hamaker constant for the considered media, r the radius (d the diameter) of the 
particles and h the distance between the two spheres. This force corresponds with the sum of all the 
interactions between molecules at the surface of the particles (cf. Fig. 7). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Figure 7: van der Waals interaction between two particles 

Taking the usual value 10-20 J for the Hamaker constant, 50 nm as radius and 0.3 nm between the 
two spheres leads to F ≈ 10-9 N. This value is the force between two spheres of a single fibre. We 
can consider that this force corresponds to the force of the whole fibres. Therefore the total force is 
the sum of the force due to all the fibres.

The biggest atom of urea (the surface layer of giant ER particles) is nitrogen whose van der Waals 
radius is 0.15 nm [10]. We can suppose that the minimum gap between two particles will therefore 
be h = 0.3nm. 
For Φ=0.3, d=100nm and h=0.3 nm we find τ ≈ 26 kPa. 
For Φ=0.3, d=50nm and h=0.3 nm we find τ ≈ 53 kPa. 

Eq. 6 shows that if the volume fraction and the total volume of fluid are constant, the static yield 
stress  increases  when  the  size  of  the  particles  decrease.  We  can  remark  that  the  τs  is  strongly 
dependent with the gap between the spheres. 

We are far from the 130 kPa but other parameters could improve the theory. This result shows 
that  reason  for  the  so  high  yield  stress  of  the  giant  ER  fluids  can  be  found  in  the  van  der  Waals 

forces. The softness of the particles certainly increases the contact area as the particles crush again 
each other contributing to a higher van der Waals interaction. 
 
Conclusion. This investigation shows the connection between the size of the particles and the yield 
stress. The van der Waals forces being a plausible cause of the giant ER effect. In this theory, the 
electric field would be use for bringing the particles closer enough for the van der Waals forces to 
appear. When the field is turned off, we can suppose that the brutal variation of the force act like a 
released spring whose energy is high enough to separate the particles. 

A  more  accurate  equation  of  the  van  der  Waals  forces  have  to  be  investigated,  taking  into 
account the smoothness of  the particles, a more precise Hamaker constant and the shape as well as 
the surface of the particles.

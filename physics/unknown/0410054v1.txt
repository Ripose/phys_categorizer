Abstract.  We live in a 3+1 space-time that is intended as a description of the universe with three space dimensions and 
one time dimension. Space-time dimensionality seems so natural that it is rarely criticized. Experiments and the highly 
successful relativistic theories teach us that there are four fundamental dimensions, among them is time that is treated 
as a special dimension. The specialty of time can be removed, leading to the concept that time is simply a function of 
four  new  fundamental  dimensions,  which  have  now  identical  properties,  in  combination  with  Lorentz  invariance.  A 
model  is  deduced  in  which  a  4-space,  characterized  by  four  space-like  coordinates,  may  host  four  "equivalent  but 
orthogonal"  space-times,  each  with  three  spatial  coordinates  and  one  temporal  coordinate.  Coordinates  are  shared; 
therefore the 4-space and the four space-times are all in one. Electromagnetic interaction is confined in each space-time 
and  the  role  of  the  speed  of  light  appears  to  be  that  of  a  barrier  for  the  electromagnetic  interaction.  The  motion  of 
objects can be described by four-dimensional optics in the 4-space. Each of the four space-times may host a universe 
and,  in  agreement  with  recent  observations,  the  proposed  model  can  be  directly  applied  to  problems  like  the 
cosmological  matter-antimatter  asymmetry  and  dark-matter  issues.    Space  travel  may  also  benefit  from  the  concepts 
presented. 

INTRODUCTION 

One  of  the  unsolved  mysteries  that  science  is  facing  and  trying  to  solve  is  the  origin  of  the  observed  matter-
antimatter asymmetry (Dine, 2004), even if the simplest model of the origin of the universe is in favor of a perfect 
symmetry, observed in accelerator experiments.  

The  antimatter  mystery  is  not  alone.  Observation  of  the  local  surroundings  and  of  the  far  reaches  of  the  universe 
with any possible optical instrument only shows the presence of void, electromagnetic radiation and matter,  more 
precisely baryon matter (consisting of strongly interacting fermions like protons, electrons and neutrons).  

Taking into account gravitational phenomena, a puzzling discovery has been made. Baryon matter is only 5% of the 
total energy density of the universe, less than 1/4 is some nonbaryonic matter, 3/4 is in a form of negative pressure, 
named cosmological constant (Peebles, 2003; Deffayet, 2002). Dark matter seems composed of a type of invisible 
objects of unknown size, that have mass but stay diluted and do not gravitationally accumulate to produce stars or 
planets.  These  objects  do  indeed  accumulate  at  scales  of  the  size  of  a  galaxy,  where  their  existence  has  been 
inferred;  they  may  also  induce  the  formation  of  the  galaxies  themselves.  How  can  this  happen?  Being  the 
nonbaryonic matter here within us, why we cannot see it, either directly, with a range of already built detectors or by 
any  possible  obscuration  effect  at  the  galactic  scale?    Why  the  exact  nature  of  the  nonbaryonic  matter  is  not  yet 
predicted  with  a  model  of  particles  that  is,  for  some  respects,  quite  accurate?    Does  it  really  exist  in  “our” 
local/visible universe? Can the understanding of the dark-matter problem be of any usefulness to correctly approach 
the cosmological constant problem or become the roots to quantum mechanics? 

The new paradigm considered is that “visible” baryon matter is a phenomenon that take place in the space-time we 
live in, and “living” means “producing electromagnetic phenomena”. On the contrary, dark matter populates one or 
more parallel universes that share one or more space-time dimensions with “our” local universe, which is embedded 

in “our” local space-time. Dark matter is therefore visible matter in “its” local universe.  Even the Einstein (Misner, 
1973) view of gravitation may set-up the link between parallel space-times. In fact curvature in a given space-time 
dimension may be observed from the different parallel universes that share the same dimension, the totality of the 
parallel universes are comprised in what we now consider the whole universe or, simply, the universe.    If the whole 
universe contains a superposition of a number of different space-times that are electro-magnetically orthogonal, i.e. 
space-times in which electromagnetic interaction is confined in its own space-time, then there is more “room” for 
different  forms  of  matter,  which  might  be  reciprocally  “incompatible”  if  mixed  directly.  Antimatter  could  be 
confined  in  a  parallel  universe,  and  the  same  may  be  true  for  other  forms  of  massive  particles.  According  to 
measurements  of  the  mass  ratio  between  visible  matter  and  dark  matter  obtained  from  the  observation  of  the 
dynamics of a large sample of galaxies, it is a reasonable hypothesis that baryon matter is about 1/5 of the total mass 
of  the  whole  matter  universe.  The  dark  matter  issue  is  therefore  resolved  by  the  possible  existence  of  four/five 
parallel  universes,  each  with  almost  the  same  total  mass.  Space-times  with  higher  dimensionality  are  frequently 
studied  in  theoretical  physics;  they  appear  in  the  Kaluza-Klein  theory,  string  theory  and  brane  theories.  In  most 
theories, the additional dimensions are curled to sizes of the order of the Planck length and therefore inaccessible for 
direct observation. Brane theories (Germani, 2002) predict large extra dimensions and experiments to observe the 
effects of the possible existence of “macroscopic” additional dimension have been performed with negative result so 
far. To ensure agreement with these data and to keep a full agreement with the well-known Special Relativity, the 
proposed  model  changes  our  view  of  reality  by  giving  to  “time”  the  secondary  role  of  derived  coordinate.    The 
overall number of fundamental large dimensions is still equal to the observed four, which have now the properties of 
spatial dimensions.  

DEDUCTION OF THE MODEL 

The proposed model was first inferred by attempting to write the wavefunction for gravitons in space-times in terms 
of a cosmological constant. Imposing the unitarity (the property that defines the probability to find the particle in 
space-time  to  be  one)  of  the  wavefunction  under  all  possible  energy  conditions  leads  to  inferring  the  possible 
existence of a hyperspace with 4 space-like dimensions, thus, it can be named 4-space. The possibility of a varying 
cosmological  constant  (Modanese,  2004),  which  brings  the  graviton  back  to  a  3+1  space-time,  opens  the  choice 
between 4 space-times with 3 space-like dimensions and one of time, therefore four 3+1 space-times should exist. 
We certainly live in one of these 3+1 space-times; hypotheses can be formulated for the role and the content of the 
remaining three space-times, and experiments will possibly discriminate among them. To independently show that 
four  3+1  space-times  exist,  we  need  to  understand  what  a  3+1  space-time  is  and,  more  specifically,  what  is  the 
difference between “space” and “time”. Unfortunately this is not an easy task. In General Relativity (Misner, 1973) 
the difference between space and time is encoded in a + or – sign in the metric. It is up to us to define the problem. 

It is due to Special Relativity that the difference originates between space and time. The difference is related to the 
constancy of the speed of light and its invariance for all observers (the Lorentz invariance), which is an experimental 
fact.  It  is  also  an  experimental  fact  that  space  dimensions  are  seen  to  be  three,  and  to  this  number  theories  must 
adapt. It is the scope of this paper to propose that reality can be different.  If the difference between space and time 
is modelled by Lorentz invariance, a different but equivalent formulation of Special Relativity may give some clue. 
In fact the concept of treating space and time the same way is the scope of Euclidean Special Relativity (ESR). The 
metric of flat space-time in ESR has the signature ++++, therefore our 3+1 space-time is described embedded in the 
4-space. With a closer look to ESR the four 3+1 space-times emerge with ease, and recognizing this possibility is 
one of the contributions given by this article. 

EUCLIDEAN SPECIAL RELATIVITY 

Historically, Euclidean Special Relativity has been first proposed by Montanus (2001) and then further developed by 
Gersten (2003). Almeida (2001) has recently and independently developed the same concepts and derived a theory 
named 4-dimensional optics (4DO). Gersten and Almeida recognized that the theory is an extension of ray and wave 
optics.  Recently,  Almeida  (2004b)  has  made  the  interesting  attempt  to  construct  a  4DO  theory  of  gravitation.  
Special Relativity (SR) has been developed to mathematically describe the observation that the speed of light is the 

same  for  all  observers.  This  fact  led  to  the  dismissal  of  Galilean  transformations  in  favour  of  the  Lorentz 
transformation. It became obvious that space and time were both part of a single entity named space-time, of which 
SR  predicted  the  relevant  properties  of  time  dilatation  and  mass  increase.    These  effects  are  confirmed  by  many 
experiments.  Despite  its  success,  SR  is  often  affected  by  ambiguities  of  interpretation  of  the  results.    In  SR,  the 
quantity:

with  c  equal  to  the  speed  of  light,  is  invariant  with  respect  to  a  Lorentz  transformation.  Minkowski  proposed 
considering t, x, y, and z as the coordinates of space-time, τ being a measure of the distance, named proper time.  
Equation (1) is the metric of flat space-time; it is a “local” description of the properties of space-time in absence of 
gravity. In ESR equation (1) is rewritten and discussed:

In equation (2) τ, x, y and z are the coordinates of the 4-space and t is the parameter used to evaluate velocity and 
acceleration; substantially equation (2) is the definition of time. Time t is an integral local function of changes of the 
four  space  coordinates,  dimensionally  aligned  by  c.  Time  exists  if  there  is  motion  in  the  4-space.  In  ESR  the 
measurability  of  time  t,  that  is  a  function  of  τ,  x,  y  and  z,  implies  the  existence  of  an  interaction  between  the 
measuring  instrument  and  the  environment.  The Lorentz  transformation  has been  found  to  be  described  by SO(4) 
rotations (Gersten, 2003).  

In the present interpretation of ESR the quantities that appear in the right member of equation (2) are homogeneous 
and  have  the  dimension  of  space  coordinates.    With τ  a  space  coordinate,  it  is  certainly  possible  to  explore  this 
coordinate by some technical means. To discover them, we observe that in Euclidean flat space there is an invariant, 
the square of the four-velocity, obtained from equation (2) by dividing by (dt)2:

In ESR there is a single 4-space in which all particles, for which Lorentz transformation is applicable, travel at the 
speed of light. Gersten indeed recognized that equation (3) is a restriction in the 4-space, i.e. it defines a subspace in 
which  Lorentz  transformation  may  occur  for  one  particle  state.  Taking  the  Lagrangian  for  a  free  object  of  ESR

being L=K-U, kinetic energy minus potential energy, we have for a free massive particle E=mc2. The expression is 
simple because in ESR (in absence of gravity) mass does not depend on velocity and velocity is a universal constant: 
E is a constant of motion. Since E ∝ m, E can be easily interpreted to be the energy required to literally “launch” a 
particle into existence. For particles with velocity in the 3-space equal to zero, it is the first term in left member of 
equation (3) that is equal to the square of the speed of light. The same applies to the other three possibilities in which 
particles travel at low speed (compared to c) in the 3-spaces (τ , x, y), (τ , x,  z) and (τ ,  y,  z). It is only necessary to 
show  that  photons  travel  only  in  a  3-space  to  conclude  that  four  electromagnetically  orthogonal  (i.e.  reciprocally 
invisible  for  observers  at  rest  in  each  one)  sets  of  particles  (local  universes  for  which  Lorentz  invariance  is 
applicable)  might  exist  in  the  4-space.  The  existence  of  four  orthogonal  sets  of  particles,  which  we  can  consider 
hosted  by  four  space-times,  is  motivated  by  the  principle  of  symmetry:  all  space  dimensions  have  identical 
properties,  exactly  as  equation  (2)  suggests.  Local  universes  travel  at  the  speed  of  light  along  the  4  orthogonal 
coordinates  of  a  reference  system  for  which  “directions”  and  “velocity”  are  univocally  defined.  Inside  each  local 
universe SR maintains its validity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Photons travel only in 3-space because for photons in the local universe, for instance in (x, y, z), we have: 

that represents the constancy of the speed of light. Therefore considering the same photons in the 4-space we have:

These photons cannot move along the space dimension τ, while the respective matter  universe runs away along τ 
with speed c. The same apply to the remaining three space-times.   This is obviously in agreement with SR in (x, y, 
z, t), in fact photons are particles that have an “onboard clock” completely at rest.  When matter increases its speed 
in a 3-space and approaches the speed of light, it shifts towards another parallel universe, as shown by equation (3). 
A  spacecraft  travelling  in  a  3-space  at  about  half  the  speed  of  light  should  be  capable  of  detecting  one  or  more 
different  parallel  universes  and  in  principle  should  be  capable  of  reaching  them.  It  seems  also  quite  natural  to 
attribute the same behavior to the stellar objects we observe at the edge of our visible universe, objects that seem to 
fall towards an undefined border.  

FIGURE 1. Local Representation of the Four 3+1 Space-times. 

Figure  (1)  represents  the  four  space-times  in  a  locally  Euclidean  4-space.  Particles  that  are  at  rest  (in  their  own 
space-time)  travel  at  speed  c  along  their  “proper  time”  coordinate  of  the  4-space.  Our  space-time  is  symbolically 
made with bricks and consists of an infinite number (a continuum) of τ-frames, some are shown as contour lines. 
Particle  P  can  reach  a  different  space-time  (P->P’)  with  the  help  of  a  Lorentz  transformation,  a  SO4  rotation. 
Traveling between different τ-frames requires the change of the local speed of light, this in turn requires a refractive 
index different from unity for the propagation of massive particles, and the effect is produced by the presence of a 
gravitational field. 

ESR has its own paradoxes, which are different from those of SR. For instance, if I do the action of switching on a 
lamp, equation (6) shows that the photons emitted by the lamp in my 3-space will never reach my eyes. In fact my 

speed along the space dimension τ is c, and the speed of the emitted photons along the space dimension τ is zero. 
Therefore the photons do indeed travel in 3-space, towards me, at speed c but they will reach my “ghost” in a past τ-
frame.  The  solution  is  that  the  photons  that  reach  my  eyes  are  emitted  in  some  future τ-frame,  and  my  action  of 
switching  on  the  lamp  only  “seems”  to  be  purely  deliberate  in  my  present  τ-frame.  The  4-space  encodes  past, 
present and future in its four dimensions.  

For sentient beings, as we are, all information is carried by photons, this fact explains why we can only act in our 
present. We are a part of a universe that “travels” in space towards the future along the τ coordinate, our activity in 
the  present  “processes”  the  incoming  future  and  produces  the  past  along  the τ  coordinate.  The  fact  that  we  see 
photons  coming  from  future τ-frames  and  from  different  distances  in  3-space,  teach  us  that  there  is  an  infinite 
number of τ-frames before and after our frame and each frame is the present of another material existence. The τ-
frames are all alive the same way: past and future τ-frames are as real as our present in the 4-space, therefore it is the 
4-space  that  contains  the  information,  matter  is  only  a  process.  The  philosophical  impact  of  this  interpretation  of 
ESR will be discussed later.  

Causality  is  not  a  property  of  the  4-space,  in  which  there  is  no  time  coordinate.  Causality  is  a  property  of  non-
intersecting time-lines (sequences of τ frames), that are non-intersecting trajectories followed by particles for which 
Lorentz invariance is applicable. In this picture, local universes follow straight trajectories, free of time-line loops. 

PARTICLES, FORCES AND GRAVITATION IN THE 4-SPACE 

ESR has been derived from SR, therefore it inherits a partial experimental validation from SR. 4DO, that is a theory 
of gravity in 4-space, inherits a partial experimental validation from GR. In fact it is possible to convert the metrics 
of  GR  into  refractive  indices  and  both  theories  can  give  equivalent  or  comparable  prediction  (Almeida,  2004b; 
Montanus, 2001). Obviously, the interpretation of the results is different. New experiments will allow discriminating 
among the different approaches.   According to Almeida (2001), in Euclidean space it is possible to write: 

it has been already shown that in ESR the metric tensor is:

the Schwarzschild’s metric of General Relativity can be obtained (Almeida, 2001). A comparable model has been 
proposed  by  Montanus  (2001),  employing  exponential  refractive  indices,  which  agree  with  GR  using  a  series 
expansion.    It  is  the  possibility  of  making  these  links  between  4DO  and  GR  that  gives  4DO  a  chance  to  satisfy 
various test of GR, those have already passed the experimental verification. The interpretation of the experimental 
results is obviously different. Future experiments might challenge the two theories.  

The refractive index therefore describes the properties of the 4-space, on the other hand the substitution ds2=n(dτ2) 
indicates  that with  the presence  of  matter  and  assuming GR fully  valid,  the  refractive  index  is  not  isotropic, with 
components  that  depend  on  the  four  directions,  this  is  better  shown  by  resorting  to  a  coordinate  transformation 
(d’Inverno, 1996) with a rigorous calculation of the two refractive indices (Almeida, 2004a). The relations between 
GR and 4DO indicate that gravity propagates in four dimensions, this obviously holds for weak gravitational waves, 
which travel at speed c (far from a gravitational field) in the 4-space. The refractive index of the 4-space appears as 
a square in the Euclidean metric of equation (13) and with |n|<1, i.e. for Gm>r, the speed in the 4-space is higher 
than the speed of light. In fact comparing equation (2) with equation (13) the speed of all particles in the 4-space 
with a refractive index, i.e. with gravity, is v=c/|n|.  In this situation the Euclidean theory is easier to interpret than 
General Relativity. The solution for trajectories in the 4-space can be obtained by applying the Fermat’s principle in 
four dimensions, the name 4DO originates from this approach. 

Particles are described by waves in the 4-space, because all particles are in motion at some finite speed. Almeida 
(2001) has suggested identifying these waves with the matter waves of Quantum Mechanics. Equation (7) admits the 
solution in forms of waves parametrized along t:

       (15) 

Therefore waves  appear  as  soon  as  a  direction  is defined,  and  the process  is  obviously  a  “readout”  in 4-space. In 
fact,  if  the  refractive  index  of  the  4-space  encodes  a  pattern,  then  the  motion  of  the  wave/particle  reproduces  the 
encoded  information.  On  the  other  hand  the  “readout”  influences  the  4-space  as  in  the  example  of  equation  (14), 
where the mass of a particle associated to a wave changes the refractive index of the 4-space.  

By combining v=c/|n| with equation (14) we have:

For small masses and large distances, the presence of a mass reduces the local speed of light, which according to 
E=mc2 and assuming conservation of energy, changes the local mass of an additional particle in the nearby 4-space 
to m(c2/v2). Therefore mass may diverge if mass density goes above a given limit and energy is conserved. Without 
going into further details it seems that 4DO is non-linear like GR and therefore capable of offering many interesting 
developments. Non-linear mass summation can be tracked back to a positive reaction in the refractive index in spite 
of  the  fact  that  the  local  universe  travels  at  speed  c  along  its  fourth  dimension,  in  fact  gravity  propagates  in  four 
dimensions and n exhibits no delay. Photons travel in three dimensions and a propagation loop between two photons 
at different τ in four dimensions is not possible: electromagnetism is linear. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ESR and the notion of a refractive index of the 4-space are a significant departure from the concepts of GR: 4-space 
is flat, it has a refractive index, everything that is not a refractive index is in motion and the velocity is a function of 
the refractive index. Forces are associated to changes in the trajectory of particles due to the refractive index. The 
concept  of  force  in  a  3+1  space-time  as  projection  of  trajectories  in  the  4-space  suggests  a  simple  and  unified 
approach to the problem.  Different forces, those that obey to different rules in the 3+1 space-time,  are naturally 
associated to different particles and different properties of the refractive index. If a particle responds to more than 
one  force,  it  must be  a  composite  particle. With full  analogy with  optical  materials,  the  refractive  index  of  the 4-
space could be a function of frequency, thus allowing a 4DO model for all interactions and explaining the different 
intensity  of  the  different  known  forces.  Frequency  modulation  of  a  particle  wavefunction  (by  vibrations  at 
relativistic speeds in the 3-space) should change its frequency spectrum and control the intensity of natural forces. 
Experiments  very  similar  to  those  devised  for  studying  High  Frequency  Gravitational  Waves  (HFGW)  (Fontana, 
2004 and 2003b; Baker, 2004) are suggested to study the properties of the refractive index of the 4-space.  

There are speculations about the possibility that the universe might be a gigantic simulation (Bostrom, 2003). After 
familiarizing with  ESR  and 4DO,  one  might  be  tempted  to  identify  the  refractive  index with  a  memory  device  in 
which wave/particles play the role of signals flowing through the 4D optical circuits of the universe. 

PERSPECTIVES FOR SPACE TRAVEL AND PROPULSION 

The Euclidean view of dimensionality is sufficient to offer a new perspective to space travel. Interactions that are 
based on electromagnetism are confined in the 3-space and all known propulsion techniques, except one, relate to 
electromagnetic  interaction, often  at  the  molecular  level. With  3  degrees  of  freedom,  a  large  amount  of  energy  is 
required to give kinetic energy to an object in the 3-space. On the contrary, gravitational propulsion techniques can 
directly operate in the 4-space, and a well-known example of gravitational propulsion is “gravity assist”.  In the 4-
space all particles travel at the speed of light, therefore the capacity of traveling can be defined as the capacity of 
steering  in  the  4-space  that  is  the  capacity  of  making  Lorentz  transformations.  In  fact  for  “gravity  assist”  no 
propulsion is required, only the capacity of steering. HFGW have been studied in GR and can be used for “artificial 
gravity assist” (Fontana, 2000 and 2003; Baker, 2004), similar techniques might be entirely developed within ESR 
and 4DO. Space travel between different τ-frames seems also possible by locally changing the refractive index, and 
the effect is produced by the presence of a gravitational field. 

The 4-space do not suffer by the metrical distortions of General Relativity that lead to the difficult interpretation and 
visualization  of  the  results  of  that  theory.  In  the  4-space,  gravitation  is  encoded  in  the  refractive  index  and  it  has 
been  easily  demonstrated  that  inside  the  event  horizon  of  a  Schwarzschild’s  black  hole  the  4-velocity  of  every 
particle  is  higher  than  the  speed  of  light.  This  is  not  associated  to  paradoxes  or  conceptual  difficulties.   
Unfortunately  the  counterpart  of  the  Einstein  equations  for  4DO  have  not,  as  of  yet,  been  discovered,  except  for 
simple  cases  derived  from  GR.  It  is  possible  that  a  combination  of  properties  of  the  4-space  may  contribute  to 
change n(τ, x, y, z), and these properties should involve particles belonging to the four parallel universes 

CONCLUSION 

The properties of the graviton in space-times with a cosmological constant and variants of SR strongly suggest that 
our 3+1 space-time is a special case in a more fundamental 4-space.  The 4-space can host four electromagnetically 
orthogonal space-times, one of them is our space-time, in which we can only physically operate on a single frame 
along  τ,  that  is  the  “present”.  Gravitational  phenomena  can  allow  navigation  in  the  4-space  and,  as  soon  as 
technology will permit, it will be possible to discover the possible real existence and nature of the remaining three 
space-times. Observed gravitational phenomena have already shown that the total mass of the universe is four to five 
times  the  mass  of  the  visible  universe.  This  observation  is  encouraging  for  the  presented  approach.  In  addition, 
recalling  the  introduction,  some  parallel  universes  might  be  “antimatter  universes”,  therefore  they  can  become  a 
precious source of fuel for spacecrafts equipped with devices or engines capable of producing gravitational fields 
strong enough to capture even a limited flow of atoms in the parallel universe.  

In Euclidean 4-space, extended with the Schwarzschild’s solution that suggests the existence of a refractive index, 
particles  can  travel  with  a  speed  higher  than  the  speed  of  light  without  producing  paradoxes. Within the  simplest 
model, the most disconcerting property of the 4-space approach is that the perceived “flow of time” is obviously a 
“readout/modify”  process  of  a  predetermined  or  prerecorded  story  encoded  in  the  refractive  index.  The  presented 
“almost static but reactive” view (which leaves the already visited regions of 4-space affected by the process) of the 
universe  differs  from  the  early  interpretation  of  cosmology  in  GR,  which  was  static  and  with  no  “events”  or 
“choices”.  Abandoning  “time  t”  as  a  principal  dimension  in  favor  of  four  spatial  dimensions  suggests  the 
interpretation of  reality  as  a  “trip”  in  a  prerecorded  sequence  of  possibilities  in  which material  objects  follow  the 
laws of physics and sentient beings can act by choosing their paths. It is implicit that the prerecorded sequence can 
be modified every time a “readout” is performed. Subsequently this happens in the “present”, but it may happen in 
the “future” and in the “past” along the τ  space coordinate respect to our space-time.  

Like General Relativity, the presented Euclidean model of reality admits something like time travel. It is not time 
travel indeed; it is τ travel. Personal (local) time t cannot be affected because it depends on Lorentz invariance, a τ 
traveler can jump into different time-lines (sequences of τ frames) and follows them actively as soon as the τ travel 
machine is switched off. In the 4-space this is indeed space travel.

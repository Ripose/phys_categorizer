AGAIN ON MAJORANA AND THE THOMAS-FERMI MODEL:
A COMMENT TO PHYSICS/0511222

S. ESPOSITO

Abstract. We comment on a recent paper announcing the discovery of a
previously unknown publication of Ettore Majorana on the Thomas-Fermi
atomic model.
In pointing out that such a publication was not written by
Majorana, we correct some misunderstandings and clarify the historical and
scientiﬁc relevance of the “forgotten publication”.

In a recent paper [1] the authors claim to have discovered “a forgotten publication
of Ettore Majorana on the improvement of the Thomas-Fermi statistical model”,
quoting also the corresponding reference to the Italian journal “Il Nuovo Cimento”
[2]. Such a publication refers to a communication at the XXII General Meeting
of the Italian Physical Society, made by Majorana on December 29, 1928, where
he reported on some peculiar applications to atomic and molecular spectra of the
statistical model introduced by Thomas [3] and, independently, by Fermi [4] few
years earlier. This paper has served to give a (partial) re-analysis of the role played
by Majorana in the formulation of the Thomas-Fermi atomic model. We realize
the relevance of this publication [1] and its integration among the few public ap-
pearances of Ettore Majorana in the scientiﬁc scenario of his epoch. However, in
view of the potential importance of this subject, we have to remark that some of
the conclusions derived in it should be critically revised.

The reason for considering the communication in [2] as a “forgotten publication”
is based on the fact that it is not reported in the list of publications by Ettore
Majorana, ﬁrst given by a friend and colleague of him, Edoardo Amaldi [5], and
subsequently adopted by other authors. This occurrence, together with the fact
that the Majorana communication did not receive any mention in the works by
Fermi and his associates (Amaldi was one of them), has led to postulate that “the
Majorana proposal was not accepted by Enrico Fermi for years, and forgotten”,
while “at the end, Fermi eventually fully accepted Majorana improved scheme, and
exploited it in the conclusive paper on the subject” (this paper is the one in Ref.
[6]).

However, such a suggestive conclusion appears, at a deeper analysis, slightly

incorrect and a much simpler explanation seems to emerge.

First of all, a careful reading of the paper in [2] reveals that it was not written by
Majorana, although the corresponding talk at the Meeting was instead delivered by
him, as appears clearly from the accurate study of his style through his published
and unpublished notes, an account of which can be found in Ref.
[7]. However,
even without invoking such an expertise, it is a matter of fact that the material
published in Ref.
[2] in “Il Nuovo Cimento”, which was the oﬃcial organ of the
Italian Physical Society, referred to the formal minutes of the General Meeting
of that Society, and even the scientiﬁc communications (with the sole, probable,

1

2

exception of a couple of them) were written by the secretary of the Society, G. Dalla
Noce (a former engineer and, then, a theoretical physicists).

In this respect the paper in [2] cannot be regarded as a publication by Ettore
Majorana, and thus it was never mentioned as such by Amaldi, Fermi and others.
Nevertheless, useful information may be deduced by what contained in [2], the
most intriguing one being that the young Majorana was invited to deliver that talk
well before to have got his “laurea” degree in Physics. In fact, he graduated in July
1929, and the topics covered in his communication were completely diﬀerent from
those discussed in his master thesis (on the theory of radioactive nuclei) and even
only marginally related to his ﬁrst article [8] on Atomic Physics, in collaboration
with G. Gentile Jr, also published before his graduation in Physics. Evidently,
the relevance of the work performed by Majorana at the Institute of Physics in
Rome, “inspired” by discussions with Fermi and coworkers, was well recognized by
Fermi himself who, as in some other occasions, urged the young researcher to make
publicly available the conclusions obtained.

The attitude of Majorana not to spread the results of a given research, until
its perfect reﬁnement (according to his hypercritical judgement) was completed or
when they were considered premature, manifested here in the fact that he decided
to not publish them in the form of a regular article. This is clearly stated at the end
of the communication in [2], “the researches performed till now are still too much
scarce to fully appreciate such results”, and, as said, it is typical of the personality
of Majorana. Likely, the fact that the Meeting was held in the Institute of Physics,
where he was currently performing his studies, played some role in Majorana’s
decision to give a talk.
In any case it is quite evident that Fermi was well aware of the work done by
Majorana on the statistical model of atoms, and pushed his student to present it
in the occasion of the General Meeting of the Italian Physical Society. Note also
that the communication by Majorana was “sandwiched” between two other ones
by Fermi [2], and no question was posed by the conveners (including Fermi).

An accurate historical reconstruction of the appearance and ﬁrst developments
of the statistical model of atoms, which focuses on the main results achieved by the
group of Fermi in Rome and on the role played by Majorana, can be found in Ref.
[9]. Here we do not repeat what reported there, but just comment on some scientiﬁc,
rather than historical, issues. The systematic contributions by Majorana may be
[7], where ﬁve notebooks by Majorana are translated into English
found in Ref.
and published for the ﬁrst time. The original material behind the communication
in [2] is there reported at pages 116-117.

According to Majorana, the topic studied is the second approximation for the
potential inside the atom, with a generalization (rather than an improvement) of
the Thomas-Fermi model of neutral atoms of atomic number Z to those ionized
n times (including the case n = 0). The starting point is the physical fact that
such a potential is deﬁned up to an additive constant C, as already clearly stated
[4]. This occurrence is exploited
by Fermi as long as in his 1927 paper in Ref.
by Majorana in order to shift the attention from the local potential V0 in a given
point inside the atom or the ion (that is the potential of the nucleus and Z − n
electrons), to the eﬀective potential V acting on one electron in that point (that
is the potential of the nucleus and Z − n − 1 electrons). The two potentials are

connected, approximatively, by a simple scaling relation that Majorana writes as

(0.1)

∇2V =

Z − n − 1
Z − n

∇2V0

(instead Fermi, in 1934 [6], will write as

V0,

V =

(0.2)

Z − n − 1
Z − n
that is the scaling relation is assumed here to hold directly on the potentials). Since
V0 satisﬁes the Poisson equation with a charge density ρ, ∇2V0 = −4πρ, the eﬀective
potential V is that generated by a rescaled charge density ρ(Z − n − 1)/(Z − n),
thus taking into account the ﬁnite charge of the given electron on which V (rather
than V0) acts. Although in a completely diﬀerent context, the procedure is rather
similar to that now adopted in the renormalization of physical quantities in modern
gauge theories.
The eﬀective potential is

where ϕ is the Thomas-Fermi screening function (µ is a dimensionful parameter)
and the constant C is interpreted as value of the potential at the boundary of the
atom (or the ion), which thus acquires a ﬁnite radius r0 (= µx0):

Consequently, the maximum energy U (which, in general, is negative) of one bounded
electron is diﬀerent from zero and proportional to C:

From this expression, the Rydberg corrections to the energy levels of a given atom
or ion may be easily deduced.
As appears very clearly from Ref. [2] and what expounded above, the key role in the
Majorana approach is played by the additive constant C, rather than by the ﬁnite
radius r0. Although the question of the eﬀective atomic radius, as emphasized in
[1], rests on solid physical grounds (an atom or an ion has indeed a ﬁnite extension)
and was referred to very early, it is not very relevant for practical applications at a
given level of approximation. In a sense, as also shown by Majorana, a ﬁnite radius
r0 can always be obtained by requiring a ﬁnite range for the potential V , and this
is simply achieved through the introduction of a suitable constant C, which can
always be added to the potential. In this respect, it seems not correct to interpret
[1] the term C as a Lagrange multiplier which constraints the atom to have a ﬁnite
radius, and, in any case, this does not correspond to what done by Majorana.

Furthermore, regarding the possible refusal or acceptance of the Majorana view-

point by Fermi, the following points should be taken into account.
In almost all the papers by Fermi on this subject, where he reports also few theo-
retical calculations about the Thomas-Fermi model, the question of the deﬁnition
of the potential inside the atom up to an additive constant is always explicitly as-
serted1 [4], [10], [6].

1In particular note that the correct expression for the electron density n is that in Eq. (5) of
Ref. [4] (or similar equations in Refs. [10], [6]), with the potential denoted by Fermi with v, and

4

In the papers dealing with neutral atoms (starting from Ref. [4] of 1927), though
not expressly mentioned, the constant is chosen to be zero or, in other words, it
is imposed for simplicity that the atomic radius be inﬁnite (the upper limit in the
integral in Eq. (10) of Ref. [4] is ∞).
In the article in Ref. [10] of 1930-1, discussing the energy spectra of ionized atoms,
a ﬁnite radius r0 for them has to be explicitly assumed, as well known, but this is
introduced along the same lines followed by Majorana, that is the additive constant
playing a key role (see the discussion in [10] from Eq. (1) to Eq. (5)). However
it is evident as well that the subtleties envisaged by Majorana, in distinguishing
the local potential from the eﬀective one, are not present at all (they can be ne-
glected at the degree of approximation considered there). This is easily recognized
by noting that the expressions quoted by Majorana in [2] (or, better, in Sect. 15
of Volumetto 2 in [7]) reduce to those reported by Fermi in [10] by replacing n + 1
with n (or z, as Fermi originally denoted the ionization degree).
Finally, in the last paper of the Fermi group on the applications of the Thomas-
Fermi model, published in 1934 [6], the “choice” (according to Fermi and Amaldi
wording) of the atomic potential is made by following completely2 the reasoning
[1]. This is required by the improvement in
of Majorana, as pointed out in Ref.
the degree of approximation pursued here by the authors, with respect to previous
calculations, which now include relativistic corrections too. In fact, the “second
approximation” (as termed by Majorana) for the eﬀective potential depends on the
ratio between the degree of ionization and the atomic number (remember that such
ratio is written, approximatively, as n/Z in [10] and, correctly, as (n + 1)/Z in [6]
and [2]), so that it has some (small) inﬂuence only for lighter elements, as consid-
ered only in Ref. [6]. Here, in fact, Z ≥ 10, while in Ref. [10] the calculations were
carried out for Z = 23, 50, 82 (in previous calculations, the degree of approximation
is rough and then the eﬀect considered here is irrelevant).

From what discussed above, assuming that Fermi was aware of the Majorana ap-
proach (see the acknowledgment in Ref. [2]), it seems rather reasonable that Fermi
did not refuse that approach, but simply used it only when explicitly necessary,
according to his general attitude to avoid unnecessary mathematical complications.
The same applies to the Fermi and Segr`e paper [11] on hyperﬁne structures of
atomic spectra of 1933; in particular, note the discussion from Eq. (13) to Eq. (17)
there.
[2] is the
In practice, what can be safely deduced from the appearance of Ref.
following. Majorana discussed with Fermi (and, maybe, others) a reﬁnement of
the statistical model of atoms and some applications of it (on the chemical bonds
and the Roentgen spectra), and Fermi, convinced of the theoretical relevance of
the results obtained by Majorana, urged him to communicate those results at the
General Meeting of the Italian Physical Society in 1928, in between two talks of his
since Majorana was still not graduated. Majorana, on the other hand, consider-
ing premature his own results according to his hypercritical feeling, decided to not
publish them in a regular article. Fermi applied, even tough in a slightly diﬀerent
way (see above), the reﬁnement of the statistical model only when required by the

not that reported in Eq. (1) of Ref. [1], with the potential denoted with V : these two potentials
diﬀer, exactly, for an additive constant!

accuracy of the results to be obtained, and the lacking3 of the acknowledgment
to Majorana’s work is probably a too weak argument to rediscuss the relations
between the two scientists.

In conclusion, while the important role played by Majorana, in the formula-
tion and ﬁrst developments of the Thomas-Fermi statistical model of atoms, is
undoubtedly recognized, as discussed extensively in [9], the relevant theoretical is-
sue behind the work related to Ref. [2] appears to be what we can improperly term
the renormalization procedure of the Thomas-Fermi potential. However, it seems
quite reductive to focus only on this contribution, while Majorana introduced some
other generalizations of the model, disregarding his solution of the Thomas-Fermi
non-linear equation [12], [13]. Almost all on this unpublished (by the author) work
can be found in the book in [7], and the interested reader can usefully follow the
related discussion in Ref. [9].

We end with the hope, also envisaged in [1], that future recognitions of the
outstanding but unknown work performed by Majorana in completely diﬀerent
areas of Physics, shall “not rely on more or less arbitrary reconstructions from
fragmentary unpublished sources”, but take beneﬁt of already established results.
We warmly thank Ettore Majorana Jr for having pointed out the appearance of

the preprint in [1] and for valuable discussions.

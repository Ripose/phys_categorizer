The singular points of Einstein’s universe †

by Marcel Brillouin

(translation by S. Antoci∗)

1. Einstein’s four-dimensional Universe is determined by the ten gµν of its ds2. In order to
determine them it is not suﬃcient to know the six independent partial diﬀerential equations that
they must fulﬁl; one needs also to know the conditions at the boundaries of the Universe, which are
necessary for specialising the integrals in view of given problems. These boundary conditions are of
two sorts. One deals with the far away state of the Universe, completely outside the region where we
wish to study the events; it is the one whose choice, still in dispute, is translated into this question:
is the Universe inﬁnite? Is it ﬁnite, although without limit? I do not bother with this here. The
other one deals with the singular lines that correspond to what, from the experimental viewpoint,
we call the attractive masses. In Newtonian gravitation the material point of mass m corresponds
to the point of the Euclidean space where the integral of Laplace’s equation becomes inﬁnite like
m/r, where r is (in the neighbourhood of this point) the distance from the material point to the
point where one studies the Newtonian potential. It is this kind of singularities, characteristic of
matter, that I come to consider.

We ﬁrst remark that, in the present state of our experimental knowledge, nothing entitles us
to suppose that singular points (in four dimensions) may exist in the Universe. From the analytical
viewpoint, this impossibility is evidently connected with the distinction that exists between one of
the variables and the remaining three, which allows for the sign changes of ds2, like in acoustics.
It would be interesting to give precision to this remark.

2. Let us consider a static, permanent state, i.e. a state in which the gµν depend only on three
of the variables, x1, x2, x3, and are independent of that x4 whose g44 in essentially positive. The
simplest singular line of Universe is the one which, in the section with the three dimensions x1, x2,
x3 that we call space, corresponds to an isotropic singular point.

For a Universe that contains only one line of this kind Schwarzschild has integrated, in 1916,
the diﬀerential equations that rule the gµν , and he obtained a ds2 that, by changing Schwarzschild’s
notations, I write under the form

ds2 = γc2dτ 2 −

γ

dR2 − (R + 2m)2(dθ2 + sin2θdϕ2),

γ =

R

R + 2m

,

c, velocity of light (universal constant);
θ, ϕ, the spherical polar angles in space;
R, a length such that the sphere, whose centre is at the singular point in the (non Euclidean) space
R, θ, ϕ, and which has R for co-ordinate radius, has a total surface equal to 4π(R + 2m)2, and
2π(R + 2m) as circumference of the great circle.

The function γ is positive, and equal to 1 at a large distance; m is a positive constant. If R is

not zero, γ is ﬁnite and nonvanishing; there is no singularity either of gµν or of ds2.

But, if R is zero, γ is zero, and the coeﬃcient of dR2 is inﬁnite: there is a pointlike singularity

in this point in space, and a line singularity in the Universe.

3. One may wonder whether this singularity limits the Universe, and one must stop at R = 0
or, on the contrary, it only traverses the Universe, which shall continue on the other side, for R < 0.
In the discussions at the “Coll`ege de France”, in particular in the ones held during the Easter of
1922, it has been generally argued as if R = 0 would mean a catastrophic region that one needs
to cross in order to attain the true, singular limit, that one only reaches when γ is inﬁnite, with
R = −2m. In my opinion, it is the ﬁrst singularity, reached when R = 0, γ = 0 (m > 0), the one
that limits the Universe and that must not be crossed [C. R., 175, (November 27th 1922)].

The reason for this is peremptory, although up to now I have neglected to put it in evidence:
for R < 0, γ < 0, in no way the ds2 any longer corresponds to the problem one aimed at dealing
with.

In order to see it clearly, let us put anew the letters x1...x4 whose physical meaning shall not
be suggested by old habits. Schwarzschild’s ds2 corresponds to the following analytical problem:
the gµν depend only on the single variable x1; two more variables, θ and ϕ, enter in the manner
that corresponds to the spatial isotropy around one point, and one has:

ds2 = γc2dx2

4 −

1
γ

dx2

1 − (x1 + 2m)2(dθ2 + sin2θdϕ2),

The term γ is positive either when

or when

γ =

x1

x1 + 2m

m > 0.

x1 > 0 and x1 + 2m > 0

x1 < 0 and x1 + 2m < 0;

one has truly solved the proposed problem, x1 is a spatial variable and x4 is a time variable.

4.

If γ is instead negative, −2m < x1 < 0, the characters of length and of duration are
1 is positive, while the term γc2dx2
4

exchanged between x1 and x4; in fact now the term −(1/γ)dx2
is negative.

Let us make this character visible by substituting the notation t for −x1:

ds2 =

2m − t

t

dt2 −

t

2m − t

dx2

4 − (2m − t)2(dθ2 + sin2θdϕ2).

This is a ds2 which has no longer any relation with the static problem that one aimed at
dealing with. The ds2 for x1 < 0 does not continue the one that is appropriate for x1 > 0. This
discontinuity is by far sharper than all the ones that have been encountered up to now in the
problems of mathematical physics. The frontier x1 = 0, R = 0, is really an insurmountable one.

While discussing Schwarzschild’s integration one notices that an arbitrary factor C4 could
have been left in the term with dx4, and that this factor is taken equal to 1 in order that the
Universe become Euclidean when x1 is inﬁnite. No similar condition can be imposed in the interval
−2m < x1 < 0; but C4 is a real constant, and it can only be taken with a positive value. In fact,
if it were negative, the ds2 would no longer have any meaning that refer to an Einstein’s universe.
5. The conclusion seems to me unescapable: the limit R = 0 is insurmountable; it embodies

the material singularity.

The distance r from this origin (R = 0) to a point with co-ordinate radius R, calculated along

a radius vector (θ = const., ϕ = const.) is (1)

r = pR(R + 2m) + m ln

R + m + pR(R + 2m)

m

.

The ratio between the circumference 2π(R + 2m) and the radius is everywhere larger than 2π;
in particular at the origin (r = 0, R = 0) this ratio becomes inﬁnite. The circumference of the great
circle of the origin is 4πm; the spherical surface of that point has the ﬁnite value 4π(2m)2. It is
this singularity that constitutes what physics calls the material point; it is the factor m appearing
in it that must be called mass.

In view of this occurrence, the word material point is perhaps ill chosen. In fact, due to the
ﬁnite extension of the spherical surface of the point, the variations of θ and of ϕ truly displace the
extremity of the radius vector (of zero length) over this surface as it would occur over any other
sphere whose co-ordinate radius R and whose radius r were nonvanishing.

Anyway, since nothing more pointlike can be found in Einstein’s Universe, and since one really
needs attaining a deﬁnition of the elementary material test body which, according to Einstein,
follows a geodesic of the Universe to which it belongs, I will maintain this abridged nomenclature,
material point, without forgetting its imperfection.

(1) Erratum. In the already cited note of the C. R. the coeﬃcient −m/2 of the logarithm is incorrect.

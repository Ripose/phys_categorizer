Abstract

Dirac’s approach to gauge symmetries is discussed. We follow closely the steps

that led him from his conjecture concerning the generators of gauge transformations

at a given time —to be contrasted with the common view of gauge transformations

as maps from solutions of the equations of motion into other solutions— to his de-

cision to artiﬁcially modify the dynamics, substituting the extended Hamiltonian

(including all ﬁrst-class constraints) for the total Hamiltonian (including only the

primary ﬁrst-class constraints). We show in detail that Dirac’s analysis was incom-

plete and, in completing it, we prove that the fulﬁlment of Dirac’s conjecture —in

the “non-pathological” cases— does not imply any need to modify the dynamics.

We give a couple of simple but signiﬁcant examples.

1 Introduction

It has been more than ﬁfty years since the formal development of the theory of constrained

systems saw the light with the work of Dirac and Bergmann. By the end of the 1940’s,

these two physicists, independently, Peter Bergmann with diﬀerent collaborators [1, 2,

3] and Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac, working alone [4], began the systematic study of

the canonical formalism for what we today call gauge theories (here including generally

2

covariant theories), also known —in an almost1 equivalent terminology— as constrained

systems.

Since these early stages, Bergmann’s purpose was nothing other than the quantization

of gravity, whereas for Dirac the purpose was rather the generalization of Hamiltonian

methods, in view also of quantization, but mostly for special relativistic theories, and

the development of his ideas on the forms of relativistic dynamics [5]. Eventually the

application to general relativity made its way indirectly into Dirac’s approach when he

considered the quantization on curved surfaces [6] (see also [7] [8] where general relativity

was properly addressed).

The quantization of gravity is an elusive subject that still remains basically unresolved,

because of both technical and conceptual obstacles. In addition to the fact that general

relativity described gravity as a feature of the geometry of space-time, there was the

problem that, since it was a gauge theory —in the form of diﬀeomorphism invariance—,

its Hamiltonian formulation was unknown, because the standard procedure of translating

the formulation from tangent space —with a Lagrangian as a starting point— to phase

space met with some technical diﬃculties that had not yet been addressed. Solving these

diﬃculties was part of the contribution by Bergmann and Dirac.

A Hamiltonian formulation was considered at that time a necessary step towards

quantization: quantization had to proceed through the correspondence rules —which

were worked out also by Dirac in the 1920’s— that map the classical Poisson brackets

of the canonical variables into commutators of operators. Curiously enough, as a matter

of fact, it was at about the same time as Bergmann’s and Dirac’s ﬁrst contributions

to constrained systems, the end of the 1940’s, that Richard Feynman developed [9] the

path integral approach to quantization, which renders the route through the canonical
formalism basically unnecessary2 and restores the Lagrangian function to its privileged

role in deﬁning a Quantum (Field) Theory.

The diﬃculties that gauge theories pose to their own canonical formulation were al-

ready present in Electromagnetism, but in that case were somewhat circumvented in a

heuristic way by several methods of ﬁxing the gauge freedom [11] and by “ad hoc” modi-

1This “almost” is to be explained below.
2Note however that the derivation of the path integral formalism from the canonical approach is the
safest way to guarantee the unitarity of the S-matrix as well as the correct Feynman rules for some speciﬁc

theories [10].

ﬁcations of the Poisson brackets [12] —thus discovering the Dirac ones, “avant la lettre”.

But a diﬀeomorphism invariant theory like general relativity (GR) was not so easy to

tackle. Eventually, a general framework emerged, applicable to any particular case, that

yielded general results on the canonical formulation of gauge theories. It was mostly Dirac

who gave the ﬁnal form to the standard formulation of what has been called thereafter

Constrained Systems. His concise but immensely inﬂuential Yeshiva “Lectures on Quan-

tum Mechanics” (1963) [13] became the little book from which generations of theoretical

physicists learned the basics of Constrained Systems and were ﬁrst acquainted with the

key concepts of the formulation: constraints —primary, secondary, etc., in a terminol-

ogy coined by Bergmann; ﬁrst-class, second-class, in a diﬀerent classiﬁcation introduced

by Dirac—, canonical Hamiltonian, total Hamiltonian, extended Hamiltonian, arbitrary

functions, gauge transformations, Dirac bracket —substituting for the Poisson bracket—,

etc. The classical canonical formulation of GR, the ADM formalism [14], was obtained

also in the 1960s. An introductory as well as conceptual overview of Constrained Systems

and Dirac’s approach to gauge symmetries can be found in [15].

Let us mention at this point that one can ﬁnd in the literature other methods of

obtaining a canonical formulation for theories originating from singular Lagrangians. For

instance one can adopt the Faddeev-Jackiw method [16], which amounts to a classical

reduction of all the gauge degrees of freedom. The equivalence of this method with that

of Dirac and Bergmann was shown in [17]. Another method, which consists also in a

classical reduction of the gauge degrees of freedom, considers a quotienting procedure [18]

[19] [20] to obtain a physical phase space (endowed with a symplectic form) starting from

the presymplectic form that is deﬁned in the tangent bundle once the singular Lagrangian

is given. It was shown in [21] that this method is again equivalent to Dirac-Bergmann’s.

The main objective of this paper is to discuss and give a critical assessment of Dirac’s

approach to gauge transformations, and his consequent proposal to modify the dynamics

by the use of the extended Hamiltonian, instead of the one that is obtained from purely

mathematical considerations, the total Hamiltonian. Dirac only considered gauge trans-

formations at a given time, and this must be contrasted with the most common view of

gauge transformations as symmetries that map entire solutions of the dynamics into new

solutions, which was Bergmann’s point of view. We will try to clarify some confusions

4

originated from the use of these two diﬀerent concepts of gauge transformation.

In Section 2 we start with a brief, though almost self-contained, introductory Section

on Constrained Systems. In Section 3 we reproduce verbatim from [13] Dirac’s own view

on gauge transformations whereas in Section 4 we show the limitations of his approach

and complete it. We make contact with Bergmann’s view in Section 5.

In Section 6

we comment upon the incompleteness of Dirac view and its possible explanations.

In

Section 7 it is shown that Dirac’s modiﬁcation of the dynamics has, after all, no damaging

consequences. Finally we devote the last Section to some examples.

2 Dirac-Bergmann constrained systems in a nutshell

Although we are interested in gauge ﬁeld theories, we will use mainly the language of

mechanics —that is, of a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom—, which is suﬃcient for our

purposes. A quick switch to the ﬁeld theory language can be achieved by using DeWitt’s
[22] condensed notation. Consider, as our starting point3 a time-independent ﬁrst-order

Lagrangian L(q, ˙q) deﬁned in conﬁguration-velocity space T Q, that is, the tangent bundle

of some conﬁguration manifold Q that we assume to be of dimension n. Gauge theories rely

on singular —as opposed to regular— Lagrangians, that is, Lagrangians whose Hessian

matrix with respect to the velocities (where q stands, in a free index notation, for local

is not invertible (all our functions henceforth will be continuously diﬀerentiable as many

Wij ≡

∂2L
∂ ˙qi∂ ˙qj ,

(1)

coordinates in Q),

times as needed).

Two main consequences are drawn from this non-invertibility. First notice that the

Euler-Lagrange equations of motion [L]i = 0, with

[L]i := αi − Wij ¨qj ,

and

∂2L
∂ ˙qi∂qj ˙qj +
cannot be written in a normal form, that is, isolating on one side the accelerations,
¨qj = f j(q, ˙q). This makes the usual theorems about the existence and uniqueness of

∂L
∂qi ,

αi := −

3All functions are assumed to be continuous and diﬀerentiable as many times as the formalism requires.

5

solutions of ordinary diﬀerential equations inapplicable. Consequently, there may be

points in the tangent bundle where there are no solutions passing through the point, and

others where there is more than one solution. This is in fact our ﬁrst encounter with

constraints and the phenomenon of gauge freedom. Much more on this will be said below.

The second consequence of the Hessian matrix being singular concerns the construction

of the canonical formalism. The Legendre map from the tangent bundle T Q to the
cotangent bundle —or phase space— T ∗Q (we use the notation ˆp(q, ˙q) := ∂L

∂ ˙q ),

FL : T Q −→ T ∗Q

(q, ˙q) −→ (q, p = ˆp)

(2)

(3)

is no longer invertible because ∂ ˆp

∂ ˙q∂ ˙q is the Hessian matrix. There appears then an
issue about the projectability of structures from the tangent bundle to phase space: there

∂ ˙q = ∂L

will be functions deﬁned on T Q that cannot be translated (projected) to functions on

phase space. This feature of the formalisms propagates in a corresponding way to the

tensor structures, forms, vector ﬁelds, etc.

In order to better identify the problem and to obtain the conditions of projectability,

we must be more speciﬁc. We will make a single assumption, which is that the rank of

the Hessian matrix is constant everywhere. If this condition is not satisﬁed throughout

the whole tangent bundle, we will restrict our considerations to a region of it, with the

same dimensionality, where this condition holds. So we are assuming that the rank of the

Legendre map FL is constant throughout T Q and equal to, say, 2n − k. The image of FL

will be locally deﬁned by the vanishing of k independent functions, φµ(q, p), µ = 1, 2, .., k.
These functions are the primary constraints, and their pullback FL∗φµ to the tangent
bundle is identically zero:

(FL∗φµ)(q, ˙q) := φµ(q, ˆp) = 0, ∀ q, ˙q .

(4)

The primary constraints form a generating set of the ideal of functions that vanish on

the image of the Legendre map. With their help it is easy to obtain a basis of null vectors
for the Hessian matrix. Indeed, applying ∂

∂ ˙q to (4) we get

Wij

∂φµ
∂pj !|p= ˆp

 

= 0, ∀ q, ˙q .

6

With this result in hand, let us consider some geometrical aspects of the Legendre map.
We already know that its image in T ∗Q is given by the primary constraints’ surface. A

foliation in T Q is also deﬁned, with each element given as the inverse image of a point
in the primary constraints’ surface in T ∗Q. One can easily prove that the vector ﬁelds

tangent to the surfaces of the foliation are generated by

∂φµ
∂pj !|p= ˆp
The proof goes as follows. Consider two neighboring points in T Q belonging to the same

∂
∂ ˙qj .

Γµ =

(5)

 

sheet, (q, ˙q) and (q, ˙q + δ ˙q) (the conﬁguration coordinates q must be the same because

they are preserved by the Legendre map). Then, using the deﬁnition of the Legendre

map, we must have ˆp(q, ˙q) = ˆp(q, ˙q + δ ˙q), which implies, expanding to ﬁrst order,

∂ ˆp
∂ ˙q

δ ˙q = 0 ,

which identiﬁes δ ˙q as a null vector of the Hessian matrix (here expressed as ∂ ˆp

we already know a basis for such null vectors,

vector ﬁelds Γµ form a basis for the vector ﬁelds tangent to the foliation.

∂ ˙q ). Since
, µ = 1, 2, ..., k, it follows that the

∂φµ
∂pj

(cid:16)

|p= ˆp
(cid:17)

The knowledge of these vector ﬁelds is instrumental for addressing the issue of the
projectability of structures. Consider a real-valued function f L : T Q −→ R. It will —
locally— deﬁne a function f H : T ∗Q −→ R iﬀ it is constant on the sheets of the foliation,

that is, when

following way:

Γµf L = 0, µ = 1, 2, ..., k .

(6)

Equation (6) is the projectability condition we were looking for. We express it in the

Γµf L = 0, µ = 1, 2, ..., k ⇔ there exists f Hsuch that FL∗f H = f L .

2.1 The canonical Hamiltonian

A basic ingredient of the canonical formalism is the Hamiltonian function. In the case

of a regular theory (that is, with a non-singular Hessian matrix) it deﬁnes, by use of the

Poisson bracket, the vector ﬁeld that generates the time evolution —the dynamics— in

phase space. The Hamiltonian is given in that case as the projection to phase space of
the Lagrangian energy E = ∂L

∂ ˙q − L.

7

This procedure to deﬁne the Hamiltonian will still work in the singular case if the

energy satisﬁes the conditions of projectability (6).

Indeed we can readily check that

ΓµE = 0, so we have a canonical Hamiltonian Hc, deﬁned as a function on phase space
whose pullback is the Lagrangian energy, FL∗Hc = E. It was Dirac that ﬁrst realized in
the general setting of constrained systems that a Hamiltonian always existed.

There is a slight diﬀerence, though, from the regular case, for now there is an ambi-
guity in the deﬁnition of Hc. In fact, since FL∗φµ = 0, many candidates for canonical
Hamiltonians are available, once we are given one. In fact, Hc + vµφµ —with vµ(q, ˙q; t)
arbitrary functions and with summation convention for µ— is as good as Hc as a canonical

Hamiltonian. This “slight diﬀerence” is bound to have profound consequences: it is the

door to gauge freedom.

2.2 Dynamics for constrained systems

The Hamiltonian —with arbitrary functions— Hc + vµφµ was called by Dirac the total
Hamiltonian, although today it is usually referred to as the Dirac Hamiltonian HD.

In the regular case, once the Hamiltonian is given, the equations of motion in phase

space are deterministically formulated as

˙q = {q, Hc},

˙p = {p, Hc} .

So in the singular case we could try, taking into account the non-uniqueness of the canon-

ical Hamiltonian,

˙q = {q, HD} = {q, Hc} + vµ{q, φµ} ,

˙p = {q, HD} = {p, Hc} + vµ{p, φµ} ,

0 = φµ(q, p) .

(7)

(8)

Of course, as of now, this formulation (8) is just a reasonable guess. But it turns out

that it is correct in a very precise sense, as already shown by Dirac [4]. To be a bit more

precise, it was proven in [23] that the equations (8) are equivalent to the Euler-Lagrange

equations [L]i = 0. This is to say that if (q(t), p(t)) is a trajectory in phase space satisfying

(8), then q(t) is a solution of the Euler-Lagrange equations. And vice-versa, if q(t) is a
solution of the Euler-Lagrange equations, then the deﬁnition p(t) := ˆp(q(t), dq
dt ) makes
(q(t), p(t)) a solution of (8). Note that although the arbitrary functions vµ may depend

8

on the time and the phase space variables, on a given solution (q(t), p(t)) they become
just functions of the time variable. That is, assuming that the functions vµ are simply

arbitrary functions of time is suﬃcient in order to describe all solutions to the system (8).

So we have succeeded in obtaining a Hamiltonian formulation for a theory deﬁned

through a singular Lagrangian. It is worth noticing that the Hamiltonian equations of

motion have two parts, a diﬀerential one, corresponding to the ﬁrst two lines in (8),

and an algebraic one, which is the third line —the primary constraints. Both types of

equations are coupled in the sense that the constraints may impose severe restrictions

on the solutions of the diﬀerential equations —or even may prevent them from existing.

Dirac devised a clever way to disentangle the algebraic and diﬀerential components of

(8), which we are going to summarise in the next two subsections. Let is emphasize,

however, that the formulation of the dynamics is already complete in (8), and that the

developments below are just convenient elements for dealing with equations of the type

(8).

given by

2.3 Dirac’s classiﬁcation of constraints

The Hamiltonian time evolution vector ﬁeld, derived from the diﬀerential part in (8) is

XH :=

+ {−, Hc} + vµ{−, φµ},

(9)

∂
∂t

where vµ are arbitrary functions of time and we have introduced ∂

∂t to account for possible

explicit dependences on time.

Let us now examine the marriage between the algebraic and diﬀerential parts in (8).

First, we require the preservation in time of the primary constraints, that is, XHφµ = 0

on any trajectory solution of (8). These are tangency conditions that may lead to new
constraints and to the determination of some of the functions vµ. Here enters Dirac’s

clever idea of splitting the primary constraints in two types: those that are ﬁrst-class,

φµ0, and the rest, called second class, φµ1. They are deﬁned respectively by

{φµ0, φµ} =
pc

0 ,

and

det |{φµ1, φν1}| 6=
pc

0 ,

(10)

where {−, −} is as before the Poisson Bracket and pc stands for a generic linear combina-

tion of the primary constraints. The subscript pc under the sign of equality (or inequality)

means that such equality (or inequality) holds for all the points in phase space that lie

9

on the primary constraints’ surface. Let us mention the technical point that sometimes

the inequality above does not hold for every point; this fact rises the issue that some

constraints initially classiﬁed as second-class may eventually become ﬁrst-class when new

constraints appear in the formalism. We will not consider such a situation and will as-

sume henceforth that the determinant in (10) will be diﬀerent from zero everywhere on

the surface of primary constraints.

Note that the concept of a function being ﬁrst-class is not restricted to functions

representing constraints. In fact, we say that a function f is ﬁrst-class with respect to

a given set of constraints if its Poisson bracket with these constraints vanishes in the

constraints’ surface.

2.4 Reﬁning the dynamics

The requirement of the tangency of XH to the second class constraints ﬁxes some arbi-
trariness in the Hamiltonian dynamics. The arbitrary functions vν1 —where ν1 runs over
the indices of the secondary constraints— become determined as canonical functions vν1
c

0 = XHφµ1 = {φµ1, Hc} + vν1

c {φµ1, φν1} ,

(11)

through

which yields

c = −M µ1ν1{φν1, Hc} ,
vµ1

where M µ1ν1 is the matrix inverse of the Poisson bracket matrix of the primary second-

class constraints, {φµ1, φν1}.

Substituting vν1
c

for vν1 in (9) gives a more reﬁned expression for the dynamics:

X1

H :=

∂
∂t

+ {−, Hc}∗ + vµ0{−, φµ0} ,

(12)

where a new structure, the Dirac bracket, has been introduced, at this level of the primary

constraints, by the deﬁnition

{A, B}∗ := {A, B} − {A, φµ1}M µ1ν1{φν1, B} ,

Next we must require the dynamics to preserve the primary ﬁrst-class constraints φµ0.
The deﬁnition of the ﬁrst class property in (10) makes irrelevant the choice between the

10

initial form of the dynamics and the reﬁned form. For with either choice this requirement

ends up as the condition

{φν0, Hc} = 0 ,

on any solution of (8). If, for some ν0, the bracket {φν0, Hc} already gives zero on the
primary constraints’ surface, nothing new needs to be done, but if φ1
:= {φν0, Hc}
ν0
is diﬀerent from zero on that surface, it means that we have found new constraints that
further restrict the region where solutions to (8) may exist. These φ1

ν0 (for the appropriate

ν0’s) are called the secondary constraints [3].

Note that the evolutionary operator (12) can be alternatively expressed (taking into

account the fulﬁllment of the primary constraints) as

X1

H :=

∂
∂t

+ {−, H ∗

c } + vµ0{−, φµ0} ,

with H ∗

c itself a new canonical hamiltonian deﬁned by

H ∗

c := Hc − {Hc, φµ1}M µ1ν1φν1,

thus making the use of the Dirac bracket unnecessary.

Summing up, an initial analysis of the internal consistency of the system (8) has led

us to the equivalent system

˙q = {q, H ∗

˙p = {p, H ∗

c } + vµ0{q, φµ0} ,
c } + vµ0{p, φµ0} ,

0 = φµ(q, p)

0 = φ1

ν0(q, p) ,

which is a ﬁrst step in our endeavour to decouple the diﬀerential and the algebraic sides

in (8). In the language of the trade, we have undertaken the ﬁrst step in the stabilization

algorithm.

Now the way is paved for the next steps to be taken.

If new —i.e.

secondary—

constraints have been introduced in the ﬁrst step, we must ask again for the tangency of

the new evolution operator, (12) or (13), to them. This requirement may bring some of

the formerly primary ﬁrst-class constraints into the second-class category (thus producing

the determination of some of the remaining arbitrary functions) and, again, may give new

—tertiary— constraints. We will not dwell on the details, easily reconstructed, but just

11

(13)

(14)

(15)

mention that the application of the algorithm ends when we reach a ﬁnal constraint surface

to which the ﬁnal form of the time evolution vector ﬁeld is already tangent, so that no

more constraints appear and no more arbitrary functions get determined by consistency

requirements. This ﬁnal evolution vector ﬁeld will be written as

XF

H :=

+ {−, H ′} + vµ′

{−, φµ′} ,

∂
∂t

(16)

with H ′ the ﬁnal, ﬁrst-class, Hamiltonian4, and φµ′ the ﬁnal primary ﬁrst-class constraints.
So at this ﬁnal stage a certain set of constraints, primary, secondary, tertiary, etc.,

will restrict the region of phase space where a solution can exist. Let us denote these

generic constraints as φA, for some index A that will run through the whole set of primary,

secondary, tertiary, etc., constraints. So the ﬁnal picture of the dynamics will be expressed

with a system of equations equivalent to (8),

˙q = {q, H ′} + vµ′
˙p = {p, H ′} + vµ′

{q, φµ′} ,

{p, φµ′} ,

0 = φA(q, p) ,

(17)

the arbitrary functions associated with the ﬁnal primary ﬁrst-class constraints

with vµ′
φµ′.

Note the crucial diﬀerence between the initial equations (8) and the ﬁnal ones (17).
Since H ′ and φµ′ are ﬁrst-class with respect to the whole set of constraints φA, we only
need to choose the initial conditions —at, say, t = 0— (q(0), p(0)) in such a way that

the constraints are satisﬁed. Then, for whatever arbitrary functions we may use for
vµ′
satisfy the constraints. The diﬀerential and the algebraic sides in (17) are now completely

, the solution of the diﬀerential equations in the ﬁrst two lines in (17) will always

disentangled.

The presence of arbitrary functions in the ﬁnal form of the dynamics (17) signals the

existence of gauge freedom, which will be the subject of the next section. Note that there

may exist constrained systems (that is, systems described by singular Lagrangians) that

do not exhibit any gauge freedom, because all constraints eventually become second class.

That is why the phrases of “gauge theories” and “constrained systems” are not entirely

equivalent.

4Note that H ′ is a speciﬁc choice of a canonical Hamiltonian.

12

Finally, for further use, let us mention the notation invented by Dirac for the concepts

of weak (≈) and strong (≡) equalities, with respect to a set of constraints that we denote

generically by φ. A function f is said to be weakly equal to zero,

f ≈ 0 ,

f ≡ 0 ,

if it vanishes on the surface deﬁned by the constraints, f =
φ=0

0. A function f is said to

be strongly equal to zero,

if both f and its diﬀerential —that is, its partial derivatives ∂f

∂q , ∂f

∂p — vanish on the surface

deﬁned by the constraints, f =
φ=0

0, df =
φ=0

0.

3 Gauge freedom: Dirac’s view

As we said, when the ﬁnal equations (17) exhibit arbitrary functions in the dynamics,

the phenomenon of gauge freedom is present in our formulation, and there will exist

gauge transformations connecting diﬀerent solutions of (17) that share the same initial

conditions. From the mathematical point of view, the dynamics is no longer deterministic.

Now we will reproduce in literal terms Dirac’s analysis of gauge transformations. Let

us say at the outset that, as the title of this paper indicates, we shall eventually ﬁnd

this analysis incomplete; but in this Section we will accurately reproduce Dirac’s view

in his own words. Our comments will be reserved for the next section. The source here

will be exclusively the little book, [13], which was written when the theory of constrained

systems was settled enough, and which probably represents Dirac’s mature perspective

on the subject.

Dirac, verbatim:

“Let us try to get a physical understanding of the situation where we start with

given initial variables and get a solution of the equations of motion containing arbitrary

functions. The initial variables which we need are the q’s and the p’s. We don’t need to be

given initial values for the coeﬃcients v. These initial conditions describe what physicists

would call the initial physical state of the system. The physical state is determined only

by the q’s and the p’s and not by the coeﬃcients v.

13

Now the initial state must determine the state at later times. But the q’s and the

p’s at later times are not uniquely determined by the initial state because we have the

arbitrary functions v coming in. That means that the state does not uniquely determine

a set of q’s and p’s, even though a set of q’s and p’s uniquely determines a state. There

must be several choices of q’s and p’s which correspond to the same state. So we have

the problem of looking for all the sets of q’s and p’s that correspond to one particular

physical state.

All those values for the q’s and p’s at a certain time which can evolve from one initial

state must correspond to the same physical state at that time. Let us take particular

initial values for the q’s and the p’s at time t = 0, and consider what the q’s and the p’s

are after a short time interval δt. For a general dynamical variable g, with initial value

g0, its value at time δt is

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

g(δt) = g0 + δt ˙g

= g0 + δt {g, HT }

= g0 + δt({g, H ′} + va{g, φa}) .

The coeﬃcients v are completely arbitrary and at our disposal. Suppose we take
diﬀerent values, v′, for these coeﬃcients. That would give a diﬀerent g(δt), the diﬀerence

being

where

We may write this as

∆g(δt) = δt(v′a − va){g, φa} .

∆g(δt) = ǫa{g, φa} ,

ǫa = δt(v′a − va)

is a small arbitrary number, small because of the coeﬃcient δt and arbitrary because the
v’s and v′’s are arbitrary. We can change all our Hamiltonian variables in accordance with

the rule (20) and the new Hamiltonian variables will describe the same state. This change

in the Hamiltonian variables consists in applying an inﬁnitesimal contact transformation
with a generating function ǫaφa. We come to the conclusion that the φa’s, which appeared
in the theory in the ﬁrst place as the primary ﬁrst-class constraints, have this meaning:

as generating functions of inﬁnitesimal contact transformations, they lead to changes in

the q’s and the p’s that do not aﬀect the physical state.” ([13] p 20-21)

14

—————

[ Dirac next shows in extreme detail that applying, after ǫaφa, a second contact transfor-
mation γaφa, reversing the order and subtracting, and using the Jacobi identity for the
Poisson brackets, one gets

∆g = ǫaγb{g, {φa, φb}} ,

(22)

and then he infers that: ]

“This ∆g must also correspond to a change in the q’s and the p’s which does not involve

any change in the physical state, because it is made up by processes which individually

don’t involve any change in the physical state. Thus we see that we can use

{φa, φb}

(23)

as a generating function of an inﬁnitesimal contact transformation and it will still cause

no change in the physical state.

Now the φa are ﬁrst-class:

their Poisson brackets are weakly zero, and therefore

strongly equal to some linear function of the φ’s. This linear function of the φ’s must be

ﬁrst-class because of the theorem I proved a little while back, that the Poisson bracket of

two ﬁrst-class quantities is ﬁrst-class. So we see that the transformations which we get

this way, corresponding to no change in the physical state, are transformations for which

the generating function is a ﬁrst-class constraint. The only way these transformations are

more general than the ones we had before is that the generating functions which we had

before are restricted to be ﬁrst-class primary constraints. Those that we get now could be

ﬁrst-class secondary constraints. The result of this calculation is to show that we might

have a ﬁrst-class secondary constraint as a generating function of an inﬁnitesimal contact

transformation which leads to a change in the q’s and the p’s without changing the state.

For the sake of completeness, there is a little bit of further work one ought to do which
shows that a Poisson bracket {H ′, φa} of the ﬁrst-class hamiltonian with a ﬁrst-class φ is
again a linear function of ﬁrst-class constraints. This can also be shown to be a possible

generator for inﬁnitesimal contact transformation which do not change the state.

The ﬁnal result is that those transformations of the dynamical variables which do not

change physical states are inﬁnitesimal contact transformations in which the generating

function is a primary ﬁrst-class constraint or possibly a secondary ﬁrst-class constraint.

15

A good many of the secondary ﬁrst-class constraints turn up by the process (23) or as
{H ′, φa}. I think it may be that all the ﬁrst-class secondary constraints should be included
among the transformations which don’t change the physical state, but I haven’t been able

to prove it. Also, I haven’t found any example for which there exist ﬁrst-class secondary

constraints which do generate a change in the physical state.” ([13] p 22-23-24)

—————

“We were led to the idea that there are certain changes in the p’s and the q’s that do

not correspond to a change of state, and which have as generators ﬁrst-class secondary

constraints. That suggests that one should generalize the equations of motion in order to

allow as variations of a dynamical variable g with the time not only any variation given

by

but also any variation which does not correspond to a change of state. So we should

consider a more general equation of motion

with an extended Hamiltonian HE, consisting of the previous Hamiltonian HT , plus all

those generators that do not change the state, with arbitrary coeﬃcients:

Those generators φa′, which are not included already in HT , will be the ﬁrst-class sec-

ondary constraints. The presence of these further terms in the Hamiltonian will give

further changes in g, but these further changes in g do not correspond to any change of

state and so they should certainly be included, even though we did not arrive at these

further changes of g by direct work from the Lagrangian.” ([13] p 25)

“You notice that when we have passed over to the quantum theory, the distinc-

tion between primary constraints and secondary constraints ceases to be of any impor-

tance....Once we have gone over to the Hamiltonian formalism we can really forget about

the distinction between primary constraints and secondary constraints. The distinction

between ﬁrst-class and second-class constraints is very important.” ([13] f p 43)

4 Gauge freedom revisited:

the incompleteness of

Dirac’s view

The limitation of Dirac’s analysis is that he only examined the gauge transformations

in an inﬁnitesimal neighborhood of the initial conditions. This is shown by his using an

inﬁnitesimal parameter, that he took as δt, and an arbitrary function, which he took as
the diﬀerence va − v′a. Instead, we shall proceed to examine gauge transformations at

any value of the parameter t, that is, gauge transformations for the entire trajectory. The

inﬁnitesimal parameter will no longer be δt, but a new δs that describes an inﬁnitesimal

motion that maps a trajectory into another in such a way that points are mapped into
points corresponding to the same time. This new δs, times an arbitrary function f a, will
describe the diﬀerence v′a −va, which now is taken to be inﬁnitesimal. So the inﬁnitesimal

parameter and the arbitrary function appear together in

ǫa := v′a − va = δva = δs f a.

The two total Hamiltonians H ′ + vaφa and H ′ + v′aφa, diﬀer by an inﬁnitesimal arbitrary
function for any value of the time parameter t. This proposal goes beyond the scope of

Dirac’s work, which was circumscribed to an inﬁnitesimal neighborhood of the canonical

variables describing the trajectory at time t = 0.

We will see that when we complete the work by Dirac, the generators of gauge trans-
formations (mapping solutions into solutions) will be characterized5 by nice mathematical

expressions which, when restricted to the inﬁnitesimal region examined by Dirac, that is,

around the initial conditions, will reproduce his results.

Consider6 a dynamical trajectory generated by the total Hamiltonian HT = H ′ + vaφa
out of some initial conditions at t = 0. To emphasise the role of the arbitrary functions
va, let us use the notation gv(t) for it. This trajectory satisﬁes the equations of motion

˙gv(t) = {g, H ′}gv (t) + va{g, φa}gv (t) .

An inﬁnitesimally close trajectory, sharing the same initial conditions and generated by
H ′ + v′aφa, with v′ = va + δva, will be denoted by gv′. Let us deﬁne the variation

5We present a slightly modiﬁed derivation from that in [24].
6We keep using Dirac’s notation: H ′ is a ﬁrst-class canonical Hamiltonian and φa are the ﬁnal primary

ﬁrst-class constraints.

17

∆g = gv′ − gv, which is an equal-time variation, that is, ∆g(t) = gv′(t) − gv(t). Because

of that, this variation commutes with the time derivative,

[∆,

] = 0 .

d
d t

(24)

We shall make extensive use of this fact in the following.

First, notice that ∆g(t) can be conceived as the result of a chain of canonical trans-

formations: bringing gv(t) down to gv(0) = gv′(0) through the time evolution generated
by H ′ + vaφa (going backwards in time) and then up to gv′(t) using H ′ + v′aφa. Therefore
∆g(t) is an inﬁnitesimal canonical transformation that can be written as

∆g(t) = {g, G(t)}gv

(25)

for some function G(t)7 in phase space, that is, a function G(q, p; t). Note that a change
of the coeﬃcient functions va will also produce changes in G(t). Since the vector ﬁeld

{−, G(t)} generates a map from solutions into solutions, it must preserve the constraints

of the theory, therefore G(t) is ﬁrst-class function.

Now let us use (24) to compute ∆ ˙g in two diﬀerent ways (we use v′a = va + δva and

keep terms up to ﬁrst order in δva).

First way

7Observe that G(t) is hiding an inﬁnitesimal factor δs which for the sake of simplicity we do not make

explicit.

Poisson brackets leads to

At any time, the point gv(t) in phase space, for a generic dynamical trajectory gv,

can be any point on the surface of constraints. Thus, freed from a speciﬁc trajectory, the

contents of the previous expression is just the weak equality

{g,

∂ G
∂ t

+ {G, HT } − δva φa} ≈ 0 .

The variable g represents any canonical variable, therefore the last expression is equivalent

to the strong equality

∂ G

for some function f that depends exclusively on the time parameter t. A trivial redeﬁnition

makes this function disappear without aﬀecting (25). We obtain, with the redeﬁned G,

Recall that the δva’s are arbitrary inﬁnitesimal functions, and the φa’s are the primary
ﬁrst-class constraints (pfcc). Then (26) can be alternatively written with no mention to
the δva’s,

+ {G, HT } ≡ pfcc .

Finally, recalling that HT = H ′ + vaφa and that the functions va are arbitrary as well,

(30)

Note that putting pc (primary constraints) instead of pfcc in (29) and (30) would have

been suﬃcient because the ﬁrst class condition in these equations is already guaranteed
by (28) taken together with the fact that H ′ and φa are ﬁrst class.

Let us brieﬂy comment on our result. We have found that, in addition to being ﬁrst-

class, G is a constant of motion for the dynamics generated by HT , for any values of the
arbitrary functions va. This is just the meaning of (29) and (30). It is a constant of motion

of a very speciﬁc type, as is seen directly in (27). One must notice that, in contrast with

the case of regular theories, Dirac-Bergmann constrained systems have diﬀerent types of

constants of motion, according to the status of what appears in the right side of (27). For

instance, if instead of the strong equality to a linear combination of primary ﬁrst-class

constraints, we had a strong or weak equality to any constraint, we still would have a

constant of motion, but if (27) is not satisﬁed, it will not generate a gauge transformation.

But in fact our result goes beyond the consideration of gauge transformations. We

have just found the conditions for G(t) in (25) to generate a symmetry, either rigid

or gauge. Any object G satisfying the three conditions above is a canonical generator

of a symmetry of the dynamics, that maps solutions into solutions. These symmetries

may depend on arbitrary functions (more on this below) and then will be called gauge

symmetries (or gauge transformations). If they do not depend on arbitrary functions they

will be called rigid symmetries. What we have found in the three conditions (28),(29),(30)

is the characterization of the generators of symmetries in phase space that are canonical

transformations.

It is worth noticing that conditions (28),(29),(30) come very close to saying that G is

a Noether conserved quantity, thus generating a Noether symmetry through (25). Indeed

this would have been the case if our theory had been deﬁned by a regular Lagrangian, and

not by a singular one. But in gauge systems, Noether theory has some speciﬁc features.

Let us just mention that the characterisation of a conserved quantity that generates a
Noether symmetry projectable from tangent space to phase space8 is given [30] by the

{G, pc} = pc .

(31)

(32)

Note that the fulﬁllment of (31),(32) makes G ﬁrst class. Equations (31),(32), are more

restrictive than (28),(29),(30) in three ways. (1) The strong equality there is replaced here

by an ordinary equality. (2) In (32) the Hamiltonian is the canonical one, Hc, which, unlike
H ′, is not necessarily ﬁrst-class. (3) In the Poisson bracket in (32) all primary constraints

appear in the lhs, and not only those that are ﬁrst-class.

5 Bergmann’s version of gauge transformations

Probably inspired by the examples of electromagnetism, where the gauge transformation

of the gauge potential is

δAµ = {Aµ, G} = ∂µΛ ,

for an arbitrary function Λ, and general relativity, where the gauge transformations (dif-

feomorphisms) for the metric ﬁeld read

δgµν = ǫρ∂ρgµν + gµρ∂νǫρ + gρν∂µǫρ ,

(for some arbitrary functions ǫρ), Bergmann and Anderson [3] conceived a gauge trans-

formation in a general ﬁeld theory as (ΦA representing any ﬁeld or ﬁeld component)

δΦA = fAξ + f µ

A∂µξ + f µν

A ∂µν ξ + . . . ,

where ξ(xµ) is an arbitrary function of the space-time coordinates and ∂µ stands for the
partial derivatives. In our formulation of canonical generators, and restricting ourselves

to the language of mechanics rather than that of ﬁeld theory, this will correspond to an

ansatz of the form [31]

G(t) = G0ξ(t) + G1 ˙ξ(t) + G2 ¨ξ(t) + . . . =

Giξ(i)(t) ,

(33)

N

Xi=0
to phase space. This case has been discussed in [26], see also [27, 28, 29].

21

with ξ an arbitrary function of the time parameter and with Gi functions of the canonical

variables, to be determined. We have assumed that a ﬁnite number of terms will suﬃce.

Let us plug this ansatz into (29),(30) and take into account the arbitrariness of ξ. We

get, from (30),

and from (29),

{Gi, φa} ≡ pfcc , i = 0, . . . , N.

{G0, H ′} ≡ pfcc ,

GN ≡ pfcc .

Gi−1 ≡ {Gi, H ′} + pfcc, i = 1, . . . , N.

(34)

(35)

(36)

(37)

The intuitive idea behind these expressions is quite clear: the last one sets GN to be

a primary ﬁrst-class constraint (up to pieces quadratic in the constraints). Next, using

the iteration in (36), GN −1 is found to be a secondary ﬁrst-class constraint (up to pfcc

pieces), and so on, until we reach G0, which is required to satisfy (35), that puts a stop

to the stabilisation algorithm.

In addition, every Gi must satisfy (34). It is by no means trivial to prove that there

exist solutions for the ansatz (33). This existence was proved in [32] under just the

conditions a) that the rank of the Hessian matrix is constant, b) that the constraints that

are initially second-class, remain always so under the stabilisation algorithm, and c) that
no ineﬀective constraints9 appear in the theory.

So let us suppose that these conditions are met and that a gauge generator of the

form (33) exists. This generator is made up of ﬁrst-class constraints, so it automatically

satisﬁes the ﬁrst requirement (28), and therefore all three requirements (28),(29),(30) are

fulﬁlled. In addition, since it is a combination of constraints, the value of G as a conserved
quantity is zero10.

Now let us try to recover the results of Dirac. He considered a gauge transformation

acting at time δt and which at time t = 0 did not produce any change because it preserved
9A constraint is said to be ineﬀective if its diﬀerential vanishes on the constraints’ surface. See [25],

section 2, for further considerations.

10This assertion needs a prompt qualiﬁcation in ﬁeld theory because of possible contributions from the
spatial boundary in the deﬁnition of a conserved charge from a conserved current, as happens in GR [33]

[34] [35] [36] [37].

22

the initial conditions. Since

δg(t) = {g, G(t)} =

{g, Gi} ξ(i)(t) ,

(38)

i=N

Xi=0

we must impose ξ(i)(0) = 0, i = 0, . . . , N, in order to guarantee δg(0) = 0 for generic

constraints Gi. Then, at an inﬁnitesimal time δt, and to ﬁrst order in δt,

ξ(i)(δt) = ξ(i)(0) + δt ξ(i+1)(0), i = 0, . . . , N ,

(39)

thus implying, to this order,

ξ(i)(δt) = 0, i = 0, . . . , N − 1 ; ξ(N )(δt) = δt ξ(N +1)(0) ,

(40)

where the value of ξ(N +1)(0) is arbitrary. The choice ξ(N +1)(0) = v′ − v, where v′ − v is
v′a − va as in (21) but for a ﬁxed a —corresponding to a single gauge transformation—,
produces (ǫ = δt(v′ − v), see (21))

δg(δt) = ǫ {g, GN } ,

(41)

which is, recalling from (37) that GN is a pfcc, Dirac’s result (20). Here it has been

obtained as a ﬁrst order computation in δt, which was exactly Dirac’s starting point.

Now we are ready to connect the concept of a gauge transformation as a map of

solutions into solutions, which is Bergmann’s view, with Dirac’s concept of a gauge trans-

formation at a given time, which can be understood as mapping a set of initial conditions

into a gauge equivalent set. In view of equation (33), it is clear that the full generator of

a gauge transformation, G(t), is equivalent to a set of diﬀerent, independent generators

of gauge transformations at a given time. It suﬃces to consider that, at any ﬁxed time t0,
the quantities ξ(i)(t0) are just independent numerical quantities (remember that ξ(t) was
an arbitrary function), and therefore the functions Gi become independent generators of

gauge transformations at a given time.

6 Comments

Notice that if we expand to second order in δt the previous expressions, the role of

the secondary ﬁrst-class constraints emerges. This was probably the idea of Dirac in

23

the paragraph reproduced above: “For the sake of completeness, there is a little bit or
further work one ought to do which shows that a Poisson bracket {H ′, φa} of the ﬁrst-class
hamiltonian with a ﬁrst-class φ is again a linear function of ﬁrst-class constraints. This

can also be shown to be a possible generator for inﬁnitesimal contact transformation which

do not change the state”.

It is very curious, to say the least, that such a relevant argument, purely mathematical,

does not appear more elaborated in Dirac’s book, in contrast with his previous argument,

also reproduced in section 3, where it is shown in detail that the Poisson bracket of two

primary ﬁrst-class constraints must be still a generator of gauge transformations at a

given time. This argument, which is just mentioned with a concise can also be shown, is

crucial to understanding the origin of the incompleteness of Dirac’s analysis, because it

could have been used to show that one does not need to modify the dynamics in order to

ensure that all ﬁrst-class constraints are allowed to generate gauge transformations at a

given time. At this point Dirac seems to think of his argument as physical rather than

mathematical, and so he is led to believe that the preservation, and pre-eminence, of the

physical interpretation makes it necessary to artiﬁcially modify the dynamics.

Let us rephrase our main point. Dirac attempted to carefully distinguish the math-

ematical and the physical aspects of the formulation. On the other hand, he was con-

vinced that a physically conceived gauge transformation at a given time, in order to be

mathematically recognised as such, should have its generator explicitly appearing in the

Hamiltonian, with its corresponding Lagrangian multiplier. Otherwise there would have

been something wrong with the formalism. His thinking in this respect is clearly stated

in the third paragraph reproduced in section 3. Then, in view of the fact that there

could be secondary ﬁrst-class constraints generating gauge transformations at a given

time, and that they were not present in the total Hamiltonian, he proposed the extended

Hamiltonian as the true generator of time evolution, to prevent the formalism from any

contradiction. Thus, being afraid of an inconsistency between the mathematical formal-

ism and its physical interpretation, Dirac proposed to modify the dynamics through the

introduction of the Extended Hamiltonian. Considering in his view the subsidiary role

of mathematics, and in full agreement with his approach to these disciplines [38], he put

physical intuition ﬁrst. Regretfully he did so in this case based on an incomplete analysis.

Now, completion of his analysis shows that there is no tension whatsoever between the

mathematical description and the physical content of gauge transformations, and that his

24

proposal for the Extended Hamiltonian was totally unnecessary.

On the technical side we observe that, in constructing a gauge transformation, Dirac

looked for an inﬁnitesimal transformation containing an arbitrary function. The arbi-

trariness he found in the functions v (see (21)), whereas the inﬁnitesimality he took from

the time evolution, δt. This last step in his construction is responsible for the essential

incompleteness of his analysis, because a gauge transformation at a given time should not

have used the time as the governing parameter of the transformation.

A complementary argument was also developed by Dirac. Since there is always a

mathematical jump in the process of quantization of a classical system, he conceived

that although from the classical perspective, the classiﬁcation of primary, secondary, etc.

constraints was relevant, the quantization of the system made this nomenclature useless

and for quantization the only useful concepts were those of ﬁrst-class and second-class

constraints. He made his point very clear in the last paragraph reproduced in Section

3. Obviously a Hamiltonian including only the primary ﬁrst-class constraints was at

odds with this new way of thinking, and the extended Hamiltonian was a remedy for it.

It seems likely that these considerations helped Dirac in deciding to depart from what

he thought was deducible from the pure mathematics of the system and to artiﬁcially

introduce an ad hoc modiﬁcation of the dynamics. In Dirac’s view, therefore, the argument

concerning the preservation of the physical interpretation of gauge transformations at a

given time, against the purely mathematical interpretation (that, as we insist, he thought

were mutually inconsistent), gets somewhat mixed with arguments concerning the process

of quantization of a constrained classical system.

Dirac only dealt with gauge transformations at a given time, which can be taken as

the time for the setting of the initial conditions. But the most common view of a gauge

transformation is that of Bergmann: a symmetry that maps entire solutions (or solutions

deﬁned in a region of phase space) of the dynamics into new solutions. The misunderstand-

ings created by the confusion between both concepts have been enormous. Indeed many

authors take for granted from Dirac that ﬁrst-class constraints generate gauge transfor-

mations without even making the distinction between Dirac’s and Bergmann’s concepts.

As explained in the last paragraph of the preceding section, the diﬀerence between both

concepts is neatly displayed when the complete analysis of the generators of gauge trans-

25

formations is performed.

Let us ﬁnally say a few words on the so-called Dirac’s conjecture. In fact, one should

clearly distinguish between Dirac’s formulation of a conjecture, namely, that all ﬁrst-

class constraints generate gauge transformations at a given time, and what he thought

—wrongly in our understanding— to be a compulsory consequence of the assumption of

this conjecture: the necessity of modifying the dynamics. The conjecture can be proved

[32] under the same assumptions that guarantee the existence of gauge transformations,

already spelled out in Section 5. Examples of the failure of this conjecture for some

“pathological” models, as well as other considerations on the formalism for these models,

have been widely discussed in the literature [39].

7 Saving the day: 1) observables; 2) quantization in

the operator formalism

If Dirac’s approach to gauge transformations was so incomplete, and his proposal to

modify the dynamics so gratuitous and unfounded, one may wonder to what extent has

it aﬀected the correct development and applications of the theory. The answer is: very

little, and for various reasons.

First, because of the concept of observables, which will be the subject of the following

paragraph. Second, because Dirac’s method of quantisation in the operator formalism can

be introduced either with the total Hamiltonian or with the extended Hamiltonian with

equivalent results. A third reason is that important developments, for instance the most

powerful theoretical tool for the quantization of constrained systems, the ﬁeld-antiﬁeld

formalism [40] (see [41] for a general review), did not incorporate these controversial
features of Dirac’s view11.

Indeed, the natural concept of gauge transformations —as
11In [42] a mixed approach is taken. The authors of [42] ﬁrst assume Dirac’s analysis and consider
the extended Hamiltonian formalism, on the grounds —see below— that quantization in the operator

formalism only distinguishes between constraints of ﬁrst or second class. But the authors are able to make

contact with the standard gauge transformations —mapping solutions into solutions— by considering the

combinations of the extended Hamiltonian gauge transformations —generated independently by the ﬁrst

class constraints— that are compatible with setting to zero in the extended Hamiltonian the Lagrange

multipliers associated with the secondary ﬁrst-class constraints. Clearly the total Hamiltonian formalism

and its gauge transformations are recovered. The authors consider the generalization of taking the

26

Noether symmetries of the action— to be used in a path-integral framework is that of

mapping trajectories into trajectories (or ﬁeld conﬁgurations into ﬁeld conﬁgurations).

Let us give some details about the ﬁrst two reasons.

In the classical setting, an observable is deﬁned as a function that is gauge invariant.

Consider a time dependent observable O(t) (the dependence with respect to the phase

space variables exists, but is not made explicit) and consider for simplicity that there is

only one gauge transformation in the formalism, whose gauge generator is of the form

(33), that is

N

G(t) =

Giξ(i)(t) ,

Xi=0
with Gi being ﬁrst-class constraints. In fact they are all the ﬁrst-class constraints of the

theory if the conditions mentioned in Section 5 are met.

Thus, O(t) being an observable means that the equal-time Poisson bracket between

O(t) and G(t) vanishes:

{O(t), G(t)} = 0

(strictly speaking, this vanishing of the Poisson bracket needs only to hold on the surface

deﬁned by the constraints). But, having in mind the expansion of G(t) above and the

arbitrariness of the function ξ(t), this is equivalent to the vanishing of the Poisson bracket

of O(t) with respect to all the ﬁrst-class constraints,

{O(t), Gi} = 0 , ∀ i.

The immediate consequence is that the dynamical evolution of O(t) is deterministic and

that in this respect it is irrelevant whatever we use the total Hamiltonian HT or the

extended Hamiltonian HE. Indeed

dO
dt

=

∂O
∂t

+ {O, HT } =

+ {O, HE} .

∂O
∂t

Since we can only attach physical signiﬁcance to the gauge invariant functions, it is clear

the Dirac’s proposal of the extended Hamiltonian is harmless, as far as observables are

concerned. This key result ﬁnally saves the day for Dirac’s proposal.

A similar argument can be applied to Dirac’s quantization in the operator formalism,

where the physical states must be gauge invariant. Let us denote a generic Schrodinger

remaining Lagrange multipliers as new independent variables. This approach has been extended in [27].

27

physical state at time t by |ψ(t) >. If the ﬁrst-class constraints Gi can be expressed as
linear quantum operators ˜Gi, still remaining ﬁrst class, where this is understood in terms
of the commutator of operators instead of the Poisson bracket, and being stable under

the quantum Hamiltonian, then the gauge invariance property of the physical states at a

given time becomes

˜Gi|ψ(t) >= 0 , ∀ i .

(42)

So we end up with the requirement that all ﬁrst-class constraints must be enforced as

operators on the quantum state at any time on an equal footing, regardless whether they

were primary or not —which was Dirac’s idea. Second-class constraints in Dirac formalism

are used to eliminate pairs of canonical variables before the process of quantisation is

undertaken.

Notice that equations (42) have naturally led us to identify the gauge invariance prop-

erty of the states with the implementation of the ﬁrst-class constraints as quantum oper-

ators acting on them and giving a vanishing eigenvalue. The diﬀerence with the classical

picture is noticeable, because the classical trajectories satisfying the constraints are not

gauge invariant and further elimination of gauge degrees of freedom is needed, for instance

through a gauge ﬁxing procedure. Thus the two issues of a) satisfying the constraints and

b) being gauge invariant, which are diﬀerent from the classical point of view, become

identical in the operational quantum picture. This is the origin of the quantum problem

of time [43] [44] for generally covariant systems, for which the Hamiltonian is a ﬁrst class

constraint.

8 Examples

Finally, we illustrate our discussion with two examples.

8.1 The free relativistic particle with auxiliary variable

The relativistic massive free particle model with auxiliary variable is a good example for

our purposes. It is described by the Lagrangian

L =

˙xµ ˙xνηµν −

em2,

1
2e

1
2

(43)

28

where xµ is the vector variable in Minkowski spacetime, with metric (ηµν) = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1).
The parameter m is the mass and the auxiliary variable e can be interpreted, in the stan-

dard language of canonical general relativity, as a lapse function, the world-line metric
Its own equation of motion determines e = (− ˙xµ ˙xµ)1/2,
being deﬁned by g00 = −e2.
and substitution of this value into the Lagrangian12 leads to the free particle Lagrangian
Lf = − m
2 (− ˙xµ ˙xµ)1/2. Equation (43) is analogous to the Polyakov Lagrangian for the
bosonic string, where the components of the world-sheet metric are auxiliary variables.

Substitution of their dynamically determined values yields the Nambu-Goto Lagrangian,

analogous to Lf .

The following Noether gauge transformation is well-known to describe the repara-

metrisation invariance for this Lagrangian (δL = d

dt (ǫL)):

δxµ = ǫ ˙xµ, δe = ǫ ˙e + ˙ǫe.

(44)

Here ǫ is an inﬁnitesimal arbitrary function of the evolution parameter t. There is a

primary constraint π ≈ 0, where π is the variable conjugate to e. The only vector ﬁeld in

(5) is now Γ = ∂/∂ ˙e. The condition that a function f in conﬁguration-velocity space be

projectable to phase space is

∂f
∂ ˙e
The Noether transformation (44) is not projectable to phase space, since Γδe 6= 0. Pro-

Γf =

= 0.

jectable transformations are of the form:

The Noether variations then become:

The arbitrary function describing the Noether gauge transformation is now ξ(t).

The canonical Hamiltonian is

(45)

(46)

where pµ is the variable canonically conjugate to xµ. The evolution operator vector ﬁeld
{−, H} + λ(t){−, π} yields the secondary constraint 1
2 (pµpµ + m2) ≈ 0. Both the primary

and the secondary constraints are ﬁrst class. The arbitrary function λ is a reﬂection of

the gauge invariance of the model. The solutions of the equations of motion are:

xµ(t) = xµ(0) + pµ(0)

Z

pµ(t) = pµ(0),

π(t) = π(0),

with the initial conditions satisfying the constraints.

The canonical generator of gauge transformations, satisfying (28),(29) and (30), is

G = ξ(t)

(pµpµ + m2) + ˙ξ(t)π .

(47)

Gauge transformations relate trajectories obtained through diﬀerent choices of λ(t).

Consider an inﬁnitesimal change λ → λ+δλ. Then the change in the trajectories (keeping

the initial conditions intact) is:

δxµ(t) = pµ(0)

which is nothing but a particular case of the projectable gauge transformations displayed

above with

ξ(t) =

Notice that the structure of the gauge generator (47) is that of (33). It is only this

particular combination of primary and secondary ﬁrst-class constraints that generates

gauge transformations mapping solutions to solutions.

8.2 Maxwell theory

The case of pure electromagnetism is described with the Lagrangian

LM = −

FµνF µν ,

1
4

30

where Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ and Aµ is the Maxwell gauge ﬁeld. We take again the metric

in Minkowski spacetime as (ηµν) = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1). The canonical Hamiltonian is

Hc =

dx

(~π2 + ~B2) + ~π · ∇A0

,

1
2

(cid:20)

Z

(cid:21)

where the electric ﬁeld ~π stands for the spatial components of πµ, the variables canonically
conjugate to Aµ. The Lagrangian deﬁnition of πµ is ˆπµ = −F 0µ and so π0 is a primary
constraint, π0 ≈ 0. The magnetic ﬁeld is deﬁned as Bi = 1
2ǫijkF jk. Stability of the
constraint π0 under the Hamiltonian dynamics leads to the secondary constraint ˙π0 =
{π0, Hc} = ∇ · ~π ≈ 0. Both constraints are ﬁrst-class and no more constraints arise.
Now, similarly to the previous example, the gauge generator takes the form

G[t] =

d3x

Z

− ˙Λ(x, t) π0(x, t) + Λ(x, t) ∇·~π(x, t)
h

i

with Λ(x, t) an arbitrary scalar function of the space-time coordinates. The gauge trans-

formation of the gauge ﬁeld is then

δAµ = {Aµ, G} = −∂µΛ ,

which is the usual Noether U(1) symmetry for the Lagrangian LM . Let us observe again

that a primary and a secondary constraint are necessary to build the gauge generator.

Notice also that the particular combination of both constraints, together with the role

of the function Λ and its time derivative, eventually ensures that the gauge ﬁeld Aµ

transforms covariantly.

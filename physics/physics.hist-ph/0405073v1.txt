Coins of Armenian king Tigranes the Great clearly reveal a star with a
tail on the royal tiara which may be associated with the Halley’s passage of
87 BC.

Tigranes II the Great (95-55 BC) had made Armenia one of powerful
kingdoms in Western Asia, extending from the Caucasus to the eastern
Mediterranean. The economical needs and the expansion of the empire re-
sulted in diverse silver and copper-bronze coinage. Though the chronological
and mint problems of abundant emissions of Tigranes’ coins have been dis-
cussed by scholars, many questions remain unclear. On the prevailing part of
the coins Tigranes wears a tiara decorated with a sun/star symbol between
two eagles. This concerns the tetradrachms struck in Antioch in Syria, as
well as the silver and bronze coins struck in Artaxata or Tigranocerta. On
the tetradrachms and copper-bronze coins struck in Damascus, the king’s
tiara is adorned with a big sun/star symbol on the left side along with an
eagle-like symbol to the right.

On a rare series of tetradrachms and drachms and on more numerous
copper coins (Figs.1,2) depicting the goddesses Tyche and Nike, cypress
tree, palm branch, tripod on their reverse, Tigranes’ tiara is decorated with
a single star, one of the right side rays of which is longer and curved, which
can be interpreted as a comet [1]. The king looks younger on these coins.
This latter series is the most mysterious in the entire Tigranes’ coinage
regarding its dating, mint place, as well as the interpretation of the comet’s
symbol.

All silver coins of Tigranes, except for the Damascus series and a large
group of bronze coins, on their reverse have a goddess sat on a rock, wearing
a turreted crown, holding a palm branch and having a swimming nude ﬁgure
of a river-god at her feet. The scholars have no doubts that this represents
the bronze statue of the city goddess Tyche, created by Eutychides, the
disciple of Lissipe, and erected in Antioch long ago, at the time of Seleucus
I (312-280). Tigranes conquered this famous Seleucid city in 83 BC. This
fact is commonly agreed, as is based on a passage from Appian, as well as

on the coins struck until this year in Antioch by the Seleucid king Antiochus
X.

Hence, the series with comet has to be struck after the above-mentioned
date. Among the astronomical records of the period corresponding the reign
of Tigranes is the appearance of Halley’s comet. According to the chronicles
and modern backward orbit computations, Halley passed the perihelion on
August 6, 87 BC, being discovered in July and was last seen on August 24
[2].

Chinese chronicles of Han Shu (see [2]) mention also a comet in 84 BC,
three astronomical events in 69 BC: ’a sparkling star’ seen during January
27 - February 24, 69 BC, probably a nova, a guest star observed in July 22,
and another guest star discovered on August 20 and last seen on August 27.
Another sparkling star is attributed to 61 BC.

Since there is no reason to consider the image on Tigranes’ tiara as a
stylized symbol of a comet, and it has to be attributed to a speciﬁc comet,
then the Halley shown up within his reign has to be the most recordable
event. If so, one has another case when astronomical events can be useful also
for historical chronological problems [3],[4], and this would be a far earlier
record of Halley in Armenia than was previously known from chronicles [5].
The curved (not straight) tail clearly visible on the coins also can act as
comet’s distinguishing information.

We thank Aram Gurzadyan for help in the preparation of images.

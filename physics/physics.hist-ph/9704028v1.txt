THE THIRD WAY TO QUANTUM MECHANICS IS
THE FORGOTTEN FIRST

by Salvatore ANTOCI1 and Dierck-E. LIEBSCHER2

accepted by Annales de la Fondation Louis de Broglie

Abstract

Quantum mechanics can be formulated in three ways, as Heisenberg, Schr¨odinger and
Feynman did respectively. For the last way, an unknown (i.e. forgotten) forerunner exists,
that we have found in a paper by Gregor Wentzel, published before the famous works
by Heisenberg and Schr¨odinger, and contemporary with the fundamental works of L. de
Broglie. In that paper, one can ﬁnd the basic formulae and their interpretation as they were
adopted by Feynman twenty years later. We believe that Wentzel’s work was forgotten for
several reasons: (I) Schr¨odinger’s equation was much simpler to deal with (Wentzel himself
contributed to its development in the same way as L.Brillouin and H.Kramers did). (II)
The ﬁrst application was rejected by Heisenberg and Kramers. (III) The approximation
used by Wentzel was too na¨ıve and failed. Nevertheless, the foundation laid by Wentzel was
sound, as it has been shown by Feynman’s work. Therefore, Wentzel has to be considered
as one of the founders of quantum mechanics.
Our exposition aims at explaining some details. It is accompanied by two appendices.
They respectively provide a summary of the quoted paper by Wentzel and of the the-
ory of canonical transformations, needed to understand the link between Wentzel’s and
Feynman’s formulations.

La m´ecanique quantique peut ˆetre introduit par trois chemins, celui de Heisenberg, celui
de Schr¨odinger, et celui de Feynman. Pour le dernier, il existe un pr´ecurseur inconnu,
c’est-`a-dire oubli´e, que nous avons trouv´e ´a un travail de Gregor Wentzel, publi´e avant des

de L.deBroglie. On y peut trouver les formules fondamentales et leur interpretation us´ees
par Feynman vingt ans apr`es. Nous croyons que le travail de Wentzel a ´et´e oubli´e par
plusieurs raisons. Premi`erement, l’´equation de Schr¨odinger ´etait plus simple `a analyser
(Wentzel mˆeme contribuait `a ce developpement contemporainement avec L.Brillouin et
H.Kramers). Secondement, l’application premi`ere fˆut r´ejet´ee par Heisenberg et Kramers.
Troisi`emement, l’approximation us´ee par Wentzel ´etait trop simple et faillit. N´eanmoins,
la fondation par Wentzel ´etait correcte, comme les travaux de Feynman ont montr´es.
Par cons´equence, il faut apprecier Wentzel comme un des fondateurs de la m´ecanique
quantique.
Notre exposition veut expliquer quelques d´etails. Elle est accompagn´ee par deux annexes,

1 Introduction

Traditionally, we teach about three ways to quantum mechanics, attributed to Heisenberg
[33, 5, 4, 20], Schr¨odinger [52, 53, 55, 56], and Feynman [30].

In the Heisenberg picture, Hilbert-space operators are substituted for the classical vari-
ables, and these operators may be represented by matrices. The classical canonical equations
of motion are translated by the correspondence [20] between the Poisson bracket and the
commutator into

The state of the system in question is represented by a ﬁxed Hilbert vector, which is not nec-
essarily made explicit, if the representation is produced by the matrix elements themselves.

The central issue of the Schr¨odinger approach is the equation of motion for a state Hilbert

vector, whose representation in the function space L2 is the wave function ψ[x, t]:

and it is used to calculate the distribution of the measured classical variables. Eigenstates
to the Hamilton operator characterize stationary states. The approach is equivalent to that
of Heisenberg [54].

The third method was published more than twenty years later by Feynman [30, 28]. It
aims at the immediate calculation of transition probabilities, which later on can be translated
into the expressions for a corresponding wave function. In this picture, transitions are given
by a set of mediating trajectories in conﬁguration or phase space, each contributing to the
phase of a Hilbert vector, whose squared amplitude is the desired probability. The phase of
an individual path is the classical action integral, and one obtains

with the transition contribution

The total amplitude is the sum of the interfering contributions, formally

(qA|qE) =

Dq[t] exp[

L[qi, ˙qi, t]dt] .

With a suitable choice of K, this relation is equivalent, in simple examples, to Schr¨odinger’s
equation ([30], eq.18). The main point of Feynman’s approach is the notion of interference
of paths, not the mere equivalence of a mechanical path through conﬁguration space with
transversals to the surfaces3 of constant S. The mathematics of the integration over paths
is a problem in its own right [46, 31, 1].

Feynman cites suggestions and remarks of Dirac [21, 22, 23], which are taken as hints to
use a kind of Huygens’ principle to evaluate the evolution in time of the quantum-mechanical
wave function. He – and all followers – did not cite nor recognize an early work by Gregor
Wentzel [63], where exactly the formulas written later by Feynman are derived with the
aim of obtaining the characteristics of wave propagation by techniques of point mechanics.
Wentzel’s paper reached the editor of Zeitschrift f¨ur Physik on February 2nd, 1924. It is the
ﬁrst paper which describes a method like Feynman’s to construct transition probabilities.
This method was not applied in full [64, 65]. Nevertheless, the method was appropriate, and
proven to be manageable by Feynman. Thus, Wentzel’s paper should be acknowledged in
the history of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg’s famous article on matrix mechanics dates
from July 29th, 1925 [33], and is clearly second to Wentzel’s. Schr¨odinger published about
the quantum wave equation from January 27th, 1926 on [52, 53, 55, 56]. Only DeBroglie
wrote about matter waves already in september 1923 [15, 16, 17], prior to G.Wentzel.

In the following, we ﬁrst intend to sketch the derivation used by Wentzel, and secondly, we
will conjecture about the question, why this article was never associated to the development
of Feynman’s path integral approach. For the embedding of our particular topic into the
history of quantum mechanics, we recommend the book by F.Hund [35].

2 The value of interfering paths

Mechanics and geometrical optics are governed by integral principles which attribute a value
to each path in conﬁguration or phase space. The actual motions or propagations are iden-
tiﬁed by local extrema of this value which we call action. The simplest of these principles
is Fermat’s principle, where the action is the integral over the refraction index. In point
mechanics, the integral in time of the Lagrange function L[q, ˙q, t] = Ekinetic − Epotential is the
general rule. For time-independent total energy E, it contains the Maupertuis-Jacobi princi-
E − Epotential, thus providing the link between
ple, which identiﬁes the refraction index with
mechanics and geometrical optics. The name of Fermat is associated with the method of iden-
q
tifying the rays with minima of the integral over the refraction index. The name of Hamilton
is associated with the connection to wave propagation. The surfaces of constant phase deﬁne
transversal rays which are solutions to Fermat’s principle. The phase is proportional to some
action. For wave phenomena, the ray is produced by the interference implicit in Huygens’
principle, which excludes all other points of space in the limit of inﬁnitesimally small wave-
length. This is the argument to understand the meaning of the extremum principle for the
action. Mechanics seems to fail only in explaining dispersion and interference phenomena.

All this was known and used already in the discussion of early quantum theory. The ques-
tion then was how to distinguish between pure paths of particles and true wave phenomena.
In the realm of geometrical optics this is not possible, and the history of this recognition was
deeply inﬂuenced by Einstein [25, 26]. Einstein constructs his results with interfering paths
too, but these paths are real paths from diﬀerent source events. In addition, the experiment
which he proposed in [25] was wrongly evaluated and ended in disappointment.

In the historical evolution, quantum mechanics turned out to be wave mechanics. After
the construction of the Schr¨odinger equation, i.e. the appropriate wave equation, the wave
function was interpreted as providing a probability phase [6, 7], whose interferences produced
transition probabilities. Therefore, the notion used by Wentzel for reinstating the particle
concept is to interpret the result of interfering paths as transition probability, i.e. to translate
the language of wave theory into the language of particle statistics.

Feynman deﬁnes the value of a path qi[t] through the conﬁguration space by the action
L[qi, ˙qi, t]dt. This action integral yields the contribution of the path in ques-
integral S =
tion to the transition amplitude (qA|qE) from the conﬁguration E to the conﬁguration A.
This contribution diﬀers from path to path by a phase, and the total amplitude is the sum
of the interfering contributions.

In the ﬁrst paper of 1924 [63], Gregor Wentzel anticipated this idea in a strikingly ex-
plicit fashion. As we already noted, the discussion of the quantisation postulate at that
time opened a broad acknowledgement of the correspondence between geometrical optics
and point mechanics based on the variational principles of Fermat, Maupertuis and Jacobi
[8, 9, 12, 24]. The main question was to implement wave characteristics, and the general
proposition was to use Huygens principle [13, 18, 26, 27, 57]. This principle was usually
formulated as integral theorem for the wave equation. The interference interpretation never
involved the contributions of individual virtual paths.

Wentzel is the ﬁrst to consider the logical argument for the contribution of such paths
in phase space to a probability amplitude. The central issue is the measure of the deviation
i QidPi, in the canonical coordinates
from the classical path. Wentzel chooses the integral
where the momenta Pi are constants of motion (see appendix B). In extended phase space,
which can be constructed by (1) deﬁning time as an additional coordinate q0, (2) its conjugate
momentum p0 = −W as minus the energy, the Hamiltonian H[q, p, q0] + p0 vanishes. Here,
in any system of canonical coordinates we obtain

in these coordinates, for any path5. The quantum interference is supposed to be analogous
to the wave interference. Wentzel writes: Indem wir die klassische Wellenphase durch un-
sere Quantenphase ersetzen, ist es nun leicht, die wellentheoretische Interferenzformel in
die Sprache der Quantenstatistik zu ¨ubersetzen: Stehen dem Lichtquant verschiedene Wege
s von E nach A zur Verf¨ugung, so ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit, daß es auf einem beliebi-
gen der Wege s nach A gelangt und dort absorbiert wird, nicht etwa gleich der Summe der
4Canonical transformation possibly add a term not depending on the paths between given endpoints.
Hence, the interference of the diﬀerent contributions is not aﬀected. The path-independent term corresponds
to a phase factor in quantum mechanics. Wentzel’s expression diﬀers form Feynman’s by such a path-
independent term.

Wentzel identiﬁes the principle of zero deviation from “mechanics” with the Fermat-Jacobi
principle of least refraction-corrected path, as was general use in the discussion of the wave-
particle duality at that time. The decisive step however is to write an interference formula
for all diﬀerent paths with the same start and the same end, independent of their being
“mechanical”, i.e. solution of the equation of motion, or not. Such an interference formula
did not exist before. This constitutes the diﬀerence to all other attempts to interpret wave
phenomena by particle motion at that time. In the particular situation described by Wentzel,
the probability is related to the amplitude of light (fs is the vectorial amplitude of the clas-
sical wave), but both the variables entering the formulae and the basic philosophy are not
merely characteristic for optics alone, but for mechanics in general. Wentzel writes expressis
verbis: Die formale ¨Ubereinstimmung des Z¨ahlers mit dem Amplitudenquadrat superponierter
Wellen sichert dem Ansatz eine ausnahmslose G¨ultigkeit, was die Beschreibung irgendwelcher
Interferenzph¨anomene anbelangt7. We want to underline that the explicit use of the inter-
ference formula introduced by Wentzel is the decisive step to quantum particle mechanics.
The same interference concept is the basic idea of Feynman’s approach in 1948 too. The gap
to this approach consists in the explicit technics for handling a path integral, i.e. for really
calculating a transition amplitude.

3 The response to Wentzel’s article

Before the publication, in 1925, of Heisenberg’s method to calculate matrix elements, dis-
persion theory was one of the central topics of discussion. The question was how to get
interference and dispersion with a ﬂow of particles (the quanta of light, named “Nadel-
strahlung”) [26, 24, 42, 47, 57, 48, 59, 49]. The classical theory of dispersion explained the
relation between absorption lines and anomalous dispersion, but neither the number nor
the narrowness of lines. Guth [32] characterized that time by the battle between wave and
particle structure of light, the particle aspect always increasing its realm. Smekal [57] ex-
pected still a much longer way to show that wave theory was not indispensable for optics8.
6By replacing the classical phase of the wave with our quantum phase, it turns out to be simple to
translate the interference formula of wave theory into the language of quantum statistics: If the quantum of
light may propagate along diﬀerent paths from E to A, the probability for going to A along any of them
and being absorbed there is not given by the sum of the a priori probabilities of the individual paths s, but
J times that value.

7The formal coincidence of the numerator with the square of the amplitude of superposed waves ensures

the ansatz to be universally valid for the representation of interference phenomena of any kind.

8“Bis zur Verwirklichung derartiger Zukunftshoﬀnungen, welche in mancherlei Hinsicht geeignet waeren,
das Dogma von der Unentbehrlichkeit wellentheoretischer Ueberlegungen in der Optik der Reﬂexion und
Interferenz zu zerstoeren, ist aber vielleicht noch ein sehr weiter Weg.” (For the realization of such hopes
for the future, which would be appropriate under several respects, namely, to destroy the dogma of the

6

There had been several attempts to outline a particle-based explanation of wave phenomena
[26, 24, 42, 47, 48, 49, 44, 60, 45, 61]. None of them really reached the stage of a mathe-
matically constructed theory, and none of them reached the stage of a basis for mechanics
in general such as Wentzel’s.

Wentzel’s paper was always understood to be part of that discussion, even by Wentzel
himself, and the by far ampler importance of his postulates, for mechanics in general, went
along unnoticed. In addition, Wentzel used his scheme to argue for the adoption of an inter-
mediate orbit between initial and ﬁnal state of an atom interacting with light, and his results
were not backed by experiment. Kramers and Heisenberg used only the initial orbit and could
ﬁt the data [38]. The formulas which Wentzel developed for dispersion with his interference
concept in mind [65] were cited by Kramers and Heisenberg [38], but rejected in a lengthy
footnote9. The success of the formula found by Kramers and Heisenberg and the change in
direction of the following evolution of quantum mechanics made this judgement ﬁnal. So
Wentzel himself cites his paper only once, in the following article “Zur Quantentheorie des
R¨ontgenbremsspektrums” [64]. Already there the exposition of the method is banned to an
appendix10. In the journal Physikalische Berichte we ﬁnd an abstract by Wentzel himself,
which gives the impression too, that he only marginally recognized the importance of his
approach for mechanics11.

Wentzel was quoted by his colleague in M¨unchen K.F.Herzfeld [34]. It is not completely
clear whether Herzfeld cites Wentzel in reference to a program or to a theory in his article12.
As far as we found out, Herzfeld [68] was the last one to give a full account of Wentzel’s
approach, naming it “Corpuscular theory of interference”. But new interest did not arise.
Citing Wentzel, Herzfeld mentioned also Beck [2]. This shows that the interference notion
seemed to him to be more important than the integral over the manifold of paths.

Other authors quoted Wentzel’s concept occasionally. For instance, when Epstein and

indispensability of wave-theoretical arguments in the optics of reﬂection and interference, perhaps there is
still a much longer way.)

9In short: “Es gibt keine experimentellen Gr¨unde, die G¨ultigkeit einer einfacheren Formel anzuzweifeln.”

(There is no experimental motive to doubt the validity of the simpler (old) formula.)

10“Zur Quantentheorie unperiodischer Systeme im allgemeinen”
11Es wird versucht, die Interferenzerscheinungen vom Standpunkte der Lichtquanten aus als fundamentale
statistische Ph¨anomene zu verstehen. Die M¨oglichkeit dazu ergibt sich daraus, daß die Lichtphase
ds/λ
durch die Bohrsche Frequenzgleichung hc/λ = ∆W eine einfache mechanische Bedeutung erh¨alt. . . (It is
attempted to understand the interference phenomena from the viewpoint of light quanta as fundamental
statistical phenomena. From here the possibility emerges that the phase of the light obtains a simple me-
chanical meaning through Bohr’s frequency equation).

12Herzfeld writes: Die zweite Aufgabe besteht . . . in der quantentheoretischen Deutung des Huygensschen
Prinzips. Diese Aufgabe ist aber . . . nicht verschieden von der allgemeinen, welche die quantentheoretische
Deutung der Interferenz stellt. Sobald diese gel¨ost ist [63], ist damit auch die Brechung usw. erkl¨art (The
second task is the quantum interpretation of Huygens’ principle. This task is not distinct from the general one
to explain the interference in quantum theory. As soon as this problem is solved, refraction etc. is explained
too).

R

Ehrenfest [27] wrote that coherence and interference would resist any attempt to under-
stand, Smekal [58] answered by citing Wentzel as an example for such an understanding.
A.Land´e [43] too presumably felt the importance of the concept, but he criticized it with
an argument based on causality. However, this argument would invalidate also Feynman, if
correct and applicable. Pauli [50] cites Wentzel and Herzfeld only together with Ornstein
and Burger [47, 48, 49], which proves that he did not notice the far more general importance
and the explicitness of Wentzel’s concept13. Pringsheim [51] and Kulenkampﬀ [41] only quote
the experimental argument against Wentzel’s dispersion theory.

Presumably under the inﬂuence of the successes of quantum mechanics Wentzel changed
his attitude and restricted his work to the use of the classical (“mechanical”) solutions
and to the correspondence of the Hamilton-Jacobi function to a single phase. In this way,
Wentzel also found the approximation scheme now known as Wentzel-Brillouin-Kramers
method [66, 11, 10, 39]. Here at last, the concept of interfering paths is forgotten. All the
studies concerning the correspondence between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics
now concentrated on geometrical optics and canonical transformation theory [36, 37, 62].
The Schr¨odinger equation was ﬁtted best to the task of calculating spectra and underlying
energy levels, and both the problem of second quantization and of calculating transitions in
more general problems were still ahead.

Even in F.Hund [35], who explicitely aims to answer the question whether quantum me-

chanics could have evolved diﬀerently, we ﬁnd no hint to Wentzel’s path integrals.

Dirac was the next to express the idea of getting probabilities by superposition of paths
[21]. Dirac connected it mainly to the canonical tranformation theory in the direction of the
Wentzel-Brillouin-Kramers approximation, i.e. to geometrical optics. The interference prin-
ciple is formulated, but not explicitly. The identiﬁcation of a phase with the action integral is
the result of the construction of the unitary evolution operator. This construction is not pos-
sible without the knowledge of quantum mechanics existing at that time in the Heisenberg or
Schr¨odinger form. Feynman [30] asserts that his work was inspired by Dirac’s publications.
Now Dirac was always very sparing of citations, so it is diﬃcult to draw conclusions from his
not mentioning Wentzel. In the end, nobody recognized the outline already formulated by
Wentzel; even he himself apparently never came back to the driving idea of his early work
on quantum optics.

The reader of older literature is often suspected of falling into the trap of reading things
into a book instead of reading out of a book. However, any book is complete only with the
reader and changes with its reader. At any time, literature is lost if not read anew, with
13“Die Versuche von G.Wentzel, K.F.Herzfeld und L.S.Ornstein u. H.C.Burger, die Ausbreitung des
Lichtes in dispergierenden Medien vom reinen Lichtquantenstandpunkt aus zu behandeln, k¨onnen vorl¨auﬁg
wohl noch kaum als befriedigend angesehen werden.” (The attempts by G.Wentzel, K.F.Herzfeld and
L.S.Ornstein and H.C.Burger to deal with the propagation of light in dispersive media from a pure light-
quantum viewpoint at present cannot yet be considered satisfactory.)

physics, but also capability of deeper reading14.

We want to thank H.-J.Treder for discussion and help with his private library, and to
acknowledge the contribution of L.Mihich (Pavia) and F.Antoci for help and hints with the
citations.

Appendices

A Wentzel’s paper

At the beginning of his article “Zur Quantenoptik” Wentzel observes that since Einstein’s
derivation of Planck’s radiation law certain probabilities are attributed to the emission and
absorption processes, but no more precise assertions are made. He intends to propose a
general hypothesis for such probabilities, that in his opinion can help in overcoming the
contradiction existing in theoretical optics: wave theory of interference and polarization on
one side, quantum theory of the spectral lines on the other side. To this end, he interprets
the interferences as the oﬀspring of underlying quantum-statistical laws.

In Section 1 of his paper Wentzel remembers that the most important foundation of the
quantum theory is certainly the law that an atomic system cannot radiate if it ﬁnds itself
in what he calls a mechanical state, i.e. a state in which the laws of classical mechanics are
obeyed.Radiative processes are instead invariably associated with “transitions” for which the
laws of classical mechanics do not hold. But not only the acts of emission and of absorption
are “non-mechanical”, since the very presence of light propagating through a transparent
medium will cause non-mechanical perturbations in the atoms involved in the process.

In order to provide an invariant measure of the deviations of the intra-atomic motions
from Hamiltonian mechanics, Wentzel considers the canonical coordinates βk and the con-
jugate momenta αk associated with the atomic systems involved in the propagation of light.
For simplicity, the αk are assumed to be constant in the mechanical states. Then the desired
k βkdαk. This integral is extended to the particular
measure is provided by the integral
path in phase space that corresponds to the deviations from mechanics caused by a light
quantum going from an emitting atom E to an absorbing atom A in a certain way. Wentzel
14J.L.Borges writes in the essay El libro [3]: Cada vez que leemos un libro, el libro ha cambiado, la con-
notaci´on de las palabras es otra. Adem´as, los libros est´an cargados de pasado . . . Si leemos un libro antiguo
es como si ley´eramos todo el tiempo que ha transcurrido desde el d´ıa en que fue escrito y nosotros. (Every
time when we read a book, the book has changed, the connotation of the words is diﬀerent. In addition, the
books are loaded with past . . . If we read an ancient book, it is as if we read all the time elapsed between
the day when it was written and us.)

As a check of his ideas within geometrical optics Wentzel envisages the simple system con-

vacuo with the velocity c along the path joining the two atoms, and from his deﬁnition (7)
of the phase, by retaining only the ﬁrst addendum, he recovers Bohr’s ∆W = hν principle.

In Section 2, Wentzel deﬁnes his interference formula. If the light quantum has several
paths at his disposal for going from an emitting atom E to an absorbing atom A, the overall
probability of the process is not equal to the sum of the a priori probabilities associated with
the individual paths, which is given by

where fs is the vector amplitude of the classical wave associated with the s-th path. The
overall probability is instead supposed to be J times the a priori probability, where

and the complex amplitude F is given by

where ϕs is the quantum phase deﬁned by (6) or by (7). Wentzel emphasizes the general
validity of his formula for interference processes of any kind, and the advantage of ensuring
15Since Wentzel does not write the upper limit to the summation index k, it is possible to interpret this
new deﬁnition in two ways: either it is the outcome of a canonical transformation performed in ordinary
phase space, or it corresponds to an extension of the phase space itself by the addition of energy and time
as a further conjugate pair. In the latter case the phase introduced by Wentzel is just the one considered
by Feynman (apart for a wrong sign, and a path-independent term). In the appendix to a subsequent paper
[64] Wentzel clearly chooses the latter option, and also corrects the sign error of eq.(7).

a priori that the “wavelength” measured through the interferences and through the photo-
electric eﬀect are one and the same thing.

He further notices an essential feature: in his conception the emitting and the absorb-
ing systems are intrinsically coupled. To him it is also noteworthy that no interference is
conceivable without the presence of the absorbing system. Section 2 ends with a long Note
dealing with the issue of the coherence length, as it can be confronted from the proposed
viewpoint.

In Section 3 Wentzel outlines a theory of discrete spectra through a specialized use of
his phase and interference formulae. While contemplating only the degrees of freedom of the
emitting atom, he introduces the action variables Ik and the conjugated angle variables

tentatively16 postulates that they remain constant also during the transitions, and assumes
that, in order to get the transition probability, one shall modify the interference formula
proposed in Section 2, since one shall not only sum the amplitudes associated with the
individual paths, but also take the average over the undetermined phases uk. Under these
assumptions, he ﬁnds that the probability of transition can be nonvanishing only when the
action variables change by an integer multiple of Planck’s action quantum:

∆Ik = nkh .

(12)

Therefore, if initially “quantized”, the atom will ﬁnd itself after the transition in another
quantized state.

Under the mentioned assumptions Wentzel calculates the expression for the amplitude
F and ﬁnds agreement with Bohr’s correspondence principle for the intensity and for the
polarization. Then he compares his result with the predictions of the classical wave theory,
and asserts that through his theory one can describe refraction, reﬂection and double re-
fraction just as it is done classically; in fact, he adds, Huygens’ principle is just based on
interferences.

Wentzel ends the Section and the paper by observing that, while in the former quantum
theory the action quantum h had to be introduced twice, i.e. once in the ∆W = hν principle,
and a second time in the quantum conditions, his theory allows to introduce it just once, in
the expression (6) for the quantum phase.

16Already in the subsequent paper [64] dealing with continuous spectra Wentzel changes his mind, and
assumes that the emission and the absorption processes are characterized by the variation in time of both
the action variables and of the undetermined phases.

B Canonical transformations

Canonical coordinates (qi, pk) are coordinates of the phase space. They are deﬁned by the
canonical form of the equations of motion,

dqi
dt

=

∂H[q, p, t]
∂pi

,

dpk
dt

= −

∂H[q, p, t]
∂qk

.

Because of the sign, we identify conﬁguration coordinates qi and conjugate momenta pk.
Canonical transformations are transitions from one set of canonical coordinates (q, p) to an-
other one (Q, P ). The method of interest to generate canonical transformations is a Legendre
transform. We assume the existence of a generating function F [q, P, t] depending on the old
conﬁguration coordinates qi and the new momenta Pk. The function F [q, P, t] generates the
transformation by

Qi =

∂F [q, P, t]
∂Pi

, pk =

∂F [q, P, t]
∂qk

.

The new Hamilton function is then given by

can be solved. The Hamilton-Jacobi transformation aims at a vanishing new Hamiltonian
and constant conﬁguration coordinates and momenta:

Then we get

QidPi = −Ldt + dS .

By this transform, the congruence of paths in phase space can be mapped onto the initial
values Qi, Pi(i = 1, . . . , n) of coordinates and momenta at some time t0. If we characterize
the states by ordinary coordinates q[t] and conjugate momenta p[t], the integral

Because the left-hand side vanishes for the solutions of the canonical equations (the “me-
chanical” paths in Wentzel’s language), the right-hand side is not merely the action integral
corrected by the path-independent term SA − SE, but the deviation in the action integral,
which is zero for the extremal.

If the Hamilton function does not depend on time explicitly, we may look for action-angle

variables by separating the time from the Hamilton-Jacobi function. We obtain

H = H[q, p] ,

= 0 , S[q, P, t] = W [q, P ] − E[P ]t

One may interpret Wentzel’s introduction of the energy as canonical momentum as follows.
We solve E = E[P ] for the ﬁrst momentum P1, and use E instead of the old P1 for the ﬁrst
new momentum, separating it from the others (P2, . . . , Pn). We then obtain

˙Q1 =

= 1 → Q1 = t + t0 ,

˙Q2, . . . , ˙Qn = 0 .

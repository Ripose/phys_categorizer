Abstract

The pathways along which A. Einstein and D. Hilbert indepen-
dently came to the gravitational ﬁeld equations are traced. Some of
the papers that assert a point of view on the history of the deriva-
tion of the gravitational ﬁeld equations “that radically diﬀers from the
standard point of view” are critically analyzed. It is shown that the
conclusion drawn in these papers are completely groundless.

Introduction

Since the studies by J. Earman and C. Glymour [1] it became clear that the
equations of A. Einstein’s general relativity were discovered almost simulta-
neously, but with diﬀerent methods, by D. Hilbert and A. Einstein.

In 1997 an article appeared in the journal “Science” under the title “Be-
lated Decision in the Hilbert–Einstein Priority Dispute” [2], the authors of which
claim that “...knowledge of Einstein’s result may have been crucial to Hilbert’s
introduction of the trace term into his ﬁeld equations”. On this ground they
push forward their point of view “that radically diﬀers from the standard
point of view” and which is exposed in a many-page ref.[3].

According to the standard point of view Einstein and Hilbert, indepen-
dently of each other and in diﬀerent ways, discovered the gravitational ﬁeld
equations. The same question was the subject of the paper [4].

What is the question? In the Einstein paper [5] the gravitational ﬁeld

equations are given:

where, as usual, gµν is a metric tensor; Rµν is the Ricci tensor, κ stands
for the gravitational coupling constant, Tµν is the energy-momentum tensor
density for matter, T is the trace of Tµν:

T = gµνTµν .

The authors of the paper [2] assert that Hilbert, when having took knowledge

of these equations and having seen the “trace term”

gµνT

, would be also

“introduced” into his equations [6],

the trace term (in this case

Let us see in what ﬁeld equation Hilbert needed, according to the authors
[2], to “introduce the trace term”. The authors of ref.
[2] do not take into
account that in the Hilbert approach nothing can be “introduced” because
everything is exactly deﬁned by the world function (Lagrangean).

H = R + L ,

discovered by Hilbert, which plays a key role for derivation of the gravita-
tional equations in the framework of the least action principle.

The authors of [2] produced their discovery when they took knowledge
of the proofs of the Hilbert paper (in which, by the way, some parts are
missed. See [7], where, in particular, the remained parts of the proofs are
reproduced) and saw that the gravitational ﬁeld equations were presented
there in the form of the variational derivative of [√gR] in gµν

but not in the form (1). Thereof they draw their conclusion that Hilbert did
not derived the gravitation equations in the form (1).

But if even everything were so, then at any rate Hilbert needed
nothing to “introduce” in addition because Eq.(2) turns exactly into Eq.(1)
after some quite trivial calculations. Things, however, go not in such
In order to show that the statement by
a way as authors of [2] wrote.

2

the authors of [2] has no serious grounds we have to give an account of the
basics of D. Hilbert’s work (see Section 1).

On the basis of the idea of equivalence of acceleration and gravity Einstein
in the joint article [8] with M. Grossmann in 1913 identiﬁed the gravitational
ﬁeld and the metric tensor of a pseudo-Riemannian (below, just Rieman-
nian) space. In such a way the tensorial gravitational ﬁeld was introduced.
Einstein, in this article, formulates, on the basis of some simple model, the
general energy-momentum conservation law:

∂ν(√

g Θν

σ) +

√

g Θµν∂σgµν = 0.

(3)

“The ﬁrst three of these relations (σ = 1, 2, 3) express the momentum conser-
vation law, the latter (σ = 4) that of energy conservation,” Einstein wrote.
Here Θµν stands for the energy-momentum tensor of matter. It is necessary
to note that such a law of energy-momentum conservation for any
material system was introduced by Einstein still as a plausible physical as-
sumption. In the same article M. Grossman showed that Eq.(3) is covariant
under arbitrary transformations and can be cast into the form

∇νΘν
∇ν is a covariant derivative with respect to the metric gµν.
Einstein posed a problem to ﬁnd out the gravitational equation of the

σ = 0,

(4)

here

form

Γµν = κ Θµν,

(5)

where Γµν is a tensor composed of the metric and its derivatives.

It worth to notice that in the part of this article which was written by
Grossman, the possible use of the Ricci tensor, Rµν, as Γµν from Eq.(5), was
discussed.

M.Grossman writes: ”It turns out, however, that this tensor in the special

case of inﬁnitely weak static force ﬁeld does not reduce itself into ∆ϕ”.

Later Einstein, following his ideas, searched for Γµν as a tensor under
arbitrary linear transformations. He would follow this way till November
1915. At the end of June (beginning of July) 1915 Einstein, invited by
Hilbert, spent a week in G¨ottingen, where he, as he recollected later, “gave
there six two-hour lectures”.
It is evident that afterwards D. Hilbert got
interested in the problem.

3

The Einstein formulation of the problem and his identiﬁcation of the
gravitation potential with the metric tensor gµν of a Riemannian space ap-
peared the key ones for Hilbert. That was suﬃcient for him to ﬁnd out
the gravitational ﬁeld equation proceeding from the principle of the least
action (Hilbert’s Axiom I) and from his profound knowledge of the theory of
invariants. All this is directly seen in the paper by Hilbert [6].

Below we give an account of Hilbert’s approach to derivation of the grav-
itational ﬁeld equation, and also give a critical analysis of the articles [2,3,4]
devoted to the same question.

1. Hilbert’s Approach

Let us consider attentively Hilbert’s approach [6]. He formulates Axiom I:

The laws of physical events are deﬁned by the world function H the argu-

ments of which are

gµν, gµνℓ =

gµνℓk =

∂2gµν
∂xℓ∂xk ,

qs, qsℓ =

(ℓ, k = 1, 2, 3, 4),

∂gµν
∂xℓ ,

∂xℓ ,

being the variation of the integral

H√g dω,

Z

(g =

,

gµν|

|

dω = dx1dx2dx3dx4),

(6)

disappears for any of 14 potentials gµν, qs”.

He writes further: “As to the world function H, additional axioms are
needed for its unambigious deﬁnition. If only second derivatives of potentials
gµν can enter the gravitation equations, then the function H has to have the
form2

(7)
2In ref.[6] Hilbert used the notations Kµν and K for the Ricci tensor and the scalar
curvature. We use for them, and also for other quantities, modern notations. We also use
in all citations the numeration of formulas according to our text.

H = R + L,

where R is an invariant following from the Riemann tensor (scalar curvature
of a four-dimensional manifold):

R = gµνRµν,

Rµν = ∂νΓα

(10)

It is easy to see from (8) and (9) that both in R and Rµν second-
order derivatives of the metric enter linearly. Second rank tensors
with such properties are

Rµν and

gµνR.

(10a)

All other tensors with such properties are obtained as combinations
of these tensors.

This conclusion, to some extent, was known to Einstein, and he, men-
tioning tensors of the second rank, which could lead to the gravitational
equations with derivatives not higher than of the second order, wrote in the
letter to H.A. Lorentz 19 January 1916 [9]:

“. . . aside from tensors...

Rµν

and gµνR

there are no (arbitrary substitutions for covariant) tensors. . . ”

For mathematician D. Hilbert that was evident.

Let us denote for the sake of brevity and following to Hilbert the left part

of the equation by the symbol

[√gR]µν =

∂√gR

∂k

∂√gR
∂gµν

.

(11)

Then Eq.(10) takes the form

[√gR]µν =

∂√gL
∂gµν .

−

(12)

Note that in Hilbert’s method of the gravitation equations derivation one does
not need speciﬁcation of the Lagrangean function of the material system. In
paper [6] D. Hilbert infers, in Theorem II, the identity:

δL(√g J) + ∂λ(δxλ√g J) = 0 ,

(12a)

where δL is the Lie derivative; J is an arbitrary function invariant under
coordinate transformations. He uses this identity when obtaining Eq.(48).

Then D. Hilbert proves a very important theorem III: “Let J is an
invariant depending only on the components of gµν and their derivatives; the
variational derivatives of √gJ in gµν are designated, as earlier, as [√gJ]µν.
If hµν is an arbitrary contravariant tensor then the quantity

1
√g

[√g J]µνhµν

is also invariant; if one substitutes the standard tensor pµν instead of hµν and
writes

where expressions

[√g J]µνpµν = (isps + ie

is = [√g J]µν∂sgµν ,

depend only on gµν and their derivatives, then

iℓ
s =

is =

∂iℓ

in the sense that this equation holds identically for all arguments, i.e. gµν
and their derivatives”.

Hilbert applies this theorem to the case J = R. Then identity (17) as-

sumes the form:

This identity is similar to (3), hence one can write it in the form (4)

We see that the covariant derivative of the variational derivative [√g R]ℓ
equal to zero. Thus, on the basis of (12) we get

According to Hilbert the energy-momentum tensor density of the material

system, Tµν, is deﬁned as follows:

and equality (20) can be written down as a covariant conservation law of the
energy-momentum tensor of the material system:

It was Hilbert who gave for the ﬁrst time the deﬁnition (21) of the energy-
momentum tensor of the material system and showed that this tensor satisﬁes
Eq. (22); by that he gave a basis of the Einstein’s assumption from Ref. [8].
So, D. Hilbert found the gravitational ﬁeld equation3

[√g R]µν =

κ Tµν,

−

from which the law of covariant conservation of energy-momentum
follows exactly (22).

Multiplying both parts of Eq. (23) by gµν and summing up in indices µ

and ν we get

gµν[√g R]µν =

κ T .

In the l.h.s. of Eq.(24) an invariant is formed, which contain second deriva-
tives lineary. But there exists only one such invariant, R. One gets thereof

Summarizing one can say that the gravitational ﬁeld equations were found
by D. Hilbert and, by that, the problem, posed by A. Einstein in
1913 was resolved. Eq. (23) are identical with Eq.(1). They diﬀer
only in the form. Below we will see that, according to Hilbert,
Eqs. (23) are easily transformed into (1). Hilbert, both in the proofs
and in the paper [6], wrote: “In the following I want . . . to establish
. . . a new system of fundamental equations of physics”. And further:
“. . . my fundamental equations” , “. . . my theory. . . ”. D. Hilbert could
not write so, if he did not considered himself the author of “fundamental
equations of physics”.

The tensor density [√g R]µν in Eq. (23) contains by construction the
second order derivatives linearly, so, on the basis of (10a) this energy density
has the form

[√g R]µν = √g(Rµν + αgµνR) .

(26)

Expression (26) was quite evident for Hilbert. Maybe for the authors of [2,3,4]
it is diﬃcult to understand that, but this is their personal aﬀair. For the l.h.s.
of Eq. (24) one obtaines, on the basis of (26),

gµν[√g R]µν = √g(4α + 1)R,

(27)

which is in complete correspondence with (25). Namely about these general
reasonings Hilbert wrote: “. . . what is clear without calculations if to take into
account that R is the only invariant and Rµν is the only (besides gµν) second-
order tensor, which can be constructed from gµν and its ﬁrst and second
derivatives gµν

k , gµν

kℓ ”.

Authors of the paper [2] (see also [3]) write in this connection “This argu-
ment is, however, untenable, because there are many other tensors of second
rank and many other invariants that can be constructed from the Riemann
tensor”.

This statement of the authors of [2] has no relation to the exact
Hilbert’s argument because the authors of papers [2,3] overlooked
the main thing: one argued on the construction of the gravitational
equations containing derivatives of gµν of order not higher than
two. Hilbert specially wrote about that in his paper [6]: “If only second
order derivatives of the potentials gµν can enter the gravitational equations,
then the function H has to have the form

H = R + L ”.

8

Therefore D. Hilbert was absolutely right that in this case only R and
two tensors, Rµν and gµνR, contain linearly second derivatives of the grav-
itational potential gµν. All other tensors with such properties are linear
combinations of these tensors.

Likewise the author of the paper [4] is wrong when he writes:

. . . variati-
onal derivation of the equations is absent, and the right form of the equations
(with the “half ” term) is motivated (not quite correctly) by the uniqueness of
the Ricci tensor and the scalar curvature as generally covariant quantities,
depending only on gµν’s and their ﬁrst and second derivatives

≪

.

It is astonishing indeed when the author of the paper [4] writes about
Hilbert’s paper: “...variational derivation... is absent”. He probably forgot
a well known circumstance that the Lagrange equations, which were pre-
sented by Hilbert, are a consequence of the least action principle (Axiom I
of Hilbert). Thus, the variational derivation of the gravitational ﬁeld
equation takes place in Hilbert’s paper [6].

≫

How the authors of [2,3,4] make up their mind to analyze and to judge
D. Hilbert’s papers [6] if they do not understand the essence of his exact
mathematical arrguments? The authors of papers [2,3] write further: “Even
if one requires the tensors and invariants to be linear in the Riemann tensor,
the crucial coeﬃcient of the trace term remains undetermined by such an
argument”. This is again wrong, it is easily determined. Hilbert proved the
identity (19)

With account of Eq. (26) and with use of the local frame where Christoﬀel’s
symbols are zero, the identity (28) takes a simple form:

∇σ[√g R]σ

Thus “the critical coeﬃcient”, that is a concern of the authors of [2,3],
is obtained in Hilbert’s approach in a trivial way by taking derivatives fairly
accessible to a ﬁrst-year student of a university.
It is also clear that the
trace term 1
2gµνR does not arise as a result of some arbitrary “introduction”
into the ﬁeld equations formulated by Hilbert; it is organically contained
there.

Later, in 1921, in the paper [10], A. Einstein would construct the geo-

metrical part of the gravitational equations making use of the tensor

Rµν + agµνR,

i.e. in the same way as it was done earlier by Hilbert at the transformation
of gravitation equations (12) to the form (34). Creative endeavour of the
authors of [2,3] is crowned with the following thoughtful conclusion: “Taken
together, this sequence suggests that knowledge of Einstein’s result may have
been crucial to Hilbert’s introduction of the trace term into his ﬁeld equa-
tions”.

How can one arrive to such an idea after reading Hilbert’s paper? Let
us remind to the authors of [2] that, in Hilbert’s formalism, one does
not need to introduce anything. As soon as one wrote the world
function H in the form

H = R + L,

and established Theorem III, the rest was just a matter of calcu-
lational techniques, and nothing more.

Thus, the analysis that we have undertaken on the judgements
of the authors of [2] shows that all their reproofs to Hilbert are ei-
ther wrong or do not concern him. So all their arguments in favour
of the point of view “that radically diﬀers” from the standard one
are inconclusive.

But this is the Bianchi identity.

Poor knowledge of Hilbert’s paper can be met not only in Refs.[2]. For in-
15.3, wrote: “Evidently Hilbert did not know
stance, A. Pais in the book [11],
§
the Bianchi identities either!” and further: “I repeat one last time that nei-
ther Hilbert nor Einstein was aware of the Bianchi identities in that crucial
November 1915”. “Interesting enough, in 1917 the experts were not aware
that Weyl’s derivation of Eq. 15.4 (The identity in question. —Authors) by
variational techniques was a brand new method for obtaining a long-known re-
sult”. A. Pais was right in that A.Einstein did not know the Bianchi identity
in that crucial November 1915. All the rest in [11], concerning Hilbert,
is wrong. The matter is that Hilbert did not know the Bianchi
identity, indeed. He just himself obtained it. D. Hilbert proved with
variational method the general identity (see Theorem III by Hilbert), from
which, putting J = R, he obtained also the Bianchi identity.

Thus it was not Weyl in 1917 but Hilbert in 1915 who obtained
15.3
the Bianchi identity with variational method. A. Pais wrote in
“In November 1915, neither Hilbert nor Einstein was aware of this royal road
to the conservation laws. Hilbert had come close”.

§

The authors of [3] write similarly: “. . . ... Hilbert did not discover royal
road to the formulation of the ﬁeld equations of general relativity. In fact, he
did not formulate these equations at all. . . ”.

All this is wrong. Namely Hilbert found the shortest and general way
to formulate the gravitational equations. He found the Lagrange function of
the gravitational ﬁeld, R, with help of which the gravitational equations are
obtained automatically via the principle of the least action. One obtains
them namely in such a way when giving an account of Einstein’s
General Relativity. It is a pity that A. Pais seems to look through the
Hilbert paper superﬁcially; the same is true for the authors of Refs. [2,3].

Later, in 1924, D. Hilbert wrote [12]: “In order to deﬁne the expression
s , taken in the

[√g R]µν one chooses ﬁrst the frame in such a way that all gµν
world point, disappear. We ﬁnd thereof

[√g R]µν = √g

gµνR

”.

Authors of [2] write, concerning this: “To summarize: Initially Hilbert did
not give the explicit form of the ﬁeld equations; then, after Einstein had
published his ﬁeld equations, Hilbert claimed that no calculation is necessary;
ﬁnally, he conseded that one is.”.

This statement is a creation of the mind of the authors of [2]. No solid
reasons exist that Hilbert did not obtained, himself, the explicit form of the
ﬁeld equations. One obtains them in an elementary way from Eqs.(23) and
expression (26) with the use of the identity (28). If one can seriously as-
sume that Hilbert was not able to obtain (33) from (28)? Hilbert’s
addition made in 1924 does not mean a “recognition that calculation is nec-
essary”. He introduced it just to remind a simple method to ﬁnd a tensor.
This did not discard his exact argument (“...clear without calculation”) at
all.

The authors of [2,3] claim, referring to the Proofs, that Hilbert had the
gravitation equation only in the form (23). Equation (23) contains the deriva-
tives

It is impossible to imagine a physicist-theorist or mathematician who would
not calculate these derivatives and obtain explicitly the diﬀerential equations
containing only derivatives gµν
kℓ . As we have seen, it was not nesessary,
for Hilbert, to calculate them, because he managed to identity the struc-
ture of the expression [√g R]µν from the general and rigorous mathematical
statements, due to which the calculation of the “critial coeﬃcient” became
trivial.

That is why the conclusion of the authors of papers [2,3,4], that
Hilbert did not obtain the “explicit form of the gravitational ﬁeld
equations” cannot be true. It contradicts also, as we will see further,
to the correspondence between Einstein and Hilbert, from which everything
becomes absolutely clear, and no additional arguments are needed. There
does not exist more decisive argument than the evidence of Einstein himself.
But precisely this most important evidence of Einstein was left
aﬁeld by the authors of [2,3], who put into the center of their analysis
unpublished and multilated material of Hilbert.

The Einstein evidence in his letter to Hilbert of 18 November 1915 ex-
cludes unambiguously any false conjectures about Hilbert’s paper [6]. Thus,
the “archive ﬁnding” of the authors of [2], as a matter of principle, cannot
shatter the evidence of Einstein himself. One could stop here the further dis-

12

cussion of the question. But the authors of [2,3,4] alongside their arguments
make erroneous conclusions about Hilbert’s paper [6]. So we would like to
specially concentrate on this.

Even if one does not follow the general statements of Hilbert, it us still
possible, making use of deﬁnition (11), to execute simple diﬀerentiation and
to express the tensor density [√g R]µν in terms of the Ricci tensor density
and scalar density √g R. The ﬁrst term in (11) can be written in the form

It is easy to see that terms in ﬁgure parenthesis dissapear identically. The

to the expression

The authors of paper [3] wrote: “In both the Proofs and the published version
of the paper [6], Hilbert erroneously claimed that one can consider the last four
equations (i.e. electromagnetic ﬁeld equations. —Authors) as a consequence
of the 4 identities that must hold, according to his Theorem I, between the 14
diﬀerential equations. . . ”.

(cid:17)

Things, however, are not such as the authors of [3] suppose. Theorems I
and II are formulated for J, an invariant under arbitrary transformations of
the four world parameters. According to these theorems, there exist four
identities for any invariant. Hilbert, in his paper, considers two invariants,
R and L. The general invariant H is composed of these two invariants:

H = R + L .

where

ant L:

The gravitation equations, in Hilbert’s notations, have the form:

Hilbert choses the invariant L as a function of the variables gµν, qσ, ∂νqσ and
so he obtains the generalized Maxwell equations

[√g L]ν =

∂√g L

∂qν −

∂√g L
∂(∂µqν)

.

(cid:19)

∂µ

(cid:18)

Then, on the basis of Theorem II, Hilbert obtained that the Lagrange
function L depends on the derivatives of the potential qν only via the com-
bination Fµν, i.e.

[√g R]µν =

κ Tµν ,

−

[√g L]ν = 0,

L(Fµν) ,

Fµν = ∂µqν −

∂νqµ .

L = αQ + f (q) ,

On this basic Hilbert chooses the Lagrangean in the form

Q = FµνFλσgµσgνλ,

q = qµqνgµν,

here α is a constant.

Hilbert then remarks that the equations of electrodynamics “can be con-

sidered as a consequence of the equations of gravitation”.

According to Theorem II the four identities take place for the invari-

∇µT µ

ν = Fµν[√g L]µ + qν∂µ[√g L]µ.

It follows from identity (47) that, if the equations of motion of a material
system (41) hold, then the covariant conservation law takes place:

If one makes use of the gravitation equations (34) for identity (47) the one
gets Hilbert’s equations

Fµν[√g L]µ + qν∂µ[√g L]µ = 0,

Equations (48) have to be compatible with the equations, which fol-
low from the principle of the least action with the same Lagrangean
L. It is only possible in the case, when the “generalized Maxwell equa-
tions” hold:

[√g L]ν = 0.

(49)

Therefore, the author of paper [4] is completely wrong, considering that
“in the case of gauge-noninvariant Mie’s theory with a Lagrangean of the
kind (45) one has in general use not the generalized Maxwell equations (49),
but rather equations (48).”

This statement contradicts the principle of the least-action, i.e. Hilbert’s
Axiom I. So, the four identities (47) due to Theorem II and equa-
tions of gravitation (34) lead to the four equations (48) which are
compactible with the generalized Maxwell equations, obtained on
the basis of Hilbert’s Axiom I. This is what Hilbert emphasized in pa-
per [6]. In this relation he pointed out: “. . . from the gravitation equations
(10) there really follow 4 mutually independent linear combinations (48) of
equations of the electrodynamics (41) (emphasized by the authors)
altogether with their ﬁrst derivatives”.

One has to specially stress that Hilbert writes about “linear combina-
tions of the equations of electrodynamics (41)”, but not the expressions (42).
Namely here the authors of [3,4] admit a confusion.
Let us note that in the particular case, when

L = αQ,

(50)

the second term in Eq.(48) dissapears identically and we come to the equa-
tions

It follows therefore that if the determinant
euations take place

is not zero, the Maxwell

which is in full agreement with the principle of the least action (Hilbert’s
Axiom I). In such a way the Maxwell equation are the consequence
of the gravitation equation (34) and four identities (47). All this
follows from Hilbert’s article if one reads it attentively. Afterwards Einstein

Fµν[√g L]µ = 0.

[√g L]µ = 0,

15

together with Infeld and Hoﬀmann in [13], and also Fock in [14] would obtain
the equation of motion of a material system from the gravitation equations.
One notices quite often that Hilbert obtained the gravitational ﬁeld equa-
tion “. . . not for an arbitrary material system, but especially basing on Mie’s
theory” [15]. That is not quite right. Method which Hilbert used is general
and no limitations are implied on the form of the function L.

The circumstance that the gravitation equations imply four equations
for the material system, looked attractive for Hilbert and he applied his
general equations to Mie’s theory. Such a uniﬁcation of gravitation and
Mie’s theory was not fruitful, but Hilbert’s general method for obtaining the
gravitation equations proved to be very far-reaching.

Now a few words about auxialiary noncovariant equations.
To solve a problem it is always necessary to have a complete system of
equations. There are only ten equations of general relativity. One still needs
to add four equations, which cannot be chosen generally covariant. These
auxiliary conditions are called coordinate conditions, and can be of various
kinds. Hilbert meant namely this when he wrote (see Proofs in [7]): “As our
mathematical Theorem shows us, the previous Axioms I and II can give only
10 mutually independent equations for 14 potentials. On the other hand, due
to general invariance, more than 10 essentially independent equations for 14
potentials, gµν, qs, are impossible, and, as we wish to hold on Cauchy’s theory
for diﬀerential equations and to give to basic equations of physics a deﬁnite
character, an addition to (4) and (5) of auxiliary non-invariant equations is
inevitable.”

This is a mathematical requirement and it is necessary for a theory.
Hilbert tried to obtain these additional equations in the framework of the
very theory, but he failed to do this and did not include that into the pub-
lished article.

So the basic system of the 10 equations of general relativity is generally
covariant, but the complete system of equations which is necessary to solve
problems is not generally covariant because four equations expressing coor-
dinate restrictions cannot be tensorial; they are not generally covariant. The
solution to a complete system of the gravitational ﬁeld equations can be al-
ways written in any admissible coordinate system. Namely here a notion of
the chart atlas arises.

That is why the statement of the authors of [2,3,4] that Hilbert’s
theory is not generally covariant, in contrast with Einstein’s theory,
is wrong. The complete system of equations both of Hilbert and

16

Einstein is not generally covariant.

The only diﬀerence was in that Hilbert tried to uniquely construct these
non-covariant equations in the framework of the very theory. This appeared
impossible. The equations deﬁning the choice of frame became quite arbi-
trary but not tensorial.

In this relation J. Synge [16] writes:“One can ﬁnd in the papers on general
relativity a number of various coordinate conditions, pursuing every time
special aims. In order to approach the problem in a uniﬁed way let us write
down the coordinate conditions in the form

Ci = 0,

(i = 0, 1, 2, 3).

The metric tensor gij must satisfy these equations (perhaps diﬀerential). Cer-
tainly, they cannot be tensorial, because they are satisﬁed only at a special
choice of coordinates. ”. What is the material on which the authors of the
paper [2] made their conclusions? In the so-called proofs of D. Hilbert’s pa-
per, they proceeded from, the invariants H and K are used but there is no
their deﬁnition. D. Hilbert writes in the Proofs: “I would like to construct
below a new system of basic equations of physics, following the axiomatic
method and proceeding, essentially, from the three axioms”.

Evidently, Hilbert had to deﬁne the invariants H and K in order to do
that. It is impossible to imagine that Hilbert, having posed such an aim, did
not deﬁne these fundamental quantities. But this means that the parts
absent from the Proofs are very essential and contain an important
information. Valid conclusions cannot be made without account of
this key infromation.

However the authors of [2] neglected this important circumstance and
were in a hurry to conclude that Hilbert did not derived the gravitation
equations in the form

√g

Rµν −
(cid:18)

(cid:19)

They presented this conclusion to the wide scientiﬁc community in a popular
and well-known journal “Science” [2]. For all that the authors of [2] did not
inform the readers that so-called Proofs are mutilated. Only later, in [3],
they mentioned that. The authors of [2] claim that the Proofs allowed them
to base their point of view “that radically diﬀers from the standard” one.
How could it be done on the basis of a preliminary and multilated material?

17

Here is one more method of “analysis” used by the authors of [3]: “Re-
markably, in characterizing his system of equations, Hilbert deleted the word
“neu”, a clear indication that he had meanwhile seen Einstein’s paper and
recognized that the equations implied by his own variational principle are for-
mally equivalent to those which Einstein had explicitly written down (because
of where the trace term occurs), if Hilbert’s stress-energy tensor is substituted
for the unspeciﬁed one on the right-hand side of Einstein ﬁeld equations.”

But all cited above loses sense because actually their “clear indication”
disappears as D. Hilbert in the published article [6] wrote quite clearly: “I
would like to construct below. . . a new system of fundamental equations”.

It is extremely tactless to produce conclusions on Hilbert’s ideas on the
basis of his marginal remarks in preliminary unpublished materials. The
system of gravitational equations obtained by Hilbert is really the new one.
He obtained it without knowledge that A. Einstein came to the same grav-
itational equations. That is about A. Einstein wrote to D. Hilbert in the
letter of 18 November 1915 (see Section 3). Strange is the way, chosen by the
authors of [3], to base their “radically diﬀerent” point of view. Many-page
composition [3] abounds in both similar doubtful arguments and erroneous
statements. Such an approach to the study of most important physics papers
can be hardly considered as a professional, based on a profound analysis of
the material.

In conclusion of this section let us note, that Hilbert’s papers under gen-
eral title “Grundlagen der Physik” are very important and instructive. It
would be very good if theoreticians, who deal with similar problems, knew
them.

Thus, for instance, an article [17] was published in “Uspekhi”. Should
the authors of this paper read Hilbert’s paper [18], published in 1917, they
would see that the critical coordinate velocity Vc, which they calculated ap-
proximately, is equal in fact to

Vc =

α

r

1
√3 (cid:18)

−
r

(cid:19)

, α = rg = 2GM.

Namely at this velocity the acceleration is equal to zero. Velocity Vc depends
on the radius, while the corresponding proper velocity, v, does not depend
on r and

v =

1
√3

.

18

In order to obtain the critical coordinate velocity Vc in the ﬁrst order in G one
needs to keep in acceleration terms of the second order in G. Gravitational
ﬁeld does not exert an action on a body, if the latter moves with velocity Vc,
under the action of some external force.

absolute value of the velocity obeys to inequality

and further he notes: “The light propagating rectilinearly towards the center
experiences always a repulsion according to the latter inequalities; its speed
increases from 0 at r = α to 1 at r =

”.

Let us note that the local speed of light is equal to c. It is also necessary

to note that the velocity Vc is not a solution of the initial equation.

One more remark. The authors of [17] write:

Maybe this is the reason
why sometimes in the literature the proper time is called “genuine”, or “phys-
ical”. A lightminded person would think that any other time (the coordinate
time) is not physical, and thus should not be considered

≪

.

And further: “As a result some many specialists on general relativity
consider coordinate-dependent quantities as nonphysical, so to say “second-
quality” quantities. However the coordinate time is even more important for
some problems than the proper time τ ”.
So, as the authors of [17] notice:

to speak about the proper time
as a “genuine” or “physical” in contrast with the coordinate velocity is not
logical
In vain the authors of [17] think that specialists in general rel-
ativity do not understand signiﬁcance of coordinate quantities. All the de-
scription in general relativity proceeds in terms of coordinate quantities. One
cannot avoid them in principle. This is well known for a long time.

≫

≪

...

.

≫

As an example of the physical quantity let us take the proper time, which
diﬀers from the coordinate one in that it does not depend on the choice of the
coordinate time. As one sees there is a diﬀerence, and it is quite essential.
Another example is the coordinate velocity of light

here i = 1, 2, 3; ei is a unit vector in the three-dimensional Riemannian
space.

The coordinate velocity V is, certainly , measurable but depends on the

choice of coordinates and can have arbitrary value:

while the physical speed of light is equal exactly to c. As one can see there
is also a diﬀerence, and also very essential.

Therefore there is nothing “non-logical” in the use of notions of physical

and coordinate velocities, contrary to the authors of [17].

2. A. Einstein approach

Einstein wrote in 1913 [8]: “The theory stated in the following arose from the
conviction that proportionality between the inertial and gravitational masses
of bodies is an exact, real law of Nature, which must ﬁnd its expression al-
ready in the basis of theoretical physics. Already in some earlier works I tried
to express this conviction reducing the gravitational mass to the inertial
one; this aspiration led me to the hypothesis that the gravity ﬁeld (homoge-
neous in an inﬁnitesimally small volume) can be physically substituted by an
accelerated frame ”.

Namely this path led Einstein to the conviction that in general case the
gravitational ﬁeld is characterized by the ten space-time functions (metric
coeﬃcient of the Riemann space) gµν

ds2 = gµν(x)dxµdxν.

(51)

≪

He further published a series of papers about which he wrote later in
My eﬀorts in recent years were directed toward basing a
the paper [19]:
general theory of relativity, also for nonuniform motion, upon the supposition
of relativity. I believed indeed to have found the only law of gravitation that
complies with a reasonably formulated postulate of general relativity; and I
tried to demonstrate the truth of precisely this solution in a paper4 [18] that
appeared last year in the “Sitzungsberichte”.

Renewed criticism showed to me that this truth is absolutely impossible to
show in the manner suggested. That this seemed to be the case was based upon
amisjudgment. The postulate of relativity — as far as I demanded it there
— is always satisﬁed if the Hamiltonian principle is chosen as a basis. But
in reality, it provides no tool to establish the Hamiltonian function H of the
gravitational ﬁeld. Indeed, equation (77)l.c. which limits the choise of H says
only that H has to be an invariant toward linear transformations, a demand
that has nothing to do with the relativity of accelerations. Furthermore, the
choice determined by equations (78)l.c. does not determined equation (77) in
any way.

For these reasons I lost trust in the ﬁeld equations I had derived, and
instead looked for a way to limit the possibilities in a natural manner. In this
pursuit I arrived at the demand of general covariance, a demand from which
4Equations of this paper are quoted in the following with the additional note “l.c.” in

order to keep them distinct from those in the present paper.

21

I parted, though with a heavy heart, three years ago when I worked together
with my friend Grossmann. As a matter of fact, we were then quite close to
that solution of the problem, which will be given in the following.

Just as the special theory of relativity is based upon postulate that all equa-
tions have to covariant relative to linear orthogonal transformations, so the
theory developed here rests upon the postulate of the covariance of all
systems of equations relative to transformations with the substi-
tution determinant 1.

Nobody who really grasped it can escape from its charm, because it signi-
ﬁes a real triumth of the general diﬀerential calculus as dounded by Gauss,
Riemann, Christoﬀel, Ricci, and Levi–Civita.

We will show below how close to the true gravitational ﬁeld
equations was Einstein when writing the paper of 4 November
1915 [19].

Since 1913 A. Einstein mentioned, in one or another way, that the quan-
σ, characterizing the gravitational ﬁeld must enter the gravitation
σ, characterizing material

tity tλ
equation in the same way as the quantity tλ
systems.

For instance, he wrote in 1913 in the paper [8]: “...the gravitational ﬁeld
tensor is a source of the ﬁeld on equal foots with that of material systems, Θµν.
Exceptional position of the gravitational ﬁeld energy in comparison with all
other kinds of energy would lead to inadmissible consequences.”. However,
Einstein left aside this important intuituve argument when he wrote the
paper [19].

In fact, the mentioned above consideration on a symmetry between the
quantities T λ
σ is rather a product of Einstein’s intuition, but not a
general physical principle. The matter is that the transformation properties
of these quantities are diﬀerent.

σ and tλ

23

One has to notice that, as a rule, basic physical equations are not derived.
Rather they are guessed on the basis of experimental data, general physical
principles and intuition. That is why it is sometimes diﬃcult to logically
explain in what way they are obtained by an author.

It is easy, with help of (60), to ﬁnd the trace of the quantity tλ

It is seen that there is no symmetry between the quantities T λ

(63). One can easily see that this symmetry can be re-established in a simple
way.

σ and tλ

Consider ﬁrst the conservation laws with help of (63). To this end we

ﬁnd the trace:

Eqs. (73) and (74) arise only from the new equations (72).

In the supplement [20] to the article [19] Einstein makes a further step

and chooses the gravitational equations in the form

−
generally covariant under arbitrary coordinate transformations. He abandons
g = 1 these equations are equivalent
the condition √
to Eqs.(52). But Eq.(52) does not provide neither the symmetry between T λ

and tλ
σ nor the conservation laws. So, it is natural to make the symmetrisation
operations, (70) and (71), in the initial equations (75) as well. In such a way
we obtain a new gravitation equation

to a symmetry breaking between T λ

This sircumstance, probably, satisﬁed him, and he did not pay attention
σ and tλ
However his method to satisfy the conservation laws led to the situation
g = 1 was possible only if the trace of
when the choice of the frame √
the material tensor were put zero. Instead of re-establishing the symmetry
via (70) and (71) Einstein chose another, more radical, way. He pushed
forward a new physical idea [20], that “in reality only the quantity T µ
µ +
µ is positive, while T µ
tµ
µ disappears”. Such an approach re-established the
symmetry. Nonetheless whatever radical, this approach was not fruitful, and
this idea existed but short time.

−

Later Einstein returned to his old idea on symmetry and obtained in
Ref. [5] the gravitational ﬁeld equations (76). He mentioned there: “As it
is not diﬃcult to see, our additional term leads to that energy
tensors of the gravitational ﬁeld and of matter enter Eq.(9) in
the same way”.

There is some inexactitude in this statement. There does not exist,

in general relativity, a gravitational ﬁeld energy tensor.

Nonetheless, due to intuitive considerations, the use of such a quantity

led Einstein directly to his goal.

We see that the way of Einstein led him inevitably to the same equations,
which Hilbert obtained as well. It is quite evident that Einstein obtained
them independently. Moreover, he gained them through much suﬀering dur-
ing several years.

For better understanding of what is written above, of no small importance
is quite a vivid correspondence [9] between Hilbert anf Einstein, which took
place just in the period of their work on the gravitational ﬁeld equations.
Namely this correspondence witness that no “radically diﬀerent” point
of view, other than the standard one, can exist as a matter of principle.

3. Einstein–Hilbert Correspondence

From Einstein to Hilbert

Berlin, Sunday, 7 November 1915

“Highly esteemed Colleague,
With return post I am sending you the correction to a paper in which I
changed the gravitational equations, after having myself noticed about 4 weeks
ago that my method of proof was a fallacious one. My colleague Sommerfeld

26

wrote that you also have found a hair in my soup that has spoiled it entirely
for you. I am curious whether you will take kindly to this new solution.

With cordial greetings, yours

A. Einstein
When may I expect the mechanics and history week to take place in

G¨ottingen? I am looking forward to it very much.”

From Einstein to Hilbert

Berlin, Friday, 12 November 1915

“Highly esteemed Colleague,
I just thank you for the time being for your kind letter. The problem
has meanwhile made new progress. Namely, it is possible to exact general
g = 1; Riemann’s tensor then delivers the
covariance from the postulate √
−
gravitation equations directly.
If my present modiﬁcation (which does not
change the equations) is legitimate, then gravitation must play a fundamental
role in the composition of matter. My own curiousity is interfering with my
work! I am sending you two copies of last year’s paper. I have only two other
intact copies myself. If comeone else needs the paper, he can easily purchase
one, of course, for 2M (as an Academy oﬀprint).

Cordial greetings, yours

Einstein”

From Hilbert to Einstein

G¨ottingen, 13 November 1915

“Dear Collegue,
Actually, I ﬁrst wanted to think of a very palpable application for physi-
cists, namely reliable relations between the physical constants, before obliging
with my axiomatic solution to your great problem. But since you are so inter-
ested, I would like to lay out my theory in very complete detail on the coming
Tuesday, that is, the day after the day after tomorrow (the 16th of this mo.).
I ﬁnd it ideally handsome mathematically and absolutely compelling according
to axiomatic method, even to the extent that not quite transparent calcula-
tions do not occur at all and therefore rely on its factuality. As a result
of gen. math. law, the (generalized Maxwellian) electrody. eqs. as a math.
consequence of the gravitation eqs., such that gravitation and electrodynamics
are actually nothing diﬀerent at all. Furthermore, my energy concept forms

27

P

(ests + eihtih), which is likewise a general invariant, and
the basis: E =
from this then also follow from a very simple axiom the 4 missing “space-time
equations” es = 0. I derived most pleasure in the discovery already duscussed
with Sommerfeld that normal electrical energy results when a speciﬁc abso-
lute invariant is diﬀerentiated from the gravitation potentials and then g is
set = 0.1. My request is thus to come for Tuesday. You can arrive at 3 or
1/2 past 5. The Math. Soc. meets at 6 o’clock in the auditorium building.
My wife and I would be very pleased if you stayed with us. It would be better
still if you came already on Monday, since we have the phys. colloquium on
Monday, 6 o’clock, at the phys.
institute. With all good wishes and in the
hope of soon meeting again, yours,

Hilbert
As far as I understand your new paper, the solution given by you is en-
tirely diﬀerent from mine, especially since my es’s must also necessarily con-
tain the electrical potential. ”

From Einstein to Hilbert

Berlin, Monday, 15 November 1915

“ Highly esteemed Colleague,
Your analysis interests me tremendously, especially since I often racked
my brains to construct a bridge between gravitation and electromagnetics.
The hints your give in your postcards awaken the greatest of expectations.
Nevertheless, I must refrain from travelling to G¨ottingen for the moment
and rather must wait patiently untill I can study your system from the printed
article; for I am tired out and plagued with stomach pains besides. If possible,
please send me a correction proof of your study to mitigate my impatience.

With best regards and cordial thanks, also to Mrs. Hilbert, yours,

A. Einstein ”
16 November 1915 D. Hilbert presented his result publicly. The author

of the paper [21] writes about that:

≪

“Grundgleichungen der Physik” was the title of Hilbert’s lecture to the
G¨ottingen Mathematical Society of November 16. It was also the title under
which his communication in the letter of invitation circulation among the
Academy members between November 15 and the meeting of November 20...

He mentions also:

≫

The invitation for the meeting of 20 November was issued on Novem-
ber 15 and was, as always, circulated among the members to conﬁrm their

≪

28

participation and announce any communications they intended to present
at the meeting. Into this invitation Hilbert wrote: “Hilbert legt vor in die
Nachrichten: Grundgleichungen der Physik.”

“In response to Einstein’s request”, as the author of Ref.[21] notices,
“Hilbert had to report his ﬁndings in correspondence to Einstein,
unfortunately lost. He probably sent Einstein the manuscript of his lecture to
the G ottingen Mathematical Society, or a summary of its main points.”

Einstein to Hilbert

Berlin, 18 November, 1915

“Dear Colleague,
The system you furnish agrees — as far as I can see — exactly with
what I found in the last few weeks and have presented to the Academy. The
diﬃculty was not in ﬁnding generally covariant equations for the gµν’s; for
this is easily achieved with the aid of Riemann’s tensor. Rather, it was hard
to recognize that these equations are a generalization, that is, simple and
natural generalization of Newton’s law. It has just been in the last few weeks
that I succeeded in this (I sent you my communications), whereas 3 years
ago with my friend Grossmann I had already taken into consideration the
only possible generally covariant equations, which have now been shown to be
the correct ones. We had only heavy-heartedly distanced ourselves from it,
because it seemed to me that the physical discussion yielded an incongruency
with Newton’s law. The important thing is that the diﬃculties have now
been overcome. Today I am presenting to the Academy a paper in which I
derive quantitatively out of general relativity, without any guiding hypothesis,
the perihelion motion of Mercury discovered by Le Verrier. No gravitation
theory had achieved this untill now.

Best regards, yours

Einstein ”

Such is the content of Einstein’s reply letter. There does not exist an
argument more forcible than the words in the letter, written by Einstein,
himself: “The system you furnish agrees — as far as I can see
— exactly with what I found in the last few weeks and have pre-
sented to the Academy”. But namely this exact evidence remained aside
in Refs. [2,3,4]. Only one this evidence by Einstein is fairly suﬃcient to

29

exclude completely and forever any attempts to push forward “a point of
view which radically diﬀers from the standard point of view”.

The authors of [2,3] made a whole series of other wrong conclusions about
Hilbert’s paper. That is why we had to consider, in Section 1, their compo-
sitions in some detail.

Let us nonetheless assume that Einstein received from Hilbert the gravi-

tation equations in the form (12), i.e.

[√g R]µν =

∂√g L
∂gµν

,

−

(77)

It is unbelievable that Einstein would consider that that these equations
agreed with his equations

Rµν =

Tµν −
where Ricci tensor enters explicitly. To agree that Eqs. (77) coincide with
his equations (78) Einstein would need to calculate the derivatives

gµνT

∂√g R
∂gµν ,

∂√g R

.

However he did not calculate them that time. He wrote about that later,
in the letter to H.A. Lorentz of 19 January 1916 [9]: “I avoided the somewhat
involved computation of the ∂R/∂gµν ’s and ∂R/∂gµν
σ ’s by setting up the ten-
sor equations directly. But the other way is certainly also workable and even
more elegant mathematically”.

It is also improbable that Hilbert, knowing that Ricci tensor
enters the Einstein equations (he was informed of that in the letter
from Einstein of 7 November 1915), could send him his equations
in the form (77). No doubt that Einstein received from Hilbert the
equations in the form

√g

Rµν −
(cid:18)

gµνR

=

∂√g L

and practically without computations, as we have seen above, the equality

[√g R]µν = √g

Rµν −
(cid:18)

gµνR

.

(cid:19)

30

In the letter to Hilbert of 18 November 1915 Einstein wrote: “The sys-
tem you furmish agrees — as far as I can see — exactly to what
I found...”. It is easy to be persuaded in this if to compare Eqs.(78) and
(79). Einstein’s words “as far as I can see” were possibly caused by that
in Hilbert’s paper the energy-momentum tensor density was deﬁned as

∂√g L
∂gµν ,
where L is a function of gµν, qσ and qσν. Such a deﬁnition was new and
unknown to Einstein. Time needed to understand its essence. But Einstein
replied to Hilbert immediately. Later on, in the paper [22], Einstein would
take advantage of namely such a deﬁnition of the energy-momentum ten-
sor. He, in this paper, introduced, like Hilbert, a function
of variables
gµν, q(ρ), q(ρ)α and wrote down the energy-momentum tensor density in the
form

M

Tµν =

−

∂
∂gµν .
M

Therefore it is impossible to understand on what ground the authors of [3]
try to conclude quite an opposite: “The new energy expression that Hilbert
now took over from Einstein . . . ”. As we have just seen it is absolutely
wrong. Namely Einstein adopted from Hilbert the deﬁnition of the energy-
momentum tensor density and used it in the paper [22].

Furthermore the authors of [3] conclude: “. . . Einstein’s generalization of
Hilbert’s derivation made it possible to regard the latter as merely representing
a problematic special case”.

All this is wrong. Hilbert’s method is general; it allows to obtain the
gravitation equation without assumption on a concrete form of the Lagrange
function L of a material system. Therefore there was no (and could not be)
generalization of the Hilbert inference. This is another story that afterwards
Hilbert applied his method to the concrete case of Mie’s theory.

As we have already mentioned in Section 1, the transformation of (77) to
(79) was not a great labour for Hilbert with help of Theorem III, proven by
him.

So the Proofs, moreover multilated, cannot witness that Hilbert did not

put the gravitational ﬁeld equations in the form (79).

31

Conclusion

The analysis, undertaken in Sections 1 and 2, shows that Einstein and Hilbert
inependently discovered the gravitational ﬁeld equations. Their pathways
were diﬀerent but they led exactly to the same result. Nobody “nostriﬁed”
the other. So no “belated decision in the Einstein–Hilbert priority dispute”,
about which the authors of [2] wrote, can be taken. Moreover, the very
Einstein–Hilbert dispute never took place.

All is absolutely clear: both authors made everything to immor-
talize their names in the title of the gravitational ﬁeld equations.

But general relativity is Einstein’s theory.

Appendix

Below we shall give, with pedagogical purposes, the detailed proof of

Hilbert’s theorems II and III.

Theorem II

If H is an invariant that depends on gµν, ∂λgµν, ∂σ∂λgµν, Aν and ∂λAν, then
for an inﬁnitesimal contravariant vector δxs the following identity holds:

δL(√gH) = ∂s(√gHδxs);

here δL is the Lie variation.

To prove this theorem consider the integral

Let us make an inﬁnitesimal coordinate transformation

S =

d4x√gH.

ZΩ

x′ν = xν + δxν;

32

(A.1)

(A.2)

(A.3)

here δxν is an arbitrary inﬁnitesimal four-vector.

At this transformation the integral remains intact and theoref the varia-

tion δcS disappears:

δcS =

g′H ′

d4x√gH = 0.

The ﬁrst integral may be written as

d4x′

g′H ′ =

g′H ′d4x.

(A.5)

Here J is the Jacobian of the transformation

p

ZΩ

Jacobian of the transformations (A.3) is

J =

∂(x′0, x′1, x′2, x′3)
∂(x0, x1, x2, x3)

.

J = 1 + ∂λδxλ.

(A.6)

(A.7)

Expanding √g′H ′ into the Taylor series one ﬁnds

g′(x′)H ′(x′) =

g′(x)H ′(x) + δxλ∂λ(√gH).

(A.8)

Due to (A.5), (A.7) and (A.8) equality (A.4) assumes the form:

p

p

δcS =

d4x[δL(√gH) + ∂λ(√gHδxλ)] = 0.

(A.9)

The Lie variation is

δL(√gH) =

g′(x)H ′(x)

g(x)H(x).

(A.10)

The Lie variation commutes with partial derivatives:

(A.11)

The Lie variation of √gH is

δL(√gH) = Pg(√gH) + Pq(√gH),

(A.14)

Due to arbitrariness of the volume Ω one gets on the basis of (A.9) the sesired
Hilbert identity:

δL(√gH) + ∂λ(√gHδxλ)

0,

≡

δL(√gH) = Pg(√gH) + Pq(√gH).

over a ﬁnite region of the four-dimensional world. The translation vector δxσ
in (A.3) has to disappear together with its derivatives on the 3-dimensional
border of the region Ω. This implies dissapearing of the ﬁeld variations and
their derivatives on the border of this region. Taking use of the Hilbert
identity (A.15) one ﬁnds:

δL(√gH)d4x = 0.

(A.20)

ZΩ

34

In our case

δL(√gH) = Pg(√gH).

(A.21)

Expression (A.13) can be written in the form

Pg(√gH) =

δLgµν + ∂λSλ,

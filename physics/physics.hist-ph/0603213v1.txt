Abstract

Omission of Bohr’s second postulate permits a derivation of spectral in-
tensity with transition amplitudes Xnn′ = rB (n′3 − n3) /3. The transition
amplitudes serve as upper bounds to quantum mechanical matrix elements.
They also provide insight into the latter in terms of Sommerfeld ellipses and
transition trajectories. The speed of a nascent photon in the region of the
electron transition is addressed and the orbit concept is reinterpreted.

INTRODUCTION

The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom can be regarded as the greatest
coup in quantum physics. With bold assumptions it derives in a few, strik-
ingly simple steps a frequency formula that historically breached the long-
standing mystery of the spectral lines and provided a key to the structure of
the atom. The Bohr model is not without shortcomings though. Chief among
them is its silence on the brightness of spectral lines. The shortcomings have
led to the demise of the Bohr model and its elaboration by Sommerfeld—the
“old quantum theory”—and the subsequent rise of quantum mechanics.

Despite its limitations the Bohr model is still taught in introductory
physics for historical and conceptual reasons and the simple derivation of en-
ergy levels and radiation frequencies. The model is based on two postulates—
stationary states1 and quantum leaps—and the speciﬁc assumption of circu-
lar electron orbits. The stationary states are ﬁxed with quantization condi-
tions,2 leading to orbit size,

The Bohr model treats the transition of the electron from orbit n to n′
as a “quantum leap” with the diﬀerence in orbit energy accounting for the
energy ǫ of an emitted or absorbed photon. The Planck-Einstein relation
associates ǫ with the radiation frequency fnn′,

Combining Eqs. (4) and (2) gives the Balmer formula,

En′ − En = ǫ = hfnn′.

The connection of the “quantum-leap world” inside the atom with clas-
sical electrodynamics outside is established at the “rim” of the atom, that
is, for very large quantum numbers compared to the transition, n and n′ ≫
∆n = n′ − n. In this limit Eq. (5) can be approximated,

Here Eq. (3) has been used to invoke the orbital frequency fn . In a transi-
tion between high neighbor orbits, ∆n = 1, the radiation frequency due to
the quantum jump of the electron becomes practically equal to the electron’s
orbital frequency, fnn′ ∼= fn. The limiting procedure in Eq. (6), whereby
the quantum realm and the macroscopic regime merge, is called Bohr’s cor-
respondence principle.

II. NO QUANTUM LEAPS

What happens if we keep Bohr’s ﬁrst postulate—the (quantized) station-
ary states—but drop the second postulate—the quantum leaps? We then
assume that a transition from quantum state n to n′ is a process of continu-
ously changing action, denoted by a continuous quantum variable ˜n. In this
view the transition of the electron from orbit n to n′ is an intermediate pro-
cess with intermittent orbital frequency f (˜n) = (2Ry/h)/˜n3 and intermittent
radius r(˜n) = rB ˜n2 between rn and rn′. The frequency associated with the
quantum transition is obtained by summation of inﬁnitesimal changes of the
orbital frequency,

The result is the correspondence principle, as in Eq. (6).

The projection of the electron motion in orbit n onto an axis through the

nucleus can be considered an oscillating dipole,

pn(t) = −eXncos(2πfnt),

with amplitude Xn = rn from Eqs. (1) and frequency fn from Eq. (3). By
classical electrodynamics5 ,6 the instantaneous radiative power of an oscillat-
ing dipole is

occurs for the dipole pn(t), Eq. (7), due to its postulated stationary-state
motion.7 However, radiation of frequency fnn′, Eq. (5′), is emitted or ab-
sorbed when a quantum transition occurs. To this end we replace in Eq. (9)
the orbital quantum number n by the quantum-number pair nn′ for the tran-
sition. Taking the time average over a period, hcos2...i = 1/2, the average
radiative power becomes

A pair of quantum numbers, nl, becomes necessary to characterize a
quantum state in Sommerfeld’s extension of the Bohr model by elliptical
orbits10 as well as in quantum mechanics. An (nl) Sommerfeld ellipse has the
same length of semimajor axis, the same binding energy, and the same orbital
frequency as the nth Bohr orbit, Eqs. (1) - (3). However, its semiminor axis
is shorter,

with l = 0, 1, ..., n − 1.

III. RELATIONS WITH MATRIX ELEMENTS

Figure 1 gives a comparison of quantum mechanically calculated matrix
elements, listed in Appendix A, with transition amplitudes between neigh-
boring Bohr orbits, n ↔ n′ = n + 1.
In this case, after expansion and
cancellation, Eq. (11) simpliﬁes to

Xnn′
rB

= n(n + 1) +

1
3

.

(11′)

The value of the transition amplitude Xnn′ is given on the abscissa; the value
of the matrix elements hnl|r|n′l′i on the ordinate, together with a repetition
of the Xnn′. This places the amplitudes Xnn′ of transitions between Bohr
orbits, shown by circles, on the diagonal line in the graph. The data align
vertically in columns, starting with the transition n = 1 ↔ 2 = n′ on the
left, and continue with transitions 2 ↔ 3, etc., until 5 ↔ 6 on the right.

For a given pair of (principal) quantum-number neighbors, n and n′, the
matrix elements hnl|r|n′l′i turn out to be always less than the corresponding

5

transition amplitudes Xnn′. The transition amplitude, Eq. (11), thus serves
as an upper bound for the respective matrix elements.

The selection rule for dipole transitions, ∆l = ±1, permits several possi-
ble transitions11 between states with the same principal quantum numbers,
n ↔ n′, depending on the states’ angular quantum numbers l and l′ = l ± 1.
In Fig. 1 the matrix elements of such transitions, (n, l) ↔ (n + 1, l ± 1) ,
fall beneath each transition amplitude Xnn′ = Xn,n+1, forming the columns
under the diagonal. Let us call the transitions where both quantum num-
bers increase or decrease, (n, l) ↔ (n + 1, l + 1), comutant.12 Their matrix
elements are displayed by pointed area symbols ((cid:3), ♦, △) and connected
with dashed trend lines. In contradistinction, we want to call the transitions
with oppositely changing quantum numbers, (n, l) ↔ (n + 1, l − 1), contra-
mutant. Their matrix elements are displayed by line symbols (x, +, ∗) and
connected with dotted trend lines. All comutant matrix elements end up
above the dash-dotted line in Fig. 1—the “separatrix”—all contramutant
matrix elements beneath.

The top matrix element in each column—just beneath the diagonal—
represents the comutant transition between quantum states of neighboring
principal quantum numbers and the maximum angular quantum numbers,
hnl|r|n + 1, l + 1i = hn, n − 1|r|n + 1, ni.
In terms of Sommerfeld orbits
those quantum states are neighbor ellipses with the largest possible minor
axis, Eq. (13). Their semimajor axes are as long as the radii of the respec-
tive Bohr orbits, Eq. (1), but their semiminor axes are slightly shorter. In
other words, they have the smallest possible deviation from circularity that
quantization permits. Figure 2(a) shows an example.

Proceeding down a given column in Fig. 1—from beneath the diagonal to
above the separatrix—we ﬁnd the comutant matrix elements hnl|r|n + 1, l + 1i,
with l = n − 1, ..., 0. The Sommerfeld ellipses involved in that descending
order are progressively more slender, see Fig. 2(b), culminating in a line
ellipse of the smaller orbit, (n, 0)—(not shown in Fig. 2).

The bottom matrix element in each column of Fig. 1 represents the contra-
mutant transition between quantum states of neighboring principal quantum
numbers and the maximum angular quantum numbers, hnl|r|n + 1, l − 1i =
hn, n − 1|r|n + 1, n − 2i. The corresponding Sommerfeld ellipses again have
the smallest possible deviation from circularity that quantization and contra-
mutant transition permit. But now the neighboring Sommerfeld orbits are
a short fat ellipse and a long slim ellipse confocally penetrating the former

6

one—see Fig. 2(c) for an example.

Proceeding upward a given column in Fig. 1, from the bottom to below
the separatrix, we ﬁnd the contramutant matrix elements hnl|r|n + 1, l − 1i,
with l = n − 1, ..., 1. The Sommerfeld ellipses involved in that ascending
order are again progressively more slender; this time culminating in a line
ellipse of the larger orbit, (n + 1, 0)—(not shown in Fig. 2).

Why are the matrix elements hnl|r|n′l′i always smaller than the corre-
sponding transition amplitudes Xnn′? What aﬀects their value? And why
are the matrix elements for transitions between orbits with maximum circu-
larity at both the top and bottom of the columns in Fig. 1, but those with
minimum circularity next to the separatrix? The deviation of the matrix el-
ements from the transition amplitudes between Bohr orbits can conceptually
be understood in terms of orbit geometry and transition trajectory. We will
ﬁnd that orbit geometry provides a scaling whereas the transition trajectory
gives rise to an interference eﬀect.

Consider an electron orbiting along an (nl) Sommerfeld ellipse. As shown
in Appendix B, its instantaneous acceleration consists of a radial part and a
“centripetal” part,

d2rnl
dt2 − rnl
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
Furthermore, the electron’s average centripetal acceleration is proportional

We ﬁrst discuss the top matrix element in each column in Fig. 1, just
below the diagonal. It represents a comutant transition between neighbor
ellipses with the least deviation from circularity. For these orbits we will, in
an approximate treatment, consider only the average centripetal acceleration,
neglecting the radial contribution. By Eqs. (15), (13) and (1) the ratio of
acceleration in an (nl) Sommerfeld ellipse and the nth Bohr orbit is

According to Bohr’s ﬁrst postulate, no radiation is emitted or absorbed
while the electron keeps orbiting along the (nl) or (n′l′) Sommerfeld ellipse.
However, emission or absorption occurs for an (nl) ↔ (n′l′) transition. It
is reasonable to expect that the average acceleration during the transition
is some average of the average acceleration in both orbits.
In the present
approximation we employ the simplest average—the arithmetic mean.13 It
yields for a comutant, (nl) ↔ (n + 1, l + 1) transition

(17a)

For the top matrix element in each column of Fig. 1, Eq. (17a) is 95% accu-
rate or better. The approximation improves with increasing n—to the right
in Fig. 1—but gets worse with decreasing l—down toward the separatrix. It
ceases for transitions that involve orbits with l = 0 (line ellipses)—next to
the separatrix.

In Fig. 1 the top matrix elements fall on a slightly concave trend-curve
which approaches the diagonal line of the corresponding transition ampli-
tudes Xn,n+1.
In the large-n limit where Bohr’s correspondence principle
holds, the top matrix elements merge with the transition amplitudes be-
tween Bohr orbits, hn, n − 1|r|n + 1, ni ∼= Xn,n+1. This is also obtained from
the approximation (17a) in the large-n limit where l ∼= l + 1 = n ∼= n + 1.

A visualization of comutant transitions between neighbor orbits is facil-
itated by Fig. 2(ab). The electron’s trajectory during a transition between
Bohr orbits (dashed) must be some spiral (not shown) between those circles.
Similarly, the transition trajectory between the Sommerfeld orbits must be
an elliptical spiral, connecting smoothly the outer and inner ellipse. Note
that the larger ellipse completely encompasses the smaller ellipse, akin to
the larger Bohr orbit’s complete enclosure of the smaller one. Therefore a
comutant transition between Sommerfeld ellipses can be considered as essen-
tially a transition between Bohr orbits but geometrically scaled by the ratio
of minor axes, Eq. (17a).

The situation is quite diﬀerent for a contramutant transition, illustrated
in Fig. 2(c). What is a simple inward spiral between Bohr orbits, 4 → 3, now
becomes an “exotic” transition from the long slim to the short fat Sommerfeld
orbit, (4, 1) → (3, 2), where the electron has to move outside the larger ellipse
to reach the smaller one. Thus, in contrast to transitions between Bohr orbits,

8

where the intra-orbital trajectory constructively contributes to the emission
or absorption of radiation, the extra-orbital trajectory in a contramutant
transition diminishes the radiation through partial cancellation. This leads,
qualitatively, to small values of the contramutant matrix elements, falling
beneath the separatrix in Fig. 1.

The pattern in Fig. 1, where the matrix elements at both the top and bot-
tom of each column originate from transitions between the fattest ellipses and
those toward the separatrix from gradually slimmer ellipses, suggests that the
minor-axis scaling holds not only for comutant transitions, Eq. (17a), but
also for the contramutant transitions. Both these inﬂuences—orbit scaling
and cancellation due to extra-orbital transition trajectory—are contained in
an empirical approximation for the contramutant matrix elements,

(17b)

with a fudge factor κ = 1/4. The formula is not derived from any princi-
ples;13 it is devised in analogy to Eq. (17a) but with a negative contribution
for the long slim ellipse. It approximates the bottom matrix elements reason-
ably well—except (2, 1) ↔ (3, 0) which involves a line ellipse. This ﬁnding
may lend support to the notion of counter-radiative eﬀects from extra-orbital
transition trajectories.

To demonstrate both approximations we compare the transition ampli-
tude X34 ≃ 12.3, Eq. (11′), with the two largest matrix elements in the third
column of Fig. 1, that is, h32|r|43i and h31|r|42i, and with the bottom mem-
ber, h32|r|41i. Their fraction of X34 is 83%, 61%, and 11%, respectively. The
scaled fractions, Eqs. (17ab), are 84%, 54%, and 12%. Figure 2(abc) shows
the corresponding elliptical orbits, together with the (dashed) Bohr orbits,
for an assessment of intra-orbital and extra-orbital transition trajectories.

While Eqs. (17ab) approximate well the top and bottom matrix elements
in the columns of Fig. 1, their accuracy deteriorates for the matrix elements
toward the separatrix. The reason is the increasing slenderness of the in-
volved ellipses, culminating in line orbits. The ellipses’ slenderness gives rise
to stronger overtones (higher Fourier coeﬃcients) of the radial oscillations
whose contribution to the acceleration, Eq. (14), have been neglected in the
minor-axis scaling, Eq. (16).

Going beyond the inspection of Sommerfeld ellipses, more quantitative

9

insight into matrix elements is obtained by the shape of the radial wavefunc-
tions, shown, for the three above cases, in Fig. 3(abc). The heavy curve dis-
plays the integrand of Eq. (12); the sum of positive (negative) areas between
the radial axis and the curve above (beneath) visualizes the matrix element.
In a sense the matrix elements can be regarded as resulting from interference
of the weighted wavefunctions—constructive in the case 32 ↔ 43, less so for
31 ↔ 42, and considerably destructive for 32 ↔ 41. It may well be that such
wavefunction interference and the scaled trajectory eﬀects, considered above,
are merely diﬀerent manifestations of the same radiation dynamics.

IV. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

Max Born14 came close to the present approach of continuous changes
inside the atom with his observation that diﬀerential quotients in the large-n
limit of quantum transitions correspond to diﬀerence quotients in the small-n
regime,

The quantity Γ is diﬀerentially related to a classical (continuous) orbital
quantity,

∆Γ

g(˜n) ≡ k

where k is a coeﬃcient of proportionality. The quantization of g(˜n) ap-
proaches in the large-n limit the transition quantity

This is Bohr’s correspondence principle—a generalization of Eq. (6). With
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
the analogy (18), called “Born’s correspondence rule,”15 Eq. (20) generalizes
to

gnn′ = k

∆n = k∆Γ

(21)

for any quantum number n. What Born didn’t do was integrate Eq. (19) to
obtain the numerator of the diﬀerence quotient,

Two speciﬁc examples of Eq. (23) are the above Eqs. (5’) and (11).

V. BIRTH OF A PHOTON

It is tempting to determine the transition analogues of other orbital quan-

tities of the old Bohr model, such as the period of revolution,

Here α ≈ 1/137 is the ﬁne-structure constant and c is the speed of light. By
Eq. (23) the corresponding transition period is

and the transition speed

What is the meaning of these quantities?

vnn′ = αc ln

n′
n

.

(cid:19)

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

The transition period turns out to be slightly longer than the radiation
period, both being bracketed by the period of revolution of the involved
orbits, Tn < 1/fnn′ < Tnn′ < Tn′. The largest discrepancy holds for the
1 ↔ 2 transition, with a ratio of Tnn′/f −1
nn′ ≃ 1.4 . In the limit of transitions

11

between high-quantum number orbits, n and n′ ≫ ∆n, all those periods
merge, in accordance with the correspondence principle.

Classical electrodynamics distinguishes between radiation phenomena near
the source of accelerating charges—the so-called “near zone”—and those
very far from the source—the “radiation zone.” Near-zone eﬀects are in-
stantaneously caused by changes of the source; far-zone eﬀects are retarded.
Clearly, the transition frequency fnn′ and transition amplitude Xnn′, which
together compose the radiative power hSnn′i, Eq. (10), must be quantities
of the radiation zone. In contrast, it seems likely that the transition period
Tnn′ relates to the near zone between orbits n and n′.

That conclusion can hardly be avoided for the transition speed vnn′. For
the 2 → 1 inward electron transition Eq.
(27) gives rise to an outward
transition speed,3 |v21| = |αc ln (1/2)| ≃ |−0.69 v1| , that is, about 70% of the
electron’s ground-state speed v1 = αc, Eq. (25). The transition speed vnn′ is
very slow when the electron transition occurs between high neighbor orbits
but very fast when the electron transits from a high orbit to the ground state.
However, for all practical purposes vnn′ will not exceed the speed of light c.16
These ﬁndings suggest that, with an inward transition of the electron, the
transition speed vnn′ is the (negative)3 average radial speed of the nascent
photon in the near zone, that is, between electron orbits n and n′. By this
interpretation the photon starts from rest, v = 0, at the beginning of the
electron transition. The transition period Tnn′ can be regarded as the time
interval during which the nascent photon “peels oﬀ” (decouples) from the
inward spiraling electron. The fresh photon will keep accelerating beyond
the near zone until it reaches the speed of light c in the radiation zone.

When directions are reversed, the same scenario must describe the “death”
of an absorbed photon. An incoming photon of radiation frequency f12, for
instance, will decelerate as it approaches the near zone. The transition speed,
v21 = αc ln(2/1) ≃ +0.69 v1, represents the (inward) average radial speed of
the moribund photon between electron orbits 2 and 1.

VI. EPISTOMOLOGY

Despite its initial successes (Balmer formula, space quantization, ﬁne-
structure formula) the orbit-based old quantum theory of Bohr and Sommer-
feld had been insuﬃcient in regard to the atom’s magnetic properties (Zee-
man eﬀect), the intensity of the spectral lines, the stability of the hydrogen-

12

molecule ion, H +
2 , and the He atom. As we know now, with the beneﬁt of
hindsight, one of the reasons for these shortcomings was the ignorance of
electron spin. However, in the early 1920s it was suspected, chieﬂy by Pauli,
Heisenberg and Born,17 that the failures of the old quantum theory were
caused by the fallacy of the very concept of electron orbits.

In his article on matrix mechanics Heisenberg18 categorically rejected the
notion of electron orbits as unobservable in principle. In the spirit of pos-
itivist philosophy he instead proposed that any theory in physics should
involve only relationships between fundamentally observable quantities, such
as frequency and intensity of spectral lines. The present approach—a “new
old quantum theory”—obtains both spectral frequencies and intensities from
electron orbits. How is that possible?

It has been pointed out19 that Heisenberg disobeyed his own demand by
invoking fundamentally unobservable quantities—virtual oscillators—in his
theory. Something similar occurs in Schr¨odinger’s wave mechanics where
wavefunctions Ψ play a central role but are, by themselves, unobservable.
The orbit conundrum is readily resolved, though, if we regard quantum or-
bits not as observable spatial descriptions—the notion of “ring atoms” in the
Bohr model or “needle atoms” for l = 0 Sommerfeld orbits contradicts all
experience—but merely as entities to calculate observable quantities. This in-
terpretation gives such virtual orbits in the new-old quantum theory a status
equivalent to the virtual oscillators in matrix mechanics or to the wavefunc-
tions in wave mechanics. It also renders the oft-mentioned incompatibility
of quantum orbits with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle immaterial.

The present modiﬁcation of the Bohr model, with the ﬁrst postulate in
place but the second postulate omitted, regards both the orbital and transi-
tional motion of the electron as continuous processes. They diﬀer merely in
the action variable,20 alluded to in the introduction. Motion on an orbit tra-
jectory is accompanied by constant action, In = nh/2π, and contrary, motion
on a transition trajectory by continuously changing action, I(˜n) = ˜nh/2π. In
place of Bohr’s two postulates we can rephrase their essence more succinctly:
Electrodynamic phenomena occur only in processes with continuously chang-
ing action variable. This automatically exempts the stationary states from
electrodynamics, restricting the latter to quantum transitions. The use of a
continuous quantum variable, ˜n, rules out quantum leaps and instead per-
mits calculus and simple quantum electrodynamics right in the heart of the
atom.

TABLE I. Matrix elements M for dipole transitions between quantum
states nl and n′l′, Eq. (12), here listed as hnl|M|n′l′i. Values, in the unit
of Bohr radius rB, are from Ref. 21 or otherwise calculated by integration
of radial wavefunctions from Ref. 22. The dash-dotted line corresponds to
the separatrix in Fig. 1, with comutant transitions above and contramutant
transitions below.

Appendix B. KEPLER ACCELERATION

Consider Kepler motion of a body along an elliptical orbit. The body’s
Cartesian coordinates are x = r cos α and y = r sin α. The components of its
acceleration are

By Kepler’s second law the areal speed, here expressed in relation to angular
momentum L and mass m of the body, 2dA/dt = L/m ≡ C, is a constant of
the motion,

1A planetary system of an orbiting electron around a massive central nucleus
is, by classical electrodynamics, unstable due to radiative loss according to
the (centripetal) acceleration of the electron charge. No such instability of
atoms is observed though. Bohr resolved this conﬂict with his postulate of
stationary states: Defying electrodynamics, electrons can move in certain
orbits without radiative energy loss. An electron moving in such an orbit
is said to be in a stationary state.

2N. Bohr, Phil. Mag. 26, 1-25 (1913). Bohr gives three alternate meth-
ods of quantization, one of which—quantization of angular momentum,
Ln = nh/2π—is still used to date in introductory physics. That method
fortuitously gives the correct energy levels and radiation frequencies but
disagrees with the experimental values of angular momentum (ignoring
electron spin) by one unit, h/2π. The proper method is the quantization
of action, An = mv2

n = nh.

3Consistent with integration rules it is natural to associate the suﬃx n in
the radiation frequency fnn′ and in other transition quantities—Eqs. (5),
(5′), (11), (26) and (27)—with the electron’s initial orbit and n′ with
its target orbit. On the other hand, it is convenient to regard emission
as a positive entity and absorption as negative. Similarly, mathematical
convention designates radial outward motion as positive and inward mo-
tion as negative. Unfortunately, because of the opposite radial motion of
electron and photon during the transition, the sign of the electromag-
netic transition quantities, obtained from those equations, is opposite to
convienience or convention.

4Note that the Planck-Einstein relation, Eq. (4), is not used in the derivation

of Eq. (5′).

from Sommerfeld’s historical theory to obtain agreement with quantum
mechanics.

11Except for the lowest transition; 1, 0 ↔ 2, 1.

12The terms “co-mutant” and “contra-mutant” are chosen to signify changes
of quantum numbers n and l in the same or opposite direction, respec-
tively.

13The purpose of Eqs. (17ab) is conceptual and only intended to indicate
scaling by orbit geometry and constructive or destructive eﬀects from
transition trajectories.

16Take, for example, an electron transition from a very high orbit N to the
ground state, n′ = 1. By Eq. (27) the transition speed equals the speed
of light c when N = exp(1/α). The radius of that orbit is rN ≈ 10109m—
much larger than the universe!

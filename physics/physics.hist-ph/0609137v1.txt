HOLE THEORY AND QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS IN AN
UNKNOWN FRENCH MANUSCRIPT BY ETTORE MAJORANA

S. ESPOSITO

Abstract. We give an accurate historical and scientiﬁc account of a previ-
ously unknown manuscript written by Ettore Majorana in French. The re-
trieved text deals with Quantum Electrodynamics by using the formalism of
ﬁeld quantization, and it is here reported, for the ﬁrst time, in translation. It
is likely related to an invited talk for a conference at Leningrad (or Kharkov)
in 1933 (or 1934) which, however, Majorana never attended. Probably this
manuscript refers to the last missing papers of the “Senatore folder”, given by
Majorana to one student of his at the University of Naples in 1938, just before
his disappearance.

1. The last papers written by Majorana

Ettore Majorana, born on 5 August 1906, taught from January to March 1938 at the
University of Naples, having obtained the full professorship in Theoretical Physics
“for high and well-deserved fame” [1, 2]. The interest in the course held by the great
Italian physicist, the only one eﬀectively delivered to students [3], has been already
pointed out in the literature (see, for example, Refs. [4], [5]). It is fundamentally
based on the forefront feature with which Majorana characterized his teaching of
Quantum Mechanics. The historical and personal adventure of Majorana, instead,
is centered around his mysterious disappearance at the end of March 1938, exactly
during his stay in Naples. On Friday 25 March (Majorana held his 21st lesson the
day before), according to one of his student, ≪contrary to what he usually did,
Majorana came to the institute and remained there for few minutes... From the
corridor leading to the small room where I was writing, he called me by name: ‘Miss
Senatore...’. He didn’t enter in the room but remained in the corridor; I went to
him, and he gave me a closed folder, telling me: ‘that’s some papers, some notes,
take them.... We will talk about them later’. Afterwards he went away and, turning
around, said again, ‘we will talk about them later’.≫ [6]. That folder contained the
lecture notes for the course on Theoretical Physics prepared by Majorana who, in
that occasion, wanted to give once and for all to one of his student. What remains
of the original papers with those notes was published some years ago [7]. However,
when Senatore looked at such publication, after very many years since 1938, she
pointed out that ≪some chapters of the lectures are missing; their text (completed
by the notes of the lecture the professor would have delivered on the day after his
disappearance) was given to me. A few other sheets are still missing; these were
written in the same original and neat way as the others, but they do not correspond
to the lectures he had already given≫ [6]. The path followed by the original notes
by Majorana from 1938 to 1966, when Edoardo Amaldi deposited them at the
Domus Galilaeana in Pisa together with the other scientiﬁc (unpublished) papers
1

by Majorana, has been quite tortuous, as pointed out elsewhere [4]. Thus it could
be not surprising that some “chapters” have been “lost”. Nowadays, however, we
may safely assert that the whole set of the lecture notes for the Theoretical Physics
course have been recovered [8], thanks to the recent discovery of the Moreno Paper
[4]. This document contains the notes corresponding to six lectures of the given
course, whose original manuscripts are missing.

Instead, with regard to the notes corresponding to what Senatore interpreted as
“the lecture the professor would have delivered on the day after his disappearance”,
a very recent analysis [9] has concluded that they do not refer at all to a lecture of
that course of Theoretical Physics, but rather to the text of a general conference or
seminar probably addressed to the researchers of the Institute of Physics in Naples
itself, certainly not devoted to students.

2. The Senatore folder

About the remaining “few other sheets”, strangely up to now no fruitful research has
been conducted, although a long period elapsed since the time when the Majorana
papers were made publicly available. Such a research is performed now, based
mainly on the papers at the Domus Galilaeana, and the results are here presented
for the ﬁrst time.

The folder with the Naples lecture notes given to Senatore on 25 March 1938

contains now the following documents.

Firstly, the original of a letter written by Gilberto Bernardini to Amaldi on 2
December 1064 (reproduced in Ref.
[7]) is present in it. In this letter Bernardini
replied to Amaldi about his persistent request on the Majorana lecture notes. Ev-
idently, such a letter was added by Amaldi in recent times (around 1966) to the
folder.

The second document1 present in the folder is composed by 22 A4 papers (each
of one corresponding to 4 pages). They are the original notes corresponding to 10
lectures of the Majorana course [8].

The third document is, instead, composed of only 3 papers (each of one cor-
responding again to 4 pages). The text contained in it refers to what mentioned
above regarding the general conference delivered by Majorana (see Ref.
[9]). For
possible future reference, this document of 3 papers will be denoted as “excerpta
Senatore I”.

Unexpectedly, the folder at the Domus Galilaeana contains also another docu-
ment, composed of 2 A4 papers (the ﬁrst one made of 4 pages, while the other one
of only two pages). Such a document, denoted here as “excerpta Senatore II”, is
completely diﬀerent from the excerpta Senatore I (and from the lecture notes), due
to peculiarity of the text, which is written in French rather than in Italian, and to
particular writing details.

The content of the text of this manuscript, reported (translated into English) in
the appendix, concerns about an application of the formalism of second quantiza-
tion to the Dirac’s hole theory (excerpta Senatore IIa) and some topics of Quantum
Electrodynamics (excerpta Senatore IIb e IIc), which will be discussed from a the-
oretical point of view in the following section. However, it is interesting to observe

1The subdivision in terms of “documents” is made here for convenience, but it does not corre-
spond to any real division. Indeed, the folder contains only spare sheets, according to what here
described.

HOLE THEORY AND QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS IN A MAJORANA’S PAPER

at once that, despite the apparent variety of topics, the whole French text present
in the 2 papers seems to have been written in no more than one occasion.

3. The reference theoretical background

In the general framework of Wave Mechanics, basically introduced by Erwin Schr¨o-
dinger, the existence of a “matter quantum”, such as the electron, posed the same
theoretical problems of those implied by the existence of light quanta in the context
of the Maxwell electromagnetic theory. This was clearly noted by Werner Heisen-
berg in 1929 [10]. Indeed, if the fundamental problem related to the existence of
the photons was that of explaining the interference phenomenon, for the electrons
it was that of deducing the quantization of the electric charge starting from the
Schr¨odinger wavefunction.

As well known, the solution to such diﬃculties came out with the introduction
of the ﬁeld quantization (or “second quantization”) procedure that, after a prelim-
inary work by Pascual Jordan in 1926 [11], it was applied for the ﬁrst time by Paul
A. M. Dirac in 1927 [12] to the quantization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The fol-
lowing step was that of considering particles with non vanishing mass, and this was
achieved by Jordan and Oskar Klein [13], who generalized the Dirac quantization
method to bosonic ﬁelds. The procedure to be adopted for fermions, according to
the Pauli exclusion principle, required instead the “invention” of anticommutators,
as pointed out by Jordan and Eugene Wigner in 1928 [14].

The key point was, evidently, the realization that the (Schr¨odinger, Dirac or
Maxwell) wave ﬁeld does not represent a single particle but, on the contrary, an
arbitrary number of particles. To this regard, it is particularly expressive the title
given by Jordan and Klein to their fundamental paper, On the many-body problem
of the Quantum Theory.

The inclusion of the interaction between light and matter in the second quan-
tization procedure was systematically considered in 1929-1930 by Heisenberg and
Wolfgang Pauli [15], who elaborated a ﬁrst theory of Quantum Electrodynamics by
using the lagrangian formalism. In this theory, however, some fundamental prob-
lems began to impose to the attention of the theorists, such as the emergence of an
inﬁnite Coulomb self-energy for the electron and the problem of the negative-energy
states (that is the transition between states with energy E = +mc2 to states with
E = −mc2). Despite the engagement of some of the best theoretical physicists of
that epoch, such problems remained unsolved for a given period of time. In particu-
lar the problem of the negative energy states increased when Ivar Waller [16] proved
that they were eﬀectively required in order to obtain the Thomson classical limit of
the scattering cross section of X-rays from atoms. The Dirac theory of “holes” [17],
interpreted earlier in terms of protons (by following an Hermann Weyl’s conjecture
[18]) and then assuming the existence of positrons as subsequently observed, of-
fered a simple and interesting solution to the problem, as well known. It was thus
introduced the concept of “vacuum” (or, using the words by Dirac, “the normal
state of electriﬁcation”) as a sea of electrons where all the positive energy states
are empty, whilst those with negative energy are all occupied.

The general acceptance of the hole theory was, initially, not unquestioned in-
side the physicists’ community, and still in 1933, after the experimental discovery
of the “antielectron”, Pauli expressed in many occasions his perplexity about it
[19]. A completely diﬀerent viewpoint was instead adopted by Heisenberg who

4

S. ESPOSITO

was favorably impressed by the substantial symmetry, in the Dirac theory, between
processes involving electrons and those involving positrons [20], an idea that will
be later formally recovered by Majorana in his famous article on the Symmetrical
theory of electrons and positrons [21] (whose genesis could, probably, be dated to
1933, when Majorana visited Heisenberg in Leipzig). Heisenberg himself, in fact,
in 1931 elaborated a particularly interesting (for our aims) application, in which
he considered the symmetry between holes and electrons in an occupied atomic
level or in an occupied energy band of a crystal [22] (that is: an application to
an actual case, in contrast to the “vacuum” by Dirac). In this paper Heisenberg
obtained a second quantized hamiltonian expressed in terms of holes (see Eq. (15)
in Ref.
[22]), where some additional one-particle operator terms comes out from
the commutation between two-particle operators. The application to the case of
an atomic level of N electrons containing, however, only n electrons was studied
[22])
in the ﬁrst part of the article, and led to a wave equation (Eq. (17) in Ref.
for N − n holes. In the second part of it, the electron-hole symmetry in the case
of a metal with an “anomalous” Hall eﬀect is instead considered. As already men-
tioned, Heisenberg used the formalism of second quantization, by making explicit
reference to both the general article by Jordan and Klein of 1927 [13] and to that of
Jordan and Wigner of 1928 [14], where the anticommutators for fermions (namely,
electrons and holes) were properly introduced.

In the excerpta Senatore IIa Majorana substantially followed the track left by
Heisenberg in [22], but it is not clear if the author referred to an actual case (as
that of Heisenberg) or, even more interestingly, if his intention was that of for-
mulating a general theory of holes. Indeed, in the opening of the manuscript, the
general assumptions to which Majorana appealed were very clearly and explicitly
asserted, together with the reference point of the method of the “quantization of the
Schr¨odinger equation” (i.e. that of second quantization). As well as Heisenberg,
Majorana obtained the expression of the hamiltonian of the system in terms of
holes, but it is evident that the theory elaborated in this manuscript is incomplete
(or, rather, interrupted)

It is also particularly interesting the “justiﬁcation” that Majorana gave for the
adoption of anticommutators instead of commutators, which he referred to the
particular form of the hamiltonian and to the corresponding equations of motion
to be satisﬁed.

In the excerpta Senatore IIb and IIc,2 instead, Majorana considered a topic that
he frequently studied in his personal research notebooks [23]: if, as recalled above,
the Maxwell theory of electromagnetism should be viewed as the Wave Mechanics
of the photon, then it should be possible to write the Maxwell equations as a Dirac-
like equation for a suitable wavefunction. An alternative model to the theory of
Electrodynamics, based on an analogy with the Dirac theory of the electron, was
already proposed by Oppenheimer in 1931 [24]; the contribution given by Majorana
to this subject has been already discussed elsewhere [25], and we refer there the
interested reader for further inputs related to the second part of the manuscript
considered.

Regarding the excerpta Senatore IIc it is instead particularly interesting to point
out the clear and explicit presentation of the experimental properties of photons,

2Although the same topic is treated in these two pages, it is preferable to introduce a further

subdivision into two parts, since it is evident the lack of connection between them.

upon which the novel formulation of Electrodynamics may be based, related to the
velocity, energy, momentum and spin of photons. Note also that the Dirac-like
equation for the photons reported at the end of the IIc manuscript is substantially
diﬀerent from that considered in the IIb one (and by Oppenheimer). It is applied to
a two-component wavefunction (corresponding to the only two diﬀerent polarization
states of the photon) instead of a three-component one (corresponding to the electric
and magnetic ﬁelds of the associated wave).

4. The composition of the manuscript and a Soviet conference

Unfortunately, the excerpta Senatore are not dated, so that it is diﬃcult, without
suitable assumptions, an accurate analysis of the genesis and composition of the
Majorana work here considered. However, some “reasonable” considerations may
be usefully developed, without forgetting the fundamental point just pointed out.
First of all, based on the kind of writing used, we can certainly exclude a compo-
sition date around that for the university lectures at Naples (1938). Indeed, from a
comparison with other documents present in the archive of the Domus Galilaeana,
especially the original manuscripts of the published articles by Majorana, we de-
duce that some writing details are very similar to those found for the paper in Ref.
[26] of 1932.3

The analysis of the speciﬁc contents of the Majorana manuscript seems to conﬁrm
a composition date not prior than 1932 revealing, for the excerpta Senatore IIa, a
certain dependence on the Heisenberg article in [22] and, for the excerpta Senatore
IIb e IIc, at least the knowledge of the Oppenheimer paper of the same year [24].
These only data, however, lead to generic conclusions, pointing out only a lower
limit on the composition date, and certainly they do not oﬀer hints on the genesis
and the expected use of the manuscript.

Looking at the whole set of papers left by the Italian physicist, conserved not
only in public archives like the Domus Galilaeana, but also in the private one
of the Majorana family, we have found that only another document was written
in French.
It corresponds to a draft of a letter by Majorana in replying to an
invitation to a conference (see the document MX/R1 in [1]). In the following we
give the translation of it:
Dear Sir,

I thank you warmly for your invitation to participate to the next
congress that will take place in Leningrad. I am happy to accept
and to have the occasion of visiting, at the same time, your big and
beautiful country.
I have talked about your invitation with Mr.
Fermi and Mr. Rossi. Fermi is engaged in a course of conferences
in America and cannot participate. Rossi, on the contrary, assured
me that will accept with pleasure to go to Russia.

Dear Sir, receive my hearty greetings together with my warmest

thanks.

Yours

Ettore Majorana

3They are also similar to those of the article in Ref.

[27] of 1928, which would denote a
composition preceding the Heisenberg paper of 1931 [22]. Although such an hypothesis cannot be
completely excluded, based on what noted in the previous section and to what discussed below,
we consider it not very likely.

6

Bruno Rossi
Institute of Physics of the R. University
Padua

Although even this document is not dated, we can deduce some interesting infor-
mation from what reported in it, if properly examined.

First of all, the letter containing the invitation to the conference was directed to
Majorana as well as to Bruno Rossi (and Enrico Fermi), who worked at that time
at the Institute of Physics in Padua. Now, it is known that Rossi was in Padua
since the Fall of 1932, and that in between 1932 and 1933 he worked together with
Fermi (in Rome) on some questions about Cosmic Rays Physics (see the paper in
[28] and its presentation in the book [29] at page 509).

The second important fact regards the mentioned conference, apparently to be
held in Leningrad. In the years considered, the only one conference of interest for
us is the First All-Union Conference on Nuclear Physics [30], whose main topic
was the Physics of atomic nucleus. It was held on 24-30 September of 1933 at the
Leningrad Physico-Technical Institute [31]. Contrary to what asserted in the letter
above, neither Majorana nor Rossi participated to such a conference (as well as to
other ones in the Soviet Union) while, among the others (for example, I.E. Tamm,
V.A. Fock, G.A. Gamov, P.A.M. Dirac, F. Joliot, V.F. Weisskopf) Franco Rasetti,
another member of the “Via Panisperna boys” group, took part to it [31]. It is
even interesting to observe that Dirac participated to this conference with a talk
on the “Theory of the positron” [32], that is exactly the hole theory considered by
Majorana in the mentioned paper.

The date of the Leningrad conference is in agreement also with another important
piece of information contained in the Majorana letter, regarding the absence of
Fermi who was “engaged in a course of conferences in America”. Indeed, in the
August 1933 Fermi, accompanied by Emilio Segr`e, went to the summer school
at Ann Arbor [33] [34], where he was invited to deliver some lectures (the same
happened in 1930 and 1935).

Nevertheless the hypothesis just considered is not free from some diﬃculties,
concerning mainly who eﬀectively suggested to invite Majorana and Rossi to the
conference and when the replying letter was eﬀectively written by Majorana, after
that the invitation arrived in Rome. In fact, regarding the ﬁrst point, the work
by Majorana (and, partially, that of Rossi) was not yet suﬃciently known by the
international community at the beginning of 1933. Instead, for the second point, we
have to recall that Majorana was in Leipzig (and in Copenhagen, but not in Rome)
from January to the beginning of August of 1933 [1], except for the Easter holidays
ranging from the end of April to the beginning of May of that year. Then it seems
unlikely that a visit to Leningrad could be organized only one month before the
conference (in August) or in the short period of the Easter holidays.

The international fame of Majorana in the ﬁeld of Nuclear Physics and, more
in general, in that of Theoretical Physics, increased only after his stay in Leipzig.
Incidentally, we note that Heisenberg publicized a lot the Majorana work (especially

HOLE THEORY AND QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS IN A MAJORANA’S PAPER

7

that on the nuclear exchange forces [35]) in the conferences following the mentioned
visit [36] and, in particular, in the Solvay Congress at Bruxelles of the October
1933, where talks were given in French. The invitation to Majorana and Rossi
(Heisenberg himself, who worked in the ﬁeld of Cosmic Rays Physics too, was as
well a quite good admirer of the Rossi’s papers on this) could then be conceived in
this occasion, and then formalized later.

Taking for grant such an hypothetical occurrence, the conference cited in the
Majorana letter cannot be that of September 1933 in Leningrad. The subsequent
conference in soviet soil was not given in this town, but in the other important center
It was, nevertheless, organized by important
of Kharkov in May 1934 [37] [38].
Russian physicists working in Leningrad, such as A.F. Joﬀe and others. Few non-
Russian physicists took part to this International Conference of Theoretical Physics
(then, a conference not explicitly limited to Nuclear Physics); among the others,
we mention Niels Bohr, Leon Rosenfeld (both were known to Majorana since its
1933 visit to Copenhagen), Ivar Waller and Walter Gordon. It is also interesting to
note that in the year preceding this conference, the physicist Victor F. Weisskopf
worked in the Institute of Kharkov [39] with Lev D. Landau and others, while
Rudolph Peierls usually visited Landau in Leningrad [40]. Both Weisskopf and
Peierls knew quite well Majorana [1], the ﬁrst one was met in Leipzig in 1933 (in
this occasion the pair discussed on Quantum Electrodynamics), while the second
one was met in Rome between the end of 1932 and the beginning of 1933, just
before the visit of Majorana in Germany.

Note that even the absence of Fermi mentioned in the Majorana letter may
be easily accounted by the hypothesis that the considered conference was that of
Kharkov. Indeed, it is known that in the Summer of 1934 Fermi went to South
America, were he held a series of conferences in Buenos Aires, Montevideo and
If we let to interpret literally the words used by Majorana, the
elsewhere [33].
“course of conferences” seems to be more easily referred to that of 1934 in South
America than to that of 1933 in the United States.

Summing up, the likely hypothesis on the date of writing of the mentioned
Majorana letter in French are only two: the ﬁrst one refers to the Nuclear Physics
conference at Leningrad in September 1933, while the second one refers to that of
Theoretical Physics at Kharkov in May 1934.

In both cases, the open problem is the possible relation between such an invita-
tion letter to a conference in the Soviet Union and the writing of the manuscripts
in the excerpta Senatore II. Unfortunately, to this regard, no conclusive supporting
evidence exists. However, by analyzing carefully the life of Majorana [1], no other
occasion seems to imply the possible usage of the French as possible communication
medium, so that it would be likely that some a link between the two documents
exists. If this conjecture is conﬁrmed, then we can reasonably conclude that the
text present in the excerpta Senatore II should be prepared for a possible Majorana
talk at the conference in Leningrad or in Kharkov, although he never took part to
it. And, probably, his non-participation may be well related to the uncompleted
development of the theory present in the excerpta that, as mentioned above, is only
sketched.

5. Conclusions

From a recent recognition at the Domus Galilaeana in Pisa we have realized that in
the folder of the Majorana lecture notes, given by Majorana to one of his student
in Naples in the March 1938, just before his disappearance, some spare papers are
present in it, not belonging to the collection of the given notes. The existence of
such papers was mentioned directly by that student, Gilda Senatore, some years
ago, but till now their eﬀective presence has not been eﬀectively reported. In the
present work we have thus performed, for the ﬁrst time, an accurate analysis of
the cited manuscript (excerpta Senatore II), written by Majorana in French. It is
the only scientiﬁc manuscript written by the author in that language. The content
of it sketches a theory about Quantum Electrodynamics, with the use of the ﬁeld
quantization formalism. In particular, he considers some questions regarding the
hole theory and the formulation of Electrodynamics suggested by Oppenheimer in
analogy to the relativistic Dirac theory of the electron.

From what discussed above, it seems likely to suppose that the text considered
here was elaborated in 1933-1934, probably for a conference in the Soviet Union
(at Leningrad in 1933 or Kharkov in 1934) to which Majorana, though invited to
participate, did not take part to it. In any case, we can reasonably exclude a date of
composition far from the period when Majorana stayed in Leipzig with Heisenberg,
since it seems well documented a certain dependence of the Majorana paper on an
article by the German physicist.

On the other hand, as noted by Weisskopf, who knew Majorana in Leipzig,
≪at that time I was still interested in Quantum Electrodynamics, and there were
two problems to be faced: one was the problem of the positron, whether it really
is contained within the Dirac equation, the problem of the charge conjugation
symmetry, as we say today, and two, the problem of the nuclear force, the beginning
of Nuclear Physics... All discussions focused around nuclear structure on the one
hand and Quantum Electrodynamics on the other≫ [39].

Then Majorana, as well as other brilliant theoreticians of that period, studied
actively both fundamental questions [35] [21], and the excerpta Senatore II are a
further interesting proof. Nevertheless the fact remains that the theory developed
in these excerpta is only sketched and, at the moment, it is not safely to conjecture
on why the great theoretical physicist has not completed his work. Certainly, it
is intriguing that probably Majorana kept with him such papers in Naples after
several years since their writing, and that he likely gave to his student Senatore
before his mysterious disappearance. Further future researches in this directions
may probably put new light on this novel and fascinating question.

Appendix A. The text by Majorana

In the following we report the English version of the text by Majorana identiﬁed as
excerpta Senatore II. We point out that, apparently, the author has probably written
the original text in Italian and then translated it into French or, alternatively, he
did not elaborate directly the text by following the composition rules of the French
language. In few places, when strictly required by clarity, we have added additional
explanatory text between brackets [...].

Excerpta Senatore IIa

Let us consider a system of p electrons and put the following assumptions: 1)
the interaction between the particles is suﬃciently small allowing to speak about
individual quantum states, so that we may consider that the quantum numbers
deﬁning the conﬁguration of the system are good quantum numbers; 2) any electron
has a number n > p of inner [energetic] levels, while any other level has a much
greater energy. We deduce that the states of the system as a whole may be divided
into two classes. The ﬁrst one is composed of those conﬁgurations for which all
the electrons belong to one of the inner states. Instead the second one is formed
by those conﬁgurations in which at least one electron belongs to a higher level not
included in the n levels already mentioned. We will also assume that it is possible,
with a suﬃciently degree of approximation, to neglect the interaction between the
states of the two classes. In other words we will neglect the matrix elements of the
energy corresponding to the coupling of diﬀerent classes, so that we may consider
the motion of the p particles in the n inner states, as if only these states exist.
Then, our aim is to translate this problem into that of the motion of n − p particles
in the same states, such new particles representing the holes, according to the Pauli
principle.

In order to reach our purpose, it is worth to adopt the formalism used in the
method known as that of the quantization of the Schr¨odinger equation. Let us
consider the Schr¨odinger equation:

as deﬁning a classical ﬁeld, taking into account the fact that ψ does not represent
a single particle but, rather, a very large number of particles, in order to neglect
the granular structure of matter. Then, it is useful to highlight such a part de-
pending on the mutual interaction of the electrons in the potential appearing in the
hamiltonian. Let us then put:

multiplied by the factor −h/2πi. The Heisenberg exchange relations will lead us to
consider particles obeying to the Bose statistics, while we are interested in the other
case, namely that of particles obeying the Fermi statistics. As proved by Jordan
and Wigner, to this end we have to change the signs in the Heisenberg relations:

This cannot be justiﬁed on general grounds, but only by the particular form of the
hamiltonian. In fact, we may verify that the equations of motion are satisﬁed to
the best by these last exchange relations rather than by the Heisenberg ones. We
now consider a suitable solution.

Oppenheimer has tried to build such equations with an inductive procedure by
using the experimental properties of the photons.
These properties may be summarized in the following way:
1) the photons move at the speed of light;
2) the energy and the momentum are related each other by the very simple relation:
W = cp;
3) given the strength and the direction of the momentum, two possible polarization
states are present;

4) the photon has a spin that may assume the values ±
along the propagation
axis. For an experimental justiﬁcation of this last postulate, we observe that, when
an atom emits some radiation, its angular momentum around a given z axis changes

h
2π

(or 0) depending on the fact that one or the other of the following

from + to −
transitions takes place:

h
2π

m → m

= m ∓ 1

′

(m → m

= m) .

′

Then, if we observe a photon along the z axis, we can certainly say that such a pho-
ton cannot be due to the last transition, since the intensity of this vanishes along
the [z] axis. On the other hand if the photon lies exactly on the z axis, this cannot
depend on the angular momentum around this axis, so that from the conservation
of the angular momentum of the system we must admit the existence of the spin of

the photon, in a way that it may assume the two values ±
along the propagation
direction. Such an interpretation of the spin of the photon has been proposed for

Since we are concerned with two polarized components, it would be worth to con-
sider a two-component wave theory. Indeed we can build some equations of the
desired form satisfying to the ﬁrst three postulates. These equations are the fol-

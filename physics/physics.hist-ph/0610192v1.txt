Abstract

In October 1924, The Physical Review, a relatively minor journal at the time, pub-
lished a remarkable two-part paper by John H. Van Vleck, working in virtual iso-
lation at the University of Minnesota. Van Vleck combined advanced techniques
of classical mechanics with Bohr’s correspondence principle and Einstein’s quan-
tum theory of radiation to ﬁnd quantum analogues of classical expressions for the
emission, absorption, and dispersion of radiation. For modern readers Van Vleck’s
paper is much easier to follow than the famous paper by Kramers and Heisenberg
on dispersion theory, which covers similar terrain and is widely credited to have
led directly to Heisenberg’s Umdeutung paper. This makes Van Vleck’s paper ex-
tremely valuable for the reconstruction of the genesis of matrix mechanics. It also
makes it tempting to ask why Van Vleck did not take the next step and develop
matrix mechanics himself.

1 Introduction

It is widely acknowledged among historians of modern physics that the famous
Umdeutung [reinterpretation] paper with which Werner Heisenberg (1901–
1976) laid the basis for matrix mechanics (Heisenberg, 1925c) grew out of
a paper he and Hendrik A. (Hans) Kramers (1894–1952) co-authored on dis-
persion theory (Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925). Although hardly impartial
as one of Kramers’ students and his biographer, Max Dresden (1987) calls
the Kramers-Heisenberg paper “the direct, immediate, and exclusive precur-
sor to the Heisenberg paper on matrix mechanics” (p. 275). Martin J. Klein
(1970) is more restrained but does agree that “this work was the immediate
predecessor of Heisenberg’s new quantum mechanics” (p. 31). To understand
the origin of matrix mechanics, one thus has to come to grips with the con-
tents of the Kramers-Heisenberg paper. According to Jagdish Mehra and Hel-
mut Rechenberg, this paper was written “in such a way that every physicist,
theoretician or experimentalist, interested in the subject could understand”
(Mehra and Rechenberg, 1982–2001, Vol. 2, pp. 181). 1 An uniniated mod-
ern reader turning to the Kramers-Heisenberg paper after these encouraging
words is likely to be disappointed. The authors assume their readers to be
thoroughly familiar with techniques, borrowed from celestial mechanics, for
dealing with multiply-periodic systems, including canonical transformations,
action-angle variables, and related perturbation methods. As far as their con-
temporaries in theoretical physics were concerned, this was undoubtedly a
reasonable assumption. So, Mehra and Rechenberg are probably right to the
extent that the intended audience would have had no special diﬃculties with
the paper. The same cannot be said for most modern readers, who no longer
have the relevant techniques at their ﬁngertips. Fortunately, there is another
paper from the same period covering some of the same terrain that is much
easier to follow for such readers.

Immediately preceding the translation of (Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925) in
the well-known anthology on the development of matrix mechanics edited by
Bartel Leendert van der Waerden (1903–1996) (1968), there is a paper by
the American theoretical physicist John Hasbrouck Van Vleck (1899–1980)
(1924b). Like the Kramers-Heisenberg paper, it combines some sophisticated
classical mechanics with the correspondence principle of Niels Bohr (1885–
1962) and the quantum radiation theory of Albert Einstein (1879–1955). The
last section of this paper provides the ﬁrst published proof that the Kramers
dispersion formula, which Kramers (1924a,b) had only presented in two short

1 This multi-volume history of quantum physics brings together a wealth of infor-
mation and we shall frequently refer to it. However, it needs to be used with some
caution (see, e.g., notes 5, 73, and 166 below as well as the review of the ﬁrst few
volumes by John L. Heilbron (1985)).

notes in Nature at that point, merges with the classical formula in the limit
of high quantum numbers. Van Vleck’s paper is a paragon of clarity. In an in-
terview by Thomas S. Kuhn for the Archive for History of Quantum Physics
(AHQP) in 1963, 2 Van Vleck acknowledged the inﬂuence of his father, the
mathematician Edward Burr Van Vleck (1863–1943), in developing his excep-
tionally lucid writing style:

My father got after me for my very poor style of scientiﬁc exposition. I
feel I owe a great deal to him for his splitting up my sentences into shorter
sentences, avoiding dangling participles—i.e., tightening up my prose style—
the same kind of drill I try to give my own graduate students now. 3

Van der Waerden only included the quantum part, (Van Vleck, 1924b), of
a two-part paper in his anthology. In the second part, Van Vleck (1924c)
clearly laid out the results from classical mechanics needed to understand
the ﬁrst part as well as those parts of (Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925) that
are most important for understanding Heisenberg’s Umdeutung paper. This is
true even though Van Vleck only covered coherent scattering—i.e., the case
in which the frequency of the scattered radiation is the same as that of the
incoming radiation—whereas a large part of the Kramers-Heisenberg paper is
devoted to incoherent scattering, ﬁrst predicted in (Smekal, 1923) and veriﬁed
experimentally a few years later (Raman, 1928; Landsberg and Mandelstam,
1928). In his interview with Kuhn, Heisenberg emphasized the importance of
this part of his paper with Kramers for the Umdeutung paper. 4 Of course,
this is also the one part to which Heisenberg materially contributed. 5 Still,
the non-commutative multiplication rule introduced in the Umdeutung paper
may well have been inspired, as Heisenberg suggests, by manipulations in this
part of the Kramers-Heisenberg paper. To understand where the arrays of

2 Between February 1962 and May 1964, about 95 people were interviewed for the
project (Kuhn et al., 1967, p. 3). With one exception (see sec. 2.4) the exact dates
of these interviews are unimportant for our purposes and will not be given when we
quote from the transcripts.

(Fellows, 1985, p. 57). Van Vleck is talking speciﬁcally about the summer of 1925,
when he was working on his book-length (Van Vleck, 1926), but his father had
probably given him a few pointers before. (Van Vleck, 1924b) deﬁnitely belies the
author’s harsh judgment of his earlier writing style.

with Heisenberg.
5 According to Dresden (1987, pp. 273–274), Kramers added Heisenberg’s name to
(Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925) mainly as a courtesy. For Heisenberg’s side of the
story, see pp. 15–18 of the transcript of session 4 of the AHQP interview with Heisen-
berg, several passages of which can be found in (Mehra and Rechenberg, 1982–2001,
Vol. 2, pp. 178–179), although the authors cite their own conversations with Heisen-
berg as their source (cf. the foreword to Vol. 2).

numbers subject to this rule come from, however, it suﬃces to understand
how coherent scattering is treated in Kramers’ dispersion theory: indeed, the
only explicit use of dispersion theory in the Umdeutung paper is the result for
coherent scattering.

1.1 On the verge of Umdeutung

As in the case of (Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925), one is struck in hindsight
by how close (Van Vleck, 1924b,c) comes to anticipating matrix mechanics.
During the AHQP interview, Kuhn reminded Van Vleck of a remark he had
made two years earlier to the eﬀect that, if he had been “a little more percep-
tive,” he “might have taken oﬀ from that paper to do what Heisenberg did.”
“That’s true,” Van Vleck conceded, but added with characteristic modesty:
“Perhaps I should say considerably more perceptive.” 6 In the biographical
information he supplied for the AHQP, Van Vleck noted:

In the two or three years after my doctorate . . . my most signiﬁcant paper
was one on the correspondence principle for absorption . . . It was some-
what related to considerations based on the correspondence principle that
led Heisenberg to the discovery of quantum mechanics, but I did not have
suﬃcient insight for this. 7

This modest assessment is reﬂected in the discussion of the relation between
Van Vleck’s work and matrix mechanics by Fred Fellows (1985, pp. 74–81),
who wrote a superb dissertation covering the ﬁrst half of Van Vleck’s life and
career. In a biographical memoir about his teacher and fellow Nobel laureate,
Phil Anderson (1987) 8 is less reserved: “This paper comes tantalizingly close
to the kind of considerations that led to Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics” (p.
506).

6 See p. 24 of the transcript of the ﬁrst session of the interview. Kuhn’s recollection
is that Van Vleck’s earlier remark was made during a meeting in Philadelphia in
February 1961 to plan for the AHQP project (Kuhn et al., 1967, pp. vii–viii). It was
only natural for Van Vleck to get involved in Kuhn’s project. As a young physicist
right after World War II, Kuhn had worked with Van Vleck (Anderson, 1987, p.
518), a collaboration that resulted in a joint paper (Kuhn and Van Vleck, 1950).
7 Biographical information prepared for the American Institute of Physics project
on the history of recent physics in the United States (included in the folder on Van
Vleck in the AHQP), p. 1.
8 Van Vleck, Anderson, and Sir Nevill Mott shared the 1977 Nobel prize “for their
fundamental theoretical investigations of the electronic structure of magnetic and
disordered systems.” Van Vleck won for work begun in the early 1930s that earned
him the title of “father of modern magnetism.”

4

Van Vleck did not pursue his own research any further in 1924 and instead
spent months writing—and, as he jokingly put it, being a “galley slave”
(Fellows, 1985, p. 100) of—a Bulletin for the National Research Council (NRC)
on the old quantum theory (Van Vleck, 1926). With his masterful survey he
would surely have rendered a great service to the American physics commu-
nity had it not been for the quantum revolution of 1925–1926. Like the better-
known Handbuch article by Wolfgang Pauli (1900–1958) (1926), the Bulletin
was, as Van Vleck (1971) recognized, “in a sense . . . obsolete by the time it
was oﬀ the press” (p. 6). 9 One is left wondering what would have happened,
had the young assistant professor at the University of Minnesota continued
to ponder the interaction between radiation and matter and the correspon-
dence principle instead of fulﬁlling his duties as a newly minted member of
the American physics community.

That Kramers and Van Vleck—and, one may add, Max Born (1882–1970)
and Pascual Jordan (1902–1980)—came so close to beating Heisenberg to the
punch makes the birth of matrix mechanics reminiscent of the birth of special
relativity. The comparison seems apt, even though none of these authors an-
ticipated as much of the new theory as H. A. Lorentz (1853–1928) and Henri
Poincar´e (1854–1912) did in the case of relativity. 10 Heisenberg (1971, p. 63)
himself actually compared his Umdeutung paper to Einstein’s relativity paper
(Einstein, 1905). He argued that what his work had in common with Einstein’s
was its insistence on allowing only observable quantities into physical theory.
The analogy is considerably richer than that.

The breakthroughs of both Einstein and Heisenberg consisted, to a large ex-
tent, in reinterpreting elements already present in the work of their predeces-
sors, extending the domain of application of these elements, and discarding
unnecessary scaﬀolding. Einstein recognized the importance of Lorentz invari-
ance beyond electromagnetism, reinterpreted it as reﬂecting a new space-time
structure, and discarded the ether (Janssen, 2002). In the case of (Heisenberg,
1925c), the element of Umdeutung or reinterpretation is emphasized in the ti-
tle of the paper. Heisenberg reinterpreted elements of the Fourier expansion of
the position of an electron entering into the construction of the Kramers dis-
persion formula, discarded the orbits supposedly given by that position, and
recognized that the non-commuting arrays of numbers associated with tran-
sitions between diﬀerent states and representing position in his new scheme
were meaningful far beyond the dispersion theory from which they originated.

9 For the reception of Van Vleck’s Bulletin, see (Fellows, 1985, pp. 88–89). Van
Vleck’s Bulletin and Pauli’s Handbuch article were not the only treatises on the old
quantum theory that were out of date before the ink was dry. (Born, 1925) and
(Birtwistle, 1926), two books on atomic mechanics, suﬀered the same fate.
10 In his autobiography, Born (1978, pp. 216–217) exaggerated how close he came
to matrix mechanics before Heisenberg.

5

A further point of analogy is that neither Einstein nor Heisenberg presented
the new theory in a particularly elegant mathematical form. In the case of rela-
tivity, this had to await the four-dimensional geometry of Hermann Minkowski
(1864–1909) and the theory’s further elaboration in terms of it by Arnold Som-
merfeld (1868–1951), Max Laue (1879–1960), and others (Janssen and Mecklenburg,
2006). Even so, a modern reader will have no trouble recognizing special rela-
tivity in Einstein’s 1905 paper. The same reader, however, will probably only
start recognizing matrix mechanics in two follow-up papers to the Umdeutung
paper, (Born and Jordan, 1925b) and (Born, Heisenberg, and Jordan, 1925),
the famous Dreim¨annerarbeit. 11 Born ﬁrst recognized that Heisenberg’s new
non-commuting quantities are matrices. Born and Jordan ﬁrst introduced the
familiar commutation relations for position and momentum. In the Umdeu-
tung paper Heisenberg had used the Thomas-Kuhn sum rule, a by-product of
the Kramers dispersion formula, as his fundamental quantization condition.
As we shall see, Van Vleck had actually been the ﬁrst to ﬁnd the sum rule,
although he did not publish the result.

In the collective memory of the physics community, major discoveries under-
standably tend to get linked to singular events even though they are almost
invariably stretched over time. The “discovery” of the electron by J. J. Thom-
son (1856–1940) in 1897 or the “discovery” of the quantum of action by Max
Planck (1858–1947) in 1900 are well-known examples of this phenomenon.
Special relativity is another good example of a “discovery” that came to be
associated with a single ﬂash of insight, Einstein’s recognition of the relativity
of simultaneity, and a single emblematic text, “On the electrodynamics of mov-
ing bodies” (Einstein, 1905). Much the same can be said about Heisenberg’s
famous trip to Helgoland in June 1925 to seek relief from his seasonal allergies
and the Umdeutung paper resulting from his epiphany on this barren island.
The way in which such stories become part of physics lore can be seen as a
manifestation of what Robert K. Merton (1968) has dubbed the “Matthew
eﬀect,” the disproportional accrual of credit to individuals perceived (some-
times retroactively) as leaders in the ﬁeld. 12 We do, of course, recognize the
singular importance of the contributions of Einstein to special relativity and
of Heisenberg to matrix mechanics. But there is no need to exaggerate the ex-
tent of their achievements. They may have been the ﬁrst to enter the promised
land, to use another admittedly strained biblical metaphor, but they would

11 During a lunch break in his AHQP interview, Alfred Land´e (1888–1976) told
Heilbron and Kuhn: “Heisenberg stammered something. Born made sense of it”
(p. 10a of the transcript of sessions 1–4 of the interview; cf. note 168). Kuhn and
Heilbron report that they wrote this down right after the conversation took place
and call it a “Quasi-Direct Quote.”
12 The eﬀect is named for the following passage from the Gospel According to St.
Matthew: “For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have in abun-
dance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.”

never have laid eyes on it without some Moses-ﬁgure(s) leading the way.

In his biography of Kramers, Dresden makes a convincing case that his sub-
ject deserves more credit for matrix mechanics than he received: “Kramers
certainly hoped and probably expected to be the single author of the Kramers-
Heisenberg paper. It is probably futile to speculate how the credit for the dis-
covery of matrix mechanics would have been distributed in that case. There
would be an indispensable preliminary paper by Kramers alone, followed by
a seminal paper by Heisenberg; this might well have altered the balance of
recognition” (Dresden, 1987, p. 252). Citing this passage, Dirk ter Haar (1998,
p. 23), like Dresden one of Kramers’ students, raises the question whether
Kramers would have shared Heisenberg’s 1932 Nobel prize in that case. In a
review of Dresden’s book, however, Nico van Kampen, another one of Kramers’
students, takes issue with the pattern of “near misses” that Dresden (1987,
pp. 446–461) sees in Kramers’ career, the discovery of matrix mechanics being
one of them (Dresden, 1987, 285–288). Van Kampen asks: “Is it necessary
to explain that, once you have, with a lot of sweat and tears, constructed a
dispersion formula on the basis of the correspondence principle, it is not pos-
sible to forget that background and that it takes a fresh mind to take the next
step?” (Van Kampen, 1988). Similar claims can be made and similar questions
can be raised in the case of Van Vleck, even though his work, unlike that of
Kramers, did not directly inﬂuence Heisenberg. It did, however, by their own
admission, strongly inﬂuence Born and Jordan.

Van Vleck’s contribution has receded even further into the background in the
history of quantum mechanics than Kramers’. (Van Vleck, 1924b,c) is not dis-
cussed in any of the currently standard secondary sources on quantum disper-
sion theory and matrix mechanics, such as (Jammer, 1966), (Dresden, 1987),
or (Darrigol, 1992). Nor is it mentioned in Vol. 2 of (Mehra and Rechenberg,
1982–2001) on the discovery of matrix mechanics, although it is discussed
brieﬂy in Vol. 1 (pp. 646–647) on the old quantum theory. 13 That he worked
in faraway Minnesota rather than in Copenhagen or G¨ottingen, we surmise, is
a major factor in this neglect of Van Vleck. Whatever the reason, the neglect
is regrettable. For a modern reader, it is much easier to see in (Van Vleck,
1924b,c) than in (Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925) or in (Born, 1924) that ma-
trix mechanics did not come as a bolt out of the blue, but was the natural
outgrowth of earlier applications of the correspondence principle to the inter-
action of radiation and matter.

13 It is also mentioned in (Van der Waerden and Rechenberg, 1985, pp. 330–331)
and in (Hund, 1984, pp. 131–132). As noted in (Mehra and Rechenberg, 1982–2001,
Vol. 6, p. 348, note 407), Van Vleck’s work is discussed prominently in a paper by
Hiroyuki Konno (1993) on Kramers’ dispersion theory.

7

Aitchison et al. (2004) have recently given a detailed reconstruction of the no-
toriously opaque mathematics of (Heisenberg, 1925c). By way of motivating
their enterprise, they quote the confession of Steven Weinberg (1992) that he
has “never understood Heisenberg’s motivations for the mathematical steps in
his paper” (p. 67; our emphasis). These authors clearly explain the mathemat-
ical steps. The motivations for these steps, however, cannot be understood,
we submit, without recourse to the dispersion theory leading up to his paper.
And if we want to retrace Heisenberg’s steps on his sojourn to Helgoland, Van
Vleck may well be our best guide.

1.2 Structure of our paper

Like Van Vleck’s 1924 paper, our paper comes in two parts, the second pro-
viding the technical results needed to understand the ﬁrst in full detail. To
provide some context for Van Vleck’s work, undertaken far from the European
centers in quantum theory, we begin Part One by addressing the question of
America’s “coming of age” in theoretical physics in the 1920s (sec. 2). In sec.
3, we relate the story of how matrix mechanics grew out of dispersion theory
in the old quantum theory, drawing on the extensive secondary literature on
this episode as well as on the materials brought together in the AHQP. This
story is usually told from a Eurocentric perspective. Following our discussion
in sec. 2, we shall look at it from a more American vantage point. Discus-
sion of the famous BKS theory (Bohr, Kramers, and Slater, 1924a), which is
prominently mentioned in many papers on dispersion theory in 1924–1925,
is postponed until sec. 4. In this context we shall pay special attention to
the role of Van Vleck’s fellow graduate student at Harvard, John C. Slater
(1900–1976). 14 The reason for keeping the discussion of BKS separate from
the discussion of dispersion theory is that we want to argue that the rise and
fall of BKS was largely a sideshow distracting from the main plot line, which
runs directly from dispersion theory to matrix mechanics. In hindsight, BKS
mainly deserves credit for the broad dissemination of its concept of ‘virtual
oscillators.’ Contrary to widespread opinion, both among contemporaries and
among later historians, these virtual oscillators did not originate in the BKS
theory. They were introduced the year before, under a diﬀerent name and in
the context of dispersion theory, by the Breslau physicists Rudolf Ladenburg
(1882–1952) and Fritz Reiche (1883–1969), who called them ‘substitute oscila-
tors’ [Ersatzoszillatoren 15 ] (Ladenburg and Reiche, 1923, p. 588, p. 590). This
paper is important in its own right and underscores the key achievement of Van
Vleck’s two-part paper. Both Van Vleck (1924b,c) and Ladenburg and Reiche
(1923) used the correspondence principle to construct quantum expressions

14 On Slater, see, e.g., (Schweber, 1990).
15 We follow the translation used in (Konno, 1993, e.g., 139).

for emission, absorption, and dispersion. Van Vleck provides impeccable con-
structions of all three; Ladenburg and Reiche made serious errors in the case
of both dispersion and absorption. The expertise Van Vleck had gained in
classical mechanics by working on the problem of helium in the old quantum
theory (Van Vleck, 1922a,b) put him in an ideal position to correct these er-
rors. We suggest that, at least in part, he may have wanted to do just that
with (Van Vleck, 1924b,c). 16

In sec. 5, the ﬁrst section of Part Two, we give an elementary and self-contained
presentation, following (Van Vleck, 1924b,c), of the technical results on which
our narrative in secs. 3 and 4 rests. In particular, we use canonical perturbation
theory in action-angle variables to derive a classical formula for the dispersion
of radiation by a charged harmonic oscillator and apply the correspondence
principle to that formula to obtain the famous Kramers dispersion formula for
this special case. This ﬁlls an important pedagogical gap in the historical liter-
ature. Given the central importance of the Kramers dispersion formula for the
development of quantum mechanics, it is to be lamented that there is no ex-
plicit easy-to-follow derivation of this result in the extensive literature on the
subject. In the later parts of sec. 5 and in sec. 6, we take a closer look at Van
Vleck’s main concerns in his 1924 paper, which was absorption rather than
dispersion and the extension of results for the special case of a charged har-
monic oscillator (which suﬃces to understand how matrix mechanics grew out
of dispersion theory) to arbitrary non-degenerate multiply-periodic systems.
In sec. 7, we present a simple modern derivation of the Kramers dispersion
formula and related results, which we hope will throw further light on deriva-
tions and results in secs. 5 and 6 as well as on the narrative in secs. 3 and 4.
Finally, in sec. 8, we bring together the main conclusions of our investigation.

2 Americans and quantum theory in the early 1920s

“[A]lthough we did not start the orgy of quantum mechanics, our young the-
orists joined it promptly” (Van Vleck, 1964, p. 24). 17 This is how our main
protagonist, known to his colleagues simply as ‘Van’, described the American
participation in the quantum revolution of the mid-1920s for an audience in
Cleveland in 1963. Van Vleck spoke as the ﬁrst recipient of an award named
for America’s ﬁrst Nobel prize winner in physics, Albert A. Michelson (1825–
1931). He was fond of the “orgy”-metaphor, which he had picked up from the
German-American physicist Ralph Kronig (1904–1995). In his Michelson ad-
dress he mentioned how he had used it oﬀ-handedly a few years earlier during

16 (Ladenburg, 1921) and (Ladenburg and Reiche, 1923) are cited in (Van Vleck,
1924b, p. 339).
17 Quoted and discussed in (Coben, 1971, p. 456)

a press conference at Harvard on Russian contributions to science, only to
ﬁnd himself quoted in a newspaper as saying that there had been a “Russian
orgy in theoretical physics” (ibid.). He was selling himself and his countrymen
short, however, by characterizing the American contribution to the quantum
revolution as simply a matter of joining an orgy started by the Europeans and
in full swing by the time the Americans arrived on the scene.

Eight years later, Van Vleck, in fact, took exception to what sounds like a
similar characterization given by another leading American physicist of his
generation, Isidor I. Rabi (1898–1988). Van Vleck quoted a comment that
Rabi made in a TV documentary about Enrico Fermi (1901–1954):

We had produced a large number of people who had been brought up to
a certain level, then needed some help, some leadership to get over the
hump. Once they were over the hump they were tremendous. People of my
generation brought them over the hump, largely from attitudes, tastes, and
developments which we had learned in Europe (Van Vleck, 1971, p. 7).

As Kuhn and others have emphasized, Rabi’s point was that American physi-
cists returning from Europe rather than European ´emigr´es were mainly re-
sponsible for the coming of age of American physics. 18 This issue has been
hotly debated in the history of physics literature. 19 Our study of some early
American contributions to quantum theory supports the observation by Sam
Schweber (1986) that in the 1930s theoretical physics was “already a thriv-
ing enterprise in the United States. The refugee scientists resonated with and
reinforced American strength and methods: they did not create them” (p. 58).

Commenting on Rabi’s remark, Van Vleck (1971) reiterated the point of his
Michelson address that “quantum mechanics was a basically European dis-
covery” (p. 6). In 1928, he had likewise characterized it as “the result of
the reaction of mind on mind among European talent in theoretical physics”
(Van Vleck, 1928, p. 467). In 1971, however, he added that “there has been
too much of an impression that American physicists, even in the application
of quantum mechanics, were eﬀective only because they had the aid of Euro-
pean physicists, either by going to Europe, or because of their migration to
America” (Van Vleck, 1971, p. 6). Van Vleck, who was proud to be a tenth-
generation American, 20 received his entire education in the United States.

18 See p. 20 of the transcript of the last of ﬁve sessions of Kuhn’s AHQP interview
with George E. Uhlenbeck (1900–1988).
19 For a concise summary and detailed references to the older literature, see (Moyer,
1985, pp. 171–173). Whereas our focus will be on American contributions to atomic
physics, Assmus (1992, 1999) has argued that American theoretical physics came of
age in molecular physics (cf. note 43 below).
20 He could trace his ancestry back to the ﬁfteenth century, to a certain Johan van
Vleeck of Maastricht. One of the latter’s descendants, Tielman van Vleeck (or von

He hardly had any contact with European physicists before 1925, although he
did meet a few on a trip to Europe with his parents in the summer of 1923.
In Copenhagen, he called on Bohr, who suggested that he get in touch with
Kramers, 21 Bohr’s right-hand man throughout the period of interest to us.
Kramers was not in Denmark at the time but in his native Holland. Decades
later, when he received the prestigious Lorentz medal from the Koninklijke
Akademie van Wetenschappen in Amsterdam, Van Vleck recalled how he had
searched for Kramers high and low. After he had ﬁnally tracked him down—
it can no longer be established whether this was in Bergen aan Zee or in
Schoorl—the two men went for a long walk in the dunes along the North-Sea
coast: “This was the beginning of a friendship that lasted until his passing in
1952” (Van Vleck, 1974, p. 9). Unfortunately, Van Vleck does not tell us what
he and Kramers talked about.

2.1 Education

Van Vleck learned the old quantum theory of Bohr and Sommerfeld at Harvard
as one of the ﬁrst students to take the new course on quantum theory oﬀered
by Edwin C. Kemble (1889–1984), the ﬁrst American physicist to write a
predominantly theoretical quantum dissertation. Kemble, Van Vleck (1992)
wrote in a biographical note accompanying the published version of his Nobel
lecture, “was the one person in America at that time qualiﬁed to direct purely
theoretical research in quantum atomic physics” (p. 351). Kemble’s course
roughly followed (Sommerfeld, 1919), the bible of the old quantum theory.
Van Vleck supplemented his studies by reading (Bohr, 1918) and (Kramers,
1919) (Fellows, 1985, p. 17).

Van Vleck was part of a remarkable cohort of young American quantum the-
orists, which also included Slater, Gregory Breit (1899–1981), Harold C. Urey
(1893–1981), and David M. Dennison (1900–1976). Just as Van Vleck was the
ﬁrst to write a purely theoretical dissertation at Harvard in 1922, Dennison
was the ﬁrst to do so at the University of Michigan in 1924. 22 Dennison could
take advantage of the presence of Oskar Klein (1894–1977), an early associate
of Bohr, 23 who was a visiting faculty member in the physics department in
Michigan from 1923 to 1925 (Sopka, 1988, p. 321). This is where Klein came
up with what is now known as the Klein-Gordon equation; it is also where he
made his contribution to what is now known as the Kaluza-Klein theory. 24

Reminiscences about the early days of quantum physics in the United States
can be found in (Van Vleck, 1964, 1971) and in (Slater, 1968, 1973, 1975).
It is also an important topic of conversation in the AHQP interviews with
Van Vleck, Slater, Dennison, and Kemble in the early 1960s. These interviews
need to be handled with care. In the case of Slater and Van Vleck, one can say,
roughly speaking, that the former had a tendency to exaggerate the impor-
tance of American contributions, especially his own, while the latter tended
to downplay their importance. In sharp contrast, for instance, to the modest
remarks by Van Vleck quoted in sec. 1.1, Slater boasted that he “was really
working toward quantum mechanics before quantum mechanics came out. I’m
sure if it was delayed a year or so more, I would have got it before the others
did.” 25

The older generation—men such as Michelson and Robert A. Millikan (1868–
1953)—recognized that the United States badly needed to catch up with Eu-
rope in quantum physics. The Americans were already doing ﬁrst-rate exper-
imental work. One need only think of Millikan (1916) verifying the formula
for the photo-electric eﬀect (Stuewer, forthcoming) or of Arthur H. Compton
(1892–1962) (1923) producing strong evidence for the underlying hypothesis of
light quanta (Stuewer, 1975). Theory, however, was seriously lagging behind.
In 1963, Van Vleck’s teacher, Ted Kemble, recalled:

[T]he only theoretical physicists in the country at that time were really men
on whom the load of teaching all the mathematical physics courses lay, and
they all spent their time teaching. It wasn’t, as I remember, a constructive
occupation. 26

The one theorist who, in Kemble’s estimation, was active in research in classi-
cal physics, Arthur Gordon Webster (1863–1923), was never able to make the
transition to quantum theory. Webster, Kemble said,

just couldn’t keep up with what was going on when the quantum theory
began. I always understood that the reason he killed himself was simply
because he discovered that suddenly physics had gone oﬀ in a new direction
and he was unable to follow, and couldn’t bear to take a seat in the back
and be silent. 27

When quantum theory arrived on the scene, some experimentalists tried their
hands at teaching it themselves (Coben, 1971, p. 444). In this climate, young
American physicists with a knack for theory became a hot commodity. They
received fellowships to learn the theory at the feet of the masters in Europe

2.2 Postdocs and faculty positions

The careers of the young theorists listed above amply illustrate the new op-
portunities in the mid-1920s. Slater went to Europe on a Sheldon fellow-
ship from Harvard and spent the ﬁrst half of 1924 with Bohr and Kramers
in Copenhagen. During this period, Urey and Frank C. Hoyt (1898–1977)
were in Copenhagen as well, Urey on a small fellowship from the American-
Scandinavian Foundation, Hoyt on a more generous NRC fellowship paid for
by the Rockefeller foundation. 29 Among the visitors the Americans got to
meet in Bohr’s institute were Heisenberg and Pauli. Hoyt, a promising stu-
dent who never reached the level of distinction of the cohort immediately
following him, 30 was in Copenhagen for almost two years, from October 1922
to September 1924, Urey for less than one, from September 1923 to June 1924,
and Slater only for a few months, from December 1923 to April 1924. Slater
did not have a good experience in Copenhagen. This transpires, for instance,
in the letter he wrote to Van Vleck on his way back to the United States.
Oﬀ the coast of Nantucket, a few hours before his ship—The Cunard R.M.S.
“Lancastria”—docked in New York, he wrote:

Don’t remember just how much I told you about my stay in Copenhagen.
The paper with Bohr and Kramers [proposing the BKS theory] was got out
of the way the ﬁrst six weeks or so—written entirely by Bohr and Kramers.
That was very nearly the only paper that came from the institute at all the
time I was there; there seemed to be very little doing. Bohr does very little
and is chronically overworked by it . . . Bohr had to go on several vacations
in the spring, and came back worse from each one. 31

30 He wrote several papers on applications of Bohr’s correspondence principle (Hoyt,
1923, 1924, 1925a,b). The ﬁrst two are cited in (Van Vleck, 1924b, p. 334) and all
but the second are cited in (Van Vleck, 1926, pp. 124, 146). (Ladenburg and Reiche,
1924) cites the second paper, referring to the author as “W. C. Hoyt” (p. 672).
Hoyt also translated Bohr’s Nobel lecture into English (Bohr, 1923a). Hoyt ended
up making a career in weapons research rather than in academic physics. After the
war, he worked at Argonne National Laboratory, Los Alamos, and Lockheed. He
was interviewed for the AHQP by Heilbron but did not remember much of the early
days of quantum theory.

In October 1924, Dennison arrived in Copenhagen, on an International Edu-
cation Board (IEB) fellowship, another fellowship paid for by the Rockefeller
Foundation. 32 The state of quantum theory in America was already beginning
to change at that point. Like Hoyt, Dennison was awarded a NRC fellowship,
but was told that he could only spend the money at an American institution. 33

Van Vleck and Slater, who both started graduate school at Harvard in 1920
(Van Vleck in February, Slater in September) and lived in the same dor-
mitory, 34 had at one point discussed going to Copenhagen together upon
completion of their Ph.D. degrees in 1923. In the end, Van Vleck went to
Minneapolis instead. In the biographical note accompanying his Nobel lecture
from which we already quoted above, he reﬂected:

I was fortunate in being oﬀered an assistant professorship at the University
of Minnesota . . . with purely graduate courses to teach. This was an unusual
move by that institution, as at that time, posts with this type of teaching
were usually reserved for older men, and recent Ph.D.’s were traditionally
handicapped by heavy loads of undergraduate teaching which left little time
to think about research (Van Vleck, 1992, p. 351).

When the university hired Van Vleck it also hired Breit so that its new recruits
would not feel isolated. 35 Breit is one of the more eccentric ﬁgures of 20th-
century American physics. He was born in Russia and came to the United
States in 1915. In a biographical memoir of the National Academy of Sciences,
we read that

John Wheeler relates a story told to him by Lubov [Gregory’s sister] that
she and Gregory were vacationing on the sea when the call to leave Russia
came, and they ‘came as they were.’ For Gregory this meant dressed in a
sailor suit with short pants; he was still wearing it when he enrolled in Johns
Hopkins (at age sixteen!). Wheeler attributes some of Gregory’s subsequent
reticence to the ragging he took at the hand of his classmates for his dress

quoted by Dresden (1987, p. 165) in the course of his detailed discussion of Slater’s
reaction to his experiences in Copenhagen.
32 Bohr arranged for one of these fellowships to pay for Heisenberg’s visit to Copen-
hagen in the fall of 1924 (Cassidy, 1991, pp. 180, 183). See also the acknowledgment
in (Heisenberg, 1925b, p. 860).
33 See p. 12 of the transcript of session 1 of the AHQP interview with Dennison. In
1923, the NRC had likewise rejected the proposal of Robert S. Mulliken (1896–1987)
to go work with Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937) in Cambridge. Mulliken became a
NRC research fellow at Harvard instead (Assmus, 1992, p. 23).

(Hull, 1998, pp. 29–30).

In the run-up to the Manhattan Project, Breit served as “Coordinator of
Rapid Rupture.” He was obsessed with secrecy and resigned in May 1942.
He was replaced by J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904–1967) (Goodchild, 1980,
p. 48). True to form, Breit declined to be interviewed for the AHQP. In a
memorandum dated April 8, 1964 (included in the folder on Breit in the
AHQP), Kuhn describes how they met for lunch, but did not get beyond
“casual reminiscences.” Kuhn ends on a positively irritated note: “we broke
oﬀ amicably but with zero achievement to report for the project.”

Breit and Van Vleck replaced W. F. G. Swann (1884–1962) who had left Min-
neapolis for Chicago, taking his star graduate student Ernest O. Lawrence
(1901–1958) with him. As Van Vleck (1971) notes wryly: “A common unwit-
ting remark of the lady next to me at a dinner party was “Wasn’t it too bad
Minnesota lost Swann—it took two men to replace him!”” (p. 6).

Just as Minnesota hired both Breit and Van Vleck in 1923, the University
of Michigan hired not one but two students of Paul Ehrenfest (1880–1933)
in 1927, Uhlenbeck and Samuel A. Goudsmit (1902–1978) (Coben, 1971, p.
460). 36 In addition Michigan hired Dennison, its own alumnus, upon his return
from Copenhagen. Ann Arbor thus became an important center for quantum
theory, especially in molecular physics (Assmus, 1992, pp. 4, 26, 30). While
Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit essentially remained in Ann Arbor for the rest of
their careers, neither Breit nor Van Vleck stayed long in Minneapolis. Breit
left for the Carnegie Institution of Washington after only one year, Van Vleck
for the University of Wisconsin, his alma mater, after ﬁve. Van Vleck agonized
over the decision to leave Minnesota, where he had been promoted to associate
professor in June 1926 and, only a year later, to full professor (Fellows, 1985,
Ch. VII). Moreover, on June 10, 1927, he had married Abigail Pearson (1900–
1989), whom he had met while she was an undergraduate at the University of
Minnesota and who had strong ties to Minneapolis. 37

To replace Van Vleck, Minnesota made the irresistible oﬀer of a full profes-
sorship to the young Edward U. Condon (1902–1974). Minnesota had oﬀered
Condon an assistant professorship the year before. At that point, Condon had
received six such oﬀers and had decided on Princeton (Condon, 1973, p. 321).

36 See also (Sopka, 1988, p. 149) and the AHQP interview with Dennison. The
recruiting was done by Walter F. Colby (1880–1970) and Harrison M. Randall (1870–
1969).
37 After her husband’s death, Abigail made a generous donation to the University of
Minnesota to support the Abigail and John van Vleck Lecture Series. Phil Anderson
gave the inaugural lecture in 1983 and the series has brought several Nobel prize
winners to Minneapolis since. The main auditorium in the building currently housing
the University of Minnesota physics department is also named after the couple.

15

His laconic response to this embarrassment of riches: “The market conditions
for young theoretical physicists continues [sic] to surprise me” (Coben, 1971,
p. 463). Before his ﬁrst Minnesota winter as a full professor, Condon already
regretted leaving New Jersey. He returned to Princeton the following year.
Condon, Rabi, and Oppenheimer 38 were the leaders of the cohort of Ameri-
can quantum theorists graduating right after the quantum revolution of 1925.
The cohort most relevant to our story graduated right before that watershed.

2.3 The Physical Review

It was during Van Vleck’s tenure in Minnesota that his senior colleague John
T. (Jack) Tate (1889–1950) took over as editor-in-chief of The Physical Review
(Sopka, 1988, pp. 142–145, 203, note 11). Tate edited the journal from 1926
to 1950. 39 Van Vleck (1971) stressed the importance of Tate taking over the
journal, describing it as “another revolution” in the “middle of the quantum
revolution” (pp. 7–8). Van Vleck was highly appreciative of Tate’s role: “He
published my papers very promptly, and also often let me see manuscripts of
submitted papers, usually to referee” (ibid.). Thanks in no small measure to
Van Vleck and other young whippersnappers in quantum theory, Tate turned
what had been a lack-luster publication into the prestigious journal it still is
today. Van Vleck recalled the transformation:

The Physical Review was only so-so, especially in theory, and in 1922 I was
greatly pleased that my doctor’s thesis [Van Vleck, 1922] was accepted for
publication by the Philosophical Magazine in England . . . By 1930 or so, the
relative standings of The Physical Review and Philosophical Magazine were
interchanged . . . Prompt publication, beginning in 1929, of “Letters to the
Editor” in The Physical Review . . . obviated the necessity of sending notes
to Nature, a practice previously followed by our more eager colleagues [see,
e.g., (Breit, 1924b), (Slater, 1924, 1925c)] (Van Vleck, 1964, pp. 22, 24).

Van Vleck’s impression is corroborated by two foreign-born theorists who made
their careers in the United States, Rabi and Uhlenbeck (Coben, 1971, p. 456).
Rabi was born in Galicia but moved to New York City as an infant. Rabi
liked to tell the story of how, when he returned to Europe to study quantum
theory in Germany in 1927, he discovered that The Physical Review “was so
lowly regarded that the University of G¨ottingen waited until the end of the
year and ordered all twelve monthly issues at once to save postage” (ibid.).
On other occasions, Rabi told this story about Hamburg University (Rigden,

38 Oppenheimer enrolled as an undergraduate at Harvard in 1922, two years after
Van Vleck and Slater started graduate school there.
39 It is largely in recognition of this achievement that the current Minnesota physics
building is named after him.

16

1987, p. 4). He told Jeremy Bernstein (2004) that “in Hamburg so little was
thought of the journal . . . that the librarian uncrated the issues only once a
year” (p. 28). The following exchange between Kuhn and Heisenberg, talking
about the early twenties, is also revealing:

Heisenberg: “What was the American paper at that time?”
Kuhn: “The Physical Review?”
Heisenberg: “No, that didn’t exist at that time. I don’t think so. Well, in
these early times it probably didn’t play a very important role.” 40

In a talk about Condon, Rabi elaborated on the mediocrity of The Physical
Review:

it was not a very exciting journal even though I published my dissertation in
it. And we felt this very keenly. Here was the United States, a vast and rich
country but on a rather less than modest level in its contribution to physics,
at least per capita. And we resolved that we would change the situation.
And I think we did. By 1937 the Physical Review was a leading journal in
the world (Rabi, 1975, p. 7)

Uhlenbeck remembered how as a student in Leyden he viewed The Physical
Review as “one of the funny journals just like the Japanese.” 41 His initial
reaction to the job oﬀer from Michigan suggests that, at least at the time,
his disdain for American physics journals extended to the country as a whole:
“If it had been Egypt or somewhere like that, I would have gone right away,
or China, or even India, I always wanted to go to exotic places [Uhlenbeck
was born in Batavia in the Dutch East Indies, now Jakarta, Indonesia]; but
America seemed terribly dull and uninteresting”(Coben, 1971, p. 460). In the
AHQP interview with Uhlenbeck, one ﬁnds no such disparaging comments. In
fact, Uhlenbeck talks about how he had reluctantly agreed to return to the
Netherlands in 1935 to replace Kramers, who had left Utrecht for Leyden to
become Ehrenfest’s successor after the latter’s suicide. 42 Uhlenbeck was back
in Ann Arbor in 1939.

2.4 The lack of recognition of early American contributions to quantum the-

ory

Given the disadvantage they started out with, American theorists in the early
1920s would have done well had they just absorbed the work of their European
counterparts and transmitted it to the next generation. They did consider-

ably better than that. Even before the breakthrough of Heisenberg (1925c)
they started making important contributions themselves. According to Alexi
Assmus (1992), “[a]tomic physics was shark infested waters and was to be
avoided; U.S. physicists would ﬂourish and mature in the calmer and safer
tidepools of molecular physics” (p. 8; see also Assmus, 1999, p. 187). She sees
the early contributions of Van Vleck and Slater to atomic physics, which will
be the focus of our study, as exceptions to this rule:

Van Vleck and Slater viewed themselves as the younger generation, as cen-
tral ﬁgures in the “coming of age” of U.S. physics. They had been given
the knowledge that Kemble and his generation could provide and felt them-
selves capable of pushing into areas where the physics community in the
United States had not dared to venture. Still, after experiences had muted
their youthful exuberance, they turned to the by-then traditional problems
of American quantum physics[,] problems that addressed the building up of
matter rather than its deconstruction (Assmus, 1992, p. 22).

We hope to show that American work in atomic physics was signiﬁcantly more
important—if not in quantity, then at least in quality—than these remarks
suggest. 43 Slater was one of the architects of the short-lived but highly inﬂu-
ential Bohr-Kramers-Slater (BKS) theory (Bohr, Kramers, and Slater, 1924a)
(see sec. 4). Van Vleck’s two-part article in The Physical Review (Van Vleck,
1924b,c) is less well-known.

Originally, Van Vleck’s paper was to have three parts. A rough draft of the
third part has been preserved. 44 Van Vleck did not ﬁnish the third part at
the time. As he explained in a letter to Born on November 30, 1924 (AHQP):
“Part III which is not yet ready relates to classical black body radiation rather
than quantum theory.” It was only toward the end of his life that he returned
to the masterpiece of his youth. Three years before he died he published a
paper, co-authored with D. L. Huber, that can be seen as a substitute for part
III. As the authors explain:

Part III was to be concerned with the equilibrium between absorption and
emission under the Rayleigh-Jeans law. It was never written up for publi-
cation because in 1925 the author was busy writing his book [Van Vleck,
1926a] and of course the advent of quantum mechanics presented innumer-
able research problems more timely than a purely classical investigation.
The idea occurred to him to use the 50th anniversary of Parts I and II as

43 Assmus is probably right, however, that the Americans contributed more to molec-
ular than to atomic physics. This would ﬁt with the thesis of Schweber (1990) that
“Americans contributed most signiﬁcantly to the development of quantum mechan-
ics in quantum chemistry” (pp. 398–406)

Fellows for sharing a copy of this manuscript with us.

the date for publishing a paper which would start with Part III and might
even bear its title. Although he did not succeed in meeting the deadline, it
still provided a partial motivation for collaborating on the present article
(Van Vleck and Huber, 1977, p. 939).

It was at the suggestion of Jordan, that van der Waerden included the ﬁrst
(quantum) part of Van Vleck’s 1924 paper in his anthology on matrix me-
chanics (Van der Waerden, 1968, see the preface). 45 In his interview with
Van Vleck for the AHQP in October 1963, Kuhn claimed that Jordan had
told him that Born and Jordan “were working quite hard in an attempt to re-
formulate it [Van Vleck, 1924b,c] and had been multiplying Fourier coeﬃcients
together, 46 just at the time they got the Heisenberg paper that was going to
be matrix mechanics.” 47 In fact, a paper by Born and Jordan (1925a) build-
ing on (Van Vleck, 1924b,c) was submitted to Zeitschrift f¨ur Physik on June
11, 1925, several weeks before Heisenberg’s breakthrough (Cassidy, 1991, p.
198). We therefore suspect that Kuhn just misremembered or misconstrued
what Jordan had told him during an interview for the AHQP in June 1963,
a few months before the interview with Van Vleck. Van Vleck’s paper is dis-
cussed prominently in the interview with Jordan. It is ﬁrst brought up in the
second session (see p. 14 of the transcript). In this exchange Kuhn insisted that
(Born and Jordan, 1925a) had come out before (Van Vleck, 1924b,c). Jordan
corrected Kuhn at the beginning of the third session, which prompted some
further discussion of Van Vleck’s paper. However, it was Kuhn, not Jordan,
who suggested at that point that Born and Jordan continued to pursue the
ideas in Van Vleck’s paper even after publishing (Born and Jordan, 1925a).
Jordan did not conﬁrm this. Still, although Kuhn probably embellished he
story, there is no question that Van Vleck’s paper had a big impact on the
work of Born and Jordan. Jordan emphasized this in the interview with Kuhn,
in a letter to van der Waerden of December 1, 1961 (quoted in Van der Waer-
den, 1968, p. 17), and in (Jordan, 1973). We quote from this last source:

Van Vleck gave a derivation of Einstein’s laws of the relation between the
probabilities of spontaneous emission and positive and negative absorption.
This result of Einstein’s had been looked upon for a long time in a sceptical
manner by Niels Bohr; now it was highly interesting to see, just how from
Bohr’s preferred way of thinking, a derivation of Einstein’s law could be
given. Born and I performed a simpliﬁed mathematical derivation of the
results of Van Vleck. Our article on this topic [Born and Jordan, 1925a] did
not contain anything new apart from our simpler form of the calculation,
but by studying this topic we both came to a more intimate understanding

45 See also (Sopka, 1988, pp. 110–111).
46 The multiplication of quantum-theoretical quantities corresponding to classical
Fourier components is one of the key elements of Heisenberg’s Umdeutung paper.

of Bohr’s leading ideas (Jordan, 1973, p. 294, our emphasis). 48

Incidentally, Van Vleck (1971, p. 7) pointed to this important pre-1925 con-
tribution of his own as well as to Slater’s role in BKS and Kemble’s work on
helium to demonstrate the inaccuracy of Rabi’s characterization of American
work in quantum theory quoted earlier. Even at the time, Van Vleck had felt
that the Europeans were not giving the Americans their due. He complained
about this in a letter to Born:

I am writing this letter regarding some of the references to my work in your
articles. I fully realize that an occasional error in a reference is unavoid-
able, for I have made such mistakes myself. I would gladly overlook any
one error, but inasmuch as there are two or three instances, it is perhaps
worth while to call them to your attention. On p. 332 of your treatise on
“Atommechanik” [Born, 1925], the reference to my work on the crossed-
orbit model of the normal helium atom is given as [Van Vleck, 1923]. This
reference is only to the abstract of some work on excited helium and the
references to my articles on normal helium are [Van Vleck, 1922a] . . . and
especially [Van Vleck, 1922b], where the details of the computations are
given. This incorrect reference to a paper on another subject published a
year later makes it appear as though my computation was published si-
multaneously or later than that of Kramer[s] [(Kramers, 1923), cited in the
same footnote as (Van Vleck, 1923) in (Born, 1925, p. 332)]. The same error

in your book on Atommechanik [(Born, 1925, p. 332), the sentence with the

model has also been proposed by Bohr], without any mention of the name
Kemble, who proposed the crossed-orbit model in [Kemble, 1921] before

Van Vleck then comes to the most egregious case, Born’s failure to properly ac-
knowledge his two-part paper on the correspondence principle in (Born and Jordan,
1925a). Especially in view of Jordan’s comments on the importance of this
paper quoted above, the authors were very stingy in giving him credit. Van
Vleck’s letter continues:

the details of my computations were given in the Physical Review for Oct.

Journal of the Optical Society for July 1924 [Van Vleck, 1924a], before
Niessen’s article was even submitted for publication. I think you wrote me
inquiring about my work shortly after the appearance of this preliminary
note, and so you must be aware that it was the ﬁrst to appear . . . inasmuch
as Niessen’s discussion is somewhat less general than my own, it seems to
me that it scarcely merits being listed ﬁrst (Ibid.).

Writing from Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he was visiting MIT, Born
apologized. 50 Born had indeed written to Van Vleck concerning (Van Vleck,
1924a), albeit a little later than the latter remembered:

While we already came close to one another in the calculation of the helium
atom, I see from your paper “A Correspondence Principle for Absorption”
[Van Vleck, 1924a] that we now approach each other very closely with our
trains of thought . . . I am sending you my paper “On Quantum Mechanics”
[Born, 1924], which pursues a goal similar to yours. 51

This goes to show—Rabi’s anecdotal evidence to the contrary notwithstanding—
that at least some European physicists did keep up with theoretical work
published in American journals, the Journal of the Optical Society of Amer-
ica in this case, even if they were not particularly generous acknowledging its
importance in print.

3 Dispersion theory as the bridge between the old quantum theory

and matrix mechanics

From the point of view of modern quantum mechanics, the old quantum theory
of Bohr and Sommerfeld—especially in the hands of the latter and members
of his Munich school—was largely an elaborate attempt at damage control.
In classical physics the state of a physical system is represented by a point in
the phase space spanned by a system’s generalized coordinates and momenta
(qi, pi). All its properties are represented by functions f (qi, pi) deﬁned on this
phase space. In quantum mechanics the state of a system is represented by a
ray in the Hilbert space associated with the system; its properties are repre-
sented by operators acting in this Hilbert space, i.e., by rules for transitions

50 Born to Van Vleck, November 25, 1925 (AHQP). Born had been less generous in
the case of a similar complaint from America a few years earlier (see sec. 3 below).

from one ray to another. In the old quantum theory, one bent over backward to
retain classical phase space. Quantum conditions formulated in various ways in
(Sommerfeld, 1915a), (Wilson, 1915), (Ishiwara, 1915), (Schwarzschild, 1916),
and (Epstein, 1916) only restricted the allowed orbits of points in phase space.
These conditions restricted the value of so-called action integrals for every
degree of freedom of some multiply-periodic system to integer multiples of
Planck’s constant h,

pidqi = nih,

I

(1)

where the integral is extended over one period of the generalized coordinate
qi (there is no summation over i).

Imposing such quantum conditions on classical phase space would not do in
the end. As the picture of the interaction of matter and radiation in the
old quantum theory already suggests, more drastic steps were required. In
Bohr’s theory the frequency νi→f of the radiation emitted when an electron
makes the transition from an initial state i to a ﬁnal state f is given by the
energy diﬀerence Ei − Ef between the two states divided by h. Except in the
limiting case of high quantum numbers, this radiation frequency diﬀers sharply
from the frequencies with which the electron traverses its quantized orbits in
classical phase space before and after emission. This was widely recognized as
the most radical aspect of the Bohr model. Erwin Schr¨odinger (1887–1961),
for instance, opined in 1926 that this discrepancy between radiation frequency
and orbital frequency

. . . seems to me, (and has indeed seemed to me since 1914), to be something
so monstrous, that I should like to characterize the excitation of light in this
way as really almost inconceivable. 52

Imre Lakatos (1970) produces a lengthy quotation from an obituary of Planck
by Born (1948), in which the same point is made more forcefully. It even
repeats some of the language of Schr¨odinger’s letter:

That within the atom certain quantized orbits . . . should play a special role,
could well be granted; somewhat less easy to accept is the further assump-
tion that the electrons moving on these curvilinear orbits . . . radiate no
energy. But that the sharply deﬁned frequency of an emitted light quan-
tum should be diﬀerent from the frequency of the emitting electron would
be regarded by a theoretician who had grown up in the classical school as
monstrous and almost inconceivable (Lakatos, 1970, pp. 150–151, our em-
phasis).

Unfortunately, this passage is nowhere to be found in (Born, 1948)!

One area of the old quantum theory in which the “monstrous” element became
glaringly and unavoidably apparent was in the treatment of optical dispersion,
the diﬀerential refraction of light of diﬀerent colors. It was in this area that
physicists most keenly felt the tension between orbital frequencies associated
with individual states (the quantized electron orbits of the Bohr-Sommerfeld
model) and radiation frequencies associated with transitions between such
states. One of the key points of Heisenberg’s Umdeutung paper was to for-
mulate a new theory not in terms of properties of individual quantum states
but in terms of quantities associated with transitions between states without
even attempting to specify the states themselves. What, above all, prepared the
ground for this move, as we shall show in this section, was the development
of a quantum theory of dispersion by Ladenburg, Reiche, Bohr, Kramers, and
others. As Friedrich Hund (1896–1997) put it in his concise but rather cryptic
history of quantum theory:

In 1924 the question of the dispersion of light came to the foreground. It
brought new points of view, and it paved the way for quantum mechanics
(Hund, 1984, p. 128).

By comparison, many of the other preoccupations of the old quantum the-
ory, such as a detailed understanding of spectral lines, the Zeeman and Stark
eﬀects, and the extension of the Bohr-Sommerfeld model to multi-electron
atoms (in particular, helium) mostly added to the overall confusion and did
little to stimulate the shift to the new mode of thinking exempliﬁed by the
Umdeutung paper. 53

The same is true—pace Roger Stuewer (1975)—for the broad acceptance of
Einstein’s 1905 light-quantum hypothesis following the discovery of the Comp-
ton eﬀect in 1923. What was crucial for the development of matrix mechanics
were the A and B coeﬃcients for emission and absorption of the quantum the-
ory of radiation of (Einstein, 1916a,b, 1917), despite its use of light quanta.
Physicists working on dispersion theory were happy to use the A and B coeﬃ-
cients but they were just as happy to continue thinking of light as consisting of
waves rather than particles. John Hendry (1981) makes the provocative claim
that “since Sommerfeld was the only known convert to the light-quantum
concept as a result of the Compton eﬀect whose opinions were of any real
historical importance, this places Stuewer’s thesis on the importance of the
eﬀect in some doubt” (p. 197). It is our impression that the Compton eﬀect
did convince many physicists of the reality of light quanta, just as Stuewer
says it did, but we agree with Hendry (1981, p. 6) that this made surprisingly
little diﬀerence for the further development of quantum physics.

53 For detailed analyses of some of these bewildering developments, see, e.g., (Serwer,
1977; Forman, 1968, 1970).

3.1 The classical dispersion theory of Lorentz and Drude

Optical dispersion can boast of a venerable history in the annals of science
reaching back at least to Descartes’ rainbow and Newton’s prism. The old
quantum theory was certainly not the ﬁrst theory for which dispersion pre-
sented serious diﬃculties. Neither Newtonian particle theories of light of the
18th century nor the wave theory of the early-19th century provided con-
vincing accounts of the phenomenon (Cantor, 1983). In the wave theory of
Thomas Young (1773–1829) and Augustin Jean Fresnel (1788–1827), the in-
dex of refraction is related to the density of the luminiferous ether, the medium
thought to carry light waves, inside transparent matter. Dispersion, the de-
pendence of the index of refraction on frequency, thus forced proponents of
the theory to assume that the ether density inside transparent matter was
diﬀerent for diﬀerent colors! Similarly, one had to assume that matter con-
tained diﬀerent amounts of ether for the ordinary and the extraordinary ray
in double refraction. The problem likewise aﬀected the optics of moving bodies
(Janssen and Stachel, 2004; Stachel, 2005). To account for the absence of any
signs of motion of the earth with respect to the ether, Fresnel (1818) intro-
duced what is known as the “drag” coeﬃcient. He assumed that transparent
matter with index of refraction n carries along the ether inside of it with a
fraction f = 1 − 1/n2 of its velocity with respect to the ether. Although it was
widely recognized in the 19th century that the drag coeﬃcient was needed to
account for the null results of numerous ether drift experiments, many physi-
cists expressed strong reservations about the underlying physical mechanism
proposed by Fresnel, since it implied that, because of dispersion, matter had
to drag along a diﬀerent amount of ether for every frequency of light!

One of the great triumphs of Lorentz’s elaboration of the electromagnetic the-
ory of light in the early 1890s was that he could derive the drag coeﬃcient
without having to assume an actual ether drag (Lorentz, 1892). In Lorentz’s
theory, the ether is immobile, the ether density is the same everywhere, inside
or outside of matter, and the index of refraction is related, not to ether density,
but to the polarization of harmonically-bound charges, later to be identiﬁed
with electrons, inside transparent matter. The resonance frequencies of these
oscillating charges correspond to the material’s experimentally-known absorp-
tion lines. Lorentz’s dispersion theory was further developed by Paul Drude
(1863–1906) (see, e.g., Drude, 1900, Pt. II, Sec. II, Ch. V). This classical
Lorentz-Drude dispersion theory was remarkably successful in accounting for
the experimental data. In 1896, Lorentz was able to account for the Zeeman
eﬀect on the basis of this same picture of the interaction of matter and radi-
ation, which won him the 1902 Nobel prize (Kox, 1997). Two centuries after
Newton, there ﬁnally was a reasonably satisfactory theory of dispersion. Only
two decades later, however, the model of matter underlying this theory was
called into question again with the rise of the old quantum theory. The elec-

24

trons oscillating inside atoms in the Lorentz-Drude model were replaced by
electrons orbiting the nucleus in the Rutherford-Bohr model. As we shall see,
the Lorentz-Drude theory nonetheless played a key role in the development of
a quantum theory of dispersion in the early 1920s.

The basic model of dispersion in the Lorentz-Drude theory is very simple. 54
Suppose an electromagnetic wave of frequency ν (we are not concerned with
how and where this wave originated) strikes a charged one-dimensional simple
harmonic oscillator with characteristic frequency ν0. We focus on the case
of so-called normal dispersion, where the frequency ν of the electromagnetic
wave is far from the resonance frequency ν0 of the oscillator. The case where
ν is close to ν0 is called anomalous dispersion. We can picture the oscillator
as a point particle with mass m and charge −e (where e is the absolute value
of the electron charge) on a spring with equilibrium position x = 0 and spring
constant k, resulting in a restoring force F = −kx. The characteristic angular
frequency ω0 = 2πν0 is then given by
k/m. The electric ﬁeld E of the incident
electromagnetic wave 55 will induce an additional component of the motion
q
at the imposed frequency ν. This component will be superimposed on any
preexisting oscillations at the characteristic frequency ν0 of the unperturbed
system. It is this additional component of the particle motion, coherent with
the incident wave (i.e., oscillating with frequency ν), that is responsible for
the secondary radiation that gives rise to dispersion. The time-dependence of
this component is given by:

∆xcoh(t) = A cos ωt,

(2)

where ω = 2πν. To determine the amplitude A, we substitute eq. (2) into
the equation of motion for the system. As long as we are far from resonance,

54 Classical dispersion theory is covered elegantly in ch. 31 of Vol. 1 of the Feynman
lectures (see also ch. 32 of Vol. 2). Feynman makes it clear that this theory remains
relevant in modern physics: “we will assume that the atoms are little oscillators,
that is that the electrons are fastened elastically to the atoms . . . You may think
that this is a funny model of an atom if you have heard about electrons whirling
around in orbits. But that is just an oversimpliﬁed picture. The correct picture
of an atom, which is given by the theory of wave mechanics, says that, so far as
problems involving light are concerned, the electrons behave as though they were
held by springs” (Feynman et al., 1964, Vol. 1, sec. 31-4).
55 We need not worry about the eﬀects of the magnetic ﬁeld B. The velocity of
electrons in typical atoms is of order αc, where c is the velocity of light and α ≃ 1
137
is the ﬁne-structure constant. The eﬀects due to the magnetic ﬁeld are thus a factor
1
137 smaller than those due to the electric ﬁeld and can be ignored in all situations
considered in this paper.

radiation damping can be ignored and the equation of motion is simply: 56

m¨x = −mω2

0x − eE cos ωt,

where dots indicate time derivatives and where we have made the innocuous
simplifying assumption that the electric ﬁeld of the incident wave is in the
x-direction. Substituting ∆xcoh(t) in eq. (2) for x(t) in eq. (3), we ﬁnd:

− mω2A cos ωt = (−mω2

0A − eE) cos ωt.

It follows that

A =

eE
m(ω2 − ω2
0)

.

The central quantity in the Lorentz-Drude dispersion theory is the dipole
moment p(t) ≡ −e∆xcoh(t) of the oscillator induced by the electric ﬁeld of the
incident electromagnetic wave. From eqs. (2) and (5) it follows that:

p(t) = −e∆xcoh(t) =

e2E
4π2m(ν2

0 − ν2)

cos 2πνt.

For groups of ni oscillators of characteristic frequencies νi per unit volume,
this formula for the dipole moment naturally generalizes to the following result
for the polarization (i.e., the dipole moment per unit volume):

P (t) =

e2E
4π2m

The number of oscillators of characteristic frequency νi will be some fraction fi
of the numbers of atoms in the volume under consideration. This fraction was
often called the ‘oscillator strength’ in the literature of the time. The polar-
ization P determines the index of refraction n (see, e.g., Feynman et al., 1964,
Vol. 1, 31-5). The agreement of eq. (7) with the data from experiments on dis-
persion was not perfect, but dispersion was nonetheless seen as an important
success for Lorentz’s classical theory.

3.2 The Sommerfeld-Debye theory and its critics

An early and inﬂuential attempt to bring dispersion theory under the umbrella
of the old quantum theory was made by Sommerfeld (1915b, 1917) and by his
56 In sec. 5.3, we show how to take into account the eﬀects of radiation damping.

26

former student Peter Debye (1884–1966) (Debye, 1915). 57 Clinton J. Davisson
(1881–1958), then working at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pitts-
burgh, also contributed (Davisson, 1916). 58 The Debye-Sommerfeld theory,
as it came to be known, was based on the dubious assumption that the sec-
ondary radiation coming from small perturbations of a Bohr orbit induced by
incident radiation could be calculated on the basis of ordinary classical elec-
trodynamics, even though, by the basic tenets of the Bohr model, the classical
theory did not apply to the original unperturbed orbit. In other words, it
was assumed that, while the large accelerations of electrons moving on Bohr
orbits would produce no radiation whatsoever, the comparatively small ac-
celerations involved in the slight deviations from these orbits caused by weak
incident radiation would produce radiation. 59 Otherwise, the theory stayed
close to the Lorentz-Drude theory, substituting small deviations in the motion
of electrons from their Bohr orbits for small deviations from the vibrations of
simple harmonic oscillators at their characteristic frequencies.

Both the Swedish physicist Carl Wilhelm Oseen (1879–1944) and Bohr severely
criticized the way in which Debye and Sommerfeld modeled their quantum dis-
persion theory on the classical theory. Oseen (1915) wrote: “Bohr’s atom model
can in no way be reconciled with the fundamental assumptions of Lorentz’s
electron theory. We have to make our choice between these two theories” (p.

57 For other historical discussions of the development of quantum dispersion
theory, see, e.g., (Darrigol, 1992, pp. 224–230), (Dresden, 1987, pp. 146–159,
pp. 215–222), (Jammer, 1966, p. 165 and sec. 4.3, especially pp. 188–195),
(Mehra and Rechenberg, 1982–2001, Vol. 1, sec. VI.1; Vol. 2, sec. III.5, pp. 170–
190; Vol. 6, sec. III.1 (b), pp. 348–353), and (Whittaker, 1953, Vol. 1, p. 401; Vol.
2, pp. 200–206). Van Vleck (1926, sec. 49, pp. 156–159) brieﬂy discusses the early
attempts to formulate a quantum theory of dispersion in his review article on the
old quantum theory. We focus on the theory of Debye and Sommerfeld. Van Vleck
also mentions theories by Charles Galton Darwin (1887–1962), Adolf Gustav Smekal
(1895–1959), and Karl F. Herzfeld (1892–1978). All three of these theories make use
of light quanta. In addition, strict energy conservation is given up in the theory of
Darwin (1922, 1923), while in the theories of Smekal (1923) and Herzfeld (1924)
orbits other than those picked out by the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition are allowed, a
feature known as “diﬀuse quantization.” For other (near) contemporary reviews of
dispersion theory, see (Pauli, 1926, pp. 86–96), (Andrade, 1927, pp. 669–682), and
(Breit, 1932). Stolzenburg (1984, pp. 17–18) brieﬂy discusses Bohr’s critical reaction
to Darwin’s dispersion theory.
58 In 1927 at Bell Labs, Davisson and his assistant Lester H. Germer (1896–1971)
would do their celebrated work on electron diﬀraction (Davisson and Germer, 1927),
another great American contribution to (experimental) quantum physics for which
the authors received the 1937 Nobel prize (Kevles, 1978, pp. 188–189).
59 Sommerfeld (1915b, p. 502) realized that this assumption was problematic and
tried (unconvincingly) to justify it.

27

405). 60 Bohr agreed. The central problem was that in Bohr’s theory the link
between radiation frequencies and orbital frequencies had been severed. As
Bohr explained to Oseen in a letter of December 20, 1915, if the characteristic
frequencies involved in dispersion

. . . are determined by the laws for quantum emission, the dispersion cannot,
whatever its explanation, be calculated from the motion of the electrons and
the usual electrodynamics, which does not have the slightest connection with
the frequencies considered (Bohr, 1972–1996, Vol. 2, p. 337).

Bohr elaborated on his criticism of the Debye-Sommerfeld theory in a lengthy
paper intended for publication in Philosophical Magazine in 1916 but with-
drawn after it was already typeset. 61 Bohr argued (we leave out the speciﬁcs
of the experiments on dispersion in various gases that Bohr mentions in this
passage):

[E]xperiments . . . show that the dispersion . . . can be represented with a
high degree of approximation by a simple Sellmeier formula 62 in which the
characteristic frequencies coincide with the frequencies of the lines in the
. . . spectra . . . [T]hese frequencies correspond with transitions between the
normal states of the atom . . . On this view we must consequently assume
that the dispersion . . . depends on the same mechanism as the transition
between diﬀerent stationary states, and that it cannot be calculated by
application of ordinary electrodynamics from the conﬁguration and motions
of the electrons in these states (Bohr, 1972–1996, Vol. 2, pp. 448–449).

In the next paragraph, Bohr added a prescient comment. Inverting the line
of reasoning in the pasage above that dispersion should depend on the same
mechanism as transitions between states, he suggested that transitions be-
tween states, about which the Bohr theory famously says nothing, should
depend on the same mechanism as dispersion: “[i]f the above view is correct
. . . we must, on the other hand, assume that this mechanism [of transitions
between states] shows a close analogy to an ordinary electrodynamic vibrator”
(ibid.).

As we shall see, in the quantum dispersion theory of the 1920s, the Lorentz-
Drude oscillators were grafted onto the Bohr model. For the time being, how-
ever, it was unclear how to arrive at a satisfactory quantum theory of disper-
sion. The quasi-classical Debye-Sommerfeld theory led to a formula for the
induced polarization of the form of eq. (7) but with resonance poles at the

61 It can be found in (Bohr, 1972–1996, Vol. 2, pp. 433–461). For further discussion
of Bohr’s early views on dispersion, see (Heilbron and Kuhn, 1969, pp. 281–283).
62 This is a formula of the form of eq. (7) derived on the basis of an elastic-solid
theory of the ether in (Sellmeier, 1872) (Jammer, 1966, p. 189).

orbital frequencies. As Oseen and Bohr pointed out, this was in blatant con-
tradiction with the experimental data, which clearly indicated that the poles
should be at the radiation frequencies, which in Bohr’s theory diﬀered sharply
from the orbital frequencies.

This criticism is repeated in more sophisticated form in a paper by Paul So-
phus Epstein (1883–1966) with the subtitle “Critical comments on disper-
sion.” This paper is the concluding installment of a trilogy on the applica-
tion of classical perturbation theory to problems in the old quantum theory
(Epstein, 1922a,b,c). Epstein, a Russian Jew who studied with Sommerfeld
in Munich, was the ﬁrst European quantum theorist to be lured to Amer-
ica. In 1921 Millikan brought him to the California Institute of Technology
in Pasadena, despite prevailing antisemitic attitudes (Kevles, 1978, pp. 211–
212). 63 In his 1926 review article Van Vleck emphasizes the importance of
the work of his colleague at Caltech and notes that it “is rather too often
overlooked” (Van Vleck, 1926, p. 164, note 268), to which one might add: “by
European physicists.” As we saw in sec. 2.4, Van Vleck felt the same way
about his own contributions. Like Van Vleck, Epstein apparently complained
about this lack of recognition to Born. This can be inferred from a letter from
Born to Sommerfeld of January 5, 1923, shortly before a visit of the latter to
the United States:

When you talk to Epstein in Pasadena and he complains about me, tell
him that he should show you the very unfriendly letter he wrote to me
because he felt that his right as ﬁrst-born had been compromised by the
paper on perturbation theory by Pauli and me [Born and Pauli, 1922, which
appeared shortly after Epstein’s trilogy]. Also tell him that I do not answer
such letters but that I do not hold a grudge against him because of his
impoliteness (to put it mildly) . . . In terms of perturbative quantization we
are ahead of him anyway (Sommerfeld, 2004, p. 137). 64

To deal with the kind of multiply-periodic systems that represent hydrogenic
atoms (i.e., atoms with only one valence electron) in the old quantum theory,
Epstein customized techniques developed in celestial mechanics for computing
the perturbations of the orbits of the inner planets due to the gravitational
pull of the outer ones. 65 The perihelion advance of Mercury due to such
perturbations, for instance, is more than ten times the well-known 43′′ per

63 For further discussion of Epstein’s position at Caltech, see (Seidel, 1978, pp. 507–
520).
64 This letter is quoted and discussed in (Eckert, 1993, p. 96)
65 One of the sources cited by Epstein (1922a, p. 216) is (Charlier, 1902–1907).
This source is also cited in (Bohr, 1918, p. 114), (Kramers, 1919, p. 8), and
(Born and Pauli, 1922, p. 154). In their interviews for the AHQP, both Van Vleck
(p. 14 of the transcript of session 1) and Heisenberg (p. 24 of the transcript of
session 5) mention that they studied Charlier as well.

century due to the gravitational ﬁeld of the sun as given by general relativity.
Such calculations in classical mechanics are also the starting point of the later
more successful approach to dispersion theory by Kramers and Van Vleck.
Epstein clearly recognized that these calculations by themselves do not lead
to a satisfactory theory of dispersion. In the introduction of his paper, Epstein
(1922c, p. 92) explains that he discusses dispersion mainly because it nicely
illustrates some of the techniques developed in the ﬁrst two parts of his trilogy.
He warns the reader that he is essentially following the Debye-Sommerfeld
theory, and emphasizes that “this point of view leads to internal contradictions
so strong that I consider the Debye-Davysson [sic] dispersion theory [as Epstein
in Pasadena referred to it] to be untenable” (ibid.). The central problem is once
again the discrepancy between radiation frequencies and orbital frequencies.
As Epstein wrote in the conclusion of his paper:

the positions of maximal dispersion and absorption [in the formula he de-
rived] do not lie at the position of the emission lines of hydrogen but at the
position of the mechanical frequencies of the model . . . the conclusion seems
unavoidable to us that the foundations of the Debye-Davysson [sic] theory
are incorrect (Epstein, 1922c, pp. 107–108).

Epstein recognized that a fundamentally new approach was required: “We
believe that . . . dispersion theory must be put on a whole new basis, in which
one takes the Bohr frequency condition into account from the very beginning”
(ibid., p. 110).

3.3 Dispersion in Breslau: Ladenburg and Reiche

Unbeknownst to Epstein, quantum dispersion theory had already begun to
emerge from the impasse he called attention to in 1922. The year before,
Ladenburg had introduced one of two key ingredients needed for a satisfac-
tory treatment of dispersion in the old quantum theory: the emission and
absorption coeﬃcients of Einstein’s quantum theory of radiation. The other
critical ingredient, as we shall see below, was Bohr’s correspondence principle.

Ladenburg spent most of his career doing experiments on dispersion in gases,
beginning in 1908, about two years after he joined the physics department,
then headed by Otto Lummer (1860–1925), at the University of Breslau, his
hometown (Ladenburg, 1908). 66 He stayed in Breslau until 1924, when he ac-
cepted a position at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institut in Berlin. There he continued
his work with the help of students such as Hans Kopfermann (1895–1963),
Agathe Carst, S. Levy, and G. Wolfsohn. Ladenburg and his group reported

the results of their experiments on dispersion in a series of papers published
between 1926 and 1934. 67 Ladenburg’s direct involvement ceased with his
emigration to the United States in 1931.

Ladenburg and Stanislaw Loria (1883–1958) had established early on that the
frequency of the Hα line in the Balmer series in the hydrogen spectrum corre-
sponds to a pole in the Lorentz-Drude dispersion formula (Ladenburg and Loria,
1908, p. 866). Given that the Sommerfeld-Debye theory ﬂies in the face of this
experimental fact, Ladenburg was never attracted to that theory. He simply
kept using a dispersion formula with poles at the observed radiation frequen-
cies. He focused on the numerator rather than the denominator of the dis-
persion formula. This is made particularly clear in the AHQP interviews with
two of his collaborators in the early 1920s—Rudolph Minkowski (1895–1976),
a nephew of Hermann Minkowski, who took his doctorate under Ladenburg
in 1921 and co-authored (Ladenburg and Minkowski, 1921); and Fritz Reiche,
who came to Breslau to replace Schr¨odinger in 1921. 68 After his doctorate
(with Planck) in Berlin in 1907, Reiche had already spent three years in Bres-
lau and had become close friends with Ladenburg during that period. He had
gone back to Berlin in 1911. When he returned to Breslau ten years later,
he stayed until he was dismissed in 1933. 69 Reiche’s help is prominently ac-
knowledged in (Ladenburg, 1921, p. 140, note). Ladenburg was ﬁrst and fore-
most an experimentalist and he welcomed input from his theoretician friend
and colleague. 70 The two of them co-authored a pair of follow-up papers
(Ladenburg and Reiche, 1923, 1924). Discussing the ﬁrst of these, Reiche told
Kuhn and Uhlenbeck in 1962:

we did not derive a consistent dispersion theory, in which instead of the
revolution numbers the emitted lines came out. We thought it completely
self-evident, that one had to change the denominator of the dispersion for-
mula in such a way that the frequencies were the emitted line frequencies,
and not something which has to do with (the orbit) [sic]. 71

“But that was a big step,” Uhlenbeck interjected, “wasn’t it?” “But not in
this direction,” Reiche insisted,

68 The following information is based on an autobiographical statement by Reiche
published as an appendix to (Bederson, 2005).
69 It was not until 1941 that he ﬁnally managed to emigrate to the United States.
70 Asked by Kuhn whether Ladenburg was “strictly an experimentalist,” Reiche
said: “He was, as far as I understand, a very good experimental man, but he was
one of the men who could make, let me say, easy theoretical work” (p. 10 of the
transcript of the last of three sessions of the interview).

Only in the direction of explaining that the N which is on top of the dis-
persion formula—the number of [dispersion] electrons [sic]. It never came
out correctly equal to the number of atoms, or to the number of atoms
multiplied by the number of electrons in an atom. It gave, under certain
conditions, even numbers which are less than the whole number of atoms.
They were written very often with a German N . . . This was the main aim
of the whole thing [Ladenburg and Reiche, 1923]. There, based on a previ-
ous paper by Ladenburg [1921], we found a relation between the German
N and the real number of atoms. The f were not 1 or 2 or 3 or something
like this, but could be point 5 or the like. And the explanation of this was
the aim of this dispersion paper. But it did not come out that we had a
correct and consistent theory in which the denominator gave now the emit-
ted frequencies. This, I think, was only done by Kramers [1924a, b], ﬁrst of
all. 72

Ladenburg’s dispersion experiments had indicated all along that the oscillator
strength fi, the number of dispersion electrons with characteristic frequency
νi per number of atoms, was not on the order of unity, as one would expect on
the basis of the Lorentz-Drude theory, but much smaller. For the frequency νi
corresponding to the Hα line in the Balmer series in the hydrogen spectrum,
for instance, Ladenburg and Loria (1908, p. 865) found that there was only 1
dispersion electron per 50,000 molecules, and they cited ﬁndings of 1 disper-
sion electron per 200 molecules in sodium vapor. Such low values were quite
inexplicable on classical grounds. In the Bohr model the Hα (absorption) line
corresponds to a transition from the n = 2 to the n = 3 state of the hydro-
gen atom. That Ladenburg found such a low value for what he interpreted
classically as the number of dispersion electrons at the frequency of the Hα
line is explained in Bohr’s theory simply by noting that only a tiny fraction of
the atoms will be in the n = 2 state (Ladenburg, 1921, p. 156). Ladenburg’s
key contribution was that he recognized that the oscillator strengths corre-
sponding to various transitions could all be interpreted in terms of transition
probabilities, given by Einstein’s A and B coeﬃcients. Hence the title of his
paper: “The quantum-theoretical interpretation of the number of dispersion
electrons” (Ladenburg, 1921).

Ladenburg obtained a relation between the oscillator strengths and the A
and B coeﬃcients by equating results derived for what would seem to be two
mutually exclusive models of matter, a classical and a quantum model. He
calculated the rate of absorption of energy both for a collection of classical os-
cillators `a la Lorentz and Drude, resonating at the absorption frequencies, and
for a collection of atoms `a la Bohr and Einstein with transitions between dis-

crete energy levels corresponding to these same frequencies. Ladenburg set the
two absorption rates equal to one another. His paper only gives the resulting
expression for the numerator of the dispersion formula. Combining Laden-
burg’s theoretical relation between classical oscillator strengths and quantum
transition probablities with his experimental evidence that the resonance poles
should be at the radiation frequencies, we arrive at the following formula—in
our notation, based on (Van Vleck, 1924b)—for the induced polarization of a
group of Nr atomic systems in their ground state r

where νs→r is the frequency for a transition from the excited states s to r and
As→r is Einstein’s emission coeﬃcient for this transition.

Ladenburg’s paper initially did not attract much attention. It is not mentioned
in Epstein’s trilogy the following year, but then Epstein was working in far-
away California. More surprisingly, quantum physicists in G¨ottingen, Munich,
and Copenhagen, it seems, also failed to take notice, even though Laden-
burg was well-known to his G¨ottingen colleagues Born and James Franck
(1882–1964). Ladenburg had actually prevented that Born, a fellow Breslau
native, was sent to the trenches in World War I. Ladenburg had recruited Born
for an army unit under his command in Berlin devoted to artillery research
(Thorndike Greenspan, 2005, pp. 71–72). Bohr and Ladenburg also knew each
other personally: Ladenburg had attended Bohr’s colloquium in Berlin in April
1920 and the two men had exchanged a few letters since (Bohr, 1972–1996,
Vol. 4, pp. 709–717).

Heisenberg later attributed the neglect of Ladenburg in G¨ottingen and Mu-
nich to the problem of connecting Ladenburg’s work, closely tied to Einstein’s
radiation theory, to the dominant Bohr-Sommerfeld theory. 73 According to
Heisenberg, it was only when Kramers (1924a,b) rederived Ladenburg’s for-
mula as a special case of his own more general dispersion formula that its
signiﬁcance was widely appreciated. 74 Ladenburg’s own derivation had been

73 See p. 8 of the transcript of session 4 of the AHQP interview with Heisenberg,
parts of which can be found in (Mehra and Rechenberg, 1982–2001, Vol. 2, pp.
175–176), although the authors cite their own conversations with Heisenberg as
their source.
74 Jordan had the same impression (see pp. 24–25 of the transcript of the ﬁrst session
of Kuhn’s interview with Jordan for the AHQP in June 1963). It also ﬁts with
Born’s recollections. In his autobiography, Born (1978) notes: “An important step
was made by my old friend from Breslau . . . Ladenburg . . . A detailed account was
given by Ladenburg and Reiche, my other old friend from Breslau . . . On the basis
of these investigations, Kramers . . . succeeded in developing a complete ‘dispersion

33

unconvincing, at least to most physicists. 75 In addition to just assuming the
poles in the dispersion formula to be at the radiation frequencies rather than at
the orbital frequencies, Ladenburg oﬀered no justiﬁcation for equating the rate
of energy absorption in his classical model to that for his Einsteinian quan-
tum model of matter. Van der Waerden (1968, p. 10) suggests that Ladenburg
appealed to Bohr’s correspondence principle in his derivation of the relation
between oscillator strengths and A and B coeﬃcients, but the correspondence
principle is not mentioned anywhere in Ladenburg’s paper. The full dispersion
formula (8)—admittedly only implicit in Ladenburg’s paper but associated
with it, not just by later historians but also by his contemporaries—can cer-
tainly not be derived with the help of the correspondence principle, since it
only holds for atoms in their ground state and not for atoms in highly excited
states where classical and quantum theory may be expected to merge in the
sense of the correspondence principle. Still, if Heisenberg’s later recollections
are to be trusted, it might have helped the reception of Ladenburg’s paper
had he made some reference to the correspondence principle.

Unlike his colleagues in G¨ottingen and Munich, Bohr in fact took notice
of Ladenburg’s paper early on. He was just slow, as usual, to express him-
self about it in print. As noted in (Hendry, 1981, p. 192), Bohr referred to
(Ladenburg, 1921) in the very last sentence of a manuscript he did not date
but probably started and abandoned in 1921 (Bohr, 1972–1996, Vol. 3, pp.
397–414). In a paper submitted in November 1922, Bohr (1923b, p. 162) ﬁnally
discussed Ladenburg’s work in print. After repeating some of the observations
about dispersion made in the passages of his unpublished 1916 paper quoted
in sec. 3.2, Bohr, in his tortuous verbose style, made some highly interesting
remarks that anticipate aspects of the BKS theory of 1924 (see sec. 4):

the phenomena of dispersion must thus be so conceived that the reaction
of the atom on being subjected to radiation is closely connected with the
unknown mechanism which is answerable [the German has verantwortlich:
responsible] for the emission of the radiation on the transition between sta-
tionary states. In order to take account of the observations, it must be
assumed that this mechanism . . . becomes active when the atom is illumi-
nated in such a way that the total reaction of a number of atoms is the same
as that of a number of harmonic oscillators in the classical theory, 76 the

formula’” (pp. 215–216).
75 As Kuhn put it in his AHQP interview with Slater: “Of course, there was a
good deal that appeared to most physicists as pretty totally ad hoc about the
Reiche-Ladenburg work, and the whole question as to why it was the transition
frequencies that occurred in the denominator rather than the orbital frequencies.”
Slater disagreed: “This seemed to me perfectly obvious . . . ” (p. 41 of the transcript
of the ﬁrst session of the interview).
76 Note the similarity between Bohr’s description here to Feynman’s observation
(quoted in note 54 above) that atoms behave like oscillators “so far as problems

34

frequencies of which are equal to those of the radiation emitted by the atom
in the possible processes of transition, and the relative number of which is
determined by the probability of occurrence of such processes of transition
under the inﬂuence of illumination. A train of thought of this kind was ﬁrst
followed out closely in a work by Ladenburg [1921] in which he has tried,
in a very interesting and promising manner, to set up a direct connection
between the quantities which are important for a quantitative description of
the phenomena of dispersion according to the classical theory and the coef-
ﬁcients of probability appearing in the deduction of the law of temperature
radiation by Einstein (Bohr, 1972–1996, Vol. 3, p. 496).

A letter from Bohr to Ladenburg of May 17, 1923 oﬀers further insights into
Bohr’s developing views on the mechanism of radiation:

to interpret the actual observations, it . . . seems necessary to me that the
quantum jumps are not the direct cause of the absorption of radiation, but
that they represent an eﬀect which accompanies the continuously dispersing
(and absorbing) eﬀect of the atom on the radiation, even though we cannot
account in detail for the quantitative relation [between these two eﬀects]
with the usual concepts of physics (Bohr, 1972–1996, Vol. 5, p. 400).

At the beginning of this letter, Bohr mentioned the vagueness of some of
his earlier pronouncements on the topic. After the passage just quoted he
acknowledged “that these comments are not far behind the earlier ones in
terms of vagueness. I do of course reckon with the possibility that I am on the
wrong track but, if my view contains even a kernel of truth, then it lies in the
nature of the matter that the demand for clarity in the current state of the
theory is not easily met” (ibid.). Bohr need not have been so apologetic. His
comments proved to be an inspiration to Ladenburg and Reiche. On June 14,
1923, Ladenburg wrote to Bohr:

Over the last few months Reiche and I have often discussed [the absorption
and scattering of radiation] following up on your comments in [Bohr 1923b]
about reﬂection and dispersion phenomena and on my own considerations
[Ladenburg 1921] which you were kind enough to mention there (Bohr,
1972–1996, Vol. 5, pp. 400–401).

In this same letter, Ladenburg announced his forthcoming paper with Reiche
in a special issue of Die Naturwissenschaften to mark the tenth anniversary
of Bohr’s atomic theory. In the conclusion of this paper, they wrote: 77

Surveying the whole area of scattering and dispersion discussed here, we
have to admit that we do not know the real [eigentlich] mechanism through

involving light are concerned.”
77 Quoted and discussed in (Hendry, 1981, p. 192).

which an incident wave acts on the atoms and that we cannot describe
the reaction of the atom in detail. This is no diﬀerent by the way in the
case of the real [eigentlich] quantum process, be it that an external wave
ν0 lifts electrons into higher quantum states, or be it that a wave ν0 is
sent out upon the return to lower states. We nevertheless believe on the
grounds of the observed phenomena that the end result of a process in
which a wave of frequency ν acts upon the atom should not be seen as
fundamentally diﬀerent from the eﬀect that such a wave exerts on classical
oscillators (Ladenburg and Reiche, 1923, p. 597).

Ladenburg and Reiche (1923, p. 588, p. 590) introduced the term “substitute
oscillators” [Ersatzoszillatoren] for such classical oscillators representing the
atom as far as its interaction with radiation is concerned. They credited Bohr
with the basic idea. 78 As we shall see in sec. 4, these substitute oscillators
became the virtual oscillators of BKS. Ladenburg and Reiche (1924, p. 672)
themselves noted the following year that substitute oscillators were now called
virtual oscillators (Konno, 1993, p. 141). The Berlin physicist Richard Becker
(1887–1955) likewise noted in a paper written in the context of BKS the follow-
ing year: “these virtual oscillators are substantially identical with the ‘substi-
tute oscillators’ already introduced by Ladenburg and Reiche” (Becker, 1924,
p. 174, note 2). 79 That same year, Herzfeld (1924, p. 350) still used the term
‘substitute oscillators,’ citing (Ladenburg and Reiche, 1923). The term can
also be found, without attribution, in the famous paper by Born and Jordan
(1925b, p. 884) on matrix mechanics. 80

Unlike Ladenburg in 1921, Ladenburg and Reiche prominently mentioned both
Bohr’s atomic theory and the correspondence principle in their 1923 paper.
The authors’ understanding and use of the correspondence principle, however,
are still tied strongly to Einstein’s quantum theory of radiation. Their “cor-
respondence” arguments apply not to individual quantum systems, for which
Bohr’s correspondence principle was formulated, but to collections of such sys-
tems in thermal equilibrium with the ambient radiation. 81 The authors also

78 See also (Ladenburg and Reiche, 1924, p. 672). Van Vleck (1926, p. 159, note 260)
reports that Lorentz made a similar suggestion at the third Solvay congress in 1921
(Verschaﬀelt et al., 1923, p. 24), but does not mention Ladenburg and Reiche in
this context, attributing the idea to (Slater, 1924) instead.
79 Quoted in (Konno, 1993, p. 141).
80 We are grateful to J¨urgen Ehlers for drawing our attention to this passage, which
is not in the part of (Born and Jordan, 1925b) included in (Van der Waerden, 1968).
81 That Ladenburg and Reiche did not carefully distinguish between individual sys-
tems and collections of such systems becomes more understandable if we bear in
mind that they were trying to combine Einstein’s quantum theory of radiation
and Bohr’s correspondence principle. These two elements belong to two diﬀerent
strands in the development of quantum physics, characterized as follows in a con-
cise and perceptive overview of the early history of quantum physics: “The ﬁrst

do not limit their “correspondence” arguments to the regime of high quan-
tum numbers (Ladenburg and Reiche, 1923, especially secs. 4–5, pp. 586–589).
These problems invalidate many of the results purportedly derived from the
correspondence principle in their paper. Drawing on earlier work by Planck,
they derived a result for emission consistent with the correspondence principle
(i.e., merging with the classical result in the limit of high quantum numbers),
but their attempts to derive similar results for absorption and dispersion were
unconvincing. In fact, it may well be that these dubious attempts inspired
Van Vleck to formulate correspondence principles for emission and absorption
himself (see sec. 5.3 for further discussion).

3.4 The Kramers dispersion formula

Given Bohr’s strong interest in the subject, it is not surprising that his ﬁrst
lieutenant Kramers took the next big step in quantum dispersion theory. 82
Formula (8) based on Ladenburg’s insights only holds for systems in the ground
state. The correspondence principle only applies to highly excited states.
Kramers (1924a,b) found that the correspondence principle requires a for-
mula with two terms. 83 In our notation—which once again follows (Van Vleck,
1924b, p. 344, eq. 17)—the induced polarization Pr of Nr atoms in a state la-
beled by the quantum number r is given by

Pr(t) =

where s and t are the quantum numbers labeling states above and below r,
respectively (see secs. 5.1–5.2 and 6.2 for detailed derivations). For high values
of r this formula merges with the classical result. In the spirit of the corre-
spondence principle, Kramers took the leap of faith that it holds all the way
down to low quantum numbers. If r is the ground state, the second term van-
ishes and the Kramers formula (9) reduces to the Ladenburg formula (8). Like
Ladenburg and Reiche (1923), Kramers interpreted his formula in terms of
oscillators, distinguishing between “absorption oscillators” for the ﬁrst term

approach, dominated by the Berlin physicists Einstein, Planck, and Nernst, and
by . . . Ehrenfest . . . involved the thermodynamics properties of matter and the na-
ture of radiation . . . The other trend, centered socially in Copenhagen, Munich and
G¨ottingen, consisted of the application of the quantum to individual atoms and
molecules” (Darrigol, 2002, p. 336).
82 Hendry (1984, p. 46) goes as far as calling Kramers’ theory “the Bohr-Kramers
dispersion theory.”
83 In addition to the literature cited in note 57, see (Ter Haar, 1998, pp. 23–30) and,
especially, (Konno, 1993) for discussion of Kramers’ work on dispersion theory.

37

i→f . So instead of factors ν2

and “emission oscillators” for the second term (Kramers, 1924a, pp. 179–180).
Kramers introduced the characteristic times τi→f inversely proportional to
(e2/m)ν2
i→f in the denominators in the two terms
in eq. (9), the formula given by Kramers (1924a, p. 179, eq. 5) has factors
(e2/m)τi→f in the numerators. 84 Because of the minus sign in front of the
second term, the emission oscillators appear to have negative mass, which is
why Kramers also called them “negative oscillators” (ibid.). Van Vleck (1924a,
p. 30, note 2) gave a more satisfactory interpretation of this minus sign, in-
terpreting Kramers’ formula for dispersion the same way he interpreted the
formula he himself had found for absorption, as giving the net dispersion in a
given quantum state as the diﬀerence between contributions from transitions
to higher and transitions to lower states.

Kramers initially only published two notes in Nature on his new dispersion for-
mula (Kramers, 1924a,b). Since these were submitted after (Bohr, Kramers, and Slater,
1924a), he used the new BKS terminology of ‘virtual oscillators’ in both of
them. As we shall see in sec. 4, this caused considerable confusion, both at
the time and in the historical literature, about the relation between BKS and
dispersion theory. Kramers’ notes, moreover, are short on detail. The ﬁrst,
submitted on March 25, contains only the briefest of hints as to how the new
dispersion formula had been found. The second, submitted on July 22 in re-
sponse to a letter by Minnesota’s Gregory Breit (1924b), contains at least
an outline of the derivation. Kramers did not get around to publishing the
derivation in full until his paper with Heisenberg, completed over the Christ-
mas break of 1924, received by Zeitschrift f¨ur Physik on January 5, 1925,
and published two months later (Mehra and Rechenberg, 1982–2001, Vol. 2,
p. 181). According to Slater, however, the basic results had been in place by
the time he, Slater, arrived in Copenhagen in December 1923. After dissing
Bohr in the letter to Van Vleck quoted in sec. 2.2, Slater goes on to say that

Kramers hasn’t got much done, either. You perhaps noticed his letter to
Nature on dispersion [Kramers, 1924a]; the formulas & that he had before
I came, although he didn’t see the exact application; and except for that
he hasn’t done anything, so far as I know. They seem to have too much
administrative work to do. Even at that, I don’t see what they do all the
time. Bohr hasn’t been teaching at all, Kramers has been giving one or two
courses. 85

84 The polarization given by Kramers’ formula is three times the polarization given
by Van Vleck (i.e., by our eq (9)). This is because Kramers assumed that the vibra-
tions in the atom are lined up with the electric ﬁeld, whereas Van Vleck assumed
the relative orientation of vibrations and ﬁelds to be random (Van Vleck, 1924b, p.
344, note 25).

38

Part of what kept Kramers from his work in early 1924, as can be gath-
ered from correspondence with Ladenburg and Reiche, was that his wife had
fallen ill. In 1923, the Breslau physicists had already exchanged a few letters
about dispersion with their colleague in Copenhagen. 86 On February 28, 1924,
Ladenburg gently reminded Kramers that he had promised in January to give
his “opinion on dispersion and its quantum interpretation” 87 within a few
days. A little over a month later, on April 2, Ladenburg wrote another letter
to Kramers, in which he thanked him for sending what must have been either
a manuscript or proofs of (Kramers, 1924a) (which only appeared in the May
10 issue of Nature) and, apparently having been informed by Kramers that
the delay had been due to his wife’s illness, apologized for his impatience. 88

Understandably, given the importance of their own work for Kramers’ break-
through, Ladenburg and Reiche were enthusiastic about the new dispersion
formula. Immediately after the one sentence devoted to the illness of Kramers’
wife, without so much as starting a new paragraph, Ladenburg wrote in his
letter of April 2:

Now your opinion about the dispersion question is of course of the highest
interest and I don’t want to pass up the opportunity to tell you how much
it pleases me that you have managed to give a correspondence derivation
of the relation between dispersion and transition probabilities. In this way
a solid basis has now been created. Your formula . . . is undoubtedly prefer-
able to ours because of its greater generality. I also agree with you that
one cannot extract contributions of the “negative” oscillators from existing
experiments. 89

Ladenburg thus immediately zeroed in on the key experimental question raised
by the new formula. In the late 1920s Ladenburg and his collaborators em-
barked on a ambitious program to verify the second term in the Kramers
dispersion formula experimentally. Reiche, writing to Kramers a week later,
focused on the theoretical justiﬁcation of the new formula:

I wanted to tell you again how delighted I am with your beautiful corre-

86 See Reiche to Kramers, May 9, 1923 and December 28, 1923, and Ladenburg to

extant.

ollection that Kramers already had his new dispersion formula around Christmas
1923.

days later (Reiche to Kramers, April 9, 1924 [AHQP]).

spondence derivation. Following Epstein’s paper [Epstein,1922c] and using
the Born-Pauli [1922] method, I easily derived the classical expression for
P [the polarization] which you indicate in your letter 90 and have also had
no trouble reconstructing the correspondence argument for the transition
to the quantum formula. 91

Fearing that few Germans would have access to Nature, Ladenburg and Reiche
prepared a detailed report on (Kramers, 1924a) for Die Naturwissenschaften.
In late May, Ladenburg asked Kramers whether he would have any objections
if they included a derivation of the new dispersion formula, adding that they
were not sure how close it was to Kramers’ derivation. 92 Kramers welcomed
the idea, telling Ladenburg that their derivation would probably not be all
that diﬀerent from his own. He had every intention of writing a longer paper
on dispersion and absorption himself, he added, which would obviously include
the derivation of his dispersion formula, but recognized that “it will probably
be a while before I have time to write such an article; because of lack of time
I have not thought through many details and I consequently would not mind
it at all if your note appears ﬁrst.” 93 In the end, the editors of Die Natur-
wissenschaften insisted that Ladenburg and Reiche shorten their article. 94 It
was eventually published without the derivation of Kramers’ dispersion for-
mula (Ladenburg and Reiche, 1924).

The distinction of being the ﬁrst to publish a full derivation of this important
result thus fell to Van Vleck. Van Vleck read Kramers’ ﬁrst Nature note not
long after he ﬁnished his papers on a correspondence principle for absorption
(Van Vleck, 1924a,b,c). In a footnote added to the ﬁrst of these, he wrote:

Since the writing of the present article, Dr. H. A. Kramers has published . . . a
very interesting formula for dispersion, in which the polarization is imagined
as coming not from actual orbits, but from “virtual oscillators” such as have
been suggested by Slater and advocated by Bohr. Kramers states that his
formula merges asymptotically [i.e., in the limit of high quantum numbers]
into the classical dispersion. To verify this in the general case, the writer has
computed the classical polarization formula for an arbitrary non-degenerate
multiply periodic orbit . . . By pairing together positive and negative terms
in the Kramers formula, a diﬀerential dispersion may be deﬁned resembling

90 This expression—equivalent eq. (14) below—is not given in (Kramers, 1924a) but
does occur in (Kramers, 1924b, p. 199, eq. 2* ) (reproduced as eq. (50) in sec. 5.1).

the diﬀerential absorption of the present article. It is found that this dif-
ferential quantum theory dispersion approaches asymptotically the classical
dispersion . . . the behavior being very similar to that in the correspondence
principle for absorption. This must be regarded as an important argument
for the Kramers formula (Van Vleck, 1924a, p. 30).

It was not clear to Van Vleck on the basis of Kramers’ note exactly what
Kramers had and had not yet done. Van Vleck thought that his calculations
extended Kramers’ results. As he explained to Kramers in September 1924:

[Van Vleck 1924b, c] was ready to send to the printer about the time we
received the copy of Nature containing your dispersion formula. In your note
[Kramers, 1924a] I did not understand you to state how generally you had
veriﬁed the asymptotic connection with the classical dispersion from the
actual orbit, and it immediately occurred to me that this question could
easily be investigated by the perturbation theory method I had previously
developed in connection with what I call the “correspondence principle for
absorption”. I therefore inserted two sections (# 6 and # 15 . . . ) showing
that your formula merged into the classical one. Inasmuch as the classical
dispersion formula had apparently not been developed for the general non-
degenerate multiply periodic orbit, and as you did not give this in your note
to Nature, I conjectured that you had veriﬁed the asymptotic connection
only in special cases, such as a linear oscillator, so that my computations on
dispersion would not be a duplication of what you had done. However, while
visiting at Cambridge, Mass. last week I learned from Dr. Slater that your
calculation of the asymptotic connection was almost identical with my own
in scope and generality. I have therefore altered the proof of my Physical
Review article to include a note [Van Vleck 1924b, 345] stating that you
have also established the correspondence theorem in the general case. 95

As in the case of Ladenburg and Reiche half a year earlier, Kramers did not
seem to mind at all that Van Vleck was poaching on his preserves. He gen-
erously wrote back to Van Vleck: “Your note on absorption made me much
pleasure and I think it very just of Providence that you got it published before
hearing of our work.” 96

The construction of the dispersion formula (9) requires as a prelude to the ap-
plication of the correspondence principle, a derivation of the classical formula
for the dipole moment of an arbitrary (non-degenerate) multiply-periodic sys-
tem. This is where Ladenburg and Reiche (1923) came up short, even though,
as we saw above, Reiche was able to reconstruct the derivation once Kramers
had outlined it for him. Kramers and Van Vleck, like Epstein before them,
used canonical perturbation techniques from celestial mechanics to derive this

classical formula. In Part Two of our paper, closely following the classical part
of Van Vleck’s two-part paper (Van Vleck, 1924c), we shall present a detailed
derivation of this crucial classical formula, for the special case of the harmonic
oscillator in sec. 5.1 and for a general non-degenerate multiply-periodic sys-
tem in sec. 6.2. Guided by the correspondence principle and introducing the A
and B coeﬃcients we then construct a quantum formula that merges with the
classical formula for high quantum numbers (see secs. 5.1 and 6.2). 97 Here we
summarize the main steps of this derivation.

In general coordinates (qi, pi), Hamilton’s equations are:

˙qi =

∂H
∂pi

,

˙pi = −

∂H
∂qi

,

where dots indicate time derivatives. Given the Hamiltonian H of some multiply-
periodic system, one can often ﬁnd special coordinates (wi, Ji), so-called action-
angle variables, in which Hamilton’s equations take on a particularly simple
form:

˙wi =

= νi,

˙Ji = −

= 0.

∂H
∂wi

∂H
∂Ji

The angle variables, wi = νit, give the characteristic frequencies of the system;
the (conserved) action variables are subject to the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantum
condition, Ji = nih.

Suppose we have a Hamiltonian H that is the sum of H0, describing some
multiply-periodic system representing an electron orbiting the nucleus of an
atom in the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory (or, an inner planet like Mercury orbit-
ing the sun), and Hint = eEx cos 2πνt, a small perturbation describing the
interaction of this system with a weak periodic electric ﬁeld in the x-direction
(or, the periodic weak gravitational interaction with a distant outer planet).
To ﬁnd the induced polarization responsible for dispersion in this system we
need to calculate the coherent part ∆xcoh of the displacement caused by the
perturbation (cf. eqs. (2)–(6) in sec. 3.1). We assume that the unperturbed
system can be solved in action-angle variables, which means that x(t) in the
absence of Hint can be written as a Fourier series:

x(t) =

Aτi(Jl)e2πiτiwi.

τi
X

97 Van Vleck actually does it the other way around: he starts with the quantum
formula and checks that this formula merges with the classical formula in the cor-
respondence limit.

(10)

(11)

(12)

42

The complex amplitudes have to satisfy the conjugacy relations Aτi = A∗
−τi
to ensure that x(t) is real. Assuming the interaction is switched on at t = 0,
we can use Hamilton’s equations in action-angle variables—still those for H0
rather than those for the full Hamiltonian H 98 —to calculate ∆wi and ∆Ji
due to the perturbation. We insert the results into

∆x =

Xk  

∂x
∂Jk

∆Jk +

∂x
∂wk

∆wk

(13)

and collect the coherent terms (i.e., all terms with a factor e2πiνt). The result
is:

∆xcoh = 2eE

X

τi

∂Ji

cos 2πνt.

(14)

For the special case of a charged harmonic oscillator, this expression reduces
to the simple expression (6) found earlier (as we shall show in detail at the
end of sec. 5.1).

We now translate this classical formula into a quantum formula. The idea is
to construct a quantum formula that merges with the classical formula in the
limit of high quantum numbers. This is done in three steps. For high values
of the quantum number i, the derivatives ∂/∂Ji can be replaced by diﬀerence
quotients, 99 the square of the amplitudes Aτi(Jl) by transition probabilities
Ai→j (where |i − j| is small compared to i), and orbital frequencies νi by
transition frequencies νi→j. We then take the leap of faith that the resulting
formula holds for all quantum numbers. Multiplying by the charge −e and
the number of atoms Ni to get from the coherent part of the displacement of
one atom to the polarization of a group of atoms, we arrive at the Kramers
dispersion formula (9).

3.5 Heisenberg’s Umdeutung and dispersion theory

The Kramers dispersion formula was a crucial step in the transition from the
old quantum theory to matrix mechanics, and thereby in the transition from
classical phase spaces to Hilbert spaces. As Kramers pointed out in his second
Nature note, the formula

98 This is where Van Vleck’s calculation diﬀers from those of Born (1924) or
Kramers and Heisenberg (1925).
99 This replacement is known as “Born’s correspondence rule.” In fact, indepen-
dently of one another, both Kramers and Van Vleck had found it before Born. We
shall return to this point in sec. 5.2.

43

only contains such quantities as allow of a direct physical interpretation
on the basis of the fundamental postulates of the quantum theory . . . and
exhibits no further reminiscence of the mathematical theory of multiple [sic]
periodic systems (Kramers, 1924b, p. 311)

This point is ampliﬁed in the Kramers-Heisenberg paper:

we shall obtain, quite naturally, formulae which contain only the frequencies
and amplitudes which are characteristic for the transitions, while all those
symbols which refer to the mathematical theory of periodic systems will
have disappeared (Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925, p. 234, our emphasis).

Orbits do not correspond to observable quantities, but transitions do, namely
to the frequency νi→f of the emitted radiation, and, through the Einstein
coeﬃcients Ai→f , to its intensity. In the introduction of his Umdeutung pa-
per, Heisenberg (1925c) explained that he wanted “to establish a theoretical
quantum mechanics, analogous to classical mechanics, but in which only rela-
tionships between observable quantities occur” (p. 262). In the next sentence
he identiﬁed the Kramers dispersion theory as one of “the most important
ﬁrst steps toward such a quantum-theoretical mechanics” (ibid.).

Rather than using classical mechanics to analyze features of electron orbits
and translating the end result into a quantum formula, as Kramers and others
had done (cf. eqs. (10)–(14) above), Heisenberg translated the Fourier series
for the position of an electron that forms the starting point of such classical
calculations into a quantum expression. He replaced the amplitudes and fre-
quencies by two-index quantities, referring to the initial and ﬁnal state of a
quantum transition, respectively, and thus replaced classical position by an
array of numbers associated with transitions between states. Reinterpreting
rather than replacing the old theory, he assumed that these new quantities
would satisfy all the familiar relations of Newtonian mechanics. Note that
Heisenberg thus formulated a new theory directly in terms of transition quan-
tities without bothering to ﬁnd a representation for the states connected by
the transitions.

The Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition (1) has the form of a restriction
on orbits in phase space. With the elimination of orbits, it could no longer
be used, at least not in its original form. As Heisenberg recalls in his AHQP
interview:

I had, of course, to think about the quantum condition. And that was an
important point. But there I knew so much from Copenhagen how important
this Thomas-Kuhn sum rule was. That took some time. That I think I had
done in G¨ottingen, [I] had seen how I could translate the Thomas-Kuhn sum
rule into what I call a quantum mechanical statement, into a statement in
which only diﬀerences occurred. I did not see that it was a commutation rule

44

[but with this translation] I can bring this sum rule into my whole scheme
and then this sum rule actually ﬁxes everything. I could see that this ﬁxes
the quantization. 100

The Thomas-Kuhn sum rule, a corrolary of the Kramers dispersion formula
(see sec. 7.1 a derivation in modern quantum mechanics), had been found
independently by Werner Kuhn (1899–1963) (1925) in Copenhagen 101 and
by Willy Thomas (1925) in Breslau. 102 Kuhn (i.e., Thomas Kuhn) pressed
Heisenberg a little on how he had settled on this rule as his fundamental
quantization condition: “Using the Kuhn-Thomas [sic] rule is a stroke of ge-
nius but one supposes that there were a lot of other intermediate attempts.”
Apparently there were none. Heisenberg insisted:

No, I would say it was rather trivial for the following reasons: First of all,
there was the integral pdq. Then one had seen that integral pdq sometimes
is 1/2 and sometimes is not 1/2. That played a role. Because then I felt
that perhaps only the diﬀerence of integral pdq between one quantum state
and the next quantum state is an important thing. So I actually felt, “Well,
perhaps I should write down integral pdq in one state minus integral pdq
in the neighboring state.” Then I saw that if I write down this and try to
translate it according to the scheme of the dispersion theory, then I get the
Thomas-Kuhn sum rule. And that is the point. Then I thought, “Well, that
is apparently the way how it is done.” 103

In other words, following the general recipe introduced in the Umdeutung
paper for the translation of classical formulae into quantum-mechanical ones—
“the scheme of the dispersion theory”—Heisenberg (1925c, p. 268) was able
to convert a derivative of the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition into an equation
that contains only amplitudes and frequencies. Since Heisenberg’s theory only
deals with transitions between states, the absolute value of the action J does
not matter; only the diﬀerence in J-value between two states does. 104

100P. 10 of the transcript of session 7 of the AHQP interview with Heisenberg
101The publication of Kuhn’s paper had been delayed in typical Copenhagen fashion:
“A paper on the summation rule had been submitted to Prof. Bohr and Prof.
Kramers about half a year before the ﬁnal one, but it was rejected at that time
because it contained besides the main good argument some unsuitable passages”
(Werner Kuhn to Thomas Kuhn, May 3, 1962 [included in the folder on Kuhn in
the AHQP])

emphasis).

passage from the AHQP interview quoted above is not mentioned in the Umdeutung
paper.

45

The sum rule is sometimes called the Thomas-Kuhn-Reiche sum rule because
Reiche and Thomas (1925) were the ﬁrst to publish a detailed derivation of
it in a paper submitted to the Zeitschrift f¨ur Physik in early August 1925
about a month before (Heisenberg, 1925c) appeared in the same journal. In
formulating the goal of their paper, Reiche and Thomas not only used the
term ‘Umdeutung’ in very much the same way as Heisenberg in his Umdeutung
paper, they also explicitly tied this usage to Kramers’ dispersion theory:

We use . . . the correspondence principle in the same way in which it was
applied by Kramers in the derivation of the dispersion formula by rein-
terpreting (umdeuten) the mechanical orbital frequencies as radiation fre-
quencies, the Fourier coeﬃcients as the “characteristic amplitudes” that
determine the quantum radiation, and, ﬁnally, in analogy to the Bohr fre-
quency condition, 105 diﬀerential quotients as diﬀerence quotients. In the
realm of high quantum numbers the classical and quantum-theoretical rep-
resentations become identical. We try to arrive at a general relation, by
maintaining the reinterpretation (Umdeutung) of classical quantities into
quantum-theoretical ones for all quantum numbers (Reiche and Thomas,
1925, pp. 511–512).

In view of the tendency of European theorists to neglect American contri-
butions (see sec. 2.4), it is also interesting to note that Reiche and Thomas
(1925, p. 513) cite (Van Vleck, 1924b).

Although he failed to recognize the importance of the result at the time, Van
Vleck had, in fact, been the ﬁrst to ﬁnd the sum rule (Sopka, 1988, p. 135,
note 184). As he wrote in his NRC Bulletin:

Eq. (62a) [a version of the sum rule] appears to have been ﬁrst incidentally
suggested by the writer [Van Vleck 1924c, pp. 359–360, footnote 43] and
then was later and independently much more strongly advanced by Thomas
. . . Kuhn . . . and Reiche and Thomas (Van Vleck, 1926, p. 152).

Van Vleck is referring to a footnote in the section on dispersion in the classical
part of his paper. In this footnote he mentioned two objections that explain
why he did not put greater emphasis on the sum rule himself. Van Vleck’s
idea—which he calls “tempting (but probably futile)” (Van Vleck, 1924c, p.
359, footnote 43)—was that the sum rule would allow him to compute the
Einstein A coeﬃcients. He was under the impression, however, that “such a
method is hard to reconcile with the [experimental] work of F. C. Hoyt [1923,
1924]” on X-ray absorption and that it “would lead to transitions from positive
to negative quantum numbers, which can scarcely correspond to any physical

105In the limit of high quantum numbers, the Bohr frequency condition, νi→j =
(Ei − Ej)/h, merges with the relation νi = ∂H/∂Ji (cf. eq. (11)). Van Vleck (1924b,
p. 333) calls this the correspondence theorem for frequencies.

reality” (ibid.).

As Heisenberg (1925c, pp. 269–270) shows brieﬂy in his paper, the sum rule
follows from the Kramers dispersion formula (9) if one takes the limit in which
the frequency ν of the incident radiation is much greater than any of the
absorption frequencies νi→j (see sec. 7.1). That the quantization condition
obtained by massaging the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition also follows from the
Kramers dispersion theory, widely recognized as one of the most secure parts
of the old quantum theory, clearly bolstered Heisenberg’s conﬁdence in the
translation procedure of his Umdeutung paper. It was left to Born and Jordan
(1925b) to extract the now standard commutation relations for position and
momentum from the Thomas-Kuhn sum rule (in sec. 7.1 we shall show in
detail how this is done). That Heisenberg stopped short of making this move,
as we shall argue in sec. 7.1, is largely because he was thinking in terms of the
positions and velocities of the Lagrangian formalism rather than in terms of
the positions and momenta of the Hamiltonian formalism.

Although Heisenberg thus relied heavily on dispersion theory in his Umdeu-
tung paper, he gave his positivist methodology pride of place. His positivism
probably came from a variety of sources. Pauli, Heisenberg’s fellow student and
frequent discussion partner (both in person and in writing), was a devoted fol-
lower of his godfather Ernst Mach (1838–1916). 106 As Pauli had written to
Bohr, for instance, on December 12, 1924:

We must not . . . put the atoms in the shackles of our prejudices (of which in
my opinion the assumption of the existence of electron orbits in the sense
of the ordinary kinematics is an example); on the contrary, we must adapt
our concepts to experience (Bohr, 1972–1996, Vol. 5, pp. 35–36).

We already mentioned in sec. 1.1 that Heisenberg himself later claimed that
his positivist attitude came in part from his reading of Einstein’s 1905 special
relativity paper. 107 His biographer David Cassidy (1991, p. 198) makes the
suggestive observation that Born and Jordan (1925a, p. 493), in a paper com-
pleted by June 11, 1925, not only emphasized the observability principle but
also appealed to Einstein’s analysis of distant simultaneity in support of it.

As Helge Kragh (1999) notes: “there was no royal road from the observability
principle to quantum mechanics” (p. 162). This truism is nicely illustrated by
a conversation between Einstein and Heisenberg reported years later by the
latter. The following exchange supposedly took place in Berlin in the spring
of 1926:

“But you don’t seriously believe,” Einstein protested, “that none but ob-

106On Pauli’s positivism, see, e.g., (Hendry, 1984, pp. 19–23) and (Gustavson, 2004).

47

servable magnitudes must go into a physical theory?” “Isn’t that precisely
what you have done with relativity?” I asked in some surprise . . . “Possibly
I did use this kind of reasoning,” Einstein admitted, “but it is nonsense all
the same” (Heisenberg, 1971, p. 63). 108

With his S-matrix program in the 1940s, 109 Heisenberg once again tried to
force a theoretical breakthrough by restricting himself to observable quanti-
ties, this time with the qualiﬁcation that he had taken to heart Einstein’s
lesson that, in the end, it is the theory that determines what the observables
are. Heisenberg (1971, p. 63) has Einstein make this point a few sentences
after the passage quoted above and acknowledges it as a source of inspiration
for his 1927 uncertainty principle. Nearly two decades after the Umdeutung
paper, Heisenberg (1943) wrote: “in this situation it seems useful to raise the
question which concepts of the present theory can be retained in the future
theory, and this question is roughly equivalent to a diﬀerent question, namely
which quantities of the current theory are “observable” . . . Of course, it will
always only be decided by the completed theory which quantities are truly
“observable”” (p. 514).

As Einstein complained in 1917 in a letter to his friend Michele Besso (1873–
1955), referring to the excessive Machian positivism of their mutual acquain-
tance Friedrich Adler (1879–1960): “He is riding the Machian nag [den Mach-
schen Klepper] to exhaustion.” In a follow-up letter he elaborated: “It cannot
give birth to anything living, it can only stamp out harmful vermin.” 110 This
is true in the case of matrix mechanics as well. Heisenberg’s positivism would
have been perfectly sterile if it had not been for Kramers’ dispersion theory.
In that context, positivism was not a blanket injunction against unobservable
quantities in general but was directed at a speciﬁc set of increasingly prob-
lematic unobservables, the electron orbits of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory.

4 The Bohr-Kramers-Slater (BKS) theory as a detour on the road

from dispersion theory to matrix mechanics

4.1 Virtual oscillators and virtual radiation

Kramers presented his work on dispersion theory in the context of the BKS
theory, not just in the two preliminary notes to Nature discussed in sec. 3.4,
but also in the authoritative exposition of his dispersion theory in the paper
with Heisenberg. In the abstract of this paper, the authors announce that

[t]he arguments are based throughout on the interpretation of the connec-
tion of the wave radiation of the atom with the stationary states advocated
in a recent paper by Bohr, Kramers and Slater [1924a,b], and the conclu-
sions, should they be conﬁrmed, would form an interesting support for this
interpretation (Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925, p. 223). 111

It should thus come as no surprise that the Kramers dispersion theory has
been portrayed as an application of the BKS theory in most older and even in
some more recent historical literature. 112 Max Jammer (1966), for instance,
writes that the BKS theory “was the point of departure of Kramers’s de-
tailed theory of dispersion” (p. 184). Mara Beller (1999) still characterized
(Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925) as a paper that “spelled out, in a rigorous
mathematical way, the ideas only roughly outlined in the presentation of Bohr,
Kramers, and Slater” (p. 23). More than a decade earlier, Dresden (1987, pp.
144–146, pp. 220–221) had in fact already set the record straight. 113 Darrigol
(1992, p. 225) duly emphasizes that the Kramers dispersion theory was de-
veloped before and independently of the BKS theory. Even before Dresden,
Hendry (1981) had already made it clear that BKS got its virtual oscillators
from dispersion theory—the substitute oscillators of (Ladenburg and Reiche,
1923)—and not the other way around. We brieﬂy review the evidence in sup-
port of the italicized claims above.

We know from the passage quoted in sec. 3.4 from a letter from Slater to Van
Vleck that by the time the former arrived in Copenhagen around Christmas

111We use the translation of Stolzenburg (1984, p. 87) at this point, which is more
accurate than the standard translation in (Van der Waerden, 1968, p. 223).
112There is an extensive literature on the BKS theory; see, e.g., (Klein, 1970, pp.
23–39), (Stuewer, 1975, pp. 291–305), (Hendry, 1981), the dissertation of Neil
Wasserman (1981), (Mehra and Rechenberg, 1982–2001, Vol. 1, sec. V.2), the essay
by Klaus Stolzenburg (1984) in (Bohr, 1972–1996, Vol. 5, pp. 3–96), and (Dresden,
1987, pp. 159–215).
113See (Dresden, 1987, p. 221) for a helpful chronology of events in 1923–1925 per-
taining to BKS and dispersion theory.

49

1923 Kramers already had his dispersion formula. Kramers must have used
the substitute oscillators of Ladenburg and Reiche (1923) at that point even
though by the time he ﬁnally got around to publishing his formula he called
them virtual oscillators (see sec. 3.4). Slater’s arrival in Copenhagen marks
the lower limit for the birth of the BKS theory. The theory, after all, grew
around an idea that Slater hit upon shortly before he left for Europe late
that year. 114 Slater suggested that the wave and particle properties of light
might be reconciled by having an electromagnetic ﬁeld guide corpuscular light
quanta. 115 Bohr and Kramers cannibalized Slater’s idea and stripped it of all
reference to light quanta. Against his better judgment—as he insisted decades
later in a letter of November 4, 1964 to van der Waerden (1968, p. 13)—Slater
went along and his idea entered the literature via the BKS paper. In a short
letter sent to Nature a week after this joint paper had been submitted, Slater
explained how Bohr and Kramers had convinced him of their point of view.
Accordingly, he presented his idea couched in BKS terms:

Any atom may, in fact, be supposed to communicate with other atoms all
the time it is in a stationary state, by means of a virtual ﬁeld of radia-
tion originating from oscillators having the frequencies of possible quantum
transitions and the function of which is to provide for the statistical con-
servation of energy and momentum by determining the probabilities for
quantum transitions (Slater, 1924, p. 307).

The ﬁnal clause about the statistical conservation of energy and momentum
was foisted upon Slater by Bohr and Kramers. 116 Bohr had been contemplat-
ing such a move for several years, as can be inferred, for instance, from corre-
spondence with Ehrenfest in 1921 in connection with the third Solvay congress
held that year (Klein, 1970, p. 19) and with Darwin in 1922 (Stolzenburg, 1984,
pp. 13–19). Slater’s concept of virtual radiation emitted while an atom is in
a stationary state ﬁt nicely with Bohr’s tentative ideas concerning the mech-
anism of emission and absorption of radiation. In secs. 3.2–3.3, we quoted
various comments by Bohr on dispersion from the period 1916–1923 showing
how he came to embrace the notion that an atom interacts with radiation like
a set of oscillators.

The concept of virtual oscillators is often attributed to Slater, not just by
later historians (see, e.g., Stuewer, 1975, p. 291, p. 303) but also by his con-
temporaries. In the abstract of (Van Vleck, 1924b), for instance, we read that

already made similar suggestions (Hendry, 1981, p. 199; Darrigol, 1992, p. 218).

the Kramers dispersion formula “assumes the dispersion to be due not to the
actual orbits but to Slater’s ‘virtual’ or ‘ghost’ oscillators having the spectro-
scopic rather than orbital frequencies” (p. 330). 117 In the BKS paper itself,
however, the concept is unambiguously attributed to Ladenburg: 118

The correspondence principle has led to comparing the reaction of an atom
on a ﬁeld of radiation with the reaction on such a ﬁeld which, according
to the classical theory of electrodynamics, should be expected from a set
of ‘virtual’ harmonic oscillators with frequencies equal to those determined
by [hν = E1 − E2] for the various possible transitions between station-
ary states. 119 Such a picture has been used by Ladenburg 120 in an at-
tempt to connect the experimental results on dispersion quantitatively with
considerations on the probability of transitions between stationary states
(Bohr, Kramers, and Slater, 1924a, pp. 163–164).

As we saw in sec. 3.3, Ladenburg and Reiche in turn attributed the idea to
Bohr. In 1924, for instance, they wrote:

Formally, we can describe the relation [between oscillator strengths and
transition probabilities] following an assumption introduced by Bohr [1923b,
pp. 161–162], by imagining that the atom responds to external radiation like
a system of electrical oscilators, whose characteristic frequencies ν agree
with the emitted or absorbed frequencies in possible quantum transitions
(Ladenburg and Reiche, 1924, p. 672).

In the next sentence they use their own term “substitute oscillators” (in quo-
tation marks) and add: “(now called “virtual oscillators”)” (ibid.). Likewise, in
the introduction of the opening installment of a series of papers on the experi-
mental veriﬁcation of the Kramers dispersion formula, Ladenburg talks about
“the “substitute oscillators”,” which were introduced, “at Bohr’s suggestion,
as the carriers of the scattered radiation needed for dispersion” (Ladenburg,
1928, p. 16). 121

117See also (Van Vleck, 1924a, p. 30), quoted in sec. 3.4, and (Van Vleck, 1926, p.
163).
118The mistakes with the prepositions in the passage below (‘reaction on’ instead of
‘reaction to’ and ‘considerations on’ instead of ‘considerations of’) would tend to
support Slater’s claim that the paper was “written entirely by Bohr and Kramers”
(Slater to Van Vleck, July 27, 1924, quoted in sec. 2.2).
119At this point, the authors refer to Ch. III, sec. 3 of the (English translation
of) (Bohr, 1923b), the section in which (Ladenburg, 1921) is discussed and which
triggered the correspondence between Bohr and Ladenburg discussed in sec. 3.3.
120At this point, the authors append a footnote referring to (Ladenburg, 1921) and
(Ladenburg and Reiche, 1923).
121The passage from which these clauses are taken is quoted in full at the beginning
of sec. 7.

Bohr had communicated the idea in a letter to Ladenburg (see sec. 3.3). This
may explain why, when interviewed for the AHQP, Reiche did not remember
who originally came up with it:

I do not know whether we or Kramers ﬁrst used this terminology of virtual
oscillators . . . It might be it is Kramers. If it was Kramers then we certainly
at once incorporated it into our thinking. 122

In his AHQP interview with Slater, Kuhn also asked about virtual oscillators:

to what extent did that come from [the BKS] paper, to what extent does
it really go back to the Ladenburg, and Ladenburg-Reiche? It could have
grown out [of the] Ladenburg and Ladenburg-Reiche papers, yet my impres-
sion from the literature is that there was little done with that until after
the Bohr-Kramers-Slater paper. 123

Slater concurred, though his comments would have been more valuable had
he not been asked such a leading question:

I think that’s true. Of course, I was very familiar with the Ladenburg-Reiche
things, 124 so was Bohr. I think that we helped popularize it in a sense. Of
course, this also came at the same time, approximately, that Kramers was
working on his dispersion formula. That again is operating with things very
much like the virtual oscillator, so they all seem to hang together, and
I think it was a combination of the oscillators from our paper, from the
Ladenburg-Reiche, and the Heisenberg-Kramers dispersion that really set
them in operation. 125

Despite the loaded question that elicited this response and even though Slater
is wrong to suggest that BKS and Kramers’ dispersion theory were developed
independently of the earlier work of Ladenburg and Reiche, the overall char-
acterization of the situation seems to be accurate. BKS oﬃcially sanctioned
the dual representation of the atom as simultaneously a quantum system `a la
Einstein and Bohr and a set of oscillators `a la Lorentz and Drude. This dual
picture had been implicit in (Ladenburg, 1921). It was made explicit, under
Bohr’s inﬂuence, in (Ladenburg and Reiche, 1923). That it was endorsed by
the highest authorities in Copenhagen undoubtedly helped its dissemination.
Even so it was typically presented with some trepidation. In his second Nature

122See p. 11 of the transcript of session 3 of the interview with Reiche. It could be,
however, that Reiche was only referring to the new term for the Bohr-Ladenburg-
Reiche concept of substitute oscillators.

note, Kramers passed it oﬀ as merely a matter of words: 126

In this connexion it may be emphasized that the notation ‘virtual oscillator’
used in my former letter [Kramers, 1924a] does not mean the introduction
of any additional hypothetical mechanism, but is meant only as a terminol-
ogy suitable to characterise certain main features of the connexion between
the description of optical phenomena and the theoretical interpretation of
spectra (Kramers, 1924b, p. 311).

Van Vleck was more upfront:

The introduction of these virtual resonators is, to be sure, in some ways
very artiﬁcial, but is nevertheless apparently the most satisfactory way of
combining the elements of truth in both the classical and quantum theories.
In particular this avoids the otherwise almost insuperable diﬃculty that it
is the spectroscopic rather than the orbital frequencies . . . which ﬁgure in
dispersion (Van Vleck, 1924b, p. 344).

Despite such disclaimers, Kramers and Van Vleck—as well as Slater, Born,
Breit and others working in the general area of dispersion theory in 1924–
1925—used a model of the atom in which the electron orbits of the Bohr-
Sommerfeld theory were supplemented by an “orchestra of virtual oscilla-
tors” 127 with characteristic frequencies corresponding to each and every tran-
sition that an electron in a given orbit can undergo. Thanks to virtual oscilla-
tors—to paraphrase Heisenberg’s succinct statement to van der Waerden (1968,
p. 29) in 1963—at least something in the atom was vibrating with the right
frequency again.

The dual representation of physical systems (of electrons rather than atoms
in this case) was also key to the BKS explanation of the Compton eﬀect. BKS
was Bohr’s last stand against light quanta after the Compton eﬀect had ﬁnally
convinced most other physicists that they were unavoidable (Klein, 1970, p.
3). 128 BKS explains the Compton eﬀect without light quanta. It attributes
the frequency shift between incoming and scattered X-rays to a Doppler shift
in the X-ray wave fronts instead. Compton (1923) thought this option was
ruled out because, as he showed in his paper, the recoil velocity needed to get
the right Doppler shift is diﬀerent from the recoil velocity needed to ensure
conservation of energy and momentum in the process, and one and the same
electron cannot recoil with two diﬀerent velocities. In the BKS theory, however,

126In the work that led to (Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925), however, Kramers, ac-
cording to Hendry (1981), “ignored their virtual nature altogether and treated the
oscillator model as naively as he had the orbital model” (p. 202).
127The term “virtual orchestra” comes from (Land´e, 1926, p. 456) (Jammer, 1966,
p. 187).
128Cf. our comments in the introduction to sec. 3.

there is room for two recoil velocities, one for the electron itself, one for the
orchestra of virtual oscillators associated with it. 129 The Compton eﬀect can
be interpreted as a Doppler shift if the appropriate recoil velocity is assigned to
the virtual oscillators. Energy and momentum can be conserved if a diﬀerent
recoil velocity is assigned to the electrons themselves. Bohr and his co-authors
wasted few words on the justiﬁcation of this startling maneuver:

That in this case the virtual oscillator moves with a velocity diﬀerent from
that of the illuminated electrons themselves is certainly a feature strikingly
unfamiliar to the classical conceptions. In view of the fundamental depar-
tures from the classical space-time description, involved in the very idea of
virtual oscillators, it seems at the present state of science hardly justiﬁable
to reject a formal interpretation as that under consideration as inadequate
(Bohr, Kramers, and Slater, 1924a, p. 173).

This is almost as bad as pieces of glass dragging along diﬀerent amounts of
ether for diﬀerent colors of light in early-19th-century ether theory (see sec.
3.1)!

The problem carries over to the dispersion theory based on the dual represen-
tation of atoms in terms of classical orbits and virtual oscillators, as is acknowl-
edged, if only in passing, by Kramers and Heisenberg (1925): “We shall not
discuss in any detail the curious fact that the centre of these spherical waves
moves relative to the excited atom” (p. 229). This exacerbated the problem
of the Bohr-Sommerfeld orbits in the theory. Not only were they responsible
for the discrepancy between orbital frequencies and radiation frequencies, they
also make it harder to picture an atom in space and time. After all, the system
of electron orbits does not even move in concert with its orchestra of virtual
oscillators.

Edward MacKinnon (1977, 1982) has suggested that the resulting problem
of combining diﬀerent pictures of the atom into one coherent picture forced
Heisenberg to make a choice between them (see also Beller, 1999, p. 23). Since
the virtual oscillators carry all the physical information while the electron
orbits are completely unobservable, the choice is obvious. MacKinnon (1977, p.
138) has gone as far as describing Heisenberg’s Umdeutung paper as proposing
a theory of virtual oscillators. Of course, there is no explicit reference to virtual
oscillators anywhere in the Umdeutung paper. MacKinnon (1977, pp. 155–156,
162, 177) speculates that this is because Heisenberg suppressed all talk about
virtual oscillators as a response to Pauli’s objections to the “virtualization”

129What Compton (1923) actually said in his paper is very suggestive of this option:
“It is clear . . . that so far as the eﬀect on the wave-length is concerned, we may
replace the recoiling electron by a scattering electron” with an “eﬀective velocity”
diﬀerent from that of the recoiling electron (p. 487; quoted and discussed in Stuewer,
1975, p. 230).

of physics. 130 We shall return to the relation between BKS and Heisenberg’s
work in sec. 4.3.

Pauli had originally promised not to subvert Bohr’s eﬀorts to get the physics
community to accept the term ‘virtual’ as used in the context of BKS. Working
on the German translation of the paper (Bohr, Kramers, and Slater, 1924b),
Bohr was anxious to ensure that Pauli approved of “the words “communicate”
and “virtual”, for after lengthy consideration, we have agreed here on these
basic pillars of the exposition.” 131 In typical Bohr fashion, he ﬁrst announced
that the manuscript would be submitted that same day and that he would
enclose a copy, then added a postscript saying that there had been further
delays and that it would be sent later. 132 Amused, Pauli wrote back a few
days later:

I laughed a little (you will certainly forgive me for that) about your warm
recommendation of the words “communicate” and “virtual” and about your
postscript that the manuscript is still not yet completed. On the basis of
my knowledge of these two words (which I deﬁnitely promise you not to
undermine), I have tried to guess what your paper may deal with. But I
have not succeeded. 133

The term ‘virtual’ also puzzled the group of physicists in Ann Arbor studying
the BKS paper with Bohr’s former associate Klein, who wrote to Bohr on
June 30, 1924: “Colby [cf. note 36], who is also most interested in it, asked me
about the meaning of the term ‘virtual radiation’” (Stolzenburg, 1984, p. 29).

Exactly what does the ‘virtual’ in virtual oscillator and virtual radiation
mean? Virtual oscillators can be thought of in analogy to virtual images in ge-
ometric optics. Just as the light reﬂected from a mirror appears to come from
an imaginary point behind the mirror, the light scattered by an atom appears
to come from an imaginary oscillator. This analogy, however, is nowhere to be
found in the BKS paper. Whatever its exact meaning, the designation ‘virtual’
does serve as a warning that these oscillators are not just classical oscillators.
The authors warn, for instance, that “the absorption and emission of radiation
are coupled to diﬀerent processes of transition, and thereby to diﬀerent virtual
oscillators” (Bohr, Kramers, and Slater, 1924a, p. 171). The virtual oscillators

130In a letter of January 8, 1925, Heisenberg told Bohr that Pauli did not believe “in
virtual oscillators and is outraged at the ‘virtualization’ of physics” (MacKinnon,
1977, p. 156).
131Bohr to Pauli, February 16, 1924 (Bohr, 1972–1996, Vol. 5, p. 409).
132Contrary to what is suggested by these delays, the German translation simply
follows the English original.
133Pauli to Bohr, February 21, 1924 (Bohr, 1972–1996, Vol. 5, p. 412; our emphasis).
Our reading of this letter diﬀers from that of Hendry (1981), who characterized it
as “mocking” (p. 202).

are, as Darrigol (1992) summarizes the situation, “nothing but a condensed
expression of their eﬀects, which could be deduced from the correspondence
principle piece by piece but could not be synthesized in any classical model”
(p. 257).

Unlike the light coming from virtual images in geometric optics, the radiation
coming from virtual oscillators is also called virtual in the BKS paper. Again,
it is not exactly clear why. As the analogy with geometric optics shows, that
a source is virtual does not necessarily mean that the radiation is virtual as
well. In Slater’s original conception, the radiation might be called virtual in
the sense that the light quanta are the primary reality and that the radiation
is there only to guide them. In the BKS theory, however, there are no light
quanta, only the radiation.

The way Heisenberg later remembered it, the virtual radiation of the BKS
theory had the same status as the Schr¨odinger wave function in Born’s statis-
tical interpretation a few years later. As Heisenberg told Kuhn in his AHQP
interview:

everybody felt that paper [BKS] contained an essential part of truth . . . What
Bohr, Kramers, and Slater did was to establish the probability as a kind of
reality . . . one felt that by making the probability become some kind of real-
ity, you get hold of something which is there. It was at that time of course,
very diﬃcult to say what it was that you had gotten hold of. I would say
only through the paper of Born [1926] did it become quite clear that one
should say, “All right, the Schr¨odinger wave means that probability that
an electron should be there.” But the main point was that the probability
itself was something real. It was not only in the mind of the people, but it
was something in nature . . . Up to that time people had two possibilities.
One possibility was that the reality is a wave. There is an electric ﬁeld, and
a magnetic ﬁeld acting upon an atom, shaking the electron, and then the
atom does something, it makes a transition . . . There is an entirely diﬀerent
picture of reality in which there is a light quantum . . . hitting the atom, and
then something happens. But now the idea is that there is a wave. But this
wave is not the reality. This wave is a probability—this wave is a tendency.
It means that when this wave is present then the atom gets a tendency
to emit light quanta. So this idea of the wave ﬁeld being a tendency was
something just in the middle between reality and non-reality . . . That was
the striking thing about it, you know, this new invention of a possibility
which was a reality in some way but not a real reality—a half reality. 134

Unsurprisingly, Born took exception to Heisenberg’s suggestion that the Born
interpretation had been anticipated in this way by BKS. As Heisenberg said

134P. 2 of the transcript of session 4 of the AHQP interview with Heisenberg

56

in a subsequent session of the interview: “I felt once, when I discussed this
matter with Born, that he was a bit angry that I had quoted too much the
Bohr-Kramers-Slater paper in connection with the probability interpretation
of waves.” 135 We sympathize with Born. Heisenberg’s comments, we feel, have
all the ﬂavor of an after-the-fact rationalization.

In subsequent expositions of the BKS theory by both Kramers and Slater, the
radiation from virtual oscillators is presented as every bit as real as the external
radiation. It is hard to see how this could be otherwise since the two types of ra-
diation are supposed to interfere with one another. Bohr, Kramers, and Slater
(1924a) write: “we shall assume that [illuminated atoms] will act as secondary
sources of virtual wave radiation which interferes with the incident radiation”
(p. 167, our emphasis). A few pages later, they talk about the same “secondary
wavelets set up by each of the illuminated atoms” (ibid., p. 172) without la-
beling them virtual. On the following page they suddenly refer to the external
radiation as “incident virtual radiation” (ibid., p. 173, our emphasis). And the
ﬁnal paragraph of the paper discusses the “(virtual) radiation ﬁeld” (ibid.,
p. 175) produced by ordinary antennas. The concluding sentence, which has
Bohr written all over it, shows how the authors struggled with their own ter-
minology:

It will in this connexion be observed that the emphasizing of the ‘virtual’
character of the radiation ﬁeld, which at the present state of science seems
so essential for an adequate description of atomic phenomena, automati-
cally loses its importance in a limiting case like that just considered [i.e.,
a classical antenna], where the ﬁeld, as regards its observable interaction
with matter, is endowed with all the attributes of an electromagnetic ﬁeld
in classical electrodynamics (Bohr, Kramers, and Slater, 1924a, p. 175).

Subsequent expositions of the BKS theory by Slater and Kramers removed
much of the tentativeness of this passage.

In a lengthy paper signed December 1, 1924, and published in the April 1925
issue of The Physical Review, Slater tried to work out a “consistent detailed
theory of optical phenomena” based on the BKS theory (Slater, 1925a, p. 395).
Slater presented this work at a meeting of the American Physical Society in
Washington, D.C., in December 1924 (Slater, 1925b). At this same meeting—
which also marked the end of the controversy between Compton and Harvard’s
William Duane (1872–1935) over the Compton eﬀect (Stuewer, 1975, p. 273)—
Van Vleck (1925) talked about (Van Vleck, 1924b,c) and Breit (1925a) talked
about (Breit, 1924a). 136 Slater sent a copy of his paper to Bohr in December

135P. 21 of the transcript of session 6 of the AHQP interview with Heisenberg.

1924 and defended his elaboration of the BKS theory in a letter to Bohr of
January 6, 1925 (Bohr, 1972–1996, Vol. 5, pp. 65–66).

In the introduction of his paper, Slater presents the dilemma that led him to
embrace Bohr’s statistical conservation laws. 137 The problem, he argues, is
that

in the quantum theory the energy of atoms must change by jumps; and
in the electromagnetic theory the energy of a radiation ﬁeld must change
continuously . . . Two paths of escape from this diﬃculty have been followed
with more or less success. The ﬁrst is to redeﬁne energy [i.e., to adopt
Einstein’s light-quantum hypothesis]; the second to discard conservation.
Optical theory on [the ﬁrst interpretation] would be a set of laws telling in
what paths the quanta travel . . . [One way to do this is] to set up a sort of
ghost ﬁeld, similar to the classical ﬁeld, whose function was in some way to
guide the quanta. For example, the quanta might travel in the direction of
Poynting’s vector in such a ﬁeld. The author was at one time of the opinion
that this method was the most hopeful one for solving the problem . . . The
other direction of escape from the conﬂict between quantum theory and
wave theory has been to retain intact the quantum theory and as much of
the wave theory as relates to the ﬁeld, but to discard conservation of energy
in the interaction between them (Slater, 1925a, pp. 396–397).

Slater sketches some diﬃculties facing this second approach, but makes it clear
that this is the approach he now favors:

An attempt was made by the writer, in a note to Nature [Slater, 1924], en-
larged upon in collaboration with Bohr and Kramers, to contribute slightly
to the solution of these diﬃculties. In the present paper, the suggestions
made in those papers are developed into a more speciﬁc theory (ibid., p.
398).

Slater then describes more carefully how to picture the interaction between
matter and radiation in the BKS theory and makes it clear that the pro-
posed mechanism is incompatible with strict energy conservation. According
to Slater, the “one . . . essentially new” suggestion of BKS (note that he does
not claim credit for the concept of virtual oscillators) was:

that the wavelets sent out by an atom in connection with a given transition
were sent out, not as a consequence of the occurrence of the transition, but
as a consequence of the existence of the atom in the stationary state from
which it could make that transition. 138 On this assumption, the stationary

137See also the brief discussion of the BKS theory in (Van Vleck, 1926, pp. 285–286).
138Note the similarity with the comments of Bohr to Ladenburg quoted in sec. 3.3:
“the quantum jumps are not the direct cause of the absorption of radiation, but

58

state is the time during which the atom is radiating or absorbing; the tran-
sition from one state to another is not accompanied by radiation, but so far
as the ﬁeld is concerned, merely marks the end of the radiation or absorp-
tion characteristic of one state, and the beginning of that characteristic of
another. The radiation emitted or absorbed during the stationary state is
further not merely of the particular frequency connected with the transition
which the atom is going to make; it includes all the frequencies connected
with all the transitions which the atom could make . . . Although the atom
is radiating or absorbing during the stationary states, its own energy does
not vary, but changes only discontinuously at transitions . . . It is quite ob-
vious that the mechanism becomes possible only by discarding conservation
(ibid., pp. 397–398).

On the next page, Slater inserts a disclaimer similar to the one by Van Vleck
quoted above:

It must be admitted that a theory of the kind suggested has unattractive
features; there is an apparent duplication between the atoms on the one
hand, and the mechanism of oscillators producing the ﬁeld on the other.
But this duplication seems to be indicated by the experimental facts, and it
is diﬃcult at the present stage to see how it is to be avoided (ibid., p. 399).

Slater’s portrayal of the BKS theory agrees with the exposition given by
Kramers and Helge Holst (1871–1944) in the German edition (Kramers and Holst,
1925) of a popular book on Bohr’s atomic theory originally published in Dan-
ish (Kramers and Holst, 1922). 139 In a section, entitled “Bohr’s new concep-
tion of the fundamental postulates,” that was added to the German edition,
Kramers explained that the BKS theory breaks with one of the basic tenets
of Bohr’s original theory, namely that atoms only emit light when one of its
electrons makes a transition from, to use his example, the second to the ﬁrst
stationary state. “According to the new conception,” Kramers wrote, “radia-
tion with frequency ν2−1 is still tied to the possibility of a transition to the ﬁrst
state, but it is assumed that the emission takes place during the entire time
the atom is in the second state” (Kramers and Holst, 1925, p. 135). Another
diﬀerence is that “if the atom is in the third state, it will simultaneously emit
the frequencies ν3−2 and ν3−1 until it either jumps to the second or to the
ﬁrst state” (ibid.). Kramers emphasizes that this makes the new conception
preferable to Bohr’s original one from the point of view of the correspondence
principle:

. . . represent an eﬀect which accompanies the continuously disperging (and absorb-
ing) eﬀect of the atom on the radiation” (Bohr, 1972–1996, Vol. 5, p. 400).
139The translation was done by Fritz Arndt (1885–1969), a chemist and a colleague
of Ladenburg and Reiche in Breslau (see the correspondence between Kramers and
Ladenburg of 1923–1925 in the AHQP). The preface of this translation is dated
March 1925.

59

This situation shows that the new conception is closer to the classical elec-
tron theory than the old one; the simultaneous emission of two frequencies
mentioned above has its counterpart in that an electron moving on an el-
lipse emits both its fundamental tone and its ﬁrst overtone . . . while earlier
one had to assume that these two frequencies were produced by diﬀerent
transitions in diﬀerent atoms. Especially from the point of view of the cor-
respondence principle is it a pleasure to welcome the fact that the radiation
emitted by a single atom contains all the frequencies that correspond to
possible transitions; for in the border region of large quantum numbers the
radiation demanded by the quantum theory will now merge very smoothly
with the radiation demanded by the classical theory (Kramers and Holst,
1925, pp. 135–136).

The ﬁnal paragraph of the BKS paper itself, from which we quoted above, can
be seen as a garbled version of Kramers’ argument here. Note that the term
‘virtual radiation’ is absent from these expositions by Slater and Kramers. 140

4.2 The demise of BKS

The BKS theory was decisively refuted in experiments by Walther Bothe
(1891–1957) and Hans Geiger (1882–1945) in Berlin and by Compton and
Alfred Walter Simon in Chicago. These experiments showed that energy-
momentum is strictly conserved in Compton scattering (i.e., event by event)
and not just statistically (Stuewer, 1975, pp. 299–302; Stolzenburg, 1984, pp.
75–80). The experiments were begun shortly after the BKS paper was pub-
lished (see Bothe and Geiger, 1924), but the ﬁnal verdict did not come in
until the following year. Bothe and Geiger (1925a,b) published their results in
April 1925. The paper by Compton and Simon (1925) is signed June 23, 1925,
and appeared in September 1925. 141 On April 17, 1925, Geiger sent Bohr a
letter forewarning him of the results of his experiments with Bothe. When
Geiger’s letter arrived in Copenhagen four days later, Bohr was in the process
of writing to Ralph H. Fowler (1889–1944) in Cambridge. In the postscript
to this letter, Bohr conceded that “there is nothing else to do than to give

140In his detailed critique of the phyics of BKS, Dresden (1987) struggles mightily
to make sense of the “somewhat vague, tenuous relation between the virtual ﬁeld
and the real electromagnetic ﬁeld” (p. 179)
141Stuewer (1975, p. 301) draws attention to a footnote in this paper that makes it
clear that the experiment had been discussed even before Slater’s arrival in Copen-
hagen: “The possibility of such a test was suggested by W. F. G. Swann in conversa-
tion with Bohr and one of us [Compton] in November 1923” (Compton and Simon,
1925, p. 290, note 6). Swann, the reader may recall, had just started in Chicago
that fall, leaving the vacancy in Minnesota that was ﬁlled by Breit and Van Vleck
(see sec. 2.2).

our revolutionary eﬀorts as honourable a funeral as possible” (Stuewer, 1975,
p. 301). His co-authors Kramers and Slater took the fall of BKS harder. So
did other supporters of the theory, such as Ladenburg, Reiche, and Born. By
contrast, Einstein and Pauli, the theory’s most vocal critics, rejoiced. As we
shall see, Born, Pauli, and Van Vleck all explicitly recognized that the demise
of BKS did not aﬀect Kramers’ dispersion theory and its virtual oscillators.

Ladenburg and Reiche had ﬁrst read (the German version of) the BKS paper
(Bohr, Kramers, and Slater, 1924b) in May 1924. “We are pleased,” Laden-
burg wrote to Kramers, “that our considerations harmonize so well with your
ideas.” 142 In the same letter, Ladenburg invited Kramers to come to Breslau
to give a talk and to discuss in person what the two of them and Reiche had
been discussing in correspondence (see sec. 3.4). Kramers accepted the invi-
tation and suggested he talk about the new radiation theory, “which, I hope,
will soon meet with approval from most physicists (although I heard that Ein-
stein has expressed a relatively unfavorable opinion).” 143 Less than a week
later, Kramers received the following intelligence from Ladenburg, directly
addressing his parenthetical remark:

As far as Einstein’s opinion about your new conception of radiation is con-
cerned, I can give you a very precise report, since I attended his talk on May
28 in the Berlin colloquium. His opinion was decidedly not unfavorable. He
declared the new conception to be internally fully consistent and not in di-
rect contradiction with any facts. The mechanism of the undulatory theory
would have to be preserved in his opinion. He put great emphasis, however,
on the conceptual logical diﬃculties of the new theory, of the “preestab-
lished harmony,” which the fundamental introduction of probability instead
of causality brings with it. Speciﬁc objections that he raised seemed to rest
only on a not yet complete knowledge of all your considerations. He pointed
to the asymmetry, for instance, that the production of virtual radiation was
tied to a speciﬁc atomic state. In discussion, I pointed out in response to that
that the virtual oscillators have the frequencies of possible transitions—at
which point he immediately withdrew the objection. 144

Privately, Einstein was less guarded. A month earlier—in a letter to Born
and his wife Hedi (1892–1972) of April 29, 1924—he had already delivered
his oft-quoted put-down that, should BKS turn out to be correct, he “would
rather have been a shoemaker or even an employee in a gambling casino than
a physicist” (Klein, 1970, p. 32). 145 Talking to Kramers in late June, Einstein
expressed himself more diplomatically again. Kramers stopped in Berlin on his

return trip from Breslau, where he had given a well-received talk on BKS on
June 24, 1924. As he reported to Ladenburg once he was back in Copenhagen:
“It was very interesting to hear Einstein’s considerations; as he himself says,
they are all arguments based on intuition.” 146

Ladenburg also attended a colloquium in Berlin in May 1925 in which Bothe
and Geiger presented their results. Ladenburg had just received a copy of the
German edition of Kramers’ popular book with Holst from which we quoted
above. He clearly had a hard time accepting the refutation of BKS at this
point. Referring to the discussion of BKS in ch. 6 of (Kramers and Holst,
1925), he wrote:

In this connection, I must report to you that yesterday Geiger and Bothe
presented their important and beautiful experiments on counting electrons
and [light] quanta in the Compton eﬀect. Apparently, as you know, they have
shown that the emission of electrons and quanta is simultaneous within one-
thousandth of a second or less. Can I ask you to what extent you and Bohr
consider this as standing in contradiction to your theory? Does your theory
really require the complete independence of these two processes, so that
only chance could cause the simultaneous occurrence of the two processes
within one-thousandth of a second? You can imagine how these questions
also aﬀect us and if you have time to write to me to give your opinion I
would be very grateful. 147

Unfortunately, we do not know whether and, if so, how Kramers replied.

When Slater found out about the experimental refutation of the BKS theory,
he sent another letter to Nature (dated July 25, 1925) announcing that he had
once more changed his mind: “The simplest solution to the radiation problem
then seems to be to return to the view of a virtual ﬁeld to guide corpuscular
quanta” (Slater, 1925c). Kramers and Bohr concurred: “we think that Slater’s
original hypothesis contains a good deal of truth.” 148 Slater thus reverted to
the position that, as he reminds the reader, he had been talked out of by Bohr
and Kramers. Slater also noted that Swann had argued for this view during the
December 1924 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, unaware that he, Slater, had been thinking along the same lines. 149
The following year, Bohr mentioned in passing in a letter to Slater that he
had “a bad conscience in persuading you to our view.” Slater told him not to
worry about it. 150

The way in which the BKS paper had come to be written, however, had left
Slater with a bitter taste in his mouth (Schweber, 1990, pp. 350–356). We
already quoted from his letter to Van Vleck of July 27, 1924, in which his
disenchantment with Copenhagen shines through very brightly (see secs. 2.2
and 3.4). Interestingly, on that very same day, Slater wrote to Bohr, thanking
him for his “great kindness and attention to me while I was in Copenhagen.
Even if we did have some disagreements, I felt very well repaid for my time
there, and I look back to it very pleasantly” (Bohr, 1972–1996, Vol. 5, p. 494).
This sounds disingenuous in view of his comments to Van Vleck, but Slater
had also been very positive about Bohr writing to his teacher Bridgman on
February 1, 1924 (Schweber, 1990, p. 354). In his AHQP interview, however,
Slater was very negative about Bohr and his institute. So negative, in fact,
that when he found out that Copenhagen would be one of the depositories for
the AHQP materials, he asked Kuhn to keep the interview out of the copy
going to Denmark. 151

Initially, Slater was angry with both Bohr and Kramers, but his attitude
toward the latter later softened (Dresden, 1987, pp. 168–171). This was prob-
ably under the inﬂuence of his wife, fellow-physicist Rose Mooney (1902–1981)
(Dresden, 1987, pp. 527–528). 152 Before Ms. Mooney became Mrs. Slater in
1948, she had been close to Kramers, whom she had met at a summer school
in Michigan in 1938. The two of them almost certainly had an aﬀair. Kramers
was profoundly unhappy in his marriage to Anna ‘Storm’ Petersen, a Danish
singer he had met in artistic circles in Copenhagen and married in 1920 af-
ter she got pregnant. 153 In one of the most memorable passages of his book,
Dresden (1987, pp. 289–295) reveals that Kramers had told Storm many years
after the fact that he himself had on at least one occasion been railroaded by
Bohr. Kramers apparently thought of the Compton eﬀect around 1920, well
before Compton and Debye did. Bohr, however, detested the notion of light
quanta so much that he worked on Kramers until he recanted. According to
what Storm told Dresden, Kramers had to be hospitalized after one of these

Vol. 5, pp. 68–69).
151Slater to Kuhn, November 22, 1963, included in the folder on Slater in the AHQP.
152A caveat is in order here. As John Stachel (1988) points out in his review of
(Dresden, 1987), “[t]he wealth of intimate detail about Kramers that Dresden pro-
vides relies so heavily on personal interviews (Dresden himself notes the “‘soft’
character” of this information) that it is diﬃcult for others to assess the evidence
until the interviews (which I hope were taped), as well as Kramers’s personal papers,
are made available to others” (p. 745).
153Kramers was on the rebound at the time from the on-again-oﬀ-again relation-
ship with his Dutch girlfriend, Waldi van Eck. Dresden’s description of Kramers’
relationship with van Eck (not to be confused with Van Vleck) conjures up the
image of a virtual oscillator: “no commitments were made, no decisions were taken,
the relationship was never deﬁned, it was certainly never consummated, nor ever
terminated” (Dresden, 1987, p. 525).

63

sessions with Bohr! Bohr’s victory was complete. Even more strongly than
Slater in the case of BKS a few years later, Kramers joined Bohr’s crusade
against light quanta with “all the passion of a repentant convert” (Dresden,
1987, p. 171). Slater may well have found out about this episode from his
wife, Kramers’ former mistress. Whether or not he did, in his autobiography,
as Dresden (1987, p. 528) points out, Slater (1975) refers to his BKS co-author
as “my old friend Kramers” (p. 233).

Born had also been a supporter of BKS. With only Kramers’ Nature notes to
go on, he assumed that Kramers’ dispersion theory was a product of BKS.
He had no way of knowing that Kramers had these results before BKS. By
the time (Born, 1924) was published, however, Born realized that one did not
have to subscribe to all articles of the BKS philosophy to extend the results
of Kramers’ dispersion theory. At the beginning of the paper, Born still writes
as if the two theories stand or fall together:

Recently . . . considerable progress has been made by Bohr, Kramers and
Slater on just this matter of the connection between radiation and atomic
structure . . . How fruitful these ideas are, is also shown by Kramers’ success
in setting up a dispersion formula . . . In this situation, one might consider
whether it would not be possible to extend Kramers’ ideas, which he ap-
plied so successfully to the interaction between radiation ﬁeld and radiating
electron, to the case of the interaction between several electrons of an atom
. . . The present paper is an attempt to carry out this idea (Born, 1924, pp.
181–182).

A footnote appended to this passage reads: “By a happy coincidence I was
able to discuss the contents of this paper with Mr. Niels Bohr, which con-
tributed greatly to a clariﬁcation of the concepts.” Bohr had visited Born
and Heisenberg in G¨ottingen in early June 1924 (Cassidy, 1991, pp. 177–179).
Heisenberg had already told Born all about BKS and Born had expressed his
enthusiasm for the theory in a letter to Bohr of April 16, 1924. 154 Bohr’s visit
must have further solidiﬁed this enthusiasm. A week later, however, Einstein
passed through G¨ottingen and trashed the BKS theory. 155 As a result of Ein-
stein’s onslaught, Born hedged his bets and did not throw in his fate with the
more controversial aspects of BKS (see Mehra and Rechenberg, 1982–2001,
Vol. 2, p. 144; Cassidy, 1991, p. 179). At the beginning of sec. 3 of his paper,
he writes:

it will be proﬁtable to make use of the intuitive ideas, introduced by Bohr,

154See (Bohr, 1972–1996, Vol. 5, p. 299), discussed in (Mehra and Rechenberg,
1982–2001, Vol. 2, p. 143).
155See Heisenberg to Pauli, June 8, 1924 (Pauli, 1979, Doc. 62). This is the same day
that Ladenburg wrote to Kramers that Einstein’s opinion of BKS was “decidedly
not unfavorable” (see above).

64

Kramers and Slater . . . but our line of reasoning will be independent of the
critically important and still disputed conceptual framework of that the-
ory, such as the statistical interpretation of energy and momentum transfer
(Born, 1924, p. 189). 156

Born, however, continued to be a true believer in BKS and took its collapse
harder than Bohr himself. On April 24, 1925, he wrote to Bohr:

Today Franck showed me your letter [of April 21, 1925, the day that Bohr
had received word from Geiger about the results of the Bothe-Geiger exper-
iment] . . . which interested me exceedingly and indeed almost shocked me,
because in it you abandon the radiation theory that obeyed no conservation
laws (Bohr, 1972–1996, Vol. 5, p. 84).

In contrast to Born, Pauli called the demise of BKS “a magniﬁcent stroke of
luck.” 157 Pauli’s opposition to BKS was probably fueled by Einstein, who gave
him an earful about the theory during the annual meeting of the Gesellschaft
Deutscher Naturforscher und ¨Arzte in Innsbruck in September 1924. 158 Pauli
clearly recognized that Kramers’ dispersion theory was independent of BKS
and that the fall of the latter did not aﬀect the former (Darrigol, 1992, p.
244). A footnote in (Pauli, 1925) emphasizes

that the formulas of [Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925] used here are inde-
pendent of the special theoretical interpretation concerning the detailed
description of the radiation phenomena in the quantum theory taken as a
basis by them [i.e., the BKS theory], since these formulas only apply to
averages over a large number of elementary phenomena (Pauli, 1925, p. 5).

As he explained to Kramers, Pauli wanted to distance himself from sugges-
tion in the abstract of (Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925) that “the conclusions,
should they be conﬁrmed, would form an interesting support for this [i.e., the
BKS] interpretation” (cf. sec. 4.1). Alerting Kramers to the footnote quoted
above, Pauli wrote:

if I had not added the footnote in question, it would also have been true that
the conclusions of my paper, if they should be conﬁrmed, ‘would form an

156This illustrates the importance of what Beller (1999) has called the “dialogical
approach” to the history of quantum mechanics (an approach adopted avant la
lettre by Hendry [1984]): to resolve the tension between the two quoted passages in
Born’s paper, it is important to be attuned to the voices of both Bohr and Einstein
in his text.

interesting support for this interpretation.’ This impression I had, of course,
to counteract! 159

This letter was written after Heisenberg’s Umdeutung paper, which was much
more to Pauli’s liking. In the same letter, in cruel Pauli fashion, he proceeded
to berate Kramers for pushing the BKS theory. That this did not aﬀect Pauli’s
appreciation for Kramers’ work on dispersion is clear from what he wrote
to another correspondent a few months after this scathing letter: “[m]any
greetings also to Kramers, whom I am very fond of after all, especially when
I think of his beautiful dispersion formula.” 160

In his NRC Bulletin, written after the Bothe-Geiger and Compton-Simon ex-
periments, Van Vleck, like Pauli, stressed the independence of the Kramers
dispersion theory and BKS. The rejection of the BKS theory and the accep-
tance of the light-quantum hypothesis, he wrote

[do] not mean that Slater’s concept of virtual oscillators is not a useful one.
We may assume that the ﬁelds which guide the light-quants come from a hy-
pothetical set of oscillators rather than from the actual electron orbits of the
conventional electrodynamics. 161 In this way the appearance of the spec-
troscopic rather than the orbital frequency in dispersion can be explained,
and the essential features of the virtual oscillator theory of dispersion . . . can
still be retained. There is an exact conservation of energy between the atoms
and the actual corpuscular light-quants, but only a statistical conservation
of energy between the atoms and the hypothetical virtual ﬁelds (Van Vleck,
1926, pp. 286–287).

Virtual oscillators survived the demise of BKS and happily lived on in the
dispersion theory from which they originated.

These observations by Pauli and Van Vleck make it clear that BKS only played
a limited role in the developments that led to matrix mechanics. It is impor-
tant to keep that in mind. As long as we think of the Kramers dispersion
theory as part and parcel of BKS, it looks as if matrix mechanics replaced
a decisively refuted theory. Once we recognize that the Kramers dispersion
theory was developed before and independently of BKS, we see that matrix
mechanics grew naturally out of an eminently successful earlier theory. The
BKS theory and its refutation by the Bothe-Geiger and Compton-Simon ex-
periments then become a sideshow distracting from the main plot line, which
runs directly from dispersion theory to matrix mechanics. A corollary to this
last observation is that the acceptance of the light-quantum hypothesis was

vocated by Slater during the printing of the present Bulletin. See [Slater, 1925a].”

irrelevant to the development of matrix mechanics. Compton scattering pro-
vided convincing evidence for the light-quantum hypothesis and against the
BKS theory, but it had no bearing on dispersion theory. This is not to deny
that the light-quantum hypothesis indirectly played a role in dispersion the-
ory: the work of Ladenburg, Kramers, and Van Vleck crucially depends on
Einstein’s A and B coeﬃcients, Einstein’s original derivation of which did
involve light quanta.

4.3 Heisenberg, BKS, and virtual oscillators

When Heisenberg ﬁrst read the BKS paper, he was not impressed: “Bohr’s
paper on radiation is certainly very interesting; but I do not really see any
fundamental progress.” 162 He subsequently warmed to the theory, writing to
Copenhagen on April 6, 1924 that he hoped Bohr had meanwhile convinced
Pauli. 163 To Sommerfeld he wrote on November 18, 1924: “Maybe Bohr’s
radiation theory is a most felicitous [sehr gl¨ucklicke] description of this dualism
[i.e., the wave-particle duality of radiation] after all” (Sommerfeld, 2004, p.
174, quoted in Wasserman, 1981, p. 251). Five years later, Heisenberg was
praising BKS eﬀusively:

This investigation represented the real high point in the crisis of quantum
theory, and, although it could not overcome the diﬃculties, it contributed,
more than any other work of that time, to the clariﬁcation of the situa-
tion in quantum theory (Heisenberg, 1929, p. 492; translated and quoted in
Stuewer, 1975, p. 291).

And thirty years later, Heisenberg (1955, p. 12) remembered the BKS theory
as “the ﬁrst serious attempt to resolve the paradoxes of radiation into rational
physics” (quoted in Klein, 1970, p. 37).

Why was Heisenberg so taken with the BKS theory? We already came across
part of the answer. As he told Kuhn in his AHQP interview, Heisenberg saw
in BKS a precursor to the Born interpretation of the Schr¨odinger wave func-
tion (see sec. 4.1). This, we feel, mainly helps explain Heisenberg’s profuse
praise after the fact. In the same interview, however, Heisenberg identiﬁed
another aspect of BKS that can account for his enthusiasm for BKS before
Umdeutung—or rather, Kuhn identiﬁed it for him. What triggered Heisen-
berg’s ruminations on probability in BKS and in the Born interpretation was

162Heisenberg to Pauli, March 4, 1924 (Pauli, 1979, Doc. 57); quoted by Dresden
(1987, p. 202) and Wasserman (1981, p. 250).
163See (Bohr, 1972–1996, Vol. 5, pp. 354–355), cited by Cassidy (1991, p. 176) to
support his claim that “by the end of his March 1924 visit to Copenhagen, Werner
was a convert.”

67

the observation by Kuhn that despite the experimental refutation of the BKS
theory, “a large part of the basic ideas and the whole use of the Correspondence
Principle formulated in terms of virtual oscillators goes on quite unshaken.” 164
Heisenberg’s response does not address this issue at all, whereupon Kuhn tries
again: “In order to do that paper [BKS] one talks not only about . . . probability
. . . but also transforms one’s idea of the atom into a collection of virtual oscil-
lators that operate between states” (ibid., p. 3). This time Heisenberg takes
the bait:

Yes, that was it. This idea, of course, also was there already that an atom
was really a collection of virtual oscillators. Now this . . . was in some way
contrary to the idea of an electron moving around a nucleus. The obvious
connection, the only possible connection, was that the Fourier components
of this motion in some way corresponded, as Bohr said, to the oscillators.
But certainly this paper [BKS] then prepared the way for this later idea
that the assembly of oscillators is nothing but a matrix. For instance, we
can simply say that matrix elements are the collection of oscillators. In this
way, you can say that matrix mechanics was already contained in this paper
[BKS] (ibid., p. 3).

This supports the thesis in (MacKinnon, 1977) mentioned in sec. 4.2 that
matrix mechanics can be seen as a theory of virtual oscillators. What we want
to emphasize is that what initially seems to have attracted Heisenberg to
the BKS theory was the notion of virtual oscillators. Given the origin of this
concept, Heisenberg’s intellectual debt on this point was not to BKS but—
once again (see sec. 3.5)—to dispersion theory. During a subsequent session of
the AHQP interview, Heisenberg, in fact, talks about the link between Fourier
components and oscillators in the context Kramers’ dispersion theory. “When
you say the dispersion formula started from a physical idea,” Kuhn asked, “do
you have a particular thing in mind?” Heisenberg replied:

Well, I would say that his [i.e., Kramers’] idea was that there was the Ein-
stein paper [with the A and B coeﬃcients] and there was the Ladenburg
[1921] paper connected with Einstein’s. On the other hand there was Bohr’s
Correspondence Principle and the idea ﬁnally that this has to do somehow
with Fourier components as oscillators. Kramers had the force to combine
these two possibilities in one simple formula—the dispersion formula. And
this I think was a very important idea that one should combine the Ein-
stein paper, which was very far from the Bohr model[,] with the Bohr model
. . . Behind this idea was already the idea of connecting the oscillators with
the Fourier components, which, as I have said many times, was in the air
somehow in these years. 165

Heisenberg explicitly availed himself of virtual oscillators in (Heisenberg, 1925a),
a paper on the polarization of ﬂuorescent light submitted from Copenhagen
in November 1924 (i.e., before the Kramers-Heisenberg paper). Talking about
this paper in his interview with Kuhn, Heisenberg said:

I would say that all this is part of the game to make the total table of linear
oscillators be the real picture of the atom. One felt that in the Correspon-
dence Principle, one should compare one of these linear oscillators with one
Fourier component of a motion . . . So the whole thing was a program which
one had consciously or unconsciously in one’s mind. That is, how can we
actually replace everywhere the orbits of the electron by the Fourier com-
ponents and thereby get into better touch with what happens? Well, that
was the main idea of quantum mechanics later on. One could see, more
and more clearly, that the reality were the Fourier components and not the
orbits. 166

MacKinnon (1977, pp. 148–155) stresses the importance of (Heisenberg, 1925a)
for the development of matrix mechanics. 167 Heisenberg agreed. Commenting
on a ﬁrst draft of MacKinnon’s article, he wrote to the author in July 1974:
“I was especially glad to see that you noticed how important the paper on
the polarization of ﬂuorescent light has been for my further work on quantum
mechanics. Actually, in Copenhagen I felt that this paper contained the ﬁrst
step in which I could go beyond the views of Bohr and Kramers” (MacKinnon,
1977, p. 149, note 29). As he proudly recounts in his AHQP interview (see
pp. 13–14 of the transcript of session 4), Heisenberg managed to convince
Bohr and Kramers of his approach to this problem, an approach they initially
questioned.

MacKinnon (1977, pp. 157–162) also sees (Heisenberg, 1925b) on the anoma-
lous Zeeman eﬀect as an important step on the way to matrix mechanics:

In the conclusion Heisenberg outlined a new program for quantum theory.
One should use the virtual oscillator model to work out all the Fourier com-
ponents for the electrons in an atom and for the coupling between electrons.
In the rest of this article I will attempt to trace through in detail the way
Heisenberg implemented this program and developed quantum mechanics
(MacKinnon, 1977, pp. 161–162).

Here we part company with MacKinnon. Virtual oscillators are not mentioned
at all in (Heisenberg, 1925b) (though Fourier components are). Heisenberg
(1925b, p. 857) does not even refer to virtual oscillators when discussing results
pertaining to incoherent radiation from (Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925). This
paper, far from being another step toward Umdeutung, seems to be mired in
the intractable problems of the old quantum theory: the Zeeman eﬀect, spin,
and multi-electron atoms.

MacKinnon, in our opinion, thus overstates his case. Yet, even if we discard
what he has to say about (Heisenberg, 1925b) on the Zeeman eﬀect, ample
evidence remains for his claim that “[t]he virtual oscillator model played an es-
sential role in the process of reasoning that led Heisenberg to the development
of quantum mechanics” (MacKinnon, 1977, p. 184). We also want to point out
that the burden of proof for this thesis is not quite as heavy as MacKinnon
makes it out to be. MacKinnon writes: “after this paper [i.e., the Umdeutung
paper] was written the virtual oscillator model sunk from sight and never
resurfaced” (ibid). We already noted that the term “substitute oscillators”
can still be found in the famous post-Umdeutung paper of Born and Jordan
(1925b) (see sec. 3.3). What we did not mention so far is that Land´e (1926,
p. 456) actually introduced the phrase “virtual orchestras” to describe not
BKS but matrix mechanics! 168 The imagery, if not exactly the language, of
an “orchestra of virtual oscillators” was also used in early popular expositions
of matrix mechanics. In a popular book of the 1930s that went through many
editions and was endorsed by Max Planck in a short preface, Ernst Zimmer
wrote: 169

The state of an atom should no longer be described by the unobservable
position and momentum of its electrons, but by the measurable frequencies
and intensities of its spectral lines . . . Regardless of the nature of the real
musicians who play the optical music of the atoms for us, Heisenberg imag-
ines assistant or auxiliary musicians [Hilfsmusiker]: every one plays just one
note at a certain volume. Every one of these musicians is represented by a
mathematical expression, qmn, which contains the volume and the frequency
of the spectral line as in expressions in acoustics familiar to physicists. These
auxiliary musicians are lined up in an orchestra [Kapelle] according to the
initial and ﬁnal states n and m of the transition under consideration. The

168Land´e had worked with Heisenberg in 1924 (Cassidy, 1991, p. 177), resulting in a
joint paper (Land´e and Heisenberg, 1924). In his AHQP interview, Land´e nonethe-
less said that (Heisenberg, 1925c) had been incomprehensible to him and that it had
taken (Born, Heisenberg, and Jordan, 1925) for him to understand matrix mechan-
ics (p. 3 of the transcript of session 5 of the interview; cf. note 11). These comments
seem to be colored, however, by lingering resentment. Land´e felt strongly that Born
should have won the Nobel Prize for his contribution to matrix mechanics and that
German antisemitism was the only reason he had not.

mathematician calls such an arrangement a “matrix” (Zimmer, 1934, pp.
161–162).

Zimmer’s Kapelle der Hilfsmusiker was clearly inspired by Land´e’s Ersatzor-
chester der virtuellen Oszillatoren. Virtual oscillators thus not only survived
the demise of the BKS theory but also the transition to matrix mechanics. In
fact, as we shall see in sec. 7.1, the features captured by the notion of virtual
oscillators can still readily be identiﬁed in the formalism of modern quantum
mechanics. From the point of view of the quantum theory that emerged in the
immediate aftermath of Heisenberg’s Umdeutung paper, in which the atomic
system is quantized but not (as yet) the ambient electromagnetic ﬁeld, both
the virtual oscillators and the virtual radiation 170 of the BKS theory are
related not to the electromagnetic ﬁeld but to the atomic system perturbed
by this ﬁeld. The eﬀect of the perturbation is to induce additional Fourier
components in the Schr¨odinger wave function of the electron. The virtual
oscillators are just these harmonic components. Once the electromagnetic ﬁeld
itself is quantized, it becomes more natural to identify the virtual oscillators
of BKS with the Fourier components of the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld,
which correspond to time-dependent operators creating (or destroying) the
photons emitted (or absorbed) by the atom.

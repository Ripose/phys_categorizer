Summary. — The pioneering work of E.C.G. Stueckelberg is brieﬂy analyzed:
the formalism of the Stueckelberg ﬁeld, able to describe a massive vector ﬁeld,
is reviewed, and some applications are presented. In particular, starting from
his very ﬁrst application, devoted to describe nuclear phenomena known in
the Thirties, later attempts to demonstrate the renormalizability of the model
are considered. Finally, also string theory and LQG are illustrated to be a
suitable scenario for the Stueckelberg ﬁeld.

1. – Biographical notes

Ernst Carl Gerlach Stueckelberg was born in Basel on February 1st, 1905. In 1926, he
got his Ph.D. at Munich under the supervision of Arnold Sommerfeld; then, he qualiﬁed
as a university lecturer at the University of Zurich, till he became Assistant Professor at
Princeton University.
In 1934 he provided the ﬁrst covariant perturbation theory for quantum ﬁelds. To quote
a paper of Lacki et al.[1],

The approach proposed by Stueckelberg was far more powerful, but was not
adopted by others at the time.

Then in 1935, before Yukawa[2] and by a rather diﬀerent approach, he proposed to
explain nuclear interactions as due to the exchange of vector bosons.
Moreover, the evolution parameter theory he presented in 1941 and 1942 is the basis
for recent work in Relativistic dynamics. But his great achievement in 1942 was the

interpretation of the positron as a negative energy electron traveling backward in time.
Feynmamnn quoted this result in one of his classic papers [3].
Stueckelberg died in 1984 in Basel.

2. – The Stueckelberg ﬁeld

Stueckelberg[4, 5] developed the only up to known formulation of a renormalizable

theory for a massive Abelian boson (for a recent review see[6]).
The ﬁrst model for massive vector particles was the Proca one[8] , which simply produces
the extension of the electro-dynamics by the introduction of a mass term; in fact, the
Proca Lagrangian density reads

LP roca = −

F †µν F µν + m2V †µ V µ.

1
2

It is clear that such a term provides a violation of the Abelian gauge symmetry, and, after
several decades, Stueckelberg’s work has been recognized as responsible of the renormal-
izability. After the canonical quantization, one obtains the commutation relations
(2)

[Vµ(x); Vν (y)] = [V †µ (x); V †ν (y)] = 0;

[Vµ(x); V †ν (y)] = −i

ηµν +

∆m(x − y)

m2 ∂µ∂ν

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

where the function ∆m satisﬁes

(∂2 + m2)∆m(x − y) = 0

After 1945, it became clear that the term 1
m2 ∂µ∂ν in the commutation relation (2)
gives rise to ultra-violet divergences, which cannot be eliminated even by the renor-
malization procedure. However, before the development of the renormalization theory,
Stueckelberg[4] provided a divergence-free formulation. In his model, the starting point
is a Fermi-like Lagrangian density for a complex vector ﬁeld Aµ, i.e.

since the Hamiltonian density

LA = −∂µA†ν∂µAν + m2A†µAµ;

HA = −∂µA†ν∂µAν − m2A†µAµ

is not positive deﬁnite, one has to impose the analogue of the Gupta-Bleuler condition
in electro-dynamics, i.e. that the expectation value on physical states of ∂µAµ vanish

< phys′|∂µAµ|phys >= 0

(a suﬃcient condition is ∂µA(
In the Proca case, this condition comes directly from equations of motion.
Unlike QED, relation (6) cannot stand, since, from canonical commutation relations,

)

[Aµ(x); Aν (y)] = [A†µ(x); A†ν (y)] = 0

[Aµ(x); A†ν (y)] = −iηµν∆m(x − y),

E.C.G. STUECKELBERG: A FORERUNNER OF MODERN PHYSICS

one obtains

(8)

(9)

[∂µAµ(x); ∂ν A†ν (y)] = i∂2∆m(x − y) = im∆m(x − y) 6= 0.

Stueckelberg solved this puzzle by introducing a scalar ﬁeld B(x), whose Lagrangian
density reads

LB = ∂µB†∂µB − m2B†B,

with canonical commutation relations

(10)

[B(x); B(y)] = [B†(x); B†(y)] = 0

[B(x); B†(y)] = i∆m(x − y).

Hence, the consistency condition on physical states, such that the Hamiltonian density
is positive deﬁnite, reads as

(11)

S(x)|phys >= (∂µAµ(x) + mB(x))(

)|phys >= 0

−

and one can easily demonstrate no contradiction exists with the commutation relations
(7), (10). Therefore, the full Stueckelberg Lagrangian density is

(12)

LStueck = −∂µA†ν ∂µAν + m2A†µAµ + ∂µB†∂µB − m2B†B

which can be cast in the form

(13)

LStueck = LP roca(W µ) − (∂µA†

µ + mB†)(∂µAµ + mB);

being W µ = Aµ − 1
m ∂µB, it coincides with the Proca Lagrangian density on physical
states. However, there is a main diﬀerence between the two formulations: while the mass
term in LP roca destroys the gauge symmetry, that in LStueck is invariant under Pauli
transformations, i.e.

(14)

Aµ → Aµ + ∂µΛ
B → B + mΛ

(cid:26)

(∂2 + m2)Λ = 0.

A kind of invariance is expected to compensate the introduction of the additional ﬁeld
B and to lower the number of local degrees of freedom to three. In a physical point of
view, we can think of the ﬁeld B(x) as eliminating the scalar term ∂µAµ of the vector
ﬁeld.

3. – The Stueckelberg ﬁeld and the carriers of nuclear interactions

The aim of the paper by E.C.G. Stueckelberg was to describe electromagnetic and “nu-
clear” forces (what we would call electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions) within a
generalization of the formalism developed for charged particles [7]. This formalism deals
with the scalar massive ﬁeld A, which obeys, in presence of matter, the ﬁeld equation

(15)

(∂µ∂µ − l2)A = −4πJ,

advantages of approaching the problem form “gauge” point of view ahead of its time(1).

J and S are functions of the canonical variables p and q, which describe the matter distri-
bution, and obey the (classical) equations of motion ˙p = (i/h)[K, p] and ˙q = (i/h)[K, q].
The quantum theory can be implemented by solving the Schroedinger equation HΨ(t) =
ih ∂Ψ(t)
. To this end, the functional Ψ′(T, t) for the wave function is introduced, such
∂t
that Ψ′(t, t) ≡ Ψ(t), and, accordingly, the functional K(T, t), such that K(t, t) ≡ K (K
does not depend on t explicitly). Since the functional Ψ′ must satisfy simultaneously the

the wave function Ψ is deﬁned by H = W + K. The request that the two Schroedinger
equations be simultaneously solvable leads to the vanishing commutation relation be-
tween the operators deﬁned in (20) and (21), i.e. [CT , Ct] = 0, from which the expression

order to appreciate the development of his pioneering intuitions. In particular, the introduction
of the Stueckelberg ﬁeld will be understood from a historical point of viewed, i.e. via the
Dirac-Fock-Podolski approximation, rather than from a modern perspective, as reviewed in the
previous section.

“current term” Vs, which contains, on its turn, the ﬁeld A: assuming that this term is
proportional to a small number, a series expansion will be performed in order to obtain
the approximated expression for ψ, i.e. ψ = ψ0 + ψ1 + ψ2 + ...:

where the term Usr + Urs is recognized as the ﬁrst order approximation of the “exchange

a “multi-time functional” ψ(t1, ..., ts, ..., tn) can be deﬁned, such that, as previously,
ψ(t, ..., t, ..., t) ≡ ψ(t), so that the Schroedinger equation for the wave functional reads

The generalization of this formalism to a “many-component” ﬁeld [4] (what we would
call a vector ﬁeld) can be accomplished via the substitution of the ﬁeld A with the ﬁeld
i ǫiA∗i Ai,
Ai, i = 0, 1, 2, 3, so that, for example, the scalar product A∗A is replaced by
where ǫ0 ≡ −1, ǫ1,2,3 ≡ 1, and so on. New commutation relations have to be introduced,
such as

P

[A∗

i (x), Aj (y)] = 2ihcǫiδij D(x − y).

In order to have a positive-deﬁnite energy density for the ﬁeld Ai, the new ﬁeld B,
the so-called Stueckelberg ﬁeld, has to be introduced; in fact, the energy density H =

i ǫiH(Ai), where

determine this term is the “Dirac-Fock-Podolski approximation”
ψ = 0, which
can be interpreted as a Gupta-Bleuer condition on the divergence of A: when a mass
term is introduced, and when a vector ﬁeld is taken into account, the approximation

If the same calculation as the case of the scalar ﬁeld is followed, motion equations for
spinors and bosons are obtained. E.C.G. Stueckelberg, in fact, wanted set up a unifying
theory for scattering and decay processes, within the framework of boson “gauge” ﬁelds:
he achieved this task by taking into account the then-known particles and interactions, by
hypothesizing generalized-“charge” conservation, and by predicting, from his calculation,
the existence of new particles and information about their masses [5]. Unfortunately, not
all leptons had already been observed yet, and, consequently, the notion of leptonic and
barionic number, as well as the distinction of weak and strong interactions, had not
already been introduced at that time, but he laid the theoretical foundation of gauge

8

F. CIANFRANI AND O.M. LECIAN

theories. According to the results of the experiments, he classiﬁed the known “spinor”
particles according to their scattering and decay properties by attributing them electric
and “heavy” charges, so that electrons, neutrinos, protons and neutrons are referred to
as e(1, 0), n(0, 0), P (1, 1) and N (0, 1), respectively. As in modern gauge theories, inter-
action between these charges are described by boson ﬁelds, which follow directly from
the eigen-value equations for the generators, so that he predicts four such ﬁelds, that,
according to the interaction they carry, are classiﬁed as e (1, 0), n(0, 0), P (1, 1) and N
(0, 1), respectively. Therefore, the processes mediated by these ﬁelds are

• 1) processes mediated by n(0, 0):

the only processes described by these ﬁelds are of the type

S → S′

+ n(0, 0),

where S can be referred to any kind of spinor. In Stueckelberg’s interpretation,
a better understanding of the proton-proton and neutron-neutron interactions in
atomic nuclei could be achieved by means of the real ﬁeld n(0, 0).

• 2) processes mediated by the ﬁeld e(1, 0):

these processes are β-decays:

together with

P (1, 1) ↔ N (0, 1) + e(1, 0),

e(1, 0) ↔ (−n(0, 0)) + e(1, 0)

describe a nuclear decay, where the notion of anti-particle follows from the mathe-
matics of the model.

• 3) processes mediated by N (0, 1):

the reactions

N (0, 1) ↔ (−n(0, 0)) + N(0, 1),

P (1, 1) ↔ e(1, 0) + N(0, 1)

lead to estimate the mass of the particle N (0, 1): since the proton is a stable
particle, the mass of N (0, 1) must be greater than the diﬀerence of the masses of
the proton and of the electron; furthermore, because of statistics, the mass of the
particle N (0, 1) must be greater than the neutron mass, and it must be an instable
particle, whose decay mode is

• 4) processes mediated by P (1, 1):

N(0, 1) → P (1, 1) + (−e(1, 0)).

P (1, 1) ↔ (−n(0, 0)) + P(1, 1),

so that the mass of the particle P(0, 1) must be greater than the proton mass.
A modern approach to the Electroweak model via the Stueckelberg ﬁeld is proposed in
[6].

4. – The Stueckelberg ﬁeld beyond Stueckelberg

Application of this formalism was at ﬁrst devoted to demonstrate its renormalizabil-
ity. In this sense, Zimmermann[9] started to study Stueckelberg Lagrangian (12), and its
invariance under the Pauli gauge transformations. At the end, the Stueckelberg massive
Abelian model was proved to be renormalizable and unitary by Lowenstein and Schroer
in 1972[10] . We want to stress that this implies that the Stueckelberg model is the only
way to give a mass to an Abelian boson, without a spontaneous symmetry breaking mech-
anism. Therefore, there were several attempts to apply the theory to the non-Abelian
case, in order to to furnish an alternative to the Higgs boson in the Standard Model.
In 1988, Delbourgo, Twisk and Thompson[11] ﬁrst proved that the original Stueckelberg
theory for neutral massive vector ﬁelds is invariant under nilpotent BRST transforma-
tions, which ensures unitarity and renormalizability. Their work clearly illustrated that
the key point, to avoid divergences, is the invariance under Pauli transformations. Then,
they also analyzed the extension to non-Abelian ﬁelds. They noticed that renormaliz-
ability and unitarity seem to be competing qualities of massive non Abelian theories, so
they argued:

“Finally, it must be admitted that the Higgs mechanism remains the most
complete method for giving mass to the vector bosons”.

But extension of the Standard Model, such to contain a Stueckelberg ﬁeld, are again
under investigation[12] .
However, Stueckelberg theory for massive bosons found application also very far from its
natural context.
An example is given by the work of Ramond[13] , who applied the scheme to obtain
the fully covariant and gauge invariant ﬁeld theory for free open bosonic strings in 26
dimensions. In fact, Stueckelberg ﬁelds naturally arise and are shown to be unrestricted
for the most general gauge transformations.
To quote his own words:

“It should be clear that Stueckelberg ﬁeld leads to much simpler looking ex-
pressions”.

Moreover, also very recent attempts to introduce a massive Abelian ﬁeld in Loop Quan-
tum Gravity deal with the Stueckelberg ﬁeld.
Hence, Helesfai[14] stressed how, in such a context, the application of the Stueckelberg
formalism is very useful since no second class constraint arise and the Hamiltonian is a
linear combination of constraints (after quantization, the Proca ﬁeld leads to a Hamilto-
nian that is quadratic in the Lagrange multipliers). In fact, the Hamiltonian reads

H =

The quantization is performed on the Hilbert space

(54)

H = L2( ¯ASU(2), dµSU(2)) ⊗ L2( ¯AU(1), dµU(1)) ⊗ L2( ¯UU(1), dµU(1))

for which a basis is given by the generalized spin network functions

(55)

|S >γ,~j,~ρ,~l, ~m= |T (A) >γ,~j,~ρ ⊗|F (A) >γ,~l ⊗|D(U ) >γ, ~m .

In this context, the mass m is a coupling constant and is very similar to the Immirzi
parameter (in the quantum regime, it enters the Hamiltonian in a non-trivial way).

5. – Brief concluding remarks

Among the brilliant results accomplished by Stueckelberg, the formulation of a divergence-

free model for massive vector ﬁelds has been one of the most proliﬁc ideas in modern
Physics. In fact, despite the Proca formulation, his intuition of the need to maintain a
gauge invariance in the theory has been the key to the later-recognized renormalizability.
Moreover, the modernity of his approach relies on the preference of a gauge symme-
try rather than phenomenological speculations, such as the Yukawa formulation [2], and
renders the Stueckelberg ﬁeld a suitable tool also in current achievements of theoretical
Physics, i.e. String theory and LQG.

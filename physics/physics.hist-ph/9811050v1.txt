Hilbert's paper on (cid:16)The Foundations of Physis (First Communiation),(cid:17)

presented to the Göttingen Aademy of Sienes on November 20, 1915,

is now primarily known for its parallel publiation of essentially the same

gravitational (cid:28)eld equations of general relativity whih Einstein published in

a note on (cid:16)The Field Equations of Gravitation,(cid:17) presented to the Prussian

Aademy of Sienes in Berlin (cid:28)ve days later, on November 25, 1915.

intense orrespondene between Hilbert and Einstein in the ruial month of

November 1915, furthermore, onfronts the historian with a ase of parallel

researh and with the assoiated problem of reonstruting the interation

between Hilbert and Einstein at that time.

Previous assessments of these issues have reently been hallenged by Leo

Corry, Jürgen Renn, and John Stahel who draw attention to a hitherto un-

notied (cid:28)rst set of proofs for Hilbert's note.

These proofs bear a printer's

stamp of Deember 6 and display substantial di(cid:27)erenes to the published

version, in partiular as regards the ovariane of the theory and the disus-

of Einstein's gravitational (cid:28)eld equations in terms of the Rii tensor and its

trae, the Riemann urvature salar.

By foussing on the onsequenes of these (cid:28)ndings for the reonstrution

of Einstein's path towards general relativity (cid:22) any possibility that Einstein

took the lue for the (cid:28)nal step towards his (cid:28)eld equations from Hilbert's note

is now de(cid:28)nitely preluded (cid:22) a number of questions about Hilbert's role in

the episode, however, are left open. To what extent did Hilbert reat to

Einstein? What were Hilbert's researh onerns in his note, and how did

they ome to overlap with Einstein's to some extent in the fall of 1915? How

did Hilbert and Einstein regard eah other and their onurrent ativities

at the time? What did Hilbert hope to ahieve, and what, after all, did he

ahieve?

4

spetive.

With these questions in mind I shall disuss in this paper Hilbert's (cid:28)rst

note on the (cid:16)Foundations of Physis,(cid:17) its prehistory and harateristi fea-

tures,

and, for heuristi purposes, I shall do so largely from Hilbert's per-

1 Hilbert and his researh program

In ontrast to Einstein's biography, Hilbert's life was uriously una(cid:27)eted by

the drasti historial hanges assoiated with Germany's transition from the

Kaiserreih to Weimar demoray to the Nazi regime, or, for that matter,

by the (cid:28)rst World War. Hilbert ame to Göttingen in 1895, aged 33, as a

young professor, and there he stayed for nearly (cid:28)fty years. In Göttingen he

lived almost all these years in the same house on Wilhelm-Weber-Straÿe 29,

married to the same woman, and leading a sholarly life devoted to mathe-

matial researh and aademi teahing. Hilbert never had a sabbatial, but

he gave leture ourses, term after term, on various (cid:28)elds of mathematis,

logi, and mathematial physis. These letures are doumented by more

than a hundred Vorlesungsausarbeitungen kept in the Mathematis Institute

4

For the sake of ompleteness, it should be noted that, in 1924, Hilbert published a

revised version of his (cid:28)rst note as the (cid:28)rst part of a paper, titled also (cid:16)Die Grundlagen der

Physik(cid:17) in the Mathematishe Annalen ([Hilbert 1924℄). The seond part of this 1924 note

was his seond note on the (cid:16)Foundations of Physis(cid:17) from Deember 1916 ([Hilbert 1917℄),

revised in 1924 as well. A disussion of this 1924 republiation of his (cid:28)rst note is beyond

the sope of the present paper. It would involve a disussion of Hilbert's subsequent work

leading to the publiation of his seond note, of later investigations of the energy problem

by Felix Klein and others, as well as of developments in uni(cid:28)ed (cid:28)eld theory up to 1924.

of Göttingen University. In spring and fall, between terms, however, he used

to leave Göttingen to spend vaations either on the Balti or in the Swiss

mountains.

5

Intelletually, on the other hand, Hilbert's ahievements have been alled

revolutionary, in partiular as regards his work on the foundations of math-

ematis. And it would be wrong to assume that Hilbert stewed in his own

juie in Göttingen. He did partiipate energetially in the sienti(cid:28) disus-

sions of the day, and he also took ative part in matters of sienti(cid:28) interest

to the small but vital sienti(cid:28) ommunity of Göttingen. It has often been

said that the people of Göttingen in the era of Klein and Hilbert saw the

town as one of the enters, if not as the enter, of the sienti(cid:28) world.

Be

6

that as it may, Hilbert's ative intervention in matters of siene poliy aimed

at having ruial people ome to Göttingen. Leading sientists who worked

reatively at the edge of urrent researh in a (cid:28)eld that was of interest to

Göttingen mathematiians were invited to ome there and inform Hilbert

and his olleagues about the latest developments in the (cid:28)eld.

A typial example is provided by Hilbert's (cid:28)rst orrespondene with Ein-

stein.

In 1912 Hilbert was working on impliations of his theory of linear

7

integral equations for physis, in partiular the kineti theory of gases and

radiation theory. This was a (cid:28)eld where Einstein had published important

ontributions. So Hilbert sent Einstein a postard asking for o(cid:27)prints of his

papers. Some time later he sent Einstein a opy of his just published book on

integral equations, and then invited him to ome to Göttingen in the spring

of the following year to attend a Wolfskehl symposium on the kineti theory

of matter. Einstein delined, saying he had nothing new to say and that he

was also too busy.

Intelletually, Hilbert's siene poliy is mathed by a harateristi fea-

ture of his perspetive on the mathematial sienes aptured by the ath-

word (cid:16)the axiomati method.(cid:17) The axiomati method is harateristially

re(cid:29)etive; it takes up whatever insight has been ahieved into a (cid:28)eld and

tries to analyse, larify and reformulate it. But it is not a vague, unspei(cid:28)

openness towards anything new in the sienes. In physis, too, Hilbert had

rather (cid:28)rm judgments about important developments and the role he himself

and his group might play in them.

Hilbert's (cid:28)rst note on the Foundations of Physis from 1915 indeed rep-

resents the ulmination of a lifelong interest and many years of ative work

in physis.

I would like to suggest that there are some harateristis of his

8

understanding of physis whih date to his early years and stay relatively

invariant over the years.

1.1 Physis as a mathematial disipline

Hilbert's view of physis from a mathematiian's perspetive beomes quite

expliit in remarks he made regarding the relationship between physis and

geometry. Hilbert regarded geometry as a genuine branh of mathemat-

is. But, originally, geometry was a natural siene. Only it was no longer

sub jet to experimental examination and had beome mathematized, arith-

metized and eventually axiomatized. For Hilbert, this development is not

only an aount of the fatual historial development but also of the proper

advanement of siene, an advanement whih should be furthered wherever

possible.

in Königsberg, Hilbert wrote

Thus, as early as 1894, in a leture on geometry whih he gave while still

Geometry is a siene whih essentially has developed to suh a

state that all its fats may be derived by logial dedution from

previous ones.

9

And he immediately adds

Completely di(cid:27)erent from, e.g. eletriity theory or optis where

even today new fats are still being disovered.

10

Later in this leture, in the ourse of disussing the axiomati foundations of

geometry, he presents the axiom of parallels and disusses the alternatives of

Eulidean, hyperboli and paraboli geometries. In this ontext he remarks

können.(cid:17) SUB Cod. Ms. Hilbert 541, p. 7.

of geometry, (cid:28)rst of all mehanis, but then also optis and ele-

11

This is 1894. Very similar remarks are made in a leture ourse on Eulidean

geometry given in winter 1898/99. There Hilbert haraterizes geometry as

a natural siene but of suh a kind that its theory may be alled

a perfeted one whih, as it were, provides a model for the theo-

retial treatment of other natural sienes.

12

In the same semester Hilbert also letured on mehanis. This is in fat

Hilbert's (cid:28)rst leture ourse dealing with physis proper.

In the introdu-

13

tion to this ourse, Hilbert again haraterized geometry as a mathematial

siene whih used to be a natural siene. Regarding mehanis he then

goes on:

Also in mehanis the basi fats are aepted by all physiists.

But the arrangement of the basi onepts nevertheless is sub jet

to the hanges in viewpoint. The struture is also far more om-

pliated [than that of geometry℄; even deiding what is simpler

is something whih depends on further disoveries. Hene, even

today, mehanis annot yet be alled a purely mathematial dis-

ipline, at least not to the extent that geometry is.

1.2 Physis and the axiomati method

The letures on Eulidean geometry and mehanis given in winter 1898/99

from whih these quotes are taken immediately preeded the writing of

Hilbert's famous and lassi (cid:16)Foundations of Geometry(cid:17) published in June

1899 as part of a Festshrift on the oasion of the unveiling of the Gauss-

Weber-monument in Göttingen.

Hilbert's axiomati treatment of geometry

16

as laid out in the Festshrift was immensely in(cid:29)uential in the emergene of

what is alled the axiomati method in mathematis, aptured roughly by

the postulates of independene, onsisteny, and ompleteness for systems of

axioms, by the notion of impliit de(cid:28)nition, and by the use of models in the

logial analysis of axiomati systems.

Hilbert's work in geometry was also in(cid:29)uential for his own understanding

of mathematis and physis. The quotes given above illustrate that Hilbert

saw his axiomati reformulation of Eulidean geometry as a model of the

way in whih physis was to be treated as well. For a proper understanding

of Hilbert's subsequent work in physis some brief omments on the most

expliit early programmati formulation for this work are in order: the sixth

of the 23 problems for future mathematial researh whih Hilbert formu-

lated for the International Congress of Mathematiians in Paris in 1900, i.e.,

roughly a year after the Festshrift. This sixth problem expliitly reads

6. Mathematial Treatment of the Axioms of Physis. The in-

vestigations on the foundations of geometry suggest the problem:

To treat in the same manner, by means of axioms, those physial

sienes in whih already today mathematis plays an important

part; in the (cid:28)rst rank are the theory of probabilities and mehan-

17

is.

15

16

17

(cid:16)Wir müssen streben, dass sie es wird. Wir müssen die Grenzen ehter Mathematik

immer weiter ziehen niht nur in unserem mathematishen Interesse, sondern im Interesse

der Wissenshaft überhaupt.(cid:17) ibid.

[Hilbert 1899℄. The other part of this Festshrift was a disussion by Emil Wiehert

of the (cid:16)Foundations of Eletrodynamis(cid:17) ([Wiehert 1899℄).

(cid:16)6. Mathematishe Behandlung der Axiome der Physik. Durh die Untersuhungen

6

The formulation of the sixth problem might suggest that Hilbert rather

spei(cid:28)ally had in mind just the kind of logial analysis of basi assump-

tions, derived theorems, and their mutual interdependene whih led to the

axiomati understanding of Eulidean geometry. His notes on mehanis

show, indeed, that Hilbert foussed on suh logial elements, for instane

when he expliitly noted from the literature that not only do Kepler's laws

follow from Newton's law, but that some onverse assertion is also true.

Namely, that if in the (cid:28)eld of a entral fore all motions are oni setions or,

alternatively, all bounded motions are losed, the fore an only be the New-

tonian 1/r2

or the harmoni fore ∝

r . Hene, to some extent, Newton's law

onversely follows from Kepler's (cid:28)rst law plus some additional assumptions.

18

19

Another suh example is taken from Boltzmann's mehanis from 1897.

There Boltzmann ompares Gauss's dynamial priniple of least ation to

the priniple of virtual displaements by looking at the motion of a material

point onstrained to the onvex side of a paraboli surfae. While Gauss's

priniple allows the determination of the onditions when the point leaves

the surfae, the priniple of virtual displaements fails to do so. In the latter

ase, additional assumptions have to be made.

These examples might suggest that Hilbert, in 1900, quite spei(cid:28)ally had

in mind a re(cid:29)etion on the reeived knowledge of lassial point mehanis

aiming at the identi(cid:28)ation of possible preise formulations of its dynami-

al priniples and their derivable onsequenes. There is, however, another

dimension to Hilbert's program for the axiomati understanding of physis.

Hilbert, indeed, gives some further explanation of what he had in mind. He

mentions a number of (cid:16)important investigations by physiists on the founda-

tions of mehanis,(cid:17) namely the writings by Mah, Hertz, Boltzmann, and

Volkmann.

Hilbert had studied Boltzmann's mehanis quite losely. He

20

wrote:

It is therefore very desirable that the disussion of the foundations

über die Grundlagen der Geometrie wird uns die Aufgabe nahegelegt, nah diesem Vor-

bilde diejenigen physikalishen Disziplinen axiomatish zu behandeln, in denen shon heute

die Mathematik eine hervorragende Rol le spielt: dies sind in erster Linie die Wahrshein-

lihkeitsrehnung und die Mehanik.(cid:17) [Hilbert 1900, p. 272℄, translation, slightly adapted,

of mehanis be taken up by mathematiians also. Thus Boltz-

mann's work on the priniples of mehanis suggests the problem

of developing mathematially the limiting proesses, there merely

indiated, whih lead from the atomisti view to the laws of mo-

tion of ontinua. Conversely one might try to derive the laws of

the motion of rigid bodies by a limiting proess from a system of

axioms depending upon the idea of ontinuously varying ondi-

tions of a material (cid:28)lling all spae ontinuously, these onditions

being de(cid:28)ned by parameters. For the question as to the equiva-

lene of di(cid:27)erent systems of axioms is always of great theoretial

interest.

21

The spei(cid:28)ation of the vague term (cid:16)mathematial treatment(cid:17) or (cid:16)axiomati

treatment(cid:17) is given here by referring to the problem of a preise and rigorous

mathematial formulation of the transition between disrete, atomisti on-

eptions and ontinuum mehanis. The important point is Hilbert's onern

with a proper mathematial formulation of ontinuum mehanis.

In his early letures, Hilbert always introdued a tripartite division of

mehanis: the mehanis of a single mass point, the mehanis of systems

of a (cid:28)nite number of mass points, and the mehanis of in(cid:28)nitely many mass

points.

In Hilbert's understanding, the third part in itself was divided

22

into ontinuum mehanis whih did not only omprise elastiity theory and

hydrodynamis but also the investigation of the motion of those (cid:29)uids whih

(cid:16)do not have all the properties of matter,(cid:17) suh as eletri and magneti (cid:29)uids,

ether, and the motion of energy and entropy. The mehanis of in(cid:28)nitely

many mass points, on the other hand, also inluded moleular physis, kineti

theory, the theory of ions and eletrons as well as hemistry in general.

The mehanis of in(cid:28)nitely many mass points (be it in its ontinuum

version or in its disrete, atomisti version), in any ase, omprises all of

physis. The sixth problem, therefore, in some sense simply formulates the

task of mathematizing physis and of making it just one more branh of

Put this way, the Paris problem may seem preposterously ambitious. Not

neessarily so for Hilbert. He had solved some longstanding mathematial

problems by bringing together hitherto unrelated branhes of mathematis.

His proof of the (cid:28)nite basis theorem had put an abrupt end to deades of

ative mathematial researh in invariant theory by solving a entral problem

on a higher level of abstration, and a similar breakthrough was ahieved by

his monumental Zahlberiht whih systematized and summarized nineteenth-

entury knowledge in number theory.

And, in the onluding passage of

25

his Paris leture, Hilbert expliitly expressed a (cid:28)rm belief in the unity of the

mathematial sienes.

Mathematial siene is in my opinion an indivisible whole, an

organism whose vitality is onditioned upon the onnetion of its

parts. For with all the variety of mathematial knowledge, we

are still learly onsious of the similarity of the logial devies,

the relationship of the ideas in mathematis as a whole and the

numerous analogies in its di(cid:27)erent departments.

for systematially distinguishing systems of axioms for physis.

He also

Hilbert, at that time, was a well-known if not yet world-famous mathemati-

ian. In his (cid:28)ve years as professor in Göttingen Hilbert had already had a

(cid:28)rst oasion to deline a all to the university of Leipzig. Another suh oa-

sion soon followed when Hilbert was o(cid:27)ered the prestigious hair of Lazarus

Fuhs at Berlin University.

Again he delined, but he sueeded in onvin-

whih would allow him to get Minkowski to ome to Göttingen. His plan

worked and Minkowski ame in 1902; and this is also the time, biographi-

ally, when Hilbert again started to work on physis. He begins with a two-

semester ourse on ontinuum mehanis. In the following semester Hilbert

and Minkowski also gave a joint seminar on the general problem of the me-

hanial stability of ontinuous systems. In this ontext, Hilbert also started

to do researh, as witnessed by a talk to the Naturforsherversammlung in

Kassel in 1903. The talk was (cid:16)On Mehanis of Continua(cid:17) and dealt with

the problem of the mehanial stability of a liquid in a vessel.

32

2.1 The period 1902(cid:21)1915

Notwithstanding Hilbert's early researh work on ontinuum mehanis, and

notwithstanding a series of leture ourses and joint seminars on the mathe-

matial problems of mehanis, eletromagnetism and other (cid:28)elds of physis,

Göttingen mathematial physis, as far as Hilbert was onerned, was a task

pursued predominantly by Minkowski. Hilbert in these years was working on

his theory of integral equations. After all, the axiomatization of physis was

just one problem among 22 others on his list.

At that time, Göttingen was a stronghold of the so-alled eletromagneti

world view.

In 1902 and 1903, the Göttingen theoretiian Max Abraham

33

had published programmati papers on the dynamis of the eletron.

He

34

had shown that the inertial mass of the eletron may ompletely be aounted

for on the basis of Maxwellian eletromagnetism.

Assuming that the eletron is a small rigid sphere with uniform harge

distribution, Abraham had omputed the work to be done in hanging the

energy and momentum of the eletron's self-(cid:28)eld when it is aelerated by

an external (cid:28)eld. Given that the eletron was regarded as the ultimate on-

stituent of matter Abraham's result opened up the perspetive of a om-

plete reinterpretation of the onepts of Newtonian mehanis in terms of

SUB Cod. Ms. Hilbert 593. The problem of the talk was how to ontrol mathematially

the in(cid:28)nitely many degrees of freedom if you investigate the stability of the liquid by

looking at small deviations of its enter of mass from its equilibrium position given that

neither the shape of the surfae nor its boundary onditions are (cid:28)xed.

See [Jungnikel and MCormah 1986℄, pp. 227(cid:21)245, for a disussion of the eletro-

magneti worldview in the setting of Germany's theoretial physis at the turn of the

32

entury.

Maxwellian eletrodynamis and the foundation of physis on the basis of

Maxwell's eletromagneti (cid:28)eld theory. Moreover, in doing the alulations,

Abraham had obtained an expression for the inertial mass of the eletron

whih turned out to depend on the eletron's veloity. And these results

seemed to be in good agreement with experimental data obtained by the Göt-

tingen experimental physiist Kaufmann on beta and athode rays.

This

35

on(cid:28)rmation of Abraham's theory was (cid:16)ertainly one of the most important

results of modern physis,(cid:17) as Lorentz observed in 1909.

36

Minkowski's subsequent role in the disussions of urrent theoretial prob-

lems in eletrodynamis and his work on speial relativity and four-dimensional

eletrodynamis

may have helped to e(cid:27)et a reorientation of Hilbert's global

37

perspetive on physis. Hilbert, too, gradually hanged from his predominant

onern with a mathematially sound formulation of ontinuum mehanis

to an eletromagneti world view, whih assigned some ruial importane

to the theoretial understanding of the eletron.

After Minkowski's death

38

39

and Born's work on the rigid body problem in speial relativity,

it was two

of Hilbert's students, Erih Heke and Wilhelm Behrens, who ontinued to

work out details of speial-relativisti eletron dynamis on the basis of the

Abraham-Born theory of the rigid spherial eletron.

40

During this time, however, Hilbert himself worked predominantly on

mathematial problems, a ma jor one being his theory of linear integral equa-

tions. A deisive turn in Hilbert's researh interests ourred in 1912, when

he had just (cid:28)nished a ma jor monograph on this sub jet, summarizing the

results and fruits of his researh of the previous eight years in a systemati

exposition.

Working on the (cid:28)nal hapters of his book, he onsidered appli-

41

ations of his theory for physis and disovered that it may provide a means

of larifying the foundations of kineti gas theory, and shortly later found

that it also ould be applied to radiation theory. These insights alled his

old dreams of mathematizing physis to life again. From now on, Hilbert

devoted his time during the next few years almost exlusively to mathemat-

ial physis and after more than three years, in the fall of November 1915

his e(cid:27)orts promised to result in a ma jor breakthrough, perhaps ompara-

ble to his ahievements in invariant theory or geometry: he realized that

a novel eletromagneti theory of the eletron put forward in 1912 by the

Greifswald physiist Gustav Mie ould be inorporated into the same math-

ematial framework as another ompletely novel theory of the gravitational

(cid:28)eld published just reently by the young and rather reative theoretiian

Albert Einstein. This would give Hilbert the hane of putting forward a

uni(cid:28)ed mathematial desription of both the gravitational and eletromag-

neti (cid:28)elds and, at the same time, a framework to ompute the dynamis of

the eletron and possibly to explain the quantum features of the Bohr atom.

Hilbert's and Klein's siene poliy of systematially aquainting them-

selves and their fellow Göttingen mathematiians with the most reent re-

searh had paid o(cid:27) handsomely. Mie's theory was published in three install-

ments in 1912.

But even before the last ommuniation was issued, Max

42

Born gave a report on this theory to the Göttingen mathematial soiety.

43

Born himself ontinued to work on Mie's theory, reinterpreting it in terms of

Minkowski's four-dimensional formulation and working out formal relations

to speial-relativisti elastiity theory. He gave another talk on Mie's theory

and on some of his own work a year later in late 1913.

At that time, a

44

report on Einstein's and Grossmann's just reently published Entwurf einer

veral lgemeinerten Relativitätstheorie und einer Theorie der Gravitation was

given as well.

Einstein's theory with its strange mathematial intriaies

45

must have indued Hilbert to try again to invite Einstein to Göttingen to

learn about this theory at (cid:28)rst hand. In summer 1915 he sueeded, and in

the (cid:28)rst week of July Einstein gave a ourse of six Wolfskehl letures on his

Born's report (cid:16)on the works by Mie on the theory of matter(cid:17) was given on Deember

17 (JDM 22 (1913), p. 27), [Mie 1913℄ was issued on Deember 31, 1912.

Born gave a report on (cid:16)Mie's theory of matter(cid:17) to the Göttingen Mathematial Soiety

on November 25, and letured on some of his own work, (cid:16)arried out in onnetion with

Mie's theory of matter,(cid:17) on Deember 16 (JDM 22 (1913), p. 207).

[Born 1914℄ was

presented to the Göttingen Aademy by Hilbert on Deember 20, 1913. Hilbert had also

At the end of the summer term,

Hilbert was left with a number of rather interesting but intriate papers on

mathematial physis whih alled for ompetent mathematial analysis. He

would soon (cid:28)nd not only exiting analogies and onnetions between those

two theories but also pinpoint (cid:29)aws in Einstein's rather pedestrian way of

dealing with the mathematis of his gravitation theory.

2.2 Mid-July to Mid-November 1915

Unfortunately, very little is known about Hilbert's whereabouts and intelle-

tual preoupations in the late summer and fall of 1915 after Einstein's visit.

One of the last douments from this summer is a letter to Shwarzshild,

dated 17 July. In this letter Hilbert wrote

We had a lot of sienti(cid:28) business here during the two war semesters.

Almost all mathematis and physis leturers inl. Voigt and

Tammann partiipate in my seminar; the main instigator is, of

ourse, Debye. During the summer we had as guests one after the

other: Sommerfeld, Born, Einstein. In partiular, the letures of

the latter on gravitation theory were memorable.

48

Four days later, a meeting in preparation for Emmy Noether's habilitation

was held in Göttingen, and it is known that Hilbert, the most fervent propo-

GM 1916, p. 13. Leo Corry (cid:28)rst found notes on a part of Einstein's letures taken by

an unknown auditor and preserved in the Hilbert arhives (SUB Cod. Ms. Hilbert 724).

These notes have meanwhile been published as Appendix B to CPAE6, pp. 586(cid:21)590. On

June 29, 1915, Einstein letured (cid:16)on gravitation(cid:17) at the Göttingen Mathematial Soiety

(JDM 24 (1915), p. 68).

Hilbert's presene

49

was also needed sine the a(cid:27)air was more than routine aademi business.

It would set a preedent and implied breaking a deree issued in 1908 by

the Prussian ministry against the habilitation of women at Prussian univer-

sities.

After this July meeting it is not known what Hilbert did or where

50

he was.

Then there is a postard from Hilbert's student Rihard Bär who later

worked out Hilbert's relativity letures, dated August 17, 1915.

Bär had

visited Hilbert in Switzerland and the two sent greetings to Hilbert's wife

who had remained in Göttingen.

Six years later, Felix Klein reports in a letter to Pauli that Hilbert had the

deisive insight ((cid:16)die entsheidende Gedankenwendung(cid:17)) in the fall of 1915 in

Rügen, and adds that Sommerfeld should know more about this.

Klein's

reolletion is orroborated by a letter from Erih Heke to Hilbert, dated 16

Otober, in whih he thanks him for a postard (cid:16)von Rügen aus.(cid:17)

While it

51

52

53

is thus probable that Hilbert did spend some time during the fall of 1915 on

Rügen, we don't know exatly when.

54

The next thing we know about Hilbert is that he spent a week in Munih

in mid-Otober. On his way bak, he met Shwarzshild's mother in the

train, and took the oasion to write a postard to Shwarzshild, dated

Ot. 23:

Dear S[hwarzshild℄.

Just as we were oming bak from an eight-day visit to Munih

we met your mother in the train.(cid:22)During the summer semester

we had many sienti(cid:28) guests in Göttingen, among them also

habilitation with extensive quotes of the extant arhival douments.

As it turned out this (cid:28)rst attempt eventually failed. Emmy Noether's habilitation

was only ahieved in Göttingen in 1919 after the end of the war and after the German

November revolution, see [Tollmien 1991℄.

The question may be relevant beause Einstein also spent a ouple of weeks in Rügen

in the seond half of July, i.e., after he gave his talks in Göttingen. There is hene a

slight hane that Hilbert was in Rügen at the same time as Einstein and that the two

ontinued their disussion there. However, as far as I know there is no further indiation

in the orrespondene that would orroborate this surmise.

Einstein, [whih℄ was highly interesting. The (cid:16)astronomial(cid:17) Fre-

undlih was with us as well. The astronomers, I think, must now

leave everything else aside and only try to verify or refute Ein-

stein's gravitation law!

Yours sinerely.

55

With his return to Göttingen, a rather busy time began for Hilbert with

the daily routine of the winter term. A (cid:28)rst Aademy meeting whih always

took plae on Saturdays was held on Otober 23.

Then he had to give his

56

letures: Mondays he letured for two hours on di(cid:27)erential equations and

gave a two-hour seminar on the struture of matter in the afternoon together

with Debye.

On Monday evenings he attended the physis olloquium.

57

58

Tuesdays meetings of the Göttingen Mathematial Soiety were held.

On

59

Thursday mornings another two hours of letures on di(cid:27)erential equations

were sheduled, and in the afternoon there were the weekly hikes of Hilbert,

Klein and Runge where siene poliy matters had to be disussed.

On the following Friday, Otober 29, a ommission meeting onern-

ing the habilitation of Emmy Noether took plae. Another meeting of the

Mathematis-Physis Department was sheduled for the following week, on

Saturday, November 6. On Tuesday, November 9, Emmy Noether gave a talk

Despite all these matters to be seen of, Hilbert still tried to work out the

impliations of his (cid:16)entsheidende Gedankenwendung,(cid:17) as Klein had alled

it, implying generally ovariant (cid:28)eld equations for the gravitational and for

the eletromagneti (cid:28)elds, some mathematial relations between these (cid:28)eld

equations, a disussion of the energy theorem in this framework, and the

prospet of (cid:28)nding a solution to the non-linear generalized Maxwell equa-

tions that would orretly desribe the eletron. However, on the previous

weekend Hilbert had reeived an alarming letter from Einstein, who had sent

him the proofs of his (cid:28)rst November ommuniation,

whih introdued

64

63

Einstein's return to general ovariane

and also presented a modi(cid:28)ed set of

gravitational (cid:28)eld equations that, however, were not yet generally ovariant.

Einstein wrote:

With the same mail I am sending you the proofs of a paper in

whih I modi(cid:28)ed the gravitation equations after I myself had

realized some four weeks ago that my former proof was (cid:29)awed.

Colleague Sommerfeld wrote to me that you also found a hair in

my soup whih made it unpalatable to you. I am urious whether

you will ome to like this new solution.

65

Hilbert responded with a friendly letter, now lost. But matters got worse

on the following weekend when he reeived a seond letter from Einstein

66

in whih Einstein reported further progress on ahieving general ovariane

in his theory of gravitation.

In his seond ommuniation to the Berlin

Aademy,

Einstein now had published generally ovariant (cid:28)eld equations

momentum tensor.

In his letter Einstein alluded to this onsequene by

pointing out that, by this hypothesis, gravitation must play a fundamental

role in the onstitution of matter.

But this touhed on what Hilbert saw as his own original insight. Alarmed,

Hilbert deided to take ation. He announed a leture on the (cid:16)fundamen-

tal equations of physis(cid:17) in the Göttingen Mathematial Soiety where he

wanted to present his own reent investigations.

He alled Emmy Noether

for assistane. She wrote to Fisher in Erlangen

Invariant theory here is now trump; even [Paul℄ Hertz, the physi-

ist, studies Gordan-Kershensteiner; Hilbert wants to talk next

week about his Einsteinian di(cid:27)erential invariants, and so the Göt-

tingers must get up to speed.

69

And on Saturday, November 13, he sent two postards to Einstein asking him

to ome to his leture on the following Tuesday, November 16, or better still to

the physis olloquium on Monday evening, inviting him to stay at Hilbert's

house.

Einstein delined.

He was, in fat, just then working out what

70

71

proved to be perhaps his greatest breakthrough, the orret omputation of

the perihelion advane of Merury on the basis of his new (cid:28)eld equations.

So Hilbert had to report his (cid:28)ndings in orrespondene to Einstein, un-

fortunately lost. He probably sent Einstein the manusript of his leture to

the Göttingen Mathematial Soiety, or a summary of its main points.

But

72

he realized that he did not have any more time to arefully work out the

In his letter of November 18, Einstein responded to this lost piee of orrespondene,

that, as far as Einstein ould tell, Hilbert's system was equivalent to the one he, Einstein,

had found in the preeding weeks and presented to the Berlin Aademy (Einstein to

Hilbert, 18 November 1915, CPAE8, Do. 148).

onsequenes of his own theory as he had hoped to do, in partiular that he

would not sueed in obtaining a solution to the eletron problem in time.

The next oasion for presenting a ommuniation to the Göttingen Aademy

was Saturday, November 20, but Hilbert had already sent his manusript on

the (cid:16)fundamental equations of physis(cid:17) to the printer a day ahead, on Novem-

ber 19, a rather unusual irregularity in the Aademy's proeedings.

And he

must have been glad he did, sine on that day he reeived notie from Ein-

73

74

stein that he had sueeded in alulating the orret perihelion advane.

To that Hilbert ould only respond with a (cid:16)herzlihe Gratulation,(cid:17) and the

remark

If I ould do the alulations as rapidly as you, the eletron would

have to surrender and the hydrogen atom would have to produe

a letter from home exusing it from not radiating.

3 The proofs and the published paper

Hilbert's note was published under the title (cid:16)The Foundations of Physis

(First Communiation)(cid:17) in the last issue of the 1915 volume of the Nahrihten

The invitation for the meeting of 20 November was issued on November 15 and was,

as always, irulated among the members to on(cid:28)rm their partiipation and announe

any ommuniations they intended to present at the meeting. Into this invitation, Hilbert

wrote: (cid:16)Hilbert legt vor in die Nahrihten: Grundgleihungen der Physik.(cid:17) (GAA Chron

2.1, Vol. 6, 411). For eah ommuniation to the (cid:16)Nahrihten(cid:17), the (cid:16)Journal für die

`Nahrihten' der Gesellshaft der Wissenshaften in Göttingen,(cid:17) (GAA Sient 66, Nr. 2),

lists author and title of the paper, the member of the Aademy who presented it for publia-

period overed by the (cid:16)Journal(cid:17), 1912(cid:21)1935, there were eight items out of several hundred

whih were given to the printer before being presented to the Aademy.

As mentioned above, attention has

76

77

reently been drawn to a (cid:28)rst set of proofs for this note.

This (cid:28)rst set

bears a printer's stamp of Deember 6 and displays substantial di(cid:27)erenes

from the published version, in partiular with regard to the disussion of the

onept of energy and the ovariane of the theory. In ontrast to standard

aounts of the history of General Relativity it was pointed out that, in this

(cid:28)rst version, Hilbert still believed in Einstein's argument for the neessity of

distinguishing between what Hilbert alled world parameters and spae-time

oordinates, i.e., the neessity of introduing the so-alled adapted oordinate

systems of Einstein's Entwurf theory, whih restrit the general ovariane

of the theory. Corry, Renn, and Stahel, in partiular, emphasize the fat

that the proofs do not yet ontain the expliit form of the gravitational (cid:28)eld

equations in terms of the Rii tensor and the Riemann urvature salar.

Despite these important di(cid:27)erenes, however, there are also a number

of harateristi features of Hilbert's theory as presented in the published

version that are already found in the proofs. For a reonstrution of Hilbert's

part in this episode, it seems worthwhile to point out these harateristis

here as well.

that

For one, Hilbert did not introdue any hanges in the onluding remarks

of his paper, whih distintly eho his programmati onern of the 1900

Paris problems. Summarizing the main points of his note, Hilbert onluded

the possibility draws near that physis will beome, in priniple,

a siene of the same kind as geometry: ertainly the most mag-

ni(cid:28)ent glory of the axiomati method, whih here, as we see,

takes into its servie the most powerful devies of analysis, i.e.,

the alulus of variations and invariant theory.

78

The emphasis of this onluding passage suggests that Hilbert saw his om-

muniation as a ulmination of his work in physis along his program of an

axiomati treatment of physis. Using advaned and sophistiated mathe-

matial tehniques, his aim was to promote theoretial physis to that mathe-

matized and axiomatized state that geometry had already reahed. Hilbert's

note, as he laimed, represented a ma jor ahievement in this endeavour.

3.1 The gravitational (cid:28)eld equations

Hilbert's emphasis on the role of invariant theory and the alulus of varia-

tions points to a feature of his theory whih distinguishes it from Einstein's

Entwurf theory and whih is also already found in the proofs. In the Entwurf

theory, as expounded in [Einstein 1914℄, Einstein gave a onise and indepen-

dent introdution to the mathematis of the (cid:16)absolute di(cid:27)erential alulus(cid:17)

of Rii and Levi-Civita in a speial setion headed (cid:16)From the Theory of Co-

variants.(cid:17)

But while the onepts of this setion do provide a framework for

79

the formulation of a theory whih is generally ovariant, i.e., ovariant with

respet to arbitrary oordinate transformations, gravitational (cid:28)eld equations

whih manifestly are not generally ovariant were derived from a variational

priniple in setion D of that paper by introduing a restrition of the theory

to so-alled adapted oordinate systems.

In his (cid:28)rst November ommuni-

ation Einstein had then replaed these (cid:28)eld equations by a di(cid:27)erent set of

(cid:28)eld equations, also derived from a variational priniple but still not gener-

ally ovariant. The (cid:28)eld equations of his seond November ommuniation,

equating the Rii tensor to the energy-momentum tensor, then (cid:28)nally were

generally ovariant but these (cid:28)eld equations were not derived from a varia-

tional priniple.

Hilbert, in his ommuniation, introdued gravitational (cid:28)eld equations

whih are derived from a variational priniple and whih are generally o-

variant. Thus, in ontrast to Einstein's Entwurf theory and in ontrast to

Einstein's (cid:28)rst November ommuniation, he did not write down gravita-

tional (cid:28)eld equations of restrited ovariane, and, in ontrast to Einstein's

seond November ommuniation, Hilbert did formulate the generally ovari-

ant (cid:28)eld equations in terms of a variational priniple.

In fat, Hilbert based his theory on two (cid:16)axioms.(cid:17) The (cid:28)rst axiom intro-

dues an ation integral

H√gdτ,

Z

(1)

where g is the determinant of the metri and dτ = dw1dw2dw3dw4 with (cid:16)world
parameters(cid:17) wi uniquely determining the (cid:16)worldpoints,(cid:17) i.e., the oordinates
The world funtion H is postulated to be

of a four-dimensional manifold.

80

a funtion depending on the omponents of the metri tensor, its (cid:28)rst and

seond derivatives, as well as on the omponents of the eletromagneti four-

potential and its (cid:28)rst derivatives. The axiom spei(cid:28)ally postulates that the

laws of physis are determined by the ondition that the variation of the

integral (1) vanish. The seond axiom then postulates that H transforms as
an invariant under arbitrary transformations of the oordinates wi .

81

In the proofs, the (cid:28)eld equations are not expliitly spei(cid:28)ed. They are

only given as Lagrangian derivatives of the undetermined but invariant (cid:16)world

80

81

In the disussion of Hilbert's note, I will losely follow Hilbert's own notation.

In

partiular, oordinates will be written with a subsript index, no summation onvention is

implied, and oordinate derivatives are indiated by simple subsript indies. A modern

reader should also be aware of the fat that, although Hilbert does distinguish between

ontravariant, supersript and ovariant, subsript indies (exept for the oordinates), he

does not raise or lower indies by means of the metri.

any ase, already in the proofs, Hilbert in a footnote insists that his world

funtion is invariant whereas Einstein's is not.

The quantities K and L are referred to immediately after the missing passage of [p. 8℄
of the proofs, and the splitting into K + L is referred to later in the paper by an equation

number whih is missing exatly at that plae. One possible reason for Hilbert's utting

out this piee would be that he wanted to paste it into some other manusript in order to

be spared the pains of opying the equations by hand. He had done a similar thing before

in his notes for a leture ourse on Eulidean geometry from 1898/99, when he pasted

some of his axioms of onnetion ((cid:16)Axiome der Verbindung(cid:17)) taken from [Hilbert 1895℄

into his manusript notes, see SUB Cod. Ms. Hilbert 551, pp. 10f. Another suh example

is SUB Cod. Ms. Hilbert 549 (Notes for a leture ourse on (cid:16)Zahlbegri(cid:27) und Quadratur des

Kreises,(cid:17) winter 1897/98), pp. 38f. If the exised piee of the proofs had orresponded to

the lines printed on the bottom of p. 402 of the published version, it would have ontained

the de(cid:28)nitions of the Riemann urvature salar and of the Rii tensor as in eqs. (4) and

(cid:16)Grundgleihungen der Physik(cid:17) was the title of Hilbert's leture to the Göttingen

Mathematial Soiety of November 16. It was also the title under whih Hilbert announed

3.2 The onept of energy

Hene, the restrited ovariane of the theory in the proofs does not a(cid:27)et the

gravitational (cid:28)eld equations. But in the proofs the term (cid:16)Grundgleihungen(cid:17)

does not refer to the gravitational (cid:28)eld equations alone. As a onsequene

of a mathematial theorem, to be disussed in the next setion, Hilbert saw

that of the 14 (cid:28)eld equations obtained by Lagrangian di(cid:27)erentiation with
4 = 10 were
respet to the metri and the eletromagneti potential, only 14

−

mutually independent. In the proofs, Hilbert then introdued four additional

equations (cid:22) of restrited ovariane (cid:22) in order to satisfy the priniple of

ausality as Einstein had done in the Entwurf and as Hilbert initially thought

neessary in order to guarantuee the determinate harater of the di(cid:27)erential

equations in Cauhy's sense:

Thus, if we want to preserve the determinate harater of the

fundamental equations of physis aording to Cauhy's theory

of di(cid:27)erential equations, we must postulate four additional non-

invariant equations whih supplement [the gravitational and ele-

trodynami (cid:28)eld equations℄

91

Already in his letter to Einstein of November 14, Hilbert had talked about

(cid:16)the still missing 4 spae-time equations.(cid:17)

92

In order to arrive at suh additional equations, Hilbert proeeded to de(cid:28)ne

a onept of energy. Hilbert is not very expliit about the justi(cid:28)ation for

his energy onept but what he does is quite lear. In his de(cid:28)nition of the

his ommuniation in the letter of invitation irulated among the Aademy members

between November 15 and the meeting of November 20, and it was the title under whih

his ommuniation was initially entered into the (cid:16)Journal(cid:17) of the (cid:16)Nahrihten(cid:17), p. note

73. Sine, however, the (cid:28)rst proofs, whih I assume to represent Hilbert's manusript of

November 19, already have the title (cid:16)Grundlagen der Physik,(cid:17) Hilbert must have hanged

the title probably with the manusript whih he gave to the printer, i.e., before or on

November 19. The hange in title may have been a reation to Einstein's laim in his

letter of November 18 that Hilbert's equations appear to be equivalent to the ones he had

found and presented to the Aademy in his (cid:28)rst two November ommuniations.

of the invariant worldfuntion H with respet to an (cid:16)arbitrary ontragredient

(cid:16)in the same manner as one treats in the alulus of

pure divergene term. The (cid:28)rst term, obviously, arises from the fat that (cid:16)po-

must be varied. Without expliitly inserting the expression into the ation

integral, Hilbert thus e(cid:27)etively derived the gravitational (cid:28)eld equations by

variation of the ation integral with respet to the metri, if only hµν

be

regarded as an arbitrary variation of the metri tensor. But at this point, he

is ontent with a reformulation of the (cid:16)polarized(cid:17) integrand in terms of the

(cid:28)eld equations and a pure divergene term.

Hilbert only introdued pµν

as a symmetri ontravariant tensor without mentioning

that it represents a Lie derivative or a variation of the metri. However, Klein, in a (cid:28)rst

note from January 1918 on Hilbert's (cid:28)rst ommuniation, refers in this ontext to Lie's (cid:16)nu-

merous relevant publiations(cid:17) ((cid:16)zahlreihe einshlägige Verö(cid:27)entlihungen,(cid:17) [Klein 1917,

p. 471℄). In a seond note on Hilbert's paper from July 1918, Klein nevertheless found

it neessary to elaborate on the meaning of pµν

by an expliit alulation in an extra

introdutory paragraph ([Klein 1918, p. 173℄).

97

It is at this point that the proofs whih otherwise are of a fairly (cid:28)nished harater

display some irregularities whih may indiate a ertain preliminary nature of the on-

sideration. First, the sentene introduing this expression is grammatially inomplete.

Seond, Hilbert orreted the fator ps

multiplying the (cid:28)rst term from a misprinted ps

and put an exlamation mark in the margin (proofs, p. 5). Third, in the remainder of the

proofs, Hilbert mistakenly referred to his equation (10), whih is our (9), where learly his

equation (9), whih is our (10), was meant.

27

where the supersript (g) indiates that the eletromagneti potentials are

to be ignored in forming the derivative.

Hilbert alled the expression E the energy form ((cid:16)Energieform(cid:17)), jus-

tifying this name by pointing out two properties. First, he noted that a

omparison of √gJ (h)
with √gJ (p)
derivatives with respet to ws ,

is substituted for hµν
as given in eq. (9) shows that E may be expressed as a sum of

as given in eq. (7), where pµν

E =

D(p),

h=p −

(cid:0)

if the gravitational (cid:28)eld equations hold and hene beomes a divergene.

The disussion of the seond property, unfortunately, was mutilated by

utting away part of the sheet on whih it was given. But the argument

an nevertheless be reonstruted. Looking at E as given in (11) Hilbert

noted that if one were to go one step further and also remove the derivative

theorem in the old theory(cid:17),

an only hold if and only if the four quantities es vanish, i.e., if and only if

The latter two equations are not generally ovariant. The validity of eq. (14)

and hene the validity of eq. (15) was stipulated by a third axiom, and the

four equations (15) omplemented the ten gravitational (cid:28)eld equations (2) to

a system of 14 equations for the 14 potentials gµν

, qs . It is these 14 equations,

(2) and (15), whih Hilbert in the proofs alled the (cid:16)system of fundamental

equations of physis.(cid:17)

99

This part of the proofs, i.e., the derivation of the energy onept was

rewritten for the published version. The third axiom, introdued in the

proofs, postulated a restrition of the ovariane of the theory.

Its stipu-

lation introdued a distintion between spae-time oordinates and world

parameters, the former being those oordinates for whih the non-generally

ovariant energy equations (14) hold. This third axiom was later dropped in

3.3 Theorems about the invariant variational problem

Both the proofs and the published paper present three mathematial theo-

rems, all three of them drawing onsequenes from the invariane of a La-

grangian funtion and the ation integral with respet to arbitrary oordinate

transformations.

The (cid:28)rst theorem is a speial ase of a general theorem about invariant

variational problems proven three years later by Emmy Noether and known

as Noether's (seond) theorem.

In Hilbert's ommuniation it is formu-

100

lated for an invariant (cid:16)world funtion(cid:17) J of the four (cid:16)world parameters(cid:17) whih
depends on n variables and their derivatives. The theorem then asserts that
if the n Lagrangian variational equations are formed, four mutually inde-
pendent linear ombinations of these n di(cid:27)erential equations and their total

derivatives are always satis(cid:28)ed, i.e., vanish identially. So far, the theorem

is a speial ase of Noether's theorem. But Hilbert went one step further by

asserting that the theorem implied that four of the n di(cid:27)erential equations
are always a onsequene of the remaining n
4 equations (cid:16)in the sense(cid:17)

−

that those linear ombinations hold. The proof of this theorem was given

neither in the proofs nor in the published version but announed for another

oasion.

101

While this (cid:28)rst theorem does not give an expliit onstrution of these

identities and, in fat, only asserts their existene, the other two mathemat-

ial theorems of Hilbert's (cid:28)rst note are formulated more expliitly. Hilbert

did not prove these theorems in the proof sheets either and introdued their

formulation by simply saying he would make use of them,

thus suggesting

that they were either well-known or trivial. In the published version, how-

ever, he did prove these two other theorems and introdued their formulation

by saying he would now (cid:16)establish(cid:17) those two theorems.

102

103

For the seond theorem, Hilbert added an alternative formulation in his

published version whih makes it more luid.

In this alternative formula-

tion, the theorem asserts that, given an invariant Lagrangian J depending
on the metri omponents gµν

, its (cid:28)rst and seond derivatives, and on the

3.4 Generalized eletrodynamis and Mie's theory

Using his theorems II and III, Hilbert pointed out two features of his general

variational framework whih onern the relation of the theory to speial

relativisti eletrodynamis and, in partiular, to Mie's theory as given in

Born's interpretation. In order to appreiate Hilbert's arguments, it is use-

ful to brie(cid:29)y summarize the main points of Born's reinterpretation of Mie's

theory.

Mie had formulated his theory in terms of a variational priniple,

107

introduing a Lorentz-ovariant Hamiltonian depending on the (cid:28)elds and the

eletromagneti four-potential. Born had generalized this ansatz by pos-

tulating a general Lorentz-ovariant Lagrangian Φ depending on dynami
∂uα/∂xβ in a
variables uα = uα(x1, x2, x3, x4) and their derivatives aαβ ≡
four-dimensional Minkowski spaetime with oordinates xα . The dynamis

of the general theory was governed by the variational priniple

whih yielded general Euler-Lagrange equations

that represents the energy-momentum of Mie's theory.

It is to this reformulation of Mie's eletrodynamis by Born that Hilbert

referred to in the following part of his paper. By his (cid:28)rst axiom, Hilbert

emphasized, in the proofs as well as in the published version, that his world

funtion H would not only depend on the metri tensor and its (cid:28)rst and
seond derivatives but also on the eletromagneti potentials qs and its (cid:28)rst
derivatives qsl .

In fat, Hilbert emphasized in a footnote that while the

general use of a variational priniple was a harateristi of Mie's theory, the

partiular use of the arguments qs and qsk was introdued by Born.

111

Hilbert now pointed out two onsequenes following from the assump-

tion of general invariane for H . From his Theorem II, Hilbert dedued the
following relation for the eletromagneti part L of the world funtion

(32)

sine, by assumption, L does not depend on the derivatives of the metri. By
setting the oe(cid:30)ient in front of pm
sk equal to 0, Hilbert then dedued that L

ould, in fat, only depend on the antisymmetrized derivatives

Mks = qsk −

qks.

(33)

Thus, Hilbert had shown that it followed from his seond axiom, i.e., from

the postulate of general ovariane, that the world funtion H = K + L an

indeed only depend on the antisymmetrized derivatives of the eletromag-

neti potential, i.e., on the (cid:28)eld tensor, although the eletromagneti part L
of world funtion H initially was introdued as a funtion depending on all
derivatives of qs .

Hene Hilbert had shown that, in the generalized frame-

112

work, this feature of Maxwellian eletromagneti theory was a onsequene

of the invariane of the world funtion with respet to arbitrary oordinate

transformations:

This result, whih (cid:28)rst gives the speial harater of the Maxwell

equations, arises here essentially as a onsequene of the general

113

The seond onsequene of the postulate of general invariane diretly re-

ferred to Mie's energy-momentum tensor. Again referring to eq. (32), Hilbert

noted that setting the oe(cid:30)ient of pν
m equal to 0 and taking into aount
that L depends only on the (cid:28)eld variables Mks as de(cid:28)ned in (33) one obtains

Comparing this expression with the orresponding expression (31) of Born's

theory, Hilbert noted that Mie's energy tensor is obtained in his generally

ovariant, variational framework by generally ovariant operations and sub-

sequent speialization to the ase of speial relativity,

an insight obtained

at least by mid-Otober and already then ommuniated to Sommerfeld and

an insight whih Hilbert had taken great pleasure in ((cid:16)Hauptvergnügen(cid:17)), as

he reports to Einstein in his orrespondene of November 13. Nowadays, the

energy tensor of any theory is obtained by variation of the matter Lagrangian

with respet to the metri, but for Hilbert this result was intimately linked

with his understanding of the theory as a generalization of Mie's eletrody-

nami (cid:28)eld theory of matter. In his paper, Hilbert summarized this insight

in the following words:

Hene, Mie's eletromagneti energy tensor is nothing but that

generally ovariant tensor whih is obtained by di(cid:27)erentiation of

the invariant L with respet to the gravitation potentials gµν

3.5 Gravitation, eletromagnetism, and the theory of

matter

The (cid:28)rst mathematial theorem of Hilbert's paper, as disussed above, as-

serted the existene of four independent identities between the fourteen (cid:28)eld

equations obtained by Lagrangian di(cid:27)erentiation of the ation integral. This

mathematial theorem was interpreted by Hilbert as implying that the gen-

eralized Maxwell equations may be regarded as a onsequene of the grav-

itational (cid:28)eld equations in the sense that the four linear ombinations of

the Maxwell equations and their total derivatives identially vanish. Thus

Hilbert wrote

As a onsequene of that mathematial theorem we an imme-

diately assert that, in the sense indiated, the eletrodynamial

phenomena are e(cid:27)ets of gravitation.

117

and, adding even more emphasis to this feature of his theory, he alled this

insight into the relation between eletromagnetism and gravitation the (cid:16)Leit-

motiv(cid:17) of his theory.

However, although Hilbert seemed to believe that

118

the validity of the gravitational (cid:28)eld equations implied the validity of the

generalized Maxwell equations, he onretized his assertion by deriving the

preise mathematial form of those four identities in the (cid:28)nal part of his

paper.

Finally, the freedom to speify the world funtion by non-linear so long as

invariant terms of the eletromagneti potential in the sense of Mie opened

up the possibility that non-linear generalizations of Maxwell's equations may

4 A speulative reonstrution

Given these harateristis of Hilbert's theory whih are already found in the

(cid:28)rst proofs, the following senario of Hilbert's path towards his uni(cid:28)ed (cid:28)eld

theory of eletromagnetism and gravitation, inluding generally ovariant

gravitational (cid:28)eld equations and generalized Maxwell equations in the sense

of Mie, is suggested. The senario would be the following: being interested

in fundamental theories of physis, Hilbert studied Mie's theory as early as

1913 as a novel and attrative (cid:28)eld theory of matter. An important step was

Born's work of late 1914 on Mie's theory, whih reinterpreted Mie's varia-

tional ansatz in terms of speial-relativisti ontinuum mehanis, pointing

out formal relations to Herglotz's speial-relativisti elastiity theory, whih

Hilbert knew well. Hilbert had also heard about Einstein's and Grossmann's

theory as early as Deember 1913 through a talk at the Göttingen Mathe-

matial Soiety. Just as in the ase of Mie's theory, Hilbert must have had a

genuine interest in attempts at generalizing the speial theory of relativity,

for Hilbert the heritage of his friend Minkowski's geometri reinterpretation

of the Lorentz transformations. When Hilbert then sueeded in inviting

Einstein to ome to Göttingen he was intrigued by the latter's presentation.

As Einstein found, Hilbert and the other Göttingen mathematiians were

ompletely onvined by the theory.

123

Thus, when Hilbert went away for his summer vaation to Switzerland

and Rügen, he had the following situation to ponder on. Both Mie's the-

ory, in partiular as reinterpreted by Born, and Einstein's theory of 1914

started from a variational priniple with a Lagrangian of a ertain ovari-

ane group. Mie's theory was invariant with respet to the orthogonal group

of speial relativity. The mathematis of Einstein's theory was set up to be

invariant with respet to general di(cid:27)eomorphisms but in his 1914 exposition

of the Formale Grund lage der al lgemeinen Relativitätstheorie Einstein had

expounded the hole argument justifying the neessity of restriting the o-

variane of the theory and elaborated an intriate mathematial argument

for the unique spei(cid:28)ation of the orret Lagrangian in aordane with his

so-alled (cid:16)adapted(cid:17) oordinate systems. The argument was based on a rather

pedestrian treatment of the ovariane properties of the ation integral, dis-

tinguishing between somewhat hybrid variations restrited by Einstein's on-

ept of (cid:16)justi(cid:28)ed(cid:17) oordinate transformations. Now, invariant theory and the

123

[Pais 1982, p. 259℄, CPAE8, Do. 110, p. note 47.

38

alulus of variations were (cid:28)elds of Hilbert's expertise, and when Einstein pre-

sented his onsiderations in July 1915 in Göttingen, he found that everything

was understood, inluding the details. Nevertheless, Einstein's mathemati-

al treatment of adapted oordinate systems must have appeared awkward to

Hilbert just as they had appeared (cid:28)shy to the mathematiian Levi-Civita.

124

Mie's theory on the other hand had other problems. For one, Mie's theory

of gravitation might not have been too attrative. Also, Mie had spei(cid:28)ed

his world funtion by adding a term of sixth power in the potential and had

expliitly integrated the resulting di(cid:27)erential equation.

The result was

unsatisfatory to Mie beause the resulting eletrons would neither be in-

divisible nor stable. Mie's eletrons would tend to attrat eah other and

then simply merge into a single huge lump of harge.

However, his theory

125

126

formulated a researh program by posing the problem of (cid:28)nding a satisfa-

tory Lagrangian funtion. The researh program was formulated by Born as

follows:

In earlier times, one formulated the goal of the mehanial expla-

nation of nature, to derive all physial and hemial properties of

matter by assuming a Lagrangian funtion Φ for the interation

of the atoms.

In the same way Mie now poses the problem of

hosing his (cid:16)world funtion(cid:17) Φ suh that from it follows on the

basis of his di(cid:27)erential equations the existene of the eletron and

of the atoms, as well as all their interations. I should like to see

this problem as the mathematial ontent of that program whih

regards the establishment of an (cid:16)eletrodynami worldview(cid:17) as

the aim of physis.

And Hilbert, who knew well both the relation between a variational ansatz

and the implied di(cid:27)erential equation and the omplexity of non-linear dif-

ferential equations, regarded Mie's researh program, as formulated here by

Born, as the real hallenge of theoretial physis.

One of Hilbert's (cid:28)rst ideas might have been to generalize the ovariane

of Mie's theory and to integrate it into a ommon mathematial framework

of both Mie's and Einstein's theories. Mathematially, something like the

metri tensor introdued by Einstein would also show up if one simply al-

lowed for general oordinate transformations in Mie's theory. Why not let

Mie's world funtion depend on the metri omponents as well, and add it to

the Lagrangian of Einstein's theory? Using generally ovariant operations,

one might then see whether Mie's results are obtained in the speial rela-

tivisti limit, whih would give onrete physial meaning to the generalized

theory. This indeed proved to be the ase for Mie's energy tensor. Would

it also hold for the eletron? Hilbert might then have investigated general

properties of the resulting di(cid:27)erential equations, drawing on his knowledge

of partial di(cid:27)erential equations and on knowledge about what we would now

all the Lie derivative. This might have given him the insight that ovariane

with respet to di(cid:27)eomorphisms yielded additional relations between the (cid:28)eld

equations, a result whih immediately suggested that the ten gravitational

(cid:28)eld equations and the Maxwell equations were not independent.

These are vague onsiderations, of ourse. The Hilbert arhive ontains a

number of disparate alulations, whih are hard to identify or even only

to date. There is opportunity for future researh.

In any ase, Hilbert

obtained most of the harateristi features of his (cid:28)rst note already in the

fall of 1915, with the exeption of the expliit form of the (cid:28)eld equations in

terms of the Rii tensor and the realization that the restritive impliations

of energy onservation are but a remnant dark spot of Einstein's previous

misoneptions.

5 Aftermath

Five days after Hilbert had submitted his ommuniation to the Göttingen

Aademy, Einstein presented a fourth ommuniation to the Berlin Aademy.

128

In this ommuniation Einstein presented his (cid:28)nal (cid:28)eld equations, the Ein-

Ziel der Physik hinstellt.(cid:17) [Born 1914, pp. 24℄.

stein equations where a trae term was added to the energy-momentum ten-

sor. The introdution of the trae term had two deisive onsequenes. First,

the requirement of energy onservation no longer implied restritions on the

permissible oordinates. The theory now was fully ovariant. A distintion,

in Hilbert's terms, between (cid:16)world parameters(cid:17) and (cid:16)spae-time oordinates(cid:17)

was no longer neessary. Seond, the gravitational (cid:28)eld equations no longer

implied that the trae of the energy-momentum tensor of matter had to

vanish. Hene, the (cid:28)eld equation no longer implied anything about the on-

stitution of matter.

We don't know whether or when Einstein sent opies of his (cid:28)nal ommuni-

ation to Hilbert, but we may assume that he did, just as he had sent his (cid:28)rst

ommuniation to Hilbert, and in any ase Einstein's (cid:28)nal ommuniation

was available in print by Deember 2.

129

Hilbert, therefore, had oasion to think about his own theory in the light

of Einstein's last November ommuniation. And in any ase, he ontinued

working on his theory. Thus, roughly a week later, on November 30, he and

Caratheodory gave a talk to the Göttingen Mathematial Soiety on invariant

theory.

And four days later, on Deember 4, Hilbert presented a seond

130

ommuniation on the (cid:16)Foundations of Physis(cid:17) to the Göttingen Aademy.

About the ontent of this seond ommuniation nothing is known sine its

publiation was postponed, at least for the time being.

On that Aademy

131

meeting of Deember 4, Hilbert also presented a note by Emmy Noether

with the title (cid:16)Krümmungsinvarianten im mehrdimensionalen Raume(cid:17) for

publiation in the Aademy's Nahrihten. We don't know either what the

point of this paper was sine it was later o(cid:30)ially withdrawn

and the

132

manusript appears to be lost.

day, Deember 4, 1915, Hilbert wrote to the Prussian minister on behalf of

Noether's habilitation. In this letter he wrote:

... also the mathematial-physial developments (Einstein's the-

ory of gravitation, theory of time and spae) are presently moving

towards an unforeseen point of ulmination; and in this matter

Miss Noether is my most suessful ollaborator ...

133

The next day, Deember 5, Hilbert, Klein, Voigt, Runge, and Wiehert

wrote a proposal to the Göttingen Aademy suggesting that Einstein be

eleted as a orresponding member.

Two days later, on Deember 7,

134

Hilbert and Caratheodory ontinued their leture on invariant theory in the

Göttingen Mathematial Soiety.

135

With Hilbert's ommuniation in press and Einstein's (cid:28)nal ommuni-

ation already published, the heti feverishness of November now abated

somewhat. It seems that Hilbert took the oasion of Einstein's eletion as

a orresponding member of the Göttingen Aademy, whih took plae on

the Aademy meeting of Deember 18, to inform him about his eletion in a

personal letter before the o(cid:30)ial notie.

The hronology of Einstein's eletion as a orresponding member of the Göttingen

Aademy is as follows: on November 22, the seretary of the mathematial-physial lass,

Ehlers, had sent out an invitation to an (cid:16)unverbindlihe Vorbesprehung(cid:17) on Saturday,

November 27, following a request by Klein ((cid:16)Nah einem Wunshe des Herrn F. Klein(cid:17)

(GAA Pers 10.3, 25). It was in all probability Klein who took the initiative about the

eletions to the Aademy in Deember 1915; see notes about the Aademy's members and

a list of possible andidates in SUB Cod. Ms. Klein III F, sheets 9(cid:21)11, dated 29 November

1915. The proposal for the eletion of Einstein ((cid:16)einer der tiefsten und erfolgreihsten

Forsher im Gebiete der theoretishen Physik(cid:17)) as a orresponding member was dated

Deember 5 and was signed by Hilbert, Klein, Runge, Voigt, and Wiehert (GAA Pers 20,

913). On Deember 8, Ehlers invited the members of the lass to the meeting on Saturday,

Deember 11, announing that it had been suggested to elet P. Debye and H. Stille as

full ((cid:16)ordentlih(cid:17)) members, G. Cantor as external ((cid:16)auswärtig(cid:17)) member, and A. Einstein

as well as P. Koebe as orresponding ((cid:16)korrespondierend(cid:17)) members (GAA Pers 10.3, 25).

The (cid:28)nal eletion then took plae at the joint meeting of both lasses on Deember 18

(GAA Chron 2.1, Vol. 6, 413). The o(cid:30)ial notie was sent out on Deember 22 (GAA

Einstein himself wrote a oniliatory response to Hilbert after having some-

what settled his own emotional turmoil around his November breakthrough,

writing

another.

137

It is ob jetively a pity if two guys who have somewhat worked

their way free of this shabby world don't take pleasure in one

After having been fored to a somewhat premature write up of his results,

Hilbert now reonsidered the alulations in the (cid:28)rst set of proofs for his om-

muniation, in partiular those about the energy theorem. It probably took

Hilbert some time but eventually he found that he ould indeed derive an

energy expression whih also gave Mie's energy tensor in the limit of speial

relativity but whih satis(cid:28)ed a onservation law that was not of restrited o-

variane. The latter feature was in agreement with Einstein's fourth and (cid:28)nal

ommmuniation of November 25 whih ontained the (cid:28)nal (cid:28)eld equations

of Einstein's theory. The additional trae term introdued in that ommu-

niation to the gravitational (cid:28)eld equations implied that energy-momentum

onservation no longer posed a restrition on the admissible oordinates.

Now Hilbert also found an energy expression whih, together with his (cid:28)eld

equation, was identially onserved without imposing additional onstraints.

It is not lear when Hilbert ahieved this insight but on January 25, 1916, he

Chron 8, Vol. 6). Einstein aknowledged his eletion in a letter to the Aademy dated

Deember 23 (GAA Pers 20, 416).

In 1923, Born suggested that A. Einstein and N. Bohr be eleted as external members

of the Aademy (GAA Pers 19, 498). Einstein's letter of aknowledgment of 17 Otober

1923 ontains the following amusing postsript:

(cid:16)Ih vermute, dass ih shon Mitglied der `Gesellshaft der Wissenshaften in

Göttingen' bin, da ih seit einigen Jahren die Göttinger Nahrihten erhalte.

Ih erlaube mir, dies beizufügen um zu verhüten, dass ih irrtümlih ein

zweites Mal gewählt werde.(cid:17) (GAA Pers 19, 501)

On November 28, 1933, after several inquiries about Einstein at other aademies and also

at the German Embassy in Washington, the Aademy's Seretary informed the Curator

of Göttingen University that Einstein had been deleted from the list of external members

of the Aademy (GAA Pers 66, 18(cid:21)23). Letters of reoniliation were sent out to the

exluded members in August 1945 and again in Deember 1946 (GAA Pers 6, 10, 36). To

these letters, Einstein did not respond.

gave a leture to the Göttingen Mathematial Soiety on (cid:16)invariant theory

and the general energy theorem.(cid:17)

And sine his (cid:28)nal ommuniation was

138

probably in press by mid-February, we may assume that he had found his

new energy expression by that time and that his talk of January 25 presented

a disussion of the energy onept as ontained in the published version of

his ommuniation.

In the proofs, as disussed above, Hilbert had derived his energy onept

by looking at the expression √gJ (p)
invariant H with respet to the metri gµν

where J (p)

was the (cid:16)polarisation(cid:17) of the

. The result had been an (cid:16)energy

form(cid:17)

E = esps + el

sps
l

(40)

(41)

whih ould also be written in terms of the gravitational (cid:28)eld equations and

a pure divergene term as

E =

−

[√gH]µν pµν +

D(h)
(cid:16)

(h=p) −

D(p)

.

(cid:17)

The term es had been identi(cid:28)ed as a total derivative of √gH taking into
aount only the dependene of the world funtion H on the metri and its

derivatives.

In the published paper, Hilbert now formed a (cid:16)polarisation(cid:17) of √gH with

respet to all variables, the metri omponents and the eletromagneti po-

tential.

In the notation of his Theorem II, he onsidered the expression

P (√gH) = Pg(√gH) + Pq(√gH). Now Hilbert's aim was to derive an ex-
pression whih only depended on the arbitrary vetor ps
had a vanishing oordinate divergene. He showed that P (√gH) ould be

linearly, and whih

as is readily seen by looking at the de(cid:28)nition of el
dl
in eqs. (43)(cid:21)(46) and taking into aount that the eletromagneti part L
does not depend on the derivatives of the metri. Using that L depended, in

And sine eq. (34) whih followed diretly from Hilbert's seond theorem

remained valid, it followed that the eletromagneti part of his new energy

onept again yielded Mie's energy-momentum tensor. Hene the onlusions

about Mie's theory as a speial ase of Hilbert's theory also remained valid.

But the new energy vetor was identially onserved, by virtue of eq. (49),

for any system of oordinates. Hene the stipulation of its validity by an extra

axiom did not add anything to the theory, its validity was already implied by

the (cid:28)rst two axioms, and hene the third axiom of the proofs was no longer

independent from the (cid:28)rst two axioms and had to be dropped. This result

was in agreement with Einstein's onlusions of his (cid:28)nal November memoir.

Hilbert might also have thought about the relation of his version of the

(cid:28)eld equations given as variational derivatives of an invariant and Einstein's

(cid:28)nal (cid:28)eld equations whih were given in terms of the Rii tensor and the

Riemann urvature salar. In the published version, he added a remark to

the e(cid:27)et that for the splitting of H into H = K + L, with K representing
the Riemann salar and L the eletromagneti part depending only on qs ,
qsl and gµν

, the (cid:28)rst term on the left hand side of the (cid:28)eld equations (35)

assumed the expliit form

[√gK]µν = √g(Kµν −

(52)

and justi(cid:28)ed this assertion that it followed (cid:16)without alulation(cid:17) from the fat

that Kµν and gµν

and its (cid:28)rst and seond derivatives.

140

The argument may not follow so easily without alulation but is nevertheless

true if it is understood that the seond derivatives of the metri tensor enter

only linearly and if the ondition is taken into aount that the ombination

of Kµν and gµνK has to satisfy the ontrated Bianhi identity (24) derived

in Hilbert's Theorem III.

141

With the representation of his (cid:28)eld equations in terms of the Rii tensor,

Hilbert also had to omment on the relation of his own (cid:28)eld equations to

those published by Einstein in his November equations. The omparison

was not so easy beause, for one, the soure term of the (cid:28)eld equations

in Hilbert's and in Einstein's theory were not neessarily identi(cid:28)able.

In

Einstein's theory it was an unspei(cid:28)ed (cid:16)energy tensor of matter,(cid:17) exempli(cid:28)ed

either by an inoherent, pressureless (cid:29)ow of partiles (dust) or by the energy-

momentum tensor of Maxwellian eletrodynamis. For Hilbert it was the

eletromagneti part of his energy vetor el
(cid:16)world funtion(cid:17) H into a gravitational part K and an eletromagneti part
L and with his result that, as a onsequene of general ovariane, L ould
only depend on the eletromagneti potential qs and on its antisymmetrized
derivatives Msl , there is hene some freedom to determine L and hene to

. With Hilbert's splitting of the

determine the energy-momentum tensor of matter in Mie's sense. Seond,

Hilbert never set the determinant of √g equal to 1 as Einstein was still doing

(cid:16)in the usual manner(cid:17)

even in his fourth November ommuniation where

142

suh a speialization was no longer neessary for the equations to hold.

143

And the presentation of what amounted in fat to three di(cid:27)erent versions

of (cid:28)eld equations by Einstein within four weeks may have made it di(cid:30)ult

to deide unambiguously what Einstein's new (cid:28)eld equations really were. In

fat, what may seem from hindsight as three distint and alternative versions

141

It is also possible that Hilbert took the fator −

1/2 in eq. (52) for the trae term gµνK

by looking at the (cid:28)eld equations of Einstein's (cid:28)nal November equation, as Corry, Renn

and Stahel suggest ([Corry, Renn and Stahel 1997, p. 1272℄). However, Einstein added

the trae term to the matter tensor Tµν and the equivalene of these two forms rests not

only on the trivial equivalene of putting the trae term to the left or right hand side of

the (cid:28)eld equation but also on the perhaps more problemati identi(cid:28)ation of Einstein's

Tµν with Hilbert's

In a postard to Shwarzshild, dated 26 February, 1916, Hilbert expliitly pointed

out this di(cid:27)erene to Einstein's theory: (cid:16)Ih möhte Sie nur darauf aufmerksam mahen,

proofs were eq. (26). When Klein undertook his systemati omparison of Einstein's and

Hilbert's energy expressions in 1918, he also omplained about the hanging treatment of

the √g fator in Einstein's papers, [Hilbert and Klein 1985, p. 142℄.

of (cid:28)eld equations was presented by Einstein as essentially the same set of

equations plus ertain hypotheses about the hoie of oordinates and about

the onstitution of matter, or modi(cid:28)ations of the vauum (cid:28)eld equations

in the presene of matter. Nevertheless, Hilbert onjetured that the (cid:28)nal

equations advaned by Einstein were equivalent to his own if K is taken to

be the Riemann salar:

The resulting di(cid:27)erential equations of gravitation are, it seems

to me, in agreement with the broad theory of general relativity

established by Einstein in his later papers.

144

And to this passage he added a referene to all four November ommunia-

tions by Einstein, inluding the (cid:28)nal one, submitted to the Berlin Aademy

on November 25 and published a week later on Deember 2, 1915. With these

remarks Hilbert's note was prepared for press, by mid-February Hilbert re-

eived o(cid:27)prints of his paper and, by the end of Marh, the last 1915 issue of

(cid:16)A ertain resentment(cid:17)

With and after the publiation of their respetive notes, neither Einstein nor

Hilbert themselves publily ever entered into a dispute of priority. Neverthe-

less, during the heti period of November some tension between Hilbert and

Einstein had arisen as is lear already from the tone of the orrespondene of

that time and, in partiular, from Einstein's expliit o(cid:27)er of reoniliation in

his response of Deember 20 to Hilbert's informing him about his eletion as

a orresponding member of the Göttingen Aademy. In this letter Einstein

wrote:

144

145

There was a ertain resentment between us, the ause of whih

you with unmixed friendliness, and I ask you to try to think of

me in the same way.

In fat, Einstein had voied bitter feelings against Hilbert in a letter to

Heinrih Zangger, one of his losest friends, written on November 26, one

day after Einstein had presented his (cid:28)nal (cid:28)eld equations, representing the

ompletion of his General Theory of Relativity to the Berlin Aademy. In

this letter to Zangger of November 26, Einstein had aused Hilbert of the

(cid:16)nostri(cid:28)ation(cid:17) of his results.

146

As John Earman and Clark Glymour in their aount of the November

1915 episode emphasized, (cid:16)questions about the priority of disoveries are

often among the least interesting and least important issues in the history of

siene.(cid:17)

Nevertheless, for the reonstrution of oneptual innovation in

147

the natural sienes, they may have a heuristi value in the identi(cid:28)ation of

new insights, and Hilbert's (cid:28)rst ommuniation on the foundation of physis

has often been ommented on in the literature in this respet.

148

Both Hilbert and Einstein saw their ahievements of November 1915 as

the ulmination of year-long e(cid:27)orts of sienti(cid:28) researh along their respetive

researh programs. This may aount for a ertain irritability on both sides.

But sine Einstein's and Hilbert's researh programs were by no means iden-

tial, the question arises as to the identi(cid:28)ation of those issues where both

sientists felt that they had to seure their laims of priority. Einstein's

resentment against Hilbert annot have been indued by Hilbert's publia-

tion of the (cid:28)eld equations in the expliit form in terms of the Rii tensor

and the Riemann salar, nor in the establishment of full, unrestrited gen-

eral ovariane. His ausation of nostri(cid:28)ation was expressed at the time

of Hilbert's (cid:28)rst proofs whih did not yet ontain the expliit form of the

(cid:28)eld equations and whih still postulated a restrition of the ovariane by

the additional four spae-time equations postulated by the third axiom in

the proofs. And this third axiom was only dropped in the published version

when Hilbert had found his new energy vetor. Hene, one may also question

whether even Einstein's o(cid:27)er of reoniliation of Deember 20 was a reation

analysieren will. Gegen das damit verbundene Gefühl der Bitterkeit habe ih gekämpft,

und zwar mit vollständigem Erfolge.

This letter is the sub jet of [Medius 1984℄ and is, in fat, undated. It has been dated

by ontext to November 26 in Volume 8 of the Col leted Papers of Albert Einstein. To

be preise, Einstein does not mention Hilbert by name but it seems beyond doubt that

Hilbert was meant.

[Earman and Glymour 1978, p. 291℄.

[Guth 1970℄, [Mehra 1974℄ seem to have been the (cid:28)rst to raise the issue of priority.

to Hilbert's revisions of his paper.

It seems more probable that Einstein regarded Hilbert's axiomati inter-

pretation of his theory as a (cid:16)nostri(cid:28)ation(cid:17) and that he ob jeted to Hilbert's

treating his gravitation theory as a mere mathematial preliminary to his

own theory. In fat, in his (cid:28)rst axiom Hilbert had postulated that the (cid:16)world

funtion(cid:17) H would depend on the omponents of the metri tensor gµν
(cid:28)rst and seond derivatives, as well as on the eletromagneti potential qs

, its

and its derivatives. And both quantities had been introdued in the preed-

ing paragraph on the same footing as the (cid:16)quantities whih haraterize the

proesses in the world,(cid:17)

namely

149

1) the ten gravitation potentials gµν (µ, ν = 1, 2, 3, 4) with sym-

metri tensor harater with respet to an arbitrary transforma-

tion of the world parameter ws ;
2) the four eletrodynami potentials qs with vetor harater in

the same sense.

150

From hindsight, it was the introdution of the metri tensor whih implied

the most radial break with lassial spae-time onepts by providing both

the hronogeometrial and the inertio-gravitational strutures and whih thus

represented the (cid:16)ruial step in the development of general relativity.(cid:17)

But

151

already at the time, Einstein had a lear understanding of the revolutionary

and innovative oneptual impliations of his general theory of relativity

whih, at that time, had also made him an outsider in the (cid:28)eld of gravitation

theory.

Hilbert had aknowledged (cid:16)the tremendous researh problems of

152

153

154

Einstein and his perspiaiously devised methods for their solution(cid:17)

in the

(cid:28)rst paragraph of his note. But, in the published version, he expliitly gave

redit to Einstein for the introdution of the metri tensor, adding that those

ten gravitational potentials were (cid:16)(cid:28)rst introdued by Einstein.(cid:17)

While Hilbert thus gave redit to the oneptual justi(cid:28)ation of Einstein's

metri theory of gravitation, he nevertheless laimed that he had indepen-

dently derived the (cid:28)eld equations of General Relativity from a variational

priniple. So, of ourse, did Einstein who did not refer to Hilbert in his (cid:28)nal

ommuniation. To be sure, sine John Norton's 1984 aount of Einstein's

route towards general relativity who argued that (cid:16)Einstein's (cid:28)nal steps were

self-ontained(cid:17)

no serious argument was ever advaned disputing Einstein's

155

independene in deriving his (cid:28)eld equations of November 25. Nevertheless,

sine Hilbert's published note only ontained the date of presentation to the

Aademy, November 20, predating Einstein's fourth ommuniation, whih

was presented to the Berlin Aademy on November 25, by (cid:28)ve days, some

ommentators have haphazardly onjetured that Einstein may have taken

the trae term introdued in his (cid:28)nal ommuniation by looking at Hilbert's

paper.

This onjeture an now be regarded as de(cid:28)nitely refuted by the

156

(cid:28)rst proofs of Hilbert's paper.

157

But the independene of Einstein's disovery was never a point of dispute

between Einstein and Hilbert. Nor was the independene of Hilbert's deriva-

tion of the (cid:28)eld equation ever disputed by Einstein. Hilbert laimed priority

for the introdution of the Riemann salar into the ation priniple and the

derivation of the (cid:28)eld equations from it,

and Einstein admitted publily

158

that Hilbert (and Lorentz) had sueeded in giving the equations of general

relativity a partiularly luid form by deriving them from a single variational

[Norton 1984, p. 314℄.

See, e.g., [Fölsing 1993, p. 421℄.

Thus, Hilbert apparently had ob jeted to the presentation in a paper by Herglotz on

the geometri impliations of the introdution of the Riemann tensor into gravitation the-

ory published in early 1917 ([Herglotz 1916℄). In a defensive response, Herglotz admitted

that he should have pointed out that the tensor Kµν

159

Hilbert's irritation in November 1915, I would like to suggest, referred

to Einstein's (cid:16)Nahtrag(cid:17) to his (cid:28)rst November ommuniation, presented to

the Berlin Aademy on November 11.

In this (cid:16)Nahtrag(cid:17) Einstein had

160

advaned generally ovariant (cid:28)eld equations, equating the Rii tensor to

the energy-momentum tensor of matter, and justi(cid:28)ed these equations by the

hypothesis that the trae of the energy-momentum tensor of matter vanish.

This was a neessary onsequene of these (cid:28)eld equations if one wanted to (cid:28)x

the oordinates suh that √

g be a onstant, and this oordinate ondition

−

had to be imposed in order to reover the (cid:28)eld equations of Einstein's (cid:28)rst

November ommuniation. Sine the trae of the energy-momentum tensor

vanishes for the eletromagneti energy-momentum tensor but not neessarily

for other tensors, e.g. not for the energy-momentum tensor of inoherent

pressureless dust, the (cid:28)eld equations hene implied a hypothesis about the

onstitution of matter. As Einstein said:

There are indeed not a few who hope to be able to redue mat-

ter to purely eletromagneti proesses. These proesses, how-

ever, would have to be governed by a theory whih generalizes

Maxwell's eletrodynamis to a ompleted theory.

161

Clearly, Hilbert must have understood this as a referene to Mie's eletrody-

nami (cid:28)eld theory of matter. And Einstein's laim that the (cid:28)eld equations

implied a hypothesis about the onstitution of matter just touhed on the

(cid:16)Leitmotiv(cid:17) of Hilbert's own theory. Indeed, as was disussed above, Hilbert

interpreted his (cid:28)rst theorem about the implied existene of four identities

between the 14 (cid:28)eld equations and their derivatives, in the sense that the

eletrodynami phenomena are e(cid:27)ets of gravitation. And it is well possible

that Hilbert had informed Einstein about this harateristi of his theory

in that (cid:16)friendly letter(cid:17) whih, unfortunately lost, he had sent Einstein in

response to Einstein's initial orrespondene of November 7.

But the subsequent introdution of the trae term in Einstein's (cid:28)eld equa-

tions of November 25, implied not only that energy-momentum onservation

(cid:16)In letzter Zeit ist es H.A. Lorentz und D. Hilbert gelungen, der allgemeinen Rel-

ativitätstheorie dadurh eine besonders übersihtlihe Gestalt zu geben, daÿ sie deren

no longer imposed a restrition on the admissible oordinates. It also made

the hypothesis of the (cid:16)Nahtrag(cid:17) super(cid:29)uous, a onsequene whih Einstein

expliitly pointed out:

On the other hand the postulate of general relativity annot dis-

lose anything about the other phenomena of nature that would

not already follow from speial relativity. My former opinion,

expressed reently in this forum, was erroneous.

162

With Einstein's retreat regarding his laim about impliations of his gravita-

tional (cid:28)eld equations for an inherent eletromagneti onstitution of matter,

the danger of a priority problem for Hilbert, as far as Einstein was onerned,

had vanished.

7 Conluding remarks

The substantial lasting innovation of Hilbert's (cid:28)rst note on the foundation

of physis was the foundation of Einstein's general theory of relativity on an

invariant variational priniple as an equivalent representation of the gravita-

tional and eletromagneti (cid:28)eld equations and the mathematial elaboration

of some onsequenes whih follow alone from the invariane of the ation

integral with respet to arbitrary transformations of oordinates. These in-

sights inlude the disovery of a speial ase of Noether's seond theorem,

the derivation of the generalized ontrated Bianhi identities from the varia-

tional priniple in his Theorem II, as well as the introdution of the Riemann

urvature salar into the variational integral. Other innovative features of his

note have not stood the test of time. Among these are his ideas on a uni(cid:28)ed

(cid:28)eld theory of gravitation and eletromagnetism and his energy vetor.

With regard to the (cid:28)nal establishment of a theory of unrestrited, general

ovariane and the interation between Hilbert and Einstein in this matter,

I should like to venture the following historial assessment of Hilbert's work.

Hilbert's knowledge and understanding of the alulus of variations and of

invariant theory readily put him into a position to fully grasp Einstein's

and the subsequent axiomati reinterpretation of Einstein's theory as well as

Hilbert's way of restriting general ovariane in order to guarantuee energy

onservation and ausality by means of a third, independent axiom in the

(cid:28)rst proofs of his note, posed, it seems to me, ob jetively a threat to the del-

of Einstein's Entwurf theory, as ahieved by his 1914

reading Einstein's (cid:28)nal November ommuniation while reviewing the proofs

of his note, I should like to suggest that Hilbert's own justi(cid:28)ation of general

was based also on arguments of internal mathematial ohereny whih were

Hilbert's spei(cid:28) ontributions to the history of general relativity as well

as their limitations were onditioned by a vast knowledge of mathematis

and a broad knowledge of ontemporary theoretial physis, by the heuris-

tis of Hilbert's axiomati method of identifying basi assumptions and their

respetive impliations and of looking for fundamental and intriate mathe-

matial questions assoiated with physis, as well as by Hilbert's belief in the

unity of the mathematial sienes and in the feasibility of turning physis

into a mathematial disipline based on an axiomati foundation.

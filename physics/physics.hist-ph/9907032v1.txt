Study of the one-dimensional Schroedinger equation generated from the

hypergeometric equation

G.A. Natanzon

Received 24 October 1970; published October 1971

Note: Translated from Russian by H.C. Rosu (November 1998)

Original English Summary. - A systematic method of constructing potentials, for which

the one-variable Schroedinger equation can be solved in terms of the hypergeometric (HGM)

function, is presented. All the potentials, obtained by energy-independent transformations of

the HGM equation, are determined together with eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. A class of

potentials derived from the conﬂuent HGM equation is found by means of a limit process.

To study theoretically the rotational and rotational-vibrational spectra of diatomic molecules,

one often uses one-dimensional model potentials for which the solution can be expressed in terms

of the HGM functions [1]. The problem of the changes of variable in the HGM equation leading to

the one dimensional Schroedinger equation has been studied several times in the past [1, 2, 3],

but the quoted authors have considered only the case of potentials given in explicit form 1.

However, knowing the energy spectrum and the wavefunctions of the equation may prove useful

for many applied problems whether or not the potential is given in explicit or implicit form.

The general form of the transformations leading from the HGM equation to the Schroedinger

equation is determined by the requirement (z

= dz/dx)

Thus, one will get a semiparametric (i.e., including the constant of integration of the diﬀer-

ential equation) family of potential curves, for one can always choose in the role of the three

parameters, the scale factor, the origin of the coordinate x and the origin of the energy E.

For the Schroedinger solution given by Eq.(4) the variable z is considered within the interval

[0,1]. The corresponding interval for the variable x will be studied shortly.

Since the case of the potential well of inﬁnite depth is not of much interest, we shall ask the

three-term quadratic polynomial R(z) to have no zeros for 0 < z < 1, that is we shall consider

It follows from Eq.(7) that in the unit interval the function z(x) is monotone so that the corre-

sponding transformation is single valued. Eq.(10) implies 2

The transformation z(x) can be obtained in explicit form only for a few particular values of

the parameters a and cp. One should notice the case when the zeros of R coincide with the

singularities of the HGM equation. The resulting potentials have been already considered by

various authors as follows

The potentials (13-15) have the following general properties: the isotopic shift can be described

by means of some changes of the parameters f , h0 and h1. This property does not extend to the

whole family of potential curves given by Eq.(9). The scale transformation of the coordinate x

leads in this case to an equation with ﬁve singular points, 0, 1, z1, z2, and

, where z1 and z2

∞

are the zeros of R.

Let us ﬁnd now the interval where x is deﬁned for ∆

= 0. For that, we ﬁrst notice that the

integral entering Eq. (12a) has no singularities, because from tp = √a or

= 0; if however one of the coeﬃcients cp is nought then the corresponding

choice of the coordinate origin for x as well as of the sign in Eq.(12a) can be done such that

Finally, the variable x has a ﬁnite deﬁnition interval whenever both c0 and c1 are zero.

The case when only one of the cp coeﬃcients, for example c0, is zero, is of special interest for

the theory of two atom molecules, because for x

0 (z

0) the function 2M b0U (x) goes to

It is easy to see that the spectrum is bounded from above, if and only if both c0 and c1 are

not zero, and therefore, it follows from Eq.(20) that the discrete part of the spectrum has only

a ﬁnite set of energy levels. Only the potential curve Eq.(13a), for which c0 = c1 = 0, has an

inﬁnity of discrete levels.

If two of the three parameters σ1, σ2 and c0 turn to zero, Eq.(31) is easy to solve with respect to

ζ and the potential leads in this case to: a) a spherically symmetric oscillator well (or barrier) for

σ2 = c0 = 0 [11]; b) a Morse potential for σ1 = σ2 = 0 [12]; a Kratzer potential for σ1 = c0 = 0

[13, 14].

We remark that in the work [15] an implicit potential occurs for which the Schroedinger

equation is turned into a conﬂuent HGM equation. This potential can be obtained from Eq.(30),

if σ2 = 0. The assumptions in [15] may be considered equivalent to a transformation ζ(x) not

depending on energy and therefore the results of [15] can be easily obtained in our framework.

Let us study now the deﬁnition interval of x. For ζ

MAKING OLD SEMINAL RESULTS WORLD-WIDE AVAILABLE !

FORWARD

The seminal paper of Crum, published in 1955, is now a standard reference in
nonlinear science and supersymmetric quantum mechanics. It introduces the Crum
transformations, a cornerstone of integrability and a beautiful generalization of
Darboux transformations.

Since I am sure that many people would like to study carefully this masterpiece
I oﬀer here a LaTex version of the paper. The purpose is to prevent all sorts of
rediscoveries and promote real progress. I did very minor changes with respect to
the old published version. The most important was to put the list of references at
the end and not as footnotes. Crum’s paper has 7 points. The ﬁrst point is the
statement of Crum’s theorem, i.e., the possibility to write the solutions of a tower
of so-called associated Sturm-Liouville (SL) systems (all of them Dirichlet from the
point of view of boundary conditions) as a quotient of Wronskian determinants.
The second point refers to the ﬁrst associated SL system, dealing in fact with the
SL Darboux transformations. Points 3 and 4 are a detailed study of the higher
order associated SL systems (SL supersymmetric partners). Point 5 contains four
noted applications. The corollary of Crum’s theorem is at point 6. Finally, point 7
states the possibility to build a regular SL system with any ﬁnite set of real numbers
as eigenvalues, starting from a given associated SL system, a remarkable general
result.

have eigenvalues λ0 < λ1 < λ2, etc, and eigenfunctions φs corresponding to λs. Let
q(x) be repeatedly diﬀerentiable in (0,1); then the φs also are repeatedly diﬀeren-
tiable; let Wns be the Wronskian of the n + 1 functions φ0, φ1,..., φn−1, φs and let
Wn be the Wronskian of the n functions φ0, φ1,..., φn−1. Then, if n ≥ 1 and

φns = Wns/Wn ,

the functions φns (s ≥ n) are the eigenfunctions, with eigenvalues λs, of the system

For n = 1, the system (An, Bn) is regular; but, for n > 1,

qn(x) = q(x) − 2

qn(x) ≈

(cid:26)

n(n − 1)x−2
n(n − 1)(1 − x)−2

(x → 0) ,
(x → 1)

Inside (0,1), Wn is non-zero and qn is continuous. For s < n, φns ≡ 0; for s > n,
φns has exactly s − n zeros inside (0,1). The family φns (s ≥ n) is L2-closed and
complete over (0,1).

The system (An, Bn) may be called the ‘nth system associated with the system
(A, B)’. In this note the above statements are established, and examples are given
of systems associated with non-regular Sturm-Liouville systems.

If q(x) is continuous but not diﬀerentiable, the φs are diﬀerentiable twice only,
and the Wronskians do not exist; however, when the Wronskians Wns, Wn exist,
ns, W ∗
they are equal to the modiﬁed Wronskians W ∗
by
(−λs)kφs, and φ(2k+1)
s; the W ∗
n are at least twice diﬀerentiable, and
the statements above are true for non-diﬀerentiable continuous q provided that the
W are replaced by W ∗.

since φs has exactly s zeros [1] inside (0,1), by Rolle’s theorem, φ1s has at least
s − 1. But from (F1) and (G) and Rolle’s theorem, φ1s has at most s − 1 zeros
inside (0,1); hence it has s − 1 exactly. it follows [1] that the φ1s (s ≥ 1) are all the
eigenfunctions of the regular system (A1, B1). For λ 6= λ0 the general solution of
(A1) is

X1 = W (φ0, χ)/W1 ,

where χ is the general solution of (A). For λ = λ0, W (φ0, χ) is constant and one
solution of (A1) is 1/φ0; two independent solutions are

It is easily veriﬁed that the only solutions of (A1) which satisﬁes (G) are the φ1s (s ≥

By (Kn), φnn, and so also Wn+1, is non-zero inside (0,1), so that qn+1 and φn+1,s

φs = φs(0)[1 + h(0)x + O(x2)] ;

and (J1) is a case of (H1). It remains to deduce (Gn+1) to (Kn+1) from (Gn) to
(Kn). First, by (Dn+1), (Hn), (Jn),

whence we have (Gn+1) with

Cn+1,s = Cns/(2n + 1) 6= 0 .

By diﬀerentiating this last we obtain (Hn+1), of which (Jn+1) is a special case.

From (Dn+1) and (Kn), φn+1,s has at least s − n − 1 zeros inside (0,1); from
(Fn+1), (Kn), (Gn), it has at most s − n − 1 zeros inside (0,1); hence (Kn+1) is
deduced.

Lastly we may prove that, as x → 0,

qn(x) = n(n − 1)x

−2 + O(1) ,

(Ln)

with a similar relation as x → 1. For, given (Ln) and (Jn),

qn+1 = qn − 2v

n = 2λn + 2v2

n − qn = O(1) + n(n + 1)x

−2 ,

which is (Ln+1).

For λ 6= λs (s < n) the general solution of (An) is

y = χn = W (φ0, φ1, ..., φn−1, χ)/Wn ,

where χ is the general solution of (A). For λ = λn−1 a solution is

4. Since the system (An, Bn) is not regular for n > 1, it remains to prove that
(s ≥ n) is L2-complete over (0,1); this implies incidentally that the
the family φns
φns are the only bounded solutions of (An). Since (A1, B1) is regular, it is suﬃcient
to verify that the completeness of the family φns implies that of the family φn+1,s.

5. Examples

(1) If q(x) = 0, h(0) = 0 = h(1), then λs = (2πs)2, φs = cos 2πsx (s = 0, 1, 2, ...).

Since v = 0, q1 = q and

′

φ1s = φ

s = 2πs sin 2πsx

(s = 1, 2, ...) .

For n > 1, φns is obtainable as in Example 3.

(2) If q(x) = x2 and the interval is (−∞, ∞), (A) is y

+ (λ − x2)y = 0, with

φ0 = e− 1

, λ0 = 1. Since v = x, q1 = x2 − 2; hence [2]

λs+1 = λs + 2 ,

φ1s = ksφs−1 .

The associated systems are all identical, λs = 2s + 1, and, since

φ0φs =

(φ0φ1s) =

6. As a corollary of the main theorem, if

n

S(x) =

csφs(x) ,

then S(x) has at most n zeros in (0,1). This result is due to Kellogg [6]. For, if
S(x) has k zeros, then by Rolle’s theorem

has at least k − 1 zeros inside (0,1); by induction

has at least k −m zeros, and Sn(x) = cnφnn has at least k −n; since φnn is non-zero,
either k ≤ n or cn = 0; but, if cn = 0, then k ≤ n − 1 ≤ n.

This proof of the corollary depends only on the fact that the Wronskians Wn
are non-zero. If φs = eαsx, where the αs are any distinct real numbers, then the
Wn are all non-zero, and so S(x) has at most n real zeros.

7. If (A, B) is given, the associated systems (An, Bn) are uniquely deﬁned; but
to a given (An, Bn) belong an inﬁnity of (A, B). For example, given (A1, B1) we
may solve for v

′

λ0 − v

+ v2 = q1 ,

with any λ0 such that λ0 < λ1; then, if

x

φ0 = exp

vdξ

,

(λ0 − λs)φ0φs =

(φ0φ1s) ,

(cid:19)
it will follow that the φs are the eigenfunctions of (A, B) with

0
(cid:18)Z

d
dx

q = q1 + 2v

,

′

h(0) = v(0) ,

h(1) = v(1) .

8 Crum . . .

For example, if

we can take

q1 = 0 ,

λs = (2πs)2 ,

φ1s = sin 2πsx ,

λ0 = −ρ2 ,

φ0 = sechρ(x − α) ,

v = −ρtanhρ(x − α) ,

q(x) = −2ρ2sech2ρ(x − α) ,

φs(x) = 2πs cos 2πsx − ρtanhρ(x − α) sin 2πsx .

Starting from a given (An, Bn) we can similarly construct an (A, B) with arbi-
trary λ0, λ1,..., λn−1 (provided only that λs+1 > λs). Thus there exists a regular
Sturm-Liouville system with any ﬁnite set of real numbers as eigenvalues.

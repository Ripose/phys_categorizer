On the Covariant Formulation of Dirac’s
Equation∗

By Cornel Lanczos in Berlin
(Received on August 3, 1929)

Version ISRI-04-11.2 January 16, 2013

Abstract

As a continuation of previous investigations, the formalism used there is
extended to the case when an external electric ﬁeld is present and the covariant
formulation is performed again. The equation system obtained allows no
restriction in the manifold of the quantities if an undesired overdetermination
is to be avoided. The combined appearance of the dual formations also
indicates an improbable internal properly of the system and suggests that
the underlying Dirac equation needs a modiﬁcation.
In
this paper Lanczos is actually discussing his “doubled Dirac equation,” from
which two Dirac ﬁelds forming an isospin doublet, and two Proca ﬁelds of
opposite parities, derive.)

(Editorial note:

In a previous paper1 we showed that Dirac’s system for a free electron is closely
related to the Hamiltonian quaternion operator. On the basis of the close relations of
this operator to the tensor analytical formulation of the four-dimensional space, we
arrived at a complete tensor analytical description. Operating with the imaginary
unit proves to be a purely formal tool. In fact, it disappears from the resulting
system, which then contains only real vector analytical quantities. In particular,
there appears an antisymmetric tensor of the type of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
strength, as well as two vectors, which can be compared to the electric and
magnetic currents of Maxwell’s theory. Namely, the couplings between these
quantities fully correspond to those in Maxwell’s equations, the only exception
being that there is a further coupling present which, together with the others,

consequently determines the Schr¨odinger equation.2 Until now we have only dealt
with the equation for a free electron, and now we want to extend the investigation
to the case where an external electromagnetic ﬁeld is also present.

In the case of Dirac’s equation, the rule for performing the extension is the
∂xi is to be completed by adding iΦi, where Φi means

following: The operation ∂
the external vector potential multiplied by 2π

h e:

eϕi.

Φi =

2π
h
It is obvious that this extension can be performed according to the same rule
in our covariant system as well without disturbing the covariance. Namely, the
components Φi transform in the same wav as ∂
∂xi ; and the appearance of i causes
no difﬁculty because arbitrary complex quantities may appear in our quaternion
calculus although the real interpretation is naturally assured.

(1)

Let us write down our basic equation (54) (loc. cit) once more and in a form
which makes no use of the speciﬁc reality conditions of the actual space-time
continuum and thereby ensures the actual covariance:

F = αG∗,
∇
G∗ = αF. )
∇

Let us now apply the rule and replace the ∂
thereby the following system:

Here Φ is the quaternion representing the vector potential whose components are
the Φi. It is real in its spatial part and purely imaginary in its time part. Therefore

Before discussing the whole equation system, let us ﬁrst consider Dirac’s
equation which must form a subsystem of the complete system. We saw [cf.,
equation (61), loc. cit.] that such a subsystem exists for the combination:

H =

[(F + G) + i(F

G)jz],

and from this we obtain by addition or subtraction:

∇

These are two Dirac equations for H or H ′ alone,3 which altogether are obviously
equivalent to the initial system (5). It is easy to see that the introduction of the
vector potential actually means replacing the operation ∂
∂xi + iΦi. Namely,
from assignment (60), loc. cit., it can immediately be seen that multiplication of
ψ by i is equivalent to H being multiplied by
jz. It is remarkable that the vector
potential occurs with opposite sign in both equations, so the ﬁrst equation contains
∂xi + iΦi whereas the second contains the operation ∂
the operation ∂
It is interesting to analyze the transformation properties of the completed Dirac
equation. Let us perform a Lorentz transformation once more [cf. equation (18),
loc. cit.] by putting:

∂xi by ∂

∂xi −

iΦi.

and let the transformation of H be again [cf., equation (85), ibid.]:

[This H ′ has nothing to do with the H ′ in equation (8).]

Now we have two conditions for quaternion k:

The second condition comes from the term with the vector potential and is respon-
sible for k being real:

k = k∗.

H ′ = pHk.

k jz = jzk.)

Then, however, k can have only one jz and one jl component. Thus, there remain
only two degrees of freedom which can be reduced to a single one by normalizing
the length. However, for the ψ this means only one further phase transformation,
which is also permitted in quantum mechanics.

Accordingly, the group of transformations which we referred to in the previous
paper (see Section 9) will fail, and thus the customary transformation theory of the
ψ quantities is valid. Also, the objections to the current vector of Dirac’s theory
cannot be maintained any longer, and, in fact, the covariance of the current vector
is guaranteed.

It seems all the more strange that the quaternion formed from F and G during

the covariant extension, which corresponds to a divergence free current vector:

∗

∗

F F

+ GG

,

does not represent any vector and has no vector analytical meaning at all. (It has
a vector character only under purely spatial rotations.)4

To deduce Schr¨odinger’s wave equation, let us now apply the operation

Equation (17) represents Schr¨odinger’s wave equation completed by the spin
interaction, which follows from Dirac’s theory as a speciﬁc effect without any
special assumption.

Now we leave the quaternion formalism and try to write our equations in tensor
analytical interpretation where we shall again regard F to be an antisymmetric
tensor (invariant in its time part), and G as a complex vector. We use the same
notation as in our ﬁrst discussion [see equations (96)], except that we now prefer
a way of description which eliminates the occurrence of imaginary quantities in
general. To this end, we leave the four Minkowskian coordinates and regard
the real time as being introduced as a fourth coordinate. Then we only have to
distinguish between covariant and contravariant. At the same time, however, we
can also bring the system into a generally covariant form in which the system
remains invariant not only under linear but under any point transformation. This
means that our equation system is related to arbitrary curvilinear coordinates.

On the one hand, we have the system (18A) which is analogous to Maxwell’s

equations and is now modiﬁed as follows:

Let us compare the obtained system with that of the previous paper where
the vector potential did not occur (Section 10). Then we shall ﬁnd a number
of remarkable differences, which seem to hinder a simple interpretation of the
equations to a larger extent than it was expected before. The previous formulation
could be considered as a generalization and completion of Maxwell’s equations.
The generalization consisted of the occurrence of the two scalars S and M, which
entered the system because it did not contain any internal dependence, and thus
the conservation laws for electric and magnetic current could not be deduced as
a necessary consequence. The completion was done by attaching new equations
which were called “feedback” because we considered them as the reaction of the
system upon itself. The emerging manifold of quantities could be reduced by
putting both the scalars and the magnetic current equal to zero. In this way, we
arrived at a still closer connection to the customary form of Maxwell’s equations.
Though we then had 16 equations for 10 functions (the ﬁeld strength and the
electric current), no overdetermination occurred because the surplus equations, as
consequences of the remaining ones, were satisﬁed automatically.

If we try to proceed in an analogous way here as well, we shall see that nothing
can be put equal to zero without producing an overdetermination. For instance, if
we put S and M = 0, then the last two equations of system (18B) will be obtained
as a consequence of the others only if Φi are constant, otherwise, an additional
term will appear which depends on the external ﬁeld strength and does not vanish.
Similarly, we must not put the “magnetic current” equal to zero if we want to avoid
an overdetermination.

However, it is very unlikely that such a manifold of quantities would really
appear. In view of the fact that we have one vector potential only, the appearance
of two vectors Si and Mi cannot be understood. We could expect that by putting
one of the vectors equal to zero, we could utilize the resulting overdetermination
as ﬁeld equations for the vector potential. However, it does not seem possible
to bring the ∆-equations of the vector potential into such a relationship. Thus,
we should take into account the complete system which also contains the four
equations for the vector potential, without the three vectors Si, Mi, Φi having an
essential inner connection with each other. Of course, this appears to be quite
unbelievable.

6

Furthermore, we have no reference point for understanding the characteristic
correction terms which appeared in the equations because of the vector potential.

Finally, we wish to point out a characteristic difﬁculty of another type caused
by the fact that the dual constructions occur in the equations in combination with
the non-dual ones.

In terms of tensor analysis, the dual forms have the following meaning: In
addition to the fundamental metrical tensor gik which is a symmetric tensor of
second-order, there is a second fundamental tensor of nth-order (i.e., of fourth-
order in the four-dimensional space) in each manifold. This second fundamental
tensor has a peculiar structure: it is antisymmetric in all indices. This means that
all components vanish where any two of the indices are equal. The non-vanishing
components are deﬁned as follows: The covariant components are equal to:

and the contravariants are equal to;

√g ηiklm,

1
√g

ηiklm,

1
√g

uµvνwρrσηµνρσ,

where η means the following: η = +1 if the permutation iklm of the four ﬁgures
1 to 4 is even, and η =
1 if this permutation is odd. With the help of this tensor
−
we can construct from four vectors the invariant:

and we obtain the determinant of the four vectors in the numerator, and therefore
we call this tensor a “determinant tensor.”

The dual formations of tensor analysis are produced by normal multiplication
using just this special tensor. For example, for an antisymmetric tensor of second-
order Fik, we can construct the following new tensor:

F ik =

Fµνηµνik.

1
2

1
√g

This is just the “dual” tensor. In this way, we can obviously ﬁnd a corresponding
antisymmetric dual formation of (n
m)th-order for each antisymmetric formation
of mth-order.

−

e

The determinant tensor is of the same type as any other tensor except that a
square root is employed for its deﬁnition, whereby the sign becomes undeﬁned.

7

(20)

(20’)

(21)

(22)

It is easy to see that in the case of a reﬂection, the determinant tensor obeys the
transformation of a common tensor only if the latter changes the sign of the square
root. Accordingly, one should determine the sign of √g, e.g., by prescribing
1 in all “left-hand” ones. However it is
+1 in all “right-hand” systems and
not possible to characterize a “right-hand” system of coordinates on the basis of
invariant principles.

−

There remains only the possibility of normalizing the sign of √g generally, e.g.,
to +1. Then all formations created with the determinant tensor have the peculiarity
that the normal transformation formulae used in their transformation have to
1 if we perform a transformation with negative determinant
include the factor
(reﬂection) (so-called “axial” formations in contrast to the “polar” ones).

−

To explain these conditions, which may not be generally known in the above
connection, let us consider an example from three dimensional tensor analysis.
We can write the ﬁrst system of Maxwell’s vacuum equations as follows (time is
now treated as a common scalar quantity):

∂Ei
∂t

=

1
c

(23)

ηµνi.

∂Hν
∂xµ

1
√g
(Here g is the determinant of the spatial line element). Now we can either deﬁne
the sign of √g as positive or negative, depending on whether our system is a
right- or a left-hand one (which, as we mentioned before, would make necessary a
non-invariant distinction and therefore it would not correspond to the spirit of the
general covariance). Then both Ei and Hi are ordinary vectors and the change of
the sign due to a reﬂection takes place within the equation. The other alternative is
to normalize the sign of √g to +1. Then either Hi or Ei must be an “axial” vector.
As it is known, in the four-dimensional approach this difﬁculty disappears. There
we can, if we want to, avoid the dual formation in general.5 However, even if we
keep it, dual formations will not occur combined with non-dual ones, and thus the
undeﬁned sign of √g will not cause a problem.

However, in our equation system (18A) and (18B) this is in fact the case. If
we want to keep our invariant standpoint, we are compelled to consider Mi as an
“axial vector” and M as an “axial scalar.” Interestingly enough, in the following
we should also treat Φi as an “axial vector.” This is, however, out of the question.6
For even if we suppose the less probable case where the vector potential would be
an axial vector, then the same should apply to the electric current. Since, however,

vector) particles, which are actually allowed by his fundamental equation (2).

velocity is certainly polar, charge should become an axial scalar. In Φi the charge
is now multiplied by the vector potential. This means that the two sign changes
disappear here as well, so a polar vector is produced in every case.

Now there is nothing left to do but to maintain the ambiguity of √g and
to distinguish the “right-hand” coordinate systems from the “left-hand” ones —
which means a certain concession to the general covariance.

It is interesting to note that this difﬁculty does not occur in Einstein’s new ge-
ometry of distant parallelism. Since there the metric is already composed quadrat-
ically from the fundamental quantities, the root of the determinant is accordingly
replaced by the determinant of the fundamental quantities itself. The determinant
tensor behaves under reﬂection in the same way as a common tensor, and the
distinction between polar and axial quantities becomes insigniﬁcant. Therefore
the dual formations have a much more natural character in this theory than in
Riemannian geometry in which the antisymmetric element in general represents
by its very nature something strange.

We have formally managed to bring the Dirac equation into a form which
completely satisﬁes the demands of customary tensor calculus and which suggests a
pure ﬁeld theoretical description. If the obtained equation system is unsatisfactory
at some points and also displays inexplicable elements, this is perhaps not to be
interpreted as a proof that the course followed here is misleading. The close relation
of Dirac’s operator to the Hamiltonian quaternion operator, on the one hand, and the
close relation of this operator to the four-dimensional tensor analysis, on the other,
suggest that the connection found must be more than a superﬁcial coincidence.
The ﬁeld theoretical viewpoint chosen here, which only permits operations with a
tensor analytical meaning and requires an interpretation for imaginary quantities
in terms of real quantities as well,7 may lead to a heuristic approach for a natural
improvement of Dirac’s theory, by which its conversion into tensor analytic form
may provide an equation system which displays more internal consistency and has
a greater probability of being proven correct than the one obtained here.

BRUNO PONTECORVO: MISTER NEUTRINO 1

S. M. Bilenky

Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna, R-141980, Russia, and
SISSA,via Beirut 2-4, I-34014 Trieste, Italy.

Bruno Pontecorvo was a great physicist who had enormous impact on
the development of neutrino physics. He was charming, marvelous person. I
worked with B. Pontecorvo in Dubna about 15 years and during these years
we were connected by warm, friendly relations. I this talk I will speak about
major contributions of Bruno Pontecorvo to neutrino physics and I will try
to convey my impression about his personality.

1 Radiochemical method of neutrino detec-

tion

In 1933-34 after a famous Pauli idea of neutrino and the discovery of the
neutron E. Fermi proposed the ﬁrst theory of the β- decay of nuclei. Fermi
assumed that the Hamiltonian of the process

has the vector form

n → p + e− + ¯νe

Hβ = GF ¯pγαn ¯eγανe + h.c.

After Fermi’s work in 1934 Bethe and Peierls made the ﬁrst calculation of
the cross section of interaction of neutrino with nuclei. They connected the
cross section of the process ¯νe + (A, Z + 1) → e+ + (A, Z) with the life-time
of the corresponding β-decay (A, Z) → e− + ¯νe + (A, Z + 1) and showed that
the cross section is extremely small ( ≃ 10−43cm2 at MeV energies). There
was no methods at that time which would allow to measure such small cross
sections. During more than 10 years neutrino was considered as undetectable
particle. W.Pauli wrote to his friend “....I have predicted something which
shall never be detected experimentally”

The ﬁrst method of neutrino detection was proposed by B. Pontecorvo in
1946 (Chalk River Laboratory report “Inverse β process” [1]). In this paper
he wrote

“It has been currently stated in the literature that inverse β-processes

produced by neutrinos can not be observed, due to the low yield.”

And further
“The object of this note is to show that experimental observation of
neutrinos is not out of question and to suggest a method which might make
an experimental observation feasible”

B. Pontecorvo considered the process

“neutrino′′ + (A, Z) → e− + (A, Z + 1)

At that time it was not known whether neutrino and antineutrino are the
same or diﬀerent particles. As a possible source of neutrinos B. Pontecorvo
considered reactor, the sun and radioactive materials which can be extracted
from reactor. The main idea of the proposed method was formulated as
follows

“radioactivity of the produced nucleus may be looked for as a proof of

B. Pontecorvo considered several reactions which can be used for neutrino

the inverse β process”.

detection. The process

νe +37 Cl → e− +37 Ar,
which later was named Pontecorvo-Davis reaction, he considered as the most
promising one. He wrote

(3)

“The experiment with Chlorine, for example, would consist in irradiating
with neutrinos a large volume of Carbon Tetra-Chloride for the time of the
order of one month and extracting the radioactive 37Ar from the volume.
The radioactive argon would be introduced into a small counter, the counting
eﬃciency is close to 100%, because of the high Auger electron yield.”

In 1948 B.Pontecorvo discovered the new high gas gain (up to 106) pro-
portional regime and proposed low-background proportional counter with
high ampliﬁcation [2]

Pontecorvo 37Cl −37 Ar method was realized by R. Davis in his pioneer
solar neutrino experiment for which he was awarded in 2002 the Nobel Prize.
Pontecorvo radiochemical method was used in the GALLEX and SAGE ex-
periments. The Pontecorvo counter was crucial for detection of neutrinos in
Homestake, GALLEX and SAGE experiments.

2 Universal weak interaction

After the famous Conversi, Pancini, Picconi experiment [3] in which it was
discovered that muon is not strongly interacting Yukawa particle, B. Pon-
tecorvo became fascinated by the muon. In the paper [] he noticed that the
probabilities of µ-capture by nuclei and electron K-capture are practically
the same (if kinematics and initial wave function eﬀects are taken into ac-
count). He came to the conclusion that in muon capture neutrino is emitted
and the spin of muon is equal 1/2. B. Pontecorvo concluded in [4] that “there
exists fundamental analogy between β- processes and processes of emission
and absorption of charged mesons” (muons) He was the ﬁrst who came to
the idea of the existence of an universal weak interaction which includes in-
teraction of nucleons with e − ν and µ − ν pairs. Later the hypothesis of
µ − e universality of weak interaction was proposed by other authors [5].

In 1947-49 in Canada B. Pontecorvo and E. Hincks made pioneer exper-

iments on the investigation of muon decay [6, 7]. They found

1. that the charge particle produced in the muon decay is electron (mea-

suring the intensity of the bremsstrahlung radiation)

2. that the decay µ → e + γ is forbidden (searching for electron-photon

3. that the muon decays into three particles (measuring electron spec-

coincidence)

trum).

3 Accelerator neutrinos, νµ 6= νe

In the end of the ﬁfties there was a plan in Dubna to build a meson factory.
In 1959 B. Pontecorvo started to think about the possibilities to do neutrino
experiments at meson factories and high energy accelerators. He came to an
idea of the feasibility of experiments with accelerator neutrinos. He under-
stood that one of the ﬁrst problem which can be solved in such experiments
is the problem of existence of two types of neutrinos (electron and muon).

From the time of the investigation of the muon decay B. Pontecorvo knew
that neutrinos which are produced in the decay of muon could be diﬀerent
(at that time they even have diﬀerent names: neutrino and neutretto, ν and
ν′ etc).
In the end of the ﬁfties there was a model dependent indication,
coming from the limit on µ → eγ, that νµ and νe are diﬀerent [9].

3

In 1959 B.P. proposed an accelerator experiment which could allow to
obtain the decisive answer on question of the existence of the second type of
neutrino [8]. His proposal was realized in the famous Brookhaven experiment
In 1988 L.Lederman, J. Steinberger and M. Schwartz were
in 1962 [10].
awarded the Nobel prize for the discovery of the muon type of neutrino.

4 The birth of neutrino oscillations

B. Pontecorvo was the pioneer of neutrino oscillations. He came to the idea
of neutrino oscillations in 1957 soon after the two-component neutrino theory
was proposed by Landau, Lee and Yang and Salam [11] and conﬁrmed by
Goldhaber et al experiment [12]. The two-component neutrino theory is
based on the assumption that neutrino is a massless particle and at that
time (and many years later) massless neutrino was a prevailing idea of many
physicists.

B. Pontecorvo believed in the analogy between the weak interaction of
hadrons (quarks) and leptons and he believed that in the lepton world there
exists phenomenon similar to K 0 ⇆ ¯K 0 oscillations. For the ﬁrst time he
mentioned the possibility of neutrino oscillations in the paper [13] in which
he considered transitions µ+e− → µ−e+ :

“If the two-component neutrino theory turn out to be incorrect and if
the conservation law of neutrino charge would not apply, then in principle
neutrino ⇆ antineutrino transitions could take place in vacuum.”

The ﬁrst paper on neutrino oscillations was published by Bruno Pon-
tecorvo in 1957[14] At that time F. Reines and C. Cowan [15] successfully
discovered antineutrino via the observation of the process

At the same time R.Davis [16] was doing the experiment with reactor an-
tineutrinos searching for the process

¯νe + p → e+ + n

−
¯νe +37 Cl → e

+37 Ar

(4)

(5)

A rumor reached B. Pontecorvo that Davis observed events (5). He published
the paper [14] dedicated to neutrino oscillations. He made the following two
basic assumptions:

1. Neutrino and antineutrino emitted in β-processes are diﬀerent particles.

4

2. Exists some interaction which do not conserve lepton number.

He wrote in [14]: “It follows from 1. and 2.
that neutrinos in vacuum
can transform themselves into antineutrinos and vice versa. This means
that neutrino and antineutrino are particle mixtures , i.e., a symmetric and
antisymmetric combination of two truly neutral Majorana particles ν1 and
ν2. “ And further in [14]:
‘...‘a beam of neutral leptons from a reactor
which at ﬁrst consists mainly of antineutrinos will change its composition
and at certain distance R from the reactor will be composed of neutrino and
antineutrino in equal quantities....; Thus, the cross section of the production
of neutrons and positrons in the process of the absorption of antineutrinos
from a reactor by protons (experiment of Reines and Cowan) must be smaller
than the expected cross section.”

B. Pontecorvo strongly believed in neutrino oscillations. From 1957 he
became great enthusiast of neutrino oscillations. For the rest of his life neu-
trino oscillations were his beloved subject.

From 1958 paper
“eﬀects of transformation of neutrinos into antineutrinos and vice versa
may be unobservable in the laboratory because of large values of R but will
certainly occur, at least on an astronomical scale”

I would like to stress that it was very nontrivial to propose neutrino os-
cillations in 1957, at the time when only one type of neutrino was known.
Oscillations, which B. Pontecorvo considered, were νL ⇄ ¯νL i.e. oscilla-
tions between active and sterile neutrinos. He proposed not only neutrino
oscillations but also existence of sterile neutrinos. By the way, the terminol-
ogy“sterile neutrino”, so popular nowadays, was invented by B. Pontecorvo
in 1967.

In the sixties B. Pontecorvo discussed the problem of neutrino mass with
L. Landau, one of the authors of the theory of two-component massless neu-
trino [17]. After Feynman and Gell-Mann [18], Marshak and Sudarshan [19]
V-A theory Landau changed his opinion about neutrino mass. From his point
of view after V-A theory it was very natural to assume that neutrinos, like
other fermions, have nonzero masses. He supported Pontecorvo idea of small
neutrino masses and oscillations.

After discovery of νµ it was natural (and not diﬃcult) for B. Pontecorvo
to generalize his idea of neutrino oscillations for the case of two types of
neutrinos. In 1967 paper [20] he considered all possible transitions between
two types of neutrinos: νµ ⇄ νe, transitions into sterile neutrinos νµ ⇆ ¯νµL

5

etc.

Before R. Davis published his ﬁrst result on the detection of solar neutri-

nos B. Pontecorvo wrote [20]

“From observational point of view the ideal object is sun. If the oscilla-
tion length is smaller than the radius of the sun region eﬀectively producing
neutrinos direct oscillations will be smeared out and unobservable. The only
eﬀect on the earth’s suﬃce would be that the ﬂux of observable solar neutri-
nos must be two times smaller than the total neutrino ﬂux”.
B. Pontecorvo envisaged the solar neutrino problem:
“the question of lepton conservation has a bearing on the interpretation

of the ﬁrst experiments which will be soon performed with sun neutrinos”

The paper of V. Gribov and B. Pontecorvo [21] was an important step
in the development of the theory of neutrino oscillations. It was an opinion
at that time that with left-handed neutrino ﬁelds νeL andνµL it is impossible
to introduce neutrino masses.
It is correct if total lepton number is con-
served. V. Gribov and B. Pontecorvo showed that if total lepton number is
violated it is possible to introduce neutrino (Majorana) mass term. In such a
scheme it will be transitions only between active neutrinos and antineutrinos.
They applied the developed formalism of two-neutrino oscillations to solar
neutrinos.

In retrospect B. Pontecorvo had a chain of connected neutrino ideas which
he developed all his scientiﬁc life. In 1946 he proposed radiochemical method
of neutrino detection which allowed R.Davis in his pioneer experiment to
discover solar neutrinos. He was the ﬁrst who understood that reactor and
the sun are sources of neutrinos which could be detected in an experiment.
In 1947 he came to an idea of the existence of µ−e universal weak inteaction.
He was one of the ﬁrst who understood the feasibility of experiments with
accelerator neutrino and he proposed the experiment which allowed to proof
that νµ and νe are diﬀerent particles. In 1958 he came to the idea of neutrino
oscillations.

5 Bruno Pontecorvo. Some recollections

B. Pontecorvo liked very much underwater ﬁshing. Usually he catch-ed ﬁsh
(may be a lot) in summer in Crimea during vacation. An Italian friend gave
him as a present the Calipso suit. So he could enjoy underwater ﬁshing also
in autumn in small rivers near Moscow. He liked the river Nerl about two

6

hours driving from Dubna. Usually he invited my wife and me for such trips.
Sometimes his wife Marian also was with us. While he was in a river we
made ﬁre and collected mushrooms. Often B.P. went out from river without
ﬁsh... ﬁre and mushrooms were there. Only once during very dry summer,
when ﬁres were forbidden, Bruno captured a lot of ﬁsh.

We started our collaboration on neutrino oscillations in 1975 in a car dur-
ing such trip. We published many papers and conference reports. In 1977
we wrote the ﬁrst review on neutrino oscillations[22] which attracted atten-
tion of many physicists to the problem of neutrino masses and oscillations.
Our last review was written in 1987 for the Italian Encyclopedia “Scienza e
Tecnica”.

We considered all possible neutrino mass terms (Dirac, Majorana, Dirac
and Majorana) and diﬀerent phenomenological possibilities to reveal eﬀects
of small neutrino masses. We did not try to build the theory of neutrino
masses. 2 Our general point of view was the following

• We do not know the values of neutrino masses. Neutrino oscillations as
an interference phenomenon are sensitive to extremely small neutrino
mass-squared diﬀerences. Investigation of neutrino oscillations give us
an unique possibility to study the problem of small neutrino masses
and neutrino mixing.

• Neutrino experiments with neutrinos from diﬀerent facilities are sensi-
tive to diﬀerent values of neutrino mass-squared diﬀerences. Neutrino
oscillations must be search for in all possible neutrino experiments.

This strategy brought success. It required many years and heroic eﬀorts of
many experimental groups [24] to reveal eﬀects of tiny neutrino masses. The
discovery of neutrino oscillations was real triumph of Bruno Pontecorvo who
proposed neutrino oscillations and pursued the idea of oscillations for many
years, when the general opinion favored massless neutrinos and no neutrino
oscillations.

The years of work and friendship with Bruno Pontecorvo were the hap-
piest and unforgettable years in my life. His wide and profound knowledge
2After long discussions in one of our ﬁrst paper [23] we concluded, however. “It seems
to us that the special cases of mixing angle θ = 0 and θ = π/4 are of the greatest interest”.
This expectation is not very far from the present-day situation with large θ12 and θ23 and
small θ13

of physics, his love of physics, his ingenious intuition and his ability to un-
derstand complicated problems in a clear and simple way were gifts of God.
Bruno Pontecorvo was a true scientist in the best, classical sense of the word.
When he thought about some problem he thought about it continuously from
early morning till late evening. He devoted all his resources and great intel-
lect to science, and though he was not indiﬀerent to the recognition of his
contribution to physics, his main stimulus was the search for the truth

More than ten last years were for Bruno Pontecorvo years of courages
struggle against Parkinson disease. His love to physics and to neutrino helped
him to overcome diﬃcult problems of the illness. He never stopped to work,
to think about neutrinos and to continue active life.

Two days before his death he was in his oﬃce at the second ﬂoor of the
Laboratory of Nuclear Problem in Dubna, where he spent 43 years. When he
was leaving the Laboratory for the last time he looked through the window
and said to his secretary Irina Pokrovskaja: “Look how beautiful are these
colours....” It was nice Russian September 1993.

Bruno Pontecorvo was born in Pisa in 1913. He entered the Engineer
Faculty of the Pisa University. After two years he decided to study physics
and joined faculty of Physics and Mathematics of Rome University. From
1931 till 1936 ﬁrst as a student and then as a researcher he worked in the fa-
mous Fermi group and was one of “ragazzi da via Pansperna”. B. Pontecorvo
participated in the discovery of the eﬀect of slow neutrons. In 1936-40 B.
Pontecorvo worked on nuclear isomerism in Joliot-Curie group in Paris. In
1940-42 he worked in USA. He developed the neutron well-logging, an eﬀec-
tive method of prospering for oil. In 1943-48 he worked in Canada. He took
part in design and starting up of a heavy water uranium research reactor.
In Canada B. Pontecorvo made muon experiments and started to work on

worked in Dubna.

Bruno had four brothers and three sisters. One of his brother Guido
was famous biologist. Gillo Pontecorvo is famous ﬁlm director. Opinion of
parents.... “Guido era il piu intelegente dei fratelli, Paolo era il piu’ serio,
Giuliana la piu’ colta, Bruno il piu’ buono ma il piu’ limitato, come era
demonstrato dai suoi occhi buoni ma non intelligenti...” (B. Pontecorvo. Una
nota autobiograﬁca) “Guido was the most intelligent among the brothers,
Paolo was the most serious, Giuliana was the most cultured. Bruno was the
most gentle but the most limited , as one could understand from his eyes
sweet but not intelligent...”

Bruno Pontecorvo was very friendly, nice, highly intelligent person. Ev-
erybody who was familiar with him love him. He had many friends in Italy,
Russia and other countries. He liked cinema, theater, music, literature, ten-
nis, football,...In 1988 when he was 75 there was a big celebration in Dubna.
Many of Bruno friends came. There were many talks and many jokes. Some
pictures from that celebration drawn by Misha Bilenky can be seen below.

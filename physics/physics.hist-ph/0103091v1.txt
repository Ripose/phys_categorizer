1 Introduction

Neutrinos are elementary particles. Three ﬂavor neutrinos exist in nature: the
electron neutrino νe, the muon neutrino νµ and the tau neutrino ντ .

Neutrinos are members of the three lepton families. Other particles that
are members of the families are, correspondingly,the electron e−, the muon µ−
and the tau τ −. There are also three families of other elementary particles, the
quarks: (u, d), (c , s) and (t, b)

There are three fundamental interactions of elementary particles that are
characterized by the strength of the interaction: strong, electromagnetic and
weak. There is also the fourth gravitational interaction between particles. How-
ever, it is so weak that it can be neglected at all available energies.

The strong interaction is the interaction between quarks and gluons, neu-
tral particles with spin 1. The interaction between quarks is the result of the
exchange of gluons. Protons, neutrons, pions and all other hadrons are bound
states of quarks.

The electromagnetic interaction is the interaction between charged particles
and γ -quanta. The Coulomb interaction between charged particles is due to the
exchange of photons. Atoms of diﬀerent elements are bound states of electrons
and nuclei.

The weak interaction is the interaction between fundamental fermions (quarks,
charged leptons, neutrinos) and charged W ± and neutral Z 0 bosons, heavy par-
ticles with spin 1 . For example, the β-decay of the neutron

u pair in
is due to the exchange of a charged W - boson between e
nucleons. Because of weak and electromagnetic interactions, all particles ,except
the electron, proton and neutrinos are unstable. For example, the π+-meson
decays into µ+ and νµ. The muon µ+ decays into e+ , ¯νµ and νe and so on. It

was established during the last thirty years that the weak and electromagnetic
interactions are parts of a electroweak interaction

Quarks take part in strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions. Charged
leptons - in electromagnetic and weak interactions. Neutrinos are exceptional
elementary particles: their electric charge is equal to zero and they take part
only in the weak interaction. The role of neutrinos in physics and astrophysics
is determined by this fact.

The investigation of neutrino processes allows to one obtain important in-
formation on the structure of the weak interaction. The detailed study of the
scattering of high energy neutrinos on nucleons was very important for the es-
tablishment of quark structure of the nucleons. The detection of solar neutrinos
allows one to investigate the internal invisible region of the sun, where solar
energy is produced etc.

Neutrinos are also exceptional particles because of their internal properties.
The masses of the neutrinos are much smaller than the masses of the corre-
sponding family partners. Because of small neutrino masses and the so called
neutrino mixing new neutrino processes neutrino oscillations , periodical tran-
sitions between diﬀerent ﬂavor neutrinos, become possible. Recently evidence
in favor of neutrino oscillations was found in the Super-Kamiokande experiment
in Japan. This discovery and also the discovery of the deﬁcit of solar neutrinos
by the Homestake and other solar neutrino experiments opened a new ﬁeld of
research in neutrino physics: the physics of massive and mixed neutrinos. It
is a general belief that neutrino masses and neutrino mixing angles are deter-
mined by new physics at a mass scale that is much larger than the scale of the
present-day physics (hundreds of GeV).

We will list here the most important discoveries, connected with neutrinos.

1. In 1954-56 in the experiment of F. Reines and C.W. Cowan the electron
neutrino was discovered. For this discovery F. Reines was rewarded by
the Nobel prize in 1994.

2. In 1956 in the experiment of C.S. Wu et al the parity violation in β -decay

was discovered.

3. In 1958 in the experiment of M. Goldhaber et al the helicity of the neutrino
was measured and evidence for the left-handed two-component neutrino
was obtained.

4. In 1962 in the Brookhaven experiment the second type of neutrino, the
muon neutrino, was discovered. In 1988 for this discovery L.Lederman,
J. Steinberger, and M. Schwartz were rewarded the Nobel prize for this
discovery.

5. In 1973 in experiments at the neutrino beam at CERN a new type of weak

interaction, Neutral Currents, was discovered.

6. In the eighties in experiments on the measurement of deep inelastic scatter-
ing of neutrinos on nucleons the quark structure of nucleons was revealed
and established.

7. In 1970 in the experiment of R. Davis et al neutrinos from the sun were de-
tected. In these experiments and also in the GALLEX, SAGE, Kamiokande
and Super-Kamiokande solar neutrino experiments the existence of a solar
neutrino problem (deﬁcit of solar νe’s) was discovered

8. In 1987, in the Kamiokande, IMB and Baksan experiments, neutrinos from
the explosion of the Supernova SN1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud
were detected.

9. In 1998, in the Super-Kamiokande experiment, compelling evidence in

favor of oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos was found.

10. . . .

Here we present at an elementary level only the basics of neutrinos in particle
physics. Those, who like to study this interesting and exciting ﬁeld of physics
must read the original papers and books. Some books and recent reviews are
listed in the bibliography.

2 The history of the neutrino. Pauli

The history of the neutrino started in 1930 with the proposal of W. Pauli. At
that time the electron e− and proton p were considered as the only elementary
particles. It was assumed that the nuclei of all elements heavier than hydrogen
are bound states of electrons and protons.

In the framework of this assumption there were two fundamental problems.
The ﬁrst problem was connected with the spectrum of energies of electrons in
β-decay, the process of the decay of a nucleus with emission of an electron.
If some nucleus A is transferred into another nucleus A′ with the emission
of an electron then, according to the law of the conservation of the energy
and momentum, the energy of the electron must be approximately equal to
MA′ (MA and MA′ are masses of the initial and ﬁnal nucleus). However,
MA −
in experiments on the investigation of β-decay a continuous spectrum of energies
E up to E0

MA′ was observed.

The second problem was the problem of the spin of the nitrogen 7N14 and
other nuclei. The atomic number of 7N14 is equal to 14 and the charge of the
nucleus is equal to 7e . If we assume that nuclei are bound states of protons
and electrons, the 7N14 nucleus is a bound state of 14 protons and 7 electrons.
The spins of the proton and electron are equal to 1/2. Thus, for the spin of
the 7N14 nucleus we will obtain half-integer value. However, from experiments
on the investigation of the spectrum of 7N14 molecules it was known that 7N14
nuclei satisfy Bose statistics and, according to the theorem on the connection
between spin and statistics, the spin of the 7N14 nucleus must be an integer.
This problem was known as the “nitrogen catastrophe”.

MA −

≃

In order to solve these problems Pauli assumed that there exists in nature
a neutral particle with spin 1/2, mass less than the electron mass and with

4

a mean free path much larger than the mean free path of a photon. Pauli
called this particle ”neutron” and he assumed that not only p’s and e’s but also
”neutron”’s are constituents of nuclei. This assumption allowed him to solve
easily the problem of the spin of nitrogen and other nuclei. In fact, if in the
7N14 nucleus there are an odd number of ”neutrons” the spin of this nucleus
will be an integer.

In order to explain β-spectra, Pauli assumed that in the process of β-decay
the electron is emitted together with a ”neutron” which is not detected in an
experiment because of its large mean free path. The energy released in β -decay
is shared between the electron and ”neutron” and as a result the continuous
spectrum of energies of electrons will be observed.

In 1932 the particle that today is called the neutron (the particle with a
mass approximately equal to the mass of the proton and the spin equal to 1/2)
was discovered by J. Chadwick in the nuclear reaction

4He + 9Be

12C + n

(2)

→
Soon after the discovery of the neutron, it was assumed independently by W.
Heisenberg, E. Majorana and D. Ivanenko that the real constituents of nuclei are
protons and neutrons. This assumption allowed to explain all existing nuclear
data. In particular, according to this assumption the nucleus 7N14 is a bound
state of 7 protons and 7 neutrons and the spin of this nucleus must be an integer.
Thus, the “nitrogen catastrophe” disappeared.

3 The ﬁrst theory of β - decay. Fermi

In 1933-34 E. Fermi proposed the ﬁrst theory of the β-decay of nuclei. The Fermi
theory was based on the assumption that nuclei are bound states of protons and
neutrons and on the Pauli hypothesis of the existence of a neutral, light, spin 1/2
particle with a large mean free path. Fermi baptized this particle with the name
neutrino (from Italian neutral, small). Following Pauli, Fermi assumed that in
β- decay the electron is emitted together with the neutrino. The problem was
to understand how an electron-neutrino pair is emitted from a nucleus which is
a bound state of protons and neutrons.

For Fermi it was important an analogy with electrodynamics. According to
quantum electrodynamics in the transition of an electron from an excited state
of an atom into a lower state a photon is emitted. In analogy with this process
Fermi assumed that the electron-neutrino pair is produced in the process of the
quantum transition of a neutron inside a nucleus into a proton

(3)

The ﬁrst theory of β- decay was also built by Fermi in close analogy with
quantum electrodynamics. The main quantity of the quantum ﬁeld theory is
the density of the energy of the interaction, that is called the Hamiltonian of
the interaction.

where the sum over α = 0, 1, 2, 3 is assumed. The electric charge e charac-

The electromagnetic current of protons is given by

α (x) = ¯p(x)γαp(x)

Here γα are the Dirac matrices and p(x) is the proton ﬁeld.
In analogy with (5) Fermi assumed that the Hamiltonian of β- decay had the
form of the scalar product of the proton-neutron and electron-neutrino currents

β
I = GF (¯pγαn)(¯eγαν) + h.c.
Here GF is the constant that characterize the strength of the β -decay inter-
action ( GF is called Fermi constant), n(x) is the ﬁeld of neutrons, e(x) is the
ﬁeld of electrons and ν(x) is the ﬁeld of neutrino.

(6)

H

In quantum ﬁeld theory n(x) is the operator which annihilates the neutron
in the initial state, the operator ¯p(x) creates the proton in the ﬁnal state and
the operators ¯e(x) and ν(x) create the ﬁnal electron and neutrino.

The Fermi theory allows one to describe the β- decay of diﬀerent nuclei. This
theory, however, could not describe all β- decay data. In 1936 Gamov and Teller
generalized the Fermi theory by including in the Hamiltonian additional scalar,
tensor, pseudovector and pseudoscalar terms with four additional interaction
constants.

All β- decay data, existing at that time, could be described by the Fermi-
Gamov-Teller interaction. This was an indirect evidence of the correctness of
the Pauli-Fermi hypothesis of the neutrino. The direct proof of the existence of
the neutrino was obtained only in the beginning of the ﬁfties in the F. Reines
and C.L. Cowan experiment. We will discuss this experiment in the next section.
Let us start with a discussion of the notion of lepton number .

4 Lepton number. The Discovery of the neu-

trino

As is well known, the total electric charge is conserved. This means that only
such processes are allowed in which the sums of the electric charges of the initial
and ﬁnal particles are equal.

6

According to quantum ﬁeld theory every charged particle has its antiparticle,
a particle with the same mass and spin but opposite charge. This general
consequence of quantum ﬁeld theory is conﬁrmed by all existing experimental
data. The antiparticle of the electron is the positron. The electron and the
positron have the same mass and the same spin and the electric charges of the
electron and positron are equal to
e and e, respectively. The existence of the
positron was predicted on the basis of the Dirac theory of the electron. The
positron was discovered by C.D. Anderson in 1932. The antiparticle of the
e and a
proton is the antiproton ¯p, a particle with electric charge equal to
mass equal to the proton mass. The antiproton was discovered in 1955 by O.
Chamberlain, E.G. Segre et al. The antineutron ¯n was discovered in 1956 and
so on.

Except electric charge there exist other conserved charges. One such charge
is the baryon number. The baryon numbers of p and ¯p are equal to 1 and -1,
respectively. The baryon numbers of the π± -mesons, K ±, γ-quantum and other
bosons are equal to zero. Due to the conservation of the baryon number the
proton is a stable particle.

Let us now return to the neutrino. The fact that the neutrino is produced
in β-decay together with an electron suggests that there exist some conserved
quantum number that characterizes these particles. This number is called lep-
ton number. Let us assume that the lepton numbers of the electron and the
neutrino are equal to 1 and lepton numbers of the proton, neutron, photon
and other particles are equal to zero. According to the general theorem, we
mentioned before, the lepton number of the positron is equal to -1 and the an-
tineutrino, the particle with the lepton number equal to -1, must exist. From
the conservation of lepton number it follows that in β-decay together with an
electron an antineutrino is emitted. We will discuss later the experiment in
which evidence in favor of conservation of lepton number was obtained.

Now we will consider the experiment of F. Reines and C.L. Cowan in which

produced in β-decays of diﬀerent nuclei, products of the ﬁssion of U and P u in
a reactor, were detected via the observation of the process

A reactor is a very intense source of antineutrinos: about 2

(7)
1014 antineu-
trinos per second are emitted per kW, generated by the reactor. The power of
a modern reactor is about 4 GW. Thus, about 1021 antineutrinos are emitted
by a reactor per second. The experiment of Reines and Cowan was done at the
Savannah River reactor in USA. The detector in this experiment was a liquid
scintillator loaded with cadmium. The positron, produced in the process (7),
quickly slowed down to rest and annihilated with an electron into two γ-quanta
0.51M eV , moving in opposite directions. These
with energies about E = me ≃
γ-quanta were detected by photomultipliers connected with scintillators.

The neutron produced in the process (7) was slowed down and was captured
by a cadmium nucleus emitting γ-quanta with total energy about 9MeV. These

γ-quanta give a several microseconds delayed signal in the photomultipliers.

The probability of interaction is characterized in physics by the cross section
that has dimension of (length)2. In order to determine the cross section we will
consider the ﬂux of the particles that pass through the matter. Let us consider
the element of the volume of the target with unit area oriented perpendicular
to the momentum ~p (see Fig. 1 ) The number of particles of the target in this

The fact that the neutrino and the antineutrino are diﬀerent particles was
established in the reactor experiment of R. Davis in 1955. As we discussed
earlier, a reactor is a source of antineutrinos. If the lepton number is conserved,

(C2Cl4) liquid was irradiated over a long period of time by antineutrinos from
the reactor. After every run atoms of 37Ar were extracted from the liquid
by purging it with 4He gas and they were put into a low-background Geiger
counter. The γ-quanta produced in the e− capture by 37Ar were detected. No

5 Nonconservation of parity in β-decay. The

two-component neutrino

In 1956 in an experiment by C.S. Wu et al nonconservation of parity in β-decay
was discovered. This was a very important discovery in particle physics that
drastically changed our understanding of the weak interaction and the neutrino.
In order to explain the phenomenon of parity violation we must remember
that there are two types of vectors : (true) vectors and pseudovectors. The
direction of a vector does not depend on the choice of the coordinate system.
The direction of a pseudovector is changed if we change the handedness of the
coordinate system. Typical vectors are momentum, coordinate, electric ﬁeld
etc. Angular momentum, spin, magnetic ﬁeld etc are pseudovectors.

Let us consider two coordinate systems: some right-handed system and a
system with all axes directed opposite to the direction of the axes of the ﬁrst
system. The second system is left-handed one. If some vector ~A has components
Ai (i=1,2,3) in the ﬁrst system, in the second system the coordinates of this
Ai. If ~B is pseudovector with coordinates Bi in the ﬁrst system,
vector will be
then in the second system its coordinates will be Bi (pseudovector changes
direction). The transformation from the ﬁrst system to the second one is called
inversion or parity transformation.

In the Wu et al experiment the β-decay of polarized nuclei 60Co nuclei was
investigated. The polarization (the average value of the spin) is a pseudovector.
Let us consider in a right-handed system the emission of an electron at an angle

Figure 2: The emission of an electron with the momentum ~k by a nucleus with
polarization ~P (right-handed system).

θ between the direction of the polarization of the nucleus and the electron mo-
mentum (see Fig. 2). In the left-handed system the direction of the polarization
is reversed and Fig. 2 corresponds to the emission of an electron at an angle
π - θ (see Fig. 3). The emission of an electron at the angle π - θ in the right-

handed system corresponds to the emission of an electron at the angle θ in the
left-handed system. Thus, right-handed and left-handed systems are equivalent
(the parity is conserved) if the number of electrons emitted (in a ﬁxed system)
at the angles θ and π - θ are equal.

In the experiment of Wu et al a large asymmetry of the emission of the
electrons with respect to the polarization of the nuclei was discovered. It was
observed that electrons are emitted predominantly in the direction opposite to
the direction of the polarization of the nuclei. Thus, it was proved that parity
is not conserved in β-decay (the left-handed and right-handed systems are not

10

equivalent). Later it was shown that parity is not conserved in other weak
processes.

Let us now consider in a right-handed system the emission of a left-handed
neutrino νL, a neutrino with the projection of the spin on the direction of
momentum (helicity) equal to -1 . In the left-handed system the projection of
the spin on the vector of momentum of the neutrino will be equal to +1 (spin
changes direction) . Thus, if parity is conserved the probabilities of emission
of the left-handed neutrino νL and the right-handed neutrino νR (in a ﬁxed
system) must be the same:

w(νL) = w(νR)

(15)

The discovery of the nonconservation of parity in weak interactions means that
these probabilities are not equal.

In 1957 Landau, Lee and Yang and Salam proposed the theory of the two
component neutrino. This theory is based on the assumption that the mass of
the neutrino is equal to zero. According to the theory of the two-component
neutrino for the neutrino there are only two possibilities:

1. the neutrino is a left-handed particle νL and the antineutrino is a right-

handed antiparticle ¯νR;

handed antiparticle ¯νL.

2. the neutrino is a right-handed particle νR and the antineutrino is a left-

In both cases the equality (15) is violated maximally.
The helicity of the neutrino was measured in 1957 in a spectacular exper-
iment by Goldhaber et al. In this experiment neutrinos were produced in the
K-capture

e− + Gd

νe + Sm

(16)

The measurement of the circular polarization of γ-quantum from the decay
of Sm∗ allowed to determine the helicity of the neutrino. The two-component
neutrino theory was conﬁrmed by this experiment and it was established that
the neutrino is a particle with negative helicity. (see Fig. 4).

The discovery of parity nonconservation in the weak interaction and the conﬁr-
mation of the theory of a two-component neutrino led to an enormous progress
in the development of the weak interaction theory (Feynman and Gell-Mann,

weak processes were known. One such processes is µ-capture

The ﬁrst idea of a possible interaction, responsible for the decay (17), was
put forward by B.Pontecorvo. He compared the probabilities of µ-capture and
K-capture of an electron by a nucleus and came to the conclusion that the cor-
responding interaction constants are of the same order. B. Pontecorvo assumed
that there exists a universal weak interaction that includes e - ν and µ- ν pairs.
The idea of µ - e universality was proposed also by G. Puppi, O.Klein and other
authors.

Let us notice that any fermion ﬁeld ψ(x) can be presented as a sum of a

left-handed component ψL(x) and a right-handed component ψR(x)

The fact that the neutrino is a particle with negative helicity means that
the ﬁeld of a neutrino is a left-handed ﬁeld νL. Feynman and Gell-Mann, Mar-
shak and Sudarshan assumed that in the Hamiltonian of the weak interactions
enter left-handed components of all ﬁelds. If we will make this assumption the
Hamiltonian of β-decay takes the very simple form

ticles. We will discuss this experiment in the next section. Now we will continue

Some processes that are described by nondiagonal terms of the Hamiltonian

The predicted cross section of the process (28) is very small and its mea-
surement was a diﬃcult problem. After many years of eﬀorts F. Reines et al
observed the process (28) with reactor antineutrinos.

The detailed investigation of this and another similar processes showed that,
except diagonal terms, in the Hamiltonian of such processes there are additional
neutral current (NC) terms. We will discuss NC later.

There were two alternatives for the weak interaction theory: the current

current theory we described and the theory with an intermediate vector charged
W ± - boson. We will discuss now this last theory. Let us assume that there

In the current

current theory the decay (31) is the process of the ﬁrst
order in perturbation theory in the constant GF and its Feynman diagram is
presented in Fig. 5.
In the theory with the W -boson the decay (31) is the
process of second order in perturbation theory in the constant g. The Feynman
diagram of the process is presented in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 describes the following
chain of transitions: the initial µ− emits the ﬁnal νµ and a virtual W −; the
vector boson propagates in the virtual state; the virtual W −- boson decays
into the ﬁnal e− and ¯νe. At every vertex the conservation of 4-momenta takes
place. This ensures the conservation of energy and momentum for the whole
process. For a free particle the square of the 4-momentum is equal to the square
of its mass. This is not the case for a virtual particle. For the square of the
p′)2 where p and p′ are the
4-momentum of the W -boson we have q2 = (p
4-momenta of µ− and νµ, respectively.
If the mass squared of the W boson

W is much larger than q2 then the propagator of the W -boson (dashed line in

The universal current

current theory of the weak interactions, as well the
theory with the intermediate W -boson, allowed one to describe the data of many
experiments. Nevertheless both theories could not be considered as a ﬁnal theory
of the weak interactions. The main reason was that both theories were not
renormalizable quantum ﬁeld theories. The probability of transitions calculated
in lowest order perturbation theory were in a good agreement with experimental
data. However, the corrections due to higher orders of perturbation theory
cannot be calculated: they contained divergent integrals from which it could not
be found the ﬁnite corrections by the renormalization of masses and interaction
constants. At that time the only known renormalizable theory, that allowed to
calculate the higher order corrections and that was in an excellent agreement
with experiment, was quantum electrodynamics.

The enormous progress in the understanding of weak interactions is con-
nected with the development of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam renormalizable
theory of weak and electromagnetic interactions, the, so called, Standard Model
(SM). We will discuss this theory later.

7 Discovery of the νµ. Electron and muon lepton

numbers

The mass of the muon is approximately 200 times larger than the electron
mass (mµ=105.66 MeV and me=0.51 MeV). From the very beginning of the
investigation of muons the possible decay channel

µ

e + γ

was searched for. No indications in favor of this decay were found. In the ﬁrst
experiments that were done at the end of the forties, for the upper bound of
the ratio R of the probability of the decay µ+
e+ + γ to the probability of
→
the decay µ+
e+ + νe + ¯νµ , which is the main decay channel of muon, it
was found that R < 10−2. At present the upper bound of R is found to be
R < 1.2

→
10−11

If the muon and electron neutrinos are the same particles the process (33)
is possible. At the end of ﬁfties the probability of the decay µ
e + γ was
calculated in a nonrenormalizable theory with W -boson and the estimated value
of the ratio R was larger than existed at that time upper bound (R < 10−8).
This was a possible indication that νe and νµ were diﬀerent particles. It was
necessary, however, to check this in a direct experiment. Such an experiment
was proposed by B. Pontecorvo in 1959 and it was done by L. Lederman, M.
Schwarz, J. Steinberger et al in 1962 in Brookhaven (USA).

The Brookhaven experiment was the ﬁrst experiment that has been done
with neutrinos from an accelerator. The beam of pions in this experiment was
produced by the bombardment of a Be target by 15 GeV protons. Neutrinos
were produced in the decays of pions in a decay channel (about 20 m long). After
the channel there was an iron shielding 13.5 m thick, in which charged particles
were absorbed. After the shielding there was a neutrino detector (about 10
tons).

In the Feynman-Gell-Mann theory the decay (35) is strongly suppressed. In
fact, let us consider this decay in the rest frame of the pion.
In this frame
the e+ and the neutrino are moving in opposite directions. The helicity of the
neutrino is equal to
1. If we neglect the mass of the positron the helicity of
the positron will be equal to +1 (the helicity of the positron in this case will be
the same as the helicity of the antineutrino) Thus, the projection of the total
angular momentum on the direction of the momentum of the positron will be
equal to 1. However, the spin of the pion is equal to zero and the projection of
the initial angular momentum on any direction is equal to zero. Thus, in the

Thus, in decays of pions predominantly muon neutrinos are produced.
In the neutrino detector the processes of the interaction of neutrinos with
nucleons were observed. If νµ and νe are diﬀerent particles, muons produced in

electrons will be observed in the detector.

In the Brookhaven experiment 29 muons were detected. Only 6 electron

electron neutrinos are diﬀerent particles.

To explain the results of the Brookhaven and other experiments, it is nec-
essary to introduce two conserved lepton numbers: the electron lepton number
Le and the muon lepton number Lµ. The electron and muon lepton numbers of
diﬀerent particles are given in the Table 1.

In the ﬁfties a large family of new particles K ±, K 0, ¯K 0, Λ, Σ±,0, Ξ−,0 was
discovered. These particles were called strange particles.

Strange particles are produced in nucleon-nucleon and pion-nucleon collisions

only in pairs. For example, the process

In order to explain the fact of the production of strange particles in pairs
in nucleon-nucleon and pion-nucleon collisions it was necessary to introduce a
conserved quantum number that distinguished strange particles from nonstrange
ones (nucleons, pions and others ). This quantum number was called strangeness

is forbidden (the strangeness of Σ± is equal to -1). All these predictions are in
perfect agreement with experiments.

In 1964 Gell-Mann and Zweig made the crucial assumption that the proton,
the neutron, the pions, the strange particles and all other hadrons are bound
states of quarks. Quarks are particles with spin 1/2, electric charges 2/3 or -1/3
( in the units of the electric charge of the proton) and baryon number equal to
1/3. Gell-Mann and Zweig introduced three quarks, constituents of nonstrange
and strange hadrons: nonstrange quarks u and d with charges 2/3 and -1/3,
respectively and a strange quark s with charge -1/3 and strangeness -1. In the
framework of the quark model the proton is a bound state of two u-quarks and
a d-quark, the π+ -meson is a bound state of a u-quark and a ¯d-antiquark, the
K +-meson is a bound state of a u-quark and a ¯s-antiquark, the Λ- hyperon is
a bound state of a u-quark, a d-quark and a s-quark etc. The correctness of
the quark hypothesis was conﬁrmed by numerous experiments. Later we will
discuss the role of the neutrinos in revealing the quark structure of the nucleon.
If nucleons, pions, strange particles and other hadrons are not elementary
particles and instead are bound states of quarks it is natural to assume that
the fundamental weak interaction is the interaction of leptons, neutrinos and
quarks. In this case the Feynman diagram of the β-decay of the neutron has
the form presented in Fig. 7. Strange particles were included into the current

change strangeness and changes charge by one. The quark current that has
such properties is ¯uLγαdL. The quark current that changes charge by one and
changes strangeness is ¯uLγαsL This current satisﬁes rules I and II automatically.
It was also known from the analysis of experimental data that decays of
strange particles are suppressed with respect to the decays of nonstrange parti-
cles. To take into account this suppression N. Cabibbo introduced an additional
parameter. This parameter is called the Cabibbo angle θC . For the quark weak
current he proposed the following expression

jC
α = 2[cos θC ¯uLγαdL + sin θC ¯uLγαsL]
It was shown that the weak interaction Hamiltonian with such a current
allows one to describe experimental data. From the analysis of the data it was
found that sin θC ≃

is an additional term in the weak current in which the ﬁeld of the new quark
enters. This new quark was called the charm quark (c). The weak currents took

9 Glashow-Weinberg-Salam theory of the elec-

troweak interaction

×

The current
current theory of the weak interaction and the theory with heavy
charged vector W ± bosons to lowest order perturbation theory allowed one
to describe all existing experimental data. However, both theories were only
eﬀective nonrenormalizable theories: in the framework of these theories it was
not possible to calculate corrections due to higher orders of perturbation theory.
The modern renormalizable theory of the weak interaction (S.L. Glashow
(1961), S. Weinberg (1967) and A. Salam (1968)) appeared as a result of uniﬁ-
cation of the weak and electromagnetic interactions into an electroweak interac-
tion .This theory which is called the Standard Model (SM) is one of the greatest
achievements of particle physics in the 20th century. This theory successfully
predicted the existence of families of new hadrons (charmed, bottom and top),
new interactions (Neutral Currents), the existence of W ± and Z 0 bosons, masses
of these particles etc. All predictions of the Standard Model are in perfect agree-
ment with existing experimental data including very precise high-energy data
e− colliders at CERN (Geneva) and
that were obtained in experiments at e+
SLAC (Stanford).

and change correspondingly the unobserved phases of the quark and lepton
ﬁelds. In (55) Λ(x) is an arbitrary function. This invariance is called gauge
invariance and the electromagnetic ﬁeld is an example of a gauge ﬁeld. A gauge
ﬁeld is a vector ﬁeld and corresponding particles, quanta of the gauge ﬁeld, have
spin equal to one.

Weak and electromagnetic interactions are uniﬁed on the basis of the gener-
alized Yang-Mills gauge invariance. The corresponding gauge ﬁelds include not
only the electromagnetic ﬁeld but also ﬁelds of the charged vector particles.

The SM is based on spontaneously broken SU(2)

is the so called neutral current and θW is a parameter (Weinberg or weak angle).
The ﬁrst term of (56) is the charged current (CC) interaction, that we have
discussed before. The second term is a new neutral current (NC) interaction.
Third term is the well known electromagnetic interaction.

Thus, the uniﬁed theory of the electroweak interaction predicted the existence

of a new neutral vector boson Z 0 and a new NC interaction.

This new interaction means the existence of new weak interaction processes.
The ﬁrst processes were discovered in 1973 at CERN. We will discuss this dis-
covery in the next chapter. Charged W ± and neutral Z 0 bosons were discovered
in experiments at the proton-antiproton collider at CERN in 1983.

10 The discovery of neutral currents

Beams of neutrinos (antineutrinos) that can be obtained at accelerators are
mainly the beams of muon neutrinos (antineutrinos) from decays of pions with
a small (a few %) admixture of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos from the
decays of kaons and muons.

We will discuss NC processes that were observed in experiments with the

beam of high energy neutrinos at CERN in the beginning of the eighties.

are possible. The diagram of the neutrino process is presented in Fig. 8. This
Feynman diagram describes the following steps: due to the CC interaction (56)
the initial νµ produces the ﬁnal µ− and virtual W + boson; the virtual W + boson
propagates and is absorbed by a quark inside of the nucleon. As a result the
initial quark is transferred into the ﬁnal quark (the initial nucleon is transferred
into ﬁnal hadron states). If only the ﬁnal muon is observed and the eﬀective
mass of the ﬁnal hadrons is much larger than the mass of the nucleon, the
process is called an inclusive deep inelastic process.

The process (58) is a typical weak interaction process: absorption of a neu-
trino is accompanied by the production of a corresponding charged lepton (like
in β-decay of the neutron, the production of an electron is accompanied by
emission of a ¯νe).

If there is the NC interaction (56) the deep inelastic NC processes

initial νµ produces the ﬁnal νµ and a virtual Z 0 boson. The virtual Z 0 boson
propagates and is absorbed by a quark inside the nucleon. As a result of this
absorption the initial nucleon is transferred in a ﬁnal hadron state.

Such a new weak process was ﬁrst observed at CERN in 1973 in the bubble
chamber ”Gargamelle”. It was found that the ratio of the NC and CC cross
sections is approximately equal to 0.3. Thus, investigation of neutrino processes
allowed one to discover new weak processes. The discovery of NC processes and

The dependence of the cross sections on the variable y is determined by
the helicities of the initial particles. Let us consider the process (71) in the
center of mass system. In this system the total momentum of the initial (ﬁnal)
particles is equal to zero . The helicity of the neutrino is equal to
1 and the
helicity of the antiquark ¯u is equal to 1 (we neglect quark masses). Thus, the
projection of the total angular momentum on the direction of the momentum
of the neutrino is equal to 2
1. Let us consider the emission of a
µ− in the backward direction. This case corresponds to y = 1 (the energy, that
is transferred to the hadrons, is maximal). The helicity of the µ− is equal to
1 and the projection of the total angular momentum on the direction of the
−
momentum of the neutrino is equal to +1 in this case. Thus, the emission of
the µ− in the backward direction is forbidden by conservation of total angular
y)2 dependence of the contribution of
momentum. This corresponds to the (1

In the case of the process (70) the projections of the total angular momentum
on the direction of the momentum of the neutrinos are equal to zero for the initial
and ﬁnal particles. Thus, emission of µ− in backward direction is allowed. This
corresponds to the absence of an y-dependence in the contribution of quarks to
the cross section (73).

In neutrino experiments the target nuclei are usually nuclei with approx-
imately equal numbers of protons and neutrons. If we take into account the
contribution of only u and d quarks, for the cross sections, averaged over p and
n, we obtain the following expression

Here u(x) is the density of u-quarks in the proton (d-quarks in the neutron) and
so on.

The expressions (73), (74) and (77) were obtained in the so- called naive
quark-parton model in which interactions between quarks are neglected. If we
take into account the interaction of quarks with gluons in this case the expres-
sions for the cross sections have the same form, but the quark and antiquark

From the relations (78) it follows that at y = 0 the cross sections of the
processes (66) and (67) must be equal. This is conﬁrmed by the data of the
neutrino experiments. From the data of the CDHS experiment at CERN with
neutrino energies in the range 30 < E < 200GeV it was found that

Thus, neutrino experiments proved that not all the nucleon momentum is

12 Neutrino masses. Introduction

From all existing data it follows that the interaction of neutrinos with matter
is given by the Standard Model, However, neutrino masses, neutrino magnetic
moments and other fundamental neutrino properties are basically unknown. We
now come to the problem of the neutrino masses and neutrino mixing.

The brief history of neutrino masses is the following. Pauli introduced the
neutrino as a particle with a mass (as a constituent of nuclei). He thought
that the mass of the neutrino is less than the electron mass. Fermi and Perrin
proposed the ﬁrst method of measuring the neutrino mass based on the mea-
surement of the shape of the high energy part of the β-decay spectrum. This
part of the spectrum is due to the emission of a neutrino with small energy and
eﬀects of the neutrino mass in that part of the spectrum is the most pronounced.
In experiments on the determination of the neutrino mass by the this method,
the decay of tritium

3H

3He + e− + ¯νe

→

is usually investigated.

In the ﬁrst experiments that were done in the forties no eﬀects of a neutrino
mass were seen. From these experiments it was found that the upper bound of
the neutrino mass is much less than the electron mass:

(85)

(86)

With the improvement of experimental technique this upper bound became
much smaller and at the time, when the parity violation in β-decay was discov-
ered, the upper bound of the neutrino mass was about 100 eV.

mν < 500 eV.

29

The theory of the two-component neutrino (Landau, Lee and Young and
Salam) was based on the assumption that the neutrino mass is equal to zero.
After the success of this theory during many years there was a general belief
that all neutrinos are massless particles. The Glashow-Weinberg-Salam theory
was also based on this assumption.

In 1957-58 B. Pontecorvo considered the possibility of a small but nonzero
neutrino masses. The only known massless particle is the photon. There is a
symmetry reason for the photon to be massless-the gauge invariance of quantum
electrodynamics. B. Pontecorvo put attention that there is no such a principle
in the case of the neutrino. He showed that, if states of neutrinos produced
in weak decays are superpositions of the states of neutrinos with small masses,
neutrino oscillations will take place in the beams of the neutrinos in vacuum,
¯K 0 oscillations. B. Pontecorvo showed that the
similar to well known K 0
search for neutrino oscillations is a very sensitive method of the measurement
of small neutrino masses.

→

In 1962 at the time of the Brookhaven experiment Maki, Nakagawa and
Sakata proposed some model in which the nucleon was considered as a bound
state of some vector particle and massive neutrinos. They assumed that the
ﬁelds of νe and νµ are linear orthogonal combinations of the ﬁelds of the massive
neutrinos and pointed out that in such a case transition of muon neutrinos into
electron neutrinos becomes possible.

In the seventies in Dubna (Russia) and other places in the framework of the
SM the neutrino masses and mixing were considered as a phenomena analogous
to the Cabibbo-GIM quark mixing. The neutrino oscillations between two types
of neutrinos were discussed and the diﬀerent experiments on the search for
neutrino oscillations were proposed.

At that time the majority of physicists still believed that neutrinos are mass-
less particles. The opinion about the neutrino masses drastically changed in the
end of the seventies with the appearance of models beyond the Standard Model
such as models of Grand Uniﬁcation. These models are based on large symme-
try groups and ﬁelds of neutrinos enter into the same multiplets of the groups as
the ﬁelds of leptons and quarks. A mechanism of the generation of the masses
of quarks and leptons generally provides also masses to the neutrinos. The neu-
trino masses and mixing started to be considered as phenomena connected with
physics beyond the Standard Model.

In the eighties special experiments on the search for neutrino oscillation
started. The problem of the neutrino masses and neutrino oscillations became
the most challenging and important problems of neutrino physics.

13 Discovery of the τ -lepton, b and t-quarks.

The number of ﬂavor neutrinos

Up to now we have considered four leptons: the two charged leptons e and µ
and the two neutrinos νe and νµ. In 1975 the third heavy charged lepton τ with

1/3 must exist. These quarks were called the top
quarks with charges 2/3 and
and bottom. The real triumph of the Standard model was the discovery of the
bottom particles in the eighties and top quark in the nineties.

Here V is the unitary matrix that is called the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
matrix. The elements of this matrix are well- known from the data of numerous
experiments.

How many families of quarks and leptons exist in Nature? The investigation
of neutrino processes allowed to answer this fundamental question. As we have
seen, the number of families is equal to the number of neutrino types (neutrino
e− colliders
ﬂavors). This number was measured in experiments at the e+
at SLC (Stanford) and LEP (CERN). From the data of these experiments the
probability (width) of the decay

was determined. The width of the decay (89) is proportional to the number
of neutrino ﬂavors nν. From the data of the recent LEP experiments it was
found that

±

We will now assume that the neutrinos are massive and the lepton numbers

of the ﬁelds of neutrinos with deﬁnite masses

Here U is unitary matrix (U U + = 1) and νi are the ﬁelds of neutrinos with

Before we will come to the discussion of the consequences of neutrino mixing
(92) let us notice that there are two types of particles with spin 1/2: Dirac
particles and Majorana particles.

Dirac particles possess some conserved charges. Every Dirac particle has
an antiparticle, the particle with the same mass and spin but opposite charge.
The electron and the proton are examples of Dirac particles. Corresponding
antiparticles are the positron and the antiproton.

Other possible particles with spin 1/2 are Majorana particles . All charges
of the Majorana particles are equal to zero. Thus, a Majorana particle and a
Majorana antiparticle are identical. Up to now Majorana particles were not
observed. The massive neutrinos and neutralinos, particles predicted by models
of supersymmetry, are possible candidates. Neutral bosons such as the photon,
π0 and other are well known neutral particles with integral spin that are identical
to their antiparticles.

There are two possibilities of the violation of the lepton number conservation

low:

I. The lepton numbers Le, Lµ and Lτ are violated separately but the total

lepton number L = Le + Lµ + Lτ is conserved

L = const

X

(93)

In this case the neutrinos νi are Dirac particles that possess lepton number
L = 1. The lepton number of the antineutrinos ¯νi is equal to
1. The Dirac
neutrino masses and neutrino mixing can be generated in the framework of the
SM by the same mechanism that is responsible for the generation of the masses
and mixing of quarks.

−

II. There are no conserved lepton numbers.

32

In this case the massive neutrinos νi are Majorana particles. The Majorana
neutrino masses and mixing can be generated only in the framework of the
models beyond the SM.

If massive neutrinos are Majorana particles there exist a plausible mechanism
of the generation of neutrino masses that connect the smallness of neutrino
masses with the violation of lepton numbers at a mass scale M that is much
larger than the masses of leptons and quarks. This is the so-called see-saw
mechanism. The masses of neutrinos are given in the see-saw case by the relation

(mi

M ≪

mi
f

mi ≃

(i = 1, 2, 3) .

(94)

where mi
f is the mass of the lepton or quark in the ith family (i = 1, 2, 3). Let us
notice that in the see-saw case the neutrino masses satisfy the hierarchy relation

that follows from the hierarchy of masses of the leptons (quarks) of the diﬀerent
families.

The relation (97) is based on the assumption that the mass diﬀerences of
neutrinos are so small that they cannot be revealed in the experiments on the
investigation of processes of neutrino production and detection. The neutrino
mass diﬀerences can be revealed in the neutrino oscillation experiments, special
experiments with a large macroscopic distance between the neutrino source and
the neutrino detector.

Let us notice that for the comparison of neutrino oscillation theory with ex-
perimental data it is necessary to average the corresponding theoretical expres-
sion for transition probabilities over the neutrino energy spectrum, the region
where neutrinos were produced and so on. As a result of such averaging, the
cosine term in the expressions (107) usually disappears.

16 Experiments on the search for neutrino os-

cillations

There are at present data of numerous experiments on the search for neutrino
oscillations. The important indications in favor of the neutrino masses and mix-
ing were found in the solar neutrino experiments. The compelling evidence in
favor of neutrino oscillations was obtained recently in the Super-Kamiokande
νe os-
atmospheric neutrino experiment. Some indications in favor of νµ →
cillations were found also in the Los Alamos accelerator neutrino experiment.
In many experiments with accelerator and reactor neutrinos no indications in
favor of neutrino oscillations were found. We will ﬁrst discuss the solar neutrino
experiments.

16.1 The solar neutrino experiments

The energy of the sun is generated in the reactions of the thermonuclear pp and
CN O cycles. From the thermodynamical point of view the energy of the sun is
produced in the transition of four protons and two electrons into 4He and two
neutrinos

Thus, the generation of energy of the sun is accompanied by the emission of

4 p + 2 e−

4He + 2 νe ,

(112)

electron neutrinos

The main sources of solar neutrinos are the reactions that are listed in Ta-
ble 3. In this table the maximal neutrino energies and neutrino ﬂuxes, predicted
by the Standard Solar Model (SSM), are also given.

36

As it seen from Table 3, solar neutrinos are mainly low energy pp neutrinos.
According to SSM the ﬂux of the medium energy monochromatic 7Be neutrinos
is about 10 % of the total ﬂux. The ﬂux of the high energy 8B neutrinos is
only about 10−2 % of the total ﬂux. The 8B neutrinos give, however, the main
contribution to the event rates of experiments with high energy threshold.

The results of the ﬁve underground solar neutrino experiments are avail-
able at present. In the pioneering radiochemical experiment by R. Davis et al
(Homestake mine, USA), a tank ﬁlled with 615 tons of C2Cl4 liquid is used
as a target. Solar neutrinos are detected in this experiment by a radiochemi-
cal method, proposed by B.Pontecorvo in 1946, through the observation of the
reaction

νe + 37Cl

e− + 37Ar

(113)
The radioactive atoms of 37Ar are extracted from the tank by purging it
with 4He gas. The atoms of 37Ar are placed in a low background proportional
counter in which the process

the volume that contains 2.2

After 2 months of exposition about 16 atoms of the 37 Ar are extracted from
1030 atoms of 37Cl!
The solar neutrinos have been observed in the Davis experiment for about
30 years. For the observed event rate QCl, averaged over 108 runs, the following
value was obtained

×

0.16
(115)
where 1 SNU = 10−36 events/atom s. The observed event rate is about three
times less than the rate predicted by the SSM

(116)

The minimal neutrino energy at which the process (113) become possible
(the threshold of the process) is equal to Eth = 0.81 MeV. Thus, the low energy
pp neutrinos are not detected in the Davis experiment. The most important
contribution to the event rate comes from the high energy 8B neutrinos. About
15% of the events are due to 7Be neutrinos.

In the radiochemical GALLEX (Italy) and SAGE (Russia) experiments the

solar νe’s are detected through the observation of the reaction

νe + 71Ga

e− + 71Ge

(117)
In the GALLEX experiment the target is a tank with 30.3 tons of the 71Ga
in the gallium-chloride solution. In the SAGE experiment a metallic 71Ga target

The threshold of the process (117) is Eth = 0.23MeV. Thus, neutrinos from
all solar neutrino reactions are detected in these experiments (according to the

In the Super-Kamiokande experiment a large 50 ktons water-Cerenkov de-
tector is used. The inner surface of the detector is covered with 11146 large pho-
tomultipliers in which the Cerenkov light from the recoil electrons is detected.
About 14 neutrino events per day are observed by the Super-Kamiokande exper-
iment (in the previous Kamiokande experiment one neutrino event per day was
detected). At high energies the direction of the momentum of the recoil elec-
trons is practically the same as the direction of the momentum of the neutrinos.
Thus, the measurement of the direction of the momenta of the electrons allows
one to detect events induced by neutrinos coming from the sun. The recoil
electron energy threshold is rather large (7 MeV in the Kamiokande experiment
and 5.5 MeV in the Super-Kamiokande experiment). Thus, only the 8B neu-
trinos are detected in these experiments. From the results of the Kamiokande
and Super-Kamiokande experiments the following values of the solar neutrinos
ﬂuxes were obtained, respectively

The measured ﬂuxes are about 1/2 of the predicted one by the SSM

Thus, from the results of all solar neutrino experiments it follows that the
ﬂuxes of the solar νe’s on the earth in diﬀerent ranges of energies are signiﬁcantly
smaller than the predicted ﬂuxes. This deﬁcit constitutes the solar neutrino
problem.

Neutrino oscillations is the most plausible explanation of the solar neutrino
problem. If neutrinos are massive and mixed, the solar νe’s on the way to the
earth can be transfered into other neutrinos (νµ and/or ντ ). However, in the

and the Super-Kamiokande experiments. However, cross section of νµ(ντ )

e scattering, and therefore,
scattering is about 1/6 of the cross section of νe −
the main contribution to the event rate of these experiments also comes from
νe’s. Thus, if there are neutrino oscillations, the event rates detected in the
solar neutrino experiments will be less than the expected ones.

Solar neutrinos, produced in the central zone of the sun, on their way to the
earth pass through a large amount of matter of the sun. At some values of the
mixing parameters eﬀects of the coherent interactions of neutrinos with matter
can enhance signiﬁcantly the probability of the transition of solar νe’s into other
states.

The refraction index of the neutrinos in matter depends on the amplitude
of elastic scattering of neutrinos in the forward direction. Both the CC and
e scattering.
NC interactions give contribution to the amplitude of elastic νe −
The amplitude of the elastic νµ(ντ )
e scattering is determined only by the
NC interaction. Thus, the refraction indexes of the νe and νµ(ντ ) are diﬀerent.
Hence, when a neutrino wave propagates through matter, the ﬂavor content of
the neutrino state is changing. Under the condition

−

∆m2 cos 2θ = 2√2GFρeE

(123)

where ρe is the electron number-density, the combined eﬀect of neutrino masses
and mixing and coherent neutrino interaction in matter can enhance signiﬁcantly
the probability of the transition of νe’s into other states. This is so-called
Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein eﬀect (MSW). In the sun matter MSW eﬀect can

All existing solar neutrino data can be described, if we assume that there is

the SSM. In such a case there are only two free parameters: ∆m2 and sin2 2θ.

tions, are measured. No sizable distortion of the spectrum was observed in this
experiment.

In the Super-Kamiokande experiment the day-night asymmetry was also

of the day-night asymmetry allows in a model-independent way to measure

If solar neutrino ﬂuxes from diﬀerent sources are considered as free param-
eters and it is assumed that the νe transition probability is equal to one in
this case from the analysis of the data of diﬀerent solar neutrino experiments it
follows that the ﬂux of 8Be neutrinos must be strongly suppressed. This conse-
quence of the general analysis of existing solar neutrino data will be checked in
the future BOREXINO experiment that is planned to start in 2002 in the un-
derground Laboratory Gran Sasso (Italy). In this experiment mainly medium
energy 8Be neutrinos will be detected through the observation of the ν

16.2 The atmospheric neutrino experiments

recently by the atmospheric neutrino experiments. The main source of atmo-
spheric neutrinos is the following chain of the decays

the pions being produced in the interaction of cosmic rays with nuclei in the
earth’s atmosphere. At relatively small energies (
1 GeV ) the ratio of the
muon and electron neutrinos is equal to 2. At higher energies this ratio becomes
larger than 2 (not all muons have enough time to decay in the atmosphere).
The ratio can be predicted, however, with the accuracy better than 5 %. The
absolute ﬂuxes of the electron and muon neutrinos are predicted at present
with accuracy 25-30 %. The results of the atmospheric neutrino experiments
are usually presented in the form of the double ratio R of the ratio of the
observed muon and electron events to the ratio of the muon and electron events
calculated by Monte Carlo method under the assumption that there are no
neutrino oscillations.
In all latest atmospheric neutrino experiments it was
found that the ratio R is signiﬁcantly smaller than one:

The fact that the double ratio R is less than one is a model-independent

indication in favor of the disappearance of νµ (or appearance of νe).

Compelling evidence in favor of the disappearance of νµ was obtained re-
cently by the Super-Kamiokande experiment. In this experiment a signiﬁcant
zenith angle dependence of the number of high-energy muon events was found
(the zenith angle θ is the angle between the vertical direction and the neu-
trino momentum). The angle θ is connected with the distance that neutri-
nos pass from the production region to the detector. Down-going neutrinos
(cos θ = 1) pass a distance of about 20 km. The distance that up-going neutri-
nos (cos θ =

1) travel is about 13000 km.

The possible source of the zenith angle dependence of the numbers of atmo-
spheric neutrino events is the magnetic ﬁeld of the earth. However, at energies
larger than 1 GeV the eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld of the earth is small and the
numbers of down-going and up-going νµ ( νe) must be equal.

17 Neutrinoless double β-decay

We have discussed in the previous sections neutrino oscillation experiments that
allow to obtain information on a very small neutrino mass squared diﬀerences.

trinos can be obtained from experiments on the investigation of neutrinoless

Here (A, Z) is some even-even nucleus. In the experiments neutrinoless dou-
ble β-decay of 76Ge, 136Xe, 130Te, 100Mo and other nuclei are searched for. The
process (134) is allowed, if the total lepton number L is not conserved, i.e.
if
massive neutrinos are Majorana particles.

In the framework of the standard CC weak interaction with Majorana neu-
trino mixing neutrinoless double β-decay is second order in the Fermi constant
GF process with a virtual neutrino. The matrix element of the process is pro-
portional to the eﬀective Majorana mass

There are many experiments in which neutrinoless double β-decay of diﬀer-

found up to now. A very stringent lower bound on the life-time was obtained
in the Heidelberg-Moscow experiment in which the neutrinoless double β-decay
of the 76Ge was search for:

18 Neutrino masses from experiments on the

measurement of the β-spectrum of tritium

The ﬁrst method of measuring neutrino mass was proposed in the classical paper
by Fermi on the β-decay. The method consists in the precise measurement of
the end-point part of the β-spectrum, the part of the spectrum that is most
sensitive to the small neutrino mass.

Usually, for the determination of neutrino mass by this method the β-

spectrum of the decay of the tritium

19 Conclusion

The neutrinos play very a important role in particle physics and astrophysics.
They have enormous penetration properties and they give us a unique possibility
to investigate the internal structure of the nucleon, the internal invisible region
of the sun where solar energy is produced etc.

The neutrinos are exceptional particles as for their internal properties. The
neutrino masses are many orders of magnitude smaller than the masses of their
family partners (electron, muon, tau). Because of the smallness of the neutrino
masses new physical phenomenon, neutrino oscillations, the periodical transi-
tions between diﬀerent ﬂavor neutrinos in the vacuum or in matter, becomes
possible. The evidence for this phenomenon, that was predicted many years
ago, was obtained recently by the Super-Kamiokande collaboration in Japan.
The investigation of the neutrino oscillations that is going on all over the world
is a new ﬁeld of research in particle physics and astrophysics.

The investigation of the neutrino oscillations, neutrinoless double β-decay,
β-spectrum of 3H-decay and other eﬀects will allow us to obtain important
information on the neutrino masses, element of the neutrino mixing matrix and
the nature of massive neutrinos (Dirac or Majorana?).

The exceptional smallness of the neutrino masses requires a special expla-
nation. There is a general belief that small neutrino masses are generated by
new interactions beyond the Standard Model. One of the plausible explana-
tion of the small neutrino masses is connected with a violation of the lepton
number at a mass scale that is much larger than the scale of the violation of
102 GeV that determine masses of the leptons,
electroweak symmetry MEW ≃
quarks and W ±, Z 0 bosons. If this explanation is correct the massive neutrinos
are truly neutral Majorana particles. All other fundamental fermions (leptons
and quarks) are charged Dirac particles.

It is a pleasure for me to thank Tommy Ohlsson for careful reading of the
paper and useful discussions and Michael Ratz for the help in the preparation
of the ﬁgures.

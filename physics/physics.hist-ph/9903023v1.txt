The Road to Stueckelberg’s Covariant
Perturbation Theory as Illustrated by
Successive Treatments of Compton Scattering

J. Lacki∗, H. Ruegg†and V. L. Telegdi‡

Abstract

We review the history of the road to a manifestly covariant per-
turbative calculus within quantum electrodynamics from the early
semi-classical results of the mid-twenties to the complete formalism
of Stueckelberg in 1934. We chose as our case study the calculation
of the cross-section of the Compton eﬀect. We analyse Stueckelberg’s
paper extensively. This is our ﬁrst contribution to a study of his fun-
damental contributions to the theoretical physics of twentieth century.

1 Introduction

One often considers the birth of quantum electrodynamics (QED) as one of
the most exciting and challenging chapters of the history of modern physics.
Though not a fundamentally new theory, like general relativity or quantum
mechanics, QED, as an eﬀort to obtain a consistent relativistic treatment
of the interaction of matter with radiation, gave birth to most fertile con-
cepts of modern microphysics such as quantum ﬁelds, gauge symmetries and

renormalization techniques3. These developments have already been covered
in many excellent studies and publications4. There is however another as-
pect of the history of QED, equally symptomatic of a deﬁnite tendency that
culminated with the widely used Feynman diagrams. We deal with a theory
deﬁned, maybe for the ﬁrst time in such explicit terms, by its associated
perturbation expansion. Indeed, most of the tools and techniques used were
introduced in an attempt to give theoretical meaning and practical usefulness
to the successive terms of perturbative series.

Although classical electrodynamics had existed and had been success-
fully applied for more than half a century, its closed-form fundamental laws
(Maxwell equations) were not adequate to yield a fully successful quantum
version by a straightforward process of quantization. Many diﬃculties had
to be overcome. On the one hand, there was the need to accommodate
the continuous ﬁeld equations to the fundamentally discontinuous quantum
processes of energy and momentum exchange between photons and matter
particles. On the other hand, one faced the diﬃculties, already present in
the classical theory, of formulating a consistent relativistic theory of several
interacting particles.

The ﬁrst step on the road to a full-ﬂedged quantum theory was the quan-
tization of the radiation ﬁeld itself. The 1927 papers of Dirac opened the
way. He showed how to quantize the radiation ﬁeld as an assembly of non-
interacting bosons and proposed a perturbation scheme enabling one to deal
with its time-dependent coupling to matter. His method of quantization
made possible the ﬁrst quantum treatment of emission-absorption processes
and provided a decisive step towards a genuine quantum theory of photon-
electron interaction. Until the advent of the modern S-matrix approach
within quantum ﬁeld theory5 at the end of the forties, the spirit of this
method was very inﬂuential6, supplemented by Dirac’s equally famous rela-
tivistic electron equation, as the main theoretical tool of investigation in the
study of matter-radiation interaction.

Following Dirac’s pioneering theory, one could distinguish several lines
of research. The main one dealt with a consistent formulation of a rela-

physics.

tivistic theory of particles interacting with and through the radiation ﬁeld.
Before the advent of quantum mechanics, the problem was tackled in a ”cor-
respondence principle” way as illustrated for instance by the achievement of
Kramers and Heisenberg (1925)7. The quantum evolution equations of ma-
trix and wave mechanics were the foundations of semi-classical treatments,
like those of Dirac (1926b and 1927a), of Gordon (1926) (for spin 0 parti-
cles), and of Klein and Nishina (1929) (spin 1/2 electrons). The fundamental
insights of Dirac (Dirac 1932) enabled further progress, resulting in the in-
teraction picture (Dirac, Fock, Podolsky 1932, see however already Dirac
1927b) and the multiple-time formalism. Of course, the problem couldn’t
ﬁnd a complete solution until it was realized that both radiation and mat-
ter had to be expressed as quantized ﬁelds. The point-particle singularities
were then ”dissolved” into ﬁeld excitations and the problem of coupling con-
sistently matter to radiation transformed into that of ﬁeld-ﬁeld coupling.
This modern standpoint was initiated by the work of Pauli and Heisenberg
(Heisenberg and Pauli 1929 and 1930) and preceded by Jordan’s insights
(Jordan 1927a,b). Along this fundamental thread, one had to provide a
systematic way of generating and organizing the successive terms of the per-
turbative series without loosing the manifest relativistic invariance and other
symmetries (gauge invariance) characteristic of the full equations. We shall
focus our attention on these issues, leaving aside the further problem of the
inﬁnities arising in the higher-order processes, such as the self-energy or vac-
uum polarization, which constitute another important chapter of the history
of QED8.

In what follows we shall attempt to sketch an outline of the various stages
in the attainment of a manifestly covariant perturbation calculus of QED
processes. As an illustration for our study we shall choose the case of Comp-
ton and related eﬀects to lowest order9. Here, by Compton eﬀect, we mean
mainly the scattering of a photon on a free electron; indeed in the twenties,

chapter 16, Schweber1994, chapter 1,2; Brown 1993. For personal recollections of actors
see for example Wentzel 1960 and Weisskopf 1983.

9For a complete historical study of the Compton eﬀect, see Stuewer 1975. The impor-
tance of these processes was pointed out by Brown (1993), who after discussing divergence
diﬃculties makes the following comment: ”What really established QED as a usable theory
of processes at high energy (as well at the lower energies available in the laboratory) was
the calculation of the so-called ”shower processes”: bremsstrahlung (i.e. continuous x-ray
production), pair production by a high-energy photon in the Coulomb ﬁeld of a nucleus,
and electron pair annihilation [and of course Compton scattering].”, p. 9. A historical
account of the related experiments is given in Cassidy 1981.

the Compton eﬀect covered also the case of the scattering of high-energy pho-
tons on bound electrons, where the latter could be considered as free. We
shall discuss the early results of Dirac, Gordon, and Klein and Nishina, then
shall consider the generalized Klein-Nishina type formulas of Waller (1930)
and Tamm (1930), and ﬁnally shall end up with the results of Stueckelberg
(1934). The contribution of Stueckelberg shall be examined in closer detail,
as we believe it constitutes the ﬁrst complete and easily generalizable instance
of a manifest relativistically invariant perturbative calculus. It is of inter-
est in many respects, both technical and epistemological. The ”modernity”
of this contribution is striking and characteristic of Stueckelberg’s original
turn of mind. From this point of view, the present study can be consid-
ered as a ﬁrst stage in an attempt at drawing the attention of historians to
Stueckelberg’s achievements during those years.

Our choice of the landmarks on the road towards Stueckelberg’s 1934
paper is accordingly motivated by the need to illustrate both the key chal-
lenges as well as the main theoretical inputs which motivated Stueckelberg’s
approach. Thus, we start with a brief reminder of the ”infamous” Bohr,
Kramers and Slater proposal (Bohr, Kramers, Slater 1924), which can be
considered as the ﬁnal expression of the fundamental impotence of the ”old”
quantum physics as regards the emerging problem of matter-radiation in-
teraction followed by a brief discussion of the Heisenberg-Kramers disper-
sion formulas. We next present two early Dirac papers on the Compton
eﬀect ﬁrst treated with the matrix formalism and then with wave mechan-
ics, a progression characteristic of the whole of quantum studies of the time
(Dirac 1926b, 1927a). Gordon’s 1926 contribution is crucial in understand-
ing the Klein-Nishina 1929 paper, both papers sharing the same strategy
and scope. Dirac’s 1927 ﬁeld quantization and time-dependent perturba-
tion theory (Dirac 1926c, 1927b) are the essential techniques used subse-
quently by Waller and Tamm. Stueckelberg’s 1934 paper took also advantage
from Dirac’s reﬂection (Dirac 1932) on the backreaction problem, which lead
among other thing to the interaction picture of the later joint work of Fock,
Dirac and Podolsky. We end up the paper with a discussion of the little
interest met by Stueckelberg’s work at his time.

Throughout the paper we have tried to adopt a uniﬁed (modern) notation
with some exceptions when there was a danger of betraying the spirit of the
original paper. We report in the footnotes the most important changes with
respect to the original versions, and discuss our conventions in the Appendix

2 Preliminaries: the end of the old quantum
theory, the BKS crisis and the Heisenberg-
Kramers dispersion formula

2.1

Introduction

By the mid-twenties, the old quantum theory of the founding fathers, Planck,
Einstein, Bohr and Sommerfeld was spectacularly extended by powerful new
techniques which provided a formal framework for many of the ”quantum
rules” used, with much brio, in the blossoming ﬁeld of atomic physics. Quan-
tum mechanics, ﬁrst in its matrix form, shortly followed by the wave version,
was born. It oﬀered the promise of a uniﬁed treatment of many problems and
a way of solving long-standing diﬃculties. Indeed, in spite of undisputed suc-
cesses of the old theory, persistent diﬃculties were taking increasing impor-
tance. Thus, after Bohr’s successful theory of the atom, there remained the
problem of explaining the dynamics of quantum transitions between atomic
levels and more generally that of the interaction of radiation with matter.
The classical continuous wave picture of radiation, after being challenged by
Einstein in 1905 with his light-quantum interpretation of the photo-electric
eﬀect , was again questioned in 1922 this time by Compton who studied X-
ray scattering. It was known since the work of D. C. H. Florance in 1910
and J. A. Gray in 1913 that the secondary radiation produced by irradiat-
ing a metal with gamma rays is ”softer” (less penetrating) than the primary
radiation. After his experiments in 1921, Compton, who realized that there
was a shift of frequency, thought that a wave-model interpretation could still
hold (Compton 1921). Facing the evidence of his subsequent experiments,
he progressively changed his mind and proposed an explanation (Compton
1923) in terms of collision processes between individual electrons and light-
quanta10. Cloud-chamber experiments by C. T. R. Wilson and W. Bothe
(Wilson 1923, Bothe 1923) showed tracks of the recoil electrons which were
consistent with the light-quantum hypothesis11. Still, the latter was far from
being accepted and several ﬁrst-rank physicists kept trying to accommodate
a continuous wave type explanation to the discrete reality, using more or less
modiﬁed forms of classical electrodynamics.

One of the ﬁercest opponents to the light-quantum nature of radiation
was Niels Bohr.
In an attempt to push the old wave scheme to its lim-
its, Bohr, Kramers and Slater (BKS) published a paper (Bohr Kramers and

Slater 1924)12 where they followed up on an earlier idea of Slater (Slater
1922). The latter suggested to view the atom in a stationary state as an as-
sembly of ”virtual” harmonic oscillators with eigenfrequencies determined by
the transitions between stationary states. In genuine ”theoretical despair”,
Bohr, Kramers and Slater went as far as to question the validity of the en-
ergy conservation principle at the level of individual atomic processes, and
replaced it by a milder version, holding only at the statistical level, a move
apparently due to Bohr and Kramers and originally rejected by Slater. Part
of Bohr’s motivation was then to save the wave model of radiation, which he
believed essential for the explanation of the Compton eﬀect, since the latter
implied an increase of the wave-length, the measurement of which presup-
posed, in his opinion, the wave picture13. Secondary radiation thus resulted
in his view from a continuous process of emission of coherent waves from
each illuminated atom.

The empirical refutation of the BKS proposal came quickly. Indeed, in
the BKS theory, the electron recoil (which paradoxically still made sense in
this approach) would occur with ﬁnite probability in any direction, whereas
according to the light-quantum hypothesis, it would strictly depend on that
of the incident radiation. The validity of the conservation principles in the in-
dividual collisions was established beyond doubt by Bothe and Geiger (1925)
on one hand, and by Compton and Simon (1925) on the other.

Be it as it may, Compton scattering vindicated the power of conservation
principles and joined the ranks of other well-established processes involving
light quanta and electrons, such as Bremsstrahlung, or the photo-electric
eﬀect, which were all in 1924 still lacking a fully satisfactory quantum treat-
ment because of the absence of a genuine quantum starting point.

2.2 The Heisenberg-Kramers dispersion relations and

the ﬁrst attempts

In the quest for a quantitative approach, an important step was however
taken by Kramers and Heisenberg [Kramers and Heisenberg 1924] who es-
tablished a dispersion formula describing the features of the radiation reemit-
ted by an atom after illumination by primary radiation14. The authors were
able to achieve a quantitative result but their method excluded the possibil-
ity to be applied to more energetic regimes, those characteristic for instance

reader will also ﬁnd in Max Dresden’s (1987) biography of Kramers an insightful account
of this and other episodes of the old quantum theory.

of light scattering oﬀ unbound electrons. Beyond its intrinsic interest, the
Heisenberg-Kramers dispersion formula became un passage oblig´e in every
subsequent study, a standard to be reattained and a testing ground for any
new technique, only to be replaced in this role by the Klein-Nishina for-
mula at the end of the twenties. The approach of Kramers and Heisenberg
was based purely on the correspondence principle and constitutes a brilliant
example of the surprisingly powerful method the latter constituted in such
expert hands. Together with similar approaches by Smekal 1923, Breit 1926,
Wentzel 1927, and others, it can be considered as the outmost excursion
of the old theory into a territory which could be fully explored only with
radically new tools which were soon to come.

The Kramers-Heisenberg paper starts with an analysis of the then cur-
rent standpoint on the problem of dispersion of radiation by atoms. After
recalling the usual treatment of the coherent secondary radiation, understood
(classically) as the result of the harmonic motion of the electrons excited by
the external radiation, the authors mention the diﬃculty of analyzing this ef-
fect within the quantum theoretical picture of electronic transitions between
stationary states:

We are thus faced with the problem of describing the scatter-
ing and dispersion eﬀects of the atom in terms of the quantum
theoretical picture of atomic structure. According to this picture,
the appearance of a spectral line is not linked with the presence
of elastically oscillating electrons, but with transitions from one
stationary state to another. Bohr’s correspondence principle how-
ever gives us a signiﬁcant hint on how to describe the reaction of
the atom to the radiation ﬁeld, using classical concepts. In a re-
cently published paper by Bohr, Kramers and Slater, the authors
sketched in rough outline how such a description can be accom-
plished in a relatively simple manner. What is above all typical
for this theory, is the assumption that the reaction of the atom to
the radiation ﬁeld should primarily be understood as a reaction
of an atom existing in a given stationary state; it is also assumed
that transitions between two stationary states are of very short
duration, and that the detailed nature of these transitions will
not play any role in the description of the optical phenomena. 15

Folowing this path, it is assumed that, under the inﬂuence of an exter-
nal radiation, given by an oscillating electric ﬁeld with amplitude E0and

quencies given by Bohr’s conditions νq = (Ek −
the coherent and the spontaneous radiation should then lead to a modiﬁca-
tion of the secondary radiation. The form of these modiﬁcations as aﬀecting
the ν
dependence had been investigated by Kramers (1924) relying on clas-
sical dispersion theory and the correspondence principle. There, spontaneous
emission was analyzed in terms of classical oscillators with eigen-frequencies
ν q and the actual (quantum) behaviour obtained taking the limit of high
quantum numbers. The paper of Kramers and Heisenberg further extended
the analysis of Kramers:

It is the purpose of this paper to show how the correspondence
idea, when pursued more closely, leads to the surprising result
that the assumption (2) for the reaction of an atom to incident
radiation is too restricted, and will in general have to be extended
by adding a series of terms as follows:

where hν k or hν l denote the energy diﬀerence between two
stationary states of the atom, one of which is always identical
with the momentary state of the atom; the vectors dk and dl again
depend on E (in the form of a linear vector function) and on ν .
Expressed in words, the result can be stated as follows: Under the
inﬂuence of irradiation with monochromatic light, an atom not
only emits coherent spherical waves of the same frequency as that
of the incident light: it also emits systems of incoherent spherical
waves, whose frequencies can be represented as combinations of
the incident frequency with other frequencies that correspond to
possible transitions to other stationary states. Such additional
systems of spherical waves must evidently occur in the form of

9

scattered light; but they cannot make any contribution to the
dispersion and absorption of the incident light.16

The analysis of Kramers and Heisenberg does not rely on the concept of
light quanta, which as we have mentionned, was still considered by some as
unwarranted. However, their result is related to some earlier work by Smekal
(1923) who explicitely used the corpuscular hypothesis. Smekal’s paper is
remarkable, not only because of his use of the corpuscular hypothesis, but
also because it conjectured a new eﬀect, incoherent scattering of light by
atoms17. This is what Kramers and Heisenberg tell us above. This eﬀect,
nowadays called Raman scattering, was conﬁrmed experimentally in 192818.
A more detailed discussion of the Heisenberg-Kramers would be here out
of place; we wanted merely to illustrate the spirit of an approach using the
correspondence principle, the latter, when coupled to the general theory of
multiply periodic systems (not discussed here19), being then the sole system-
atic theoretical tool in the obtention of quantum results before the break-
through of quantum mechanics.

3 Semi-classical attempts to Compton scat-

tering

3.1

Introduction

In the ﬁrst attempts at studying matter-radiation interaction, as in the prob-
lem of illuminating an atom with radiation, the standpoint was to consider,
the re-emitted radiation as a result of some internal process involving the elec-
trons within a well-deﬁned regime, described as a classical multiply-periodic
system to which the quantization rules could then further be applied with the
guidance of the correspondence principle. The situation changed drastically
with the advent of quantum mechanics and the availability of genuine quan-
tum evolution equations. Then, the interaction of electrons with radiation
could be, at least in principle, handled directly. In the ﬁrst stage, where the

in the long-wave approximation, was generalized to low energy x-rays and bound electrons
by Wentzel 1927, using non-relativistic quantum mechanics. See also Waller 1929.

radiation ﬁeld wasn’t quantized yet, one had to use semi-classical methods
deriving the features of the secondary radiation from the classical Maxwell
formulas supplemented by the quantum expressions for charge and current
densities.

In what follows, we shall review several contributions which we chose
to group together because they all share a peculiar interplay of classical and
quantum techniques. None of the authors (including Klein and Nishina) were
working consistently in a purely quantum mechanical setting, until the con-
tributions of Waller and especially that of Tamm in 1930, which were already
part of the next stage, starting with the ﬁeld quantization breakthrough of
Dirac in 1927. This interplay illustrates how young the quantum formalism
was in those years and how dominant the inﬂuence of the correspondence
principle still was.

3.2 Dirac: ﬁrst uses of the new quantum mechanics

We start our story with a publication of Dirac (Dirac 1926b, received 29
April 1926), who applied Heisenberg’s matrix formalism to provide a ﬁrst
treatment of the Compton scattering within the setting of the newly born
quantum mechanics20. In this paper, as in the preceding ones (Dirac 1925
and 1926a), considerable eﬀort is devoted to the development of a univer-
sal q-calculus, wherein Born, Heisenberg and Jordan’s original formalism is
systematized and generalized (Born, Heisenberg and Jordan 1926). His treat-
ment tries moreover to build relativity into the matrix formalism, a rather
cumbersome task because of the necessarily privileged role of time in the
canonical formalism. The key idea is to use in those terms of the matrix
elements which are related to an oscillation of angular frequency ω = 2πν,
instead of the non covariant expressions exp(iωt), the relativistic expressions
exp(iωt′), where

t′ = t

(4)

Here, (l1, l2, l3) is the unit vector in the direction of observation and xi
i =
1, 2, 3 the coordinates of the electron. Clearly, (l1, l2, l3) will eventually corre-
spond to the direction of the scattered (secondary) photon. The 1926 paper
achieves this program using only the tools of canonical commutation relations

20It is interesting to mention also a paper by Schr¨odinger (1927) where he obtains the
conservation law of the Compton scattering using the analogy between radiation ”scatter-
ing” oﬀ the square of the wave function, and radiation scattered oﬀ a pressure wave, as
solved by Brillouin.

of operators21. Dirac will publish a second paper (1927a, received 22 Nov.
1926) where he reaches the same goal with the help of wave mechanics. The
physical treatment of both papers shares the same overall strategy. However,
the use of wave mechanics makes the calculations easier because, according
to Dirac:

This [matrix mechanics] method is rather artiﬁcial; particu-
larly so since on the quantum theory there is no unique way of
writing the Hamiltonian equation [...] (owing to the ambiguity in
the order of the factors in H), and it has to be proved that all rea-
sonable ways of doing so lead to the same results. A more natural
and more easily understood method of obtaining the matrices is
provided by Schr¨odinger’s wave mechanics22.

Indeed, instead of using quantum equations for canonical operators com-
patible with the variable t′, one can in the wave formalism simply work at the
level of the solutions ψ of the wave equation. Assuming known a set of such
solutions ψαparametrized by some quantum numbers (collectively denoted
α) the matrix elements of any dynamical variable C are obtained through
the expansion

Cψα =

Cαα′ψα′

(5)

Xα′
where the matrix elements Cαα′ can then be expressed as functions of t′.
The oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements are further interpreted as related to the
transition from state α to state α′, as initiated in Heisenberg (1925), Born,
Heisenberg and Jordan (1926), and in Dirac’s own papers, as for instance
Dirac (1926a). This is precisely the road that Dirac will follow in his second
paper as we discuss it now23.

21The paper was apparently not easy to understand, to witness Klein (1968) p. 79: ”One
day Ehrenfest brought us [Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit] a new paper by Dirac containing a
quantum dynamical theory of the Compton eﬀect which we tried to read, but without

in Leiden (until Oct. 9th). In the few days we have left, he, Uhlenbeck and I are struggling
together for hours at a time studying your work, for Einstein is eager to understand it.
But we are hitting at a few diﬃculties, which - because the presentation is so short - we
seem absolutely unable to overcome.”

We have now a set of solutions ψ(~p2,~p3,~E) each parametrized by the quantum

radiation. To study the features of the secondary radiation, one has now to
determine the relevant observables. Since classically the secondary radiation
is related to the oscillation of the electron, the latter are chosen to be the
amplitudes of vibration along (a basis) of axes chosen perpendicular to the
direction of observation (l1, l2, l3). Dirac sets27:

The knowledge of the constants of motion c2, c3, c4 above is not material here

Concerning ~p1, it can be obtained, relying on the analogy with the free case,
as the coeﬃcient of ˜x1 in the eq. (12) at the price of neglecting a′ sin k1˜x1.
This yields

To justify this step Dirac oﬀers the following classical ”justiﬁcation”. The
neglecting of a′ enables to give meaning to the variation of p1 because, in
order to give a meaning to the recoil momentum of the electron we must
neglect the oscillations of the electron due to the incident radiation.28. Using

The features of the emitted radiation are then obtained in the following
way. Recall that X represents a component of the polarization and its matrix
elements have been determined (see (13) and (14)). Relying on Heisenberg’s
prescriptions, and his own results29, Dirac identiﬁes the product Xpp′Xp′p
(here we denote collectively the quantum numbers by p) as a quarter of the
square of the amplitude of vibration in the X-direction. The square of the
2is accordingly the sum of that for X and that for the
total amplitude

This formula is the classical dipole approximation for the radiation emitted
by an oscillating density of charge and current. Since for h = 0 one has in
(14) ~E′ = ~E, the quantum expression for the intensity turns out to be equal
to (~E/~E′) times its classical value (see Dirac’s ﬁrst paper p. 405-406 and the

where I0 = a2ω2/8πc is the intensity of the primary radiation, and φ is the

Compton (Compton 1923), Dirac observes:

[...] the experimental values are all less than the values given
by the present theory, in roughly the same ratio (75 per cent.),
which shows that the theory gives the correct law of variation
of intensity with angle, and suggests that in absolute magnitude
Compton’s values are 25 per cent. too small31.

The source of this discrepancy will be clariﬁed by Klein and Nishina 1929.

30The diﬀerential scattering cross section dσ

dΩ is nowadays deﬁned as the ratio of the
number of scattered particles into the unit solid angle over the number of incident particles.
This is related to the energy radiated per unit time, unit solid angle and unit incident
intensity, because the energy is the number of light quanta multiplied by ~ω. To make
contact with the preceding equation for the intensity one has to multiply it by r2, divide
by the intensity of the incident (plane) wave, and multiply by ω

3.3 Gordon: quantized current of a scalar electron as

source of the retarded classical potential

At the end of the second paper of Dirac, a footnote added in proof mentions
a paper by Walter Gordon dealing with the same subject.
Indeed, before
Dirac’s second paper appeared, Gordon had treated the same problem, al-
beit in a more detailed way (Gordon 1926, received 29 Sept. 1926)32. As
Dirac previously, and following Schr¨odinger’s prescription, he derived the
relativistic quantum wave equation for a spinless charged particle coupled to
the classical electromagnetic potential33 Aµ:

(22)

This invariant wave equation is named today after him and Oscar Klein,
who had obtained the same expression in a publication that appeared a few
months earlier (Klein 1926)34. An important feature of Gordon’s paper is
his understanding of gauge transformations at the wave function level. He

properly realized that to the transformation Aα →

In his derivation of the secondary radiation, the strategy followed by Gor-
don sets the standard for subsequent works. It is, together with the previous
approach by Dirac, a testimony to the power of the quantum formalism which
takes care of the situation way beyond what might have been expected at
ﬁrst sight. The electron is considered as perturbed from its free evolution by
the primary radiation. Assuming its perturbed motion as known, the fea-
tures of the secondary radiation are then obtained from the classical radiation

32It appears that Klein and Uhlenbeck were also working on the wave approach to
Compton scattering but didn’t reach a quantitative result before Gordon. (Klein 1968,
p. 79). This seems as well to have been the case with Pauli, see Rechenberg and Mehra
1982-87, vol. 5, p. 830.

33Gordon writes Φ instead of A
34One should at this point also mention the results of Schr¨odinger himself (Schr¨odinger
1926d) and Fock (1926). Further references can be found in Schweber (1961), p. 54.
and Kragh 1984. The naming of the scalar relativistic equation after Klein and Gordon
appears then quite arbitrary.

35The same had already been realized by Fock (1926).

These densities are obtained from the wave equation in a way similar to
that used by Schr¨odinger in his pioneering work on the non-relativistic case.
Actually, there is an implicit factor of e in front of this expression which is
”hidden” in the normalization of ψ as will be explained shortly, see eqs. (30)
and (32).

Notice how the strategy followed by Gordon diﬀers from that of Dirac ex-
amined earlier. Gordon uses the classical radiation formula with retardation
into which he inserts the quantum expression for the current. It is through
the latter that the quantum features will enter the stage, namely the proper
correlation between initial and ﬁnal states, and the resulting secondary radi-
ation, as will be seen shortly. Dirac, on the other hand, inserted by hand the
kx) by a change of variables, and used a ﬁnal dipole
covariant phase (ct
approximation formula, where he injected the squared quantum amplitude
for the polarization. In his case, the information about the ﬁnal state and the
resulting secondary radiation is obtained from the action of the polarization
observable upon the initial state. In view of the fact that Gordon obtained
the same ﬁnal result as Dirac, the two approaches prove equivalent albeit
their heuristics is diﬀerent.

−

Gordon’s ”two-step” scheme of computation (ﬁrst solve the radiation-
perturbed electron evolution, then compute the resulting classical radiation
and interpret the latter as Compton radiation) leans upon an approximation
not easily expressible within the framework of more modern (fully quantized)
approaches (the same holds also for Dirac’s approach discussed earlier). Nev-
ertheless, its success is remarkable, especially so in the Klein-Nishina com-
putation to be discussed shortly, where, to the order considered, a correct
formula is obtained in spite of using a classical electromagnetic ﬁeld. The
reasons of this “two-step” technique are clear. Until the advent of Dirac’s
ﬁeld quantization (1927), there was no way to treat the interaction of the
radiation ﬁeld with matter quantum mechanically. The quantum ingredient
could only be introduced using the quantum evolution equations for matter
subjected to (classical) radiation and radiating back classically through the
associated charge and densities (quantum) expressions (this is dubbed by
the various authors as a korrespondenzm¨assig procedure36). The power of
the quantum formalism is manifest in the fact that it is eﬀectively suﬃcient

36see for instance Klein (1926), p. 416.

19

to use a quantum evolution equation for the electron (and keeping radia-
tion classical) to achieve a result where the process is handled in terms of
an eﬀective matrix element between initial and ﬁnal quantum states, thus
introducing an element of discontinuity in a otherwise apparently continuous
process. In this picture, the discrete shifts in the frequency (and wave vector)
of the radiation can be understood as induced by the quantum evolution of
the electron wave function itself. Notice that these features are not explicitly
present in the original formulation of the problem. There, a purely classical
electromagnetic radiation aﬀects the motion of the electron which radiates
according to the classical laws, all this along a purely continuous course of
events: by the very nature of the approach, no such notions as initial or ﬁnal
states can ﬁnd their way naturally in this context.

To see how the discontinuity related to a transition from initial to ﬁnal
states emerges out of this seemingly continuous context, let us deﬁne with
Gordon the radiation ﬁeld as Aµ = aµ cos ϕ where37 ϕ = (kx
x
with x0 = ct and k0 = ω/c The description of the perturbed electron motion
is obtained by Gordon with the additional approximation that the terms A2
in (22) can be neglected, in the same way as in Dirac. He thus ends up
solving the truncated equation

(cid:17)
A few remarks are in order here. The neglect of the A2 terms may appear
surprising as far as as the electrodynamics of scalar particles is considered.
Indeed, one can show (using for example the modern propagator approach;
see also section 7.2) that there is a natural gauge choice where the total con-
tribution to the scattering amplitude in the laboratory frame (initial electron
at rest) comes precisely from this particular term38. However, In his paper,
Gordon does not commit himself explicitely to any particular gauge or frame.
To understand the situation, one has to remember again the peculiar nature
of the semi-classical approach used here. In this picture, the current eq. (24)
contains already the coupling to the primary photon39, as evidenced by the
term proportionnal to e, namely

In the course of the calculation, the ”coupling” to the secondary photon (to
use modern expressions) will be obtained indirectly and at this point it is

37Instead of k, Gordon uses the notation l.
38See e. g. Bjorken and Drell 1964, pp. 194-195. This is further explained in section

6.2. of the present paper.

where dp =dp1dp2dp3. It contains two factors: z(p), that Gordon identiﬁes
as a weighting of the individual solutions (27), and C(p) that he considers
a normalization. The reason for this splitting will appear shortly. Gordon
builds then the bilinear expressions entering the current four-vector (24)

where the labels i and j run over the set of the solutions of (25). Hence,
considering superpositions (30), one can obtain the current (24) as a sum
of ”transition currents” related to a quantum transition from eigenstate i to
eigenstate j. This is just how the initial and ﬁnal states of the electron will
enter the stage.

40This is the solution of the truncated equation (25); the solution of the full equation

would involve terms quadratic in the potential.

21

The value of normalization factor C(p) is obtained by Gordon using a
comparison with the classical case and the arbitrary (but then familiar re-
quirement) that

hence the splitting41. The value of C(p) turns then out to be

z2(p)dp = 1,

C 2(p) =

4πh2E

(32)

where E is given by (29). Notice here the presence of another e factor
in the numerator. This is the one alluded to in the comment after eq. (24).
Combined with the one already present in the term eq. (26), it makes for the
correct e2 dependence of the result. This justiﬁes a posteriori the neglect of
the quadratic terms not only in eq. (25), but also in the next steps.

Indeed, Gordon is now in position to obtain the features of the secondary
radiation using the preceding expressions to build up the current in (23): He
ﬁrst expands the exponentials in eq. (31 ) to ﬁrst order in a, then, assuming
that the charge distribution is of negligable size with respect to the distance

This is how in this correspondence principle way the elements of the now
so-familiar picture of electron-photon process emerge albeit in a semi-classical
context yet not involving Dirac’s ﬁeld quantization nor perturbation theory.
To make contact with modern treatments, the reader can contract the gauge
invariant expression (34)with the polarization vector of the secondary photon,
which in a sense provides the second external photon line supplementing the
one already present in the current (24), (to be compared with for instance
eq. (9.30) of Bjorken and Drell45 and section 6.2 of the present paper).

Before turning to the Klein-Nishina paper (and later to Waller and Tamm),
we want to mention a contribution of Klein 1927 submitted at the very end
of 1926 and entitled Elektrodynamik und Wellenmechanik vom Standpunkt
des Korrespondenzprinzips.
In this paper, Klein also uses the relativistic
scalar equation and studies its various applications to the dispersion of light
by atoms and free electrons. As indicated in the title, Klein discusses quite
extensively the spirit of the correspondence principle approach. Anyone in-
terested in the heuristics of the latter will ﬁnd in Klein’s contribution a
valuable discussion of this method. Another feature of Klein’s paper is
an interesting perturbative scheme which the latter proposes to deal with
time-dependent problems. It ﬁts somehow between the original proposal of
Schr¨odinger and announces that of Dirac46. Klein’s scheme is however prac-
tical only in the case of equations linear (ﬁrst order) in time derivative, so
that, albeit in possession of the scalar relativistic equation, Klein considers
only its non-relativistic limit (Schr¨odinger equation)when discussing the dis-
persion of light scattered oﬀ atoms, or uses instead an ansatz for the case of
Compton scattering.

3.4 Klein and Nishina: spin 1/2 electrons

The Klein-Nishina paper (Klein and Nishina 1929, received 30 Oct. 1928) is
the ﬁrst to apply the freshly discovered spinor equation of Dirac (Dirac 1928,
received 2 Jan. 1928) to Compton scattering. It reads, using the original set
of σi and ρi, i = 1, .., 3 introduced by Dirac47,

As already mentioned, the use of this relativistic equation which takes into
account the electron spin constitutes the main novelty of the paper. For
the rest, it closely follows the correspondence principle strategy of Gordon.
Instead of the expressions for the current densities (24) pertaining to the
scalar (Klein-Gordon) equation, Klein and Nishina use instead the Dirac
densities

ρ = e¯ψγ0ψ′
J = ec¯ψγψ′

(38)

Here ¯ψ stands for the (one-row) spinor obtained from ψ via hermitian con-
jugation and multiplication by the matrix γ0: ¯ψ = (ψ∗)tγ0. ψ is taken as
solution of the second-order equation (the scalar potential V is set to zero)

supplemented by spin terms. As in the latter’s case, quadratic terms in the
potential are thus further neglected. The ”initial-ﬁnal” picture emerges also
in a way analogous to that of Gordon, Klein and Nishina following essentially
the same steps; they obtain for instance as the analog of (35) the result:

49This use of the second order equations may appear puzzling. It is possible that Klein
and Nishina used the latter instead of (36) to keep close to the original discussion of
Gordon.

50Klein and Nishina’s notation for the potential is U.
51Klein and Nishina write v(p) instead of u(p), the latter denoting in their paper the
adjoint spinor v(p)†. In order not to make the discussion unnecessarily cluttered with
notations, we do not discuss here the conventions on the basis of spinor solutions to the
free Dirac equation.

26

In order to obtain explicit formulas for the intensity of the scattered
radiation, Klein and Nishina still have to go through the tedious steps of the
evaluation of products consisting typically of initial and ﬁnal spinors ¯u(p) and
u′(p′) sandwiching various combinations of spin matrices. The technicalities
involved in these calculations don’t bring any further physical insight and we
shall not comment them here52. Klein and Nishina ﬁnally obtain the following
celebrated expression for the scattering cross section for unpolarized incident
light, and in the rest frame of the initial electron

where θ is the scattering angle, and α = ~ω/mc2. It diﬀers from the result
obtained earlier by Dirac (and also Gordon) by terms of second order in α and
higher (compare with (21)). We know nowadays that this expression consti-
tutes the correct result to the lowest order. It is indeed remarkable that Klein
and Nishina were able to obtain it within such a semi-classical context. The
reason of this success is due to the quantum mechanism, already mentioned
above, which automatically takes care of shifting the state of the photon
ensuring conservation of energy-momentum, and to the fact that at the tree
level, where multiple eﬀects of emission/absorption are neglected, it is suﬃ-
cient to consider the radiation ﬁeld as classical. The following appreciation
may serve as a closing word53

.[In calculating] the scattering of an electromagnetic wave by a
charged particle, Maxwell’s classical equations were used, but
the transition current was substituted for the classical current on
their right-hand side. The justiﬁcation of this operation was that
if in the ordinary formula for the current the wave function and
its conjugate were replaced by their expansions in Fourier inte-
grals the resulting double integral could be interpreted as the sum
(integral) of all possible contributions (with diﬀerent frequencies)
to the total radiation. This semiclassical method in no way took
into account the quantum nature of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and
by its own nature did not involve calculations with intermedi-
ate states, the Compton eﬀect being treated in a certain sense
as a ﬁrst-order eﬀect. This fact was fortunate for the authors,

52Let’s remark however that the technical tricks making the reduction of the spinor

algebra much easier are due to Casimir 1933 and Wannier 1935.

Waller.54

4 Dirac’s perturbation theory, ﬁeld-quantization

and intermediate states

In this chapter, we shall examine the key role of the perturbation theory and
ﬁeld quantization introduced by Dirac (and used subsequently him by Waller
and Tamm). The two developments are related since Dirac quantizes the
radiation ﬁeld within the context of his perturbation theory for Bose particles.
The choice of the perturbation technique (as distinct from the choice of the
approximation, or better, physical treatment of the process) is an important
theme surfacing again and again in our story. The interpretation following
a given perturbative scheme has a major role in the way the whole process
is pictured and understood.We ﬁrst start with a brief recall of the situation
prior Dirac’s theory.

One of the ﬁrst formulations of the time-dependent perturbation theory
within quantum mechanics goes logically back to the ”Drei-M¨anner-Arbeit
” of Born, Heisenberg and Jordan (1926). It is formulated in terms of the
matrix formalism and relies on the analogy with the classical canonical for-
malism. It enables the authors to derive as an application the Heisenberg-
Kramers dispersion relations.

With the advent of wave mechanics, the community took possession
of a new, mathematically more familiar tool. The perturbation theory in
wave mechanics superseded then the matrix version. Schr¨odinger devel-
oped the perturbation theory for time independent Hamiltonians in his third
It is essentially an application of Sturm the-
paper (Schr¨odinger 1926c).
ory. The time-dependent perturbation theory appears in the last paper of
Schr¨odinger’s tetralogy (Schr¨odinger 1926d), where he introduces his cele-
brated time-dependent equation:

is the Laplacian. As an example, Schr¨odinger set out to solve
the problem of the evolution in a time-dependent potential of the form V =

states of the electron as will be seen in the next section.

where the constant coeﬃcients akn = [A]kn are the matrix elements of A taken
in the basis un of the solutions of the free A = 0 case. His technique consisted
in eliminating the time dependence and use then the time-independent theory
of his preceding paper. He interpreted the expression above in terms of a
time-dependent potential driving the system out of its pure uk -oscillating
mode and superposing on it secondary oscillations of frequencies ~−1Ek ±
ω. The heuristics of such a formula were clearly of particular meaning for
the problem of dispersion (scattering of radiation oﬀ an atom).
Indeed,
computing the resulting electric moment, Schr¨odinger obtained a result that
he declared ”as formally quite identical with Kramers’ formula for secondary
radiation”55.

4.1 Dirac’s perturbation theory for bosons

In the paper On the Theory of Quantum Mechanics (Dirac 1926c)56, where
the Einstein B coeﬃcient of stimulated emission and absorption is derived
from ﬁrst principles, Dirac uses for the ﬁrst time his perturbation theory
for Hamiltonians with explicit time dependence. It is a signiﬁcant and de-
cisive step, its importance going much beyond the purely formal content.
Indeed, it oﬀers the advantage to lend itself to quite general situations but,
mainly, together with Dirac’s interpretation, it paves the way to ﬁeld quanti-
zation (1927b)57 and naturally construes elementary processes as transitions
between ”free states”. Dirac’s method was to be adopted in most of the
following works and its spirit conserved in the modern techniques.

Dirac develops a systematic approach to deal with arbitrary (time-dependent)

perturbations in the following way. Assume that we have a (complete) set
of solutions ϕk of a problem associated with the Hamiltonian H0 , typi-
cally a non-interacting atom or particle; the general solution then reads:
ϕ =
i ciϕi. Then consider a new Hamiltonian H = H0 + Hint. To solve the

corresponding problem, Dirac proposes to expand its solution ψ on the set
of the free ones:

ψ =

ak(t)ϕk

(46)

Xk
The ak ’s are the expansion coeﬃcients that remain to be determined58. Dirac
remarks further, that instead of considering the ak ’s to give the probabilities
of being in the state k, one can as well think of them here as giving the
number of individual (disturbed) systems occupying the state k. Talking of
atoms, Dirac says (p. 674):

We shall consider the general solution of [the undisturbed]
equation to represent an assembly of the undisturbed atoms in

The exact evolution equations for the ak ’s are:

where [Hint]kn are matrix elements of H int (in the ϕ basis). All that remains
to be done is to solve the above equations since the whole time-dependence
of the solution is contained in the a ’s. This can, and in most cases must
be done, perturbatively. For instance, assuming that at t = 0, the system is
entirely in the unperturbed state, say a0(0) = 1, so that ak = 0; k
= 0, then
one can get, inserting on the right-hand side of (47) the initial values, at ﬁrst
order

If the matrix elements [Hint]k0 vanish (so that there is no direct contribution
to ak) then the method of approximation has to be reﬁned59. If, for some
58One should notice at this point that in his study of the relativistic scalar equation Klein
(1927) developed a perturbative scheme that used already the expansion on free solutions.
His technique is however less general and can be seen as a special case of Dirac’s. Klein’s
approach was derived for the classical approximation of the scalar relativistic equation,
involving only ﬁrst order time derivative.

The formulas above constitute the main results of perturbation theory

that we shall ﬁnd used by many authors in the next sections.

There is however much more to Dirac’s technique. In his celebrated paper
The quantum theory of emission and absorption of radiation (Dirac 1927b,
received 2 Febr. 1927) the whole discussion is resumed and the equations (47)
are cast in a Hamiltonian form. Thus, the ak ’s and the complex conjugated
a∗
k ’s acquire the status of the dynamical variables of some new abstract
problem. The latter is classical, but Dirac, with his fascinating intuition,
asks us to consider the quantum version of this new problem. He writes (p.
250):

...we can describe the eﬀect of a perturbation on an assem-
bly of independent systems by means of canonical variables and
Hamiltonian equations of motion. The development of the theory
which naturally suggests itself is to make these canonical variables
q-numbers satisfying the usual quantum conditions instead of c-
numbers, so that their Hamiltonian equations of motion become
true quantum equations. The Hamiltonian function will now pro-
vide a Schr¨odinger wave equation, which must be solved and in-
terpreted in the usual manner. The interpretation will give not
merely the probable number of systems in any state, but the prob-
ability of any given distribution of the systems among the various
states, this probability being, in fact, equal to the square of the
modulus of the normalized solution of the wave equation that
satisﬁes the appropriate initial conditions. We could of course
calculate directly from elementary considerations the probability
of any given distribution when the systems are independent, as we
know the probability of each system being in any particular state.
We shall ﬁnd that the probability calculated directly in this way
does not agree with that obtained from the wave equation except
in the special case when there is only one system in the assembly.
In the general case it will be shown that the wave equation leads
to the correct value for the probability of any given distribution

function of the atom. The case of the intermediate states will be discussed by Dirac later
in his paper 1927c. Our treatment here follows Heitler 1936, p. 89.

when the systems obey Einstein-Bose statistics instead of being
independent.

So, now, the a∗

k ’s and the ak ’s become q-numbers, namely the now famil-
iar creation and annihilation operators of the corresponding (undisturbed)
boson states60. A huge step has been taken. Dirac will show next that his
second-quantized procedure (now the name is much more meaningful) prop-
erly takes into account Bose-Einstein statistics. Dirac discusses this point
using instead of the operators ak , a∗
k the canonical variables corresponding
to the operators Nk = a∗
kak and their canonical conjugated θk. This makes
the wave function of this second-quantized problem depend on the occupa-
tion numbers of the states of the bosons. Indeed, the wave function is deﬁned
on the manifold of the Nk variables, or more properly, the manifold deﬁned
by the spectrum of the Nk operators which are the positive integers61).

So far, Dirac’s analysis concerns an assembly of bosons the perturbation of
which results from a potential expressed solely in terms of boson variables.
There is as yet no ”coupling” to some other system.
In the same paper
(1927b), Dirac will consequently generalize his technique, coupling the bosons
to a given external system, typically an atom. When the bosons are light
quanta, and although the interaction matrix elements are a priori not known,
Dirac is already able at this point to derive the correct dependence of the
probabilities for stimulated and spontaneous emission (Einstein’s A and B
coeﬃcients) upon the intensity of the incident radiation. This is because the
algebra of boson operators contains automatically the right dependence on
the occupation numbers.

With Dirac’s perturbation theory and the remarkable use he will make
of it in his quantization of the radiation ﬁeld, we enter deﬁnitely into a new
era. The basic ingredients of the machinery of QED are now set, but several
important problems are not yet resolved. One feature that remains to be in-

60Actually Dirac will quantize the canonical variables

where Wr is the energy of state r, setting

This enables to factor out the trivial time dependence due to free evolution.

61For further details about the relation between a choice of state-space basis and the
variables entering the wave-functions, see Dirac’s ”transformation theory” as developped in

cluded is a proper way to take into account the reaction of the emitted radia-
tion on the source itself, called R¨uckwirkung, which we translate here as back-
reaction. This problem is related to the more fundamental problem of a rela-
tivistic and interacting theory of particles and ﬁelds. For now, we want to ex-
amine some early applications of Dirac’s perturbation/quantization method
which recast Compton scattering in the now familiar formulation of a tran-
sition from initial to ﬁnal states through successive absorption/emission (or
emission/absorption) of an intermediate photon, but where the reaction of
the radiation on the electron is still not considered.

4.2 Dirac’s quantization of the radiation ﬁeld

A spectacular application of the formalism above is Dirac’s quantized theory
In the 1927b paper this is
of the interaction of matter with radiation .
achieved in the following way: the radiation ﬁeld is ﬁrst quantized as an
assembly of independent bosons, then formally coupled to an external system
according to the scheme of the preceding section. To determine explicitely
this coupling to matter, Dirac considers the ”wave” point of view, where this
time he expands the vector potential A into its Fourier components (which
he supposes of large but ﬁnite number A =
r Ar). In this ”wave point of
view”, the coupling is explicitely given by

P

c−1

˙XAr

(50)

r
X
involving the time-derivative of the total ”polarization” X of the (atom)
system in the direction of Ar, where relativistic eﬀects have been neglected62.
After some manipulation, Dirac shows the equivalence of this point of view
with the previous ”bosonic” one. This is satisfying, as the Fourier expansion
amounts to the decomposition of the vector potential A in a basis of plane
waves, which are the solutions for the free radiation (see eq. 46). The payoﬀ
is that the matrix elements of the interaction are now explicitely determined.
Eventually, Dirac ends up with the following formalism: One ﬁrst considers
the Hamiltonian of matter and free bosons H0 = Hmatter +
r WrNr where
Hmatter is originally the Hamiltonian describing atomic states, Wr = ~ωr are

This interaction shall be replaced by a relativistically accurate expression

because the coupling above is linear in the ﬁeld, Dirac notes (Dirac 1927c, p.

light-quantum jumps from one state to another of the same fre-
quency but diﬀerent direction of motion (i.e. the corresponding
matrix element vmm′ = 0 ). All the same, radiation that has ap-
parently been scattered can appear by a double process in which
a third state, n say, with diﬀerent proper energy from m and m′
, plays a part.
[...] The scattered radiation thus appears as the
result of the two processes [...] one of which must be an absorp-
tion and the other an emission, in neither of which is the total
proper energy even approximately conserved.

On the other hand, the full interaction Hamiltonian which does not ne-
glect the terms quadratic in A does yield contributions to direct scattering
processes.

The 1926c and 1927b,c papers of Dirac set the basic language and con-
cepts characteristic of the modern conception of the elementary processes
as sequences of absorption/emission of light quanta, passing through a se-
quence of intermediate states. Let us quote him again, this time with a lucid
discussion of the apparent violation of conservation laws (Dirac 1927b, p.
265):

Also the theory enables one to understand how it comes about
that there is no violation of the law of the conservation of energy
when, say, a photo-electron is emitted from an atom under the
action of extremely weak incident radiation. The energy of inter-
action of the atom and the radiation is a q-number that does not
commute with the ﬁrst integrals of the motion of the atom alone
or with the intensity of the radiation Thus one cannot specify
this energy by a c-number at the same time that one speciﬁes the
stationary state of the atom and the intensity of the radiation by
c-numbers. In particular, one cannot say that the interaction en-
ergy tends to zero as the intensity of the incident radiation tends
to zero. There is thus always an unspeciﬁable amount of interac-
tion energy which can supply the energy for the photo-electron.

4.3 Waller: Compton scattering with quantized radi-

ation

The success of the ﬁrst applications of Dirac’s technique (computation of
Einstein’s A and B coeﬃcients in 1927b, rederivation of the Kramers’ and
Heisenberg’s formulas and study of the case of resonance in 1927c) will mo-
tivate others to apply it to further problems. However almost two years pass

35

before the ﬁrst to react, Ivar Waller (Waller 1929, received 21 July 1929 and
Waller 1930, received the 12 Febr. 1930), at that time at the University of
Upsala, and Igor Tamm (Tamm 1930, received the 7 Apr. 1930) in Moscow,
publish their results64.

The ﬁrst contribution of Waller, Die Streuung kurzwelliger Strahlung
durch Atome nach der Diracschen Strahlungstheorie, dates from 1929 (Waller
1929). There, Waller considers again the problem of radiation scattering oﬀ
an atom, neglecting relativistic eﬀects at the level of the electron bound in
the Coulomb potential. He uses on the other hand the full coupling 1
2m(p+
e
c A)2 without neglecting the A2 terms. After studying transitions at the level
of the discrete spectrum, he considers also its continuous part (ionization)
and ends up with a short account of the relativistic case, where he quotes
some preliminary results obtained using Dirac’s equation for the electron.
He explicitly mentions the need of taking into account the ”negative energy”
intermediate states, but further analysis is missing.
It will appear in full
extent in Waller’s next paper, Die Streuung von Strahlung durch gebundene
und freie Elektronen nach der Diracschen relativistischen Mechanik (Waller
1930, received 12 Feb. 1930). Technically, Waller’s 1930’s paper is a straight-
forward application of the techniques put forward by Dirac. As previously
Klein and Nishina, Waller considers the interacting equation

−

i (

γ0(E + eV ) + (γ, p + eA)) + mc2

Waller obtains an equation for the wave-function Φ(J; ..., Nr) depending col-
lectively on atom (electron) variables J , and light-quanta occupation num-

Waller remarks that in the derivation of the formula above the back-reaction
of the radiation on the scattering system has not been taken into account,
therefore one can obtain the same result without quantizing the ﬁeld.

One can now specialize to the free case (in the bound case, Waller neglects
the relativistic and spin eﬀects). Here, Waller takes for the ψJ (x) the free
plane-wave spinor solutions

ψσ(p) = uσ(p)e−

In the sequel of his calculation, Waller assumes the case of an electron ini-
tially at rest (ασ(p) is vanishing except in the vicinity of p = 0). To obtain
the total intensity (the K-N formula), it remains to work out the products
of the currents (64).and add the intensities for a choice of two orthogonal
polarizations e′.

Waller devotes special care to the discussion of the role of the negative
energy states in the summations over intermediate states in (63), ρ = 3 and 4.
Thus, for the free electron case, he shows that it is crucial to take them into
account in order to obtain the Klein-Nishina formula. This fact is rendered
especially dramatic in the classical limit ( hν/mc2
1) where only negative
energy intermediate states contribute to the classical scattering formula. One
has to remember that Dirac only in the same year proposed his negative-
energy sea hypothesis (Dirac 1930), and that the paradoxes connected with
the negative energy solutions (Klein 1929) were a major source of worry.
The paradoxical need of the negative states as intermediate states of the
scattering process must have certainly added to the confusion.

4.4 Tamm: matter and radiation quantized

Even if the semi-classical methods of Gordon and Klein-Nishina seem fully
suﬃcient to derive the correct expressions for the Compton scattering at
the order considered, Tamm’s 1930’s contribution goes even further than
the latter in that it considers, in addition to a quantized radiation ﬁeld,
a quantized matter ﬁeld, following the lines set up by Heisenberg and Pauli
(Heisenberg and Pauli 1929). Tamm rederives thus the Klein-Nishina formula
in a fully consistent quantum way, which he considers to be a proof of the
validity of the semi-classical approach (p. 545):

The scattering of the radiation by free electrons has already
been studied many times. However, one mainly has quantized

40

only the electron motion and, using the correspondence principle,
determined the scattered radiation from the calculated distribu-
tion of the electron current. Not only is this procedure logically
unsatisfactory, but it is ambiguous66. It is therefore of interest
to start the problem anew applying systematically the quantum-
mechanical approach (quantization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
and of the ψ wave) within the framework of Dirac’s wave equa-
tion for the electron. One rederives in this way the scattering
formula of Klein and Nishina which legitimates the correspon-
dence principle approach used by the latter.67

In his paper, Tamm recognizes as well the necessity to take into account
the negative energy intermediate states in the derivation of the KN scatter-
ing formula. The last part of his paper is devoted to the computation of
the spontaneous transition of an electron from a positive to a negative en-
ergy state with the resulting emission of two photons. This process, resp.
its inverse, is interpreted by Tamm along the lines of Dirac’s hole theory
(Dirac 1930) as pair annihilation and creation respectively; the negative en-
ergy Dirac electron is intepreted further as a proton (p. 547):

This processes can be treated consequently according to Dirac’s
theory only when one will succeed in understanding theoretically
the interaction of negative-energy electrons, the vanishing of the
ﬁeld of the electron and the ”hole” in the act of annihilation etc.
With the present status we could calculate the spontaneous elec-
tron transition from a level of positive energy to one of negative
energy only when totally neglecting these circumstances. If one
interprets the unoccupied negative energy level as a proton and
the transition just mentionned as an annihilation then the result

66Compare for instance the treatment of Smekal’s ”combination scattering” of radiation
oﬀ atoms, on one hand as in E. Schr¨odinger (Ann. d. Phys., vol. 81 (1926), p. 109), and
f. Phys., vol. 41 (1927), p. 407) on the other (note in the original
as in O. Klein (Zs.
text).

67Die Streuung der Strahlung durch freie Elektronen ist schon vielfach untersucht wor-
den. Man hat aber dabei meistenteils nur die Elektronenbewegung gequantelt und die
Streustrahlung korrespondenzm¨assig aus der berechneten Verteilung des Elektronenstroms
bestimmt. Dieses Verfahren ist aber nicht nur logisch unbefriedigend, sondern auch nicht
eindeutig. Es schien deshalb von Interesse zu sein, das Problem von neuem in einer kon-
sequenten quantenmechanischen Weise (Quantelung des elektromagnetischen Feldes und
der ψ-Wellen) unter Zugrundelegung der Diracschen Wellengleichung des Elektrons zu
behandeln. Man gelangt in dieser Weise wieder zu der von Klein und Nishina abgeleit-
eten Streuformel, wodurch die Folgerichtigkeit der von diesen Forschern durchgef¨uhrten
korrespondenzm¨assigen Behandlung des Problems best¨atigt wird.

can be summarized as follows: the annihilation occurs in a col-
lision of the electron and the proton; the eﬀective cross-section
relevant to this process is equal to the classically computed cross-
section

of the elementary charge e. Since Dirac’s theory is, in the ab-
sence of interactions, symmetrical as concerns electrons and pro-
tons, one has to interpret m in the above expression as speciﬁc,
but for the time unspeciﬁable average of the electron and proton
masses68.

It should be noted that contrary to the Compton eﬀect this annihilation
process does not have a classical counterpart in the context of the correspon-
dence principle. When commenting his result, Tamm points out that the
lifetime for the hydrogen atom, 10−3 sec., turns out to be much too small

Tamm follows the lines set by Dirac, and his obtention of the explicit
scattering formulas is a matter of technical manipulations much of the same
nature as already discussed in the case of Waller. We shall therefore not
dwelve any further on the content of Tamm’s paper, also because the issue
of second-quantization of matter waves, its most distinctive feature, is not
relevant to the work of Stueckelberg.

Before closing this section, it is interesting to signal the paper of Seishi
Kikuchi (1931). Using the Heisenberg-Pauli formalism, he shows that at the

lichkeit des spontanen Elektronen¨uberganges von einem positiven nach einem negativen
Energieniveau nur unter g¨anzlicher Vernachl¨assigung dieser Umst¨ande berechnen. Beze-
ichnet man das unbesetzte negative Energieniveau als ein Proton und den erwahnten
¨Ubergang als eine Zerstrahlung, so kann das Ergebnis folgendermassen zasammengefasst
werden: die Zerstrahlung ﬁndet bei einem Zusammenstoss des Elektrons und des Pro-
tons statt; der f¨ur einen solchen Zusammenstoss massgebende eﬀektive Querschnitt dieser
Teilchen ist gleich dem klassisch berechneten Querschnitt

same time the photon is scattered, the electron recoils, within Heisenberg’s
uncertainty relations. The Heisenberg-Pauli formalism as applied to matter-
radiation interaction has also been studied by Oppenheimer (1930). Indeed,
at the end of his paper, Waller (1930) remarks that Oppenheimer was able to
obtain the equation (55) from the Heisenberg-Pauli formalism, at the price
of neglecting the self-energy of the electron.

5 The emergence of the interaction picture

As we mentioned in the previous section, the problem of properly taking into
account the backreaction of the emitted radiation on the source is not solved
in the above papers. Here is the problem as analyzed by Dirac (Dirac 1932):

We shall now consider in detail the question of how the infor-
mation contained in classical electrodynamics can be taken over
into the quantum theory. We meet at once with the diﬃculty that
the classical theory itself is not free from ambiguity. To make
the discussion precise, let us suppose we have a single electron
interacting with a ﬁeld of radiation and consider the radiation re-
solved into ingoing and outgoing waves. The classical problem is,
given the ingoing radiation and suitable initial conditions for the
electron, determine the motion of the electron and the outgoing
radiation. The classical equations which deal with this problem
are of two kinds, (i) those that determine the ﬁeld produced by
the electron (which ﬁeld is just the diﬀerence of the ingoing and
outgoing ﬁelds) in terms of the variables describing the motion
of the electron, and (ii) those that determine the motion of the
electron. Equations (i) are quite deﬁnite and unambiguous, but
not so equations (ii). The latter express the acceleration of the
electron in terms of ﬁeld quantities at the point where the elec-
tron is situated and these ﬁeld quantities in the complete classi-
cal picture are inﬁnite and undeﬁned. In the usual approximate
treatment of the problem one takes for these ﬁeld quantities just
the contributions of the ingoing waves. This treatment is neces-
sarily only approximate, since it does not take into account the
reaction on the electron of the waves it emits. We should expect
in an accurate treatment, that the ﬁeld determining the acceler-
ation of the electron would be in some way associated with both
the ingoing and outgoing waves. Classical attempts have been
made to improve the theory by assuming a deﬁnite structure for

43

the electron and calculating the eﬀect on one part of it of the
ﬁeld produced by the rest, but such methods are not permissible
in modern physics.69

In the same paper, which, albeit not well known, constitutes a major
example of his intuition, Dirac conceives of a solution formulated in heuristic
terms. He will give it a formal expression in a subsequent paper with Fock
and Podolsky (Dirac, Fock and Podolsky 1932).

Let us make the assumption that the passage from the ﬁeld
of ingoing waves to the ﬁeld of outgoing waves is just a quantum
jump performed by one ﬁeld. This assumption is permissible on
account of the fact, discussed in the preceding section, that all
the quantities in relativistic quantum mechanics are of the nature
of probability amplitudes referring to one ingoing ﬁeld and one
outgoing ﬁeld, so that we may associate, say, the right-hand sides
of the probability amplitudes with ingoing ﬁelds and the left-hand
sides with outgoing ﬁelds. In this way we automatically exclude
quantities referring to two ingoing ﬁelds or to two outgoing ﬁelds
and make a great simpliﬁcation in the foundations of the theory.
The signiﬁcance of the new assumption lies in the fact that
the classical picture from which we derive our equations of mo-
tion must contain no reference to quantum jumps. This classical
picture must therefore involve just one ﬁeld, a ﬁeld composed
of waves passing undisturbed through the electron and satisfy-
ing everywhere Maxwell’s equations for empty space. With this
picture the equations of motion for the electron are perfectly def-
inite and unambiguous. There are no equations of motion for
the ﬁeld, as the ﬁeld throughout space-time is pictured as given.
Thus the interaction between electron and ﬁeld is introduced into
the equations in only one place.

The quantization of the equations of motion derived from this
picture may conveniently be carried out in two stages. Let us
ﬁrst quantize only the variables describing the electron. We then
get just the usual quantum theory of the motion of an electron in
a given classical ﬁeld, with the diﬀerence that in the present case
the ﬁeld must necessarily be resolvable into plane waves and must
therefore contain nothing of the nature of a Coulomb force.70

44

So, as we see, the key observation is to recognize that because of the
shortcomings of classical electrodynamics, a genuinely quantum ansatz has
to be taken (the traditional conceptual path through the correspondence
principle is no longer practical), namely that to attribute to the shift from the
ingoing to the outgoing ﬁeld a quantum jump nature. The eﬀective classical
picture which emerges is that of a free ﬁeld obeying Maxwell equations for
empty space.

What remains to be done is to ﬁnd a formal counterpart enabling one to
use free ﬁeld equations without however neglecting the backreaction. This
is exposed in the paper with Fock and Podolsky and named today the in-
teraction (or Dirac) picture (Dirac, Fock and Podolsky 1932; to some ex-
tent, this was anticipated in Dirac 1927b). Assume a composite system
described by the Hamiltonian HA + HB + V where the A and B part in-
teract via an interaction term V. A unitary transformation of the form
i/hHBT ) yields a picture where the trans-
O
formed dynamical variables of the B system, say q∗
B , obey equations of
motion for the part B alone, so that the eﬀect of the interaction term V has
been transformed away:

O∗ = exp(i/hHBT )O exp(

→

−

∂tq∗

B =

i
~ [HB, q∗
B]

The time variable of the free ( B part only) equations is then to be considered
as a separate time variable for B. If the B part stands for the radiation
Hamiltonian, and part A for the particles, the interaction picture realizes
the required trick of Dirac. The appearance of the independent time variable
t in addition to the collective time T will directly lead, in a many-body
situation, to the multi-time formalism as exposed later in the same paper.
This is because the interaction transformation yields an individual (Dirac)
equation for each separate particle with its individual time where only the
coupling to the radiation ﬁeld is present and the other particles absent (the
particles interact only through the radiation ﬁeld). In the Heisenberg-Pauli
theory of quantized ﬁelds (Heisenberg and Pauli 1929), matter is second-
quantized, the particles become an excited collective state of a ﬁeld, and
their ”individual” character is blurred, so that there is no longer any need to
use multi-particle equations and thus multiple times.

Introduction.

We come now to the ﬁnal part of our study which concentrates on the 1934
contribution of E. C. G. Stueckelberg: Relativistic invariant perturbation the-
ory of the Dirac electron; Part I: radiative scattering and Bremsstrahlung72.
Stueckelberg was at this time Privatdozent at the University of Zurich with
professor Gregor Wentzel. In the winter of 1934 he was called by the Uni-
versity of Geneva to substitute for the deceased prof. A. Schidlof. In 1935
he became there associate professor of theoretical physics. His whole career
will be spent at the Universities of Geneva and Lausanne73.

In 1934, Stueckelberg, after signiﬁcative contributions to the quantum
theory of molecular spectra and scattering74 started working on Q.E.D. At
that time, it was obviously a prominent topic and many among the most
renowned physicists were contributing75. In a letter to the president of the
Schulrat of E.T.H. in Z¨urich (8 March 1934), W. Pauli writes:

Dr. St¨uckelberg has stated his desire to get deeper involved
with Q.E.D. and agrees with the nomination of Mr. Weisskopf [as
assistant of Pauli, a position that Stueckelberg himself considered
previously].76

This quote seems to indicate that at that time Stueckelberg did not yet
feel suﬃciently acquainted with Q.E.D. However, only a couple of months
later he was ready to submit his paper to the Annalen.

Stueckelberg felt very indebted to Arnold Sommerfeld whom he approached
twice for extended periods. In a letter of 30 March 1935 he informed the lat-
ter of his nomination in Geneva and continued:

I owe my knowledge in the domain of theoretical physics mainly
to the two years which I could spend in your Institute, once as a
student and later as a National Research Fellow. Furthermore I
received my appointment in Princeton as well as my habilitation
in Zurich thanks to your recommendations. Thus I know that I
owe it mainly to you, highly esteemed Herr Geheimrat, to have
obtained this position in Geneva.

I regret of course to leave Zurich which like Princeton, was a
permanent source of inspiration to me. I add a reprint of my work
on the Dirac electron [Stueckelberg 1934]. In a note to appear
shortly in Helv. Phys. Acta the Compton scattering of moving
electrons is discussed [Stueckelberg 1935a]. These days I am busy
generalizing the calculation method to the many body problem
[Stueckelberg 1935c].77

From 7 to 11 March 1937, A. Sommerfeld was hosted by Stueckelberg in
his house in Geneva following a visit of son Johann Wolfgang in June 1936.78.
Stueckelberg’s correspondence with Sommerfeld continued over the years as
is shown by a letter of 31 March 1949 (two years before Sommerfeld’s death),
in which Stueckelberg thanks for the reception of Sommerfelds textbook on
Electrodynamics and discusses the substraction method of Dirac, his work
with Rivier and Schwinger’s theory.79

As its title shows, the aim of the 1934 paper is to provide a uniﬁed covari-
ant perturbative treatment of Compton scattering, Bremsstrahlung as well as
annihilation and creation of particle-antiparticle pairs80 (which is covered in
the subsequent publication, Stueckelberg 1935b). In his paper, Stueckelberg
thanks G. Wentzel for the suggestion to work out an invariant perturbation
theory using a four-dimensional Fourier transform81. S. S. Schweber makes
the following comment on the relation between Wentzel and Stueckelberg,
and their emphasis on manifest relativistic covariance:

When Stueckelberg came to the University of Zurich in 1933,
Wentzel was working on eliminating the divergences in relativistic
ﬁeld theories (Wentzel 1933a,b, 1934a) and he got Stueckelberg
interested in quantum ﬁeld theory. Stueckelberg began work-
ing on the ﬁeld-theoretical description of the interaction between

77Stueckelberg went to visit Sommerfeld in Munich the second time (1931-1932) with
an American fellowship. He was on leave from Princeton University where he held the
position of research associate from 1928 to 1932 (See Sopka 1991). Sopka writes further
(p.1): ”During the summer of 1928, Stueckelberg attended the Summer Symposium in
Theoretical Physics held annually at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. That year
H. A. Kramers was one of the lecturers. During this summer Stueckelberg was brought up
to date on the relativly new Quantum Mechanics and began his association with Philip
M. Morse.

78We thank Stueckelberg’s son, Dr. Georges St¨uckelberg, for this information.

particles.
It is to be noted that Dirac, Fock, and Podolsky ’s
(1932) article on quantum electrodynamics was the point of de-
parture for both Wentzel’s and Stueckelberg’s research programs
(Stueckelberg 1934, 1935c 1936). In 1938, again taking the Dirac,
Fock Podolsky paper as his starting point, Stueckelberg gave a
formulation of quantum electrodynamics and of various meson
theories in what later became known as the interaction picture.
He stressed its advantages, namely, the manifest covariance of
the ”Schr¨odinger” equation in that picture, and the possibility of
writing covariant commutation rules for ﬁeld operators at diﬀer-
ent times (Stueckelberg 1938a,b).82

According to his publications, Wentzel was mainly interested in the years
1925-1930 by the problem of light scattering oﬀ free and bound electrons,
besides studying atomic spectra with the methods of quantum mechanics,
including the relativistic H-atom83. Wentzel cared for manifest Lorentz in-
variance which is suggested by the fact that he used in two instances the
multitime formalism of Dirac, Fock and Podolsky. First, in his tentative to
eliminate the self-energy divergences in classical and quantum electrodynam-
ics (Wentzel 1933 and 1934a). Second, in his study of the possible equivalence
of a spin 1 photon and of a spin 1/2 particle and its antiparticle, following
an idea of de Broglie (Wentzel 1934b).

As we show in the present paper (sections 6.2 and 6.3) Stueckelberg in
1934 used the interaction picture of Dirac, Fock and Podolsky and again
in later publications (Stueckelberg 1936, 1938). He discussed the multitime
formalism in 1935c and 1938.

The main innovation of the 1934 paper is the introduction of a new per-
turbative scheme yielding manifestly relativistic expressions for the matrix
elements. This is achieved by performing a four-dimensional Fourier trans-
formation of the wave-function, thus eliminating space and time variables84.
Compared to Waller 1930, Tamm 1930 or Heitler 1936, Stueckelberg’s proce-
dure is thus the ﬁrst departure from the “older (Dirac) form of the perturba-
tion theory“85 .The approach proposed by Stueckelberg is far more powerful,
but was not adopted by others at the time. This lack of interest appears
retrospectively as very unfortunate, as was recognized by V. Weisskopf 1981,

82Schweber 1994 p. 577-78.
83See e.g. Wentzel 1925, 1926, 1927, 1929.
84Møller 1931 uses also the four-dimensional Fourier-transform but for the classical
retarded potential in a correspondence - theoretic treatment of electron-electron scattering
(see Kragh 1992 and Roqu´e 1992). See also Bethe-Fermi 1932.

resp. 1983, in his recollections of that period. Weisskopf reminds us of
the diﬃculties encountered in the higher order corrections to Q.E.D., and
remarks:

Already in 1934 [...] it seemed that a systematic theory could
be developed in which these inﬁnities [divergent radiative cor-
rections] are circumvented. At that time nobody attempted to
formulate such a theory [...].There was one tragic exception [...],
and that was Ernst C.G. Stueckelberg. He wrote several impor-
tant papers in 1934-38 putting forward a manifestly invariant
formulation of ﬁeld theory.

This could have been a perfect basis for developing the ideas
of renormalization. Later on, he actually carried out a com-
plete renormalization procedure in papers with D. Rivier, inde-
pendently of the eﬀorts of other authors86. Unfortunately, his
writings and his talks were rather obscure,and it was very dif-
ﬁcult to understand them or to make use of his methods. He
came frequently to Zurich in the years 1934-6, when I was work-
ing with Pauli, but we could not follow his way of presentation.
Had Pauli and I myself been capable of grasping his ideas, we
might well have calculated the Lamb shift and the correction to
the magnetic moment of the electron at the time.87

The virtue of Stueckelberg’s approach is to include the ﬁndings of his
predecessors, but making manifest the underlying general symmetry features.
These trends characterize Stueckelberg’s life-long work and our paper is the
ﬁrst stage in exploring this broader theme. We shall return to the assessment
of Stueckelberg’s contribution and its fate at the end of this paper. It is time
now to get a closer look at his method.

We recall ﬁrst the successive stages in the calculation of Compton scat-

tering.

1. Dirac 1926b; Dirac 1927a
The ﬁrst two papers of Dirac illustrate one of the ﬁrst uses of quantum
mechanics in the problem of matter-radiation interaction. The dynamical
variables of the charged particle are quantized, and its wave function obeys
the relativistic Schr¨odinger (Klein-Gordon) equation. This equation is solved
with the help of canonical transformations. The electro-magnetic ﬁeld is not
quantized.

87Weisskopf 1981, p. 78, resp. 1983, p. 74.

Their treatment is semi-classical. The electromagnetic ﬁeld is not quan-
tized, but the electron satisﬁes the relativistic Klein-Gordon, resp. Dirac
equation. The electron current, modiﬁed by the primary ﬁeld, is the source
of the ﬁnal retarded ﬁeld, calculated using Maxwell’s equations. The treat-
ment is ”continuous” and no intermediate states appear. There is however a
notion of initial and ﬁnal states with a discontinous switch from the former
to the latter. The general treatment is in principle relativistic, manifest in
Gordon’s case, implicit in the Klein-Nishina paper, where the main part of
the calculations is done in the rest frame of the electron.

3. Waller 1930 and Tamm 1930.
The radiation ﬁeld is now quantized (and the electron ﬁeld as well in
Tamm), and the time-dependent perturbation scheme of Dirac 1927b is ap-
plied. Intermediate states are now necessary because the interaction term
linear in the ﬁeld prevents a direct transition from the initial to the ﬁnal
state (see our discussion of Dirac’s paper section 4.1 and 4.2). At the inter-
action point (vertex), energy is not conserved. Although the electron obeys
the relativistic Dirac equation, the formulas of the perturbation theory break
manifest covariance, and this is reﬂected by the presence in the matrix el-
E′)−1. This is because standard
ements of the non-covariant factors (E
perturbation theory expands the full solution in a basis of unperturbed so-
lutions with time-dependent coeﬃcients, which, in the case of free motion
(plane waves), amounts to perform a Fourier transform for space variables
only. This unsymmetrical treatment of space and time makes the calcula-
tion clumsy. Furthermore, the contributions of positive and negative electron
energies in the intermediate state, necessary for obtaining the correct clas-
sical limit, are considered separately and reunited only later using spinor
identities. The results are obtained in the rest system of the electron.

−

In Stueckelberg’s 1934 paper, thanks to the use of the four-dimensional

Fourier transform, manifest covariance is kept throughout. The factor (E
−
E′)−1is now replaced by the covariant expression (p2 + M 2)−1 where p is
the four-momentum of the intermediate state, M = mc
~ , and m is the elec-
tron mass, corresponding to a virtual particle oﬀ mass-shell (p2 + M 2
= 0).
Energy and three-momentum are now conserved at the vertices. The contri-
butions of positive and negative energies (corresponding to virtual electrons
and positrons) are contained in the single propagation function (p2 + M 2)−1,
which corresponds to what later was called Feynman propagator88, and by
Rivier-Stueckelberg 1948, causal function89. All of Stueckelberg’s expressions

for matrix elements are identical to those obtained nowadays from Feynman
diagrams.

Let us mention two other important features. First, because he doesn’t
commit himself to any speciﬁc gauge, Stueckelberg’s matrix elements are
manifestly gauge invariant, a feature rather unusual for those times (for in-
stance Fermi in his review 1931, and after him Heitler 1936 worked in the
radiation (or Coulomb) gauge).

Next, in evaluating his expressions, Stueckelberg uses integration over the
complex energy-plane, making explicit use of the singularity structure as a
device for putting external particle states on mass-shell.90.

6.2 Compton scattering on scalar particles following

Stueckelberg’s method

As a warm-up exercise, we consider the scattering of photons on charged
scalar particles, using the method developed by Stueckelberg in his 1934 pa-
per on the Compton scattering on spin 1/2 electrons. This is the same prob-
lem which was solved by Dirac 1926b, 1927a, and Gordon 1926 (see section
3). Stueckelberg’s method is not only more direct, but also yields a matrix
element for the scattering process which is manifestly Lorentz and gauge in-
variant. The starting point is again the relativistic equation for the scalar
wave-function φ(x) of the ”electron”, interacting with the electromagnetic
ﬁeld Aµ, which is now quantized according to Dirac 1927b.

90Stueckelberg probably learned complex integration techniques in physics from
A.Sommerfeld, whose courses he followed in Munich 1924/1925 and whom he visited, as
we saw, in 1930. It is interesting to note that Wentzel used as well Sommerfeld’s technique
(Sommerfeld 1916) in his 1926 paper on multiply-periodic systems within the new quantum
mechanics (Wentzel 1926). See also Stueckelberg’s paper “Sur l’int´egration de l’´equation

The matrix element Ω(p) is obviously Lorentz invariant. It is also invariant

electrons are on mass-shell. The ﬁrst two terms with denominators contain
the contribution of intermediate states whereas the last term corresponds to
the direct interaction. It is important to realize that Stueckelberg didn’t need
to modify the overall scheme of iteration to achieve this result; such is not the
case with the previous (Dirac theory) where a reﬁnement of the perturbative
method had to be made to obtain a contribution through intermediate states
(see section on Dirac’s perturbation theory).98

Equation (81) is a witness to the modernity of Stueckelberg’s approach,
since one had to wait until 1948 to ﬁnd similar expressions. Ω is actually
identical (except for normalizations) to the corresponding factor given by

The steps above illustrate the iteration method of Stueckelberg.
We now pass to the discussion of Stueckelberg’s method for calculating the
cross-section. It starts with the deﬁnition of ”on mass-shell wave-functions”.
We ﬁrst introduce the on mass-shell 4-momentum, denoted by

ek′.

Then χ(0)(p) satisﬁes (77) if ω(0)(¯p) obeys

0−

Notice that p2 + M 2 = ¯p2
p2
0 which makes explicit the singularity of (83) in
the energy variable p0. The reason of this special way in which Stueckelberg
expresses the solution of (77) is the following. It is diﬀerent from zero only for
those values of p where the ¯p2
0 = p2 + M 2. Elsewhere, it vanishes. The form
of (83) with its explicit singularity makes it possible to write both cases in a
single closed form, which is then suitable for being reinserted into interation
steps. Each order of iteration will add a new singularity the impact of which
being crucial during contour-integration. The information about the values of
p where the non-trivial solution is valid is then retrieved by complex contour-
integration around the singularity (This feature of Stueckelberg’s method is
quite original and contributes to the full automatism of his perturbative
calculus99). For instance, in the ﬁrst order term there are two poles

from χ(0)(p) (there is a third pole in Ω(p),see (81), which does not contribute
for the same reason as above) To integrate over the complex p′

6.3 The spinor case

We are now in a position to review Stueckelberg’s 1934 paper for spin 1/2
electrons. The essential complication with respect to the scalar case above is
the necessity to take into account the spin degrees of freedom. Furthermore,
Stueckelberg generalizes slightly the formalism in order to derive an expres-
sion which is then suitable to be applied to Compton scattering and also to
Bremsstrahlung and pair production. The starting point is now the Dirac
equation for the spinor wave-function Ψ(x)100

6.4 Lorentz and gauge invariant squared matrix ele-

ment Ω†Ω

A systematic feature of Stueckelberg’s 1934 paper is the care he takes to make
the Lorentz and gauge invariance manifest. This is particularly the case for
Ω†Ω, the square of the transition matrix element function of the polarizations
ek and ek′ of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. In his calculation, Stueckelberg consid-
ers a ﬁnal photon which is on mass-shell and transverse, i.e. k′2 = k′
ek′ = 0.
·
On the other hand, he keeps terms proportional to k2 and k
ek. This allows
him to use his formulas also for Bremsstrahlung (see below). For Compton
scattering he will of course put also k2 = k

ek = 0.

·

Stueckelberg now calculates Ω†Ω with the help of eq. (106). We have
shown above that the sum over ﬁnal spins is taken care of. What remains to
be done is to apply the free Dirac equation for ω(¯p), the mass shell conditions
for the initial and ﬁnal electrons and the energy momentum conservation in
order to obtain a simpler expression. In the end he uses the formula

·

ω(¯p)†γ0γµω(¯p) =

.

In the case of Compton scattering, Stueckelberg’s result was obtained

later by Wannier 1935, taking traces of Dirac matrices.

As Stueckelberg pointedly remarks, checking this invariance prevents al-
gebraic errors. Indeed, if one specializes (114) to a transverse photon k, and
compares the result with Eq. 11-13 p.231 of Jauch-Rohrlich 1955, one ﬁnds
an error in the latter109. As already mentioned, Stueckelberg’s insistence
on gauge invariance was rather unusual at the time of his paper. Where
the gauge is not ﬁxed from the beginning (as Fermi’s 1932 or Heitler’s 1936
choice of the Coulomb gauge e0 = 0 ), it is merely noticed. Again, the virtue
of Eq. (114) is its generality. Since the signs of p0 and p′
0 are not ﬁxed, the
formula can be used, besides for Compton scattering and Bremsstrahlung,
to discuss pair production and annihilation110.

107In order not to overload the notations we skipped in the above formula the ”bars” on
p and p′.
108The invariance under the ﬁrst transformation holds even oﬀ mass-shell k2
= 0, when
the photon is coupled to a conserved current, and the electrons are on mass.shell (we thank
M. Veltman for pointing out this result to us).
109On p. 233 the authors however claim that their equation (11-13) is gauge invariant.
Therefore the missing factor 2 in the last term of the ﬁrst line must be a misprint.
110Franz 1938 gives the matrix elements for arbitrary polarizations of the photon and
the electron, in the electron rest-system. See also Nishina 1929a,b.

6.5 Pauli 1933 : Klein-Nishina formula for moving elec-

trons

An obvious application of Stueckelberg’s relativistic formalism was to answer
a question raised by Pauli . At that time, discrepancies were found between
the Klein-Nishina formula for Compton scattering and experimental data
for high energy incoming photons (see Schweber 1994 p.82). As we noted
before, all Compton scattering calculations for spin 1/2 electrons done before
Stueckelberg were performed in the rest system of the initial electron. Pauli
asked the question whether the K-N formula was still valid in the limit where
the initial and ﬁnal light frequencies ν and ν′ go to inﬁnity, their ratio being
kept constant. To this end he Lorentz-transformed the K
N formula from
the rest system of the initial electron to one with arbitrary velocity ~v. Taking
then the above limit, he found that the cross-section depended explicitly
on ~v. His very elegant calculation nevertheless took ﬁve pages, whereas
Stueckelberg could very easily specialize his formula to this case.

6.6 Bremsstrahlung

Bremsstrahlung is the emission of a free photon by an electron interacting
with the Coulomb ﬁeld of a nucleus. It is thus analogous to Compton scatter-
ing, where the initial photon (say k) is replaced by a classical electromagnetic
ﬁeld111

Ak =

2~c
e2 Mkek cos(k
4πZe2

In a particular reference system, where k0 = 0, Mk is the Fourier trans-
form of the Coulomb potential Ze2/r of a nucleus. ek is again a polarization
vector.

Mk =

(123)

x)

·

111That’s why in the formula (103) Pk is put to 1.

64

To treat this problem, the strategy of Stueckelberg is to deﬁne what he
calls the generalized Klein-Nishina formula. To this end he replaces Vk√Nk
by Mk (k2
= 0 ) everywhere in the calculation for Compton
scattering leading to the K-N formula. His aim is then to deduce the formula
for Bremsstrahlung from this generalized K-N formula. In particular, he uses
Eq. (114) whith one photon oﬀ mass-shell.

= 0, (ek ·

k)

Previously to Stueckelberg, the formula for Bremsstrahlung in the electro-
static ﬁeld was obtained by Bethe-Heitler 1934 and by Sauter 1934 in second
order of perturbation theory. On the other hand, Williams and v. Weizs¨acker
1934, using qualitative arguments, found an approximate formula which for
large initial energy Ee of the electron and large energy compared with mc2of
the emitted photon, agrees with the Bethe-Heitler-Sauter formula. The idea
of v. Weizs¨acker-Williams, inspired by Fermi 1924, goes as follows:

In the rest-system of the nucleus the Fourier transform of the static ﬁeld

is given by

V L =

1
(2π)3

Z

d4kδ(k0)Mk(ek ·

k)ei(k·x)

(125)

Since Ee ≫

the rest- system of the electron, the partial waves of (125) move with velocity
~V = -~v.
is almost equal to the light velocity c, and the partial waves for
small k2 are almost transverse ((ek ·
k) ∼= 0). v. Weizs¨acker-Williams apply
to these quasi-lightwaves the Klein-Nishina formula for electrons at rest. The
Bremsstrahlung, calculated in this frame, appears as an incoherent sum of
the scattering amplitudes of the individual partial waves k. This can be
justiﬁed by the fact that one averages over wave-packets large in comparison
with the nuclear ﬁeld.

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

In his 1934 paper, Stueckelberg shows that the Bethe-Heitler formula for
Bremsstrahlung, exact to second order, can be deduced from the generalized
K-N formula in the same way as the approximation for large velocities was
deduced by v. Weizs¨acker-Williams from the ordinary K-N formula112.

Here too, Stueckelberg takes advantage of the manifest relativistic and
gauge invariance of his formalism, which allows him to go back and forth be-
tween the nucleus rest-system (B-H-S formula) and the electron rest-system
(v. W-W formula). For example, to go from the former to the latter, a
gauge transformation is used from a polarization with only a time compo-
nent, to one with only space components. Finally, Stueckelberg shows that

112In Stueckelberg 1935b the same idea was used to obtain the formula for pair creation
by a fast electron in the ﬁeld of a nucleus

65

the incoherent addition of the contributions of partial waves is rigorously
justiﬁed.

6.7

Invariant averaging over photon polarization113

In section 6.4 we mentioned Stueckelberg’s derivation of the Pauli formula
for Compton scattering by moving electrons. After the publication of Stueck-
elberg’s paper, Pauli pointed out to Stueckelberg that he ﬁrst averaged over
the photon polarization in the rest system of the electron, and only then
Lorentz-transformed it back to the moving frame.

Stueckelberg replies to Pauli’s objection by remarking that, since unpolar-
ized light is a Lorentz-invariant notion, the averaging is a Lorentz-invariant
operation and can therefore be performed in any reference system.

Nevertheless, in the 1935 paper, Stueckelberg shows that one can average
in a way which exhibits manifest invariance from the beginning. Instead of
relating the polarization ek to the potential A through

the idea is to use the anti-symmetric ﬁeld-strength tensor F and its conjugate
(dual) ˜F (corresponding to the usual electric and magnetic ﬁelds).

the new four-vectors ǫ and ˆǫ have the right properties to express the polariza-
tion, since they are mutually orthogonal and orthogonal to k. On the other
hand, with the old polarizations ek, these orthogonality properties cannot be
ensured in a Lorentz invariant way.

7 The response to Stueckelberg’s paper

Stueckelberg’s 1934 paper, as well as others where he followed the same
method, did not get much attention. The ﬁrst paper which referred to it was
Wannier (1935). He mentioned that his result for the trace over spinor indices
has also been obtained by Stueckelberg in his eq. (114). But Stueckelberg’s
calculus is for instance not mentioned by Heitler 1936. This could be an
illustration of the diﬀerence of ”styles” of Heitler and Stueckelberg. While
the ﬁrst tries to get as simple expressions as possible, ready for applications,
the second is more interested in the general structure of the theory with
an emphasis on symmetries and other fundamental principles. Strangely
enough, even Wentzel, who suggested the idea of Stueckelberg’s work, never
quoted it.

Pauli had certainly noticed the 1934 paper, since, as discussed above,
Stueckelberg 1935 wrote a sequel on a Lorentz-covariant polarization vector
answering the criticism of Pauli (see preceding section). Later on, in a letter
to Heisenberg (5 February 1937), Pauli drew Heisenberg’s attention to the
1934 paper115:

115Zum Formalismus der St¨orungstheorie m¨ochte ich Dich noch auf eine Arbeit von

67

I would also like to draw your attention to a work of Stueckel-
berg concerning the formalism of perturbation theory. The paper
is not well written, but the basic idea (due to Wentzel) seems rea-
sonable to me; it consists in making evident the relativistic invari-
ance by eliminating space and time completely from the theory
and examining directly the coeﬃcients of the four -dimensional
Fourier expansion of the wave function.116

After the 1939-45 war, a whole new era started in quantum ﬁeld theory
with the renormalization program. In his report to the Solvay congress 1948,
J. R. Oppenheimer insists on the necessity to preserve covariance in all steps
of the calculation if one wants to eliminate the inﬁnities. As an example of
such a covariant theory he quotes Stueckelberg’s paper.

Now it is true that the fundamental equations of quantum-
electrodynamics are gauge and Lorentz covariant. But they have
in a strict sense no solutions expansible in powers of e.
If one
wishes to explore these solutions, bearing in mind that certain
inﬁnite terms will, in a later theory, no longer be inﬁnite, one
needs a covariant way of identifying these terms, and for that,
not merely the ﬁeld equations themselves, but the whole method
of approximation and solution must at all stages preserve covari-
ance. This means that the familiar Hamiltonian methods, which
imply a ﬁxed Lorentz frame t=constant, must be renounced; nei-
ther Lorentz frame nor gauge can be speciﬁed until after, in a
given order in e, all terms have been identiﬁed, and those bearing
on the deﬁnition of charge and mass recognized and relegated;
then of course, in the actual calculation of transition probabili-
ties and the reactive corrections to them, or in the determination
of stationary states in ﬁelds which can be treated as static, and
in the reactive corrections thereto, the introduction of a deﬁnite
coordinate system and gauge for these no longer singular and
completely well-deﬁned terms can lead to no diﬃculty.

It is probable that, at least to order e2, more than one co-
variant formalism can be developed. Thus Stueckelberg’s four-

Stueckelberg aufmerksam machen. Die Arbeit ist nicht sehr gut geschrieben, aber die
zu Grunde liegende Idee (die auf Wentzel zur¨uckgeht) scheint mir vern¨unftig; Sie besteht
darin, die relativistische Invarianz dadurch in Evidenz zu setzen, dass man Raum und
Zeit ganz aus der Theorie entfernt und die Koeﬃzienten der vier- dimensionalen Fourier-
Entwicklung der Wellenfunktion direkt untersucht. (Pauli 1937).
116On Wentzel’s inﬂuence on Stueckelberg see section 6.1.

dimensional perturbation theory would seem to oﬀer a suitable
starting point, as also do the related algorithms of Feynman117.

In the same spirit F. J. Dyson (1949) comments in the notes added in
proof to his paper ”The Radiation Theories of Tomonaga, Schwinger, and
Feynman”: ”A covariant perturbation theory similar to that of section III
has previously been developped by E.C.G. Stueckelberg” referring to the 1934
paper and to Nature vol. 153 (1944), p. 143.

We have already mentioned Weisskopf’s reminiscences (section 6.1). The
importance of manifest Lorentz and gauge invariance for the development of
the theory in these times has been also emphasized by Pais 1986, p. 457.
When commenting on Schwinger’s Lorentz invariant 1948 calculation of vari-
ous terms contributing to the Lamb shift, Pais writes:”Schwinger’s direct cal-
culation of the electric term produced a most unpleasant surprise, however:
it was too small by a factor 1/3 !”118 Pais continues by quoting Schwinger:

This diﬃculty is attributable to the incorrect transformation
properties of the electron self-energy in the conventional Hamil-
tonian treatment and is completely removed in the covariant for-
malism now employed.119

Pais concludes with the following discussion:

How can a fully covariant theory yield non-covariant results?
Because during the calculation one has to subtract inﬁnity from
inﬁnity, which in general is not a well-deﬁned step. How can
one hope to avoid non-covariant answers? By computing in such
a way that covariance is manifest at every stage; and likewise
for gauge invariance. Take, for example, Heisenberg and Pauli’s
treatment of quantum electrodynamics in the Coulomb gauge
which [...] may not look covariant but is covariant nevertheless.
It is not, however, manifestly covariant at every stage. Thus the
Coulomb gauge does not lend itself (readily) to the evaluation
of radiative corrections. Likewise the second order perturbation
formula [...] and its higher-order partners, though actually co-
variant, are not manifestly so. One can, however, cast them in

119Schwinger (1949).

69

an equivalent manifestly covariant form, as in fact Stueckelberg
had already shown in 1934.120

Finally this opinion of Gell-Mann 1989 (p. 702):

By about 1950 it was known that QED is renormalizable for
charged spinor particles [...] The second order renormalizability
of the charge in QED had been established in 1934 by Dirac and
Heisenberg, and that of the mass by a number of authors in 1948.
Of those, the ﬁrst ones to complete correct relativistic calculations
of the Lamb shift (Willis Lamb and Norman Kroll and J. Bruce
French and Victor Weisskopf) actually used the clumsy old non-
covariant method. The place where the new covariant methods
played a crucial role, particulary those of E.C.G. Stueckelberg and
Richard P. Feynman, which are still used today, was in permitting
calculations to be done quickly, especially to fourth and higher
orders (which would have been impractical with the old methods),
and in making possible the proof of renormalizability to all orders.

So, after all, why didn’t people take advantage of Stueckelberg’s method.
? Several reasons could be proposed. The paper itself was certainly not
written in a transparent style (remember Weisskopf’s and Pauli’s comments).
His notations were clumsy (see our appendix). On the other hand, some of
the mathematical features of Stueckelberg’s theory (contour integrals instead
of Dirac’s delta function) could have made it unfamiliar to use. Also, more
generally, the paper didn’t provide a new physical result but ”only” a new
method for deriving results already obtained; no one realised (see Weisskopf’s
reminiscences) that it could have been used to treat in a more consistent way
the unsolved divergence diﬃculties.

120In his book (p. 244-45), S. S. Schweber reports on the other hand this revealing
reaction of Schwinger when asked about the disparities between his calculation of the
Lamb shift and that of French and Weisskopf: ”Well, if you do not keep the calculation
explicitely covariant, anything can happen”.

We shall address the general problem of renormalization in Quantum Field Theory and

9 Appendix

In order to make easier the comparison between the various works considered
in this paper, we have adopted a set of conventions that we systematically
use when discussing the technical details. The necessary changes in notations
or conventions with respect to the original papers are of minor importance,
but for the sake of historical accuracy, we report below the main alterations.
Four-vectors are written in normal type, with their spatial part noted in
boldface: and the time-component a0; thus a = (a1, a2, a3, a0) = (a,a0). In
particular, the space-time location of an event is given by the four-vector
(x,ct) where the time-component x0 = ct and c is the speed of light in
vacuum. Our relativistic metric is given by the matrix gµν with gii =
g00 =
1, i = 1, 2, 3. All the authors we consider adopt instead the euclidean metric,
introducing for each time-component a0 its euclidean counterpart a4 = ia0.
Thus, the space-time scalar product between two four-vectors a and b is in
aµbµ where the sum convention has been used
our notation a

in the last expression. Clearly, a

An electromagnetic plane wave ψ of angular frequency ω = 2πν, wave-

The wave vectors of the initial and ﬁnal radiation are noted respectively

ˆk and ˆk′, and in general quantities related to the ﬁnal state are primed.

The original notations of Stueckelberg appear quite unusual (which cer-
tainly doesn’t help the reader...). We present now a dictionary for going from
his to our notations.

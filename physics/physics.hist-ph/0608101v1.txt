The road not considered ... the question
of photon mass

It is well-known that a conﬂict between Galilean relativity and Maxwell equations
of electromagnetic equations was apparent by the end of the 19th century. Equally
well-known is the fact that Einstein resolved the conﬂict by pointing out that the
principle of relativity and Maxwell equations can both be correct if the notion of
absolute time is abandoned. The rest is history. The purpose of this article is not to
recount that history. Rather, we wonder about a question which, it seems, should
have been asked in the process, but apparently was not.

Newtonian formulation of dynamics was ﬁrmly established by the nineteenth
century, proving its worth in all sorts of questions that were addressed within its
framework. Einstein’s introduction of Special Theory of Relativity required a refor-
mulation of the laws of dynamics. Newtonian dynamics became only an approxi-
mation, valid in the regime of small speeds. Maxwell equation of electrodynamics,
however, remained unaﬀected.

And this is where the question comes.

In the times of great upheavals, it is
natural to re-examine everything conventional. Newtonian dynamics was indeed
re-examined and replaced by a more sophiticated alternative with the advent of
special relativity. Why wasn’t there any serious discussion about any modiﬁcation
or reformulation of Maxwell equations at the same time?

It almost seems like a vain question. Wasn’t the entire conﬂict created by the
presence of the quantity c in Maxwell equations, implying that the speed of electro-
magnetic waves in the vacuum is independent of the observer? And didn’t Einstein
absorb this statement as a postulate in his system, thus assuming the immutability
of Maxwell equations in the basic structure of his Special Theory?

Yes, it is undeniable that the Maxwell equations contained a fundamental quan-
tity which has the dimension of velocity. This is most apparent if we write the
equations in Gaussian units, where the electric and the magnetic ﬁelds are assumed

Note that we have written the equations in absence of any source, which is all that
we will need in this article. The constant c, carrying the dimension of velocity,
explicitly appears even in the absence of sources.

In other systems of units, this constant may be hidden. For example, if we
write down the Maxwell equation involving the sources in SI units, the equations
apparently contain two “fundamental” constants ε0 and µ0, called respectively the
permittivity and permeability of free space, and none of them have the dimension
of velocity. However, there is nothing fundamental about the ratio ε0/µ0: it merely
serves to set the relative units between the charge density and the current density.
If no source is present, only the combination ε0µ0 appears in the Maxwell equations,
and it is easily seen that this combination has the dimension of inverse velocity
squared. In fact, it equals the quantity 1/c2, where c appears in Eqs. (3) and (4)
written in the Gaussian system of units.

It therefore follows that this quantity c is a fundamental constant, and it should
therefore be observer-independent, and Einstein boldly recognized this fact by ex-
tending the Galilean principle of relativity to it. But should this c be the speed of
the electromagnetic waves?

The answer is ‘yes’ if one accepts Eqs. (1–4) without any modiﬁcation anywhere,
as we all learn from textbooks on electromagnetic theory. This is trivial to see. We
merely have to take the curls of the last two equations, applying the vector calculus
identity

which holds for any diﬀerentiable vector ﬁeld V . After that, using Eqs. (1) and (2),
we readily obtain

which are wave equations, with the speed of the waves equal to c. Since c is a
universal constant, Eqs. (6) and (7) imply that the speed of electromagnetic waves
is independent of its wavelength. In other words, the vacuum must be a dispersion-
free background for the propagation of electromagnetic waves.

This is where the question comes. Didn’t that look awkward to anyone in the
beginning of the twentieth century? The phenomenon of dispersion was known since
Newton’s famous experiment with prism, and in the long experience since then, no
one has ever encountered a medium that is dispersion-free. So, why didn’t the
idea of a dispersion-free vacuum appear outrageous? Instead, wouldn’t it have been
more natural to suppose that the quantity c that appears in the Maxwell equations is
invariant, but it is not the speed of the electromagnetic waves, and that the Maxwell
equations somehow have to be modiﬁed so that Eqs. (6) and (7) do not follow from
them?

The question becomes more poignant in the light of the fact that in 1905, Einstein
also worked with the hypothesis of light quanta or photons. From his pioneering
paper on the special theory of relativity, he already knew that for a particle of mass∗
m, the relation between energy and momentum is given by

Using Hamilton’s dynamical equations, one can then easily deduce that for a given
momentum, the velocity of the particle is given by

E2 = p2c2 + m2c4 .

v =

∂E
∂p

=

pc
√p2 + m2c2 .

(9)

This shows two things about the magnitude of velocity. First, it depends on the
magnitude of momentum, which means that there is dispersion. Second, the mag-
nitude of velocity is less than c for any non-zero value of the mass. In order to agree
with the dispersionless speed of electromagnetic waves obtained from Eqs. (6) and
(7), one therefore has to conclude that m = 0, i.e., the photons are massless.

A century has passed since the publication of Einstein’s papers on special rela-
tivity and light quanta. In these hundred years, we have grown so accustomed to
this statement about the masslessness of the photon that we seldom realize that it
must have been a mysterious statement in those days, and is no less mysterious now.
All known material particles have some mass. The speed of any particle depends
on its momentum. Any particle can be at rest with respect to a given observer.
If we want to think of photons as particles, it is natural to assign the same set of
properties to them. And yet, this supposedly “natural” road was never considered.
Why not? We discuss possible answers to this question in the rest of this article.

Certainly the phenomenological success of the electromagnetic theory was not
the reason behind the supposed immutability of Maxwell’s equations. After all,
Newtonian mechanics also had tremendous phenomenological success, and was in
∗In older texts on relativity, this quantity was called the “rest mass”, in order to distinguish it
from the ratio E/c2 of a moving particle. I will follow the modern use of the term “mass”, which
signiﬁes a Lorentz invariant property, equal to E0/c2, where E0 is the energy of the particle at
rest.

fact tested for a much longer time in history. So, if Newtonian mechanics could have
been modiﬁed, Maxwellian electrodynamics could have been challenged as well.

One might be tempted to think that the Maxwell equations embodied the beau-
tiful structure of gauge invariance, and no one would have tried to modify the equa-
tions and spoil the gauge invariance. This seems to be a very unlikely explanation.
In 1905, the idea of the photon was just coming into light (no pun intended). Quan-
tum electrodynamics (QED) was still a few decades away into the future. There
was no way to guess that gauge invariance would play an important role in QED.
As far as classical physics was concerned, gauge invariance was only a mathematical
curiosity, which was useful only in solving the diﬀerential equations of electrody-
namics with less trouble. There was no big physical signiﬁcance attached to the
idea of gauge invariance, and therefore no physicist treasured the idea as something
very fundamental.

A third guess would be the following. Einstein had to use the idea of the con-
stancy of the speed of light, because he used it to develop the entire structure of
special relativity, starting from the relativity of simultaneity. This is the basic reason
why he, and others of his time, did not want to disturb the equation for electro-
magnetic wave given in Eqs. (6) and (7). The sentiment is understandable, but
this was not the only logical possibility. As we emphasized earlier, Maxwell’s equa-
tions necessarily contained one constant which has the dimension of velocity. It was
a bold decision to acknowledge that this fundamental quantity must be observer-
independent, and this was the big step taken by Einstein. Once this step is taken, it
is trivial to argue from there that the concept of time must be observer-dependent,
and this was the second step that Einstein took. But after that, one can just use the
principle of relativity, and some basic axioms like that of the homogeneity of space
and time, to arrive at [1] the Lorentz transformation equations and the relativistic
velocity addition rule. One needs to use the fact that c is a constant, but nowhere
one has to identify it with the speed of light in the vacuum.

Let us then explore how Maxwell’s equation could have been modiﬁed. We will
assume that the modiﬁed equation would still be linear in the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds, and we will keep considering the sourceless equations. One possibility is to
keep the divergence equations, Eqs. (1) and (2), unchanged, and modify the curl
equations:

where η1, η2, ξ1, ξ2 are constants which cannot be independent, as will be discussed
soon. Taking the curls of these two equations and using Eq. (5), we obtain

This is a mess, and a similar mess occurs if we try to ﬁnd the equation contain-
ing second derivatives of the magnetic ﬁeld. First, the equations are coupled in
electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Second, they contain ﬁrst order time derivative terms,
which would produce damped solutions which should not occur in absence of any
dissipation. Fortunately, curing the second problem is easily done by choosing

And then we note that it automatically cures the ﬁrst problem. However, even after
this, the equation turns out to be

Since the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are real, the constants η1, η2 must also be
real.
In this case, Eq. (15) gives unphysical solutions. For example, if a ﬁeld is
homogeneous, Eq. (15) says that its magnitude must be exponentially increasing or
decreasing in the vacuum. This does not make any sense.

So let us try something diﬀerent. Again, we will modify two of the four equations

of Eqs. (1–4), but this time we choose a diﬀerent grouping.
sources, it would aﬀect only two of the four equations. The other two, viz., Eqs.
(2) and (3), are just constraint equations that the electric and magnetic ﬁelds must
satisfy. Let us keep these constraints equations undisturbed, but modify the other
two by writing

where obviously f is a scalar and F is a vector. Note that these are not the sources.
We have written the equation in the vacuum, where there are no sources, and we
assumed that even then there are some other terms in the equation. We will soon
comment on the nature of these terms.

We can take the curl of both sides of Eq. (17), use the identity of Eq. (5) and

then Eq. (2) to write

What needs to be done if we want to obtain a meaningful wave equation for the
magnetic ﬁeld? Obviously, we want the right hand side to be proportional to B.

The proportionality constant must have the dimension of inverse length squared. If
this constant is positive, we get into the kind of problems discussed in connection
with Eq. (15). Therefore, we want

where ℓ is a constant carrying the dimension of length, and the equation for the
magnetic ﬁeld in the vacuum becomes

The same equation would be satisﬁed by the electric ﬁeld as well, provided we
identify

Purely within the purview of classical physics, this would have opened a new
Pandora’s box. It would seem that now we are in the need of a fundamental quantity
with the dimension of length. But since Einstein already possessed the idea of a
light quantum, that was not really necessary.
In fact, with the help of Planck’s
constant, one could have written

ℓ =

¯h
mc

,

where m is something with the dimension of mass. And this mass need not have
been any fundamental constant: it could have been interpreted as the mass of the
photon.

So, to come back to the question: why wasn’t this modiﬁcation of Maxwellian
electrodynamics put to test? Although there is no way to be sure about the answer,
one can make a strong guess. Remember that the homogeneous Maxwell equa-
tions have been kept unchanged in this formulation, so we can deﬁne the potentials
through the usual relations:

Now, looking back at Eqs. (19) and (21), we realize that

Thus the modiﬁed Maxwell equations would contain the scalar and the vector po-
tentials.

This is something that would have seemed like a complete catastrophe for a
physicist in 1905. As we already said, the potentials were supposed to be only

mathematical constructs which could help solve the dynamical equations. They
were not supposed to enter any equation of physical signiﬁcance. And maybe that
is why modiﬁcation of Maxwell equations in the line described above was never
considered.

This is not to say that no modiﬁcation of Maxwellian electrodynamics was at all
considered at the time when special relativity was introduced. Indeed, there was the
emission theory of Ritz [2] and others. But they violated Lorentz transformation
equations. And it is understandable that, having obtained the Lorentz transforma-
tion equations and having them justiﬁed by Einstein’s eﬀort, it was physchologically
not easy to discard them altogether. We raise the question about a milder alter-
native: the Lorentz transformation equations are not disturbed, but the quantity c
that appears in them is not the speed of light in the vacuum.

The reader must have noticed that we have always stuck to the principles and the
machinery available to a physicist of 1905, and not any hindsight that has developed
since that time. For example, the modiﬁcation attempted in Eqs. (10) and (11) can
easily be discarded today, by noting that the modiﬁed equations cannot be expressed
in a covariant 4-dimensional notation. On the other hand, the modiﬁcation intro-
duced through Eqs. (16) and (17) do have a simple representation in 4-dimensional
notation, and are indeed the ﬁeld equations derived from the Proca Lagrangian [3].
In modern day language, the question raised in this article can be summarized in
this form: why was the Proca equation introduced as late as in 1930? Why didn’t
one start from the Proca equations right in 1905 and allowed the photon mass to be
determined by experiments? Of course, even at the outset anyone would have known
that the photon mass must be very small, and further experiments could have been
designed to know the mass better. Indeed, a very similar path has been pursued
for neutrinos. Though at ﬁrst it was proposed that neutrinos are massless, soon
after the possibility of its mass was taken seriously, experiments were performed to
determine the mass, and through decades of eﬀort we now know that neutrino mass,
albeit very small compared to all other known fermion masses, is indeed non-zero.
This program, which seemed very logical and pragmatic, was not undertaken for the
photon at the beginning of the twentieth century, when a lot of thought went into
the nature of light and electromagnetic theory. Of course, data collected for other
reasons were used later to put bounds on photon mass [4].

There is an interesting irony in these set of events. Quantum theory developed
quite independently of special relativity. We can fantasize over things that could
have happened if, instead of beginning their journeys almost at the same time in the
hands of Einstein, quantum theory had started much before the theory of relativity.
What if relativity ﬂourished after the Aharanov-Bohm theory and the experiments
to conﬁrm it, which showed that electromagnetic potential, even in the absence of
electromagnetic ﬁeld, can aﬀect outcomes of physical experiments? Probably in
such circumstances, no one would consider the presence of potentials in equations

7

of motion outrageous, and the question of photon mass would have been raised with
the advent of relativity theory.

On hindsight, however, it seems good that things happened the way they did.
With the advent of quantum theory, it was recognized that gauge invariance might
serve as a crucial ingredient in constructing the quantum theory of electromagnetic
interactions or QED. Even later, it was recognized that the same principle, suitably
generalized, holds the key to the construction of gauge theories, which now describe
the theories of strong and weak interactions as well. It would have been a pity if
gauge invariance, present in Maxwell’s equations, was sacriﬁced by introducing the
possibility of a photon mass.

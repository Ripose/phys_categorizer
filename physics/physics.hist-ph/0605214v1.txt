Many theoretical predictions derived from quantum mechanics have been con-
ﬁrmed experimentally during the last 80 years. However, interpretative aspects
have long been subject to debate. Among them, the question of the existence
of hidden variables is still open. We review these questions, paying special at-
tention to historical aspects, and argue that one may deﬁnitively exclude local
realism on the basis of present experimental outcomes. Other interpretations of
Quantum Mechanics are nevertheless not excluded.

6. Discussion

1. Motivations

According to Mermin, contemporary physicists come in two varieties: those who
are bothered by EPR arguments and Bell’s theorem and those, perhaps the majority,
who are not. In general, physicists who are not troubled by the kind of arguments
used in the orthodox interpretation focus their attention on the technical part of
quantum mechanics and on its unquestionable successes. This positive attitude leads
most of the time to a kind of “operational realism” and to a complete disinterest
regarding other interpretations. The present paper is a collection of lectures given
at the Mochima summer school and at the university Henri Poincar´e in Nancy. The
aim of these lectures was to engage students and colleagues full of certitudes, in a
discussion on some of the arguments bothering some contemporary physicists. It is
a short, superﬁcial and non-exhaustive review of the kind of questions that part of
the community is dealing with.

In orthodox quantum mechanics a system is fully characterised by its wave func-
tion. However, in 1935 Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) argued that such a
theory is not complete, in the sense that not every element of reality has a coun-
terpart in the theory. Bohr’s reply underlined the fact that the EPR argumentation
is misleading, since the interaction of the system with the experimental set-up is
not taken into account. We discuss ﬁrstly the reality assumption in the celebrated
debate between Einstein and Bohr.

If not convinced by Bohr’s arguments, one may invoke additional parameters
– the so-called hidden variables – in order to fully account for a system’s proper-
ties. Historically, short after the EPR paper, the quest for hidden-variable theories
weakened because the theorems of von Neumann, Gleason and Kochen as well as

version of November 23, 2013

3

Specker claimed the impossibility of constructing hidden-variable theories reproduc-
ing all the results of quantum mechanics. In fact, these theorems have been shown
to imply that such theories must exhibit contextuality (the dependence of a given
measurement on the experimental set-up), rather than imply that hidden-variable
interpretations are untenable. The subsequent step was Bell’s assertion that any
realistic local hidden-variable theory must satisfy inequalities that are violated by
quantum mechanics. The theorem of von Neumann and the Bell inequalities are
detailed in the third section.

The fourth section summarises the long series of experiments performed – mainly
in quantum optics – since the beginning of the seventies and recently. Step-by-step
improvements of the experimental expertise concerning the creation and manipu-
lation of quantum states have led to the realization of several generations of ex-
periments. These successive experimental tests, focusing essentially on the eﬀort
made to circumvent the locality loophole, favoured orthodox quantum mechanics
and strongly indicates that local hidden-variable theories can be ruled out.

However the hidden-variable theories in general have not been disqualiﬁed. For
example, the non-local Bohmian mechanics still holds. This theory, which can be
considered as a successful construction of hidden-variable theory, is described in the
ﬁfth section. It is empirically equivalent to orthodox quantum theory.

We stress that we made no attempt at an exhaustive reference to the (vast)

literature in the ﬁeld. Interested readers may refer to recent reviews, e.g. Ref. [1].

2. 1935: the reality assumptions in Quantum Mechanics

In a seminal paper published in 1935 [2], Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR)
pointed out a tricky question about the epistemological interpretation of quantum
mechanics. Their objection is supposed to prove the incompleteness of the theory
with respect to physical reality. According to quantum mechanics, all the physical
available information concerning a system is encoded in its wave function. If that
was not the case, as argued by EPR in their paper, one would have to search for a
more satisfying (complete) theory which would encompass quantum mechanics.

2.1. EPR assumptions

According to EPR, in a complete theory, “every element of the physical reality
must have a counterpart in the physical theory”. This condition requires an exper-
imental speciﬁcation in order to identify such an “element of the physical reality”.
Thus, EPR propose a suﬃcient criterion for their following argumentation: “if, with-
out in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e. with a prob-
ability equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element
of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity”.

Consider a particle in a momentum eigenstate,

[i.e. with a wave function
exp(ip0r/~)]. The momentum being p0 with certainty, it is then meaningful
ψ
to consider that it is an element of the physical reality associated with the particle.

On the other hand, the location of the particle is not determined in the state
,
i
since all possible values of the coordinate are equally likely. Certainly, one may pro-
ceed to a direct measurement. But this measurement would perturb the state of the
particle in such a way that once the coordinate is known, the particle is no longer
in the state
and the precise knowledge of its momentum is lost. One thus has
to conclude that “when the momentum of a particle is known, its coordinate has no
physical reality”, since it does not satisfy the reality criterion. This example may be
generalised to any observables ˆP and ˆQ which do not commute, since the correspond-
ing physical quantities P and Q are subject to Heisenberg inequalities according to
which one cannot know P and Q simultaneously with arbitrary accuracy. According
to EPR, two alternatives follow: either (1) “the quantum-mechanical description of
reality given by the wave function is not complete” or (2) [the quantum description
is complete, but] “when the operators corresponding to two physical quantities do
not commute the two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality”.

2.2. Incompleteness of quantum mechanics

EPR consider that the second alternative leads to an inconsistency. For this pur-
pose, assume a system of two particles 1 and 2 initially prepared without interaction,
so that the wave function of the system is the product of two wave functions, the ﬁrst
one depending on the physical properties associated with particle 1, the other de-
pending on the physical properties of particle 2. Suppose now that the two particles
start to interact during a ﬁnite time. According to Schr¨odinger equation, the wave
function of the system is known at any time during and after the interaction. But
usually, due the interaction term, a mixing occurs and the wave function no longer
appears as a product having the properties of the original one. The announced in-
consistency arises from this entanglement of the particles state. A simple illustration
of such an entangled state has been given by David Bohm [3], using two-state phys-
ical quantities. Consider a molecule made of two spin 1/2 atoms. The molecule is
supposed to be prepared in a singlet state of total spin, s = 0, represented by the
entangled state

It follows that a further measurement of the spin component S2x of atom 2 leads to

We must conclude that in both cases, since no interaction has perturbed atom 2
since the disintegration, the state vectors . . .
must be associated
with a unique element of reality of this atom. As a consequence, according to the
reality criterion of EPR, both spin components S2z and S2x should be simultaneously
associated with an element of reality concerning atom 2. Since it is well known
that the observables ˆS2z and ˆS2x do not commute ([ ˆS2z, ˆS2x] = i~ ˆS2y), there is
an inconsistency and one should come back to the ﬁrst alternative: “the quantum-
mechanical description of reality given by the wave function is not complete”.

and . . .

In their original paper, EPR pointed out that one would not reach the same
conclusions if, in the reality criterion, one had required physical properties to be
regarded as simultaneous elements of reality “only when they can be simultaneously
measured or predicted ”. In this case, as shown in the previous example, the reality of
the physical properties depends on the experiment achieved on atom 1, but as EPR
concluded, “no reasonable deﬁnition of reality could be expected to permit this”. This
is nevertheless what Bohr would accept.

In their original paper, EPR discuss the example of two particles without inter-
action, prepared in a coordinate- and momentum- entangled state represented by
the wave function

ψ(1, 2) =

exp[i(x1

where X1 is a known constant. The contradiction lies in the fact that a precise
measurement of the momentum of particle 1, p1 = p, ensures that the momentum
p, while a precise measurement of the
of particle 2 is known with certainty, p2 =
coordinate of particle 1, x1 = x, guarantees that particle 2 has coordinate x2 = x
X1
with certainty. Since particle 2 has not been perturbed since the preparation of the
state, one concludes that its momentum and coordinate are known with certainty
at a given time, in contradiction with Heisenberg inequalities.

2One should have obtained this result directly, since the spin of the system 1+2 is zero. As a
consequence, if the spin component of particle 1 is +~/2 along any direction, that of particle 2
along the same axis is

2.3. Bohr’s reply

In his paper of 1935 [4], Bohr reconsiders this example and elaborates upon the
epistemology of complementarity, initiated during the 1927 Como and Bruxelles con-
ference [5]. For that purpose, he points out that the EPR example is realised with a
two-slit Young device. Consider two non-interacting particles 1 and 2 crossing simul-
taneously a two-slit apparatus, not rigidly attached to the support as represented in
Fig. 1. One is then able to measure precisely the coordinate diﬀerence X1 = x1
x2
between the two particles at the time they cross it: this is the distance between
the slits. Measuring furthermore the spring elongation or compression due to the
crossing of the two particles, one is also able to deduce with arbitrary accuracy the

A later precise measurement of the coordinate (x1) or of the momentum (p1) of
particle 1 enables one to deduce the coordinate (x2) or momentum (p2) of particle 2
without in any way perturbing it. But, and this is where the reality criterion of EPR
is unsuitable, one has to make a choice between the two experimental situations.
This choice requires an unambiguous use of the classical concepts needed for the
determination of the physical quantities. Measuring accurately x1 for instance re-
quires a well deﬁned spatial frame in the classical sense, which needs the apparatus
(a single slit aperture for example) to be rigidly ﬁxed to the support that deﬁnes

that reference frame. But in doing so, one drops out further possibility to measure
p1, since the momentum transfer between the particle and the aperture is lost in
the support. How then can an element of reality be associated with p1, and thus
with p2, which are variables originating from classical concepts while we are unable
to perform any measurement of them through the apparatus used, due to the very
existence of the action quantum h. Measuring p1 on the other hand requires an
experimental setup which enables to use classical conservation laws of the momen-
tum transfer between the particle 1 and the apparatus. This may be for instance
the same single slit aperture, but now dissociated from the support, allowing for a
measurement of the momentum through the elongation or compression of a spring.
In doing so, we loose the ability of an accurate measurement of the coordinate x1
(and thus x2), the precise measurement of which requires a ﬁxed frame of reference.
Therefore, according to Bohr, the reality criterion proposed by EPR contains an
essential ambiguity when it is applied to atomic systems, ambiguity which lies in the
words “without in any way disturbing a system”. Of course in the example of EPR,
there is no mechanical perturbation during the critical step of the measurement
process, “but there is essentially the question of an inﬂuence on the very conditions
which deﬁne the possible types of predictions regarding the future behaviour of the
system.” According to Bohr, the EPR argumentation is misleading, since it is based
on the assumption that one may intelligibly speak about the state of a physical sys-
tem, regardless of any experimental setup. This is equivalent to a discourse on the
“the thing in itself”, regardless of external conditions in which it is observed. Accord-
ing to Bohr, what quantum phenomena reveal, thanks to Heisenberg inequalities, is
precisely the inability to deﬁne properties (elements of reality) of a quantum system
without taking into account their interaction with other systems. He proposes a de-
scription of the quantum world in terms of complementarity, a way which although
discussed in terms of classical concepts, accounts for the fact that no separation
between the behaviour of atomic systems and their interaction with measurement
devices is possible. This is complementarity. Wave and particle behaviours of light
and matter are complementary in the sense that when a measurement is performed,
one should use both classical concepts when interpretating in a consistent way the
observed phenomena as a whole.

2.4. Bohm’s further explanations

Although it plays an important role in the argumentation of EPR, Bohr did not
extensively discuss the wave function. We will follow Bohm to provide a complement
to the orthodox interpretation of that point and of the signiﬁcance of observables of
quantum mechanics.

Firstly, one observes that the EPR argumentation is based on two implicit as-
sumptions which are never discussed in the original paper. The ﬁrst one is that
the world may be correctly analysed in terms of distinct elements of reality which
have separate existence. This is the problem of separability, to which we will return
later. Secondly, elements of reality must have a deﬁnite mathematical correspon-
dence in a complete theory. This second statement is in fact only a stronger version

8

of the deﬁnition of elements of reality given by EPR, but it is this stronger version
which is used in the paper, since the element of reality is deﬁned even before the
measurement.

If one rejects both assumptions, which are at the basis of any classical theory,
the paradox disappears. Indeed, orthodox quantum theory assumes that the strong
correspondence stated above emerges at the classical level only. At a quantum level,
mathematical description is provided through the wave function which is not in
strong correspondence with the system, but in a statistical correspondence, although
the wave function provides the most complete possible description of the system. In
order to reconcile both seemingly contradictory aspects of the wave function, one
has to accept that elements of reality of a quantum system do generally exist in
an unprecise way. These are potentialities, likely to be realised when the interac-
tion of the system with a classical measurement device occurs. The wave function
describes the propagation of these correlated potentialities. Hence, concerning two
non-commuting observables, such as the coordinate and the momentum of a particle,
neither of them has a precise and deﬁnite existence. Rather, each of them is likely
to be actualised when interactions with the adequate apparatus takes place. Within
this approach, the characteristics attributed to the observables are not intrinsic to
the subsystem, but rather through their interaction in the complete system.

2.5. Einstein’s point of view on separability

In his correspondence and in further papers published after the EPR article [6],
Einstein clariﬁed his point of view. The simple fact that the wave function describ-
ing particle 2 after measurement made on particle 1 depends on this measure is,
according to him, the sign of incompleteness of quantum theory [7]:

“From the point of view of the [orthodox] interpretation this means that according
to the choice of a complete measurement on S1 a diﬀerent real situation with respect
to S2 is created, which is described through diﬀerently natured ψ2, ψ′

2, ψ′′

2 etc.

From the point of view of quantum mechanics alone this does not present any
diﬃculty. According to the speciﬁc choice of the measurement on S1 a distinct real
situation is created and the necessity, to associate with the system S2 at the same
time two or more distinct wave functions ψ2, ψ′

2, . . ., can never arise.

However, the situation changes if one tries to maintain, simultaneously with the
principles of quantum mechanics, also the Principle of the independent existence of
a real situation in two separated parts R1 and R2 of space. In our example a complete
measurement on S1 means a physical interaction which only concerns the part R1
of space. Such an interaction, however, cannot directly inﬂuence the physical reality
in a part R2 of space which is far away. This would imply that any assertion with
respect to S2 which we could achieve through a complete measurement on S1 must
also be valid for the system S2 when no measurement at all is made on S1. That
would mean that all statement on S2 must be valid which can be derived by specifying
ψ2 or ψ′
2 etc. stand for mutually distinct
real facts of S2, that is one enters in conﬂict with the [orthodox] interpretation of
the ψ-function.

2 etc. This is of course impossible, if ψ2, ψ′

version of November 23, 2013

Without doubt, it appears to me that the physicists which take the description of
quantum mechanics for deﬁnitive in principle, will react to this thought as follows:
they will drop the requirement of the independent existence of the Physical Reality
present in diﬀerent parts of space; they are justiﬁed in pointing out that Quantum
Theory nowhere makes use of this requirement.

I admit this, but point out: if I consider the physical phenomena I know about,
in particular those which are accounted for so successfully by quantum mechanics, I
still ﬁnd nowhere a fact which would make it probable to me that the requirement [of
separability] should be abandoned. I am therefore inclined to believe that in the sense
of [orthodox interpretation] the description of quantum mechanics should be viewed
as an incomplete and indirect description of reality, which will be replaced later by
a complete and direct one.”

2.6. What orthodox physicists should accept, and what others may reject

In 1935 Schr¨odinger cat paradox also appeared. A cat enclosed in a box plays
the role of a measurement apparatus with two macroscopic mutually exclusive out-
comes, dead or alive. The answer is given in modern quantum mechanics through
the concept of quantum decoherence of entangled macroscopic states. This notion
is a bit out of the scope of the present contribution 4, but is required to justify
epistemological completeness of orthodox quantum theory.

As a summary, an orthodox physicist has to admit that physical properties at-
tributed to a quantum system are only potentialities which become physical reality
when interacting with a measurement apparatus. For such a physicist, the concept
of trajectory of a particle is meaningless, unless a device is used to measure it.
He (she) also admits that “nature plays dice”, that is probabilities are inherent to
quantum phenomena. Those who do not share this opinion can invoke some hidden
variables at the origin of probabilities which would then reveal our ignorance of
these variables. In this direction, one has to distinguish between non-local hidden-
variable theories (Bohm - de Broglie theory is the paradigmatic example) and local
hidden-variable theories which are discussed below in this paper. The question of
separability is nevertheless still present.

3. On the impossibility of local hidden variables

3.1. Hidden-variable theories

In classical physics, measurement processes are intuitive: the result of the mea-
surement of any physical observable
is a function of the state of the system,
e.g. the positions ri and the velocities vi for a set a particles. The measurement
gives the same result in all systems identically prepared. For this reason, the

It is tempting, as Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen did, to make the assumption
that the wave function

system. There may exist a set of hidden variables λ, not yet experimentally observed,

Another important diﬀerence to quantum mechanics is that the wave packet reduc-

cannot be fulﬁlled by a hidden-variable theory, which demonstrates according to
him, the impossibility of such a theory. In the following, we give an outline of his
demonstration (for further details, see for instance the excellent dissertation by
D. Hemmick [9] on which this section is based). First, von Neumann showed that

The correctness of the von Neumann demonstration is not questionable but one
may wonder whether the postulate (7) is really necessary. The alternative demon-
stration of the von Neumann theorem provided by Schr¨odinger is helpful to address
this question [10]. Consider a particle in a harmonic potential with Hamiltonian

ˆH =

Since in a given experiment V{|ψi,λ}(ˆx) and V{|ψi,λ}(ˆp) can take any real value, it
is not possible to ensure that V{|ψi,λ}( ˆH) is always equal to one of the discrete
2) of ˆH. Unlike von Neumann, Schr¨odinger questioned the validity
eigenvalues ~ω(n+ 1
of the postulate (7). Indeed, ˆx and ˆp are non-commuting operators, i.e. [ˆx, ˆp] =
i~, which means, according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle, that position and
velocity cannot be measured during the same experiment with arbitrary accuracy.
As a consequence, V{|ψi,λ}(ˆx) and V{|ψi,λ}(ˆp) have no simultaneous meaning. Two
diﬀerent experiments have to be performed to measure both position and velocity.
The postulate (7) is not applicable to non-commuting operators but only to sets of

(10)

(11)

12

commuting ones, i.e. to quantities that can be measured during the same experiment.
Using the same approach than von Neumann, Gleason showed that restricting the
postulate (7) only to sets of commuting operators leads to the same conclusion: the
impossibility of such hidden-variable theory [11]. Kochen and Specker obtained the
same result in the case of a spin one particle [12]. However, as latter recognised by
Bell, one can ﬁnd operators such that [ ˆA, ˆB] = 0 and [ ˆA, ˆC] = 0 but [ ˆB, ˆC]
= 0 which
can be measured with arbitrary accuracy with a given
means that both

3.3. Bell inequalities

Consider once more Bohm’s version of EPR experiment. The system is described
in quantum mechanics by the singlet state (1). The spins are sent away from each
other and are measured in two diﬀerent directions a and b at the same time, or
at least at times suﬃciently close to forbid any communication (at the speed of
light) between the two measurements. The outputs σa
2 = σb.b of
the measurements are multiplied and averaged over a large number of experiments,
leading to a correlation function C(a, b) =
. Quantum mechanics predicts
that this correlation function is equal to

1 = σ1.a and σb

(12)

(13)

Note that if the two spins are measured in the same direction a = b, the correlation
is simply CQM (a, a) =
1 which means that in all experiments, the two spins have
always been observed in opposite directions, reﬂecting the fact that the total spin
of the system is zero.

−

One is tempted to think in terms of classical vectors, but Bell showed that this
picture is incompatible with the average correlation (12) predicted by quantum
mechanics [13]. Indeed, in a local hidden-variable theory, the average correlation
reads

C(a, b) =

dλ ℘(λ)A(λ, a)B(λ, b),

Z
1 and B(λ, b) = V{|ψi,λ}(σb

where A(λ, a) = V{|ψi,λ}(σa

for any set of vectors a, b and c. In contradistinction, these inequalities are violated
by quantum mechanics as one can check by inserting the quantum correlation (12)
into (17). The experimental test of the Bell inequalities (see next section) allows
to decide unambiguously in favour of either quantum mechanics or local hidden-
variable classical theory. Note that we have restricted our attention to local theories
thus non-local hidden-variable theories may violate the Bell inequalities too.

3.4. A simple illustration of Bell’s inequalities

As a simple illustration, consider the following local hidden-variable theory. Spins
are unit vectors and the measurement of σ.a gives in a deterministic way the sign
of σ.a. Equivalently, the state of a spin can be associated with a point on the unit
sphere and the measurement of σ.a gives +1 if this point is in the hemisphere whose
revolution axis is along a and
1 otherwise (see leftmost illustration of the ﬁgure 2).
An entangled pair is supposed to be made of two spins in opposite directions so that
σ2 =
(σ1.a)(σ1.b) gives +1 if σ1 is
only in one of the two hemispheres whose revolutions axis are respectively along a
and b, and
1 otherwise. As can be seen in the central diagram of ﬁgure 2, the total
surface giving an output +1 is 4θ where θ is the angle between the two vectors a
σ2, the
and b. When assuming that the spins are produced in any direction σ1 =
average correlation is

4. Tests of Bell’s inequalities: from thought experiments to real-

istic experiments.

The conclusion of the above paragraph is that the Bell inequalities provide a
quantitative criterion to test the hidden-variable theories versus quantum mechan-
ics. Bell’s inequalities brought the discussion into the experimental domain. Many
experiments have since been performed, the outcomes of which are consistent with
quantum mechanics and inconsistent with local realism.

The ﬁrst step through experimental realization was performed in 1969 by Clauser,
Horne, Shimony and Holt [14]. They generalised the Bell theorem so as to apply to
actual experiments (CHSH inequalities). At the end of their paper, they proposed
an experiment based on the Bohm and Aharonov [15] version of the EPR paradox.
It is an optical variant aimed at measuring the polarisation correlation of a pair of
optical photons. This experiment was the ﬁrst of a long series in quantum optics.

The two main assumptions underlying the formalism leading to Bell’s theorem

are:

i) Existence of hidden variables which renders an account of the correlations. It is
a necessary hypothesis to obtain a conﬂict between the Bell inequalities and
quantum mechanics.

ii) Locality: the result of a measurement of the polarisation of one of the photons
does not depend on the orientation of the other analyser and vice-versa and the
way the pairs are emitted by the source does not depend on the measurement
setup. The locality assumption is thus crucial: Bell’s inequalities will no longer
hold without it.

Let us stress that determinism does not seem to be a necessary ingredient, since
it is possible to obtain analogous inequalities with local stochastic hidden-variable
theories [16,17]. Indeed, in 1969 Bell himself gave an example where the local hidden
variables do not determine completely the outcome of the measurements. One can
imagine for example that, for whatever reason, some local ﬂuctuations occur and
are responsible for the stochastic character of the measurement outcomes. However
such a theory is still in conﬂict with quantum mechanics.

4.1. Optical variant of the Bohm experiment

Figure 3 illustrates the optical variant [18] of the Bohm version [15] of the EPR
thought experiment. The source S produces pairs of photons with diﬀerent frequen-
cies ν1 and ν2, sent in opposite directions. Each photon encounters an analyser (a
polariser able to measure the linear polarisation) whose orientation can be set by the
experimentalist. The emerging signals are detected by photo-multipliers along two
perpendicular directions. A coincidence monitor measures the probabilities of single
or joint detections. The analyser I (respectively analyser II) is oriented along the a
(respectively b) direction. The result of the measurement of photon ν1 is A(a) = +1
if the polarisation is parallel to a and
1 if the polarisation is perpendicular to a.
The result of the measurement of photon ν2 is B(b) = +1 if the polarisation is

−

parallel to b and

1 if the polarisation is perpendicular to b.

The polarisation part of the state vector describing the pair is an entangled state:

However, in the 70’s, two-channel polarisers were not available and experiments
were performed with one channel polarisers. Such polarisers transmit light polarised
parallel to a (or b), but not the orthogonal counterpart so that only the N+(a),
N+(b) counting rates and the N++(a,b) coincidence rate are measured. The above
Bell inequalities have to be formulated again in order to depend only on these
measured quantities. Moreover, in realistic experiments only 10−5 of the emitted
photons are detected, so the quantities involved in S are not of the same order
of magnitude and there is no more possibility of violation of the generalised Bell
inequalities. In fact, one needs to consider only the pairs actually detected. To do
so, it is necessary to measure the rates when polarisers are removed. The ﬁnal version

4.3. First experiments in the 70’s.

Following the CHSH paper, a ﬁrst series of tests was performed in the 70’s using
polarisation-correlated visible photons. The entangled pair is produced by atomic
radiative cascades. A beam of atoms is emitted by an oven in a vacuum chamber
and submitted to an excitation. During the de-excitation process, two photons are
produced nearly simultaneously if the lifetime of the intermediate level is short
enough. For example, for the 0-1-0 calcium cascade (4p2 1S0
4s2 1S0)
a green and a violet photon are produced and the lifetime of the intermediate level
is very short, namely 5ns.

A ﬁrst experiment was performed by Clauser and Freedman in Berkeley in
1972 [19]. They use the 0-1-0 Ca cascade described above. The excited state was
obtained by ultraviolet radiation. In fact, additional spurious cascades occur and,
because of consequently weak signal, the experiment took 200 hours. A violation
of Bell’s inequalities by 5 standard deviations was observed. Experiments have also
been performed using a 1-1-0 cascade of mercury. The ﬁrst one was in disagreement
with quantum mechanics [20]. However, the experiment reproduced by another group
leads to a signiﬁcant violation of Bell’s inequalities [21]. This last experiment took
412 hours. Finally, in 1976, Fry and Thompson [22] produce entangled pairs with a
rate of several orders of magnitude larger. To obtain such a gain, they excited the
upper level selectively using a laser. The data was collected in 80 minutes and was
in excellent agreement with quantum mechanics, within 4 standard deviations.

Thus, at the end of the 70’s, the experiments were already in agreement with
quantum mechanics. However, they were performed with single channel polarisers
and one has to keep in mind that their use requires indirect reasoning, and auxiliary
calibrations.

4.4. Experiments of the Orsay group (1981-1982)

Thanks to progress in laser physics and modern optics, a second generation of
experiments was carried out by the Orsay group in the early 80’s. They developed
a high eﬃciency stable and well controlled source of entangled photons. Using the
same calcium cascade as Freedman et al, Aspect et al performed direct excitation
using two lasers, so that the atom radiative decay delivered only pairs of entangled
photons.

The ﬁrst experiment was performed using single channel polarisers [23], with an
improved analyser7 ensuring excellent rotational invariance and good transmission
coeﬃcients. Moreover, the main diﬀerence with previous experiments was that the

7Each analyser was a pile of plate polarisers.

excitation rate was more than ten times larger, allowing a large variety of tests to be
performed with a good statistical accuracy. Firstly they performed measurements
for the full 360◦ range of relative orientation of the polarisers. The experimental
value of S′ was found equal to 0.126
0.014 violating the Bell inequalities by 9 stan-
dard deviations and in excellent agreement with the value calculated from quan-
tum mechanics including the polarisers eﬃciencies and the lenses apertures angles,
0.005. Secondly, no change was observed in the results with polarisers at a
0.118
distance (6 m) larger than the coherence length of ν2 (1.5 m).

The second experiment of the Orsay group, using two-channel polarisers8 [24]
was the ﬁrst actual analog of a Stern-Gerlach ﬁlter for spin 1/2 particles. Five runs
were performed for each sensitive orientation of the polarisers. The average yielded
S = 2.697
±
0.05). This result leads to the greatest violation of generalised Bell inequalities ever
achieved (40 standard deviations!).

0.015 in very good agreement with quantum mechanics (SQM = 2.70

All the above experiments were static experiments: the locality condition – which
is crucial – is indirectly tested. In 1964, J.S Bell already noted that “the setting
of the instruments are made suﬃciently in advance to allow them to reach some
mutual rapport by exchange of signals with velocity less than or equal to that of
light”. Consequently, the important point was to perform an experiment in which
the settings are changed during the ﬂight of the particles. The locality condition
would then be compatible with Einstein causality preventing any faster-than-light
inﬂuence. Such a timing experiment was done by the Orsay group in 1982 [25].
During this third experiment, the setup was modiﬁed in order to switch the direction
of polarisation analysis after the photons left the source. To do so, the (single-
channel) polarisers were replaced by a switching device together with two polarisers
in two diﬀerent orientations, equivalent to a variable polariser switched between two
polarisations. The switchings are periodic, but the relative phases were randomly
chosen and uncorrelated. The distance between the switches was large enough (13
m) for the time of travel of a signal at the velocity of light (43 ns) to be signiﬁcantly
larger than the delay between two switchings (about 10 ns) and the delay between
the emission of the two photons (5ns average).

Because of a reduced signal (due to the limited aperture of the switches), a
15 hours averaging was necessary. The results are in good agreement with quantum
mechanics, violating the Bell inequalities by 5 standard deviations.

4.5. Toward the ideal experiment

After the above work of the Orsay group in the early 80’s, one could conclude that
all recent experiments conﬁrm the predictions of quantum mechanics and that no
additional test is required. However, from a strictly logical point of view, the above
experiments do not succeed in ruling out a local realistic explanation completely,
because of two essential loopholes: locality and detection.

8The polarisers were polarising cubes, made of two prisms with suitable dielectric thin ﬁlms on

their sides stuck together.

20

The locality loophole remains open in the third experiment by Aspect et al. [25]
due to the periodic sinusoidal switching used. Thus communication slower than the
speed of light, or even at the speed of light, could in principle explain the results
obtained. In fact, the condition of locality is fully enforced for the ﬁrst time only in
1998 by Weihs and co-worker [26] in Innsbr¨uck. In their experiment, the necessary
space-like separation of the observations is achieved by:

i) suﬃcient physical distance between the measurement stations (440m),

ii) ultra-fast and random setting of the analysers,

iii) completely independent data registration, the timing being monitored by local

rubidium atomic clocks.

This crucial experiment has become possible because of the development of new
sources of correlated photons [27]. In these sources, a pair of red photons is produced
by a parametric down conversion of a U.V. photon (pump beam) in a non-linear
crystal. Because of the phase matching condition (determined by the orientation
of the crystal axes relative to the pump beam), there is a strong correlation be-
tween the directions of emission of the two photons of a pair (in contrast with the
atomic radiative cascades which produce photons only weakly correlated in direc-
tion). Consequently, larger coincidence rates can be obtained (more than one order
of magnitude larger than in atomic radiative cascade). Moreover, the production of
two narrow beams of correlated photons permits one to feed them into two optical
ﬁbres. Then, from a practical point of view, with this new schemes:

i) it becomes possible to work with small integrated electro-optical devices,

ii) the detectors can be kilometres apart.

Weihs et al observed a violation of the CHSH inequality of 100 standard deviations!
These results close the locality loophole.

It is worth noting that the new parametric down conversion sources present
another interesting feature. They produce entangled states with correlation between
other observables than polarisation, namely time of emission, energy, direction of
emissions. Among the amount of experiments performed during the 15 last years, two
of them can be mentioned: they present an experimental demonstration of quantum
correlations over 4km [28] and 10km [29] using optical ﬁbres, concluding that the
distance does not destroy the entanglement.

The so-called “detection loophole” relies on the fact that all experiments so
far detected only a small subset of all pairs created [30]. It is therefore necessary
to assume that the pairs registered are a fair sample of all pairs emitted (“fair
sampling assumption”) as emphasised by J.S. Bell: “. . . it is hard for me to believe
that quantum mechanics works so nicely for ineﬃcient practical set-ups and is yet
going to fail badly when suﬃcient reﬁnements are made”. However, experiments have
been performed in order to try to close the detection loophole. Due to a too low
eﬃciency of currently available photon detectors, people also used massive particles

version of November 23, 2013

21

which are easier to detect. Conclusive tests of the Bell inequalities have been realised
by Rowe et al [31]. Two trapped ions are prepared in an entangled state by Raman
laser beams. The agreement with quantum mechanics is excellent, making their
experiment the ﬁrst violation of the Bell inequalities with high enough eﬃciency.
However one has to mention that the two ions in the same trap are very close to
each other, so that the detection events are not space-like separated and it seems
diﬃcult to fulﬁl the timing conditions in experiments following this scheme.

Entanglement experiments have also been performed with Rydberg atoms and
microwave photons in a cavity. However, the signal contrast in these experiments [32]
is not high enough to observe a violation of the Bell inequalities.

5. Neo-Bohmian interpretation

5.1. Orthodox interpretation, a few comments

In the physics community it is frequently stated that “it is not possible to know
simultaneously the position and the momentum of a given particle, since the position
and momentum operators are non-commutative”. This statement leads to a naive
realistic point of view concerning the use of operators in quantum mechanics, as
primary “real” objects and not as emerging quantities. Let us say, with Bohr, that
what we call “quantum observables” acquire their signiﬁcance only through their as-
sociation with speciﬁc experiments (measurements). In the Hilbert space parlance,
the relevant quantities associated with a given experiment are the partition of sub-
Hα and the values λα associated with the ﬁnal result of the experiment. The
spaces
is compactly represented by the self-adjoint operator
collection

{Hα, λα}

A =

λαPα ,

Xα

(29)

where Pα is the projector onto the corresponding Hilbert subspace
Hα. In this way a
given experiment ǫ is associated with a given operator Aǫ which ﬁnally is interpreted
as having a reality that is linked to the system alone and independent of the actual
reproducible experiment.

5.2. Bohmian interpretation

⊲ The goals of such an interpretation. The principal goal of the Bohmian inter-
pretation is clear – to restore realism. It is an attempt to give a clear ontology to the
constitutive elements of the world [34,?, 37]. On the most simple level of quantum
mechanics, we can state within this interpretation that the fundamental elements are
particles which are really particles and consequently they have a perfectly deﬁnite
position and velocity at all times. This does not mean that such an interpretation is
focused on the particle like structure of matter, since a ﬁeld ontology is also perfectly
possible. Once more, the goal is to give a clear ontology. Within the particle picture,
the lack of causality/determinism of quantum mechanics is of the same type as that
encountered in classical statistical mechanics, basically due to our lack of knowledge

of the initial conditions. But one should not confuse this approach with a return to
the classical Newtonian concepts.

⊲ de Broglie - Bohmian theory. In 1927, at the Solvay congress, the young French
physicist Louis de Broglie proposed a quantum theory known as the pilot-wave
theory [34]. His theory is grounded on two hypotheses:

i) there exists a continuous ﬁeld φ = ReiS/~ satisfying the Schr¨odinger equation

ii) the necessity that a particle, of mass m, follows the trajectories deﬁned by

This is basically the interpretation proposed some thirty years later by David Bohm [35].
The complete description within the pilot-wave interpretation of a system of N par-
ticles is speciﬁed by the wave function

From here, one can try to write a generalised Jacobi equation where, together
with the classical potential, a “quantum potential” appears, leading to a modiﬁ-
cation of Newtonian mechanics via a quantum force. This attempt however is not
really suitable since it does not emphasise the profound epistemological change from
Newtonian mechanics to quantum mechanics. Putting the wave function Ψ = ReiS/~
into the Schr¨odinger equation, the real and imaginary part lead to two equations.

tion proportional to the Planck constant [34,35]. The second equation is a continuity
equation,

This rewriting of the quantum equations suggests that the quantum nature of mat-
ter lies only on a slight modiﬁcation of the classical equations, basically by the
appearance of the quantum potential. This interpretation is tempting and was in-
deed adopted in the past. However the de Broglie-Bohm theory should actually be
considered as a new theory with its own corpus of concepts [38]. For example, the
particle masses are not the coeﬃcients appearing in Newton dynamical law but
rather the factors of the ﬁeld equation and entering into the guiding equations. On
the same lines, the velocities in the de Broglie-Bohm theory are not independent
of the positions since they are given by the guiding equations. What is fundamen-
tal here in this interpretation of the theory is the guidance condition and not the
quantum potential which can be viewed at best as a good picture when taking the
classical limit of the theory.

From the very beginning, the pilot-wave theory had to face several criticisms.
The ﬁrst is that there is no back reaction of the particles on the ﬁeld Ψ, which is
unusual in physics. Another criticism is that the ﬁeld itself, contrary to a physical
ﬁeld, doesn’t live in the physical space but rather in the much larger conﬁguration
space R3N . This leads to the non-local and non-separable character of the theory.
Finally, if one requires that this theory is consistent with the usual quantum theory
predictions, one should demand that the positions of the particles at the initial time
t0 should be distributed according to the law

and they will be distributed at a latter time as

ρ(q, t0) =

Ψ(q, t0)

ρ(q, t) =

Ψ(q, t)

One of the criticisms was that within this theory, the wave function plays at the same
time two apparently irreconcilable roles. It determines the quantum potential acting
on the particles and deﬁne a probability density associated with the trajectories.
Evidently, the most important point is to give a strong argument, possibly of the
same type as that given in classical statistical mechanics, leading to the quantum
distribution of the initial positions [36].

⊲ Probabilities. The important point in order to recover and save the usual quan-

2 and
in quantum equilibrium it is not possible to go beyond the distribution
consequently no deviation or violation of the Heisenberg inequalities will be ever
observed. In other words, the clear ontology introduced via, for example, the parti-
cle picture, will neither remove nor erase the “paradoxical” quantum behaviour of
the system, since it is in quantum equilibrium. The gain compared to the orthodox
interpretation is that now the indeterminism is empirical not ontological.

The remaining point is to address the following question. Why is the system of
interest in quantum equilibrium? From the very beginning of the de Broglie-Bohm
interpretation, this was the diﬃcult aspect to be clariﬁed. Several attempts were
made in several directions, modifying the original theory or trying to set up a dy-
namical foundation of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis. It is not clear if such an
attempt is accessible or feasible. However it could be as well that the equilibrium hy-
pothesis has to be postulated as an empirical fact. More recently, in another direction
of thought, D¨urr et al. proposed an explanation `a la Boltzmann [37]. The essential
point is the notion of a partial wave function associated with a subsystem of a much
larger system, exactly in analogy with the emergence of the canonical distribution
when considering a small part of an isolated total system, the total system being in
a “typical” state. Indeed, if one takes seriously enough the de Broglie-Bohm theory
one should expect that the behaviour of a subsystem is completely determined by
the wave function Ψ(q) of the universe and its corresponding conﬁguration. D¨urr et
al. associate a wave function with a subsystem within the following decomposition
of the universe wave function,

Ψ(x, y) = ψ(x)Φ(y) + Ψ⊥(x, y)

where x stands for the system variable while y is associated with the rest of the
universe. The functions Φ and Ψ⊥ have macroscopically distinct supports for the
variable y. So, if the conﬁguration variable Y lies into the Φ support, we have

(41)

(42)

Ψ(x, Y ) = ψ(x)Φ(Y ),

and one is able to associate a wave function with the subsystem. The preceding
structure of the total wave function is justiﬁed within the decoherence mechanism,
i.e. the irreversible ﬂow of the coherent phase into the so called environment, that
is the rest of the universe.

Since, as stated by Mach and others, the universe is given only once, it is mean-
ingless to associate with it a distribution ρ from its wave function Ψ. Nevertheless,
2 gives a measure of
D¨urr et al. argued on the base of “time independence” that
typicality and then, within a typical universe that is over an overwhelming majority
of possible initial universe conﬁgurations, the equilibrium hypothesis holds for the
subsystems[37]. Objections to this derivation were formulated since it is not clear at
all why dynamical considerations should play any role in order to specify the initial
conditions.

⊲ The wave function as a law. In their formulation of Bohmian mechanics, D¨urr et
al. proposed a very interesting interpretation of the wave function as a law governing
the dynamics rather than specifying the state of the system [38]. Indeed, if we
suppose that the function of the universe is given by a law of the form

the solution Ψ of this equation together with the initial conﬁguration Q determines
perfectly the future evolution of the positions, thanks to the guiding equation,

where D is a diﬀerential operator. We see here the analogy with, for example, Hamil-
ton’s equations

and one is tempted to identify the role of log Ψ with that of the Hamiltonian H. In
that sense, Ψ plays the role of the law governing the motion of the particles. This
interpretation has also the merit of providing an explanation of the “bizarre” fact
that the wave function lives in the conﬁguration space and not in the real space as
other physical ﬁelds.

Finally, within this picture, one may notice that the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation for a system should emerge from the universe equation HU Ψ when restrict-
ing to the system wave function ψ. In suﬃciently simple models such a reduction
was accomplished explicitly.

5.3. Criticism of the de Broglie-Bohm theory

Since the very beginning, what is usually called the de Broglie-Bohm theory
or the pilot-wave theory has received much criticism. These include the return to
classical concepts, the lack of new predictions compared to the standard quantum
mechanics, asymmetry with respect to position and momentum, the introduction of
myriads of empty waves, the foundation of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis, as
well as its relativistic and quantum ﬁeld generalisations. This list is certainly not
exhaustive but it is intended to be long enough to give to the reader the impression
of a not-so-well founded theory. However, most of the criticism could be answered
with convincing arguments and none of these objections are rigorous disproof of the
de Broglie-Bohm theory. One can refer to Passon [39] for a short reply to all these
objections.

6. Discussion

Realism is the assumption that there exists an objective external world indepen-
dent of our perception of it. In a realistic physical theory, one thus requires a clear

26

ontology of the basic “objects” used – for example ﬁelds which are really ﬁelds, par-
ticles which are really particles, etc. [37,38]. Locality means that these objects are
deﬁned locally with no instantaneous action at a distance. Local realism may thus
be deﬁned by the combination of the principle of locality with the assumption that
all objects must objectively have their properties already before they are observed.
The paradigmatic example is that of local hidden variables.

To summarise the experimental contribution to this debate, one can conclude
that, since the pioneering ones in the sixties, an impressive amount of studies are
in agreement with quantum mechanics, or at least contradict local hidden-variable
theories. Today, even in the absence of an ultimate experiment - where both the
detection loophole would be deﬁnitely closed and locality enforced - one can conclude
there is a failure of local realism. It would be interesting to improve the detection
[33].
process in such experiments, as recently proposed by Garcia-Patron et al
However we do not consider that the detection loophole is as crucial as the locality
one.

It is nevertheless important to underline that local hidden-variable theories have
been ruled out but that the hidden-variable theories in general have not been dis-
qualiﬁed. For example, the Bohmian mechanics or stochastic approaches are not
invalidated, since they are non-local theories. Although the neo-Bohmian inter-
pretation, oﬀers a promising alternative and gives an example of the possibility
of a deterministic interpretation with a clear ontology, it suﬀers from an essential
weakness. This is the overly-close relationship with the usual quantum mechanics,
since it was specially designed to restore the predictions made by ordinary quan-
tum mechanics. Consequently, neo-Bohmian and Quantum Mechanics are examples
of empirically equivalent theories and it is not clear whether one should expect a
signiﬁcant progress in the interpretation restricting only to empirically equivalent
theories. Stochastic approaches open a perspective, but suﬀer from the diﬃculty of
admiting a generalisation in a relativistic context.

Eventually we can summarise the basic lines of the orthodox interpretation as
being within the essential probabilism, forbidding the possibility of an ontological
determinism, and the complementarity principle, stating that it is only possible
within one experiment to reach partial aspects of reality which are excluded mutu-
ally. Consistently with this approach, one may comment that the perfect knowledge
of the state of the system leads in general, nevertheless, to probabilistic aspects, that
is to intrinsic stochasticity. The truth is not elsewhere, deeper, but on the surface.
In some sense, we recover again the idea of an achievement of science, an old idea
that seems to accompany the new theories frequently. It is amazing to notice that
so much eﬀorts of research and pedagogical type have been done into the direction
of impossibility theorems by those who themselves have discovered and built the
theory. In other areas of human activity this would be suspicious, in physics it is
not.

(Ara Apkarian): Could you comment on the conceptual distinction between
locality and separability.

One may deﬁne separability in the following way: a separable state is one that
can be created from another state by local means, which is not true for an
entangled state. Mathematically, one expresses that in the form

ρ =

Xk

pkρk

A ⊗

ρk
B ,

pk = 1

Xk

where ρ is the density matrix of the quantum state and where ρA,B are density
matrices belonging to the Hilbert spaces
HA,B. It seems then that locality
plays a signiﬁcant role in the concept of separability. However, if one takes
as a deﬁnition for locality the fact that distant objects cannot inﬂuence each
other directly, one implicitly refers to objects, meaning real objects. But, in the
so called orthodox interpretation, the wave function have no direct physical
interpretation or reality, meaning that it is the concept of local object that is
rejected in general. In a non separable state, one cannot a priori deﬁne local
real objects.

(Eduardo Lude˜na): Could you comment on the eﬀect of distance on entangle-
ment.

What is important, rather than distance, is the interaction with environment.
As long as this interaction remains negligible, the entangled character of a
quantum state is preserved.

(Bertrand Berche): This is a personal comment more than a question. I believe
that physicits’ common conception of a physical theory is very constraining.
Could’nt we imagine as admissible a theory which would not be able at all to
answer (I mean even not in probabilistic terms) some questions which are a
priori from its domain of applicability? Something a bit like G¨odel’s theorem
and propositions which are neither true nor false. Why do we ask so much to
our theories? Isn’t it due to our custom that physical theories have been so
powerful in the past, with the ”The Unreasonable Eﬀectiveness of Mathematics
in the Natural Sciences” of Eugene Wigner.

(Yurij Holovatch): Is the Bohm theory the only known non-local hidden-
variable theory?

No, an alternative theory called stochastic mechanics was also pretty much
studied. In 1966, Nelson showed that the Schr¨odinger equation could be derived

30

from the hydrodynamical equation of a classical ﬂuid made of particles with
Brownian trajectories (E. Nelson, Phys. Rev. 150, p. 1079 (1966), Derivation
of the Schroedinger Equation from Newtonian Mechanics ). He suggested that
the interaction of the particles with the vacuum for instance could induce
ﬂuctuations of their position. Because of these ﬂuctuations, the trajectories
are continuous but not diﬀerentiable. At a given time, two diﬀerent velocities
can be deﬁned: the advanced and the retarded velocities related to each other
by reversing the direction of time:

b(t) = lim
∆t→0+

h

r(t + ∆t)

where
denotes the average over the ﬂuctuations. At the macroscopic level,
the density of particles satisﬁes a diﬀusion equation with a diﬀusion constant
depending on the Planck constant. By reversing the direction of time, the sign
of this diﬀusion constant changes. Nelson combined these two equations to get
a Navier-Stockes-like hydrodynamical equation

The stochastic mechanics still suﬀers from several problems. First of all, the
interpretation of the theory is not trivial even though some progresses have
been made by Fritsche and Haugk in 2003 (L. Fritsche et M. Haugk, Ann. Phys.
(Leipzig) 12, p. 371 (2003), A new look at the derivation of the Schrodinger
equation from Newtonian mechanics ). Moreover, there is still no relativistic
generalization of the Nelson approach.

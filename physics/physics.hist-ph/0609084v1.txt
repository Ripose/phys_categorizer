Abstract

It is noted that a given pairing of the phase factor and gauge transformation to retain gauge
symmetry is not unique. In their seminal paper, when Yang and Mills (YM) discuss the phase
factor - gauge transformation relationship, they cite Pauli’s review paper. It is interesting that
although Pauli in that paper presents the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength in terms of a commutator,
for whatever reason YM did not extrapolate the commutator’s use to obtain the Yang-Mills ﬁeld
strength – they obtained it by trial and error. Presented is a derivation of this ﬁeld strength using
the commutator approach detailing how certain terms cancel each other. Finally, the Yang-Mills
ﬁeld transformation is derived in a slightly diﬀerent way than is traditionally done.

This is an addendum to the article on diﬀerential geometry and Feynman diagrams that appeared in the
Notices of the American Mathematical Society (Marateck 2006). It expands on some of the topics covered
in the original article.

Introduction

2 Gauge theory

Weyl introduced as a phase factor (Weyl 1929) an exponential in which the phase α is preceded by the
imaginary unit i, e.g., e+iqα(x), in the wave function for the wave equations (for instance, the Dirac equation
is (iγµ∂µ − m)ψ = 0). It is here that Weyl correctly formulated gauge theory as a symmetry principle from
which electromagnetism could be derived. It had been shown that for a quantum theory of charged particles
interacting with the electromagnetic ﬁeld, invariance under a gauge transformation of the potentials required
multiplication of the wave function by the now well-know phase factor. Yang cites (Yang 1986) Weyl’s gauge
theory results as reported (Pauli 1941) by Pauli as a source for Yang-Mills gauge theory; although Yang
didn’t ﬁnd out until much later that these were Weyl’s results. Moreover, Pauli’s article did not mention
Weyl’s geometric interpretation. It was only much after Yang and Mills published their article that Yang
realized the connection between their work and geometry. In fact, in his selected papers (Yang, 2005), Yang
says

What Mills and I were doing in 1954 was generalizing Maxwell’s theory. We knew of no geomet-
rical meaning of Maxwell’s theory, and we were not looking in that direction.

For the wave equations to be gauge invariant, i.e., have the same form after the gauge transformation
as before, the local phase transformation ψ(x) → ψ(x)e+iα(x) has to be accompanied by the local gauge
transformation

Aµ → Aµ − q−1∂µα(x)

(1)

This dictates that the ∂µ in the wave equations be replaced by the covariant derivative ∂µ + iqAµ in order
for the ∂µα(x) terms to cancel each other. This pair of phase factor- gauge transformation is not unique.
Another pair that retains gauge symmetry and results in the same covariant derivative has the q included
in the phase factor, i.e., ψ(x) → ψ(x)e+iqα(x) paired with

The fact that this pairing is not unique is not surprising since the phase factor and gauge transformation
have no physical signiﬁcance.

Aµ → Aµ − ∂µα( x)

3 Yang-Mills ﬁeld strength

Pauli, in equation (22a) of Part I of his 1941 review article (Pauli 1941) gives the electromagnetic ﬁeld
strength in terms of a commutator. In present-day usage it is

where Dµ is the covariant derivative ∂µ+iǫAµ. Mathematically, equation [3] corresponds to the curvature (the
ﬁeld strength) reﬂecting the eﬀect of parallel transport of a vector around a closed path, i.e., its holonomic
behavior. If the ﬁeld strength is zero, the vector will return to its point of origin pointing in its original
direction. In their seminal paper (Yang 1954) Yang and Mills do not mention this relation, although they
do cite Pauli’s 1941 article. They use

[Dµ, Dν] = iǫFµν

ψ = Sψ′

where S is a local isotopic spin rotation represented by an SU(2) matrix, to obtain the gauge transformation
in equation [3] of their paper

They∗ then deﬁne the ﬁeld strength as

B′

µ = S−1BµS + iS−1(∂µS)/ǫ

Fµν = (∂ν Bµ − ∂µBν) + iǫ(BµBν − Bν Bµ)

This corresponds to Cartan’s second structural equation which in diﬀerential geometry notation is Ω = dA + [A, A],
where A is a connection on a principal ﬁber bundle.

They introduce equation (6) (their equation [4]) by saying

In analogy to the procedure of obtaining gauge invariant ﬁeld strengths in the electromagnetic
case, we deﬁne (4) Fµν = (∂ν Bµ − ∂µBν) + iǫ(BµBν − Bν Bµ) One easily shows from [B′
µ =
S−1BµS + iS−1(∂µS)/ǫ] that (5) F ′
µν = S−1Fµν S under an isotopic gauge transformation. Other
simple functions of B than (4) do not lead to such a simple transformation property.

∗Yang had earlier started studying this problem as a graduate student at the University of Chicago and derived equation
(5). When he returned to this problem as a visitor at Brookhaven, he in collaboration with Mills obtained (as we will explain)
the ﬁeld strength.

Yang and Mills arrived at the ﬁeld strength, equation (6), by trial and error. They added terms to the
electromagnetic part until they found the commutator part, all the while plugging the resulting ﬁeld strength
into their equation [5] for veriﬁcation.

Using the Yang-Mills covariant derivative (∂µ − iǫBµ) let’s see how the Yang-Mills ﬁeld strength is

obtained from the commutator

[Dµ, Dν] = (∂µ − iǫBµ)(∂ν − iǫBν)−

(∂ν − iǫBν)(∂µ − iǫBµ)

operating on the wave function ψ. Note that −∂µ(Bνψ) = −(∂µBν)ψ − Bν∂µψ and ∂ν(Bµψ) = (∂ν Bµ)ψ +
Bµ∂ν ψ. So we get a needed −Bν∂µ and a Bµ∂ν term to cancel Bν ∂µ and −Bµ∂ν respectively. Thus
expanding (7) we get

∂µ∂ν − iǫ∂µBν − iǫBµ∂ν − iǫBν∂µ − ǫ2BµBν − ∂ν∂µ

+ iǫ∂νBµ + iǫBν∂µ + iǫBµ∂ν + ǫ2Bν Bµ

which reduces to iǫ(∂νBµ − ∂µBν ) − ǫ2[Bµ, Bν] or [Dµ, Dν] = iǫFµν

4 The ﬁeld transformation

We present a pedagogical derivation of the gauge transformation by using the transformation

instead of the traditional ψ = Sψ′, i.e., the one Yang and Mills used. In order to obtain the gauge transfor-
mation in equation [3] of the Yang and Mills paper

B′

µ = S−1BµS + iS−1(∂µS)/ǫ

requires you to use† ∂µS−1 = −S−1(∂µS)S−1. Thus, the approach indicated by equation (9) is marginally
more straight-forward since it doesn’t require diﬀerentiating the inverse of a matrix.
The covariant derivative, Dµ = ∂µ − iǫBµ, transforms the same way as ψ does

.

or

The left-hand side of equation (11) becomes

But (12) equals S∂µψ − iǫSBµψ. Cancelling S∂µψ on both sides we get,

(∂µ − iǫB′

µ)Sψ = (∂µS)ψ + S∂µψ − iǫB′

µSψ

(∂µS)ψ − iǫB′

µSψ = −iǫSBµψ

†The following can be obtained by diﬀerentiating S−1S = I

thus

We will use S = eiα(x)·σ. So for α inﬁntessimal, S = 1 + iα · σ which produces

B′

µS = SBµ + (∂µS)/(iǫ)

B′

µ = SBµS−1 − i(∂µS)S−1/ǫ

B′

µ = (1 + iα · σ)Bµ(1 − iα · σ)

− i(1/ǫ)∂µ(1 + iα · σ)(1 − iα · σ)

Remembering that (a · σ)(b · σ) = a · b + iσ · (a × b), setting Bµ = σ · bµ, and since α is inﬁntessimal, dropping
terms of order α2, we get

and ﬁnally

which (because our S is the inverse of Yang-Mills’ S) is equation [10] in the Yang-Mills paper.

Abstract

We give an account of the appearance and ﬁrst developments of the statistical model
of atoms proposed by Thomas and Fermi, focusing on the main results achieved by
Fermi and his group in Rome. Particular attention is addressed to the unknown con-
tribution to this subject by Majorana, anticipating some important results reached
later by leading physicists.

1 Introduction

In the occasion of the centennial of the death of A. Volta, an important international
conference was held in Como (Italy) on September 1927, mainly devoted to the principles
and applications of the new Quantum Mechanics. Among the interesting contributions
by Bohr, Heisenberg, Pauli and others, it stands out the long speech by Fermi aimed to
point out the diﬀerent behavior of the particles satisfying the Bose-Einstein statistics and
those obeying the Pauli exclusion principle, such as electrons. Fermi started to investigate
in this direction since 1923 [1], [2], when he published his “remarks on the quantization
of systems with identical particles”, where anticipated the formulation of the exclusion
principle for generic molecules given by Pauli one year later. Soon after the appearance of
the Pauli paper, Fermi recognized to have all the tools in order to build a theory of perfect
gases satisfying the Nernst principle at zero temperature, and on the 7th February, 1926 he
presented the statistical distribution law for particles obeying the exclusion principle [3].
Such a law will be independently discovered later by Dirac in the August of the same year.
The most distinguished physicists of that epoch reached immediately the importance of
the Fermi work, and in the February of 1927 Pauli applied it to the conduction electrons
in a metal, explaining their anomalous paramagnetism. Later on, at the Como conference,
Sommerfeld reported on his recent works on thermal and transport properties in metals
and succeeded in explaining, for the ﬁrst time, the electron contribution to the speciﬁc
heat of a metal. Probably encouraged by the successful application to speciﬁc heat and
entropy calculations, in the fall of 1927, just after the Como conference, Fermi matured
the idea of applying his statistical method to the completely degenerate state of the
electrons in an atom, in order to evaluate the eﬀective potential acting on the electrons
themselves. He was aware of the fact that, since the number of the electrons involved is
usually only moderately large, the results obtained will not present a very high accuracy.
Nevertheless, the method resulted to be very simple, and gave an easy-to-use expression
for the screening of the Coulomb potential accounted for by electrons as a whole.

Then Fermi started to apply his method to several problems of atomic physics, and
some more were suggested at that time to Rasetti and other associates of his group in
Rome. The basic idea of the statistical method of atoms became one of his preferred
ones, and practically the main activity of the Fermi group at the Physics Institute in
Rome from 1928 to 1932 was devoted to this subject.

2 The Thomas-Fermi model

2.1 The case of neutral atoms

The main idea of the statistical model of atoms is that of considering the electrons around
the atomic nucleus as a gas of particles, obeying the Pauli exclusion principle, at the ab-
solute zero of temperature. The limiting case of the Fermi statistics for strong degeneracy
applies to such a gas. Then, the maximum electron kinetic energy (in a neutral atom),

can be identiﬁed with that of a uniform gas of electrons whose number density is given
by:

Note that the total energy has to be constant at any spatial point since, otherwise, a ﬂux
eV
of electrons from one point to another would be established. The potential energy
en at that point:
depends, thus, on the position through the electron charge density ρ =

This was realized by Thomas in 1926 [4] and, independently, by Fermi in the December
of 1927 [5]. Fermi and many other relevant physicists1 were unaware that essentially
identical conclusions had previously been reached by Thomas, since the English researcher
published his results on a journal which was probably not widespread through the physics
community. According to Rasetti [6], “Fermi became acquainted with Thomas’ paper
only late in 1928, when it was pointed out to him by one (now unidentiﬁed) of the
foreign theoreticians visiting Rome”. It is also intriguing to note that for some time the
statistical model was denoted as the Fermi-Thomas model rather then as the Thomas-
Fermi one (compare, for example the papers in Refs [7],[8] appeared in 1930 with that
of Sommerfeld in [9] of 1932). We further observe that Thomas made use of only the
exclusion principle (in writing Eq. (2), while Fermi considered also the dependence of the
eﬀective potential (entering in Eq. (3)) on the temperature of the gas. Such a diﬀerence,
however, is not very signiﬁcative since the number density of electrons in the occupied
states of an atom reaches high values due to the small space region where they are placed.
Then, the electrons form a completely degenerate gas, and the correction to the eﬀective
potential reduces to a small term proportional to the temperature T , which does not alter
the main results of the model in the limit T

→
The eﬀective electrostatic potential is related to the electron charge density by means

of the Poisson equation,

and substituting in this the expression in Eq. (3), Thomas and Fermi found a second-order
inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation for V with a term proportional to V 3/2:

In order to simplify the diﬀerential equation in Eq. (5), Fermi introduced a suitable

change of variables:

with

In terms of the new variables, Eq. (5) becomes (for ϕ > 0):

(a prime denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to x) with the boundary conditions:

The Fermi equation (11) is a universal equation which does not depend neither on Z
nor on physical constants (¯h, m, e). Its solution gives, from Eq. (9), as noted by Fermi
himself, a screened Coulomb potential which at any point is equal to that produced by
an eﬀective charge

As was immediately realized, in force of the independence of Eq. (11) on Z, the method
gives an eﬀective potential which can be easily adapted to describe any atom with a
suitable scaling factor, according to Eq. (13).

2.2 The case of positive ions

In order to evaluate ionization energies and similar quantities which are relevant for
Atomic Physics observations, Fermi and Rasetti [6], [10], [11] proceeded to apply and
enlarge the above method to describe positive ions. They considered the ion of nuclear
charge Ze as a neutral atom of nuclear charge (Z
1)e, to be treated with the statistical
method, plus an extra proton in the nucleus.

With this formula, Fermi and his associates in Rome extended their calculations to many
physical problems, obtaining quantities which well ﬁtted the observations and the knowl-
edge of the time.

The method was further generalized for arbitrary positively charged ions by Baker
in June 1930 [7] and corrected (for an interpretational misunderstanding) by Guth and
Peierls six months later [8].

3 Solution of an equation

3.1 Numerical works

The problem of the theoretical calculation of observable atomic properties is solved, in
the statistical model approximation, in terms of the function ϕ(x) introduced in Eq. (9)
and satisfying the Fermi diﬀerential equation (11). However, it was believed that the
solution of such equation satisfying the appropriate boundary conditions in (12) couldn’t
be expressed in closed form, so that some eﬀort was made by Thomas [4], Fermi [5], [11]
and others [7] in order to achieve numerical integration of the diﬀerential equation.

Thomas used a numerical method described by Whittaker and Robinson [12] in order
to solve the second-order diﬀerential equation for the electrostatic potential V . He thus
obtained a numerical table for some mathematical quantities from which one can deduce
the values of V as function of the distance r from the nucleus. However, as already
observed by Baker [7], Thomas’ numerical calculations of V near r = 0 are “slightly in
error”, and this inﬂuenced also some calculations by Milne [13] who directly applied the
Thomas theory as early as in 1927.

A similar eﬀort was also pursued by Fermi who built a numerical table for the values of
the function ϕ(x) obeying Eq. (11). The numerical work was performed in approximately
one week and, according to many testimonies [6], [14] (see the anecdote related to Majo-
rana), the table was ready as early as at the end of 1927, although it was published only
in the German paper of 1928 [11]. The numerical values obtained by Fermi were largely
used not only by the members of the Rome group, but even by many other physicists who
dealt with atomic problems (see, for example, Refs. [7],[15]).

3.2 Approximate solutions in two limiting cases

By using standard but involved mathematical tools, in his paper [4] Thomas got an exact,
“singular” solution of his diﬀerential equation satisfying only the condition (7). This was
later (in 1930) considered by Sommerfeld [15] as an approximation of the function ϕ(x)
for large x (and is indeed known as the “Sommerfeld solution” of the Fermi equation),

ϕ(x) =

144
x3 ,

4

(16)

and Sommerfeld himself obtained corrections to the above quantity in order to approxi-
mate in a better way the function ϕ(x) for not extremely large values of x. The goodness
of the approximated expression was checked by Sommerfeld comparing his results with
the numerical values obtained by Fermi [15].

It is intriguing to observe that the solution in Eq. (16) was already known to Majorana
[19] at the end of 1927 (independently from Thomas), who recognized its crucial role in
determining the desired solution of Eq.
(12) (see
below).

(11) with boundary conditions Eq.

An approximate solution for ϕ(x) near x = 0 was, instead, ﬁrst considered by Fermi
[5], who obtained a series expansion for it. The reasoning is, probably, as follows. For x
near 0 we have ϕ(x)

1, so that substitution into Eq. (11) results in

∼

ϕ′′(x) = x−1/2.

(17)

By integrating this approximate equation we easily have

for x near the origin. The constant k1 is obtained directly from the ﬁrst condition in (12),
while k2 was determined by Fermi to assume the numerical value
1, 58 for the neutral
atom. Thus, the Fermi approximation for x

0 results to be:

According to Rasetti [6], Segr`e [16] and Amaldi [14], the paper in Ref. [5] was shown to
Majorana probably even before its publication. Majorana then proceeded to improve the
degree of approximation of the Fermi formula (19), and considered several other terms in
the series expansion up to the sixth power of x (including both integer and half-integer
powers)2. The method followed by him is a generalization of the Frobenius method for
diﬀerential equations [18]; its sketch is as follows.

Let us consider a solution of Eq. (11), which can be rewritten as

(21) with integer powers of x account for the usual Taylor series
The terms in Eq.
expansion, while those with half-integer powers attain to the Frobenius one. The need for
both terms is dictated by the Fermi approximation underlying Eqs. (17)-(19). The yet
unknown coeﬃcients a2n and a2n−1 are then determined by substituting Eq. (21) into Eq.
(20) and requiring that the coeﬃcients of given powers of x, appearing in the L.H.S. of
Eq. (20), vanish. In such a way, one is able to obtain two iterative formulae for a2n and
a2n−1 coeﬃcients. However, diﬀerently from what is usually found in the notebooks by
2Majorana never published his results on the Thomas-Fermi equation. What we discuss here and in
the next section is entirely deduced from the unpublished notes kept at the Domus Galilaeana in Pisa
(Italy) and known, in Italian, as “Fogli sparsi” and “Volumetti” [17].

Majorana (see [17]), he did not succeed to obtain general expressions for the coeﬃcients,
but he stopped the series to the term x6 (thus considering a polynomial) and evaluated
only some coeﬃcients. The corresponding expression looks like as follow:

with p = 1.58, according to the Fermi value. Probably, Majorana abandoned the complete
series expansion in (21) because he realized that such a series does not converge to the
desired solution. Note, in fact, that the diﬀerential equation (11) or (20) is a non-linear
equation, so that the series solution method cannot, in general, be applied at all. It is
however remarkable that, stopping the series in (21) to any power n

Majorana) onward the corresponding polynomial diverges towards

but we point out that the ﬁrst one, ϕ(x
, is physically not acceptable

(see, for example, the discussion in Ref.
[8]). Eventually, we point out that the Fermi
approximation of the function ϕ(x) near x = 0 with a polynomial was later reconsidered
by Baker [7], who obtained terms up to the power x9/2. However, the coeﬃcient of the
last term presented by author is wrong (compare with the correct Majorana result in
Eq. (22)). We have dwell on this point in order to remark the complexity of calculations,
leading to the expressions for the coeﬃcients in the polynomial expansion, due to the non-
linearity of the equation considered. For example, in order to evaluate the coeﬃcients ai
in Eq. (21) up to the term x9/2, we have to solve a set of 10 coupled algebraic equations.
Note also that, due to the structure of the diﬀerential equation in (20), for obtaining the
correct expressions for the coeﬃcients, we have to start with a polynomial in (21) with
terms up to x15/2, rather than x9/2.

3.3 Exact and semi-analytical results

The work described above on the polynomial approximation, performed by Majorana,
was only the ﬁrst step towards an exact or semi-analytical solution to the Fermi equation.
We will indulge here on an anecdote reported by Rasetti [6], Segr`e [16] and Amaldi [14].
According to the last author, “Fermi gave a broad outline of the model and showed some
reprints of his recent works on the subject to Majorana, in particular the table showing
the numerical values of the so-called Fermi universal potential. Majorana listened with
interest and, after having asked for some explanations, left without giving any indication
of his thoughts or intentions. The next day, towards the end of the morning, he again
came into Fermi’s oﬃce and asked him without more ado to draw him the table which
he had seen for few moments the day before. Holding this table in his hand, he took
from his pocket a piece of paper on which he had worked out a similar table at home
in the last twenty-four hours, transforming, as far as Segr`e remembers, the second-order
Thomas-Fermi non-linear diﬀerential equation into a Riccati equation, which he had then
integrated numerically.”

The whole work performed by Majorana on the solution of the Fermi equation, is
contained in some spare sheets conserved at the Domus Galilaeana in Pisa, and diligently

reported by the author himself in his notebooks [17]. The reduction of the Fermi equation
to an Abel equation (rather than a Riccati one, as confused by Segr`e) proceeds as follows.
Let’s adopt a change of variables, from (x, ϕ) to (t, u), where the formula relating the two
sets of variables has to be determined in order to satisfy, if possible, both the boundary
conditions (12). The function ϕ in Eq. (16) has the correct behavior for large x, but
the wrong one near x = 0, so that we could modify the functional form of ϕ to take into
account the ﬁrst condition in (12). An obvious modiﬁcation is ϕ = (144/x3)f (x), with
0 in order to account for ϕ(x = 0) =
f (x) a suitable function which vanishes for x
1. The simplest choice for f (x) is a polynomial in the novel variable t, as it was also
considered later, in a similar way, by Sommerfeld [15]. The Majorana choice is as follows:

→

→

1 as x

0 3. From Eq. (23) we can then obtain the ﬁrst relation linking t to
with t
x, ϕ. The second one, involving the dependent variable u, is that typical of homogeneous
diﬀerential equations (like the Fermi equation) for reducing the order of the equation, i.e.
exponentiation with an integral of u(t). The transformation relations are thus:

→

(23)

(24)

1 u(t)dt .
3The explanation given here of the method pursued by Majorana has been inferred from the unpub-
lished papers left by the author. However, diﬀerently from the vast majority of arguments treated by
Majorana in his notebooks, no clear explanation of what the author does is explicitly reported.

Note that both the boundary conditions in (12) are automatically veriﬁed by the relations
(24). We have reported the derivation of the Abel equation (25) mainly for historical
reasons (see also the next section); the precise numerical values for the Fermi function
ϕ(x) were obtained by Majorana by solving a diﬀerent ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation [19].
It is also remarkable that none of the Majorana’s colleagues and friends was aware of this,
which however is well documented in the notebooks [17] and in some other unpublished
papers. Instead of Eq. (23), Majorana chooses ϕ(x) of the form

Now the point with x = 0 corresponds to t = 0. In order to obtain again a ﬁrst order
diﬀerential equation for u(t), the transformation equation for the variable u involves ϕ
and its ﬁrst derivative. Majorana then introduced the following formulas:

ϕ(x) =

144
x3 t6.

t = 144−1/6 x1/2 ϕ1/6,

Now the quantity ˙xϕ1/3 can be expressed in terms of t and u by making use again of the

The obtained equation is again non-linear but, diﬀerently from the original Fermi equation
(11), it is ﬁrst-order in the novel variable t and the degree of non-linearity is lower than
that of Eq. (11). The boundary conditions for u(t) are easily taken into account from the
second equation in (28) and by requiring that for x

Substitution of Eq. (33) (with the conditions in Eq. (32)) into Eq. (31) results into an

[19]). It is remarkable that
the series expansion in Eq. (33) is uniformly convergent in the interval [0, 1] for τ , since

Given the function u(t), we now have to look for the Thomas-Fermi function ϕ(x).
This was obtained in a parametric form x = x(t), ϕ = ϕ(t) in terms of the parameter t

Here w(t) is an auxiliary function which is determined in terms of u(t) by substituting
Eq. (35) into Eq. (28). As a result, the parametric solution of Eq. (11), with boundary
conditions (12), takes the form:

Remarkably, the Majorana solution of the Thomas-Fermi equation is obtained with only
one quadrature and gives easily obtainable numerical values for the electrostatic potential
inside atoms. By taking into account only 10 terms in the series expansion for u(t),
such numerical values approximate the values of the exact solution of the Thomas-Fermi
equation with a relative error of the order of 0.1% [19].

3.4 Numerical tables

It is instructive to give a look at the numerical results for the Thomas-Fermi function
ϕ(x) obtained by several authors with diﬀerent methods. As already pointed out, Thomas
ﬁrstly reported numerical values for the potential inside atoms. Since his approach in-
volved a diﬀerential equation equivalent to the Fermi equation but with a diﬀerent mathe-
matical structure (see [4]), which does not make direct use of the universal function ϕ(x),
the comparison between the Thomas numerical results and those obtained by Fermi and
others will not be considered here.

It is a matter of fact that many atomic physicists in the ′30s used the Fermi table in
their computations. As early as at the end of 1927, according to Segr`e [16] and Rasetti
[6], Fermi obtained the values of the function ϕ(x) by means of successive approximation
in Eq. (11), during approximatively one week of numerical work, by using a small hand
calculator (a Brunsviga one). The table, however, was published later in a German paper
[11]; we reproduce in Table 1 some of these results.4 As pointed out above, Majorana
checked the Fermi results by using probably the parametric solution in Eqs. (36). Note
that only the integration in Eq. (37) requires numerical evaluation. The results obtained
by Majorana, during approximatively one night of numerical work, are reported in his
“Volumetti” [17] and are reproduced here in Table 1.

A rapid look at this table shows a satisfactory agreement between the Fermi numerical
approach and the Majorana method. It is even remarkable that, for the ﬁrst points, Majo-
rana obtained also the values for the derivative of the function ϕ(x) (see [17]). Subsequent
more accurate numerical evaluations of the solution of the Thomas-Fermi equation were
4In Table 1 we report only the results obtained by Fermi, Majorana and Miranda corresponding to

common values of x considered by all three authors.

performed by Miranda in 1934 [20], who also gave a solid mathematical framework to
the numerical integration of the Fermi equation (see the next section). By using reﬁned
approximation procedures to a ﬁnite variation equation corresponding to the Fermi diﬀer-
ential equation, he obtained numerical values for ϕ(x) (and ϕ′(x)) which are accurate up
to the ﬁfth signiﬁcant digit for small x (Fermi and Majorana results are accurate “only”
up to the third signiﬁcant digit in the same x interval). Some results (corresponding to an

initial slope of
agreement between the results given by the three authors, which used completely diﬀerent
techniques, can be clearly deduced.

3.5 Mathematical properties

The non-linear second-order diﬀerential equation (11) has received much attention by
physicist from its discovery until now, mainly due to the important physical model un-
derlying it, which is not limited to atoms [21]. On the mathematical side, some formal
properties of the solutions of the Thomas-Fermi equation have been studied as well. We
will give here a brief account of the results achieved in the literature, excluding from
our discussion those corresponding to asymptotic expressions and theorems on numerical
approximations, which have been already considered above.

From the mathematical point of view, the starting most important result for a non-
linear diﬀerential equation is the theorem establishing the existence and uniqueness of
its solutions. For the case considered here, we point out that the physically interesting
solutions of Eq. (11) are those satisfying the boundary conditions (12) (or similar ones
for electrically charged ions).

11

The studies performed by Majorana and described above, especially those aimed to
transform the Thomas-Fermi equation into an Abel equation, seem to leave little space to
speculations in this direction. In fact, the theorem of existence and uniqueness for ϕ(x)
directly follows from that holding for the Abel equation (25), allowing the integrability of
its solution u(t) which is required in Eqs. (24).

However, the Majorana work on the Thomas-Fermi equation was practically unknown
to everybody (until recent times [17], [19]), and some other subsequent papers are usually
quoted in the literature. The theorem of existence and uniqueness for Eq.
(11) with
conditions (12) was clearly stated in 1929 by two Italian mathematicians, Mambriani [22]
and Scorza-Dragoni [23]. Looking at the analytical properties of the function appearing
in the R.H.S. of Eq. (11) and using standard methods holding for ordinary diﬀerential
equations, they showed that an inﬁnite number of integral curves of Eq. (11) pass through
ϕ plane, only one of which ϕ∗(x) being
a given point (x0, ϕ0) of the ﬁrst quadrant of the x
always decreasing and approaching the x-axis. This solution corresponds to a “critical”
value of the initial slope ϕ′
1.588. The other solutions with an initial slope
greater than the critical value lie above ϕ∗(x) and diverge for diverging x, while those with
an initial slope lower than the critical value lie below ϕ∗(x) and monotonically decrease
for increasing x as far as they reach the x

axis.
Mambriani and Scorza-Dragoni also gave a generalization of the theorem above ap-
plicable to a given class of diﬀerential equations [22], [23]. It is also interesting to point
out how several mathematicians participated in the debate originated by the discussion
of the Thomas-Fermi diﬀerential equation, including Caccioppoli as quoted in [23].

Some other mathematical questions underlying the statistical model introduced by
Thomas and Fermi and the solutions of the corresponding equation were then tackled only
later in the 1940’s [24]. In particular the attention drifted towards variational methods
applied to a “Thomas-Fermi energy functional”, involving the screened potential ϕ(x), in
order to obtain the ground state energy for the relevant atoms (and molecules). A renewed
interest started in 1969 with the paper by Hille [25], who studied analytically a number of
mathematical aspects of the Thomas-Fermi equation for the atomic case. Generalization
to the molecular case was subsequently analyzed by Lieb and Simon in 1977 [26], proving
the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding Thomas-Fermi function.

We address the interested reader to the quoted literature for the details on this subject,

which is beyond the aims of the present paper.

4 First applications of the statistical method

The ﬁrst practical applications of the Thomas-Fermi model of atoms were developed by
Fermi himself and his collaborators in Rome (mainly Rasetti [27], Gentile and Majorana
[28]). According to Rasetti [6], “this work had been the main activity of the Rome
Institute in 1928”. As outlined in Sect. 2, the electrostatic potential inside an atom of
atomic number Z, at a distance r from the nucleus, can be cast in the form:

V (r) =

Ze
r

ϕ

r
µ !

,

 

(38)

where ϕ is the Fermi function discussed above and µ is given in Eq. (10). Based on this,
Fermi [29] calculated the number of electrons in an atom with given values of the orbital

12

angular momentum as function of the atomic number Z 5, thus succeeding to give an
account of the appearance of the elements in the periodic table. Of course it was readily
realized that, since the potential V (r) was determined by means of statistical arguments,
only average properties of the periodic system can be explained in terms of the Thomas-
Fermi model. Peculiarities of the electronic structure, underlying particular properties of
the elements, cannot be accounted for by a statistical method. Nevertheless, as noted by
Fermi himself, the agreement with the experimental observations is satisfactory.

The next step was to evaluate the energy levels of the quantum states of all (heavy)
elements. This was done by Fermi in [10] for the S-levels; in particular he calculated the
Rydberg correction for the S-levels of any element from the approximate solution of the
Schr¨odinger equation for an s-electron with zero energy. The energy levels corresponding
to the angular momentum l = 3, m = 2 (M-levels) for the X-ray spectrum were, instead,
considered by Rasetti [27]. Again the experimental points ﬂuctuate closely about the pre-
dicted values. A slightly diﬀerent application of the Thomas-Fermi potential was carried
out by Gentile and Majorana [28], who calculated the doublet separation due to spin for
optical and X-ray levels of some elements, applying the Dirac theory. Moreover they also
evaluated the ratio of the intensities of the absorption s-p lines in the alkali spectra. Some
further applications were performed by the Fermi group during 1928, mainly devoted to
explain the properties of the rare earths and the electron aﬃnity of the halogens, which
were discussed in a restricted conference in Leiprig under the chairmanship of P. Debye
[11].

Several generalization of the Thomas-Fermi method for atoms were proposed as early
as in 1928 by Majorana, but they were considered by the physics community, ignoring
the Majorana unpublished works, only many years later (see, for example, the review in
[30]).

Indeed, in Sect. 16 of Volumetto II [17], Majorana studied the problem of an atom in
a weak external electric ﬁeld E, i.e. atomic polarizability, and obtained an expression for
the electric dipole moment for a (neutral or arbitrarily ionized) atom.

Furthermore, he also started to consider the application of the statistical method
to molecules, rather than single atoms, studying the case of a diatomic molecule with
identical nuclei (see Sect. 12 of Volumetto II [17]). The eﬀective potential in the molecule
was cast in the form:

V = V1 + V2 −

α

2V1V2
V1 + V2

,

(39)

(40)

V1 and V2 being the potentials generated by each of the two atoms. The function α must
obey the diﬀerential equation for V ,

2V =

kV 3/2

(k is a suitable constant), with appropriate boundary conditions, discussed in [17]. Ma-
jorana also gave a general method to determine V when the equipotential surfaces are
approximately known (see Sect. 12 of Volumetto III [17]). In fact, writing the approxi-
mate expression for the equipotential surfaces, as functions of a parameter p, as

∇

(41)
5It is interesting to compare the deduction by Fermi in [29] with the one made by Majorana in Sect.

f (x, y, z) = p,

he deduced a thorough equation from which it is possible to determine V (ρ), when the
boundary conditions are assigned. The particular case of a diatomic molecule with iden-
tical nuclei was, again, considered by Majorana using elliptic coordinates in order to
illustrate his original method [17].

5 Conclusions

In this paper we have depicted the genesis and the ﬁrst developments of the statistical
model of atoms introduced by Thomas and Fermi in 1926-27. Far from being complete,
our account has focused on the results achieved by Fermi and his group in Rome, as given
evidence by many articles published in widespread journals. We have also pointed out the
practically unknown contribution to the model given by Majorana, who was introduced
to the subject by Fermi himself. One of the major results reached by Majorana as early as
in the beginning of 1928 is its solution (or, rather, methods of solutions) of the Thomas-
Fermi equation. This plays an important role in the rapid and accurate determination
of the eﬀective electrostatic potential in atoms, required in physical applications, as well
as in studying the mathematical properties of the diﬀerential equation itself, anticipat-
ing later (Mambriani, Scorza-Dragoni, Miranda 1929-1934) and much later (Hille 1969)
achievements. Majorana works on these topics (as well as in many other ones) is con-
tained in his notebooks [17] and was not published by the author: it is remained unknown
until recent times [17]. A brief account of the statistical model of atoms, which is widely
known, has been reported in Sect. 2, and follows quite closely the Fermi approach. 6
Wide room has been made to the solution of the Thomas-Fermi equation in Sect. 3; the
interested reader, looking for more technical details, can beneﬁt from a reading of papers
[19], [31]. Early applications of the Thomas-Fermi model, performed by the Fermi group
(as well as some other people), essentially dealt with atomic spectroscopy, and have been
discussed above in Sect. 4. Moreover we have also highlighted some completely novel
(for that time) applications of the statistical model by Majorana, who employed it for
studying atoms in external ﬁelds (atomic polarizability) and molecules.

From what discussed here, it is then evident the considerable contribution given by
Majorana even in the achievement of the Thomas-Fermi model, anticipating, in many
respects, some important results reached later by leading specialists.

Abstract

This is the second installment of a two-part paper on developments in quantum
dispersion theory leading up to Heisenberg’s Umdeutung paper. In telling this story,
we have taken a paper by John H. Van Vleck (1924b,c) as our main guide. In
this second part we present the detailed derivations on which our narrative in the
ﬁrst part rests. The central result that we shall derive is the Kramers dispersion
formula, which played a key role in the thinking that led to Heisenberg’s Umdeutung
paper. Closely following Van Vleck’s pre-Umdeutung approach, we derive classical
and construct quantum formulae for the dispersion, emission, and absorption of
radiation both for the special case of a charged harmonic oscillator (sec. 5) and for
arbitrary non-degenerate multiply-periodic systems (sec. 6). In sec. 7, we rederive
the same results using modern quantum mechanics. In sec. 8 we bring together the
main conclusions of our study.

Key words: Kramers dispersion formula, Correspondence Principle, Canonical
perturbation theory, Matrix mechanics

5 Van Vleck and the application of the correspondence principle

to the interaction of matter and radiation

In the two-part paper that forms the focal point of our study, Van Vleck
(1924b,c) explored in a systematic and physically cogent fashion the implica-
tions of the correspondence principle for several aspects of the interaction of
matter and radiation. The paper is signed June 19, 1924 and appeared in the
October 1924 issue of The Physical Review. In this paper, Van Vleck gives
a detailed derivation of the correspondence principle for absorption, which
he had introduced in a short note in the Journal of the Optical Society in
America, signed April 7, 1924 (Van Vleck, 1924a). In addition, he thoroughly
examined the issues involved in connecting Einstein’s A and B coeﬃcients
to features of classical electron orbits. Finally, as we mentioned in sec. 3.4 in
Part One of our paper, he showed that, in the limit of high quantum numbers,
Kramers’ quantum formula for polarization merges with the classical formula
for polarization in arbitrary non-degenerate multiply-periodic systems.

In part I of his paper, reproduced in (Van der Waerden, 1968), Van Vleck
(1924b) discusses the transition from quantum-theoretical expressions for emis-
sion, absorption, and dispersion to corresponding classical expressions that one
expects to hold in the limit of high quantum numbers. It is only in part II,
not included in (Van der Waerden, 1968), that Van Vleck (1924c) derives the
classical expressions for absorption and dispersion of radiation by a general
non-degenerate multiply-periodic system, using standard methods of canoni-
cal perturbation theory in action-angle variables. Van Vleck could assume his
audience to be thoroughly familiar with these techniques. This is no longer
true today. For the sake of clarity of exposition, we therefore invert the order
of Van Vleck’s own presentation.

In sec. 5.1, we present the basic elements of the canonical formalism in action-
angle variables and use it to rederive the classical formula (6) in sec. 3.1
for the dipole moment of a charged one-dimensional simple harmonic oscil-
lator. Though much more complicated than the derivation in sec. 3.1, this
new derivation has two distinct advantages. First, it suggests a way of trans-
lating the classical formula into a quantum formula with the help of Bohr’s
correspondence principle and Einstein’s A and B coeﬃcients. Secondly, both
the derivation of the classical formula and its translation into a quantum for-
mula can easily be generalized to arbitrary non-degenerate multiply-periodic
systems.

In sec. 5.2, we translate the classical formula for the dipole moment of a
simple harmonic oscillator into a quantum formula. In sec. 5.3, we similarly
convert classical formulae for emission and absorption by a simple harmonic
oscillator to the corresponding quantum formulae. Both the mathematical

2

manipulations and the physical interpretation are particularly transparent in
the case of a simple harmonic oscillator, and Van Vleck himself frequently used
this example for illustrative purposes. The generalization of the various results
to arbitrary non-degenerate multiply-periodic systems, which is a primary
focus of Van Vleck’s paper, will be deferred to sec. 6. In sec. 7, we present (or
outline) modern derivations of various results in secs. 5 and 6.

5.1 Deriving the classical formula for the dipole moment of a simple har-

monic oscillator using canonical perturbation theory

In this subsection we rederive formula (6) in sec. 3.4 for the dipole moment of
a charged one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator, using canonical pertur-
bation theory in action-angle variables. Like Kramers, Van Vleck was a master
of these techniques in classical mechanics. As Van Vleck recalled ﬁfty years
after the fact:

In 1924 I was an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota. On an
American trip, Ehrenfest gave a lecture there . . . [He] said he would like to
hear a colloquium by a member of the staﬀ. I was selected to give a talk
on my “Correspondence Principle for Absorption” . . . I remember Ehrenfest
being surprised at my being so young a man. The lengthy formulas for
perturbed orbits in my publication on the three-body of the helium atom
[Van Vleck, 1922b] had given him the image of a venerable astronomer
making calculations in celestial mechanics (Van Vleck, 1974, p. 9). 171

We begin by reviewing some of the mathematical tools we need. 172 Con-
sider a classical Hamiltonian system with phase space coordinates (qi, pi),
i = (1, 2, . . . N) and Hamiltonian H(qi, pi), which does not explicitly depend
on time. Hamilton’s equations are

˙qi =

∂H
∂pi

,

˙pi = −

∂H
∂qi

.

(15)

Consider a contact transformation (qi, pi) → (q′
i) preserving the form of
Hamilton’s equations, in the sense that there exists a new Hamiltonian H ′

i, p′

171Van Vleck failed to conform to Ehrenfest’s image of a young physicist in another
respect. In an interview in 1973, “Van Vleck recalled, “I shocked Ehrenfest . . . when
I told him I liked popular music.” Ehrenfest, he said, “thought that was completely
irreconcilable with my having written any respectable papers.”” (Fellows, 1985, p.
54)
172This material is covered in standard graduate textbooks on classical mechanics,
such as (Goldstein, 1980), heavily inﬂuenced by (Born, 1925) (Goldstein, 1980, pp.
429, 493, 540). We recommend (Matzner and Shepley, 1991).

which will not contribute to the variation of the action. The apparent depen-
dence of F on the 4N + 1 variables (qi, pi, q′
i, t) can be reduced to 2N + 1
variables via the equations for the contact transformation (qi, pi) → (q′
i).
If we choose to write F as a function of the initial and ﬁnal coordinates,
F = F (qi, q′
i, t), then the partial derivatives of F can be read oﬀ directly from
eq. (18):

(19)

By solving (at least in principle!) the second of these three equations for q′
i as
a function of (qi, pi), and then substituting the result in the third to obtain
p′
i, we see that the function F encodes the full information of the transforma-
tion (qi, pi) → (q′
i). This function is called the generating function of the
transformation. Given F the form of the new Hamiltonian H ′ can be obtained
(again, in principle!) from the ﬁrst of eqs. (19).

i, p′

A special case of great interest occurs when the generating function F can be
chosen so that the resulting Hamiltonian is independent of the new coordinates
q′
i (which are then called ignorable). Hamilton’s equations then immediately
imply that the associated momenta p′
i are time-independent, and that the new
coordinates q′
i are linear in time. In this circumstance the new momenta are
usually called action variables—the notation Ji is conventional for these—
while the new coordinates are dubbed angle variables, with the conventional
notation wi.

To illustrate the above with a concrete example, which we shall be using
throughout this section, consider a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator

173A short digression on the (almost inevitable) notational confusions lurking in this
subject is in order. We shall continue to use the conventional notation ω to denote
angular frequencies, with the ordinary frequency (reciprocal period) denoted by
the Greek letter ν. Unfortunately, Van Vleck uses ω to denote ordinary frequency!
Moreover, there is the embarrassing similarity of the angle variables wi to the fre-
quencies ωi. Also, there is the need to distinguish between the frequencies of the
isolated mechanical system (ω0 = 2πν0 for the simple harmonic oscillator) and the
frequency of an applied electromagnetic wave, which we shall denote as ω = 2πν
throughout.

Since H ′ = H, this means that the new coordinate variable q′ is ignorable, as
desired. Hamilton’s equations for (q′, p′) are:

˙q′ =

∂H
∂p′ = ω0,

˙p′ = −

∂H
∂q′ = 0,

from which it follows that q′ = ω0t+ǫ and that p′ = H/ω0 is time-independent.
Instead of the canonically conjugate variables (p′, q′) it is customary to employ
rescaled action/angle variables

J ≡ 2πp′, w ≡

2π

q′.

Hamilton’s equations for (J, w) are:

˙w =

∂H
∂J

= ν0,

˙J = −

= 0.

∂H
∂w

It follows that J = H/ν0 and w = ν0t + ǫ (appropriately redeﬁning the arbi-
trary phase ǫ) for our one-dimensional oscillator.

The connection to the terminology action variable is easily seen in this exam-
ple. In this simple case, the action is deﬁned as the area enclosed by a single
orbit of the periodic system in the two-dimensional phase space spanned by
the coordinates (p, q):

J =

(32)

We now turn to our basic model for dispersion, i.e., a charged one-dimensional
simple harmonic oscillator subjected to the periodically varying electric ﬁeld
of an electromagnetic wave. Earlier, we used elementary techniques of classical
mechanics to analyze this system (see eqs. (2)–(6) in sec. 3.1). Although such
methods are physically transparent, they depend on an explicit treatment of
the equations of motion of a speciﬁc and completely speciﬁed Hamiltonian.
The same results can be obtained by the methods of canonical perturbation
theory, where general formulas can be obtained for the perturbation in the
coordinate(s) of the system completely independently of the speciﬁc nature of
the dynamics. As Van Vleck put it:

2mω2

If we were to study the perturbations in the motion produced by the incident
wave purely with the aid of [Newton’s second law] it would be impossible to
make further progress without specializing the form of the potential function
[such as, e.g., 1
0q2 in eq. (20)] . . . However, it is quite a diﬀerent story
when we seek to compute the perturbations . . . in the “angle variables” w1,
w2, w3 and their conjugate momenta J1, J2, J3 . . . In fact by using them
rather than x, y, z, which is the essential feature of the present calculation,
the periodic properties of the system come to light even without knowing
the form of [the potential] (Van Vleck, 1924c, p. 350).

Using canonical perturbation theory in action-angle variables, we rederive eq.
(6) of sec. 3.1 for the polarization of a one-dimensional charged simple har-
monic oscillator. In sec. 6, we turn to the general case of an arbitrary non-
degenerate multiply-periodic system.

The Hamiltonian is now the sum of the Hamiltonian H0 given by eq. (20)
and a perturbative term Hint describing the interaction between the harmonic
oscillator and the electromagnetic wave: 174

H = H0 + Hint =

+

mω2

0x2 + eEx cos ωt.

(33)

p2
2m

2

The subscript ‘0’ in ν0 or ω0 refers to the characteristic frequency of the
unperturbed oscillator. Without subscript ν and ω refer to the frequency of
the external electric ﬁeld.

174As before, we assume that the electric ﬁeld is in the direction of motion of the
oscillator (cf. sec. 3.1). It follows from eq. (33) that the force F = −∂V /∂x of the
electric ﬁeld on the charge is −eE cos ωt, in accordance with eq. (3) in sec. 3.1 (recall
that we use e to denote the absolute value of the electron charge).

7

Absent a perturbing ﬁeld (E = 0, H = H0), we can write x(t) in terms of the
action-angle variables J and w = ν0t:

x(t) =

Aτ (J)e2πiτ w,

Xτ =±1

where Aτ has to satisfy the conjugacy relation Aτ = A∗
−τ to ensure that x(t) in
eq. (34) is real (x(t) = x∗(t)). Note that we have changed notation somewhat
compared to eq. (31). We returned to Cartesian coordinate notation (x instead
of q), and the amplitude has been redeﬁned: 175

D = 2|Aτ |.

The action-angle variables J = H0/ν0 and w = ν0t satisfy Hamilton’s equa-
tions (cf. eqs. (26)–(27)):

0 = − ˙J =

∂H0
∂w

,

∂H0
∂J

= ˙w = ν0.

It is a special feature of the simple harmonic oscillator that the frequency
ν0 is independent of the amplitude of motion (and thereby of the action).
The generating function for the contact transformation from (x, p) to (w, J)
is time-independent (cf. eq. (21)), so eq. (19) implies that the old and new
Hamiltonians coincide in value (i.e., one simply reexpresses the original Hamil-
tonian in the new variables). Even with the perturbation turned on we shall
continue to use the same contact transformation, computing the perturbations
(∆w, ∆J) induced by the applied ﬁeld in the action-angle variables (w, J) as
an expansion in E. These are not action-angle variables for the full Hamil-
tonian H0 + Hint, only for the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 (cf. Van Vleck
1926a, pp. 200–201).

Eventually, we are interested in the displacement ∆x in the particle coordinate
(to ﬁrst order in E) induced by the applied ﬁeld. To ﬁrst order, ∆x is given
by

∆x =

Using eq. (34) to evaluate ∂x/∂J and ∂x/∂w, we can rewrite this as:

To obtain the polarization, which is a linear eﬀect in the applied ﬁeld E, we
only need ∆J and ∆w to ﬁrst order in E. This means that the angle variables

tion is: 176

176 It is a special feature of the simple harmonic oscillator that the characteristic
frequency ν0 is independent of the amplitude and thus of the action variable J (see
eq. (32)). In general, ν0 will be a function of J. The ﬁrst term on the right-hand
side of eq. (43) would then become ∂H0/∂J = ν0(J) = ν0 + (∂ν0/∂J)∆J.

comes from the terms in eq. (45) with the same time-dependence as the applied
ﬁeld, i.e., from terms in which the time-dependence is given by the factor
e±2πiνt. In the terminology of Van Vleck (1924c, p. 361): “the part of the
displacement which is resonant to the impressed wave.” These are the terms
in which the summation indices, which in the case of the simple harmonic
oscillator only take on the values ±1, have opposite values, i.e., τ = −τ ′. The

Since |Aτ |2 = |A−τ |2 (see note 175) and since τ only takes on the values ±1
in the case of the simple harmonic oscillator, τ 2 = 1 and the two terms in the
summation over τ are identical. Although in this special case the derivative
with respect to J only acts on |Aτ |2, we are free to include the expression
2ν0/(ν2 −ν2

on J in this case). Eq. (48) then becomes

The resulting expression for the dipole moment, p(t) = −e∆xcoh, of a one-

sions for the dipole moment of a general non-degenerate multiply-periodic sys-
tem with the same charge given by Kramers and Van Vleck. Kramers (1924b,

In the special case of a one-dimensional charged simple harmonic oscillator, ω,

appears to be a factor e2 missing in Kramers’ formula. We shall derive the
corresponding formula (41) in (Van Vleck, 1924c, p. 361) in sec. 6.2.

Eq. (49) is equivalent to eq. (6) the result of our much simpler derivation in
sec. 3.1. Recalling that (cf. eqs. (31)–(32), eqs. (34)–(35) and note 175)

The preceding discussion employs a version of canonical perturbation theory in
which a single set of action-angle variables, chosen for the unperturbed Hamil-
tonian, is used throughout the calculation, even after the time-dependent per-
turbation is switched on. Accordingly, the new action variables are no longer
constant, and the new angle variables are no longer linear in time. The same
classical polarization result is derived in a somewhat diﬀerent manner by Born
(1924) and by Kramers and Heisenberg (1925). Born performs a contact trans-
formation in which the generating function F (cf. eq. (18)) is chosen as a
function of (qi, p′
i), the old coordinates and the new momenta, which is then
evaluated systematically order by order in the perturbation to maintain the
constancy of the new action variables. In (Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925) the
same procedure is followed, but as only the ﬁrst order result is needed, it
suﬃces to use the inﬁnitesimal form of the contact transformation. 177

5.2 Converting the classical formula for dispersion to a quantum formula in

the special case of a simple harmonic oscillator

Using Bohr’s correspondence principle as our guide, we now ‘translate’ the
classical formula (49) for displacement (and thence for polarization) into a
quantum formula. Two main ingredients go into this particular application
of the correspondence principle: (1) a rule—commonly attributed to Born
(1924) 178 but found and applied earlier by Kramers and Van Vleck (see
below)—for replacing derivatives with respect to the action variables in clas-
sical formulae by diﬀerence quotients involving neighboring quantum states;
(2) the A and B coeﬃcients of Einstein’s quantum theory of radiation. In gen-
eral, the ‘translation’ of a classical formula into a quantum formula involves
a third step. The orbital frequencies need to replaced by transition frequen-
cies. The case of a simple harmonic oscillator has the special features that the
only relevant transitions are between adjacent states and that the transition
frequency νi→f coincides with the mechanical frequency ν0. Another special
feature is that the correspondence between quantum and classical results for
large quantum numbers continues to hold all the way down to the lowest quan-
tum numbers, due to the extremely simple form of the energy spectrum, with
uniformly spaced levels.

Using the rule for replacing derivatives by diﬀerence quotients, the quantum
formula for polarization is obtained from (49) by the formal correspondence

where F (r) refers to any dynamical quantity associated with the quantum
state speciﬁed by the integer quantum number r. In the correspondence limit
where r gets very large, the diﬀerence between the values rh and (r + 1)h for
the action variable J become so small that the diﬀerence quotient to the right
of the arrow in eq. (54) becomes equal the derivative on the left. With this
prescription, the classical formula eq. (49) turns into a quantum expression
for the coherent part of the displacement of the particle in quantum state r:

The amplitudes Ar correspond to the Aτ (with τ = ±1) in eq. (49), and are
related to the amplitudes Dr in eq. (32) for an oscillator in state r by Dr =
2|Ar| (see eq. (51)). As we saw in sec. 3.3, Ladenburg (1921) showed how these
amplitudes can be connected to the Einstein A coeﬃcients for spontaneous
emission (not to be confused with the amplitudes Ar).

At this point we brieﬂy review Einstein’s quantum theory of radiation (Einstein,
1916a,b, 1917), using the notation of (Van Vleck, 1924b). Imagine an ensem-
ble of atoms—or indeed, any conceivable quantized mechanical system, such
as one-dimensional quantized oscillators—in interaction and statistical equi-
librium with an ambient electromagnetic ﬁeld of spectral density ρ(ν). If we
label the stationary states of the atoms by indices r, s, . . ., the number of
atoms in state r (of energy Er) by Nr, and recall the Bohr frequency condi-
tion νrs = (Er − Es)/h, Einstein’s analysis gives an average rate of energy
emission of light of frequency νrs for an atom in state r as

dEr→s

For a charged simple harmonic oscillator, the only allowed transitions amount
to changes in the action by one unit of Planck’s constant h, so there is only
a single Einstein coeﬃcient for spontaneous emission from the state r + 1,
namely Ar+1→r. The correspondence principle dictates that we associate the
rate of spontaneous energy emission for high quantum numbers,

(cf. eq. (56), in the absence of external radiation) with the classical result for
the power emitted by an accelerated (in this case, oscillating) charge, given
by the Larmor formula (Jackson, 1975; Feynman et al., 1964, Vol. 1, Ch. 32):

For an oscillator in state r, with x(t) = Dr cos ω0t, this becomes, for the

Of course, for the special case of the ground state of the oscillator, r = 0,
the second term in eq. (63) cannot be present. Ladenburg’s quantum formula
for dispersion accordingly only had the equivalent of the ﬁrst term in eq.
(63) (Ladenburg, 1921). The full equation corresponds to eq. (5) in (Kramers,
1924a), and to eq. (17) in (Van Vleck, 1924b), except for a factor of 3, as we
have not assumed random orientation of the oscillators (Van Vleck, 1924b,
footnote 25).

One may easily guess that the corresponding formula for a more general,
multiply-periodic system will take the form of (Van Vleck, 1924b, eq (17)), in
analogy to (63) (cf. eqs. (6)–(7)):

where the sum over s (resp. t) corresponds to states higher (resp. lower) than
the state r, and where νij is Van Vleck’s notation for the transition frequency
νi→j . In the correspondence limit where r is very large and neither s nor t
diﬀer much from r, the transition frequencies νsr and νrt become equal to the
orbital frequencies in the orbits characterized by the values rh, sh, and th
for the action variable J. For the harmonic oscillator, the sums in eq. (64)
degenerate to a single term each (with s = r + 1, t = r − 1), and the transition
frequencies νsr, νrt are all equal to the mechanical frequency ν0. In sec. 6.2 we
shall explain Van Vleck’s derivation of eq. (64) in detail.

From the point of view of classical dispersion theory, the terms in the second
sum in eq. (64) for polarization, corresponding to transitions to lower states,
have no direct physical interpretation. They appear to correspond to oscilla-
tors of negative mass (Kramers 1924a, 676; 1924b, 311)! In the early spring
of 1924 Van Vleck had already derived an expression for absorption with a
structure similar to that of eq. (64) for polarization (see sec. 6.3). In the case
of absorption, the terms with transitions to lower states are readily recognized
as corresponding to “negative absorption,” i.e., to the process of stimulated
emission introduced by Einstein.

As we indicated above, there is some disagreement in the historical literature
as to who was (or were) responsible for the key move in the construction of
the quantum dispersion formula on the basis of the correspondence principle,
viz. the replacement (54) of derivatives with respect to the action variable
by diﬀerence quotients. Jammer (1966, p. 193) and Mehra and Rechenberg
(1982–2001, Vol. 2, p. 173) suggest that Kramers got the idea from Born
via Heisenberg. Dresden (1987, p. 222) makes it crystal clear that Kramers
found the rule before Born, but allows for the possibility that Born found
it independently, as Kramers did not state the rule in his ﬁrst Nature note
(Kramers, 1924a), the only presentation of the Kramers dispersion formula

15

that Born had seen when he wrote (Born, 1924). Van Vleck certainly discov-
ered the replacement (54) of derivatives by diﬀerence quotients for himself.
Since Van Vleck (1924a) announced the correspondence principle for absorp-
tion, which he could not have derived without this rule, in a paper submitted
in April 1924, whereas (Born, 1924) was not received by Zeitschrift f¨ur Physik
until June 1924, Van Vleck clearly could not have taken the rule from Born’s
paper. Writing to Born later in 1924, Van Vleck sounds slightly annoyed at
Born’s insinuation that he, Van Vleck, somehow did not realize that one needs
to replace derivatives by diﬀerence quotients to get from classical to quantum-
theoretical expressions. In the letter from which we already quoted in sec. 2.4,
Born wrote to Van Vleck:

I am sending you my paper On Quantum Mechanics [Born 1924], which
pursues a goal similar to yours. While you limit yourself to the correspon-
dence with high quantum numbers, I conversely aim for rigorous laws for
arbitrary quantum numbers. 179

To which Van Vleck replied:

Thank you for your letter and reprint relating to “Quantum Dynamics, etc”
. . . I have read with great interest your important, comprehensive article.
There is, as you say, considerable similarity in the subject matter in your
article and mine, especially as regards to dispersion 180 . . . As noted in your
letter you mention more explicitly than do I the fact that formulas of the
quantum theory result from those of the classical theory by replacing a
derivative by a diﬀerence quotient. I have stressed the asymptotic connection
of the two theories but I think it is clear in the content of my article that in
the problems considered the classical and quantum formulas are connected
as are derivatives and diﬀerence quotients. 181

That Kramers, Van Vleck, and possibly Born independently of one another
hit upon the same idea, underscores that the rule (54) for replacing derivatives
by diﬀerence quotients is so natural that it readily comes to mind when one
is trying to connect quantum-theoretical expressions to classical ones on the
basis of the correspondence principle.

179Born to Van Vleck, October 24, 1924 (AHQP).
180Van Vleck seems to be talking here about (Van Vleck, 1924b,c), whereas Born
was talking about (Van Vleck, 1924a). Born asked Van Vleck to send him “an
oﬀprint of your extensive calculations.” Van Vleck obliged: “As you requested, I am
sending you under separate cover a reprint of Parts I and II of my computations,”
presumably (Van Vleck, 1924b,c).

5.3 Emission and absorption classically and quantum-theoretically in the spe-

cial case of a simple harmonic oscillator

Before we present Van Vleck’s “correspondence principle for absorption” (for
the special case of a simple harmonic oscillator), we gather some useful re-
sults from the classical theory of a charged oscillator (of natural frequency
ν0) coupled to a Maxwellian electromagnetic ﬁeld. Such an oscillator (i) emits
electromagnetic radiation of frequency ν0 in the absence of an external ﬁeld,
(ii) absorbs energy from an applied electromagnetic ﬁeld of frequency ν, and
(iii) undergoes a net displacement coherent with an applied electromagnetic
ﬁeld (or “polarization”, analyzed above).

The Larmor formula (60) gives the power loss due to radiation by our charged
harmonic oscillator. The energy loss of the oscillating system can be ascribed
to a radiative reaction force given by

Frad =

2e2
3c3 ¨v ≡ mτ ¨v,

˙v − τ ¨v + ω2

0x = 0.

¨x + τ ω2

0 ˙x + ω2

0x = 0.

where we shall assume that the characteristic time τ is very short in com-
parison to the mechanical period: ω0τ << 1, so that radiation damping is
very slow on the time scale of the mechanical oscillations of the system. The
equation of motion of the oscillator (in the absence of external applied forces)
now becomes

Now, to a good approximation, the coordinates and velocities of this system
are still behaving as harmonic oscillations of frequency ω0 so we may assume
¨v ≃ −ω2

0v in (66) and obtain

Inserting the Ansatz x(t) = De−αt into equation (67), we ﬁnd:

(α2 − τ ω2

0α + ω2

0)De−αt = 0.

Neglecting a term with τ 2ω4

0 (recall that ω0τ << 1, so that τ 2ω4

0 << ω2

182Such terms are treated incorrectly in any event by the approximation leading to
eq. (67).

Thus, we have a solution of the form

x(t) = De−Γt/2 cos ω0t,

from which the average rate of oscillator energy loss from the Larmor formula
(60) at small times (i.e., when damping due to the e−Γt/2 factor can be ignored)
is easily seen to be

motion (67) can be written as

0D). The constant Γ = τ ω2

¨x + Γ ˙x + ω2

0x = 0.

Now suppose that our charged oscillator is immersed in an ambient electro-
magnetic ﬁeld, characterized by a spectral function (energy density per unit
spectral interval) ρ(ν). As we are dealing with one-dimensional oscillators we
shall simplify the discussion by assuming that only the x-component of the
electric ﬁeld is relevant as all the oscillators are so aligned. Then (using over-
bars to denote time averages) the average value of the electromagnetic energy

density is (in Gaussian units) (1/4π) ¯E2 = (3/4π) ¯Ex

and the average rate of energy absorption of the oscillator from the ambient
ﬁeld is simply the time average < Fapp ˙x >. This linear second order equation
is solved by a sum of transients (i.e. solutions of the homogeneous equation:
see eq. (73))

xtr(t) = De−Γt/2 cos ω0t,

plus the following particular solution coherent with the applied perturbation

Note that the transient part of the particle coordinate xtr(t) is not coherent
with the applied ﬁeld (we assume ω 6= ω0), and therefore does not contribute to
the time average of the energy absorption. This explains why the amplitude D
of the oscillations is absent from the ﬁnal result, which will instead depend only
on the speciﬁc energy density of the ambient ﬁeld. In other words, even though
the charged particle may be executing very large amplitude oscillations xtr(t),
the only part of the full coordinate x(t) responsible for a nonvanishing average
absorption is the part of the displacement xcoh(t) induced by the applied ﬁeld,
which is proportional to E and does not involve the amplitude D. As we
shall see below, the corresponding feature of the quantum calculation in the
correspondence limit led Van Vleck to the very important realization that the
net energy absorption involves a diﬀerence in the amount of absorption and
stimulated emission as described in Einstein’s quantum theory of radiation.

Only the cosine part of the complex exponential in eq. (78) will contribute to
the time average. Using < cos2 ωt >= 1/2 and eq. (74), we ﬁnd

for the energy absorption rate due to the ambient ﬁeld in the frequency in-

E squared, it is apparent that the generalization of this linear simple har-
monic oscillator result to an arbitrary multiply-periodic system will require a
second-order canonical perturbation theory calculation, which will necessar-
ily be more involved than the corresponding classical polarization calculation,
which only involves the electric ﬁeld to the ﬁrst order. In the case of interest,
where Γ << ω0, the line resonance shape in eq. (79) is highly peaked around
the resonance frequency ω0, so we may use the distributional limit

This classical result is found in (Planck, 1921) (Van Vleck, 1924b, p. 339, note

when immersed in an ambient classical electromagnetic ﬁeld.

In eq. (62) we found the connection in the limit of high quantum numbers

The Einstein analysis of A and B coeﬃcients makes it clear that at the quan-
tum level we must consider what Van Vleck (1924b, p. 340) calls the “diﬀer-
ential absorption rate”: the rate of energy absorption of the oscillator in state
r going to state r + 1 via (57) minus the stimulated emission induced by the
ambient ﬁeld and causing the transition r to r − 1 (the B term in (56)). From
eq. (86) we therefore have for the diﬀerential absorption rate of an oscillator
in state r

which is precisely the classical result (81). Note that the dependence on the
quantum state r (or classically, the amplitude of the motion Dr) has cancelled
in the diﬀerential absorption rate, corresponding to the lack of coherence dis-
cussed previously between the transient and impressed motion.

Van Vleck derived this result in sec. 4 of his paper. He concluded:

We thus see that in the limiting case of large quantum numbers, where [eq.
(86)] is valid, the classical value [in eq. (81)] for the rate of absorption of
energy is nothing but the diﬀerential rate of absorption in the quantum
theory. This connection of the classical and quantum diﬀerential absorption

21

we shall term the correspondence principle of absorption (Van Vleck, 1924b,
p. 340). 184

In sec. 5, he generalized the result to arbitrary non-degenerate multiply-
periodic systems.

Van Vleck’s correspondence principle for ‘diﬀerential absorption’ (i.e., the
excess of absorption over stimulated emission) also clariﬁes the correspon-
dence principle for dispersion. As Kramers (1924a,b) emphasized, the nega-
tive terms in the dispersion formula were diﬃcult to account for on the basis
of purely classical concepts—they somehow corresponded to a negative value
for e2/m for those virtual oscillators corresponding to transitions from the
initial atomic level to lower energy levels (see sec. 3.4). Similar negative con-
tributions in the case of absorption are physically much more transparent:
transitions to higher levels result in a positive absorption of energy from the
ambient electromagnetic ﬁeld, whereas transitions to lower levels result in
energy being returned to the ﬁeld. The latter process was therefore known
as “negative absorption” at the time, a term used by both Kramers (1924a,
p. 676) and Van Vleck (1924b, p. 338). Noticing the greater physical trans-
parency of his correspondence-principle results for absorption, and under the
impression that Kramers’ correspondence-principle arguments for the disper-
sion formula rested only on a treatment of harmonic oscillators, Van Vleck
added sections on dispersion to his paper. Sec. 6, “The General Correspon-
dence Principle Basis for Kramers Dispersion Formula,” was added to the
ﬁrst quantum-theoretical part of the paper; sec. 15, “Computation of Polar-
ization,” to the classical part (see the letter from Van Vleck to Kramers of
September 1924, quoted in sec. 3.4). Van Vleck was thus the ﬁrst to publish
a fully explicit derivation of the correspondence limit for polarization in the
context of a general multiply-periodic system.

When Kuhn in his AHQP interview with Van Vleck brought up the paper
on the correspondence principle for absorption, Van Vleck said: “I think that
was one of my better papers.” “How did you get into that?,” Kuhn wanted to
know. Van Vleck told him:

Through a misunderstanding of something Gregory Breit [Van Vleck’s col-
league in Minnesota at the time] told me. He said that the net absorption
was the diﬀerence between the ﬂuctuations up and the ﬂuctuations down,
referred to some paper of—I think it was (Kretschmann)—but that was an
entirely diﬀerent thing. It was concerned with the fact that under certain
phase relations the light did work on the atom and under certain phase

184Van Vleck points out that this “is a purely mathematical consequence of the
correspondence principle for emission, which was used in deriving [eq. (86)]” (ibid.).
A few pages later, Van Vleck (1924b, p. 343) notes that he could also have done the
reverse, deriving the correspondence principle for emission from that for absorption.

22

relations the atom did work on the light. It was dealing essentially with sta-
tistical ﬂuctuations. I misunderstood his remark and proceeded to try and
get the diﬀerential eﬀect between the absorption up from a given stationary
state and a[b]sorption going down. 185

The paper Breit was referring to is presumably (Kretschmann, 1921). In this
paper, Erich Kretschmann (1887–1973), a student of Planck better known for
his work in general relativity (Kretschmann, 1917), gave a purely classical
discussion of the emission and absorption of radiation. What Van Vleck says
here about this paper ﬁts with its contents.

Van Vleck’s comments, however, are also very reminiscent of the following
passage in (Ladenburg and Reiche, 1923):

. . . according to Einstein’s assumptions the eﬀect of external radiation on
a quantum atom corresponds to the eﬀect a classical oscillator experiences
from an incident wave. When the frequency of such a wave does not diﬀer
much or not at all from the characteristic frequency of the oscillator, the
reaction of the oscillator consists in an increase or a decrease of its energy,
depending on the diﬀerence in phase between the external wave and the
motion of the oscillator. In analogy to this, Einstein assumes that the atom
in state i has a probability characterized by the factor bik to make a tran-
sition to a higher state k under absorption of the energy hν of the incident
wave (“positive irradiation”) and that the atom in state k has another prob-
ability (bki) to return to the state i under the inﬂuence of an external wave
(“negative irradiation”) (Ladenburg and Reiche, 1923, p. 586)

As we mentioned in sec. 3.3, Ladenburg and Reiche appealed to the corre-
spondence principle to justify their quantum formulae for emission, absorp-
tion, and dispersion. Except in the case of emission, however, their arguments
were fallacious. We conjecture that this is what inspired Van Vleck to use his
expertise in techniques from celestial mechanics—the kind of expertise Laden-
burg and Reiche clearly lacked—to derive the correct expressions for emission
and absorption merging with classical results in the sense of the correspon-
dence principle. 186 Van Vleck (1924b, p. 339, note 13; p. 344, note 21) cited

185P. 22 of the transcript of the ﬁrst session of the AHQP interview with Van Vleck.
Van Vleck told this story in somewhat greater detail to Katherine Sopka. He also
explained to her why he acknowledged Breit in (Van Vleck, 1924a, p. 28) but not in
(Van Vleck, 1924b,c): “As he [Van Vleck] remembers it, he wanted to thank Breit
in the latter, but Breit objected on the ground that the phase ﬂuctuations he had
in mind were quite diﬀerent from the diﬀerence eﬀect employed by Van Vleck and
so, overmodestly, felt no acknowledgment was in order” (Sopka, 1988, p. 135, note
184; this note makes no mention of Kretschmann).
186As we saw in sec. 3.4, Van Vleck’s calculations for dispersion were inspired by
(Kramers, 1924a).

23

Ladenburg and Reiche but gave no indication that their paper was an impor-
tant source of inspiration for his own. It is not implausible, however, that Van
Vleck simply preferred to pass over their badly ﬂawed calculations in silence
rather than touting his own clearly superior results. As we mentioned in sec.
3.3, one of the problems with the “correspondence” arguments of Ladenburg
and Reiche is that, following (Planck, 1921) and in the spirit of the derivation
of the A and B coeﬃcients in (Einstein, 1917), they focus on collections of
atoms in thermal equilibrium rather than on individual atoms. What is sug-
gestive of a possible inﬂuence of (Ladenburg and Reiche, 1923) on (Van Vleck,
1924b,c) is that the exact same passages of (Planck, 1921) are cited in both
papers (see note 183 above) and that Van Vleck (1924b) explicitly comments
on the issue of many atoms in thermal equilibrium versus single atoms, noting
that in Planck’s discussion “no explicit mention is made of the asymptotic
connection of the classical absorption and the diﬀerential absorption for a sin-
gle orbit (where thermodynamic equilibrium need not be assumed) which is
the primary concern of the present paper” (p. 340, note 14). The topic of a
third installment that Van Vleck originally planned to add to his two-part
paper also becomes understandable in light of our conjecture about the con-
nection between (Van Vleck, 1924b,c) and (Ladenburg and Reiche, 1923). As
Van Vleck explained in 1977 (see sec. 2.4): “Part III was to be concerned with
the equilibrium between absorption and emission under the Rayleigh-Jeans
law” (Van Vleck and Huber, 1977, p. 939). If Ladenburg and Reiche did in-
deed stimulate Van Vleck’s work, however, it is somewhat puzzling that he
does not seem to have recognized that the virtual oscillators of BKS, which,
as we saw in secs. 3.4, 4.1, and 4.2, he consistently attributed to Slater, were
essentially just the substitute oscillators of (Ladenburg and Reiche, 1923). We
also saw, however, that Van Vleck was hardly alone in associating virtual os-
cillators with BKS. We thus conclude that it is plausible that Van Vleck was
inspired by (Ladenburg and Reiche, 1923) to formulate correspondence prin-
ciples for emission and absorption. For one thing, this would explain why Van
Vleck, who had not worked on radiation theory before, turned his attention
to the interaction between matter and radiation.

6 Generalization to arbitrary non-degenerate multiply-periodic sys-

tems

6.1 The correspondence principle for absorption

The primary result of (Van Vleck, 1924b,c) was an extension of eq. (87) to an
arbitrary non-degenerate multiply-periodic system of a single particle in three
dimensions, and the demonstration that the quantum-diﬀerential absorption
coincides with this more general result in the correspondence limit. Before

24

giving Van Vleck’s result we recall some basic features of multiply-periodic
systems, which we shall in any event need in the next subsection when a
completely explicit derivation (following, with minor notational changes, the
one laid out by Van Vleck) of the corresponding formula for polarization will
be provided.

The transition from one-dimensional periodic (and harmonic) systems such as
the linear simple harmonic oscillator to three-dimensional multiply-periodic
ones is fairly straightforward. Apart from the obvious need to introduce vector
quantities, there are only two signiﬁcant additional features. First, there is the
appearance of multiple overtones in the general multiply-periodic expansion
(so that the multiplicity variables in the analogue of eq. (34) take arbitrary
positive and negative integral values, not just ±1). Second, the mechanical
frequencies ν1, ν2, ν3 (with νi = ∂H0/∂Ji) of the separated coordinates are
now in general functions of the amplitude of the classical path, which is to
say, of the action variables Ji (with i = 1, 2, 3). We assume as before that the
imposed electric ﬁeld is in the X-direction so the x-coordinate of our electron
is the relevant one for computing the induced coherent polarization, and in
analogy to eq. (34) we now have

x(t) =

A~τ e2πi~τ · ~w,

X~τ

where in the absence of the external ﬁeld the angle variables ~w = (w1, w2, w3) =
(ν1, ν2, ν3)t ≡ ~νt and ~τ = (τ1, τ2, τ3) with τi taking on all (positive and nega-
tive) integer values. It will be useful to write eq. (88) in an alternative purely
real form, as a cosine expansion:

x(t) =

X~τ cos (2π~τ · ~νt).

X~τ ,~τ ·~ν>0

The complex amplitudes A~τ satisfy the conjugacy condition A~τ = A∗
ensure that x(t) is real and we have the relation X 2

~τ = 4A~τ A−~τ . 187

−~τ to

As before (cf. eq. (33)), the full Hamiltonian has the form

H = H0 + eEx(t) cos 2πνt.

The subscripted mechanical frequencies νi with i = 1, 2, 3 (comprising the
vector ~ν) must be distinguished from the single frequency ν (unsubscripted)
corresponding to the applied ﬁeld.

Eq. (91) is the product of a highly nontrivial application of canonical pertur-
bation techniques, where quantities of second order in the applied ﬁeld need
to be properly evaluated (cf. discussion following eq. (79) above). The polar-
ization calculation presented in full in the next section only involves canonical
perturbation theory to ﬁrst order. For the absorption calculation, the variation
in the action variables ∆Jk in particular is needed to second order, and the
integration of the result obtained for a monochromatic incident ﬁeld needed
to pass to the case of continuous radiation speciﬁed by an arbitrary spectral
function ρ(ν) requires considerable care.

Slater also tried his hand at this calculation, as can be inferred from a letter
from Kramers to Van Vleck, from which we already quoted in sec. 3.4. Kramers
wrote:

Slater had, on my request, made the same calculation, and he stated that
the classical mean-absorption formula gave the right result in the limit of
high quantum numbers. I did, however, not see his formula, and am not
quite sure that he had not forgotten the term with ∂ρ/∂ν, without which
the thing is not complete of course. 188

Van Vleck clearly remembered this point almost forty years later. Talking to
Kuhn about his 1924 absorption papers, he mentioned: “I got the term in
partial rho with respect to nu. I’m very proud of the fact that I picked that
one up . . . Slater, at Kramers’ suggestion I guess, made a completely parallel

6.2 The correspondence principle for polarization

In this section we retrace the derivation given by Van Vleck (1924c) of the
classical polarization formula for a general non-degenerate multiply-periodic
system (with a single electron) in three dimensions. We remind the reader
that this result is by no means new to Van Vleck, nor, for that matter, to
Born or Kramers, who also produced derivations of the same result at around
this time, using slightly diﬀerent versions of canonical perturbation theory
(cf. our comments at the end of sec. 6.1). The formula obtained is basically
identical to a formula originally derived in celestial mechanics to compute the
perturbation in the orbits of the inner planets due to the outer ones. As we
saw in sec. 3.2, Epstein had been the ﬁrst to use the relevant techniques from
celestial mechanics in the context of the old quantum theory. As Van Vleck
reminded Slater: “The classical formula analysis to the Kramer[s] formula
appears to be ﬁrst ca[lc]ulated by Epstein [1922c].” 190

The derivation is basically a straightforward generalization of the derivation
of sec. 5.1 for the special case of a charged simple harmonic oscillator in an
electromagnetic ﬁeld (see eqs. (37)–(49)). The ﬁrst-order perturbation in the
coordinate x(t) (the direction of the electric ﬁeld in the incident electromag-
netic wave) corresponding to the shifts (∆Jl, ∆wl) in the action-angle variables
is given by the three-dimensional version of eq. (37):

∆x =

∆Jl +

∆wl.

∂x
∂Jl

∂x
∂wl

(93)

As in sec. 5.1, we imagine that the external ﬁeld is switched on at time zero,
so that the shifts (∆Jl, ∆wl) are the integrals of their time derivatives from 0
to t. In analogy with eq. (42) and using eq. (88) for x(t), we can immediately
write down the equation for ∆Jl to ﬁrst order in E:

All the terms inside the summation can be taken to zeroth order in the applied
ﬁeld. The computation of the ﬁrst-order shifts ∆wl is a little more involved as

new terms, not present in the harmonic-oscillator case, enter (cf. note 176).

Both terms in eq. (95) contribute to the ﬁrst-order deviation ∆ ˙wl from the
value of νl for the unperturbed system. Since νl depends on Jk, there will be a
term (∂νl/∂Jk)∆Jk (cf. note 176). The second term is just the generalization
of the corresponding term in eq. (43). Hence, we get:

∆ ˙wl =

As in sec. 5.1, we are only interested in the coherent contribution to the
polarization, so we drop all terms in eq. (100) whose time dependence is not
precisely e±2πiνt and ﬁnd, writing for convenience τk(∂/∂Jk) ≡ ~τ · ~∇J,

Note that the coherent contribution derives from terms in which ~τ ′ = −~τ , as
otherwise the uncancelled overtones from the mechanical system would shift
the spectral line (as in Raman scattering). Essentially the only additional
physics of (Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925) in comparison to (Van Vleck, 1924b,c)
is a detailed examination of such terms, predicted earlier by Smekal (1923).
The terms in eq. (101) involving sin 2πνt vanish, as can be seen with the help
of the identities

number of electrons per unit volume (the subscript r refers to the fact that

which is eq. (41) in (Van Vleck, 1924c; in Van Vleck’s notation, ~τ · ~ν is written
ωτ ) and equivalent to eq. 2∗ in (Kramers, 1924b) (see eq. (50) above).

The equivalence of eq. (104) to the Kramers dispersion formula (64) in the
correspondence limit is sketched in (Kramers, 1924b) and fully explained in
sec. 6 of (Van Vleck, 1924b). 191 Here we follow the latter. So we begin with eq.
(64) for the polarization of a quantized system in state r, without the factor
of 3 corresponding to the assumption that all oscillators be aligned with the
applied ﬁeld (rather than randomly in 3 dimensional space), and writing Nr
instead of nosc:

The sums over s (resp. t) refer to states higher (resp. lower) in energy than
the ﬁxed state r under consideration. In the correspondence limit, we take the
state r to correspond to very high quantum numbers (n1, n2, n3). The states
s, t are associated to the central state r in symmetrical pairs:

s → (n1 + τ1, n2 + τ2, n3 + τ3),
r → (n1, n2, n3),
t → (n1 − τ1, n2 − τ2, n3 − τ3),

(106)

with ~τ · ~ν > 0 so that the states s (resp. t) do indeed correspond to higher
(resp. lower) energy states. Furthermore, we assume that ~τ · ~ν << ~n · ~ν so
that the transitions s → r → t correspond to very slight changes in the
classical orbitals (and diﬀerences approximate well to derivatives). The Bohr-
Sommerfeld quantization condition (1) associates action values Ji = nih with
a given quantized state, so the formal correspondence principle becomes (cf.
eq. (54) in sec. 6.2):

δ~τ F (~n) ≡ F (~n) − F (~n − ~τ ) → h~τ · ~∇J F.

7 Derivation of the formulae for dispersion, emission, and absorp-

tion in modern quantum mechanics

Describing the impact of the new quantum mechanics on dispersion theory,
Van Vleck wrote in 1928:

Dispersion was particularly bothersome in the old quantum theory, which
could never explain why the resonance frequencies in dispersion were exper-
imentally the spectroscopic frequencies given by the Bohr frequency con-
dition rather than the altogether diﬀerent frequencies of motion in orbits
constituting the stationary states [cf. our discussion in the introduction of
sec. 3]. The new mechanics, however, yields the Kramers dispersion formula,
previously derived semi-empirically from the correspondence principle . . . As
the result of the masterful treatment by Dirac [1927], a mechanism has at

31

last to a certain extent been found for the previously so mysterious quan-
tum jumps between stationary states . . . Dirac’s work brings out nicely the
parallelism between matter and radiation, and their corpuscular and wave
aspects, which are complementary rather than contradictory (Van Vleck,
1928a, pp. 494–495).

That same year, in the ﬁrst installment of what would turn out to be an
eight-part paper entitled “Investigations of anomalous dispersion in excited
gases,” Ladenburg likewise provided a brief synopsis of recent developments
in dispersion theory:

The ﬁrst successful treatment of dispersion phenomena on the basis of
Bohr’s atomic theory implicitly contained the assumption that the orbital
frequencies of the Bohr electrons are the special values at which dispersion
changes sign. 192 In contrast to this, the point of departure of the newer
development of dispersion theory is the empirical fact that not the orbital
frequencies of the electrons but the frequencies, observable in emission and
absorption, of “quantum jumps,” i.e., spectral lines, are the singular values
of anomalous dispersion. These correspond to the characteristic frequencies
of quasi-elastically bound electrons in the classical electron theory [discussed
in sec. 3.1]. Tying together the notions of this theory with Bohr’s atomic
theory has taught us that the “strength” of the dispersion or of the “substi-
tute oscillators,” which at Bohr’s suggestion were introduced as carriers of
the scattered radiation needed for dispersion, is determined in non-classical
fashion by the “strength,” i.e., the probability of quantum jumps[,] and by
the density of atoms in the “lower” atomic state involved in such quantum
jumps. 193 H. A. Kramers then showed, 194 through correspondence consider-
ations, that the dispersion formula obtained by the author [cf. eq. (8) in sec.
3.3] only holds exactly in the case of non-excited or meta-stable atoms; in
the case of excited non-meta-stable atoms, which can also make spontaneous
transitions to states of lower energy, this formula is incomplete and has to
be supplemented by terms of “negative dispersion,” which correspond to the
“negative absorption” [i.e., stimulated emission] of the radiation theory of
Planck and Einstein. Thus originated the “quantum-theoretical dispersion
formula” [cf. eq. (9) in sec. 3.4] which has ﬁnally been given a fully con-
sistent foundation in quantum mechanics and wave mechanics; 195 this new

192At this point, Ladenburg refers to the papers by Sommerfeld, Debye, and Davisson
and the criticism of them by Bohr and Epstein that we discussed in sec. 3.2.
193At this point, Ladenburg refers to his own work, Bohr’s favorable reaction to it,
and his subsequent work with Reiche, all discussed in sec. 3.3.
194At this point, Ladenburg refers to Kramers’ two Nature notes and to the Kramers-
Heisenberg paper discussed in sec. 3.4.
195At

this point, Ladenburg refers

quantum theory completely avoids concepts like orbital frequencies of elec-
trons in stationary states, and one of its points of departure was precisely
the quantum-theoretical interpretation of dispersion phenomena mentioned
above (Ladenburg, 1928, pp. 15–16)

Rather than pursuing the history of dispersion post-Umdeutung, we shall
present our own modern derivations of quantum formulae for dispersion (sec.
7.1), (spontaneous) emission (sec. 7.2), and absorption (sec. 7.3). Seeing how
modern quantum mechanics sanctions the formulae found by Kramers, Van
Vleck and others in the old quantum theory on the basis of Einstein’s quan-
tum theory of radiation and Bohr’s correspondence principle will illuminate
various aspects of the relation between the old and the new theory.

First, we show how the orchestra of virtual oscillators of pre-Umdeutung dis-
persion theory survives in the guise of a sum over matrix elements of the
position operator. Second, we show how the diagonal matrix elements of the
fundamental commutation relation for position and momentum, [X, P ] = i~,
are given by the high-frequency limit of the Kramers dispersion formula, a for-
mula known as the Thomas-Kuhn(-Reiche) sum rule (Thomas, 1925; Kuhn,
1925; Reiche and Thomas, 1925). This formula replaces the Bohr-Sommerfeld
condition as the fundamental quantization condition in the Umdeutung paper
(see sec. 3.5). Heisenberg obtained the sum rule by applying the procedure
introduced in the Umdeutung paper for translating classical quantities into
quantum-theoretical ones to (a derivative of) the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantiza-
tion condition. He then showed that the sum rule also obtains by comparing
the high-frequency limit of the Kramers dispersion formula with the polar-
ization of a charged harmonic oscillator in the limit where ν >> ν0 (see our
eq. (53)). In hindsight, we can see clearly in the Umdeutung paper how close
Heisenberg came to recognizing the presence of the commutation relation be-
tween position and momentum in the sum rule serving as his quantization
condition. As he told Kuhn:

I had written down, as the quantization rule the Thomas-Kuhn sum rule,
but I had not recognized that this was just pq minus qp. That I had not
seen. 196

That he did not take this step is probably due to two important obstacles,
one conceptual, the other technical. The conceptual framework of the entire
Umdeutung paper is Lagrangian (as opposed to Hamiltonian): the essential
problem is to ﬁnd a quantum-theoretical reinterpretation of the classical con-
cepts of position x(t) and velocity ˙x(t) of a particle. Indeed, the conventional
symbol for momentum, p, appears only once in the entire paper, in the state-

(Mehra and Rechenberg, 1982–2001, Vol. 5, pp. 789–796).

ment of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition (eq. (12) in the paper).
From this point on, p is replaced everywhere by m ˙x(t). The canonical connec-
tion between position and momentum (so central, ironically, to the canonical
perturbation theory that led to the dispersion formula in the ﬁrst place 197 )
seems simply to have vanished from Heisenberg’s thinking at this point. The
other, technical, obstacle was an inconvenient division of the sum over quan-
tum states in the sum rule, which, though very natural from the point of
dispersion theory, obscured its connection to a commutator, as we shall see
below.

It will also become clear in the course of our modern derivation that the
Kramers dispersion formula is an even more general result in modern quantum
mechanics than it was in the old quantum theory. In the old quantum theory,
it held for any non-degenerate multiply-periodic system with an unperturbed
Hamiltonian such that the unperturbed motion can be solved in action-angle
variables. In modern quantum mechanics, the result holds for any system with
a Hermitian Hamilton operator such that the unperturbed part has a spectrum
that is at least partially discrete. This helps to explain why the Kramers
dispersion formula carries over completely intact from the old quantum theory
to modern quantum mechanics.

7.1 Dispersion

In this subsection, we derive the Kramers dispersion formula in time-dependent
perturbation theory. We then examine the high-frequency limit of this formula
and discuss the role it played in (Heisenberg, 1925) paper as the fundamental
quantization condition replacing the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition.

We consider a quantized charged system (valence electron) with states labeled
by discrete indices r, s, t, ..., and with the Hamilton operator

H = H0 + V (t) = H0 + eEx cos ωt.

(111)

We want to calculate the ﬁrst-order perturbation (in the electric ﬁeld E) in
the expectation value of the electron position in a particular state |r, t >. It
is convenient to work in the interaction picture. 198 The state |r, t >int in the

197Of course, it was also central to (Dirac, 1925).
198The special role of H0 in the time dependence of states and operators in the
interaction picture is analogous to the choice of action-angle variables for the free
rather than the full Hamiltonian in the version of canonical perturbation theory used
by Van Vleck. This is what lies behind the close similarities between the calculations
in this section and those in secs. 5.1 and 6.2.

interaction picture is related to the state |r, t > in the Schr¨odinger picture via:

|r, t >int≡ eiH0t/~|r, t > .

Oint(t) ≡ eiH0t/~Oe−iH0t/~.

An operator Oint(t) in the interaction picture is related to the corresponding
operator O in the Schr¨odinger picture via

It follows that expectation values are the same in the two pictures:

int< r, t|Oint(t)|r, t >int=< r, t|O|r, t > .

The evolution of the states in the interaction picture is given by:

|r, t >int =

i

~ eiH0t/~H0|r, t > +eiH0t/~ ∂
i
~ eiH0t/~ (H0 − H) |r, t >,

∂t

=

|r, t >

where in the last step, we used the Schr¨odinger equation

|r, t >= −

iH
~ |r, t > .

Since H0 − H = −V (t) (see eq. (111)), we can write eq. (115) as:

∂

where we used eqs. (112)–(113). To ﬁrst order in Vint(t) (i.e., to ﬁrst order in
the ﬁeld E), the solution of (117) is

|r, t >int = |r, 0 >int −

dτ Vint(τ )|r, 0 >int

dτ xint(τ ) cos ωτ|r, 0 >int .

At t = 0 the states (and operators) in the interaction picture coincide with
those in the Schr¨odinger picture. From now on we thus simply write |r > for
|r, 0 >int. The dual (‘bra’) of the vector (‘ket’) in eq. (118) is:

int< r, t| =< r| +

To ﬁnd the dipole moment Pr(t) of the system in state r to ﬁrst order in

< ∆x >r≡ int< r, t|xint(t)|r, t >int − < r|xint(t)|r > .

Inserting eqs. (118)–(119) into this expression, we ﬁnd:

This result is ﬁrst obtained by Heisenberg from the Bohr-Sommerfeld quanti-
zation condition by applying the quantum-theoretical transcription procedure,
which was introduced in sec. 1 of the Umdeutung paper and had been inspired
by dispersion theory. It replaces the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition as the fun-
damental quantization constraint in Heisenberg’s new theory. That the same
result can be obtained directly from the high-frequency limit of the Kramers
dispersion formula is clearly regarded by Heisenberg as strong evidence for

199Or, alternatively, when the incident photon energy far exceeds the energy needed
to ionize the electron, so that the latter can be regarded as essentially a free, un-
bound particle.
200This result is obtained in (Kuhn, 1925) by equating the energy scattered by an
electron in the Thomson limit to the radiation emitted by an oscillating dipole
according to the Larmor formula.

(131)

(132)

the validity of his transcription procedure. Using eq. (132), together with the
formal transcription of the classical equation of motion, ¨x + f (x) = 0 (eq.
(11) of the Umdeutung paper), Heisenberg (1925) asserts the possibility of “a
complete determination not only of frequencies and energy values, but also of
quantum-theoretical transition probabilities” (p. 268). As Heisenberg points
out, eq. (132) is completely equivalent to the sum rules for oscillator strengths
derived by Thomas (1925) and Kuhn (1925). 201

The realization that eq. (132) is equivalent to (the diagonal matrix elements
of) the fundamental commutator relation [P, X] = ~/i of modern quantum
theory came shortly after this, in the work of Born and Jordan (1925). The
recognition of eq. (132) as a commutator is mathematically obscured by the
separation of the sum into states higher (s) and lower (t) than the given
state r—a separation which is very natural given the history of the Kramers
dispersion formula. If Heisenberg had applied his own transcription rules for
associating classical variables with quantum two-index quantities to the mo-
mentum P ≡ m ˙X in the unnumbered equation immediately following (13) in
the Umdeutung paper (Heisenberg, 1925, p. 267), he would have found (using
modern matrix notation): 202

Prs = imωrsXrs.

(133)

That Heisenberg did not write down this equation is, as we suggested above,
because he was thinking in terms of the Lagrange rather than the Hamilton
formalism. Rewriting eq. (132) as a single sum over all states s, but splitting
the sum into two equal pieces via the identity 2ωsr = ωsr − ωrs, we ﬁnd

h = 4πm

s

(XrsωsrXsr − ωrsXrsXsr)

(134)

201Heisenberg’s logic is slightly diﬀerent from ours. Instead of pointing out that
the high-frequency limit (130) of the Kramers dispersion formula and the well-
established classical result (131) imply Heisenberg’s quantization condition (132),
Heisenberg (1925, pp. 269–270) points out that eqs. (132) and (130) imply eq. (131).
This is only a cosmetic diﬀerence. The point of the exercise is still to show that the
new quantization condition, found through Umdeutung of the derivative of the Bohr-
Sommerfeld condition, follows from well-established results in Kramers’ dispersion
theory and classical electrodynamics. We are nonetheless grateful to Christoph
Lehner for alerting us to this point.
202Following Heisenberg’s procedure in the Umdeutung paper for translating classi-
cal equations into quantum-mechanical ones, we would translate his classical equa-
α aα(n)iαωneiαωnt, into the following quantum-
tion for momentum, m ˙x = m
mechanical equation: P (n, n + α) = ima(n, n + α)ω(n, n + α). In modern notation,
this becomes: Prs = imXrsωrs (no summation).

(135)

Although Heisenberg recognized the signiﬁcance of the noncommutativity of
quantum-theoretic quantities in his formalism (see the last three paragraphs
of sec. 1), the simplicity of x(t)p(t) − p(t)x(t) implied by his fundamental
quantization relation (132) eluded him. He was thinking in terms of velocity
rather than momentum. Moreover, even if he had been thinking in terms of
momentum, the origin of his quantization condition in dispersion theory might
well have prevented him from rewriting the summations the way we did in eq.
(134).

7.2 Spontaneous emission

To begin with, we note that we are dealing throughout with the dipole ap-
proximation, which is implicit in the 1924 work, corresponding to the regime
where the wavelength of light is much larger than atomic dimensions (or equiv-
alently, where photon momentum is much smaller than electron momentum).
Once again, note that the notation of (Van Vleck, 1924b, eq. (1)),

x =

X(τ1, τ2, τ3) cos {2π(τ1ω1 + τ2ω2 + τ3ω3)t + . . .}

(cid:27)

implies that van Vleck’s D2 = X 2 + Y 2 + Z 2 (Van Vleck, 1924b, line follow-
ing eq. (8)) corresponds to four times the square of the matrix element of
the quantum position operator appearing in the dipole transition formulas of
modern quantum mechanics. For the latter we shall follow the treatment of
(Baym, 1969, Ch. 13).

In the dipole approximation, the spontaneously emitted power per unit solid

40

angle is given by (Baym, 1969, p. 282, eq. 13–100), for emitted light of polar-
ization vector ~λ, in a transition from state r to state s:

3

Xi,j=1

Here (unlike Baym) we take real polarization vectors ~λ (plane polarized) rather
than complex (circularly polarized) ones as our basis. We want the total spon-
taneously emitted power in any event, summed over the two possible polar-
izations for any momentum vector ~k of the emitted photon (so the basis of
photon states is irrelevant). This requires the polarization sum

λiλj = δij − ˆki

ˆkj,

(i, j = 1, 2, 3),

(138)

2

Xλ=1

which follows from the fact that the two polarization vectors are any pair of
orthogonal unit vectors perpendicular to the unit vector ˆk along the photon
direction. Finally, we want the total power emitted in any direction, so the
polarization sum (138) must be integrated over all solid angles:

dΩˆk(δij − ˆkiˆkj) = 4π(

δij).

The Einstein coeﬃcient Ar→s in (Van Vleck, 1924b, eqs. (5) and (9)) refers to
a rate of photon emission (not energy emission) so we must divide eq. (137)
by ~ω. Putting together the above results (and switching to ν = ω/2π), we

r is the amplitude deﬁned by (Van Vleck, 1924b) immediately following eq.

be identical.

7.3 Absorption

The Einstein formula for absorption (Van Vleck, 1924b, eq. (6)), when com-
bined with the stimulated emission (“negative absorption”) term to yield
(ibid., eq. 15)), leads directly to the correspondence limit result (ibid., eq.
(16)). Here, we check the identity of eq. (15) in (Van Vleck, 1924b) (more
precisely, the unnumbered equation immediately following this one) with the
modern absorption calculation given in (Baym, 1969). For the rate of absorp-
tion of light leading to a transition from state s to (higher) state r, (Baym,
1969, eq. 13–40) reads (in dipole approximation, ~j~k → ~p/m):

As usual, in dipole approximation we can use (Baym, 1969, eq. 13–98) to
replace matrix elements of the momentum operator with those of the coordi-
nate operator (using the equations of motion). For Hamiltonians of the form
H = (~p2/2m) + V (~x),

where ~ω = Er − Es. Once again, in eq. (145), we see the “monstrous” dif-
ference frequencies characteristic of quantum theory, which wreaked havoc on

42

classical interpretations of radiation phenomena, making their appearance in
the modern formalism. Accordingly, eq. (143) becomes

Now we are going to assume that the ambient light is unpolarized and isotropic
so that the squared amplitude |A~k~λ|2 is in fact independent of λ, ˆk, and the
only angular dependence comes in via the polarization vectors. The angle
average of the polarization sum in eq. (146) can then be performed as in eq.

Next, we need to establish the relation between the squared mode amplitudes
|A~k~λ|2 and the speciﬁc energy density function ρ(ν) deﬁned as the energy per
unit volume per unit frequency interval. The mode amplitudes A~k~λ correspond
to discrete modes for electromagnetic radiation in a box of volume V , with
each mode contributing energy density

(Baym, 1969, eq. 13–14). As the box volume goes to inﬁnity we have the usual

Inserting eq. (152) into eq. (147) and multiplying by ~ω to get the rate of

which coincides with the ﬁrst term in van Vleck’s equation (Van Vleck, 1924b,

upward transitions. Of course, the second (negative absorption, or stimulated
emission) term is of exactly the same form (with a minus sign) due to the
symmetry of the Einstein B coeﬃcients.

8 Conclusion

Our study of Van Vleck’s two-part paper on the application of the corre-
spondence principle to the interaction of matter and radiation (Van Vleck,
1924b,c) has led us to consider three clusters of questions. First, there are
questions about the paper itself. What made Van Vleck decide to work in
this area? He had not published on radiation theory before. And—as one is
inevitably tempted to ask—why did Van Vleck not take the next step and
arrive at something like matrix mechanics? That gets us to the second cluster
of questions, about the developments in quantum theory that provide the nat-
ural context for Van Vleck’s work, especially the transition of the old quantum
theory of Bohr and Sommerfeld to matrix mechanics. What was important for
this development and what was not? The third group of questions concerns
the relative importance of American contributions to these developments. In
this ﬁnal section we collect the (partial) answers we have found to these bio-
graphical, conceptual, and sociological questions.

44

Let us ﬁrst dispose of the issue of American contributions to early quantum
theory. Since we focused on the work of only two individuals, Van Vleck and
Slater, we are in no position to draw strong conclusions. Still, it seems safe
to say that our study supports the thesis of Sam Schweber (1986) and others
that, by the early 1920s, the United States had a homegrown tradition in
quantum theory, which, to be sure, was reinforced, but certainly not created
by the inﬂux of European ´emigr´es in the 1930s. We are less sanguine about
the thesis of Alexi Assmus (1992) that American theorists contributed mainly
to molecular rather than to atomic physics, although she may be right that
Slater and Van Vleck are just the exception to the rule (see sec. 2.4). However,
we did come across several other contributions (some admittedly minor) to
atomic theory by Americans (Breit, Davisson, Hoyt, Kemble) or by Europeans
working in America (Epstein, Swann). And we do want to emphasize that the
contributions to atomic theory by our main protagonists were absolutely ﬁrst
rate, even if they did not always receive the recognition they deserved from
their European colleagues (see the correspondence between Born and Van
Vleck cited in secs. 2.4 and 5.2). The quickly refuted but highly inﬂuential
Bohr-Kramers-Slater (BKS) theory was built around Slater’s idea of a virtual
radiation ﬁeld emitted by an atom while in a stationary state (see sec. 4.1).
The derivation of a correspondence principle of absorption for a general non-
degenerate multiply-periodic system, the centerpiece of (Van Vleck, 1924b,c),
is a tour de force that may well have been the most sophisticated application
of the correspondence principle in the old quantum theory. All in all, the
Americans had deﬁnitely established a presence in atomic theory by the early
1920s. In the period we examined, they were certainly more prominent than
the British, not to mention the French. Ultimately, however, the decisive steps
were taken in Europe, not in the United States.

This brings us to the question of why Van Vleck stopped short of these de-
cisive steps. Before we oﬀer our best guess as to why Van Vleck did not do
what he did not do, we want to say a few words about why he did what he
did. His papers on the correspondence principle for absorption (Van Vleck,
1924a,b,c) constitute his ﬁrst foray into quantum radiation theory. His earlier
publications had dealt with such topics as the extension of Bohr’s model of
the atom to helium and the speciﬁc heat of molecular hydrogen. The formu-
lation of a correspondence principle for absorption, Van Vleck told Kuhn in
his interview for the AHQP in 1963, had been triggered by a comment of his
Minnesota colleague Breit (see also Van Vleck, 1924a, p. 28). Breit’s remark,
we conjectured (in sec. 5.3), may have directed Van Vleck to the work of
Ladenburg and Reiche (1923), who proposed quantum formulae for emission,
absorption, and dispersion, invoking but not always correctly implementing
the correspondence principle. Van Vleck constructed his own quantum formu-
lae for emission and absorption and used his considerable expertise in classical
mechanics to show that these formulae as well as the Kramers dispersion for-
mula merged with the classical formulae in the limit of high quantum numbers.

45

So why did Van Vleck not take the next step? The trivial explanation is that
he was too busy working on his Bulletin for the National Research Council on
the old quantum theory (Van Vleck, 1926a) to pursue his own research. But
even if he had not been burdened by this Bulletin, we seriously doubt that
Van Vleck would have done what Heisenberg did—as he himself acknowledged
both in a biographical statement prepared for the AHQP and in his interview
for the project (see sec. 1.2). Van Vleck, it seems, was too wedded to the orbits
of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory to completely discard them, a prerequisite for
Heisenberg’s Umdeutung. This is clear at several points in (Van Vleck, 1924b).
At the end of sec. 1, for instance, we ﬁnd a formula expressing the Einstein
coeﬃcient Ar→s as an average over the frequencies of orbits, not allowed by
the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition, between the initial state r and
the ﬁnal state s. Sec. 2 of the paper is devoted to “a correspondence principle
for orbital distortions” (Van Vleck, 1924b, p. 334, our emphasis). On the issue
of how seriously one should take the orbits of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory,
Van Vleck might have beneﬁted from direct contact with the Europeans. He
had the distinct disadvantage of reading Sommerfeld instead of talking to Bohr
and his circle. 203 Bohr and Pauli certainly prepared Heisenberg for the step
of leaving orbits behind.

The emphasis on observable quantities in the Umdeutung paper, however,
struck a chord with Van Vleck, who had been primed for such a positivist turn
by his Harvard teacher Bridgman. 204 Explaining the new quantum mechanics
in Chemical Reviews in 1928, 205 he wrote:

Heisenberg’s epoch-making development of the matrix theory was spurred
by Born’s repeated emphasis to his colleagues at G¨ottingen that the reason
the old quantum theory was then (1925) failing was that we were all too
anxious to use the same concepts of space and time within the atom as
in ordinary measurable large-scale events. . . . the concepts of distance and
time have a meaning only when we tell how they can be measured. This is

203According to Alexi Assmus (1992, pp. 8, 15), Americans had a tendency to follow
Sommerfeld rather than Bohr anyway.
204In the biographical note written for the AHQP, Van Vleck wrote: “I suspect
that Bridgman’s operational philosophy may have subconsciously inﬂuenced my
approach to theoretical physics.” At a ceremony honoring Bridgman’s 1946 Nobel
prize, Slater went as far as suggesting a genetic link between Bridgman’s opera-
tionalism and Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle! Schweber (1990) quotes Slater as
saying on this occasion: “It is very likely that this principle, so much like Bridg-
man’s attitude, is actually derived to a very considerable extent from Bridgman’s
thinking” (p. 391).
205For the beneﬁt of the chemists, Van Vleck (1928a) compared a matrix to a base-
ball schedule: “the entry in row 3 and column 2, for instance, gives information
about a transition between a 3 and 2 quantum state, just as the analogous baseball
entry does about the meetings between teams 3 and 2” (p. 469).

46

very nicely emphasized in Bridgman’s recent book, “The Logic of Modern
Physics” [Bridgman, 1927] . . . one cannot use a meter stick to measure the
diameter of an atom, or an alarm clock to record when an electron is at
the perihelion of its orbit. Consequently we must not be surprised if within
the atom the correlation of space and time is something which cannot be
visualized, and that models cannot be constructed with the same kind of
mechanics as Henry Ford uses in designing an automobile. . . . The goal of
theoretical physics and chemistry must ever be to explain observable rather
than unobservable phenomena . . . What the physicist observes about an
atom is primarily its radiations . . . We may say that we have a sound atomic
theory when we have a set of a small number of mathematical postulates
from which these observed things can be calculated correctly, even though
it forces us to discard the usual space-time models (Van Vleck, 1928a, p.
468).

Van Vleck was thus ready enough to give up orbits once Heisenberg had shown
the way. He failed to take this step on his own.

The study of Van Vleck’s paper illuminates various aspects of the transition
from the old quantum theory to matrix mechanics that tend to get obscured
when one approaches these developments through, say, (Kramers and Heisenberg,
1925). Most importantly perhaps, following (Van Vleck, 1924b,c) rather than
(Kramers and Heisenberg, 1925) or (Born, 1924), we were able to give a trans-
parent and explicit version of the derivation needed to show that the crucial
Kramers dispersion formula reduces to the classical formula in the limit of
high quantum numbers (see secs. 5.1–5.2 for the special case of a simple har-
monic oscillator, sec. 6.2 for the generalization to arbitrary non-degenerate
multiply-periodic systems, and sec. 7.1 for a closely analogous derivation of the
Kramers formula in modern quantum mechanics). That Van Vleck conﬁrmed
the Kramers dispersion formula without relying on the Bohr-Kramers-Slater
(BKS) theory makes it particularly clear that matrix mechanics grew directly
out of dispersion theory and that BKS was mainly a sideshow (see sec. 4). The
only element of the BKS theory used by Van Vleck is the concept of virtual os-
cillators. We saw that this concept actually predates BKS. ‘Virtual oscillators’
was Bohr’s new name for the substitute oscillators introduced into dispersion
theory the year before and at Bohr’s suggestion by Ladenburg and Reiche
(1923). In addition to popularizing the notion of virtual oscillators, BKS may
have contributed to instilling skepticism about the electron orbits of the Bohr-
Sommerfeld theory. In that sense, it might have helped Van Vleck had he
embraced BKS more wholeheartedly. Overall, however, we argued that BKS
played no role in the breakthrough to matrix mechanics. The same is true for
the broad acceptance of Einstein’s light-quantum concept following the dis-
covery of the Compton eﬀect. Physicists working in dispersion theory, while
accepting the Compton eﬀect as decisive evidence for light quanta, happily
continued to treat light as a wave phenomenon.

47

What was it about dispersion theory that made it so important for the transi-
tion from the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory to the theory of Heisenberg’s Umdeu-
tung paper? As we suggested in the introduction of sec. 3, the answer is that
the discrepancy between orbital frequencies and radiation frequencies—one
of the most radical, if not the most radical aspect of the Bohr model of
the atom—manifested itself glaringly and unavoidably in dispersion theory.
The natural approach to adapting the successful classical dispersion theory of
Lorentz and Drude to Bohr’s new theory inevitably led to a dispersion formula
with resonance poles at the orbital frequencies (Sommerfeld, 1915b; Debye,
1915; Davisson, 1916; Epstein, 1922c), whereas experiment clearly indicated
that the resonance poles should be at the radiation frequencies, associated in
Bohr’s theory with transitions between orbits. Employing Einstein’s quantum
theory of radiation and Bohr’s correspondence principle (in conjunction with
techniques from celestial mechanics customized to the problems at hand) and
building on pioneering work by Ladenburg (1921) and Ladenburg and Reiche
(1923), Kramers (1924a,b) constructed a quantum formula for dispersion with
resonance poles at the transition frequencies rather than at the orbital frequen-
cies and claimed that this formula merged with the classical formula in the
limit of high quantum numbers. Van Vleck (1924b,c) was the ﬁrst to publish an
explicit proof that the Kramers quantum formula does indeed merge with the
classical formula for dispersion in a general non-degenerate multiply-periodic
system in the correspondence limit. The three key moves in translating the
classical formula into a quantum-theoretical one were to (1) replace orbital
frequencies by transition frequencies; (2) relate amplitudes to Einstein’s A co-
eﬃcients; and (3) replace derivatives with respect to the action variable by
diﬀerence quotients. The ﬁrst move goes back to the embryonic version of
the correspondence principle in (Bohr, 1913) (Heilbron and Kuhn, 1969, pp.
274–275). Ladenburg (1921) introduced the second move. It was made more
precise by Kramers and Van Vleck (cf. Jordan’s remarks quoted in sec. 2.4).
Born (1924) is usually credited with the third move and the rule for replacing
derivatives by diﬀerence quotients is sometimes even called “Born’s correspon-
dence rule” (Jammer, 1966, p. 193) or “Born’s discretizing rule” (Cassidy,
1991, p. 181). It was found earlier, however, by both Kramers and Van Vleck
(see the discussion at the end of sec. 5.2).

The Kramers dispersion formula no longer contains any reference to the or-
bits of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory, but only to transitions between them.
This signaled to Heisenberg that orbits could be dispensed with altogether.
Dispersion theory further told Heisenberg how to generate quantum formulae
from classical formulae in his Umdeutung scheme. The procedure consisted of
the same three moves listed above: one had to replace (1) classical frequencies
(more speciﬁcally: the Fourier overtones of the classical mechanical motion) by
quantum transition frequencies; (2) classical amplitudes associated with deﬁ-
nite orbits by quantum transition amplitudes associated with pairs of station-
ary states; and (3) derivatives by diﬀerence quotients. Dispersion theory also

48

furnished the fundamental quantization condition for Heisenberg’s new theory.
Heisenberg formulated this condition by applying his Umdeutung procedure
to the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantum condition, which was no longer acceptable
because of its explicit reference to orbits. That Heisenberg’s new condition
also emerged in the high-frequency limit of the Kramers dispersion formula
(see sec. 7.1) convinced him that he had found a sensible replacement for the
Bohr-Sommerfeld condition. The relevant formula had been found in quan-
tum dispersion theory before and was known as the Thomas-Kuhn(-Reiche)
sum rule (Thomas, 1925; Kuhn, 1925; Reiche and Thomas, 1925). Van Vleck
actually was the ﬁrst to ﬁnd this rule, even though he did not emphasize the
result because he thought it was problematic (see sec. 3.5). According to Roger
Stuewer (private communication), Van Vleck was nonetheless very proud of
this achievement and used to mention it with pride to various colleagues in his
later years. The Kramers dispersion formula and its corollary, the Thomas-
Kuhn sum rule, are the critical physical ingredients in the ﬁrst two sections
of (Heisenberg, 1925), in which the Umdeutung procedure is motivated. Van
Vleck was fully cognizant of these same ingredients by mid-1924. Van Vleck
can thus truly be said to have been on the verge of Umdeutung in Minnesota
in the summer of 1924.

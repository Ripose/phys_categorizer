Dirac’s Wave Mechanical Theory of the
Electron and Its Field Theoretical
Interpretation∗

By Cornel Lanczos in Berlin
(Received on October 31, 1929)

Version ISRI-04-13.2 March 3, 2008

Abstract

Lecture held at the meeting of the Berlin Physical Society, October 25,
1929. (Editorial note: In this paper Lanczos discusses a nonlinear general-
ization of Proca’s equation, derived from his “doubled Dirac equation,” such
that the mass is multiplied by a scalar ﬁeld function.)

The admirable success of recent theoretical research in the ﬁeld of atomic
physics, on the one hand, and the undeniable and irreplaceable wealth of great
ﬁeld theoretical achievements of the last century, on the other, have accustomed
us, in recent years, more and more to a type of unpleasant dualistic thinking which
is apparently unavoidable. As a result of this dualistic thinking, we must assume
entirely different structures for the laws governing phenomena in empty space —
in the aether, in the “ﬁeld” as we like to say — and for the laws of phenomena in
which interactions between atoms and molecules, or also between radiation and
matter, play a role. The difference is not one of degree, but is so incisive that one
needs a completely different intellectual attitude for conceptually understanding
one or the other types of contexts.

There have been no lack of attempts by this or that camp at abolishing these
differences in favor of a uniﬁed point of view. Attempts have been made to
consider the ﬁeld theoretical ideas as belonging to a somewhat childish stage of
physical thinking. These ideas would have to be sacriﬁced with the advancement
of knowledge in favor of less intuitive concepts and formulations, which are

considerably more complicated, almost dialectical, though [they are] in better
agreement with immediate experience. On the other hand, even one of the greatest
of the discoverers in the new ﬁeld, Schr¨odinger, has made an attempt at putting
the quantum laws on a pure ﬁeld theoretical footing by constructing a kind of
wave optics based on analytical dynamics and Fermat’s principle. The function,
which he denotes by ψ, which ought to govern the entire atomic realm as far
as quantum-like processes are concerned, is distributed over the entire space and
has a completely ﬁeld theoretical character. Moreover, he gave this function a
direct physical interpretation by having brought it into direct connection with the
distribution of electric charge — with the density of electricity. This approach
has, however, gained little credibility for two reasons. First, contrary to early
expectations, it is impossible to construct an electron by the interference of spatially
dispersing waves so as to arrive at a formation as stable as one would like to have
for the electron in an empirically founded ﬁeld theory. Furthermore, the entire
theory is founded on something foreign to the ﬁeld theoretical approach, namely,
on analytical dynamics. Though the rule of how to arrive at a wave equation does
lead to a wave theory in the usual space-time world in the case of a single body,
this result, nonetheless, is better considered as one of mere chance. Whenever
several bodies act on each other, it becomes senseless to try to connect the wave
equation formed according to the corresponding rule — which has stood the test
of experience — with reasonable ﬁeld theoretical ideas.

However great the success which has been achieved by the wave equation
found by Schr¨odinger, of late years a gap has evolved between the authority of
analytical dynamics and the authority of the fundamental wave equation deduced
from analytical dynamics in a particular way.

From the very beginnings of the new abstract quantum physics that superseded
Bohr’s atom model, a peculiar difﬁculty arose, the essence of which could not be so
easily explained. I have in mind what is called, in short, the “rotating electron” or
“electron spin.” It is well-known how fundamentally this hypothesis controls the
entire system of [spectroscopic] terms; what is more, the whole periodic system
— indeed, the entire shell structure of the elements — has found its place so that
by means of this hypothesis, which was introduced somewhat post festum, even
the old Bohr model would have been able to describe facts qualitatively correctly
in a quantitatively sketchy manner.

Such a hypothesis could evidently be incorporated into quantum mechanics by
means of a suitable reinterpretation of concepts. But all was so artiﬁcial, so out of
the clouds, so incomprehensible that one could hardly avoid the uneasy feeling, or
brush off the suspicion, that something fundamental was lacking or that there was
something wrong there. And that, in fact, was the case.

2

Thanks to the young English theoretician, Dirac, the solution of the enigma
was found. He did not brood at all over the electron spin; this welcome result
came to light rather later as an unexpected — but just for that very reason an even
more precious gift — as so often happens with scientiﬁc discoveries.

It was another matter that made him reconsider Schr¨odinger’s theory. The
Schr¨odinger equation had a remarkable feature:
it was ﬁrst-order in time, but
second-order in spatial coordinates. How could it happen, since the theory of
relativity had established so convincingly the essential equality of space and time?
Either everything must be of ﬁrst-order, or everything must be of second-order.
What is more, both could be conceived to be valid at the same time. It might be
that a ﬁrst-order equation is the primary, and then, by another differentiation, a
second-order equation (now also second-order in time) of a kind from which the
Schr¨odinger wave equation could be obtained.

Does such a ﬁrst-order wave equation exist? If it existed, it would have been
discovered long ago, since a fundamental importance had always been attributed to
it from Laplace on — remember also its special case, the potential equation — in
mathematics and in the entire ﬁeld of theoretical physics. But Dirac, following his
own way since the foundation of the new quantum theory, could do many things
which until then where unsuspected, because he was working with quantities which
had not been in common use earlier.

It is a commonplace truth for us that two times three is as many as three times
two. Mathematics, however, knows of quantities for which the interchangeability
of the order of factors fails. These are the so-called non-commuting quantities.
And Dirac had the original idea to track the failure of earlier physics, in relation
to the subtleties of atomic dynamics, back to the practice of always calculating as
if the commutation law were valid. Indeed, nature realizes quantities that do not
follow this rule and for which precisely another commutation law is valid in which
Planck’s quantum of action h, so fundamental for all quantum phenomena, enters
in a characteristic way. He calls such non-commuting quantities “q-numbers” in
contrast to usual numbers which he calls “c-numbers.” By using such q-numbers,
it was not difﬁcult for him to ﬁnd the required equation. It contained, indeed, only
ﬁrst derivatives, both of factors and unknown quantities entered as q-numbers.
Furthermore, a repeated application of the equation provided the already-known
Schr¨odinger equation as a mathematical consequence. Hence, this equation is
here not the starting point but rather a consequence. And, in addition, the new
conception proved its superiority. When an external ﬁeld was present, one did
obtain exactly the Schr¨odinger equation. Additional terms were left over, and
a closer analysis revealed that these terms provided just the corrections for the
spectral terms that had to be forced from the unnatural and, in its quantitative

3

details, ad hoc hypothesis of the spinning electron. It was a remarkable success,
not to be attributed to a mere accident, considering the entirely different viewpoint
of the deduction.

However much of Dirac’s conception of quantum mechanics differs from the
other ways adopted, it coincides with those in its consequences because Heisen-
berg’s fundamentally new method of using matrices — i.e., quadratic arrangements
of numbers — in the discussion goes parallel to that of Dirac in that these matri-
ces do not follow the law of commutativity of multiplication. One can regard a
matrix as a direct representation of a “q-number.” One can get from Heisenberg
to Dirac by regarding matrices consisting of a great number, even of inﬁnitely
many elements in general, in totality as a whole, by labeling it with a letter and
introducing it in mathematics as a non-commuting algebraic number. Conversely,
one can avoid Dirac’s non-commuting quantities by replacing them with matrices
that are then built up of normal numbers, which corresponds more to the usual
way of thinking.

If we do so with Dirac’s wave equation, the use of matrices leads to the effect
that in place of a single equation we shall have a system of equations and in place
of the only fundamental function ψ we shall have a series of functions of that
kind. The one Dirac equation becomes a system of ﬁrst-order partial differential
equations. To put it more clearly, a system of four complex equations with four
complex unknowns.

The development from Schr¨odinger to Dirac may be illustrated by an historical
analogy. It corresponds perfectly to the development of wave optics from Fresnel
to Maxwell. Fresnel used a wave equation which was a single scalar equation.
Though it was known that light must be a vectorial phenomenon because of the
transversality of light vibration, a detailed conception was left out of consideration
until it appeared in Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory by itself. Though Maxwell’s
equations are of the ﬁrst-order, the propagation of electromagnetic phenomena
with light velocity and the wave equation can be derived from them, all having
been taken by Fresnel as a basis of his theory. Indeed, the analogy with quantum
mechanics is complete. The difﬁculty the Schr¨odinger scalar theory ran into
because of the spin effect may be compared to the difﬁculty Fresnel met by letting
light through a boundary layer between two media with different optical densities.
Fresnel hinted at the correct relations with an admirable sense of tact, but was
compelled to make assumptions which have proved to be problematic. Maxwell’s
theory provided the right boundary conditions automatically and with necessity.

In one respect, our analogy is yet not really correct. Maxwell’s theory was a
true ﬁeld theory in the sense that one could ascribe to the quantities in it a rational
meaning, representable by geometric, i.e., vectorial formations. By comparison,

(m is the mass of the electron, c is the velocity of light, h is the quantum of action).
The four complex quantities ψ1 to ψ4 are to be regarded as functions of the three
spatial coordinates x, y, z and the time t.

The equations appear rather unattractive. The various coordinates enter in very
different ways. So the terms differentiated with respect to x and z are multiplied
everywhere by i, while this is not the case with y. One thus has the impression that
a vectorial framework would be given in space with numbered axes. In fact, it is not
so. We may carry out an arbitrary rotation of the axes, and even more far-reaching,
an arbitrary Lorentz transformation without any change of the system of equations.
As we say, there is an invariance under the group of Lorentz transformations. This
also corresponds completely to the character of Maxwell’s equations.

But the laws the complex quantities ψ follow under transformation have a
structure radically different from what we are accustomed to for a vector or a ﬁeld
intensity and the like. We ought to vaguely imagine these ψ functions as auxiliary
quantities of fundamental importance for the events of quantum mechanics but
without the possibility of ascribing to them a direct meaning. Fortunately —
and this is very remarkable — one can construct quadratic expressions of the ψ
quantities that have a proper ﬁeld theoretic meaning. Let us write out the following
four expressions:

It can be seen that these
four quantities together make a so-called “four-vector” that unites what occurs

in the usual three-dimensional interpretation as current density (the ﬁrst three
expressions) and charge density (the fourth expression, without the factor i). The
fourth expression corresponds to a quantity interpreted by Schr¨odinger as “the
density of electricity.” In this interpretation, vectors with components of the
ﬁrst three rows would complete electric density by electric current.
Indeed, as
a consequence of ﬁeld equations (1) connecting the quantities ψ, the important
circumstance exists that a conservation law holds: the increase of electricity in an
arbitrary volume is equal to the amount of electricity introduced by the current.

For reasons discussed above, we are inclined to give the quantities introduced
by Schr¨odinger a more abstract meaning by interpreting them as statistical quan-
tities, as probabilities, namely, as the number of particles found in unit volume on
the average. The completing vector then means the “probability ﬂux:” the number
of particles crossing the unit surface per unit time on the average. The conservation
law mentioned means here the conservation of the number of particles endowed
with ﬁxed charge.

So much for the essentials of Dirac’s theory. And now I arrive at the point
where my own investigations come in. I have made the attempt — better to say
a chance [gelegentliche] observation led me — to enlarge the [Dirac’s] theory in
such a way that it obtains a true ﬁeld theoretic character. We cannot yet do it
actually with the system of equations given above. There is, however, in the last
term a constant 2πmc/h that I denoted by α. It is only its square that enters the
wave equation and we are not sure whether to take the last term with positive or
negative sign — both are permitted. Now the idea comes to take into consideration
not this or that possibility but both together. Evidently we must rather ascribe each
sign to a separate system of functions ψ instead of to one and the same one. We
shall thus have 8 complex equations with 8 complex functions ψ. The entire
α),
system, now equivalent to two equations of Dirac (one with +α, one with
has more general transformation properties than any of the equations taken alone,
and it is now possible to implement the longed-for ﬁeld theoretical approach. The
mathematical development impressively shows how unambiguously the way is
prescribed to the realization of the program, but I shall leave it aside, and shall just
give the result.2 The foregone historical analogy used with Maxwell’s equations
will now provide a direct factual background.

As is well-known, Maxwell carried out various modiﬁcations on his equations
in order to apply them to ponderable bodies. However, the theory of electrons
recognized a part of these modiﬁcations superﬂuous and retained only the electron
charge and the corresponding convection current. The equations with this addition
read:

The system of equations (4B) may be solved by introducing potentials, the “vector

If we consider Dirac’s equations doubled as indicated above, we can also unite

them by a convenient arrangement in a system very similar to that of Maxwell.

The only difference is that in Maxwell’s equations only the electromagnetic
ﬁeld intensity plays the role of a fundamental ﬁeld quantity. The vector potential
is introduced only as an auxiliary quantity to help in solving the equations. In
our new system, however, the vector potential together with the ﬁeld strengths are
ﬁeld quantities; in the equations they occur as primary quantities. The second

7

system of Maxwell’s equations and equations (5) are equivalent; we could replace
equations (4B) by equations (5) from the very beginning. We do not do so since
equations (5) contain no direct relations between ﬁeld intensities, but introduce
new entities. Here, however, we have reasons to replace the second system of
Maxwell by equations (5). In effect, the ﬁrst of the Maxwellian system occurs
now in a modiﬁed form in which the potentials also appear:

Summarizing, we have ten ﬁeld quantities: the electromagnetic ﬁeld intensity
(6 components) and the vector potential (4 components). Ten ﬁeld equations hold
between them. We shall write them once more in a collected form:3

Indeed, if we compare system (6) and equations (4) of the theory of electrons,

We do not want to conceal that in case we make everything real the general
system of 2 times 8 equations, equivalent to the two equations of Dirac, contains
more quantities and more equations than has been indicated so far. Maxwell’s
equations show a characteristic dichotomy to the effect that only an electric four-
current occurs in them and no magnetic one. In the face of the extensive symmetry
in the equations, this could not a priori be expected. Effectively,
between
this dichotomy did not really come to light in the general scheme directly obtained
by the transcription of the doubled Dirac equation.
If there is also a magnetic
current present, we may conceive the ﬁeld as a superposition of two ﬁelds: the
case with an electric current and without a magnetic one, on one hand, and, [on
the other hand,] the opposite case with a magnetic current and without an electric
in the second case (to put
one. We need only interchange the roles of
H
) and the ﬁeld intensity can be expressed by a “magnetic
H
vector potential.” Then the total
will be composed additively of the
corresponding partial expressions. These make 6 equations. There is further the
assertion that the electric current is proportional to the electric vector potential
and the magnetic to the magnetic one; they make 2 times 4, i.e., 8 equations.
Finally, the equation of continuity for the electric and magnetic currents are again
2 equations: altogether, there are 16 equations.

Indeed, there here are two more scalars in the general equations of Dirac which
Maxwell’s theory completely lacks — precisely as a consequence of the equation
of continuity. If we retained them, (and thus dropped the equation of continuity),
we would in fully generality have the following quantities: electromagnetic ﬁeld
intensity (6 components), electric and magnetic vector potential (2 times 4, i.e.,
8 components) and 2 scalars; altogether, 16 ﬁeld quantities in accord with the 8
complex ψ quantities. In the new interpretation, everything becomes real and only
reasonable ﬁeld theoretical quantities will play a role.

Now we have important reasons to reduce the number of these quantities and

4We may express our equations in the uniﬁed four-dimensional language of relativity with the

remain at the already given equations (6) for which this reduction has already been
performed.

Let us consider from the point of view of our assignment, the four expres-
sions (2) bilinearly constructed from the fundamental quantities which according
to Dirac form a four-vector: They have here a signiﬁcantly different interpretation
due to the modiﬁcation of the transformation properties. They transform no longer
as current densities and charge density (as a four-vector) but as a current of energy
and an energy density. Dirac’s conservation law turns simply into the conservation
of energy.

Actually, the remarkable circumstance holds that these expressions, when cal-
culated with our ﬁeld quantities, coincide completely with the Poynting vector
and the energy density of Maxwell’s theory, insofar as they depend on the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld intensities. But additional terms still come in with the vector
potential included. If we put α = 0, then we should have Maxwell’s equations
in vacuum and, at the same time, the energy balance of Maxwell’s theory in an
unchanged form. As a consequence of the modiﬁcation of Maxwell’s equations
by introducing terms containing α2 in system (6A), the expressions for energy ﬂux
and energy density will also be modiﬁed. Additive terms appear with the factor
α2, which now depend no more on the ﬁeld intensity but on the vector potential,
so that its character as a primary ﬁeld quantity becomes manifest here, too.

Quite similar circumstances prevail in the 3 equations, which can be added to

the conservation of energy and which express the conservation of momentum.

Altogether, the 16 quantities appearing in the conservation laws of momentum
and energy form as a whole the so-called “stress-energy tensor.” A fundamental
feature of this tensor is its symmetry. This important feature would be lost should
we keep all the quantities which appear in the general scheme. In particular, the
two scalars which are missing in Maxwell’s theory determine an asymmetry which
manifests itself by the presence of a magnetic current beside the electric. If we
intend to retain the fundamental symmetry of the stress-energy tensor, we ought
to drop all quantities which are also foreign to Maxwell’s theory. At the same
time, the dichotomy having come to light in Maxwell’s equations would become
well-understood.

Although we started with a doubling of Dirac’s equation and therefore also
doubled the number of fundamental quantum mechanical quantities, we arrived
by this additional restriction at a system which does not exceed by very much a
single equation of Dirac (10 ﬁeld quantities instead of 4 complex ψ). What is
more, if we consider our system from the point of view of initial conditions, the
restriction is even stronger than with Dirac. There is a time derivative in all the 4

10

functions there so that all the 4 equations may be freely chosen for the moment
t = 0 in order to determine the system. Here, however, the total course in time
(i.e., only 6 conditions). Indeed ϕ

It is very stimulating to see how both our ﬁeld equations and our expressions
for stress and energy are so closely related to Maxwell’s theory and to the theory of
electrons, respectively. If we could construct an electron from our equations, we
should a priori be sure that the momentum-energy balance would hold at each point
of the ﬁeld. In this area, the theory of electrons is known to have grappled with
great difﬁculties. To preserve this balance even at points where there is a charge,
one had to resort to a hypothetical mechanical momentum and a corresponding
energy. These factors emerge in our theory automatically in the correction terms
mentioned above, which add to Maxwell’s expressions and can effectively be
interpreted as mechanical momentum and energy.5

In this circumstance, the idea suggests itself that a viewpoint could be found
for the elimination of the conﬂict mentioned at the beginning between the ﬁeld
theoretical and quantum mechanical approaches and for the extension of the ﬁeld
theoretical basis to quantum phenomena. The equations of Dirac’s theory we have
dealt with so far hold only in the case of one electron, without external ﬁeld. When
an external electromagnetic ﬁeld is present, Dirac’s equations should be completed
according to a certain prescription, in which the vector potential of the external ﬁeld
is introduced as a given quantity. If we consider the close relationship between the
equations obtained and the theory of electrons, it must be highly improbable that
a conventional theory of electrons might be constructed which gives us a vector
potential, and then still another special theory of electrons for quantum mechanics.
Because our theory already has a vector potential, it is very natural to use it also
for the electromagnetic ﬁeld of the electron, i.e., to identify it with the usual vector
potential. The additional terms by which we have to complete the equations will
then not postulate any external ﬁeld quantities, but will contain only the proper
ﬁeld functions. In particular, they ought to occur quadratically, because Dirac’s
additional terms are linear in the ψ and linear in the external vector potential. The
equations of the free electron thus would hold as a ﬁrst approximation to a system
of equations that are nonlinear in reality, the contributions due to the external ﬁeld
representing second-order correction terms. Actually, we have ample indication

that an adequate ﬁeld theory can be built only on nonlinear equations. The fact
that the solution of a linear equation remains a solution even when multiplied
by an arbitrary factor indicates a freedom which has no counterpart in nature. It
must, however, be added at once that this nonlinear extension of our equations,
which should replace the introduction of external ﬁelds, has not yet been done in
a satisfactory manner.

We shall now consider our system (6) from the viewpoint that a fusion with the
theory of electrons is conceivable in the sense that the classical theory of electrons
would hold as a ﬁrst approximation.
It is easy to realize that this plan is not
simple to implement. The constant α is not at all small but rather very large (of
1010 cm−1) so that these terms in no case may be considered
the order of 2.6
as a correction, nor can the normal vacuum equations of the theory of electrons
be obtained even approximately. If one realizes that the quantum phenomena are
actions at interatomic distances while the classical ﬁeld theory governs the more
distant regions void of matter, then one comes to suspect that the constant α is not
to be regarded as a true constant. Rather, it is to be replaced by a ﬁeld function that
takes a high value in the central regions, but drops outwards to a very low value.
In a physically consistent ﬁeld theory it would be hopeless in any case to introduce
a constant with the value of the mass of the electron: the mass difference between
the electron and proton would be from the beginning deprived of an explanation.

We can introduce another approach from a different viewpoint in order to
intrinsically rehabilitate this assumption. Einstein’s theory of relativity showed
that energy is always linked with mass, and mass, for its part, also gravitates, i.e.,
the geometry of space is inﬂuenced. We might attempt to ﬁnd a direct connection
between the stress-energy tensor we found and the Riemannian curvature tensor
as was the case with the stress-energy tensor of Maxwell’s theory. However, since
we are quite ignorant of the intrinsic meaning of our equations, a linkage without
internal necessity would hardly lead to essentially new results, as was the case
with Maxwell’s theory.

Instead, we shall admit another provisional consideration that is more rudi-
mentary, but nevertheless plausible. The Lorentz transformation proves to be
valid both for ﬁeld theoretical and quantum mechanical phenomena. Granting
this, the Lorentz transformation gives evidence of some important property of the
geometry of space. In an arbitrarily curved space, a transformation of that kind,
still anchored in Cartesian coordinates, makes no sense. Indeed, one could apply
local Lorentz transformations but not universal ones, valid over all space. The
mere fact of the existence of the Lorentz transformation seems to prove that the
geometry could not strongly deviate from the Euclidean — that the inﬂuence of
the curvature has only a secondary effect, but does not come into question in ﬁrst

12

(9)

(9a)

approximation.

In reality, however, this is not the case. There is a Riemannian geometry to
be considered as an immediate generalization of the Euclidean, which admits the
Lorentz transformation just as the other. The line element of this geometry differs
from the Euclidean one only by a common factor. We consider thus a geometry
with the following structure:

ds2 = σ(dx2 + dy2 + dz2 + i2c2dt2)

or in a more condensed form:

ds2 = σ

dx2
i .

X

One is accustomed to saying: a geometry of this kind can be “conformally”
mapped onto the Euclidean. The factor σ that we shall for brevity call “metric
factor” may be an arbitrary function of position (of the four coordinates).6

Every covariant equation in this geometry has an a priori structure that can also
be interpreted as “pure Euclidean,” and is thus also consistent with the Lorentz
transformation, though σ may vary to any degree, and with it the geometry may
even become approximately non-Euclidean. Of course, the function σ will also
occur in the equations. It is to be treated as a scalar under Lorentz transformation.

Our equations (6) and (6a), respectively, which presuppose an Euclidean met-
ric, may easily be put in a generally covariant form, thereby rendering them
compatible with a Riemannian basis ﬁeld with arbitrary curvature. Let us take
the geometry (9) as a basis. It turns out that the system (6B) that couples ﬁeld
intensity and vector potential remains unchanged. In system (6A), however, the
factor of measure σ appears where we need it: in the mass term. When compared
to the former case, the difference is only that in place of the constant α2 now α2σ
is to be put on the right-hand side of system (6A).

In this way, we get a new possibility to introduce the mass term in the equations.
Let us imagine we have set up our equations not with the very large constant α2
but with a very small one, which we shall denote by k, the value of which is still
unknown. Furthermore, we shall consider the geometry modiﬁed in this speciﬁed
It then happens that at larger distances, where the metric is practically
way.
Euclidean and the metric factor σ drops to 1, the equations of the theory of
electrons in vacuum turn out only slightly modiﬁed.
In the central region of
the electron, however, where a large amount of electric and mechanic energy is

6This factor somewhat reminds us of the “gauge factor” of Weyl’s theory but has a completely

different sense because here we remain entirely within the framework of Riemannian geometry.

accumulated, the space will curve to such an extent that σ reaches a very high
value, whereby the term kσ becomes very large, on the average comparable to the
former α2 in Dirac’s theory).7

Is what we now have achieved to be regarded only as a formal improvement or
is it also a deepening of the theory of electrons? May we hope to get nearer to the
theory of matter in this way? It would be possible if we succeeded in constructing
a formation from our ﬁeld equations which would represent the electron.

Apparently, the de Broglie’s “phase waves” to which Dirac’s theory is ﬁtted,
are scarcely suitable for giving a ﬁeld theoretical representation of the electron.
They describe oscillations in time, while there is scarcely any doubt that a really
satisfactory ﬁeld theory can be constructed only statically, in face of the high
stability the electron shows externally.

Do our ﬁeld equations possess static solutions? What is more, are they ev-
erywhere regular solutions, in the sense of Schr¨odinger’s “eigenvalue physics,”
because only solutions of that kind could be seriously considered? There are,
of course, solutions with singularities but were we to permit them, our equations
would not surpass the classical ﬁeld equations in anything and should meet with
the same difﬁculties they do.

thus system (10A) can be put in the form:

In the static case with spherical symmetry, the spatial vector potential must be
= 0. This we realize at once from the equation of continuity. The ﬁeld will be

A
determined by the scalar potential ϕ alone. We have for it the equation:

∆ϕ = kσϕ

(13)

(∆ is the three-dimensional Laplacian operator) .

This equation can under no conditions have non-zero regular solutions, as is
easy to show by an integral conversion, as long as the right-hand side is everywhere
positive. k is a positive constant, as is σ which by its meaning can never be zero or
even have negative values. We must abandon our project, or declare it unworkable
for the time being, until the equations get a more exact formulation, namely, by
completing them with the quadratic terms already mentioned.

It is nevertheless remarkable that the impossibility of static solutions is not
a necessary consequence but only a consequence of the introduction of k as a
positive constant. It would not alter the general characteristics of the system of
equations were k negative and, though the idea is speculative, it seems to me
not without interest to scrutinize this possibility. We should then really have the
textbook example of a consistent ﬁeld theory, capable of producing the electron as
a regular, static formation.

We ought to know, of course, about the ﬁeld dependence of the geometric
function σ. Because of our ignorance, we shall simplify the problem, which is
here possible without drastically changing the general features of the solution.
How it is to be done can be seen in Fig. 1. The dotted curve denotes the suspected
course of the function as a function of the distance r, the only variable of a solution

15

with spherical symmetry. The cornered full curve is the schematic representation8
which has a constant higher value within a certain region (“the electron radius”)
then a sudden drop at the constant value 1 in the external space.

The corresponding curve of the electrostatic potential is given in Fig. 2. In
the external space the classical 1/r law is valid, while in the internal space a
“rounding-off” takes place with a continuous joining also in the tangents.

If we widen the threshold for a given height (i.e., increase the “radius”), we
obtain Fig. 3. Outside, we ﬁnd the law
1/r again; inside, [we ﬁnd] the law
1/r sin(2πr/λ0) with a continuous joining at the boundary which must lie at a
distance of odd multiples of λ0 from the center. The wavelength λ0 may be
calculated from the height of the threshold taken as the constant of Dirac’s theory,
as follows:

consequently:

(15)

Instead of de Broglie’s characteristic frequency, a characteristic wavelength
appears here. The phase wave of de Broglie, assigned to an electron at rest,

consists of oscillations in time with spatially constant amplitude. The case inside
the electron is the reverse: there are spatial vibrations in the spatial distribution
of the potential with amplitudes constant in time. Space and time have, in a way,
interchanged their roles.

The equation being linear, a factor of proportion is left free in the solution, and
that contradicts the deﬁnite value e of the charge. We must recall, however, that in
reality the equation is nonlinear, since σ itself depends on the potential ϕ in a still
unknown way. Should we know this dependence, we could uniquely determine the
height and width of the threshold, as well as the amplitude factor — thus the charge
of the electron. (Or rather 2 solutions ought to exist corresponding to both of the
fundamental formations: the electron and proton.) We consider it as a favorable
indication that in the height and width of the threshold two parameters are at
our disposal, according to the two constants that macroscopically characterize the
electron (and the proton, respectively): charge and mass.

Let us consider a large number of electrons side by side on a plane, and sketch
the behavior of the potential in this case by an inﬁnite “wall” where we let the
charges move. We obtain what can be seen in Fig. 4: a linear rise outside, as in the
classical case, while inside we have periodic vibrations with constant amplitude.

17

If we put this wall in motion with velocity v, we need only apply a simple Lorentz
transformation in order to obtain the change of the potential in the ﬁeld. It follows
for the internal periodic distribution:

If the wall passes over a lattice, the elements of the lattice will be excited to
vibrate with this frequency just as if a light wave would have swept over it with
a corresponding frequency. These elements must therefore emit aether radiation
and give rise to interference.

Equation (17) may also be put in the following form:

q
On the left there is the momentum of a light quantum, on the right the mechanical
momentum of the electron, and we might say that a frequency is assigned to the
moving electron stemming from the momentum relation, while with de Broglie it
stems from the energy relation. Here space and time, in a way, again interchange
their roles.

It is the wavelength experimentally found by Thomson, Davisson and Germer,
Stern, Rupp, etc., in their well-known diffraction experiments.

As suggestive as this deduction may be, it does not stand more severe tests. The
idea is at variance with the usual view. Here we do not have those ghostlike phase
waves — that do not exist physically but are only to be “assigned” to the electron
— which interfere with one another and statistically prescribe the trajectory of the
electron. Here the lattice is excited to emit real γ-rays. This realistic approach is,
however, contradicted by experiment. What we really observe are not γ-rays but
material radiation: deﬂected β-rays.

It is still too early to tackle a problem as deep as the structure of the electron
with these elementary assumptions [Ansätzen]. Nevertheless, I am of the belief
that the investigation outlined above, which reveals formal relations of the Dirac
theory to the equations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, goes beyond the purely formal
to represent something deeper, though by far incomplete, toward an understanding
of the quantum problems and the problem of matter, on a uniﬁed ﬁeld theoretical
basis.

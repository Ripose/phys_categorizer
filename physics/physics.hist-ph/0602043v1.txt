Abstract :The inward bound path of discovery unravelling the mysteries of matter and
the forces that hold it together has culminated at the end of the twentieth century in a
theory of the Fundamental Forces of Nature based on Nonabelian Gauge Fields, called the
Standard Model of High Energy Physics. In this article we trace the historical development
of the ideas and the experimental discoveries on which this theory is based. We also mark
signiﬁcant Indian contributions wherever possible. Finally we have a glimpse at future
developments. An Appendix on more Indian contributions is added at the end.

A disclaimer : This is really a job for a historian of science. The selection of this topic
was not done by me. The topic and the title were given to me. I have reinterpreted the title.
I am not interpreting it in a narrow sense. That would be suicidal and a sure prescription
for turning everybody into my enemy. I have chosen a broad canvas and a broad brush. So,
your portrait may be too small to show here. In any case, this is not a selection committee
and I am not assessing anybody for recruitment or promotion. All that I will try to do is to
give my view of the development of Fundamental Physics in the 20th century and, on the
way, refer to India’s contributions (if any).

Indian Contributions To HEP In The 20th Century

0.1 Scope

The earlier part of the 20th Century was marked by two revolutions that rocked the Foun-
dations of Physics.

1. Quantum Mechanics & 2. Relativity

Quantum Mechanics became the basis for understanding Atoms, and then, coupled with Spe-
cial Relativity, Quantum Mechanics provided the framework for understanding the Atomic
Nucleus and what lies inside.

This inward bound path of discovery unraveling the mysteries of matter and the forces
holding it together – at deeper and ever deeper levels – has culminated, at the end of the
20th century, in the theory of Fundamental Forces based on Nonabelian Gauge Fields, for
which we have given a rather prosaic name :

THE STANDARD MODEL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS

But, this is not the end of the road. More on that, later. Thus, HEP is just the continuation
of the era of discoveries that saw the discovery of the electron, the discovery of radioactivity
and X rays, the discovery of the nucleus and the neutron and the discovery of cosmic rays
and the positron.

These discoveries went hand in hand with the development of Quantum Mechanics, Rel-
ativity and Quantum Field Theory. For, without the conceptual advances made in these
theoretical developments, the above experimental discoveries could not have been assimi-
lated into the framework of Physics.

So, the present-day HEP must be regarded as the successor to Nuclear Physics, which

in turn was the successor to Atomic Physics :

HEP is the front end or cutting edge of the human intellect advancing into the unknown
territory in its inward bound journey. This 100-year-long history must be viewed together,
to get a true picture of HEP. It is within this broad framework that we must place any
particular contribution or the totality of Indian contributions, for a proper perspective.
Viewed in this light, it is perfectly natural to include the great Indian contributions made
in the earlier part of the 20th century. If Bose, Raman & Saha were alive and young today,
they would be doing HEP. So, I start with their contributions . . .

1. M N Saha’s (1923) theory of thermal ionization played a crucial role in the elucida-
tion of stellar spectra and thus was of fundamental importance for the progress of
Astrophysics.
(Saha’s (1936) reinterpretation of Dirac’s quantization condition for
monopoles, in terms of ang. mom. quantization, was very original and its importance
is now recognized.)

2. S N Bose (1924) discovered Quantum Statistics even before the discovery of Quantum
Mechanics by Heisenberg & Schr¨odinger one year later. Logically pursued, Bose’s dis-
covery by itself would have led to Quantum Mechanics. But, History went diﬀerently.
QM was discovered soon (in fact, too soon) and the ﬂood gates were open. This was
unfortunate for India. This may be called MISSED OPPORTUNITY I.

3. C V Raman (1928) discovered the inelastic scattering of photon on bound electrons
and thus took the concept of photon one step higher. Raman eﬀect is a fundamental
experimental discovery that has not been surpassed or even equalled in its importance
and impact even after 70 years by any other experiment done in this country.

4. S.Chandrasekhar (1932) applied relativistic quantum mechanics to the interior of stars.
He calculated the degeneracy pressure (or Pauli pressure) of a relativistic electron gas
and thus initiated our understanding of the gravitational collapse of stars.

5. H.J. Bhabha’s (1935) calculation of e+e− scattering was one of the earliest nontrivial
applications of Dirac equation to a process in which Dirac’s hole theory played a crucial
role. This was done even before a full-ﬂedged Quantum Field Theory existed.

The development of QED is concurrent with the development of QFT, which has been
the basic language of HEP, at least so far. One may think of the history of QED originating
with the concept of the photon. But it was Dirac who laid the foundation for QED. The
work of Bose, Einstein, Dirac and Fermi led to the recognition that there are two types of
ﬁeld quantization.

0.2. HEP BEFORE AND AFTER THE STANDARD MODEL

Modern QED starts with renormalization. By 1950, QED emerges as a covariant, local

and renormalizable QFT. Here one must include S. N. Gupta’s contribution.

S N Gupta (1950) It was S N Gupta (1950) who ﬁrst constructed a manifestly relativistic
formulation of QED. Before him, QED was formulated in coulomb gauge which lacked
manifest relativistic invariance. Gupta showed how to do QED in the covariant Lorentz
gauge in a consistent way using indeﬁnite metric.

The important steps are Pauli’s suggestion of neutrino, Fermi’s construction of his fa-
mous theory (which was the most important step), parity violation discovered by Lee, Yang
and Wu and V-A form of interaction proposed by Sudarshan and Marshak (another impor-
tant Indian contribution). The developments culminated in the universal current x current
form of Feynman and Gell-Mann. Actually the ﬁnal form was nothing but Fermi’s theory,
incorporating 100% parity violation. It is important to note that Fermi himself chose only
the vector form for the weak interaction, based on analogy to electromagnetism. The dis-
covery of maximal parity violation then required an equal mixture of V and A. Therefore
the simple form of the weak interaction written down by Fermi purely on an intuitive basis
in 1934 stood the ground for almost 40 years, until it was replaced by the SM.

Discovery of Asymptotic Freedom of NAGT & Birth of QCD (1973)

Strong interactions proved a harder nut to crack. Going quickly over the early history
starting with Yukawa, let us come to the late ﬁfties and early sixties. Under the deluge of
hundreds of hadrons (or hadronic resonances) that were being discovered almost every week,
QFT was declared dead and an alternative philosophy called S matrix theory was proposed,
its chief proponent being G. F. Chew. Many important ideas were developed under its ban-
ner - dispersion relations, Regge poles, bootstrap, nuclear democracy etc. Ultimately this
proved to be a dead end. And a diﬀerent line of attack spearheaded by Gell-Mann proved
more successful. Starting with SU(3), this led to current algebra, and then to quarks, which
ﬁnally led, via scaling in DIS and asymptotic freedom to QCD. So, back to QFT even for
strong interactions.

However, one must not conclude that S matrix approach was a complete failure. Al-

though it was a failure for hadrons, it is this approach that gave birth to String Theory!

The Bangalore event

Here I want to describe an event that occurred in Bangalore in August, 1961. We were
having our ﬁrst TIFR Summer School in Bangalore. Dalitz and Gell-Mann were the lec-
turers. I was only a student, but people like Bhabha, Menon and S. N. Biswas were also
participants.Gell-Mann lectured on SU(3) and the Eightfold Way-fresh from the anvil, even
before they were published. [This was ﬂavor SU(3)-much before the days of color.] During
one of the lectures, Dalitz questioned him about the triplets. Why is he ignoring them?

0.2. HEP BEFORE AND AFTER THE STANDARD MODEL

7

Gell-Mann hedged and hawed in his characteristic fashion and did not answer the question
inspite of Dalitz’s repeated questions. If Gell-Mann had tried to answer the question, quarks
would have been born in Bangalore in 1961 instead of having to wait for another three years.
If any of the other participants had succeeded answering, we would have got the quarks and
this would have been a major Indian contribution. So, I would call this Missed Opportu-
nity II.

Here we have the Lagrangian density describing the em and weak interactions of the three
quarks u, d, s and the four leptons e, µ, νe, νµ. The existence of these quarks as the con-
stituents of the hadrons had been inferred from hadron spectroscopy through a clever guess.
However nobody knew the form of the strong interaction among the quarks which is re-
sponsible for binding them into hadrons. So, it is left unspeciﬁed. The weak current J −

has been written in term of the Cabibbo-rotated quarks, in order to incorporate the weak

The major events which culminated in the construction of the Standard Model are shown
in this table in chronological order. Using nonabelian gauge theory with Higgs mechanism,
the EW theory was already constructed in 1967, although it attracted the attention of most
theorists only after another 4 years, when it was shown to be renormalizable. The discovery
of asymptotic freedom of NAGT and the birth of QCD in 1973 were the ﬁnal inputs that
led to the full standard model.

On the experimental side, the discovery of scaling in DIS which led to the asymptoti-
cally free QCD and the discovery of the NC which helped to conﬁrm the EW theory can be
regarded as crucial experiments. To this list, one may add the polarized electron deuteron
experiment which showed that SU(2) x U(1) is the correct group for EW theory, the dis-
covery of gluonic jets in e+e− annihilation conﬁrming QCD and the discovery of W and Z
in 1983 that established the EW theory. The experimental discoveries of charm, τ , beauty
and top were also fundamental for the concrete 3-generation SM.

However note the blank after 1973 on the theoretical side. Theoretical physicists have
been working even after 1973 and experiments also are being done. But the tragic fact
is that none of the bright ideas proposed by theorists in the past 27 years has received
any experimental support. On the other side, experiments have only been conﬁrming the
theoretical structure completed in 1973. None of the experiments done since 1975 has made
any independent discovery (except the discovery of neutrino mass).
If this continues for
long, it will be too bad for the future of HEP. I shall come back to this point later.

STANDARD MODEL is the basis of all that is known in HEP. Although it is believed
that SM is only an eﬀective low energy description and it is to be replaced by something
beyond, so far SM has resisted all attempts at overthrowing it. All the precision tests
performed so far are in beautiful agreement with SM. All the experimental signals that
seem to signal its overthrow, disappear in about 6 months – 1 year, except one signal,
namely the signal that NEUTRINO has mass. Neutrino is the only particle, a part of
which (its RH part) has zero quantum number and so it is not acted on by the SM group :
SU (3)
U (1). So, its RH part is absent in SM & as a consequence, the nautural
mass of neutrino within SM is zero. That is why ν having a mass is regarded as a signal
beyond SM.

there, as a major contributor to the construction of the SU (2)
We shall eschew parochialism and include him since he is from the subcontinent.) Let me
give a little bit of my side of the story here. I was aware of the beauty of Yang-Mills (YM)
theory from the time of Sakurai’s famous Annals of Physics paper of 1960 and I realized the
importance of YM theory to weak interaction ever since I listened to Veltman in the Varenna
School in 1964 where he stressed the conservation of weak currents. When Weinberg’s paper
with the quaint title ”A model of Leptons” came out in Physical Review Letters in 1967, I
was immediately convinced that this was the correct theory for weak interactions and began
I still missed the boat completely because I was too muddle-headed and
to work on it.
stupid. Instead of trying to renormalize the divergences away (which we now know to be the
right thing, after t’Hooft showed it in 1971), I was trying to generate the strong interactions

10

Indian Contributions To HEP In The 20th Century

from the divergences. I was too ambitious and missed the real thing.

Mine was a double failure. Since I was very familiar with partons, scaling and the quark-
model sum rules that the DIS structure functions were found to obey, I was fully aware of
the serious problem that was staring at everybody’s face, namely, how to reconcile the free-
quark behavior exhibited by the DIS structure functions with the superstrong interactions
of quarks inside the hadrons. The techniques that were subsequently used to eﬀect the
reconciliation were also known to me. In fact I was giving a series of lectures on Wilson’s
RG ideas and the Callan-Symanzik β function at TIFR, when the preprints of Politzer and
Gross-Wilczek proving asymptolic freedom in YM theory came out.

So, I failed on both fronts : on both the two important ﬁeld-theoretic discoveries of
the latter part of the 20th century - namely renormalizability of YM theory with SSB and
asymptotic freedom of YM theory - both of which being the essential theoretical inputs in
the construction of the SM of HEP. This is MISSED OPPORTUNITY III.

Forgetting about myself, it was a collective failure of the Indian High Energy Physicists.
By that tme we had strong theory groups in the country and we should have made signiﬁcant
contributions in the construction of SM, but we did not. In my opinon, this is a glaring
failure and we cannot forgive ourselves for it.

0.3 Future of HEP

Standard Model is not the end of the story. There are too many loopholes in it. First of all,
there are many interesting questions and unsolved problems within SM :

Higgs and symmetry breaking

QCD and Conﬁnement

Neutrinos and their masses and mixings

•

•

•

CP and its violation

•
The solution of these problems may already take us beyond SM.
However, the biggest loophole in SM is the omission of gravitation, the most important
force of nature. Hence, it is now recognized that quantum gravity (QG) is the next frontier
of HEP, and that the true fundamental scale of physics is the Planck energy 1019 Gev, which
is the scale of QG.

We are now probing the region with energy

103GeV . One can see the vastness of
the domain one has to cover before QG is incorporated into physics. In their attempts to
probe this domain of 103
1019 Gev, theoretical physicists have invented many ideas such
as SUSY, hidden dimensions etc and based on these ideas, they have constructed many
beautiful theories, the best among them being the string theory, which may turn out to be
the correct theory of QG.

0.3. FUTURE OF HEP

11

∼

Especially after the second string revolution of 94-96 that led to breakthroughs such as
Duality linking many string theories, multidimensional branes . . . String Theory ( M The-
ory ?) has become very rich. But, Physics is not theory alone. Even beautiful theories have
to be confronted with experiments and either conﬁrmed or thrown out. Here we encounter
a serious crisis facing HEP. In the next 10-25 years, new accelerator facilities with higher
104 Gev) or the Linear Electron Collider will be built so that
energies such as the LHC (
the prospects for HEP in the immediate future appear to be bright. Beyond that period,
the accelerator route seems to be closed because known acceleration methods cannot take
us beyond about 105 GeV. It is here that one turns to hints of new physics from Cosmology,
Astroparticle Physics and Nonaccelerator particle physics. However, these must be regarded
as only our ﬁrst and preliminary attack on the unknown frontier. These are only hints.
Physicists cannot remain satisﬁed with hints and indirect attacks on the superhigh energy
frontier.
To sum up the situation : There are many interesting fundamental theories taking us to
the Planck scale and even beyond, but unless the experimental barrier is crossed, these will
remain only as Metaphysical Theories. It follows that,

either, new ideas of acceleration have to be discovered,

or, there will be an end to HEP by about 2020 AD.

•

•

Some of the ideas being pursued are laser beat-wave method, plasma wake ﬁeld accel-
erator, laser-driven grating linac, inverse free electron laser, inverse Cerenkov acceleration
etc. What we need, are a hundred crazy ideas. May be, one of them will work!

By an optimistic extrapolation of the growth of accelerator technology in the past 60
years, one can show that 1019 GeV can be reached in the year 2086. (See my Calcutta talks)1
But, this is possible only if newer methods and newer technologies are continuously invented.

Another Way Out

In the past three years, another revolutionary idea is being-tried – namely to bring down
Planck scale from 1019 GeV to 103 GeV. This is the so called TeV scale gravity which uses
large (sub-mm) extra dimensions. (If we cannot go up to the mountain top why not ask the
mountain top to come down?)

This is a very interesting ﬁeld, with a bewildering variety of worlds that theorists can

construct, as a scan of recent hep-net will show.

Is Nature so kind and considerate to us, that it would have brought down the Planck

scale for our sake? Only Future can tell.

But, if this turns out to be correct, then Quantum Gravity and String Theory are not
some distant theories relevant at 1019 GeV, but they are immediately relevant at 103
105
GeV. So, it becomes even more urgent to understand String Theories and assimilate them
into Physics!

Status of HEP in India and Suggestions for the

Future

Theory : There is extensive activity in HEP theory in the country, spread over TIFR, PRL,
IMSc, SINP, IOP, MRI, IISc, Delhi University, Panjab University, BHU, NEHU, Gauhati
University, Hyderabad University, Cochin Univesity, Viswabharati, Calcutta University, Ja-
davpur University, Rajasthan University and a few other centres. Research is done in almost
all the areas in the ﬁeld, as any survey will indicate. Theoretical HEP continues to attract
the best students and as a consequence its future in the country appears bright. However,
it must be mentioned that this important national resource is being underutilized. Well-
trained HEP theorists are ideally suited to teach any of the basic components of Physics
such as QM, Relativity, QFT, Gravitation and Cosmology, Many Body Theory, Statistical
Mechanics, and Advanced Mathematical Physics since all these ingredients go to make up
the present-day HEP Theory. Right now, most of these bright young theoretical physicists
are seeking placement in the Research Institutions. Ways must be found so that a larger
fraction of them can be absorbed in the Universities. Even if just one of them joins each
of the 200 Universities in the country, there will be a qualitative improvement in physics
teaching throughout the country. But, this will not happen unless the young theoreticians
gain a broad perspective and train themselves for teaching-cum research careers. Simulta-
neously, the electronic communication facilities linking the Universities among themselves
and with the Research Institutions must improve. This will solve the frustrating isolation
problem which all the University Departments face.
Experiments:

Many Indian groups from National Laboratories as well as Universities (TIFR, VECC,
IOP, Delhi, Panjab, Jammu and Rajasthan Universities) have been participating in 3 major
international collaboration expts :

L3 expt on e+e− collisions at LEP (CERN)

D zero expt on ¯pp collisions at the Tevatron (Fermilab)

•

•

WA93 & WA 98 expts on heavy-ion collisions at CERN

•
As a result of the above experience, the Indian groups are well poised to take advantage
of the next generation of colliders such as Linear Collider and LHC. Already the Indian
groups have joined the international collaboration in charge of the CMS which will be one
of the 2 detectors at LHC. It is also appropriate to mention here that Indian engineers and
physicists are contributing towards the construction of LHC itself.

Thus, the only experimental program that is pursued in the country is the participa-
tion of Indian groups in international accelerator-based experiments. This is inevitable at
the present stage, because of the nature of present-day HEP experiments that involve ac-
celerators, detectors, experimental groups and ﬁnancial resources that are all gigantic in
magnitude.

While our participation in international collaborations must continue with full vigor, at
the same time, for a balanced growth of experimental HEP, we must have in-house activities
also. Construction of an accelerator in India, in a suitable energy range which may be

STATUS OF HEP IN INDIA AND SUGGESTIONS FOR THE FUTURE

initially 10-20 GeV and its utilization for research as well as student-training will provide
this missing link.

In view of the importance of underground laboratories in ν physics, monopole search,
p decay etc, the closure of the deep mines at KGF is a serious loss. This must be at least
partially made up by the identiﬁcation of some suitable site and we must develop it as an
underground lab for nonaccelerator particle physics.2

Finally, it is becoming increasingly clear that known methods of acceleration cannot
take us beyond tens of TeV. Hence in order to ensure the continuing vigor of HEP in the
21st century, it is absolutely essential to discover new principles of acceleration. Here lies
an opportunity that our country should not miss! I have been repeatedly emphasizing for
the past many years (> 10) that we must form a small group of young people whose mission
shall be to discover new methods of acceleration.3

To sum up, a 4-way program for the future of experimental HEP in this country is

suggested.

1. A vigorous participation of Indian groups in international experiments, accelerator-

based as well as nonaccelerator-based.

2. Construction of an accelerator in this country.

3. Identiﬁcation and development of a suitable underground lab for nonaccelerator par-

ticle physics, especially neutrino physics.

4. A programme for the search for new methods of acceleration that can take HEP beyond

the TeV energies.

2A proposal for the construction of an Indian Neutrino Observatory (INO) is under preparation. Hopefully

this project will be undertaken by a collaboration between various institutions in the country

3IPR is already initiating research in this area and CAT is training young scientists in accelerator tech-

nology through SERC Schools

Inspite of the above list one must admit the remarkable absence of signiﬁcant Indian
contributions in the recent history of HEP. Why have we come down? Where are the
equivalents of Bose and Raman in present-day HEP ? There may be sociological reasons for
this, but this is not the place to go into them.

Is it possible that India throws up great names only when physics goes through revo-
lutionary development as in the beginning of the 20th century? If so, the next revolution
which may come in the 21st Century must be eagerly watched! Remember that the solution
of the Quantum Gravity problem and/or the formulation of String Theory is still incom-
plete. That may usher in the next revolution in Physics and may involve great contributions
from India. There are already signs of this, in the quality of Indian contributions to String
Theory and Quantum Gravity. I will close with this optimistic remark.

Abstract

After a quick historical account of the introduction of the group-theoretical
description of Quantum Mechanics in terms of symmetries, as proposed by
Weyl, we examine some unpublished papers by Ettore Majorana. Remarkable
results achieved by him in frontier research topics as well as in physics teaching
point out that the Italian physicist can be well considered as a follower of Weyl
in his reformulation of Quantum Mechanics.

Keywords: Majorana and Quantum Mechanics, Weyl reformulation of Quantum
Mechanics, Group Theory and Quantum Mechanics, Symmetries in Physics

1 INTRODUCTION

The important role of symmetries (and, then, of Group Theory) in Quantum Me-
chanics was established in the third decade of the XX century, when it was discovered
the special relationships concerning systems of identical particles, reﬂection and ro-
tational symmetry or translation invariance.
In particular it was realized that a
given symmetry of (the Hamiltonian of) a physical system leads to the partition of
its states into terms of diﬀerent symmetrical behavior of their eigenfunctions and
then to selection rules. The systematic theory of symmetry resulted to be just a
part of the mathematical theory of groups (see, for example, [1]).

In many cases the dependence of the eigenfunctions on the variables involved in
the symmetry is explicit, and thus the partitions into systems of diﬀerent symmetry
is straightforward. However, this method fails if the number of variables is large. An
alternative approach is to characterize the behavior of the eigenfunctions by means
of transformation matrices; for example, for a rotation along a given axis of an angle
α, the corresponding matrix is:

cos α − sin α
sin α

cos α !

.

 

(1)

Matrices of this kind corresponding to a given group of transformations form the
“representation of the group by means of linear transformations”, and the sets of
terms in the partitions correspond to the “irreducible” representations of the group
of the covering operations of the given physical system. This form of Group Theory
was ﬁrst applied to the quantum theory by E. Wigner in 1926-1927 [2]. The inclusion
of the spin (and other internal symmetries) into the game was, then, possible when
H. Weyl discovered the two-valued representations of the rotation group [1] and used
them to describe the atomic states with spin.

The ﬁnal form of such applications of Group Theory to Quantum Mechanics
was established in the books by Weyl [1], Wigner [3] and van der Waerden [4].
Nevertheless, despite these successes, the group-theoretical description of Quantum
Mechanics in terms of symmetries was ignored by almost all theoretical physicists
and it received attention by physics textbooks only in recent times. It is also notice-
able that, although in the 1950’s almost every physicist had a copy of the Weyl book
[5], the extensive use of Group Theory in physics research started only in nuclear
and particle physics in 1950’s.

Such an indiﬀerence, however, does not apply to Ettore Majorana. Although he
was in Germany for a short period [6], he never met Weyl, but the brilliant works on
Group Theory and its applications of this mathematician, as well as those of Wigner,
left an unambiguous and fruitful mark on the work of the Italian physicist. This
is not easily recognizable by looking at the very few published papers by Majorana
(just 9 diﬀerent articles, one of which posthumous) but clearly emerges from his
unpublished manuscripts (see also the comment of N. Cabibbo in [7]), most of which
are deposited at the Domus Galilaeana in Pisa (Italy) [6].

Majorana was introduced to Physics at the beginning of 1928 by E. Segr´e, and
graduated with Fermi on July 6, 1929. He thus went on to collaborate with the
famous group in Rome created by Enrico Fermi and Franco Rasetti. During 1933
Majorana spent about six months in Leipzig with W. Heisenberg, and then, for some

1

unknown reasons, stopped participating in the activities of Fermi’s group. He even
ceased publishing the results of his research, except for his paper on the “symmetric
theory of electrons and positrons” [8], which (ready since 1933) Majorana was per-
suaded by his colleagues to remove from a drawer and publish just prior to the 1937
Italian national competition for full-professorships. With respect to the last point, it
is remarkable that, on the recommendation of the judging committee (Fermi being
one of the members), the Italian Minister of National Education installed Majo-
rana as professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Naples because of his
“great and well-deserved fame”, independently of the competition itself [6]. Fermi
was, probably, the only great physicist of that time that adequately recognized the
genius of Majorana, as can be deduced from his own words: “Because, you see, in
the world there are various categories of scientists: people of a secondary or ter-
tiary standing, who do their best but do not go very far. There are also those of
high standing, who come to discoveries of great importance, fundamental for the
development of science. But then there are geniuses like Galileo and Newton. Well,
Ettore was one of them. Majorana had what no one else in the world had...” [9].
Unfortunately, Ettore Majorana disappeared during rather mysteriously on March
26, 1938, and was never seen again.

We have analyzed the physics work by Majorana before and after the appearance
of the Weyl’s book, and the results of this research are presented here. We ﬁnd that
Majorana can be well considered as a faithful follower (and, probably, the only one)
of the Weyl thought who, however, went beyond the track drawn by Weyl himself.
In the next section we outline the Weyl proposal for an adequate description of
Quantum Mechanics in terms of Group Theory and discuss the results reached by
the author himself.
Instead in Sect. 3 we consider the work of Majorana in the
direction tracked by Weyl, while in the subsequent section we compare the two
approaches and the corresponding results obtained. Finally in Sec. 5 we give our
conclusions.

2 WEYL PROPOSAL

According to Wigner [3], it was probably M. von Laue who ﬁrst recognized the signif-
icance of Group Theory as the natural tool with which to obtain a ﬁrst orientation in
problems of Quantum Mechanics. However, the program for a description of Quan-
tum Mechanics in terms of Group Theory is clearly stated for the ﬁrst time by Weyl
in the introduction of his well-known book [1]:

“...it has recently been recognized that Group Theory is of fundamental
importance for quantum physics; it here reveals the essential features
which are not contingent on a special form of the dynamical laws nor
on special assumptions concerning the forces involved. We may well
expect that it is just this part of quantum physics which is most certain
of a lasting place. Two groups, the group of rotations in 3-dimensional
space and the permutation group, play here the principal role... The
investigation of groups ﬁrst becomes a connected and complete theory in

2

the theory of the representations of groups by linear transformations, and
it is exactly this mathematically most important part which is necessary
for an adequate description of the quantum mechanical relations...”

As an illustration, let us consider the problem of the splitting of the spectral lines of
an atom, placed in a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld B in the direction of the z axis: for
simplicity we neglect the spin interaction with the magnetic ﬁeld (Zeeman eﬀect).
The non group-theoretical description of the phenomenon proceeds as follows. Let
us consider, at ﬁrst, one-electron atoms; the Hamiltonian describing the system is
then:

H = H0 + W = H0 + µBBLz,

(2)

where H0 is the undisturbed Hamiltonian of the electron and the second term W ac-
counts for the “perturbation” introduced by the magnetic ﬁeld. Here µB = e¯h/2mc
is the Bohr magneton for the electron and Lz is the z component of the angular mo-
mentum operator divided by ¯h. The energy eigenfunctions of the system coincide
with the eigenstates ψm of the operator Lz, whose eigenvalues are the integers m.
Thus the energy terms results to be E = E0 + µBBm, and the frequencies ω of the
spectral lines corresponding to the transition E → E′ are given by:

¯hω = E − E′ = (E0 − E′

0) + µBB(m − m′).

(3)

Each spectral line is, then, broken up into the lines associated with all possible
transitions m → m′. Since m may assume the 2ℓ + 1 values between −ℓ and
+ℓ, the integer ℓ being the orbital quantum number associated to the eigenvalues
of the L2 angular momentum operator, in general we can expect a splitting into
(2ℓ + 1)(2ℓ′ + 1) lines. Nevertheless the transition probabilities are proportional
to the squared modulus of the matrix elements of the components qx, qy, qz of the
dipole moment of the atom along the coordinate axes, given by:

(qx + iqy)m′m =

m′ (qx + iqy) ψm d3~r,
ψ∗

(qx − iqy)m′m =

m′ (qx − iqy) ψm d3~r,
ψ∗

(qz)m′m =

m′qzψm d3~r.
ψ∗

(6)

By expressing the integrand functions in polar coordinates (r, θ, φ), we see that the
one in (qx + iqy)m′m contains the factor exp {i(−m′ + 1 + m)φ} which, integrated
with respect to φ, gives zero unless m′ = m + 1. Similarly, for the second and third
integrand we have m′ = m − 1 and m′ = m, respectively. We thus ﬁnd a splitting
into only three lines, corresponding to the selection rules ∆m = m′ − m = 0, ±1, as
observed experimentally in the normal Zeeman eﬀect.

The group-theoretical description of the same phenomenon does not need the
previous simpliﬁcation of one-electron atoms, but considers the system as a whole
without resolving it into individual electrons. This is justiﬁed by the Wigner ob-
servation in 1927 that it is always possible to choose the eigenfunctions ψm of the
unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 in such a way that a rotation over an angle φ about
the z axis transforms ψm into exp {−imφ} ψm, with integer m. Given the rotational
invariance and that Lz is the inﬁnitesimal generator of rotations about the z axis,

3

we then have, once more, Lzψm = mψm, so that Eq. (3) again follows from Eq. (2).
As far as the transition probabilities are concerned, we note that the component
qz has to remain unchanged when a rotation over an angle φ about the z axis is
performed, so that (qz)m′m must be diagonal. On the other hand, the quantities
qx ± iqy acquire a factor exp {∓iφ} when a rotation is performed, while ψ∗
m′ and ψm
account for a global factor of exp {i(m′ − m)φ}. From rotational invariance, then,
the selection rules immediately follow:

(qx + iqy)m′m :
(qx − iqy)m′m :
(qz)m′m :

∆m = +1,
∆m = −1,
∆m = 0.

(9)

When the spin interaction with the magnetic ﬁeld is taken into account, the anoma-
lous Zeeman eﬀect arises, whose explanation requires to change the perturbation
term W in the Hamiltonian (2) and the formalism of relativistic Quantum Mechan-
ics should be used. Nevertheless the selection rules for the quantum number m
established above have been obtained from fundamental concepts of Group Theory,
so that they are valid in all cases of the Zeeman eﬀect. It is then possible to deal
with the splitting of the spectral lines occurring when the symmetry is decreased;
in the case considered above, we have the transition from the spherical symmetry of
the undisturbed H0 to the axial symmetry of the perturbed H. In particular, Weyl
recognized (see, for example, Sect. A of Chapter IV in [1]) that the breaking up of
the energy levels, due to the axially symmetric perturbation, parallels the reduction
of irreducible representations of the rotation group, when this is restricted to the
group of rotations about the z axis. The problem considered above is, then, a typical
example which well illustrates the above-quoted Weyl proposal.

The Weyl book [1] is practically a sandwich of mathematical formalism and
physics applications (starting from mathematics); nowadays it can be considered
quite a successful attempt for an “adequate” group-based description of the quantum
mechanical phenomena known at that time. Nevertheless it was readily recognized
a great reluctance among physicists toward accepting the group-theoretical point of
view, they called it the “group pest” (see, for example, the prefaces of Refs. [3] and
[1] in their English translations). Remarkably, in the second edition of his book,
Weyl did not go further in his program but “followed the trend of the times, as
far as justiﬁable, in presenting the group-theoretic portions in as elementary a form
as possible”. However the word “elementary” used by Weyl is of dubious meaning;
indeed, the (assumed) didactic sense of this sentence is contradicted by a careful look
inside the revised book (for another interpretation of the Weyl thought, in terms of
his elementary mathematics, see [10]). After the publication of the second edition of
his book, Weyl abandoned his proposal in order to improve the formulation of Group
Theory and render it a more suitable tool for Theoretical Physics; the “group pest”
was, however, cut out from fundamental physics for many years, until the discovery
of peculiar symmetries in nuclear and particle physics. Furthermore we must wait
up to recent times for group-based descriptions of Quantum Mechanics in physics
textbooks.

Probably the failure of the Weyl program should be looked for in the involved
mathematical presentation of the subject, which seemed too much hard to swallow

4

to the physicists of that time [11]. In this depressing framework it appears even more
relevant the enthusiasm by Majorana for Weyl’s proposal about group-theoretical
foundation of Quantum Mechanics.

3 MAJORANA ON GROUP THEORY AND

ITS APPLICATIONS

Among the very few books owned by E. Majorana (about 15 volumes kept by his
nephew Ettore in Rome) it appears the Weyl one “Gruppentheorie und Quanten-
mechanik” in its ﬁrst German edition (1928). As testiﬁed by the large number
of unpublished manuscript pages (and also some published articles) of the Italian
physicist, the Weyl approach greatly inﬂuenced the scientiﬁc thought and work
of Majorana. Here we focus primarily on his 5 orderly notebooks, known as the
“Volumetti” [12], written between 1927 and 1932. Besides a surprising clarity and
linearity of exposition, two peculiar features of the “Volumetti” are relevant for us:
they are dated by the author himself (each notebook was written during a period
of time of about one year, starting from 1927) and explicit references to the Weyl
book are included 1. These features allow us to reconstruct the line of thinking of
our author. In fact, just by looking at the table of contents of the notebooks (this
table was written down by Majorana himself) we are able to realize the impact of
Weyl’s work.

The ﬁrst two notebooks, whose “closing dates” correspond to March 1927 and
April 1928, respectively, deal mainly with electromagnetism, thermodynamics and
atomic physics arguments, accounting for a total of 81 sections, and no reference to
Group Theory or some related application occurs. The situation changes starting
from the third notebook, whose closing date is June 1929: a number of sections are
devoted to the crucial topic under consideration.

In the following we report the list of such sections pertaining to the last three

notebooks (out of a total of 64 sections):

VOLUMETTO III

13. The group of proper unitary transformations in two variables

14. Exchange relations for inﬁnitesimal transformations in the representations of

continuous groups

16. The Group of Rotations O(3)

17. The Lorentz Group

18. Dirac matrices and the Lorentz Group

20. Characters of Dj and reduction of Dj×D′
j
1In about 500 pages, only 5 bibliographical references appears, 3 of which correspond to the

Weyl book of 1928.

5

21. Intensity and selection rules for a central ﬁeld

22. The anomalous Zeeman eﬀect (according to the Dirac theory)

VOLUMETTO IV

7. Fundamental characters of the group of permutations of f objects

14. Cubic symmetry

25. Spherical functions with spin (s=1)

29. Spherical functions with spin (II)

VOLUMETTO V

1. Representations of the Lorentz group

6. Spinor transformations

7. Spherical functions with spin (s=1/2)

8. Inﬁnite-dimensional unitary representations of the Lorentz group

It is remarkable that the above list approximately mimics the sequence of arguments
covered by the Weyl book [1]. Explicit reference to this book appear in Sec. 21 of
Volumetto III; actually, the development of the subject of this section follows closely
that of Sec. 3, chapter 4 of [1] (Intensity and selection rules). Likely as previous
sections, it reiterates Weyl’s arguments, but the last section of the notebooks dealing
with group-theoretical applications (last entry in the above list) is a preliminary
study of what will be one of the most important (published) papers by Majorana
on a generalization of the Dirac equation to particles with arbitrary spin [13]. We
will get an insight into this and other subject in the following section.

4 CONFRONTING MAJORANA WITH THE

WEYL APPROACH

Here we now compare the results achieved by the two authors on some relevant
speciﬁc topics of Group Theory and its applications to Quantum mechanics.

6

4.1 Group Theory

As a starting point let us consider the discussion of the group of unitary transfor-
mations in two dimensions. Weyl approach is typical of a mathematical physicist:
he gives an abstract description of the above-mentioned group as a subgroup of the
group of linear transformations:

x → x′ = αx + βy,
y → y′ = −β∗x + α∗y,

with αα∗ + ββ∗ = 1. Since α and β are, in general, complex numbers, Weyl char-
acterizes the transformations of the group by means of 4 real parameters (real and
imaginary parts of α and β) the sum of whose squares is 1. By using this representa-
tion, he then points out (without an explicit proof) that the composition of two such
transformations corresponds to the multiplication rule for Hamilton quaternions.

Instead, in the Volumetti, Majorana gives a very detailed description of the group
considered, reporting a simple proof of the above-mentioned relationship with the
quaternions. He writes the transformation in Eq. (10) in matrix form:

x′
y′

=

 

!

 

k + i λ − µ + i ν
µ + i ν

k − i λ !  

x
y !

,

where k, λ, µ, ν are 4 real parameters (in practice, according to Weyl, the real and
imaginary parts of the complex numbers α and β above). The composition of two
unitary transformations TA · TB is then described by matrix multiplication AB:

A =

k + i λ − µ + i ν
µ + i ν

k − i λ !

 

, B =

k′ + i λ′ − µ′ + i ν′
µ′ + i ν′

k′ − i λ′

,

!

 

so that the correspondence with the multiplication rule for quaternions immediately
follows:

A B =

 

k′′ + i λ′′ − µ′′ + i ν′′
µ′′ + i ν′′

k′′ − i λ′′

,

!

k′′ = kk′ − λλ′ − µµ′ − νν′,
λ′′ = kλ′ + λk′ − µν′ + νµ′,
µ′′ = kµ′ + λν′ + µk′ − νλ′,
ν′′ = kν′ − λµ′ + µλ′ + νk′.

A general derivation of the generators of the group is reported in the Volumetti
as well. Moreover, keeping in mind physical applications, Majorana also gives ex-
plicit expressions for matrix representations corresponding to the index (angular
momentum) j = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2 (even in modern texts, only j = 0 and j = 1/2
representations are reported).

Similar considerations hold for the study of both the group of rotations and the

Lorentz group.

Instead, for what concerns the group of permutations, relevant for applications to
a system of identical particles, Majorana completes and generalizes the analysis by
Weyl, by giving the explicit expressions for the fundamental characters of the group.
He also discusses cubic symmetry, not considered in [1], by considering the group

7

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

of permutations of 4 objects, and its relationship with the 24 (proper) rotations
transforming the x, y, z axes into themselves.

4.2 Applications to Quantum Mechanics

Several applications of Group Theory to quantum mechanical phenomena are con-
sidered by Weyl as well as Majorana. We have already pointed out in Sec. 3 that
the question of selection rules for atomic transitions in a central ﬁeld is tackled in
the same way by the two authors, with quite similar results. Here we focus on
another typical problem of atomic physics, namely that of the anomalous Zeeman
eﬀect, that Weyl considers as a “simple” application of the theory of the group of
rotations. He evaluates the Land´e g-factor (for one-electron as well as many-electron
atoms) entering in the anomalous splitting of the spectral lines just as the result
of the mean expectation values of some angular momentum operators (adopting a
“physical language”, according to Weyl himself), showing the power of the group-
theoretical methods (but even its uncomfortable use for physicists). On the contrary
Majorana deals with the problem as with an exercise of physics, starting from the
Dirac equation for the physical system considered. The appropriate Hamiltonian
matrix describing the system is, then, deduced and the energy eigenvalues are ob-
tained with the help of Group Theory (following the Weyl method). Majorana
reports detailed predictions of the physical results for the energy eigenvalues in the
weak ﬁeld limit as well as for strong magnetic ﬁelds and, moreover, he considers the
transition from the anomalous Zeeman eﬀect to the Paschen-Back eﬀect by changing
the size of the magnetic ﬁeld acting on the atom. His results for the shift of the
spectral lines are sketched in Figure 1. It appears, by looking at the notebooks, that
such transition is studied only on qualitative grounds; nevertheless some details in
Sec. 22 of Volumetto III seem to suggest some speciﬁc calculations which, to our
knowledge, cannot be performed by using perturbation theory but only numerically.

4.3 Representations of the Lorentz Group

In [1] Weyl supposed that the general properties of ﬁnite-dimensional groups are
preserved in when passing to inﬁnite-dimensional ones. Majorana, instead, explored
such a connection in a diﬀerent way, and this is particularly evident in his treat-
ment of the Lorentz group. This group underlies the Theory of Relativity and its
representations are especially relevant for the Dirac equation in Relativistic Quan-
tum Mechanics. In the Weyl book only a particular kind of such representations
are considered (those related to the two-dimensional representations of the group
of rotations, according to Pauli), but we must observe that an exhaustive study of
this subject was still lacking at that time. The correspondence between the Dirac
equation and the Lorentz transformations is obviously pointed out but, surprisingly,
the group properties of this connection are not highlighted.

parameterizing the perturbation on the system induced by the applied magnetic
ﬁeld. On the left axis the energy (in arbitrary units) of the spectral lines is reported
while, on the right, the spin up or spin down component of the given line in the
Paschen-Back eﬀect is indicated.

9

Majorana treats the Lorentz group in his third and ﬁfth notebook. Conﬁning
ourselves to the same topics covered also by Weyl, again he gives a detailed deduction
of the relationship between the representations of the Lorentz group and the matrices
of the (special) unitary group in two dimensions, and a strict connection with the
Dirac equation is always taken into account. Moreover the explicit form of the
transformations of every bilinear in the spinor ﬁeld Ψ is reported. For example,
he obtains that some of such bilinears behave as the 4-position vector (ct, x, y, z)
or as the components of the rank-2 electromagnetic tensor (E, H) under Lorentz
transformations, according to the following rules:

Ψ†Ψ ∼ −iΨ†αxαyαzΨ ∼ ct,
−Ψ†αxΨ ∼ iΨ†αyαzΨ ∼ x,
−Ψ†αyΨ ∼ iΨ†αzαxΨ ∼ y,
−Ψ†αzΨ ∼ iΨ†αxαyΨ ∼ z,
iΨ†βαyΨ ∼ Ey,
iΨ†βαzαxΨ ∼ Hy,
Ψ†βΨ ∼ Ψ†βαxαyαzΨ ∼ 1,

iΨ†βαxΨ ∼ Ex,

iΨ†βαyαzΨ ∼ Hx,

iΨ†βαxαyΨ ∼ Hz,

(14)
(15)

where αx, αy, αz, β are Dirac matrices.

But, probably, the most important result achieved by Majorana on this subject
is his discussion of inﬁnite-dimensional unitary representations of the Lorentz
group, giving also an explicit form for them. Note that such representations were
independently discovered by Wigner in 1939 and 1948 [14] and were thoroughly
studied only in the years 1948-1958 [15]. Lucky enough, we are able to reconstruct
the reasoning which led Majorana to discuss the inﬁnite-dimensional representations.
In Sec. 8 of Volumetto V we read:

“The representations of the Lorentz group are, except for the identity
representation, essentially not unitary, i.e., they cannot be converted
into unitary representations by some transformation. The reason for
this is that the Lorentz group is an open group. However, in contrast
to what happens for closed groups, open groups may have irreducible
representations (even unitary) in inﬁnite dimensions. In what follows, we
shall give two classes of such representations for the Lorentz group, each
of them composed of a continuous inﬁnity of unitary representations.”

The two classes of representations correspond to integer and half-integer values for
the representation index j (angular momentum). Majorana begins by noting that
the group of the real Lorentz transformations acting on the variables ct, x, y, z can be
constructed from the inﬁnitesimal transformations associated to the matrices (not

from which he deduces the general commutation relations satisﬁed by the S and T
operators acting on generic (even inﬁnite) tensors or spinors:

Next he introduces the matrices

ax = i Sx,

bx = −i Tx,

etc.

(23)

which are Hermitian for unitary representations (and viceversa), and obey the fol-
lowing commutation relations:

Sx Sy − Sy Sx = Sz,
Tx Ty − Ty Tx = − Sz,
Sx Tx − Tx Sx = 0,
Sx Ty − Ty Sx = Tz,
Sx Tz − Tz Sx = − Ty,
etc.

[ax, ay] = i az,
[bx, by] = −i az,
[ax, bx] = 0,
[ax, by] = i bz,
[bx, ay] = i bz,

etc.

(22)

(24)

By using only these relations he then obtains (algebraically 2) the explicit expressions
of the matrix elements for given j and m [12] [13]. The non-zero elements of the
inﬁnite matrices a and b, whose diagonal elements are labelled by j and m, are as
follows:

< j, m | ax − iay | j, m + 1 > =

2The algebraic method to obtain the matrix elements in Eq. (25) follows closely the analo-
gous one for evaluating eigenvalues and normalization factors for angular momentum operators,
discovered by Born, Heisenberg and Jordan in 1926 and reported in every textbook on Quantum
Mechanics (see, for example, [16]).

The quantities on which a and b act are inﬁnite tensors or spinors (for integer or
half-integer j, respectively) in the given representation, so that Majorana eﬀectively
constructs, for the ﬁrst time, inﬁnite-dimensional representations of the Lorentz
group. In [13] the author also picks out a physical realization for the matrices a
and b for Dirac particles with energy operator H, momentum operator p and spin
operator σ:

ax =

where αx, αy, αz are the Dirac α-matrices.

Further development of this material then brought Majorana to obtain a rela-
tivistic equation for a wave-function ψ with inﬁnite components, able to describe
particles with arbitrary spin (the result was published in 1932 [13]). By starting
from the following variational principle:

(27),
By requiring the relativistic invariance of the variational principle in Eq.
Majorana deduces both the transformation law for ψ under an (inﬁnitesimal) Lorentz
transformation and the explicit expressions for the matrices α, β. In particular, the
transformation law for ψ is obtained directly from the corresponding ones for the
variables ct, x, y, z by means of the matrices a and b in the representation (26). By
using the same procedure leading to the matrix elements in (25), Majorana gets the
following expressions for the elements of the (inﬁnite) Dirac α and β matrices:

< j, m | αx − iαy | j + 1, m + 1 > = − 1/2

< j, m | αx − iαy | j − 1, m + 1 > = − 1/2

The Majorana equation for particles with arbitrary spin has, then, the same form
of the Dirac equation:

but with diﬀerent (and inﬁnite) matrices α and β, whose elements are given in Eqs.
(28). The rest energy of the particles thus described has the form:

and depends on the spin s of the particle. We here stress that the scientiﬁc com-
munity of that time was convinced that only equations of motion for spin 0 (Klein-
Gordon equation) and spin 1/2 (Dirac equation) particles could be written down.
The importance of the Majorana work was ﬁrst realized by van der Waerden [17]
but, unfortunately, the paper remained unnoticed until recent times.

FINAL RESULTS

As emerged from the above, when Majorana became aware of the great relevance of
the Weyl’s application of the Group Theory to Quantum Mechanics, he immediately
grabbed the Weyl method and developed it in many applications. What outlined in
the previous sections gives account of only a partial look of the question involving the
adoption and application of the new method, that arose just after the appearance
of the Weyl book. There is no trace of further work in this direction by Weyl after
1928-1931, as discussed in Sec. 2, while Majorana continued to use Group Theory
in his scientiﬁc work (see Secs. 3 and 4) till up 1938 when he lectured on this
subject. Indeed the Weyl proposal for a “novel” description of Quantum Mechanics
was completely adopted by Majorana, who applied it in his lectures on Theoretical
Physics at the University of Naples (January - March 1938). In these lectures [7] he
followed Weyl in “sandwiching” mathematical formalism with physics applications
but, diﬀerently from the author of Gruppentheorie und Quantenmechanik, he started
from physics rather than mathematics, and the physical viewpoint was underlying
throughout the lectures.

We ﬁnish by reporting some passages from the starting lecture held in Naples
by Majorana, revealing an attitude which, some decades after the appearance of the
Weyl proposal, became the usual one for authors dealing with Quantum Mechanics:

“ In order to illustrate Quantum Mechanics in its present form, two
nearly opposite methods could apply. The ﬁrst one is the so-called his-
torical method..., the other is the mathematical one... Both methods, if
applied in an exclusive way, present very serious problems...

Then, if we simply illustrate the theory according to its historical ap-
pearance, we at ﬁrst would make the listener feel ill-at-ease or create
suspicion... that nowadays is no longer justiﬁed. The second method...
does not at all allow to understand the genesis of the formalism... and,
above all, it completely disappoints the desire of guessing its physical
meaning in some manner.

The only way which can be followed..., without leaving oﬀ anything of the
historical genesis of the ideas or the language itself which at the moment
dominate, is to put before an as wide and clear as possible exposition of
the essential mathematical tools...

Our only ambition will be to illustrate as clearly as possible the eﬀective
use of these tools made by physicist in over a decade, in which use - that
never led to diﬃculties or ambiguities - is the source of their certainty.”

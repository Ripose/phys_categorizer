Foreword. This fundamental memoir contains the ORIGINAL form of the solution of Schwarzschild’s problem.
It is regular in the whole space-time, with the only exception of the origin of the spatial co-ordinates; consequently,
it leaves no room for the science ﬁction of the black holes. (In the centuries of the decline of the Roman Empire

people said: “Graecum est, non legitur”...).

1. In his work on the motion of the perihelion of Mercury (see Sitzungsberichte of November
§

18th, 1915) Mr. Einstein has posed the following problem:
Let a point move according to the prescription:

δ

ds = 0,

Z
where

p





ds =

Σgµν dxµdxν µ, ν = 1, 2, 3, 4,

where the gµν stand for functions of the variables x, and in the variation the variables x must be
kept ﬁxed at the beginning and at the end of the path of integration. In short, the point shall move
along a geodesic line in the manifold characterised by the line element ds.

The execution of the variation yields the equations of motion of the point:

and the gαβ stand for the normalised minors associated to gαβ in the determinant

According to Einstein’s theory, this is the motion of a massless point in the gravitational ﬁeld
of a mass at the point x1 = x2 = x3 = 0, if the “components of the gravitational ﬁeld” Γ fulﬁl
everywhere, with the exception of the point x1 = x2 = x3 = 0, the “ﬁeld equations”

is satisﬁed.

The ﬁeld equations together with the equation of the determinant have the fundamental prop-
erty that they preserve their form under the substitution of other arbitrary variables in lieu of x1,
x2, x3, x4, as long as the determinant of the substitution is equal to 1.

Let x1, x2, x3 stand for rectangular co-ordinates, x4 for the time; furthermore, the mass at
the origin shall not change with time, and the motion at inﬁnity shall be rectilinear and uniform.
Then, according to Mr. Einstein’s list, loc. cit. p. 833, the following conditions must be fulﬁlled
too:

1. All the components are independent of the time x4.
2. The equations gρ4 = g4ρ = 0 hold exactly for ρ = 1, 2, 3.
3. The solution is spatially symmetric with respect to the origin of the co-ordinate system in the
sense that one ﬁnds again the same solution when x1, x2, x3 are subjected to an orthogonal
transformation (rotation).

4. The gµν vanish at inﬁnity, with the exception of the following four limits diﬀerent from zero:

g44 = 1, g11 = g22 = g33 =

1.

−

The problem is to ﬁnd out a line element with coeﬃcients such that the ﬁeld equations, the equation
of the determinant and these four requirements are satisﬁed.

2. Mr. Einstein showed that this problem, in ﬁrst approximation, leads to Newton’s law
§
and that the second approximation correctly reproduces the known anomaly in the motion of the
perihelion of Mercury. The following calculation yields the exact solution of the problem. It is
always pleasant to avail of exact solutions of simple form. More importantly, the calculation proves
also the uniqueness of the solution, about which Mr. Einstein’s treatment still left doubt, and
which could have been proved only with great diﬃculty, in the way shown below, through such an
approximation method. The following lines therefore let Mr. Einstein’s result shine with increased
clearness.

3. If one calls t the time, x, y, z, the rectangular co-ordinates, the most general line element
§

that satisﬁes the conditions 1-3 is clearly the following:

ds2 = F dt2

G(dx2 + dy2 + dz2)

H(xdx + ydy + zdz)2

−

−

where F , G, H are functions of r =

x2 + y2 + z2.

The condition (4) requires: for r =
p
When one goes over to polar co-ordinates according to x = r sin ϑ cos φ, y = r sin ϑ sin φ, z =

(6)

Now the volume element in polar co-ordinates is equal to r2 sin ϑdrdϑdφ, the functional determinant
r2 sin ϑ of the old with respect to the new coordinates is diﬀerent from 1; then the ﬁeld equations

−

2

would not remain in unaltered form if one would calculate with these polar co-ordinates, and one
would have to perform a cumbersome transformation. However there is an easy trick to circumvent
this diﬃculty. One puts:

r3
3

x1 =

, x2 =

cos ϑ, x3 = φ.

−
Then we have for the volume element: r2dr sin ϑdϑdφ = dx1dx2dx3. The new variables are then
polar co-ordinates with the determinant 1. They have the evident advantages of polar co-ordinates
for the treatment of the problem, and at the same time, when one includes also t = x4, the ﬁeld
equations and the determinant equation remain in unaltered form.

In the new polar co-ordinates the line element reads:

§

In order to formulate the ﬁeld equations one must ﬁrst form the components of the
gravitational ﬁeld corresponding to the line element (9). This happens in the simplest way when
one builds the diﬀerential equations of the geodesic line by direct execution of the variation, and
reads out the components from these. The diﬀerential equations of the geodesic line for the line
element (9) result from the variation immediately in the form:

Besides these three equations the functions f1, f2, f3 must fulﬁl also the equation of the determinant

As can be easily veriﬁed, the equation (b) is automatically fulﬁlled by the expressions that we found
for f1 and f2.

Therefore all the conditions are satisﬁed apart from the condition of continuity. f1 will be

discontinuous when

In order that this discontinuity coincides with the origin, it must be

1 = α(3x1 + ρ)

ρ = α3.

Therefore the condition of continuity relates in this way the two integration constants ρ and α.

When one introduces these values of the functions f in the expression (9) of the line element
and goes back to the usual polar co-ordinates one gets the line element that forms the exact solution
of Einstein’s problem:

The latter contains only the constant α that depends on the value of the mass at the origin.

5. The uniqueness of the solution resulted spontaneously through the present calculation.
§
From what follows we can see that it would have been diﬃcult to ascertain the uniqueness from
an approximation procedure in the manner of Mr. Einstein. Without the continuity condition it
would have resulted:

(3x1 + ρ)−4/3
α(3x1 + ρ)−1/3 =
When α and ρ are small, the series expansion up to quantities of second order gives:

(r3 + ρ)−4/3
α(r3 + ρ)−1/3 .

r3 (cid:21)

This expression, together with the corresponding expansions of f2, f3, f4, satisﬁes up to the same
accuracy all the conditions of the problem. Within this approximation the condition of continuity
does not introduce anything new, since discontinuities occur spontaneously only in the origin.
Then the two constants α and ρ appear to remain arbitrary, hence the problem would be physically
undetermined. The exact solution teaches that in reality, by extending the approximations, the
discontinuity does not occur at the origin, but at r = (α3
ρ)1/3, and that one must set just ρ = α3
for the discontinuity to go in the origin. With the approximation in powers of α and ρ one should
survey very closely the law of the coeﬃcients in order to recognise the necessity of this link between
α and ρ.

−

6. Finally, one has still to derive the motion of a point in the gravitational ﬁeld, the geodesic
§
line corresponding to the line element (14). From the three facts, that the line element is homoge-
neous in the diﬀerentials and that its coeﬃcients do not depend on t and on φ, with the variation
we get immediately three intermediate integrals. If one also restricts himself to the motion in the
equatorial plane (ϑ = 90o, dϑ = 0) these intermediate integrals read:

If one introduces the notations: c2/h = B, (1

h)/h = 2A, this is identical to Mr. Einstein’s

Actually Mr. Einstein’s approximation for the orbit goes into the exact solution when one

substitutes for r the quantity

(cid:18)

Since α/r is nearly equal to twice the square of the velocity of the planet (with the velocity of light as
unit), for Mercury the parenthesis diﬀers from 1 only for quantities of the order 10−12. Therefore r is
virtually identical to R and Mr. Einstein’s approximation is adequate to the strongest requirements
of the practice.

Finally, the exact form of the third Kepler’s law for circular orbits will be derived. Owing to

(16) and (17), when one sets x = 1/R, for the angular velocity n = dφ/dt it holds

2
n = cx

(1

For circular orbits both dx/dφ and d2x/dφ2 must vanish. Due to (18) this gives:

The deviation of this formula from the third Kepler’s law is totally negligible down to the surface
of the Sun. For an ideal mass point, however, it follows that the angular velocity does not, as with
Newton’s law, grow without limit when the radius of the orbit gets smaller and smaller, but it
approaches a determined limit

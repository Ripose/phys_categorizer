Abstract

We argue that the starting point of Kaluza’s idea of unifying electrodynamics and gravity
was the analogy between gravitation and electromagnetism which was pointed out by Einstein
and Thirring.
It seems that Kaluza’s attention was turned to this point by the three papers
on the Lense-Thirring eﬀect and the analogy between gravitation and electromagnetism which
were published a short time before Kaluza’s paper was submitted. We provide here an English
translation of the third of these papers.

Keywords: History of physics, Uniﬁcation, Higher-dimensional theories.

1 Introduction

In most descriptions of the Kaluza-Klein approach to uniﬁcation [1, 2, 3, 4], Kaluza’s idea [5] (English
translations exist in [6, 7]) to add a ﬁfth dimension to spacetime is considered to be the starting point
for the whole structure.

Most authors also mention the previous ﬁve-dimensional unifying theory by Nordstrom [8] (English
translation in [7]) which was a ﬂat ﬁve-dimensional Maxwell theory with the additional requirement
that all dynamical variables are independent of the ﬁfth coordinate. Nordstrom’s interpretation of the
resulting theory was that of a usual four-dimensional Maxwell system coupled with relativistic scalar
gravity thus obtaining a common source for both kinds of forces.

Since it is generally accepted that Kaluza was unaware of Nordstrom’s theory, Kaluza’s idea is
regarded as a ”quantum leap” with no direct connection to any previous work except, of course, Einstein’s
general relativity. In addition, Weyl’s four-dimensional unifying theory [9] can be considered a source
of the ”spirit of uniﬁcation” of the time.

We wish to suggest a diﬀerent view, viz. that Kaluza’s starting point for his theory was the analogy
between the Maxwell and Einstein equations for ﬁelds of slowly varying sources. This analogy was
pointed out by Thirring (based on earlier work by Einstein [10] - English translation in [11]) during
his work on the Thirring-Lense eﬀect [12, 13] (English translation in [14]). It is explicitly mentioned
(although in a footnote) in the ﬁrst 1918 paper by Thirring [12] and an expanded treatment appears in
a 2-page paper [15] in the same year.

Indeed, Einstein was the ﬁrst, in 1913, to note an electrodynamic-gravitational analogy [10] but it
was based on a tentative version of the gravitational ﬁeld equations. A corrected version which was
consistent with the ﬁnal Einstein equations is Thirring’s 2-page 1918 paper [15]. This is actually the
basis for the gravito-electromagnetism formalism [16, 17] but it is rarely acknowledged as such. Usually,
the other two Thirring & Lense papers (and their translations) are referred to in this context.

These three papers [12, 13, 15] were published slightly before Kaluza prepared a manuscript of
his idea and sent it to Einstein. This must have happened in the ﬁrst third of 1919 as is evident from
Einstein’s ﬁrst very warm reaction in a letter dated 21 April 1919 [18, 2, 3, 4]. Moreover, the 2-page 1918
paper by Thirring is cited by Kaluza in the context of this very same analogy between electrodynamics
and gravity at the beginning of his paper and may be regarded a preparation and motivation for all the
rest.

Therefore, we suggest viewing Kaluza’s work as being based on two main ingredients:
the
electrodynamic-gravitational analogy and the addition of a ﬁfth dimension. Kaluza’s starting point
was the electrodynamic-gravitational analogy for slowly varying sources. Next came the observation
that this is more than an analogy, in that general relativity in some sense contains electromagnetism.
Adding a ﬁfth dimension was only the next step which was unavoidable in order to have enough ”room”
for both ﬁelds within the same theory. Going to ﬁve dimensions was probably an independent contri-
bution of Kaluza; certainly so was his idea to go to ﬁve-dimensional general relativity.

In order to strengthen our suggestion, in the next section we provide an English translation of
Thirring’s 2-page 1918 paper [15] so that non-German speaking readers can judge for themselves. The
last section includes a more detailed discussion about the connection of Thirring’s paper to Kaluza’s.

On the Formal Analogy between the Electromagnetic
Fundamental Equations and the Einsteinian Equations of
Gravity in the First Approximation

by Hans Thirring.

In the following some formal developments will be carried out that in an earlier article 1 only found room
in a footnote. The matter under consideration is the analogy between the Maxwell-Lorentz equations
on one hand, and those equations that determine the motion of a point particle in a weak gravitational
ﬁeld in the ﬁrst approximation, on the other. Einstein himself already referred to this analogy in his
speech at the Wiener Naturforschertag 1913 2∗; however, since his ﬁeld equations have been subject to
quite an important modiﬁcation, it appears not improper to develop the formulas in question for the
ﬁnal version of the theory.

We remark in advance that in the following, we always use a coordinate system where the velocity

of light is 1, and as coordinates we choose:

x1 = x, x2 = y, x3 = z, x4 = it.

We now consider a rather special case of point motion in a quasistationary ﬁeld of gravitation. A
mass point moves in this ﬁeld so slowly that the squares and products of its velocity components are
negligible compared to 1. The gravitational ﬁeld itself is assumed to be weak (such that the deviations
of gµν from the classical values −1 and 0, respectively, can be considered small quantities of ﬁrst order)
and to be generated by incoherent (tensionless) moving masses, the velocities of which are somewhat
larger than that of the point mass under investigation, such that squares and binary products have to
be taken into account. If we denote the velocity of the point mass ~v and those of the ﬁeld generating
masses ~v ′, we thus have to keep expressions of the order of magnitude | ~v |, | ~v ′ |, ~v ′2 and ~v · ~v ′.

As is well known, the equations of motion are

where Tµν denotes the energy tensor, x′, y′, z′ the coordinates of the integration space, R is the distance
from the integration element to position of the point mass, and dV0 the naturally measured volume

Apart from the factor ( dt

ds )2 that only deviates from unity by quantities of order ~v ′2, equations (6a),
(7a) and (2a) only diﬀer from the corresponding electrodynamic equations in the wrong sign on the
right-hand side of (2a) and in the emergence of a factor 4 in (6a). Thus the analog of the magnetic force
in the theory of gravitation is four times larger than in electrodynamics.

To the derivation of this formal analogy, a remark of a principal nature is added. It seems a priori very
unlikely that mathematical laws that in one area of phenomena are approximated formulas for certain
special cases, provide an exact description of the phenomena in another area. Thus, the conjecture
arises (apart from the physical necessity, for formal reasons as well) that the Maxwell-Lorentz equations
are also approximate formulas that, even though they are suﬃciently precise for the ﬁelds generated
electrotechnically, need a corresponding generalization for the far stronger ﬁelds that occur at the
dimensions of atoms and electrons, to which Hilbert and Mie (who have a far more general starting
point) have already provided suggestions.

3 Discussion

First we correct an error which has no eﬀect on the ﬁnal conclusion: In eq. (7) for the Christoﬀel
symbols (see e.g. Wald [20] p. 36), there is a mistake in the last line where the terms − ∂gi4
∂x4 , i = 1, 2, 3,
should be left out. This also means that the third line of (8) should be corrected since the equality
between the Christoﬀel symbols does not hold.

It is obvious that the Thirring paper had a strong inﬂuence on Kaluza. Both papers are limited to the
weak ﬁeld limit, they both use similar methods to isolate and identify the electromagnetic components
and they use an identical matter source - pressureless dust.

Eqs. (7) and (8) could be Kaluza’s starting point. Here Thirring records the gravitational ﬁeld in the
weak-ﬁeld limit according to the ﬁnal version of Einstein’s general theory of relativity of a dust cloud
with slow but otherwise arbitrary motion. It is very likely that Kaluza had these equations (7) and (8)
in mind, when making the conjecture in his paper (second page in both translations or in the original

4

version) that the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength should be ”equal to somehow amputated three-index
symbols”.

There are of course diﬀerences due to the giant (if not ”quantum”) leap Kaluza made. A small
one is the condition |g| = −1 used by Kaluza but not by Thirring. A more signiﬁcant diﬀerence is
that Kaluza’s x5 (actually, he used x0 for the fourth spacelike coordinate and x4 was i×time) takes
the role of time in the Thirring-Lense papers, so the interpretation is, accordingly, diﬀerent. The four-
dimensional analogue of Kaluza’s work is the analysis of the gravitational ﬁeld of a source which has
a weak dependence on one spatial coordinate. The major diﬀerence is, of course, the extra dimension
which Kaluza added. Possibly Kaluza, aware of the ”spirit of uniﬁcation” of the time, realized that the
D = 4 Maxwell-Einstein analogy appearing in the Thirring-Lense papers can be turned into a unifying
scheme if a ﬁfth dimension is added.

Abstract

An account is given of some topical unpublished work by Ettore Majo-
rana, revealing his very deep intuitions and skilfulness in Theoretical
Physics. The relevance of the quite unknown results obtained by him
is pointed out as well.

1 Introduction

Probably, the highest appraisal received by the work of Ettore Majorana
was expressed by the Nobel Prize Enrico Fermi in several occasions [1], but
such opinions could appear as overstatements or unjustiﬁed (especially be-
cause they are expressed by a great physicist as Fermi), when compared with
the spare (known) Majorana’s scientiﬁc production, just 9 published papers.
However, today the name of Majorana is largely known to the nuclear and
subnuclear physicist’s community: Majorana neutrino, Majorana-Heisenberg
exchange forces, and so on are, in fact, widely used concepts.

In this paper, we focus on the less-known (or completely unknown) work
by this scientist, aimed to shed some light on the peculiar abilities of Ma-
jorana that were well recognized by Fermi and his coworkers. The wide
unpublished scientiﬁc production by Majorana is testiﬁed by a large amount
of papers [2], almost all deposited at the Domus Galilaeana in Pisa; those
known, in Italian, as “Volumetti” has been recently collected and translated
in a book [3], and we refer the interested reader to this book for further study.
Here we have chosen to discuss only four topics dealt with by Majorana
in diﬀerent areas of Physics, just to give a sample of his very deep intuitions
and skilfulness, together with the relevance of the results obtained.

1

We start with a discussion of a peculiar approach to Quantum Mechanics,
as deduced by a manuscript [4] which probably corresponds to the text for a
seminar delivered at the University of Naples in 1938, where Majorana lec-
tured on Theoretical Physics [5]. Some passages of that manuscript reveal a
physical interpretation of the Quantum Mechanics, which anticipates of sev-
eral years the Feynman approach in terms of path integrals, independently
of the underlying mathematical formulation. The main topic of that disser-
tation was the application of Quantum Mechanics to the theory of molecular
bonding, but the present scientiﬁc interest in it is more centered on the inter-
pretation given by Majorana about some topics of the novel, for that time,
Quantum Theory (namely, the concept of quantum state) and the direct ap-
plication of this theory to a particular case (that is, precisely, the molecular
bonding). It not only discloses a peculiar cleverness of the author in treating
a pivotal argument of the novel Mechanics, but, keeping in mind that it was
written in 1938, also reveals a net advance of at least ten years in the use
made of that topic.

In the second topic, we report on a more applicative subject, discussing an
original method that leads to a semi-analytical series solution of the Thomas-
Fermi equation, with appropriate boundary conditions, in terms of only one
quadrature [6]. This was developed by Majorana in 1928, just when starting
to collaborate (still as a University student) with the Fermi group in Rome,
and reveals an outstanding ability to solve very involved mathematical prob-
lems in a very interesting and clear way. The whole work performed on the
Thomas-Fermi model is contained in some spare sheets, and diligently re-
ported by the author himself in his notebooks [3]. From these it is evident
the considerable contribution given by Majorana even in the achievement of
the statistical model [7], anticipating, in many respects, some important re-
sults reached later by leading specialists. But the major ﬁnding by Majorana
was his solution (or, rather, methods of solutions) of the Thomas-Fermi equa-
tion, which remained completely unknown, until recent times, to the Physics
community, who ignored that the non-linear diﬀerential equation relevant for
atoms and other systems could even be solved semi-analytically. The method
proposed by Majorana can also be extended to an entire class of particular
diﬀerential equations [8].

Afterwards we discuss a subject that was repeatedly studied by Majorana
in his research notebooks; namely that of a formulation of Electrodynamics in
terms of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, rather than the potentials, which is
suitable for a quantum generalization, in a complete analogy with the Dirac

2

theory [9] [10]. This argument was already faced in 1931 by Oppenheimer
[11], who only supposed the analogy of the photon case with that described by
Dirac, but Majorana explicitly deduced a Dirac-like equation for the photon,
thus building up the presumed analogy.

Finally, we report on another topic particularly loved by Majorana, after
the appearance (at the end of 1928) of the seminal book by Hermann Weyl
[12], that is the Group Theory and its application to physical problem. As
testiﬁed by the large number of unpublished manuscript pages of the Ital-
ian physicist, the Weyl approach greatly inﬂuenced the scientiﬁc thought and
work of Majorana [13]. In fact, when Majorana became aware of the great rel-
evance of the Weyls application of the Group Theory to Quantum Mechanics,
he immediately grabbed the Weyl method and developed it in many applica-
tions. In one of his notebooks [3] we ﬁnd, for example, a preliminary study of
what will be one of the most important (published) papers by Majorana on
a generalization of the Dirac equation to particles with arbitrary spin [14].
In particular, in 1932 Majorana obtained the inﬁnite-dimensional unitary
representations of the Lorentz group that will be re-discovered by Wigner
in his 1939 and 1948 works [15], and the entire theory was re-invented by
Soviet mathematicians (in particular Gel’fand and collaborators) in a series
of articles from 1948 to 1958 [16] and ﬁnally applied by physicists years later.
What presented here is, necessarily, a very short account of what Majo-
rana really did in his few years of work (about ten years), but, we hope, it
serves in the centennial year at least to understand the very relevant role
played by him in the advancement of Physics.

2 Path-Integral approach to Quantum Me-

chanics

The usual quantum-mechanical description of a given system is strongly cen-
tered on the role played by the hamiltonian H of the system and, as a con-
sequence, the time variable plays itself a key role in this description. Such a
dissymmetry between space and time variables is, obviously, not satisfactory
in the light of the postulates of the Theory of Relativity. This was ﬁrstly
realized in 1932 by Dirac [17], who put forward the idea of reformulating the
whole Quantum Mechanics in terms of lagrangians rather than hamiltonians.
The starting point in the Dirac thought is that of exploiting an analogy, hold-

3

ing at the quantum level, with the Hamilton principal function S in Classical
Mechanics, thus writing the transition amplitude from one space-time point
to another as an (imaginary) exponential of S. However, the original Dirac
formulation was not free from some unjustiﬁed assumptions, leading also to
wrong results, and the correct mathematical formulation and the physical
interpretation of it came only in the forties with the work by Feynman [18].
In practice, in the Feynman approach to Quantum Mechanics, the transi-
tion amplitude between an initial and a ﬁnal state can be expressed as a
sum of the factor eiS[q]/¯h over all the paths q with ﬁxed end-points, not just
those corresponding to classical dynamical trajectories, for which the action
is stationary.

In 1938 Majorana was appointed as full professor of Theoretical Physics
at the University of Naples, where probably delivered a general conference
mentioning also his particular viewpoint on some basic concepts on Quantum
Mechanics (see Ref. [4]). Fortunately enough, we have some papers written
by him on this subject, and few crucial points, anticipating the Feynman
approach to Quantum Mechanics, will be discussed in the following. However,
we ﬁrstly note that such papers contain nothing of the mathematical aspect of
that peculiar approach to Quantum Mechanics, but it is quite evident as well
the presence of the physical foundations of it. This is particularly impressive
if we take into account that, in the known historical path, the interpretation
of the formalism has only followed the mathematical development of the
formalism itself.

The starting point in Majorana is to search for a meaningful and clear
formulation of the concept of quantum state. And, obviously, in 1938 the
dispute is opened with the conceptions of the Old Quantum Theory.

According to the Heisenberg theory, a quantum state corresponds
not to a strangely privileged solution of the classical equations but
rather to a set of solutions which diﬀer for the initial conditions
and even for the energy, i.e. what it is meant as precisely deﬁned
energy for the quantum state corresponds to a sort of average
over the inﬁnite classical orbits belonging to that state. Thus
the quantum states come to be the minimal statistical sets of
classical motions, slightly diﬀerent from each other, accessible to
the observations. These minimal statistical sets cannot be fur-
ther partitioned due to the uncertainty principle, introduced by
Heisenberg himself, which forbids the precise simultaneous mea-

4

surement of the position and the velocity of a particle, that is the
determination of its orbit.

Let us note that the “solutions which diﬀer for the initial conditions” corre-
spond, in the Feynman language of 1948, precisely to the diﬀerent integration
paths. In fact, the diﬀerent initial conditions are, in any case, always referred
to the same initial time (ta), while the determined quantum state corresponds
to a ﬁxed end time (tb). The introduced issue of “slightly diﬀerent classical
motions” (the emphasis is given by Majorana himself), according to what
speciﬁed by the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle and mentioned just after-
wards, is thus evidently related to that of the suﬃciently wide integration
region required in the Feynman path-integral formula for quantum (rather
than classical) systems. In this respect, such a mathematical point is inti-
mately related to a fundamental physical principle.

The crucial point in the Feynman formulation of Quantum Mechanics is,
as well-known, to consider not only the paths corresponding to classical tra-
jectories, but all the possible paths joining the initial point with the end one.
In the Majorana manuscript, after a discussion on an interesting example on
the harmonic oscillator, the author points out:

Obviously the correspondence between quantum states and sets
of classical solutions is only approximate, since the equations de-
scribing the quantum dynamics are in general independent of the
corresponding classical equations, but denote a real modiﬁcation
of the mechanical laws, as well as a constraint on the feasibility
of a given observation; however it is better founded than the rep-
resentation of the quantum states in terms of quantized orbits,
and can be usefully employed in qualitative studies.

And, in a later passage, it is more explicitly stated that the wave function
“corresponds in Quantum Mechanics to any possible state of the electron”.
Such a reference, that only superﬁcially could be interpreted, in the common
acceptation, that all the information on the physical systems is contained
in the wave function, should instead be considered in the meaning given by
Feynman, according to the comprehensive discussion made by Majorana on
the concept of state.

Finally we point out that, in the Majorana analysis, a key role is played

by the symmetry properties of the physical system.

5

Under given assumptions, that are veriﬁed in the very simple
problems which we will consider, we can say that every quantum
state possesses all the symmetry properties of the constraints of
the system.

The relationship with the path-integral formulation is made as follows. In
discussing a given atomic system, Majorana points out how from one quan-
tum state S of the system we can obtain another one S′ by means of a
symmetry operation.

However, diﬀerently from what happens in Classical Mechanics
for the single solutions of the dynamical equations, in general it is
no longer true that S′ will be distinct from S. We can realize this
easily by representing S′ with a set of classical solutions, as seen
above; it then suﬃces that S includes, for any given solution,
even the other one obtained from that solution by applying a
symmetry property of the motions of the systems, in order that
S′ results to be identical to S.

This passage is particularly intriguing if we observe that the issue of the
redundant counting in the integration measure in gauge theories, leading to
inﬁnite expressions for the transition amplitudes, was raised (and solved)
only after much time from the Feynman paper.

3 Solution of the Thomas-Fermi equation

The main idea of the Thomas-Fermi atomic model is that of considering
the electrons around the nucleus as a gas of particles, obeying the Pauli
exclusion principle, at the absolute zero of temperature. The limiting case
of the Fermi statistics for strong degeneracy applies to such a gas. Then, in
this approximation, the potential V inside a given atom of charge number Z
at a distance r from the nucleus may be written as

With a suitable change of variable, r = µx and

V (r) =

ϕ(r).

the Thomas-Fermi function ϕ satisﬁes the following non-linear diﬀerential
equation (for ϕ > 0):

(a prime denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to x) with the boundary condi-
tions:

The Fermi equation (3) is a universal equation which does not depend neither
on Z nor on physical constants (¯h, m, e). Its solution gives, from Eq. (1), as
noted by Fermi himself, a screened Coulomb potential which at any point is
equal to that produced by an eﬀective charge

(3) on
As was immediately realized, in force of the independence of Eq.
Z, the method gives an eﬀective potential which can be easily adapted to
describe any atom with a suitable scaling factor, according to Eq. (5).

The problem of the theoretical calculation of observable atomic properties
is thus solved, in the Thomas-Fermi approximation, in terms of the function
ϕ(x) introduced in Eq. (1) and satisfying the Fermi diﬀerential equation (3).
By using standard but involved mathematical tools, in his paper [19] Thomas
got an exact, “singular” solution of his diﬀerential equation satisfying only
the second condition (4). This was later (in 1930) considered by Sommerfeld
[25] as an approximation of the function ϕ(x) for large x (and is indeed known
as the “Sommerfeld solution” of the Fermi equation),

and Sommerfeld himself obtained corrections to the above quantity in order
to approximate in a better way the function ϕ(x) for not extremely large
values of x.

Until recent times it has been believed that the solution of such equation
satisfying both the appropriate boundary conditions in (4) cannot be ex-
pressed in closed form, and some eﬀort has been made, starting from Thomas
[19], Fermi [20], [21] and others, in order to achieve the numerical integration

of the diﬀerential equation. However, we now know [6], [7] that Majorana
in 1927-8 found a semi-analytical solution of the Thomas-Fermi equation by
applying a novel exact method [8]. Before proceeding, we will indulge here
on an anecdote reported by Rasetti [22], Segr`e [23] and Amaldi [24]. Accord-
ing to the last author, “Fermi gave a broad outline of the model and showed
some reprints of his recent works on the subject to Majorana, in particu-
lar the table showing the numerical values of the so-called Fermi universal
potential. Majorana listened with interest and, after having asked for some
explanations, left without giving any indication of his thoughts or intentions.
The next day, towards the end of the morning, he again came into Fermi’s
oﬃce and asked him without more ado to draw him the table which he had
seen for few moments the day before. Holding this table in his hand, he
took from his pocket a piece of paper on which he had worked out a similar
table at home in the last twenty-four hours, transforming, as far as Segr`e
remembers, the second-order Thomas-Fermi non-linear diﬀerential equation
into a Riccati equation, which he had then integrated numerically.”

The whole work performed by Majorana on the solution of the Fermi equa-
tion, is contained in some spare sheets conserved at the Domus Galilaeana
in Pisa, and diligently reported by the author himself in his notebooks [3].
The reduction of the Fermi equation to an Abel equation (rather than a Ric-
cati one, as confused by Segr`e) proceeds as follows. Let’s adopt a change of
variables, from (x, ϕ) to (t, u), where the formula relating the two sets of vari-
ables has to be determined in order to satisfy, if possible, both the boundary
conditions (4). The function ϕ in Eq. (6) has the correct behavior for large
x, but the wrong one near x = 0, so that we could modify the functional
form of ϕ to take into account the ﬁrst condition in (4). An obvious modiﬁ-
cation is ϕ = (144/x3)f (x), with f (x) a suitable function which vanishes for
0 in order to account for ϕ(x = 0) = 1. The simplest choice for f (x)
x
is a polynomial in the novel variable t, as it was also considered later, in a
similar way, by Sommerfeld [25]. The Majorana choice is as follows:

→

ϕ(x) =

x3 (1

t)2,

(7)

→

1 as x

with t
0. From Eq. (7) we can then obtain the ﬁrst relation
linking t to x, ϕ. The second one, involving the dependent variable u, is that
typical of homogeneous diﬀerential equations (like the Fermi equation) for
reducing the order of the equation, i.e. exponentiation with an integral of

Substitution into Eq. (3) leads to an Abel equation for u(t),

Note that both the boundary conditions in (4) are automatically veriﬁed
by the relations (8). We have reported the derivation of the Abel equation
(9) mainly for historical reasons (nevertheless, it is quite important since,
in this way, all the theorems on the Abel equation may thus be applied to
the non-linear Thomas-Fermi equation too); the precise numerical values for
the Fermi function ϕ(x) were obtained by Majorana by solving a diﬀerent
ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation. Instead of Eq. (7), Majorana chooses ϕ(x)
of the form

ϕ(x) =

144
x3 t6.

Now the point with x = 0 corresponds to t = 0. In order to obtain again a
ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation for u(t), the transformation equation for the
variable u involves ϕ and its ﬁrst derivative. Majorana then introduced the
following formulas:

t = 144−1/6 x1/2 ϕ1/6,

By using Eqs. (12) to eliminate x1/2 and ϕ′2, the following equation results:

Now the quantity ˙xϕ1/3 can be expressed in terms of t and u by making use
again of the ﬁrst equation in (12) (and its t-derivative). After some algebra,
the ﬁnal result for the diﬀerential equation for u(t) is:

The obtained equation is again non-linear but, diﬀerently from the original
Fermi equation (3), it is ﬁrst-order in the novel variable t and the degree
of non-linearity is lower than that of Eq. (3). The boundary conditions for
u(t) are easily taken into account from the second equation in (12) and by

Remarkably, the Majorana solution of the Thomas-Fermi equation is ob-
tained with only one quadrature and gives easily obtainable numerical val-
ues for the electrostatic potential inside atoms. By taking into account only
10 terms in the series expansion for u(t), such numerical values approximate
the values of the exact solution of the Thomas-Fermi equation with a relative
error of the order of 0.1%.

The intriguing property in the Majorana derivation of the solution of the
Thomas-Fermi equation is that his method can be easily generalized and may
be applied to a large class of particular diﬀerential equations, as discussed in
[8].

Several generalizations of the Thomas-Fermi method for atoms were pro-
posed as early as in 1928 by Majorana, but they were considered by the
physics community, ignoring the Majorana unpublished works, only many
years later.

Indeed, in Sect. 16 of Volumetto II [3], Majorana studied the problem
of an atom in a weak external electric ﬁeld E, i.e. atomic polarizability,
and obtained an expression for the electric dipole moment for a (neutral or
arbitrarily ionized) atom.

Furthermore, he also started to consider the application of the statistical
method to molecules, rather than single atoms, studying the case of a di-
atomic molecule with identical nuclei (see Sect. 12 of Volumetto II [3]). The
eﬀective potential in the molecule was cast in the form:

V = V1 + V2 −

α

2V1V2
V1 + V2

,

(22)

(23)

V1 and V2 being the potentials generated by each of the two atoms. The
function α must obey the diﬀerential equation for V ,

2V =

kV 3/2

∇

−
(k is a suitable constant), with appropriate boundary conditions, discussed in
[3]. Majorana also gave a general method to determine V when the equipo-
tential surfaces are approximately known (see Sect. 12 of Volumetto III [3]).
In fact, writing the approximate expression for the equipotential surfaces, as
functions of a parameter p, as

f (x, y, z) = p,

(24)

12

he deduced a thorough equation from which it is possible to determine V (ρ),
when the boundary conditions are assigned. The particular case of a di-
atomic molecule with identical nuclei was, again, considered by Majorana
using elliptic coordinates in order to illustrate his original method [3].

Finally, our author also considered the second approximation for the po-
tential inside the atom, beyond the Thomas-Fermi one, with a generalization
of the statistical model of neutral atoms to those ionized n times, including
the case n = 0 (see Sect. 15 of Volumetto II [3]). As recently pointed out, the
approach used by Majorana to this end is rather similar to that now adopted
in the renormalization of physical quantities in modern gauge theories [26].

4 Majorana formulation of Electrodynamics

In 1931, in his “note on light quanta and the electromagnetic ﬁeld” [11], Op-
penheimer developed an alternative model to the theory of Quantum Elec-
trodynamics, starting from an analogy with the Dirac theory of the electron.
Such a formulation was particularly held dear by Majorana, who studied it
in some of his unpublished notebooks [9].

Majorana’s original idea was that if the Maxwell theory of electromag-
netism has to be viewed as the wave mechanics of the photon, then it must
be possible to write the Maxwell equations as a Dirac-like equation for a
probability quantum wave ψ, this wave function being expressible by means
of the physical ~
ﬁelds. This can be, indeed, realized introducing the

It is interesting to observe that, diﬀerently from Oppenheimer, who started
from a mere, presumed analogy with the electron case, Majorana built on
analytically the analogy with the Dirac theory, at a dynamical level, by de-
ducing the Dirac-like equation for the photon from the Maxwell equations
with the introduction of a complex wave ﬁeld. As noted by Giannetto in

Ref. [10], the Majorana formulation is algebraically equivalent to the stan-
dard one of Quantum Electrodynamics and, in addition, also some relevant
problems concerning the negative energy states, that induced Oppenheimer
to abandon his model, may be elegantly solved by using the method envis-
aged in a later work [27], thus giving further physical insight into Majorana
theory.

5 Lorentz group and its applications

The important role of symmetries in Quantum Mechanics was established in
the third decade of the XX century, when it was discovered the special rela-
tionships concerning systems of identical particles, reﬂection and rotational
symmetry or translation invariance. Very soon it was discovered that the
systematic theory of symmetry resulted to be just a part of the mathemat-
ical theory of groups, as pointed out, for example, in the reference book by
H. Weil [12]). A particularly intriguing example is that of the Lorentz group
which, as well known, underlies the Theory of Relativity, and its representa-
tions are especially relevant for the Dirac equation in Relativistic Quantum
Mechanics. In the mentioned book, however, although the correspondence
between the Dirac equation and the Lorentz transformations is pointed out,
the group properties of this connection are not highlighted. Moreover, only
a particular kind of such representations are considered (those related to
the two-dimensional representations of the group of rotations, according to
Pauli), but an exhaustive study of this subject was still lacking at that time.
The situation changes [13] quite sensibly with several (unpublished) pa-
pers by Majorana [3], where he gives a detailed deduction of the relationship
between the representations of the Lorentz group and the matrices of the
(special) unitary group in two dimensions, and a strict connection with the
Dirac equation is always taken into account. Moreover the explicit form of
the transformations of every bilinear in the spinor ﬁeld Ψ is reported. For ex-
ample, Majorana obtains that some of such bilinears behave as the 4-position
vector (ct, x, y, z) or as the components of the rank-2 electromagnetic tensor
(E, H) under Lorentz transformations, according to the following rules:

where αx, αy, αz, β are Dirac matrices.

But, probably, the most important result achieved by Majorana on this
subject is his discussion of inﬁnite-dimensional unitary representations of
the Lorentz group, giving also an explicit form for them. Note that such
representations were independently discovered by Wigner in 1939 and 1948
[15] and were thoroughly studied only in the years 1948-1958 [16]. Lucky
enough, we are able to reconstruct the reasoning which led Majorana to
discuss the inﬁnite-dimensional representations. In Sec. 8 of Volumetto V
we read [3]:

“The representations of the Lorentz group are, except for the
identity representation, essentially not unitary, i.e., they cannot
be converted into unitary representations by some transforma-
tion. The reason for this is that the Lorentz group is an open
group. However, in contrast to what happens for closed groups,
open groups may have irreducible representations (even unitary)
in inﬁnite dimensions. In what follows, we shall give two classes
of such representations for the Lorentz group, each of them com-
posed of a continuous inﬁnity of unitary representations.”

The two classes of representations correspond to integer and half-integer
values for the representation index j (angular momentum). Majorana begins
by noting that the group of the real Lorentz transformations acting on the
variables ct, x, y, z can be constructed from the inﬁnitesimal transformations

The quantities on which a and b act are inﬁnite tensors or spinors (for integer
or half-integer j, respectively) in the given representation, so that Majorana
eﬀectively constructs, for the ﬁrst time, inﬁnite-dimensional representations
of the Lorentz group. In [14] the author also picks out a physical realiza-
tion for the matrices a and b for Dirac particles with energy operator H,
2The algebraic method to obtain the matrix elements in Eq. (40) follows closely the
analogous one for evaluating eigenvalues and normalization factors for angular momentum
operators, discovered by Born, Heisenberg and Jordan in 1926 and reported in every
textbook on Quantum Mechanics (see, for example, [28]).

Further development of this material then brought Majorana to obtain a

By requiring the relativistic invariance of the variational principle in Eq. (42),
Majorana deduces both the transformation law for ψ under an (inﬁnitesimal)
Lorentz transformation and the explicit expressions for the matrices α, β.
In particular, the transformation law for ψ is obtained directly from the
corresponding ones for the variables ct, x, y, z by means of the matrices a
and b in the representation (41). By using the same procedure leading to
the matrix elements in (40), Majorana gets the following expressions for the
elements of the (inﬁnite) Dirac α and β matrices:

The Majorana equation for particles with arbitrary spin has, then, the same
form of the Dirac equation:

but with diﬀerent (and inﬁnite) matrices α and β, whose elements are given
in Eqs. (43). The rest energy of the particles thus described has the form:

and depends on the spin s of the particle. We here stress that the scientiﬁc
community of that time was convinced that only equations of motion for spin
0 (Klein-Gordon equation) and spin 1/2 (Dirac equation) particles could be
written down. The importance of the Majorana work was ﬁrst realized by
van der Waerden [29] but, unfortunately, the paper remained unnoticed until
recent times.

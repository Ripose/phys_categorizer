The Life and Legacy of Pomeranchuk

L.B. OKUN ∗

1 Introduction

The life of Isaak Yakovlevich Pomeranchuk was short (20.05.1913 – 14.12.1966).
But the impact of his personality and his works on physics and physicists is
remarkable.

With better luck he could live today and even participate in this confer-
ence. It is diﬃcult to imagine what would be the theme of his talk. The 36
years without him brought drastic changes in all aspects of life, science in
general and physics in particular. But many of the talks at this conference
have roots in the ideas and the thrust of Pomeranchuk.

All his life he was ready to start a new journey into the world of unknown.
Insatiable scientiﬁc curiosity was one of his

He went on many of them.
dominant passions.

2 On the way to physics

Yuzik Pomeranchuk was born in Warsaw (at that time in Russia) on the eve
of the World War I. His father was a chemical engineer, mother – medical
doctor. In 1918 the family moved to Rostov-on-Don, later, in 1923, – to a
town Rubezhnoe in Donets Basin, where his father worked as engineer at a
chemical plant. In 1927 Yuzik graduated from 7-year school and two years
later from a factory - and workshop school. In 1929-31 he was a worker at
chemical plant. In 1931 he left Rubezhnoe for Ivanovo, a city some 300 km
North-East of Moscow, and became a ﬁrst year student of the Institute of
Chemical Technology. In 1932 he moved from Ivanovo Institute to the second

course of Physical-Mechanical Department of the Leningrad Polytechnical
Institute. Here he specialized in chemical physics. Fellow students recalled
that Yuzik enthusiastically worked 14 hours a day and led rather ascetic
life. He searched in the library answers to questions which appeared during
lectures and had a special gift of clearly explaining to his friends all diﬃcult
problems.

3 Yuzik, are you a theorist?

In 1934-35 his advisor became Alexander Iosifovich Shalnikov (1905 – 1986).
Many years later academician Shalnikov recalled that he started by bringing
Yuzik to a room full with old vacuum pumps glass-ware and leaving him
there. Two weeks later, entering the room, Shalnikov found that everything
‘Yuzik, are you a theorist?”, – uttered
that could be broken was broken.
Shalnikov. “I don’t know. And what?” – was the answer.1

Shalnikov and his wife bought a ticket and put Yuzik on a train to
Kharkov, providing him with some money and food (it was a lean year).
Kharkov was known at that time as a new center of theoretical physics led
by the young Lev Davidovich Landau (1908 – 1968), who spent before a
few years at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen and decided to create
a similar cradle for young theorists in the Soviet Union, Yuzik became one
of the ﬁrst students of Landau. He passed the famous “theoretical minimum
exams” in two months (for many others it took years) and published his ﬁrst
paper on light by light scattering, together with A. Akhiezer and L. Landau
in 1936 in “Nature”.

Pomeranchuk was a devoted disciple of Landau. (The names Dau and
Chuk were coined by Landau.) “I am ready to go after Dau to the Dickson

island”, said young Chuk to one of his friends.
the Arctic Ocean near the shores of Siberia, at the mouth of Yenisey.) The
mutual respect and aﬀection thread runs all through their lives.

1This and future quotations are from the book “Vospominaniya o I.Ya. Pomeranchuke”,
Moskva, Nauka, 1988 (in Russian), which contains recollections of 83 authors and 7 sci-
entiﬁc reviews: describing the impact of Pomeranchuk on physics of elementary particles,
quantum ﬁeld theory, theory of nuclear reactors, synchrotron radiation, quantum liquids
and crystals, heat conductivity in dielectrics.

4 The 1936-1941 Firework

The “photon-photon” article started a ﬁrework of papers in various ﬁelds,
such as cosmic rays, neutron scattering in crystals, conduction of heat and
sound in dielectrics, electroconductivity of metals, superconductivity and
other subjects.

The most unexpected was the discovery that there should exist an upper
limit about 1017 eV on cosmic electron energy at the surface of the Earth due
to emission of photons in the magnetic ﬁeld of the Earth. Arkady Migdal
recalled that when Pomeranchuk told him about his idea, he (Migdal) was
convinced that such a weak ﬁeld could not inﬂuence the trajectory of ultra-
high energy particle. But intuition of Pomeranchuk turned out to be correct.
This eﬀect was the ﬁrst in a series of famous works of Pomeranchuk on the
theory of synchrotron radiation.

Among other results in condensed matter physics was the correction to
Peierls 1/T law for heat conduction at high temperature T . “It was not pleas-
ant, but it consoled me that I had been caught by very clever Pomeranchuk
but not by somebody else”, recalled Rudolf Peierls.

Not everything, on which Pomeranchuk worked at that time, was pub-
lished by him. In 1941 he gave three talks at a conference held in Moscow.
The program of the conference was published in “Journal of Physics of
USSR”. Two talks by Pomeranchuk “The production of mesotron pairs by
positron annihilation” and ‘The scattering of mesotrons by mesotrons” are
presented by the abstracts, while the third one “Nuclear reactions inside
stars” is presented by the title only.

5 Wanderings: 1937 – 1946

In 1937 under the threat of arrest Landau left Kharkov for Moscow, to join
the Kapitza Institute. Pomeranchuk followed him to become an assistant
lecturer at the Moscow institute of tanning industry.

The transfer to Moscow delayed Landau’s arrest only by a year: in 1938
he was imprisoned. Only a letter by Peter Kapitza to Stalin saved Landau’s
life, he spent in the prison a year.

After Landau’s arrest Pomeranchuk moved to Leningrad. In 1938-39 he
is an assistant lecturer at Leningrad University, defending there in 1938 his
PhD. In 1939-40 Pomeranchuk is a junior scientist at Leningrad Physical-

3

Technical Institute. In 1940 he comes back to Moscow as a senior scientist at
Lebedev Institute and defends his DSc dissertation “Heat conductivity and
absorption of sound in dielectrics”.
In 1941 the war started and Lebedev
Institute was evacuated to Kazan. From there in 1942 Pomeranchuk was
sent as a member of a group headed by Abram Isaakovich Alikhanov to
Armenia. The task of the group was to initiate the construction of a station
for study of cosmic rays at the Aragats mountain. They were on their way
to Armenia during the Stalingrad battle. In Yerevan Pomeranchuk together
with A.F. Kirpichev wrote three papers on the theory of cosmic ray showers.
In May 1943 Pomeranchuk returned to Moscow to become a member of
the Kurchatov team, working on the ﬁrst Soviet nuclear reactor. He worked
with Igor Vasilyevich Kurchatov at what was called Lab. No.2 and is now
called Kurchatov Institute till the beginning of 1946. For the rest of his life he
stayed at what then was called Lab. No.3 and is now called ITEP being the
founder and head of the ITEP theory division. Also in 1946 Pomeranchuk
became Professor of theoretical physics at Moscow Mechanical Institute (at
present MEPHI).

6 Neutrons in 1940s

Since 1943 Pomeranchuk was the leader of nuclear reactor theory in Soviet
Union. He developed the theory of exponential experiments which allowed
Kurchatov to measure the neutron absorption in moderator and the value of
moderation length.

Neutrons became dominant in his work in 1940s. Together with I. Gure-
vich he created a theory of resonance absorption of neutrons in heterogeneous
nuclear reactor with natural uranium. The construction of the ﬁrst Soviet
reactor completed in 1946 was based on this theory. (It was published as
a report at the International conference on peaceful applications of atomic
energy in 1955.) The theory of neutron absorption in homogeneous media
was developed by Pomeranchuk and Akhiezer in the manuscript “Introduc-
tion to the theory of neutron multiplying systems”, ITEP, 1947. It served
as a basic manual for construction of Soviet nuclear reactors for many years.
I remember using it as a novice calculating nuclear reactor for China in the
middle of 1950s. At that time its single copy was worn out to pieces. In 2002
the book was ultimately edited and published by B. Ioﬀe and A. Gerasimov.
A part of this manuscript was published as a separate book: A. Akhiezer

4

and I. Pomeranchuk “Certain problems of nuclear theory” in 1948 and then
in 1950. Theory of nuclear reactors was the main practical task of the the-
ory division created at ITEP by Pomeranchuk who recruited V. Berestetsky,
A. Galanin, B. Ioﬀe, A. Rudik. The non-reactor physics was considered as a
kind of a hobby.

7 “Hobby problems” in 1940s

The number, variety and quality of these “hobby problems” is quite im-
pressive: Pomeranchuk continued his research on phonons (heat and sound
conduction), on cosmic rays (on the atmospheric showers), on spectrum of
synchrotron radiation at electron accelerators. He published two articles: on
maximal energy of electrons in a betatron (1944, together with D. Ivanenko)
and on spectrum of synchrotron radiation (1946, together with L. Artsi-
movich). By the way, V. Vladimirsky found in 1948 that maximal energy of
showers produced by cosmic electrons in the atmosphere can be much larger
than the Pomeranchuk limit for a primary electron, because above 1018 eV
the quantum of radiation carries substantial part of electron’s energy. Pomer-
anchuk helped him to publish this result.

New themes appeared:
The ﬁrst theme:

liquid helium, in particular helium-3.

In 1948 he es-
tablished that both 3He and 6He admixtures to 4He belong to normal (non-
superﬂuid) component of liquid helium. This research culminated by the
famous 1950 paper in which Pomeranchuk has put forward the idea that the
entropy of helium-3 is smaller in liquid state than in the solid one and sug-
gested his method of reaching microkelvin temperatures. (The nuclear spins
of 3He should be aligned in the liquid phase (due to exchange forces) and not
aligned in the solid phase. Hence entropy of the latter is larger.)

Implementation and development of these ideas were crowned in 1996 by
Nobel Prize to David Lee, Douglas Osheroﬀ and Robert Richardson for their
discovery of superﬂuidity in helium-3. We have the privilege to listen today
to the talk of Professor Osheroﬀ.

The second theme: 1945, the ﬁnite size atomic nuclei with Z > 137.
Y.A. Smorodinsky who coauthored this article recalled that Pomeranchuk’s
enthusiastic exclamation “It would be great to collide two uranium nuclei!”
was met by laughter: nobody believed in such experiments. They were done
much later in Darmstadt.

5

The third theme: 1948, selection rules in the decay of positronium (the
three photon decay of orthopositronium and two photon decay of parapositro-
nium).

8 Arzamas-16

Early in 1950 Pomeranchuk was sent to the atomic weapon center at Arzamas-
16. The order was signed by Stalin. Pomeranchuk longed for his family (wife
and his stepdaughters) and for “hobby physics”. He used to come to N. Bo-
golubov (they lived in the same hostel) to discuss with him how to revoke the
order. Bogolubov entertained him with a cup of excellent strong coﬀee and
aphoristically uttered: “Orders are not revoked, usually they are forgotten”.
Within a year Pomeranchuk was again in Moscow, at ITEP.

9 QFT and zero charge

Pomeranchuk enthusiastically reacted to the breakthrough in quantum ﬁeld
theory. In 1951 he set up a special seminar to study the relativistic covariant
technique originated by Feynman, Dyson, Schwinger and others. He used it
in two diﬀerent ways: to elucidate the basic problems of the renormalization
procedure and to apply it to various speciﬁc phenomena.

On the ﬁrst way he and Landau discovered the fundamental diﬃculty
which they dubbed “zero charge”, and which is now referred to as “trivial-
ity problem”. They found that any ﬁnite value of “bare charge” (at short
distances) results in a vanishing “physical charge”, i.e.
in the absence of
interaction (at observable distances). This property was established ﬁrst in
quantum electrodynamics, then in various types of meson theories. An im-
portant role at this stage was played by V. Sudakov and K. Ter-Martirosyan
who joined ITEP in the 1950’s.

Only in the early 1970’s it became clear that the non-abelian gauge the-
ories do not suﬀer from this fatal disease. As you go to shorter distances the
non-abelian charges decrease providing “asymptotic freedom”. But even to-
day the disease discovered by Pomeranchuk and Landau is not eradicated. It
is hiding in the Higgs sector of the electroweak interaction. The ﬁght against
this disease is one of the driving forces of the modern ﬁeld theory.

6

10 Applications of QFT and S-matrix

In spite of unsolved “zero charge” basic inconsistency Pomeranchuk vigor-
ously applied QFT to various phenomena which did not “feel” this inconsis-
tency. Together with A. Galanin in 1952 he calculated the energy shift in
muonic atoms due to polarization of vacuum by virtual photon. He modiﬁed
in 1951 the approach suggested by E. Fermi to multiple production of pions
at high energies.

Pomeranchuk paid great attention to the characteristic time intervals at
which various processes took place. In 1953 together with L. Landau he found
how the standard Bethe-Heitler formula for Bremsstrahlung cross section is
modiﬁed in a medium. The characteristic time of the process is E2/m2ω,
where E – energy of the electron, m – its mass, and ω – frequency of the
photon. At high enough energy the emission length becomes so large that
multiple scattering is essential. Further reﬁnement of the problem was done
by A. Migdal. The LPM-eﬀect is under active study even at present.

In 1953 Pomeranchuk was elected corresponding member of Soviet Academy.

He became full member (academician) in 1964.

In 1950’s Pomeranchuk analyzed diﬀraction processes in the collisions
of nucleons at high energies and peripheral collisions with one-pion and two-
pion exchange. Here he relied on dispersion relations, which follow from such
general principles as causality and conservation of probability (analiticity and
unitarity of S-matrix).

On the basis of dispersion relations and of assumption that the radius of
a particle does not increase with its energy he proved in 1958 his famous the-
orem, according to which the cross-sections of a particle and its antiparticle
on a given target are equal to each other at asymptotically high energy.

Pomeranchuk theorem gave a strong impetus to experiments and theory
in particle physics, to building high energy accelerators and colliders. In 1958
the highest energy was about 1 GeV. Today it is measured by TeVs.

11 Pomeron

Theoretical analysis has shown quite soon that the assumption that the ra-
dius of, say, proton does not depend on energy, is too naive. It should increase
as logarithm of energy. But asymptotic equality of particle and antiparticle
cross-sections discovered by Pomeranchuk remained valid.

7

The asymptotic behaviour in s-channel depends on the angular momen-
tum j(t) of quasi-particles exchanged in t-channel (s = E2, t = q2): sj(t).
This angular momentum depends on t, forming in the plane j, t the so-called
Regge-trajectory. Hadrons with integer spin (mesons) and half-integer spin
(baryons) lie on these trajectories.

The behaviour of total cross-section depends on the value of j at t = 0 of
the trajectory with all quantum numbers (charge, isospin, C-parity) of the
vacuum. It was M. Gell-Mann who suggested to call this vacuum trajectory
the Pomeranchuk trajectory. The corresponding quasi-particle is referred to
as pomeron in the literature.

Pomeranchuk published about a dozen articles on reggeonic theory of
strong interactions (most of them with Vladimir Naumovich Gribov (1930-
1997)). The ﬁrst of these articles was published in 1962, the last – after
Pomeranchuk passed away.

During last four years of Pomeranchuk’s life his collaboration with Gribov
was fantastically intense. Gribov, who lived in Leningrad, regularly came to
ITEP, a few times Pomeranchuk took train to Leningrad. Their discussions
in Pomeranchuk’s oﬃce at ITEP lasted late into the night. Both of them
were heavy smokers. A cigarette was lighted from the previous one. The
smoke in the room was thick. Many years later J. Bj¨orken wrote that those
brilliant works had cleared the mist in the minds of theorists at Berkeley and
brightly demonstrated the extremely high level of research in certain ﬁelds
in the Soviet Union.

12 His disciples

Pomeranchuk inﬂuenced the development of physics not only through his
articles. He was a Great Teacher. Being the head of theory division at
ITEP, he at the same time was a Professor of theoretical physics at Moscow
Engineering Pysics Institute (MEPHI), which is hosting this memorial con-
ference. His former students were A. Rudik, I. Kobzarev, M. Terentyev,
Yu. Nikitin, A. Kaidalov, Yu. Simonov, Yu. Vdovin, I. Dremin, V. Mur,
E. Zhizhin, A. Berkov, B. Karnakov, I. Zuckerman and among many others
myself.

When in 1951 Pomeranchuk was designated to become the head of the
theory group in Dubna he brought with him one of his MEPHI students
S. Bilenky. For about a year Pomeranchuk used to come to Dubna every week

8

as a part time job. Among his disciples there was L. Lapidus. Pomeranchuk
strongly inﬂuenced the work of R. Ryndin and of many experimentalists.
According to recollections of B. Pontecorvo, V. Dzhelepov and many others
each visit by Pomeranchuk was a remarkable event in the life of physicists in
Dubna, who remembered his improvised seminars for many years.

ITEP theory division attracted also students from Moscow University.

The most prominent of them are B. Ioﬀe, M. Marinov and V. Popov.

The personality of Pomeranchuk is unforgettable to everybody who had
the luck to work with him, to listen to his lectures, or even only to meet
him. He was extremely devoted to physics and at the same time he was very
human. Great integrity was fused in him with sincere sympathy, with rare
sense of humor. Many of his jokes help us at ITEP to live through hard
times.

13 Fight against cancer

Pomeranchuk did not look an athlete, but he was strong, of great endurance
and of great courage. In the fall of 1965 doctors discovered that he was fatally
ill: cancer of esophagus. For more than a year he underwent chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, surgery (gastrotomy). But he continued to do physics in hos-
pitals and at home till his last day.

During the tragic days and nights of his illness Pomeranchuk was cared
for by his stepdaughter Marina who fought for his life with inexhaustible
energy. Today Marina Alexeevna Ivanova-Pomeranchuk is with us in this
hall.

Being treated by gamma-rays he thought about the Bragg peak in stop-
ping proton beam. It was obvious for him that protons, unlike electrons or
gamma-rays, would deliver most of their energy at the end of their track
inside the tumor. He summoned physicists from ITEP and Dubna together
with radiologist in the Oncological Center to start the program of proton
therapy at the existing proton accelerators. Unfortunately it was too late
to help him. But he thought about others. The ﬁrst medical proton beam
started to operate at ITEP in 1969. More than 3000 patients were success-
fully treated at ITEP. Recently special centers for proton therapy were built
in Western Europe and USA.

14 Pomeranchuk Prize

In 1998 Pomeranchuk Prize was established at ITEP. Up to now the inter-
national jury awarded it to ten physicists:

A. Akhiezer, S. Drell (1998)
K. Ter-Martirosyan, G. Veneziano (1999)
E. Feinberg, J. Bjorken (2000)
L. Lipatov, T. Regge (2001)
L. Faddeev, B. DeWitt (2002)
Professor B. DeWitt will receive the Prize today. Professor L. Faddeev –

at the ITEP International Winter School in February.

The names of 2003 prize winners will be announced on 20th of May 2003,

Pomeranchuk’s 90th birthday.

The constellation of laureates sheds a special light on the legacy of Pomer-
anchuk: on his formulas and ideas in various ﬁelds of physics, on his style of
research marked with deep intuition, ingenuity and hard work, on his devo-
tion to physics, his integrity, his striving to the heart of the matter, combined
with painstaking attention to details, his gift of a great teacher who shared
his enthusiasm and knowledge with his disciples and peers.

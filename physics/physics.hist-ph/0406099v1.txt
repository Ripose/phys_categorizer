The binary many-step Markov chain with the step-like memory function is considered as a model
for the analysis of rank distributions of words in stochastic symbolic dynamical systems. We prove
that the envelope curve for this distribution obeys the power law with the exponent of the order of
unity in the case of rather strong persistent correlations. The Zipf law is shown to be valid for the
rank distribution of words with lengths about and shorter than the correlation length in the Markov
sequence. A self-similarity in the rank distribution with respect to the decimation procedure is
observed.

The rank distributions (RD) in the stochastic systems
attract the attention of specialists in the physics and
many other ﬁelds of science because of their universal
power-law character (the so-called Zipf law (ZL) [1]. Dis-
covered originally for the RD of words in the natural
languages, the ZL was later observed in the rank distri-
butions of other objects, such as distributions of ”words”
in the DNA sequences [3], PC codes [3], capitals of stock
market players [4] (in economics, the Zipf law in slightly
diﬀerent form is known as Pareto’s principle or the 80-
20 rule [2]), the population of cities, areas occupied by
countries, masses of cosmic objects etc (see [5]). In spite
of a lot of endeavors to describe this phenomenon ana-
lytically, a deep insight into the problem has not so far
been gained.

To deﬁne the rank distribution of some objects in a
deﬁnite sequence, it is necessary to establish a correspon-
dence between objects and their frequencies of appearing
in the sequence and to arrange the objects in ascend-
ing order of these frequencies. A choice of the model
for analytical description of the Zipf law in RD is rather
ambiguous because of diversity of the systems where it
occurs [5]. Here the principal question arises concerning
the way of deﬁning the objects that are involved in a com-
petition according to the frequency of their occurring in
the sequence under consideration. There exist two prin-
cipally diﬀerent approaches to this problem. The ﬁrst
of them consists in considering the objects as a priori
equivalent, i.e. having ”the same rights” in the competi-
tion. The Zipf-law in rank distributions in such models
appears only due to the correlations that are present in
the sequence. The rank distribution of the triplets in the
DNA sequences can serve as a vivid example of the real
systems for which this approach is essential (see [3]).

∗yam@ire.kharkov.ua

The second approach deals with sequences where the
correlations does not play an essential role. However,
the competitive objects have a priori nonequal chances to
take a given place in the sequence. Mandelbrot‘s mod-
els [6, 7], the Kanter and Kessler model [8] and other
models are constructed on the basis of the choice of the
a priori nonequivalent competitors, and speciﬁcally this
non-equivalency is a reason for obeying the rank distribu-
tions to the Zipf law. For example, the non-equivalency
of the words in literary texts is caused by their diﬀerent
lengths and, consequently, by their diﬀerent statistical
weight that is deﬁned by a number of characters in the
word and the capacity of alphabet.

The nature of the real objects that satisfy the Zipf law
does not furnish suﬃcient arguments for giving prefer-
ence to one of the discussed approaches. It is possible
that both approaches describe diﬀerent mechanisms of
forming the power-law rank distributions.

In the present paper, we suggest an analytically solv-
able model of many-step Markov chain where the rank
distribution of diﬀerent L-words (L consequent symbols
in the chain) of a deﬁnite length L is examined. Since
the words are equal in their length, the rank distribution
in this system occurs as a result of the correlations. In
other words, our model is based speciﬁcally on the ﬁrst
approach to the choice of the competitors in the sequence.
The study that has been carried out allowed us to re-
veal the relation of the rank distributions to the existent
correlations in the system. The speculations about the
connection of the Zipf law to the long-range correlations
were expressed clearly by a number of authors [9, 10].
We have demonstrated that the short-range correlations
can also provide the appearance of the Zipf law.

We have analytically studied the rank distributions of
If a
words of certain length L in the Markov chains.
Markov chain possesses the one-step-like memory func-
tion considered in Ref. [11], this distribution is shown
to be of the many-step-like form. In the case of strong

correlations, the envelope curve for the rank distribution
obeys the power-law behavior with the exponent of the
order of unity, i.e. the distribution is described by the
Zipf law. The obtained results provide us with a suﬃcient
amount of information to clarify the origin of Zipf’s law.
In particular, we have made sure that the correlations of
symbols within the competitive words is suﬃcient for the
appearance of the Zipf law in their rank distributions.

The suggested approach to the problem of the Zipf
law is expedient because we are provided by the theoret-
ical parameters that aﬀect both the character of corre-
lations and the rank distribution of words occurring in
the Markov chain. Due to this circumstance, we could
examine the relationship between the rank distributions
and the correlation properties of the system.

Let us consider a homogeneous stationary unbiased bi-
nary sequence of symbols, ai =
, and deﬁne the
word as a set of sequential symbols of deﬁnite length
L. Diﬀerent words are obtained by progressively shift-
ing a window of the length L by one symbol in the se-
quence. The rank distribution of words is a relationship
connecting the probability W of certain word occurring
to the corresponding rank. The words are ordered in as-
W (2L). Our
cending rank order, W (1)
≥
sequence is the N -step Markov chain with the step-like
memory function. This means that the conditional prob-
ability P (ai
ai−N , ai−N +1, . . . , ai−1) of deﬁnite sym-
bol ai occurring (for example, ai = 0) after symbols
ai−N , ai−N +1, . . . , ai−1 in the chain is determined by the
equation,

Here k denotes the number of unities among N sym-
bols, ai−1, ai−2, . . . ai−N , preceding the generated one,
ai, and µ is the strength of correlations in the sequence,
1/2 < µ < 1/2. The case with µ = 0 corresponds to the
−
non-correlated random sequence of symbols. The posi-
tive (negative) values of µ correspond to the persistent
(anti-persistent) correlation (the attraction (repulsion) of
symbols of the same kind).

As was shown in Refs. [11, 12], the probability W of
certain L-word occurring depends on the number k of
unities in the word with L
N but is independent of
their arrangement. It is described by the formula,

Since the probability W (k) does not depend on the ar-
rangement of symbols within the L-word, the speciﬁc de-
generation takes place in the Markov chain under study.
Another kind of degeneration arises from the non-bias

Indeed, performing the ranking procedure (all words

The distribution Eq. (5) diﬀers from the usually discussed
power-law form by the logarithmic multiplier only. If one
neglects this weak logarithmic dependence, the Zipf law

the results of numerical simulations of the rank distribu-
tion of words of the length L = 14 in the Markov chain
generated with the same parameters N and µ. The dash-

The exponent in Zipf’s distribution Eq. (7) is governed

by the ratio n/L. In the case of weak correlations, at n

, the value of ζ tends to zero and the Zipf distribution

appears to be destroyed, i.e. all words of the length L
occurs with the almost same probabilities W = 2−L. The
opposite situation, n/L
0, corresponds to the strong
correlations in the Markov chain. Eq. (6) shows in this
case that the exponent ζ tends to unity. The plot of Zipf
distribution Eq. (7) with ζ = 7/11 is demonstrated by
the dash-dot-dotted line in Fig. 1.

According to statements given in the literature, the
Zipf law is associated with the property of scale invari-
ance [10], i.e.
invariance of the slope of the Zipf plot
with respect to certain decimation procedure. An anal-
ogous property referred to as the self-similarity, appears
in the frame of the model presented above. Let us reduce
the N -step Markov sequence by regularly (or randomly)
removing some symbols and introduce the decimation pa-
rameter λ < 1 which represents the fraction of symbols
kept in the chain. As is shown in Ref. [12], the reduced
chain possesses the same statistical properties as the ini-
tial one but is characterized by the renormalized memory
length, N ∗, and the persistence parameter, µ∗,

Indeed, the conditional probability p∗
k of occurring the
symbol zero after k unities among the preceding N ∗ sym-
bols in the reduced chain is described by Eq. (1) where N
and µ should be replaced by the renormalized parameters
N ∗ and µ∗. Considering the Zipf law, we are interested

in the invariance of the Zipf plot with respect to the dec-
imation procedure. According to Eqs. (5) and (6), the
slope of the Zipf plot depends on the parameter n only.
This parameter does not change after the transformation
µ∗ (see Eqs. (3) and (8)) . As a result, the
N
Zipf plots for rank distributions of L-words with L < N ,
obtained from the initial and decimated sequences, co-
incide. This self-similarity property is demonstrated in
Fig. 2.

Now, let us study the rank distribution of L-words with
L > N . This problem is not amenable to analytic calcula-
tions, and, therefore, numerical simulations are applied.
In this case, the above-mentioned degeneration of the
probability of word occurring is non-existent. So, smear-
ing of the steps in the rank distribution takes place at
L > N . This smearing occurs gradually with an increase
of the word length L and the steps appear to be com-
pletely smoothed away at high enough values of L (see
curves in Fig. 3). This means that the Zipf law describes
the rank distribution itself contrary to its envelope curve
at L < N .

is

It

important

to draw attention to the non-
monotonous behavior of the Zipf slope ζ with an increase
in the word length L. As is seen from Eq. (6), this param-
eter increases at L < N . This growth continues at L > N
as well but only up to a certain value of L = Lcr > N .
The maximum of ζ is observed at L = Lcr > N and
then, at L > Lcr, ζ starts to decrease. This decrease is
demonstrated in the inset to Fig. 3.

It is necessary to note that the position L = Lcr of

tively. The parameters of the Markov chain are N = 12, µ =

growth of the word length L. In the inset: the Zipf plots for

maximum in the ζ(L) dependence is strongly related to
the characteristic correlation length 2lc+N in the Markov
chain being studied. According to Ref. [12], the symbols
correlate with each other not only within the memory
length N but within the enlarged region 2lc + N where
lc represents the characteristic attenuation length of the
ﬂuctuations. Thus, the best ﬁtting of the rank distribu-
tion of words in the Markov chain by the power-law curve
is achieved if the size of the competitive words is close to
the correlation length.

If the words are shorter than the correlation length,
L < N + 2lc, the speciﬁc features of the correlations be-
come apparent in the rank distribution that results in de-
viations from the Zipf law. In the system that is consid-
ered in this paper, the deviations manifest themselves in
the appearance of the steps in the rank distribution and
in the additional weak logarithmic multiplier in Eq. (5).
Moreover, at very small N
1 the rank distribution
deviates signiﬁcantly from the power law and gets the
exponential shape at N = 1.

∼

In the opposite limiting case, at L

N + 2lc, the
correlations over the whole word length disappear and
the rank distribution tends to the constant.
It is im-
portant to note that speciﬁcally persistent correlations
in the Markov chain (that correspond to the attraction
between the same symbols) lead to the pronounced Zipf

law in the rank distribution of words. Indeed, the thin
solid line in Fig. 1 demonstrates the very weak W (R) de-
pendence for the case of the antipersistent correlations,
at µ =

15/46.

Thus, the obtained results allow us to suggest the fol-
lowing physical picture of the appearance of the Zipf law.
The correlations should be presented in the system but
the noise of suﬃcient strength should be imposed on these
correlations over the length of competitive words. Within
the considered stochastic system, this noise is provided
by suﬃciently strong ﬂuctuations observed on the scales
of the word length. The role of the noise consists in con-
cealing the speciﬁc peculiarities of the correlations. Ow-
ing to the ﬂuctuations, the concrete shape of the correla-
tions does not appear to be very important. Accordingly,
the Zipf law is a consequence of the rather rapidly damp-
ing persistent correlations of quite arbitrary form, i.e. the
global correlations in the system are not necessary. The
Zipf law is a manifestation of the inner microstructure of
the system being a result of attraction between building
blocks of the same kind.

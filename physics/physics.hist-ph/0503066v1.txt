Abstract

The problems in variation here concerned are such as to admit a continuous group (in Lie’s
sense); the conclusions that emerge from the corresponding diﬀerential equations ﬁnd their most
general expression in the theorems formulated in Section 1 and proved in following sections.
Concerning these diﬀerential equations that arise from problems of variation, far more precise
statements can be made than about arbitrary diﬀerential equations admitting of a group, which
are the subject of Lie’s researches. What is to follow, therefore, represents a combination of
the methods of the formal calculus of variations with those of Lie’s group theory. For special
groups and problems in variation, this combination of methods is not new; I may cite Hamel
and Herglotz for special ﬁnite groups, Lorentz and his pupils (for instance Fokker), Weyl and
Klein for special inﬁnite groups.1 Especially Klein’s second Note and the present developments
have been mutually inﬂuenced by each other, in which regard I may refer to the concluding
remarks of Klein’s Note.

§ 1. Preliminary Remarks and Formulation of Theorems

All functions occurring in the sequel are to be assumed analytic, or at least continuous and contin-
uously diﬀerentiable a deﬁnite number of times, and unique in the interval considered.

By a “group of transformation,” familiarly, is meant a system of transformations such that for
each transformation, there exists an inverse contained in the system, and such that the composition
of any two transformations of the system in turn belongs to the system. The group will be called a
ﬁnite continuous group Gρ if its transformations are contained in a most general (transformation)
depending analytically on ρ essential parameters ǫ (i.e., the ρ parameters are not to be representable
as ρ function of fewer parameters). Correspondingly, an inﬁnite continuous group G∞ρ is understood
to be a group whose most general transformations depend on ρ essential arbitrary functions p(x) and
their derivatives analytically, or at least in a continuous and ﬁnite-fold continuously diﬀerentiable
manner. The group depending on inﬁnitely many parameters but not on arbitrary functions stands
as an intermediate term between the two. Finally, a group depending both on arbitrary functions
and on parameters is called a mixed group.2

Let x1, . . . , xn be independent variables and u1(x), . . . , uµ(x) functions depending upon them. If
the x’s and u’s are subjected to the transformations of a group, then, by hypothesis of invertibility

the theory of inﬁnite continuous groups of transformations), Ber. d. K. Sachs. Ges. d. Wissensch 1981 (cited
as Grundlagen), deﬁnes the inﬁnite continuous group as a group of transformations which are given by the most
general solutions of a system of partial diﬀerential equations, provided these solutions do not depend only on a ﬁnite
number of parameters. One of the above-mentioned types diﬀering from the ﬁnite group will thus be thereby obtained;
whereas conversely the limiting case of inﬁnitely many parameters need not necessarily satisfy a system of diﬀerential
equations.

transformed quantities; let the other depending upon them be designated by v1(y), . . . , vµ(y). In

the transformations, the derivatives of the u’s with respect to the x’s, namely
occur.3 A function is called an invariant of the group if there subsists a relationship

Then, for an arbitrary, not necessarily invariant integral I, I form the ﬁrst variation δI and
transform it by partial integration according to the rules of the calculus of variations. As we know,

5All arguments x, u, ǫ, p(x) occurring in the transformations are to be assumed real, whereas the coeﬃcients
may be complex. But since the ﬁnal results are concerned with identities in the x’s, u’s, parameters and arbitrary
functions, these hold also for complex values, provided only that all functions that occur are assumed analytic. A
large portion of the results, incidentally, can be justiﬁed without integrals, so that here the restriction to reals is not
necessary even to the arguments. On the other hand, the developments at the close of Section 2 and beginning of
Section 5 do not appear to be feasible without integrals.

and a corresponding identity holds for the n-fold integral; in particular, A contains δu as far as
the (κ − 1)st derivative. The fact that (4), (5), and (6) actually deﬁne the Lagrange expressing ψi
follows from the fact that the combinations of the right-hand sides eliminate all higher derivatives
of the δu’s, while on the other hand the relation (2), to which the partial integration leads uniquely,
is satisﬁed.

Now in the following we shall be concerned with these two theorems:

I. If the integral I is invariant with respect to a Gρ, then ρ linearly independent combinations
of the Lagrange expressions become divergences — and from this, conversely, invariance of I
with respect to a Gρ will follow. The theorem holds good even in the limiting case of inﬁnitely
many parameters.

II. If the integral I is invariant with respect to a G∞ρ in which the arbitrary functions occur
up to the σ-th derivative, then there subsist ρ identity relationships between the Lagrange
expressions and their derivatives up to the σ-th order. In this case also, the converse holds.6

For mixed groups, the statements of both theorems hold; that is, both dependencies and diver-

gence relations independent thereof occur.

Passing over from these identities to the corresponding variation problem, i.e., putting ψ = 0,7
Theorem I in the one-dimensional case — where the divergence goes over into a total diﬀerential
— asserts the existence of ρ ﬁrst integrals, between which, however, non-linear dependencies may
subsist;8 in the multidimensional case, the divergence equations often referred to of late as “laws of
conservation” are obtained; Theorem II states that ρ of the Lagrange equations are a consequence
of the rest.

The simplest example of Theorem II — without converse — is aﬀorded by the Weierstrass
parametric representation; here the integral, with homogeneity of ﬁrst order, is as we know invariant
if the independent variable x is replaced by an arbitrary function of x that leaves u unchanged
(y = p(x); vi(y) = ui(x)). Thus one arbitrary function occurs, but without derivatives, and to this

corresponds the know linear relationship among the Lagrange expressions themselves
= 0.
Another example is presented by the “general theory of relativity” of the physicists; there we have
the group of all transformations yi = pi(x) of the x’s, while the u’s (designated as gµν and q)
are subjected to the transformations thereby induced for the coeﬃcients of a quadratic and linear
diﬀerential form — transformations which contain the ﬁrst derivatives of the arbitrary function
p(x). To this correspond the familiar n dependencies between the Lagrange expressions and their
ﬁrst derivatives.9

ψi

If in particular we specialize the group by allowing no derivatives of the u(x)’s in the transforma-
tions, and moreover let the transformed independent quantities depend only on the x’s, not on the
ψiδui,10
u’s, then (as is shown in Section 5) the invariance of I entails the relative invariance of

and likewise of the divergences occurring in Theorem I, once the parameters are subjected to suitable
transformations. For Theorem II, similarly, we get relative invariance of the left-hand sides of the
dependencies as associated with the aid of the arbitrary functions; and as a consequence of this,
another function whose divergence vanishes identically and admits of the group — mediating, in the
physicists’ theory of relativity, the connection between dependencies and the law of conservation of
energy.11 Theorem II, ﬁnally, in terms of group theory, furnishes the proof of a related Hilbertian
assertion about the failure of laws of conservation of energy proper in “general relativity.” With
these supplementary remarks, Theorem I comprises all theorems on ﬁrst integrals known to mechan-
ics etc., while Theorem II may be described as the utmost possible generalization of the “general
theory of relativity” in group theory.

§ 2. Divergence Relationships and Dependencies

Let G be a — ﬁnite or inﬁnite — continuous group; then it is always possible to arrange for the
zero values of the parameters ǫ, or of the arbitrary function p(x), to correspond to the identity
transformation.12 The most general transformation will therefore be of the form

yi = Ai

(cid:18)

where ∆xi, ∆ui stand for the terms of lowest dimension in ǫ, or p(x) and its derivatives; in which,
in fact, they will be assumed linear. As will afterwards, this is no restriction of generality.

Now let the integral I be an invariant with respect to G, satisfying, that is, the relationship (1).

Then in particular, I will also be invariant with respect to the inﬁnitesimal transformation

contained in G, and for this relation (1) goes over into

yi = xi + ∆xi;

vi(y) = ui + ∆ui;

where the ﬁrst integral is to be extended over the x + ∆x interval corresponding to the x-interval.
But this integration may alternatively be transformed into an integration over the x-interval, but

integrand must vanish identically; therefore Lie’s diﬀerential equations for the invariance of I goes
over into the relation

δf + Div(f · ∆x) = 0.

If in this, by (3), δf is expressed in terms of the Lagrange expressions, we get

ψiδui = Div B (B = A − f · ∆x),

X

and this relationship, therefore, for every invariant integral I, represents an identity in all arguments
that occur; it is the required form of Lie’s diﬀerential equations for I.13

Now for the present let G be taken to be a ﬁnite continuous group Gρ; since by hypothesis ∆u
and ∆x are linear in the parameters ǫ1, . . ., ǫρ, hence by (9) the same holds for δu and its derivatives;
therefore A and B are linear in the ǫ’s. So if I let

B = B(1)ǫ1 + . . . + B(ρ)ǫρ;

δu = δu(1)ǫ1 + . . . + δu(ρ)ǫρ,

where, that is δu(1), . . . are functions of x, u,
from (12):

, . . ., the required divergence relationships follow

ψiδu(1)

i = Div B(1);

. . .

ψiδu(ρ)

i = Div B(ρ).

(13)

X

X

Thus ρ linearly independent combinations of the Lagrange expressions become divergences; the linear
independence follows from the fact that by (9), δu = 0, ∆x = 0 would entail ∆u = 0, ∆x = 0, or
in other words a dependency between the inﬁnitesimal transformations. But by hypothesis, none
such is satisﬁed for any value of the parameters, since otherwise the Gρ regenerated by integration
from the inﬁnitesimal transformations would depend on fewer than ρ essential parameters. But the
further possibility δu = 0, Div(f · ∆x) = 0 was excluded. These conclusions hold good even in the
limiting case of inﬁnitely many parameters.

Now let G be an inﬁnite continuous group G∞ρ; then δu and its derivatives, and hence B also,
will again be linear in the arbitrary functions of p(x) and their derivatives;14 independently of (12),
further, by substitution of the values of δu, let

and analogously to the partial integration formula, the derivatives of p can be replaced by p itself

(15)

I now form the n-fold integral over (15), extended over any interval; and choose the p(x)’s such
that they, with all derivatives occurring in (B − Γ), will vanish at the boundary. Since the integral

13(12) goes over into 0 = 0 for the trivial case — which can occur only if ∆x, ∆u depend also on derivatives of the
u’s — when Div(f · ∆x) = 0, δu = 0; thus these inﬁnitesimal transformations are always to be eliminated from the
groups, and only the number of remaining parameters, or arbitrary functions, is to be counted in the formulation of
the theorems. Whether the remaining inﬁnitesimal transformations still form a group must be left moot.

14That it signiﬁes no restriction to assume the p’s free from u,

, is shown by the converse.

over a divergence reduces to a boundary integral, then, the integral over the left side of (15) will
also vanish for p(x)’s which are arbitrary except that they and suﬃciently many of their derivatives
vanish at the boundary; and thence follows, by known inferences, the vanishing of the integrand for
every p(x), or in other words the ρ relationships:

(λ = 1, 2, . . . , ρ).

(16)

These are the required dependencies between the Lagrange expressions and their derivatives for
invariance of I with respect to G∞ρ; the linear independence is proved as above, since the converse
leads back to (12), and since we can again argue back from the inﬁnitesimal transformations to the
ﬁnite ones, as will be explained more fully in Section 4. In the case of a G∞ρ, that is to say, even
in the inﬁnitesimal transformations there always occur ρ arbitrary transformations. Equation (15)
and (16) further entail Div(B − Γ) = 0.

If, as corresponds to a “mixed group,” ∆x and ∆u are taken linear in the ǫ’s and p(x)’s, then
we see, by equating ﬁrst the p(x)’s and then the ǫ’s to zero, that both divergence relationships (13)
and dependencies (16) hold.

§ 3. Converse in Case of Finite Group

To prove the converse, we are ﬁrst to run through essentially the foregoing arguments in reverse order.
From the fact of (13), by multiplication by the ǫ’s and adding, the fact of (12) follows; and thence,

by virtue of the identity (3), a relationship δf + Div(A − B) = 0. So if we put ∆x =

(A − B), we

1
f

have thereby arrived at (11); whence ﬁnally, by integration, there follows (7), ∆I = 0, or in other
words the invariance of I with respect to the inﬁnitesimal transformation determined by ∆x, ∆u,
where ∆u’s by virtue of (9) are determined from ∆x and δu, and ∆x and ∆u become linear in the
parameters. But ∆I = 0 entails, in known manner, the invariance of I with respect to the ﬁnite
transformations generated by integration of the simultaneous system

dx
dt

dui
dt

= ∆xi;

= ∆ui;

(xi = y, ui = vi, for t = 0).

(17)

These ﬁnite transformations contain ρ parameters a1 . . . aρ, namely the combinations tǫ1, . . ., tǫρ.
From the assumption that there are ρ and only ρ linearly independent divergence relationships (13),

∂u
∂x

, always
it follows further that the ﬁnite transformations, once they do not contain the derivatives
form a group. For in the contrary case, at least on inﬁnitesimal transformation generated by Lie’s
bracketing process would fail to be a linear combination of the other ρ; and since I admits of this
transformation also, there would be more than ρ linearly independent divergence relationships; or
else that inﬁnitesimal transformation would be of the special form where δu = 0, Div(f ·∆x) = 0, but
in that case ∆x or ∆u, contrary to hypothesis, would depend on derivatives. Whether this case can
arise when derivatives occur in ∆x or ∆u must be left moot; in that case, the ∆x determined above
must be augmented by all functions ∆x for which Div(f · ∆x) = 0 to restore the group property,
but by agreement the parameters thereby adjoined are not to count. This completes the proof of
the converse.

From this conversion, it follows further that ∆x and ∆u can actually be assumed linear in the
parameters. For if ∆u and ∆x were forms of higher degree in ǫ, then by the linear independence of
the power products of the ǫ’s, quite analogous relations (13) would follow, only in greater number,
from which, by the converse, invariance of I follows with respect to a group whose inﬁnitesimal
transformations contain the parameters linearly. If this group is to contain exactly ρ parameters, then
linear dependencies must subsist between the divergence relationships originally obtained through
the terms of higher degree in ǫ.

Let us add the remark that in the case where ∆x and ∆u also contain derivatives of the u’s,
the ﬁnite transformations may depend on inﬁnitely many derivatives of the u’s; for in that case the

Since the Lagrange expressions of a divergence vanish identically, the converse shows, ﬁnally, the
following: if I admits of a Gρ, then any integral that diﬀers from I only by a boundary integral, i.e.,
by an integral over a divergence, likewise admits of a Gρ having the same δu’s whose inﬁnitesimal
transformations will in general contain derivatives of the u’s. Thus for instance, corresponding to
the above example, f ∗

∆x = 0; while derivatives of the u’s occur in the inﬁnitesimal transformations corresponding to f .
Passing over to the variations problem, i.e., putting ψi = 0,15 (13) goes over into the equation
Div B(1) = 0, . . . , Div B(ρ) = 0, often referred to as “laws of conservation.” In the one-dimensional
case, it follows from this that B(1) = const., B(ρ) = const.; and here the B’s contain at most (2κ−1)st
derivatives of the u’s (by (6)), provided ∆u and ∆x contain no higher derivatives than the κ-th one
occurring in f . Since 2κ-th derivatives in general occur in ψ,16 therefore, we have the existence of ρ
ﬁrst integrals. That there may be non-linear dependencies among these is again shown by the above
f . To the linearly independent ∆u = ǫ1, ∆x = ǫ2 there correspond the linearly independent relations
u′′
)2; whereas between the ﬁrst integrals u′ = const., u′2 = const. a non-
linear dependency exists. This relates to the elementary case where ∆u, ∆x contain no derivatives
of the u’s.17

First let us show that the assumption of linearity of ∆x and ∆u constitutes no restriction, a con-
clusion which follows, even without the converse, from the fact that G∞ρ formally depends on ρ
and only ρ arbitrary functions. For it turns out that in the non-linear case, upon composition of
the transformations, whereby the terms of lowest order are added together, the number of arbitrary
functions would increase. In fact, say, let

tient of a single function or power product of one; the number of arbitrary functions, contrary to
hypothesis, has thus increased. If all coeﬃcients diﬀerent from a and b vanish, then, according to
the values of the exponents ν1, . . ., νρ, the second term will become the diﬀerential quotient of the
ﬁrst (as always, for example, for a G∞1), so that linearity does actually result; or else the number
of arbitrary functions must again increase. The inﬁnitesimal transformations, then, owing to the
linearity of the p(x)’s, satisfy a system of linear partial diﬀerential equations; and since the group
property is satisﬁed, they constitute an “inﬁnite group of inﬁnitesimal transformations” accord to
Lie’s deﬁnition (Grundlagen, § 10).

Now the converse is arrived at similarly to the case of the ﬁnite group. The fact that the
dependencies (16) hold leads, through multiplication by p(λ) and addition, by virtue of the identity
ψiδui = Div Γ and thence, as in Section 3 follows the determination of ∆x
transformation (14), to
and ∆u and the invariance of I with respect to these inﬁnitesimal transformations, if they contain

P

, . . ., certainly form a group, follows, as in Section 3, from the fact that otherwise,
no derivatives
by composition more arbitrary functions would occur, whereas by assumption there are to be only
ρ dependencies (16); hence they form an “inﬁnite group of inﬁnitesimal transformations.” But such
a one consists (Grundlagen, Theorem VII, p. 391) of the most general inﬁnitesimal transformations
of a certain “inﬁnite group G of ﬁnite transformations,” in Lie’s sense, thereby deﬁned. Each such
ﬁnite transformation is generated from inﬁnitesimal ones (Grundlagen, § 7),18 and so arises through
integration of the simultaneous system

dxi
dt

dui
dt

= ∆xi;

= ∆ui;

(xi = yi, ui = v, for t = 0),

where, however, it may be necessary further to assume the arbitrary p(x)’s dependent on t. Thus G
does actually depend on ρ arbitrary functions; if in particular it suﬃces to assume p(x) free from t,
∂u
∂x
. . ., occurs, it may be necessary also to adjoin inﬁnitesimal transformation(s) δu = 0, Div(f ·∆x) = 0
before drawing the same conclusions.

then this dependency becomes analytic in the arbitrary function q(x) = t · p(x).19 If derivatives

,

In terms of an example of Lie’s (Grundlagen, § 7), let us add mention of a fairly general case
in which it is possible to break through to explicit formulas, which at the same time show that
the derivatives of the arbitrary functions up to the σ-th order to occur; where, in other words,
the converse is complete. I refer to such groups of inﬁnitesimal transformations of the u’s thereby
“induced” corresponds; i.e., such transformations of the u’s for which ∆u, and consequently u,
∂u
∂x

depend only on the arbitrary functions occurring in ∆x; assuming further that the derivatives
. . . do not occur in ∆u. That is we have

,

∆xi = p(i)(x); ∆ui =

.

(cid:27)

Since the inﬁnitesimal transformation ∆x = p(x) generates every transformation ∆x = y + g(y) with
arbitrary g(y), we can in particular determine p(x) to depend on t in such a matter as to generate
the single-member group

xi = yi + t · gi(y),
18Hence it follows in particular that the group G generated from the inﬁnitesimal transformations ∆x, ∆u of a
G∞ρ reduces back to G∞ρ. For G∞ρ contains no inﬁnitesimal transformations distinct from ∆x, ∆u dependent on
arbitrary functions, and cannot contain any independent of them but depending on parameters, as otherwise it would
be a mixed group. But according to the above, the inﬁnitesimal transformations determine the ﬁnite ones.

(18)

19The question whether perhaps this latter case always occurs was raised in a diﬀerent formulation by Lie (Grund-

lagen, § 7 and § 13 at end).

which goes over into the identity for t = 0 and into the required x = y + g(y) for t = 1. For by
diﬀerentiation of (18), it follows that

dxi
dt

= gi(y) = p(i)(x, t),

where p(x, t) is determined from g(y) by inversion of (18); and conversely, (18) is generated from (19)
by virtue of the auxiliary condition xi = yi for t = 0, by which the integral is uniquely determined.
By means of (18), the x’s can be replaced in ∆u by the “constants of integration” y and by t;

the g(y)’s occurring just up to the σ-th derivative, the

’s being expressed in terms of

or transformations depending on exactly σ derivatives of the arbitrary functions. The identity is
contained in this, by (18), for g(y) = 0; and the group property follows from the fact that the method
speciﬁed aﬀords every transformation x = y + g(y), whereby the induced transformation of the u’s
is uniquely determined, and the group G accordingly exhausted.

From the converse it follows incidentally that it constitutes no restriction to assume the arbitrary

functions to be dependent only on the x’s, not on the u,

∂u

, . . .. For in the latter event, the

. . ., with arbitrary functions of x as coeﬃcients, then we again obtain dependencies (16), only
in greater number; which, however, according to the above converse, through conjunction with
arbitrary functions dependent on x only, reduce to the previous case. In the same way it is shown that
mixed groups correspond to simultaneous occurrence of dependencies and of divergence relationships
independent of them.20

,

20As in Section 3, it here again follows from the converse that besides I, every integral I ∗ diﬀerent from it by an
integral over a divergence likewise admits of an inﬁnite group, with the same δu’s, though ∆x and ∆u will in general
involve derivatives of the u’s. Such an integral I ∗ was introduced by Einstein in the general theory of relativity to
obtain a simpler version of laws of conservation of energy; I specify the inﬁnitesimal transformations that this I ∗
KdS
admits of, adhering precisely in nomenclature to Klein’s second Note. The integral I =
admits of the group of all transformations of the ω’s and those induced thereby for the gµν ’s; to this correspond the

Invariance of the Several Constituents of the Relations

If we specialize the group G to be the simplest case usually considered by allowing no derivatives
of the u’s in the transformations, and in that the transformed independent variables depend only
on the x’s not on the u’s, we can infer invariance of the several constituents in formulas. To begin

The question whether it is possible to argue from the invariance of

divergence relationships is synonymous, according to the converse, with the question whether one can thence infer
the invariance of I with respect to a group leading not necessarily to the same ∆u, ∆x, but to the same δu’s. In the
special case of the single integral and only ﬁrst derivatives in f , it is possible for the ﬁnite group to argue from the
invariance of the Lagrange expressions to the existence of ﬁrst integrals (c.f. e.g., Engel, G¨ott. Nachr. 1916, p. 270).

To apply this to the divergence relationships and dependencies derived, we must ﬁrst demonstrate
that the δu derived from the ∆u, ∆x’s does in fact satisfy the laws of transformation for the variation
δu, provided only that the parameters, or arbitrary functions, in δv are so determined as corresponds
to the similar group of inﬁnitesimal transformations in y, v; if Tq designates the transformation that
carries x, u over into y, v, and Tp and inﬁnitesimal one in x, u, then the one similar thereto in y, v
is given by T = TqTpT−1
q , where the parameters, or arbitrary functions r, are thus determined from
p and q. In formulas, this is expressed as follows:

Tp : ξ = x + ∆x(x, p);

u∗

= u + ∆u(x, u, p);

Tq : y = A(x, q);

v = B(x, u, q);

TqTp : η = A(x + ∆x(x, p), q);

v∗

= B(x + ∆x(p), u + ∆u(p), q).

But this generates Tr = TqTpT−1

q , or

η = y + ∆y(r);

v∗

= v + ∆v(r),

if by the inverse Tq we regard the x’s as functions of the y’s and consider only the inﬁnitesimal
terms; so we have the identity

η = y + ∆y(r) = y +

∂A(x, q)

= v + ∆v(r) = v +

∂B(x, u, q)

∆x(p) +

∂B(x, u, q)
∂u

∆u(p).

(20)

Replacing ξ = x + ∆x by ξ − ∆ξ in this so that ξ goes back into x, and ∆x vanishes, by the ﬁrst
equation (20) too will go back over into y = η − ∆η; if by this substitution ∆u(p) goes over into
δu(p), then ∆v(r) will go over into δv(r) as well, and the second formula (20) gives

δv(y, v, . . . r) =

X

so that the transformation formulas for variations are actually satisﬁed provided δv is assumed to
depend only on the parameters or arbitrary functions r.23

So in particular, the relative invariance of

ψiδui follows: hence also, by (12), since the diver-
gence relationships are satisﬁed in y, v as well, the relative invariance of Div B; and further, by (14)
and (13), the relative invariance of Div Γ and of the left-hand sides of the dependencies as conjoined
with the p(λ)’s, where the arbitrary p(x)’s (or the parameters) are to be replaced by the r’s every-
where in the transformed formulas. This leads as well to the relative invariance of Div(B − Γ), or
of a divergence of a not identically vanishing system of functions B − Γ whose divergence vanishes
identically.

P

From the relative invariance of Div B, we can draw additional inference of invariance of the ﬁrst
integral in the one-dimensional case and for ﬁnite group. The parametric transformation correspond-
ing to the inﬁnitesimal transformation becomes, by (20), linear and homogeneous, and owing to the
invertibility of all transformations, the ǫ’s also will be linear and homogeneous in the transformed
parameters ǫ∗. This invertibility is certainly preserved if we put ψ = 0, since no derivatives of the
u’s occur in (20). Through equating the coeﬃcients of the ǫ∗’s in

dy
dx
23It turns out again that y must be taken independent of u in order for the conclusions to hold. As an example,
consider the δgµν and δqρ given by Klein, which satisfy the transformations for variations provided the p’s are
subjected to a vector transformation.

the

B(λ)(y, v, . . .)’s therefore also become linear homogeneous functions of

B(λ)(x, u, . . .)’s so

B(λ)(x, u, . . .) = 0 or B(λ)(x, u) = const. duly entails

B(λ)(y, v, . . .) = 0 or B(λ)(y, v) =

const. as well. So the ρ ﬁrst integrals corresponding to a Gρ in each instance admit of the group,
with result that the further integration is simpliﬁed. The simplest example of this is that f is free
of x or of a u, which corresponds to the inﬁnitesimal transformation ∆x = ǫ, ∆u = 0, or ∆x = 0,

∆u = ǫ. We shall have δu = −ǫ
or ǫ respectively, and since B is derived from f and δu by

§ 6. A Hilbertian Assertion

From the foregoing, ﬁnally, we also obtain the proof of a Hilbertian assertion about the connection
of the failure of laws of conservation of energy proper with “general relativity” (Klein’s ﬁrst Note,
G¨ottinger Nachr. 1917, Reply 1st paragraph), and that in a generalized group theory version.

Let the integral I admit of a G∞ρ, and let Gρ be any ﬁnite group generated by specializing the
arbitrary functions, and hence a subgroup of G∞ρ. Then to the inﬁnite group G∞ρ there correspond
dependencies (16), and to the ﬁnite one Gσ, divergence relationships (13); and conversely from the
subsistence of any divergence relationships, the invariance of I follows, with respect to some ﬁnite
group which will be identical with Gσ if and only if the δu’s are linear combinations of those obtained
from Gσ. Thus the invariance with respect to Gσ cannot lead to any divergence relationships
diﬀerent from (13). But since the subsistence of (16) entails the invariance of I with respect to the
inﬁnitesimal transformations, ∆u, ∆x of G∞ρ for any p(x), it entails in particular nothing less than
invariance with respect to the inﬁnitesimal transformations of Gσ arising therefrom by specialization
and consequently with respect to Gσ. Thus the divergence relationships
i = Div B(λ) must
i =
be consequences of the dependencies (16), which latter may alternatively be written
Div χ(λ) where the χ(λ)’s are linear combinations of the Lagrange expressions and their derivatives.
Since the ψ’s occur linearly in both (13) and (16), the divergence relations must thus in particular
be linear combinations of the dependencies (16); Accordingly, Div B(λ) = Div
; and
the B(λ)’s themselves are thus linearly composed of the χ’s, i.e., the Lagrange expressions and their
derivatives, and of functions whose divergence vanishes identically, say like the B − Γ’s encountered
at the close of Section 2, for which Div(B − Γ) = 0, and where the divergence at the same time has
the invariant property. I shall refer to divergence relationships in which the B(λ)’s can be composed
from the Lagrange expressions and their derivatives in the speciﬁed manner as “improper,” and to
all other as “proper.”

If conversely the divergence relations are linear combinations of the dependencies (16), and so
“improper,” invariance with respect to Gσ follows from that with respect to G∞ρ; Gσ becomes a
subgroup of G∞ρ. The divergence relationships corresponding to an inﬁnite group Gσ will thus be
improper if and only if Gσ is a subgroup of an inﬁnite group invariant with respect to I.

By specialization of the groups, this yields the original Hilbertian assertion. Let “displacement

group” be understood to mean the ﬁnite

yi = xi + ǫi;

vi(y) = ui(x);

(

24In the cases where mere invariance of

ψiδui) dx entails the existence of ﬁrst integrals, these do not admit
(u′′δu)dx admits of the inﬁnitesimal transformation ∆x = ǫ2, ∆u = ǫ1 + xǫ3;
of the entire group Gρ; for example,
whereas the ﬁrst integral u − u′x = const., corresponding to ∆x = 0, ∆u = xǫ3, does not admit of the other
two inﬁnitesimal transformations, since it explicitly contains both u and x. To this ﬁrst integral, there happen to
correspond inﬁnitesimal transformations for f that contain derivatives. So we see that invariance
ψiδui) dx
is at all events a weaker condition than invariance of I, and this should be noted as to a question raised in a previous
remark.

will be referred to as “energy relationships,” since the laws of conservation” Div B(λ) = 0 corre-
sponding to the variation problem answer to “laws of conservation of energy,” and the B(λ)’s to the
“energy components.” So then we have: If I admits of the displacement group, then the energy re-
lationships become improper if and only if I is invariant with respect to an inﬁnite group containing
the displacement group as subgroup.25

An example of such inﬁnite groups is presented by the group of all transformations of the x’s
and such of the induced transformations of the u(x)’s in which only derivatives of the arbitrary
functions p(x) occur; the displacement group is generated by the specialization p(i)(x) = ǫi; but it
must remain undecided whether this — and the groups generated by change of I by a boundary
integral — suﬃces to give the most general of these groups. Induced transformations of the speciﬁed
kind arise, say, when the u’s are subjected to the coeﬃcient transformations of a “total diﬀerential

The most general I is determined by integration of Lie’s diﬀerential equation

25The laws of conservation of energy of classical mechanics as well as those of the old “theory of relativity” (where
dx2 goes over into itself) are “proper,” since no inﬁnite groups occur.
26From these inﬁnitesimal transformations, the ﬁnite ones are calculated backwards by the method given in Section

Hilbert enunciates his assertion to the eﬀect that the failure of proper laws of conservation of
energy is a characteristic feature of the “general theory of relativity.” In order for this assertion to
hold good literally, therefore, the term “general relativity” should be taken in a broader sense than
usual, and extended also to the forgoing groups depending on n arbitrary functions.27

27This again conﬁrms the correctness of a comment of Klein’s that the term “relativity” current in physics is
replaceable by “invariance relative to a group.” (“ ¨Uber die geometrishen Grundlagen der Lorentzgruppe,” Jhrber. d.

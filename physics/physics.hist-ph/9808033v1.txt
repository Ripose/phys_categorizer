1 Introduction

To investigate nature man has always used means which could explore the
world beyond human perception. Among these methods, the study of the
passage of particles and radiations through matter has been an extremely
thriving sector and one of basic importance for modern physics; moreover, it
has put to the test the minds of the greatest scientists of this century: Bohr,
Bethe, Fermi, just to quote some of them, for the list would be too long.

The knowledge of the interactions that take place in the passage of par-
ticles and radiations through matter, allowed possible to develop several de-
tectors, on whose characteristics the success of an experiment may depend
or not. From the analysis of this phenomena, many branches of physics and
astrophysics have originated; for example the study of matter in its elemen-
tary components, the study of cosmic rays, not to speak about the several
applications in the biomedical ﬁeld.

The main sector of application of these studies is, without doubt, particles
physics. It is enough to think about the impact that Wilson’s chamber had
in modern physics: we cannot observe a particle, but, at least, we can see
the eﬀects of its passage. Another example is given by the invention of a new
detector lead to the discovery and development of the studies on the third
lepton [1].

In the physics of cosmic rays, one of the most interesting questions is
nowadays represented by the existence or absence of antimatter in the uni-
verse:
in particular, one looks for heavy anti-ions, whose discovery could
have strong consequences in modern cosmological models [2]. In the past,
antiprotons and positrons were discovered in cosmic rays, while the antiatoms
observations (in particular of ¯4He and ¯12C) were prevented by the presence
of atmosphere. We think that the AMS (Alpha magnetic spectrometer ) ex-
periment, lauched at the beginning of June 1998, could give precious results
[3].

The studies on the interactions among matter, particles and radiations
allowed, since the X–rays discovery, the development of today necessary di-
agnostic tools. The accession of new detectors, along with the extraordi-
nary development of electronics, allowed us to obtain fundamental results
in medicine: just think about the positron emission tomography (PET), the
digital radiography, the free elctrons laser [4].

From the moment we decide to use these artiﬁcial “ﬁngers” in order “to
touch” a world out of our ordinary experience, questions of the utmost im-

2

portance arise. For example, what is the logical correlation between the
lightning in a scintillator and the passage of a proton? Is it possible to gain
informations from this lightning? What kind of informations? After all, the
most important question is: what do we measure, what do we observe?

The literature on this theme is practically boundless, because of the im-
portance of these studies in modern physics. We are not trying to make a
complete analysis of the theme here, for this would need at least a book: we
want to give an outline of the most important stages of the evolution of this
problem and invite the reader to consult the wide bibliography for a more
accurate investigation.

2 The XIX Century

Even though this story begins at the dawn of the XX century, its roots are to
be found in that extraordinary period of discoveries and contradictions that
characterized the end of the XIX century. In 1873, the scientiﬁc community
was upset by the publication of the Treatise on electricity and magnetism by
J.C. Maxwell, principally because not many had the necessary knowledge to
understand the work of the great Scottish scientist. The ﬁrst experimental
evidence of Maxwell’s theories came in 1886-1887 only, by H. Herz, who could
make experiments on the electromagnetic waves propagation. Nevertheless,
many questions remained unsolved:
in 1885, J.J. Thompson wrote that he
still did not understand what Maxwell called “quantity of electricity” [5].

For this researches, an extremely proliﬁc sector was that of electric dis-
charges in gases, principally began by Faraday in 1836 [6]. However, the
ﬁrst valid results were reached only later, thanks to a quick development of
the vacuum technology and to the invention in 1851 of the ﬁrst rudimental
transformer, the Ruhmkorﬀ coil: the device allowed to obtain electrical dis-
charges at very high voltage. The pioneers of this sector were Julius Pl¨ucker,
Willhelm Hittorf, Eugen Goldstein and Charles Varley [7]. In 1879, it was
Goldstein to propose the name of cathode rays to explain the phenomena
that take place in the electric discharge in extremely rareﬁed gases. The
question on the nature of these rays appeared immediately particularly mud-
dled and the physicists of the time were divided between those who were
for the undulatory hypothesis (aether waves) and those who were more in-
clined for a corpuscolar nature. A further contribution came from William
Crookes, who could make a whirl spin by striking it with cathode rays [7].

3

Moreover, he demonstrated that the action of a magnet could deviate these
rays. Therefore, the balance of science began to be inclined for the corpusco-
lar hypothesis, even though Heinrich Herz’s shrewdness played an important
role in the undulatory hypothesis.

The crucial stroke came by Jean Perrin [8] and, above all, by Joseph John
Thomson, director of the Cavendish laboratory in Cambridge. He demon-
strated deﬁnitively the corpuscolar hypothesis, by succeding in measuring
the ratio between the mass and the charge of a particle, to which the name
of electron was given (it had been minted by G.J. Stoney some years be-
fore) [9]. It is curious to note that, years later J.J. Thomson’s son, George
Paget, will become famous with the demonstration of the electron undulatory
properties.

In those years other discoveries conquered the world scene: the X–rays
were discovered in 1895 by Wilhelm C. R¨ontgen and radioactivity was dis-
covered in 1896 by Henry Becquerel. Physics began the new century with
two kind of particles, atoms and electrons, and with new radiations (X–rays,
radioactivity) and, above all, with many question marks.

3 Rutherford and Bohr

In Septembr 1895, Ernest Rutherford, a young New Zealander with many
hopes and little money, arrived in Cambridge. Thomson’s young assistant
recognized two diﬀerent kinds of radiations emitted by uranium and called
them α and β, because of the diﬀerent absorption in matter. In the following
years, Rutherford continued his researches on the nature of these rays in
Montreal and returned to England only in 1907 for a chair at Manchester
University. In his list of possible researches, the diﬀusion of the α–rays was
included: this lead to the discovery of the atomic nucleus.

However, Rutherford’s highest contribution was to change the linguistic
approach to the problem by putting in the foreground issues as collision,
scattering and passage of particles through matter [10]. To this purpose the
1905 article is particularly interesting: it suggested a theory on the origin of
the scintillation of zinc sulﬁde exposed to α radiations. Becquerel thought
that this was due to the cleavage of crystals bombarded by α particles, while
Rutherford did not write about a direct eﬀect, but about a secondary process,
the recombination of ions produced during the radiation passage.

In the ﬁrst edition of his book Conduction of electricity through gases,

4

J.J. Thomson had hinted to some issues regarding the ionization produced
by X–rays and by Bequerel’s radiations, nonetheless basing himself upon the
kinetic theory of perfect gases (diﬀusion of a ﬂuid in matter) [11]. In the
last chapter only, he considered the problem of what will happen when a
charged particle is stopped.
In the second edition of the book, published
in 1906 [12], Thomson wrote a ﬁrst theorical approach to the scattering of
two charged particles, elaborated again in a later article [13]. Nevertheless,
he remained tied to the intuitive conception according to which the collision
produced very small variations on the projectile trajectory; therefore the
projectile passed through matter as if it were in a tunnel bouncing on the
walls (multiple scattering).

This theory was discussed by Hans Geiger with the help of Ernest Mars-
den, a freshman: between 1908 and 1910 they published together a series of
articles, showing the existance of a diﬀusion of α particles [14], [15]. Even
though the particles reﬂected with angles wider than 90◦ were a small per-
centage (1 over 8000):

. . . it seems surprising that some of the α particles, as the
experiment shows, can be turned within a layer of 6 · 10−5 cm of
gold through an angle of 90◦, and even more [15].

Therefore, Rutherford’s surprise in seeing those results was great: spurred
by those results, the New Zealander scientist published, in 1911, his famous
essay, where he described the theory on the atoms structure: a nucleus sur-
rounded by electrons [16]. Moreover, he explained the reason why α particles
were reﬂected with wide angles, introducing the concept of a strong nuclear
ﬁeld due to the concentration of positive electric charge in an extremely small
area, nearly punctiform (dimensions ∼ 10−14 m).

The year after, a young Danish named Niels Bohr arrived at Manchester,
after a disappointing experience with Thomson at Cambridge. Bohr run
across the problem of the α rays energy loss while passing through matter.
While he was waiting for some radium to go on with an experimental job,
he was attracted by Charles Galton Darwin, grandson to the great Charles
Robert, who was in Manchester at the time [17]. Rutherford made Darwin
study the theory of the α–rays penetration in matter, for Darwin had a
degree in Applied Mathematics [18]. Bohr understood that the diﬃculties the
mathematician met were due to the two possible hypothesis on the electrons
distribution in the atom that Darwin had treated (in the volume of a sphere

5

centered in the nucleus or on the surface of that sphere) and decided to treat
the atomic electrons as oscillators. In the meanwhile, Thomson was carrying
on researches in this same ﬁeld, considering an atom with free electrons and
neglecting the results obtained in Manchester [19].

It was Niels Bohr who conﬁrmed the validity of Rutherford group’s ap-
proach, with an article ended and published the following year when he went
back to Denmark [20]. This essay did not only represent the ﬁrst suﬃciently
wide treatment on particles energy loss while passing through matter, but it
was also the prelude to the famous quantum theory of the atom, published in
the same year [21]. Among the most interesting points Bohr underlined there
were: the necessity of treating the collisions between atoms, α and β particles
in the same way (apart from the obvious diﬀerencies of mass and charge);
the time of collision and therefore a ﬁrst link with the electromagnetic theory
of dispersion; the evidence, nearly sure, of the fact that hydrogen has one
electron and helium has two. In 1915, Bohr published a second essay where
he exposed with greater deteails the theory of dispersion and considered the
relativistic eﬀects [22].

The particles slowing down in the passage through matter remained an
interest of Bohr for his whole life, so that after the discovery of the nuclear
ﬁssion the Danish physicist dedicated himself to the study of the passage of
ﬁssion fragments in matter [23], [24]. His last work was written in 1954 with
Jens Lindhard and regards in particular the capture or loss of electrons by
ﬁssion fragments in the passage through matter [25].

Bohr’s approach is based upon classic mechanics: he considers a heavy
particle that passes at such a distance to interact with one electron of one
atom of the material, initially considered at rest, thus deﬁning the impact
parameter b. The importance of this parameter consists in separating near
and distant collisions, that have therefore a diﬀerent behaviour [24]. The
collisions at distances d > b can be treated as electromagnetic excitations of
armonic oscillators charged in an electric ﬁeld, uniform in space, due to the
passage of the incident particle. On the other hand, if d < b, collisions can
be treated as scattering of free electrons by the incident particle. Choosing
b << γv/ω, that corresponds to the limit of the impact parameter beyond
which the energy tranfer in not eﬃcient, and b >> |z|e2/mv2γ, that can be
seen as a dimension of the scattering centre, the energy lost in the collisions

is given by the formula:

(1)

where Ri is the function of the impact parameter, though its contribution to
Eq. (1) is about 0.01%, giving therefore an indication of the poor sensibility
of Eq. (1) regarding the parameter. Moreover, Eq. (1) shows problems in
extreme cases, when b → 0 or b → ∞.

4 Bethe and Bloch

For many years Bohr’s works were practically unrivalled, though there was no
total agreement on the measures taken, in particular on the α and β particles.
In the twenties, after the birth of quantum mechanics, the deﬁciencies of
Eq. (1) were regarded as the failure of classic mechanics in the treatment of
atomic phenomena and, in particular, to the fact that energy tranfers, in this
kind of reactions, take place for discrete quantities.

The ﬁrst news arrived in the thirties, when Hans Bethe faced the problem
again by means of the new quantum mechanics [26]. To tell the truth, there
had been other attempts in the twenties, though not completely satisfactory.
Bethe solved the problem by using Born approximation, for which the width
of the wave scattered by the atomic electron ﬁeld must be small in regard
to the width of the incident wave (undisturbed), that is expressed in the
condition:
ze2
¯hv

<< 1

(2)

Condition Eq. (2) is satisﬁed in case of high speed and low electric charge of
the incident particle. A further sempliﬁcation came when the speed of the
incident particle is considered to be much higher than that of the electrons
of the absorbent material atoms:

E >>

Eel

M
m

where E is the energy of the incident particle and Eel is the ionization po-
tential of the atomic electron. Under these conditions and considering non-
relativistic speeds the energy loss is:

(3)

(4)

−

dE
dx

=

4πNz2e4

mv2 B

7

that gives the stopping power of the material. The term B (stopping number )
is expressed as:

B = Z ln

2mv2
I

(5)

(6)

(7)

Comparing Eq. (1) to Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) we note that the logarithmic
term in Bethe’s formula does not depend from the incident particle charge.
In the case of relativistic speeds, Eq. (5) becomes [27]:

B = Z

ln

(

2mv2
I

− ln(1 − β2) − β2

)

It is worth noting that Bethe’s and Bohr’s formulas have a ﬁeld of validity
each: therefore they can be considered complementary. A synthesis of the
two formulas was carried out in 1933 by Felix Bloch, who obtained:

−

dE
dx

=

4πz2e4
mv2 NZ

2mv2
I

ln

(

+ ψ(1) − Reψ

1 + i

 

ze2
¯hv !)

where ψ is the logarithmic derivative of Euler’s Γ function [28]. Eq. (7)
becomes Bethe’s formula for ze2/¯hv = 0, while it is reduced to Bohr’s formula
when ze2/¯hv >> 1. It is worth noting that Eq. (7) is referred to the case
of non–relativistic speeds. For β → 1 it is suﬃcient to detract the terms
[ln(1 − β2) + β2] to the quantity enclosed within brace brackets

In 1953, a detailed work by Bethe and Ashkin [29] was added to the
excellent review done by Bohr [24]; the new work included also various cards
and graphs relatives to experimental measures and it analysed widely any
possible anomaly.

5 Today

What is today known as the Bethe-Bloch formula is the principal instrument
to reckon the energy loss due to particles passage through matter. Several
correction coeﬃcients were added to consider many eﬀects [30], nevertheless
the Bethe-Bloch formula still remains the starting point.

8

A ﬁrst correction was signaled by Bhabha [31] and regarded the maximum
energy that can be transferred to an electron, initially at rest, in a free
collision, that results:

Tmax =

2mc2β2γ2
M + ( m

1 + 2γ m

M )2

(8)

and therefore takes the place of the simple 2mv2 in equation Eq. (5).

Another important corrective factor is the so called “density eﬀect”, due
to the fact that the electric ﬁeld of the incident particle has a tendence
to polarize atoms. As a matter of facts, Bohr, Bethe and Bloch’s analysis
regarded gases at low density; these gases can be seen as an aggregate of
indipendent particles, which does not happen in solid bodies or in liquid
ones.
In the fourties, Enrico Fermi noticed that the energy loss did not
depend from physical parameters only, those parameters Bethe and Bloch
took account of, though it depends also from the material dielectric properties
[32]. It is well worth to remember that in 1924 Fermi had already noticed the
analogy between the collision and dispersion phenomena and had proposed to
evaluate the stopping power by basing oneself upon the empirical evidence of
the high frequency radiation absorption [33]. To evaluate the density eﬀect
Fermi used classical electrodynamics and a simpliﬁed model of the atom;
later on, Gian Carlo Wick [34] and, independently (the time gap was due
to the war), Otto Halpern and Harvey Hall [35], used a more complicated
model, a multifrequencies one that takes account of the dispersion; moreover
Halpern and Hall considered also the damping of the conduction electrons.
An empirical expression of the density correction for a wide range of materials
was given by Sternheimer [36]. Later on, Sternheimer himself along with
Peierls, gave a generalized version of it [37].

However, the classical and semiclassical approach to density eﬀect was
readily substituted by the quantum one [38], [39], even though it did not
disappear completely. In 1960, Landau and Lifshitz still gave a semiclassic
version of it in their famous Course of Thoretical Physics [40] and in 1980
Ahlen wrote that this kind of approach may still be satisfactory, if it is
used in energy intervals where polarization eﬀects are not prevalent [30].
Between the macroscopic eﬀect and the microscopic one, another way has to
be signaled; it was followed by Aage Bohr to try and evaluate the relativistic
eﬀects, above all [41]. These are the cause of discordance between the classic
density correction and the quantum one: as a matter of fact it is necessary

9

to make a distinction between a longitudinal contribution and a transversal
one for the ﬁrst only is present in the classic derivation [38]. The transversal
term puts on a signiﬁcant probability at relativistic speeds and is to be held
responsible for ˇCerenkov radiation.

Another problem in the Bethe-Bloch formula is made up by the mean
excitation potential of the absorbing material (I), which is function of Z.
Being it an average value it is possible to mantain the computation at a
moderate accuracy level, which is an advantage. On the other hand, in ma-
terials composed by various elements and in particular in organic materials,
the chemical bond and other aggregation characteristics may insert sensitive
variations through changes in the spectrum of the excited levels [39].

Another assumption eﬀectuated in the Bethe-Bloch formula is that the
incident particle is decidedly faster than atomic electrons as speciﬁed in equa-
tion Eq. (3). Nevertheless, as the incident particle speed decreases, the con-
tribution to the stopping from the inner shell electrons (K, L, . . .) disappears.
It is therefore necessary to insert a further correction coeﬃcient to take this
phenomenon into account [42], [39].

Moreover, there may be diﬀerences in conformity with the incident parti-
cle, if it is positive or negative. It is the so called “Barkas eﬀect”, discovered
in the 50’s studying the decay of K → 3π: it was observed that the π− par-
ticles had slightly longer paths than the π+ ones [43]. A further correction
coeﬃcient is then introduced and it depends, according to the partcle, from
z3 or z4 [44].

For other correction coeﬃcients or changes to be introduced in the Bethe-
Bloch formula according with its use, we would suggest to read the wide
reviews listed in the bibliography, in particular [29], [30].

Lately, the only news of a certain prominence is the theory by Jens Lind-
hard, a Bohr’s scholar, and Allan Sørensen, relative to the energy loss of
heavy ions at relativistic speeds; this theory starts from the well–known
Bethe-Bloch formula [45]. The authors notice that the deviations that take
place in the case of relativistic ions are to be expressed in terms of cross
section for the scattering of an electron, free from the Coulomb ﬁeld of ions;
the authors carry out the necessary computations using Dirac equation for
relativistic ions.

which is adaptable to the majority of cases. Some correction coeﬃcients -
already discussed above - follow. As we can see the Bethe-Bloch formula is
sill today a “ﬁnger” of physics, perhaps the most important one. Maybe,
it is a botched up one but is is still very eﬃcient and it is a necessary in-
strument not only for the understanding of the world around us though also
for its technological applications.
It is well worth to think about the use
of radiations in cancers treatment, a terapy that requires a great caution to
avoid telling the famous joke: “the operation was successfull, but the patient
died”.

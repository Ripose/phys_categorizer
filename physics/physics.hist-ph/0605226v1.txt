Abstract

In the centennial of Ettore Majorana’s birth (1906—1938?), we
re-examine some aspects of his fundamental scientiﬁc production in
atomic and molecular physics, including a not well known short com-
munication. There, Majorana critically discusses Fermi’s solution of
the celebrated Thomas-Fermi equation for electron screening in atoms
and positive ions. We argue that some of Majorana’s seminal contri-
butions in molecular physics already prelude to the idea of exchange
interactions (or Heisenberg-Majorana forces) in his later works on the-
oretical nuclear physics. In all his papers, he tended to emphasize the
symmetries at the basis of a physical problem, as well as the limita-
tions, rather than the advantages, of the approximations of the method
employed.

Key words: Ettore Majorana; Enrico Fermi; Thomas-Fermi model;
exchange interactions; atomic and molecular models; neutron.

1 Introduction

Ettore Majorana’s most famous, seminal contributions are certainly those
on the relativistic theory of a particle with an arbitrary instrinsic angular
momentum [1], on nuclear theory [2], and on the symmetric theory of the
electron and the positron [3]. In particular, the latter paper already contains
the idea of the so-called Majorana neutrino [3], as has been correctly em-
phasized [4]. The quest for Majorana neutrinos is still the object of current
fundamental research (see, e.g., Ref. [5], and Ref. [6] for a general overview).
In this note, we would like to reconsider two more papers by Majorana
[7, 8], both on atomic and molecular physics, and show how they are pre-
cursor to his theoretical work on the exchange nuclear forces, the so-called

1

Heisenberg-Majorana forces [2]. We will also try and emphasize his criti-
cal sense and great ability to catch the relevant physical aspects of a given
problem, beyond his celebrated mathematical skills, as witnessed by contem-
poraries and colleagues who met him personally [9, 10, 11] (see especially
Ref. [12] for more references).

Both Amaldi and Segr`e have provided us with a vivid account of Ma-
jorana’s ﬁrst meeting with Enrico Fermi. Majorana and Fermi ﬁrst met in
1928 at the Physical Institute in Via Panisperna, Rome. At that time, Fermi
was working on his statistical model of the atom, known nowadays as the
Thomas-Fermi model, after the names of the two authors who derived it in-
dependently [13, 14, 15]. Such a model provides an approximate alternative
to solving Schr¨odinger equation [16], and paved the way to density functional
theory [17].

2 Thomas-Fermi model

Within Thomas-Fermi approximation, the electronic cloud surrounding an
atom is described in terms of a completely degenerate Fermi gas. Following
Ref. [16], one arrives at a local relation between the electron density ρ(r)
at position r with respect to the nucleus, and the momentum pF(r) of the
fastest electron (Fermi momentum), as

ρ(r) = 2 ·

4π
3

p3
F(r),

where the factor of two takes into account for Pauli exclusion. In Eq. (1),
the Fermi momentum pF(r) depends on position r through the self-consistent
potential V (r) as

p2
F(r) = 2m[EF − V (r)],
where EF is the Fermi energy, and m is the electron mass. Fermi energy EF
is then determined via the normalization condition

(2)

where N is the total electron number, equalling the atomic number Z for a
neutral atom. Inserting Eq. (2) into Eq. (1), making use of Poisson equation,
and introducing Thomas-Fermi screening factor φ through

ρ(r) d3r = N,

a0 =

Z 1/3 a0,

with a0 the Bohr radius.

Eq. (5) is ‘universal’, in the sense that the sole dependence on the atomic
number Z comes through Eq. (7) for b. Once Eq. (5) is solved, the self-
consistent potential for the particular atom under consideration is simply
obtained by scaling all distances with b.

3 Asymptotic behaviour of the solution to

Thomas-Fermi equation

Fermi endeavoured to solve Eq. (5) analytically without success. On the
occasion of his ﬁrst meeting with Majorana, Enrico succintly exposed his
model to Ettore, and Majorana got a glimpse of the numerical results he had
obtained over a week time, with the help of a primitive calculator. The day
after Majorana reappeared and handled a short note to Fermi, where he had
jotted down his results. Majorana was amazed that Fermi’s results coincided
with his own.

How could Majorana solve Eq. (5) numerically in such a short time with-
out the help of any calculator? Various hypotheses have been proposed. Did
he ﬁnd an analytical solution? At any rate, there are no physically accept-
able analytical solutions to Eq. (5) in the whole range 0 ≤ x < +∞. The
only analytical solution,

would have been found later by Sommerfeld in 1932 [18], and is physically
meaningful only asymptotically, for x ≫ 1.

φ(x) =

144
x3 ,

The most likely hypothesis is probably that of Esposito [19], who, together
with other authors [20], has found an extremely original solution to Eq. (5) in
Majorana’s own notes (see also Ref. [21]). The method devised by Majorana
leads to a semi-analytical series expansion, obeying both boundary conditions
for a neutral atom

φ(0) = 1,
φ(∞) = 0.

In a recent work, Guerra and Robotti [22] have rediscovered a not well
known short communication by Majorana, entitled Ricerca di un’espressione
generale delle correzioni di Rydberg, valevole per atomi neutri o ionizzati
positivamente (Quest for a general expression of Rydberg corrections, valid
for either neutral or positively ionized atoms) [7].
In that work, perhaps
in the attempt of improving the asymptotic behaviour of the solution to
Thomas-Fermi equation, Ettore requires that the potential vanishes for a
certain ﬁnite value of x, say x0, both for neutral atoms and for positive ions.
He writes the self-consistent potential as

where, for an atom positively ionized n times (n = Z − N), the constant C
equals

where

b = 0.47

One immediately notices that, due to the new boundary conditions, Eq. (10)

does not reduce to Eq. (4) even for n = 0, i.e. for a neutral atom. In other
words, Majorana does not consider the potential V (r) in a generic location

of the electron cloud, but the eﬀective potential acting on a single electron,
thus excluding the interaction of an electron with itself.

Probably, owing to his profound critical sense (let us remind that his
colleagues in the Panisperna group nicknamed him the ‘Great Inquisitor’),
Majorana must have not excessively relied on his own solution [19], which
however reproduced the numerical solution of Thomas-Fermi equation quite
accurately. Probably, Majorana was looking for a solution which should not
decrease so slowly as x → ∞, as Eq. (8) does.

In Fig. 1 we report Thomas-Fermi screening factor φ as a function of r for
a neutral Ne atom (Z = N = 10). The solid line refers to Fermi’s numerical
solution, with boundary conditions given by Eq(s). (9), the dashed line refers
to Majorana’s solution, with boundary conditions given by Eq(s). (13) with
n = 0, while the light dashed line has been obtained within the Hartree-Fock
approximation (see App. A for a derivation). As it can be seen, Majorana’s
solution introduces only a minor correction to Fermi’s solution at ﬁnite x
values, but is strictly zero for x ≥ x0.

In his work on positive ions [23], Fermi considers a potential vanishing

which in particular imply Eq. (9b) in the case n = 0, corresponding to a

In Fig. 2, we again report Thomas-Fermi screening factor φ as a function
of r according to Fermi, Majorana, and Hartree-Fock, respectively, but now
for a positively ionized Ne atom, Ne+ (Z = 10, N = 9, n = 1). Majorana’s
solution again diﬀers but marginally from Fermi’s solution, but while for
a neutral Ne atom Fermi’s solution decreases too slowly, it decreases too
rapidly for Ne+.

Here, we are not disputing whether Majorana’s note, Ref. [7], should be
considered as a ‘full’ paper [24], nor do we want to undervalue the importance
of the contribution analyzed in Ref. [19]. We would rather like to emphasize

6

that Majorana was conscious that his correction1 did not lead to substantial
modiﬁcations to Fermi’s solution of Eq. (5), including in the asymptotic limit
(x ≫ 1) [27].

Ettore never published anything else on this subject.

4 Helium molecular ion

In his successive work [8], Majorana deals with the formation of the molec-
ular ion He+
2 . There again, Majorana demonstrates his exceptional ability
to focus on the main physical aspects of the problem, while showing the
limitations of his own theoretical approximations. He immediately observes
that the problem is more similar to the formation of the molecular ion H+
2 ,
than to the reaction He + H. The most relevant forces, especially close to
the equilibrium distance, are therefore the resonance forces, rather than the
polarization ones. By exchanging the two nuclei, the system remains un-
changed. Majorana makes then use of the method of Heitler and London
[28], and emphasizes the importance of inversion symmetry with respect to
the middle point between the nuclei, set at a distance R apart.

Heitler and London [28] introduced a relatively simple expression for the
wave-function Ψ of the two electrons in a hydrogen molecule H2 in terms of
the wave-functions ϕ and ψ of one electron in the atomic orbital correspond-
ing to atom a and b, respectively:

Ψ(1, 2) = ϕ(1)ψ(2) ± ψ(1)ϕ(2),

(15)

where 1 and 2 denote the coordinates of the two electrons, respectively. The
wave-function ΨS, corresponding to the choice of the plus sign in Eq. (15), is
symmetric with respect to the exchange of the coordinates of both electrons
and nuclei, while ΨA (minus sign in Eq. (15)) is antisymmetric. The full
wave-function is globally anti-symmetric, but here we are neglecting its spin
part, since the Hamiltonian is spin independent.

Despite its simplicity, the success of Heitler-London approximation relies
on the fact that it explained the stability of the H2 molecule, and could
reproduce with remarkable accuracy the dependence of the total electronic
energy EI on the internuclear distance R. One obtains the attractive solution
1Fl¨ugge [25] erroneously attributes this correction to Amaldi. Probably, he was only

aware of Fermi and Amaldi’s ﬁnal work, Ref. [26].

7

in correspondence with the eigenfunction ΨS. It is relevant to stress at this
point that, if one had considered only ϕ(1)ψ(2), or ψ(1)ϕ(2), in Eq. (15), the
agreement with experimental data would have been rather poor. Therefore,
the resonance or exchange term is quite decisive for establishing the chemical
bond.

Heitler-London theory is even more accurate than the method of molecu-
lar orbitals [29, 30, 31, 32] (see, e.g., Ref. [33] for a more detailed discussion),
which in addition to Eq. (15) takes into account also for the ionic-like con-
ﬁgurations

ϕ(1)ϕ(2) and ψ(1)ψ(2),

(16)

corresponding to having both electrons on atom a, or b, respectively, on the
same footing and with equal weights as the terms in Eq. (15). However,
the theory can be improved by adding to Eq. (15) the two contributions in
Eq. (16) with appropriate weights, to be determined variationally.
As in Heitler-London, in order to study the case of He+

2 , also Majorana
starts from the asymptotic solution, namely for large values of R. In the case
of H2, for large values of R, it is very unlikely that both electrons reside on the
same nucleus. Similarly, in the case of He+
2 , Majorana neglects the possibility
that all three electrons be located on the same nucleus. Ettore then proceeds
by writing the unperturbed eigenfunctions for the three electrons (labeled 1,
2, 3 below) in He+

2 as

A1 = ϕ1Ψ23,
A2 = ϕ2Ψ31,
A3 = ϕ3Ψ12,

B1 = ψ1Φ23,
B2 = ψ2Φ31,
B3 = ψ3Φ12,

(17a)
(17b)
(17c)

where Φ and ϕ denote the wave-functions of the neutral and ionized a atom,
respectively, while Ψ and ψ denote the analogous wave-functions for atom b.
Evidently, A2 and A3 can be obtained from A1 by permuting the electrons,
and the B’s from the A’s by exchanging the nuclei.

The interaction between the atoms mixes all these wave-functions, but
by means of general symmetry considerations, ﬁrst introduced by Hund [34],
as well as of inversion symmetry and of Pauli exclusion principle, Majorana
concludes that the only acceptable wave-functions are

y1 = A1 − A2 + B1 − B2,
y2 = A1 − A2 − B1 + B2,

(18a)
(18b)

In particular, y2 corresponds to the
which are antisymmetric in 1 and 2.
(1sσ)2 2pσ (2Σ) conﬁguration, viz. the bonding solution for the He+
2 molec-
ular ion. The latter conﬁguration is characterized by two electrons in the σ
molecular orbital built from the two 1s atomic orbitals, one electron in the σ
molecular orbital built from the 2p atomic orbitals, as well as by a value of
the total orbital angular momentum L = 0, and by a value of the total spin
S = + 1
2. The wave-function Eq. (18b) clearly shows that the ground state
is a resonance between the conﬁgurations He : − He· and He · −He : , where
each dot denotes the presence of one electron on the a or b atom.

In order to perform the calculation of the interaction terms explicitly,
making use of analytic expressions, one can take the ground state of the
helium atom as the product of two hydrogenoid wave-functions. However,
it is well known that the result is greatly improved if, instead of taking
the bare charge Z = 2 of the He nucleus, an eﬀective nuclear charge Zeﬀ
is introduced, to be determined variationally. The fundamental eﬀect here
taken into account by Majorana is that of screening: In an atom with many
electrons, each electron sees the nuclear charge Ze as slightly attenuated by
the presence of the remaining electrons.

The concept of an eﬀective nuclear charge, already introduced for the
helium atom, had been extended by Wang [35] to the hydrogen molecule.
Probably Majorana was not aware of Wang’s work, since he does not refer
to it in his 1931 paper. In any case, Majorana is the ﬁrst one to make use of
such a method for He+
2 . In making reference to his own work [36], where Zeﬀ
is used as a variational parameter for He+

2 , Pauling reports in a footnote2

“The same calculation with Zeﬀ given the ﬁxed value 1.8 was
made by E. Majorana [8].”

The variational value obtained by Pauling for Zeﬀ is 1.833.

By making use of his results, Majorana evaluates the equilibrium internu-
clear distance as d = 1.16 ˚A, in good agreement with the experimental value
1.087 ˚A. He can then estimate the vibrational frequency as n = 1610 cm−1,
which he compares with the experimental value 1628 cm−1. Majorana con-
cludes his paper by stating [8] that his own result is

“casually in perfect agreement with the experimentally deter-
mined value”

(our italics). Any other author would have emphasized such a striking agree-
ment as a success of his own method, whereas Majorana rather underlines
the drawbacks of his own approximations.

We would like to remind that he also estimates the minimum energy, i.e.
the dissociation energy, ﬁnding the value Emin = −1.41 eV, but he had no
available experimental data to compare with, at that time. However, he is
not satisﬁed with such a result and collects [8]

“all the errors of the method under the words ‘polarization forces’,”

which he estimates for very distant nuclei using the polarizability of the
neutral He atom. He then ﬁnds Emin = −2.4 eV. More recent theoretical
calculations, using the method of conﬁguration interactions [39] or ab initio
variational methods [40], have estimated the value Emin = −2.47 eV. The
experimental value has been accurately determined quite recently [41] as
Emin = −2.4457 ± 0.0002 eV. We are not claiming that Ettore’s result is

10

more accurate than the theoretical results mentioned above. However, he
certainly understood the essential physical eﬀects for that system, and made
use of appropriate approximations to estimate them.
In particular, it is
interesting how he emphasizes the quest for the symmetries of the system (see
the translation of a paper by Majorana in Ref. [20]). As in the case of H2, also
for He+
2 it is essential to include the position exchange term between He and
He+, in order to have chemical bonding, as it can be seen in Fig. 3, redrawn
after Ref. [38]. If one had neglected the resonance He : He+ ⇀↽ He+ : He (see
dashed line in Fig. 3), chemical bonding would have been impossible.

5 The discovery of the neutron

Rutherford’s pioneering work [42] paved the way not only to Bohr’s atomic
model, but also to nuclear physics.

In 1930 Bothe and Becker [43], like Rutherford, employed α particles
against a berillium target in a scattering experiment. They observed the
emission of a very penetrating radiation, which they interpreted as γ rays. In
successive experiments, Ir`ene Curie and Frederic Joliot [44, 45], her husband,
developed further these experiments, but they arrived at similar conclusions.
According to Emilio Segr`e’s account [46], Majorana thus commented the
Joliots’ results:

“They haven’t realized they have discovered the neutral proton.”

At this point we should remind that at that time it was believed that
the nucleus was composed by protons and electrons. It was Chadwick [47]
who soon after demonstrated that the radiation emitted in the Joliots’ ex-
periments was made up by neutral particles, whose mass is very close to the
proton’s mass. It was probably Fermi [46] who ﬁrst distinguished between the
neutrinos conjectured by Pauli, and the neutrons discovered by Chadwick.
Meanwhile, Majorana developed a theory of the nucleus containing pro-

tons and neutrons and then, according to Segr`e [46],

“he analyzed, as far as it was possible, the nuclear forces on the
basis of the available experimental results, and he estimated the
binding energies of the lightest nuclei. When he presented his
work to Fermi and ourselves, we immediately recognized its im-
portance. Fermi encouraged Majorana to publish his own results,

but Majorana refused to do so, saying they were yet too incom-
plete.”

More than that, when Fermi asked Majorana whether he could make refer-
ence to his results during a forthcoming conference in Paris, Ettore mockingly
replied he would agree, provided the reference was attributed to an old pro-
fessor of electrochemistry, who was also going to attend the same conference.
Obviously, Fermi could not accept Majorana’s condition, and no reference
was then made to his results during the conference.

Meanwhile, people started feeling the lack of a theory of nuclear forces,
conveniently taking into account for the presence of both protons and nucle-
ons in the nucleus. But where to begin with?

6 Heisenberg-Majorana forces

To this aim, in three fundamental contributions [48, 49, 50], Heisenberg as-
sumed hydrogen molecular ion H+
2 as a model. He recognizes that the most
important nuclear forces are not the polarization forces among the neutrons,
or Coulombic repulsion among protons, but the exchange forces between
protons and neutrons.

(LCAO) approximation. Cf. Fig. 2.4 in Ref. [51], where the same quantities
have been obtained within a variational method.

Heisenberg emphasizes that neutrons obey to Fermi statistics. Moreover,
since a neutron possesses spin 1
2¯h, it cannot be simply thought of as composed
of a proton plus an electron, unless the latter has zero spin, when inside a
neutron.3 A neutron is an elementary particle per se. The interactions
postulated by Heisenberg are characterized by the exchange of both position
coordinates and spins of the two nucleons.

Similarly, Majorana assumed that the fundamental nuclear forces are of
exchange nature between protons and neutrons. However, he fully exploits
the analogy with H+

2 (see Fig. 4), regardless of spin.4

3Besides considerations concerning the spin, such a model would require an enormous

amount of energy to localize the electron within the neutron [49].

4Current literature usually employs the formalism of isotopic spin to describe the ex-
change character of the nuclear forces. However, as noted by Blatt and Weisskopf [52],
this is equivalent to a description which makes use of the forces of Bartlett, Heisenberg,
Majorana, and Wigner.

13

Let r1, σ1 and r2, σ2 stand for the position and spin coordinates of the
ﬁrst and the second nucleon, respectively, and let ψ(r1, σ1; r2, σ2) be the wave-
function for a given nucleon pair [52]. Then Heisenberg exchange P H implies

(19)

(20)

(21)

P Hψ(r1, σ1; r2, σ2) = ψ(r2, σ2; r1, σ1),

whereas Majorana exchange P M implies

P M ψ(r1, σ1; r2, σ2) = ψ(r2, σ1; r1, σ2).

In Majorana’s own notation (apart from a minus sign here included in the
deﬁnition of J(r)), the exchange interaction then reads [2]

(Q′, q′|J|Q′′, q′′) = J(r)δ(q′ − Q′′)δ(q′′ − Q′),

where Q and q are the position coordinates of the neutron and the proton,
respectively, and r = |q′ − Q′| is their relative distance. Majorana then plots
a qualitative sketch of J(r) (cf. Fig. 2 in Ref. [2]), which closely resembles
the behaviour of the potential energy in H+
2 , when the internuclear repulsion
is neglected (Fig. 5).

In the same paper [2], in addition to his knowledge of molecular physics,
Majorana fully exploits also his acquaintance with the atomic statistical
model. Indeed, he deﬁnes the nuclear density as

8π
3h3 (P 3
in complete analogy with Eq. (1), where Pn and Pp are the Fermi momenta
of neutrons and protons, respectively. From this model, he derives an asymp-
totic expression (ρ → ∞) for the exchange energy per particle,

n + P 3
p ),

(22)

ρ =

a(ρ)|ρ→∞ = −

n2
n1 + n2

J(0),

(23)

where n1 and n2 are the numbers of neutrons and protons, respectively. As
in Thomas-Fermi model, the kinetic energy per particle, t say, is given by
t ∝ ρ2/3.

(24)

From the competition between kinetic and potential energy, the total energy
attains a minimum as a function of r (cf. Fig. 1 in Ref. [2]).

Majorana’s model explains two fundamental properties of nuclear physics
[52]: (a) the density of nucleons is about the same for all nuclei (density
saturation); (b) the binding energy per nucleon is about the same for all
nuclei (binding energy saturation).

14

7 Concluding remarks

In some of his fundamental papers, Majorana mainly focussed on the asymp-
totic properties of the potential and of the wave-function of an atomic or
molecular system. This is clearly demonstrated in his work on helium molec-
ular ion, He+
2 [8]. On the basis of his hypercritical spirit, Majorana was
probably unsatisﬁed with the asymptotic behaviour of the screening factor
φ within Thomas-Fermi model, but his note [7] is too short to conﬁrm that.
What we can certainly emphasize is his taste for the quest of symmetries,
and their relevance to determine the main properties of a physical system
[24]. This led him to demonstrate that the exchange symmetry is essential
to the formation of the chemical bond. Exchange symmetry is also central
in his model of the nuclear forces.

The quest for symmetries is evident in his famous work on the symmetrical

theory of the electron and the positron [3]. There, he notes that

“all devices suggested to endow the theory [53] with a symmetric
formulation, without violating its contents, are not completely
satisfactory.
[. . . ] It can be demonstrated that a quantum the-
ory of the electron and the positron can be formally symmetrized
completely by means of a new quantization procedure. [. . . ] Such
a procedure not only endows the theory with a fully symmetric
formulation, but also allows one to construct a substantially new
theory for chargeless [elementary] particles (neutrons and hypo-
thetical neutrinos).”

Several important experiments [5, 6] are currently under way to observe

the ‘Majorana neutrino’.

A Thomas-Fermi screening factor

within Hartree-Fock approximation

In order to critically assess the accuracy of Fermi’s and Majorana’s approx-
imate solutions for the atomic screening factor φ in Thomas-Fermi model,
let us brieﬂy derive it within the Hartree-Fock self-consistent approxima-
tion. The solution of Hartree-Fock equations enables one to determine the
(spherically symmetric) radial electron density

normalized to the total electron number as

D(r) = 4πr2ρ(r),

∞

Z

0

D(r) dr = N

(25)

(26)

(see, e.g., Ref. [54]). The radial electron density D(r) of a neutral Ne atom is
characterized by two peaks, referring to the 1s and 2s 2p shells, respectively
(cf. Fig. 8.6 in Ref. [54]). In the case of Ne+, such peaks are slightly shifted
at smaller values of r. Although D(r) is always strictly diﬀerent from zero
over the whole r range, it is an exponentially decreasing function of r, with
D(r) ≈ 0 roughly deﬁning the atomic (respectively, ionic) radius.

By relating the electric ﬁeld | ~E| = (1/e)∂V /∂r corresponding to the self-
consistent potential, Eq. (4), to that generated by the nucleus and the elec-
tron cloud within a distance r from the nucleus, by Gauss law, one ﬁnds

(27b)

where a prime here refers to derivation with respect to r.

Within Thomas-Fermi approximation, φ(r0) = 0, where r0 is the ionic
radius, and the integration in the normalization condition, Eq. (26), should
actually be performed up to r = r0. Then, Eq. (27a) reduces to Fermi’s
boundary condition, Eq. (14b).

Within Hartree-Fock approximation, D(r) is in general nonzero at any
ﬁnite r. However, as r → ∞, the potential experienced by a test charge is
that of a charge (Z − N)e, i.e. V (r) − EF ∼ −(Z − N)e2/r. Comparing such

an asymptotic behaviour of the potential with the deﬁnition of the screening
function φ in Eq. (4), one has

lim
r→∞

φ(r) = 1 −

.

rφ′(r) = 0,

lim
r→∞

On the other hand, making use of the latter result, from Eq. (27a) it follows
that

thus implying that φ′(r) vanishes as r → ∞ more rapidly that 1/r (in fact,
it vanishes exponentially).

Finally, from Poisson equation, −∇2V = 4πe2[−Zδ(r) + ρ(r)], for a given

electron charge distribution, Eq. (25), one obtains

at any r > 0. Integrating once between r and ∞, and making use of the
limiting value Eq. (29), one obtains

φ′′ =

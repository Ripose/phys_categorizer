Quantum Mechanics: Bell and Quantum Entropy for the Classroom

Philipp Pluch
Department of Statistics, Klagenfurt University

In this article we are willing to give some ﬁrst steps to quantum mechanics and a motivation
of quantum mechanics and its interpretation for undergraduate students not from physics. After
a short historical review in the development we discuss philosophical, physical and mathematical
interpretation. We deﬁne local realism, locality and hidden variable theory which ends up in the EPR
paradox, a place where questions on completeness and reality comes into play. The fundamental
result of the last century was maybe Bell’s that states that local realism is false if quantum mechanics
is true. From this fact we can obtain the so called Bell inequalities. After a didactic example of the
fact what these inequalities means we describe the key concept of quantum entanglement motivated
here by quantum information theory. Also classical entropy and von Neuman entropy is discussed.

The Interpretation

Don’t try to understand quantum mechanics
or you will fall into a blackhole and never be
heard from again. Richard Feynman

I. QUANTUM MECHANICS AND ITS
INTERPRETATION

During the last century, quantum theory has proved
to be a successful theory, which describes the physical
reality of the mesoscopic and microscopic world. Up to
now, no method is known which contradicts the predic-
tions made by quantum theory. This is remarkable, since
measurements accuracy has increased, and the size of the
systems under consideration has decreased at a fast pace.
Quantum mechanics was developed with the aim to de-
scribe atoms and to explain the observed spectral lines
in a measurement apparatus. During the development
of quantum mechanics the fact that quantum theory al-
lows for an accurate description of reality is obvious from
many physical experiments, and has probably never been
seriously disputed. On the other hand, for the interpre-
tation of quantum mechanics, things could not be more
diﬀerent. Since the theory of quantum mechanics has
been formulated, following question arise:

How can we interpret the mathematical for-
mulation of quantum mechanics?

in which people
This question leads to a discussion,
with diﬀerent philosophical backgrounds gave diﬀerent
answers. Quantum theory and quantum mechanics
do not account for single measurement outcomes in
a deterministic way. One accepted interpretation of
quantum mechanics is the Copenhagen interpretation.
The Copenhagen manifest argued that a measurement
causes an instantaneous collapse of the wave function
which describes the quantum system, the system is after
the collapse random - pure chaos.
The most prominent opponent to the Copenhagen
interpretation was Albert Einstein, who had developed
a way from instrumentalism of positivism to a rational

realism. Einstein did not believe in the idea of genuine
randomness in nature, the main argument in the Copen-
hagen interpretation. In his view quantum mechanics is
incomplete and suggested that there had to be ’hidden’
variables, responsible for random measurement results.
In fact the famous paper ’Can quantum mechanical
description of physical reality be considered complete?’,
authored by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen in 1935,
which condensed the philosophical discussion into a
physical argument. They claim that given a speciﬁc
experiment,
in which the outcome of a measurement
could be known before the measurement take place,
there must exist something in the real world, an ’element
of reality’, which determines the measurement outcome.
They postulate, that these elements of reality are local,
in the sense that they belong to a certain point in
space-time. This element may only be inﬂuenced by
events which are located in the backward light cone of
this point in space-time. Even though these claims sound
reasonable and convincing, these are assumptions about
nature, which are nowadays known as local realism.

A. Local Realism

The principle of locality is that objects at diﬀerent
places cannot have direct inﬂuence on one another. An
object is inﬂuenced directly only by its immediate sur-
roundings. Einstein argued:

The following idea characterises the relative indepen-
dence of objects far apart in space (A and B): external
inﬂuence on A has no direct inﬂuence on B; this is known
as the Principle of Local Action, which is used consis-
tently only in ﬁeld theory. If this axiom was to be com-
pletely abolished, the idea of the existence of quasi en-
closed systems, and thereby the postulation of laws which
can be checked empirically in the accepted sense, would
become impossible.

Local realism is the combination of the principle of
locality with the assumption that all objects must objec-

tively have their properties already before these proper-
ties are observed. Einstein argued with the moon:

The Moon is out there even when no one is observing

it.

Local realism is a signiﬁcant feature of classical gen-
eral relativity and classical Maxwell’s theory, but quan-
tum mechanics rejects this principle. Every theory that,
like quantum mechanics, is compatible with violations
of Bell’s inequalities must abandon local realism. (The
vast majority of physicists believe that experiments have
demonstrated such violations, but some local realists dis-
pute this with the argumentation of loopholes in the
tests.) Diﬀerent interpretations of quantum mechanics
reject diﬀerent parts of local realism.
In interpretations like the Copenhagen interpretation
where the wavefunction is assumed to have no direct
physical interpretation or reality, the many-worlds in-
terpretation and the interpretation based on Consistent
Histories, it is realism that is rejected. The actual deﬁ-
nite properties of a physical system ’do not exist’ prior to
the measurement and the wavefunction has a restricted
interpretation as nothing more than a mathematical tool
used to calculate the probabilities of experimental out-
comes, in agreement with positivism in philosophy as the
only topic that science should discuss.
In the version of the Copenhagen interpretation where
the wavefunction is assumed to have a physical interpre-
tation or reality (the nature of which is unspeciﬁed), the
principle of locality is violated during the measurement
process via the wave function collapse. This is a non-
local process because Born’s Rule, when applied to the
system’s wave function, yields a probability density for all
regions of space and time. Measuring the physical system
S the probability density vanishes everywhere instanta-
neously, except where and when the measured entity is
found to exist. This vanishing is a physical process, and
clearly non-local, if the wave function is considered phys-
ically real and the probability density converged to zero
at arbitrarily far distances during the duration for the
measurement process.
Bohm interpretation wants to preserve realism, and it
needs to violate the principle of locality to achieve the re-
quired probability distributions. It also violates causality
which implies a conﬂict with special theory of relativity
because real, superluminal signals would have to be prop-
agated.
Because of the diﬀerences in the interpretations, which
are philosophical except the one of Bohm, physicists use
an language independent of the interpretation.
In this
context, only the measurable action at a distance - a
superluminal propagation of real, physical information
- would be considered as a violation of locality by the
physicists. Such phenomena have never been build by
experiments and they are not predicted by theories. (Pos-
sible exception can be Bohm’s theory).
Locality is the main axiom of relativistic quantum ﬁeld

2

theory in connection with causality. A formalization of
locality is if two observables localized within two distinct
space-time regions must commute. This interpretation
of ’locality’ is closely related to the relativistic version in
physics.
In the EPR paper the argument is a thought experiment
on pairs of entangled particles. This experiment shows
that both position and momentum of the particles are el-
ements of reality. Quantum mechanics does not include
states for which position and momentum are well-deﬁned
(because of the measurement) simultaneously. From this
point EPR conclude that quantum mechanics is incom-
plete. The problem is a description of variables, which
correspond to the elements of reality. This variables are
the local hidden variables.

B. Non-locality and Hidden Variable Theories

Einstein never prize the implications of quantum
theory, despite the undeniable triumph of quantum the-
ory. Einstein’s faith was that quantum mechanics could
be completed by adding various as-yet-undiscovered
variables. For him hidden variables would let us to a
deterministic description of nature.

’God does not play dice’

The completeness of quantum mechanics was attacked
by the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Gedanken experiment
with the argument that there have to be hidden vari-
ables in order to avoid non-local, instantaneous eﬀects at
a distance. The position-momentum uncertainty relation
served as a guideline for their argument, although it is
most clear to us with the help of Bohm employing a pair
of spin- 1

2 particles in a singlet state.

C. EPR Paradox

The EPR paradox draws on a phenomenon predicted
by quantum mechanics, known as quantum entangle-
ment, to show that measurements performed on spatially
separated parts of a quantum system can apparently have
an instantaneous inﬂuence on one another, now known as
nonlocal behaviour. We illustrate this in a simpliﬁed ver-
sion of the EPR thought experiment due to Bohm.
Let us consider a source that emits pairs of electrons,
with one electron sent to Alice and the other to Bob. We
arrange our source in such a way that each emitted elec-
tron pair occupies a quantum state called a spin singlet.
This is a quantum superposition of two states, (a) and
(b). In state (a), electron A has spin upward along the
z-axis (+z) and electron B has spin downward along the
z and
z). In state (b) the electron A has spin
z-axis (

−

−

−
z, Bob will get +z.

the electron B has spin +z. So it is impossible to as-
sociate either electron in the spin singlet with a state of
deﬁnite spin. The electrons are thus said to be entangled.
Alice measures the spin along the z-axis and obtains one
of two possible outcomes: +z or
z, suppose she gets
+z. So the quantum state of the system S collapses into
state (a). The quantum state determines the probable
outcomes of any measurement performed on the system.
In this case, if Bob subsequently measures spin along the
z-axis, he will obtain
z with probability 1. Similarly, if
Alice gets
Let us suppose that Alice and Bob now decide to measure
spin along the x-axis. According to quantum mechanics,
the spin singlet state may equally well be expressed as
a superposition of spin states pointing in the x direc-
tion. We call these states (a1) and (b1). In state (a1),
Alice’s electron has spin +x and Bob’s electron has spin
x and Bob’s
−
electron has spin +x. If Alice measures +x, the system
x. If Alice mea-
collapses into (a1), and Bob will get
sures
x, the system collapses into (b1), and Bob will
−
get +x.
Because of quantum mechanics the x-spin and z-spin
are incompatible observables, this means that there is
a Heisenberg uncertainty principle operating between
them: a quantum state cannot possess a deﬁnite value for
both variables. Let us now suppose Alice measures the z-
spin and obtains +z, so that the quantum state collapses
into state (a). Now Bob measures the x-spin. Accord-
ing to quantum mechanics, when the system is in state
(a), Bob’s x-spin measurement will be with probability
0.5 +x and with probability 0.5
x. Furthermore, it is
fundamentally impossible to predict which outcome will
appear until Bob actually performs the measurement.

D. Completeness and Reality

deﬁnitely known, so it is an element of physical reality.
After Alice’s measurement the spin of Bob’s electron is
an element of physical reality.
We conclude that a quantum state cannot possess a def-
inite value for both x-spin and z-spin. If quantum me-
chanics is a complete physical theory the x-spin and z-
spin cannot be elements of reality at the same time. So
Alice’s decision whether to perform a measurement along
the x-axis or z-axis has an instantaneous eﬀect on the el-
ements of physical reality at Bob’s location. This is a
violation of the principle of locality.
The principle of locality says that physical processes oc-
curring at one place should have no immediate eﬀect on
the elements of reality at another location. This is a rea-
sonable assumption to make, as it seems to be a conse-
quence of special relativity: information cannot be trans-
mitted faster than lightspeed without violating causality.
It is generally believed that any theory which violates
causality would also be internally inconsistent, and thus
deeply unsatisfactory.
It turns out that quantum mechanics violates the prin-
ciple of locality without violating causality. Causality is
preserved because there is no way for Alice to transmit
information to Bob by manipulating her measurement
axis. Which axis she uses, she has a probability 0.5 of
obtaining + and probability 0.5 of obtaining
. In the
quantum mechanic context, it is impossible for her to in-
ﬂuence the results. On the other hand Bob is only able
to perform his measurement once, the ’no cloning theo-
rem’ makes it impossible to make copies of the electron
he receives to perform a classical statistical analysis. In
the measurement he perform there is a probability 0.5 of
, regardless of
getting + and probability 0.5 of getting
whether or not his axis is aligned with Alice’s one.
We now discuss the impossibility of copying states. Sup-
pose the state of a quantum system A is a qubit, which
we wish to copy, given by

2. The completeness of a physical theory

EPR did not directly address the philosophical meaning
of an ’element of physical reality’. They made a assump-
tion that if the value of any physical quantity of a system
can be predicted with absolute certainty prior knowledge
to performing a measurement or otherwise disturbing it,
then that quantity corresponds to an element of physical
reality. We note here that the converse is not true.
EPR deﬁned a complete physical theory as one in which
every element of physical reality is accounted for. They
showed that using these two deﬁnitions quantum me-
chanics is not a complete physical theory.

EPR discussed the consequences of these two conditions
on observations of quantum particles that had previously
interacted with one another. The conclusion was that the
particles would exhibit correlations that lead to contra-
dictions with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, so quan-
tum mechanics is incomplete.
EPR paradox motivated Schr¨odinger’s to introduce en-
tanglement as the characteristic feature of quantum me-
chanics. J. Bell (Bell 1964) tried to ﬁnd a way of show-
ing that the notion of hidden variables could remove the
randomness of quantum mechanics. EPR paradox was
ﬁrst nothing more than a philosophical debate for many
physicists. Bell’s theorem concluded that it is impossible
to mimic quantum theory with the help of a set of local
hidden variables. Consequently any classical imitation
of quantum mechanics is non-local. But this fact does
not imply the existence of any non-locality in quantum
theory itself.

II. BELL’S THEOREM

For more than three decades no prove of the existence
of local hidden variables was formulated. No empirical

4

methods to prove the existence or non existence of
hidden variables were available.
In 1964 J.S. Bell noticed in his work ’On the Einstein-
Podolsky-Rosen paradox’ that the existence of
local
hidden variables implies a certain inequality (the so
called Bell inequality) between measurement outcomes,
while quantum mechanics predicts measurement out-
comes which violate this inequality. In Bell experiments
it is possible to check whether the predictions of quan-
tum mechanics are correct in the sense of local hidden
variables, or whether nature obeys the Bell inequalities,
in the sense that quantum mechanics would predict
wrong measurement results: quantum mechanics would
be wrong rather than incomplete.
Bell experiments were discussed very deep in literature
and have been performed and they were excellent
agreement with the predictions of quantum mechanics.
However, the importance of Bell’s experiment is not
due to the fact that quantum mechanics has once more
it shows
shown to give a precise description of nature:
that the microscopic world is guided by laws which
are inherently non classical:
it is not possible to add
something to quantum mechanics which would make it
a classical theory.

A. Bell’s Gedanken Experiment

S

Bell considered a setup in which two observers, Alice
and Bob, perform independent measurements on a sys-
prepared in some ﬁxed state. Each observer has
tem
a detector as a measurement apparatus. On each trial,
Alice and Bob can independently choose between vari-
ous detector settings. Alice can choose a detector setting
a to obtain a measurement A(a) and Bob can choose a
detector setting b to measure B(b). Alice and Bob col-
lect statistics on their measurements and correlate the
results.
There are two main assumptions in Bell’s analysis:

1. Each measurement reveals an objective physical

property of the system.

2. A measurement taken by one observer has no eﬀect

on the measurement taken by the other.

Bell’s inequality and its experimental violation destroyed
the idea that quantum mechanics can be described by a
classical theory. However, the insight that quantum me-
chanics is a non classical theory did not only destroy
hopes, but also allowed the dawn of a new era in physics,
the so called quantum physics. Physicists started to re-
alise that if quantum physics is non classical, it might
also allow us to do things which are not possible or at
least not feasible in classical world. As an example we
name here the SECOQC project.

III. BELL INEQUALITIES

Quantum mechanics predicts phenomena which are
counterintuitive to a classical understanding of our
world’s nature so much that respected physicists have
questioned how well the model represents actual physi-
cal reality (see Einstein, 1935). Bell inequalities provide
means to test some of the most counterintuitive predic-
tions of quantum mechanics. In order to understand how
Bell inequalities behave we discuss the concepts of com-
pleteness, locality and entanglement. Intuitive from our
experience we might expect that physical systems have
deﬁnite objective properties. However, any quantum me-
chanical model of a system cannot simultaneously de-
scribe deﬁnite values for all its physical properties, but
instead describes a weighted superposition of states. As
a matter of philosophy, one might choose to believe that
all properties of a system always have deﬁnite objective
values and thus that the theory of quantum mechanics is
incomplete in its inability to describe them. These def-
inite values could be described if we have knowledge of
some hidden variables (realist interpretation of quantum
mechanics). We can also believe that quantum mechan-
ics is a complete theory, so that there exists no hidden
variables in our system S, and that physical reality is
probabilistic rather than deterministic, known as ortho-
dox interpretation.
Based on intuition from classical mechanics and special
relativity we might expect physical reality to be local,
which means that the result of any measurement per-
formed by an experiment only depends on the values of
physical properties in the immediate space time vicinity
of measurement. If the outcomes of a measurement in
two distinct space and distinct in time locations can be
interdependent, then nature is alocal or non local.
Two systems are called entangled if they are distinct, if
they each exhibit superposition of states in some property
q, and if knowledge of q for the other particle is available.
As an example of entangled we can consider a neutral
pi meson that decays into a positron and an electron,
which ﬂy apart. The pion has spin 0 and the positron
and the electron each have a spin of magnitude 1
2 , by
consideration of angular momentum, measurement of the
z-components of the positron’s and electrons will be op-
posite. The orthodox interpretation of quantum mechan-
ics is that neither particle has a deﬁnite z-component of
spin before measurements take place. Each of it will be
in a superposition of spin states. However, when one is
measured and its z-component of spin is analysed, the z-
component of the other is immediately assumed a deﬁnite
direction. This interpretation clearly violates locality be-
cause the two particles can move arbitrarily far apart
before measurement. If one adopts the realist position,
then clearly the particles have deﬁnite z-components of
spin from the moment they come to existence at the same
point in space-time, and entanglement does not contra-
dict locality. Bell’s theorem shows that any local hidden
variable theory is incompatible with quantum mechan-

5

ics and this disagreements can be tested experimentally.
Results from such experiments closely follow quantum
mechanical predictions and violate the Bell inequalities.
This shows that our nature cannot be local, regardless
of whether the realist or orthodox interpretation is more
accurate.

A. Bell’s inequalities

In quantum mechanics properties of objects are not
clear to verify. They are only well deﬁned if we per-
form a measurement. Two quantum particles that are
interacting with each other, the possibility of predicting
properties without measurement on either side led to the
EPR paradox. The postulation of unknown random vari-
ables, hidden variables, would restore localism. On the
other hand, randomness is intrinsic to quantum mechan-
ics.
Bell implemented an experiment that would prove it
properties are well-deﬁned or not, an experiment that
would give one result if quantum mechanics is correct
and another result if hidden variables are needed. The
most important are Bell’s original inequality (Bell, 1964),
and the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality
(Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt 1969). In Bell’s work:

“Theoretical physicists live in a classical world, looking
out into a quantum-mechanical world. The latter we
describe only subjectively,
in terms of procedures and
results in our classical domain. (...) Now nobody knows
just where the boundary between the classical and the
quantum domain is situated. (...) More plausible to me
is that we will ﬁnd that there is no boundary. The wave
functions would prove to be a provisional or incomplete
It is this
description of the quantum-mechanical part.

possibility, of a homogeneous account of
which is for me the chief motivation of the study of the
so-called “hidden variable” possibility.
(...) A second motivation is connected with the statistical
character of quantum-mechanical predictions. Once the
the wave function description is
incompleteness of
suspected, it can be conjectured that random statistical
ﬂuctuations are determined by the extra “hidden”
variables – “hidden” because at this stage we can only
conjecture their existence and certainly cannot control
them.
(...) A third motivation is in the peculiar character
of some quantum-mechanical predictions, which seem
almost to cry out for a hidden variable interpretation.
This is the famous argument of Einstein, Podolsky
and Rosen.
(...) We will ﬁnd, in fact, that no local
deterministic hidden-variable theory can reproduce all
the experimental predictions of quantum mechanics.
This opens the possibility of bringing the question into
the experimental domain, by trying to approximate as
well as possible the idealized situations in which local
hidden variables and quantum mechanics cannot agree.”

a must yield

We will discuss the development of the Bell’s origi-
nal inequality. With the example advocated by Bohm
and Aharonov (1957), the EPR argument is the follow-
ing. Let us consider a pair of spin one-half particles in a
singlet state, and we place Stern-Gerlach magnets in or-
der to measure selected components of the spins σ1 and
a, with a
σ2. If the measurement of the component σ1
being some unit vector (observable a), yields +1, then
the quantum mechanics says that measurement of the
component σ2
1 and vice versa, because
the two particles are anticorrelated. Easily seen one can
predict in advance the result of measuring any chosen
component of σ2, by previously measuring the same com-
ponent of σ1.
Now let us construct a classical description of these cor-
relations. Suppose that there exist a continuous hidden
variable λ. The corresponding outcomes of measuring
1,
σ1
respectively. The main assumption is that result B for
particle two is independent of the setting a, nor A on
b, in other words, we address individual particles locally.

uct of the two components σ1

These inequalities can be tested experimentally by using
random counts. Pairs of particles are emitted as a re-
sult of a quantum process, and further analysed and de-
tected. In practice perfect anti correlations are diﬃcult
to obtain. Moreover, the system is always coupled to an
environment. Although several experiments validate the
quantum-mechanical view, the issue is not conclusively
settled.

B. Example for Bell Inequalities

The following example (Mermin, 1985) illustrates and
make the nature of Bell inequalities easy to understand.
Let us consider a particle with a slippery shape property
that is either square or round, depending on which way
we look at it. The particle cannot be seen from two di-
rections at once, and looking at it changes how it might
have looked from other directions. A source creates en-
tangled pairs of these particles, so that if we look at the
two from the same angle they have the same shape, and
sends them in opposite directions. Shape detectors inde-
pendent of each other and of the source are placed in the
path of each particle and randomly change between three
observing angles after the particles are emitted. Because
the particles are entangled, the detectors report the same
shape every time they happen to measure a pair from the
same observation angle. Additionally the detectors mea-
sure the same shape for half of all runs when they are set
arbitrarily and independently to one of the three angles.
This last property does hold for some real systems, and
is the key Bell found to show the existence of alocality.
In an eﬀort to construct a model for this situation which
is local in nature, we must assume that the information
for shape appearance at each angle is carried on the par-
ticles. This is the only local way to ensure that the same
shape is measured every time the detector angles hap-
pen to be the same. We can represent this information
by either a s (for square) or r (for round) in three slots
corresponding to the three detector angles. Remember
that the shape is slippery; we can only observe the shape
from one angle at a time, and subsequent measurement

will not reﬂect what the shape ”would have been” from
another angle. Thus we can learn only two of the three
pieces of information by measurement, one from each par-
ticle. The third number in each particle’s instruction
set is an unknowable, hidden variable. Suppose a pair
of entangled particles which look square from angles 1
and 2 and round from angle 3 each carry the instruc-
tion set ssr. For this particular instruction set, there are
ﬁve possible detector settings which yield the same shape
(11, 22, 33, 12, 21) and four settings which yield diﬀerent
shapes (13, 23, 32, 31), so the probability of detecting the
same shape given this instruction set is 5
9 . There are ﬁve
more possible instruction sets that also give probability 5
9
for detecting the same shape. These are rss, srs, rrs, rsr
and srr. The only other possible instruction sets are rrr
and sss, for which the same shape is measured with prob-
ability 1. Whatever the distribution of these instruction
sets among the entangled pairs, the detectors will mea-
sure the same shape in at least 5
9 of all runs.
5
The inequality P
9 , where P is the proportion over all
runs that the detectors measure the same shape, is a Bell
inequality for this particular local hidden variable model.
However, one of the required features of any model is that
it allows the observed behavior, that the same shape is
observed in only half of all runs. Our inequality is vi-
5
olated; P = 1
9 , so our local hidden variable model
does not adequately describe the system.
It is worth noting that this system can be created phys-
ically with spin-entangled electron/positron pairs sub-
stituted for the shape-entangled particles, and Stern-
Gerlach analyzers substituted for shape detectors. The
proper three angles to give P = 1
2 are 0◦, 120◦ and 240◦.
The analog for a polarization entangled photon system
is polarization detectors at angles 0◦, 60◦ and 120◦ but
because the linear polarizers only pass the vertical polar-
ization of its rotated basis, measurements must be taken
at the orthogonal angles as well.

IV. SCHR ¨ODINGER’S VERSCHR ¨ANKUNG

Shortly after Bohr’s reply to EPR paper on the in-
completeness of quantum theory, Schr¨odinger published
a response to EPR in which he introduced the notion of
’entanglement’ to describe such quantum correlations. In
his view that entanglement was the essence of quantum
mechanics and that it illustrates the diﬀerence between
the quantum and classical worlds in the most pronounced
way. Schr¨odinger realized that the members of an entan-
gled collection of objects do not have their own individ-
ual quantum states. Only the collection as a whole has
a well-deﬁned state.
In quantum mechanics we can prepare two particles in
such a way that the correlations between them cannot
be explained classically, in the sense that the nature of
the correlations we are interested in does not correspond
to the statistics of the particles. Such quantum states
are called ’entangled’ states.

7

With the formulation of Bell inequalities and their ex-
perimental violation, it seemed that the question of non-
locality in quantum mechanics had been settled once for
all.
In last years the literature has discussed that this
conclusion was a bit to early. Entanglement in mixed
quantum states presents special features not shown when
dealing with pure quantum states, to the point that a
mixed quantum state ρ does not violate Bell inequalities,
but can nevertheless reveal quantum mechanical correla-
tions (Werner, 1989).
The motivation of quantum entanglement has following
motivations: It plays an essential role in several counter-
intuitive consequences of quantum mechanics, is a chal-
lenging problem of quantum mechanics, a role in quan-
tum information theory and quantum computation. En-
tanglement, together with quantum parallelism is the
heart of quantum computing. In spite of over 100 years of
quantum theory with great achievements, we still know
very little about nature.

V. ERWIN SCHR ¨ODINGER’S GHOST CAT

(1935)

famous

Schr¨odinger

introduced his

cat.
Schr¨odinger devised his cat experiment in an attempt to
illustrate the incompleteness of the theory of quantum
mechanics when going from subatomic to macroscopic
systems. Schr¨odinger’s legendary cat was doomed to be
killed by an automatic device triggered by the decay of a
radioactive atom. He thought that it could be both dead
and alive. A strange superposition of

was conceived. But the wavefunction (9) showed no such
commitment, superposing the probabilities. Either the
wavefunction (9), as given by the Schr¨odinger equation,
was not everything, or it was not right.
The Schr¨odinger’s cat puzzle deals with the superposi-
are two states, quantum

and
tion principle.
|
mechanics tells us that the linear combination a
1
i
|
is also a possible state. Whereas such superpositions of
states have been extensively veriﬁed for microscopic sys-
tems, the application of the formalism to macroscopic
systems appears to lead immediately to hard problems
in our understanding of the world. Neither has a book
ever observed to be in a superposition of macroscopically
distinguishable positions, nor seems our Schr¨odinger cat
that is a superposition of being alive and dead to bear
much resemblance to reality as we perceive it. The prob-
lem is then how to reconcile the range of the Hilbert space
of possible states with the observation of a comparably
few “classical” macroscopic states.
The long standing puzzle of the Schr¨odinger’s cat prob-
lem has been largely resolved in terms of quantum deco-
herence.

The well-known phenomenon of quantum entanglement
had demonstrated that correlations between systems can
lead to counterintuitive properties of the composite sys-
tem that cannot be composed from the properties of the
individual systems. It is the great merit of decoherence
to have emphasized the ubiquity and essential inescapa-
bility of system environment correlations.
The Schr¨odinger cat points out the paradoxes of playing
quantum games with macroscopic objects. For quantum
systems, even at mesoscopic scales, decoherence presents
a formidable drawback to the maintenance of quantum
coherence, which is the main drawback in the physical im-
plementation of quantum computing. Decoherence typi-
cally takes place on extremely short time scales. In gen-
eral, the eﬀect of decoherence increases with the size of
the system, but it is important to note that there exist,
admittedly somewhat exotic, examples where the deco-
hering inﬂuence of the environment can be suﬃciently
shielded as to lead to mesoscopic and even macroscopic
superpositions.

VI. QUANTUM INFORMATION THEORY

The theory of quantum information is a result of the
eﬀort to generalise classical information theory to the
quantum world. Quantum information theory aims to
answer the following question:

What happens if information is stored in a
state of a quantum system?

It is a strength of classical information theory that it does
not need to ask the question about the physical repre-
sentation of information: There is no need for a ’ink-on-
paper’ information theory or a ’DVD information’ theory.
This is due to that fact that it is always possible to ef-
ﬁciently transform information from one representation
to another representation. For this reason, one might
be tempted to believe that it is not important whether
information is stored in classical systems or in quantum
systems. However this is not the case:
it is not possi-
ble, for example, to write down the previously unknown
information contained in the polarisation of a photon of
ink on a paper. In general quantum mechanics does not
allow us to read out the state of an quantum system
with arbitrary precision. The existence of Bell correla-
tions between quantum systems cannot be converted into
classical information. It is possible to transform quan-
tum information between quantum systems of suﬃcient
quantum information capacity. The quantum informa-
tion content of a quantum message
can for this rea-
son be measured in therms of the minimum number n of
two-level systems which are needed to store the message:

M

consists of n qubits.

M
In its original quantum information theoretical sense, the
term qubit is thus a measure for the amount of informa-
tion. A two-level quantum system can carry at most one
qubit, in the same sense a classical binary digit can carry

8

at most one classical bit. The term qubit is used as a
synonym for a two-level quantum system.
A pure one qubit state is speciﬁed by two real parame-
ters, in this sense quantum information is similar to ana-
log (in contrast to digital) classical information. Ana-
log information processing seems to be much more eﬃ-
cient than digital information processing on a ﬁrst sight,
since an analog information carrier could contain an inﬁ-
nite amount of information. However, analog information
processing is being, or is already been, replaced by digi-
tal information processing. From this one can see, that
in practise analog information processing performs more
than digital information processing.
In the presence of noise, which is responsible for this gap
between the theoretical promise and the practical appli-
In the case of noise, the
cation of analog information.
information content of an analog information carrier is
no longer inﬁnite, but ﬁnite. This is a consequence of
Shannon’s noisy coding theorem. It is very diﬃcult to
protect the remaining ﬁnite information content of ana-
log information carriers against noise. The example of
classical analog information shows that quantum infor-
mation processing schemes must necessary be tolerant
against noise, otherwise there would be a chance for them
to be useful. It was a big break through for the theory
of quantum information, when quantum error correction
codes and fault-tolerant quantum computation schemes
were discovered.

VII. ENTROPY WITH CONNECTION TO VON
NEUMANN

John von Neumann contributed rigorously to estab-
lish the correct mathematical framework for quantum
mechanics with his work Mathematische Grundlagen der
Quantenmechanik. He provided in this work a theory of
measurement, where the usual notion of wave collapse
is described as an irreversible process (the so called von
Neumann or projective measurement).
The density matrix was introduced, with diﬀerent mo-
tivations, by von Neumann and by Landau. The moti-
vation that led Landau was the impossibility to describe
a subsystem of a composite quantum system by a state
vector. On the other hand, von Neumann introduced the
density matrix in order to develop both quantum statis-
tical mechanics and a theory of quantum measurements.
Ideas and methods from information theory are useful in
the study of the probability distributions appearing in
quantum mechanics. Probabilities in quantum mechan-
ics arise in two diﬀerent ways. On the one hand, we have

orthogonal. Here the statistical operator ˆρ describes a
mixed quantum state associated with an incoherent mix-
ture of states where each (pure) state
appears with
probability pi. A quantum mechanical statistical opera-
tor diﬀers in fundamental ways from a classical probabil-
ity distribution. Nevertheless, the second kind of prob-
ability distributions described above have some similari-
ties with the standard probability distributions describ-
ing classical statistical ensembles (Sakurai, 1985). On
the contrary, the ﬁrst kind of probabilities, associated
with pure states, are essentially quantum mechanical in
nature and have no classical counterpart.
The density matrix formalism was developed to extend
the tools of classical statistical mechanics to the quan-
tum domain. In the classical framework we compute the
partition function of the system in order to evaluate all
possible thermodynamic quantities. Von Neumann in-
troduced the density matrix in a context of states and
operators in a Hilbert space. The knowledge of the sta-
tistical density matrix operator would allow us to com-
pute all average quantities in a conceptually similar, but
mathematically diﬀerent way. Let us suppose we have a
set of wave functions
which depend parametrically
on a set of quantum numbers n1, n2, ..., nN . The natu-
ral variable which we have is the amplitude with which
a particular wavefunction of the basic set participates in
the actual wavefunction of the system. Let us denote the
square of this amplitude by p(n1, n2, ..., nN ). The goal is
to make this quantity p to the classical density function
in phase space. We have to veriﬁes that p goes over into
the density function in the classical limit and that it has
ergodic properties. After checking that p(n1, n2, ..., nN )
is a constant of motion, an ergodic assumption for the
probabilities p(n1, n2, ..., nN ) makes p a function of the
energy only .
After this procedure, one ﬁnally arrives to the den-
sity matrix formalism when seeking a form where
p(n1, n2, ..., nN ) is invariant with respect to the represen-
tation used. In the form it is written, it will only yield the
correct expectation values for quantities which are diag-
onal with respect to the quantum numbers n1, n2, ..., nN .
Expectation values of operators which are not diagonal
involve the phases of the quantum amplitudes. Suppose
we subsume the quantum numbers n1, n2, ..., nN by the
single index i or j. Then our wave function has the form

The invariance of (16) is described by matrix theory. We
described a mathematical framework where the expecta-
tion of quantum operators, as described by matrices, is
obtained by tracing the product of the density operator
ˆρ times an operator ˆB (Hilbert scalar product between
operators). The matrix formalism here is in the statisti-
cal mechanics framework, although it applies as well for
ﬁnite quantum systems, which is usually the case, where
the state of the system cannot be described by a pure
state, but as a statistical operator ˆρ of the form (12).
Mathematically, ˆρ is a positive, semideﬁnite hermitian
matrix with unit trace.
Given the density matrix ρ, von Neumann deﬁned the
entropy as

S(ρ) =

Tr(ρ lnρ),

(17)

−
which is a proper extension of Shannon’s entropy to the
quantum case. To compute (17) one has to ﬁnd a basis
in which ρ possesses a diagonal representation. We note
that the entropy S(ρ) times the Boltzmann constant kB
equals the thermodynamical or physical entropy. If the
system is ﬁnite (ﬁnite dimensional matrix representation)
the entropy (17) describes the departure of our system
from a pure state. In other words, it measures the degree
of mixture of our state describing a given ﬁnite system.
Properties of the von Neumann entropy

1. S(ρ) is only zero for pure states.

2. S(ρ) is maximal and equal to lnN for a maximally
mixed state, N being the dimension of the Hilbert
space.

3. S(ρ) is invariant under changes in the basis of ρ,
that is, S(ρ) = S(U ρ U †), with U a unitary trans-
formation.

4. S(ρ) is concave, that is, given a collection of posi-
tive numbers λi and density operators ρi, we have

This property is known as subadditivity. While in
Shannon’s theory the entropy of a composite sys-
tem can never be lower than the entropy of any of
its parts, in quantum theory this is not the case.
Actually, this can be seen as an indicator of an en-
tangled state ρAB.

6. The von Neumann entropy (17) is strongly subad-

ditive:

S(ρABC ) + S(ρB)

S(ρAB) + S(ρBC ).

The von Neumann entropy is being extensively used in
diﬀerent forms (conditional entropies, relative entropies,
etc.) in all the framework of quantum information theory.
Entanglement measures are based upon some quantity
directly related to the von Neumann entropy. However,
there have appeared in the literature several papers deal-
ing with the possible inadequacy of the Shannon informa-
tion, and consequently of the von Neumann entropy as an
appropriate quantum generalization of Shannon entropy.
The main argument is that in classical measurement the
Shannon information is a natural measure of our igno-
rance about the properties of a system, whose existence is
independent of measurement. Conversely, quantum mea-
surement cannot be claimed to reveal the properties of a
system that existed before the measurement was made.
This controversy have encouraged some authors to in-
troduce the non-additivity property of Tsallis’ entropy
as the main reason for recovering a true quantal infor-
mation measure in the quantum context, claiming that
non-local correlations ought to be described because of
the particularity of Tsallis’ entropy.

Presented at the Meeting ”Scientiﬁc Cooperation between Italy and Developing Countries: The Program
TRIL-ICTP”,
ENEA, Lungotevere Thaon de Revel 76, Roma, 10 March 2006.

Abstract

A brief recollection is made of the many scientiﬁc collaborations of Bologna with colleagues
In particular are discussed in detail the collaborations in some recent

from Developing Countries.
AstroparticlePhysics Experiments.

1 Introduction

Immediately after World War 2 the list of Developing Countries included also Japan and
several European Nations. During this period, relatively small experiments were made
in fundamental High Energy Physics, mainly in the US and later at CERN. In many of
these experiments there were young physicists from “Developing Countries”, mainly on
an individual basis [1-5]. But soon after larger Collaborations started and some were
oﬃcially formalized, like the CERN-Serpukhov Collaboration [3], several bubble chamber
collaborations and experiments at the new CERN facilities [6-9].

It was during this period of time that Italy started to have medium-large facilities and
that ICTP started scientiﬁc programs, like the TRIL program (Training and Research in
Italian Laboratories). ICTP had always organized Summer Schools, but during this period
their number increased considerably and some of the subjects of the School became more
technical and more experimental. And it was always a pleasure to have lunch in the ICTP
cafeteria with Abdus Salam, the Director and founder of ICTP, and Giuseppe Furlan, the
leader of the TRIL program.

Later the Italian National Institutes (INFN, ENEA, CNR,

started to provide
funds FAI, for international visitors. And the University of Bologna, like other Italian
Universities, started to have Internationalization Programs which involved also many
Developing Nations. Several agreements were signed between Universities and also between
Institutes/Departments.

...)

In Bologna we started having long visits of colleagues from Bolivia, Brazil, India Mali,
Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, Romania and Syria, and shorter visits of colleagues from Algeria,
Colombia, India, Japan, Morocco, Russia, Spain and several other Nations. Our group had
in Bologna at any moment a couple of visitors for long stages and a couple of visitors for
relatively short visits. And some research groups from Morocco, Romania, Mali started to
participate oﬃcially in large non accelerator astroparticle physics experiments, mainly at
the Gran Sasso National Laboratories [10-14] and also in other places [15-18].

2 Scientiﬁc ﬁelds

Early scientiﬁc experimental collaborations concerned experiments at small and large
accelerators, mainly in the ﬁeld of hadron-hadron collisions [1, 5, 7]. They were performed
to study the low energy parameters of pion-nucleon scattering, to search for resonances and
threshold phenomena in relatively low energy π±N, k±N, p±N total cross sections and in
π±A absorption cross sections. At larger energies a topic of great interest was the discovery
of the rising of the total hadron-hadron cross sections, ﬁrst K +p at Serpukhov [3] and those
of the other cross sections at CERN and at Fermilab [4, 5]; other topics of interest were
low pt and high pt particle production. Large bubble chamber experiments allowed to study
several ﬁelds, including resonance searches, studies of exotic channels, and neutrino-nucleon
deep inelastic scattering [7].

The more recent collaborations

involved Non Accelerator Astroparticle Physics
experiments, mainly performed at the Gran Sasso National Laboratories, but also at
high altitude laboratories. Some people and groups from Developing Nations participated
actively in the MACRO experiment at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory [10-14], in
the SLIM experiment at the Chacaltaya high altitude laboratory [16] and in the CAKE
balloon experiment [15].

In the largest experiments there was also involvement in Detector Development and
Construction [9, 12, 17, 18]. Detector development and use of these detectors to study also
environmental parameters was made, in particular in the collaborations with ENEA [19].

3 Theses, Summer Schools, Workshops

The agreements between the University of Bologna and Universities in Developing Countries
allowed many PhD theses to be performed, based on the results of common experiments,
like MACRO at the Gran Sasso Lab, SLIM at the Chacaltaya High Altitude Laboratory
in Bolivia and in the CAKE balloon experiment for the study of the primary Cosmic Ray
Composition. In the last 15 years a total of about 2 Laurea theses and 10 PhD theses were
made.

The involvement of Moroccan Colleagues in the MACRO experiment allowed to perform
from
a NATO-Advanced Research Workshop in Oujda, Morocco (“Cosmic Radations:
Astronomy to Particle Physics”) [20]. This allowed to get together about 50 physicists and
astrophysicists involved in non-accelerator astroparticle physics experiments in general and
in the ﬁeld of neutrino oscillations in particular. The participants were from 11 Nations. This
encouraged new relations and new cultural exchanges. Also many contacts were established
with Institutions from Mediterranean Countries. Also a ﬁrst small experiment was made to
measure for the ﬁrst time the radon contamination in the Oujda region (see ref. [20] page
325).

A series of 7 Schools on “Non Accelerator Astroparticle Physics” were held at the Trieste
Abdus Salam International Center for Theoretical Physics; the proceedings of the last four
Schools were published, usually by World Scientiﬁc Publishing, see for ex. the proceedings
of the 7th School [21]. Fig. 1 shows the beginning of a short report in the CERN Courier
on this 7th School [22]. Notice that about 80 students from 43 countries attended the last
School and about 16 renowned physicists lectured at the School.

4 Conclusions. Outlook

The ICTP programs have been very useful for young people from Developing Countries
and encouraged them to join the experiments performed in Italy, in CERN and in other
laboratories. Other ICTP programs also helped the young people, after their return in their
home Countries, to keep in touch with their European collaborators. Other programs, the
numerous summer schools, the books donation program, the transport contributions, etc.
have been also very important.

The ﬁnancial contribution from the FAI funds and from fellowships for foreigners by

INFN, ENEA, CNR and ASI, were also successfully used.

5 Acknowledgements

I would like to thank ICTP for their many programs which involve people from Developing
Countries and for organizing all sorts of Summer Schools. I thank ENEA, CNR and INFN
for providing funds FAI and fellowships for foreigners, and the University of Bologna for
making many collaborative agreements with Universities in Developing Countries. I thank
A. Casoni for typing this manuscript.

In the early collaborations I like to recall the colleagues Kozo Miyake from Japan, B. A. Leontic from
Yugoslavia, J. Derkaoui from Morocco, R. Sosnowsky and others from Poland, S. P. Denisov and others
from the USSR, J. Negret and others from Colombia, Hi Wang and others from China. For the more recent:
collaborations organized via ICTP, INFN, ENEA and the University of Bologna, I recall the colleagues

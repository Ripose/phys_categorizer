We investigate “shell structure” from Babylonian times: periodicities and beats in
computer-simulated lunar data corresponding to those observed by Babylonian scribes
some 2500 years ago. We discuss the mathematical similarity between the Babylonians’
recently reconstructed method of determining one of the periods of the moon with mod-
ern Fourier analysis and the interpretation of shell structure in ﬁnite fermion systems
(nuclei, metal clusters, quantum dots) in terms of classical closed or periodic orbits.

1. Introduction

Beats are an ubiquitous phenomenon arising from the interference of waves oscil-
lating with diﬀerent frequencies. In classical physics, they occur, e.g., in water or
sound waves. In microscopic physics, they appear as quantum oscillations occur-
ring, e.g., in the form of (super-) shell structure in ﬁnite fermion systems such as
atomic nuclei, metallic clusters or semiconductor quantum dots. But beating am-
plitudes occur also in coupled mechanical systems when the uncoupled subsystems
have nearly commensurable periods. One example – and perhaps the ﬁrst stud-
ied by mankind – is our planetary system including the earth’s moon. In fact, the
system sun-earth-moon represents the oldest three-body problem,1 which has oc-
cupied astronomers since more than 3000 years and until today, despite all our
modern mathematical knowledge, is not exactly solvable.

As an illustration of the similarity of beats occurring on astronomical and mi-
croscopic scales, we juxtapose in Fig. 1 some lunar data, computer simulated for
the time around 500 B.C. in Babylon, with shell structure of a modern meso-
scopic quantum-mechanical system. On the left side, we show the quantity Σ =
ˇS ´U+NA+ME+GE6, from which the Babylonians are thought2 to have derived one
of the periods of the moon (as discussed in Sect. 3.1 below), calculated as a function

of the lunation number L that counts the oppositions of moon and sun. On the
right side of Fig. 1, we show the energy shell correction δE of a two-dimensional
semiconductor quantum dot with a radius of a few hundred nanometers,3 calculated
as a function of the number N of conduction electrons contained in the dot (which
was modeled here by a circular billiard).

In Sect. 2 we brieﬂy discuss those lunar phenomena which were observed by the
Babylonians and recorded on clay tablets. In Sect. 3 we give a short account of
our present understanding, making use of modern computer simulations of the lu-
nar data, of some of the methods by which the Babylonians arrived at their precise
knowledge of the periods of the sun and the moon. In Sect. 4 we analyse their deter-
mination of the lunar period by applying modern Fourier analysis. This technique
is also successfully used in the semiclassical description of quantum oscillations in
terms of classical closed (periodic) orbits,4,5,6,7 which has had a substantial impact
on recent research on quantum chaos.8

2. Observation and theory of lunar phenomena from Babylon

The Babylonian astronomy focused on special phenomena. In case of the moon,
these were eclipses and some ocurrences around conjunction (new moon, i.e., sun
and moon have the same ecliptical longitude) and opposition (full moon: the elon-
gation of the moon from the sun equals 180◦). In case of the planets they were, e.g.,
the ﬁrst and last visibility.

The so-called Babylonian mathematical astronomy, which was fully developed
around 300 B.C., enabled the scribes to calculate positions and times of these
special phases. They did, however, not consider them as functions of a continuous
time variable, but they calculated a series of discrete phases along the path of
the celestial body in question. For the moon they recorded times and positions of
consecutive conjunctions or oppositions, labeled by the names of the months during
which they occurred.

2.1. The period of the lunar velocity

The new Babylonian month started on the evening when the crescent moon became
visible for the ﬁrst time after conjunction. The time interval NAN from sunset until
moonset on that evening was observed. This quantity is quite obvious and easy to
observe. However, from a theoretical point of view, it is very complicated. It de-
pends on the velocity v$ of the moon, its longitude λ$ (position in the ecliptic),
its latitude β$ (distance from the ecliptic), and on the time interval ∆t from con-
junction to sunset. It is an impressing achievement of the Babylonian scribes that
they were able to develop very elegant numerical systems capable of calculating
NAN for consecutive new moons, taking all the variables into account. The values
of NAN were listed in so-called lunar ephemerides for each month. (Similarly, in
the modern computer simulations discussed in Sect. 3 below, we present the data
as functions of the lunation number L counting the full moons.) At least since O.
Neugebauer9 we know how the ephemerides were calculated; but we have still rather
little knowledge about how this theory was derived from observations.

One big question was how the period T$ of the lunar velocity was found. The
movement of the moon is very irregular: it keeps changing phase and latitude and
can have its maximal velocity anywhere on the ecliptic. Which kind of observations
did the Babylonians use? In lunar ephemerides concerned with conjunctions, the
calculated values of the lunar velocity for successive new moons are given in a
column called F. But these values are all derived from a linear zig-zag function, given
in a column Φ appearing directly after the ﬁrst column containing the names of the
months. Therefore we must assume that Φ, rather than F, was constructed from
observations. Their common period is PΦ = 6247/448 = 13.94420 synodic months,
which is surprisingly accurate. PΦ is the mean period of the lunar velocity measured
on the days of conjunction (or at oppositions for the full-moon ephemerides). Let
P$be the period of the lunar velocity, measured from day to day. The value of PΦ
corresponds to the period P$ = 6247/6695 synodic months = 27.55453 days. The
presently known value, calculated for Babylonian times, is 27.55455 days.

Column Φ was long supposed to be based on lunar eclipses which were of great
importance in Mesopotamia and had been observed since early times. However,
the Babylonian observational records of moon eclipses were too inaccurate to allow
for their accurate value of PΦ. Therefore it has been postulated2 that some other
observations were used to construct Φ – namely those of some short time intervals
around full moons.

2.2. The Lunar Four

Since 747 B.C., celestial phenomena were observed regularly and recorded month
after month in the so-called Diaries.10 The astronomical observations conducted in
Mesopotamia may be called the longest scientiﬁc project ever. Diaries were pro-
duced continuously during a period of almost 700 years - the latest Diary found so
far stems from the year 61 B.C. They were written in cuneiform on clay tablets: for

10th Nuclear Physics Workshop, 24-28 September 2003, Kazimierz Dolny (Poland)

4 L. Brack-Bernsen and M. Brack

each month of the year lunar phases, eclipses and planetary phases were recorded
together with market prices, weather observations and historical events. In the ear-
liest Diaries only the days of the special lunar phases were recorded.

However, starting at least back in the 6th century B.C., the Babylonians began
to regularly observe the times between the risings and settings of sun and moon in
the days around opposition and record the measured times. (The oldest preserved
Diary in which NA is mentioned stems from the year 568 B.C.) The following four
special time intervals relating to the full moon, the so-called “Lunar Four”, were
observed and recorded:

ˇS ´U = time from moonset to sunrise measured at last moonset before sunrise,
NA = time from sunrise to moonset measured at ﬁrst moonset after sunrise,
ME = time from moonrise to sunset measured at last moonrise before sunset,
GE6 = time from sunset to moonrise measured at ﬁrst moonrise after sunset.
These time intervals were measured in uˇs = time degrees (1 day = 380◦), and since
they were rather short (< 20◦ = 80 minutes), they could be measured much more
accurately than the times of eclipses. Therefore, Lunar Four data may be much
better candidates for the reconstruction of Φ than eclipse observations. However,
these intervals – all of them being similar to NAN – are very complicated functions
of the lunar velocity, its longitude and latitude, and of the time from opposition to
sunrise: ˇS ´U = ˇS ´U(v$,λ$,β$,∆t), etc. Was it possible for the Babylonians to extract
information on v$ from these beating functions, i.e., to ﬁnd PΦ?

From cuneiform tablets it is known that the Babylonians did observe the Lunar
Four with quite some accuracy. But since only about 5% of all diaries have been
found until now, there are large gaps in the recorded data. It is not possible to
extract a suﬃcient amount of Lunar Four data to check exactly what information
they contain. Therefore, it is of great help to simulate the Lunar Four data by means
of a computer code for lunar ephemerides, as will be discussed in the following
section. Since we thereby are concerned mainly with the partial sums ˇS ´U+NA and
ME+GE6 of the Lunar Four, it is necessary to brieﬂy mention their astronomical
signiﬁcance.11,12 On the last morning before opposition, the moon sets ˇS ´U degrees
before sunrise and on the next morning, it sets NA degrees after sunrise. We see
that during the day of opposition, in comparison to sunrise, the setting moon on
the western horizon is retarded by the amount ˇS ´U+NA. Similar arguments show
that ME+GE6, observed on the eastern horizon, is the retardation of the rising
moon during the day of opposition.

3. Modern simulations of old observations

For our computer simulations of lunar observables at ancient Babylonian times,
we used a code developed by S. Moshier,13 which employes a semi-analytical lunar
ephemeris adequate for historical times.14 From the risings and settings of sun and
moon, evaluated at the days around the oppositions, we computed the Lunar Four
and tabulated them as functions of the lunation number L.

3.1. The origin of column Φ

Using such calculated Lunar Four data and the simple idea that observations in the
east should be combined with observations in the west, it was found2 that the sum
of all Lunar Four, Σ = ˇS ´U+NA+ME+GE6, yields oscillations with the period T$
that can be ﬁtted by the linear zig-zag function recorded in column Φ. In Fig. 2,
we show the curve Σ(L) by crosses, connected with thick lines. The thin dashed
100◦. It yields an optimal ﬁt to
line is the function Φ(L), shifted by an amount
the calculated function Σ(L). It overshoots the extrema of Σ(L) but reproduces its
T$. Note that the
main oscillations yielding, in particular the correct period PΦ
phase of Σ(L) (i.e., its position along the L axis) was not adjusted, but obtained
directly from the calculated ephemerides appropriate for the time span covered by
the data on the cuneiform tablet LBAT 1285 (indicated by a horizontal bar in
100◦, whose
the ﬁgure). The only adjusted parameter here is the vertical shift of
origin and signiﬁcance have remained unclear so far.

Φ − 100◦. The horizontal bar covers the time span of the data on the table LBAT 1285.

In Sect. 4.2 we will use Fourier analysis to illustrate that the period PΦ can be
extracted from a ﬁt to the function Σ(L), but not to any of the single Lunar Four,
nor to the partial sums (ˇS ´U+NA)(L) or (ME+GE6)(L).

The conclusion is therefore nearlying that we have found the observational origin
of the column Φ from which all data related to the lunar velocity were derived. The
hypothesis that Φ was constructed from the combination Σ of lunar observables is
theoretically well supported11,12 by the astronomical signiﬁcance of Σ.

In order to support this hypothesis with historical evidence, it must be shown
that the Babylonians really did collect Lunar Four data of consecutive months, and
that the accuracy of these data was suﬃcient.

3.2. Ancient observations compared with computer-simulated data
A special type of tablets, the Goal-Year tablets,15 collect lunar and planetary data
to be used for astronomical predictions in a special year, the “goal year”. A Goal-
Year tablet for the year Y records all Lunar Four intervals from the year Y
18
together with the eclipses that took place (or were expected to occur) during the
18. It also lists the sums ˇS ´U+NA and ME+GE6 for the last six months

of year Y
19. The Babylonians have thus, indeed, recorded the Lunar Four data
continuously, and we can test their accuracy by modern simulations.

In Fig. 3 we plot the Babylonian data recorded on the Goal-Year tablet LBAT
1285 (circles and dashed lines) and compare them with the computer-simulated
values (crosses and solid lines). Although the single Lunar Four behave rather ir-
regularly, the agreement between old observations and modern calculations is very
good, considering the fact that no adjustable parameter has been used. Especially
important is the fact that the recorded values of the partial sums ˇS ´U+NA and
ME+GE6 lie very close to the computer-simulated curves and reﬂect even some of
their ﬁne structure. Similar agreement could be found with data recorded on many
other tablets, one of them dating back to the times of Cambyses (523 B.C.).16

We have thus clear historical evidence that the Babylonians did record the Lunar
Four regularly over several hundred years and, in particular, paid attention also to
their partial sums ˇS ´U+NA and ME+GE6. The accuracy of these recorded data is
suﬃcient to support the hypothesis that the lunar period PΦ could be extracted
from their sum Σ.

3.3. The Goal-Year method for predictions

What if some Lunar Four data could not be observed because of bad weather or
some other reason? There must have been ways to reconstruct or predict them.

be visible in Babylon if it takes place during the night when the moon is above the
horizon. We can thus easily understand that the eclipse data on the tablet for the
Goal-Year Y could be used for predicting eclipses in the year Y . But the question
arises: how and to what purpose were the recorded Lunar Four data of 1 Saros
ago used? Fig. 4 helps us to answer this question. Over a period of 30 months,
the functions NA(L), (ˇS ´U+NA)(L), and (ME+GE6)(L) are compared here with
their respective values 223 months earlier. The sums ˇS ´U+NA and ME+GE6 repeat
themselves nicely after 1 Saros. This is not too surprising since 1 Saros, in a good
approximation, equals an integer number of periods of v$, λ$ and β$. However,
NA(L) (taken as a representative of all single Lunar Four) behaves very irregularly
and there seems to be no simple connection between NA(L) and NA(L

223).

It is, nevertheless, possible to predict single Lunar Four data by means of
Goal-Year data. The knowledge that (ˇS ´U+NA)(L) = (ˇS ´U+NA)(L
223) and
(ME+GE6)(L) = (ME+GE6)(L
223) can be combined with our knowledge that
the three variables v$, λ$, and β$ will have approximately the same magnitudes
at two oppositions OL and OL−223, situated one Saros apart. The only variable de-
termining the Lunar Four which has changed after one Saros is the time at which
opposition takes place: 1 Saros = 223 synodic months = 6585 + 1/3 days. The
time of opposition, compared to sunrise and sunset, is shifted by 1/3 day. These
considerations led to the following proposal17 how the Goal-Year tablets could be
used for predicting the Lunar Four by what we call the “Goal-Year method”:

−

˘S ´U (L) = ˘S ´U (L
NA(L) = NA(L

ME(L) = ME(L

The shift of 1/3 day in the time of opposition lets ˇS ´U(L) become 1/3 (ˇS ´U+NA)
larger than ˇS ´U(L
223), while NA is reduced by the same amount. The quantity
ˇS ´U+NA measures the retardation of the setting moon during the day of opposition.
The correction of ˇS ´U and NA by one third of this quantity therefore takes into
account the retardation of the moon after 1 Saros.

−

The cuneiform tablet TU 11, which contains astrological as well as astronomical
sections (at the time the two were not distinguished), nicely comﬁrms the Goal-
Year method. In section 16 of TU 11 we ﬁnd parts of the equations above spelled
out in words.18 This proves that the Babylonians had, indeed, found and used the
above relations for the prediction of Lunar Four time intervals.

What is impressing with the Goal-Year method is that it is easy, elegant and
surprisingly precise. In Fig. 5 we illustrate the accuracy of the method by comparing
calculated values of ˇS ´U(L) with those predicted according to the right-hand side of
the ﬁrst equation above.

4. Fourier analysis of shell structure

To unravel the origin of beats, one can apply the technique of Fourier analysis:
by Fourier transforming the ocillating data with respect to a suitable variable (e.g.
energy or wave number), one obtains a spectrum (e.g. of periods or orbit lenghts) of
the interfering sources. As mentioned in the introduction, this tool is employed also
in the study of quantum chaos in order to establish the semiclassical correspondence
of quantum mechanics and classical mechanics. We ﬁrst give two examples of such
analyses from atomic and cluster physics and then apply the Fourier analysis to
the Babylonian lunar observables. (Further examples relevant for nuclear physics
are given by Arita in this volume.19)

4.1. Examples of modern spectra

When hydrogen atoms are put into strong magnetic ﬁelds, their electronic motion
becomes classically chaotic. A – by now famous – semiclassical analysis of pho-
toionization energy spectra of hydrogen in magnetic ﬁelds by Holle et al.,20 using
an extension of the periodic orbit theory of Gutzwiller,4 established the one-to-one
correspondence of strong Fourier peaks with closed classical orbits of the electron,
as shown in Fig. 6. (See Ref.20 for the scaling variable γ which depends on both
energy and magnetic ﬁeld strength.)

Fig. 6. Left: Scaled photoionization energy spectrum of hydrogen in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. Right:
Its Fourier transform. The peaks correspond to the shown classical closed orbits of the electron.20

A textbook example6 of a classically integrable system without chaos is shown
in Fig. 7, where we display the coarse-grained level density of a three-dimensional
spherical quantum billiard as a function of the wave number k = √2mE/~, Gauss-
ian-averaged over a range ∆k = 0.4/R in order to emphasize the gross-shell struc-
ture. Its Fourier transform exhibits the length spectrum of the shortest classical
periodic orbits contributing at this level of resolution, whose shapes are polygons
with n corners (the number n is given near the Fourier peaks in the ﬁgure). We see
that the quantum beats in δg(k) are mainly due to the triangles and squares (and,
with less weight, pentagons etc.; see Ref.6 for details). Although this appears to be
a rather naive toy model, it is realistic enough to describe the supershell structure

4.2. Fourier Analysis of Babylonian observables

The three-body system sun-earth-moon is not integrable, but it is – luckily – not
chaotic. We refer to a recent review by Gutzwiller1 for an account of the various
levels of sophistication at which it has been treated over the last two millenia, and
for the basic periods of the sun and the moon (as observed from the earth) which
govern its observables. As we have already mentioned in Sect. 2, the Babylonians
were able to extract the period T$of the lunar velocity by a suitable combination of
observations on the western and eastern horizon. In the following we shall illustrate
their procedure with the help of Fourier transforms.

In Fig. 8 we show on the upper left side two characteristic observables recorded
by the Babylonians, ˇS ´U and ˇS ´U+NA, plotted versus the lunation number L count-
ing the successive oppositions of sun and moon. On the right side we present their
Fourier transforms with respect to L, which yield the spectra of periods T responsi-
ble for the oscillations and beats in these observables. All of the “Lunar Four” ˇS ´U,
NA, GE6 and ME deﬁned in Sect. 2.2 appear as rather erratic functions of L yielding
similar, relatively noisy Fourier spectra (we show here only the quantity ˇS ´U at the
top.) The spectra are dominated by the periods of the moon, T$= 13.944 months,
and of the sun, T⊙ = 12.368 months = 1 year, but a large number of smaller peaks
demonstrate the complexity of the system. Next from above we show the sum of
the two quantities observed on the western horizon, ˇS ´U+NA. This quantity – and
similarly the sum ME+GE6 observed on the eastern horizon – is a much smoother
and more regular function of L. As its Fourier spectrum reveals, it is mainly a
beat due to the two periods T⊙ and T$. The two small components with T
6
months are responsible for the ﬁne structure in (ˇS ´U+NA)(L) and do not aﬀect the
mean spacing of the “shells” nor the period of the beating amplitude. The func-
tion (ME+GE6)(L) has an almost identical Fourier spectrum, but its oscillations
as functions of L are phase shifted with respect to those in (ˇS ´U+NA)(L).

period T (months)

Fig. 8. Calculated lunar data (from top to bottom) SU, ˇS ´U+NA, Σ = (ˇS ´U+NA)+(ME+GE6)
and ∆ = (ˇS ´U+NA)−(ME+GE6). Left: values as functions of the lunation number L. Right: their
Fourier transforms (absolute values in arbitrary units) versus period T in months.

This behaviour is explained if one writes (ˇS ´U+NA)(L) and (ME+GE6)(L) as a

sum and a diﬀerence, respectively, of two periodic functions:

( ˘S ´U +NA)(L) = f$(L) + g⊙(L) ,

(ME + GE6)(L) = f$(L)

g⊙(L) ,

−

whereby f$(L) does not depend on T⊙ and g⊙(L) does not depend on T$ (see
Ref.11 for the astronomical justiﬁcation of this statement). Hence, by constructing
the sum Σ = (ˇS ´U+NA)+(ME+GE6) one can eliminate the component with the
period T⊙ of the sun and obtain a curve that is dominated by the lunar period T$.
Alternatively, the diﬀerence ∆ = (ˇS ´U+NA)
(ME+GE6) yields a curve dominated
by the solar period T⊙. (There is no evidence, however, that the Babylonians were
interested in ∆.) These facts are clearly revealed by the Fourier spectra of Σ(L)
and ∆(L) shown in the lower half of Fig. 8. Since for both sums ˇS ´U+NA and
ME+GE6 the Fourier peak corresponding to the solar period T⊙ is much stronger
than that belonging to the lunar period T$, both these functions oscillate mainly
with the period of the sun. It is only the function Σ(L) that can be ﬁtted by the
zig-zag function Φ(L) with the period of the moon, as demonstrated in Fig. 2.

5. Summary and conclusions

This paper has been stimulated by the close similarity between beating oscillations
appearing in the shell structure of nuclei and other many-fermion systems, and in
the computer-simulated lunar observables from Babylonian times. We have focused
on the method of Fourier analysis for extracting the dominating periods behind
beating oscillations. For the quantum oscillations in fermionic systems this method
is successfully employed in their semiclassical interpretation in terms of classical
closed or periodic orbits through trace formulae, for which we have presented some
examples.

We have given a short introduction into observation and theory of lunar phe-
nomena from ancient Mesopotamia. We have then shown how the use of modern
computer simulations of the lunar and solar ephemerides at ancient times allowed
for a partial reconstruction of the methods by which the Babylonians have arrived
at their nmerical lunar theory and their empirical schemes for prediciting lunar
phases. There is no evidence at all that they had any theoretical understanding of
the dynamics of the planetary system, nor any geometrical model for it. However,
they were excellent numerical calculators and based their schemes on the collection
and analysis of observational data over hundreds of years.

For a physicist it is a rather breath-taking experience to see old “experimen-
tal” data, recorded over 2500 years ago, reproduced by calculations requiring the
best present numerical knowledge of our planetary system. Of course, the computer
code of Moshier makes use of some old astronomical data, without which the ex-
trapolation of presently valid lunar ephemerides back to ancient times would not be
possible. E.g., there are long-term variations in the earth’s rotational velocity which
result in a clock error ∆T. For the time around 300 B.C., ∆T could be determined
from a solar eclipse recorded on the tablet LBAT 1285.22 However, the lunar data
reproduced in Fig. 3 and on many other tablets have not been used as an input.
Therefore the agreement seen in this ﬁgure, as well as in Fig. 2, gives us conﬁdence
into the accuracy of Moshier’s code. At the same time it conﬁrms the consistency of
our present understanding of the empirical origins of the Babylonian lunar theory.
With the help of Fourier analysis we have illustrated the way by which the
Babylonians could have determined the period PΦ of the lunar velocity, contained
in the column Φ of their lunar tables, from the sum Σ of all Lunar Four. If this
hypothesis is correct, then they have – without knowing it – performed a Fourier
decomposition of their observed data.

In any case – the mere fact that the Babylonians some 2400 years ago were able
to determine the length of the synodic month with an accuracy of six digits must
be considered as one of the greatest scientiﬁc achievements of history.

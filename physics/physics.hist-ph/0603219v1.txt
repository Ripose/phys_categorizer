Professor Richard H. Dalitz passed away on January 13, 2006. He was almost 81 years old and his

outstanding contributions are intimately connected to some of the major breakthroughs of the 20th

century in particle and nuclear physics. These outstanding contributions go beyond the Dalitz Plot,

Dalitz Pair and CDD poles that bear his name. He pioneered the theoretical study of strange baryon

resonances, of baryon spectroscopy in the quark model, and of hypernuclei, to all of which he made
lasting contributions. His formulation of the “θ − τ puzzle” led to the discovery that parity is not
a symmetry of the weak interactions. A brief scientiﬁc evaluation of Dalitz’s major contributions

to particle and nuclear physics is hereby presented, followed by the ﬁrst comprehensive list of his

scientiﬁc publications, as assembled from several sources. The list is divided into two categories: the

ﬁrst, main part comprises Dalitz’s research papers and reviews, including topics in the history of

particle physics, biographies and reminiscences; the second part lists book reviews, public lectures

and obituaries authored by Dalitz, and books edited by him. This provides the ﬁrst necessary step

towards a more systematic research of the Dalitz heritage in modern physics.

I. DALITZ’S IMPACT ON 20TH CENTURY PHYSICS

2

by Frank E. Close and Avraham Gal

Dick Dalitz was born in Dimboola, Victoria Australia, on February 28th 1925, and gained B.A. and B.Sc.

degrees in Mathematics and Physics in 1944 and 1945, respectively, from the University of Melbourne. He moved to

Britain in 1946 to do his Ph.D. at Cambridge, and then worked at the University of Bristol before joining in 1949

Rudolf Peierls in Birmingham where he subsequently became a Lecturer. He spent two years in the U.S. from 1953,

holding research positions at Cornell and Stanford, visiting also Princeton and Brookhaven National Laboratory, and

returned as a Reader in Mathematical Physics to the University of Birmingham for a year before becoming Professor

of Physics in the Enrico Fermi Institute for Nuclear Studies and the Department of Physics at the University of

Chicago. He moved to Oxford in 1963 as a Royal Society Research Fellow, the post he held until his retirement in

1990. Dick Dalitz made many outstanding contributions to particle physics, beyond the Dalitz Plot, Dalitz Pair and

CDD (Castillejo, Dalitz, Dyson) poles that bear his name. He pioneered the theoretical study of strange baryon

resonances, of baryon spectroscopy in the quark model, and of hypernuclei, to all of which he made lasting contribu-
tions. His formulation of the “θ −τ puzzle” led to the discovery that parity is not a symmetry of the weak interactions.

His Cambridge Ph.D. thesis, supervised by Nicholas Kemmer and completed in 1950, was on “Zero-zero tran-

sitions in nuclei”. It evolved from the theoretical advice that Sam Devons sought on his novel nuclear experiments

at Cambridge. Primarily it was a study of the well-known deexcitation by electron-positron pair emission of the
0+ ﬁrst excited level at 6.05 MeV to the 0+ ground state of 16O. Emission of a real photon is forbidden due to
angular momentum conservation, but it is allowed for a longitudinally polarised virtual photon that converts into an

electron-positron pair. His work on the higher order radiative corrections in such pair emission transitions in nuclei

rapidly bore fruit in particle physics in 1951 with his seminal contribution of “Dalitz pairs” [1]. This is a form of
internal conversion in π0 → 2γ decay where one of the photons converts into an e+e− pair, with a branching ratio
1.2 × 10−2, or for both photons to convert into Dalitz pairs with a branching ratio of 3.1 × 10−5. These Dalitz pairs
were observed in photographic emulsion experiments, as pairs coming from the origin of a π or K interaction or
decay and, to mention just two examples, were used to measure the parity of the π0 [2] and to establish, by the decay
of the Σ0, that the Σ0 and Λ have the same parity [3].

It was his work with the τ meson that revolutionised particle physics. During his Ph.D. thesis he had spent

a year working alongside Cecil Powell’s cosmic ray group at Bristol and it was during this period that he took

particular interest in the strange particles that were beginning to appear in cosmic rays and at particle accelerators.

These included the ﬁrst hyperfragment in 1953, which inspired a lifelong interest in hypernuclei, and the observation

of two kinds of mesons named θ and τ , with essentially the same masses and lifetimes. The positive-charge species,
both now understood to be the same K + meson, were clearly distinguished by their decays θ+ → π+π0 into two pions
and τ + → π+π+π− into three pions. Conservation of parity in θ → 2π would imply that it had J P = 0+, 1−, 2+...,
and the question was whether the τ which decays to three pions could have any of these quantum numbers. In 1953,

Dalitz looked at the decays of the τ into three pions and in doing so introduced what he would modestly call a

phase space plot, but which is known throughout physics as the Dalitz plot [4, 5]. The distribution of events in this
kinematical two-dimensional plot led to the conclusion that the τ had even spin and odd parity, such as 0−. Thus
was born the θ − τ puzzle: how could two mesons have the same masses and lifetimes and yet have diﬀerent quantum
numbers? The puzzle persisted for two years: Dalitz even musing to colleagues that perhaps the law of parity had

3

to be abandoned, although all the evidence at the time appeared to say otherwise. It was T.D. Lee and C.N. Yang,

who in 1956 realised that the assumption of conserved parity in weak interactions, such as β decay of nuclei, had not
been tested, and it was the weak force that was at work in the θ − τ decays. They were proved to be right, for which
they won in 1957 a well-deserved Nobel Prize. Thus, the θ and the τ were the same K meson.

In his 1957 review K Mesons and Hyperons [6], Dalitz showed that their parity could be neatly derived from a

strong-interaction production process; this established in due course that the K-meson parity is opposite to that of

the Λ, precisely the same relation as between the parities of the π meson and the nucleon.

Dalitz’s interests and contributions were not limited to electromagnetic and weak interactions. He made sig-

niﬁcant contributions to the strong interactions of the strange particles and their resonant states, soon reviewed

in Reviews of Modern Physics [7] and in Annual Review of Nuclear Science [8].
In fact, as early as 1959 Dalitz
and Tuan, by analysing the data on the strong interactions of K − mesons with protons, predicted the existence of
an I = 0, J P = (1/2)− ‘strange’ resonance about 20 MeV below the K −p threshold [9]. This Λ(1405) resonance
was discovered two years later, during Dalitz’s sabbatical year in Berkeley, by the Alvarez team in the Berkeley
hydrogen bubble chamber, studying the reaction K −p → Σ + 3π for several charge states [10]. The discovery of
Λ(1405) had been preceded by that of the I = 1, J P = (3/2)+ strange resonance Σ(1385) [11] in K −p → Λπ+π−
interactions, displaying the three ﬁnal state particles on a Dalitz plot. The p-wave πΛ resonance Σ(1385) provided a

straightforward generalisation of the non-strange p-wave πN ∆(1238) resonance discovered by Fermi and coworkers

in 1952 into the strange sector, and within a few years led to a complete SU(3) decuplet; by contrast, the Λ(1405)
required a diﬀerent dynamical origin. The proximity of this s-wave πΣ resonance to the ¯KN threshold suggested
that it can be generated by the ¯KN − πΣ inter-hadron forces, and this was shown in 1967 by Dalitz, Wong and
Rajasekaran to be possible within a dynamical model of SU(3)-octet vector-meson exchange [12]. The underlying
vector mesons ρ, ω, K ⋆, φ, which were discovered in the years 1960-61, relying heavily on Dalitz plots for some of these,
were unknown when Dalitz and Tuan predicted the Λ(1405). In the years to follow, Dalitz repeatedly considered

the completeness of this dynamical picture, whether or not the Λ(1405) S-matrix pole due to the inter-hadron

forces need not be augmented by a CDD pole arising from inter-quark forces upon allowing for an intermediate uds

conﬁguration. It is here that the earlier CDD discussion [13] found a fertile physical ground.

The discoveries of these, and other baryon and meson resonances as well, paved the way for Gell Mann and

Ne’eman in 1961 to introduce SU(3) (ﬂavour) symmetry into particle physics and the idea that a more fundamental

level of reality existed in what Gell Mann called quarks in 1964. It was initially unclear whether these fractionally-

charged quarks were just a mathematical convenience or were themselves real particles. It was around this time that

Dalitz returned to Britain in 1963 joining Rudolf Peierls at Oxford as Royal Society research professor.

Dalitz took the idea of physical quarks very seriously and proposed that they were the basic blocks of baryons and

mesons. In his remarkable Les Houches summer school notes (1965), Tokyo summer lectures (1966) and Berkeley

conference talk (1966), he showed how the idea explained properties of the proton and neutron, such as their response

to a magnetic ﬁeld and then took his more radical step of exciting the quarks into diﬀerent energy states for mesons

and baryons, following the established rules of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. To explain the pattern of the
baryon SU(3) octet and decuplet representations, embedded in the 56 dimensional SU(6) (spin-ﬂavour) symmetric
representation, required assuming what became known as a symmetric quark model, in deﬁance of the established

antisymmetry for fermions. While this was developed by several others, it was Dalitz who analysed the three body
state with internal orbital angular momentum excitations, using his earlier experience with the τ → 3π decay, leading
to a 70 dimensional SU(6) representation with negative parity as the ﬁrst excited states, as seen empirically, and with

4

higher excitations in 56, 70 and 20 dimensional representations of SU(6) with negative or positive parity. Over the
following decades many other resonances were discovered, for both baryons and mesons, in many cases by application

of Dalitz plots, such that the non-relativistic quark model, with QCD motivated SU(3) (colour) eﬀects incorporated

later, became established as a description of what had hitherto been a menagerie of particles.

While the quark model description of the low lying baryons has proved generally successful, its classiﬁcation

for the Λ(1405) as a uds SU(3)-singlet P 1

poses a serious problem. It was shown by Close and Dalitz [14] that a

2

consistent application of the Fermi-Breit interaction in QCD produces a spin-orbit splitting that places this P 1

state
, hence above the D-wave ¯KN resonance Λ(1520) which is ﬁtted well by this
assignment. Even if one accepts that the structure of Λ(1405) is dominated by inter-hadron forces, as in the original

higher than its LS doublet partner P 3

2

2

scenario put forward by Dalitz and Tuan, there remains a lingering doubt about a missing candidate for the quark

model assignment.

Dalitz pioneered the theoretical study of hypernuclei, atomic nuclei in which a Λ hyperon is bound and which are
as long lived as the Λ’s free-space lifetime of order 10−10 sec. Λ hypernuclei, produced by K − mesons stopping in
emulsion and identiﬁed by their decay products, were discovered by Danysz and Pniewski in 1953, and have been
produced systematically in accelerators for the last 30 years using K − and π+ beams to convert a bound neutron into
a bound Λ.
[Danysz and Pniewski also headed the discovery in 1963 of the ﬁrst of several known to date double-Λ
hypernuclei, from which Dalitz immediately provided the ﬁrst estimate on the Λ − Λ interaction; he would come back
in 1989 to this issue in connection with the then argued stability of a dihyperon H made out of uuddss quarks in a

diﬀerent conﬁguration than just two Λs (each one made out of uds)]. Hypernuclei provide unique information on the

strangeness degree of freedom for studies of dense hadronic or quark matter in stars.

Dalitz’s ﬁrst published work on hypernuclei dates back to 1955, dealing with charge independence in light hy-
pernuclei. In a series of works covering three decades, he used the main Λ → pπ− weak-decay mode of the light
species (A <∼ 13) studied in emulsion and bubble chambers to determine their ground-state spins and, thereby to gain
information on the spin dependence of the ΛN force. But his early outstanding contribution to weak interactions
in hypernuclei, together with Martin Block [15], was to formulate the phenomenology of non-mesonic ΛN → N N
weak-interaction decay modes that dominate the decays of heavier hypernuclei, a process that cannot be studied

on free baryons and which oﬀers new systems, Λ hypernuclei, for exploring the little understood ∆I = 1/2 rule in

non-leptonic weak interactions.

Another important contribution, in the 1970s, following the introduction of shell-model techniques by Gal, Soper and

Dalitz, was to chart together with Avraham Gal [16] the production and electromagnetic decay schemes anticipated

for excited states in light hypernuclei in order to derive the complete spin dependence of the ΛN interaction eﬀective

in these hypernuclei. This work, developed further together with John Millener and Carl Dover [17], served as a useful

guide to the hypernuclear γ-ray measurements completed in the last few years, at KEK and BNL [18], which yielded

full determination of the spin dependence in the low-lying spectrum.

Dalitz and Gal also studied the extension of Wigner’s spin-isospin SU(4) symmetry in light nuclei to SU(6) approx-

imate symmetry in light hypernuclei [19], following a suggestion by Kerman and Lipkin to generalise isospin SU(2)

into Sakata SU(3) symmetry for the p, n, Λ constituents of hypernuclei. This resulted in a unique feature named by

them ‘supersymmetry’ (before this attribute was taken up in particle physics), holding for particularly symmetric

Λ-hypernuclear excited states in which the Λ occupies a quantum state forbidden for nucleons owing to the Pauli
principle. Such states have been observed in 9
ΛBe at KEK [18] and bear important information on the eﬀective ΛN
interaction in the p shell.

In later years Dalitz, mostly with Don Davis and Toshio Motoba, focused attention to unbound Λ-hypernuclear

5

levels that had been precisely studied in nuclear emulsions by following their proton emission tracks. With Andrzej
Deloﬀ he collaborated on K − interactions in deuterium and helium. He was the recognised leader of this ﬁeld of
research for 50 years, and it is instructive to read through his own recollection of events in his last published paper

[20] which is based on a talk given in HYP2003 at Jlab.

He was also intimately involved with the identiﬁcation of the top quark where he thought about the prob-

lems of how one might identify it from the decay processes that seemed most natural for it. With Gary Goldstein he

worked out a geometrical method by which experimental data could be used to deduce the top mass. They applied

the method to an early possible event from Fermilab and concluded that if this event indeed signalled top production,

the top quark mass most probably exceeded 130 GeV [21]. This was regarded as an unexpectedly large value at the

time. This one event might not even have been due to a top quark and the conﬁrmation could only be decided on

the basis of a large number of observed events, all of them being consistent with a unique mass. This was the case

later when two experimental groups came to conclude that the top quark mass was about 180 GeV.

Dalitz worked close to data and was greatly admired by experimentalists. He brought scholars to Oxford,

which became a centre for the quark model, and trained generations of students, including Chris Llewellyn Smith a

future Director-General of CERN. Following retirement he remained an inspirational ﬁgure to students new and old,

continuing to work on theoretical physics with undiminished enthusiasm. With his death, international physics has

lost a major ﬁgure and Britain one of its greatest unsung scientists. As the next phase in the quest for the ultimate

nature of reality begins at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, it is likely that evidence for Higgs Bosons, supersymmetric

particles, or whatever other surprises may await, may be revealed by Dalitz plots.

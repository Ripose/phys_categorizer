Abstract

During the 80’s, some experiments and the repetitions of old ones,
lead to the hypothesis of a ﬁfth force. Nevertheless, a more accurate
research was not able to conﬁrm this hypothesis. This article wants
to go over again the most important steps of the event.

1 Introduction

In the study of dynamics, the concept of mass is introduced relatively to the
laws of motion; it is therefore called inertial mass (mi).
It is a universal
concept and it concerns with all kind of matter, whether it be a proton or
an apple.

Studying gravitation, another kind of mass is introduced instead, which
is called gravitational (mg), necessary to characterize the intensity of this
interaction. It is then posssible to divide the gravitational mass in active and
passive: this depends on whether it undergoes or generates the gravitational
ﬁeld.

If gravitation is a universal property too, just like the laws of dynamics,

then the ratio:

k =

mg
mi

(1)

does not depend on the type of matter and, choosing the units of measure
opportunely, one will obtain k = 1. This choice is implicitly made when the
universal gravitational constant G is deﬁned, therefore the constance of k is
equal to that of G.

This is the so called principle of weak equivalence, to be distinguished
from other forms of the principle of equivalence (medium and strong) which
regards other aspects of the gravitational theory, more linked with the theory
of general relativity (see [10]).

The most famous experiment to verify the principle of equivalence is,
without doubt, that made by Galileo Galilei at the beginning of XVII century.
Other experiments followed, by Newton, Huygens, Bessel just to quote some
of them. An important step was realized by von E¨otv¨os in 1889 and in 1922,
obtaining an accuracy of 5 · 10−8 [34]. Later on, in 1964 Roll, Krotov and
Dicke reached 10−11, using the gravitational ﬁeld of the Sun [23]. Again,
other experiments were made, especially on an interplanetary scale, which
conﬁrmed the validity of the principle of equivalence (see [10], [35]). On a
geophysical scale instead, one had stopped at von E¨otv¨os results of 1922.

2 The ﬁrst skirmishes

In 1981, an article by Stacey, Tuck, Holding, Maher and Morris was published
dealing with some anomalous measures of the universal gravitational constant

2

G, made in a mine site in Queensland, Australia [26]. In this article and in
others, Stacey’s group underlines a value of G, obtained through the measures
of the acceleration of gravity g in mines, also considering many corrective
factors [17], [26]. Therefore they think that the explanation of this anomaly
lies in the presence of a short-range potential, of the Yukawa type, that
overlaps the newtonian potential:

U = −G∞

(1 + αe− r
λ )

m
r

where α and λ are respectively the intensity and the action range of the
Yukawa type potential and G∞ is the value of G going to inﬁnite, where
Eq. (2) is to be reduced to the traditional Newton equation. The principle
of equivalence has as consequence the constance of G in time and space,
therefore a variation on geophysical scale would lead to the negation of the
very principle. As far as Eq. (2), for r << λ one would have:

(2)

(3)

G(r) ≈ G∞(1 + α −

αr2
2λ2 + . . .)

Therefore, a new type of interaction, which should be added to the other
four known, that is the gravitational, the electromagnetic and the strong
and weak nuclear interaction (actually they should be three, because the
electromagnetic and the weak nuclear were uniﬁed at the end of the 70’s by
A. Salam, S. Glashow, S. Weinberg and the experimental test was achieved
thanks to C. Rubbia at the beginning of the 80’s).

To these achievements, an article by Fischbach et al.

[13] was to be
added soon. After a reanalysis of the experiments lead by von E¨otv¨os on
the principle of equivalence between the inertial and gravitational mass [34],
Fischbach et al. ﬁnd out a similar course and attributes it to a short-range
interaction depending upon the material. From the authors’ viewpoint this
interaction had not been observed in the most precise experiment by Roll,
Krotov and Dicke [23], for these are referred to the Sun and to a wide distance
that makes the potential eﬀects of this new interaction negligible. As a matter
of facts, the two parameters α and λ which appear in Eq. (2) and which would
be respectively the intensity and action range of the ﬁfth interaction, have
these values: |α| ≈ 10−2 ÷ 10−3 and 1 ≤ λ ≤ 104 m.

3 A nest of hornets

At this point a nest of hornets was stirred up: a pair of comments, meant
to stress some thoughtlesses, were directed towards Fischbach’s group, in
particular to notify a wrong sign for α [19], [31]: Fischbach et al. [13] spoke
about a repulsive force though their analysis showed an attractive one. To
these objections the authors answered that the sign change did not invalidate
the global reasoning [14]. However, one has to mark that the sign α will
change several times, as well as the limits of λ, insomuch that the evolution
of these two parameters results more complicated than a hiccupping snake’s
route.

Stacey’s group shows up to help Fischbach’s group with a new analysis of
the anomalies took in the mines [17], [27], [28] and three other experiments.
The ﬁrst one was caried out by Thieberger [30], realizing an experiment based
upon a hollow copper sphere bathed into water and free to move about: this
should make it possible to measure the diﬀerences of acceleration between
liquid and solid. Thieberger put the instrument on an precipice on the Hud-
son River, New Jersey: this is already something that puzzles us because it
did not seem a good idea to place oneself near a river, therefore near to a ﬂux
of variable mass, to make an extremely accurate gravitational experiment.
Anyway, Thieberger himself, in a footnote at the end of the article [30], re-
ported that M. L. Good made him notice that the Coriolis’ acceleration was
not negligible in those circumstances and taking this under consideration re-
duces the deviation of the measured G. A similar experiment made in Italy
by Bizzeti et al. [7] did not point out notable variations.

The second one is a group leaded by Boynton, that repeats von E¨otv¨os
experiment though in two diﬀerent places; ﬁrst on a precipe on the North
Cascades, near to Index, Washington, then in a building of the department
in Seattle [9]. Some deviations from the value of G are noticed, though the
disturbancies may be held responsible again.

[11]:

A third experiment is made by Eckhardt et al.

it consists in the
measuring of the gravitational acceleration at ground level and at various
distances from the ground, by climbing up a telecasting tower of 600 m. The
experiment showed immediately its very limits:
in a commentary, Bartlett
and Tew proved that the eﬀect of the surrounding ground had been underes-
timated [4]. Eckhardt group’s questioned the feasibility of Bartlett and Tew’s
analitical method though not the possibility of a presence of ground eﬀects
[12] and, in a later and more accurate data analysis, the anomaly disappears

4

[18].

In that period, a number of experiments were made, but they all gave
negative results: on towers [25], [32]; the typical experiment of the free fall
from a tower [21]; on a wider scale with submarine measures [36] or also near
a channel’s lock [5].

4 Is the Earth a perfect sphere?

There are other very important experiments:
in 1990, Thomas and Vogel
[33] wrote a very witty and interesting article disheartening many ideas of
Stacey’s group. The ﬁrst, and perhaps the most important point, is that in
the newtonian gravitational law, Earth is considered to be a homogeneous
sphere, uniform and not–spinning. The famous formula:

is referrred to a perfect sphere. Nevertheless, reality is a little bit diﬀerent
and the Earth is lightly crushed at the poles, being therefore a spheroid.
What is more, it is not even stationary, homogeneous and uniform. One can
remeber that the Earth is spinning, introducing a centrifugal potential:

U(r) = −G

m
r

Uc(r, ϕ) =

ω2r2 cos2 ϕ

1
2

(4)

(5)

where ω represents the angular velocity and ϕ the latitude. The crushing of
the poles instead produces a deformation of the gravitational ﬁeld, expressible
with a series of spherical harmonics:

U(r, θ, φ) = G

(Am

n cos mφ + Bm

n sin mφ)P m

n (θ)

(6)

m
r

∞

2 n

a
r (cid:19)

Xn=0 (cid:18)

Xm=0

where a is the equatorial radius, φ is the longitude, θ is the colatitude
and P m
n (θ) are Legendre’s normalized functions in degree n and in order
m. Eq. (6) describes the gravitational potential of the Earth as the sum of
the potentials of endless ideal masses (monopoles, dipoles, . . . ), centred in
the origin and with a statistic weight, due to the coeﬃcients Am
n and Bm
n .
Eq. (6) can be considerably sempliﬁed taking under consideration various

5

(7)

(8)

(9)

symmetries and geometries (see [6], [8]); therefore at the end of the process
one can write:

Us(r, ϕ) = −G

[1 − J2

m
r

a
r (cid:19)

2 (3 sin2 ϕ − 1)
2

]

(cid:18)

where J2 = 1.082626 · 10−3 is the (dimensionless) coeﬃcient of ellipticity
of the Earth spheroid. Eq. (7) says that, in terms of spherical armonics,
the contribution of the quadrupoles is the most important one, after the
newtonian potential, which is the ﬁrst term of the series.

Then, the Earth gravitational potential can be expressed, with proper

approximation, as:

U = Us + Uc

Eq. (7)is very important, because it shows that the sole fact that the
Earth is a spheroid, and not a sphere, involves an additional term of about
10−3, very near to that of α, which shows the intensity of the Yukawa type
potential.

There are further factors of correction to be notiﬁed. For example the
correction for free air refers to anomalies introduced by observations above
sea level and it can be given with the formula (see [8]):

ga = −0.3086 · 10−5 · h

where h is the elevation above sea level. It is to be noticed that being g/h
expressed in s−2, Eq. (9) is valid both in SI (ga in m/s2; h in m), and CGS
(ga in cm/s2; h in cm).

Bouguer’s correction instead, takes under consideration the additional
masses above sea level, considering them as ﬂat, endless, homogenuous slabs,
equal in thickness to the altitude of the point of observation. Supposing
that the mean typical density of the Earth’s crust is equal to 2760 kg/m3,
Bouguer’s corrections turns out to be (see [8]):

gB = 0.1119 · 10−5 · h

(10)

What has just been said about unity of measure is valid here as well.
Using this anomaly, along with the study of seismic waves propagation, it
was possible to identify the Chicxulub crater, where the catastrophic impact,

6

leading to dinosaurs extinction 65 milions of years ago, probably took place
[16]. In this case, the comparison with seismic data allows to consider this
research as an indirect evidence for the classical theory validity.

Going back to Thomas and Vogel’s article, they report a series of measure
of gravity, taken near the sites for nuclear American tests in Nevada [33]. In
this case the G value has undergone deviations up to a 4% rate, against the
1% in Stacey’s measures. However, from the seismic analysis of the nuclear
explosion, it has been possible to discover a reﬂection barrier at 10 km of
depth that makes one suppose the existance of high density material, such to
generate anomalous potential gradients. If, at this point, one analyses Stacey
group’s data, it will grow extremely probable that the anomaly hypotesis is
due to the presence of some high density material, which is quite common
in a mine. Other experiments, made in Greenland gave similar results [3]:
the observed anomalies were due to intrusion in the ice of material at a high
density.

There is still a kind of experiment on this scale left, those made by using
the variation of the mass in pumped–storage reservoires for hydroelectric
power plants. In 1989, M¨uller et al. [20] traced no signiﬁcant anomaly, after
having taken some measure near Lake Hornberg in Germany. In 1997 instead,
Achilli et al. [1] obtained a positive result near Lake Brasimone. Making a
comparison of the two experiments, one notices some factors which may be
crucial: diﬀering from Lake Brasimone, Lake Hornberg has an asphalted
ground, therefore water inﬁltrations are extremely reduced. What is more
M¨uller’s group used two gravimeters above and under the lake, while Achilli’s
group used one only, under the lake. The experimental error in M¨uller et al.
is nearly totally due to the calibration of the two gravimeters (0.25 ± 0.4 %);
in the case of Achilli et al. instead, to obtain a very reduced error (0.1%) a
particular device was used, because with the usual method the error was to
high (1%).

5 How to get rid of local anomalies

Taken into consideration what we said, one may well see that experiments
on a geophysical scale are far too dependent on the anomalies of density
present in the Earth crust. The possible alternatives are two: the ﬁrst is
to reproduce on laboratory scale the Roll, Krotov, and Dicke’s experiment
[23]; the second is to make experiments in space, in situations where the

7

gravitational perturbations would be reduced as much as possible.

The ﬁrst was made in 1990 [2] and repeated, with some improvements in
1994 [29]: it was called the E¨otWash experiment. This is, perhaps, the most
precise experiment up to now realized on laboratory scale in the terrrestrial
ﬁeld. Various contrivances were used to compensate the possible anomalies
and, at the end of measurement, the comparison between the inertial and
the gravitational mass for two samples of copper and beryllium resulted as
[2]:

mi
mg

mi
mg

(Cu) −

(Be) = (0.2 ± 1.0) · 10−11

(11)

the same order of precision obtained by Roll, Krotov and Dicke [23]. More-
over, Su et al. [29] reached about 10−12 with several other samples. Therefore
they did not ﬁnd any ﬁfth force, forcing its possible intensity to values still
more negligible.

The second possibility, that of experiments in space has not been brought
about yet. Many proposals have been made and one counts much on the
future International Space Station, as research laboratory for experimental
physics on gravitational ﬁelds [24]. Another experiment called Galileo Galilei
was accuratedly elaborated: it is to be performed in space and it should reach
a precision of 10−17 [22].

6 Conclusions?

In March 1992, Fischbach and Talmadge wrote an article to see what the
situation was [15]. Their conclusion was that, even though there lacked
any evidence for the ﬁfth force, the anomalies found by Thieberger [30] and
the Boynton’s group [9] were to be explained still. These conclusions are
deﬁnitively diplomatic for they do not underline that it is possible to explain
those anomalies by a wrong evaluation of perturbations. As Adelberger et
al.
[2] stress, it was never possible to reproduce these anomalies, not even
by the researchers who showed them.

Nevertheless, one has to point out that this episode has spurred a quantity
of experiments, which allowed to improve our knowledge of the gravitational
ﬁeld on a small scale.

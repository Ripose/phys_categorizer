1 METHODOLOGY

This paper, which covers some aspects of the astronomical background of the
chronology proposed by Gasche et al. (1998), is oﬀered here for two reasons.
That brief volume was intended to present a new approach and was not re-
garded as a comprehensive treatment of chronological issues in the ancient
Near East, and certainly not as the ﬁnal word on the role astronomy can
play in solving chronological problems. It was to be hoped that polemical
debate could be avoided and the ensuing critical discussion would be based
on the data and methodology presented. The drawbacks of the approach are
now apparent, however. On the one hand, there appears to be a real need
(e.g., Huber 1999/2000b) for some additional general explanation of the as-
tronomical conclusions published in that volume. On the other hand, it is
increasingly evident that the work of colleagues (particularly Huber) who
have employed astronomical methods requires a more direct kind of atten-
tion. The little attention payed to Huber and the lack of astronomical detail
in Gasche et al. (1998) can be attributed to the fact that the book’s origins
lay in the study of the archaeological material and the Middle Chronology,
and thus neither astronomy nor the High Chronology were at the center of
the project. A discussion of the archaeology must be left to my colleagues,

but papers by Huber (1999/2000a, 1999/2000b, and Huber, this volume) -
and criticism because we did not discuss his work exhaustively - demand
that the astronomical issues be raised again.

The archaeological material was abundant, but could not provide precise
dates. Astronomical data are one of the few means of securing potentially
relevant and precise dates; astronomical sources are rare in the ancient Near
East. Huber (1999/2000a : 55) described the very Ur III omens we selected
as being ”so detailed and unsystematic that they appear to contain actual
records of observations.” This statement includes two separate judgments
about the material. One is that the data are detailed and the other that the
organization of the material implied that actual observations were recorded.
The primary evaluation of the information in the omens depends upon
their reliability. This means that the more reliable sources must be selected,
and that preference be given to the most important parameters. For me,
”reliable sources” include astronomical data that can be extracted and which
are unambiguous in character; it does not mean that the sources are ”reliable
informants.” An astronomer can recognize whether the data recorded reﬂect
unique phenomena which can be isolated. An astronomer cannot judge the
level of conﬁdence which can be assigned to any given text: only colleagues
from the relevant ﬁeld are qualiﬁed to translate the texts, thus allowing
others to make and debate judgments of this kind.

Some omens seem to meet these sets of standards. We exploited the
above-mentioned methodology for the analysis of the records with astro-
nomical content in the EAE series, essentially that discussed by Brinkman
(2000), with the goal of securing information which may be limited in quan-
tity, but of potentially high quality. Even if the conclusions are indecisive
from the standpoint of the questions originally posed, they may still allow
certain conclusions to be excluded by demonstrating discrepancies between
the alleged records and the actual events.

EAE 20 and 21 describe eclipses which have been linked to the Ur III pe-
riod. They have been regarded as being more reliable than the Venus Tablet.
By their very nature records of eclipses diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the records
of the visibility of the planet Venus. The omina that were interpreted as
recording an eclipse are regarded as reliable precisely because the descrip-
tion should allow he eclipses to be identiﬁed, if the description preserved is
correct. By contrast, it is a well-known fact that the Venus Tablet dataset
contains numerous errors. Separating the parameters from the background
noise must be accomplished by a statistical evaluation to secure the non-
corrupted information. The problem is not new, since statistical methods

inevitably face two fundamental obstacles:1

(a) the arbitrary character of the choice of the sample parameters to be

statistically weighed;

(b) the arbitrary character of the normalization of probabilities.
Each of these factors is crucial and a slight variation of the arbitrary pa-
rameters can suﬃce to distort the data to such an extent that the conclusions
are completely unreliable.

There are, however, also purely astronomical reasons which render the
alleged records of eclipses more valuable than the Venus Tablet. Doubt
can be cast upon the records of the Venus Tablet concerning issues ranging
from their apparent regularity to local conditions inﬂuencing visibility. This
means that even if the data preserved were completely uncorrupted, the
interpretation of the Venus Tablet would still be far from straightforward.

2 UR III ECLIPSES

The informative data recorded for the two lunar eclipses of EAE 20 and 21
can be reduced to 4 parameters :

(a) the entering and
(b) exit positions of the darkening of the lunar disk;
(c) the watch-times of the beginning and
(d) the end of the eclipse.
Some data recorded, namely the day of the eclipses (EAE 20 is dated to
14 Simanu and EAE 21 to 14 Addaru) and the direction of the wind are not
informative for our purpose.

In Gasche et al. (1998) we proposed the eclipse of 27 June 1954 BC
as a candidate for the EAE 20 description. In his critical analysis of our
conclusions, Koch (1998) concluded that ”the eclipse of June 27, 1954 BC
would appear to ﬁt the omen EAE 20 IIIB exactly.” He based this on the
fact that the correlation ﬁts the exit position (”lower west”). Since the
eclipse began below or close to the horizon in the twilight, ”the beginning
of the darkening was nothing more than the assumed position of the lunar
disk and therefore not binding for the examination of the Ur III Simanu
eclipse.” In contrast to the precise relationship between our candidate and
interpretation, Koch concluded that the eclipse proposed by Huber (1987a;
1For modern methods of the study of non-linear astrophysical problems, from planetary
dynamics to data analysis, see e.g. Gurzadyan and Kocharyan 1994, and Gurzadyan and
Ruﬃni 2000.

25 July 2095 BC) contradicted the textual evidence referring to the ”lower
west” although the exit of the actual eclipse must have been the ”upper
west.”

The crucial role of the end of the darkening results from the simple fact
that the end of a sequence is always more reliably recorded than its begin-
ning. The observer must adjust his position or instruments (in later periods)
and thus the description of the close of the sequence is always more accurate.
Regardless of all other errors - including scribal errors - the exit information
has to be considered more reliable for an eclipse identiﬁcation that the entry
information. Huber (1987a) overlooked this basic astronomical reality and
assumed the contrary, with the unfortunate result that his proposed eclipse
of 2095 BC fails to fulﬁl this signiﬁcant criterion. The record of the begin-
ning of the event will also be even more defective if the eclipse began below
the horizon, so that the beginning was in fact never observed, but merely
reconstructed.

In these cases, the duration and time may also be relevant. The crucial
criterion of EAE 20 IIIA that ”the evening watch passes and the middle
watch is touched” or of EAE 20 IIIB, that ”the evening watch is half over,”
is more suitable for the eclipse of 1954 BC than the eclipse of 2095 BC (Koch
1998).

The eclipse of EAE 20 IIIB also meets an additional condition, namely
that ”the lunar eclipse must end at the time when the weakly shining stars
become visible” (Donbaz and Koch 1995, 71; Koch 1998), which is again
suitable for the eclipse of 1954 BC, but not that of 2095 BC.

The situation with the EAE 21 XII eclipse is more or less identical,
but with one critical diﬀerence, the possible presence of a scribal error or
misinterpretation. The crucial parameter of the textual evidence concern-
ing the exit position of the darkening (”north”) matches the eclipse of 17
March 1912 BC precisely, but not that of 13 April 2053 BC (Huber 1987a)
(”west”). The only ambiguity in the eclipse of 1912 BC is the duration of
the watch-times. The omen records an impossibly long eclipse far exceeding
any possible eclipse, as Koch (1998) has pointed out.

In the ﬁnal analysis, however, the eclipses of 1954 BC and 1912 BC
(proposed in Gasche et al. 1998) ﬁt the most signiﬁcant information in EAE
20 and 21 while the eclipses of 2095 BC and 2053 BC (proposed by Huber
et al. 1982, Huber 1987a, 1987b, 1999/2000b, and Huber, this volume) fail
to meet the criteria, and actually contradict the conditions of the omina.
On this basis, at least, they should be excluded, regardless of any statistical
evaluations.

This illustrates one of the dangers of conclusions based on statistical
evaluations. Neglecting the basic astronomical information, Huber (1987b)
found that eclipses - which were ruled out for astronomical reasons - reﬂected
a state where ”the probability of error is below 1 per cent”. Statistics cannot
usefully be employed to determine the probability of something which is
excluded in advance. Similar diﬃculties lie behind other statements such :
”even if the chronology is wrong, we will ﬁnd a matching eclipse in a 20-year
window” (1999/2000a : 56), if the proper input information is wrong.

Huber (1999/2000a : 61) remarked that he had excluded the pair of
eclipses proposed by us because he assumed that one of them began ”too
early.” As we saw above, this is not the case : the eclipses correspond to the
crucial factor of the exit and are otherwise largely compatible with the givens
(Koch 1998), Huber had subjectively reduced the size of his sample before
commencing his statistical project, and thereby endangered any potential
reliability his methods and conclusions could have had.

3 THE VENUS TABLET

As mentioned by Huber and others, the data from the Venus Tablet has
been thrown into doubt due to the numerous errors which have corrupted
the text. It is therefore useful to examine the reliability of the presence of
the 56/64 year Venus cycle preserved in the text, and whether this can be
used.

The Old Babylonian calendar was not continually modiﬁed, but was al-
tered only when the discrepancy between the seasons and the calendar forced
the issue (Neugebauer 1975). One cannot expect that if certain Venus visi-
bility data ﬁt one given 8-year-period, that they would therefore necessarily
ﬁt the period of 56 or 64 years before/after with the same (a) probability
and (b) accuracy.

The probability implies that if a primary period is found to ﬁt the data
with a certain probability, then the 56/64 year earlier or later periods can-
not have the same probability. The accuracy of any given record indicates
the time separating the record from the last revision of the lunar calendar.
This means that, for example, 6 or 9 Venus cycles, i.e. 48 or 72 years re-
spectively, may happen to ﬁt the primary period that would be required by
the lunar calendar, since the scribe was obviously recording the oﬃcial date
recognized in the kingdom and not intent on making precise astronomical
measurements.

Changes in the calendar appear inexplicable without speciﬁc informa-
tion, and such changes are very remarkable when all other data appears to
be absolutely constant. For example, a historian studying modern records
based on a small data sample and only the knowledge of the Julian and Gre-
gorian calendars, would be perplexed by the apparent mismatch of events in
England in the 18th century or in Russia in the early 20th, unless a sudden
13-day shift might be recognized.

The meaning of such diﬃculties is overlapped with the intrinsic noise in
the Venus Tablet, compounded by visibility aspects, e.g. when the ﬁrst/last
visibility records might actually be made later/earlier than it is required
by the limiting stellar magnitude (Reiner and Pingree 1975), and potential
scribal errors, quite aside from unconscious restorations in antiquity. Al-
together, this means that the visibility records could actually be assigned
completely diﬀerent positions in the cycle. This demonstrates that the 20
chronologies proposed by Huber et al. (1982; Huber 1987a) cannot be used
in astronomical historical arguments.

The reliability of the lunar calendar in the Venus Tablet is further un-
dermined by the nature of certain errors. For example, the text of Omen 11
mentions the last visibility date III 11 and an interval of 9 months 4 days.
For the same period, Omens 21 and 59 record XII 11 an interval of 4 days
(Reiner and Pingree 1975), thus indicating the adjustment between the date
and the interval made by the copyist. This reﬂected the tradition of insert-
ing ”appropriate data” rather than actual data drawn from observations, in
order to secure regularity (Neugebauer 1983; see also Fatoohi et al. 1999,
51).

What can, therefore, be extracted from the Venus Tablet with a high
degree of conﬁdence ? In Gasche et al. (1998), we advocated the use of the
least noisy signature, namely, the use of the basic 8-year cycle to the exclu-
sion of all others, i.e., any trace of the 584 day Venus synodic period (roughly
5 synodic Venus periods = 8 sidereal years minus 4 days). Only the relative
sequence of the inferior and superior conjunctions is reﬂected in the tablet
and not the absolute lunar calendar. In stating that the recorded observa-
tions were not visible for the proposed inferior conjunctions compatible for
our proposed year for Ammisaduqa 1, Huber (1999/2000a : 53) shows that
he has failed to appreciate the signiﬁcance of our method. Since our system
does not recognize the validity of Huber’s calendar for 20 chronologies, our
8-year Venus cycles are not anchored as Huber’s are. The result is that the
8-year Venus cycle data are compatible with the data drawn from the lunar
eclipses, because they do not rely on Huber’s 20 chronologies, which are

based on the rejected 56/64 year cycles. The background noise in the Venus
Tablet makes this virtually the only logical approach : recognize the 8-year
cycles.

Later, I became aware that Hunger (2000) has also recognized only the

8-year cycle.

The relative sequence of the inferior and superior conjunctions and not
the lunar calendar lie at the base of our approach to the 8-year Venus cycles.
This sequence was unique and its signature would have been the last to
have been eﬀaced and lost as a result of careless copying and inattentive
observation. The date for Ammisaduqa 1 = 1550 BC is thus anchored by
the lunar eclipses but not by the lunar calendar.

To illustrate the signiﬁcance and value of the method, the Venus data
for Ammisaduqa 1 are calculated for 1702, 1646, 1582 and 1550 BC, corre-
sponding to the traditional High, Middle, Low Chronologies, and Ultra-Low

of local visibility conditions and other uncertainties, the elongation alone is
presented. The data thus relies on the angular separation of Venus from
the Sun, by means of which Venus becomes invisible from a speciﬁc critical
angle Θcr. The glare critical angle for average vision is given by the formula
(Schaefer 1991) :

log Θcr = 0.2(9.28 + mv),

where mv is the visual stellar magnitude. The Table 1 below includes the
dates of Venus’s passage according to the angle Θcr = 11◦.

The relative magnitudes for each chronology are calculated and Universal
Time is set at 00:41. The calculations were performed with the Ephemeris
- Tool 4.1 Version 4.1003, 2000 software, elaborated by M. Dings based on
Newcomb theories, which is quite suﬃcient for this purpose. The sequence
of the conjunctions can be clearly followed for each chronology. The data in
the Venus Tablet can only be linked to any given chronology if anchored by
an alternative link. Without any reliable data (such as the Ur III eclipses),
the signal cannot be anchored with conﬁdence.

4 MONTH LENGTHS

The principal of the method is to ﬁt the distribution of 29 and 30 day
months to any given chronology. With this goal, Huber (1987b) relied upon
assumptions which could possibly distort the conclusions, e.g.

(a) assuming that data from incompatible collections, e.g. Late and
Neo-Babylonian, share the same month-length distribution and data quality,
which is certainly not fulﬁlled;

(b) the distribution of month lengths for his datasets cannot be given
binomial or Poissonian distribution, due to potential inhomogeneities in the
frequencies;

(c) the use of sample-depended parameters.
Let us illustrate the situation with his analysis of Ur III month lengths
where an explicit plot is available (Huber 1987b; Exhibit 4). The data have
K0 = 83 discrepancies from N = 228 month lengths. He concludes that
the result favours the High Chronology while conceding ”that the statistical
signiﬁcance is not quite reached.” This does not quite compare with the
conﬁdence he has since expressed on the very same results in his later papers.
The situation is, however, more complicated, as it revolves around the issue
of the choice of the correctness of one of the two distributions. A proper
evaluation of A (correct chronology) and B (best of wrong chronologies) must
also include the null hypothesis. Then, at K > K0, the area between the
distribution curve of A and the abscissa (discrepancy) axis will correspond
to the signiﬁcance level of the hypothesis ”A is correct” but the criterion is
excluding it. A K < K0, the area below the distribution curve corresponding
to the hypothesis B indicates the probability of the error of the second
category, i.e., when hypothesis B is correct but the criterion accepts the
hypothesis A. Since K0 is sample dependent and non-homogeneous and is
hence unstable, no conclusion can be drawn on the correctness of either
of the hypotheses (e.g., Prokhorov and Statulevicuius 2000). As Schaefer
(1999) noted, ”without a disproof of the null hypothesis, Occam’s Razor
would imply that the claimed discovery is false.” The situation is similar or
even worse for his other samples : 6-13 discrepancies in 21 month lengths
(Ammisaduqa) and 20 discrepancies in 57 (Hammurabi-Samsuiluna) (Huber
1987b).

Besides this, there are also crucial astronomical-observational eﬀects
which were neglected by Huber. First, the lunar synodic period is not 29.53,
but can vary from 29.27 to 29.83 days (see Schaefer 1992). Second, as is
noted in Schaefer (1992), Huber had not taken into account the seasonal
variations of the extinction coeﬃcients, while there are numerous eﬀects to
be taken into account, i.e. the lunar albedo, the relative positions of the
moon with respect to the sun and the horizon, the dependence of the ex-
tinction coeﬃcient on the date, latitude, humidity, on the optical pathlength
in the atmosphere, the atmospheric refraction, the brightness of the twilight

sky, the detection probability of the human eye, etc.

Such statistical approaches cannot, therefore, be used for any far-reaching
conclusions concerning any chronologies. The month-lengths, however, may
serve as a useful complementary tool for more complete and reliable datasets.

5 CONCLUSION

We have, therefore, observed that Huber (1987a; 1987b) arrived at erroneous
eclipse identiﬁcations while failing to consider others which were potentially
valid. This was at least partially due to his neglect of important bits of
astronomical information recorded in the omens. The same neglect also
accounts for his claims for the potential eclipses proposed for the Akkadian
period (Huber 1999/2000a).2 Huber’s interpretation of the Venus Tablet
is at least partially illusory since (a) the estimations of conﬁdence levels
are biased, (b) the 56/64 year cycles cannot be traced through and linked
with a moving lunar calendar, and (c) his month-length assumptions are not
statistically signiﬁcant enough to match his chronological aims.

Without these supports, the High Chronology lacks any astronomical
basis. Nor does any actual alternative support exist for the High Chronol-
ogy (Hunger, personal communication). Huber (1999/2000b) himself con-
cedes that the High Chronology is not supported by other alternative data.
He nevertheless continues to claim that his astronomical arguments remain
valid, even though - as we saw above - there are reasonable grounds for
disputing them.

The analysis of astronomical records by distinguishing the reliability of
their information as well as their possible chronological signiﬁcance promises
to produce results. Isolating the eclipse parameters of EAE 20 and 21 and
extracting the limited data from the Venus Tablet allow a high degree of
conﬁdence in employing these as the astronomical anchor for the Ultra-Low
Chronology proposed in Gasche et al. (1998).3

As stated at the outset, the astronomical and historical sources were
2There are many cases which demonstrate that the purely statistical-probability ap-
proach is insuﬃcient and misleading. Nobel laureate Piotr Kapitza drew attention to the
fact that ”numerous mistakes and false discoveries [are] obtained via statistical analysis,
when the scientist aims to obtain the desirable result” (Kapitza 1981).

3Due to technical reasons I had no possibility to see the ﬁnal galley proofs of Gasche
et al. (1998), as well as the artwork in Gurzadyan (2000) prepared by the editors, and
therefore here I tried to maximally clarify the points which might be misinterpreted from
there.

sought to buttress an argument which was primarily based on archaeolog-
ical evidence. The typological and stratigraphical evidence originally pre-
sented has not been thrown into doubt. Scholars not associated with the
development of this hypothesis studying seals (e.g., Gualandi 1998), Egyp-
tian materials (Krauss 1998 and personal communication), and Anatolian
dendrochronological evidence (Kuniholm et al. 1996) have all provided ad-
ditional interpretations of evidence compatible with the Ultra-Low Chronol-
ogy. Other contributors present at the Ghent Colloquium (e.g. the contribu-
tions of Gates, van Soldt and Warburton in this volume) likewise presented
interpretations compatible with the Ultra-Low Chronology.

While no compelling arguments have been brought against any elements
of the astronomical or archaeological evidence, Hunger (2000) has likewise
come to share the opinion of the Venus data, suggesting that only the 8-year
cycles can be taken as reliable markers.

The recent conclusion drawn by Spence on the shortening of the Egyptian
chronology of the IIIrd millennium BC by means of her remarkable idea on
the alignment of the pyramids at Giza (Spence 2000, Gingerich 2000) is also
compatible (Warburton, in this volume) with the Ultra-Low Chronology.

Our work was built on that of previous generations of scholars and has
been achieved through intensive co-operation between the representatives
of each discipline. We believe that such collaboration can lead to a deeper
insight into analogous multi-scale problems, and believe that it will become
a common practice in the future.4

4The news that a record of another solar eclipse linked to the life of the Assyrian
King Samsi-Adad has been discovered suggests such further co-operation. Particularly,
the eclipses of 8 October -1763 and 28 July -1732 would have been visible at Mari, but
only with a co-operation that the potential chronological signiﬁcance of these and other
eclipses can be established.

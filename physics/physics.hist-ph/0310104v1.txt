DAVID HILBERT AND THE ORIGIN OF THE
“SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION”

SALVATORE ANTOCI

Abstract. The very early dismissal of Schwarzschild’s original solution
and manifold, and the rise, under Schwarzschild’s name, of the inequiva-
lent solution and manifold found instead by Hilbert, are scrutinised and
commented upon, in the light of the subsequent occurrences.

It is reminded that Hilbert’s manifold suﬀers from two defects, that
are absent in Schwarzschild’s manifold. It does not admit a consistent
drawing of the arrow of time, and it allows for an invariant, local, in-
trinsic singularity in its interior. The former defect is remedied by the
change of topology of the extensions proposed by Synge, Kruskal and
Szekeres. The latter persists unaﬀected in the extensions, since it is of
local character.

1. Introduction

There is, indisputably, no issue in Einstein’s theory of general relativ-
ity that has been so accurately scrutinized, and by so many relativists in
so many decades, like the “Schwarzschild solution”. Innumerable research
articles have been devoted to its study, and still are at the present day.
Any textbook of relativity, either introductory or advanced, cannot help
dedicating one chapter or more to the derivation of this paradigmatic solu-
tion of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations for the vacuum, followed by a discussion
of the obtained result and of the theoretical predictions stemming from it.
In the books published after 1970 (with some notable exceptions) one more
chapter is then devoted to the task of removing, through the Kruskal max-
imal extension, the singularity that the metric components in the famous
“Schwarzschild” expression for the interval

exhibit, in “Schwarzschild” coordinates, at r = 2m. The reader is always
ensured that this is a spurious singularity, devoid of local physical meaning,
due only to the bad choice of the coordinate system done by Schwarzschild.
It is therefore a bit surprising to learn, through the direct reading of the
original “Massenpunkt” paper [1], that Karl Schwarzschild never wrote a
solution given by equations (1) and (2), nor a solution whose manifold was
1

in one to one correspondence with the latter. Even worse: it turns out that,
due to his method of solution, he had the possibility to write a manifold in
one to one correspondence with the manifold described by (1) and (2), but
deliberately refused to do so.

In fact, after the Minkowskian boundary conditions at the spatial inﬁnity
have been satisﬁed, Schwarzschild’s original solution appears to contain still
two constants of integration, instead of the single one that appears in (1) and
(2). One of the constants has to do with the active gravitational mass, and
Schwarzschild chose it by appealing to Newton; the second one determines
the position of the inner border of the manifold. Schwarzschild therefore
needed an additional postulate in order to ﬁx this second constant. By
appealing to the requirement of continuity for the components of the metric
in the range between the inner border and the spatial inﬁnity, Schwarzschild
chose his second constant in such a way as to position the singularity that
brings his name just on the inner border of the manifold.

This singular outcome of the perusal of Schwarzschild’s original paper
[1] will not be expounded here any further, because it has already been
scrutinized in the Note [2] that accompanies a recent English translation [3]
of the “Massenpunkt” paper. One has rather answering here the ensuing
questions: how did it happen that the manifold described by (1) cum (2)
was called “Schwarzschild solution”, and why and when the original solution
with two constants of integration, hence with the need for an additional
postulate, was forgotten1?

2. Frank’s review of the “Massenpunkt” paper

It is remarkable that the substitution of the “Schwarzschild” solution (1,2)
for the original one [1] war a very early occurrence, certainly easied by the
premature death of Karl Schwarzschild. The seeds of oblivion were already
cast in the review with which Philipp Frank presented [7] Schwarzschild’s
“Massenpunkt” paper to the community of the mathematicians. An English
translation of the review is reported in Appendix A . The interested reader is
invited to compare that necessarily concise account with the original paper
[1]. In this way one can appreciate that Frank’s review faithfully extracts
several relevant points of Schwarzschild’s achievement by accurately follow-
ing the letter of the text. For the sake of conciseness, however, two facts
were completely left in the shadow. Their omission might have appeared
marginal to Frank at the time the review was written, but it became crucial
soon afterwards, when the rederivations of the Schwarzschild solution by
Droste, Hilbert and Weyl appeared [8, 9, 10] in print. And today, if one
reads Frank’s account without having previously perused Schwarzschild’s
paper [1], one by no means understands the rationale of Schwarzschild’s

1The memory of Schwarzschild’s original solution was rekindled at the end of the last

century by the works [4, 5, 6] of L. S. Abrams and C. L. Pekeris.

procedure, and why the manifold found by him happens to be inequivalent
to the one found in particular by David Hilbert.

By reading the review, one agrees of course with the initial choice of the
interval, depending on three functions F (r), G(r), H(r), but is soon led
to wonder why Schwarzschild did abandon the polar coordinates r, ϑ, ϕ,
that he had just introduced, and felt the need to go over to new spatial
coordinates x1, x2, x3, deﬁned by the transformation:

r3
3

,

x1 =

x2 =

cos ϑ,

x3 = ϕ.

−

One then wonders how Schwarzschild could determine his three new un-
known functions f1, f2 = f3, f4 from Einstein’s ﬁeld equations without im-
posing one coordinate condition, that is not mentioned in Frank’s account.
Only by looking at the reviewed paper does one gather why Schwarzschild
did work in that way. One discovers that he did not solve the ﬁeld equa-
tions of the ﬁnal version [11] of Einstein’s theory, but the equations of the
previous version, that Einstein had submitted [12] to the Prussian Acad-
emy of Sciences on November 11th, 1915. Those equations provided for the
vacuum the same solutions as the ﬁnal ones, but limited the covariance to
unimodular coordinate transformations. They read:

This very fact explains why Frank did not mention any coordinate condition
in his review: Schwarzschild did not need one, for equation (4), meant by
Einstein as a further ﬁeld equation, played that rˆole. This circumstance
explains too the otherwise mysterious adoption of the coordinates x1, x2,
x3, named by Schwarzschild [1] “polar coordinates with determinant 1”.

While the mentioned omission only hampers a proper understanding of
Schwarzschild’s procedure, the second omission had more far reaching conse-
quences. It concerns the number of nontrivial constants of integration that
occur in Schwarzschild’s integration of (3) and (4). They are three, and
were pointedly labeled as α, ρ and λ integration constants by the careful
Schwarzschild, but only α appears in the ﬁnal result reported by Frank. In
the review, no word is spent about the existence of two more constants of
integration, and about the way kept in ﬁxing them. The omission is nearly
irrelevant for λ, since Schwarzschild just set λ = 1 in order to fulﬁll both the
Minkowskian boundary condition at inﬁnity and the requirement that, for
vanishing mass, the Minkowski manifold be retrieved. It is however crucial
for ρ. The functions fi, as they read before ﬁxing ρ, are given in equations

(10)-(12) of the “Massenpunkt” paper [1]. They are:

Schwarzschild notes that (5) satisfy all the conditions previously postulated
for the solution, except for the condition of continuity, because f1 is discon-
tinuous when

1 = α(3x1 + ρ)−

i.e. 3x1 = α3

ρ.

−

In order that this discontinuity coincides with the origin of x1, namely, with
the inner border of the manifold considered by him, Schwarzschild chose
ρ = α3.

(7)

This is the reason why only the integration constant α survives in the ﬁ-
nal result reported by Frank. His review, however, by no means tells the
reader that a problem, which had to become of fundamental importance for
the future generations of relativists, had been seen by Schwarzschild, and
deliberately solved in a certain way.

3. Hilbert’s rederivation of the Schwarzschild solution

Frank’s review of 1916 by its omissions certainly did not help in providing
mathematicians and physicists alike with a clear idea both of the major
issue that Schwarzschild had confronted when ﬁrst solving Einstein’s vacuum
equations for the spherically symmetric, static case, and of the way out
chosen by him. It was however Hilbert, with his revisitation [9] of the static,
spherically symmetric problem, published in 1917, that deﬁnitely imposed
the ostracism on the original Schwarzschild solution. He did so by attaching
the name of Schwarzschild to the metric and the manifold deﬁned by (1) and
(2), that were instead the outcome of his own work, while dismissing in a
footnote as “not advisable” the inequivalent, pondered choice of the manifold
done by Schwarzschild. To document this occurrence, an English translation
of the excerpt from Hilbert’s paper [9] that deals with the rederivation of
the spherically symmetric, static solution is reported in Appendix B; the
above mentioned footnote is just at the end of the excerpt.

It must be aknowledged that, in this occasion, destiny exerted some of
the irony of which it is capable with the great David Hilbert. In fact, as
rightly noted [5] by Leonard Abrams, in the very paper by which he con-
demned Schwarzschild’s deliberately chosen manifold to undeserved obliv-
ion, Hilbert committed an error. A crucial constant of integration, that
played in Hilbert’s procedure just the rˆole kept by ρ in Schwarzschild’s
calculation, was unknowingly allotted by him an arbitrary value, thereby
ﬁxing by pure chance the manifold in the “Schwarzschild” form (1) plus (2).

DAVID HILBERT AND THE ORIGIN OF THE “SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION”

5

Hilbert’s error was no doubt inﬂuential in rooting in many a relativist the
wrong conviction that the manifold deﬁned by (1) and (2) is a necessary out-
come of the ﬁeld equations of general relativity. Indeed, it corresponds just
to one particular way of choosing the position of the inner border, that could
have been adopted by Schwarzschild too, had he renounced his injunction
of continuity for f1, and chosen ρ = 0 instead of ρ = α3.
Let us consider Hilbert’s derivation in some detail.

In the footsteps of
Einstein and Schwarzschild, he ﬁrst postulated the conditions that the line
element must obey, when written with respect to “Cartesian” coordinates,
in order to describe a spherically symmetric, static manifold. Then he went
over to polar coordinates and wrote the line element (42), where F (r), G(r)
and H(r) are three unknown functions. Due to the general covariance of the
ﬁnal ﬁeld equations [11, 13] of the theory, that he himself had contributed
to establish, in order to write a solution exempt from arbitrary functions,
one must impose on the line element (42) one coordinate condition, that
reduces the number of the unknown functions to two. Hilbert decided to ﬁx
G(r) by introducing a new radial coordinate r∗, such that

r∗ =

G(r).

He then dropped the asterisk, thereby writing the line element (43), that
p
contains only two unknown functions, M (r) and W (r), of the “new” r, and
constitutes the canonical starting point for all the textbook derivations of
the “Schwarzschild solution”. This is quite legitimate. What is not legiti-
mate, although ﬁrst done by Hilbert and subsequently handed down to the
posterity, is to assume without justiﬁcation that the range of the “new” r
is still 0 < r <
, as it was for the “old” r, because this is tantamount to
G(0) = 0, an arbitrary choice [5], equivalent to setting ρ = 0 in
setting
Schwarzschild’s result, reported in equation (5).

4. Forethoughts and afterthoughts

It might be asserted that Hilbert’s error, when compared to Schwarz-
schild’s meditated option for continuity, was a sort of felix culpa, because
it was, perhaps by prophetic inspiration, fully in line with the subsequent
understanding gained when the intrinsic viewpoint of diﬀerential geometry
was correctly applied to general relativity. Through this improved under-
standing the discontinuity of f1 occurring when 3x1 = α3
ρ, that so much
bothered Schwarzschild as to induce him to decide its relegation to the in-
ner border of the manifold by setting ρ = α3, revealed itself to be a mere
coordinate eﬀect. On the contrary, the singularity occurring at r = 0 in, one
should say, Hilbert’s coordinates, revealed itself to be a genuine singularity
of the manifold, deﬁned in an invariant, local and intrinsic way through
the pure knowledge of the metric. These facts are testiﬁed in any mod-
ern textbook by the exhibition of the polinomial invariants built with the
metric, with the Riemann tensor and its covariant derivatives. Therefore
one might think that while Hilbert, thanks to his error, stumbled over the

−

6

SALVATORE ANTOCI

right manifold, Schwarzschild’s conscious choice led him astray, due to the
rudimentary status in which the diﬀerential geometry of his times was still
lying. However, it will be noticed here that, despite the generally accepted
opinion reported above, Hilbert’s manifold appears to be aﬄicted with two
defects, that are absent in Schwarzschild’s manifold.

One of them was ﬁrst taken care of by Synge, when he built from Hilbert’s
manifold a clever geometric construction [14], later mimicked by Kruskal and
Szekeres in their maximal extensions [15, 16], in which the defect is no longer
apparent. The shortcoming was later explained by Rindler [17, 18] to be at
the origin of the strange duplication that the maximal extensions exhibit,
with their bifurcate horizon and the unphysical prediction of the necessary
coexistence of both a future and a past singularity.

The defect is simply told: Hilbert’s manifold intrinsically disallows a con-
sistent drawing of the time arrow; only the change of topology induced by
either the Synge or by the Kruskal-Szekeres transformation with the inher-
ent redoubling allows one to get a manifold where the arrow of time can be
drawn without contradiction, in keeping with Synge’s postulates [14].

A second defect of Hilbert’s manifold is revealed [19, 20] with the con-
tention that an invariant, local, intrinsic singularity is found at Schwarz-
schild’s two-surface, provided that one does not limit the search, in this
algebraically special manifold, to the singularities exhibited by the invari-
ants build with the metric and with the Riemann tensor. In Schwarzschild’s
manifold, and in the r > 2m part of Hilbert’s manifold as well, through any
event one can draw a unique path of absolute rest, because at each event
the Killing equations

and the condition of hypersurface orthogonality,

determine a unique timelike Killing vector ξi, that therefore uniquely iden-
tiﬁes the direction of time. From ξi one can deﬁne the four-velocity

the four-acceleration

For arbitrary gravitational ﬁelds, the Author deals with the problem
solved by Einstein for weak ﬁelds. He looks for a solution of the ﬁeld equa-
tion satisfying the conditions that all the gik be independent of x4, that
g14 = g24 = g34 = 0, that the solution be spherically symmetric, and that
the ﬁeld vanish at inﬁnity. Then, in polar coordinates, the line element must
have the form

The integration of the partial diﬀerential equations (36) is possible also in
another case, that for the ﬁrst time has been dealt with by Einstein2 and by
Schwarzschild3. In the following I provide for this case a way of solution that
does not make any hypothesis on the gravitational potentials gµν at inﬁnity,
and that moreover oﬀers advantages also for my further investigations. The
hypotheses on the gµν are the following:

(1) The interval is referred to a Gaussian coordinate system - however

g44 will still be left arbitrary; i.e. it is
g14 = 0,

g24 = 0,

g34 = 0.

(2) The gµν are independent of the time coordinate x4.
(3) The gravitation gµν has central symmetry with respect to the origin

of the coordinates.

According to Schwarzschild, if one poses

w1 = r cos ϑ
w2 = r sin ϑ cos ϕ
w3 = r sin ϑ sin ϕ
w4 = l

the most general interval corresponding to these hypotheses is represented
in spatial polar coordinates by the expression

(42)

F (r)dr2 + G(r)(dϑ2 + sin2 ϑdϕ2) + H(r)dl2,

where F (r), G(r), H(r) are still arbitrary functions of r. If we pose

r∗ =

G(r),

we are equally authorised to interpret r∗, ϑ, ϕ as spatial polar coordinates.

If we substitute in (42) r∗ for r and then drop the symbol
, it results the

expression

(43)

M (r)dr2 + r2dϑ2 + r2 sin2 ϑdϕ2 + W (r)dl2,

where M (r), W (r) mean the two essentially arbitrary functions of r. The
question is how the latter shall be determined in the most general way, so
that the diﬀerential equations (36) happen to be satisﬁed.

DAVID HILBERT AND THE ORIGIN OF THE “SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION”

One easily satisﬁes oneself that these equations eﬀectively entail the van-
ishing of all the Kµν; they represent therefore essentially the most general
solution of the equations (36) under the hypotheses (1), (2), (3) previously
made. If we take as integrals of (44) m = α, where α is a constant, and
w = 1 (a choice that evidently does not entail any essential restriction) from
(43) with l = it it results the looked for interval in the form ﬁrst found by
Schwarzschild

The singularity of this interval for r = 0 vanishes only when it is assumed
α = 0, i.e.: under the hypotheses (1), (2), (3) the interval of the pseudo-
Euclidean geometry is the only regular interval that corresponds to a world
without electricity.

For α

= 0, r = 0 and, with positive values of α, also r = α happen to be
such points that in them the interval is not regular. I call an interval or a
gravitational ﬁeld gµν regular in a point if, through an invertible one to one
transformation, it is possible to introduce a coordinate system such that for
it the corresponding functions g′µν are regular in that point, i.e. in it and in
its neighbourhood they are continuous and diﬀerentiable at will, and have
a determinant g′ diﬀerent from zero.

Although in my opinion only regular solutions of the fundamental equa-
tions of physics immediately represent the reality, nevertheless just the so-
lutions with non regular points are an important mathematical tool for ap-
proximating characteristic regular solutions - and in this sense, according to
the procedure of Einstein and Schwarzschild, the interval (45), not regular
for r = 0 and for r = α, must be considered as expression of the gravita-
tion of a mass distributed with central symmetry in the surroundings of the
origin4. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

4Transforming to the origin the position r = α, like Schwarzschild did, is in my opin-
ion not advisable; moreover Schwarzschild’s transformation is not the simplest one, that
reaches this scope.

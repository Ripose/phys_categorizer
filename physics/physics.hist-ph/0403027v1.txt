Dashen-Frautschi Fiasco and

Historical Roadmap for Strings

Abstract

In 1964, Dashen and Frautschi published two papers in the Phys-
ical Review claiming that they calculated the neutron-proton mass
diﬀerence. It was once regarded as a history-making calculation, in
view of the fact that the proton and neutron had been and still are re-
garded as the same particle with diﬀerent electromagnetic properties.
However, their calculation was shown to be based on a bound-state
wave function which violates the localization condition in quantum
mechanics.

There is one important lesson to be learned from the mistake made
by Dashen and Frautschi. They did not pay much attention to the
fact that there are running waves and standing waves in quantum
mechanics. The S-matrix formalism is based on running waves, while
bound-state problem are based on normalizable wave functions which
are standing waves. Wave functions contained in the S matrix are
analytic continuations of running waves, and they do not in general
satisfy the localization condition for bound states.

These days, there are very serious questions raised against string
theory. Is string theory a form of quantum ﬁeld theory? Is it a physical
theory or only a mathematical exercise. Is a new new Einstein going to
emerge from string theory? It is pointed out that, if the distinction is
recognized between running and standing waves, string theory has its
place in the historical roadmap land-marked by Einstein, Heisenberg,
Schr¨odinger, Dirac, Wigner, and Feynman.

1 Introduction

On April 29, at the 1965 spring meeting of the American Physical Society in
Washington, Freeman Dyson of the Institute of Advanced Study (Princeton)
presented an invited talk entitled “Old and New Fashions in Field Theory,”
and the content of his talk was published in the June issue of the Physic
Today [1]. This paper contains the following paragraph.

The ﬁrst of these two achievements is the explanation of the
mass diﬀerence between neutron and proton by Roger Dashen,
working at the time as a graduate student under the supervision
of Steve Frautschi. The neutron-proton mass diﬀerence has for
thirty years been believed to be electromagnetic in origin, and it
oﬀers a splendid experimental test of any theory which tries to
cover the borderline between electromagnetic and strong interac-
tions. However, no convincing theory of the mass-diﬀerence had
appeared before 1964. In this connection I exclude as unconvinc-
ing all theories, like the early theory of Feynman and Speisman,
which use one arbitrary cut-oﬀ parameter to ﬁt one experimen-
tal number. Dashen for the ﬁrst time made an honest calcula-
tion without arbitrary parameters and got the right answer. His
method is a beautiful marriage between old-fashioned electrody-
namics and modern bootstrap techniques. He writes down the
equations expressing the fact that the neutron can be considered
to be a bound state of a proton with a negative pi meson, and
the proton a bound state of a neutron with a positive pi meson,
according to the bootstrap method. Then into these equations
he puts electromagnetic perturbations, the interaction of a pho-
ton with both nucleon and pi meson, according to the Feynman
rules. The calculation of the resulting mass diﬀerence is neither
long nor hard to understand, and in my opinion, it will become
a classic in the history of physics.

Dyson was talking about the papers by R. F. Dashen and S. C. Frautschi
published in the Physical Review [2]. They use the S-matrix formalism for
bound states, and then derive a formula for a perturbed energy level using
the S-matrix quantities. Of course, they use approximations because they are
dealing with strong interactions. There are however “good” approximations
and “bad” approximations.

2

If we translate what they did into the language of the Schr¨odinger pic-
ture of quantum mechanics, Dashen and Frautschi were using the following
approximation for the bound-state energy shift [3]

where the good and bad bound-state wave functions are like

Figure 1: Good and bad wave functions contained in the S-matrix. Bound-
state wave functions satisfy the localization condition and are good wave
functions. Analytic continuations of plane waves do not satisfy the localiza-
tion boundary condition, and become bad wave functions at the bound-state
energy.

The Schr¨odinger equation is a second-order diﬀerential equation with two
solutions. If the energy positive, there are two running-wave solutions. For
negative energies, the two solutions take “good” and “bad” forms as indicated
in Eq.(2). The good wave function is normalizable and carries probability
interpretation. The bad wave function is not normalizable, and cannot be
given any physical interpretation. If we demand that this bad wave function
disappear, energy-levels become discrete. This is how the bound-state energy
levels are quantized.

3

In the S-matrix formalism, the bound-states appear as poles in the com-
plex energy plane. Those bound-state poles correspond to“good” localized
wave functions in the Schr¨odinger picture. At all other places, there are un-
localized “bad” wave functions. Dashen and Frautschi overlooked this point
when they used approximations in the S-matrix theory, and ended up with
the “bad” formula given in Eq.(1).

Yes! Dashen and Frautschi made a serious mistake in 1964, but why do
we have to raise this issue now? The answer is very simple. Since 1956, there
appeared many words in physics, including dispersion relations, Mandelstam
representation, Regge poles, S-matrix theory, N/D method, and bootstrap
dynamics. Each of these words dominated the physics during its own pe-
riod. However, they are now completely forgotten. The reason is that these
temporary topics failed to place themselves to the historical roadmap.

These days, there is one domineering word in physics, particularly in
particle theory. It is of course string theory. In view of the recent history,
the question arises whether this theory will also be lost in history or will
ﬁnd its proper place in the roadmap landmarked by Einstein, Heisenberg,
Schr¨odinger, Dirac, Wigner, and Feynman.

The purpose of string theory is to understand the physics inside rela-
tivistic particles. Since particles are localized entities in space-time, string
theory necessarily has to deal with standing waves. As in the case of of the
Dashen-Frautschi ﬁasco, it is diﬃcult to produce standing waves within the
S-matrix, or with Feynman diagrams. For standing wave problems, it would
be much easier to start with standing waves.

We avoid standing waves because it is diﬃcult to Lorentz-boost them,
while it is a trivial matter to write down plane waves in a Lorentz-covariant
manner. The expression for plane waves is Lorentz-invariant. Indeed, quan-
tum ﬁeld theory is possible because the plane waves are invariant. Plane
waves are running waves.

Standing waves are superposition of running waves in opposite directions.
Do those superpositions remain invariant under Lorentz boosts? No, but
they are still covariant. This is the question we wish to exploit from the 1971
paper of Feynman, Kislinger and Ravndal [4].

In discussing standing waves, it is common to start with a hard-wall po-
tential, but mathematically it is more comfortable to use harmonic oscillators.
Indeed, in their paper of 1971, Feynman et al. start with a Lorentz-invariant
harmonic oscillator equation [4]. This equation has many diﬀerent solu-
tions satisfying diﬀerent boundary conditions. The solution they use is not

4

normalizable in time-separation variable, and cannot be given any physical
interpretation.

On the other hand, it is possible to ﬁx up their mathematics. Their
Lorentz-invariant diﬀerential equation has normalizable solutions which can
form a representation space for Wigner’s little group for massive particles [5,
6], whose transformations leave the four-momentum of invariant. The little
group dictates the internal space-time symmetry.

The normalizable oscillator solutions can be Lorentz-boosted and can be
used to show that quarks and partons are two diﬀerent manifestations of
one covariant theory, as E = p2/2m and E = cp are two diﬀerent limits of
Einstein’s energy-momentum relation.

These ingredients obtained from Feynman and Wigner could serve as the
starting point for standing waves in the Lorentz-covariant world. If string
theory is going to survive in history, it should ﬁnd its own place in the
historical raodmap. If string theory is solve the problem within a particle, it
is necessarily a theory of standing waves. The issue is how to treat standing
waves in Einstein’s covariant world.

In Sec. 2, we point out what Dyson says is correct but he gives a wrong
example. Indeed, quantum ﬁeld theory can become eﬀective when combined
with diﬀerent branches of physics. We illustrate this point using the calcu-
lation of the Lamb shift.

In Sec 3, we note that there are running waves and standing waves in
quantum mechanics. While it is trivial to Lorentz-boost running waves,
it requires covariance of boundary conditions to understand fully standing
In Sec. 4, we study the S-matrix constructed from non-relativistic
waves.
scattering theory. The advantage of this approach is to trace the behavior
of wave functions in the S-matrix. While the bound-state in the S-matrix
theory corresponds to a pole in the complex energy plane, it comes from the
localization of the wave function in the Schr¨odinger picture. Approximations
in the S-matrix does not always guarantee the localization of the bound-state
wave function. This is the cause of the mistake Dashen and Frautschi made.
In Sec. 5, we review the history of bound and scattering states from comets
and planets. It was Newton who observed ﬁrst that the same physics is ap-
plicable to both comets and planets. Again, the same physics applies to scat-
tering and bound states in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. The question
is what happens in Einstein’s Lorentz-covariant world. Feynman diagrams
work for scattering states, but Feynman suggested the use of harmonic oscil-
lators to approach standing-wave problems in the Lorentz-covariant world.

5

In Sec 6, we discuss the space-time symmetry applicable to relativistic
extended particles. This symmetry is dictated by Wigner’s little group [5].
We review the progress made in this ﬁeld.
In Sec. 7, it is shown possible
to construct the covariant harmonic oscillator wave functions. These wave
functions can be Lorentz-boosted, but they depend on the time-separation
variable. As a physical application of this covariant harmonic oscillator for-
malism,

it is shown in Sec. 8 that the quark and parton models are two diﬀerent
manifestation of the same covariant entity. The most controversial aspect
of Feynman’s parton picture is that the partons interact incoherently with
external signals. This puzzle can be explained within the framework of this
oscillator formalism.

In Sec. 9, in view of Feynman’s eﬀorts, we point out that there is a
well-deﬁned place for string theory in the Einstein’s roadmap landmarked by
Heisenberg, Schr¨odinger, Wigner, Dirac and Feynman. String theory belongs
to bound states or standing waves in the Lorentz-covariant world.

2 Lamb Shift

It is a well-accepted view that Dyson gave a wrong example for the combi-
nation of ﬁeld theory and other branches of physics. Yet, Dyson was right
in indicating that old-fashioned ﬁeld theory could be more eﬀective when
combined with other branches of physics which produce physics which ﬁeld
theory cannot produce.

The Lamb-shift calculation is an excellent example. Quantum electrody-
namics leads to a delta-function-like perturbing potential for the hydrogen
atom. The s
state wave function does not vanish at the origin while the
state does. Thus the ﬁrst-order perturbation formula leads an energy
p
shift for the s

state while leaving the p

state unchanged.

−

−

Of course the delta-function perturbing potential is one of the triumphs
of quantum electrodynamics. On the other hand, QED cannot produce local-
ized wave functions for the hydrogen atom. We need the Schr¨odinger or Dirac
equation with the static coulomb potential to obtain those wave functions
needed for the Lamb-shift calculation.

In order to calculate those localized bound-state wave functions, we have
to impose boundary conditions at inﬁnity. This localization condition is not
properly addressed in QED or any other forms of quantum ﬁeld theory.

−

−

Indeed, the wave functions used in the Lamb-shift calculation do not come
from quantum ﬁeld theory. Dyson was right in saying that ﬁeld theory could
be more eﬀective if coupled with other branches of physics.

3 Running Waves and Standing Waves

The Dashen-Frautschi ﬁasco teaches us an important lesson. There are run-
ning waves and standing waves in quantum mechanics. Even though the
standing wave is a superposition of running waves, it requires an additional
care of boundary conditions. We do not know how to deal with this problem
in the S-matrix formalism.

If not impossible, it is very diﬃcult to formulate Lorentz boosts for rigid
bodies. On the other hand, it seems to be feasible to boost waves. Indeed,
quantum mechanics allows us to look at extended object as wave packets or
standing waves. Thus, we are interested in boosting waves. We should note
here also that there are standing and running waves.

Figure 2: Running waves and standing waves in quantum theory. It a particle
is allowed to travel from inﬁnity to inﬁnity, it corresponds to a running wave
according to the wave picture of quantum mechanics. If, on the other hand,
it is trapped in a localized region, we have to use standing waves to interpret
its location in terms of probability distribution.

Plane waves are running waves. It is trivial to Lorentz-boost the plane

because the exponent is invariant under Lorentz transformations. However,
what would happen when diﬀerent waves are superposed? Would the spectral
function be covariant or invariant? What would happen for standing waves
which consist of superposition of waves moving in opposite directions?

−

}

While quantum ﬁeld theory based on Feynman diagrams starts with run-
ning waves, quantum mechanics within a localized space-time region deals
with standing waves. If string theory is set to solve the problem inside par-
ticles, the physics of string theory is necessarily the quantum mechanics of
standing waves, as is indicated in Fig. 2.

In an attempt to obtain the answers to these questions, we can start
with some examples. As usual in quantum mechanics, the ﬁrst example for
standing waves should be a set of harmonic oscillator wave functions. With
this point in mind, let us see what Feynman did for harmonic oscillators in
the relativistic regime.

4 Wave Functions in S-matrix Theory

Because of the success of quantum ﬁeld theory which leads to the S-matrix
as the calculational tool, physicists were led to believe all the problems in
physics. If this was not the case, the S-matrix should be the source of infor-
mation for all physical processes.

On the other hand, the S-matrix is derivable from two fundamental the-
ories. One is of course quantum ﬁeld theory. The other is the quantum
mechanics of Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg, which leads to non-relativistic po-
tential scattering.

Indeed, much of the axioms or assumptions in the S-matrix theory is
based on analytic properties of the S matrix in the complex energy plane.
In particular, the bound state in potential scattering corresponds to a pole
on in the negative energy axis. Thus, a perturbed energy-level corresponds
to a displaced bound-state pole. Since the S-matrix can be formulated in a
Lorentz-covariant manner, we can study the covariant picture of bound-states
by studying the S-matrix poles.

On the other hand, the S-matrix in both ﬁeld theory and potential scat-
tering is basically a device to study scattering problems and is therefore
formulated in terms of running waves. It does not address the localization

8

problem of bound-state wave functions. In quantum ﬁeld theory, the S-matrix
cannot accommodate this localization problem because there are no localized
wave functions in ﬁeld theory. In potential scattering we are dealing with
solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation which can accommodate both running
and standing waves.

Let us see how we can derive the ﬁrst-order energy shift for perturbed
bound-state poles. We start with an attractive potential V r. For simplicity,
we assume that it is spherically symmetric. Then the radial Schr¨odinger
equation for the ℓth partial wave can be written as

φℓ(r) = jℓ(kr) +

[nℓ(kr)jℓ(kr′)

jℓj(kr)nℓ(kr′)] V0(r′)φℓ(r′)dr′,

gral equation:

ψℓ(r) = φℓ(kr) +

gℓ(r, r′)δV0(r′)ψℓ(r′)dr′,

which, to lowest order in δV (r), takes the form

ψℓ(r) = φℓ(kr) +

gℓ(r, r′)δV0(r′)φℓ(r′)dr′,

where gℓ(r′, r) is the “full Green’s function” constructed from the solutions
of Eq.(4).

For simplicity, we now restrict ourselves to the S wave and drop the
subscript ℓ. The generalization to higher partial waves seems to be trivial.

(23)

This is the ﬁrst-order correction to the binding energy. This formula is shown
to be the same as (φ, δV φ) for the square-well potential where exact solutions
are available for both scattering and bound states [3].

Dashen and Frautschi derived their bound-state formula from the N/D
method which corresponds to the above formula in non-relativistic potential
scattering. In so doing, they thought they could by-pass wave functions. Fur-
thermore, if we use the plane-wave approximation for the wave function φ(r),
δF (±) of Eq.(21) is reduced to the Born-approximation formula of Eq.(20). It
is thus tempting to use this approximation for the ﬁrst try. This is precisely
what Dashen and Frautschi did.

However, is the plane-wave approximation justiﬁed for bound-state prob-
lems? The plane-wave solution in this case is sin(kr) in Eq.(20). When the
energy becomes negative, the sine function becomes

sin(kr) =

(cid:17)

(24)

where b = √
s0 . For the bound state, S0 is negative. Thus, the above wave
function increases exponentially for large values of r, and is therefore a bad
wave function.

−

What happens when we use the exact formula of Eq.(21)? The wave
function φ(r) is expected to be properly localized at the energy s = s0, and
is drastically diﬀerent from the bad wave function of Eq.(24).

Dashen and Frautschi made this mistake because they did not realize
that there are standing waves and running waves in quantum mechanics.
For present-day physics, let us see what lessons we can learn the historical
mistake made by Dashen and Frautschi.

5 History of Scattering and Bound States

The issue of scattering versus bound states dates back to pre-Newton era. It
was not until Newton’s second law and his law gravity that a uniﬁed view of
comets and planets was established, as is illustrated in Table 1.

When Bohr established the law of orbit quantization of the hydrogen
atom, he was not able to explain scattering states. Then, the Schr¨odinger
equation was able to generate scattering and bound-state solutions. The
Schr¨odinger picture of quantum mechanics accommodates the wave nature
of matter. The Schr¨odinger equation is a second order diﬀerential equation
has two linearly independent solutions. For scattering states, it is capable
of two running waves in opposite directions. For bound states, one of the
solutions vanish asymptotically at inﬁnite distance, while the other increases
exponentially. We then demand that the wave function be normalizable. In
this way, we give a localized probability distribution to the wave function.
For scattering states, we give an interpretation of probability current.

The present form of quantum mechanics was developed for non-relativistic
world. Next step is to make it consistent with Einstein’s special relativity.
Since we are dealing with waves, we should learn how to Lorentz-transform
waves. The question is how waves in one Lorentz frame would look to ob-
servers in diﬀerent frames. The answer to this question is trivial for plane
waves of the form

exp (ip ˙x) = exp

i (~p

p0t)

.

(25)

This form is invariant under Lorentz transformation, is usable to observers
in all diﬀerent Lorentz frames.

It was possible before 1950 to develop quantum ﬁeld theory because ﬁeld
theory starts with plane waves of the form given in Eq.(25). For a superpo-
sition of plane waves:

ψ(x) =

a(~p)eip·xd3p,

Z

(26)

The spectral function a (~p) is deﬁned as a covariant quantity, but it has an
additional physical interpretation through second quantization or quantiza-
tion of ﬁelds. Yet, the ﬁeld theory starts with plane waves, and this is the
reason why it is possible to develop a covariant scattering matrix. It is also
possible calculate approximately the elements of this matrix using Feynman
propagators based on plane waves. Feynman invented graphical approach to
this procedure, and the word ”Feynman diagram” is very familiar to us.

The Feynman diagram is basically a physics of relativistic plane waves.
Plane waves are running waves. How about standing waves? Here we have
to take into account the fact that the standing wave consists of waves mov-
ing in two opposite directions satisfying boundary conditions. In quantum

14

mechanics, we need those waves which can tell us about localized probabil-
ity distribution in diﬀerent Lorentz frames. As in the case of the hydrogen
atom, the localization is deﬁned in the three space-like dimensions. When
the system is Lorentz-boosted those the longitudinal component gets mixed
with the time coordinate. We do not know how to deal with this problem.

It was clear that, from the talk Feynman gave in 1970 [7], that feynman
was aware of these problems. It is quite common in physics that physicists
test their new theories by using harmonic oscillator, as in the case of Einstein
for speciﬁc heat, Heisenberg for quantum mechanics, and Dirac for quantiza-
tion of ﬁelds. Feynman boldly suggested the use of harmonic oscillator wave
functions, instead of Feynman diagrams, to approach bound-state problems
in Einstein’s relativistic world, as is indicates in Fig 3. Feynman talked about
hadrons which are regarded as bound states of quarks. With two of his stu-
dents, Feynman published a paper in the Physical Review D [4] containing
the content of his paper presented at the Washington meeting. This paper
contains many mathematical inconsistencies, which can be ﬁxed up.

oscillators as the ﬁrst step.

the harmonic oscillator for the quarks bound together inside a hadron. For

where z and t are the longitudinal and time-like separations between the
quarks. This form is invariant under the boost, but is not normalizable in
the t variable.
Indeed, it is a “bad” wave function as in the case of the
Dashen-Frautschi ﬁasco.

On the other hand, the Gaussian form

also satisﬁes Feynman’s Lorentz-invariant diﬀerential equation. This Gaus-
sian function is normalizable, but is not invariant under the boost. However,
the word “invariant” is quite diﬀerent from the word “covariant.” The above
form can be covariant under Lorentz transformations. We will get back to
this problem in Sec. 7.

Feynman et al. studied in detail the degeneracy of the three-dimensional
harmonic oscillators, and compared with the observed experimental data.
Their work is complete and thorough. However, they overlooked whether
their oscillator states are consistent with Wigner’s little group which governs
the internal space-time symmetry of particles in Einstein’s covariant regime.
They have not reached this stage.

In Sec. 6, we shall discuss see bound states or standing waves are to
be constructed, and the role of Wigner’s little group for internal space-time
symmetries, before discussing the covariant harmonic oscillator formalism in
Sec. 7.

6 Space-time Symmetries

In solving the problems in physics, we should decide what coordinate to
use. For spherical problems which are spherically symmetric, we should use
spherical but not Cartesian coordinate system. For non-relativistic problems
we should use Galilean coordinate system. For covariant relativistic problem,
we should use Lorentz-covariant system. the problem.

Since Einstein introduced the Lorentz covariant space-time symmetry, his
energy momentum relation E = √p2 + m2 has been proven to be valid for

16

not only point particles, but also particles with internal space-time structure,
deﬁned by quantum mechanics. Particles can have quantized spins if they
are at rest of they are slowly moving. If, on the other hand, the particle is
massless and moves with speed of light, it has its helicity which is the spin
parallel to its momentum and gauge degree of freedom.

Table 2: Massive and massless particles in one package. Wigner’s little group
uniﬁes the internal space-time symmetries for massive and massless particles.
It is a great challenge for us to ﬁnd another uniﬁcation: the uniﬁcation of
the quark and parton pictures in high-energy physics.

Table 2 summarizes the covariant picture of the present particle world.
The second row of this table indicates that the spin symmetry of slow par-
ticles and the helicity-gauge symmetry of massless particles are two limiting
cases of one covariant entity called Wigner’s little group. This issue has been
extensively discussed in the literature [9].

Let us then concentrate on the third row of Table 2. After Einstein
formulated his special relativity, a pressing problem was to see whether his
relativistic dynamics can be extended to rigid bodies as in the case of New-
ton’s sun and earth and their rotations. As far as we know, there are no

Figure 4: Wigner in Einstein’s world. Einstein formulates special relativ-
ity whose energy-momentum relation is valid for point particles as well as
particles with internal space-time structure. It was Wigner who formulated
the framework for internal space-time symmetries by introducing his little
groups whose transformations leave the four-momentum of a given particle
invariant.

satisfactory solutions to this problem. However, according to quantum me-
chanics, these extended objects are wave packets or standing waves. It might
to easier to deal with waves in Einstein’s relativistic world.

Since Einstein worked with point particles when he was formulating his
special relativity and did not consider the physics inside the particles, Some
string theorists these days are calling for a new physics or a new Einstein
applicable to internal space-time symmetry and structure of particles.

However, there also have been many respectable physicists in the past to
see whether Einstein prevails inside the particles. As is illustrated in Fig. 4,
Wigner formulated the concept of his little groups to deal with the internal
space-time symmetry of relativistic particles.

The development of the quark model for hadrons was another important
step toward understanding Einstein’s covariance. The proton is a quantum
bound state of quarks. Since the proton these days can achieve a velocity
very close to that of light, and is a relativistic particle in the real world.

While the proton is like a bound state when it is at rest, it appears as a
collection of partons when it moves with velocity close to that of light. As

18

we shall discuss in Sec. 8, partons have properties which appear to be quite
diﬀerent from those of quarks. Can we produce a standing wave solution for
the proton which can explain both the quark model and the parton model?

7 Can harmonic oscillators be made covari-

ant?

Quantum ﬁeld theory has been quite successful in terms of perturbation tech-
niques in quantum electrodynamics. However, this formalism is based on the
S matrix for scattering problems and useful only for physical processes where
a set of free particles becomes another set of free particles after interaction.
Quantum ﬁeld theory does not address the question of localized probabil-
ity distributions and their covariance under Lorentz transformations. The
Schr¨odinger quantum mechanics of the hydrogen atom deals with localized
probability distribution. Indeed, the localization condition leads to the dis-
crete energy spectrum. Here, the uncertainty relation is stated in terms of
the spatial separation between the proton and the electron. If we believe in
Lorentz covariance, there must also be a time-separation between the two
constituent particles.

Before 1964 [8], the hydrogen atom was used for illustrating bound states.
These days, we use hadrons which are bound states of quarks. Let us use the
simplest hadron consisting of two quarks bound together with an attractive
force, and consider their space-time positions xa and xb, and use the variables

X = (xa + xb)/2,

x = (xa −

xb)/2√2.

(29)

The four-vector X speciﬁes where the hadron is located in space and time,
while the variable x measures the space-time separation between the quarks.
According to Einstein, this space-time separation contains a time-like com-
ponent which actively participates as can be seen from

Does this time-separation variable exist when the hadron is at rest? Yes,
according to Einstein. In the present form of quantum mechanics, we pretend
not to know anything about this variable. Indeed, this variable belongs to
Feynman’s rest of the universe. In this report, we shall see the role of this
time-separation variable in the decoherence mechanism.

Also in the present form of quantum mechanics, there is an uncertainty
relation between the time and energy variables. However, there are no known
time-like excitations. Unlike Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation applicable to
position and momentum, the time and energy separation variables are c-
numbers, and we are not allowed to write down the commutation relation

20

between them. Indeed, the time-energy uncertainty relation is a c-number
uncertainty relation [11], as is illustrated in Fig. 6

Figure 6: Space-time picture of quantum mechanics. There are quantum
excitations along the space-like longitudinal direction, but there are no exci-
tations along the time-like direction. The time-energy relation is a c-number
uncertainty relation.

How does this space-time asymmetry ﬁt into the world of covariance [12].
This question was studied in depth by the present authors in the past. The
answer is that Wigner’s O(3)-like little group is not a Lorentz-invariant sym-
metry, but is a covariant symmetry [5]. It has been shown that the time-
energy uncertainty applicable to the time-separation variable ﬁts perfectly
into the O(3)-like symmetry of massive relativistic particles [6].

The c-number time-energy uncertainty relation allows us to write down a
time distribution function without excitations [6]. If we use Gaussian forms
for both space and time distributions, we can start with the expression

for the ground-state wave function. What do Feynman et al. say about this
oscillator wave function?

In their classic 1971 paper [4], Feynman et al. start with the following

Lorentz-invariant diﬀerential equation.

ψ(x) = λψ(x).

(34)

This partial diﬀerential equation has many diﬀerent solutions depending on
the choice of separable variables and boundary conditions. Feynman et al.
insist on Lorentz-invariant solutions which are not normalizable. On the
other hand, if we insist on normalization, the ground-state wave function
takes the form of Eq.(33). It is then possible to construct a representation of
the Poincar´e group from the solutions of the above diﬀerential equation [6].
If the system is boosted, the wave function becomes

(cid:26)−
This wave function becomes Eq.(33) if η becomes zero. The transition from
Eq.(33) to Eq.(35) is a squeeze transformation. The wave function of Eq.(33)
is distributed within a circular region in the uv plane, and thus in the zt plane.
On the other hand, the wave function of Eq.(35) is distributed in an elliptic
region with the light-cone axes as the major and minor axes respectively. If
η becomes very large, the wave function becomes concentrated along one of
the light-cone axes. Indeed, the form given in Eq.(35) is a Lorentz-squeezed
wave function. This squeeze mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 7.

There are many diﬀerent solutions of the Lorentz invariant diﬀerential
equation of Eq.(34). The solution given in Eq.(35) is not Lorentz invariant
but is covariant. It is normalizable in the t variable, as well as in the space-
separation variable z. How can we extract probability interpretation from
this covariant wave function?

8 Feynman’s Parton Picture

It is a widely accepted view that hadrons are quantum bound states of quarks
having localized probability distribution. As in all bound-state cases, this
localization condition is responsible for the existence of discrete mass spectra.

Figure 7: Eﬀect of the Lorentz boost on the space-time wave function. The
circular space-time distribution at the rest frame becomes Lorentz-squeezed
to become an elliptic distribution.

The most convincing evidence for this bound-state picture is the hadronic
mass spectra which are observed in high-energy laboratories [4, 6].

In 1969, Feynman observed that a fast-moving hadron can be regarded as
a collection of many “partons” whose properties appear to be quite diﬀerent
from those of the quarks [13]. For example, the number of quarks inside
a static proton is three, while the number of partons in a rapidly moving
proton appears to be inﬁnite. The question then is how the proton looking
like a bound state of quarks to one observer can appear diﬀerent to an ob-
server in a diﬀerent Lorentz frame? Feynman made the following systematic
observations.

23

a. The picture is valid only for hadrons moving with velocity close to that

of light.

b. The interaction time between the quarks becomes dilated, and partons

behave as free independent particles.

c. The momentum distribution of partons becomes widespread as the

hadron moves fast.

of quarks.

d. The number of partons seems to be inﬁnite or much larger than that

Because the hadron is believed to be a bound state of two or three quarks,
each of the above phenomena appears as a paradox, particularly b) and c)
together.

In order to resolve this paradox, let us write down the momentum-energy
wave function corresponding to Eq.(35).
If we let the quarks have the
four-momenta pa and pb, it is possible to construct two independent four-
momentum variables [4]

P = pa + pb,

q = √2(pa −

pb),

(36)

where P is the total four-momentum. It is thus the hadronic four-momentum.
The variable q measures the four-momentum separation between the

quarks. Their light-cone variables are

qu = (q0 −

qz)/√2,

qv = (q0 + qz)/√2.

(37)

The resulting momentum-energy wave function is

φη(qz, q0) =

(38)

(cid:18)

(cid:26)−
Because we are using here the harmonic oscillator, the mathematical form of
the above momentum-energy wave function is identical to that of the space-
time wave function. The Lorentz squeeze properties of these wave functions
are also the same. This aspect of the squeeze has been exhaustively discussed
in the literature [6, 14, 15].

(cid:17)(cid:27)

(cid:16)

When the hadron is at rest with η = 0, both wave functions behave like
those for the static bound state of quarks. As η increases, the wave functions

24

become continuously squeezed until they become concentrated along their
respective positive light-cone axes. Let us look at the z-axis projection of
the space-time wave function. Indeed, the width of the quark distribution
increases as the hadronic speed approaches that of the speed of light. The
position of each quark appears widespread to the observer in the laboratory
frame, and the quarks appear like free particles.

The momentum-energy wave function is just like the space-time wave
function, as is shown in Fig. 8. The longitudinal momentum distribution
becomes wide-spread as the hadronic speed approaches the velocity of light.
This is in contradiction with our expectation from non-relativistic quantum
mechanics that the width of the momentum distribution is inversely pro-
portional to that of the position wave function. Our expectation is that if
the quarks are free, they must have their sharply deﬁned momenta, not a
wide-spread distribution.

However, according to our Lorentz-squeezed space-time and momentum-
energy wave functions, the space-time width and the momentum-energy
width increase in the same direction as the hadron is boosted. This is of
course an eﬀect of Lorentz covariance. This indeed is the key to the resolu-
tion of the quark-parton paradox [6, 14].

After these qualitative arguments, we are interested in whether Lorentz-
boosted bound-state wave functions in the hadronic rest frame could lead
to parton distribution functions. If we start with the ground-state Gaussian
wave function for the three-quark wave function for the proton, the parton
distribution function appears as Gaussian as is indicated in Fig. 9. This
Gaussian form is compared with experimental distribution also in Fig. 9.

For large x region, the agreement is excellent, but the agreement is not
satisfactory for small values of x.
In this region, there is a complication
called the “sea quarks.” However, good sea-quark physics starts from good
valence-quark physics. Figure 9 indicates that the boosted ground-state wave
function provides a good valence-quark physics.

9 Historical Destiny for Strings

Together with Marilyn Noz, the present author has been interested in ques-
tion of covariant harmonic oscillators since 1973 [12]. We started with the
covariant oscillator wave function as a purely phenomenological mathemat-
ical instrument. We then noticed that the covariant oscillator formalism

can serve as a representation of the Wigner’s little group for massive par-
ticles, capable of the fundamental symmetry representation for relativistic
particles. This allows us to deal with the c-number time-energy uncertainty
relation without excitations. Furthermore, the Lorentz-boosted Gaussian
wave function produces a parton distribution in satisfactory agreement with
experimental data.

What are then Feynman’s contributions to this subject? In addition to
the formulation of the parton picture, he suggested the use of harmonic os-
cillator wave functions to understand bound-state problems in the covariant
regime. Then where does the Feynman diagram stand in his scheme? Feyn-
man diagrams start with plane waves which are running waves. Harmonic-
oscillator wave functions are standing waves. For standing waves, we have
to take care of the covariance of boundary conditions or spectral functions.
This is precisely what we are reporting in this report.

It is gratifying to note that there is only one covariant quantum mechan-
ics for both scattering and bound states. In both cases, we deal with waves
in the covariant world. For scattering states, we are dealing with asymptot-
ically free waves and Feynman diagrams. For bound states, we should start
with standing waves. The covariant harmonic oscillator wave functions could

constitute a complete set of wave functions we can start with.

It is our understanding that the purpose of string theory is to understand
the physics inside particles, as is indicated in Fig. 10. Since particles are lo-
calized entities in the space-time region, string theory is necessarily a physics
of standing waves if we are to preserve the present form of quantum mechan-
ics. The Lorentz covariance of the standing waves should be the major issue
in string theory.

Abstract

We illustrate a simple derivation of the Schr¨odinger equation, which requires only knowledge of

the electromagnetic wave equation and the basics of Einstein’s special theory of relativity. We do

this by extending the wave equation for classical ﬁelds to photons, generalize to non-zero rest mass

particles, and simplify using approximations consistent with non-relativistic particles.

INTRODUCTION

One of the most unsatisfying aspects of any undergraduate quantum mechanics course is

perhaps the introduction of the Schr¨odinger equation. After several lectures motivating the

need for quantum mechanics by illustrating the new observations at the turn of the twentieth

century, usually the lecture begins with: “Here is the Schr¨odinger equation.” Sometimes,

similarities to the classical Hamiltonian are pointed out, but no eﬀort is made to derive the

Schr¨odinger equation in a physically meaningful way. This shortcoming is not remedied in

the standard quantum mechanics textbooks either1,2,3. Most students and professors will

tell you that the Schr¨odinger equation cannot be derived. Beyond the standard approaches

in modern textbooks there have been several noteworthy attempts to derive the Schr¨odinger

equation from diﬀerent principles4,5,6,7, including a very compelling stochastic method8, as

well as useful historical expositions9.

In this paper, we illustrate a simple derivation of the Schr¨odinger equation, which requires

only knowledge of the electromagnetic wave equation and the basics of Einstein’s special

theory of relativity. These prerequisites are usually covered in courses taken prior to an

undergraduate’s ﬁrst course in quantum mechanics.

II. A BRIEF HISTORY OF QUANTUM AND WAVE MECHANICS

Before we begin to derive the Schr¨odinger equation, we review the physical origins of it

by putting it in its historical context.

The new paradigm in physics which emerged at the beginning of the last century and

is now commonly referred to as quantum mechanics was motivated by two kinds of exper-

imental observations: the “lumpiness”, or quantization, of energy transfer in light-matter

interactions, and the dual wave-particle nature of both light and matter. Max Planck could

correctly calculate the spectrum of black-body radiation in 1900 by postulating that an

electromagnetic ﬁeld can exchange energy with atoms only in quanta which are the product

of the radiation frequency and the famous constant h, which was later named after him10.

Whereas for Planck himself, the introduction of his constant was an act of desperation, solely

justiﬁed by the agreement of the calculated with the measured spectrum, Albert Einstein

took the idea serious. In his explanation of the photoelectric eﬀect in 1905, he considered

2

light itself as being composed of particles carrying a discrete energy11. This bold view was

in blatant contradiction with the by then established notion of light as an electromagnetic

wave. The latter belief was supported, for instance, by the observation of interference: If

we shine light on a single slit placed in front of a scintillating screen, we observe a pattern

of darker and brighter fringes or rings. But what happens if Einstein’s light particles, let us

call them photons, exist and we zing them one-by-one at the same slit? Then, each photon

causes the screen to scintillate only at a single point. However, after a large number of

photons pass through the slit one at a time, we once again obtain an interference pattern.

This build-up of interference one photon at a time is illustrated in Fig. 1.

In 1913, Niels Bohr succeeded in deriving the discrete lines of the hydrogen spectrum

with a simple atomic model in which the electron circles the proton just as a planet orbits

the sun, supplemented by the ad-hoc assumption that the orbital angular momentum must
be an integer multiple of ~ = h/2π, which leads to discrete energies of the corresponding

orbitals12. Further, transitions between these energy levels are accompanied by the absorp-

tion or emission of a photon whose frequency is E/h, where E is the energy diﬀerence of the

two levels. Apparently, the quantization of light is strongly tied to the quantization within

matter. Inspired by his predecessors, Louis de Broglie suggested that not only light has parti-

cle characteristics, but that classical particles, such as electrons, have wave characteristics13.

He associated the wavelength λ of these waves with the particle momentum p through the

relation p = h/λ. Interestingly, Bohr’s condition for the orbital momentum of the electron

is equivalent with the demand that the length of an orbital path of the electron has to be

an integer multiple of its de Broglie wavelength.

Erwin Schr¨odinger was very intrigued by de Broglie’s ideas and set his mind on ﬁnding

a wave equation for the electron. Closely following the electromagnetic prototype of a wave

equation, and attempting to describe the electron relativistically, he ﬁrst arrived at what we

today know as the Klein-Gordon-equation. To his annoyance, however, this equation, when

applied to the hydrogen atom, did not result in energy levels consistent with Arnold Sommer-

feld’s ﬁne structure formula, a reﬁnement of the energy levels according to Bohr. Schr¨odinger

therefore retreated to the non-relativistic case, and obtained as the non-relativistic limit to

his original equation the famous equation that now bears his name. He published his results

in a series of four papers in 192614,15,16,17. Therein, he emphasizes the analogy between elec-

trodynamics as a wave theory of light, which in the limit of small electromagnetic wavelength

3

approaches ray optics, and his wave theory of matter, which approaches classical mechan-

ics in the limit of small de Broglie wavelengths. His theory was consequently called wave

mechanics. In a wave mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom and other bound particle

systems, the quantization of energy levels followed naturally from the boundary conditions.

A year earlier, Werner Heisenberg had developed his matrix mechanics18, which yielded the

values of all measurable physical quantities as eigenvalues of a matrix. Schr¨odinger suc-

ceeded in showing the mathematical equivalence of matrix and wave mechanics19; they are

just two diﬀerent descriptions of quantum mechanics. A relativistic equation for the electron

was found by Paul Dirac in 192720. It included the electron spin of 1/2, a purely quantum

mechanical feature without classical analog. Schr¨odinger’s original equation was taken up

by Klein and Gordon, and eventually turned out to be a relativistic equation for bosons, i.e.

particles with integer spin. In spite of its limitation to non-relativistic particles, and initial

rejection from Heisenberg and colleagues, the Schr¨odinger equation became eventually very

popular. Today, it provides the material for a large fraction of most introductory quantum

mechanics courses.

III. THE SCHR ¨ODINGER EQUATION DERIVED

Our approach to the Schr¨odinger equation will be similar to that taken by Schr¨odinger

himself. We start with the classical wave equation, as derived from Maxwell’s equations

governing classical electrodynamics (see the appendix). For simplicity, we consider only one

dimension,

This equation is satisﬁed by plane wave solutions,

= 0.

E(x, t) = E0ei(kx−ωt),

where k = 2π/λ and ω = 2πν are the spatial and temporal frequencies, respectively, which

must satisfy the dispersion relation obtained upon substitution of Eq. (2) into Eq. (1):

Solving for the wave vector, we arrive at the dispersion relation for light in free space:

or more familiarly

k =

c

,

νλ = c,

where c is the wave propagation speed, in this case the speed of light in vacuum. These

solutions represent classical electromagnetic waves, which we know are somehow related to

the quantum theory’s photons.

Recall from Einstein and Compton that the energy of a photon is E = hν = ~ω and the

momentum of a photon is p = h/λ = ~k. We can rewrite Eq. (2) using these relations:

E(x, t) = E0e

Substituting this into Eq. (1), we ﬁnd

for a particle with zero rest mass, which is reassuring since light is made of photons, and

photons travel at the speed of light in vacuum, which is only possible for particles of zero

rest mass.

We now assume with de Broglie that frequency and energy, and wavelength and mo-

mentum, are related in the same way for classical particles as for photons, and consider

a wave equation for non-zero rest mass particles. That means, we want to end up with
E 2 = p2c2 + m2c4 instead of just E 2 = p2c2. Since we do not deal with an electric ﬁeld any

more, we give the solution to our wave equation a new name, say Ψ, and simply call it the

wave function. In doing so, we have exploited that Eq. (8) is homogenous, and hence the

units of the function operated upon are arbitrary. Instead of Eq. (9), we would now like

In the discussion of light as a wave or a collection of photons, it turns out that the square

of the electric ﬁeld is proportional to the number of photons. By anology, we demand that

be normalizable to unit probability. Then, the probability that the particle is located some-

as it should be.

Removing restriction to one dimension and rearranging, we recognize this as the Klein-

Gordon equation for a free particle,

The Klein-Gordon equation is a relativistic equation, the Schr¨odinger equation is not. So

to ultimately arrive at the Schr¨odinger equation, we must make the assumptions necessary

to establish a non-relativistic equation.

The ﬁrst step in considering the non-relativistic case is to approximate E 2 = p2c2 + m2c4

as follows:

that p2 ≪ m2c2. This means that the leading term in Eq. (21), exp(−imc2t/~), will oscillate
much faster than the last term, exp(iT t/~). Taking advantage of this, we can write

Again rearranging and generalizing to three spatial dimensions, we ﬁnally arrive at the

Schr¨odinger equation for a free particle (zero potential):

where the non-relativistic wave function φ is also constrained to the condition that it be

normalizable to unit probability.

IV. CONCLUSION

The simple derivation of the Schr¨odinger equation provided here requires only basic

knowledge of the electromagnetic scalar wave equation and the basics of Einstein’s special

theory of relativity. Both of these topics, and the approximations used in our derivation, are

commonly covered prior to a ﬁrst course in quantum mechanics. Taking the approach that

we have outlined exposes students to the reasoning employed by the founders themselves.

7

Though much has been done to reﬁne our understanding of quantum mechanics, taking

a step back and thinking through the problem the way they did has merit if our goal as

educators is to produce the next generation of Schr¨odingers.

We have glossed over the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics, which is dealt

with superbly in any number of the standard textbooks, and particularly well in Griﬃths’

text1. We have also considered only single particles. Many independent particles are a

trivial extension of what we have shown here, but in the presence of interparticle coupling,

quantum statistical mechanics is a distraction we can do without, given the narrow objective

outlined in the title of this paper. Spin, which is relevant for a fully relativistic treatment

of the electron or when more than one particle is considered, has also not been discussed.

An obvious next step would be to consider a particle in a potential, but we believe that

doing so would result in diminishing returns due to the added complications a potential

introduces. What we have shown here is the missing content for the lecture on day one in

an introductory quantum mechanics course. Spin, interparticle coupling, and potentials are

already adequately covered elsewhere.

APPENDIX A: THE ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE EQUATION

The wave equation governing electromagnetic waves in free space is derived from

Maxwell’s equations in free space, which are:

,

∇ × E = −∂B
∂ t
∂E
∂ t

1
c2
∇ · E = 0,

∇ × B =

,

∇ · B = 0,

(A1)

(A2)

(A3)

(A4)

where c is the speed of light in vacuum, E is the electric ﬁeld, and B is the magnetic ﬁeld.

The ﬁrst equation embodies Faraday’s law and illustrates the generation of a voltage by a

changing magnetic ﬁeld. This equation is the basis of electric generators, inductors, and

transformers. The second equation embodies Ampere’s law and is the magnetic analogy of

the ﬁrst equation. It explains, for example, why there is a circulating magnetic ﬁeld sur-

rounding a wire with electrical current running through it. It is the basis of electromagnets

and the magnetic poles associated with the rotating ion core in the earth. The last two

8

equations are embodiments of Gauss’ law for electricity and for magnetism, respectively.

In the case of electricity, it is consistent with Coulomb’s law and stipulates that charge is

a source for the electric ﬁeld. If charges are present, then the right-hand side of Eq. (A3)

is non-zero and proportional to the charge density. The magnetic case is often referred to

as the “no magnetic monopoles” law. Since there are no magnetic monopoles (intrinsic

magnetic charge carriers), Eq. (A4) always holds.

Applying the curl operator to both sides of Eq. (A1) and substituting ∇×B from Eq. (A2),

we ﬁnd:

∇ × (∇ × E) = − 1
c2

∂2E
∂2t

.

Next, we apply the familiar vector identity21, ∇ × (∇ × (cid:3)) = ∇(∇ · (cid:3)) − ∇2(cid:3), where (cid:3) is

any vector, to the left hand side of Eq. (A5):

From Eq. (A3), this reduces to:

∇ × (∇ × E) = ∇(∇ · E) − ∇2E.

∇2E − 1
c2

∂2E
∂2t

= 0,

which is the electromagnetic wave equation.

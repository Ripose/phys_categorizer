As a sequel to investigations in factorizing ordinary homogeneous linear diﬀerential
equations of the second order∗, I here indicate a quadruple of factorizations of the
hypergeometric equation, the one that determines Gauss’s function F (α, β, γ, x), of
which most of the functions occurring in physics are either special or limiting cases.
The equation reads

x(1 − x)y

+ [γ − (α + β + 1)x]y

− αβy = 0 .

In physical applications x is usually restricted to

Comparing the coeﬃcients the following four alternatives are oﬀered: -

It will be realized that it is the factorizations (3) and (4) which lend themselves
to the recurrent process described earlier. For they are obtained from one another
by reversing the order of the ﬁrst order operators in (9) and changing the value
of b by ±2, whilst a and c are unchanged.
(From (6) that means that γ alone
is changed, α and β remaining constant.) If the particular problem is such as to
warrant B ≥ 0, the recurrent process, in one or the other direction, must lead to a
function for which

From this key-function the other solutions are obtained by repeated application of
the other operator.

The factorizations (9), (10) must not be regarded as the factorizations of Gauss’s

equation. They belong to the particular density

according to (7). There are bound to exist others belonging to other density func-
tions. They are not obtained just by a change of the dependent variable

This is a trivial transformation, which does not yield anything new.

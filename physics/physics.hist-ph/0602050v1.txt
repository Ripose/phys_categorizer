Abstract

This paper is centered on some historical aspects of nuclear masses, and their
relations to major discoveries. Besides nuclear reactions and decays, the heart of
mass measurements lies in mass spectrometry, the early history of which will be
reviewed ﬁrst. I shall then give a short history of the mass unit which has not always
been deﬁned as one twelfth of the carbon-12 mass. When combining inertial masses
from mass spectrometry with energy diﬀerences obtained in reactions and decays,
the conversion factor between the two is essential. The history of the evaluation of
the nuclear masses (actually atomic masses) is only slightly younger than that of
the mass measurements themselves. In their modern form, mass evaluations can
be traced back to 1955. Prior to 1955, several tables were established, the oldest
one in 1935.

1 The history of nuclear masses

The history of nuclear masses is almost as old as that of nuclear physics itself. It started
with the development of mass spectrography in the late 1910’s1. Mass spectrography
itself was born in 1898 from the works of Wilhelm Wien. He analyzed, with a magnet,
the so-called ‘channel rays’2 discovered 12 years earlier by Eugen Goldstein.

In the following, I shall give the important steps in the early history of mass spec-
trometry with special focus on nuclear masses. The guideline will be given by the
discoveries in physics that thrived on them, rather than by the techniques or results
for themselves.

1Writing about history is a particular exercise, not straightforward for scientists. Stating “The
history of nuclear masses is as old as nuclear physics” depends of course on deﬁnition. A.H. Wapstra
remarked that: “One could argue that it started in 1869 when Mendeleiev published the periodical system
of elements, in which (average) atomic masses were the basis.” I hope that, in this historical sketch, I
have not deviated too far from the truth.

First mass spectrographs
In 1907, Joseph John Thomson3 built a spectrograph with aligned magnetic and electric
ﬁelds, having ions of the same species focused on the photographic plate along parabo-
las, see Fig. 1. The resolving power of this spectrograph was around R = 10 − 20. In

1912, he obtained mass spectra of several gas compounds: N2, O2, CO, CO2,. . . and
was able to observe negatively-charged and also multiply-charged ions. One year later
(1913) he made one of the most important discoveries in nuclear physics; he observed
neon at two very diﬀerent masses, A = 20 and A = 22. This was the discovery of “iso-
topism”4 from direct observation of two diﬀerent nuclidic species for the same element.
3J.J. Thomson was known already for his discovery of the electron in 1897, when he found that
cathode rays were made of negative charged particles. He later built the plum-pudding model. An
experiment of his former student, Ernest Rutherford, in 1911, showed that this model was not right.
4Frederick Soddy was the ﬁrst to use the word “isotope”. He discovered, in 1910, that the average
mass of natural lead (that we know today to be a mixture of four isotopes), and of lead obtained in
the decay of uranium or of thorium diﬀered beyond possible experimental uncertainties. He considered

2

Then, a long series of improvements followed which increased the resolving power

and the sensitivity of the mass spectrographs and mass spectrometers5.

The ﬁrst of these improvements was introduced by Arthur Jeﬀrey Dempster, at the
University of Chicago, who, in 1918, built the ﬁrst mass spectrometer. Low-energy
ions were accelerated to high energy (500 to 1750 volts) and deﬂected by a constant
magnetic ﬁeld. They were thus almost mono-energetic. A resolving power of R = 100
was achieved by this spectrometer6.

In 1919 Francis William Aston, who was J.J. Thomson’s graduate student at Cam-
bridge, built an instrument that was able to focus ions of the same species, indepen-
dently of their velocity spread (energy focusing). This increased the resolving power of
his spectrograph up to R = 130. He thus obtained relative precisions of 10−3 in mass
measurements7 with his ﬁrst apparatus, see Fig. 2.

With this limited precision he obtained two of the most remarkable results. First, he
was able to restore the “whole number rule”: all masses (except hydrogen, see below)
are whole numbers (which is true at this level of 10−3), and a fractional ‘chemical’
mass, like 35.5 for chlorine, is in reality a mixture of the two isotopes at A = 35 and 37
with ratios 3/4 and 1/4. The second remarkable result, and probably one of the most
important discovery for the story and the evolution of the Sun and the solar system,
is that hydrogen is an exception, with a mass of 1.008 (as always, based on 16O= 16).
And this value “agrees with the value accepted by chemists” [2]. It was the theoretician
and astronomer Arthur Stanley Eddington, searching for a way out of the scientiﬁc
crisis concerning the age of the Sun, who immediately gave the answer. He calculated
[3] that the unaccounted energy necessary for the extraordinary long lifespan of the Sun
was due to “sub-atomic energy”: “There is suﬃcient (energy) in the Sun to maintain
its output of heat for 15 billion years. . . . Aston has further shown conclusively that the
mass of the helium atom is less than the sum of the masses of the 4 hydrogen atoms
which enter into it.. . . There is a loss of mass in the synthesis amounting to about 1
part in 120, the atomic weight of hydrogen being 1.008 and that of helium just 4.. . . We
can therefore at once calculate the quantity of energy liberated when helium is made out
of hydrogen. If 5 per cent of a star’s mass consists initially of hydrogen atoms, which

these “isotopes” to be a peculiarity of radioactive materials: their nature was not understood at that
time as due to diﬀerent nuclidic species.

5The detector in a mass spectrograph is a photographic plate where ions of diﬀerent masses strike at
diﬀerent locations. Whereas in mass spectrometers a spectrum is constructed by varying a parameter
responsible for the acceleration or the deﬂection of the ions. The variations of ionic current at a ﬁxed
position is then recorded by means of an electrometer. The advantage of the photographic plate is its
ability to simultaneously record lines corresponding to various ionic species. Also, in earlier times, the
precision in the position of the lines was twice better. Only much later (see below) will the precision in
the position of an electronically recorded peak gain several order of magnitudes. F.W. Aston in Ref. [1],
p. 38: “ . . . the word ‘mass spectrograph’ has lost the original restrictions intended by the writer when
he introduced it in 1920, and is now loosely applied to any method of positive ray analysis, even, by a
quite unnecessary anachronism, to the parabola method. It is best restricted to those forms of apparatus
capable of producing a focused mass spectrum of lines on a photographic plate. An apparatus in which
the focused beam of rays is brought up to a ﬁxed slit, and there detected and measured electrically is best
termed a ‘mass spectrometer’. The ﬁrst of these was devised by Dempster . . . though the term was not
introduced till much later.”

6Dempster’s second apparatus, in 1922, reached R = 160 and precisions of 6 × 10−4.
7J.-L. Costa, in 1925, built in Paris, an improved similar spectrograph and gained a factor two in

resolving power and a precision of 3 × 10−4.

are gradually being combined to form more complex elements, the total heat liberated
will more than suﬃce for our demands, and we need look no further for the source of a
star’s energy.”

With his second spectrograph, built in 1925, Aston achieved a resolving power of
R = 600 and could thus perform mass measurements with a relative precision of 10−4.
He could then observe that the actual masses were shifted by some 8 × 10−4 from the
positions corresponding to full numbers, discovering thus, in 1927, the “mass defect”8,
see Fig. 3. (Aston built a third instrument in 1937 and reached R = 2000).

The ensemble of masses obtained by Aston were determinant in the discovery of
closed shells by Walter M. Elsasser in Paris in 1933: Z = 2 and 8 (corresponding
to mass numbers 4 and 16) in Ref. [4]-a, see Fig. 4; Z = 20, 28 and 50 in Ref. [4]-b.
Elsasser also showed, in an independent study, that Z = 82 and N = 126 correspond
to shell closures based on the alpha decay energies, see Ref. [5]. “One of the main
nuclear features which led to the development of the shell structure is the existence of
what are usually called the magic numbers. That such numbers exist was ﬁrst remarked
by Elsasser in 1933.” [6]. Strangely enough, the concept of shells was dropped by the
physicists of that time who were satisﬁed with the liquid drop model, which seemed to
eﬃciently describe ﬁssion. Shells were rediscovered 14 years later, in 1948, by Maria
Goeppert-Mayer [7] when she examined a variety of observables, including Elsasser’s
publications, looking closely at the systematics of binding energies. The complete set of
arguments, none of them individually conclusive in her opinion, was convincing enough
8Aston called the shift “packing fraction” deﬁned as the percentage of deviation of the masses from
whole numbers (choosing 16O= 16, a convention established by Aston and that lasted until 1960, see
below) expressed in parts per 10 000.

Magic numbers are much better demonstrated, nowadays, in the sudden decrease in
the separation energies10 after these numbers, similar to the ionization potential after
ﬁlling each atomic shell and responsible for the table of Mendeleiev.

In 1932, Kenneth T. Bainbridge combined a Wien-type velocity ﬁlter to a semi-
circular magnet spectrograph and reached a resolving power of R = 600 and a 10−4
relative precision on masses. The measurements he performed allowed him to verify
experimentally the equivalence of mass and energy. F.W. Aston in Ref. [1] p. 85, says
about K.T. Bainbridge: “By establishing accurate comparisons of the masses of the
light particles concerned in nuclear disintegrations, particularly that of 7Li, discovered
by Cockcroft and Walton, he achieved a noteworthy triumph in the experimental proof
of the fundamental theory of Einstein of the equivalence of mass and energy.”

Double-focusing spectrographs

The general idea then, in the early 30’s, was to build a spectrograph that would fo-
cus not only in velocity (energy) but also in direction: the “double-focusing” mass
spectrograph.
In a very short time interval, both concepts and designs ﬂourished.
Richard F.K. Herzog developed the theory of focusing in 1934. Then, simultaneously,
and independently, three apparatuses were built: one by Arthur J. Dempster11 in
Chicago, in 1935, yielding a resolving power of R = 3 000, see Fig. 5, right; another by
Kenneth T. Bainbridge and Edward B. Jordan, at Harvard, in 1936, with a diﬀerent
geometry, achieving R = 10 000 and a mass precision of 10−5, see Fig. 5, left12; the ﬁnal
by Josef H.E. Mattauch and Richard F.K. Herzog, in Vienna, in 1936, with a resolving
power of R = 6 000, for their ﬁrst spectrograph13.

Mass measurements with a precision of 10−5 were routinely achieved then. The most
remarkable result obtained by Dempster in 1938, only 3 years after commissioning
his spectrograph, was a greatly improved “packing fraction” curve, see Fig. 6, that
exhibited structures not seen in Aston’s (Fig. 3). It is interesting to compare this 1938
curve to the “modern” one of Duckworth of 1958, Fig. 7.

Alfred O. Nier adopted, in the late 40’s, the mass spectrometry’s detection technique
(for the ﬁrst time after the early Dempster’s 1918 spectrometer, see above). With his
ﬁrst double-focusing device, he obtained a resolving power of R = 14 000; and, with his
9It was actually Eugene Paul Wigner who coined the term “magic number”. The physicists com-
munity at that time favored the liquid-drop model. “Wigner too believed in the liquid drop model, but
he recognized, from the work of Maria Mayer, the very strong evidence for the closed shells. It seemed
a little like magic to him, and that is how the words ‘Magic Numbers’ were coined.”,
said Steven A.
Moszkowski, who was a student of Maria Goeppert-Mayer, in a talk presented at the APS meeting
in Indianapolis, May 4, 1996. The rediscovery of “magic numbers”, lead M. Goeppert-Mayer herself,
and independently J.Hans D. Jensen in Europe, one year later in 1949, to the construction of the shell
model with strong spin-orbit coupling, and to the Nobel prize they shared with Wigner in 1963.

11R.C. Barber comments [10]: “Following the ﬁrst instruments, there were several that were developed
with partial focusing based on simple geometric ideas. The development of the theory of focusing, by
Herzog in 1934, gave rise to a generation of instruments in the late 30’s that made use of the new
insights.”

12four years later E.B. Jordan reached R = 30 000.
13several devices followed, built along the same line, yielding as much as R = 100 000.

second enlarged version in 1956, R = 75 000.

Another important contribution to nuclear physics was brought by Benjamin G. Hogg
and Henry E. Duckworth [13], in 1954, when they discovered nuclear-shape deforma-
tion in the rare-earth region after N = 90, with a Dempster-type double-focusing mass
spectrograph, see Fig. 8: “The extra stability in the heavier rare-earth region is not ad-
equately explained on a strict one-particle picture”. They associated this extra stability
with predicted “mixing of conﬁgurations”.

Mass spectrometry of unstable nuclides - New spectrometers

In the early 1970’s Robert Klapisch and Catherine Thibault [16] coupled, for the ﬁrst
time, a classical mass spectrometer to an accelerator (Fig. 9), the PS at Cern, to
measure the masses of unstable species. They discovered that the magicity at N = 20

disappeared for Na isotopes. For my PhD thesis [17], in 1981 in the same group, I
coupled a Mattauch-Herzog double-focusing spectrometer to Isolde-II, also at Cern
(Fig. 10), obtaining a resolving power of R = 60 000. However, for the faint beams of
radioactive species, I widened the slits and achieved a typical value of R = 20 000 during
operation. I found in the series of Rubidium isotopes a subshell closure at N = 56 and
a deformation starting at N = 60.

In principle, history stops where the historian’s own history starts. Even more so
when the historian is an actor in the considered domain. But let me mention some of
the most important steps that happened since then.

Around 1980, J¨urgen Kluge [18] had the great idea to exploit the fantastic resolving
power of Penning traps14 in order to perform nuclidic mass measurements. Before the
end of that decade, he and his group eﬀectively obtained masses of unstable nuclear
species with unprecedented precisions [20].

In the late 1980’s, Dave Pritchard [21] at MIT built a Penning trap for stable
species, with which the incredible relative precision of 10−10 for masses up to A = 40
was obtained. Almost simultaneously Gerald Gabrielse [22] built a trap that he installed
at Cern close to an antiproton factory, to compare the mass of the proton with that
14The “Penning trap”, ﬁrst designed in 1949, is an instrument that combines an electric and a
magnetic ﬁeld in such a way that ions are trapped in a very small volume. Its development lead to
one of the most drastic change in the landscape of mass spectrometry. The device received its name
after Frans M. Penning who, in 1936, ‘trapped’ electrons in a magnetic ﬁeld to increase their path in
vacuum and thus increase the sensitivity of ionization vacuum gauges. (See the more detailed history
of ion traps in Ref. [19]).

pass through the exit slit. They are then transported through iron, concrete and cadmium shielding
to a station where they are refocused and counted one by one by a high gain ion multiplier. From
Ref. [16].

of the antiproton with a precision of 9 × 10−11, which is remarkable for a species so
diﬃcult to isolate in our matter-dominated universe15. He could thus prove the CPT
conservation for the masses at this level of precision.

Today, Penning traps dominate the landscape of mass spectrometry, not only for
mass measurements, but in almost all ﬁelds using mass spectrometers. Just to be
complete,
let us mention the other important developments in mass spectrometry:
the time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer of A.E. Cameron and and D.F. Eggers (1948), the
radio-frequency mass spectrometer of Lincoln Smith (1960); and the so-called “Schottky

mass spectrometry” (1994), at Gsi using the Esr storage ring as a spectrometer16.

In parallel to the development of mass spectrometry, important development in ion
sources extended the study to all types of elements. One can mention here the work of
Alfred O. Nier, in 1940, on electron-impact ion sources17.

Fig. 11 illustrates the increase of precision obtained in the last 70 years in the
determination of the masses of 14N and 28Si. Strikingly, on the average, one order of
magnitude has been gained every 10 years, from 400 and 600 µu respectively in 1937
to 0.6 and 2 nu in 2003. The precision in the mass of 28Si is important in view of
the redeﬁnition of the last non-microscopic SI unit, the kilogram. One can remark a
seemingly saturation of the precision in 28Si after 1970 and for almost 20 years (the
“plateau” at 0.7 keV), and a very rapid recovery in 1995 due to the MIT Penning trap
work. Extrapolating the global tendency, one might expect a precision of 10−11 or
0.2 nu in 2005, and that we will reach a precision of 10−12 in 2015. As a matter of
fact a paper just published [23] shows that ratio of masses could be determined with
a precision of 7 × 10−12, opening the possibilities to determine the mass of 28Si with a
precision close to this number.

to the irregular arrival of electrons at the anode of thermionic tubes that is called “shot noise”. In
Schottky mass spectrometry, ions circulate in a ring. At each turn, a detector consisting of pick-up
electrodes (called “Schottky” electrodes), records their time of passing. The rotation frequencies are
thus determined. Therefore, strictly speaking, Schottky is not the name of a spectrograph, but that of
a detection device, the spectrograph being the storage ring.

17“The construction of these instruments (spectrometers built in the mid 1950’s) was concurrent
with new developments in ion optics, where the study of the eﬀects of second order aberrations and of
fringing ﬁelds were being pursued vigorously. ... The important development of vacuum and electronic
technology during the WWII years led to enormous improvements in the post-war instruments.” [10].

2 A short history of the mass unit

A mass measured by mass spectrometry is determined as an inertial mass, from its
movement characteristics in an electro-magnetic ﬁeld. More exactly, the quantity mea-
sured “directly” is the ratio of the mass of the nuclide of interest to a well known mass.
The result is then expressed in ‘uniﬁed atomic mass’ (u)18, or its sub-unit, µu.

Mass measurements can also be obtained “indirectly” as diﬀerences in energy be-
tween neighboring nuclides, either by measuring a decay energy or a reaction energy.
An energy relation is thus established between the mass we want to determine and a
well known nuclidic mass. This energy relation is then expressed in electronvolts (eV).
Two units are thus used in atomic mass measurements. We shall examine them

separately and discuss how they are related.

The mass unit is deﬁned, since 1960, by 1 u = M(12C)/12, as one twelfth of the
mass of one free atom of carbon-12 in its atomic and nuclear ground-state. Before 1960,
as Wapstra once told me, two mass units were deﬁned: the physical one M(16O)/16,
and the chemical one which represented one sixteenth of the average mass of a stan-
dard mixture of the three stable isotopes of oxygen19. Physicists could not convince
the chemists to drop their unit; “The change would mean millions of dollars in the sale
of all chemical substances”, said the chemists, which is indeed true! Joseph H.E. Mat-
tauch, the American chemist Truman P. Kohman and Aaldert H. Wapstra [38] then
calculated that, if M(12C)/12 was chosen, the change would be ten times smaller for
chemists, and in the opposite direction. . . That lead to uniﬁcation; ‘u’ stands therefore,
oﬃcially, for ‘uniﬁed mass unit’ ! To be complete, let us mention that the chemical-
mass spectrometry community (e.g. bio-chemistry, polymer chemistry,. . . ) often use
the dalton20 (symbol Da), which, whatever is claimed, serves actually to determine the
number of nucleons in a molecule, with not too much concern about the exact value of
the obtained mass compared to 12C. It is thus not strictly the same as ‘u’. As a matter
of fact, some attempts were made to determine atomic masses with equipment used
in chemistry. However, the values obtained [39, 40, 41] appeared later to be at strong
variance compared to modern results.

The energy unit is the electronvolt. Until recently, the relative precision in M − A
expressed in keV was, for several nuclides, less good than the same quantity expressed
in mass units. The choice of the volt for the energy unit (the electronvolt) is not
evident. One might expect the use of the international volt V, but one can also

18Quite often people write erroneously ‘a.m.u’ or ‘amu’ instead of ‘u’.
19R.C. Barber’s comment [10]: “The chemists used 1/16 of the mass of oxygen as the mass unit,
beginning with very early work, back when they literally weighed the components in chemical reactions.
As soon as Aston saw the evidence for isotopes of oxygen he realized that the deﬁnition, based on a
‘natural’ abundance ratio for the three isotopes, was inherently imprecise. He deﬁned all of his masses
relative to 16O. This situation went on for decades. The chemists were untroubled by the slight diﬀerence,
while the physicists were content with the Aston deﬁnition for a long time. However, with increasing
precision, it was realized that mass spectroscopic comparisons were always referred to a ‘standard’,
known hydrocarbon molecule that always involved 12C. To convert from the deﬁned standard 16O to
12C, one had to study the 12C1H4−16O doublet that was not particularly well known. If one changed to
the 12C deﬁnition, there was an immediate ‘free’ improvement in precision.”

in proportions following simple laws, and was the ﬁrst to create a table of (very approximate) atomic
weights.

choose the standard volt V90 as maintained in national laboratories for standards
and deﬁned by adopting an exact value for the constant (2e/h) in the relation be-
tween frequency and voltage in the Josephson eﬀect. In the 1999 table of standards
[42]: 2e/h = 483597.9 (exact) GHz/V90. An analysis by E.Richard Cohen and Aaldert
H. Wapstra [43] showed that all precision measurements of reaction and decay energies
were calibrated in such a way that they can be more accurately expressed in standard
volt. Also, the precision in the conversion factor between mass unit and standard volt,
V90, is more accurate than the conversion of the mass unit to the international volt V:

1 u = 931 494.009 0 ± 0.007 1 keV90
1 u = 931 494.013 ± 0.037

keV

This has not always been the case. In the early days of the evaluation of masses, two
independent evaluations and adjustments were often performed, separately for reaction
and decay data, and for mass spectrometric measurements. Comparing the two allowed
one to derive a value for the conversion factor, which could then be compared to the
one derived by other, more precise, methods [42]. The present computer program for
the least-squares ﬁt of the mass adjustment still contains an option that allows this
conversion factor to be a free parameter.

The reader will ﬁnd more information on the energy unit, and also some historical

facts about the electronvolt, in the Ame2003 [44], page 134.

3 The history of the evaluation of atomic masses

It was felt very early that establishing lists of properties for nuclei was not only useful,
but necessary. Several collections were thus published. Below is a list of the atomic mass
compilations. The ﬁrst one, to my knowledge, in which data from mass spectrometry
and nuclear reaction and decay data were combined, is the 1937 table of Milton Stanley
Livingston and Hans Albrecht Bethe [25].

“The Plutonium project table”

“Table of atomic nuclei”

In the early 1950’s it was found that the many relations (direct and indirect) overde-
termined the mass value of many nuclides. Aaldert H. Wapstra established a procedure
using a least-squares method to solve the problem of overdetermination. One of the
side-beneﬁts of the overdetermination is to get a check of the consistency among the
various results. The ﬁrst table of atomic masses using this method is dated 1955 [28].
Since then, A.H. Wapstra has carried on the evaluation of the experimental masses
of nuclei - to be more precise their atomic masses - in what we call the Atomic Mass
Evaluation (Ame) with various students or collaborators, until I joined him in 1981.

13

We published together every 10 years since then (1983, 1993 and 2003) a complete set
of masses and of the data from which they are deduced.

The list below gives the main “modern” evaluations of atomic masses following the
general lines as ﬁrst deﬁned in Ref. [28], well described in Ref. [49] and slightly reﬁned
since then (see the most recent and most complete of those in the Ame2003 [44]):

With the development of accelerators and the production of an increasing number
of unstable species, excited nuclear states were increasingly populated. Those with
half-lives long compared to typical electromagnetic transitions (femtoseconds fs to pi-
coseconds ps) started to play a rˆole in the measurement of decay energies. These
long-lived excited states are called the excited isomers21.
In many measurements of
decay energies, it is not well established if the emitting level from the mother nucleus
is the ground-state or an isomeric level. Often simultaneous measurement of the half-
life or of the spin (through the transition probabilities) removes the ambiguity. The
problem, however, becomes worse in mass spectrometry where the measurement may
only yield one line for a mixture of closely lying isomers. The interpretation is then
diﬃcult22. Only in favorable cases, corrections could be estimated.

As a consequence, not only had the Ame to handle several isomers for each nuclidic
species, but also one needed a unique and consistent description of the various isomers
that were involved in the Ame. Therefore the Nubase database was created in 1993
and published since then in 1997 and 2003 [53], the latter in complete synchronization
with the Ame2003.

4 Conclusion

“The history of nuclear masses is almost as old as that of nuclear physics itself.” was the
ﬁrst sentence of the introduction. The conclusion can complement this statement in that
the history of nuclear masses and the history of its most important contributor, namely
mass spectrometry, have continuously fed nuclear physics with major discoveries. Each
21Here is another example of common misuse of terms. Strictly, we should distinguish ground-state
isomer and excited isomers, as chemists distinguish left-handed and right-handed ones. Often people
call ‘isomer’ the excited one.
the relation of two or more
(the Merriam-Webster says “isomerism:
nuclides with the same mass numbers and atomic numbers but diﬀerent energy states and rates of
radioactive decay”).

22Then, it is fully worthy to repeat the experiment with increased resolving power, even at the cost of
lower counting rate and decreased precision. The ﬁnal result will be more accurate. See the remarkable
example of Hg isomers in Ref. [52].

progress in building new spectrometers, increasing resolving power or sensitivity or
both, has led, as shown in this paper, to important new physics. We have seen some
of them: the nature of channel rays; the discovery of isotopism; the restoration of the
whole number rule; the explanation of the age of the Sun; the discovery of mass defect
and the experimental proof of the equivalence of mass and energy; the discovery of the
magic numbers; the discovery of deformations; the discovery of a subshell closure; the
discovery that magic numbers might disappear; . . . Much more could be said on recent
breakthroughs in our understanding of physics brought about by mass measurements,
the history of which is still to be written.

In parallel to this history, and strongly related to it, is the history of the atomic
mass evaluation that establishes and ascertains our conﬁdence in the measured masses.

Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Aaldert H. Wapstra who, since 1981, made me discover the
fascinating ﬁeld of mass evaluation. Doing this job makes us see almost all aspects of
the nuclear physics problems and many also beyond. Often, we have the privilege to be
the ﬁrst ones to see new phenomena. Therefore, thank you Aaldert for having let me
enter this beautiful domain. Now, we would both be so happy to have someone willing
to share with us the same passion.

I want to thank J¨urgen Kluge, to whom this paper is dedicated in honor of his 65th
anniversary. J¨urgen invited me, in 1987, just after the ﬁrst run with the Penning trap
at Isolde, to join his team and enjoy the ﬂourishing program and the tremendous
amount of data he and his group obtained with this splendid spectrometer.

I wish also to thank those who helped me in this work: ﬁrst of all Lutz Schweikhard
for asking me to write this piece of history and for several very useful suggestions; and
R.C. Barber, F. Everling, C. Gaulard, D. Lunney, C. Thibault and A.H. Wapstra for
reading, and making corrections and suggestions to improve the manuscript.

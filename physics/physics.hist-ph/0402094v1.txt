Abstract

We generalize the Stueckelberg formalism in the (1/2, 1/2)
representation of the Lorentz Group. Some relations to other
modern-physics models are found.

Somebody may think that I am presenting well-known things. There-
fore, I am going to give some overview of my previous works in order you to
understand motivations better. In ref. [1] I derived the Maxwell-like equa-
tions with the additional gradient of a scalar ﬁeld χ from the ﬁrst principles.

that lead to (1a-1d), when m = 0. We can continue writing down equations
for higher spins in a similar fashion.

On this basis we are ready to generalize the BW formalism [2,3]. Why is
that convenient? In ref. [4] I presented the mapping between the WTH equa-
tion [5] and the equations for AST ﬁelds. The equation for a 6-component
ﬁeld function is2

the requirement that the equation gives the state with the classical anomalous
magnetic moment, then m2 = m1(1+ 3

one can propose a generalized equation:

[iγµ∂µ + a + b✷ + γ5(c + d✷)]Ψ = 0 ,

✷ = ∂µ∂µ; and, perhaps, even that of higher orders in derivatives.

One can derive equations for the dual tensor ˜Fαβ, which are similar
to (9a,9b), refs. [20a,7].

If Ψ(6) has no deﬁnite parity, e. g., Ψ(6) = column(E + iB B + iE ),

Depending on the relation between A and B and on which parity
solution do we consider, the WTH equations may describe diﬀerent
mass states. For instance, when A = 7 and B = 8 we have the second
mass state (m′)2 = 4m2/3.

We tried to ﬁnd relations between the generalized WTH theory and other
spin-1 formalisms. Therefore, we were forced to modify the Bargmann-
Wigner formalism [6,7]. For instance, we introduced the sign operator in
the Dirac equations which are the input for the formalism for symmetric
2-rank spinor:

[iγµ∂µ + ǫ1m1 + ǫ2m2γ5]αβ Ψβγ = 0 ,
[iγµ∂µ + ǫ3m1 + ǫ4m2γ5]γβ Ψαβ = 0 ,

Moreover, it appears that the properties of the polarization vectors with
respect to parity operation depend on the choice of the spin basis. For
instance, in refs. [8,7] the following momentum-space polarization vectors

There exists the mapping between the WTH formalism for S = 1 and
the AST ﬁelds of four kinds (provided that the solutions of the WTH
equations are of the deﬁnite parity).

Their massless limits contain additional solutions comparing with the
Maxwell equations. This was related to the possible theoretical exis-
tence of the Ogievetski˘ı-Polubarinov-Kalb-Ramond notoph [10].

In some particular cases (A = 0, B = 1) massive solutions of diﬀerent
parities are naturally divided into the classes of causal and tachyonic
solutions.

If we want to take into account the solutions of the WTH equations
of diﬀerent parity properties, this induces us to generalize the BW,
Proca and Duﬃn-Kemmer formalisms.

(0, 1/2), (1, 0)

In the (1/2, 0)
(0, 1) etc. representations it is possi-
ble to introduce the parity-violating frameworks. The corresponding
solutions are the mixture of various polarization states.

The addition of the Klein-Gordon equation to the (S, 0)
tions may change the theoretical content even on the free level. For
instance, the higher-spin equations may actually describe various spin

There also exist the mappings between the WTH solutions of unde-
ﬁned parity and the AST ﬁelds, which contain both tensor and dual
tensor. They are eight.

I hope, this is enough for the antecedents. Everybody has already un-
∂µχ term in the electrodynamics and in

derstood the importance of ˜Aµ ∼
the Proca theory.

III. THE THEORY OF 4-VECTOR FIELD.

First of all, we show that the equation for the 4-vector ﬁeld can be
presented in a matrix form. Recently, S. I. Kruglov proposed [12,13]4 a
general form of the Lagrangian for 4-potential ﬁeld Bµ, which also contains
the spin-0 state. Initially, we have (provided that derivatives commute)

α∂µ∂νBν + β∂2

ν Bµ + γm2Bµ = 0 .

(15)

When ∂νBν = 0 (the Lorentz gauge) we obtain spin-1 states only. However,
if it is not equal to zero we have a scalar ﬁeld and a pseudovector potential.
We can also check this by consideration of the dispersion relations of (15).
One obtains 4+4 states (two of them may diﬀer in mass from others).

Next, one can ﬁx one of the constants α, β, γ without loosing any physical
2 and taking into account that the action

content. For instance, when α =
of the symmetrized combination of Kronecker’s δ’s

bach in 1998. See also: R. A. Berg, Nuovo Cim. A XLII, 148 (1966) and D. V.

γ-matrices are pure real; γ5-matrices are pure imaginary. In the (1/2, 1/2)
representation, we need 16 matrices to form the complete set (as opposed to
the bi-vector representation, when we have to deﬁne also γ6,αβ,µν). Please
note that in the pseudo-Euclidean metric the symmetry properties of the
γ’s and γ5’s are not the same (comparing with our consideration in the
Euclidean metric) in such a representation.

If µ = m (this depends on relations between A and B) we have the cancel-
lation of divergent parts. Thus, we can overcome the well-known diﬃculty
of the Proca theory with the massless limit.

If µ

= m we can still have a causal theory, but in this case we need more
than one equation, and should apply the method proposed in ref. [20].7
The case of the complex-valued vector ﬁeld will be reported in a separate
publication.

We observe: 1) that the indeﬁnite metric problems may appear even
on the massive level in the Stueckelberg formalism; 2) The Stueckelberg
theory has a good massless limit for propagators, and it reproduces the
handling of the indeﬁnite metric in the massless limit (the electromagnetic
4-potential case); 3) we generalized the Stueckelberg formalism (consider-
ing, at least, two equations); instead of charge-conjugate solutions we may
consider the P
conjugates. The potential ﬁeld becomes to be the
complex-valued ﬁeld, that may justify the introduction of the anti-hermitian
amplitudes.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

•

•

•

•

•

The (1/2, 1/2) representation contains both the spin-1 and spin-0
states (cf. with the Stueckelberg formalism).

Unless we take into account the fourth state (the “time-like” state,
or the spin-0 state) the set of 4-vectors is not a complete set in a
mathematical sense.

We cannot remove terms like (∂µB∗µ)(∂νBν) terms from the Lagrangian
and dynamical invariants unless apply the Fermi method, i. e., man-
ually. The Lorentz condition applies only to the spin 1 states.

We have some additional terms in the expressions of the energy-
momentum vector (and, accordingly, of the 4-current and the Pauli-
Lunbanski vectors), which are the consequence of the impossibility to
apply the Lorentz condition for spin-0 states.

Helicity vectors are not eigenvectors of the parity operator. Mean-
= 0 in the
while, the parity is a “good” quantum number, [
Fock space.

•

We are able to describe states of diﬀerent masses in this representation
from the beginning.

17

•

Various-type ﬁeld operators can be constructed in the (1/2, 1/2) rep-
resentation space. For instance, they can contain C, P and CP con-
jugate states. Even if b†λ = a†λ we can have complex 4-vector ﬁelds.8
We found the relations between creation, annihilation operators for
diﬀerent types of the ﬁeld operators Bµ.

•

Propagators have good behavious in the massless limit as opposed to
those of the Proca theory.

The detailed explanations of several claims presented in this talk will be

given in journal publications.

We review here the conjecture of electromagnetic mass by Lorentz. The philosophical perspectives
and historical accounts of this idea are described in a brief and non-technical way. It has shown that
the Lorentz mass model has taken various shapes through its journey and the goal is yet unreached.

The Nobel Prize in Physics 2004 has been awarded
to D. J. Gross, F. Wilczek and H. D. Politzer1,2 “for
the discovery of asymptotic freedom in the theory of the
strong interaction” which was published three decades
ago in 1973. This is commonly known as the Standard
Model of microphysics (and don’t be confused with the
another Standard Model of macrophysics - the Hot Big
Bang!). Based on this Standard Model of quarks where
the coupling strength of forces depends on distance it is
possible to show that at distances below 10−32 m the
strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions are “dif-
ferent facets of one universal interaction.”3,4 This imme-
diately reminds us about another Nobel Prize occasion in
Physics 1979 when S. Glashow, A. Salam and S. Wein-
berg got it “for their contributions to the theory of the
uniﬁed weak and electromagnetic interaction between el-
ementary particles, including, inter alia, the prediction
of the weak neutral current.” In this connection one can
also recall the uniﬁcation of electricity and magnetism
by Maxwell, and that of earth’s gravity and universal
gravitation by Newton.

Then, what left for the uniﬁcation scheme? Though
there has been much progress towards an uniﬁcation of
all the other forces - strong, electromagnetic and weak -
in grand uniﬁed theory but gravity remains untouched.
There are, ofcourse, problems with gravity in the sense
that unlike the other interactions it has some peculiar
properties which do not match with some standard of uni-
ﬁcation, e.g. the strength of the gravitational interaction
which is enormously weaker than any other force (Ta-
ble 1). This is the hierarchy problem. Probable answer
of this, according to the higher dimensional theories, in-
volves leaking of gravity into the extra dimensions. More-
over, the most prominent theory of gravitation, Einstein’s
general relativity, does not consider gravity as a force
rather a kind of ﬁeld for which a body rolls down along
the space-time curvature. In this background and con-
text we can look at the conjecture of Lorentz6 where he
termed the electron mass as ‘electromagnetic mass’ which
does not possess any ‘material mass’ and thus thought of
a phenomenological relationship between gravitation and
electromagnetism as long as one hundred years ago!

It may be a mere coincidence that in this same cente-
nary year of ‘electromagnetic mass’ model of Lorentz re-
lated to electron-like extended charged particle (i.e. one
of the members of lepton) Nobel Prize has been oﬀered

for quark-based Standard Model. According to this Stan-
dard Model of particle physics leptons and quarks are the
building blocks of all the matters. So, here one can see
some glimpses of hope for new uniﬁcation schemes though
should keep in mind that while Standard Model calcula-
tion is quantum mechanical one Lorentz’s treatment is
purely classical.

In the classical point of view Lorentz tried to tackle
the problem of the electrodynamics of moving bodies.
His apparent motivation was to solve the null result of
Michelson-Morley experiment keeping the existence of
ether as it is. Actually, his motivation was much deeper
as he wanted to represent an electromagnetic world view
in comparison to the Maxwellian electromagnetic theory.
Based on this philosophy Lorentz5 developed his Theory
of Electrons in 1892. For this he was awarded 1902 Nobel
along with his student Zeeman who veriﬁed the theory
in the presence of magnetic ﬁeld. The main hypothesis
of the theory, in the language of Lorentz6, is following:
“I cannot but regard the ether, which can be the seat
of an electromagnetic ﬁeld with its energy and its vibra-
tions, as endowed with a certain degree of substantially,
however diﬀerent it may be from all ordinary matter.”
Thus, he considered the electric ﬁeld vector ~E and mag-
netic ﬂux density vector ~B in this absolute ether frame
and obtained the force ~F = q[ ~E + (~v × ~B)/c], in the pres-
ence of charge q. This electromagnetic ﬁeld and hence,
in turn, force is generated by the charged particles, like
electrons. According to Einstein,7 “It is a work of such
consistency, lucidity, and beauty as has only rarely been
attained in an empirical science.” So, in this way Lorentz
tried to provide a complete theory of all electromagnetic
phenomena known at that time. Obviously, his new task
was to investigate the electrodynamical character of mov-
ing bodies under this framework of his electron theory.
As a further development of the theory Lorentz obtained
the transverse mass (actually the relativistic mass) for
electron in the form

m =

e2/6πac2
p1 − v2/c2

,

(1)

where e is the electronic charge, a it’s radius, v the ve-
locity with which electron is moving and c the velocity
of light. According to this, the spherical electron would
experience an ellipsoidal change in it’s shape while it is
in motion. In a straight forward way the relation yields

Certainly, this relation uniﬁes gravitation with electro-
magnetism. You just take out electromagnetic ﬁeld and
no gravitational ﬁeld counterpart will be left for you! For
the above result the reaction of Lorentz6 was: “... that
there is no other, no “true” or “material” mass” and
thus ‘electromagnetic mass’ got it’s birth by Lorentz.
However, historically we should mention that even be-
fore Lorentz there were other notable peoples also, who
admitted the idea of electromagnetic mass in their works.
Firstly, J. J. Thomson8 who, even in 1881, believed in the
idea of “electromagnetic inertia” and Richardson9 writes,
“For it opens up the possibility that the mass of all mat-
ter is nothing else than the electromagnetic mass of the
electrons which certainly form part, and perhaps form
the whole, of its structure.” Secondly, Abraham10 in
1903 arrived, from a diﬀerent point of view, at the same
concept that mass of a charged particle is associated with
its electromagnetic character. But his theory ultimately
suﬀered from some serious drawbacks, mainly due to the
idea of rigid structure of electron, which does not follow
the Fitzgerald- Lorentz contraction.

Now, the study of electromagnetic mass, which has a
century-long distinguished history, can be divided into
three broad categories - classical and/or semi-classical,
quantum mechanical and general relativistic. The clas-
sical period started by Thomson and via Abraham-
Lorentz-Poincar´e ended mainly by Richardson. At this
time Poincar´e, to overcome the instability and inconsis-
tency of Abraham’s model with the Lorentz transfor-
mations of special relativity, provided a mechanism to
hold the charge together by assuming the existence of
non-electromagnetic cohesive forces. On the other hand,
Richardson published an advanced level textbook - The
Electron Theory of Matter - in 1914 based on a course
of lectures at Princeton. In the idea of “electromagnetic
mass” Richardson9 had so strong belief that in his book
he deﬁnes the electron as a particle consisting “of a ge-
ometrical conﬁguration of electricity and nothing else,
whose mass, that is, is all electromagnetic.” Here we
would like to quote from an editorial note11 of Nature
reporting the 1928 Nobel prize to Richardson: “Richard-
son’s “Electron Theory of Matter” is also well known

to students of electricity and atomic physics, and al-
though published between the advent of the Bohr and
the Wilson-Sommerfeld theories of the atom and with
a strong classical bias, is still much used.” However,
the classical bias and trail was always there and even
now exists through the reexamination of, basically, the
Abraham-Lorentz model to account for the factor of 4/3
in the electromagnetic mass expression12,13. This was
initiated by 21-years-old Fermi14 in 1922 whose belief on
“the concept of electromagnetic mass” was related to a
far reaching aspiration that, “It is the basis of the elec-
tromagnetic theory of matter.” By this motivation “with
regards to the tremendous importance” of the problem
related to the discrepancy between the equation (2) and
the famous mass-energy equivalence E = mc2 he solved
it. Surprisingly enough, this important work did not re-
ceive its weightage till 196515.

The main drawback of all these electromagnetic mass
was, therefore, lying in the fact that the approach is ei-
ther purely classical or semi-classical based on special
relativistic framework and hence lacks a quantum me-
chanical description. However, there were attempts to
compute the electromagnetic mass in quantum theory of
electron, particularly, by Weisskopf16 who obtained it as
a result of ﬁeld reaction. The process as described by
Tomonaga17 is like this: “The electron, having a charge,
produces an electromagnetic ﬁeld around itself. In turn,
this ﬁeld, the so-called self-ﬁeld of the electron, inter-
acts with the electron.” This interaction is called by
Tomonaga17 as the ﬁeld reaction. He goes on to describe
the process: “Because of the ﬁeld reaction the apparent
mass of the electron diﬀers from the original mass. The
excess mass due to this ﬁeld reaction is called the elec-
tromagnetic mass of the electron and the experimentally
observed mass is the sum of the original mass and this
electromagnetic mass.” But here also the problem was re-
lated to the inﬁnite mass due to point-size electron. This
is the well known self-energy problem and Lorentz solved
it, apparently, assuming that the electron is of ﬁnite size.
Many scientists have tried to incorporate this extended
electron into the relativistic quantum theory but failed
anyway. Actually, quantum mechanics treats electron
as a point-like charged particle with spin and hence ex-
tended electron could not be accommodated within it. In
that sense, it seems that instead of describing the electron
structure in general relativity based Einstein-Maxwell
space-time either Einstein-Cartan-Maxwell or Einstein-
Maxwell-Dirac space-time will be much meaningful18, as

far as spin is concerned. However, We’ll come again to
the quantum aspect with a diﬀerent viewpoint.

The ﬁrst remarkable general relativistic approach to-
wards an electromagnetic mass was due to Einstein19.
To overcome the drawbacks of Mie’s theory Einstein pro-
posed a formalism where gravitational forces provide the
necessary stability to the electron and also the contribu-
tion to the mass comes from it. Using his well known re-
lationship between the space-time geometry and energy-
momentum tensor in a modiﬁed way

he obtained the result: “... of the energy constituting
matter three-quarters is to be ascribed to the electromag-
netic ﬁeld”. This obviously does not agree fully with the
conjecture of Lorentz. One possibility of this discrepancy
may be due to the consideration of nonelectromagnetic
origin of the self-stabilizing stresses20. Then, after a long
silence investigations again started mainly in the 1980’s
(except some scattered work even in 1960’s and 1970’s)
and a lot of papers have been published in a coherent way
by several peoples highlighting diﬀerent properties of the
models. In a nutshell, the ﬁrst and foremost character is
that unlike Einstein the total mass of the charged particle
is of electromagnetic origin. The other general proper-
ties are (1) “vacuum ﬂuid” obeying an equation of state,
ρ = −p, is taking deﬁnite role for the construction of the
model21,22; (2) “negative mass” in the central region of
the source is needed to maintain the stability against the
repulsive force of Coulomb23,24,25; (3) “repulsive gravi-
tation” produced by the negative mass of the polarized
vacuum is connected to the Poincar´e stress26. Ofcourse,
there are some examples against these general properties
where even without employing “vacuum ﬂuid” equation
of state one can construct a stable model with electro-
magnetic mass27. On the other hand, there are also ev-
idences in the literature that “negative mass” is not an
essential ingredient of the models28. An interesting ex-
tension of these type of models is that they, under suit-
able mathematical manipulations, not only yield astro-
physically important Weyl-Majumdar-Papapetrou class
of static charged dust sources29,30 but also Raissner-
Nordstr¨om-Curzon ﬁeld31, Lane-Emden model20,32 and
even Tolman-Bayin solutions33.

Let us now look at the electromagnetic mass idea
through the broad window of special relativistic mass-
energy relation E = mc2. It tells, via m = E/c2, that
mass which commonly referred to as “quantity of the
permanent substance of matter” is a kind of “trapped”
energy of any type, e.g. rest, kinetic or heat energy as
it is transferable one. Thus, comparison of this mass ex-
pression of Einstein with that of equation (1) of Lorentz
shows that regardless of its origin mass must be depended
on velocity. Then, in one way or another, Lorentz’s con-
jecture takes diﬀerent meaning with a deep root where
now “electromagnetic mass” is getting emerged into a
mass which has a global character. On the other hand,

the singularity or self-energy problem in the Lorentz’s
model, according to the modern quantum mechanics can
be rather better explained by quantum ﬂuctuations and
also contribution of electric ﬁeld energy of an electron to
its total mass can be shown to be a small part. “Thus
Lorentz’s dream, in its original form, is not realized” -
Wilczek34 put the things in this way. In view of this, let
us now see the quantum mechanical world view of mass.
The quantum electrodynamics (QED) of Standard Model
of particle physics, where chiral gauge symmetry plays an
important role, works without any mass parameter. On
the other side, in the quantum chromodynamics (QCD)
of Standard Model, quarks and gluons are thought to
be the building blocks of protons and neutrons like all
the hadrons. These hadrons contribute more than 99%
mass to the ordinary matter. The truncated QCD (or
QCD Lite), which deals with only the up-down quarks
and color gluons, do not attribute any mass to these en-
tities. These energetic but massless quarks and gluons,
therefore, give rise to masses of the protons and neutrons
through their quasi-stable equilibrium states. In the sim-
ilar way, the mass of electron now can be regarded as
excitation of an electron ﬁeld of an inﬁnite ocean of zero
point energy of vacuum. Thus, in quantum mechanics
ﬁeld or energy becomes the primary one whereas mass
is the secondary quantity. There is somewhat favorable
evidence of this in the macrocosm also. The contribution
of ordinary matter, dark matter and dark energy to the
whole volume density of the Universe, respectively, are
about 3%, 30% and 67%. Perhaps, this huge dark en-
ergy, which provides repulsive gravitation, is responsible
for the present acceleration in the expanding Universe.

So, we have journeyed a very lengthy and jig jag path of
classical, quantum, relativistic and again quantum realm
to get familiar with Lorentz’s conjecture of ‘electromag-
netic mass’ - its past and present. On the way we have
seen so many ups and downs, ﬂash and patch, enjoyed it
and frustrated also. All these are, at least, theoretically
seems to be very sound. But unless experimental evi-
dences support it nobody knows the fate of this beautiful
conjecture on the uniﬁcation of gravitational and elec-
tromagnetic interactions. Ofcourse, indirect evidence is
there in favor of this conjecture with respect to the trans-
verse mass (actually, relativistic mass in equation (1))
eﬀect by Bucharer.35 In 1908 he veriﬁed the incorrect re-
sults (rather interpretation of the results) of Kaufmann36
following the idea of Planck.37 However, some direct ex-
periments are to be performed regarding gravitational
or inertial mass, which thought to be of electromagnetic
character, to obtain more conclusive results as “...these
measurements can no longer be regarded as a conﬁrma-
tion of the assumption that all mass is of electromagnetic
origin”38.

Let us again come to the aspect of uniﬁcation. Here,
we would like to mention about Einstein who initiated
the program “...to ﬁnd all-embracing laws which unify
the whole of the physical world”39. Einstein strongly
believed that all forces of nature are rooted in gravity.

4

Therefore, he started with a non-Euclidean geometry of
space-time following his general relativistic ﬁeld theoreti-
cal approach. But it is now an unfortunate truth that he,
including scientists like Weyl, Eddington, Schr¨odinger,
not succeeded in their attempts. On the other hand,
Heisenberg believed in the group theoretical approach
and thought of uniﬁcation in the realm of elementary par-
ticles. Most probably the infrastructural facilities avail-
able at that time and the procedures adopted by these
giants were not adequate to solve this sublime problem.
What is then the best tool for searching THE ONE? Is
it relativity - the special and general both as a whole or
quantum mechanics with its variants or mixture of spe-
cial relativity with quantum mechanics i.e. relativistic
quantum mechanics or general relativity with quantum
mechanics i.e. quantum gravity or superstring theory
as a candidate of the so-called theory of everything? So
many paths and possibilities are ahead of the scientists
- but nobody knows which one is the best ﬁtting one for

solving the long lasting problem. In this respect the com-
ment by Born40 seems appropriate to quote: “Whether
one or the other of these methods will lead to the antic-
ipated “world law” must be left to future research.” Or
equally, may be, suitable to quote Feynman41: “...may
be all the mass of an electron is purely electromagnetic,
maybe the whole 0.511 Mev is due to electrodynamics.
Is it or isn’t it?” If the answer is yes, then classical
and general relativistic version of ‘electromagnetic’ mass
will take important role for uniﬁcation-goal and if it is
negative then quantum and special relativistic version of
‘transcended’ mass will be established. So, one has to
take the wait and watch policy here as time only can test
and tell about the truth.

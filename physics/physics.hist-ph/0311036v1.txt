Introduction

For several decades the solution to the problem of the ancient Babylonian
chronology was anchored to the belief in the existence of 56/64 year cycles in
the Venus Tablet of Ammisaduqa. That belief had determined the choice of
the possible chronologies, reducing them to those known as High, Middle and
Low chronologies. The earlier chronological proposals had assumed a link
between a ﬁxed lunar calendar and the 56/64 year cycles of the visibility of
Venus. One novelty of the astronomical background of the ”New” or ”Ultra-
low” chronology advocated in recent years was the understanding that the
56/64 year cycles cannot in fact be accurately recognized in the Venus Tablet
(Gasche et al. 1998; Gurzadyan 2000). This implied a deﬁnite change in
the framework of chronological debate, since the 56/64 year cycles could no
longer serve as a basis for argumentation.

We also addressed the possibility of astronomical arguments based on
ancient observations, namely, the Enuma Anu Enlil Tablets 20 and 21. The
approach depended upon extracting and analysing the astronomically most
signiﬁcant descriptors which interpreters of the tablets agreed had survived
in the descriptions of the eclipses. The analysis was based on the data pre-
served concerning the exit position of the darkening of the lunar disk and
the time recorded. These were relatively the most reliable and astronomi-

1

cally most informative since the reality of observations is that, the end of
an astronomical event is generally better recorded than its beginning. The
chronology of the Third Dynasty of Ur indicated that two lunar eclipses
should have been separated by a period of 41-44 years. Therefore the search
centered on two eclipses which could be related relatively in time. Along
with the necessary gap, the exit positions and the watchtime information
determined the choice of the eclipses of 1954 BC and 1912 BC as the most
probable candidates for the Ur III events. This strategy, i.e. exploiting the
known lunar eclipses from the omina together with the 8-year Venus-cycle
from the Venus Tablet, revealed its value in the creation of a new chronology,
suggesting that the fall of Babylon corresponded to 1499 BC (rather than
1531 or 1595 as posited by the Low and Middle Chronologies). This Ultra-
Low chronology is also compatible with such independent data as pottery
sequences, Assyrian king lists, and glyptic evidence.

2 Refraction

Here, we continue the discussion of astronomical eﬀects which can inﬂu-
ence the interpretation of the omens and even the choice of the chronology.
Particularly, we will concentrate on the role of refraction in observations
near the horizon. Observations near the horizon are the key ones for the
Venus Tablet since the latter includes the dates of the ﬁrst and last visibil-
ities of the Venus. The consideration of refraction corrections had already
led to the refutation of the megalithic lunar observatory idea (Schaefer and
Liller 1990), due to the fact that refraction exhibits variations which are
more than a magnitude higher than the values adopted previously by ar-
chaeoastronomers. Such variations are also diﬃcult to predict based on the
atmosphere models in the widely used programs of evaluation of refraction
(Garﬁnkel 1967).

We will therefore inquire whether the role of refraction can be of such
profound importance for the Venus Tablet interpretation as it was for me-
galithic astronomy. The refraction near the horizon R0 is deﬁned as

R0 = Z − 90

◦ − D,

where Z is the angular distance of the planet or of the upper limb of the
Sun from the zenith, D is the correcting factor due to the altitude of the
observer. The quantitative evaluation of refraction in a given site can be
performed by several methods, for example, via the diﬀerence in the timing

2

of the actual contact of the planet with the horizon and theoretical tables, or
the calculation of the index via the known proﬁle of the temperature using
the corresponding formulae, or the software by Schaefer (1989).

The actual observations performed by Schaefer and Liller (1990) at two
sites range for R0 from 0◦.234 to 1◦.678, with the conclusion of reasonable
variation of R0 for an unknown site about 0◦.64.

In March, 2001 we had a brief opportunity to perform observations from
the Northern Palace in Babylon, particularly we checked that the apparent
horizon in Babylon is close to the mathematical horizon due to the ﬂatness
of the site; nor can west-east asymmetry be observed. The altitude of our
location was about h=20m above the level of Euphrates, which guarantees
the smallness of the factor

D = arccos(1/(1 + h/REarth)).

Hence, one could expect that the estimations of refraction variation by
Schaefer and Liller (1990) have to be valid for this site also. Although
we did not have occasion for detailed observations, either to trace the sys-
tematic eﬀects or to collect considerable statistics, our estimation on the
site of R0 based on the actual and theoretical timing, about 0◦.6 − 0◦.8, was
in accordance with those of Schaefer and Liller (1990); inaccuracies due to
the variation of climatic conditions since the Old Babylonian period would
hardly exceed that scatter.

Turning now to the Venus Tablet and the Venus-cycles, we recall that ﬁve
synodic periods of Venus are almost equal to eight sidereal years, namely,
after 8 years the coordinates of Venus are repeated with a shift of almost
2◦.5 which yields roughly a 4 day shift in the dating. Adopting the value of
Schaefer and Liller (1990) as a typical refraction variation, 0◦.64, we see that
it will introduce inaccuracies in the dating of the rise or set of Venus ranging
from 1 to 4 or 5 days, i.e. in the dates of the ﬁrst and last visibilities. This
multiple-day inaccuracy is crucial for the link between the Venus Tablet data
and the lunar calendar, and hence for chronological purposes.

According to the Omens 1 and 57 of the Venus Tablet, Venus had its
last visibility on the 15th day and ﬁrst visibility on the 18th day of month
XI of the ﬁrst year of Ammisaduqa, i.e. it was invisible for 3 days (Reiner
and Pingree 1975). The comparison with modern calculations (Van der
Waerden 1974), links this fact with the end of March of 1701 BC, which
then, together with the assumed 56/64 periodicity became the basis of the
ﬁxing of 1702 BC, 1646 BC resp. 1638 BC, and 1582 BC, as the proposed

3

dates for the ﬁrst years of Ammisaduqa, i.e.
the High, Middle and Low
chronologies. As a result, subsequent discussion concentrated on the choice
of the most probable chronology among these. Van der Waerden (1974),
particularly, found the Short or Low the highest probable, while Huber
(1987) advocated the High. However, as mentioned above, the elimination
of the chronological anchors of the 56/64 year cycle liberated the search
from those bounds. We can also now see further evidence for the absence
of the former alleged bounds, due to the intrinsic inaccuracy introduced
by refraction. The signature of refraction variations have to survive in the
original core of the Venus Tablet, precisely because - in contrast to, say,
weather conditions - it will have a more regular character. Moreover, one
can consider it as a criterion for revealing the genuine part of the Tablet,
i.e. by means of the consideration of refraction corrections on the dates of
Venus visibilities given in the Tablet. Dates which fail to satisfy such regular
distortions must be identiﬁed either as (a) not reﬂecting actual observations
or (b) later addendums. More detailed studies of refraction in Babylonian
conditions, along with the deeper analysis of the noise in the Venus Tablet,
will be required for that purpose.

3 Solar eclipses

Let us also brieﬂy discuss recent attempts to link the reference to a solar
eclipse related to the birth of Shamshi-Adad to the various chronological
schemes. Michel and Rocher (1997-2000) proposed the eclipse of November
19, 1795 BC. Michel (2002) subsequently proposed the eclipse of June 24,
1833 BC. Warburton (2002) has mentioned the eclipses of April 2, 1847 BC
and October 8, 1764 BC.

We will particularly outline the ambiguities arising at such attempts
for particular eclipses. Among the eclipses discussed, the solar eclipse of
October 8, 1764 BC would have been observed at Mari, as well as in Babylon
and in Assur with a close magnitude and a shift in time of only a few minutes,
as an annular, non-central eclipse. The peculiarity of this historical eclipse
is that the location of the shadow at its maximal phases makes the fact
of the appearance of the eclipse in Mari independent of the time diﬀerence
Delta T= ET-UT, i.e. on the principal uncertainty aﬀecting most ancient
eclipses due to the unknown rate of the variation of the Earth’s rotation
period determined by tidal and non-tidal eﬀects. For that eclipse only the
magnitude of the maximal phase depends on that uncertainty, but not in

4

a crucial way. The solar eclipse of April 2, 1847 BC also, would have been
observed both in Mari and Assur, however its appearance, i.e. the magnitude
and the duration, is aﬀected more by the uncertainty in Delta T. The total
eclipse of June 24, 1833 BC might have been observed in Assur, but only with
a magnitude of about 0.4, quite low to be recorded as a presumably major
historical event. The latter estimation corresponds to ET-UT=49010.8 sec,
and at present there is no way for more precise theoretical estimations.
Similarly, the total eclipse of November 19, 1795 BC would have observed
as a partial eclipse with relatively higher maximum magnitude in Assur than
in Mari (though both lower than those of the eclipse of October 8, 1764 BC),
however the absolute values of the magnitudes again remain inaccurate.

4 Conclusion

The record of a single solar eclipse of Old Babylonian date, without de-
scription of details and/or unambiguous historical links, can hardly act as a
reliable anchor. The relevance depends upon the ability to link the eclipse
to another anchored astronomical event or to another similarly anchored
chronological framework. Given the dates for the life and death of Shamshi-
Adad and the various proposed chronologies, one could argue that the eclipse
of 1847 BC is compatible with the Middle Chronology, or that of 1795 BC
with the Low Chronology, or that of 1764 BC with the Ultra-Low Chronol-
ogy. That of 1833 BC is not compatible with any other existing chrono-
logical framework. However, all of these potentially relevant eclipses suﬀer
from the diﬃculty of trying to base chronologies on a single eclipse without
additional information. The selection of a date cannot alone resolve the
chronological debate unless the astronomical data are linked to the ancient
sources. Refraction acts as an additional uncertainty, hitherto neglected in
the interpretation of the Venus Tablet, in the ﬁtting the data not only to
ﬁxed lunar calendar, but also to the moving lunar calendar. The only robust
signal which can be extracted from the Venus Tablet, therefore, remains the
8-year cycle as argued in (Gasche et al. 1998; Gurzadyan 2000).

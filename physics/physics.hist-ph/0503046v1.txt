Uniﬁed Field Theory of Gravitation and Electricity

Albert Einstein
translation by A. Unzicker and T. Case

Session Report of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, pp. 414-419
July 25th, 1925

Among the theoretical physicists working in the ﬁeld of the general theory of relativity there should be
a consensus about the consubstantiality of the gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁeld. However, I was
not able to succeed in ﬁnding a convincing formulation of this connection so far. Even in my article
published in these session reports (XVII, p. 137, 1923) which is entirely based on the foundations
of Eddington, I was of the opinion that it does not reﬂect the true solution of this problem. After
searching ceaselessly in the past two years I think I have now found the true solution. I am going to
communicate it in the following.
The applied method can be characterized as follows. First, I looked for the formally most simple ex-
pression for the law of gravitation in the absence of an electromagnetic ﬁeld, and then the most natural
generalization of this law. This theory appeared to contain Maxwell’s theory in ﬁrst approximation.
1) and then show in which sense
In the following I shall outline the scheme of the general theory (
§
3).
this contains the law of the pure gravitational ﬁeld (

that the vector φτ occurs besides the tensor (gµν ) and the quantities Γα
µν. To obtain consistency with
the known laws of gravitation end electricity, we have to interpret the symmetric part of gµν as metric
tensor and the skew-symmetric part as electromagnetic ﬁeld, and we have to assume the vanishing of
φτ , which will be done in the following. For a later analysis (e.g. the problem of the electron), we will
have to keep in mind that the Hamiltonian principle does not indicate a vanishing φτ . Setting φτ to
zero leads to an overdetermination of the ﬁeld, since we have 16 + 64 + 4 algebraically independent
diﬀerential equations for 16 + 64 variables.

2. The pure gravitational ﬁeld as special case

§
Let the gµν be symmetric. The equations (7) are fulﬁlled identically. By changing µ to ν in (10a) and
subtraction we obtain in easily understandable notation

If ∆ is called the skew-symmetric part of Γ with respect to the last two indices, (11) takes the form

Γν,µα + Γµ,αν

Γµ,να

Γν,αµ = 0.

−

−

(11)

∆ν,µα + ∆µ,αν = 0

or

∆ν,µα = ∆µ,να.

(11a)

This symmetry property of the ﬁrst two indices contradicts the antisymmetry of the last ones, as we
learn from the series of equations

∆µ,να =

∆µ,αν =

∆α,µν = ∆α,νµ = ∆ν,αµ =

∆ν,µα.

−

−

−

This, in conjunction with (11a), compels the vanishing of all ∆. Therefore, the Γ are symmetric in
the last two indices as in Riemannian geometry. The equations (10a) can be resolved in a well-known
manner, and one obtains

∂xβ (cid:17)

Equation (12), together with (4) is the well-known law of gravitation. Had we presumed the symmetry
of the gµν at the beginning, we would have arrived at (12) and (4) directly. This seems to be the
most simple and coherent derivation of the gravitational equations for the vacuum to me. Therefore it
should be seen as a natural attempt to encompass the law of electromagnetism by generalizing these
considerations rightly. Had we not assumed the vanishing of the φτ , we would have been unable to
derive the known law of the gravitational ﬁeld in the above manner by assuming the symmetry of
the gµν . Had we assumed the symmetry of both the gµν and the Γα
µν instead, the vanishing of φα
would have been a consequence of (9) or (10a) and (7); we would have obtained the law of the pure
gravitational ﬁeld as well.

3. Relations to Maxwell’s theory

§
If there is an electromagnetic ﬁeld, that means the gµν or the gµν do contain a skew-symmetric part,
we cannot solve the eqns. (10a) any more with respect to the Γα
µν, which signiﬁcantly complicates the
clearness of the whole system. We succeed in resolving the problem however, if we restrict ourselves
to the ﬁrst approximation. We shall do this and once again postulate the vanishing of φτ . Thus we
start with the ansatz

(12)

(13)

gµν =

δµν + γµν + φµν ,

−

3

whereby the γµν should be symmetric, and the φµν skew-symmetric, both should be inﬁnitely small
in ﬁrst order. We neglect quantities of second and higher orders. Then the Γα
µν are inﬁnitely small in
ﬁrst order as well.
Under these circumstances the system (10a) takes the more simple form

+

∂gµν
∂xα

+ Γν

µα + Γµ

αν = 0.

(10b)

After applying two cyclic permutations of the indices µ, ν and α two further equations appear. Then,
out of the three equations we may calculate the Γ in a similar manner as in the symmetric case. One
obtains

Γα

µν =

∂gαν
∂xµ

∂gµα

∂gνµ

Eqn. (4) is reduced to the ﬁrst and third term. If we put the expression Γα
obtains

Before further consideration of (15), we develop the series from equation (7). Firstly, out of (13) follows
that the approximation we are interested in yields

Regarding this, (7) transforms to

gµν =

δµν

−

−

γµν + φµν ,

Now we put the expressions given by (13) into (15) and obtain with respect to (17)

∂2φµν

= 0.

The expressions (18), which may be simpliﬁed as usual by proper choice of coordinates, are the same
as in the absence of an electromagnetic ﬁeld. In the same manner, the equations (17) and (19) for
the electromagnetic ﬁeld do not contain the quantities γµν which refer to the gravitational ﬁeld. Thus
both ﬁelds are - in accordance with experience - independent in ﬁrst approximation.
The equations (17), (19) are nearly equivalent to Maxwell’s equations of empty space. (17) is one
Maxwellian system. The expressions

which2 according to Maxwell should vanish, do not vanish necessarily due to (17) and (19), but
their divergences of the form

however do. Thus (17) and (19) are substantially identical to Maxwell’s equations of empty space.
Concerning the attribution of φµν to the electric and magnetic vectors (a and h) I would like to make
a comment that claims validity independently from the theory presented here. According to classical
mechanics that uses central forces to every sequence of motion V there is an inverse motion ¯V , that

passes the same conﬁgurations by taking an inverse succession. This inverse motion ¯V is formally
obtained from V by substituting

−

in the latter one.
We observe a similar behavior, according to the general theory of relativity, in the case of a pure
gravitational ﬁeld. To achieve the solution ¯V out of V , one has to substitute t′ =
t into all ﬁeld
functions and to change the sign of the ﬁeld components g14, g24, g34 and the energy components T14,
T24, T34. This is basically the same procedure as applying the above transformation to the primary
motion V . The change of signs in g14, g24, g34 and in T14, T24, T34 is an intrinsic consequence of the
transformation law for tensors.
This generation of the inverse motion by transformation of the time coordinate (t′ =
t) should
be regarded as a general law that claims validity for electromagnetic processes as well. There, an
inversion of the process changes the sign of the magnetic components, but not those of the electric
ones. Therefore one should have to assign the components φ23, φ31, φ12 to the electric ﬁeld and φ14,
φ24, φ34 to the magnetic ﬁeld. We have to give up the inverse assignment which was in use as yet. It
was preferred so far, since it seems more comfortable to express the density of a current by a vector
rather than by a skew-symmetric tensor of third rank.
Thus in the theory outlined here, (7) respectively (17) is the expression for the law of magnetoelectric
induction. In accordance, at the r.h.s. of the equation there is no term that could be interpreted as
density of the electric current.
The next issue is, if the theory developed here renders the existence of singularity-free, centrally sym-
metric electric masses comprehensible. I started to tackle this problem together with Mr. J. Grommer,
who was at my disposal ceaselessly for all calculations while analyzing the general theory of relativity
in the last years. At this point I would like to express my best thanks to him and to the ‘International
educational board’ which has rendered possible the continuing collaboration with Mr. Grommer.

Riemannian Geometry with Maintaining the Notion
of Distant Parallelism

Albert Einstein
translation by A. Unzicker and T. Case

Session Report of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, pp. 217-221
June 7th, 1928

Riemannian Geometry has led to a physical description of the gravitational ﬁeld in the theory of
general relativity, but it did not provide concepts that can be attributed to the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Therefore, theoreticians aim to ﬁnd natural generalizations or extensions of riemannian geometry
that are richer in concepts, hoping to arrive at a logical construction that uniﬁes all physical ﬁeld
concepts under one single leading point. Such endeavors brought me to a theory which should be
communicated even without attempting any physical interpretation, because it can claim a certain
interest just because of the naturality of the concepts introduced therein.
Riemannian geometry is characterized by an Euclidean metric in an inﬁnitesimal neighborhood of any
point P . Furthermore, the absolute values of the line elements which belong to the neighborhood of
two points P and Q of ﬁnite distance can be compared. However, the notion of parallelism of such line
elements is missing; a concept of direction does not exist for the ﬁnite case. The theory outlined in the
following is characterized by introducing - beyond the Riemannian metric- the concept of ‘direction’,
‘equality of directions’ or ‘parallelism’ for ﬁnite distances. Therefore, new invariants and tensors will
arise besides those known in Riemannian geometry.

1. n-bein ﬁeld and metric

§
Given an arbitrary point P of the n-dimensional continuum, let’s imagine an orthogonal n-bein of
n unit vectors that represents a local coordinate system. Aa are the components of a line element
or another vector with respect to this local system (n-bein). Besides that, we introduce a Gaussian
coordinate system of the xν for describing a ﬁnite domain. Let Aν be the components of a vector (A)
with respect to the latter, and hν
a the ν-components of the unit vectors forming the n-bein. Then, we
have3

One obtains the inversion of (1) by calling hν

νa the normalized subdeterminants of the hν

a,

Aν = hν

aAa. . . .

Aa = hµaAµ . . . .

(1a)

Since the inﬁnitesimal sets are Euclidean,

X
holds for the modulus A of the vector (A).

A2 =

A2

a = hµa hνaAµAν . . .

3We assign Greek letters to the coordinate indices and Latin ones to the bein indices.

(1)

(2)

Therefore, the components of the metric tensor appear in the form

whereby the sum has to be taken over a. For a ﬁxed a, the hµ
vector. Furthermore, the following relations hold:

a are the components of a contravariant

gµν = hµa hνa, . . .

hµa hν
hµa hµ

a = δν
µ . . .
b = δab, . . .

(3)

(4)

(5)

with δ = 1 if the indices are equal, and δ = 0, if not. The correctness of (4) and (5) follows from the
above deﬁnition of the hµa as the normalized subdeterminants of the hµ
a . The vector property of hµa
follows conveniently from the fact that the l.h.s. and therefore, the r.h.s. of (1a) as well, are invariant
for any coordinate transformation and for any choice of the vector (A). The n-bein ﬁeld is determined
by n2 functions hµ
quantities. According
to (3), the metric is determined by the n-bein ﬁeld but not vice versa.

a , whereas the Riemannian metric is determined just by n(n+1)

2

2. Teleparallelism and rotation invariance

§
By postulating the existence of the n-bein ﬁeld (in every point) one expresses implicitly the existence
of a Riemannian metric and distant parallelism. (A) and (B) being two vectors in the points P and Q
which have the same local coordinates with respect to their n-beins (that means Aa = Ba), then have
to be regarded as equal (because of (2)) and as ’parallel’.
If we take the metric and the teleparallelism as the essential, i.e. the objective meaningful things,
then we realize that the n-bein ﬁeld is not yet fully determined by these settings. Yet metric and
teleparallelism remain intact, if we substitute the n-beins of all points of the continuum with such
n-beins that were derived out of the original ones by the rotation stated above. We denote this
substitutability of the n-bein ﬁeld as rotational invariance and establish: Only those mathematical
relations that are rotational invariant can claim a real meaning.
Thus by keeping the coordinate system ﬁxed, and a given metric and parallel connection, the hµ
a are
not yet fully determined; there is a possible substitution which corresponds to the rotation invariance

A∗

a = da mAm...,

(6)

whereby da m is chosen orthogonal and independent of the coordinates. (Aa) is an arbitrary vector with
respect to the local system, (A∗
a) the same vector with respect to the rotated local system. According
to (1a), and using (6), it follows

or

whereby

h ∗
µaAµ = damhµmAµ

h∗
µa = damhµm, . . .

(6a)

dam dbm = dma dmb = δab, . . .

(6b)

∂dam
∂xν = 0. . . .

(6c)

Now the postulate of rotation invariance tells us that among the relations in which the quantities h
appear, only those may be seen as meaningful, which are transformed into h∗ of equal form, if h∗ is
introduced by eqns. (6). In other words: n-bein ﬁelds which are related by locally equal rotations are
equivalent.

2

The rule of inﬁnitesimal parallel transport of a vector from point (xν ) to a neighboring point (xν +dxν )
is obviously characterized by

d Aa = 0 . . . ,

(7)

that means by the equation

0 = d(hµaAµ) =

∂hµa
∂xσ Aµdxσ + hµadAµ = 0

Mulitplicated by hν

This law of parallel transport is rotation invariant and not symmetric with respect to the lower indices
of the quantities ∆ν
µσ. If one transports the vector (A) now according to this law along a closed path,
the vector remains unaltered; this means, that the Riemannian tensor

Ri

built from the connection coeﬃcients vanishes according to (7a), which can be veriﬁed easily. Be-
sides this law of parallel transport there is that (nonintegrable) symmetric transport law due to the

obviously rotation invariant in the above sense.

3. Invariants and covariants

§
On the manifold we are considering, besides the tensors and invariants of Riemann-geometry which
contain the quantities h only in the combination (3), other tensors and invariants exist, among which
we will have a look at the simplest ones only.
If one starts with a vector (Aν) in the point xν, with the shifts d and ¯d, the two vectors

New Possibility for a Uniﬁed Field Theory
of Gravitation and Electricity

Albert Einstein
translation by A. Unzicker and T. Case

Session Report of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, pp. 224-227
June 14th, 1928

Some days ago I explained in a short note in these reports, how by using a n-bein ﬁeld a geometric
theory can be constructed that is based on the notion of a Riemann-metric and distant parallelism. I
left open the question if this theory could serve for describing physical phenomena. In the meantime I
discovered that this theory - at least in ﬁrst approximation – yields the ﬁeld equations of gravitation
and electromagnetism in a very simple and natural manner. Thus it seems possible that this theory
will substitute the theory of general relativity in its original form.
The introduction of this theory has as a consequence the existence of a straight line, that means a
line of which all elements are parallel to each other.6 Naturally, such a line is not identical with a
geodesic. Furthermore, contrarily to the actual theory of relativity, the notion of relative rest of two
mass points exists (parallelism of two line elements that belong to two diﬀerent world lines).
In order to apply the general theory in the implemented form to the ﬁeld theory, one has to set the
following conventions:

1. The dimension is 4 (n = 4).
2. The fourth local component Aa (a=4) of a vector is purely imaginary, and so are the
components of the 4th bein of the 4-bein,7 and also the quantities hν
8. Of course,
all the coeﬃcients of γµν (= hµahνa) become then real. Thus, we choose the square of the
modulus of a timelike vector to be negative.

2. The ﬁeld law in ﬁrst approximation

§
If the manifold is the Minkowski-world of the theory of special relativity, one may choose the coordi-
nate system in a way that h11 = h22 = h33 = 1, h44 = j (= √
1) holds and the other hµα vanish. This
system of values for hµα is a little inconvenient for calculations. Therefore in this paragraph for cal-
culations we prefer to assume the x4-coordinate to be purely imaginary; then, the Minkowski-world
(absence of any ﬁeld for a suitable choice of coordinates) can be described by

−

The case of inﬁnitely weak ﬁelds can be described purposively by

hµα = δµα . . .

hµα = δµα + kµα, . . .

whereby the kµα are small values of ﬁrst order. While neglecting quantities of third and higher order
one has to replace (1a) with respect to (10) and (7a) loc. it. by

This are 16 equations11 for the 16 quantities kαβ. Our task is now to see if this system of equations
contains the known laws of gravitational and the electromagnetical ﬁeld. For this purpose we introduce
in (5) the gαβ and the φα instead of the kαβ. We have to deﬁne

gαβ = hαahβa = (δαa + kαa)(δβa + kβa)

vanishes identically.

The case of the absence of an electromagnetic ﬁeld is characterized by the vanishing of φµ. In this case
(7) is in ﬁrst order equivalent to the equation

used as yet in the theory of general relativity (Rαβ = contracted Riemann tensor). With the help of
this it is proved that our new theory yields the law of a pure gravitational ﬁeld in ﬁrst approximation
correctly.
By diﬀerentiation of (2a) by xα, one gets the equation

according to (5) and contraction over α and β. Taking into account that the l.h.s. Lαβ of (7) fulﬁlls

The equations (8) and (9) are, as it is well known, equivalent to Maxwell’s equations for empty
space. The new theory thus also yields Maxwell’s equations in ﬁrst approximation.
According to this theory, the separation of the gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁeld seems arbitrary
however. Furthermore, it is clear that the eqns. (5) state more than the eqns. (7), (8) and (9) together.
After all it is remarkable that the electric ﬁeld does not enter the ﬁeld equations quadratically.

Uniﬁed Field Theory Based on Riemannian Metrics and
Distant Parallelism

Albert Einstein
translation by A. Unzicker and T. Case

Math. Annal. 102 (1930), pp. 685-697

In the present work I would like to describe a theory I have been working on for a year; it will be
exposed in a manner that it can be understood comfortably by everyone who is familiar with the theory
of general relativity. The following exposure is necessary, because due to coherences and improvements
found in the meantime reading the earlier work would be a useless loss of time. The topic is presented
in a way that seems most serviceable for comfortable access. I learned, especially with the help of Mr.
Weitzenb¨ock and Mr. Cartan, that the dealing with the continua we are talking about is not new.
Mr. Cartan kindly wrote an essay about the history of the relevant mathematical topic in order to
complete my paper; it is printed right after this paper in the same review. I would also like to thank
Mr. Cartan heartily at this point for his valuable contribution. The most important and undisputable
new result of the present work is the ﬁnding of the most simple ﬁeld laws that can be applied to
a Riemannian manifold with distant parallelism. I am only going to discuss their physical meaning
brieﬂy.

1. The structure of the continuum

§
Since the number of dimensions has no impact on the following considerations, we suppose a n-
dimensional continuum. To take into account the facts of metrics and gravitation we assume the
existence of a Riemann-metric. In nature there also exist electromagnetic ﬁelds, which cannot be
described by Riemannian metrics. This arouses the question: How can we complement our Riemannian
spaces in a natural, logical way with an additional structure, so that the whole thing has a uniform
character ?
The continuum is (pseudo-)Euclidean in the vicinity of every point P . In every point there exists
a local coordinate system of geodesics (i.e. an orthogonal n-bein), in relation to which the theorem
of Pythagoras is valid. The orientation of these n-beins is not important in a Riemannian manifold.
We would now like to assume that these elementary Euclidean spaces are governed by still another
direction law. We are also going to assume, that it makes sense to speak of a parallel orientation
of all n-beins together, applying this to space structure like in Euclidean geometry (which would be
senseless in a space with metrical structure only).
In the following we are going to think of the orthogonal n-beins as being always in parallel orientation.
The in its self arbitrary orientation of the local n-bein in one point P then determines the orientation
of the local n-beins in all points of the continuum uniquely. Our task now is to set up the most simple
restrictive laws which can be applied to such a continuum. Doing so, we hope to derive the general
laws of nature, as the previous theory of general relativity tried this for gravitation by applying a
purely metrical space structure.

2. Mathematical description of the space structure

§
The local n-bein consists of n orthogonal unit vectors with components h ν
s with respect to any
Gaussian coordinate system. Here as always a lower Latin index indicates the aﬃliation to a certain
bein of the n-beins, a Greek index - due to its upper or lower position - the covariant or contravariant
transformation character of the relevant entity with respect to a change of the Gaussian coordinate
system. The general transformation property of the h ν
is the following. If all local systems or n-beins
s
are twisted in the same manner, which is a correct operation of course, and a new Gaussian coordinate
system is introduced at the same time, the following transformation law then exists in-between the
new and old h ν
s

whereas the constant coeﬃcients αst form an orthogonal system:

(cid:26)

Without problems the transformation law (1) can be generalized onto objects which components bear
an arbitrary number of local indices and coordinate indices. We call such objects tensors. Out of this
the algebraic laws of tensors (addition, multiplication, contraction by Latin and Greek indices) follow
immediately.
We call h ν
s the components of the fundamental tensor. If a vector in the local system has components
As, and the coordinates Aν with respect to the Gaussian system, it follows out of the meaning of the
h ν

hsµh µ

t = δst

Due to the orthogonality of the local system we obtain the absolute value of the vector

A2 = A2

s = hsµ hsν Aµ Aν = gµν Aµ Aν;

Therefore,

gµν = hsµ hsν

are the coeﬃcients of the metric.
The fundamental tensor allows (cfr. (3) and (4)) to transform local indices into coordinate indices and
vice versa (by multiplication and contraction), so that it comes down to pure convention, with which
type of tensors one likes to operate.
Obviously the following relations hold:

Therefore, the invariant of the volume element √gdτ takes the form hdτ . To take into account the
particular properties of time, it is most comfortable to set the x4-coordinate (both local and general)
of our 4-dimensional space-time continuum purely imaginary and also all tensor components with an
odd number of indices 4.

3. Diﬀerential relations

§
Now we denote δ the change of the components of a vector or tensor during a ’parallel displacement’
in the sense of Levi-Civita during the transition to a inﬁnitely neighboring point of the continuum;
now it follows out of the above

Resolving the brackets yields

0 = δAs = δ(hsαAα) = δ(h α

s Aα)

whereas the colon indicates ordinary diﬀerentiation by xβ. Resolving of the equation yields

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

(The last conversion is based on(5)).
This law of parallel displacement is – contrarily to Riemannian geometry – in general not symmetric.
If it is, we have Euclidean geometry, because

We call this covariant derivative (Aτ ;α) of Aτ ).
Therefore, we obtain the law of covariant diﬀerentiation

Analogously, out of (3) follows the formula

example:

By means of the fundamental tensor h α
s we are allowed to transform local (Latin) indices in coordinate
(Greek) indices, so we are free to favor the local or coordinate indices when formulating some tensor
relations. The ﬁrst approach is preferred by the Italian colleagues (Levi-Civita, Palatini), while I have
preferably used coordinate indices.
Divergence. By contraction of the covariant diﬀerential quotient one obtains the divergence as in
the absolute diﬀerential calculus based on metrics only. E.g., one gets the tensor

out of (21) by contraction of the indices σ and ρ.
In earlier papers I even introduced other divergence operators, but I do not accredit special signiﬁcance
to those any more.
Covariant diﬀerential quotients of the fundamental tensor.
One can easily ﬁnd out of the formulas derived above, that the covariant derivatives and divergences

Diﬀerentiation of tensor products. As it is apparent in the well-known diﬀerential calculus the

In order to be expressed by the entities h ,the ∆’s must comply to these conditions (cfr.(12)). Looking
at (20), it is clear that the characteristic laws of the manifold in consideration here must be very
diﬀerent from the earlier theory. Though according to the new theory all tensors of the earlier theory
exist, in particular the Riemannian curvature tensor calculated from the Christoﬀel symbols. But
according to the new theory there are simpler and more elementary tensorial objects, that can be used
for formulating the ﬁeld laws.

According to this theory there is a tensor containing the components hσα of the fundamental tensor

the validity of Euclidean geometry (cfr. (13)). Therefore, a natural law for such a continuum will

Proof. If T is a scalar (tensor without Greek index), we obtain the proof without eﬀort using (15).
In this special case we will ﬁnd the proof of the general theorem.
The ﬁrst remark we would like to make is, that according to the theory discussed here parallel vector
ﬁelds do exist. These vector ﬁelds have the same components in all local systems. If (aa) or (aa) is
such a vector ﬁeld, it satisﬁes the condition

Using such parallel vector ﬁelds the changing rule easily leads back to the rule for a scalar. For the
sake of simplicity, we perform the proof for a tensor T λ with only one index. If φ is a scalar, the ﬁrst
thing that follows out of the deﬁnitions (16) and (21) is

If we put the scalar aλT λ into this equation for φ, aλ being a parallel vector ﬁeld, aλ may be inter-
changed with the diﬀerentiation symbol at every covariant diﬀerentiation, therefore aλ appears as a
factor in all the terms. Therefore, one obtains

This identity must hold for any choice of aλ in a certain position, therefore the bracket vanishes, and

Identities for the tensor Λ. Permuting the indices κ, λ, µ in (20), adding the three identities, and
by appropriate summing-up of the terms with respect to (21) one obtains

4. The ﬁeld equations

§
The most simple ﬁeld equations we desired to ﬁnd will be conditions for the tensor Λ α
λ ν . The number of
h-components is n2, of which n remain indeterminate due to general covariance; therefore the number
of independent ﬁeld equations must be n2
n. On the other hand, the higher number of possibilities
a theory cuts down on (without contradicting experience), the more satisfactory it is. Therefore, the
number Z of ﬁeld equations should be as large as possible. If ¯Z denotes the number of identities
in-between the ﬁeld equations, Z

As we see the number of identities just ﬁts. We do not stop here, but prove the following
Proposition. If in a cross section xn = const. all diﬀerential equations are satisﬁed and, in addition,
(n2 + 1)
n of them are properly chosen everywhere, then all n2 + n equations are fulﬁlled anywhere.
Proof .If all equations are fulﬁlled in the cross section xn = a and if these equations, that correspond
to setting to zero the below, are fulﬁlled everywhere, we obtain:

−

Then from (4) follows, that the F µα vanish everywhere. Now one deduces from (36), that in an
neighboring cross section xn = a + da the skew-symmetric Gµα for α = n must vanish as well 20. Out
of (26a) it then follows, that in addition the symmetric Gµα for α = n at the adjacent cross section
xn = a + da must vanish. Repeating this kind of deduction proves the proposition.

5. First approximation

§
We are now going to deal with a ﬁeld that shows very little diﬀerence from an Euclidean one with
ordinary parallelism. Then we may set

hsν = δsν + ¯hsν,
(37)
where ¯hsν is inﬁnitely small at ﬁrst order, higher order terms are neglected. Then, according to (5)
and (6), we have to set

In ﬁrst approximation, the ﬁeld equations (29), (31) read

we substitute equation (31) by

Therefore,

We claim now that there is an inﬁnitesimal coordinate transformation xν′
the variables ¯hαν,ν und ¯hαν,α to vanish.
Proof. First we prove that

If we now separate ¯hαν,ν according to the equations

where δαµ + ¯gαµ(= gµν ) determines metrics in ﬁrst approximation , thus the ﬁeld equations take the

One is led to suppose, that ¯gαν and aαµ represent the gravitational and the electromagnetic ﬁeld in
ﬁrst approximation respectively. (44), (45) correspond to Poisson’s equation, (46), (47) to Maxwell’s
equations of the empty space. It is interesting that the ﬁeld laws of gravitation seem to be separated
from those of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, a fact which is in agreement with the observed independence
of the two ﬁelds. But in a strict sense none of them exists separately.
Regarding the covariance of the equations (44) to (47) we note the following. For the hsµ’s generally
the transformation law

holds. If the coordinate transformation is chosen linear and orthogonal as well as conform with respect
to the twist of the local systems, that is

we acquire the transformation law

which is exactly the same as for tensors in special relativity. Because of (48) the same transformation
law holds for the δsµ, so it also holds for the ¯hαµ, ¯gαµ, and aαµ. With respect to such transformations
the equations (44) to (47) are covariant.

6. Outlook

§
The big appeal of the theory exposed here, lies in its unifying structure and the high-level (but
allowed) overdetermination of the ﬁeld variables. I was able to show that the ﬁeld equations yield
equations, in ﬁrst-order approximation, that correspond to the Newton-Poisson theory of gravitation
and to Maxwell’s theory of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Nevertheless I’m still far away from claiming the
physical validity of the equations I derived. The reason for that is, that I did not succeed in deriving
equations of motion for particles yet.

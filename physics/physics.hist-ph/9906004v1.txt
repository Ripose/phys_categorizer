Mechanics. - On the analytic expression that must be given to
the gravitational tensor in Einstein’s theory

†

Note by the Fellow

T. Levi-Civita

translation and foreword by
S. Antoci∗ and A. Loinger∗∗

Foreword. While most textbooks of general relativity and research articles discuss at length the relative merits
of the pseudo tensors proposed by Einstein and by other authors for representing the energy of the gravitational ﬁeld,
Levi Civita’s deﬁnition of a true gravitational energy tensor has succumbed to Einstein’s authority and is nearly
forgotten. It seems however worthy of a careful re-examination, due to its unquestionable logical soundness and to

the unique manner of propagation for gravitational energy that it entails.

In the present Note, after having recalled, for the reader’s convenience, the leading idea and
the mathematical framework of general relativity, I show how some identities (involving the deriva-
tives of the Riemann symbols) discovered by Bianchi oﬀer a sure criterion for introducing the so
called gravitational tensor. From the analytic standpoint one has to do with a double symmetric
system Aik (i, k = 0, 1, 2, 3), whose ten elements completely deﬁne the gravitational contribution
to the local mechanical behaviour. In fact they determine the stresses as well as the energy ﬂow
and the energy density (of gravitational origin). The mechanical meaning of the system requires
an analytic structure endowed with convenient invariance properties with respect to co-ordinate
transformations. Such is actually the (covariant) form of the Aik yielded by the above mentioned
criterion. Furthermore this form provides a very expressive extension of d’Alembert’s principle.

The idea of a gravitational tensor belongs to the great construction by Einstein. However its
deﬁnition as given by the Author cannot be considered ﬁnal. First of all, from the mathematical
standpoint, it lacks the invariant character that it should instead necessarily enjoy according to
the spirit of general relativity. Even worse is the fact, perceived with keen intuition by Einstein
himself (1), that from such a deﬁnition it follows a clearly unacceptable consequence about the
gravitational waves. For this point he however ﬁnds a way out in quantum theory.

The solution is however less remote: everything depends on the incorrect form assumed for
the gravitational tensor. We shall see that with our determination any possibility for paradox
automatically disappears.

1. Generalities.

- In ordinary mechanics the physical space is taken to be strictly Eu-
clidean, and the analytical representation of phenomena is, let us say, subordinated to the (ternary)
quadratic diﬀerential form dl2 that expresses the square of the line element.

In the restricted theory of relativity one persists in considering space as Euclidean; however
the equations of mechanics are no longer invariant with respect to the form dl2; they are invariant

with respect to a quaternary form ds2 that implies also the time t. Notoriously it has the expression

(c universal constant to be interpreted as velocity of light in vacuo).

It is clear that, with reference to Cartesian co-ordinates, one has again

In general relativity - new and more comprehensive conception of the natural laws, again due to
Einstein - space and time do not provide a plain localisation, inert and immutable, of phenomena.
They are instead aﬀected by the latter and they react in such a way as to change the nature of ds2.

Instead of (1), one has the fundamental form

ds2 = c2dt2

−

dl2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2.

ds2 =

ik gikdxidxk,

X

which, with appropriate choice of the parameters x0, x1, x2, x3, reduces itself exactly to the form
(1) in the limit case, when any physically perceptible action (either presence or motion of matter,
of electricity, more generally of some form of energy) is lacking. As a rule, although quantitatively
very close to the type (1), (2) must be considered as not given a priori, but intrinsically deﬁn-
able according to the factual circumstances. Among these it obviously appears also the universal
gravitation, which, according to Einstein, deserves the privilege of depending exclusively on the
coeﬃcients gik (and on their derivatives).

The equations of the new mechanics as a whole are invariant with respect to that well deter-
mined form (2) that pertains to the speciﬁc case. In this new mechanics the theory for a given
class of phenomena necessarily entails, together with relations that have their counterpart in the
previous formulations (classical and relativistic of the ﬁrst manner), further relations whose scope
is the determination of ds2. These are Einstein’s gravitational equations (in number of 10 like the
coeﬃcients gik), that we shall consider explicitly in

§
2. Energy tensor. - The mechanics of continuous systems - also according to the ordinary
scheme - leads to conclude that a mechanical phenomenon (occurring in a given range of values for
x, y, z, t) is well known when the following elements: stresses, momentum, energy ﬂow and energy
density, are assigned (as functions of position and of time).

6.

In relativistic mechanics the vector q, that represents the momentum density, is linked to the

energy ﬂow χ by the relation

It is convenient to avail of the single vector

(1)

(2)

(3)

that can be considered as the energy ﬂow occurring in a light-second (time interval during which
light travels the length unit). Let us notice, to avoid any misunderstanding, that we do not mean
to ﬁx in this way the time unit: it remains generic, like the other two fundamental units.

Let us write for short

q =

1
c2 χ.

f = cq =

χ,

−

1
c

2

(4)

y0 = ct, y1 = x, y2 = y, y3 = z.

With reference to these variables, let us introduce a symmetric tensor Tik deﬁned in this way: for
i, k = 1, 2, 3, Tik is the component along the yk axis of the speciﬁc stress exerted on a surface
element normal to the yi axis (2) (or vice versa, by exchanging i and k); Ti0 = T0i is identiﬁed with
the component fi of the vector f ; T00 is ﬁnally the energy density.

3. Reference to arbitrary co-ordinates. - If four arbitrary (independent) combinations

x0, x1, x2, x3 are substituted for the yi, the form

(1′)

(5)

takes the general expression (2). However the qualitative restrictions

ds2 = c2dy2

(dy2

0 −

g00 > 0, gii < 0

(i = 1, 2, 3),

shall hold whenever the parameter x0 (individually varied) is apt to reﬂect the intuitive notion of
time, while the remaining xi can in some way be interpreted as actual space co-ordinates.

When this holds, we shall interpret as energy tensor in arbitrary co-ordinates xi that double

covariant system Tik which, when referred to the y, is speciﬁed in the way shown above.

From the very covariance formulae that deﬁne the elements of the system Tik one derives, for

each of them, an interpretation in general co-ordinates x. And precisely one ﬁnds (3) that:

represents the (orthogonal) component along the line xi (the one along which only xi varies) of the
stress exerted on a surface element normal to the line xk (or vice versa, by exchanging i and k);

corresponding to

ds2 for dx0 = 0 is attributed].

4. Linear invariant and divergence of the energy tensor.

- We adhere to the
usual notation of the absolute diﬀerential calculus. Therefore we represent with g(ik) the elements
reciprocal to the coeﬃcients gik, and with Tikl (i, k, l = 0, 1, 2, 3) the system covariantly derived
, we shall
from Tik according to the fundamental form. At present, as already in the previous

§

(2) with the convention (usual in hydrodynamics) that a positive normal stress corresponds to pressure.
(3) Dwelling here on the way of deduction would be out of place. However I allow myself to notice that
there is no need of actual calculations: one can avail of an appropriate adjustment of the methods of the
absolute diﬀerential calculus to the indeﬁnite ds2 that encompass space and time.

one deﬁnes an invariant, that is just called linear invariant or scalar of the energy tensor.

One calls instead divergence of the same energy tensor the simple covariant system (or four-

dimensional vector)

(6)

The mechanical meaning of the divergence (like the meaning of T , which I neglect to notice,
because it is immediate) becomes clear when one goes back to the variables y. With respect to
such variables g(ik) = 0 (i
1 (i = 1, 2, 3), and the covariant diﬀerentiation
coincides with the ordinary one.

§

Let us remind of

2 and notice that, due to (3), the components Ti0 are identical with

cqi
(qi components of the momentum density q). Therefore it obviously appears from the ﬁrst three
equations written above (when ct is substituted for y0) that
Fi (i = 1, 2, 3) are components of
the external force F applied to the system (per unit volume). The last equation, when [always
1
c χk (χk components of the energy ﬂow χ), ﬁnally
according to (3)] the T0k are taken in the form
shows that cF0 is the power density, i.e. the energy given from outside to the system per time
and volume units. One can also say, if desired, that F0 represents the energy given to the system
per volume unit in a light-second. Hence it turns out in particular that for an isolated system the
divergence is vanishing.

5. Transition to general relativity. - Despite the reference to general co-ordinates, up
to now we have supposed to deal with a Euclidean ds2. Formally the situation happens to be the
same also with a ds2 essentially not reducible to the type (1’), if however:

a) x0 can be interpreted as time and the other three co-ordinates as space parameters since,

in keeping with this, the inequalities (5) hold true;

b) the usual mechanical intuitions are preserved (at an inﬁnitesimal scale), hence it is possible
to attribute a deﬁnite meaning to local measurements of force, stresses, energy ﬂow and energy
density. In such conditions the energy tensor is uniquely deﬁned through the ratios

We shall hereafter assume our ds2 to be a priori arbitrary (apart from the restrictions given

above); naturally one shall take this ds2 as fundamental form.

6. The equations of the gravitational field. - Let gij,hk (i, j, h, k = 0, 1, 2, 3) indicate
the Riemann symbols of the ﬁrst kind belonging to a generic quaternary ds2 like (2). Due to their
covariance, the positions

I remark in passing that the homogeneity of both sides of (10) can be checked if one imagines
referring to mutually homogeneous parameters x0, x1, x2, x3, e.g. lengths, like (for the Euclidean
ds2) the y deﬁned by the positions (4). The coeﬃcients gik are then pure numbers, and the left-
hand sides have clearly the dimensions l−2. On the other hand all the Tik (speciﬁc stresses apart
from numerical factors, etc.) have in this case the same dimensions, and precisely ml−1t−2. One
has further

−1t2,
hence also the right-hand sides have actually the dimensions l−2.

7. Formal validation derived from the Bianchi identities. - The covariant derivatives
of the Riemann symbols are linked by very remarkable relations due to Bianchi (6), that can be
resumed in the formula

gij,hkl + gjl,hki + gli,hkj = 0 (i, j, h, k, l = 0, 1, 2, 3),

or, due to well known properties of the Riemann symbols, in the equivalent formula

gij,hkl + gil,khj

glj,hki = 0.

−

Let us multiply by 1

2 g(kl)g(jh) and sum with respect to k, l, j, h; when the sum is accomplished,
let us exchange in the second term j with l and h with k. The second term thus becomes identical
with the ﬁrst, and one gets

kljh g(kl)g(jh)gij,hkl

kljh g(kl)g(jh)glj,hki = 0 (i = 0, 1, 2, 3).

On the other hand, the covariant diﬀerentiation of (8) - by reminding of Ricci’s lemma, according
to which the coeﬃcients of the fundamental form have vanishing covariant derivative - yields

They contain the validation of the gravitational equations (10) from the mathematical standpoint.
Here is why: the right-hand sides of (10) constitute a double system with vanishing divergence
(7). If one requires the system (10) to be complete [i.e. no condition is imposed on ds2 beyond
the exterior circumstances resumed in Tik], also the divergence of the ﬁrst-hand sides, hence of the
system

must identically vanish. This fact is just expressed by the equations (12).

ple. - If we set for short

the gravitational equations (10) read

(cid:27)

Tik + Aik = 0 (i, k = 0, 1, 2, 3).

In them we interpret Aik as components of an energy tensor due to the space-time environment,
i.e. exclusively dependent on the coeﬃcients of ds2. Such a tensor can be equally well named either
gravitational or inertial (8) because both gravitation and inertia depend on ds2. Therefore (10’)
give rise to the following proposition:

The nature of ds2 is always such as to balance all mechanical actions; in fact the sum of the

energy tensor and of the inertial one identically vanishes.

(7) In fact Tik include the contribution of all the phenomena that occur at the considered place and time
(apart from gravitation). One deals anyway with an isolated system in the ordinary sense of the word.
Therefore force and power must vanish within each of its elementary portions.
(8) See for instance W. De Sitter, On the relativity of rotation in Einstein’s theory, Proc. of K. Ak. van
Wet. te Amsterdam, vol. XIX, 1916, p. 530 (in footnote).

One is naturally led to associate this proposition with d’Alembert’s principle “the lost forces
(i.e. directly applied forces and inertial ones) balance each other”. The equilibrium expressed by
(10’) is just the most complete occurrence that can be conceived from the mechanical standpoint.
In fact, not only the total force applied to each single element comes to vanish, but also stresses,
energy ﬂow and energy density (by taking inertia into account through Aik) behave in this way.

It is clear that this total lack of mechanical entities pertains to isolated systems. Let us
introduce in the ﬁeld of such a system for instance a bit of matter (and for simplicity the ensuing
alteration of the ﬁeld is supposed negligible); several external actions coming from the system are
exerted on the extra matter. In the ideal case of the mass point, these can be summarised in a
law of motion (geodesic with respect to the four-dimensional ds2). It contains in particular the
ordinary dynamics of a point subjected to conservative forces.

It must be remarked that Einstein’s fundamental equations, connected here with d’Alembert’s
principle, have been already derived, by Einstein himself and, in a more complete way, by Lorentz
and by Hilbert (9), from the appropriate variation of a unique integral. In this way also Hamilton’s
principle is extended to the new mechanics.

9. Einstein’s misunderstanding about the gravitational tensor.

although it may be superﬂuous, that by setting

from any double covariant system Aik one immediately gets a mixed system A(j)
(covariant with
It follows that, in order
respect to the index i and contravariant with respect to the index j).
to identify the gravitational tensor with respect to certain variables, it makes no diﬀerence if one
ﬁxes either the elements Aik or their linear combinations A(j)
. With this proviso let us come to

and the invariant in question should reduce itself to G∗.

Now it is well known (11) that diﬀerential invariants of the 10 order which are intrinsic i.e.,
like G∗, exclusively formed with the coeﬃcients of ds2 and with their ﬁrst derivatives, do not exist.
This is enough to render, at least in general, not admissible the form of the gravitational tensor
taken by Einstein. The latter however had already felt some uneasiness, in particular when (12),
after having outlined with genial simplicity the theory of the gravitational waves, he was led to the
unacceptable result that also spontaneous waves should as a rule give rise to dispersion of energy
through irradiation.

“Since this fact” - these are his words - “should not happen in nature, it seems likely that
quantum theory should intervene by modifying not only Maxwell’s electrodynamics, but also the
new theory of gravitation”.

Actually there is no need of reaching to quanta. It is enough to correct the formal expression
of the gravitational tensor in the way shown here. Then the possibility of being confronted with
consequences not corresponding to the physical intuition is a priori excluded, in the case either of
free waves or of another purely gravitational phenomenon. In fact, by virtue of (10’) or, if one likes,
of the generalised d’Alembert’s principle, when the energy tensor Tik vanishes, the same occurrence
must happen to the gravitational tensor Aik. This fact entails total lack of stresses, of energy ﬂow,
and also of a simple localisation of energy.

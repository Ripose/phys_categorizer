Three Interesting 15th and 16th Century
Comet Sightings in Kashmiri Chronicles

Subhash Kak

February 2, 2008

Abstract

This note is about three interesting 15th and 16th century sight-
ings of comets in Kashmiri chronicles. We provide reasons for their
identiﬁcation as the 1468 S1, 1531 (Halley’s), and 1533 M1 comets.

Introduction

Indian chronicles have not been properly studied for their astronomical ref-
erences.
In particular, the reports of great comet sightings can help with
chronological questions and also provide information that is useful to the as-
tronomer. Here we consider the medieval Kashmiri chronicles, in particular
the continuation of the R¯ajatara ˙ngin.¯ı by ´Sr¯ıvara and Pr¯ajyabhat.t.a and ´Suka,
for their comet references. For those who cannot read the original Sanskrit,
one may consult Jogesh Chunder Dutt’s English translation (Dutt, 1898).

As background, Kashmir has a long tradition of historical writing. The
R¯ajatara ˙ngin.¯ı of Kalhan. a (Stein, 1900) gives an account of kings from their
mythical beginnings until 1150. Jonar¯aja, ´Sr¯ıvara, Pr¯ajyabhat.t.a and ´Suka
bring the narrative forward to the time of the incorporation of Kashmir in
the Mughal Empire by Akbar in 1586.

The dates in the Kashmiri texts are by the Laukika (Saptars.ı) calendar.
This calendar begins with 3076 BC, the year starting in March-April (Kak,
2000). The equation of conversion is, therefore,

4500 Laukika = 1424-5 AD

Comets are a commonly discussed subject in the Indian literature. One
of the longest chapters in Var¯ahamihira’s encyclopaedic Br.hat Sam. hit¯a (505
AD) is on comets (Bhat, 1981). A background to Indian astronomy and its
relationship with Mesopotamian and Greek astronomy is available elsewhere
(Kak, 2003a, 2003b).

The Comet of 1468

The reign of the good king Zain-ul-abidin (Jainoll¯abhad¯ına in Sanskrit chron-
icles), or Badashah, who ruled from 1420 to 1470, is described in the books
by Jonar¯aja and ´Sr¯ıvara. Jonar¯aja died in 1459 and the subsequent account
by ´Sr¯ıvara, who was the king’s minister, continues the story.

´Sr¯ıvara describes his comet in the last of the seven chapters of the book
that he devoted to the king’s reign. (He has three more books describing
the successors to this king.) This indicates that the comet made its visita-
tion near the end of the king’s rule. The description sets the stage for the
succession struggle between the king’s sons.

Here’s the description of the comet in Dutt’s translation:

Its long tail was of
A comet was seen at night in the north.
resplendent beauty. For a period of two months the comet was
visible in the clear sky. [Page 153]

This is interspersed with the supposed calamitous eﬀects of the comet.
For example: “The people saw signs of a severe calamity to the country which
had hitherto been happy under good government. [The comet] is the cause
of the destruction of men, even as excessive rain is of embankments. The
king remained anxious through fear of mischief that might happen.”

´Srivara does not explicitly mentioned the Laukika year when speaking of
the comet. But since the king died in 1470 and the succession war appears to
have taken several months, the year 1468 becomes clear. The comet appears
at about the winter harvesting, as its appearance comes at about the same
time as the entry into Kashmir of refugees from a famine in another, unnamed
country. The foreign refugees are likely to have become more numerous the
following spring as the text describes. This is followed by a series of events
that include the burning of the city of Suyyapura, the death of the queen,
the death of the king’s nephew in the province of Sindhu, and the drama of

2

the struggle for power between his three sons over a period of several months.
This brings us to 1470, when the king dies.

In summary, the description suggests that the comet arrived in the au-

tumn of 1468 and it lingered for two months.

A later passage further informs us:

An eclipse of the moon and of the sun took place within a fort-
night, as if meant to upset the king and thereby to destroy the
kingdom in which there had hitherto been no division. [Page 154]

This provides further evidence that can date the comet.

Conﬁrmation of the date

Modern tables on comets conﬁrm that in 1468, comet S1 was ﬁrst seen on
18 September with the maximum brightness date of 2 October. The comet
was visible for 56 days, conﬁrming the approximately stated period of two
months by ´Sr¯ıvara. The magnitude of this comet is estimated to be 1-2.

Calculations of solar eclipses reveal that soon after this period occurred
the solar eclipse of 9 July 1469 centered at the latitude of 69.3N and 134.8E
with a path width of 380 km and center duration of 4 minutes and 6 seconds.
The lunar eclipse of July 24, 1469 (ﬁfteen days later) conﬁrms the other
description in the text. Although the eclipses may not have been seen by
´Srivara personally, one must remember that the astronomy almanacs then,
as now, provided dates for the eclipses.

The Comets of 1531 and 1533

The comets of 1531 and 1533 are described in the book by Pr¯ajyabhat.t.a and
´Suka. The year and the month is mentioned. The ﬁrst of these is sighted in
the Laukika year 4607. The text reads:

In the year 4607, K¯aca Cakrapati, intending to ﬁght with the
M¯argapatis, moved his army and a comet appeared in the west.
[Page 369]

The Laukika 4607 is March-April 1531 to March-April 1532. But since
the Kashmiri winters are harsh, one must assume that this movement would
have occurred sometime before winter. That makes it the year 1531.

The Laukika year 4608 (1532) has continuing war and the sacking of the

towns by foreign invaders from the northwest. Next,

In the year 9, in the month of Jyes.t.ha, the Mughals returned to
their country, taking with them by force the wealth of the people,
and by treaty the daughter of the king. In this way calamity befell
the sinful people of the Sat¯ısara country [Kashmir], and a comet
was seen continuously in the sky on the east and on the west...
Stars fell from the sky on the ﬁelds where the full harvest of rice
was ripening, and the comet became again visible. [Page 373]

This second comet foreshadows a terrible famine, caused, no doubt, by rains
that destroyed the crops. This second comet, therefore, must have been seen
in the rains in July and later.

The comet 1531 was the Halley’s comet that had a maximum magnitude
of 1 and was visible starting August 5 for a period of 34 days is clearly the
one mentioned ﬁrst.

The next comet appears to have been 1533 M1, with maximum magnitude
of 0, that became visible on June 27, 1533 for a period of 83 days. We see
how its arrival is coincident with the ripening rice in the ﬁelds. One may
imagine that incessant rains beginning mid July, the skies remained overcast
and the rice crop was ruined. When the rain stopped, the comet was seen
again, for it remained visible until late September.

Discussion

We now know that another bright comet was observed in 1532, but it does not
ﬁnd a mention in the Chronicle. This was the comet R1 of maximum magni-
tude -1 that became visible on September 2 for a period of 120 days. But this
omission is understandable in light of the perilous situation in Kashmir that
year. According to the Chronicle, in the month of Agrah¯ayan. a in autumn,
the K¯ask¯ara king Saida Khana sent a general with twelve thousand cavalry
to sack Kashmir. The reputation for barbarity of the K¯ask¯arians (from the
mountains between east Afghanistan and Chitral) being worse than that of

4

the Turks, the Kashmiris simply ﬂed their homes. The K¯ask¯arians attacked
the twin capital cities. According to the Chronicle, “Hundreds of thousands
of low houses were burnt, and the brilliant city became like the ground for
burning the dead, fearful to look at its charred wood. Where will kings get
two such capitals in which millions had been spent in lime, wood, brick and
painting?” [Page 370-1]

The Kashmiri army regrouped in the south and the battles went on, in one
area, for three months. Ultimately, after many futile stands the Kashmiris
submitted to the invaders.

Having ﬂed their homes, in constant danger for their lives, attention was

not given to the arrival of the new comet in the sky.

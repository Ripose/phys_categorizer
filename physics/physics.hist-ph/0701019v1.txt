Abstract. The major contributions of Richard H. Dalitz to hypernuclear physics, since his ﬁrst paper in
1955 to his last one in 2005 covering a span of 50 years during which he founded and led the theoretical
study of hypernuclei, are reviewed from a personal perspective. Topical remarks on the search for quasi-
bound ¯K-nuclear states are made.

1 Introduction

Dick Dalitz was born in Dimboola, in the state of Vic-
toria, Australia, on February 28th 1925, and gained B.A.
and B.Sc. degrees in Mathematics and Physics in 1944
and 1945, respectively, from the University of Melbourne.
He moved to Britain in 1946 for postgraduate studies at
Cambridge, and then worked at the University of Bris-
tol before joining in 1949 Rudolf Peierls in Birmingham.
There he completed and wrote up his Ph.D. thesis on
‘0+ → 0+ transitions in nuclei’, supervised by Nicholas
Kemmer of Cambridge, and subsequently became a Lec-
turer. He spent two years in the U.S. from 1953, holding
research positions at Cornell and Stanford, visiting also
Princeton and Brookhaven National Laboratory, and re-
turned as a Reader in Mathematical Physics to the Uni-
versity of Birmingham for a year before becoming Profes-
sor of Physics in the Enrico Fermi Institute for Nuclear
Studies and the Department of Physics at the University
of Chicago in 1956. He moved to Oxford in 1963 as a
Royal Society Research Professor, the post he held un-
til his retirement in 1990. In addition to the Dalitz Plot,
Dalitz Pair and the Castillejo-Dalitz-Dyson (CDD) Pole
that bear his name, he pioneered the theoretical study of
strange baryon resonances, of baryon spectroscopy in the
quark model, and of hypernuclei, to all of which he made
outstanding contributions. His formulation of the θ − τ
puzzle led to the discovery that parity is not a symme-
try of the weak interactions. A complete bibliography of
Dalitz’s works is available in Ref. [1].

During his postgraduate studies he spent a year work-
ing alongside Cecil Powell’s cosmic ray group at Bristol
and it was during this period that he took particular inter-
est in the strange particles that were beginning to appear
in cosmic rays and at particle accelerators. These included
the ﬁrst hyperfragment in 1952 [2] which inspired a lifelong
interest in hypernuclei. Later on, he made signiﬁcant con-
tributions to the strong interactions of the strange parti-

cles and their resonant states [3,4]. As early as 1959 Dalitz
and Tuan, by analysing the data on the strong interactions
of K − mesons with protons, predicted the existence of an
I = 0, J π = (1/2)− strange resonance about 20 MeV be-
low the K −p threshold [5]. This Λ(1405) resonance was
discovered two years later in the Berkeley hydrogen bub-
ble chamber, studying the reaction K −p → Σ + 3π for
several charge states [6]. The proximity of this s-wave πΣ
resonance to the ¯KN threshold suggested that it can be
generated by ¯KN − πΣ inter-hadron forces, and this was
shown in 1967 by Dalitz et al. to be possible within a dy-
namical model of SU(3)-octet vector-meson exchange [7]
which is, in fact, the underlying physical mechanism for
the Tomozawa-Weinberg leading term in the chiral ex-
pansion of the meson-baryon Lagrangian [8,9]. The vec-
tor mesons ρ, ω, K ⋆, φ, which were discovered in the years
1960-62, relying heavily on Dalitz plots for some of these,
were unknown when the Λ(1405) was predicted. In the
years to follow, Dalitz repeatedly considered the com-
pleteness of this dynamical picture, whether or not the
S-matrix pole of Λ(1405) due to the inter-hadron forces
need not be augmented by a CDD pole arising from inter-
quark forces upon allowing for an intermediate uds con-
ﬁguration. It is here that the earlier CDD discussion [10]
found a fertile physical ground.

Looking back years later at the development of his own
career, he made the following remarks [11] (which he rarely
allowed himself to make in public):

– Yes, as Gell-Mann said, pion physics was indeed the
central topic for theoretical physics in the mid 1950s,
and that was what the young theoretician was expected
to work on. The strange particles were considered gen-
erally to be an obscure and uncertain area of phenom-
ena, as some kind of dirt eﬀect which could not have
much role to play in the nuclear forces, whose com-
prehension was considered to be the purpose of our re-
search. Gell-Mann remarked that he spent the major

2

part of his eﬀort on pion physics in that period, and
I did the same, although with much less success, of
course.

– Fashions have always been strong in theoretical physics,
and that holds true today as much as ever. The young
physicist who is not working on those problems con-
sidered central and promising at the time, is at a dis-
advantage when he seeks a post. This tendency stems
from human nature, of course, but it is unfortunate,
I think, that the system operates in such a way as to
discourage the young physicist from following an inde-
pendent line of thought.

Although about 30% of his research papers were devoted
or connected to hypernuclei, Dalitz was primarily a par-
ticle physicist. This is reﬂected in the interview he gave
during HYP03 [12], where hypernuclei get only the follow-
ing two brief remarks:

– My interest in hypernuclear events developed particu-
larly well in Chicago because a young emulsion exper-
imenter, Riccardo Levi-Setti, whose work I had known
from his hypernuclear studies in Milan, came to the In-
stitute for Nuclear Studies at this time. We each ben-
eﬁted from the other, I think, and we got quite a lot
done.

– I was responsible for organizing particle-physics theory
in Oxford. Besides quark-model work, I still did work
on hypernuclear physics, much of this with Avraham
Gal of Jerusalem.

I ﬁrst met Dalitz as a young student attending the 1966
Varenna International School of Physics “Enrico Fermi”,
Course XXXVIII on ‘Interaction of High-Energy Particles
with Nuclei’. He gave a series of lectures on the status
of Hypernuclear Physics, and I was lucky to have been
able to intercept him during one of the lectures with an
important omission he made in a calculation which my
shell-model background education at the Weizmann In-
stitute gave me an advantage over him in calculating it
correctly. This was the beginning of a very close collabo-
ration lasting about 20 years during which we would often
meet for joint periods of work, always discussing the lat-
est experimental results and their likely interpretations.
I have been amazed at Dalitz’s encyclopaedic knowledge
and mastery of measurements and calculations in particle
physics and also of many aspects of nuclear physics, his
critical assessment of experimental results and his thor-
oughness at work. He always insisted on and managed
to calculate things in his own way, relying only on facts,
never on fancy. Our ways parted oﬀ after 1985, but we still
maintained a close relationship until very recently, when I
edited his last publication, the talk he gave at HYP03 [13].

2 Λ hypernuclei

2.1 The beginning

ΛH, 4

titled Charge independence in light hyperfragments [14]. It
focused on the near equality of the (4
ΛHe) binding en-
ergies and its origin in the charge symmetry of the ΛN in-
teraction, and on the exceedingly small binding energy of
3
ΛH, the only bound A = 3 hypernucleus marking the on-
set of Λ-hypernuclear binding. By 1959 his analyses of the
light, s-shell hyperfragments led him to state [15] that the
existence of a bound Λ-nucleon system is strongly excluded
and that the analysis of the T = 1 triplet 3
Λn in-
dicates that these systems are not expected to form bound
states, and that these essential conclusions would not be
seriously aﬀected if there exist moderately strong three-
body forces arising from pion exchange processes. He re-
turned in 1972 to consider the possible eﬀects of three-
body ΛN N forces in the s shell [16] quantifying what
has been since called ‘the overbinding problem’, namely
that the binding energy of 5
ΛHe comes out too large by
2 − 3 MeV in any calculation that ﬁts well the binding
energies of the lighter hypernuclei.1

ΛHe, 3

ΛH, 3

In a series of works covering three decades, he used the
main Λ → pπ− weak-decay mode of light hypernuclear
species studied in emulsion and bubble chambers to de-
termine their ground-state spins and, thereby, to gain in-
formation on the spin dependence of the ΛN force. When
he had begun this line of works, just before parity viola-
tion was realised during the turbulent 1956-1957 period,
he wrongly concluded in a talk given at the 6th Annual
Rochester Conference on High Energy Nuclear Physics in
April 1956 that the triplet ΛN s-wave interaction was
stronger than the singlet one [17]. His argument was based
on assuming that parity was respected in the weak decay
ΛH → π− + 4He. Since the ﬁnal products all had spin
4
zero, and the pion was known to have a negative intrinsic
parity with respect to nucleons, (quoting Dalitz, in ital-
ics) the spin-parity possibilities for the (4
ΛHe) doublet
are 0−, 1+, 2−, etc. Assuming (at that time it was still
uncertain) that the Λ hyperon had spin-parity (1/2)+, the
spin-parity of 4
ΛH had to be 1+, and this meant that the
triplet ΛN s-wave interaction was stronger than the sin-
glet one, and one also concludes that the spin-parity for
ΛH is (3/2)+. Of course we now know that this was wrong;
3
and indeed soon after Dalitz himself, realising the merits
of the strong spin selectivity provided by parity violation
in the weak-interaction pionic decays of Λ hypernuclei,
calculated the branching ratios of the π− two-body de-
cays of 4
ΛH to the daughter ground states of 4He
and 3He, respectively, in order to determine unambigu-
ously the ground-state spins of the parent hypernuclei [18]
which in a few years became experimentally established as
0+ [19] and (1/2)+ [20] respectively. This led to the correct
ordering of the triplet and singlet ΛN s-wave interactions
as we understand it todate.

2.2 The later years

Dalitz’s work on the p-shell hypernuclei, dates back to
1963 when together with Levi Setti, in their only joint pa-
1 this need not be the case once ΛN − ΣN coupling is ex-

Dalitz pioneered the theoretical study of hypernuclei. His
ﬁrst published work on Λ hypernuclei dates back to 1955,

plicitly allowed in.

per [21], Some possibilities for unusual light hypernuclei
were discussed, notably the neutron-rich isotopes of 6
ΛH
and 8
ΛHe belonging to I = 3/2 multiplets, but his sys-
tematic research of the p-shell hypernuclei started in 1967
together with me laying the foundations for a shell-model
analysis of Λ hypernuclei. As early as 1969 data on ex-
cited states were reported with the Λ hyperon in a (1p)Λ
state coupled to the nuclear ground-state conﬁguration,
ﬁrst from emulsion data [22,23] observing proton decay in
some special instances such as 12
Λ C, and later on through
in-ﬂight (K −, π−) experiments at CERN and BNL. In the
particular case of the 12
Λ C excited cluster of states about
11 MeV above the (1s)Λ ground state, Dalitz participated
actively in the ﬁrst round of theoretical analysis for both
types of experiments [24,25]. However, confronting these
and similar data posed two diﬃculties which we identi-
ﬁed and discussed during 1976. The ﬁrst one was con-
nected to understanding the nature of the Λ continuum
spectrum which, owing to the small momentum transfer
in the forward-direction (K −, π−) reaction in ﬂight, was
thought to consist of well deﬁned Λ-hypernuclear excita-
tions. It was not immediately recognised that since the Λ
hyperon did not have to obey the Pauli exclusion princi-
ple with nucleons, hypernuclear quasi-free excitation was
possible even at extremely small values of the momen-
tum transfer, a possibility that was pointed out and anal-
ysed quantitatively by us [26] following the ﬁrst round
of data taken by the Heidelberg-Saclay collaboration at
the CERN-PS in 1975. The other diﬃculty was connected
with understanding the role of coherent excitations in the
(1p)Λ continuum, the so called ‘substitutional’ or ‘ana-
logue’ states, where the early theoretical concept of ana-
logue states stemmed from considerations of octet-SU(3)
unitary symmetry. Already in his ﬁrst discussion of these
states in 1969 [27], Dalitz recognised that the strong exci-
tation of these states does not depend on SU(3) symme-
try. In fact it is reasonable to believe that SU(3) symme-
try has almost no relevance to the relationship between
Λ-hypernuclei and nuclei...simply because the mass dif-
ference of 80 MeV between the Λ and Σ hyperons...is a
very large energy relative to the typical energies associated
with nuclear excitations. This diﬃculty was eliminated by
Kerman and Lipkin [28] who suggested in 1971 to con-
sider the Sakata triplet-SU(3) unitary symmetry version
in which the proton, neutron and Λ were degenerate. This
suggestion was further limited by us in 1976 to (1p)p,n,Λ
states and, together with Pauli-spin SU(2) symmetry, led
to the consideration of Pauli-Sakata SU(6) supermulti-
plets encompassing nuclei and hypernuclei [29], in direct
generalisation of Wigner’s supermultiplet theory of spin-
isospin SU(4) symmetry in light nuclei. The analysis of
these SU(6) supermultiplets proved very useful for the de-
velopment of shell model techniques in the 1980s and on
by John Millener and collaborators [30]. In particular, the
1976 work focused on the concept of the ‘supersymmetric’
state in addition to the ‘analogue’ state, with the low-
lying supersymmetric state arising from the non existence
of a Pauli exclusion principle between the Λ hyperon and
nucleons.

2.3 Lasting contributions

I wish to highlight two contributions which are likely to
remain with us and become textbook chapters in hyper-
nuclear physics.

(i) Dalitz’s outstanding contribution in the 1960s to weak
interactions in hypernuclei, together with Martin Block
[31], was to formulate the ΛN → N N phenomenol-
ogy of non-mesonic weak-interaction decay modes that
dominate the decays of medium-weight and heavy hy-
pernuclei, a process that cannot be studied on free
baryons and which oﬀers new systems, Λ hypernuclei,
for exploring the little understood ∆I = 1/2 rule in
non-leptonic weak interactions. This subject was dis-
cussed thoroughly in HYP06 (talks by H. Outa and by
G. Garbarino, in these Proceedings) but more exper-
imentation is needed before the underlying physics is
fully understood.

(ii) Another pioneering contribution, in the 1970s, follow-
ing the introduction of shell-model techniques [32] was
to chart the production and γ-ray decay schemes antic-
ipated for excited states in light Λ hypernuclei in order
to derive the complete spin dependence of the ΛN in-
teraction eﬀective in these hypernuclei [33]. This work,
which I was fortunate to coauthor, was further devel-
oped together with John Millener and Carl Dover [34],
serving as a useful guide to the hypernuclear γ-ray
measurements completed in the last few years, at BNL
and at KEK [35], which yielded full determination of
the spin dependence in the low-lying spectrum (talks
by H. Tamura and by D.J. Millener, in these Proceed-
ings).

3 ΛΛ hypernuclei

Dalitz in fact anticipated that ΛΛ hypernuclei be observed
and that as a rule they would be particle stable with re-
spect to the strong interaction. His Letter titled The ΛΛ-
hypernucleus and the Λ − Λ interaction [36] appeared as
soon as the news of the ﬁrst observed ΛΛ-hypernucleus
10
ΛΛBe was reported in 1963 [37] and was followed by a reg-
ular paper [38]. He did not work on ΛΛ hypernuclei for
a long period, until 1989, apparently because there were
hardly new experimental developments in this ﬁeld except
for the 6
ΛΛHe dubious event reported by Prowse in 1966.
He returned to this subject in 1989 [39] feeling the need to
scrutinize carefully the interpretation of the 10
ΛΛBe event
and its implications in view of a renewed experimental in-
terest to search for the H-dibaryon. This scientiﬁc chapter
in Dalitz’s life is described in Don Davis’ companion talk
in these Proceedings.

4 Σ hypernuclei

Dalitz was puzzled by the CERN-PS low-statistics evi-
dence in the beginning of the 1980, and subsequently by
the KEK-PS low-statistics evidence in 1985, for relatively

4

narrow Σ-hypernuclear peaks in the continuum. The large
ΣN → ΛN low-energy cross section, due primarily to the
strong pion exchange potential, did not leave much room
for narrow Σ states in nuclei; indeed, the ﬁrst rough es-
timate by Gal and Dover [40] gave nuclear-matter widths
of order ΓΣ ∼ 25 MeV. The suggestion by these authors
that some Σ-hypernuclear levels could selectively become
fairly narrow due to the S = 1, I = 1/2 dominance of
the ΣN → ΛN transition fascinated him to the extent
that he argued favorably for the validity of this interpre-
tation in his 1980 Nature article Discrete Σ-hypernuclear
states [41], although taking it with a grain of salt. He came
back to this subject in 1989, after hearing in HYP88 at
Padova Hayano’s report of the KEK experiment [42] ﬁnd-
ing evidence for a 4
ΣHe near-threshold narrow state. Re-
calling some old bubble-chamber data on K −-absorption
yields in 4He near the Σ threshold, he questioned together
with Davis and Deloﬀ [43] the compatibility of assigning
this 4
ΣHe as a quasi-bound state with the older data: Is
there a bound 4
ΣHe? He came back to these questions with
Deloﬀ in both HYP91 in Shimoda and HYP94 in Vancou-
ver [44,45].

5 Exotic structures

I have already mentioned that Dalitz was far from jump-
ing on band wagons of speculative ideas unless there were
some good experimental or phenomenological tests to be
made in a concrete manner. In this context one ﬁnds
a Nature paper coauthored by Dalitz, Growing drops of
strange matter [46], discussing a possible scenario for get-
ting into strange quark matter. It is therefore interesting
to wonder how Dalitz would have reacted to the ﬂood
of recent reports on the possible existence of ¯K-nuclear
bound states and on the ongoing experimental searches
for such objects. The methodology adopted in the KEK
and in the Frascati dedicated experiments discussed in
the HYP06 conference was to use stopped K − reactions,
partly relying on Akaishi and Yamazaki’s production rate
estimate of ∼ 2% per stopped K − in 4He [47]. This esti-
mate is totally unacceptable since a similar production
rate is known to hold at rest for (the most favorable)
A = 4 hypernuclei [48]; hypernuclei are produced via the
dominant absorptive K −N → πY modes, whereas the
K −N → N ¯K backward-elastic mode responsible for re-
placing a bound nucleon by a bound ¯K is suppressed at
rest with respect to the former reactive modes owing to
the 1/v law near threshold. Realistic estimates should give
rates of order 10−4 or less, per stopped K −, for the pro-
duction of ¯K-nuclear bound states. In-ﬂight K − reactions
are more promising, but unfortunately will not be feasible
before J-PARC is operated, from 2009 on. Preliminary
(K −, p) and (K −, n) spectra at plab = 1 GeV/c on 12C
obtained in KEK-E548 show only appreciable strength in
the ¯K bound-state region, but no peaks [49], in accordance
with a recent in-ﬂight reaction calculation [50]. Given this
situation, the use of other methods, using proton or an-
tiproton beams, or nucleus-nucleus collisions, has been ad-

vocated. Let me mention brieﬂy some of the recent claims
in this rather speculative area.

A preliminary evidence for a broad peak in the Λd
invariant-mass spectrum at Minv(Λd) = 3159 ± 20 MeV,
and a width Γ = 100 ± 50 MeV, was reported recently by
the FOPI detector collaboration at GSI [51] in a study of
ΛX correlations (X = p, d, t...) in Ni+Ni collisions at 1.93
GeV/A. This is barely compatible with the very narrow
peak at 3140 MeV reported in the E471 KEK 4He(K −, n)
experiment [52] as an evidence for the I = 0, ¯KN N N
deeply bound narrow state predicted by Akaishi and Ya-
mazaki [47] and recently withdrawn (M. Iwasaki, these
Proceedings). However, the Λd peak observed in the GSI
experiment could be correlated with the Λp relatively nar-
row peak observed in ¯p − 4He annihilation at rest by the
OBELIX spectrometer collaboration at the LEAR facility
in CERN (T. Bressani, these Proceedings and in Ref. [53])
provided it is accompanied by an unseen neutron specta-
tor. It should be noted that the statistical signiﬁcance of
∼ 160 MeV
these two peaks that imply deep binding B ¯K
is not particularly high, 4.5 and 4 respectively.2

Recently, the FOPI collaboration at GSI reported a
more robust evidence for another peak [54] which naively
would be interpreted as due to a deeply bound K −pp,
by detecting Λp pairs in both Ni+Ni and Al+Al colli-
sions. Preliminary results are shown in Fig. 1, where the
Λp invariant mass peaks near the ΣN threshold, with
mass uncertainty of about 20 MeV and with a substan-
tial width. In contrast, the invariant mass corresponding
to the signal assigned to K −pp by the FINUDA spec-
trometer collaboration [55] is marked by a vertical dashed
line across the shown spectra, with no peaking whatso-
ever. The possibility of a resonance or cusp phenomenon
for the Λp system, at or near the opening of the ΣN
threshold, has always intrigued Dalitz. However, I dare
say that had he been with us today, he would have con-
sidered favorably another possibility, that the light, only
Σ hypernucleus known to be bound, 4
ΣHe is the source of
these Λp pairs. The binding energy of this hypernucleus
is B = 4.4 ± 0.3(stat) ± 1(syst) MeV, with respect to the
Σ+ + 3H threshold, and the value of width assigned to it
is Γ = 7.0 ± 0.7 + 1.2 MeV [56]. Its quantum numbers are
I = 1/2, J π = 0+ [57] with all four baryons in s states. In
particular, it may be viewed in isospace as a linear com-
bination of Σ+ coupled to 3H and Σ0 coupled to 3He. Its
wavefunction is schematically given by:

Ψ (4

ΣHe) = α(ΣN )S=0
+ β(ΣN )S=1

I=1/2,3/2(N N )S=0
I=1
I=1/2(N N )S=1
I=0 ,

(1)

where only the spin-isospin structure is speciﬁed. The de-
ΣHe is dominated by the (ΣN → ΛN )S=1
cay of 4
I=1/2 two-
body transition, proceeding therefore through the compo-
nent with amplitude β in which the N N composition is
pn. This means that the ΣN composition is a mixture of

2 Bendiscioli et al. [53] also reported a Λd peak with sta-
tistical signiﬁcance ∼ 3 at Minv(Λd) = 3190 ± 15 MeV, with
Γ ≤ 60 MeV, which would correspond to an I = 0, ¯KN N N
state bound by about 120 NeV.

Σ+n and Σ0p, both of which decay to Λp. One expects
then 4
ΣHe to decay dominantly by emitting back-to-back
Λp pairs with slower ‘spectator’ proton and neutron which
will somewhat distort the ΣN → Λp two-body kinematics.
A more conclusive proof for this suggestion would come
from the observation of back-to-back Λ3He pairs in the
ΣHe → Λ + 3He. The branching ratio for
two-body decay 4
this decay relative to the inclusive ΛX decay rate is per-
haps a few percent, as may be argued by analogy with
the approximately 8%(5%) branching ratio measured for
ΛHe) → n + 3He(4He) relative
the nonmesonic decay 4

ΛHe) [58,59]. Irre-
spective of whether or not the above conjecture of 4
ΣHe
production is correct for the FOPI-Detector GSI exper-
iments, it would be a wise practice for ¯K-nuclear bound
state searches in heavy ion collisions to ﬁrst look for known
hypernuclear signals in order to determine their produc-
tion rates as calibration and normalization standards.

6 Concluding remarks

Dalitz’s lifelong study of hypernuclei was central to his
career as a phenomenologically inclined theoretical physi-
cist. His style was unique. Asked by then his student Chris
Llewellyn Smith about ‘new theories’, Dalitz responded

– My job is not to make theories - it’s to understand the

data,

he saw the theorist’s role as being to ﬁnd a way of repre-
senting experimental data so that they directly reveal na-
ture’s secrets, as the Dalitz Plot had done [60]. His life-
long nourishment of hypernuclei has shaped and outlined
for the last 50 years a ﬁeld that is now maturing into a
broader context of Strangeness Nuclear Physics. His wise
and critical business-like attitude will be missed as new
experimental facilities are inaugurated with the promise
of discovering new facets of this ﬁeld.

Physical Framework of Quantization Problem1

Marius Grigorescu

Abstract: The paper presents shortly the geometric approach to the prob-
lem of a general quantization formalism, both physically meaningful and
mathematically consistent.
Key words: old quantum mechanics, geometric quantization.

The notion of quantization has appeared at the beginning of the cen-
tury in the theory of heat radiation, since M. Planck has formulated the
hypothesis of the energy quanta [1]. This hypothesis assumed a ﬁnite num-
ber of ways to distribute the energy of the ν-frequency radiation over a given
number of oscillators, every distribution assigning to each oscillator integer
multiples of the ”energy quantum” ǫ = hν, h = 6.626 × 10−34 J·s. Later
on, the Planck’s hypothesis was interpreted as a consequence of a ”quan-
tum constraint” acting in general on the harmonic oscillator considered as
classical system. Thus, the problem of quantization was to ”select an inﬁ-
nite, discrete number of quantum possible real motions, from the continuous
manifold of all mechanically possible motions” [2], by an appropriate system
of constraints. The action of these constraints on the classical motion as a
whole, and not on the physical state at a given time, has suggested to express
them as restrictions on the geometrical quantities associated with the trajec-
tory in the space of the classical states. These states were identiﬁed with the
points of the phase space, locally parameterized by generalized coordinates
and momenta. The dimensional equality between the constant h and the
classical action has allowed to select the quantum trajectories for the separa-
ble systems with multiple periodic motions by using the conditions of Bohr,
pkdqk,
Wilson and Sommerfeld (BWS), requiring the phase integrals Jk =
k = 1, 2, ...n, (n is the number of freedom degrees) to be integer multiples of

the ”action” quantum h:

Jk =

pkdqk = nkh, nk = 0, 1, 2, ...

Because pk is given by the solution S(q1, q2, ..., qn, α1, α2, ..., αn) of the Hamilton-
Jacobi equation:

∂q ≡ { ∂S
∂qk , the condition (1) selects
a discrete set of integration constants {α1, α2, ..., αn} corresponding to the
quantum allowed motions.

The application of these quantization formulas has led to a description in
agreement with the experiment for the energy levels of the hydrogen atom, or
for the Stark and Zeeman eﬀects. Also, by quantizing the relativistic Kepler
problem, the ﬁne structure of the spectral lines was explained.

Besides its success, the method of phase integrals quantization was faced
with various shortcomings, and in particular it was not able to give a quan-
tum description for the free micro-particles. In 1924 Louis de Broglie has
formulated the principle of duality, extending the double nature of light, as
wave and particle, to all forms of matter. So, to a free micro-particle without
spin, having the energy E = mc2, m = m0/
1 − v2/c2, m0 = the rest mass,
a scalar plane wave having the frequency ν = E/h, the wavelength λ = h/mv
and the group velocity vg = dω

d(mv) = v, was associated.

dk = dE

The wave associated to the micro-particles placed in potential force ﬁelds
was obtained by extending the correspondence between the geometrical and
wave optics. Within the geometrical optics, the way of the light rays may be
equivalently described by the wave surfaces S(x, y, z) = constant, orthogonal
to the rays. The equation determining the function S is formally identical
with the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and it can be obtained from the wave
equation written for monochromatic waves in the limit of small wave-lengths.
This correspondence, together with de Broglie’s formulas for the free parti-
cle, has suggested a ”kinematic” quantization, by expressing the refraction
index from the monochromatic waves equation through the classical poten-
tial energy. The ﬁnal equation obtained for the wave function Ψ, written
as

with E and V the total and the potential energy, respectively, has accurately
solved the problem of the energy spectra for all the potentials known as
physically relevant.

Intending to establish a dynamical equation, able to describe the time-
evolution of the micro-particles, the equation (3) was generalized, but the
result was proved to be a breakdown with the classical wave picture. Thus,
by contrast to the classical equation for real waves, the fundamental quantum
dynamical equation:

ˆHΨ = i¯h

∂Ψ
∂t

(4)

∂q , s = − ∂S

∂q , ˆs = −i¯h ∂

contains only the ﬁrst order time-derivatives of Ψ. This equation can be
found by acting on Ψ with the operator equation resulting when the deriva-
tives p = ∂S
∂t from the time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equation
H(p, q, t) = −s, are replaced by the operators ˆp = −i¯h ∂
∂t, but in
general the non-commutativity of ˆp and q leads to ambiguities in the deﬁni-
tion of the operator ˆH. Consequently, the further line of reasoning was to
take the dynamics of Ψ as basically independent on a underlying classical pic-
ture, and to see the correspondence between the operator ˆH and the classical
Hamilton function H(p, q, t), if any, merely as an accident. Within the new
formulation, known as quantum mechanics, the function Ψ is not an observ-
able, and moreover, it is not a wave in the usual three-dimensional space,
but it is a representative element for the ”quantum state” of the system.
This state is a ray in an abstract Hilbert space H, without any classical cor-
respondent, associated to the quantum system. Its dynamics is determined
by the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (4), where ˆH is a self-adjoint
operator deﬁned on a dense domain in H. Because the rays of H and the
operators on H are not observables, the ”quantization problem” was appar-
ently elliminated, but in fact it was shifted towards the connection with the
experiment. Before analyzing more closely this problem, it is interesting to
remark that even the fundamental quantum equation (4) contains a variable
considered to be classically deﬁned, namely the time t. More generally, the
whole space-time framework is classical, and all the observables are classical
quantities, subject to classical dynamics.

Deﬁning the value of an observable in a given state Ψ as the mean-value
hΨ| ˆA|Ψi of a symmetric operator ˆA which is associated to the observable,
the kinematic task of the quantization problem was to construct the Hilbert
space H and the correspondence between observables and operators. To ob-

3

tain this correspondence, Dirac (1930) has suggested an algebraic method
based on the construction of an isomorphism between the Lie algebra of the
operators on H and the Poisson algebra of the observables [3]. Considering
the set of observables be represented by the set F (M) of the smooth real
functions over a classical phase space (M, ω), with ω the globally deﬁned
symplectic form, then it becomes a Lie algebra deﬁning the Poisson bracket
{·, ·} by:

{f, g} = ω(Xf , Xg) = LXf g, f, g ∈ F (M) .

Here Xf is the vector ﬁeld determined by iXf ω = df , and LXf denotes the
Lie derivative with respect to Xf . In the case when M = T ∗Q, Q = Rn,

the symplectic form is ω0 =
of Q was deﬁned as an R-linear map f → ˆf from F (M) to a set A(H) of
symmetric operators on the Hilbert space H, having the folowing properties
[4]:
1. the map ˆ : F (M) → A(H) is injective.
2. [ ˆf , ˆg] = i¯hˆ{f, g}, f, g ∈ F (M).
3. ˆ1 = I, where 1 is the unity function constant on M, and I is the identity
operator on H.
4. ˆqk, ˆpk, k = 1, ..., n act irreducibly on H.

The ﬁrst condition requires to have an associated quantum operator for

each observable.

The second condition may be taken as the consequence of the time-
independence of the map ˆ for a wide class of dynamical systems on (M, ω),
and is directly related to the dynamical problem of quantization. In particu-
lar, if the observable f ∈ F (M) has a complete Hamiltonian ﬁeld (the integral
curves ct through c0 = m given by ˙ct = Xf (ct) are deﬁned for ∀t ∈ (−∞, ∞),
∀m ∈ M), then the associated operator ˆf must be self-adjoint, and generates
ˆf t).

The third condition is imposed by the construction of the observables,
accounting for the uncertainty relations of Heisenberg, or for the empiric
wave-particle duality. Among the observables there are also constants which

¯h

are not naturally associated to the phase-space geometry, as the interaction
strengths, the electric charge, or the mass. These act multiplicatively on the
state vectors, as any real constants, behaving as multiples of the identity op-
erator on H. The third condition requires to quantize all the constants in the
same way, irrespective if these are coming from the Poisson bracket of some
observables (as the canonically conjugate coordinates), or if they represent
dynamical constants of the classical system. In particular, the Heisenberg
uncertainty relations are a consequence of this condition, proving its suﬃ-
ciency.

The fourth condition accounts for the requirement of expressing the ac-
tion of every operator associated to an observable through the action of the
operators (ˆqk, ˆpk), k = 1, ..., n. This requirement corresponds to the classi-
cal condition of expressing every observable as a function of the particular
observables represented by the canonical coordinates (qk, pk), k = 1, ..., n on
the phase space. Showing that every irreducible representation of the algebra
C0 ≡ (q1, q2, ..., qn, p1, p2, ..., pn, 1) is unitarily equivalent to the Schr¨odinger
representation, where H = L2(Rn), ˆqk = qk, ˆpk = −i¯h ∂
∂qk , the Stone - von
Neumann theorem (1932) [4] has given explicitly the space H and the map
f → ˆf.

In 1951 van Hove has proved rigorously the incompatibility between the
four conditions stated above, proving therefore the impossibility of a com-
plete quantization [4]. Moreover, he has shown that it is possible to fulﬁll the
ﬁrst three conditions, obtaining a ”prequantization”, but then the algebra C0
is represented with inﬁnite multiplicity. Also, if only the last three conditions
are imposed, then the application ˆ must be restricted to some subalgebra
C ⊂ F (M), containing C0. In particular, the polynomial Hamiltonians quan-
tizable within the Schr¨odinger representation are at most of second degree
in coordinates and momenta.

These results have shown that the problem of the algebraic quantization
has no meaning for the set of all observables contained in F (M), but only
for a couple of subalgebras, (C0(M), C(M)), C0(M) ⊂ C(M) ⊂ F (M), with
C0 represented irreducibly.

For the manifolds (M, ω) which are not diﬀeomorphic to (T ∗Rn, ω0), (the
de Rahm cohomology class [ω]dR 6= 0), the canonical coordinates (qk, pk),
k = 1, 2, ..., n are only locally deﬁned and are not observables, so that the
fourth condition must be reformulated. A direct generalization concerns the

5

homogeneous symplectic spaces (M, ω) onto which a Lie group G acts tran-
sitively and strongly symplectic. The action of G is deﬁned globally by a ho-
momorphism σ : G → Ham(M) and locally by the map dσ : g → ham(M).
Here Ham(M) is the group of Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphisms of M, g denotes
the Lie algebra of G, and ham(M) is the Lie algebra of Hamiltonian ﬁelds
on M. A lift of the map dσ is a Lie algebra homomorphism λ : g → F (M)
[5] such that the following diagram is commutative.

(with µ0 : g → F (M) any linear map making the diagram to commute), has
a vanishing de Rahm class [µ]dR ∈ H 2(g, R) [5] [6]. Using the map λ, the
fourth condition deﬁning the Hilbert space can be formulated as:
If (M, ω) is a strong symplectic homogeneous G-space, and λ is a lift
4’.
of the map dσ, then the subalgebra C of the quantizable observables must
contain the subspace λ(g), and the representation Hilbert space H must be
irreducible with respect to the action of the operators from ˆ(λ(g)) [7].

As a ﬁrst step towards quantization, the prequantization of the algebra
F (M) was obtained geometrically [6] - [8] by constructing a Hilbert space
HM as a space ΓL of sections in a hermitian line bundle with connection
(L, α) over (M, ω). Requiring the symplectic form ω to be the curvature of
the connection [6] (dπ∗α = ω, with π : L → M the projection on the base
in L), the line bundle exists only in special cases, namely when ω fulﬁlls
the Weil’s integrality condition: h−1[ω]dR ∈ Z. This condition acts similarly
to the BWS condition of the old quantum mechanics, selecting the classi-
cal manifolds of observables compatible with the description of a quantum
system. In particular, for the integrable systems the Weil condition for the
reduced phase space and BWS quantization rule become the same.

In the case M = T ∗Rn the prequantum Hilbert space HM is represented

by:

L2(R2n) = {Ψ : M → C,

|Ψ|2|ωn| < ∞}

(7)

where |ωn| is the natural volume on R2n. Because this space is too large
for quantization, it was investigated the possibility to extract a ”quantum
subspace” HP ⊂ HM generated by the sections from ΓL which are constant
on the leaves of an integrable foliation of M by Lagrangean submanifolds (a
polarization P on M). The subspace HP is not invariant to the action of all
the operators associated with observables, and consequently the subalgebra
of the observables quantizable within HP is CP = {f ∈ F (M), ˆf HP ⊂ HP }.
This procedure of quantization has the advantage of giving a natural cor-
respondence between the spaces HP and HP ′ associated to diﬀerent polar-
izations P and P ′, as subspaces of the whole prequantum space HM . Unfor-
tunately, it cannot be physically accepted because in many important cases,
including the Schr¨odinger quantization of T ∗Rn, HP does not exist.

An alternative solution is to construct an intrinsic Hilbert space H[µ]
P as-
sociated to the polarization P independently of the prequantum space HM .
With some enough general restrictions, the space H[µ]
P corresponds to a class
of measures [µ], Lebesgue equivalent, deﬁned on a Lagrangean submanifold
Q ⊂ M, transversal to P , whose elements are called half-densities. This
formalism has solved the problem of quantization for a wide class of phys-
ically relevant Hamiltonians, but the results are still slightly diﬀerent from
those obtained by using the standard quantum mechanics, well supported
by experiments. Thus, the energy ǫn = nhν, n = 0, 1, 2, ... predicted for
the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is diﬀerent from the correct result
ǫn = (n + 1/2)hν [7]. Such diﬀerences were further eliminated by assigning
a metalinear structure to the Lagrangean submanifold Q, and correspond-
ingly extending the half-densities Hilbert space H[µ]
P to a Hilbert space of
Λ1/2
half-forms H
[7]. As a rule, its construction is cumbersome, and the half-
P
forms quantization was tested only for a small number of simple systems.

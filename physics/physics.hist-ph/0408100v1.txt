More on the early interpretation of the
Schwarzschild solution

Abstract

G. Lemaˆitre was apparently the ﬁrst to make an explicit coordinate trans-
formation resulting in the removal of the singularity at r = a = 2m in the
Schwarzschild metric, while C. Lanczos was the ﬁrst to express doubts on
the physical reality of that singularity since it could be introduced or removed
by a transformation of coordinates.

In a recent paper Hans-J¨urgen Schmidt [1] emphasized the important contribu-
tion made by J.L. Synge in 1950 to the clariﬁcation of the physical interpretation
of the Schwarzschild black hole at its horizon [2].

The paper of Synge is indeed remarkable, especially because it “contains
many interesting results all of them being discussed in details” [3]. What is also
remarkable is that Synge’s paper is greatly inspired by the work of G. Lemaˆitre, who
apparently was the ﬁrst to have made an explicit transformation of coordinates to
remove the singularity at r = a = 2m in the Schwarzschild metric [4]. Moreover,
Synge mentions H.P. Robertson’s lectures in 1939 at the University of Toronto,
which drew his attention to Lemaˆitre’s paper, as well as to similar results obtained
by H.P. Robertson.

Therefore, while Synge’s paper is certainly an outstanding achievement, it is
not the ﬁrst in which the Schwarzschild horizon was correctly interpreted. In fact,
according to Jean Eisenstaedt [5]:

“The ﬁrst expert to cast doubt on the reality of the singular character
[of the Schwarzschild solution] at r = 2m was Cornelius Lanczos [6].
[...] Lanczos introduced a new “singularity” [i.e., the Schwarzschild
singularity] at a place where the metric was completely regular before,
thus showing the relativity of the then vague concept of a singularity.”

Hence, by introducing rather than removing a singular term, Lanczos did the
“opposite” of what Lemaˆitre was apparently the ﬁrst to have done. Furthermore,
generalizing from the case of the Schwarzschild metric, Lanczos concluded his
paper by stressing that [6, p.539]:

“this example proves how little one might conclude from a singular
behavior of the gij functions about a real singularity of the ﬁeld, for it
can possibly be eliminated by a coordinate transformation.”

This paper by Lanczos was his ﬁrst publication after his doctoral dissertation:
a ﬁeld theoretical interpretation of electrodynamics in which singularities of the
homogeneous Maxwell’s equations are interpreted as electrons [7, 8]. This may
explain why Lanczos paied so much attention to singularities in Einstein’s ﬁeld,
and consequently published several seminal papers related to singularities, surface
distributions of matter, and junction conditions in general relativity [9].

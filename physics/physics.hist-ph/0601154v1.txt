Einstein, in his “Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K¨orper”, gave a physical (operational) meaning

to “time” of a remote event in describing “motion” by introducing the concept of “synchronous

stationary clocks located at diﬀerent places”. But with regard to “place” in describing motion, he

assumed without analysis the concept of a system of co-ordinates.

In the present paper, we propose a way of giving physical (operational) meaning to the concepts

of “place” and “co-ordinate system”, and show how the observer can deﬁne both the place and time

of a remote event. Following Einstein, we consider another system “in uniform motion of translation

relatively to the former”. Without assuming “the properties of homogeneity which we attribute to

space and time”, we show that the deﬁnitions of space and time in the two systems are linearly

related. We deduce some novel consequences of our approach regarding faster-than-light observers

and particles, “one-way” and “two-way” velocities of light, symmetry, the “group property” of in-

ertial reference frames, length contraction and time dilatation, and the “twin paradox”. Finally, we

point out a ﬂaw in Einstein’s argument in the “Electrodynamical Part” of his paper and show that

the Lorentz force formula and Einstein’s formula for transformation of ﬁeld quantities are mutually

consistent. We show that for faster-than-light bodies, a simple modiﬁcation of Planck’s formula for

mass suﬃces. (Except for the reference to Planck’s formula, we restrict ourselves to Physics of 1905.)

Keywords: operational meaning, co-ordinate system, representation.

1 EINSTEIN, RADAR AND GPS

1.1 Einstein’s Synchronous Clocks

In the “Kinematical Part” of Einstein’s celebrated “Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K¨orper”(all

Einstein quotations are from the English translation in 1, except for two quotations from 2), he

remarked: “If we wish to describe the motion of a material point, we give the values of its co-

ordinates as functions of the time. Now we must bear carefully in mind that a mathematical

description of this kind has no physical meaning unless we are quite clear as to what we understand

by “time””. He then introduced, “with the help of certain imaginary physical experiments”, the

concept of “synchronous stationary clocks located at diﬀerent places”, to enable one to determine

the “time” of a remote event. This requires, however, setting up an inﬁnitude of clocks located all

over “space” and presumably also an inﬁnitude of observers to read these clocks when events occur

at their places.

1.2 Einstein’s “Co-ordinate System” for Space

Einstein assumed the availability of a “system of coordinates” with “the employment of rigid

standards of measurement and the methods of Euclidean geometry”. The most fundamental of

these involve “reaching out” a remote place from an “origin of co-ordinates”. The suggestion that we

might set up a “a three-dimensional scaﬀolding of rigid meter sticks, with clocks for determining the

time of local events situated at the nodal points” 3, or, more picturesquely, “Think of constructing

a frame by assembling meter sticks into a cubical latticework similar to the “jungle gym” seen

on playgrounds. At every intersection of this latticework ﬁx a clock” 4, requires an inﬁnitude of

observers all over space to record the position of an event. Of course, the same observers could

also read the clocks, thereby determining the space co-ordinates and time of occurrence of a remote

event. (In a pre-Einsteinian method of place determination using the latticework, one would see

a particle passing by a particular point on the latticework at a particular time in his watch, and

then later on, go and check the co-ordinates of that point.) In his 2, Einstein says: (p.6)“If, for

instance, a cloud is hovering over Trafalgar Square, then we can determine its position relative to

the surface of the earth by erecting a pole perpendicularly on the Square, so that it reaches the

cloud. ” . . . (p.7) “We speak of the height of the cloud even when the pole which reaches the cloud

has not been erected. By means of optical observations of the cloud from diﬀerent positions on the

ground, and taking into account the properties of the propagation of light, we determine the length

of the pole we should have required in order to reach the cloud.”

1.3

Einstein’s Approach and the “Radar Approach”: Many Clocks or One

Clock?

Einstein’s method of setting up synchronous clocks appears to be very similar to the so-called

“radar” approach. Inspired by the acoustic phenomenon of an “echo”, both involve the sending

and receiving of a “signal”. However, Einstein’s purpose in setting up synchronous clocks was

to provide a physically meaningful deﬁnition of the time of occurrence of a remote event. The

radar approach, on the other hand was ﬁrst used for the detection of a remote object, and later,

for ranging - hence, radio detection and ranging. Interestingly, the use of “Hertzian waves” for

ranging was already envisaged by Nikola Tesla 5 (pp. 208-209) in 1900 : “Stationary waves in the

earth mean something more than mere telegraphy without wires to any distance. ... For instance,

by their use we may produce at will, from a sending-station, an electrical eﬀect in any particular

region of the globe; we may determine the relative position or course of a moving object, such as

a vessel at sea, the distance traversed by the same, or its speed . . . ”. Soon thereafter, on April

30, 1904, a patent for the use of “Hertzian” waves for detection of a remote object was granted

to Christian H¨ulsmeyer. (Of course, using radar, one can also determine “time at a distance”,

although, in practical applications, the distance is more crucial since the time is virtually that of

the observation.) Unlike Einstein’s approach, the radar approach requires only a single observer

using only a single clock. Perhaps, Einstein was not aware of these developments. Or, if he was,

he did not consider them in his study.

In fact, Einstein did not use the idea of signaling as a

means of determining the time of occurrence of a remote event since he assumed that the network

of synchronous clocks had already been set up all over space. (In 1905, transmission and reception

of electromagnetic waves was not a state-of-the-art task. In 2005, it is a commonplace.) Of course,

setting up a synchronous clock or checking the synchronicity of clocks does require an echo.

Would it not be possible, using radar, not only to determine the distance and time of a remote

event, but also to set up a co-ordinate system? If a directional antenna is used, the direction towards

the remote object (line of sight) can also be determined by setting up three “ﬁxed” “reference”

directions or lines of sight, measuring angles, calculating direction cosines, etc. (In fact, it was this

requirement that gave rise to the “three reﬂecting stations” idea of the present paper.) However,

books on the Special Theory of Relativity which mention the radar approach have not spelt out

the operational details of determination of place of the event, except in the case of one-dimensional

motion in the context of another (moving) observer (for example, the “k-calculus” of Bondi 6). Also,

when the observing radar is mounted on a “moving platform”, such as an aircraft, a ship or a land

vehicle, the calculations are usually done without making relativistic correction.

3

In the present paper, we show how, using only a single clock, a single “stationary” observer

could deﬁne a co-ordinate system. What we mean is that a set of appropriate time observations

made with a single clock may be related to or represented by points in 3-dimensional Euclidean

geometry, a concept acquired through “rigid standards of measurements”, or by triples of real

numbers, a more abstract concept. In this sense we could talk of completing Einstein’s kinematics.

1.4 The GPS Approach for Time and Co-ordinate Determination

There is also the practical method of location used in “Global Positioning System”(GPS) 7. It is

based on the use of spatially separated synchronized clocks located in GPS SVs (Space Vehicles),

a la Einstein. But peculiarly enough, in its use, instead of an observer determining the position

and time of a remote event, we have an observer (GPS receiver) determining one’s own location

relative to some speciﬁc locations (the master control station and the monitor stations). It is not

clear how a GPS could be used by a terrestrial observer to determine the position of a terrestrial or

non-terrestrial event. GPS does not involve any echo measurements between SVs and the receiver.

Our approach does have some similarity with the radar and GPS approaches, but we use it to

deﬁne a co-ordinate system and also to study, like Einstein, the relationship between observations

by two observers. The GPS method presumes a co-ordinate system but does make correction for

relativistic eﬀects (time dilatation and gravity).

1.5 Can We Do without an Echo?

If the single observer could be “assisted” by three “reﬂecting stations” or “repeater stations”, then

by measuring the time-diﬀerences between the various signals, direct and indirect, from a remote

object, could the observer determine the place and time of the object? We show below that it is

almost possible to do so - almost, because in theory there are situations where a bivalent ambiguity

may arise, i.e., two diﬀerent determinations are possible for given data. (We give an example of

this in Sec. 3.4.3) One would think that an additional reﬂecting station could be used to resolve

the ambiguity, but it turns out that not even ﬁnitely many additional reﬂecting stations would be

able to resolve all possible ambiguities. However, if we allow the single observer to obtain an echo

from a remote event, then with the help of the three reﬂecting stations, the place and time of the

remote event can be uniquely determined. (An echo involves sending and receiving of a “signal”.

Note that for “non-luminous” objects, we would anyway need the echo approach, so well used by

bats. Thus a signal sent by the observer to the non-luminous object is reﬂected back directly to

the observer by the remote object, but it is also reﬂected by the latter to the three stations which,

4

in turn, reﬂect it to the observer.) We emphasize that the time recording needs to be done only at

one place, thus requiring only one clock, instead of an inﬁnitude of synchronous clocks. The other

stations serve merely to reﬂect the signal sent by the remote object.

1.6 What Is an “Observer”?

It would be correct to say that Einstein was the ﬁrst to take seriously the concept of an “observer”.

Before his 1905 paper, there was, of course, talk of two “co-ordinate systems” or “reference frames”.

But even when talking about the “Galilean transformation of co-ordinates” given by x′(t) = x(t)

−
vt, y′(t) = y(t), z′(t) = z(t), t′ = t, there was no explicit operational characterization of the two

observers involved therein. There was only one omniscient and omnipresent observer, looking at

diagrams on paper !

2 EINSTEIN’S TWO OBSERVERS

2.1 What is “Place” ?

In his paper, at the outset, Einstein emphasized that the notion of “time” in describing “motion”

was not quite clear and needed a deﬁnition. To this, we would like to add that even the notion

of “place” is not clear and needs a deﬁnition. Since this is a matter of deﬁnition, in our proposed

deﬁnition, the question as to whether the set of stations, one of which will serve as an observer, are

at rest or are moving together does not arise. (Synge 8 goes so far as to say: “Suppose that the event

is the explosion of a rocket in mid-air. Let there be four observers, ﬂying about in aeroplanes, not on

any particular courses, but turning and diving and climbing in an arbitrary way. Let each observer

carry a clock, not necessarily an accurate clock but perhaps an old battered clock - the one essential

is that it keeps going. Each observer notes the reading of his clock when he hears the explosion

of the rocket. Let these four readings be denoted by (x1, x2, x3, x4); these four numbers may be

taken as the coordinates of the event”.) Of course, we do specify some observable requirements of

the set of stations. Further, following Einstein, we do consider also the possibility of another set of

stations, and thus, of deﬁning a diﬀerent “time and space” for remote events in exactly the same

way as the ﬁrst one. Naturally, the results of the observations by the two systems cannot be related

unless one ﬁnds out or assumes exactly how the two systems themselves are related. Thus, like

Einstein, one may assume that the second system is moving uniformly relative to the ﬁrst one. In

addition, one needs to make some assumptions about the behaviour of the signals themselves. One

of these is what Einstein calls a “postulate”, namely, that “light is always propagated in empty

5

space with a deﬁnite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body”.

His other postulate, which he called the “Principle of Relativity”, is that “to the ﬁrst order of small

quantities, the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference

for which the equations of mechanics hold good”. (But, in a later section of 1 Einstein states the

Principle of Relativity as follows. “The laws by which the states of physical systems undergo

change are not aﬀected, whether these changes of state be referred to the one or the other of two

systems of co-ordinates in uniform translatory motion”.) Since we are looking at only kinematical

considerations, we assume that the second system of observation and calculation be only similar

to the ﬁrst one in its operational aspects and do not consider laws of mechanics, leave alone laws

of electrodynamics and optics, except towards the end of the present paper (Sec. 6.9). Einstein

assumed the notion of a co-ordinate system for space and so said: “Let us in “stationary” space

take two systems of co-ordinates, i.e., two systems, each of three rigid material lines, perpendicular

to one another, and issuing from a point” without operationally specifying the meaning of “rigid”.

When talking about “another system in uniform motion of translation relatively to the former”

he said: “Now to the origin of one of the two systems (k) let a constant velocity v be imparted

in the direction of the increasing x of the other stationary system (K), and let this velocity be

communicated to the axes of the co-ordinates, the relevant measuring-rod, and the clocks”. In our

approach, we simply assume that we have one system somehow given or set up, and that we have

another system somehow set up which the observer of the ﬁrst system ﬁnds out, on the basis of

observations, to be in uniform motion - “relative” to it, of course. (If the other observer is another

radar, then that has to have its own set of reference directions. We have not seen any discussion,

involving relativistic considerations, of the same object being sighted simultaneously by two radars,

not stationary relative to one another.)

2.2 What is “the same Event”?

Of course, as Bridgman has remarked, the concept of the “same event” being observed by two

systems of observation is not operationally clear, and lurking behind it may be the idea of “absolute

time and space”. Thus, one talks about a “lightning ﬂash” as an event, but how do the two systems

of observers know that they are observing the same event to which they assign perhaps diﬀerent

times and places? Perhaps, a “collision of two particles” or the “onset of a lunar eclipse” are the

sort of event about which two observers may agree that they are observing the “same” event.

Einstein tacitly assumes that there must be some deﬁnite relations between the ﬁndings of the

two observers : “To any system of values x, y, z, t, which completely deﬁnes the place and time of

6

an event in the stationary system, there belongs a system of values ξ, η, ζ, τ , determining that event

relatively to the system k . . . ”. Whether or not one should assume the same constant “velocity” of

the signal (light) c in the diﬀerent systems is perhaps a matter of choice, although Einstein deduces

“as required by the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light, in combination with the

principle of relativity” that “light is also propagated with velocity c when measured in the moving

system”. We feel that the velocity of light is not a Law of Physics; it could be considered to be a

“parameter”.

3 SOME (PHILOSOPHICAL) CLARIFICATIONS

3.1 Are the Considerations here Based on some “Philosophy” of Time?

We assume a minimum, commonsensical, philosophy of time, namely, that human beings have

experiences of “moment” (“at”, “when”), duration (“while”, “during”) and tense (present, past,

future), and that they have available some “local” method of observing the time-instant when they

have some (momentary) experience. For example, we may assume an “analogue” clock-face or a

digital display placed “very close” to the eyes of the observer. It could be the “geodesic clock”

of Marzke 9;10;11. Of course, we do not suppose that anything will do under the name of a clock.

Certainly, the entire past history and experience of mankind has contributed to the concept of time

and development of an artifact called a “clock”. Today, we have “atomic clocks” (as in GPS SVs)

which are very “stable” and so will remain in synchronism over a very long duration. For those who

are so inclined, we could say that a time-instant is represented by an element of the set R of real

numbers and that to each momentary experience of an observer, a unique time-instant is assigned.

In principle, one could allow a very crude “clock”- think of Galileo counting his pulse beats, or, a

child reciting the number-words “one”, “two”, “three”, . . . , when playing a game of hide-and-seek.

Interestingly, most authors, when they talk about a clock, think of some repetitive or periodic

process. Synge 8 says (p.14): “To measure time one must use a clock, a mechanism of some sort

in which a certain process is repeated over and over again under the same conditions, as far as

possible. The mechanism may be a pendulum, a balance wheel with a spring, an electric circuit, or

some other oscillating system . . . ”. Such a clock is a discrete one and requires a counter. Instead,

one could think of a capacitor being charged or discharged very slowly through a resistor, or better

still, of the decay of radioactive carbon! Ideally, the process would go on forever.

7

3.2 Are the Considerations Based on some “Philosophy” of Space ?

Again, we assume a minimum, commonsensical, philosophy of space, namely, that human beings

have experiences of place (“at”, “here”, “there”) and distance (“near”, “far”) through the various

senses such as sight, hearing, and touch, and also through their own mobility. We also realize that

mankind has developed methods of determination of distance and position, such as by stretching

a rope or a cord or the chain of a surveyor, using a “rigid” rod, sighting through a surveyor’s

“level” or a theodolite, measuring parallax, etc. But in our approach we take the view that the

basic observations to be made are only of the time of transmission and reception of “signals” by

only one observer. We show that it may be possible to represent these by points in 3-dimensional

Euclidean geometry, or, more abstractly, by triples of real numbers, i.e., by elements of the set R3,

or, even more abstractly, by elements of an inner product space. This representation, possible in

inﬁnitely many diﬀerent ways, may be called “co-ordinatization” of the events, or “setting up a

co-ordinate system”. To repeat, we assume that what is observed and recorded is an experience of

time; what is deﬁned and calculated is a representation in a manner which is certainly inﬂuenced

by our experience of space. We are certainly not entertaining any conception of a “space-time

continuum” or of “spacetime”. Rather than consider time as a fourth dimension of space, we prefer

to consider space - as far as our representation is concerned - as three additional dimensions of time!

We do have experiences of seeing remote “objects” such as a ﬂying aircraft, the moon, and even

galaxies, which cannot be reached by stretching a cord, or by laying out repeatedly a rigid rod, or

by moving out to the object. Yet we seem to want to extend our concepts of place and distance,

based on stretched cords, rigid rods and moving from one place to another, to these remote objects.

We show how this can be done.

Interestingly, in 2 (p.9) Einstein wrote: “In the ﬁrst place we entirely shun the vague word

“space”, of which, we must honestly acknowledge, we cannot form the slightest conception, and we

replace it by “motion relative to a practically rigid body of reference” ”. However, in 1, when deriving

the “transformation of co-ordinates and times”, he appealed to “the properties of homogeneity

which we attribute to space and time”.

3.3 Are the Considerations Based on some “Philosophy” of Light (as a Signal)?

With Einstein, we do say that light “travels” from one “place” at one “time” to another “place”

at another “time” with a constant “velocity” irrespective of what body emits the light and what

observer, or system of observations, is used to receive the signal. Of course, in our view, what is

observed is only the transmission and reception of the signal at the time shown by the clock. The

8

other times and places of the signal are only inferred, i.e., deﬁned and calculated. Thus, in our

proposal, the observer receives four signals, emitted by an object - we are tempted to say, at some

place and time - one of them coming directly to the observer from the emitting object, and the

other three, after reﬂection at three stations. Einstein calls them “light signals” or “light stimuli” 2.

We could think of them as ﬂashes or pulses of light, or even as “light particles”.

Unlike Einstein, however, we do not assume that velocity of light has been ascertained by

experiment to be such and such, because that will involve previous determination of both time and

space. Rather, we take velocity as a mere constant that enables us to deﬁne distance in terms of

time, much like the astronomical way of using light-years. Indeed, we could even take the “velocity”

to be unity so that the distance traveled by a light ray is just another name for the duration of its

travel. A distance for us is basically associated with the time of “travel” of light.

3.4 Are the Considerations Based on some “Philosophy” of Geometry?

Speciﬁcally, are we assuming some “geometry” of “space”? For example, are we assuming the

geometry of space to be “Euclidean” and 3-dimensional? What we shall use is a simple kind of

“distance” or “metric” geometry 12 wherein we have “points” and “distances between them” - which

are non-negative real numbers - satisfying the usual “metric space” axioms, in particular, the “tri-

angle inequality”. So it seems that the “geometry” of an inner product space is adequate. However,

as we have emphasized, the choice of a “geometry” for space is only a choice of representation.

First, we need certain extensions to 3-dimensional or “solid” geometry of some Euclidean results

in 2-dimensional or “plane” geometry.

3.4.1 Results from 2-dimensional or “plane” Geometry: Triangle Inequalities

Euclid’s “Elements” I.20 states : “In any triangle, two sides taken together in any manner are

greater than the remaining one.” (Hence the term “triangle inequality”.)

Then, I.22: “Out of three straight lines, which are equal to three given straight lines, to construct

a triangle: thus it is necessary that two of the three (given) straight lines taken together in any

manner should be greater than the remaining one.” (It is enough to check that the longest of the

three lines is less than the other two lines taken together.)

To construct the triangle, Euclid has to draw or construct some circles.

If the construction

takes place in a plane, then there are two triangles that satisfy the requirement (with diﬀering

“orientation”). What Euclid shows is that we can “locate” three points A, B, C, in a plane such

that the lines joining them, AB, BC, CA, are “equal” to the three given lines. After joining the

9

points (vertices), a triangle is obtained (with sides in addition to the vertices). If not all the triangles

inequalities are satisﬁed, there may no such triangle, or the triangle may be a “degenerate” one,

with A, B, C being collinear.

We can show easily that any (non-degenerate) triangle can be co-ordinatized, i.e., represented,

non-uniquely in R2. (We say R2 and not “a plane”, because this can be done without assuming

that the triangle “lies” in a plane.) If ABC is the triangle, represent A by (0,0), B by (AB, 0) and C

by (x, y), with x, y chosen suitably, in two diﬀerent ways. Of course, this is only one representation

and assumes a deﬁnition of “distance” in R2. Such a co-ordinatization can be given a familiar visual

meaning : choose in a “plane” the point A as the origin of co-ordinates, any line X′AX through A

and B as the x-axis and a line Y′AY perpendicular to the x-axis as the y-axis.

We point out the following abstract, metric-space counterpart of I.22 and representation in

R2.

}

If

is a set on which there is a metric ρ then there is a representing function φ:

A, B, C
{
R2 such that ρ(A, B) = de(φ(A), φ(B)), where de denotes the “Euclidean” distance in
A, B, C
{
R2. Brieﬂy, a metric space with three elements can be “embedded” in R2. Note that it may be

} →

possible to embed it in R, corresponding to the geometric situation when A, B, C are collinear.

Instead of R2, we could use a two-dimensional inner-product space.

3.4.2 Extension to 3-dimensional or “solid” Geometry: Tetrahedral Inequalities

We need the extension of the above two Euclidean propositions to solid geometry, speciﬁcally, for

a tetrahedron, i.e., a problem with six lines (and four points). Obviously, in any tetrahedron, the

three sides of each face of the tetrahedron have to satisfy I.20. But what about the counterpart of

I.22? It seems that there is a partial counterpart to this. (We have not seen this result stated as a

theorem in axiomatic treatments of solid geometry.)

Partial Counterpart: Given six straight lines, suppose that some three of them satisfy I.22 and

thus can be made into a triangle, say, ABC. If the remaining three straight lines satisfy appropriate

inequalities, then a tetrahedron can be erected on triangle ABC such that these remaining straight

lines are equal to the three edges of the tetrahedron other than those of the base ABC. Thus,

denoting the would-be vertex by D, we have three additional triangles DAB, DBC, DCA, and so

with some choice of the three remaining straight lines as the “proposed” edges DA, DB, DC, the

appropriate triangle inequalities must be satisﬁed for the “proposed” faces DAB, DBC, DCA. (To

construct the tetrahedron in space, i.e., to “locate” the fourth vertex, one would need to construct

appropriate spheres and two diﬀerent tetrahedra would result.)

Again, we can show easily that the vertices of any (non-degenerate) tetrahedron can be co-

10

ordinatized, i.e., represented non-uniquely in R3 without visualizing R3 in terms of three co-ordinate

axes . If ABCD is the tetrahedron, represent A by (0, 0, 0), B by (AB, 0, 0), C by (x1, y1, 0) for

suitable non-unique x1, y1, and D by (x2, y2, z2) for suitable non-unique x2, y2, z2. Again, this

is only one possible representation. There is, again a visual meaning that can be given to this

co-ordinatization.

We have the following metric space counterpart : If

is a set on which there is a met-

ric ρ then there is a representing function φ:

R3 such that ρ(A, B) = de(φ(A), φ(B)),
where de denotes the “Euclidean” distance in R3. Brieﬂy, a metric space with four elements can
be “embedded” in R3. Note that it may be possible to embed it in R2, corresponding to the ge-

} →

ometric situation when A, B, C, D are coplanar. Instead of R3, we could use a three-dimensional

A, B, C, D
}
{
A, B, C, D
{

inner-product space.

3.4.3 Representability of additional Points

The following problem of representability of additional points can arise in the plane, i.e., in R2.

Suppose ABC is a given (non-degenerate) triangle (i.e., suppose three straight lines satisfying the

triangle inequality are given), and we have a representation of it in R2. Suppose a fourth point D is

given, or, rather three more straight lines DA, DB, DC are given, such that the triangle inequalities

are satisﬁed for the triangles DAB, DBC, DCA. Is D representable in R2? (Equivalently, is D

coplanar with ABC?) The answer is, of course, that D is not necessarily representable in R2, since

a point D can be chosen which is not coplanar with A, B, C. (This is an axiom of “solid” geometry.)

If D is representable, its representation is unique. The metric space counterpart of this is that a

four-element metric space may not be embeddable in R2.

Now consider the counterpart of this in solid geometry. Suppose a (non-degenerate) tetrahedron

DABC is given and which is, therefore, representable in R3. Suppose a ﬁfth point E is given and

four more straight lines are given which are to be the sides EA, EB, EC, ED. Is the point E co-

ordinatizable, i.e., representable in R3? Obviously, these new straight lines must satisfy the triangle

inequalities for the new triangles that are to be formed. But are these inequalities suﬃcient to

guarantee the representability of E as a point of 3-dimensional space? If not, one would have to

say that the point E is not representable in R3, i.e., in 3-dimensional space, and so, one could

look for representability in R4. Thus, a ﬁve-element metric space of which a four element subset is

embeddable in R3 may not be embeddable in R3.

To construct a counterexample for representability in R3, we go to a fourth dimension and

choose ﬁve appropriate 4-tuples in R4 such that four of them form a tetrahedron, and so, this

11

tetrahedron can be represented in R3. But the ﬁfth “point” cannot be represented in R3. (Coun-

terexample 1: choose the 4-tuples as follows. A:(0, 0, 0, 0), B:(1, 0, 0, 0), C:(0, 1, 0, 0), D:(0, 0, 1, 0),

E:(0, 0, 0, a), with a

= 0 . The various distances are: AB = AC = AD = 1, AE = a, BC =

BD = CD = √2, BE = CE = DE = √a2 + 1. The triangle inequalities are satisﬁed for all

the triangles, namely, ABC, ABD, etc. Now, A, B, C, D can obviously be represented in R3 as

(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1) respectively, but with this representation we show that E cannot

be represented in R3. We have BE2 = AB2 + AE2, so AB is perpendicular to AE in R3, as are also

AC, AD, which is not possible in R3.) If, however, instead of four straight lines or lengths EA, EB,

EC, ED, three diﬀerences in lengths, say, EB - EA, EC - EA, ED - EA are speciﬁed such that these

satisfy appropriate triangle inequalities, then the problem has a (non-unique) solution. (We give an

example of non-uniqueness. Counterexample 2: let A be (0, 0, 0), B:(1, 0, 0), C:(0, 1, 0), D:(0, 0, 1),

We note that in our approach the co-ordinatization or representation is not any “intrinsic”

property of “space” and we are not assuming that space “has” a particular “metric”. We are

simply choosing a representation which is convenient (and familiar)!

4 THE NEW APPROACH

In the new approach proposed here for the deﬁnition and calculation of both time and space co-

ordinates, we assume a system S consisting of one observer s0 with a clock and three reﬂecting

“stations” s1, s2, s3. (Einstein used the letter K to denote what he called a “stationary” system

and letter k to denote another “moving” system. We will use the corresponding Greek letter Σ

to denote the other observation system.) Suppose the observer s0 observes four time-instants in

his clock: one, t0, of direct reception of a signal emitted by a distant object P when something

happens; another,a time instant t1 of reception of a signal via, i.e., after reﬂection at, s1, and

similarly, instants t2, t3. (Thus, this may correspond to s0 “seeing” a ﬂash “directly” at time t0,

and then seeing images of the “same” ﬂash in the “mirrors” at s1, s2, s3 at instants t1, t2, t3.) How

shall we deﬁne the place and time of occurrence of this event?

It cannot be overemphasized that we are trying to propose a deﬁnition of the space co-ordinates

and time of an arbitrary event on the basis of observed time instants t0, t1, t2, t3. Of course, we do

not want to do this arbitrarily. (With complete arbitrariness, as mentioned by Synge 8, there may

not be much that we can say.) In particular, we do hope that the proposed deﬁnition will corre-

spond, when feasible, to the classical deﬁnition achieved with “the employment of rigid standards

12

6

of measurements and the methods of Euclidean geometry”. So, we look for a co-ordinatization or

representation in R3 (and a little more generally, in a three dimensional inner-product space, say L,

over R) of the “space” aspect of an event, and in R of the “time” aspect of the event. Further, we

do not want the reﬂecting stations s1, s2, s3 to “behave” in any arbitrary manner. We, therefore,

assume that the four stations s0, s1, s2, s3 form a “rigid” system as evidenced observationally.

Thus, we assume that by using the “echo” method, the observer s0 ascertains that the three sta-

tions are at a constant delay from s0 and from one another - recall that for us, a distance is a

time-diﬀerence. We assume that the delays between the reﬂecting stations are symmetric, i.e., the

delay from s1 to s2, say, is equal to the delay from s2 to s1, and so on. Let these one-way time

delays between s0 and s1, s2, s3 be denoted by d1, d2, d3, and the time delay between s1 and s2,

ascertained indirectly, by d12, etc. We assume that the stations form a non-degenerate tetrahedron,

and that the appropriate triangle inequalities are satisﬁed. (Of course, this can be veriﬁed knowing

the distances d1, etc., and d12, etc., and we expect this to happen because of our beliefs that light

takes the shortest path between two points, and that the shortest path between two points is a

straight line.)

The observer now postulates that the signal was emitted by the remote object at some (un-

known) “time” t, and thus traveled from the object at time t to the observer at time t0, with t0 ≥
and thus the “distance” between P and s0 is (t0 −
expressing distance in terms of “light-time”. Similarly, the signal sent by P at time t must have

t), choosing the velocity of light as “1” i.e.,

t,

reached the reﬂecting station s1 at time (t1 −
s1, it reached s0 at time (t1 −
Likewise for the signals received from the other stations. Note that we have to honestly admit that

t, so that after reﬂection at

t).

≥

the observer at s0 cannot “see” the signal (light ray or light particle) leaving P and arriving at his

own place; he imagines or assumes the signal to “leave” and “arrive”, but, of course, he does see

it at his own place. Similarly, s0 does not see the signal leaving at a remote place P at one time,

arriving at the remote reﬂecting station s1, say, at another time, getting reﬂected instantaneously

and arriving at his own place. So, what we are assuming is that if we imagine (assume) a light

signal to leave “place” P at ”time” tP and to arrive directly at “place” Q at ”time” tQ, then the

“distance” between P and Q shall equal the duration between tP and tQ (“velocity” of light = 1).

At this stage, we are not assuming any speciﬁc “path” for the signal between P and Q. There are,

of course, practical problems that may arise. One may not be able to receive a particular signal at

all - one will then ascribe it to an “obstruction”.

Now, knowing the “distances” d1, d2, d3, and d12, d13, d23, we can co-ordinatize, i.e., represent,

13

these stations s0, s1, s2, s3 non-uniquely in R3. In particular we may represent s0 by the origin

(0, 0, 0) of the co-ordinate system. One could also represent them by vectors in a 3-dimensional

inner product space, say L, and thus, in particular, s0 by the zero vector of the vector space. (In

1905, physicists were not very familiar with the concept of an abstract inner product space. Even

mathematicians were only beginning to get to know it. However, physicists were familiar with

the concept of n-dimensional Euclidean space.) We will use this abstract representation in our

derivations below because, today, physicists are quite familar with the concept of an abstract inner

product space. We will denote the representations of the stations s0, etc., in L by the same symbols

in boldface, s0, etc. The fact that the four stations form a non-degenerate tetrahedron implies that

the three vectors s1, s2, s3 form a basis for L, with s0 = 0.

The problem then would be to determine the representation p in L of the space aspect of the

event P (the co-ordinate triple (x, y, z) if L is R3), and the unknown time t, from the measured

time instants t0, t1, t2, t3. That is, we have to determine a vector p, and a number t (or, equally

well, the number (t0 −

t) ) such that

(A similar set of equations arises in GPS, except that usually one ﬁnds it stated that only three

distances are enough. But this is because the GPS receiver is known to be on one particular side

of the triangle formed by the three SVs.) Would the determined time t and the norm

depend

p

||

||

on the choice of the space L and on the embedding of the stations in L ? Indeed, we will show that

they do not. (Recall that the station s0 is represented by the zero vector of the vector space L.)

We assume that these time instants ti satisfy certain additional inequalities, other than the

obvious ones given above, which follow from the triangle inequalities for the various triangles formed

by P and the four stations. Thus, for example, for the triangle Ps0s1 we have Ps1 + s1s0 ≥
that

Ps0 so

(t1 −

As remarked in Sec. 3.4 above, this problem may not have a solution - unless we believe, with

Einstein, that “space” is 3-dimensional. If it does not have a solution, either we could say that

“space” is not 3-dimensional, or we could say that the paths of the light particles may not be

straight lines - perhaps because of the eﬀect of gravity (but why not of an electromagnetic ﬁeld?).

(In our approach, we could also think of setting up one more reﬂecting station. Only experience

can show whether that will suﬃce to represent the observations we actually make! Our calculations

below can be easily extended to handle more that three reﬂecting stations.) Assuming that it has a

solution, we show that it will have two solutions, and we will have to choose the one which satisﬁes

the inequalities such as (t0 −

t)

0 and others above.

Since

the solution d (and, therefore, t in Eqs. (1)),

From Eq. (8) we get :

[aT (Gs)−

1]d2 + 2[bT (Gs)−

1a]d + bT (Gs)−

1b = 0.

−

The coeﬃcients of the above quadratic equation are determined solely by the delays di, dij, and do

not depend on the representation. So, if Eq. (12) has a solution d > 0, our supposition that the

signal left P at some time t and arrived at s0 at the later observed time t0 is a possible one. Note

that Eq. (12) is only a consequence of Eqs. (1) and not equivalent to it. Therefore, it does not

follow that a solution of Eq. (12) will be a solution of Eqs. (1). Since the matrix Gs is positive

deﬁnite, the constant term in the quadratic is positive if b

= 0. (If b = 0, then Eq. (12) becomes

trivial.)

Now, in principle, the following cases arise.

negative, and so we obtain a unique positive solution of Eq. (12). Of course, this positive solution

may not give a t, and p such that Eqs. (1) is satisﬁed. (Using counterexample 1 in Sec. 3.4, with

A, B, C, D chosen as s0, s1, s2, s3, E as P, with a = 1.5, d1 = d2 = d3 = 1, d12 = d23 = d31 = √2,

Case III : If [aT (Gs)−

Case III(a) : Eq. (12) may have complex solutions in which case Eqs. (1) has no solutions

(counterexample 1 with the following changes: A:(0, 0, 0, 0), B:(√2.61, 0, 0, 0), C:(0, √2.61, 0, 0),

D:(0, 0, √0.99, 0), E:(0, 0, √0.99, 0.1), EA = 1, EB = EC = 1.9, ED = 0.1.)

Case III(b) : If the solutions of Eq. (12) are real and both negative (counterexample 1 with

a

≤

√3

), then again Eqs. (1) has no solution.

Case III(c) : Finally, in the third case, Eq.

(12) may have two unequal positive solutions.

(Counterexample 2 in Sec. 3.4 gives rise to this case.) It is because of this ambiguity, which cannot

be resolved in general by using ﬁnitely many additional reﬂecting stations, that we may have to

use an echo from the remote object. Thus, the observer would send a signal at time t′0, say, to ﬁnd

out that its echo arrives at the same instant t0 at which the signal possibly generated by the event

also arrives and so the time t of the event is immediately determined, “by deﬁnition”, as Einstein

says, to be

t =

(t′0 + t0).

1
2

In that case, t in Eqs. (1) is known, and the vector p can be uniquely determined from Eq. (10)

itself, provided a solution exists, without going to the quadratic equation. However, it may not be

a solution of Eqs. (1). It is necessary to check that this solution p satisﬁes the ﬁrst equation in

Eqs. (1), namely,

t. Henceforth, we will assume that the observer does obtain an echo

p

||

||

= t0 −

from the remote object, i.e., the observer sends a signal at time t′0 and receives it at time t0.

We have thus shown that the time of occurrence and place (co-ordinates) of a remote event

may be deﬁned and determined by one observer with one clock, with the help of three reﬂecting

stations. These observations involve only transmission of signals by the observer and reception of

signals, direct and indirect from the remote event by the observer. We assume that the observer

17

ascertains through various “echo” measurements that the “distances” between the stations remain

constant. We next turn to the possibility of envisaging another observer and system of observation.

5 ANOTHER OBSERVER

Like Einstein, we now consider the possibility of another observer, or observation system, exactly

like the one in the previous section. This second system Σ will thus consist of an observer σ0, with

his own clock, and three reﬂecting stations σ1, σ2, σ3. Σ can also be allowed to assume that the

“velocity” of the signal is “1” but this is a matter of choice. We do choose it to be 1. We will assume

that, like the ﬁrst observer, by “echo” experiments, σ0 can ascertain that the distances between

the various stations do not change with (σ0’s) time. Let these distances (and delays) as observed

by Σ be denoted by δ1, etc., δ12 etc. We also assume that Σ ﬁnds σ0σ1σ2σ3 to be a non-degenerate

tetrahedron so that σ0 can determine the time of occurrence τ and place (co-ordinates) (ξ, η, ζ) of a

remote event P on the basis of observation times τ ′0 of sending of the signal, and times τ0, τ1, τ2, τ3

of reception of the various echoes. We will ﬁnd it advantageous now to use a vector π in place of a

triple (ξ, η, ζ), and we will assume that π belongs to a 3-dimensional inner product space Λ. Note

that this vector space Λ need not be the same as the vector space L of the ﬁrst observer, although

since both of them are 3-dimensional, they are isomorphic to one another. Let Σ assign the zero

vector in Λ to σ0 and vectors δ1, δ2, δ3 in Λ to σ1, σ2, σ3, so that

5.1 Relation between the “Clocks” of the two Observers

Now, “we” cannot expect to be able to talk about or discover any relation between the determination

t, p by the ﬁrst observer and the determination τ , π by the second observer of the “same” event

P, unless “we” assume or discover some relationship between the systems S and Σ themselves. So,

with Einstein, we assume that Σ has a “uniform motion of translation relatively to” S. This is

something which S (or its observer s0) can ascertain experimentally, and results in a description

of the motion of Σ, i.e., of its stations σ0, σ1, σ2, σ3 in S’s system. So let the motions of these be

given by

σ0(t) = σ0 + tv, σi(t) = σ0(t) + di,

(i = 1, 2, 3)

(13)

where σ0(t), σi(t), σ0, di, and v are all vectors, di being the position vector of σi with respect to

σ0 in S and v the common velocity of the stations σ0, σ1, σ2, σ3 in S. (The symbols di, dij will no

longer denote the distances between the stations si of S.)

18

Thus, we assume that S has ascertained experimentally that the stations σ0, σ1, σ2, σ3 of Σ

form a “rigid” system having a common uniform motion of translation relative to S. Now, for Σ to

be able to assign times and co-ordinates to events in the same manner as S does, it is necessary

that these stations form a “rigid” system in Σ, i.e., be at constant Σ-delays from one another and

to form a non-degenerate tetrahedron. Does the rigidity of σ0σ1σ2σ3 in S imply the rigidity of

σ0σ1σ2σ3 in Σ? Unfortunately, the answer to this is “no”. We will see below that even assuming

the rigidity of σ0σ1σ2σ3 in Σ is not enough. However, we do show that assuming the rigidity of

the straight line through σ0 and σ1 in Σ is enough to guarantee the rigidity of σ0σ1σ2σ3 in Σ. In

fact, we show that the assumption that the straight line through σ0 and σ1 is “rigid” in Σ has the

consequence that the Σ-time at σ0 must be a constant multiple of the S-time at σ0. This relation

does hold when x = vt for Einstein’s formula

since with x = vt,

τ = φ(v)β(t

vx/c2)

τ = φ(v)β(1

v2/c2)t.

−

−

Here, φ is Einstein’s “yet unknown” function and β = 1/

1

v2/c2. However, in his derivation,

Einstein uses the assumption that “the equations must be linear on account of the properties of

−

p

homogeneity which we attribute to space and time.” In fact, the linear relation between the Σ-time

τ and S-time t at σ0 follows directly from his assumptions of the linearity of τ as a function of x′,

y, z, t, since at σ0, x′ = y = z = 0.

Consider Fig. 1. (We show a ﬁgure only to help “visualize” the derivations; we are not using

any “geometry” other than that of an inner product space.

Interestingly, there were no ﬁgures

in Einstein’s paper, and no references either. However, he does mention Lorentz in one place:

9
§

“. . . on the basis of our kinematical principles, the electrodynamic foundation of Lorentz’s theory

of the electrodynamics of moving bodies is in agreement with the principle of relativity”.) Fig. 1

shows the “motion” in S of a signal which starts from σ0 at A at some time t, reaches σ1 at B at

some later time (t + ∆′1), and returns to σ0 at C at a still later time (t + ∆′1 + ∆′′1). Here, D is the

position of σ1 at time t, and so AD = d1. E is the position of σ0 at time (t + ∆′1), so EB = d1 also,

and EB is parallel to AD. We have for the vectors AB, AD, DB,

Since

AB

||

||

= ∆′1, we have thus to solve the following equation for ∆′1:

(14)

AB = AD + DB

= d1 + ∆′1v.

d1 + ∆′1v
||

||

= ∆′1 > 0.

19

We will see that such an equation will occur in our later investigations.

“Squaring” Eq. (14), since

AB

= ∆′1, we get:

(15)

Case I : If v2 < 1, i.e., the second observer moves at a speed less than that of light, the product

of the two roots of this quadratic equation is negative; therefore, it has two real roots, one positive

and the other negative. We are assuming a “direction” for time, so ∆′1 ≥
the signal leaving σ0 at time t to reach σ1 at a later time (t + ∆′1), ∆′1 being the positive root of

0. Thus, it is possible for

the quadratic.

Next, for the vectors BC, BE, EC,

BC = BE + EC

d1 + ∆′′1v.

Squaring this equation and using

Since v2 < 1, this quadratic, too, has two real roots, one positive and the other negative, so that

it is possible for the signal leaving σ1 at time t + ∆′1 to reach σ0 at a later time (t + ∆′1 + ∆′′1), ∆′′1

being the positive root of the quadratic.

Thus, if v2 < 1, it is possible for a signal to go from σ0 to σ1 and then to return to σ0, so

that σ0 will be able to “see” σ1. (In fact, it is easy to see that the roots of the two quadratic

equations are negatives of one another, so that the negative root of the ﬁrst quadratic could have

been interpreted as

∆′′1.) So, the “round-trip” time ∆1 is given by

which is independent of the time instant t. We now assume that σ0’s clock shows a Σ-time τ which

is some function φ of the S-time t at σ0:

This is a special case of Einstein’s assumption that “to any system of values x, y, z, t, which

completely deﬁnes the place and time of an event in the stationary system (K), there belongs a

system of values ξ, η, ζ, τ , determining that event relatively to the system k”.

τ = φ(t).

20

Now, according to Σ, σ1 is at a ﬁxed “distance” from σ0, i.e., the round-trip delay from σ0 to

σ1 and back to σ0 is constant. So, for all t,

φ(t + ∆1)

φ(t) = k1,

−

(18)

where k1 is some constant, not of our choosing. What kind of a function can we reasonably assume

φ to be ? Surely, if the second observer’s “recording device” is to deserve the name “clock”, we

expect its time-order to correspond to that of the ﬁrst observer. (Of course, if the time-order of

Σ is just the reverse of that of S, we can just change the sign of its reading to restore the correct

order.) Also, we would expect τ to change if t changes. So, the function φ must be a monotone

increasing function. Further, we can “adjust” the zero-setting of Σ’s clock so that φ(0) = 0.

Now, although the linear function

θ(t) = (k1/∆1)t

does satisfy all these conditions, it is not the only function to do so. Indeed, if we let ψ = φ

θ,

−

we get

ψ(t + ∆1)

ψ(t) = 0, ψ(0) = 0,

−

i.e., that ψ must be a periodic function, with period ∆1. So, we need some additional conditions

on φ to “pin it down”.

We could now invoke the assumption that the other two stations σ2, σ3, which are at a constant

delay from σ0 in S, are also at a constant delay from σ0 in Σ, and thus get two additional conditions

φ(t + ∆2)

φ(t) = k2, φ(t + ∆3)

φ(t) = k3,

−

−

where ∆2, ∆3 are given by expressions similar to the one for ∆1 and k2, k3 are some further

constants, not of our choosing. But, it may happen that, unfortunately, ∆2, ∆3 are both equal to

∆1! Even if they are diﬀerent from ∆1, we only get two more conditions on the periodicity of ψ,

namely that the “undetermined” function ψ must be periodic with periods ∆2, ∆3 also, provided

the constants k2 and k3 are related to k1 “properly”, namely :

k1
∆1

=

=

k2
∆2

k3
∆3

,

which could be interpreted as “isotropy of space”. However, can we conclude from the facts that the

function ψ has three diﬀerent periodicities ∆1, ∆2, ∆3 that ψ must be the zero function? We can if

we assume that at least two of these three periods are not rationally related and that the function

ψ has a unique Fourier series expansion. But what physical signiﬁcance would this assumption

have?

21

A better alternative, which could be interpreted as homogeneity of space in one direction, is

to consider points in S that lie on the inﬁnite straight line through σ0 and σ1 (somewhat like a

co-ordinate axis) and move along with σ0 and σ1, and to assume that each of these lies at a constant

Σ-delay from σ0, proportional to the S-delay from σ0. This assumption, together with the fact that

∆1 is a homogeneous function of d1, would imply that

for every α, so ψ(t) = 0 for all t and thus :

ψ(t + α∆1)

ψ(t) = 0,

−

τ = β1t,

for some “yet unknown constant” β1.

Note that our assumption above is not quite what is usually understood as “rigidity”. Usually,

“rigidity” is assumed to consist in the invariance of distance between points on a moving object

no matter how the object moves. What we have assumed is that points on the σ0-σ1 “axis” which

move along with σ0 and σ1 in S, and, therefore, remain at a constant S-delay from σ0, also remain

at a constant Σ-delay. With this assumption, we do not need to assume that φ is monotone since

for all t and for all α implies

φ(t + α∆1)

φ(t) = αk1,

−

ψ(t + α∆1)

ψ(t) = 0,

−

for all t and for all α; this along with ψ(0) = 0 implies that ψ(t) = 0 for all t.

An advantage of our assumption is that it implies that the stations σ2, σ3, which move with

σ0 and σ1 in S, stay at constant delays from σ0 in Σ. We will show later (Sec. 5.3) that the

stations σi and σj also stay at a constant delay from one another in Σ. So, we need not assume

that σ0σ1σ2σ3 is a non-degenerate tetrahedron in Σ; this will follow from the fact that σ0σ1σ2σ3 is

a non-degenerate tetrahedron in S.

We could now assume that β1 = 1, rather than conclude, with Einstein, that β1 = β =

1/

(1

v2/c2), because at this point, we do not see any dependence of β1, β2 on v. We will

see now that β1 is involved in a relation between the S-distance d1 between σ0 and σ1, and the

Σ-distance δ1 between σ0 and σ1. As seen above, the round-trip S-delay between σ0 and σ1 is

∆1 and so the round-trip Σ-delay between σ0 and σ1 will be β1∆1, and this must equal twice the

Σ-distance δ1 between σ0 and σ1; so 2δ1 = β1∆1 and thus

to σ0 and the transition time (in Σ) δ1 from σ1 to σ0. We will have similar expressions for δ2 and

δ3. So, if δ1, δ2, δ3 are vectors in Λ which represent σ1, σ2, σ3 in Σ, they must be chosen such that

δi

= δi.

Case II : What would happen if v2 > 1, i.e., the second observer travels faster than light? The

roots of Eq. (15) and Eq. (16) are real only if

1, and under that condition,

since their product is positive, the roots are either both positive or both negative.

If, further,

(d1

·

the other hand, if (d1

v) < 0, then the roots of Eq. (16) are both negative. Thus, a signal from σ1

cannot reach σ0. Therefore, in either case σ0 cannot see σ1! We will comment on the signiﬁcance

of this situation in Sec. 6.3.

Case III : If v2 = 1, i.e., the second observer travels at the speed of light, only one of Eq. (15)

and Eq. (16) has a positive solution. So, either σ0 will not see σ1 or σ1 will not see σ0.

5.2 Relation between the “Times” of a remote Event Determined by the two

Observers

Now we proceed to show that indeed π and τ are related to p and t, and that the relations are

linear. We do not have to assume like Einstein that “the equations must be linear on account of

the properties of homogeneity which we attribute to space and time”. We have already derived

above the linearity of the relation between the S-times and Σ-times at σ0. We show that τ and t

are also linearly related.

As remarked above, we will use a vectorial representation and we emphasize that that the two

vector spaces used by S and Σ, namely, L and Λ, need not be identical. We also ﬁnd it advantageous

to work with the “relative” position of P, relative to σ0 in S, namely

¯p = p

σ0(t),

−

and thus investigate a possible relationship between ¯p, t and π, τ .

Firstly, suppose that a signal leaves P, with co-ordinate vector p (in S), at time t (in S) and

arrives, at some time t0 (in S), at σ0, with co-ordinate vector σ0(t0) (in S). (See Fig. 2.) Then we

(20)

(21)

must have :

But from Eq. (13), we have:

p

||

−

σ0(t0)

= t0 −

t.

σ0(t0) = σ0(t) + (t0 −

t)v,

23

so that,

This equation is like Eq. (14). So analogous to Eq. (15), we obtain :

Note that the solution of Eq. (21) for the unknown t0 (and of the equation with (t

t′0) in place

−

t) in Eq. (21), for the unknown t′0) is relatively easy and explicit when the second observer

of (t0 −
σ0 has a uniform motion, as here. When the motion of σ0 is not uniform, the solution may be a

substantial problem. The solution may not exist, as is the case here if v2

1.

≥

Now, with v2 < 1, this quadratic equation for (t0 −

t) will have two real solutions, one positive

and the other negative (because the product of the two roots is negative.) The positive root (t0 −
(and so with t0 > t) gives the time of arrival at σ0 of the signal from P, whereas the negative root

t)

t) (and so with t′0 < t) gives the time of departure from σ0 of a signal of which the received

(t′0 −
signal could well have been an echo from P. (If v2

1, then σ0 will not “see” P. This is similar to

≥

the situation with regard to σ1 discussed above.) The sum of the two roots of the quadratic is

and so we obtain

giving

v2).

But then β1t0 and β1t′0 would be the Σ-times of arrival and departure from σ0 of the signal to P,

and so we have immediately the time τ assigned by Σ to P as

τ = β1[ 1

2 (t0 + t′0)]

= β1t

γ ( ¯p

v).

−

·

(24)

Note that essentially what we have derived in this sub-section is a formula for the time t′0 in S of

the departure of the signal from the station σ0 to the observed event (p, t) and the time t0 in S of

the arrival of this signal at σ0. Note also that in this derivation, we have not made any assumption

about the speed of light in the moving systems Σ.

Now, in Σ, the same signal (see Fig. 2) leaves from an (unknown) place π at the Σ-time τ that we

We can similarly obtain two more equations:

Since σ0σ1σ2σ3 is a non-degenerate tetrahedron in Σ, the vectors δ1, δ2, δ3 are linearly inde-

pendent, so form a basis for Λ, and so π is a linear combination of δ1, δ2, δ3. This, alongwith

Eq. (32), Eq. (33), Eq. (34) implies that there must be a linear transformation T from the vector

space L to the vector space Λ:

such that

Thus, we have proved that π and τ are linearly related to ¯p, the relation being independent of t.

The transformation T can be calculated from Eq. (32), Eq. (33), Eq. (34), but knowing that such a

transformation exists, we can take a short-cut. Indeed, choose P to be σ1 itself in S. Then, ¯p = d1.

But σ1 is δ1 in Σ. So we have

Similarly,

T (d2) = δ2,

T (d3) = δ3.

(37)

(38)

From this, it follows that the transformation T is one-to-one.

Now, this co-ordinatization in Σ involves choosing the representing vectors δ1, δ2, δ3 in Λ.

They cannot be chosen arbitrarily, however, because we have the equations

obtained earlier. Moreover, by considering signals traveling between, say, σ1 and σ2 in S and in

Σ, we get additional relations for the norms of the vectors δ12, δ23 and δ31, these vectors forming

the remaining three sides of the tetrahedron σ0σ1σ2σ3 in Σ. We can calculate the Σ-distance δ12

between σ1 and σ2 as follows (see Fig. 4).

Consider a round-trip from σ0 to σ1 to σ2 back to σ0, starting at σ0 at A at S-time t. This

signal will reach σ1 at B at S-time

therefore, their norms, which are equal to the delays δ1, δ2 and δ12, satisfy triangle inequalities.

What we have shown above is that the six sides of the tetrahedron σ0σ1σ2σ3 in Σ can be

calculated from the six sides of the tetrahedron in S and the vectors σ1, σ2, σ3, and the velocity

vector v in S. As remarked in Sec. 3.4, the tetrahedron in Σ can be co-ordinatized or represented by

vectors in the inner-product space Λ non-uniquely. Note that the tetrahedron σ0σ1σ2σ3 moves in

S but it remains rigid and has a translatory motion. The transformation T that maps the position

of the remote event relative to σ0 in S into the position of that event relative to σ0 in Σ is the one

that maps the relative position vector σ1

σ0, namely, d1, in L into the vector δ1 in Λ, and so on.

−

What about description of motion in S and Σ? To be able to deﬁne velocity and acceleration,

the geometry of an inner-product space suﬃces. But we do not develop this here.

5.4 Theory and Practice of Observers

5.4.1 Could the reﬂecting stations “move”?

It is perhaps too “theoretical” or “idealistic” to assume that the distances between the various

stations remain constant. To be “practical”, one should consider the possibility of these distances

(delays, really) varying with s0’s time (or σ0’s time). In such a case, the lengths of the sides of

the tetrahedron s0s1s2s3 will change with time. But what do we mean here by “the sides of the

tetrahedron at any instant of time”? We had assumed that the observer, with his clock at s0,

ﬁnds out by various echo measurements that the delays between the stations remain constant. This

allowed us to deﬁne the various distances between the stations. Now, if the delays do not remain

constant, then we can still give meaning to the distance between, say, s0 and s1, at each instant of

time on the basis of echo measurement, a la Einstein. Thus, if a signal leaves s0 at t1 and returns

from s1 at t′1, the distance between s0 and s1 at time 1/2(t1 + t′1) is 1/2(t′1 −

t1). Similarly, for

28

the distance between s0 and s2, and the distance between s0 and s3. But, what does “distance

between s1 and s2” mean and at what time? The point to be noted is that happenings at the

stations s1, s2, s3 cannot be treated as just some events. The stations and observations made on

them provide a foundation for deﬁning and calculating the time and position of a remote event.

For this, as pointed out earlier, we need all the four stations. The position of a reﬂecting station,

say s1, cannot be determined using only the three stations s0, s2 and s3. Perhaps, the only way

out is to adjust the positions of s1, s2, s3 so that the tetrahedron s0s1s2s3 remains unchanged. If,

however, this is not done, the observer could keep sending the signal and keep receiving echoes,

three direct and six indirect, from s1, s2, s3, in all possible ways, thereby obtaining nine functions

of the time of transmission. To this, he could add four echoes, one direct and three indirect, from

the object being observed. Thus, he would have thirteen functions of time as his experimental data

for the object being observed. Perhaps, this data could be used to build a model of the motions of

the stations and the object being observed.

Similar considerations will apply to the other observer. It may seem that we could do away

with the assumption that the stations σ0, σ1, σ2, σ3 move together with the same constant velocity

if we suppose that system S ascertains their positions continuously. But what about σ0’s own

observations of σ1, σ2, σ3? We do not want to assume any a priori relation between S’s clock and

Σ’s clock. We assumed that there was some relation between these clocks, and that what S ﬁnds

to be “rigid” (the tetrahedron σ0σ1σ2σ3) Σ also ﬁnds to be rigid. Perhaps, one could assume that

Σ borrows S’s time, that is to say, that the times at σ0 are what S assigns to them. It seems that

this is exactly what the GPS receiver does; it updates or corrects its clock on the basis of signals

received from the space vehicles.

In practice, in GPS, one does expect that the master control station and the monitor stations

do remain ﬁxed relative to one another. (Does one actually check this out?) Of course, in the event

of an earthquake (or continental drift), these distances could change with time.

5.4.2

Is the second observer necessary ?

Is it necessary to think of the second observer as a “real” observer, with his own “real” clock?

Could we not let the ﬁrst observer perform a “gedanken” calculation to ﬁnd out what a second

observer would observe? (This is precisely what we have done!) As indicated towards the end of

Sec. 5.2, for an event P (p, t) observed by the ﬁrst observer S, assuming that the system Σ has a

“known” uniform motion relative to S, the departure and arrival times t′0, t0, t1, t2, t3 at σ0 can be

calculated in terms of p, t, and the δ’s. As shown in Sec. 5.1, “rigidity” in Σ of the straight line

29

through σ0 and σ1 implies a simple relation between the two clocks, namely :

τ = β1t.

Why not then dispense with Σ’s clock and let him instead use S’s clock, i.e., to use these calculated

time instants? This will do away with the problem of what happens to a “real” clock when it is

put in uniform motion. Of course, Σ’s calculation of the space aspect π of the event P are diﬀerent

from S’s calculation p simply because Σ’s data is diﬀerent. Also, Σ’s calculation of the time aspect

τ of the event P is diﬀerent from S’s calculation t for the same reason.

moving observer, namely:

In his derivation,Einstein makes use of the classical “relative position” of an event, relative to a

where x is the position of the event in the “stationary system” and v is the velocity of the “moving

system”. (His “x′” thus corresponds to our ¯p = p

σ0(t).) However, in the ﬁnal formulas he uses

the variable x. His formulas relating the time and place determinations by the two observers are:

where β = 1/

v2/c2. Note that ξ diﬀers from (x

vt) by a multiplying coeﬃcient, whereas the

expression for τ involves a peculiar combination of t and x. (Einstein’s derivation of the formula for

ξ appears to be incomplete because he derives it only for a special class of events, namely x = ct,

which agrees with Einstein’s expression.

Hence, we can say that we have generalized Einstein’s derivation in two respects: ﬁrstly, we

have deﬁned the co-ordinate system used operationally, and secondly, we have derived the formulas

for any arbitrary direction of the velocity v of the “moving” system relative to the “stationary”

system.

6.2 Velocity of Light in the two Systems

Where have we used the velocity of light in our derivations? We have used it in deﬁning “distance”

in terms of “time diﬀerence” and we chose it to be “1” and the same for both systems. It should

be clear that the choice of the velocity of light in each system is arbitrary. We do not imply by this

that the velocity of light is arbitrary in practice, or that it cannot be measured in practice. What

we mean is that in deﬁning distance in our approach, a constant is used which, by analogy with

mechanics of stretched cords, rigid rods and mobile observers, may be called “velocity of light” in

our system. It seems to us that the times and distances, and, therefore, also the velocity of light,

31

in the two systems are non-commensurate in the sense of Kuhn. System S cannot measure velocity

of light in its own system, leave alone measure the velocity of light in Σ’s system! We have, of

course, assumed a “correspondence” between the clocks of S and Σ, but this is something which

neither S nor Σ alone could observe. Σ’s clock is not observable by S and vice versa. Perhaps, only

an omniscient observer can act as a go-between and actually observe that the two times at σ0 are

related, by conducting an appropriate experiment. Thus, one (or someone on one’s behalf - unless

one travels with the light signal) can send a signal from σ0 to s0 at observed Σ-time τ0, and receive

it at s0 at some observed S-time t from which one can calculate the S-time t0 of departure of the

signal from σ0, and then ﬁnd that

τ0 = β1t0,

where β1 is a constant, independent of τ0.

6.3 “Faster-than-Light” Observer, “Faster-than-light” Particles and Composi-

tion of Velocities

“Faster - than - Light” particles have been much discussed in the literature 13. In our approach, we

determine the time and place of an event by using the transmission and reception times of signals.

An event is detected or recognized to have happened only if the observer (in S) receives an echo and

reﬂected signals and these signals satisfy the necessary triangle inequalities for a tetrahedron. We

have, therefore, no basis for answering the question: “can there be a faster-than-light particle?”.

However, if the observer in S does ﬁnd that the other system Σ is moving faster than light

1), then as pointed out above, σ0 of Σ will not be able to see any event P that is seen by

v

|| ≥

(
||
S, because no echo from P will reach σ0.

We thus conclude that it is useless to consider a system Σ which moves, relative to S, faster

that light because such a system will not see any event seen by S. Note that the reason for this

happening is not any expression like “√1

v2” appearing in our derivation. Einstein had concluded

−

that “for velocities greater than that of light our deliberations become meaningless” for a diﬀerent

reason, namely, the shortening of lengths by the factor √1

v2.

−

But the above considerations need not deter us from envisaging faster-than-light particles,

because we have shown above that any event P which is seen by S is also visible to Σ, provided

v

< 1. Indeed, we can derive a law of “composition of velocities”. Let P move uniformly with a

||

||
velocity w, i.e., we consider a family of events given by

p(t) = tw + constant,

32

Then, for τ and π, we obtain:

and so

and

¯p(t) = t(w

v) + constant,

τ = β1t

γ[(w

v)

v]

= γ[1

(w

·

−
v)]t

·

so that the velocity of P relative to Σ will be:

π = T ( ¯p) = tT (w

v) + constant,

−

T (w

v)/(γ[1

(w

v)]).

−

−

·

−

−

−

·

This leads to the following possibilities. If w

v < 1, which can happen even if

> 1, i.e., P

travels faster than light, then the “direction” of “time” τ in Σ is same as the “direction” of “time”

t in S. But if w

v > 1, then there is a time-reversal from S to Σ. However, this time reversal will

·

not be seen by both S and Σ; it is only an omniscient observer who will notice it. If w

v = 1, then

w

||

||

·

τ = 0, so that Σ will see P’s whole “history” in one moment!

In the special case when w is in the same direction as v, we obtain a simple expression for the

magnitude of the relative velocity, which is similar to Einstein’s formula. Indeed, if w = kv where

k is a real number, then the magnitude of the relative velocity is:

(k

1)/(1

−

It is interesting to note that Einstein in his paper has nowhere ruled out faster-than-light

particles. We show in Sec. 7.4 that there is no diﬃculty in considering faster-than-light particles

in electrodynamics.

6.4 “One-way” and “Two-way” Velocity of Light

It should be clear that in our approach, velocity of the signal (light) is an “undeﬁned” concept. It is

more like a mere number, used to deﬁne “distance” in terms of time. So the velocity of light, whether

one-way or two-way, is not something which can be measured in our system. Also, “homogeneity”

or “isotropy” perhaps are not properties of some independently conceived or experienced “space”,

but are rather a matter of assumption about the representation of “travel” of light.

6.5 Symmetry

In the calculations above, v was the velocity of Σ as seen by S. What will be the velocity of S as

seen by Σ? Will it be −v? No, we should not expect it to be −v simply because of the choice

33

involved, of the vector spaces L and Λ, in setting up the co-ordinate systems in S and Σ. But we

can use our formula relating π and ¯p, by taking P to be the origin of S, so that

and since

we have in Σ

π = T ( ¯p) =

T ( ¯σ0) + ( ¯σ0

v)T (v)

(τ /γ)T (v)

−

so that the velocity of S relative to Σ will be

which need not be −v. (v is in the space L, T (v) is in the space Λ.) However, we show below that

v independent of how φ(v) is

chosen.(Einstein chooses φ(v) = 1, using some symmetry conditions for the motion.)

To show that

6.6 The “Group Property” and “Inertial Frames of Reference”

We ﬁrst note that Einstein uses the expression “system of co-ordinates” rather than “inertial frame

of reference”. We can see from our derivations in Sec. 5 what role is played by the assumption that

Σ is in uniform motion relative to S. If the motion of Σ (even if the tetrahedron σ0σ1σ2σ3 stays

“rigid”) were arbitrary, not much simple could be said about the relation between the times at

σ0 of the two systems, and hence, of the relations between the co-ordinates of any event by them.

However, as seen in Sec. 6.3 above, if we have one more system Σ′ in uniform motion at velocity

w relative to S, then it will be also in uniform motion relative to Σ (provided w

v

= 1), so that

·

in this sense we have the group property for the set of observers in uniform motion relative to one

another. But the relative times and co-ordinates are determined only within an unknown multiplier

like β1. It is convenient, of course, to assume, with Einstein, that

but then only an omniscient observer could verify whether this is so or not.

β1 = β =

v2/c2,

1

6.7 Length “Contraction” and Time “Dilatation”

We have the relation

δ1 = γ

(1

v2)d2

1 + (d1

v)2,

·

−

p

35

6
where γ = β1/(1

v2) and so, the distance between σ0 and σ1 in S, namely d1, need not be the

−

same as the distance between them in Σ, unless β1 is chosen “properly”. But then we have the

other two relations also to worry about:

δ2 = γ

(1

v2)d2

2 + (d2

δ3 = γ

p

(1

v2)d2

3 + (d3

−

−

v)2

v)2

·

·

p

and so we cannot have all the equalities δ1 = d1, δ2 = d2, δ3 = d3 unless v = 0 and β1 = 1.

But then what is this contraction or change in “length” in our approach? As we have remarked

above, distance in S and distance in Σ are non-commensurate or independent concepts, though

their numerical values could be related.

A similar comment could be made with regard to time dilatation. Time (clock) in S and time

(clock) in Σ are independent concepts, although, if we assume the “rigidity” condition, they are

numerically related; thus, at σ0

τ = β1t.

But the coeﬃcient β1 is entirely arbitrary, or rather will be known only to an omniscient observer

who can read both the clocks. If we choose β1 so that φ(v) = β1/√1

v2 = 1, with Einstein, then

−

we do have τ = √1

v2t, a case of time dilatation. With this choice, it turns out that at s0 in S,

−

there is a time dilatation by the same factor, i.e., t = √1

v2τ .

−

6.8 The “Twin Paradox”

We observe that neither in Einstein’s approach nor in our approach can anything be said about

what will happen when an observer, previously at rest, is set in motion. Although Einstein does

say that “now to the origin of one of the two systems (k) let a constant velocity v be imparted in

the direction of the increasing x of the other stationary system (K)”, his derivations nowhere use

this conception. It is unfortunate that this way of putting it seems to have led him to formulate

what has become known, after Langevin, as the “twin paradox”. To emphasize again, Einstein’s

theory does not say anything as to what happens when a “clock” is set in motion. In our approach,

we start with the premise that there are two observers, and that one of them is (already) in motion

relative to the other. We, therefore, feel that the speculations by Einstein are not justiﬁed. Further,

for the clock to return to its starting point, he had to “assume that the result proved for a polygonal

line is also valid for a continuously curved line”.

36

6.9 Invariance of other Laws of Physics

It is surprising that Einstein was not tempted to consider some other Laws of Physics for an

application of his “Principle of Relativity”. Does the “Principle of Relativity” apply to another

time-honored Law of Physics, much older than the Maxwell-Hertz Law, namely, Newton’s Law of

Universal Gravitation? Or, an even earlier, simpler, Law, namely, Hooke’s Law ? Both these laws

involve the concept of simultaneity at a distance because both of them refer to the positions of two

bodies at the same instant of time. (Levich 14 says : “. . . the theory of relativity is incompatible with

the notion of action at a distance. Two events can be in a mutual relationship as cause and eﬀect

only where they occur at the same place simultaneously as is required by the concept of short-range

action.) In the Law of Universal Gravitation, the instantaneous force on each of several mutually

gravitating bodies depends (in the inverse square manner) on the distances of that body from the

other bodies at that same instant. Similarly, for a massless spring, the force exerted by the spring

at each end at each instant depends on the distance between the two ends at that instant. Now,

recalling Einstein’s observation “that two events which, viewed from a system of co-ordinates, are

simultaneous, can no longer be looked upon as simultaneous events when envisaged from a system

which is in motion relatively to that system”, we see that the matter of invariance of Newton’s Law

of Universal Gravitation and of Hooke’s Law (perhaps along with Newton’s Third Law of Motion)

requires investigation.

We can show easily that Hooke’s Law does not satisfy the “Principle of Relativity”, that is to

say, invariance of form under the Lorentz-Einstein transformation. First, we show that the form of

variation of a physical variable may not remain invariant under the Lorentz-Einstein transformation.

Suppose a particle has a sinusoidal motion in the x-direction of the stationary system K, its position

x(t) at time t being given by

x(t) = sin(t)

(For example, such would be the classical frictionless motion of a point mass connected to a spring

whose other end is ﬁxed.) Considering the special case when system k moves relatively to K in the

direction of the x-axis of K with velocity v, we have the familiar relations :

What will be the form of motion in system k? Will it be sinusoidal also, i.e., given by

for some constants a, ω and φ ? The answer is : “no”, as will be seen by substituting for τ and ξ,

τ = β(t

vx/c2),

ξ = β(x

vt).

−

−

ξ(τ ) = a sin(ωτ + φ)

37

(41)

(42)

(43)

using Eqs. (42), in Eq. (43), since we do not obtain an identity. (Interestingly, MacColl 15 shows

that with the relativistic variation of mass, the motion of the mass-spring system is not sinusoidal.)

Similarly, a uniformly accelerated motion in K does not remain uniformly accelerated in k.

However, a uniform motion in K remains uniform in k - as we know already from the Law of

Composition of Velocities.

Perhaps, one could modify Laws such as Hooke’s Law and Newton’s Law of Universal Gravita-

tion by using the pre-Einsteinian idea of “retarded argument”.

7 A NEW LOOK AT THE “ELECTRODYNAMICAL PART”

OF EINSTEIN’S PAPER

It seems that Einstein may have had (at least) the following diﬀerent motivations in writing his 1

(not necessarily in the order of their importance for him) :

1. giving operational meaning to the “time” of a remote event, unlike the “Ortzeit” of Lorentz;

2. deriving the “theory of transformation of co-ordinates and times”, using this operational

meaning of time and the sameness of the velocity of light in the two systems, independent of

the velocity of the emitting body;

3. deriving the invariance of the form of one particular “law” of physics, namely, the Maxwell-

Hertz equations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (his “Principle of Relativity”); and, of course,

4. deriving several new results.

Einstein, however, did not give an operational meaning to the co-ordinates of a remote event.

We have shown how this could be done. As mentioned above, it seems it is not necessary to think

of the second system of co-ordinates and time as being “real”. It is enough to model the second

system within the ﬁrst system.

As we show in Sec. 7.2 below, the invariance of the form of the Maxwell-Hertz equations does

not follow from the theory of transformation of co-ordinates and times. Rather, if we assume the

invariance and Planck’s formula for the transformation of mass, then the Lorentz force equation

remains invariant! Thus, the surprising outcome is that insistence on the invariance of some laws

(Maxwell-Hertz equations, Lorentz force equation) suggests a change in the formulation of some

other law, namely, Newton’s Second Law of Motion, or more speciﬁcally, in the expression for

“accelerative force” in Newton’s Second Law.

38

The ﬁrst part of Einstein’s paper, titled “The Kinematical Part”, is really about the relation

between time and space determination of events in two diﬀerent observation systems.

(In our

treatment, the space co-ordinatization is a deﬁned concept.) However, usually, it has been taken

to be about “transformation of co-ordinates”. This being the case, in electrodynamics, and in

particular, as far as Maxwell’s equations are concerned, what are the events being studied? The

X, Y, Z components of the electric ﬁeld and the L, M, N components of the magnetic ﬁeld are not

events! In fact, there could be a “vicious cycle” here since the very determination of time and space

uses light (signal) which, following Maxwell, is believed to be an electromagnetic phenomenon. Even

the application of the “relativistic” approach to mechanics will engender light in the observation

of mechanical phenomena. But then this would need a new approach to electrodynamics and the

“winning” of Maxwell’s equations.

7.1 Einstein’s “New Manner of Expression” and “Dynamics of the slowly ac-

celerated Electron”

Taking Maxwell’s equations for granted, as does Einstein, it appears that there is a ﬂaw in the

section “Transformation of the Maxwell-Hertz Equations for Empty Space. On the Nature of the

Electromotive Forces Occurring in a Magnetic Field During Motion” in the “Electrodynamical

Part” of Einstein’s paper. To point it out, we need to quote him at length.

“Let the Maxwell-Hertz equations for empty space hold good for the stationary system K, so

Now the principle of relativity requires that if the Maxwell-Hertz equations for empty space

hold good in system K, they also hold good in system k; that is to say that the vectors of the

electric and the magnetic force—(X′, Y′, Z′) and (L′, M′, N′)—of the moving system k, which

are deﬁned by their ponderomotive eﬀects on electric or magnetic masses respectively, satisfy the

following equations:—

Evidently the two systems of equations found for system k must express exactly the same thing,

since both systems of equations are equivalent to the Maxwell-Hertz equations for system K. Since,

further, the equations of the two systems agree, with the exception of the symbols for the vectors,

it follows that the functions occurring in the systems of equations at corresponding places must

agree, with the exception of a factor ψ(v), which is common for all functions of the one system of

equations, and is independent of ξ, η, ζ and τ but depends upon v.” [our italics].

40

Is the last sentence of the quotation above (our italics) a valid conclusion from the preceding

discussion? (Einstein’s notation could cause some confusion; he uses the same letter, X, for example,

to denote both a function of (x, y, z, t) and of (ξ, η, ζ, τ ), having, of course, the same value

at the corresponding quadruples (x, y, z, t) and (ξ, η, ζ, τ ).) Indeed, two pages later (“Theory

of Doppler’s Principle and of Aberration”), Einstein uses a non-zero solution of the Maxwell-Hertz

equations in free space. So, all that Einstein is entitled to say is that the diﬀerences X′ −

then these new functions would describe a ﬁeld in the moving system that would satisfy the Maxwell-

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

Hertz equations as “required” by the Principle of Relativity. Thus, the Principle of Relativity is a

guiding principle rather than a physical law.

Einstein goes on to interpret the ﬁeld transformation equations. We quote again:

“Consequently the ﬁrst three equations above allow themselves to be clothed in words in the two

following ways:—

1. If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic ﬁeld, there acts upon it, in

addition to the electric force, an “electromotive force” which, if we neglect the terms multiplied by

the second and higher powers of v/c, is equal to the vector-product of the velocity of the charge

and the magnetic force, divided by the velocity of light. (Old manner of expression.)

2. If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic ﬁeld, the force acting upon

it is equal to the electric force which is present at the locality of the charge, and which we ascertain

41

by transformation of the ﬁeld to a system of co-ordinates at rest relatively to the electrical charge.

(New manner of expression.)”

Now, his “old manner of expression” corresponds to the Lorentz force equations. What may

have caused Einstein to think of the “new manner of expression”? If (x(t), y(t), z(t)) denotes the

instantaneous position of the charge in S, the x-, y- and z- components of the force produced by

the ﬁeld are then given by the Lorentz equations :

Fy = Y +

If we put ˙x = v, ˙y = 0, ˙z = 0, then the expressions on the right-hand-side of the equations above

look almost like the expressions on the right-hand-side of the ﬁeld transformation equations.

His “new manner of expression” has charmed a number of authors because it seems to reduce

electrodynamics to electrostatics. But it does not seem to have been realized that the new manner

is not useful when the electric charge does not have a uniform motion, or when there is more than

one moving charge. Further, we show below that we can hold on to the Lorentz force equations

for arbitrary motion of the charge in the stationary system because they will hold in the moving

system too provided we make an important change, as suggested by Planck, in the way we handle

“mass”. Einstein himself seems to have been charmed by his new manner of expression so that he

has to consider “the slowly accelerated electron” in the last section of his paper “Dynamics of the

Slowly Accelerated Electron”, and use language like :

“If the electron is at rest at a given epoch, the motion of the electron ensues in the next instant

of time [our italics] according to the equations

m d2x

dt2 = ǫX , m d2y

dt2 = ǫY , m d2z

dt2 = ǫZ

where x, y, z denote the co-ordinates of the electron, and m the mass of the electron, as long as its

motion is slow.

Now, secondly, let the velocity of the electron at a given epoch be v. We seek the law of motion

of the electron in the immediately ensuing instants of time.” [our italics].

Einstein applies his ﬁeld transformation theory to the motion of an electron, by noting that the

ﬁeld quantities X, Y, Z, and X′, Y′, Z′ do determine the force acting on the electron. But what is

“force” acting on a moving body? Einstein ﬁnds out that if we “maintain the equation—mass

Of course, J.J.Thomson and others had deduced earlier that a moving electron has a velocity-

dependent mass, but their approach was diﬀerent from Einstein’s. Einstein’s approach hinges on

his “Theory of Transformation of Co-ordinates and Times”, which, in turn, follows from his two

Postulates. Further, Einstein suggested: “With a diﬀerent deﬁnition of force and acceleration

we should naturally obtain other values for the masses”. Perhaps, Planck 16 was inspired by this

suggestion. Also, Einstein boldly asserted : “. . . these results as to the mass are also valid for

ponderable material points, because a ponderable material point can be made into an electron (in

our sense of the word) by the addition of an electric charge, no matter how small.”

7.2 Lorentz Force and “variable” Mass

We show below that if accelerative force is deﬁned as suggested by Planck 16, then the equations

of motion of a charge in the stationary system under the action of the Lorentz force imply the

equations of motion of a charge in the moving system under the action of the Lorentz force. We

are also able to see a “reason” why a dynamics in which the mass of a charged body is constant,

independent of the velocity, is not compatible with the invariance of the Maxwell-Hertz equations

and the Lorentz force equations. It should be pointed out that Planck, in his derivation, surprisingly

says that v is to be replaced by

˙x2 + ˙y2 + ˙z2 in Eqs. (46) and Eqs. (52) below (“indem ¨uberall

q an die Stelle von v gesetzt wird”, Planck’s “q” being

p

˙x2 + ˙y2 + ˙z2).

We will consider here only the special case studied by Einstein where the moving system Σ

p

(Einstein’s “k”) moves with a constant velocity v in the direction of the x-axis of the stationary

system S (Einstein’s K). Let us assume that the ﬁeld quantities X, Y, Z, L, M, N determine the

force acting on a unit moving charge as given by Lorentz’s formula. If (x(t), y(t), z(t)) denotes

the instantaneous position of the charge in S, the x-, y- and z- components of the force produced

by the ﬁeld are then given by Eqs. (45).

The motion of the charge as seen by the moving observer Σ is given by (ξ(τ ), η(τ ), ζ(τ )) where

(In his study of the slowly accelerated electron, Einstein eﬀectively sets “at a given epoch” ˙x = v,
β2 , ¨ξ = β3 ¨x, ¨η = β2 ¨y, ¨ζ = β2 ¨z.)

˙y = 0, ˙z = 0 but ¨x, ¨y, ¨z may not be zero at that epoch, so that u = 1

where X′, Y′, Z′, L′, M′, N′ as functions of (ξ, η, ζ, τ ) are related to X, Y, Z, L, M, N by the

Einstein relations, then we ﬁnd (with Planck) 18 that these are related to the Lorentz forces in S as

follows:

Note that these relations do not involve mass. (These relations were derived by Planck 18 exactly

as we have done above, and not on the basis of some other principles, as stated by Miller 19.)

We now see that if we assume the mass of a charged body to be a constant, say, m, in-

dependent of its velocity, so that the accelerative force components are given by the product

(mass

acceleration component), then the equations of motion in S:

×

m¨x = Fx

, m¨y = Fy

, m¨z = Fz

,

will not imply the equations of motion in Σ:

m ¨ξ = Fξ

, m¨η = Fη

, m¨ζ = Fζ

.

Suppose that following Planck’s suggestion we deﬁne the accelerative force to be the time-rate

of change of momentum, assuming that the mass has a dependence on velocity given by

m(t) = m0/

the accelerative force components in Σ are deﬁned by

F ξ = d

dτ (m ˙ξ)

, F η = d

dτ (m ˙η)

, F ζ = d

dτ (m ˙ζ)

.

(57)

Fortunately, on using the relations between the velocity and acceleration components in S with

those in Σ we ﬁnd that with this deﬁnition of accelerative force, the accelerative forces in Σ are

related to the accelerative forces in S by relations, which are analogous to the relations between

the Lorentz forces, as follows:

v
uc2 ˙yF y −

v

F ξ = F x −
F η =

F ζ =

(58)

(59)

(60)

if and only if m′0 = m0 (this corresponds to Einstein’s conclusion that ψ(v) = 1). (We have not

seen Eqs. (58) stated explicitly in the literature.)

So, it follows immediately that the equations of motion in S:

F x = Fx

, F y = Fy

, F z = Fz

,

imply the equations of motion in Σ:

F ξ = Fξ

, F η = Fη

, F ζ = Fζ

.

In fact, what we need is that the ratio (mass constant/charge) has the same value in S and Σ.

If we assume that the charge has the same value in S and Σ, then the constant in the deﬁnition of

accelerative force has to be the same for both S and Σ, i.e., to be independent of the observer. It

could be termed the “absolute mass” or even the “rest mass”, since it is the mass when the velocity

is zero no matter in which system. (It may be better not to refer to quantities like m(t) above as

“mass” or “variable mass”. What matters is how a co-ordinate dependent quantity “accelerative

force” is deﬁned in relation to a co-ordinate independent constant called (mass) and co-ordinate

dependent position and time.)

45

7.3 Maxwell-Hertz, Lorentz, Einstein, and Planck

Thus, the Einstein transformation of co-ordinates and times, the Einstein transformation of ﬁeld

quantities, the Maxwell-Hertz equations, the Lorentz force equations, and the Planck deﬁnition

of accelerative force all hang together as well in the stationary system S as in the moving system

Σ. Einstein’s “new manner of expression” for the force on a moving charge is not required at all

and we do not have to agree with Einstein that the “electromotive force plays in the developed

theory merely the part of an auxiliary concept”. “Newtonian mechanics” can be seen to be valid

for charged bodies if instead of Newton’s deﬁnition of accelerative force, we use Planck’s deﬁnition.

It is interesting that Einstein’s insistence that “the laws by which the states of physical systems

undergo change are not aﬀected, whether these changes of state be referred to the one or the

other of two systems of co-ordinates in uniform translatory motion” has led to a new deﬁnition of

accelerative force.

7.4 Other Deﬁnitions of accelerative Force

We might ask: are there other deﬁnitions of accelerative force which will work? We show immedi-

ately that if we assume that the mass is a diﬀerentiable function only of ( ˙x2 + ˙y2 + ˙z2), then the

only functions that will work are the Planck function and a function that we give below. Denoting

( ˙x2 + ˙y2 + ˙z2) by q as before and a desired accelerative force function by m(q), on substituting in

p
Eqs. (58) and using the fact that ˙x, ˙y, ˙z are arbitrary, in particular, ˙x = v, we obtain the following

diﬀerential equation for m:

c2
the solution of which is, not k0{

except for q = c. Thus, the solution has two branches:

for q < c, and

for q > c.

i.e., that the body moves more slowly than light, if the body moves faster than light, i.e., if

we could use the formula :

˙x2 + ˙y2 + ˙z2 > c2,

m(t) = m0/

so that there is no need to agree with Einstein that “Velocities greater than that of light have - as in

our previous results - no possibilities of existence” and to entertain any idea of “purely imaginary”

mass for faster-than-light bodies. Incidentally, we ﬁnd that

so that a body moves faster-than-light in S if and only if it moves faster-than-light in Σ. Perhaps

this result can be proved in the general framework of Sec. 5.

7.5 Charged Bodies Traveling at the Speed of Light

Of course, there is a singularity in the formula for mass when the body moves as fast as light. What

should be the mass formula for the case ˙x2 + ˙y2 + ˙z2 = c2? (It is possible that this equality may

hold over an interval of time, and not at just one time instant.) Note that when q = c we also have

˙ξ2 + ˙η2 + ˙ζ 2 = c, so that the mass of such a charged body must be the same in both S and Σ,

q
say, mc. Assuming that the Newtonian deﬁnition of accelerative force holds in this case, we ﬁnd

that Eqs. (58) will be satisﬁed only with mc = 0, i.e., the charged body has zero mass in S and Σ.

In that case, the ﬁeld must be such that the Lorentz force components are zero, i.e., in Eqs. (45),

Fx = Fy = Fz = 0. The resulting system of equations for ˙x, ˙y, ˙z in terms of X, Y, Z, L, M, N has

zero determinant. A simple calculation shows that for a solution to exist, the following condition

must be satisﬁed :

XL + YM + ZN = 0 ,

i.e., the electric ﬁeld vector must be perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld vector. Under this con-

dition, we can solve the equations for ˙y, ˙z in terms of ˙x and the ﬁeld components, and substitute

these in the velocity condition:

˙x2 + ˙y2 + ˙z2 = c2 ,

obtaining a quadratic equation for ˙x:

(61)

(62)

(63)

(64)

(L2 + M2 + N2) ˙x2 + 2c(MZ

NY) ˙x + c2(Y2 + Z2

L2) = 0 .

(65)

−

−

47

This equation has real solutions if and only if

L2 + M2 + N2

X2 + Y2 + Z2 ,

≥

(66)

i.e., the magnetic ﬁeld is at least as strong as the electric ﬁeld.

Thus, if the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are mutually perpendicular and the magnetic ﬁeld is

at least as strong as the electric ﬁeld, the question of the possibility of the motion of zero-mass

charged bodies at the speed of light amounts to the existence of the solution of Eqs. (45) with

their left-hand-sides set equal to zero alongwith the velocity condition Eq. (64). Note that the ﬁeld

components are to be evaluated along the motion.

One can immediately verify that in the case of the ﬁeld corresponding to a plane wave, a

motion in straight line in any direction at the speed of light is possible in such a ﬁeld. Could

one conjecture that a photon may be a zero-mass charged body with an “inﬁnitesimally small”

charge, just as Einstein thought that “a ponderable material point can be made into an electron

(in our sense of the word) by the addition of an electric charge, no matter how small”? (With zero

accelerative force, the magnitude of the charge has no eﬀect on the motion !) Thus, light, instead

of being an electromagnetic wave, could consist of zero-mass charged particles moving in a suitable

electromagnetic ﬁeld. Could some appropriate ﬁeld allow motion at the speed of light in a circle?

Finally, could there be a “light barrier” so that a motion cannot reach the speed of light even

for one instant, whether from “below” or from “above”?

8 CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have extended Einstein’s admonition - “a mathematical description of this kind has no physical

meaning unless we are quite clear as to what we understand by “time” ”- to apply to the concept

of “place” or “co-ordinates”, i.e., of a co-ordinate system. We have shown how by considering a

system S of an observer with a clock, aided by three reﬂecting stations, co-ordinates of a remote

event can be deﬁned and determined, as also the time of its occurrence.

Considering another system Σ “in uniform motion of translation relatively to” S, we have proved

that the co-ordinates and times in Σ are linearly related to the co-ordinates and times in S. The

“Lorentz transformation” relating the two could be calculated and turns out to be identical with

Einstein’s formulas in the special case considered by him.

We have emphasized that the co-ordinates are a matter of representation of the observed data

of times of transmission and reception of various signals by the observer. The representation we

have used, and the one Einstein implicitly assumed, namely, 3-dimensional Euclidean geometry, is

48

based on our “experience of space”, but it is only a representation of the data. This is not to say,

of course, that our experiences of seeing a remote object at a certain time in our clock at a certain

place are not “real”. Indeed, there should be no hesitation in saying that “That train arrives here

at 7 o’clock ”, or that, “I saw the occultation of Venus by the moon beginning at 7 p.m.”.

Is it possible that we may have experiences of departure and arrival times of signals which

cannot be represented in 3-dimensional geometry? Could we use some other representation even

if the 3-dimensional geometric representation is possible? (We do not mean here alternative co-

ordinate systems, such as the spherical-polar, etc.) Also, what we have represented are only certain

“points” in the “motion” of light signals ; thus we have supposed that light “leaves” at a certain

place at a certain time and “arrives” at another place at another time. Perhaps, we could try to

represent or model the entire path of the light signal. This might lead to a diﬀerent approach to

the “General Theory of Relativity”.

We have pointed out what appears to be a ﬂaw in the “Electrodynamical Part” of Einstein’s

paper. We have shown that we can use the Lorentz force formula in the stationary system as

well as in the moving system, and that Einstein’s interpretation of “electromotive force” as an

auxiliary concept is not necessary. Further, faster-than-light motions can be considered without

any diﬃculty.

Lastly, we should perhaps recall Einstein’s admonition again with regard to the atomic domain,

such as that of an electron, and seek for ourselves operational meanings of time and distance on

the atomic scale. Would the same signal suﬃce for this purpose? What would be a “clock”? What

would be “observed” and what would be “deﬁned” and “determined” in terms of what is observed?

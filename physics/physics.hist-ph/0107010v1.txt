Abstract

Path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations have become an im-
portant tool for the investigation of the statistical mechanics of quantum
systems. I discuss some of the history of applying the Monte Carlo method
to non-relativistic quantum systems in path-integral representation. The
principle feasibility of the method was well established by the early eight-
ies, a number of algorithmic improvements have been introduced in the
last two decades.

1 Introduction

Feynman’s classic paper of 1948 presented a Space-Time Approach to Non-
Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, [1] or, in Hagen Kleinert’s words, “an all-
time global approach to the calculation of quantum mechanical amplitudes.”
Within the philosophy of this approach, we must ﬁnd, as Kleinert often stressed,
“all properties, including the Schr¨odinger wave functions, from the globally
determined time displacement amplitude.” [2] The Feynman path, governed by
the classical Lagrangian of the quantum system, is the very object we need to
study if we want to establish a truly independent alternative to Schr¨odinger’s
equation. In avoiding the operator formalism, the sum over paths provides an
independent conceptual link between quantum and classical mechanics.

Another attractive feature of the path integral formulation of quantum me-
chanics is the bridge it allows to establish between quantum mechanics and sta-
tistical mechanics. Technically, the oscillating exponential of the time-displace-
ment amplitude turns into a positive Boltzmann weight if the paths are ex-
pressed in imaginary time. The quantum mechanical propagator thus turns
into a quantum statistical density matrix. It is this very feature which allows

the application of methods of classical statistical mechanics, notably the Monte
Carlo method, to quantum systems.

The Monte Carlo method came into being roughly around the same time as
the Feynman path. Anecdotally, the idea of gaining insight into a complex phe-
nomenon by making various trials and studying the proportions of the respective
outcomes occurred to Stanislaw Ulam while playing solitaire during an illness
in 1946 [3]. The immediate application was, of course, the problem of neutron
diﬀusion studied in Los Alamos at that time. The name of the procedure ﬁrst
appeared in print in a classic paper by Metropolis and Ulam in 1949 [4], where
the authors explicitly mentioned that the method they presented as a statis-
tical approach to the study of integro-diﬀerential equations would sometimes
be referred to as the Monte Carlo method. In classical statistical mechanics it
quickly became a standard calculational tool.

2 Where’s Monte Carlo?

The object of interest in Monte Carlo evaluations of Feynman’s path integral is
the quantum statistical partition function Z, given, in operator language, as the
trace of the density operator exp(−β ˆH) of the canonical ensemble (β = 1/kBT )
associated with a Hamilton operator describing N particles of mass mi moving
under the inﬂuence of a potential V ,

expressed in imaginary time τ .1 The particles are assumed to be distinguishable.
To evaluate the trace, we only need to set r = r′ and integrate over r. To take
into account Bose or Fermi statistics for indistinguishable particles, the partition
function splits into a sum of the direct Boltzmann part and parts with permuted
endpoints.

1There have been attempts to apply the Monte Carlo method to path integrals also for
real time. However, due to the oscillating exponential one then has to deal with problems of
numerical cancellation, and it is much harder to obtain results of some numerical accuracy.
Therefore, I shall here restrict myself to Monte Carlo work in imaginary time.

2

The right hand side of Eq. (2) is a path integral for the 3N functions r.
The idea of a Monte Carlo evaluation of this quantity is to sample these paths
stochastically and to get (approximate) information about the quantum statis-
tics of the system by averaging over the ﬁnite set of paths generated in the
sampling process.

Monte Carlo data always come with error bars and, in general, the errors
associated with numerical Monte Carlo data stem from two distinct sources. A
systematic error of Monte Carlo evaluations of the path integral follows from
the need to identify the paths by a ﬁnite amount of computer information.
This can be done by discretizing the paths at some set of points in the interval
(0, ¯hβ). For a single particle moving in one dimension, the simplest discrete
time approximation for L time slices reads (ǫ = ¯hβ/L)

L of points xi on the discretized time axis or by the ﬁnite number L′ of Fourier
components ak that are taken into account in the Monte Carlo sampling of the
paths.



The other error source of Monte Carlo data is the statistical error due to
the ﬁnite number Nm of paths that form the sample used for evaluating the
statistical averages. To make matters worse, the probability of conﬁgurations
is, in general highly peaked, making an independent sampling of paths highly
ineﬃcient in most cases. The remedy is to introduce some way of “importance
sampling” where conﬁgurations are generated according to their probability
given by the exponential in Eq. (2). Statistical averages may then be computed

3

as simple arithmetic means. A way to achieve this is by constructing Markov
chains where transition probabilities between conﬁguration are constructed that
allow to generate a new conﬁguration from a given one such that in the limit
of inﬁnitely many conﬁgurations the correct probability distribution of paths
results. A very simple and universally applicable algorithm to set up such a
Markov chain is the Metropolis algorithm introduced in 1953 [5]. Here a new
conﬁguration is obtained by looking at some conﬁguration with only one variable
changed and accepting or rejecting it for the sample on the basis of a simple rule
that depends only on the respective energies of the two conﬁgurations. The ad-
vantages of importance sampling on the basis of Markov chains are obtained on
the cost that, in general, successive conﬁgurations are not statistically indepen-
dent but autocorrelated. The crucial quantity is the integrated autocorrelation

With Monte Carlo generated samples of Feynman paths one can thus “mea-

and the speciﬁc heat, but also gain more detailed information about correlation
functions, probability distributions and the like. In the low-temperature limit,
β → ∞, quantum mechanical ground state properties are recovered.

A pioneer in the application of the Monte Carlo method to physics problems,
notably by applying it to the Ising model, was Lloyd D. Fosdick. He ap-
pears to have also been one of the ﬁrst to consider the stochastic sampling
of paths. In 1962, he considered the possibility of sampling paths [6] for what
he called the conditional Wiener integral, i.e. the Wiener integral for ﬁxed end
points. As a toy example he investigated the expectation value of the func-
for a conditional Wiener process, and,

more generally, for the quantity exp

putation of the partition function for a quantum particle moving in a poten-

these by direct Monte Carlo sampling of the Fourier components as Gaus-
sian stochastic variables. He did some explicit sampling of his toy model to
demonstrate the feasibility of the method but a theoretical consideration of
the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator was not considered worthwhile to be
put on the computer, even though Fosdick at the time was at the University

of Illinois and had access to the university’s ILLIAC computer. His examples
were primarily used to investigate the principle feasibility and possible accu-
racy obtainable by the method. Instead, Fosdick went along to consider a pair
of two identical particles and presented some numerical results for this prob-
lem. Continuation of the work on the two-particle problem together with a
graduate student led to the publication of a paper on the Slater sum, i.e. the
diagonal density matrix elements, for He4 in 1966 [7], and on three-particle ef-
fects in the pair distribution function for He4 in 1968 [8].
In the same year
[9], Fosdick elaborated on the numerical method in a report on the Monte
Carlo method in quantum statistics in the SIAM review. Instead of sampling
the Fourier components he now used the discrete time approximation of the
paths. Sampling of xi at the discrete points was done using a trick that later
would gain prominence in PIMC simulations in an algorithm called staging. The
idea is to express the discretized kinetic term in the relative probablity density
p(xi|xi−1, xi+1) = (1/2πǫ) exp
as −(xi −
¯xi)2/2σ2 +(xi−1 −xi+1)2/4ǫ with ¯xi = (xi−1 +xi+1)/2 and to sample (xi − ¯xi)/σ
as an independent Gaussian variable. The procedure could be iterated recur-
sively for all xi and thus allowed to obtain statistically independent paths which
were used to “measure” the potential energy term exp

−(xi − xi−1)2/2ǫ − (xi+1 − xi)2/2ǫ

In 1969, Lawande, Jensen, and Sahlin introduced Metropolis sampling of
the paths in discrete time, broken line approximation [10]. They investigated
the ground state wave functions of simple one-dimensional problems (harmonic
oscillator, square well, and Morse potential) and, theoretically, also addressed
the problem of extracting information about excited energies and of simulating
many particle problems. In a follow-up paper [11] they presented investigations
of the Coulomb problem using Monte Carlo simulations of the path integral
in polar coordinates. Not surprisingly, the singularity at the origin had to be
avoided by artiﬁcial constraints and the authors admitted that a more rigorous
justiﬁcation of their procedure was called for. The path integral was later solved
It became clear that there were
exactly by Duru and Kleinert in 1979 [12].
fundamental problems with such singularities in time-sliced path integrals [2].
Little activity is recorded in the seventies, and I am only aware of a brief
theoretical consideration of the possibility of Monte Carlo sampling of paths
in a paper by Morita on the solution of the Bloch equation for many particle
systems in terms of path integrals from 1973 [13]. The paper is cited in a
later one by J.A. Barker published in 1979 [14] in which the one-dimensional
particle in a box is considered, and numerical estimations of the ground state
energy and wave function are presented. The data were obtained by introducing
image sources to take account of the boundary conditions of the box and using
Metropolis sampling of the broken line approximation of the paths. Incidentally,
the analytic solution of this problem, i.e. of the path integral for the particle
in the box was given by Janke and Kleinert almost simultaneously [15]. Barker
also computed distribution functions for the problem of two particles in a box.
Very much in the spirit of Lawande et al. but possibly unaware of this work,
Creutz and Freedman published a didactic paper on a statistical approach to

quantum mechanics in 1981 [16]. They, too, performed Metropolis sampling of
paths in the broken line approximation and studied the energies and ground
state wave functions of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The back-
ground of these authors were Monte Carlo studies of gauge ﬁeld theories, and
the paper was meant as an attempt to better understand the Monte Carlo
method by applying it to simple one-degree-of-freedom Schr¨odinger problems.
It still is a useful introduction to the basics of the technique, and in particular it
presents a brief primer on the theory of Markov chains underlying the Metropo-
lis algorithm. To compute energies they introduced an alternative estimator by
invoking the virial theorem. They also studied double well problems, presenting
snap shot pictures of double-kink instanton paths. The problem of determining
the energy level splitting was addressed by computing correlation functions.

The papers by Lawande et al. and by Creutz and Freedman appear to have
been cited very rarely, possibly because they presented their work as being only
of pedagogic value and not so much because the Monte Carlo method could be
a useful method to obtain numerical results for Schr¨odinger problems which, in
real life, should be handled by numerical methods more suitable in this simple
case. These remarks also hold for work published a little later by Shuryak
[17, 18].

Fosdick’s work from 1962 was done very much at the forefront of the techno-
logical possibilities of high-speed computing at the time. By the mid-eighties,
path integral simulations of simple quantum mechanical problems had become
both conceptually and technically “easy.” Indeed, the exposition by Creutz
and Freedman was already written in an introductory, didactic manner, and in
1985 the simulation of the one-particle harmonic oscillator was explicitly pro-
posed as an undergraduate project, to be handled on a Commodore CBM3032
microcomputer, in a paper published in the American Journal of Physics [19].

4 Speeding up

The feasibility of evaluating the quantum statistical partition function of many-
particle systems by Monte Carlo sampling of paths was well established by the
early eighties and the method began to be applied to concrete problems, in
particular in the chemical physics literature. It had also become clear that the
method had severe restrictions if numerical accuracy was called for. In addi-
tion to the statistical error inherent to the Monte Carlo method, a systematic
error was unavoidably introduced by the necessary discretization of the paths.
Attempts to improve the accuracy by algorithmic improvements to reduce both
the systematic and the statistical errors were reported in subsequent years. The
literature is abundant and rather than trying to review the ﬁeld I shall only
indicate some pertinent paths of development.

In Fourier PIMC methods, introduced in 1983 in the chemical physics context
by Doll and Freeman [20, 21], the systematic error arises from the fact that
only a ﬁnite number of Fourier components are taken into account. Here the
systematic error could be reduced by the method of partial averaging [22, 23].

In discrete time approximations arising from the short-time propagator or,
equivalently, the high-temperature Green’s function various attempts have been
made to ﬁnd more rapidly converging formulations. Among these are attempts
to include higher terms in an expansion of the Wigner-Kirkwood type, i.e. an
expansion in terms of ¯h2/2m. Taking into account the ﬁrst term of such an
expansion would imply to replace the potential term ǫV (xj−1) in (4) by [24, 25,
26]

ǫV (xj−1) →

dyV (y).

This improves the convergence of the density matrix (4) (from even less than
O(1/L)) [24] to O(1/L2). For the full partition function, the convergence of
the simple discretization scheme is already of order O(1/L2) since due to the
cyclic property of the trace, the discretization ǫV (xj−1) is then equivalent to a
symmetrized potential term ǫ(V (xj−1) + V (xj ))/2. The convergence behaviour
of these formulations follows from the Trotter decomposition formula,

valid for non-commuting operators A and B in a Banach space [27], identifying A

More rapidly converging discretization schemes were investigated on the basis of
higher-order decompositions. Unfortunately, a direct, “fractal” decomposition

inevitably leads to negative coeﬃcients for higher decompositions [29] and is
therefore not amenable to Monte Carlo sampling of paths [30]. Higher-order
Trotter decomposition schemes involving commutators have proven to be more
successful [31, 32, 33, 34]. In particular, a decomposition of the form

eﬀective potential [32]

Another problem for the numerical accuracy of PIMC simulations arises from
the analog of the “critical slowing down” problem well-known for local update
algorithms at second-order phase transitions in the simulation of spin systems

7

and lattice ﬁeld theory. Since the correlations hxj xj+ki between variables xj
and xj+k in the discrete time approximation only depend on the temperature
and on the gaps between the energy levels and not, or at least not appreciably,
on the discretization parameter ǫ, the correlation length ζ along the discretized
time axis always diverges linearly with L when measured in units of the lattice
spacing ǫ. Hence in the continuum limit of ǫ → 0 with β ﬁxed or, equivalently,
of L → ∞ for local, importance sampling update algorithms, like the standard
Metropolis algorithm, a slowing down occurs because paths generated in the
Monte Carlo process become highly correlated. Since for simulations using the
Metropolis algorithm autocorrelation times diverge as [35] τ int
O ∝ Lz with z ≈ 2
the computational eﬀort (CPU time) to achieve comparable numerical accuracy
in the continuum limit L → ∞ diverges as L × Lz = Lz+1.

To overcome this drawback, ad hoc algorithmic modiﬁcations like introduc-
ing collective moves of the path as a whole between local Metropolis updates
were introduced then and again. One of the earliest more systematic and suc-
cessful attempts to reduce autocorrelations between successive path conﬁgu-
rations was introduced in 1984 by Pollock and Ceperly [36]. Rewriting the
discretized path integral, their method essentially amounts to a recursive trans-
formation of the variables xi in such a way that the kinetic part of the energy can
be taken care of by sampling direct Gaussian random variables and a Metropolis
choice is made for the potential part. The recursive transformation can be done
between some ﬁxed points of the discretized paths, and the method has been
applied in such a way that successively ﬁner discretizations of the path were
introduced between neighbouring points. Invoking the polymer analog of the
discretized path this method was christened the “staging” algorithm by Sprik,
Klein, and Chandler in 1985 [37].

The staging algorithm decorrelates successive paths very eﬀectively because
the whole staging section of the path is essentially sampled independently. In
1993, another explicitly non-local update was applied to PIMC simulations
[35, 38] by transferring the so-called multigrid method known from the sim-
ulation of spin systems. Originating in the theory of numerical solutions of
partial diﬀerential equations, the idea of the multigrid method is to introduce a
hierarchy of successively coarser grids in order to take into account long wave-
length ﬂuctuations more eﬀectively. Moving variables of the coarser grids then
amounts to a collective move of neighbouring variables of the ﬁner grids, and
the formulation allows to give a recursive description of how to cycle most eﬀec-
tively through the various levels of the multigrid. Particularly successful is the
so-called W-cycle. Both the staging algorithm and the multigrid W-cycle have
been shown to beat the slowing down problem in the continuum limit completely
by reducing the exponent z to z ≈ 0 [39].

Another cause of severe correlations between paths arises if the probabil-
ity density of conﬁgurations is sharply peaked with high maxima separated by
regions of very low probability density. In the statistical mechanics of spin sys-
tems this is the case at a ﬁrst-order phase transition.
In PIMC simulations
the problem arises for tunneling situations like, e.g., for a double well potential
with a high potential barrier between the two wells. In these cases, an unbiased

8

probing of the conﬁguration space becomes diﬃcult because the system tends
to get stuck around one of the probability maxima. A remedy to this problem
is to simulate an auxiliary distribution that is ﬂat between the maxima and
to recover the correct Boltzmann distribution by an appropriate reweighting of
the sample. The procedure is known under the name of umbrella sampling or
multicanonical sampling.
It was shown to reduce autocorrelations for PIMC
simulations of a single particle in a one-dimensional double well, and it can also
be combined with multigrid acceleration [40].

The statistical error associated with a Monte Carlo estimate of an observ-
able O cannot only be reduced by reducing autocorrelation times τ int
O . If the
observable can be measured with two diﬀerent estimators Ui that yield the same
i = hUii with O = limL→∞ U (L)
mean U (L)
, the estimator with the smaller vari-
ance σ2
Ui is to be preferred. Straighforward diﬀerentiation of the discretized
path integral (4) leads to an estimator of the energy that explicitly measures
the kinetic and potential parts of the energy by

In the early eighties, investigations of the “kinetic”
and the “virial” estimators focussed on their variances [41, 42, 32]. Some years
later, it was pointed out [43] that a correct assessment of the accuracy also
has to take into account the autocorrelations, and it was demonstrated that for
a standard Metropolis simulation of the harmonic oscillator the allegedly less
successful “kinetic” estimator gave smaller errors than the “virial” estimator.
In 1989 it was shown [44] that conclusions about the accuracy also depend on
the particular Monte Carlo update algorithm at hand since modiﬁcations of the
update scheme such as inclusion of collective moves of the whole path aﬀect the
autocorrelations of the two estimators in a diﬀerent way. A careful comparison
of the two estimators which disentangles the various factors involved was given
only quite recently [45]. Here it was also shown that a further reduction of
the error may be achieved by a proper combination of both estimators without
extra cost.

5 Concluding Remarks

Application of the Monte Carlo method to quantum systems is not restricted to
direct sampling of Feynman paths but this method has attractive features. It is
not only conceptually suggestive but also allows for algorithmic improvements
that help to make the method useful even when the problems at hand requires
considerable numerical accuracy. However, algorithmic improvements like the
ones alluded to above have tended to be proposed and tested mainly for simple,
one-particle systems. On the other hand, the power of the Monte Carlo method
is, of course, most welcome in those cases where analytical methods fail. For
more complicated systems, however, evaluation of the algorithms and control
of numerical accuracy is also more diﬃcult. Only recently, a comparison of the
eﬃciency of Fourier- and discrete time-path integral Monte Carlo for a cluster of
22 hydrogen molecules was presented [46]—and debated [47, 48]. Nevertheless,
path integral Monte Carlo simulations have become an essential tool for the
treatment of strongly interacting quantum systems, like, e.g., the theory of
condensed helium [49].

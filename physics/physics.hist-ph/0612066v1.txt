1 Reminiscences

Cosmology is a relatively new science in Portugal. Its ﬁrst steps can be traced back

to about 20 years ago. This means that the development of cosmology as a research

subject in Portugal has coincided with a particularly blooming period, a phase in

which cosmology has evolved from its more speculative origins into a subject with

highly predictive theories and precision measurements.

But, before we discuss the origins of cosmology in Portugal, we would better begin

by paying a visit to the ﬁrst discussions on relativity. Even though, in a passive way,

Portugal has been related to the British expedition led by Arthur Eddington which

was responsible for the measurement of the deﬂection of light in the 1919 eclipse. The

measurements were carried out at Sobral, in the northeast region of Brazil, and at the

Sundi area in Pr´ıncipe, then a Portuguese colony. That is to say, the conﬁrmation of

General Relativity occurred in two Portuguese speaking countries. In the case of the

expedition to Brazil, there had been some participation of the Brazilian astronomers,

and in what concerns the expedition to Pr´ıncipe, Eddington exchanged letters about

logistics at the Sundi area with Campos Rodrigues and Frederico Oom, respectively,

director and vice-director of the Observat´orio Astron´omico de Lisboa [1, 2].

Actually, the ﬁrst discussions about relativity in Portugal were of philosophical

nature, and are due to Leonardo Coimbra (1883-1935) from the Faculdade de Letras

da Universidade de Lisboa in 1912, on a dissertation about creationism. From then

on, in the 1920s, the discussion was conducted predominantly by mathematicians,

followed by a period of philosophical arguing and polemics about the interpretation

of speciﬁc issues within relativity in the 1930s. The ﬁrst lectures on Special and Gen-

eral Relativity in Portugal took place at the mathematics major at the Faculdade de

Ciˆencias da Universidade de Lisboa in the year 1922-1923, delivered by Ant´onio dos

Santos Lucas (1866-1939). The ﬁrst research papers on Relativity, actually on diﬀer-

ential geometry inspired by General Relativity and Uniﬁed Field Theory, are due to

Aureliano Mira Fernandes (1884-1958) from Instituto Superior T´ecnico and appeared

from 1928 till 1937 (at a rate of at least one per year) in the prestigious Italian journal

Rendiconti da Academia dei Lincei. This is a most remarkable and singular endeavour

in the scenario of the Portuguese academic life at the time. Another important name

at the time was Rui Lu´ıs Gomes, a disciple of Mira Fernandes who published in the

Rendiconti da Academia dei Lincei a paper about the Special Theory of Relativity

2

and created at the Faculdade de Ciˆencias da Universidade do Porto, a theoretical

physics seminar, which was the ﬁrst organized attempt to set up, in a concerted fash-

ion, theoretical physics in Portugal. In 1930, in order to fulﬁll the requirement of
the examination for professorship at the University of Coimbra‡, Manuel dos Reis

(1900 - 1992), an astronomer and mathematician, wrote an inﬂuential monograph, O

Problema da Gravita¸c˜ao Universal, where gravity and relativity were discussed in an

historical perspective [3]. During the academic year of 1930-1931, M´ario Silva (1901-

1977), who obtained a Ph.D. with Mme. Curie and was back to Coimbra in that

year, declared his intention “to launch a discussion within the tiny Coimbra scientiﬁc

community ... on some new doctrines such as the quantum and relativity theories”

and which involved Manuel dos Reis. These discussions would lead to the ﬁrst public

confrontation between anti and pro-relativists in the country. The polemics took place

in the journal Seara Nova (New Grain Field) and involved M´ario Silva and Admiral
Gago Coutinho§, who had heard Einstein lectures in Brazil in 1925 and attended the

lectures of Paul Langevin in Lisbon in late 1929, but could not accept or understand

some of the kinematic implications of Special Relativity. Other pro-relativistic texts
appeared in the cultural journal O Diabo (The Devil) by Abel Salazar¶ [3]. Inﬂu-

ential textbooks on electromagnetism and special relativity appeared in the second

half of the 1940s by M´ario Silva [4] from Coimbra and Ant´onio da Silveira (1904-

1985) [5] from Instituto Superior T´ecnico. From the 1940 to the 1960s, the central

ﬁgure in relativity and cosmology in Portugal was Ant´onio Gi˜ao from the Faculdade

de Ciˆencias da Universidade de Lisboa and Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciˆencias. Gi˜ao

has exchanged letters with Einstein, published papers on relativity and cosmology

in the Physical Review [6, 7] and organized a NATO cosmology meeting in 1963,

which had among the participants, Pascual Jordan, Yves Thiry, Hermann Bondi and

others [8]. To this scarce, but regular interest in relativity, followed a quiet period

till the Revolu¸c˜ao dos Cravos in 25th of April 1974, when a military coup restored

democracy in Portugal after almost 50 years of dictatorship. Since then, the universi-

ties and the academic life have undergone profound transformations. The university

‡The University of Coimbra is the oldest in the country. It was established through a decree by

King Dom Dinis and conﬁrmed by the pope Nicolau IV in 9 of August of 1290.

§Admiral Gago Coutinho (1869-1959) and the airman Artur de Sacadura Cabral (1880-1924),
were the ﬁrst men to cross the South Atlantic in a non-stop ﬂight from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro in
1922.

¶Abel Salazar (1889-1946) was a physician, scientist, author and artist who lived in Porto and

was an inﬂuential ﬁgure in the Portuguese cultural life from 1920s onward.

population has, since then, grown about eight-fold and academic standards have im-
proved considerably, despite the still rather limited resourcesk. Interest in relativity

has awakened again in the mid 1970s and a course on General Relativity was then

delivered by the French physicist Maurice Bazin based on the textbook of which he

is a co-author [9] at the Faculdade de Ciˆencias da Universidade de Lisboa. Subse-

quently, courses were delivered in the same faculty by Ant´onio Brotas from Instituto

Superior T´ecnico in late 1970s [10]. The ﬁrst course on Relativity, which included

also Cosmology was delivered by Paulo Crawford do Nascimento in autumn/winter

semester of 1983 in the physics course in the Faculdade de Ciˆencias da Universidade

de Lisboa. In Instituto Superior T´ecnico, the ﬁrst Relativity and Cosmology course

was held by this author to students of the Physics and Mathematics Departments

in the spring/summer semester of 1993. About the same time, cosmology lectures

started being held by Paulo Gali Macedo at the Universidade do Porto. Since then,

lectures on General Relativity and Cosmology have been regularly held in these three

universities, both at undergradute and graduate levels.

The ﬁrst papers on cosmology were written in Portugal about 20 years ago. The

ﬁrst ones were solo ﬂights by Alfredo Barbosa Henriques concerning higher dimen-

sional cosmological models [11], by Estelita Vaz on Bianchi-type spaces [12] and a

more mathematical work by Maria Helena Bugalho, Amaro Rica da Silva and Jos´e

Sousa Ramos on chaos on a Bianchi-IX cosmological model [13]. Three papers ap-

peared in the following year, another one by Alfredo Barbosa Henriques in collabora-

tion with Gordon Moorhouse [14], a paper by Paulo Crawford Nascimento in collabo-

ration with Rubem Mondaini on anisotropic universes and inﬂation [15] and a paper

by Maria Helena Bugalho on cosmologies with a non-Abelian two-parameter isome-

try group [16]. In this period, research activities were carried out at the Instituto

de F´ısica e Matem´atica, now Complexo Multidisciplinar da Universidade de Lisboa

at Avenida Gama Pinto, 2, a multidisciplinary and multi-university research insti-

tute which encompassed researchers in atomic and nuclear physics, condensed matter

physics, ﬁeld theory, particle physics and mathematics, from the three Lisbon uni-

versities: Universidade de Lisboa, Universidade T´ecnica de Lisboa and Universidade

Nova de Lisboa. The institute existed since the 1960s and was founded by Ant´onio

da Silveira, funded initially by the Instituto da Alta Cultura, a government ﬁnancing

kEven at present, the fraction of the GNP allocated to research and development does not exceed

about 0.8%, one of the lowest of the European Union.

institution of cultural and scientiﬁc activities, and later on by the Instituto Nacional

de Investiga¸c˜ao Cient´ıﬁca (INIC), a national research foundation which existed till

1992. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a convergence of people coming

from abroad with a wide range of interests including cosmology. The mathematical

physicist Roger Picken had been in the institute since 1987. This author did arrive

from a post-doctoral experience in Heidelberg to work at the Instituto de F´ısica e

Matem´atica in October 1989 with a post-doctoral fellowship from Grupo Te´orico de

Altas Energias; Jos´e Mour˜ao arrived in 1990 after completing his Ph. D. studies in

Moscow and so did Maria da Concei¸c˜ao Bento, who came from a post-doctoral period

at London. The four of us were in the early 1990s hired as lecturers at Instituto Supe-

rior T´ecnico at the Mathematics and Physics Departments. Together with two young

Ph. D. students, Paulo Moniz and Paulo S´a and a M. Sc. student, Lu´ıs Mendes, it

was possible to organize a weekly seminar in cosmology, to build a preprint library

and to create an environment where various problems of cosmology could be tack-

led and discussed. These included, for instance, solutions of the Einstein-Yang-Mills

system (classical [17], wormhole-like [18] and quantum cosmological [19]), Kantowski-

Sachs cosmological models [20], Bianchi IX models [21], symmetry breaking in curved

spacetime [22] and string cosmology [23]. By 1993, Jos´e Pedro Mimoso [24] was back

to Faculdade de Ciˆencias of the Universidade de Lisboa after completing his Ph. D.

in Sussex.

The other major center of activity in cosmology in Portugal is Porto where the ﬁrst

papers to appear were on bounds for the Jordan-Thiry scalar ﬁeld coupling constant

by Paulo Gali Macedo [25], on the Sunyaev-Zeldovich eﬀect and its cosmological

implications [26] in 1996 by Domingos Barbosa and co-authors, on cosmic strings

[27] in 1997 by Pedro Avelino and co-authors and, on galaxy cluster abundance and

cosmological parameters [28] in 1999 by Pedro Viana and Andrew Liddle. More

recently, Carlos Herdeiro and Miguel Costa and Carlos Martins have joined the group

and enriched the list of research subjects to include G¨odel type universes [29], string

cosmology [30] and cosmic strings [31] to mention just a few.

The other groups, although smaller, are no less relevant. The group at Universi-

dade do Minho, got established in the early 1980s after Estelita Vaz came back from

her Ph. D. in Britain. The group at the Universidade do Algarve was established in

the early 1990s by Cenalo Vaz and Robertus Potting [32], the former now gone to the

US, and Paulo S´a joined the group in 1995 [33]. The group at the Universidade da

5

Beira Interior was established by Paulo Moniz in the late 1990s [34] and Jos´e Velhinho

joined him in 2000 [35].

2 Current Trends

Currently, research in cosmology in Portugal is carried out in 6 out of the 12 state
Universities∗∗. They are the following, where we indicate within parenthesis the name

of the researchers:

Universidade do Algarve at Faro (Paulo S´a and Robertus Potting)

Universidade da Beira Interior at Covilh˜a (Paulo Moniz and Jos´e Velhinho)

Universidade de ´Evora (Il´ıdio Lopes)

Faculdade de Ciˆencias da Universidade de Lisboa (Luis Bento, Paulo Crawford, Tom

Girard and Jos´e Pedro Mimoso and Ana Nunes)

Instituto Superior T´ecnico of the Universidade T´ecnica de Lisboa (Maria da Concei¸c˜ao

Bento, Orfeu Bertolami, Alfredo Barbosa Henriques and Ana Mour˜ao)

Universidade do Minho at Braga and Guimar˜aes (Filipe Mena, Piedade Ramos and

Estelita Vaz)

Faculdade de Ciˆencias da Universidade do Porto (Pedro Avelino, Miguel Costa, Paulo

Carvalho, Carlos Herdeiro, Catarina Lobo, Paulo Gali Macedo, F´atima Mota, Caro-

line Santos and Pedro Viana)

Quite often, the research is developed in Physics Departments, but also at Applied

Math Departments in the case of the Universidade do Porto and Universidade do

Minho. However, formally, and this is a well marked feature of science activities in

Portugal, research activities take place in the context of research centers which are

related with the universities, but have some administrative independence and some

freedom to guide research interests and their development. Cosmology is a research

topic in 8 centers. Their spread within the above mentioned universities is as follows:

Faculdade de Ciˆencias da Universidade de Lisboa:

Centro de Astronomia e Astrof´ısica da Universidade de Lisboa (CAAUL)

Centro de F´ısica Nuclear (CFN)

∗∗The public sector also comprises about 25 polytechnic institutions.

6

Centro de F´ısica Te´orica e Computacional (CFTC).

Instituto Superior T´ecnico (IST):

Centro Multidisciplinar de Astrof´ısica (CENTRA)

Centro de F´ısica dos Plasmas (CFPl)

Centro de F´ısica Te´orica e Part´ıculas (CFTP).

Faculdade de Ciˆencias da Universidade do Porto:

Centro de Astrof´ısica da Universidade de Porto (CAUP)

Centro de F´ısica do Porto (CFP).

Besides the above mentioned researchers, an important feature of the Portuguese

scientiﬁc community working in cosmology is that it is relatively young and that

a great deal of activity is carried out by young researchers, post-docs and Ph.D.

students. There are about 17 post-docs and their distribution around the country is

as follows: 1 in Faro, 11 in Lisbon, 5 in Porto and there are 6 Portuguese post-docs

abroad (indicated with *), some willing to come back within a period of 1 to 3 years.

Let me name them:

Tiago Barreiro, Domingos Barbosa, Jarle Brinchmann, Carla Carvalho, Tiago Char-

ters, Morgan Le Delliou, Vikram Duvvuri, S´ebastien Fabbro, Pedro C. Ferreira, Fran-

cisco Lobo, Carlos Martins, Luis Mendes*, David Mota*, Rui Neves, Nelson Nunes*,

Jorge P´aramos, Gra¸ca Rocha, M´ario Santos, Nuno Santos*, Ant´onio Silva, Pedro

Silva, Ricardo Schiappa*, Luis Teodoro*.

There are also about 13 Ph. D. students: 1 in Faro, 5 in Lisbon and 7 in Porto.

Let me name them:

Vladan Arsenivejic, Luis Be¸ca, Catarina Bastos, Lu´ıs Costa, Rosa Doran, Jo˜ao Fer-

nandes, Josinaldo Menezes, Joana Oliveira, Carmen Rebelo, Ismael Tereno, Brigitte

Tom´e, Paulo Torres, Pedro Vieira.

Currently, the research in cosmology in Portugal covers the major areas of interest,

which includes quantum cosmology, strings and brane cosmology, inﬂation, cosmic

microwave background radiation, cosmic strings, cosmological phase transitions and

cosmology in the laboratory, dark matter, dark energy, variation of fundamental

couplings, spacetime symmetries and topology and observational cosmology.

In many of these subjects, papers written in Portugal have reached a position of

visibility, having more than 50 and 100 citations according to the QSPIRES database.

7

Among those, one could mention, for instance, papers on baryogenesis [40], cosmo-

logical and astrophysical aspects of the of Lorentz symmetry breaking [41, 42], dark

energy [43, 44, 45, 46, 47], inﬂation [48] and the variation of fundamental constants

[49, 50, 51]. Papers on Lorentz symmetry breaking and gravity [52] and on dark en-

ergy [53] have been awarded 3rd Prizes by the Gravity Research Foundation in U.S.,

in 1999 and 2005. A paper on dark matter has been awarded the Prize Uni˜ao Latina

de Ciˆencia in 2001 [54].

It is quite exciting that this quality recognition can also be found in papers on

observational cosmology and data analysis, such as, for instance, on the Sunyaev-

Zeldovich eﬀect and its implications for cosmology [55], on constraints on the matter

power spectrum normalization using SDSS/RASS and reﬂex cluster survey [56] and

on supernova survey and cosmological parameters [57]. It is also quite remarkable

the Portuguese involvement on the team that has identiﬁed the oldest cluster ever

observed, with z = 1.45, in the context of the XMM cluster survey [58].

These papers indicate that, recently, there has been a serious involvement of the

Portuguese cosmology community on observational activities. The most salient are

the following:

Galactic Emission Mapping (Building a radio telescope for studying the foreground

of the galactic synchrotron emission) (CENTRA)

Planck Surveyor (CENTRA-Working Group 7, CAUP-Working Group 5)

Square Kilometer Array (CENTRA)

Supernova Cosmology Project and Supernova Legacy Survey (CENTRA)

XMM-Newton Cluster Survey (CAUP)

Pioneer Anomaly and LATOR (Laser Astrometric Test of Relativity) Science Teams

(CFPl)

We can also mention the involvement of the community on recent publications

aiming to raise the public awareness on cosmology and, in particular, on the work

8

developed in Portugal:

Descobrir o Universo, Teresa Lago et al. (Ed. Gradiva, April 2006).

O Livro das Escolhas C´osmicas, Orfeu Bertolami (Ed. Gradiva, January 2006).

To these books, we can add the chapter on cosmology written by Jos´e Pedro Mimoso

which appeared in the book O C´odigo Secreto (Ed. Gradiva) by Margarida Telo da

Gama et al. in 2005.

Portugal has been also the stage of many international conferences on cosmology.

Indeed, since the 1990s, conferences have been taken place in Portugal on a regular

basis. The most attended include:

3 The Future: Aspirations and Challenges

It is clear that cosmology has undergone an impressive development in Portugal in

the ﬁrst two decades of its history. However, despite this growth, there are serious

concerns about the will of the institutions to keep up this positive trend in the future.

The reasons are manifold, the most noticeable being:

i) The university and the national laboratory systems are still too opaque and has

shown no clear signs that they are able and willing to absorb the young generation

via fresh job positions and to create intellectually stimulating research spaces.

In

our opinion, the creation of stable positions for the young generation of researchers

should be a top priority. Furthermore, several structural changes must be promoted

so that careers are regulated by criteria of excellence and not by “Monte Carlo”

methods ... That is to say, a radical change is urgently needed in the criteria of access

and promotion for the university and research positions. Emphasis on creativity,

innovation and mobility within institutions must be implemented as soon as possible

so as to avoid a brain drain problem.

ii) It is unclear whether the cosmology community will be able to rely on a regular

and continuous support from the existing institutions (Minist´erio da Ciˆencia, Tec-

nologia e Ensino Superior, Funda¸c˜ao para a Ciˆencia e a Tecnologia and so on) given

budgetary diﬃculties arising from restrictions by the European Monetary Fund, eco-

nomic performance and so on. Furthermore, ﬁnancial support is often incipient and

too conditioned by changes of political nature.

We think that it is uncontroversial to state that it would be beneﬁcial for the com-

munity to count on with a national laboratory devoted to Astronomy, Astrophysics

and Cosmology given that there are no astronomy departments in the country. Of

course, an institution of this nature should concentrate various competences such

as, for instance, the ones associated with data storage, computational facilities and

hardware support. A national laboratory would also help to strengthen the spirit of

10

the community as well as the ties with the existing ﬁnancing institutions and could

open up new forms of collaboration with private institutions and individuals. Finally,

we feel that it is important to stress that, despite all the diﬃculties, the cosmology

community in Portugal can realistically aim to establish its position in the league of

the top 5 strongest in Europe. The assessment of the ﬁrst 20 years of development

indicates that this is quite within reach, however this goal can only be achieved if we

can ensure, through our concerted action, the long term success of the portuguese

cosmology community and if conditions are created for the settling and blooming

within our institutions of the young generation of researchers. It would be a waste if

the country could not make proper use of the existing talents.

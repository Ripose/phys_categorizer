We study the theory of the (1/2, 0) ⊕ (0, 1/2) and (1, 0) ⊕ (0, 1) representations in the helicity
basis. The helicity eigenstates are not the parity eigenstates. This is in accordance with the idea of
Berestetski˘ı, Lifshitz and Pitaevski˘ı. The behaviour of the helicity eigenstates with respect to the
charge conjugation, CP - conjugation is also diﬀerent comparing with the parity eigenstates.

I. INTRODUCTION.

Recently we generalized the Dirac formalism [1–4] and the Bargmann-Wigner formalism [5–7]. On this basis we
proposed a set of equations for antisymmetric tensor (AST) ﬁeld. Some of them imply parity-violating transitions. In
this paper we are going to study transformations from the standard basis to the helicity basis in the Dirac theory and in
(0, 1) Sankaranarayanan-Good theory [8,9]. The spin basis rotation changes properties of the corresponding
the (1, 0)
states with respect to parity. The parity is a physical quantum number; so, we try to extract corresponding physical
contents from considerations of the various spin bases.

⊕

Beginning the consideration of the helicity basis, we observe that it is well known that the operator ˆS3 = σ3/2
I2
does not commute with the Dirac Hamiltonian unless the 3-momentum is aligned along with the third axis and the
plane-wave expansion is used:

Moreover, Berestetski˘ı, Lifshitz and Pitaevski˘ı wrote [10]: “... the orbital angular momentum l and the spin s of
a moving particle are not separately conserved. Only the total angular momentum j = l + s is conserved. The
component of the spin in any ﬁxed direction (taken as z-axis is therefore also not conserved, and cannot be used to
enumerate the polarization (spin) states of moving particle.” The similar conclusion has been given by Novozhilov in
p
his book [11]. On the other hand, the helicity operator σ
, commutes with the Hamiltonian (more

precisely, the commutator is equal to zero when acting on the one-particle plane-wave solutions).

So, it is a bit surprising, why the 4-spinors have been studied so well when the basis have been chosen in such a

2This opposes to the choice of the basis (2), where 4-spinors are the eigenstates of the parity operator.

for the study of the massless limit.

in the helicity basis with respect to P , C and CP operations.

Let us start from the Klein-Gordon equation written for the 3-component function (¯h = c = 1):

The function ψ describe the particles, which is usually referred as spin 1; we refer to it as a “3-spinor”. On choosing

In the coordinate space it is of the second order in the time derivative, but as in the spin-1/2 case [17] we can reduce
it to the set of the 3-“spinor” equations of the ﬁrst orders. The procedure permits us to consider the hamiltonian-like
form i¯h ∂ψ

Thus, from what we have seen above, we can conclude that the Duﬃn-Kemmer-Petiau, Proca, Weinberg and Tucker-
Hammer equations are all related one another. They can be obtained by various transformations from the relativistic
dispersion relation, E2

p2 = m2.

6We should mention that this procedure is not quite clear, because the dispersion relations of the Weinberg equation and
the Tucker-Hammer equation may be diﬀerent (see [21]). The Weinberg equation permits, in general, the tachyonic solutions,

Now we study the discrete symmetry operations for spin-1 case (as we did for spin-1/2 case in the previous Section).

The bivectors have the following properties:

1. The Parity (p

We found within the classical ﬁeld theory that the properties of particle and anti-particle of spin-1 are diﬀerent
comparing with the known cases (when the basis is chosen in such a way that the solutions are the eigenstates of the
parity).

P and C operations anticommute in this framework on the classical level.

The diﬀerent formulations of the spin-1 particles are all connected by algebraic transformations.

The properties of spin-1 solutions in the helicity basis with respect to P , C, CP are similar to those in the
spin-1/2 case.

In order to make the above conclusions to be more ﬁrm one should repeat the calculations in the Fock space within

the “secondary quantization” framework (see [17] for the spin-1/2 case).

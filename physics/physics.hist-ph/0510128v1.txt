Abstract

For readers interested in the history of chiral symmetry we present the
translation of two papers from 1955 and 1959 from German to English, in
which chiral symmetry properties for weak and strong interactions have
been postulated and discussed.

1

Chiral symmetry is one of the fundamental properties of the theory of par-
ticle physics. It requires invariance of the Lagrangian under independent global
transformations of left and right handed fermion ﬁelds. For a single particle gen-
eration, the standard model Lagrangian of particle physics, with its electroweak
and strong gauge and Yukawa interactions, has this symmetry. This holds also
in natural extensions of the standard model, the grand uniﬁed theories, such
as SO(10) and E6. For several generations the Yukawa interaction is no more
invariant, but chiral symmetry can be restored, if a generation symmetry is built
into the model. The fermion masses then arise from the spontaneous breaking
of chiral and generation symmetry.

For some readers it may therefore be of interest to look at the very ﬁrst sug-
gestions of chiral symmetry published many years ago. For their convenience
we translate here from German to English the two original papers dealing with
chiral symmetry for weak and strong interactions, published in Zeitschrift f¨ur
Physik in 1955 1 and 1959 2 respectively. The fact that they have been written
in German may be the reason why they are less known than later papers on
this subject. In the translation we tried to be as close as possible to the orig-
inals. In the ﬁrst paper, chiral symmetry of the weak interaction Lagrangian
was postulated in the form of a γ5 symmetry. Because this paper was written
before Lee and Yang suggested the existence of parity changing processes, the
symmetry operation consisted of the simultaneous replacement of two fermion
ﬁeld operators by γ5 times these ﬁelds. After the discovery of parity changing
transitions, the extension of the symmetry by simply transforming each fermion
ﬁeld separately with γ5 became possible. The corresponding invariance require-
ment led immediately to the unique and well-known chirality invariant form of
the weak interaction.

The suggestion that chiral symmetry could also be a symmetry of the strong
interaction, even though this interaction is parity conserving, was made in the
second paper we translate here. To our knowledge it was the ﬁrst paper prov-
ing that chiral invariance could also be a property of the strong interaction
Lagrangian. A non-linear square root type meson-nucleon coupling served for
this purpose. Today, one uses for the eﬀective interaction with the pion ﬁeld
a more convenient expression with the meson ﬁeld in the exponent. In both
papers presented here chiral symmetry is valid for the interactions, but is still
violated by the mass terms in the free part of the Lagrangian. It is a symmetry
”as if the masses were zero”. Only later this deﬁciency could be removed with
an improved form of the eﬀective Lagrangian for mesons and baryons and, for
the basic theory, by generating the fermion masses using the Higgs mechanism.

By only using data about β decay (not µ meson decay) the restrictions in the choice of
the coupling constants well secured by experiment are discussed. After that two “a priori”
arguments will be described where one of them yields the alternative: (ST P ) or (V A). The
other “a priori” argument determines the exact value of the coeﬃcients, namely: S
T + P
and V

Introduction.

The theory of β decay is still suﬀering from the ambiguity of the possible ans¨atze
for the interaction operator, even if one restricts oneself to a point interaction of
the four fermions participating in the process. The most obvious ansatz would
be a simple scalar one for the interaction operator

W = U + U ∗ with U = g · S

(1)

where S stands for the abbreviation

S = ( ¯ψp · ψn)( ¯ϕe · ϕν).
(2)
Here g is a constant measuring the coupling of the four fermion ﬁelds; ¯ψ = ψ†γ4,
where ψ† is the hermitean conjugate spinor and ψp, ψn, ψe, ψν are the ﬁeld func-
tions (operators) of proton, neutron, electron and neutrino, respectively. Such
an ansatz is not suﬃcient to describe all β processes since this interaction ansatz
implies that the emerging proton is of the same spinor type as the disappearing
neutron. Thus, the spin of the nucleon could not ﬂip in the β process. How-
ever, the experimental data reveal that β processes with spin ﬂip occur with
approximately the same probability as those in which the nucleon keeps its spin
orientation2. Therefore it is necessary to take into account the possibility of
such spin ﬂip processes in the ansatz for the interaction. For allowed transi-
tions and in a non-relativistic description of the nucleons, this happens in the
generalization suggested by Gamow and Teller:

U = gF S + gGG
(3)
with S as above, and G = ( ¯ψp~σψn)( ¯ϕe~σϕν) where ~σ is Pauli’s resp. Dirac’s
spin vector operator.

A somewhat simpler description of this case is obtained using an ansatz for the interaction
in which in each scalar spinor product a heavy and a light particle are grouped together, e. g.

Here the spin of the emerging nucleon is not coupled any more to the spin of the disappearing
nucleon, and already a simple scalar ansatz of the type (4) contains both Fermi and Gamow-
Teller transitions. We will come back to this later in
3. For the time being we shall use
§
the traditional teminology.

For the general discussion including “forbidden” transitions it is necessary
to treat also the nucleons relativistically since relativistic terms of the nucleons
contribute to the “forbidden” transitions to the same order of magnitude as the
ﬁnite ratio of the spatial extension of the nucleon ﬁelds to the wave lengths of
the electron and neutrino states. The most general relativistic invariant ansatz
for a point interaction is, cf. Konopinski, 1.c. – (in the following we will write
for the ﬁeld functions of the particles simply the particle symbol : n for ψn and
accordingly p for ψp, e for ψe, and ν for ψν) – :

U = gSS + gV V + gT T + gAA + gP P

For the product γ1γ2γ3γ4 we write as usual γ5. The single round brackets
transform as a scalar in S, as a four vector in V , as an antisymmetric tensor in

The fundamental problem of the theory of β decay is the ﬁnding of ex-
perimental rules or of theoretical arguments restricting the choice of the ﬁve
coupling constants gS, gV , gT , gA, gP and determining them unambiguously.

The reality of the coupling constants is guaranteed by the requirement that the interac-
tion ansatz should be invariant by simultaneously rewriting all four fermions into their anti
particles3 4.

The theoretical “a priori principles” previously suggested to give restrictions
for the choice of g′s — (they are discussed in Konopinski and Langer l.c.
elaborately) —, have lead to results that contradict the experimental results.

Peaslee5 gives an analysis of the experimental results, according to which a combination
gT = gP and gV = gA = 0, is not in contradiction with any experi-

mental result. He then discusses a theoretical selection principle which is in accordance with
this combination. However his principle is based on a special relation6 between β processes

and µ meson decay which ﬁxes the spectrum of the decay electrons of the µ meson – (the
spectrum goes to zero at the maximum electron energy). But according to the most precise
measurements7 the spectrum has a ﬁnite value at the energy boundary.

In the present article we like to summarize the consequences for the interac-
tion ansatz resulting from experiments restricted to β processes and to search
for and to discuss the simplest “theoretical” principles which are in accordance
with the empirical results and tighten them.

§1. A simple restriction for the coeﬃcients in the interaction ansatz

The alternative statement with the best experimental conﬁrmation reads, cf.
Konopinski and Langer, 1. c.

either one has

or

gV = gA = 0

gS = gT = gP = 0.

(7a)

(7b)

In other words: there can either be a (ST P ) combination or a (V A) com-
bination8. This statement is aﬃrmed by precise measurements of electron and
positron spectra of allowed and forbidden transitions9. Of course, the exact
vanishing of the relevant groups of g coeﬃcients cannot be extracted from ex-
periments. However, one would certainly come to a contradiction with the
measured spectra if the absolute value of one of the g factors having been set
to zero would be bigger than 1/10 of the value of the biggest g coeﬃcient of
those having not been set to zero. This is a careful estimation, probably one
can conclude that the corresponding g values must be even closer to zero.

There exists a very simple theoretical argument that provides exactly the

alternative expressed in (7). First it may be formulated quite formally:

One requires that the interaction (5) – except for a sign – will transform into
itself if one performs simultaneously the replacement (e and ν denote, as above,
the ﬁeld functions):

e → γ5e

ν → γ5ν.

(9)

One ﬁnds from a quite elementary calculation that under the given replace-
ment V and A transform into themselves while S, T and P change their sign:

(γ5eγλγ5ν) = (eγλν)
(γ5eγ5ν) = −(eν)

and accordingly for the terms in A,

and accordingly for the terms in T and P .

Rev. 96, 1159 (1954). – Vilain, J. H. and W. Williams: Phys. Rev. 94, 1011 (1954).

8The notation (AV ) etc. means that at least one of the coeﬃcients g of the terms in
brackets are not equal to zero while the g factors of the terms not appearing in the brackets
vanish.

9This is equivalent with the absence of all so-called “Fierz terms” in the spectrum,

Konopinski and Langer, 1. c.

The requirement of invariance under this transformation excludes therefore

that (V A) can appear together with (ST P ) in the interaction operator.

With respect to the physical interpretation of the transformation (9) it may
be pointed out that the replacement of ψ by γ5ψ is equivalent to the replacement
of m by −m in the Dirac equation, for from

If the electron would have, like the neutrino, a vanishing rest mass then, with
e being a solution of the Dirac equation, γ5e would be a solution as well. The
ﬁnite value of the rest mass of the electron is probably irrelevant for the general
form of the interaction operator. Thus it can make good sense to require: “The
interaction operator should have the same general form as if the rest mass of
the electron would be zero.” But then the invariance of the interaction operator
under the transformation (9) is an almost compelling requirement10.

One still could tighten this selection principle in the following sense. If one presumes that
the β interaction operator has the same form as for four diﬀerent fermions which all have a
vanishing rest mass, then one could require the invariance of the interaction operator under
the simultaneous replacement of every arbitrary pair of ﬁeld functions ψ by γ5ψ; so e. g. also
for e
γ5p. With this strict requirement the only combinations possible would
be:

will discuss an invariance requirement more plausible to us having consequences which are in

accord with the selections mentioned just now, but tighten this selection even further.

For the following we will only stress on the existence of the experimentally
well established alternative (7) and the fact that one can obtain it from a very
little incisive theoretical requirement.

§2. Fixing the coeﬃcients in the interaction ansatz

The statement (7) is still very general since it states nothing about the relative
magnitude of the coeﬃcients in the combination (ST P ) and in (V A) respec-
tively. Before coming to this point we will ﬁrst quote additional experimental
ﬁndings.

From the measurements of f · t values of some speciﬁc allowed transitions
it can be concluded, cf. especially 11 and 12, that |gG/gF | is close to 1. This
10The invariance of the interaction operator under the γ5 transformation of the electron and
neutrino states has the consequence that all terms linear in the electron mass (“Fierz terms”)
in the spectrum vanish. In Peaslee 1. c. a γ5 invariance for two undistinguishable neutrinos
in µ decay has been required. Only in this case the requirement of invariance including the
sign suggests itself.

implies for the case of a (ST P ) interaction that |gT /gS| ≈ 1 and for the case of
a (V A) interaction |gA/gV | ≈ 1. On the other hand, the ratio gP /gS is within
a large range undetermined.

Now we would like to point out that the special combinations

either
or

gS = −gT = gP
gA = −gV

and gA = gV = 0,
and gS = gT = gP = 0,

i. e.: S − T + P

i. e.: A − V,

follow from a very simple isotropy requirement. From the known general for-
mulae obtained for the angular correlation of β-decay13 it follows that for
|gS| = |gT | and gV = gA = 0 or for |gV | = |gA| and gS = gT = gP = 0
there is no angular correlation between electron and the neutrino in the decay
of the free neutron14. This can be understood from a plausible general isotropy
requirement, if one describes the β decay, as usual, by the annihilation of two
particles (neutron and neutrino) and the creation of two others (proton and elec-
tron)15. In a reference frame, in which the neutron and the vanishing neutrino
(which is in a state of negative energy) have opposite momenta and thus total
momentum zero, no direction is preferred and the following requirement seems
plausible: “In this reference frame the distribution of the direction of the emitted
protons should be isotropic”. Since the electrons have the opposite momenta of
the protons in this reference frame, also the distribution of the directions of the
electrons will then be isotropic.

§3. Consequences of the isotropy requirement

One can overlook the consequences of this isotropy requirement best in a rep-
resentation of the interaction operator diﬀering from the usual one, namely, in
which in analogy with the expression (4), each nucleon is coupled with one of the
light particles. In this case the two annihilated, and the two created fermions as
well, can be combined to form Lorentz covariant expressions. For this purpose
it is necessary to introduce the so-called conjugate spinors, cf. e. g. Pais and
Jost 1. c. These are deﬁned as follows: To every spinor ψ a conjugate spinor
ψC is deﬁned by the following relation:

ψC = C ¯ψT .

(11)

The meaning of ¯ψ is given above near eq. (1), T shall indicate the transposition,
i. e. the interchange of columns and rows. The unitary transformation matrix
C is ﬁxed by the following properties16

The isotropy requirement discussed at the end of §2 now says that the interaction
potential

– applied to a process in which neutron and neutrino have opposite momenta –
is invariant under an arbitrary rotation of the electron and proton directions.

Thus, the replacement

eC → ΛeC,

where Λ denotes the transformation matrix18 acting on the spinor components
should leave U unchanged. (The momentum conservation insures that the ex-
ponential functions of the plane waves do not have to be considered). Because
of the known transformation properties of the vector, tensor etc. combinations
the invariance holds only for

aV = aT = aA = 0

(16)

e.i. only the “scalar” and “pseudoscalar” expressions ˜S and ˜P can contribute
to the interaction. From (13) one has now the strict requirement that U can

Taking the alternative (7) into account then

either U = −g(S − T + P ) = 2g( ˜S + ˜P )
or

U = −g(V − A) = 2g( ˜S − ˜P )

(17a)
(17b)

are the only possible forms for the interaction.

It shall be pointed out, that the alternative (7) is only needed in the weak form gSgV =
gT gA = 0 (i. e. that V cannot appear together with S and that A cannot appear together with
T ). This, however, is well established experimentally, because it can already be concluded
from the precisely measured spectra of allowed transitions 19.

In the formulation of the isotropy principle a reference system was used,
in which under rotations only the spinor components are transformed. There-
fore, one can interpret the “isotropy” as a decoupling of the spin orientations
of the created particles from the spin orientation of the annihilated particles.
This point of view can also be formulated quantitatively: For free particles the
Hamilton operator commutes20 with (~σ · ~p) and thus commutes for particles
with a ﬁxed momentum direction with (~σ · ~e), if the unit vector ~e points in
the momentum direction. This operator is the operator of an inﬁnitesimal spin
rotation around the momentum vector. If one now requires the invariance of
the interaction operator U under such spin rotations of the created particles,
keeping the spins of the annihilated particles ﬁxed,

¯p → ¯p(~σ~e)

and

e → −(~σ~e)e,

i. e.

eC → (~σ~e)eC ,

(18)

then only such relativistic invariants can contribute to the interaction ansatz
(14), which contains γ combinations commuting with (~σ~e). Commuting with
(~σ~e), however, are only 1 and γ5. Also in this way one ﬁnds the result (16).
The latter leads in non-relativistic approximation (for the heavy particles) to
|gF | = |gG| and reveals here again and clearly the decoupling of neutron and
proton spin: spin ﬂip and non-spin ﬂip processes have the same probability.

The result (16) (aV = aT = aA = 0) which has been obtained with the help of the
isotropy requirement is also in accord with the requirement of invariance (up to the sign) of
the part of the interaction operator containing the created (or the annihilated) particles alone
under the particle-antiparticle conjugation21. One ﬁnds using the deﬁnition22

P C (ψ1Ωψ2) = (ψC

1 )
P C (peC ) = (epC ) =
−
P C (pγ5eC ) = (eγ5pC ) =

(pγ5eC ).

−

However, since the corresponding requirements as well as the one for time
reversal separately for created and annihilated particles seems not very plausible,
we dispense from deriving our result (16) from such conditions.

Note added in proof. Both interaction ans¨atze (17a) (S − T + P ) and (17b)
(A − V ) are antisymmetric by interchanging either the created particles among

themselves or the annihilated particles among themselves as a simple calcula-
tion shows, cf. also Peaslee 1. c., Caianiello 1. c. and Pursey23. This
restricted part of the general antisymmetry requirement discussed by Critch-
field and Wigner24 is therefore compatible with our isotropy requirement
discussed above. The isotropy requirement, however, is more restrictive. The
requirement of antisymmetry under the interchange of the created or the dis-
appearing particles would also allow the combination25 S − A − P which is not
compatible with the isotropy requirement and the experimental ﬁndings.

The antisymmetry requirement for the “created particles” together with the
invariance under the substitution (9) is, however, equivalent with the isotropy
requirement together with the invariance postulate (9).

§4. The S − T + P interaction

A theoretical decision in favor of or against one of the two possibilities presented
in (17), diﬀering in the new representation only by a sign, has not yet been
accomplished. Thus, at this place only a discussion of the experimental results
is possible. Especially important to us are the recoil measurements in β decay
of He6 that have been performed by Rustard and Ruby, 1. c. and by Allen
and Jentschke, 1. c. These measurements show that T is an essential part of
the β interaction operator. They exclude the combination (17b). This ﬁnding
is in agreement with earlier evidences by Nordheim26 and Peaslee, 1. c. that
P is likely a part of the interaction.

If one accepts this alternative and the theoretical selection principles put
forward, then β decay is a S − T + P interaction which, in a new notation, takes
the simple form

U = 2g( ˜S + ˜P ) = 2g{(νCn)(peC) + (νC γ5n)(pγ5eC)}.

(19)

One can see that the tensor product T appears in the interaction expression
quasi only by an “inapt choice of coordinates”. To summarize: by taking “cre-
ated” and “disappearing” particles separately in one spinor product, only scalar
and pseudoscalar “interactions” appear. Apart from the theoretical aesthetic
point of simplicity recommending the ansatz (19), the usage of this simple form
means also a calculational simpliﬁcation in quantitative computations of com-
plicated – e. g. multiply forbidden – transitions, of the exact consideration of
Coulomb corrections etc. We hope to be able to present this in a later article.

Interactions

Abstract

In this paper it is shown, that it is possible to construct parity conserv-
ing baryon-pion interactions, which are γ5 invariant in exactly the same
manner as electromagnetic and weak interactions.

In previous publications [1, 2] the possibility was pointed out to construct
couplings between baryons and π-mesons, which are invariant against space re-
ﬂections and are in addition explicitly γ5-invariant in the same way as the weak
and electromagnetic interactions. Here we understood as γ5 invariance the in-
variance of the interaction operator under the substitution ψK → γ5ψK for any
spin particle K, which appears in the coupling. For example, neutron and pro-
ton are considered as diﬀerent particles. Just this kind of γ5-invariance seems
to be present in the weak interactions [3, 4, 5, 6]. The proof in [1, 2] for the
space-reﬂection invariance of certain γ5 invariant π-meson-baryon couplings is
not correct 1. In this paper a rigorous proof shall be given and the conditions
explained, under which an explicitly γ5-invariant π-meson-baryon interaction is
simultaneously parity-invariant.

At ﬁrst, for simplicity we consider only the π-meson-nucleon interaction.
The γ5-invariant interaction part of the Lagrange density is of the following
form

LW =

¯ψiγµ(1 + γ5) ~T ψ

f
m

∂
∂xµ

~Φ.

(1)

In this equation ~T stands for an isospin-vector matrix, which in general depends
still on the π-meson ﬁeld. Now, we try to determine this isospin matrix ~T such,
that the coupling (1) is space-reﬂection invariant. Since the reﬂection invari-
ance of a γ5-invariant form of coupling, as it is present in (1), is not easy to
see, transformations of the ﬁeld operators should be performed. If we succeed
to determine ~T in such a way, that a transformation of the ﬁeld operators can
be given, which on one side leads to an obvious parity invariant coupling and
on the other side does not change the physical consequences of the theory (S-
matrix), then we have reached our goal.

A simple example is the coupling of neutral mesons, where T naturally has
only one component. In this case (1) is already with T = 1 parity invariant.
Here, the simple substitution (directly in the Lagrange-function or in the ﬁeld
equations)

ψ(x) = c · ei f

m Φ(x)ψ′(x), Φ(x) = Φ′(x)

(2)

leads to ﬁeld equations in ψ′(x) and Φ′(x) with a pure axial coupling [7], c is
a renormalization constant (see Appendix). The possibility, to eliminate the
vector current ¯ψγµψ from the ﬁeld equations, follows from the vanishing of the
divergence of this current. Whereas in the γ5-invariant form of the Lagrange
density and in the equations of motion the parity operator has a complicated
form, for the primed ﬁeld operators the usual form can be used and the reﬂec-
tion invariance can be seen directly. The physical equivalence of the transformed
and untransformed ﬁeld equations follows from the fact, that the ingoing and
outgoing asymptotic ﬁelds of ψ′(x), Φ′(x) agree with the corresponding ﬁelds of
ψ(x), Φ(x) and therefore lead to the same S-matrix. The proof of this assertion
- also for the following more general case - will be given in the appendix.

In the symmetrical meson theory the situation is more complicated, because
In this case we use

of the presence of the non-commuting isospin matrices.
instead of (2) the following substitution 2

ψ(x) = c · U ψ′(x), Φ(x) = Φ′(x).

Here U should represent a matrix invariant under rotations in isospace of the
following form

U =

1 + i~τ ~Φw
1 + ~Φ2w2

,

where for the present w is an arbitrary function of ~Φ2 and ~τ denote the usual
isospin matrices. In order that the ingoing and outgoing ﬁelds for ψ′(x) and
Φ′(x) agree with those for ψ(x) and Φ(x), we require that U allows a power
series expansion in f /m.

Performing the substitution (3) in the Lagrange operator or in the ﬁeld

equations the following new coupling arises:

The ﬁrst term of this expression results from the interaction-free part of the
Lagrange function.

Eq.(5) is certainly a reﬂection-invariant coupling, if the γ5-free term contains
even and the term multiplied with γ5 contains odd powers of the ﬁeld Φ′(x).
(This requirement implies that the meson ﬁeld Φ′(x) is a pseudoscalar ﬁeld.)
Choosing in Eq.(1)

the requirements are fulﬁlled, if for the transformation (3) and (4) the function

is used. w(~Φ2) satisﬁes the requirement on the transformation U made in con-
nection with the asymptotic condition, namely the possibility of an expansion
of it in powers of f /m.

Eq.(1) with (6) can be written in the following form:

In this equation ~jµ denotes the total isovector current following from (1) with
(6), which obeys a continuity equation, whereas ~jA
µ stands for the axial vector
current

~jA
µ = ¯ψiγµγ5~τ ψ.
(9)
2In a somewhat diﬀerent formulation the transformation (3) has been used several times

for the proof of equivalence theorems in the meson theory [8, 9, 10, 11].

This kind of presentation of LW corresponds to the form aimed at in [1, 2]. The
equation (4) in [2] diﬀers from (8) in the last term, which however is necessary
for the space-reﬂection invariance.

Written in the tranformed ﬁeld the coupling has the following form, because

In Eq.(10) the reﬂection invariance is obvious, whereas the γ5- invariance for
every particle, in contrast to (1), does not appear explicitly anymore.

Of course, the form of Eq.(10) for L′W is only an example and is determined
by the specially chosen ansatz for ~T in Eq.(6). This ~T seems to be the simplest
one, which makes the coupling γ5-invariant and reﬂection invariant simultane-
ously.

The coupling to the electromagnetic ﬁeld produces no new diﬃculties. It
turns out that the gauge invariant coupling of the photon to the Lagrange func-
tion containing the interaction Eq.(1) leads to the same result as the explic-
itly reﬂection-invariant coupling to the Lagrange function with the interaction
Eq.(5) 3. This is due to the rotation invariance of the matrix U in isospace,
which leads to the following relation:

U †

(11)

It is suggestive to require the simultaneous parity and γ5- invariance also for
all π-meson-baryon couplings. As long as one can neglect the mass diﬀerence
of the Λ- and Σ particle, the pairs Σ+,
(Λ + Σ0), Σ− can
be introduced [12]. Then the arguments given above for the π-meson-nucleon
interaction can be carried over to all isospin doublets literally.

Appendix

In this appendix the asymptotic equality of the ﬁelds ψ(x) and ψ′(x) shall be
shown. We will require, that the function U from Eqs.(3) and (4) can be in-
1ψ(x) can be expanded into powers of
verted and that the ﬁeld ψ′(x) = (cU )−

f /mΦ(x). The adiabatic hypothesis (f /m → 0 for t → ±∞), used in the past,
lets it appear being plausible that the two ﬁelds ψ′(x) and ψ(x) agree in the
limit of large time.

To proceed more rigorously, the results of the work of Zimmermann [13] can
be used. For this purpose we deﬁne ingoing and outgoing ﬁelds by the relation
[13]

The proof of the equality of the two asymptotic ﬁelds is accomplished, if the

two following points can be proven:
I. A one-nucleon state Ψα of the Hilbert space can be constructed with the help
of the ﬁeld ψ′in/out(x) as well as with the help of the ﬁeld ψin/out(x) from the
vacuum Ω:

Ψα =

ψ∗in/out(x)fα(x)d3x|Ωi =

in/out(x)fα(x)d3x|Ωi

In these expressions fα is a solution of the free Dirac equation.
II. The ﬁeld ψ′in/out(x) possesses with the ﬁelds ψin/out(x) and Φin/out(x) the
same commutation relations as the ﬁeld ψin/out(x) has with these ﬁeld operators.

From points I and II it follows for all Hilbert-space states Ψ1 and Ψ2:

f ∗α(x)hΨ1|ψ′in/out(x)|Ψ2id3x =

f ∗α(x)hΨ1|ψin/out(x)|Ψ2id3x

Z

which shows the complete equivalence of the two asymptotic ﬁelds.

Point I can be obtained from the Lorentz invariance of the ﬁeld operators
ψ(x) and ψ′(x). Denoting by Ψp a one-nucleon state with momentum p and
−p2 = M 2, it is

hΩ|ψin(x)|Ψpi =

and

hΩ|ψ′in(x)|Ψpi = hΩ|ψ′(x)|Ψpi =

In order that on the right side of Eq.(A.4) the plane wave has the same factor
as in Eq.(A.3) the renormalization constant c from Eq.(4), respectively Eq.(2),
must obey the equation

c = (2π)

From the fact, that according to (A.1) the ingoing and outgoing ﬁelds obey the
free Dirac equation, it moreover follows

(A6)

hΩ|ψ′in/out(x)|Ψi = hΩ|ψin/out(x)|Ψi = 0

for all states of the Hilbert space with −p2 6= M 2. From (A.3), (A.4) and (A.6)
the statement I follows.

Furthermore (A.3), (A.4) and (A.6), together with the corresponding rela-
tions for the ﬁeld Φin/out(x), allow the calculation of the vacuum expectation
values of the wanted commutation relations [13]. Therefore the latter ones are
identical for ψ′in/out(x) and for ψin/out(x) ﬁelds. It is more diﬃcult to prove
the full statement II. In order that the equality of the commutation relations is
valid in general and not only for the vacuum expectation values, it is necessary
to show, that all commutation relations are c numbers. Expanding ψ′(x) in a
power series in f /m it seems possible to perform such a proof in analogy to
Zimmermann [13] for every approximation in f /m, if the appearing operator
products are suitably deﬁned.

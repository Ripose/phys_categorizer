Abstract

Birkhoﬀ showed in 1923 that the Schwarzschild solution for the metric from a
point particle was also valid in the a priori non-static case as long as the spherical
symmetry was maintained. This theorem was actually discovered and published two
years earlier by an unknown Norwegian physicist, J.T. Jebsen. His life and scientiﬁc
carreer is brieﬂy chronicled.

The static metric gµν around a point mass M was ﬁrst found by Schwarzschild[1]. It
was derived in 1915 just before Einstein had completed his general theory and the
condition det gµν = −1 had to be imposed, requiring a special choice of coordinates.
Rewriting the result using standard, polar coordinates (r, θ, φ) in addition to the
time coordinate t, he got the corresponding line element in the well-known form

ds2 = (1 − 2GM/r)dt2 −

− r2(dθ2 + sin2θdφ2)

(1)

dr2
1 − 2GM/r

Here G is the gravitational constant and we use c = 1 units. The derivation we
now ﬁnd in most textbooks can be traced back to Hilbert[2] and Weyl[3] as recently
discussed by Antoci[4]. It had also been found around the same time by Droste[5]
who was a student in Leiden, working under the inﬂuence of Lorentz[6].

In 1923 Birkhoﬀ in his textbook on modern physics[7] showed that the static Schwarz-
schild metric (1) is a solution outside any mass distribution, even when this varies
with time as long as the spherical symmetry is maintained. This is now called the
Birkhoﬀ theorem. A practical and important astrophysical application is the spher-
ical collapse of a star which therefore cannot result in any emitted gravitational
radiation. From a mathematical point of view, it was derived in an elegant way,
concentrating on the two essential coordinates (t, r). In this way it can easily be
generalized to spacetimes of higher dimensions. An equivalent result was derived

the same year by Alexandrow using the variational principle[8] and shortly later by
Eisland[9].

Recently it has been pointed out by Deser and Franklin[10] that the theorem was
actually discovered three years earlier by Jebsen and published in 1921 in the pro-
ceedings of the Swedish Academy of Sciences[11]. The derivation is physically moti-
vated and mathematically along the lines suggested by Hilbert[2] which is also the
same way it is nowadays usually presented. It was cited for the ﬁrst time in a short
abstract in English in 1921[12] and also mentioned the same year by Oseen in his
review of the theory of relativity[13]. However, in the following years it was essen-
tially completely overlooked except for a reference by Synge in his book on general
relativity[14]. In addition, nothing seemed to be known about Jebsen. Spurred by
the apparent Scandinavian background of his contribution, we have now managed
to map out most of his life and scientiﬁc achievements[15].

Jørg Tofte Jebsen was born in 1888 in Berger, a small town outside Oslo. After his
secondary studies and a couple of years abroad, he started to study physics in 1909 at
the University of Oslo. The spring of 1914 he spent at the University of Berlin under
the tutelage of Pohl to work on X-rays. Returning to Norway, he spent some time
helping establish physics at the new, technical university in Trondheim. In 1918 he
ﬁnished his thesis for the ﬁnal university exam in Oslo and was apparently so pleased
with the result that he asked for it to be evaluated for a doctors degree. In it he
undertook some investigations of electrodynamical problems within the framework
of the special theory of relativity.

In Oslo at that time there was a general interest in Einstein’s theories among the
students while these new ideas were received with a bit more caution by members of
the faculty. Until then there had not been any Norwegian scientiﬁc publications in
this new ﬁeld. The local faculty committee which was appointed to evaluate Jebsen’s
thesis, therefore took contact with Oseen at the University of Uppsala in Sweden.
He was no great expert either but carried much weight in such matters. Oseen
pointed out a few weak points in the thesis and suggested several improvements.
As a result, Jebsen changed his mind about a possible doctors degree and he was
awarded an ordinary university degree in the spring of 1919. During this period he
had found out that he suﬀered from tuberculosis and sought treatment.

However, Oseen must have seen that Jebsen had talent and valuable insight in these
new theories. During their discussions he was invited to come and visit Oseen
in Uppsala.
In the fall of 1919 he moved there with support from Norway. At
the same time Oseen started a lecture series on Einstein’s general theory, appar-
ently for the ﬁrst time in Sweden. During the following winter Jebsen worked on
In the
spherical symmetrical solutions of Einstein’s gravitational ﬁeld equation.

spring of 1920 he had ﬁnished the paper ¨Uber die allgemeinen kugelsymmetrischen
L¨osungen der Einsteinschen Gravitationsgleichungen im Vakuum in which he de-
rived the Schwarzschild solution (1) without assuming time-independence. It was
sent to the Swedish Academy of Sciences for publication.

Summer of 1920 found Jebsen back in Oslo. At this time Einstein was also there
for ten days by invitation from the local Student Association. He gave three public
and very popular lectures on his new theories. We don’t know if they met, but
Jebsen had informed Oseen that he planned to attend.
In the meantime Jebsen
had been informed that his paper could not be published in Sweden because it was
written by a foreigner. He thus started to consider other journals. At the same
time he also wrote a long and very insightful article on non-Euclidean geometry and
Einstein’s general theory for a newly started mathematical journal[16]. It was the
ﬁrst scientiﬁc exposition in Norway of Einstein’s general theory. In the fall of 1920
he moved to Bolzano in Italy for treatment of his tuberculosis.

Oseen had apparently not accepted the unwillingness of his colleagues to publish
Jebsen’s paper and late in 1920 it was ﬁnally accepted and appeared in print early
in 1921[11]. Jebsen continued a very extensive and interesting correspondence with
Oseen on other solutions of Einstein’s equations and the question of symmetries. His
letters have been kept but not Oseen’s responses[17]. While Jebsen was enthusiastic
about these new developments, it was known that Oseen was more sceptical, in
part because the general theory did not throw any new light on the structure of the
electron[13].

In Italy Jebsen did not get better from his illness, but still ﬁnished a book on
Galilei. He died there early in 1922. The same year Oseen was elected to the Nobel
committee for physics. Here he was inﬂuential in the award of the 1922 Nobel prize
to Bohr for the structure of atoms while Einstein at the same occasion was awarded
the 1921 prize for the photoelectric eﬀect.

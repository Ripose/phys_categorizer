Abstract

We commemorate 50 years from A. Proca’s death. Proca equation is a relativistic
wave equation for a massive spin-1 particle. The weak interaction is transmitted by
such kind of vector bosons. Also vector ﬁelds are used to describe spin-1 mesons (e.g.
ρ and ω mesons). After a brief biography, the paper presents an introduction into
relativistic ﬁeld theory, including Klein-Gordon, Dirac, and Maxwell ﬁelds, allowing
to understand this scientiﬁc achievement and some consequences for the theory of
strong interactions as well as for Maxwell-Proca and Einstein-Proca theories. The
modern approach of the nonzero photon mass and the superluminal radiation ﬁeld
are also mentioned.

1 Introduction and short biography

A. Proca, one of the greatest physicists of 20th century, was born in Bucharest on October
16, 1897. Biographical details can be found in a book editted by his son [1], where his
publications are reproduced; see also the web site [2] with many links. We commemorate 50
years from his death on December 13, 1955. He passed away in the same year with Einstein.
His accomplishments in theoretical physics are following the developments of prominent
physicists including Maxwell, Einstein and Dirac. As a young student he started to study
and gave public talks on the Einstein’s theory of relativity. Then his PhD thesis was
dedicated to the Dirac’s relativistic theory of electrons. Proca equation is a relativistic
wave equation for a massive spin-1 particle. Some of the other relativistic wave eqs. are:
Klein-Gordon eq. describing a massless or massive spin-0 particle; Dirac equation for a
massive spin-1/2 Dirac particle; Maxwell eqs. for a massless spin-1 particle, etc. In ﬁeld
theory, the Proca action describes a massive spin-1 ﬁeld of mass m in Minkowski spacetime.
The ﬁeld involved is a real vector ﬁeld. Maxwell eqs. and Proca eqs. may be found in
many textbooks [3] as important examples of relativistically invariant formulation of the
ﬁeld equations for a free ﬁeld; see also [4, 5]. There are many publications mentioning even
in the title the Einstein-Proca (e.g. [6, 7, 8, 9]), Proca [10, 11], or Maxwell-Chern-Simons-
Proca [12] theory.

Shortly after ﬁnishing in 1915 the Gheorghe Lazar high school in Bucharest Proca had to
interrupt the studies because the ﬁrst world war started. After the war (1918–22) he was
student at the Polytechnical School (PS) specialized in Electromechanics. Next years he
was employed by the Electrical Society, Cˆampina, and in the same time he has also been
assistant professor of Electricity, PS Bucharest. In 1923 he moved to France because he
felt he “have something to say in Physics”. In two years brilliantly passed the exams and
was graduated by the Science Faculty, Sorbonne University, Paris. As an experimentalist

1

at the Institut du Radium he was very much appreciated by Marie Curie; she realized he
is very interested by the theory and encouraged him to join the newly founded Institut
Henri Poincar´e. In 1930 Proca received the French citizenship and married the Romanian
Marie Berthe Manolesco. He started to work as a Boursier de Recherches at his PhD
thesis under L. de Broglie’s supervision. The thesis was defended in 1933 in front of a
famous commission: Jean Perrin; L. Brillouin, and L. de Broglie. In 1934 he was one year
with E. Schr¨odinger in Berlin and few months with N. Bohr in Copenhagen, where he met
Heisenberg and Gamow.

From 1936 to 1941 he developed the theory of the massive vector (spin 1) boson ﬁelds
governing the weak interaction and the motion of the spin-1 mesons; Proca equations refer
to this kind of ﬁelds, and are frequently used in Field Theories. Some of the PACS (Physics
and Astronomy Classiﬁcation Scheme) numbers covered by his work are: 03. Quantum
mechanics, ﬁeld theories, and special relativity: 03.50.-z Classical ﬁeld theories; 03.50.De
Classical electromagnetism, Maxwell equations; 03.70.+k Theory of quantized ﬁelds; 04.
General relativity and gravitation: 04.50.+h Gravity in more than four dimensions, Kaluza-
Klein theory, uniﬁed ﬁeld theories; alternative theories of gravity; 04.60.-m Quantum grav-
ity; 04.70.-s Physics of black holes; 04.70.Bw Classical black holes; 11. General theory of
ﬁelds and particles: 11.10.-z Field theory; 11.10.Kk Field theories in dimensions other than
four; 11.15.-q Gauge ﬁeld theories; 11.30.Cp Lorentz and Poincare invariance; 12. Speciﬁc
theories and interaction models; particle systematics: 12.20.-m Quantum electrodynamics;
12.38.-t Quantum chromodynamics; 12.40.Vv Vector-meson dominance. Prestigious sci-
entists like Yukawa, Wentzel, Taketani, Sakata, Kemmer, Heitler, Fr¨ohlich and Bhabha,
promptly reacted in favour of his equations in 1938. W. Pauli [13, 14] mentioned Proca’s
theory in his Nobel lecture. As a particular sign of his world-wide recognition one can
mention the invitation to attend in 1939 the Solvay Congress.

During the second world war he was for a short time Chief Engineer of the French Ra-
diobroadcasting Company. Then in 1943 he moved to Portugal where he gave Lectures at
University of Portˆo. In 1943–45 was in United Kingdom invited by the Royal Society and
British Admiralty to join the war eﬀort.

After the war in 1946 he started in Paris the Proca Seminar with many prestigious invited
speakers from France and abroad. This seminar contributed very much to the education
of young French scientistists willing to work in the ﬁeld of particle physics. Unfortunately
Proca’s attempts in 1949 and 1950 to get a chair of Physics at the Sorbonne University and
College de France failed for obscure reasons. Nevertheless in 1950 he accepted to organize
with P. Auger the Theoretical Physics Colloquium of CNRS and in 1951 to be the French
delegate at the General Meeting of International Union of Physics. Starting with 1953
Proca had to ﬁght with a laryngeal cancer until December 13, 1955 when he passed away.

2 Particles and ﬁelds

The projection of angular momentum of a particle can be denoted by lz~, with lz an
integer −l ≤ lz ≤ l. The intrinsic angular momentum, s, is called spin. According to the
spin values the particles obey to the Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein statistics. A fermion
(s = (n + 1/2)~, n integer) is called spinor if s = ~/2, e.g.
leptons (e, ν, µ, τ ) or spinor-
vector if s = (3/2)~. A boson (s = n~) can be scalar (s = 0), vector (s = ~, e.g. ω, ρ
mesons, m = 0 photons, weak massive W ±, Z 0 bosons, m = 0 gluons), or tensor (s = 2~,
e.g. graviton). Vector bosons play a central role as they are mediators of three (of the four)

fundamental interactions: electromagnetic, weak, and strong. Tensor bosons are assumed
to mediate the gravitation (see the Table 1).

A particle is a localized entity. A ﬁeld is an assignment of a quantity to every point
of space. Einstein’s special theory of relativity allows for the existence of scalar, vector,
tensor, ﬁelds. Examples of relativistic ﬁelds: Klein-Gordon (s = 0); Dirac (s = 1/2); Proca
(s = 1, m 6= 0); Maxwell (s = 1, m = 0); Rarita-Schwinger (s = 3/2), and Gravitation
(s = 2).

In particle physics, quantum ﬁeld theories, cosmology and quantum gravity, the natural
units, ~ = c = 1, are used. The units of length, time and mass are expressed in GeV:
1 meter= 5.07 × 1015 GeV−1; 1 second= 1.52 × 1024 GeV−1 and 1 kg= 5.61 × 1026 GeV.
The Newton’s gravitational constant is given in terms of Plank’s mass G = M −2
P l , where
MP l = 1.22 × 1019 GeV. In particle physics gravity becomes important when energies or
masses approach MP l.
Geometrical units, c = G = 1, are used in classical general relativity, and every quantity is
expressed in units of length, e.g. ~ = L2
P l where the Planck length LP l = 1.6 × 10−33 cm.
In gravitation (general relativity) quantum eﬀects become important at lenghth scales
approaching LP l. We shall use in the following the natural units.
A contravariant and covariant four vector has four components

aµ = (a0; a1, a2, a3) ;

aµ = (a0; a1, a2, a3)

e.g xµ = (t; x, y, z) = (x0; x1, x2, x3), pµ = (E; ~p ).

For the Lorentz metric the contravariant form gµν = gµν. One can change a contravariant
4-vector into a covariant one by using the relationship aµ = gµνaν. One assumes the
Einstein’s convention: summ over repetead indices.

For a conservative force, ~F , there is a potential V such that ~F = −∇V . The Lagrangian
in terms of the generalized coordinates qi and velocities ˙qi is given by L = T − V , where T
is the kinetic energy. According to the Hamilton’s principle, the classical action developed
during the time interval t2 − t1

is the d’Alembertian.

is obtained by performing a calculus of variations which leads to the Newton’s second law
in classical mechanics of a point particle.

In both special and general relativity one seeks covariant eqs. in which space and time are
given equal status. The above deﬁned action is not covariant. In ﬁeld theory we replace
the qi by a ﬁeld ϕ(x) where x ≡ (t, ~x). A covariant form of action involves the Lagrangian
density, L = L(ϕ, ∂µϕ), which is a functional integrated over all space-time

The quantum mechanics can describe a system with a ﬁxed number of particles in terms
of a many-body wave function. The relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory with creation and
annihilation operators was developed in order to include processes (e.g. n → p + e + ¯νe
or e+e− → 2γ) in which the number of particles is not conserved, and to describe the
conversion of mass into energy and vice versa.

2.1 Klein-Gordon ﬁeld

For a massive (m 6= 0) scalar (spin 0) and neutral (charge zero) ﬁeld, the Lagrangian
density (function of the ﬁelds φ and their x, y, z, t derivatives) is

The Euler-Lagrange formula requires

L = (1/2)[(∂µφ)(∂µφ) − m2φ2]

((cid:3) + m2)φ = 0

i.e. the Klein-Gordon equation. It was quantized by Pauli and Weisskopf in 1934. Relativis-
tic wave equations are invariant under Lorentz transformations, expressing the invariance
of the element of 4-vector length, ds2 = dt2 −(dx2 +dy2 +dz2). The Klein-Gordon equation
was historically rejected as a fundamental quantum equation because it predicted negative
probability density.

For free particles with an internal degree of freedom (e.g. electric charge) the real valued
ﬁeld is replaced by complex ﬁelds φ∗ 6= φ, hence nonhermitean ﬁeld operators ˆφ† 6= ˆφ.

2.2 Dirac ﬁeld

Dirac was looking for an equation linear in E or in ∂/∂t. For a massive spinor (spin 1/2)
ﬁeld the Lagrangian density is

L = ¯ψ(iγµ∂µ − m)ψ ;

¯ψ = ψ∗γ0 Dirac adjoint

where the four 4 × 4 Dirac matrices γµ (µ = 0, 1, 2, 3) satisfy the Cliﬀord algebra

{γµ, γν} = γµγν + γνγµ = 2gµν

The corresponding equation of motion is the Dirac equation

(iγµ∂µ − m)ψ = 0 ;

i(∂µ ¯ψ)γµ + m ¯ψ = 0

One set of 4 × 4 matrices is

γ0 =

I 0
0 I (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

γi =

(cid:18)

where one has 2 × 2 matrices: identity I, zero and Pauli matrices:

0 −i
i

0 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

, σ3 =

0 −1 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

Quantization of the Dirac ﬁeld is achieved by replacing the spinors by ﬁeld operators and
using the Jordan and Wigner quantization rules. Heisenberg’s eq. of motion for the ﬁeld
operator ˆψ(~x, t) reads

i

∂
∂t

ˆψ(~x, t) = [ ˆψ(~x, t), ˆH]

There are both positive and negative eigenvalues in the energy spectrum. The later are
problematic in view of Einstein’s energy of a particle at rest E = mc2. Dirac’s way out of
the negative energy catastrophe was to postulate a Fermi sea of antiparticles. This genial
assumption was not taken seriously until the positron was discovered in 1932 by Anderson.

2.3 Maxwell ﬁeld

In classical ﬁeld theory the diﬀerential form of Maxwell eqs. are given by Gauss’s, Amp`ere’s
and Faraday’s laws plus Maxwell’s extensions. For homogeneous materials:

∇ · ~D = ρ ; ∇ · ~B = 0 ;

~D = ε ~E ;

~B = µ ~H

∇ × ~E = −

∂ ~B
∂t

∇ × ~B/µ = ~j + ε

∂ ~E
∂t

Photons are assumed to be massless (forces of inﬁnite range). Electrodynamics is gauge in-
variant (ϕ and ~A are not unique): Maxwell eqs. do not change under gauge transformation
(with χ = χ(~r, t) an arbitrary diﬀerentiable function)

~A → ~A + ∇χ(~r, t) ; ϕ → ϕ −

∂χ
∂t

The 4-potential and current density are

Aµ = (ϕ; ~A ) = (A0; ~A ), jµ = (ρ;~j )

Scalar, ϕ, and vector, ~A, potentials are introduced via

~E = −∇ϕ − ∂ ~A/∂t, ~B = ∇ × ~A

The four vector potential

Aµ = (ϕ, ~A) ;

gµνAµAν = ϕ2 − ~A2

The antisymmetric ﬁeld-strength tensor

F µν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ

with components F 0i = ∂0Ai − ∂iA0 = −Ei and F ij = ∂iAj − ∂jAi = −ǫijkBk. The
Levi-Civita symbol ǫijk is antisymmetric under exchange of any two indices.
The Lagrangian density is

L = (E2 − B2)/2 − ρV + ~j ~A = −

FµνF µν − jµAµ

(29)

The corresponding Euler-Lagrange eqs. are Maxwell’s eqs. Kaluza and Klein attempted
to unify the gravitation and electromagnetic theories by extending general relativity in 5
dimensions.

2.4 Proca (massive vector boson) ﬁeld

Proca extended the Maxwell eqs. in quantum ﬁeld theory. In 1934 for massive positively
charged particles with spin there were two alternatives: Dirac eqs. having a spectrum of

6

positive and negative energies, a positive charge and a ﬁnite spin (±E, +q, s 6= 0) or Pauli-
Weisskopf based on Klein-Gordon eqs. (±E, ±q, s = 0). Proca worked out new equations
which would allow for positive and negative energies, both signs of the charge, and a ﬁnite
spin (±E, ±q, s 6= 0). For a massive vector boson (spin 1) ﬁeld the Proca equation [15]

is obtained as a Euler-Lagrange eq. emerging from the Lagrangian

(cid:3)Aν − ∂ν(∂µAµ) + m2Aν = jν

L = −

FµνF µν +

m2AµAµ − jµAµ

(31)

after expressing the ﬁeld-strength tensor, F µν, in terms of the four potential Aµ. The
Maxwell ﬁeld is a massless (m = 0) Proca ﬁeld.
In contrast to the Maxwell ﬁeld the
Lorentz condition is fulﬁlled by Proca ﬁeld.
In his Nobel lecture [13], W. Pauli noted:
“The simplest cases of one-valued ﬁelds are the scalar ﬁeld and a ﬁeld consisting of a four-
vector and an antysimmetric tensor like the potentials and ﬁeld strengths in Maxwell’s
theory. While the scalar ﬁeld is simply fulﬁlling the usual wave equation of the second
order in which the term proportional to µ2 has to be included, the other ﬁeld has to fulﬁll
equations due to Proca which are generalization of Maxwell’s equations which become in
the particular case µ = 0.”
Assuming m 6= 0 one has ∂νAµ = (1/m2)∂νjν. If the source current is conserved (∂νjν = 0)
or if there are no surces (jν = 0) it follows that ∂νAν = 0. The ﬁeld eq. gets simpliﬁed
((cid:3) + m2)Aν = 0 for free particles, leading to four Klein-Gordon eqs. for projections.
After Yukawa’s [16] hypothesis of a particle mediating the nuclear interaction this parti-
cle was initially called mesotron, or alternatively the Proca particle (see for example the
ref. [17]).

3 Yukawa and the strong interaction (color force)

Hideki Yukawa (1907-1981) was born in Tokyo as a third son of Takuji Ogawa. Genyo
Yukawa adopted∗ him when he married Sumiko Yukawa in 1932. Hideki won the No-
bel Prize in 1949 for his prediction (in 1934) of the existence of mesons on the basis of
theoretical work on nuclear forces [16]. His potential (of a Debye type)

g2 e−λr
r

(32)

can explain the short range of the strong interaction. At that time there was no link between
the quantum theory of ﬁelds and nuclear theory, except the Fermi’s β-decay theory. When
he was only 27 years old he predicted the existence of new particles now called pions.
Yukawa calculated a mass ∼ 200me (me is the electron mass). By analogy with photons
mediating the electromagnetic interaction he assumed the nuclear forces, acting between
nucleons, are mediated by such bosons. As he suggested, the study of cosmic rays gave the
ﬁrst experimental evidence of the new particles. Yukawa employed a scalar ﬁeld equation.
The right vector ﬁeld was introduced by Proca (see e.g. [14]: “This case holds the center
of current interest since Yukawa supposed the meson to have the spin 1 in order to explain
the spin dependence of the force between proton and neutron. The theory for this case

∗Adoption was a common practice in Japan in a family without son.

has been given by Proca”). At present we know that the strong interaction is mediated by
gluons.

Yukawa was ahead of his time and found the key to the problem of nuclear forces. His
paper was unnoticed until 1937 when Anderson announced his dicovery in cosmic rays of
a particle with a mass similar to that required by Yukawa’s theory. Soon it was clear that
Anderson’s “mesotron” (now the muon or µ-meson) did not possess the right properties;
it is in fact a lepton. Cecil Powell (Nobel prize in 1950) discovered in 1947 the π-mesons
(pions) in cosmic rays.

The name meson means middle-weight between electron and nucleon. Cosmic rays con-
tained two intermediate mass particles: muon and pion. The muon is a lepton (a heavy
counterpart to the electron) and not a meson (although it is still called µ-meson for histori-
cal reasons), but the pion was a true meson of the kind predicted by Yukawa. Around 1970
there were many theories [18] attempting to explain the nuclear interaction. Presently ac-
cording to quantum chromodynamics, the strong interaction, mediated by massless gluons,
aﬀects only quarks and antiquarks; it binds quarks to form hadrons (including proton and
neutron). There are 8 types of gluons.

The theory of the massive vector bosons with spin 1 was developed by A. Proca. Such
bosons (W ± and Z 0 bosons) are mediators of the weak interaction. Proca’s equations are
also used to describe spin 1 mesons, e.g. ρ and ω mesons.

4 Nonzero photon mass and the superluminal

radiation ﬁeld

The eﬀects of a nonzero photon rest mass can be incorporated into electromagnetism
through the Proca eqs. The massive electromagnetic ﬁeld is described by Maxwell-Proca
eqs.

γ = ~/(mγc) is the Compton wave-length of a photon with mass mγ. Implications
where µ−1
of a massive photon: variation of c; longitudinal electromagnetic radiation and gravitational
deﬂection; possibility of charged black holes; the existence of magnetic monopoles [19];
modiﬁcation of the standard model [20], etc. An upper limit for the photon rest mass [21]
is mγ ≤ 1 × 10−49 g≡ 6 × 10−17 eV.
The concept of a nonzero rest mass graviton may be deﬁned [22] in two ways: phenomeno-
logically, by introducing of a mass term in the linear Lagrangian density, as in Proca
electrodynamics, and self-consistently, by solving Einstein’s equations in the conformally
ﬂat case. The rest mass of the graviton was given in terms of the three fundamental
constants: gravitational, Planck, and light velocity. The Einstein-Proca equations, de-
scribing a spin-1 massive vector ﬁeld in general relativity, have been studied [6] in the
static spherically-symmetric case. It was shown [23] that a special case of the metric-aﬃne
gauge theory of gravity is eﬀectively equivalent to the coupled Einstein-Proca theory.

Einstein-Proca ﬁeld eqs. are frequently discussed in connections with dark matter gravita-
tional interactions [24]. At the level of string theories there are hints that non-Riemannian

8

models, such as Einstein-Proca-Weyl theories [7] may be used to account for the dark
matter. Other developments: Proca-Wightman ﬁeld [25]; Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Proca
model [26].

Superluminal (faster than light) particles, tachyons, with an imaginary mass of the order
of me/238, can be described by a real Proca ﬁeld with a negative mass square [27]. They
could be generated in storage rings, jovian magnetosphere, and supernova remnants.

In conclusion, A. Proca lived in a period of great discoveries and development of quantum
ﬁeld theories to which he contributed in an essential way. After about eighty years of
use, Proca equation of the vector boson ﬁelds remains one of the basic relativistic wave
equation. The weak interaction is transmitted by such kind of vector bosons. Also vector
ﬁelds are used to describe spin-1 mesons such as ρ and ω mesons.

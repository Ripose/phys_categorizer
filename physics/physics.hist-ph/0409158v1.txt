Loal spinor strutures in V. Fok's and H. Weyl's work

on the Dira equation (1929)

Erhard Sholz, Wuppertal

Abstrat

In early 1929, V. Fok (initially in ollaboration with D. Iwanenko)

and H. Weyl developed independently from eah other a general relativis-

ti generalization of the Dira equation. In the ore, they arrived at the

same theory by the introdution of a loal (topologially trivial) spinor

strutures and a lifting of the Levi-Civita onnetion of underlying spae-

time. They both observed, in slightly di(cid:27)erent settings, a harateristi

underdetermination of the spin onnetion by a omplex phase fator,

whih gave the symbolial possibility for a reformulation of Weyl's old

(1918) idea to haraterize the eletromagneti potential by a di(cid:27)erential

form transforming as a gauge (cid:28)eld. Weyl and Fok realized the ommon

mathematial ore of their respetive approahes in summer 1929, but

insisted on di(cid:27)erenes in perspetive. An interesting di(cid:27)erene was dis-

ussed by Weyl in his Rouse Ball leture in 1930,. He ontrasted the new

type of uni(cid:28)ation strongly to the earlier geometrially uni(cid:28)ed (cid:28)eld the-

ories (inluding his own). He was quite expliit that he now onsidered

his earlier ideas on geometrization of (cid:16)all of physis(cid:17) as premature and

delared that the new, more empirially based approah would have to

go a long way before it ould be onsidered as a true "geometrization" of

matter strutures.

Introdution

In the early 20th entury the most important impat of mathematial physis

on geometry ame from relativity theory. Historial and philosophial questions

of this interplay have been disussed at various oasions.

The rise of quantum

1

physis brought about a seond shift, philosophially, tehnially and onep-

tually muh deeper, for the relationship of geometry to physis. It started in

the late 1920s, gained momentum in the seond half of the past entury and

began to dominate the image of knowledge for the deeper levels of physial ge-

ometry during its last two deades.

Other ontributions to these onferene

2

proeedings are evidene for the atuality of this reent and ongoing shift in our

understanding of physial geometry, whih is far from ompleted and ontinues

to be an open-ended and ontroversial pro jet.

3

An important turn in the relationship between relativity, quantum mehanis

and (cid:28)eld theory, whih also sheds light on the nature and role of geometry in

this oneptual omplex, was initiated by Hermann Weyl and Vladimir Fok in

early 1929. They both started to investigate (generalized) Dira (cid:28)elds in the

ontext of general relativity by the introdution of loal spinor strutures on

Lorentz manifolds. This topi was taken up anew in the 1960s from a global

point of view.

Up to the end of the 1920s mathematial physiists had essentially two

symboli tools for the represention of physial (cid:28)elds at their disposal: ve-

tors/tensors (inluding di(cid:27)erential forms) and linear onnetions (mostly but

not always a(cid:30)ne), most important among them, of ourse, the Levi-Civita

onnetion of general relativity (GRT). After 1918 H. Weyl tried to onvine

physiists and mathematiians for some time to use another type of onnetion

(length onnetion) in ombination with a onformal (lass of ) Lorentz metri

in his (cid:28)rst, stritly metrial gauge geometry.

Most physiists who onsidered

5

Weyl's length onnetion at all referred to it as just another di(cid:27)erential 1-form

ϕ =

ϕidxi

P

with a peuliar, perhaps even strange, transformation behaviour.

In the early 1920s A. S. Eddington started to build his attempts towards a

uni(cid:28)ed (cid:28)eld theory of eletromagnetism, gravitation and matter using general

a(cid:30)ne onnetions (not neessarily derived from a metri); and Einstein joined

him for a while from 1923 onward. These ativities were part of a broader move

towards uni(cid:28)ed (cid:28)eld theories (UFT's) with a (cid:28)rst high tide in the 20s of the

last entury, whih has been studied historially, among others, by Vladimir

Vizigin (Vizgin 1994) and, more reently and in a di(cid:27)erent methodologial ap-

proah, by Catherine Goldstein and Jim Ritter (Goldstein/Ritter 2000).

Vizgin presents the relationship of UFT and quantum physis (QP) as one of

ompeting researh programs mutually in(cid:29)uening eah other. The introdution

of loal spinor strutures by Fok and Weyl in 1929 is a beautiful example for

his ase. Both, Weyl and Fok, were struk by the early suesses of the Dira

equation for the explanation of the motion of the eletron and attempted an in-

tegration of GRT and the Dira (cid:28)eld. In suh an attempt they were not alone.

Other authors, like Wiener and Vallarta, attempted a similar integration along

di(cid:27)erent lines, building upon Einstein's reent theory of (cid:16)distant parallelism(cid:17).

They attempted to adapt the Dira (cid:28)eld to a framework of lassial UFT's that

soon turned out to be too restritive.

Weyl and Fok, the latter after an initial phase of sympathizing with distant

parallelism, pursued an approah of a ovariant di(cid:27)erentation of spinor (cid:28)elds

derived from the underlying Levi-Civita onnetion, in ontrast to the distant

parallelism program. Both realized that, in doing so, an underdetermination

of the ensuing spinor onnetion led naturally to an additional U (1)-symmetry.

They used the latter for a representation of the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld ompara-

ble to, although slightly di(cid:27)erent from, Weyl's earlier approah using a length

onnetion. Thus they arrived at a geometri-analytial struture in whih the

atual knowledge of gravitation, eletromagnetism and the basis of the quan-

tum theory of the moving eletron ould be represented in an integrated form.

7

Both authors posed the question how geometry might be brought into agree-

ment with quantum physial knowledge of their time. They arrived at strongly

diverging evaluations as to what they had ahieved in this respet and what

geometrization of quantum physis might mean at all (last setion).

Before I disuss Weyl's and Fok's respetive approahes and di(cid:27)erenes with

This approah is disussed, from a more reent point of view, by P. Cartier's in his

ontribution to this volume.

Another high tide, in a di(cid:27)erent historial/sienti(cid:28) ontext and with hanged onep-

tual/symbolial approahes, started in the 1970s. It has not yet found the detailed and ritial

historial investigation it deserves, although work has started (Cao 1997), (Morrison 1995),

(Galison 1995), (O'Raifeartaigh/Straumann 2000).

knowledge from whih they started and outline their 1929 work.

Setting the stage in the later 1920's for Weyl and Fok

During the 1920s the onstitutive onditions for the mathematization of geome-

try and matter hanged deeply. In the middle of the deade (1925/26) the (cid:16)new(cid:17)

quantum mehanis took shape, with its di(cid:27)erent versions, in entral aspets

ompatible, although at least historially and oneptually not ompletely equiv-

alent, put forward by Heisenberg/Born/Pauli, Shrödinger and Dira.

Contin-

uing this turn in late 1926, W. Heisenberg started to investigate the symmetry of

atomi eletrons using surprisingly old-fashioned mathematis, Serret's Algèbre

supérieure from 1879. But already in the following year the two young Hungar-

ians, E. Wigner and J. von Neumann, working in Berlin and Göttingen, applied

group representation methods for this goal, as did H. Weyl in a leture ourse

devoted to this sub jet in the winter semester 1927/28 at the ETH Zürih.

9

Still in 1926, W. Pauli attempted to haraterize the new hypothetial ele-

tron (cid:16)spin(cid:17) in terms of quantum mehanial symbolism and introdued a pair of

(cid:16)wave(cid:17) funtions (ψ1(x), ψ2(x)), x

Like Heisenberg, Pauli did not think in terms of group representations at that

time; he onstruted his two-valued wave funtions from the Klein-Sommerfeld

theory of the spinning top and the omplex representation of rotations by

Cayley-angles. That was an ingenious and mathematially momentous move

towards what little later turned into (Eulidean or relativisti) spinors, al-

though Pauli's hopes to ome to a diret explanation of the (cid:28)ne struture

of the hydrogen spetrum were not full(cid:28)lled at the time.

attempts in 1926 and 1927 to take relativisti e(cid:27)ets into aount, spinless

(Klein-Gordon) or with spin (Darwin), were no more suessful in this re-

spet.

The situation hanged ompletely in January and February 1928 when

Dira proposed to use 4-omponent omplex-valued (cid:16)wave(cid:17) funtions ψ(x) =

Thus things looked quite di(cid:27)erent for Weyl in the late 1920s from what they

had been at the end of his (cid:28)rst phase of ativity in mathematial physis early in

the deade. Already in late 1920 he had lost on(cid:28)dene in theories of matter by

uni(cid:28)ation of lassial (cid:28)elds aording to the Hilbert/Mie approah, inluding

his own one built upon the length gauge.

While expeting new insights from

14

the rising quantum mehanis, he onentrated on more oneptual or purely

mathematial researh (cid:28)elds: the analysis of the spae problem about 1922/23

and representation theory of Lie groups during the years 1924 to 1926.

Weyl

15

kept well informed on the ongoing development during the ruial years for

quantum mehanis in the middle of the deade, drawing upon his lose sien-

ti(cid:28) relationship with Pauli (1924 (cid:21) 1928 at Hamburg university), dating from

their ooperation on uni(cid:28)ed geometrial (cid:28)eld theories in the early 1920s. More-

over he had ontats with E. Shrödinger who taught at the university in Zürih

between 1921 and 1927. He appararently felt hallenged to ontribute to the

oneptual and mathematial lari(cid:28)ation of the framework of the (cid:16)new(cid:17) quan-

tum mehanis, in partiular from the point of view of unitary geometry (Weyl's

title for the (cid:28)rst part of his leture in 1927/28) and the use of representation

theory of (Eulidean) rotations and permutation for atomi line spetra, Pauli's

non-relativisti spin, and mehanism of moleular binding fores.

In winter 1927/28 Weyl had a hane to take up the hallenge. Both theo-

retial physiists working at Zürih had aepted outside alls and had left: P.

Debye hanged from the ETH to the university Leipzig and E. Shrödinger from

the loal university to Berlin. Weyl deided to hange the sub jet of a leture

ourse initially planned and announed on (pure) group theory to one on Grup-

pentheorie und Quantenmehanik (Theory of Groups and Quantum Mehanis.

Notes were taken by his assistant F. Bohnenblust and published, after revision

and extension, in August 1928 as a book (Weyl 1928), whih in the sequel will

be abbreviated as GQM. In this seond book on mathematial physis, Weyl

was more autious than he was in Raum - Zeit - Materie (Weyl 1918) in his

expetations of how his ontributions might be reeived by the workers in the

(cid:28)eld. In the prefae to the new book, he remarked:

It is the seond time that I dare to turn up with a book whih

belongs only partly to my own speiality, mathematis, and partly

to physis.

. . . I just annot avoid to play the role of a messenger

(often undesired, as I have experiened su(cid:30)iently learly) in this

drama of mathematis and physis - fertilizing eah other in the

dark, although from fae to fae preferring not to reognize and even

renouning eah other. (Weyl 1928, Vf., my translation, E.S.)

Weyl was not alone in this "role of a messenger" as he realized during the

preparation of the leture notes for publiation. Other authors started in 1927

and 1928 to use group representations in quantum mehanis, among them,

most importantly from the mathematial point of view, J. von Neumann and

E. Wigner. Also on the physial side, things hanged rapidly. Dira published

his papers on the relativisti theory of the eletron at the end of the winter

semester, in January and February 1928. The impat was enormous and were

su(cid:30)ient reason for Weyl to add to his book a whole new passage on Dira's

equation (Weyl 1928, 1st ed., ŸŸ39(cid:21)41).

Another remark in his letures of 1927/28 leads diretly to our geometrial

17

topi.

Weyl's gauge idea from 1918, originally linked to a length alibration

and (cid:16) in(cid:28)nitesimal length transport(cid:17) haraterized by a 1-form ϕ =

ϕidxi

was

rephrased in a quantum mehanial setting by E. Shrödinger, still in a length

P

alibration interpretation (Shrödinger 1922), and after the rise of the (cid:16)new(cid:17)

quantum mehanis by V. Fok and F. London in the ontext of Kaluza-Klein

theory of quantum mehanis (Fok 1926, London 1927). The ore of their

respetive arguments dealt with (cid:16)gauging(cid:17) a wave funtion ψ(x) by a point-
˜ψ(x) = eiλ(x)ψ(x). The dif-
dependent phase fator eiλ(x)

(with λ

∈ IR) to

ferential of the purely imaginary phase fator, used in Weyl's 1918 theory to

(cid:16)gauge-transform(cid:17) length onnetions, ould now be used to transform eletro-

magneti potentials ϕj a little more onviningly

Weyl endorsed this reontextualization of his original gauge idea when he

disussed the Shrödinger equation in 1927/28. Probably he had read only the

papers by Shrödinger and London, whih he ited, not Fok's; but London

was aware of and built upon (Fok 1926).

He remarked that the Shrödinger

equation

ontaining the Hamilton operator

is adequately modi(cid:28)ed by using the ovariant derivative ∂ϕ with respet to a
potential onnetion ϕ = (ϕj), if a harged partile in (cid:28)eld of potential ϕ is

harge e in an eletromagneti (cid:28)eld of potential ϕ results. Weyl observed that

now:

The (cid:28)eld laws satis(cid:28)ed by the potentials ψ and ϕ of the material and

the eletromagneti waves are invariant under simultaneous substi-

. . . (Weyl 1928, 1st ed. 87f.)

He ommented that this (cid:16)priniple of gauge invariane(cid:17) was quite analogous

to the one he had postulated in 1918 (cid:16)by speulative reasons to gain a uni(cid:28)ed

theory of gravitation and eletromagnetism(cid:17) and ontinued:

. . . But now I believe that the gauge invariane does not ouple ele-

triity and gravitation, but rather eletriity and matter in the mode

presented here. How gravitation aording to the general theory of

relativity an be inluded is still unertain. (Weyl 1928, 1st ed. 88)

Thus Weyl proposed more than a tehnial adaptation of his old gauge idea to

the new framework of QP. In lassial UFT the goal was to unify fore (cid:28)elds as

suh in a oherently geometrized, often highly speulative, (cid:16)a priori(cid:17) manner,

and to derive matter strutures from them; here Weyl indiated a new paradigm

entering around the searh for oneptual and mathematial strutures whih

link fores to matter (cid:28)elds, without redution of one to the other and with

strong input from experimental evidene.

Classial UFT was, of ourse, still quite alive at that time. In 1928 A. Ein-

stein turned towards (cid:16)distant parallelism(cid:17) for his latest approah to uni(cid:28)ation.

He assumed or postulated, that, in addition to the Levi-Civita onnetion of

the Lorentz metri, an integrable, urvature free, orthogonal onnetion ∆i
with torsion (∆i

kj ) is given, whih he usually desribed by a globally

jk =

∆i

jk

−

parallel system of orthogonal frames. With respet to suh an additional stru-

ture it was meaningful to onsider onstant, i.e. point independent, rotations.

Although Einstein did not intend so, his additional struture allowed a formu-

lation of the Dira equation in the framework of GRT with distant parallelism

and stimulated other physiists to do so.

V. Fok and his Leningrad olleague D. Ivanenko started to explore suh

They hoped to (cid:28)nd some (cid:16)bridge(cid:17) between gravitation and quantum

theory.

ued metri form of some new (cid:16)linear quantum geometry(cid:17). From that point of

, whih they tried to interpret as a matrix val-

view they hoped to (cid:28)nd a kinship between Einstein's (cid:28)eld of distant parallelism

and the new (cid:16)linear geometry(cid:17) (Fok/Ivanenko 1929, 801). During the following

months Ivanenko and Fok realized that the linear struture of the new geometry

ould better be understood as a ovariant derivative of the 4-omponent om-

plex wave funtions whih they alled (cid:16)semi-vetors(cid:17), the later spinors.

Still

21

they alled the geometry they were heading for (cid:16)géométrie quantique linéaire(cid:17)

(Fok/Ivanenko 1929b, Fok 1929a).

V. Fok ontinued to explore the terrain

22

and realized soon that the new ovariant derivation of spinors had a muh loser

kinship with a Weylian phase gauge than with Einstein's distant parallelism.

He presented his (cid:28)ndings in two artiles (no longer o-authored by Ivanenko)

to Physikalishe Zeitshrift and Comptes Rendus (Fok 1929a, Fok 1929b).

He thus arrived at a theory ombining gravitation, Dira (cid:28)eld, and eletromag-

netism, whih overlapped in large parts with what Weyl ahieved in early 1929

when he ontinued researh along the lines indiated in GQM.

Weyl's and Fok's loal spinor struture

Weyl left Zürih in September 1928 for Bologna (ICM) and Prineton where he

spent a year as reseah professor in mathematial physis.

There he ould

24

ontinue, among other things, his researh on the Dira equation in general

relativity. The approah of distant parallelism did not appear at all onvining

to him. He onsidered it to be a ompletely (cid:16)arti(cid:28)ial(cid:17) devie and looked for

a ombined struture of GR and the Dira equation from the point of view

of (cid:16)purely in(cid:28)nitesimal(cid:17) geometry, whih now had to be re(cid:28)ned and extended

in the light of new physial knowledge.

In February 1929 Weyl submitted a

(cid:28)rst sketh of methods and results under the title Gravitation and the eletron

to the Proeedings of the National Aademy of Sienes (Weyl 1929a). Three

months later he delivered a more extended exposition to Physikalishe Zeitshrift

(Weyl 1929b).

At that time he ould not know of Fok's parallel work, nor

25

did he know of it when he wrote his third paper on the topi in early summer

(Weyl 1929).

Fok, on the other hand, got to know of Weyl's new researhes (Weyl 1929a)

only after he (cid:28)nished his own artile for Physikalishe Zeitshrift. He aepted

the ommon mathematial ore of their respetive approahes, but emphasized

the di(cid:27)erenes from the physial point of view in a postsript (Fok 1929b, 276f.).

Weyl apparently got to know Fok's work in summer 1929 and was so fond of the

ommon features of their work that he onsidered it as establishing essentially

one and the same theory. He thus referred to it in the prefae to the seond

edition of GQM as the (cid:16)general relativisti formulation of the quantum laws,

whih have been developped by Mr. V. Fok and the author [Weyl himself ℄(cid:17)

(Weyl 1928, vii, 2nd edition 1930).

26

Fok and Weyl applied the method of (pseudo-) orthogonal moving frames

in Lorentzian spae-time M , i.e. they supposed an

orthonormal frame of tangent vetors (ONF):

e(α, x), 0

α

3,

≤

≤

M with oordinates x = (x0, . . . , x3) (depending di(cid:27)eren-
in eah point P
tiably on the point). Tangent vetors v at x
M ould thus be represented
in omponents referring to the oordinate basis (ξj), or in omponents with
respet to the ONF (ξ(α) in Weyl's notation):

(5)

Besides (di(cid:27)erentiable) hange of oordinates, hanges of the ONF from e(α, x)
to e′(β, x) (0

Weyl saw no hane to give an exposition of this theory in the book GQM. In the seond

edition he rephrased, however, his disussion of the representation of the Lorentz group and

of the speial relativisti Dira equation, in partiular the deomposition of the 4-dimensional

spinors into irreduible 2-dimensional representations.

In more reent terminology: By means of the ONF's Fok and Weyl redued the

group of the a(cid:30)ne onnetion Γi
parallel transport in M by the resulting orthogonal onnetion ωα

jk to the orthogonal group, and haraterized

βk .

In the late 1920s this was standard knowledge. The idea of ONFs had already

been introdued by Rii and Levi-Civita in 1900; it had been worked out by

di(cid:27)erential geometers in the 1920s, most prominent among them E. Cartan (in

letures from 1926/27 published as (Cartan 1928)), J.A. Shouten, R. Weitzen-

bök, L.P. Eisenhart (in monographs 1926 and 1927). Moreover, orthonormal

frames played a entral role in Einstein's theory of (cid:16)distant parallelism(cid:17), from

whih Fok (and Ivanenko) took the idea.

Fok (still in his ooperation with

27

Ivanenko) and Weyl realized that redution of the Levi-Civita onnetion to the

orthogonal group by the ONF method allowed one to introdue ovariant dif-

ferentiation of spinors.

Weyl explained learly that the orthogonal redution

28

of the onnetion was neessary in this ontext, beause (cid:16)Dira's quantity(cid:17) ψ

. . . orresponds to a representation of the orthogonal group whih

annot be extended to the group of all linear transformations. The

tensor alulus is onsequently an unusuable instrument for onsid-

erations involving ψ . (Weyl 1929a, 219)

For Weyl, this group-theoreti onsideration was of great importane. In the

early 1920s he had analyzed the role of tensors from the point of view of group

representions and found out that all irreduible representations of GL(n, IR)

with a spei(cid:28)ed permutation symmetry an be haraterized by tensors over

n

29

IR

.

In a language loser to physiists he explained more in detail:

Vetors and [tensors℄ are so onstruted that the law whih de(cid:28)nes

the transformation of their omponents from one Cartesian set of

axes [ONF℄ to another an be extended to the most general linear

transformation, to an a(cid:30)ne set of axes. That is not the ase for [the℄

quantity ψ , however; this kind of quantity belongs to a representa-

tion of the rotation group whih annot be extended to the a(cid:30)ne

group. (Weyl 1929a, 234)

He admitted that the ONF method used by him resembled Einstein's lat-

est appproah in formal aspets, but insisted that this was only a super(cid:28)ial

oinidene.

In his main artile Fok referred, however, also to (Eisenhart 1926) (Fok 1929b, 263,

But here there is no talk of (cid:16)distant parallelism(cid:17); there is no india-

tion that Nature has availed herself of suh an arti(cid:28)ial geometry. I

am onvined that if there is a physial ontent in Einstein's latest

formal development it must ome to light in the present onnetion.

And he added a reason that went beyond purely mathematial onsiderations:

It seems to me that it is now hopeless to seek a uni(cid:28)ation of grav-

itation and eletriity without taking material waves into aount.

(Weyl 1929a, 219)

Dira had shown that the equation of the free eletron expressed in ψ is invari-

ant under Lorentz transformations without asking for the underlying reprenta-

tion of the Lorentz group,

but other authors did so immediately later. F.

Möglih alulated the omplex 4

30

as a (cid:16)(multivalued!) 4-dimensional representation of the Lorentz group(cid:17) (von

Neumann 1929, 867). Von Neumann emphasized, very muh like Weyl, that

something essentially new was introdued into mathematial physis:

The ase of a quantity of 4 omponents whih is no 4-vetor has

never ourred in relativity theory, the Dira ψ -vetor is the (cid:28)rst

example of this kind. (ibid.)

31

Thus, immediately after Dira's publiations on the (cid:16)spinning(cid:17) eletron, the-

oretially minded authors realized that the new (cid:16)Dira quantity(cid:17) (Weyl), the

(cid:16)ψ -vetor(cid:17) (von Neumann), or the (cid:16)semi-vetor(cid:17) (Fok, Landau e.a.) was more

than just another tehnial devie, but led to a oneptual innovation for math-

ematial physis. Change of referene systems in speial relativity ((cid:16)Cartesian

systems of axes(cid:17) as Weyl would say) by a Lorentz transformation had to be

represented by Λ(o) in the ψ -spae in a way that ould not be extended to gen-

eral linear transformations and thus ould not, in a straight-forward manner,

be transferred to general relativity.

At the time when Fok and Weyl approahed the problem of a general rel-

ativisti formulation of the Dira equation, the young algebraist B.L. van der

Waerden established an algebrai alulus for all possible quantities appearing

in any representation of the Lorentz group. His ontribution was meant as a

sort of servie to the physiists, stimulated by a question of P. Ehrenfest who

had posed the question to design suh an algebrai alulus. Van der Waerden

piked up the terminology(cid:16)spinor(cid:17) from Ehrenfest and gave him a broad audi-

ene (van der Waerden 1929, 100). In this work he built upon Weyl's exposition

of the representation theory of the Lorentz group in GQM.

Distint from other work about 1929, Fok and Weyl admitted point-dependent

SO+(1, 3), di(cid:27)erentiably de-
(Lorentz-) rotations of ONF in spae-time, o(x)
pending on x, induing point-dependent transformations Λ(o(x)) of the spinor

∈

(Dira 1928, 310(cid:27).), disussed in (Kragh 1981, 57f.).

spae. While Fok immediately headed for the ovariant derivation of a spinor

((cid:16)semi-vetor(cid:17)), Weyl made the underlying invariane idea expliit. He stated for

the (cid:16)laws(cid:17) that would be haraterized by an ation priniple and by di(cid:27)erential

equations derived from it:

The laws shall remain invariant when the axes in the various points P

are sub jeted to arbitrary and independent rotations. (Weyl 1929a,

Variational equations were thus required to be invariant under simultaneous

219)

transformations

(cid:22) of vetors/tensors by Lorentz rotations o(x)

(cid:22) and of the spinors under Λ(o(x)).

In this way, Weyl and Fok introdued and started to study a loal spinor

struture on the underlying spae-time manifold M . Both authors used loal
hange of oordinates in the spinor spae Λ(o(x)) (the hange of trivialization
in later language) aompanying a hange of ONF's o(x), and Weyl disussed its

oneptual role quite learly, although of ourse not yet applying the terminology

of loal bundles trivialization.

Weyl did not mention, however, that for a globalization of the proedure

the topology of the M might play a role. Suh questions of global existene of
an ONF (presupposing parallelizability of M ), were posed and answered only

in the 1930s by the young generation of topologists (E. Stiefel, H. Whitney),

apparently stimulated by Einstein's use of (loal) (cid:16)distant parallelism(cid:17), not by

loal spinor strutures of Fok and Weyl. Global questions for spinor strutures

were taken up still another generation later and beame a researh topi only in

the 1960s.

Weyl, in his 1929 artiles, did not even indiate that there might be

32

an open and hallenging question in the relationship between spinor strutures

on M and its topology.

Of immediate interest, for our authors, was the introdution of an (cid:16)in(cid:28)nites-

imal displaement of semi-vetors(cid:17) (Fok) or the (cid:16)invariant hange δψ on going
from the point P to a neighbouring point P ′

(cid:17) (Weyl 1929a, 221), i.e. in mod-

ern terminology the introdution of a onnetion and parallel transport in a

loal spinor struture, lifted from the Levi-Civita onnetion in the underlying

Lorentz manifold. On this point the two authors applied slightly di(cid:27)erent ap-

proahes; Weyl's approah was, as one may expet, more oneptual and Fok's

more alulational.

This oneptually lear desription of the ovariant di(cid:27)erential, had the ad-

vantage that in Weyl's disussion Λ ould stand for any representation of the

Lorentz group, not just Dira's original 4-dimensional one.

Weyl realized of ourse, as did von Neumann in 1928, that Dira's represen-

tation an be deomposed into two irreduible representations ρ and ρ+
generate all (cid:28)nite dimensional representations of SL(2, C) by tensor produts

(whih

and diret sums). He gave a beautiful geometrial desription of the 2-valued

inverse of the overing map

33

−→
and took ρ as the idential representation of SL(2, C) and ρ+ = t ¯ρ its ad-
joint. Then he ould write Dira's representation (up to a permutation of ψ -

SL(2, C)

SO+(1, 3)

oordinates) as

and wrote the 4-spinors (after a linear transformation) as (ψ+

a semi-vetor ψ under an in(cid:28)nitesimal parallel displaement(cid:17) are ompatible

with parallel displaement of vetors. This allowed him to ompute matries

di(cid:27)erential(cid:17) δψ of equation (8).

An additional U (1)-gauge

Up to this point I omitted an important observation made by both authors,

whih led bak to Weyl's gauge idea. The (cid:16)lifting(cid:17) of the Levi-Civita onnetion

to the spinor struture was not uniquely determined, even if we neglet the

double valuedness of the SL(2, C) overing of the Lorentz group.

Fok's alulation of the the matries (equation (10)) showed that the om-

patibility ondition determines the Cl only up to addition of purely imaginary
matries ifl1I. Covariant di(cid:27)erentiation of spinors (equations (12), (13)) is then
ifαψ . In a kind of déja vu Fok realized that

a(cid:27)eted by an additive term −

the additional term ould be pereived as derived from a phase-gauge fator of

the ψ -(cid:28)eld:

The appearane of the Weylian di(cid:27)erential form in the law of parallel

displaement stands in lose relation to the fat remarked by the

author [Fok℄ and also by Weyl (. . . ) that the addition of a gradient

to the 4-potential orresponds to a multipliation of the ψ -funtion

by a fator of absolute value 1. (Fok 1929b, 266)

On that basis, Fok formulated the Dira equation for the general relativisti

eletron by ovariant derivation in his loal spinor struture, inluding a Weylian

U (1)-gauge term as an integrated part of the ovariant derivation (13) (ibid.)

Weyl disussed the question similarly, although slightly more general. He

argued that any semantially relevant information derived from a spinor (cid:28)eld

had to be invariant under U (1)-symmetries of the spinor representation, beause
the SO+(1, 3)-ovariants used to represent physial quantities were given by
Hermitian forms < ψ, Aψ > and thus were invariant under multipliation by a
phase fator eiλ
of ψ . Therefore the spinor onnetion ((cid:16)the in(cid:28)nitesimal linear
transformation dE of the ψ (cid:17)) is determined by the (cid:16)in(cid:28)nitesimal rotations(cid:17) ω

of the redued Levi-Civita onnetion only up to (cid:16)a purely imaginary multiple

i

df of the unit matrix(cid:17). In other words, with dE

dE′

= dE + idf 1I

is also ompatible with the underlying metri of GRT. Weyl onluded:

For the unique determination of the ovariant di(cid:27)erential δψ of ψ
~P P ′ = (dx) starting from P is needed.
suh a df for eah line element

(Weyl 1929b, 263)

12

The seletion among the spinor onnetions ompatible with the Levi-Civita

onnetion ould justly be onsidered as a (cid:16)gauge(cid:17), in strong analogy to the

length gauge of 1918. Morover Weyl used, just like Fok, the possibility to

express the Dira equation of the eletron in an eletromagneti (cid:28)eld by means

of ovariant di(cid:27)erentiation of spinors inluding a U (1)-gauge potential ((cid:16)suh a
df (cid:17)).

For ation funtions applying to spinor (cid:28)elds he felt it legitimate to postulate:

If one (. . . ) substitutes

ψ by eiλ

ψ

·

fp by fp

∂λ
∂xp

−

with λ an arbitrary funtion of the position, gauge invariane nees-

sarily holds, in the sense that the ation priniple remains invariant.

(Weyl 1929b, 263)

From the point of view of in(cid:28)nitesimal symmetries, the new gauge struture

resembled in ertain features Weyl's study of the Raumproblem early in the

1920s. In the analysis of the spae problem he had haraterized (cid:16)ongruenes(cid:17)

by a subgroup G of SL(n, IR), ontained in a larger group H of (cid:16)similarities(cid:17), in
whih G was normal (in fat, H was the normalizer of G in GL(n, IR)). One of

his postulates was a uniqueness ondition for an a(cid:30)ne onnetion equivalent (in

a ertain sense) to a given linear onnetion in the larger group. In 1929 he again

dealt with a pair of groups, now given by physial onsiderations, the smaller

one being the Lorentz group or its universal onvering, G = SL(2, C), and the
U (1) in whih G was normal by onstrution.
larger one was H = SL(2, C)

×

Again a uniqueness ondition for a onnetion, ompatible to another given

one, played a ruial role for the analysis. The uniqueness ondition was now

formulated (cid:16)bottom up(cid:17), i.e. from a given (Levi-Civita) onnetion in the smaller

group to the larger one, and uniqueness of the (spinor) onnetion with respet

to the larger group was ahieved only by adding a onnetion in the quotient

group U (1) (respetively bundle, from the later point of view). In this sense

there was a strutural analogy onsidering group extensions for in(cid:28)nitesimal

symmetries, although the methodology had hanged onsiderably. In 1929 Weyl

no longer tried to found his approah on a priori priniples, but rather analyzed

symboli forms worked out ((cid:16)onstruted(cid:17)) by mathematial physiists in lose

ommuniation with experimental knowledge of the rising quantum physis.

Weyl disussed how one ould arrive at physial onsequenes from his ap-

proah. It would lead us too far to follow this line here.

I just want to mention

34

that Weyl drew impressive onsequenes from the postulate of invariane of the

ation integral under in(cid:28)nitesimal symmetries of di(cid:27)erent kinds:

(cid:22) in(cid:28)nitesimal rotations of the frames leads to symmetry of the energy-

momentum tensor,

(cid:22) in(cid:28)nitesimal oordinate translations leads to (cid:16)quasi(cid:17)-onservation of en-

ergy and momentum and in the ase of speial relativity by integration to

invariane of rotational momentum (Weyl 1929b, 256(cid:27).),

35

34

35

Cf. (Straumann 2001).

Weyl spoke of (cid:16)quasi-onservation(cid:17) of energy-momentum tq

p , beause of a seond term in

13

(cid:22) in(cid:28)nitesimal U (1) gauge transformations leads to onservation of harge

(ibid., 264f.).

He hoped, morover, that his general relativisti approah to the Dira equa-

tion, together with the separation of the spinor (cid:28)elds into omponents of ir-

reduible representations ρ and ρ+

might lead to a solution of the problem of

negative energies in the original Dira equation. In late 1929 Dira proposed

a solution to this problem by some imaginative ad-ho arguments postulating

the existene of positive eletrons (positrons) appearing as onstitutive parts of

the solution of the original Dira equation with non-vanishing mass term, and

surprising (cid:16)(cid:29)utuations(cid:17) between positive and negative harge ontributions to

it. It turned out that neither the positive harge ontributions ould be sepa-

rated nor the resulting (cid:16)(cid:29)utuations(cid:17) eliminated from the solution (Kragh 1990,

90(cid:27).).

Weyl, for his part, attempted for a short while in 1929 to avoid suh (cid:29)u-

tuations by the proposal to study solutions of a modi(cid:28)ed Dira equation in the

irreduible omponents of the representation ρ and ρ+

separately (Weyl spinors).

He remarked, however, that in this equation no mass term ould be inluded

without losing gauge invariane (Weyl 1929a, 242). As a researh strategy to

overome the problem he proposed to neglet at (cid:28)rst, on the level of the spinor

equation, the mass of the eletron and to reonstrut it, in a seond step of

theory development, as an integral invariant that ouples to gravitation.

Be bold enough to leave the term involving mass entirely out of

the (cid:28)eld equations. But the integral of the total energy density

over spae yields an invariant, and at the same time onstant, mass;

require of it that its value be an absolute onstant of nature m whih

annot vary in value from ase to ase. This introdution of mass

is born of the idea that the inertia of matter is due to its energy

ontent. (Weyl 1929a, 243)

Suh an approah made sense only in a joint theory of gravitation, quantum

physis (in the sense of the modi(cid:28)ed Dira equation) and eletromagnetism. In

his attempt for an integrated theory Weyl now pursued the onrete goal to

ontribute to the solution of the mass problem of the eletron.

The proposal to start from a (cid:16)massless(cid:17) eletron was rejeted by physiists

immediately.

In the postsript to his artile for the Physikalishe Zeitshrift

Fok argued strikingly (and presumably also onviningly for Weyl)

that the

36

urrent of the Weyl-spinor (cid:28)eld was lying on the light-one. Thus there remained

no realisti hope for a solution of the eletron's mass problem along the line in-

diated by Weyl (Fok 1929b, 276f.). Similarly Pauli rejeted Weyl's proposal to

irumvent the mass problem for the eletron, although from a oneptual point

of view he found the new integration of the gauge idea into quantum physis

the di(cid:27)erential equation derived from invariane under in(cid:28)nitesimal translations:

Literal onservation of energy and momentum holds only if the respetive terms of the gravi-

tational (cid:28)elds are added or, in speial relativity, after speialization of the ONF's (Weyl 1929b,

257f.).

36

In the 2nd edition for GQM Weyl no longer insisted on his 1929 proposal and supported

Dira's strategy to deal with the problem (Weyl 1928, 2nd. edition, 230, 233).

most onvining. He ontributed essentially to its dissemination and survival

in the physis ommunity. Moreover he revived Weyl spinors in 1956 when he

looked for an adequate mathematial representation of his newest hypothetial

entity, the neutrino. This is a di(cid:27)erent and historially ompliated story whih

annot be dealt with here.

37

Weyl indiated that (cid:28)eld quantization was another problem that had to be

solved before one might hope for an answer to the questions raised:

Another di(cid:30)ulty whih stands in the way of a omparison with ex-

periene is that the (cid:28)eld equations must (cid:28)rst be quantized before

they an be applied as a basis for the statistis of quantum tran-

sitions. But our theory is also hopeful in this respet inasmuh as

the anti-symmetri Fermi statistis of the eletrons, orresponding

to the Pauli exlusion priniple, here neessarily leads to the sym-

metri Bose-Einstein statistis of photons. (Weyl 1929a, 244)

Weyl ould probably not surmise whih tremendous di(cid:30)ulties had to be sur-

mounted on the path indiated here. When he reworked GQM for the seond

edition he knew already more about the nature of problems arising from the

in(cid:28)nities of (cid:28)eld quantization. He made some striking observations with respet

to symmetries in quantum eletrodynamis, but did not ontribute to its further

development in the later 1930s and 40s.

38

Geometry and physis: interpretations and perspetives

As we have seen, Weyl's and Fok's 1929 work ontained a strong ommon

mathematial ore. They both established loal spinor strutures on Lorentz

manifolds with an additional internal U (1) symmetry and proposed to use a

onnetion in this struture, determined by or determining gravitation and ele-

tromagnetism and governing the motion of the spinor (cid:28)eld. But they had strong

di(cid:27)erenes with respet to the question of how geometry and physis ould or

should be related.

Fok prolaimed that his goal was (cid:16)the geometrization of Dira's eletron

theory and its subsumption (Einordnung) in general relativity(cid:17) (Fok 1929b,

275). This was a oneptual-methodologial task, rather than one of onrete

physial theory building. He hoped, however, that his investigation might (cid:16)on-

tribute to the solution of the problems(cid:17) in Dira's theory, referring apparently to

the paradox of negative energies and positive probability of (cid:29)utuations between

negative and positive energies, respetively harges. He thus expeted that his

geometrization of the Dira operator might lead, in the long run, to progress

of a physial theory in a more tehnial sense. Fok's main hope was, however,

to ontribute to what he (and Ivanenko) thought to be a hallenging goal of

ontemporary physis, the development of a ommon oneptual struture for

relativity and quantum physis.

V. Fok had learned relativity from A. Friedmann and partiipated promi-

nently in the development of relativity theory in Russia.

In the later 1920s he

39

maintained lose ontat to a group of young physiists in Leningrad around L.

Landau, G. Gamow, and M. Bronstein, to whih his early 1929 oauthor D. Iva-

nenko belonged. The young physiists enthusiastially supported the ultural

awakening in the early Soviet Union and wanted to ontribute to it through

their work in relativity and quantum physis.

This was apparently part of the

40

bakground for Fok's and Ivanenko's premature laim to have found a path

towards quantum geometry.

In a letter to Nature, dated Marh 21, 1929, they announed their (cid:28)rst, still

very skethy ideas on (cid:16)linear geometry(cid:17) as a ontribution to this hallenging

41

task.

In the Comptes Rendus note of May 22, 1929, they shifted attention in

their (cid:16)géométrie quantique linéaire(cid:17) from the (cid:16)matrix valued linear metri(cid:17) to

parallel displaements and ovariant di(cid:27)erentiation in a loal spinor struture.

One more, they laimed to have found a method to reonile quantum physis

with geometry

Il importe de signaler un point qui distingue les idées exposées dans

ette Note de elles d'Einstein et de Levi-Cività: 'est l'intervention

des matries-opérateurs dans les équations pour les quantités pure-

ment géométriques. Grâe à ela on peut bien s'imaginer un hamp

életromagnétique dans un espae eulidien, e qui était impossible

dans les autres théories. (Fok/Ivanenko 1929b, 1472)

In his later ontributions Fok was more autious and weakened the laim

to the more moderate one of having pursued (cid:16)the geometrization of Dira's

theory of the eletron and its subsumption under the general theory of relativity(cid:17)

(Fok 1929b, 275). He admitted that the (cid:16)di(cid:30)ulties whih are inherent in

Dira's theory(cid:17) had not yet been touhed, but added:

Our investigations might perhaps ontribute indiretly to the solu-

tion of these di(cid:30)ulties, by showing what the original unhanged

Dira theory an ahieve. (ibid.)

The referene to the (cid:16)original unhanged Dira theory(cid:17) was probably formulated

after Fok got to know Weyl's proposal and indiated a disassoiation from

the latter, the reasons of whih were explained in the postsript. Fok thus

prolaimed that the geometrization of the Dira equation by the spinor struture

with onnetions and ovariant derivation was an important methodologial

ahievement in itself.

On this point Weyl did not agree at all. He had lost on(cid:28)dene in the

geometrial uni(cid:28)ation programs whih he himself had ontributed so e(cid:27)etively

by his gauge uni(cid:28)ation in 1918. About the end of the 1920s he no longer

expeted any deeper understanding of physial reality by the still blossoming

geometrial uni(cid:28)ation programs.

He ritiized, in partiular, Einstein's latest

42

attempt at uni(cid:28)ation by an additional struture of distant parallelism as a turn

towards a physially unmotivated (cid:16)arti(cid:28)ial geometry(cid:17) (Weyl 1929a, 219 quoted

40

(Frenkel/Gorelik 1994, 20(cid:27).).

41

With respet to their purely formal (cid:16)linear form with matrix oe(cid:30)ients(cid:17) ds =

k γkdxk
(see above) they prolaimed: (cid:16)This linear ds is onneted with Dira's wave equation in the
same way as the Riemannian ds2

P

with the relativisti wave equation of the older theory.

. . . This linear geometry seems to furnish a basis on whih a uniform theory of gravitation,

radiation, and quantum phenomena is to be onstruted(cid:17) (Fok/Ivanenko 1929a). For more

details they referred to their forthoming paper (Fok/Ivanenko 1929)

42

On the (cid:16)diversity(cid:17) of these programs see (Goldstein/Ritter 2000).

16

above). In his later 1929 paper for Physikalishe Zeitshrift he argued in more

detail:

I am unable to believe in distant parallelism for several reasons.

Firstly, a priori, my mathematial sense (mathematishes Gefühl)

opposes against aepting suh an arti(cid:28)ial geometry; for me, it is

di(cid:30)ult to oneive of a power whih would make the loal systems

of axes, in their twisted position in the di(cid:27)erent world-points, freeze

together in rigid a(cid:30)liation. Moreover, two important physial rea-

sons have to be added. . . . (Weyl 1929b, 246)

As (cid:16)(cid:28)rst physial reason(cid:17), Weyl mentioned his gauge theory of eletromagnetism.

He argued that only the point-dependene of the ONF's gave rise to a variable

phase fator eiλ

and thus the new priniple of gauge invariane. The (cid:16)seond

physial reason(cid:17) was, to Weyl, the possibility to derive symmetry of the energy-

momentum tensor and the invariane of rotational momentum in speial rela-

tivity from in(cid:28)nitesimal rotations of the ONF's or of in(cid:28)nitesimal translations

of oordinates (see above). Thus Weyl's (cid:16)physial reasons(cid:17) onsisted essentially

of methodologial arguments for the superiority of invariane properties in an

in(cid:28)nitesimal symmetry approah, lose to those whih about three deades later

beame entral in the rise to prominene of more general (cid:16)gauge(cid:17) theories.

43

The 1930 Rouse Ball leture at Cambridge university gave Weyl the opportu-

nity to explain his view of the uni(cid:28)ation programs to a wider sienti(cid:28) audiene.

He still onsidered the attempts (cid:16)to geometrize the whole of physis(cid:17), undertaken

after Einstein had so suessfully geometrized gravitation, very omprehensible

at its time (Weyl 1931, 338). He explained his own theory of 1918 and sum-

marized its ritial reeption by physiists. He reviewed Eddington's approah

to uni(cid:28)ation by a(cid:30)ne onnetions and Einstein's later suppport for that sub-

program, always in omparison with his own (cid:16)metrial(cid:17) uni(cid:28)ation of 1918, and

onluded that in hindsight one ould see that both theory types were (cid:16)merely

geometrial dressings (geometrishe Einkleidungen) rather than proper geomet-

rial theories of eletriity(cid:17). He ironially added that the struggle between the

metrial and a(cid:30)ne UFT's (i.e. Weyl 1918 versus Eddington/Einstein) had lost

importane, as in 1930 it ould no longer be the question whih of the theories

would (cid:16)prevail in life(cid:17), but only (cid:16)whether the two twin brothers had to be buried

in the same grave or in two di(cid:27)erent graves(cid:17) (ibid., 343). He again made lear

that he ould not (cid:28)nd any argument in favour of Einstein's distant parallelism

approah, nor ould he (cid:28)nd good prospets for the Kaluza-Klein approah.

44

Weyl even aused Einstein's new theory of (cid:16)breaking with the in(cid:28)nitesimal

point of view. (. . . ) The result is to give away nearly all whih has been gained

in the transition from speial to general relativity. The loss is not ompensated

by any onrete gain(cid:17) (Weyl 1931, 343).

Weyl pereived a nearly omplete sienti(cid:28) devaluation of the UFT's of the

1920s, resulting from developments in the seond part of the deade:

In my opinion the whole situation has hanged during the last 4 or 5

years by the detetion of the matter (cid:28)eld. All these geometrial leaps

Cf. (Morrison 1995).

43

44

The revival of Kaluza-Klein type theories in the 1980s happened in a ompletely di(cid:27)erent

ontent of theory development.

In this onferene, moreover, P. Cartier argued that there

are reasons whih might lead to a renewed interest in the original form of Weyl's purely

in(cid:28)nitesimal geometry (cid:22) again in a modi(cid:28)ed physial interpretion and theory ontext.

17

(geometrishe Luftsprünge) have been premature, we now return to

the solid ground of physial fats. (Weyl 1931, 343)

He ontinued to sketh the theory of spinor (cid:28)elds, their phase gauge and its

inlusion into the framework of general relativity along the lines of the 1929 ar-

tiles. Weyl emphasized that, in ontrast to the priniples on whih the lassial

UFT's had been built, the new priniple of phase gauge (cid:16)has grown from ex-

periene and resumes a huge treasury of experimental fats from spetrosopy(cid:17)

(ibid. 344). He still longed for safety, just as muh as at the time after the First

World War, when he designed his (cid:28)rst gauge uni(cid:28)ation. Now he no longer

expeted to ahieve it by geometri speulation, but tried to anhor it in more

solid grounds:

By the new gauge invariane the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld now beomes

a neessary appendix of the matter (cid:28)eld, as it had been attahed to

gravitation in the old theory.

(Weyl 1931, 345, emphasis in original)

Weyl made it very lear to his readers that he had hanged his perspetive.

He no longer saw a hane in attempts to derive matter in highly speulative

approahes from mathematial strutures devised to geometrize fore (cid:28)elds; he

now set out to searh forms for the mathematial represention of matter, whih

gave expression to the enduring traes in the (cid:16)huge treasury(cid:17) of experimental

knowledge. For him, this was reason enough to prefer the view that the eletrial

(cid:28)eld (cid:17)follows the ship of matter as a wake, rather than gravitation(cid:17) (ibid.).

In short, Weyl had turned from his idealist approah to matter, pursued at the

turn to the 1920s, to a symboli realist one at the end of the deade. This hange

of perspetive had onsequenes for his views on geometrization. With referene

to Fok's interpretation of the role of geometry in the general relativisti Dira

equation Weyl ontinued:

Mr. Fok alls the derivation of the new gauge invariane from gen-

eral relativity, whih he arrived at nearly simultaneously with me,

a geometrization of Dira's theory of the eletron. In this respet I

annot agree with him. My impression is that we have abandoned

geometrization by linking eletriity to matter rather than to gravi-

tation. I fear that the geometrizing tendeny, whih seized gravita-

tion in full right and supported by the most intuitive arguments, was

misled when it was extended to other physial entities. (Weyl 1931,

345)

Weyl did not, on the other hand, ompletely negate any possibility to (cid:28)nd a

geometrial quantum theory. He only warned that, if one wanted to ontinue

with the geometrizing tendeny, one had to invent a (cid:16)natural geometry(cid:17) leading

to a spinor type (cid:28)eld ψ for the haraterization of its struture, in addition to

the ONF. Whereas Fok laimed to have ahieved this already, Weyl remained

agnosti:

(ibid.)

One had to set out in searh of a geometrization of the matter (cid:28)eld;

if one sueeds here, the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld is added as a premium

to the bargain. I have no idea what kind of geometry this might be.

18

From the perspetive of late 20th entury developments in di(cid:27)erential geometry

and the tremendous role of gauge (cid:28)eld theories, Weyl's evaluation is highly

surprising and even seems paradoxial: Why did he not perieve his own and

Foks's invention of loal spinor strutures with additional U (1)-gauge as a

su(cid:30)iently rih extension of geometry to deal with matter strutures?

45

Our own perspetive has been shaped by the development of di(cid:27)erential

geometry and topology in the seond half of the last entury, whih was deeply

in(cid:29)uened by Elie Cartan's work, the work of his students and other researhers.

In the late 1950s and 1960s bundle strutures with their inbuilt transformation

behaviour have beome entral onepts in geometry and topology. In this sense,

Weyl's (cid:28)rst desideratum of a (cid:16)natural geometry(cid:17) whih inludes spinor type (cid:28)eld

in its ore struture seems to be satis(cid:28)ed, and it beomes di(cid:30)ult to grasp why

Weyl, unlike Fok, did not aept their ommon ontribution as a valuable step

in this diretion.

We may assume that Weyl over-emphasized his septiism with respet to

geometrization of physis at the turn to the 1930s, beause he still wanted to

orret his earlier exuberane in this respet. Moreover he wanted to disassoiate

himself strongly from the (cid:16)old(cid:17) uni(cid:28)ation programs whih where still alive in

the latest attempts of Einstein, or Kaluza and Klein, and wanted to ounterat

them in the sienti(cid:28) disourse as learly as possible.

For a proper historial understanding we have to take another aspet into

aount. Weyl's attempts to integrate geometry with physis had, from their

very beginnings after the First World War, a strong intentional referene to the

quantum stohastial aspets of matter as a a (cid:16)dynamial agens(cid:17), even at a time

when these were not understood at all. In the early 1920s Weyl had dared to

speulate in wide leaps about a possible relationship between the intuitive, the

mathematial and the physial understanding of the ontinuum, some inbuilt

disrete (cid:16)free-hoie(cid:17) strutures and the end of lassial determinism in natural

siene.

In 1925, in his manusript for the Lobahevsky entenary volume

46

(published only posthumously (Weyl 1988)), Weyl indiated that the vagueness

of physial determination of spae-time loalization has to be taken seriously for

the basi theoretial struture of geometry. This vagueness ought to be onsid-

ered a prinipal feature for the mathematial haraterization of geometry and

to be dealt with, in priniple, in some stohastial approah informed by (cid:16)the

atual state of physis(cid:17), i.e. quantum physis. But then, so Weyl remarked, at

a time when the (cid:16)new(cid:17) quantum mehanis was just being shaped, the question,

how suh a quantum stohastial foundation for geometry relates to the di(cid:27)er-

entiable struture of lassial geometry, turned into a ompletely open problem.

He ended the passage by the honest remark:

One has to admit that until now nearly nothing has been ahieved for

the question what it means to apply di(cid:27)erential alulus to [physial℄

reality. (Weyl 1988, 12)

With suh questions Weyl was not ompletely alone. But they were far from

what most physiists or mathematiians onsidered useful at the time, or even

later in the 1930, when Fok's young olleague M. Bronstein explored the ques-

tions of a neessary revision of time-spae onepts from the point of view of

I thank Jim Ritter who indiated this point to me and insisted on a loser historial

perspetive.

quantum physis (Frenkel/Gorelik 1994, 83(cid:27).). Fok's hope of 1929 to leave

lassial geometry behind and to turn towards geometrial quantum strutures

was omparably innoent. With suh a point of view he was ontent with an ex-

tension of di(cid:27)erential geometry whih would appear, at most, as a semi-lassial

enrihment.

In his 1930 talk at Cambridge (and its later publiation) Weyl expressed

learly that from a proper geometry of matter he expeted a deep break with

the lassial tendeny of geometrization prevailing in the UFT's. He was less

lear, to say the least, what should be substituted for it; but there were strong

reasons for suh vagueness. His own approah to the mass problem of the

eletron had turned out to be unsatisfatory; Dira's alternative appeared more

promising, but still had a long way to go before a tehnially valid solution of

the quantization problem was in sight

(cid:22) not to speak about the extensions

47

of later quantum gauge (cid:28)eld theories and the still unanswerable question of

the mass spetrum of basi onstituents of matter. Therefore Weyl's remark (cid:16)I

have no idea what kind of geometry this might be(cid:17), was just as honest as his

omment in 1925 that (cid:16)nearly nothing had been ahieved(cid:17) for a semantially

reliable relation of the di(cid:27)erentiable struture of geometry to the (cid:16)atual state

of physis(cid:17).

Other ontributions to this onferene explore the muh broader and deeper

mathematial knowledge at the turn to the 21st entury. Notwithstanding a

whole range of new open questions and desiderata, inluding the one for a his-

torial evaluation of reent developments, we now see several andidate programs

for a quantum geometry aiming at (or preparing) a uni(cid:28)ation of quantum (cid:28)eld

theories.

It is not yet lear, whether one of them (or perhaps several) will

48

(cid:16)prevail in life(cid:17). Weyl's proposal to look for a (cid:16)geometry of matter(cid:17) informed

by the treasury of experimental knowledge ould still be taken as an advie for

a ritial disourse in and among the di(cid:27)erent researh programs.

Perhaps

49

future developments will show whether Weyl's guess that the geometrization of

interation and metrial (cid:28)elds is (cid:16)added as a bonus(cid:17) one a proper geometry of

matter has been ahieved is just another speulative dream. It still may turn

out that it indiates a hint for an appropriate theory development.

At the turn of the entury we may add that, in addition to reent and oming results in

high-energy spetrosopy, geometrial aspets of low energy EPR-type experiments onstitute

a valuable novel part of the (cid:16)treasury(cid:17) of experimental knowledge, whih ought to be taken

into aount in a future (cid:16)geometry of matter(cid:17).

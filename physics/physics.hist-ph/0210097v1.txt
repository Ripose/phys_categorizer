Abstract

There is a section in Chandrashekar’s ”Newton’s Principia for the Common Reader ”, (Clarendon

Press, Oxford, 1995) in which he claims to ﬁnd a small error in the Principia. . However we believe

that there is a mistake of interpretation underlying Chandra’s claim and that the Principia is correct

as it stands. This short paper describes Chandra’s misinterpretation of a geometric construction of

Newton and gives an outline of Newton’s demonstration by following the standard English version

of the Principia line by line and converting it into modern mathematical notation in the spirit of

Chandra’s book.

Towards the end of his life the great astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrashekar wrote a

very interesting, educational, and entertaining book which was a reader’s guide to Newton’s

Principia (”Newton’s Principia for the Common Reader ”, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995).

Chandra characterized the nature of his project in the prologue as ” an undertaking by a

practising scientist to read and comprehend the intellectual achievement that the Principia

is ”. The resulting book is a wonderful translation of Newton’s arguments into modern

language and mathematical notation accompanied by historical and physical commentary.

There is a section of Chandra’s book in which he claims to ﬁnd a small error in the

Principia. This is the sort of claim that naturally draws one’s attention. However we

believe that there is a mistake of interpretation underlying Chandra’s claim and that the

Principia is correct as it stands. This short paper describes Chandra’s misinterpretation

of a geometric construction of Newton and gives an outline of Newton’s demonstration by

following the standard English version of the Principia line by line and converting it into

modern mathematical notation in the spirit of Chandra’s book.

First a brief description of the issue, which concerns Newton’s prescription for determining

the orbits under an inverse cube force (Proposition XLI, corollary, III, page 132, section 50

in Chandrashekar) which appears about a quarter of the way through the Principia. After

Newton has introduced his laws of motion and derived Kepler’s laws, he is in the midst of

deriving properties of orbits for various types of centripetal forces, employing such ideas as

102

energy conservation and the clear formulation of initial value problems. In Corollary III to

Proposition XLI concerning the orbits under a centripetal force, Newton outlines a geometric

construction for determining the orbits under an inverse cube force. This construction relies

on the use of an auxiliary conic section, the curves VRS in the ﬁgure shown below. According

to Newton’s construction when the auxiliary curve is a hyperbola, the constructed orbit (the

curves VPQ) spirals in towards the center and when the auxiliary curve is an ellipse the

constructed orbit is a hyperbola. This introduction of an auxiliary curve has led to some

confusion and led Chandrashekar to assert, in section 50 of his book, that the correct result

is the other way around and that the statement in the Principia must be a misprint. It seems

that the introduction of an auxiliary curve led Chandrashekar to a slight misinterpretation

of the argument which it is the purpose of this note to clarify.

In this paper all ”quotes” from the Principia, which was of course originally written

in Latin, are from the English translation ”Sir Isaac Newton’s Mathematical Principles of

Natural Philosophy and His System of the World”, translated by A. Motte, revised by F
Cajori, University of California Press, Berkeley, 1934).1

Fig. 1) The curve VRS is tha auxiliary conic section used by Newton to construct the

orbit VPQ. In ﬁg. (a) the auxiliary curve is an ellipse leading to an orbit, whose radius is

103

given by CT (RT is the tangent to VRS) which grows continuously as the auxiliary point

R(x,y) moves down the ellipse to S. In ﬁg. (b) the auxiliary curve VRS is a hyperbola

leading to an orbit VPQ whose radius (CT) decreases as the auxiliary point R(x,y) moves

towards S. The area VRC proportional to the angle along the orbit, VCP, is indicated.

See text below. (Adapted from Chandrashekar)

In his discussion Chandra quotes the following passage from the Principia:

”..therefore if the conic section VRS be a hyperbola, the body will descend to

the centre (along VPQ); but if it be an ellipse, it will ascend continually and go

farther and farther in inﬁnitum. And on the contrary. (Parentheses added)

Chandra then comments (page 180)

”On the face of it, one would conclude that the words ’hyperbola’ and ’ellipse’

(underlined) have been interchanged by a simple oversight. Certainly, an orbit

which is a hyperbola in the (r, t) plane ascends to inﬁnity while φ tends to a

ﬁnite limit, while an orbit which is an ellipse on the (r, t) plane descends to the

centre in a spiral orbit...”

In this statement and in the discussion on p. 176 it is clear that Chandra is interpreting

the diagrams given by Newton as being orbits in the (r, t) plane but Newton never mentions

time in his discussion and we will see that if one interprets the curves VRS as auxiliary

curves and VPQ as the orbits the statement in the Prinicpia is correct as it stands.

At the beginning of section 50. Chandra states the word ”body” is not used with its

standard meaning. Newton states

”..from the place V there sets out a body with a just velocity...that body will

proceed in a curve VPQ ...”, (page 132)

(see complete quote below). However if we accept VPQ as the trajectory, then there does

not appear to be anything wrong with this use of the word ”body”.

In the next section we repeat Chandra’s calculation of the orbit and in section 3 we show

that following Newton’s prescription leads to the same orbit.

I. ORBITS FOR AN INVERSE CUBE FORCE

Following Chandra (equation 1, p. 174) we write the conservation of energy

where the ﬁrst term is the potential for the 1/r3 force and the second term is the centrifugal

potential. (We took ˙r = 0 at r = β). Conservation of angular momentum yields

Considering ﬁrst h2 > 1 (1) and the initial condition yields

Evaluating the integral (4) we ﬁnd (taking φ = 0 at r = β)

which is the equation of a hyperbola (Chandrashekar equ. 25, p 178). Using conservation

of angular momentum (2) or evaluating the integral (3) we ﬁnd that the orbit in the (r, t)

plane is indeed a hyperbola

any part of Newton’s argument. In the next section we look directly at Newton’s suggested

construction.

II. COROLLARY III; NEWTON’S GEOMETRICAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE

ORBITS FOR AN INVERSE CUBE FORCE

In the following we will calculate the orbits following Newton’s prescription step by step.

The references are to the ﬁgure The quoted passages are from p.132 Principia, 3rd ed, etc....

(i) ”If to the centre C and the principal vertex V, there be described a conic

section VRS;...”

Designating the point R by the coordinates (x, y) with y axis along CV and x axis directed

to the right from the origin C, we can write the equations for the conic section taken as an

ellipse (lhs ﬁg)

or, alternately as a hyperbola (rhs ﬁg)

(9)

(10)

(ii) ”...and from any point thereof, as R, there be drawn the tangent RT meeting

which is equation (7). Thus we see that the curve generated by P following Newton’s

prescription (quotes (iii) and (iv) above) for the conic section VRS being an hyperbola (10)

does indeed spiral into the center.

”..and if a centripetal force inversely proportional to the cubes of the distances

of the places from the centre, tends to the centre C: and from the place V there

sets out a body with a just velocity in the direction of a line perpendicular to the

right (straight) line CV; that body will proceed in a curve VPQ , which the point

P will always touch; and therefore if the conic section VRS be an hyperbola,

the body will descend to the centre,

as the point R moves up the curve VRS the point T moves toward the origin.

as the point R moves down the ellipse VRS and the tangent approaches the vertical, the

point T moves oﬀ to inﬁnity.

III. CONCLUSION

We have shown that following Newton’s geometric prescription one generates the correct

orbits for the inverse cube force; taking the auxiliary curve as a hyperbola leading to orbits

that spiral in towards the center while an ellipse as auxiliary curve leads to hyperbolic orbits

ﬂying out to inﬁnity so that there is no confusion in Newton’s presentation.

To return to the quote from Newton cited by Chandra (see introduction)

”..therefore if the conic section VRS be a hyperbola, the body will descend to

the centre (along VPQ); but if it be an ellipse, it will ascend continually and go

farther and farther in inﬁnitum. And on the contrary.” (Parentheses added)

to which Chandra had the following comment:

”On the face of it, one would conclude that the words ’hyperbola’ and ’ellipse’

(underlined) have been interchanged by a simple oversight. Certainly, an orbit

which is a hyperbola in the (r, t) plane ascends to inﬁnity while φ tends to a

ﬁnite limit, while an orbit which is an ellipse on the (r, t) plane descends to the

centre in a spiral orbit...”

We see that Newton’s statement was indeed correct and can see, as well, the origin of

Chandra’s statement.

Certainly none of this is meant as a criticism of Chandra, who was clearly a very creative

and insightful scientist. (The book in question was published in the year of his death at age

85). We feel that Chandra would not have wanted such an apparent error of interpretation

in his wonderful work to stand.

For us the interesting thing was the fun of following Chandra’s lead in reading a small

piece of one of Newton’s original arguments in the Principia and reconstructing the reasoning

109

for ourselves. Although we verify that Newton’s construction is correct, the really interesting

question is how he came up with the idea for such a construction in the ﬁrst place. It is

also interesting to note how succinctly Newton was able to present the argument, requiring

about half a page including the ﬁgure. Newton himself explains his reasoning:

”All these things follow from the foregoing Proposition (XLI, page 139, which,

as explained by Chandra, is an exposition of the general energy integral method

for solving the motion of a particle under an arbitrary central force), by the

quadrature of a certain curve, the invention of which as being easy enough, for

brevity’s sake I omit.”

This passage was quoted by Chandra (page 174) as an introduction to his solution of the

orbits using the energy integral method in which he identiﬁes the curves VRS with the orbit

in the (r, t) plane, something, which seems not to have been intended by Newton.

The Principia has a reputation as one of the least frequently-read ”great books”. For the

usual reasons of time pressure felt so strongly in science education curricula, few instructors

try to teach the subject of mechanics by guiding students through Newton’s derivations in
the Principia. However with the aid of Chandra’s lovely book and similar books2,3 it is

now far more practical for an instructor to consider using a few selected excerpts from the

Principia to give students a taste of the real Newton. We feel that some students would be

excited by the opportunity to confront a piece of the Principia with some guidance and we

hope that more instructors will consider this possibility.

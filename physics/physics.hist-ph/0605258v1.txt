Coulomb oscillation in the hydrogen atom
and molecule ion

Abstract

Semiclassical oscillation of the electron through the nucleus of the H atom
yields both the exact energy and the correct orbital angular momentum for
l = 0 quantum states. Similarly, electron oscillation through the nuclei of
H +
2 accounts for a stable molecule ion with energy close to the quantum
mechanical solution. The small discrepancy arises from the neglect of the
electron’s wave nature.

INTRODUCTION

Two of the reasons why the old quantum theory of Bohr and Sommerfeld
was abandoned in the mid 1920s were the theory’s failure to give the correct
multiplet structure of the hydrogen atom and the stability of the hydrogen
molecule ion, H +
2 .1 The old vector model of angular momentum2 gave, for
a given principal quantum number n, sublevels with angular quantum num-
bers l = 1, 2, ..., n.3 Spectroscopic evidence, however, showed multiplicities
of spectral line splitting in a magnetic ﬁeld according to l = 0, 1, ..., n
1.
Max Jammer, in his review,2 notes that “the old quantum theory could never
resolve this inconsistency.”

−

A treatment of the hydrogen molecule ion with Sommerfeld’s quantization
conditions had been Wolfgang Pauli’s doctoral thesis of 1922.4 Pauli found its
molecular binding energy to be positive (non-binding)—contrary to (later)
experimental ﬁndings. Martin Gutzwiller5 thinks that “the solution of this
problem can be rated, with only slight exaggeration, as the most important
in quantum mechanics, because if an energy level with a [more] negative
value [than of a free hydrogen atom] can be found, then the chemical bond
between two protons by a single electron has been explained.”

Both dilemmas of the old quantum theory can be resolved, though, with
a single extension: an oscillation of the electron through the nucleus (nuclei)
of the atom (molecule). In essence this solution is already formally included
in Sommerfeld’s theory of the hydrogen atom6 but was explicitly omitted by
Sommerfeld and his school as being unphysical. The case in point, obtained
with Sommerfeld’s quantization conditions for radial and angular motion,
is a quantum state with zero angular action, characterized by an angular
quantum number l = 0. What is its orbit?

The geometry of an nl Sommerfeld ellipse is given by its semimajor axis,
anl = (rB/Z)n2, and semiminor axis, bnl = (rB/Z)n
l(l + 1).7 Here rB =
h2/4π2me2 is the Bohr radius in terms of fundamental constants, serving as
an atomic distance unit, and Ze is the nuclear charge. An (n, 0) orbit is thus a
line ellipse with its nuclear focus at one end and its empty focus at the other.
This case was regarded as unphysical because of the electron’s collision with
the nucleus—an uncritical adaptation from celestrial mechanics. A closer
inspection conﬁrms that a line ellipse with terminal nuclear focus is indeed
unphysical—but for quite a diﬀerent reason!

Fig. 1. Partial trajectory of an extranuclear orbit XX ′ and of a penetrating
orbit P P ′ through nucleus N . The dotted line S shows the major symmetry axis
of XX ′.

Leaving quantization conditions momentarily aside, what would happen
if we continuously decrease an angular quantum number λ while keeping the
principal quantum number n constant? We then would get more and more
slender ellipses with the same length of major axis, 2an. By basic electric
theory, the nuclear Coulomb potential outside a ﬁnite-size nucleus N is
given by the point potential as if all nuclear charge, +Ze, was concentrated
at the center of the nucleus. This holds as long as the electron orbit stays
outside the nucleus. Two borderline cases are illustrated in Fig. 1. For a very
small λ value, say 0 < λX ≪
1, we obtain a very slender elliptical orbit with
partial trajectory XX ′ about the nucleus. Further decrease of λ to λP < λX
causes an intrusion of the electron into the ﬁnite nucleus of radius rN (see
trajectory P N in Fig. 1). Once inside, at a distance r < rN from the center,
then, by Gauss’s law, only a fraction of the nuclear charge, Z ′(r)e < Ze,
acts on the electron via centripetal force.8 Accordingly, the electron’s exit
trajectory NP ′ is no longer symmetric to its approach trajectory P N with
respect to the major axis S of the (partial) ellipse XX ′.
In the extreme
case of a head-on penetration of the nucleus, λ = 0, there is no centripetal
force at all! The electron will then, with almost constant speed, traverse the
nucleus, continue, with decreasing speed, to the opposite turning point of its
line orbit and revert its motion periodically. We want to call the electron’s
straight-line oscillation in the Coulomb potential of a ﬁnite-size nucleus a
“Coulomb oscillator.”

II. HYDROGEN ATOM

For the formal treatment of the non-relativistic Coulomb oscillator we
designate the z axis along the line orbit, with turning points at z =
Γ and
nuclear position at z = 0 (see Fig. 2). The electron’s total energy E at
position z must equal the potential energy at a turning point,

Figure 3 displays its dependence on the axial position as a two-wing curve
cusped at the nucleus. Atomic units (a.u.) are used, that is, the Bohr radius
rB and the “Bohr speed” vB = 2πe2/h = αc—the electron speed in the
ground-state Bohr orbit of the H atom—with ﬁne-structure constant α

1/137 and speed of light c. The curve’s wing along the positive z axis,

Here pr is the radial momentum, nr = 1, 2, ... is the radial quantum number,

illustrated in Fig. 3 by the area under one wing of the speed curve. For a

In order to express the radial quantization in terms of axial motion we

The concept of the electron’s semiclassical Coulomb oscillation is consis-
tent with the Fermi-contact term of hyperﬁne interaction for l = 0 states,
which arises from the presence of the electron inside the nucleus. This is
familiar from quantum mechanics11 and can be interpreted semiclassically as
a local-ﬁeld eﬀect.12

To be sure, the extension of Sommerfeld’s theory by the Coulomb oscil-
lator resolves the discrepancy of the old quantum theory with spectroscopy,
mentioned above, only at the low end of angular quantum numbers, l = 0.
The resolution at the high end—repeal of the circular Bohr orbit, l
= n—
involves an analysis in terms of space quantization which is beyond the scope
of the present study.

III. HYDROGEN MOLECULE ION

A. Formalism

A hydrogen molecule ion, H +

2 , consists of two proton nuclei and one
electron. We assume, in adiabatic approximation, the protons located at ﬁxed
positions z =
c on the molecular axis (see Fig. 4). The term “Coulomb
oscillator” denominates again the motion of a point electron, now along either
C, or along
the line through the protons (z axis) and with turning points
the perpendicular line through the midpoint (y axis) with turning points
B.

well as any proton-proton distance R between, we keep the action constant,

A = Az + Ay = nh.
Equation (16) is the Einstein quantization condition13—a generalization of
Sommerfeld’s quantization over separable variables—where the quantum sum
equals the sum of action integrals over topologically independent paths in
phase space.14

Here we treat the molecule ion only in its ground state, n = 1. Analytic
solutions of the action integrals, Eqs. (10ab) and (14), are complicated due
to elliptic functions. We therefore integrate numerically and visualize the
integrals by the area under the corresponding speed curves. The bold curve
in Fig. 5 shows the axial electron speed v(z) for a far proton separation,
R = 6 rB. The electron, in its semiclassical motion, then oscillates only about
(and through) the right proton. The area under the speed curve, Eq. (8ab),
v(z)dz = φh,
proportionally represents the ground state’s unity of action, m
with a fold-out factor φ = 2 in analogy to the free-atom case, Eq. (4). The
thin curve shows, for comparison, the axial electron speed in a free H atom—
familiar from Fig. 3—centered at the same proton position, +c. The pull
c) on the oscillating electron can be seen by the
from the left proton (at
distortion of the speed function v(z) and the redistribution of the area under
the curve.

When, with closer proton separation R, as in Fig. 6, the electron swings
past the midpoint 0, then the single-cusp speed curve v(z) from Fig. 5—
akin in shape to letter Λ—becomes double-cusped (akin to letter M) and
symmetric with respect to the bisector (y axis). Now there is also a lateral
oscillation with speed u(y) having the same total energy E. The equality of
E in both cases can be seen in Fig. 6 by the equality of axial and lateral speed
at the midpoint, v(0) = u(0)—a position where the electron experiences the
same potential in either case. For convenience the lateral speed u(y), though
perpendicular to the proton axis, is displayed in Fig. 6 together with the axial
speed v(z). The lateral speed curve u(y), drawn dotted, is readily recognized
). At the bifurcation value of the proton separation, ˇR,
by its dome shape (
where the electron starts swinging though the midpoint 0, the axial speed
curve v(z) changes from its one-centered Λ shape to a two-centered M shape.
The area under the axial speed curve then abruptly doubles, M( ˇR
≈
−
2Λ( ˇR + δ), upon a very small change in proton separation, δ
ˇR. In order
to keep the action integral continuous at ˇR, the sudden area doubling is
compensated by a corresponding doubling of the fold-out factor from φ = 2
for R > ˇR to φ = 4 for R < ˇR. The same fold-out factor, φ = 4, must be
used for the lateral action integral Ay, Eq. (14), as will become clear shortly.
The unity of action, A = 1h, is visualized again in Fig. 6. To this end we
compare the right half of the bold M-shape curve of axial electron speed in
the molecule with the thin curve Λ(H) of the axial speed in a free H atom
positioned at the right nucleus, +c. Due to attraction from the left nucleus,

the right wing of the M curve is smaller than that of Λ(H) by the area of
lobe L. On the other hand, the left ﬂank of the Λ(H) curve that extends over
the negative z axis is smaller than the left wing of the lateral speed curve
by the area of slice S. The area under the free-atom curve is then

The results of the Coulomb-oscillator approach will be compared with
another semiclassical calculation of H +
2 , by Strand and Reinhardt.15 These
authors, like Pauli,4 separate the equation of motion in spheroidal coordi-
nates, ξ = (r+ + r−)/2c , η = (r+
r−)/2c and ϕ by virtue of the constants
of the motion: total energy E, angular momentum M about the z axis, and
a component of the bifocal Runge-Lenz vector, Ωc.16 Here r+ (r−) is the
distance of the electron from the nucleus at +c (
c). Strand and Reinhardt
(SR) solve the ensuing one-dimensional diﬀerential equations with classical
Poisson-bracket techniques. They ﬁnd the electron’s trajectories condition-
ally periodic17 and regionally conﬁned due to restrictions from E, M and Ωc.
However, unlike Pauli, who used Sommerfeld quantization, SR employ the
Einstein-Brillouin-Keller (EBK) quantization conditions,

The background of EBK quantization touches on the foundations of clas-
sical and quantum mechanics.18 For the present purpose its essential rationale
may be summarized as follows: A semiclassical treatment envolves turning
points of radial, or other librating motion. Any tunneling through “forbid-
den” regions of negative kinetic energy is ruled out. Viewed in terms of the
quantum mechanical WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation, the
hard reﬂection of a wavefunction at a turning point corresponds to a so-called
“loss” of phase (phase shift by π) compared to the soft reﬂection caused by
tunneling (phase shift by π/2 ). This shortcoming can be remedied with
EBK quantization conditions by addition of a value of 1/4, for each libra-
tional turning point, to the corresponding quantum number. Such is the case
for the electron’s elliptical and hyperbolic librations in the above quantiza-
tion, Eq. (19ab), but not for a rotation about the z axis, Eq. (19c). Strand
and Reinhardt call these quantization conditions “primitive” to distinguish
them from more sophisticated ones, speciﬁed below.

A semiclassical treatment of a free H atom with EBK quantization has
recently been presented in these pages.19 In this case the isotropic symmetry
permits a separation of variables in spherical coordinates, r, θ and ϕ, and
the EBK quantization conditions are like Eqs. (19abc) except for j = r, θ.
The atomic ground state is characterized by the quantum numbers (nr, nθ,
nϕ) = (0, 0, 0). Accordingly, the action in the atom’s ground state, A1 = 1h,
is attributed only to tunneling at the radial and latitudinal turning points
(the former being the nucleus). Applying EBK quantization to the ground
state of H +
2 , denoted 1sΣg in molecular spectroscopy, SR likewise assign the
quantum numbers (nξ, nη, nϕ) = (0, 0, 0).

parison with exact quantum mechanical (QM) results and the semiclassical
calculation by SR.15 The lower part of Fig. 7 shows the electronic energy
Eel(R) of the ground state, 1sΣg. At large proton separations, R > 6 rB,
both the SR calculation (circles) and the CO approach (crosses) agree ex-
cellently with the exact QM values (curve). This is the situation where the
electron stays near one nucleus (see Fig. 5). As Fig. 7 further shows, such
agreement ceases once the classical electron motion leads beyond the molec-
ular bisector, which happens for proton separations below the bifurcation
value, R < ˇR
5.57 rB (see Fig. 6). Interestingly, the deviations of CO
and SR from QM are opposite over the entire range. The SR results are
discontinuous at a certain proton separation, R∗
1.38 rB. Remarkably, at
(or near) that value, R∗, the CO energy crosses the curve of the QM solution.
Adding to the electronic energy Eel the proton-proton repulsion gives the
total energy E, Eq. (15). The middle part of Fig. 7 shows by the dashed
curve the exact total energy E(R) of the 1sΣg ground state, obtained from
QM and, by symbols, the corresponding CO and SR values. The solid dot at
the minimum of the curve shows the QM equilibrium energy, in agreement
1.20 Ry, and the equilibrium internuclear distance,
with experiment, E0 =
R0 = 2.00 rB. The CO energy (
) comes out too low, due to the inaccuracy

of its Eel, with an equilibrium value E0(CO)
rB. Conversely, the SR energy ((cid:3)) comes out too high with E0(SR)
1.05
Ry at R0(SR)
5 rB. Since the CO and SR results deviate about equal and

oppositely from QM, their average (♦) is close to the exact values with a

the constituting atoms, here, E0(H +

atom, E(H) =

Both semiclassical treatments, CO and (barely) SR, yield molecular binding
energies with negative values and thus a stable molecule ion. Why are
they more successful than the early attempts, in the 1920s, by Pauli,4 and
independently Niessen,20 with the Sommerfeld quantization conditions of the
old quantum theory?

than the ground state of a free hydrogen atom, they give rise to positive

bility is borne out by quantum mechanics for this exited state of H +
2 (Pauli’s
argument4 about “dynamical stability” notwithstanding). The deviation of
their historical value (
) from the (dotted) QM curve is remarkably small—
comparable to those of the CO and SR results for the ground state. Pauli’s
and Niessen’s misfortune, though, was that they misinterpreted their result
as the molecule ion’s ground state—an assessment with fateful consequences
in the development of quantum theory.

C. Discussion

Why do the semiclassical results of the Coulomb oscillator and of SR’s
quantization deviate from the QM solution of the H +
2 molecule ion? Strand
and Reinhardt explain the deviation of their primitive quantization from QM
with eﬀective potential barriers arising from constrictions due to conserva-
tion of both the energy E and the bifocal Runge-Lenz component Ωc (the
angular momentum vanishes for the ground state, M = 0). The most drastic
consequence of those barriers is the discontinuity of Eel at R∗ (see Fig. 7)
and the large deviations at closer proton separation, R < R∗. While the sim-
ulation of quantum mechanical tunneling beyond the semiclassical turning
points of librations is adequately achieved by EKB quantization under the
isotropic symmetry of a free H atom,19 Eq. (19) is less successful under the
lower symmetry of H +
2 . When SR remedy the situation with “uniﬁed” semi-
classical quantization conditions, then Eel agrees, for all practical purposes,
with QM. Those uniﬁed quantization condition, going well beyond Eq. (19),
are sophisticated in their dependence on Eel, Ωc, and the hyperbolic turning
points η±. They will not be discussed here.

The reason for the deviation of the CO results from the QM values is the
neclect of the electron’s wave nature in the underlying quantization condition,
In proposing his wave hypothesis de Broglie22 already showed
Eq.
that the quantization condition of the Bohr model, An = nh, is equivalent

and the speed v(z′) from Eq. (2). This de Broglie wave, shown by the line
curve in Fig. 8 for a free H atom positioned at +c, has a node at the nucleus
and at each turning point. By the above characterization, those turning
points are “soft,” and it is their softness that ensures the exact energy of the
free atom. However, when Eq. (20ab) is applied to H +
2 for proton separations
beyond the bifurcation value, R > ˇR, with axial speed from Eq.

and integration away from the occupied nucleus,
wave is found to be “truncated” (no nodes) at both the outer and inner
turning point (see Fig. 8, small circles). Those turning points are “hard”
and give rise to incorrect energies. Qualitatively, an augmentation of the
truncated de Broglie wave with (exponential) “tunneling tails,” determined
by the negative kinetic energy in the classically “forbidden” region, would
“soften” the turning points. This would give rise to an eﬀective far turning
point farther out, Cef f > C, and accordingly raise the CO energy, Eq. (7),
toward the QM result.

R

When the proton separation is below bifurcation, R < ˇR, then Eq. (20b)
should be integrated from the midpoint 0 in both the axial and lateral direc-
tion rather than favoring one nucleus with the node of the de Broglie wave.
Again, the de Broglie wave is found to be truncated at the axial and lateral
turning points, C and B, respectively (see Fig. 9). An exception exits for
the proton separation R∗. The de Broglie wave, shown in Fig. 10, then has
a minimum at both turning points, w(C) = w(B) =
1, according to action
−
values of Az = 3
4h. Such turning points seem to be “benign”—
reminiscent of the soft turning points in the free-atom case—and cause the
CO energy Eel(R∗) in Fig. 7 to be exact. At still smaller proton separation,
R < R∗, the de Broglie wave is truncated again (not shown). The limit R = 0
corresponds to a Coulomb oscillator in the free He+ ion which, like in the

If the explanation that the CO energy Eel(R) deviates from the QM
curve because of the neglect of wave eﬀects is valid, then this sheds new light
on the SR results. The opposite sign of the CO and SR deviations then
suggests that SR’s primitive EBK quantization, while appropriate for a free
atom, simulates too much wave eﬀects under the lower symmetry of the H +
2
molecule ion. However, the average of both those semiclassical quantizations
seems to be an excellent compromise, as evidenced by the close agreement of
the corresponding total energy (♦) with the (dashed) QM curve in Fig. 7.

In conclusion, semiclassical quantization can rise to Gutzwiller’s chal-
lenge and “explain” the chemical bond in the paradigm molecule,23 H +
2 , by a
combination of classical mechanics, quantization, and moderate wave eﬀects.

Comment on: “Sadi Carnot on Carnot’s
theorem”.

Abstract

Carnot established in 1824 that the eﬃciency ηC of reversible en-
gines operating between a hot bath at absolute temperature Thot and
a cold bath at temperature Tcold is equal to 1−Tcold/Thot. Carnot par-
ticularly considered air as a working ﬂuid and small bath-temperature
diﬀerences. Plugging into Carnot’s expression modern experimental
values, exact agreement with modern Thermodynamics is found. How-
ever, in a recently published paper [“Sadi Carnot on Carnot’s theo-
rem”, Am. J. Phys. 70(1), 42–47, 2002], G¨u´emez and others consider
a “modiﬁed cycle” involving two isobars that they mistakenly attribute
to Carnot. They calculate an eﬃciency considerably lower than ηC
and suggest that Carnot made compensating errors. Our contention
is that the Carnot theory is, to the contrary, perfectly accurate.

Carnot established in 1824 [1] that the eﬃciency ηC of reversible engines op-
erating between a hot bath at absolute temperature Thot and a cold bath at
temperature Tcold is equal to 1 − Tcold/Thot. He particularly considered air
as a working ﬂuid and small bath-temperature diﬀerences. If one plugs into
Carnot’s expression modern experimental values one ﬁnds exact agreement
with the above formula. A recently published paper by G¨u´emez and others
[2] is useful in attracting attention to the early work on thermodynamics by
Carnot. However, the “modiﬁed Carnot cycle” that they consider, involving
two isobars, is not the one treated by Carnot. They calculate a considerably
lower eﬃciency and suggest that Carnot made conceptual errors and em-
ployed incorrect data, the agreement being achieved by coincidence only. To
the contrary, our contention is that the Carnot theory is perfectly accurate,
and that his numerical estimates are fairly good. A related discussion was
given in 1975 by Hoyer [3].

In his book “R´eﬂexions sur la puissance motrice du feu”, published in
1824, Carnot [1] presents calculations on the “motive power” of heat engines,
deﬁned as “the useful eﬀect that an engine is capable of producing. The eﬀect
can always be expressed in terms of a weight being raised to a certain height.
It is measured by the product of the weight and the height to which the
weight is considered to have to be raised”. Speciﬁcally, Carnot employed as
the mechanical energy unit the energy required to lift a cubic meter of water
by one meter in the earth gravitational ﬁeld, that is, 9.81 kJ. As far as heat
consumption is concerned, Carnot employed as a unit the heat required to
raise one kilogram of water from 0 to 1◦C (say, at constant pressure). Thus,
the Carnot unit for heat is equal to 4.18 kJ.

Carnot [1, p. 80] considers an ideal heat engine whose working agent
is a cylinder containing 1 kg of air initially at atmospheric pressure p=10.4
meters of water. The cold bath temperature is Tcold=0◦C while the hot
bath temperature Thot=1◦C 1. Let us postpone physical explanations and
consider the values of the work W performed per cycle and the hot-bath

to 1◦C.

in nearly exact agreement with the Carnot eﬃciency ηC = 1 − Tcold/Thot ≈
1/273.15 = 0.00366.

The reasoning that led Carnot to the expression in (1) is sound. Figure
1 shows the reversible cycle 1-2-3-4-1 considered by Carnot in the pressure-
volume diagram. The vertical axis corresponds to the change of pressure
in the air-ﬁlled cylinder with respect to atmospheric pressure p0, while the
horizontal axis corresponds to the change in cylinder volume with respect to
the volume at atmospheric pressure and T = 0◦C, namely V0 = 0.773 cubic
meters. Because the relative changes of temperature and volume are small the
cycle is a parallelogram. For obvious geometrical reasons the work performed
per cycle, that is, the area enclosed in the parallelogram, is: W = ∆p ∆V ,
where ∆p and ∆V are shown in the ﬁgure. This is also the area enclosed in
the rectangular path shown in the ﬁgure. Let us emphasize, however, that
this path is not the cycle considered by Carnot.

∆p is the change of pressure required to increase the temperature of 1 kg of
air from 0 to 1◦C, the volume being kept constant (path 4-4′). This quantity
had been measured at Carnot’s time by Gay-Lussac. The recent value is
∆p = p0/273.15, where p0 = 10.34 meters of water. Carnot introduced the
ratio γ of air speciﬁc heats at constant pressure and constant volume, which
is also the ratio of the isothermal and isentropic compressibilities (see, for
example, [4, p. 272]). According to the ﬁgure, the ratio of the slopes of the
isotherms and adiabats is γ = (1/109.3 + 1/273.15)/(1/109.3) = 1.400 =
7/5. This is indeed the ratio of constant-pressure to constant-volume heat
capacities of di-atomic molecules such as those comprising air (oxygen and

2

nitrogen) in the temperature range considered. A slightly larger value of γ
was used by Carnot on the basis of the sound-velocity measurements made
at the time. Thus the volume change ∆V = (1/109.3 + 1/273.15) V0, where
V0 = 0.773 cubic meters.

To obtain the amount of heat Q supplied by the hot bath, Carnot noted
that for small temperature diﬀerences the work performed is negligible com-
pared to the heat consumption. It follows that one may assume, for that part
of the calculation, that the heat received by the system almost vanishes in a
closed cycle. Consider now the cycle 1-2-4-1 (triangular path). By deﬁnition,
no heat is being transfered to the ﬂuid along the adiabat 4-1. Therefore, the
amount of heat Q received by the system along the path 1-2 is equal to the
heat received along the path 4-2. The latter is the heat required to raise the
temperature of 1 kg of air from 0 to 1◦C at (constant) atmospheric pressure.
Experimental values for this quantity were known at Carnot’s time.

Carnot also correctly noted that, for small temperature diﬀerences, essen-
tially the same values of W and Q are obtained if the cylinder volume is kept
constant when being transfered from one bath to the other, that is, adiabats
may be replaced by isochores, in that limit. However, when the cylinder is
kept in contact with a bath and its volume changes as shown in the ﬁgure,
the pressure necessarily varies. This is why the description of the Carnot
cycle given in [1] “The cycle used by Carnot was composed of two isobarics
and two isochorics” is erroneous. It is then not surprising that these authors
calculate a much lower eﬃciency, namely, η = 0.00089, using modern data,
and misinterpret the nature of Carnot’s contribution, as far as air or other
nearly ideal gases are concerned.

Carnot gave in a manuscript the mechanical equivalent of heat according
to: 1 kilo-calorie of heat=370 kg.m (instead of the modern value of 426 kg.m
corresponding to 1 calorie of heat=4.18 J). Because the energy of ideal gases
depends on temperature only, Q is equal to the work ∆V p0 done along the
isothermal path 1-2. If we replace Q in (1) by ∆V p0, ∆V drops out and we
obtain, using the ideal gas law pV /T =constant, η = ∆p/p0 = 1 − Tcold/Thot.
Readers interested in the history of Thermodynamics would do well in
reading the La Mer papers (reference 6 of the commented paper) that ap-
peared long ago in this journal.

Figure 1: This ﬁgure represents at scale the reversible cycle (1-2-3-4-1) for air,
considered by Carnot. Recent experimental values are shown. At the origin
of the diagram (T = 0◦C) the pressure is p0=10.34 meters of water and the
volume is V0 = 0.773 cubic meters. The work performed is equal to the area
enclosed in the paralelogram, also equal to the area enclosed in the rectangle,
namely: W = ∆V ∆p. The heat consumption Q is approximately equal to
the heat required to heat air from 0◦C to 1◦C at atmospheric pressure. The
cycle eﬃciency η ≈ 1/273.15.

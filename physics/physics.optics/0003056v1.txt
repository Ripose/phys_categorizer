Axicon Gaussian Laser Beams

Kirk T. McDonald

Joseph Henry Laboratories, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544

(March 14, 2000)

1 Problem

Deduce an axicon solution for Gaussian laser beams, i.e., one with radial polarization of the
electric ﬁeld.

2 Solution

If a laser beam is to have radial transverse polarization, the transverse electric must vanish
on the symmetry axis, which is charge free. However, we can expect a nonzero longitudinal
electric ﬁeld on the axis, considering that the rays of the beam that converge on its focus each
has polarization transverse to the ray, and hence the projections of their electric ﬁelds onto
the axis all have the same sign. This contrasts with the case of linearly polarized Gaussian
laser beams [2, 3, 4, 5] for which rays at 0◦ and 180◦ azimuth to the polarization direction
have axial electric ﬁeld components of opposite sign. The longitudinal electric ﬁeld of axicon
laser beams may be able to transfer net energy to charged particles that propagate along
the optical axis, providing a form of laser acceleration [6, 7, 8].

Although two of the earliest papers on Gaussian laser beams [9, 10] discuss axicon modes
(without using that term, and without deducing the simplest axicon mode), most subse-
quent literature has emphasized linearly polarized Gaussian beams. We demonstrate that
a calculation that begins with the vector potential (sec. 2.1) leads to both the lowest order
linearly polarized and axicon modes. We include a discussion of Gaussian laser pulses as
well as continuous beams, and ﬁnd condition (8) for the temporal pulse shape in sec. 2.2.
The paraxial wave equation and its lowest-order, linearly polarized solutions are reviewed in
secs. 2.3-4. Readers familiar with the paraxial wave equation for linearly polarized Gaussian
beams may wish to skip directly to sec. 2.5 in which the axicon mode is displayed. In sec. 2.6
we ﬁnd an expression for a guided axicon beam, i.e., one that requires a conductor along the
optical axis.

2.1 Solution via the Vector Potential

Many discussions of Gaussian laser beams emphasize a single electric ﬁeld component such
as Ex = f (r, z)ei(kz−ωt) of a cylindrically symmetric beam of angular frequency ω and wave
number k = ω/c propagating in vacuum along the z axis. Of course, the electric ﬁeld must
satisfy the free-space Maxwell equation ∇ · E = 0. If Ey = 0, we must then have nonzero
Ez. That is, the desired electric ﬁeld has more than one vector component.
To be able to deduce all components of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of a Gaussian
laser beam from a single scalar wave function, we follow the suggestion of Davis [11] and
seek solutions for a vector potential A that has only a single component. We work in the

1

Lorentz gauge (and Gaussian units), so that the scalar potential Φ is related to the vector
potential by

∇ · A +

1
c

∂Φ
∂t

= 0.

(1)

The vector potential can therefore have a nonzero divergence, which permits solutions having
only a single component. Of course, the electric and magnetic ﬁelds can be deduced from
the potentials via

and

E = −∇Φ −

1
c

∂A
∂t

,

(2)

(3)

B = ∇ × A.

For this, the scalar potential must ﬁrst be deduced from the vector potential using the
Lorentz condition (1).

The vector potential satisﬁes the free-space wave equation,

∇2A =

1
c2

∂2A
∂t2 .

(4)

We seek a solution in which the vector potential is described by a single component Aj that
propagates in the +z direction with the form

(5)
where the spatial envelope ψ is azimuthally symmetric, r⊥ = √x2 + y2, g is the temporal
pulse shape, and the phase ϕ is given by

Aj(r, t) = ψ(r⊥, z)g(ϕ)eiϕ,

Inserting trial solution (5) into the wave equation (4) we ﬁnd that

ϕ = kz − ωt.

∇2ψ + 2ik

g ! = 0,

where g′ = dg/dϕ.

(6)

(7)

2.2 A Condition on the Temporal Pulse Shape g(ϕ)

Since ψ is a function of r while g and g′ are functions of the phase ϕ, eq. (7) cannot be
satisﬁed in general. Often the discussion is restricted to the case where g′ = 0, i.e., to
continuous waves. We learn that a pulsed laser beam must obey

g′ ≪ g.

(8)

It is noteworthy that a “Gaussian” laser beam cannot have a Gaussian temporal pulse.
That is, if g = exp[−(ϕ/ϕ0)2], then g′/g = −2ϕ/ϕ2
0, which does not satisfy condition (8) for
|ϕ| large compared to the characteristic pulsewidth ϕ0 = ω∆t, i.e., in the tails of the pulse.
A more appropriate form for a pulsed beam is a hyperbolic secant (as arises in studies of
solitons):

Then, g′/g = −(1/ϕ0) tanh(ϕ/ϕ0), which is less than one everywhere provided that ϕ0 ≫ 1.

g(ϕ) = sech  ϕ

ϕ0! .

(9)

2.3 The Paraxial Wave Equation

In the remainder of this paper, we suppose that condition (8) is satisﬁed. Then, the diﬀer-
ential equation (7) for the spatial envelope function ψ becomes

∇2ψ + 2ik

∂ψ
∂z

= 0.

(10)

The function ψ can and should be expressed in terms of three geometric parameters of a
focused beam, the diﬀraction angle θ0, the waist w0, and the depth of focus (Rayleigh range)
z0, which are related by

θ0 =

w0
z0

=

2

kw0

,

and

z0 =

kw2
0

We therefore work in the scaled coordinates

ξ =

υ =

ρ2 =

= ξ2 + υ2,

and

Changing variables and noting relations (11), eq. (10) takes the form

∂ς 2 = 0,

since ψ is independent of the azimuth φ.

This form suggests the series expansion

(13)

(15)

in terms of the small parameter θ2

Equation (16) is called the the paraxial wave equation, whose solution is well-known to

be

where

ψ0 = f e−f ρ2

(19)

The factor e−i tan−1 ς in f is the so-called Guoy phase shift [2], which changes from 0 to π/2
as z varies from 0 to ∞, with the most rapid change near the z0
in [12].

The solution to eq. (17) for ψ2 has been given in [11], and that for ψ4 has been discussed

With the lowest-order spatial function ψ0 in hand, we are nearly ready to display the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds of the corresponding Gaussian beams. But ﬁrst, we need the
scalar potential Φ, which we suppose has the form

similar to that of the vector potential. Then,

Φ(r, t) = Φ(r)g(ϕ)eiϕ,

∂Φ

g ! ≈ −ωΦ,

assuming condition (8) to be satisﬁed. In that case,

Φ = −

in view of condition (8). Note that (1/k)∂/∂x = (θ0/2)∂/∂ξ, etc., according to eqs. (11)-(12).

in Figs. 1 and 2.

The ﬁelds (25)-(26) satisfy ∇ · E = 0 = ∇ · B plus terms of order θ2
0.
Clearly, a vector potential with only a y component of form similar to eq. (24) leads to

the lowest-order Gaussian beam with linear polarization in the y direction.

2.5 The Lowest-Order Axicon Beam

An advantage of our solution based on the vector potential is that we also can consider the
case that only Az is nonzero and has the form (18),

Then,

Az =

(30)

(31)

using eqs. (11)-(12) and the fact that df /dς = −if 2, which follows from eq. (19). Anticipating
that the electric ﬁeld has radial polarization, we work in cylindrical coordinates, (r⊥, φ, z),
and ﬁnd from eqs. (3), (23), (30) and (31) that

geiϕ + O(θ2
0),

E⊥ = E0ρf 2e−f ρ2
Eφ = 0,
Ez = iθ0E0f 2(1 − f ρ2)e−f ρ2

The magnetic ﬁeld is

B⊥ = 0,

Bz = 0.

(33)
The ﬁelds Ex and Ez are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The dislocation seen in Fig. 4 for ρ ≈ ς is
due to the factor 1 − f ρ2 that arises in the paraxial approximation, and would, I believe, be
smoothed out on keeping higher-order terms in the expansion (15).

Bφ = E⊥,

Figure 3: The electric ﬁeld Er(r⊥, 0, z) of an axicon Gaussian beam with
diﬀraction angle θ0 = 0.45, according to eq. (32).

The transverse electric ﬁeld is radially polarized and vanishes on the axis. The longitu-
dinal electric ﬁeld is nonzero on the axis. Near the focus, Ez ≈ iθ0E0 and the peak radial
ﬁeld is E0/√2e = 0.42E0. For large z, E⊥ peaks at ρ = ς/√2, corresponding to polar angle
θ = θ0/√2. For angles near this, |E⊥| ≈ ρ|f|2 ≈ 1/z, as expected in the far zone. In this
region, the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse ﬁelds is Ez/E⊥ ≈ −iθ0f ρ ≈ −r⊥/z, as
expected for a spherical wave front.
The factor f 2 in the ﬁelds implies a Guoy phase shift of e−2i tan−1 ς, which is twice that

of the lowest-order linearly polarized beams.

It is noteworthy that the simplest axicon mode (32)-(33) is not a member of the set of
Gaussian modes based on Laguerre polynomials in cylindrical coordinates (see, for example,
sec. 3.3b of [1]).

2.6 Guided Axicon Beam

We could also consider the vector potential
Ar⊥ ∝ ψ0geiϕ,

which leads to the electric and magnetic ﬁelds

Aφ = Az = 0,

(34)

Er = E0f e−f ρ2

geiϕ, Eφ = 0, Ez = −iθ0f ρEr,

Br = 0, Bφ = Er, Bz = 0,

(35)

and the potential

which leads to

Ar⊥ = 0,

Aφ ∝ ψ0geiϕ,

Az = 0,

(36)

Er = 0, Eφ = E0f e−f ρ2

geiϕ, Ez = 0,

Br = −Eφ, Bφ = 0, Bz = −iθ0

1 − 2f ρ2

2ρ

Eφ. (37)

The case of eqs. (36)-(37) is unphysical due to the blowup of Bz as r⊥ → 0.
The ﬁelds of eqs. (34)-(35) do not satisfy ∇ · E = 0 at r⊥ = 0, and so cannot correspond
to a free-space wave. However, these ﬁelds could be supported by a wire, and respresent a

8

TM axicon guided cylindrical wave with a focal point. This is in contrast to guided plane
waves whose radial proﬁle is independent of z [13, 14]. Guided axicon beams might ﬁnd
application when a focused beam is desired at a point where a system of lenses and mirrors
cannot conveniently deliver the optical axis, or in wire-guided atomic traps [15]. Figures
1 and 2 show the functional form of the guided axicon beam (35), when coordinate x is
reinterpreted as r⊥.

Enhanced transmissions through a gold ﬁlm with arrays of subwavelength holes are
theoretically studied, employing the rigid full vectorial three dimensional ﬁnite diﬀerence
time domain method. Inﬂuence of air-holes shape to the transmission is ﬁrstly studied,
which conﬁrms two diﬀerent resonances attributing to the enhanced transmission: the
localized waveguide resonance and periodic surface plasmon resonances. For the ﬁlm
coated with dielectric layers, calculated results show that in the wavelength region of
interest the localized waveguide resonant mode attributes to sensing rather than the
periodic gold-glass surface plasmon mode. Although the detected peak is fairly broad
and the shift is not too pronounced, we emphasize the contribution for sensing from
the localized waveguide resonant mode, which may opens up new ways to design surface
plasmon based sensors.

1 Introduction

In the recent years, the demonstration of a strong and unexpected enhancement of light
transmission through arrays of subwavelength holes has generated numerous experimental
and theoretical work [1–9]. Although there are still continuing discussions about the
physical mechanisms responsible for the extraordinary transmission, many researchers
show that the enhanced transmission is attributed to the resonances. A surface plasmon
(SP) is a collective oscillation of free electrons inside a metal-dielectric surface. Strong
conﬁnement of plasmonic waves near the metal surface provides possibility for enhancing
interactions with an analyte layer and thus for eﬃcient sensing of surface binding events.

Surface plasmon (SP) sensors are widely used in chemical and biological research [10].
Conventional SP sensors, employing Kretschmann conﬁguration, usually operate in SP-
based attenuation total internal refraction. Recently, there has been a growing interest in
surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing of biochemicals using nanohole arrays [11–13].
These SP sensors are based on the enhanced transmission through arrays of nanoholes.
It is a general consensus that these sensors are based on SPRs, while the particular
nature of the SPR and the mechanism behind the sensing is still a questing open for
discussion. In this paper, we will theoretically study the transmission through arrays of
nanoholes and point out the contribution for sensing from the localized waveguide resonant
mode utilizing the rigid full-vectorial three-dimensional (3D) ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain
(FDTD) method.

2 Calculations and discussion

Consider a gold (Au) ﬁlm patterned with a periodic square array of rectangular air holes.
The Au ﬁlm, assumed to be on a glass substrate (ε=2.117), has a thickness of h=200
nm in the z direction, the dimensions of the holes in xy directions are denoted by Lx
× Ly, and the lattice constant is denoted by L. The insets in Fig. 1 show the corre-
sponding structure with cross sections in the xy and yz planes, where the green region
represents the substrate while red for the metal. For a similar structure, it has been
pointed out [8, 9] that there are two diﬀerent resonances attributing to the enhanced
transmission: (i) localized waveguide resonances where each air hole can be considered as
a low-quality-factor resonator, and (ii) well-recognized surface plasmon resonances due to
the periodicity. These results have been explained well by the band structure theory [9].
To further support these explanation, here we study the transmission through the Au
ﬁlm with periodic square arrays of diﬀerent air-holes shape. Consider the case of normal
incidence, and the electric ﬁeld of the incident wave is polarized along the short edge of
the rectangular holes (the x direction). Transmission through the ﬁlm is calculated by the
time-domain auxiliary diﬀerential equation approach combining 3D FDTD models of a
dispersive material [14, 15]. The dielectric function of Au is described by the lossy Drude
model

where ε∞ and ε0 are the relative permittivities at inﬁnite and zero frequency, respectively,
ωp is the plasma frequency, and νc is the collision frequency. We choose ε∞=12.18,
ε0=12.75, ωp=1.916×1016rad/s, and νc = 1.406 × 1014rad/s for the Drude model, which
ﬁts the experimental data [16] quite well.

Figure 1 shows the transmission through the gold ﬁlm with a square array of rectangular
holes with diﬀerent sizes in the xy directions. The peak in the transmission at the wave-
length λ = 617nm hardly moves with varying the air-holes shape, while, the position of

another peak is strongly dependant on the air-holes shape. For normally incident light
through arrays of sub-wavelength holes, to a good approximation the resonance wave-
lengths are given by a standing-wave quantization of the surface plasmon dispersion for
a smooth ﬁlm at normal incidence [1, 2],

Here, L is the periodicity of the array, ε1 is the dielectric constant of the interface medium,
ε2 is that of the metal, and i and j are integers deﬁning the diﬀerent diﬀraction orders.
Certainly, each interface can sustain SPs and the transmission spectra contain two sets
of peaks associated with each surface. In accordance with Eq. (2), we conclude that the
peak around 617 nm in Fig. 1, due to periodic surface plasmon wave, is related to the
(1,0) Au-glass resonance. For the Au-air resonant modes, the resonant wavelengths are
always less than 425 nm, which are not considered in this paper. The peak related to
the surface plasmon mode, hardly shifts when varying the size of the air holes, which can
be explained well by Eq. (2). On the other hand, another resonant mode, corresponding
to the localized waveguide resonant mode signiﬁcantly depends on the hole size, which
is naturally understood by the resonant condition. Both results shown in Fig. 1 coincide
with those mentioned in Ref. [9], which gives another explanation for the mechanism of
the enhanced transmission.

As mentioned above, the response of the SP is very sensitive to the refractive index in
the vicinity of the metal surface. Hence, simply placing a thin layer on a hole array will
shift the position of its transmission peaks. Consider a structure with yz cross section
shown in the inset of Fig. 2. The dimensions of the holes in xy directions are 225 × 150
nm2 and the lattice constant is 425 nm. Other parameters correspond to those mentioned
in Fig. 1. Suppose the metal interface is covered by a uniform layer (blue region), with
a height of w=25 nm, see inset of Fig. 2. Figure 2 shows transmission spectra for the
Au ﬁlm being covered by a uniform layer with a refractive index increasing from n=1.0
to n=1.5 in steps of 0.1. One can see clearly that the peak, around 617 nm, does not
shift when varying the refractive index of the attached layer. As seen from Eq. (2), the
resonant peak (617 nm), related to the (1,0) Au-glass resonance, only depends on the
lattice constant and the eﬀective refractive index at the metal-glass interface. Obviously,
it is independent on the coverage of the Au-air interface, i.e. this resonant mode is not
a candidate for a SPR sensor. We emphasize that the simulation results agree well with
It should be noted that the surface plasmon
theoretical ones obtained from Eq. (2).
resonant modes on the Au-air surface depend on the refractive index of the layer attached
to the surface, so that the SPR can be used as a sensor. However, in this paper, we do
not consider these modes since they fall outside our wavelength region of interest. On the
other hand, peaks, corresponding to the localized waveguide modes, signiﬁcantly shift due
to the change of the refractive index of the layer. As mentioned above, each air hole can be

3

considered to be a section of metallic waveguide with both ends open to free space, forming
a low-quality-factor resonator. When varying the eﬀective refractive index of the layer
in air holes, the resonant condition changes and the corresponding peaks obviously shift.
The peak related to the localized waveguide mode shifts δλ =16 nm when the surface is
modulated from n=1.0 to n=1.1, thus giving potential for sensor applications. When we
further increase the height of the layer, the peak related to the periodic surface plasmon
wave hardly shifts while the peak for the localized waveguide mode is strongly sensitive
to the refractive index of the layer. The sensitivity becomes larger when increasing the
height of the layer. As an example, the shift becomes δλ =18 nm for the case of w=50
nm as shown in Fig. 3, when the surface is modiﬁed from n=1.0 to n=1.1. It was always
believed that only periodic surface plasmon resonant mode contributes to sensing for the

and the peak is quite broad. This may pave a new way to design SPR based sensors.

The analysis above demonstrates that the localized waveguide mode takes an impor-
tant role for the SPR based sensor. Furthermore, we recently found that for frequency-
independent dielectric-function structure the sensitivity is proportional to the ﬁlling factor
f , deﬁned by f =
[17]. The integral in the numerator of the ﬁlling factor
is restricted to the region containing the ﬂuid, or in the present case the dielectric layer,
while the other integral is over all space. The periodic surface plasmon mode shown above
is a (1,0) Au-glass resonance mode, where most of the energy is believed to be bound at
the Au-glass surface. Therefore, f is close to zero, i.e. the peak related to this mode will
not shift when the Au-air surface is modiﬁed, which is in agreement with the calculated
result in Fig. 2. To increase the sensitivity, we further consider the structure with air holes
being ﬁlled with dielectric media (blue region). Other parameters correspond to those in
Fig. 2. Figure 4 shows transmission spectra for the Au ﬁlm with air holes being ﬁlled by
diﬀerent materials with the refractive index increasing from n=1.0 to n=1.5 in steps of
0.1. Similar to the result in Fig. 2, the peak around 617 nm in Fig. 4 does not shift when
varying the refractive index of the media in the air holes, which agrees well with that
obtained from Eq. (2). On the other hand, the peak related to the localized waveguide
mode signiﬁcantly shifts due to the change of the refractive index of the media. As men-
tioned above, each air hole can be considered to be a low-quality-factor resonator. When
varying the refractive index of the media in the air holes, obviously the peak does shift.
Compared to the result shown in Fig. 2, the sensitivity becomes better as shown in Fig. 3.
The shift for the localized waveguide mode is around δλ =20 nm when the air holes (with
index n=1) are ﬁlled by a madia of index n=1.1. Due to the low quality-factor, f will
never be close to unity. If the quality factor of the waveguide resonator can be increased,
we believe that the sensitivity will become stronger since f will become larger. We note
that another peak starts to appear when the refractive index increases above 1.3, which is
also dependant on the refractive index of the medias as shown in Fig. 4. Quite naturally,

4

the high-order mode appears, corresponding to a high-order resonant waveguide mode
appearing in a cavity composed by metallic waveguide when increasing of the refractive
index of the material inside the cavity.

3 Concluding remarks

In this paper, we have studied transmission through arrays of subwavelength holes in
gold ﬁlms utilizing the rigid full-vectorial three-dimensional ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain
method. Based on the two diﬀerent resonance mechanism for the enhanced transmission,
our calculations show that in our wavelength range of interest, the localized waveguide
resonant mode attributes to sensing rather than periodic gold-glass surface plasmon reso-
nant modes. It was believed that only periodic surface plasmon resonant mode contributes
for sensing for the SPR based sensor. In this paper, we emphasize the contribution for
sensing from the localized waveguide mode. Although the detected peak is fairly broad
and the shift is not too pronounced, this may pave a new way to design of SPR based
sensors.

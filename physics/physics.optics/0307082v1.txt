Lithium thioindate (LiInS2) is a new nonlinear chalcogenide bi-axial material transparent from
0.4 to 12 µm, that has been successfully grown in large sizes and good optical quality. As a result of
a three-year intensive characterization campaign of its main properties, we report new and updated
physical parameters that are relevant for laser and nonlinear optics applications:
lattice phonon
vibrational spectra, thermal expansion and thermo-optic coeﬃcients, speciﬁc heat at constant pres-
sure, thermal conductivity, piezo-electric and electro-optic coeﬃcients, laser damage thresholds,
accurate optical linear dispersion and nonlinear second-order susceptibility coeﬃcients. We provide
also a detailed study of the in and out-of-principal plane phase-matching characteristics and asso-
ciated eﬀective nonlinear coeﬃcients. New experimental results on direct mid-IR (5 - 12 µm) down-
conversion (femtosecond parametric ampliﬁcation and continuous-wave (cw) diﬀerence-frequency
generation) pumped by Ti:sapphire laser sources are reported. As main advantages with respect to
existing ternary chalcopyrite mid-IR materials, LiInS2 displays one of the highest energy bandgaps,
a nearly-isotropic thermal expansion behavior, high thermal conductivity associated with high op-
tical damage thresholds, and a nonlinearity and transparency superior to those of the iso-structural
KTiOPO4.

INTRODUCTION

−

20 µm), a spectral range of

The intensive search for new nonlinear materials for
the generation of coherent tunable radiation in the mid-
IR (2
importance for
molecular spectroscopy, atmospheric sensing and vari-
ous opto-electronic devices, remains a continuing chal-
In contrast with the oxides (with IR transmis-
lenge.
sion range not exceeding
5 µm) that attracted much
∼
attention lately, such deep mid-IR materials cannot be
grown by well mastered and harmless hydrothermal,
ﬂux or Czochraski methods. Instead the more complex
Bridgman-Stockbarger growth technique [1]
in sealed
(high atmosphere) ampoules, with volatile and chemi-
cally reactive starting components, is the only method
used to produce large size single domain crystals, and
this certainly hampered their development all the more
that special post-growth treatments are needed to restore
stoichiometry and improve their optical quality.

To date, only few suitable nonlinear crystals combin-
ing an extended transparency from the visible/near-IR to
the deep mid-IR and large enough birefringence to allow
phase-matching over the whole transparency range are
available. The majority of these compounds belong to the
ternary chalcogenide semi-conductors of the AIBIIICVI
2
family, where A=Cu, Ag; B=Al, Ga, In; C=S, Se, Te [2].
Except for AgInS2, which can exist in both the tetrago-
nal and orthorhombic phases [3], these crystallize in the
chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) structure with I¯42d space group
and tetragonal symmetry (class) ¯42m but only few of
them possess suﬃcient birefringence. Most of the com-
mercially available nonlinear crystals (AgGaS2 or AGS,
AgGaSe2 or AGSe, ZnGeP2 or ZGP, GaSe, CdSe) or
more conﬁdential ones (HgGa2S4 or HGS, Ag3AsS3 or
proustite, Tl3AsSe3 or TAS) have their advantages and
drawbacks [4, 5]. Despite their higher nonlinearity com-
pared with the oxides, one limitation stems from their
low energy bandgap, which prevents the use of pump
lasers below 1 µm due to severe linear and two-photon
absorption and associated thermal eﬀects. ZGP has a
high nonlinearity (72 pm/V) and thermal conductivity
but requires pump wavelength above 2 µm due to its
residual absorption in the near-IR. The noble metal com-
pounds (AGS, AGSe) have the lowest residual absorp-
tion, but their poor thermal conductivity due to low-
energy phonon spectrum limits their performance, espe-
cially in cw applications [6, 7, 8, 9]. Furthermore, their
thermal expansion is anisotropic along the direction par-
allel and perpendicular to the optic axis, which is a source
of thermo-mechanical stresses. CdSe’s transparency ex-
tends up to 18µm but its low birefringence and nonlin-
earity limit its phase-matching capability. GaSe is a soft,
cleaving compound that cannot be cut at directions dif-
ferent from the optical axis, further its large birefringence
results in severe walkoﬀ limitations.

Two new materials belonging to the AIBIIICVI

2 chalco-
genide family, where the metal cations are replaced with
the lighter alkali metal (A=Li), can now be added to

2

C9

this limited list: LiInS2 or lithium thioindate (LIS) and
LiInSe2 or lithium selenoindate (LISe). They were shown
to crystallize with the β-NaFeO2 structure (orthorhom-
2v symmetry, point group mm2), which is
bic Pna21 ≡
a distorted superstructure of the wurtzite type, as early
as 1965 [10]. Hence, contrary to the other mid-IR com-
pounds, these new materials are biaxial and isostruc-
tural to, e.g., KTiOPO4 (KTP). The linear and non-
linear properties of LIS were brieﬂy studied by Boyd
and co-workers in the early 70’s, using small and poor
quality samples [11], but very few works (mainly focused
on its optical bandgap characterization and photolumi-
nescence spectra [12, 13, 14]) have followed since un-
til recently due to problems associated to its reliable
growth in large size (up to 20 mm in length) allowing
to design good optical quality single domain elements for
practical applications. These growth problems, associ-
ated with the high chemical activity of Li, were solved
recently [15] and large crystals of high optical quality
became available for practical nonlinear optical applica-
tions [16, 17, 18]. To our knowledge, there is only one
other group which has succeeded previously in synthe-
sizing this material with comparable size [19], but this
work was also stopped recently. While only non-phase-
matched second-harmonic generation (SHG) was used by
Boyd and co-workers to determine the nonlinear proper-
ties of LIS [11], the ﬁrst phase-matched SHG experiment
using the tunable output of a pulsed LiNbO3-OPO near
2.5 µm was reported only recently [16]. The range of
fundamental wavelength was extended to 6 µm using the
radiation from a free-electron laser and ZGP-frequency
doubler [17] and rough estimation of the eﬀective non-
linear coeﬃcients was extracted from those measure-
ments. Direct parametric down-conversion in the range
4.8
9 µm, using a femtosecond (200 fs) Ti:sapphire am-
pliﬁer as the pump source, was simultaneously reported
with an upper-bound value of the two-photon absorption
(TPA) at 800 nm of β=0.04 cm /GW [18], owing to the
high bandgap energy of LIS [13, 19, 20]. Such a value
is about 100 times less than the value for AGS or 1000
times less than for AGSe at 1.32 µm [21], for instance,
although some reversible gray-tracking phenomenon oc-
curred due to non-phase-matched blue second-harmonic
(SH) at higher pumping (Section XI).

−

These preliminary experiments allowed to assess the
potential of LIS over the existing mid-IR materials, and
justify the need for a complete characterization of its op-
tical properties. In this paper, we report the main results
of an intensive investigation campaign involving a net-
work of laboratories in Europe, on the characterization
of the main properties: absorption and thermal capacity
(Section III), vibrational (Section IV), thermal expan-
sion and thermo-optic coeﬃcients (Section V), electro-
optic and piezo-electric (Section VI), linear optical and
thermo-optic dispersions (Section VII), phase-matching
predictions (Section VIII), nonlinear coeﬃcients (Sec-
tion IX), parametric down-conversion (Section X) and
optical damage (Section XI) of LIS grown (Section II) at

one of the co-authors institute (Design and Technological
Institute of Monocrystals or DTIM). Given that LIS is
pyro-electric, the paper is concluded by preliminary at-
tempts to invert its macroscopic polarization by use of
an external electric ﬁeld. The preliminary work on LISe
has just started and will not be reported here [22].

II. GROWTH OF LITHIUM THIOINDATE

Single-domain crystals of LIS are grown by the
Bridgman-Stockbarger technique in a vertical setup with
counter-pressure on seeds along (001) and (010) direc-
tions [10, 11, 12, 15, 23, 24, 25]. From the literature
the melting point of LIS varies from Tmelt = 980◦C to
Tmelt = 1040◦C. The directed crystallization is performed
from a melt of elemental Li, In and S, unlike previous re-
ported methods that used Li, In2S3, and S [23, 24]. In
the melt zone the temperature is maintained at
1100 K
900 K in the growth zone. The phase
and decreases to
diagram as well as a representation of the chemical struc-
ture of this compound can be found in Ref. [25].

∼

−

15 K/cm at a rate of

Particular attention is paid to the purity of the start-
ing Li, In and S: these elements are with a nominal purity
of 99.999% for S and In, and 99.9% for Li. Sulfur is addi-
tionally puriﬁed by sublimation in dynamic or static vac-
uum while metals are cleaned by repeated zonal melting
and directed crystallization. A correction of the stoichio-
metric Li:In:S = 1:1:2 ratios is made taking into account
the diﬀering chemical stability of the elements to weight
loss during the runs, due to volatilization and interaction
between the melt and the container walls. To avoid Li in-
teraction with silica ampoules the synthesis is performed
in a special polished graphite crucible located inside a
silica ampoule. Some sulfur loss takes place because
of its interaction with the graphite walls. The charged
ampoules are moved in an optimal thermal gradient of
10
10 mm/day. This technique
∼
allows the growth of crystal ingots with diameters up to
20 mm and lengths up to 50mm. Although sometimes
colorless to a great extent, the as-grown ingots are usu-
ally milky because of small inclusions of various phases
and it is necessary to anneal them in Li2S or S2 vapor at
1000◦C)
temperature close to the melting point (Tmelt ∼
in order to remove the small opaque inclusions [15]. Since
the vapor composition and partial pressure of gaseous
species are unknown the optimal conditions for obtaining
high optical quality elements are empirically found run
after run. This empirical technique allows also to adjust
the deviation from stoichiometric composition in a nar-
row, up to
1 wt.%, range of component content. The
crystal coloration after the thermal post-growth treat-
ment changes then from almost colorless (or slightly yel-
low) for as-grown, to salmon-rose tinge depending on the
growth and post-growth treatment conditions and chem-
ical composition. Using X-ray diﬀraction technique par-
allelepipedic optical elements of a speciﬁed orientation
relative to the crystallographic axes are cut from the in-

gots (in regions of highest transparency). The optical
elements with aperture up to 1 cm2 and length up to
15 mm are then polished for optical measurements or for
nonlinear frequency conversion (Fig. 1).

A. Composition, structural and luminescence
properties

Precise chemical analysis - using diﬀerential dissolu-
tion techniques (DDT) and inductively-coupled plasma
(ICP) method - shows that the composition of color-
less (or yellow tinge) and rose samples is Li0.98In1.03S2.00
(Li0.96In1.06S1.98) and Li0.86In1.04S1.98 respectively [15].
Lithium deﬁcit (NLi : NIn < 1) is observed for all sam-
ples, the annealed rose ones being characterized by a
higher sulfur content (NLi+In : NS < 1). The band-
structure nature of LIS has been conﬁrmed to be of
the direct type (direct transitions between parabolic
bands) [13]. The forbidden band gap values estimated
by us (Eg = 3.72 and 3.57 eV at 80K and 300K, re-
spectively, which are in good agreement with previous
measurements [13, 19, 20]), the position of the long-wave
edge of transparency (13µm at an absorption of 6 cm−1)
and the crystal symmetry group were found identical for
all crystal colorations although small variations in lattice
parameters due to point defects were also observed [26].
A detailed and general structural analysis of AIBIIICVI
2
compounds, where AI
is an alkali metal such as Li,
has been given by Kish et al
[27]. Compared to the
denser chalcopyrite structure of AGS or AGSe [28], the
β-NaFeO2 structure of Li-chalcogenides allows the pres-
ence of empty cavities within the unit cell volume (see
Fig.1 in Ref. [29] for instance for the unit cell representa-
tion). The value of the orthorhombic lattice parameters
are a = 6.874(1)˚A, b = 8.033(2)˚A, c = 6.462(1)˚A for as-
grown colorless LIS, and a = 6.890(1)˚A, b = 8.053(1)˚A,
c = 6.478(1)˚A for slightly yellowish samples. They are
slightly lower than the values reported by Hoppe [10]
and Boyd et al [11] or Kamijoh et al [12] and Kish et
al [30], but most closely to the last one. They modify
to a = 6.896(1)˚A, b = 8.058(2)˚A, c = 6.484(4)˚A for rose
annealed samples. Concomitantly, the density changes
from ρ = 3.52g/cm3 to ρ = 3.44g/cm3. We have cho-

sen c < a < b where c is the polar two-fold axis which
coincides with the selection of Boyd et al [11]. This con-
vention satisﬁes the recommendation of Roberts [31] for
unique designation of the orthorhombic class mm2.

A fragment of the structure of LIS is shown in Fig. 2.
It is formed by LiS4 and InS4 tetrahedrons. The S2−
ions are arranged in hexagonal packing with tetragonal
and octahedral cavities (tetra- and octapores) [27]. Two
types of point defects can be assessed from the struc-
tural analysis:
lithium and sulfur vacancies (VLi, VS)
in as-grown samples, some of which recombine with Li,
S at annealing in S2 and Li2S vapor, and anti-site InLi
defects which are expected to be present in all samples.
Formation of the latter is possible thanks to close val-
ues of cation tetrahedral radii as R(Li+)4 = 0.59˚A and
R(In3+)4 = 0.66˚A. The VS defects give rise to a strong
absorption band at 363nm, whereas an intense broad-
band blue luminescence at 420-480nm, observed for most
of the crystals, is related to donor (InLi)-valence band
transition [13, 15]. The 585nm luminescence in samples
annealed in S2 vapor, is associated with donor (InLi)-
acceptor (VLi) transitions. From the energy level dia-
gram it follows that the energy level, relating to InLi
would be located at about 120 meV above that of VS
[12].

down-converting material [32]. Sulﬁdes are chemically
more stable than halogenides (such as KPb2Cl5 [33]) and
they can be used as hosts for laser action up to 6 mi-
crons, all the more advantageous since the phonon vi-
bration spectrum of LIS is restricted to phonon energies
~ωmax < 400 cm−1 (see Section IV). The dopant was
added as Nd2S3 during the growth process. The segre-
gation coeﬃcient was estimated to be about 0.02, and
the Nd concentration inside the crystal was determined
to be only
0.06 wt.% using spectral analysis with an
etalon. The RE doping hampered considerably the crys-
tal growth, since the Nd:LIS as-grown ingots were only
5 mm3 in size and much darker than for pure
5
LIS. The optical spectroscopy of the doped crystals con-
ﬁrmed the presence of Nd3+ active ions, both in absorp-
tion (presence of a set of weak lines centered at 760, 820
and 900 nm corresponding to electronic transitions from
the ground state 4I9/2 to manifolds as (4S3/2 +4 F7/2),
(2H9/2 +4 F5/2) and 4F3/2 in Nd3+) and in luminescence
(40-nm broad emission centered at 1080 nm and corre-
4 I11/2 lasing transition) [16, 32].
sponding to the 4F3/2 →
Nd doping was found to stimulate by one order of magni-
tude the blue photo-luminescence of pure crystals, mean-
ing that doping favors the formation of interstitial and
anti-site indium defects (InLi). From the intensity of
the absorption lines, a Nd3+ absorption cross-section of
10−20 cm2 has been inferred, roughly 3 times
σabs ∼
lower than the value in YAG [34].

III. RESIDUAL ABSORPTION AND SPECIFIC
HEAT OF LIS

The less dense β-NaFeO2 structure allows in partic-
ular doping with rare-earth (RE) active ions which can
be hosted inside the octapores. Such a preliminary dop-
ing experiment with Nd3+ ions was previously reported
with the aim of investigating RE:LIS potential as a self

recorded with a Fourier-Transform rapid-scan Interfer-
ometer (BRUKER IFS 113V FTIR spectrometer). The
transmission has not been corrected for the Fresnel loss
at the input/output polished facets. Depending on the
growth and annealing conditions, some absorption bands
due to the various point defects - in particular excess sul-
fur ions occupying interstitial sites - may limit the trans-
mission window in the visible side. These visible bands,
responsible of the rose coloration of the annealed sam-
ples, restrict the genuine T
70% transmission range to
0.8
8.1µm. The post-growth thermal treatment, how-
ever, improves considerably the transparency within the
above window. At T
50%, the useful range for cw
≥
applications with L
5 mm is extended from 0.5µm to
8.9µm.
In high power femtosecond parametric ampli-
ﬁcation (as in cw DFG) idler generation almost up to
the zero IR transmission level (12µm) will be reported
in Section X. The absorption coeﬃcient α(λ) within the
full transparency window deduced from the from FTIR
spectra amounts to 0.1 - 0.15 cm−1. These values are
overestimated as we shall see below. To obtain a reli-
able value, the residual loss within the clear transmission
window was also directly measured using various laser
sources on annealed thick samples (L
5mm) and the
derived coeﬃcients α(λ) are confronted to the result of
laser calorimetry measurement of absorptances.

Two rose parallelepipedic optically polished samples
A1 (dimensions 4x5x5 mm3, cut at 66◦ from the a crys-
tallographic axis for propagation in the a
b plane) and
A2 (dimension 5x5x5 mm3, cut at 28◦ from the c crys-
tallographic axis for propagation in the a
c plane) were
used for absorptance measurements. Laser-line measure-
ments were performed using several extended-cavity Al-
GaAs and InGaAsP diode lasers at λ =0.780, 0.843 and
1.265 µm delivering
3 mW of cw power, a cw extended-
cavity InGaAsP diode laser (λ = 1.550 µm) and the
2.53 µm idler output from a periodically-poled LiNbO3
(PPLN) cw OPO [35]. The laser beam was focused to
a small waist of
100 µm in order to scan the sample
aperture area and to avoid some etalon eﬀect arising from
multiple interference when a parallel beam is used (the
samples were slightly tilted from normal incidence). The
direction of polarization of the laser sources were set par-
allel to c or perpendicular (lying in the a
b plane) for
sample A1 and parallel to b or perpendicular (lying in
c plane) for sample A2. The short term (1 s)
the a
power stability of all laser sources was better than
1%.
A sensitive photodiode connected to a trans-impedance
preampliﬁer was used to detect the light. To enhance the
measurement sensitivity, all transmittance was measured
using a diﬀerential technique, by nulling ﬁrst the incom-
ing power using a reference voltage and measuring the
small imbalance voltage once the sample is introduced in

Hence calorimetric absorptance measurements were

where m = 0.438g is the measured mass of sample A2,
P is the laser power, tB the irradiation time, Cth (in
unit of J/kg/K) is the thermal capacity of the sam-
ple and ∆T is the temperature rise of the sample due
to the heat deposited. The absorptance measurements
were performed according to the International Standard
ISO11551 (Test method for absorptance of optical com-
ponents) which deﬁnes the procedures and techniques for
obtaining comparable values for the absorptance of opti-
cal components. In these procedures, the assumption is
made that the absorptance of the test sample is constant
within the temperature ﬂuctuations experienced by the
component during the measurement, constant within the
volume of the component (which was inferred from the
previous transmittance measurement with focused laser
beam) and independent of the power density of the im-
pinging radiation.

The core of the laser calorimeter set-up (Fig. 4), is
made of a thermally isolated camera (TIC) in which

the measured (MS) and a reference sample (RS) were
mounted. The laser radiation passed only through the
tested sample, the reference sample being used to mon-
itor the temperature changes caused by room air tem-
perature ﬂuctuations within the TIC. Both MS and RS
samples were mounted on special holders ensuring a good
thermal contact between the calibrated thermal sensor
(small bead thermistor) and the samples. A linearly po-
larized, diode-pumped Q-switched (1kHz repetition rate,
13ns pulse-width) Nd:YAG laser was focused to a
1mm
spot diameter onto the LIS sample (MS). The average
power was limited to < 1.6 W to avoid possible damage
(pulse energy < 1.6mJ corresponding to an energy den-
0.2 J/cm2 and intensity of 15MW/cm2). To en-
sity of
sure that reﬂected or stray light will not strike the holder
and thermistor, the beam path in front of the RS sample
was apertured with a 1.2mm diameter diaphragm. The
irradiation time was selected in the range between 30s
and 180s according to the requirement of ISO 11551 for
pulsed method. The temperature of the MS thermistor
was digitized by an analog-to-digital converter (A-DC)
and recorded versus time by a computer (PC), for vari-
ous impinging powers.

To use relation (1), the thermal capacity Cth had
to be measured. This quantity is linked to the mo-

is the amount of energy ∆Q required to raise the tem-
perature of one mole of material by ∆T = 1K. By the
time these measurements were performed, no published
data on Cp were available to us hence we had to measure
Cth using a specially built small calorimeter with known
mass and thermal capacity. These latter parameters
were further checked by measuring the well known ther-
mal capacity of a few reference materials (KDP, LiNbO3
and BK7 glass). Such a calibration allowed to estimate
some constants of the calorimeter, such as thermal losses.
Once the mass and thermal capacity of the calorime-
ter accurately determined, the A2 sample was heated to

perature (temperature ﬂuctuation < 0.1K), and inserted

The value of N and the absolute magnitudes of the coef-

as a measure of the degree of lattice anharmonicity, while
the sign of ck is essentially determined by the shape of the
interatomic potential. In Eq. (2), the leading coeﬃcients

than for AgInS2 and AGSe [39], and the resulting Cp(T )

IV. VIBRATIONAL PROPERTIES

The vibrational properties have been investigated by
means of Raman spectroscopy and infrared reﬂectivity in
polarized light at room temperature. The group theory
analysis shows that, at the zone centre for the β-NaFeO2
structure, the 48 normal phonon modes are distributed
among the various irreducible representations of the C9
2v
factor group as follows:

Γvib = 12A1 + 12A2 + 12B1 + 12B2.

(4)

The three acoustic phonon modes have A1, B1 and
B2 symmetries; the 45 remaining (optical) modes are
Raman-active. A1 modes will be active when the experi-
mental conﬁguration selects a diagonal aa, bb or cc com-
ponent of the Raman tensor, while the selection of ba, ca
and cb components will respectively allow the observation
of the optical phonons of A2, B1 and B2 symmetry. A2-
type phonons being infrared inactive, the IR-reﬂectivity
spectra should then contain 11 polar modes of each A1,
B1 and B2 symmetries, with dipole moment respectively
parallel to c, a and b crystallographic axes. In theory,
every optical phonon may then be observed by means
of IR-reﬂectivity and/or Raman-scattering. Nonetheless,
depending on various factors such as the more or less
polar character of bonds, even an active mode may be
unobservable.

×

×

To obtain results on every phonon type, we used two
LIS rose-tinge samples cut from the same ingot, with sizes
5 mm3 and parallel optically polished facets (4x4
4
mm2) normal to a and c axes. Infrared reﬂection spec-
tra were recorded in the spectral range 18.3 - 600 cm−1
with the FTIR interferometer (BRUKER IFS 113V), and
this whole range of data was used to adjust the parame-
ters of the dielectric permittivity model shown in Eq.(5).
The experimental spectra, recorded at quasi-normal in-
cidence (at an angle of incidence of 6◦) with an electric
ﬁeld polarisation parallel to a, b and c axes, are shown in
Fig. 6 (symbols). As can be seen from these graphs, each

reﬂectivity spectrum is rather complex and exhibits sev-
eral more or less overlapping bands, and the high-energy
band(s) in each polarization generally show some addi-
tional structure (slight inﬂexion in the band shape) that
suggests, in addition to a strong mode, the presence of
several other modes contributing to the same band. Ac-
tually, from the numerical analysis of the experimental
results, it is found that for each direction of polarization,
there are three polar modes in the high frequency band
(350 - 420 cm−1) and medium frequency band (250-350
cm−1) and the remaining ﬁve polar modes, not all ob-
servable in Fig. 6, are in the low frequency region (< 250
cm−1).

FIG. 6:
Infrared reﬂection curves (symbols) recorded with
polarized light with an electric ﬁeld parallel to the crystallo-
graphic axes a - B1 modes -, b - B2 modes - and c - A1 modes.
The continuous lines represent in each case the best-ﬁt reﬂec-
tivity curves calculated with the model in Eqs.(5)-(6).

Polarized micro-Raman experiments were performed
using a Jobin-Yvon T64000 Raman spectrometer
equipped with a confocal microscope and a liquid-N2
cooled CCD detector. Raman spectra were recorded at

8

room temperature in the region 12 - 600 cm−1 in triple
substractive conﬁguration with an 1800 gr/mm grating.
To increase the quality and resolution of the spectra, we
chose to use the 647nm red line of an argon-krypton
laser (P=100 mW) which experiences lower absorption
loss than a green laser [40]). To avoid possible inﬂu-
ence of surface defects, the confocal microscope focused
the laser beam at a depth of 60µm under the surface.
A scattering geometry will be described by the notation
e1(p1p2)e2 [41] where ei identiﬁes the propagation direc-
tion of the laser light, polarized along pi, e and p be-
ing a, b or c crystallographic axes; the subscripts i = 1
and 2 refer to incident and scattered beams respectively.
A polarizer and a half-wave plate were used to select
the diﬀerent components of the crystalline Raman ten-
sor b(aa)b, c(bb)c, b(cc)b, c(ba)c, b(ca)b and a(cb)a that
correspond to A1 (the ﬁrst three), A2, B1 and B2 symme-
tries respectively. Fig. 7 shows some of the experimental
spectra. The Raman spectra are dominated by a strong
268 cm−1, also apparent in
mode of A1 symmetry at
the IR reﬂectivity spectra for E//b and E//c.

Due to the respective mass of the atoms, high (low) fre-
quency modes obviously imply movements of Li-S (In-S)
bonds. Phonons of medium frequency (250-350 cm−1),
visible in both IR-reﬂectivity and Raman scattering, are
attributed to In-S bonds [20] while those of highest fre-
quency (above 350 cm−1, Fig. 6) that give rise to strong
IR bands but no observable Raman line are due to weaker
LO splitting observed
Li-S bonds [38]. Polar modes TO
in the infrared measurements for any of the explored po-
larizations is rather important in the high frequency re-
gion (strong IR-bands) which attests for a high polar
(ionicity) character of Li-S bonds in this crystal. The
splitting decreases with the phonon frequency to become
so small for low frequency modes that no corresponding
band appears in the reﬂectivity spectrum which indicates
a mostly covalent character of the In-S bonds. However,
even if a phonon cannot be observed by means of IR-
reﬂectivity, its Raman activity may be high, which is the
case for modes lying below 100 cm−1. Actually intense
Raman lines appear in the low and mid-frequency region,
when almost no line can be detected above roughly 350
cm−1.
In order to ﬁt the experimental IR-reﬂectivity
spectra, and get the best-ﬁt reﬂectivity curves (lines in
Figure 6, in a good agreement with experimental points)
we used the so-called four-parameter model, convenient
to represent even asymmetrical and wide bands [42]. This
model expands the factorized form of the dielectric per-
mittivity function as

LO frequencies deduced from IR-reﬂectivity experiments
are determined to better than 1 cm−1. The precision of a
Raman-active phonon frequency is also generally better
than 1 cm−1, except for broad and low-intensity lines for
which it decreases to 2 cm−1. The transverse or longi-
tudinal character of the Raman-active modes for A1, B1
and B2 symmetries has been determined with the help of
the IR reﬂectivity results where this TO or LO character
is immediate. Non-observed IR-active modes indicate a
small TO
LO splitting and generally did not allow an
accurate determination of TO and LO frequencies from
Raman spectra, but only of a mean value labelled by
TO
LO. A few Raman lines have been attributed to an
interference by an intense line active in another geometry.
Taking into account the diﬀerent conventions adopted by
authors to label crystallographic axes (and modes sym-
metry), these results complement those from previous
studies performed with unpolarized light [20, 38, 43].

≈

≈

The accurate determination of the frequencies in Ta-
ble II allows to estimate the interatomic bonding force
constants in LIS, using the theoretical considerations de-
veloped by Neumann about the correlation between the
vibrational modes of compounds with sphalerite, chal-
copyrite and β-NaFeO2 structures [44]. According to
this model the vibrational spectrum of a crystal with β-
NaFeO2 structure contains two sphalerite-like modes the
TO-frequencies of which are nearly independent on the
polarization direction. Further, one of these sphalerite-
like modes always corresponds to the highest ¯νTO fre-
quency found in the IR reﬂectivity spectra.
If the in-
teraction between the atoms is restricted to next-nearest
neighbors which is justiﬁed by the high bond ionicities
in Li -containing ternary compounds, the wavenumbers
of the transverse optical modes of these sphalerite-like
modes in LiBIIICVI

mass of the cation and mC the mass on the chalcogen
anion (C=S2−). The quantity δαk accounts for the fact
that in the case of IR active modes the local atomic dis-
placements give rise to a non-vanishing net dipole mo-
ment per unit cell and thus, to additional dipole-dipole

where sk is the average bond length (sLi−S = 0.2438
nm, sIn−S = 0.2452 nm), ek = 0.28efk(Zk + ZC) is
an eﬀective charge depending on the bond ionicity fk
and the valences of the cation and anion participating to
the bond. In Ref. [38], from an unpolarized IR reﬂectiv-
ity spectrum of polycrystalline LIS restricted to the re-
gion 200 - 400 cm−1, the highest-frequency TO/LO mode
identiﬁed corresponds to 356/406 cm−1 and the second
TO/LO sphalerite-like mode to 323/334 cm−1. Actually
from the inspection of Table II, the highest-frequency
sphalerite-like modes with nearly identical frequencies in
B1 and B2 symmetries are respectively the 400.4/408.6

A few peaks in each spectrum have been attributed to an
interference of an intense line active in another geometry.

In the β-NaFeO2 structure, the model implies for a given
polarization N damped oscillators, the number N be-
ing at most equal to 11 (number of theoretically observ-
able modes, predicted in this structure by group the-
ory analysis). The j-th damped oscillator represents the
j-th observed infrared active couple of modes, charac-
terized by four adjustable parameters, namely the lon-
gitudinal Ωj,LO and transverse Ωj,TO angular frequen-
cies, and the corresponding damping frequencies γj,LO
and γj,TO. The high-frequency limit values of the di-
electric constant is also adjusted to yield ε∞(A1)=3.99,
ε∞(B1)=4.09, ε∞(B2)=3.97.

cm−1 and 398.6/410.4 cm−1 (this mode is not observed in
A1). The second sphalerite-like mode is recognized from
Table II as the 323.7/333.7 cm−1 (A1), 318.3/334.6 cm−1
(B1), 324.6/329.8 cm−1 (B2), close to the value identiﬁed
in Ref. [38]. The Li-S bond force constant deduced from
Eq.(7) by Sobotta et al [38], αLi = 24.7 N/m, is then
underestimated by (400.4/356)2 = 24% while the In-S
bond force constant, deduced from the second sphalerite-

like mode remains unchanged to αIn = 53.4 N/m. But
even with this slight correction, the Li-S bond remains
still about twice weaker than the In-S bond.
In con-
trast the strength of the Ag-CVI bond in chalcopyrite
compounds is more comparable to that of the BIII-CVI
bonds [38], underlining the speciﬁc nature of the lithium-
chalcogen bond in crystals with tetrahedral coordination
of the atoms. As a consequence, the increased lattice

11

phonon energy of LIS, as compared with AGS or AGSe,
favors heat dissipation, hence a higher thermal conduc-
tivity is expected. Indeed, an unpublished measurement
of LIS thermal conductivity yielded Ka = 6.0 W/(m
K),

Kb = 6.2 W/(m
K) [46], e.g. 5
K) and Kc = 7.6 W/(m
·
·
times larger than for AGS and of the same magnitude as
for LiNbO3.

A last important feature from the vibrational spectra is
that the phonon spectrum for LIS is located at wavenum-
bers below 410 cm−1. The IR wavelength cut-oﬀ (8.1
µm) in Fig. 3 quite exactly corresponds to three times
this highest energy phonon. The long wavelength shape
of the transmission curves - and limit of the transparency
range - seems then to be simply due to multiphonon pro-
cesses. It is worth mentioning that, although the vibra-
tional investigations have used rose tinge samples, the
phonon spectrum should not depend on coloration since
all LIS samples display the same IR cutoﬀ edge, with or
without annealing.

V. THERMAL EXPANSION AND
THERMO-OPTIC COEFFICIENTS

The principal thermal expansion and thermo-optic co-
eﬃcients were determined by using the absolute interfer-
ometric dilatometer and the experimental procedure de-
scribed in Ref. [47]. A two-beam interferometric modiﬁed
Mach-Zehnder arrangement is employed for dilatation
measurements (Fig. 8), while thermo-optic coeﬃcients
are obtained using the same set-up by recording changes
in optical thickness of a sample acting as a thermal scan-
ning Fabry-Perot interferometer, with the natural reﬂec-
tivity of the two opposite parallel facets. Three paral-
8 mm3
lelepipedic shaped samples of dimension 5
cut along the crystallographic axes a, b and c (L = 8 mm)
were used for these measurements. The samples were
subjected to linear temperature ramps of 0.2◦C/min in
the range

20◦C - +100◦C.

VI. PIEZO-ELECTRIC AND ELECTRO-OPTIC
COEFFICIENTS

A. Apparent electro-optic coeﬃcients

The measurement of electro-optic coeﬃcients involves
the determination of changes in optical thickness when
applying an electric ﬁeld to the material. LIS belongs
to the symmetry class mm2 for which the electro-optic
tensor exhibits 5 nonzero components, namely r13, r23,
r33, r42 and r51 [51]. In this subsection we will describe
the electro-optic eﬀect in the principal optic frame where
XY Z are the axes of the index ellipsoid which as we shall
see in the next section coincide with the crystallographic
bac axes. We will address only the ri3’s coeﬃcients that
can be obtained by applying a ﬁeld E3 along the Z-axis
which does not lead to a rotation of the ellipsoid. Opti-
cal interferometric methods may be advantageously used
in this case for their determination. An applied electric
ﬁeld E, with respective components (E1, E2, E3) along
the principal axes (X, Y, Z), will modify the index ellip-
soid according to

expansion behaviour (opposite sign of α along the two
orthogonal directions) that is a major source of thermo-
mechanical stress in high power applications [28]. In con-
trast, LIS expands in the same direction as temperature
increases and exhibits a rather weak temperature depen-
dence. This favorable situation is related to the speciﬁc
nature of the weak Li-S bond already evoked at the end
of Subsection III B.

As evident from Eq.(13), the knowledge on the values
of the thermal expansion is pre-requisite for the inter-
ferometric determination of the thermo-optic coeﬃcients
at a given wavelength. For the orthorhombic symme-
try of LIS it can be seen that each βj may be ob-
tained for two directions of light propagation. This
has been performed at four laser wavelengths chosen in
the transparency window of the material, and the re-
sulting linear ﬁts of experimental data are summarized
in Table III. At λ = 1064 nm and T = 20◦ C, one

technique of Phase-modulated Thermal Scanning Inter-
ferometry (PTSI) [53]. In this method, as for the mea-
surements of thermo-optic coeﬃcients, the sample acts as
a Fabry-Perot thermal scanning interferometer in which
phase modulation is achieved by applying an AC ﬁeld
E3 along the Z axis. The various conﬁgurations of light
polarization (EX , EY , EZ ) and wave vector k (kX , kY )
used to determine the apparent electro-optic coeﬃcients
of LIS are depicted in Fig. 10.

Two of the LIS samples of aperture 5

in Section V with lengths L = 8 mm along the X and
Y propagation axes were supplied with gold evaporated
electrodes on their Z facets. The low frequency (480 Hz)
applied voltage was 200 V peak-to-peak and linear tem-
perature ramps of 0.2◦C/min were used from 20◦C to
55◦C. Measurements of apparent electro-optic coeﬃcients
were performed at 1.064 µm by using a 100mW TEM00
single-frequency Nd:YAG laser. In the scanned tempera-
ture interval a constant value has been observed for each
of them; they are summarized in Table IV. These data
feature a quite weak electro-optic eﬀect in LIS and the
large discrepancy observed between reﬀ

gests a strong contribution of the piezo-electric eﬀect to
the apparent electro-optic one.

From Equation (18) we determine the pure electro-
optic coeﬃcients r13 = 1.0 pm/V, r23 = 0.4 pm/V and
r33 =
1.3 pm/V which reveals a rather small true
electro-optic eﬀect compared to the piezo-electric one.
The relative uncertainty in these values is close to 15%.
These measurements conﬁrm that, as AGS or AGSe,
LIS is a poor candidate for electro-optic or piezo-electric
based devices. A comparison of our results with ear-
lier data of Negran et al [55] cannot be meaningful since
the r13, r23 and r33 that were measured there did not
account for the piezo-electric contribution and were not
determined independently, but as a linear combination.

C. Comparison of the electro-optic and
pyroelectric coeﬃcients

From the anharmonic oscillator model developed by
Garrett [56], Soref [57] yields a semi empirical rela-
tionship between the pyroelectric coeﬃcient at constant
stress σ (p σ =
σ) and the second-order electronic
susceptibility χ(2) describing the linear (true) electro-

The pyroelectric coeﬃcient pσ gives the variation of the
spontaneous polarization ∆Ps induced by a temperature
variation ∆T . The parameters me and e are the mass
and charge of the electron, ωe and ωi are respectively the
electronic and ionic resonance frequencies, Cv is the mo-
lar speciﬁc heat at constant volume (which diﬀers from
the speciﬁc heat at constant pressure Cp measured in Sec-
tion III by a negligible quantity) and NA the Avogadro
number. The constant terms A, B, C and D are the coef-
ﬁcients related to the third order expansion of the crystal
potential energy in the electronic and ionic coordinate
system qe and qi [57]. The ratio (3A + B)/(C + 3D)
indicates the extent to which the predominant ionic con-
tribution to the anharmonic potential at ω
ωi diﬀers
from the predominant electronic one at ω >> ωi. This
ratio is expected to be constant whatever the material,
suggesting a linear relationship between the electro-optic
and pyroelectric coeﬃcients. This hypothesis was veri-
ﬁed for a few known materials, mostly of the oxide type,
as can be seen on Fig. 11 which represents the correlation
between the pyroelectric coeﬃcient and the second order
electro-optic susceptibility.

≈

333 = n4

The plot ﬁguring LIS is obtained by using Cv = Cp as
measured in section III and χ(2)
3r33 from the pre-
vious sub-section. The pyroelectric coeﬃcient was mea-
sured previously [58] as a function of temperature and
10−10 C
its value extrapolated at 300 K is p σ = 6
·
cm−2 K−1. We observe that Soref’s hypothesis is con-
ﬁrmed for the ternary semiconductor LIS, as it was al-
ready shown for the binary one CdS [57]. We note also
that a rather good estimate of the pyroelectric eﬀect may
be deduced from electro-optic measurements and vice
versa, but this requires at ﬁrst an accurate determina-
tion of the piezo-electric contribution.

Boyd et al in 1973 [11] and ﬁtted to one-pole (UV) Sell-
meier equations [59] reproduced also in Refs. [18, 60, 61].
Although the accuracy of their index determination was
not reported, from subsequent nonlinear phase-matched
conversion experiments it appeared that the Sellmeier
equations based on their data are accurate to predict the
birefringence (via angle acceptance bandwith measure-
ments [16]), but fail to predict accurately the absolute
phase-matching directions. Discrepancies of several de-
grees from the expected phase-matching angles were re-
ported [17], especially for wavevector propagation in the
c plane where discrepancies of +6◦ were found for
a
the SHG of 2.55-2.65 µm [40]. Such deviations cannot be
attributed to the X-ray sample orientation uncertainties
0.5◦). Furthermore, we have checked that the phase-
(
±
matching angles, and hence the linear refractive indices,
are independent of crystal coloration or exact stoichiom-
etry.

Following the standard convention for assigning the

(a, b, c), e.g. nX < nY < nZ, one has X

direction will be labelled by (θ, ϕ), where θ is the angle of
the wavevector respective to the polar Z axis and ϕ is the
azimuthal angle between its projection in the X
Y plane
and the X axis. We have used the experimental type-
II (eoe, oeo) SHG angles measured in the fundamental
wavelength range 2.5 - 6 µm [17, 40] to reﬁt the Sellmeier
equations given in Ref. [59]. The SHG data were supple-
mented with new recent data derived from type-II (eoe)
diﬀerence-frequency generation (DFG) of two tunable cw
Ti:sapphire lasers in the X-Y plane (see Subsection X B).
It is therein shown that it is possible to generate mid-IR
wavelength λ1 in the range 5.5 - 11.3 µm by angle-tuning
a 10-mm length yellow-tinge LIS sample cut at (θ, ϕ)
= (90◦, 42◦). To avoid phase-matching angle measure-
ment, the crystal was also studied at normal incidence
while both pump lasers were tuned yielding (λ3, λ2, λ1)

Eqs.(20)-(22) (solid line) and using the Sellmeier equa-
tions of Ref. [59] (dashed line). Let us note the diﬀerent
behavior for λ < 1 µm (absence of a retracing behavior).
Note that although the principal indices on which the
previous dispersion relations are based were measured
from the minimum deviation technique in 1973 [11], the
absorption coeﬃcient of the prism samples used then was
quite diﬀerent (much larger than in Fig. 3 or in Table I
up to about 2.5 µm) which obviously is the reason for
the diﬀerence observed in Fig. 13. Since VZ > 45◦ LIS is
a negative biaxial crystal. At longer wavelengths it can
be regarded as quasi-uniaxial, which is a consequence of
the fact that the two indices nY and nZ are very close.
Therefore no phase-matching can be expected for propa-
gation directions in the vicinity the X-principal axis.

The agreement between the experimental phase-
matching data used to derive Eqs.(20)-(22) and the cal-
culated ones is illustrated in Fig.14 (solid lines) and Ta-
ble V. The accuracy of phase-matching angle prediction
1.5◦. The eight last SHG points in Fig. 14 were
is
discarded from the nonlinear ﬁt for obvious lack of relia-
bility. Only a two-pole form leads to the smallest resid-

ual discrepancies between calculated and experimental
data, while the former one-pole Sellmeier equations [59]
are unable to predict SHG near the cut-oﬀ wavelength of
6 µm. Wavelength non-critical SHG occurs at around
∼
λ = 3.7 µm in the X-Y plane. Due to the small Y-Z
birefringence, type-II (eoo or oeo) SHG in the Y-Z plane
for the experimentally studied branch is restricted as we
shall see in the next section to 2353 < λ < 2675 nm
(with vanishing nonlinearity at this second cut-oﬀ wave-
length), while in the X-Y plane type-II (eoe or oee) SHG
is possible for 2353 < λ < 6111 nm. By comparison, the
DFG phase-matching curves calculated with the previ-
ous one-pole Sellmeier equations are shifted upward by

B. Thermo-optic dispersion relations

The thermo-optic coeﬃcients βj [Eq. (13)] are func-
tions of both temperature T and wavelength λ. From
the determined temperature behavior (subsection V B),
they will be expressed as

β(λ, T ) = a1(λ) + a2(λ) T.

In analogy with the index dispersion equations at room-
temperature (see previous Subsection A) the parameters

These thermo-optic dispersion relations will have to
be reﬁned by experimental temperature phase-matching
data in the future. Relations (25) with the constant
values in Table VI would provide a suitable basis for
such a reﬁt procedure. They predict a FWHM tem-
perature acceptance of ∆T L = 248◦C

length) at room temperature for the type-II (eoe) SHG
of λ = 2.5 µm in the X-Y plane, hence an extremely
low temperature dependence when the three wavelengths
are located in the mid-IR spectral region of constant
dispersion. However for the DFG of near-IR sources
(λ3 = 754.905 nm, λ2 = 850.443 nm, see Table V), the
FWHM temperature acceptance is predicted to be only
∆T L = 46◦C

against self-induced thermal eﬀects. As a counterpart,
its temperature tunability is expected to be somewhat
reduced.

VIII. PHASE-MATCHING INVESTIGATIONS

A. Eﬀective nonlinearity and Hobden classiﬁcation

The phase-matching loci and the eﬀective nonlinear-
ity for LIS will be analyzed in the XYZ-principal op-
tic axis frame, but the tensor elements of the non-
linear susceptibility are deﬁned traditionally, in accor-
dance with ANSI/IEEE Std 176-1987 [54], in the abc-
crystallographic frame where c is the polar two-fold axis
as in Ref. [11]. The chosen convention nX < nY < nZ

in order to have the two optic axes in the X-Z principal
plane aﬀects therefore the expressions for the eﬀective
second order nonlinearity deﬀ.

principal Z-axis. An approach for the generalization of
the deﬀ expressions in the case of collinear interactions

with superscripts ”o” and ”e” denoting the ordinary and
extraordinary beams. LIS behaves as an optically neg-
ative uniaxial crystal in the X-Y and X-Z (for θ < VZ )
planes and as an optically positive uniaxial crystal in the
Y-Z and X-Z (for θ > VZ ) planes. Assuming the Klein-
man symmetry condition to hold then d15 = d31 and
d24 = d32.

The biaxial phase-matching loci for collinear SHG can
be categorized using the classiﬁcation of Hobden [65].
Our calculations based on the relatively simple transcen-
dental equations derived by Yao et al [66], predict that
no phase-matched SHG is possible below 1618 nm. LIS
enters Hobden’s class 13 at 1618 nm, class 11 at 1783
nm, class 10 at 2353 nm, and class 9 at 2675 nm, then
it goes back to class 10 at 5493 nm, to class 11 at 6111
nm, to class 13 at 8224 nm, and ﬁnally no SHG phase-
matching is possible again above 8710 nm. These transi-
tional fundamental wavelengths correspond to propaga-
tion directions along the Y - or along the Z - principal
axes (noncritical phase-matching) either for the ssf or
the f sf (sf f ) polarization conﬁgurations.

Figs. 15a,b illustrate the diﬀerent classes for SHG in
LIS at several representative fundamental wavelengths.
The surface of the unit sphere is projected onto the X-Z
plane of the crystal. The direction of the wave vectors
of the interacting waves for phase-matching as given by
their interception with the surface of the unit sphere is
plotted.

The stereographic projection of the ﬁrst octant is pre-
sented only but the loci in the other octants can be ob-
tained by mirror reﬂections across the principal planes.

We do not present plots of the angle δ which can be
easily calculated from Eq.(30). Its dispersive properties
(determined by the angle VZ ) lead to slightly diﬀerent
values at the three interacting wavelengths but normally
the eﬀect on the conversion eﬃciency can be neglected.
Qualitative arguments relating the spatial walk-oﬀ (mag-
nitude and direction) to the topology depicted in Fig. 15
can be found in Ref. [31]. The calculation of the spatial
walk-oﬀ for an arbitrary propagation direction is beyond
the scope of this paper but several works provide suit-
able approaches to this aim [67, 68, 69, 70]. Analytical
approaches for the estimation of acceptance parameters
based on the small-signal approximation in the general
case of biaxial crystals can be found in Ref. [68, 77].
We note here only, that since the angle VZ for LIS is
not far from 90◦ the dispersive properties and in par-
ticular the spectral acceptance are not expected to be
substantially modiﬁed by propagation outside the prin-
cipal planes. Fig. 15 indicates that double solutions for
the angles exist (e.g.
for Hobden’s class 9) which is
equivalent to the existence of points outside the principal
planes where ∂ϕ/∂θ = 0 holds. This means that noncrit-
ical phase-matching can also occur outside the principal
planes (e.g. at ϕ = 26.7◦, θ = 74.35◦ for ssf type SHG
at 4 µm).

B. SHG in principal planes

planes are shown in the lower part of Fig. 16. The two

It is seen from Fig. 16 that in the Y-Z plane the type-
II interaction is quasi angle-noncritical (but wavelength-
critical, see inset of Fig. 14) which ensures a large accep-
tance angle and a small walk-oﬀ angle. On the opposite,
type-I interaction in the X-Z plane and type-II interac-
tion in the X-Y plane have regions of quasi-wavelength-
0) centered at
noncritical phase-matching (∂Φ/∂λ
3889 nm and 3803 nm, respectively (Fig. 16, see also
Fig. 14). Letting Φ = ϕ or θ, the walk-oﬀ angles in the
upper panels of Fig. 17 are calculated using the simpli-

ﬁed formula tan ρi = [ne
i /∂Φ valid for uniaxial
crystals, where the subscript i = 1, 2, 3 is associated with
wavelength λi (λ−1
2 + λ−1
i (Φ) is the ex-
traordinary index of refraction of the walking-oﬀ wave as
given by the uniaxial analogy in the principal planes. We
preserved its sign which is in accordance with the corre-
sponding phase-matching angles i.e. a positive value of
the walk-oﬀ means that the Poynting vector is at an an-
gle larger than the phase-matching angle and vice-versa.
Note that the walk-oﬀ is very similar for the two branches
of the solution for phase-matching in all three principal
planes.
In the X-Y plane these branches and the two
diﬀerent walk-oﬀ parameters (we have here two extraor-
dinary waves) are almost undistinguishable. The maxi-
mum walk-oﬀ amounts to ρ3 = +1.15◦ in the X-Z plane
for SHG at 3889 nm.

convention nX < nY < nZ the largest birefringence and
consequently the shortest SHG wavelength is obviously
achieved for type-I interaction and propagation along the
Y-axis. However, in LIS when the Y-axis is approached
in the principal planes X-Y or Y-Z deﬀ for type-I inter-
action vanishes and this is true also for the limiting case
of propagation along the Y-axis. This is the reason why
propagation outside the principal planes can be used e.g.
to shorten the SHG lower wavelength limit (Fig. 15). A

parameters ∆31 and ∆32 vanish at 3889 nm in the X-
Z plane which means large spectral acceptance for the
SHG of short pulses where the second derivative of the
wavevector-mismatch comes into play. The situation is
diﬀerent for type-II interaction in the X-Y plane: here
∆32 = -∆31 at 3803 nm, at 2915 nm ∆32 vanishes and
at 4946 nm ∆31 vanishes but in none of these cases an
extremum of the spectral acceptance occurs because in
type-II SHG of short pulses all three waves should be con-
sidered as broad-band. Thus long crystals can be used to
increase the conversion eﬃciency for type-I SHG in the
X-Z plane near 3889 nm even at femtosecond pulse dura-
tions. For type-II SHG of femtosecond pulses near 3803
nm in the X-Y plane the second harmonic will not be
lengthened either because the temporal walk-oﬀ between
the two polarizations of the fundamental wave will limit
the interaction length, but consequently the conversion

ever, only in combination with a control of the spectral
bandwidth through the seed signal. For femtosecond-
laser based frequency metrology applications [74], this
phase-matching when implemented in a synchronously-
pumped OPO would provide a wide frequency comb grid
spanning the 10
12 µm region useful for high precision
spectroscopy of spherical reference standard molecules.
Increasing the phase-matching angle (curve 6 for θ = 45◦
in Fig. 19) the two branches merge into a closed contour
and we approach the point where SHG phase-matching
only for a single wavelength is possible (see Fig. 16) and
all three group velocities are again very close but the
tunability in that case is very limited.

C. Sum-and-diﬀerence frequency mixing

Type-I phase-matching in the X-Z plane for non-
degenerate three-wave interactions (sum- and diﬀerence-
frequency mixing as well as optical parametric genera-
tion, ampliﬁcation and oscillation) is presented in Fig. 19
where two branches of the solution can be seen. The
whole transparency range of LIS can be covered for
0◦ < θ < 40◦ in the X-Z plane but deﬀ increases with
the phase-matching angle θ. Note that deﬀ = 0 in the
noncritical (θ = 0◦) conﬁguration and that the situation
θ > VZ (Eq. 34) is never reached. At larger angles θ we
in
observe a retracing behavior in the left branch: e.g.
the case of OPO, one and the same pump wavelength
λ3 corresponds to two pairs (λ1, λ2) of signal-idler wave-
lengths (curve 5). In this region the spectral acceptance
is very large. Thus for θ = 40◦ (left branch of curve 5),
λ3 = 900 nm and λ2 = 1150 nm all three group veloci-
ties are very close: at the point where ∆31 = 0 we have
∆32 = 23 fs/mm. This means that this phase-matching
conﬁguration is especially suitable for frequency conver-
sion of femtosecond pulses. In the regions near the de-
generacy points (SHG points) we have on the other hand
∆21 = 0 but the wave at λ3 can have in general a diﬀer-
ent group velocity. Such a regime is attractive for broad-
band parametric ampliﬁcation in the ﬁeld of a narrow-
band pump pulse as in the case of chirped pulse opti-
cal parametric ampliﬁcation [73]. In optical parametric
ampliﬁers (OPA’s) this advantage can be utilized, how-

FIG. 20: Type-II (eoe and oee) phase-matching for sum-
and diﬀerence-frequency generation in the X-Y plane of LIS
and several values of the azimuthal angle ϕ : 35◦ (lines 1),
40◦ (lines 2), 50◦ (lines 3), 60◦ (lines 4) and 90◦-noncritical
conﬁguration (thick lines 5). The curves are terminated at
the left and top side by the transparency range of the crystal.

The curves for type-II phase-matching in the X-Y
plane (Fig. 20) have a completely diﬀerent shape. The
two branches of the solution are represented by curves of
opposite curvature which can cross at two points where
phase-matching for degenerate DFG or SHG occurs.
With decreasing phase-matching angle these branches
separate and a single crossing point is reached (see the
curves 3 for ϕ = 50◦) which corresponds to the single
SHG solution in Fig. 16. For yet smaller angles no cross-
ing occurs and the degeneracy point is not reached. For
all phase-matching curves presented we observe again a
retracing behavior at longer λ3:
for each λ3 two cou-
ples (λ1, λ2) are phase-matched. At the point where
these two pairs merge into one (at the maximum λ3 per-
mitting phase-matching) the waves at λ1 and λ2 have
equal group velocities and similarly to the case discussed
for Fig. 19 broadband parametric ampliﬁcation with a
narrow-band pump wave can be realized. The deviation
from the pump group velocity remains, however, essen-
tial. Thus e.g. at ϕ = 90◦ and λ3 = 3310 nm, ∆21 ≃
0
1.65 ps/cm. Improved pump group-
and ∆31 ≃

∆32 ≃ −

matching at this point occurs when decreasing the phase-
matching angle ϕ in accordance with Fig. 16.

Comparing Fig. 20 to Fig. 19 we note that at relatively
short λ3 (e. g. 1064 nm) full tunability with a ﬁxed crys-
tal cut is achievable only in the X-Z principal plane. The
group velocity mismatch depends on the speciﬁc wave-
lengths chosen. At λ3 = 1064 nm (a case interesting for
parametric down-conversion) ∆21(X
Y )
up to λ1 = 10 µm. This means that in this practi-
cal wavelength range type-II phase-matching in the X-
Y plane is more advantageous for the development of
narrow-band parametric generators or oscillators.

Our analysis of the phase-matching properties of LIS is
just a ﬁrst order approximation because it was based on
the small signal limit where saturation is neglected. We
considered also only collinear interactions. Non-collinear
interactions attracted recently great interest because in
addition to the possibility to improve the tunability, to
spatially separate the beams, and to compensate for the
spatial walk-oﬀ, this can considerably reduce the group
velocity mismatch [75]. The latter is very promising for
short pulse interactions. Explicit expressions for non-
collinear phase-matching in the principal planes of a bi-
axial crystal can be found in Ref. [76] and calculations of
non-collinear group velocity matching for arbitrary wave
vector directions in Ref. [77].

SECOND-ORDER NONLINEAR

COEFFICIENTS

There has been only one characterization study of the
nonlinear properties of LIS made by Boyd et al in the
early seventies [11]. The samples used then were of lim-
ited size and poor quality, and besides their results were
derived only from non-phase matched SHG at 10.6 µm
(wedge technique). Further their measurements were
performed relative to the nonlinearity of GaAs, that was
several times corrected during the past years. So it is
important to conﬁrm or to correct these previous re-
sults using phase-matched second-order interactions on
our mature and large enough samples.

The elements dij of the nonlinear tensor (27) have been
determined from the measurement of the SHG eﬃciency
of various laser sources, using either type-I or type-II in-
teractions in the principal planes of LIS and also out of
them. Two kinds of measurements have been performed:
in one kind (Subsection A), the source is the idler output
(in the range 2.4
2.6 µm) of a 12-ns pulsewidth, 10-
Hz repetition rate, type-I LiNbO3-OPO [16]. Long sam-
ples were used and hence the residual absorption and
the beam walkoﬀ eﬀect, as well as the focusing eﬀects,
have to be taken into account to derive the nonlinear
coeﬃcients. The second independent series of SHG ex-
periments (Subsection B) used femtosecond pulses and
very thin oriented samples. This allows to neglect the
eﬀect of absorption and beam walk-oﬀ and focusing ef-
fects, the data analysis in the low-depletion limit being

In order to remain in the low pump depletion limit,
the peak on-axis fundamental intensity used was below 10
MW/cm2, and the maximum idler energy of the LiNbO3-
OPO was 10 mJ at λ = 2590 nm. The spectral linewidth
of the idler was below 15 GHz, and the transverse beam
proﬁle ressembled a Gaussian. Three thick samples of dif-
ferent coloration (rose and yellowish) were used in con-

(ϕ = 66◦, θ = 90◦), but was of yellowish tinge and with
5 mm3 (L = 5 mm). We have checked
dimensions 4
that, as the linear dispersion data, the nonlinear coef-
ﬁcients do not signiﬁcantly depend on coloration when
the additional absorption eﬀect of the yellow samples was
taken into account. For typical pump energy Eω = 1 mJ
and w0 = 1.3 mm, LIS(2) yielded E2ω = 2.5 µJ, while
LIS(1) yielded E2ω = 11 µJ and LIS(3), E2ω = 7 µJ. The
diﬀerence between the eﬃciencies of LIS(1) and LIS(3)
was mainly due to the much stronger second harmonic
absorption of the latter (α2ω = 0.27 cm−1) [40]. For
LIS(1), the residual fundamental and harmonic absorp-

ple, due to OH− band [78]. According to the Gaussian

In the nanosecond regime and for
the given crystal lengths, group-velocity mismatch can
be safely neglected in SHG. The advantage of measuring
the LIS coeﬃcient relative to a reference material stems
from the fact that it is neither necessary to evaluate the
absolute energies nor to take into account the loss due to
the numerous ﬁlter sets used to isolate the fundamental
and second harmonic ﬁeld, since from Eq.(36), the ratio

B. Measurements based on femtosecond SHG

The SHG experiments with femtosecond pulses were
performed also in the low depletion limit for the funda-
mental in order to avoid complications from saturation
eﬀects and spatial eﬀects across the beam cross section.
The coeﬃcient d31 was estimated by type-I SHG in the
X-Z plane from Eq.(33), once it was known it was used
for the determination of d24 from type-II SHG in the X-
Y plane using Eq.(31) and assuming Kleinman symmetry
to hold (i.e. d15 = d31). Finally the diagonal element d33
was measured by type-I SHG outside the principal planes
using Eq.(28) and the already determined oﬀ-diagonal
components of the d(2) -tensor, again assuming Klein-
man symmetry. Note that a similar strategy was used
previously to determine d33 of KTP by phase-matched
SHG [81] and as outlined there the error in the determi-
nation of this diagonal element is normally larger since
it accumulates the uncertainties of the other coeﬃcients.
Alternatively the plane Y-Z could be used for determina-
tion of d24 as done in the previous subsection, however,
the spectral tunability is very narrow in this principal
plane (see Fig. 16) which is not adequate for measure-
ments with broadband femtosecond pulses.

All three LIS samples used here were annealed and rose
5 mm2 and were 0.2 mm
in colour, had an aperture of 4
thick. They were cut at (ϕ = 0◦, θ = 34◦) [LIS(4)],
(ϕ = 59◦, θ = 90◦) [LIS(5)], and (ϕ = 30◦, θ = 44◦)
[LIS(6)], respectively. The small thickness allows to ne-
glect absorption or scattering losses, the focusing eﬀects
and also spatial beam walk-oﬀ eﬀects. This measurement
was also relative and we used as a reference sample an
AGS crystal with the same dimensions cut at ϕ = 45◦
and θ = 45◦ for type-I SHG. In order to minimize the
error originating from the still diﬀerent group-velocity
mismatch the pulsewidth at the fundamental was chosen
relatively large (160 fs in all cases) since LIS samples with
thickness less that 0.2mm could not be prepared with suf-
ﬁcient quality. This pulsewidth corresponds to spectral
bandwidths of 80-90nm. For d36 of AGS we used the
value of 13.9 pm/V [82] which was measured at a sim-
ilar wavelength (λ = 2.53 µm) and actually relative to
d24 of KTP using the same value for the latter as in the

where n3 is the product of the the three refractive indices
involved, and R takes into account the Fresnel reﬂections
at the entrance surface (twice for the fundamental) and
the exit surface (second harmonic).

The femtosecond source at 1-kHz repetition rate was
a KTP-based OPA which was seeded by the frequency-
doubled idler of a BBO-based OPA, both OPAs be-
ing pumped by the same 800 nm, 40 fs pump source
(Ti:sapphire regenerative ampliﬁer). The 3-mm KTP
used in the OPA ensured suﬃciently long wavelengths
that cannot be achieved by BBO. Seeding by the fre-
quency doubled idler of the BBO-OPA was preferred
against seeding by the signal wavelength for two reasons:
the signal wavelengths available from the BBO-OPA were
not short enough to produce idler wavelengths above
2.5 µm with the KTP-OPA, and frequency doubling in
a 2-mm thick BBO crystal of the idler used for seeding
resulted in temporal broadening and spectral narrowing
which was a prerequisite to improve the accuracy. SHG
was performed at 2330 nm with LIS(4), 2850 nm with
LIS(5) and 2300 nm for LIS(6). In all cases more than
5 µJ at the fundamental were available so that it was pos-
sible to reliably measure the SHG with a large area py-
roelectric detector even at low conversion eﬃciency. We
established that up to a conversion eﬃciency of 20% (en-
ergy) into the second harmonic the result did not change.
In the case of LIS(6) the polarization angle δ was adjusted
by a He-Ne laser monitoring the polarization rotation by
the leakage through an analyser till an eigenmode was
reached. No additional improvement of the SHG eﬃ-
ciency could be observed later by further alignment of
this angle which was in good agreement with the calcu-

the optic axis angle VZ (see Eq.(23) and Fig. 13) is rel-
atively small and the deviation between visible (633 nm)

from that eﬀect is estimated to be less than 5%. The fol-
lowing results are values of the d(2) tensor components

The uncertainties are related to the group velocity mis-
match and to the relatively large angular acceptance us-
ing thin samples. The above results are in very good
agreement with the values obtained in the previous sub-
section by a completely diﬀerent strategy and we also
conﬁrmed the diﬀerent sign of the diagonal element d33
as established by Boyd et al [11]. Note that if the re-
sults from Ref. [11] which were obtained by non-phase-
matched SHG are renormalized using a more recent
value of d14(GaAs)=83 pm/V [31] we arrive at d31 =
6.14 pm/V, d32 = 5.31 pm/V and d33 = 9.8 pm/V. Hav-
ing in mind the diﬀerent wavelength (10.6 µm) used in
Ref. [11], we obtain a good agreement within
20% with
the present work for all three nonlinear coeﬃcients.

±

C. Eﬀective nonlinearity of LIS

Once the nonlinear coeﬃcients are determined the ef-
fective nonlinearity deﬀ can be easily calculated in the

principal planes using Eqs. (31)-(33). The main conclu-
sion drawn in Ref. [11], namely that the maximum deﬀ is
achieved in the X-Y plane where it is wavelength (angle)
independent because of the similar magnitude of d24 and
d15, remains valid with our updated values for the dij’s.
However, as already mentioned in subsection VIII B, in-
teresting eﬀects can be expected for propagation out-
side the principal planes. Fig. 21 shows the calculated
deﬀ(ϕ, θ) for SHG using Eq. (28)-(29) with the nonlineari-
ties obtained in the previous subsection and assuming for
simplicity a constant angle VZ = 66◦ between the optic
axes and the Z-principal axis (see Fig. 13) which for the
wavelengths selected leads to only negligible errors. The
fundamental wavelengths indicated in the ﬁgure corre-
spond exactly to the phase-matching stereographic pro-
jections presented in Fig. 15 where the values for the
polar angle θ for the limiting cases ϕ = 0, 90◦ can be
seen. As can be seen from the ﬁgure for type-I SHG in
the Hobden classes 9, 10, and 11 (see subsection VIII A
and Ref. [65]) the improvement in deﬀ when propagat-
ing outside the principal planes is not signiﬁcant. On
the contrary for Hobden class 13, it is deﬁnitely advanta-
geous to use propagation outside the principal planes for
maximum deﬀ in type-I SHG. In type-II SHG the curves
in Fig. 21 have a diﬀerent character and maximum deﬀ is
achieved always in the X-Y plane which is advantageous
as compared to type-II SHG in the Y-Z plane.

For various applications it is important to consider the
down-conversion into the mid-IR of high power sources,
lasers emitting at 1064nm (Fig. 22). For the se-
e.g.
lected wavelengths, the absolute negative extremum of
the type-II curves which occurs in X-Y plane (right end,
with dII
6.5 pm/V) is larger than the ex-

eﬀ(90◦, ϕ)

≃ −

tremum of the type-I curves in the X-Z plane (i.e. on the
left side, with +4 < dI
eﬀ(θ, 0◦) < 5 pm/V). Hence type-II
interaction in the X-Y plane has larger deﬀ than type-I
interaction in the X-Z plane. However, propagation out-
side the principal planes allows to reach a slightly larger
maximum
7.5 pm/V for type-I inter-
action which can be advantageous since other parameters
like e.g. the spectral bandwidth can be better in type-I
interaction. We believe the potential for future applica-
tions of LIS in the mid-IR is related also to the utilization
of propagation schemes outside the principal planes.

X. PARAMETRIC DOWN-CONVERSION IN
LIS

A. Femtosecond optical parametric ampliﬁcation

As outlined in subsection II A LIS possesses the largest
bandgap among all known mid-IR nonlinear crystals
which results in an extremely low two-photon absorp-
tion near 800 nm. This unique feature can be utilized for
the generation of femtosecond pulses in the mid-IR by
down conversion of the most widely spread Ti:sapphire
In
femtosecond laser systems operating near 800 nm.
Ref. [18] initial results were presented in the 4.8
9 µm
region but the gain and the output energy (2 nJ) were
extremely low with a 1.5 mm thick LIS sample used as a
seeded OPA. Here we report an improvement by a factor
of about 50 for the output idler energy and an extension
of the tunability range.

We applied for this experiment a cube of 5

5 mm3
of rose annealed LIS cut at ϕ = 41◦ and θ = 90◦
for type-II interaction in the X-Y plane. The single-
stage travelling-wave-type OPA was pumped by longer
pulses than in Ref. [18] in order to increase the interac-
tion length. We used 300 fs long pump pulses at 820 nm
from a Ti:sapphire regenerative ampliﬁer operating at
1kHz. The pulse lengthening was achieved by adjustment
of the pulse compressor and the pump pulses were not
bandwidth-limited (appr. three times the Fourier limit).
About 30 µJ were used to generate continuum in a 2 mm
thick sapphire plate and 5 diﬀerent interference ﬁlters
between 875 and 975nm were used to select portions (of
about 10nm) of the continuum for seeding the OPA at
the signal wavelength (Fig. 23). The seed pulse duration
was measured by sum-frequency cross-correlation with a
small fraction of the pump pulses in a 0.5 mm thick type-
I BBO crystal and deconvolution yielded a pulse FWHM
of the order of 400 fs (about 3 times above the Fourier
limit). The OPA was pumped by 150 µJ and the pump
beam parameters corresponded to a peak on-axis pump
intensity of 60 GW/cm2.

The mid-IR spectra depicted in Fig. 23 were recorded
with a 0.5 m monochromator (150 gr/mm grating) and
a liquid-N2-cooled HgCdTe detector. Tunability from 5
up to almost 12 µm (i.e. the mid-IR cutoﬀ wavelength
of Fig. 3) could be demonstrated. From 8 to 12 µm an

almost constant energy level exceeding 80 nJ could be
achieved, despite the stronger absorption. This can be
attributed to the lower group velocity mismatch at longer
idler wavelengths [18] and also to the increasing seed
level which eﬀects compensate for the reduced transmis-
sion. The pulse duration of the idler pulses was estimated
from sum-frequency cross-correlation with a 820 nm ref-
erence pulse in a 0.3 mm thick type-I AGS crystal in
which the group mismatch between the two input pulses
ranged from 715 fs/mm at λ1 = 9.5 µm to 800 fs/mm at
λ1 = 6.5 µm. Fig. 24 shows the corresponding cross-
correlation traces. The deconvolved pulse duration at

FIG. 24: Cross-correlation traces at two idler wavelengths
obtained by sum-frequency mixing with a 820 nm, 300 fs ref-
erence pulse. The deconvolved Gaussian pulse durations
(FWHM) are in both cases 575 fs.

7.65 and 9.51 µm (585 fs in both cases) corresponds to
bandwidth-limited Gaussian shaped idler pulses (time
bandwidth product equal to 0.44).

Thus LIS is the only nonlinear crystal that permits
the direct frequency conversion of short pulses from the
5 µm in a sin-
800 nm region to the mid-IR above
gle step extending the region covered by crystals like
LiNbO3, KNbO3 or KTP and its isomorphs [5]. The re-
sults in this section were obtained with ampliﬁed pump
pulses at low (1kHz) repetition rates. Similar single
stage down conversion of high repetition rate (100 MHz)
Ti:sapphire femtosecond oscillators should be possible in
synchronously pumped LIS-based OPOs.

∼

A further potential application of LIS in femtosecond
technology which relies on the extremely low two pho-
ton absorption near 800nm [18] is related to the genera-
tion of single (or sub-) cycle femtosecond pulses (both at
low and high repetition rates) in the mid-IR by DFG
of spectral components belonging to the same broad-
If
band spectrum of an ultrashort 800nm pulse [83].
15 fs long bandwidth-limited pulses centered at 800nm
are used for this purpose the generated mid-IR wave-
length is about 10 µm at which wavelength a 30fs long
pulse would possess only one optical cycle. The basic
limitation in the conversion eﬃciency when using GaSe
as previously demonstrated for this purpose [83] was its
strong two-photon absorption at 800nm.

B. Continuous-wave mid-IR DFG in LIS
(5.5 < λ1 < 11.3 µm)

We report in this subsection the ﬁrst DFG experiments
ever performed with LIS, whose partial results were al-
ready used to derive the accurate Sellmeier equations of
Subsection VII A. Continuous-wave (cw) DFG is most
suited for high-resolution spectroscopy in the mid-IR
range: when both DFG laser sources have linewidths <
1 MHz the mid-IR radiation at λ1 allows to perform sub-
Doppler spectroscopy of heavy atmospheric molecules
with only
1 µW of power. Until now, cw DFG of two
near-IR lasers for the generation of deep mid-IR light ei-
ther used AGS [84, 85, 86] or GaSe [87]. We demonstrate
that LIS is an alternative promising candidate, since we
report cw parametric generation up to 11.3 µm with an
uncoated yellowish LIS sample of dimension 5x5x10 mm3
(L = 10 mm), cut in the X-Y plane for type-II (eoe) DFG
at (θ = 90◦, ϕ = 42◦).

LASER-INDUCED DAMAGE IN LiInS2

A. Photo-induced absorption and gray-tracking

Illumination with various laser sources resulted in the
following photo-induced phenomena observed in LIS,

27

whose magnitude depends on wavelength and pulse du-
ration:

1. Micro-cracking (at λ = 5 µm using femtosecond

pulses from a free-electron laser [17]).

2. Dendrite structure formation (at λ = 1.079 µm us-

ing nanosecond pulses)

3. Photo-induced absorption (PIA) as grey-tracks (at

λ = 0.8 µm using femtosecond pulses).

−

Optical damage of types 1 and 2 is irreversible, while
PIA damage is to a certain extent reversible. It disap-
pears at lower levels spontaneously after several hours
of storage at room temperature or several minutes of il-
lumation with λ > 500 nm. The PIA was detected ﬁrst
in femtosecond OPA experiments with a 1.5mm thick
LIS sample pumped by a 1kHz Ti:sapphire regenerative
ampliﬁer delivering pulses at 800nm with a duration of
200fs and energy of 200 µJ [18]. No surface damage was
observed in these experiments up to a peak on-axis inten-
sity of 140 GW/cm2. In principle as with other materials
optical damage in the femtosecond regime is expected
to occur indirectly as a result of ﬁlamentation and self-
focussing through higher-order nonlinear eﬀects. These
studies permitted to estimate only an upper limit on the
nonlinear absorption losses at 800 nm which were inde-
pendent of polarization and presumably caused by inclu-
sions. They could not be ﬁtted by a TPA process and the
0.04 cm/GW at
estimated upper limit of TPA is βTPA ∼
800 nm [18] which was about 100 times lower than the
βTPA = 3.5
5.6 cm/GW (depending on the polariza-
tion) ﬁtted for a 0.3mm thick AGS crystal under identi-
cal conditions, which is a manifestation of the advantages
of LIS related to its larger bandgap. An updated value
for the upper TPA limit that we derived for a diﬀerent
sample, namely the LIS crystal used in Subsection X A,
is only slightly higher: βTPA = 0.05 cm/GW. Note that
recent TPA measurements on KNbO3 (which belongs to
the same class mm2) at 846 nm using a 5-mm thick sam-
ple phase-matched for cw blue light generation yielded a
TPA magnitude (βTPA = 3.2 cm/GW) of the same order
as that for AGS [89]. In the experiment of Ref. [18] the
gray tracks formation (leading to PIA) was attributed
to non-phase-matched SHG and residual blue light ab-
sorption, i.e. this damage mechanism is only indirectly
related to the high intensity of the femtosecond pulses
that resulted in higher probability for unwanted SHG.
Subsequently diﬀerential absorption (before and after il-
lumination) was measured that had a magnitude reaching
several cm−1 and extended from 400 nm up to the near-
IR (1
2 µm) [90]. Well pronounced maxima of this ab-
sorption were observed at 430 nm and 650 nm. This pho-
tochromic induced-absorption is similar to the so-called
Blue-Induced Infrared Absorption (BLIIRA) observed in
SHG experiments with KNbO3, for which an increased
near-IR absorption coeﬃcient (0.011 to 0.056 cm−1 de-
pending on the sample and corresponding to 2.5 to 9
times the usual linear absorption) at the fundamental

well within the clear transmission range and far from the
TPA region - with the experimental arrangement shown
in Fig. 27. Initial measurements with a 6 W cw focused
Nd:YAG laser beam failed to produce measurable dam-
age, and subsequent measurements were performed with
a pulsed laser. By varying the excitation current, the
pulse energy could be varied between 6 mJ and 25 mJ
at a repetition rate of 10 Hz and a pulse width of about
10 ns. The collimated Gaussian beam with a beam ra-
dius of win = 1.47 mm was focused with a 200 mm focal
length lens to produce a beam waist with a radius of w0=
46 µm. The crystal used was the A1 sample with dimen-
sions 4x5x5 mm3 (θ = 90◦, ϕ = 24◦) already used for lin-
ear absorption measurements (Subsection III A and Ta-
ble I). It was mounted on a xyz translation stage which

wavelength of 860 nm was detected with 100 mW of blue
SH power (30 kW/cm2) generated with a Ti:sapphire
laser [91]. The BLIIRA damage was also reported to be
reversible, after a few hours of relaxation at room tem-
perature, and could be minimized by heating the crystal
or pumping at longer wavelengths [92].

∼

In order to understand the origin of the PIA in LIS,
we proceeded with a direct illumination of LIS samples
at 300 < λ < 450 nm using a 1 kW Xe lamp ﬁltered
through a monochromator for
10 minutes: The same
coloration eﬀect was indeed obtained, with a maximum
eﬀect at 360 nm excitation and vanishing at wavelengths
shorter than 300 nm. Thus the PIA observed in the OPA
experiments is really caused by linear absorption of non-
phase matched blue SHG by point defects present in the
lattice. In line with the photo-induced signal in absorp-
tion spectra (see Fig.3 in Ref. [90]), a complicated system
of lines appears in the Electron Spin Resonance (ESR)
spectrum. Analysis of the angular dependence allowed
us to reveal the superposition of two spectra related to
diﬀerent paramagnetic defects. One of them has a spin
S = 1/2 and an anisotropic g-factor with the following
principal values of the g-tensor: g1 = 2.160, g2 = 2.023,
g3 = 2.023. This spectrum is associated with a cen-
ter of axial symmetry with g1, directed along the In-S
bond and is related to sulfur S− ion in a regular site.
The second spectrum comprising a broad enough line at
3300 Gauss (g = 2.0024) is associated with Li0.
H
∼
The interpretation of these results is the following. At
short-wavelength excitation (λ < 450 nm) the following
recharge process occurs in LIS:

S2− + Li+

S− + Li0.

(47)

→
Such excitation produces free charge carriers which are
captured in some deep traps and can be released at
λ > 500 nm illumination. We established that the gray
track formation is maximized for excitation near 360 nm
but dropped by one order of magnitude at 420 nm, which
means that in OPO/OPA experiments it can be reduced
by using slightly longer pump wavelength λ3. Note that
the same process also takes place at x-ray irradiation,
which is used for crystal orientation when fabricating op-
tical elements: some darkening occurs sometimes in the
bulk sample during this operation. The PIA magnitude
was found to be dependent on the LIS composition [93]:
The eﬀect is minimum in the case of nearly stoichiomet-
ric composition. The PIA was also found to be much
more pronounced in LIS than in LISe. A detailed analy-
sis of thermo-luminescence in LIS, ESR studies and the
role of point defects in the PIA phenomenon will be given
elsewhere.

B. Optical damage threshold measurements at
1064 nm

Systematic optical damage threshold measurements
were performed with Nd:YAG lasers at 1064 nm - i.e.

FIG. 28: Damage threshold, expressed as ﬂuence, versus
beam radius at the crystal surface.

could be moved along the laser beam over a distance
extending from the lens to the focus location. The corre-
sponding ﬂuences ranged from 0.19 J/cm2 to 752 J/cm2,
and by using diﬀerent pulse energies, the same ﬂuence
could be sustained over a range of spot radii. The Gaus-
sian character of the beam was veriﬁed, and the beam
radius measured by the knife-edge technique.

The onset of radiation damage was determined from
the observed sudden drop in the transmitted signal as
shown in Fig. 27. At each experimental point (z-value),
the crystal was inspected visually in a low-power micro-
scope, and the drop in transmission was found to cor-
relate with the onset of visible damage at the surface.
By performing experiments with diﬀerent pulse energies
it was found that the damage threshold, expressed in
J/cm2, tends to decrease with increasing spot size as seen
in Fig. 28. Although the amount of data is too limited to
warrant a detailed analysis, it suggests a levelling oﬀ at
about 1 J/cm2 at large spot sizes (e.g. a peak intensity
threshold of 100 MW/cm2), and this value agrees well
with the value 1.1 J/cm2 reported by Knippels et al. at
a wavelength of 5 µm [17]. The observed dependence in
Fig. 28 is understandable in view of the fact that as the
spot size increases, it becomes increasingly diﬃcult for
heat generated at the centre to diﬀuse to the unexposed
regions of the crystal.

The visual appearance of the damage is illustrated in
Fig. 29, where the z-scan sequence shown in the lower
part of Fig. 27 corresponds to the uppermost spot of the
picture.
In Fig. 27, the initial increase of transmitted
energy reﬂects the fact that the center of the beam is too
close to the edge to allow the entire beam to be inter-
cepted by the crystal when the beam radius is largest. In
some cases damage was found to extend into the interior
of the crystal, as seen at the lower spot in Fig. 29.

These damage properties should be discussed in com-
parison with available damage data on AGS or AGSe.
For AGS under cw pumping the onset of thermal lensing
11 kW/cm2 from a
has been previously evaluated at
cw AGS doubly resonant OPO containing
3 W of cir-
culating power at 1.26 and 2.52 µm focused to a waist
of w0 = 90 µm [8, 9]. The cw damage threshold value
is actually unknown, but is estimated to occur in the
40 kW/cm2 [36], despite a report that 3.5
range
W of cw Nd:YAG radiation focused to a waist of 20 µm
(280 kW/cm2) did not damage an AGS sample [94]. For
AGSe, the measured damage threshold at 9 µm (cw CO2
22 kW/cm2 [95], corrobo-
laser) was ascertained to be 5
rating that chalcopyrites display extremely low cw dam-
age threshold. The fact that at 6W -pumping at 1064 nm,
focused down to w0 = 40 µm no visible damage was ob-
served in the LIS sample sets the cw damage threshold to
a lower limit of > 120 kW/cm2. The 5 times larger ther-
mal conductivity of LIS as compared to AGS certainly
favors the use of LIS in intra-cavity cw applications.
Under similar nanosecond pulsed regime, however, the
1 J/cm2 damage threshold measured with LIS is com-
∼
parable to the threshold found for AGS or AGSe [96, 97].

−

FIG. 29: Photograph of the A1 sample from Subsection III A
showing the visible appearance of radiation damage spots. We
emphasize the bulk feature of the damage on the lowest spot.

Independent measurements under identical experimen-
tal conditions at longer wavelengths (9.55 µm) with 30 ns
long pulses yielded damage thresholds of 6.5 J/cm2 for
LIS [60] and 5.5 J/cm2 and 4.2 J/cm2 for AGS and AGSe,
respectively [98].

From these preliminary damage threshold investiga-
tions, it is premature to assess whether the damage mech-
anisms are due to native point defects or are intrinsic to
the compound. Considering the current state-of-the-art
of residual absorption on this compound, one may ex-
pect that with an improvement in residual transparency
and a better control of the growth parameters toward the
production of stoichiometric material, the above damage
threshold values can be improved.

XII.

IS LIS RELATED TO FERRO-ELECTRICS?

In contrast with the chalcopyrites, LIS and LISe are
pyroelectric as the orthorhombic symmetry oxides (KTP
isotypes) belonging to the same mm2 point group. The
spontaneous polarization is due to the fact that in each
bipyramid formed by two adjacent tetrapores (Fig. 2)
only one is occupied by a Li+ cation. The other one is
empty, which corresponds to a negative eﬀective charge.
An intriguing issue, which has not still received a def-

inite answer, is whether such Li-chalcogenides can be
related to ferroelectric materials, i.e.
if it is possible
to invert their spontaneous polarization along the po-

lar c-axis.
cluded that LIS and LISe do not display a para-to-
ferroelectric phase transition from the absence of a sud-
den anomalous rise in the record of the pyro-electric
current versus temperature. This is not surprising be-
cause of the screening eﬀect of the high ionic conduc-
tivity of Li. They measured a pyroelectric coeﬃcient
pσ(300K) = 2.6
K). A more recent and
·
reliable measurement of the pyro-electric coeﬃcient per-
formed with our rose samples yielded a 2.3 times higher
value pσ(300K) = 6.0
K) [58], which is
·
5 times smaller than the value for KTP [99]. In contrast
with Negran et al ’s report, a strong increase of the pyro-
current slightly above room-temperature, preceded by a
sharp current spike, was noticed but this increase was
attributed to space charge relaxation of the thermally-
activated Li+ cations [58].

The issue about whether Li-chalcogenides are (or are
not) related to ferroelectrics is of upmost importance,
considering their deep mid-IR transparency which would
allow to fabricate quasi-phase matched periodically-poled
5 µm, which
structures for wavelengths longer than
is the current limitation of oxide-based ferroelectrics such
as LiNbO3 or KNbO3. The measurement of the Curie
temperature (a temperature at which the material tends
to loose its spontaneous polarization), the study of its
dielectric conductivity versus an applied ac electric ﬁeld
in order to reveal a dielectric hysteresis loop (and the
value of the coercive ﬁeld) have to be performed to answer
to the question. Future investigations will be aimed at
this issue.

Nevertheless, we have attempted to invert the sponta-
neous polarization by use of an external electric ﬁeld. We
tried to invert domains in 0.5 mm thick c-cut LIS plates
by using standard methods developed for the fabrica-
tion of PPLN for quasi-phase-matching [100]. A periodic
structure of photoresist with a periodicity of Λ = 30 µm
was lithographically formed on the +c surface of the crys-
tal. Silicon O-rings with a diameter of 4 mm on each
surface ﬁxed the crystal between two acrylic glass plates.

FIG. 30: Experimental setup for periodic domain inversion.

30

A solution of LiCl in water was used to establish the elec-
trical contact between the power-supply and the crystal
(see Fig. 30). An electrical resistor in the circuit limited
the current. An oscilloscope measured the voltage and
the current.

Because the coercive ﬁeld - if any - is unknown, rect-
angular pulses of diﬀerent voltages from 200 V to 6.4 kV
were applied to the crystal using a resistor of 1 GΩ. Even
at the lowest voltage a current was measured. At a volt-
age of 1 kV the current was 0.52 µA. The dependence
of the voltage on the current was linear and the current
did not terminate after a time when the whole crystal
should be domain-inverted. This implies that the mea-
sured current does not result from domain switching but
from ionic conductivity of the Li+ ions, conﬁrming the
results of the pyro-electric coeﬃcient measurements [58].
From our measurements we estimate a value for the con-
10−10 Ω−1cm−1. Etching of the
ductivity of σZ = 4.3
crystal in a mixture of ethanol and HNO3 did not reveal
any periodic domain structure on the crystal surface. So
far, we were not able to obtain inverted domains.

×

In parallel to the afore-mentioned ferroelectricity stud-
ies, we plan in the future to perform ab initio low-
temperature-poling of LIS, a method which was devel-
oped for periodic domain reversal in KTP, which also
exhibits a high ionic conductivity of the K+ ion at room
temperature [101]. Cooling the crystal down to temper-
atures of 170 K reduces the conductivity in KTP by a
factor of 105. This possibly could work for LIS as well.
Further, the conductivity is expected to be lower in fu-
ture crystals with a composition close to stoichiometry.
In the case of LiNbO3 or LiTaO3, the coercive ﬁeld is
much lower for stoichiometric crystals as compared with
congruent material [102, 103].
If similar eﬀects would
occur in LIS, this would be an additional advantage.

Given the varying stoichiometry of the LIS samples
currently produced [15], the presence of points defects
and the high ionic conductivity due to Li ions, the fail-
ure of the poling attempts is not quite surprising. It is
still premature to conclude on the ferroelectricity issue,
and further systematic investigations for a para-electric
to ferro-electric phase transition are still required.

XIII. CONCLUSIONS

We have characterized the main physical properties
of the newly emerging lithium thio-indate chalcogenide
semi-conductor that are relevant for nonlinear applica-
tions from the visible down to the deep mid-IR. Table VII
summarizes these properties, as well as those determined
in previous works. LiInS2 or LIS can now be considered
as a mature compound and its future widespread use in
nonlinear devices should reﬁne all the data collected from
this investigation campaign.

Among its most relevant advantages over the existing
mid-IR crystals, one may quote its excellent thermal sta-
bility and high damage threshold suitable for high power

laser applications and its extremely extended phase-
matching capabilities (over its whole transparency range)
using either type-I or type-II interactions in or out-of
principal planes. Such an extended phase-matching ca-
pability is still compatible with low birefringence walkoﬀ
angles. LIS is the only existing material for direct down-
conversion from the near-IR to the deep mid-IR up to
12 µm, owing to its highest bandgap energy.
Its high
eﬀective nonlinearity of
7 pm/V (slightly lower than
that of the chalcopyrite crystals) is substantially higher
than that of the oxides of the KTP family and is almost
constant for type-II interaction in the azimuthal principal
plane. We have shown that LIS should be very promising
for the frequency down-conversion of femtosecond laser

∼

sources. We have also enlightened its favorable properties
as a crystal host either for laser action up to λ = 6 µm
using active rare-earth ion doping, or for self down-
conversion medium provided that the doping process dur-
ing growth is mastered, in order to obtain high qual-
ity optical elements. We are also conﬁdent to bring its
residual absorption to a level comparable to that of AGS
or AGSe, by reﬁning the Bridgman-Sockbarger growth
technique and post-growth treatments. At equivalent
loss level, LIS would be less subject to thermal lensing
than AGS [8, 9] permitting its use in cw OPOs for deep
mid-IR generation. The next challenge and eﬀort will
be directed to the detailed studies on its eventual ferro-
electric properties. Also, we started to investigate other

Li-containing compounds such as LiInSe2 (LISe), LiGaS2
(LGS), LiGaSe2 (LGSe), LiGaTe2 (LGTe) [22, 104].

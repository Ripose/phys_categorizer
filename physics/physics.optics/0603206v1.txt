The basic assumption of the authors of manuscript arXiv:physics/0603175v1
21 Mar 2006 is that a laser wave diﬀers from a plane wave because of photon
coherence. This is not true and therefore their conclusion is also wrong.

The authors claim that a laser wave is a coherent state of photons with
momentum k and polarization λ, while a plane wave is not. Actually, a plane
wave is a coherent state which coherence length lc is inﬁnite, where lc = c/∆ν, c
being the light velocity and ∆ν the spectral width of the wave packet. Obviously
∆ν is zero for a plane wave.

Thus the κ(1)(ω) of equation 10 does not represent the absorption rate for a
plane wave but simply the absorption rate for a single incident photon. There-
fore equation 10 simply states that the total absorption rate is proportional to
the number of photons, which is trivial. The enhancement of the absorption
rate of a laser beam compared to that of a single photon has thus nothing to
do with quantum coherence. The same announcement can be made for a plane
wave having the same mean number of photons.

Moreover, the authors claim that their calculations may explain for instance
the results of the PVLAS collaboration (See ref. [2] of the original manuscript),
but they do not explain how they ﬁgured it out. Let us make the calcula-
tion: according to the authors, the ellipticity and apparent dichroism should be
enhanced by a factor

¯N ≃ ǫ0E2
¯hω
where E ∼ 1 kV/m corresponds to a power of 100 mW, ¯hω ∼ 2 × 10−19 J
corresponds to a wavelength of 1.06 µm, S ∼ 10−6 m2 the waist of the beam
and lc = c/∆ν ∼ 106 m of the coherence length of the cavity.

Slc,

As a result, the enhancement factor should be at least on the order of ¯N ∼

1013, i.e. 9 orders of magnitude larger than what was indeed observed!

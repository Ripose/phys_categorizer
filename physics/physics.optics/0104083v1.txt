Abstract

A method is presented to investigate diﬀraction of an electromagnetic plane

wave by an inﬁnitely thin inﬁnitely conducting circular cylinder with longi-

tudinal slots.

It is based on the use of the combined boundary conditions

method that consists on expressing the continuity of the tangential compo-

nents of both the electric and the magnetic ﬁelds in a single equation. This

method proves to be very eﬃcient for this kind of problems and leads to fast

numerical codes.

I. INTRODUCTION

The problem of the penetration of electromagnetic waves in a conducting circular cavity
through a narrow axial aperture has been treated by several authors. Several methods have
been used to achieve the determination of the ﬁeld inside the cavity. Beren [1] used the
Aperture Field Integral Equation , the Electric Field Integral Equation and H-ﬁeld Integral
Equation to determine the ﬁeld around an axially slotted cylinder, while Johnson and Zi-
olkowski [2] gave a generalized dual series solution for this problem. Mautz and Harrington
treated the ﬁeld penetration inside a conducting circular cylinder through a narrow slot in
both TE [3] and TM [4] polarizations. More recently Shumpert and Butler [5], [6] proposed
three methods to study the penetration in conducting cylinders. In this article, we propose
a method to calculate the ﬁeld inside and around a slotted circular cavity with longitudinal
slots. It is based on the combined boundary conditions method introduced ﬁrst by Montiel
and Nevi`ere [7,8]. Section II is dedicated to the description of the theory. In section III we

give some details about the numerical scheme and then compare our results with previous
work.

II. THEORY

The structure under study is depicted in Fig 1. The space is divided into two regions, region 1
(exterior region : r > R) and region 2 (interior : r < R) that are assumed to be dielectric and
homogeneous with relative dielectric permittivities ε1 and ε2, respectively. On the interface
between these two media are deposited a ﬁnite number of inﬁnitely conducting, inﬁnitely
thin circular strips that are invariant along the z direction. The device is illuminated by
a TMz (electric ﬁeld parallel to the z axis) or TEz (magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the z axis)
monochromatic electromagnetic wave under incidence θ0 with vacuum wavelength λ.
iωt) time dependence. The z component of the
Throughout this paper we assume an exp (
electric or the magnetic ﬁeld will be denoted by u (θ, r) . We denote by Ω1 the union of the
strips and by Ω2 its complementary in [0, 2π] .
In the exterior region we express the total ﬁeld as :

−

u1 (θ, r) =

anJn(k1r) exp(inθ)+

bnH (1)

n (k1r) exp(inθ)

n∈Z
X

n∈Z
X

Likewise in the interior region the total ﬁeld may be expressed as :

u2 (θ, r) =

cnJn(k2r) exp(inθ)

n∈Z
X

where an, bn and cn are the amplitudes of the incident, the diﬀracted and the transmitted
waves respectively. We denote Jn and H (1)

kind. kp = k0√εp =
λ
Amplitudes an being known, the problem is to determine amplitudes bn and cn from which
the total ﬁeld can be calculated everywhere. For that purpose one must write the bound-
ary conditions at the interface between both dielectric media. This is done in the next
subsections by distinguishing the TMz and the TEz cases of polarization.

The boundary conditions applied to the tangential components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
at the interface deﬁned by r = R lead to :

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

−

The inﬁnite linear systems (10) and (17) are truncated to a ﬁnite size by retaining only
(2N + 1) coeﬃcients and solved to obtain a representation of the ﬁeld at truncation order
N. The convergence of the results has been checked by increasing integer N and using the
usual criteria of energy balance ( optical theorem ) and reciprocity. We have also veriﬁed
that the boundary conditions are fulﬁlled, for instance the nullity of the tangential electric
10−3. However,
ﬁeld on the strips. In all the calculations carried in this paper we set g =
as mentioned in [9], numerical experiments show that only the sign of g is of importance: the
numerical scheme is more stable with a negative value of g. All the computations reported
have been obtained on a Personal Computer (200 MHz processor with 32 Mo of RAM), only
a few seconds are necessary to perform each result shown here.
In the following we provide some numerical examples and compare our results with those
obtained in previous works [3], [4], [5] and [6].
In our ﬁrst example, we consider a circular cavity with a single longitudinal narrow slot
(see Fig. 2) with φ = 5◦ and we compute the interior ﬁeld on x axis. Figures 3 (a) and (b)
show the magnitude of the normalized electric ﬁeld in both the TMz and the TEz cases of
polarization. It can be seen that our results are in excellent agreement with those published
recently by Shumpert and Butler [5], [6], see for instance ﬁgure 6 in this last reference. In the
second example, we consider a circular cavity with an aperture such that φ = 5◦. In ﬁgures
4 (a) and (b) are plotted the normalized electric ﬁeld amplitude at the center of the cylinder
for various values of the parameter k1R for both the TMz and the TEz cases of polarization.
These curves agree with those obtained by Mautz and Harrington (see references [10] and
[11] ). It is worth noticing that the resonances in these plots correspond to the modes of the
cavity.
Finally we give the map of the electric ﬁeld around and inside the slotted cylinder when
excited by a plane wave such that k1R corresponds to a mode of the closed cylinder. We
can see in ﬁgures 5 (a) and (b) that the modes TM01(k1R = 2.404) and TM11(k1R = 3.832)
are excited inside the structure.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have developed a very eﬃcient and fast method adapted to study diﬀraction of an elec-
tromagnetic wave by a ﬁnite number of inﬁnitely thin, inﬁnitely conducting strips deposited
It is based on the combined boundary conditions method. The
on a dielectric cylinder.
method is very low CPU-time consuming. The numerical examples that have been given to
illustrate the method are not restrictive. One can use as an incident radiation a beam of any
shape. It suﬃces to calculate its corresponding incident amplitudes an. It is also possible
to study the radiation pattern of a source located at the center of the cylinder by making
slight changes in the equations.

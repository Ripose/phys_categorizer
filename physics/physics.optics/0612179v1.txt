Abstract. We propose to use a multimode optical ﬁber with a D-shaped cross
section as a privileged system to image wavefunctions of a chaotic system. Scar
modes are in particular the subject of our investigations. We study their imprints
on the statistics of intensity and we show how the introduction of a localized gain
region in the ﬁber is used to perform a selective excitation of scar modes.

1 Introduction

Experimental wave chaos has naturally emerged from the will to achieve simple experiments
to study quantum chaos. Since 1980, a lot of experiments have been performed in diﬀerent
systems and with diﬀerent natures of waves. Some years ago, as we were interested in the
study of the spatial properties of waves that propagate in a chaotic medium, we asked the
following question: how to image wave chaos experimentally? In the litterature, some nice way
to vizualize the wavefunctions of chaotic billiards have already been proposed. An exhaustive
presentation of wave chaos experiments is reported in the St¨ockmann’s book[1], we brieﬂy cite
the main experiments related to wave chaos imaging. Spatial distributions of intensity have
ﬁrst been observed in microwave stadium cavities by Stein and St¨ockmann[2] showing a selec-
tion of wavefunctions associated with some particular periodic orbits. By measuring the ﬁeld
displacement of vibrating plates, Schaadt et al.[3] have investigated the statistical properties of
the wavefunctions of a Sina¨ı stadium plate. In the afore mentioned studies, the measurements
were nondirect: the mapping of the wavefunctions was obtained by performing a point-to-point
scan of the surface (of the microwave cavity, or of the aluminium plates).
A direct visualisation of the wave patterns of a stadium has been achieved on the surface of
water enclosed in a stadium-shaped container by Bl¨umel et al.[4]. This type of experiment
prevents any quantitative analysis of the statistical properties of the ﬁeld, but has produced
interesting results on the direct observation of scarred patterns[5].
Optical waves also constitute an evident candidate to image wave chaos. One of the ﬁrst exper-
iment with optical waves invoking the properties of classical chaos to explain the behavior of
waves has been proposed by the group of A. D. Stone[6]. It has been shown that the lasing prop-
erties of deformed droplets can be understood via a transition to chaotic ray dynamics. Until
2002, no direct observation of the wavefunctions of a chaotic optical billiard had been realized.
With the aim of studying the spatial properties of waves in a chaotic system, we have then pro-
posed an experiment of wave chaos in an optical ﬁber. The experiment, simple in its concept,
oﬀers a direct access to the spatial distribution of intensity by imaging the near-ﬁeld intensity
at the ﬁber output. Unlike previous experiments, this experiment also gives the opportunity
to investigate the properties of a ﬁeld being the result of the propagation of a superposition
of several modes. In this paper, we propose an overview of our recent results on the spatial
properties of the wavefunctions of a chaotic multimode optical ﬁber. From the experimental
validation of Berry’s conjecture on the generic ergodic behavior of wavefunctions of a chaotic
billiard to the direct observation of a scar mode, optical ﬁbers provide a good experimental

system to image wave chaos.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the experimental setup is described and its
relevance in the ﬁeld of wave chaos is presented. Our main results about the experimental ob-
servation of the typical behavior of wavefunctions in a chaotic billiard are reported in section
2.2. In order to investigate the scar wavefunctions, we have developped two approaches: the
ﬁrst one is dedicated to the signature of a scar wavefunction on the statistics of the ﬁeld and
intensity, the other one to a selective excitation of scar by the way of optical ampliﬁcation.
Theses recent studies are described in section 3.

2 Presentation of the experimental system

2.1 Description of the system

The multimode optical ﬁber designed and fabricated in our lab for our studies is brieﬂy described
in this section. The transverse cross section of the ﬁber is a truncated disk fabricated from a
1-cm-diameter preform of silica that has been cut at half its radius and pulled at a temperature
low enough to maintain the D-shaped cross section. The ﬁnal dimensions of the ﬁber after
pulling are 120 µm for the diameter and 90 µm for the truncated diameter (see ﬁg. 1). These
dimensions diﬀer from the typical 10-µm-diameter of a single mode optical ﬁber used in the
ﬁeld of optical telecommunication. The index of refraction of the silica core nco at our working
wavelength is around 1.458. It is surrounded by a black silicon cladding with an index of
refraction equal to nclad=1.453. The cladding is tinted in order to prevent light from being
guided during the propagation.

As the characteristic dimensions of the ﬁber are large compared to the optical wavelength, a
collimated light beam that propagates along the ﬁber can be approximated, in the geometrical
limit, to a ray that reﬂects on the core/cladding interface along the propagation in the ﬁber. A
formal derivation of the eikonal equation from the 3D Helmholtz equation is given in [7] and
justiﬁes the analogy of our system with a chaotic billiard. Indeed, the evolution of a ray along
the ﬁber (in the direction of z) can be associated to a time evolution on the transverse cross
section of the ﬁber (see ﬁg. 2).
The so-called D-shaped billiard, as soon as the truncated diameter Dt is larger than half the
radius, has been proved to be a fully chaotic billiard by Bunimovich[8] and Ree[9]. If the optical
ﬁber can be seen as a wave billiard, it also constitutes an interesting analogous quantum system.
Indeed, the propagation of the ﬁeld along the ﬁber is described by the Helmholtz equation. In
the weak guidance regime, i.e. for a small diﬀerence of indices between the core and the cladding
[(nco−nclad)/nclad ≪ 1], a given polarization is nearly perfectly preserved along the propagation
thus enabling to use the scalar form of the Helmholtz equation:

with k0 the vacuum wavenumber and n(r) the index of refraction in the medium. In the paraxial
approximation, this equation reduces to the following form:

∆ + V (r)]φ(r, z)

iβco∂zφ(r, z) = [−

2
where βco = ncok0 and φ(r, z) is deduced from ψ(r, z) = φ(r, z)eiβcoz. The paraxial approxi-
mation is associated to the propagation of light close to the optical axis and is fulﬁlled as soon
as the angle of the guided ray is much smaller than the cutoﬀ angle θmax which is given by
sin θmax = p1 − (nclad/nco)2.
Equation 2 is then formally equivalent to a pseudo-time independent Schr¨odinger equation. As
a consequence, the D-shaped ﬁber appears to be an ideal wave chaos paradigm of a quantum
chaos experiment.

2.2 Typical results

One advantage of the experiment with the optical ﬁber is that the experimental setup is con-
ceptually simple. A beam from a Helium-Neon laser source at λHe/N e = 628nm is collimated
and enlarged so that its size becomes large enough compared to the transverse size of the ﬁber
to be in a quasi-plane wave illumination. The main parameter of the experiment is then the
angle θ between the beam with the optical axis at the ﬁber entrance. Indeed, this angle gov-
erns the value of the transverse wave number in the ﬁber κt by the way of the simple relation
κt = k0ncosinθ and, as a consequence, the modes that will be excited and guided in the ﬁber.
At the output of the ﬁber, one can image either the near-ﬁeld (NF) intensity using a microscope
objective or the far-ﬁeld (FF) intensity in the focal plane of a suitable lens. Typical observa-
tions associated to a value of the transverse wave number κt = 36/R are presented in ﬁgure
3. As diﬀraction occurs due to the ﬁnite aperture of the ﬁber, several transverse wavenumbers
around the main transverse wavenumber κt contribute so that more than one hundred modes
are superposed at the output of the ﬁber. The NF ﬁgure 3(a) shows a speckle pattern: the
intensity is statistically uniformly distributed over the whole cross section of the ﬁber. This
ﬁgure is associated to the superposition of several modes each with a speckle-like behavior as
predicted by M. V. Berry[10]. A nice experimental evidence of Berry’s conjecture is given by
the FF intensity ﬁgure 3(b). In this ﬁgure, the intensity tends to ﬁll a ring, whose mean radius
is centered on the input transverse wavenumber κt and its width is determined by the number
of contributing modes. This illustrates that the ﬁeld is constituted by the random superposition
of a great number of plane waves each with a ﬁxed transverse wave number but with random
directions: the ﬁeld of this generic so-called speckle mode can then be seen as a real Gaussian
random variable.
The ﬁeld that propagates along the ﬁber can be decomposed on the eigenmodes’ basis {φn}:

ψ(r, z) = X
n

cnφn(r)eiβnz

(3)

where cn is the coupling coeﬃcient between the input ﬁeld ψ0(r) and the eigenmode φn, and
βn is the propagation constant of the mode φn (β being deﬁned as β2 = β2
t ). In the

paraxial approximation, κt ≪ βco, and the exact expression of the decomposition of the ﬁeld
on the eigenmode’s basis is: ψ(r, z) = Pn cnφn(r) exp(i(βco − κ2
Assuming that the ﬁeld of each mode can be seen as a random gaussian variable, one can
easily deduce that the distribution of intensity of one mode I = |φ|2 follows a Porter-Thomas
distribution. By superposing several modes, a Poisson distribution for the intensity of the ﬁeld
ψ(r, z) is then expected[11]. The ﬁgure 4 represents the probability distribution of intensity
for the superposition of modes of the ﬁgure 3 and shows a good agreement with the Poisson
prediction.

We have experimentally investigated the series of scar modes associated to the shortest unstable
periodic orbit that is the 2-bounce periodic orbit along the axis of symetry of the ﬁber’s cross
section. One can expect to observe a constructive interference eﬀect building upon this periodic
orbit if the following quantization condition for the value of the transverse wavenumber is
fulﬁlled:

where L is the length of the periodic orbit, p an integer, π/2 is a phaseshift due to the existence
of a self focal point on the 2-bounce periodic orbit, and ∆ϕ is the phaseshift due to reﬂection
at the core/cladding interface. In the optical context, scar modes along the 2-bounce periodic
orbit (PO) can be described as the modes of an unstable dielectric Fabry-Perot cavity.

By solving the eq. 4, one obtains quantized values of the transverse wavenumber associated
to scar eigenmodes along the 2-bounce PO. For very precise illumination conditions, we have

successfully excited a few modes around the scar mode of order p = 5. The NF and FF intensity
observed at the output of the ﬁber are presented in ﬁgure 5.
Even if several modes are excited, the intensity tends to localize along the direction of the 2-
bounce PO emphasizing the main contribution of the scar mode in the superposition. In the FF
ﬁgure, two symmetric peaks are observed and show that mainly one transverse wave number
propagates along a well-deﬁned direction i.e, the direction of the 2-bounce PO. These observa-
tions have constituted the ﬁrst experimental evidence of scar modes in an optical ﬁber[12].

3 Looking for optical scars

The previous results have revealed the optical ﬁber as an ideal system to study the spatial be-
havior of waves in a chaotic billiard. If the properties of the ﬁeld associated to a superposition of
modes have been studied and analysed[7], the individual eigenmodes cannot be simply observed
due to diﬀraction at the ﬁber input. In particular, looking for an individual scar eigenmode ap-
pears to be a hard task. In order to investigate these rare eigenmodes, we have developped two
approaches. The ﬁrst one is dedicated to the signature of scar modes on the statistics of the
ﬁeld and intensity. Kaplan[13] and later Ishio[14] have studied the deviation to the Gaussian
statistics due to the presence of scar. In section 3.1, we present our preliminary results on the
imprint of scar on the statistics. The second approach refers to the ability to perform a selec-
tive excitation of scar by the way of optical ampliﬁcation. The problem of the introduction of a
gain region in a system that has special properties of propagation also encounters the concerns
of recent works on microlaser cavities or on disordered systems that will be made explicit in
section 3.2.

3.1 Signature of scars on the statistics

The deﬁnition of scars as an ”extra-density [of quantum eigenstates] surround[ing] the region
of periodic orbit ” in the pioneer paper by E. J. Heller[15] naturally leads to expect non stan-
dard properties for the distribution of the ﬁeld’s values. Deviations to the gaussian statistics
deduced from Berry’s conjecture for generic speckle modes have been studied numerically by
L. Kaplan[13]. Using the plane wave decomposition method introduced by Heller, we have cal-
culated the ﬁrst 2000 modes of a D-shaped ﬁber with Dirichlet boundary conditions (that is a
metallic D-shaped ﬁber). The behavior of these modes is quantitatively similar to those of our
dielectric optical ﬁber as soon as we consider low order modes. The main diﬀerences will be
due to the leakage of the modes in the dielectric ﬁber.
The ﬁgure 6 displays the intensity of two calculated eigenmodes: the strong localisation of inten-
sity along the 2-bounce PO observed for ﬁg.6(a) corresponds to a scar mode, whereas ﬁg.6(b) is

6

associated to a generic speckle mode. The probability distributions of the intensity associated
to these two characteristic modes compared to the Porter-Thomas distribution deduced from
the gaussian variable theory are shown in ﬁgure 6(c) et (d). If the probability distribution of
the intensity for the speckle mode is in good agreement with the Porter-Thomas distribution,
a strong deviation is observed for high values of intensity in the case of the scar mode. This
deviation is related to the ”extra-density” of the intensity along the direction of the periodic
orbit: high values for scar modes are more probable than for speckle modes.

As scar modes seem to mark the intensity distribution, one can expect to look for the presence
of scar modes in a superposition of several modes by analyzing the distribution of the intensity.
This assumption has been studied in the context of open billiards by H. Ishio et. al. who have
revealed the inﬂuence of ’regular states’ on the probability distribution of the superposition.
Experimentally, a favorable illumination is launched in the ﬁber in order to excite several modes
around the scar mode. As the transverse wave number of the ﬁber equals 18.6/R, the number
of contributing modes is roughly 30 so that no scar mode seems to emerge in the NF intensity
ﬁgure. Nevertheless, the probability distribution of intensity presents a strong deviation to the
Poisson distribution for high intensity values. This deviation can be attributed to the presence
of scar modes in the superposition. To check this assumption, we have turned the ﬁber so that
the initial illumination was no longer in the direction of the 2-bounce PO. No manifestation of
scar is detected neither in the NF nor in the intensity distribution that appears to be in very
good agreement with the Poisson distribution.
Using the calculated eigenmodes, we have artiﬁcially constructed a superposition of ﬁve modes
around a scar modes (see eq.3) where the coupling coeﬃcients are ﬁxed by the initial ﬁeld ψ0(r).
In one case, the initial ﬁeld is a plane wave with a transverse wave number associated to a scar
launched in the direction of the 2-bounce PO. In the other case, the same plane wave is launched

at an angle of 45 degrees. This launching condition is numerically equivalent to a rotation of
the ﬁber around its axis in the experiment. In the latter case, the coupling coeﬃcient of the
scar mode is very small. In both cases, we consider the ﬁeld resulting from a 1-m propagation.
The ﬁgure 7 presents the NF intensity and the probability distribution of the intensity for the
two diﬀerent launching conditions. The NF intensity is statistically uniformly distributed over
the whole transverse cross section showing no diﬀerence between the two cases. Nevertheless,
a deviation for high value of intensity is also observed for the ”scar” illumination whereas the
Poisson distribution is observed for the rotated initial condition.
As expected, as no scar is excited, no evidence of scar is observed. These results are prelimi-
nary and will be completed by a more systematic experimental investigation in a forthcoming
publication.

3.2 Optical Ampliﬁcation of Scar

3.2.1 General context

If Kudrolli et al. have studied the inﬂuence of nonlinear Faraday waves on the selection of
scar modes in a stadium shape container[21], very few investigations have been done on the
behavior of the chaotic wavefunctions in a nonlinear system. Recently, chaotic microlasers as-
sociated to wave chaos in the presence of gain have been the support of a great number of
investigations[23,24]. These studies have shown that a lasing eﬀect occurs on scar modes thanks
to their high quality factor, and the privileged directions of emission associated to scar modes
appear to be interesting to provide highly directional lasers.
In the context of wave propagation in complex media, some of the spatial properties of waves
in a disordered system are somewhat similar to those meet in chaotic system. For instance,
numerical investigations have recently shown that the ampliﬁed modes in a random laser are

the modes of the passive disordered system [26]. The same authors have shown that the iden-
tiﬁcation between lasing modes and passive modes holds even when the gain region is smaller
than the mode size[27].

We have shown that a passive optical ﬁber with a D-shape constitutes a powerful exper-
imental system for studying wave chaos. But above all, multimode D-shaped ﬁbers are also
widely used to achieve optical power ampliﬁers [29] in which a telecom signal (called the sig-
nal) is ampliﬁed at the cost of an ancillary signal (called the pump). Usually the optical index
of the Erbium or Ytterbium doped-core is higher than the index of the surrounding D-shape
cladding. The signal propagates in a single mode doped core, and, by guiding the pump, the
multimode ﬁber only plays the role of an energy reservoir. By some appropriate modiﬁcations
of the fabrication process, it is possible to obtain a negligible index mismatch between the small
active region and the multimode ﬁber 1, at least suﬃciently low to ensure that no guided mode
exists inside the doped area. Then, the signal and the pump propagate on the modes of the
entire section of the multimode D-shape ﬁber. In the following, we present realistic numerical
simulations of such a chaotic ﬁber with an Ytterbium-doped region. The simulation is based on
the Beam Propagation Method we already used successfully for simulating optical ampliﬁcation
[30]. We show how localized gain may selectively amplify a family of scar modes.

3.2.2 Results

In our multimode ﬁber, selective excitation of one eigenmode appears to be a tremendous task.
Selective excitation techniques as holographic masks of the modes or intracavity ﬁltering are
not appropriate in our case due to the complex patterns of the modes of the chaotic ﬁber. An
other technique of selective excitation consists in controlling the transverse wavenumber that
propagates along the ﬁber. This can be done by tuning the angle of a plane wave illumination
at the input of the ﬁber. Nevertheless, due to the ﬁnite aperture of the ﬁber, diﬀraction occurs
leading to a broadening of the value of the transverse wavenumber that propagates along the
ﬁber. For a plane wave exp(−iκtx) launched along the direction of the 2-bounce PO with a
value of κt = 23.45/R, we evaluate the spectral broadening to δκt = 14/R. As a consequence,
almost 50 modes are excited preventing any possibility to maintain the modal structure of the
scar along the propagation. To identify the guided modes along the propagation, we calculate
what we call a pseudo spectrum of our system. This pseudo-spectrum is derived from a stan-
dard semiclassical procedure developped by Heller[31] and adapted to our numerical algorithm
[32]. The pseudo spectrum is extracted from the Fourier transform of the correlation function
C(z) obtained from the overlap of the initial ﬁeld ψ0(r) with the propagating ﬁeld ψ(r, z). The
pseudo-spectrum of a plane wave illumination exp(−iκtx) with κt = 23.45/R together with
the NF and FF intensity at the output of the ﬁber are plotted in ﬁgure (9). In the NF ﬁgure,
the intensity is statistically uniformly distributed over the transverse cross section of the ﬁber
showing no localisation along the 2-bounce PO associated to the expected scar mode. The
loss of information about the direction of the initial plane wave can clearly be seen in the FF
intensity ﬁgure where the light tends to ﬁll a ring whose radius is centered on the input trans-
verse wavenumber κt. These pictures are actually associated to a superposition of the roughly
50 modes initially excited as can be seen in the pseudo spectum centered on the value of the
transverse wavenumber associated to the scar.
Introducing doping elements in an optical ﬁber is a current process to obtain optical ampliﬁ-
cation for instance. As the scar modes are characterized by an enhancement of intensity along
some particular direction in the transverse cross section of the ﬁber, we introduce active ions
along that direction to perform a selective ampliﬁcation through the strong interaction of the
ﬁeld with the doped area. With the experiment in mind, we have numerically investigated re-
alistic systems. What can be done experimentally is to introduce active rare earth ions in a
circular area centered on the axis of the 2-bounce PO. To make the doping area eﬃcient for our
purpose, two conditions have to be fulﬁlled: a)the location of this area has to be optimized to
favor the ampliﬁcation of the 2-bounce PO scar, b) this area should have the smallest feasible
refractive index diﬀerence with the core refractive index to prevent light from being guided in
the doped area. As a consequence, the doped area is located close to the position of the self-focal
point of the 2-bounce PO that also corresponds to a maximum of intensity of the scar modes
(see ﬁgure 3.2.2). Experimentally, the introduction of 1000ppm of Ytterbium ions leads to an
increase of the refractive index equal to 2.10−4. In spite of this small refractive index diﬀerence
between the doped area and the D-shaped core, light is actually guided in the doped area and
ampliﬁed. To overcome this problem, we use a Gaussian refractive index proﬁle which seems to
support no guided modes.

In this kind of system, optical ampliﬁcation occurs due to the transfer of energy from an optical
pump wave at the wavelength, λp = 980nm in our case, to the signal to be ampliﬁed at the
wavelength λs = 1020nm. Ytterbium is a four-level system that permits to use diﬀerent wave-
lengths for the pump and the signal preventing direct signal reabsorption. As a consequence,
Ytterbium in a silica matrix can be treated as a three energy-level system with a metastable
third energy level.

Using the evolution equations of the population density, one can easily obtain the following

expressions for the evolution of the pump and signal intensities[33]:

where Ip and Is are respectively the intensity of the pump and of the signal, σsa the absorption
cross section of the signal, σpa the absorption cross section for the pump and η = σse/σsa with
σse is the emission cross section of the signal. As soon as the intensity of the signal Is is low
compared to the intensity of the pump Ip, the eq. 5 only depends on Ip and the two equations
are partially coupled so that they can be treated separately. This case is fulﬁlled in our simu-
lation where the initial signal power Ps0 = 100µW and the pump power equals to Pp0 = 3W .
The Bpm algorithm is modiﬁed to take equations (5,6) into account to simulate the coupled
evolutions of the pump and the signal. To make an eﬃcient transfer of energy from the pump to
the signal, one has to maximize the number of excited pump modes: a focused laser beam at the
pump wavelength is therefore launched in the multimode core. A great number of modes of the

D-shaped core are thus excited and the overlap of their ﬁeld with the doped area is responsible
for the energy transfer from the pump to the signal. In previous works, we have shown that
the chaotic D-shaped geometry is an eﬃcient shape for this purpose[34]. The evolution of the
pump along the ﬁber follows an early exponential decay due to absorption in the doped area
that tends to saturate as soon as the pump power is no longer able to fulﬁll the population
inversion condition ηsN2 − N1 > 0.
We are now interested in the evolution of the signal associated to a plane wave illumination
in the direction of the 2-bounce PO of the selected scar with κt = 23.45/R. In ﬁgure (11), we
plot the NF and FF intensities computed for a distance zmax ≈ 2m associated to the maximum
gain value.

The intensity ﬁgures clearly show that the 2-bounce PO direction is privileged: in the NF inten-
sity, high intensities concentrate on the horizontal direction associated to the scar, and in the
FF intensity, two symmetric spots of intensity arise, located on the value of the initial κt. The
assumption, that the expected scar mode seems to emerge thanks to ampliﬁcation, is conﬁrmed
by the pseudo spectrum. The ﬁgure 12 represents the evolution of the pseudo spectrum along
the propagation. It is deduced from pseudo-instantaneous spectra computed for three sample of
propagation of length 5cm along the 4-m ﬁber. From a broad spectrum for z = 0m, we observe
that a selection of few peaks tends to emerge. Only some modes are being ampliﬁed along
the propagation, and the mode associated to the scar with value of κt = 23.45/R distinctly
dominates the spectrum.

Fig. 13. Spectrum calculated around the maximal value of the gain and the calculated modes associated
to its main peaks.

To clearly identify the excited modes, we perform a ﬁltering on the FF by applying a ring with
mean radius κt and a Gaussian proﬁle, κt being associated to one of the main peaks of the
spectrum. The corresponding NF is deduced from the inverse Fourier transform. By applying
the previous procedure to the value of κt related to the scar of order p=10, we have checked
that the spatial distribution of the intensity is associated to the corresponding scar mode (ﬁg
13). We have also checked that the peak labelled by κt = 10.9/R corresponds to the intensity
pattern of the scar of order p=4 along the 2-bounce PO. The NF intensities obtained by apply-
ing the ﬁltering procedure on diﬀerent values of κt respectively associated to the scar modes
of order p=4 and p=10 are plotted in an insert on ﬁgure 13 and compared to the correspond-
ing modes calculated for a waveguide with Dirichlet conditions. The intensity patterns for the
two ﬁltered-NF are similar to the individual calculated scars: the scar modes are ampliﬁed to
detriment of the ergodic modes.
To check the critical eﬀect of the location of the gain region on scar ampliﬁcation, we have
changed the location of the doped area. By moving the location of the doped region away from
the self-focal point of the 2-bounce PO, we observe no scar ampliﬁcation conﬁrming that the
gain region must have a maximal overlap with the scar to be eﬃcient.

The localization of light along the 2-bounce PO clearly demonstrates that the scar modes

have been excited and enhanced thanks to the interaction with the doped region.

4 Conclusion

The optical ﬁber with a truncated cross section appears to be a good candidate to image experi-
mentally wave chaos: complementary informations about the ﬁeld that propagates in the chaotic
billiard are deduced from the NF and FF intensity. The ergodic behavior of generic modes has
been proved experimentally and scar modes have ﬁrst been observed in an optical ﬁber. Due
to the inescapable diﬀraction at the ﬁber input, the properties of individual scar modes cannot
be studied experimentally. Nevertheless, their signature on the probability distribution of the
intensity appears to be pregnant: our preliminary investigations have shown that deviations to
the ergodic theory are to be expected as soon as a scar is excited on a superposition of modes.
To perform a selective excitation of scar modes in our multimode structure, we have investi-
gated the inﬂuence of a localized gain area on the propagation of a plane-wave illumination.
Our numerical results clearly show that scar modes are selectively ampliﬁed. The experimental
validation is in progress and will be the subject of a next publication.

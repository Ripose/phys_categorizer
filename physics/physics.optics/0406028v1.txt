One dimensional rectangular metallic gratings enable enhanced transmission of light for speciﬁc
resonance frequencies. Two kinds of modes participating to enhanced transmission have already
been demonstrated : (i) waveguide modes and (ii) surface plasmon polaritons (SPP). Since the
original paper of Hessel and Oliner [1] pointing out the existence of (i), no progress was made in
their understanding. We present here a carefull analysis, and show that the coupling between the
light and such resonances can be tremendously improved using an evanescent wave. This leads to
enhanced localisation of light in cavities, yielding, in particular, to a very selective light transmission
through these gratings.

The practical importance of the optical properties of
metallic gratings, is no more to underline [2]. Many im-
portant applications were found in several ﬁelds of sci-
ence, and are today extensively used in many kinds of
sensors and actuators. Recently, a further property of
gratings was found by Ebbesen et al. [3] : the discovery
of an optical transmission phenomena observed in two-
dimensional arrays of subwavelength holes perforated in
a thin metallic plate, which led to important theoretical
works [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. That experiment is however in a large
extend physically equivalent to a previous one reported
by Dragila et al.[9]. These authors showed that a thin
metallic opaque plate - without any holes - can transmit
light, provided that it is enlightened by an evanescent
wave generated by total reﬂection in a prism. For both
experiments, i.e. Dragila et al. or Ebbesen et al., the
physics is almost the same. In eﬀect, to excite a surface
plasmon on a ﬂate metallic surface, the incident wave
must have a wavevector component parallel to the sur-
face larger than k0 sin(θ), k0 = ω/c being the wavevector
of the incident light, and θ the incidence angle. There are
two possible ways to do that: by changing the parallel
component of the wavevector into a pseudo-wavevector
k// = k0 sin θ + 2πm/d, where m is a positive or neg-
ative integer, and d the period of the holes (case of a
perforated plate [3]); or by using an attenuated total re-
ﬂection (ATR) experiment [10]. The increase of the par-
allel wavevector component is thus provided by the to-
tal reﬂection on a prism from which an evanescent wave
emerges. In both cases, the surface plasmon polaritons
(SPP) of the external interfaces can be excited. However,
another condition is needed to have transmission through
the plate: SPP on both sides must be coupled. In the
case of perforated surface, it is essentially the evanescent
ﬁeld in the holes which mediates the coupling, while in
the case of ATR, evanescent waves inside the metal di-
rectly couples the plasmons of both interfaces. As was
pointed out in [11], for two dimensional subwavelength

(γ0 = 0, see the text) given for two values of the geometrical
parameter Γ = w/d for a perfect conductor (plain line). A

[17]) for Γ = 0.2 is also represented.

holes, the ﬁeld in the cavities is always evanescent, so
that the coupling, and thus the eﬃciency of the transmis-
sion, is bounded by the thickness of the plate: a too thick
plate perforated with subwavelenth holes would transmit
almost nothing. It is the same in the case of ATR exper-
iment where the eﬃciency of the coupling is limited by
the ﬁeld decay in the metal, linked to the skin depth.

Such a thickness

limitation may not exist

for
one-dimensional periodically structured ﬁlm as those
sketched on the inset of ﬁg.1. It was eﬀectively shown
experimentally and theoretically [4, 11, 12] that a second
mechanism is important : the light can be transmitted by
excitation of one of the waveguide modes of the slits of the

2

resonances of gratings (even perfectly conducting) have
complex wavevectors as was previously pointed out in
[1]. When they are excited by a radiating incident wave
whose wavevector is real, it can not perfectly match with
the complex one of the eigenmode and the resonance is a
forced one. On the opposite, we expect a higher Q-factor
when exciting the waveguide resonance with a complex
wavevector obtained from an ATR conﬁguration.

Let us examine these two cases from a simpliﬁed the-
oretical point of view. We consider a grating with geo-
metrical parameters d, h and w (see ﬁg. 1) enlightened
(close to the surface) with a p-polarized incident wave
z = eik0[γ0x−β0y]. Due to the Helmoltz equation (in

0. Now, if γ0 ≤
generality γ0 ≥
incident wave with a real wavevector, while if γ0 > 1,
we have an evanescent ﬁeld with complex wavevector.
Within the modal method, used for the calculations and
fully described elsewhere [12, 16], it is easy to show that,
in case of subwavelength slits (w << λ = 2π/k0), the
magnetic ﬁeld in the slits is proportional to 1/∆(k0),

When equ.(2) is satisﬁed, the imaginary part becomes:

all along this paper a spectral region where no SPP can

gratings (diﬀerent than SPPs). Indeed, in this geometry
(rectangular slits), and with a p-polarized incident wave
i.e. magnetic ﬁeld along the z-axis, the grating supports
modes that propagate into the slits along the y-axis, even
when these have a subwavelength width w, and whatever
their thickness h is [11]. However, the transmission by
such a mechanism is poorly selective and the waveguide
resonance spectral width is large [11]. In the infrared re-
gion, a half-width of about 1000 cm−1 was reported for a
resonant transmission close to 0.4 occuring at 2530 cm−1
[11]. Recently, using the same rectangular geometry, but
with a more complicated architecture made of one sin-
gle slit close to several other grooves, Martin-Moreno et
al. [13] succeeded to improve the eﬃciency of the trans-
mission through the slit by combination of diﬀerent geo-
metrical parameters which allowed coincidence of several
waveguide resonances.

Waveguide modes of subwavelength metallic gratings
in deep structured surfaces, predicted by Hessel and
Oliner [1], was experimentally observed later [14]. The
ordinary theory of cavity resonators (see [15] for instance)
tells us that for any closed metallic cavity, i.e. a con-
nected volume, there are proper modes which can carry
high electromagnetic ﬁeld. However, the resonance is
bounded by the absorption of the metallic walls of the
cavity which leads to a ﬁnite width in the resonance
peaks also called Q-factor. If the optical absorption is
weak, as it is the case for gold in the infrared, the res-
onances remain very narrow and well-deﬁned. Another
damping mechanism appears when a hole is made in the
cavity, taking solely its origin in the geometry. In other
words, the real wavevectors of the eigenmodes of a per-
fectly conducting closed cavity becomes complex by the
opening of a hole with a ﬁnite size. This is exactly what
happens in deeply structured gratings where the slits play
the role of the hole cited above and therefore waveguide

To have a total reﬂexion at the interface (I)/(II), we

both vanishe at the resonance. This is the point we
want to highlight in this letter: an evanescent incident
wave would excite much better the waveguide mode of
the grating.

To illustrate this point, we examine the case of a grat-
ing illuminated by evanescent wave, coming from an ATR
conﬁguration as sketched on ﬁgure 2. A ﬁrst (hemi-
cylindrical) prism is positioned above the grating to cre-
ate the evanescent incoming wave while the second one
plays the opposite role, converting the evanescent trans-
mitted ﬁeld into a propagating one. Both prism have a
high refractive index ˜n = 4 corresponding to that of the
Germanium in the infrared [17] and are at a distance h0
from the grating considered to be a purely gold structure
imbedded in air (n1 = 1). Following the modal expan-
sion method [11, 12, 16], the space is divided into ﬁve
regions: regions (I) and (V) are the prisms, (II) and (IV)
are the air and (III) is the empty region (air) of the grat-
ing, where the magnetic ﬁeld is expanded as:

phenomena arises for the transmission which is directly
connected to the ﬁeld enhancement in the slits. A com-
promise is thus necessary between the gain in the width
of the resonance, which always decreases with increasing
h0 up to its lower bound O(
)), and the eﬃciency of
|
|
the transmission. The angle of incidence also enters in
the expression of Z0 so that the results are very sensitive
to it owing to the exponential dependance of the diﬀer-
ent terms. Fig.4 shows the zero order transmission for
h0 = 1.5 µm for diﬀerent angles. As can be seen, the re-
duction of the resonance width W of the transmission is
spectacular. The resonance widths obtained for θ = 17o,
18o, 19o, and 20o, are respectively W = 170 cm−1, 50
cm−1, 20 cm−1 and 9 cm−1, while the transmissions are
maintened to high values, respectively 0.85, 0.70, 0.45,
and 0.25. These kind of devices could be employed to
create polarization ﬁlters with extremely narrow widths.
Finally, we have shown in this paper that the cavity res-
onances excitation can be notably improved, yielding a
strong localization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The key
point is the use of an evanescent incident wave, illus-
trated here by an ATR conﬁguration. However, many
other devices producing evanescent waves could also be
employed to enhance the ﬁeld in such cavities.

strictly, the width of the resonance tends to zero as
In the same time,
h0 →
the ﬁeld in the groove exponentially increases, while the
transmission tends to 1 just at the resonance frequency
and to zero elsewhere. For a real metal, i.e with ﬁnite
(even very small) η, there is a qualitative change. First,
the width of the resonance is bounded, and tends to a
very small, but ﬁnite value O(
). In that case both the

ﬁeld and the transmission vanish owing to the exponen-
tial factor in the numerator. All these statements, can be
understood physically : as h0 becomes larger, the num-
ber of photons which arrives on the grating exponentially
vanishes. If there is no absorption at all, the resonance
can be excited, while if there is an absorption, a part of
incident photons are absorbed, while the remaining ones
excite the resonance. When there is no photons anymore,
the resonance cannot be excited. This eﬀect is shown on
ﬁg.3, where the resonance width is strongly reduced as
expected and a maximum of enhancement of the ﬁeld is
observed around h0 = 1.5 µm. For larger h0 the ﬁeld
decreases as can be seen for h0 = 2.5 µm. The same

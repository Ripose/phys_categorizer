Abstract. Periodic layered media can reﬂect strongly for all incident angles
and polarizations in a given frequency range. Quarter-wave stacks at normal
incidence are commonplace in the design of such omnidirectional reﬂectors. We
discuss alternative design criteria to optimize these systems.
Keywords: Multilayers, Mirrors, Reﬂection, Filters

1. Introduction

At optical frequencies, metallic mirrors reﬂect strongly for any angle of incidence
and any polarization. However, they display dissipative losses, which constitutes a
drawback in practical applications. Photonic crystals [1] were originally proposed by
Yablonovitch [2] to solve this problem: they are periodically microstructured materials
that reﬂect in stop (forbidden) bands within which light propagation is not possible
in an inﬁnite structure. Since they are made from transparent materials, photonic
crystals can be almost free of losses at any prescribed frequency.

In the one-dimensional case, a photonic crystal is nothing other than a periodic
multilayer. Although much attention has been payed to dielectric Bragg mirrors
consisting of alternating low- and high-index layers, certain aspects of the reﬂection
by periodic layered media are universal: for N periods the reﬂectance goes to unity
as N −2 at the band edges, while tends to unity exponentially at the band gaps [3, 4].
This means that, in practice, not very many periods are needed to have a stop
band. One is then led to consider stacks of N periods (which are often called ﬁnite
periodic structures) and apply to them conditions that are valid only when the system
is strictly inﬁnite. Recently [5, 6], we have put forward this problem and provided an
alternative framework for dealing with these ﬁnite periodic structures: the trace of the
basic period allows us to classify them into three classes with quite diﬀerent properties.
Concerning the performance of these structures, it is indisputable that Bragg
quarter-wave stacks (designed for normal incidence) are the most thoroughly studied
in connection with omnidirectional reﬂection [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In spite of this, the
current interest in extreme ultraviolet [13] and soft x-ray [14] optics is driving a
great deal of work on new methods for optimizing the design of multilayer mirrors.
In addition to the simple but cumbersome optimization by eye, only recently more
sophisticated techniques have been started to be used [15]: relevant examples include
the downhill simplex algorithm [16], the systematic search in the parameters space [17],

the simulating annealing [18], the needle variation technique [19], the Levenberg-
Marquardt algorithm [20], or genetic algorithms [21]. The aim of this paper is to
provide an alternative optimization criterion that has the virtue of using a simple
analytical ﬁgure of merit with a very clear physical meaning.

2. Notations and general relations

We start by examining the properties of the basic period of our structure, which
is assumed to be lossless. The ﬁeld amplitudes at each side (called ambient and
substrate) of the unit cell are related by the 2 × 2 complex transfer matrix Mas that
can be expressed as [22, 23]

Mas =

1/Tas
Ras/Tas

(cid:18)

R∗
as/T ∗
as
1/T ∗
as (cid:19)

≡

(cid:18)

α
β
β∗ α∗ (cid:19)

,

where Ras and Tas are, respectively, the overall reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients
for a wave incident from the ambient. Note that for identical ambient and substrate
media we have det Mas = +1, which is equivalent to |Ras|2 + |Tas|2 = 1.

We take as known the theory of reﬂection from multilayers [4] and its main result
for our purposes, namely that strong reﬂection will occur when [Tr (Mas)]2 > 4 (these
conditions, one for the s polarization and one for the p polarization, locate the band
stops for each basic polarization).

When we consider a ﬁnite periodic system that consists of N basic periods, it is
possible to show that in the stop bands the reﬂectance takes the general form [4,5,24]

R(N ) =

|β|2
|β|2 + [sinh(χ)/ sinh(N χ)]2 ,

where cosh(χ) = Re(α). We are considering only positive values of Re(α) since negative
values can be treated much in the same way.

In practice, it is usual that the basic period of the structure consists of two thin
homogeneous dielectric slabs with low, nℓ, and high, nh, indices of refraction and
corresponding thicknesses dℓ and dh. These Bragg structures are also appropriately
denoted as [LH]N , where N is the total number of periods. In such a case, the condition
[Tr (Mas)]2 > 4, required to have a stop band, can be written as [12]

|Re (α)| = | cos δℓ cos δh − Λℓh sin δℓ sin δh| > 1,

where δi = (2π/λ)∆i is the phase shift of a wave of wavelength in vacuum λ in
traversing the layer ith and ∆i is the corresponding optical path, of value

∆i = nidi cos θi = di

i − sin2 θ0,

θ0 being the angle of incidence. For simplicity, we have assumed that the system is
imbedded in air.

The function Λℓh is

Λℓh =

1 + r2

,

where rℓh is the Fresnel reﬂection coeﬃcient for the interface ℓ-h. This function Λℓh
is frequency independent but takes diﬀerent forms for s and p polarizations. However,

Optimizing omnidirectional reﬂection by multilayer mirrors

one can check that, irrespective of the angle of incidence, the following relation for
both basic polarizations holds:

Λℓh(p)
Λℓh(s)

=

nℓ

(cid:18)

< 1.

Due to the restriction (6), whenever Eq. (3) is fulﬁlled for p polarization, it is always
true also for s polarization. In consequence, the p-polarization stop bands are more
stringent than the corresponding s-polarization ones.

Because of historical reasons [25], typical use of dielectric mirrors has been
evaluated at normal incidence, with layers at a quarter-wavelength thick (at the design
frequency):

which is the center of the stop band.

3. Optimization strategy

In order to explain the optimization criterion we wish to propose, in Fig. 1 we have
plotted the reﬂectance R(N ) of a Bragg [LH]N structure as a function of the angle of
incidence for several values of the number of periods N and for p polarization. The
layer thicknesses are chosen as in Eq. (7).

It is clear from this ﬁgure the well-known fact that the reﬂectance tends to unity as
N increases. It is then hardly surprising that the usual designs found in the literature
use the quarter-wave thicknesses at normal incidence without raising any doubt about
such assumption. In practice not very many periods (say N ∼ 10) are used in the
visible, and one may be tempted to ask whether other thicknesses could improve the
performance of the structure. Such a problem could be attacked by a straightforward
computation of the reﬂectance as a function of layer thicknesses. With the a priori
information that the optimum condition is close to a quarter wave stack, it will not take
too much computational eﬀort to ﬁnd a reasonable solution [26, 27, 28, 29]. However,
our goal here is to provide a more systematic way of dealing with this question.

A reasonable option for optimizing the system is that, when θ0 varies from 0 to
π/2, the area under the curve 1 − R(N ) (which is the transmittance of the system)
would be as small as possible. Therefore, once the materials and the wavelength are
ﬁxed, we propose

A(dℓ, dh) =

[1 − R(N )(dℓ, dh, θ0)] dθ0,

(9)

π/2

as ﬁgure of merit for the periodic structure. Alternatively, given the characteristic dip
appearing in the reﬂectance for p polarization, one could also impose that this dip
would be as smaller as possible. We have numerically checked that both criteria give
essentially the same results.

For s polarization there is no dip. The diﬀerent behaviour at oblique incidences
of s and p reﬂectances has been analyzed previously [3]. Since for a given stack the
reﬂectance R(N ) is greater for s polarization than for p polarization for every incidence

labeled with the corresponding number of periods N .

angle (they are equal only at normal and grazing incidences), we argue that once the
area A(dℓ, dh) is optimized for p polarization, it is also improved for s polarization,
which seems quite plausible.

We have employed an easy-to-use quasi-Newton algorithm in order to ﬁnd the
minimum of the function (9), subject only to the physical conditions 0 < dℓ/λℓ ≤ 1
and 0 < dh/λh ≤ 1, because the periodic character of the solutions. The numerical
results of this optimization are shown in Table 1. Note that the use of adimensional
thicknesses dℓ/λℓ and dh/λh simpliﬁes the presentation of the results, although by no
means the results are universal: they apply only to this particular system because
we are not considering dispersion in refractive indices (in all the paper we take the
wavelength in vacuum λ = 10µm). In any case, the proposed optimization strategy is
independent of the particular example under study.

For a better understanding of the performance of our optimized structure, in Fig. 2
we have plotted the reﬂectance R(N ) (with N = 4 and N = 7) and p polarization for
both the quarter-wave thicknesses as in Eq.(7) and the optimum thicknesses in Table
in terms of areas, we have 20 % and 100 %,
1. The improvement is remarkable:
respectively.

dℓ/λℓ and dh/λh for the same structure as in Fig. 2 with N = 7 periods. The
labels in the contour lines show the value of the area (except for a factor 10−2).
The optimum working point corresponds to the center of the grid.

To test the tolerance of the optimum thicknesses against small deviations, in
Fig. 3 we have a contour plot of A(dℓ, dh) as a function of the adimensional thicknesses
dℓ/λℓ and dh/λh for the same structure as in Fig. 2 with N = 7 periods. The elliptical
contours delimit the range of thicknesses giving a deﬁnite value of the area. Moreover,
if we take the projection of the major axis of the ellipse on the coordinate axes as

Optimizing omnidirectional reﬂection by multilayer mirrors

a qualitative measure of the maximum tolerance for a given area, we conclude from
Fig. 3 that one must be more careful in controlling the thickness dℓ than dh.

Figure 4. Contour plot of the area as a function of the refractive indices nℓ and
nh for the same structure as in Fig. 3 but with ﬁxed optimum thicknesses dℓ and
dh given in Table 1. The labels in the contour lines show the value of the area
(except for a factor 10−2).

In the same spirit, one could ask about how critical is the behaviour of the area
under deviations in the values of refractive indices. In Fig. 4 we have plotted a contour
plot of the area as a function of nℓ and nh for the optimum thicknesses dℓ and dh given
in Table 1 for N = 7. We ﬁnd again the same kind of elliptical contours as in the
previous ﬁgure, but now the variation is much smoother, indicating that, roughly
speaking, the role of refractive indices is not so crucial as the role of thicknesses.

Obviously, as N grows the improvement in the area is larger.

In fact, table
1 suggests a considerable improvement that, to some extent, may be illusory:
it
only concerns a decrease in the integrated transmission, while for the reﬂection,
the improvement is not so impressive. However, the important point is that the
improvement is just in the dip of the reﬂectance. We conclude ﬁnally that the method
is especially appropriate for moderate values of N (N ∼ 10), which constitute a typical
experimental situation.

The results presented so far hold only for the given ratio of refractive indices. To
show that the method can be employed for arbitrary parameters of the multilayers, in
Fig. 5 we have plotted the optimum adimensional thickness (dℓ/λℓ)opt as a function of
the refractive indices for N = 7, while in Fig. 6 we have represented the optimum
values of (dh/λh)opt. We have assigned a zero thickness whenever the condition
[Tr (Mas)]2 ≥ 4, required to have a stop band, is not fulﬁlled for some values of

the incidence angle θ0. The abrupt step is the same in both ﬁgures and gives the
boundary of omnidirectional reﬂection for the stack.

As a general feature, we note that (dℓ/λℓ)opt < (dh/λh)opt for every pair of
allowed refractive indices. In Fig. 5, the optimum thickness varies pronouncedly with
nℓ until nℓ ≃ 1.5 and then it is almost constant, while decreases slowly with nh in
the region of interest. In Fig. 6 we observe that the optimum thickness decreases for
a ﬁxed value of nℓ (resp. nh) when nh (resp. nℓ) increases, and has a ﬂat variation.
The same qualitative behaviour is also observed for other values of N .

In summary, we have proposed a simple ﬁgure of merit that allows for an

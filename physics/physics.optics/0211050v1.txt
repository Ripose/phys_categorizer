We numerically study the possibilities for improved large-mode area endlessly single mode pho-
tonic crystal ﬁbers for use in high-power delivery applications. By carefully choosing the optimal
hole diameter we ﬁnd that a triangular core formed by three missing neighboring air holes consid-
erably improves the mode area and loss properties compared to the case with a core formed by one
missing air hole. In a realized ﬁber we demonstrate an enhancement of the mode area by ∼ 30 %
without a corresponding increase in the attenuation.

Applications requiring high-power delivery call
for
single-mode large-mode area (LMA) optical ﬁbers. While
standard-ﬁber technology has diﬃculties in meeting these
requirements the new class[1] of all-silica photonic crys-
tal ﬁbers (PCF) has a big potential due to their endlessly
single-mode properties [2] combined with (in principle)
unlimited large eﬀective areas.[3] For recent reviews we
refer to Refs. 4, 5.

The cladding structure of these PCFs consists of a tri-
angular array of air holes of diameter d and pitch Λ cor-
responding to an air-ﬁlling fraction f = π/(2√3)(d/Λ)2.
The presence of the air holes results in a strongly wave-
length dependent eﬀective index neﬀ of the cladding and
in the short and long wavelength limits we have

with α of order unity and only weakly dependent on d/Λ,
see Fig. 1.
It is these unusual dispersion properties of
the cladding which facilitate design of large-mode area
endlessly single-mode optical ﬁbers.[2, 3]

In order to conﬁne the light to a core region of high
index a defect in the triangular air-hole array is intro-
duced. Normally this is done by leaving out one of the
air holes. In the stack-and-pull approach [1] one of the
capillaries is replaced by a silica rod, see left insert of
Fig. 3. By choice the index of the defect can be raised
by various doping and depressed-index core has also been
studied recently.[6]

The single-rod PCF can in principle be kept endlessly
single-mode no matter how large a core diameter.[3] How-
ever, when scaling-up the ﬁbre-structure the mode area is
increased at the cost of an increased susceptibility to lon-
gitudinal modulations [7] such as e.g. micro-bending [8]
and macro-bending [9] induced scattering loss. The rea-
son is that in order to increase the mode area the pitch
Λ is scaled to a large value, but this also implies that
λ/Λ
1 and in this limit the core index approaches
the cladding index, see Eq. (1). Fig. 1 suggests that

≪

∼

the decreasing index step may be compensated by in-
creasing the air hole diameter, which can be done up to
0.45 which is the upper limit for endlessly single-
d/Λ
mode operation. For a discussion of the particular mum-
ber see e.g. Refs. 10, 11, 12. For LMA PCFs working in
the UV and visible regimes this sets an upper limit on the
mode areas that can be realized with a reasonable loss
and many applications call for an improved LMA PCF
design.

The inclusion of more than a single solid rod in the
stacking has been used to form multiple-core [13] and
highly birefringent PCFs.[14] In this work we demon-
strate how inclusion of more neighboring solid rods can
be used for improved LMA endlessly single-mode PCFs.
Intuitively this may not seem to be a promising direction
since a reduced value of d/Λ is needed to keep the PCF
endlessly single-mode. For the birefringent case with two
0.30 and for a tri-
neighboring rods[14] the limit is d/Λ

∼

d/Λ = 0.30, α = 1.40
d/Λ = 0.35, α = 1.30

angular core formed by three neighboring rods (see right
insert of Fig. 3) we have found d/Λ
0.25 as the upper
limit for endlessly single-mode operation. However, for a
given desired mode area this decrease in d/Λ is compen-
sated for by a corresponding smaller value of Λ. In fact,
the edge-to-edge separation Λ
d of the holes turns out
to be the important length scale rather than the pitch Λ
itself.

In introducing a multiple number of rods an impor-
tant question about possible birefringence arises. The
structure with a single rod has a six-fold symmetry and
though group theory clearly excludes any intrinsic bire-
fringence [15] there has been quite some debate based on
numerical studies, see e.g. Ref. 16 and references therein.
More generally, group theory predicts that for m-fold ro-
tational symmetry and m > 2 a mode with a preferred
direction is one of a pair, see Ref. 15 and references
therein. PCFs with a triangular core formed by three
neighboring rods have a 3-fold symmetry and thus no
intrinsic birefringence. The non-birefringent property is
also conﬁrmed numerically using a fully-vectorial plane-
wave method [17] and any small numerical birefringence
originates from a numerical grid with symmetry diﬀerent
from the dielectric structure being studied.

In order to compare the single-rod and three-rod PCFs
we study two quantities; i) the mode-ﬁeld diameter MFD
and ii) the coupling length ζ to the cladding. We relate
the MFD to the eﬀective area[11]

by Aeﬀ = π(MFD/2)2. Here, I(r⊥) is the transverse
intensity distribution of the fundamental mode. For a
Gaussian mode of width w Eq. (3) gives MFD = 2w and
the intensity distribution in the types of PCF studied in
this work can be considered close to Gaussian[11, 18] as
we also conﬁrm experimentally.

and otherwise loss can be expected to be small. Thus,
the shorter a coupling length the lower susceptibility
to longitudinal modulations. We emphasize that this
criterion does not quantify loss, but it gives a correct
parametric dependence of loss for various loss mecha-
nisms. For PCFs the relevance of this criteria was re-
cently conﬁrmed experimentally in the case of macro-

In Fig. 2 we compare the single-rod and three-rod
PCFs with d/Λ = 0.45 and 0.25, respectively. All nu-
merical results are based on a fully-vectorial solution of
Maxwell’s equations in a plane-wave basis[17] and for sil-
ica we have for simplicity used nsi = 1.444. Panel (a)
shows the coupling length versus wavelength. The nor-
malization by the edge-to-edge separation Λ
d of the
air holes makes the two curves coincide at short wave-
lengths (λ

d is the length scale of the ﬁber structure which de-

termines the susceptibility to longitudinal modulations.

Fig. 3 shows experimental results for the attenuation
of both a single-rod PCF and a three-rod PCF with hole
diameters (d/Λ
0.45 and 0.25, respectively) close to
the endlessly single-mode limits. The pitches are Λ
≃
10 µm and Λ
6 µm, respectively, so that core sizes are
approximately the same. The two PCFs were fabricated
by aid of the stack-and-pull method under comparable
conditions and both PCFs were found to be endlessly
single-mode in a wavelength range of at least 400 nm to
1600 nm. As seen the two PCFs have similar spectral
attenuation even though the mode area of the three-rod
PCF is enhanced by
30 % compared to the single-rod
PCF. This demonstrate the improvement by the three-
rod PCF.

In conclusion we have found that a triangular core
formed by three missing neighboring air holes consid-
erably improves the mode area and/or loss properties
compared to the case with a core formed by one missing
air hole. This new improved large-mode area endlessly
single-mode PCF is important for high-power delivery
applications and in a realized ﬁber we have been able to
demonstrate an enhancement of the mode area by
30 %
without a corresponding change in the loss level.

ﬁeld diameter around 10.5 µm whereas the three-rod PCF has
Λ ≃ 6 µm, d/Λ ≃ 0.25, and a mode-ﬁeld diameter around

hanced by ∼ 30 % compared to the single-rod PCF the two

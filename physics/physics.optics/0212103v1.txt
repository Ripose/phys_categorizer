In this study, it is shown with reasons that superposition priniple does

not work in vauum. This ase an be observed by Young type double slit

experiment to be arried out. Sine (cid:28)eld-(cid:28)eld interation is arried through

harged partiles, in the absene of harged partiles linear superposition of

two (cid:28)elds is not possible and interferene will not be observed.

Introdution

As it is known, the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld is expressed by linear equations both

in lassial and quantum mehanis. Nevertheless, the idea of neessity of ex-

pressing the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld by a nonlinear equation has always kept the

physiists mind busy. Classially, the nonlinear theory of Born and Infeld

is

the most known among these. Although no evidene of neessity of the non-

linearity of the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld was obtained lassially, in quantum

mehanis this situation is a little di(cid:27)erent. Due to unertainty priniple,

photon-photon interation

(whih is known as Delbrük sattering) is possi-

2

ble by the way that the two photons vanish by reating an eletron-positron

pair and afterwards annihilation of the eletron-positron pair to reate a dif-

ferent photon pair. In this ase, the eletri and magneti permeability tensor

of vauum

-arrying information about the eletron-positron pair- will not

be equal to 1, and sine the eletri and magneti (cid:28)eld will slowly hange.

As two things of same harater would not interat diretly, information

only ould be obtained indiretly in nature. That is, we an obtain informa-

tion about harged partiles through (cid:28)eld and about (cid:28)eld through harged

partiles. Sine (cid:28)eld-(cid:28)eld interation is through harged partiles, in the ab-

sene of harged partiles we annot obtain information about a (cid:28)eld through

the other (cid:28)eld. On the aount of unertainty priniple, sine simultaneous

measurements on both (cid:28)eld and harged partiles is not possible, de(cid:28)nite

information about one would destroy information about the other. Hene,

while using information about (cid:28)eld information about harged partile will

not appear in this expression. However, while information loss due to un-

ertainty priniple is taken into aount, linear superposition of two (cid:28)elds in

vauum would not be possible for the extra terms appearing. The ob jetive

of this study is to show that linear superposition priniple does not work in

vauum. For this purpose, it will be shown both in lassial and quantum

eletrodynamis (QED) aspets that linear superposition priniple will not

work for the Young type double-slit experiment to be performed in vauum

and hene interferene pattern will not be observed.

2 Classial Desription of Interferene

Aording to the lassial theory, interferene ours from two eletromag-

neti (cid:28)elds passing through double-slit.

Linearly polarized monohromati plane waves passing through eah slit an

be expressed as

Ei(r, t) = Eiei(kir−ωit−Φi), (i = 1, 2)
Here, Ei is the real amplitude, ki the wave vetor, ωi the irrular frequeny
and Φi the phase. In this ase, the eletri (cid:28)eld at point (r, t) is expressed

(4)

as the linear superposition of two (cid:28)elds,

E(r, t) = E1(r1, t) + E2(r2, t)

(5)

and intensity is the square of E(r, t)

I(r, t) = E2

1 + E2

2 + 2E1E2cos[(k2 − k1)r − (ω2 − ω2)t − (Φ2 − Φ1)] (6)

Classially, the book of Born and Wolf

may be looked at for information on

theory and experiment.

3 Quantum Mehanial Desription

In QED, the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld is obtained by the quantization of lassial

eletromagneti (cid:28)eld

. In that ase, the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld may be written

5

as a sum of two parts ontaining positive and negative frequenies.

E(r, t) = E(+)(r, t) + E(−)(r, t)

E(+)(r, t) = [E(+)(r, t)]†

Field passing through two slits may be written as

E(+)(r, t) = f(r, t)(a1eik1r1 + a2eik2r2)

Here, a1 and a2 are reation operator and

f (r, t) = i(¯hω/2)1/2(ˆek/4πR)1/2e−iωt/r

R is the normalized volume radius and ˆek is the unit polarization vetor. In

that ase, intensity is in the following form.

I(r, t) = Tr(ρE(−)(r, t)E(+)(r, t)

Here, ρ is density operator expressing (cid:28)eld state. Inserting (2.5) (2.6) and

(2.7) into (2.8),

I(r, t) = N[Tr(ρa†

1a1) + Tr(ρa†

2a2) + 2Tr(a†

1a2)cosΦ]

(12)

will be obtained. Here,

T r(ρa†

1a2) = T r(ρa†

1a2)eiφ

N = |f (r, t)|2

Φ = k(r1 − r2) + φ

IV. Young Type Double-Slit Experiment in

Vauum

Classially, in the Young type double-slit experiment, for the two (cid:28)elds to

be able make interferene neessitates that the (cid:28)eld passing through one slit

must know the geometry of the (cid:28)eld passing through another slit, and vie

versa. In that ase, it is neessary that the (cid:28)elds passing through two slit

to interat. Sine in vauum (cid:28)eld-(cid:28)eld interation is not possible, the linear

superposition priniple will not work and hene interferene will not be ob-

served. In QED, even though not present in literature yet, it is being dwelled

upon the idea of the Dira's

statement: (cid:16)Eah photon interferes only with

6

itself. Interferene between di(cid:27)erent photons never ours(cid:17) The seond part

of this statement has been proven to be wrong by Forrester, Godmundson

and Johnson

and as well as by Brown and Twiss

by showing that pho-

8

9

tons emitted by di(cid:27)erent atoms exhibit interferene. Taylor

, Janossy and

Naray

showed that interferene was obtained by sending single photons.

Lets onsider an eletron isolated from its surroundings. As the eletron in-

terats with a photon, it will arry the information belonging to the photon

any more. And as the eletron interats with a seond photon, it will transfer

the information belonging the (cid:28)rst photon to the seond one. From the phys-

ial point of view, there is no any di(cid:27)erene whether the interation takes

plae simultaneously or at di(cid:27)erent times exept time. For that reason, in

the double-slit experiment to be performed by sending single photons in the

presene of harged partiles, the photon passing through a slit will identify

the geometry of the other slit through harged partiles and interferene will

be possible in that way. In the ase of performing the Young type double-

slit experiment in vauum by sending single photons, sine there will be no

interation between the photons, interferene will not our. As a onse-

quene, interferene between di(cid:27)erent photons is possible in the presene of

harged partiles. Sine the superposition priniple will not work in vauum,

if the ontribution resulting from unertainty priniple is ignored, the inten-

sity will be equal to the sum of intensities of the (cid:28)elds passing through two

slit. Hene, the intensity expressions in (2.3) and (2.9) will be of the form:

I(r, t) = E2

1 + E2
2

I(r, t) = N[Tr(ρa†

1a1) + Tr(ρa†

2a2)]

(16)

(17)

Sine wave will not pass through vauum, partiles will pass. In that ase,

what to be observed in the Young type double-slit experiment in vauum

will be the partile harateristis of light. Furthermore, if the information

4

of the (cid:28)rstly passing photons is lost, in the double-slit experiment arried

out by sending single photons, due to external e(cid:27)ets or due to interations

between the harged partiles present in the environment still interferene

will not our. This ase was demonstrated through an experiment arried

out by P(cid:29)eegor and Mandel

by the use of two independent same type laser

11

soures. They stated that when the time interval between the sent times of

photons is inreased it was not possible to observe interferene.

5 Disussion

Sine in nature, information ould be obtained only by indiret means it will

not be possible for a photon to make interferene with itself. Interferene

between di(cid:27)erent photons is possible only in the presene of harged partiles.

In that ase, it is neessary that both statements of Dira's to be false. This

ase an be observed by a Young type double-slit experiment in vauum. For

the reasons explained above, linear superposition of two (cid:28)elds in vauum will

not be possible and hene interferene will not be observed.

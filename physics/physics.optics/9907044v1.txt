Abstract

Chaotic bursts are observed in a single-mode microchip Nd:YVO4 laser with

ﬁber feedback. The physical characteristic of the instability is a random

switching between two diﬀerent dynamical states, i.e., the noise-driven relax-

ation oscillation and the chaotic spiking oscillation. As the feedback strength

varied, transition which features the strong interplay between two states ex-

hibits and the dynamical switching is found to be non-stationary at the tran-

sition.

The complex dynamics in nonlinear systems with delayed feedback which possesses inﬁ-

nite dimensions are of current interest in various ﬁelds including physics, chemistry, biology,

economy, physiology, neurology, and optical systems [1]. Especially, instabilities of nonlinear

optical resonators and lasers with delayed feedback have attracted much attention in the past

decade. In history, the issue of chaotic instabilities in the output of lasers which is subjected

to external feedback was initiated by the pioneering work of Lang and Kobayashi in 1980

[2]. They demonstrated the dynamical instabilities in a semiconductor laser with external

feedback which features the sustaining relaxation oscillations. They also conﬁrmed theoret-

ically that the dynamical instabilities take place in the transition process where the lasing

frequency changes from one external cavity eigenmode to another in a weak-coupling regime.

Thereafter, three universal transition routes to chaos, low-frequency ﬂuctuations (LFF) and

coherence collapse have been observed in semiconductor lasers with external optical feed-

back for diﬀerent feedback strength and/or delay time regions [3]. To LFF and coherence

collapse, there still exists the open question to concern the role of noise [4]. Nowadays,

another promising laser system for investigating the instabilities in lasers with delayed feed-

back would be the laser-diode-pumped microchip solid-state lasers which have been widely

used in the practical applications. They are expected to exhibit extremely high-sensitive

response to the external feedback. The reason is that the cavity round-trip time τL (∝ τp:

photon lifetime) compared with the ﬂuoresecence lifetimes τ is extremely short as demon-

strated in self-mixing laser Doppler velocimetries [5]. Generally, the lifetime ratio K = τ /τp

of solid lasers ranges from 105 to 107, while K ⋍ 103 in laser diodes. Furthermore, their

characteristic frequencies are of sub-MHz, thus the conventional measurement techniques

can be utilized easily. Therefore, it will be much easier to study the various instabilities

in solid-state laser systems than in laser diode systems.

In fact, in the early experiment

in 1979, Otsuka observed various instabilities in a microchip LNP (LiNdP4O12) solid-state

laser subjected to external feedback [6]. However, the instability is only observed in the

region of two lasing modes. It is expected that the instability can also occur due to the

external cavity modes with small mode spacing. The mechanism is that a random intensity

2

ﬂuctuation in each mode will result in mode-dependent random ﬂuctuation in phase shift

[6]. Hence, multimode oscillation and intrinsic mode-partition noise as well as frequency

dependent nonlinear refractive index are the dynamical origins to cause the chaotic bursts

in the presence of ﬁber [6]. Here we report an experimental result of a diode-pumped mi-

crochip Nd:YVO4 (yttrium orthovanadate) solid state laser, in which mode-partition noise

is not essential, but the intrinsic phase ﬂuctuation may be dominant around the onset of

instability. Furthermore, it will be shown that a novel non-stationary characteristic is inher-

ent in the instability due to the strong coupling between two diﬀerent dynamical states at

transition. This non-stationary feature should be unique for the characterization of generic

dynamical systems.

In our experiment, a diode-pumped microchip Nd:YVO4 laser operated at single-mode

regime is employed and a compound cavity is formed with single-mode ﬁber feedback. The

laser diode (LD) and Nd:YVO4 (1mm thick, 1% Nd3+ doped, and the output coupling is

5 ± 2% at 1064nm) are available from CASIX, Inc. The laser crystal (Nd:YVO4) is inserted

into a 2mm-thick copper mount and the temperature is controlled at 25oC by a temperature

controller (ILX, LDT-5910B). The pumping beam (with wavelength at λp=808nm) from

LD, which is also temperature-controlled, is focused onto the laser crystal with a GRIN lens

(0.22 pitch). The pumping threshold is around 300 mA. We also use a noise ﬁlter (ILX

320) to eliminate the pumping noise caused by the LD current driver (ILX, LDC-3744) and

an interference ﬁlter (60% transmission at 1064nm and zero-transmission for the rest) to

reduce the inﬂuence of pumping light on detection.

In the entire pumping domain a π-

polarized TEM00 mode of laser output was observed. We used a 10m single-mode ﬁber (3M

F-SY) as the feedback loop. The feedback beam is monitored and no signiﬁcant polarization

has been found. Because of the reduction of the lasing threshold (about 1-2 mA less) the

feedback strength is estimated to be below 1%. To further control the feedback strength,

before the light entering the ﬁber, a rotatable polarizer (New Focus 5525) is utilized. In the

measurement, a multi-wavelength meter (HP 86120B) is employed to monitor the variation

of lasing mode and the lasing wavelength is 1064.245 nm. The lasing eigenmode frequency

3

of the compound cavity is determined by the frequency arrangement of the Nd:YVO4 laser

cavity mode (mode spacing 0.25 nm; i.e., ∼ 60 GHz) and the external cavity (ﬁber) modes

for which the number of modes is very large (the mode spacing of external cavity is around

10 MHz). We also utilize low-noise detectors (New Focus 1611; bandwidth 1GHz) for the

detection of laser output. Both ac and dc ports of the detectors are connected to a transient

oscilloscope (HP54542C) for data acquisition in the temporal domain. Meanwhile, a rf-

spectrum analyzer (HP8591E) is employed to monitor the behavior of laser output in the

rf-spectrum domain.

For later identiﬁcation, we ﬁrst show the result of a typical ac time series for the case

of free-running and its corresponding rf-spectrum in Fig.1. Relaxation oscillation occurs

around 1.6 MHz and its harmonics can be easily characterized. As the strength of feedback

is increased, chaotic bursting occurs and the dominant frequency was shifted to a lower value

(around 1.0 MHz) with broadened-linewidth. Typical time series of the chaotic bursting is

shown in Fig.2 (a). To explore the dynamics, we employ a joint-time frequency analysis.

The coincidence of frequency characteristics between Fig.1 (b) and Fig.2 (b) suggests that

the low-intensity level part of chaotic bursting, the regime I in Fig.2 (a), is a noise-driven

relaxation oscillation while the high-intensity level part, the regime III in Fig.2 (a), can

be identiﬁed to be chaos based on a singular value decomposition analysis [7]. We noted

that the basic characteristics of the dynamical transition between two states is frequency-

broadening in the rf-spectrum as shown in Fig.2 (c). Nevertheless, the lasing wavelength

remains the same. That is no signiﬁcant line-width broadening or hopping has been seen.

Meanwhile, as instability occurs, the signal-to-noise level of the lasing mode decreases and

features as a fast frequency-modulated (FM) laser characteristics. This suggests that there

is a FM noise in the process of instability.

Next let us address the physical mechanism of coexistence of two dynamical states. As

seen from the time series, the behavior of peak power is a key factor for the dynamics. Since

our system is essentially a single-mode laser with weak feedback, the Lang-Kobayashi model

[2] is still applicable such that the photon density S(t) follows

4

dS(t)
dt

= K[(n(t) − 1)S(t) + ǫn(t)] + 2κ

S(t)S(t − T )cosθ(t),

(1)

p

where K is the time ratio between the population inversion lifetime and the photon lifetime,

n(t) is the population inversion density (or carrier density), ǫ is the spontaneous emission

factor, κ is the feedback coupling strength, T is the delay time, and θ is the phase diﬀerence

between the output and the feedback beams. The peak power Sp, therefore, follows

−Kǫnp(t)

Sp =

K(np(t) − 1) + 2κq1 + ∆S

Sp

cosθp

,

(2)

where ∆S = Sp(t) − Sp(t − T ) and the subscript p denotes the corresponding quantities

evaluated at S = Sp(t). The role of ∆S is crucial. As the feedback coupling κ is almost

zero, the statistics Sp should simply follow the (on-oﬀ) ﬂuctuation of the population inversion

as implied by the lasing threshold factor, n(t)−1. With a nonzero-κ, the dynamics of Sp will

be modiﬁed by the appearance of ∆S as well as the phase term θp. Since the magnitude of

the peak output is directly measurable, a further investigation of the peak photon intensity

and the statistics of time-diﬀerence quantity (∆S) will be fruitful. With oscilloscope, we

repeatedly accumulate the time series of laser output and pick up the discrete peak value

Sp(n), n = 1, 2, ... where n denotes the nth peak. To have a reliable probability, total

320, 000 peaks have been collected for average at any speciﬁc rotation angle of polarizer.

As the polarizer is rotated, the feedback strength will be changed. Asymptotically, as

κ → 0, the system features a free-running laser such that the mean and the standard

deviation are small. However, there is a dramatic increasement in both of the mean and

the standard deviation around 41-42 degree of polarizer’s angle which implies the onset of

transition. To further identify the transition, we evaluate the probability distribution of

peak powers at diﬀerent feedback strength (equivalent to the diﬀerent polarizer’s angle). In

the regime of noise-driven relaxation oscillation, the probability distribution of peak power

P (Sp) follows an exponential law which features a shot-noise characteristics (as shown in

Fig.3 (a)). On the other hand, in the case that chaotic bursting occurred, a tailed probability

distributions will be created. If we pay attention only on the part of large intensity, by which

5

the exponential distribution can be neglected, a Gaussian distribution can be recognized as

feedback strength is further increased as shown in Fig.3 (c). This shows that there are

two dynamical states which follows diﬀerent statistics. Dynamical transition from a simple

exponential distribution to a mixed distribution does occur as shown in Fig.3 (a)-(c).

What is the inﬂuence of the onset of such a mixed distribution? By a joint probability

analysis similar that used in [8], it can be identiﬁed that there is still a strong overlapping

between the two probability distributions. This suggests that the interplay between two

states may be rather unique where the statistics of time-diﬀerence should be crucial also as

discussed above. This also means that we should look at the dynamical behavior of a k-step

diﬀerence quantity,

∆Sp(k) = Sp(k + l) − Sp(l),

where Sp(l) is the lth. peak power. After the summation over the whole range of l, the

probability P (∆Sp(k)) speciﬁes the variation distribution with k-step diﬀerence. Consider

that when the system is with noise-driven relaxation oscillation, the variation distributions

should be the same no matter what is the value of k since the switching characteristic is

stationary. The diﬀerence can be characterized by a χ2 statistics which is deﬁned as

(3)

(4)

χ2(j; k) =

M

X
i

(Ri − Si)2
(Ri + Si)

,

where Ri and Si are the probabilities of the ith interval of ∆Sp for P (∆Sp(k + j)) and

P (∆Sp(k)), respectively. The summation is carried out for all intervals except Ri = Si = 0

[9]. For a ﬁxed j, the χ2(j; k) indicates the similarity of the distribution between the

variations ∆Sp(k) and ∆Sp(k+j). Foremost of all, the most crucial quantity is the successive

change on similarity, i.e., j = 1. A large value in χ2(1; k) means that at time k the dynamics

has been switched to a state which follows a dramatically diﬀerent statistical distribution

and this suggests a strong interplay between states. Furthermore, when the value of χ2(1; k)

is wildly varied as k moved a non-stationary dynamics will be intrinsic in nature. The degree

of non-stationarity of the whole process can be quantiﬁed by an average quantity, i.e.

6

χ2(1) =

χ2(1; k).

In principle, the correlation of variation distributions is essentially stationary as χ2(1) ≈ 0

[9], i.e., there is no dramatic dynamical changes on the correlation of the variation distri-

butions in the range of average. Shortly, one can explore the dynamical characteristics of

switching with this χ2 statistics. Let us next address our experimental results. As shown

in Fig.4 (a) where L = 200, χ2(1)s are almost close to zero for the relaxation oscillation

regime as expected. The interesting point is the appearance of high χ2(1) at the medium

strength of feedback (around 40◦ of polarizer’s angle), which also corresponds to the transi-

tion indicated by the probability distribution, the mean, and the standard deviation. This

shows that the transition is associated with a non-stationary characteristic and, thus, the

successive change on similarity is wild.

It remains a surprise that for a larger feedback

strength (small polarizer’s angle), χ2(1) is still almost zero again. This peculiar feature is

due to the observation that an increase of feedback strength causes an increase of staying

times at particular state and, as a result, the successive change on similarity will become

smooth. In more details, Fig.4 (b) presents the degree of probability association, χ2(1; k).

For some particular feedback strength, χ2(1; k) never keeps near zero, which suggests the

instability has a strong non-stationary switching. On the other hand, in the regime of large

polarizer’s angle (noise-driven relaxation oscillation), the χ2(1; k) is almost zero (Fig.4 (c)).

Here, we would like to emphasize that the transition indicated by a high χ2(1) is crucial and

it reveals a rather amazing characteristics: a weak-feedback induced instability can even be

associated with a wild and non-stationary successive change on the similarity of variation

probability distributions.

Let us discuss the origin of such chaotic bursting and even non-stationary characteristics

in such an instability. Referring to Eq.(1) and Eq.(2), since the dc value of the photon

density S(t) is never zero, the term cosθ(t) sometimes has to be zero such as to terminate

the feedback process. In such a way, the noise-driven relaxation oscillation can be created

with non-zero κ. This means that a ﬁxed phase diﬀerence (θ ≈ π/2) during the period of

7

relaxation oscillation has to be established. Therefore, the persistence in ﬁxed phase diﬀer-

ence is essential for switching back to the relaxation oscillation and should be critical for

the overlapping in joint-probability as well as the non-stationary switching. In other words,

the random phase ﬂuctuation due to the feedback eﬀect is essential for the chaotic burst-

ing behavior. Hence, an inclusion of fast frequency-modulation characteristics (FM noise)

to the phase ﬂuctuation is necessary in the process as experimentally suggested from the

measurement of the multiwavelength meter. Indeed, under this condition, the simulation of

the single-mode Lang-Kobayashi model can reproduce the chaotic bursting features reported

above. Finally, we would like to note that the similar instability has also been observed with

various ﬁber lengths (7m, 5m, 4m, and 3m) as well as multimode ﬁber. Moreover, in stead

of polarizer, a N.D. ﬁlter is also employed and similar results are concluded. The further

details as well as the analysis of χ2(j) with large-j will be reported elsewhere.

Abstract

The experiments with broadband down-converted light clearly show

inequality of forward and reversed processes in optics.

PACS number: 32.80.Qk, 42.50.Dv

The concept of coherency gives good explanation of a light interference phe-
nomenon. This concept is widely used now also for explanation of origin of
majority complex nonlinear eﬀects in optics: coherent population trapping [1],
ampliﬁcation without inversion [2], electromagnetically induced transparency
[3], photon echo and so on. It is supposed, that interaction of coherent laser
radiation with atoms and molecules creates a so-called coherent states, which
have some speciﬁc properties. Some processes of constructive and destructive
interference of such states are also supposed. As a result the discussed above
nonlinear eﬀects become possible.

However, the physical base of such explanation is rather weak. Some theo-
rists argue that the inability to measure the absolute phase of an electromagnetic
ﬁeld prohibits the representation of a lasers output as a quantum optical coher-
ent state [4, 5].
In fact, it means, that using the concept of coherent states
for explanation of nonlinear phenomena does not have physical sense. Such
situation may be more suits for a religion, than for the science [6].

From other side, we have now also the alternative explanation of origin of
nonlinear phenomena in optics [7]. It is based on the concept of inequality of
forward and reversed processes in optics. This concept at once assumes the
existence of a memory of atoms and molecules about the initial state. Such
property looks like very similar to the properties of the coherent states: the
memory must be destroyed in collisions.

The main direct and reliable experimental proof of inequality forward and
reversed processes in optics now is the results of the study of excited states
of polyatomic molecules in a molecular beam [8]. Polyatomic molecules have
in absorption spectrum the so-called wide component of line, which is charac-
terized by unusual combination of properties: the huge homogeneous spectral
width of optical transition is combined with the long lifetime of excited states
[9]. Absorption of photon is a forward process in these experiments. And the
stimulated emission of photons is a reversed process (Fig.1a). The simple pump-
probe experiments give the direct result that the spectral width of the reversed
process in this case is in more than ﬁve orders of magnitude smaller, than the

width of the forward transition. Accordingly, the cross-section of the reversed
process is in several orders of magnitude greater, than for the forward transition.
The goal of this note is to discuss the recent experiments on splitting and
mixing of photons, which also demonstrate inequality of forward and reversed
In the preceding case the memory about the ini-
process in optics [10, 11].
tial state is demonstrated by molecules.
In the discussed cases the photons
demonstrate this property. In these experiments at the ﬁrst step the photons
are splitted in the process of down-conversion of nanosecond laser pulse in two
beams (ωidler and ωsignal) of broadband femtosecond pulses.
In the second
step this photons are mixed (Fig.1b). In one case the mixing is carried out by
sum frequency generation in nonlinear crystal with subsequent study of spectral
characteristics of light [10]. In other case such mixing is carried out as a two-
photon excitation of rubidium atoms in the cell and the eﬃciency of mixing is
controlled by monitoring the ﬂuorescence intensity of excited atoms [11].

Because of the spectral width of the femtosecond down-converted pulses is
very large, the mixing light also may be very wide. In this case the splitting
of photons is a forward process. The mixing of splitted photons is a reversed
process, but only for the case, when ω = ω1. When ω 6= ω1, the mixing of
photons again will be only the forward process. Both experiments give the same
result: the reversed process is much more eﬃcient, than the forward one. The
resulting radiation has the same narrow spectral width as the initial nanosecond
laser pulse. This experiments quit clearly demonstrate, that the forward and
reversed processes in optics are inequivalent.

It will be also interesting to study the opposite case, when the ﬁrst forward
step is a mixing of photons and the second reversed step is a splitting of the
mixed photons.

In conclusion, the concept of inequality of forward and reversed processes,
probably, is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics [12]. This concept
allows giving simple and natural explanation of physical origin of most eﬀects
in nonlinear optics [13].

We suggest a geometrical framework to discuss periodic layered structures in the unit disk. The
band gaps appear when the point representing the system approaches the unit circle. We show that
the trace of the matrix describing the basic period allows for a classiﬁcation in three families of
orbits with quite diﬀerent properties. The laws of convergence of the iterates to the unit circle can
be then considered as universal features of the reﬂection.

Photonic band gap structures [1] can be dealt with by
computing the band structure (using e.g. Bloch theory)
or from the point of view of scattering [2]. The essential
diﬀerence is that a scattering experiment always involves
a ﬁnite structure, while Bloch waves imply an endlessly
repetition of the basic period.

In the context of electromagnetic optics, photonic crys-
tals (that is, one-dimensional periodic layered structures)
have attracted recently a lot of attention because the
striking property of acting as omnidirectional reﬂectors:
they can reﬂect light at any polarization, any incidence
angle, and over a wide range of wavelengths [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
The appearance of strong reﬂection (stop bands) de-
pends on the properties of the basic period. Diﬀerent
theoretical approaches, involving equivalent medium the-
ories, group velocity, and other quantities [8, 9], have
been developed to account for the detailed structure of
these stop bands and their edges. Each one of these mod-
els emphasizes some aspects of the problem but, at the
same time, has some drawbacks.

In the present Letter we introduce a geometrical set-
ting that allows for a deeper understanding of periodic
systems. Our treatment is quite general and only as-
sumes linearity: it applies to any physical system whose
transfer matrix belongs to the group SU(1, 1). The key
point for our purposes is the fact that the multilayer
transfer function induces a bilinear transformation in the
unit disk [10, 11]. Since perfect mirrors are represented
precisely by the unit circle, the route to a stop band can
be understood as the convergence of the point represent-
ing the action of the system to the unit circle.

We start by examining the basic period of the system,
which consists of a stack of plane-parallel layers sand-
wiched between two semi-inﬁnite ambient (a) and sub-
strate (s) media that we shall assume to be identical,
since this is the common experimental case. Hereafter
all the media are supposed to be lossless, homogeneous,
and isotropic.

A monochromatic linearly polarized plane wave falls
from the ambient making an angle θ0 with the normal
to the ﬁrst interface and with an amplitude E(+)
. We
consider as well another plane wave of the same frequency
and polarization, and with amplitude E(−)
, incident from
the substrate at the same angle θ0. The output ﬁelds in
the ambient and the substrate will be denoted E(−)
and
E(+)

Here the complex numbers Ras and Tas are, respec-
tively, the overall reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients
for a wave incident from the ambient. Because |Ras|2 +
|Tas|2 = 1, we have det Mas = +1 and then the set of loss-
less multilayer matrices reduces to the group SU(1, 1).

We are often interested in the transformation proper-
ties of ﬁeld quotients rather than the ﬁelds themselves.
Therefore, we introduce the complex numbers

z =

E(−)
E(+) ,

for both ambient and substrate. Equation (1) deﬁnes
then a transformation on the complex plane C, mapping
the point zs into the point za, according to

za = Φ[Mas, zs] =

β∗ + α∗zs
α + βzs

,

which is a bilinear (or M¨obius) transformation. This ac-
tion can be seen as a function za = f (zs) that will be
called the multilayer transfer function. One can check
that the unit disk, the external region and the unit circle
remain invariant under the multilayer action [10]. Note
that |za| = |zs| = 1 for a perfect mirror with light in-
cident from both the ambient and the substrate, so the
transformation (4) relates then points on the unit cir-
cle. When no light strikes from the substrate zs = 0 and
|za| = 1, so a mirror maps the origin into a point on the
unit circle.

In what follows, the idea of ﬁxed points of the trans-
formation will prove to be essential. These points can be
deﬁned as the ﬁeld conﬁgurations such that za = zs ≡ zf
in Eq. (4); i.e., zf = Φ[Mas, zf ], whose solutions are

The trace of Mas provides then a suitable tool for the
classiﬁcation of multilayers [12].

When [Tr(Mas)]2 < 4 the multilayer action is elliptic
and it has only one ﬁxed point inside the unit disk, while
the other lies outside. When [Tr(Mas)]2 > 4 the action is
hyperbolic and it has two ﬁxed points on the unit circle.
Finally, when [Tr(Mas)]2 = 4 the multilayer action is
parabolic and it has only one (double) ﬁxed point on the
unit circle.

To proceed further let us note that by taking the con-

jugate of Mas with any matrix C ∈ SU(1, 1), that is

that have as ﬁxed points the origin (elliptic), +i and

signiﬁcance has been studied before [15].

The concept of orbit is especially appropriate for ob-
taining a picture of these actions. Given a point z, its
orbit is the set of points z′ obtained from z by the action
of all the elements of the group. In Fig. 1.a we have plot-
ted typical orbits for each one of the canonical forms. For

FIG. 2: Plot of the successive iterates (N = 1, . . . , 5) for an
elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic action starting from the
origin as the initial point. The physical system is described
in the text. Only hyperbolic and parabolic actions tend to
the unit circle.

For an arbitrary matrix Mas the orbits can be obtained
by transforming the orbits described before with the ap-
propriate matrix C . In Fig. 1.b we have plotted typi-
cal examples of such orbits for elliptic, hyperbolic, and
parabolic actions. We stress that once the ﬁxed points of
the matrix Mas are known, one can ensure that za will
lie in the orbit associated to zs.

Assume now that we have a ﬁnite periodic structure
obtained by repeating N times the basic period repre-
sented by Mas. The overall transfer matrix for this sys-
tem is MN
as. In the unit-disk picture, the transformed ﬁeld
by the N -period structure is represented by the point

zN = Φ[Mas, zN −1] = Φ[MN

as, z0],

(8)

where z0 is the initial point zs. The idea that maps
iterates could be applied to this problem was recognized
before, though with a somewhat diﬀerent approach [16,
17].

Henceforth, we shall take z0 = 0, which is not a seri-
ous restriction and corresponds to the case in which no
light incides from the substrate [E(−)
s = 0], as it happens
usually. Note also that all the points zN lie in the or-
bit associated to the initial point z0 by the single period,
which is determined by its ﬁxed points: the character
of these ﬁxed points determine thus the behavior of the
periodic structure.

To illustrate how this geometrical approach works in
practice, we take the single period as a Fabry–Perot-like
system formed by two identical plates separated by a
spacer of phase thickness δ2. This is a symmetric system
for which Ras and Tas can be easily computed [11]. By
varying δ2 we can choose to work in the elliptic, the hy-
perbolic, or the parabolic case. In Fig. 2 we have plotted
the sequence of successive iterates obtained numerically
for these three regimes.

In the elliptic case, it is clear that the points zN revolve
in the orbit centered at the ﬁxed point and the system
never reaches the unit circle.

On the contrary, for the hyperbolic and parabolic cases
the iterates converge to one of the ﬁxed points on the
unit circle, although with diﬀerent laws, which corre-
spond to the band stop and band edges of the system,
respectively [7].

To gain further insights into these behaviors, we com-
pute explicitly the N th iterate. This can be easily done

3

for the canonical forms in Eq. (7) and then, conjugating
as in (6) we obtain, after some lengthy calculations, that
for a hyperbolic action one has

zN =

1 − ξN
1 − ξN (zf +/zf −)

zf +,

where ξ = (α + βzf −)/(α + βzf +) is a complex number
satisfying |ξ| < 1. Analogously, for the parabolic case we
have

then compute that for the hyperbolic case [19]

|zN |2 =

|β|2
|β|2 + [sinh(χ)/ sinh(N χ)]2 ,

(11)

that approaches the unit circle exponentially with N ,
as one could expect from a band stop, while for the
parabolic action

|zN |2 =

|β|2
|β|2 + (1/N )2 ,

(12)

(9)

(10)

zN =

N βz2

N βzf − 1

,

where zf is the (double) ﬁxed point. It is quite obvious
that in both cases zN converges to one of the ﬁxed points
on the unit circle, so |zN | → 1 when N increases, a typical
behavior of perfect mirror. In the mathematical litera-
ture this limit point is referred to as the Denjoy-Wolﬀ
point of the map [18].

To characterize the convergence of zN we note that,
because z0 = zs = 0, this initial point is transformed by
the single period into za = Ras. Therefore, zN represents
the reﬂection coeﬃcient of the overall periodic structure
R(N )
as , which is obviously diﬀerent from (Ras)N . One can

that goes to unity with a typical behavior O(N −2). This
is universal in the physics of reﬂection, as put forward in
a diﬀerent framework by Yeh [20] and Lekner [21].

To conclude, we expect that the geometrical scenario
presented here could provide an appropriate tool for an-
alyzing and classifying the performance of periodic mul-
tilayers in an elegant and concise way that, additionally,
is wider enough to accommodate other periodic systems
appearing in physics.

The connection between the time-dependent physical spectrum of light and the phase space overlap
of Wigner functions is investigated for optical pulses. Time and frequency properties of optical pulses
with chirp are analyzed using the phase space Wigner and Ambiguity distribution functions. It is
shown that optical pulses can exhibit interesting phenomena, very much reminiscent of quantum
mechanical interference, quantum entanglement of wave packets, and quantum sub-Planck structures
of the time and frequency phase space.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In a paper published in 1977, Professor Eberly and one of the present authors (KW), have introduced the time-
dependent physical spectrum of light described by non-stationary random electric ﬁelds [1]. The deﬁnition of such
an operational spectrum required, as an essential step, a frequency tunable ﬁlter, that allows the resolution of the
frequency components.
If one restricts the result of [1] to deterministic ﬁelds only, the time-dependent physical
spectrum takes the following form

where E(t) is the positive frequency part of the detected electric ﬁeld, and the spectral properties of the ﬁlter are
(t; Γ)eiωt. This function depends on the setting frequency ω, and the response
represented by the response function
amplitude is characterized by a bandwidth Γ of the ﬁlter. If one rewrites the time-dependent spectrum formula (1)

and applied to the reconstruction of the amplitude and phase of optical pulses.

Several years after the introduction of the time-dependent spectrum, similar expressions to (1) have been derived

(t) = E(t), the recorded time-dependent spectrum corresponds to the frequency resolved optical gating (FROG)

[3], or to the second harmonic frequency resolved optical gating (SHG FROG) [4]. Methods based on FROG have
become powerful tools in the investigations of femtosecond pulses.

If one selects

The remarkably simple expression (1), hides a very interesting phase space structure of the operational spectrum
in terms of a time and frequency distribution overlap. It has been shown [5], that the time-dependent spectrum can
be visualized as a time and frequency convolution of two Wigner distribution functions

In this expression the ﬁrst Wigner function corresponds to the time and frequency distribution of the ﬁlter, while
the second Wigner function describes the phase space properties of the measured electric ﬁeld. It is perhaps worth
mentioning, that a quantum version of the expression (3), can be applied in quantum mechanics, to describe joint
operational measurements of position and momentum [6].

In order to honor Professor Eberly’s contributions to the development of the time-dependent spectrum and Quantum
Optics, this paper will investigate time and frequency properties of optical pulses using the concept of the phase space
Wigner distribution. We will show that optical pulses can exhibit interesting phase space structures very much
reminiscent of quantum mechanical interference [7], quantum entanglement of wave packets [8], and quantum sub-
Planck structures [9].

This paper is organized in the following way. Section II is devoted to the deﬁnition and elementary properties of
the time and frequency Wigner and Ambiguity distribution functions. Section III contains a detailed description of
chirped pulses using a time and frequency phase space. We show that time and frequency correlations of chirped
pulses have a formal analogy to entanglement of wave packets. The strength of these correlations is investigated using
the Schmidt decomposition. In Section IV we analyze the phase space properties of a linear superposition of two
chirped pulses. In Section V we discuss the connection of sub-Fourier phase space structures with pulse overlaps.
Finally some concluding results are presented.

II. TIME AND FREQUENCY PHASE SPACE

A. The Wigner Function

We shall investigate time and frequency properties of optical pulses using a phase space distribution function. Such
a function has been originally introduced by Wigner in 1932 and applied to quantum mechanics [10]. In the area of
signal processing the same distribution function has been used by Ville in 1948 [11]. The time and frequency Wigner
distribution function corresponding to the ﬁeld envelop E(t) is deﬁned as

It is well known that the Wigner function can be used as a time and frequency distribution of the pulse, but cannot
be guaranteed to be positive for all ﬁelds. There is an extensive literature devoted to the properties and applications
of the Wigner function in quantum mechanics [12] and classical optics [13]. Below we present only the most relevant
properties of the Wigner distribution needed for the purpose of this paper.

The frequency integration of the Wigner function yields the temporal instantaneous intensity

The corresponding time integration of this distribution leads to the power spectrum of the optical pulse

dω WE(t, ω) = I(t) = E∗(t)E(t) .

dt WE(t, ω) = P (ω) =

˜E∗(ω) ˜E(ω) .

see that that the Wigner function is normalized to the total power/energy of the pulse

iωtE(t) is the Fourier transform of the pulse. From these deﬁnitions we

dω WE(t, ω) =

dω P (ω) ,

where the last equality follows from the Parseval theorem for the Fourier transforms. An important result that we
shall use in the following sections is the overlap relation for two Wigner functions

This formula indicates that the case a zero overlap of two pulses is impossible to achieve with positive Wigner functions.
Using the Wigner function as a weighting distribution one can characterize the properties of the optical pulse in

the form of the following statistical moments of time and frequency

A diﬀerent way of looking at the time-frequency correlations (9) is to use the Ambiguity function, which is a

two-dimensional Fourier transform of the Wigner function

C. ABCD optics of optical pulses

It is known from classical optics that for linear optical devices one can use the ABCD transformation of geometrical
ray displacement and slope [14]. We will use this approach to describe arbitrary linear transformations of time and
frequency given by

(cid:18)
This transformation is canonical if it preserves the normalization of the Wigner function

III. TIME AND FREQUENCY DESCRIPTION OF CHIRPED PULSES

A. General properties of chirped pulses

Let us write the electric ﬁeld in the form of a real envelop and phase:

As an example of the general envelop (17), we will consider a single pulse with a linear chirp and Gaussian envelop

function of the form

We have assumed that our pulse is long enough, so one can perform the standard decomposition of the electric ﬁeld
into the slow amplitude (17), and the harmonic carrier with frequency ωl. The intensity and the power spectrum of
this pulse are

(cid:18)

In these formulas the full duration of the pulse is deﬁned as a full width at half maximum of the intensity (FWHM):
τp = 2√2 ln 2 σ, the linear chirp is characterized by a real parameter a, and the electric ﬁeld amplitude has been
conveniently selected to be one in arbitrary units. In all numerical applications in this paper, we select σ2 = 1/2
leading to a pulse duration 2√ln 2. In order to keep our formulas simple we have shifted the frequency ω in such a
way that it incorporates the constant carrier frequency.

The chirp on the pulse (23) corresponds to a linear chirp ˙ϕ(t) = a
a
2σ2 t. For the Gaussian pulse the formula (22) becomes

ω(t) =

−

2σ2 t, leading to the instantaneous pulse frequency

We see that the linear chirp is equivalent to a transformation given by the following ABCD matrix

Note that

From this covariance function we obtain that time and frequency dispersions are

where the lower bound corresponds to Gaussian pulses with no chirp. From these relations we see that the chirp

From the covariance matrix (30) we see that the chirped pulse leads to the following time-frequency correlation

In the next Section we show that the Ambiguity function is particularly useful to quantify the “strength” of this
time-frequency correlation.

C. Schmidt’s decomposition of chirped pulses

We will use the Schmidt decomposition in order to quantify the correlation properties of the chirped pulses. This
decomposition has been successfully used to quantify entanglement of quantum mechanical systems described by a
correlated two-party wave functions. As an example we note that recently Professor Eberly has investigated high
transverse entanglement in optical parametric down conversion using a Schmidt decomposition of the biphoton wave
function [8].

In order to apply the Schmidt decomposition we replace (T, Ω) by two dimensionless variables (X, Y ) such that the

Ambiguity function takes the following form

where

A(X, Y ) = A(0, 0) exp(

where ψn(X) and ψn(Y ) are the Schmidt modes deﬁned as eigenstates of the reduced density operators constructed
from a two-party wave function given by the Ambiguity function (35). The Schmidt eigenvalues pn serve as a degree
of entanglement or correlation between the two-part system. In our case the Schmidt eigenvalues quantify the degree
of correlation between time and frequency. The measure of correlation can be quantiﬁed by entropy of entanglement

For a untangled pulse we have E = 0 because there is only one Schmidt eigenvalue, and the formula (37) factorizes:
A(X, Y ) = A(X)A(Y ).

The Schmidt decomposition can be performed for a Gaussian ambiguity function characterized by an arbitrary

covariance matrix (30). In this case the entropy of entanglement is

Clearly we have E = 0 for uncorrelated in time and frequency optical pulses.

For the Gaussian optical pulse (23) with chirp, we obtain that the Schmidt eigenvalues have the formal form of the

Bose-Einstein distribution

The Schmidt eigenstates corresponds to a thermal distribution with a mean number of photons given by ¯n. Using
this expression we calculate the entropy of entanglement (39)

FIG. 3: Entropy of the pulse as a function of the chirp a

We conclude this section with a remark that pulses with linear chirp are analogous to quantum mechanical wave
functions of the form ψ(x) = eiax2
. In the framework of quantum mechanics such wave functions belong to a wide
class of the so-called contractive states [15], and have been used to show the narrowing of the position uncertainty
relation [16], and applied by Professor Eberly to phase entanglement [17]. The contractive nature of the chirped pulse
can be easily exhibited using an lens type ABCD transformation of the chirped pulse, equivalent to the following
linear transformation in time and frequency plane

For a chirped pulse the dispersion of this observable is

ωt = ω +

For positive a, this formula exhibits a contraction of the uncertainty of ωt similar to the narrowing of a freely evolving
quantum mechanical wave packets. The narrowing is entirely due to the time-frequency correlation of the chirped
pulse (34).

D. Time dependent spectrum for chirped pulses

In order to calculate the time-dependent spectrum for the chirped pulse, we will use for the ﬁlter response

This function corresponds to a linear, causal and time translation invariant response of the ﬁlter. In the calculations
we will assume that the observation time is larger compared with the pulse duration: t
τd. Simple calculation shows
that the spectrum is Gaussian and has the form

where v = (t, ω) is a vector and the matrix G can be expressed in terms of the covariance matrices of the pulse and

IV. LINEAR SUPERPOSITION OF CHIRPED PULSES

Linear superposition principle play a fundamental role in classical and quantum interference phenomena. In order

to illustrate time and frequency interference we shall investigate a linear superposition of two optical pulses

where 2t0 is a temporal separation between the pulses. This linear superposition of two electric ﬁelds of optical pulses
exhibit classical interference very similar to the interference of quantum coherent states [18, 19].

As an example of such a superposition we take two Gaussian chirped pulses

In this formula the Wigner function: WE(t, ω) is given by (27). From the Wigner function of the superposition it is
possible to calculate time and frequency moments. Simple calculation leads to

From this formula we see that the spectrum of the linear superposition is reduced (squeezed) below the single pulse
width. This eﬀect is entirely due to the fact that we are dealing with a linear superposition of pulses. In Figures (4)
and (5) we have depicted the Wigner function for the linear superposition with t0 = 4 with no chirp and chirp a = 3.
The squeezing eﬀect corresponding to the nonzero chirp is clearly seen.

Note that in reference [20], the Wigner function of a coherent two-pulse sequence with linear frequency chirp has

been reconstructed experimentally using quantum tomography.

1/√2 and ∆t

The remarkable feature of the Wigner function (52) is the fact that it contains structures in a phase space region
below the Fourier uncertainty relation. In Figure (6) we have depicted the Wigner function in a space region with
1/√2. In the framework of quantum mechanics it has been recognized that small structures
∆ω
on the sub-Planck scale do show up in quantum linear superpositions [9]. It is clear that for linear superpositions of
chirped pulses such sub-Fourier structures emerge as well. We will see in the next Section, that due to such small
structures it will be possible to have pulses with zero overlap.

Such an overlap can be easily obtained if one of the two pulses has its carrier frequency detuned by ∆. In this case
the FROG signal is a phase space overlap (8) of the form

For the chirped pulses this overlap can be calculated, and as a result we obtain

The remarkable feature of this curve is that GF ROG(0, ∆) can vanish for values of ∆ smaller then the frequency
uncertainty in frequency. In terms of the time and frequency distribution function, the detuning ∆ of the carrier
frequency corresponds just to a shift of the Wigner function along the ω axis. In the case of the superposition of two
Gaussian pulses, this shift aﬀects the Gaussian peaks and the oscillating non-positive interference term. It is easy to
notice that for an appropriate value of ∆ this can result in a sign change of the interference term in comparison to the
original function. Calculating the overlap (56) we need a product of shifted and unshifted Wigner functions. For a

selected value of the shift ∆, the product of the two interference terms of their Wigner functions will become negative
(or zero). In Figure (8) we have depicted such a product with t0 = 4 and shift ∆ = π/2t0. We see that the considerably
large negative contribution can cancel the positive peaks corresponding to the overlap of the non-interference terms.
Obviously, formula (57) can be easily obtained without using the Wigner function, but the phase-space representation
(56) is especially useful to show that the sub-Fourier structures are peculiar to interference phenomena.

In quantum mechanical framework this feature is especially interesting as the zero–overlap means that the corre-
sponding states are orthogonal, and so at a sub-Planck scale one can obtain sets of mutually orthogonal states [9]. In
the case of optical pulses we can obtain a similar result of pulses with zero–overlap using a shifts of frequency that are
below the Fourier uncertainty relation. Certainly, the smaller is the value of this shift ∆ that one wants to use, the
larger t0 has to be taken in the calculations, meaning that the Fourier/Heisenberg uncertainty relation is satisﬁed.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have analyzed the connection of the time and frequency time-dependent spectrum with phase space
distributions based on the Wigner and the Ambiguity functions. We have exploited the similarities between optical
pulses and quantum mechanical wave packets to exhibit interference, entanglement, and sub-Fourier structures of the
time and frequency phase space.

Certainly the Wigner function is not the only possible way to give a time and frequency description of optical
pulses. Recently in reference [21] we have introduced a class of new phase space representations based on the so called
Kirkwood–Rihaczek distribution function [13]:

K(t, ω) =

Such phase space distributions provide time and frequency characteristics of optical pulses, but only phase space
overlaps of these distributions have an operational meaning as a physical spectrum of light.
In the case of the
Kirkwood–Rihaczek function this overlap, much resembling the equation (8), is given by the following formula

Thus, for the superpositions discussed in Section V, we can write the following formula

We conclude this paper by noting that the deﬁnition of the time-dependent spectrum of light introduced 28 years ago,
is still an attractive ﬁeld of research producing interesting insights into the deﬁnition of the spectrum of nonstationary
ensemble of optical pulses [22].

the time-dependent spectrum and to the broad ﬁeld of Quantum Optics. This work was partially supported by the

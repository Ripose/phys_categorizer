waveguides

We report on systematic experimental mapping of the transmission properties of two-dimensional
silicon-on-insulator photonic crystal waveguides for a broad range of hole radii, slab thicknesses
and waveguide lengths for both TE and TM polarizations. Detailed analysis of numerous spectral
features allows a direct comparison of experimental data with 3D plane wave and ﬁnite-diﬀerence
time-domain calculations. We ﬁnd, counter-intuitively, that the bandwidth for low-loss propagation
completely vanishes for structural parameters where the photonic band gap is maximized. Our re-
sults demonstrate that, in order to maximize the bandwidth of low-loss waveguiding, the hole radius
must be signiﬁcantly reduced. While the photonic band gap considerably narrows, the bandwidth of
low-loss propagation in PhC waveguides is increased up to 125nm with losses as low as 8±2dB/cm.

I. INTRODUCTION

Two-dimensional photonic crystals (PhC) have gained
considerable interest and are regarded as a promising
platform for dense integration of planar photonic inte-
grated circuits on a chip-scale level [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. In particular, PhCs
fabricated on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) provide waveg-
uide cross-sectional areas on the sub-micron scale while
maintaining single-mode operation due to high refractive
index contrast [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. It has
been shown that for triangular lattice membrane-type
PhCs [15, 16, 17], consisting of a periodic array of holes
with a silicon slab thickness h around 0.5a and hole radii
of ∼ 0.35a (a is the lattice constant) the bandwidth of the
photonic band gap (PBG) can extend over most of the
1.3 and 1.5µm telecommunications transmission bands.
Single-mode waveguiding can be realized by removing a
single row of holes in the periodic photonic lattice along
the Γ-K direction [16, 17]. Mode conﬁnement within the
silicon slab in the vertical direction is accomplished by
index guiding, while lateral conﬁnement within the slab
plane is deﬁned by the PBG [18]. This hybrid conﬁne-
ment limits the bandwidth for intrinsically loss-less prop-
agation to frequencies that are below the light line cut-
oﬀ. Above the light line cutoﬀ the propagation becomes
lossy with mode-leakage out of the slab [6, 10]. Conse-
quently, the bandwidth for intrinsically low-loss propaga-
tion (LLP) of the waveguiding mode is restricted to only
a fraction of the PBG, e.g.
in the order of only a few
tens of nanometers [7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14]. These insights
and many other theoretical investigations of light con-
ﬁnement in planar PhCs and PhC waveguides have been
examined in detail and are well understood. In contrast,
experimental studies of the waveguiding properties of the
slab-type PhC waveguides have been hindered for a long
time by diﬃculties in fabricating these structures. One

of the major challenges in the last decade was to over-
come extremely high transmission losses due to surface
roughness, structural irregularities and ineﬃcient cou-
pling, which signiﬁcantly complicated the interpretation
of experimental results. Recent achievements in opti-
mizing the light coupling eﬃciency into the PhC as well
as fabrication improvements reducing surface roughness
have led to ultra low-loss PhC waveguides thus enabling
further spectroscopic exploration [10, 11, 13, 14].

In this paper, we present detailed and comprehen-
sive experimental studies of the transmission properties
of TE-like (even parity with respect to the slab plane)
and TM-like (odd parity with respect to the slab plane)
modes of two-dimensional membrane-type PhC waveg-
uides. The spectral properties are measured as a function
of various lattice parameters such as hole radius r, slab
thickness h, and the crystal length l. A survey of the ap-
plied experimental techniques, fabrications methods and
theoretical calculations is given in Sec. II. In Sec. III we
explore the transmission properties of the PhC waveg-
uides with structural parameters optimized for a maxi-
mum bandgap. We show that for large hole radii of r/a
∼ 0.38 the bandwidth for LLP completely disappears due
to eﬀective interaction with the band edge slab modes of
the PhC. The transmission properties of PhC waveguides
with small hole radii spanning from r/a=0.22-0.34 are in-
vestigated in Sec. IV. We ﬁnd, counter intuitively, that
in order to maximize the bandwidth of the waveguiding
mode the hole radius needs to be reduced to r/a ∼ 0.2.
Although this optimization is accompanied by a signif-
icant decrease of the PBG, the bandwidth for propaga-
tion is increased up to 125nm, maintaining a reasonable
trade-oﬀ between bandgap and propagation bandwidth.
The experimental ﬁndings are compared to 3D planewave
calculations using the MIT Photonic Band code [19] and
3D-Finite Diﬀerence Time Domain (FDTD) [20]. For the
propagation bandwidth-optimized parameters, we deter-

mine losses as small as 8±2dB/cm, which is one of the
lowest reported to date. Sec. V. will deal with exper-
imental results of transmission spectra in TM polariza-
tion. After their comparison with photonic band struc-
tures, in Sec. VI we will address the observed coupling
of even TE- with odd TE- and TM-like modes. Results
are summarized in Sec. VII.

II. EXPERIMENTAL

Devices were fabricated on lightly p-doped 200mm
silicon-on-insulator SOI wafers from SOITEC [24] with
a Si device layer thickness h of 220nm on top of a 2µm
buried oxide layer (BOX). The processing is performed on
a standard CMOS fab line at the IBM Watson Research
Center as described elsewhere [10, 11]. A 50nm thick ox-
ide is deposited via chemical vapor deposition to serve
as a hard mask for etching. The wafers are patterned by
electron beam lithography (LEICA-VB6, 100keV, single
writing ﬁeld 400µm). The oxide hard mask is opened
and the silicon device layer dry is etched CF4/CHF3/Ar
and HBr chemistry, respectively. After structure def-
inition the BOX layer is selectively under-etched in a
buﬀered HF to form suspended membranes. PhC waveg-
uides are deﬁned by omitting one row of holes from the
PhC lattice in the Γ − K direction (W1-type waveguide).
The light is coupled to the PhC waveguide via a butt-
coupled single-mode strip waveguide. After deﬁnition of
the PhC membrane the polymer inverted spot-size con-
verters are fabricated to achieve high coupling eﬃciency
as reported elsewhere [10, 11]. Three diﬀerent wafers
with slightly diﬀerent slab thicknesses h were processed
with PhC waveguides having nominally the same lat-
tice constant a=437.5nm, but diﬀerent hole radii r=96,
140 and 165nm (r/a=0.22, 0.32, and 0.35, respectively).
The PhC waveguide length is varied in each writing ﬁeld
from 29µm to 2000µm for accurate loss determination.
Four of such ﬁelds grouped together constitute one ex-
perimental chip with the e-beam exposure dose inten-
tionally varied between each ﬁeld. This allows the phase
space of explored lattice parameters to be further broad-
ened. In addition, proximity eﬀects due to background
electron beam scattering induce further minor changes
in the hole diameter between the diﬀerent PhC waveg-
uides even within one ﬁeld. Such variation allows the
exploration of a quasi-continuous range of diﬀerent lat-
tice parameters, but at the same time requires thorough
statistical analysis of the particular PhC waveguide on a
given chip.

The lattice constant a, Si slab thickness h, and the
hole radii r on a given sample are determined by sta-
tistical evaluation of a number of SEM images obtained
on a LEO SEM1560 model with identical imaging con-
ditions (acceleration voltage, focal distance, magniﬁca-
tion, column and aperture alignment, etc). Over 110

2

PhC waveguides were characterized in total. The lattice
constant was measured four times for each PhC waveg-
uide (total number of measurements N =440) yielding an
overall value of a=437.6nm with a standard deviation of
only σ=0.93nm.

In order to check the variation of the hole radius
along a single PhC waveguide N =60 holes were measured
at three diﬀerent locations along the longest 2000µm-
long waveguide separated by approximately 600µm. The
results yield statistically identical mean hole radii of
99.21nm at one end of the PhC waveguide, 99.18nm in
the middle section, and 98.17nm at the other end with
standard deviations not exceeding 1.2nm. The overall
mean hole radius for the total of N =180 measurements
was found to be 98.9nm with σ=1.12nm. For all other
PhC waveguides the hole radius was measured only six
times in their middle section. Although this small num-
ber imposes a less accurate estimation of the mean value,
however from the of N =180 measurements the resulting
standard error does not exceed 0.5% for N =6. The slab
thickness h of the wafers was measured at nine diﬀerent
positions along each sample. For the three processed SOI
wafers with devices having r/a=0.22, 0.32 and 0.35 the
normalized thickness of the Si slab was measured to be
h/a=0.518, 0.507 and 0.546 respectively.

Measurements of transmission spectra of PhC waveg-
uides are performed using a broadband (1200-1700nm)
LED source and an optical spectrum analyzer (OSA)
with 5nm spectral resolution. A rejection ratio of over 30
dB between TE and TM polarizations is achieved with
the use of polarization maintaining, tapered and lensed
ﬁbers and a polarization controller. The transmission
spectra of the PhC waveguides are normalized to the
transmission spectra of a corresponding single-mode ref-
erence strip waveguides located in the same writing ﬁeld
near the PhC structures as described elsewhere [10, 11].
The experimental results are compared with 3D plane
wave calculations performed using the MIT Photonic-
Band code [19]. The dielectric permittivity εSi of the
Si slab and εSiO2 of the oxide layer are taken as 12.1
and 2.0, respectively. Values for the hole radii and lat-
tice constant are chosen as determined by SEM measure-
ments. The grid resolution (number of vectors in the unit
cell of the PhC) of the plane wave calculations is set to
16x16x16, which gives an error in the eigenvalue conver-
gence below ∼ 2% with reasonable calculation time [19].
However, the limited resolution imposes a drawback that
very small changes in the slab thickness h are not well
resolved especially for the TE-like modes resulting in a
step-like rather than a smooth dependence of the calcu-
lated band structures on h. To overcome this issue, the
photonic crystal band structures for slab thicknesses with
h/a=0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 are calculated and intermedi-
ate values are interpolated. Interestingly, to achieve the
best agreement between experiment and theory all slab
thicknesses needed to be assumed 5-10% thinner than

measured by SEM. This discrepancy is consistent with a
small, but noticeable thinning of the silicon slab in the
membrane region during the BOX etch.

All calculations of transmission spectra are performed
with a 3D ﬁnite diﬀerence time domain method (3D
FDTD) using the Fullwave software package [20]. Trans-
mission through a 33 unit cell long PhC W1 waveguide
with 13 rows of holes on each side is calculated with a
265x243x551 mesh (20nm grid size) for over 250000 time
steps.

 

 

 

Historically most eﬀorts on both three-dimensional and
two-dimensional PhCs, were focused on maximizing the
bandwidth of the PBG [15]. A large variety of diﬀer-
ent hole shapes and crystal symmetries were explored
in a planar 2D geometry.
It was shown [15] that for
a 2D PhCs a triangular lattice of air holes (hexago-
nal ﬁrst Brillouin zone), produces the widest PBG for
a slab thickness of ∼ 0.5a and hole radii of ∼ 0.35a.
Waveguiding can then be provided by omitting a row of
holes or increasing the hole radius in the channel. It is
known however, that the resulting mode suﬀers from light
leakage out of the plane for frequencies above the light
line. Leakage losses were measured [6, 10] to be as high
as 1500dB/cm, which prohibits utilization of this wave-
length range for useful waveguiding. These inevitable
diﬀraction losses limit the bandwidth for intrinsic low-
loss propagation (LLP) below the light line to only a
fraction of the PBG [7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14]. Sec. III will
ﬁrst report on the transmission properties of triangular
2D PhC waveguides as a function of the hole radius that
are chosen to match the conditions for an optimized PBG
(r/a=0.348-0.384).

Figure 1 shows a series of transmission spectra of PhC
waveguides of identical length (29µm), but diﬀerent hole
radii and compares them with photonic band structure
calculations. A number of spectral features of the TE-like
modes can be directly mapped to the band diagram. Fig-
ure 1a presents the photonic band structure for the PhC
waveguide with the smallest radius of r/a=0.348. The
onset of the waveguiding mode at wavelengths around
1550nm, also known as the mode gap cutoﬀ [7, 8], is
clearly seen. In the corresponding measured spectrum,
this onset results in a sharp transmission cutoﬀ around
1535nm (Fig.1b, upper curve). The bandwidth for in-
trinsic LLP is strictly bounded by this and the cross-
ing of the waveguide mode with the light line. Calcu-
lations show the light line cutoﬀ is at ∼ 1510nm (nor-
malized frequency of 0.29c/a). Since the length of the
PhC waveguide is only 60 unit cells, the light line cut-
oﬀ manifests itself as only a weak kink at ∼ 1505nm
in the experimental spectra. The LLP bandwidth can
be determined to be ∼ 30nm. At longer wavelengths,
small resonances are present in the measured transmis-
sion spectrum. According to the photonic band struc-
ture, these resonances are identiﬁed as a series of slab
modes below the lower photonic band edge (LBE). These
modes are delocalized over the whole slab with their ﬁelds
mainly concentrated in the dielectric material (dielectric
bands) [15, 16]. At shorter wavelengths, around 1230nm,
the transmission reveals a distinct stop band. This stop
band opens due to the folding of the waveguiding mode
at the edge of the Brillouin zone at k=0. The upper band
edge (UBE), which is deﬁned by the commencement of

slab modes that are predominately located in the holes
(air bands) [15, 16], are not observed in the current set of
spectra since it lies at 1110nm (0.40c/a), as determined
by band structure calculations.

The series of transmission spectra in Fig. 1b shows that
as the hole radius increases, all characteristic spectral
features of the PhC waveguide undergo a shift to higher
energies and is conﬁrmed by the photonic band structure
in Fig. 1c (r/a=0.379). This fact can be easily explained
by a decrease of the eﬀective refractive index of the slab.
However, in addition, the spectral shape of the transmis-
sion in the region of LLP changes drastically. For the
smallest hole radius the LLP transmission region is char-
acterized with a nearly ﬂat top proﬁle. The propagation
losses for waveguides with approximately the same radius
were measured before as small as 24±3dB/cm. In con-
trast, for PhC waveguides with larger hole radii, ﬁrst, the
ﬂat top proﬁle in the vicinity of the mode onset gradually
narrows and then completely disappears for r/a=0.379,
second, propagation losses in this region can be estimated
to be as high as 70dB/cm indicating the complete van-
ishing of the LLP for PhC waveguides for large hole radii.
Interestingly, by analyzing Fig. 1, it can be seen that
with increasing hole radius the blueshift of the transmis-
sion cutoﬀ is far more pronounced than the correspond-
ing blueshift of the stop band. This is surprising since
both stem from the same waveguiding mode. To clarify
this issue the experimental results over a large number
of PhC waveguides with diﬀerent hole radii are summa-
rized in Fig. 2. The spectral positions of waveguiding
mode onset, stop band, light line cutoﬀ and onset of the
LBE slab modes are plotted against normalized hole radii
(measured using a SEM on the very same waveguides).
For this particular range of hole radii the spectral po-
sition of the light line is nearly constant. Since both,
the mode onset and the stop band are deﬁned by the
same PhC waveguiding mode, a change in radius should
lead to a parallel wavelength shift. The experimental re-
sults for r/a<0.37 conﬁrm this behavior.
In addition,
the bandwidth for LLP continuously shrinks with in-
creasing the hole radius. On the other hand, the LBE
exhibits a much steeper spectral shift since the corre-
sponding modes are delocalized over the whole slab, thus
being easily aﬀected by even small changes in the hole
radius. The PhC waveguiding mode instead is mainly
localized in the center of the waveguide and is less in-
ﬂuenced by the surrounding holes. As a result, for hole
radii with r/a>0.37 the experimental transmission cutoﬀ
is no longer deﬁned by the waveguiding mode onset, but
rather by the onset of the slab modes at the LBE. This
causes the LLP bandwidth to completely vanish for large
hole radii.

This experimental observation is conﬁrmed by pho-
tonic band structure calculations in Fig. 1a and Fig. 1c.
While for r/a=0.348 the waveguiding onset and the LBE
are clearly spectrally separated, for r/a=0.379 the LBE

overlaps with the waveguiding mode. Thus, light from
the access strip waveguide can couple not only eﬀectively
to the PhC waveguiding mode, but also to the slab modes
and hence leaks into the slab. This explains the dramatic
increase of the propagation losses. For PhC waveguides
with r/a>0.37,
it leads to a zero-bandwidth for low-
loss propagation. The results presented in this section
demonstrate that with structural parameters, chosen to
maximize the PBG, the bandwidth for LLP ﬁnally van-
ishes.

IV. PHC WAVEGUIDES WITH MAXIMIZED
LOW LOSS PROPAGATION BAND (TE-LIKE
MODES)

Instead of optimizing the bandwidth of the PBG (a pa-
rameter rather irrelevant for the implementation of PhC
waveguides in integrated optics), it is more meaningful to
optimize the bandwidth of LLP. From the analysis of the
previous results in Sec. III we can conclude that smaller
hole radii are required for the optimization of the LLP
bandwidth. In Fig. 2 we have seen that for a decrease
of the hole radius of only ∼ 5% (r/a=0.365→0.348) the
LLP bandwidth signiﬁcantly broadens by more than a
factor of two (13→30nm). To conﬁrm this trend, this sec-
tion will ﬁrst deal with PhC waveguides of only slightly
smaller hole radii (r/a=0.32-0.34).
In the second part
we will then proceed to investigate PhC waveguides with
very small holes (r/a=0.22-0.24).

∼ 0.34 and b) r/a ∼ 0.23. The transmission dip marked with
an asterisk corresponds to the x-odd TE-like mode (see text
for details).

proximately the same hole radius (r/a∼0.34) are shown
in Fig. 3a. In the same manner as done in Fig. 1, the
comparison of transmission spectra with photonic band
structure calculations (not shown) enables the identiﬁca-
tion of the spectral features of the PhC waveguides. For
the waveguide length of 29µm (upper curve), the LBE is
clearly visible in the long wavelength region at 1560nm.
The sharp transmission cut oﬀ, located at 1515nm corre-
sponds to the waveguiding onset and the light line cutoﬀ
is seen at 1480nm. At shorter wavelengths, the trans-

fact, the spectra look very similar to the results of Fig.
1b, however the PBG bandwidth is signiﬁcantly reduced
by 25nm, while the bandwidth for LLP increases up to
35nm. The results of Fig. 3a can be used to determine the
propagation losses in the LLP region. Losses at 1500nm
are calculated to be 20±3dB/cm; the method is described
later in this section (see also Ref.10).

Since the expansion of the bandwidth for LLP simulta-
neously takes place with a shrinking of the PBG, one can
conclude that there must be a lower limit for the radius
where the LLP bandwidth would be restricted by the slab
modes of the UBE. To ﬁnd the upper limit of the LLP
bandwidth, PhC waveguides with signiﬁcantly reduced
hole radii need to be investigated. Fig. 3b shows the ex-
perimental results of a series of transmission spectra of
PhC waveguides with diﬀerent lengths but again nearly
the same hole radii (r/a∼0.23). Compared to Fig. 3a, the
size of the hole radius is reduced by over 30% and causes
a drastic change in the transmission spectra. Within the
measured spectral range, no LBE is detected, since it has
redshifted to 1730nm. Furthermore, the stop band has
also disappeared from the spectra. On the very edge of
the transmission spectra, around 1695nm, a sharp trans-
mission cut oﬀ is present, and for shorter wavelengths is
followed by a region of ﬂat transmission and relatively
low losses. At wavelengths shorter than 1550nm, the
transmission spectra are now dominated by very strong
resonances covering a broad bandwidth.

To understand the origin of these resonances and to
interpret the experimental transmission spectra, Fig. 4a
compares the transmission spectrum of a 29µm PhC
waveguide with r/a=0.22 against 3D FDTD calculations.
For calculations the thickness of the slab was deﬁned as
h/a=0.52. The FDTD calculated spectrum is in good
agreement with the experimental transmission spectrum.
The diﬀerence in amplitude is due to the shorter waveg-
uide length used in the calculations (33 unit cells or
14.4µm). The comparison of calculated and experimen-
tal transmission spectra allows identiﬁcation of the mea-
sured transmission cutoﬀ around 1700nm as the onset
of the waveguiding mode, The onset is followed by nu-
merous resonances starting at 1725nm. In direct analogy
with the interpretation of the experimental results shown
in Fig. 1b and Fig. 3a, these resonances can be attributed
to modes below the LBE.

The calculated transmission also conﬁrms the pres-
ence of additional resonances between 1200 and 1500nm.
However, from the FDTD spectrum alone it is not pos-
sible to assign their origin. To address this issue Fig. 4b
presents photonic band structure calculation consistent
with the structural input parameters in Fig. 4a. The
strong resonances clearly match with slab modes whose
spectral onset deﬁnes the UBE. The UBE, not visible in
the previous spectra of Fig1b and Fig3a for large hole
radii, has now redshifted over 400nm, almost spectrally
matching the position of the light line cutoﬀ. This huge
spectral shift of the UBE is far more pronounced than
the shift of the LBE. As mentioned before, UBE (air)-
modes are mainly located in the holes of the PhC and
thus exhibit a strong dependence on hole radius. In the
experimental transmission spectrum of Fig. 4a, a kink
around 1570nm indicates where the waveguiding mode
crosses the light line. This becomes more visible for

now close to 130nm, an increase of nearly 300%. This
very broad bandwidth is conﬁrmed by comparison with
the corresponding photonic band structure in Fig. 4b.

Losses within the LLP band are determined from
transmission spectra of PhC waveguides with diﬀerent
length. The inset in Fig. 4a presents the absolute trans-
mission values measured at 1650nm. The slope of the
transmission attenuation gives 3±2dB/cm. Note that
this number corresponds to the total transmission losses
through the PhC waveguide and access strip waveguides,
rather than characterizing the losses in the PhC waveg-
uide alone. While the length of the PhC waveguides
and their corresponding losses is increasing, at the same
time the length of the strip waveguides is shortened to
keep the total length of the photonic circuit on a chip
constant at 4.6mm. Correspondingly, as it was pointed

out in Ref.10, for a correct determination of propagation
losses in the PhC waveguide it is necessary to account for
losses in the bare strip waveguide. Losses from TE-like
modes in analogous strip waveguides with a 460x220nm
cross-section have been determined recently as 3.6dB/cm
and 5dB/cm at 1500nm and 1650nm respectively, as
reported elsewhere [21]. Correspondingly, the eﬀective
loss of the PhC waveguide alone at 1650nm can be es-
timated as 8±2dB/cm. To our knowledge, this is one
of the lowest loss numbers reported for SOI PhC waveg-
uides. There is a remarkable dependence on the hole
radius. Losses decrease from 24±3dB/cm for r/a=0.365
(Ref.10) to 20±3dB/cm for r/a=0.34 and to 8±2dB/cm
for r/a=0.23.
It can be argued that the surface area
of the holes is signiﬁcantly decreased in the waveguides
with smaller radii, thus scattering losses due to sidewall
roughness are becoming less pronounced.
In addition,
the eﬀective waveguide width increases with decreasing
hole radius which can further reduce losses.

Figure 5 summarizes the experimental results of the
PhC waveguides for all measured hole radii. The spec-
tral positions of the TE spectra such as stop band, UBE,
LBE, light line and waveguiding onset are shown as a
function of the normalized hole radius (open shapes cor-
respond to data from Fig. 2). The experimental results
are compared to 3D planewave calculations (solid line)

for the slab thickness of h taken as 0.473a. This corre-
sponds to the hole size series ranging from r/a=0.32-0.34.
Good agreement is found overall between experiment and
calculation. The results in Fig. 5 clearly demonstrate the
broadening of the bandwidth for LLP, which is accom-
panied by a simultaneous shrinkage of the PBG with de-
creasing hole radii. A closer look shows that the set of
data points for the three diﬀerent size series have a minor
spectral displacement with respect to each other. This
step-like behavior can be explained by the diﬀerent slab
thicknesses h of the SOI wafers as measured with a SEM
(see Sec. II).

As can be seen from the planewave calculations in Fig.
5, the maximum LLP with over 150nm bandwidth is
achieved for hole radii r/a=0.207. Here the PBG band-
width is reduced to 160nm, however the LLP region oc-
cupies nearly 94% of the bandwidth. Apparently, further
decrease of the radii would shrink the LLP bandwidth
again, as the slab modes of the UBE would merge into
the LLP.

V. TRANSMISSION OF THE TM-LIKE MODES
IN PHC WAVEGUIDES

It is well known that a PBG for the TM-like modes
does not exist for SOI PhC slabs [15]. However, it is
important to characterize the transmission characteris-
tics of PhC waveguides for TM-mode as well. Firstly,
measurements of TE- and TM-like modes provide good
veriﬁcation and validation of theoretical ﬁtting. With
a set of only three ﬁtting parameters (hole radius, re-
fractive index and slab thickness) all spectral features
found in both, TE- and TM-spectra, have to simultane-
ously match the band structure calculations. Secondly,
and more importantly, due to possible imperfections and
errors in the experimental structures, TM-like modes in
principle may interact with the TE-like modes of interest
and cause additional propagation losses [11].

Measured transmission spectra of TM-like modes are
shown in Fig. 6a. The hole radius of the PhC waveg-
uides is r/a∼0.33. The length of the diﬀerent photonic
crystals range from 29 to 700µm. All transmission spec-
tra exhibit a strong dip at around 1325nm, as well as
multiple strong resonances starting at 1280nm and ex-
tending up to the transmission cutoﬀ at 1235nm. As
before, 3D plane wave calculations of the photonic band
structure are helpful in interpretation of the spectral fea-
tures (Fig. 6b). A dotted line indicates the fundamental
TM-like waveguiding mode. Both in- and out-of-plane
conﬁnement of the mode is purely index guided, hence
showing a nearly linear dispersion. However, the mode
is still strongly conﬁned in the PhC waveguide and pro-
vides most of the transmission. The dip at 1325nm can
be identiﬁed as a stop band that arises from the fold-
ing of the fundamental mode at the edge of the Bril-

louin zone. This fundamental mode is crossing the light
line at around 0.355c/a, which explains the appearance
of the cutoﬀ at 1235nm. Multiple resonances between
1280nm and 1235nm are arising from the coupling of the
fundamental mode with numerous slab modes. Such be-
havior is very analogous to the mode mixing mechanism
observed recently in SOI double-trench waveguides [11].
The spectral region between the stop band at 1325nm
and the onset of the resonances at 1280nm is character-
ized by relatively low-loss propagation. Measurements at
1300nm indicate losses are as small as 16±3dB/cm.

The results of the analyzed TM transmission spectra
for hole radii from r/a=0.32-0.38 are summarized in Fig.
7. The solid lines are the result of photonic band struc-
ture calculations. For the two size series, a slab thickness
of h/a=0.473 or 0.515 was chosen as an input parameter.
These are the same values as for the corresponding TE-
like photonic band structures in Fig. 6 and Fig. 1, respec-
tively. The calculations are in good agreement with the
experimental results. The inset of Fig. 7 shows the TM
spectra of two waveguides, identical in length (29µm),
but diﬀerent hole radii (0.348a and 0.371a). The shift of
the transmission spectra for diﬀerently chosen hole radii
is clearly visible. However, comparison with the corre-

identical in length (29/mum), but with diﬀerent hole radii
(0.348a and 0.371a). The transmission dips marked with an
asterisk correspond to the x-odd TE-like mode (see text for
details).

sponding TE spectra of the identical waveguides (see Fig.
1b) shows that the TM modes exhibit a less pronounced
dependence on the hole radius. In contrast to this, com-
paring the map of TM-like modes in Fig. 7 to the map
of TE-like modes in Fig. 5, the spectral shift between
the series of diﬀerent SOI wafers is far more pronounced.
Such behavior is not unexpected since TM-like modes are
polarized perpendicular to the slab plane and are there-
fore strongly inﬂuenced by a change in the slab thickness
and less by the hole radius.

VI. COUPLING BETWEEN EVEN AND ODD
MODES

In principle, a W1 SOI waveguide is not single-moded
over the entire bandwidth of the PBG. It is known that it
can support two TE-like modes (both even with respect
to the xy-plane in the slab) possessing diﬀerent symme-
tries with respect to the zx-plane vertically bisecting the
slab along the waveguide direction (x-axis). All results
presented so far correspond to the in-plane x-even TE-
like mode. This mode is of most interest for integrated
photonics [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. The TE-like

8

mode with odd zx-symmetry is visible in all band struc-
ture calculations (e.g. Fig. 1a at c/a=0.31). However,
the excitation of this x-odd TE-like mode with the x-
even TE mode in the access strip waveguide is prohibited
due to symmetry restrictions. The orthogonality of the
x-even and x-odd TE-like modes in the PhC waveguides
also prohibits any interaction. Correspondingly, the odd
mode is usually not observed in transmission spectra and
its properties are regarded as irrelevant to waveguiding
in PhC waveguides.

Indeed, in the experimental TE spectra of PhC waveg-
uides with large hole radii (Fig. 1b) no evidence of this
mode at 1430nm (r/a=0.348) or 1390nm (r/a=0.379) is
observed. TE transmission spectra of PhC waveguides
with small hole radii (Fig. 3b) are also well explained
by the photonic band structure and FDTD calculations,
as discussed above. However, there is another spectral
feature present in these spectra, which does not ﬁt into
this picture of forbidden mode coupling. At wavelengths
around 1600nm, a distinct break down within the LLP
region is observed (marked with an asterisk in Fig. 3b).
Its attenuation gradually increases as a function of the
PhC waveguide length. As seen from the band struc-
ture calculations in Fig. 4b, in this spectral range no
other modes except the in-plane x-odd TE-like mode are
present. Since no indication of the x-odd TE-like mode
is visible in the spectra of short waveguides (Fig. 1b,
Fig. 3b), we can conclude that this is not an interface
phenomenon but rather the x-even TE-like mode, being
excited from the strip waveguide and gradually transfer-
ring energy to the x-odd mode. The ﬁeld energy, once
transferred, cannot couple eﬃciently into the output strip
waveguide due to symmetry restrictions and therefore
dissipates in the slab. Correspondingly, the x-even TE-
like mode exhibits additional propagation losses, which
can be estimated from Fig. 3b as 20dB/cm at the cen-
ter of the dip at around 1600nm. This weak eﬃciency of
mode coupling explains the absence of the x-odd mode
in Fig.1b since the presented PhC waveguides are only
29µm in length and the resulting losses would only be
∼ 0.5dB. Furthermore, the frequency range where both
modes coexist is located far above the light line (c/a∼0.32
in Fig. 1c) where diﬀraction losses due to out-of-plane
leakage dominate.

In general, the presence of both modes in the exper-
imental spectra indicates that the perfect symmetry of
the PhC lattice with respect to zx-plane is somehow re-
laxed and the interaction between the modes can become
possible. Two diﬀerent mechanisms can in principle be
considered that might cause the violation of symmetry
in the otherwise highly symmetric (001) plane of the SOI
wafer: structural irregularities in the PhC lattice or in-
plane optical anisotropy.

Asymmetry in the waveguide can in principle be in-
troduced by structural imperfections of the PhC lattice.
Sidewall surface roughness was measured to be only a

few nm [21] and therefore is believed to be an unlikely
candidate. Small lateral oﬀsets of the crystal can oc-
cur due to imperfect ﬁeld and sub-ﬁeld stitching when
devices are deﬁned with electron-beam lithography. Oﬀ-
sets in the y-axis would result in an xz-asymmetry of
the PhC waveguide and could be a possible cause of
mode-mixing. A ﬁeld (with dimensions of 400µm) usu-
ally has a stitch error <10-20nm while sub-ﬁelds (∼6µm)
are typically even smaller, however the impact of stitch-
ing error requires further systematic investigation. A fur-
ther possible source of asymmetry is stress in the Si ﬁlm.
While Si is a cubic crystal, and should therefore be opti-
cally isotropic, small birefringence (△n∼10−6) has been
reported [22]. Signiﬁcant birefringence can be induced
by stress, and is a known problem for SOI rib waveg-
uides [23]. However, for released Si membranes fabri-
cated on Unibond SOI wafers [24] it is diﬃcult to expect
strain higher than a few tens of MPa. Further investi-
gation is necessary to conﬁrm the origin of the observed
mode mixing.

Interestingly, the spectral signature of the x-odd TE-
like mode can also be identiﬁed in TM transmission spec-
tra. For example, the data in Fig. 6a, which shows TM
transmission spectra of PhC waveguides with r/a=0.33,
exhibit a pronounced dip around 1410nm (again marked
with an asterisk). Similar dips are also observed in the
TM transmission spectra of PhC waveguides of larger
hole radii (Inset of Fig. 7). The corresponding photonic
band structure of the TM modes in Fig. 6b cannot ex-
plain this spectral feature. Instead, its spectral position
exactly coincides with the x-odd TE-like mode at the
edge of the Brillouin zone at k=0.5 (Fig. 1a,c and Fig.
4b).

The spectral positions of these dips in both, TE
and TM spectra are plotted in Fig. 8. Data points
for r/a=0.22-0.24 are taken from TE spectra and for
r/a=0.32-0.38 from TM spectra. The solid line repre-
sents the calculated dependency of the x-odd TE-like
waveguiding mode on the hole radius for a slab thickness
of h/a=0.473. In analogy to Fig. 5, the spectral step-like
shift between the diﬀerent size series again follows the
change in the slab thickness. Remarkably all data points
for both, TE and TM spectra are in good agreement with
plane wave calculations for the x-odd TE-like mode over
the entire range of hole radii.

Just as for the TE-like transmission spectra, the at-
tenuation at the center of the dip in the TM spectra
gradually increases with waveguide length. We can there-
fore again exclude any signiﬁcant contribution of energy
transfer between the modes already at the interface be-
tween the strip waveguide and the PhC. The energy
transfer between the TM-like and TE-like x-odd mode
is taking place gradually while the light is propagating
along the waveguide.

VII. SUMMARY

In this paper we have performed an extensive investiga-
tion of the transmission properties of SOI-type PhC W1-
waveguides as a function of the hole radius, slab thickness
and the crystal length for both TE and TM polariza-
tions. Our experimental results reveal that for structural
parameters optimized for maximization of the PBG, the
bandwidth for low-loss propagation below the light line
cutoﬀ completely vanishes for hole radii r/a>0.37. This
is mainly caused by a tremendous spectral shift of the
lower band edge slab modes, which are mostly localized
in the slab surrounding the holes and are strongly in-
ﬂuenced by a decrease of the average refractive index of
the slab. PhC W1-waveguides with a maximized PBG
are therefore unsuitable for integrated photonics appli-
cations. The experimental ﬁndings for PhC waveguides
possessing small holes with only r/a∼0.2 demonstrate
that the bandwidth for transmission can be maximized
to almost 130nm while still maintaining a suﬃcient PBG.
Losses for these devices are reduced to only 8dB/cm pre-
sumably due to a signiﬁcantly lower surface area of the
holes sidewalls. The experimental transmission spectra
for both TE and TM polarizations show very good agree-
ment with calculated photonic band structures and 3D-
FDTD transmission spectra.

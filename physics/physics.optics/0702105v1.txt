A three-dimensional degree of polarization based

A measure of the degree of polarization for the three-dimensional polarization

matrix (coherence matrix) of an electromagnetic ﬁeld is proposed, based on

Rayleigh scattering. The degree of polarization, due to dipole scattering of

the three-dimensional state of polarization, is averaged over all scattering

directions. This gives a well-deﬁned purity measure, which, unlike other

proposed measures of the three-dimensional degree of polarization, is not

a unitary invariant of the matrix. This is demonstrated and discussed for

several examples, including a partially polarized transverse beam.

Introduction

Polarization is a fundamental property of electromagnetic ﬁelds. Its eﬀects are partic-

ularly important when the ﬁeld’s 3-dimensional, vectorial character plays a role, such

as radiation from sources, the optical near-ﬁeld, tightly-focussed beams, and scatte-

ring. In these situations, the conventional theory of partial paraxial polarization fails.

1

There has been recent interest in extending the theory of partial polarization to these

nonparaxial situations, particularly the notion of degree of polarization (e.g. Refs.

1–7 and references therein).

The transverse polarization properties of optical beams are well understood.1, 8

The theory is based on the hermitian 2

with averaging over some ensemble of transverse ﬁeld vectors E = (E1, E2). This

matrix has a unique linear decomposition: ρ2 = P2ρpure + (1

When ρ2 is decomposed via the basis of Pauli matrices, the coeﬃcients are the Stokes

parameters S1, S2, S3 (S0 = 1 since tr ρ2 is normalized). The sum of squares S2

2 ; on propagation through rotators and retarders (represented by unitary

transformations on ρ2), the Stokes parameters may change, but P2 does not.

The theory of 3-dimensional partially coherent ﬁelds is less well developed. Even

in fully polarized ﬁelds, the Stokes parameter description fails since the plane of the

polarization ellipses varies with position. Furthermore, in partially polarized ﬁelds,

polarization states with ellipses in diﬀerent planes may be incoherently mixed. Sev-

eral measures of the 3-dimensional degree of polarization have been proposed and

2

discussed;2, 4–6 these measures, discussed below, have the property of unitary invari-

ance: they only depend on the eigenvalues of the 3-dimensional polarization matrix

ρ3, by analogy with unitary invariance of P2. In terms of a measure on the eigenval-

ues, P2 is clearly unique (up to monotonic transformations, such as squaring), since

after trace normalization, the two eigenvalues have only one freedom (their diﬀer-

ence). However, for 3

3 polarization matrices, there are two such freedoms, and

×

there is no unique mathematical deﬁnition for the degree of polarization; it is there-

fore appropriate to examine measures that emerge naturally out of physical processes,

even if desirable mathematical requirements have to be relaxed. Clearly, one such re-

quirement that cannot be satisﬁed in three dimensions is the decomposition of the

polarization matrix into purely polarized and purely unpolarized parts;4 the inter-

mediate eigenvalue must also play a role in any matrix decomposition (the largest

and smallest eigenvalues corresponding to the completely polarized and unpolarized

parts).

This is the optical analog of a well-known problem in quantum mechanics, namely

the non-uniqueness of the decomposition of a general density matrix.9–11 Thus, the

deﬁnition of the degree of polarization is chosen here to correspond to that of a purity

measure in quantum mechanics: a purely polarized state (with eigenvalues 1, 0, 0)

always has measure 1, and the completely unpolarized state (1/3 times the identity

matrix), isotropic in all directions, has measure 0; any other state of polarization has

a value in between. For ρ2, P2 clearly satisﬁes this, and is eﬀectively unique. However,

under this deﬁnition, the quantity proposed in Ref. 4 (the diﬀerence between the two

larger eigenvalues of ρ3) – motivated by the eigenvalue decomposition of polarization

3

– is not a purity measure, as anisotropic states of 3-dimensional polarization, which

have directional information, are counted as completely unpolarized (for instance, a

completely unpolarized paraxial beam has directional information (its propagation

direction), but its eigenvalues are 1, 1, 0). In quantum mechanics and paraxial optics,

such unitary invariance is a physical requirement, but there seems to be no strong

argument for this in the nonparaxial case,3 a point discussed towards the end of this

article.

Here, I describe an alternative measure for the degree of polarization in three

dimensions, based on isotropic Rayleigh scattering, which is not a unitary invariant

of ρ3. This is deﬁned and discussed in the following section, then in Section 3, is

compared with various other 3-dimensional polarization measures for various speciﬁc

examples of ρ3. The ﬁnal section consists of a discussion of various issues associated

with the Rayleigh-deﬁned degree of polarization and non-unitarity.

2. The Rayleigh-deﬁned degree of polarization

Rayleigh scattering is a fundamental 3-dimensional optical phenomenon, and is of

primary importance in scattering theory.12–14 At an isotropic scatterer, of dimension

much smaller than the optical wavelength, the possibly incoherent electromagnetic

ﬁeld is represented by density matrix ρ3 (deﬁned analogously to ρ2 in Eq. (1)). Par-

tially polarized rays are scattered in all directions θ, φ; the properties of the scattered

ray in θ, φ are determined by the polarization matrix12, 13

ρ2(θ, φ) =

where σ is the total scattering cross-section, and p⊥(θ, φ) is a projection matrix,

projecting into the plane perpendicular to the unit vector u(θ, φ) in the direction

θ, φ. Although ρ2(θ, φ) is 3

3, it is null in (appears transverse to) the direction

×

u(θ, φ) by deﬁnition. ρ2(θ, φ) is not trace-normalized, its trace being the intensity

I(θ, φ) scattered in the θ, φ-direction:

I(θ, φ) = tr ρ2(θ, φ)

(4)

(this is the diﬀerential scattering cross section12, 13). The scattering mechanism is

here idealized such that the scatterer experiences no recoil (there is no center-of-mass

motion in the scattering).

The degree of polarization of the scattered light depends on the scattering direc-

tion, but is otherwise similar to Eq. (2),

P 2

2 (θ, φ) =

2 tr ρ2

where the denominator equals I(θ, φ). The Rayleigh-deﬁned degree of polarization

PRay is taken to be the average over all directions of P (θ, φ), weighted with respect

to I(θ, φ) :

ellipse ensemble. The imaginary part is an axial vector, N = (N1, N2, N3), the aver-

age angular momentum vector of the ensemble. A completely unpolarized ensemble

(representing, for instance, black-body radiation) is therefore represented by a sphere,

and a pure polarization state by an ellipse with orthogonal vector (whose length is

the ellipse area). For a pure polarization state, the 1 (2)-axis is the major (minor)

axis of the polarization ellipse, and the 3-axis is its angular momentum direction: the

ﬂat ellipsoid (M3 = 0) has axes proportional to the polarization ellipse axes squared

and vector can change under unitary transformation.

The ellipsoid M and vector N generalize features of ρ2; the real part Re ρ2 de-

ﬁnes an ellipse, and the imaginary part, proportional to the Stokes parameter S3,

is the overall angular momentum perpendicular to the transverse plane. The polar-

ization state ρ2(θ, φ) of a scattered ray is geometrically determined by projection;

the transverse ellipse of its real part is the projection of the ellipsoid in the plane

perpendicular to θ, φ, and its imaginary part is the projection of N into u(θ, φ), as

depicted in Fig. 1 projecting in the coordinate axis directions. PRay is the average of

the degree of polarization over all these projections.

Although PRay depends only on the polarization matrix ρ3, it cannot be simply

expressed in terms of the matrix elements. Nevertheless, it is a purity measure on the

density matrix ρ3, as deﬁned above. If ρ3 represents a pure state, its eigenvalues are

1, 0, 0, and so P2(θ, φ) (the diﬀerence divided by the sum of eigenvalues of ρ2(θ, φ))

directions are also shown.

is 1 for almost all directions, thus PRay = 1. Conversely, PRay = 1 in Eq. (6) only if

P (θ, φ) = 1 for almost all directions, which only occurs if one eigenvalue of ρ2(θ, φ)

is zero, implying ρ3 is pure. Similarly, PRay = 0 if and only if ρ3 is the completely

unpolarized 3-dimensional matrix 1/3.

In this argument, ‘almost all’ assumes its technical sense, that is, for all values

contributing to the integrals in (6). If ρ3 represents a pure state of linear polariza-

tion diag

, the ray scattered in the 1-direction has zero intensity, but such an

isolated direction does not aﬀect PRay.

3. Comparison with other measures of degree of polarization, and values

for sample polarization matrices

In this section, speciﬁc examples of 3-dimensional ensembles represented by particular

polarization matrices ρ3 are considered, demonstrating explicitly that PRay is not a

7

unitary invariant; progress by means of example is the only way understanding of PRay,

in the absence of a general closed analytic form. Before discussing these examples, I

will describe some other measures which are unitary invariant, that is, they depend

solely on the eigenvalues 1

Another important purity measure for quantum density matrices is the von Neumann

This is the natural purity measure in quantum statistical mechanics,9, 15 and is con-

sidered here for comparison. Each of the measures deﬁned in Eqs. (8), (9), (10) is a

purity measure, and in a neighborhood of the totally unpolarized state, is linear in

the eigenvalues.

An important question is how the various 3-dimensional degrees of polarization

measure a paraxially polarized beam; this is the case usually considered in discussions

of Rayleigh scattering. In this case, the choice of cartesian coordinates in Eq. (7)

unpolarized state with S1 = S3 = 0, has some measure of 3-dimensional polarization,

as it appears completely unpolarized only in the propagation direction; its purity can

neither be 0 nor 1. PRay is plotted as a function of S1 and S3 in Fig. 2; although its

main dependence is on P2, there is weak dependence on the angle arctan(S3/S1). The

paraxial partially polarized ρ3 is pure when P2 = 1, and all deﬁnitions of polarization

agree here. When P2 = 0, PRay = Pquad = Plin = 1/2, and PvN =

where the gradient for PRay,ex1 is determined by numerical integration. The two en-

sembles thus have diﬀerent Rayleigh-deﬁned degrees of polarization for all a > 0. By

comparison, unitary invariance means the three other measures do not distinguish be-

tween the two ensembles, with Plin = 2a/3, and Pquad = a/√3 (PvN is approximately

linear in a, but cannot be expressed simply).

4. Discussion

Elements of the polarization matrices ρ2, ρ3 are complex when the polarization states

in the underlying ensembles have some elliptical or circular polarization; in ρ2, this

is given by a nonzero value of the third Stokes parameter S3, and in ρ3, by a nonzero

net angular momentum vector N . Therefore, unitary invariance implies that states

of elliptic polarization are treated equivalently to states of linear polarization. This

is clearly appropriate for paraxially propagating states of polarization, where all po-

larization states are on the same footing on the Poincar´e sphere, and may be freely

transformed to each other by retarders and rotators without changing the degree of

polarization.

11

The situation is less clear in nonparaxial physics, where there are several well-

known deviations from the paraxial case, such as the polarization topology of in-

homogeneous 3-dimensional ﬁelds,16, 17 and the geometric phase in twisted optical

ﬁbers.18, 19 This diﬀerence originates in the fact that the 3-dimensional orientation

of a state of linear polarization requires two parameters (the direction of the real E

vector), but the orientation of elliptic polarization requires three (the Euler angles

of the polarization ellipse). In Rayleigh scattering, a ray’s polarization is given by

the projection of the 3-dimensional polarization matrix into the transverse plane of

the ray by Eq. (3); complex states of elliptic polarization project over all directions

diﬀerently than real states of linear polarization, and this is manifest in the lack of

unitary invariance in PRay, ultimately due to the non-unitarity of the physical mecha-

nism of Rayleigh scattering. Given the geometric diﬀerence between nonparaxial and

paraxial polarization, it seems that appealing to analogy with the two-dimensional

paraxial case is insuﬃcient motivation by itself for demanding the unitary invariance

of the 3-dimensional degree of polarization; consideration of other physical instances

of the 3-dimensional polarization matrix, such as in near-ﬁeld diﬀraction, or light in

a twisted ﬁber, may lead to other physically-motivated deﬁnitions of the polarization

matrix that are, or are not, unitarily invariant.

The deﬁnition (6) can be modiﬁed mathematically to give a unitarily invariant

version of PRay, at the cost of the physical interpretation. Instead of averaging over

symmetric projections perpendicular to the observation direction u(θ, φ), one inte-

grates over complex hermitian projections that are orthogonal to all complex vectors

(i.e. all polarization states). This average respects unitary invariance, and ρ3 can be

12

diagonalized before the average is taken. Therefore, under this unitary invariant mea-

sure, the partially polarized paraxial ensembles behave like PRay with S3 = 0 (plotted

in Fig. 3), the examples 1 and 2 both behave like example 1, and any degenerate ρ3

as the axisymmetric example.

The geometrical interpretation of the 3-dimensional polarization matrix was used

in Ref. 20 to describe the polarization of skylight using a canopy atmosphere model.

Incident sunlight is Rayleigh scattered in a thin layer of ﬁxed height above the plane

of the observer, giving rise to ρ3 independent of position; the polarization in an

observation direction was found using an orthogonal projection of this matrix (by Eq.

(3)); in particular, the neutral points,14, 21 where the degree of polarization vanishes,

correspond to the Maxwell axes of the ellipsoid.22

Clearly, the deﬁnition of PRay in (6) is not the only way P2(θ, φ) and I(θ, φ)

can be combined to give a well-deﬁned degree of polarization; for instance, any

positive powers can be used, and I(θ, φ) need not be included. In particular, the

choice P2(θ, φ)2I(θ, φ)2 in the integrand can be easily integrated, yielding 2[3 tr M2

−
N ]/[tr M2 + 3(tr M)2]. The choice of (6) is made here not only be-

(tr M)2 + 5N

·

cause its deﬁnition is physically natural, but also it is closer, at least in the examples

considered, to the measures Plin and Pquad. In quantum mechanics, it is more usual

to consider the squares of the purity measures considered in optics (such as the mea-

sures in Eqs. (9) and (10)); the squares are more natural from the point of view of

mathematical deﬁnition, but do not appear directly (in two dimensions) in terms of

the elegant decomposition ρ2 = P2ρpure + P2ρ2,un.

It may be possible to determine the Rayleigh degree of polarization directly by ex-

13

perimental measurement. A possible Rayleigh scatterer in such an experiment would

be a metallic nanoparticle, embedded in some transparent medium; this would be

placed in an appropriate incoherent light ﬁeld represented by the desired ρ3, suﬃ-

ciently constant over the lengthscale of the particle. It would only be necessary to

measure the polarization of ρ2(θ, φ) over a hemisphere, as the projections in Eq. (3)

do not distinguish

u(θ, φ) – measuring the polarization over a large number of scat-

±

tering directions may cause technical problems, and further discussion is outside the

scope of the present work. Of course, the average over all directions of the scattered

ray polarization depends on the kind of scatterer (anisotropic Rayleigh, Mie, etc); it

is likely that diﬀerent, scatterer-dependent measures of the degree of polarization can

be deﬁned. However, these other scatterers have some internal structure, unlike an

isotropic Rayleigh scatterer, and the Rayleigh degree of polarization depends only on

the electromagnetic polarization matrix ρ3.

Projecting a density matrix on subspaces is reminiscent of Gleason’s theorem11, 23

in quantum mechanics, in which projection assigns weights to 1-dimensional sub-

spaces. However, averaging such one-dimensional projections (over all hermitian pro-

jections, being quantum mechanical) only gives the trace; this construction completely

misses the complicated structure of PRay, and even its unitary counterpart.

The 3-dimensional polarization matrix is insuﬃcient to describe propagation of

partially coherent nonparaxial ﬁelds, since propagation direction information is also

required (in the form, for instance, of a Wigner function24). It is not clear physically

how a 3-dimensional degree of polarization ought to behave under propagation, espe-

cially if it is assumed to depend only on the polarization matrix. Mechanisms such as

14

dipole scattering, however, are completely independent of the propagation directions

of the electromagnetic ﬁelds giving rise to the polarization matrix (neglecting recoil

eﬀects), and are therefore a natural place to ﬁnd physical relevance of measures of

the 3-dimensional degree of polarization. However, as has been shown, the natural

measure based on this process does not depend only on the eigenvalues of ρ3 (it is

not a unitary invariant), unlike other measures which have been proposed. The as-

sumptions behind the deﬁnition of the 3-dimensional degree of polarization therefore

require further consideration.

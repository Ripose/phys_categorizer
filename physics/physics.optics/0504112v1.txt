Slow light in photonic crystals

Alex Figotin and Ilya Vitebskiy

Abstract. The problem of slowing down light by orders of magnitude has been
extensively discussed in the literature. Such a possibility can be useful in a variety
of optical and microwave applications. Many qualitatively diﬀerent approaches
have been explored. Here we discuss how this goal can be achieved in linear
dispersive media, such as photonic crystals. The existence of slowly propagating
electromagnetic waves in photonic crystals is quite obvious and well known. The
main problem, though, has been how to convert the input radiation into the
slow mode without loosing a signiﬁcant portion of the incident light energy to
absorption, reﬂection, etc. We show that the so-called frozen mode regime oﬀers
a unique solution to the above problem. Under the frozen mode regime, the
incident light enters the photonic crystal with little reﬂection and, subsequently,
is completely converted into the frozen mode with huge amplitude and almost zero
group velocity. The linearity of the above eﬀect allows to slow light regardless
of its intensity. An additional advantage of photonic crystals over other methods
of slowing down light is that photonic crystals can preserve both time and space
coherence of the input electromagnetic wave.

1. Introduction

1.1. What is slow light?

It is a common knowledge that in vacuum light propagates with constant velocity
108m/sec. In optically transparent nondispersive media, the speed of light
c
propagation is diﬀerent

v = ω/k = c/n,

(1)

where k is the wave number, ω is the respective frequency, and n is the refractive
index of the medium. At optical frequencies, the refractive index n of transparent
materials usually does not exceed several units, and the speed of light propagation is
of the same order of magnitude as in vacuum.

The situation can change dramatically in strongly dispersive media. Although
the phase velocity of light is still determined by the same expression (1), the speed of
electromagnetic pulse propagation is diﬀerent from v and is determined by the group
velocity [1, 2, 3]

which is one of the most important electromagnetic characteristics of the medium.
With certain reservations, the group velocity u coincides with the electromagnetic
energy velocity and is usually referred to simply as the propagation speed of light in
the medium. Hereinafter, the speed of light propagation means the group velocity (2),
rather then the phase velocity (1).

Strong dispersion means that the group velocity u strongly depends on the
frequency and can be substantially diﬀerent from c. In the slow light case, which is the
subject of our interest, the electromagnetic pulse propagates through the dispersive
medium at the speed u
c, regardless of the respective value of the phase velocity (1).
In some cases, u can even become vanishingly small implying that the electromagnetic
wave at the respective frequency does not transfer the energy. In another extreme
case, the group velocity u can exceed c (the so-called case of superluminal pulse
propagation), without contradicting the causality principle [1, 4, 5, 6, 7].
In yet
another case of a left-handed medium, the group velocity u can have the opposite sign
to that of the phase velocity v [8]. But again, in this paper we will focus exclusively
on the slow light and related phenomena.

Slow and ultraslow light have numerous and diverse practical applications.
The related phenomena include dramatic enhancement of nonlinear eﬀects (higher
harmonic generation, wave mixing, etc.), magnetic Faraday rotation, as well as many
other important electromagnetic properties of the optical media. Such an enhancement
can facilitate design of controllable optical delay lines, phase shifters, miniature and
eﬃcient optical ampliﬁers and lasers, etc.
In addition, ultraslow light might allow
nonlinear interactions down to a single photon level, which could signiﬁcantly beneﬁt
the design of ultrasensitive optical switches, quantum all-optical data storage and data
processing devices. Ultraslow light can also be used in quantum communication and
design of novel acousto-optical devices. This list can be continued. For more detailed
information on the prospective practical applications of slow light phenomena see, for
example, [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]
and references therein.

1.2. Temporal dispersion versus spatial dispersion

In recent years, several diﬀerent approaches have been pursued in order to slow down
or even completely stop the light. These approaches can be grouped into two major
categories:

- those where the low group velocity results from strong temporal dispersion dn/dω

of optical media;

- those where the low speed of pulse propagation is a result of coherent interference

in spatially periodic heterogeneous media, such as photonic crystals.

Let us start with a brief discussion of slow light phenomena in media with strong

temporal dispersion.

1.2.1.
Slow light in media with strong temporal dispersion Assuming that the
refractive index n in (2) is of the order of unity, which is usually the case at optical
frequencies, one can state that a very low group velocity can only occur if n varies

Strong frequency dependence of the refractive index n can be a result of excitation
of electronic or some other intrinsic resonances of the medium, which are normally
accompanied by strong absorption of light. Recently, though, several techniques have

Slow light in photonic crystals

been developed that allow to signiﬁcantly suppress the absorption of light at the
frequency where the derivative dn/dω peaks.

One of the most successful ways to suppress light absorption is based on the eﬀect
of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) [31]. In such a case, the incident
light interacts with atomic spin excitations forming combined excitations of photons
and spins, called dark-state polaritons. These polaritons propagate slowly through
the medium in the form of a sharply compressed pulse, the energy of which is much
smaller than that of the incident light pulse. Most of the incident light energy is
expended to create the coherent state of the atomic spins, the rest is carried away
by the control electromagnetic ﬁeld. The pulse delay inside the medium is limited
by the bandwidth of the transparency window, which decreases with propagation
distance. At higher propagation distances the medium becomes increasingly opaque
at frequencies other than the line center, further reducing the available transparency
window [12, 13]. Speciﬁc physical mechanisms of such transformations are very diverse.
The detailed description of EIT and related phenomena can be found in the extensive
literature on the subject (see, for example, [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], and references
therein). The techniques based on EIT have already produced some amazing results,
such as reduction of the speed of pulse propagation by 7 – 8 orders of magnitude
compared to the speed of light in vacuum, while providing a huge and controllable
pulse delay.

Another method to create a transparency window in otherwise opaque substance
was used in [15, 16]. This method involves the creation of a spectral hole by the
periodic modulation of the ground state population at the beat frequency between
the pump and the probe ﬁelds applied to the material sample. It can produce slow
light in a solid-state material at room temperature. The spectral hole created by this
technique can be extremely narrow (36 Hz in the experiment [15, 16]), and leads to
a rapid spectral variation of refractive index.
It allowed to reduce the light group
velocity in a ruby crystal down to 57 m/s.

Physically, the above approaches to slowing down the light can be viewed as
a reversible transformation of the input nearly monochromatic light into some kind
of coherent atomic excitations (e.g., dark-state polaritons) with very low relaxation
rate and low group velocity.
In other words, ultraslow pulse propagating through
such a medium is, in fact, an intrinsic coherent excitation triggered by the input
light, rather than a light pulse per se. This process always involves some kind of a
delicate resonant light-matter interaction with extremely small bandwidth. Indeed,
the relation (3) yields the following limitation on the slow pulse bandwidth

∆ω
ω

<

c

,

(4)

where the assumption is made that the refractive index n within the transparency
window is of the order of unity. The condition (4) can also be viewed as a constraint
on the minimal propagation speed of a light pulse with a given bandwidth ∆ω. On
the positive side, the approach based on EIT or its modiﬁcations does produce an
exceptionally low speed of pulse propagation, which can have numerous practical
implications.

In the rest of the paper we focus exclusively on those techniques which do
not involve any intrinsic resonant excitations of the medium and, therefore, do not
essentially rely on strong temporal dispersion.
Instead, we will focus on spatially
periodic dielectric arrays, in which low group velocity results solely from spatial

Slow light in photonic crystals

inhomogeneity of the optical medium.

1.2.2. Slow light in spatially periodic arrays Well-known examples of optical periodic
dielectric structures include photonic crystals [32], periodic arrays of coupled optical
resonators [18, 19, 20, 21], and line-defect waveguides [24]. Generally, a periodic
heterogeneous medium can be assigned a meaningful refractive index n only if the
structural period L is much smaller compared to the light wavelength λ

≪
On the other hand, a signiﬁcant spatial dispersion associated with heterogeneity of
the medium can occur only when L and λ are comparable in value

L

λ.

L

∼
In particular, the relation (6) deﬁnes a necessary condition under which heterogeneity
of the medium can lead to low speed of electromagnetic pulse propagation. Hence, in
the cases where low speed of pulse propagation is a result of strong spatial dispersion,
one cannot assign a meaningful refractive index to the composite medium, and the
expression (3) for the group velocity of light does not apply.

At optical frequencies, the speed of pulse propagation in periodic dielectric arrays
can be reduced by two – three orders of magnitude. This is not a fundamental
restriction, but rather a technological limitation related to the diﬃculty of building
ﬂawless periodic arrays at nanoscales. On the positive side, the dielectric components
of the periodic array are not required to display strong temporal dispersion and,
hence, absorption of light is not an essential and unavoidable problem in this case.
In addition, the photonic crystal based approach is much more versatile in terms of
the input light intensity. It allows the same photonic device to operate both at high
and low intensity of the input light. By contrast, utilizing strong temporal dispersion
always involves signiﬁcant nonlinearity and usually is limited to a certain amplitude
of the input light.

There is a natural bandwidth limitation on the slowed pulse in periodic dielectric
arrays, which is similar to the case of slow light in time-dispersive media. Indeed, let
∆ω be the frequency bandwidth of a pulse and ∆k – the respective range of the Bloch
wave number. The average group velocity

of the pulse is deﬁned as

Let us make the following natural assumptions.

(i) The pulse propagating inside the periodic medium is composed of the Bloch
eigenmodes belonging to the same spectral branch of the dispersion relation ω (k).
This assumption implies that ∆k cannot exceed the size 2π/L of the Brillouin
zone

∆k < 2π/L,

where L is the unit cell length of the periodic array.

(ii) The refractive index of the constitutive components of the periodic array is of the

order of unity and, therefore,

where λ0 is the light wavelength in vacuum.

The restriction (10) is similar to that deﬁned by the inequality (4) and related to the

Any attempt to circumvent the restriction (10) would involve some kind of pulse

1.2.3. Examples of periodic arrays supporting slow light

Coupled resonator optical waveguide During the last several years, a tremendous
progress has been made in theory and applications of periodic arrays of coupled optical
resonators. Generally, if the coupling between adjacent resonators in a periodic chain
is weak, the group velocity of Bloch excitations supported by such a periodic array is
low. This is true regardless of the nature of individual resonators. The above simple
idea forms the basis for one of the most popular approaches to slowing down the light.
An extensive discussion on the subject and numerous examples and references can be
found in [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23].

Qualitatively similar situation occurs in line-defect waveguides in a photonic
crystal slab, where a periodic array of structural defects plays the role of weakly
coupled optical resonators. Following [24], consider a photonic crystal slab with two-
dimensional periodic array of holes and a line defects in it, which is a row of missing
holes. The line defects have a waveguiding mode with two types of cutoﬀ within
the photonic band gap. These characteristics can be tuned by controlling the defect
width. Theoretical calculations supported by interference measurements show that
the single waveguiding mode of the line-defect waveguide displays extraordinarily large
group dispersion. In some instances, the corresponding traveling speed is 2 orders of
magnitude slower than that in air. According to [24], one of the major limiting factor
here is structural imperfection of the array.

Slow light phenomena in periodic arrays of weakly coupled resonators have been
the subject of a great number of resent publications, including some excellent review
articles cited above. For this reason, further in this paper we will not discuss this
subject any more.

Photonic crystals. Photonic crystals are spatially periodic structures composed of
usually two diﬀerent transparent dielectric materials [32]. Similarly to periodic arrays
of coupled resonators, in photonic crystals, low group velocity of light can result from
multiple scattering of individual photons by periodic spatial inhomogeneities, rather
than from temporal dispersion of the substance [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. The lowest
group velocity achievable in photonic crystals for a given pulse bandwidth can be close
to that deﬁned by the fundamental restriction (10). For example, if we want a pulse to
3c, its bandwidth ∆ω should be less
propagate undistorted at the speed as low as 10−
3ω, which at optical frequencies is of the order of 10 GHz. In this respect,
than 10−
the situation in photonic crystals is as good as it can possibly be in any other linear
passive media with limited refraction index.

Slow light in photonic crystals

Unlike the case of optical waveguides and linear arrays of coupled resonators,
in photonic crystals we have bulk electromagnetic waves capable of propagating in
any direction through the periodic heterogeneous structure. This results in much
greater density of modes, compared to that of the above mentioned arrays of coupled
resonators.
In addition, electromagnetic waves in photonic crystals can remain
coherent in all three dimensions, which is also essential for a variety of practical
applications.

A major problem with slow light in photonic crystals is the eﬃciency of conversion
of the incident light into the slow mode inside the heterogeneous medium. We shall
see in the next section that in most cases the incident electromagnetic wave with the
frequency of one of the slow modes is simply reﬂected back to space, without creating
the slow mode inside the photonic crystal. How to overcome this fundamental problem
and, thereby, how to transform a signiﬁcant fraction of the incident light energy into
a slow mode with drastically enhanced amplitude, is one of the primary subjects of
this paper.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe, in general terms,
what kind of slow modes can exist in photonic crystals and under what circumstances
some of these modes can be eﬀectively excited by incident light. We show, that there
is a unique situation, which we call the frozen mode regime, when the incident light
can enter the photonic crystal with little reﬂection and be completely converted into
a slow mode with nearly zero group velocity and drastically enhanced amplitude.

Section 3 gives an overall picture of the frozen mode regime in periodic layered
media, without going into the detailed analysis based on the Maxwell equations. All
the statements made in this section are later proven in Sections 5 through 12.

In section 4 we deﬁne the physical conditions under which a periodic layered
array can support the frozen mode regime. These conditions boil down to whether
or not the electromagnetic dispersion relation of the periodic array can develop a
stationary inﬂection point (15). This requirement imposes quite severe restrictions on
composition and geometry of periodic layered medium. We show, in particular, that
in the case of light propagating normally to the layers, the frozen mode regime can
only occur if some of the layers are magnetic with signiﬁcant nonreciprocal Faraday

is not required, which makes it possible to realize the frozen mode regime at any
frequency range, including optical and UV. A trade-oﬀ though is that at least some of
the layers of a non-magnetic stack must display signiﬁcant dielectric anisotropy with
tilted orientation of the anisotropy axis.

Section 5 is devoted to electrodynamics of periodic layered media. Particular
attention is given to the cases where some of the layers display dielectric and/or
magnetic anisotropy, because otherwise, the electromagnetic dispersion relation ω (k)
of the periodic array cannot develop a stationary inﬂection point (15) and, therefore,
cannot produce the frozen mode regime.

Sections 6 through 12 constitute the analytical basis for the entire investigation.
There we present a rigorous and systematic analysis of the scattering problem for a
semi-inﬁnite periodic array of anisotropic dielectric layers. The emphasis is on the
vicinity of stationary points (12) of the electromagnetic dispersion relation, where
the slow electromagnetic modes can be excited. The comparative analysis of all
possible stationary points shows that only a stationary inﬂection point (15) can provide
necessary conditions for slowing down and ”freezing” a signiﬁcant fraction of incoming

radiation. In all other cases, the incident wave is either reﬂected back to space, or gets
converted into a ”fast” propagating mode with low amplitude. The exact analytical
results of these sections are supported by a number of numerical simulations.

2. Stationary points of dispersion relations and slow modes

In periodic heterogeneous media, such as photonic crystals, the speed of light is deﬁned
as the wave group velocity

where ~k is the Bloch wave vector and ω = ω

is the respective frequency. At some

frequencies, the dispersion relation ω

can develop stationary points

where the group velocity ~u vanishes. Zero group velocity usually implies that the
respective Bloch eigenmode does not transfer electromagnetic energy. Indeed, with
certain reservations, the energy ﬂux ~S of a propagating Bloch mode is

where W is the electromagnetic energy density associated with this mode. If W is
bounded, then the group velocity ~u and the energy ﬂux ~S vanish simultaneously at the
respective stationary point (12) of the dispersion relation. Such modes are referred to
as slow modes, or slow light. Some examples of stationary points (12) are shown in
Fig. 1, where each of the frequencies ωa, ωb, ωg, ω0 is associated with slow mode.

The electromagnetic dispersion relation of any photonic crystal displays an inﬁnite
number of stationary points like those shown in Fig. 1. But, a common problem with
almost all of them is that the respective slow modes cannot be excited in a semi-
inﬁnite photonic crystal by incident light. This explains why there have been only a
few attempts to exploit the photonic crystals for slowing down the light. Let us take
a closer look at this problem.

Consider a scattering problem of a plane monochromatic wave normally incident
on a lossless semi-inﬁnite photonic slab with the electromagnetic dispersion relation
shown in Fig. 1. The symbols ΨI , ΨR, and ΨT
in Fig. 2 denote the incident,
reﬂected, and transmitted waves, respectively. The transmittance τ and reﬂectance ρ
of the semi-inﬁnite slab are deﬁned as

τ =

(14)

where SI , SR and ST are the normal energy ﬂuxes of the respective waves.

If the frequency ω is close to the band edge frequency ωg in Fig. 1, then the
incident wave will be totally reﬂected back into space, as illustrated in Fig. 3. This
implies that the fraction of the incident wave energy converted into the slow mode
corresponding to the point g in Fig. 1 vanishes as ω

ωg.

In another case, where the incident wave frequency is close to either of the
characteristic values ωa or ωb in Fig. 1, the slab transmittance remains ﬁnite, as
seen in Fig. 3. This implies that the incident wave will be partially transmitted into
the semi-inﬁnite photonic slab. The problem, though, is that none of the transmitted

light will propagate inside the slab in the form of the slow mode corresponding to the
respective stationary point a or b. For example, at frequency ωa, all the transmitted
light corresponds to the ”fast” propagating mode with positive and large group velocity
and the wave number diﬀerent from that corresponding to the point a in Fig. 1.
Similar situation takes place at ω = ωb: the fraction of the transmitted light that is
converted into the respective slow mode vanishes as ω

ωb.

Let us turn now to the stationary inﬂection point 0 in Fig. 1, where both the
ﬁrst and the second derivatives of the frequency ω with respect to k vanish, while the
third derivative is ﬁnite

(15)

In such a case, the incident plane wave can be transmitted into the semi-inﬁnite
photonic crystal with little reﬂection, as demonstrated in Fig. 3. But most remarkably,
having entered the photonic slab, the light is completely converted into the slow mode
with inﬁnitesimal group velocity and drastically enhanced amplitude. Such a behavior
is uniquely associated with stationary inﬂection point (15) of the dispersion relation

As the result, the energy ﬂux (13) associated with the transmitted frozen mode
remains ﬁnite and comparable with that of the incident wave even at the frozen mode
frequency ω0 corresponding to the point 0 of the dispersion relation in Fig. 1. Such
a spectacular behavior is uniquely attributed to the stationary inﬂection point (15)
of the electromagnetic dispersion relation. Of course, in reality, the electromagnetic
energy density W of the frozen mode will be limited by such factors as absorption,
nonlinear eﬀects, imperfection of the periodic dielectric array, deviation of the incident
radiation from a perfect plane monochromatic wave, ﬁniteness of the photonic slab
dimensions, etc. Still, with all these limitations in place, the frozen mode regime can
be very attractive for a variety of practical applications.

In the following sections we present a detailed analysis of the frozen mode regime
associated with stationary inﬂection point (15). In the rest of this section we brieﬂy
discuss the eﬀect of photonic crystal boundaries on slow light phenomena.

2.1. Slow light in a ﬁnite photonic slab

Up to this point we have considered light incident on the surface of a semi-inﬁnite
photonic crystal. Since real photonic crystals are always bounded, the question arises
whether and how the photonic crystal boundaries aﬀect the conditions of slow mode
excitation and propagation.

To start with, let us recall that in an unbounded (inﬁnite) photonic crystal, the
speed of light propagation is deﬁned as its group velocity (11), which determines the

If instead of an inﬁnite photonic crystal we have a bounded photonic slab of
thickness D, as shown in Fig. 4 and 5, the simple interpretation of the group velocity
u as the speed of pulse propagation can still apply, provided that the space length l
of the pulse inside the photonic slab is much smaller than the slab itself

l

D.

(19)

≪
In other words, one can introduce the speed of pulse propagation inside the slab only
if the entire pulse can ﬁt inside the slab, as in the situation shown in Fig. 5. In the
slow light case, the group velocity u decreases sharply, and so does the pulse length l
in (17). Therefore, a slow pulse with a ﬁxed bandwidth ∆ω is more likely to ﬁt inside
the photonic slab than a fast pulse with the same bandwidth. The slower the pulse is,
the better the condition (19) is satisﬁed. Taking into account the relations (17) and
(18), the condition (19) can also be recast as a lower limit on the pulse bandwidth

(20)

implying that in order to ﬁt inside the slab, the pulse should not have too narrow
bandwidth.

If a pulse satisfying the condition (19) or, equivalently, (20) is incident on a ﬁnite
photonic slab, the slab can be treated as a semi-inﬁnite medium until the pulse actually

Slow light in photonic crystals

hits the opposite boundary of the slab. Except for the next subsection, all the results
discussed in this paper relate to the case (19), where we can explicitly and literally
talk about pulse propagation inside the medium and where the group velocity u in
(11) does have the meaning of the speed of pulse propagation.

2.2. Resonant eﬀects in a ﬁnite photonic slab

A qualitatively diﬀerent picture emerges if the pulse length l deﬁned in Eq. (17) is
comparable in magnitude or exceeds the slab thickness D. In such a case, the slab is
too thin to accommodate the entire pulse and the electromagnetic ﬁeld ΨT inside the
slab becomes a superposition of forward and backward propagating waves undergoing
multiple reﬂections from two opposite boundaries of the slab. This situation by no
means can be interpreted as an individual pulse propagating through the periodic
medium, because at any moment of time the electromagnetic ﬁeld inside the slab
cannot be viewed as a wave packet built around a single propagating mode. The term
”slow light” does not literary apply here and, therefore, this case goes beyond the
scope of this paper. Yet, it would be appropriate to discuss brieﬂy what happens if
the photonic slab becomes too thin to be treated as semi-inﬁnite.

This is clearly seen in Fig. 7.

At this point we would like to compare the frozen mode regime introduced in the
previous subsection and the Fabry-Perot cavity resonance. Both eﬀects result from
coherent interference of light and can be thought of as photons trapped inside the pe-
riodic medium. Both eﬀects are accompanied by a huge surge in electromagnetic ﬁeld
amplitude inside the photonic crystal. But that is where their similarity ends. Indeed,
in the case of a Fabry-Perot cavity, the entire periodic stack (photonic slab) works as
a resonator in which the ”trapped photons” are spread all over the place. For this
reason, all the major characteristics of Fabry-Perot cavity resonance are essentially
dependent on the slab thickness.
If the slab thickness D = N L is too large, then
even small absorption or structural irregularity will completely smooth out the reso-
nances. So, on the one hand, the slab should have enough layers to support distinct
Fabry-Perot cavity resonances. But on the other hand, the number of layers should
not be too large so that the losses and structural irregularities would not wipe out
the eﬀect. In addition, the number of layers essentially aﬀects the resonance band-
width. By contrast, the frozen mode regime is not a resonance in a usual sense of this
word. Each trapped photon is now localized within certain small number of unit cells
depending on the pulse bandwidth, while the slab size is not essential at all. Even if
, it does not aﬀect any basic characteristics of the frozen mode regime, such
N
as the bandwidth or the frozen mode amplitude.

2.2.1. Photonic slab as a delay line In the case (19) of a thin slab, the idea of a
distinct pulse slowly propagating through the slab does not apply. On the other hand,
one might be interested in the relation between the input and the output pulses, rather
than in what is going on inside the photonic slab. This is the case, for example, if the
photonic slab is used as a delay line. Let ΨI and ΨP be the input and output pulses,
respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 6. The shape of the output pulse ΨP can be close
to that of the input pulse ΨI regardless of whether or not the condition (19) is met.
If the shape of the pulse is indeed preserved, one can deﬁne the ”eﬀective speed” ˜u of
pulse propagation through the slab as

˜u =

D
˜t

,

(32)

where ˜t is the transit time of the pulse passed through the slab. The quantity ˜u is
referred to as the group delay. The transit time determines the pulse delay due to the
presence of the slab. Of course, in the case (19) of a thick slab, the eﬀective speed (32)
coincides with the pulse group velocity u. But now we consider the opposite situation
(21). It turns out that under the resonance conditions, the transit time ˜t of a thin
photonic slab increases sharply, and the respective group delay ˜u can be as low as
2c, while the pulse passes through the slab with little reﬂection (see, for example,
10−
[25], and references therein). In this sense, the pulse delay can be classiﬁed as a slow
light eﬀect, although the quantity ˜u does not relate to the speed of any real pulse

Note that if the number N is large, the value (35) of the group delay is much lower
than the group velocity (29) of the propagating Bloch mode at the same frequency ω1.
The drawback, though, is that the bandwidth (31) of the Fabry-Perot cavity resonance
shrinks even faster as the number N of unit cells increases. Eqs. (35) and (31) yield
the following relation between the bandwidth ∆1 and the group delay ˜u1

Comparison of the slow light bandwidth (36) with its ”ideal” value (4) shows that
the Fabry-Perot cavity resonance in a ﬁnite periodic photonic slab has a fundamental
bandwidth disadvantage, if used as a delay line.

Note that real optical delay lines are commonly based on periodic arrays of weakly
coupled resonators, such as Fabry-Perot cavities, rather than on individual Fabry-
Perot cavities (see, for example, [18, 19, 20, 21, 22] and references therein).

In conclusion, let us reiterate that in the cases other than (19), there is no a
distinct pulse propagating inside the periodic medium and, therefore, the notion of
slow light does not literally apply there. Further in this paper we assume that the
condition (19) is satisﬁed, warranting the approximation of a semi-inﬁnite photonic
crystal. This allows us to investigate the slow light phenomenon in its ”pure” form,
when it is directly related to the speed of electromagnetic pulse propagating through
the medium. In this case, the frozen mode regime associated with stationary inﬂection
point (15) provides a unique possibility of converting a signiﬁcant fraction of the
incident light into a coherent mode with extremely low group velocity and drastically
enhanced amplitude.

3. Slow light in periodic layered media

From now on we restrict ourselves to stratiﬁed media, which are periodic stacks of
dielectric layers. Such systems are also referred to as photonic crystals with one
dimensional periodicity. A major reason for such a choice is that the electrodynamics
of stratiﬁed media can be done within the framework of a rigorous analytical approach.
This is particularly important since the frozen mode regime involves some unique and

Slow light in photonic crystals

17

spectacular behavior, so it would be desirable to be sure that such a behavior is not a
numerical artifact. As soon as we assume that the semi-inﬁnite photonic slab in Fig.
2 is a periodic array of plane-parallel uniform layers, we can give much more detailed
and meaningful description of the frozen mode regime.

We start with some general remarks about electromagnetic eigenmodes in periodic
layered media. Then we proceed to a semi-qualitative description of the situation
taking place at diﬀerent stationary points of the dispersion relations. A consistent
and complete analysis based on the Maxwell equations will be presented in Sections
5 through 12.

3.1. Propagating and evanescent eigenmodes in periodic stacks of anisotropic layers

Let ΨI (z), ΨR (z) and ΨT (z) denote the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves,
respectively, as shown in Fig. 2. In frequency domain, each of these waves can be
explicitly represented by a column vector

Ψ (z) = 

Ex (z)
Ey (z)
Hx (z)
Hy (z)



,









(37)

where Ex (z) , Ey (z) , Hx (z) , Hy (z) are the transverse components of electromagnetic
ﬁeld. The exact deﬁnition of Ψ (z) is given in (80) and (81). The incident and reﬂected
beams are plane monochromatic waves propagating in vacuum, while the transmitted
electromagnetic ﬁeld ΨT (z) inside the periodic layered medium is not a single Bloch
eigenmode. At the slab boundary at z = 0, the three waves satisfy the standard
boundary condition

ΨI (0) + ΨR (0) = ΨT (0) ,

(38)

implying continuity of the tangential ﬁeld components (37). Note that periodic stacks
capable of supporting the frozen mode regime must include anisotropic layers with
misaligned and/or oblique orientation of the principal axes. As a consequence, the
reﬂected and transmitted waves in Fig. 2 will have some elliptic polarization even if
the incident wave is linearly polarized.

In the setting of Fig. 2 where the semi-inﬁnite periodic layered array occupies
the half-space z
0, the transmitted wave ΨT (z) is a superposition of two Bloch
components (Bloch eigenmodes) with diﬀerent polarizations and diﬀerent values of
the Bloch wave number k. There are three possibilities.

≥

(i) Both Bloch components of the transmitted wave ΨT are propagating modes

ΨT (z) = Ψpr1 (z) + Ψpr2 (z) , z

0,

(39)

which means that the two respective values of k are real. For example, at
ωb < ω < ωa in Fig. 1, the transmitted wave ΨT is composed of two Bloch
eigenmodes with two diﬀerent real wave numbers k1 and k2 and two diﬀerent
group velocities u1 > 0 and u2 > 0. This constitutes the phenomenon of double
refraction.

(ii) Both Bloch components of ΨT are evanescent

ΨT (z) = Ψev1 (z) + Ψev2 (z) , z

0,

(40)

≥

≥

Slow light in photonic crystals

18

which implies that the two respective values of k are complex with Im k > 0. For
example, this is the case when the frequency ω falls into the photonic band gap
at ω > ωg in Fig. 1. The fact that Im k > 0 implies that the wave amplitude
decays as the distance z from the semi-inﬁnite slab surface increases. In the case
(40), the incident wave is totally reﬂected back to space by the semi-inﬁnite slab,
as seen in Fig. 3.

(iii) Of particular interest is the case where one of the Bloch components of the
transmitted wave ΨT is a propagating mode with u > 0, while the other is an
evanescent mode with Im k > 0

ΨT (z) = Ψpr (z) + Ψev (z) , z

0.

≥

For example, this is the case at the frequency range

ωa < ω < ωg

(41)

(42)

in Fig. 1. As the distance z from the slab/vacuum interface increases, the
evanescent contribution Ψev in (41) decays as exp (
z Im k), and the resulting
transmitted wave ΨT turns into a single propagating Bloch mode Ψpr.

−

Propagating modes with u < 0, as well as evanescent modes with Im k < 0, never
contribute to the transmitted wave ΨT inside the semi-inﬁnite stack in Fig. 2. This
fact is based on the following two assumptions:

- The transmitted wave ΨT and the reﬂected wave ΨR are originated from the
plane monochromatic wave ΨI incident on the semi-inﬁnite photonic slab from
the left, as shown in Fig. 2.

- The layered array in Fig. 2 occupies the entire half-space and is perfectly periodic

at z > 0.

If either of the above conditions is violated, the ﬁeld ΨT inside the periodic stack
can be a superposition of four Bloch eigenmodes with either sign of the group velocity
u of propagating contributions, or either sign of Im k of evanescent contributions. For
example, this would be the case if the periodic layered array in Fig. 2 had some kind
of structural defects or a ﬁnite thickness like that presented in Fig. 6.

The propagating modes with u > 0 and evanescent modes with Im k > 0 are
referred to as the forward waves. Only forward modes contribute to the transmitted
wave ΨT (z) in the case of a periodic semi-inﬁnite stack. The propagating modes with
u < 0 and evanescent modes with Im k < 0 are referred to as the backward waves.
Since the backward Bloch waves are not excited in the setting of Fig. 2, they play no
role in further consideration.

In all three cases (39 – 40), the contribution of a particular Bloch eigenmode to
the transmitted wave ΨT depends on polarization ΨI of the incident wave. One can
always choose the incident wave polarization so that only one Bloch component is
excited. In such a case, ΨT is a single Bloch eigenmode.

Only propagating modes contribute to the normal component ST of the energy
ﬂux inside periodic semi-inﬁnite slab. Evanescent modes do not participate in energy
transfer in such a case. In the important particular case of a single propagating mode
(ΨT = Ψpr), we have from (13) and (14)

ST = W u = τ SI ,

2 is the energy density associated with the transmitted propagating

The assumption that the transmitted wave ΨT (z) is a superposition of
propagating and/or evanescent Bloch eigenmodes may not be valid at stationary
points (12) of electromagnetic dispersion relation ω (k), because each stationary point
is a degeneracy point of the frequency spectrum. For example, if the frequency ω
exactly coincides with stationary inﬂection point (15), the transmitted wave ΨT (z)
is dominated by a (non-Bloch) Floquet eigenmode linearly diverging with z, which
constitutes the frozen mode regime[28, 29]. At all other frequencies, the transmitted
wave is a superposition of two forward Bloch modes, each of which can be either
propagating or evanescent. A detailed analysis of this and related phenomena is
presented further in this paper.

Knowing the eigenmode composition of the transmitted wave ΨT (z) we can give
a semi-qualitative description of what happens when the frequency ω of the incident
wave approaches one of the stationary points (12) in Fig. 1. A complete analysis
based on the Maxwell equations will be presented later in the paper.

3.2. Photonic band edge

We start with the simplest case of a photonic band edge. Just below the band edge
frequency ωg in Fig. 1, the transmitted ﬁeld ΨT (z) is a superposition (41) of one
propagating and one evanescent Bloch components. Due to the boundary condition
(38) at the slab/vacuum interface, the amplitude of the transmitted wave at z = 0 is
comparable with that of the incident wave. In the case of a generic polarization of the
incident light, the amplitudes of the propagating and evanescent Bloch components
at z = 0 are also comparable to each other and to the amplitude of the incident light

As the distance z from the slab surface increases, the evanescent component Ψev (z)
decays rapidly, while the amplitude of the propagating component remains constant.
Eventually, at a certain distance from the slab surface, the transmitted wave ΨT (z)
becomes very close to its propagating Bloch component

The evanescent component Ψev of the transmitted wave does not display any

ω > ωg, the propagating mode turns into another evanescent mode in (40).

The relation (49) is illustrated by the numerical example in Fig. 3.

The equations (47) and (49) express the well-known fact that in the vicinity
of electromagnetic band edge, the semi-inﬁnite photonic crystal becomes totally
reﬂective, as illustrated in Fig. 3. This implies that as ω
ωg, only an inﬁnitesimal
fraction of the incident light energy is converted into the slow mode.

→

3.3. Other extreme points of spectral branches

For speciﬁcity, let us consider the stationary point a of the dispersion relation in Fig.
1, which qualitatively is not diﬀerent from the point b. At frequencies right below
ωa , the transmitted wave ΨT is a superposition (39) of two propagating eigenmodes,
one of which is the slow mode and the other is a regular forward propagating mode.
The slow mode develops a singularity at ω = ωa similar to that of the respective
slow mode in the vicinity of the band edge frequency ωg, while the other propagating
mode (the fast mode) remains regular in the vicinity of ωa and does not produce
any anomaly. The two forward modes contribute additively to the energy ﬂux ST ,
but the contribution of the fast mode remains regular in the vicinity of ωa, while the
contribution of the slow mode shows the same singular behavior as that described by
Eqs. (47) and (49). Fig. 3 provides a graphic illustration of such a behavior.

The important point is that similar to the situation in the vicinity of a photonic
band edge, at ω = ωa and ω = ωb the contribution of the respective slow mode to the
transmitted wave ΨT vanishes. In other words, in terms of slow mode excitation, the
stationary points a and b in Fig. 1 are no diﬀerent from the band edge g.

3.4. Stationary inﬂection point: the frozen mode regime

A sharply diﬀerent situation develops in the vicinity of a stationary inﬂection point
(15) of the dispersion relation (point 0 in Fig. 1). According to (15), the dispersion
relation in the vicinity of ω0 can be approximated as follows

where SI is the ﬁxed energy ﬂux of the incident wave. The slab transmittance τ
remains ﬁnite even at ω = ω0, as illustrated in Fig. 3. As a result, the energy ﬂux
(43) associated with the transmitted frozen mode also remains ﬁnite and can even
be close to unity in the vicinity of ω0. The latter implies that the incident light is
completely converted to the frozen mode with inﬁnitesimal group velocity (51) and
diverging energy density (52).

Let us consider the structure of the frozen mode. At ω

ω0, the transmitted
wave ΨT is a superposition (41) of one propagating and one evanescent Bloch
components. In contrast to the case of a photonic band edge, in the vicinity of ω0 both
Bloch components of ΨT develop strong singularity. Speciﬁcally, as the frequency ω
approaches ω0, both contributions grow sharply, while remaining nearly equal and
opposite in sign at the slab boundary

while the amplitude of the propagating component Ψpr remains constant and very
large. As a consequence, the amplitude of the resulting transmitted wave ΨT (z)
sharply increases with the distance z from the slab boundary and, eventually, reaches
its large saturation value corresponding to the propagating component Ψpr, as
illustrated in Fig. 9.

If the frequency ω of incident light is exactly equal to the frozen mode frequency
ω0, the transmitted wave ΨT (z) does not reduce to the sum (41) of propagating
and evanescent contributions [28, 29]. Instead, it corresponds to a non-Bloch Floquet
eigenmode diverging linearly with z

provides an ideal and unique situation in terms of slow mode excitation. Indeed, in
this case virtually all the incident light energy can be converted into the slow mode
with greatly enlaced amplitude.

A consistent mathematical analysis of the frozen mode regime is rather
sophisticated and will take a great deal of our attention further in this paper.
Speciﬁcally, the fundamental fact that at ω = ω0, the energy ﬂux of the frozen mode
remains ﬁnite in spite of vanishing group velocity, is rigorously proven in Section 9
(see Eqs. (421) through (449) and related explanations).

3.5. Degenerate band edge

While the situation with the regular band edge appears quite obvious and not
particularly interesting from the perspective of slow light, the so-called degenerate
band edge proves to be quite diﬀerent. An example of electromagnetic dispersion
relation with degenerate band edge is shown in Fig. 10.

Similarly to the regular band edge, below the degenerate band edge frequency ωd, the
transmitted ﬁeld ΨT is a superposition (41) of one propagating and one evanescent
components, while above ωd, the transmitted wave is a combination (40) of two
evanescent components. The critical diﬀerence though is that now the both Bloch
components display strong singularity. Speciﬁcally, as the frequency ω approaches ωd,
both Bloch contributions grow sharply, while remaining nearly equal and opposite in
sign at the slab boundary

The destructive interference (55) ensures that the boundary condition (38) are
satisﬁed, while both Bloch contributions to ΨT (z) diverge. As the distance z from
the slab boundary increases, the evanescent component Ψev (z) dies out, while the
propagating component Ψpr (z) remains huge. Eventually, at z
L, the resulting
transmitted wave ΨT (z) coincides with the propagating Bloch eigenmode Ψpr (z). If
the frequency ω of incident light is exactly equal to ωd, the transmitted wave ΨT (z)
does not reduce to the sum (41) of propagating and evanescent contributions. Instead,
it corresponds to a non-Bloch Floquet eigenmode diverging linearly with z

The above behavior appears to be very similar to that of the frozen mode regime
described in the previous subsection. In both cases, the Figs. 8 and 9 provide a good
graphic illustration of the electromagnetic ﬁeld distribution inside the slab in the
vicinity of the respective stationary point. Yet, there is a crucial diﬀerence between
the two cases. In spite of its huge diverging amplitude (55), the transmitted wave ΨT
does not provide any energy ﬂux in close proximity of a degenerate band edge. Indeed,
according to (55), as ω approaches ωd, the energy density W of the transmitted wave
diverges as

By contrast, in the case of the frozen mode regime the slab transmittance remains
ﬁnite and a signiﬁcant fraction of the incident light energy goes to the slow mode.

The situation at degenerate band edge can be viewed as an intermediate between
the frozen mode regime and the vicinity of a regular band edge. Indeed, on the one
hand, the incident wave at ω = ωd is totally reﬂected back to space, as would be the
case at a regular band edge. On the other hand, the transmitted ﬁeld amplitude inside

ωd can be very attractive
for a variety of practical applications, although such a behavior cannot be qualiﬁed as
a slow light case.

4. Physical conditions for the frozen mode regime in layered media

The frozen mode regime is associated with stationary inﬂection point (15) of the
electromagnetic dispersion relation. Leaving the proof of this statement to the

Slow light in photonic crystals

25

following sections, here we establish the conditions under which the dispersion relation
of a periodic layered array can develop the singularity (15). We will see that only
special layered structures incorporating anisotropic layers can display this property.
In the following sections, based on the Maxwell equations, we will show that indeed
the stationary inﬂection point (15) is uniquely associated with the frozen mode regime.

4.1. Axial dispersion relation: basic deﬁnitions

We start with generalization of the frozen mode concept to the case of oblique light
incidence.

Consider a monochromatic plane wave obliquely incident on a periodic semi-
inﬁnite stack, as shown in Fig. 2. Let ΨI , ΨR and ΨT denote the incident, reﬂected
and transmitted waves, respectively. Due to the boundary conditions (38), all three
waves ΨI, ΨR and ΨT must be assigned the same pair of tangential components
kx, ky of the respective wave vector [2]

while their axial (normal) components kz can be diﬀerent. Hereinafter, the normal
component of the transmitted Bloch waves propagating inside the periodic layered
medium will be referred as the wave number and denoted by symbol k, rather than
kz

Inside periodic stack (at z > 0):

~k = (kx, ky, k) .

Unlike kx and ky, the z component k of the Bloch wave vector (57) is deﬁned up to a
multiple of 2π/L

k

k + 2πN/L,

≡

where L is the period of the layered structure and N is an integer. For given kx, ky
and ω, the value k is found by solving the time-harmonic Maxwell equations (79)
in periodic medium, that will be done in the following sections. The result can be
represented as the axial dispersion relation, which gives the correspondence between
ω and k at ﬁxed kx, ky

ω = ω (k) , at ﬁxed kx, ky.

It can be more convenient to deﬁne the axial dispersion relation as the correspondence
between ω and k at ﬁxed direction ~n of incident light propagation

ω = ω (k) , at ﬁxed nx, ny,

where the unit vector ~n can be expressed in terms of the tangential components (56)

~k = ~k0. The spectral singularity (62) is called the axial stationary inﬂection point.

One can also use another deﬁnition of axial stationary inﬂection point (62), which

is based on the axial dispersion relation (60) rather than (59)

at ω = ω0 and ~n = ~n0:

∂ω

The partial derivatives in (65) are taken at constant (nx, ny), rather than at constant
(kx, ky). Both deﬁnitions (62) and (65) are equivalent to each other. In the particular
case ~n

equivalently, (65) turns into a regular stationary inﬂection point (15).

The axial frozen mode regime associated with singularity (62) is very similar to
its particular case, the regular frozen mode regime, related to the regular stationary
inﬂection point (15). Speciﬁcally, under the axial frozen mode regime, obliquely
incident light can enter the semi-inﬁnite photonic crystal with little reﬂection, where
it is completely converted into a coherent mode with inﬁnitesimal normal component
(63) of the group velocity and drastically enhanced amplitude. The energy density
of the axial frozen mode displays the same resonance-like behavior (52). The only
diﬀerence between the axial and the regular frozen mode regime is that in the former
case, the tangential component (64) of the group velocity remains ﬁnite at ω = ω0.
The speciﬁcity of the axial frozen mode regime as compared to the regular one is
discussed in [28]. Further in this paper we will focus exclusively on the common
features of these two cases. Either of them will be referred to simply as the frozen
mode regime.

4.2. Spectral asymmetry in periodic stacks

The (axial) stationary inﬂection point is indeed associated with the frozen mode
regime. But not every periodic layered media can display such a spectral singularity.
It turns out that a necessary condition for the existence of (axial) stationary inﬂection
point and, therefore, a necessary condition for the frozen mode regime is the following
property of the electromagnetic dispersion relation of the periodic stack

ω (kx, ky, k)

= ω (kx, ky,

k) or, equivalently, ω (nx, ny, k)

= ω (nx, ny,

k)

(66)

−

−

The property (66) is referred to as the axial spectral asymmetry. Further in this
paper, we will use the simpliﬁed notation (59) for the axial dispersion relation. In this
notation, the requirement (66) of the axial spectral asymmetry takes the following
form

ω (k)

= ω (

k) ,

(67)

Slow light in photonic crystals

where k is the z component (58) of the Bloch wave vector ~k. Hereinafter, the quantity
k will be referred to as the Bloch wave number. A robust frozen mode regime only
occurs if the degree of spectral asymmetry (67) is signiﬁcant.

In the particular case of normal wave propagation, the requirement (66) of axial

spectral asymmetry reduces to

(cid:16)
This kind of asymmetric dispersion relation can only occur in periodic stacks with
some of the layers being magnetic and displaying nonreciprocal Faraday rotation
[36, 28]. Signiﬁcant spectral asymmetry requires strong Faraday rotation. The
simplest periodic array supporting the spectral asymmetry (68) is shown in Fig. 11.

Figure 11. A simplest periodic stack supporting asymmetric dispersion relation
(68). A unit cell L of this stack comprises three layers: two anisotropic layers 1
and 2 with misaligned in-plain anisotropy (the A - layers), and one magnetic layer
F with magnetization shown by the arrows.

At microwave frequencies, there exist a number of magnetic materials displaying
low losses and strong Faraday rotation. But, at infrared and optical frequencies, the
magnetic materials with suﬃciently strong Faraday rotation are usually too lossy for
our purposes. Therefore, if we are interested in optical frequencies, we have to rely on
non-magnetic stacks, in which the regular spectral asymmetry (68) is impossible. By
contrast, the axial spectral asymmetry (66) or (67) does not require magnetic layers
and can occur even in perfectly reciprocal non-magnetic stacks.

The physical conditions under which the electromagnetic dispersion relation of a
non-magnetic layered structure can develop the (axial) spectral asymmetry (67) and,
thereby, support the (axial) frozen mode regime can be grouped in two categories. The

6
Slow light in photonic crystals

28

ﬁrst one comprises several symmetry restrictions. The second category includes some
basic qualitative recommendations which would ensure the robustness of the frozen
mode regime, provided that the symmetry conditions for the regime are met. In what
follows we brieﬂy describe those conditions and then show how they apply to periodic
stacks incorporating some real dielectric materials.

There are two fundamental necessary conditions for the ”non-magnetic” frozen
in the periodic

mode regime. The ﬁrst one is that the Bloch dispersion relation ω

layered medium must display the axial spectral asymmetry (67). This condition
is necessary for the existence of the axial stationary inﬂection point (62) in the
electromagnetic dispersion relation of an arbitrary periodic layered medium. The
second necessary condition is that for the given direction ~k of wave propagation, the
Bloch eigenmodes Ψ~k with diﬀerent polarizations must have the same symmetry. In
the case of oblique propagation in periodic layered media, the latter condition implies
that for the given ~k, the Bloch eigenmodes are neither TE nor TM

(cid:17)

~k
(cid:16)

Ψ~k is neither TE nor TM.

(69)

The condition (67) imposes certain restrictions on (i) the point symmetry group
G of the periodic layered array and (ii) on the direction ~k of the transmitted wave
propagation inside the layered medium. While the condition (69) may impose some
additional restriction on the direction of ~k.

The restriction on the symmetry of the periodic stack stemming from the

requirement (67) of the axial spectral asymmetry is

mz /
∈

G and 2z /
∈

G.

where mz is the mirror plane parallel to the layers, 2z is the 2-fold rotation about
the z axis. An immediate consequence of the criterion (70) is that least one of the
alternating layers of the periodic stack must be an anisotropic dielectric material with
nonzero εxz and/or εyz, where the z direction is normal to the layers

= 0

and/or

εxz 6

= 0

εyz 6

Otherwise, the operation 2z will be present in the symmetry group G of the periodic
stack.

The simplest and the most practical example of a non-magnetic periodic stack
satisfying the criterion (70) is shown in Fig. 12. It is made up of anisotropic A layers
alternated with isotropic B layers. The respective dielectric permittivity tensors are

If all the above necessary conditions are met, then the (axial) frozen mode regime
is, at least, not forbidden by symmetry. More details on the symmetry aspects of the
frozen mode regime can be found in [29], Section II and [28], Sections I and II.

In practice, as soon as the symmetry conditions are met, one can almost certainly
achieve the (axial) frozen mode regime at any desirable frequency ω within certain
frequency range. The frequency range is determined by the layers thicknesses and the
dielectric materials used, while a speciﬁc value of ω within the range can be selected
by the direction ~n of the light incidence. The problem is that unless the physical
parameters of the stack layers lie within a certain range, the eﬀects associated with
the frozen mode regime can be insigniﬁcant or even practically undetectable. The
basic guiding principle in choosing appropriate layer materials are discussed in Ref.
[29, 30].

The biggest challenge at optical frequencies poses the fact that the most of
the commercially available optical anisotropic crystals are not ”anisotropic enough”.
According to [29], this would push the axial stationary inﬂection point (62) very close
to the photonic band edge and make the photonic crystal almost 100% reﬂective.
This indeed would be the case if we tried to realize the frozen mode regime at the

Slow light in photonic crystals

30

lowest frequency band. But, in Ref. [30] it was shown that the above problem can be
successfully solved by moving to a higher frequency band. So, a robust axially frozen
mode regime with almost complete conversion of the incident light into the frozen
mode can be achieved with the commercially available anisotropic dielectric materials
such as N bLiO3, Y V O4, etc.

5. Electrodynamics of lossless stratiﬁed media

This section starts with a description of some basic electrodynamic properties of
stratiﬁed media composed of lossless anisotropic layers. Then we turn to the important
particular case of unbounded periodic layered arrays (periodic stacks), where the
electromagnetic eigenmodes are Bloch waves. Then we consider the problem of
electromagnetic energy ﬂux in lossless stratiﬁed media. Finally, we outline the
electromagnetic scattering problem for a semi-inﬁnite photonic slab. The material
presented in this section is suﬃcient to carry out a numerical analysis of slow light
phenomena in periodic layered media. This approach was used in [28, 29, 30] to
analyze the frozen mode regime in magnetic and non-magnetic periodic stacks. Yet,
to develop a consistent analytical picture of the frozen mode regime we will need a
more sophisticated mathematical framework based on a perturbation theory for non-
diagonalizable degenerate matrices. This problem will be addressed in the following
sections.

material tensors ˆε (~r) and ˆµ (~r) are Hermitian

In lossless media:

In lossless non-magnetic media:

where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate and the subscript T denotes the
matrix transposition. In magnetically polarized lossless media, the Hermitian material
tensors (77) may have a skew-symmetric imaginary part which is responsible for the
non-reciprocal eﬀect of Faraday rotation [2].

In a stratiﬁed medium, the second rank tensors ˆε (~r) and ˆµ (~r) depend on a single

Cartesian coordinate z, and the Maxwell equations (75) can be recast as

1 (z0, z) , T (z, z) = I,

(89)

where I is the identity matrix. The transfer matrix T (z, z0) allows to ﬁnd the time-
harmonic electromagnetic ﬁeld Ψ (z) at an arbitrary point z of the stratiﬁed medium
knowing its value Ψ (z0) at any particular point z0.

The matrix T (z, z0) itself is uniquely deﬁned by the following Cauchy problem

∂zT (z, z0) = i

M (z) T (z, z0) , T (z, z) = I.

imply that the transfer matrix T (z, z0) is J - unitary

5.2.1. The transfer matrix of a stack of uniform layers The greatest advantage of
the transfer matrix approach stems from the fact that the transfer matrix TS of an
arbitrary stack of layers is a sequential product of the transfer matrices Tm of the
constitutive layers

TS =

Tm.

m
Y
According to Eq. (90), if the individual layers m are homogeneous, the corresponding
single-layer transfer matrices Tm can be explicitly expressed in terms of the respective
Maxwell operators Mm

Tm = exp (izmMm) ,

where zm is the thickness of the m-th layer. The explicit expression for the Maxwell
operator Mm of an arbitrary uniform layer of anisotropic dielectric material is given
by Eq. (83). Thus, Eq. (94), together with (95) and (83), give an explicit expression
for the transfer matrix TS of an arbitrary stack of anisotropic dielectric layers. The
elements of the J - unitary matrix TS are functions of:

- the material tensors ˆε and ˆµ in each layer of the stack,
- the layer thicknesses dm,
- the frequency ω,
- the tangential components kx = ω

ky = ω

c nx,

In the case of kx = ky = 0, we have instead of Eq. (93)

c ny of the wave vector.

if kx = ky = 0, det TS = 1,

(96)

that can be derived directly from Eqs. (95) and (83).

5.3. Periodic layered arrays. Bloch eigenmodes.

In a periodic layered media, all material tensors are periodic functions of z

ˆε (z) = ˆε (z + L) , ˆµ (z) = ˆµ (z + L) ,

and so is the Maxwell operator M (z) in Eq. (81),

M (z + L) = M (z) ,

where L is the length of a unit cell of the periodic stack. By deﬁnition, Bloch solutions
Ψk (z) of the reduced Maxwell equation (81) with the periodic operator M (z) satisfy

Ψk (z + L) = eikLΨk (z) ,

where k is the normal component of the Bloch wave vector

33

(94)

(95)

(97)

(98)

(99)

Unlike kx and ky, the z component (99) of the Bloch wave vector is deﬁned up to a
multiple of 2π/L

k = kz.

≡

Slow light in photonic crystals

where N is an integer. Hereinafter, the normal component kz of the Bloch wave vector
will be referred to simply as the wave number and denoted with symbol k, rather than
kz.

The deﬁnition (88) of the T - matrix together with Eq. (98) give

Ψk (z + L) = T (z + L, z) Ψk (z) = eikLΨk (z) .

Introducing the transfer matrix of a primitive cell

TL = T (L, 0)

we have from Eq. (100)

TLΦk = eikLΦk, where Φk = Ψk (0) .

Thus, the eigenvectors of the transfer matrix TL of the unit cell are uniquely related
to the eigenmodes Ψk (z) of the reduced Maxwell equation (81) through the relations

The respective four eigenvalues

Φi = Ψi (0) , i = 1, 2, 3, 4.

5.4. Symmetry of the dispersion relation

Below we will see that the dispersion relation symmetry with respect to the sign of
the wave number k depends on whether or not the transfer matrix TL is similar to its
inverse. Indeed, assume that

(116)

{

Let us consider the symmetry relation (116) in more detail. Assume that k1 = k∗1
is a real wave number corresponding to a propagating eigenmode. The relation (116)
implies that for given ω and kx, ky, there is another real wave number k2 = k∗2 such
that

In terms of the (axial) dispersion relation ω (k), the Eq. (117) boils down to a simple
deﬁnition of axial spectral symmetry

where k1 = k and k2 =

an additional pair k3 and k4 =

k3 of reciprocal wave numbers.

Now assume that while k1 and k2 =

k1 are real, the remaining wave numbers
−
k3 and k4 from the set (116) are complex, which constitute the case (109) of two
propagating and two evanescent eigenmodes. In such a case, in addition to Eq. (117),
the relation (116) together with (106) yield

Consider now the case (111) of a frequency gap, where all four eigenmodes are

5.5. Electromagnetic energy ﬂux in stratiﬁed media

5.5.1. The J - scalar product For future references, consider the following scalar
product involving the J - matrix (86)

(Ψ1, JΨ2) = E∗1xH2y −

E∗1yH2x + H ∗1,yE2x −

H ∗1xE2y,

which will be referred to as the J - scalar product. Given the importance of the above
quantity, hereinafter, we will use the following special notation for it

[Ψ1, Ψ2]

(Ψ1, JΨ2) .

≡

(125)

The J - scalar product (125) is invariant under the following transformation involving
an arbitrary J - unitary matrix T

[T Ψ1, T Ψ2] = [Ψ1, Ψ2]

for any Ψ1and Ψ2.

(126)

The relation (126) can also be viewed as a criterion of J - unitarity of a matrix T .
This relation is similar to that involving the regular scalar product (Ψ1, Ψ2) and a
unitary matrix U

(U Ψ1, U Ψ2) = (Ψ1, Ψ2)

for any Ψ1and Ψ2.

Slow light in photonic crystals

37

Let Ψi (z) and Ψj (z) be two arbitrary solutions of the time-harmonic maxwell
equation (81). The equality (126) together with the deﬁnition (88) of the transfer
matrix yield

[Ψ (z)i , Ψj (z)] = [T (z, 0) Ψ (0)i , T (z, 0) Ψj (0)] = [Ψ (0)i , Ψj (0)] ,

(127)

which implies that the J - scalar product [Ψ (z)i , Ψj (z)] does not depend on the
coordinate z.

Consider now the J - scalar product

(133)

(135)

[Φi, Φj]

of two eigenvectors Φi and Φj of the transfer matrix TL

TLΦi = ζ iΦi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4.

The J - unitarity (126) of TL implies that

[TLΦi, TLΦj] = ζ∗i ζ j [Φi, Φj] = [Φi, Φj] ,

which, in turn, yields the following important relation

or equivalently,

In particular

[Φi, Φj] = 0,

if ζ∗i ζ j 6

= 1,

[Φi, Φj] = 0,

if kj 6

= k∗i .

[Φi, Φi]

= 0, only if ki = k∗i ,

which means that Φi in (133) should be a propagating Bloch mode.

5.5.2. Energy ﬂux in stratiﬁed media The real-valued energy ﬂux (the Poynting

tangential coordinates x and y. A simple energy conservation argument shows that
the normal component Sz of the energy ﬂux does not depend on the coordinate z
either, while the tangential components Sx and Sy may depend on z. Indeed, in a
lossless stratiﬁed medium we have, with consideration for Eq. (135)

S (~r) = ∂zSz (z) = 0,

Hereinafter, the normal component of the energy ﬂux will be referred to simply

rather than Sz.

The explicit expression for the normal component of the energy ﬂux (135) can be

recast as

transfer matrix. Indeed, from the deﬁnition (88) of the transfer matrix we have

Ψ (z) = T (z, 0) Ψ (0) = T (z, 0) Φ.

(140)

Plugging Eq. (140) into (138) yields

S =

[Ψ (z) , Ψ (z)] =

[T (z, 0) Φ, T (z, 0) Φ] .

Taking into account the property (126) of a J - unitary matrix, we again arrive at Eq.
(139).

5.5.3. Energy ﬂux in periodic stratiﬁed media The direct relation (139) between
the J - scalar product [Ψ, Ψ] and the energy ﬂux S at ﬁxed ω and kx, ky allows us
to make some strong statements regarding electromagnetic energy ﬂux in periodic
layered media.

Let us start with the simplest case of a single Bloch eigenmode. Eq.

(139)
together with (133) show that only a propagating mode can transfer electromagnetic
energy

Si =

[Φi, Φi]

= 0 only if ki = k∗i .

A single evanescent eigenmode always has zero energy ﬂux

Si = [Φi, Φi] = 0,

if ki 6

= k∗i .

Let us turn to the case of a superposition

(141)

(142)

of diﬀerent Bloch eigenmodes with ﬁxed ω and kx, ky. In such a case, the energy ﬂux
is

S =

2) The contribution of evanescent Bloch eigenmodes to the energy ﬂux depends on

their number.

(a) In the case (109) of two evanescent modes Φ3 and Φ4 we have

S = Re (a∗3a4 [Φ3, Φ4]) , where k4 = k∗3,

(145)

which implies that only a pair of evanescent modes with conjugate wave
numbers can produce energy ﬂux. The respective contribution (145) is
independent of the presence of propagating modes Φ1 and Φ2. In accordance
with Eq. (142), a single evanescent mode, either Φ3 or Φ4, does not produce
energy ﬂux on its own.

(b) In the case (111) of four evanescent modes we have

S = Re (a∗1a2 [Φ1, Φ2]) + Re (a∗3a4 [Φ3, Φ4]) , where k2 = k∗1, k4 = k∗3, (146)

which implies that either of the two pairs of evanescent modes with conjugate
wave numbers contribute to the energy ﬂux independently of each other.

5.6. Scattering problem for periodic semi-inﬁnite stack

In this ﬁnal subsection we outline the standard procedure we use for solving the
scattering problem of a plane monochromatic wave incident on the surface of a periodic
semi-inﬁnite stack.

In vacuum (to the left of the semi-inﬁnite slab) the electromagnetic ﬁeld ΨV (z)

is a superposition of the incident and reﬂected waves

ΨV (z) = ΨI (z) + ΨR (z) , z

0,

≤

where the indices I and R relate to the incident and reﬂected beams, respectively. At
the slab boundary we have

ΨV (0) = ΨI (0) + ΨR (0) .

The transmitted wave ΨT (z) inside periodic semi-inﬁnite slab is a superposition

of two forward Bloch eigenmodes

ΨT (z) = Ψ1 (z) + Ψ2 (z) , z

0.

≥

The eigenmodes Ψ1 (z) and Ψ2 (z) can be both propagating (with u > 0), one
propagating and one evanescent (with u > 0 and Im k > 0, respectively), or both
evanescent (with Im k > 0), depending on which of the three cases (39), (41), or (40)
we are dealing with.

(147)

(148)

Slow light in photonic crystals

Assume now that for a given frequency ω, the Bloch eigenmodes are found, which
can be readily done in our case of a periodic layered array. Using the standard
electromagnetic boundary conditions

ΨT (0) = ΨI (0) + ΨR (0) ,

(150)

one can express the reﬂected wave ΨR and the eigenmode composition of the
transmitted wave ΨT , in terms of the amplitude and polarization of the incident wave
ΨI . This automatically gives us the electromagnetic ﬁeld distribution ΨT (z) inside
the slab, as a function of the incident wave frequency, polarization, and direction of
incidence.

6. Matrix of reﬂection coeﬃcients of a semi-inﬁnite periodic stack

This and the following sections are devoted to a rigorous mathematical analysis of the
scattering problem for a plane monochromatic wave incident on a periodic semi-inﬁnite
stack. Our prime focus is on the vicinity of stationary points of the electromagnetic
dispersion relation. The goal is to develop an asymptotic analytical description of
the frozen mode regime. Not only will it allow us to rigorously prove the physical
results presented earlier in this paper, it will also give us a better understanding of
the very essence of the frozen mode regime. The major part of the following analysis
is a perturbation theory of degenerate non-diagonalizable matrices. Speciﬁcally, we
refer to the transfer matrix TL, which develops a nontrivial Jordan block at any
stationary point of the dispersion relations. The latter circumstance implies the
existence of diverging non-Bloch eigenmodes, which usually do not contribute to the
transmitted wave ΨT inside the semi-inﬁnite photonic slab and, therefore, do not
aﬀect the scattering problem at hand. Yet, there are two important exceptions. The
ﬁrst one is the stationary inﬂection point (15), where not only the linearly diverging
Floquet eigenmode dominates the transmitted wave, but it also produces a ﬁnite
energy ﬂux inside the periodic medium. Another exception is the degenerate band
edge (54), where the respective linearly divergent non-Bloch eigenmode, although
dominant, does not contribute to the energy ﬂux and, therefore, does not eﬀectively
transform the incident radiation into the slow mode.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

In this section we re-formulate
the scattering problem for a lossless periodic semi-inﬁnite stack, introducing basic
notations and deﬁnitions. In the following sections we develop a perturbation theory
for degenerate non-diagonalizable 4
4 matrices and apply this theory to the transfer
matrix TL and, thereby, to the scattering problem. Special attention is given to
the comparative analysis of diﬀerent stationary points of electromagnetic dispersion
relation, such as photonic band edge, stationary inﬂection point, and degenerate band
edge. To simplify the rather cumbersome mathematical expressions of the following
sections, we will use the following new notations for the quantities already deﬁned

A periodic semi-inﬁnite stack is deﬁned in terms of the related matrix function

The set of equalities (176) and (179) show the system of vectors Z ±j , j = 1, 2 has
a property that the both forms, namely, the EM density form (the scalar product) and
the ﬂux form, become diagonal if it is chosen to be a basis of the space C4. Another
advantage of choosing Z ±j , j = 1, 2 to be a basis is that in this basis the ﬂux balance
equality for relevant modes takes its simplest form as in the classical scattering theory
(see (214), (215), (221)). In fact, the latter is our primary motivation.

For the periodic semi-inﬁnite stack with A (x3; ω) we have the following equation

following Cauchy problem

indicates that by its very deﬁnition the modes related to ST (a; ω) must transport the
energy in the chosen direction.

It is a well known result of the spectral theory that any eigenmode Ψ (x3) can
not grow at inﬁnity faster then polynomially. In particular, an eigenmode can not

combination of eigenmodes of the inﬁnite periodic stack with the related periodic
. Consequently, such a linear combination can

. In addition to that,
not include evanescent modes growing exponentially as x3 → ∞
the above mentioned linear combination also cannot include backward propagating
eigenmodes (those with negative group velocity). Notice that, the related properties
of
(ω).
For instance, in the case when all eigenmodes are propagating and have diﬀerent wave
numbers as described by (108), the space
ST (0; ω) is the span of those two eigenvectors
Φξ1 = Φξ1 (ω) and Φξ2 = Φξ2 (ω) that have positive ﬂuxes, i.e.

ST (0; ω) can be characterized by the spectral properties of the transfer matrix

(cid:3)

(cid:2)

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

(cid:3)

In the case (110) when there are two propagating and two evanescent modes,
ST (0; ω) is the span of the two eigenvectors Φξ1 (ω), having a positive ﬂux, and Φζ (ω)
with

Φξ1, Φζ

The distance d (S1, S2) deﬁned by (196) measures the ”aperture” or ”gap” between
the subspaces S1 and S2. It has the following important property, [44], Section IV,
2, Corollary 2.6,

d (S1, S2) < 1 implies dim S1 = dim S2.

(198)

§

The property (198) implies that if the limit (195) exist then the dimension of the space
ST (0; ω0) must be 2 since dim

ST (0; ω) = 2 for ω

= ω0.

Having the energy ﬂux balance in the form (214) was our primary motivation for
choosing the vectors Z ±j , j = 1, 2 as a basis in C4. We also want to remind the vectors
Z ±j , j = 1, 2 reduce both the EM energy density (the scalar product) and the ﬂux
quadratic forms to their diagonal form as it follows from the set of equalities (176)
and (179).

7. Transfer matrix at and near a point of degeneracy

Let us recall ﬁrst the deﬁnition of degenerate points including inﬂection ones. A n -
degenerate point k0 of a dispersion relation ω (k) is deﬁned as a point at which the
following relations holds

(239)

(242)

ω′ (k0) = ω′′ (k0) = 0, ω′′′ (k0)

For the Floquet mode regime to occur at the frequency ν = 0, i.e. ω = ω0, the

Observe now that whenever we have n-degenerate point satisfying (238) with the
dispersion relation ω (k) as in (240), the transfer matrix T (0) of the transfer matrix
is always a Jordan block of the rank n. Observe also that though the ﬁnal statement
ω0 = 0, that is T (0) is always a Jordan block,
is made for a single frequency ν = ω

Slow light in photonic crystals

the conditions (238) involve not only the dispersion relation at k = k0 itself, but also
a number of its derivatives in k. In other words, the Jordan block form of the transfer
matrix T (0) is a result and a manifestation of a special pattern of behavior of the
transfer matrix T (ν) for small but ﬁnite values of the frequency ν.

In most interesting case of the inﬂection point for n = 3 the matrix W (0) is a just a
scalar. In the case n = 4 there no any W (0), and in the case of n = 2 in a generic
situation W (0) will be just a diagonal matrix.

Consequently, the basis fj, j = 0, 1, 2, 3 reducing

8. Spectral perturbation theory of the transfer matrix a point of
degeneracy

In this section we develop the spectral perturbation theory for the transfer matrix
T (ω) deﬁned by (101). This problem has been considered in [29] for a stationary
inﬂection point. For an inﬂection the essential part of the perturbation theory is
related to perturbational spectral analysis of the Jordan block of the rank 3, i.e.

D0 = D(3)

Below we extend the spectral constructions from [29] to the case of degenerate points
of the ranks 4 and 2. It turns out that as in the case of inﬂection point, which is a

Slow light in photonic crystals

degenerate point of the rank 3, the essential part of perturbational spectral analysis
is reduced an analysis of Jordan blocks of the ranks 4 and 2, i.e.

spectral properties of T0 (ν).

Notice that the characteristic equation det (T0 (ν)

ζIn) = 0 for the eigenvalues

of T0 (ν) is

ζ n
and that the matrix T0 (ν) is a companion matrix of the polynomial ζ n

We would like to point out that in the representation (310), (311) the eigenvectors
collected in the Vandermonde matrix S0 (˜ν) deﬁned by (292) are invariant under any
change of variables described by (271), (272). The dependence of the eigenvectors on
the parameters γj, j = 1, . . . , n comes through terms of proper higher powers of ´ν.

The representation (310) and (309) imply that the eigenvectors of the matrix T (ν)
(and, hence, in view of (283), of the matrix T (ν)) are the columns of the following

In this section we derive the asymptotic formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors

of for the transfer matrix T (ν) as ν = ω
−
ω0 is a degenerate point of the order 4. In this case since n = 4 the transfer matrix
(0) is a Jordan block of order 4, that follows
T
from the analysis carried out in the previous Section. It also follows from the results
4 matrix
of the mentioned analysis that the matrix T (ν) deﬁned by (249) is also 4
and

(ν) deﬁned by (242) is such that

T
Without loss of generality we assume that ω0 = ω (k0) is a point, say, of local
In the later case for
minimum of the dispersion relation ω (k) in a vicinity of k0.
ω0 > 0 and ν small there must be two propagating Bloch modes and two
ν = ω
evanescent modes. Consequently, there will be two the eigenvalues of the matrix T (ν)
with absolute 1, one eigenvalues of the absolute values lesser than 1 and one eigenvalue
with the absolute values larger than 1.

Based on (283), (310), (311), (317) and (318) we can ﬁnd the eigenvectors ej (ν) of
T (ν) corresponding to its eigenvalues θj (ν).

Recall also that the eigenvectors ej (ν), j = 0, 1, 2, 4 of the matrix T (ν) are the
S(i´ν) represented by the asymptotic equality
respective columns of the matrix S0 (˜ν) e−
(312). To use (312) we need to ﬁnd the matrix S1. Following the Appendix 2, ﬁrst
we introduce a decomposition of a square matrix W into its the diagonal component
diag (W ) and the remaining part ˚W = W
diag (W ) with zero diagonal elements, i.e.

−

W = [Wmj] = diag (W ) + ˚W , where diag (W ) = [Wmjδmj] , ˚W = W

diag (W ) ,

where δmj is the Kronecker symbol. Then we get the following expressions for the

8.3. Spectrum of the transfer matrix at a degenerate point of the order 2

In this section we derive the asymptotic formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
0 in the case when the frequency ω0
of for the transfer matrix T (ν) as ν = ω
is a degenerate point of the order 2. In this case since n = 2 the transfer matrix
(ν)
deﬁned by (242) is such that
(0) is a Jordan block of order 2, that follows from the
analysis carried out in the previous Section.

Without loss of generality we assume that ω0 = ω (k0) is a point, say, of local
In the later case for
minimum of the dispersion relation ω (k) in a vicinity of k0.
ν = ω
ω0 > 0 and ν small there must be two propagating Bloch modes associated
with the chosen branch ω (k) and two modes which are either both are propagating
or both are evanescent modes.

8.3.1. Eigenvalues of the transfer matrix Observe that it follows from (293), (310)
the eigenvalues η0 (ν), η1 (ν) of the matrix I2 + T (ν) from (283) are

η0 (ν) = 1 + √˜ν + O (˜ν) , η1 (ν) = 1

√˜ν + O (˜ν) ,

(394)

or, in view of (297),

η0 (ν) = 1 + √t1√ν + O (ν) , η1 (ν) = 1

√t1√ν + O (ν) ,

(395)

where, we remind, according to (291)

Notice, we can recast (395) as

a decomposition of a square matrix W into its the diagonal component diag (W ) and
the remaining part ˚W = W

9. Transfer matrix and the ﬂux

9.1. Transfer matrix and the ﬂux for an inﬂection point

In
The case of an inﬂection point is the case when the degeneracy index n = 3.

3 matrix and W (ν) is a 1
this case according to (249), the matrix T (ν) is a 3
matrix, i.e.
just a complex number W (ν). Let 3 matrix T (ν) be deﬁned by (249).
Let consider ﬁrst the matrix the matrix at the frequency of the frozen mode ω0, i.e.
for ν = 0:

T (0) = T0 = ζ 0 (I3 + D0) ,

= 0.

Then there exists a canonical basis f0, f1, f2 related to the matrix D such that

D3

0f2 = 0, f0 = D2

0f2, f1 = D0f2.

In fact, the basis f0, f1, f2 is not unique and is deﬁned up to some transformations.
The equalities (421) and (422) imply the following representation for T0

and the forth vector f3 is eigenvector
(0) related to the eigenvalue W (0). Evidently
the vectors f0, f1, f2 are 4-dimensional representation of respectively vectors f0, f1,
f2. Based on the above and the relations (423) we get

T

T0f0 = ζ 0f0,

T0f1 = ζ 0f1 + ζ0f0,

T0f2 = ζ0f2 + ζ 0f1,

(429)

T0f3 = W (0) f3.

(430)
T0 has just two genuine eigenvectors f0 and f3 with
In particular, the matrix
corresponding diﬀerent eigenvalues ζ 0 and W (0). The vectors f0 and f3 correspond
respectively to the values of the frozen and the only propagating modes at the origin.
The vectors f1 and f2 correspond respectively to the values of linearly and quadratically
growing Floquet modes at the origin.

Recall now that

T0 is J-unitary matrix, i.e.
T0Φ1,
T0 = J, [

T

T0Φ2] = [Φ1, Φ2] for any Φ1, Φ2.

Using (429) and (431) we obtain the following identities

T0f1] = [f0, f1 + f0] = [f0, f1] + [f0, f0] ,

[f0, f2] = [

T0f0,

T0f2] = [f0, f2 + f1] = [f0, f2] + [f0, f1] ,

readily implying that

[f0, f0] = 0, [f0, f1] = 0.

Then using (429), (431) again we get

[f1, f2] = [

T0f1,

T0f2] = [f1 + f0, f2 + f1]
= [f1, f2] + [f0, f2] + [f1, f1] + [f0, f1] .

The equalities (434) together with (435) yield

and, since [f1, f1] is a real number, we consequently have

Since f0, f1, f2, f3 is a basis in the 4-dimensional space the relations (460) imply that
Jf0 = 0, and, consequently, that f0 = 0 since evidently J is an invertible matrix.
f0 = 0 is impossible, and we must conclude that the relation (458) holds.

Since [f1, f1] is the ﬂux corresponding to the Floquet mode described by f1 the
relation (458) signiﬁes a fundamental fact that the Floquet mode described by f1 has
nonzero ﬂux.

9.2. Transfer matrix and the ﬂuxes for a degenerate point of the order 4

In the case of a degenerate point of the rank 4 the transfer matrix becomes a Jordan
block of the rank 4 and according to (269) there exists a basis fj, j = 0, 1, 2, 3 in C4
for which we have

T0f0 = ζ 0f0,

T0f1 = ζ 0f1 + ζ0f0,

T0f2 = ζ0f2 + ζ 0f1,

(466)

T0f3 = ζ0f3 + ζ 0f2.
Notice that the three equations (466) are exactly the same as the three equations (429)
for the inﬂection point. Hence, the identities (450)-(453) in this case to get, i.e. we
have

(467)

[f0, f0] = 0,
[f0, f1] = 0,
[f0, f2] + [f1, f1] = 0,
[f1, f2] + [f2, f1] + [f1, f1] = 0.

Using now (431), (466) and (467) we obtain

implying

which together with (470) and (471) yield

[f0, f3] = [

T0f0,

T0f3] = [f0, f3 + f2] ,

[f0, f2] = 0,

[f1, f1] = 0, [f1, f2] + [f2, f1] = 0.

Observe an important diﬀerence of the case a degenerate point compare with the
case of an inﬂection point. Namely, as it follows from (474) in the case of a degenerate
point of the rank 4 we have [f1, f1] = 0 where in the case of an inﬂection point according
to (458) [f1, f1]

= 0.

[f1, f3] = [

10. Perturbation theory for the matrix of reﬂection coeﬃcients.

In Section 6 we have introduce and studied the matrix ρ of reﬂection coeﬃcients and
its relation to the space ST (0; ω, kτ ). In this section we study the behavior of the
matrix ρ at frequencies ω close to the frequency of a degenerate point ω0, i.e. as
0. To do that we ﬁrst describe the space ST (0; ω, kτ ) by the formula
ν = ω
(227) where the vectors Φ1 and Φ2 depend on the frequency ν. As we know by now
that this dependence has the form (see (309) and the section on the perturbation
theory, and also (317))

vicinity of a degenerate point for all the three cases, namely, an inﬂection point,
n = 3, and degenerate points of the rank n = 4, 2.

The general framework determining the basic properties of the space

ST (0; ω)
has been considered in the subsections ”Basic properties of the space of relevant
eigenmodes” and ”Matrix of reﬂection coeﬃcients and the ﬂux quadratic form”.
At this point having investigated spectral properties of the transfer matrix
(ν),
ν = ω

theory of the transfer matrix a point of degeneracy”), we can provide more details
on the properties of
ST (0; ω) including the asymptotic behavior of the ﬂux and the
reﬂection coeﬃcients of the relevant eigenmodes for a semi-inﬁnite slab as ν

following formulas for the ﬂuxes

[e1 (ν) , e1 (ν)] = [e2 (ν) , e2 (ν)] = 0, [e3 (ν) , e3 (ν)] = [f3, f3] + O (ν)
[e0 (ν) , e1 (ν)] = [e0 (ν) , e2 (ν)] = [e0 (ν) , e3 (ν)] = 0,
[e3 (ν) , e0 (ν)] = [e3 (ν) , e1 (ν)] = [e3 (ν) , e2 (ν)] = 0.

The relation (508) clearly indicates that the reﬂection coeﬃcients r (α+; 0) are always
strictly lesser than 1 for all the relevant eigenmodes of the semi-inﬁnite periodic stack,
with only exception when EM ﬁeld value of the eigenmode on the surface of the slab is
f0. In other words, at an inﬂection point there always will be a positive fraction of the
incident energy transmitted through the inﬁnite slab. In fact, by a proper design of the
slab one can achieve almost 100% transmission of the incident energy. In contrast,
at any band edges the transmission is always exactly zero and the reﬂection is always
100%, as we will from the analysis in the following sections.

particular, the space

The relation (526) clearly indicates that the reﬂection coeﬃcient r (α+; 0) is always
exactly 1 for all the relevant eigenmodes of semi-inﬁnite periodic stack In other words,
at any degenerate point of the rank n = 4 100% of the incident energy is reﬂected and,
hence, no energy is transmitted. In contrast, at any inﬂection point a positive fraction
of the incident energy is always transmitted.

More elaborate analysis allows to get asymptotic expressions for the matrix of

So, unlike in situations for n = 3, 4 in the case n = 2 only the vector e0 (ν) belongs
ST (0; ω0 + ν), where another one, namely e1 (ν), does not belong to
to the space
ST (0; ω0 + ν) since it corresponds to an eigenmode propagating in the negative

if there can be any transmission of energy by a mode related to a regular band edge

In the case of

propagating in the positive direction with non-zero velocity. In this case the calculation
are similar to the case (542) with the only diﬀerence that we have to pick the single
eigenmode related to the band edge and ﬁnd the corresponding ﬂux and the reﬂection
coeﬃcient. For that mode the result is the same as in the case (542).

So, we assume now that the condition (542) is satisﬁed. Notice that under the

condition ((542) in view of (131) and (132) we have

[e0 (ν) , e2 (ν)] = 0, [e2 (ν) , e2 (ν)] = 0, ν

Then it follows from (541) that

ST (0; ω0) = Span

Notice the representation (544) for the space
yield

[f, f] = 0 for any f

e0 (0) , e2 (0)
}

.

ST (0; ω0) together with (538) and (543)
(545)
∈ ST (0; ω0) .

The relation (545) combined with (223) and (224) imply the following very important
property of the reﬂection coeﬃcient r (α+; 0) at the inﬂection point ω0, i.e. ν = 0,

The relation (526) clearly indicates that the reﬂection coeﬃcient r (α+; 0) is always
exactly 1 for all the relevant eigenmodes of semi-inﬁnite periodic stack related to the
band edge.

(cid:1)

More elaborate analysis allows to get asymptotic expressions for the matrix of
reﬂection coeﬃcients ρ, as determined by (232) and (496), and other related quantities

(547)

Notice the generically e0 (0) and e2 (0) are always linearly independent and, hence,

are linearly independent.

(548)

The relation (548) shows that the condition (492) is satisﬁed.

Now let ﬁnd the value Φ (α+; ν) of the eigenmode corresponding to the incident

The above formulas for the reﬂection coeﬃcient indicate clearly that at a band
edge the reﬂection coeﬃcient approaches 1 as one gets close to it. In contrast to it,
in a vicinity of an inﬂection point the reﬂection coeﬃcient becomes closer a lesser
than 1 number r0 and, it turns out, that it can be made arbitrarily small for properly
designed structures.

The table below shows the asymptotic behavior of the slow mode group velocity,
the saturation amplitude, and the semi-inﬁnite slab transmittance for the frequency
approaching the respective stationary point.

Particular constructions of the perturbation theory we discuss here follow to [42] and
[43]. Suppose that

To diagonalize T (ν) we use the approach outlined in [42] and used in [43]. Namely,
there exists the following representation for the diagonal form X of T (ν)

ζ = e−

S(ν)W eS(ν) = W0 + νζ1 + ν2ζ2 +

(575)

where matrices S1, S2, . . . do not depend on ν and X1, X2, . . . are diagonal. To ﬁnd
Sj and Xj we use the Hausdorf’s representation

X = e−

SW eS = W + [W, S] +

[[W, S] , S] +

, where

(576)

where the brackets denote the commutator of two matrices

Substituting (575) into (576) and equating the terms of like powers in ν, we obtain
the following expressions for the matrices Xj

X1 = [T0, S1] + T1, X2 = [T0, S2] + T2 + [T1, S1] +

[[T0, S1] , S1] , . . . .

To ﬁnd Xj we introduce for a matrix Y its representation as the sum of its diagonal
¯Y part and the remaining part ˚Y with zero diagonal elements (so called integrable
matrix [42])

Y = ¯Y + ˚Y , ¯Y = diag (Y ) , ˚Y = Y

diag (Y ) .

(578)

Then

X1 = [W0, S1] + ¯W1 + ˚W1,
(579)
and to get rid of the integrable part ˚W1 of W1 we take S1 to be the solution of the
equation

Solution to this equation is

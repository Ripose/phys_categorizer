A well known description of superradiance from pointlike collections of many atoms involves
the dissipative motion of a large spin. The pertinent “superradiance master equation” allows for a
formally exact solution which we subject to a semiclassical evaluation. The clue is a saddle-point
approximation for an inverse Laplace transform. All previous approximate treatments, disparate as
they may appear, are encompassed in our systematic formulation. A byproduct is a hitherto un-
known rigorous relation between coherences and probabilities. Our results allow for generalizations
to spin dynamics with chaos in the classical limit.

I. INTRODUCTION

Dissipative motion of large spins was ﬁrst seen in experiments on superradiance or superﬂuorescence (For extensive
reviews see Refs. [1,2]), after being proposed a lot earlier by Dicke [3]. The so called superradiance master equation
proposed in [4,5] has since become a standard tool for describing the collective dynamics of identical superradiating
atoms in the small-sample limit. Formally speaking, it provides a quantum treatment of a large spin with conserved
square, J2 = j(j + 1), with the quantum number j capable of taking on positive half integer or integer values up to
half the number of atoms N . The origin of such an angular momentum lies in the familiar formal equivalence of a
single two-level atom to a spin- 1
2 . In (semi)classical parlance, the spin in question is called the Bloch vector whose
z-component measures the energy stored in atomic excitation while the transverse components are related to the
dipole element responsible for the atomic transition. More or less everything worth knowing about the superradiance
master equation in relation to the numerous superﬂuorescence experiments has been worked out more than a decade
ago.

When we pick up the thread now our motivation is not to better explain anything previously observed, but rather
the expectation of new experiments involving dissipative motion of large spins constituted by many identical two-level
atoms, albeit motions that would have a chaotic classical limit and display quantum manifestations of chaos when
the spin quantum number j is of the order of several hundreds or thousands. When beginning to look into such
dynamics [6] we found, somewhat to our surprise, that previous treatments of the superradiance master equation were
so directly geared to the speciﬁcs of superradiant pulses as transient events that new questions do indeed require some
new theoretical work. In particular, the semiclassical limit of large j deserves systematic attention and turns out to
harbor one or the other surprise which we begin to uncover in the present paper.

The large-j limit can be approached through the rigorous solution of the master equation which was known from the
very beginning [4], and we shall actually follow that path here. Strangely enough, up to now that rigorous solution
has mostly been looked upon as a curiosity rather than a useful starting point of analytic work; even numerical
evaluations were disfavored against routines for solving coupled diﬀerential equations for density matrix elements in
some representation.

We propose to show that the large-j limit is very conveniently accessed by subjecting the rigorous Laplace trans-
formed density matrix to a saddle-point evaluation of the inverse Laplace transformation. More speciﬁcally, we carry
out this program in the eigenrepresentation of Jz and J2 for the density matrix
jm′
and the propagator
ρ(t)

. The saddle-point result turns out reliable provided that
relating that density matrix to its initial form
jm

h
not only j is large but also the diﬀerence between the initial and ﬁnal eigenvalues of Jz, i.e.
1. That
restriction unfortunately aﬀects the propagator at early times while most of the probability still resides in levels m
close to the initial m′. We therefore establish an independent early-time propagator, show its agreement with the
saddle-point version in a certain time span and ﬁnally combine the two to an explicit expression of uniform validity.
Our uniform propagator turns out to systematically encompass previous asymptotic results. Among these is,
trivially, the fully classical behavior arising in the limit j
as long as the initial state is not too close to the state
of full initial excitation m = j which in the classical limit is an inﬁnitly long-lived state of marginal equilibrium. The
classical behavior in question is that of an overdamped pendulum. The pertinent equation of motion for the so-called
Bloch angle θ (deﬁned through cos θ = limj→∞
dτ θ = sin θ;
the the well known solution is

Furthermore, we recover the random-jitter picture ﬁrst suggested in [7,8] and the ensuing distribution of delay times
as well as the scaling results for time dependent expectation values of products of the observables Jx, Jy, Jz obtained
by somewhat hit-and-run methods in [9,10].

An interesting byproduct of our investigation is an exact relation between diagonal and oﬀdiagonal elements of
the density matrix in the jm-basis, which to the best of our knowledge has previously gone unnoticed. One may
thus conﬁne all work towards solving the master equation to the probabilities
and eventually obtain the
coherences

through the relation in question.

II. MASTER EQUATION AND DISSIPATIVE PROPAGATOR

The two states of an atom resonantly coupled to a mode of the electromagnetic ﬁeld may be thought of as the
2 , and all observables of the eﬀective two-level atom can be represented as linear combinations of

states of a spin- 1

2

∝ −

unity and the three spin operators Jx, Jy, Jz. In particular, the energy may be associated with Jz and the other two
spin operators with the atomic dipole moment. If N such atoms, all identical, couple collectively to the electric ﬁeld
x is the sum of all single-atom contributions;
E one has an interaction Hamiltonian
similarly, one has a global atomic energy
z . The collective spin operators obey the familiar angular-
momentum commutation relations [Jx, Jy] = iJz etc. The Hilbert space for the N atoms is 2N dimensional but falls
into subspaces not connected by the collective observables Ji; each subspace has ﬁxed J2 = j(j + 1) with nonnegative
integer or half-integer j not exceeding N/2. The (2j + 1) states in the jth subspace are conveniently taken as the
j + 2, . . . , j. The highest energy may be associated with
eigenstates
of Jz with eigenvalues m =
2 consists of N + 1 states
m = j whereupon the ground state has m =
which are all totally symmetric in all atoms; that space may be singled out experimentally by preparing all atoms in
their lower state.

In the superradiance experiments of Ref. [11] a single mode of the electromagnetic ﬁeld within a resonator was cou-
pled to N two-level atoms such that the dynamics was that of the so-called Jaynes-Cummings model, with dissipation
included to account for ﬁeld losses from the resonator. In the limit of overdamped Rabi oscillations the ﬁeld mode
can be eliminated adiabatically. A master equation for the atomic density operator thus results [4,5] of which we shall
consider the low-temperature version, thus forbidding the atoms to pick up thermal photons from the environment,

III. SADDLE-POINT ASYMPTOTICS OF THE DISSIPATIVE PROPAGATOR

There have been a number of successful attempts to treat the large-j limit of the superradiance problem [4,9,10,7,8,1].
These were concerned with the solution of the master equation for certain particular cases or directly aimed at
speciﬁc average properties of the process. The purpose of the present paper is to establish uniform asymptotics of
the dissipative propagator without such restrictions. We use the exact solution of the master equation in the form of
the Laplace integral which was obtained long ago [4] but remained largely unexplored. Previously established results
for the propagator, the distribution of delay times, and time dependent expectation values follow from our uniform
asymptotic propagator.

Before embarking on our proposed asymptotic adventure it is convenient to adopt the parameter

j(j + 1)

as a measure of the “size” of the angular momentum; the semiclassical formulae to be established take a prettier form
if we use J rather than j.

A. Laplace representation of the exact propagator

Following [4] let us recall the Laplace integral representation of the propagator. Deﬁning the Laplace image as

the new unknowns ˜ρm(t) then turn out to evolve in time like probabilities, i.e. to obey (2.6) for k = 0.

The positive sign of the exponents in these relations between probabilities and coherences is not a misprint: the
coherence ρk
m = ρm+k,m−k does decay more slowly than the density ρm = ρm,m. Moreover, there is no conﬂict with
the nowadays popular phenomenon of accelerated decoherence [12,13,15]: Quantum dissipative processes do imply
much larger decay rates for coherences than for probabilities but only so with respect to certain states which are
distinguished by the process itself; for the dissipative process studied here such distinguished states are, for instance,
coherent angular-momentum states [14,10] but not the states

C. Saddle-point evaluation of the Laplace integral

The relation (3.6) between probabilities and coherences clearly allows us to conﬁne the remaining investigation to
the case k = 0, i.e. to the propagator of the densities. Our goal is to do the integral in the exact formula (3.5) in the
limit of large J. To begin with, let us rewrite that formula for k = 0 as

with the exponent

Suppose now that n
m its value
is generally also large, which fact suggests a saddle-point approximation. The stationary points of the exponent are
given by the solutions for v of

1. Then since the number of terms in the sum Z is proportional to n

All roots of this saddle-point equation are real as is immediately seen by putting v = x + iy and separating the
imaginary part. We further note that to the right of the largest pole vmax = max
of the integrand in (3.5)
the sum in (3.10) decreases monotonically from +
to 0 as v grows from vmax to inﬁnity. Therefore we have one
and only one root v0 in that domain. Its position depends on the time τ : When τ goes to zero v0 tends to inﬁnity;
conversely, for τ

the saddle point v0 approaches the pole at vmax.

m≤l≤n {−

The second derivative with respect to v of the exponent,

is positive for real v which means that the direction of steepest descent from the saddle is parallel to the imaginary
axis. The saddle-point approximation for the integral (3.8) thus gives

Unlike the saddle-point approximation, the foregoing expression is fully explicit. We shall keep referring to it as the
small-time approximant although the underlying small parameter is the combination (4.2) of both τ and the quantum

The two approximations under discussion can be merged into a single one which generally behaves like the saddle-

to divide the saddle-point result (3.12) by the ratio of the factorial (n

large that ratio is unity but otherwise the correction replaces the saddle-point version with the small-time propagator

It is valid in a wide range of quantum numbers and propagation times and thus merits the name uniformly asymptotic
propagator. The error is of order 1/J 2 except for the not very interesting late times when the bulk of the probability
has settled in the lowest level; that latter restriction for τ arises due to the close encounter of saddle and pole mentioned
in Sect. IIIC.

We have checked that (4.6) provides an eﬃcient tool to numerically calculate the dissipative propagator; if j is large
its accuracy becomes comparable or even superior to that of the numerical integration of the master equation. The
only inconvenience is the necessity to determine the saddle-point parameter a = a(µ, ν, τ ) by solving (3.16) which
generally has to be done numerically.

V. SPECIAL CASES

We proceed to considering situations in which the uniform approximation simpliﬁes. The strategy invariably is
to approximate factorials of large numbers `a la Stirling. Some cases even allow for an analytical solution for the
saddle-point parameter a whereupon fully explicit formulas for the propagator arise. Some well-known results of
superradiance theory are thus recovered and revealed as special cases of the uniform approximation.

A. Semiclassical approximation

The uniformly asymptotic propagator (4.6) depends on the quantum numbers m, n, j in two ways. First there is
the factorial dependence which reﬂects the discrete character of the representation. Second, there is the dependence
on the arguments µ, ν which can be regarded as the classical counterparts of m, n scaled with respect to the total

Suppose we are not interested in eﬀects tied up with the discreteness of quantum levels and want to obtain a smooth

function of the macroscopic coordinates µ, ν only. This is easily achieved by replacing the factorials (n

We here speak of the semiclassical approximation because of the implied assumption that all the quantum numbers
and their relevant combinations are large. As a function of µ at ﬁxed ν and τ the semiclassical propagator displays a

Written in terms of the polar angle of the Bloch vector cos Θ = µ, cos Θ0 = ν the last equation becomes the solution
of the equation of motion of the overdamped pendulum (1.1) mentioned in the Introduction. Indeed, the classical
picture of the atomic dynamics in superradiance is that of the Bloch vector creeping from whatever initial orientation
θ0 towards the equilibrium θ = π like an overdamped pendulum with the azimutal angle φ = arctan(Jx/Jy) ﬁxed.
None too surprisingly, the maximum of the distribution Dmn with respect to m occurs at the point m = m(n, τ )
predicted by the classical motion of the Bloch vector.

As it stands in (5.1) the semiclassical propagator correctly describes a broadening of the initially sharp distribution
√J. For many applications that width is negligible such that we may

Dmn(τ = 0) = δmn to one with a width
replace the propagator by

B. Early stage of superradiant decay of highest-energy initial states

We now take up the previously best studied aspect of superradiance, the decay of the most highly excited atomic
initial states, j
j. We begin by studying the early stage, i.e. small τ , while the bulk of the probability still
resides with highly excited states. This means that only those propagator elements are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from
zero for which the ﬁnal quantum number m is also close to j, or j

C. Bright stage of superradiant decay of highly excited initial states

Suppose now that the initial level is close to but the ﬁnal quantum number m far away from j such that j

m
is of the order of j. For simplicity we shall also assume that m is not close to
j. In classical terms, we take the
Bloch vector as initially pointing almost to the north pole, but we wait long enough for it to develop a substantial
component transverse to the polar orientation, i.e. a strong dipole moment; by excluding the late stages of near
south polar orientation we conﬁne ourselves to the phase of brightest radiation which actually gave rise to the term
“super”radiance.

Under the limitations on m, n just speciﬁed the saddle-point equation (3.16) can still be solved analytically. The
important fact is that the function a takes on values close to unity. More accurately, it can be shown that the diﬀerence

Contact with several previous treatments of superradiance is made by considering the bright-stage propagator (5.16)
for high initial excitation as a function D(µ, τ ; n) of the ﬁnal coordinate µ and the time τ and verifying it to obey the
ﬁrst-order partial diﬀerential equation

Obviously, that dynamics is devoid of quantum eﬀects: The propagator D drifts along the characteristics of 5.17, i.e.

where ν(µ, τ ) is the time reversed classical trajectory obtained by solving (5.4) for ν. All quantum eﬀects inherent in

We should emphasize that this eﬀective initial distribution does not coincide with the true sharp initial form of
the propagator, simply because our asymptotic propagator (5.16) is not valid at small times. The essence of the
earlier theories of Refs. [7–9] is thus recovered: Each run of a superradiant decay of a highly excited atomic initial
state produces a macroscopic, i.e. classical radiation pulse originating from eﬀectively random initial data, the latter
reﬂecting quantum ﬂuctuations.

VI. PASSAGE TIME DISTRIBUTION

In the classical picture of superradiance the Bloch vector starts its downward motion from a certain initial angle
Θ0 and crosses the latitude Θ at a strictly deﬁnite time τclass(µ, ν) with ν = cos Θ0, µ = cos Θ. In other words, the
classical probability density of the times of crossing a given coordinate µ on the way from the initial point ν is given
τclass(µ, ν)) = δ(τ ′); the quantum time shift τ ′ deﬁned in (5.11) is strictly zero in the
by the delta function δ(τ
classical limit.

−

Let us now introduce the quantum mechanical generalization of the classically sharp passage time distribution.
According to the master equation (2.6) for the densities, the change of the probability for the system to be in level m
gmρm) dτ . The quantity gmρm(τ )dτ is obviously the probability for
during the time interval dτ equals (gm+1ρm+1 −
1 during the time interval [τ, τ + dτ ] and
the atoms to go down from level m to level m
−
Pm(τ ) = gmρm(τ )

(6.1)

is the corresponding probability density for the time of passage through level m. In particular, by stipulating the
atoms to have started from the pure state
with n > m, we specify the passage time distribution as proportional
to the propagator,

jn
|

i

(6.2)
By simply integrating ˙Dmn(τ ) as given by the master equation (2.6) one easily shows that our passage time distribution
is properly normalized to unity,

Pm(τ ; n) = gmDmn(τ ).

∞

0
Z

Pm(τ ; n)dτ = 1.

Our uniform approximation for the propagator allows to easily and accurately calculate the passage time distri-
bution.
In particular, if the initial state is not close to the north pole, the function Pm(τ ; n) is just a somewhat
widened variant of the classical delta distribution, with a width inversely proportional to the square root of the
second derivative JΦµµ at the maximum of the exponent in the semiclassical approximation (5.1).

However, for the more interesting initial states of highest excitation, the passage time distribution has little in

The absence of any explicit dependence on m and j means that the time distributions of probability calculated

When l becomes large compared with unity the distribution (6.4) becomes sharply peaked around the point τ ′ = 0

VII. APPENDIX: UNIFORM AND SEMICLASSICAL APPROXIMATIONS FOR THE PROPAGATOR
OF COHERENCES

The uniform approximation for the dissipative propagator of the non-diagonal elements (k

= 0) is obtained via
the exact relation (3.6).
In the semiclassical approximation Stirling’s formula is also applied in order to replace
Qm±k, Qn±k by smooth functions of macroscopic arguments. We ﬁrst note the uniform approximation for the prop-
agator of coherences

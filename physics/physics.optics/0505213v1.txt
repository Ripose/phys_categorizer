We show the standard two-level continuous-time model of loss-modulated CO2 lasers to display
the same regular network of self-similar stability islands known so far to be typically present only
in discrete-time models based on mappings. For class B laser models our results suggest that, more
than just convenient surrogates, discrete mappings in fact could be isomorphic to continuous ﬂows.

Lasers with modulated parameters are arguably among
the simplest and most accessible laser systems of inter-
est for applications in science and engineering and for
theoretical investigations. The intrinsic interest in prac-
tical applications and in the nonlinear dynamics of mod-
ulated lasers has spurred a wide range of studies after the
remarkably inﬂuential work of Arecchi et al. [1] report-
ing the ﬁrst measurement of subharmonic bifurcations,
multistability, and chaotic behavior in a Q-switched CO2
laser. Since then, CO2 lasers have been fruitfully ex-
ploited in many situations. Recent applications include
studies of stochastic bifurcations in modulated CO2 laser
[2], multistability induced by periodic modulations [3].
Rich nonlinear response of CO2 lasers with current mod-
ulation and cavity detuning [4], and self-focusing eﬀects
in nematic liquid crystals [5].

In the last 20 years the CO2 laser was extensively
studied theoretically, numerically and experimentally
[6, 7, 8, 9], but focusing mainly on the characterization of
dynamical behaviors in phase-space for speciﬁc parame-
ters. While a detailed description of phase-space dynam-
ics is already available in the literature [6, 10, 11, 12],
no equivalent description exists for the parameter space,
except for works by Goswami [13] who investigated ana-
lytically the ﬁrst few period-doubling bifurcations for the
Toda model of the CO2 laser [14].

The present Letter reports an investigation of the pa-
rameter space of a paradigmatic model of class B lasers,
the CO2 laser. More speciﬁcally, we study a popular
two-level model of a CO2 laser with modulated losses,
focusing on the global stability of the laser with respect
to the modulation, not the intensity. The remarkable
discovery reported here is that stability islands of the
continuous-time laser model emerge organized in a very
regular network of self-similar structures called shrimps
[15], illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, and previously known
to exist only in the parameter space of discrete-time dy-
namical systems [15, 16, 17, 18]. Thus far, all attempts to
uncover shrimps in ﬂows, i.e. in continuous-time dynam-
ical systems modeled with sets of diﬀerential equations,
have failed to produce them [19].

The single-mode dynamics of the loss-modulated CO2
laser involves two coupled degrees of freedom and a time-

dependent parameter which we write, as usual [3, 6, 8],

du

=

(z − k)u,

τ

= (z0 − z)γ − uz.

(1a)

(1b)

Here, u is proportional to the radiation density, z and
z0 are the gain and unsaturated gain in the medium, re-
spectively, τ denotes the transit time of the light in the
laser cavity, γ is the gain decay rate, and k ≡ k(t) rep-
resents the total cavity losses. The losses are modulated
periodically as follows,

k(t) = k0(1 + a cos 2πf t),

(2)

where k0 is the constant part of the losses and a and
f , the amplitude and frequency of the modulation, are
the main bifurcation parameters. The remaining param-
eters are ﬁxed at τ = 3.5 × 10−9 s, γ = 1.978 × 105
s−1, z0 = 0.175 and k0 = 0.1731. These are realistic val-
ues, used in recent theoretical and experimental investi-
gations [3].
Integrations were done using the standard
fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme with ﬁxed time-step,
equal to h = 4 × 10−8. Phase diagrams in a × f space are
obtained by computing Lyapunov exponents for a mesh
of 600 × 600 equally spaced parameters. Starting from
an arbitrary initial condition, we “followed the attractor”
that is, after increasing parameters we initiated iterations
using the last obtained values as the new initial condi-
tions. The largest exponents were codiﬁed into a bitmap
with a continuous color scale ranging from the maximum
positive (green) to maximum negative (blue) exponents.
Zero exponents were codiﬁed in black. One of the expo-
nents is always zero since it is simply related to the time
evolution. Three illustrative bitmaps for the laser model
are shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1a displays a global view of the parameter space.
The most prominent features, the broad curved struc-
tures in Fig. 1a, show that the parameter space of the
laser model above, Eqs. (1a-b), agrees qualitatively quite
well with the description of Goswami [13] for the Toda
model of the CO2 laser. For the parameters chosen, the

relaxation frequency of our laser model is 50 kHz. From
Fig. 1a it is possible to see that there is a minimum ampli-
tude threshold a beyond which subharmonic bifurcations
start to occur, corresponding to about 100 kHz, the har-
monic of the relaxation frequency. In addition, for certain
parameter values new stability domains are created by
saddle-node bifurcations, each of them undergoing then
its own cascade of period doublings. So, in certain pa-
rameter ranges more than one stable mode coexist, giv-
ing rise to generalized multistability. This feature may
be recognized in Fig. 1 from the apparent sudden discon-
tinuities in the coloring, due only to the impossibility of
plotting two distinct colors in the same place.

The most interesting feature in Fig. 1a is the remark-
ably regular structuring which appears in the region con-
taining the box, shown magniﬁed in Fig. 1b. This ﬁg-
ure shows that embedded in the wide domain of parame-

ters leading to chaotic laser oscillations there is a regular
structuring of self-similar parameter windows, shrimps,
containing cascades of stable periodic oscillations, the
main period of a few of the larger shrimps indicated by
the number near to them. The period-11 shrimp seen
in Fig. 1b is shown magniﬁed in Fig. 1c. Starting from
the main period-11 body, it displays two distinct dou-
bling cascades as well as an inﬁnite number of addi-
tional period-doubling cascades, as thoroughly described
for discrete-time systems in Refs. [15, 16].

The computation of bitmaps for the laser model is very
computer demanding. To alleviate this problem and to
manifest the isomorphism between ﬂows and maps, we
display the generic ﬁne and hyperﬁne structure of stabil-
ity islands typically present in multidimensional systems
using the two-parameter H´enon map as a paradigm:

xt+1 = a − x2

t + b yt,

yt+1 = xt.

FIG. 4: Time evolution of the laser intensity u(t) for the large
period-8 structure in Fig. 1b, plotted in (a) logarithmic scale,
(b) linear scale. Here T = 1/(89.8 kHz) is the period of the
modulation.

The nonlinearity parameter a (forcing) represents the bi-
furcation or control parameter. The damping parameter
b varies between −1 ≤ b ≤ 1, with b = 1 representing the
conservative limit and b = 0 the limit of strong damping.
While for b = 0 there exists just a single chaotic attrac-
tor over a wide range of the parameter a, several periodic
and chaotic attractors coexist when b 6= 0.

FIG. 5: Predicted signal intensity for the six period-16 sta-
bility islands labeled A, B, . . . F, in Fig. 1b. Signals (a) and
(b), at points A and B, are period-8 doublings. All other sig-
nals are from islands which begin with period-16. Note that
 
signals look very similar, despite the fact that they originate
from very distinct regions of the parameter space. Parameters
(a, f ) are: (a) A = (0.06902, 87.43), (b) B = (0.07138, 90.47),
(c) C = (0.063715, 92.15), (d) D = (0.062255, 75.735), (e)
E = (0.0749617, 67.3281), (f) F = (0.073666, 83.359). Note
that T ≡ 1/f is slightly diﬀerent for each signal.

Since all these attractors evolve in the same generic
manner, we consider here the strongly dissipative limit,
focusing on slightly negative values of b. In this domain,
Pando et al. [20] found that a much more sophisticated
four-level model of the CO2 laser with modulated losses
behaves qualitatively similar to the H´enon map. The
CO2 laser dynamics, as of any class B laser, is charac-
terized by a time-delay between the intensity and the
population inversion, a fact that nicely matches the de-
layed character of the H´enon map when written as a one-
dimensional recurrence relation.

Figure 2 shows how regularly shrimps organize them-
selves along very speciﬁc directions in parameter space.
The ordering along the main diagonal of Fig. 2a is the
same found for the laser, in Fig. 1a, along the direction
containing the encircled periods. Analogously, the sec-
ondary diagonal in Fig. 2a displays the same ordering
that the parabolic arc in the middle of Fig. 1c.

The laser-H´enon agreement in parameter space perme-

4

ates also to the phase space as corroborated by Fig. 3,
comparing return maps for the laser (on the left column)
with those for the H´enon map (right column). The laser
return maps were constructed using the sequence uℓ(t),
ℓ = 1, 2, 3, . . . of relative maxima of u(t). As it is easy to
see, both sets of return maps agree remarkably well [21].
How easy is to detect experimentally the regular struc-
turing reported here? Figure 4 illustrates a represen-
tative laser signal in two scales. Although waveforms
and underlying periodicities are easy to recognize in log-
arithmic scale, their experimental detection may become
strenuous, particularly as the period increases. For in-
stance, contemplating the six period-16 stability islands
in Fig. 1b, two of them arising from period-8 via saddle-
node bifurcations, one may ask what sort of diﬀerences
should be expected in their measurement. The answer
is depicted in Fig. 5. In a real experimental setup, the
diﬃculties to surmount are mainly to access narrow high-
period windows, and to have a wide enough detection
range. Modulated losses are usually obtained with an
intracavity polarizer and an electro-optical modulator.
Recent progress in low-voltage electro-optical modulators
have considerably improved their performances [22]. To
detect large and small peaks simultaneously one can use
a logarithmic preampliﬁer [23]. Thus, detection and dis-
crimination of the laser signals in Fig. 5 is experimentally
feasible with existing technology.

To uncover isomorphisms between continuous-time
(ﬂows) and discrete-time (maps) in dynamical systems is
an important event from a physical and dynamical point
of view and immediately raises interesting questions. For
instance, is an isomorphism to be expected also for more
reﬁned laser models such that, e.g., of Cioﬁni et al. [24],
involving two rate-equations derived for a single-mode
CO2 laser using center manifold theory for a four-levels
model [25]? Their model is interesting because, as they
say, it agrees well with experiments. Do networks of
shrimps exist for the laser model proposed very recently
by Meucci et al. [26]. Do they exist for other laser models
too? Is it possible to ﬁnd them in the parameter space
of the laser parameters, not modulation? In autonomous
systems? Which laser system presents more restricted
amplitude variations, making life easier for experimental-
ists? What sort of mechanism generates shrimps in diﬀer-
ential equations? How are basins of attraction entangled
in multistable domains where self-similar structures are
abundant [27]? We will report on this elsewhere.

We present a solution to the problem of reﬂection/refraction of a polarized Gaussian beam on the
interface between two transparent media. The transverse shifts of the beams’ centers of gravity are
calculated. They always satisfy the total angular momentum conservation law for beams, however,
in general, do not satisfy the conservation laws for individual photons in consequence of the lack
of the “which path” information in a two-channel wave scattering. The ﬁeld structure for the
reﬂected/refracted beam is analyzed.
In the scattering of a linearly-polarized beam, photons of
opposite helicities are accumulated at the opposite edges of the beam: this is the spin Hall eﬀect
for photons, which can be registered in the cross-polarized component of the scattered beam.

INTRODUCTION. Reﬂection/refraction of plane
electromagnetic waves at the interface between two ho-
mogeneous transparent media is described by the Snell
law and the Fresnel formulas [1]. However, in the case
of the localized wave packets (or beams) the Snell law
as well as the Fresnel formulas (as shown below) give
no exact description of their refraction and reﬂection.
First, the reﬂected packet undergoes a short longitudinal
shift in the reﬂection plane: this is the Goos–H¨anshen
eﬀect [2], which is not a subject of this work. Besides, a
circularly- (or elliptically-) polarized incident packet ex-
periences a transverse shift (TS) and leaves the plane of
incidence when refracting or reﬂecting. This eﬀect was
originally predicted by Fedorov [3] and since that time
has been discussed in a number of papers, both theoret-
ical [4, 5, 6, 7] and experimental [8, 9, 10].

TS plays a fundamental role in electrodynamics: this
phenomenon is responsible for the conservation of the
total angular momentum (TAM) of an electromagnetic
beam, including the intrinsic (spin) part [5, 7]. For a
smoothly inhomogeneous medium this eﬀect represents
the optical Magnus eﬀect [6, 9, 11] or the recently dis-
covered topological spin transport (spin Hall eﬀect) of
photons [7, 12]. However, in spite of a long period of
research, up until now the ultimate answer as to the
magnitude of TS, along with the correct wording of the
TAM conservation law for an electromagnetic beam, is
not found: almost all papers [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] result in dif-
ferent answers.

In this Letter we propose an exact solution to the
problem of reﬂection/refraction of an arbitrary polarized
Gaussian electromagnetic beam. This enables us to eval-
uate TSs of the centers of gravity of the scattered beams,
to determine the TAM conservation law that governs the
process, and to analyze the ﬁeld structure in the beams,
which reveals the spin Hall eﬀect for photons.

1) is the
Pauli matrix. TAM is related to the TAM density as
J = N j, where N = W/ω is the number of photons in
the packet, W is the total ﬁeld energy of the beam, and ω
stands for the frequency (we consider a monochromatic
packet). When a wave packet is scattered on the inter-
face z = 0 between two homogeneous media, the normal
to the surface component of TAM is conserved owing to
the axial symmetry of the problem: J (i)
z + J (t)
z .
From here on, the superscripts (i), (r), and (t) cor-
respond to the incident, reﬂected, and refracted wave
packets, respectively. The energy conservation law re-
sults in the conservation of the total number of pho-
tons: N (i) = N (r) + N (t). Taking into account that

and that the volume of the packet varies as V

index, while ϑ is the angle between k and z-axis), the

For the sake of simplicity we assume that the beam (3)
is conﬁned in y only, which enables us to consider only
TS along this coordinate and not the Goos–H¨anshen ef-
fect. The deviation from the center, y
= 0, results in a
small longitudinal (in the eZ -direction) ﬁeld component
proportional to y. Owing to this component, ﬁeld (3) sat-
isﬁes the Maxwell equations for a homogeneous medium:
divE = 0, i.e. E is orthogonal to the local wave vec-
tor kloc.
It is the longitudinal ﬁeld component that is
responsible for TS of the beam center in the process of
beam reﬂection and refraction. The representation of the
Gaussian polarized beam in the form of (3) holds good
for suﬃciently large distances y until the wavelength is
small compared to the characteristic beam width and the
radius of curvature of its phase front:

tained from Eq. (3) supplemented by standard boundary
conditions [1]. As a result of cumbersome but direct cal-

can be written in a uniﬁed form:

packets since one equation contains two unknown terms.
Another approach has been suggested in [7], where the
authors consider the wave packet scattering as a set of in-
dividual reﬂection/refraction events of isolated photons.
In this case each photon ﬁnds itself either in the medium
1 (is reﬂected) or in the medium 2 (is refracted); hence
two TAM conservation laws take place for one photon:

Eqs.(2) determined TSs of the wave packets in [7]; numer-

in the geometrical op-
tics approximation [6, 7, 11, 12]. This clariﬁes the fact
that jz is an exact integral of motion for the modiﬁed
equations of geometrical optics in an axially symmetrical
medium [7]. Below is shown that Eqs. (2) are consistent
with Eq. (1) for a circularly polarized initial beam. How-
ever, this is not true in the general case of an elliptically
polarized beam. We will demonstrate that the scatter-
ing of the Gaussian electromagnetic beam in all cases
satisﬁes Eq. (1) and not Eqs. (2). The fallacy of the
Eqs. (2) stems apparently from the quantum-mechanical
approach [7], which is based on the events for individ-
ual photons. The point is that classical electrodynamics
describes a multiphoton interference pattern. By invok-
ing the conservation laws (2) we invoke thereby a “which
path” information, which destroys, as is well known from
quantum mechanics, the interference pattern in the mul-
tiphoton scattering [13]. Thus Eqs. (2) are suitable for
describing the scattering process of individual photons;

Indeed, the elliptical polarizations of opposite signs
arise at the opposite edges of the beam. (As a conse-
quence, the beam as a whole is depolarized, i.e. in con-
trast to the Fresnel formulas for plane waves, the polar-
ization state of the linearly polarized beam changes after
reﬂection/refraction and becomes mixed.) In the approx-
imation considered, the degree of the circular polarization
is proportional to y, i.e.
it grows linearly with the dis-
tance from the beam center. The initiation of elliptical
polarizations at the ends of a linearly polarized beam is
a manifestation of the spin Hall eﬀect for photons: the
photons of opposite helicities accumulate at the opposite
ends of the beam just as in the recently discovered spin
Hall eﬀect for carriers in semiconductors [16, 17]. It is
interesting that this eﬀect for photons was predicted as
early as 1965 in the paper of Costa de Beauregard [4].

the splitting of a linearly polarized beam can be ob-
served experimentally by measuring the cross-polarized
ﬁeld component of the reﬂected/refracted beam (i.e. Ea

do not satisfy the conservation laws for individual pho-
tons because of the fundamentally two-channel character
of the process and the lack of “which path” information
in classical electrodynamics. The ﬁeld structure for the
reﬂected/refracted beam has been analyzed. Initially lin-
early polarized beam splits into two circularly polarized
beams shifted in opposite directions. This causes the rise
of elliptical polarizations of opposite signs at the beam
edges, i.e. the spin Hall eﬀect for photons. The eﬀect
can be detected by measuring the split cross-component
of the scattered beam’s ﬁeld.

the relative cross-component intensity for m = 0 (Fig.

optical polarizers and laser beams, one can look forward
to detect the cross-component like that in Fig. 2 and,
hence, to register the spin Hall eﬀect of photons.

CONCLUSION. We have solved the problem of re-
ﬂection/refraction of an electromagnetic polarized Gaus-
sian beam at the interface between two homogeneous
media. The transverse shifts of the centers of gravity
for the reﬂected and refracted beams have been calcu-
lated. In all cases they satisfy the total angular momen-
tum conservation law for beams, but in the generic case

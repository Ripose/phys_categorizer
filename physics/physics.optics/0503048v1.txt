High order stimulated Brillouin scattering in single-mode ﬁbers with strong feedback

Department of Electrical Engineering Technion—Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000, Israel∗

We present an experimental and theoretical study of cascaded high order Stimulated Brillouin
Scatterings (SBS) in single mode ﬁbers.
It is shown that because of the back-scattering nature
of the process, feedback in the input port is needed for obtaining a signiﬁcant cascaded eﬀect in
nonresonant systems. We also discuss similarities to nonlinear photorefractive processes.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) has a long re-
search history as a basic phenomenon and as a tool in
many contexts and materials. We mention here two im-
portant connections to SBS that were intensively studied
in the last three decades. The ﬁrst one is the link to
phase conjugation [1]. It was found that the reﬂection of
focused light beams in various media gave in some cases a
phase conjugate replica of the input beam. This method
gave maybe the ﬁrst demonstration of phase conjugation,
and later generated many activities. Another wave of re-
search was related to SBS in ﬁbers [2], ﬁrst in multi-mode
ﬁbers, and then more intensively to single mode ﬁbers.
Here the conventional meaning of phase conjugation in
the spatial or pictorial aspect is meaningless, especially
when we consider single mode ﬁbers. Nevertheless, the
nonlinear coupling eﬃciency becomes very high even for
low light powers at the mW regime, due to the light con-
ﬁnement along large distances in the ﬁber, compared to
limited focused lengths that can be obtained in free space
propagation. Therefore, SBS became a crucial factor that
has to be considered in ﬁber-optic communications. It is
usually an eﬀect that must be eliminated to allow the
light propagation without losing a big fraction of it to
reﬂections. It is similar to another eﬀect that was used
for phase conjugation, the stimulated Raman scattering
(SRS). In the SRS case however, there were found impor-
tant uses in ﬁber-optic communications. The main one
is the use as broadband ampliﬁers, especially at the im-
portant 1.5µm wavelength regime. A diﬀerence between
SRS and SBS is the magnitude of the frequency shift of
the reﬂected light (Stokes wave) compared to the input,
originating from the vibration frequency of the relevant
medium entity involved in the nonlinear process. This
frequency shift is in ﬁbers on the order of 10GHz for
SBS and 13T Hz in ﬁbers for SRS at the 1.5µm wave-
length regime.

In this paper we focus our attention on a cascaded SBS
process in single-mode ﬁbers. Therefore the present work
doesn’t oﬀer any direct use for phase conjugation. Nev-
ertheless, it can be meaningful for other SBS schemes, in
free space and multi-mode ﬁbers, where ”spatial” phase
conjugation is applicable. Additionally, one might ﬁnd

possible applications by using the self frequency shifts
that are in the order of future dense WDM (wavelenght
division multiplexing) technologies, believed to be heav-
ily used in future ﬁber-optic communications.

For this paper, presented in the context of works on dy-
namic holography and photorefractive optics, it is worth-
while to mention some similarities between SBS, SRS and
photorefractive four-wave mixing. Pioneering work was
done at the early stages when photorefractive materials
have been started to be a part of the ﬁeld of nonlinear-
optics, and was used for wave mixing, phase conjugation
and oscillators, at a few places around the world: in Kiev
[3] (by Kukhtarev, Markov, Odulov, Soskin, and Vinet-
skii), at Thomson CSF [4] (by Huignard, Spitz, Aubourg,
and Herriau, at the University of Southern California [5]
(by Feinberg and Hellwarth), and at Caltech [6, 7] (by
Cronin-Golomb, Fischer, White and Yariv. Later, a huge
stream of research was done around the world in many
aspects of photorefractivity. We mention a few works on
photorefractive wave-mixing, done in our group at Tech-
nion [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] (by Fischer, Sternklar,
Weiss and Segev), that can be associated to the present
work on SBS. The ﬁrst link is to a class of self oscilla-
tion processes in photorefractive media [5, 7, 8]. Like in
SBS, passive or self-pumped phase conjugate mirrors can
be obtained. Here four-wave mixing [9, 10] gives sponta-
neous phase conjugate reﬂection via pump beams which
are self generated and can be regarded as the ”internal”
crystal ”waves” (albeit light waves), like the self gener-
ated ”sound waves” in the SBS case [1]. The phase con-
jugation property can be also explained by similar argu-
ments, that among all possible scattering, the phase con-
jugate pattern which is an oppositely propagating replica
of the input light wave (and therefore coincide in space),
experiences the highest gain, and thus wins out and pre-
vails over all other scatterings [1, 11, 12]. Another sim-
ilarity is the self frequency shift of the reﬂection with
respect to the input light beam [13, 14, 15]. In the pho-
torefractive case, the shift is typically in the 1 − 10−3Hz
region, depending on the photorefractive buildup time
constant, which is much slower that the relevant nonlin-
ear eﬀect in the SBS and SRS cases. Additionally, for
photorefractive wave mixing one can also think of cas-
caded self reﬂections in an open or closed cavity. Speciﬁc
examples can be two-beam coupling, via reﬂection grat-
ings where the beams are almost counter-propagating, or
resonators that give high order oscillations.

It is also worthwhile to mention connections of ﬁbers

to phase conjugation.
In fact, one of the ﬁrst sugges-
tions for methods of phase conjugation and its uses dealt
with the restoration of images transmitted through multi-
mode ﬁbers [16]. It was proposed there to use nonlinear
three-wave mixing to phase conjugate the distorted image
transmitted through a ﬁber, and retransmit it through an
identical ﬁber section, such that the second propagation
exactly cancels the phase distortion of the ﬁrst section.
The idea was later demonstrated [17] in a single section
ﬁber with a round-trip propagation in the same ﬁber,
because of the diﬃculty to get two identical multi mode
ﬁbers. Another idea in the early stages of research that
gained a lot of recent attention in the ﬁber-optic commu-
nication community was to compensate for dispersion in
single mode ﬁbers by using the phase conjugation prop-
erty of ﬂipping the spectral band of a time dependent
signal [18]. Again a two section scheme with phase con-
jugation between them, can provide a perfect compensa-
tion.

SBS in ﬁbers has been studied intensively throughout
the years.
Input light at power levels on the order of
10 mW is strongly backscattered, producing a frequency
down shifted Stokes wave, due to nonlinear interaction
of light and sound waves. The associated threshold de-
pends on the light losses. The simplest conﬁguration for
studying SBS in optical ﬁbers is just a long enough opti-
cal ﬁber, typically of a few km, with a good termination
at its far end, to avoid feedback. Much work has been
done analyzing this system, the SBS threshold [22] and
the reﬂection strength, which is the ratio between the ﬁ-
nal power of the Stokes wave and the initial power of the
pump.

When feedback is added to the ﬁber from the far end
termination, or from other reﬂectors or simply by forming
a ring cavity, the SBS threshold can be lowered signiﬁ-
cantly and can even result in oscillation and a Brillouin
laser.

In a ﬁber with no feedback, SBS is well described by
the common ”three wave model”: the pump wave, the
Stokes wave and the mediating sound wave. Second or-
der SBS [19], which is the generation of yet another, sec-
ondary Stokes wave, by SBS from the ﬁrst SBS wave,
is known but considered to be weak for systems without
gain, and is usually neglected for such systems. However,
for systems with strong feedback, higher SBS orders can
be signiﬁcant, and taking them into account is crucial for
understanding the physics of such systems.

In this work we investigate a system with strong feed-
back, where several orders, a cascade of SBS, are gener-
ated, in a non-resonant system (open cavity, with only
one side feedback ). We realize that it is necessary to
put the feedback at the input port of the ﬁber to allow
the each SBS backscattering order to generate its own
SBS in an optimized intensity proﬁle along the ﬁber in-
teraction path. We compare the experimental results to
theoretical analysis, and trace clearly the vast eﬀects of
second and third order SBS. We ﬁnd good agreement be-
tween the experimental data and the multiple-order SBS

theory.

II. SBS WITHOUT FEEDBACK

In the simple Brillouin scattering scheme in long ﬁbers
most of the energy of the input laser can be transferred
to the Stokes wave. Therefore one would expect that the
Stokes wave would pass its energy to a counter propa-
gating Stokes wave moving again in the direction of the
input laser beam, and with a frequency of ω0 − 2Ω. Then
one can ask if and what order can be reached in such a
chain of cascaded SBS system? (the n-th order having
an additional frequency shift, such that ω0 − nΩ.) We
will mathematically solve the coupled wave equations for
these three waves and then show experimentally that for
a regular system, even the generation of the second or-
der (third wave) SBS is negligible. Later we show that a
chain process that builds many strong high order SBS is
possible by adding feedback via a simple reﬂector at the
input port.

The common three-wave SBS model (one acoustic and
two light waves) in steady state, is described by two cou-
pled diﬀerential equations, for the intensities of the pump
and the Stokes wave [25]:

= −gI1I2

dI1
dz

dI2
dz

= −gI1I2,

(1)

where I1 and I2 are the intensities of the incident and the
Stokes waves respectively. g is the Brillouin gain param-
eter, that depends on the ﬁber. These equations neglect
losses in the ﬁbers and can be integrated analytically (as
well as the ones with nonzero losses [30]) to yield the
following intensity proﬁles:

I2(z) =

I2(0)(I1(0) − I2(0))
I1(0)egz(I1(0)−I2(0)) − I2(0)
I1(z) = I1(0) − I2(0) + I2(z)

(2)

We choose our origin z = 0 at the pump input port of
the ﬁber. Then I1(0) is the intensity of the incident wave,
and I2(0) is the output intensity of the Stokes wave.

It is seen that if I2(L), the intensity of the Stokes wave
at the far side of the ﬁber, is zero, then I2(z) ≡ 0, which
means that there is no Stokes wave at all. This reﬂects
the fact that the Stokes wave must start from a seed,
whose source is noise in the system. According to several
approaches [20, 21], it is important to think of the noise
as distributed all over the ﬁber. We shall follow here the
simple case of a noise seed at the far side of the ﬁber, on
the order of 1nW.

Requiring I2(L) = ε in (2) yields a relation between the
incident power I1(0) and the power of the Stokes wave

I2(0) in terms of a transcendental equation. We shall
denote this relation by

The function B can be approximated, for low input in-
tensities, by

I2(0) = B(I1(0)).

I2(0) = εegLI1(0)

This approximation is good as long as εegLI1(0) << I1(0)
i. e. for small enough incident intensities I1(0), and can
be obtained as well by the non-depleted pump approxi-
mation.

Equations (1) neglect losses in the ﬁber. One of the
outcomes of losses in the ﬁber is the existence of a thresh-
old for SBS. It starts only if the incident beam is intense
enough. Otherwise,
losses suppress the Stokes wave.
Moreover, the transfer of energy from the incident beam
to the Stokes wave lasts only while the intensity of the
incident wave remains above the threshold. Losses are
also known to shorten the eﬀective length of the ﬁber, so
the physical length in 4 is replaced by an eﬀective length
[2]

where α is the ﬁber loss coeﬃcient.

Second order SBS requires a three optical wave model.
The coupled wave equations for the intensities are given
by [19, 25]:

the boundary conditions. For a system without feedback
I3 has the initial value of ε at z = 0 and grows as z in-
creases, whereas I2 decays as z increases, keeping their
product small all the way to z = L.

For a system without feedback or gain, the second or-
der SBS is weak compared to the pump and to the ﬁrst
order SBS. Indeed, from the second relation of Eq. 7 one
obtains

(3)

(4)

I3(z) = I1(0)

ε
I1(z)

(9)

Since I1(0) and I1(z) are roughly of the same order of
magnitude, one concludes that the second order SBS
I3(z) is not high above the noise level ε.

To verify Eq.(9), we measured I3 using a very simple
experimental setup shown in Fig. 1. The ﬁber we used
was SMF-28, of 25 kilometers long. The output spectrum
at Z = L, shown in Fig. 2, is composed of three wave-
lengths, I3(L), I1(L) and the reﬂections from the input
isolator of the ﬁrst Stokes wave I2. In Fig. 3 we have
plotted I3(L) vs. I1(0) . In the range of input intensities
we have applied, I1(L) was weakly dependent on I1(0)
and was about 1.5mW. We observe that I3(L) changes
linearly with I1(0) as expected from Eq. (9). The slope
can be related to ε to yield ε ≈ 1nW .

tunately the three integration constants appearing in the
solution are again transcendental functions of the bound-
ary conditions. One can easily verify that

In spite of the similarity of the terms gI1I2 and gI2I3

We thus summarize that a cascaded SBS beyond the
ﬁrst order SBS without feedback elements is very weak.
Nevertheless we show below that with proper boundary
conditions with one reﬂector, strong higher order SBS
can be generated.

same reﬂectivity. Knowing the input power to our sys-
tem and the reﬂection function of the grating is suﬃcient
to calculate the output spectra of both output1 and out-
put2. We expect to obtain at output port 2 a multiple-
peaks spectrum, with a 10.3GHz spacing, each of power
Ith, since we took a long enough ﬁber for the incident
wave to be exhausted down to the SBS threshold power.
At output port 1 we should also see a multiple-peaks
spectrum. The ﬁrst peak is due to the direct reﬂection
from the Bragg grating of the input laser with power of
Iin·r, and all the rest are the back scattered Stokes waves.
In Figs. 6,7 we show the output spectra from ports 1 and
2. The central four strong lines belong to the input and
the ﬁrst three SBS orders. We can see additional two
weaker lines at the right side giving the 4th and 5th SBS
orders, and at outpot port 2 additional three four-wave
mixing products, resulting mainly from the mixing of the
input wave with the strong ﬁrst SBS orders.

We have seen that the Stokes waves generated by SBS
don’t generate their own Stokes waves because of the op-
posite growth direction along the ﬁber of the ”pump” and
its SBS product. One way to cascade many Brillouin
scattered waves is by intervening in the setup, causing
every set of waves to resemble a two wave system. Fig.
4 represents a suggested setup we check experimentally.
The input laser beam enters the system through a ﬁber
Bragg grating. The initial wave that start the cascading
process is obtained at the output of the grating. We will
denote this wave as I1. It propagates to the right, gen-
erates a Stokes wave I2 that propagates to the left. We
know that I2 doesn’t generates its own Stokes, however
when I2 is reﬂected back from the grating it will create
a Stokes wave travelling again to the left, since after the
reﬂection the waves I3 and I4 behave according to the
two wave system equations. I3 begins with a large power
at the Bragg grating and is depleted only by its Stokes
wave I4, which means that the coupled equations for two
waves can be used. This behavior is repeated for I3 and
I4, I5 and I6 and so on. From understanding how this
system works we can easily conclude that the coupling
between every pair of waves is only through the bound-
ary conditions of each pair. For the ﬁrst pair the known
boundary conditions are given by I1(0) and I2(lef f ), and
for the second pair by I2(0), which is the solution of the
ﬁrst pair, and by I3(lef f ) and so on. Each pair of waves
gets it boundary condition from the solution of the pre-
vious pair.

We ﬁrst present the experimental result showing the
generation of strong high orders. The experimental setup
is given in Fig. 5. We used a 25km long single-mode ﬁber.
Since every Stokes wave is down shifted by 10.3GHz from
its ”pump”, we used a broadband Bragg grating which
can reﬂect all the Stokes waves with approximately the

For the theoretical part we write the coupled wave
equations. We solved numerically the equations for the
ﬁrst eight waves in the system and compared them to the
experiment.

We don’t elaborate here on the simulation results, that
will be given elsewhere, but note that they show a plau-
sible match, although not complete, to the experiments.
There remains questions and ingredients that have to
be considered. An important point is the way that the
seeding noise is incorporated into the system. In a re-
alistic model it should be taken as a stochastic source
distributed along the ﬁber. Additionally, other elements,
such as four-wave mixing and losses, should be included
in some cases in the calculations.

IV. BRILLOUIN LASER

Understanding the simple cascading process for the
multiple Stokes waves can lead to a much more eﬃcient
setup for creating the multi wavelength comb of Brillouin
Stokes waves. The setup, shown in Fig. 8 is in the form
of a long laser with feedback in both sides of the cav-
ity, and an external injected seed to start the scattering
process. When the laser operates without the externally

Stokes waves develop. In addition to the high order SBS
it is also possible to have products of four-wave mixing
(4WM). Every two SBS waves, can generate a new wave
by 4WM. The result are waves with the same frequency
spacing, but here also with a possible positive frequency
shift; thus also getting new lines with higher frequencies
(or lower wavelengths).

In Fig. 9 we show the output of the Brillouin laser de-
scribed above. Comparing the spectrum of the Brillouin
laser to that of the multi Stokes open system (Fig. (7) we
see the numerous number of Brillouin lines and also the
lines generated by four-wave mixing (4WM), especially
those above the input frequency.

In this experiment we used a chirped grating for one of
the ’mirrors’ and deliberately chose a grating that com-
pensates for the dispersion of one round trip in the laser,
this selection increased the amplitude of the 4WM terms
compared to the same laser with a non-chirped grating,
but had no eﬀect on the terms created by SBS. We tested
this view to show that SBS terms are phased matched
and that the peaks we see are mostly SBS and not other
non-linear phenomena.

V. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

We have demonstrated that the SBS process does not
cascade by itself in open system conﬁgurations due to
the power proﬁle of the waves in optical ﬁbers.
In or-
der to cascade the SBS process we must intervene in the
system to change the basic conﬁguration of the interact-
ing waves. One way of achieving this is by the use of
a Bragg reﬂector which changes the power proﬁle to be
favorable for the generation of higher stokes reﬂection.
In this simple setup each pair of waves, signal and its
Stokes, can be treated as a simple SBS reﬂection and all
pairs are related through the boundary conditions of the
setup. The boundary condition relations make it sim-
ple to design the output power of each Stokes wave by
changing the input power and the Bragg reﬂector’s re-
ﬂectivity. We have also demonstrated a closed system of
a laser conﬁguration which is much more eﬃcient than
the non-feedback setup and can generate many more SBS
reﬂections, but is not as simple to analyze and design.

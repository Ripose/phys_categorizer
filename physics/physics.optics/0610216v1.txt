The Zeeman splitting and the underlying value of the g-factor for conduction band electrons in
GaAs/AlxGa1−xAs quantum wells have been measured by spin-beat spectroscopy based on a time-
resolved Kerr rotation technique. The experimental data are in good agreement with theoretical
predictions. The model accurately accounts for the large electron energies above the GaAs conduc-
tion band bottom, resulting from the strong quantum conﬁnement. In the tracked range of optical
transition energies E from 1.52 to 2.0 eV, the electron g-factor along the growth axis follows closely
the universal dependence g||(E) ≈ 0.445 + 3.38(E − 1.519) − 2.21(E − 1.519)2 (with E measured
in eV); and this universality also embraces AlxGa1−xAs alloys. The in-plane g-factor component
deviates notably from the universal curve, with the degree of deviation controlled by the structural
anisotropy.

INTRODUCTION

The Lande or g-factor of carriers in a solid is one of
the fundamental properties of this material1,2,3. For con-
duction band electrons in semiconductors and semicon-
ductor heterostructures it may deviate strongly from the
free electron g-factor in vacuum g0 = +2.0023 due to the
spin-orbit interaction, e. g. it is -0.44 in GaAs, -1.64 in
CdTe and can be as large as -51 in the narrow band gap
semiconductor InSb5.

Invention of spintronics has increased the interest in
spin manipulation in semiconductor heterostructures2,4
the carrier g-factors.
and therefore in control of
GaAs/AlxGa1−xAs heterostructures are very suitable for
this purpose as with increasing carrier conﬁnement the
electron g-factor’s absolute value decreases and even
crosses zero. Therefore, the Zeeman splitting can be fully
suppressed by a proper choice of structure design param-
eters and/or external conditions like strain, temperature,
electric ﬁeld, and orientation of the structure in external
magnetic ﬁeld6,7,8.

The electron g-factor in GaAs/AlxGa1−x quantum well
(QW) structures has been measured by various experi-
mental techniques such as spin-ﬂip Raman scattering9,
optical orientation10,11,12,13, optically detected magnetic
resonance14,15, spin quantum beats in emission16,17,18,19,
in absorption20, or in Kerr rotation21,22. However, most
of these studies have been limited to certain widths of the
quantum wells and only in a few papers the well width
dependence of the g-factor has been reported10,17,19,22.

considerations24,25,26,27. The model calculations predict

the Kane model23,

including a
a strong variation of the g-factor value,
sign reversal in the GaAs/AlxGa1−x heterosystem, and
of its anisotropy with well width. Both quantities are
controlled by the strength of electron conﬁnement in
the QWs determined mostly by the well width and
barrier height.
These theoretical predictions were
further substantiated by experimental data19,22,28,29.
The published results are commonly presented as a
dependence of the g-factor value on the QW width, i.e.
a set of diﬀerent dependencies corresponding to diﬀerent
barrier heights (controlled by the Al content) is required
to cover the whole range of possible QW structures.
In CdTe/Cd1−xMgxTe heterostructures, whose band
structure is similar to that of GaAs/AlxGa1−x struc-
tures, to a good approximation a universal dependence
of the electron g-factor on the heterostructure band gap
(i.e., on the energy of the optical transition between the
ground states of conﬁned electrons (e1) and holes (hh1))
has been reported30: the g-factor was sensitive mostly
to the value of the band gap itself, but not to the way
how this gap has been obtained by the structure’s design
parameters.

The goal of this paper is to check experimentally and
theoretically, whether this universality can be extended
to GaAs/AlxGa1−x heterosystems, and if yes, what the
origins of this universality are. We present experimental
results for the time-resolved pump-probe Kerr rotation,
which allow us to determine the transverse component
g⊥ of the electron g-factor with high accuracy from the
frequency of the spin precession in an external magnetic
ﬁeld. Model calculations accounting for the k · p inter-
action between lowest conduction band and the upper
valence bands have been performed for the longitudi-
nal and transverse components of the electron g-factor

in structures with the Al content varied from 0 to 0.45.
We found that for the longitudinal component a univer-
sal dependence is strongly supported. At the same time,
the transverse component deviates notably from a uni-
versal curve, with the degree of deviation controlled by
the structural anisotropy.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

The GaAs/AlxGa1−x heterostructures have been
grown by molecular-beam epitaxy on (100) oriented
GaAs substrates. The sample parameters are collected
in Table I. Samples #1 and #2 consist of several sin-
gle QWs of diﬀerent width separated by 50 nm thick
AlxGa1−xAs barriers to prevent electronic coupling be-
tween the wells. Samples #3, #4 and #5 contain only
one QW. All structures are nominally undoped, but
due to residual doping of the barriers presence of back-
ground electrons in the QWs has been established from
the observation of emission of negatively charged exci-
tons. The background electrons density does not exceed
5 × 109 cm−2.

For optical measurements the samples were immersed
in pumped liquid helium at a temperature of 1.6 K, and
magnetic ﬁelds up to 7 T were applied perpendicular to
the structure growth axis (Voigt geometry). The struc-
tures were characterized by means of photoluminescence
(PL) excited by 532 nm laser light with an excitation
density below 0.3 W/cm2.

The electron g-factor was evaluated from the frequency
of the electron spin quantum beats corresponding to the
Larmor precession frequency in magnetic ﬁeld. A pump-
probe technique with polarization sensitivity based on
time-resolved Kerr rotation was used for detection of the
spin beats (see e. g. Refs. 2,31). A Ti:Sapphire laser
emitting 1.8 ps pulses at a repetition rate of 75.6 MHz
was tuned in resonance with the QW exciton transition.
The pump beam was circularly polarized by means of an
elasto-optical modulator operating at 50 kHz. The exci-
tation density was kept as low as possible in the range
from 0.2 to 1 W/cm2. The probe beam was linearly po-
larized, its intensity was about 20% of the pump beam.
The rotation angle of the linearly polarized probe pulse
reﬂected from the sample due to the Kerr rotation, was
detected by a balanced diode detector and a lock-in am-
pliﬁer. The time-resolved Kerr rotation signal as func-
tion of the delay between probe and pump pulses gives
the evolution of the electron spin coherence generated by
the pump.

nescence from the QWs is dominated by recombination
of excitons, whose energy increases for the narrow QWs
due to conﬁnement. The low energy shoulders of the ex-
citonic lines are due to the negatively charged excitons
(trions) recombination32. Trions consisting of two elec-
trons and a hole are formed by a background electron
and a photogenerated exciton.

resonant with the exciton transition. The periodic oscil-
lations of the Kerr signal are due to the precession of co-
herently excited electron spins about the magnetic ﬁeld,
with the oscillation period TL given by the spin splitting
in the conduction band ∆E. Therefore, the Larmor pre-
cession frequency ωL = 2π/TL allows precise determina-
tion of the transverse component of the electron g-factor
g⊥ by

∆E = µBg⊥B = ~ωL,

(1)

where µB is the Bohr magneton. Note that the sign of
the g-factor cannot be determined, but only its absolute
value. For that purpose, we ﬁt the spin-beat dynamics
by form for an exponentially damped oscillation. In case
of a single frequency and a single decay time, which gives
an appropriate description for most of the studied struc-
tures, this form is given by the following equation:

y(t) = Aexp(−t/τ )cos(ωLt),

(2)

with an amplitude A. τ is the decay time of spin coher-
ence, which for an electron spin ensemble corresponds to
2,33. An example for the re-
the spin dephasing time T ∗

sult of a ﬁtting to the experiment is given in Fig. 2 by the
thick grey line. Here we exclude from the analysis the ini-
tial 15-30 ps after the pump pulse, which are contributed
by the fast relaxation of holes18,34,35.

In the inset, the determined Zeeman splitting is plot-
ted as a function of magnetic ﬁeld. The corresponding
values of the Larmor frequency are also given on the right
vertical axis. The slope of the B-linear dependence gives
|g⊥| = 0.26 ± 0.005. The decay time of the spin beats in
Fig. 2 is 880 ps and is considerably longer than the radia-
tive decay of resonantly excited excitons which does not
exceed 100 ps in GaAs/AlxGa1−xAs QWs36. Therefore,
we conclude that the detected spin beats are provided by

background electrons whose spin coherence is photogen-
erated by the trion formation33.

from the GaAs buﬀer layer superimposed by the QW signal.
The experimental data are shown by the narrow black lines
and ﬁt results by the forms discussed in the text are given by
the thick gray lines. Inset: Relative intensities of the beats
from the QW (closed circles) and the GaAs buﬀer layer (open

Not in all cases the Kerr signals can be described by
a single frequency and/or single decay time. Figure 3 il-

lustrates a more complicated case observed in sample #5
for a 8.8 nm wide QW. The excitation energy of 1.515 eV
is resonant with the exciton transition of the GaAs buﬀer
layer and the observed oscillations with |g⊥| = 0.44 are
in accord with the known g-factor value of bulk GaAs
g(GaAs)= −0.445. The decay of the spin beats shows two
characteristic times. The fast one of 360 ps may be asso-
ciated with the exciton lifetime and the long one, which
exceeds 3 ns describes the dephasing of the background
electrons in the buﬀer layer37. The resonant excitation
into the exciton states of GaAs results in the largest am-
plitude of the Kerr signal. However, pronounced spin
beats can be observed when the excitation energy is de-
tuned from the resonance condition and shifted further
up by 27 meV to the energy of 1.543 eV, which is still
below any QW resonance. The Kerr signal at these
energies is provided by the exciton-polariton reﬂection
spectrum38, which is governed by the quantization of po-
laritons in the GaAs buﬀer layer. The spin beats period is
independent of the excitation energy, as it is determined
by spin oriented carriers, which relax from the excited
states to the bottom of the conduction band and precess
there with |g⊥| = 0.44. The amplitude of the Kerr signal,
however, decreases, as shown by the open circles in the
inset.

An increase of the laser energy to 1.553 eV brings it
in resonance with the QW exciton. The beats period
increases about twice corresponding to |g⊥,1| = 0.21. The
spin beats are damped with a decay time τ = 410 ps. At
longer delays exceeding 1000 ps the oscillation picture
becomes irregular, suggesting that at least two periodic
processes overlap. The signal was ﬁtted by an equation
accounting for two frequencies with diﬀerent decay times:

y(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1)cos(ωL,1t + ϕ1)
+A2exp(−t/τ2)cos(ωL,2t + ϕ2).

(3)

As one can see from the ﬁt in Fig. 3 shown by the grey
lines, the experiment at longer delays can be described
by spin beats of QW electrons with |g⊥,1| = 0.21 super-
imposed with |g⊥,1| = 0.42 beats. The latter beats can
be attributed to electrons precessing in the GaAs buﬀer.
The relative intensities of the amplitudes A1 and A2 are
given in the inset of Fig. 3.

To obtain further insight, a 13 nm wide QW in sample
#2 has been excited resonantly with three optical tran-
sitions corresponding to the ground state of the heavy-
hole exciton (e1−hh1), of the light-hole exciton (e1−lh1)
and of the exciton related to the second conﬁned electron
and levels (e2 − hh2). For all cases spin beats with al-
most the same period corresponding to |g⊥| = 0.33 have
been found (see Table I). As the value of the electron
g- factor should strongly depend on the electron energy,
we therefore conclude that the Kerr signal is provided
by electrons which relax to the bottom of the conduc-
tion band shortly after the photogeneration and precess
there.
It is remarkable that the e1 electron precession
can be accessed through the e2 − hh2 optical transition.

thicknesses (samples #1 and #2) measured in a magnetic
ﬁeld of 2 T. Well width, excitation energy and g-factor value
are indicated for each signal. T = 1.6 K.

After having given some insight into the general fea-
tures of the experimental data and their analysis, we turn
to the problem of the g-factor dependence on the carrier
conﬁnement conditions. Time-resolved Kerr rotation sig-
nals detected for the laser energy resonant with the ex-
citon optical transitions in QWs of diﬀerent width are
given in Fig. 4. One can see that the spin beats fre-
quency, which is proportional to |g⊥| of the conduction
band electrons, decreases with decreasing well width. Os-
cillations cannot be resolved in a 5.1 nm QW with the
exciton energy at 1.600 eV. A further decrease of the QW
width down to 4.2 nm restores the spin beat oscillations.
The determined |g⊥| values are given in the ﬁgure and
are collected also in Table I.

The experimental values for |g⊥| are plotted in Fig. 5
as function of excitation energy. Most of the data, ex-
cept for some results for a 13 nm QW and the GaAs
buﬀer which were measured for non-resonant excitation,
were detected when the laser was resonant with the exci-
ton state e1 − hh1. Measurements on diﬀerent structures
conﬁrm the monotonic decrease of the g-factor absolute
value with increasing energy leading to a sign reversal
at 1.600 eV. Our results are in good agreement with the
data of Snelling et al.10 obtained by the optical orienta-
tion technique. They are also in good agreement with
model calculations for Al contents of x = 0.3 and 0.35
shown by the solid and the dashed lines, respectively.
Details of these calculations are given below in Sec. IV.
We note that the calculated dependencies are plotted as
function of energy of the optical transition between the
conﬁned carrier levels e1 and hh1 without accounting for
the exciton binding energy. The latter may shift these

IV. CALCULATION OF THE ELECTRONIC
g-FACTOR AND COMPARISON WITH
EXPERIMENT.

Here we present results of model calculations for the
longitudinal and transverse components of the electronic
g-factor in GaAs/AlxGa1−xAs QWs for a wide range of
well widths from 1 to 30 nm and Al contents 0 < x <
0.45, which control the barrier height. In Fig. 6 the calcu-
lated g-factors are shown as function of the e1-hh1 optical
transition energy. This provides a convenient comparison
with experiment, as the g-factor is addressed in depen-
dence of an easily measurable quantity.

To prepare Fig. 6, it was necessary, ﬁrst, to calculate
accurately the lowest quantized states of electrons and
heavy holes for each set of heterostructure parameters,
and, second, to evaluate the g-factor tensor for the cal-
culated electron state. To achieve advanced accuracy in
the energy levels, we applied the Kane multiband Hamil-
tonian, accounting exactly for the coupling between the
lowest conduction band Γ6 and the upper valence bands
Γ8 and Γ7, and retaining also all remote band terms
that notably aﬀect the dispersion of the relevant quasi-
particles in conduction and valence band. Details of the
computational procedure were presented elsewhere40,41.
Then by directly following the prescriptions in Ref. 26,

bottom of the ﬁrst electron subband in the QW structure

Numeric values for all applicable quantities are collected
in Table II for GaAs and Al0.35Ga0.65As (the data are
taken from Ref. 5). The following scheme for parameter
evaluation has been adopted for an arbitrary Al com-
position x: for most of the parameters (named basic in
Table II), we use a simple linear interpolation (extrapola-
tion for x > 0.35). This group contains the interband mo-
mentum matrix element Pcv and the spin-orbit splitting
∆SO in the valence band. Rigorously speaking, higher
accuracy can probably be achieved if also the bowing
constants for the interpolation curves were known, but
for the studied range 0 < x < 0.45 linear interpolations
should be suﬃcient. As the only notable exception, we
use the common interpolation equation with bowing term

^
for the AlxGa1−xAs band gap5:

with Eg measured in eV.

Eg(x) = 1.519 + 1.04x + 0.47x2[eV ].

Some parameters are obviously model derivatives and
we denote them composite: the bulk electron eﬀective
mass mbulk and the bulk g-factor gbulk are deﬁned by a
subset of basic quantities. These composite parameters
are not expected to follow a linear interpolation law, so
we apply a diﬀerent approach: when we need the value
of a composite parameter for some alloy composition, we
directly calculate it from interpolated basic parameters.
For example42,

gbulk = g0 −

P 2
cv
m0

∆SO
Eg(Eg + ∆SO)

+ δgremote

(5)

where m0 is mass of free electron in vacuum and δgremote
is a correction due to the higher lying bands. First, we
use the speciﬁc numerical values of gbulk from Table II
and Eq. (5) to evaluate δgremote (which is treated here
as basic and interpolated when necessary). Then, we
apply Eq. (5) again to calculate gbulk for arbitrary al-
loy composition from a complete set of interpolated ba-
sic parameters. The heavy hole eﬀective mass mhh is
taken to be independent of the alloy composition. A ra-
tio ∆EC /∆EV = 60/40 for the oﬀsets in the conduction
and valence bands was taken for the calculations43.

Let us now describe in detail the results summarized
in Fig. 6. Here the two independent components of the
g-factor tensor are shown for the electron conﬁned in
QWs with diﬀerent barrier composition x as function of
the e1 − hh1 optical transition energy. The components
for magnetic ﬁeld applied parallel (g||) and perpendicular
(g⊥) to the structure growth axis are given by the solid
and dashed lines, respectively. For each composition of
the barrier material g⊥ > g||. The lowest energy for the
optical transition is achieved for an inﬁnitely wide QW,
for which the energy asymptotically approaches that of
bulk GaAs (1.519 eV at T = 1.6 K) and both g tensor
components converge to meet the electron g-factor value
in the bulk: g(GaAs)= −0.44. Therefore, for each x value
the curves for the two g- factor components form a petal
with the root corresponding to the principal band gap
and the g-factor of bulk GaAs and the tip corresponding
to the values of the AlxGa1−xAs barriers (limit of a very
narrow QW). As the band gap and the g-factor both
grow monotonously with the Al composition, the petal
size also increases and its tip draws the line gbulk(Eg) cor-
responding to the bulk g-factor value for a range of alloy
compositions (shown in Fig. 6 by a thick solid line, open
circles are experimental data for AlxGa1−xAs alloys44).
Implicitly, the thick solid line in Fig. 6 is deﬁned by
Eq. (5): assuming linear interpolations for Pcv, ∆SO
and δgremote, and the composition dependence for Eg(x)
given by Eq. (4), gbulk(Eg) can be easily recovered analyt-
ically as a series expansion. For the GaAs/AlxGa1−xAs
heterosystem, the ﬁrst terms in the expansion are5:
gbulk(Eg) ≈ −0.445+3.38(Eg−1.519)−2.21(Eg−1.519)2,
(6)

Quite remarkably, the growth direction component
g||(Ee1−hh1) follows very closely the AlxGa1−xAs de-
pendence gbulk(Eg) for an arbitrary barrier composition.
The inset in Fig. 6 shows a close-up of the energy de-
pendence of g|| for diﬀerent x. It illustrates that the g||
values for the whole range of x from 0 up to 0.45 basically
coincide, besides minor deviations, with the dependence
for bulk AlxGa1−xAs.

Although g⊥ follows generally the same trend, it de-
viates notably from the alloy dependence. This devia-
tion is caused by the structural anisotropy in the struc-
ture:
therefore it depends on the barrier height and
strength of spatial conﬁnement. However, for the studied
GaAs/AlxGa1−xAs QWs the maximum deviation of g⊥
from the bulk dependence is always moderate, and never
exceeds 0.3. Also, in the immediate vicinity of the petal
root (corresponding to the case of very weak spatial con-
ﬁnement and negligible penetration of the electron state
into barriers) some universality with respect to diﬀerent
barrier compositions can be spotted for g⊥.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In order to assess the meaning and the validity of the
universal dependence of the g-factor on the heterostruc-
ture band gap, let us ﬁrst consider a hypothetical alloy
heterosystem AxB1−x. We assume that the system can
be accurately described by the Kane model, in which the
two basic parameters (i) the interband matrix element
Pcv and (ii) the spin-orbit splitting of valence band ∆SO
are plain independent of the composition (consequently,
these quantities will be equal in the well and barrier lay-
ers). Another assumption is that (iii) the valence band
oﬀset is exactly zero. Analysis shows, that for such a re-
markable heterosystem, a truly universal dependence of
the electron g-factor on the e1 − hh1 energy in the QW
structure is expected. Moreover, no g-factor anisotropy
would be expected. We would like to note that similar
universality should also reappear when the barriers in the
heterostructures are extremely high, preventing consid-
erable penetration of the electron wave function into the
barriers.

In reality, conditions (i)-(iii) are not satisﬁed, so that
the degree of the parameter mismatch (along with the ex-
tent of the penetration of a conﬁned electron into the bar-
rier layers) governs the deviations from the universal be-
haviour when one changes barrier composition and QW
width. The matrix element Pcv is modiﬁed only moder-
ately from one semiconductor to another and the modu-
lation in the value of ∆SO is almost negligible in cation-
substituted materials, including the AlxGa1−xAs alloys.
However,
it can be considerable in anion-substituted
solid solutions5. Condition (iii) appears to be most vul-
nerable, as the valence band oﬀset accounts for about
40% of the diﬀerence in band gaps for the well and
barrier materials in GaAs/AlxGa1−xAs heterostructures,

but some approximate universality can be reasonably ex-
pected. The profound universality in the behavior of the
growth direction component of the electron g-factor in
GaAs/AlxGa1−xAs QWs, even though it is not exact,
obviously exceeds these expectations. A detailed numer-
ical analysis shows that it appears due to a fragile and
delicate balance in the dependence of the material pa-
rameters on composition: when the band gap increases
with Al content, slight reductions of Pcv and ∆SO counter
play and mostly compensate the eﬀect of moderate but
nonzero valence band oﬀset in the type I band alignment
at the heterointerface, the particular experimental value
of mhh also helps.

To conclude the discussion, approximate universalities
in the g-factor behavior can be expected in general for
cation-substituted alloy heterostructures with a type I
band alignment and small-to-moderate valence band oﬀ-
sets. Heterosystems with these properties are known to
include a number of important III-V and II-VI ternary
semiconductors. However, one should be cautious about
an indiscriminate extension of these conclusions to arbi-
trary materials.

In summary, the electronic g-factor has been studied
experimentally and theoretically in GaAs/AlxGa1−xAs

7

QWs for a wide range of well widths and Al contents. The
results are represented as a g-factor dependence on the
energy of the e1 − hh1 optical transition in QWs. A re-
markable universality has been established for the g ten-
sor components along the structure growth axis g||. The
deviation of the transverse components g⊥ from this uni-
versal behavior is controlled by the structure anisotropy.

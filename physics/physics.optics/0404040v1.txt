Nonlinear losses accompanying Kerr self-focusing substantially impacts the dynamic balance of
diﬀraction and nonlinearity, permitting the existence of localized and stationary solutions of the
2D+1 nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation which are stable against radial collapse. These are featured
by linear Bessel-like tails of unequal inward and outward Hankel beam components, that continually
reﬁll the nonlinear, central spot.

PACS numbers: 42.65.Re, 42.65.Tg

One of the main goals of modern nonlinear optics,
and wave physics in general, is the achievement of sta-
tionary and stable propagation of localized wave pack-
ets over long distances.
In the last decade, great ef-
forts have been made in order to extend the soliton dy-
namics from optical ﬁbers to propagation in bulk me-
dia. While in a one-dimensional geometry, Kerr nonlin-
earity suitably balances linear dispersive eﬀects, it leads
to either instability or collapse in the multidimensional
case, until higher order nonlinear eﬀects, as Kerr satu-
ration, plasma-induced defocusing, or stimulated Raman
scattering, quench them. These stabilizing mechanisms,
however, are shown to bring energy losses, which lead
to the termination of the soliton regime, or preclude its
formation.

The natural question then arises of whether any sta-
tionary and localized wave propagation is possible in
the presence of nonlinear losses (NLL). The response, as
shown in this letter, is aﬃrmative. The stationary waves,
however, cannot be ascribed to the class of solitary, self-
trapped waves, but are instead nonlinear conical waves,
whose stationarity is sustained by a continuous reﬁlling
of the nonlinearly absorbed central spot with the energy
supplied by linear, conical tails. These waves are not only
robust against NLL, but ﬁnd their stabilizing mechanism
against perturbations in NLL themselves.

In linear optics, the idea underlying a wave proﬁle sta-
tionary against losses is implicit in the self-reconstruction
property of Bessel beams [1, 2]. This property has been
related to the decomposition of a Bessel beam as two
Hankel beams of equal amplitudes carrying energy out-
wards and towards a line source (sink) on the propaga-
tion axis [3]. After a central obturation, it is the inward
Hankel component that generates the outward one on
crossing the axis, since no physical sink exists, restor-
ing the whole Bessel beam.
In nonlinear physics, ex-
tensive computer studies on wave collapses led to pre-
diction of a stationary, post-collaptical (hence singular)
solution of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (NLSE),
[4] under the conditions of “super-strong” collapse, char-
acterized by a constant energy ﬂux into the singularity.
The only related result combining linear and nonlinear

approaches for the achievement of localization and sta-
tionarity is the discovery of nonlinear X-waves in loss-
less media [5]. Diﬀerently from solitons, stationarity is
supported by a “nonlocal” balance between the nonlinear
phase shift, built at the bright central spot, and the linear
one, arising from the peculiar geometry of the weak con-
ical tails. Also, recent experiments on spontaneous light
ﬁlamentation in water [6] have revealed that the ﬁlament
is not a soliton-like, self-trapped beam. The insertion of
apertures and stoppers in the ﬁlament path evidenced
that the ﬁlament cannot survive without the surround-
ing radiation, and suggested that NLL may play a key
role in the collapse stabilization, driving in combination
with Kerr self-focusing, a spontaneous transformation of
a Gaussian beam into a (presumed) conical beam [6].

In the frame of the 2D+1 NLSE ruling nonlinear light
beam propagation with NLL, we conﬁrm here that NLL
prevents ﬁnite-power, self-guided beams from stationar-
ity, and show that the only possible asymptotic form of
the stationary and localized waves with NLL must be
that of an “unbalanced” Bessel beam (UBB), character-
ized by a reduced ring visibility and a constant energy
ﬂux towards the beam axis, because of the unequal am-
plitudes of its inward and outward Hankel components.
The cone angle is generally limited by a lower bound for
this kind of “dynamic” stability to be possible. The exis-
tence of these solutions and their stability against small
perturbations are veriﬁed in the important case of prop-
agation in Kerr media with NLL.

To start with, we consider the 2D+1 NLSE

sence of NLL (β(K) = 0), this condition demands plane
phase fronts (φ′ = 0) and no radial energy ﬂux. This is
the case of the ﬁnite-energy, sech-type Townes proﬁle in
transparent Kerr media [7], associated to negative wave
vector shift δ, and of weakly localized Bessel beams in
transparent linear or Kerr media (recently described in
[8]), with inﬁnite power and positive wave vector shift δ.
With NLL, instead, the conditions of reﬁlling (6) and
localization [a(r)
] require an inward
radial power [l.h.s of (6)] that monotonically increases
with r up to reach, at inﬁnity, a constant value equal
to the total NLL, N∞, assumed they are ﬁnite. Sta-
tionarity with NLL is thus supported by the continu-
ous reﬁlling of the more strongly absorbed inner part of
the beam with the energy coming from its outer part.
Phase fronts cannot be plane, since φ′

We stress that this asymptotic analysis holds irrespec-
tive of the nonlinear phase terms in the NLSE (Kerr non-
linearity, Kerr saturation, . . . ), since they rely on the
only assumption of ﬁnite NLL. We can therefore state
that the conical UBB represents the only possible asymp-
totic form of stationary and localized waves in nonlinear
media when the eﬀects of NLL are taken into considera-
tion. Note that the case of linear losses is excluded, since
N∞ =
for K = 1. It should be also clear that the ac-
tual existence of a stationary solution of the NLSE, and
the characteristics of its linear asymptotic UBB (cone an-
gle, αin and αout) depends on the particular nonlinear
phase terms in the NLSE [or, in terms of the mechanical
analogous, on whether the nonlinear particle dynamics at
small “time” r leads to oscilatory motion in the potential
well V (b) at large r].

As the simplest case, we solved numerically (4) and
(5) without the Kerr term, to appreciate the eﬀects of
pure NLL (Fig. 1). We found that localized solutions

the radial proﬁle becomes undistinguishable from that
of the UBB of same δ, matched NLL N∞ and contrast
C. Then, pure NLL creates a gap in the allowed UBB
2δ/k that increases with intensity [Fig.
cone angles θ =
1(b)], and that becomes signiﬁcant at intensities compa-
rable to the characteristic intensity (k/β(K))1/(K−1). In-
tuitively, the gap in cone angle originates from the fact
that the stationary proﬁles become wider and less local-
ized [Fig. 1(c)] as the cone angle diminishes. This makes
the total NLL N∞ to increase, a situation that cannot be
0),
sustained down to the limit of zero cone angle (δ
which could not allow for any radial energy ﬂux. In fact,
as the cone angle diminishes down to the lower bound,
the weights αout and αin of the Hankel components are
found to approach zero and inﬁnity, respectively; hence
the rings gradually smoothen, while the total NLL in-
crease without bound [see Figs. 1(c) and (d)].

The extension to include nonlinear phase terms in the
NLSE can be readily understood from the case of pure
NLL. Figure 2(a, solid curve) shows the permitted cones
angles in the case of focusing Kerr nonlinearity (n2 > 0),
obtained from numerical integration of (4) and (5) with
K = 4 (similar results hold for other values of K). The
modiﬁcation of the allowed region of cone angles can be
attributed to the nonlinear phase shift at the central spot.

Figure 3 shows a typical eigenvalue spectrum for axi-
symmetric perturbations (m = 0) to three stationary
solutions with same Kerr nonlinearity (g = 1) and in-
creasing four-photon (K = 4) absorption [γ = 0, 0.1,
0.2]. Eigenvalues with ImΩ = 0 are not shown for
clarity. Clearly, the eﬀect of NLL is to decrease the
imaginary part of the eigenvalues, driving the system to-
wards stability. The Bessel-like solutions in pure Kerr
media (squares), whose stability has not been previ-
ously studied, are indeed unstable. At the NLL strength
γ = 0.1 (stars), however, the positive imaginary parts
are strongly reduced, and at γ = 0.2 (circles) no signs of
instability are present.

We performed the same analysis for m = 1, 2, . . . For
dipolar (m = 1) perturbation no instability emerges nei-
ther in the pure Kerr nor in the Kerr + NLL model. In
contrast, both systems resulted to be unstable respect to

fact that higher-order modes manifest themselves as in-
tensity modulation far from the central hot spot, where
the intensity is low and so NLL play indeed a minor role.
In conclusion, we have reported the existence of sta-
tionary and localized solutions of the NLSE for nonlinear
light beam propagation in the presence of NLL, which
diﬀerently from spatial solitons, are asymptotically lin-
ear conical beams, and are endowed of an inward radial
energy ﬂow that continually reﬁll the hot, nonlinear spot.
Furthermore we have seen that NLL act as a stabilizing
mechanism in the dynamic balance between diﬀraction
and Kerr nonlinearity. The stabilization of the station-
ary solutions against radial perturbations evidences that
NLL can arrest collapse, and hence they can play an im-
portant role, together with other proposed mechanisms,
in the dynamics of light ﬁlaments. In fact, a recent exper-
imental characterization of the spatiotemporal structure
of ﬁlaments showing instantaneous radial modulations
[10], and observations of the spontaneous transformation
of slightly elliptical ﬁlaments into quadrupole structures
[11], support this hypothesis. We ﬁnally stress that ow-
ing to the formal spatiotemporal analogy, these results
directly apply to pulse propagation in nonlinear planar
wave guides with anomalous dispersion. More generally,
we foresee that similar waves should exist also in the case
of 3D+1 NLSE with NLL, describing full spatiotemporal
localization and stationarity (light bullets) in bulk media
with NLL.

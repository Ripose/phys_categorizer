We study the formation of long-lived states near avoided resonance crossings in open systems. For three
different optical microcavities (rectangle, ellipse, and semi-stadium) we provide numerical evidence that these
states are localized along periodic rays, resembling scarred states in closed systems. Our results shed light on
the morphology of long-lived states in open mesoscopic systems.

Understanding the properties of long-lived, quasi-bound
states in open mesoscopic systems is of central importance for
many research subjects, e.g. semiconductor ballistic quantum
dots [1, 2, 3, 4], photoionization of Rydberg atoms [5], mi-
crowave systems [6, 7], quantum chaos [8], and optical micro-
cavities [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In several of these studies
the long-lived states are scarred. The original scarring phe-
nomenon has been discovered for closed systems in the ﬁeld
of quantum chaos [16]. It refers to the existence of a small
fraction of eigenstates with strong localization along unsta-
ble periodic orbits of the underlying classical system. In open
systems, however, scarred states seem to be the rule rather
than the exception. The nature of the mechanism behind this
scar-like phenomenon is not yet understood.

Avoided level crossings in closed or conservative systems
are discussed in textbooks on quantum mechanics. They occur
when the curves of two energy eigenvalues, as function of a
real parameter ∆, come near to crossing but then repel each
other [17]. This behaviour can be understood in terms of a

For a closed system this matrix is Hermitian, thus the energies
Ej are real and the complex off-diagonal elements are related
by W = V ∗. The eigenvalues of the coupled system,

often be safely ignored.

The matrix (1) also captures features of avoided resonance
crossings (ARCs) in open or dissipative systems if one allows
for complex-valued energies Ej. The imaginary part deter-

inary part. At resonance Re(E1) = Re(E2) the eigenvec-
tors of the matrix (1) are symmetric and antisymmetric su-
perpositions of the eigenvectors of the uncoupled system. If
one of the latter corresponds to a localized state then such an
ARC leads to delocalization and lifetime shortening [19]. For
, there is a crossing in the real part

and an avoided crossing in the imaginary part. This kind of
ARC has been exploited to design optical microcavities with
unidirectional light emission from long-lived states [20].

The case W = V ∗ is called internal coupling since the only
difference to the Hermitian coupling of two states in a closed
system is that each state is individually coupled to the con-
tinuum. The latter is described by the imaginary part of the
diagonal elements of matrix (1). The fully nonhermitian case
= V ∗ is more general, it permits an external coupling of
W
the states via the continuum. Figure 1 illustrates that the real
part undergoes an avoided level crossing as in the case of a
closed system. The important feature is that one of the states
has a considerably increased lifetime. The constraint of the
conservation of the trace of the matrix in Eq. (1) simultane-
ously generates a state with short lifetime. The formation of
fast and slowly decaying states is known as resonance trap-
ping, see, e.g., Refs. [21, 22].

The aim of this letter is to show that ARCs due to external
coupling can have a strong impact on the localization proper-
ties of long-lived states in open systems. The symmetric or an-
tisymmetric superpositions are more localized in real or phase
space than the original states, so that important decay chan-
nels are blocked. A surprising ﬁnding is that these states can
resemble scarred states which helps to explain the frequently
observed scarring in open mesoscopic systems.

We examine optical microcavities, where the optical modes
and their frequencies play the role of states and their energies.
Light conﬁnement in microcavities has attracted considerable
interest in recent years due to the huge potential for various re-
search ﬁelds and applications, for a review see Ref. [23]. For
most applications, like low-threshold lasing, long-lived modes
are required. We consider quasi-two-dimensional dielectric
cavities with rectangular, elliptical and stadium-shaped cross
section. We ﬁrst focus on rectangles because of the following
convenient properties: (i) the modes not close to an ARC can
be computed analytically to a good approximation, including
mode pattern and complex frequency; (ii) the internal ray dy-
namics is trivial, so localization effects related to chaotic ray

theoretically [25, 26, 27]. However, ARCs in these systems
have not been addressed so far.

to be n = 3.3 inside and n = 1 outside the dielectric for
the transverse electric (TE) polarization with magnetic ﬁeld
~H perpendicular to the cavity plane. Maxwell’s equations
for the modes Hz(x, y, t) = ψ(x, y)e−iωt reduce to a two-
dimensional scalar wave equation [28]

with frequency ω and the speed of light in vacuum c. The
wave function ψ and its normal derivative times n−2 are con-
tinuous across the boundary of the cavity. At inﬁnity, outgo-
ing wave conditions are imposed. Even though the geome-
try of the cavity is rather simple the wave equation cannot be
solved analytically since the boundary conditions introduce
diffraction at corners. We compute the modes numerically us-
ing the boundary element method [29]. In order to apply this
method each corner is replaced by a quarter of a circle with
radius much smaller than the wavelength. We have carefully
checked that the rounding does not inﬂuence the solutions in
the studied frequency regime.

Before we discuss the numerical solutions of the open cav-
ity we will brieﬂy consider the corresponding closed cavity
with vanishing wave intensity along the boundary. We ex-
pect that the solutions of the closed system approximate those
modes in the open system which are conﬁned by total internal
reﬂection. The closed cavity is called an integrable billiard [7]
since the modes can be computed analytically

As expected for an integrable billiard [7], this system shows
frequency crossings instead of avoided crossings when the as-
pect ratio ε is varied. For example, for the modes (nx, ny) =
(10, 7) and (12, 5) Eq. (5) yields the crossing point ε =
13.12 corresponding to a free-
space wavelength of about 960nm. Figure 2 shows that this
p
accidental degeneracy is lifted in the open cavity. The associ-
ated ARC equals the case of the 2
2 matrix in Fig. 1. We
therefore conclude that diffraction at corners in rectangular
cavities leads to an external coupling of modes.

It has been demonstrated in Ref. [30] that losses from a
polygonal cavity due to diffraction at corners can be esti-
mated by the boundary wave approach. Boundary waves
travel along a ﬂat interface between dielectric material and
air. In the case of an inﬁnitely extended interface, these waves
are evanescent. In the case of a ﬁnite interface, however, these
waves can leave the interface region at the corners. Follow-
ing Ref. [30] we have derived a formula describing the losses
from a given mode (nx, ny) in the rectangular cavity due to
boundary waves

proach as developed in Ref. [30] can only compute the losses
the diagonal elements of the ma-
of individual modes, i.e.
trix (1). The off-diagonal part, i.e.
the coupling of modes,
cannot be determined within this approach. For a direct com-
parison to the exact results in Fig. 2 it is therefore useful to
consider the mean value of Ω+ and Ω− since here the ARC
contributions cancel, cf. Eq. (2). The result of this proce-
dure is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 3. It can be seen that
the averaged boundary wave result overestimates the averaged
lifetimes of the modes by just 20 percent. Hence, leakage due
to boundary waves is the dominant decay channel.

is a dramatic increase by more than one order of magnitude
if compared to the “normal” quality factor. In this frequency
regime the leakage due boundary waves limits the quality fac-
tor to roughly 1900. This indicates that possibly all long-lived
modes (modes with, say, Q
4000) in this frequency regime
are caused by ARCs. This conclusion is supported by exten-
sive numerical studies on this system (not shown).

cavities of very different types: (i) square quantum dots with
leads attached at the corner region [1]; (ii) square billiards
with magnetic ﬂux [31]; (iii) vertical-cavity surface-emitting
lasers with square-shaped cross section [13, 32].

The resemblance of mode C with the diamond-shaped pe-
riodic ray is apparent with the naked eye. In the following,
it will be demonstrated that the relation is even deeper. To
do so, we estimate the frequency of the mode by using the
localization along the ray. We stipulate that an integer num-
ber m of wavelengths ﬁts onto the periodic ray with length
l = 2R√1 + ε2. The calculation is straightforward giving

The quantities α1 and α2 are the same as for Eq. (6) but

Fig. 3 demonstrates that the scar approximation with m = 15
describes the mean behaviour of the modes involved in the
ARC over a broad range of parameter values. The small fre-
quency offset of about 0.086 can be traced back to the fact
that the scar approximation assumes that the plane waves
lying on the ray segments have no wave vector component
in the transverse direction. However, the mode is restricted
to an interval of length R (εR) in x-direction (y-direction).
At least half a wavelength ﬁts into these intervals for which
the wave vector components give frequency contributions of
approximately π/n and π/(εn). Summing up the squares

line is the averaged result of the boundary wave approach (6).

The spatial patterns of modes A, B, E, and F in Fig. 4 ap-
proximately match the solutions of the closed cavity in Eq. (4).
Upon the avoided crossing the mode patterns exchange their
character, i.e. mode B and E have roughly the same spatial
proﬁle but belong to different frequency branches, cf. Fig. 2.
The same holds for mode A and F. The modes at the ARC, C
and D, correspond to symmetric and antisymmetric superposi-
tions of the mode A and B (or E and F). Now, we can identify
the physical mechanism behind the increased quality factor of
mode C: destructive interference reduces the light intensity at
the corners and consequently the main decay channel, leak-
age due to boundary waves, is strongly suppressed. A closer
inspection of the mode C in Fig. 4 reveals that its intensity is
concentrated along a diamond-shaped periodic ray. The long-
lived mode formed in the ARC therefore resembles a scarred
mode. In the case of mode D, constructive interference at the
corners spoils the quality factor. Mode D is localized along
two symmetry-related rays connecting the corners of the cav-
ity. Such kind of rays are called diffractive rays [6].

The spatial pattern of mode C is not a special feature of

The formation of long-lived, scar-like modes near ARCs
with external coupling is not restricted to TE polarization nor
to the rectangular geometry. Figures 5(b) and (c) show ex-
amples with transverse magnetic (TM) polarization in an el-
liptical and a (semi-) stadium-shaped resonator with refrac-
tive index n = 3.3. The parameter is the excentricity and the
length of the straight line segments, respectively. For modes
in elliptical billiards see Ref. [33]. Let us mention that lo-
cal maxima of quality factors as function of a shape param-
eter had already been exploited for minimizing losses from
stadium-shaped cavities [12]. However, the case in Ref. [12]
is not related to ARCs, but is an interference effect of unstable
periodic rays [34].

In summary, we demonstrated the formation of long-lived
modes near avoided resonances crossings in optical microcav-
ities. For a number of different types of cavities (rectangular,
elliptical, and stadium-shaped) we observe strong localization
of these modes, resembling scarred states. We expect that this
ﬁnding is highly relevant for understanding the localization
properties of long-lived states not only in optical systems but
in various ﬁelds of research.

We acknowledge helpful discussions with M. Hentschel,

F. Anders T. Y. Kwon, and T. Gorin.

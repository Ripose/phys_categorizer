Complex and interesting electromagnetic behavior can be found in spaces with non-ﬂat topology.
When considering the properties of an electromagnetic medium under an arbitrary coordinate trans-
formation an alternative interpretation presents itself. The transformed material property tensors
may be interpreted as a diﬀerent set of material properties in a ﬂat, Cartesian space. We describe
the calculation of these material properties for coordinate transformations that describe spaces with
spherical or cylindrical holes in them. The resulting material properties can then implement invisi-
bility cloaks in ﬂat space. We also describe a method for performing geometric ray tracing in these
materials which are both inhomogeneous and anisotropic in their electric permittivity and magnetic
permeability.

I.

INTRODUCTION

the components are

Recently the use of coordinate transformations to pro-
duce material speciﬁcations that control electromagnetic
ﬁelds in interesting and useful ways has been discussed.
We have described such a method in which the transfor-
mation properties of Maxwell’s equations and the consti-
tutive relations can yield material descriptions that im-
plement surprising functionality, such as invisibility[1].
Another author described a similar method where the
two dimensional Helmholtz equation is transformed to
produce similar eﬀects in the geometric limit[2]. We note
that these theoretical design methods are of more than
academic interest, as the material speciﬁcations can be
implemented with metamaterial technology[3–8]. There
has also been recent work on invisibility cloaking that
does not employ the transformation method[9, 10].

In this article we describe how to calculate these ma-
terial properties directly as Cartesian tensors and to per-
form ray tracing on devices composed of these materials.
We work out two examples in detail, the spherical and
cylindrical invisibility cloak.

II. MATERIAL PROPERTIES

We will describe the transformation properties of the
electromagnetic, material property tensors. We ﬁrst note
that the Minkowski form of Maxwell’s equations[11–13]

Fαβ,µ + Fβµ,α + Fµα,β = 0
,α = J β

Gαβ

(1a)

(1b)

is form invariant for general space-time transformations.
Fαβ is the tensor of electric ﬁeld and magnetic induction,
and Gαβ is the tensor density of electric displacement and
magnetic ﬁeld, and J β is the source vecto. In SI units

(6) are the primary tools for the transformation design
method when the base medium is not bianisotropic and
the desired device moves or change shape with speeds
much less than that of light, i.e. probably all devices of
practical interest. These equations can be shown to be
exactly equivalent to the results derived by Ward and
Pendry[15].

Maxwell’s equations, (1), together with the medium
speciﬁed by (4) or (6) describe a single electromagnetic
behavior, but this behavior can be interpreted in two
ways.

One way, the traditional way, is that the material prop-
erty tensors that appear on the left and right hand sides
of (4) or (6) represent the same material properties, but
in diﬀerent spaces. The components in the transformed
space are diﬀerent form those in the original space, due
to the topology of the transformation. We will refer to
this view as the topological interpretation.

An alternative interpretation,

is that the material
property tensors on the left and right hand sides of (4)
or (6) represent diﬀerent material properties. Both sets
of tensor components are interpreted as components in a
ﬂat, Cartesian space. The form invariance of Maxwell’s
equations insures that both interpretations lead to the
same electromagnetic behavior. We will refer to this view
as the materials interpretation.

To design something of interest, one imagines a space
with some desired property, a hole for example. Then
one constructs the coordinate transformation of the space
with this desired property. Using (4) or (6) one can then
calculate a set of material properties that will implement
this interesting property of the imagined space in our own
boring, ﬂat, Cartesian space.

A. Spherical Cloak

The spherical cloak is designed by considering a spher-
ically symmetric coordinate transformation. This trans-
formation compresses all the space in a volume of radius,
b, into a spherical shell of inner radius, a, and outer ra-
dius, b. Consider a position vector, x.
In the original
coordinate system (Fig.1A) it has components, xi, and
in the transformed coordinate system (Fig.1B), xi
. Of

nents is shown in (C).

Perhaps the simplest spherical cloak transformation
maps points from a radius, r, to a radius, r′, according
to the following linear function

b
which we apply over the domain, 0 ≤ r ≤ b, (or equiva-
lently, a ≤ r′ ≤ b). Outside this domain we assume an
identity transformation. (All equations in the remainder
of this article apply only to the transformation domain.)
We must always limit the transformation to apply only
over a ﬁnite region of space if we wish to implement it
with materials of ﬁnite extent. Note that when r = 0
then r′ = a, so that the origin is mapped out to a ﬁ-
nite radius, opening up a whole in space. Note also that

when r = b then r′ = b, so that space at the outer bound-
ary of the transformation is undistorted and there is no
discontinuity with the space outside the transformation
domain.

Now since our transformation is radially symmetric,
the unit vectors in materials interpretation and in the
original space must be equal.

where we have eliminated any dependence on the compo-
nents of x in the original space, xi, or the magnitude, r.
We can now drop the primes for aesthetic reasons, and we
need not make the distinction between vectors and one-
forms as we consider this to be a material speciﬁcation in
ﬂat, Cartesian, three-space, where such distinctions are
not necessary. Writing this expression in direct notation

B. Cylindrical Cloak

To analyze a cylindrical cloak we will use two projec-
tion operators. One which projects onto the cylinder’s
axis, (which we will call the third coordinate or z-axis),
and one that projects onto the plane normal to the cylin-
der’s axis.

Z ij = δi
T ij = δi

We do not mean to imply that these are tensors. We de-
ﬁne these operators to perform these projections onto the
third coordinate and the plane normal to the third co-
ordinate in whatever basis (including mixed bases) they
are applied to. Thus we will refer to their components
with indices up or down, primed or un-primed, at will.
We now use the transverse projection operator to deﬁne
a transverse coordinate.

ρi = T i

jxj

(25)

The coordinate transformation for the cylindrical case is
the same as that of the spherical case in the two dimen-
sions normal to the cylinder’s axis. Along the cylinders
axis the transformation is the identity. Thus we have for
the transformation matrix.

III. HAMILTONIAN AND RAY EQUATIONS

The Hamiltonian we will use for generating the ray
paths is essentially the plane wave dispersion relation[17].
We derive it here, brieﬂy, to show our choice of di-
mensionality for the relevant variables. We begin with
Maxwell’s curl equations in SI units

∇ × E = −

∇ × H =

(32)

∂B
∂t

∂D
∂t

We assume plane wave solutions with slowly varying co-
eﬃcients, appropriate for the geometric limit

E = E0ei(k0k·x−ωt)

H =

H0ei(k0k·x−ωt)

(33)

1
η0

Here η0 =
µ0/ε0 is the impedance of free space, giv-
ing E0 and H0 the same units, and k0 = ω/c making k
dimensionless. We use constitutive relations with dimen-
sionless tensors ε and µ.

p

D = ε0εE

B = µ0µH

(34)

Plugging (33) and (34) into the curl equations (32) we
obtain

k × E0 − µH0 = 0

k × H0 + εE0 = 0

(35)

Eliminating the magnetic ﬁeld we ﬁnd

k ×

µ−1 (k × E0)
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

+ εE0 = 0

Deﬁning the operator, K[13],

Kik ≡ ǫijkkj

the dispersion relation (36) can be expressed as a single
operator on E0,

Kµ−1K + ε

(cid:1)

E0 = 0

(36)

(37)

(38)

4

(39)

det

Kµ−1K + ε
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

= 0

Now for material properties derived from transforming
free space, ε and µ are the same symmetric tensor, which
we call n.
In this case the dispersion relation has an
alternate expression

det

Kn−1K + n
(cid:1)

(cid:0)

=

1
det (n)

(knk− det (n))2

(40)

This can be proved by brute force, evaluating the two ex-
pression for a matrix, n, with arbitrary symmetric com-
ponents, or perhaps some other clever way. The latter
expression is clearly fourth order in k, but has only two
unique solutions. Thus we discover that in media with
ε = µ the ordinary ray and extraordinary ray (found in
anisotropic dielectrics) are degenerate. This can also be
seen by noting that in free space the ordinary ray and
extraordinary ray follow the same path. A coordinate
transformation cannot separate these two paths, so they
will follow the same path in the transformed coordinate
space and thus also in the equivalent media.

The Hamiltonian then easily factors into two terms
that represent degenerate modes. Further it is easy to
show ( by plugging (41) into (42) ) that the Hamiltonian
may be multiplied by an arbitrary function of the spatial
coordinates without changing the paths obtained from
the equations of motion, (only the parameterization is
changed), thus we can drop the factor, 1/ det (n), and
our Hamiltonian is

H = f (x) (knk − det (n))

(41)

where f (x) is some arbitrary function of position. The
equations of motion are[17]

dx
dτ
dk
dτ

=

∂H
∂k

= −

∂H
∂x

(42a)

(42b)

where τ parameterizes the paths. This pair of coupled,
ﬁrst order, ordinary diﬀerential equations can be inte-
grated using a standard solver, such as Mathematica’s
NDSolve.

IV. REFRACTION

The equations of motion, (42), govern the path of the
ray throughout the continuously varying inhomogenous
media. At discontinuities, such as the outer boundary of
a cloak, we must perform boundary matching to deter-
mine the discontinuous change in direction of the ray, i.e.

refraction. Given k1 on one side of the boundary we ﬁnd
k2 on the other side as follows. The transverse compo-
nent of the wave vector is conserved across the boundary.
(k1 − k2) × n = 0
(43)
where here n is the unit normal to the boundary. This
vector equation represents just two equations. The third
is obtained by requiring the wave vector to satisfy the
plane wave dispersion relation of the mode represented
by the Hamiltonian.

(44)

H (k2) = 0
These three equations determine the three unknowns of
the vector components of k2. Since H is quadratic in
k, there will be two solutions, one that carries energy
into medium 2, the desired solution, and one that carries
energy out. The path of the ray, dx/dτ , determines the
direction of energy ﬂow, so the Hamiltonian can be used
to determine which is the desired solution. The desired
solution satisﬁes

∂H
∂k

· n > 0

(45)

if n is the normal pointing into medium 2.

These equations apply equally well to refraction into
or out of transformation media. Refracting out into free
space is much easier since the Hamiltonian of free space
is just, H = k · k − 1.

V. CLOAK HAMILTONIANS

We now show speciﬁc examples of ray tracing. Below
we will choose a speciﬁc form for the Hamiltonian, plug
in the material properties and display the derivatives of
the Hamiltonian, for both the spherical and cylindrical
cloak.

these properties to perform ray tracing. Examples, of
spherical and cylindrical cloaks are worked out in some
detail. Some of the value in this eﬀort is to provide in-
dependent conﬁrmation that the material properties cal-
culated from the transformation do indeed cause electro-
magnetic waves to behave in the desired and predicted
manner. Eventually, this technique will become more ac-
cepted and independent conﬁrmation will not be needed.
One can see what the waves will do much more easily by
applying the transformation to the rays or ﬁelds in the
original space where the behavior is simpler if not trivial.
However, one may still want to perform ray tracing on
these media to see the eﬀects of perturbations from the
ideal material speciﬁcation.

We have shown how to calculate the material proper-
ties associated with a coordinate transformation and use

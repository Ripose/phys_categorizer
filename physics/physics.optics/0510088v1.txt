Abstract. We demonstrate two techniques for studying the features of three-level systems driven by two
lasers (called control and probe), when the transitions are Doppler broadened as in room-temperature
vapor. For Λ-type systems, the probe laser is split to produce a counter-propagating pump beam that
saturates the transition for the zero-velocity atoms. Probe transmission then shows Doppler-free peaks
which can even have sub-natural linewidth. For V-type systems, the transmission of the control beam
is detected as the probe laser is scanned. The signal shows Doppler-free peaks when the probe laser is
resonant with transitions for the zero-velocity group. Both techniques greatly simplify the study of three-
level systems since theoretical predictions can be directly compared without complications from Doppler
broadening and the presence of multiple hyperﬁne levels in the spectrum.

1 Introduction

There have been several recent theoretical and experi-
mental studies where control lasers have been used in
three-level systems to modify the absorption properties
of a weak probe laser [1,2,3,4]. For example, in electro-
magnetically induced transparency (EIT), an initially ab-
sorbing medium is made transparent to a probe beam
when a strong control laser is turned on [5,6]. EIT tech-
niques have several practical applications in probe am-
pliﬁcation [7], lasing without inversion [2] and suppres-
sion of spontaneous emission [8,9,10]. Experimental ob-
servations of EIT have been facilitated by the advent of
low-cost tunable diode lasers which can be used to ac-
cess transitions in alkali atoms such as Rb and Cs. Al-
kali atoms have convenient energy levels with strong os-
cillator strengths which form almost ideal three-level sys-
tems. However, spectroscopy in room-temperature vapor
of these atoms is often limited by Doppler broadening,
which is typically a factor of 100 larger than the natu-
ral linewidth. Therefore, in many experiments, large laser
intensities are needed to overcome this broadening and
observe the predicted eﬀects [4], since the scale for the
Rabi frequency of the control laser is set by the width
of the transition. Moreover, the Doppler-broadened spec-
trum contains several closely-spaced hyperﬁne levels, so
that the system is not a simple three-level system but a
multi-level system. In such situations, theoretical calcu-
lations based on the three-level model are only approxi-
mately valid.

In this paper, we demonstrate two techniques to over-
come the Doppler broadening in room-temperature vapor
and make the system a true three-level system. The ﬁrst
technique applies to Λ-type systems, where the control
and probe lasers couple diﬀerent ground levels to the same
excited level. The second technique applies to V-type sys-
tems, where the two lasers couple the same ground level
to diﬀerent excited levels. We demonstrate these tech-
niques in a room-temperature vapor of Rb atoms, with
two diode lasers tuned to diﬀerent hyperﬁne transitions in
the D2 line. We obtain Doppler-free spectra and observe
predicted features such as sub-natural linewidths for the
dressed states created by the control laser [11]. The sepa-
ration and linewidth of the states depends on control-laser
intensity as predicted from a simple model of a driven two-
level system. In addition, the creation of resonances with
sub-natural linewidth has applications in precision spec-
troscopy [12], better stabilization of lasers to atomic tran-
sitions, and attaining sub-Doppler temperatures in laser
cooling of atoms and ions [13].

2 Experimental details

The experimental set up, shown schematically in Fig. 1,
consists of a probe beam and a control beam derived
from two frequency-stabilized diode laser systems oper-
ating near the D2 line in 87Rb (5S1/2
5P3/2 transition
at 780 nm). The linewidth of the lasers after stabilization
is less than 1 MHz. The probe beam has 1/e2 diameter of
3 mm while the control beam is slightly larger with diam-
eter of 4 mm. The two beams are mixed in a beamsplitter
and co-propagate through a room-temperature vapor cell

containing Rb. The absorption through the cell is about
25%. The two beams have identical polarization and the
angle between them is about 17 mrad. For some exper-
iments, a counter-propagating pump beam is generated
from the probe laser using a beamsplitter.

The D2 line in 87Rb has two hyperﬁne levels in the
ground state (F = 1, 2) and four hyperﬁne levels in the
excited state (F ′ = 0, 1, 2, 3). Thus, as shown in Fig. 2, it
can be used as either a Λ system or a V system, depending
on which levels are coupled by the lasers. For the Λ system,
the same excited level (F ′ = 2) is coupled to two ground
levels: to the F = 1 level by the control laser and to the
F = 2 level by the probe laser. For the V system, the same
ground level (F = 2) is coupled to two excited levels: to
the F ′ = 3 level by the control laser and the F ′ = 1 (or
2) level by the probe laser. The control laser has Rabi
frequency of ΩR and detuning from resonance of ∆c. The
weak probe laser has detuning ∆. The spontaneous decay
rate from the excited levels is Γ , which is 2π
6.1 MHz
in Rb.

3 Λ-system

We ﬁrst consider the Λ system. The absorption of the
weak probe is proportional to Im(ρ13), where ρ13 is the
induced polarization on the
transition coupled

by the probe laser. From the density-matrix equations, the
steady-state value of ρ13 is given by [3]:

The two peaks are the well-known Autler-Townes doublet
appearing at the location of the two dressed states created
by the control laser [14]. Due to coherence between the
dressed states, the peaks have asymmetric linewidths for
non-zero detuning of the control laser, in such a way that
the sum of the two linewidths is equal to the unperturbed
linewidth, Γ .

The above analysis shows how three-level systems are
useful in many applications. For example, probe absorp-
tion at line center (∆ = 0) is strongly suppressed in the
presence of a resonant control laser because the dressed
states created by the control laser are shifted by the Rabi
frequency. This is the basis for EIT experiments. Similarly,
it is seen from Eq. 3 that the linewidth Γ+ of the second

(1)

dressed state can be much below the natural linewidth
when the control-laser detuning is large.

However, observing such eﬀects in room-temperature
vapor is complicated by eﬀects due to Doppler broadening.
The above expressions are valid for a stationary atom; in
room-temperature vapor they have to be averaged over
the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution of the atoms
taking into account the diﬀerent frequencies seen by each
atom in its velocity frame. The eﬀect of this averaging
is that the location of the peaks given in Eq. 2 does not
change, but the linewidth of the peaks changes to [3]:

where D is the Doppler width, which is 560 MHz for room-
temperature Rb atoms. Thus, in EIT experiments, the
Rabi frequency of the control laser has to be very large to
see signiﬁcant reduction in absorption at line center. An-
other complication due to the appearance of the Doppler
width is that the diﬀerent excited-state hyperﬁne levels,
spaced a few 100 MHz apart, all lie within the Doppler-
broadened proﬁle. Any comparison with the predictions of
the above equations is diﬃcult because the control laser
couples to several hyperﬁne levels, but with diﬀerent de-
tunings. The simple model of a two-level system driven by
the control laser is no longer valid.

We have solved this problem for the Λ system in the
following manner. A part of the probe laser is split oﬀ
and sent through the cell so that it is counter-propagating
with respect to the probe and control beams. The inten-
sity of this pump beam is chosen to be about 5 times
higher than the probe. In this conﬁguration, the zero-
velocity group of atoms preferentially absorbs from the
pump and the probe gets transmitted. This is a standard
technique used in Doppler-free saturated-absorption spec-
troscopy [15], which we have adapted to the three-level
case. Note that the pump beam is still very weak com-
pared to the control and any coherent driving from this
beam can be neglected as in the case of the probe beam
[16].

In Fig. 3a, we show the probe spectrum as the laser is
F ′ transitions. The control
scanned across all the F = 2
F ′ = 2 transition with a
laser is locked to the F = 1
detuning of ∆c =
11.5 MHz. With the control beam oﬀ,
the spectrum shows the typical Doppler-broadened pro-
ﬁle (with a linewidth of 560 MHz), and “Doppler-free”
peaks at the location of the hyperﬁne transitions due to
saturation by the pump beam. The words “Doppler-free”
are set in quotes because the linewidth of the hyperﬁne
peaks is usually larger than the natural linewidth. The
primary cause for this is power broadening from the pump
laser and a small misalignment angle between the counter-
propagating beams. Indeed, we have studied the variation
of the linewidth as a function of pump power. With near-
perfect alignment of the beams and with a magnetic shield
[17] around the cell, the linewidth extrapolated to zero
power is only 6.5 MHz, close to the natural linewidth of
6.1 MHz. This shows that collisional broadening in the va-
por cell is negligible. The eﬀect of stray magnetic ﬁelds in

Umakant D. Rapol, Vasant Natarajan: Doppler-free spectroscopy in driven three-level systems

3

the vicinity of the cell is to increase the linewidth by 15–
20%, which we have veriﬁed by measuring the linewidth
with and without the magnetic shield.

∼

The near-perfect alignment of the pump-probe beams
is possible only by mixing and separating the beams us-
ing polarizing-beamsplitter cubes. This requires the use
of orthogonal polarization for the two beams. For the ex-
periments reported here, we have not used this technique
but rather used a small angle (of
17 mrad) between the
beams. There are two reasons for this. The ﬁrst is that
we require the beams to have the same polarization. Oth-
erwise, the diﬀerent magnetic sublevels are driven diﬀer-
ently, and the analysis becomes complicated. The second
reason is that the separation of orthogonal-polarization
beams using a polarizing beamsplitter is not perfect. Any
leakage of one beam into the other makes the interpreta-
tion of the detected signal questionable. Thus, under typ-
ical conditions, the observed linewidth has three broaden-
ing mechanisms: power broadening due to the pump beam,
which increases the linewidth from 6.1 MHz to about 20
MHz; misalignment by 17 mrad, which increases it further
to 25 MHz, and residual magnetic ﬁelds, which increases it
to 30 MHz. This accounts for the linewidth of the hyper-
ﬁne peaks in Fig. 3a, but note that this is still 20 times
smaller than the Doppler width and is thus essentially
Doppler free.

As seen in the bottom trace in Fig. 3a, when the con-
trol laser is turned on, the F ′ = 2 peak splits into two as
predicted by the earlier analysis of the three-level system.
The two peaks are clearly resolved even though their sep-
aration is only of order 20 MHz. As shown in the inset, the
peaks also have asymmetric linewidths. This is because of
the non-zero detuning of the control laser (∆c =
11.5
MHz), which results in unequal linewidths from Eq. 3.

−

We have thus achieved a situation where the Doppler
broadening is virtually eliminated and the three-level as-
sumption is valid. Therefore the predictions of Eqs. 2 and
3 can be applied without worrying about the presence of
other hyperﬁne levels. To demonstrate this, we have stud-
ied the probe-absorption spectra as a function of control-
laser power and detuning. As shown in Fig. 3b, the sepa-
ration of the peaks [18] increases with power as expected
from Eq. 2. We have plotted the separation as a function
of control-laser power and not Rabi frequency since the
power is what is measured in the laboratory. The rela-
tion between the power and the Rabi frequency depends
on factors such as the intensity proﬁle across the control
beam, overlap between the beams, losses at the cell sur-
faces, absorption through the cell, and so on. It is diﬃcult
to experimentally determine these factors with any degree
of certainty, therefore we have left this factor as an overall
ﬁt parameter in obtaining the solid line in Fig. 3b. It is
important to note that this ﬁt parameter does not deter-
mine the trend in the data, and changes in its value would
cause the solid line to move up or down without changing
its shape. The best ﬁt shown in the ﬁgure is obtained with
a parameter that assumes that the control-laser power is
spread uniformly over a circle of diameter 4.6 mm, which

is reasonable given that the measured size of the Gaussian
beam is 4 mm.

The linewidth of the smaller peak also follows the trend
predicted by Eq. 3, as shown in Fig. 3c. There are no ad-
ditional ﬁt parameters to obtain the solid line except that
we have to increase the unperturbed linewidth in Eq. 3
from the natural linewidth of 6.1 MHz to 30 MHz. As
explained earlier, this is the linewidth obtained for the
hyperﬁne peak without the control laser. The two points
at low power lie slightly above the curve, possibly because
in these cases it is hard to determine the linewidth ac-
curately since the lineshape is distorted by the underly-
ing Doppler proﬁle and peak pulling by the other dressed
state. However, despite these eﬀects and the somewhat
large unperturbed linewidth, the linewidth of the smaller
peak is below the natural linewidth for small control pow-
ers. We have recently demonstrated this as a technique to
achieve sub-natural resolution in room temperature vapor
[11]. We have also combined the narrow linewidth and the
variation with detuning to make precise measurements of
hyperﬁne intervals. We have used this technique to mea-
sure a hyperﬁne interval in Rb with an accuracy of 44 kHz
[12].

4 V-system

We now turn to the V-system. The theoretical analysis
proceeds along similar lines as for the Λ-system [7]. In
room temperature vapor, the location of the two Autler-
Townes peaks is the same as before (Eq. 2). Similarly,
the linewidths of the dressed states (given by Eq. 3) are
increased by the Doppler width after thermal averaging.
In this case, we obtain Doppler-free spectra not by using
a counter-propagating pump beam but by detecting the
transmission of the control laser through the vapor cell.
F ′ = 3 transition
The control laser is locked to F = 2
while the probe laser is scanned across all the F = 2
↔
F ′ transitions. Since the control laser is locked, it is only
the zero-velocity atoms that absorb from this laser. When
the probe laser is also resonant with a transition starting
from the same zero-velocity atoms, the absorption from
the control laser is slightly reduced and the transmitted
signal shows a narrow peak. Thus, as the probe laser is
scanned, Doppler-free peaks appear in the transmission of
the control-laser at the exact locations where the probe is
absorbed.

↔

The resultant spectra are shown in Fig. 4. The experi-
mental parameters are similar to the case of the Λ system,
except that the beam sizes are reduced by a factor of 3,
and there is no counter-propagating pump beam. Under
these conditions, the probe spectrum shows the expected
Doppler broadening with some increased transmission at
line center for the F ′ = 1, 2 and 3 transitions. However,
there is no apparent signature of the dressed states created
by the control laser. By contrast, the control transmission
clearly shows the Autler-Townes doublets near the F ′ = 1
and 2 levels. It is interesting to note the increased trans-
mission of the probe laser at line centers. In the case of the
F ′ = 1 and 2 levels, the increased transmission is precisely

4

due to EIT because the location of the dressed states is
shifted away from the line center. Indeed, at higher power
(dotted line in ﬁgure), the transparency approaches 100%.
In the case of the F ′ = 3 level, both probe and control
lasers couple the same levels and the increased transmis-
sion of the probe is due to saturating eﬀects from the much
stronger control laser.

One of the disadvantages of the pump-probe technique
used for the Λ system is that the Doppler-free peaks ap-
pear on top of a broad Doppler proﬁle, as seen in Fig.
3a. However, in the V system, our technique of measuring
the control-laser transmission results in a constant back-
ground signal corresponding to absorption by the zero-
velocity atoms. The signal changes only when the zero-
velocity atoms start absorbing from the probe. Therefore,
the Doppler-free peaks appear on a ﬂat background. This
is shown in Fig. 5a, which is a waterfall plot of control
transmission spectra for diﬀerent values of control power.
The F ′ = 1 and 2 peaks split into Autler-Townes dou-
blets, with the separation of the doublets increasing with
power. At very low powers (below 0.5 mW) the splitting
is smaller than the unperturbed linewidth, and the dou-
blet peaks are not well resolved. One other feature of the
spectrum is that the doublet peaks in the F ′ = 2 level are
not of equal height. This kind of asymmetry has also been
observed in the case of Doppler-broadened doublets [4].

As in the case of the Λ system, the Doppler-free spec-
tra allow the predictions of the theoretical analysis to be
applied with conﬁdence. This is seen in Fig. 5b, where
we plot the separation of the peaks in the Autler-Townes
doublet as a function of control-laser power. The solid line
is the variation predicted by Eq. 2. As before, the relation
between the power and the Rabi frequency is left as a ﬁt
parameter. With the best ﬁt, the agreement with the ob-
served separation is quite good, indicating that the three-
level model is adequate to explain the data.

The analysis of the linewidth of the two peaks is slightly
diﬀerent from the case of the Λ system. Since the control-
laser detuning is zero, Eq. 3 predicts that the linewidth
should remain constant at Γ/2. From Fig. 5c, we see that
the measured linewidth is about 12 MHz (corresponding to
a total linewidth of 24 MHz) and shows a gradual increase
as the power is increased. If we assume an unperturbed
linewidth of 7 MHz, then it increases to 14 MHz due to
the misalignment and further to 17 MHz due to stray mag-
netic ﬁelds, which is still lower than the measured value.
We attribute the remaining linewidth to power broaden-
ing by the control laser. In the case of the Λ system, the
control laser is detuned from resonance and its inﬂuence
on the linewidth is negligible, therefore the only power
broadening comes from the pump beam.

The power-broadened linewidth varies as Γ √1 + s, where

s is the saturation parameter. However, at the control-
laser powers used in the experiment, the power-broadened
linewidth is 40 MHz, which is much larger than the ob-
served linewidth of 24 MHz. This is because the control
laser is primarily driving the atoms coherently, and power
broadening is a smaller eﬀect. To account for this reduc-
tion, we have ﬁtted the linewidth to Γ √1 + ks, with k as

a ﬁt parameter. In Fig. 5c, the solid line is obtained with a
value of k = 0.16, or 16%. The curve ﬁts the data reason-
ably well and explains why the linewidth increases with
control power. However, it is important to note that the
measured linewidth is still much smaller than the Doppler
width, as in the case of the Λ system.

5 Conclusions

We have thus demonstrated techniques to overcome Doppler
broadening when studying the properties of three-level
systems driven by two lasers. The Λ system requires the
use of a counter-propagating pump beam to saturate the
transition for the zero-velocity atoms. In the V system, the
control laser transmission is detected as the probe laser is
scanned. The transmitted signal shows Doppler-free peaks
when the probe is absorbed by the zero-velocity atoms.
In the Λ system, probe absorption is to the two dressed
states in the upper level created by the control laser. On
the other hand, in the V system, probe absorption is from
the two dressed states created in the ground state. Proba-
bly because of this diﬀerence, each technique works only in
its respective system and not in the other system. But the
techniques allow the predictions of simple theoretical mod-
els to be applied directly since there are no complications
arising from Doppler broadening or the presence of multi-
ple levels in the Doppler-broadened spectrum. We expect
these techniques to ﬁnd widespread use in the study of
driven three-level systems. We have already demonstrated
the application of these ideas for high-resolution hyperﬁne
measurements in Λ-systems [12]. In future, we plan to ap-
ply such ideas to precision spectroscopy in V-systems also.

Fig. 5.
In a), we show a waterfall plot of the transmission
of the control laser as a function of probe-laser detuning, for
diﬀerent values of control-laser power. The control laser has
zero detuning. As the control power is increased, the signal near
the F ′
= 1 and 2 levels shows the Autler-Townes doublets. In
b), we plot the separation of the peaks as a function of power.
The solid line is the variation expected from Eq. 2 in the text.
In c), we show the linewidth of one of the peaks as a function
of control power. The solid line is the increase due to power
broadening, as explained in the text.

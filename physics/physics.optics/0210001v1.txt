Abstract

Exploiting the similarities between the Helmholtz wave equation
and the Klein-Gordon equation, the former is linearized using the
Feschbach-Villars procedure used for linearizing the Klein-Gordon equa-
tion. Then the Foldy-Wouthuysen iterative diagonalization technique
is applied to obtain a Hamiltonian description for a system with vary-
ing refractive index. Besides reproducing all the traditional quasi-
paraxial terms, this method leads to additional terms, which are de-
pendent on the wavelength, in the optical Hamiltonian. This alter-
nate prescription to obtain the aberration expansion is applied to the
axially symmetric graded index ﬁber. This results in the wavelength-
dependent modiﬁcation of the paraxial behaviour and the aberration
coeﬃcients. Explicit expression for the modiﬁed coeﬃcients of the
aberration to third-order are presented. Sixth and eighth order Hamil-
tonians are derived for this system.

1 Introduction

The traditional scalar wave theory of optics (including aberrations to all
orders) is based on the beam-optical Hamiltonian derived using the Fermat’s
principle. This approach is purely geometrical and works adequately in the
scalar regime. The other approach is based on the Helmholtz equation which
is derived from the Maxwell equations; Then one makes the square-root of
the Helmholtz operator followed by an expansion of the radical [1, 2]. This
approach works to all orders and the resulting expansion is no diﬀerent from
the one obtained using the geometrical approach of the Fermat’s principle.

Another way of obtaining the aberration expansion is based on the al-
gebraic similarities between the Helmholtz equation and the Klein-Gordon
equation. Exploiting this algebraic similarity the Helmholtz equation is lin-
earized in a procedure very similar to the one due to Feschbach-Villars, for
linearizing the Klein-Gordon equation. This brings the Helmholtz equation
to a Dirac-like form and then follows the procedure of the Foldy-Wouthuysen
expansion used in the Dirac electron theory. This approach, which uses the
algebraic machinery of quantum mechanics, was developed recently [3], pro-
viding an alternative to the traditional square-root procedure. This scalar
formalism gives rise to wavelength-dependent contributions modifying the
aberration coeﬃcients. The algebraic machinery of this formalism is very
similar to the one used in the quantum theory of charged-particle beam optics,
based on the Dirac [4]-[6] and the Klein-Gordon [7] equations respectively.
The detailed account for both of these is available in [8]. A treatment of
beam optics taking into account the anomalous magnetic moment is avail-
able in [9]-[12].

General expressions for the Hamiltonians are derived without assuming
any speciﬁc form for the refractive index. These Hamiltonians are shown to
contain the extra wavelength-dependent contributions which arise very nat-
urally in our approach. We apply the general formalism to the speciﬁc exam-
ples: A. Medium with Constant Refractive Index. This example is essentially
for illustrating some of the details of the machinery used. The Feschbach-
Villars technique for linearizing the Klein-Gordon equation is summarized in
Appendix-A. The Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation technique is outlined in
Appendix-B.

The other application, B. Axially Symmetric Graded Index Medium is
used to demonstrate the power of the formalism. The traditional approaches

give six aberrations. Our formalism modiﬁes these six aberration coeﬃcients
by wavelength-dependent contributions.

−→

The traditional beam-optics is completely obtained from our approach in
the limit wavelength, –λ
0, which we call as the traditional limit of our
formalism. This is analogous to the classical limit obtained by taking ¯h
0
in the quantum prescriptions. The scheme of using the Foldy-Wouthuysen
machinery in this formalism is very similar to the one used in the quantum
theory of charged-particle beam optics [4]-[12]. There too one recovers the
0 where λ0 = ¯h/p0 is the de Broglie
classical prescriptions in the limit λ0 −→
wavelength and p0 is the design momentum of the system under study.

2 Traditional Prescriptions

Recalling, that in the traditional scalar wave theory for treating monochro-
matic quasiparaxial light beam propagating along the positive z-axis, the z-
evolution of the optical wave function ψ(r) is taken to obey the Schr¨odinger-
like equation

where the optical Hamiltonian

In beam optics the rays are
assumed to propagate almost parallel to the optic-axis, chosen to be z-

index is the order of unity. Let us further assume that the refractive in-
dex varies smoothly around the constant background value n0 without any
abrupt jumps or discontinuities. For a medium with uniform refractive index,
n(r) = n0 and the Taylor expansion of the radical is

In the above expansion one retains terms to any desired degree of accuracy
. In general the refractive index is not a constant and
in powers of
varies. The variation of the refractive index n(r), is expressed as a Taylor
(cid:17)
expansion in the spatial variables x, y with z-dependent coeﬃcients. To get
the beam optical Hamiltonian one makes the expansion of the radical as
before, and retains terms to the desired order of accuracy in
along
with all the other terms (coming from the expansion of the refractive index
n(r)) in the phase-space components up to the same order. In this expansion
procedure the problem is partitioned into paraxial behaviour + aberrations,
order-by-order.

In relativistic quantum mechanics too, one has the problem of under-
standing the behaviour in terms of nonrelativistic limit + relativistic correc-
tions, order-by-order. In the Dirac theory of the electron this is done most
conveniently through the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation.

Here, we follow a procedure similar to the one used for linearizing the
Klein-Gordon equation via the Feshbach-Villars linearizing procedure [13].
The resulting Feshbach-Villars-like form has an algebraic structure very sim-
ilar to the Dirac equation. This enables us to make an expansion using the
Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation technique well-known in the Dirac elec-
tron theory [14, 15]. The resulting expansion reproduces the above expansion
in (3) as it should. Furthermore it gives rise to a set of wavelength-dependent
contributions. The formalism presented here is an elaboration of the recent
work which provides an alternative to the traditional square-root technique
of obtaining the optical Hamiltonian [3].

Let us start with the wave-equation in the rectilinear coordinate system.

Eq. (17). In the nonrelativistic positive energy case, the upper components

Application of the Foldy-Wouthuysen-like technique to Eq. (14) involves
a series of transformations on it and after the required number of transfor-
mations, depending on the degree of accuracy, Eq. (14) is transformed into
a form in which the residual odd part can be neglected and hence the upper
and lower components (ψ+ and ψ−) are eﬀectively decoupled. In this repre-
sentation the larger component (ψ+) corresponds to the beam moving in the
+z-direction and the smaller component (ψ−) corresponds to the backward
moving component of the beam.

The details of the various transforms and the beam optical formalism
being discussed here turns out to be a simpliﬁed analog of the more general
formalism recently developed for the quantum theory of charged-particle beam
optics [4]-[12], both in the scalar and the spinor cases, respectively. A very
detailed description of these transforms and techniques is available in [8].

Now, we can compare the above Hamiltonians with the conventional
Hamiltonian given by the square-root approach [2]. The square-root ap-
proach does not give all the terms, such as the one involving the commutator
of p2
∂z (n2(r)). Our procedure of linearization and expansion in pow-
/n0 gives all the terms which one gets by the square-root expansion
ers of
of (3) and some additional terms, which are the wavelength-dependent terms.
Such, wavelength-dependent terms can in no way be obtained by any of the
conventional prescriptions, starting with the Helmholtz equation (6).

3 Applications

In the previous sections we presented an alternative to the square-root ex-
pansion and and we obtained an expansion for the beam-optical Hamilto-
nian which works to all orders. Formal expressions were obtained for the
paraxial Hamiltonian and the leading order aberrating Hamiltonian, with-
out assuming any form for the refractive index. Even at the paraxial level
the wavelength-dependent eﬀects manifest by the presence of a commutator
term, which does not vanish for a varying refractive index.

Now, we apply the formalism to speciﬁc examples. First one is the
medium with constant refractive index. This is perhaps the only problem
which can be solved exactly in a closed form expression. This is just to illus-
trate how the aberration expansion in our formalism can be summed to give
the familiar exact result.

The next example is that of the axially symmetric graded index medium.
This example enables us to demonstrate the power of the formalism, repro-
ducing the familiar results from the traditional approaches and further giving
rise to new results, dependent on the wavelength.

The beam-optical Hamiltonian is intrinsically aberrating. Even for simplest

3.2 Axially Symmetric Graded Index Medium

most generally described by the following polynomial (see, pp. 117 in [1])

Thus we see that the transfer operator and the aberration coeﬃcients are

modiﬁed by –λ-dependent contributions.

The sixth and eighth order Hamiltonians are modiﬁed by the presence
of wavelength-dependent terms. These will in turn modify the the ﬁfth and
seventh order aberrations respectively [18]-[21].

4 Concluding Remarks

We exploited the similarities between the Helmholtz equation and the Klein-
Gordon equation to obtain an alternate prescription for the aberration expan-
sion. In this prescription we followed a procedure due to Feschbach-Villars
for linearizing the Klein-Gordon equation. After casting the Helmholtz equa-
tion to this linear form, it was further possible to use the Foldy-Wouthuysen
transformation technique of the Dirac electron theory. This enabled us to
obtain the beam-optical Hamiltonian to any desired degree of accuracy. We
further get the wavelength-dependent contributions to at each order, start-
ing with the lowest-order paraxial paraxial Hamiltonian. Formal expressions

17

were obtained for the paraxial and leading order aberrating Hamiltonians,
without making any assumption on the form of the refractive index.

As an example we considered the medium with a constant refractive index.
This is perhaps the only problem which can be solved exactly, in a closed
form expression. This example was primarily for illustrating certain aspects
of the machinery we have used.

The second, and the more interesting example is that of the axially
symmetric graded index medium. For this system we derived the beam-
optical Hamiltonians to eighth order. At each order we ﬁnd the wavelength-
dependent contributions. The fourth order Hamiltonian was used to ob-
tain the six, third order aberrations coeﬃcients which get modiﬁed by the
wavelength-dependent contributions. Explicit relations for these coeﬃcients
were presented. In the limit –λ
0, the alternate prescription here, repro-
duces the very well known Lie Algebraic Formalism of Light Optics. It would
be worthwhile to look for the extra wavelength-dependent contributions ex-
perimentally.

The close analogy between geometrical optics and charged-particle has
been known for too long a time. Until recently it was possible to see this anal-
ogy only between the geometrical optics and classical prescriptions of charge-
particle optics. A quantum theory of charged-particle optics was presented
in recent years [4]-[12]. With the current development of the non-traditional
prescriptions of Helmholtz optics [3] and the matrix formulation of Maxwell
optics, using the rich algebraic machinery of quantum mechanics, it is now
possible to see a parallel of the analogy at each level. The non-traditional
prescription of the Helmholtz optics is in close analogy with the quantum
theory of charged-particles based on the Klein-Gordon equation. The matrix
formulation of Maxwell optics presented here is in close analogy with the
quantum theory of charged-particles based on the Dirac equation [22]. We
shall examine the parallel of these analogies in Appendix-D and summarize
the Hamiltonians in the various prescriptions in Table-A.

Appendix A.
The Feshbach-Villars Form of the
Klein-Gordon Equation

The method we have followed to cast the time-independent Klein-Gordon
equation into a beam optical form linear in ∂
∂z , suitable for a systematic study,
through successive approximations, using the Foldy-Wouthuysen-like trans-
formation technique borrowed from the Dirac theory, is similar to the way
the time-dependent Klein-Gordon equation is transformed (Feshbach and Vil-
lars, [13]) to the Schr¨o-dinger form, containing only ﬁrst-order time deriva-
tive, in order to study its nonrelativistic limit using the Foldy-Wouthuysen
technique (see, e.g., Bjorken and Drell, [15]).

It is clear from the above that we have just adopted the above technique
for studying the z-evolution of the Klein-Gordon wavefunction of a charged-
particle beam in an optical system comprising a static electromagnetic ﬁeld.
The additional feature of our formalism is the extra approximation of drop-
ping σz in an intermediate stage to take into account the fact that we are
interested only in the forward-propagating beam along the z-direction.

In the traditional scheme the purpose of expanding the light optics Hamil-
tonian
as the expansion
parameter is to understand the propagation of the quasiparaxial beam in
terms of a series of approximations (paraxial + nonparaxial). Similar is the
situation in the case of the charged-particle optics. Let us recall that in rela-
tivistic quantum mechanics too one has a similar problem of understanding
the relativistic wave equations as the nonrelativistic approximation plus the
relativistic correction terms in the quasirelativistic regime. For the Dirac
equation (which is ﬁrst order in time) this is done most conveniently using
the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation leading to an iterative diagonalization
technique.

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

The main framework of the formalism of optics, used here (and in the
charged-particle optics) is based on the transformation technique of the
Foldy-Wouthuysen theory which casts the Dirac equation in a form display-
ing the diﬀerent interaction terms between the Dirac particle and and an ap-
plied electromagnetic ﬁeld in a nonrelativistic and easily interpretable form
(see, [14, 23], for a general discussion of the role of the Foldy-Wouthuysen-
type transformations in particle interpretation of relativistic wave equations).
In the Foldy-Wouthuysen theory the Dirac equation is decoupled through a
canonical transformation into two two-component equations: one reduces to
the Pauli equation in the nonrelativistic limit and the other describes the
negative-energy states.

Let us describe here brieﬂy the standard Foldy-Wouthuysen theory so that
the way it has been adopted for the purposes of the above studies in optics
will be clear. Let us consider a charged-particle of rest-mass m0, charge q in

In the general case, when the electron is in a time-dependent electromag-
S) which removes the odd
netic ﬁeld it is not possible to construct an exp(i
operators from the transformed Hamiltonian completely. Therefore, one has
to be content with a nonrelativistic expansion of the transformed Hamilto-
nian in a power series in 1/m0c2 keeping through any desired order. Note
m0c, the transformation oper-
that in the nonrelativistic case, when
p is the odd

π2 showing
in the ﬁrst parenthesis result from the expansion of
the eﬀect of the relativistic mass increase. The second and third terms are
the electrostatic and magnetic dipole energies. The next two terms, taken
together (for hermiticity), contain the spin-orbit interaction. The last term,
the so-called Darwin term, is attributed to the zitterbewegung (trembling
motion) of the Dirac particle: because of the rapid coordinate ﬂuctuations
over distances of the order of the Compton wavelength (2π¯h/m0c) the particle
sees a somewhat smeared out electric potential.

Noting the above analogy, the idea of Foldy-Wouthuysen form of the Dirac
theory has been adopted to study the paraxial optics and deviations from it
by ﬁrst casting the Maxwell equations in a spinor form resembling exactly the
Dirac equation (B.1, B.2) in all respects: i.e., a multicomponent Ψ having
the upper half of its components large compared to the lower components
and the Hamiltonian having an even part (

dropping β from the ﬁnal reduced optical Hamiltonian, taking into account
the fact that we are primarily interested only in the forward-propagating

Let it be required to solve the diﬀerential equation

∂

u(t) = ˆA(t)u(t)

to get u(T ) at T > t0, given the value of u(t0); the operator ˆA can represent
any linear operation. For an inﬁnitesimal ∆t, we can write

u(t0 + ∆t) = e∆t ˆA(t0)u(t0).

Iterating this solution we have

u(t0 + 2∆t) = e∆t ˆA(t0+∆t)e∆t ˆA(t0)u(t0)
u(t0 + 3∆t) = e∆t ˆA(t0+2∆t)e∆t ˆA(t0+∆t)e∆t ˆA(t0)u(t0)

Appendix-D
Analogies between light optics and
charged-particle optics: Recent Developments

Historically, variational principles have played a fundamental role in the
evolution of mathematical models in classical physics, and many equations
can be derived by using them. Here the relevant examples are Fermat’s prin-
ciple in optics and Maupertuis’ principle in mechanics. The beginning of the
analogy between geometrical optics and mechanics is usually attributed to
Descartes (1637), but actually it can traced back to Ibn Al-Haitham Alhazen
(0965-1037) [27]. The analogy between the trajectory of material particles in
potential ﬁelds and the path of light rays in media with continuously variable
refractive index was formalized by Hamilton in 1833. The Hamiltonian anal-
ogy lead to the development of electron optics in 1920s, when Busch derived
the focusing action and a lens-like action of the axially symmetric magnetic
ﬁeld using the methodology of geometrical optics. Around the same time
Louis de Broglie associated his now famous wavelength to moving particles.
Schr¨odinger extended the analogy by passing from geometrical optics to wave
optics through his wave equation incorporating the de Broglie wavelength.
This analogy played a fundamental role in the early development of quan-
tum mechanics. The analogy, on the other hand, lead to the development
of practical electron optics and one of the early inventions was the electron
microscope by Ernst Ruska. A detailed account of Hamilton’s analogy is
available in [28]-[29].

Until very recently, it was possible to see this analogy only between the
geometrical-optic and classical prescriptions of electron optics. The reasons
being that, the quantum theories of charged-particle beam optics have been
under development only for about a decade [4]- [12] with the very expected
feature of wavelength-dependent eﬀects, which have no analogue in the tradi-
tional descriptions of light beam optics. With the current development of the
non-traditional prescriptions of Helmholtz optics [3] and the matrix formula-
tion of Maxwell optics, accompanied with wavelength-dependent eﬀects, it is
seen that the analogy between the two systems persists. The non-traditional
prescription of Helmholtz optics is in close analogy with the quantum theory

31

of charged-particle beam optics based on the Klein-Gordon equation. The
matrix formulation of Maxwell optics is in close analogy with the quantum
theory of charged-particle beam optics based on the Dirac equation. This
analogy is summarized in the table of Hamiltonians. In this short note it is
diﬃcult to present the derivation of the various Hamiltonians from the quan-
tum theory of charged-particle beam optics, which are all available in the
references. We shall brieﬂy consider an outline of the quantum prescriptions
and the non-traditional prescriptions respectively. A complete coverage to
the new ﬁeld of Quantum Aspects of Beam Physics (QABP), can be found
in the proceedings of the series of meetings under the same name [30].

D.1 Quantum Formalism of Charged-Particle Beam

Optics

The classical treatment of charged-particle beam optics has been extremely
successful in the designing and working of numerous optical devices, from
electron microscopes to very large particle accelerators. It is natural, however
to look for a prescription based on the quantum theory, since any physical
system is quantum mechanical at the fundamental level! Such a prescription
is sure to explain the grand success of the classical theories and may also help
get a deeper understanding and to lead to better designing of charged-particle
beam devices.

The starting point to obtain a quantum prescription of charged particle
beam optics is to build a theory based on the basic equations (Schr¨odinger,
Klein-Gordon, Dirac) of quantum mechanics appropriate to the situation
under study. In order to analyze the evolution of the beam parameters of
the various individual beam optical elements (quadrupoles, bending mag-
nets,
) along the optic axis of the system, the ﬁrst step is to start with
the basic time-dependent equations of quantum mechanics and then obtain
an equation of the form

where (x, y; s) constitute a curvilinear coordinate system, adapted to the

The two-step algorithm stated above gives an over-simpliﬁed picture of
the quantum formalism. There are several crucial points to be noted. The
ﬁrst-step in the algorithm of obtaining the beam-optical equation is not to
be treated as a mere transformation which eliminates t in preference to a
variable s along the optic axis. A clever set of transforms are required which
not only eliminate the variable t in preference to s but also give us the s-
dependent equation which has a close physical and mathematical analogy
with the original t-dependent equation of standard time-dependent quantum
mechanics. The imposition of this stringent requirement on the construc-
tion of the beam-optical equation ensures the execution of the second-step of
the algorithm. The beam-optical equation is such that all the required rich
machinery of quantum mechanics becomes applicable to the computation of
the transfer maps that characterize the optical system. This describes the
essential scheme of obtaining the quantum formalism. The rest is mostly
mathematical detail which is inbuilt in the powerful algebraic machinery
of the algorithm, accompanied with some reasonable assumptions and ap-
proximations dictated by the physical considerations. The nature of these
approximations can be best summarized in the optical terminology as a sys-
tematic procedure of expanding the beam optical Hamiltonian in a power
, where p0 is the design (or average) momentum of beam
series of
π⊥
particles moving predominantly along the direction of the optic axis and
is the small transverse kinetic momentum. The leading order approxima-
1, constitutes the paraxial or ideal behaviour and
tion along with
higher order terms in the expansion give rise to the nonlinear or aberrating
behaviour. It is seen that the paraxial and aberrating behaviour get modiﬁed

by the quantum contributions which are in powers of the de Broglie wave-
length (¯λ0 = ¯h/p0). The classical limit of the quantum formalism reproduces
the well known Lie algebraic formalism [31] of charged-particle beam optics.

D.2 Light Optics: Various Prescriptions

The traditional scalar wave theory of optics (including aberrations to all or-
ders) is based on the beam-optical Hamiltonian derived by using Fermat’s
principle. This approach is purely geometrical and works adequately in
the scalar regime. The other approach is based on the square-root of the
Helmholtz operator, which is derived from the Maxwell equations [31]. This
approach works to all orders and the resulting expansion is no diﬀerent from
the one obtained using the geometrical approach of Fermat’s principle. As for
the polarization: a systematic procedure for the passage from scalar to vector
wave optics to handle paraxial beam propagation problems, completely tak-
ing into account the way in which the Maxwell equations couple the spatial
variation and polarization of light waves, has been formulated by analyzing
the basic Poincar´e invariance of the system, and this procedure has been
successfully used to clarify several issues in Maxwell optics [32, 33, 34].

.
· · ·

The two-step algorithm used in the construction of the quantum theories
of charged-particle beam optics is very much applicable in light optics! But
there are some very signiﬁcant conceptual diﬀerences to be born in mind.
When going beyond Fermat’s principle the whole of optics is completely
governed by the Maxwell equations, and there are no other equations, unlike
in quantum mechanics, where there are separate equations for, spin-1/2,
spin-1,

Maxwell’s equations are linear (in time and space derivatives) but cou-
pled in the ﬁelds. The decoupling leads to the Helmholtz equation which is
quadratic in derivatives. In the speciﬁc context of beam optics, purely from
a calculational point of view, the starting equations are the Helmholtz equa-
tion governing scalar optics and for a more complete prescription one uses
the full set of Maxwell equations, leading to vector optics. In the context of
the two-step algorithm, the Helmholtz equation and the Maxwell equations
in a matrix representation can be treated as the ‘basic’ equations, analogue
of the basic equations of quantum mechanics. This works perfectly ﬁne from
a calculational point of view in the scheme of the algorithm we have.

Exploiting the similarity between the Helmholtz wave equation and the

34

Klein-Gordon equation, the former is linearized using the Feshbach-Villars
procedure used for the linearization of the Klein-Gordon equation. Then the
Foldy-Wouthuysen iterative diagonalization technique is applied to obtain
a Hamiltonian description for a system with varying refractive index. This
technique is an alternative to the conventional method of series expansion of
the radical. Besides reproducing all the traditional quasiparaxial terms, this
method leads to additional terms, which are dependent on the wavelength,
in the optical Hamiltonian. This is the non-traditional prescription of scalar
optics.

×

The Maxwell equations are cast into an exact matrix form taking into
account the spatial and temporal variations of the permittivity and perme-
ability. The derived representation using 8
8 matrices has a close algebraic
analogy with the Dirac equation, enabling the use of the rich machinery
of the Dirac electron theory. The beam optical Hamiltonian derived from
this representation reproduces the Hamiltonians obtained in the traditional
prescription along with wavelength-dependent matrix terms, which we have
named as the polarization terms [35]. These polarization terms are alge-
braically very similar to the spin terms in the Dirac electron theory and
the spin-precession terms in the beam-optical version of the Thomas-BMT
equation[9]. The matrix formulation provides a uniﬁed treatment of beam
optics and light polarization. Some well known results of light polarization
are obtained as a paraxial limit of the matrix formulation [32, 33, 34]. The
traditional beam optics is completely obtained from our approach in the limit
of small wavelength, –λ
0, which we call as the traditional limit of our for-
malisms. This is analogous to the classical limit obtained by taking ¯h
0,
in the quantum prescriptions.

From the Hamiltonians in the Table we make the following observations:
The classical/traditional Hamiltonians of particle/light optics are modiﬁed
by wavelength-dependent contributions in the quantum/non-traditional pre-
scriptions respectively. The algebraic forms of these modiﬁcations in each
row is very similar. This should not come as a big surprise. The starting
equations have one-to-one algebraic correspondence: Helmholtz
Klein-
Gordon; Matrix form of Maxwell
Dirac equation. Lastly, the de Broglie
↔
wavelength, ¯λ0, and –λ have an analogous status, and the classical/traditional
limit is obtained by taking ¯λ0 −→
0 and –λ
0 respectively. The parallel
of the analogies between the two systems is sure to provide us with more
insights.

We suggest that tunable orientational nonlinearity of nematic liquid crystals can

be employed for all-optical switching in periodic photonic structures with liquid-

crystal defects. We consider a one-dimensional periodic structure of Si layers with a

local defect created by inﬁltrating a liquid crystal into a pore, and demonstrate, by

solving numerically a system of coupled nonlinear equations for the nematic director

and the propagating electric ﬁeld, that the light-induced Freedericksz transition can

lead to a sharp switching and diode operation in the photonic devices.

I.

INTRODUCTION

During the past decade, photonic crystals (artiﬁcially fabricated one-, two- and three-

dimensional periodic dielectric materials) have attracted a great deal of interest due to

their ability to inhibit the propagation of light over special regions known as photonic band

gaps [1]. Such photonic bandgap materials are expected to revolutionize integrated optics

and micro-photonics due to an eﬃcient control of the electromagnetic radiation they provide,

in such a way as semiconductors control the behavior of the electrons [2].

In general, the transmission of light through photonic crystals depends on the geometry

and the index of refraction of the dielectric material. Tunability of the photonic bandgap

structures is a key feature required for the dynamical control of light transmission and various

realistic applications of the photonic crystal devices. One of the most attractive and practical

schemes for tuning the band gap in photonic crystals was proposed by Busch and John [3],

who suggested that coating the surface of an inverse opal structure with a liquid crystal could

be used to continuously tune the band gap, as was conﬁrmed later in experiment [4]. This

2

original concept generated a stream of interesting suggestions for tunable photonic devices

based on the use of liquid crystals inﬁltrated into the pores of a bandgap structure [5].

The main idea behind all those studies is the ability to continuously tune the bandgap

spectrum of a periodic dielectric structure using the temperature dependent refractive index

of a liquid crystal [4, 5, 6, 7], or its property to change the refractive index under the action

of an applied electric ﬁeld [8, 9, 10].

Another idea of the use of liquid crystals for tunability of photonic crystals is based

on inﬁltration of individual pores [11] and creation of liquid crystal defects [12, 13, 14],

and even defect-induced waveguide circuits [11]. In this case, the transmission properties

can be controlled, for example, by tuning resonant reﬂections associated with the Fano

resonances [15, 16] observed when the frequency of the incoming wave coincides with the

frequency of the defect mode. As a result, the defect mode becomes highly excited at the

frequency of the resonant reﬂection, and it can be tuned externally, again by an electric ﬁeld

or temperature.

However, liquid crystals by themselves demonstrate a rich variety of nonlinear phenomena

(see, for example, Refs. [17, 18, 19, 20]). Therefore, nonlinear response of liquid crystals can

be employed for all-optical control of light propagation in periodic structures and tunability

of photonic crystals.

In this paper, for the ﬁrst time to our knowledge, we analyze the

possibility of tunable all-optical switching in one-dimensional periodic structure with a liquid

crystal defect. We demonstrate that the light ﬁeld with the intensity above a certain critical

value corresponding to the optical Freedericksz transition changes the optical properties

of the liquid-crystal defect such that the nonlinear transmission of the photonic structure

allows for all-optical switching, and the similar concept can be employed for creating of a

tunable all-optical diode.

II. NONLINEAR TRANSMISSION OF A LIQUID CRYSTAL SLAB

First, we study the light transmission of a single slab of nematic liquid crystal and derive

a system of coupled nonlinear equations for the liquid-crystal director reorientation in the

presence of the propagating electric ﬁeld of a ﬁnite amplitude. The corresponding steady-

state equation for the director n can be obtained by minimizing the free energy which can

be written in the following form [17, 21]

f = fel + fopt,

fel =

fopt = −(1/16π)D · E∗,

K11(∇ · n)2 + K22(n · ∇ × n)2 + K33(n × ∇ × n)2

,

where fel is the elastic part and fopt is the optical part of the energy density. Here K11, K22

and K33 are splay, twist, and bend elastic constants, respectively, D = ˆǫE, ˆǫ is the dielec-

tric tensor, and the real electric ﬁeld is taken in the form Ereal = (1/2)[E(r) exp(−iωt) +

E∗(r) exp(iωt)].

We assume that linearly polarized light wave propagates normally to the liquid-crystal

slab with the initial homeotropic director orientation along z [see Fig. 1(a)]. Under the

action of the electric ﬁeld polarized outside the slab along x, the director can change its

direction in the (x, z) plane and, therefore, we write the vector components of the director

in the form n = {sin φ(z), 0, cos φ(z)}. Then the elastic part of the free energy density can

be written as

fel =

K11 sin2 φ + K33 cos2 φ

Taking into account that the dielectric tensor ˆǫ can be expressed in terms of the director

components, ǫij = ǫ⊥δij +ǫaninj, where ǫa = ǫ||−ǫ⊥ and ǫ||, ǫ⊥ are the liquid crystal dielectric

constants at the director parallel and perpendicular to the electric vector, we can write

Maximum angle of the director and transmission vs. the light intensity in the slab. Blue and red

curves correspond to the increasing and decreasing light intensity, respectively.

where A(φ) = (K11 sin2 φ + K33 cos2 φ), B(φ) = (K33 − K11) sin φ cos φ, and we take into

account that, as follows from Dz = 0, that the electric vector of the light ﬁeld has the
longitudinal component, Ez = −(ǫxz/ǫzz)Ex = −[ǫa sin φ cos φ/(ǫ⊥ + ǫa cos2 φ)]Ex (see also

Ref. [17]).

From the Maxwell’s equations, we obtain the equation for the electric ﬁeld Ex,

where k = 2π/(λc). Moreover, it can be shown [17, 19] that the z component of the Poynting

vector I = Sz = (c/8π)ExH ∗

y remains constant during the light scattering and, therefore, it

can be used to characterize the nonlinear transmission results.

As the boundary conditions for the coupled nonlinear equations (4) and (5), we assume

that there is an inﬁnitely rigid director anchoring at both surfaces of the slab, i.e.

φ(0) = φ(L) = 0,

and also introduce the scattering amplitudes for the optical ﬁeld

Ein exp(ikz) + Eref exp(−ikz), z ≤ 0,

Eout exp(ikz),

z ≥ L,

Ex(z) = 




where L is the thickness of the liquid-crystal slab, Ein, Eref, and Eout are the electric ﬁeld

amplitudes of incident, reﬂected, and outgoing waves, respectively.

To solve this nonlinear problem, ﬁrst we ﬁx the amplitude of the outgoing wave Eout and

ﬁnd unique values for the amplitudes of the incident, Ein, and reﬂected , Eref, waves. By

using the so-called shooting method [22], in Eq. (4) for the director we ﬁx the amplitude of

5

the outgoing wave and, assuming that φ(L) = 0 at the right boundary, ﬁnd the derivative

(dφ/dz)z=L such that after integrating we obtain a vanishing value of the director at the

left boundary, i.e. φ(0) = 0. Because Eq. (4) is a general type of the nonlinear pendulum

equation, we look for periodic solutions with the period 2L. Obviously, there exists an

inﬁnite number of such solutions and, therefore, there is an inﬁnite set of the derivatives

(dφ/dz)z=L which satisfy Eq. (4) and the condition (6). All such solutions correspond to

some extrema points of the free energy of the system. However, we are interested only

in that solution which realizes the minimum of the free energy. By analyzing our coupled

nonlinear equations in a two-dimensional phase space, we can show that the corresponding

solution lies just below the separatrix curve, and it has no node between the points z = 0

and z = L. This observation allows us to reduce signiﬁcantly the domain for our search for

the required values of the derivative (dφ/dz)z=L.

FIG. 2: Transmission of an one-dimensional periodic structure with an embedded liquid-crystal

defect. In the linear regime, the transmission is characterized by the presence of an in-gap resonant

peak due to the excitation of a defect mode. Nonlinear transmission displays bistability at the

defect-mode frequency with two diﬀerent thresholds for ”up” and ”down” directions and a hysteresis

loop (see the insert).

The obtained solutions can be characterized by the maximum angle φmax of the director

deviation which, as is intuitively clear, should be reached near or at the middle of the slab.

In Fig. 1(b,c), we plot the maximum angle φmax and the transmission coeﬃcient of the liquid-
crystal slab, deﬁned as T = |Eout|2/|Ein|2, vs. the light intensity. For numerical calculations,
we use the parameters K11 = 4.5 × 10−7 dyn, K33 = 9.5 × 10−7 dyn, ǫa = 0.896, ǫ⊥ = 2.45,

L = 200nm, and λ = 1.5µm, that correspond to the PAA liquid crystal [23]; because of a

6

lack of the corresponding data at the wavelength λ = 1.5µm, the values of the dielectric

constant are taken from the optical range.

From the results presented in Fig. 1(b,c), we observe sharp jumps of the director maximum

angle φmax and the transmission coeﬃcient T due to the optical Freedericksz transition in

the liquid-crystal defect. However, a variation of the transmission coeﬃcient during this

process is not larger than 15%. The threshold of the optical Freedericksz transition appears

to be diﬀerent for the increasing and decreasing intensity of the incoming light, so that this

nonlinear system is bistable, and it displays a hysteresis behavior. The bistable transmission

of the liquid-crystal slab is similar to that predicted for the slab of PAA liquid crystal in

the geometric optics approximation [19], and such a behavior is explained by the existence

of the metastable state which the system occupies at the decreasing light intensity [17, 19].

III. LIQUID-CRYSTAL DEFECT IN A PERIODIC PHOTONIC STRUCTURE

Now, we study the similar problem for a liquid-crystal defect inﬁltrated into a pore of

the periodic structure created by Si layers with the refractive index n = 3.4. For simplicity,

we consider a one-dimensional structure with the period a = 400nm and the layer thickness

d1 = 200nm, that possesses a frequency gap between 1.4µm and 2.5µm. We assume that one

of the holes is inﬁltrated with a PAA nematic liquid crystal with ǫ⊥ = 2.45. Such a defect

modiﬁes the linear transmission of the periodic structure by creating a sharp defect-mode

peak at the wavelength λd ≈ 1.5µm, as shown in Fig. 2.

To solve the nonlinear transmission problem, we employ the transfer matrix approach [24]

implementing it for the solution of the full system of coupled equations (4) and (5). By

tuning the input intensity at the defect mode, we observe the same scenario as for a single

liquid-crystal slab [cf. the insert in Fig. 2 and Fig. 1(c)]. Namely, there exists a hysteresis

loop in the transmission with two diﬀerent thresholds for the increasing and decreasing

intensities. The diﬀerence is, however, in the values. Due to a small width of the defect-

mode resonance, even a small reorientation of the director leads to a sharp (up to 90%)

change in the transmission. Another signiﬁcant diﬀerence is that the threshold values are

lower by four orders of the magnitude, for a given periodic structure for which we take 10

layers from each side of the defect.

Finally, we notice that in a ﬁnite periodic structure the defect placed asymmetrically

FIG. 3: Example of a tunable all-optical diode based on the optical Freedericksz transition in a

liquid-crystal defect. Asymmetrically placed defect leads to diﬀerent threshold intensities of the

switching for the waves propagating from the right and left, respectively.

(see Fig. 3) allows to create a nonreciprocal device when the threshold intensities for the

molecular reorientation diﬀer for the light propagating from the right and left. This feature

is associated with the operation of an optical diode [25, 26]. As can be seen in Fig. 3, by

shifting the inﬁltrated liquid-crystal defect closer to one of the edges of the structure and

ﬁxing the total length of the structure, we can increase the switching power and extend the

diode operation region decreasing the transmission power. Moreover, these results show that

the threshold intensities depend strongly on the number of periods to the structure edge,

due to a stronger conﬁnement of the defect mode. Also, this gives us a possibility to reduce

signiﬁcantly the switching power simply by taken larger number of periods in the photonic

structure.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have demonstrated that the orientational nonlinearity of nematic liquid crystals can

be employed to achieve tunable all-optical switching and diode operation in periodic photonic

structures with inﬁltrated liquid-crystal defects. For the ﬁrst time to our knowledge, we have

solved a coupled system of nonlinear equations for the nematic director and the propagating

electric ﬁeld for the model of a one-dimensional periodic structure created by Si layers with a

single (symmetric or asymmetric) pore inﬁltrated by a liquid crystal. We have demonstrated

that the threshold of the optical Freedericksz transition in the liquid-crystal defect is reduced

8

dramatically due to multiple reﬂections in the periodic structure, so that such a defect may

allow a tunable switching and diode operation in the photonic structure.

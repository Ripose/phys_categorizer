It is demonstrated that RF current modulation of a frequency stabilized injection-locked diode
laser allows the stabilization of an optical cavity to adjustable lengths, by variation of the RF
frequency. This transfer cavity may be used to stabilize another laser at an arbitrary wavelength,
in the absence of atomic or molecular transitions suitable for stabilization. Implementation involves
equipment and techniques commonly used in laser cooling and trapping laboratories, and does not
require electro- or acousto-optic modulators. With this technique we stabilize a transfer cavity using
a RF current-modulated diode laser which is injection locked to a 780 nm reference diode laser. The
reference laser is stabilized using polarization spectroscopy in a Rb cell. A Ti:sapphire ring laser at
960 nm is locked to this transfer cavity and may be precisely scanned by varying the RF modulation
frequency. We demonstrate the suitability of this system for the excitation of laser cooled Rb atoms
to Rydberg states.

INTRODUCTION

It is often necessary to stabilize lasers at frequencies
where direct locking to an atomic or molecular reference
line is not possible. Several methods are commonly used
for this purpose. One is to stabilize the target laser by
comparison with a second laser (reference laser), which is
stabilized to an absolute frequency reference such as an
atomic or a molecular absorption line. If the frequency
of the reference laser is suﬃciently close to the frequency
of the target laser, the two lasers may be heterodyned
on a photodetector and the resulting beat note can be
used to stabilize the target laser.1 However, this is only
practical up to a certain frequency diﬀerence due to the
bandwidth of the photodetector.

An alternative technique is to use an optical cavity to
“transfer” the stability from a stabilized reference laser to
the target laser.2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 One way this may be accom-
plished is by repetitively scanning the length of a “trans-
fer cavity” (TC) with piezoelectric transducers (PZTs).
The transmission fringe positions of the target laser are
then compared to the reference laser using specialized
digital circuitry2 or computers.3,4 This comparison is
used to derive an error signal which may be fed back to
the target laser for stabilization. Using this technique,
Zhao et al.3 have demonstrated a long-term frequency
drift on the order of 1 MHz. However, the scanning rate
of the cavity puts a limit on the maximum rate of error
correction. We have also found that this approach is sen-
sitive to low frequency vibrations. The complexity of the
fringe comparison is an additional drawback.

Scanning the cavity length may be avoided by making
the transmission maxima of both the reference laser and
the target laser coincide at the same cavity length.5,6,7,8,9
In this case, the cavity is locked to the reference laser
and the target laser is locked to the cavity using ana-
log circuitry. To make the fringes coincide it is possible
to frequency shift either the reference or the target laser

using an electro-optic modulator (EOM)5 or an acousto-
optic modulator (AOM).7,9 In this way, frequency stabil-
ity and precise RF frequency tunability can be obtained.
Since, in general, frequency shifts on the order of the free
spectral range of the cavity may be required, the mod-
ulator in these systems should be capable of producing
a broad-band of frequency shifts in order to avoid an in-
conveniently long transfer cavity.

In this paper, we present a technique for obtaining
these frequency shifts that is inherently broadband and
relatively easy to implement without using AOMs or
EOMs. A Fabry–Perot TC is stabilized using a tunable
sideband from a current-modulated diode laser. The car-
rier of this slave laser is injection locked to a second diode
laser (master laser)10 that is stabilized using an atomic
reference. By adjusting the RF frequency of the current
modulation of the injection locked slave laser, the TC
may be tuned to the desired length for stabilization.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The stabilization scheme has been developed for
a 960 nm commercial ring Ti:sapphire laser (Coherent
MBR-110). This laser is frequency doubled in an exter-
nal ring resonator (Coherent MBD-200) to produce ap-
proximately 70 mW at ≈ 480 nm, and used with 780 nm
lasers to excite cold Rb atoms to Rydberg states.11 Since
frequency stabilized 780 nm lasers are required in our ex-
periment to laser cool Rb atoms, they are convenient
references for transfer cavity stabilization.

The locking procedure is as follows: The 960 nm laser
is tuned by hand to the desired frequency. The mas-
ter (reference) 780 nm laser is locked using polarization
spectroscopy.12 With the TC in scanning mode, injection
locked operation of the slave laser is veriﬁed. RF current
modulation is then applied to the slave laser, which pro-
duces two signiﬁcant sidebands at ±fm , the modulation

frequency.10 The RF modulation frequency is chosen so
that a transmission peak of a 780 nm sideband coincides
with a 960 nm transmission peak. Cavity ramping is then
stopped and the cavity is locked to the 780 nm sideband
transmission peak and the 960 nm laser is locked to its
own transmission peak. The lock point of the 960 nm
may be varied by changing the frequency of the slave
laser current modulation, fm.

Figure 1 illustrates the experimental setup. The refer-
ence laser is an external cavity, grating stabilized, diode
laser (Toptica, DL100) operating at 780 nm with a max-
imum output power of ≈ 150 mW and short term fre-
quency stability of ≈ 1 MHz. The laser can be coarsely
tuned by manually adjusting the grating angle, and ﬁne-
tuning is obtained using a PZT. A small fraction (10%)
of the linearly polarized laser beam from this laser is
diverted and divided into two beams. One is used for
Rb saturation absorption spectroscopy (SAS),13 which
serves as a frequency identiﬁer, and the other beam is
directed to a Rb polarization spectroscopy setup for fre-
quency locking.12 The rest of the reference laser output
beam is coupled into a single mode ﬁber and the colli-
mated output beam from this ﬁber is used to injection
lock the slave laser.

The slave laser is a commercial 780 nm diode laser
(Sanyo, DL7140-201S) in a temperature stabilized mount
(Thorlabs, TCLDM9). Current modulation is applied us-
ing a bias-T, driven by a RF synthesizer (typically oper-
ated at 100-400 MHz, 18 dBm). The slave laser is coupled
into a single mode ﬁber [path (b) in Fig. 1]. The out-
put beam from the ﬁber is passed through a half wave
plate and a polarizing beam splitter (PBS) to obtain a
well-deﬁned polarization. This beam is then fed into the
TC, which may be temporarily operated as a scanning

2

Fabry-Perot interferometer. A small fraction of the mas-
ter laser beam is also fed into the TC for verifying the
injection locking [path(a) in Fig. 1].

Why not simply current-modulate the reference laser
directly14 and lock the cavity to one of the resulting
sidebands? Although this will work in principle, there
are a number of reasons to prefer the use of a current-
modulated slave laser, despite the additional complexity.
If the reference laser were directly modulated, the sta-
bility of its frequency lock would be compromised, par-
ticularly if the modulation frequency fm were varied. In
addition, by leaving the stabilized laser unmodulated, we
can use part of its beam for other purposes. For exam-
ple, in our experiment it is also used as a reference for
beat-note locking1,15 the diode laser systems used for a
magneto-optical trap.

The TC is of the confocal Fabry-Perot type, consisting
of two mirrors with radii of curvature R = 9.18 cm, sep-
arated by L ≈ R with a free spectral range of 817 MHz.
It is desirable to have good ﬁnesse, thus good reﬂectivity
at both 780 nm and 960 nm.
It was possible to choose
a standard dielectric mirror coating which exhibits high
reﬂectivity at these two wavelengths (Newport, BD2). A
PZT is mounted on one of the end mirrors. The typical
ﬁnesse of the TC is 100 and is limited by beam alignment
and diﬃculty in obtaining the exact confocal condition.
A small fraction of the Ti:sapphire target laser beam
is coupled into a single mode ﬁber. On emerging from
the ﬁber, the light is passed through a PBS to ensure
the beam is linearly polarized, and then aligned into the
TC. After the orthogonally polarized 780 nm and 960 nm
laser beams emerge from the TC, they are separated by
a PBS and directed onto photodiodes.

The TC length is dithered slightly at 1.6 kHz using
the PZT by an amplitude on the order of the cavity
linewidth. Lock-in ampliﬁers are used to demodulate
the transmission through the TC for both wavelengths.6,8
This provides a derivative-like lineshape error signal for
locking the transmission maxima. The 780 nm error sig-
nal is used in an integrator feedback loop which ad-
justs cavity length using the PZT. This stabilizes the
TC length. The 960 nm error signal is fed into an-
other integrator control loop which uses the “Ext Lock”
of the target laser control box to adjust the frequency.
This “Ext Lock” control has a relatively low bandwidth
( f3 dB ≈ 10 Hz).16 However, this laser system is pre-
stablized using a low-ﬁnesse cavity in a similar manner
to the system described in Ref. 8.

III. RESULT

The tuning accuracy and the drift behavior of the fre-
quency locked target laser is characterized using Rydberg
atom excitation in a 85Rb magneto-optical trap (MOT).
The details of this apparatus appear elsewhere.11,17

The excitation of cold 85Rb atoms to 46d Rydberg
states occurs as a two-color process with nearly resonant

3

780 nm light (5s1/2 - 5p3/2) and 480 nm light (5p3/2 -
46d). The 780 nm light is necessary for the 85Rb MOT
and is detuned 12 MHz to the red of the 5s1/2 F=3 to
5p3/2 F=4 transition. The 480 nm light is obtained by
frequency doubling the output of a 960 nm Ti:sapphire
ring laser – the target laser for our stabilization scheme.
The 780 nm cooling and trapping light remains on con-
tinuously. The 480 nm light is pulsed on for 1 µs using an
acousto-optic modulator. A pulsed electric ﬁeld is then
applied to ﬁeld-ionize any Rydberg atoms and draw the
resulting ions to a microchannel plate detector (MCP).
A boxcar integrator is used to gate on the signal. The
excitation and detection sequence repeat at 10 Hz .

When the 960 nm target laser is locked using the
scheme described in the previous section, its output fre-
quency may be scanned by varying the RF modulation
frequency fm. Figure 2 shows the resulting spectrum
in the range of the 85Rb 5p3/2 - 46d3/2 and 5p3/2 -
46d5/2 transitions. The strong 780 nm ﬁeld is responsi-
ble for the splitting of the lines into doublets. This is the
Autler-Townes eﬀect,18,19 similar to the results presented
in Ref. 20.

where λr,air and λt,air are the air wavelengths of the
reference laser and the target laser.
In our case, the
frequencies of the reference and target lasers are well-
known, but we must estimate the corresponding refrac-
tive indices to determine the air wavelengths. Equation
(1) can be tested using the observed separation of the
(β) and (δ) peaks in Fig. 2, together with the known
46d3/2 - 46d5/2 energy separation.21 As shown in Fig. 2,
the Autler-Townes splitting of 46d3/2 and 46d5/2 lines
are identical and thus we do not expect these to con-
tribute to the separation of the (β) and (δ) peaks. We
ﬁnd ∆ft/∆fm = (0.80 ± 0.015), compared to Eq. (1),
which predicts ∆ft/∆fm = 0.812.

By repetitively scanning over the spectrum shown in
Fig. 2 and recording the peak positions, we can monitor
the frequency drift of the locked target laser. The posi-
tions of the (α) and (γ) peaks are less dependent on the
frequency ﬂuctuations of the 780 nm cooling laser than
the (β) and (δ) peaks. Therefore, the stronger (γ) line is
used to quantify the stability of the target laser. With
the locking system activated, the control voltage applied
to the Ti:sapphire laser varies as time progresses. Since
the approximate relationship between a change in the
control voltage and the corresponding change in the out-
put frequency is known, we can use this to estimate the
frequency drift that would have occurred if the laser were
not stabilized. Figure 3 is a comparison between (a) the
estimated unlocked and (b) the locked frequency drifts
over ≈ 1 hr. There is a dramatic reduction in the long-
term frequency drift when the laser is locked.

to 46d3/5 and 46d5/2 Rydberg state transitions obtained by
scanning the RF modulation frequency fm. The upper hori-
zontal axis is obtained from Eq. 1. The observed peaks cor-
respond to the labelled transitions shown in part (a). Autler-
Townes splitting of the transitions is observed due to the pres-
ence of 780 nm cooling laser.18,20 With the red-detuning of
the 780 nm light (for MOT operation), the (β) and (δ) peaks
may be roughly understood as corresponding to 2-photon ab-
sorption from the 5s1/2 ground state, whereas the (α) and
(γ) peaks arise from step-wise excitation through the 5p3/2
state.19

IV. PERFORMANCE LIMITATIONS

Since the TC is not evacuated, it is limited in perfor-
mance by variations in the refractive indices of air for
the target laser and the reference laser wavelengths, nt
and nr respectively. The environmental inﬂuences on the
locked target laser frequency can be approximated using:

target laser as a function of time collected at various
time over several months. From nine such data sets we
observed an average long term (≈ 1 hr) frequency drift
of −0.141 ± 0.90 MHz / hr. This is consistent with the
typical variation of environmental parameters listed in
Table I. Thus, we expect that the frequency stability of
the target laser will be improved if the TC is evacuated
to minimize the environmental eﬀects.

Ultimate long-term stability is also limited by the fre-
quency drift of the reference laser. The reference laser is
frequency stabilized using polarization spectroscopy (PS)
in a Rb vapor cell.12 To observe the drift of this laser we
have monitored the beat note between this laser and a
780 nm laser stabilized using saturated absorption spec-
troscopy with third-harmonic lock-in detection. The rel-
ative drift of these two systems was typically less than
100 kHz/hr. We have found polarization spectroscopy
locking to be a good compromise between several factors,
including long-term stability, robustness and complexity.
However, if necessary, less long-term reference laser drift
could be obtained using alternative techniques.24,25,26

It is essential to be able to vary the TC length over sev-
eral free spectral ranges. This is to ensure that the slave
laser sideband and 960 nm transmission peaks are well
removed from the carrier transmission, which is stronger
and may interfere with cavity locking to the sideband.

This requires a long-extension PZT, which limits the
bandwidth of the cavity lock and consequently the tar-
get laser lock. An improved system could use a fast short
extension PZT on one end-mirror and a slower long ex-
tension PZT on the other end-mirror. The fast PZT
would be used for dithering and fast cavity stabilization,
whereas the slow PZT would handle long-term drift.27
With these improvements it is expected that the band-
width of the error signal would be suﬃcient to directly
stabilize external cavity diode lasers for many applica-
tions.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we report a general technique for laser
frequency stabilization at arbitrary wavelengths using a
reference laser and transfer cavity. A target laser fre-
quency drift of < 1 MHz / hr has been demonstrated. The
equipment involved is commonly used in laser cooling and
trapping laboratories, and does not require special mod-
ulators and drivers. A controllable frequency source is
required, but this is the same as for electro- or acousto-
optic modulators. If precise RF scanning is not required,
the RF synthesizer could be replaced by inexpensive volt-
age controlled oscillators, as in Ref. 10.

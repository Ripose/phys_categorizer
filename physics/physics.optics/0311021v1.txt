Recent experiments on femtosecond pulses in water displayed long distance propagation analogous
to that reported in air. We verify this phenomena numerically and show that the propagation
is dynamic as opposed to self-guided. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the propagation can
be interpreted as due to dynamic nonlinear X-waves whose robustness and role in long distance
propagation is shown to follow from the interplay between nonlinearity and chromatic dispersion.

The nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (NLSE) in two or
more dimensions is ubiquitous in physics as a model for
weakly interacting nonlinear and dispersive waves, and
arises in such diverse areas as Langmuir waves in plasmas,
weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates, and opti-
cal propagation in nonlinear dielectrics [1]. The ubiquity
of the NLSE means that new solutions or paradigms that
arise in one area can extend into other areas. For exam-
ple, previous experiments have shown that femtosecond
(fs) pulses can propagate long distances though air while
maintaining an almost constant ﬂuence proﬁle [2, 3, 4].
(Here long distance means that ﬁlaments of wavelength
λ and radius r0 persist for distances much longer than
their associated Rayleigh range πr2
0/λ.) Although these
results initially suggested a self-guiding mechanism, with
self-focusing balanced by plasma defocusing, numerical
simulations revealed that the propagation is highly dy-
namic, and this led us to the paradigm of dynamic spatial
replenishment, whereby the propagating pulse collapses,
the collapse is arrested, and the process is repeated sev-
eral time as the collapse is replenished from spatially de-
localized power [5]. One would then expect analogous
phenomena in other ﬁelds, and indeed the dynamic spa-
tial replenishment model in air has analogies with the
Bose-Nova phenomenon in atomic gases [6].

Here our goal is to elucidate the physics underlying
recent observations [7] of long distance propagation of
fs pulses in water. Long distance propagation has pre-
viously been explored in glass [8] and there are clear
diﬀerences with respect to air propagation. For exam-
ple, in silica glass, and water also, normal group-velocity
dispersion (NGVD) plays a much more dominant role
in comparison to air, and this gives rise to nonlinear
pulse-splitting [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Using numerical sim-
ulations we ﬁrst verify the reported properties for long
distance propagation in water, and we then perform di-
agnostic simulations to elucidate the underlying physics.
In particular, we show that long distance propagation in
water is given a natural explanation by combining the
paradigms of nonlinear pulse-splitting and nonlinear X-
waves. Nonlinear X-waves arise from the combination of
diﬀraction, NGVD, and self-focusing, and have recently
been introduced and examined theoretically [14] and ex-
perimentally [15]. Our main conclusion is that long dis-
tance propagation in water is best understood in terms

of nonlinear X-waves.

Our model for fs pulse propagation in water is based
on the propagation equation for the spectral amplitudes
of the Bessel-beam expansion of the axially symmetric
electric ﬁeld:

This is a scalar version of the Unidirectional Pulse Prop-
agation Equation solved in the z-direction [16], and in
the paraxial approximation becomes equivalent to the
Nonlinear Envelope Equation of Brabec and Krausz [17].
We utilize a tabulated representation [18] of the com-
plex frequency-dependent water permitivity ǫ(ω).
In
Eq. (1), k stands for the transverse wavenumber of each
Bessel-beam component, and the nonlinear polarization
P (~r, t) = ∆χ(~r, t)E(~r, t) is calculated in the real-space
representation from the local nonlinear modiﬁcation of
the material susceptibility:

the second is the free-electron induced susceptibility
change χpl(ρ) = (iρe2/ǫ0meω0)/(1/τc − iω0), and the
third term represents multi-photon ionization (MPI) en-
ergy losses, with MPI coeﬃcient β(K). The evolution of
the free-electron density is described by the equation

model is parameterized by the collision time τc = 10−14s
and recombination rate a = 2 × 10−15 m3/s [19]. The
MPI rate is calculated from the formula given in [20, 21]
for Eg = 7 eV.

The simulation parameters were chosen to match the
experiment of Ref. [7] as closely as possible for an inci-
dent pulse of center wavelength λ = 527 nm. The initial
pulse amplitude within the water sample was chosen as a

≃ 50 µm diameter persists over a distance of around 2 cm.

focused Gaussian of spot size w0 = 99 µm, pulse duration
τp = 170 fs, an initial radius of curvature corresponding
to a lens of focal length f = 5 cm, and we varied the pulse
input energy between 0.5 µJ and 2.5 µJ. We note that, as
in the experiment, the choice of initial focusing and spot
size are essential for realizing long-distance propagation.
First we demonstrate that our simulations reproduce
the basic features of the experiment in Ref. [7]. Figure 1
shows the maximum ﬂuence (time-integrated intensity)
over the transverse plane versus propagation distance z
in the water cell for several input pulse energies. An el-
evated and sustained ﬂuence is taken as a sign that a
light ﬁlament has formed. Similar to the experiment, at
an input pulse energy 0.5 µJ a ﬁlament just starts to
form but is terminated by diﬀractive spreading shortly
after. At higher energies, we obtain ﬁlaments whose ﬂu-
ence ﬂuctuates with z but which persist over the scale of
a couple of centimeters in quantitative agreement with
the experiment. Furthermore, the transverse ﬂuence pro-
ﬁles at diﬀerent propagation distances reveal an almost

2

constant ﬁlament diameter of around ≃ 50 µm over the
two centimeter range of the ﬁlament. This is shown in
Fig. 2 where the 1/e2 diameter, obtained by approximat-
ing the spatial integral of the ﬂuence proﬁle with the on-
axis ﬂuence times πd2/8 (corresponding to a gaussian),
is shown versus propagation distance for several pulse
energies. Thus, our simulation model agrees with the ex-
periment of Ref.
[7] in which the ﬁlaments also persist
for around two centimeters and have diameters ≃ 60 µm.

The ﬂuence maxima versus propagation distance in
Fig. 1 suggest that multiple re-focusings occur. However,
in contrast to propagation in air where the collapse is
arrested dominantly by plasma defocusing [22], in water,
and also in glass [12], NGVD is a key player. To diagnose
this we have performed comparative simulations corre-
sponding to Figs. 1 and 2 but with the plasma turned oﬀ,
and the results (not shown), though clearly changed, are
very similar in terms of the predicted 2 cm length scale
for the ﬁlament and ≃ 50 µm ﬁlament diameter. This
indicates that the plasma is not essential to understand-
ing this propagation regime:
It somewhat slows down
the dynamics and results in slightly thicker ﬁlament, be-
cause it helps to arrest the collapse, but the main collapse
arresting mechanism is chromatic dispersion. It has pre-
viously been shown that a signature of collapse arrested
by NGVD is nonlinear pulse splitting in the time domain
[9, 10, 11, 12]. Figure 3 shows the results of our simula-
tions, including the plasma, for the on-axis intensity as
a function of local time for an input pulse energy 1.5 µJ
and a variety of propagation distances after the ﬁlament
ﬁrst appears. The left-hand plot shows the pulse after
the ﬁrst pulse splitting, and the split daughter pulses are
seen to move apart with distance. This ﬁgure is in keep-
ing with the usual picture of pulse splitting [9, 10, 11, 12],
and the evident asymmetries derive from inclusion of the
plasma and the fact that we capture the spatio-temporal
focusing terms to all orders and retain the full disper-
sion landscape as opposed to keeping only second-order
GVD. We remark that the daughter pulses do not un-
dergo subsequent cascade splittings [9], but rather after
the ﬁrst splitting, energy is replenished into the center of
the local time domain around τ = 0 which then grows,
and it is this replenished center pulse that is subject to
further pulse splitting. This is shown in the right-hand
plot in Fig. 3. For larger propagation distances this pro-
cess of pulse splitting, temporal replenishment of the on-
axis pulse, followed by splitting of the new center pulse,
can repeat itself several times, and this gives rise to the
multi-peaked structures in Fig. 1, and the illusion that
the ﬁlament is propagating in a self-guided manner. For
comparative purposes we have repeated these simulations
with the plasma turned oﬀ (results not shown) and we
ﬁnd that the same basic pulse splitting coupled with tem-
poral replenishment picture emerges for the pulse propa-
gation. The main diﬀerence is that the on-axis intensity
proﬁles are more symmetric, have more structure and
show evidence of shock phenomena since the smoothing
action of the plasma is absent. This tells us that the

3

propagation is dominated by an interplay between dis-
persion and nonlinearity, in which the delayed nonlinear
responses such as plasma do not play a crucial role.

Since the multiple pulse splittings are distinct from
the cascade splitting predicted for a medium exhibiting
NGVD, this begs the question as to what physics pro-
duces the temporal replenishment of the on-axis pulse?
Our proposal here for the physical mechanism that pro-
duces the temporal replenishment is that it is due to dy-
namic nonlinear X-waves, and we shall make our case be-
low. Nonlinear electromagnetic X-waves have only very
recently been introduced theoretically [14] and produced
experimentally [15] in the ﬁeld on nonlinear optics. They
are stationary (z-invariant) nonlinear solutions that re-
sult from the combination of linear diﬀraction, second-
order NGVD, and nonlinear self-focusing. These X-waves
propagate along z with unchanging intensity proﬁle, and
if one plots a space-time (local time) slice the resulting
intensity proﬁle has a central peak and arms that form
a characteristic X shape (see Fig. 1 of Ref. [14]). Like-
wise, if one calculates the space-time Fourier-transform
of a stationary X-wave it’s intensity spectrum in (k, ω)-
space, k being the magnitude of the transverse wave vec-
tor and ω the frequency, likewise has an X-structure (see
Fig. 3 of Ref.
It has been shown that the X-
shape in (k, ω)-space should follow the linear dispersion
characteristics since they determine the relation between
the propagation angle and frequency for phase-matched
oﬀ-axis conical emission [14, 23].

[14]).

For the series of simulations presented here X-shaped
textures can be discerned in the intensity proﬁles in both
the space-time and (k, ω) domains past the ﬁrst pulse
splitting. The X-wave texture appears in the space-time
domain in the region between the daughter pulses after
splitting (not shown). This texture reﬂects optical energy
that is transported from the oﬀ-axis regions and which
serves as a reservoir for the replenishment of the pulse
center as illustrated in Fig. 3. The X-wave signature for
our pulse dynamic is much more evident in (k, ω)-space.
This is shown in Fig. 4 which shows a representative ex-

ample of a contour plot of the pulse spectrum at z = 1.7
cm (fully including plasma eﬀects). The ﬁne, “interfer-
ence” structure in this ﬁgure results from the superposi-
tion of the spectra from both split daughter pulses. For
longer propagation distances, after multiple pulse split-
tings the intensity spectra show similar features but be-
come more complicated. The central X-shaped region
where spectral energy concentration occurs is clearly vis-
ible. However, one quickly realizes that the X-shape has
a slightly diﬀerent angle compared to that expected for
pure X-waves. Nevertheless, as we show next not only the
spectrum in Fig. 4 can be explained using the paradigm
of X-waves, but in the process we also gain further insight
into the role of nonlinearity in X-wave propagation.

To proceed we make use of the three-wave mixing pic-
ture we recently employed to provide a qualitative expla-
nation of supercontinuum generation in bulk media [24].
The nonlinear light-matter interaction creates a mate-
rial response reﬂected in the change in the on-axis ma-
terial susceptibility ∆χ ≈ ∆χ(t − z/vg, τslow) that prop-
agates predominantly as a z-invariant shape modulated
on a relatively slower time scale τslow, that we hereafter
neglect. This response usually exhibits multiple peaks
(roughly corresponding to multiple intensity maxima),
which propagate with slightly diﬀerent group velocities
vg. New optical frequencies are generated through the
scattering of incident ﬁelds of these “material waves”
to produce a third wave. An incident optical wave at
(ω, ~k(ω)) will predominantly scatter into the wave com-
ponent at (Ω, ~s(Ω)) that satisﬁes the phase matching con-
dition

where m⊥ is the transverse Fourier component of the ma-
terial wave. As explained in Ref. [24], this phase match-
ing condition is not strictly enforced, but nevertheless,
it is useful in identifying the loci in the spectral domain
where the new spectral components are predominantly
generated.

In the present case, despite strong white-light gener-
ation most of the spectral energy is concentrated in the
vicinity of the original carrier frequency ω0 around zero
transverse wavenumber. Therefore, we set (ω, ~k(ω)) =
(ω0, k0) for the incident optical ﬁeld in Eq. (4) together
with m⊥ = 0 to ﬁnd the loci (Ω, ~s(Ω) where the the three-
wave mixing is near phase-matched and most eﬀective.
To solve (4) we need to estimate the group velocity vg
for the strongest response peaks. We have obtained these
estimates from the raw data for the on-axis value of the
material response ∆χ(~r, t) by measuring the shift of the
response peaks for both split daughter pulse with prop-
agation distance. As a result we obtained two solutions
to Eq. (4) corresponding to the scattering on the two
strongest response peaks. The loci (Ω, ~s(Ω) where the
the three-wave mixing is most eﬀective according to the
above prescription are shown as dashed-lines in Fig. 4,
the short-dashed line represents scattering from the ma-
terial response generated by the leading daughter pulse,
while the long-dashed line is due to trailing edge daugh-
ter pulse, and the phase-matching curves clearly coin-
cide with the strong features of the spectrum. Thus, our
phase matching argument captures the central X shape
perfectly, including the curvature of its arms (due to non-
paraxial eﬀects), and it furthermore explains the occur-
rence of the low- and high-frequency “ridges” in the spec-
trum. An important point is that each half of the X is
actually generated by one daughter pulse. If we used the
group velocity vg(ω0) taken at the central wavelength

4

instead of the actual vg’s, we would obtain a single X-
shaped locus expected for “normal” X-waves. This turns
out to have the same center, and a small diﬀerence in the
angles between the arms are due to vg 6= vg(ω0). Thus,
even after multiple pulse splitting, the split-oﬀ pulses “co-
operate” and contribute to the intensity spectrum in the
same X-shaped region in the (ω, ~k) space. This is the
origin of the universality and robustness of the X-waves,
namely, irrespective of the details of the temporal dy-
namics, they tend to concentrate their spectral energy
around the locus that supports the z-invariant propagat-
ing waves. Though they may not form z-invariant light
bullets, the X-wave character therefore clearly manifests
itself in long-distance propagation in water. Finally, we
note that the above argument doesn’t depend on details
of the nonlinearity or of the linear dispersion. Thus,
dynamic X-waves should be inherent to many systems,
though whether their signature can be observed depends
on the relative magnitudes of other competing eﬀects and
initial pulse conditions.

In summary, we have provided diagnostic numerical
simulations to show that the recent experimental obser-
vations long distance propagation in water [7] may be in-
terpreted by combining the paradigms of both nonlinear
pulse splitting and dynamic X-waves that develop from
the split pulses and replenish the pulse center. Our re-
sults therefore reveals intimate connections between long
distance propagation in condensed matter and nonlinear
electromagnetic X-waves.

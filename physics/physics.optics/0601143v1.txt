ABSTRACT

An extremely fast time-harmonic ﬁnite element solver developed for the transmission analysis of photonic crystals
was applied to mask simulation problems. The applicability was proven by examining a set of typical problems
and by a benchmarking against two established methods (FDTD and a diﬀerential method) and an analytical
example. The new ﬁnite element approach was up to 100× faster than the competing approaches for moderate
target accuracies, and it was the only method which allowed to reach high target accuracies.

Keywords: Photomask simulation benchmark, photolithography, phase shift mask, FEM, FDTD

1. INTRODUCTION
The complexity of modern photolithography makes extensive simulations indispensable.1 Modern lithography
simulators include modules describing illumination, transfer of the optical ﬁeld through the mask and aberrating
optical system of the lithographic equipment, the propagation inside the photoresist, the processes leading to
the resist image and – in advanced systems – the etching processes leading to the etched image. After nearly
two decades of lithography simulation, most of the modules along the simulation chain have attained a high
degree of maturity. However, the simulation of light propagation through phase shift masks, also applied for the
stand-alone analysis of masks and mask tolerances, is still challenging in terms of both computational time and
accuracy of the results.

The computation of the print image of a whole chip remains extremely demanding although approximations,
multi-threading and even hardware accelerators are applied to reduce the runtime of simulations. Rigorous

simulations are restricted today to small areas and even those simulations suﬀer from the high computational
eﬀort. At the same time, the progress on the semiconductor roadmap forces the need of rigorous 3D simulations, in
particular also for alternating and attenuated phase masks. Experimental investigations of the polarization eﬀects
in Hyper NA immersion lithography2 support this assertion. Further, the demand to assess the process stability
by exploring several dose/defocus conditions in the process window sharpens the shortage of computational
resources.

Keeping this background in mind, we evaluated a frequency-domain ﬁnite-element method (FEM) solver for
Maxwell’s equations which has been successfully applied to a wide range of electromagnetic ﬁeld computations
In
including optical and microwave waveguide structures, surface plasmons, and nano-structured materials.
addition, the activity was motivated by a preceding, successful benchmarking3 against MPB, a widely used and
highly sophisticated plane-wave solver used for the Bloch mode analysis of photonic crystals.4

In this contribution, the new FEM solver is benchmarked against an analytical result which is fairly realistic
for lithography, and against two competing algorithms commonly applied for the simulation of ”thick” phase
masks. For the simulation of periodic mask patterns in lithography the most prominent rigorous simulation
methods include the ﬁnite-diﬀerence time domain algorithm (FDTD)5, 6 and the modal methods such as the
diﬀerential method7, 8 or the closely related rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA).9 The methods diﬀer in
the way Maxwell’s equations are numerically solved and how the boundary conditions of the interfaces to the
unbound regions above and below the mask are established. We will give a brief description of the algorithms to
give a rough idea about the relevant parameters inﬂuencing simulation speed and accuracy in the next paragraph.
A brief description of FEM will be given in Section 2.

The FDTD approach discretizes Maxwell’s equations in both time and space and solves the scattering prob-
lem by simulating the ﬁeld evolution through time until the time-harmonic steady-state solution is reached. The
interfaces to the unbound regions are formed by perfectly matched layers (PML). Space and time discretization
are interdependent (“magic steps”). Speed and accuracy of the simulation depend on the space and time dis-
cretization, the total time period and on the PML parameters. The diﬀerential method describes the propagating
ﬁelds inside the mask by a plane wave expansion. Maxwell’s equations are thus converted into a system of linear
ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODEs) relating the scattered waves at the upper and lower mask interfaces.
Speed and accuracy depend on the number of plane waves and on the resolution used for ODE integration.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the concept of the FEM solver. Section 3 presents
several proofs of applicability including 3D simulations, 2D simulations for light scattering oﬀ line masks under
conical incidence, and adaptive reﬁnement of FEM meshes. Section 4 shows benchmark results of the three
diﬀerent solvers for a mask with dense lines and spaces illuminated at normal incidence. Section 5 veriﬁes the
accuracy of the FEM solver by examining a closely related toy example oﬀering an anlytical solution.

2. FREQUENCY-DOMAIN FEM ANALYSIS FOR PHOTOMASK SIMULATIONS

This paper considers light scattering oﬀ a system which is periodic in the x− and y−directions and is enclosed
by homogeneous substrate (at zsub) and superstrate (at zsup) which are inﬁnite in the −, resp. +z−direction.
Light propagation in the investigated system is governed by Maxwell’s equations where vanishing densities of free
charges and currents are assumed. The dielectric coeﬃcient ε(~x) and the permeability µ(~x) of the considered
photomasks are periodic and complex, ε (~x) = ε (~x + ~a), µ (~x) = µ (~x + ~a). Here ~a is any elementary vector
of the periodic lattice.10 For given primitive lattice vectors ~a1 and ~a2 an elementary cell Ω ⊂ R3 is deﬁned
as Ω =
× [zsub, zsup]. A time-harmonic ansatz with frequency ω and
magnetic ﬁeld H(~x, t) = e−iωtH(~x) leads to the following equations for H(~x):

~x ∈ R2 | x = α1~a1 + α2~a2; 0 ≤ α1, α2 < 1

The DtN operator (Dirichlet-to-Neumann) is realized with the PML method.11 This is a generalized
formulation of Sommerfeld’s radiation condition; it can be realized alternatively by the Pole condition
method.12

• Periodic boundary conditions for the transverse boundaries, ∂Ω, governed by Bloch’s theorem10:

where the Bloch wavevector ~k ∈ R3 is deﬁned by the incoming plane wave H in.

H(~x) = ei~k·~xu(~x),

u(~x) = u(~x + ~a),

Similar equations are found for the electric ﬁeld E(~x, t) = e−iωtE(~x); these are treated accordingly.
The ﬁnite-element method solves Eqs. (1) – (4) in their weak form, i.e., in an integral representation. The
computational domain is discretized with triangular (2D) or tetrahedral (3D) patches. The functional spaces
are discretized using Nedelec’s edge elements, which are vectorial functions of polynomial order (typically second
order) deﬁned on the triangular or tetrahedral patches.13
In a nutshell, FEM can be explained as expand-
ing the ﬁeld corresponding to the exact solution of Equation (1) in the basis given by these elements. This
leads to a large sparse matrix equation (algebraic problem). For details on the weak formulation, the choice
of Bloch-periodic functional spaces, the FEM discretization, and our implementation of the PML method we
refer to previous works.11, 14, 15 To solve the algebraic problem on a personal computer either standard linear
algebra decomposition techniques (LU-factorization, e.g., package PARDISO16) or iterative methods17 are used,
depending on problem size. Due to the use of multi-grid algorithms, the computational time and the memory
requirements grow linearly with the number of unknowns.

From the users’s point of view, the FEM approach presented here oﬀers the following advantages:

• The expansion into localized functions (shared with any FEM and FD approach) is adequate for step index

proﬁles occuring in masks.

• The ﬂexibiltiy of triangulations (shared with any FEM approach) allows for the simulation of mask imperfec-
tions such as sloped etch proﬁles and for adaptive mesh-reﬁnement strategies leading to faster convergence.

• The frequency domain approach (shared with any PW method) is adequate for monochromatic or nearly

monochromatic illumination.

step index proﬁles.

• Edge elements provide ”built-in” dielectric boundary conditions crucial for a high precision simulation of

• The mathematical structure of the algebraic problem allows for the use of very eﬃcient numerical solvers,
i.e., numerical methods where the computational eﬀort grows linearly with the number of unknowns only.

• The FEM discretization is characterized by two parameters, the mesh width h and the thickness of the
PML layer ρ. It is mathematically proven that the FEM approach converges with a ﬁxed convergence rate
towards the exact solution of Maxwell-type problems for mesh width h → 0, and ρ → ∞.13, 18 This allows
to easily check whether the attained results can be trusted.

These advantages result not only in an increased attainable accuracy, but – via the reduced number of unknowns
– also in a signiﬁcantly reduced computational eﬀort at moderate target accuracies required for lithography
simulation. The investigated FEM solver JCMharmony includes adaptive grid reﬁnement, higher order, 3D
Nedelec elements, advanced periodic and transparent boundary conditions and ﬂexible interfaces to the drivers
and for postprocessing. Typical computation times for 3D problems are 30 seconds for problems with N ≈ 30 000
unknowns and 5 minutes for problems with N ≈ 150 000 unknowns solved on an actual standard 64 bit personal
computer (AMD Opteron). Typical computation times for 2D problems are given in Table 2.

3. FEATURES OF THE FEM SOLVER

The range of applications of the FEM approach was examined by means of several characteric tasks in mask
simulation.

3.1. Conical Incidence

Here we investigate line masks illuminated under conical indicence (i.e., oblique incidence with respect to both
mask plane and grating lines). This is crucial for the accurate simulation of oﬀ-axis source points for dipole,
quadrupole or annular illumination. Figure 1 shows the schematics the geometry of the problem. The geometrical,
material and source parameters are given in Table 1 (data set 1). The geometry does not depend on the y-
component, therefore Eqn. (1) reduces to a simpler equation where 2D diﬀerential operators act on the 3D
electric, resp. magnetic ﬁelds. Nevertheless, the problem is simulated without any approximations.

Figure 1. Schematics of the geometry of a periodic linemask: The computational domain consists of a line of width w
(at center of the line), height h and sidewall angle β, on a substrate material SiO2, surrounded by air. The geometry is
periodic in x-direction with a pitch of px and it is independent on the y-coordinate. The refractive indices of the diﬀerent
present materials are denoted by n1 (line), n2 (substrate) and n3 (air), n3 = 1.0.

The performance of the FEM solver is demonstrated by a parameter scan for varied inclination angle α of

angle α and a subsequent rotation around the z-axis by the rotation angle Θ. In this scan we ﬁx the rotation,
Θ = 20◦ and vary the inclination, α = −25 . . . 25, further parameters are given in Table 1. This yields an incident
wave vector which is scanned from ~k ≈ (−2.021, −0.736, 4.612)107/m to ~k ≈ (2.021, 0.736, 4.612)107/m. Figure 2
shows the normalized magnitude of the Fourier coeﬃcients corresponding to the zero and ﬁrst diﬀraction orders
of the scattered light ﬁeld in dependence on the angle of incidence. A typical computation time for a single
data point in this scan was 15 sec (N ≈ 3 × 104 unknowns, adaptive grid reﬁnement, computation on a personal
computer/Intel Pentium IV, 2.5 GHz), resulting in a total time of roughly 1 h for the scan with 200 data points.

3.2. Degree of Polarization of Light Transmitted through a Line Mask

We have performed a scan over diﬀerent geometrical parameters by varying the pitch and the linewidth of a
line-mask. Geometrical, material and source parameters are again given in Fig. 1 and in Table 1 (data set 2).
Since the plane of incidence is normal to the grating lines (ky = 0), TE- and TM-polarization is supported, i.e.,
the problem becomes scalar.

Figure 3 shows the degree of polarization of the zero and ﬁrst transmitted diﬀraction orders, deﬁned as
DOP = (IT E − IT M )/(IT E + IT M ) in dependence on the pitch px. The strong Wood anomalies,7
some of
which are also veriﬁed by Teuber et al.,2 are caused by the excitation of waves traveling along the mask surface.
We have constructed transparent boundary conditions for the whole range of investigated pitches, including
’regular’ regions where the transmitted diﬀraction orders correspond to plane waves with a nonzero z-component

of the wavevector and regions close to Wood’s anomalies where certain diﬀraction orders cannot propagate as
plane waves anymore. We are currently implementing an adaptive strategy for the PML implementation of the
transparent boundary conditions in order to automatically account for such eﬀects.

The average computation time for a single data point in this scan was about 3.5 sec (N ≈ 1−4×104 unknowns,
depending on geometry size, yielding a relative error of the diﬀraction intensities of less than 1%; computation
on a personal computer/Intel Pentium IV, 2.5 GHz), resulting in a total time of roughly 75 min for the scan with
1200 data points. Similar results are obtained with the solvers SOLID E and Delight (see Section 4), however,
the Wood’s anomalies are not or less accurately resolved.

3.3. Adaptive Grid Reﬁnement

By reﬁning the resolution of the geometry-triangulation the accuracy of the solution is increased. FEM-solvers use
as a standard a regular grid reﬁnement, i.e., in 3D each tetrahedron of the discretization is reﬁned to eight smaller
tetrahedra, in 2D each triangle of the discretization is reﬁned to four smaller triangles. However, FEM meshes
also allow for adaptive strategies where only certain elements of the triangulation are reﬁned. The investigated
solver JCMharmony uses a residuum-based error-estimator19 for adaptive grid reﬁnement. Obviously, adaptive
grid reﬁnement is especially useful when the sought solutions are geometrically localized, or when the geometry
exhibits sharp features, like discontinuities in the refractive index distribution.

Figure 4. Comparison adaptive vs. regular FEM grid reﬁnement. Relative error of the transmission intensity in the zero
(circles) and ﬁrst (squares) order of TM-polarized light incident onto a periodic line mask, calculated with the FEM solver
JCMharmony. Solid lines correspond to automatic adaptive reﬁnement, dotted lines correspond to regular reﬁnement.

We compare the diﬀerent reﬁnement strategies by observing the convergence of the solutions obtained for
increased grid resolution (i.e., increased number of unknowns). The setting is similar to the one in Section 3.2, the
parameters are given in Table 1 (data set 3), and the incident light is TM-polarized. Fig. 4 shows the convergence
of the relative error of the light intensity, ∆I = |IN,i − Iinf,i|/Iinf,i, in two diﬀerent diﬀraction orders for adaptive
and for regular grid reﬁnement. Here, IN,i denotes the light intensity in the ith diﬀraction order calculated from
a solution with N unknowns, Iinf,i denotes the intensity calculated on a very ﬁne grid (quasi-exact solution).
In this example, the use of the error estimator and adaptive reﬁnement yields two orders of magnitude in the
accuracy of the error for a number of unknowns of N ∼ 105.

3.4. Fully 3D Simulations

As a true 3D example, we have examined the transmission through a mask with a periodic 3D pattern as shown
in Figure 6a (“chequerboard pattern”). It is illuminated by a plane wave incident from top. The parameters
h, n1, n2, n3, and λ0 are the same as in the previous examples. The mask is discretized by a tetrahedral
mesh supporting second order Nedelec elements.13 The inital triangulation is shown in Figure 6b. After two

The graphs (c) and (d) show the (projected) vectorial solution and the corresponding intensity gray scale map on a cross
section well below the output side of the mask, (e) and (f) show intensity maps for cross sections in the middle and at
the input side of the mask, respectively (white: low intensity, black: high intensity). (See original publication for images
with higher resolution.)

reﬁnement steps, the discretization led to a linear system with 2.7 · 106 unknows. A cross section of the 3D
vectorial solution (c) and cross sections through the 3D intensity distribution (d-f) are also shown in Fig. 5. One
cleary observes the expected discontinuous behavior of the electric ﬁeld at material interfaces. For more details
on 3D FEM computations we refer to a previous work.20

4. BENCHMARK OF DIFFERENT RIGOROUS METHODS

We have performed a benchmark of the previously described FEM solver JCMharmony and two other advanced
methods, which are also commercially available: The Finite-Diﬀerence Time-Domain solver SOLID E,21 and the
solver Delight,8 which relies on a waveguide-method. In this benchmark we have investigated light propagation
through a phase mask. The geometry of the problem is outlined schematically in Figure 1. A plane electromag-
netic wave is incident onto the computational domain with a wavelength of λ, a wavevector of ~k = (0, 0, +2π/λ)
and a polarization of ~H = (0, Hy, 0), with Hy = n1/2

(TE). The geometrical and material parameters are denoted in Table 1 (data set 4).

For a quantitative assessment of the diﬀerent simulation methods we investigate the internal convergence
behavior of the simulation results, i.e., the deviation of the simulation results from the highest eﬀort result
obtained with the same method. It turnes out that in all cases the accuracy of the ﬁeld representation inside the
computational domain dominates the convergence speed. For FDTD both space and time resolution are aﬀected
since the stability of the method requires aligning time resolution with spatial resolution. For the diﬀerential
method, the spatial resolution is determined by the number of Fourier coeﬃcients – since the grating considered
here exhibits discontinuities in the material distribution, evanescent waves play an important role for correctly
approximating the ﬁelds in the mask. For the FEM solver, the accuracy of the solution depends on the number
of unknowns which is given by the number of geometrical patches (triangles in 2D) and by the parameters
of the polynomial functions deﬁned on the ﬁnite elements. The focus of the benchmarking is to compare the
convergence speed rather than absolute runtime, i.e., the accuracy gain obtained by an increase in runtime.

Table 2. Computation times, real and imaginary parts and magnitudes of the 0th Fourier coeﬃcients Ay(~kF C = 0) for
polarizations TE and TM and for the three benchmarked methods. Geometrical and material parameters are denoted in
Table 1 (data set 4). For each method, increased computation time corresponds to a higher spatial resolution. Please
note that with Delight, both, TE and TM modes are computed simultaneously, JCMharmony was used with regular and
with adaptive grid reﬁnement. Units of the Fourier coeﬃcients are [V/m] (TE), resp. [A/m] (TM).

Therefore, other settings of the simulators were conservatively chosen in order to avoid any inﬂuence on the
accuracy. This means, we expect that a more aggressive tuning of these parameters or implementations might
slightly reduce the absolute runtime for all methods.

As output we monitor the coeﬃcients of the Fourier decomposition of the solution at the output boundary of
the computational domain. The square of the Fourier coeﬃcients is proportional to the power of light diﬀracted
into the corresponding diﬀraction order of the periodic mask.

The Fourier coeﬃcient of the y-component of the investigated ﬁeld ~f = ~E, resp. ~H is deﬁned as

Ay(~kF C ) =

fy(x, y, z0) exp(−i~kF C~x)dx ,

where ~kF C is the projection of the wavevector of the investigated diﬀraction order onto the x−y−plane (~kF C =
0 for zero order and perpendicular incidence). Table 2 lists the Fourier coeﬃcients for TE and TM polarization,
obtained from the solutions of the the three benchmarked solvers with diﬀerent resolutions. JCMharmony has
been used in adaptive and in regular grid reﬁnement mode (see Section 3.3). To ease the use of Table 2, we have
marked the already converged digits in bold.

Figure 6. Relative error (∆A0) of the 0th complex Fourier coeﬃcient vs. normalized computation time for TM-polarization
(a) and TE-polarization (b). Circles correspond to results obtained with JCMharmony (with adaptive (a), resp. regular
(b) grid reﬁnement mode), triangles to Delight and squares to SOLID E. The corresponding data is listed in Table 2.

Figure 6 shows the convergence of the diﬀerent methods. Plotted is the relative error of the 0th order complex

Fourier coeﬃcient, Ay(0), of the simulated ﬁeld components,

∆A0 =

|Ay(0) − ˜Ay(0)|
| ˜Ay(0)|

,

(6)

where ˜Ay(0) denotes the complex Fourier coeﬃcient computed at highest spatial resolution with the correspond-
ing method, vs. computation time. Since the computations were carried out on diﬀerent platforms, computation
time is given in units of a Matlab FFT run on the same platform. One unit of time corresponds to approx. 0.25 sec
on a personal computer (Intel Pentium IV, 2.5 GHz). In spite of the respective internal convergence, we observe
that the intensities of the 0th order diﬀraction computed with the three methods diﬀer signiﬁcantly (> 2%),
especially for TM polarization. For that reason, we benchmarked the FEM solver using an example providing
an analytical solution (see Section 5). The speed of convergence of the three methods diﬀers also signiﬁcantly.

It can be seen from Fig. 6 (or, alternatively, Table 1) that the convergence behavior of the benchmarked
solvers diﬀers for TE and TM polarization. In the case of TM polarization, the FEM solver JCMharmony is
the only one to reach target accuracies ∆A0 < 10−3. For a low target accuracy of ∆A0 > 10−2 computation
times are comparable for all three solvers, for a moderate target accurracy of ∆A0 ≈ 2 · 10−3 JCMharmony
is about 100× faster than Delight. SOLID E reaches an accuracy of about ∆A0 ≈ 10−2. For low resolutions
(computation time < 10 units) the loading of the code requires a signiﬁcant amount of the total computation
time (for SOLID E also the loading of the GUI which takes about 6 time units). In the case of TE polarization
the convergence behavior of Delight is better than in the TM case, being slightly faster than JCMharmony at low
target accuracies ∆A0 > 1%, comparable at intermediate target accuracies ∆A0 ≈ 1%, and about 20× slower

than JCMharmony at high target accuracies of ∆A0 ≈ 10−4. Please note that in the TM case adaptive grid
reﬁnement yields a gain in convergence for the FEM solver JCMharmony, while in the TE case it is not superior
to regular grid reﬁnement (see also Section 3.3).

5. BENCHMARKING WITH AN ANALYTICAL SOLUTION

The attainable absolute accuracy of the ﬁnite element solver was assessed using an example which is close
enough to lithography applications and allows for a fully vectorial 2D quasi-analytic solution by means of a
series expansion with proven convergence. The geometry is depicted in Fig. 7. It consists of dense lines and
spaces in an inﬁnitely thin membrane mask of perfectly conducting metal embedded in free space. The metal
layer covers the xy–plane, the strips of the grating are oriented in y-direction. The grating is illuminated from
the top by a TM polarized plane wave, i.e., Hy,in = exp(−ikzz − iωt). Geometry plus incident wave imply
the following properties: (A) Hy does not depend on the y-direction which allows us to write Hy = Hy(x, z),
Maxwell’s equations separate for the Hy-component yielding a Helmholtz equation, (B) the ﬁeld is periodic in
x with period 2L, (C) the condition Hy(x, 0) = 1 holds true inside the gap, |x| < a, whereas the condition
∂nHy(x, 0) = 0 holds true outside this gap, a < |x| < L. Altogether, the time harmonic Maxwell’s equations for
the magnetic ﬁeld component Hy reduce to

∂xxu + ∂zzu + k2Hy = 0

for (x, z) ∈ [−L, L] × R−

Hy(−L, z) = Hy(L, z)
∂nHy(x, 0) = 0
Hy(x, 0) = 1

The coeﬃcients an, bn have to be chosen such that a proper radiation condition holds true. This implies bn = 0
since we ﬁrstly require decaying solutions in case of (nπ/L)2 > k2 and z −→ −∞, and secondly, outgoing
solutions in case of (nπ/L)2 < k2 and z −→ −∞. Based on the ansatz for Hy, the derived explicit solutions for
the coeﬃcients cn in terms of coeﬃcients an, an uniform sampling, xn = −L + nL/N, n = −N, . . . , N − 1, we
obtain 2N equations for 2N unknowns an:

The numerical solution of this system supplies the quasi-analytic reference solution Hy(x, 0) with |x| ≤ L. The
reference solution was computed with N = 212 ensuring an error less than 10−6 with respect to the mean
n (Hy,N (xn) − Hy,exact(xn))2, on the interval −L ≤ y ≤ L at
quadratic error, ||Hy,N − Hy,exact|| := 1/N
z = 0. The reference solution was then compared to FEM solutions with increasing number of unknowns, where
exactly the geometry depicted in Fig. 7 was used. The convergence results are presented in Fig. 8. The ﬁrst
FEM solution was obtained for 587 unknowns yielding an error 1.506 · 10−2 , the last solution was computed
with 82 303 unknowns yielding an error 3.158 · 10−4. This proves that the FEM solver JCMharmony produces
simulation results which converge to the exact solution of the scattering problem. The current implementations
of the other solvers did not allow to examine this example with these.

6. CONCLUSIONS

We have benchmarked a FEM solver for mask simulations against two other rigorous methods (FDTD and
waveguide method). The FEM solver allowed to reach high accuracies which were not accessible with the other
methods. The computation time for phase mask simulations at moderate target accuracies was up to two orders
of magnitude lower when using the FEM solver compared to the other methods. Further we have performed a
benchmark of the FEM solver against an analytically accessible problem, and we have shown the wide range of
applications of the solver by examining several typical simulation problems.

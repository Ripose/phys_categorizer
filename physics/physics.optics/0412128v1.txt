We describe the properties of birefringent left-handed metamaterials and introduce the concept of
a birefringent perfect lens. We demonstrate that, in a sharp contrast to the conventional left-handed
perfect lens at ǫ = µ = −1, where ǫ is the dielectric constant and µ is the magnetic permeability, the
birefringent left-handed lens can focus either TE or TM polarized waves or both of them, allowing
a spatial separation of the TE and TM images. We discuss several applications of the birefringent
left-handed lenses such as the beam splitting and near-ﬁeld diagnostics at the sub-wavelength scale.

A great interest to the subwavelength imaging is ex-
plained by a number of potential applications, including
lithography and data storage, which could use the reso-
lution abilities better than the wavelength. One of the
potential candidates for improving the resolution of an
imaging system is the so-called “perfect lens” [1] based
on the concept of the left-handed metamaterials [2, 3].
The possibility of a perfect lens whose resolution is not
limited by the classical diﬀraction limit has been a sub-
ject of intense debates by the scientiﬁc community during
the past three years, and at ﬁrst met with considerable
opposition [4]. However, many diﬃculties raised by the
critics have been answered by clariﬁcation of the con-
cept and its limitations [5], by numerical simulations [6],
and in recent experiments, e.g. with a negative-index
material assembled from discrete elements arranged on a
planar circuit board [7].

The “perfect lens” is created by a slab of left-handed
metamaterial with ǫ = µ =
1, where ǫ is the dielectric
−
constant and µ is the magnetic permeability. Veselago
predicted [2] that such a material would have a negative
refractive index of n =
1, and a slab of such
√ǫµ =
a material would act as a lens refocusing all rays from
a point source on one side of the slab into a point on
the other side of the slab (see Fig. 1). Later, Pendry has
shown [1] that such a lens can reconstruct the near ﬁeld
of the source, and as a result it can create an ideal image.
Thus, a slab of the left-handed metamaterial can be
used for a sub-wavelength imaging because it ampliﬁes all
evanescent modes (near ﬁeld) inside the slab, and there-
fore allows to preserve the information about the source
structure with the resolution better than the radiation
wavelength. However, to satisfy the conditions for such
a perfect lens to operate, the distance between a source
and the slab surface, a, and the distance between the
second surface of the slab and the image point, b, should
be connected with the slab thickness d by the relation [1]
(see Fig. 1),

a + b = d.

(1)

The relation (1) means that it is impossible to create an
image at the distances larger than the slab thickness, and

this is one of the serious limitations for applicability of a

In this Letter, we introduce a concept of the birefrin-
gent non-reﬂecting left-handed metamaterials and bire-
fringent perfect lenses.
In particular, we show that,
in contrast to the conventional perfect lens condition
1, the birefringent left-handed lens can fo-
ǫ = µ =
cus either TE or TM polarized waves or both of them,
with a varying distance between the TE and TM im-
ages; and this property allows to expand dramatically
the applicability limits of the perfect lenses. In addition,
we show that such a birefringent lens is free from the
limitations imposed by the condition (1), and we also
discuss some other applications of the birefringent left-
handed metamaterials for the beam polarization splitting
and sub-wavelength beam imaging.

We consider a linear medium described by the follow-
ing tensors of dielectric permittivity ˆǫ and magnetic per-
meability ˆµ, which in the main axes of the crystal have
the form

wave impedance of this birefringent medium matches ex-
actly the impedance of vacuum, for both the polariza-
tions with any transverse wavenumbers kx, and for ar-
bitrary (including complex) values of A and B. There-
fore, the medium described by the tensors (2) is ideally
impedance-matched with vacuum being reﬂectionless [8].
Such a birefringent medium was suggested as a perfectly
matched layer in the ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain simu-
lations [9]. In a general case, when the vacuum is substi-
tuted by a medium with some ǫs and µs, the impedance
matching conditions would require some modiﬁcation of
Eq. (2), namely ˆǫ

for the TE polarized waves, where z′ = z

for real A and B Eqs. (7), (8) reproduce the ﬁeld struc-
ture of the source in the region z′ > 0 shifted from the
source position by the distance (A
1)d (for TM waves)
1)d (for TE waves). A typical ray diagram for
or (B
this case is shown in Fig. 2 for A > 1, B > 1 and A > B,
where we show the position of the source for both the po-
larizations, as well as spatially separated virtual images
= B, the virtual
created by the lens. In general, for A
images of the TE and TM sources are shifted relative to
each other. For 0 < A, B < 1, the virtual images can be
located either between the slab and the source or inside
the metamaterial slab.

More interesting cases of the medium (2) correspond to
negative values of A or/and B. When A < 0 and B > 0,
negative refraction occurs for the TM polarized waves
only, whereas the TE polarized waves refract normally,
see Fig. 3. For A > 0 and B < 0, the opposite eﬀect
occurs, i.e. negative refraction is possible for the TE po-
larized waves only. This property can be used for the
polarization-sensitive beam separation. Figure 3 shows
4
an example of this separation for the slab with A =
−
and B = +2. A two-dimensional beam propagates at the
angle of incidence 30o and is refracted. Initially, the beam
is composed of two polarizations with the same partial in-
tensities. When the beam is refracted at the surface, the
TM polarized wave undergoes negative refraction and it
becomes separated from the normally refracted TE beam.
Another speciﬁc feature of the birefringent lenses is a
possibility to form two separate perfect images for the TE
and TM polarized waves. This property follows from the
results (7) and (8). In particular, for A < 0 and B > 0,
the transverse spatial spectrum of the TM polarized ﬁeld
in the plane z′
a coincides with the spectrum

A possibility of the sub-wavelength resolution of a pair
of subwavelength sources by using the birefringent left-
handed lens has also been veriﬁed numerically, and some
examples are presented in Fig. 5 for the case of a lossy
10−8,
medium when ˆǫl = ˆǫ
where δik = 1 for i = k and it is 0 otherwise. The mixed-
polarized source consists of two beams of the width λ/5,
separated by the distance 2λ/5, where λ is the free-space
wavelength, metamaterial parameters are A =
2.5 and
B =
1.5, and the slab thickness is λ/2. A diﬀerence
in the resolution for the TE and TM polarized waves for
A
= B is explained by diﬀerent eﬀective optical thickness
of the slab for two polarizations. An increase of the losses
decreases the resolution abilities of the lens dramatically.
Figures 6(a,b) show the spatial distribution of the mag-
e (Hy(x, z)), for the TM polarization, and

spatial distribution of electric ﬁeld
e (Ey(x, z)), for the
TE polarization, respectively.

Diﬀerent examples presented above clearly demon-
strate that the birefringent left-handed metamaterials
and birefringent perfect lenses are novel objects with
many unusual properties and, more importantly, they
may demonstrate much broader spectrum of potential

whereas the TM polarized waves experience positive re-

the case of the birefringent lens additional parameters
appear, which mitigate the strict limitations for the
isotropic lens imposed by Eq. (1). As a result, the source
and the image can be located further away from the slab.
More importantly, when both A and B are negative and
A

separated by the distance

Pendry [1] and Veselago [2]. In general, the basic physics
for operating the birefringent perfect lenses is similar to
the isotropic case, and it is deﬁned by two major factors:
(i) negative refraction, and (ii) ampliﬁcation of evanes-
cent waves. Figure 1(b) shows schematically the struc-
ture of the evanescent waves in the slab for the case of

applications, in comparison with the isotropic metama-
terials and perfect lenses [1, 2]. Although the birefringent
perfect lenses are not yet realized in experiment, we be-
lieve that the ideas and results presented here are quite
realistic and will initiate strong eﬀorts in creating the
composite metamaterials with substantially birefringent
properties, including those that satisfy the speciﬁc con-
ditions for the tensor components of Eq. (2). This would
require a new thinking in applying the traditional ap-
proaches [10, 11] where the fabrication of isotropic meta-
materials was made the main target. Such an anisotropy
can be achieved by using more complicated elementary
cells made of wires and split-ring resonators, instead of
the traditional symmetric cubic lattice [11], in order to
engineer both the electric and magnetic response in three
diﬀerent directions. We also note that in order to real-
ize a birefringent lens, which is able to create an im-
age of a three-dimensional source (compared to the two-
dimensional case considered above), one should take the
metamaterial with A = B, and it can simplify the design
of the composite. Such lens creates the image of both
wave polarizations in the same plane.

In conclusion, we have introduced a novel type of bire-
fringent left-handed media which possess a number of
unique properties, including reﬂectionless scattering in-
dependent on a type of incoming monochromatic waves,
focusing and negative refraction that occur under diﬀer-
ent conditions for the TE and TM polarized waves or
simultaneously with two spatially separated TE and TM
images. We believe our results suggest novel directions
in the study of the intriguing properties of metamaterials
and their fabrications.

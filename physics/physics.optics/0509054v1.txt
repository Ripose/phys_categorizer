An extended interference pattern close to surface may result in both a transmissive or evanescent
surface ﬁelds for large area manipulation of trapped particles. The aﬃnity of diﬀering particle
sizes to a moving standing wave light pattern allows us to hold and deliver them in a bi-directional
manner and importantly demonstrate experimentally particle sorting in the sub-micron region. This
is performed without the need of ﬂuid ﬂow (static sorting). Theoretical calculations experimentally
conﬁrm that certain sizes of colloidal particles thermally hop more easily between neighboring traps.
A new generic method is also presented for particle position detection in an extended periodic light
pattern and applied to characterization of optical traps and particle behavior.

Optical trapping and guiding of micron and sub-micron
size objects have been a key topic of numerous studies in
the last three decades in the realm of mesoscale science
[1]. A recent drive in the ﬁeld is the ability to interact
with large scale ensembles of particles in two-dimensions
(2D) and ultimately in three-dimensions (3D): interfero-
metric patterns may help achieve this. Light ﬁelds at or
near total internal reﬂection may assist allowing one to
organize upwards of 1000 particles adjacent to a surface
[2, 3]. Recent work has shown the experimental demon-
stration of optical separation using an extended optical
lattice or holographic methods in the presence of a lam-
inar ﬂow [4, 5] and it has been followed by theoretical
analyses [6]. In these studies the particles are not trapped
per se but rather their diﬀering aﬃnity to a periodic light
pattern were exploited. This sensitivity is very high and
potentially oﬀers a new non-invasive method for optical
separation or sorting. Thus it would be a key advance to
show how we may separate sub-micrometer objects in the
absence of a ﬂow and potentially over a large area, facil-
itating greater throughput. The near ﬁeld optical trap-
ping has shown the ability to potentially organise parti-
cles over areas of mm2 and oﬀers a potential test area
for sorting over a large region [2, 3, 7]. Tuning the inci-
dent angle from below to above the critical angle results
in a transition between propagating and evanescent light
ﬁelds. This geometry for such optical organization[8] is
eminently suitable for sorting, even if a small part of the
incident focused beam is below the critical angle and thus
forms propagating ﬁeld. Ultimately we are creating light
ﬁeld patterning in 2D over an extended region.

In this letter we present an interferometric system that
provides conﬁnement and two-directional controllable de-
livery of particles of sub-micrometer sizes. Our system

∗Electronic address: zemanek@isibrno.cz

is employed in a geometry that both permits evanescent
wave conﬁnement as well as conﬁnement just above the
surface (by judicious choice of incident angle): this choice
of geometry in all instances allows extension of the data
presented here to a large area and concomitant higher
throughput. The key result we show is the optical sepa-
ration of sub-micrometer particles in the absence of any
imposed ﬂow by exploiting the varying aﬃnity of objects
to this spatially modulated light pattern. We are able
to separate objects based upon their size. Additionally
we demonstrate an original method for particle detection
within this periodic near ﬁeld light pattern that is ap-
plied here for quantitative study of sub-micron particle
behavior but can serve generically in any area where scat-
tering of imposed periodic light pattern by objects on a
surface can be detected (interaction of colloids, colloidal
dynamics, colloidal models of thermodynamic systems,
optical manipulation and sorting).

The interference of two counter-propagating (C-P) sur-
face ﬁelds (combination of evanescent and propagating
waves) at or near the critical angle creates standing waves
(SW) above or at the surface. As our data applies for
both these cases we generally term this eﬀect a surface
standing wave ﬁeld (SSW). In contrast to the previous
methods [9] we used a setup with two independent C-P
Gaussian beams that were focused on the top surface of
the prism. In comparison to the single beam case of the
same intensity, the interferometric optical potential well
is deeper and steeper and consequently gives stronger
longitudinal force component [10]. The end result is that
smaller particles can be conﬁned and transported rapidly
in both longitudinal directions if the SSW is moved. This
motion can be induced by altering the phase of one of
the incident waves (in our case by movable mirror), re-
sulting in a surface optical conveyor belt (OCB). This
is related to recent work in sliding SWs using radiative
ﬁelds that have been exploited for atom delivery using
Gaussian beams [11, 12] or quite recently for sub-micron

particle delivery using Bessel beams [13].

In this manner we were able to move a range of parti-
cles of sizes 350, 520, 600, 700 and 800 nm over a range
of 40 µm on the surface (Fig 1a). However we found that
beads of size 410 nm and 750 nm in contrast did NOT
follow the moving SSW and remained unaﬀected by the
imposed SSW (see Fig. 1b, 1c). Tuning the incident an-
gle may result in either a surface patterned evanescent
ﬁelds or a propagating light ﬁeld just above the surface.

FIG. 1: Proof of particle delivery in OCB but also particle
aﬃnity to OCB. a) A polystyrene sphere of diameter 520 nm is
delivered over a distance of 36 µm. b) Mixture of polystyrene
spheres of sizes 410 nm (left) and 520 nm (right). While the
bigger moves with OCB, the smaller keeps its original position
unaﬀected by OCB. c) Mixture of polystyrene particles of
diameters 350 nm and two 750 nm where the smaller one
follows the OCB motion but bigger spheres stay unaﬀected
till the moment the smaller particle approached it. But one
can notice that even before their physical contact there is
a noticeable movement of the bigger sphere caused by the
interactions between both objects.

We examine this behavior by a theoretical study based
on an optical force calculation using Lorenz-Mie scatter-
ing model [14] but modiﬁed to the C-P evanescent waves.
It does not include surface interactions for the scattered
light [15] but it is to be noted that these mainly aﬀect
the force component perpendicular to the surface which
is not the dominant consideration for the work presented
here. Figure 2 shows the theoretical depths of the optical
traps and illustrates the selectivity of the SSW to various
sizes of objects. The lighter regions indicate deep traps
where the objects can be conﬁned with smaller require-
ments on beam intensities. The dark region corresponds
to a shallow trap and in accordance with the lower beam
intensity the object stays here only shortly and due to
thermal activation hops to a neighboring trap site. An
important conclusion coming from this model is that the
sphere sizes aﬀected and unaﬀected by this phenomena
do not strongly depend on the considered incident an-
gle of the plane waves. Experimentally our observations

FIG. 2: Theoretical results showing how the longitudinal trap
depth in the SW formed by C-P near-ﬁelds depends on the
diameter of the polystyrene sphere and on the incident angle
of the plane waves (the same for both C-P waves) upon the
prism surface. The trap depth is in logarithmic scale (see the
bar for units). The contour lines show the trap depths of 33
kT , 100 kT , 333 kT , 1000 kT and 3333 kT . Polarizations of
both beams are normal to the plane of incidence, i.e. paral-
lel with prism surface, the amplitude of a single plane wave
electric ﬁeld is the same as it is in the centre of 1W Gaussian
beam focused to a beam waist 1µm ( E = 200 V m

).

concur with the above theory for monodisperse (in size)
or diluted samples on the top of the prism and we can
readily observe the diﬀering aﬃnity of the particles to the
SW pattern similar to Figs. 1b, 1c. But dense colloidal
samples suﬀered from inter-particle interactions. An ex-
ample of this can be seen in Fig. 1c when the insensitive
bigger particle started to move even before the smaller
one physically touched it. This is attributed to an opti-
cal binding type interaction [16, 17] where scattered light
from the particle selected by the OCB aﬀects the optical
forces experienced by the unaﬀected particle size.

Therefore to exploit the above described phenomena
for separation of particles according to their size we ex-
posed diluted samples to a tilted washboard potential [18]
- this was created by introducing a slight intensity asym-
metry in the two C-P beams. This asymmetry created a
diﬀerential optical gradient along the SW and if this was
moved, it resulted in the particle behavior demonstrated
in Fig. 3. The same mechanism can be used also for
3D trapping over longer distance if the OCB based on
non-diﬀracting beams is used [13].

To explore in detail the properties of SSW we de-
veloped an original method of particle detection within
this optical landscape. The basis for this method lies
in changes of the observed light pattern created by the
scattered light in the plane of CCD when the mutual con-
ﬁguration of the particle and SSW is changed (see Fig.
4). Since the SSW has a sinusoidal intensity dependence
along the propagation axis, we found parameters for a
sinusoidal dependence of intensity at each pixel of CCD
camera for diﬀerent conﬁguration of SSW and a particle.
These functions enabled reconstruction of the interfer-
ence pattern for each longitudinal position of a particle
in the SSW. Consequently as the particle moves in the
ﬁxed trap, the interference pattern is copying this motion

ticle. CCD camera provided intensity resolution in 1024
levels and the S/N ratio was always better than 100 and
therefore we do not expect serious errors coming from
weak signal detection [19].

In the subsequent experiments we tuned the beam in-
cident angle so that the transmissive ﬁeld was negligi-
ble and therefore we could assume exponential decay of
the SSW above the surface. Therefore the relative po-
sition of the object in this direction we estimated from
the ratio of total image intensities of measured and of
the best ﬁtted calculated image. To roughly calibrate
this axis we assumed that the velocity distributions in
all three dimensions must be the same since the time be-
tween subsequent measured positions is much smaller to
see a signiﬁcant eﬀect of optical potential landscape on
the particle motion. An example of the results from these
procedures is shown in Fig. 5 in the form of histograms
of 104 particle positions taken within 1.6 sec.

around the CCD but in the axis of beam propagation this
motion is linked with changes of the interference pattern
shape as described above. If we want to determine the
particle coordinates from the tracking record, we have
to ﬁnd for each frame the reconstructed pattern of the
right shape placed to the right position using transla-
tion property of Fast Fourier Transform. This procedure
gives us two information of longitudinal particle position
- with respect to the CCD (from the image shift) and
to the SSW (from the pattern shape). The later one
can be obtained with nanometer resolution regardless of
the stability of SSW with respect to the CCD. Unfortu-
nately this is not generally true for the lateral direction
which can only be found from the image shift. During
the particle tracking experiments one record from fast
CCD camera (IDT X-Stream XS3, 4 GB) consisted ﬁrst
of the SSW sweeping so fast that the particle stayed un-
inﬂuenced and secondly from the particle motion in sta-
tionary SSW. The ﬁrst part served for determination of
the functions for pattern reconstruction, the second part
was used for the particle behavior analyses. We used the
same frame rate equal to 6120 fps and integration time in
the range from 2 to 8 µs according to the size of the par-

FIG. 5: Histograms of particle (diameter 600 nm) positions.
The longitudinal trap positions (z) are clearly separated and
they are much narrower comparing to the lateral one (x). In
the direction perpendicular to the prism surface (y) the object
closer to the surface is longitudinally conﬁned much tightly.
Despite the very rough position measurements in this axis,
this conclusion is quite coherent with the expected exponen-
tial decay of the trap depth due to the dominant evanescent
ﬁeld.

We compared the trap depth in the longitudinal direc-
tion for particles of diﬀerent sizes. We assumed a Boltz-
mann distribution for each measured particle size [20] and
2
we ﬁtted a function a exp[−b sin
(z/λ + c)/(kBT )] to the
measured histograms with unknown parameters a, b, c
and ﬁxed values of wavelength λ, temperature T , and
Boltzmann constant kB. We carefully proceeded all the
experiments with diﬀerent particle sizes using exactly the
same setup within 2 hour period. Even though we can-
not measure precisely the optical intensity in the SSW,
we are convinced that the optical setup including the
optical intensity was the same for all measured particle
sizes throughout. This enabled us to compare the experi-
mental results with the theoretical model in the following
way. We calculated the trap depths for the particle sizes
used in experiments for diﬀerent incident angles of the

plane waves. The plane waves had the same intensity
and we looked for the same single multiple of this in-
tensity for all sizes that gave the best coincidence with
the experimental results. The results for two diﬀerent
arrangements are shown in Fig. 6a. In spite of the sim-

The dashed line is for setup modiﬁed with slightly smaller in-
cident angle. The vertical error bars coincided with the 95
% conﬁdential level and the horizontal ones express standard
deviation of the size of experimentally used particles. b) De-
pendence of the mean passage time τ for a polystyrene bead

on the power of the trapping laser. These values were taken
from 100 to 500 jumps and from the ﬁt of exponential func-
tion exp(−t/τ )/τ to the time t dependence of the distribution
of the measured passage times for each power. The error bars
show the conﬁdential level equal to 95% for the ﬁtted time
constants τ .

plicity of the theoretical model the coincidence with the
measurement is very good, especially with the sizes of
objects unaﬀected by SSW. Since the particle behavior

4

is controlled by stochastic processes of Brownian motion,
we measured how the mean passage time from one trap to
the neighboring trap depends on the trapping laser power
(trap depth). Assuming exponential distribution for pas-
sage time, the mean passage time also corresponds to the
period during which only 100 exp(−1)% ≃ 36.8% of the
particles stayed in the same trap. Inverse of mean pas-
sage time is for one dimensional and bistable case called
Kramers rate [21]. The results obtained for the particle
of size 520 nm are shown in Fig. 6b.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated how two counter-
propagating surface ﬁelds (combination of evanescent
and propagating ﬁelds) can be used to create surface
standing wave (SSW) where the sub-micron particles
may be sorted according to their size in the absence of
any imposed ﬂow. This system may have potential for
the organizing of biological and colloidal sub-micrometer
objects localized on the surface. We quantitatively char-
acterize the depth of the optical traps along the beams
and proved that for certain object sizes it is much deeper
and conﬁne particles for longer time than for the others.
In dense samples where particles sensitive and insensitive
to the SSW were mixed, we observed an optical interac-
tion between both types of particles once they were in
close proximity to one another. This in itself has been
employed to deliver even insensitive particles with the
help of bigger or smaller particles conﬁned in the slid-
ing SSW. This form of ”optical binding” could ﬁnd very
interesting applications in the ﬁeld of self-organizing sub-
micron objects and even living cells. The aﬃnity of the
particle size to the moving SSW was used to shows how
diluted solutions of sub-micrometer colloids can be opti-
cally sorted without ﬂuid ﬂow by exposing the particles to
a suitable optical washboard potential. Analogous calcu-
lations show that sorting may also occur due to refractive
index in this situation.

1 Introduction

Since many decades nanoporous materials, for example zeolites, play an eminently im-
portant role in the catalysis of oil reﬁning and petrochemistry. On the other hand,
molecular sieve materials began also to attract some attention as optical material in
last years. It was realized that their nanometer size pores allow to host guest molecules
giving so substance to a new class of optical material with properties which neither the
host, nor the guest alone could ever possess. In this way new pigments and luminophores
were realized as well as novel optically nonlinear and switching materials. The various
actually realized materials are reviewed in this book in chapter Nanoporous compound
materials for optical applications – Material design and properties.

A closer look at the approach of arranging molecules in an ordered framework of
pores reveals a series of aspects of fundamental interest: For example, the stereometric
restrictions which the pore framework imposes on the motional degrees of freedom of
the enclosed molecules reduces their diﬀusion to one dimensional diﬀusion in channel
pores [1]. Or, as with the concentration also the average distance between two guest
molecules is controlled, their dipolar near ﬁeld interaction can so be adjusted. In opti-
mal circumstances optical excitation energy can then be transferred nonradiatively over
distances of several micrometers [2]. That are just two examples of new phenomena in
molecular sieves, which at this moment are still studied to achieve full understanding,
and which will soon ﬁnd their way into applications in science and technology.

In this chapter we will be concerned with another new optical application of nano-
porous compound materials, namely microlasers in which light is generated by organic
dyes embedded in wavelength size resonators of molecular sieve material. In these laser
devices the dye molecules are enclosed in nanometer size channel pores of the molecular
sieve, whereas the crystalline sieve material itself which forms the resonator has exterior
dimensions on the order of a few micrometers. Figure 1 illustrates the arrangement
of the molecular dye dipoles which are aligned in the pores of a hexagonally shaped
AlPO4-5 molecular sieve host. In this example of molecular sieve material the channel
pores point to the direction of the crystal c-axis. If the enclosed species of dye molecules
have an elongated shape and exhibit a transition dipole moment along their elongation
axis, then the dipoles end up oriented parallel to the host c-axis as well.

A dipole can not emit in direction of its axis. Therefore the emission of the dipoles
shown in Fig. 1 occurs in a plane normal to the host crystal c-axis. Once the light
emitted by the dipoles arrives at the boundary of the molecular sieve crystal, part of it
is reﬂected back into the material. In fact, given the hexagonal geometry there is even
a bundle of directions for which total internal reﬂection occurs. Figure 2 illustrates how
optical rays of this bundle loop around the crystal, and, reﬂected by the hexagonal sides,
form a whispering gallery mode. In that way regularly shaped crystals of molecular sieve
hosts form microresonator environments for the light emission of inclosed dye molecule
guests, and if the molecules provide suﬃcient optical gain, laser oscillations will build
up [3].

Light emission in a microcavity environment, however, is in many respect diﬀerent

nel pores of the hexagonal molecular sieve host crystal AlPO4-5. The spatial

surface around the dipole axes.

from the familiar emission into free space, such as ﬂuorescence. In fact, this diﬀerence
can be striking. For example, to achieve laser action in a conventional millimeter size
(or larger) laser resonator the pump must overcome a certain threshold. In a microlaser
in which the resonator is of the size of a few wavelengths, however, lasing can occur
without threshold. That means that every absorbed pump quantum is transformed into
a laser photon. Therefore, in order to appreciate the signiﬁcance of light generation in
molecular sieve based microlasers, we need to understand the diﬀerences between the
emission processes of a molecule in a free space environment as opposed to emission in
a microcavity environment.

In the following we will review spontaneous as well as stimulated light emission of

5

molecules, and we will show that the respective emission rate is not an inherent molecular
property, but is a function of its environment, or more precisely, of the mode density
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. This becomes apparent when in the distance of a half to a
few wavelengths of the molecule mirrors exist. But this is indeed exactly the situation
of here discussed dye molecules which are enclosed in a molecular sieve microresonator.
On the other hand, we know that emission and absorption of radiation is accompanied
by a transition of the molecule from a state with energy E1 to a state with energy E2.
/~, where ~ is
The frequency of the emitted or absorbed light is then ω =
Planck’s constant. The presence of ~ clearly shows that emission and absorption of light
is intrinsically a quantum mechanical process. Therefore our discussion will have to
involve the quantum aspects of the interaction of the dye molecules with the light ﬁeld,
as well as the quantum nature of the light ﬁeld itself.

The situation is even more peculiar because the resonators of the molecular sieve
microlasers have a hexagonal outline. For a hexagonal resonator one can not ﬁnd an
orthogonal coordinate system in which the wave equation can be solved by the usual
method of separation of variables. Thus we will have to discuss the properties of mi-
croresonators in view of this impediment.

In consideration of these facts we have organized the discussion in the following way:
In the ﬁrst section we introduce the concept of modes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld as its
countable degrees of freedom, and based on this, we introduce the quantized optical ﬁeld.
In the next section ﬂuorescence, i.e. spontaneous emission in a free space environment
is discussed, and the frame is set for the treatment of cavity eﬀects in the next section,
in which spontaneous emission in a resonator environment is examined. Then the eﬀect
of a resonator on stimulated emission and laser action are surveyed. After this we
characterize the peculiarities of microresonators, and ﬁnally we present the most recent
achievements and realizations of molecular sieve microlasers.

2 The concept of “modes” of the electromagnetic ﬁeld

and its quantization

In optics in general, and particularly when lasers are involved, the notion of modes is
ubiquitous. As this term is used in many diﬀerent and disparate circumstances it is
necessary to deﬁne the term for further usage. In this section we give a short tutorial
introduction of the concept of modes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and we show the im-
portant role the mode concept plays in the procedure of the canonical quantization of the
ﬁeld. An account of the mode structure of resonators and particularly microresonators
is then presented in section 6.

2.1 The dynamics of the classical ﬁeld

A convenient way to introduce the mode concept is to consider a simple realization of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld, for example a source-free ﬁeld. We can think of it as the ﬁeld

6

that subsists after a source located far away has stopped to emit. After the emission
stopped, the classical ﬁeld evolution is governed by Maxwell’s equation in the following
form (cgs-units):

2.2 Discretizing ﬁelds – Random ﬁelds

Most practical light sources, such as incandescent lamps or light emitting diodes LEDs
(though not lasers), emit a nondeterministic, chaotic ﬁeld, i.e. a ﬁeld whose spatio-
temporal evolution can only be described in statistical terms. In communication engi-
neering terms such a ﬁeld is referred to as a noise ﬁeld. We like to point out that we can
understand important features of those ﬁelds in classical terms. It is thus not necessary
to enter the quantum world in order to encounter nondeterministic ﬁelds. In order to
keep the mathematics simple, it is convenient to deal with a ﬁeld occupying a discrete,
instead of a continuous number of degrees of freedom.

The trick usually used to achieve discretization consists in conﬁning the ﬁeld into a
ﬁnite volume V . At the end, the limit V
can be carried out, if necessary. Con-
ﬁnement to a ﬁnite volume V allows us to represent the spatial component of the ﬁeld
as a series (superposition) of a discrete number of functions. As (1) is a system of linear
equations of the ﬁelds ~E and ~B we can always represent a solution as a linear superposi-
tion of ﬁeld functions. Of course it is convenient to choose a complete and orthonormal
set of functions
, that also fulﬁll eventually given boundary conditions. These
functions are called (spatial) modes. Thus a mode of the classical electromagnetic ﬁeld
is characterized by the following properties:

2.3 The classical Hamiltonian of the source-free ﬁeld

For a source-free ﬁeld the classical Hamiltonian H can be interpreted as the total energy
of the ﬁeld. As we have constrained the ﬁeld to the Volume V , the total energy is given
by [4]:

H =

[ε0 ~E2(~r, t) +

~B2(~r, t)] dV

In the following we will show that the Hamiltonian (7) can be represented as a sum of
terms that are analogous to a harmonic oscillator (The thoughtful reader anticipates the
reason...). For that purpose we express the ﬁelds ~E and ~B in terms of their potential.

2.3.1 The potential of the free ﬁeld

2.3.2 Discretization procedure for the potential A

We follow the thread outlined in section 2.2, and to keep things simple, we consider a
cube shaped volume V with an edge length of L. With this conditions the discretization
of ~A acquires the form of a Fourier series (plane wave expansion):

As (14) ﬁxes the transversal character of each plane wave mode, only two components

simplify the notation let us agree to let index ~k point to n1, n2, n3 (see (12)), as well as
to the polarization components ~ξ1, ~ξ2. To remember this, we will from now on refer to
the corresponding index as kξ. With this notation we can write for the potential

where with ~ξ we represent the polarization unit-vector. We note that the total informa-
tion on the (classical) ﬁeld is now contained in the functions ukξ(t) (19).

Note: To avoid confusion, we have to point to a minor inconsistency in the notation:
As is typical for expressions of the magnetic ﬁeld, the vector product in (22) reshuﬄes
spatial and polarization indices so that the correct expression in fact consists of two sums
containing the polarization vector. The resulting expression looks bulky, and requires
some consideration. For this tutorial we prefer to emphasize the basic mathematical
structure. So we choose this visually intuitive representation although the indices are
not correctly rendered. To obtain the correct result one may work out the procedure in
the component notation of (20) and (9).

Let us return for a moment to the volume L3 we considered for deriving the mode expan-
sion (11), which was a cube with edges oriented along the coordinate axes (x1, x2, x3).
According to (11) we can expand the ﬁeld in this cube in a 3-dimensional set of run-
[cf. (12)]. Along the x1-axis we have the modes labeled by

ning modes
{
k1 = 2πn1/L; (n1 =
2, . . . ); because we consider only running modes (travelling

waves), we omit n1 = 0. In the interval between k1 and k1 + dk1 we ﬁnd dn1 modes,
where dn1 = dk1 L/2π. The analogous applies for the other directions. According to
Fig. 3 we can specify the number of modes in the interval between
simply
by counting the dots in the volume of the corresponding spherical shell, which amounts
to 4πk2 dk
2 (factor 2 because there are two independent polarization states associated
with each ~k). Considering the scaling of the axes in Fig. 3 we can use this to express
the number of modes in Volume V = L3 as

In this representation we take into account that ζ can depend on the polarization,
which can be expressed as ζ = ζ(φ, θ, k). Also, ζ allows us to introduce ~k-space structure
functions into the mode counting sum, so that the mode density can be calculated for
arbitrary boundary conditions. Note that the procedure relies on certain properties of the
ﬁeld, one of which is (7). This equation expresses energy conservation, thus the above
calculated mode density refers to undamped modes. The situation with microlasers,
where sources of the ﬁeld are present and the modes are damped, is more intricate and
is discussed in section 6.

The energy appears here as the sum of the energy of each mode. This is intuitive, and
at this point we could stop satisﬁed with the result. However, there is one thing that
experience revealed: As elegant it might be, expression (29) does not lend itself to an
idea that opens a viable way for the quantization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

Although at this time it looks utterly artiﬁcial, but the following substitution proved

to be a wonderfully proliﬁc device:

qkξ (t) =
pkξ(t) =

[ukξ(t) + u∗kξ(t)]
u∗kξ(t)]

iωkξ[ukξ(t)

−

−

At this time this expressions can be regarded as the deﬁnition for the functions q and
ω2qkξ . Thus the
p that, as can be shown, satisfy the relations ˙qkξ = pkξ and ˙pkξ =
functions q and p evolve in analogy to the canonical position and momentum variables of
the harmonic oscillator: In fact, inserting (30) and (31) in (29), we obtain the expression

which has the same form as the Hamiltonian of a series of independent (not coupled)
harmonic oscillators.

What do we have achieved so far?

1. By restricting the ﬁelds to a ﬁnite Volume V , the potential of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld was decomposed in a discrete, although inﬁnite, series of spatial modes.

(29)

(30)

(31)

2. Each spatial mode was associated with a harmonic oscillator.

3. That this is a sound result can be seen by verifying the canonical equations of

motion, which indeed show that ∂H/∂pkξ = ˙qkξ and ∂H/∂qkξ =

˙pkξ.

Thinking about quantization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld? Well, quantizing a harmonic

oscillator - we know how to do this, don’t we?

2.4 Canonical quantization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld

We assume that the reader is familiar with the postulates of quantum mechanics in
general, and with the quantum mechanics of the harmonic oscillator in particular (see for
example [5]). In anticipation of the following procedures, we have already put together
the main constituents we need to apply the correspondence principle [5, p. 337ﬀ] for
quantizing the ﬁeld. As ﬁrst step we associate with each of the classical dynamic variables
a Hilbert-space operator. At this time we choose operators in the Heisenberg picture.
In this way the correspondence to the classical formulas is more obvious. As always in
quantum mechanics we also have to carefully consider commutation of the operators.

According to the correspondence principle intent [6, 7], we associate the following

operators with the classical canonical variables (30) and (31):

The operators q and p of the same mode represent noncompatible operators. We use
that the commutator of a canonically conjugated pair of operators amounts to i~. On
the other hand, equation (32) indicates that the modes (oscillators) are uncoupled.
Therefore the associated Hilbert-space operators of diﬀerent modes will commute. Thus
we obtain the following commutation relations:

The state of a quantum mechanical system – here the electromagnetic ﬁeld – is char-
. The measurement of the observable O will
acterized by a state vector, say the ket
i
produce a value coinciding with an eigenvalue of the Hilbert space operator O associated
with the observable O. However, only when the state of the ﬁeld
happens to be an
eigenstate of the operator O, we can precisely predict the outcome of the measurement
of O. If the state of the system does not coincide with an eigenstate of O, then it is only
possible to predict the probability to obtain a certain eigenvalue. Thus the outcome
of the measurement of O is predicted by the probability distribution given through the
scalar product

At this point the proﬁt we gained by reinterpreting the classical Hamiltonian (29) in
the form of (32) becomes apparent. By identifying the classical observables in (32) with
the operators (37) and (37), we obtain a Hamiltonian operator that exhibits required
quantum properties. Thus

Note that with the transposition of the classical problem into Hilbert space, the variable
space was transposed as well: The new dynamic variables now are the operators q kξ(t),
pkξ(t), as well as the ﬁeld operators ~A(~r, t), ~E(~r, t), ~B(~r, t), etc.. The classical variables
~r and t are now relegated to play the role of mere parameters.

In the following we try to ﬁnd out why the analogous transposition of the classical
Hamiltonian (29) fails to produce a Hamiltonian operator that is consistent with the
quantum mechanical postulates. We will start to seek the quantum mechanical equiv-
alent of mode functions ukξ(t) appearing in (30) and (31). Obviously these must be
operators.

2.5 Creation and annihilation operators

Similarly as the classically equivalent functions in (30) and (31) are complex conju-
gates, the annihilation and creation operators are Hermitian adjoints, which is expressed
by the symbol †. Since a†kξ
= akξ(t), they are not themselves Hermitian but Hermitian
adjoints, and thus can not qualify as physical observables. Like q kξ(t) and pkξ(t) they
are not compatible (do not commute). From (38) and (40) we obtain the commutation
relations

However the dynamic variables q kξ(t) and pkξ (t) are Hermitian, and can consequently
be associated with observables

total information about the ﬁeld. As the information of each quantized ﬁeld mode is
now expressed in terms of an operator, instead of simple c-numbers, we must expect a
correspondingly richer structure of the quantized ﬁeld – richness in the sense that in the
quantum description, non classical ﬁeld conﬁgurations arise that do not have a classical
equivalent.

We can now express the Hamiltonian operator in terms of annihilation and creation

operators. We insert (51) and (52) into (43) and obtain

In this equation the annihilation and the creation operators appear in a symmetric
way. From its visual appearance (53) can be considered to closely resemble the classical
Hamiltonian (29). An the other side we have to consider that annihilation and creation

operators do not commute, and the apparent symmetry may only be a typographical
one. There is no doubt that the Hamiltonian operator per se is Hermitian and thus
represents an observable, the energy of the ﬁeld. The energy of an optical ﬁeld is usually
measured by absorbing the light in a photo detector, say for example a photo diode. As
will become obvious below [c.f. (58)-(60)] for the description of absorption processes it is
practical to have the Hamiltonian operator in a form in which the annihilation operators
stand to the right of the creation operators. This normal ordering form is achieved by
successive application of the commutation relations (48)-(50). As a result we obtain

(54)

Obviously the operator product a†kξ (t)akξ(t) is Hermitian, and represents the number
operator Nkξ

Nkξ = a†kξ

(t)akξ(t)

.

As its name indicates, Nkξ counts the number of photons in each mode kξ. Note that
because of (46) and (47) the number operator Nkξ is constant in time – a mandatory
property for a conserved quantity of the ﬁeld, like H (54). The eigenvalues of the
Hamiltonian operator (54) are ~ωkξ ×
. It is evident
that nkξ represents the photon occupation number of mode kξ. In (54) the contribution
~ωkξ to each mode represents the vacuum ﬂuctuations of the ﬁeld. Clearly, this term
of 1

is not present in the classical Hamiltonian (29).

∞

At this point we should have discussed the eigenfunctions of the annihilation and
creation operators. We postpone the discussion to the following section.
in which
we introduce the coherent states, and were we are able to better illustrate the special
meaning of those eigenstates.

Summarizing we can now reconstruct the reasons why the direct application of the
correspondence principle to the classical Hamiltonian expression (29) fails, but works on
(32):

•

•

The correspondence principle refers to physical observables. On the other side,
from the perspective of classical physics, the concept of observables is not well
deﬁned, and therefore it is not possible to anticipate that the operators a and a†
associated with the classical mode functions ukξ(t) and u∗kξ(t) are not Hermitian
and thus do not represent observables.

In the representations of the classical Hamiltonian the mode functions ukξ(t) and
u∗kξ(t) enter in a symmetric way. The normal ordering procedure of the operators a
and a† in the Hamiltonian operator shows, however, that the equivalent operators
~ωkξ representing
do not contribute equally to the Hamiltonian. In (54) the factor 1
2
the vacuum ﬂuctuations is a result of this asymmetry. Since vacuum ﬂuctuations
do not exist in the classical picture, the term could not be anticipated.

2.6 States of the optical ﬁeld

In classical physics the information of the electrodynamic ﬁeld is contained in the electric
and magnetic ﬁelds, or their associated potential functions. In the quantum description,
however, the information is contained in a state vector (wave function). In the following
we discuss two important states of the ﬁeld, the Fock states (or number states, states of
ﬁxed photon number), and the coherent states (harmonically oscillating ﬁelds).

A practical way to represent a state vector is in terms of a series of eigenstates of a

suitable operator, and this is what we are going to do as next.

2.6.1 The Fock states (number states)

The Fock states are deﬁned as states with a ﬁxed photon number. Thus they can be
represented as eigenstates of the number operator (55). Considering the mode kξ, we
have the following eigenvalue equation

in which nkξ represents the number of photons in mode kξ. The Fock states are stationary

a being not Hermitian, it is not surprising that the associated eigenstates, the coherent

, are not orthogonal. Thus they can not provide a universally suitable base
system. Although coherent states can therefore not be used to expand an arbitrary
electromagnetic ﬁeld in the conventional way (see below), they represent an important
class of ﬁelds, namely harmonically oscillating ﬁelds, like radio frequency ﬁelds, or ﬁelds
emitted by well stabilized lasers, and for this reason are interesting to characterize.

Fock states as eigenstates of the number operator have an intuitive meaning, and
therefore we will seek a representation of the coherent states as a superposition of Fock
states. As the coherent state is the quantum analogue of a harmonically oscillating ﬁeld,
we shall determine the corresponding electric ﬁeld operator E as well.

Formally we ﬁnd the expansion of the coherent state in the Fock base with the usual

trick of inserting the unit operator (63):

We derived the coherent states as eigenvectors of a nonhermitian operator. According

2.6.3 The operator of the electric ﬁeld E

According to the correspondence principle we construct the electric ﬁeld operator E
corresponding to (34) by replacing the classical canonical variables q and p with the
operators (51) and (52). For the mode we consider this leads to

is often called electric ﬁeld per photon. Expression (81) particularly illustrates the fol-
lowing points:

•

•

•

•

•

The ﬁeld consists of two components oscillating in quadrature.

The operators q(t = 0) and p(t = 0) associated with the quadratures are Hermitian
and constant in time.

However, q(t = 0) and p(t = 0) are not compatible. That means the quadratures
are not simultaneously measurable quantities, a result that from a classical point
of view can not be anticipated.

The quantum properties of the ﬁeld, including its ﬂuctuations, are determined at
one time, for example t = 0, and do not change at later times (provided the ﬁeld
is not further manipulated).

As the two ﬁeld quadrature operators are not compatible, we should not be sur-
prised that it is not possible to construct a Hermitian operator for the phase of
the ﬁeld.

2.6.4 The uncertainties of the coherent state

Remember that the coherent states are deﬁned as eigenstates of the annihilation operator
and not of the quadrature operators q and p. Therefore, the expectation value of latter
observables can not be exactly deﬁned, but will exhibit an amount of uncertainty. In
addition, we have seen that the quadrature operators are incompatible, thus, they obey
the uncertainty relation (42). Let us now determine the uncertainty product ∆q∆p for
a coherent state. (Note that (∆A)2 =

and for their product

This results shows that this uncertainty product assumes the minimum value allowed by
Heisenberg’s famous relation; cf. (42). Thus, the coherent state is a minimum uncertainty
state, and can be considered to be as close to the equivalent classical state as quantum
mechanics permits.

To conclude this section we use (84) and (85) to visualize the nature of the coherent
state. For that purpose we write the expectation values of the quadratures in their time
dependent form. In (81) we can see that already the operators exhibit a purely scalar
time dependence (c-number). Thus

We said that the coherent state represents the quantum mechanical analogue of a
classical, harmonically oscillating ﬁeld. Most people connect this with images of same
sort of antenna and radio frequency ﬁelds. In fact, we are used to modern electronic
10 s).
devices which process radio frequency cycle times of up to some tens of ps (10−
15 s-scale.
For optical frequencies, however, electrons would have to respond on the 10−

22

Circuits with such fast responses are not available yet. The standard way to receive
optical signals is therefore not with an antenna, but with a photo detector, such as a
photodiode or a photomultiplier. In a photo detector an incident photon liberates an
electron. The generated photoelectrons may then be processed with available electronic
devices. For the ideal detector (photon to electron conversion eﬃciency, or quantum
eﬃciency, η = 1) we can thus regard the electron current at the detector output as an
exact image of the photon current at the input.

In practice we are thus faced with the following question: how does the ﬁeld state
translates into practically observable features of the photo current? This question can
only be answered in statistical terms. If we assume that the optical ﬁeld consists of one
mode in a coherent state, then (75) contains the answer. The probability to ﬁnd the
detector output releasing n electrons is therefore given by the same Poisson distribution

,

¯n2

e−

(99)

p(n) =

¯n2n
n!
The Poisson distribution characterizes a point process (here the process of outputting
photons, or electrons respectively), that means that the quanta are emitted indepen-
dently and therefore only exhibit delta function like correlations. Loosely speaking, the
Poisson distribution is the distribution with the “most random” properties – most ran-
dom also in the sense that the underlying process can be realized in the greatest number
of diﬀerent ways. It is interesting to realize that the state that reveals the most random
distribution if we detect its quanta, reveals a perfectly determined oscillatory evolution
in case we choose to detect its electric ﬁeld. Anyway, from the properties of the photo
electron distribution (99) and the underlying Poisson (or point) process we can deduce
the statistical measures we are interested in, like photo electron current average over an
interval τ (which is ¯nτ ), its standard deviation (which is √¯nτ ), or its spectrum (which
for a point process is the Fourier transform of delta function).

·

Let us now consider a ﬁeld, which was emitted by a single mode laser, say 1 mW
at 500 nm wavelength. Because the laser is well stabilized this ﬁeld corresponds to a
coherent state. According to above discussion the number of emitted photons per second
1015 photons per second, and the standard
¯n/τ corresponding to 1 mW amounts to 2.5
107 photons per second. (After photo
deviation (RMS shot noise) of the current is 5
detection the photons appear as electrons.) In this quantum detection picture, what
makes us saying that the coherent state represents the quantum mechanical analogue
of a classical, harmonically oscillating ﬁeld? The quantum mechanical aspect of the

coherent state is its noise, here 5
becomes visible if we imagine adding or removing one photon to the coherent state. In
principle we disturb the quantum state by such a manipulation. But already for coherent
states with few photons ¯n, this perturbation is smaller than the RMS shot noise level.
15 of the average current, which
In above example the perturbation is in the order of 10−
6. Clearly such a perturbation is very hard, if ever,
ﬂuctuates naturally by a factor of 10−
to detect. The classical property of the coherent state therefore is its insensitivity for
disturbances on the level of a few quanta. This quasi classical behavior of the coherent
state forms the basis on which the semiclassical approach for describing the interaction

107 s−

·

of atoms or molecules (quantum objects) with the optical ﬁeld (classical object) is built.
For that purpose we keep only the terms that are signiﬁcant for a ﬁeld with a large
number of photons (limit ~
2 in the Hamiltonian
(54), resulting in the semiclassical Hamiltonian

(100)

Another interesting property is the following: A coherent state can be generated by
a point process. If we attenuate the ﬁeld with another point process, the result is still
a coherent state, although one with a reduced ¯n. Most practical attenuators, like grey
glass, or semi transparent mirrors, are such attenuators. This is certainly a property
we are used to expect for a classical, harmonically oscillating ﬁeld, but which is not
automatically true for an arbitrary realization of a quantum state.

Where do we stand now? When we started this discussion we assumed a source
free ﬁeld. As we have stated at the beginning, we have to imagine this as the ﬁeld
that subsists after a source located far away has stopped to emit. This assumption
allowed us to learn about some essential features of the basic quantum properties of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld. For example, (81) illustrates that if the source were harmonic,
the state of the radiated ﬁeld consists of a coherent state, and the spectrum an observer
records shows a single sharp line at frequency ω. From a practical point of view such
ﬁelds are not very useful. Who ever wants to wait until some charges in a distant galaxy
stopped to wiggle so that we can receive their coherent ﬁeld in our laboratory to start
the important spectroscopic investigation we plan to? No, we need ﬁelds we can turn
on and oﬀ in the way we need them. That means, we need the sources in our hands,
in our laboratory. The sources we are particularly interested in are molecular sieve
microcrystals that contain ﬂuorescent dye molecules, and under favorable conditions
these molecular-sieve-dye compounds can emit laser radiation.

So let us proceed the discussion with the simplest source of an optical ﬁeld, a single,
ﬂourescent molecule. This is not an unrealistic situation. It is the very simplicity of
this arrangement that makes a single molecule an important device for exploring the
spectroscopic properties of various chemical and biological environments [9, 10].

3 Fluorescence in free space

With ﬂuorescence we designate the spontaneous emission of photons by atoms or mole-
cules. The photon is emitted into a mode of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, so augmenting its
photon number. Simultaneously the atom or molecule transits from an electronic state
of energy E2 to one of lower energy E1. The frequency of the emitted photon then is
E1)/~. The presence of Planck’s constant ~ in the description of this process
ω = (E2 −
indicates that it is a quantum mechanical process. However, real atoms, even more real
molecules, are complicated systems, which even in their most simple realization, namely
hydrogen, exhibit a non-trivial structure of states. We therefore are forced to simplify

24

the reality. For the purpose of this discussion we will restrict ourselves to the simplest
model of an atom or molecule, the two-level atom or molecule [11]. In the following we
use the term “system” to spare using bulky “atom or molecule”.

Hermitian operators a and a†, which lowered, respectively raised the excitation of the ﬁeld
mode by one quantum (photon) ~ω. Similarly we now introduce the atomic operators b
and b† which lower and raise the energy of the atom (molecule) by ~ω0. Unlike the ﬁeld,

3.1.1 Analogy to spin-1/2 system

All quantum systems characterized by only two possible states are mathematically equiv-
alent. The prototype of such a system is the spin- 1
2 particle in a magnetic ﬁeld. We
thus can borrow from this formalism [12, 13]. Be aware that unfortunately many tech-
nical terms keep their original names, although here they refer to a completely diﬀerent
physical system.

To describe physical observables of the two-level system at hand, we need Hermitian
operators. Borrowing from the mentioned theory we deﬁne the following set of three
traceless Pauli spin operators 2

however, they are not related to any spin. But because they form a linearly indepen-

two-dimensional Hilbert space of two-level atoms or molecules. Therefore, any system
operator O can be represented as a series of Pauli spin operators

where the coeﬃcients gα are determined by O. The operators (108) satisfy the following

If, like in our ﬁgure (cf. Fig. 5) the lower state is the system ground state, then E0 = 1

and HA = ~ω0(R3 + 1

2) = ~ω0b†b.

In the following we will elucidate the physical signiﬁcance of the other Hermitian
variables R1 and R2. Those operators are closely related to the dipole moment µ. For
atoms, ions or molecules the dipole moment can be deﬁned as

µ =

therefore note that ~µ11 and ~µ22 represent expectation values for the dipole moment
in the lower and upper system state, respectively. However, we know that the dipole
moment has an odd parity, and therefore those coeﬃcients must vanish. Because the
dipole moment is a Hermitian operator we thus obtain

In this example we have illustrated how the operators R1, R2 are related to
the dipole moment operator µ.

As next we will derive an expression for the rate of change of the dipole moment
operator µ. (In above example of the hydrogen atom the rate of change of µ would
correspond to the electron velocity v multiplied by e.) In general, the rate of change
of an observable is determined by Heisenberg’s equation of motion, which in this case

3.1.3 Bloch-representation of the state

can be represented as the linear combination

The correspondence between the Bloch vector and the density matrix is a consequence of
the properties of the respective symmetry groups, namely the correspondence between
the real orthogonal group O3 and the special unitary group SU2. Note, that also the
Stokes vector that is often used to represent the polarization state of light (see e.g. [15])
has O3 symmetry.

This result shows that the Bloch-vector components can be interpreted as weights in the

The symmetry of the Bloch-vector representation (cf. Fig. 6) suggests a representation
of ~r in polar coordinates (r, θ, φ) rather than Cartesian coordinates (r1, r2, r3). From

3.1.4 Spin operator expectation values

In (138) we have illustrated the relation between the spin operators Rα and the Bloch-
vectors components rα. In the following we calculate the expectation values of the spin
operators for the system in an arbitrary quantum state which is characterized by the
density operator ρ(A):

The product of two diﬀerent operators R gives either R1, R2, or R3, which all have

The components of the Bloch vector can thus also be interpreted in terms of the expec-
tation values of the spin operators.

We can now calculate the expectation of the energy (116) as

In the same way the expectation value of the dipole moment (123) is given by

From this equations we can see that the z-component of the Bloch vector is associated
with the energy of the two-level system, whereas the x- and y-components are related
to its dipole moment. For a two-level system without a permanent dipole moment the
expectation value of the operator µ must vanish in the lower, as well as in the upper
state. In those states the operator µ is not well deﬁned and its value ﬂuctuates. From
(119) or (123) we can see that

µ2 =

the following we will now discuss these interactions.

3.2 Interaction of a two-level system with a classical

electromagnetic ﬁeld

Let us assume that the classical electromagnetic ﬁeld is described by its electric ﬁeld ~E,
and that the two-level system is located at a ﬁxed point in space and its dipole moment
is characterized by the operator µ. Also, the typical wavelength of the ﬁeld is much
larger than the length of the dipoles. The interaction energy HI is then given by the
usual expression for the potential energy of a dipole in an electric ﬁeld. With (123) we
can write

HI =

We have given two interaction Hamiltonians, (148) and (150). Depending on the problem
at hand one can choose the more appropriate one, although in most cases they lead to
similar results. The total energy of the system in the ﬁeld consists of the sum

Thus, in the presence of a classical ﬁeld the length of the Bloch vector remains constant.
That means a pure state stays pure, and a mixed state remains mixed. The structure
of (154) led Feynman et al. [16] to propose an interesting geometric interpretation. For

~r precesses around the vector ~Q with a frequency that is given by the magnitude of ~Q.
When ~Q itself varies with time, the precession motion may become complicated. We
may evaluate the matrix element (
) using (148) or (150). For example, with

3.2.2 The rotating wave approximation

As an example to illustrate the rotating wave approximation, let us compare now tran-
sitions with ∆m = 1 and ∆m = 0. In the case ∆m = 1 the vector ~µ12 has the form

~µ12 =

~ex + i~ey

(~ex, ~ey are unit vectors) .

(161)

In addition, assume an external ﬁeld that is circularly polarized and propagating in the
z-direction, thus

~ε =

Then we obtain for the scalar products

~ε = 0 ,

Looking at the two cases of the ﬁeld interaction, the ﬁrst with a ∆m = 1-system, the
second with a ∆m = 0-system, (164) and (166) seem to be rather diﬀerent from (167)
and (168). However, Allen and Eberley [11, sect. 2.4] have shown that they only diﬀer by
some anti-resonant terms. Comparing the expressions for ~Q we can see that (168) can be

over a characteristic time interval, say ∆t > 1/ω0, the contributions of the fast precessing
auxiliary vector ~Q are small. To a good approximation we can therefore neglect the
auxiliary vector ~Q. If we drop the auxiliary ~Q, then the ∆m = 0 interaction with linearly
polarized light is described by the same set of equations as the ∆m = 1 interaction with
circularly polarized light. This is known as the rotating wave approximation.

3.2.3 Bloch equations in a rotating frame

Let us go back to (164). This set of equations describes a rotation around the z-axis
at an optical frequency. We will now introduce a rotating reference frame, in which the
motion of the Bloch vector ~r is slower. At ﬁrst sight, Eq. (164) seems to justify the
atomic (or system) frequency ω0 as a suitable choice. But after we consider that the
atomic frequency in a spectroscopic sample varies from atom to atom, we realize that the
frequency of the applied ﬁeld ω1 is better suited if we want to refer the time evolution
of all the diﬀering atoms to the same reference frame. The transformation from the
stationary frame ~r = (r1.r2, r3) to the rotating frame ~r ′ = (r′1.r′2, r′3) is given by

where Θ is the 3

3 orthonormal rotation matrix

~r ′ = Θ~r ,

Let us now transform Bloch equations (164) to the rotating (primed) frame. For that

we rewrite (164) in matrix form as

where C is the 3

3 coeﬃcient matrix. Inserting (169) we obtain

We can see that the Bloch vector ~r ′ precesses around ~Q ′ with the frequency depending
1/2 and the orientation of ~Q ′. If the initial direction of the Bloch
on
vector ~r ′ is approximately parallel to ~Q ′, then ~r ′ precesses around ~Q ′ on a cone with
small angle, and this cone tends to follow slow variations of the direction of ~Q ′. This is
called adiabatic following, and can be used to prepare the quantum states of atoms.

3.2.4 The Rabi solution

In the following we discuss the interaction with a sinusoidal exciting ﬁeld (well stabilized

of a two-level system with such a ﬁeld was given by Rabi [12] when he studied a spin

3.3 Interaction of a two-level system with a quantum ﬁeld

up

According to the postulates of quantum mechanics, a two-level system initially in its
will stay there for all times in the absence of an interaction. Experience
excited state
shows, however, that normally the system will return to its ground state
after a
certain time. In the last sections we discussed how the interaction with a classical ﬁeld
can change the occupation of states. On the other hand, spontaneous emission is a
quantum mechanical process, and its description requires the quantization of both, the

atoms and the ﬁeld. A result of this theory is that the rate of spontaneous emission is
proportional to the mode density of the surrounding environment.

To illustrate this theory we start with the interaction of a two-level system with a single
mode of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The total Hamiltonian thus consists of a component
describing the two-level system HA, the component of the electromagnetic ﬁeld HF , and
the interaction Hamiltonian HI

Htot = HA + HF + HI ,

(176)

where the two-level system Hamiltonian HA is given by (115), and where for the purpose
of this short overview we insert the ﬁeld Hamiltonian HF in its semiclassical form (100)
restricted to one mode kξ. The interaction is described by a Hamiltonian analogous to
(148), in which the ﬁeld is expressed as Hilbert space operator

This result shows, that the initially unoccupied ground state

On the other hand, above result for Plo exhibits an oscillatory behavior at Rabi fre-
quency Ω, which is in contrast to experience where the decay is irreversible. In the simple
model described by (181) the two-level system interacts with only one ﬁeld mode, which
also is undamped. Therefore the two-level system can reabsorb the photon from the
ﬁeld, so returning to its initial state. Later on we will discuss how recent experimental
progress has allowed to observe this oscillatory regime. But for the moment, we will
discuss how spontaneous emission becomes irreversible, when the photon is emitted into
a multimode vacuum ﬁeld.

3.4 The Fermi golden rule

where the last term describing the interaction is the multimode interaction Hamiltonian
HI; cf. the single mode Hamiltonian (180).

Similar as above in the single mode case we assume that all the modes of the ﬁeld are
initially in their vacuum state and that the two-level system is in its excited state, so
that we can write

If we restrict ourselves to times t close enough to t = 0 so that the initial coeﬃcients do
not change signiﬁcantly, we can approximate a(t) in (190) by its initial value a(t = 0) = 1

where the sum collects the contributions of every mode which the two-level system can
couple with. Here we can see for the ﬁrst time, how the structure of the mode space
aﬀects the spontaneous emission: As the sum only gets positive contributions it clearly
increases when the number of participating modes increases, so reducing the probability
Pup. Since the frequency bandwidth over which the dipole moment couples with the
ﬁeld is limited, so actually the number of modes per frequency interval is the signiﬁcant
parameter governing the size of the sum. And this parameter depends on the geometry
of the space in which the ﬂuorescent system can radiate into. This is the observation
on which attempts to modify the spontaneous emission rate will hook on. We will come
back to this in a moment.

When the two-level system radiates into a space which is densely populated with
modes, such as free space for example, then it couples to a whole continuum of modes
over which we have to extend the summation. Mathematically this means replacing the
sum in (192) over the modes kξ by an integral. We discussed this problem in part 2.3,
where we obtained the transformation rule (28). If we equate ζ in (28) with (191) where
we insert (165) for the vacuum Rabi frequency with (83) as electric ﬁeld, we can work
out the integrals and we obtain

An other approach to solve the dynamical equations for the coeﬃcients a and b (189),
(190) was introduced by Weisskopf and Wigner [20]. They start by formally integrating
(190), and inserting this result in (189), which will produce

The construction of the dependent superposition of states (187) was such that compared
with all other time dependent functions the variation in a and b is slow, and therefore
we assume that the variation of a(t) in (199) is much slower than in the exponential as
well, and can thus be pulled out of the time integration. At the end we may check, if
this assumption is consistent with the result. Because of

3.6 Reservoir theory and master equation

In the last two paragraphs we have seen how the irreversibility of spontaneous emission
emerged when the source was coupled with a quantized ﬁeld, more exactly, its vacuum
modes. Notwithstanding, the Hamiltonians are perfectly energy conserving, so the ap-
parent nonreversible dynamics of the system comes somewhat surprising and its physical
reason is rather obscure. With the reservoir theory approach we will discuss as next,
we will be able to gain a more intuitive understanding of the physical processes which
lead to the nonreversible decay of the excited level of a two-level system [21, p. 374ﬀ].
In reservoir theory we shift the perspective from the particular two-level system coupled
with the ﬁeld to a more general situation, which is a small system coupled to a large
system. We characterize the small system by its Hamiltonian Hs, the large system by
Hr, and their coupling by the interaction Hamiltonian V. Thus: H = Hs + Hr + V. For
our particular case the small system can be identiﬁed with the two-level system and the
large system with the continuum of modes of the ﬁeld. In addition we assume that the
large system always stays in thermal equilibrium at some temperature T . This means it
acts as a thermal reservoir. A thermal reservoir is usually described by an equilibrium
(i.e. time independent) density operator of the form

ρr =

Hr/kBT ) ,

(203)

(204)

(205)

where with kB we denote Boltzman’s constant, and the partition function Z is given by
the trace over the reservoir Trr

Now, we are interested in the dynamics of the small system only. In that case we can

ﬁnd the dynamics in the evolution of the reduced density operator ρs

ρs = Trr

ρsr

,

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

where ρsr is the density operator associated with the full system, i.e. small system and
reservoir. Thus the reduced density operator ρs is the trace over the reservoir of the
total density operator. If we know the reduced density operator at any time t we can
calculate the expectation value of any system operator. The equation of motion for ρsr
is called a master equation, and this is what we will derive in the following. In order
to focus directly to the relevant dynamic time scale of the system, we switch to the
interaction picture, where all the free evolution is eliminated. The interaction between
the small system and the reservoir is described by the Schr¨odinger picture interaction
Hamiltonian V, for which the interaction picture representation VI(t
t0) is obtained by
the unitary transformation

ing the associated principal part frequency shifts, combining the diﬀerent contributions

In contrast to (199) of the Weisskopf-Wigner theory, (220) gives us some insight into the
processes leading to the decay of the excited state. Together with (221), (220) relates the
decay with properties of the reservoir expressed as ﬁrst order correlation functions. The
approximation of these correlation functions with delta functions is known as the Markov
approximation. The decay appears thus as a result of the delta function like memory
time of the reservoir which instantaneously looses track of the interaction with the two
level system. So the way of the excitation back to the two level system is forgotten, so
to speak. Combining the Markov approximation with second-order perturbation theory
to derive the master equation is usually labeled Born-Markov approximation.

The master equation (221) describes the decay of a two-level system which is coupled
to an electromagnetic ﬁeld characterized as a reservoir at temperature T . In this equation
¯n represents the number of thermal quanta of the reservoir at the two-level transition
energy ~ω0. For a reservoir at zero temperature, the population Pup of the excited state
of the two-level system is given by

3.6.1 Harmonic oscillator coupled to a reservoir

In section 2.4 we have shown, that one mode of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is mathemat-
ically equivalent to a harmonic oscillator to which in the semiclassical approximation
we can associate the Hamiltonian HF = ~ωk a†kak (cf. (100)), where the wavenumber
k labels the particular mode. The advantage of reservoir theory is that the particular
structure of the reservoir does not aﬀect the result, as long as the reservoir stays in ther-
mal equilibrium at all times, and that perturbations of its state decorrelate immediately
in a Markovian sense. We can therefore imagine the reservoir as a large collection of
harmonic oscillators which are in thermal equilibrium at temperature T . For this situ-
ation, namely the harmonic oscillator associated with the ﬁeld mode, which is coupled
to a reservoir of harmonic oscillators, we can work out the calculations in analogy to
section 3.6, and we obtain the following master equation

where ¯n represents the number of thermal excitations of the harmonic oscillator at

expectation value of the annihilation operator a (which is proportional to the positive
frequency part of the electric ﬁeld mode) decays with a rate of κ/2.

4 Spontaneous emission in an optical resonator

Up to now we have shown that spontaneous emission is a consequence of the coupling
of the atomic or molecular system to its surrounding electromagnetic ﬁeld which in the

48

last section we assumed to be the “universe” composed of a continuum of plane wave
modes. Thus, spontaneous emission is not a generic property of the atom or molecule,
but depends on the mode structure of the surrounding environment. Purcell [24] found
out that the spontaneous emission rate can be enhanced by placing an atom into a res-
onator in which a mode is tuned to the atomic transition frequency, and Kleppner [25]
described the opposite case, inhibition of spontaneous emission. Spontaneous emission
needs not be irreversible. Irreversibility is a consequence of the coupling with a Marko-
vian Reservoir, i.e. a reservoir with a very short memory. For vacuum modes which can
not be approximated in this way, spontaneous emission can exhibit considerable diﬀerent
properties, as in the case of long memory times, where the excitation can be periodically
exchanged between the atom or molecule and the ﬁeld [26, 27].

In the microstructures discussed in section 7 the atoms or molecules are coupled to
one, or a few, resonator modes. However, in section 6 we show that in wavelength size
microresonators it is inevitable that the resonator modes couple with the continuum of
modes of the external world as well. This, if the resonator cavity is not completely closed
around the atom (or molecule), it can couple to the continuum of vacuum modes. In
an optical resonator we therefore have to consider at least tree coupling coeﬃcients: (1)
The Rabi frequency Ω (165) which characterizes the atom (or molecule) coupling with
the resonator modes, (2) the decay rate κ of the resonator mode, and (3) the rate γr
of spontaneous emission into the vacuum modes to which the system couples with. In
wavelength scale resonators γr diﬀers from the spontaneous emission rate into free space
γfs because of the reduced mode density in the resonator. If the system couples with
more than one ﬁeld mode or when more than two levels are involved, then we have to
consider the associated coeﬃcients as well.

To illustrate this concept we consider a linear resonator build with two ideal mirrors
spaced by the distance L (Fabry-P´erot interferometer). The space between the mirrors
deﬁnes the resonator. If we neglect diﬀraction losses at the mirrors, the modes of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld in this resonator of volume V consist of a discrete set of standing
waves with frequency ωn = ckn = cπn/L, where n is an integer. In section 6 we will
show that also transversal modes exist, which we neglect in this example. If the cavity is
small enough the mode frequencies are well separated, so that only one of them couples
with the transition of the two level system. We label this mode frequency with ωr and
with ω0 we denote the frequency of the two-level transition (nearly resonant mode).
In reality the mirrors are not perfect and the ﬁeld is diﬀracted, so that the mode is
damped. We characterize the damping by the damping rate κ. Damping of the ﬁeld
mode is tantamount to widening the mode frequency to a width proportional to κ. In
analogy to the free space mode density (25) we can associate an eﬀective mode density
ρr with the damped mode situation in which the two-level system now radiates into. If
we assume that the mode width is less than the separation of the mode frequency, the
eﬀective mode density can be approximated by a Lorentzian as

sion rate into exterior vacuum modes (because of the mirrors, the solid angle
which determines the coupling to exterior modes diﬀers from the free space
case), and κ describes the decay rate of the ﬁeld mode due to diﬀraction losses,

We can calculate the spontaneous emission rate in the resonator in a similar way as
before in sections 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6, except that we have to replace the free space mode
density (25) by (230) which represents the resonator geometry. For a resonator tuned
near the atomic transition ω0 we obtain

It is interesting to observe what happens, when the resonator is tuned out of the reso-
nance. Note that the radiating dipole is still in the resonator, and not in free space, only
the oscillating dipole has no mode to radiate into. It can be shown that for coupling to
the oﬀ-resonance mode the decay rate can be approximated by

oﬀ-resonance:

γr ≈
Although the situation is not utterly realistic, these equations illustrate the eﬀect of en-
hanced or inhibited spontaneous emission. The equations are very crude approximations
in which we have neglected a number of things, for example that the two-level system
interacts with free modes associated with the open sides of the resonator volume. In the
following we will ﬁx some of the approximations.

4.1 Master equation of a two-level system in a resonator

As above we assume a two-level system in a resonator which exhibits suﬃciently small
dimensions so that the mode frequency separation c/2L is large compared to the charac-
teristic coupling parameters of the two-level system Ω, 1
κ ,
. In this way the two level
system interacts only with one resonator mode. Let us also assume that this resonator
ω0. In analogy to
mode is tuned to near resonance with the two-level transition: ωr ≈
section 3.6 we now identify the small system with the two-level system combined with
the resonator mode it couples to. Corresponding to this deﬁnition of the small system
we deﬁne the small system Hamiltonian Hs as

1
γr

Hs = HA + HF + HI ,

(234)

which corresponds to Htot of (176). The suitable mode set for describing the ﬁeld in a
resonator are the standing waves modes. For standing waves the coupling constant Ω
becomes a function of the position x inside the resonator, Ω(x) = Ω cos(kx) (cf. Fig. 7),
where k = ωr/c and

with ~ε denoting a unit vector in the direction of the electric ﬁeld polarization; cf. (165)
and footnote on p. 39. Transforming into a reference frame which rotates with the

and where δ = ωr −

As we have mentioned before, and illustrated in Fig. 7, the small system two-level-
system-cavity-mode is subject to two dissipative processes. The ﬁrst one consists in
the coupling with a cone of free space modes through the open sides of the resonator
structure. The second dissipative process is the loss of the standing wave resonator
mode through the mirrors to the exterior world, which is characterized by the mode
decay rate κ. Those two mechanisms are statistically independent and can therefore
be combined by a simple addition, which in a reservoir theoretical approach looks as
follows: The small system consisting of the two-level system and the single resonator
mode is coupled to two thermal reservoirs that represent the cone of electromagnetic
modes at the open resonator sides, and the mirror losses. The thermal reservoirs are
both modeled as a continuum set of harmonic oscillators. In accordance with the Born-
Markov approximation the coupling of the small system to the two reservoirs is described
by a master equation in which the dissipative (non-Hermitian) part consists of the sum
of (221) and (229), where we now have to take into account that the two-level system
only interacts with free space modes contained in a cone deﬁned by the openings in the
resonator walls. As a consequence we replace the free space spontaneous emission rate

51

γfs in (221) by the smaller rate γ′. We then can derive the small system master equation,
which is similar to (226), and which at zero temperature looks like

As next we have to identify the possible states the system can occupy. The energy
conserving part of the small system evolution consists in the exchange of quanta between
the two-level system and the resonator mode. As we found out in section 3.3, the total
number of quanta in the energy conserving process is constant – in this case here the total
number is one quantum, or excitation respectively. On the other hand, the dissipative
processes – that are the coupling-to-the-reservoir processes – are characterized by the
irreversible loss of the small system excitation.
In summary we therefore distinguish
three relevant states: two states corresponding to full excitation (one quantum states),
lo, 0

(zero quantum state). The evolution of the total quantum system takes place in the

4.2.1 Enhanced spontaneous emission

Let us imagine a completely closed resonator that surrounds the two-level system. Then
the loss mechanism which in Fig. 7 is characterized by the coeﬃcient γ′ is absent, thus
γ′ = 0. Let us also assume resonance between the two-level system and the ﬁeld mode,
so that the detuning δ = 0, and still assume weak coupling κ > Ω. Then the decay
coeﬃcient γ0 becomes maximal, γ0 = Ω2/2κ. With (195), (231), (235), and λ0 = 2πc/ω0
we obtain

We can see that γmax has the same wavelength dependence as the approximate result
(232). By taking into account the coupling of the dipole moment with the ﬁeld polariza-
tion (235) we now also obtained the correct geometrical dependence. We can see that for
λ3 a substantial enhancement

is tuned far oﬀ the two-level system resonance ω0 so that the detuning can be set to

The spontaneous emission of a two-level system in a one-mode-resonator with a large
quality factor Q can therefore be nearly completely suppressed by detuning.

We now have derived three diﬀerent rates, (195), (252), and (253), by which an excited
two-level system can decay. One might ask, how the two-level system decides which
one to choose [29, 30]. Obviously the choice depends on the electromagnetic boundary
conditions deﬁning the mode structure which surrounds the two-level system, and the
question therefore is, how does the two-level system explore its mode environment. To
answer this question we have to consider the very initial processes of the decay, which
thus involve time scales short compared to the inverse decay rate. Unfortunately this
is a range, which is not consistent with some approximations we have made in our
previous discussion, especially it is not consistent with the assumptions for using the
coarse grained derivative (212). Thus, to answer this question we need a more precise
theory. Nevertheless, let us try a qualitative argument: Let us assume the two-level

system spontaneously starts to emit, radiating a wave packet into the mode.
emission occurs into a free space mode, nothing comes back. However, if the emission
occurs into a high-Q resonator mode, then the emitted packet is reﬂected at the resonator
boundary and returns to the emitting dipole, i.e. the two-level system, where it is picked
up by the dipole. Coded in its phase, the reﬂected packet carries the information about
the geometry of the mode, as well as the state of the emitting two-level system at earlier
times. Thus, the question now is, so to speak, what the phase is of the reﬂection arriving
at the generator driving the dipole. If the reﬂection is received with a phase opposite to
the actual emitting phase, then further emission is inhibited, whereas in-phase reception
enhances the emission. We can see that a valid theory for the early emission stages must
involve the phases of the quantum systems involved. On the other side the phase is not
a Hermitian observable, therefore we must accept that the early stages of the emission
are hard to divulge.

54

4.3 Good cavity limit (strong coupling)

Strong coupling of the two-level system with the resonator mode is observed when the
photon which is emitted by the two-level system into the resonator mode lives long
enough so that it can be reabsorbed by the two-level system. In this case we have to
consider the exact solution of the system of coupled diﬀerential equations (244)–(245).
The general solution of a system of two linear, ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations is given
by the exponential ansatz

cup(t) = cup1 eα1t + cup2 eα2t ,

where the constants cup1, cup2 are chosen to ﬁt the initial conditions, for example cup(t =
0) = 1, and the exponential are given by

In this expression the imaginary part is larger than the real part, so that the time
evolution of the upper level probability Pup is characterized by oscillations at the vacuum
Rabi frequency Ω, which are slowly damped. The emission spectrum of course is no
longer a simple Lorentzian, but a doublet of Lorentzian lines, each with a width of
(γ′ + κ)/4, split by the vacuum Rabi frequency Ω [31].

4.3.1 Dressed states

We can generalize the situation if we merge the small system consisting of the two-level
system and the resonator mode into a single quantum system. As we have done before,
we associate the Hamiltonian (176) to this system.6 As we have discussed before, this
Hamiltonian H conserves the total number of small system excitations, more explicit,
. Thus in a system characterized by H

resonator mode. As a consequence, three system states had to be considered:

(cid:12)
interacts with a mode which contains several photons. In analogy to section 4.1, and
observing the approximations for the Fermi golden rule, cf.(196), we can derive the fol-
lowing result for the decay rate of a two-level system in a damped resonator, interacting

cf. (251). For ﬂuorescent dyes we can assume that the lower laser state is rapidly depop-
ulated, and that nonradiative processes, inversion saturation and collective spontaneous
emission are absent. With this assumptions the number of photons in the resonator

rate, thus

From (266) we can see that the light output n increases for any pump rate W in a linear
way, thus the laser operates without threshold. This is a phenomenon called thresholdless
lasing or lasing without inversion. This is the consequence of the exclusive coupling of
the laser active two-level systems to one single resonator mode. On the other hand,
the inversion N approaches the limit of Nt = κ/γ0 when the pump rate W increases.
This limit can be interpreted as the inversion at which the photon emission changes
its character from spontaneous emission to stimulated emission. This is the transition
which traditionally is associated with the onset of lasing. Note that this phenomenon
occurs when a collection of two-level systems interacts with a single ﬁeld mode, which is
thus diﬀerent from the interaction of only one two-level system with a single mode, i.e.
a one atom laser [33]. In summary, the conditions for inversionless lasing as expressed
in (266) and (267) are that the collection of two-level systems interacts only with a
(damped κ) single mode ﬁeld.
In particular there are no open resonator side walls
through which the two-level system can couple to the mode continuum (characterized
by γ′); cf. Fig. 7. Of course there is a continuous transition in the threshold behavior
from the open resonator case shown in Fig. 7 to the closed resonator discussed here [34]
and thresholdless lasing was observed in a dye solution placed a plane-plane resonator
in which the mirrors were spaced by half an emission wavelength [35]. In section 7 we
will discuss threshold reduction in dye loaded molecular sieve microlasers.

6 The mode structure of microresonators

6.1 The concept of dielectric constant, dielectric interfaces

Maxwell’s equations are the foundations on which both classical and quantum optics are
built. The possibility of creating a double-slit diﬀraction pattern with a single photon
- a famous manifestation of the wave-particle dualism - is a result of the fact that
photons occupy the modes of the classical electromagnetic ﬁeld, cf. the deﬁnition of the

58

bosonic operators in terms of normal modes in section 2. These modes can be discrete in
frequency, as they are in lossless closed resonators, or have a continuous spectrum as is
the case in scattering experiments such as the diﬀraction example [36]; there, the whole
information about the diﬀraction process is encoded in the modes themselves because
they must satisfy the boundary conditions on the diﬀraction slits.

Boundary conditions are a way of introducing rapid spatial variations of a medium
into the macroscopic Maxwell equations without having to give up the concept of a
dielectric constant or permittivity, by which the microscopic properties of the medium
are taken into account in a very eﬃcient mean-ﬁeld manner [37]. Even when details
of the quantum-mechanical light-matter interaction are of interest, such a mean-ﬁeld
approach is a good starting point in order to deﬁne an appropriate modal basis set in
which to expand the relevant matrix elements. This applies to dielectrics of inﬁnite
extent without losses [38] or with losses [39], but especially when ﬂuorescent or laser
emission in the presence of a microcavity are concerned.

The dielectric “constant” is moreover a function of ﬁeld strength, if the polarizabil-
ity – which describes the microscopic matter-ﬁeld interaction – depends nonlinearly on
electric ﬁeld. When such nonlinearity occurs in combination with boundary conditions,
the relative importance of the two depends on the size scales and ﬁeld strengths in-
volved. At low pump levels, phenomena such as vortex formation which has long been
known in nonlinear media [44], can cross over to linear vortices [45], an example of
which are the whispering-gallery modes which will be discussed in section 6.3. In small
cavities, boundary eﬀects become dominant, and nonlinear eﬀects can be understood as
interactions between modes of the linear cavity [45].

As we discussed above (cf. section 4), a well known microcavity eﬀect is due to Pur-
cell [24] who argued based on Fermi’s Golden Rule that the Einstein A coeﬃcient for
spontaneous emission can be enhanced in a microcavity due to its highly peaked density
of modes. For this perturbative approach to the quantum electrodynamic problem of
spontaneous emission, the modes into which photons are emitted are determined com-

the strong-coupling regime, this ceases to be correct when the radiant matter and light
ﬁeld are mixed in comparable proportion in the eigenstates of the total system, as can
in cavity polaritons in a quantum well microstructure [40], or for the Rabi
occur, e.g.
oscillations of an atom in close proximity to a dielectric microsphere [41]. Nevertheless,
the ﬁrst step in all these cases is to determine the modes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld for
the resonator goemetry at hand.

The conclusion from these preliminary remarks is that especially in microcavities, an
understanding of the eﬀects of the resonator geometry on the ﬁeld distribution, neglect-
ing nonlinearities of the medium, is of central importance. Even in the conceptually
simple problem that remains, we shall see how the well-understood fundamental equa-
tions of electrodynamics lead to solutions that are at present only partially understood,
in the sense of predicting their dependence on system parameters, or even giving con-
ditions for the existence of certain solutions – an important example again being the
whispering-gallery modes.

where the wave number is given by

k = ω/c.

Since we want to illustrate the eﬀects of boundaries, let us make the further simpliﬁcation
of considering the refractive index n to be piecewise constant, but not necessarily real.
Combining these equations, we obtain the wave equations

Since charge density can only appear at the surface of the dielectric, we have ~

The conditions to be satisﬁed at a dielectric interface are deduced from the requirement
that no current ﬂow is possible along the interface [42], implying that the tangential
components of ~E and ~H must be continuous. At vertices or edges, however, the tangent
is undeﬁned. In this case we must invoke the additional requirement that the energy
contained in any volume element of the ﬁelds should not diverge near such singularities
of the surface [42].

These conditions do not constitute true boundary conditions in the traditional sense,
but are instead matching conditions. The ﬁeld on one side of the interface is determined
by the ﬁeld on the other side, and only if we already know the latter, can the former
be obtained by solving a boundary-value problem. For some simple problems, it is in
fact easy to eliminate the ﬁeld on one side of the interface, if one knows its form a
priory. The simplest example is a plane wave in air, impinging with wavevector ~k on a
planar interface with a lossless dielectric of refractive index n. The knowledge that the
transmitted wave in the medium is again a plane wave allows us to straightforwardly
obtain Snell’s law of refraction and Fresnel’s formulas for the reﬂectivity. The latter
depend on polarization, which in this case can be chosen either perpendicular to (TE)
or in the plane of incidence (TM). With this we then can obtain decoupled scalar wave
equations. The essential diﬀerence between TE and TM polarizations is that the latter

60

exhibits the Brewster angle χB at which perfect transmission occurs. Independently of
polarization, Snell’s law relates the incident angle χ0 (which we measure with respect to
the surface normal), to the transmitted angle χ of the plane wave in the medium by

Note that for large n, transmitted waves in the dielectric are allowed to propagate only in
a progressively narrower interval around the perpendicular direction χ
0. Conversely,
the critical angle χc = arcsin(1/n) therefore deﬁnes the “escape cone” for plane waves
inside the material. Total internal reﬂection prevents all waves with χ > χc from escaping
to the optically thinner medium, i.e. the condition for conﬁnement is

6.2.2 Impedance boundary conditions

The fact that high index contrast leads to a narrow escape cone is at the heart of a large
body of literature summarized in Ref. [42]. The aim is to replace the continuity require-
ments for the ﬁelds at a dielectric interface by approximate boundary conditions called
(normal) impedance conditions. There, an approximate knowledge of the ﬁeld on the
high-index side allows one to eliminate it from the problem. Yet, the method becomes
unreliable at low refractive-index contrast and at non-planar interfaces; in particular, the
Brewster eﬀect is not correctly reproduced unless additional corrections are introduced
which, however, do not permit a simple physical interpretation, because they involve
derivatives of the ﬁelds that are of higher order than the original continuity conditions
for the ﬁelds themselves. We shall therefore make no use of impedance boundary condi-
tions, except to point out that they reduce to the familiar Dirichlet boundary conditions
(vanishing ﬁelds on the surface) if the index contrast becomes inﬁnite, as would be the
case in an ideal metal.

6.3 Scattering resonances versus cavity modes in the dielectric

cylinder

One way to probe the interaction of dielectric bodies with light is by elastic scattering.
Atmospheric phenomena such as the rainbow, the halo, or the glory arise from light
scattering [43], and in fact atmospheric science relies on scattering experiments as diag-
nostic tools. When scattering experiments are carried out with high spectral resolution,
a ripple structure is observed in scattering cross sections, which cannot be understood
in a purely ray-optics framework. These ripples are resonances which occur when the
incident light couples to long-lived cavity modes. In order to illustrate the relationship
between resonances and modes, we consider here the example of a dielectric rod with a
circular cross section.

Dielectric cylinders are of great practical interest because they are the archetypical
model for an optical ﬁber. In the context of this review, the approximate cylindrical

symmetry of the molecular sieve microcrystals makes it desirable to establish some
fundamentals of cylindrical systems. The modes of an optical ﬁber can be divided
into two classes: guiding modes and “leaky” modes. As is well known, guided modes are
responsible for the ability of silica ﬁbers to carry long-distance communication signals,
corresponding in the ray picture to zigzagging trajectories traversing the ﬁber core in an
almost planar motion – the plane of propagation coincides with the cylinder axis. The
conﬁnement mechanism in the ray picture is total internal reﬂection at the interface to a
lower-index medium, either the cladding of the ﬁber or – as we will assume for simplicity –
the abrupt interface with air. However, over short distances a signiﬁcant power transport
can take place through the leaky modes as well, which must be taken into account in
It is also known [49] that
any comprehensive treatment of optical waveguides [49].
one has to distinguish between tunneling leaky modes which are conﬁned by frustrated
total internal reﬂection, and refracting leaky modes whose attenuation is even larger
because they correspond to rays that violate the condition for total internal reﬂection.
Leaky modes correspond to rays spiraling down the ﬁber in a helical trajectory, and are
therefore also called “spiral modes” [50].

Of these three types of modes – guided, tunneling, and refracting – for propagation
along a ﬁber, only the leaky ones remain if the radiation is incident with propagation
vector perpendicular to the ﬁber axis. This is the situation we shall focus on, because
the applications we have in mind are not intended for power transport but for power
storage, i.e. resonators. The corresponding ray trajectories are then conﬁned to a plane
in which they perform a circulating motion. An example where this mode structure
has in fact been observed directly is a laterally structured cylindrical VCSEL [51] where
such a mode supports lasing action at an unexpectedly low pump power. Because the
circulating mode structure is analogous to the acoustic “whispering-gallery” phenomenon
in which sound waves cling to the curved walls of certain buildings, modes with a ring-
shaped intensity distribution are commonly termed “whispering-gallery (WG) modes”.
The range of material parameters relevant to the design of dielectric resonator struc-
tures is increasing continuously, as novel materials enter device applications. For glasses,
refractive indices between n
1.4 and 2 are available (glass for application in ﬁber am-
pliﬁers has n
1.8). Semiconductor materials extend this interval to even larger indices,
while organic compounds border on the lower end of the index range. The fundamental
wave equations for elastic light scattering in the case of no propagation along the axis of
the dielectric cylinder are much simpler than for arbitrary oblique incidence, and conse-
quently treatments of plane wave scattering from dielectric cylinders at normal incidence
can be found in many textbooks [46, 47, 48]. Because of the ever increasing range of
applications, we review them here, emphasizing, however, what in the literature is usu-
ally missing, namely the aspect of the relation between resonances and cavity modes.
One important piece of notation that we introduce here is conspicuously absent from
the classic texts: the formulation of the light scattering problem in terms of S-matrix
theory, as it is used in quantum mechanical scattering. Investigations of leaky cavities
may well proﬁt from a more uniﬁed scattering-theoretical terminology.

6.3.1 Metastable well in the eﬀective potential

To understand the origin of long-lived whispering gallery mode resonances we examine
Maxwell’s equations for an inﬁnite dielectric cylinder. Following an argument used by
Johnson [53] for the dielectric sphere, we can rewrite (273) in a form similar to the
Schr¨odinger equation of quantum mechanics,

2 ~E + k2(1

n2) ~E = k2 ~E .

(276)

−
This shows that dielectric regions (n > 1) correspond to an attractive potential well in
the quantum analogy, except that here the potential is itself multiplied by the eigenvalue
k2.

−∇

The reason why extremely long-lived resonances are created when the scatterer has
rotational symmetry is that after separation of variables in cylindrical or spherical coor-
dinates, (276) gives rise to a radial equation with a repulsive potential term due to the
angular momentum barrier, as well as the attractive term just noted. For the case of a
dielectric cylinder studied here the resulting equation reads

The additional centrifugal potential term has appeared as a consequence of conservation

propagation perpendicular to the z-axis of the cylinder, so that kz = 0, and the inci-
y plane. The problem then becomes eﬀectively

The radial “potential” which results from the sum of the attractive well due to the
dielectric and the repulsive angular momentum barrier is shown in Fig. 10, cf. also Ref.
[54]. At nonzero angular momentum one sees that a metastable well is formed within the
dielectric. The electric ﬁeld inside is separated from the propagating ﬁeld outside by a
tunnel barrier, and one may expect solutions of the wave equation in which the intensity
inside the well is exponentially larger than outside the well. In order to complete the
formal analogy to the one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation we make a substitution of
variables to eliminate the ﬁrst derivative term in the radial equation (277). This can be
achieved by introducing a new coordinate ξ := ln(kr); the resulting equation is

that q is real for some value of r within the dielectric. The largest value of the argument
of the square root within the dielectric occurs when r = R, so we deduce the condition

On the other hand, if inﬁnitesimally outside the dielectric where n = 1, q is real, then
there is no region of exponential decay, and no sharp resonances exist. The maximum
value of k such that q is imaginary just outside the dielectric is given by

Consequently, we expect narrow resonances of angular momentum m, broadened only
by tunnelling decay (evanescent leakage), for wave vectors satisfying

We will label these metastable well states by a discrete index ν which corresponds to
the number of radial nodes. If the refractive index is changed, the barrier top in Fig. 10
remains the same, but the well grows deeper so that the lowest allowed k will give rise
to a narrower resonance. Later we will show that essentially all of the metastable states
satisfying (282) are discrete in the sense that their spacing in k is larger than their decay
width through the barrier. In this way they will give rise to isolated resonances in the
scattering functions which are well set apart from the background.

(283)

It is worth quoting here the main features of the numerically observed resonances in
plane-wave scattering oﬀ a dielectric cylinder at normal incidence, as given in Ref. [48]
(but using our notation):

[radial node number], and their widths increase as ν increases for a given
m. Also, as the index of refraction [n] is increased, the positions of the
resonances shift to lower kR, and their widths become narrower. Resonances
having relatively narrow widths occur in the range x to n x.

All of the above phenomena can already be understood qualitatively by inspecting the
eﬀective potential picture.

The inequality (283) can be brought into a very suggestive form which can be justiﬁed

by considering the short-wavelength limit in the WKB approximation [54]:

then (283) leads to

(284)

×

The right inequality is trivial, but the left relation is precisely the condition for
total
internal reﬂection which must be satisﬁed by the angle of incidence χ on the high-index
side at an interface to air, cf. (275). At this point we have provided no reason why χ,
as deﬁned here, should be the classical angle of incidence. Let us try a non-rigorous
argument:
If we interpret the ray trajectories as classical particles with momentum
~(nk) inside the resonator, and angular momentum L = ~m, then the classical relation
between angular and linear momentum would imply ~L = ~r
~p ; L = R (~nk) sin χ ;
m = R nk sin χ, where sin χ arises from the vector product of linear momentum and
radius vector r, which in turn has magnitude R at every reﬂection from the boundary.
At such a reﬂection, χ is then just the angle of incidence.

The introduction of ~ into the present optical context is somewhat arbitrary. The
question is, does the optical ﬁeld in the cavity truly acquire angular momentum. We
know that photons, as massless fundamental particles, carry a unit spin angular mo-
mentum, but no orbital angular momentum in the physical sense. Therefore, when we
refer to m as an angular momentum quantum number, we invoke a formal analogy that
arises between the mathematical structure of bound photonic states and bound quan-
tum systems: There are, in our case, two degrees of freedom which are associated with a
ﬁnite region of space, giving rise to a discrete frequency spectrum. The modes are then
labeled by as many discrete indices, or “quantum” numbers as there are conﬁned degrees
of freedom. For a rotationally symmetric problem, the indices, or quantum numbers, are
simply the number of radial and azimuthal nodes of the wave function. The azimuthal
quantum number is what we call m. Its relation to the angle of incidence is rigorously
derivable from the eikonal (or WKB) limit [54].

There is an additional complication to this argument if the cavity is not closed. Due
to the openness of the system, it is then not clear how to deﬁne the photons in a resonant
mode. However, the cavity can approach the closed limit as n
. Before we discuss
this problem, we will elucidate the concept of modes in the leaky cavity setting, where
discrete resonances appear but have a ﬁnite width in k. We will return to this issue
under the heading of quasibound states in section 6.4.

For this moment let us nevertheless dwell on (285), which we can use to interpret
some results. For example, it indicates that states at the bottom of the well correspond
to a ray motion tangential to the boundary, whereas states at the top correspond to
rays colliding with the boundary at exactly the critical angle. As next we turn to a
more detailed discussion of the actual wave solutions for the dielectric cylinder where
the incident wave propagation is normal to the axis.

6.3.2 Matching conditions for TM polarization

Our general considerations so far have not addressed the boundary conditions at the
interface between dielectric and vacuum (or air) – conditions which also depend on the
polarization of ~E. The arguments given above for the existence of narrow resonances
are, however, independent of the boundary conditions, because we rely only on the
fact that a tunnel barrier is formed where the ﬁeld decays. Thus there should exist
resonances corresponding to two diﬀerent polarization states. Henceforth we will focus
on the transverse magnetic polarization for which the boundary conditions lead to the
simplest matching conditions for the electric ﬁeld inside and outside the dielectric. For
this polarization state we assume an incident plane wave of the form ~E = E(x, y) ~ez,
where the unit vector ~ez points parallel to the cylinder axis (and hence the magnetic
ﬁeld is transverse to the cylinder axis). From now on we will focus on the scalar function
E(x, y) = E(r, φ) which is the amplitude of the electric ﬁeld in z-direction. Since a pure
dielectric is an insulator, there is no current ﬂowing on its surface in response to the
incident ﬁeld and ~H is continuous everywhere (neglecting any variation in the magnetic
permeability). From (268), we derive the azimuthal component of the magnetic ﬁeld,
which in polar coordinates has the form

Hφ =

[
∇ ×

E~ez]φ =

i
k

i
k

∂E
∂r

−

.

(286)

Therefore the radial derivative of E(r, φ) is continuous at the dielectric surface. Since
the tangential component of E is always continuous at such an interface, we arrive at
the simple matching conditions that both E and ∂E/∂r are continuous at the cylinder
surface. TE polarization ( ~H along ~ez) does not result in these familiar requirements
[46, 47], however one can still obtain a scalar wave equation, which can be treated with
a generalization of the methods used below. Most conveniently, one writes the wave
equation for the magnetic ﬁeld H, which is again continuous, but exhibits a jump of
magnitude n2 in the normal derivative at the interface. The eﬀective potential picture
with purely tunneling escape for the whispering gallery modes remains unchanged by
this, since our arguments above did not involve polarization. Note that for TE polar-
ization the electric ﬁeld is in the plane of incidence. Transmission out of the dielectric
becomes unity at the Brewster angle which neglecting the ﬁnite curvature of the interface
is given by

sin χB =

1
√1 + n2

.

(287)

66

The whispering gallery mode criterion sin χ > 1/n is clearly not modiﬁed by this eﬀect
since sin χB < 1/n.

An important point is that the same matching conditions remain valid even when
the cross section of the cylinder is non-circular, because for TM polarization ~E remains
tangential to the surface. As long as we consider only convex surfaces, the continuity of
∂E/∂r in polar coordinates implies the continuity of the normal derivative of E. These
boundary conditions are identical to those for quantum scattering from a potential well.
Hence, we are allowed to use the terms familiar from quantum theory, such as tunneling,
as we did in the previous sections. However, as was already noted with (276), it should be
kept in mind that the analogy is incomplete, because the dispersion relation in quantum
mechanics is ω = ~ k2/(2m) and not ω = n c k as in optics. The results presented here can
therefore not be obtained by simply copying known quantum mechanical calculations.
An important diﬀerence between the quantum and optical wave equations can be read
oﬀ (278), where the eﬀective potential well is seen to become progressively deeper with
increasing k. As a consequence, above barrier reﬂection remains signiﬁcant even for
large k, whereas it would become negligible in an attractive circular quantum well at
high energies. This eﬀect is just the well known classical Fresnel reﬂection at a dielectric
n)2/(1 + n)2 at
interface, which independently of the wavelength has the value R = (1
normal incidence, i.e. sin χ = m/(nkR)

6.3.3 Resonances in elastic scattering

The wave equation for TM (or TE) polarization as deﬁned above is of the scalar form

2ψ + n2k2 ψ = 0 ,

∇

where ψ denotes the electric ﬁeld for the TM case, and the refractive index n is a constant
diﬀerent from 1 inside the dielectric. The wavenumber k is not position dependent
because it enters the problem simply through the deﬁnition ω = c k for the harmonic
time dependence. All the scattering functions for the elastic scattering of light (i.e.
scattering at the ﬁxed frequency ω) by a dielectric cylinder can be calculated if we know

angular momentum states m. Using these solutions, one can for example calculate the

This unitarity relation also holds for deformed resonators, where S is not diagonal. It

For numerical calcultions borrowing this formalism from quantum-mechanics is therefore
an added advantage.

explicit formula for the scattering intensity I(φ), an example of which is plotted in Fig.
11. As is seen in the ﬁgure, the scattered intensity shows rapid resonant variations.
The resonances are not simply Lorentzian peaks, but are of the Fano shape [56] with
varying values of the Fano asymmetry parameter. This asymmetric shape is due to
interference between the nonresonant scattered waves and the resonant scattering. As
long as the resonance is suﬃciently isolated the resonance widths can be extracted by

resonances have widely varying widths corresponding to how close they are to the top

n = 2 at φ = 50◦ with respect to the direction of the incoming wave which is

The decomposition (297) is analogous to the case of a scattering sphere [53], and in
the same way one observes that intensity maxima occur near the value of k at which
one of the bm has a maximum (if there is no interference with other nonresonant waves
then it will be at exactly that value of k). This in turn occurs when βm = 0. Thus, we
set (298) to zero and obtain an implicit equation for the resonance positions x = kR in
each angular momentum channel m:

Above-barrier resonances thus occur if either (300) or (301) is satisﬁed. Yet, these
resonances will typically be so broad that they do not give rise to isolated peaks in the
scattering functions.

6.3.4 Quasibound states at complex wavenumber

Having obtained the condition for when a resonance is excited in elastic scattering, we
now turn to a complementary approach in which no incident wave is present. Resonances
can also be excited without any incoming wave at that frequency, e.g. if the light is
generated inside, such as in a laser. Also the speciﬁc lineshape of a resonance in elastic
scattering depends on the nature of the incident wave and is not a property of the
scatterer alone. It is thus useful and important to consider an alternative deﬁnition of
the resonant state which is independent of the manner of its excitation. We will ﬁrst
introduce the concept of the quasibound state. We will discuss this concept using the
example of the dielectric cylinder we have have considered above, and then turn to the
more general signiﬁcance of such states.

Solutions of the wave equation with no incoming wave are termed quasibound states
(or in the recent literature on resonances of dielectric spheres, quasinormal modes [57],
hinting at the fact that they are not an orthonormal set in the usual sense). Due to
the unitarity of the S-matrix for real k, there can be no such solutions for real values
of k. Instead quasibound states are directly connected with the complex poles of the
S-matrix (or in our simple case the matrix element Sm), the real part of k giving the
resonance frequency, and the imaginary part giving the resonance width. This is because
the condition for having a solution to the matching equations with no incoming wave is
just the condition for a pole of the S-matrix [58]: If in (289) we give the incoming wave
(H (2)

m an arbitrary amplitude Ai, then the outgoing wave will have amplitude

Ao = Sm Ai .

(302)

If we now set Ai →
has a divergence, requiring us to tune k to the complex value where Sm has a pole.

0, there can be a ﬁnite outgoing radiation if at the same time Sm

Thus the complex wavenumber of the quasi-bound state is determined by

˜Em(r) =

˜Sm H (1)
m (kr)

(

and the accompanying condition for continuity of the derivatives. These matching con-
ditions for ˜E can be satisﬁed only for a discrete set of complex k at which there exists a
nontrivial solution to the homogenous part of the linear system (290). The latter occurs
only at the zeroes of the determinant

This can be solved numerically to ﬁnd the real and imaginary parts of kR at which a
metastable state occurs. Equation (307) is a complex equation for a complex variable. If
we restrict kR to be real, then the real and imaginary parts of the equation are precisely
(300) and (301) which we obtained for the scattering resonances. This shows the direct
relationship between the quasibound states and the scattering resonances: For real kR,
(307) cannot be exactly fulﬁlled, but the closest one can get to satisfying it with real
kR is given by the scattering resonance conditions.

The exact results obtained numerically for the real parts of the quasibound state
wavevectors are summarized in Fig. 12. For each m, there exists an inﬁnite sequence of
discrete points in this grid, corresponding to an increasing number of radial nodes in the
eﬀective potential well. The quasibound states are hence labeled by angular momentum
and radial quantum numbers (which we call m and ν), as in the closed circle. We have
drawn in Fig. 12 a line of slope m/kR = 1 corresponding to the condition sin χ = 1
n;
resonances to the right of that line are true whispering gallery modes and we expect
their widths to be much less than the resonance spacing, with the narrowest resonances
corresonding to the points with the largest distance from this line.

Figure 12: Resonance positions in the circle of refractive index n = 2 with TM polariza-
tion for the lowest 44 angular momentum numbers m. Each dot corresponds
to one resonance, and the solid line kR = m represents the dividing line be-
tween broad and narrow resonances, with narrow widths expected below it.
The horizontal dashed lines enclose a kR interval in which we count a total of
9 resonances below the critical line. Compare this observation with the scat-
tered intensity in Fig. 11. The three narrowest resonances there correspond
to the three lowest kR points at m = 17, 18, 19. The closer the points are to
the critical line, the broader the resonances get.

Note that the spacing in k of resonances for a given value of m is roughly constant
above the line m/kR = 1, whereas the spacing of resonances below the line increases

71

and hence is not independent of kR for a given m. The latter are the whispering gallery
mode resonances of primary interest to us.

The uniform spacing of the above barrier resonances can be demonstrated by using
the large argument expansions of the Bessel functions in (307). This is justiﬁed at large
enough size parameter nkR

m, noting that nkR > m always holds. One obtains

closed system with Neumann boundary conditions, J ′m(kR) = 0, in the limit nkR
m,
and it clearly leads to a purely real kR, i.e. to truly bound states.

≫

On the other hand large n is not always necessary to get an approximate result: one
obtains the same expression for the resonance position independently of n, provided the
quotient of the Hankel functions is purely imaginary. This is precisely the case for above-
barrier resonances, where kR > m, and hence we can use the large argument expansion
i/n,
for the Hankel functions, too. The righthand side in (309) then becomes equal to

Of greatest interest to us, however, are the long-lived resonances with kR > m. For
this case, the ratio of Hankel functions will acquire an m- and k-dependent real and
imaginary part, which will emerge in both resonance positions and widths. Approximate
explicit expressions for resonance widths and positions can be obtained, but are not
generally valid for the entire range of interesting parameters n, kR, m [55] – therefore,
we can for now be content with the simple limiting cases considered here. They are
already of practical use because a numerical solution of the implicit equation (307) for
the real and imaginary part of k at given m and n is made more eﬃcient by using the
approximate resonance positions from (312) as an initial guess in ﬁnding the roots of
(307).

6.4 Quasibound states in lasing and ﬂuorescence

The previous considerations have brought us to the quasibound state concept via the
resonances in elastic light scattering. Even if we allow the cross section of our dielectric
cylinder to be deformed, TE and TM polarization can still be decoupled (see the remarks
in section 6.3.2), provided we continue to restrict ourselves to propagation normal to the
cylinder axis. After we clariﬁed the role a complex wavenumber k can play in the
original wave equation, we deduce a rather general statement about quasibound states.
To arrive at the time-independent wave equation (273), we assumed a monochromatic
ickt, with k = ω/c according to (270). With the quasibound state
time variation e−
boundary condition (no incoming wave), this same wave equation admits solutions only
at discrete complex k = ω/c
i γ/c, where we have split the frequency into its real and
imaginay part. Returning to the ansatz for the time dependence, this implies that the
iω t
quasibound state decays in time as exp[

γ t].

−

This decay is of course a consequence that the system is open and radiates energy
away to inﬁnity. Consequently, the corresponding “radiation boundary condition” is
composed only of outgoing waves which are present far away from the cavity. This is
the type of boundary condition that occurs in many emission problems, in particular in
lasing. To see how these “leaky modes”, which we found in the treatment of the passive
cavity, arise in lasing, we have to take a new point of view: Consider a scalar wave
equation of the form

−

−

2ψ + ˜n2k2 ψ = 0,

∇

(314)

as it arises for each of the coupled polarization directions in the cylinder. This is similar
to (273) where we made the ansatz of a steady-state time dependence with real k. If we
do indeed require k to be real, then in order to ﬁnd a solution satisfying the radiation
condition, we permit the refractive index to be complex inside the resonator, which we
denote by ˜n = n
i n′, where n is the real part. The imaginary part allows to introduce
an amplifying medium. Consider the simple example of a plane wave exp[i˜nkx] which
will clearly grow with x in the direction of propagation. This is the “energy source”, but
note that the detailed mechanism of this energy production, for example the pumping
mechanism, is not deﬁned in this way. Nevertheless, outside the cavity, we again assume
air with ˜n = 1 with matching conditions that are appropriate for the given polarization.

−

73

Finally, let us assume TM polarization as before in the scattering problem. The solutions
for the exterior and interior ﬁeld are ψext and ψint.

Let us now recast (314) as

2ψ + n2˜k2 ψ = 0 ,

∇

(315)

where n is the real part of ˜n as deﬁned above, and ˜k = k
i k n′/n is the complex
wavenumber inside the cavity, which reduces to ˜k = k outside. This recast equation is
almost of the form of (288), except that k has diﬀerent values inside and outside the

equation at complex k) if the deacy rate was deﬁned as as

If instead, we also had ˜k = k

−

−

γ = ck n′/n.

(316)

We now may argue that adding or dropping the imaginary part of ˜k outside the resonator
makes only a small diﬀerence if γ is small:
In fact, as can be checked (cf. [55]) by
inspecting the large-argument asymptotics of the Hankel function H (2), the ﬁeld of a
c/(2γ) from the cavity grows exponentially
quasibound state at distances larger than
due to retardation, but within this physical range ψext vanishes as γ
0. Therefore
one can write ψext(r)
γζ(r). If we expand ψint(γ) and ζ(γ) in a Taylor series in γ,
then to linear order the γ-dependence of ζ, but not that of ψint, can be dropped in the
full solution. Therefore, the stationary state of the active medium described by (314))
or (315), as well as the metastable decaying state obtained by replacing the real valued
outside wavenumber k by k
i k n′/n are identical to ﬁrst order in γ within an area of
order γ−

2.

In conclusion, we have seen that long-lived quasibound states appear not only as
resonances in elastic light scattering but also as stationary states in emission problems
at low pump rate (characterized by γ = ck n′/n). When asking for the intrinsic properties
of such long-lived states, it is often a good starting point to consider ﬁrst the limiting case
of no losses, i.e. the closed cavity. In the next section, we discuss the familiar concept
of Gaussian beams as freely propagating waves, and how they can be used to describe
resonator modes. Although since the work of Fox and Lee [62] this is the standard
approach to describe laser resonators [28], this approach has some severe limitations for
microresonators.

6.5 Paraxial approximation and the parabolic equation

In free space, the spectrum of electromagnetic waves is not only continuous but highly de-
generate, as can be seen, for example, by choosing plane-wave solutions of the Helmholtz
equation and noting that at each frequency an inﬁnite number of propagation direc-
tions can be chosen. There exists a class of approximate free space solutions of the
Helmholtz equation, the Gaussian beams. Gaussian beams are obtained by introduc-
ing the slowly-varying envelope approximation in the wave equation. This is a special
case of a frequently encountered approximation which is labelled with diﬀerent names,

74

for example adiabatic approximation, paraxial approximation, or Born-Oppenheimer
approximation. In the theory of partial diﬀerential equations one also ﬁnds the name
“parabolic-equation” method, because the main step is to neglect the second derivative
of a slowly-varying “envelope” function, which results in an equation of the type of the
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for the latter. In optics, this approximation leads
to the Fresnel propagator describing diﬀraction in the limit of small angles with the
optical axis.

6.5.1 Gaussian beams and the short-wavelength limit

Gaussian beams play a prominent role in traditional laser optics, because they arise
naturally as solutions in parallel-mirror resonator structures, and they also represent
diﬀraction-limited propagation. However, they are not in general acceptable functions
to describe the modes of a microcavity. In contrast to free space, it is not even clear a
priori how to deﬁne the equivalent of the paraxial condition in a general microresonator
structure, such as for example a circular disk. To clarify this point, we will discuss the
paraxial approximation as next.

Behind the paraxial approximation is the picture of a “light beam” propagating in

z-direction. Let us assume that the beam is described by the envelope function

which we insert into the Helmholtz equation

As aresult we obtain

ψ(x, y, z)

u(x, y; z) eikz

≡

2ψ + k2ψ = 0 .

∇

uxx + uyy + uzz + 2i kuz = 0 .

With this step we have formally reduced the wavenumber exponent by one, without loss
of information.

In the paraxial approximation we take (319), but neglect the second order derivative
∂2u/∂z2. In what situation is this appropriate? The name “paraxial” comes from
uzz ≡
a comparison between length scales over which wave solution extends along z and in the
transverse directions, respectively. Let L be the relevant length in the z direction. Now
let us introduce rescaled coordinates which measure the transverse space in dimensionless
form as [59]

while for the longitudinal dimension we set

This equation is mathematically of a fundamentally diﬀerent type than the Helmholtz
equation: whereas the former is an elliptic partial diﬀerential equation, the latter is
parabolic. The diﬀerence is that solutions of an elliptic equation are determined by
solving a boundary-value problem, while solutions of (324) are speciﬁed by initial con-
ditions along a line z = z0, for example. If we try to impose boundary conditions on
(324) by specifying the values of u on a closed surface in x, y, z (e.g. a microresonator),
there will in general be no solution for any k, whereas the original eigenvalue problem
(318) always exhibits solutions satisfying the boundary conditions for a discrete set of
k-values. This well-known consequence of the theory of characteristcs [61] by which
second-order partial diﬀerential equations are classiﬁed explains why paraxial approxi-
mations in general do not allow to ﬁnd all the modes of a resonator.

Let us put it in other words: Equation (324) is formally analogous to the time-
m/~. We know
dependent Schr¨odinger equation in which we substitute z
that this equation uniquely determines the time evolution of any initial wave packet
prepared at time t = t0. This corresponds to specifying the solution of (324) at some
z = z0. Clearly, if in addition to the initial condition we also want to impose an arbitrary
“ﬁnal distribution” of u at some other time t = t1, then, in general, a contradiction will
arise to the unique time evolution. Only for special choices of initial distributions can
the ﬁnal condition be met. Boundary conditions on a closed surface in the “spacetime”
spanned by x, y, z are therefore not generally consistent with (324). Now, based on this
parabolic equation how can we ﬁnd the modes of a closed resonator?

6.6 Gaussian beams in free space

There are various schemes by which this can be accomplished for some subset of modes,
and the vast majority of conventional resonator calculations in optics are based on such
methods [28]. In order to discuss these approaches and their limitations for microcavities,
we ﬁrst recall how the propagation along z (or the “time evolution”) can be expressed
in terms of the retarded Green function G:

u(x′, y′; z′) =

G(x′, y′, z′; x, y, z0) u(x, y; z0) dx dy .

The Green function of the free particle time dependent Schr¨odinger equation, also called
its propagator [60], is well known from quantum mechanics [14] as well as from the
theory of thermal conduction [61] (where it appears with an imaginary time scale):

Here, d = 1, 2, 3 is the number of spatial dimensions. This result reminds us of an-
other important feature of the parabolic equation: The above function describes how
a wavepacket localized at a single point ~r at time t spreads with time. Such pulse
spreading is completely absent in the time dependent Green function of Maxwell’s wave

The discussion in quantum mechanics textbooks usually applies to three space dimen-
sions (d = 3). However, we require the analogous objects for the case of two spatial
dimensions (d = 2) – in the paraxial approximation, z takes the role of a time param-
eter and hence leaves only x and y as spatial coordinates. The reduced dimensionality
introduces diﬀerent prefactors in Green’s function but leaves the basic implications of
the paraxial approximation (including pulse spreading) unchanged. With d = 2, (325)
describes the transverse proﬁle of a paraxial beam, as it propagates along the z axis.
The equation is identical to the Fresnel wave propagation formula [63] for the ﬁeld ψ, if
we use the deﬁnition of u in (317).

The Green function in 325, alias the Fresnel propagation kernel, deﬁnes an integral
equation for the transverse mode functions u(x, y), which is a frequent starting point
for determining resonator modes in the paraxial approximation. Before we turn to the
problem of resonator modes, it is useful to consider ﬁrst the eigenfunctions of (325) in
free space which are called Gaussian beams. The derivation of the fundamental Gaussian
beam proﬁle follows the analogy between (324) and the time dependent Shr¨odinger
equation. An important solution is the minumum-uncertainty wavepacket,

u(x, z) =

where σ is the width of the wavepacket in x direction at “time” z = 0. An analogous form
can be found for the other transverse direction, y, and the full wave function requires
taking the product of both proﬁles. This separability is a consequence of the fact that we
have imposed no boundary conditions on the free-space propagation. We can therefore
restrict ourselves without loss of generality to wave functions that depend only on one
transverse coordinate (x) for now.

Note that (327) is a special minimum uncertainty wavepacket with zero average x-
momentum. By the uncertainty relation, σ is related to to the spread in wavenumber
kx through

σ ∆kx = 1/2 .
The wavepacket therefore has a nonzero width ∆kx in Fourier space, which will lead to
divergence as a function of “time” z. By decomposing prefactor and exponent into their

(328)

77

real and imaginary parts, it is straightforward to show that (327) describes a standard
Gaussian beam [64], if we reinstate the deﬁnition ψ = u exp(ikz) and interpret 2 σ as
the minumum spot size at z = 0. The divergence, or angular beam spread, is given by

θ = arctan

1
k σ

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(329)

It must be emphasized that the Gaussian beam is not an exact solution of the free-space
Helmholtz equation (318), but becomes exact only in the paraxial limit. The beam
spreading is, however, not an artefact of this parabolic equation method. It correctly
describes the conjugate relation between spot size and transverse wavenumber which is
a consequence of diﬀraction.

6.7 Gauss-Hermite beams

The spot size 2 σ is a parameter at our disposal, by which we can determine the relative
uncertainties in position and momentum according to (328). This freedom is important
when one attempts to construct approximate resonator modes by properly adjusting
Gaussian beams, as we will see below. Further generalizations of the fundamental Gaus-
sian beam are possible in free space, by allowing the transverse amplitude to vary. An
important special case are the Gauss-Hermite beams which are constructed as follows.
If we set z = 0 in (327), then the resulting instantaneous Gaussian

The solutions are products of Hermite polynomials and the Gaussian u0. From this
construction at z = 0, however, it is not directly obvious how the beam shape changes
as it propagates along z. To see this we will deﬁne a generalized creation operator
c† which properly describes the spreading (divergence) of the beam, and which, when
applied to the z-dependent u(x, z) of (327), generates functions which are solutions of
the parabolic equation (324).

For propagation in the x

z plane to which we restricted our attention, the transverse
beam coordinate is x, whereas z is the propagation direction playing the role of a time
variable. Let us deﬁne the following dimensionless quantities

which in the limit z = 0 reduces to (333) because then q =

that (338) and (339) lead to the correct commutation relation [c, c†] = 1, as a direct
consequence of the fact that the quantities deﬁned in (336) satisfy the relation

for all z. We included complex conjugation of p even though it is real, in order to
highlight the similarity to the quantum commutation relation between conjugate oper-
ators – and indeed, p can be interpreted formally as the conjugate momentum of the
complex trajectory q(kz) because it satisﬁes the equation of motion p = dq/d(kz) with
dimensionless time kz.

For c† generating Gauss-Hermite beams, this operator must exhibit two additional

qualities which we check in the following.

•

•

First, we verify by direct application of (339) that c annihilates the fundamental
beam u(x, z) given in (327).

Second, we verify that (c†)m u(x, z) with m = 1, 2 . . . is again a solution of the
free-space parabolic equation (324).

This result means that if u is a solution with L u = 0, then c†u is also a solution, because

L(c†u) = c†(L u) = 0.

Thus, we have shown that the set of Gauss-Hermite beams are solutions of the free space
wave equation in paraxial approximation.

6.8 Resonator modes in the parabolic equation approximation

The construction of resonator modes using the results obtained so far requires us ﬁrst to
identify what is meant by the z axis along which the beams propagate, if the system is
bounded by some surface. For simplicity, we ﬁrst assume that this boundary is perfectly
reﬂecting, what corresponds to Dirichlet boundary conditions. We can approach this
situation from two logically distinct directions.

Traditionally it is assumed that the mirrors are shaped such that they precisely match
the wavefronts of a Gaussian beam for some value of spot size σ and wavenumber k.
On the other logical side one can start with a desired ﬁeld conﬁguration for which the
shape of suitable mirrors is sought. The goal is to ﬁnd modes with a predeﬁned form
which is optimally adapted to a given practical problem. In contrast to the traditional
approach this procedure has the form of an inverse boundary-value problem. It has been
addressed in Ref. [65], and plays a role whenever beams have to be matched to a given
situation.

The molecular sieve crystals on which this review focuses, as well as all other self-
assembled realizations of dielectric microresonators such as aerosol or polymer droplets,
pose instead a well deﬁned boundary value problem with little or no freedom of adjusting
the cavity shape. This forces us to take a diﬀerent route if we wish to extend the results
of the previous subsections.

The application of the parabolic equation method in the diﬀraction theory of res-
onators is presented in great detail in Ref. [59], where, however, the salient features are

80

at times obscured by the mathematical apparatus that is necessary to treat wave prop-
agation in three dimensions with inhomogenous refractive index. In the folloeing we do
not take such complications into account, but approach the solution of the Helmholtz
equation (318) with only x and z as variables, and Dirichlet boundary conditions on the
cavity wall which in view of the situation with microresonators, we assume to be a two
dimensional closed surface. The idea of this approach is that since the Gaussian beam
is an approximate short wavelength solution near some z axis, we can piece together
a resonator mode by using Gaussian beams which follow a closed ray trajectory in the
cavity. An example for such a closed orbit is shown in Fig. 13. It is a nontrivial example
where a ray based mode analysis of the present type leads to accurate results [67]. Each

Figure 13: (a) A stable periodic orbit in an oval cavity. The path can be parametrized
by the arc length s, i.e. the longitudinal distance along the ray from the
(arbitrary) starting point A. reﬂections occur at lengths sk. The stability of
this bow tie shaped pattern is apparent in (b) where a ray is launched with
initial position and direction slightly oﬀ the periodic path: the trajectory is
nevertheless conﬁned to the vicinity of the bow tie, performing an oscillation
transverse to the trajectory in (a). The transverse deviation in position can be
measured by a coordinate q as shown in (c), and likewise p denotes a deviation
in momentum (or direction) of the initial ray. The outcome of the reﬂection
for such a perturbed ray is shown dashed. Deviations are exaggerated for
clarity.

straight segment of the trajectory between two successive reﬂections deﬁnes a z axis for
which the analysis of the previous subsections can be carried out. Assuming a solution
of the form 337 in each segment, we determine p and q in a generalization of (336)
such that two requirements are satisﬁed: The boundary conditions must be met to the
accuracy of the paraxial approximation, and the full solution must be single valued (i.e.
reproduce itself) after a complete round trip around the ray orbit (constructive inter-
ference condition). We retain the form given in (336), with one modiﬁcation. Without
modiﬁcation, the minimum width of the Gaussian beam is located always at z = 0. We
can shift this location by allowing p to be complex, and still maintaining the relation

p q∗ = i underlying the construction of the Gauss-Hermite modes. Thus we deﬁne

−

p
q(kz)

≡
≡

A1 ,
A1 kz + A0 ,

(345)

where A0,1 are complex but restricted to Re(A0 A1) = 0.

To follow the wave around the closed trajectory, we introduce a new longitudinal
coordinate s which measures the distance along the whole ray loop from some arbitrary
starting point, say point A in Fig. 13. Then the individual reﬂections occur after the
lengths sk, k = 1, . . . N, where N is the number of bounces. Furthermore, let L be
the length of the close path.
In order for the wave function to be single-valued, the
parameter q governing the spreading in the transverse wave function must be periodic
as a function of s with period L, for example

q(s + L) = q(s)

(346)

for all s in the interval of straight propagation we consider.

6.9 Monodromy matrix

From the boundary condition of vanishing wavefunction at the point of reﬂection, we
get additional relationships for p and q. Firstly, the phase of the Gaussian beams before
and after reﬂection must exhibit a jump by π. Moreover, considering a reﬂection at the
∆s′
point s = sk, one ﬁnds that the vector (q, p) before and after reﬂection (at s = sk −
and s = sk + ∆s, respectively) must obey the equation

where, M (k)(∆s, ∆s′) is a 2

reﬂection point. It is called the monodromy matrix of the given reﬂection k. Its explicit
form can be stated in terms of the local radius of curvature R = R(k) of the reﬂecting
surface and the angle of incidence χ = χ(k) with respect to the local normal [66] as,

6.10 Round trip stability of periodic orbits

As is expected from a short-wavelength aproximation, the monodromy matrix itself has
a ray interpretation. Equation (347) is precisely the transformation that determines how
a small deviation from the periodic ray path changes the outcome of the reﬂection. As
noted earlier, q and p behave like conjugate variables, and here this fact emerges again.
If we interpret formally q as a cartesian coordinate transverse to the ray direction along
which s varies, and p as the conjugate transverse momentum, then the true periodic orbit
would be described by q = p = 0 and s = 0 . . . L. Nonvanishing p and q at some point
∆s′ denote transverse deviations from the periodic orbit. This leads to straight
s = sk −
line trajectories hitting the surface slightly oﬀ the locations where the exactly periodic
orbit has its reﬂections. The outcome of the reﬂection of this displaced ray is then a ray
deviating from the periodic path by q(sk + ∆s) in position and p(sk + ∆s) in momentum.
To show that these classical quantities are related by (347) in the linear way of a Taylor
expansion for small deviations requires straightforward but tedious trigonometry [59, 66].
The connection between the two requirements of (346) and (347) becomes apparent,
if we extend the monodromy matrix from a single reﬂection to include all N reﬂections
of a full round trip, and ask for the cumulated deviation of the ray, as a function of the
initial displacement in position q and direction (momentum) p. As a result we can see
that in a linear approximation we simply can replace M (k)(∆s, ∆s′) in (347) with the
product M(s) of the N individual monodromy matrices. Assume that we start a ray at
s < s2, with deviation q
longitudinal coordinate s in the ﬁrst leg of the ray path, s1 ≤
and p from the periodic orbit [cf. Fig. 13(a)]. We are then interested in the deviation
incurred along one round trip s + L.

The distance from s to the ﬁrst reﬂection is ∆s′ = s1 −

ﬁrst and second reﬂection accordingly is ∆s = s2 −

s, and the distance between the

The periodicity condition (346) requires that the vector ~d = (q(s), p(s)) is an eigenvector
of matrix M(s). Up to now we retained the dependence on the starting coordinate s.
However, the investigation of the eigenvalue problem becomes simpler when we eliminate

(351)

(352)

this dependence. This is possible because we know how any given trajectory depends on
s: Rays in the cavity follow straight lines, so that q is a linear function of s, whereas p is
in fact a constant. (This can be compared to the similar assumption we made in (345)
with kz instead of s as the longitudinal coordinate). For the vector ~d we can therefore

which is an eigenvalue equation. We know that the coeﬃcient vector
here is
by construction s-independent, and as a consequence, the s dependence of the matrix
1(s + L) M(s)Π(s) must cancel out. The matrix E is the monodromy
product E = Π−
matrix of one whole periodic orbit, because it characterizes the propagation of small
deviations along one round trip irrespective of where exactly we started. Recall, however,
that we set the starting point s on a speciﬁc branch of the periodic orbit. Clearly, the
same arguments would apply with s starting in any other branch, but then the resulting
matrix equation will in general be diﬀerent.

6.11 Eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix

×

Since E is a 2
2 matrix, its eigenvalues and eigenvectors are easily classiﬁed, especially
since E can also be shown to have unit determinant [59]. This follows from det(Π) = 1
together with classical area preservation (Liouville’s theorem) for the ray dynamics; the
latter implies that also det(M(s)) = 1. As det E = 1 the two eigenvalues λ1,2 satisfy

λ1λ2 = 1

and

λ1 + λ2 = Tr(E)

Three cases can be distinguished depending on the value of t:

The periodic ray orbit under consideration is called linearly stable if and only if case
t < 2 holds. If this is satisﬁed in one branch of the path, one can show that it also holds
in all others.

The diﬀerence between these cases can be appreciated if one writes a general vector

~d = (q, p) as a linear combination of the eigenvectors,

~d = a~h1 + b~h2

(358)

and asks for its evolution under repeated application of the round trip mapping E. For
a ν-fold round trip we obtain

Eν ~d = a Eν~h1 + b Eν~h2 = a λν

~h1 + b λν

~h2 = a eiνφ~h1 + b e−

iνφ~h2.

(359)

If ~d is a real vector – as it should be if it describes real ray trajectories – then Eν ~d is
also real because E is a real matrix, describing only the trigonometry of the successive
reﬂections and the straight line ray motion in between (cf. the deﬁnitions of Π and
M(s)). Therefore, we know that in the last equation there can be no imaginary part,
and thus nothing is changed by taking the real part. If ~h1 = (A0, A1), then we have

Eν ~d =

Re[(a + b∗)A0] cos νφ
Re[(a + b∗)A1] cos νφ

Im[(a + b∗)A0] sin νφ
Im[(a + b∗)A1] sin νφ

(360)

Remember that φ is a ﬁxed eigenphase, characteristic of the given branch of the pe-
riodic orbit. If we assume for the moment that ν is not an integer but instead varies
continuously, then the above equation describes an ellipse in the plane spanned by q
and p. For integer ν, the trajectory simply visits discrete points on this elliptical curve
every time it completes a loop. This means that the small initial deviation ~d from the
periodic ray orbit leads to a trajectory which stays close to this original periodic path
for all times. The perturbed ray only performs a small oscillation in transverse position
and momentum around this original path.

In case t > 2, the curve described by Eν ~d is also a conic section, but in this case a
hyperbola instead of an ellipse. To see this, we go back to (360) but with real eigenvalues
of the form λ1 = 1/λ2, cf. (355). Since for real eigenvalues the eigenvectors of the real
matrix E can also be chosen real, we obtain with ξ

λν

Eν ~d = ξ a~h1 +

≡
b~h2 ,

ξ

(361)

which describes a hyperbola if ξ is formally allowed to vary continuously. This con-
struction tells us that the perturbed ray deviates more and more from the periodic path
with increasing ν. Hence a periodic orbit whose monodromy matrix has trace t > 2 is
unstable, and for t < 2 it is stable.

The question of stability is crucial for the applicability of the paraxial approxima-
tion in constructing resonator modes. Only if a ray orbit is stable can the paraxial
approximation be justiﬁed over the whole round trip. In this case one can say that the

85

mirror conﬁguration as seen by the closed ray trajectory and determined by the radii
of curvature R at the successive reﬂection points acts in a focussing way. Recall that
the spreading of the Gaussian beam in each ray segment is given by (350). This will
be unchanged upon a round-trip if q acquires only a phase, not a change in absolute
value. If we determine q according to (353) with ~h = (A0, A1) being an eigenvector of the
monodromy matrix E, then q(s) indeed changes only by the eigenvalue eiφ when after a
round trip we return to the starting point s. This is a mere phase change provided that
the orbit is stable. For unstable orbits, the eigenvalues are real and diﬀerent from unity,
making it impossible to recover a beam with the original spread after one period of the
orbit.

6.12 Resonator eigenfrequencies in the parabolic approximation

The use of the parabolic (Gaussian beam) approximation requires that we identify the
stable periodic ray orbits of the resonator at hand. This can in general be a diﬃcult
task in itself, because their number and location can depend rather sensitively on the
shape of the boundary. Furthermore, it must be kept in mind that there may also be
modes which are not in any way associated with stable ray orbits at all.

Assuming that we have found a set of stable orbits, we can then use the Gaussian
beam solutions to construct the corresponding eigenfrequencies (within the parabolic
approximation). This is done by recalling that the longitudinal coordinate s along the
orbit plays the role of a time-like variable due to the approximation made in (324). In
order for the modal wave function to be single-valued upon a round-trip, the dependence
on s has to be periodic. The imposition of periodic boundary conditions introduces a
longitudinal “quantum number” m counting the nodes along the ray path. The equations
determining the wave solutions are themselves periodic in s, and hence the problem is
analogous to that of a periodically driven time dependent system to which Floquet’s
theorem applies [59], or equivalently to Bloch’s theorem governing the band structure of
spatially periodic solids. The central observation there is that the wavefunction acquires
only a phase factor when a translation amounting to the periodicity interval is carried
out. This is precisely the content of (357) which however holds only when a stable orbit
is present.

Allowing for transverse excitations according to the harmonic oscillator ladder as
described by the generalized operators (338), an additional transverse mode number n
labels the number of nodes in the two-dimensional Gauss-Hermite beam perpendicular
to the propagation axis. The resulting quantized wavenumber is found to be [59]

where L is the round-trip path length of the stable orbit. N is the number of reﬂections
the ray undergoes, and this number enters here to take into account the phase shifts
associated with reﬂection. The phase φ multiplying the transverse excitation state is the
eigenphase of the monodromy matrix as deﬁned in (357). A simple application of this

formula would consist in determining the longitudinal mode spacing. The intuitively
expected result is that an integer number of wavelengths must ﬁt around the ray path.

6.13 Polygonal resonators

6.13.1 Marginally stable orbits

The stability considerations of section 6.11 provide a conceptual background helping us
to understand why pathological eﬀects can occur when the resonator is bounded by a
polygon with straight sides. The example most relevant here are the hexagonal facets
of a molecular sieve crystal we will present in section 7. In case of the hexagon, the
boundary allows neither stable nor unstable orbits. We have precisely the marginal case
t = 2, where the round-trip monodromy matrix exhibits Tr(E) = 2, so that both of its
eigenvalues are unity. The sides of the cavity are then neither focussing nor defocussing,
and the rays deviating slightly from a closed ray path do not describe an elliptical
transverse envelope as they would for a stable ray. One obtains this result by evaluating
the monodromy matrix for a plane interface. The resonator modes for a straight sided
cavity are thus not well approximated by Gaussian beams, as can also be seen from
the simple example of a rectangular cavity, for which the solutions of the scalar wave
equation are (for propagation in the xy plane)

with suitably chosen discrete wavenumbers kx,y and oﬀsets x0, y0.

(363)

This simple example bears no resemblance to Gaussian modes but can be solved ex-
actly because the problem is separable in cartesian coordinates. However, not all polyg-
onal resonator geometries permit a separation of variables. This applies in particular
to hexagonal resonators – the geometry exhibited by the facets of the molecular sieves
microcrystals with which microlasers were realized; cf. 7. For a polygon with precisely
120◦ angles between adjacent sides, any ray lauched at some angle to the surface will go
through only a ﬁnite number of diﬀerent orientations[69], just as in the more familiar
rectangular resonator where there are at most two non-parallel orientations for any ray
path. In the hexagon, a ray encounters the interface with at most three diﬀerent angles
of incidence. Despite this apparent simplicity, there exists no orthogonal coordinate sys-
tem in which the wave equation for the hexagonal cavity can be solved by separation of
variables. This property is not surprising, since there is only a ﬁnite number of suitable
coordinate systems available, and on the other hand there are inﬁnitely many shapes
one can think of.

6.13.2 Triangular and hexagonal resonators

Even when separability is lacking, the resonator problem may sometimes be solvable by
an appropriate ansatz. An example for this is a resonator composed of three straight
sides forming an equilateral triangle on which the ﬁelds are assumed to vanish (Dirichlet

identical wavefunctions if we exchange the quantum numbers m and n, replace n by

Since any linear combination of eigenfunctions with the same k is also an eigenfunc-
tion, there is a considerable ambiguity in the spatial distribution of the wave function
whenever there are degeneracies. For example, for any given m, n we can form the
superposition

Ψm,n = ψm,n + i ˜ψm,n .

Shown in Fig. 14 are the three functions ψm,n, ˜ψm,n and Ψm,n for the particular case
m = 14, n = 21.

Figure 14:

In the equilateral triangle with Dirichlet boundary conditions, degenerate
wave functions (a) and (b) with m = 14, n = 21 are superimposed according
to (366) to obtain a completely diﬀerent spatial intensity pattern (c). Plotted

black as the highest intensity.

88

The wavefunction shown in Fig. 14 (c) has nodal lines along the edges of a set of smaller
triangles inscribed into the original one. The self similarity exhibited by this solution
bears an intriguing resemblance to the intensity patterns recently reported in unstable
laser resontors with a mirror in the shape of an equilateral triangle [70]. Although further
investigations of this emerging ﬁeld of open, unstable resonators are needed, it seems
possible that the transverse mode structure observed in the above laser experiment is
given by a two dimensional wave equation with solutions similar to the ones shown in Fig.
14. The particular linear combinations appearing in any given experimental realization
can be a result of the measurement setup or perturbations that lift the degeneracies.
In particular, complex-valued superpositions as given by (366) become relevant in open
resonators such as those in Ref. [70]. Whereas for a closed resonator with Dirichlet
boundary conditions one can always choose the solutions to be real without losing any
modes, this is not generally possible in open systems, when travelling waves are assumed
to describe the ﬁeld outside the resonator.

The subdivision into smaller triangles in Fig. 14(c) suggests that modes of other
polygonal resonators can be constructed in an analogous way if the boundary can be
decomposed into eqal equilateral triangles. This is the case in particular for the hexagon,
which is composed of six equilateral triangles. A hexagon mode can hence be pieced
together from six copies of any given solution of the triangle problem. However, solutions
obtained in this way do not represent all the possible modes of the larger hexagon
resonator. This is because the triangle solutions necessarily satisfy Dirichlet boundary
conditions on all the sides – also on those which form the diagonals in the hexagon
composition. Clearly, we can expect that there should also be solutions with even parity
under reﬂection at such a diagonal. These would then have vanishing derivative on the
respective diagonals, i.e., satisfy Neumann boundary conditions. Unfortunately, there is
no exact ansatz such as (364) for these diﬀerent symmetry classes of the hexagon.

The hexagon with Dirichlet boundary conditions on its faces therefore is an example
of how not only separation of variables breaks down, but also the more general concept
of integrability fails. The latter essentially means that one can ﬁnd as many (globally
valid) “good quantum numbers” as there are conﬁned degrees of freedom; we managed
to do this in the equilateral triangle but cannot label the solutions of the hexagon
using only these same numbers. Integrability carries over to the classical ray dynamics
in the form of constants of the motion. Nonintegrability is known to be one of the
central characteristics exhibited by wave equations whose classical (short wavelength)
limit exhibits chaos [60]. When the ray dynamics is chaotic, this does not imply that
the rays move in a stochasitc way. They are still governed by the deterministic laws of
total internal reﬂection and refraction, and in particular inﬁnitely many periodic orbits
can be found. However, if for the extreme case of a fully chaotic system we calculate the
monodromy matrices for these periodic orbits, they all turn out to yield TrE > 2 and
hence describe unstable (hyperbolic) orbits.

Hexagonal resonators are therefore an example of a “pathological” intermediate class
of microresonators for which the ray dynamics is not chaotic, but not integrable as well.
These systems have been termed pseudo-integrable [68]. It is interesting to observe that
the modes with which the pathological nature of the problem manifests itself are precisely

89

those which are not required by symmetry to vanish on the diagonals of the hexagon. Or
with other words, parity with respect to the diagonal does not in itself predetermine the
value of the wave function at the corners of the hexagon. Thus, the corners are the root
of pseudointegrabilty in these polygons with Dirichlet boundary conditions, because they
give rise to corner diﬀraction. Corners are singularities at which the tangent direction
changes discontinuously. Diﬀraction arises here because the length scale over which the
tangent direction changes (the radius of curvature) is ideally zero, and hence certainly
much smaller than the wavelength [71]. The angle subtended by the corners determines
whether or not a pseudointegrable cavity is created. In the rectangular cavity, as well as
in the equilateral triangle, the eﬀects of diﬀraction at the corners cancel each other out.
An interesting wavelength eﬀect was reported in Ref. [72]. Sharp corners of a polyg-
onal billiard are smoothed over the distance of one wavelength. This means that the
system becomes indistinguishable from a slightly “streamlined” billiard that would be
obtained by rounding the corners in such a way as to obtain an everywhere smooth
boundary. This leads to an apparent contradiction: classically chaotic billiards with a
continuously varying tangent (“smooth” walls) can be inﬁnitesimally well approximated
by polygonal domains that are themselves never chaotic, but at most pseudointegrable.
From a stability analysis of the periodic orbits in either the original chaotic system or the
inscribed polygonal approximant, one ﬁnds that the former exhibits unstable periodic
orbits, whereas the latter displays only marginally stable periodic paths. Although one
should thus expect the resulting mode structure to be qualitatively diﬀerent, the spectral
structure in a ﬁxed frequency interval can become indistinguishable for the two cases.
In section 7.2 we will discuss numerical solutions of the Helmholtz equation, and how
this smoothing on a wavelength scale manifests itself in speciﬁc realisations of molecular
sieve microresonators.

Because we are interested in dielectric materials forming open resonators, we shall not
go into further detail concerning the intriguing problem of semiclassically quantizing
pseudointegrable cavities, but instead we discuss brieﬂy the relevance of corners in the
presence of leaky boundary conditions. The breakdown of the short wavelength approx-
imation near corners will also manifest itself in the emission from hexagonal dielectric
cavities. The concept of pseudointegrability loses its signiﬁcance in the case of an open
resonator, because dielectric interfaces can destroy integrability as easily as sharp corners
do. An example is the rectangular cavity made up of a homogenous dielectric surrounded
by air. The dielectric constant can be written as ǫ(x, y) = 1 + ǫmΘ(
)
|
|
where ǫm is the permittivity of the medium. Due to the term 1, the Helmholtz equation
cannot be reduced to two one-dimensional problems for the x and y coordinate sepa-
rately, as was the case in (363). In the limiting case of large permittivity the oﬀending
1 can be dropped, which restores separability, because this corresponds precisely to the
case of a closed resonator. As was observed in Ref. [73], the boundary conditions of a
polygonal resonator (determined in this case by the spacial distribution of the refractive
index) can be of greater signiﬁcance than diﬀraction for essential (in that study statis-
tical) properties of the spectrum. It is thus not clear at present if dielectric resonators
are suitable to search for signatures of pseudointegrability as it was deﬁned for closed
resonators.

7 Actual realizations of microlasers based on molecular

sieve-dye compounds

After the discussion in previous sections we can now venture to give a deﬁnition of
what a microlaser is. A microlaser is a structure in which only a few (in the limit
one) mode of the light ﬁeld interacts with a collection of atoms or molecules, so that
spontaneous emission processes are enhanced or inhibited, or in which lasing occurs
It is in principle possible to observe these cavity eﬀects
without a visible threshold.
in large (103 . . . 104 λ) resonators with small mode volume (confocal resonators). But
because of the small frequency spacing (free spectral range) of the longitudinal resonator
modes, cavity eﬀects in large resonators can only occur when the linewidth of the atomic
transition is smaller than the free spectral range of the cavity – a condition which can
only be met by very dilute atomic systems such as an atom beam, but not by atoms or
molecules in a condensed state. As the condensed state linewidth of atoms or molecules
is in the order of 1 nm to 100 nm, cavity eﬀects will only be observable with resonators
exhibiting a correspondigly large mode frequency spacing, that means resonator sizes
of a one half to few wavelengths. In the past, wavelength size resonators were realized
with semiconductors as microdisks [74, 75] or VCSELs (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting
Lasers) [76]–[80], and with organic dyes in planar resonators as Langmuir-Blodgett [81]
or liquid ﬁlms [35], or embedded in polymer spheres [82]–[84]. This work was discussed
recently in several reviews [85]-[89] so that here we will concentrate on microlasers based
on organic dye molecules embedded in molecular sieve microcrystals [3]. Before we turn
to the proper optical and laser properties, we will shortly discuss the synthesis of the
compounds.

7.1 Molecular sieve crystals as host material for microlasers

As is reviewed in the previous chapter Nanoporous compound materials for optical ap-
plications – Material design and properties, molecular sieve materials are characterized
by a crystallographically deﬁned framework of regularly arranged pores. In Table 1 we
list some sieves with wide channel pores, in which optically eﬀective organic molecules
can be inserted. Among the listed materials especially the aluminophosphate AlPO4-5
(molecular mass 1463.4 g/mol) can be synthesized with good optical transparency and
low internal scattering losses. In addition, the AlPO4-5 channel pores exhibit a diameter
of 0.73 nm, ﬁt to accommodate a variety of laser active organic dye molecules. The struc-
ture is shown in Fig. 15. AlPO4-5–crystals are crystallized from aqueous or alcoholic
solutions under hydrothermal conditions, with the addition of an organic structurizing
agent, called template. The template is a necessary device in the synthesis of molecular
sieves to direct the chemical reactions towards the desired crystal structure. For the
synthesis of the AlPO4-5 laser crystals tri-n-propylamine was used as template. The
preferred pH range for the synthesis is mildly acidic to mildly basic, while the source of
phosphor is mostly orthophosphoric acid, and the sources of aluminum are pseudoboeh-
mite or alkoxides [91]. It was shown that single crystals with nearly perfect morphology
can be grown using hydroﬂuoric acid [92], and with a specially prepared and aged alu-
minum hydroxide gel crystal sizes around 1 mm in c-axis direction were obtained [93].
In addition, microwave heating proved to increase the crystallization rates by more than
one order of magnitude [92, 94].

Pure AlPO4-5 crystals are optically transparent from below 400 nm to above 800 nm
and exhibit a refractive index of n(500 nm) = 1.466. After removing the template
(usually by heating) they show practically no birefringent properties. X-ray diﬀraction
revealed patterns which are consistent with space group P 6
m cc as well as P6cc. The
latter group, however, corresponds to a polar structure: In fact, the 4 in the formula
AlPO4-5 is the result of the strict alternation of Al and P in the tetrahedral nodes of
the framework, which prevents the corner-sharing oxygen tetrahedra to occur with odd
numbers, and which leads to an alternating stacking of Al and P in the direction of the
channels (c-axis); cf. Fig. 15. This alternance is assumed to cause the crystallographic
polar nature [95] of the framework [96]. The macroscopic polar nature of AlPO4-5 single
crystals was proven recently in scanning pyroelectric microscopy investigations [97], and
it was observed that AlPO4-5 crystals are usually twinned. The murky stripes inside
the pyridine 2-loaded crystals shown in Fig. 18 and their slightly bowed side faces could
well be a result of this kind of twinning. At this moment it is not clear, however, to
what extent twinning should aﬀect the properties relevant for luminescence and lasing
discussed here.

Up to now laser action was obtained in two diﬀerent compounds, namely in AlPO4-5
loaded with 1-ethyl-4-(4-(p-dimethylaminophenyl)-1,3-butadienyl)-pyridinium perchlo-
rate (pyridine 2 [98]), and with a modiﬁed rhodamine B dye. In the following we will
discuss the two materials in more detail.

7.1.1 AlPO4-5/pyridine2 compound

These AlPO4-5–dye compounds were synthesized [99] following a procedure in which the
dye 1-ethyl-4-(4-(p-dimethylaminophenyl)-1,3-butadienyl)-pyridinium perchlorate (trade
name pyridine 2 [98]), cf. Fig. 16, is added to the template or to the aluminum hydroxide
suspension [100, 101, 102]. After 1 h of hydrothermal synthesis dark red crystals with
a length of up to 100 µm are obtained. As the linear dye molecules ﬁt snugly into the
0.73 nm wide channel pores of the nanoporous AlPO4-5 host, they become aligned along
the crystal c-axis. As a result the compound exhibits strong dichroism, and the emit-
ted ﬂuorescence light is polarized parallel to the c-axis. This is documented in Fig. 18.
It is also observed that with the inclusion of pyridine 2 the entire compound acquires

pyroelectric properties and an optical second order susceptibility [3]. Even though the
size of the dye molecules is well compatible with the channel diameter, the dye content

94

visibly aﬀects the crystal morphology. Regular hexagonal crystals with a rodlike form,
as e.g. the ones shown in Fig. 17(left), or Fig. 18, are obtained when the dye content is
low, around 0.1 wt% or 1 molecule per 260 unit cells. At higher concentrations the dye
accumulates in the middle of the crystal, and the disturbances grow: at a dye content
of ' 0.2 wt%, crystals with a characteristic fascicular shape resulted; cf. Fig 17(right).
Given the small size of the crystals the dye content was determined by chemically dis-
solving them. With this method, however, it is not possible to accurately determine the
spatial distribution of the dye. Therefore the content was also evaluated qualitatively
by comparing the depth of the color. It is only with these fascicled pyridine 2-loaded
crystals where laser emission was observed. Apparently, in the undisturbed rod-shaped
crystals the low concentration of dye does not spoil the growth, but it is not suﬃcient
to provide the necessary optical gain for compensating all losses either.

7.1.2 AlPO4-5/rhodamine BE50 compound

Figure 19: Structure formula of the new dye rhodamine BE50 (ethanaminium, N-[6-
(diethylamino)-9-[2-(N, N-dimethyl-3-amino-1-propoxycarbonyl)phenyl]-3H-
xanthen-3-ylidene]-N-ethyl-chloride) molecular mass 564 g/mol [103].

The second molecular sieve dye compound which exhibited lasing properties was ob-
tained by including a modiﬁed rhodamine B dye in an AlPO4-5 crystal. The size of
rhodamine molecules exceeds the dimensions of the channel pores in AlPO4-5 crystals.
As a result the rhodamine B is normally not accepted inside crystal pores but adheres at
the exterior. The group of Schulz-Ekloﬀ and W¨ohrle started an attempt to accomplish
rhodamine inclusion in AlPO4-5 crystals, even so the pores are too small. Their idea
is to modify the dye molecule in a way that makes the dye molecule electrically resem-
ble a template molecule. Their new derivative rhodamine BE50 (ethanaminium, N-[6-
(diethylamino)-9-[2-(N, N-dimethyl-3-amino-1-propoxycarbonyl)phenyl]-3H-xanthen-3-y-
lidene]-N-ethyl-chloride; cf. Fig. 19) was synthesized by esteriﬁcation of rhodamine B
(Rh B) with 3-dimethylamino-1-propanol [103]. It was shown that the concentration of
rhodamine BE50 (Rh BE50) achievable by crystallization inclusion in AlPO4-5 exceeds
the possible Rh B concentration by a factor of 3–4. This was attributed to the diﬀerent
molecule structures, i.e., to the zwitterionic nature of Rh B on one hand, and to the ad-
ditional positive charge of a protonated aliphatic amino group of Rh BE50 on the other
hand [103]. The latter molecules with the localized positive charge are more compatible

95

with the AlPO4-5 framework than the delocalized charge of Rh B. As a consequence they
observe that at a given dye concentration Rh BE50 inclusion leads to a better crystal
morphology than Rh B inclusion [104].

Figure 20: Morphology of typical rhodamine BE50/AlPO4-5 crystals with lasing prop-
erties; dye content ca. 0.5 wt-% or 1 dye molecule per 75 unit cells.

The gel for the synthesis of the AlPO4 crystals is prepared according to recipes [95,
105] which are modiﬁed for the purpose of crystallization inclusion of dyes [106]. To
a suspension of 61.6 mmol Al2O3 as aluminum source [107] and 75 g deionized water,
61.6 mmol P2O5 [108] in 11.3 g deionized water is added under mechanical stirring.
After 5 min a uniform gel formed and then 92.4 mmol tripropylamine [109] is added
slowly. Subsequently, the appropriate amount (0.1–10 mmol) of Rh BE50 dye powder
is mixed with the gel. The synthesis of the Rh BE50/AlPO4-5 crystals is performed by
microwave heating [110], which proved to be superior in respect of avoiding damage of
sensitive dyes like coumarines [111] as well as of reducing the time of synthesis [103].
Unlike the pyridine 2 molecules, which with a diameter of 0.6 nm ﬁt into the 0.73 nm wide
1.36 nm2
pores of the AlPO4-5 host, the Rh BE50 molecules with dimension of 0.91
are accommodated in defect sites, or mesopores, of the host crystal. Remarkably, up to
concentrations of 1 molecule per 75 unit cells this remains without any visible negative
consequences for the crystal morphology, as is documented in Fig. 20.

×

In Fig. 18 the dichroic properties of the compound are illustrated. In comparison with
the pyridine-2/AlPO4-5 compound, the dichroism of the Rh BE50 compound is reduced
and the ﬂuorescence emission is only partially polarized. This is an indication that the
electrical anisotropy of the host structure does not fully carry through the mesopores,
resulting in a weak dye alignment in the statistical average.

7.2 Microresonator structure

As is visible in Fig. 18 – and as the polarization of the emitted ﬂuorescence of the com-
pounds indicates – the absorption, as well as the emission dipole moment of the included
dyes are oriented preferentially along the crystal c-axis (in the pyridine 2/AlPO4-5 com-
pound the orientation is complete). As dipole emission along the dipole axis is not

96

possible, the emission parallel to a plane perpendicular to the prevailing dipole orienta-
tion (i.e. the hexagonal axis) is enhanced. Here a bundle of emission directions meets
the condition for total internal reﬂection (TIR) at the hexagonal side faces inside the
crystal. In a whispering-gallery-mode-like way the corresponding emission can circulate
suﬃciently often to accumulate the gain required to overcome the lasing threshold; cf.
Fig. 2 in which this intuitive model is illustrated for a particular ray bundle of high
symmetry. However in section 6 we have shown that for resonators with a sizes in the
order of a few wavelengths the naive ray picture does not correctly represent the ﬁeld
modes. E.g. the ray picture insinuates a mode concentration in the center of the faces
but ﬁeld-free corners. This, however, is not consistent with the experimental evidence,
which clearly shows that the emission occurs at the corners; cf. Fig. 26. As we already
pointed out in section 6.13, the main feature that distinguishes the hexagonal resonator
from other common whispering-gallery type cavities such as microdroplets [112] or semi-
conductor disk lasers [67, 113], is that the latter do not exhibit sharp corners and ﬂat
sides. There we described that portions of the boundary in convex resonators act as fo-
cussing or defocussing elements, whereas the straight sides of a hexagon are neither one
nor the other. As a result we have shown that ray paths in the hexagon display a degree
of complexity that cannot be classiﬁed as chaotic and was called pseudointegrable.

The closed ray path underlying Fig. 2 is only one member of an inﬁnite family of
periodic orbits of the hexagon billiard that all have the same length, L = 3
W oF .
Long-lived cavity modes exist only if the corresponding rays satisfy the condition of TIR
at the interface, sin χ > 1/n, where χ is the angle of incidence with respect to the surface
normal. In a naive ray approach one would furthermore obtain the spectrum of modes
by requiring an integer number of half wavelengths to ﬁt into L, leading to constructive
interference on a round-trip. As we shall see shortly, this estimate is justiﬁed, even
though a proper treatment of the ray-wave connection has to take into account that any
given mode is in fact made up of a whole family of diﬀerent ray paths. The ultimate
breakdown of the ray model, however, occurs when a ray orbit hits the corners where the
classical laws of refraction and reﬂection are no longer deﬁned. To characterize the size
of the samples, we can specify either the radius R of the hexagon at the corner points
or – more conveniently – the width over ﬂats (WoF) characterized by R = W oF/√3.

×

7.2.1 Wave picture: spectral properties

Because the hexagonal faces are neither focussing nor defocussing, there is no obvious
way of determining the weight that should be given to individual members of a ray
family in order to predict the spatial structure of the resulting mode. Full solutions of
Maxwell’s equations have therefore been carried out for the TM polarized modes of a
dielectric hexagonal prism, using methods previously applied in [67, 113] and discussed
in section 6. In anticipation of the experimental spectra discussed in section 7.3, we focus
on three diﬀerent sample sizes characterized by a WoF of 4.5 µm, 7.5 µm, and 22 µm.
The aim is to understand the observed laser line spacings and the emission directionality.
To document that orbits of diﬀerent families determine the characteristic mode spac-
ing of the cavity, Fig. 21 shows scattering spectra for diﬀerent sample sizes in the vicinity

Each of the peaks marked in Fig. 21(b) is in fact a multiplet which is not resolved,
because the splittings of the individual modes comprising the multiplet are smaller than
their passive linewidths. There is evidence for this because several of the peaks are
very asymmetric, and in particular exhibit a steep slope on one side. For an isolated
resonance, the most general lineshape that could arise is the Fano function (of which
the Lorentzian is a special case), which however does not yield satisfactory ﬁts here.

To further expose the multiplet structure, we modeled deviations from the ideal hexag-
onal shape which could lead to narrower individual linewidths and increase the multiplet
splitting. Shape perturbations were chosen that preserve the D6h point group symmetry
and hence remove only “accidental” quasi-degeneracies. The actual perturbation that
is present in the samples of Figs. 24 and 25 eluded experimental characterization, so
that a model calculation can reproduce only generic features which are insensitive to
the precise type of perturbation. One such feature is the average mode spacing after
degeneracies have been lifted suﬃciently.

7.2.2 Wave picture: intensity proﬁle

There is one class of quasi-degeneracies that is not removed by any of the perturbations
in Fig. 22. Their physical origin is time reversal symmetry for the ray motion inside the
cavity. Any of the periodic orbits can be traversed either clockwise or counterclockwise,

99

and the same holds for more general ray paths. The diﬀerent propagation directions can
be linearly combined in various ways to obtain nearly-degenerate standing-wave patterns
that diﬀer only in their parity with respect to some of the crystal’s reﬂection axes. A
minute splitting does exist because the nonintegrability of the ray motion implies that
the propagation direction itself is not a “good quantum number”, i.e. reversals of the
sense of rotation are unlikely but not impossible in the wave equation. This is analogous
to quantum tunneling and hence leads only to exponentially small splittings that can
be neglected on the scale of the individual resonance linewidths [115]. These multiplets
have been counted as one resonance in (367).

Figure 23: False-color representation of the cross-sectional intensity in the ideal hexagon
for a mode with (a) kR = 22.89 [cf. Fig. 21 (a)] and (b) kR = 42.78 [cf. Fig. 21
(b)]. The resonance width is δ(kR) = 0.10 in (a) and δ(kR) = 0.04 in (b).

Following this reasoning, in Fig. 23 the traveling-wave patterns belonging to one of
the resonances in Fig. 21(a) and (b), respectively, is plotted. High intensity ridges inside
the resonator form a whispering-gallery-like pattern that decays from the interface into
the cavity center. The number of ridges in the radial direction (perpendicular to a side
face) provides an approximate analogue of a transverse mode order, however upon closer
examination one sees that the number of ridges and nodal lines is not uniquely deﬁned,
in particular along a diameter joining opposite corners. The modes can therefore not be
properly labeled by “good quantum numbers” characterizing the number of radial and
azimuthal nodes – this is a direct consequence of the nonintegrability of the problem.
The most signiﬁcant diﬀerence to the whispering-gallery modes of a circular cavity is
clearly the anisotropic emission. High intensity is seen to emanate predominantly from
the corners and is directed almost parallel to an adjacent crystal facet. The overall
emission pattern is very similar in both modes despite the large diﬀerence in size (or
kR) between the two hexagons.

7.3 Laser properties

The dye loaded molecular sieve microcrystals presented in section 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 were
excited with 10 ns pulses from the 532 nm second harmonic of a Nd:YAG-laser, and
the emitted luminescence was collected with a 42◦ aperture lens relaying the microlaser
emission to a spectrometer and an imaging system consisting of a cooled low noise
CCD-camera.

7.3.1 Pyridine2 AlPO4-5 compound

In Fig. 24 the emission and lasing spectra of three pyridine 2-loaded compounds with
diﬀerent dye content are compared. Fig. 24a represents the class of regularly shaped
samples with a low dye content around 0.1 wt% [cf. also Fig. 17(left)]. In this class the
ﬂuorescence emission maximum was observed between 645 nm to 665 nm, where the
shift to longer wavelength correlates with the increase of dye content that was assessed
by the saturation of the red color. In none of these rod-shaped crystals laser emission
was observed.

Figure 24: Emission and lasing spectra of diﬀerent pyridine 2-loaded compounds with
from a to c increasing amounts of included dye. The dye concentration was
estimated empirically based on the sample color depth. The width over ﬂats
of sample b is 4 µm. The free spectral range (FSR) of this resonator is so
large (ca. 25 nm) that only one emission mode acquires the available gain,
resulting in single line emission. On the other hand, sample c is ca. 5 times
larger. In this case the FSR is around 5 nm so that laser emission can occur
on a multitude of modes simultaneously.

However, narrow laser emission peaks were observed in fascicled samples with a de-
tected linewidth of ca. 0.3 nm which was limited by the spectrometer resolution. Here
the emission maxima were observed at wavelenghts up to 695 nm, and again, increasing
dye concentration correlated with increasing redshift (cf. Figs. 24b and c). As already
mentioned, together with the increasing dye content the crystal morphology becomes
more and more disturbed. The observation of a disturbed morphology and the red-shift

101

of the emission spectrum are consistent with the hypothesis of a host-guest interaction
which increases with dye content.
In fact both, the pyridine 2 molecules, as well as
the AlPO4-5 framework, carry a static dipole moment [95, 96]. As a consequence, the
increased buildup of electrostatic energy in the crystal lattice has to be compensated
by an increasing amount of stacking faults. On the other side, the mechanism of the
redshift is not unequivocally identiﬁed, yet, but is probably related to the one discussed
in [116, 117].

concentration around 75 unit cells per dye molecule and size of 7.5 µm width

7.3.2 Rhodamine BE50 AlPO4-5 compound

Also with these samples the same correlation between the emission wavelength and dye
concentration was observed; cf. also [103]. In contrast to the pyridine 2-loaded samples,
the ﬂuorescence emission was not completely polarized. The observed polarization con-
trast cp = Ik−
was around 10%, indicating that in the average the Rh BE50 molecules
are only weakly aligned with respect to the host crystal. Laser emission was observed in
samples with a dye concentration around 75 unit cells per dye molecule, corresponding
to 0.5 wt%; cf. Fig. 25.

7.3.3 Laser properties of molecular sieve dye compounds

Independent of the type of loading, in most microcrystals with W oF ' 8 µm lasing
was observed to occur on several sharp lines with instrument resolution limited width (a
typical example is shown in Fig. 25). In general the laser emission lines are not equally
spaced. In fact, the free spectral range (F SR) of 11 nm corresponding to the resonator
size of W oF = 8 µm is far above the line spacing of 3.2, 4.3 and 3.4 nm shown in
Fig. 25. This is in agreement with the theoretical model of paragraph 7.2.1, in which

102

the average lasing mode spacing (after lifting the quasi-degeneracies in the ideal hexagon)
was estimated to be ∆λ = 3.6 nm. Also in agreement with the theoretical discussion
are the regions where the laser light leaves the hexagonal resonators. Figure 26(left)
shows the laser emission as bright spots. Clearly the emission is concentrated along the
crystal edges. The complex emission distribution is compatible with the simultaneously
recorded spectrum (cf. Fig. 25) which reveals emission on four modes.

While the average line spacing of 3.6 nm observed in the sample of Fig. 25 is not
compatible with the free spectral range of ∆λ = 12 nm of the corresponding resonator,
the 4.2 nm spacing of the 3 dominant peaks in the sample shown in Fig. 24c is in accord
with the F SR resulting from the 22-µm-WoF hexagonal resonator. On the other hand,
the theoretical model for the 22 µm-WoF hexagonal resonator (cf. Eq. (367)) yields an
average mode spacing of ∆λ
0.5 nm which is close to the spectrometer resolution. This
high spectral density explains the large background in the lasing spectrum of Fig. 24: It
is likely that not all the individual lasing modes in this sample are resolved, and hence
part of the shoulder on which the three peaks of curve c sit is probably shaped by a
series of closely spaced lasing modes.

≈

On the other hand, samples with smaller resonator (W oF ' 4 µm), as e.g. the one
shown in Fig. 24b, emitted one single laser line. Thus the emission is unadulterated by
hole burning induced multimode beating and interference, and this results in the simple
emission pattern shown in Fig 26(right), where two ca. 1 µm-spots (
microscope res-
olution limit) mark the region of laser emission, which, again, is located at the crystal
edges. Remarkably, compared to larger samples, the ratio of the line peak to the un-
derlying ﬂuorescence shoulder of these small lasers is an order of magnitude higher (cf.
Figs. 24 and 27).

7.3.4 Laser threshold

Figure 27 illustrates the diﬀerential eﬃciency behavior of a typical microlaser with
W oF < 10 µm and one with W oF > 10 µm. Lasing threshold for the latter size samples
was around 0.5 MW/cm2, regardless of the type of dye loading. On the other side,
crystals of smaller size (W oF = 4 µm) from the same synthesis batch revealed a con-
siderably smaller threshold (0.12 MW/cm2) and a factor of > 7 larger diﬀerential gain.
We assume that this is a consequence of the quantum size eﬀects which we described in
section 5.

It is informative to compare the threshold of molecular sieve microlasers with vertical
cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs). For that we convert the pump irradiance I
(incident optical power per unit area) into a ﬂux of photons φ (number of pump photons
per second incident on the mode cross section A)

If η denotes the eﬃciency with which an incident pump photon actually contributes to
an excitation, then φ
η corresponds to the number of quantum processes per second
required to reach a given level of inversion. Multiplication of this number with the
19As gives the electric current which corresponds to
charge of an electron qe = 1.6
the pump current ﬂowing in a comparable electric device, such as a VCSEL. According
to (368) the threshold power density of 0.12 MW/cm2 incident on the surface of the
4 µm (cf. Fig. 26b) corresponds to a ﬂux
molecular sieve laser shown in Fig. 24b of 1
1 532-nm-photons. If we take into account that the pump ﬁeld was not
of 1.4
polarized, but the dye molecules are aligned, then only 50% of the pump photons could
contribute to the inversion. In addition the absorption length for 532 nm radiation is
longer than the crystal size so that only a fraction of the incident pump is absorbed
by the dye molecules.
If we assume that 50% of the pump are absorbed, then the
eﬀects of polarization and absorbtion length together result in a quantum eﬃciency of
η = 0.25. With this quantum eﬃciency we obtain a comparable electric threshold current
of 560 µA, which compares well with the threshold current of VCSELs of comparable
size. Thus, in terms of elementary (quantum) pump processes needed to reach lasing
threshold the molecular sieve lasers are as good as actual VCSELs.

7.4 Photostability

Photostability is usually a critical issue with organic dyes. Corresponding investigations
were carried out with pyridine 2, as well as rhodamine BE50 loaded samples, revealing
some unexpected results.

7.4.1 Photostability of pyridine 2 compounds

The photostability of pyridine 2 compounds was studied with samples exhibiting an
undisturbed morphology, similar to the one shown in Fig. 18. The samples were irradi-
ated with 10 Hz trains of 10 ns pulses of the 532 nm second harmonic of a Nd:YAG-laser

and a power density of 5 MW/cm2. Figure 28 illustrates the wane of ﬂuorescence ac-
tivity of a pyridine 2-loaded AlPO4-5 sample under such bleaching irradiation. After
a bleaching period of 140 seconds the exposure was interrupted for 18 minutes. Then
the bleaching procedure was resumed. The ﬁgure shows that the ﬂuorescence recovers
during the intermission.

The physical origin of this unexpected ﬂuorescence recovery is not clear yet. If we
assume that bleaching consists in breaking bonds of the dye molecules, then we have
to consider bond energies in the eV-range. Even if we assume that the dye debris stay
encaged in their pores, spontaneous or thermally activated self healing of broken eV-
bonds seems not very probable. Considering the stereometrically restricted possibilities
inside the molecular sieve framework together with diﬀusion distances of several µm,
and the observed recovery time in the range of minutes, we believe that diﬀusion of
new, intact dye molecules into the irradiated crystal volume is more plausible than self
healing.

As bleaching reduces the concentration of dye, a blueshift of the ﬂuorescence is ex-
pected with increasing photobleaching [95, 96]. However, the 656-nm-ﬂuorescence emis-
sion maximum of this sample is already at the shortest observed wavelength (cf. Fig. 24),
corresponding to a low dye concentration, and consequently, to weak dipole interactions.
Thus, the blueshift under these circumstances must be rather small. This explains that
a blueshift was not observed with these pyridine 2-loaded samples.

7.4.2 Photostability of rhodamine BE50 compounds

The rhodamine BE50-loaded samples under investigation contained dye at a concentra-
tion of around one Rh BE50 molecule per 75 unit cells, and therefore bleaching caused a
detectable 4 nm shift of the ﬂuorescence towards the blue. The 532 nm bleach irradiance

cence activity as a function of time: After a ﬁrst bleach period of 140 seconds
the bleach beam is interrupted for 18 minutes. During this intermission the
ﬂuorescence recovers to start the second bleach period with 3

sion. Right: The bleaching laser is incident from the left and concentrated

was 0.5 MW/cm2 with this samples. In contrast to the pyridine 2 samples these crystals
exhibited laser emission. Observing the laser emission spectrum while bleaching the
samples, a further consequence of the blueshift was revealed: Blueshift of the ﬂuores-
cence reduces the overlap of the ﬂuorescence band with the absorption spectrum, and as
a result, laser modes at lower wavelengths will suﬀer less losses with increasing bleaching.
This is documented in Fig. 29, where the intensity of mode b with the shortest oscil-
lating wavelength increases, while longer-wavelength-modes a and c decrease during the
bleach procedure. At the same time a 0.2 nm blueshift of the oscillation wavelength was
detected. We attribute this to a weak decrease of the refractive index of the resonator
material due to the smaller polarizability of the dye debris. In contrast to the pyridine
2 samples, however, recovery of the ﬂuorescence was not detected. As we mentioned in
section 7.1.2 the Rh 50BE molecules are considerably larger than pyridine 2 molecules,
and are encaged in mesopores. As a result their mobility in the molecular sieve frame-
work is severly hampered. So, diﬀusion of intact molecules into the bleached volume
occurs – if ever – on timescales considerably larger than minutes. This is probably the
reason why ﬂuorescence recovery was not observed in rhodamine BE50 compounds.

8 Conclusion

This chapter was centered on microscopic lasers realized with nanoporous materials,
especially molecular sieve dye compounds. We discussed the eﬀects of a microresonator
on spontaneous and stimulated emission properties, and we showed that wavelength
scale laser resonators may exhibit lasing without threshold. Such eﬀects are not just

c decrease.

thoughtful observations, but were investigated in real devices as well, and we reviewed
observations of threshold reduction in molecular sieve lasers.

The microresonators of the molecular sieve lasers which were presented up to now
exhibit a hexagonal resonator geometry. Hexagonal microresonators in which the light
ﬁeld is conﬁned by total internal reﬂection at the dielectric boundary deﬁne a new class
of pseudointegrable optical structure of which we reviewed the properties in some detail.
As mentioned, molecular sieve microlasers can be fabricated in large amounts with
the same large scale processes which are used to produce the molecular sieve crystallites
in the petrochemical industry. Although applications of such laser powders have not
been reported yet, many practical uses can be envisaged, such as for example in eﬃcient
ﬂuorescent, or even lasing paint pigments or lasing pixels.

Experimental evidence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in

intracavity type-II second harmonic generation with triple

resonance

We describe an experiment showing a spontaneous symmetry breaking phe-

nomenon between the intensities of the ordinary and extraordinary components of

the fundamental ﬁeld in intracavity type-II harmonic generation. It is based on a

triply resonant dual cavity containing a type II phase matched χ(2) crystal pumped

at the fundamental frequency ω0. The pump beam generates in the cavity a second

harmonic mode at frequency 2ω0 which acts as a pump for frequency degenerate

type II parametric down conversion. Under operating conditions which are precisely

symmetric with respect to the ordinary and extraordinary components of the fun-

damental wave, we have observed a breaking of the symmetry on the intensities of

these two waves in agreement with the theoretical predictions.

Triply Resonant Optical Parametric Oscillators are well-known to have a rich dynam-

ical behavior showing in particular bistability, self-oscillation and chaos [1, 2]. We study

here a similar system consisting in a type-II phase matched crystal placed inside a triply

resonant cavity but where the pumping is made at the fundamental frequency ω0, not at

the harmonic frequency 2ω0. In this case, both second harmonic generation and parametric
down-conversion simultaneously occur. The pump wave is sent at 45◦ of the crystal neutral

axes and is frequency doubled. The produced harmonic wave acts then as a pump for an

OPO inside the same cavity and using the same crystal. This system has been widely studied

theoretically for its classical and quantum properties [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The system is a priori

symmetric : the ordinary and extraordinary fundamental waves intensities are in general

equal at the output of an OPO. However, a spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon

is predicted to occur under some circumstances : the intracavity signal and idler intensities

may be diﬀerent. In this letter, we report what is to our knowledge the ﬁrst experimental

demonstration of this phenomenon.

We consider a ring cavity (ﬁgure (1)) containing a χ(2) crystal with type-II phase match-
ing. This cavity is pumped with a beam at frequency ω0 polarized at 45◦ of the crystal

neutral axes, (1) and (2).

Pumped by the intracavity second harmonic ﬁeld, parametric oscillation takes place on

the down-converted ﬁelds frequencies ω1 and ω2 (with ω1 + ω2 = 2ω0) which minimize the

threshold [8]. The non frequency degenerate case has been considered both theoretically and

experimentally [9, 10, 11] and spontaneous symmetry breaking is not predicted in this case.

Here, we suppose that the the system is operated at frequency degeneracy (ω1 = ω2 = ω0) :

the down-converted ﬁelds are at the frequency of the input ﬁeld and interfere with it. We

denote A1,2 the intracavity ﬁeld enveloppes at frequency ω0 and A0 the intracavity ﬁeld

enveloppe at frequency 2ω0. The corresponding detunings are denoted

∆1,2 =

(n1,2l + L) [2π] and ∆0 =

(n0l + L) [2π].

where n0,1,2 are the crystal indices of refraction, l is the crystal length and L the free

propagation length inside the cavity. When the optical length of the cavity is adjusted

so that all ﬁelds are close to resonance and the intracavity losses small, the normalized

equations for the normalized intracavity ﬁeld enveloppes can be written :

where Ain is the pump ﬁeld, γ′ and γ0 correspond respectively to the round trip amplitude
losses for the pump and second harmonic wave, while √2γ is the transmission of the coupling

mirror M1 at frequency ω0). In a standard OPO, the system oscillates on the frequency pairs

which verify

∆1 = ∆2 = ∆.

In our case, the frequencies are ﬁxed by the injected ﬁeld but we assume, which is ex-

perimentally realistic, that the system parameters can be adjusted so that relation (5) is

veriﬁed. Equation (4) leads to an expression for A0 as a function of A1 and A2 which can

be re-injected in equations (2) and (3). One obtains then a system of two nonlinear coupled

equations for A1 and A2. From this system, one can obtain the following relation :

while the dissymmetric solution is stable in the opposite case (I > Ithreshold). The symmetry-

breaking phenomenon can be understood in the following way : above Ithreshold, frequency

degenerate parametric oscillation takes place. The generated subharmonic ﬁeld can be shown

[4] to be polarized the direction (DP) of ﬁgure (1), i.e. orthogonally to the pump polarization
(IP). The total ﬁeld at frequency ω0 is therefore no longer at 45◦ from the crystal axes, leading
to the symmetry breaking phenomenon. Furthermore, because of the well-known π phase

indeterminacy of the subharmonic ﬁeld in the degenerate OPO, the vectorial sum of the

ﬁelds at frequency ω0 can take two diﬀerent values : as a result, the lower and upper values

of I1 and I2 can be taken by any of the two polarizations (1) or (2), and the system may

switch from one solution to the other. Equations (7) and (9) allow one to plot the intracavity

intensities as a function of the various parameters of the system. The corresponding plots

are shown in ﬁg. 2.

The top graph shows a pitchfork bifurcation phenomenon as a function of the input inten-

sity : below a critical value, the system is symmetric and above this value it is asymmetric.

The bottom graph gives the same phenomenon as a function of cavity detunings. For large

values of

oscillation threshold, parametric reconversion occurs and the harmonic intensity decreases

: this is the phenomenon of pump depletion which occurs in standard OPOs. In our case,

the spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs : the fundamental frequency intensities are no

longer equal as is the case in a standard harmonic-pumped OPO or in a non-degenerate

system.

We will now describe the experimental set-up. As mentioned previously, we need to be

able to control independently ∆ and ∆0.

In order to achieve this, we use a dual-cavity

set-up (ﬁg. 3) : this also adds a degree of freedom which allows the veriﬁcation of relation

(5). The intensity reﬂection coeﬃcient are shown in table I. The fundamental frequency

beam is produced by a Nd:YAG laser (λ = 1064 nm, Lightwave 126-1024-700) which is

via the small transmission of the green cavity and we are able to measure independently the

intensities along the crystal neutral axes.

A spontaneous symmetry breaking is observed for certain values of the IR cavity length

(ﬁg. 4). Experimental values of the various parameters governing the system behavior vary

from one recording to the other.

In some recordings, one observes that I2 > I1 (ﬁg. 4,

top), in others that I2 < I1 (B region of ﬁg. 4, bottom). In both cases, one observes pump

depletion as predicted on ﬁg. 2, bottom. Pump depletion is also observed in the region A of

ﬁg. 4, but without symmetry breaking between I1 and I2 : this region of the parameter space

corresponds to the non frequency degenerate operation, which does not lead to symmetry

breaking.

In conclusion, we have developed a dual-cavity set-up which has allowed us to observe

the spontaneous symmetry breaking predicted in intracavity frequency generation with triple

resonance. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst experimental evidence for this behavior.

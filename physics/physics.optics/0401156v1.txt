Abstract: We consider an air-silica honeycomb lattice and demonstrate
a new approach to the formation of a core defect. Typically, a high or
low-index core is formed by adding a high-index region or an additional
air-hole (or other low-index material) to the lattice, but here we discuss how
a core defect can be formed by manipulating the cladding region rather
than the core region itself. Germanium-doping of the honeycomb lattice has
recently been suggested for the formation of a photonic band-gap guiding
silica-core and here we experimentally demonstrate how an index-guiding
silica-core can be formed by ﬂuorine-doping of the honeycomb lattice.

Introduction

In their basic form photonic crystal ﬁbers (PCF) typically consist of fused silica with an ar-
rangement of air-holes running along the full length of the ﬁber (for a recent review we refer
the reader to Ref. [1] and references therein). Traditionally, triangular [2] or honeycomb [3]
cladding arrangements of the air-holes have been considered with the core defect formed by
removing or adding an additional air-hole in the lattice, respectively. This is of course the
most obvious way to form a defect in a regular lattice. However, for the honeycomb lattice
(see Fig. 1) there is at least one alternative approach which involves additional use of index-
altering dopants. Recently, Lægsgaard and Bjarklev [4] suggested how a low-index band-gap
guiding core could be formed in a germanium doped honeycomb lattice by absence of doping
in the core region. Here, we suggest doping by ﬂuorine which results in an index-guiding core.

doped regions indicated by open circles. The perfectly-matched layers employed in ﬁnite-
element simulations are also indicated.

Wavelength [nm]

Fig. 2. Spectral loss measured by a standard white-light cut-back technique. OTDR
measurements at l = 1319 nm and 1550 nm are also indicated by red dots. The measure-
ments are performed with 200 m of ﬁber on a spool with a radius of 8 cm. The left insets
show an optical micrograph of the ﬁber end-facet with the dark circular regions showing
the air holes and the light regions showing the ﬂuorine-doping in the silica background.
The right inset shows a near-ﬁeld image of the fundamental mode at l = 635 nm.

Fluorine-doped PCFs have previously been considered by Mangan et al. [5] who fabricated a
triangular air-hole cladding PCF with a ﬂuorine-doped silica core region. At sufﬁciently short
wavelengths the core index is lower than the effective index of the cladding and the PCF is
anti-guiding, but as the wavelength is increased the effective index of the cladding decreases
and eventually becomes lower than the core index so that light is guided in the core region. In
the present work we use ﬂuorine doping to form a novel large-mode area PCF and the proposed
ﬁber structure may be an alternative to existing large-mode area designs employing a triangular
air-hole arrangement in the cladding [6, 7, 8].

2. Fiber design and fabrication

We consider the structure in Fig. 1 where ﬂuorine doped regions (of diameter d f ) are incor-
porated in a honeycomb lattice of air-holes (of diameter d and nearest-neighbor spacing L
).
The core region is formed by the absence of doping in the central region of the structure. At
sufﬁciently short wavelengths the cladding states will avoid the ﬂuorine-doped regions and the
effective cladding index will in some sense resemble that for a triangular arrangement of holes
whereas at longer wavelengths the ﬁeld averages over the ﬂuorine-doped and pure silica regions
so that the effective index resembles that of a honeycomb lattice (with a slightly down-shifted
background index). The defect region has six-fold rotational symmetry and thus supports a
doubly degenerate fundamental mode [9].

We have fabricated the proposed ﬁber by the stack-and-pull method [2] with hexagonal stack-

ing of ﬂuorine-doped rods (step-index like doping proﬁle) and fused silica tubes and rods. The
inset in Fig. 2 shows an optical micrograph of a typical ﬁber cross section. The ﬁber has an
outer diameter of 175 m m in order to reduce micro-bending deformations at short wavelengths
[10] and it is coated with a standard single layer acrylate coating. The ﬂuorine-doped regions
are of diameter d f /L ∼ 0.7 with an index n f suppressed by d n ∼ 5 × 10−3 relative to the index
ns of silica. The pitch is L ≃ 10.1 m m and the relative air-hole diameter is d/L = 0.64.

3. Fiber characterization

To facilitate coupling of light to the core region a SMF28 was spliced to 200 m of the PCF. The
spectral attenuation was measured by the cut-back technique using a white-light source and an
optical spectrum analyzer. Fig. 2 shows the spectral attenuation of the PCF. Data from OTDR
measurements at l = 1319 nm and 1550 nm are also included and good agreement with the
cut-back data is observed. Cut-back transmission experiments on a short length of PCF have
revealed no signatures of high-order modes.

The ﬁber has a low loss regime at short wavelengths and a regime with high loss above 1000
nm extending to the O-H absorption peak. In order to further analyze the modal properties we
have studied the mode-spacing which can be derived from micro-deformation measurements.
For a detailed description of the method and the interpretation of experimental data we refer
the reader to Ref. [11] and references therein. Fig. 3 shows loss spectra (right axis) for various
periodic micro-deformations and the derived mode-spacings, D n are also included (left axis).
The ﬁgure also includes numerical data calculated with the ﬁnite-element method incorporating

D
perfectly matched layers [12], see Fig. 1. In agreement with the experimental observations, our
simulations also suggest that the PCF is broad-band single mode [13] in the sense that high-
order modes have a negligible spacing (≪ 10−4) to cladding modes.

In order to understand the spacing between guided modes and cladding modes we apply ﬁrst-
order perturbation theory to the guided modes. Treating the absence of ﬂuorine-doping in the
core as a perturbation, de = n2
≃ 2nsd n, we may estimate the shift D n in mode-index with
respect to the cladding modes. From standard perturbation theory (see e.g. Ref. [14]) we get

where c is the velocity of light, E is the unperturbed electrical ﬁeld, and vg is the group velocity.
For a high-order mode the ﬁeld-intensity is strongly suppressed at the center of the core region
[15, 16, 17, 18] and since d f /L
is not too large the mode has a very small overlap with the region
where ﬂuorine is absent. This results in a negligible increase in effective index D n with respect
to the cladding modes. In other words, localization in the core is no big energetic advantage for
the high-order modes. For the fundamental mode the situation is opposite since it has a large
ﬁeld-intensity at the center of the core and indeed we ﬁnd a mode-spacing D n comparable to
d n.

The mode-spacing picture in Fig. 3 suggests that the overall loss has little relation to bending-
induced scattering loss (we have also veriﬁed this by changing the bending radius R) and since
conﬁnement loss can be excluded (we have veriﬁed this numerically) it is likely that the overall
high background originates from various contamination added during the stack-and-pull fabri-
cation process. We believe that the background loss level can be lowered similarly to the recent
achievements in triangular cladding large-mode area PCFs [8].

4. Conclusion

We have studied a new approach to the formation of a core defect in the honeycomb structure
by ﬂuorine-doped regions added to the cladding. At sufﬁciently short wavelengths the cladding
states will avoid the ﬂuorine-doped regions and the effective cladding index will in some sense
resemble that for a triangular arrangement and light will be conﬁned to the core region where
ﬂuorine-doping is absent.

We believe that hybrid cladding designs could be an interesting direction which allows a
higher degree of modal/dispersion engineering and the particular structure studied in this paper
could also be interesting for photonic band-gap ﬁber devices employing liquid crystals [19].

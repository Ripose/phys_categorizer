Reliable control of the deposition process of optical ﬁlms and coatings frequently requires mon-
itoring of the refractive index proﬁle throughout the layer.
In the present work a simple in situ
approach is proposed which uses a WKBJ matrix representation of the optical transfer function of a
single thin ﬁlm on a substrate. Mathematical expressions are developed which represent the minima
and maxima envelopes of the curves transmittance-vs-time and reﬂectance-vs-time. The refractive
index and extinction coeﬃcient depth proﬁles of diﬀerent ﬁlms are calculated from simulated spectra
as well as from experimental data obtained during PECVD of silicon-compound ﬁlms. Variation of
the deposition rate with time is also evaluated from the position of the spectra extrema as a function
of time. The physical and mathematical limitations of the method are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

In optical coatings, two diﬀerent kinds of graded index
proﬁles can occur: (i) intentionally graded proﬁle, when
precisely controlled inhomogeneous optical coatings (for
example, rugate ﬁlters) are produced;1 (ii) accidentally
created inhomogeneities that may arise from the insta-
bility of the deposition process. The latter may be due
to diﬀerent factors,2,3 including the change of microstruc-
ture of the ﬁlm deposited, the contamination, the lack of
control of the fabrication parameters, or the interaction
of the growing ﬁlm with the substrate.

In order to control the ﬁlm quality it is, therefore,
very important to calculate the refractive index depth
proﬁles from in situ measurements. Bovard,4 inspired by
the popular transmittance envelope method for the calcu-
lation of refractive index dispersion curves,5–7 developed
an approximative method based on the transmittance en-
velopes of the curve transmittance-vs-time. In this work,
we describe a generalized reﬂectance and transmittance
envelope method based on WKBJ approximation. A ma-
trix representation of thin ﬁlms with slowly varying index
of refraction is used to obtain maxima and minima enve-
lope expressions, which are then analytically solved and
the refractive index proﬁle is extracted. We apply this
method to evaluate the uniformity of the refractive index
in amorphous hydrogenated silicon nitride (SiN1.3) ﬁlms
deposited in low pressure plasma.

II. EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS

Before we present the theoretical background of our
calculations, we ﬁrst describe the experimental method-

ology for the preparation of optical ﬁlms. The ﬁlms stud-
ied in this work were grown on a radiofrequency (13.56
MHz) -powered electrode (18 cm in diameter) in a plasma
system (Fig. 1) described earlier.8 A mixture of silane and
ammonia (typically 1:3 ratio) was used for the deposition
of SiN1.3 on both glass and silicon wafer substrates, us-
ing a working pressure of 40 mTorr. In order to ease the
optical reﬂectance analysis, the back surface of the glass
substrate was roughened.

During the optical reﬂectance experiment, a white light
beam (100 W halogen lamp, Oriel) hit the surface of
the growing ﬁlm at an angle of incidence close to the
normal. The reﬂected light was collected by an opti-
cal ﬁber and brought to a spectrometer (Multispec I,
Oriel) equipped with a photodiode array (1024 diodes,
Instaspec II, Oriel). The acquisition time of the detector
was kept between 0.3 s (Si substrate) and 0.6 s (glass
substrate). Light from the plasma was recorded as a
background and subtracted from the spectra. Each 4–6
seconds during the deposition, a spectrum was recorded.
Example of reﬂectance data measured in situ with the
optical monitor is shown in Fig. 2. One can see the vari-
ation of the maxima and minima of reﬂectance both with
time and wavelength. A cross section of the spectrum
in Fig. 2(a) is shown in Fig. 2(b), which represents the
variation with time of the reﬂectance at a wavelength of
789 nm.

In addition, ex situ reﬂectance and spectroellipsomet-
ric measurements have been made using a Perkin-Elmer
lambda-19 spectrophotometer and a variable angle spec-
troscopic ellipsometer (VASE, J. A. Woollam Co.), re-
spectively.

III. DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD

A. Refractive index proﬁle

The method used to determine the refractive index of
the ﬁlm at any time of the deposition process is based on
the evaluation of the envelope curves connecting the re-
ﬂectance minima and maxima (dashed lines in Fig. 2(b)).
Following a WKBJ (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeﬀries)
approximation,9 one can express the “optical transfer
function” of an inhomogeneous thin ﬁlm by the following
characteristic matrix:10

where nin and nout are the ﬁlm refractive index values
near the ﬁlm-substrate interface and near the surface, re-
spectively, d is the thickness of the layer, z is the distance
from the interface inside the layer, and n(z) is the refrac-
tive index proﬁle in the layer. From this characteristic
matrix one can obtain expressions for the transmittance
T and reﬂectance R of a ﬁlm on a substrate:

this parameter can have both complex or real values, as
one can consider the reﬂectance problem for both trans-
parent and absorbing substrates. Not surprisingly, the
expressions above are very similar to those describing the
homogeneous case, and they translate very well the fact
that the WKBJ approximation is equivalent to taking
into account only the reﬂections occurring at the inter-
faces in the coatings, while the particular shape of the
refractive index inside the layer is neglected.

From the approximate expressions (2) and (3), one can
obtain expressions for the minima and maxima of the
transmittance or reﬂectance curves, T(z) or R(z). From
the data available (monitored R(z) or T(z) values) one
can then evaluate experimentally the envelopes and solve
the envelopes expressions (such as Eqs. (7) and (8) , see
below) for n(z). However, several assumptions must be
respected: (i) the value of the ﬁlm extinction coeﬃcient is
low (k
n), so that only the k appearing in the exponen-
tial terms is signiﬁcant; (ii) once a material is deposited,
its refractive index value is not altered by the following
deposition on top of it; (iii) the substrate is considered
semi-inﬁnite, which means that the contribution to the
reﬂectance from the back side is negligible.

To illustrate the method with an example, we ap-
plied the above expressions to the envelopes surround-
ing the simulated spectra of a 1-µm-thick transparent
(k = 0) layer with a linear proﬁle and a deposition rate of
60 nm/min (Fig. 3). The proﬁles are expressed as a func-
tion of time instead of distance z, to simulate the type
of data obtained experimentally with an optical moni-
tor. The calculated proﬁle in Fig. 3(b), although clearly
approximate, is in very good agreement with the model
linear proﬁle used in the simulation.

Figure 4 shows the

cient proﬁle is shown in Fig. 4(b). One can see that small
deviations of
(z) from 1 (the value it should have) have
strong impact on the value of the calculated extinction
coeﬃcient, which may reach unexpected negative values.
Therefore, experimental precision of the envelopes must
be very high if one is to ﬁnd reliable k values.

C. Deposition rate and physical position in the layer

It is interesting to express the results in Figs. 3 and 4
as a function of physical position inside the layer instead
of deposition time. When the deposition rate is constant
during the deposition, the transformation of the results
as a function of thickness is obvious. Unfortunately, it
may not be the case for numerous experiments. If the
deposition rate varies during the deposition, one can still
use the fact that the optical thickness between two suc-
cessive extrema is equal to a quarterwave. Using the

d
0 n(z)dz (m is an integer representing
relation mλ/4 =
the interference order) and assuming that the deposition
rate is constant between successive extrema, one obtains
the following relation:

calculated deposition rate around its overall mean value
is negligible and that total thickness found is consistent
with the expected value of 1 µm.

and distance scales can be obtained from t1 = 0 (z1 = 0),
where the ﬁrst extremum occurs. Figure 5(a) shows the
calculated evolution of the deposition rate from the sim-
ulation in Fig. 3. The deposition rate varies around the
expected value (60 nm/min) within an interval of plus
or minus 4 nm/min. One can hence calculate the rela-
tion between the deposition time axis and the distance in

A good estimate of the error in determining the n(z)

the error of Tmax and Tmin are the same and not related,

deposition conditions were deliberately not precisely con-
trolled: as a result, a refractive index gradient in the
layers is observed. The proﬁle in Fig. 6 is realistic; The
variation in n(z) appearing in Fig. 6 may be mostly due
to oxygen contamination by water vapor present in the
earlier stage of the ﬁlm growth. Additionally, n(z) in
Fig. 7 may vary because of unstable deposition parame-
ters, such as oxygen leak. Index variations could also be
due to changes in the microstructure of the layer (varying
porosity). Figures 6(c) and 7(c) show a higher deposition
rate value in the initial stage of the deposition process;
further investigations are on the way to identify further
experimental evidence of these phenomena.

Repeating the calculation for several wavelengths, the
value of the refractive index dispersion at diﬀerent po-
sitions in the layer can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 8.
The distance has been calculated from Eq. (13); the mean
value of the deposition rate has been used (22 nm/min).

Expressions for the error in the envelope reﬂectance
method can be found from the derivation of Eqs. (9)–
(11) as functions of R and nin. The resulting equations
are not shown here, but have been used for the determi-
nation of the error bars in the ﬁgures appearing in this
work (see Figs. 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9). The error on Rmax
and Rmin have been ﬁxed to a value of ∆R = 1% and
corresponds to the experimental error on the measured
extrema. This value doesn’t take into account the error
generated during the calculation of the envelopes.

IV. APPLICATION TO EXPERIMENTAL DATA

The method has been tested experimentally for silicon
nitride ﬁlms deposited on both transparent (glass) and
absorbing (silicon) substrates. The results are shown,
respectively, in Figs. 6 and 7. In these experiments, the

V. DISCUSSION

A. Experimental error

One must be very careful when using an optical mon-
itor for the quasi-continuous measurement of transmit-
tance or reﬂectance with time in a plasma environment.
For measurements at a single wavelength in a glow dis-
charge, use of a lock-in detection system would help to
subtract the light generated by plasma. In our case, with
a photodiode array, such light chopping was not used. In
addition, it was found that the main source of experimen-
tal error was the reﬂection and the scattering of light on
diﬀerent metallic components in the deposition chamber.
Those were suppressed by installing a diaphragm between
the optical monitor and the sample, and by blackening
the surface of the sample holder. Such perturbations will
hardly change the phase information of the signal, but
they can have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the signal amplitude.

B. WKBJ approximation limitations

As pointed out in Sec. III, the matrix representation
in Eq. (1) follows the WKBJ approximation, which holds
when

(18)

The method has been tested on simulated envelopes ob-
tained from a slightly more complex refractive index pro-
ﬁle. Figure 9(a) shows the model proﬁle used and the cal-
culated proﬁle, while Fig. 9(b) shows an evaluation of the
left (solid line) and right (dashed line) part of Eq. (18).
One can see that the relation (18) holds throughout the
proﬁle. Consequently, the WKBJ approximation is valid
for these proﬁles, like it is for the other less complex lin-
ear proﬁles studied in this work.

C. Envelopes-related limitations

Precise determination of the envelopes from experi-
mental spectra is delicate. Algorithms for ﬁnding en-
velopes were developed and are used for the determi-
nation of refractive index dispersion from ex situ spec-
trophotometric measurements.11,12 In these cases, the
spectra and its envelopes are functions of wavelength in-
stead of time or distance, so that limit conditions at the
right and left sides of the spectra can be used in order
to improve the accuracy of the envelope computed. No
such limit conditions exist in our case. Consequently,
simple cubic or linear spline has been chosen to compute
the envelopes. As a result, the left and right extremes
of the spectra are more likely to generate errors in the
calculus. In addition, to increase the accuracy of the en-
velopes, the layer must reach a minimum thickness, so

that the spectra show at least 3 extrema. The value of
this minimum thickness will depend on the index of the
ﬁlm and substrate materials used, and on the wavelength
of the probing light. The shorter the wavelength, the
smaller the minimum thickness will be. Once such min-
imum thickness is reached, the method can be used to
follow, in real time, the evolution of the refractive index
proﬁle during the ﬁlm growth.

D. Change of sign of ζ within the layer

In Sec. III, the sign parameters ǫ, η and ζ can all reach
values of +1 or -1, depending on the diﬀerent values of
the refractive index of the substrate and of the ﬁlm. The
former two are easy to determine, as they depend only on
the values of ns and nin, and do not depend on z. The
latter one (ζ) can be more diﬃcult to determine since
its value depends on nout(z) and is changing along the
proﬁle. Figure 10 illustrates the eﬀect of a change in
the sign of ζ on the refractive index proﬁle: Similarly
to Fig. 3, a linear proﬁle (dashed line) has been used to
simulate the variation with time of the reﬂectance during
the deposition of the graded layer. The envelope method
developed above has been used to calculate the refrac-
tive index proﬁle twice, i.e. with ζ value of +1 and -1,
respectively. Around t
7 min., the variation of rout,
Rmin and Rmax is such that the value of ζ in Eq. (10)
should be changed from -1 to +1 in order to calculate an
accurate refractive index proﬁle.

E. Ex situ analysis

For comparison additional ex situ spectrophotomet-
ric and spectroellipsometric analysis of samples from
Sec. IV have been performed. Using the n(z) proﬁle
for SiN1.3 layer on glass calculated with the envelope
method (Fig. 6), cutting this proﬁle in small sublayers,
and introducing a small n(λ) dispersion, it was found
that the reﬂectance calculated from this proﬁle repro-
duce well the ex situ measured reﬂectance (Fig. 11(b))
and the in situ measured reﬂectance (Fig. 11(c)). In ad-
dition, a simple model considering a single homogeneous
layer (dotted line in Fig. 11(a)) has been used to repro-
duce more precisely the ex situ reﬂectance (Fig. 11(b)); it
was found that this model gives almost the same in situ
reﬂectance variation with time (Fig. 11(c)) as the graded
proﬁle (solid line in Fig. 11(a)). However, the ex situ
spectra provide very little information about the exact
index proﬁle; in fact, diﬀerent changes in the thickness
and the n(z) values of the graded proﬁle in Fig. 11(a)
could also result in a good match with the ex situ data
in Fig. 11(b). Therefore, ex situ measurements do not
oﬀer enough reliable informations about the real proﬁle
n(z). Ex situ spectroellipsometric measurements led to
the same observations. One can conclude that: (i) ex

situ analysis can give a false impression of homogeneity,
due to the fact that several diﬀerent models can ﬁt ex
situ data (there are several local minima of the merit
function used in the ﬁtting procedure); (ii) in situ anal-
ysis using the envelope method proposed in this work
avoids ﬁtting problems, but small errors in the exper-
imental data can lead to large uncertainties in the n(z)
and k(z) proﬁles. The advantage of in situ measurements
is clear (“it’s easier to investigate a murder if you can see
it in situ”13), but ﬁnding n(z) very precisely requires very
sensitive measurements.

VI. CONCLUSION

An envelope method has been developed for the de-
termination of refractive index proﬁle n(z) from in situ
spectrophotometric measurements (reﬂectance or trans-
mittance). The method is based on the WKBJ approxi-
mation valid for slowly varying refractive index proﬁles.
Generalized analytical expressions, suitable for high or
low index substrates, are given for the calculation of n(z)
from in situ transmittance measurements. A more gener-
alized solution, valid also for non-transparent substrates
was calculated and it is used for the determination of
n(z) from in situ reﬂectance measurements. The instan-
taneous deposition rate and its variation during the depo-
sition process are derived from the calculated n(z) proﬁle.
The main feature of the envelope method developed in
this work is its analytical character: Unlike usual in situ
spectrophotometric and ellipsometric analysis, no non-
linear ﬁt algorithms or “initial guess” of the refractive
index has to be used in order to ascertain n(z). In fact,
the simplicity of this envelope method makes it attractive
for rapid ﬁrst approximation analysis to generate initial
data for more sophisticated methods such as in situ el-
lipsometry.

Abstract: We study nonlinear coupling of mutually incoherent beams
associated with different Floquet-Bloch waves in a one-dimensional
optically-induced photonic lattice. We demonstrate experimentally how
such interactions lead to asymmetric mutual focusing and, for waves
with opposite diffraction properties, to simultaneous focusing and defocus-
ing as well as discreteness-induced beam localization and reshaping effects.

Introduction

Light propagation in nonlinear media is associated with many important phenomena includ-
ing optical rectiﬁcation, harmonic generation, self-focusing, and soliton formation. Coupling
of two or more optical waves mediated by a nonlinear material is responsible for four-wave
mixing, parametric generation and ampliﬁcation, as well as cross phase modulation and cross
coupling. Mutual beam focusing involves both self-focusing and cross phase modulation of
co-propagating beams and is an important effect with potential for all-optical light control and
switching applications. Mutual beam focusing is also a fundamental phenomenon responsible
for the formation of vector optical solitons in homogeneous dielectric media [1].

Periodicity of the medium adds to the diversity of effects associated with nonlinear light
propagation. In a material with a periodic modulation of the refractive index, the linear trans-
mission spectrum becomes subject to dramatic modiﬁcations such as for instance the ap-
pearence of bandgaps, and the light propagation displays many new features that are governed
by the properties of the extended eigenmodes of the periodic structure, the Floquet-Bloch
waves. For example, beams associated with different Floquet-Bloch modes possess different
diffraction properties, and this leads to normal, zero, and even anomalous diffraction in the
same material [2]. Furthermore, the bandgap spectrum of a periodic medium strongly affects
nonlinear propagation and localization of light in the form of spatial solitons [1]. Different types
of such self-trapped optical wavepackets have been demonstrated experimentally in nonlinear
periodic structures, including discrete (or lattice) solitons in the semi-inﬁnite total internal re-
ﬂection gap [3, 4, 5], and spatial gap solitons in the Bragg reﬂection gaps [4, 6, 7, 8]. Vector
solitons consisting of mutually coupled components localized in different gaps have been pre-
dicted theoretically [9, 10, 11, 12]. Most recently, it was demonstrated experimentally that par-
tially coherent beams can excite modes in several gaps that experience mutual trapping in media
with slow photorefractive nonlinearity [13]. Mutual focusing of orthogonally polarized waves
excited in different bands, as well as formation of single-polarization multi-band breathers, has
been observed in AlGaAs waveguide array structures [14, 15].

In this work, we study experimentally nonlinear interactions of mutually incoherent beams
associated with different Floquet-Bloch modes of an optically-induced photonic lattice with
self-focusing nonlinearity. The setup was designed to allow for simultaneous excitation of
waves associated with the edges of the ﬁrst and second transmission bands, and for independent
control over the beam widths and amplitudes. Such ﬂexibility enabled us to reveal novel effects
for nonlinear beam propagation regimes that were not accessed in other experimental studies
of interband mutual focusing [13, 14, 15]. In particular, we demonstrate an inherent modal
asymmetry in the effect of discrete mutual focusing of beams generated at the upper edges of
the ﬁrst two transmission bands. We observe transitional mutual focusing and defocusing of
waves exhibiting diffraction of different magnitude and sign, and study in detail discrete beam
break-up induced by highly localized ﬁelds. The results allow for generalization of symbiotic
type interactions in periodic media, as predicted for pulses with different dispersion in optical
ﬁbres [16, 17, 18]

We consider a one-dimensional lattice induced optically in a photorefractive crystal with
strong electro-optic anisotropy, as ﬁrst suggested theoretically by Efremidis et al. [19]. Propa-
gation of several mutually incoherent beams in such a lattice is described by a system of coupled

nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations for the normalized beam envelopes En(x, z),

the beam diffraction coefﬁcient, n0 is the average refractive index of the medium, and l 0

interference pattern which induces a lattice with period d, and g
is a nonlinear coefﬁcient pro-
portional to the applied DC ﬁeld [4, 5]. To match our experimental conditions, we use the
following parameters: l 0 = 0.532 m m, n0 = 2.35, x0 = 1 m m, z0 = 1mm, d = 19.2, Ib = 1 and
Ig = 1. Then, the refractive index contrast in the lattice is D n = gl /(4p z0), which evaluates to
1 · 10−4 for g = 2.36. The crystal length is L = 15 mm.

2. Experimental setup
We create an optical lattice with a period of 19.2 m m inside a 15 × 5 × 5 mm SBN:60 crystal
by interfering two ordinarily-polarized broad laser beams from a frequency-doubled Nd:YVO4
laser at 532 nm. Applying an external electric ﬁeld of 1.8 − 2.0 kV then produces a periodic
refractive index modulation whose saturation is controlled by homogeneously illuminating the
crystal with white light. The induced lattice gives rise to a linear transmission spectrum with
bandgaps as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). Extraordinarily-polarized probe beams from the same laser
source are focused onto the front face of the crystal and launched into the lattice in a way as
to selectively excite Bloch waves associated with the edges of the bandgaps. The eigenmode
proﬁles at the gap edges are shown in Fig. 1(b) along with the corresponding refractive index
modulation (shaded).

In order to excite the speciﬁc Bloch waves, we use a multiple-beam technique, schemati-
cally shown in Fig. 1(c). To obtain pure excitation of a given Bloch wave, the input beam must
approximate the eigenmode proﬁle by matching its leading-order Fourier component [Fig. 1(b-
dashed line)]. Hence, a single Gaussian beam [Fig. 1(d-middle)] is used to excite the funda-
mental wave at the top of the ﬁrst band (i.e. at the edge of the total internal reﬂection gap)
[5], and two overlapping coherent beams, both inclined at the Bragg angle, are used to excite
Bloch waves with a staggered phase structure at the two edges of the Bragg reﬂection gap [8].

b
Aligning the maxima of the lattice and the two-beam interference proﬁle [Fig. 1(d-bottom)],
we obtain pure excitation of the Bloch mode at the bottom of the ﬁrst band. Shifting the probe
beam position by half a period leads to a pure excitation of the mode at the top of the second
band. The beams 1 and 2 in Fig. 1(c) are made mutually incoherent by reﬂecting beam 1 from a
piezo-transducer controlled mirror vibrating at high frequency. All excited Bloch waves prop-
agate straight down the lattice with zero transverse velocity, in case of the staggered modes
thanks to an exact power balance between the two inclined input beams. At the crystal output,
the near-ﬁeld intensity distribution of the propagated beams is imaged onto a CCD camera.

3. Discrete interband mutual focusing

We ﬁrst study discrete interband mutual coupling of two beams associated with the top of
the ﬁrst and the second band. Both exhibit normal diffraction and can therefore be localized at
higher powers by the self-focusing nonlinearity. This leads to the effect of mutual focusing since
each beam is capable of inducing a local defect (waveguide) that traps the other component.
Mutual focusing can occur for a wide range of different relative and absolute beam powers.
Here we investigate the extreme cases in which the beam powers are strongly imbalanced, and
where the coupling effects are therefore most easily observed. We initially set the power of
both beams at a low (nW) level so that they propagate in a linear regime. Then the power of
one of the components is increased and the nonlinear effect on both beams is studied. Unless
otherwise stated, the two probe beams have an input full width at half maximum (FWHM) of
17 ± 3 m m and 70 ± 3 m m, respectively.

Figure 2 shows the result of increasing the power of the fundamental ﬁrst band beam (brown).
Transition from discrete diffraction of this beam in the linear regime [Fig. 2(a)] to discrete
focusing at higher power [Fig. 2(b)] is accompanied by a decrease in the FWHM of the broader
co-propagating second-band beam by almost a factor of two. The second-band beam width is
estimated by a Gaussian envelope ﬁtting, whereas the width of the ﬁrst-band beam is described
by its discrete second-order central moment w2 = (cid:229) 2|n|d2P(n)/ (cid:229) P(n), where 2n + 1 is the
number of spanned lattice sites, d is the lattice period, and P(n) is the intensity of the nth site.
We calculate w2 for the three central lattice sites (n = 1) and characterize the beam width by 2w.
To investigate the effect in further detail, we measure the degree of focusing of both components
as a function of the ﬁrst-band beam power. The result is shown in Fig. 2(c), and we notice that

m
the width of the passive second-band beam asymptotically shrinks from ∼ 180m m to ∼ 90m m,
whereas the effect is rather small for the ﬁrst-band beam itself.

of the 1st band (brown) and top of the 2nd band (orange). (a) Both components at low power.
(b) 2nd -band beam at high power (900 nW) and 1st -band beam at low power (100 nW). (c)
Two-dimensional visualization of output proﬁles for increasing 2nd -band power.

Simultaneous beam focusing is also observed if, conversely, the power of the ﬁrst-band com-
ponent is maintained at a low level and that of the second band beam is increased [Fig. 3].
Since the defect induced by the high-power second-band beam is rather broad and weak, we
observe less pronounced focusing of the ﬁrst-band beam in this case. In fact, it was necessary
to slightly increase the input beam width to 20 m m in order to reduce diffraction and thereby
facilitate focusing, and that is why no clear discrete diffraction is observed for linear propaga-
tion of the ﬁrst-band beam in Fig. 3(a). Figure 3(c) maps the beam proﬁles as a function of the
second-band beam power in a two-dimensional plot.

Together the above results demonstrate discrete interband mutual focusing of mutually inco-
herent beams, an effect responsible for the formation of multi-gap vector solitons. The observed
asymmetry in the strength of the coupling between the bands reﬂects the fact that the physics of
the discrete total internal reﬂection and Bragg gap solitons associated with the involved Bloch
waves is quite different. Indeed, a discrete soliton in the total internal reﬂection gap creates a
narrow and strongly localized defect, whereas both the minimum width and the maximum in-
tensity of a Bragg gap soliton are limited due to the ﬁnite spectral width of the Bragg reﬂection
gap. This means that there is also a limit for the trapping strength of the self-induced second-
band defect. The above-mentioned generic features may well account for the saturation of the
second band mode focusing [Fig. 2(c)], and the observed interband coupling asymmetry, i.e.
the fact that the two beams are not equally capable of trapping each other.

4.

Interaction of beams with normal and anomalous diffraction

Next we study intraband coupling effects for the two modes at the top and the bottom of the
ﬁrst band. These waves exhibit normal and anomalous diffraction, respectively, and therefore
the ﬁrst self-focuses while the second experiences defocusing in the self-focusing nonlinear-
ity. However, the picture is more complicated when the two waves interact via the nonlinear
medium. We show that in this case mutual coupling can lead to simultaneous focusing and de-
focusing and to interesting discrete localization effects. Indeed, when the power of the beam
associated with the bottom of the band is increased [Fig. 4] it does spread out stronger due to
self-defocusing (blue). However, it still induces a lattice defect that causes the mode at the top
of the band (brown) to focus. This is to our knowledge a ﬁrst demonstration of simultaneous
mutual focusing and defocusing of beams belonging to different parts of the bandgap spectrum.

Figure 4(c) shows that the beam widths increase and decrease almost linearly as a function
of the power of the beam at the top of the band. We would like to point out that whereas the
interband mutual focusing can lead to the formation of stable multi-gap vector solitons, the
intra-band coupling effects responsible for the observed simultaneous focusing and defocusing
[Fig. 4] are inherently transient in nature since at longer propagation distances, the two beams
will eventually decouple from each other. However, soliton formation is not in general required
for obtaining e.g. all-optical switching, and even spatially transient effects may be sufﬁcient for
achieving effective beam manipulation functionalities.

In the opposite case [see Fig. 5], the beam at the top of the band self-focuses at high powers,
but induces a repelling defect for the defocusing beam at the bottom of the band. We observe
that as the power of the fundamental beam is increased [movie in Fig. 5(c)] the power carried
by the two lattice sites (index maxima) next to the central one drops signiﬁcantly at the crystal
output. Eventually, at high power, the output proﬁle is composed of a single centrally localized
peak and two discretely repelled outer lobes. Clearly, this complex beam reshaping cannot be
described by a simple envelope approximation and calls for further investigations.

5. Numerical simulations

To support our experimental results and to more closely examine the features associated with
discrete localization and beam shaping effects for waves with opposite diffraction properties, a
series of extended numerical simulations were performed. They conﬁrmed all important aspects
of our experimental observations, including the asymmetric interband coupling, the transitional
mutual focusing and defocusing, and the discreteness-induced reshaping of the anomalously
diffracting ﬁrst-band beam. Fig. 6 shows two examples of simulations representing the experi-
mental cases of mutual interband focusing in Fig. 2 and ﬁrst band focusing-defocusing interac-
tions in Fig. 5. The simulated propagation distance corresponds to the length of our crystal.

Fig. 6. Beam propagation method simulations of interband focusing (left) and interaction of
focusing and defocusing 1st -band beams (right). The plot windows are 320 m m and 15 mm
in the horizontal (transverse) and vertical (propagation) directions, respectively. In (a,b) and
(c,d) two beams co-propagate at low power and experience diffraction. In (e,f) the power
of the beam at the top of the 1st band is increased, causing focusing of this beam and the
low power 2nd -band beam. In (g,h) interaction between a high power fundamental beam
and a low power beam at the bottom of the 1st band results in the formation of a complex
beating pattern and the appearance of a localized discrete central peak and two diffracting
outer lobes.

The ﬁrst case [Fig. 6, left] presents a pair consisting of a fundamental and a second band
beam which both experience diffraction broadening at low power (top panels) and then focus
as the power of the ﬁrst band component is increased (bottom panels). Figure 6 (right) shows a
pair of beams with opposite dispersion from the top and bottom of the ﬁrst band. At low power,
both components propagate linearly and diffract. At high power, the fundamental mode (top of
the band) self-focuses and induces a local lattice defect, which results in a complex propaga-
tion pattern for the anomalously diffracting wave at the bottom of the band. First, power seems
to oscillate back and forth between the central lattice site and its two adjacent neighbours, in-
dicating a beating between modes with different propagation constants. Then, a central peak
and two clearly decoupled outer lobes eventually appear, as observed experimentally. Simu-
lations for extended propagation distances (not shown) revealed that after about 50% longer
propagation the oscillatory behavior ceases, and the decoupled power propagates away from
the defect in two distinct lobes at the zero diffraction angles. Interestingly, a considerable part
of the power stays trapped in the induced defect and propagates straight down the lattice as a
stable waveguide mode. In all simulations the FWHM of the fundamental and the Bragg input
beams was 15 m m and 70 m m, respectively, and the peak power of the fundamental ﬁrst-band
beam (normalized to a constant dark irradiance Ib) was 0.25 and 3.24 in Figs. 6 (e,f) and (g,h),
respectively.

6. Conclusions

In conclusion, we have studied interaction of mutually incoherent beams associated with
Floquet-Bloch waves from different spectral bands. We have demonstrated experimentally how
defects induced by nonlinear propagation can trap and guide beams from several bands, lead-
ing to the effect of discrete interband mutual focusing. This is a key physical mechanism for
generation of multi-gap solitons with components originating from different spectral bands.
We have observed a fundamental asymmetry in the interband mutual focusing effect due to
the generically different physics of the involved Bloch waves. We also demonstrated an inter-
play between waves with diffraction coefﬁcients of opposite sign that leads to generation of
anti-waveguiding defects, complex beam reshaping and simultaneous focusing and defocusing
within the ﬁrst transmission band.

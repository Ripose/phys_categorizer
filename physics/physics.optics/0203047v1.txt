Fundamental rules and deﬁnitions of Fractional Diﬀerintegrals are outlined. Factorizing
1-D and 2-D Helmholtz equations four semi-diﬀerential eigenfunctions are determined. The
functions exhibit incident and reﬂected plane waves as well as diﬀracted incident and reﬂected
waves on the half-plane edge. They allow to construct the Sommerfeld half-plane diﬀraction
solutions. Parabolic-Wave Equation (PWE, Leontovich-Fock) for paraxial propagation is fac-
torized and diﬀerential fractional solutions of Fresnel-integral type are determined. We arrived
at two solutions, which are the mothers of known and new solutions.

Introduction

The mathematical theory of the fractional calculus and the theory of ordinary frac-
tional diﬀerential equations is well developed and there is a vast literature on the subject
[1], [2], [3], [4], [5] and [6]. The theory of partial fractional diﬀerential equations is a
recently investigated problem and the theory mainly concerns fractional diﬀusion-wave
equations [7], [8], [9], [10] and [11].

The main objectives of this paper is a factorization of the Helmholtz equation to ob-
tain four semidiﬀerential eigenfunctions allowing to construct the well known half-plain
diﬀraction problem. Factorizing the Leontovich-Fock equation, we determine semidiﬀer-
ential Green functions, which allow to ﬁnd paraxial solutions for a given beam boundary
conditions.

The article is organized as follows. In Sec.2, we quote the required rules for fractional
diﬀerintegrals and four fundamental deﬁnitions of fractionals. Section 3 is devoted
to a factorization of ordinary diﬀerential equations and determinations of fractional
eigenfunctions. Section 4 and 5 constitute the main body of our paper and contain
derivations of fractional eigenmodes for the Helmholtz equation and fractional solutions
of Leontovich-Fock equation. The ﬁnal section is devoted to comments and conclusions.

2 Main Rules and Deﬁnitions of Fractional Diﬀerintegrals

Integration and diﬀerentiation to an arbitrary order named fractional calculus has a
long history, see[1], [3]. In the background of the fractional operations, we see general-
ization of integer order calculus to a noninteger order, class of diﬀerintegrable functions
and applications of the calculus. We recall required rules of fractional diﬀerintegral
calculus. For simplicity, at present let us assume that the considered functions are real
and diﬀerintegrals are of real order and are related ti the interval of real axis from c to

The deﬁnition of fractional diﬀerintegrals due to Gr¨unwald and Letnikov is the most
fundamental in that it involves the fewest restrictions on the functions to which it is
applied and avoids the explicit use of notations of the ordinary derivative and integral.
The deﬁnition uniﬁes two notions, which are usually presented separately in classical
analysis; the derivative and integral (diﬀerintegral). It is valid for a q-th order derivative
or (-q)-th folded integrals whether or not q is a real integer. Thus the diﬀerintegral of

where h = (x

deﬁning n-th order derivative, which contains n terms in nominator and n-th power of
h in denominator. The number of terms tends to inﬁnity for noninteger q in the nomina-
tor and q-th power of h in the denominator. Just like in the case of binomial formula for
the positive integer power (a + b)n and for negative power as well as noninteger power
(a + b)q. The convergence is a critical point but the formula (2.1) is very convenient for
computations. The deﬁnition is equivalent to the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral:

The deﬁnitions stem from consideration of Cauchy’s integral formula and are very
convenient to implement but require observation of convergence of the integrals. Nev-
ertheless, because of their convenient formulations in terms of a single integrations they
enjoy great popularity as working deﬁnitions. They play an important role in the devel-
opment of the theory of diﬀerintegrals and for their applications in pure mathematics-
solutions of noninteger order diﬀerential equations, deﬁnitions of new function classes,
summation of series, etc. In this paper, we do apply the these deﬁnitions in spite of
some ambiguity in respect to consistency and additivity rules. However, the demands of

modern applications require deﬁnitions of fractional derivatives allowing the utilization
of physically interpretable initial conditions, which contain classical initial conditions for
functions and their integer derivatives at the initial point. Unfortunately, the Riemann-
Liouville approach leads to initial conditions containing fractional derivatives at the
lower limit of integrals. A certain solution to this conﬂict was proposed by M. Caputo
[4], whose deﬁnition is as follows:

For the purpose of applications to fractional diﬀerential equations, we introduce the

Miller-Ross sequential fractional derivatives. The main idea is based on the relation:

and the simplest fractional equation of order O(N, q) takes the form:

q and the adequate initial conditions for fractional derivatives, see [3] and

We shall call (2.4) the fractional linear diﬀerential equation with constant coeﬃ-
cients of the order (N, q), where q is the least common multiple of the denominators
of the nonzero αj = jv. The solution to the equation can be found by use of Laplace
transformations. We know that N -th order linear diﬀerential equation has N linearly
independent solutions.
In [3], it is shown how to construct linearly independent N -
solutions of homogeneous fractional diﬀerential equations.

3 Factorization and Eigenfunctions of an ODE

An eigenfunction y(ξ) of the linear operator L[y(ξ)] is such a function that the repeated
operations preserve the function, e.g. L[y(ξ)] = Cy with the exactness to a multi-
plicative constant C.
In the case of fractional operation, the deﬁnition is extended
to preservation of the function but an additive constant or a term of power of ξ, e.g.
(πξ)−
Consider the following ODE:

Substituting the two last terms into (4,1), the following terms;
appear on the right hand side of the equation, respectively. The power terms are the
consequences of the accepted deﬁnition of fractal derivatives and in the considered
case the consistency and additivity rules are not completely preserved. We withhold a
discussion of any interpretation of the derived fractional modes. But for two-dimensional
problems we demonstrate a method to remove the ambiguity as the problems have a
pronounce physical meaning. In the case of the 2-D Helmholtz equation:

it is found, that

∆x,yΦ(x, y) + k2Φ(x, y) = 0,

Introducing an analytical function; f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) with possible singularity at
z = x + iy = 0, we note, that (4.5) is the real part of the following equation:

One may speculate, that a fractional Laplacian operator:

has fractional eigenfunctions represented by two last terms of (4.8) and the operator
is related to half-plane (x, y) and exhibits half-plan edge waves. Fractional Laplacian
operations may concern 2-D surfaces, like circle, ring, holes in plane, etc., and they are
concerned with respective edge waves.

formulation of the boundary value problem. In the contrast to the elliptic Helmholtz
equation, the Schr¨odinger type parabolic wave equations (paraxial-wave equation) de-
scribes the evolution of the wave amplitude in process of almost unidirectional propaga-
tion along the optical axis. Physically, it means neglecting the backward reﬂections from
the interfaces and an inaccurate description of the waves diﬀracted into large oﬀ-axis
angles. This approximate approach ﬁnds a wide spectrum of applications in radio wave
propagation, underwater acoustics, linear laser beam propagation and X-ray imaging
optics, see [13], [14], [15], [16] and [17]. A variety of its modiﬁcation has been used in
the diﬀraction theory, nonlinear optics and plasmas, see [18], [19], [20], [21], [22] and
[23].

For the parabolic equation, the Cauchy problem with the given initial distribution
u(x, y, 0) = u0(x, y) (named also one-point boundary value) is correctly posed if some
radiation condition is added excluding spurious waves coming from inﬁnity.

Considering the two cases; (2+1)D and (1+1)D, we neglect the inhomogeneity of

the dielectric permeability α ≈ 0, and write the two following equations:

((5.3))

((5.4))

2ik∂zu + ∆x,yu = 0.

2ik∂zu + ∂x,xu = 0.

Next, we factorize the equation(5.4) to obtain:

It is easy to check that (5.7) satisﬁes (5.4) and its ﬁrst as well as higher derivatives with

separation, we can write the mother of solutions for (2+1)D equation (5.3) in the form:

which is related to fractional Laplacian with respect to a certain region of plane (x, y).
It will cause no confusion if we use the same notation u to designate diﬀerent solutions
of (5.3) and (5.4). The derivatives ∂m
y of (5.8), where m and n are natural numbers,
satisfy the PWE and may be related to higher order Gaussian-Hermite optical beams.
Let us calculate the derivative ∂x∂y of (5.8) to derive classical paraxial Green func-

It is well known that, in the problem of diﬀraction by plane screens (e.g. a thin
zone plate), the parabolic approximation is equivalent to the simpliﬁed Fresnel-Kirchoﬀ
diﬀraction theory. In fact, any solution of (5.3) can be expressed for z > 0 in terms of
its one-point boundary value (initial value) over an aperture. Assuming the one-point
boundary condition over the plane (x, y):

By inspection or simple reasoning one can see that they satisfy (5.3). In view of the
convolution properties of (5.9), we can diﬀerentiate functions u0(x, y) or G(x, y, z) to
obtain the same result

By a symmetry of (5.3), we ﬁnd that the equation can be reduced to (1+1)D equation

it seems that the exhibited mother solutions for PWE exhaust all possibilities.

We now give an example of the Fresnel solution to the following nonhomogeneous

In principle, the number of eigenfunctions of the diﬀerential Laplace operator can be
arbitrary. According to factorization and a choice of D1/n = a, the candidate number
is n for the Laplacian. In the case of 1-D and 2-D, we derive 4 semi-diﬀerential modes.
The 2-D Laplacian ∆x,y possesses two additional eigenfunctions of the form;

where the lower limit of Fresnel integral u(x, y) is to satisfy the set of characteristic
equations, see (4.5), for the half plane x, y
). It is important to note, that the
modes are related to a half-plane, like fractional derivatives are related to an interval.
We recall, as an example, that the fractional derivative of order q of the exponential
function eλx related to a half-axis is a Mittag-Leﬄer function but for the whole axis it is
the same function multiplied by λ to power q; λqeλx. We do withhold, throughout the

paper,
from deﬁning fractional Laplacian operator although we determine the eigen-
function of the operator related to half-plane, strip and circle. There is an expectation,
that the right deﬁnition must be based on an integral of the Fresnel-Kirchoﬀ type and
relation to the n-dimensional region, where n is a number of independent variables. One
may speculate, on the ground of Riemann-Liouville deﬁnition, that it may be a two-
folded convolution integral with respect to x and y such that a Laplace transform with
respect to the variables gives an anticipated results like in the case of single variable
functions. Also, one may hope, that the Gr¨unwald-Letnikov deﬁnition may be extended
for the fractional operators. A separate paper will be devoted to existence, uniqueness
and deﬁnitions of fractional Laplacian operators. Here considered operators come out
from factorizations and lead to results, which satisfy the classical Laplacian. It is not a
necessary condition for the fractional operators.

We also mention the 3-D Helmholtz equation but for that problem there is no ex-
pected solution. We do not know the 3-D region, like in the case of half-plane diﬀraction,
for which there is an exact solution (eigenfunctions). The solution derived by variable
separation (a method reducing the 3-D problem to two dimensions) is not applicable to
the our requirement.

Consideration of Leontovich-Fock equation is justiﬁed not only by its numerous
applications but to show that the equation is factorable and the fractional equations lead
to the mother of solutions. The mother is a function of the Fresnel integral satisfying
PWE, vanishing at z = 0 and her derivatives ∂m
x also satisfy PWE. The notion is not
trivial as there is expectation that the mother solutions and their derivatives generate
all possible symmetries of on-axis and oﬀ-axis beams in the case of homogeneous PWE.
The last solution (5.14) of nonhomogeneous equation (5.13) is an illustration of paraxial
beam of the Fresnel type.

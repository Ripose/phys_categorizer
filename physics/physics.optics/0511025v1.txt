Abstract

A homogeneously broadened unidirectonal ring laser can emit in several longitudinal
modes for large enough pump and cavity length because of Rabi splitting induced
gain. This is the so called Risken-Nummedal–Graham-Haken (RNGH) instability.
We investigate numerically the properties of the multi–mode solution. We show
that this solution can coexist with the single–mode one, and its stability domain
can extend to pump values smaller than the critical pump of the RNGH instability.
Morevoer, we show that the multi–mode solution for large pump values is aﬀected
by two diﬀerent instabilities: a pitchfork bifurcation, which preserves phase–locking,
and a Hopf bifurcation, which destroys it.

The Risken-Nummedal–Graham-Haken (RNGH) instability was ﬁrst described
in two independent papers in 1968 [1,2]. In short, the instability consists in the
destabilization of single longitudinal–mode emission, which appears immedi-
ately above the lasing threshold in a single transverse–mode homogeneously–
broadened unidirectional ring laser, in favor of multilongitudinal mode emis-
sion. The physical mechanism responsible for that instability is the Rabi split-

ting of the lasing transition, induced by the lasing mode, which leads to the
appearance of gain for the sideband modes [3,4,5].

After the instability, the laser emits in a pulsing regime because of the beat-
ing between diﬀerent longitudinal modes, which are phase–locked. It is to
be emphasized that no inhomogeneity, nor spectral nor spatial, is needed for
multi–mode emission. For a recent review of the RNGH instability, see [6] and
references therein.

Although some analytical work can be done regarding what happens after the
instability occurs, it is evident that the multi–mode emission regime needs
to be analyzed numerically. The situation is similar to that of the Lorenz–
Haken (LH) instability, which is the single–mode counterpart of the RNGH
instability. However, while the dynamics associated with the LH instability has
been completely and since a long time characterized through a large number
of numerical studies [7,8], a lot of work has still to be done to achieve the same
degree of knowledge for the RNGH instability.

The ﬁrst numerical study about the dynamics associated with the RNGH
instability was carried out by Risken and Nummedal themselves [9] but since
then, along almost forty years, only a few works have been devoted to that
[3,10,11,12,13,14]. It must also be noted that some of these studies are quite
superﬁcial as they were intended to show some examples of the pulsing regime
rather than characterizing it.

An important aspect of the RNGH instability is the supercritical or subcrit-
ical character of the bifurcation. We remind that if the pump parameter A
is the control parameter and Ai is the pump value at which the single–mode
solution destabilizes (also known as the second laser threshold), the bifurca-
tion is supercritical if the multi–mode solution that arises from the instability
exists only for A > Ai, and it is subcritical if it exists also for A < Ai. In
the latter case, the multi–mode solution will coexist with the stable single–
mode solution in the interval Asub
Ai, where Asub must be in general
A
determined numerically. This region of the parameter space is called hard
excitation domain, because within that domain a large perturbation of the
stable single–mode solution allows to make the transition to the multi–mode
solution.

The understanding of this question may be important for the correct inter-
pretation of the experimental results recently obtained in erbium–doped ﬁber
lasers (EDFLs) [15,16,17,18] (see also [6]). In fact, if the bifurcation is subcrit-
ical the self–pulsing regime may be observed experimentally for pump values
smaller than the instability threshold Ai given by the linear stability analysis of
the single–mode solution, and the transition from cw emission to self–pulsing
would be discontinuous.

A, α

For the RNGH instability the instability domain is usually represented in
plane, where α is the properly scaled side–mode frequency. The
the
instability domain has the shape of a tongue delimited by the curves α− and
α+, which merge at the critical point (Ac, αc) (see Fig. 1). αc is the critical
frequency at which the instability threshold Ai attains its minimum value Ac.
The single–mode solution is unstable if, for a given pump A, there is at least
one side–mode whose frequency α lies inside the tongue.

A number of numerical and analytical studies have shown that the multi–mode
solution exists not only inside the instability domain, but also for α < α−
and A > Ac, where the linear stability analysis predicts stable single–mode
emission.

This result was found numerically already by Risken and Nummedal in their
second paper of 1968 [9]. They showed that, ﬁxing A > Ac and decreasing α
from an initial value larger than α+, the single–mode solution bifurcates to
the multi–mode solution at α+ and this solution persists even when the other
boundary α− is crossed. Risken and Nummedal were not able to determine the
lower boundary of the existence domain of the multi–mode solution, because
the numerical analysis of that solution is problematic for small α. In fact, as α
decreases the pulses becomes higher and narrower and in order to reproduce
them correctly a very small spatial stepsize is needed, which implies increasing
computation time.

Later on, Haken and Ohno [19,20,21] derived a generalized Ginzburg–Landau

equation for the critical (unstable) mode and found again the coexistence of
the two solutions, which are the minima of an eﬀective potential. They also
showed that the transition from single–mode to multi–mode emission can be
supercritical or subcritical depending on the frequency α, but they did not
write an analytic expression of this result.

Simpler analytic results can be found considering some particular limits for
the parameters γ =
γk/γ⊥ and σ = κ/√γkγ⊥, where κ, γ⊥ and γk are the
decay rates of electric ﬁeld, medium polarization and population inversion.

In the limit of class–B lasers (γ
1), for which Ac = 9, Fu [22]
derived analytically an unambiguous condition: If the pump parameter A is
the bifurcation parameter, the bifurcation is supercritical (subcritical) when
α > αc (α < αc). This result has been recently generalized for conditions
outside the uniform ﬁeld limit [6]. The same result was found by Carr and
Erneux in a slightly diﬀerent limit for class–B lasers (γ

1) [23].

All these results mean that multi–mode emission can be found for parameter
settings for which the single–mode solution is still stable. Nevertheless, the
minimum instability threshold pump Ac = 9 has been always found to be a
lower bound for multi–mode emission. In general, the condition that deter-
mines sub– or supercritical bifurcation is not known, and it remains to be
determined whether the multi–mode solution can exist not only for α < α−,
but also for A < Ac outside the class–B limit.

In this paper we address this question and show that, outside the class B–limit,
the multi–mode solution can indeed exist for A < Ac although not below the
limit A = 9. Moreover, we perform an accurate study of the multi–mode
solution and show that, increasing the pump power A for a ﬁxed frequency α,
the solution is aﬀected by two instabilities in sequence. The ﬁrst is a pitchfork
instability, which breaks the symmetry of the solution, but preserves phase–
locking. The second is a Hopf instability, which unlock the phases, introducing
a slow modulation of the pulses.

In Section 2 we introduce the model equations and recall the main results
concerning the RNGH instability, in Section 3 we illustrate and comment the
numerical results and ﬁnally in Section 4 we draw our conclusions.

1 Model

Consider an incoherently pumped and homogeneously broadened two–level
active medium of length Lm, contained in a ring cavity of length Lc, interact-
ing with a unidirectional plane wave laser ﬁeld. We assume that the cavity

is resonant with the atomic transition frequency and that the cavity mir-
rors reﬂectivities are close to unity so that the uniform ﬁeld limit holds. The
Maxwell–Bloch equations describing such a laser can be written in the form
[6]

In these equations F (ζ, τ ) is the normalized slowly varying envelope of the
laser ﬁeld and P (ζ, τ ) and D(ζ, τ ) are the normalized slowly varying envelope
of the medium polarization and the population inversion, respectively (see
[6] for the normalizations). The parameters A, σ and γ have been already
deﬁned in the Introduction. We use the adimensional time τ and longitudinal
coordinate ζ, which are related with time t and space z through τ = √γ||γ⊥t
and ζ = 2πz/ (˜αLm), where

is the adimensional free spectral range of the cavity, being c the light velocity
in the host medium. The actual free spectral range of the cavity, FSR, is
related to ˜α by

hence γ ˜α represents the FSR measured in units of the homogeneous linewidth.
The boundary condition for the electric ﬁeld

means that F can be expressed as a superposition of plane waves with a spatial
wave–number α equal to an integer multiple of ˜α (with our scaling of space and
time α denotes both the spatial wave–number and the temporal frequency).

Eqs. (1-3) have two stationary solutions, the laser–oﬀ solution ¯F = ¯P = 0
and ¯D = 1, and the resonant single–mode lasing solution ¯F = √A
1 eiφ,
¯P = ¯F /A and ¯D = 1/A, where φ is an arbitrary phase. This solution appears
at the lasing threshold A = 1.

2 Numerical results

We have numerically integrated Eqs. (1-3) for ﬁxed relaxation rates γ = 1 and
σ = 0.05, letting the frequency α and the pump A as variable parameters.
Notice that, although σ
γ, this choice of the parameters does not mean
that we are considering a class–A laser, i.e. a laser where the time evolution
of electric ﬁeld is much slower than those of the material variables. This would
be true in the single–mode limit, but here we are studying a multi–mode laser,
where the n–th side–mode oscillates at an angular frequency αn = n ˜α of order
1 or larger, therefore the time scale of the electric ﬁeld is comparable to those
of the material variables, as in class–C lasers.

≪

Our choice of σ corresponds to a mirror transmissivity T close to 0.1. In fact,
if distributed losses are negligible, the cavity linewidth σ and the free spectral
range ˜α are related by σ = ˜α T /(2π), and we will consider values of ˜α around
4.

The integration method is based on a modal expansion of the electric ﬁeld [14]

F (ζ, τ ) =

ei n ˜αζfn(τ ) ,

(10)

which allows to convert Eqs. (1-3) into a set of ordinary integro–diﬀerential
equations for the 2N + 1 complex mode amplitudes fn and for the variables
Pm(τ ) = P (ζm, τ ) and Dm(τ ) = D(ζm, τ ), with m = 1 . . . M. For the present
analysis we veriﬁed that 11 modes (N = 5) and a spatial grid of M = 21
points are enough to reproduce accurately the total electric ﬁeld.

Fig. 2. The instability domain of Fig. 1 is represented together with the existence
domain of the multi–mode solution, delimited by the dashed–dotted line. In the
shaded area there is bistability between the single– and the multi–mode solution.
The dashed line indicates the threshold for the Hopf bifurcation of the multi–mode
solution.

We proceeded as follows: First we ﬁxed α between α− and α+ and took a pump
value for which the single–mode solution is unstable. Then we varied the pump
A in both directions to determine the boundaries of the multi–mode solution.
We repeated the operation for several values of α even moving below α−. In
Fig. 2 the boundary of multi–mode emission found in this way is represented
with a dashed–dotted line together with the boundary of the single–mode
solution instability domain, indicated by the solid line. The shadowed area
marks the domain where both the single–mode and the multi–mode solutions
are stable.

Two features of the bistability domain are of particular interest:
(i) The domain extends to the left up to A
≃
(ii) The domain extends up to a frequency ¯α
4.56 larger than αc = 4.47.
Hence, considering A as the bifurcation parameter, the bifurcation is subcrit-
ical not only for αmin < α < αc, as shown by Fu in the class–B limit, but also
for αc < α < ¯α.
(iii) The domain extends up to a minimum frequency αmin

13, well below Ac = 14.93.

modal intensities are constant and phases are locked. The dashed line marks
a Hopf bifurcation. At the right of this line the dynamics of the total intensity
is quasi–periodic and the modal intensities and the relative phases oscillate
periodically in time.

In order to analyze this in more detail, we describe now the dynamics of the
system for the particular value α = 4.2 as a function of the pump parameter
A. In Fig. 3 the modal intensities corresponding to the central mode, I0, and
the two ﬁrst sidebands (modes I±1 and I±2) are represented as a function of
A (the intensities of higher order modes are, at least, one order of magnitude
smaller than I±2).

There are three clearly distinguishable zones in Fig. 3:
(i) For A < AP B = 14.49, the modal intensities are constant and single–valued,
and symmetric modes have the same intensity (I+n = I−n, n = 1 . . . 5).
(ii) for AP B < A < AHB = 15.33, the modal intensities are constant but there
are two possible solutions, denoted as Ina and Inb in the ﬁgure, and symmetric
= I−n). Precisely, when I+n = Ina, then
modes have diﬀerent intensities (I+n
I−n = Inb, and viceversa.
(iii) For A > AHB the modal intensities are no more constant (for this domain,
in the ﬁgure we have represented the extrema of the modal intensities).

Fig. 4. Modal frequencies (a) and relative phase (b) as a function of the pump A in
the region around the pitchfork bifurcation. The relative phase Ψ1 is measured in
radians.

Hence, looking at the modal intensities, we can conclude that they are subject
to a pitchfork, symmetry breaking, bifurcation at A = AP B and to a Hopf
bifurcation at A = AHB.

We studied more in detail the two multi–mode self–pulsing solutions that co-
exist in the interval AP B < A < AHB. One could imagine that these solutions
diﬀer in the total intensity, because all the modes placed on one side of the
spectrum have intensities larger than the corresponding modes on the other
side. But this is not the case: the shape of the pulses emitted by the laser
is exactly the same for the two solutions. How this can be possible can be
understood looking at the behavior of modal frequencies and phases.

In the upper panel of Fig. 4 we show the calculated frequencies of the central
mode (ω0) and of the ﬁrst side–modes (ω±1), to which we have subtracted
α. In the lower panel of the same ﬁgure we
the empty cavity frequencies
represent in radians the relative phase Ψ1 = φ+1 + φ−1
2φ0, where φi is
the phase of the i–th mode. If the solution is phase–locked Ψ1, as well as all
the other relative phases Ψi that can be deﬁned in the same way, must be
constant.

Fig. 5. Total intensity (a), intensities of the central mode and of the ﬁrst two
side–modes (b), and relative phase Ψ1 (c) after the Hopf bifurcation. A = 15.4

We see that at the pitchfork bifurcation the modal frequencies experience a
shift in the same direction, positive or negative for the two solutions. This
shift however preserves phase–locking, although Ψ1 is no longer equal to 0 as
for A < AP B, but it can take two opposite values, associated with the two
solutions. Notice that the maximum frequency separation between the two
phase–locked solution is about 0.02.

The combination of diﬀerent mode intensities, frequencies and relative phases
makes it possible that the total intensities for the two solutions are identical.

Let us now analyze the laser dynamics beyond the Hopf bifurcation A = AHB.
In Figs. 5, 6, and 7 we considered the three diﬀerent values for the pump
A = 15.4, A = 16 and A = 16.8. In each ﬁgure the upper panel shows the
total intensity, the middle panel the modal intensities of the central mode and
of the ﬁrst two side–modes, and the lower panel the relative phase Ψ1 deﬁned
above, measured in radians. The total intensity displays a slow modulation
with period of some hundreds time units, superimposed to the much faster
self–pulsing oscillations of period 2π/α
1.5. This slow modulation is clearly
related to the oscillations of the modal intensities and of the relative phase,
which have the same period. The period is almost the same in Figs. 5 and 6,
and it is almost twice larger in Fig. 7. The strength of the modulation increases

with A, and the relative phase Ψ1 passes from the almost regularly periodic
oscillations of Fig. 5(c) to the behavior shown in Fig. 7(c), where Ψ1 remains
most of the time close to 0.

We notice that the slow modulation frequency for the smaller values of A
is close to the maximum frequency separation between the two phase–locked
solutions that is achieved immediately before A = AHB. Hence, we may in-
terpret the dynamical state that arises from the Hopf bifurcation as a state
where the two phase–locked solutions are present simultaneously, and oscillate
at their beat note.

Let us ﬁnally comment that we have not found chaotic behavior. Certainly
the quasi–periodic dynamics of the total intensity is more involved as pump
increases, but multi–mode emission disappears before more complex dynamics
develops.

3 Conclusion

We have numerically and theoretically investigated bistability between single–
mode and multi–longitudinal mode solutions in the standard ring–cavity two–

level laser within the uniform ﬁeld limit. We have determined the domain of
coexistence between the single–mode and multi–longitudinal mode solutions
for a class–C laser (we have used γ = 1, and σ = 0.05) ﬁnding that this
domain is relatively wide. In particular we have found that the domain of co-
existence is diﬀerent from that corresponding to a class–B laser as it extends
for α slightly larger than αc and for A < Ac (for class–B lasers it exists for
Ac [22,23]). We have also found that the multimode solution
α
undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation (which is a symmetry breaking bifurcation)
and a subsequent Hopf bifurcation that destroys mode–locking. In the near
future we plan to extend this numerical study to a situation closer to that
of the experimental conditions in [18], in order to determine up to what ex-
tent the deviations from the theoretial predictions could be interpreted as a
manifestation of the coexistence between single–mode and multi–longitudinal
mode emission.

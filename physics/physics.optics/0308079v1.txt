The stability of two-dimensional bright vortex solitons in a media with focusing cubic and defo-
cusing quintic nonlinearities is investigated analytically and numerically. It is proved that above
some critical beam powers not only one- and two-charged but also multiple-charged stable vortex
solitons do exist. A vortex soliton occurs robust with respect to symmetry-breaking modulational
instability in the self-defocusing regime provided that its radial proﬁle becomes ﬂattened, so that
a self-trapped wave beam gets a pronounced surface. It is demonstrated that the dynamics of a
slightly perturbed stable vortex soliton resembles an oscillation of a liquid stream having a surface
tension. Using the idea of sustaining eﬀective surface tension for spatial vortex soliton in a media
with competing nonlinearities the explanation of a suppression of the modulational instability is
proposed.

INTRODUCTION

Spatial optical solitons and vortex solitons are self-
trapped light beams of ﬁnite cross section that are sup-
ported by a balance between linear diﬀraction (disper-
sion) and nonlinear self-focusing of the intense wave.
These structures have been predicted and experimentally
demonstrated in various nonlinear optical media (see [?
] and references therein). An optical vortex soliton has
embedded phase singularity and carries intrinsic angu-
lar momentum. The phase circulation around the axis
of propagation is equal to 2πm, where integer number
m is the topological charge of the vortex. We inves-
tigate the possibility of formation and stability of two-
dimensional multiple-charged (having topological charge
m to be equal up to ﬁve) localized envelope vortices on
the basis of the Nonlinear Schr¨odinger Equation (NSE)
with competing cubic-quintic (CQ) nonlinearities.

It is well known, that ordinary nonspining bright soli-
tons are stable in CQ nonlinear media. Though all lo-
calized optical vortex solitons (LOVS) were believed [? ]
to possess a strong azimuthal modulation instability. As
a result, an unstable vortex decays into several spatial
solitons with zero topological charges, which ﬂy oﬀ tan-
gentially to the initial vortex ring conserving the total
angular momentum. Recent investigations [? ? ? ? ]
have shown, however, that in CQ nonlinear media one-
and two-charged LOVS become stable if their numbers
of quanta (beam power) exceed the critical values Ncr.
Nevertheless, vortices with m > 2 were still regarded to
be unstable because of the modulation instability [? ].
We show here that, in contrast with what was previously
believed, even higher-order (with m > 2) vortices become
stable above certain threshold value Ncr, where Ncr in-
creases with topological charge.

The important, but still open question is: what is the

∗Electronic address: ayakim@kinr.kiev.ua

physical essence of a vortex (m 6= 0) symmetry-breaking
instability suppression? It is remarkable, that in self-
defocusing regime (when an increase of the input power
leads to broadening of the light beam) vortex as well
as soliton shape changes abruptly above certain critical
power: the radial intensity distributions becomes practi-
cally uniform with pronounced surface. As was demon-
strated previously [? ], this modiﬁcation of the soliton
proﬁle corresponds to some bifurcation.
It is interest-
ing that here the light beam gets some common features
with a liquid stream. Actually, the sharpness of the soli-
ton shape modiﬁcation corroborates the conception [? ]
of ”phase gas-liquid transition”. The authors of Ref. [? ]
demonstrated that a laser light gets some kind of surface
tension above certain threshold beam power (in a “liq-
uid” state). By numerical simulations of soliton collisions
against planar boundaries and localized inhomogeneities
they proved that two-dimensional “liquid solitons” be-
have like liquid streams having a surface tension.

It is reasonable to expect that such “gas-liquid transi-
tions” do happen with vortex solitons too. In this paper
we propose and validate the explanation of a vortex soli-
ton stabilization on the basis of the sustaining surface
tension conception. We show here that the dynamics of
slightly perturbed stable vortex resembles the oscillation
of a liquid stream having a surface tension. The remark-
able analogy of light “condensation” with an eﬀect of
condensate droplet formation [? ] in the N -particle bo-
son system at the large N limit is revealed.

II. VORTEX SOLITONS

We consider here the intense laser light beam propa-
gating in CQ media with focusing cubic and defocusing
quintic nonlinearities. Refractive index of CQ materials
can be approximated as follows: n = n0+n2I −n4I 2, here
I is the intensity of light beam, coeﬃcients n2, n4 > 0 de-
termine nonlinear response of the media. It is important
to note, that for some nonlinear materials [? ] this ﬁtting

formula works even in strongly nonlinear self-defocusing
regime, when I > n2/2n4, so that ∂n/∂I < 0.

The electromagnetic ﬁeld envelope Ψ(x, y, z) of linearly
polarized laser beam, which propagates along z through a
CQ nonlinear optical material, is described in the parax-
ial approximation by generalized NSE (GNSE):

i∂zΨ + D∆⊥Ψ + B |Ψ|2 Ψ − K |Ψ|4 Ψ = 0,

(1)

where ∆⊥ = ∂2/∂x2 + ∂2/∂y2 is the Laplacian operator,
D = 1/2κn0, B = κn2, K = κn4, κ is the wave number
of the light beam.

For localized solution of the GNSE (1) the following in-
tegrals of motion are assumed to be ﬁnite: (i) beam power
|Ψ|2 d2r, (ii) momentum:

where γ(z) is the phase curvature, parameters a(z) and

tively. The parameter A(z) can be expressed in terms
of N and a(z) using deﬁnition of the number of quanta
N . After the procedure of Ritz optimization one can ob-
tain for the variables a(z) and β(z) = γ(z)a(z) the set of

From Eq. (8) it follows that (i) m-charged vortex soliton
exists only above the threshold beam power: N > Nm,
(ii) if beam power exceeds the doubled threshold value:
N > 2Nm, the self-focusing regime turns into the self-
defocusing one, (iii) for N ≫ Nm the eﬀective radius
a0 of the two-dimensional structure has the asymptotic
behaviour of the form: a0 ∼ N 1/2. As was found in
[? ], the radial proﬁle of an ordinary soliton in
Ref.
self-defocusing regime changes abruptly, if beam power
exceeds quadruple threshold power for soliton existence:
N > 4N0. It is remarkable, that the point of “gas-liquid”
condensation of nonspining light beam, which has been
revealed in Ref. [? ], also corresponds to power N = 4N0:
laser light with N > 4N0 attains some kind of eﬀective
surface tension. Above certain value of the beam power
a vortex soliton gets a sharp boundary too [see Fig. 1
(b)], likewise the gas cloud, which condenses into the
liquid droplet. This state with nearly uniform density of
quanta ∼ |Ψ|2 can be considered as a condensate stream
ﬂowing along the axis z.

A deeper insight into physical essence of this phenom-
ena can be obtained using the analogy between the mod-
els, describing the photon gas (1) and bosons interacting
[? ] the one-dimensional
via δ-like potential. In Ref.
system of a ﬁnite number of bosons with the pairwise
attraction and three-body repulsion has been considered
in the self-consistent ﬁeld approximation on the basis of

the one-dimensional NSE with CQ nonlinearity. As was
[? ], an addition of particles to
demonstrated in Ref.
such boson system causes the increase of the density of
the particles until the three-body repulsion becomes sig-
niﬁcant. The further increase of N leads to appearance of
the state having nearly homogeneous distribution of the
particles and constant binding energy. This N -particle
bound state in the large N limit has been considered as
condensate droplet in the coordinate space [? ]. The
“trapping energy” per one particle (the Hamiltonian per
one quantum) tends to the ﬁnite negative value, for two-
dimensional LOVS under consideration, as it had been
found for self-trapped bosons [? ]:

ε = lim
N→∞

H/N = −

3b2

.

It is clear that binding energy per unit length along z (the
Hamiltonian H) for the ﬁnite size system is less than it
would be for the inﬁnite one, since not all “binding in-
terreactions” act on “surface particles”. This leads to
appearance of a surface tension and negative surface en-
ergy. As was shown in [? ], the value

Hs = lim
N→∞

(H − N ε) = −2Nmε,

can be treated as an analog of the surface power. In the
next section we investigate how the surface power, which
appears as an eﬀective surface tension, inﬂuences on the
vortex structure evolution in z-direction.

considered independently and treated as exponentially
growing: ε(~r, z) ∼ eΓLz. Therefore, the linear stability
analysis after the linearization is reduced to solving the
eigenvalue problem for growth rates ΓL. If ΓL > 0, the
perturbation grows up, so that LOVS would decay into
L ﬁlaments. We have solved this eigenvalue problem nu-
merically. The growth rates of the all unstable eigen-
modes for LOVS with m = 3 are presented in the Fig. 3.
It is seen that the widest instability region corresponds to
L = 2 and the higher-order perturbation are suppressed
even for small Λ in the vicinity of the threshold Nm. As
seen from Fig. 3, above some critical beam power Ncr the
modulation instability of LOVS with m = 3 is completely
suppressed – all growth rates are equal to zero. The same
analysis has been performed for higher-order LOVS (up
to m = 5), and it has been found that above some crit-
ical beam powers N > Ncr multiple-charged LOVS are
stable.

The LOVS stability has been conﬁrmed by means of
direct numerical simulation of the nonstationary GNSE
(1) with the perturbed LOVS as initial condition. The
dynamics of stable LOVS has been found to be quasiperi-
odical – eﬀective width and amplitude of perturbed vor-
tex oscillate with z.

Let us consider the dynamics of small oscillations of a
LOVS surface in more details. In the framework of varia-
tional analysis the parameters of the stationary LOVS are
determined by (8). Expanding the Hamiltonian around
the stationary point one straightforwardly obtains that
dynamics of eﬀective width a(z) of a vortex wave beam
is described by the Newton-like motion equation:

As known, in contrast to nonspining solitons, which
are stable with respect to rather large symmetric and
asymmetric perturbations, LOVS are stable for small
radially-symmetric perturbation, but unstable with re-
spect to asymmetric ones. A small azimuthal pertur-
bation may grow forming several ﬁlaments, and, as the
result, a LOVS decays into a few ordinary solitons, which
ﬂy oﬀ in such a way, that the total angular momentum of
the system conserves. A typical example of the dynamics
(in z-direction) of unstable vortex is drawn in Fig. 2.

To consider an initial stage of the instability, we have
performed the linear stability analysis of the LOVS with
respect to small perturbations:

Ψ(~r, z) = {ψ(r) + ε(~r, z)} exp {imϕ + iΛz}

with diﬀerent azimuthal periods:

ε(~r, z) = a+(r, z)eiLϕ + a−(r, z)e−iLϕ,

where |ε(~r, z)| ≪ |ψ(r)|. The azimuthal number of the
perturbation L = 0, 1, 2, ... determines the number of
humps on the envelope surface. Since we investigate
the linear stage of instability, all unstable modes may be

where ξ(z) = a(z) − a0, µ(N ) = N (m + 1)/8D. Thus,
the frequency of small oscillations of slightly perturbed
vortex soliton is:

In conclusion, we have found the conditions for the ex-
istence of stable multiple-charged localized optical vor-
tex solitons in a CQ nonlinear media. They occur sta-
ble above some critical beam powers Ncr, in the self-
defocusing regime provided that their proﬁles become
ﬂat-topped. The increase of LOVS beam power above
Ncr leads to formation of the vortex structure having the
pronounced plateau on the radial intensity distribution
and the sharp boundary. We have found out that the dy-
namics of the slightly perturbed stable vortex is similar
to oscillations of liquid stream having a surface tension.

We have drawn a parallel between the known phenomena
of condensation in the boson system and the laser light
beam “condensation”. We have estimated the surface
beam power and corroborated that LOVS has an eﬀec-
tive surface tension, which causes a vortex stabilization.
Actually, the sustaining surface tension suppresses small
modulations of the vortex surface. It impedes the forma-
tion of the ﬁlaments, therefore LOVS becomes stable in
a “liquid” state.

We believe that described mechanism can be used to
explain LOVS stabilization in other materials with com-
peting focusing-defocusing nonlinearities, e.g. in the me-
dia with defocusing cubic and focusing quadratic ones
[? ]. Moreover, the insight into the physical reasons
of LOVS stabilization would allow one to choose more
suitable nonlinear material for experimental realization
of the stable vortex solitons.

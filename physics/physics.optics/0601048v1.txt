We present a fully relativistic analysis of Bessel beams revealing some
noteworthy features that are not explicit in the standard description. It is
shown that there is a reference frame in which the ﬁeld takes a particu-
larly simple form, the wave appearing to rotate in circles. The concepts of
polarization and angular momentum for Bessel beams is also reanalyzed.

Bessel beams are solutions of Maxwell’s equations with important proper-
ties: they propagate with an intensity pattern that remains invariant along a
given axis [1], and carry an angular momentum that is not due to their polar-
ization state [2]. Their experimental realization in laboratories has attracted
much attention in recent years [3].

The aim of the present paper is to study the general properties of Bessel
beams within a fully relativistic framework. We show that, contrary to the
case of a plane wave, there is a privileged reference frame in which the linear
propagation is eliminated and the wave propagates circularly. This particular
frame corresponds, in a certain sense, to an antiparaxial limit. A general
implication is that Maxwell’s equations admit as solutions electromagnetic
waves that propagate in circles.

Our starting point is the deﬁnition of a Bessel electromagnetic wave in
terms of Hertz potentials Π1 and Π2 [4]. In cylindrical coordinates {ρ, φ, z},
the electromagnetic potentials are given by [5]

An electromagnetic mode is associated to each Hertz potential, giving rise
to transverse magnetic (TM) and electric (TE) modes respectively. Using a
Cartesian basis, it follows that the most general superposition of these waves
is given by [6]

Clearly the electric an magnetic ﬁelds are interchanged under a duality trans-
formation BK → EK and EK → −BK. A compact way to write the above
expressions is:

EK ± iBK = (EK ∓ iBK)e−iωt+ikzz

(here and in the following, the argument of all Bessel functions is k⊥ρ).

The complex Lorentz invariant of the electromagnetic ﬁeld follows from

the above expressions:

where ℜE and ℜB are the real parts of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, that
is, the physically measurable quantities. Notice that, unlike the case of a
plane wave, the Lorentz invariant ℜEK · ℜBK can be diﬀerent from zero.
From Maxwell equations, this implies that

ℜEK · ∇ × ℜEK 6= 0

(11)

for monochromatic waves. A similar expression follows for the magnetic
ﬁeld. Eq. (11) can be satisﬁed only if there is no scalar ﬁeld g(r) such that
∇ × (gℜEK) = 0. Thus the rotational behavior of the electric and magnetic
ﬁeld cannot be removed continuously: this is a manifestation of the fact that
Bessel beams have optical vortices.

There are two particularly important superpositions of Bessel modes: the

so-called right and left polarized states, given by the conditions

and the states for which

ωEK ± ikzBK = 0,

EK ± iBK = 0.

(12)

(13)

The ﬁrst condition corresponds to a wave whose electric ﬁeld has components
along either ˆex + iˆey or ˆex − iˆey, and its z component is negligible in the
paraxial approximation; however, the corresponding magnetic ﬁeld in this
case has a rather complicated structure. The second deﬁnition appears more
naturally within a quantum optical framework: it corresponds to a basis of
orthonormal modes in which the operators for the energy, the helicity, and
the z-components of linear and orbital angular momentum are all simulta-
neously diagonal [5]. Eqs. (12) or Eqs. (13) are equivalent in the paraxial
approximation.

For circularly polarized beams in the sense of Eq. (13), the complex
Lorentz invariant vanishes, in close analogy with a standard plane wave of
arbitrary polarization, while the Lorentz invariant given by Eq. (10) takes a
simple form but it is not strictly zero. This means that the temporal averages
of |ℜEK|2 − |ℜBK|2 and ℜEK · ℜBK are zero, although the corresponding
values at a given time do not vanish.

At this point, we notice that there is a particular reference frame in which
TE and TM Bessel modes take a simpler form. This is the frame moving

4

along the z axis with velocity v = kz/ω and Lorentz factor γ = ω/k⊥. The
standard Lorentz transformation to this new frame is

t′ =

(ωt − kzz)

1
k⊥

1
k⊥

z′ =

(ωz − kzt),

(14)

and the same transformation holds for the t and z components of the potential
Aµ. Thus the transformed electromagnetic ﬁeld does not depend on the
coordinate z′, since k′
z = 0. Changing to this frame is equivalent to taking
an antiparaxial limit. If the mode satisﬁes the paraxial approximation in
the laboratory frame, the above Lorentz transformation involves an ultra
relativistic velocity, v ∼ 1.

A direct calculation shows that the scalar potential Φ = 0 in the new
frame, and therefore the Coulomb gauge is satisﬁed directly. As for the
vector potential, it takes the form:

A′ = −

(16)

The electric and magnetic ﬁelds are

vK = Jm e−ik⊥t′+imφez.

E′ = EKuK + BKvK

B′ = −BKuK + EKvK.

In the antiparaxial reference frame, the magnetic (electric) ﬁeld of a trans-
verse electric (magnetic) mode is parallel to the z axis.

The standard deﬁnition, Eq. (12), of right and left polarization imple-
z = 0. That is, the “circularly

mented in this frame leads to EK = 0 because k′

polarized beam” becomes a TM mode whose electric ﬁeld points in the z di-
rection. On the other hand the deﬁnition Eq. (13) leads to an electric ﬁeld
with a projection in the XY plane that is a superposition of two opposite cir-
cular vectors with amplitudes proportional to Jm∓1, while the z component
of the ﬁeld is proportional to Jm and has a relative phase ±π/2.

In Fig. (1), we illustrate the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the plane
perpendicular to the z axis, as seen in the antiparaxial frame, for a circu-
larly polarized mode in the sense of Eq. (13). Notice that, as previously
mentioned, ℜE and ℜB are not perpendicular in general. Edge phase dislo-
cations, saddle points and vortices [7] are present. Some of these structures
are formed around the zeros of Jm and J ′
m. In Fig. (2), the intensity patterns
|ℜE|2, |ℜB|2 and their sum are illustrated. Notice the complementary space
distribution of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

As for the dynamical properties of the ﬁeld, a noteworthy feature in the

new frame is that the z component of the Poynting vector is

(20)

so that it vanishes for pure TE or TM modes, as expected from the fact that
k′
z = 0. On the other hand, the local ﬂux of energy for circularly polarized
modes in the sense of Eq. (13) is diﬀerent from zero even in this frame.
Nevertheless, the integral over whole space of (ℜE′
K)z is zero since

Let us now turn our attention to the angular momentum. Its total density

The above equations can be obtained in a relativistically covariant form.
Since the conservation of angular momentum is related to a rotational sym-
metry, it is natural to use the Killing vector kα associated to rotations around
the z axis. This vector is deﬁned as kα∂α = ∂/∂φ, and has the standard
property ∇αkβ = −∇βkα, where ∇α is the covariant derivative (see, e. g.,
Weinberg [9]). In cartesian coordinates (xµ, µ = 0 to 3):

kα = (0, −y, x, 0) ,

∇αkβ = ǫ0αβ3 .

Using the energy-momentum tensor for the electromagnetic ﬁeld Fµν:

T αβ =

F αµF β ·

µ −

gαβ(F λµFλµ)

4π h

it follows that the condition ∇βT αβ = 0 implies that the four-vector J α ≡
kβT αβ is conserved, that is: ∇αJ α = 0. Thus, using the fact that Fαβ =
∇αAβ − ∇βAα and ∇αF αβ = 0, it turns out that J α can be written as:

J α =

F αµkν∇νAµ + F αµAν∇µkν − ∇µ(F αµkνAν) −

kα(F λµFλµ)

4π h

Since J α has zero divergence, the integral over a three-dimensional hypersur-
face with normal unit four-vector nα and volume element dV ,

is independent of the particular choice of the hypersurface and thus is a con-
served quantity. In particular, choosing such hypersurface as t = constant,
which implies that nα = (1, 0), it follows that

nαJ α =

F 0mkν∇νAm + F 0µAν∇µkν − ∇m(F 0mkνAν)

We readily identify the ﬁrst term in this equation as the orbital angular
momentum density, given by Eq. (23) and the second term as the spin den-
sity, Eq. (24). As for the third term, its volume integral involves a three-
dimensional divergence and can be taken as zero if the ﬁeld vanishes at
inﬁnity. Thus, we have recovered the standard formulas (23) and (24) in a
covariant form. The dependence of the reference frame appears through the
choice of time-like unit vector nα.

Applying Eq. (23) and taking only the real parts of the complex ﬁelds, it

turns out that in the laboratory frame

which is non null for all kinds of polarization and is proportional to the az-

Thus, in the antiparaxial frame a purely transverse magnetic mode has null
SK
z , while any other cylindrical mode, such as a circularly polarized wave,
has a “spin” density in the z-direction. Notice, however, that the integral
of the z component of the Poynting vector, Eq. (20), and the integral of SK
z
over the whole space are zero in this frame. This result is consistent with the
interpretation of the integral of SK
z as a helicity operator. As for the sum of
the orbital and spin angular momentum densities averaged over a cycle, it
turns out to be

An alternative deﬁnition of the orbital and spin angular momentum den-
sities that has the advantage of being gauge independent has been proposed

by Barnett[10], who deﬁned the time-averaged z-component of the orbital
angular momentum ﬂux (for complex electric E and magnetic B) as

the beam.

In conclusion, a relativistic analysis reveals the existence of a particu-
lar moving frame in which Bessel beams have a simpler form. In practice,
this may be a frame moving at relativistic speed. However, since we are
dealing with exact solutions of Maxwell’s equations, some invariants can be
easily calculated and the covariance of variables such as the angular mo-
mentum densities can be studied. Although the deﬁnitions of the so called
orbital and angular momentum densities have some ambiguities, it must be
expected that these quantities do not change qualitatively, or even vanish, by
a Lorentz transformation. Actually, we have shown that there are important
cancellations in the antiparaxial limit. Thus it seems more appropriate to
interpret the standard angular momentum density SK
z as the helicity den-
sity, in accordance with our discussions in a previous paper[5]. Moreover,
the orbital angular momentum is expected to be ﬁnite in the antiparaxial
frame if it is diﬀerent to zero in any other frame, but that is not the case
when the expression of M ORB
It is also
clear from our analysis that the deﬁnition of polarization which is used for
plane waves cannot be applied unambiguously to a Bessel beam. One must
be careful in deﬁning what is meant by polarized states:
in fact, we have
shown two diﬀerent deﬁnitions leading to diﬀerent properties. As a further
application of the present relativistic analysis, we will study the motion of
charged particles in the ﬁeld of Bessel beams in a forthcoming paper.

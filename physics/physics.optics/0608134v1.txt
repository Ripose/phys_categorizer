Reconstructing the impulse response of a diﬀusive medium with the Kramers-Kronig
relations

The Kramers-Kronig (KK) algorithm, useful for retrieving the phase of a spectrum based on the known spectral
amplitude, is applied to reconstruct the impulse response of a diﬀusive medium. It is demonstrated by a simulation
of a 1D scattering medium with realistic parameters that its impulse response can be generated from the KK
method with high accuracy.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently there has been a growing interest in light
propagation in diﬀusive or turbid media [1]. This can
be attributed to several areas of application-driven re-
search. Diﬀusive media are ubiquitous in our environ-
ment, and imaging through them is always a challenge.
Clouds, mist, fog, dust and smoke decrease the visibility
on land while surface waves and turbid water reduce vis-
ibility at sea. In the medical ﬁeld, the main obstacle that
a physician encounters while trying to diagnose internal
organs is the diﬀusivity rather than the absorption of the
biological tissues. As a consequence, many methods were
developed to image through and to investigate diﬀusive
media [1].

One of the most intuitive methods to investigate a dif-
fusive medium is to measure its’ impulse response by a
fast detector [2–6], since, in principle, the impulse re-
sponse carries all the optical information of any linear
medium. In practice, fast detectors measure the inten-
sity of the impulse response. The ’ﬁrst-light’ component
of the impulse response carries the ballistic information of
the medium. This information can be used in the recon-
struction of the ballistic image of the diﬀusive medium.
Obviously, since the number of ballistic photons is ex-
tremely small, the image can be partially reconstructed
by the quasi-ballistic (or ”snake”) photons, which would
impair the spatial resolution of the image.

Assuming that the amount of detected quasi-ballistic
photons is suﬃcient for the image reconstruction, in order
to obtain high resolution images the detectors must be
very fast to distinguish between the (quasi) ballistic and
the diﬀusive photons. As a consequence such an imaging
technique requires complicated and expensive equipment.
This is one of the main motivations for developing
spectral techniques [7–10], i.e., techniques which work
in the spectral domain instead of the temporal one [4–6].
In one of these techniques the spectral response of the

erel@yosh.ac.il

medium H (ω) = A (ω) exp [iϕ (ω)] is measured for each
wavelength in a wide spectral range [11–13]. While an
amplitude A (ω) measurement is a relatively simple task
(and fast, since it does not require long averaging), a
phase ϕ (ω) measurement is more complicated since it
usually requires interferometric processes that are inher-
ently complicated and susceptible to ﬂuctuations. There-
fore, phase measurements are of limited value when the
medium varies in time. However, if the phase is recon-
structed from the amplitude measurement and the pro-
cess is suﬃciently fast, the temporal impulse response
can be easily generated even for a varying medium by a
simple inverse Fourier transform. Since in most cases the
diﬀusive medium can be regarded as linear (and hope-
fully time-invariant) system the Kramers-Kronig (KK)
method [14,15] can be used to derive the phase from the
amplitude measurement.

Nevertheless, the KK method has several drawbacks.
Firstly, in order to derive the phase one needs the am-
plitude over the entire spectrum (from zero to inﬁnity),
while experiments can produce amplitude measurements
for only a ﬁnite range of frequencies. As a consequence,
any evaluation of phases with the KK method is always
an approximation (see, for example, ref. [16]). Some
methods were developed to improve these approxima-
tions (by improving the convergence of the integrals) such
as the singly and multiply subtractive KK relations ( [17]
and [18] respectively).

A more complicated problem arises from the logarithm
function, which diverges whenever the spectral response
of the medium H (ω) vanishes. As a consequence the full
KK relation is [19]

where the P denotes Cauchy’s principal value. The ﬁrst
term on the right is the ordinary KK relation, while the
second one is the Blaschke term, which takes account all
of the zeros ωj of H (ω).

The problem with the zeros of H (ω) is more funda-
mental since while the ﬁrst mentioned problem can be

1

mitigated, at least in principle, by measuring the am-
plitude for a larger spectral range, the zeros of H (ω)
cannot in general be deduced from the amplitude mea-
surements alone. This problem is confronted mainly in
reﬂection measurements, where H (ω) may vanish at cer-
tain complex frequencies (for a discussion on this subject
see refs. [20] and [21]). However, a diﬀusive medium in
the transmission conﬁguration is a good candidate for the
implementation of the KK method in the following case.
In any diﬀusive medium the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the
medium D and its size L determines the smallest fre-
D/L2, which is related to its recip-
quency scale δω
∼
L2/D – the mean time a photon
rocal parameter tD
dwells in the diﬀusive medium . If the measured spec-
ωmin is considerably larger than
tral range ∆ω
δω then the main features of the impulse response can
be retrieved from the KK relations. Moreover, we will
demonstrate that in this regime it is possible to evaluate
beyond the spectral range (i.e.,
the amplitude
ω < ωmin and ω > ωmax) by a certain average over its
values inside ωmin < ω < ωmax. In what follows we will
revert to wavenumbers instead of frequencies, but the
transition between the two is trivial.

In most previous works the desired parameter was the
refractive index of a medium, so that the KK method
was mostly implemented for cases where the attenua-
tion was caused by absorption rather than by scatter-
ing. As a result, using the KK method as a tool to mea-
sure the impulse response of a diﬀusive medium was not
common. Recently, we demonstrated [12] that the KK
method, even in its simplest and most naive form can
be used to reconstruct the impulse response of a Fabry-
Perot interferometer, whose response is governed solely
by scattering. It was shown that with relatively simple
equipment its’ impulse response can be evaluated with
very high temporal resolution (less than 200fs).

In this paper we demonstrate by a numerical simula-
tion that the KK method can be useful in determining
the phases of the transfer function of a diﬀusive medium.
It is also shown that the calculated spectral response can
be used in reconstructing the medium’s impulse response
with high accuracy.

II. THE MODEL

We investigate a 1D homogenous medium with N small
scatterers, each having a diﬀerent refractive index and
width, randomly distributed in the medium. For sim-
plicity it is assumed that the width of each scatterer lj is
considerably smaller than the beam’s wavelength λ (i.e.,
lj << λ for every j), however, this is not a restrictive as-
sumption since a diﬀusive medium, whose dimensions are
considerably larger than the medium’s diﬀusion length
is characterized, almost by deﬁnition, only by a median
value for the scattering coeﬃcient (i.e., as long as the set

of scattering coeﬃcients are similar the ﬁne structure of
each scatterer is not important; similarly, the exact lo-
cations of the scatterers have a negligible eﬀect on the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient).

For simplicity we ignore polarization eﬀects, and thus

the 1D stationary-state wave equation has the form

∂2
∂x2 ψ2 +

2πn (x)
λ

(cid:18)

2

(cid:19)

ψ = 0

(2)

where ψ (x) is the electromagnetic ﬁeld and n (x) is the
refractive index.

In general, the refractive index of a diﬀusive medium,
modeled as a homogenous medium with multiple ran-
dom scatterers, has the general form presented in ﬁg.1.
For simplicity, however, we choose to simulate the vari-
ations in the refractive index of the medium by delta
functions, which corresponds to scatterers whose dimen-
sions lj are considerably smaller than the beam’s wave-
length lj << λ, consistent with our previous assumption.
It should be stressed, that any small 1D scatterer (with
respect to the wavelength) can be replaced for any prac-
tical reason with a delta function, the reason being that
neither its width lj nor its strength δnj (the diﬀerence be-
tween its refraction index and the surrounding) appears
separately in the scattering solutions, only their product
ljδnj does. Therefore, a small scatterer, whose width and
strength are lj and δnj respectively can be replaced by
a delta function whose prefactor is proportional to ljδnj
(see below for details).

regime, approximation (7) can be improved by noticing

III. SIMULATION

For simplicity we choose air as the homogenous
medium, i.e., n0 = 1 (however, the results can easily
be scaled to any dielectric medium with an arbitrary n0)
with 150 small scatterers, where the distance between
them is a random variable, distributed uniformly between
0 and 5µm (i.e., 0
5µm). Similarly, the strength
of each scatterer is also a uniform random number so
0.03µm (this corresponds to glass parti-
that 0
cles having widths on the order of tens of nanometers).

As can be seen, except for the delay between the two

nique, the two signals are very similar. Evidently, they
are not identical but the diﬀerences between them are
quite small. In Fig.4 we reveal details of the temporal
response and compare the two responses over a small
temporal window, showing that the two are alike even
on the microscopic level.

If the spectrum of the incoming pulse is narrower, i.e.,
the incoming pulse is temporally broader, the spikes in
the outgoing pulse are respectively wider.
In Fig. 5
and 6 the impulse response of the same system is pre-
sented when the spectral width of the incoming pulse
is ten times narrower (than in Figs. 3 and 4), that is,
∆ω = 2π
30THz. As can be seen from these plots,
the KK approximation is even better for the spectrally
narrow pulse. Therefore, although the integration in the
KK expressions covers a narrower region, and in principle
should yield inferior results, since the spikes are tempo-
rally wider and therefore are less susceptible to dispersion

IV. THE EFFECT OF THE CORRECTION TERM

The dispersion coeﬃcient is therefore proportional to

deformation, the reconstruction is improved. The prob-
lem is, however, that as ∆k decreases and gets closer
to δk there is insuﬃcient spectral information to recon-
struct the complete impulse response and the error in the
evaluation of macroscopic averages (such as the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient) increases.

V. SUMMARY

We have demonstrated through numerical simulations
that the KK method can be used to reconstruct the im-
pulse response of a scattering medium with realistic pa-
rameters. It was shown that when the measured spectral
width is considerably larger than the reciprocal of the

the KK method yields a satisfactory prediction of the im-

pulse response. Moreover, it was demonstrated that it is
possible to take advantage of the fact that in a diﬀusive
medium the spectral variations are very large but their

running average has relatively small variations. There-
fore, the integrand of the KK relations can be evaluated
even outside the measured spectral domain as the aver-
age value of the measurements. It was shown that this
evaluation improves the reconstruction of the impulse re-
sponse.

Although we focused in this work on the optical prop-
erties of a diﬀusive medium, this technique can be im-
plemented to any wave dynamics in diﬀusive media, e.g.,
acoustic scattering (photon scattering), x-ray scattering,
electron scattering etc.

Owing to the simplicity and speed of the KK method,
we believe that this technique is a promising tool for char-
acterizing and imaging through diﬀusive media.

With these two types of matrices, one can generate the
matrix of the medium that includes the ﬁrst j scatterers
Mj if the matrix of the j-1 scatterers Mj−1 is known

Mj = AjDjMj−1.

Therefore, with a simple recursion the matrix of a
medium MN with an arbitrary number of scatteres N
can easily be generated.

Finally, the transfer function H (k), which in our case
is the transmission coeﬃcient of the medium, can easily
be reconstructed from the matrix of the entire medium

FIG. 8. An illustration of the incoming and outgoing waves

at the vicinity of a single scatterer.

Since we are discussing a 1D medium, consisting of
the scatterers in an otherwise totally homogenous envi-
ronment, then in every point in space between two scat-
terers the ﬁeld of the incoming and outgoing waves (see
Fig.8) can be described by two coeﬃcients. Therefore,
for a given k the vector

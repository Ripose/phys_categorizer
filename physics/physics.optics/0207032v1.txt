Abstract

We propose a two-magnet design of a drift region
for a free-electron laser without inversion (FELWI).
By performing direct calculations of the phase shifts
for electrons passing the drift region, we prove that
the small-signal gain integrated over the detuning is
positive and is inversely proportional to the energy
spread of the “hot” electron beam. The dispersion
and the geometry of the drift region are speciﬁed,
and the requirements to the electron beam quality,
including the transverse size and the angular spread,
are found.

Introduction

Free electron lasers (FELs) are able to produce ra-
diation in diﬀerent domains, from microwaves [1] to
X-rays [2]. They have found many applications [3],
including nonlinear spectroscopic characterization of
quantum wells [4], solid surfaces [5], for near-ﬁeld sur-
face microscopy [6], infrared photodissociation spec-
troscopy of molecules [7], laser surgery [8], [9], mate-
rial research and processing [10], interaction of X-rays
with matter [11], etc. The FEL gain is attributed to
the interference of the ampliﬁed electromagnetic wave
E0 and the waves emitted by the electrons at the

wiggler magnets. The phases of the wiggler-induced
waves are sensitive to the electron velocity detuning
from the resonance. This leads to the odd gain proﬁle
shown in Fig. 1. The the constructive interference,
which is needed for the positive gain, requires match-
ing these phases and impose limitations on the elec-
tron beam energy spread, angular divergence, trans-
verse size, and, consequently on the maximum FEL
frequency and power [12].

Figure 1. Interference of waves emitted at wiggler mag-
nets and gain of an FEL.

A laser without inversion (LWI) [13] relies on the
phase control of the electron transition amplitudes,
interference suppression of the stimulated absorption
and keeping intact the stimulated emission. This
makes the gain possible even if there is no inversion,
i.e., if the majority of electrons are in the lower en-

1

ergy states. The LWI phase control is achieved by the
combined action of the external driving laser and the
spontaneous relaxation. A new kind of FEL was pro-
posed [14], which implements ideas of lasing without
inversion. In an free-electron laser without inversion
(FELWI) interfering free-free electron transition am-
plitudes are formed in wigglers, which are spatially
separated by the drift region. The drift region de-
lays diﬀerent electrons at diﬀerent phase shifts ∆ψD
relative to the ampliﬁed wave. For each electron a
proper phase delay can lead to a constructive inter-
ference of the ampliﬁed wave E0 and the radiation
emitted in the two wigglers. Thus the gain proﬁle of
an FELWI is positive for all energies, making lasing
possible even if there is no inversion, i.e., if there is
an equal amount of electrons above and below the
resonant energy. The positive small-signal gain pro-
ﬁle shown in Fig. 2 makes an FELWI advantageous
over an optical klystron or a one-wiggler FEL: for a
broad width ∆E of the electron energy distribution,
an FELWI gain scales as ∼ 1/∆E and exceeds the
gain of a one-wiggler FEL or an optical klystron gain,
which scale as ∼ 1/∆E 2. Thus an FELWI can be
considered as an optical klystron with an improved
phase control or a “phased” optical klystron.

namics in an FELWI drift region is the classical ana-
log of the spontaneous relaxation in a quantum LWI.
Diﬀerent kinds of drift region phase shifts were stud-
ied, including step-like phase shifts [15]–[18] and a
linear phase shift [19]. An electron optics design for
the linear phase shift was proposed [19].

In this paper, we suggest a two-magnet drift re-
gion for an FEL without inversion and prove by di-
rect calculation of electron motion in the drift region
that the suggested design indeed gives us FELWI
gain. Based on the suggested drift region, we are
able to address many important questions of FELWI
physics, which remained unsolved: how sensitive is
the FELWI phase control to the angular spread of
the electron beam, and how much the gain can be
enhanced with the phase shifts implemented with the
conventional electron optics elements.

The paper is outlined as follows. In Section 2 we
describe the electron and ﬁeld dynamics in the wig-
glers and ﬁnd correlations between the electron en-
ergy change in the wiggler and their ﬁeld-induced de-
ﬂection. In Section 3 we describe the suggested ge-
ometry of the drift region and by tracing electron
trajectories through the drift region we determine
requirements to the electron beam quality and esti-
mate the minimum wavelength of the FEL. In Section
4 we calculate the “hot”-beam gain of the FELWI
for an arbitrary linear phase delay in the drift re-
gion. We ﬁnd the acceptable range of the FELWI
drift region dispersion and demonstrate how the gain
changes with the increasing sensitivity of the drift
region phase shift to the ﬁeld-induced changes of the
electron trajectory. Finally, in Section 5 we summa-
rize our results.

The physics of an FELWI was studied in many im-
portant details [14]–[19]. It was shown that a FELWI
requires a correlation between the transverse electron
velocity and the electron energy change in the ﬁrst
wiggler [17]. A non-collinear FEL geometry provides
this correlation and allows for the essentially two-
dimensional electron dynamics in the drift region,
which is needed for the FELWI phase control [17],
[18]. It was shown that the FELWI is consistent with
the Liouville’s and the generalized Madey’s theorems
[18]. In this sense a multi-dimensional electron dy-

is the vector potential of the combined electromag-
netic ﬁeld of the laser (designated by a subscript L)
and the wiggler (designated by a subscript W ). The
electron and laser beams propagate at the small an-
gles α and θ to the axis of the wiggler, as in Fig. 3.
The z-axis is directed along the wiggler, so that
ψW = kW z, and the phase of the laser ﬁeld ψL equals
kL(z cos θ + x sin θ) − νLt + φ0.

Ω0 ≡ ˙ψI (0) = (~kL + ~kW ) · ~β0c − νL,

We assume in Eqs. (9), (10) that the role of the
drift region is to introduce the phase shift ∆ψD and
that the resonant detuning Ω is not changed in the
˙ψII (T ) = ˙ψI (T ). The change of the
drift region:
resonant detuning in the drift region can be neglected
if we assume that both the electron and laser beams
propagate in the second wiggler along its axis.
In
this case the angular spread ∆αD cause negligible,
second-order corrections to the initial conditions.

For a non-collinear FEL geometry, |α| + |θ| > 0,
the electron dynamics in the ﬁrst wiggler reveals im-
portant correlations. The changes of the resonant
detuning ∆Ω1 = ΩI (T ) − ΩI (0) ≡ Ω1 − Ω0 and the
slow phase ∆ψ1 = ψI (T ) − ψI (0) in the ﬁrst wig-
gler correlate with the wiggler-induced changes of the
electron energy ∆γ1, the transverse electron velocity
∆vx 1, the turn angle ∆α1 of the electron velocity in
the ﬁrst wiggler, and the transverse electron position

is the unit vector along the electron beam direc-
tion, ~β ≡ ~v/c = {βx, 0, βz} is the dimensionless elec-
tron velocity in the wiggler determined by Eqs. (42)-
(45). Initial conditions for Eqs. (4), (5) specify the
slow phase ψI (0) and ψII (T ) (for the ﬁrst and sec-
ond wigglers respectively) and the resonant detuning
˙ψI (0) ≡ Ω0 and ˙ψII (T ) ≡ Ω1:

We interpret these correlations in terms of the photon
emission and absorption: the electrons that absorb
energy from the ﬁeld get deﬂected in the direction of
the laser beam. Depending on their initial conditions,
the electrons can earn or loose energy. The angular
separation of the “radiating” and “absorbing” elec-
trons makes it possible to treat these electrons diﬀer-
ently in the drift region. This provide an additional
degree of freedom in the phase control and allows one
to arrange the FELWI phase shift.

The pendulum equation (4), (5) is solved by consid-
ering the electron-light interaction as a perturbation
and expanding the slow phase in the power series over

The phase evolution is coupled to the change of the
laser ﬁeld through the Maxwell’s equations. The cur-
rent density ~J = nee~v and the electron velocity ~v
are given by Eq. (41) of the Appendix. The wave
equation for the laser ﬁeld envelope AL is simpliﬁed
by the slow varying envelope approximation, which
allows to neglect second derivatives of the ﬁeld AL,
and the resonant approximation, which ignores the

For a two-wiggler FEL separated by a drift region,
the change of the vector potential ∆AL of Eq. (14)
depends on the initial phase φ0 and the phase shift
∆ψD introduced by drift region. A proper drift re-
gion phase shift ∆ψD, which can depend on the ini-
tial phase φ0, arranges the constructive interference
of the ampliﬁed radiation and the radiation emitted
in the two wigglers by most of electrons regardless of
their initial energy. In this papaer, we consider im-
plementation of an FELWI with a linear phase shift

∆ψD = ς + χ Ω1 T + ξ ∆Ω1 T + ϑ ∆ψ1,

(15)

where T = LW /c is the time it takes electrons to
pass the wiggler. The coeﬃcients ς, χ, ξ, and ϑ are
determined by the drift region geometry. They de-
scribe the constant part of the phase shift, the drift
region dispersion T −1∂∆ψD/∂Ω1, and the sensitivity
of the phase shift to the change of the resonant de-
tuning ∆Ω1 and to the phase change ∆ψ1 in the ﬁrst
wiggler.

(13)

magnets

The FELWI phase control can be achieved by making
the path length through the drift region sensitive to
the electron energy and the transverse electron mo-
tion in the wiggler. First, the electron path length
should increase at large γ1 providing the negative
dispersion of the drift region, ∂∆ψD/∂γ1 < 0. This
condition is necessary for any FELWI, and we specify
the acceptable range of the drift region dispersion be-
low. It was shown [17]–[19] that the this requirement
alone is not enough for an FELWI and that the sen-
sitivity of the drift region to the transverse electron
motion is essential for the free electron lasing with-
out inversion.
In this paper, we explore the phase
shift ∆ψD which depends linearly on the direction of
the electron velocity after the ﬁrst wiggler, which is
linear in ∆Ω1, and and on the wiggler-induced shift
of the electron transverse position x1, which is pro-
portional to the ﬁeld-induced change of the resonant
phase ∆ψ1 of Eq. (11).

The suggested drift region design shown in Fig. 5
consists of two magnets. These magnets are assumed
to be made of a couple of magnetic plates of diﬀer-
ent polarity, with the magnetic ﬁeld directed parallel
to the y-axis. The magnet TM1 serves as an elec-
tron angular and energy analyzer while the magnet
TM2 turns the electron beam further from the origi-
nal direction, collimates and directs it to the second
wiggler.

is to be matched to the linear phase shift of Eq. (15).
Note that the initial width ∆x0 and initial angular
spread ∆α0 can wash out the FELWI gain, as they
contribute to the “constant” part of the phase shift
ς. Thus the FELWI drift region can impose its own
limitations on the quality of the electron beam.

The suggested implementations of the FELWI
phase shift [17]–[20] assume manipulation of the elec-
tron beam with the magnetic optics elements or the
optical beam manipulation with the set of prisms or
a Bragg reﬂector. In this paper, for the ﬁrst time, we
suggest and analyze in detail the performance of a
magnetic optics set for the FELWI drift region. The
set consists of two magnetic lenses which turn the
electron beam in the same direction. The sensitiv-
ity of angular and coordinate control is achieved by
aligning the ﬁrst magnet almost parallel to the elec-
tron beam at the exit from the ﬁrst wiggler. Then the
electrons exiting the ﬁrst wiggler at slightly diﬀerent
angles meet the ﬁrst magnet at rather diﬀerent points
and pass the drift region along diﬀerent routs. The
negative dispersion is achieved by letting the high-
energy electron, which are less deﬂected by the ﬁrst
magnet, pass the drift region along a longer route,
while lower-energy electrons, which are deﬂected by
the ﬁrst magnet stronger, pass the drift region along
the shorter rout, as shown in Fig. 4.

Figure 5. Drift region geometry.

The drift region geometry is characterized by the
lengths B0B1 = L1, B1B2 = L2, B2B3 = L3 along
the reference trajectory, the angles δ1, δ2 between the
planes TM1, TM2 and the reference trajectory inter-
vals B0B1, B2B3 respectively. The magnets deﬂect
the electron at angles α1 and α2, which depend on
the electron energy and, for the second magnet TM2,
on the transverse position B2A2:

where b is the inhomogeneity length for the TM2
magnet. We assume that the deﬂection angles α10
and α20 are large as compared to the initial angular
spread of the electron beam ∆α0, its ﬁeld-induced
angular spread ∆α1, the angles θ and α between
the wiggler axis and the propagation directions of
the light and electron beams, the angles δ1 and δ2
between the TM1 and TM2 magnets and the cor-
responding intervals B0B1 and B2B3 of the elec-
tron trajectory, and the angular spread α1 − α10 and
α2 − α20 introduced by the magnets TM1 and TM2.

We compare diﬀerent electron trajectories in the
drift region with the trajectory of a resonant “ref-
erence” electron, which has passed the ﬁrst wiggler
along its axis with the unchanged velocity ~v0 = ~v1 =
~vres and energy γ0 = γ1 = γres. The trajectory
B0B1B2B3 is characterized by its transverse posi-
tions B0, B1, B2, B3 at the exit from the ﬁrst wiggler
W1, at the magnets TM1 and TM2, and at the en-
trance to the second wiggler W2 respectively.

For an arbitrary electron, which we call “probe”,
the drift region trajectory A0A1A2A3
is to be
found and its length is to be compared to that of
B0B1B2B3. In Fig. 5 the “probe” electron was cho-
sen, which increased its energy in the 1-st wiggler and
yet entered the drift region at below-resonant energy
γ0 < γ1 < γres.

The relative phase shift ∆ψD − ∆ψD ref between
the “probe” and the “reference” electrons is deter-
mined by the path diﬀerence sA − sB ≡ sA0A1A2A3 −
sB0B1B2B3:

which is found by adding the path diﬀerences at the
intervals where the “probe” and “reference” electrons
move at rather diﬀerent angles due to the relatively
strong deﬂection α10 and α20 at the magnets TM1
and TM2: sA−sB ≈ (A1D1−C1B1)+(D2A2−B2C2),
where A1C1 ⊥ B0B1, B1D1 ⊥ A1A2, B2D2 ⊥ A1A2,
and A2C2 ⊥ B2B3, as shown in Fig. 6.

It is now straightforward to determine the phase
shift ∆ψD of Eq. (19). It is related to that of Eq. (15)
by using Eqs. (11), (56), (57) to express the param-
eters A0B0 = ∆x0 + ∆x1, ∆α1, ∆α0, ∆γ1, and ∆γ0
through the parameters and variables of the pendu-
lum equation: Ω0, ∆ψ1, and ∆Ω1 = Ω1 − Ω0. The

where the coeﬃcients fΩ0 , f∆Ω1, f∆ψ1, f∆x0, and
f∆α0 describe the sensitivity of the phase shift to
the initial resonant detuning Ω0, its wiggler-induced
change ∆Ω1, the wiggler-induced change of the slow-
phase ∆ψ1, the electron beam width ∆x0 and angular
spread ∆α0. They are described in the Appendix.

The drift region dispersion χ and the sensitivity pa-

lar spread ∆α0 and the transverse beam width ∆x0
to the phase shift ∆ψD of Eq. (20) should less than
one. Thus we estimate the maximum ∆α0 and ∆x0:

We summarize the suggested FEL parameters:

Electron beam:

relativistic factor γ0 = 15;
velocity angle to the z-axis α = −0.133 rad;
energy spread ∆γ0 = 1;
emittance ε = 40π mm·mrad;
angular spread ∆α0 = 5 · 10−4 rad;
transverse size ∆x0 = 4 mm;

Light beam:

wavelength: λ = 359 µm;

First wiggler oriented at the angle to the electron and
light beams:

Second wiggler oriented along the electron and light
beams:

period λW 1 = 2.73 cm;
number of periods NW 1 = 36;
length LW 1 = 0.98 m;
parameter K = 1.27;

period λW 2 = 8.79 cm;
number of periods NW 2 = 36;
length LW 2 = 3.16 m;
parameter K = 1.27;

deﬂection angle at TM1 α10 = 0.45 rad;
orientation of magnets
δ1 = δ2 = 3α10∆γ0/γ0 = 0.09 rad;
deﬂection angle at TM2
α20 = 3δ1 = 3δ2 = 0.27 rad;
TM2 inhomogeneity length b = 12.7 cm;
distances between magnets: L1 = L2 = 0.1 m.
The suggested parameters provide the phase shift
∆ψD suitable for free-electron lasing without inver-
sion:

∆ψD = const − Ω1 T + 0.6∆Ω1 T − 0.07∆ψ1

− 2 · 103∆α0 + 250∆x0

For a negative drift region dispersion, e.g., χ = −1,
it is possible to achieve free-electron lasing without
inversion by changing the sensitivity parameters ξ or
ϑ, as it is shown in Fig. 7. The four curves shown cor-
respond a usual FEL gain proﬁle G(u) for ξ = 0 and

or ξ = 0, ϑ = 3. For other drift region dispersion
χ 6= −1 the sensitivities ξ and ϑ change the shape of
the gain proﬁle G(u) diﬀerently.

Once the drift region for the FELWI is described,
we proceed with the calculations of the gain for the
phase shift ∆ψD of Eq. (15). The change of the vector
potential of the ampliﬁed wave, Eq. (14), is sensitive
to the drift region phase shift ∆ψD. A particular
form of the phase shift

∆ψ(0)

D = ς + χ Ω0 T = ς + χ Ω1 T − χ ∆Ω1 T.

(33)

was analyzed [19] and it was shown that such a
phase shift indeed provides an FELWI. In this paper,
we extend the results of [19] and ﬁnd the gain for an
arbitrary linear phase shift ∆ψD of Eq. (15). The
gain is found by calculating the integrals of Eq. (14)
over the lengths of both wigglers. The contribution
of the ﬁrst wiggler is described by the ﬁrst integral
of Eq. (14), which leads to the usual expression for
the gain, G = ∆|AL|2/|AL|2, of a one-wiggler FEL
(see [22] and Appendix). The two-wiggler FELWI
gain is found by using the perturbation theory ap-
proach and considering the ∆ψ(0)
D part of the phase
shift of Eq. (33) as the zero-order approximation to
∆ψD of Eq. (15). The wiggler-induced correction
∆ψD − ∆ψ(0)
D = (ξ + χ) ∆Ω1 T + ϑ∆ψ1 is treated
as a perturbation. Expanding the right-hand side of
Eq. (14) over the ﬁrst-order terms in the electron-
light interaction, we ﬁnd the change of the laser vec-
tor potential AL and the FELWI gain:

phase shift ∆ψD introduced by the drift region rear-
ranges electrons in the phase space according to their
resonant detuning and its change in the ﬁrst wiggler,
Fig. 9b. Then in the second wiggler most electrons
loose their energy and contribute to the light ampliﬁ-
cation. The resulting gain is positive for any resonant
detuning, either positive or negative, as it is shown in
Fig. 9d. The unipolar gain proﬁle is a characteristic
features of a FELWI.

The hot-beam FELWI gain Ghot of Eq. (35) is pro-
portional to the sensitivity ξ and ϑ of the drift region
to the ﬁeld-induced change of the resonant detuning
and the slow phase in the ﬁrst wiggler. The gain is
non-zero only for the negative dispersion −2 < χ < 0
and achieves maximum at χ = −1, as shown in Fig. 8.
Thus the combination of the proper negative disper-
sion and the sensitivity of the phase shift ∆ψD to
∆Ω1 and ∆ψ1 provides lasing without inversion in
the two-wiggler system: the gain G(u) is enhanced
and its shape changes from an odd to a unipolar pro-
ﬁle. For a usual FEL or an optical klystron with pos-
itive dispersion, χ > 0, the hot-beam gain turns to
zero, because in this case the gain G(u) has positive
and negative peaks, which compensate each other.
Note that the dependence of the phase shift ∆ψD
on the ﬁeld-induced change of the resonant detuning
and phase change in the ﬁrst wiggler can not be ne-
glected, even though the contribution of these terms,
(Ω1 − Ω0)T and ψ1 − ϕ0, can be small as compared
to |Ω1|T : without these terms the hot-beam FELWI
gain turns to zero according to the Madey’s theorem
[18], [24].

4.1 Phase distribution in the FELWI

To illustrate the physics of the FELWI operation, we
present in Fig. 9 the phase space distribution of the
electron beam while it passes the FELWI. Depending
on the initial phase φ0, both the electron energy γ
and its dimensionless resonant detuning u = ΩT are
increased or decreased, as it is shown in Fig. 9b. The

5 Conclusions

A realistic design of the drift region, which imple-
ments the FELWI gain is suggested and analyzed
in detail for the ﬁrst time. The design simplicity
is achieved due to the overall turning of the elec-
tron beam in the drift region. The geometry of the
drift region is related to the parameters describing
the FELWI gain: the drift region dispersion and sen-
sitivity to the ﬁeld-induced changes of the resonant
detuning and phase. The gain proﬁle and the hot-
beam gain of an FELWI is found for a linear phase
shift of the drift region. It is shown that free-electron

9

lasing without inversion requires the negative drift
region dispersion, which should be limited in the cer-
tain range. Another requirement to the phase shift is
that the electron path length through the drift region
should be sensitive to the direction of the electron ve-
locity or the transverse electron position at the exit
from the ﬁrst wiggler. The minimum FELWI wave-
length is found and related to the drift region sensi-
tivity parameters, to the transverse size and angular
spread of the electron beam. For available electron
beams the suggested FELWI can operate in the sub-
millimeter domain.

The described method for the phase control, which
is applied here for an optical klystron, can be ad-
justed, in principle, for other applications.
It can
be used for phase corrections and gain enhancement
in storage ring FELs because storage rings achieve
isochronous motion of the electrons by insertion neg-
ative dispersion sections [25], which can serve as a key
elements of a drift region for a storage ring FELWI.

A.4 First-order electron dynamics

The ﬁrst-order corrections to the electron canonical
momentum ~p, energy mc2γ, and coordinates x, z are
found by the perturbation theory over the electron-
light interaction. Eqs. (42)-(45) provide the zero-
order approximation and account for the (AW eiψW +
C.C.)2 part of the squared vector potential Ay of
Eq. (39). The resonant approximation reduces the re-
y −A2
maining part of the squared vector potential A2
W
to the ponderomotive potential 2(ALAW eiψ + C.C.)
with the slow phase

ψ = ψL + ψW = (~kL + ~kW ) · ~r − νLt + φ0.

(47)

The condition ˙ψ = 0 determines the resonant fre-

quency νres of the FEL:

(53)

The electron dynamics is governed by the sin ψ fac-
tors in the right-hand sides of Eqs. (49)-(53). Thus it
is reduced to the evolution of the slow phase ψ, which
is determined by Eqs. (4)–(5) below. This reduction
leads to the correlation between the ﬁeld-induced de-
ﬂection angle ∆α1, the changes of the electron energy
∆γ1 and its velocity components ∆vx1, ∆vz1:

We interpret this correlation in terms of the photon
emission and absorption in the wiggler: the electrons

the light beam.

A.5 Pendulum equation

The evolution of the slow phase ψ of Eq. (47) is de-
termined by the pendulum equation (4), (5), which
follows from Eqs. (49)–(53).

0 < t < T , and ψII (t) = ψ(0)

II = φ0 + ∆ψD + Ω0t in the
ﬁrst and second wigglers respectively. The ﬁrst-order

To relate the pendulum equation in the wiggler
with the initial conditions for the electron beam and
with the electron dynamics in the drift region, we
need to express the initial resonant detuning Ω0 of
Eq. (8) and its change in the ﬁrst wiggler ∆Ω1 =
Ω1 − Ω0 through the electron beam parameters: the
initial angular deviation ∆α0 of the electron velocity
from the beam propagation direction α, the initial de-
viation of the electron relativistic factor γ from the
resonance, ∆γ0 = γ0 − γres, and the wiggler-induced
change of the relativistic factor ∆γ1 = γ1 − γ0:

A.7 Field evolution - 1

The ﬁeld evolution in the FELWI is described by
Eqs. (13)-(14).

A.8 One-wiggler gain

The contribution of the ﬁrst wiggler is described by
the ﬁrst integral of Eq. (14), which leads to the usual
expression [22] for the gain, G = ∆|AL|2/|AL|2, of a
one-wiggler FEL:

where ε0 = 8.85 · 10−12F/m is the permittivity of
vacuum (SI units), HW is the amplitude of the mag-
netic ﬁeld of the wiggler, LW is the wiggler length,
and ne is the concentration of electrons. This is
a well-known result for the odd gain proﬁle of an

FEL: for energies above the resonance most of elec-
trons contribute to the ampliﬁcation, while for below-
resonant energies, most of electrons contribute to the
absorption of radiation. For all energies, below or
above the resonance, there are electrons contribut-
ing to the ampliﬁcation or absorption of radiation,
depending on the phase of the laser ﬁeld at the mo-
ment of the electron entry to the wiggler.

B Drift region geometry

The path diﬀerences acquired at each magnet
are found from the geometry of the quadrangles
A1C1B1D1 and A2C2B2D2 of Fig. 6:

(56)

A1D1 − C1B1 = A1B1(cos(α10 + δ1) − cos δ1),
A2D2 − C2B2 = A2B2(cos(α20 + δ2) − cos δ2). (59)

The contributions of other trajectory intervals to the
path diﬀerence is of the second order of the small
angles ∆α0, ∆α1, α, θ, δ1, δ2, α1 −α10, and , α2 −α20
and thus can be neglected. The intervals A1B1 and
A2B2 follow:

A1B1 = (A0B0 + B0B1(∆α0 + ∆α1) sin δ1,

The drift region geometry can be chosen so that the
linearized phase shift of Eq. (61) coincides with that
of Eq. (15). To ﬁnd the corresponding requirements,
the electron position A0B0 = ∆x0 + ∆x1 at the exit
from the ﬁrst wiggler, the angular and energy de-
viations ∆α1, ∆α0, ∆γ1, and ∆γ0 are related to
the ﬁeld-induced phase change ∆ψ1, the initial reso-
nant detuning Ω0 and its change in the ﬁrst wiggler
∆Ω1 = Ω1 − Ω0 given by Eqs. (11), (56), (57). The
linearized drift region phase shift ∆ψD follows:

∆ψD = ∆ψD ref +

+ ∆x0 · f∆x0 + ∆α0 · f∆α0,

where the coeﬃcients fΩ0, f∆Ω1 , f∆ψ1, f∆x0, and
f∆α0 describe the sensitivity of the phase shift to
the initial resonant detuning Ω0, its wiggler-induced
change ∆Ω1, the wiggler-induced change of the slow-
phase ∆ψ1, the electron beam width ∆x0 and angular
spread ∆α0:

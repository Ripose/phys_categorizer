The tunnel eﬀect in electromagnetic
propagation

Abstract

The tunnel eﬀect is considered here within the framework of elec-
tromagnetic propagation. The classical problem of a plane gap of
dielectric, surrounded on both sides by a medium with larger refrac-
tion index, is studied in the case in which an electromagnetic plane
wave impinges into the gap with an incidence angle larger than the
critical angle. In this condition (total reﬂection), the gap acts as a
classically forbidden region and behaves like a tunnel. The ﬁeld inside
the forbidden gap consists of two evanescent waves, each one having
its wavefronts normal to the interface. In the present paper we study
the total ﬁeld derived as a superposition of two such evanescent waves,
its wavefronts, and the directions of propagation of both phase and
energy.

In electromagnetism, an eﬀect analogous to the tunnel eﬀect of quan-
tum mechanics occurs when a plane wave, propagating in a medium with
refractive index n, impinges into a plane-parallel dielectric gap with refrac-
tive index n′ smaller than n, at an incidence angle larger than the critical
angle i0 deﬁned as sin i0 = n/n′.
If the thickness d of the gap is inﬁnite,
the ﬁeld within the gap consists of a plane evanescent wave – attenuating in
the direction normal to the interface – whose phase propagates in direction
parallel to the interface (see Fig. 1a). If d is ﬁnite, the boundary conditions
on both interfaces cannot be satisﬁed by a single evanescent wave and two
evanescent waves, with the same direction of propagation of the phase, but
attenuating into opposite directions, are required (see Fig. 1b) [1].

critical angle i0 = arcsin(n/n′), a single evanescent wave originates in medium

In this case, two evanescent waves,
1, surrounded on both sides by medium 2.
with the same direction of propagation but attenuating into opposite directions,
originate inside the gap. The width of the gap d is shown, together with the
coordinate system adopted in the theoretical analysis.

The properties of the total ﬁeld inside the forbidden region are due to
the fact that the two evanescent waves to be added have real amplitudes
with opposite trends of variation in addition to the fact that the wavefronts,
parallel to one another and normal to the interface, are not coinciding (on
one wavefront the phase of a wave is diﬀerent from the phase of the other
wave, see Eqs.(5)). Accordingly, the phase of the total ﬁeld varies along the
wavefronts of the single waves to be added, and the wavefronts of the total
ﬁeld are not parallel to those of the component waves.

Let us consider a system of Cartesian coordinates x, y, z (unit vectors of
the axes i, j, k) with origin at O (Fig. 1b), and an impinging TE wave with
the electric ﬁeld parallel to j, with direction of propagation si = (αi +γk) in
the plane xz. The y-component of the incident electric ﬁeld can be written
as

Ei = E0 exp[ik0n(αx + γz)] ,

(1)

where k0 = ω/c is the free-space wavenumber, E0 (which we assume to be
real) denotes the amplitude of the incident ﬁeld at the origin O and

γ = √1

α2 .

Inside the gap the total ﬁeld is the superposition of two TE evanescent waves,
whose electric ﬁeld (still parallel to j) can be written as

E+ = pE0 exp[k0(inαx

From Eq.
quantities are independent of the coordinates, and τ represents the amplitude
transmission coeﬃcient of the gap[2]. The total electric ﬁeld inside the gap

From Eq.(7) it turns out that the amplitude of Eg depends only on z (the
equi-amplitude surfaces are the planes z = constant), and decreases from the

inadequate for describing electromagnetic propagation within a tunneling
region[3].

As to the phase, from Eq. (7) it follows that the equation of wavefronts

(equi-phase surfaces) is given by

ϕ(x, z) = k0nαx + Ψ(z) + ϕτ = ϕ0 ,

(8)

Looking at Eq. (8), we can see that diﬀerent wavefronts, corresponding to
diﬀerent values of the phase, are simply shifted in the x-direction with respect
to one another. Figure 2 shows the wavefronts ϕ0 = 0, π, 2π for parameter
values referring to an experiment dealing with frustrated total reﬂection in
the range of microwaves[4].

We can now derive both the wavelength and the equation of the rays. To

this end, we have to evaluate grad[ϕ(x, z)] and we have

and, for the ray equation x = X(z) deﬁned as the lines of ﬂux of gradϕ,

where λ0 = 2π/k0 is the free-space wavelength (medium 2 in Fig. 1). We can
conclude, therefore, that the total ﬁeld inside the tunneling region is slow,
that is the phase velocity along the rays is slower than the light velocity c.

where X0 is a constant. From Eq.
(17), we can see that (as was to be
expected due to the symmetries of the problem) the rays are shifted in the
x-direction, and that, since the amplitude of the total ﬁeld is not constant
with respect to z, they are not straight lines (see Fig. 2).

By denoting the angle between a ray and the z-axis with χ (tan χ =

dX/dz (see Eq. (15)), we have, at z = 0,

while, at z = d,

Since χ is the refraction angle at z = 0 and the incidence angle into the second
interface at z = d, the unexpected conclusion is thus that the refraction low
seems not to be valid for the rays inside the gap.

The Poynting vector inside the gap has a component normal to the in-
terfaces, contrarily to what happens for the ﬁeld on the right of the single
interface of Fig. 1. In order to evaluate the ﬂux lines of the Poynting vector
and their relationship with the ﬂux lines of the phase, let us consider the
vector S describing the energy propogation[5]

and, by comparing this with Eq. (15), we see that the ﬂux lines of the energy
coincide with the ﬂux lines of the phase.

By means of Eq. (8), we are able to evaluate the phase diﬀerence ∆ϕ
between two opposite points, O and O′, along the z-direction inside the gap
(see Fig. 1b): we have

∆ϕ = ϕ(0, d)

By including in the total phase also the temporal factor exp(
garded until now, the phase delay in going from O (at t = 0) to O′ is

−

iωt) disre-

tϕ = ∆ϕ/ω.

(21)

In Fig. 3, we show tϕ as a function of the gap width, together with the time
tl = d/c. If we suppose to perform an experiment (like the one reported in
Ref. [4]) with a monocromatic wave and we put two probes at O and O′, we
would actually measure a phase delay as given by Eq. (21) which is, without
doubt, an observable[6]. To clarify the physical meaning of this delay we
have to complete the analysis by considering not a plane wave impinging the
gap, but a narrow beam or a wave packet[7, 8]. However, this improvement
exceeds the purpose of the present work and will be presented elsewhere.

Finally, we wish to note that tϕ becomes independent on d, for large
d (see Eq.
(21)). A behaviour of this kind was also obtained within the
framework of a quantum-mechanical theoretical model, due to Hartman[9],

for a particle tunneling through a rectangular potential barrier. Also in that
case, the “traversal time” under barrier tends to be constant for large barriers,
and the superluminal eﬀect so obtained is known as ”Hartman eﬀect”. It is
not easy to understand the nature of that time but its behaviour, for large
barrier, very similar to the one as derived here (Eq. (21)), could characterised
it as a phase-delay[4, 10].

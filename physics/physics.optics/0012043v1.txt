I present a theoretical treatment of parametric scattering
in strong coupling semiconductor microcavities to model ex-
periments in which parametric oscillator behaviour has been
observed. The model consists of a non-linear excitonic os-
cillator coupled to a cavity mode which is driven by the ex-
ternal ﬁelds, and predicts the output power, below threshold
gain and spectral blue shifts of the parametric oscillator. The
predictions are found to be in excellent agreement with the
experimental data

Recent experimental studies have demonstrated that
very large optical non-linearities can be obtained in res-
onantly pumped strong-coupling microcavities. The ex-
citations of these structures are polaritons, mixed modes
which are part exciton, part cavity photon, and the non-
linearity is due to interactions between the exciton com-
ponents, which cause the polaritons to scatter oﬀ each
other. This leads to a parametric process where a pair of
pump polaritons scatter into non-degenerate signal and
idler modes, while conserving energy and momentum.
The scattering is particularly strong in microcavities be-
cause the unusual shape of the dispersion, shown in the
inset to Fig.1, makes it possible for pump, signal and
idler all to be on resonance at the same time.

A further important property of planar microcavities
is the correspondence between the in-plane momentum
of each polariton mode and the direction of the external
photon to which it couples. This makes it quite straight
forward to investigate parametric scattering using mea-
surements at diﬀerent angles to access the various modes.
Two types of process have been studied in this way: para-
metric ampliﬁcation, where the scattering is stimulated
by excitation of the signal mode with a weak probe ﬁeld,
and parametric oscillation, where there is no probe and
a coherent population in the signal mode appears spon-
taneously.

Parametric ampliﬁcation in microcavities was ﬁrst ob-
served by Savvidis et al 1, using ultrafast pump-probe
measurements. The structure was pumped on the lower
polariton branch at an incident angle of 16.5◦. Narrow
band gains of up to 70 were observed in the region of
the polariton feature for a probe at 0◦, along with idler
emission at 35◦. These are a set of angles for which the
pair scattering resonance condition is satisﬁed. A related
scattering process has been studied by Huang et al 3 us-
45◦ and a probe at normal
ing two pump beams at
±
incidence. The experimental results of Ref. 1 have been
modelled by Ciuti et al 2 using a microscopic quantum
treatment of polariton-polariton interactions.

Parametric oscillator behaviour has been observed
Stevenson et al 4 and Baumberg et al 5, in CW exper-

iments with the pump incident on the lower polariton
branch at the ‘magic’ angle of about 16◦. Above a thresh-
old pump intensity, strong signal and idler beams were
observed at about 0◦ and 35◦, without any probe stimu-
lation. The coherence of these beams was demonstrated
by signiﬁcant spectral narrowing, proving that they are
due to a parametric process rather than resonantly en-
hanced incoherent photoluminescence. Houdr´e et al 6,
have also observed a nonlinear emission at 0◦ for a struc-
ture pumped at 10◦. However, in this experiment the pair
scattering resonance condition is not satisﬁed, suggesting
that diﬀerent physics may be involved.

7.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a simple clas-
sical model which provides a uniﬁed treatment of both
ampliﬁer and oscillator in the CW regime. This model
is based on the textbook treatment of parametric phe-
nomena in systems such as LiNbO3
Indeed, the mi-
crocavity behaviour has similar characteristics to a typi-
cal doubly-resonant parametric oscillator, where just the
signal and idler modes are cavity resonances – the pump
resonance is mainly important in enhancing the strength
of the nonlinear eﬀects. However, there are also signif-
icant novel aspects to the model: the microcavity op-
erates in the strong coupling regime, where the modes
are cavity polaritons not simple photons, and instead of
a non-resonant χ(2) nonlinearity, the exciton provides a
highly resonant χ(3) eﬀect.

I. MODEL

The theoretical model is a classical treatment of a non-
dispersive exciton mode, ψ(r), with energy ωx, coupled
to a cavity mode, φ(r), with dispersion ωc(k), which is
driven by the external ﬁelds. To account for broaden-
ing processes, ωx and ωc(k) are taken to be complex
energies, with imaginary parts γx and γc respectively.
The exciton mode is non-linear, with potential energy
V (ψ) = 1

2ψ2 + 1

12 κψ4.

To model the parametric processes, the cavity is driven
by harmonic plane waves, consisting of a pump with am-
plitude Fp at (ωp, kp) and a probe with amplitude Fs at
(ωs,ks). The cavity and exciton modes are also expressed
as a sum of plane waves at (ωp, kp) and (ωs,ks), plus an
ks). The cavity mode
ωs, ki = 2kp −
idler at (ωi = 2ωp −
is linear, so the equations of motion for the pump, signal
and idler mode separate out, giving

more complicated because the non-linearity generates
many terms at diﬀerent frequencies and wave-vectors.
Only the terms at frequencies ωp, ωs, ωi are retained
here: the others are at very diﬀerent frequencies, such as

It is interesting to compare the present classical model
with the treatment in Ref. 2, which gives a good ﬁt to
the pump-probe parametric ampliﬁer experiments of Ref.
1. This treatment was based on a quantum mechanical
picture of the exciton-exciton scattering process. How-
ever, with the approximations that were made, Eqs(1-3)
of Ref. 2, contain essentially the same physics as Eqs.(4)
here. Of course, using a microscopic model gives a value
for the non-linearity κ. However, κ only imposes a scale

on the problem: rescaling all the ﬁelds so ψ

It is often useful to make the simpliﬁcation of consider-
ing a situation where the pump, signal and idler energies
are all close to the corresponding polariton resonance val-
ues, and the broadenings are small compared to the Rabi
splitting Ω. Then it is a good approximation to replace
the polariton response by a single Lorentzian function at
2, where X is the exciton am-
each k, with strength

plitude (Hopﬁeld coeﬃcient) for the mode. The driving
terms on the right hand side of Eqs.(3) can similarly be
approximated by (C/X)f , where C is the photon ampli-
tude. Then, Eqs.(3) reduce to

In the parametric ampliﬁer, both fp and fs are non-
fp, so that
zero. It is also helpful to assume that fs ≪
ψs and ψi are small, and the pump depletion term in
Eqs.(3a,4a) can be neglected. Consider ﬁrst the situation
when the probe, idler and pump satisfy the triple reso-
nance condition, so Eqs.(4) can be used with ωp = ω0
p,
ωs = ω0
i . Without the pump depletion term,
these equations are solved by eliminating ψp and ψi using
(4a) and then (4c), to get

Fig.1 shows the signal response at normal incidence,
calculated using Eq.(9), for diﬀerent pump angles. The
pump energy is varied to be on the polariton resonance
for each angle. The spectra show the two polariton fea-
tures at normal incidence, with clear gain on the lower
branch for pump angles in the region of 16◦:
for this
pump angle, the pair scattering resonance condition is
satisﬁed when the probe angle is 0◦.

In Fig.2, the signal response is mapped out as a func-
tion of energy and angle with the pump kept on reso-
nance at 16◦. There is an enhanced probe response when
either the signal or the idler is on resonance – these sin-
gle resonance energies are indicated by the dashed lines
on the ﬁgure. The response is much stronger for the sig-
nal resonance, because the probe couples to the signal
directly, but to the idler only via parametric scattering.
The strongest response occurs at the double resonances,
where the dashed lines intersect (at 0◦, 16◦ and 33.5◦),
but there is a long segment of the dispersion very close
to double resonance, where the gain remains high.

signal and idler ﬁelds. Again, it is simplest to start with
the triply resonant case. Focusing on Eqs.(4b,4c), taking
the complex conjugate of one of them, and treating ψp as
a parameter, there are non-zero solutions for ψs, ψi only
if the determinant of the coeﬃcients is zero, that is:

The physical interpretation of this condition is obvious –
for a steady state solution, the generation rate of polari-
tons in the signal and idler directions, on the left hand
side, must equal the (geometric) mean of the loss rates,
√γsγi. This is only possible with the value of ψp in
Eq.(10). For a given external driving ﬁeld fp, the re-
quired value of ψp is attained by the depletion of the
pump polariton ﬁeld due to the stimulated scattering
term.

The resulting signal intensity is calculated by using
Eq.(4b) to write ψi in terms of ψs, then substituting in

2 required by Eqs.(10,13). For Ip > I0,

These results show that the signal intensity is deter-
mined by the pump depletion, which produces the value
2 re-
of
mains unchanged, just as the population inversion in a
conventional laser is clamped at its threshold level. Since
2 is unique to a particular pair of
the actual value of
signal and idler directions, in equilibrium there can only
be one ﬁnite signal amplitude. It is easy to see what will
happen in an out of equilibrium situation when there is
more than one signal. A signal whose loss rate exceeds
its generation rate will decay, while one for which the
generation rate exceeds the loss will grow. So, in a pro-
cess akin to mode selection in a laser, the signal with the
lowest loss rate will dominate, depleting the pump until
only it survives.

IV. DISCUSSION

p

This model of the parametric oscillator makes two sim-
ple predictions which can be checked against experiment:
the
Ip power dependence in Eq.(12), and the clamp-
ing of the pump polariton amplitude, ψp, to the value
given in Eq.(10). The latter eﬀect should be observable
as a saturation, above threshold, of the blue shift of the
polariton dispersion. Below the threshold the shift is
roughly linear with pump power, and it saturates at the
value given in Eq.(5) with Ip = I0. For the signal mode
the saturated shift is thus δω0
. Of
course, there are other eﬀects, not included in the model,
which can cause energy shifts. These include the exci-
ton renormalisation due to the signal ﬁeld, and at higher
powers the break down of the strong coupling regime.
The former eﬀect can be estimated and is small: the sig-
2, which is
nal ﬁeld will give an energy shift of κ

about 10% of the saturated δω0
s when Ip = 2I0, using the
same structural parameters as in Fig.1.

Fig.3 shows how these predictions compare with the
experimental results in Ref. 5. The signal power is ﬁt-
√I0 of Eq.(12). Although a
Ip −
ted to the form Is ∝
good ﬁt is obtained, it is diﬃcult to distinguish the
Ip
behaviour from a simple linear increase with the limited
range of data above threshold. The support for the model
provided by the blue shift data is rather better: the ex-
periments show a clear saturation of the blue shift, and
the saturation shift of just under 1 meV agrees very well
with the prediction of δω0
0.97meV obtained using the
s ≈
experimental widths γs = 0.57meV and γi = 0.80meV.

p

The predicted form of the gain in Eq.(7) is not found
in the pump-probe experiments of Ref. 1, where the gain
increases exponentially with Ip. However, the gain mech-
anism in the ultrafast measurements diﬀers from the
CW parametric ampliﬁcation discussed here. The peak
pump powers in the experiments are orders of magnitude
greater than the threshold I0, but oscillator behaviour is
not seen because there is insuﬃcient time for the signal
to build up just from the incoherent photoluminescence.
However, the probe pulse seeds the signal, starting an
an exponential growth which lasts as long as the pump.
This gives the observed exponential dependence on Ip.
Although the CW gain below threshold predicted here
has not been seen experimentally, it should be observable
in structures which show parametric oscillator behaviour.
To conclude, it has been shown that the parametric
oscillator behaviour recently observed in microcavities
can be well explained by a simple classical treatment of
a non-linear exciton strongly coupled to a cavity mode.
The main non-classical eﬀects that are missing from this
model are the incoherent photoluminescence, discussed
theoretically in a recent paper by Ciuti et al.,8 and quan-
tum statistical eﬀects in the oscillator behaviour around
the threshold. It is also possible that at higher excitation
powers the signal intensity will become large enough for
the appearance of new physics due to polariton-polariton
interactions in the coherent state.

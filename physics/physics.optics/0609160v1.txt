Abstract

We investigated the inﬂuence of the photonic mode density (PMD) on the triplet dynamics

of individual chromophores on a dielectric interface by comparing their response in the presence

and absence of a nearby gold ﬁlm. Lifetimes of the excited singlet state were evaluated in ordet

to measure directly the PMD at the molecules position. Triplet state lifetimes were simultane-

ously determined by statistical analysis of the detection time of the ﬂuorescence photons. The

observed singlet decay rates are in agreement with the predicted PMD for molecules with diﬀerent

orientations. The triplet decay rate is modiﬁed in a fashion correlated to the singlet decay rate.

These results show that PMD engineering can lead to an important suppression of the ﬂuores-

cence, introducing a novel aspect of the physical mechanism to enhance ﬂuorescence intensity in

PMD-enhancing systems such as plasmonic devices.

next to the experimental distribution of photons per bin (grey) and a double-Poisson distribution

(black) with averages equal to the on- and oﬀ-intensities.

The rate of spontaneous photon emission by an excited molecule can be modiﬁed by

changing the density of possible electromagnetic decay channels, i.e. the photonic mode

density (PMD) [1, 2, 3] at the emitter position.

In particular, a nearby metallic object

supporting plasmonic excitations can produce noticeable changes in the PMD. Together

with the increased optical excitation in a locally enhanced electric ﬁeld, modiﬁcations of the

PMD leading to a faster de-excitation have been identiﬁed as responsible for the enhanced

ﬂuorescence signal close to metal structures. This approach to obtain stronger ﬂuorescence

signals promises signiﬁcant progress for experimental schemes whrere weak ﬂuorescence sig-

nals need to be retrieved with high signal-to-noise ratios such as single molecule methods,

ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy and biosensors [15, 16]. Following ﬁrst experiments

in front of a metallic mirror [4, 5, 6], recent progress in nanofabrication technologies al-

lowed to investigate more sophisticated geometries showing more drastic modiﬁcations of

the PMD [7, 8, 9].Recently, a number of investigations addressed the quantitative analysis

of ﬂuorescence in PMD modifying environments [12, 13, 14]. In all these investigations, the

PMD eﬀects were analyzed in the framework of an enhanced singlet decay. In this paper,

we show that the PMD can also inﬂuence the triplet state dynamics (ﬂuorescence blinking)

of chromophores, leading to a signiﬁcant additional ﬂuorescence enhancement mechanism.

FIG. 1 depicts a simpliﬁed picture of the molecular ﬂuorescence process in terms of a three-

state model [23]. A molecule initially in the ground singlet state S0 is excited upon photon

absorption to the singlet excited state S1 with a rate k12. From S1, the molecule returns to S0

with a total rate k21 composed of a radiative decay k21,r and an intramolecular non-radiative

relaxation k21,nr; based on previous studies [24, 25], we will consider k21,nr as negligible.

A nearby metallic object can modify k21,r and introduces additional electromagnetic non-
radiative channels kem

21,nr. Eﬃcient ﬂuorophores perform many cycles like this in the singlet

subspace while ﬂuorescence photons are emitted. Although suppressed by spin selection
rules, singlet→triplet and triplet→singlet transitions (inter-system crossing ISC) still occur.

An excited molecule has a ﬁnite probability (k23) of undergoing ISC to a lower energy, long-

lived triplet state (T1) from which the molecule decays back to S0 with a rate k31; this latter

step may involve photon emission (phosphorescence). As a result, the ﬂuorescence emission

of single molecules is intermittent [26]. If the triplet lifetime is long enough (small k31) this

triplet blinking can be clearly observed in the ﬂuorescence emission of single molecules as

successive bright (on) and dark (oﬀ) periods (FIG. 1b), each characterized by its ﬂuorescence

and background intensity, respectively. Although ISC does not usually aﬀect the overall
ﬂuorescence quantum yield due to the low absorption of T1 at the frequency of the S0 → S1

excitation, it limits the maximum achievable ﬂuorescence intensity [26]. A reduction of the

triplet lifetime of organic ﬂuorophores, with a corresponding increase in brightness, was

demonstrated by the presence of molecular oxygen which quenches T1 and returns the

molecules to S0 up to 100 times faster[27, 28]. However, oxygen is undesired as it is also

responsible for most photodegradation processes.

Although most pronounced PMD enhancements are observed on irregular metal struc-

tures such as silver island ﬁlms or sharp metallic tips or junctions, we used planar systems

which are better suited for a quantitative study of the underlying physical eﬀects because

they can be prepared with high accuracy and can be fully modeled.

Two sample architectures were employed. Firstly, chromophores were placed on top of

a dielectric layer (Samples I). Secondly, the same dielectric layer was used as a spacer to

place the chromophores at a controlled distance from a thin gold ﬁlm (Samples II). FIG. 2a

shows a schematic of the two sample architectures and corresponding single molecule ﬂuo-

rescence confocal micrographs (epi-illumination through the glass slides) [24]; the ﬂuores-

cence blinking can be directly observed. The thicknesses of the gold ﬁlm and the dielec-

tric spacer layer were 44 nm and 30 nm, respectively in order to achieve optimum single

molecule detection [24, 25]. The dielectric spacer was composed of alternating layers of

poly(allylamine) (PAH) and poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS). On the samples with the gold

ﬁlm, the polyelectrolyte layers were prepared following a published method [24]. The

samples without the gold ﬁlm were prepared using the same procedure to deposit 2.5

PSS/PAH bilayers on optically transparent glass substrates, which were previously func-

tionalized with 3-aminopropyltriethoxy-silane (3-APTES) [29]. On both types of samples,

ﬂuorescent 1,1′,3,3,3′,3′-hexamethylindicarbocyanine iodide (DiIC1(5), Molecular Probes)

molecules were deposited electrostatically on the negatively charged surface of the multilayer
terminated with PSS by immersing the samples in a 10−10 M, Milli-Q water solution. The im-
mersion time (≈10-30 seconds) was adjusted such as to obtain well separated chromophores.

The polyelectrolytes were chosen as dielectric spacer because they can be prepared with

controlled thickness and allow for the chromophores at their interface to adopt all possible

orientations [24]. Chromophores of the DiI family are a well investigated model system for

ISC eﬀects [27, 28] mainly due to their relatively long triplet lifetime of 10-50 ms (in the

dry state and absence of O2). All measurements were conducted under continuous ﬂow of

4

dry nitrogen in order to exclude triplet quenching by oxygen.

A region of the samples was imaged on a home-built confocal microscope, in an epi-

illumination scheme from the glass side, a single molecule moved into the focus, and its

ﬂuorescence emission recorded as a function of time. Light from a laser-diode (Hamamatsu

PLP10-063/C ) was used for pulsed excitation (100 ps FWHM, 100 MHz repetition rate) at

λ = 633 nm through a 1.4 NA oil-immersion objective. In order to optimize the signal to

background ratio, annular illumination was used for samples II [24]. Fluorescence photons

were collected by the same objective, separated from the excitation light by suitable dichroic

and notch ﬁlters and their arrival times were recorded by means of an avalanche photo-

diode (Perkin-Elmer SPCM-AQR-13 ) and a time correlated single photon counting module

(Becker & Hickl SPC-630 ). For each detected photon two times were recorded independently:

the time elapsed since the last excitation pulse (micro-time) and the time elapsed since the

beginning of the measurement (macro-time), with a resolution of 7 ps and 50 ns, respectively.

The excited singlet state decay k21 was obtained by a single-exponential ﬁt to a histogram

of the micro-times [29]. The system response was limited to approx. 0.6 ns by the response

of the photodetectors [29]. Information about the ﬂuorescence blinking is provided by the

macro-times, which permit to obtain the ﬂuorescence intensity vs.time trace as shown in

FIG. 1 and in turn the length of the on- and oﬀ-times. The probabilities of a certain on-

or oﬀ-time length are exponentially distributed [26, 27, 29] and therefore, average times τon

and τof f can be extracted which are connected to the transition rates in the 3-level system

(FIG. 1) by τon = (k21 + k23)/(k12k23) and τof f = 1/k31. Alternatively, τon and τof f can

also be obtained from an exponential ﬁt to the ﬂuorescence intensity autocorrelation [30].

The latter method turns out to be more reliable, especially at low signal to background

conditions [29].

Changes in the PMD aﬀect all transitions coupled to the electromagnetic ﬁeld. This

eﬀect is well understood for k21 and can be fully modeled by considering point oscillating

electric dipoles interacting classically with the electromagnetic ﬁeld [2, 12, 13].

In the

following, an analysis of the variations of k21 is presented which gives direct access to the

PMD experienced by the individual molecules. This information is a prerequisite for the

analysis of the PMD-induced variations of the triplet dynamics that is shown later.

For chromophores near a plane interface, k21 depends on the polar angle φ between the

dipole moment of the molecule and the surface normal and can be calculated from the

5

limiting cases of molecules parallel (φ = π/2) and perpendicular (φ = 0) to the interfaces:

k21(φ) = sin2(φ) kk

21 + cos2(φ) k⊥
21

kk
21 and k⊥

21 are determined by the dielectric properties of the layered system [25].

Due to the very short immersion times used in the sample preparation, the chromophores

cannot diﬀuse inside the polymer [31] and are placed at the interface. In point-dipole theory,
kk
21 varies continuously across the interface whereas k⊥

21 takes two diﬀerent values at each

side of the interface according to the dielectric contrast:

(2)

with the subscripts N2 and pol referring to an inﬁnitely small displacement to the nitrogen

and polymer side, respectively. On a molecular level, the chromophores have a ﬁnite size

and the polymer surface has a certain structure leading to diﬀerent radiative decay rates for

molecules that probe more one or the other side of the interface. Thus, a distribution of k21

due to molecular orientation and local environment may be anticipated.

In FIG.2b, the experimental distributions of k21 obtained from approximately 100

molecules in each type of samples are displayed, together with calculated distributions.

Arrows indicate the theoretical decay rates for parallel and perpendicular dipoles at each

side of the interface [25]. These calculated rates need to be adjusted to the experimental

ones by one commom scaling factor for all calculated rates [24]; i.e. a reference is needed.

We assign the most frequent value of k21 in samples I to parallel molecules because those are

the statistically most probable and most eﬀectively detected molecules. The adequacy of

this choice is supported by the very good agreement between the calculated and experimen-

tally detected extreme values of k21 for molecules in samples I and the maximum detected

k21 for molecules in samples II. We know from previous studies that in samples II, parallel

molecules and molecules probing more the polymer side of the interface are not detectable

in this scheme [24]. Then, the minimum observed k21 is expected to be larger than the
minimum calculated k21 (kparallel

). The calculated distributions of k21 shown in FIG. 2b cor-

21

respond to randomly oriented molecules, half of them placed in N2 and half in the polymer.

Comparing the calculated and experimental distributions of k21, it is possible to conclude

that the sample preparation yields a smaller fraction of molecules with extreme lifetimes

than expected from random orientations and location; i.e. more molecules lie parallel to

6

the surface and/or probe the polymer side of the interface. In summary, the variations of

the PMD has been quantiﬁed by means of k21 for both samples and its distribution can be

fully explained by the diﬀerent location and orientation of the molecules with respect to the

interface and, in samples II, to the nearby gold ﬁlm.

With this information in hand, we proceed to investigate the eﬀect of the PMD on k31.

In FIG. 3, the distributions of k21 and k31 obtained from molecules in samples I and II are

shown together with a scatter plot of k31 vs k21. The distributions of k31 in samples I and

II diﬀer signiﬁcantly (Student-t test: t=3.25, P=0.14%): Molecules in samples II have both
an increased average k31 and large k31 values exceeding 200 s−1 that are not observed in the

absence of the gold ﬁlm. In spite of some statistical scatter, a positive correlation between

k31 and k21 can be observed in both data sets. Pearson linear correlation coeﬃcients of

R = 0.46 and R = 0.35 are obtained for the molecules in samples I and II, respectively.

The signiﬁcance of these correlations was tested by computing the probability of obtaining

by chance such R values or higher from non-correlated k31 and k21 data. Probabilities of

0.006% and 0.035% for samples I and II, respectively were obtained [29]. The correlation

between k21 and k31 can be explained by PMD variations for the individual molecules due

to their local environment and orientation if k31 depends in a similar fashion on the PMD

as does k21. While some interaction with the surroundings on a molecular scale aﬀecting

both transitions could also produce such a positive correlation, this can be excluded as the

reason for any diﬀerence between the molecules in samples I and II because they experi-

ence the same chemical environment in both samples. Therefore, the signiﬁcant diﬀerence

between the distributions of k31 in samples I and II must be assigned to a PMD-mediated

enhancement due to the nearby gold ﬁlm. This in turn supports the interpretation of the

positive correlation between k21 and k31 in terms of similar PMD eﬀects on the singlet and

triplet de-excitations.

The noticeable eﬀect of the PMD on k31 indicates that the transition T1→S0 occurs
mainly radiatively and that the transition dipoles associated with the T1→S0 and S1→S0

transitions have similar orientations. The latter is reasonable because for ISC to occur S1

and T1 should share the same molecular geometry. It is important to note that the PMD

enhancements achieved in this planar geometry are quite modest in comparison to what can

be achieved in more complex structures. The enhanced k31 can lead to noticeable stronger

ﬂuorescence signals, due to the faster return to the singlet manifold which allows to obtain

and 108 molecules in samples II. Below, 1-s ﬂuorescence emission traces of an average molecule in

more ﬂuorescence photons per time unit. As illustrative examples, two 1-second traces of an

average (A) and a strongly enhanced (B) molecule are shown also in FIG. 3 (An intermediate

case is shown in FIG. 1). Clearly, molecule B is a much brighter emitter than A because it

spends much more time in the singlet subspace emitting ﬂuorescence photons.

In conclusion, the inﬂuence of the PMD on the electronic transition rates involved in

molecular ﬂuorescence was investigated by studying the emission blinking and excited state

lifetime of individual molecules. The singlet de-excitation rate is aﬀected in good agreement

with theory. It was demonstrated that the triplet de-excitation is aﬀected in a similar way
by the PMD indicating that for the investigated system the T1→S0 transition has a strong
radiative component with a transition dipole moment of similar orientation to the S1→S0.

These ﬁndings complete the picture of the PMD-mediated ﬂuorescence enhancement which

was so far only discussed for the singlet manifold. Firstly, an enhanced excitation (k12) and

singlet decay (k21) at constant branching rate to the triplet (k23) allows the dye to emit more

photons before entering the triplet and secondly, the residence time in the triplet is reduced

8

due to its enhanced decay (k31). This new ﬁnding on the improvement of chromophore

performance should encourage further the investigation of PMD enhancing structures such

as plasmonic nano-objects to obtain single super emitters.

Depolarization regions of nonzero volume in
bianisotropic homogenized composites

Abstract

In conventional approaches to the homogenization of random particulate composites, the component
phase particles are often treated mathematically as vanishingly small, point–like entities. The elec-
tromagnetic responses of these component phase particles are provided by depolarization dyadics
which derive from the singularity of the corresponding dyadic Green functions. Through neglecting
the spatial extent of the depolarization region, important information may be lost, particularly
relating to coherent scattering losses. We present an extension to the strong–property–ﬂuctuation
theory in which depolarization regions of nonzero volume and ellipsoidal geometry are accommo-
dated. Therein, both the size and spatial distribution of the component phase particles are taken
into account. The analysis is developed within the most general linear setting of bianisotropic
homogenized composite mediums (HCMs). Numerical studies of the constitutive parameters are
presented for representative examples of HCM; both Lorentz–reciprocal and Lorentz–nonreciprocal
HCMs are considered. These studies reveal that estimates of the HCM constitutive parameters in
relation to volume fraction, particle eccentricity, particle orientation and correlation length are all
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the size of the component phase particles.

Introduction

The homogenization of a composite medium comprising two (or more) component phases provides
the backdrop for this study. The composite may be regarded as an eﬀectively homogenous medium
as long as wavelengths are suﬃciently long compared with the dimensions of the component phase
particles. In electromagnetics, the estimation of the constitutive parameters of homogenized com-
posite mediums (HCMs) is a matter of long–standing, and ongoing, scientiﬁc and technological

Indeed, recent developments pertaining to HCM–based metamaterials serve to
importance [1].
highlight the need for accurate formalisms in order to estimate the constitutive parameters of
complex HCMs [2, 3].

In conventional approaches to homogenization the microstructural details of the component phases
are often inadequately incorporated [4]. For example, the standard versions of the widely–applied
Maxwell Garnett [5] and Bruggeman [6] formalisms utilize simplistic descriptions of the spatial dis-
tributions and sizes of the component phase particles. An alternative approach to homogenization is
provided by the strong–property–ﬂuctuation theory (SPFT), in which a comprehensive description
of the distributional statistics of the component phases can be accommodated. While the origins
of the SPFT lie in wave propagation studies for continuous random mediums [7, 8], the SPFT has
lately gained prominence in the homogenization of particulate composites [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. By
means of the SPFT, the HCM constitutive parameters are estimated as successive reﬁnements to
the constitutive parameters of a homogenous comparison medium. Iterates are expressed in terms
of correlation functions describing the spatial distributions of the component phases. In principle,
correlation functions of arbitrarily high order may be incorporated; in practice, the SPFT is usually
implemented at the second order level of approximation. In fact, convergence of the SPFT scheme
at the second order level of approximation has been established for a wide range of linear HCMs
[14]. Within the second order SPFT, a two–point correlation function and its associated correla-
tion length characterize the component phase distributions. At lowest order (i.e., zeroth and ﬁrst
order), the SPFT estimate of HCM constitutive parameters is the same as that of the Bruggeman
homogenization formalism [9, 13].

The size of the component phase particles may be explicitly incorporated within homogenization
formalisms via depolarization dyadics [4]. These dyadics are central to homogenization analyses
as they characterize the electromagnetic ﬁeld inside component phase particles embedded within
a homogenous background. Often the component phase particles are treated as vanishingly small,
point–like entities. Thereby, the corresponding depolarization dyadic is represented by the singular-
ity of the associated dyadic Green function [15, 16]. However, potentially important information is
lost through neglecting the spatial extent of the component phase particles — especially if coherent
scattering losses are under consideration [17, 18]. To address this issue, extended versions of both
the Maxwell Garnett formalism [19, 20, 21] and the Bruggeman formalism [21, 22] have been de-
veloped in which a nonzero volume is attributed to the component phase particles. However, these
analyses apply only to isotropic HCMs and adopt a simplistic description of the distributional
statistics of the component phases. Recently, an extended version of the SPFT was established
for anisotropic dielectric HCMs, in which the sizes of the component particles and their spatial
distributions were taken into account [23].

In the following sections, the second order SPFT for the most general class of linear HCMs, namely
bianistropic HCMs [24], is extended to accommodate component phase particles of nonzero size.
The depolarization dyadic appropriate to an ellipsoidal particle of nonzero size, embedded in a

For certain Lorentz–reciprocal comparison mediums, the volume integral (12) which yields D>0(η)
may be reduced to a surface integral, but for a general bianisotropic comparison medium no such
simpliﬁcations are available. The integrals (12) and (19) may be evaluated using standard numerical
techniques [26].

studies of isotropic [17, 18, 19, 21, 22] and anisotropic [23] HCMs have emphasized the importance
of the nonzero spatial extent of depolarization regions.

3 Homogenization

The SPFT may be implemented to estimate the constitutive parameters of HCMs [9]. Let us
consider the homogenization of a two–phase composite wherein the two component phases, labelled
as a and b, comprise ellipsoidal particles of shape speciﬁed by U and linear dimensions speciﬁed
by η > 0. A random distribution of identically oriented particles is envisaged, such that all space
V is partitioned into parts Va and Vb containing the phases labelled a and b, respectively. We
consider the most general linear scenario wherein the component phases a and b are taken to be
bianisotropic mediums with 6

, is based upon the
HCM
iterative reﬁnement of the comparison medium constitutive dyadic, namely K
. To zeroth order
and ﬁrst order, the SPFT permittivity estimate is identical to the comparison medium permittivity

The HCM which results is a Faraday chiral medium [29, 30, 32]. A HCM of the same form also
arises from the homogenization of a magnetically–biased plasma and an isotropic chiral medium
[33].

We begin by considering the eﬀect of particle size η in relation to volume fraction fa. Accordingly,
the eccentricity is ﬁxed at ρ = 0, the orientation angle at ϕ = 0 and the correlation length at L = 0.

Now we turn to eﬀect of particle size η in relation to particle orientation. Let us ﬁx the following
parameters: volume fraction fa = 0.5, particle eccentricity ρ = 1 and the correlation length L = 0.

4.2.4 Particle size and correlation length

Finally, to focus upon the eﬀect of particle size η in relation to correlation length L, the volume
fraction is ﬁxed at fa = 0.5, the orientation angle at ϕ = 0 and the eccentricity parameter at ρ = 0.
The corresponding HCM constitutive dyadic has the form (36).

5 Concluding remarks

Homogenization formalisms, such as the widely-used Maxwell Garnett and Bruggeman formalisms,
often inadequately take into account the distributional statistics and sizes of the component phase
particles. The SPFT — through describing the distributional statistics of the component phases
in terms of a hierarchy of spatial correlation functions — provides a conspicuous exception.
In
the preceding sections, an extension to the SPFT for the most general linear class of HCM is
developed, in which a nonzero volume is attributed to the component phase particles. By means of

11

extensive numerical calculations, based on Lorentz–reciprocal and Lorentz–nonreciprocal HCMs, it
is demonstrated that estimates of the HCM constitutive parameters in relation to volume fraction,
particle eccentricity, particle orientation and correlation length are all signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by
the size of the component phase particles.

It is particularly noteworthy that the inﬂuence of the particle size is generally stronger on the
imaginary parts of the HCM constitutive parameters than it is on the corresponding real parts. In
this respect, the eﬀect of η is reminiscent of the eﬀect of the correlation length in the second order
SPFT [34]. Increasing the correlation length for the second order SPFT generally results in an
increase in the degree of dissipation associated with the HCM. This dissipative loss is attributed
to radiative scattering losses from the macroscopic coherent ﬁeld [13, 35]. It may be observed in
Figures 4 and 8 (and in numerical results for other HCM constitutive parameters not presented
here) that the eﬀects of particle size and correlation length on the estimates of the imaginary
parts of the HCM constitutive parameters are generally cumulative. This suggests that coherent
scattering losses associated with the HCM become greater as the particle size increases. A similar
ﬁnding was reported for anisotropic dielectric HCMs [23].

In conclusion, the importance of incorporating microstructural details, such component particle size
and spatial distribution, within homogenization formalisms is further emphasized by this study.

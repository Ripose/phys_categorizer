We demonstrate ultrafast all-optical deﬂection of spatial solitons in an AlxGa1−xAs slab waveguide
using 190 fs, 1550 nm pulses which are used to generate and deﬂect the spatial soliton. The steering
beam is focused onto the top of the waveguide near the soliton pathway and the soliton is steered
due to refractive index changes induced by optical Kerr, or free carrier (Drude) eﬀects. Angular
deﬂections up to 8 mR are observed.

Optical spatial solitons are shape-invariant wavepackets
maintained by the balancing of linear and nonlinear op-
tical eﬀects. The nonlinear processes which compensate
for diﬀraction and produce guiding can be induced via,
e.g., an intensity dependent refractive index (Kerr eﬀect),
photorefractive eﬀects or cascaded second order optical
nonlinearities.[1] While interesting objects of study in
themselves, solitons are also being considered for infor-
mation processing applications such as optically recon-
ﬁgurable logic devices [2]. The switching of spatial soli-
tons is an essential process for many applications, and
popular embodiments include nonlinear interactions of
co-propagating spatial solitons [3, 4] or electro-optically
induced pathway distortions. All-optical ultrafast recon-
ﬁguration of soliton pathways, e.g., due to the Kerr eﬀect,
in the telecommunication wavelength regime (1.3-1.6 µm)
is an attractive goal and oﬀers higher switching speeds
compared to electro-optic methods. However, besides the
co-propagating schemes one should consider other tech-
niques that have been discussed in the more general realm
of “light by light’’ switching such as optically or electro-
optically induced birefringence [5, 6], optically induced
prisms [7] or gratings[8].

Here we demonstrate an ultrafast, non-planar switch-
formed in a 2D
ing scheme
AlxGa1−xAs waveguiding layer by inducing a localized
refractive index perturbation in the spatial soliton path-
way using femtosecond light pulses normally incident on
the waveguide. The general principle of the technique is
depicted in Fig. 1 which shows an optical soliton formed
at the entrance facet of a 2D waveguide by an ultra-
short laser pulse. A separate ultrashort pump pulse is
focussed onto the top of the waveguide, introducing an
index change ∆n in the waveguiding layer with the spa-
tial proﬁle of the pump pulse. The ∆n, which can be
generated on either side of the spatial soliton pathway,
causes the soliton to deﬂect while remaining intact: The
robust nature of solitons propagation means that it is not
not necessary to form an optically induced prism of a par-
ticular shape[9]. The deﬂection direction also depends on
the sign of ∆n which is > 0 for the optical Kerr eﬀect and
< 0 for any free carrier (Drude) induced index change in

the index gradient, whereas for ∆n < 0 deﬂection occurs
in the opposite direction. Temporal control of the de-
ﬂection is achieved by delaying the soliton forming pulse
with respect to the pump pulse; temporal resolution is
related to the convolution of both pulses.

The waveguide structure we employ consists of a
1.5 µm thick, 10 mm long (in the
direction)
AlxGa1−xAs waveguiding layer (x = 0.18, band gap =
1.64 eV
756 nm) sandwiched in a 4 µm thick lower
and a 1.5 µm upper cladding both with x = 0.24. The
pulses used to generate and steer the solitons are ob-
tained from an ultrafast laser system: a 250 kHz op-
tical parametric ampliﬁer producing 190 fs pulses, cen-
tered at λ = 1550 nm (photon energy = 0.8 eV). For
soliton formation a 1.4 kW peak power pulse is ellipti-
cally shaped by a cylindrical telescope (to enable good
coupling into the waveguide) and subsequently passed
through a 11 mm focal length lens to obtain an appro-
priate lateral width at the waveguide. The in-plane in-
28 µm (measured at e−1 points) at
tensity diameter is

linear diﬀraction length having a width of
80 µm at the
exit facet. The pump or steering pulse has a peak power
of 220 kW and is focused to a diameter (at e−1points)
of
19 µm polarized parallel to the soliton polarization.
The peak intensity is a factor of ﬁve below the damage
threshold. For maximal deﬂection the center of the pump
pulse focus is located 0.5 mm from the entrance facet and
displaced laterally from the soliton channel so that the
soliton experiences the largest lateral variation in the in-
duced refractive index (see below). The time delay, ∆t,
between the soliton and the pump pulse is controlled with
a delay stage.

Fig. 2 shows the change in the center of the soliton lat-
eral intensity distribution at the exit facet, as a function
of ∆t. The fast, pulse width limited deﬂection towards
the pump beam position near ∆t = 0 is attributed to the
third-order nonlinear optical response, the optical Kerr
eﬀect, and peaks at
4.6 µm. For an estimated peak
focused intensity I0 = 75 GW cm−2 and a Kerr coeﬃ-
10−4 cm2GW−1 we es-
cient of[10] n2(1550nm) = 1.4
timate a peak refractive index change of n2I0 = 0.01.
However, for ∆t larger than the temporal pulse width
the deﬂection reverses, bends away from the pump lo-
cation and achieves a maximum value > 12 µm, due to
the refractive index change induced by free carriers. For
even higher intensities, obtained by tighter focusing of
the pump beam, and yielding higher carrier densities,
deﬂections up to 80 µm have been achieved, correspond-
ing to a deﬂection angle of 8 mR; this is larger than the
soliton diameter by more than a factor of two. The
Drude-based change to the refractive index via free car-
riers of density, N , is most likely due to three-photon
absorption; two-photon absorption is not energetically
allowed. Indeed, from Wherret’s scaling laws[10, 11] for
multiphoton absorption we estimate a 3-photon absorp-

tion coeﬃcient of 0.05 cm3GW−2, so that the injected

carrier density is estimated to be N = 3
From the refractive index change with carrier density[12]
10−21cm3 for 1550 nm, we obtain
dn/dN
a peak refractive index change of σnN = 0.02.

FIG. 3: Scaling of the Kerr- and carrier induced deﬂection
magnitude measured with a position sensitive device.

Fig. 3 shows how the Kerr-induced and carrier-induced
deﬂection amplitudes scale with the focussed pump inten-
sity I0. As expected the former scales linearly with I0,
consistent with a Kerr eﬀect, while the latter scales as
I 3
0 in accord with three photon absorption or a cascaded
three-photon absorption processes. The carrier-induced
response rises on a time scale related to the pulse width,
although it might be noted that there is a “slow’’ (1 ps
rise time) component. This is attributed to cooling of
the carriers, perhaps also involving intervalley scatter-
ing, with the eﬀective mass of conduction band electrons
decreasing and enhancing the Drude contribution to the
refractive index change. The carrier-induced response
remains for the carrier lifetime which is of the order of
several hundreds picoseconds for our sample. With ap-
propriate engineering the recombination time could be re-
duced or carrier induced changes could be enhanced. Al-
ternatively carrier responses can be avoided, by working
with lower peak intensity by e.g., using a larger focal area.
The maximum deﬂection is then limited by the pump
pulse energy and the temporal pulse width. Note that
with the present experiments, the onset of the carrier-
induced refractive index change partly masks the Kerr
eﬀect and the actual Kerr induced deﬂection in Fig. 2 is
likely to be much larger than the 4.6 µm indicated.

A simple estimate of the observed deﬂection for re-
fractive index changes due to the optical Kerr eﬀect
(∆n(I) = n2I) can be given as follows. Consider a pla-
nar slab waveguide contained along the y direction with
light propagating in the z direction as indicated in Fig. 1

change in the refractive index along the x-direction, with
the ultrafast pump and soliton pulses overlapping in time,
in addition to the one already induced by the soliton it-
self, leads to a spatially dependent phase-shift for the
propagating soliton and therefore a refraction towards
the direction of the gradient of the phase-shift. The in-
dex variation induced by a pulse focused onto the waveg-
uide is taken to be of the form ∆n(x, z) = n2I(x, y) =

2.5 mR. This is within a factor of 3 the observed Kerr

induced deﬂection angle of

eﬀect partially obscures the Kerr eﬀect. The deﬂection
angles reported here are comparable to those achieve
with switching techniques involving co-propagating soli-
tons and electrically induced prisms although the inter-
action lengths are much longer[4, 14].

In summary we have demonstrated the feasibility of
all-optical alteration of the pathways of spatial solitons in
two dimensional semiconductor waveguides on an ultra-
fast time scale, employing the optical Kerr nonlinearity
of the medium. The deﬂection scheme reported here does
not require a precise geometrical form for the refractive
index change.
It also oﬀers complementary degrees of
freedom to the co-propagating soliton switching scheme.
In addition we have observed Drude-induced deﬂection of
spatial solitons. The ultrafast temporal nature and par-
ticular geometry of the deﬂection technique enables one
to write and perform information processing applications
using spatial solitons, with the maximum deﬂection angle
limited only by the maximum possible phase shift across
the soliton. By merging the capabilities of the approach
described here with the scheme of optical interconnects
[14] additional applications are possible.

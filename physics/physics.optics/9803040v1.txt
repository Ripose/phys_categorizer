Abstract

The Dirac equation is solved for two novel terms which describe the interaction energy between

the half integral spin of a fermion and the classical, circularly polarized, electromagnetic ﬁeld.

A simple experiment is suggested to test the new terms and the existence of radiation induced

fermion resonance.

——————————–

Recently, Warren et al. [1,2] have made the ﬁrst attempt to detect radiation induced fermion

resonance due to irradiation by a circularly polarized electromagnetic ﬁeld [3-6]. In this Letter

the Dirac equation is solved for one fermion in a classical electromagnetic ﬁeld. Two new terms

are inferred which show the theoretical existence of radiation induced fermion resonance, and

the experimental conditions under which this phenomenon can be detected are deﬁned for an

electron beam.

The demonstration is based on the standard Dirac Hamiltonian operator (Gaussian units),

electromagnetic ﬁeld with vector potential

through the eigenvalue equation,

Hψ = Eψ ,

H′φ = Eφ ,

ψ =

Here ~α and β are the usual Dirac matrices and ψ the four-component Dirac spinor. The rest

energy of the fermion is mc2 and its three momentum is ~p, as usual.

In the usual non-relativistic approximation the calculation proceeds by setting up Eq. (3)

for the proper dominant wavefunction, φ ,

These terms can be interpreted as follows: (H1) is the well-known Schr¨odinger-Pauli Hamil-

tonian; (H2) is the relativistic correction to the kinetic energy; (H3) is the Darwin term; (H4)

gives the spin-orbit coupling term. These four terms are well known corrections to order (v/c)2

of the Schr¨odinger equation (in the electrostatic case). Terms (H5) and (H6) are novel, and rep-

resent the coupling between the half integral fermion spin and the circularly polarized classical

electromagnetic ﬁeld. They give rise to radiation induced fermion resonance, and we will focus

on them.

In S.I. units, terms (H5) and (H6) both give rise to the interaction eigenenergy,

where I is the beam power density (W m−2) and ω its angular frequency (~k is the z-axis versor).
Here µ0 is the vacuum permeability. In deriving Eq. (6) it has been assumed that ~E and ~A are

plane waves in the vacuum and that

For example, if I is 100 watts per square centimeter (106 W m−2 ), and ω is tuned to 1.2815

MHz, ωres occurs at the same frequency. This means that the resonance absorption can be

detected as a decrease in the r.f. output applied to an electron beam. This simple experiment

tests the existence of terms (H5)and (H6) provided that the r.f. output is accurately circularly

polarized. There is no eﬀect expected in linear polarization.

The clear importance of a positive result to this experiment would be that site speciﬁc shifts

[1,2] of easily a megahertz or more could be induced by irradiation in an ESR spectrum, giving

a new analytical technique. The prediction in Eq. (8) can be tested to probably one part in

109 if the resonance frequency can be resolved to a hertz or less. This gives a very severe test

in fundamental physics of the semi-classical Dirac equation; and also of its presumably more

accurate counterparts in quantum electrodynamics and uniﬁed ﬁeld theory.

Similarly, site speciﬁc shifts in the range of perhaps one to a thousand hertz can be induced

in an NMR spectrum [1,2] by pulsing with circularly polarized r.f. radiation. An NMR spec-

trometer has sub-hertzian resolution, so these site speciﬁc shifts should, in theory, lead to a new

analytical technique as was the purpose of Refs. [1] and [2].

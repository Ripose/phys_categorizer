Abstract

By altering the polarization, phase and amplitude at the exit pupil, the inten-
sity distribution near the focal plane of a Solid Immersion Lens(SIL) system
can be changed. We have studied how the resolution and focal depth changes
for a few particular cases. It was seen that by impinging radial polarization
on a SIL system, we may obtain a rotational symmetric z-component of the
focused wavefront with spot size similar to that predicted by scalar theory.
We also observed that it was possible to manipulate the contributions from
the homogeneous and inhomogeneous waves behind the SIL by changing the
amplitude and phase distribution at the aperture.
In this way it may be
possible to improve both the resolution and focal depth of the system.

I. INTRODUCTION

The maximum resolution achievable with conventional optical techniques is determined
by the classical diﬀraction limit. The minimum optical spot diameter can be expressed as
λ/2NA, where λ is the wavelength in air, and NA = nsinα is the numerical aperture(n
is the refractive index and α is the convergence semiangle). Fortunately, the diﬀraction
limit can be circumvented by use of scanning near-ﬁeld optical systems, where resolutions
less than 50nm can be achieved. Unfortunately, near-ﬁeld techniques have been troubled
by low transmission eﬃciencies, and therefore poor signal to noise ratios. Although recent
research have improved the transmission eﬃciency considerably, it is still only 1% at 100nm
spot size [1]. Another way to increase the resolution is by application of a Solid Immersion
Lens(SIL) [2,3]. This method is currently not capable of the same resolution as the near-
ﬁeld techniques, but the light transmission eﬃciency is considerably better. The aim of the
present paper is to describe how the polarization, phase and amplitude at the exit pupil
inﬂuences the intensity distribution near the focal plane of a SIL. Although this is not a
new issue in optics(see ref. [2–4] and references therein), we believe it is of interest to gain
further understanding of SIL-systems as they may become an integral part of the future
data storage systems. Since our focusing system has high NA and the focal point is placed
many wavelengths away from the aperture, the diﬀracted ﬁeld near the focal plane can be
calculated using the Debye approximation [4,5]. Let us consider focusing through a dielectric
interface(see ﬁg. 1). The electric ﬁeld inside medium i(= 1, 2) can be written as [4,5]:

Ei = −

iki
2π Z ZΩi

T (si)exp[iki(sixx + siyy + sizz)]dsixdsiy

(1)

Where ki = 2πni/λ0 is the wavenumber, si = (six, siy, siz) is the unit vector along a typical
ray, Ωi is the solid angle formed by all the geometrical rays, T (si) is the vector pupil
distribution, which accounts for the polarization, phase and amplitude distribution at the
exit pupil. We can ﬁnd the electric ﬁeld near the focal plane by matching the ﬁelds in the
ﬁrst and second medium at the interface, z = −d. The resulting electric ﬁeld in the second
medium becomes [5]:

E2 = C

Z ZΩ1

T (s1x, s1y)
s1z

exp[id(k2s2z − k1s1z)]exp[ik2s2zz]exp[ik1(s1xx + s1yy)]ds1xds1y (2)

C is a complex constant(which will be ignored in the rest of this paper). The unit wave-
vector is deﬁned in spherical coordinates:

si = [sin(θi)cos(φ), sin(θi)sin(φ), cos(θi)]

The position vector can be written as(see also ﬁg. 1):

rc = rc[sin(θc)cos(φc), sin(θc)sin(φc), cos(θc)]

This gives the following diﬀraction integral:

T (θ1, φ) = P (θ1, φ)A(θ1, φ)

where α is the convergence semiangle, P (θ1, φ) is the polarization and A(θ1, φ) represents
the amplitude and phase distribution at the exit pupil. We will for the rest of this paper
assume that our optical system obeys the sine condition, A(θ1) ∝
cos(θ1), see e.g. ref.
[4,5].

κ = n2cos(θ2)cos(θc) + n1sin(θ1)sin(θc)cos(φ − φc)

and

Ψ = d[n2cos(θ2) − n1cos(θ1)]

(6)

(7)

(8)

Ψ represents the aberration function introduced due to the mismatch in refractive index. A
detailed derivation of this integral was ﬁrst presented in reference [5]. We have presented it
in a slightly diﬀerent form to enlight the further discussion in this paper. We will consider
two particular cases: 1)Focusing of electromagnetic waves in a homogeneous media(air). In
this case n1 = n2 = 1. 2)Focusing of electromagnetic waves with a SIL, which means that
d=0(note that n1 > n2). In both cases the aberration function Ψ is identically zero [6].

II. THE INFLUENCE OF POLARIZATION

The state of the polarization incident on the focusing system will inﬂuence the resolution
near the focal plane(see e.g. [4,7]). To discuss this question quantitatively, we must ﬁnd a
general expression for the polarization vector. We assume a incident polarization which may
in general depend on the polar and azimuthal angle:

The polarization vector can be written as [5]:

P(θ1, φ) = R−1[L(2)]−1IL(1)CRP0

which represents the transmission(Fresnel coeﬃcients) through the plane dielectric interface.

This results in:

P(θ1, φ) = 

a[tpcos(θ2)cos2(φ) + tssin2(φ)] + b[tpcos(θ2)sin(φ)cos(φ) − tssin(φ)cos(φ)]
a[tpcos(θ2)cos(φ)sin(φ) − tssin(φ)cos(φ)] + b[tpcos(θ2)sin2(φ) + tscos2(φ)]
−atpsin(θ2)cos(φ) − btpsin(θ2)sin(φ)






In the special case of x-polarized incident light(a = 1 and b=0) this matrix reduces to [5];

P(θ1, φ) = 



1

2(tpcos(θ2) + ts) + 1

1

2(tpcos(θ2) − ts)sin(2φ)
−tpsin(θ2)cos(φ)






It is seen that diﬀerent angles have diﬀerent amplitudes, and that the polarization is depen-
dent on φ. Another possibillity was explored by Quabis et. al. [8], who found that radial
polarized light may increase the resolution. We extend their analysis to a SIL system. We
may write a(φ) = cosφ and b(φ) = sinφ:

When inserted in eq. (5), this gives:

P(θ1, φ) = 

with increasing NA. Let us assume that we are able to ﬁnd a medium which is only sensitive
to the z-component of the polarization. That is, we may use the z-component, and disregard
the x and y-components. Fig. 2 shows the energy density at the bottom surface(the focal
plane) of a SIL with n1 = 2(and n2 = 1), for both radial(solid line) and x-polarized incident
light(the dashed line represents φc = 0◦, whereas the dotted line represents φc = 90◦). In this
example, we assume that α = 60◦ and the wavelength λ0 = 635nm. Fig. 2 indicates that it
is possible to increase the resolution, and perhaps reproduce the result predicted by scalar
theory. However, it is worth noting that in practice one must combine the radial polarizer
in front of the focusing system with an annular aperture, both to increase resolution and to
avoid a singularity on the axis. This was discussed by Quabis et. al. [8]. Therefore, if one
could ﬁnd a material which is sensitive only to the z-component, a more detailed calculation
using an annular aperture is required to determine the real resolution.

III. THE INFLUENCE OF AMPLITUDE AND PHASE

The spatial amplitude and phase distribution(at the exit pupil) will also inﬂuence the
energy distribution near the focal plane(see e.g. [4,7,9]). As with the incident polarization,
there are countless ways to alter the phase and transmittance. We will limit our discussion
to the special class of amplitude/phase ﬁlters called annular apertures(see ref. [10,11] and
references therein). Annular apertures that modiﬁes the transmittance and/or phase dis-
tribution at the exit pupil may improve the resolution at the expense of higher sidelobes.
In this section we will discuss the eﬀect of such an aperture in front of a focusing system
containing a SIL. The transmittance through an annular aperture can be expressed as:

A(θ1) = B(θ1)

if 0 < θ1 < α1
if α1 < θ1 < α2

T1
T2

Ti

where Ti are complex constants(phase and amplitude) for the various zones in the aperture,
and B(θ1) =
cos(θ1). If the incident light is polarized in the x-direction(a=1, b=0), the
resulting ﬁeld can be found by inserting the transmittance into eq. (5):

Where TN +1 is deﬁned to be zero, and we have used that
to derive these
equations. Similar expressions can be applied to the case of radial polarized light. From
eqs. (18), (19) and (20) we can see that the total ﬁeld is a sum of electric ﬁelds from zones
with increasing angular extent, and we expect that the terms with the smallest αi must be
carefully balanced against each other in order to reduce the energy in the sidelobes. For
high NA systems, the z-component becomes particularly important, and may increase the
sidelobe intensity substantially. Thus it is necessary to keep the center peak ratio high in
order to avoid a dominating z-component, which may increase the the sidelobes as well as
the spot size. In total one must not only balance the terms from the various zones, buth
also keep the sidelobes due to the z-(and y)component at an acceptable level. This is a
diﬃcult task, and is best treated by numerical analysis, e.g. by binary search methods [11].
To keep the physics simple, we will limit ourselves to apertures with two and three zones.
The proﬁles(the time-averaged energy density distributions) will be normalized, for simple
comparison between systems.

A. Focusing in a homogenous media

In order to compare with the situations occuring in a SIL-system, we ﬁrst observe what
happens when we place a three-zone aperture in front of a system focusing in a homogeneous
media. As pointed out by Ando [10], the center-peak intensity ratio can be maximized by
using a phase aperture, and the sidelobes can be made small by maintaining the same phase
for the light passing through the center and outer portion of the aperture. On the basis of
these results, let us assume that T1 = 1, T2 = −1 and T3 = 1. Such an aperture can be
produced by e.g.
lithographical methods, and was experimentally tested by Ando et. al.
[12]. Let α1 = 15◦, α2 = 30◦, α3 = 60◦ and λ0 = 635nm. Fig. 3 shows the focused beam
proﬁle for the three-zone phase aperture when φc = 0◦(solid line) and φc = 90◦(dash-dotted
line). For comparison we have also plotted the proﬁle of the focused beam with no aperture
when φc = 0◦(dashed line) and φc = 90◦(dotted line). The resolution due to the three-zone
aperture is improved as compared to no aperture, but the peak sidelobe intensity is almost
20%. We could probably bring this number down by increasing the number of zones in
the annular aperture. Fig. 4 shows the axial energy density distribution for the three-zone
annular aperture(solid line) and no annular aperture(dashed line). Note that the focal depth
is larger with the three-zone aperture.

B. Focusing with a SIL

The last ten years much research has been done on SIL systems [2,3,13–15]. As mentioned
in the introduction, a major goal has been to improve the resolution and focal depth. To
that end, an interesting possibility is the application of an annular aperture in front of a SIL.
As have been pointed out by Milster et al [3], plane waves incident on the bottom surface
of the SIL will experience total reﬂection above the critical angle, θc = arcsin(n2/n1).
Thus we may divide the plane waves at the exit pupil into two parts; a homogeneous part
where the angles are smaller than the critical angle at the interface, and an inhomogeneous
part where the plane waves experience total reﬂection at the interface, corresponding to
evanescent waves below the bottom surface of the SIL. Let us ﬁrst see what happens when
we put a simple two-zone annular aperture with T1 = 0 and T2 = 1 in front of the SIL. The
dotted lines in ﬁgs. 5 and 6 show the transverse proﬁles behind the bottom surface of the
SIL(n1 = 2.0, n2 = 1.0 and λ0 = 635nm) when φc = 0◦ and φc = 90◦, respectively. We
assume that α1 = 54◦ and α2 = 60◦. For comparison, the proﬁles for a SIL with no annular
aperture are also shown(the dashed lines in ﬁgs. 5 and 6). Note that as the center(dark) disk
increases, the proﬁle becomes more compressed, but the sidelobes increases. The increase
in resolution is more pronounced when φc = 90◦ than φc = 0◦, since the z-component of the
electric ﬁeld depends on cosφc(which is zero when φc = 90◦, see eq. (17)). Fig. 7 shows
the axial distribution behind the SIL with(dotted line) or without(dashed line) a two-zone
annular aperture. When the center disk increases, the focal depth decreases, contrary to
what happens during focusing in a homogeneous media [9]. This behaviour occur since
the evanescent waves becomes more dominating when we block out the homogeneous waves,
and since the amplitude of evanescent waves are decreasing exponentially behind the SIL. To
increase the light transmission eﬃciency, one may replace the two-zone amplitude aperture
with an axicon, thus creating a bright ring.

Next we place a three-zone phase aperture(with the same properties as in the previous
section) in front of the SIL. In particular, we are interested in observing what happens
when 1)α1 < α2 ≤ θc and 2)α2 > α1 ≥ θc. The ﬁrst case(α1 < α2 ≤ θc) is in some ways
similar to focusing in a homogeneous media. That is, we expect the spot size to decrease, if
the convergence semiangles have proper values. However, we also expect the focal depth to
decrease, since we balance terms with homogeneous waves against each other, thus increasing
the importance of the evanescent waves. As an example, let us consider the same SIL-system
as above, but now replace the two-zone aperture with a three-zone annular aperture with
α1 = 20◦, α2 = 30◦ and α3 = 60◦ . The dash-dotted lines in ﬁgs. 5 and 6 shows the resulting
proﬁles when φc = 0◦ and φc = 90◦, respectively. Note that the proﬁle is slightly smaller
than the dashed line(no annular aperture) when φc = 90◦, whereas for φc = 0◦ it is slightly
larger. The dash-dotted line in ﬁg. 7 shows the axial distribution. As expected, the focal
depth is smaller with the annular aperture.

In the second case(α2 > α1 ≥ θc) the opposite behaviour may take place. That is, we are
able to balance terms with inhomogeneous waves against each other, thus increasing the im-
portance of the homogeneous waves. In this way we can produce some kind of enhancement
of the focal depth, and if the the angles α1 and α2 are properly chosen, the beam proﬁle may
become narrower as well. As an example we consider an annular aperture with α1 = 31◦
and α2 = 43◦. The solid lines in ﬁgs. 5 and 6 are representing the transverse proﬁles when

7

φc = 0◦ and φc = 90◦, respectively. Now the situation is almost opposite compared with the
previous annular aperture. That is, the proﬁle is smaller than the dashed line(no aperture)
when φc = 0◦, but larger when φc = 90◦. The axial distribution(solid line in ﬁg. 7) is
decaying more slowly than with no annular aperture, which conﬁrms the discussion above.

IV. CONCLUSION

The choice of incident polarization, phase and amplitude may change the intensity dis-
tribution near the focal plane of a focusing system. It was seen that by impinging radial
polarization on a SIL system, we may obtain a rotational symmetric z-component of the fo-
cused wavefront with spot size similar to that predicted by scalar theory. We also discussed
how annular apertures may change the resolution and focal depth. It was shown that when
we place a three-zone phase aperture in front of a focusing system, both the resolution and
focal depth may increase. When applied to SIL-systems, we observed that it was possible to
manipulate the contributions from the homogeneous and inhomogeneous waves behind the
SIL by changing the phase and transmittance distribution at the aperture. In this way it
may be possible to improve both the resolution and focal depth. Future investigations may
be directed towards the use of more than three zones to improve the resolution and focal
depth. We would like to point out that only a few special cases were discussed in this paper,
and that our examples were not optimized for any particular applications.

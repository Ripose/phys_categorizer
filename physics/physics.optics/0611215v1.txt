We construct combined electric and magnetic ﬁeld variables which independently represent energy
ﬂows in the forward and backward directions respectively, and use these to re-formulate Maxwell’s
equations. These variables enable us to not only judge the eﬀect and signiﬁcance of backward-
travelling ﬁeld components, but also to discard them when appropriate. They thereby have the
potential to simplify numerical simulations, leading to potential speed gains of up to 100% over
standard FDTD or PSSD simulations. We present results for various illustrative situations, includ-
ing an example application to second harmonic generation in periodically poled lithium niobate.
These ﬁeld variables are also used to derive both envelope equations useful for narrow-band pulse
propagation, and a second order wave equation. Alternative deﬁnitions are also presented.

INTRODUCTION

We introduce electro-magnetic ﬁeld variables ~G± that
are designed to have directional characteristics. These
variables have the potential to speed up numerical sim-
ulations, while providing valuable insight into the pro-
cess of optical pulse propagation at the same time. Sim-
ple plane-polarized versions of ~G± for a dispersionless
medium were originally proposed by Fleck at the begin-
ning of ref. [1], although he did not use them in the rest
of the paper. In the generalized form deﬁned below, it is
possible to use them to advantage in practical situations.
We note that a diﬀerent approach to directional pulse
propagation based on projection operators was proposed
[2, 3]; there is also the recent work of
by Kolesik et.al.
[4] based on a second order wave equa-
Ferrando et.al.
tion.

The essential characteristic of ~G+ and ~G− is that they
represent energy ﬂuxes directed in the forward and back-
ward directions respectively. This implies that ~G+ is the
appropriate variable to use in situations where pulses are
travelling only in the forward direction. Indeed, as we
will explain, optimal construction of ~G+ makes ~G− neg-
ligible under these circumstances, and the computational
eﬀort can then be halved by neglecting ~G− altogether.

If we apply a z-propagated pseudospectral spatial-
domain (PSSD) algorithm [5], we also gain a fast and ﬂex-
ible treatment of dispersion and nonlinear eﬀects, which
signiﬁcantly outperforms standard ﬁnite diﬀerence time-
domain (FDTD) methods [6, 7]. Further, since many au-
thors (including the recent [3]) assume that the backward
ﬁeld is negligible in any case, the explicit appearance of
~G− within our formalism provides a direct test of the
validity of this assumption. A further advantage of ~G±
is that it is as easy to include magneto-optic eﬀects as
electro-optic eﬀects such as dispersion and nonlinearity.

It is in situations involving both electro- and magneto-
optic eﬀects where we achieve the greatest computational
speed increase – potentially up to 100% faster. Moreover,
even if one chooses to propagate an optical pulse using
E and H, it is still easy to analyse its directional charac-
teristic by constructing ~G± after the event.

After reviewing Fleck’s original form of the ~G± vari-
ables at the start of section II, we proceed to discuss
how to represent the permittivity and permeability of
the medium; this is a crucial step in the optimal con-
struction of ~G± in a generalized form. The treatment of
nonlinearities and the calculation of energy and ﬂux are
also covered.

In Section III, we derive a ﬁrst-order wave equation,
both in a form that is fully equivalent to Maxwell’s equa-
tions, and in a more useful one that is applicable in the
transverse ﬁeld limit. In section IV, we demonstrate a
simple procedure for the numerical implementation of
~G± simulations; techniques for specifying initial condi-
tions and for handling dispersion and nonlinear eﬀects
are examined in detail. We take as an example the
case of second harmonic generation in periodically-poled
lithium niobate, to demonstrate that our method can be
applied to practical as well as illustrative simulations. In
all cases, we retain both ~G+ and ~G−, but show that with
optimal construction, ~G− can be made negligible.

In section V we derive a propagation equation for en-
velopes based on ~G±; in section VI we develop a second
order wave equation; and in section VII we propose al-
ternative deﬁnitions for ﬁeld variables with directional
properties. Finally, in section VIII, we present our con-
clusions.

which shows that G+ and G− are associated with positive
and negative energy ﬂux respectively. Unfortunately, if
eqn. (1) is used to describe a forward-propagating pulse
in a dispersive medium, it will contain signiﬁcant con-
tributions from both G+ and G−. We therefore need to
generalize the construction in order to make the concept
useful in practical situations.

A. Medium Parameters

The deﬁnitions of G± (and their generalized vector
counterparts ~G±, introduced below) depend on the prop-
erties of the propagation medium through the permittiv-
ity ǫ and permeability µ. In principle it would be attrac-
tive to deﬁne ~G± using the exact values of ǫ, µ (including
the nonlinearity), but this is usually impractical, and we
will instead use “reference” values ǫr, µr, chosen to be
as close as practicable to the true medium properties,
typically by including all the dispersive properties.

In the frequency domain (indicated by tildes), we

write

˜ǫ

˜µ

= ˜ǫr(ω) + ˜ǫc(ω) = ˜α2
= ˜µr(ω) + ˜µc(ω) = ˜β2

r(ω) + ˜αr(ω) ˜αc(ω), (3)
r (ω) + ˜βr(ω) ˜βc(ω),
(4)

where the correction parameters ˜ǫc and ˜µc represent the
discrepancy between the true values and the reference.
The smaller these correction terms are, the better the
match, and the more likely it is that a description involv-
ing only G+ will suﬃce. Note that since the deﬁnitions of
G± depend on the square roots of ˜ǫ and ˜µ, we introduce
the ˜α and ˜β parameters, which will feature prominently
(along with their time domain counterparts α, β), in the
generalized deﬁnitions of ~G± that follow.

By using these frequency dependent parameters in the
generalized deﬁnitions of G±, we are able to propagate
pulses using only the G+ variable, a gain in both math-
ematical simplicity and computational speed.

apply tildes to the spectral forms of the ﬁeld quantities

ω) or the context, to distinguish between domains.

We note that this is zero when the ρ and ~J are zero, as
long as there is no longitudinal electric ﬁeld.

Diﬀerent choices of ˜ǫr, ˜µr produce diﬀerent ~G± pairs.
Whilst using the true values to describe a forward prop-
agating pulse results in ~G− = 0, any other choice of
reference will produce a non-zero ~G− component that
co-propagates with ~G+. Note that this ~G− still has an
~u), but
energy ﬂux directed in the reverse direction (
travels forwards with the ~G+ with which it is tightly cou-
pled.

−

We will almost always choose ˜ǫr, ˜µr to include the en-
tire linear dispersion of the medium. We exclude the
nonlinearity because it removes the ability to reconstruct
~E, ~H ﬁelds uniquely from the ~G±, as can be seen from
eqns. (5, 7, 9, 10), which will become nonlinear in ~E and
~H.

The vectorized deﬁnitions of ~G± accommodate any po-
larization of the E and H ﬁelds. For propagation along
the z axis, the x component of ~G± (G±
x ) will contain Ex
and Hy; and similarly G±
y , will contain Ey and Hx. It
is then a simple matter to see how linearly or circularly
polarized ~E and ~H ﬁelds can be represented in terms of
~G±. The deﬁnitions are also easily generalized to include
birefringent media, provided the propagation direction
and transverse coordinate axes are such that ǫr and µr
become diagonal matrices.

Finally, note that ~G± bear some resemblance to Bel-
[8, 9, 10]) which are deﬁned

trami variables (see e.g.

as ~Q = √ǫ ~E + ı√µ ~H; but they diﬀer in two important
respects. First, a given Beltrami ~Q deﬁnes ~E and ~H
uniquely, whereas both ~G+ and ~G− are needed to do the
same. Secondly, ~Q does not assume any preferred direc-
tion, whereas the ~G± variables include the direction ~u in
their deﬁnition. Further, Beltrami variables are not de-
ﬁned using the full time (or frequency) dependence of ǫ, µ
as we use for ~G± in eqns. (5, 7), although presumably
this would be possible.

C. Nonlinearities

Since it is usually impractical to include nonlinearities
in the reference parameters, these will normally appear
in the correction terms ǫc, µc. As an example, consider
a n-th order (electric) nonlinearity, in which case ǫc(t) =
χ(n)(t)

E(t)n−1, and

where F[...] is the Fourier transform (FT) from time to
frequency, and E(t) can be found from eqn. (9). If the
reference parameters ˜αr contain dispersion (which will
be the typical case), we can see from eqn.
(12) that
this will make ˜αc(ω) dispersive even if χ(n) is instanta-
neous. In the case of an instantaneous nonlinearity, this
adds more computational work (an extra two FTs), al-
though for non-instantaneous ones we needed the FTs
anyway.
If the nonlinearity is instantaneous and the
reference parameters are non-dispersive, we have simply

interpretation that for particular ~E and ~H ﬁelds, ~G+ cor-
responds to the energy ﬂux directed forward (along ~u),
and ~G− to ﬂux directed backward. The need for this
distinction between the direction of the ﬂux due to a ~G±
ﬁeld, and its direction of travel has already arisen in II B
above.

We can also calculate the energy density of the EM

~G−

For a dispersive reference, the relevant formulae for ~S
and U are relatively complicated because of the appear-
ance of cross terms and/or convolutions. However, this
should not produce a signiﬁcant overhead in numerical
simulations because the code will be switching between
time and frequency domains at each step, allowing ~S and
U to be calculated in whatever way is most eﬃcient.

D. Energy and Flux

The ~G± are intrinsically directional and do not rely
on a carrier wave to impart their directionality. This
becomes clear when the Poynting vector is expressed in
terms of ~G±. For transverse ﬁelds and dispersive refer-
ence parameters, we obtain

E. Co-moving frame

We now consider using a moving reference frame. This
is particularly useful in a space-propagated model where
the pulse is held as a function of time, since it will stay
nearly centered when propagating forwards. A simple
choice of frame speed might be the phase velocity at the
centre frequency of the pulse, which minimises the mo-
tion of the carrier-like oscillations; however, the pulse as
a whole will move within the frame because of its dif-
ferent group velocity. The frame translation for a speed
cf = 1/αf βf is

where γ is the distance travelled in the direction of ~u.

We now separate the correction components (depend-
ing on ˜αc, ˜βc) from the reference components (depending
on ˜αr, ˜βr), and substitute expressions containing ~G±, G◦
by referring to eqns. (9) and (10). We also note that the
terms involving ~G± decouple from those involving G◦.
Hence

ξ = αf βf /αrβr.

~G± =

∓

If we choose to give αf and βf a frequency depen-
dence, we have deﬁned a “dispersive frame”, where dif-
ferent frequency components travel at diﬀerent speeds.
In such a frame, any matching dispersive evolution (i.e.
where αf = αr and βf = βr) results in no change to the
pulse proﬁle. However, at the end of the simulation, we
need to transform from the dispersive frame back into a
normal (non-dispersive) laboratory frame. Moreover, us-
ing a dispersive frame can give rise to numerical stability
problems.

III. FIRST ORDER WAVE EQUATION

We now derive a set of ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equa-
tions for the forward and backward directed ﬁelds ~G±,
and use the moving frame set out above in eqns. (21,
22). We assume that the medium is continuous, so that
∂zǫ = ∂zµ = 0, where ∂q
d/dq. This does not impose
a signiﬁcant restriction in practice, since a simulation
propagated forwards in space can easily handle interfaces
between diﬀerent media.

A. Derivation

For a vector derivation of propagation equations
for ~G±, we start with the two relevant (source free)
Maxwell’s equations. Writing them in frequency space,
with ˜α2 = ˜ǫ and ˜β2 = ˜µ; and taking the cross product of
~u and the

~H equation yields

For propagation along the z axis, in the plane polarized
(Ex, Hy) limit, the curl becomes ∂z, and ~G± is replaced
with G±
x . In the transverse ﬁeld case, eqn. (31) (or (29))
can be ignored.

The equations above are written to suggest a spatially
directed propagation (along ~u), and indeed are most
straightforwardly solved that way. However, a simple
rearrangement of the terms leads to a t-directed propa-
gation model, although, in its present form, the time-like
(30) is obscured. Whilst t-directed
evolution of eqn.
propagation has some advantages, it makes the treat-
ment of dispersion and other time-memory eﬀects more
demanding, as discussed by Kolesik and Moloney [3] and
Tyrrell et.al. [5].

This is the diﬀerence of the source-free divergences for

sis. Clearly, however, our basis of ~G±, G◦ is most useful
for ﬁelds propagating mainly along one axis (i.e. ~u), par-
ticularly in the limit of transverse ﬁelds, where only eqn.

One nice property of this equation is that matching the
frame velocity to the phase velocity causes the carrier-like
oscillations in the forward travelling ﬁelds G+ to freeze
in place, leaving only the evolution due to the correction
terms. If we are prepared to make the common assump-
tion of only forward-travelling pulses, we will have man-
aged to greatly reduce the rate of change of the ﬁelds.
This in turn will allow coarser numerical resolutions to
be employed in numerical simulations, leading to signiﬁ-
cant speed advantages over and above those obtained by
assuming G− = 0.

D. Time vs space propagation

In FDTD solutions of Maxwell’s equations, optical
pulses travel either forwards or backwards in space as
they propagate (or march) forward with time. However,
most nonlinear optical simulations are done in a space-
propagated picture; with the consequence that optical
pulses travel either forwards or backwards in time as
the calculations propagate (march) through space.

Since we follow the space-propagated picture, the pulse
travelling forward in time will be described by G+, and
the one travelling backward by G−.

Note that any backward travelling pulse in a z-
propagated picture is travelling backwards in time while
propagating forwards in space. Although at ﬁrst this
might seem non-causal, it is in fact the way that the
simulation represents a pulse which we would normally
describe as propagating backwards (i.e. in the direction
~u). This is clear from the wave equations; swapping the
−
sign of the propagation direction ~u swaps the behaviour
of ~G+ and ~G−.

E. Decoupled Wave Equations

We can make the most of our approach by decou-
pling ~G+ from ~G−, enabling the two ﬁrst-order coupled
Maxwell’s eqns. (24, 25) or ~G± eqns. (28) (or co-moving
form eqn.
(34)) to be reduced to two uncoupled ﬁrst-
order equations. The equation describing propagation in
the “uninteresting ”direction can then be discarded, leav-
ing one ﬁrst-order equation where there were originally
two.

This step requires an approximation, although since we
can perfectly match the reference parameters (αr, βr) to
the material dispersion, it is not a very stringent one.
Since the correction parameters αc, βc depend only on
nonlinear eﬀects, they will in general be small, keeping
cross coupling between ~G+ and ~G− minimal. Further,
whilst the ~G+ ﬁeld will rotate forwards according to its
wavevector (i.e. e+ıkz, with k = αrβrω), the ~G− ﬁeld will
rotate backwards at the same rate (i.e. at e−ıkz). This
means the correction terms for ~G+ will contain both an
in-sync component from ~G+, and a component from ~G−
with a large detuning. Since this detuning (amounting
to e−2ıkz) will usually be large compared to the spatial
bandwidth of the pulse, we can apply a rotating wave
approximation and average the ~G− contribution to zero.
After applying the same steps to the ~G− equation as well,
eqn. (28) becomes

IV. SIMULATING G±

We now examine the procedure needed to simulate
wave propagation using the G± variables. This will clar-
ify various practical issues as well as illuminate some of
the less-obvious features of our approach. We consider a
plane-polarized EM wave propagating along z in a non-
magnetic medium with dispersion and a weak nonlinear-
ity. Since our aim is to explain the fundamental principles
of the use of G± variables, we ﬁrst present a number of
simple examples.

Our numerical simulations of the G± wave equations
are implemented by straightforward adaption of the
PSSD technique [5]. In PSSD, ﬁelds are stored as func-
tions of time, and fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) are
used to convert to the frequency domain for the calcula-
tion of pseudospectral derivatives and the eﬀects of dis-
persion. This technique allows the simple application of
arbitrary dispersion, which becomes a simple multipli-
cation in frequency space. Fields are then transformed
back to the time domain, where the nonlinear eﬀects
are calculated, before propagating the ﬁelds forward in
space. Computational details, such as how to design the
mesh and control the accuracy of the simulations are well

known (e.g. the Courant and Nyquist criteria), and can
be found in a range of sources (e.g. [13, 14]).

When applied to G± ﬁelds,

the basic spatially-
propagated PSSD algorithm does not change, but the
wave equation to be solved is now eqn. (30) instead of
Maxwell’s equations. This means that the full ﬂexibility
of PSSD is harnessed with the advantages of G± ﬁelds to
give a powerful and eﬃcient combination.

A. Simulation speed

The computational speed of any PSSD-type propaga-
tion depends primarily on the time spent doing FTs. In
the PSSD technique described in [5], ﬁve FTs are used,
two forward and back pairs, and one (forward only) to
calculate the derivative of the electric displacement D.
If magnetic dispersion were present, PSSD would require
an extra FT for the magnetic induction B, making six
FTs in all.

In contrast, a G+ simulation requires only three FTs.
This comprises two forward FTs which are used to cal-
culate the derivative for the dispersion and nonlinearity,
and one backward FT is used to change back into the
time domain; the two derivatives are combined in the fre-
quency domain where the problem becomes linear. Such
a simulation will therefore run 67% faster than the cor-
responding E and H PSSD algorithm; or 100% if there
is also magnetic dispersion.

To include both G+ and G− would require six FTs; one
more than the usual PSSD case, but the same if magnetic
dispersion needs to be included.

B.

Implementation

As a ﬁrst step, we divide the total permittivity into
three: a reference component with constant permittivity
˜ǫr, a linear dispersion correction ˜ǫD
c (ω), and an instanta-
neous nonlinearity ˜ǫN L
; the permeability has the vacuum
value µ0. The medium properties can therefore be rep-
resented in the following fashion

c

˜ǫ(ω) = ˜ǫr + ˜ǫD
= ˜α2

c (ω) + ˜ǫN L

c

r + ˜αr ˜αD

c (ω) + ˜αr ˜αN L

c

(36)
(37)

This particular breakdown of ˜ǫ is for illustrative pur-
poses only; in practice, we would choose a dispersive ref-
erence and try to leave only nonlinear terms in the cor-
rection parameters (i.e. use ˜ǫ(ω) = ˜ǫr(ω) + ˜ǫN L
). We
might also regroup various terms to optimise the numer-
ical performance.

If the frame velocity is chosen to be the same as the
phase velocity given by the reference parameters, the
G+
x ﬁeld no longer undergoes any reference evolution as
it propagates. This contrasts with the usual approach,
which is to match the frame velocity to the group veloc-
ity. However, with our choice of reference parameters, the
group velocity corrections appear in the second RHS term
as part of ˜αD
c . If we were to propagate G±
x in a group ve-
locity frame, we would retain part of the reference term,
which would then cancel with part of the group velocity
contribution from the dispersion term. This could lead to
a better overall cancellation, just as in the usual E ﬁeld
approaches. If that were our aim, we could indeed easily
rearrange eqn. (38) to incorporate such a cancellation,
and then solve the equation appropriately.

The next step is to solve for the linear dispersion αD
c =
˜ǫD
c /αr. Fortunately, this part of the equation is also easy
to solve exactly in the frequency domain, through the

Although both reference and dispersion steps can be
solved using exponentials, there is an important diﬀer-
ence. The reference evolution of G+ depends only on
G+, whereas the dispersion evolution depends on the sum
G++G−, since the dispersion acts on the electric ﬁeld. In
a forward-only approximation where G− = 0, it is trivial
to combine these ﬁrst two steps, as in most approaches
to solving for the propagation of optical pulses.

The third and ﬁnal step is performed by transforming
into the time domain and solving for the n-th order non-
linear eﬀects. Since the reference αr, βr are constants,
c = χ(n)En−1/αr, a simple Euler method gives

For a narrow-band ﬁeld centred at ω0, the time deriva-

tive would be dominated by (and proportional to) ω0. In
most envelope theories we see only this factor ω0 in the
analogous expression; although correction terms exist for
wider-band ﬁelds [11, 12].

Initial conditions: matching a pulse to the

medium

Most descriptions of pulse propagation start with ini-
tial conditions chosen to represent a pulse travelling for-
ward in the medium. Here we consider how to choose the
best initial conditions for G± in the case of a pulse trav-
elling only in the forward ~u direction. They are based on
the best practical parameterization of the medium ˜ǫi(ω),
˜µi(ω), which need not be the same as ˜ǫr and ˜µr. Assum-
ing only the electric ﬁeld E(ω) of the pulse is known, the
procedure is:
(1) Choose ˜ǫi and ˜µi to be as close as possible to the
actual medium parameters ˜ǫ, ˜µ. One might even try to
put the nonlinear properties into ˜ǫi and ˜µi as well, but
only if one can get a solution for steps (2) and (3) below
with this added complication.
(2) Calculate H(ω) corresponding to E(ω) for a forward
travelling pulse, so that a G− based on ˜ǫi, ˜µi would be
zero:

H(ω) =

˜ǫi(ω)
˜µi(ω)

−s

E(ω).

(42)

(3) Calculate an initial G± using the chosen reference
parameters ǫr(ω) and µr(ω), given our initial E(ω) and
H(ω) ﬁelds:

G± =

˜ǫr(ω)

˜µr(ω)

±

˜ǫi(ω)
˜µi(ω) #

s

E(ω).

(43)

p

p
Note that step (3) is unnecessary if ˜ǫi = ˜ǫr and ˜µi = ˜µr.
Notwithstanding step (2), G− is only eliminated from
the simulation if both ˜ǫi and ˜µi are perfect matches to
the material parameters. If the (˜ǫi, ˜µi) values are good,
but (˜ǫr, ˜µr) less so, a weak G− ﬁeld will co-propagate
forwards with G+, even though the Poynting vector of
the G− is directed backwards. If (˜ǫi, ˜µi) is a bad match
as well, the initial G− will have a component that travels
backwards, its magnitude corresponding to that of the re-
ﬂection between a medium with parameters (˜ǫi, ˜µi) and
one with the actual parameters. Since it is usually pos-
sible to include all the linear dispersive properties in ˜ǫi,
˜µi, any discrepancy is likely to be due to the nonlinear
contribution, and consequently very small.

Figure 1 shows how diﬀerent choices of reference pa-
rameter aﬀect the G± ﬁelds required to model a simple
forward-propagating few-cycle pulse at 500nm in fused
silica. Note that although the G± ﬁelds in (a) and (b)
are directly proportional to E and H, in (c), the use of
a dispersive reference means that a deconvolution would
be needed (if in the time-domain) to transform from G±
to E and H.

In ﬁgure 1(a), the mismatch between the reference pa-
1.5
rameters (with n = 1) and the actual medium (n
at the 500 nm pulse center wavelength) causes a signif-
icant co-propagating G− component to appear; this is
improved in (b) where the reference parameters specify a

≈

7

constant refractive index close to that at the centre fre-
quency of the initial pulse. Since the mismatch between
the reference and the true material properties is due only
to the material dispersion, the initial co-propagating G−
component is smaller in ﬁgure 1(b) than in ﬁgure 1(a).
The reduction in the size of G− is rather smaller than
might be expected, mainly because although fused silica
has a refractive index of about 1.5 at 500nm, we have
used non-dispersive reference parameters with a refrac-
tive index of 1.5 at all frequencies.

In ﬁgure 1(b), although the construction of G± has
the phase velocity reasonably well matched, the group
velocity of the pulse is poorly matched. In addition there
is a smaller eﬀect caused by the wide-band nature of the
pulse, where the reference parameters are (even) less well
matched to frequency components away from the center
frequency.

FIG. 1: A 500nm pulse in fused silica, represented with (a) a
vacuum reference, (b) a ﬁxed refractive index reference (c) a
perfectly matched dispersive reference. In all cases the initial-
ization parameters are those that perfectly match the disper-
sive properties of the medium. Solid line: G+ ﬁeld. Dashed
line: G− ﬁeld.

The conclusion is that, for any pulse propagating in
a material whose dispersion is not perfectly matched
by the reference over the pulse bandwidth, a ﬁnite co-
propagating G− will appear. This will be made up of fre-
quency components whose phase velocity in the medium
do not match the phase velocity given by the reference.
Thus, in typical dispersive media, only very narrow-band

pulses result in a negligible G− for non-dispersive refer-
ence parameters. However, the mismatch between the
reference and the true material properties can be com-
pletely removed by using a dispersive reference identical
to that of the material being simulated. The results of
this are shown in ﬁgure 1(c), where G− is identically zero.

D. Dispersive propagation

We now present a variety of numerical results demon-
strating pulse propagation in a dispersive medium. We
take the medium to have the properties of fused silica,
but we do not include nonlinear eﬀects for the moment.
Our aim is to give a ﬂavour of what the G± ﬁelds look
like for diﬀerent reference parameters. The choice of ref-
erence is important because, as explained earlier, if the
reference is not perfectly matched to the actual medium,
a forward travelling pulse will contain a G− wave co-
propagating with the main G+ component. Usually we
will want to choose a reference that makes G− negligible,
so we can save computational eﬀort.

We deliberately choose ultra-short pulses containing
only a few optical cycles to demonstrate the ﬂexibility of
our method in the short pulse limit.

Figure 2 shows the results for the ﬁelds in ﬁg. 1 after
propagating 15µm in fused silica with the nonlinearity
In all cases, the initial size of G− is broadly
ignored.
maintained and, in particular, it remains zero when the
reference parameters are perfectly matched. Although
the G± ﬁelds in 2(a) and 2(b) are directly proportional
to E and H, in (c), the use of a dispersive reference means
that in that case a deconvolution is needed to transform
from G± to E and H.

We can also consider the eﬀect of neglecting a ﬁnite
(but signiﬁcant) G− ﬁeld, where the G+ part of the pulse
then undergoes the wrong dispersion. This is because the
dispersive correction part (see e.g. eqn. (38)) depends on
G+ + G−, and thus, without G−, will be either too big or
too small. This problem is avoided by using a dispersive
reference identical to that of the material being simu-
lated. The results of this are shown in ﬁgure 2(c), where
G− is always identically zero and no approximation is
necessary to omit G−.

In ﬁgure 3 we show the result for a simulation with
both a perfectly matched dispersive reference and a per-
fectly matched dispersive frame. Since all the material
properties are included in the reference parameters, and
we pick a frame that exactly matches the propagation,
ﬁg. 3 looks identical to the initial state in ﬁg. 1(c). We
can recover the expected lab-frame ﬁnal state by trans-
forming ﬁg. 3 out of its dispersive frame, and so get a
graph identical to ﬁg. 2(c).

The main message from these simulations is that the
better matched the reference parameters are to the ma-
terial parameters, the smaller the co-propagating G−.
For a perfectly matched reference, the co-propagating
G− vanishes. Also, the better matched the frame is to

the material parameters, the slower the evolution of the
pulse shape. However, we then have to do more work
to transform the ﬁnal state of the pulse (in its moving
frame) into the stationary-frame counterpart we would
see in the lab – although for a linearly dispersive frame,
the transformation is straightforward.

E. Nonlinear propagation

We now demonstrate some simple pulse propagations
in nonlinear media. Since neither the initial conditions
(determined by ǫi, µi) nor the reference parameters (de-

9

termined by ǫr, µr) include the nonlinearity, the pulse
is not perfectly forward propagating, and a small “re-
ﬂection” occurs as the pulse starts propagating in the
nonlinear medium.

Figure 4 shows how pulses similar to those in ﬁg. 1
look after propagating 10µm through fused silica. The
pulse parameters were adjusted to give a clearer ﬁnal
pulse shape. We see the same pattern as in ﬁgs 1 and 2,
where a weak G− remains except for perfectly matched
reference parameters. Note, however, that the addition
of nonlinearity does not cause the size of the G− ﬁeld to
change signiﬁcantly during propagation.

periodically poled at 6.05µm. Clockwise from top left: initial
pulse, ﬁnal pulse, second harmonic power, ﬁnal pulse spec-
trum. Solid line: G+ ﬁeld. Dot-dashed line: G− ﬁeld.

F. Some remarks on layered media

A complication arises when propagating a pulse
through layers of material with signiﬁcantly diﬀerent dis-
persions. Because the ~G± deﬁnitions are carefully con-
structed to match the propagation medium, ~G± variables
ideal for one layer (and so ensuring ~G− = 0) will not be
ideal for another. This gives us two options: (a) either
retain the ~G− ﬁeld in the description, or (b) at each layer
boundary, switch to a set of ~G± variables matched to that
medium. Option (a) is simpler, but it is not necessarily
computationally eﬃcient and leads to complications in-
volving reﬂections from the interfaces. Option (b) is more
eﬃcient computationally when we are only interested in
the forward-going pulse, as the eﬀort involved in switch-
ing ~G± deﬁnitions is comparable to only a single spatial

FIG. 4: A similar pulse as above, after propagating 10µm
through fused silica; represented in (a) a vacuum reference,
(b) a ﬁxed refractive index reference (n = 1.5), (c) a per-
fectly matched dispersive reference. Parameters have been
adjusted to give a clearer ﬁnal pulse shape. Solid line: G+
ﬁeld. Dashed line: G− ﬁeld.

We now apply our approach to the practical problem
of second harmonic generation in 120µm of periodically
poled lithium niobate. The results are shown on ﬁgure
5, and agree with the simulations of Tyrrell et.al. [5].

step in the ongoing propagation calculation.

G. Justifying the forward-only approximation

The ability to accurately incorporate dispersion into
our reference permittivity allows great control over the
magnitude of the G− ﬁeld. Our tests have shown that
we can conﬁdently neglect G− if our construction of G±
accurately includes the medium dispersion, although pos-
sible exceptions may occur in cases involving extremely
strong nonlinearities.

This can be seen in the case of periodically poled
lithium niobate discussed above (see ﬁg. 5), where the
ratio of the G− to G+ intensities was 1 : 106. An even
more rigorous test of G+’s ability to accurately simulate
short pulse propagation was our recent study of the ef-
fects of dispersion on carrier shocking [15]. Despite the
strong nonlinear eﬀects, and signiﬁcant distortion to the
pulse proﬁles, G+ simulations consistently produced re-
sults in agreement with PSSD – whilst still only requiring
half the computational eﬀort.

The ability to accurately model pulse propagation us-
ing only G+ after carefully choosing a reference permit-
tivity clearly justiﬁes neglecting G−, which in turn sim-
pliﬁes numerical simulations.

V. ENVELOPE PROPAGATION EQUATION

When computing the interaction of narrow-band ﬁelds,
it is common to remove chosen carrier frequencies, and to
evolve the envelopes rather than the complete EM ﬁelds.
In fact, if suﬃcient care is taken with the approxima-
tions, and the system simulated is well behaved, even
quite wide-band pulses can be successfully modelled in
this way.

We can use an envelope approach with the G± vari-
ables. However, a full model requires four envelopes to
describe the G±, just as in a complete Maxwell theory
where envelopes are needed for both the backward and
forward travelling E and H. A full expansion of G± into
forward and backward envelopes G±

where we have suppressed the z argument on the enve-
lope functions for brevity. Note that the forward-like
G− contribution (i.e. G−
f ) needs a backward-travelling
carrier, as otherwise it is not possible to match the refer-
ence evolution terms for both G+
f . When inserted
into the wave equations, this expansion results in a large
number of terms, even for the relatively simple case of
a third-order nonlinearity. However, we can specialize
to the case where only forward-travelling waves are con-
sidered, and set G±
b = 0. Since the backward-travelling

f and G−

10

waves are now eliminated, we can propagate pulses eﬃ-
ciently in a moving frame. This is important, because
the backward parts in a moving frame move at twice the
frame speed. In a full (non-envelope) simulation, we need
somehow to ﬁlter out the backward components, as oth-
erwise the hoped-for numerical gains are lost by the fact
that a ﬁner z-step is required for accurate integration.

In a suitable narrow-band limit, we should be able to
ignore the ﬁrst term on the RHS of this equation, leaving
the evolution of the envelopes to be controlled solely by
the correction term. The description can be easily gen-
eralized to cases involving multiple components centred
on diﬀerent carrier frequencies. Note that this is a ﬁrst-
order envelope equation, and, as such, does not require
the various extra approximations needed when deriving
an envelope propagation equation from the standard (E
ﬁeld) second order wave equation.

VI. SECOND ORDER WAVE EQUATION

In section III we derived ﬁrst-order wave equations for
the ﬁeld variables ~G±. However, since many pulse prop-
agation theories start from a second-order form, we have
also derived a second-order propagation equation. We
apply the usual restriction to transverse-only ﬁelds, and
split the medium properties (i.e.
the permittivity and
permeability) into a reference part (with cr = 1/αrβr), a
linear dispersive part (controlled by αD
c ) and a non-
linear electro-optic polarization part ( ~P = αrαN L
~E).

erence is

This is similar to the usual second-order equation for
the electric ﬁeld, but has the addition of a curl operator

applied to the dispersion and polarization terms. This
second order wave equation can be solved with the use
of an envelope-carrier representation for ~G±, as is often
done with the standard equation for the electric ﬁeld E.
Such a derivation can be found in [16], which contains
both SVEA and GFEA [12] versions for both E and G±.
The most general form of eqn. (47) appears in [17].

VII. ALTERNATIVE DEFINITIONS

Just as one may decide to propagate the D ﬁeld instead
of the E ﬁeld, so directional ﬁeld variables in the style
of ~G± can be deﬁned in a number of ways. Continuing
with the pattern of combining transverse ﬁeld compo-
nents with a cross product, alternative directional ﬁelds
are

The ~G± or ~G′± variables will best suit problems de-
ﬁned in terms of ~E and ~H; the ~G± are best suited to
electric media, and the ~G′± to magnetic media. In con-
trast, the ~F ± or ~F ′± variables are more suited to ~D and
~B. All these deﬁnitions can be used to generate wave
equations, by a similar procedure to that in section III.
A point to note is that if the wave equations are general-
ized to include source terms, the ~G± and ~G′± forms (or
~F ± and ~F ′± forms) of the wave equations look somewhat
diﬀerent.

As an example, here are the full ﬁrst order wave equa-
tions for the ~F ±, F ◦ form, which is conceptually closest
to the UPPE (unidirectional pulse propagation equation)

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

We have introduced generalized forms of the direc-
tional ﬁeld variables ﬁrst envisaged by Fleck[1]]. We
have demonstrated that they are associated with en-
ergy ﬂuxes in the forward and backward directions.
They provide the ideal basis for the standard “forward-
only” pulse propagation model, both improving our in-
sight into pulse propagation, and allowing the backward-
propagating component to be eﬃciently discarded if de-
sired. By developing the theory in frequency space, we
have shown how the dispersive properties of the propa-
gation medium can be incorporated.

We have derived ﬁrst-order wave equations for ~G±
that are equivalent to Maxwell’s equations.
If disper-
sion is included carefully, the equations decouple and
we can get a single equation for forward-only propaga-
tion, and hence achieve signiﬁcant speed gains over di-
rect Maxwell’s equation solvers for E and H (such as
PSSD[5] or FDTD[6]). We have also presented a number
of simulations demonstrating their use.

Since the ~G± variables are not restricted to use in ﬁrst
order wave equations, we have also presented an envelope
theory and a second-order wave equation analogous to
those regularly used in pulse propagation work. Either
of these equations can be used to extend the practical
applications of ~G± variables into the long-pulse narrow-
band regimes. Further, ~G± can still be constructed from
the E and H ﬁeld obtained in traditional simulations,
enabling their use for either diagnosis or analysis.

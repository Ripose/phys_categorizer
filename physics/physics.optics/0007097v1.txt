1 Problem

Consider a classical model of matter in which spectral lines are associated with oscillators.
In particular, consider a gas with two closely spaced spectral lines, ω1,2 = ω0 ± ∆, where
∆ ≪ ω0. Each line has oscillator strength 1/Z, where Z is the atomic number of a gas atom,
and each has the same damping constant (and spectral width) γ. For simplicity, you may
suppose that ∆ = γ.

Ordinarily, the gas would exhibit strong absorption of light in the vicinity of the spectral
lines. But suppose that a laser of frequency ω2 “pumps” the second oscillator into an inverted
population. Classically, this is described by assigning a negative damping constant to this
oscillator: γ2 = −γ.
in this medium. Show also that frequencies very near ω0 propagate without attenuation.

Deduce an expression for the group velocity of a pulse of light centered on frequency ω0

In a recent experiment [1], the group velocity of light was reduced to 38 mph (17 m/s)
by this technique in a sodium vapor of density N = 5 × 1012 atoms/cm3 using a pair of lines
for which 2∆ ≈ 107/s.

2 Solution

In a medium of index of refraction n(ω), the dispersion relation can be written

k =

ωn
c

,

(1)

where k is the wave number and c is the speed of light. The group velocity is then given by

vg =

(2)

We next recall the classical oscillator model for the index of refraction. The index n is the
square root of the dielectric constant ǫ, which is in turn related to the atomic polarizability
α according to (in Gaussian units)

D = ǫE = E + 4πP = E(1 + 4πNα),

(3)

where D is the the electric displacement, E is the electric ﬁeld, P is the polarization density,
and N is the atomic number density. Then,

for a dilute gas with index near 1.

n = √ǫ ≈ 1 + 2πNα,

(4)

The polarizability α is obtained from the dipole moment p = ex = αE induced by electric
ﬁeld E. In the case of a single spectral line of frequency ω0, we say that the charge e is bound
to the (ﬁxed) nucleus by a spring of constant k = mω2
0, and the motion is subject to damping
−mγ ˙x. The equation of motion in the presence of a wave of frequency ω is

In the present problem, we have two spectral lines, ω1,2 = ω0 ± γ, both of oscillator
strength 1/Z, but the population of line 2 is inverted so that γ2 = −γ1 = −γ. In this case,
the polarizability is given by

lines pumped so as to produce a large rate of change of the index with nearby
frequency.

We now consider the issue of attenuation of a pulse of frequency ω. Since k = ωn/c ≈
ω(1 + 2πNα)/c, the spatial dependence eikz of a pulse propagating in the z direction includes

2

attenuation if the imaginary part of the index n is positive. However, the population inversion
described by γ2 = −γ1 leads to Im[α(ω0)] = 0. Hence, there is no attenuation of a probe
pulse at frequency ω0
In the present model, the pulse is attenuated at frequencies less than ω0, but grows (lases)
In the experiment of Hau et al. [1], lasing did not occur
at frequencies greater than ω0.
because line 2 actually corresponded to a transition between the upper level of line 1 and a
3rd, excited level. (In a sense, the quantum mechanical level structure with one high and two
low energy levels is the inverse of that assumed in the classical model here, i.e., one low and
two high levels.) Therefore, pumping at frequency ω2 did not produce an inverted population
that could lead to lasing; but it did lead to an eﬀective sign reversal of the damping constant
γ2 for a narrow range of frequencies near ω0. This classical argument presents a simpliﬁed
view of the quantum process called electormagnetically induced transparency [2].

To obtain the group velocity at frequency ω0, we need the derivative

Since α(ω0) = 0, we have n(ω0) = 1, and the phase velocity at ω0 is exactly c. The group

where r0 = e2/mc2 ≈ 3 × 10−13 cm is the classical electron radius. The group velocity is
lower in a denser medium.
In the experiment of Hau et al., the medium was sodium vapor (Z = 11), cooled to
less than a µK to increase the density. An additional increase in density by a factor of
5 was obtained when the vapor formed a Bose condensate. Plugging in the experimental
parameters, N = 5 × 1012/cm3 and γ = 5 × 106/s, we ﬁnd

vg ≈

Abstract: We derive a coupled mode theory for the interaction of an
optical cavity with a waveguide that includes waveguide dispersion. The
theory can be applied to photonic crystal cavity waveguide structures. We
derive an analytical solution to the add and drop spectra arising from such
interactions in the limit of linear dispersion. In this limit, the spectra can
accurately predict the cold cavity quality factor (Q) when the interaction is
weak. We numerically solve the coupled mode equations for the case of a
cavity interacting with the band edge of a periodic waveguide, where linear
dispersion is no longer a good approximation. In this regime, the density of
states can distort the add and drop spectra. This distortion can lead to more
than an order of magnitude overestimation of the cavity Q.

Introduction

High-Q photonic crystal (PC) resonators have recently become a subject of great interest. Such
cavities have important applications for low threshold lasers, high ﬁnesse ﬁlters, as well as
experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) [1, 2, 3]. One advantage of using PC
resonators is that they can be easily integrated with PC based waveguide structures. This is
important for integrated optical processing.

The interaction of a cavity resonator with a waveguide system has been theoretically studied
previously in [4]. That work considered waveguides with continuous translation symmetry and
ignored waveguide dispersion. Such approximations are often good for optical ﬁber waveg-
uides, but do not necessarily apply to PC based waveguides. These waveguides are periodic in
the direction of propagation, and hence exhibit discrete instead of continuous translation sym-
metry. Because of the discrete translation symmetry, the modes of the waveguide are no longer

simple travelling waves. Instead, they take on the form of Bloch states. Another consequence of
the waveguide periodicity is that it features an energy stop-band. At the edge of the stop band,
the group velocity goes to zero and the dispersion becomes important in characterizing the in-
teraction between the cavity and waveguide. The porperties of the interaction near the band
edge are particularly important when using photonic crystal cavities formed by single or mul-
tiple hole row defects. The modes of these type of cavities are primarily coupled to waveguide
modes near the band edge.

The main goal of this paper is to investigate the interaction of photonic crystal based cavities
and waveguides using coupled mode theory as in [4]. However, in order to apply coupled mode
theory, we must properly incorporate dispersion, which plays an important role in photonic
crystal waveguides. One of the main results of this paper is a set of coupled mode equations
that include dispersion and properly handle the Bloch mode structure of the waveguide modes.
Once this is derived, we can apply the theory to realistic photonic crystal based systems.

We ﬁrst derive the equations of motion for the coupled mode system. After deriving these
equations, we solve the system analytically for the special case where the waveguide dispersion
relation can be approximated by linear dispersion. Expressions for the add ﬁlter and drop ﬁlter
spectra are explicitly given. When the dispersion relation can no longer be approximated as
linear, as in the case of a periodic waveguide near the stop band, an analytical solution becomes
too difﬁcult to derive. Instead, we simulate the equations of motion numerically to ﬁnd the
solution.

Our simulations focus on the drop ﬁltering spectrum of the system. Drop ﬁltering is an impor-
tant operation to analyze because it is often used to measure the cavity quality factor (Q) [5].
To properly interpret such results, it is important to understand the limits under which these
measurements can be used to infer Q. We investigate two cases of waveguides that feature stop-
bands. The ﬁrst is a waveguide with weak periodicity in the direction of propagation. In this
limit the waveguide dispersion relation is parabolic. Although weak periodicity is rarely a good
approximation for photonic crystals, it provides a good toy model of a structure with a stop-
band, and elucidates much of the physical intuition about the problem. In the second case, we
apply the coupled mode theory to the realistic case of a row-defect photonic-crystal waveguide
coupled to a three-hole defect cavity. The modes of the cavity and waveguide, along with the
waveguide dispersion relation, are ﬁrst calculated using FDTD simulation. These simulations
are used to calculate the coupling coefﬁcients which enter into the coupled mode theory. The
system is then simulated, giving what we believe to be an accurate analysis of a real experi-
ment using such structures. In both cases, we show that when the cavity is resonant near the
stop-band, the cavity Q can be overestimated by more than an order of magnitude. This is be-
cause the interaction of the cavity with the waveguide is determined by both the cavity spectral
function, as well as the waveguide density of states. Near the band edge, the density of states
diverges leading to a sharp spectral feature that is unrelated to cavity properties.

2. Coupled Mode Theory

We begin the derivation of the coupled mode equations with the wave equation

where e (r) is the relative dielectric constant, and c is he speed of light in vacuum. We deﬁne e c
as the relative dielectric constant for the cavity, e w as the dielectric constant for the waveguide,
and e t for the coupled system. We assume the waveguide dielectric constant to be periodic.

Thus, the solutions to Eq. 1 with e = e w, denoted
Ew, must satisfy the Bloch theorem, and

hence take on the form

Bk are Bloch states that have the same periodicity as e w, k is the crystal momentum, and
where
z the direction of propagation in the waveguide. The cavity mode, which is the solution to Eq. 1
with e = e c as the index, is deﬁned as

A (r).

The dynamics of the coupled system are determined by setting e = e t in Eq. 1. Using the
standard arguments of coupled mode theory [6], we assume the solution of the coupled system
to take on the form

where a(t) is the slowly varying component of the cavity, and b(k,t) and c(k,t) are slowly vary-

the above solution back into Eq. 1, we derive the coupled mode equations

In the above equations, l
is a phenomenological decay constant which is added to account for
the ﬁnite lifetime of the cavity resulting from mechanisms other than cavity-waveguide cou-
pling. Pc and Pw(k) are external driving terms that can potentially drive the cavity or waveguide
at a frequency w p. The damping term h
is also included to give the waveguide modes a ﬁnite
lifetime. In the analytical calculations we take the limit h → 0. In the numerical simulations,
however, we set this damping term to a very small value in order to have a well deﬁned steady
state solution. The coupling constants are given by

3. Linear dispersion

The solution to the above set of coupled equations strongly depends on the waveguide disper-
sion relation, which relates w (k) to k. For some systems, we can assume that this relation is
linear, taking on the form

w (k) = w 0 + Vg(k − k0)
where Vg is the group velocity. When this linearized approximation is valid, an analytical so-
lution can be derived for Eq. 4-6. This solution is most easily obtained using the method of
Laplace transforms. We take the Lapace transform in time of Eq. 5 and Eq. 6 and plug into
Eq. 4. We make the additional approximation

The above expressions also assume that A(r) is a real function, so that g (k) = g (−k).

Consider ﬁrst the simple example of a ring-down experiment with no external sources, mean-
ing Pw = Pc = 0. The cavity is assumed to contain an initial ﬁeld a(0) at time 0. The solution of
the cavity ﬁeld is obtained from the equations of motion to be

a(t) = a(0)e−(l +G )t

(12)

The above solution has a simple interpretation. The constant l
is the rate at which the cavity
ﬁeld escapes into leaky modes, while G
is the rate at which the cavity ﬁeld escapes into the
waveguide. The total decay rate of the cavity ﬁeld is simply the sum of these two rates. It is
important to note that the coupling rate into the waveguide is inversely proportional to the group
velocity. This dependence is simply a reﬂection of the increased interaction time between the
cavity and waveguide at slower group velocities.

Next consider an add ﬁlter experiment, where both cavity and waveguide are initially empty
and Pw = 0. One can show that the cavity source term will drive the waveguide ﬁeld to a steady
state value given by

|bk(t)|2 =

The ﬁeld features the Lorentzian line-shape expected from an exponential decay process. Sim-
ilarly, one can derive the drop spectrum of the waveguide by setting Pc = 0. In this case the
waveguide spectrum is

4. Weakly periodic waveguides

In the linear dispersion limit there is little qualitative difference between the results presented
above and those for the single mode analysis in Ref. [4]. The main distinction is that with linear
dispersion, the interaction strength is inversely proportional to the group velocity. But in many
cases, one cannot linearly approximate the dispersion relation. One such case is a photonic
crystal waveguide, which is periodic in the direction of propagation and therefore features a
stop-band. At the edge of the stop-band, the group velocity goes to zero, at which point the
dispersive properties of the waveguide become important.

Fig. 1. Dispersion relation for a periodic waveguide.

Before treating the full case of photonic crystal structures, we start with a simpler case of
a waveguide with weak periodicity in the direction of propagation. The dispersion relation of
such a structure can be approximated as [6]

(15)

Above, L
is the periodicity of the lattice, D is the size of the bandgap (related to the index
contrast of the periodicity), and ne f f is an effective index of refraction. This dispersion relation
is plotted in Fig. 1.

To get an intuitive understanding of how a cavity will interact with a waveguide featuring
such a dispersion, we ﬁrst note that the cavity only couples well to waveguide modes which
conserve both energy and momentum. Because the cavity ﬁeld is conﬁned in both space and
energy, a cavity mode can be represented as a region in the dispersion diagram. In this work,
we consider cavities which are spatially localized to only a few wavelengths, but have quality
factors of hundreds or more. These cavities are highly localized in energy, and very delocalized
in momentum. We thus represent them as an elongated ellipse on the dispersion diagram. In
Figure 1 four different cavity resonant frequencies have been drawn. Cavities with resonant
frequencies of 0.7 and 0.8 lie in the nearly linear region of the dispersion diagram. This re-
gion can be treated analytically, as we have done above. The interaction between the cavity
and waveguide mode is primarily determined by energy conservation. If the waveguide is ini-
tially excited, modes which are near the cavity resonance will preferentially be scattered. The
transmitted spectrum can then be used to infer the cavity spectrum, as Eq. 14 indicates.

Next, consider the cavity with a resonant frequency of 0.9, which is right at the band edge
of the waveguide. In this case, the interaction with the waveguide is not simply determined by
energy conservation. The cavity scatters more strongly in regions with higher density of states,
leading to distortion of the line shape. In this case, the transmission spectrum of the waveguide
is no longer a good representation of the cavity spectrum, and may lead to false prediction of
the cavity Q. We verify this by numerically simulating Eq. 4-6 using the dispersion relation in
Eq. 15.

In the simulation, the speed of light is set to c = 1, and the effective index of refraction is
ne f f = 1. The bandgap constant is set to D = 0.1. We set k ab = k ba = 10−2, and assume that
these coupling constants are independent of k. This is a good approximation for small cavities

which are highly delocalized in momentum. The cavity decay constant is set to 0.01, which
corresponds to a cavity Q of 35 for w c = 0.7. This value was selected because it corresponds to
a sufﬁciently narrow linewidth for the simulation, but is not exceedingly narrow that it requires
very long simulation times. To simulate drop ﬁltering we set both waveguide and cavity to be
initially empty, and pump the waveguide modes with a pump source whose resonant frequency
w p is swept across the cavity resonance. We set the waveguide modes to have a decay constant
h = 0.0005, which is much smaller than the decay of the cavity, and pump the system until a
steady-state value is reached. We then calculate the transmitted power which is deﬁned as

(cid:12)
where t f is a large enough time for all transients to decay so that the system is in steady state.
(cid:12)
The transmitted power is normalized by the transmitted power of the waveguide without a
cavity. This normalization constant is calculated by evolving the system with k ab = k ba = 0.

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

The transmission as a function of pump frequency is shown in Figure 2. The transmission is
plotted for a cavity resonant frequency of 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 0.92. The cavities with resonant fre-
quencies of 0.7 and 0.8 are in the linear dispersion regime, so their drop spectrum is lorentzian
as predicted by Eq. 14. The linewidth of the drop spectrum for these two frequencies has a
width which corresponds to a decay rate of 0.01, and is therefore completely determined by the
cavity lifetime. However, as the cavity resonance approaches the stop-band, as for w 0 = 0.9,
the cavity spectrum signiﬁcantly narrows. This linewidth distortion is caused by the divergence
of the density of states near the band edge. The linewidth when w 0 = 0.9 corresponds to a qual-
ity factor of 180, which is signiﬁcantly larger than the cold cavity Q of 45. The effect is even
more dramatic when w 0 = 0.92, at which point the cavity resonance is completely inside the
bandgap. Despite the fact that the cavity does not resonate with any of the waveguide modes,
the extremely high density of states near the band edge still allows the cavity to efﬁciently scat-
ter light. This results in an extremely sharp resonance right at the band edge frequency, whose
linewidth corresponds to a Q of 1800.

5. Photonic crystal cavity-waveguide system

We now consider the more realistic case of a photonic crystal cavity-waveguide system. Fig-
ure 3 shows an SEM image of the type of system to be analyzed. A waveguide is formed from a

row defect in a hexagonal photonic crystal lattice with a periodicity a, slab thickness d = 0.65a,
hole radius r = 0.3a, and refractive index n = 3.6. The waveguide is evanescently coupled to a
cavity formed by a three hole defect. Figure 4 shows three dimensional (3D) FDTD simulations
of the cavity mode, which has a normalized resonant frequency of 0.251 in units of a/l
, where
l
is the free space wavelength. Figure 5 shows the dispersion relation of the waveguide modes,
which are calculated by the same 3D FDTD method. The stars represent the modes of the
hexagonal photonic crystal lattice. The bandgap of the lattice lies between the frequencies 0.23
and 0.33, where no propagating modes exist. Waveguiding can only happen in this bandgap
region. The circles represent the modes of the waveguide. Inside the bandgap these modes lie
in two waveguide bands. The insets show the z component of the magnetic ﬁeld of these two
bands at the band edge, taken at the center of the slab. One of the modes has even parity across
the center of the waveguide, while the other mode has odd parity. Looking at Figure 4, one can
see that the cavity mode has even parity, and will therefore couple only to the even parity Bloch
state. Thus, the odd parity mode can be neglected in the simulations. It is important to note that
both the even and odd modes feature a nearly ﬂat dispersion near the band edge.

Next, we calculate the coupling coefﬁcients k ab and k ba using FDTD simulations as well as

equations 7 and 8. The results are shown in Figure 6. The cavity is most strongly coupled to
waveguide modes near k = p /a, which is the ﬂattest region of the dispersion. The calculated
coupling constants are used to simulate the waveguide transmission using the same technique
as the weak periodicity waveguide. A three hole defect cavity of the type shown in Fig. 3 has
a typical Q of about 2000. Such a high quality factor would require extremely long calculation
times to properly simulate. Instead, we set the cavity Q 350. The drop spectrum of the cavity
is plotted in Figure 5. From the full-width half-max bandwidth of the cavity one ﬁnds a Q of
1300, which is much larger than the cold cavity Q. The width of the transmission spectrum in
Fig. 7 is limited by the spectral resolution of the simulation.

In conclusion, we presented a coupled mode theory for cavity-waveguide interaction which
includes waveguide dispersion. In the limit of linearly dispersion, we derived an analytical
solution for the cavity decay rate, as well as the add and drop spectra. In this regime, the
decay rate into the waveguide is found to be inversely proportional to the group velocity. The
add and drop spectra are also found to accurately predict the cavity spectrum in the limit of
weak interaction. For the case of nonlinear dispersion, we have numerically solved for the
transmission spectrum of the waveguide coupled to the cavity. We investigated waveguides that

velocity vanishes. The diverging density of states near the band edge can lead to more than
an order of magnitude overestimation of the cavity Q. We believe these results are important
in order to better understand general cavity-waveguide interactions in most photonic crystal
systems.

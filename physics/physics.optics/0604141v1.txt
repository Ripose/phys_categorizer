Abstract The total scattering and the extinction efﬁciencies of a
nihility cylinder of inﬁnite length and circular cross–section are
identical and independent of the polarization state of a normally
incident plane wave.

Keywords Extinction efﬁciency, Negative refraction, Nihility,
Scattering efﬁciency

1. Introduction

The emergence of nihility as an electromagnetic medium
[1] can be attributed to the rather extraordinary devel-
opments on negatively refracting materials during this
decade [2, 3]. Much of the impetus for this development
has been provided by the prospect of the so–called perfect
lens [4]. Any perfect lens in the present context is required
to simulate nihility [5, 6].

The relative permittivity and the relative permeability of
nihility are null–valued. Clearly, nihility is unachievable,
but it may be approximately simulated in some narrow fre-
quency range — hence, its attraction [7, 8]. Reﬂection and
refraction of plane waves due to nihility half–spaces [8]
and slabs [5, 6] has been studied in some detail, as well as
the scattering of plane waves by nihility spheres [9]. Along
the same lines, this communication focuses on the canon-
ical problem [10, 11] of the scattering response of a ni-
hility cylinder of circular cross–section and inﬁnite length
to a normally incident plane wave. An exp(
iωt) time–
dependence is implicit in the following sections.

2. Boundary Value Problem

≤

The geometry of the canonical problem is best stated us-
ing the cylindrical coordinate system (ρ, φ, z). The cylin-
a is oriented parallel to the z axis; and, with its
der ρ
wave vector parallel to the
x axis, a plane wave is nor-
−
mally incident on this cylinder. Two different cases must
be considered: (i) The incident magnetic ﬁeld phasor is
parallel to the z axis, (ii) the incident electric ﬁeld phasor
is parallel to the z axis.

Direct derivation for a nihility cylinder being evidently
intractable, a limiting procedure has to be resorted to.
Therefore, let the relative permittivity of the cylinder be

The incident ﬁeld exists everywhere in the region of in-
terest when the scatterer is absent. Therefore, the incident
electric and magnetic ﬁeld phasors may be stated as fol-

2.3 Limiting Procedure for Nihility Cylinder

Now, the refractive index of nihility must be null–valued
because ǫr = µr = 0. For the functions Ln(ξ), we have

3. Discussion

The equality of extinction and total scattering efﬁciencies
for either case is an afﬁrmation of the nondissipative na-
ture of nihility. The equality of efﬁciencies for both cases

An remarkable consequence of (22) is that the extinc-
tion and the total scattering efﬁciencies of a nihility cylin-
der do not change with the polarization state of the inci-
dent plane wave. In other words, if the incident plane wave
is arbitrarily polarized such that

the total scattering and the extinction efﬁciencies are in-
dependent of the ratio Az/Ay. The extinction efﬁciency
is shown in Figure 1 as a function of the normalized size
parameter k0a.

Furthermore, on examining the scattering function

The equality of scattering coefﬁcients for cases (i) and

impedance–matched to free space (i.e., ηr = 1). Indeed,

exercise in Section 2 for obliquely incident plane waves

preted after the limiting procedure was implemented.

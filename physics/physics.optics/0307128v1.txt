Abstract

Intermodal interactions displayed through the phenomena of mode coupling and conversion in

optical systems are treated by means of the Lindstedt-Poincar´e perturbation method of strained

parameters more widely known in classical quantum mechanics and quantum chemistry as the sta-

tionary perturbation technique. The focus here is on the mode conversion at the points of virtual

phase matching (otherwise called anticrossings or avoided crossings) associated with the maximum

conversion eﬃciency. The method is shown to provide a convenient tool to deal with intermodal

interactions at anticrossings — interactions induced by any kind of perturbation in dielectric index

proﬁle of the waveguide, embracing optical inhomogeneity, magnetization of arbitrary orientation,

and nonlinearity. Closed-form analytic expressions are derived for the minimum value of mode

mismatch and for the length of complete mode conversion (the coupling length, or the beat length)

in generic waveguiding systems exhibiting anticrossings. Demonstrating the eﬀectiveness of the

method, these general expressions are further applied to the case of TEn

TMm mode conversion

in (i) a multilayer gyrotropic waveguide under piecewise-constant, arbitrarily oriented magneti-

zation, and (ii) an optically-inhomogeneous planar dielectric waveguide — an example which the

standard coupled-mode theory fails to describe.

INTRODUCTION

Mode coupling and conversion are commonly known and primarily important phenomena

in ﬁber and integrated optics, either hindering or fueling the operation of numerous devices

and elements, e.g., electro-optical and acousto-optical switches and modulators, waveguide

couples, power splitters, wavelength ﬁlters, and others (see, e.g., Refs. 1, 2, 3, and references

therein). When a mode of certain conﬁguration transverses the structure and converts into

some other mode, say, due to the externally induced perturbation in optical properties or

geometrical conﬁguration of the structure or due to the imperfectness of the materials used,

or when the exchange of energy between the guided modes of adjacent waveguides occurs —

anyway we face the phenomena of mode coupling and conversion. The crucial regime for the

mode coupling is in the vicinity of the points of virtual phase matching (otherwise referred

to as “anticrossings” or “avoided crossings” — a terminology brought about from quantum

mechanics and solid-state physics). At anticrossings, the complete mode conversion can be

achieved, which makes tailoring this regime particularly important for the applications. For

a positive example, let me mention a promising method for controllable dispersion com-

pensation in photonic bandgap ﬁbers based on weak interactions at anticrossings between

the core-guided mode and a mode localized in an intentionally introduced defect of the

crystal [4]. An opposing example of technology strains due to the undesirable intermodal

interactions is radiation losses caused by the coupling of the guided mode to radiation modes

in a two-dimensional photonic crystal etched into a planar waveguide (see, e.g., Ref. 5).

A dominating theoretical tool for the whole of mode coupling and conversion phenom-

ena (except a few cases when rigorous analytical treatment is possible — see Refs. 6, 7) is

the coupled-mode, or the coupled-wave, formalism [1, 2, 3, 8] that was ﬁrst proposed more

than ﬁfty years ago and since then became commonplace in both optical engineering re-

search and textbook literature. The mathematical foundation of all the modiﬁcations of the

coupled-mode formalism is the method of variation of independent coeﬃcients — one of the

fruitful methods in perturbation theory [9]. Nevertheless, the formalism grounds upon the

diﬀering amount of approximations — e.g., that of slowly-varying dielectric function ǫǫ(r),
so that the electric ﬁeld E(r) is assumed to satisfy ∇(∇

E) = 0; the so-called parabolic

·

approximation; and others — which certainly limits the usefulness of the model. Moreover,

the resultant “coupled modes” often fail to satisfy orthogonality relations and boundary

2

conditions in the actual (perturbed) structure. Finally, the coupled-mode formalism ignores

all of the explicit mathematical parallels to the classical quantum-mechanics problems that

also exploit perturbation techniques, in particular the widely known perturbation method

for stationary levels [10, 11] — a modiﬁcation of the Lindstedt-Poincar´e method of strained

parameters sometimes called the Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger method (see Refs. 9, 10 for the bib-

liographical details). Meanwhile, establishing and tracking the analogies between classical

quantum mechanics and optics tends to be a really stimulating approach — both through

adopting the formalism of electromagnetic-wave propagation in dielectric materials to col-

lisionless propagation of eﬀective-mass electron waves in semiconductor crystals [12, 13],

and on the other hand through applying the formalism of quantum-mechanical solid-state

electronics to electromagnetic propagation in periodic dielectric structures which proved to

be a very successful programme during the last decade [14, 15, 16].

In this article, I translate the classical stationary perturbation technique — i.e., the

method of strained parameters — to the case of mode coupling and conversion in optical

waveguiding systems. The problem of source-free light propagation is formulated in Sec. II

as an ordinary eigenvalue problem in the squared free-space wavenumber κ

k2 = ω2/c2

≡

(or, actually, in the angular frequency ω) for the magnetic ﬁeld H(r), and perturbations in

dielectric index proﬁle of the waveguide are considered, embracing the cases of optical in-

homogeneity, magnetization of arbitrary orientation, and nonlinearity. Both the eigenvalues

and the eigenvectors are expanded into a series in perturbation parameter, giving rise to

an electromagnetic counterpart of the quantum-mechanics stationary perturbation method

as an alternative to the coupled-mode formalism. Although physical interpretation of the

former in the case of nondegenerate spectrum of eigenvalues looks rather questionable from

the point of experiment, the method however provides promptly solvable and naturally in-

terpretable treatment of the modal behavior at the anticrossings, which is an issue in the

mode conversion analysis. To demonstrate the eﬃciency of the method, I refer in Sec. III

to the two practice-targeted examples from integrated optics concerning TE

TM mode

↔

coupling: a multilayer gyrotropic waveguide subject to constant, arbitrarily oriented mag-

netic ﬁeld, and an optically-inhomogeneous planar dielectric waveguide — an example which

falls out of the scope of the standard coulped-mode theory. The unperturbed basis for the

both cases is a multilayer waveguide composed of linear isotropic dielectric materials — a

simple structure known to exhibit under certain circumstances the perfect phase matching

3

of guided TE and TM modes [17], thus it is natural to implement here the developed theory

for the mode conversion at anticrossings. For both systems, I pursue the formulated way to

derive closed-form ﬁrst-order analytic expressions for the minimum value of mode mismatch

and hence for the length of complete TEn

TMm mode conversion (the coupling length,

↔
or the beat length). Finally, I conclude in Sec. IV with some claims concerning further pos-

sible applications and modiﬁcations of the stationary perturbation technique for the optical

waveguiding theory.

II. H-EIGENPROBLEM AND ANTICROSSINGS

A. H-eigenproblem

Let me start with the wave equation for the magnetic ﬁeld

where ǫ = ǫ(r) is the dielectric permittivity distribution, κ

k2 = ω2/c2 the squared free-

space wave number, ω the angular frequency, c the vacuum speed of light, and the ﬁeld H

but there are two sound reasons to restrict oneself to the H-eigenproblem (1), but not to

its E-counterpart (4): ﬁrst, an accompanying to Eq. (1) divergence equation (2) is clearly
simpler than ∇

(ǫE) = 0 — a satellite equation for the E-eigenproblem; second, given the

·

dielectric index a real scalar function of coordinates — i.e., a real scalar ﬁeld — or, more

generally, a Hermitian dyadic ﬁeld, the Maxwellian (3) becomes Hermitian too [18] — the

fact that is though not crucial in macroscopic electrodynamics (non-Hermitian Maxwellian

4

would generete a set of nonorthogonal eigenmodes and complex-valued eigenfrequencies — a

situation normally faced in optics of lossy qyrotropic media [19]) nor pertinent to the present

treatment, but aesthetically pleasant and legitimates many of the cross-references between

Eq. (1) and the stationary Schr¨odinger eigenproblem with Hermitian Hamiltonian as well.

For a large class of waveguiding systems, namely, for those exhibiting continuous transla-

tion symmetry along the direction of light propagation (say, the z direction) we can assign

harmonic dependence of the ﬁelds on that direction; in particular, the magnetic ﬁeld reads

H(r; β) = eiβzH(x, y),

(5)

where β is the propagation constant, so that for a given z-independent dielectric index proﬁle
ǫ(0)(x, y) Eq. (1) reduces to an eigenvalue problem for H(x, y); the reduced eigenproblem

operator depends parametrically on β then and at a ﬁxed β spawns a set of eigenvalues

κ(β), thus yielding dispersion structure

(κ, β) = 0 of a perfect waveguide. If an actual

D

dielectric permittivity distribution ǫ(r) of the waveguide happens to diﬀer from ǫ(0)(x, y) for

which Eq. (5) holds, that is ǫ(r) = ǫ(0)(x, y) + εδǫ(r) (we do not need to specify at this stage

whether δǫ(r) is a scalar or a tensor ﬁeld) and

ǫ−1(r) = ξ(0)(x, y) + εξ(1)(r) + ε2ξ(2)(r) + . . . ,

where ξ(i)(r) = [

δǫ(r)]i/[ǫ(0)(x, y)]i+1, i = 0, 1, . . ., then in the spirit of the Lindstedt-

−

Poincar´e perturbation method of strained parameters [9, ch. 3] one can rewrite Eq. (1)

as

problem (11) is assumed to be known; to say more — and this is an important point —
I further assume all the H(0)

the cases of practical interest. The subsequent steps of the method depend essentially on

whether the spectrum of

I explicitly designated the (parametric) dependence of all the quantities in Eqs. (13),

the form as per Eq. (5). Now, the restriction β = ﬁxed for the set of nondegenerate modes

one might consider Eq. (1) as a generalized eigenproblem in, e.g., β or ˜β, parametrically

dependent on κ, which would lead to expansions like (13) but into the

set. Of

course, this severely complicates the formalism — and probably here is an issue why the

coupled-mode theory has been exclusively dominating for decades in the ﬁeld. Fortunately,

the case of quasi-degenerate eigenvalues allows promptly solvable and easily interpretable

treatment in terms of the ordinary H-eigenproblem in κ.

In quantum mechanics, this situation corresponds to quasi-degenerate energy levels of a

quantum system and is associated with enormous variety of eﬀects and treatments — take

the Landau-Zener model for example [20], nourishing nearly 100 publications a year.

In

the realm of optics, Eq. (16) with coeﬃcients given by Eqs. (17), (18) is fully consistent

with the general statement that complete mode conversion can be achieved in any system
exhibiting anticrossings. Indeed, instead of the H(0)
another on the dispersion structure diagram (Fig. 1), at the anticrossings the H(0)
“transforms” continuously into the H(0)

1 mode
2 one, and vice-versa, over a certain frequency range,

1 mode and the H(0)

2 mode crossing one

1 and H(0)

so it is intuitive to expect that somewhere in the vicinity of the virtual crossing point the
H(0)
2 modes would be equally unsuitable to play the role of the fundamental modes
H+ and H−, and if the original (input) wave is H(0)
2 , it wouldn’t “feel” which of the
fundamental modes, H+ or H−, is more suited for it, and thus would oscillate between H(0)
1
and H(0)

2 . Mathematically, these heuristic speculations are expressed via the requirement

under condition (21) that the quantity

where k0 = ω0/c, ω0 is the frequency of a virtual mode crossing (phase matching), reaches
M12M21, thus the minimum eigenmode mismatch ∆kmin along

its minimum value of 2ε√

speciﬁc systems relevant to integrated optics: for a multilayer gyrotropic stack and for an

(that is, when both φs(x) and ψp(x) are either even or odd); on the contrary, the modes

of opposite symmetry in φs(x) and ψp(x) are virtually not sensitive to the longitudinal

magnetization (u = uzˆz). Asymmetric sandwiching impairs this behavior.

2. The integral (38) contains scaling parameter β−1 that deﬁnes characteristic thickness

of the waveguide corresponding to the comparable values of the both integrals, Eqs. (37) and

(38), in Eq. (36), and hence to the comparable shares of polar and longitudinal polarizations

in the mode conversion eﬃciency. For optical frequencies β−1

the waveguide considerably exceeds β−1, than ψp(x)would appear to be a too slowly varying

B. Optically-inhomogeneous dielectric waveguide

If we assume ξ = ξ(r) in Eq. (26) to be a scalar function within the waveguide volume

V , which conveys the cases of optical inhomogeneity and “isotropic” nonlinearity, then it is

advantageous to simplify Eq. (26) using the identity

H = 0 is taken into account. In planar geometry, we are concerned as before with

the TE and TM modes, but now expressed exclusively through the magnetic ﬁeld vectors.

For the TM (p-polarized) mode we can readily apply Eq. (35); for the TE (s-polarized) mode

we have for the electric ﬁeld, in parallel with Eq. (34),

Es = eiβzϕs(x)ˆy,

where we once again encounter β (in fact, β−1) in the role of scaling parameter. If we put,

say, H = Hs in Eq. (41) and multiply the result by H ∗

p , then only the ﬁrst and second terms

of the sum (41) will produce nonzero results, as it immediately follows from Eqs. (43) and

(35). Equation (26) thus gives

Now care should be taken when dealing with ∇ξ function which is discontinuous in the
vicinity of material boundaries [otherwise — if ∇ξ is assumed to be all-continuous — Eq. (44)
sp = 0]. The safest way is to introduce a new vector ﬁeld ς = ς(r) instead of ∇ξ,

We see that for the nonzero mode conversion, the ξ(r) function should exhibit explicit

dependence on the y coordinate. Another important consequence relates the eﬀect of the z-

modulation of ξ(r) on the coupling length. If ξ(r) does not depend on z, then we can write

On the contrary, if ξ(r) is a stochastically oscillating or periodic function of z, Eq. (49)

markedly modiﬁes. Say, for the ξ(z)

cos(z/Z) dependence we have

∝

∝

sin(z/Z)

which is of the order of unity and dramatically drops to zero if the period Z is of an order

of or less than the current experimental precision.

Finally, I would like to remind here that conventional expression for the oﬀ-diagonal

coupling matrix element given by the standard coupled-mode theory [1, 2, 3, 8],

gives an identical zero for the TE

IV. CONCLUSION

Mode conversion displays breaking the (initial) symmetry of the Hamiltonian of a system

by some perturbation that distorts the mode spectrum, i.e., shifts the eigenvalues and alters

polarization of the eigenmodes, hence a natural tool to treat the mode coupling and conver-

sion phenomena is the perturbation technique. For the mode conversion at anticrossings, I

presented in this article an electromagnetic counterpart of quantum-mechanical perturba-

tion theory for quasi-degenerate levels based on the Lindstedt-Poincar´e method of strained

parameters as a speciﬁc alternative to the entrenched coupled-mode formalism grounded

upon the method of variation of independent coeﬃcients.

The general expressions derived for the minimum mode mismatch at anticrossings,

Eq. (24), and for the coupling length, Eq. (25), are compact, transparent and premise on the

calculation of just one element of the coupling matrix, Eq. (26). That matrix element was

calculated explicitly for the two cases of interest in integrated optics: for a multilayer gy-

rotropic waveguide under piecewise-constant, arbitrarily oriented magnetization [Eq. (29)],

and for an optically-inhomogeneous planar dielectric waveguide [Eq. (44)]. In a similar way

a large variety of optical systems can be analyzed, including Bragg’s ﬁbers, photonic crystals

with broken periodicity, etc.

14

Finally, I should note that by means of an appropriate coordinate mapping, the problem

of perturbation due to shifted material boundaries — so to say, geometrical perturbation

known to spur diﬃculties when treated via conventional perturbation techniques [23] — can

be reduced to the problem of perturbation in permittivity and permeability proﬁles of a

waveguide exhibiting the perfect geometry in those (curvilinear) coordinates and governed

by the “Cartesian-like” Maxwell’s equations. Such a trick that recently aided the FDTD

modeling of high index-contrast photonic crystals [24, 25, 26, 27] would also signiﬁcantly

augment both the standard coupled-mode theory and the stationary perturbation technique

described here.

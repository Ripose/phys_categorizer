We analyze nonlinear guided waves in a planar waveguide made of a left-handed material sur-
rounded by a Kerr-like nonlinear dielectric. We predict that such a waveguide can support fast and
slow symmetric and antisymmetric nonlinear modes. We study the symmetry breaking bifurcation
and asymmetric modes in such a symmetric structure. We analyze nonlinear dispersion properties
of the guided waves, and show that the modes can be both forward and backward.

Experimental realization of composite structures with
simultaneously negative dielectric permittivity and neg-
ative magnetic permeability [1] revived the theoretical
interest to the left-handed materials (LHMs). Such ma-
terials were ﬁrst considered theoretically by Veselago [2],
who predicted negative refraction at the interface be-
tween LHM and conventional dielectric, inverse Doppler
and inverse Vavilov-Cherenkov eﬀects. Although LHMs
do not exist in nature, artiﬁcial metallic composites [1]
can eﬀectively be described as materials having both di-
electric permittivity and magnetic permeability negative
in the microwave frequency range. Nowadays, the eﬀorts
have been made to design LHMs for optical frequencies
using metallic nanowires [3]. Additionally, it was shown
that photonic crystals demonstrate negative refraction
under some conditions [4, 5], thus resembling the most
famous feature of LHMs.

In 1960’s Veselago predicted that a slab of LHM with
some particular parameters surrounded by usual dielec-
tric can focus light emitted by a point source located at
one side of the slab to the point image on the other side of
the slab [2]. Later, Pendry suggested [6] that such a lens
can focus not only propagating waves, but also evanes-
cent waves, thus creating a perfect image of the source.
Although, hot debates on the possibility to create such
a perfect lens followed this suggestion (see, e.g.
[7]), it
is clear that the planar structures containing LHMs have
a high potential for the future image processing appli-
cations.
In particular, it was already shown, that the
periodic structure of alternating layers of negative refrac-
tion material and dielectric possesses an unusual band-
gap structure [8, 9], when the average refractive index on
the structural period is equal to zero, and it can be used
for the complex beam shaping [9].

Recent studies of the waveguiding by the structures
with LHMs have shown that the properties of guided
modes in such systems diﬀer essentially from those of
conventional waveguides. So far, linear waves guided by
an interface and by a slab of LHM (see, e.g. [10, 11]) as
well as nonlinear surface waves [12] have been studied. It
has been shown that the mode structure and frequency
dispersion may have an unconventional form and unex-
pected properties.

The study of linear waves of a LH slab waveguide [11]

has shown some of their peculiar properties, such as the
absence of the fundamental mode, mode double degen-
eracy, and the existence of both forward and backward
waves. In this paper, we study nonlinear guided modes in
a waveguide formed by a slab of linear LHM embedded
into nonlinear dielectric, and we show that symmetric,
antisymmetric and asymmetric waves are supported by
such a waveguide, and we study their properties. We
predict, that in nonlinear regime additional modes which
do not exist in linear problem appear. We demonstrate
that the propagation of the wavefronts (characterized by
the phase velocity) with respect to the direction of the
energy ﬂow (Poynting vector) depends on the propaga-
tion constant, and the waves can be both forward and
backward travelling.

To study nonlinear guided waves in a nonlinear waveg-
uide, we consider a LH slab with real negative dielectric
permittivity ǫ2 and real negative magnetic permeability
µ2 surrounded by a nonlinear dielectric [see inset in Fig.
1(a)] with constant magnetic permeability µ1 and dielec-
tric permittivity ǫ1 depending on the intensity of the elec-
tric ﬁeld

At this point, we separate the guided waves into fast

larger than the phase velocity of light in a homogeneous
medium of the core. For such modes, γ2 < ǫ2µ2, and
their localization is caused by the total internal reﬂec-
tion of light from the cladding, resembling localization
of waves in a dielectric waveguide. For the slow modes,

or solitons which are centered at x = x1 and x = x2 at
either side of the slab. The modes with x1 <
L and
x2 > L have the ﬁeld maxima at the corresponding side
of the waveguide. From the linear theory, it follows that
solutions for the stationary modes can be found sepa-
rately for the symmetric and antisymmetric modes. As
has already been shown [13], even in a symmetric non-
linear dielectric waveguide asymmetric modes can exist.
To ﬁnd the asymmetric waves general solution (5) of the
diﬀerential equation (4) should be considered here. Equa-
tions for the parameters x1, x2 of the guided modes can
be found from the boundary conditions by eliminating
the constants A and B,

Note, that the energy ﬂow in the mode can be both pos-
itive and negative with respect to the wavevector, since
inside the slab the energy propagates in the opposite di-
rection to that outside the slab, and the total energy ﬂow
depends on a ratio of these quantities.

Dependence of the normalized energy ﬂow p on the di-
mensionless wave number γ for both fast and slow modes
is shown in Fig. 1. Parameters in the ﬁgure are chosen
in such a way that only one fast mode with a single node
(close to the point 4) exists in the linear case (at low in-
tensities; for the solution of linear problem and for the
choice of parameters see, e.g. Ref. [11]). Thin solid curve
shows the power of two solitons in a homogeneous nonlin-
ear cladding versus the propagation number. The mode
structures are shown in Fig. 2, where each plot demon-
strates the transverse wave proﬁle corresponding to the
numbered point in Fig. 1.

The modes with the parameters close to the dotted
curve (points 1, 5, 8 in Fig. 1) resembles two in-phase
and out-of-phase solitons at either side of the waveguide.
Closer to the dotted curve the soliton centers in the non-
linear media move further away from the waveguide. The
symmetry breaking bifurcation appears on the symmet-
ric mode branch. The asymmetric mode dispersion curve
in the fast region ends in the symmetric mode branch [see
Fig. 1 (a)], while in the slow wave region the asymmet-
ric mode disappears, when the amplitude of the wave at
one interface becomes the same as the amplitude of the
soliton on the other side of the waveguide. Two struc-
tures (points 6,7 in Fig. 2) obtained at the same value
of the propagation constant show the point of the sym-
metry breaking, where a slight asymmetry can be seen
in the mode structure shown in the example 7 in Fig. 2.
Symmetric and asymmetric modes can be both forward
and backward travelling (p > 0 and p < 0, respectively).
For the parameters indicated in Fig. 1, only one fast
guided mode with a single node exists in the linear limit,
while in the nonlinear regime the modes with zero, one
and two nodes appear (see Fig. 2). With increasing the
waveguide thickness, one more symmetry breaking point
appears on the antisymmetric mode branch, when the
slab parameter L exceeds some threshold value. More-
over, more high-order modes can be supported by the
structure, and the nonlinear dispersion diagram becomes
more complicated.

Nonlinear dispersion shown in Fig. 3(a) is obtained for
the parameters when two slow modes exist in the linear
case (at low intensities). The transverse structure of the
modes, corresponding to the numbered points in Fig. 3(a)
is shown in Fig. 3(b). For symmetric and antisymmetric
modes dispersion curves start from zero energy points
corresponding to linear modes in the slow-wave region
of the plot, and they end at the curve representing the
power of two solitons when the modes have the structure
of two in-phase or out-of-phase solitons shifted from the
waveguide at either side of it. Nonlinearity can only re-
duce the propagation constant of these modes (bold solid
and dotted lines), thus increasing the wave phase veloc-

4

ity. These symmetric and antisymmetric modes become
fast with the growth of the intensity. This becomes possi-
ble due to the nonlinear change of the index of refraction
proﬁle in the waveguide cladding. This index modiﬁca-
tion is caused by a high ﬁeld amplitude in the part of the
cladding next to the core, as one can see from the plots
(1,3,4,6) in Fig. 3.

The symmetry breaking bifurcation point is located
at the symmetric mode branch. The asymmetric mode
branch ends at the curve corresponding to the power of
one-soliton, when the mode is represented by a soliton
inﬁnitely shifted from the waveguide from one side of it
and a vanishingly small ﬁeld trapped inside the waveg-
uide (point 9 in Fig. 3). Plots (4,5) in Figs. 3(b) shows
the symmetric and asymmetric modes structure for the
same value of the propagation constant at the point of
the symmetry breaking.

The two presented dispersion characteristics of the
nonlinear waves in a LH waveguide surrounded by a Kerr-
like nonlinear medium show the general dispersion prop-

erties of the low-order fast and slow modes, which are
qualitatively similar in other parameter regions.

In conclusion, we have studied nonlinear guided waves
in a waveguide structure created by a slab of linear LH
material surrounded by a nonlinear conventional dielec-
tric. We have shown that fast and slow symmetric, asym-
metric and antisymmetric modes can exist in this sys-
tem. On the dispersion diagram, the symmetry break-
ing occurs for both symmetric and antisymmetric mode
branches. In the latter case, there exists a threshold value
of the slab thickness above which the asymmetric modes
appear. The guided waves can be both forward and back-
ward travelling. While the direction of the energy ﬂow is
determined by a source, the type of the wave determines
the phase velocity direction, i.e. the phase front propa-
gates from the source in the forward waves, and to the
source, in the backward waves.

Spatial solitons in nonlinear left-handed metamaterials

We predict that nonlinear left-handed metamaterials can support both TE- and TM-polarized self-
trapped localized beams, spatial electromagnetic solitons. Such solitons appear as single- and multi-
hump beams, being either symmetric or antisymmetric, and they can exist due to the hysteresis-type
magnetic nonlinearity and the eﬀective domains of negative magnetic permeability.

PACS numbers: 78.20.Ci, 41.20.Jb, 42.81.Dp

Left-handed metamaterials, i.e. materials with simul-
taneously negative real parts of dielectric permittivity
and magnetic permeability [1], demonstrate many pe-
culiar properties including negative refraction and sub-
wavelength imaging. A number of recent experiments
reported the observation of some of those properties
for artiﬁcially fabricated composites [2, 3] and planar
transmission-line structures [4] at microwave frequencies.
There are strong eﬀorts to fabricate the left-handed com-
posite materials operating at other frequencies, and neg-
ative magnetic permeability at THz frequencies has been
recently demonstrated in planar structures composed of
nonmagnetic conductive resonant elements [5].

Composite materials used for demonstrating the prop-
erties of left-handed media and negative refraction pos-
sess combined negative electric and magnetic response in
some ﬁnite frequency range determined by the resonant
properties of nonmagnetic conductive elements of the ar-
tiﬁcial composites. Nonlinearity introduced in such ma-
terials would allow to control the frequency domain with
the left-handed properties through strong modiﬁcation
of the eﬀective nonlinear magnetic response [6]. In par-
ticular, both dielectric permittivity and magnetic perme-
ability of the composite material consisting of a mesh of
wires and split-ring resonators embedded into a nonlin-
ear dielectric can be controlled by varying the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld intensity in such a way that it may allow
switching the material properties between left- and right-
handed [6]. Since microscopic ﬁelds can be enhanced dra-
matically in a composite structure due to the split-ring
resonators, strong nonlinear eﬀects are expected to be im-
portant in such types of metamaterials, and this can stim-
ulate applications of nonlinear left-handed materials for
switching devices, limiters, and frequency conversion. In
addition, diﬀerent types of nonlinear elements can also be
easily introduced into planar left-handed transmission-
line structures [4] making a response of such a structure
strongly nonlinear.

In this Letter, we study,

for the ﬁrst time to our
knowledge, self-trapping of electromagnetic waves and
the formation of spatial solitons in nonlinear left-handed
composite media, and ﬁnd the conditions for the exis-
tence of both TE- and TM-polarized bright and dark
solitons [7]. We demonstrate that left-handed materials
with a hysteresis-type (multi-stable) nonlinear magnetic

response support novel and unique types of single- and
multi-hump (symmetric, antisymmetric, or even asym-
metric) backward-wave spatial electromagnetic solitons
due to the eﬀective domains corresponding to diﬀerent
branches of nonlinear magnetic permeability.

We consider a nonlinear composite structure described,
within an eﬀective medium approximation, by the non-
linear magnetic permeability of the form [6]

where H is the applied magnetic ﬁeld, F is a ﬁlling factor
of the composite, ω0N L is a nonlinear eigenfrequency of
the split-ring resonator, and Γ is the loss coeﬃcient. We
assume that the inﬁlling dielectric of the structure has a
Kerr-like nonlinear response,

where ǫD0 is the linear dielectric permittivity, Ec is a
characteristic electric ﬁeld of a nonlinear response, and
α = ±1 stands for focussing or defocusing nonlinearity,
respectively. Here we neglect the dependence of the eﬀec-
tive dielectric permittivity on the electric ﬁeld assuming
that a nonlinear dielectric ﬁlls only the slits of the split-
ring resonators, as discussed in Ref. [6].

Dependence of the nonlinear eigenfrequency of split-
ring resonators on the macroscopic magnetic ﬁeld H can
[6]),
be found in an implicit form (see Eq. (11) of Ref.

resonator, Γ′ = Γ/ω0 is the normalized damping coeﬃ-
cient, c is the speed of light, dg, h, a are the resonator
parameters, and the magnetic ﬁeld H is normalized to
the critical electric ﬁeld Ec.

When the losses are negligible, the dependence of the
magnetic permeability on the normalized magnetic ﬁeld
H can have several distinct forms [6]. The most interest-
ing, multi-valued dependence is shown in the inset Fig. 1
for the defocusing nonlinearity and Ω > 1.

FIG. 2: (color online) Examples of diﬀerent types of solitons:
(a) fundamental soliton; (b,c) solitons with one domain of
negative or positive magnetic permeability (shaded), respec-
tively; (d) soliton with two diﬀerent domains (shaded). Insets
in (b,c) show the magniﬁed regions of the steep change of the
magnetic ﬁeld.

multi-stability, the type of the phase trajectories is de-
ﬁned by the corresponding branch of the multi-valued
magnetic permeability. Correspondingly, diﬀerent types
of the spatial solitons appear when the phase trajecto-
ries correspond to the diﬀerent branches of the nonlinear
magnetic permeability.

The fundamental soliton is described by the separa-
trix trajectory on the plane (H, dH/dx) that starts at
the point (0, 0), goes around the center point (0, H1),
and then returns back [see Fig. 1, solid curve]; the cor-
responding soliton proﬁle is shown in Fig. 2(a). More
complex solitons are formed when the magnetic perme-
ability becomes multi-valued and is described by several
branches. Then, soliton solutions are obtained by switch-
ing between the separatrix trajectories corresponding to
diﬀerent (upper and lower) branches of magnetic per-
meability. Continuity of the tangential components of
the electric and magnetic ﬁelds at the boundaries of the
domains with diﬀerent values of magnetic permeability
implies that both H and dH/dx should be continuous.
As a result, the transitions between diﬀerent phase tra-
jectories should be continuous.

Figures 2(b,c) show several examples of the more com-
plex solitons corresponding to a single jump to the lower
branch of µ(H) (dotted) and to the upper branch of µ(H)
(dashed), respectively. The insets show the magniﬁed
domains of a steep change of the magnetic ﬁeld. Both
the magnetic ﬁeld and its derivative, proportional to the
tangential component of the electric ﬁeld, are continu-
ous. The shaded areas show the eﬀective domains where
the value of magnetic permeability changes. Figure 2(d)
shows an example of more complicated multi-hump soli-
ton which includes two domains of the eﬀective magnetic
permeability, one described by the lower branch, and the
other one – by the upper branch. In a similar way, we
can ﬁnd more complicated solitons with diﬀerent number

of domains of the eﬀective magnetic permeability.

We note that some of the phase trajectories have dis-
continuity of the derivative at H = 0 caused by inﬁnite
values of the magnetic permeability at the correspond-
ing branch of µeﬀ(H). Such a non-physical eﬀect is an
artifact of the lossless model of a left-handed nonlinear
composite considered here for the analysis of the soliton
solutions.
In more realistic models that include losses,
the region of multi-stability does not extend to the point
H = 0, and in this limit the magnetic permeability re-
mains a single-valued function of the magnetic ﬁeld [6].
For such a multi-valued nonlinear magnetic response,
the domains with diﬀerent values of the magnetic per-
meability ”excited” by the spatial soliton can be viewed
as eﬀective induced left-handed waveguides which make
possible the existence of single- and multi-hump soliton
structures. Due to the existence of such domains, the
solitons can be not only symmetric, but also antisym-
metric and even asymmetric. Formally, the size of an ef-
fective domain can be much smaller than the wavelength
and, therefore, there exists an applicability limit for the
obtained results to describe nonlinear waves in realistic
composite structures.

Nonlinear dispersion of several types of spatial solitons
is shown in Fig. 3 as the dependence of the soliton energy
ﬂow vs. the normalized propagation constant γ. The fun-
damental soliton exists in a limited range of γ. The lower
boundary is determined by the threshold value γtr. At
the upper boundary, the amplitude of the soliton ﬁeld ex-
ceeds the critical value H ∗, and the magnetic permeabil-
ity becomes positive. All spatial solitons are backward

the direction opposite to the wavevector, as indicated by
the negative sign of power ﬂow.

When the inﬁlling dielectric of the structure displays
self-focusing nonlinear response, we have Ω < 1, and in
such system we can ﬁnd dark solitons, i.e. localized dips
on the ﬁnite-amplitude background wave [7]. Similar to
bright solitons, there exist both fundamental dark soli-
tons and dark solitons with domains of diﬀerent values
of magnetic permeability. For self-defocusing nonlinear-
ity and Ω < 1, magnetic permeability is a single-valued
function, and such a nonlinear response can support dark
solitons as well, whereas for self-focusing dielectric, and
Ω > 1, no solitons can exist. Thus, in the composite with
self-defocusing dielectric, depending on the frequency of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld, either bright or dark solitons
can exist.

TE-polarized solitons. The TE-polarized waves are de-
scribed by one component of the electric ﬁeld and two
components of the magnetic ﬁeld. For such waves, mag-
netic permeability depends on two components of the
magnetic ﬁeld and the analysis of localized modes be-
comes more involved.

We look for the waves propagating in the z−direction,

E = y0Eeiωt−ihz, H = (x0Hx + z0iHz)eiωt−ihz,

where (x0, y0, z0) are the unit vectors, and E, Hx, and
Hz are scalar real amplitudes of the ﬁelds. A constant

Similar to the TM-polarized waves, the phase trajec-
tory on the plane (Hx, Hz) is deﬁned by a particular
branch of the multi-valued nonlinear magnetic perme-
ability. Near the origin (0, 0), the phase trajectory is

4

deﬁned by the solid branch of the magnetic permeabil-
ity [see Fig. 1(inset)]. In general, the phase diagram has
three equilibrium states, which are similar to those de-
scribed above for the TM-polarized waves. A singularity
curve (thick solid line) is deﬁned by the vanishing de-
nominator in the second equation of Eqs. (6). The phase
trajectories represented by dotted curves change their di-
rection when they cross the singularity line.

For a homogeneous structure with the nonlinear mag-
netic permeability shown by a solid curve in Fig. 1(inset),
the separatrix curve on the phase plane of Fig. 4 de-
scribes the fundamental two-component TE-polarized
spatial solitons with a smooth envelope. However, there
exist more complex TE-polarized solitons, and such soli-
tons include eﬀective domains with diﬀerent values of the
multi-valued magnetic permeability. At the boundaries
of the domains, both the ﬁelds Hx and Hz/µ should be
continuous. As a result, the phase trajectories describ-
ing the TE-polarized solitons with such domains will be
discontinuous on the plane (Hx, Hz). In Fig. 5, we show
the energy ﬂow for the family of the fundamental soli-
tons and two types of solitons with a single domain, as
the functions of the normalized propagation constant γ.
Example of the solitons presented here correspond to a
symmetric dependence of the x-component of the mag-
netic ﬁeld; however, both antisymmetric and asymmetric
TE-polarized solitons can exist in the structure as well.

In conclusion, we have analyzed both TE- and TM-
polarized self-trapped nonlinear localized beams – spatial
electromagnetic solitons – in left-handed metamaterials
with nonlinear resonant response. We have revealed the
existence of unique types of solitons supported by the
hysteresis-type magnetic nonlinearity and the domains
with diﬀerent values of magnetic permeability. Such soli-
tons can have symmetric, antisymmetric, or asymmetric
structure. We believe that similar solitons can be found
in other types of complex nonlinear materials with left-
handed properties or the frequency-dependent domains
corresponding to negative refraction.

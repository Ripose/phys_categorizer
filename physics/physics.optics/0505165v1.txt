Ordinary metallic photonic crystals (PCs) have photonic band gaps in which the density of states
(DOS) is strongly modiﬁed. Thermal emission of photons can be suppressed and enhanced accord-
ingly. We consider the thermal emission characteristics of a metallic photonic crystal slab with a
tunable thickness which in the thick limit approaches that of a photonic crystal and in the thin limit
approaches that of a textured surface. We ﬁnd that a thick photonic crystal suppresses emission in
a speciﬁc range while a thin slab suppresses low frequency emission.

The study of thermal emission has be an active sub-
ject of research area for many years.1,2 At thermal equi-
librium, the emissivity of a material at each frequency
is equal to its absorptivity, if the transmittance is zero.
This makes metals good thermal radiators at infrared
and optical frequencies as common metals are usually
good absorbers in these frequency ranges. Recent devel-
opments of photonic crystals has opened a new arena in
controlling the absorption spectrum.3,4,5,6,7,8 If we want
to suppress radiation at infrared frequencies, then by ma-
nipulating the geometry and materials parameters, one
can design a metallic photonic crystal with large band
gaps over the infrared frequencies. This makes the study
of thermal emission by photonic crystals a fruitful re-
search area, which has witnessed a rapid growth in re-
cently years. However in reality, diﬃculties arise in fab-
ricating three-dimensional (3D) photonic crystals, which
prohibits its potential applications. Recently, Fleming
et al.9 reported that only one layer of photonic crystal
is suﬃcient to achieve strong attenuation of electromag-
netic radiation. Regarding to their ﬁndings, here we pro-
pose a model system which only consists of a tungsten
micro-particle layer, sitting on a thick tungsten slab. The
present geometry exhibits excellent enhancement of ab-
sorption in the range of optical frequencies, while sup-
pressing the absorption in other frequency ranges.

We begin by considering a tungsten face-centered cu-
bic (FCC) photonic crystal with a lattice constant a=
0.5 µm,
for simplicity, the spherical tungsten micro-
particles are embedded in a background medium with
a dielectric ǫ0=1. The interparticle distance α is given
by α = a/√2 = 0.354 µm and the ﬁlling ratio f is given
by f = 0.65 (r = 0.169 µm). The absorbance (A), re-
ﬂectance (R) and transmittance (T ) as well as the pho-
tonic band structure are calculated by using multiple-
scattering formalism.10 It should be noted that, the
present geometry is not the only method of choice, but it
allows us to use the multiple-scattering formalism, which
has be proven to have a high accuracy and is less com-
putational costly than the ﬁnite-diﬀerent time domain
(FDTD) method.11

In Fig. 1, we show the photonic band structure of the
FCC tungsten photonic crystal. As seen, its band struc-
ture exhibits a large directional band gap at infrared fre-

quencies, which suggests that the tungsten photonic crys-
tal can eﬀectively suppress the infrared radiation. How-
ever, it should be noted that the band structure calcu-
lation was based on an inﬁnite lattice structure, while a
realistic PC is constructed by a ﬁnite number of parti-
cle layers. Here one may ask how many layers are suf-
ﬁcient for the purpose of thermal emission? And more
importantly, is it possible to use just one layer of (metal-
lic) particles? In order to explore the answer to these
questions, we consider a model system which consists
of a single (111) layer of tungsten particles and a tung-
sten slab only. The tungsten slab is acting as a sub-
strate and it also ensures the overall transmittance is
zero at all frequencies. The tungsten slab is put at a
distance l behind the center of the tungsten particles,
with l = 0.5α = 0.177 µm, which is very close to the

compare it with the absorbance spectrum of a 128 layers
tungsten photonic crystal. Again, the number of layers
(128) is chosen such that no light can be transmitted.
The spectra can be approximately separated into a high-
frequency (ω > 0.9 eV) region and a low-frequency region
(ω < 0.9 eV). At high-frequencies, the absorbance of the
proposed ‘layer + slab’ (LS) surface (ALS) is close to that

nitude of the real part of the dielectric constant (ǫr(ω))
drops more than 80%, and decreases gradually after 0.9
eV, while its imaginary part only has a small ﬂuctuation.
The decrease of the dielectric mismatch between 0.6 eV
and 0.9 eV allows more photons to penetrate into the ma-
terial, which results in the pronounced increase of ALS.
This can also be observed for a tungsten slab (Aslab). In
Fig. 3, we replace tungsten by copper and plot the ab-
sorbance spectra. Again, there is a benchmark at ω
≈
2.2 eV where ALS is very close to APC for ω > 2.2 eV
and the drastic increase of the absorbance for a copper
slab stops accordingly. The physical reason of this is the
same as that of tungsten.

We are now at a position to compare the thermal emis-
sion spectra between the ‘layer + slab’ surface and the
128 layers photonic crystal. We will consider the case
of tungsten only because its melting point (
3700 K)
is much higher than that of copper (
1360 K), which
makes tungsten a more feasible material as a thermal
emitter, the results are shown in Fig. 4. The thermal
emission spectrum is calculated by assuming Kirchhoﬀ’s
law,1 the thermal emission spectrum uk(λ, T ) of wavevec-
tor k at temperature T is given by:

of the photonic crystal (APC) for ω > 0.9 eV. In partic-
ular, ALS is only 0.7% and 1.4% smaller than APC at
3.11 eV (λ = 0.4 µm) and 1.78 eV (λ = 0.7 µm) respec-
tively. Thus the present micro-textured surface should
be a good thermal emitter at optical frequencies. At
low-frequencies ALS is smaller than APC in general. It is
interesting to note there is a sharp increase of ALS be-
tween 0.3 eV and 0.5 eV. This is arising from the surface
induced coupling between the particles and the slab sur-
face, which is a Fabry-Perot eﬀect. However in reality, it
is diﬃcult to observe such coupling as the surfaces of the
particles and the slab are not perfect in general. We also
observe a suppression in APC between 0.7 eV and 0.9 eV,
which is due to photonic bandgap eﬀect. The reason of
choosing 0.9 eV as a benchmark is not only phenomeno-

electric constant is important at microwave and infrared
frequencies.13,14 However, as our primary interest is to
compare the diﬀerences between the ‘layer + slab’ sur-
face and the photonic crystal, the study of the tempera-
ture eﬀect is beyond the scope of this work and is thus
ignored. In Fig. 4, we show the thermal emission spec-
trum of the ‘layer + slab’ surface (uLS) at 2500 K and
compare it with that of a 128 layers photonic crystal
(uPC). We also plot the spectrum of a ‘4 layers + slab’
(u4LS) to show the eﬀects of extra layers. In all cases,

the infrared part of the spectrum is eﬀectively suppressed
and the optical spectrum is close to that of a blackbody
radiation, thus the emission peaks of both spectra are
blue-shifted. Additionally, the ‘layer + slab’ geometry
emits less photons than that of the photonic crystal in
the range 1.2 < λ < 3.0 µm, a direct consequence due
to the small absorbance [Fig. 2]. Next we compare the
spectra uLS and u4LS. At short-wavelengths (λ < 1.35
µm), the addition of extra layers only has an insignif-
icant enhancement on the emission spectrum.
In fact,
u4LS almost coincides with uPC in this region. In other
words, only a few layers of tungsten particles are suf-
ﬁcient for the purpose of optical emission, which is in
accordance with the results of Fleming et al.9 We will
have a detailed discussion about the layer dependency in
the next paragraph.

FIG. 5: Absorbance spectra of tungsten photonic crystals
with diﬀerent numbers of (111) layers, N = 1, 2, 4, 32, 64 and
128 (various lines with symbols). The absorbance spectrum
of a tungsten slab is also shown (dashed line). The absorption
is enhanced by the photonic crystals at all frequencies.

The results of Figs. 2 and 4 suggest that, if compared
with a 3D photonic crystal, a single tungsten particle
layer should be a better choice as a thermal emitter at
optical frequencies. On one hand it absorbs more op-
tical photons than a thick slab does, and on the other
hand the absorption of long-wavelength electromagnetic
waves is also suppressed. It is thus instructive to exam-
ine the layer-dependence of the absorbance spectrum. In
Fig. 5, we show the absorbance spectra of tungsten pho-
tonic crystals with diﬀerent numbers of (111) layers (N ).
As expected, each photonic crystal has its absorbance
exceeds that of a thick tungsten slab at all frequencies.
At low-frequencies, we observe a N -dependency of the
absorbance. This N -dependency stops until the num-
ber of layers is suﬃciently large (N
128), where all
the photos penetrating into the photonic crystal are ab-
sorbed by the tungsten particles. We postpone the dis-
cussion of this N -dependency until later. We now con-

centrate on the high frequencies region, in this region,
a tungsten particle layer has a signiﬁcant enhancement
of absorbance over that of a thick tungsten slab. Un-
like the case of low-frequencies, the absorbance is nearly
N -independent for N
2, indicating that the attenua-
tion is dominated by the ﬁrst layer. Physically speaking,
if one constructs a multi-layers photonic crystal, the sec-
ond layer will further absorb the photons penetrating the
ﬁrst layer, and the absorption will then be saturated. It
explains the N -independency of absorbance for N
2
in Fig. 5. We then turn to the region ω < 0.9 eV. In
this region, the absorbance of a tungsten particle layer is
almost the same as that of a tungsten slab. In the case of
a slab, all the unabsorbed photons are reﬂected and no
transmission of photos is allowed, and absorbance spec-
trum depends solely on the dielectric parameter of tung-
sten, while in the case of a particle layer, photons can
penetrate at all frequencies, owing to the fact that the
tungsten particles are not touching each others. Thus in
a photonic crystal each layer will help absorbing the ex-
cess (long-wavelength) electromagnetic waves scattered
by previous layer. This accounts for the N -dependency
of absorbance at low-frequencies. At moderate frequen-
cies (0.7 < ω < 0.9 eV), the absorption is suppressed by
photonic bandgap eﬀect.

Here a few comments are in order. The results of Fig. 2
and Fig. 4 suggest that, in order to emit the same amount
of light, less energy will be required to heat the micro-
textured surface, which is an advantage over the pho-
tonic crystal. The fabrication of the tungsten particle
layer can be done by cutting-age techniques such as self-
assembly.15,16 Recently, Lu et al.17 demonstrated a novel
technique in fabricating high-density silver nanoparticle
layer. The interparticle distance is tunable and can be
controlled precisely. Their technique can be adopted to
fabricate a tungsten particle ﬁlm. It should also be em-
phasized that our discussion here should be general for
any 3D metallic photonic crystals. If one optimizes the
geometric and materials, the suppression of absorption
below a deﬁnite frequency can be accomplished by only
a few (in our case, one) building blocks of photonic crys-
tals. If the purpose is to suppress the absorption within
a certain frequency range, one has to utilize the photonic
bandgap eﬀect and determine how many unit cells is nec-
essary.

In this letter, we have proposed the use of a simple,
micro-textured surface as a thermal emitter. We have
studied its thermal emission behavior and compare it
with that of a tungsten photonic crystal. The results sug-
gest such geometry would be a promising thermal emit-
ter. It is hoped that our study would inspire new ideas
in the design of thermal emitting applications.

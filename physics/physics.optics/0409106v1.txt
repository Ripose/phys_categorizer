Abstract

We report the observation of the self-guided propagation of 120 fs, 0.56 mJ infrared radiation

in air for distances greater than one meter.

In contrast to the known case of ﬁlamentation, in

the present experiment the laser power is lower than the collapse threshold. Therefore the counter

balance between Kerr self focussing and ionization induced defocussing as the stabilizing mechanism

is ruled out. Instead, we ﬁnd evidences of a process in which the transversal beam distribution

reshapes into a form similar to a Townes soliton. We include numerical support for this conclusion.

Spontaneous guiding of intense femtosecond laser beams is a relevant consequence of

propagation in non-linear media. It was ﬁrst observed by Braun et al

[1] in the form of light

ﬁlaments extending over a distance of 20 meters. This triggered an intense experimental

and theoretical research to better understand the underlying mechanism as well as to de-

velop practical applications of the phenomena. Fundamentally, the light channels appear in

situations in which a compromise between collapse and expansion of the transversal beam

proﬁle is possible. In the most known case, self-channeling at high laser powers, these oppo-

site trends come from the self-focussing eﬀect in Kerr media and the dispersion induced by

the inhomogeneous refractive index resulting from ionization [2]. In this case, a ﬁlament of

light can be spontaneously formed when the self focussing is strong enough to produce the

collapse of the beam. The increased intensity in the focus produces ionization and, thus,

a change in the refraction index that counterbalances the Kerr focussing. However, this

mechanism is not unique: In this paper we report the observation of this sort of structures

for intensities below the critical power of collapse. In this case, ionization does not play a

relevant role, and the counter acting mechanism combines the focussing power of the Kerr

eﬀect with the beam diﬀraction. Neglecting the retardation eﬀects of the dispersive medium,

the propagation of the laser beam can be described by a non-linear Schr¨odinger equation in

the transverse coordinates. In particular, for the cylindric symmetric case we have

where k0 is the wave vector of the laser radiation, n0 is the refraction index in air, and
n2 is the non-linear refraction index (3.2 × 10−19 cm2/W). Note that Eq. (1) is derived

according to the slowly varying envelope approximation (SVEA). As a result, the temporal

coordinate factorizes and every time slice of the electromagnetic pulse evolves independently.
U(r, z, t) is deﬁned as the time dependent ﬁeld envelope U0g(r, z, t), so that U 2

rdrdzdt|g(r, z, t)|2, Ein being the input energy of the beam. A singular aspect

with V =

of Eq. (1) is the possibility of localized self-trapped solutions, or solitons. In particular,

R

the so-called Townes soliton [3]. This kind of solutions reﬂect situations in which diﬀraction

is counterbalanced by self focussing and, therefore, represent transversal self trapping of a

portion of the laser beam. The observation of such structure generated after the propagation

of an infrared beam through 30cm of BK7 glass has already been reported in [4]. However,

2

the stability of this structure was not investigated. This is an important point, since the

Townes solution is known to be unstable under small energy ﬂuctuations of the trapped ﬁeld

[5]. The instability leads to the destruction of the self-trapping in the form of a catastrophic

collapse or the transversal spread of beam. Under these circumstances, the extension of the

light channel in experiments depends strongly on the degree of approximation to the actual

soliton shape. On one side, in this paper we report for the ﬁrst time the observation of the

Townes proﬁle in air. Having in mind its unstable nature, the formation of this structure

in medium with random ﬂuctuations is a relevant ﬁnding. On the other side, we report the

stability of the self-trapped channel over more than 1.5 m.

Figure 1 shows schematically the experimental setup employed in this experiment. A

120 fs, 790 nm Ti:Sa laser pulse (1 cm transversal FWHM) is focussed in air with a 2.2

m focal lens, right after passing through pinhole (radius 0.25 cm). A BK7 plate, located

at a variable distance form the focal spot, is used to intercept the beam. The transversal

energy distribution of the beam is recorded by imaging the plate with a CCD camera. The

appropriate control of the energy of the input beam is obtained with the combination of

a variable angle λ/2 plate followed by a linear polarizer with ﬁxed axis. The experiments

where performed at 0.11 mJ and 0.56 mJ input energies (measured right after the pinhole).

In both cases the associated powers fall below the critical power for collapse due to Kerr self-

focussing in air. This has been checked experimentally and also theoretically observing the

propagation of the incident beam unmasked by the pinhole (see Fig. 3c for the theoretical

result). The absence of any radiation channel or ﬁlament in this case rules out the possibility

of collapse.

Our experimental results for the beam propagation after the focus are condensed in

Fig. 2. Both plots outline the main features of the beam cross section found at diﬀerent

distances from the focussing lens. In particular, the radii corresponding to the widths at

25, 50 and 75% of the maximum energy detected by the CCD camera at diﬀerent locations

of the intercepting plate. The insets correspond to the readout from the CCD camera at

a particular position (≃ 460 cm). Figure 2a depicts the low energy case (0.11 mJ). The

transversal energy distribution is found to be very close to the expected using the Fresnel

diﬀraction formula, i.e. a ring structure that appear roughly 1 m after the focal spot and

can be traced over 3 m before a new diﬀraction maximum appears at the center of the beam.

In contrast, Figure 2b corresponds to the higher energy case (0.56 mJ), and demonstrates

3

completely diﬀerent features: a pronounced maximum at the center of the beam followed by

a more slow decay of the energy for the larger radii. This center structure is very similar to

the reported in [4], for a diﬀerent propagating medium. It has been identiﬁed with a Townes

soliton proﬁle immersed in a background which corresponds to the linear diﬀraction of the

lower energy part of the pulse. A relevant aspect described in Fig. 2b, and the central result

of the present paper, is the stability of this distribution over more than 1.5 m. The stability

of the beam channel in our results suggest that the central peak in the energy distribution

is rather close to the actual Townes soliton proﬁle. This result corresponds to a self-guiding

situation in which an appreciable fraction of the beam energy propagates in a central channel

with radius of some hundreds of microns (a situation similar to the ﬁlamentation in air with

higher intensities).

Further conﬁrmation of the above interpretation can be drawn form the numerical inte-

gration of Eq. (1) with the initial conditions appropriate to describe the pinhole-lens system.

As noted above, this equation describes the propagation of a time slice of the electromag-

netic pulse. We have chosen, therefore, to investigate the dynamics of the slice corresponding

to the maximum intensity. Figures 3a and b show the computed energy distributions for

the same cases as in ﬁgure 2. In the lower energy case, the central part of the beam after

the focal point is rapidly depleted, forming the Fresnel diﬀraction ring. In correspondence

with the experimental ﬁnding, the higher energy case (Fig. 3b) shows a central maximum

(marked with an arrow) which decays after one or two meters. While the experimental and

theoretical results agree quantitatively in the case of lowest energy, the agreement for 0.56

mJ is only qualitative. To retrieve the CCD readout form the theoretical point of view,

one has to integrate the computations for diﬀerent time slides accordingly to the actual

temporal shape of the pulse. Unfortunately, in our case we have access only to the pulse

autocorrelation information, which gives indirect information about the pulse shape. Our

checks assuming an ideal gaussian temporal proﬁle do not provide a quantitative agreement

satisfactory enough.

In [4], the identiﬁcation of the Townes proﬁle is obtained by best ﬁt of the structure

central maximum with the actual proﬁle of the soliton. Our numerical calculations permit

us to be slightly more rigorous. The Townes soliton corresponds to a localized eigenstate

of Eq. (1): Ut(r, z) =

It(r) exp(−iptz). If we express U(r, z) =

I(r, z) exp[iφ(r, z)] as

the central peak of the solution of Eq. (1) plotted in Fig. 3b, the assimilation with the

q

q

soliton requires: I(r, z) ≃ It(r) and ∂φ(r, z)/∂z ≃ pt (constant). The ﬁrst condition implies

I(r, z) localized and to follow a selfsimilar evolution in z [4]. The localization of the central

maximum in Fig. 3b is evident, and the selfsimilarity along the z coordinate has been found

in good approximation. The second condition, i.e. the eigenstate nature, can be considered

as the fundamental test. Figure 4a shows ∂φ(r, z)/∂z for the non-linear case of Fig. 3b.

The arrow indicates the position of the maximum of the central energy distribution. The

ﬂatness of the surface indicates that the condition ∂φ(r, z)/∂z ≃ pt is well attained in the

region where the central structure is deﬁned.

As commented before, the stability of the soliton solution reﬂects a very subtile balance

between diﬀraction dispersion and Kerr self focussing. Hence, the ﬁnal achievement of a

selftrapped solution depends fundamentally in the initial conditions (amplitude and phase

distribution) of the ﬁeld. In our case, the diﬀraction pattern generated by the pinhole seems

to be of fundamental importance. To show that this is indeed the case, we have performed

experiments and simulations of the case corresponding to the 0.56 mJ, but removing the

pinhole. Note, that as the ﬁeld is not screened, the initial beam proﬁle is now gaussian with

an energy sensibly higher. In this case the beam expansion after the focal point does not

lead to a channel structure, and has the same characteristics as the theoretical plotted in

Fig. 3b. On the other hand, the phase distribution does not permit the identiﬁcation of a

single eigenstate, as becomes apparent in ﬁgure 4b.

We have reported the spontaneous generation of a narrow channel of radiation in the

propagation of a short electromagnetic pulse in air, for energies below the energy threshold

in which ionized ﬁlaments are possible. We have identiﬁed this channel (which extends over

more that 1.5 m) as a structure that approximates closely to a a Townes soliton, hence

particularly stable.

( 5 mm diameter) and is focussed by a lens (f =2.2 m). The pulse energy is selected by the

combination of a λ/2 plate and a linear polarizer at adequate angles. After propagating through

the focal point, the transversal beam proﬁle is imaged using a BK7 plate and a CCD camera. Once

the energy is measured, the powermeter is removed from the path of the laser beam towards the

BK7 plate.

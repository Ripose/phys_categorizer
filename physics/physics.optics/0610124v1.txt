The temporal response of two-wave-mixing in photorefractive InP:Fe under a dc electric ﬁeld at
diﬀerent temperatures has been studied. In particular, the temperature dependence of the charac-
teristic time constant has been studied both theoretically and experimentally, showing a strongly
decreasing time constant with increasing temperature.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The photorefractive eﬀect leads to a variety of nonlin-
ear optical phenomena in certain types of crystals. The
basic mechanism of the eﬀect is the excitation and re-
distribution of charge carriers inside a crystal as a result
of non-uniform illumination. The redistributed charges
give rise to a non-uniform internal electric ﬁeld and thus
to spatial variations in the refractive index of the crystal
through the Pockels eﬀect. Signiﬁcant nonlinearity can
be induced by relatively weak (µW) laser radiation. Phe-
nomena such as self-focusing, energy coupling between
two coherent laser beams, self-pumped phase conjuga-
tion, chaos, pattern formation and spatial soliton have
attracted much attention in the past 20 years [1, 2].

Among photorefractive crystals, semiconductor mate-
rials have attractive properties for applications in optical
telecommunications such as optical switching and rout-
ing. This is due to the fact that they are sensitive in
the infrared region and their response time can be fast
(µs)[3].
Two-wave-mixing is an excellent tool to characterize the
photorefractive eﬀect in these materials [4, 5, 6] by de-
termining the gain of ampliﬁcation under the inﬂuence
of the applied ﬁeld, impurity densities, or grating period.
Some semiconductors, like InP:Fe, exhibit an intensity
dependant resonance at stabilized temperatures [4, 5].

In this paper, we analyze the temperature dependance
of Two-Wave-Mixing (TWM) characteristic time con-
stant, theoretically at ﬁrst and eventually against exper-
imental results. We propose a formal description of the
temporal evolution of carrier densities in the medium,
linking them to the TWM gain temporal evolution.

II. TIME DEPENDANT SPACE-CHARGE
FIELD IN InP : F e

The basic principles of the photorefractive eﬀect in
InP:Fe are well known [6]. It involves three steps: pho-

toexcitation of trapped carriers into excited states, mi-
gration of excited carriers preferentially towards non-
illuminated regions and capture into empty deep centers.
This leads to the formation of a local space-charge ﬁeld
Esc and thus to the modulation of the refractive index.
The modulated refraction index is then able to interact
with the beams that have created it. When the modula-
tion stems from beam interference as in two wave mixing,
an energy transfer between beams may occur.

The principle of two-wave-mixing is to propagate si-
multaneously in a photorefractive crystal two coherent
beams, which have an angle θ between their directions of
propagation. This phenomena is governed by the follow-
ing system of coupled nonlinear diﬀerential equations:

dIs
dz
dIp
dz

=

=

Γ.Is.Ip
I0
−Γ.Is.Ip

− α.Is

− α.Ip

(1)

(2)

where Ip is the pump intensity, Is is the signal intensity,
and I0 is the total intensity equal to the sum Is + Ip,
α is the absorption coeﬃcient (assumed here to be the
same for pump and signal). In a photorefractive crystal,
Γ takes the following form [5]:

Γ0 = (

2.π.n3.ref f
λ. cos θ

).Im{Esc}

(3)

where n is the refractive index, ref f is the eﬀective
electro-optic coeﬃcient, λ is the beam wavelength in vac-
uum and Im{Esc} is the imaginary part of the space-
charge ﬁeld Esc(the π
2 shifted component of Esc with re-
spect to the illumination grating). The expression of Esc
will derived in the following lines. θ is the angle between
the two beams.

In order to evaluate the photorefractive gain Γ0 given
by equation (3), the space-charge ﬁeld Esc has to be cal-
culated from the modiﬁed Kukhtarev model [7], taking
into account both electrons and holes as charge carriers.
We chose a model with one deep center donor, two types

only in one transversal dimension (x) as described by the

In the following, we have calculated the temporal evo-
lution of carriers density and we will look forward to ﬁnd-
ing the temporal evolution of the space charge ﬁeld under
these hypothesis, i.e. considering only the zero’th and
ﬁrst order of the Fourier expansion.

The zero’th order corresponds to an uniform illumina-
tion ( I(x) = I0). The space charge ﬁeld is thus equal to
zero and the local ﬁeld is uniform and equals the applied
ﬁeld Eapp. The electrons and holes densities at steady
state are known to be equal to en.nT0
respec-
cn.pT0
tively [5], where nT0 , pT0 are the density of occupied and
unoccupied traps at steady state.

and ep.pT0
cp.nT0

The electrons and holes densities in transient regime
when an uniform illumination is established, are calcu-
lated by solving equations (4d) and (4e) , assuming that
I0 = 0 for t < 0 and at time t = 0, the carriers density
values are equal to n0 and p0 at thermal equilibrium,
without any optical excitations [2]. We obtained the fol-
lowing solution:

where the thermal contribution to the emission rate co-
eﬃcient is eth and the optical cross section of the carriers
is given by σ, I(x) is the spatially dependent intensity of
light due to the interferences between pump and signal
beams and hν is the photon energy.

For suﬃciently small modulation depth m, intensity
and all carriers densities may be expanded into Fourier
series interrupted after the ﬁrst term :

ne(t) =

e−cnpT0 t(cnpT0 n0 + (−1 + ecnpT0 t)nT0 (eth

A(x) = A0 + A1eiKgx

where A(x) takes the role of I, ne, ph, nT , pT and Kg
the spatial frequency of the interference pattern. So the
light intensity can be written for the average intensity I0

form illumination is illustrated in ﬁgure 1. Our model
conﬁrms the fact that the carrier densities evolution
grows exponentially. The rise time of carriers genera-
tion is on the order of nanosecond time scale for a beam
intensity of a few mW per cm2. Without presence of
the beam, the electron density is greater than the hole
density because electrons are mostly generated thermally
while holes are generated optically [5].

For a modulated intensity (ﬁrst Fourier order), by us-
ing the set of equations (4), the space-charge ﬁeld can be
approximatively expressed at steady state as [5]:

σp.pT0 .h.ν is the resonance intensity deﬁned as the inten-
sity at which holes and electrons are generated at the
same rate.

From equation (11), we observe that the space charge
ﬁeld is purely imaginary, when the illumination I0 equals
Ires. Above resonance, the hole density is higher than
the electron one, mainly because the holes cross section
is stronger than for electrons. The result is that charge
transfer mainly occurs between iron level and the valence
band. Below resonance, when electrons are dominant,
the iron mainly interacts with the electrons and the con-
duction band.
In transient regime for a modulated intensity, the dy-
namics of the space charge ﬁeld is calculated by consid-
ering an adiabatic approximations [9], a concentration of
electrons and holes densities reaches instantaneously the
equilibrium value which depends on the actual concentra-
tion of ﬁlled and empty traps, so we set: dph
dt = 0.
We assume that the electrons are excited thermally while
the holes optically [5]. In the low modulation approxima-
tion, some algebraic manipulations of the set of equations
(4) lead to:

To obtain τp, wp and τdi,p, the index p should be sub-
stituted for the index n in the equations (14), (15) and
(16).
From equations (12) to (17), it is possible to deduce, as
was done previously [4, 5], that the time constant τg is
real if electron emission is equal to the hole emission.
That is, in the case of InP:Fe, electron thermal-emission
is equal to the holes optical-emission. This allows to in-
fer a link between the behavior of InP:Fe as a function
of intensity and temperature.
It will be the aim of the following sections to conﬁrm this
link, both theoretically and experimentally

The photorefractive gain Γ is the main parameter that
can be determined by two-wave-mixing. It quantiﬁes an
energy transfer from the pump beam to the signal beam
and is proportional to the imaginary part of the space-
charge ﬁeld.

The gain value depends on diﬀerent parameters like ap-
plied electric ﬁeld, iron density NT , pump intensity and
temperature [11]. Our work concentrate on the study of
the gain dynamics versus temperature and we particu-
larly analyze the dependance of the rise time on temper-

ature at three diﬀerent intensities. The time constant at the
resonance intensity is given for each temperature by the dot-

perature increases. At resonance, τr is larger because the
space charge ﬁeld is high and it consequently necessitates
more charge to accumulate.

IV. AVERAGE GAIN

The theoretical curve shown in ﬁgure 2, illustrates the
temporal evolution of the local gain. For the InP:Fe sam-
ple, the absorption coeﬃcient at λ = 1.06µm being ap-
proximately equal to 1cm−1. Owing to this absorption,
the mean intensity decrease along the z axis propagation.
The exponential gain would result from an integration
over the optical thickness, as described in equation 19.

The ﬁgure 4 shows temporal evolution of local and av-
erage gain for L = 12mm crystal thickness for the same
intensity; the average gain is lower because the intensity
absorption is taken into account.

The stationary value of the photorefractive gain at dif-
ferent temperatures is given by equation (3) where Esc
is given by equation (11). This expression shows that a
maximum gain is reached when I0 = Ires. This maxi-
mum corresponds to an intensity resonance [5].

We studied theoretically the temporal gain behavior
using the standard deﬁnition given by equation (18) de-
duced from equation (12) by developing Esc and τg.

Our theoretical simulations produce the curves repre-
sented on ﬁgure 2, illustrating the evolution of photore-
fractive gain as function of time for three diﬀerent pump
beam intensities: at resonance, below and above reso-
nance for the same parameters as in ﬁgure 1. We see
that the gain amplitude diﬀers from each intensity to an-
other, it takes the maximum value around resonance.

As a next step, we studied theoretically the TWM gain
time response as a function of temperature. For an easier
comparison with experimental results, in the following,
the response time is τr will be considered as the time
interval necessary for the gain to reach 90% of the ﬁrst
maximum of each curves as shown in ﬁgure 2. The re-
sponse time τr versus temperature are given in ﬁgure 3
for three distinct intensities, along with a fourth ﬁtted
curve showing the time constant at resonance intensities.
We observe that the response time quickly decays as tem-

for all intensities.

Note that, for both theory and experiments, τr value
decreases from 300 to 50 ms for an increase temperature
of 100C–showing a good quantitative result. The dis-
crepancy observed between ﬁgure 8 and 3 is partially cor-
rected by taking into account the gain integration along

Figure 8: The τr versus temperature at diﬀerent intensities.

Figure 5: Average gain characteristic time versus temperature
at three diﬀerent intensities. The time constant at the reso-
nance intensity is given for each temperature by the dotted
line.

Because of the absorption the resonance intensity for
average gain is higher than the local one for the same
temperature. As for the local gain, we calculated numer-
ically the characteristic time, in the same way. The re-
sults are shown in ﬁgure 5. We compare the results in ﬁg-
ure 3, we observe the following diﬀerences: the resonance
peaks are slightly widened because is reached within the
example for various input intensities and the peaks are
shifted towards high intensities again because of absorp-
tion. These conclusions can arise from ﬁgures 3 and 5
although they show the rise time as a function of tem-
perature.
Indeed, our calculations show that the pho-
torefractive gain and rise time are linked, so that the rise
time is the slowest for the highest gain (i.e. at resonance);
since more charges need to be accumulated.

V. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION

We perform standard two-wave mixing experiments in
co-directional conﬁguration as shown in ﬁgure 6. Pump
and signal beam intensities ratio is set to β = 50 and the
angle between pump and signal is 2θ = 120 corresponding
for an space grating Λ = 5µm. The experiments are
performed with a CW 1.06µm YAG laser.

An electric ﬁeld (10kV/cm) is applied between the <
001 > faces of InP:Fe crystal (5 × 5 × 12mm3). The light
beam is linearly polarized along the < 110 > direction
and propagates along the < 110 > direction (12mm).
The absorption constant as measured by spectrometer
is close to 1cm−1 at 1.06µm. Crystal temperature is
stabilized by a Peltier cooler.

Transient behavior is analyzed by measuring τr as was
done in ﬁgures 3 and 5. Figure 7 shows the results ob-
tained for three diﬀerent intensities from one side to the
other of the resonance (the oscillations seen on ﬁgure 7
are attributed to the experimental noise and the curves
are assumed to correspond to the ﬁrst order responses).
Experimental results concerning the TWM time constant
are given on ﬁgure 8. For high temperature, τr decreases

6

the beam path inside the crystal, as shown in ﬁgure 5,
showing a widening of the curves. We attribute the diﬀer-
ence observed in terms of gain maximum value to lack of
precision in the knowledge of the crystal’s physical con-
stants such as photo-excitation, cross section and dopant
concentration.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have studied the dynamics of TWM in InP:Fe as
a function of intensity and temperature. A theoretical

analysis shows that the gain coeﬃcient oscillates when
an intensity lower or higher than the resonance intensity
is used. At resonance the gain grows exponentially.

The experimental study shows that the crystal absorp-
tion prevents the oscillating behavior. We have shown
that the gain rise time is strongly temperature depen-
dent. Experimentally the gain rise time is 10 times
shorter at 295K than at 285K for low intensities.

According to experimental and applications needs, the
temperature as well as the intensity can be used to tune
the photorefractive response time.

Enhancing the photomixing eﬃciency of optoelectronic devices in the terahertz regime

Subrahmanyam Pilla
Department of Physics, University of California, San Diego, CA 92093∗

A method to reduce the transit time of majority of carriers in photomixers and photo detectors to
< 1 ps is proposed. Enhanced optical ﬁelds associated with surface plasmon polaritons, coupled with
velocity overshoot phenomenon results in net decrease of transit time of carriers. As an example,
model calculations demonstrating > 280× (or ∼2800 and 31.8 µW at 1 and 5 THz respectively)
improvement in THz power generation eﬃciency of a photomixer based on Low Temperature grown
GaAs are presented. Due to minimal dependence on the carrier recombination time, it is anticipated
that the proposed method paves the way for enhancing the speed and eﬃciency of photomixers and
detectors covering UV to far infrared communications wavelengths (300 to 1600 nm).

Recent experimental observation of extraordinary op-
tical transmission through a normal metal ﬁlm having
subwavelength holes[1] has generated intense interest in
harnessing the underlying physics for photonic applica-
tions. It is widely believed that quasi two-dimensional
electromagnetic excitations tightly bound to the metal
surface known as Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) are
responsible for the observed near ﬁeld enhancement of
the optical radiation. Exponential decay of ﬁeld com-
ponents arising from SPPs (penetrating ∼100, ∼10 nm
in dielectric and metal respectively), make them highly
attractive for miniature photonic circuits and devices[2].
Currently, several potential applications of SPPs are be-
ing explored including wave guiding[3] and near-ﬁeld
microscopy[4]. However, application of SPPs to enhance
the speed and eﬃciency of photo detectors or photomix-
ers has not been attempted due to the complexity of
underlying physics and optimal device designs involving
complicated dielectric-metal structures.

In this letter we propose a simple interdigitated metal
structure embedded in a suitable semiconductor ma-
terial to harness SPPs for improving the speed and
eﬃciency of photomixers and detectors.
Such a de-
vice can be realized with the existing material growth
techniques[5]. As an example, we demonstrate via model
calculations, signiﬁcant (> 280×) improvement in the
eﬃciency of a THz photomixer based on Low Temper-
ature grown GaAs (LT-GaAs). Microwave to THz ra-
diation sources in the 0.1 to 10 THz are being exten-
sively studied for their application in communications,
medical imaging, and spectroscopy[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. For
many applications- compact, narrow-linewidth, widely
tunable continuous wave sources are necessary. In par-
ticular, to be used as a local oscillator in communica-
tions systems the THz source should produce stable out-
put power > 10 µW[8, 11]. Among the various tech-
niques being pursued[6, 8, 11, 12, 13] electrical down
conversion of optical microwave sources in a suitable
photomixer[6, 11, 12] are appealing due to the easy
availability of tunable, narrow-linewidth, and stable solid
state lasers. However, until now the output power from
these photomixers is limited to < 10 µW in the cru-

FIG. 1: Schematic of FP cavity (a) and a layer of interdig-
itated metal lines (b) modelled using FDTD and FD sim-
ulators. The FP cavity is formed by 3 or 4 dielectric lay-
ers constituting DBR1, N pairs of low/high refractive index
dielectric layers constituting DBR2, and absorbing layer of
thickness D. The active volume is terminated by 15 cell
UPML layers in FDTD implementation. The lines parallel
to the x axis (width 200 nm) are connected to either sig-
nal transmission lines or planar antenna fabricated on top of
the absorbing layer (not shown). Through layer vias electri-
cally connect identical layers of interdigitated lines (b) placed
at various depths zi within the absorbing layer. The over-
all dimensions of the absorbing volume (excluding DBRs and
via leads) are given by Lx, Ly, D whereas number of in-
terdigitated metal layers, their vertical positions, (measured
from the Air-DBR1 interface), the metal line (ﬁnger) thick-
ness, pitch, width, and lengths of +ve and -ve electrodes are
given by i, zi, d, p, w,

is located at the center of top half of the interdigitated pat-
tern in (b). When the top and bottom interdigitated struc-
tures in (b) are connected in series as shown with the center
electrode grounded, the resulting structure can be excited by
lasers forming two quasi-elliptical spots. Such a radiation pat-
tern is achievable by choosing proper laser propagation mode
(such as TEM01 mode). The spacing between the two halves
is adjusted to match the beam pattern of the speciﬁc laser
system being used.

cial THz range. In a conventional Metal-Semiconductor-
Metal (MSM) photomixer[14], optically thick ( 100 nm)
interdigitated metal lines are fabricated on a high resis-
tivity semiconductor with subpicosecond recombination
time of carriers (τe/τh for electrons/holes respectively)
and high breakdown ﬁeld limit. So far, only a few materi-
als such as LT-GaAs[6, 14] and Fe implanted InGaAs[15]

have been shown to meet these requirements. From the
photomixer theory, when two lasers (wavelengths λ1, λ2,
λ0 = (λ1 +λ2)/2, and powers P1 = P2 = P0/2) with their
diﬀerence frequency f = c(λ−1
2 ) in the THz range
are incident on a dc biased photomixer[14], the THz wave
output power Pf is given by

where ip is the photocurrent generated in the external
circuit, c is velocity of light in free space, C is the ca-
pacitance, RS is small internal resistance of the metal
structure, and RL is the load resistance in the 72-200
range[6, 12, 14]. To accelerate carriers generated deep in-
side the semiconductor, high dc voltage (Vb ≈ 40 V) is ap-
plied across the electrodes. This results in ﬁelds quickly
exceeding the breakdown limit near the electrodes lead-
ing to device failure. As the carrier transport is transit
time (ttr) limited, i. e., ttr > f −1, recombination time
τ ≪ f −1 is required to recombine the carriers that do
not contribute to ip before the beat cycle reverses[12, 14].
Even if the photomixer is placed in a suitable optical cav-
ity, due to strong reﬂection from thick metal electrodes,
no carriers are generated directly below the electrodes
where ttr will be small. In addition, subwavelength fea-
tures of the metal lines produce strong near ﬁeld diﬀrac-
tion patterns that are not taken into account in conven-
tional designs[6, 12, 14].

In the present technique, we exploit SPPs for generat-
ing more carriers close to subwavelength normal metal
electrodes embedded in a photoconductor layer sand-
wiched between two Distributed Bragg Reﬂectors (DBR)
that form a Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity. When coupled with
velocity overshoot phenomenon reported in many photo-
conductor materials[12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], ttr of ma-
jority of carriers is reduced to < 1 ps, i.e., ttr ≤ f −1.
For eﬃcient use of SPPs, it is desirable to have thin
(∼10 nm) normal metal lines with subwavelength fea-
tures distributed throughout the active volume (Fig 1a)
in a manner that would collectively enhance the optical
ﬁeld intensity in the vicinity of the metal lines. This
must however be accomplished without signiﬁcantly in-
creasing C and RS. We show that for the proposed struc-
ture (Fig 1) optimized for λ0 = 850 nm, Pf is ∼2800
and 31.8 µW at f = 1 and 5 THz respectively. A con-
venient way to model such a complex structure is to
solve the Maxwell’s equations with appropriate boundary
conditions using Finite Diﬀerence Time-Domain (FDTD)
formulation[22, 23, 27]. A 3D-FDTD simulator with Uni-
axial Perfectly Matched Layer (UPML)[23] surrounding
the photomixer is developed for this purpose. Along the
z-axis, the active volume consists of a few hundred nm of
free space followed by DBR1, absorbing region with com-
plex structure of normal metal electrodes, and pairs of
low/high refractive index layers constituting DBR2 (Fig

The FP cavity is formed by three layers of (TiO2, Si3Nx,
CaF2) constituting DBR1 (refractive indices (2.4, 2.0, 1.23 to
1.36)[25] and thicknesses (100, 150, 190) nm for each layer
respectively), four pairs of (Al2Ox, GaAs) layers[24] forming
DBR2 (refractive indices (1.6, 3.53 − 0.068i) and thicknesses
(130, 60) nm), and D ≈ λ absorbing LT-GaAs layer with
refractive index 3.77 − 0.068i.

ness of DBR layers are ﬁrst optimized by calculating the
reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients of the FP cavity
using matrix methods[25]. The FP cavity is excited by
a linearly polarized, plane wave propagating along +z
direction, with gaussian (elliptic) intensity proﬁle in the
x − y plane. The source plane is placed in the free space
above the DBR1. Frequency-domain Lorentz dispersion
model[26] is adapted for metals with negative dielectric
constant such as W or Pt.

FIG. 3: Carrier transit time distribution ntr(ttr) for electrons
(e) and holes (h) in the photomixer design of Fig 1. The
parameters for red (solid) and blue (dot) curves are same as
in Fig 2 with w = 100 nm where as for grey (dash-dot) curve
only polarization is changed to Ey. For the green (dash) and
cyan (short dash) curves (Lx, p, w) are changed to (7560,
300, 60) and (7480, 320, 120) nm respectively while rest of
the parameters remaining unaltered from those of Fig 2. The
photomixer is excited by an 850 nm source at P0 = 60 mW for
all structures. For clarity, the curves are shifted along y−axis
and the relative shift can be easily obtained from the values
at ttr = 0 fs.

as in Fig 2 whereas for S2 z3 = 645 nm, for S3 z3 = 645 nm
and incident radiation is Ey polarized, for S4 (p, w) are (320,
120) nm respectively, for S5 (Lx, w) are (7560, 60) nm re-
spectively, and for S6 (z1, z3) are (455, 655) nm respectively.
The remaining unlisted parameters are the same in all cases.
In all designs the interdigitated lines in diﬀerent layers have

near ﬁeld enhancement resulting from the thin normal
metal electrodes. In the absence of the W electrodes, we
obtain electric ﬁeld amplitude maxima (maximum am-
plitude 1.4 V/m) corresponding to three antinodes in
the standing wave formed between the DBRs. The 3D
internal dc electric ﬁelds and C are computed by solving
Laplace’s equation with appropriate boundary conditions
using FD techniques[27]. Figure 2b shows the contour
plot of the static electric ﬁeld strength within the LT-
GaAs layer. The data show that unlike the traditional
MSM structure, the ﬁeld strength in this design is well
above the critical ﬁeld (∼5 kV/cm). Moreover, the ﬁeld
strength is ∼90 kV/cm between neighboring electrodes,
in particular at the center of the device where most of the
carriers are generated due to gaussian intensity proﬁle of
the incident laser beams. In the rest of the volume it has
a broad peak at 18 kV/cm (not shown). Results show
that C = 4.90 fF and RS = 2.4 Ω based on the resistivity
of thin annealed or epitaxial W ﬁlms (∼5 µΩ−cm)[28].
The highest electric ﬁeld inside the device is about four
times lower than the breakdown ﬁeld (500 kV/cm); there-
fore device failure due to electric breakdown is unlikely
for this Vb = ±1 V.

Photocurrent ip is calculated by ﬁrst computing the
electron/hole transit time distributions ne
tr(ttr)
shown in Fig 3 for the entire absorbing volume based
on the above FDTD and FD calculations. From the
data available in literature for GaAs and LT-GaAs, for

tr(ttr), nh

ttr ≤ tonset = 100 fs, the carrier motion can be approxi-
mated by ballistic transport with electron eﬀective mass
me = 0.088m0, where m0 is electron rest mass. This
value is consistent with the slope of the linear portion
of transient drift velocity curve obtained from Monte-
Carlo calculations[18]. The corresponding eﬀective mass
for holes is mh = 0.106m0. Eﬀective masses larger than
the accepted values for GaAs (0.063, 0.076 m0 for elec-
tron and light holes respectively) are considered so that
longer ttr, thereby lower estimate of ip results from these
calculations.
In the photomixer of Fig 2, pure ballis-
tic transport is applicable to electrons generated close
to the +ve electrodes and holes generated close to -ve
electrodes. These carriers generated predominantly in
the near ﬁeld enhancement region, transit through non-
uniform dc ﬁelds in the 5 to 90 kV/cm range. It should be
noted that tonset = 100 fs is considerably lower than the
theoretical limit of ballistic motion in GaAs for this ﬁeld
strength range[16]. For ttr ≥ tonset, electron motion is
approximated by qasiballistic transport with time depen-
dent velocity distribution similar to ref. 18 up to ttr = 3
ps, and equilibrium drift velocity (∼ 1 × 107 cm/s) for
ttr > 3 ps. Hole motion is approximated by one third of
the electron velocity at any given ttr ≥ tonset resulting in
velocities lower than those reported for GaAs[17].

The integral of curves in Fig 3 give the carriers (Ne, Nh
for electrons and holes respectively) generated per period
(T ≃ 2.83 fs) of the 850 nm source with P0 = 60 mW.
For the parameters of Fig 2, ∼98% of incident power is

absorbed in LT-GaAs layer while ntr has peaks at ttr ≈
65 and 70 fs for electrons and holes respectively (solid
red and dotted blue curves). Such a sharp peak followed
by several satellite peaks and a long tail of the ntr distri-
bution can be understood from the fact that most of the
carriers are generated close to the electrodes in the near
ﬁeld enhancement regions where the static ﬁelds are also
strong. The satellite peaks result from periodicity of the
electrode structure and speciﬁc choice of the velocity dis-
tribution. As ttr < 1 ps for majority of carriers in Fig 3, τ
is not a critical factor in determining the performance at
THz frequencies. A sharp drop in ntr by a factor of 2 for
electrons and a factor of 3 for holes at ttr ≈ tonset is due
to the lower estimate of carrier velocities for ttr > tonset
resulting from the uniform ﬁeld qasiballistic distribution
function[18] applied to a case where ﬁelds are inherently
inhomogeneous. Although, the above choice of velocity
distribution for quasiballistic motion is consistent with
the fact that over a large volume fraction of the absorb-
ing layer the static ﬁeld is ∼18 kV/cm (not shown), a
rigorous calculation should include quasiballistic velocity
distribution appropriate for inhomogeneous ﬁelds. This
would require ensemble Monte Carlo and carrier trajec-
tory calculations carried out simultaneously. However,
above calculations are adequate for obtaining the lower
limit of the THz power output because a rigorous calcu-
lation would probably produce a more uniform ntr(ttr)
distribution around ttr ≈ tonset without altering the dis-
tribution for ttr < tonset or the integral of ntr(ttr). This
will further reduce the number of carriers in the long tail
of the ntr distribution.

Based on above ntr(ttr) distributions, the number of
electrons captured in the metal electrodes at time t will
be

avl(t) for τ = 4 ps is ∼ 6 × 1015 cm−3 (at P0 = 60 mW)

in diﬀerent layers, and DBR parameters. Fig 4 shows the
Pf values obtained from Eq 1 and 2 for some of the con-
ﬁgurations in the 0.1 to 10 THz range. The data shows
that Pf ∝ f −2.77 in the 0.5 to 6.5 THz range in contrast
to f −4 roll-oﬀ of Pf for a conventional photomixer[14].
A recent nip-nip photomixer concept is shown to have
f −2 roll-oﬀ for f <1.5 THz[12]. Therefore, the design
of Fig 1 exploiting SPPs oﬀers signiﬁcant improvement
over the existing photomixer designs. Based on 3D
FD computation of steady-state heat equation with
appropriate thermal boundary conditions for the device
parameters of Fig 2 (P0 = 60 mW, Vb = ±1 V), internal
temperature (Ti) of the device is estimated to be ∼200
K above the substrate temperature requiring substantial
cooling (to 77 K) when P0 is high. Thermal conductivity
(k) of various DBR layers and that of LT-GaAs are
approximated by assigning kLT−GaAs
= 46 Wm−1K−1
and kLT−GaAs
= 10 Wm−1K−1,
⊥
where kk/k⊥ are in-plane/out-of-plane conductivities.
This internal heating therefore limits P0 to ∼60 mW.
However, the structure of Fig 1b, which is equivalent
to two capacitors in series coupled to the antenna or
transmission line, oﬀers an alternative.
If it is excited
by TEM01 mode lasers with total power P0 = 120 mW
as shown, the output can be increased to 2Pf (of Fig
4) without worsening Ti or n. To demonstrate the
applicability of this method to other semiconductor
materials, similar calculations are carried out for two
more photomixers based on Be doped In1−xGaxAs and
GaN optimized for operation at λ0 = 1550 and 343
nm respectively. Both structures show strong near
ﬁeld enhancement arising from SPPs similar to Fig 2a
and further work is underway to calculate the device
eﬃciencies. Author wishes to thank John Goodkind for
introducing him to the fascinating subject of Auston
switches.

Abstract

It is theoretically shown that storage and time-reversal of light pulses can be achieved in a coupled-

resonator optical waveguide by dynamic tuning of the cavity resonances without maintaining the

translational invariance of the system. The control exploits the Bloch oscillation motion of a light

pulse in presence of a refractive index ramp, and it is therefore rather diﬀerent from the mechanism

of adiabatic band compression and reversal proposed by Yanik and Fan in recent works [M.F. Yanik

and S. Fan, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 083901 (2004); Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 173903 (2004)].

The possibility of dynamically control the resonant properties of microresonator systems

via small refractive index modulation represents a promising and powerful approach for an

all-optical coherent control of light in nanophotonic structures [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Recently, several

theoretical papers have shown that a temporal modulation of the refractive index in pho-

tonic crystals (PCs) and coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) can be exploited

to coherently and reversibly control the spectrum of light, with important applications such

as all-optical storage of light pulses [1, 3], time reversal [2] and wavelength conversion [5, 6].

The existence of a frequency shift on the spectrum of a light pulse reﬂected by a shock-wave

front traveling in a PC was ﬁrst pointed out by Reed et al.

[7, 8], and adiabatic wave-

length conversion by simple dynamic refractive index tuning of a high-Q microcavity in a

PC has been numerically demonstrated in Ref.[5]. In a series of recent papers, Yanik and

Fan showed that an adiabatic and translationally-invariant tuning of the refractive index in

a waveguide-resonator system can be exploited to stop, store and time-reverse light pulses

[1, 2, 3, 9]. The general conditions requested to coherently stop or reverse light pulses have

been stated in Refs.

[4, 9], and the possibility of overcoming the fundamental bandwidth-

delay constraint of static resonator structures has been pointed out. The basic idea of these

previous papers is that the band structure of a translational-invariant waveguide-resonator

system can be dynamically modiﬁed by a proper tuning the refractive index without breaking

the translational invariance of the system. For instance, stopping a light pulse corresponds

to an adiabatic band compression process: an initial state of the system, having a relatively

wide band to accommodate the incoming pulse, adiabatically evolves toward a ﬁnal state

in which the bandwidth shrinks to zero [4]. In practice, the adiabatic evolution is attained

by a slow change of the refractive index of certain cavities forming the photonic structure

[1, 2, 3]. The condition that the dynamic refractive index change does not break the trans-

lational invariance of the system is important because it ensures that: (i) the system can

be described in terms of a band diagram with a dispersion relation ω = ω(k) relating the

frequency ω and the wave vector k of its eigenmodes; (ii) diﬀerent wave vector components

of the pulse are not mixed, so that all the coherent information encoded in the original pulse

are maintained while its spectrum is adiabatically changed [4, 9].

In this work it is shown that a coherent and reversible control of light in a photonic structure

by dynamic refractive index change does not necessarily require to maintain the translational

invariance of the system. We illustrate this by demonstrating the possibility of stopping and

2

time-reversing light pulses in a CROW [10, 11, 12] with a dynamic refractive index gradient.

In this system, light stopping and reversal is not due to adiabatic shrinking and reversal of

the waveguide band structure, as in Refs.[1, 2], but it is a consequence of the coherent Bloch

oscillation (BO) motion of the light pulse induced by the index gradient. It is remarkable

that, thought temporal [13, 14, 15] and spatial [16, 17] BOs and related phenomena have

been studied to a great extent in several linear optical systems, they have been not yet

proposed as an all-optical means to stop or time-reverse light pulses.

We consider a CROW made of a periodic array of identical coupled optical cavities, and

indicate by ωn = ω0 + δωn(t) the resonance frequency of the n-th cavity in the array, where

δωn(t) is a small frequency shift from the common frequency ω0 which can be dynamically

and externally changed by e.g. local refractive index control, as discussed in previous works

[1, 5]. Practical implementations of CROW structures have been demonstrated in photonic

crystals with coupled defect cavities [12, 18] or in a chain of coupled microrings [19]. In

most cases, coupled mode theory [1, 11, 20] can be used to describe the evolution of the

ﬁeld amplitudes an in the cavities and therefore the process of coherent light control; the

results obtained from coupled-mode theory have been shown in fact to be in excellent agree-

ment with full numerical simulations using ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain methods (see, for

instance, [1, 2]). For our system, coupled-mode equations read

i

dan
dt

= −κ(an−1 + an+1) − δωn(t)an

(1)

where κ is the hopping amplitude between two adjacent cavities, which deﬁnes the bandwidth

(4κ) of the CROW. Note that cavity losses are not included in Eqs.(1), however a non-

vanishing loss rate would just introduce a uniform exponential decay in time of an which

would set a maximum limit to the achievable delay time, as discussed in Ref.[1]. As in

Refs.[1, 2, 3, 4], ﬁeld propagation is considered at a classical level; a full quantum treatment,

which would require the introduction of noise sources in Eqs.(1) to account for quantum

noise, is not necessary for the present analysis which deals with passive CROW structures.

Contrary to Refs.

[1, 2], we assume that the modulation of cavity resonances used for

coherent light control is not translational invariant, i.e. δωn depends on n. Precisely, we

assume that a ramp with a time-varying slope α(t) is imposed to the resonances of N

adjacent cavities in the CROW, leading to a site-dependent frequency shift δωn(t) = nα(t)

for 1 ≤ n ≤ N and δωn(t) = 0 for n > N and for n < 1. Note that the dynamic part

3

of the CROW which realizes stopping or time reversal of light is conﬁned in the region

1 < n < N, which is indicated by a rectangular dotted box in Fig.1. The total length of

the system realizing stopping or time reversal of light is therefore L = Nd, where d is the

distance between two adjacent cavities. The modulation α(t) is assumed to vanish for t < t1

and t > t2 [see Fig.1(a)], [t1, t2] being the time interval needed to stop or time-reverse an

incoming pulse. The switch-on time t1 is chosen just after the pulse, propagating along the

CROW and coming from n = −∞, is fully entered in the dynamic part of the CROW,

whereas the length L is chosen long enough to ensure that the pulse remains fully conﬁned

in the cavities 1 < n < N for the whole time interval [t1, t2]. Note that, as for t < t1 and

t > t2 the pulse propagates in the CROW at a constant group velocity, during the time

interval [t1, t2] the pulse motion as ruled by Eqs.(1) is more involved and turns out to be

fully analogous to the motion of a Bloch particle, within a tight-binding model, subjected to

a time-dependent ﬁeld α(t) (see, e.g., [21, 22, 23]). It is indeed such a Bloch motion that can

be properly exploited to stop or time-reverse an incoming pulse. In fact, let us suppose that

the incoming light pulse, propagating in the forward direction of the waveguide and coming

from n = −∞, has a carrier frequency tuned at the middle of the CROW transmission band

and its spectral extension is smaller than the CROW band width 4κ. For t < t1 one can

then write (see the Appendix for technical details)

an(t) =

dQ F (Q) exp(iQn + 2iκt cos Q),

(2)

π

Z

−π

where the spectrum F (Q) is nonvanishing in a small region at around Q = Q0 = π/2.

The shape of F (Q) is determined from the excitation condition of the CROW at n → −∞

or, equivalently, from the ﬁeld distribution an(t0) along the CROW at a given initial time

t = t0 < t1. For instance, assuming without loss of generality t0 = 0, the latter condition

yields for the spectrum F (Q) = 1/(2π)

n an(0) exp(−iQn) (see the Appendix). For t0 <
t < t1, Eq.(2) describes a pulse which propagates along the waveguide with a group velocity

P

vg = 2dκ sin Q0 = 2dκ. At time t = t1, we assume that the pulse is fully entered in the box

system of Fig.1, and the modulation of cavity resonances is then switched on. The exact

solution to Eqs.(1), which is the continuation of Eq.(2) at times t > t1, can be calculated in

a closed form and reads (see the Appendix)

an(t) = exp[iγ(t)n]

dQ F (Q) exp[iQn + iθ(Q, t)],

length L of the system is large enough to entirely contain the pulse in the whole interval

[t1, t2].

In case of pulse storage, after the modulation is switched oﬀ the pulse escapes

from the system in the forward direction with the same group velocity vg = 2dκ as that

of the incoming pulse, but it is delayed by a time ∼ τ [see Fig.1(b)].

In case of time

reversal [Fig.1(c)], the incoming pulse is reﬂected from the system, which thus acts as a

phase-conjugation mirror.

Consider ﬁrst the process of pulse storage. To this aim,

let us assume that the area

γ0 be an integer multiple of 2π. In this case, for t > t2 from Eq.(4) one obtains

phase φ(Q) may introduce a non-negligible pulse distortion. The distortionless condition

φ = 0 is exactly satisﬁed in two important cases: a step-wise modulation α(t) = α0 const

(with α0τ = 2πl, l is an integer), and a sinusoidal modulation α(t) = α0 cos(Ωt), with

τ Ω = 2πl and J0(α0/Ω) = 0. These two cases realize the well-known dc or ac BO motion

[21, 22, 23] of the light pulse in the interval [t1, t2]: pulse storage is therefore due to the

periodic motion of the light pulse which returns to its initial position after each BO (or ac

ﬁeld) period. It is worth commenting more deeply the very diﬀerent mechanisms underlying

light stopping in the translational-invariant system of Ref.[1] with the one considered in the

present work.

In Ref.[1], the modulation of cavity resonances preserves the translational

symmetry and, as a consequence, cross talk between diﬀerent wave vector components of

the pulse is prevented as the waveguide band accomodating the pulse shrinks to zero and

the pulse group velocity adiabatically decreases. Additionally, the tuning process must be

slow enough to ensure reversibility, i.e. to ensure the validity of the adiabatic theorem. In

the present work, the tuning of the cavity resonances breaks the translational symmetry

of the system and the diﬀerent wave vector components Q of the pulse undergo a drift

motion in the reciprocal space according to the well-known ’acceleration theorem’ of a

Bloch particle studied in solid-state physics [22] (see the Appendix for more details). The

motion of Q in the reciprocal space is accompanied by a shift of the pulse carrier frequency,

which spans in a periodic fashion the full band of the waveguide, and by a periodic motion

of the pulse in the ”stopping box” of Fig.1, which is hence trapped inside it [see Fig.2(a)

to be discussed later]. In particular, for a step-wise modulation α(t) which will be mainly

considered in this work [24], the temporal periodicity of the motion is τB = 2π/α0. This

7

is the well-known periodic Bloch motion which is related to the existence for Eqs.(1) of a

discrete Wannier-Stark ladder spectrum instead of a continuous band spectrum (for more

details see, for instance, [22]). Therefore, as in the translational-invariant waveguide system

of Ref.[1] light stopping is achieved by adiabatically shrinking to zero the band of the pulse,

in our system light stopping can be viewed as a trapping eﬀect due to the appearance of

the periodic Bloch motion in the dynamic part of the CROW structure. Note that, as

opposed to the method of Ref.[1], in our case adiabaticity of the tuning process is not

required, however the stopping time τ is quantized since it must be an integer multiple of

the Bloch period τB. Nevertheless, with a suitable choice of the gradient α0 (and hence

of τB), a target delay time τ can be achieved. If τp is the duration of the incoming pulse

to be delayed (with τp < 1/κ), we can estimated the minimum length L of the system as

L = Lp + Lb, where Lp ≃ τpvg = 2dκτp is the spatial extension of the pulse in the waveguide

in the absence of the modulation and Lb ≃ 4κd/α0 is the amplitude of the BO motion.

Hence the minimum number of cavities of the system is given by N = L/d ≃ 2κ(τp + 2/α0).

It should be noted that in practice a sharp step-wise modulation can never be realized,

and a ﬁnite rise time during switch on and oﬀ should be accounted for. Though φ(Q) does

not exactly vanish in this case, dispersive eﬀects can be kept however at a small level. As

an example, Fig.2 shows the process of light storage as obtained by a direct numerical

simulation of Eqs.(1) using a super-Gaussian proﬁle for the gradient α(t). The area γ0 is

chosen to be 6π, so that pulse trapping corresponds to three BO periods, as clearly shown

in the space-time plot of Fig.2(a). Note that the system comprises N = 100 cavities, and

therefore the length L of the waveguide needed to perform light storage is L = Nd = 100d.

The intensity proﬁle of the nearly Gaussian-shaped incoming pulse in the initial cavity

(z = 0) is indicated by the black solid line in Fig.2(c). In the ﬁgure, the intensity proﬁle

of the outcoming pulse at the last cavity of the system (z = 100d) is shown by the red

solid line, whereas the dashed curve indicates the intensity proﬁle of the output pulse at

the last cavity in the absence of index gradient, i.e. when the pulse freely propagates along

the system at the group velocity vg = 2κd. In Figs.2(a) and 2(b), time is normalized to

1/κ, whereas in Fig.2(c) time is normalized to the transit time tpass = L/vg = N/(2κ)

of the pulse in the system. Note that the maximum frequency shift of cavity resonance

needed to achieve the process of pulse storage is δωmax = ±(N/2)α0 ∼ ±5κ. Assuming

that a change δn of the refractive index n produces a change δω ∼ ω0(δn/n) of the cavity

8

resonance ω0, the index ramp of Fig.2(b) thus corresponds to a maximum refractive index

change δn/n ∼ 5κ/ω0. This value is comparable to the one requested for light stopping

by means of adiabatic band compression in the translational-invariant case [1]. To get an

idea of typical values in real physical units, let us assume e.g. a carrier angular frequency
ω0 ≃ 1.216 ×1015 rad/s (corresponding to a wavelength λ ≃ 1.55 µm) and a maximum index
change δn/n ∼ 5 × 10−4, which is comparable to the one used in previous studies (see, e.g.

[1, 5]). The bandwidth 2κ of the waveguide and the transit time tpass in the ﬁgure are then
given by 2κ ∼ 2 × 10−4ω0 ∼ 2.43 × 1011 rad/s (i.e. ∼ 39 GHz) and tpass = N/(2κ) ≃ 410

ps, respectively. For such parameter values, Fig.1 simulates the stopping of a ∼ 68 ps-long

(FWHM) Gaussian pulse with a storage time τ ∼ 1.75 ns.

The process of time-reversal of a light pulse is simply achieved when the area γ0 is

equal to π, apart from integer multiples of 2π. In fact, in this case for t > t2 from Eq.(4)

one obtains

exp[iQn − 2iκ(t − t1 − t2) cos Q],

(6)

A comparison of Eqs.(2) and (6) clearly shows the sign reversal of the frequency 2κ cos Q for

any wave number Q in the integral term, which is the signature of time reversal of the pulse.

Physically, time reversal is due to the fact that, for the π area, the spectrum of the wave

packet in the reciprocal Q space (quasi-momentum) is shifted in the Brillouin zone from

Q0 = π/2 to Q0 = −π/2, thus producing spectral inversion. In addition, since the group

velocity is correspondingly reversed, the pulse is reﬂected by the system and thus propagates

backward. As in the previous case, the process of time reversal does not introduce pulse

distortion provided that φ = 0. For a step-wise modulation, contrary to the 2π area case

φ(Q) does not vanish and one has φ(Q) = −(4κ/α0) sin Q. However, this additional phase

term may be kept small by choosing e.g. a suﬃciently large value of α0, thus minimizing pulse

distortion. An example of time reversal of an asymmetric pulse with minimal distortion, as

obtained by a direct numerical simulation of Eqs.(1) using a super-Gaussian proﬁle for the

gradient α(t), is shown in Fig.3. Note that in this case the pulse undergoes a semi-integer

number of BO periods.

In conclusion, it has been theoretically shown that storage and time-reversal of light can be

9

realized by exploiting BOs in a dynamic coupled-resonator waveguide. The proposed scheme

is rather distinct from the adiabatic band compression technique recently proposed in Refs.

[1, 2], and provides a noteworthy example of coherent light control in a system with broken

translational invariance.

In this Appendix we provide a detailed derivation of the solution to the coupled-mode

equations (1) at times t < t1, t1 < t < t2 and t > t2 presented in the text [Eqs.(2), (3)

and (4)]. To this aim, we follow a rather standard technique (see, for instance, [21]) and

introduce the time-varying Fourier spectrum G(Q, t) deﬁned by the relation

G(Q, t) =

an(t) exp(−iQn).

(A1)

The amplitudes an(t) can be derived from the spectrum G(Q, t) after inversion according to

the relation

an(t) =

dQ G(Q, t) exp(iQn).

(A2)

Using the coupled-mode equations (1) with δωn(t) = α(t)n, the following diﬀerential equa-

tion for the spectrum G can be easily derived [25]

(A3)

For t < t1, we have α(t) = 0, and therefore the solution to Eq.(A3) is simply given by

G(Q, t) = F (Q) exp(2iκt cos Q) (t < t1),

(A4)

where the proﬁle F (Q) is determined by the spectrum G at an initial time t = t0 by means

of Eq.(A1) once the ﬁeld distribution an(t0) is assigned. Note that substitution of Eq.(A4)

into Eq.(A2) yields Eq.(2) given in the text.

For t > t1, α(t) is nonvanishing and the solution to Eq.(A3), which is a continuation of

Eq.(A4) for times t > t1, can be easily obtained after the change of variables η = t and

ξ = Q − γ(t), where we have set

γ(t) =

(A6)

which can be easily integrated with the initial condition G(ξ, η = t1) = F (ξ) exp(2iκt1 cos ξ).

Upon re-introducing the old variables Q and t, one then obtains

Substituting Eq.(A7) into Eq.(A2), after the change of integration variable Q′ = Q−γ(t) and

taking into account the 2π-periodicity of the spectrum G(Q, t) with respect to the variable
Q, one then readily obtains Eq.(3) given in text. Note that |G(Q, t)|2 = |F (Q − γ(t))|2, i.e.

the role of the gradient α(t) is to induce a rigid drift of the initial spectrum, a result which

is known as ”acceleration theorem” in the solid-state physics context [22]. In particular, for

a constant gradient α(t) = α0, the drift of the spectrum is uniform in time. In this case,

from Eq.(A5) it follows that, after a time τB = 2π/α0 from the initial time t = t1, one has

γ(t1 +τB) = 2π and, from Eq.(A7), G(Q, t1 +τB) = G(Q, t1), i.e. the initial ﬁeld distribution

in the CROW structure is retrieved: τB plays the role of the BO period which is determined

by the gradient α0.

For t > t2, one has α(t) = 0 and the spectrum G(Q, t) is still given by Eq.(A7), where
t1 dt′α(t′) ≡ γ0 for t > t2. Note that for t > t2

according to Eq.(A5) one has γ(t) =

t2

Eq.(A7) can be cast in the following form

R

G(Q, t) = G(Q, t2) exp[2iκ(t − t2) cos Q] (t > t2)

(A8)

Substitution of Eq.(A8) into Eq.(A2), with G(Q, t2) given by Eq.(A7) with t = t2, and after
the change of variable Q′ = Q − γ0 in the integral of Eq.(A2), one ﬁnally obtains Eq.(4)

given in the text for the solution at times t > t2.

[24] For a sinusoidal modulation, Eqs.(1) admit of a quasi-energy band and the condition

J0(α0/Ω) = 0 corresponds to the collapse of the quasi-energy band [M. Holthaus, Phys. Rev.

Lett. 69, 351 (1992)]. More generally, for a fast sinusoidal modulation α(t) = α0(t) sin(Ωt)

of frequency Ω much larger than κ and amplitude α0 which is slowly-varying in time, by a

12

multiple scale analysis one can remove the rapidly-varying terms in Eqs.(1) and obtain the

reduced equations idan/dt = −κe(t)(an+1 + an−1) with an eﬀective slowly-varying hopping

amplitude κe = κJ0(α0/Ω) [see, e.g., S. Longhi, Phys. Rev. B 73, 193305 (2006)]. A slow

change of α0 leads to an adiabatic change of the bandwidth of the waveguide. Light slowing

down and stopping in this case is thus analogous to adiabatic band compression of Ref.[1].

The requested modulation frequency Ω, however, turns out to be too high (larger than κ) to

be reasonably achieved in practice.

[25] In deriving Eq.(A3) we assumed that the relation ωn = nα(t) holds even for n < 1 and n > N ,

though in practice the dynamic tuning of cavity resonances is applied solely for the cavities

with index n in the range 1 < n < N (see Fig.1). However, taking into account that α(t)

vanishes outside the interval [t1, t2] and that the size N of the stopping box is large enough to

fully contain the pulse during the delay interval, i.e. an(t) ≃ 0 for n < 1, n > N in the time

interval t1 < t < t2, the previous assumption does not change the solution of the problem.

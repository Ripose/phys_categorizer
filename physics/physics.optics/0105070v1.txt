Doppler-Induced Dynamics of Fields in Fabry-Perot Cavities with
Suspended Mirrors1

Malik Rakhmanov

Physics Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611

Abstract

The Doppler eﬀect in Fabry-Perot cavities with suspended mirrors is analyzed.

Intrinsically small, the Doppler
shift accumulates in the cavity and becomes comparable to or greater than the line-width of the cavity if its ﬁnesse is
high or its length is large. As a result, damped oscillations of the cavity ﬁeld occur when one of the mirrors passes a
resonance position. A formula for this transient is derived. It is shown that the frequency of the oscillations is equal
to the accumulated Doppler shift and the relaxation time of the oscillations is equal to the storage time of the cavity.
Comparison of the predicted and the measured Doppler shift is discussed, and application of the analytical solution for
measurement of the mirror velocity is described.

Introduction

Fabry-Perot cavities with the length of several kilometers
are utilized in laser gravitational wave detectors such as
LIGO [1]. The mirrors in these Fabry-Perot cavities are
suspended from wires and therefore are free to move along
the direction of beam propagation. Ambient seismic mo-
tion excites the mirrors, causing them to swing like pendu-
lums with frequencies of about one hertz and amplitudes of
several microns. To maintain the cavity on resonance the
Pound-Drever locking technique [2] is used. During lock
acquisition the mirrors frequently pass through resonances
of the cavity. As one of the mirrors approaches a resonant
position the light in the cavity builds up. Immediately af-
ter the mirror passes a resonance position, a ﬁeld transient
in the form of damped oscillations occurs. This transient
depends mostly on the cavity length, its ﬁnesse, and the
relative velocity of the mirrors. Thus, careful examination
of the transient reveals useful information about the cavity
properties and the mirror motion.

[4].

The oscillatory transient was observed in the past in
several experiments with high-ﬁnesse Fabry-Perot cavities.
The oscillations were recorded in the intensity of reﬂected
light by Robertson et al. [3]. In this experiment the oscil-
lations were used for measurements of the storage time of
a Fabry-Perot cavity and its ﬁnesse. The oscillations were
also observed in the intensity of transmitted light by An et
al.
In this experiment the oscillations were used for
measurements of the cavity ﬁnesse and the mirror velocity.
The transient was also studied by Camp et al. [5] for appli-
cations to cavity lock acquisition. This time the oscillations
were observed in the Pound-Drever locking signal. Recently
the transient has been revisited by Lawrence et al. [6]. In
this study both the cavity length scans and the frequency
scans were analyzed using all three signals: the intensities
of the reﬂected and transmitted ﬁelds as well as the Pound-
Drever signal.

Although the transient has been frequently observed in
experiments, its theory is far from being complete.
It is
known that the oscillations in the transient appear through
the beatings of diﬀerent ﬁeld components in the cavity.
However, diﬀerent authors propose slightly diﬀerent beat
mechanisms [4, 6]. Moreover, it is not understood why the
rate of the oscillations always increases in time, and what
causes this chirp-like behavior.

In this paper we show that the transient can be explained
by the Doppler eﬀect which appears in a Fabry-Perot cavity
with moving mirrors. Intrinsically small, the Doppler shift
is ampliﬁed by the cavity and results in the modulation of

the intracavity ﬁeld. Based on this observation, we derive
a simple formula for the transient and explain its chirp-like
behavior. In this approach the frequency of the oscillations
can be easily found from the cavity parameters and the
mirror velocity. The predictions based on the formula and
numerical simulations are compared with the measurements
taken with the 40m Fabry-Perot cavity of the Caltech pro-
totype interferometer. In both cases good agreements are
found.

Currently the transient is studied in connection with lock-
ing of the kilometer-sized Fabry-Perot cavities of LIGO
interferometers [7]. The analysis presented in this paper
serves as a basis for calculations of the cavity parameters in
these studies.

1 Reﬂection of Light oﬀ a Moving

Mirror

To set grounds for the analysis in this paper, consider a sim-
ple process of reﬂection of light (electromagnetic wave) oﬀ
a moving mirror. Let the mirror be moving along the x-axis
with an arbitrary trajectory X(t). Assume that the light is
propagating along the positive x-direction and is normally
incident on the mirror. The wave-front of the reﬂected wave
observed at the location x and time t is reﬂected by the
mirror at some earlier time t′ which, according to Fig. 1,
satisﬁes the equation:

For simplicity we assumed that the mirror is perfect (100%

of the waves at the mirror surface, and leads to two closely
related eﬀects. On one hand, it gives rise to the phase shift
of the reﬂected wave which appears because the mirror po-
sition is changing. On the other hand, it gives rise to the
frequency shift of the reﬂected wave which appears because
the mirror is moving. Indeed, the frequency of the reﬂected
wave can be found as

The two amplitudes, E1(t) and E2(t), which correspond to
the same wave but deﬁned at diﬀerent locations, x and x′,

Fabry-Perot cavities of laser gravitational-wave detectors
are very long and have mirrors that can move. The Doppler
shift in such cavities can be described as follows. Let the
cavity length be L and the light transit time be T :

At any given location the electric ﬁeld oscillates at a very

Subsequent reﬂections make this frequency shift add, form-
ing the progression:

(17)

Therefore, the Doppler shift of light in the cavity accumu-
lates with time.

A suspended mirror in such cavities moves very little. Its
largest velocity is typically of the order of a few microns
per second. The corresponding Doppler shift is of the order
of a few hertz, which is very small compared to the laser
1014 Hz for an infra-red laser with wave-
frequency 2.82
length λ = 1.06µm. However, the line-width of the long
Fabry-Perot cavities of the laser gravitational wave detec-
tors is also very small, typically of the order of 100 Hz.
Therefore, the small Doppler shift, as it accumulates with
time, can easily exceed the line-width.

×

The characteristic time for light to remain in the cavity is
the storage time, which is deﬁned as 1/e-amplitude folding
time:

in the cavity. The equation for the dynamics of this ﬁeld
can be derived as follows. Assume, for simplicity, that one
of the mirrors (input mirror) is at rest and the other (end
mirror) is freely swinging. Let the trajectory of this mirror
be X(t). It is convenient to separate the constant and the
variable parts of the mirror trajectory:

X(t) = L + x(t).

(22)

In Fabry-Perot cavities of gravitational wave detectors L is
of the order of a few kilometers and x is of the order of
a few microns. Without loss of generality we can assume
that the cavity length L is equal to an integer number of
wavelengths and therefore e−2ikL = 1.

Note that the mirror moving with the critical velocity passes

qualitative arguments show that the Doppler eﬀect becomes
signiﬁcant if the time for a mirror to move across the width
of a resonance is comparable to or less than the storage time
of the cavity.

Let the amplitude of the input laser ﬁeld be Ein(t) and the
amplitudes of the ﬁelds inside the cavity be E(t) and E′(t),
both deﬁned at the reﬂective surface of the input mirror as
shown in Fig. 2. Then the equation for reﬂection oﬀ the end

3 Transient due to Mirror Motion

The mirrors in Fabry-Perot cavities of laser gravitational
wave detectors are suspended from wires and can swing like
pendulums with frequencies of about 1 Hz. The amplitude
of such motion is of the order of a few microns. During
the swinging motion, the mirrors frequently pass through
resonances of the cavity. Each passage through a resonance
gives rise to the ﬁeld transient in the form of damped oscil-
lations. Such a transient can be described in terms of the
complex amplitude of the cavity ﬁeld as follows. For the
entire time when the mirror moves through the width of a
resonance (a few milliseconds), its velocity can be consid-
ered constant, and its trajectory can be approximated as
linear: x = vt. Often the amplitude of the incident ﬁeld is
constant: Ein(t) = A. Then amplitude of the intracavity
ﬁeld satisﬁes the equation:

which is a special case of equation (27).

Numerical solutions of this equation can be easily ob-
tained on the computer. Examples of the numerical solu-
tion with the parameters of LIGO 4km Fabry-Perot cavities
are shown in Fig. 3.

Such numerical solutions provide an accurate description
for the ﬁeld transient but give little insight into the physics
of the process. Therefore, it is worthwhile to obtain an
approximate analytical solution for this equation.

cavity. At the time when the mirror passes the center of
the resonance, a substantial amount of light accumulates in
the cavity. From this moment on, the light stored in the
cavity (D-component) decays according to the exponential
law, and its frequency is continuously shifting due to the
Doppler eﬀect. At the same time there is a constant in-
ﬂux of the new light from the laser (C-component). The
new light is not aﬀected by the Doppler shift and therefore
evolves according to the usual adiabatic law.

(40)

Thus the transient, which occurs during a passage of the
mirror through a resonance, is caused by the Doppler ef-
fect ampliﬁed by the cavity. The frequency of oscillations
linearly increases in time with the rate proportional to the
mirror velocity.

Comparison of the approximate analytical solution given
by Eq. (40) with the numerical simulations based on
Eq. (28) shows that the two solutions agree very well in
the region past the resonance (t
T ). However, the two
solutions diﬀer substantially in the region near the center of
0). This is because the center of the res-
the resonance (t
onance is the boundary of the validity of the approximate
analytical solution.

The above analysis leads to the following explanation of
the oscillatory transient. As the mirror approaches the res-
onance position (x = 0), the light is rapidly building in the

3.2 Observation of the Transient via Beats

The small frequency shifts of the light circulating in the cav-
ity are usually observed through beats. There are several
beat mechanisms which take place in Fabry-Perot cavities
with moving mirrors. Here we describe the three most fre-
quently occurred beat mechanisms in detail.

The Doppler-induced oscillations of the intracavity ﬁeld
can be observed in the intensity of the transmitted ﬁeld.
The above analysis shows that the Doppler eﬀect gives rise
to phase modulation of D-ﬁeld. As a result, the cavity ﬁeld
E, which is the sum of D and C ﬁelds, becomes amplitude
modulated. This amplitude modulation can be observed as
the intensity modulation of the ﬁeld transmitted through
the cavity. According to Eqs. (25) and (29) the intensity of
the transmitted ﬁeld is proportional to

The second term in the right hand side of this equation rep-
resents the amplitude modulation of the intracavity ﬁeld as
described in Eq. (41). The last term represents a beating
of the intracavity ﬁeld transmitted through the front mirror
and the input laser ﬁeld promptly reﬂected by the front mir-
ror. Both terms give rise to the oscillations in the intensity
of the reﬂected ﬁeld. Therefore the decay of the reﬂected in-
tensity is described by the double exponential function with
two decay times, τ and τ /2, as was noticed by Robertson
et al. [3].

The oscillations can also be observed in the Pound-Drever
signal, which requires optical sidebands be imposed on the
light incident on the cavity. In this case the signal is ob-
tained from beating of the carrier reﬂected ﬁeld with the
sideband reﬂected ﬁelds. Since the carrier ﬁeld propagates
in the cavity, it becomes Doppler-shifted due to the motion
of the cavity mirrors. The sideband ﬁelds are promptly re-
ﬂected by the front mirror of the cavity. Therefore their
amplitudes are proportional to the amplitude of the inci-
dent carrier ﬁeld. Then the signal can be approximated by
the formula:

V (t) =

Im
{

∗
eiγEin(t)

,

(45)

where γ is the phase of a local oscillator in the optical het-
erodyne detection.

If the amplitude of the input laser ﬁeld is constant
(Ein(t) = A) then the Pound-Drever signal becomes a linear
function of the cavity ﬁeld:

V (t) =

{
Since C-component is a monotonic function, the oscillations
come from D-component only. Unlike the signals derived
from the intensity of the transmitted or reﬂected ﬁelds, the
Pound-Drever signal is linearly proportional to the ampli-
tude of the intracavity ﬁeld and therefore presents a direct
way to observe the oscillations.

The formula for the transient, Eq. (40), can be used for
extracting the cavity parameters from the Pound-Drever
signal. In such an analysis it is convenient to remove the
adiabatic component from the Pound-Drever signal. The
result is the function very similar to D(t), which is given by

Here we introduced t0, the time when the mirror passes
a center of the resonance, and δ = arg D0. The mea-
sured Pound-Drever signal (with the adiabatic component
removed) and the theoretical prediction based on this for-
mula are shown in Fig. 5 (upper plot).

4.1 Measurement of the Cavity Finesse

The oscillatory transient can be used for measurements of
the cavity ﬁnesse. The present approach is based on the
exponential decay of the Pound-Drever signal. The ﬁnesse
can be found by studying the absolute value of the adjusted
Pound-Drever signal:

Indeed, by ﬁtting the exponential function to the envelope

Applied to the data shown in Fig. 4, this method yields the
following value for the ﬁnesse of the Caltech 40m Fabry-
Perot cavity:

This result is close to the one previously obtained from the
1050). The
measurement of the mirror reﬂectivities (
present approach to measure the cavity storage time is sim-
ilar to the one described by Robertson et al [3].

4.2 Measurement of the Mirror Velocity

The oscillatory transient can also be used for measurements
of the mirror velocity. The present approach is based on the
linear shift of the frequency of the Pound-Drever signal. The
velocity can be found by studying either the peaks or the
zero crossing of the adjusted Pound-Drever signal, VD(t).

Let the times for the zero crossings be tn, where n is
integer. The values for tn are deﬁned by the functional
form of the adjusted Pound-Drever signal, Eq. (48), and
are given by

kv
2T

(tn −

t0)2 = πn + γ + δ.

(52)

This relation depends on the demodulation phase γ, which
is not always known in the experiment. However, the dif-
ference:

the zero crossings, ∆tn, and the positions of their midpoints,
¯tn, as follows:

Then the “average” frequency of the oscillations of VD(t),
can be deﬁned as

(49)

Using the identity, Eq. (53), we can show that the average
frequencies satisfy the equation:

This equation is a discrete analog of the continuous evolu-
tion, Eq. (38).

If the times tn correspond to the peaks and not the zero
crossings of the signal, the predicted average frequency be-
comes

¯νn =

t0) + δ¯νn,

(¯tn −
where δ¯νn is a small correction which accounts for the ex-
ponential decay of the signal present in Eq. (48). The cor-
rection can be found from Eq. (48) using a perturbation
expansion in powers of T /τ . In the lowest order, it is given
by

(59)

Such a correction becomes signiﬁcant only if the oscillations
are close to being critically damped.

In general the zero crossings can be aﬀected by the sub-
traction of the adiabatic component. Therefore, we prefer to
use the peaks of the signal. The peak-positions tn are found
from the measured Pound-Drever signal, which is shown in
Fig. 5 (upper plot). Since the oscillations are far from be-
ing critically damped,the correction δ¯νn can be neglected.
In this experiment, the ﬁrst order correction is much less
than the error in determination of the average frequencies.
As a result the measured values of the average frequencies
νn appear very close to the linear function, Eq. (57). This
can also be seen in Fig. 5 (lower plot). Therefore, we can
apply a linear ﬁt to the data:

¯ν(t) = at + b,

does not depend on the demodulation phase and therefore is
more suitable for this analysis. Deﬁne the spacings between

where a and b are the slope and the intercept of the linear

accurate measurements of the cavity ﬁnesse and the mirror
velocities. Implemented in real-time computer simulations
the formula for the transient can be used in lock acquisition
algorithms.

The analysis presented in this paper explains the chirp-
like behavior of the transient and leads to a simple formula
for its frequency. However, the approximate analytical solu-
tion given in this paper describes only the ringdown part of
the transient. The buildup part is yet to be explained. Also
it is not clear at the present time why oscillations always
appear after the mirror passes the center of the resonance
and not before.

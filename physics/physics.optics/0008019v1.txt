Abstract. New feasibity of coherent quantum control of four-wave mixing processes
in a resonant Doppler-broadened medium are studied. We propose a technique which
enables one to enhance the quantum eﬃciency of nonlinear optical conversion. At the
same time, it allows one to decrease the required intensities of the fundamental beams
compared to those necessary in the approach based on coherent population trapping.
The major outcomes of the analysis are illustrated with numerical simulation addressed
within a practical medium.

1 Introduction

The concept of quantum coherence and interference plays an important role in
resonant nonlinear optics and spectroscopy [1]. Coherent coupling of laser radia-
tion with multilevel quantum schemes has been used to manipulate energy level
populations, nonlinear-optical response, refraction and absorption of a resonance
medium [2]. Much attention has been shown to four-wave mixing (FWM) pro-
cesses with maximal coherence on a Raman transition [3] based on the eﬀect of
coherence population trapping (CPT) [4], which allows a dramatic increase of
conversion eﬃciency. In far-from-degenerate schemes, substantial Doppler broad-
ening of the resonant quantum transitions gives rise to inhomogeneous coupling
of the driving ﬁelds with the atoms in diﬀerent velocity intervals. Therefore,
under relatively low intensities, only a small fraction of the atoms can be con-
currently coupled with both the ﬁelds driving the Raman transition and, as a

consequence, the CPT conditions can not be fulﬁlled for the entire thermal ve-
locity interval. This fundamental limitation in resonant nonlinear optics of gases
substantially reduces the eﬃciency of the corresponding processes. The common
methods of Doppler-free (DF) nonlinear spectroscopy entail ladder energy level
schemes and equal frequency counter-propagating beams. This usually leads to
large detunings from the intermediate resonance and consequently a decrease
of the nonlinear susceptibility. Besides that, the method can not be applied to
FWM processes in ladder schemes, due to the phase-matching requirements, and
in Raman-type schemes due to the diﬀerence in frequencies of the coupled ﬁelds.
The technique, allowing one to overcome this obstacle by compensating for
Doppler frequency shifts with light-induced ac-Stark shifts and thus enabling
one to couple a wide velocity interval concurrently, has been proposed in [5].
This was developed in further publications [6] and most recently in publications
[7] addressing FWM under conditions where CPT is not possible. Related eﬀects
in the absorption index were also investigated recently [8].

We further mean CPT as the process where two driving ﬁelds form nearly
equal velocity-averaged populations of the levels at Raman transitions, while the
velocity-averaged population of the intermediate state is much less. Along with
this absorption and ampliﬁcation indices for the couple ﬁelds reach minimum.
On the other hand coherence in the Raman transition, which is origin of FWM,
approaches maximum. That allows one to accomplish a maximum of the con-
version eﬃciency. The conditions to achieve CPT may diﬀer from those required
for the DF Raman-type resonance. This present paper is aimed at investigating
what are the most favorable conditions to accomplish eﬀective FWM frequency
conversion of radiation at a low fundamental radiation level. This also addresses
the problem “nonlinear optics at the level a few photons per atom” [9].

Consider a Raman-type scheme of

Fig. 1, where E1 and E2 with frequen-
cies ω1 and ω2 are traveling waves of
the driving ﬁelds. The ﬁeld E3 with
the frequency ω3 and generated radi-
ation ES with the frequency ωS are
assumed weak (i.e., not changing the
level populations). All waves are co-
propagated. Initially, only the lower
level 0 is populated. The steady-state
solution for the oﬀ-diagonal elements
of the density matrix (atomic coher-
ence) can be found in the same form of traveling waves as the the resonant
driving radiations. Then the equations for the density matrix amplitudes to the

Here rij and ri are the amplitudes of the oﬀ-diagonal and diagonal elements of
the density matrix, Pij = Γij + i(Ωl − klv), Ωl is the resonance detuning for the
corresponding resonant ﬁeld (e.g., Ω1 = ω1 − ω01), Γij are homogeneous half-
widths of the transitions (coherence relaxation rates), v is the projection of the
atom velocity on the direction of the wave vectors kl, γ1,2 are relaxation rates
from level 1 to 0 and from 1 to 2 , accordingly, Γ1, Γ2 are relaxation rates of the
populations of the levels 1 and 2 accordingly, Gij = −Ejdij/2¯h are the Rabi
frequencies, and dij are the electric dipole momenta of the transitions. Only the
resonant couplings are accounted for.

2.2 Coherence-induced Doppler-free resonance

The appearance of a DF resonance and therefore the coupling of molecules
from a wide velocity interval can be understood as follows. Ac-Stark shifts

Im (cid:8)|G01|2/P ∗

21(cid:9) and Im (cid:8)|G12|2/P01(cid:9) in (4), originating from the coherence

r02, depend on the radiation intensity and frequency detunings. The later ones,
in turn, depend on Doppler shifts. This allows one, by making judicious choice
of the intensities and detunings of the driving ﬁelds, to “draw” into the dressed
two-photon resonance all the molecules, independent of their velocities. In the
limiting case, when the detuning from the intermediate resonance is much greater
than the Doppler HWHM of the allowed optical transitions, the modiﬁed two-
photon resonance described by the denominator ˜P02 can be presented in the
lowest order in k1,2v/Ω1,2 as

The conditions for the CPT and DF resonances may ﬁt each other or diﬀer, de-
pending on the speciﬁc case. This and corresponding outcomes regarding FWM
will be investigated below numerically for the most optimum situations, where
the analytical solution can not be obtained.

3 Numerical analysis

The graphs presented below are computed numerically based on averages over
the velocity equations (5), (6) and (7). For the numerical analysis we have used
the parameters of the sodium dimer transition with the following wavelengths
[10]: X 1Σ +
g (13, 43)
(λ21 = 525 nm) – A1Σ +
g (3, 43)(λ13 = 598 nm).
The corresponding homogeneous half-widths of the transition are 20.69, 23.08,
18.30 and 15.92 MHz, whereas the Doppler half-widths ∆ωiD are equal to 0.92,
0.85, 0.68 and 0.75 GHz. The numerical simulations allow us to analyze the
velocity-averaged equation for the detunings, where the approximation taken in
(8) is not valid.

Fig. 2. Normalized squared module of the FWM polarizations ˜P4 (a) and ˜P3 (b)

– CPT, 3 – intermediate case, subplot – same resonance, but under weak ﬁelds.

G01/∆ω1D, g12 = G12/∆ω2D. A substantial narrowing is seen from comparison
with the subplot, presenting the spectral dependence of the velocity-averaged
squared module of the same susceptibility, but in the negligibly weak ﬁelds, nor-
malized to unity. The HWHM of the resonance in the subplot is approximately
70 MHz, which corresponds to the Doppler width of the nonperturbated Raman
transition, whereas the HWHM of the resonance in plots 1 is 15 MHz. This
indicates some power and residual Doppler broadening. The Rabi frequencies
of the ﬁelds E1 and E2 are equal to 157 MHz and 85 MHz. The detuning of
E1 is equal to 413.8 MHz (0.45 · ∆ω1D), and detuning of E3 is equal to -695.5
MHz (−1.02 · ∆ω3D). Plots 2 display the same dependences, but related to the
CPT conditions (the half-width of this resonance in | ˜P4|2 is 200 MHz). In this
case, the required Rabi frequencies of E1 and E2 are equal to 351 MHz and 332
MHz, respectively, while the detunings are identical to those in plots 1. Plots 3
display the same dependence, but under the intensities, that provide narrowing
in the intermediate range (HWHM of resonance is 70 MHz). In this case, the
Rabi frequencies of the ﬁelds E1 and E2 are equal to 222 MHz and 235 MHz,
respectively, whereas the detunings are the same as in the previous plots. The
important outcome is that in the Doppler-free regime, larger FWM polariza-
tions can be accomplished under lower driving ﬁelds. Also, we want to stress
the substantial diﬀerence in magnitudes of the nonlinear susceptibilities χ4 and
χ3, which follows from the interference of contributions of molecules in diﬀerent
velocity intervals to the macroscopic nonlinear polarizations. Figure 3(a) shows
dependence of the velocity integrated populations on the detuning of the ﬁeld
E2, while the Rabi frequencies of E1 and E2 are equal to 351 MHz and 332 MHz,
respectively so that the CPT conditions can be fulﬁlled under appropriate de-
tuning. The subplot displays the distribution of the populations over velocities,
whereas the detuning corresponds to the CPT regime for the velocity-integrated
populations. Here u is the thermal velocity with Maxwell envelope removed.
The subplot indicates CPT for molecules in v = 0; however, even inversion of
the populations occurs in a relatively wide velocity intervals.

Figure 3(b) is computed for the Rabi frequencies of the ﬁelds E1 and E2

above. The graph 4 (a) shows a substantially decreased absorption index for the
ﬁrst ﬁeld due to saturation eﬀects, which is almost independent of the detuning
of the second ﬁeld because of its relative weakness. The second ﬁeld experiences
Stokes gain. The plot for the generated beam (reduced by 10) displays a nonlinear
resonance in the absorption index. With growth of the second ﬁeld intensity, so
that CPT becomes possible, both absorption of the ﬁrst and gain of the second
driving ﬁeld experience substantial decrease in the CPT regime. Absorption of
the generated ﬁeld dramatically changes as well (Figure 4 (a)).

A linear approximation in k1,2v/Ω1,2 (see equation (8)) is valid for large de-
tunings from the intermediate resonance. While for tuning close to the resonance,

the concurrently coupled velocity interval decreases, the nonlinear response of
the molecules grows. At the same time, absorption of the coupled radiations
increases as well.

The output FWM generated radiation is determined by the interplay of the
above considered processes. Moreover, resonant FWM may not be viewed as
a sequence of the independent elementary acts of absorption, gain and FWM.
Interference of these elementary processes plays a crucial role, even for a quali-
tative prediction of the spatial dynamics of the generated ﬁeld [11]. Therefore,
appropriate optimization is required in order to achieve the maximum FWM-
generation output. In the next section, relevant results are presented based on
the above analyzed dependencies.

3.2 Coherent quantum control of FWM in a double-Λ Doppler

The solution of the Maxwell equations for the coupled traveling waves can be

El(z = 0) = E0l (l = 1, 2, 3) and ES(z = 0) = 0. We assume that intensities of
the weak waves with frequencies ω3 and ωS are weak enough so that the change
of the strong ﬁelds E1,2 due to FWM conversion can be neglected. The quantum
eﬃciency of conversion QEC of the radiation E3 in ES is deﬁned by the equation

These formulas account for nonlinear resonances both in FWM nonlinear polar-
izations and in absorption indices. In order to compute the absolute magnitude
of QEC (under the assumption of ∆k′ = 0) we have used the data for the Frank-
Condon factors of 0.068, 0.142, 0.02 and 0.036 for the transition with wavelengths
λ01, λ21, λ23 and λ03 accordingly.

Figure 5 presents a numerical simulation of the evolution of QEC along the
vapor cell. The distance is scaled to the resonance optical density α01z with
the driving ﬁelds being turned oﬀ. The plot 1 corresponds to the case where
the conditions for Doppler compensation at the transition 0–2 are fulﬁlled on
the entrance of the cell. The Doppler-free resonance would be narrower if one
of the coupled ﬁelds were weak. However, that would give rise to larger absorp-
tion and to decreased nonlinear FWM polarization. The optimization accounting
for the change of the driving ﬁelds along the medium also shows that it does
not substantially change the optimum input intensity values for the plots pre-
sented in Fig. 5. Plot 2 displays the same dependence, but for the optimum CPT
conditions. Alternatively, they are not optimum for the elimination of Doppler
broadening.
The maxima of these two curves are
comparable, but in the Doppler- free
regime, quite lower intensities of the
fundamental radiations are required.
Plot 3 displays a similar dependence
in the intermediate case. All inten-
sities and detunings are identical to
those used for computing the previ-
ous ﬁgures.

For the transitions under consid-
eration, the Rabi frequency on the
level of 100 MHz corresponds to pow-
ers of about 100 mW focused on
a spot on the order of 10−4 cm2,
which can be realized with common
cw lasers with the confocal parame-
ter of focusing of about 2.5 cm. At a temperature of about 700 K, the optimum
optical density of the dimers is achievable for vapor lengths of about 2 cm. This
is in accord with the parameters of typical cw FWM experiments (see, e.g. [10]).
The above indicated intensity corresponds to about 1011 photons per cubic
centimeter. Accounting for the molecule number density at the indicated temper-
ature, which is on the order on 1013 cm−3, we have about 10−2 photon/molecule.

4 Conclusion

Coherent control of populations [12] and of four-wave mixing [13] with pulses
shorter than the dephasing time T2 has proven to be a powerful tool for manip-
ulating nonlinear-optical and chemical properties of free atoms and molecules.
In these cases, maximum coherence can be achieved as a result of Rabi oscilla-
tions of the two-photon transition, and the required driving intensity is much

higher than that proposed in this paper. Consequently, Doppler broadening of
the coupled transitions does not play an important role.

On the contrary, this paper considers coherent quantum control of resonant
four-wave mixing processes, where Doppler-broadening of a double-Λ medium
is the factor of crucial importance. An approach enabling one to enhance the
eﬃciency of nonlinear optical conversion and, at the same time, to decrease the
required intensity for the fundamental pump beams is proposed. This approach
is based on the elimination of Doppler broadening of the resonant two-photon
transition. The advantages of the proposed method as compared to those based
on coherent population trapping, where inhomogeneous broadening may play
important role too, are illustrated with numerical simulations for realistic exper-
imental schemes. The results obtained contribute to the ﬁeld of nonlinear optics
at the level of several photons per atom, which is currently attracting growing
interest.

Abstract

The dielectric property (2

2) of the anisotropic optical medium is
found out considering the polarized photon as two component spinor of
spherical harmonics.The Geometric Phase of single polarized photon has
been evaluated in two ways. The phase two-form of the dielectric matrix
through a twist and the Pancharatnam phase(GP)through the change of
angular momentum of the incident polarized photon over a closed trian-
gular path on the extended Poincare sphere.The helicity in connection
with the spin angular momentum of the chiral photon plays the key role
in developing these phase holonomies.

Introduction

The idea of geometric phase was ﬁrst pointed out theoretically in 1941’s
by Vladimirski[1]in connection with curved nonplaner light beam for its
rotation of plane of polarization in an inhomogenous medium.In 1956
Pancharatnam showed similar phase[2] in his strikingly original work on
interference of polarized light by the cyclic change of state over a closed
path on the Poincare sphere. The similarity of the above work with Berry
[3] was pointed out by Ramseshan et.al[4].This leads Berry to study the
Geometric Phase(GP) of linearly polarized light from quantum mechani-
cal point of view[5].Twisting the anisotropic medium over a closed path,
Berry also[6] studied the phase two-form(GP)in connection with the di-
electric tensor and bierfringence of the medium.The geometric phase in
the context of polarization optics have been studied from the view-point
of group theoretical aspects by Simon and Mukunda [7] and Bhandari[8].
The physical mechanism for GP in Optics has been elucidated in terms
of angular momentum holonomy by Tiwari [9].Recently Galvez et.al.[10]
has given a experimental measurement of the geometric phase acquired by
the Optical beams bearing orbital angular momentum. They observe the
GP in mode space as suggested by van Enk [11].Now a days the angular
momentum of Photon takes a new way to the physical approach. More
recently Leach et.al [12] proposed a interferometric methods for measuring
the spin and orbital angular momentum of single photon.

All these recent ﬁndings indicate that our previous study on Geometric
phase of a polarized photon (passing through the polarization matrix-M
and a rotator) in connection with helicity[13] was an obvious new repre-
sentation of GP.We have extended this idea evaluating GP through dif-
ferential matrix N from-M [14] In the light of Jones work[15],we in this
paper will study the GP in connection with the dielectric properties of
the optical media. The dielectric property of M is determined from N
matrix to evaluate ﬁrst the phase two-form.Then the change of polar-
ization of the incident light is made over a closed triangle by a rotator
such a way that the variation of angular momentum is visualized through
thePancharatnam Phase in the relativistic framework.

2 The spinorial representation of polar-
ized quanta.

Propagation through distorting obstacle signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the ampli-
tude, phase and polarization state of a light beam.This has consequences
for the behavior of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of Optical beam
that has been measured experimentally [10]. Berry pointed out[16] that
Photons have no magnetic moment and so cannot be turned with a mag-
netic ﬁeld. But they have the property of the helicity, along their propa-
gation direction ek. They may have states with two helicities (σ.ek) =
1,
±
but not zero.The eigenstates of helicity with eigenvalues +1 and
1 are
referred to, respectively, as the right-handed state (spin parallel to motion)
and the left-handed state (spin opposite to motion).

This indicates that the photon in the polarized beam ﬁxes its helicity
whose direction changes with the change of polarization. In an anisotropic
space a particle having a ﬁxed helicity can be viewed as if a direction vector
is attached at the space-time point[17].From the relativistic point of view,
if xµ is the mean position of the particle and yµ indicates the direction
vector then we can consider the resultant coordinate in the complexiﬁed
space as zµ = xµ + iyµ. This extended structure indicates the acquirance
2 = 0.

It can be shown that the two opposite orientations of the direction vector
represent two internal helilities corresponding to fermion and antifermion.
In view of this, we can formulate the internal helicity in terms of two
component spinorial variables θ(¯θ).

Indeed, in the complexiﬁed space-time we can write the chiral coordi-

nate as [17]

per(lower) half-plane. Thus massless spinor exists in this plane. For a
massive particle helicity is incorporated in the internal space and identi-
ﬁed as internal helicity which introduces solitonic feature for the spinor
and gives rise to a massive fermion. In view of this, the internal helicity
may be taken to represent the fermion number where helicity is associated
with spin for massless fermion.

It may be noted that wave-function φ(zµ) = φ(xµ) + iφ(yµ) can be
treated to describe a particle moving in the external space-time having
the coordinate xµ with attacheddirection vector yµ. Thus the wave func-
tion should take into account the polar coordinates r, θ, φ along with the
angle χ which specify the rotational orientation around the direction vec-
tor yµ.for an extended particle θ, φ and χ just represent the three Euler
angles.

In a 3D anisotropic space, we can consider an axis symmetric system
where the anisotropy is introduced along a particular direction. It is to be
noted that in this anisotropic space, the components of linear momentum
satisfy a commutation relation of the form

These represent spherical harmonics for half-orbital angular momen-
tum in an anisotropic space and it is to be noted that from these spherical
harmonics we can construct the polarization matrix M of the complete
optical system [13]. Here, in the next section we shall use this M and N to
evaluate the dielectric properties of the optical device. Then GP of single
photon will be studied from two diﬀerent approaches in the relativistic
framework.

3 The matrix formulation of the Dielec-
tric matrix of the optical system and the
geometric phase

The passage of plane polarized light through partial polarizer or retarda-
tion plate having its plane of polarization parallel to either of the principal
axes, suﬀer no change in the state of polarization. Similarly both type of
circularly polarized light acquire no change in their state of polarization
in passing through a rotator. This property of light with respect to the
optical element was presented in 2
2 matrix method by Jones[18]. The

matrix M n of the optical system of n components having eigenvectors εi
satisfy the condition

M nεi = diεi

vectors εi. For one component optical element the matrix becomes M =

When the optical system is a homogeneous material, one can describe the
optical properties (dielectric and gyration) of the device by the diﬀerential
matrix N , such that it is related with the matrix operator M of the

The propagation through an inﬁnitesimal distance however is described
by the Matrix N ,the vibration at the plane z + dz of the medium, for a
given direction and for a given wave-length, may be deﬁned as the linear
vector function of the vibration at the plane z by the relation

The propagation of polarized light [18] through the anisotropic homoge-
nous medium can be represented by the displacement vector that satisfy
the following relation

where [n] is the refractive index matrix of the medium. This resembles the
usual form of wave equation where the velocity is replaced by the refractive
index matrix [n]. For homogenous anisotropic medium [16],we have[n]2 =
[ε] where [ε] is the two by two matrix representing the dielectric tensor of
the medium connecting ~D. It satisﬁes the customary wave equations of
homogenously polarized light representing the states ~D by the following
relations

[ε] ~D = n2 ~D

where eigenvalues are the refractive indices of the medium. Jones [19]
had shown that the two component dielectric tensor can be written in the
terms of diﬀerential matrix N of the material by

We will study here the geometric phase (GP) from the dielectric property
of the polarization matrix M [13].This GP is concerned with the rotation of
the polarized light over a closed path by twisting once the optical medium
about the direction of propagation.

γ = arg < ψinitial

In case the polarization of the incident light changes over a closed path
on the Poincare sphere, then the GP is identiﬁed as Pancharatnam phase.
Photons have no magnetic moment and so cannot be turned with a mag-
netic ﬁeld. But they have the property of the helicity, along their propa-
gation direction ek They may have states with two helicities (σ.ek) =

which has created signiﬁcant interest in recent years. Hence our emphasis
on the ﬁxedhelicity of polarized photon is fruitful in evaluating GP.

With the above idea the polarization matrix M of the optical element

sented (in sec. 2) relativistically the polarized photon by two component

This dielectric matrix resides on the same Poincare sphere of polarization
matrix M parameterized by the two variables θ and χ. This latter mea-
sures the angle between the direction of measurement and the spin angular
momentum of the polarized photon where the amount of anisotropy µ is
visualized through the relation i ∂
∂χ . Our discussions in previous section
suggests that variation of the angle χ is associated with the change of
angular momentum through the factor µ. We thus add here following the
views of our previous work [13] that the change of polarization of light is
in connection with the change of angle χ. And this is possible when light
passing through the optical devices suﬀer change of polarization due to
transfer of angular momentum. This view is similar to that of Tiwari [9].
Berry [6] showed that the classical optics of slowly-varying dielectric
media with both bierfringence and gyrotropy can generate geometrical
phase shifts. The phase 2-form for such H matrices may be denoted by

In the light of Berry’s work,the dielectric matrix [ε] is analogous to H,
where A0 = 0, the Ax = 2cotθ cos χ, Ay = 2cotθ sin χ and Az = cosec2θ,
only diﬀers from the sign of the determinant. Here the anisotropy in the
dielectric matrix [ε] combine the unaxial birefringence or gyratropy being
present in the phase 2-form V (θ, χ) which will give rise a nonzero γ or
GP.

Now the plane of polarization is turned so as to sweep out a cone, by
keeping θ constant at a particular z values and increasing χ by 2π. This
rotation of χ over a closed path implies the rotation of helicity of the
polarized photon whose net chiral change develops our required relativistic
geometric phase.

Thus it is possible to ﬁnd out a nonzero GP (γ(θ))depending on the angle

θ = 0 and π/2 the value of γ(θ) becomes zero, whereas it attains the
1/√2) for θ = π/4.Further we like to add that
maximum value 4π(1
this GP is not visualizing the spin angular momentum transfer through
the variable χ parameterizing helicity. Next we will proceed to evaluate
the Pancharatnam Phase through variation of helicity.

If the dielectric variation is slow enough, the beam remains in a polar-

It seems that the geometric surface developed by the polarization matrix
M ′ is parameterized by three variables θ, φ and χ (as similar as Euler
angles). The usual polarization matrix (2
2) developed by the parameters
θ and φ lies on the Poincare sphere S2. Here M ′ resides on the extended
Poincare sphere. As the plane of polarization of the incident polarized
light is made to change over a closed path GP is developed.Since this phase
is developed due to the change of angular momentum for variation of χ it
can be termed as angular momentum holonomy. We consider the rotation
of the optical system represented by the Dielectric matrix followed by the
rotator over the contour of a triangle on the extended Poincare sphere,
whose vertices are A = (π/4, 0), B = (π/4, π/2) and C = (π/2, π/2).This

As the plane of polarization of the emergent light from the dielectric
matrix varies over a closed path by a rotator, the Geometric phase is de-
veloped. Since the GP has only dependence on the parameter χ indicating
the angular momentum variation or the change of anisotropy through µ,
this phase can be identiﬁed as the angular momentum holonomy. It does
not include any dynamical phase dependence through the parameter θ,φ.
Hence the dynamical phase can be automatically removed without us-
ing ‘spin-echo’ method[20] by passing the emergent plane polarized light
from the dielectric matrix through a rotator. We suggest the experimen-
tal application of this work to evaluate the angular momentum holonomy
through the approach of Pancharatnam phase.

Discussions
I infer at the end that in the light of Jones calculus, I have determined
the dielectric properties (2
2 matrix) of the polarization matrix M[13].
We have found these matrices on the Poincare sphere parameterized by
the variables θ and χ where the latter deﬁnes the inclination of helicity of
the polarized photon. The orthogonal eigen spinors that are responsible
for the construction of the above matrices are the two component spinor
m,µ. We have shown the appearance of the Ge-
of spherical harmonics Yl
ometric phase in two diﬀerent ways.
1. The phase two-form of the Dielectric matrix by a twist.

2. The rotation of the plane of polarization by inserting a rotator along
with the optical device. The polarized light is made to follow a triangular
closed path on the extended Poincare sphere (θ, φandχ).

The phase two-form is obtained by turning once the polarization (di-
electric) matrix at a ﬁxed χ over a closed path on the Poincare sphere
(θ, χ). In the latter case, the polarization of the incident light is made to
change over a closed triangle on the extended Poincare sphere parameter-
ized by θ, φandχ. The variable χ is associated with the helicity or plane
of polarization and it changes during the course of rotation.Though the
ﬁnal state coincide with the initial their remains a development of angular
momentum holonomy (GP) by the change of angular momentum through
the parameter χ of the chiral photon.The advantage of having the GP
(Pancharatnam phase) of a single photon through the dielectric matrix
and rotator is that it fully depends on helicity of spin angular momentum
through parameter χ. Hence dynamical phase can be removed without
using ‘spin-echo’ method [20]. This is a new relativistic approach to eval-
uate experimentally the angular momentum holonomy of the polarized
photon.

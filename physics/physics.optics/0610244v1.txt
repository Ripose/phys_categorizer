Comment on “Theory of nonlinear ac
responses of inhomogeneous two-component
composite ﬁlms” [Phys. Lett. A 357, 475
(2006)].

Abstract

In this comment, I point out to several mathematical mistakes in the above-referenced
letter.

In a recent letter (1), Xu, Huang and Yu (referred to as XHY below) have
derived eﬀective nonlinear susceptibilities of graded composite ﬁlms. The the-
oretical approach used by XHY is based on the perturbative theory developed
previously in Ref. (2) by Yu (the same author as in the letter which is subject
of this comment), Hui and Stroud. However, XHY make several mathemati-
cal mistakes in applying the formalism of Ref. (2), which are brieﬂy detailed
below.

XHY have considered a two-component ﬁlm whose composition is varied in
one dimension. More speciﬁcally, the volume fractions of the two components
making up the ﬁlm, p1 and p2 (p1 + p2 = 1) were assumed to depend on the
linear coordinate z ∈ [0, L]. Nevertheless, the computation of eﬀective nonlin-
ear responses, given in Eqs. 1-15 of Ref. (1), was carried out for ﬁxed values of
p1 and p2. The dependence of eﬀective linear and non-linear susceptibilities on
z was then expressed through the dependence of p1 and p2 on z, as is evident
from Eqs. 16,17 of Ref. (1). Thus, the gradation of the ﬁlms was assumed to
be slow enough, so that the eﬀective susceptibilities could be physically de-
ﬁned as functions of z. This assumption can be reasonable and is not subject
of this comment. However, the method used for the derivation of the eﬀec-
tive constants at ﬁxed values of p1 and p2 outlined in Eqs. 1-15 of Ref. (1) is
erroneous.

The derivation mentioned above is based on Eq. 14 of Ref. (2). This equa-
tion gives a formula for computing the eﬀective linear dielectric constant of a

1i and hE2

In this formula, hE2
2 i are the averages of the square of the (real-
valued) linear electric ﬁeld, computed inside the ﬁrst and the second con-
stituent of the ﬁlm, respectively, and E0 is the external electric ﬁeld. Because
E1 and E2 are linear ﬁelds, the ratios hE2
0 are independent of E0. Thus,
Eq. 1 gives the eﬀective linear dielectric constant of the composite in terms of
the linear dielectric constants of its constituents as a weighted average. Inci-
dentally, this deﬁnition of ǫe was obtained by equating the total electrostatic
energy of a homogeneous sample occupying some volume V and character-
ized by the linear dielectric constant ǫe and that of a composite occupying
the same volume and characterized by the constants p1,2 and ǫ1,2. Of course,
the ratios hE2
0 must be computed by solving the electrostatic boundary
value problem for each speciﬁc geometry of the composite.

1,2i/E2

In what follows, I detail three mistakes XHY have made in applying Eq. 1 to
the the problem of computing the nonlinear responses of composite ﬁlms.

The First Mistake At the onset, XHY use Eq. 1 to compute the av-
erages hE2
2i, assuming that ǫe is given by some known function,
ǫe = F (ǫ1, ǫ2, p1, p2). Namely, they write (Eqs. 2,3,7 of Ref. (1)):

1i and hE2

hE2

1i =

1
p1

∂F (ǫ1, ǫ2, p1, p2)
∂ǫ1

E2
0

and analogously for hE2
2i. In writing this equation, XHY have ignored the fact
that the averages hE2
2i are themselves functions of both ǫ1 and ǫ2.
Diﬀerentiation of Eq. 1 with respect to ǫ1 (taking into account ǫe = F ) would
yield

1i and hE2

hE2

1i + ǫ1

 

∂hE2

+ p2ǫ2

∂hE2
2 i

=

∂F (ǫ1, ǫ2, p1, p2)
∂ǫ1

0 .

Eq. 2 is derivable from Eq. 3 only if ∂hE2
obviously, is not the case.

1 i/∂ǫ1 = ∂hE2

2 i/∂ǫ1 = 0, which,

The Second Mistake Application of Eq. 2 requires the knowledge of the
function F (ǫ1, ǫ2, p1, p2). To this end, XHY deﬁne F for the graded ﬁlm as

MG(z)dz]−1 (Eq. 21 of Ref. (1)),
a whole (not locally) by writing F = L[
where ǫMG is the Maxwell-Garnett eﬀective dielectric constant that can be
found analytically from Eqs. 16,17 of Ref. (1). The ﬁrst step in this procedure
has not been justiﬁed in Ref. (1) and appears to be arbitrary. More impor-
tantly, the second step requires that the Maxwell-Garnett formula give the
same result for the dielectric constant as Eq. 1 with properly computed ﬁeld
averages. But the two equations are, generally, not equivalent. In Ref. (2), a
Maxwell-Garnett-type formula was derived from Eq. 1 for the case of spheri-
cal inclusions of volume fraction p1 in the limit p1 → 0. But for mixing ratios
close to 0.5, and for high-quality metal inclusions in a dielectric host with the
electromagnetic frequency being close to the Frohlich resonance of a single
inclusion (all of which is the case in numerical examples shown in Ref. (1)),
the Maxwell-Garnett formula is known to be very inaccurate (3). In fact, it
has been demonstrated in Ref. (3) that the Maxwell-Garnett theory provides
a reasonable approximation only for p1 < 10−3.

Physically, computing the averages hE2
2i by means of Eq. 2 (which is,
also incorrect due to the First Mistake), where the analytical form of F is de-
rived from the Maxwell-Garnett formula ignores the well-known phenomenon
of strong ﬂuctuations of electric ﬁeld in resonant composites (4; 5).

1i and hE2

The Third Mistake XHY make the most serious mistake when they state
that the nonlinear susceptibilities can be obtained from Eq. 1 by viewing
the constants ǫ1,2 as intensity-dependent, i.e., by making the substitutions
ǫ1,2 → ǫ1,2 + χ1,2hE2
1,2i in the arguments of the function F , and by expanding
F with respect to the small parameters χ1,2. This procedure is mathematically
expressed in Eq. 6 of Ref. (1) and is clearly erroneous. By deﬁnition, ǫ1,2 in
Eq. 1 are the linear dielectric constants of the composite constituents, as well
as ǫe is, by deﬁnition, the linear eﬀective dielectric constant of the composite.
Computation of higher-order eﬀective susceptibilities would require computing
higher moments of the ﬁeld. For example, the formula derived in Ref. (2) for
the eﬀective third-order susceptibility is

χe = p1χ1

+ p2χ2

hE4
1 i
E4
0

hE4
2i
E4

.

Thus, Eq. 6 of Ref. (1) is based on an incorrect interpretation of the theoretical
results of Ref. (2)

Finally, the conclusion of Ref. (1) that “the harmonics [generated in a graded
composite ﬁlm] are signiﬁcantly dependent on the gradation proﬁles as well as
the width of the composite ﬁlm” is technically (and trivially) correct. However,
equations derived in Ref. (1) can not be used to “monitor the gradation proﬁle
as well as the width of the composite graded ﬁlm by measuring the nonlinear

described in this comment.

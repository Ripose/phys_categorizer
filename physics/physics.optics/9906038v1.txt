Geometrical Optics of Moving Media

A moving dielectric appears to light as an eﬀective gravitational ﬁeld. At low ﬂow velocities the
dielectric acts on light in the same way as a magnetic ﬁeld acts on a charged matter wave. We
develop in detail the geometrical optics of moving dispersionless media. We derive a Hamiltonian
and a Lagrangian to describe ray propagation. We elucidate how the gravitational and the magnetic
model of light propagation are related to each other. Finally, we study light propagation around a
vortex ﬂow. The vortex shows an optical Aharonov–Bohm eﬀect at large distances from the core,
and, at shorter ranges, the vortex may resemble an optical black hole.

I. INTRODUCTION

Consider a glass container ﬁlled with a transparent liq-
uid, say water. Let a plane wave of coherent laser light
travel through the water. Obviously, not much will hap-
pen. The light will remain a plane wave and will only
gather an overall phase shift. Now imagine that the wa-
ter is set into motion. For example, a magnetic mixer
at the bottom of the container creates a vortex. Let us
assume that no air bubbles contaminate the transparent
liquid and that no heat gradient is generated. We know
that water is to a large degree incompressible. Therefore
the refraction index of the whirling liquid is spatially uni-
form. Will the light remain a plane wave? Maybe sur-
prisingly, it will not. Instead, the light will develop an
interference structure that is sensitive to the velocity of
the liquid. Furthermore, if we send in a narrow laser
beam, the vortex will bend the ray. A moving medium
drags light. This eﬀect can be employed to gather infor-
mation about the ﬂow of a transparent liquid. One could
think of reconstructing an unknown velocity proﬁle from
measured interference patterns, as a form of optical to-
mography.

In this paper we develop a systematic theory that
explains motional eﬀects of a nondispersive dielectric
medium on light propagation. We postulate that the
wave equation is valid in all locally comoving frames of
the medium. Then we transform the wave equation to
the laboratory frame. In the limit of geometrical optics
we ﬁnd the Hamiltonian that determines the trajectories
of light rays. Using a diﬀerent implementation of the
same idea (transforming Maxwell’s equations from the
comoving to the laboratory frame) Berry and Klein [1]
have also derived eﬀective scalar and vector potentials
and a Hamiltonian governing light rays and waves. In
addition, we develop a covariant theory of light propa-
gation in moving media. In accordance with an earlier
paper by Gordon [2], we ﬁnd that light rays follow zero–
geodesic lines measured with respect to a certain curved
metric in space–time, similar to the light propagation in
general relativity. The metric of the “glass of water” de-
pends on the refractive index and on the ﬂow, and it

establishes a fascinating analogy between moving media
and gravitational ﬁelds.

Can we see some of the spectacular eﬀects of general
relativity in an earthly laboratory? Most probably, this
would take ﬂow velocities that are comparable with the
speed of light in the medium. Recently, dielectrics with
incredibly low group velocities have been created [3].
These media are far from being as simple as ordinary
liquids, and they are highly dispersive. For instance, the
refractive index reaches unity, i.e. the phase velocity ap-
proaches c, at the frequency where the group velocity
is lowest, i.e. where the refractive index changes most
rapidly. However, as we show in a separate paper [4],
many phenomena that are conceivable for dispersionless
media ﬁnd an experimentally feasible analog in disper-
sive dielectrics. We can thus employ disperionless media
as perfectly consistent relativistic models to understand
the key features of some exotic yet realistic eﬀects of light
in moving dielectrics.

The optics of moving media has a long history. In 1818
Fresnel [5] discovered theoretically that the speed of light
v in a uniform yet moving medium of refraction index n
depends on the medium velocity u as

v =

+

c
n

u .

(1)

So the eﬀective refraction index c/v is changed when the
medium is moving.
In 1851 Fizeau [6] veriﬁed experi-
mentally Fresnel’s motional eﬀect (1). In 1895 Lorentz
[7] derived an additional drag eﬀect that is due to optical
dispersion. Zeeman [8] was able to measure Lorentz’s ef-
fect. In 1913 Sagnac [9] observed phase shifts of light in
a rotating interferometer. In 1925 Michelson, Gale and
Pearson [10] measured the Sagnac eﬀect of Earth’s mo-
tion in an incredible interferometer by 1925 standards.
And of course, today’s ﬁber gyroscopes prove that the
interference of light is sensitive to motion.

Despite the long history of optics in moving media,
a suﬃciently general theory has been still missing, with
the exception of Berry’s and Klein’s parallel work [1], to
the best of our knowledge. Minkowski [11] pioneered the

modern theory of dielectrics in uniform motion. In 1923
Gordon published a far–sighted paper [2] on electromag-
netism in dielectrics and in gravitational ﬁelds. Here he
discovered a deep analogy between gravity and dielectric
media. In our opinion, Gordon [2] also settled the debate
about Minkowski’s [11] versus Abraham’s [12] energy–
momentum tensor in Abraham’s favor [13]. However,
Gordon considered only very brieﬂy the geometrical op-
tics of moving media. Landau and Lifshitz [14] and Van
Bladel [15] summarize to some extend the current state
of the theory, but do not focus on the propagation of
light. More importantly, the motion of the medium has
been usually assumed to be uniform. Exceptions are the
papers [16] that, however, treat only special cases such as
moving dielectric boundaries and the consequent modi-
ﬁcation of Snell’s law and the Brewster angle. Landau
and Lifshitz [14] write explicitly that they “neglect slight
eﬀects due to the possibility of a velocity gradient”.

However, these neglected eﬀects are indeed measur-
able with modern interferometry (see Sec. IV A for an
estimation). Furthermore, eﬀects due to velocity gradi-
ents establish interesting connections between the optics
of moving media and other ﬁelds of physics. Hannay
[17] discovered an analogy between light in moving me-
dia and charged matter waves in electromagnetic ﬁelds.
The ﬂow u turned out to play the role of the electro-
magnetic vector potential. Hannay used path integrals
in paraxial approximation to arrive at this conclusion.
Cook, Fearn, and Milonni [18] analyzed further the con-
nection between light in moving media and charged mat-
ter waves, assuming relatively slow medium velocities and
light that is perpendicularly polarized with respect to
the ﬂow. The magnetic analogy of light in moving me-
dia is particularly interesting, because the light propa-
gation at a ﬂuid vortex corresponds to the Aharonov–
Bohm eﬀect [19] of electron waves that enclose a local-
ized magnetic ﬂux. Light that travels through a dielectric
vortex attains an Aharonov–Bohm phase shift. On the
other hand, atoms that pass an electromagnetic vortex
experience an Aharonov–Bohm eﬀect as well [20].
In-
teresting quantization eﬀects arise when the atoms form
a macroscopic condensate [21]. The magnetic model of
waves in moving media is not restricted to light. Indeed,
Berry et al. [22] report both the theory and an experi-
ment that demonstrates an Aharonov–Bohm eﬀect with
water waves. Acoustical analogs of the eﬀect have been
observed in moving classical media [23] and are predicted
for superﬂuids [24]. However [2], the magnetic model of
light in moving media is only valid as long as the medium
velocities are suﬃciently small. In general, the moving
medium turns out to act rather as a curved metric, i.e.
as a gravitational ﬁeld, on the light. Note that Unruh
[25] arrived at a similar model for non–relativistic sound
in moving ﬂuids that also holds for superﬂuids [26].

In Section II we summarize the theory of eﬀects in ﬁrst
order of u/c before we turn to the general case in Sec. III.
Section II sets the scene by presenting a short review of
partly published yet not widely known results, whereas

Sec. III is the core of our paper. Here we establish the ef-
fective wave equation, a Hamiltonian, a Lagrangian and
the metric of light in moving dispersionless media. Addi-
tionally, we show how the magnetic model of Sec. II and
Refs. [17,18] is related to the gravitational one [2]. Both
Sec. II and Sec. III derive Fresnel’s formula (1), at least
to the lowest order in u/c, seen, however, at each case
in the light of a distinct physical model. Quantitative
diﬀerences between the two concepts are only visible in
higher order. One example of gravitation–like eﬀects is
the light deﬂection at a vortex that we analyze in Sec.
IV and that resembles the deﬂection of light due to Sun’s
gravity. In an extreme case the vortex might even appear
as an optical black hole [4] similar to Unruh’s dumb hole
[25,26].

II. SLOWLY MOVING MEDIA

Consider a moving nondispersive dielectric medium
with refractive index n and ﬂow u. We allow both n
and u to vary in space and time. However, n and u shall
not change signiﬁcantly over the spatial scale of an opti-
cal wave length and over one optical cycle, respectively.
In this section we model light waves by a scalar complex
function ψ, for simplicity. In particular, we do not con-
sider the polarization of light. However, we show in Sec.
III that the propagation of light is indeed independent
of the polarization, as long as the medium varies only
gradually compared to optical oscillations. Furthermore
we assume that the medium moves at moderate velocities
such that we can restrict ourselves to eﬀects that occur
within the lowest order in u/c.

Our starting point is a simple model: Imagine that the
moving medium consists of small cells or drops. Each
cell shall be small enough such that the refractive index
n and the velocity proﬁle u of the medium does not vary
signiﬁcantly. On the other hand, each cell shall be large
compared to the wave length of light. We thus assume
that in each cell (in each comoving frame of the medium
denoted by primes) the optical ﬁeld ψ obeys the wave
equation

Note that this derivation of the wave equation for light in
slowly moving media follows Fresnel’s original idea [5,27]
who divided the ether into an invariant part and a second
part that the medium is able to drag. We will see shortly
that Fresnel’s formula (1) is a direct consequence of the
wave equation (4).

In the limit of Hamilton’s geometrical optics we rep-
resent the optical ﬁeld ψ in terms of a slowly varying
amplitude and a rapidly changing phase,

The wave vector k corresponds to the momentum of a ﬁc-

variation of the amplitude

Light rays in slowly moving media behave like charged

the modulus of the modiﬁed velocity w which is equal to
ω in regions where the medium is at rest,

w2 = ω2 .

We substitute w by the right–hand side of Eq. (13) and
retranslate the resulting dispersion relation into a wave

is a vortex that will act like a thin solenoid, see Sec. IV.
Light rays are not bent, but, similar to the Aharonov–
Bohm eﬀect [19], rays that enclose the vortex attain a
phase diﬀerence [18].

III. LIGHT IN MOVING MEDIA

A. Wave optics

Let us develop a completely relativistic theory of light
propagation in moving nondispersive media. Like in Sec.
II we assume that the refractive index n and the ﬂow u
do not vary signiﬁcantly over one optical wave length and
one optical cycle, respectively. We neglect the dispersion
of light, i.e. the frequency dependence of n. We allow ar-
bitrary medium velocities and we will employ a covariant
notation [30]. Our starting point is the following postu-
late:
In all locally comoving medium frames (denoted
by primes) the electromagnetic ﬁeld–strength tensor F ′

Note that this postulate uses implicitly the assumption
that the refractive index varies only gradually. Otherwise
additional terms become important in the wave equation
[14], terms that describe polarization changes (at the sur-
faces of dielectrics, for instance).

Let us transform the wave equation (19) to the labo-
ratory frame. As a ﬁrst step we reformulate Eq. (19) in
a covariant notation. We employ the four–gradients

(cid:19)

the medium velocities vary only gradually compared with
the rapid oscillations of F ′
µν , we can neglect the deriva-
tives of the Lorentz transformations of F ′
µν in Eq. (24).
In other words, the wave equation (24) is valid both
for F ′
µν and Fµν . Furthermore, the diﬀerential operator
∂′
α∂′α +(n2
α)2 is a Lorentz scalar, and therefore
we can simply drop the primes in Eq. (24), to arrive at

∂α∂α + (n2

Fµν = 0 .

(25)

−

(cid:3)

(cid:2)

This wave equation describes the propagation of light in
a moving nondispersive medium, provided that both the
refractive index n and the ﬂow u varies only gradually.
We see that the ﬁnal wave equation (25) does not mix
the components of the ﬁeld–strength tensor. The prop-
agation of light beams does not depend on the polariza-
tion, i.e. moving media are not birefringent. This result
justiﬁes the scalar model of Sec. II. Note however that
the transport of the ﬁeld amplitudes along light beams
is certainly polarization–dependent. To describe this ef-
fect one should consider, instead of the wave equation
(25), the complete set of Maxwell’s equations in moving
dielectrics [2,14,15].

B. Geometrical optics (Hamiltonian)

How does a moving medium act on light rays? Accord-
ing to Hamilton’s geometrical optics, we try the eikonal
ansatz [30]

sor. A Lorentz transformation of a tensor depends of
course on the velocity of the moving frame [30]. Since

In ﬁrst order in u/c we recognize our previous result (9).
Ray trajectories follow from the Hamiltonian (34) as so-
lutions of Hamilton’s equations (10). Here the time t
plays merely the role of a parameter to describe the tra-
jectories. Of course, inﬁnitely many parameterizations
exist that result in equivalent ray trajectories but stem
from diﬀerent Hamiltonians. Does our particular param-
eterization have a physical meaning? Let us consider the
formal velocity v′ in the comoving medium frame [15],

Light travels with the velocity of light. Therefore, we
can identify the formal ray parameter t with the physical
travel time of light in the laboratory frame.

(36)

Apart from elucidating the physical meaning of time
for our Hamiltonian, the relation (36) is simply an ex-
plicit conservation law during the ray propagation. Con-
servation laws are connected to symmetries. In fact, the
Hamiltonian (34) has the remarkable structure

we ﬁnd a Lagrangian as well? Let us calculate the La-

ture (37) and (38) of the Hamiltonian and the velocity
vector, respectively. We get

L = k

H = 0 .

(39)

The Lagrangian vanishes. Furthermore, we cannot ex-
press the canonical momentum k in terms of the velocity
v, because, according to Eq. (38), v does not depend on
the modulus of k. The encountered problems in intro-
ducing a Lagrangian for light rays in moving media have
been known for the special case of light in vacuum [30]
and have been attributed [30] to the vanishing rest mass
of light.

Let us provide light with an artiﬁcial rest mass m that
we let approach zero at a later, appropriate moment. We
replace the right–hand side of the wave equation (25) by
m2c2Fµν , and we obtain in the limit of geometrical optics
the Hamilton–Jacobi equation

gµν (∂µS)(∂νS) = m2c2 .

We wish to ﬁnd a Lagrangian representation of the phase
S such that

For this we introduce the matrix

gµν = ηµν +

lizing that uνuν is normalized to unity,

We see that the velocity vector v is independent of the

Geometrical optics involves indeed solely the geometrical
aspects of light rays.

a relation that remains valid for vanishing m and ds. In
the magnetic model of light propagation in moving me-
dia, see Sec. II, the three–dimensional k vector diﬀers
from the velocity by an additional term that is propor-
tional to the ﬂow and that plays the role of a vector
potential. However, as we have seen, the contravariant
kµ vector is in fact proportional to the velocity dxµ/dt.
Therefore, the appearance of the ﬂow as a vector poten-
tial is an illusion that we get when we do not discriminate
between co– and contravariant vectors, without yet ap-
preciating the inherent space–time geometry of geomet-
rical optics of moving media.

E. Slowly moving media

In Sec. II we summarized the magnetic model [17,18]
of light in slowly moving media. Let us formulate the
ﬁrst–order eﬀects in terms of the geometrical model [2].
To the lowest order in u/c we obtain the metric

In the limit of low medium velocities, three–dimensional
space appears to be ﬂat to light that travels in the
medium, yet four–dimensional space–time is curved. Let
us compare co- and contravariant wave vectors. As a
consequence of Eqs. (13) and (29) and of the deﬁnition

According to the action principle, light rays minimize
the phase S. Because the phase (44) is proportional to
the artiﬁcial mass m, the minima of S do not depend
on the numerical value of m at all. We thus arrive at
an entirely geometrical picture of ray optics in moving
media, in complete analogy to the equivalence principle
of general relativity. Light rays are geodesic lines with
respect to Gordon’s metric [2]

While traveling in a moving medium, light minimizes the
proper time measured with respect to c/n. And, because
light actually travels with the velocity of light (36), the
proper time is zero on the ray trajectory. Light rays
follow zero–geodesic lines of the metric (50).

A moving medium acts as a curved space–time on light.
In terms of Riemann’s geometry, a medium with uniform
refractive index n turns out to have the scalar curvature

Therefore, the contravariant wave vector appears as the

form (11) of Fresnel’s classic result (1), seen here in the
Riemann–geometrical model of light in moving media.

IV. LIGHT AROUND A VORTEX

A. Optical Aharonov–Bohm eﬀect

Consider a vortex ﬂow in an incompressible liquid. The
vortex may be created by the action of a mixer or simply
by letting the liquid ﬂow out oﬀ the container. To a good
approximation the velocity proﬁle of the vortex is given,
using cylindrical coordinates, by the expression [31]

Let light travel through the whirling liquid. In ﬁrst order
of u/c, light experiences the medium ﬂow in the same way
as a charged matter wave experiences a vector potential
[17,18]. In particular, the vortex (62) corresponds to an
inﬁnitely thin solenoid that generates a strong magnetic
ﬁeld inside yet no ﬁeld outside,

u = W
r

eϕ .

u = 0 .

(62)

(63)

However, as Aharonov and Bohm discovered in their sem-
inal 1959 paper [19], a charged matter wave will attain
a phase shift without feeling a force, and so will light.
We compare the Schr¨odinger equation of Aharonov and
Bohm [19] with the wave equation (17) and read oﬀ the
optical Aharonov–Bohm phase shift

ϕAB = 2πνAB ,

νAB =

(n2

(64)

How large is the eﬀect? For estimating the order of mag-
nitude we assume a refractive index n of 1.5 and an opti-
1015s−1. Furthermore we assume
cal frequency ω of 3
that the liquid circulates at a radius r of 2 cm with a
frequency u/r of 10 s−1. We obtain a phase shift ϕAB
of 10−3. The eﬀect is small, yet one could enhance it
signiﬁcantly by letting the light travel through the liq-
uid many times in an interferometer.
In this case the
phase shift ϕAB is eﬀectively multiplied by the number
of round–trips. One could also perceive the interferome-
ter as a resonator where the eﬀect of the moving medium
changes the spatial mode proﬁle. The precision of mod-
ern interferometry is certainly suﬃcient to detect the op-
tical Aharonov–Bohm eﬀect. (Remember that Fizeau [6]

has seen the precursor of the eﬀect as early as 1851.) Fig-
ure 1 illustrates the long–range behavior of light waves
that pass a vortex ﬂow.

FIG. 1. Light wave passing through a vortex ﬂow. The
picture shows the wave patterns of light in the vicinity of a
vortex. Before reaching the vortex the wave fronts bend and
then they split at the vortex core. Behind the core the two
parts of the wave interfere. We created the picture by follow-
ing a bundle of trajectories. A wave front is deﬁned by the
points reached at a particular value of the time parameter.
Although this approach does not provide information about
the wave amplitudes, the picture is quite accurate, because
mostly only one part of the split wave contributes to interfer-
ence, except in regions very close to the cut at the negative x
axis.

B. Relativistic vortex

Let us analyze vortex eﬀects to higher order in u/c.
Note however that the non–relativistic vortex (62) per-
mits medium velocities that exceed the speed of light,
when taken seriously near the vortex core where higher–
order eﬀects are to be expected. Let us therefore seek a
proper relativistic vortex. We anticipate that the ﬂow is
still circular,

but that we must correct the non–relativistic velocity
proﬁle (62) by the relativistic γ factor (22),

u = u(r)eϕ ,

u = W
γr

,

to prevent the medium from becoming tachyonic. Given
the velocity proﬁle (66), we solve Eq. (22) for γ, and
obtain

Of course, so far we have simply guessed the proper rel-
ativistic generalization of the vortex ﬂow (62). To prove
that our result is indeed physically meaningful, we shall
show that the four–ﬂow (68) is consistent with relativistic
hydrodynamics [32]. First we note that any circular ﬂow
(65) satisﬁes the equation of continuation (53). Then we
prove that the particular four–ﬂow (68) is a solution of
the relativistic Euler equation. For this we construct the
energy–momentum tensor [32]

Here ρ denotes the constant mass density of the incom-

satisﬁes the Euler equation

(71)

This proves that the vortex (68) is indeed a possible ﬂow
that, as we have seen as well, generates the pressure pro-
ﬁle (70). At suﬃciently large distances from the vortex
core the pressure behaves like

At large distances from the core the medium ﬂows as

dramatically relativistic vortices are not to be expected
to be created in experiments on Earth in the near future,
but they might exist as astronomical objects.

FIG. 2. Trajectories of light rays in the vicinity of a vortex
ﬂow. Each picture shows a pair of trajectories belonging to
the same value of the angular momentum. In one case the
light ray approaches the vortex from inﬁnity, is bent, and dis-
appears to inﬁnity. In the other case the light stems from the
origin and falls back after having reached its maximal range
from the vortex core. At distances not covered by these tra-
jectories no light rays are allowed that belong to the chosen
particular value of the angular momentum. (a) Negative an-
gular momentum (positive impact parameter). Light swims
against the current. (b) Positive angular momentum (nega-
tive impact parameter). Light travels with the ﬂow.

D. Optical black hole

A vortex attracts light like any other test particle, be-
cause of the rapidly falling pressure proﬁle (70). Can
light fall into the vortex core? To answer this question
we study the turning points of light rays, using the com-
plete relativistic action (76) with the radial component
(77). Turning points are the zeros of (dR/dr)2 because
beyond these points the action S is purely imaginary and
hence covers a forbidden region. We represent Eq. (77)
as

(97)

In order to prove that the results for intermediate values
of n are physical as well, we show that u3(n) is a mono-
tonically decreasing function. The ﬁrst term in (96) is
a product of two positive and monotonically decreasing
functions and thus is a positive monotonically decreasing
function itself. So is the second term that is subtracted.

The vortex may emit light that begins to fall back to

alternatively, incident light from outside the vortex is
bent and comes to the closest distance to the core at
an outer turning point with positive ζ. To distinguish
inner and outer turning points we calculate ζ± and write
the resulting expression in terms of the derivative of l±

The velocity proﬁle u(r) of the vortex (68) is monotoni-

Otherwise one could invert the system of coordinates to
arrive at a positive vorticity.) Therefore, l+ is positive
and also yields a positive ζ+. Given a positive angular
momentum, any point can be reached as an outer turning
point of incident light rays. Let us turn to the l−. The
angular momentum l− of a turning point is negative out-
side the radius where the medium velocity reaches the
speed of light in the medium, c/n.
Inside this radius
the trajectory that corresponds to l− approaches an in-
ner turning point, because ζ− is negative. On the other
hand, for negative angular momenta a critical radius rs
exists where ζ− vanishes. Beyond this radius all light rays
with negative l must fall into the vortex core. The vortex
appears as a black hole to light with negative angular mo-
menta. Let us calculate the optical Schwarzschild radius
rs. We utilize that

of light rays falling into the vortex core. In case the angular
momentum of an incident ray lies within a critical interval,
the ray is dragged by the vortex ﬂow and ﬁnally falls into the
singularity. (a) We have chosen several values of the angular
momentum that cover most of the critical interval. (b) The
chosen values of the angular momentum lie immediately above
the negative bound of the critical interval.
In this case a
trajectory is very sensitive to small changes in the angular
momentum. The radius of the limiting circle is the optical

V. SUMMARY

A moving dielectric appears to light as an eﬀective
gravitational ﬁeld [2]. At low ﬂow velocities the dielectric
acts on light in the same way as a magnetic ﬁeld acts on
a charged matter wave [17,18]. The ﬂow plays the role
of the vector potential. We have shown how the two ef-
fective models are related to each other: The covariant
wave vector corresponds to the canonical momentum of
a light ray, whereas the contravariant wave vector plays
the role of the kinetic momentum. In curved space–time,
and hence in a dielectric, co- and contravariant vectors
are distinct. For low medium velocities they diﬀer in
precisely the same way as the canonical momentum of a
charged particle diﬀers from the kinetic one by the vec-
tor potential. Additionally, we have derived and studied
an eﬀective Hamiltonian for ray propagation in moving
media. Within the limits of geometrical optics, ray tra-
jectories do not depend on the polarization.
Introduc-
ing a ﬁctitious rest mass for light we have constructed a
corresponding Lagrangian. This way has lead us to the
description of a medium in terms of a metric [2].

First–order optical phenomena are certainly detectable
using modern interferometry and ordinary dielectric ﬂu-
ids.
In this way one could infer the velocity proﬁle of
transparent incompressible liquids from interferometric
measurements. To observe some spectacular relativistic
eﬀects, one could employ highly dispersive quantum di-
electrics [3]. One can demonstrate an optical Aharonov–
Bohm eﬀect and create an optical black hole with a quan-
tum vortex as the center of attraction [4]. Our paper has
established a consistent yet simpliﬁed model of such phe-
nomena. We have thus reason to hope that we may stim-
ulate experiments to demonstrate gravitational eﬀects on
Earth that usually belong to the realm of astronomy.

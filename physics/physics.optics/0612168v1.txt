Depolarization regions of nonzero volume for
anisotropic, cubically nonlinear, homogenized
nanocomposites

Abstract

An implementation of the strong–permittivity–ﬂuctuation theory (SPFT) is presented in order to
estimate the constitutive parameters of a homogenized composite material (HCM) which is both cu-
bically nonlinear and anisotropic. Unlike conventional approaches to homogenization, the particles
which comprise the component material phases are herein assumed to be small but not vanish-
ingly small. The inﬂuence of particle size on the estimates of the HCM constitutive parameters
is illustrated by means of a representative numerical example. It is observed that, by taking the
nonzero particle size into consideration, attenuation is predicted and nonlinearity enhancement is
somewhat diminished. In these respects, the eﬀect of particle size is similar to that of correlation
length within the bilocally–approximated SPFT.

Keywords: Strong–permittivity–ﬂuctuation theory, nonlinearity enhancement, ellipsoidal parti-
cles, depolarization dyadic

INTRODUCTION

Formalisms based on the strong–permittivity–ﬂuctuation theory (SPFT) have been developed to es-
timate the constitutive parameters of homogenized composite materials (HCMs), within the realms
of both linear [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and weakly nonlinear [7, 8, 9, 10] materials. The SPFT approach
to homogenization has the advantage over more conventional approaches, such as those named
after Maxwell Garnett and Bruggeman, that the distributional statistics of the component material
phases is generally better taken into account [11]. For example, the SPFT is most commonly imple-
mented at the level of the bilocal approximation, wherein the distributional statistics are described
in terms of a two–point covariance function and its associated correlation length. Thereby, the

bilocally–approximated SPFT predicts attenuation in the HCM, even when the component phase
materials are nondissipative.

In the SPFT approach to homogenization, and likewise the Maxwell Garnett and Bruggeman ap-
proaches, the electromagnetic responses of the particles which make up the component material
phases are represented by electrically–small depolarization regions [11]. Often, these depolariza-
tion regions are taken to be vanishingly small [12, 13]. The spatial extent of the component phase
particles is thereby neglected. However, the importance of the nonzero spatial extent of the com-
ponent phase particles has been underlined by several studies pertaining to linear isotropic HCMs
[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Furthermore, versions of the SPFT which accommodate depolarization re-
gions of nonzero volume were recently developed for linear anisotropic [20] and bianisotropic3 [21]
HCMs. While these studies take into consideration the nonzero spatial extent of the component
phase particles, it is essential that the particle sizes are much smaller than the electromagnetic
wavelengths, in order for the assembly of component material phases to be regarded as an eﬀec-
tively homogeneous material [11]. Accordingly, at an optical wavelength of 600 nm, for example,
component phase particles with linear dimensions less than approximately 60 nm are envisaged.

In the present study, we extend the consideration of depolarization regions of nonzero volume
into the weakly nonlinear regime for anisotropic HCMs. Our starting point is the SPFT for cu-
In §2
bically nonlinear HCMs which incorporates vanishingly small depolarization regions [10].
the component material phases and their statistical distributions are described. The linear and
weakly nonlinear contributions to the depolarization dyadics, arising from depolarization regions
of nonzero volume, are presented in §3. The corresponding bilocally–approximated SPFT estimate
of the HCM permittivity dyadic is given in §4; and a representative numerical example is used to
illustrate these results in §5. Finally, a few closing remarks are provided in §6.

In the notation adopted, single underlining denotes a 3 vector whereas double underlining denotes

a 3×3 dyadic. The inverse, determinant, trace and adjoint of a dyadic M are represented as M
and M adj , respectively. The permittivity and permeability of free space are

2 HOMOGENIZATION PRELIMINARIES

The homogenization of two component material phases, namely phase a and phase b, is considered.
Each component phase is an isotropic dielectric material; and, in general, each is cubically nonlinear.
Thus, the permittivities of the component material phases are expressed as

ǫℓ = ǫℓ0 + χℓ | E ℓ |2,

(ℓ = a, b),

(1)

with ǫℓ0 being the linear permittivity, χℓ the nonlinear susceptibility, and E ℓ is the electric ﬁeld
developed inside a region of phase ℓ by illumination of the composite material. The assumption
of weak nonlinearity ensures that | ǫℓ0 | ≫ | χℓ | | E ℓ |2. Notice that nonlinear permittivities of the
form (1) describe electrostrictive materials which can induce stimulated Brillouin scattering [22].

The component material phases a and b are made up of ellipsoidal particles. The particles all have

(Ux, Uy, Uz > 0),

which parameterizes the particle surface as

p

re(θ, φ) = η U • ˆr (θ, φ),

(2)

(3)

where ˆr (θ, φ) is the radial unit vector speciﬁed by the spherical polar coordinates θ and φ. The size
parameter η provides a measure of the linear dimensions of the ellipsoidal particles. It is assumed
that η is much smaller than the electromagnetic wavelengths, but not vanishingly small.

The component phase particles are randomly distributed throughout a region of volume V , which
is partitioned into the disjoint regions of volume Va and Vb containing phase a and b, respectively.
Thus, the component phase distributions are characterized in terms of statistical moments of the
characteristic functions

Φℓ(r) =

1,

0,






r ∈ Vℓ,

r 6∈ Vℓ,

(ℓ = a, b).

(4)

The ﬁrst statistical moment of Φℓ delivers the volume fraction of phase ℓ, i.e., h Φℓ(r) i = fℓ. Plainly,
fa + fb = 1. The two–point covariance function which constitutes the second statistical moment of
Φℓ is taken as the physically–motivated form [23]

h Φℓ(r) ihΦℓ(r′) i ,

where L > 0 is the correlation length. Within the SPFT, the estimates of HCM constitutive
parameters are largely insensitive to the speciﬁc form of the covariance function, as has been shown
by comparative studies [8, 24].

3 DEPOLARIZATION DYADIC

Let us focus our attention on a single component phase particle of volume V e, characterized by
the shape dyadic U and size parameter η. Suppose that this particle is embedded in a comparison
medium. In consonance with the ellipsoidal geometry of the component phase particles and the
weakly nonlinear permittivities of the component material phases, the comparison medium is a
weakly nonlinear, anisotropic, dielectric medium characterized by the permittivity dyadic

where E HCM denotes the spatially–averaged electric ﬁeld in the HCM. The eigenvectors of ǫ cm are
aligned with those of U .

The depolarization dyadic [12]

provides the electromagnetic response of the ellipsoidal particle embedded in the comparison
medium. Here, the dyadic Green function of the comparison medium, namely G cm(r), satisﬁes

An elliptic function representation for Dη=0 is available [27] (which simpliﬁes to a hyperbolic

purposes the integral representation (15) is more convenient.

Depolarization dyadics associated with small regions of nonzero volume have lately come under
scrutiny for anisotropic [20] and bianisotropic [21] HCMs. As described elsewhere [10, 20], by the
calculus of residues (14) reduces to

Often the approximation D ≈ Dη=0 is implemented in homogenization studies [11]. However,
studies of isotropic [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], anisotropic [20] and bianisotropic [21] HCMs have
emphasized the importance of the nonzero spatial extent of depolarization regions.

SPFT [5]) is used for this purpose. Thus, ǫ cm is found by solving the nonlinear equations

size parameter η, parametric numerical studies are called for. To this end, we investigate the
following representative example of a homogenization scenario. Let component phase a be a cu-
bically nonlinear material with linear permittivity ǫa0 = 2ǫ0 and nonlinear susceptibility χa =
9.07571 × 10−12ǫ0 m2V−2 (≡ 6.5 × 10−4 esu); and component phase b be a linear material with
permittivity ǫb ≡ ǫb0 = 12ǫ0. The eccentricities of the ellipsoidal component phase particles are
speciﬁed by Ux = 1, Uy = 3 and Uz = 15. These choices of parameter values facilitate direct
comparisons with a previous investigation in which the eﬀects of the size parameter η were not
−1 (equivalent to
included [10]. Results are presented for an angular frequency of ω = π × 1015rad s
a free–space wavelength of 600 nm).

We begin with the relatively straightforward case where neither the size parameter nor the correla-
tion length is taken into account; i.e. η = L = 0. In this case, the SPFT estimates of the constitutive
parameters are equivalent to those of the conventional Bruggeman formalism for weakly nonlinear,
anisotropic, dielectric HCMs [28]. In Fig. 1, the HCM linear and nonlinear constitutive parameters
are plotted against volume fraction fa. The HCM linear permittivity parameters ǫx,y,z
uniformly
decrease from ǫb0 at fa = 0 to ǫa0 at fa = 1. In contrast, the HCM nonlinear susceptibility pa-
rameter χx
Ω, exceeds the nonlinear susceptibility of component phase a
for a wide range of values of fa. This nonlinearity enhancement phenomenon, and its potential
for technological exploitation, have been reported on previously for both isotropic [7, 9, 29, 30]

Ω, and to a lesser extent χy

and anisotropic [10, 28] HCMs. The anisotropy reﬂected by the constitutive parameters, and the
nonlinearity enhancement, stems from the ellipsoidal geometry of the component phase particles.

How does the size parameter η inﬂuence the estimates of the HCM constitutive parameters? To
answer this question, we ﬁx the volume fraction at fa = 0.3 and calculate the HCM constitutive
parameters for 0 < η < 20 nm with L = 0. The presentation of results is aided by the introduction

which measure the diﬀerence between the SPFT estimates calculated for η, L 6= 0 and η = L = 0.
The results are plotted in Fig. 2. It is notable that the HCM constitutive parameters have nonzero
imaginary parts whereas the component material phases are speciﬁed by real–valued constitutive
parameters. As previously described for linear HCMs [20], the presence of nonzero imaginary parts
for the HCM constitutive parameters may be attributed to radiative scattering losses associated
with the nonzero size of the component phase particles. Plainly, increasing the size parameter η has
the eﬀect of increasing the real and imaginary parts of the HCM linear permittivity, but decreasing
the real and imaginary parts of the HCM nonlinear susceptibility. In fact, the inﬂuence of the size
parameter is very similar to the inﬂuence of the correlation length, as has been noted for linear
HCMs [10].

Fig. 2 reveals that by taking into consideration the nonzero size of the component phase particles —
but not the correlation length — the predicted nonlinearity enhancement is somewhat diminished.
We now consider the estimates of the HCM constitutive parameters when both the size param-
eter and the correlation length are taken into account. In Fig. 3, the HCM relative constitutive
parameters are plotted against both L and η/L with the volume fraction ﬁxed at fa = 0.3. Only
Ω are presented; the corresponding plots for ǫy,z
the results for ǫx
Ω are similar. It
may be observed in Fig. 3 that the eﬀects of η and L are cumulative insofar as the increase in the
real and imaginary parts of ǫx,y,z
, which
occur as η increases, become steadily more exaggerated as L increases.

6 CONCLUDING REMARKS

The size of the component phase particles can have a signiﬁcant bearing upon the estimated consti-
tutive parameters of weakly nonlinear anisotropic HCMs, within the bilocally–approximated SPFT.
Most obviously, by taking nonzero particle size into consideration, attenuation is predicted and the
degree of nonlinearity enhancement is somewhat diminished. In respect of both of these eﬀects, the
inﬂuence of particle size is similar to the inﬂuence of correlation length. Furthermore, the eﬀects of
particle size and correlation length on both the linear and nonlinear HCM constitutive parameters
are found to be cumulative.

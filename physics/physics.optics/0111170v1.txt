In diﬀraction catastrophes such as the rainbow the wave nature of light resolves ray singularities
and draws delicate interference patterns.
In quantum catastrophes such as the black hole the
quantum nature of light resolves wave singularities and creates characteristic quantum eﬀects related
to Hawking radiation. The paper describes the theory behind a recent proposal [U. Leonhardt,
arXiv:physics/0111058, Nature (in press)] to generate a quantum catastrophe of slow light.

I. INTRODUCTION

Diﬀraction catastrophes [1] are at the heart of many
fascinating optical phenomena. The most prominent ex-
ample of such a catastrophe is the rainbow. Light rays
from the Sun enter water droplets ﬂoating in the air. Af-
ter two refractions and one reﬂection inside each drop the
rays reach an observer. Above a critical observation angle
no rays arrive, whereas below the angle two rays strike
the observer. A bright bow, the rainbow, appears at the
critical angle, because here the cross section of light rays
diverges [2]. (The critical angle depends on the refractive
index that varies with the frequency of light in dispersive
media such as water, giving rise to the rainbow colors.)
The direction of a light ray is proportional to the gradient
of the phase. The rainbow thus represents a singularity
of a gradient map, a catastrophe in the sense of Thom
[3] and Arnol’d [4]. Structurally stable singularities of
gradient maps fall into distinct classes, depending on the
number of control parameters involved [3,4]. Structural
stability is the key to Nature’s way of focusing light [5]
in the caustics created by ray catastrophes. Yet the wave
nature of light smooths the harsh singularities of rays. Si-
multaneously, characteristic interference eﬀects appear.
For example, the pairs of light rays below the rainbow
create a delicate pattern of supernumerary arcs [1] that
are visible under favorable weather conditions (when the
ﬂoating droplets are nearly uniform in size [2]). Every
class of diﬀraction catastrophes generates its distinct in-
terference structure [1].

Catastrophe optics describes the wave properties of ray
singularities. In the hierarchy of physical concepts, wave
optics reﬁnes and embraces ray optics, and quantum op-
tics rules above wave optics. So, what would be the
quantum eﬀects of wave catastrophes? First, what are
quantum catastrophes? It might be a good idea to begin
with an example, the black hole [6]. When a star col-
lapses to a black hole an event horizon is formed, cutting
space into two disconnected regions. Seen from an out-
side observer, time stands still at the horizon, freezing
all motion. A light wave would freeze as well, propa-
gating with ever-shrinking wavelength. In mathematical

terms [7], a monochromatic light wave of frequency ω
rs)iµ when the radius r ap-
oscillates as Θ(r
proaches the horizon rs, with µ = 2rs ω/c. A logarith-
mic phase singularity will develop. Potential quantum
eﬀects of such a wave singularity are eﬀects of the quan-
tum vacuum. The gravitational collapse [6] of the star
into the black hole has swept along the vacuum. The vac-
uum thus shares the fate of an inward-falling observer.
Yet such an observer would not notice anything unusual
at the event horizon. In mathematical terms, the vac-
uum modes are analytic across the horizon [7,8]. On the
other hand, the modes perceived by an outside observer
are essentially non-analytic, because they vanish beyond
the horizon where the observer has no access to. Con-
sequently, the observer does not see the electromagnetic
ﬁeld in the vacuum state. Instead, the observer notices
the quanta of Hawking radiation [9] with the Planck spec-
1)−1. The quantum vacuum does not as-
trum (e2πµ
rs)iµ,
sume catastrophic waves of the type Θ(r
hence resolving so the associated wave singularity and, si-
multaneously, generating quantum radiation with a char-
acteristic spectrum. At the heart of such a catastrophe
lies a time-dependent process, for example the gravita-
tional collapse in the case of the black hole [6]. The
process has disconnected the spatial regions where waves
can propagate and has created a logarithmic phase singu-
larity at the interface. Any time-dependent phenomenon
will generate some radiation, as long as the process lasts.
In remarkable contrast, a quantum catastrophe creates
quanta continuously.

This paper describes the theory behind a recent
idea [10] to generate a quantum catastrophe of slow
light [11–19]. An experiment is proposed based on
Electromagnetically-Induced Transparency (EIT) [15].
In EIT a control beam determines the optical properties
of slow light in a suitable medium. Changing the inten-
sity of the control light from a uniform to a parabolic
proﬁle creates s slow-light catastrophe [10], see Fig. 1.
This catastrophe resembles the event horizon of a black
In
hole but also shows some characteristic diﬀerences.
Section II we put forward a rather general phenomeno-
logical quantum ﬁeld theory of slow light. Appendix A

justiﬁes the theory for the most common method to slow
down light using EIT [15]. In Section III we address the
speciﬁc theory of the slow-light catastrophe [10]. Ap-
pendix B contains some estimations that are relevant to
the experimental aspects involved. Section IV summa-
rizes the results and draws a further vision of quantum
catastrophes.

FIG. 1. Schematic diagram of the proposed experiment. A
beam of control light with intensity Ic generates Electromag-
netically-Induced Transparency [15] in a medium, strongly
modifying its optical properties for a second ﬁeld of slow light.
When an initially uniform control intensity is turned into the
parabolic proﬁle shown in the ﬁgure, the slow-light ﬁeld suf-
fers a quantum catastrophe. To slow-light waves, the interface
Z of zero control intensity cuts space into two disconnected
regions and creates a logarithmic phase singularity, in analogy
to the eﬀect [7] of an event horizon [6]. The quantum vacuum
of slow light cannot assume such catastrophic waves. In turn,
pairs of slow-light quanta, propagating in opposite directions
away from Z, are emitted with a characteristic spectrum. The
waves shown below the intensity proﬁle refer to the emitted
light with the modes wR and wL of Eq. (51).

II. THE MODEL

Electromagnetically-Induced Transparency (EIT) [15]
has served as a method to slow down light signiﬁcantly
[11] or, ultimately, to freeze light completely [12–14].
Like other successful techniques, EIT is based on a simple
idea [15]: A control beam of laser light couples the upper
levels of an atom, and, in this way, the beam strongly

2

modiﬁes the optical properties of the atom.
In partic-
ular, the coupling of the excited states aﬀects the tran-
sition from the atomic ground state to one of the up-
per states, i.e., the ability of the atom to absorb probe
photons with matching transition frequency. Destructive
quantum interference between the paths of the transi-
tion process turns out to eliminate absorption at exact
resonance [15]. A medium composed of such optically-
manipulated atoms is transparent at a spectral line where
it would otherwise be completely opaque. In the vicinity
of the transparency frequency ω0 the medium is highly
dispersive, i.e. the refractive index changes within a nar-
row frequency interval. In turn, probe light pulses with
a carrier frequency at ω0 travel with a very low group
velocity vg [16]. The intensity Ic of the control beam de-
termines the group velocity of the probe pulse, as long
as Ic is stronger than the probe. Paradoxically, the lower
Ic is the slower moves the pulse, which, however, is only
possible when the electronic states of the atoms follow dy-
namically the control ﬁeld [17], causing the probe-light
intensity to fall accordingly [17].
In this regime light
freezes when Ic vanishes [12–14].

The theory of EIT [15] often employs an atomic three-
level scheme: Two levels account for the excited states
coupled by the control ﬁeld and one level represents the
ground state, see Appendix A. In reality, atoms are more
complicated and, when details matter, an accurate de-
scription involves the full atomic sub-level structure [18].
Here we put forward a phenomenological quantum theory
of slow light that is rather independent of the microscopic
mechanisms used in practice. We assume only that the
slow-light medium is transparent with a real susceptibil-
ity that depends linearly on the detuning from ω0.
In
EIT our model is restricted to the narrow transparency
window around ω0 that can maximally reach the natural
line width of the atomic transition. Appendix A shows
that our model agrees with the three-level theory of EIT.
Our theory is simple enough to be treated analytically
and yet suﬃciently complex to capture the essence of
slow-light quanta. We postulate an eﬀective Lagrangian
L , show that L is consistent with the known dynamics
of EIT within the validity range of our model, calculate
the energy and quantize the ﬁeld of slow-light polaritons.
Our approach has the additional advantage that it may
be applicable to other mechanisms [19] for creating slow
light that do not rely on EIT.

A. Lagrangian

We characterize slow light by a real scalar ﬁeld ϕ ignor-
ing the polarization. The optical ﬁeld ϕ shall be given in
units of the vacuum noise [20]. For simplicity, we assume
uniformity in two spatial directions, x and y, and regard
the optical ﬁeld as a function of time t and position z.
Throughout this paper we denote partial time derivatives

by dots, by diﬀerential operators ∂t or simply by suf-
ﬁxes t, whatever happens to be most convenient. Spatial
derivatives are denoted by dashes, diﬀerential operators
∂z or suﬃxes z. We postulate the eﬀective Lagrangian

At a later stage we need to consider negative frequencies
as well. To verify that the dispersion relation (6) is also
valid in the corresponding negative transparency window
we utilize the general property of a spectral susceptibility

We see in the next subsection that the real parameter
function α determines the group velocity, and hence we
call α group index. In EIT [15] the parameter α is in-
versely proportional to the control-ﬁeld intensity,

which implies near

,

with a coupling strength κ that is proportional to the
modulus squared of the atomic dipole-transition matrix
element and to the number of atoms per unit volume.
Without the EIT medium present, L is the Lagrangian
of a free electromagnetic ﬁeld, ε0
c2B2) with ﬁxed
polarization. We see that ϕ is related to the electric ﬁeld
strength E in SI units by

where ω denotes the frequency of light and ε0 is the elec-
tric permittivity of the vacuum.

In order to motivate the Lagrangian (1) we consider

the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation [22],

ϕ = 0 .

(cid:1)

This is the propagation equation of slow light based on
the traditional three-level model, see Appendix A, but
the equation holds on more general grounds: Equation
(5) describes light in media with linear spectral suscepti-
bility. Assuming that the optical ﬁeld oscillates at much
shorter time and length scales than any variations of α,
we replace i∂t by the frequency ω and
i∂z by the wave
number k. We arrive at the dispersion relation

We see that as long as the frequency of the probe light
lies within the transparency windows of EIT, the La-
grangian (1) reproduces the typical linear slope of the
spectral susceptibility. In fact, up to a trivial prefactor,
L is the only Lagrangian that is quadratic in the ﬁeld
and its derivatives and that is consistent with the spec-
tral susceptibilities (8) and (10). Therefore we regard L
as a suitable Lagrangian for slow light.

B. Dynamics

The ability to freeze light by turning oﬀ the control
ﬁeld depends crucially on the dynamics of the process.
Consider a time-dependent group index α without sig-
niﬁcant spatial variations. In this case slow light is dom-
inated by oscillations within an optical wave length and
an optical cycle. We express the wave as

This is exactly the propagation equation of slow light
in the adiabatic and perturbative limit (Eq. (9) of Ref.
[17] with the Rabi frequency Ω being proportional to
Ec).
Consequently, the Lagrangian (1) has codiﬁed naturally
the correct dynamic regime including the 1
term that
describes reversible stimulated Raman scattering [17].

vanishing control ﬁeld when vg vanishes as well, as long as
κ is large (for a suﬃciently dense medium). The spectral
spread of a pulse is reduced by vg/c and a standing pulse
oscillates just with the carrier frequency. In this regime
slow light does not leave the transparency window of EIT
[13]. One can freeze light without losing control [12,13].

C. Energy

After having gained conﬁdence in our ﬁeld-theoretical
approach, we use the Lagrangian (1) to calculate the en-
ergy balance of slow light. According to general rela-
tivity [21], the symmetric energy-momentum tensor T µν
is uniquely determined as a variation of the Lagrangian
L with respect to the space-time metric. To apply this
concept, we represent our Lagrangian (1) in a relativistic
form. We introduce the contravariant space-time coor-
dinates x0 = ct, x1 = z and employ a metric tensor gµν
with the determinant g and the inverse gµν .
In a ﬂat
space-time described in Cartesian coordinates, gµν is the
1, and gµν equals
1), g gives
Minkowski metric diag(1,
diag(1,
1) as well. In order to write the Lagrangian (1)
in covariant form, we represent α ˙ϕ2 in terms of the four-
velocity uν of the EIT medium. In a co-moving medium
frame, the time component of the four-velocity, u0, is
unity while the space component u1 vanishes. Therefore,
adopting Einstein’s summation convention, α ˙ϕ2 takes on
the covariant form α(uν∂ϕ/∂xν)2. In this way we ﬁnd

Temporal changes in the control ﬁeld, modifying the
group index (2), do not conserve energy. In fact, the ex-
periment [12] indicates that the control beam can amplify
light stored in an EIT medium with zero group velocity.
In the experiment [12], slow light enters the EIT sam-
ple and is then frozen inside by turning oﬀ the control
ﬁeld. Switching on the control releases the stored light.
The pulse emerges with an intensity that depends on the
control ﬁeld and that may exceed the initial intensity,
in agreement with Eq. (15). Clearly, this phenomenon
is only possible if energy is indeed transferred from the
control beam to the probe light.

D. Polaritons

Finally, we realize the full potential of the Lagrangian
(1) in setting up an eﬀective quantum theory of slow
light. The classical canonical momentum density of the
ﬁeld ϕ is [22,24]

δL
δ ˙ϕ

= ¯h(1 + α) ˙ϕ .

(21)

We quantize the ﬁeld by regarding ϕ and δL /δ ˙ϕ as Her-
mitian operators ˆϕ and ˆπ, respectively, with the canoni-
cal commutation relations [22,24]

[ ˆϕ(t, z), ˆϕ(t, z′)] = [ˆπ(t, z), ˆπ(t, z′)] = 0 ,
[ ˆϕ(t, z), ˆπ(t, z′)] = i¯h δ(z

z′) .

Consequently, the annihilation and creation operators ˆaq
and ˆa†
q refer indeed to the energy quanta of slow light.
The quasiparticles of light in a dielectric medium are
called polaritons in analogy to the optical excitations in
a solid [25]. They combine characteristic features of free
photons with the properties of the dipole oscillations of
the atoms constituting the medium. When light is slowed
down photons turn into atomic excitations that, after ac-
celeration, may emerge as photons again [12,13]. The
polariton picture contains implicitly the correct book-
keeping of the photonic and atomic features of light in
linear media.

One can use similar arguments as in the subsection on
the dynamics of slow light to prove that the proposed po-
lariton theory is consistent with the adiabatic three-level
model [17]. Yet our approach is not restricted to a regime
dominated by spatial oscillations of the form exp(iωz/c),
see Eq. (11), which is in essence the regime of geomet-
rical optics [26]. One can easily relax this unnecessary
constraint of the three-level theory, because the electro-
magnetic response of an atom is local, as long as the wave
length of light is large compared with the size of the atom.
The adiabatic polariton theory [17] is, as ours, restricted
to a narrow frequency range with respect to time, i.e.,
to the transparency window of the electromagnetically-
manipulated medium. Yet this restriction in frequency
does not exclude rapid spatial oscillations beyond the
scale of the wave length in vacuum, 2πc/ω. We will see
in the next section that such oscillations occur near a
spatial singularity of the group index. In this situation
our quantum ﬁeld theory of slow-light polaritons turns
into a perfect tool for analyzing the quantum physics of
a wave catastrophe.

Consequently, and in agreement with the spin-statistics
theorem [22], slow light consists of bosons. Let us ex-
press the total energy (19) in terms of the annihilation
and creation operators ˆaq and ˆa†
q. Consider the case of
a stationary group index α when the total energy is con-
served. We obtain after partial integration, via the wave
equation (5) for the ﬁeld operators,

III. THE CATASTROPHE

Imagine that the control beam illuminates the EIT
medium from above. Initially, the control intensity is uni-
form, but then the control light develops a dark node that
of zero intensity Ic through a
continues as an interface

part of the medium. One could use computer-generated
holograms to achieve this situation, similar to the gener-
ation of Laguerre-Gaussian beams [27]. Suppose that the
interface is suﬃciently ﬂat and cuts deep enough into the
medium to justify our model. (We have assumed unifor-
mity in the two spatial directions x and y that are par-
allel to the interface. Most probably, uniformity over a
few wave lengths would suﬃce.) Near a zero in the inten-
sity, the control ﬁeld strength must grow linearly. Con-
sequently, Ic depends quadratically on z and, according
to the relation (2), the group index α forms a quadratic
singularity where the group velocity (16) vanishes,

α =

(31)

a2
z2 .
The parameter a sets the scale of the group-index pro-
ﬁle. We assume that the spatial proﬁle (31) of the group
index extends over a suﬃciently long range. For simplic-
ity, we consider a one-dimensional model where the slow
light propagates in z direction only. Appendix B general-
izes our results to a realistic three-dimensional situation.
Apart from these idealizations and from the physics cap-
tured in our Lagrangian (1), we make no further approx-
imations.

A. Horizon

At a node of the control ﬁeld the group velocity of the
probe light vanishes. Therefore we would expect that
no wave packet of slow light can pass the interface
.
Z
Consider slow light subject to the wave equation (5) with
the group-index proﬁle (31). We represent a wave ϕ(t, z)
as

Here k abbreviates ω/c and k0 refers to ω0/c. So, in

light are products of a square root with Bessel functions
[28],

Depending on the detuning of the frequency ω with re-
spect to the exact transparency resonance ω0, two cases
emerge. First, when 4a2(k2
k2
0) is below unity the Bessel
−
index ν is real. We apply the asymptotics of the Bessel
functions for large and positive arguments ρ [28],

We see that in the far ﬁeld the light waves with real
Bessel indices are in a perfectly balanced superposition
of incident and emerging plane waves. In other words, the
light is totally reﬂected away from the interface of zero
group velocity, similar to the reﬂection of radio waves at
the Earth’s ionosphere [29].

A more interesting scenario appears in the second case
when the light is suﬃciently blue-detuned to evoke an
imaginary Bessel index

ν = iµ .

(38)

This regime can be reached by adjusting the gradient of
the control ﬁeld that plays a decisive role in Eqs. (2) and
(31). The smaller the gradient is the larger is a2. There-
fore, a suﬃciently small control-ﬁeld gradient gives rise
to an imaginary Bessel index ν, even within the narrow
transparency window in frequency ω = kc. On the other
hand, as we will see at a later stage, the gradient should
be as large as possible for producing a maximal quantum
eﬀect. When the Bessel index ν is imaginary the inci-
dent and the reﬂected waves are not balanced anymore,
as we see from the asymptotics (37) of the Bessel func-
tions. Only a fraction of the incident wave is reﬂected
and the rest must be transmitted somewhere. To ﬁnd
the transmitted wave, we focus on the behavior of the
Bessel functions for small arguments. We use the ﬁrst
term in the power series [28],

Therefore, near the interface of zero group velocity the
light waves are proportional to

The transmitted wave thus freezes in front of the interface

We regard a process that creates an interface where
waves separate and develop a logarithmic phase singu-
larity as a wave catastrophe. The gravitational collapse
of a star into a black hole has created an horizon that
cuts space into two disconnected parts as well [6]. Close
to the event horizon, an outside observer would see a
similar behavior of waves [7]. All motion freezes near the
horizon of the hole which, therefore, has also been termed
frozen star [30]. In view of this analogy we regard the in-
terface of zero group velocity
as the optical analog of
a horizon.

B. Modes

Consider a superposition of suﬃciently blue-detuned
slow-light waves (36) with imaginary Bessel indices (38).
To analyze the quantum eﬀects of the horizon on polari-
tons, we must turn the waves into modes (23), i.e., we
must normalize the wave functions according to the scalar
product (25). Waves (36) with diﬀerent wave numbers
k are orthogonal to each other and possess a continu-
ous spectrum. Hence they should be normalized to delta
functions. We employ the ratio k/k0 as the dimensionless
mode index q that occurs in the scalar product (25). The
normalization factor is entirely determined by the way in
which the norm (25) diverges to reach the δ singularity
[31]. Consequently [31], we can ignore all ﬁnite, converg-
ing contributions to the normalization integral given by
Eqs. (25), (31), and (36),

C. Analyticity

−

The stationary modes (51) of catastrophic slow light
are severely non-analytic. The modes vanish on either
the left or the right side of the horizon with a charac-
teristic essential singularity as a precursor. Waves near
the event horizon of a black hole suﬀer a similar fate [7].
Seen from an outside observer, the waves freeze near the
Schwarzschild radius rs with an essential singularity of
rs)iµ where µ = 2rsω/c [7]. Yet an ob-
the type (r
server falling into the hole would see little diﬀerence in
waves near the horizon and could pass the point of no re-
turn without noticing. Like the inward-falling observer,
the quantum vacuum ﬂows towards the central singular-
ity of the hole and, similarly, the horizon should not be
a special place for the vacuum either. In mathematical
terms, the wave function of the vacuum is analytic [7,8].
Consequently, the modes seen by the outside observer
must not be in their vacuum states. In fact, they carry
the quanta of Hawking radiation [9]. The history of the
hole formation during a gravitational collapse turns out
to be responsible for the analyticity of the vacuum [7,8].
Inspired by the analogy between a black hole and our
slow-light catastrophe, let as consider the history of our
horizon.

ter a time tc the group index will possess the quadratic

Regarded as a function of complex z, the ϕ± waves are
analytic in the upper (+) or lower (

tively, because here the integral (53) converges. When
the control ﬁeld creates a horizon the vacuum modes
must follow the wave equation (5). We assume that α
is analytic apart from poles. Consider closed contour in-
tegrals in either one of the half planes. We obtain from
the wave equation (5),

contribute to the closed contour integrals. Consequently,
the vacuum wave functions are always analytic in z.

Consider the analytic properties of the vacuum waves
with respect to time. Picture a wave with positive fre-
quencies incident from the left, see Fig. 2. After the
catastrophe a part of the wave may freeze at the horizon
and the rest is reﬂected. If the wave happens to arrive
during the formation of the horizon a brief burst of light
with negative frequencies may be generated. However,
in the stationary regime we are interested in, the re-
ﬂected light contains always positive frequencies. There-
fore we regard the wave function ϕ(t, z) on the left side of
the horizon as analytic in t on the lower complex plane.
Given an analytic signal ϕ(t) at some z we can propa-
gate it in space according to the wave equation (5) with-
out loss in analyticity, but we cannot pass the horizon,
because here α is singular.
It is therefore conceivable
that beyond the horizon ϕ(t) is not analytic anymore.
In other words, ϕ(t) may contain negative frequencies.
In fact, we show in the next subsection that negative
frequencies in time are unavoidable for not running into
conﬂict with the analyticity in the spatial coordinate z.
Waves propagating to the right are analytic in z on the
upper half plane and they must have originated from a
wave incident from the left. The analytic properties of
the vacuum waves in space are thus connected with their
analytic properties in time. Analyticity in the upper half
of the z plane is linked to analyticity in t on the left side
and, using similar arguments, analyticity in the lower
half of the z plane goes hand in hand with analyticity
in t on the right side. We utilize the analytic properties
of the vacuum waves in space and time as a marker for
distinguishing the vacuum modes.

FIG. 2. Space-time diagram of a slow-light catastrophe.
The ﬁgure illustrates the fate of a wave packet ϕ(t, z) that ex-
periences the formation of the horizon Z. Initially, the packet
oscillates with positive frequencies in time t and propagates
from the left to the right in space z. The horizon cannot gen-
erate negative frequencies in the reﬂected light, apart from a
brief burst that we neglect. On the left side of Z we thus re-
gard ϕ(t, z) as analytic in t on the lower half of the complex t
plane. Furthermore, ϕ(t, z) is analytic in z on the upper half
plane throughout the history of the wave packet, because the
process (5) conserves analyticity. Yet ϕ(t, z) is not analytic
in t on the other side of the horizon, as the solution (55) indi-
cates. Here waves with negative frequencies are continuously
peeling away from the horizon, corresponding to a stationary
creation of slow-light quanta.

D. Combinations

The vacuum states of slow-light polaritons are char-
acterized by analytic wave functions in z. Therefore, to
describe the vacuum after the formation of the horizon,
we should construct orthonormal combinations v of the
non-analytic u and w modes that are analytic on either
the upper or the lower half of the complex z plane at
some arbitrary time t0. The solution is

Because the u and w modes are orthonormal with respect
to the scalar product (25), one can easily verify that the
v modes form an orthonormal set as well.

The modes (55) are given on the real z axis and are
subject to analytic continuation. We prove that the vR

This relation proves the analyticity of the combinations
(57) and (58) and, as a result, the analyticity of the
modes (55).

However, is the set of modes (55) unique? In princi-
ple, we could perform linear canonical transformations

that convert the modes (55) into a new set, yet such
transformations are severely restricted by the required
analyticity in space and time. For example, we can
construct superpositions of the vR and v⊥
R modes to
form the new modes vR cos θ + eiγv⊥
R cos θ

e−iγvR sin θ, analogous to the mode transformation of
a beam splitter [33]. Or we may combine vR with v∗

in the Bogoliubov transformation vR cosh ξ + eiγv∗
L sinh ξ
and v⊥
L sinh ξ, analogous to a parametric
ampliﬁer [34]. However, only transformations of this
type maintain the analyticity on one of the half planes
of complex z. We are not allowed to combine vR with
v⊥
or vR with vL. Yet the possible mode transforma-
R
tions are further restricted: a Bogoliubov transformation
vR cosh ξ + eiφv∗
L sinh ξ would generate negative frequen-
cies on the left side of the horizon. We have argued
that this must not happen. Similar arguments apply
to all other Bogoliubov transformations. Consequently,
our modes are uniquely deﬁned up to superpositions, but
such transformations do not change the vacuum state
[33]. Therefore, the v modes are indeed the vacuum
modes.

As a consequence of a slow-light catastrophe, the po-
lariton ﬁeld is decomposed into two diﬀerent sets of
modes. The v modes contain the polariton vacuum,
whereas the u and w modes guide the detectable quanta,

The ˆa operators are the annihilation operators of the de-

modes. H.c. denotes the Hermitian conjugate and the
q are the mode indices k/k0. Notice that the vacuum
modes contain both positive and negative frequency com-
ponents, because the set (55) involves complex conjugate
w modes. Therefore we expect that the corresponding
operator transformations combine annihilation with cre-
ation operators. This is the decisive sign of pair creation,
similar to the production of photon pairs in parametric
downconversion [20]. We represent ˆaR as (wR, ˆϕ), ˆaR⊥
as (uR, ˆϕ) et cetera, use the normalization (24) and the
properties of the scalar product (25), and arrive at the
Bogoliubov transformations [24]

The radiation energy will be taken from the control beam.
The initial formation of the horizon is a time-dependent
process that, therefore, transfers energy to the polariton
ﬁeld. Yet, in addition to an initial brief burst of energy,
the control beam creates a wave catastrophe that would
force polaritons into a state they cannot occupy. The
frustrated polariton ﬁeld reacts in attempting to alter
the parabolic proﬁle of the control intensity. This process
takes energy away from the control beam and allows the
creation of polarition pairs. Pair production continues as
long as the control beam is not signiﬁcantly depleted. A
running wave of control light will produce a steady ﬂow
of slow-light quanta.

·

The slow-light catastrophe generates a maximal parti-
cle number per mode (64) of 1/4, which is quite substan-
tial, considering the fact that bright sunlight with a radi-
103K carries a mere 0.01 photons
ation temperature of 6
per mode in the optical range of the Planck spectrum.
However, the photon number (64) is sharply peaked as
a function of µ and, in any case, our pair-production
mechanism is restricted to the narrow frequency window
of EIT [15]. To maximize the generated quantum radia-
tion, one should create a situation where µ is near zero
over an as large as possible spectral range. In terms of
the experimental parameters, we get in the transparency
window near ω0,

Pair production occurs on the blue side of the critical
detuning δ0 (for δ > δ0) where δ0 also determines the
width of the spectrum (64). The smaller the scale a of
the group-index proﬁle (31) is, the larger is the criti-
cal detuning (65) and the wider is the spectrum (64)
of particle production. Equations (2) and (16) indicate
that the scale a is small for a steep group-velocity proﬁle
created by a large control-ﬁeld gradient. Gravitational
black holes show a similar behavior [9]. The smaller the
hole is, the larger is the gravity gradient at the hori-
zon and the stronger is the Hawking radiation [9] gener-
ated. Returning to our case, the parameter-dependence
of the particle-number spectrum (64) underlines the cru-
cial role of a spatially varying group velocity in creating

10

a quantum catastrophe. A mere zero of the group veloc-
ity would not suﬃce to produce a measurable radiation.
The control-ﬁeld gradient matters.

Close to the horizon the susceptibility of slow light
diverges. Yet Nature tends to prevent inﬁnite suscepti-
bilities: Instead of responding inﬁnitely strongly, opti-
cal media become absorptive or non-linear. Considering
gravitational black holes, Nature could prevent the exis-
tence of true event horizons as well. Here waves are sup-
posed to shrink in wave lengths beyond the Planck scale
where the physics is unknown. Hawking radiation seems
to stem from these extremely shortened waves. This
trans-Planckian problem [35] was analyzed in theoretical
toy models of sonic black holes in moving ﬂuids [36,37].
Here the inter-atomic distance provides a natural cut-oﬀ
for extremely shortened sound waves. Nevertheless [37],
the mere threat of a horizon seems to be suﬃcient for
generating Hawking sound.

Returning to slow light, an EIT medium in linear re-
sponse is transparent within a narrow spectral window
around the resonance frequency ω0. The spectral width
of the transparency window is proportional to the inten-
sity of the control beam [15]. Therefore, slow-light waves
oscillating at frequencies diﬀerent from ω0 are absorbed
near a node of the control ﬁeld, unless the medium be-
comes non-linear. We show in Appendix A that the non-
linearity of the EIT medium depends on the ratio of the
probe and control intensities. According to the linear
optics of slow light discussed in the body of this paper,
the probe intensity is proportional to the distance z from
the horizon, as long as kz is small, whereas the control
intensity grows quadratically. Consequently, at a cer-
tain distance z0 both ﬁelds are comparable in strength.
Here slow light leaves the regime of linear response. In
a semi-classical concept of light [38,39] quantum ﬂuctu-
ations are small perturbations of the classical amplitude
and are subject to a linear theory. If the vacuum state
of light is classically unstable, photons are created spon-
taneously. For example, in parametric downconversion
[20] quantum ﬂuctuations are ampliﬁed [38], generating
photon pairs. The instability of the linear optics near
a slow-light horizon may provide the microscopic mech-
anism for the pair production we have predicted phe-
nomenologically. However, the non-linear eﬀects of the
EIT medium are required to dominate at a stage where
the absorption is still small. We show in Appendix B
that the probe intensity is proportional to the detuning
δ0 given by Eq. (65) in terms of the characteristic scale
(31) of the group index proﬁle (2). Therefore, the ra-
tio of the control and probe intensities does not depend
on a, and, consequently, the non-linearity distance z0 is
independent of the control-ﬁeld gradient.
In order to
avoid absorption the control should be strong enough at
z0 which requires a steep ﬁeld gradient. Using the exper-
imental parameters of Refs. [12,14], the Rabi frequency
[20] of the control ﬁeld should grow at least by 10MHz

11

per wave length λ0 in distance from the horizon, as we
103λ0
show in Appendix B. In this case the scale a = 5
and the critical detuning δ0 = 10−10. Appendix B in-
dicates that millions of photons are generated per sec-
ond, amounting to a gentle glow perhaps visible with the
naked eye.

IV. SUMMARY

Tuning the control ﬁeld towards a parabolic intensity
proﬁle causes a catastrophic situation for slow-light po-
laritons. In turn, the polariton ﬁeld sets out to deplete
the control beam, in an attempt to alter the intensity
proﬁle that has caused the wave catastrophe in the ﬁrst
place, yet in vain. The control beam continuously replen-
ishes the parabolic intensity proﬁle, driving a stationary
production of polariton pairs. The two polaritons of each
pair are created on opposite sides near the horizon, they
depart at a snail’s pace, accelerate gradually and emerge
as detectable photons. The Hawking radiation of a black
hole [9] follows a similar scenario [7]. Here the gravita-
tional collapse [6] has triggered a quantum catastrophe at
the event horizon, causing pair creation lasting as long as
the hole possesses gravitational energy [7,9]. One particle
of each pair falls into the black hole, whereas the other
escapes into space and appears as thermal radiation [9].
In our case, and in contrast to gravitational holes, one
can explore the other side beyond the horizon and, for
example, measure the correlations of the generated pho-
ton pairs. Both cases are triggered by catastrophic events
with lasting consequences.

The quantum radiation of a slow-light catastrophe re-
sembles Hawking radiation but also exhibits some in-
teresting diﬀerences. The emitted spectrum (64) is not
Planckian, whereas a black hole of Schwarzschild radius
rs appears as a black-body radiator with temperature
¯hc/(4πrs) [9]. The diﬀerences between the two spectra
can be traced back to two diﬀerent classes of wave catas-

the form ζp with an exponent iµ + 1/2 for slow-light
media but with an exponent iµ for black holes where
µ = 2πrs ω/c [7]. Note that Unruh’s eﬀect [8] of ra-
diation seen by an accelerated observer is of Hawking-
class as well [7] and so are most of the proposed artiﬁcial
black holes [23,36,37,40–42]. Remarkably, Schwinger’s
pair production of charged particles in electrostatic ﬁelds
[43] is accompanied by a subtle wave catastrophe of expo-
1/2 [7] and leads to a Boltzmannian spectrum

¯n = exp(
2πµ). All three catastrophes agree in the limit

of large µ but deviate signiﬁcantly in the regime of max-
imal particle production where µ is small. It might be
interesting to ﬁnd out whether Nature oﬀers more than
the three quantum catastrophes.

APPENDIX A: DARK-STATE DYNAMICS

In this appendix we consider the microscopic theory
of the atoms constituting an EIT medium. We derive
the wave equation (5) as the linear-response limit of the
non-linear dynamics of slow light. Assume that the EIT
medium consists of nA identical atoms per unit volume,
each one equipped with three levels interacting near-
resonantly with the probe and control ﬁelds respectively,
see Fig. 3.

FIG. 3. Three-level atom in a regime of Electromagnet-
ically-Induced Transparency. The control beam couples the
levels 2 and 3, which inﬂuences strongly the optical properties
of the atom for a weaker probe beam tuned to the transition
1↔3.

We treat the light as a classical electromagnetic ﬁeld.
An atom is characterized by the energy-level diﬀerences
ω0. Typically, the
¯hω12 and ¯hω23 with ω12 + ω23 = ω13 ≡
transition frequencies ω13 and ω23 are in the optical range
of the spectrum or in the near infrared (1015Hz), whereas
the frequency ω12 is much lower (109Hz). The atom is
subject to fast relaxation mechanisms (106Hz) that trans-
1
port atomic excitations from the
i
i
, mainly caused by spontaneous emis-
and from
i
sion. Hardly any excitations move from
, be-
i
cause the spontaneous emission rate is proportional to
the cube of the frequency [44]. Here the relaxation may
be dominated by other processes, for instance by spin-
exchanging collisions. Without relaxation the dynamics
of the atom is governed by the Hamiltonian

Consequently, the vector (75) describes correctly the dy-
namics of the atom in the lower-level subspace. There-
fore, the atom remains in the dark state (75), as long

as the atom’s evolution never leads to an overpopulation
at the top level
. The initial relaxation-dominated
i
regime has prepared the dark state, but later the atom
follows dynamically without relaxation [17].

In responding to the light ﬁelds, the evolving atoms
constitute a macroscopic dipole density called the matter
polarization PA. Consider a one-dimensional model for
light propagation. The matter polarization inﬂuences the

Otherwise we can easily incorporate the phase θc of the

The dark-state dynamics may lead to a non-linear sat-

We have derived the wave equation (5). The group in-
dex (81) determines the group velocity vg = c/(1 + α).
Remarkably, the lower the intensity of the control beam
is, the slower the probe light becomes. Taken to the ex-
treme, light freezes when the control light is switched
oﬀ — a paradoxical behavior that is only possible in a
dynamical regime [17]: a control beam of moderate in-
tensity ﬁrst captures the probe light, slowing it down,
and then, by ramping down the control intensity, freezes
the probe pulse. Equally paradoxically, the non-linearity
of the EIT medium is stronger the weaker the control
beam is. We show in Appendix B that the unusual non-
linear optics in an EIT medium matters in a slow-light
catastrophe.

APPENDIX B: ESTIMATIONS

In this appendix we estimate the eﬀect of a slow-light
catastrophe, using the experimental parameters of Refs.
[12,14]. We calculate the photon ﬂux in the far ﬁeld
In order
and estimate the intensity near the horizon.
to detect experimentally the quantum radiation of the
catastrophe, the ﬂux should be suﬃciently strong. Close
to the horizon, even slightly detuned slow light leaves
the absorption-less transparency window of EIT, unless
the medium becomes non-linear. The intensity near the
horizon determines whether the non-linearity or the ab-
sorption dominates.

First we generalize our one-dimensional model of the
slow-light catastrophe to the three dimensions of space in
Cartesian coordinates x = (x, y, z). The spatial proﬁle of
the group index shall be uniform in x and y and parabolic
in z with the scale a. The propagation of slow light is
governed by the wave equation

For light in the optical spectral range, 2πω0 η0 is about
1014Hz. Assuming a critical detuning δ0 of 10−10
4
a surface of 102λ0 could generate millions of photons
per second. Usually a photodetector captures only a
small solid angle of the radiation emitted from a local-
ized source, and a detector is not perfectly eﬃcient in

(88)

14

counting all photons. Yet the radiation of the slow-light
catastrophe seems to be strong enough to be detectable.
Let us estimate the strength of the control ﬁeld needed
to generate the ﬂux we have calculated. We calibrate the
ﬁeld strength in terms of a Rabi frequency (69). Ac-
cording to Eq. (65), a critical detuning δ0 of 10−10 cor-
103λ0 of the group-
responds to a length scale a
index proﬁle (31). In the experiment [12] a group index
of 107 is generated by a control ﬁeld with Rabi frequency
16MHz. The group index is in-
Ωc = 2.57
versely proportional to Ω2
c , which leads to a Rabi fre-
104√α MHz. For the proﬁle (31)
quency Ωc of about 5
of our slow-light catastrophe we ﬁnd that Ωc should grow
linearly by 10MHz per wave-length distance away from
the horizon,

Probably 10 to 100 wave lengths are suﬃcient to establish
the wave catastrophe. This would take a continuous-wave
control ﬁeld with a maximal Rabi frequency of 102 to
103MHz.

The ratio Ωp/Ωc of the Rabi frequencies (69) deter-
mines whether non-linear eﬀects dominate near the hori-
zon. We calculate Ωp using the results of the linear the-
ory. Strictly speaking, Rabi frequencies refer to classical
ﬁelds. Here we regard the time-averaged and normally
ordered expectation value of the quantum intensity ˆE2
p
as being proportional to Ω2
p. Comparing Eq. (1) of Ref.
[14] with our Eq. (81) we ﬁnd a relation between the Rabi
frequency and the intensity,

Therefore, the Rabi frequencies Ωp and Ωc are compara-
ble at about half a wave-length distance away from the
horizon. Here a critical detuning of 10−10 lies still within
the transparency window generated by a control ﬁeld of
5MHz Rabi frequency. The EIT medium becomes non-
linear.

Frozen light in photonic crystals with degenerate
band edge

Alex Figotin and Ilya Vitebskiy

Abstract. Consider a plane monochromatic wave incident on a semi-inﬁnite
periodic structure. What happens if the normal component of the transmitted
wave group velocity vanishes? At ﬁrst sight, zero normal component of the
transmitted wave group velocity simply implies total reﬂection of the incident
wave. But we demonstrate that total reﬂection is not the only possible outcome.
Instead, the transmitted wave can appear in the form of a frozen mode with very
large diverging amplitude and either zero, or purely tangential energy ﬂux. The
ﬁeld amplitude in the transmitted wave can exceed that of the incident wave by
several orders of magnitude. There are two qualitatively diﬀerent kinds of frozen
mode regime. The ﬁrst one is associated with a stationary inﬂection point of
electromagnetic dispersion relation. This phenomenon has been analyzed in our
previous publications. Now, our focus is on the frozen mode regime related to a
degenerate photonic band edge. An advantage of this new phenomenon is that it
can occur in much simpler periodic structures. This spectacular eﬀect is extremely
sensitive to the frequency and direction of propagation of the incident plane wave.
These features can be very attractive in a variety practical applications, such
as higher harmonic generation and wave mixing, light ampliﬁcation and lasing,
highly eﬃcient superprizms, etc.

1. Introduction

Wave propagation in spatially periodic media, such as photonic crystals, can be
qualitatively diﬀerent from any uniform substance. The diﬀerences are particularly
pronounced when the wavelength is comparable to the primitive translation L of the
periodic structure [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The eﬀects of strong spatial dispersion culminate
when the group velocity u = ∂ω/∂k of a traveling Bloch wave vanishes. One reason for
this is that vanishing group velocity always implies a dramatic increase in density of
modes at the respective frequency. In addition, vanishing group velocity also implies
certain qualitative changes in the eigenmode structure, which can be accompanied by
some spectacular eﬀects in electromagnetic wave propagation. A particular example
of the kind is the frozen mode regime associated with a dramatic enhancement of the
wave transmitted to the periodic medium [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. There are at least
two qualitatively diﬀerent modiﬁcations of the frozen mode regime, each related to
a speciﬁc singularity of the electromagnetic dispersion relation. Both eﬀects can be
explained using the simple example of a plane electromagnetic wave normally incident
on a lossless semi-inﬁnite periodic structure, as shown in Fig. 1.

subscripts I, R, and T refer to the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves,
respectively. In all cases, the amplitude of the incident wave is unity.

The frozen mode regime of the ﬁrst kind is associated with a stationary inﬂection
point on the k − ω diagram shown in Fig. 2(b). In the vicinity of stationary inﬂection
point, the relation between the frequency ω and the Bloch wave number k can be
approximated as

ω − ω0 ∝ (k − k0)3 .
A monochromatic plane wave of frequency close to ω0 incident on semi-inﬁnite
photonic crystal is converted into the frozen mode with inﬁnitesimal group velocity
and dramatically enhanced amplitude, as illustrated in Fig. 3. The saturation value
of the frozen mode amplitude diverges as the frequency approaches its critical value
ω0. Remarkably, the photonic crystal reﬂectivity at ω = ω0 can be very low, implying

that the incident radiation is almost totally converted into the frozen mode with zero
group velocity, diverging amplitude, and ﬁnite energy ﬂux close to that of the incident
wave [9, 10, 11]. Of course, in reality, the amplitude of the frozen mode will be limited
by such factors as absorption, nonlinear eﬀects, imperfection of the periodic dielectric
array, deviation of the incident radiation from a perfect plane monochromatic wave,
ﬁniteness of the photonic crystal dimensions, etc. Still, with all these limitations
in place, the frozen mode regime can be very attractive for a variety of practical
applications.

A qualitatively diﬀerent kind of frozen mode regime occurs in the vicinity of a
degenerate photonic band edge shown in Fig. 2(c). This case is the main subject of
this paper. At frequencies just below ωd in Fig. 2(c), the dispersion relation can be
approximated as

ωd − ω ∝ (k − kd)4 , at ω / ωd.

(2)

Contrary to the previous case (1), at frequencies close to a degenerate band edge, the
photonic crystal becomes totally reﬂective. At ω ≥ ωd (inside the band gap), the
energy ﬂux of transmitted wave vanishes completely. In spite of this, in the steady
state regime, electromagnetic ﬁled inside the periodic medium (at z > 0) has a very
large amplitude, diverging as the frequency approaches its critical value ωd. Such
a behavior is illustrated in Fig. 4. The frozen mode proﬁle below and above the
degenerate band edge frequency ωd is diﬀerent.
It has a large saturation value at
frequencies located inside the transmission band (at ω ≤ ωd), as seen in Fig. 4(a –
b). This saturation value diverges as ω → ωd − 0. By contrast, at frequencies inside
the band gap (at ω > ωd), the ﬁeld amplitude initially increases dramatically with the
distance z from the surface, but then vanishes as the distance z further increases, as
seen in Fig. 4(d – f).

Not every periodic structure can support the frozen mode regime at normal
incidence. Generally, the physical conditions for the frozen mode regime are the
same as the conditions for the existence of the respective stationary point (1) or (2)
of the dispersion relation. In either case, a unit cell of the periodic layered structure
must contain at least three layers, of which two must display a misaligned in-plane
anisotropy, as shown in Fig. 5. The diﬀerence, though, is that a stationary inﬂection

point (1) also required the presence of magnetic layers with strong nonreciprocal
circular birefringence [8, 9]. No magnetic layers are needed for a degenerate band
edge (2), which constitutes a major practical advantage of the respective frozen mode
regime.
In photonic crystals with three dimensional periodicity, the presence of
anisotropic constitutive component may not be necessary. A detailed comparative
analysis of the above two modiﬁcations of the frozen mode regime at normal incidence
is carried out in the next section. The emphasis is on the physical conditions under
which these phenomena can occur.

In Section 3, we turn to the case of oblique wave propagation. The frozen mode
regime at oblique incidence can occur when the normal component of the transmitted

In transmission band (at ω < ωd), the asymptotic ﬁeld value diverges as ω → ωd.
By contrast, in the band gap (at ω > ωd), the asymptotic ﬁeld value is zero.

wave group velocity vanishes, while its tangential component remains ﬁnite. In such a
case, the transmitted wave is an abnormal grazing mode with a dramatically enhanced
amplitude and nearly tangential energy ﬂux. A signiﬁcant advantage of the oblique
modiﬁcation of the frozen mode regime is that it can occur in much simpler periodic
structures, compared to those supporting the frozen mode regime at normal incidence.
Examples are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The presence of anisotropic layers is still
required.

Yet another interesting modiﬁcation of the frozen mode regime is an abnormal
subsurface wave in the vicinity of a degenerate photonic band edge. A regular
surface wave usually decays exponentially with the distance from the surface in either

Frozen light in photonic crystals with degenerate band edge

6

direction. By contrast, the abnormal subsurface wave is extremely asymmetric. It
does decay rapidly outside the photonic crystal. But inside the periodic medium, its
amplitude sharply increases, and reaches its maximum at a certain distance from the
surface. Only after that the ﬁeld amplitude begins a slow decay, as the distance from
the surface further increases. The proﬁle of such a subsurface wave is similar to that
of the frozen mode in the vicinity of a degenerate band edge, as shown in Fig. 4(d –
f). This phenomenon is brieﬂy discussed in section 4.

In Section 5 we discuss the physical requirements to the spatially periodic arrays
capable of supporting the frozen mode regime, both at normal and oblique incidence.
We also present a detailed description of the periodic layered structures used in our
numerical simulations.

Finally,

in Section 6 we summarize the results and discuss some physical

limitations of the frozen mode regime.

misalignment angle φ = ϕ1 − ϕ2 between adjacent anisotropic layers A1 and A2
must be diﬀerent from 0 and π/2. A detailed description of this periodic structure
is given in the Section 5.

2. The physical nature of the frozen mode regime

The essence of the frozen mode regime can be understood from the simple example
of a plane monochromatic wave normally incident on a semi-inﬁnite periodic layered
structure, as shown in Fig. 1. An important requirement, though, is that some of
the layers display a misaligned in-plane anisotropy as shown in the example in Fig. 5.
Below we present a comparative analysis of two diﬀerent kinds of frozen mode regime.
Although throughout this section we only consider the case of normal incidence, in
the next section we will show that most of the results and expressions remain virtually
unchanged in a more general case of the frozen mode regime at oblique propagation.
One diﬀerence, though, is that at oblique incidence, the frozen mode regime can occur
in much simpler structures. This can have a big advantage in practical terms.

To start with, let us introduce some basic notations and deﬁnitions. Let ΨI , ΨR,
and ΨT be the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves, respectively. Assume for now
that all three monochromatic waves propagate along the z axis normal to the surface
of semi-inﬁnite periodic layered structure in Fig. 1. Electromagnetic ﬁeld both inside
(at z > 0) and outside (at z < 0) the periodic stack is independent of the x and y
coordinates. The transverse ﬁeld components can be represented as a column-vector

where ~E (z) and ~H (z) are time-harmonic electric and magnetic ﬁelds. All four
transverse ﬁeld components in (3) are continuous functions of z, which leads to the
following standard boundary condition at z = 0

ΨT (0) = ΨI (0) + ΨR (0) .

Assume also that anisotropic layers of the periodic array have an in-plane
anisotropy (69), in which case the ﬁelds ~E (z) and ~H (z) are normal to the direction
of propagation

~E (z) ⊥ z, ~H (z) ⊥ z,

and the column vector (3) includes all nonzero ﬁeld components. Note that the
polarizations of the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves can be diﬀerent, because
some of the layers of the periodic array display an in-plane anisotropy, as shown in the
example in Fig. 5. The presence of anisotropic layers is essential for the possibility of
the frozen mode regime.

In periodic layered media, the electromagnetic eigenmodes Ψk (z) are usually

chosen in the Bloch form

Ψk (z + L) = eikLΨk (z) ,

where the Bloch wavenumber k is deﬁned up to a multiple of 2π/L.
The
correspondence between ω and k is referred to as the Bloch dispersion relation. Real
k correspond to propagating (traveling) Bloch modes. Propagating modes belong to
diﬀerent spectral branches ω (k) separated by frequency gaps. The speed of a traveling
wave in a periodic medium is determined by the group velocity [4]

u = dω/dk.

Normally, each spectral branch ω (k) develops stationary points ωs = ω (ks) where the
group velocity (7) of the corresponding propagating mode vanishes

dω/dk = 0, at ω = ωs = ω (ks) .

Examples of diﬀerent stationary points are shown in Fig.
2, where each of the
frequencies ωg, ω0 and ωd is associated with zero group velocity of the respective
traveling wave. Stationary points (7) play essential role in the formation of frozen
mode regime.

By contrast, evanescent Bloch modes are characterized by complex wavenumbers
k = k′ + ik′′. Evanescent modes decay exponentially with the distance z from the
boundary of semi-inﬁnite periodic structure. Therefore, under normal circumstances,

Frozen light in photonic crystals with degenerate band edge

evanescent contribution to the transmitted wave ΨT (z) can be signiﬁcant only in close
proximity of the surface. The situation can change dramatically when the frequency ω
approaches one of the stationary point values ωs. At ﬁrst sight, stationary points (8)
relate only to propagating Bloch modes. But in fact, in the vicinity of every stationary
point frequency ωs, the imaginary part k′′ of the Bloch wavenumber of at least one of
the evanescent modes also vanishes. As a consequence, the respective evanescent mode
decays very slowly, and its role may extend far beyond the photonic crystal boundary.
In addition, in the special cases of interest, the electromagnetic ﬁeld distributionΨ (z)
in the coexisting evanescent and propagating eigenmodes becomes very similar, as ω
approaches ωs. This can result in spectacular resonance eﬀects, such as the frozen
mode regime. What exactly happens in the vicinity of a particular stationary point
(8) essentially depends on its character and appears to be very diﬀerent in each of the
three cases presented in Fig. 2.

In the next subsection we present a simple qualitative picture of the frozen
mode regime based solely on energy conservation consideration. This will allow us
to highlight the diﬀerence between the cases of stationary inﬂection point (1) and
degenerate band edge (2). Then, we discuss the physical nature of the frozen mode
regime.

2.1. Energy density and energy ﬂux at frozen mode regime

Let SI , SR and ST be the energy ﬂux in the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves
in Fig. 1. The transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients of a lossless semi-inﬁnite medium
are deﬁned as

where

τ =

, ρ = −

ST
SI

SR
SI

,

SI + SR = ST , ρ = 1 − τ .

With certain reservations, the energy ﬂux ST of the transmitted travelling wave can
be expressed as

(9)

(10)

where u is the group velocity, which is also the energy velocity, and WT is the energy
density

ST = WT u,

WT ∝ |ΨT |2 .

Evanescent modes do not contribute to the normal energy ﬂux ST in the case of
a lossless semi-inﬁnite periodic structure. Besides, evanescent contribution to the
transmitted wave becomes negligible at a certain distance z from the surface. The
simple expression (10) may not apply when the transmitted wave involves two or
more propagating Bloch modes, but we will not deal with such a situation here.

Vanishing group velocity u in (10) implies that the transmitted wave energy ﬂux
ST also vanishes, along with the respective transmission coeﬃcient τ in (9). The
only exception could be if the energy density WT of the transmitted wave increases
dramatically in the vicinity of the stationary point frequency. In other words, if WT
in (10) grows fast enough, as ω approaches ωs, the product WT u in (10) can remain
ﬁnite even at ω = ωs. In such a case, a signiﬁcant fraction of the incident radiation
can be converted into the slow mode inside the semi-inﬁnite periodic array. The eﬀect
of a dramatic growth of the transmitted wave amplitude in the vicinity of a stationary
point (8) will be referred to as the frozen mode regime. The possibility of such an

Frozen light in photonic crystals with degenerate band edge

10

eﬀect is directly related to the character of a particular stationary point. From this
point of view, let us consider three diﬀerent situation presented in Fig. 2.

2.1.1. Regular band edge We start with the simplest case of a regular photonic band
edge (RBE) shown in Fig. 2(a). It can be found in any periodic array, including any
periodic layered structure. Just below the band edge frequency ωg, the dispersion
relation can be approximated by a quadratic parabola

ωg − ω ∝ (k − kg)2 , at ω / ωg.

This yields the following frequency dependence of the propagating mode group velocity
u inside the transmission band

u =

dω
dk

∝ (kg − k) ∝ (ωg − ω)1/2 , at ω / ωg.

Due to the boundary condition (4), the amplitude of the transmitted propagating
Bloch mode remains ﬁnite and comparable to that of the incident wave. Therefore, the
energy ﬂux (10) associated with the transmitted slow mode vanishes, as ω approaches
ωg

ST = WT u ∝

(ωg − ω)1/2 , at ω / ωg
0, at ω ≥ ωg

(cid:26)

.

Formula (13) expresses the well-known fact that in the vicinity of a regular photonic
band edge, a lossless semi-inﬁnite photonic crystal becomes totally reﬂective.

2.1.2. Stationary inﬂection point A completely diﬀerent situation occurs in the
vicinity of a stationary inﬂection point shown in Fig. 2(b). Such a point can be found
in periodic layered structures involving anisotropic and magnetic layers [8, 9], as well
as in some photonic crystals with 2- and 3-dimensional periodicity. In the vicinity of a
stationary inﬂection point ω0, the dispersion relation can be approximated by a cubic
parabola (1). The propagating mode group velocity u vanishes as ω approaches ω0
from either direction

u =

dω
dk

∝ (k − k0)2 ∝ (ω − ω0)2/3 .

But remarkably, the amplitude of the transmitted propagating mode increases so that
the respective energy density WT diverges as ω → ω0

The expression (14) together with (15) yield that the energy ﬂux of the transmitted
slow mode remains ﬁnite even at ω = ω0

WT ∝ (ω − ω0)−2/3 .

ST = WT u ∼ SI , at ω ≈ ω0.

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

The latter implies that the incident light is converted to the frozen mode with
inﬁnitesimal group velocity (14) and diverging amplitude (15). This result was ﬁrst
reported in [9]. A consistent analytical description of the asymptotic behavior of the
transmitted ﬁeld amplitude in the vicinity of a stationary inﬂection point was carried
out in [13].

Frozen light in photonic crystals with degenerate band edge

11

2.1.3. Degenerate band edge Let us turn to the case of a degenerate band edge shown
in Fig. 2(c). Such a point can be found in dispersion relation of periodic layered
structures involving misaligned anisotropic layers. An example is shown in Fig. 5.
Just below the degenerate band edge frequency ωd, the dispersion relation ω (k) can
be approximated by a biquadratic parabola (2). This yields the following frequency
dependence of the propagating mode group velocity inside the transmission band

u =

dω
dk

∝ (kd − k)3 ∝ (ωd − ω)3/4 , at ω / ωd.

Analysis shows that the amplitude of the transmitted slow mode in this case diverges,
as the frequency approaches the band edge value

WT ∝ |ωd − ω|−1/2 ,

at ω / ωDBE,

which constitutes the frozen mode regime. But the energy density (18) does not grow
fast enough to oﬀset the vanishing group velocity (17). Indeed, the expressions (17)
and (18) together with (10) yield for the energy ﬂux

(17)

(18)

(19)

ST = WT u ∝

(ωd − ω)1/4 , at ω / ωd
0, at ω ≥ ωd

(cid:26)

,

implying that, in spite of the diverging energy density (18), the energy ﬂux of the
transmitted slow wave vanishes, as ω approaches ωd.

The situation at a degenerate band edge (2) can be viewed as intermediate
between the frozen mode regime at a stationary inﬂection point (1), and the vicinity
of a regular band edge (11). Indeed, on the one hand, the incident wave at ω = ωd
is totally reﬂected back to space, as is the case at a regular band edge. On the other
hand, the transmitted ﬁeld amplitude inside the periodic medium diverges as ω → ωd,
which is similar to what occurs at a stationary inﬂection point.

The above consideration does not explain the nature of the frozen mode regime,
nor does it address the problem of the Bloch composition of the frozen mode. All
these questions are the subject of the next subsection.

2.2. Bloch composition of frozen mode

In a periodic layered structure, at any given frequency ω, there are four electromagnetic
eigenmodes with diﬀerent polarizations and wavenumbers. But in the setting of Fig.
1 where the semi-inﬁnite periodic array occupies the half-space z ≥ 0, the transmitted
wave is a superposition of only two of the four Bloch eigenmodes. Indeed, neither the
propagating modes with negative group velocity, nor evanescent modes exponentially
growing with the distance z from the surface, contribute to ΨT (z) in this case.
Generally, one can distinguish three diﬀerent possibilities.

(i) Both Bloch components of the transmitted wave ΨT are propagating modes

ΨT (z) = Ψpr1 (z) + Ψpr2 (z) , z ≥ 0.

(20)

The transmitted wave ΨT in (20) is composed of two Bloch eigenmodes with two
diﬀerent real wavenumbers k1 and k2 and two diﬀerent group velocities u1 > 0
and u2 > 0. This constitutes the phenomenon of double refraction, provided that
u1 and u2 are diﬀerent. The other two Bloch components of the same frequency
have negative group velocities and cannot contribute to the transmitted wave ΨT .

Frozen light in photonic crystals with degenerate band edge

(ii) Both Bloch components of ΨT are evanescent

ΨT (z) = Ψev1 (z) + Ψev2 (z) , z ≥ 0.

12

(21)

The respective two values of k are complex with positive imaginary parts k′′ > 0.
This is the case when the frequency ω falls into photonic band gap at ω > ωg
in Fig. 2(a) or at ω > ωd in Fig. 2(c). The fact that k′′ > 0 implies that the
wave amplitude decays with the distance z from the surface of the semi-inﬁnite
photonic crystal. In the case (21), the incident wave is totally reﬂected back to
space by the semi-inﬁnite periodic structure.

(iii) One of the Bloch components of the transmitted wave ΨT is a propagating mode

with u > 0, while the other is an evanescent mode with k′′ > 0

ΨT (z) = Ψpr (z) + Ψev (z) , z ≥ 0.

(22)

For example, this is the case at ω ∼ ω0 in Fig. 2(b), as well as at ω < ωg in Fig.
2(a) and at ω < ωd in Fig. 2(c). As the distance z from the surface increases,
the evanescent contribution Ψev in (22) decays as exp (−zk′′), and the resulting
transmitted wave ΨT (z) turns into a single propagating Bloch mode Ψpr.

Propagating modes with u < 0, as well as evanescent modes with k′′ < 0, never
contribute to the transmitted wave ΨT inside the semi-inﬁnite stack in Fig. 1. This
statement is based on the following two assumptions:

- The transmitted wave ΨT and the reﬂected wave ΨR are originated from the
plane wave ΨI incident on the semi-inﬁnite photonic slab from the left, as shown
in Fig. 1.

- The layered array in Fig. 1 occupies the entire half-space and is perfectly periodic

at z > 0.

If either of the above conditions is violated, the electromagnetic ﬁeld inside the
periodic stack can be a superposition of four Bloch eigenmodes with either sign of
the group velocity u of propagating contributions, or either sign of k′′ of evanescent
contributions. For example, this would be the case if the periodic layered array in Fig.
1 had some kind of structural defects or a ﬁnite thickness. The propagating modes
with u > 0 and evanescent modes with k′′ > 0 are referred to as forward waves. Only
forward modes contribute to the transmitted wave ΨT (z) in the case of a periodic
semi-inﬁnite stack. The propagating modes with u < 0 and evanescent modes with
k′′ < 0 are referred to as backward waves. Since the backward Bloch waves are not
excited in the setting of Fig. 1, they play no role in further consideration.

Note that the assumption that the transmitted wave ΨT (z) is a superposition
of propagating and/or evanescent Bloch eigenmodes may not apply if the frequency
ω exactly coincides with one of the stationary point frequencies (8). For example, at
frequency ω0 of stationary inﬂection point (1), there are no evanescent solutions to the
Maxwell equations (54), and the transmitted wave ΨT (z) is a (non-Bloch) Floquet
eigenmode linearly growing with z [9, 10]. Similar situation occurs at frequency ωd
of degenerate band edge (2). The term ”non-Bloch” means that the respective ﬁeld
distribution does not comply with the relation (6). At the same time, at any general
frequency, including the vicinity of any stationary point (8), the transmitted wave
ΨT (z) is a superposition of two Bloch eigenmodes, each of which is either propagating,
or evanescent.

13

In all three cases (20 – 22), the contribution of a particular Bloch eigenmode to
the transmitted wave ΨT depends on the polarization ΨI of the incident wave. One
can always choose some special incident wave polarization, such that only one of the
two forward Bloch modes is excited and the transmitted wave ΨT is a single Bloch
eigenmode. In the next subsection we will see that there is no frozen mode regime in
the case of a single mode excitation. This fact relates to the very nature of the frozen
mode regime.

Knowing the Bloch composition of the transmitted wave we can give a semi-
qualitative description of what happens when the frequency ω of the incident wave
approaches one of the stationary points (8) in Fig. 2.

2.2.1. Regular photonic band edge We start with the simplest case of a regular
photonic band edge. There are two diﬀerent possibilities in this case, but none of
them is associated with the frozen mode regime. The ﬁrst one relates to the trivial
case where none of the layers of the periodic structure displays an in-plane anisotropy
or gyrotropy. As the result, all eigenmodes are doubly degenerate with respect to
polarization. A detailed description of this case can be found in the extensive literature
on optics of stratiﬁed media [2, 3]. Slightly diﬀerent scenario occurs if some of the
layers are anisotropic or gyrotropic and, as a result, the polarization degeneracy is
lifted. Just below the band edge frequency ωg in Fig. 2(a), the transmitted ﬁeld
ΨT (z) is a superposition (22) of one propagating and one evanescent Bloch modes.
Due to the boundary condition (4), the amplitude of the transmitted wave at z = 0 is
comparable to that of the incident wave. In the case of a generic polarization of the
incident light, the amplitudes of the propagating and evanescent Bloch components
at z = 0 are also comparable to each other and to the amplitude of the incident light

|Ψpr (0)| ∼ |Ψev (0)| ∼ |ΨI| , at ω ≤ ωg.

(23)

As the distance z from the surface increases, the evanescent component Ψev (z)
decays rapidly, while the amplitude of the propagating component remains constant.
Eventually, at a certain distance from the slab surface, the transmitted wave ΨT (z)
becomes very close to the propagating mode

ΨT (z) ≈ Ψpr (z) , at z ≫ L, ω ≤ ωg.

(24)

The evanescent component Ψev of the transmitted wave does not display any
singularity at the band edge frequency ωg. The propagating mode Ψpr does develop a
singularity associated with vanishing group velocity at ω → ωg − 0, but its amplitude
remains ﬁnite and comparable to that of the incident wave. At ω > ωg, this
propagating mode turns into another evanescent mode in (21). The bottom line is that
none of the Bloch components of the transmitted wave develops a large amplitude in
the vicinity of a regular photonic band edge. There is no frozen mode regime in this
trivial case.

2.2.2. Stationary inﬂection point A completely diﬀerent situation develops in the
vicinity of a stationary inﬂection point (1) of the dispersion relation. At ω ≈ ω0, the
transmitted wave ΨT is a superposition (22) of one propagating and one evanescent
Bloch component.
In contrast to the case of a regular photonic band edge, in the
vicinity of ω0 both Bloch contributions to ΨT develop strong singularity. Speciﬁcally,

Frozen light in photonic crystals with degenerate band edge

as the frequency ω approaches ω0, both contributions grow dramatically, while
remaining nearly equal and opposite in sign at the slab boundary [9]

Ψpr (0) ≈ −Ψev (0) ∝ |ω − ω0|−1/3 , as ω → ω0.

Due to the destructive interference (25), the resulting ﬁeld

ΨT (0) = Ψpr (0) + Ψev (0)

at the surface at z = 0 is small enough to satisfy the boundary condition (4). As the
distance z from the slab boundary increases, the destructive interference becomes less
eﬀective – in part because the evanescent contribution decays exponentially

Ψev (z) ≈ Ψev (0) exp (−zk′′) ,

(26)

while the amplitude of the propagating contribution remains constant and very
large. Eventually, the transmitted wave ΨT (z) reaches its large saturation value
corresponding to its propagating component Ψpr, as seen in Fig. 8.

Note that the imaginary part k′′ of the evanescent mode wavenumber in (26) also

vanishes in the vicinity of stationary inﬂection point

k′′ ∝ |ω − ω0|1/3 , as ω → ω0,

reducing the rate of decay of the evanescent contribution (26). As a consequence, the
resulting amplitude ΨT (z) of the transmitted wave reaches its large saturation value
Ψpr in (25) only at a certain distance Z from the surface. This characteristic distance
increases as the frequency approaches its critical value ω0

Z ∝ 1/k′′ ∝ |ω − ω0|−1/3 .

If the frequency of the incident wave is exactly equal to the frozen mode frequency
ω0, the transmitted wave ΨT (z) does not reduce to the sum (22) of propagating
and evanescent contributions, because at ω = ω0, there is no evanescent solutions
to the Maxwell equations (54). Instead, ΨT (z) corresponds to a non-Bloch Floquet
eigenmode diverging linearly with z [9].

ΨT (z) − ΨT (0) ∝ zΨ0, at ω = ω0.

2.2.3. Degenerate band edge While the situation with a regular photonic band edge
(11) appears trivial, the case of a degenerate band edge (2) proves to be quite diﬀerent.
Just below the degenerate band edge frequency ωd (inside the transmission band),
the transmitted ﬁeld is a superposition (22) of one propagating and one evanescent
components. Above ωd (inside the band gap), the transmitted wave is a combination
(21) of two evanescent components. In this respect, the regular and degenerate band
edges are similar to each other. A crucial diﬀerence, though, is that in the vicinity of
a degenerate band edge, both Bloch contributions to the transmitted wave diverge as
ω approaches ωd, which constitutes the frozen mode regime.

Let us start with the transmission band at ω < ωd. As the frequency ω approaches
ωd − 0, both Bloch contributions in (22) grow sharply, while remaining nearly equal
and opposite in sign at the surface

Ψpr (0) ≈ −Ψev (0) ∝ |ωd − ω|−1/4 , as ω → ωd − 0.

Figure 8. Destructive interference of the propagating and evanescent components
of the transmitted wave inside semi-inﬁnite photonic crystal. The frequency is
close but not equal to that of stationary inﬂection point. (a) The squared modulus
of the resulting transmitted ﬁeld – its amplitude at z = 0 is small enough to
satisfy the boundary conditions (4); (b) the squared modulus of the propagating
contribution, which is independent of z; (c) the squared modulus of the evanescent
contribution, which decays with the distance z. The amplitude of the incident
wave is unity. The distance z from the surface is expressed in units of L.

The destructive interference (30) ensures that the boundary condition (4) can be
satisﬁed, while both Bloch contributions to ΨT (z) diverge. As the distance z from
the slab boundary increases, the evanescent component Ψev (z) dies out

Ψev (z) ≈ Ψev (0) exp (−zk′′)

(31)

while the propagating component Ψpr (z) remains constant and very large. Eventually,
as the distance z further increases, the transmitted wave ΨT (z) reaches its large
saturation value corresponding to its propagating component Ψpr (z), as illustrated
in Fig. 9. Note that the imaginary part k′′ of the evanescent mode wavenumber also
vanishes in the vicinity of degenerate band edge

k′′ ∝ |ω − ωd|1/4 , as ω → ωd,

(32)

(33)

reducing the rate of decay of the evanescent contribution (31). As a consequence,
the resulting amplitude ΨT (z) of the transmitted wave reaches its large saturation
value Ψpr only at a certain distance Z from the surface. This characteristic distance
increases as the frequency approaches its critical value ωd

Z ∝ 1/k′′ ∝ |ω − ωd|−1/4 ,

as illustrated in Fig. 4(a) and (b). If the frequency ω of the incident wave is exactly
equal to ωd, the transmitted wave ΨT (z) does not reduce to the sum of two Bloch
contributions.
Instead, it corresponds to a non-Bloch Floquet eigenmode linearly
diverging with z

ΨT (z) − ΨT (0) ∝ zΨd, at ω = ωd.

(34)

This situation is shown in Fig. 4(c).

The above behavior appears to be very similar to that of the frozen mode regime
at a stationary inﬂection point, shown in Fig. 8. Yet, there is a crucial diﬀerence

Frozen light in photonic crystals with degenerate band edge

16

between the two cases. According to (19), in the immediate proximity of a degenerate
band edge, the Pointing vector ST of the transmitted wave is inﬁnitesimal, in spite
of the diverging wave amplitude (30). In other words, although the energy density
WT ∝ |ΨT |2 of the frozen mode diverges as ω → ωd − 0, it does not grow fast enough
to oﬀset the vanishing group velocity (17). As a consequence, the photonic crystal
becomes totally reﬂective at ω = ωd. Of course, the total reﬂectivity persists at
ω > ωd, where there is no propagating modes at all. By contrast, in the case (29) of a
stationary inﬂection point, the respective Pointing vector ST is ﬁnite and can be even
close to that of the incident wave. The latter implies low reﬂectivity and nearly total
conversion of the incident wave energy into the frozen mode.

The character of frozen mode regime is diﬀerent when we approach the degenerate
band edge frequency from the band gap. In such a case, the transmitted ﬁeld ΨT (z)
is a superposition (21) of two evanescent components. As the frequency ω approaches
ωd, both evanescent contributions grow sharply, while remaining nearly equal and
opposite in sign at the photonic crystal boundary

Ψev1 (0) ≈ −Ψev2 (0) ∝ |ωd − ω|−1/4 , as ω → ωd + 0.

(35)

Again, the destructive interference (35) ensures that the boundary condition (4) is
satisﬁed, while both evanescent contributions to ΨT (z) diverge in accordance with
(35). As the distance z from the slab boundary increases, the destructive interference
of these two evanescent components is lifted and the resulting ﬁeld amplitude increases
sharply, as seen in Fig. 10(a). But eventually, as the distance z further increases,
the transmitted wave ΨT (z) completely decays, because both Bloch contributions to
ΨT (z) are evanescent. The latter constitutes the major diﬀerence between the frozen
mode regime above and below the DBE frequency ωd. The rate of the amplitude
decay, as well as the position of the maximum of the transmitted wave amplitude in
Figs. 4(d – f) and 10(a) , are characterized by the distance Z in (33).

just above the degenerate band edge in Fig. 14(b). Compare these graphs with
those in Fig. 9, where the frequency lies in the transmission band, just below ωd.

semi-inﬁnite periodic layered medium is a superposition of two forward Bloch modes
Ψ1 (z) and Ψ2 (z)

ΨT (z) = Ψ1 (z) + Ψ2 (z) .

(36)

The two Bloch modes in (36) can be a propagating and an evanescent, as in the case
(22), or they can be both evanescent, as in the case (21). The physical reason for
the sharp increase in the transmitted wave amplitude at the frozen mode regime is
that the two Bloch eigenmodes contributing to ΨT (z) become nearly indistinguishable
from each other, as the frequency approaches its critical value

Ψ1 (z) ≈ αΨ2 (z) , as ω → ωs,

(37)

where α is a scalar, and ωs is the frozen mode frequency (ω0 or ωd).

Let us show under what circumstances the property (37) can lead to the frozen
mode regime. The sum (36) of two nearly parallel column vectors Ψ1 and Ψ2 must
If the
match the boundary conditions (4) with the incident and reﬂected waves.
incident wave polarization is general, then the nearly parallel Bloch components Ψ1
and Ψ2 must be very large and nearly equal and opposite

Ψ1 (0) ≈ −Ψ2 (0) ,

|Ψ1 (0)| ≈ |Ψ2 (0)| ≫ |ΨI | ,

(38)

in order to satisfy the boundary conditions (4).
Indeed, since the incident ﬁeld
polarization is general, we have no reason to expect that the column vector Ψ (0)
at the surface is nearly parallel to Ψ1 (0) and Ψ2 (0). But on the other hand, the
boundary conditions say that

Ψ (0) = Ψ1 (0) + Ψ2 (0)

(39)

Obviously, the only situation where the sum (39) of two nearly parallel vectors can be
not nearly parallel to either of them is the one described in (38).

There is one exception, though. As we already stated in (37), in the vicinity of the
frozen mode frequency, the two Bloch components Ψ1 and Ψ2 of the transmitted wave
are nearly parallel to each other. For this reason, if the polarization of the incident

Frozen light in photonic crystals with degenerate band edge

18

wave ΨI is such that Ψ (0) in (39) is nearly parallel to one of the Bloch eigenmodes
Ψ1 (0) or Ψ2 (0), it is also nearly parallel to the other one. So, all three column vectors
Ψ1 (0), Ψ2 (0), and Ψ (0) are now parallel to each other. In this, and only this case, the
amplitude of the transmitted wave ΨT (z) will be comparable to that of the incident
wave. There is no frozen mode regime for the respective vanishingly small range of
the incident wave polarization. A particular case of the above situation is a regime of
a single mode excitation, where only one of the two Bloch components Ψ1 or Ψ2 in
(36) contributes to the transmitted wave.

Finally, let us reiterate that in the limiting cases of ω = ω0 or ω = ωd, the
transmitted wave ΨT (z) corresponds to a non-Bloch Floquet eigenmode (29) or (34),
respectively. Either of them linearly diverges with z. Again, the only exception is when
the incident wave has the unique polarization, at which the transmitted wave ΨT (z)
is a propagating Bloch eigenmode with zero group velocity and a limited amplitude,
comparable to that of the incident wave.

3. Frozen mode regime at oblique propagation – grazing modes

A phenomenon similar to the frozen mode regime can also occur in the case of
oblique wave propagation, where the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves are
all propagate at an angle to the z axis, as shown in Fig. 11. Consider the situation
where the normal component uz of the group velocity of the transmitted propagating
wave vanishes, while the tangential component ~u⊥ remains ﬁnite.

.

This is exactly what happens in the vicinity of the well-known phenomenon of total
internal reﬂection [6]. Similar phenomenon occurs in any photonic crystal at frequency
corresponding to the transmission band edge for a particular direction of incidence.
Remarkably, the total reﬂection of the incident wave is not the only possible outcome.
Another alternative is that the transmitted wave forms an abnormal grazing mode
with dramatically enhanced amplitude and tangential energy ﬂux. The proﬁle of such
a grazing mode, i.e., the ﬁeld dependence on the distance z from the surface, appears
to be very similar to that of the frozen mode at normal incidence shown in Figs. 3
and 4. The only diﬀerence is that the tangential component of the transmitted wave
group velocity now remains ﬁnite and can even be comparable to the speed of light in
vacuum. A signiﬁcant advantage of the oblique version of the frozen mode regime is
that it can occur in much simpler periodic structures, compared to those supporting
the frozen mode regime at normal incidence. Examples of periodic layered arrays
supporting only the oblique version of the frozen mode regime are shown in Figs. 6
and 7. These structures are too simple to support any kind of frozen mode regime
at normal incidence – they have only two diﬀerent layers in a unit cell L, of which
only one layer is anisotropic. But at oblique incidence, these relatively simple periodic
arrays can support the frozen mode regime. The presence of at least one anisotropic
layer in a unit cell L is still required. The physical requirements to periodic structures
capable of supporting both normal and oblique versions of the frozen mode regime are
discussed in Section 5.

3.1. Axial dispersion relation – basic deﬁnitions

Consider a plane monochromatic wave obliquely incident on a periodic semi-inﬁnite
stack, as shown in Fig. 11. Due to the boundary conditions (4), the incident, reﬂected,
and transmitted waves should be assigned the same pair of tangential components
kx, ky of the respective wave vectors

Let us turn to the transmitted wave. The transmitted wave is usually a
composition of two Bloch eigenmodes with the same ~k⊥ = (kx, ky) from (41), but
diﬀerent kz and diﬀerent polarizations. For given ~k⊥ and ω, the value of kz is obtained
by solving the time-harmonic Maxwell equations (52) in the periodic medium. The
so found correspondence between the wavenumber kz and the frequency ω at ﬁxed
~k⊥ is referred to as the axial or normal dispersion relation. Real kz correspond
to propagating (traveling) Bloch modes, while complex kz correspond to evanescent
modes, decaying with the distance z from the surface. Unlike kx and ky, the Bloch
wavenumber kz is deﬁned up to a multiple of 2π/L.

Similarly to the case of normal propagation, the expression (40) deﬁnes stationary
points of the axial dispersion relation. The deﬁnition (40) is a generalization of (8) to
the case of oblique propagation. Diﬀerent kinds of axial stationary points are deﬁned
as follows.

The above deﬁnitions are analogous to those in (11), (1), and (2), related to
the case of normal propagation. We still can refer to the band diagrams in Fig. 2,
where the quantity k is now understood as the normal component kz of the Bloch
wavenumber at ﬁxed ~k⊥.

3.2. Grazing mode solutions

All basic features of axially frozen mode regime at oblique incidence are virtually the
In particular, all the expressions (20)
same as in the case of normal propagation.

though (39) of the previous section describing the structure and composition of the
transmitted ﬁeld ΨT (z) remain unchanged. This close similarity holds both for the
frozen mode regime at a stationary inﬂection point (44) and at a degenerate band edge
(45). In either case, Figs. 3 and 4 give an adequate idea of the frozen mode proﬁle.
Still, there is one essential qualitative diﬀerence. Namely, in the case of axially frozen
mode we have to remember that the tangential component of the group velocity is not
zero, even if the normal component (40) vanishes. This means that the axially frozen
mode is in fact an abnormal grazing mode with purely tangential energy ﬂux, greatly
enhanced amplitude, and a very unusual proﬁle, similar to that shown in Figs. 3 and
4. The tangential energy ﬂux of the transmitted wave is

S⊥ = WT (z) u⊥,

(46)

where the tangential component u⊥ of the group velocity remains large in the vicinity
of axially frozen mode regime. Therefore, the tangential energy ﬂux S⊥ also grows
dramatically, as the frequency approaches the respective critical point (44) or (45).
This situation is illustrated in Fig. 12.

Note that the purely tangential energy ﬂux in the transmitted wave in Fig. 12 does
not mean that this grazing mode can be classiﬁed as a surface wave. Indeed, a surface
wave is supposed to decay with the distance from the interface in either direction,
which is not the case here. The possibility of abnormal surface waves associated
with a degenerate band edge of axial dispersion relation will be addressed in the next
subsection.

3.3. Subsurface waves in the vicinity of degenerate band edge of axial dispersion
relation

So far in this section we have tacitly assumed that

x + k2
k2

y < ω2c2.

(47)

(48)

The inequality (47) implies that the z component (42) of the wave vector of the
incident wave is real. This is a natural assumption when considering the problem of
a plane wave incident on a semi-inﬁnite photonic crystal.

Consider now the opposite case where

x + k2
k2

y > ω2c2.

In this situation, there is no plane propagating waves in vacuum matching the
boundary conditions (41). Still, if the frequency ω lies inside a band gap for a given
~k⊥, there can be a solution for ΨT corresponding to a surface wave (see, for example,
[16] and references therein). Generally, such a solution is a superposition (21) of two
evanescent modes.

Consider now a surface wave in the vicinity of a degenerate band edge (45) of
the axial dispersion relation. The Bloch composition of the ﬁeld inside the periodic
medium is

ΨT (z) = Ψev1 (z) + Ψev2 (z) , where ω ' ωd, z ≥ 0.

(49)

As frequency ω approaches ωd, the column vectors Ψev1 and Ψev2 in (49) become
nearly parallel to each other (see (37) and comments therein). Together, they can
form a surface wave with the proﬁle similar to that of the frozen mode shown in Fig.

Frozen light in photonic crystals with degenerate band edge

22

10(a). Although formally, it would still be a surface wave, its proﬁle is highly unusual.
Namely, the ﬁeld amplitude inside the periodic medium sharply increases with the
distance z from the surface, reaches its maximum at a certain distance Z deﬁned in
(33), and only after that it begins a slow decay. Since the ﬁeld amplitude reaches its
maximum only at a distance from the surface, and the respective maximum value can
exceed the ﬁeld amplitude at the interface by several orders of magnitude, such a wave
can be referred to as a subsurface wave.

4. Floquet modes at stationary points of dispersion relation

Whether or not a given photonic crystal can support the frozen mode regime is
if the
determined by its (axial) electromagnetic dispersion relation. Speciﬁcally,
dispersion relation develops a stationary inﬂection point or a degenerate band edge,
then one can always expect the frozen mode regime in the vicinity of the respective
frequency. Restricting ourselves to periodic layered structures, we can link the
symmetry of the periodic array to the possibility of the existence of the proper
stationary point of the dispersion relation.

The ﬁrst subsection of this section starts with some basic deﬁnitions and
notations of electrodynamics of stratiﬁed media involving birefringent layers. We
brieﬂy describe the formalism of 4 × 4 transfer matrix generalized to the case of
oblique wave propagation. Diﬀerent modiﬁcations of this approach have been used
in electrodynamics of stratiﬁed media for at least two decades (see, for example, [15]
and references therein). Wherever possible, we use exactly the same notations and
terminology as in [9, 10].

In the second subsection we establish the relation between the symmetry of the
periodic layered array and the possibility of the existence of a degenerate band edge in
the respective dispersion relation. The emphasis is on the case of oblique propagation,
where the symmetry restrictions on the periodic array are much less severe. As a
consequence, the axial frozen mode regime at oblique incidence can occur in periodic
structures that are too simple to support the frozen mode regime at normal incidence.
Examples of the periodic layered structures supporting the (axial) dispersion relation
with a degenerate band edge are considered in the next section.

4.1. Time-harmonic Maxwell equations in periodic layered media

Our analysis is based on time-harmonic Maxwell equations

with linear constitutive relations

~D (x, y, z) = ˆε (z) ~E (x, y, z) , ~B (x, y, z) = ˆµ (z) ~H (x, y, z) .

(51)

In layered media, the material tensors ˆε and ˆµ in (51) depend on a single Cartesian
coordinate z. Using (51), the Eqs. (50) can be recast as follows

∇ × ~E (x, y, z) = i

ˆµ (z) ~H (x, y, z) , ∇ × ~H (x, y, z) = −i

Let us turn to the scattering problem of Fig. 11. Given the boundary conditions
(41), the ﬁeld dependence on the transverse coordinates x and y can be accounted for
by the following substitution in (52)

~E (~r) = ei(kxx+kyy) ~E (z) , ~H (~r) = ei(kxx+kyy) ~H (z) ,

which also allows to separate the tangential ﬁeld components into a closed system of
four linear diﬀerential equations

In the particular case of ~k k z, (55) turns into (3). The system (54) is referred to
as the reduced time-harmonic Maxwell equations. The 4 × 4 matrix M (z) in (54)
is referred to as the (reduced) Maxwell operator. Note that due to the substitution
(53), the Maxwell operator M (z) depends not only on the physical parameters of
the periodic structure, but also on the tangential components ~k⊥ = (kx, ky) of the
wave vector. The explicit expression for M (z) for the case of oblique propagation in
stratiﬁed media composed of birefringent layers is rather cumbersome. It can be found
, for example, in [10], along with extensive discussion of its analytical properties.

for the reduced Maxwell equation (54) has a unique solution

The 4 × 4 matrix T (z, z0) is referred to as the transfer matrix. It relates the values of
time-harmonic electromagnetic ﬁeld Ψ (z) at any two points z1 and z2 of the stratiﬁed
medium. The transfer matrix of a stack of layers is deﬁned as

where z = 0 and z = D are the stack boundaries. The transfer matrix of an arbitrary
stack is a sequential product of the transfer matrices Tm of the constitutive layers

If the individual layers m are uniform, the corresponding single-layer transfer matrices
Tm can be explicitly expressed in terms of the respective Maxwell operators Mm

where Dm is the thickness of the m-th layer. The explicit expression for the Maxwell
operator Mm of an arbitrary uniform anisotropic layer can be found, for example, in
[10]. Therefore, Eq. (58) together with (59) provide an explicit analytical expression
for the transfer matrix TS of an arbitrary stack of uniform dielectric layers with or
without anisotropy, for an arbitrary (oblique or normal) direction of propagation.

4.2.1. Transfer matrix in periodic layered media In a periodic layered medium, the
4 × 4 matrix M (z) in (54) is a periodic functions of z

M (z + L) = M (z) .

Bloch solutions Ψk (z) of the reduced Maxwell equation (54) with the periodic M (z)
are deﬁned as

Ψk (z + L) = eikLΨk (z) .

In the case of oblique propagation, the quantity k in (60) denotes the z component of
the Bloch wave vector.

Introducing the transfer matrix of a unit cell L

we have from (57), (60) and (61)

Thus, the four eigenvectors

TL = T (L, 0) ,

TLΨk (0) = eikLΨk (0) .

Ψi (0) , i = 1, 2, 3, 4.

Xi = eikiL, i = 1, 2, 3, 4

det (TL − XI) .

of the transfer matrix TL of a unit cell are uniquely related to the Bloch solutions
Ψk (z) of the reduced Maxwell equation (54). The respective four eigenvalues

of TL are the roots of the characteristic polynomial

Each of the four eigenvectors (63) corresponds to either propagating or evanescent
Bloch wave, depending on whether or not the respective Bloch wavenumber ki from
(64) is real. Further in this section we will see that the relation (63) does not apply at
stationary inﬂection points of the (axial) dispersion relation. This important exception
is directly related to the very nature of the frozen mode regime.

The explicit expressions for the 4 × 4 transfer matrix (61), along with the detailed

description of its analytical properties can be found, for example, in [10, 13].

4.2.2. Transfer matrix at stationary points of dispersion relation Although at any
given frequency ω, the reduced Maxwell equation (54) has exactly four linearly
independent solutions, it does not imply that all four of them are Bloch waves as
deﬁned in (60). Speciﬁcally, at frequencies of stationary points (43), (44), or (45)
where the axial component of the group velocity of some of the propagating modes
vanishes, some of the solutions can be algebraically diverging with z. For example, at
frequency ωd of a degenerate photonic band edge, the four solutions of Eq. (54) include

(60)

(61)

(62)

(63)

(64)

(65)

Frozen light in photonic crystals with degenerate band edge

25

a propagating Bloch mode with zero group velocity and three Floquet eigenmodes
diverging as z, z2, and z3, respectively (see the details in [14, 13]). Some of these
eigenmodes are essential for understanding the frozen mode regime.

Consider such non-Bloch solutions in terms of the transfer matrix TL of a unit
cell. Although the matrix (61) is invertible, it is neither Hermitian, nor unitary and,
therefore, may not be diagonalizable. Speciﬁcally, if the frequency approaches one
of the stationary points (43), (44), or (45), some of the four eigenvectors Ψk (0) in
(62) become nearly parallel to each other. Eventually, as ω reaches the the stationary
point value, the number of linearly independent eigenvectors Ψk (0) becomes lesser
than four, and the relation (63) does not apply at this particular point. The number
of linearly independent eigenvectors of the transfer matrix is directly linked to its
canonical Jordan form.

At a general frequency diﬀerent from that of any stationary point of the (axial)
dispersion relation, the transfer matrix TL is diagonalizable, and its canonical Jordan
form is trivial

associated with one propagating Bloch mode with zero group velocity, and three non-
Bloch eigenmodes diverging as z, z2, and z3, respectively . If the frequency ω deviates
from that of the stationary point, the transfer matrix TL becomes diagonalizable
with the canonical Jordan form (66). The perturbation theory relating the non-Bloch
eigenmodes at the frequency of degenerate band edge to the Bloch eigenmodes in the
vicinity of this point is presented in [13].

The other possibilities include a regular band edge (43) and a stationary inﬂection

point (44). Those cases are discussed in [10, 14, 13].

5. Periodic layered structures with degenerate band edge of axial
dispersion relation

Not any periodic stack can have electromagnetic dispersion relation with a degenerate
band edge (45). One fundamental restrictions stems from the fact that at the frequency

Frozen light in photonic crystals with degenerate band edge

26

ωd of degenerate band edge, the transfer matrix TL must have the canonical form (67).
Such a matrix cannot be reduced to a block-diagonal form, let alone diagonalized.
Therefore, a necessary condition for the existence of a degenerate band edge is that
the symmetry of the transfer matrix TL does not impose its reducibility to a block-
diagonal form. The above condition does not imply that the transfer matrix TL must
not be reducible to a block-diagonal form at any frequency ω. Indeed, at a general
frequency ω, the matrix TL is always reducible and even diagonalizable. The strength
of the symmetry imposed reducibility, though, is that it leaves no room for exceptions,
such as the frequency ωd of degenerate band edge, where the transfer matrix TL must
not be reducible to a block-diagonal form. Therefore, in the case of symmetry imposed
reducibility of the transfer matrix, the very existence of degenerate band edge (45) is
ruled out.

At this point we would like to emphasize the important diﬀerence between the
cases of normal and oblique propagation.
In the case of normal propagation, the
symmetry of the Maxwell operator M (z) in (54) and the transfer matrix TL simply
reﬂects the symmetry of the periodic layered array. By contrast, in the case of oblique
propagation, the substitution (53) lowers the symmetry of the matrices M (z) and
TL and makes it dependent not only on the periodic structure itself, but also on the
orientation of ~k⊥ = (kx, ky) in the x − y plane. Lower symmetry of the ”oblique”
transfer matrix TL may remove its symmetry-imposed reducibility to a block-diagonal
form, even if at normal incident such a reducibility was imposed by the symmetry
group of the periodic structure.
In other words, even if a certain periodic layered
structure cannot support a degenerate band edge at normal propagation, it may
develop such a stationary point at oblique propagation. In this respect, the situation
with degenerate band edge is reminiscent of that of a stationary inﬂection point, where
the cases of normal and oblique propagation are also essentially diﬀerent from each
other [9, 10]. Observe, though, that in periodic layered structures, the possibilities of
a stationary inﬂection point and a degenerate band edge are mutually exclusive.

Further in this section we consider speciﬁc examples of periodic layered arrays
supporting a degenerate band edge and the related frozen mode regime. We start with
the particular case of normal propagation, requiring more complex periodic structures.

5.1. Degenerate band edge at normal propagation

The simplest periodic layered structure capable of supporting a degenerate band edge
at normal propagation is shown in Fig. 5. A unit cell L contains one isotropic B
layer and two misaligned anisotropic layers A1 and A2 with inplane anisotropy. The
isotropic layers have the thickness B and the dielectric permittivity

where the parameter δ characterizes the magnitude of inplane anisotropy and the
angle ϕ determines the orientation of the anisotropy axes in the x − y plane. All the

(68)

(69)

Frozen light in photonic crystals with degenerate band edge

27

A layers have the same thickness A and the same magnitude δ of inplane anisotropy.
The only diﬀerence between the adjacent anisotropic layers A1 and A2 in Fig. 5 is
their orientation ϕ. An important characteristic of the periodic structure in Fig. 5 is
the misalignment angle

φ = ϕ1 − ϕ2
between the layers A1 and A2. This angle determines the symmetry of the periodic
array and, eventually, the kind of k − ω diagram it can display. Fig. 13 illustrates the
relation between the misalignment angle φ and the symmetry of the respective k − ω
diagram.

(70)

Generally, there are three possibilities, reﬂected in Table. 1.

In the case φ = 0, all anisotropic layers have aligned in-plane anisotropy. The
term ”aligned” means that one can choose the directions of the in-plane Cartesian axes
x and y so that the permittivity tensors in all layers are diagonalized simultaneously.
In this setting, the Maxwell equations for the electromagnetic waves with x- and the y -
polarizations propagating along the z axis are uncoupled, implying that the respective
transfer matrix can be reduced to the block-diagonal form

The two blocks in (71) correspond to the x and y polarization of light. The forth
degree characteristic polynomial (65) of the block-diagonal matrix (71) factorizes into
the product

F4(X) = Fx(X)Fy(X),
where Fx(X) and Fy(X) are independent second degree polynomials related to
electromagnetic waves with the x- and the y - polarizations, respectively, propagating
along the z direction. The k − ω diagram for this case is shown in Fig. 13(a), where
each spectral curve relates to a speciﬁc linear polarization of light. In this case, the
symmetry imposed reducibility of the matrix TL to a block-diagonal form (71) rules
out the existence of a degenerate band edge.

(72)

In the case φ = π/2, the anisotropy axes in the adjacent layers A1 and A2 are
perpendicular to each other. The point symmetry group of the periodic array is now
D2d , which is a tetragonal symmetry class. The tetragonal symmetry results in
polarization degeneracy, implying that the respective transfer matrix can be reduced
to the following block-diagonal form

Frozen light in photonic crystals with degenerate band edge

The two identical blocks in (73) correspond to either polarization of light. The forth
degree characteristic polynomial (65) of the block-diagonal matrix (73) factorizes into
the product

F4(X) = F2(X)F2(X),

where F2(X) is a second degree polynomial related to electromagnetic waves with
either polarization propagating along the z direction. The k − ω diagram for this case
is shown in Fig. 13(b), where each spectral branch is doubly degenerate with respect
to polarization. In this case, the symmetry imposed reducibility of the matrix TL to
a block-diagonal form (73) also rules out the existence of a degenerate band edge.

Finally, in the case φ 6= 0, π/2, the periodic stack in Fig. 5 has a chiral point
symmetry described as D2. There is no symmetry prohibition on a degenerate band
edge in this case, because the Bloch modes with diﬀerent polarizations now have
the same symmetry and, therefore, are coupled.
In this case, one can adjust the
misalignment angle φ and/or the relative layer thickness

b = B/L = B/(2A + B),

(75)

so that a given spectral branch develops a degenerate band edge. The respective value
of the wavenumber is either k = 0, or k = π/L.

In the numerical example in Fig. 14 we show four k − ω diagrams of the periodic
structure in Fig. 5 corresponding to four diﬀerent values of the ratio b in (75). In all
cases, the misalignment angle φ is equal to π/4. The k − ω diagrams in Figs. 14(a)
and 14(b) show a degenerate band edge in the respective spectral branches. Note that
the k − ω diagrams in Figs. 13(c) and 14(b) are identical.

If the isotropic B layers are completely removed from the periodic structure
in Fig. 5, the point symmetry group of the periodic array rises from D2 to D2h,
acquiring the glide mirror plane mk. The two diﬀerent linear polarizations now become
uncoupled regardless of the misalignment angle φ, while the transfer matrix TL of the
stack develops a symmetry imposed reducibility to a block-diagonal form (71). The
respective k − ω diagram is shown in Fig. 14(d).

5.2. Degenerate band edge at oblique propagation

Consider now a periodic structure with just two layers A and B in a unit cell, as shown
in Fig. 7. The dielectric material of the A layer has an inplane anisotropy (69) while
the B layer is isotropic. For speciﬁcity, we can set

ˆεA = 

Note that the structure in Fig. 5 reduces to that in Fig. 7 in the particular case of
φ = 0. Indeed, if the misalignment angle between A1 and A2 in Fig. 5 is zero, these
two anisotropic layers together make a single A layer with double thickness. Therefore,
at normal propagation, the k − ω diagram of the periodic array in Fig. 7 is similar to
that shown in Fig. 13(a) and related to the periodic structure in Fig. 5 with φ = 0.
There is no possibility of a degenerate band edge in this case.





The situation remains unchanged if the direction of propagation deviates from
the z axis, but is conﬁned either in the x − z, or in the y − z plane. In either case, the
respective plane is the mirror plane of the transfer matrix, ensuring that the x and

Frozen light in photonic crystals with degenerate band edge

29

y polarizations remain uncoupled. Uncoupled polarizations imply that the transfer
matrix TL is reducible to the block-diagonal form (71) at all frequencies. Again, there
is no possibility of a degenerate band edge in this case either.

The situation changes only in the case of oblique propagation with kx, ky 6= 0.
The Maxwell equations (54) for diﬀerent light polarizations are not decoupled any
more, and the respective transfer matrix cannot be automatically reduced to a block-
diagonal form at all frequencies. As a consequence, at certain direction of propagation,
some spectral branches can develop a degenerate band edge, as shown in the example
in Fig. 15. In fact, for a given frequency ωd from a certain frequency range, one can
ﬁnd a speciﬁc direction ~k⊥ = (kx, ky) for which the degenerate band edge (45) occurs
at the chosen frequency ωd. In the example in Fig. 15, we simply set kx = ky and
A = B. In such a case, the degenerate band edge frequency and the respective value
of kx = ky are predetermined by the physical parameters of the periodic array.

5.3. Values of physical parameters used in numerical simulations

In all numerical simulations related to nonmagnetic layered structures in Figs. 5 and
7 we use the following values of material parameters in (68), (69) and (76)

εA = 11.05, δ = 7.44, ε3 = 18.49, εB = 1.

(77)

The relative thickness of the A and B layers in Fig. 5, as well as the value of the
misalignment angle (70) can be diﬀerent in diﬀerent cases.

In a single case related to a nonreciprocal periodic layered structure with a
stationary inﬂection point described in Figs. 3 and 8 we use the following numerical
values of the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability tensors of the anisotropic
A layers and magnetic B layers

z > 0 we, in fact, plotted the following physical quantity

which is the squared ﬁeld amplitude averaged over a local unit cell. The actual function
|Ψ (z)|2, as well as the electromagnetic energy density distribution W (z), are strongly
oscillating functions of the coordinate z, with the period of oscillations coinciding
with the unit cell length L. Given the relation W ∝ |Ψ (z)|2, the quantity (80) can
also be qualitatively interpreted as the smoothed energy density distribution, with the
correction coeﬃcient of the order of unity.

In all plots, the distance z, the wave number k, and the frequency ω are expressed

in units of L, L−1, and cL−1, respectively.

6. Conclusion

In this paper we outlined several diﬀerent manifestations of the frozen mode regime
in photonic crystals. Although all our numerical examples relate to periodic layered
structures, in fact, the frozen mode regime is a universal wave phenomenon. Indeed,
we can talk about diﬀerent kinds of wave excitations in low-loss periodic media. But as
soon as the respective Bloch dispersion relation displays a singularity like a stationary
inﬂection point (44) or a degenerate band edge (45), we have every reason to expect a
very similar behavior involving the frozen mode regime. In other words, the possibility
of the frozen mode regime is determined by some fundamental spectral properties of
the periodic structure. If a periodic array is relatively simple – for instance, a stratiﬁed
medium with one dimensional periodicity – its frequency spectrum may prove to be
too simple to support the proper spectral singularity. The more complex the periodic
structure is, the more likely it will be capable of supporting such a phenomenon.
For instance, in the case of layered arrays we need birefringent layers and, at normal
propagation, at least three layers in a unit cell.

Another important question is how robust the frozen mode regime is. For
instance, what happens if we introduce a small absorption or structural imperfections.
Of course, these factors suppress the frozen mode amplitude. But in this respect,
the frozen mode regime is no diﬀerent from any other coherent or resonance eﬀects it
periodic structures. This problem can be addressed at any particular frequency range
by appropriate choice of the constitutive materials.

Another fundamental restriction relates to the size of the periodic structure. In
this paper we assumed that the periodic array occupies the entire half-space z ≥ 0.

the intersecting dispersion curves correspond to the Bloch waves with diﬀerent

A good insight on what happens to the frozen mode in a ﬁnite periodic array is
given by Fig. 16. These graphs demonstrate that the frozen mode regime in a ﬁnite
periodic array can be as robust as that in an hypothetical semi-inﬁnite structure. The
optimal number of layers depends on such factors as the absorption characteristics
of the constitutive materials, the geometrical imperfections of the periodic array, the
desired degree of ﬁeld enhancement in the frozen mode, etc. On the other hand, in
ﬁnite (bounded) photonic crystals, some new resonance phenomena can arise, such as
transmission band edge resonances [2, 3, 14]. These eﬀects, though, occur at slightly
diﬀerent frequencies and are qualitatively diﬀerent from the frozen mode regime. The
transmission band edge resonance in the vicinity of a degenerate band edge was studied

Figure 16. Smoothed proﬁle of the frozen mode in periodic layered structures
composed of diﬀerent number N of unit cells L in Fig. 5. The frequency is equal
to that of degenerate band edge. The initial rate of growth of the frozen mode
amplitude is virtually independent of N and described by (34). The limiting case
(d) of the semi-inﬁnite structure is also shown in Fig. 4(c).
In all cases, the
incident wave has the same polarization and unity amplitude.

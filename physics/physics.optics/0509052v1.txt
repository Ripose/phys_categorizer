Low crosstalk intersections formed by two crossing coupled cavity waveguides (CCWs), which
are formed by series of mono-mode cavities in a two dimensional photonic crystal structure, are
investigated. Although the individual cavities are mono-mode, the modes of the properly designed
CCWs (which are called supermodes in this paper) may be dipole-like, and antisymmetry along
the axis of the other perpendicular CCW, which ensures the low crosstalk of the intersections.
According to the results of coupled mode analysis, we divide the intersections into two kinds based
on the number of cavities of each CCW, and the transmission and crosstalk spectra of both kinds
are numerically obtained using ﬁnite diﬀerence time domain (FDTD) method. The results show
that crosstalk power is lower than −30dB. We also discuss the factors that aﬀect the performance
of the intersections.

INTRODUCTION

Low crosstalk intersections of optical waveguides are
key components in compact and high dense optical inte-
grated circuits. Usually, the intersection of two crossing
waveguides should be designed and optimized properly,
or large crosstalk and reﬂection may be appear. For the
intersections formed by two conventional planar waveg-
uides, mode expander structures may be used to decrease
crosstalk and reﬂection (intersection #0).1 For the inter-
sections of line defect waveguides in photonic crystals
(PCs),2,3 several designs have been proposed:4,5,6,7 Pre-
viously, the two crossing PC line defect waveguides are
coupled to a common resonator (a point defect) (inter-
section #1), and the proper symmetry of the resonator’s
mode ensures the low crosstalk between the two crossing
waveguides.4 Subsequently, this idea is used to design the
crossing of two modiﬁed planar waveguides (with cavi-
ties or cuts in them).4,9 However, due to the single mode
property of the resonator, only one operation frequency
(the frequency can be tuned by the resonator) is demon-
strated to be low crosstalk in Ref.4. Recently, S. Lan
and H. Ishikawa proposed a broad bandwidth operation
of line defect PC waveguide intersections by replacing the
single resonator of intersection #1 with a coupled cavity
structure (intersection #2).5 Due to the wide broadband
transmission band of the CCW,10,11 broad bandwidth
operation of low crosstalk intersection is numerically ver-
iﬁed in a triangle lattice PC structure,5 which is also
valid for ultrashort (about 500-fs) pulse transmission for
the broadband property. More recently, a new design
and optimization of line defect PC waveguide crossing
based on Wannier basis is investigated in a square lattice
(intersection #3).6,7,8 The bandwidth of the optimized
crossing is very high (δλ/λ ∼ 2%), and crosstalk is very
low (−40dB).7

Apart from the line defect waveguide, another impor-
tant kind of waveguide in PC is the coupled cavity waveg-
uide (CCW).10,11 Although many novel optical functional
elements based on CCW structure have been proposed,
such as the optical power splitter,12,13 band drop ﬁlter,14

fact, the intersection #2 of hybrid waveguides structure
in Ref. 5 is a design for two crossing CCWs.

Generally speaking, all the intersections mentioned
above are all based on the orthogonality of the ﬁeld pat-
tern of one waveguide in the intersection area with re-
spect to the other crossing waveguide. Therefore, the
cavities of intersection #1 should be multi-pole mode,
and a mono-pole mode is not suitable for low crosstalk
intersection.4,5 When a CCW is used, the intersection us-
ing the mono-pole mode of the cavity is also impossible.5
In this paper, we report a new mechanism of low
crosstalk intersection of two CCWs, which are formed by
sequences of mono-mode cavities in a square lattice PC
structure. Although the individual cavities are mono-
mode, the supermodes (result from the strong coupling
between cavities) of the CCW may be dipole-like, which
ensures the low crosstalk between the two intersecting
CCWs, and the working frequencies can be tuned easily.

II. MODE PATTERNS OF THE SUPERMODES

It’s reported that the eigenfrequency spectra of CCW
structures follow into two diﬀerent shapes:22,23 One is
a continuous band and the other is a series of N (the
number of cavities) discrete modes.21 And the shapes of
the spectrum depend on the coupling strength between
cavities.22,23

For the continuous spectrum modes, the coupling be-
tween neighboring cavities is weak, and the tight binding
theory gives a complete description.10,11 While for the
discrete modes, the coupling between neighboring cav-
ities is strong, and we surprisingly ﬁnd that a coupled
mode theory may be used to predict the eigenfrequen-
cies, mode proﬁles and as well as the quality factors of
each supermodes.21,24

In the coupled mode theory, the electric ﬁeld of the
overall CCW is expressed by the superposition of the in-

Where N is the total number of cavities, and Ω and ω

are the distance between two neighboring cavities and
the unit vector of the alignment direction of the cavities,
respectively. Substituting Eq.

using R drE(r − mRez)·, one can obtain a group of cou-
pled linear equations about the coeﬃcients of An. Solv-
ing the equation group, one obtain N allowed supermodes
for the CCW system. For the Lth (L = 1, 2 · · · , N ) mode,

the coupled mode theory, the readers are referred to Ref.
21.

m+1 = AL

One of the most important results of the theory is the
determination of the superposition coeﬃcients of Eq.(2),
which measure the contribution of each cavity to the Lth
supermode. For the case of N being an odd integer, i.e.,
N = 2m + 1 with m an integer, one can ﬁnd that the
amplitude of the central ((m + 1)th, n = m + 1) cavity of
the Lth supermodes are AL
0 sin(Lπ/2). There-
fore, for the case of L = 2, 4, · · · , 2m, AL
m+1 = 0. More
importantly, the amplitudes of the lth (l = 1, 2, · · · , m)
cavity modes to both sides of the (m + 1)th cavity are
m+1+l = −AL
antisymmetry, i.e, AL
m+1−l. For the other
cases of L = 1, 3, · · · , 2m + 1, |AL
m+1| = 1. Fig. 1(a)
shows the values of AL
n for the case of N = 7. Clearly,
for the 4th cavity, the coeﬃcients of AL
4 are all zero for
L = 2, 4, 6, and more importantly, the overall distribu-
tion of the coeﬃcients are antisymmetry about the center
of the CCW (shown by the dashed line in Fig. 1).

For the case of N being an even integer, i.e., N = 2m
with m an integer, the coeﬃcients of the central cavities
(the mth and (m + 1)th cavities) are not zero. However,
the coeﬃcients are also antisymmetry about the center
of the structure for the cases of L = 2, 4, · · · , 2m, and
symmetry for the cases of L = 1, 3, · · · , 2m − 1. Fig. 1(b)
shows the coeﬃcients for the case of N = 6, and the
symmetrical axis is shown by the dashed line.

From the analysis and theoretical results presented
above, one can ﬁnd that although the ﬁeld pattern of
an individual cavity is mono-pole symmetry, half of the
supermodes of the CCW may be dipole-like, of which
the mode patterns are antisymmetry about the center of
CCW. If another CCW is set perpendicular to the CCW,

and the intersection area is set at the center of the CCW,
it is possible to achieve low crosstalk intersection for the
for the m supermodes of L = 2, 4, · · · , 2m.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

As an example of illustration, we design intersections of
two CCWs in a frequently used square lattice PC struc-
ture, which is formed by dielectric cylinders in vacuum
(nb = 1), as shown in Fig.2. The refractive indexes of
cylinders are na = 3.4, and the radii of the cylinders
are 0.2a, with a the lattice constant. This PC structure
opens a large band gap of (0.29 ∼ 0.42)(2πc/a) for the
TM polarization (electric ﬁeld vector parallel to the axes
of the cylinders). An individual cavity is fabricated by
removing a cylinder completely. According to the above
results of coupled mode theory, we divide the intersec-
tions into two types, as shown in Fig. 2, i.e,.
type-A
(Fig.2(a)) and type-B (Fig.2(b)).

For the type-A intersection, the numbers of cavities
along both x (Nx) and y (Ny) directions are odd. With-
out loss of generality, we set Nx = 7 and Ny = 5, re-

transmission and crosstalk are numerically derived. For
the FDTD simulation, 20 spatial grids are divided in a
lattice constant a, and perfect matched layers (PML) ab-
sorbing boundary conditions (ABC) are set around the
structures.

Fig. 3 shows the normalized transmission (solid lines)
and crosstalk (dashed lines) power of the type-A inter-
section (shown in Fig.2(a)) when incident along x di-
rection (Fig.3(a)), and y direction (Fig.3(b)), respec-
tively. Clearly, for the x direction incident, the three
frequencies of ω1 = 0.3664(2πc/a), ω2 = 0.3777(2πc/a)
and ω3 = 0.3906(2πc/a) transmit through the inter-
section with corresponding crosstalk of about −35dB,
−30dB and −22dB, respectively. When the signal in-
cident along y direction, there are two frequencies of
ω
2 = 0.3697(2πc/a) transmit
with a crosstalk ratios of both about −30dB.

direction and the 3th along y direction) are overlapped.
The single cavity supports a monopole resonate state at
the frequency of ω = 0.3784(2πc/a), as shown in the in-
set of Fig. 2(a). For the type-B intersection, the Nx and
Ny are both even integers, as shown in Fig. 2(b).

According to the analysis in Ref.4 and 5, the cavities,
which support mono-modes only, are not suitable for low
crosstalk operation. However, for the supermodes of the
CCWs, low crosstalk is achieved successfully in the two
structures of Fig. 2. Using the ﬁnite diﬀerence time

shown in Fig.
ω1 = 0.3698(2πc/a), ω2 = 0.3812(2πc/a) and ω2 =
0.3974(2πc/a), the crosstalk ratios are about −40dB,
−48dB and −30dB, respectively. Fig. 6 (a), (b) and (c)
show the electric ﬁeld intensity distribution of the three
frequencies of ω1, ω2 and ω3 respectively.

From the results of coupled mode analysis, we have
predicted that for the cavity number of 2m and 2m + 1,
there are m frequencies of which the mode patterns sat-
isfy the conditions of low crosstalk. The numerical results
of Fig. 3, 4, 5 and 6 conﬁrm our prediction. For the case
of Nx = 6, 7 and Ny = 5, the number of low crosstalk fre-
quencies are 3 and 2. From the electric ﬁeld distribution
of Fig. 4 and Fig. 6, the low crosstalk mechanisms can
be understood more clearly. One can see that near the
intersection, there is a π phase diﬀerence for the cavity
modes to both sides of the crossing CCW, such as the
3rd and 5th cavities in Fig. 4 (a-c), and the 3rd and 4th
cavities in Fig. 6. Therefore, the tunneling signals of
them interfere destructively in the perpendicular CCWs,
and this is the physical mechanism of low crosstalk.

According to the above discussion and numerical re-
sults, one can ﬁnd that the number of cavity N (Nx and
Ny) aﬀects the performance of the intersection greatly.
Only the type-A and type-B structures can eliminate the
crosstalk eﬃciently, i.e., the Nx and Ny must be both odd
integers or both be even integers. If one of Nx and Ny is
odd and the other is even, then low crosstalk is impossi-
ble for the mode symmetry of the supermodes. Another
condition for the low crosstalk intersection is that the two
CCWs must be overlap at the center and perpendicular
to each other.

Although only a small number of Nx and Ny is dis-
cussed, one can straightly extend to the case of large
values of N (Nx and Ny). However, there is a max-
imum value for N . Suppose the average linewidth of
each mode is δωL and the bandwidth of the CCW is

about ∆ω. The upper limit of N is Nmax ∼ ∆ω/δω,
and the maximum number of low crosstalk frequencies is
[Nmax/2] ([·] means the integer part of a number). The
bandwidth of the CCW can be tuned by changing the
coupling of neighboring cavities.10,11 And the linewidth
of each mode can be tuned by the conﬁnement of the
cavities.21 For the case of supermodes of CCW, the cou-
ple between cavities is much stronger than the case of
continuous modes, therefore the bandwidth of ∆ω is very
large. For the structures demonstrated in this paper, the
bandwidth (bandwidth to center frequency ratio δω/ω)
is about 10%, which is much larger than the bandwidth
demonstrated before.4,5,6,7

In this paper, the reﬂection spectrum is not considered.
Although the maximum normalized transmission power
is only 85% (ω2 in Fig. 5), we belive that the reﬂection
mainly originates from the coupling of the CCW and the
incident source, but not from the existence of the inter-
section. The reﬂectance can be optimized using some
tapered structure,26,27 or using some novel optimization
algorithm.7,8

Finally, we want to point out that for the other
eigenfrequencies (corresponding to the cases of L =
1, 3, · · · 2m−1 for the case of N = 2m or L = 1, 3, · · · 2m+

1 for the case of N = 2m+1), due to the symmetry of the
mode proﬁles, the coupling of the two CCWs is strong.
And this results in the supermodes split into more than
one supermodes, and the crosstalk of them are all very
high.
In fact, the crosstalk are at the same level as
the transmission power. Therefore, for these modes, the
intersection structure performs just like a 1-to-3 power
splitter, rather than a low crosstalk intersection.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have investigated low crosstalk inter-
sections of two CCWs that are composed by mono-mode

5

cavities in a square lattice PC structures. The desired
mode symmetry (orthogonal to the perpendicular CCW)
is achieved by the combination of all the cavities but not
a single cavity near the intersection. Our results show
that for a cavity number of N , there are [N/2] (the in-
teger part of N/2) frequencies are low crosstalk. We an-
alyzed the mode proﬁles using a coupled mode theory,
and obtained the transmission and crosstalk spectra us-
ing FDTD method. We also obtained the electric ﬁeld
distributions at stable states of the low crosstalk modes,
from which we analyzed the physical mechanism of low
crosstalk.

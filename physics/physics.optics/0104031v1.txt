Diﬀraction-free and dispersion-free pulsed beam propagation in dispersive media

Pulsed Bessel beams of light propagating in free-space experience diﬀraction eﬀects that resem-
ble those of anomalous dispersion on pulse propagation. It is then shown that a pulsed Bessel
beam in a normally dispersive material can remain diﬀraction- and dispersion-free due to mu-
tual cancellation of diﬀraction and group velocity dispersion. The size of the Bessel transversal
proﬁle for localized transmission is determined by the dispersive properties of the material at
the pulse carrier frequency.

Two of the biggest obstacles to the transmission of lo-
calized electromagnetic energy over large distances are
diﬀraction and material dispersion. Generally speaking,
diﬀraction makes waves to spread transversally to the
intended propagation direction, and dispersion tempo-
rally (longitudinally). Many methods have been pro-
posed and experientally demonstrated, to diminish, even
eliminate either diﬀraction spreading in free-space, by
using diﬀraction-free Bessel beams, [1] and their gener-
alizations, focus wave modes of various types, [2] op-
tical missiles, [3] or dispersion spreading eﬀects in dis-
persive media, by exploiting the nonlinear properties of
the medium, [4] the dispersive properties of diﬀraction
gratings, [5] suitably designed Bessel-X waves, [6] or the
pseudo-dispersion-free behavior of speciﬁc pulse tempo-
ral forms. [7]

In the propagation of a transversally and temporally
localized wave in a dispersive material, both diﬀraction
and dispersion eﬀects act together, and lead, in general,
to an enhanced deterioration of the wave depth of ﬁeld.
However, as shown in this paper, it is also possible to
play oﬀ diﬀraction against dispersion during propagation
of a pulsed beam: by suitably designing its transver-
sal proﬁle, the produced diﬀraction eﬀects cancel, to a
great extent, dispersion spreading, and vice versa, lead-
ing to dispersion-free and diﬀraction-free localized propa-
gation in the dispersive medium. Speciﬁcally, diﬀraction
changes in a pulse with Bessel transversal proﬁle [8] (do
not confuse with the more known nondiﬀracting X-Bessel
waves) [9], and temporal spreading due to normal mate-
rial dispersion mutually cancel if the transversal size of
the Bessel proﬁle is properly chosen.

It is possible to arrive at this result by thinking of
diﬀraction of pulses as a dispersive phenomenon. When-
ever the pulse has a transversal proﬁle, diﬀraction causes
its redder frequencies to spread at larger angles than its
bluer frequencies, and hence to propagate at diﬀerent ef-
fective velocities along the beam axis. A detailed inves-
tigation on the dispersive nature of free-space diﬀraction

of pulses, including the description of diﬀraction fore-
runners, can be found in Ref.
[10]. Here we consider
the light disturbance E(x⊥, t) = g(x⊥)A(t) exp(−iω0t),
with x⊥ ≡ (x, y), representing a pulse of carrier fre-
quency ω0, envelope A(t), and transversal proﬁle g(x⊥),
at the entrance plane z = 0 of a dispersive mate-
rial of refraction index n(ω), which ﬁlls the half-space
z > 0. The spatial-frequency spectrum of the transver-
sal proﬁle g(x⊥) is ˆg(k⊥), with k⊥ = (kx, ky), and the
temporal-frequency spectrum of the pulse temporal form
is ˆA(ω − ω0). The propagated disturbance E(x⊥, z, t)
at any plane z > 0 inside the material can be seen as
the result of superposing the monochromatic plane waves
ˆg(k⊥) ˆA(ω − ω0) exp [−iωt + ik⊥ · x⊥ + ikz(ω)z] emitted
by the source plane, of diﬀerent frequencies ω, wavevec-
tors [k⊥, kz(ω)], with

kz(ω) =

k2(ω) − |k⊥|2,

(1)

p

and k(ω) = (ω/c)n(ω), and amplitudes ˆg(k⊥) ˆA(ω − ω0).
These monochromatic plane waves are homogeneous if
|k⊥| < k(ω), and evanescent otherwise. To perform
this superposition, we ﬁrst sum,
for convenience, all
monochromatic plane waves of diﬀerent frequencies ω but
same value of k⊥,

Ek⊥(z, t) =

dω ˆA(ω−ω0) exp[−iωt+ikz(ω)z],

ˆg(k⊥)

and then superpose these partial ﬁelds,

E(x⊥, z, t) =

dk⊥ exp(ik⊥ · x⊥)Ek⊥ (z, t).

In this way, the propagated the pulsed beam appears as
the superposition of many pulses Ek⊥ associated to the
diﬀerent spatial-frequencies k⊥ of the initial transversal
proﬁle. The propagation of these subpulses is dispersive,
not only in dispersive materials, but also in free space
[k(ω) = ω/c], since their propagation constant kz(ω) is a
nonlinear function of ω.

As in the usual theory of dispersive pulse propaga-
tion, we can expand kz(ω) around the carrier frequency,
z,0(ω − ω0)2/2 + . . . (where
kz(ω) = kz,0 + k′
the prime sign denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to ω,
and the subscript 0 evaluation at ω0), to rewrite Eq. (2),
up to second order in dispersion, as

When |k⊥| < k0, Ek⊥ (z, t) is a propagating pulse,
whose carrier oscillations travel at the phase velocity
vp = ω0/kz,0, while the envelope does at the group ve-
z,0)−1, at the same time that it broadens

1(a)]: diﬀerent frequencies ω com-
persion [see Fig.
posing the pulse Ek⊥ (z, t) propagate at diﬀerent angles
sin θ(ω) = |k⊥|/(ω/c) with respect to the z axis, and then
travel at diﬀerent eﬀective velocities along the z direc-
tion. A geometrical picture of vg and its dependence on
frequency is shown in Fig. 1(a). Free-space dispersion ex-
ists whenever there exists spatial-frequencies k⊥ 6= 0, i.e.,
the initial pulse has a transversal proﬁle, and is respon-
sible for diﬀraction changes in the pulsed beam during
propagation. Indeed, if we neglect this kind of dispersion
(ω/c)2 − |k⊥|2 ∼ ω/c, Eq.
in Eq. (2) by approaching
(3) would yield E(x⊥, z, t) = g(x⊥)A(t) exp(−iω0t), i.e.,
p
the pulsed beam would propagate without any change in
free-space.

In a dispersive material, the total GVD of Eq. (7) has
two contributions, originating from material dispersion
and diﬀraction-induced dispersion. The remarkable point
here is that for normal material dispersion (k′′
0 > 0), both
types of GVD cancel mutually for pulses Ek⊥ (z, t, ) with

Dispersion-free, diﬀraction-free pulsed beam propaga-
tion in a dispersive material can then be achieved if
the initial transversal proﬁle contains only spatial fre-
quencies satisfying condition (8). The simplest exam-
ple would be a single spatial-frequency k⊥ of modulus
K, but it does not represents a transversally localized
wave, but a tilted plane pulse. This is equivalent to the
[5] for material GVD suppression by re-
result of Ref.
ﬂection of a plane pulse in a grating of constant k⊥.
A second example, leading to transversal localization, is
the Bessel proﬁle g(x⊥) = J0(K|x⊥|), whose spectrum
˜g(k⊥) = 2π
|k⊥| δ(|k⊥| − K) is an annulus of radius K. In-
deed, Eqs. (9) and (3) for this spectrum yield the pulsed
beam with nonspreading envelope and transversal proﬁle

the propagated ﬁeld of

E(x⊥, z, t) = J0(K|x⊥|)A(t − k′

z,0z) exp(−iω0t + ikz,0z),
(10)
as
the initial disturbance
J0(K|x⊥|)A(t) exp(−iω0t). We stress that this pulsed
Bessel disturbance experiences diﬀraction changes in free
[8] (see also Fig. 2). The non-
space, as shown in Ref.
diﬀracting behavior of the pulsed Bessel beam in disper-
sive media can then be explained by the mutual cancela-
tion of diﬀraction and dispersion.

To illustrate these results, Fig. 2 shows the propa-
gation of the pulsed Bessel beam of Gaussian envelope
J0(K|x⊥|) exp(−t2/b2) exp(−iω0t) in fused silica (solid
curves), with refraction index given by Selmeier relation.
The pulse duration and carrier frequency have been cho-
sen arbitrarily to be b = 12 fs and ω0 = 1.9 fs−1 (T0 =
2π/ω0 = 3.3 fs), respectively. Since k0 = 9193 mm−1 ,
0 = 21.78 mm−1 fs2 at this fre-
0 = 4881 mm−1 fs and k′′
k′
quency, we have taken from Eq. (8) K = 839.4 mm−1 for
invariant propagation, yielding the beam width (ﬁrst zero
of the Bessel proﬁle) 2.404/K = 2.864 µm, or about three
times the carrier wavelength. For comparison, we also
show the propagation of the same pulse without transver-
sal modulation in fused silica (open dots), and of the
same pulsed Bessel beam in free-space (dots). It can be
seen that the plane pulse in silica, under the only action
of dispersion, and the pulsed Bessel beam in free-space,
under the eﬀects of diﬀraction only, have signiﬁcantly
spreaded at the dispersion length zD = b2
0 | = 3.3
mm [Fig. 2(b)]. However, the pulsed Bessel beam prop-
agating in silica under the joint action of dispersion and
diﬀraction does not experience signiﬁcant change up to
4zD ≃ 13.2 mm [Fig. 2(c)]. This limitation is due to
the total third-order dispersion k′′′
z,0, whose eﬀect be-
comes noticeable at the third-order dispersion length
b3/2|k′′′

z,0| = 11.85 mm.

Obviously, higher-order Bessel proﬁles, or the “cos”
beam (one dimensional version of the Bessel beam) will
also yield undeformable transmission. Spreading reduc-
tion is also expected to occur with other transversal pro-
ﬁles having annular spatial-frequency spectrum (though
of ﬁnite thickness), as the Bessel-Gauss, [11] other win-
dowed Bessel proﬁles, and the so-called elegant Laguerre-
Gauss beams [12]. In these cases, invariant propagation
will occur within the diﬀraction-free distance [11] (within
which these proﬁles resemble the Bessel one).

The above results must be clearly distinguished, de-
spite some coincidences, from the Bessel-X dispersionless
propagation reported in Refs.
[6], whose GVD cancela-
tion scheme is shown in Fig. 3, for comparison with Fig.
1. Sonajalg’s dispersionless pulse is built from a superlu-
minal Bessel-X pulse [Fig. 3(a)] having the nonseparable
initial disturbance ˆE(x⊥, ω) = ˆS(ω)δ[|k⊥| − k(ω) sin θ]
(k⊥ depends on frequency), instead from our separable
pulsed Bessel beam [Fig. 1(a)] ˆE(x⊥, ω) = ˆS(ω)δ[|k⊥| −
K] (k⊥ takes a ﬁxed value). With the Bessel-X pulse,
normal material GVD (for instance) can be cancelled
by slightly raising the cone angle θ of the monochro-
matic Bessel beam components with increasing frequency
[Fig. 3(b)]. Dispersion in the cone angle is supplied by
an appropriate optical system, such as an annular slit
with frequency-dependent radius and a lens, an axicon,
a lensacon plus a telescope, depending on the dispersive
material behind, or introducing some defocusing in the
lensacon.
[6] Here angular dispersion is inherent to the
Bessel proﬁle: monochromatic Bessel beams of same size
but diﬀerent frequencies have the diﬀerent cone angles
sin θ(ω) = K/k(ω) [Fig. 1(b)]. It is also to be noted that
Sonajalg’s pulse reduces to a pure nondistorted Bessel-X
wave in the limiting case of zero material GVD, whereas
our pulsed Bessel beam degenerates into a plane pulse
(K → ∞).

We have shown, in conclusion, that diﬀraction and ma-
terial dispersion spreading eﬀects can cancel one to an-
other during propagation of a pulsed beam in a dispersive
material, leading to dispersion-free, diﬀraction-free local-
ized wave transmission, if the transversal proﬁle of the
pulse is suitably selected and scaled. This result can ﬁnd
application in ultrafast spectroscopy, large distance opti-
cal communications and electromagnetic energy delivery
systems.

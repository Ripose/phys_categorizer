Abstract

The use of short lengths of large core phosphate glass ﬁbre, doped with high con-
centrations of Er or Er:Yb represents an attractive route to achieving high power
erbium doped ﬁbre ampliﬁers (EDFAs) and lasers (EDFLs). With the aim of inves-
tigating the potential of achieving diﬀraction limited output from such large core
ﬁbres, we present experimental results of fundamental mode propagation through a
20 cm length of passive 300 µm core multimode ﬁbre when the input is a well-aligned
Gaussian beam. Through careful control of ﬁbre geometry, input beam parameters
and alignment, we measured an output M 2 of 1.1 ± 0.05. The ﬁbre had a numerical
aperture of 0.389, implying a V number of 236.8. To our knowledge, this is the
largest core ﬁbre through which diﬀraction limited fundamental mode propagation
has been demonstrated. Although the results presented here relate to undoped ﬁbre,
they do provide the practical basis for a new generation of EDFAs and EDFLs.

1 Introduction

Conventional EDFAs based on single mode ﬁbre have limited power handling
characteristics. For many industrial and military applications these power lev-
els are prohibitively low. By using larger core multimode ﬁbre, power levels
can be scaled-up, avoiding non-linear eﬀects (stimulated Brillouin and Raman

scattering) and catastrophic optical damage in the core and at the end facets.
Although many research groups have investigated ampliﬁers based on multi-
mode ﬁbres [1,2], most of the ﬁbres investigated have had core diameters less
than 50 µm; and more often less than 30 µm. In practice, bend-loss or tapered
ﬁbre sections are used to ﬁlter out higher order modes. Koplow [1] showed that
the bend-loss technique becomes less eﬀective for larger core ﬁbres. Higher or-
der mode suppression in a 100 µm core ﬁbre is at least a factor of 10 lower
than that observed in the more commonly used 25-50 µm core ﬁbres.With
regard to the use of tapers, these not only ﬁlter out higher order modes but
also power. This limits the ampliﬁer gain as shown by Minelly [3].

In earlier work we have demonstrated high ﬁdelity fundamental mode prop-
agation through hollow multimode waveguides with diameters of thousands
of microns [4,5]. This was achieved by suitable control of the launch condi-
tions and waveguide linearity. Recently, we have proposed the extension of
this concept to the realisation of very large mode area (VLMA) EDFAs with
core diameters of 300 µm or more. Similar work has been carried out by W.
S. Wong et al [6] who recently demonstrated this propagation in VLMA ﬁbre
using photonic crystal ﬁbre. This exploited the natural mode selection which
arises through the use of large air holes in the ﬁbre cladding. Having an eﬀec-
tive mode ﬁeld diameter of 42.5 µm, the fundamental mode was excited and
propagated over an impressive 4 m ﬁbre length.

In 2004, Qiu et al [7] demonstrated 4 W output power, in single mode, from
a 7 cm length of Er:Yb co-doped phosphate glass ﬁbre. The same research
group (and others) has shown that phosphate glass ﬁbre is much more soluble
to erbium and ytterbium ions and thus provides signiﬁcantly higher pump
absorption per unit length of ﬁbre [8]. The result is that signiﬁcant gain and
output powers can be attained from comparatively short lengths of ﬁbre. It is
this approach, in conjunction with the aforementioned single mode propaga-
tion in multimode waveguides that is of particular interest. In this letter we
describe the potential of VLMA EDFAs and present experimental measure-
ments of the passive fundamental mode propagation characteristics of a 300
µm core multimode ﬁbre using a well-aligned Gaussian as the input beam.

2 Background

The V-number of a ﬁbre is an indicative measure of how many higher order
modes can propagate through the ﬁbre [9]. It is given by

V =

a × (NA)

(1)

2π
λ

2

where λ is the wavelength of the radiation, a is the ﬁbre core radius and NA is
the numerical aperture relating to the refractive index step between the core
and the cladding. To force a ﬁbre to only support the propagation of the lowest
order fundamental mode, the V-number must be kept at, or below 2.405 [9].
If the core diameter is increased whilst maintaining the same index-step, a
higher V-number results and the ﬁbre becomes multimode. With respect to
maintaining single mode characteristics, an increased core diameter can be
oﬀset, up to a point, by a reduced refractive index step as demonstrated by
Taverner [10] for a 20 µm core ﬁbre. However, this is only eﬀective in ﬁbres
up to a certain core size and often requires additional ﬁbre bending to achieve
single mode output. To fabricate a single mode ﬁbre with a core diameter of
100 µm using this approach is currently beyond ﬁbre processing constraints.

Even though a ﬁbre might have a multimode nature, it is still possible to excite
just the fundamental mode. This depends on the input beam proﬁle and the
way the beam is injected into the ﬁbre. Since our primary objective is to
demonstrate the propagation of the fundamental mode and not any particular
input beam, we have chosen a Gaussian beam as the input ﬁeld. In this case,
fundamental mode propagation can be achieved by holding the ﬁbre rigid and
straight, and controlling the alignment with respect to the injected Gaussian
beam. In this manner, fundamental mode propagation can be maintained over
some distance. This assumes that there are no perturbations (periodic or non-
periodic) in the ﬁbre and that the input beam-width is carefully selected to
ensure that the value of the overlap integral between the single mode input
ﬁeld and the fundamental mode of the ﬁbre is maximised. Figure 1 shows
a plot of fundamental mode power coupling coeﬃcient C(γ) as a function
of γ = w/a, the ratio of input beam (assumed Gaussian)waist w and ﬁbre
core radius a, for a 300 µm core diameter. Also shown are the values of C(γ)
for various values of γ near optimum coupling. It is evident that a Gaussian
input having a beam waist corresponding to γ ∼ 0.65 is required for optimum
coupling of power into the fundamental mode of the ﬁbre. It can be shown
that a more precise value of γ for this purpose is given by γ = 0.6463. In our
experiment, the value of γ was chosen to be 0.65.

Assuming an input beam from a laser source has a Gaussian form, it can be
shown [11] that the magnitude of the ﬁeld overlap integral with the sum of all
the guided modes of the ﬁbre (having forms of Bessel functions) has a value
of 0.99. This implies that 98% (absolute square of overlap integral) of input
power is coupled to guided modes of the ﬁbre. If the ﬁbre is aligned to the
input in both angular and longitudinal senses, then it can be further shown
through modal analysis that 99.8 % of the light coupled to the guided modes of
the ﬁbre is, in fact, coupled to the fundamental mode – the remaining 0.2 % to
low order modes LP02 and LP03. To illustrate mode-coupling as a function of
misalignment further, ﬁgure 2 shows the power coupling coeﬃcient calculated
as a function of both angular and translational misalignment of ﬁbre with

angular misalignments up to and exceeding 20 mrads. Although not shown,
signiﬁcant higher-order mode coupling (coupling coeﬃcient ∼ 0.2) occurs at
angles exceeding 100 mrad. It is therefore of vital importance that controls
are taken over these sources of misalignment and mode mismatch. We end
this section by noting that the above analysis is valid only for a Gaussian
input beam. The next section will cover the experimental realization of the
fundamental mode VLMA ﬁbre principle.

3 Experimental conﬁguration and results

As a ﬁrst step in assessing the concept, we set out to investigate if it was
possible to achieve high ﬁdelity fundamental mode excitation and propaga-
tion through a passive multimode ﬁbre. In order to achieve and maintain high
ﬁdelity fundamental mode propagation in a multimode ﬁbre, the launch con-
ditions and the linearity of the ﬁbre must be appropriately controlled. The
ﬁbre needs to be kept as straight as possible, as bending will cause the fun-
damental mode ﬁeld to be coupled to higher order modes. Fibre-guides with
a ”V” shaped cross-section were milled into the surface of a machinable ce-
ramic (Macor) substrate using computer-aided machining techniques [4]. The
ﬁbre-guides ranged in length from 5 cm to 20 cm. Lids of the same material
held the ﬁbres in position. The ﬁbre-guides accommodate ﬁbres with cladding
diameters ranging from 125 µm up to 1500 µm. A ﬁbre (mounted in such a
ﬁbre-guide) was held in position on a commercially available Newport trans-
lation stage (565-XYZ-TILT) with ﬁve degrees of freedom: three translational
(with a resolution of ∼ 0.1 µm), and two angular (with a resolution of ∼ 2
µrad). The ﬁbre used in this experiment was supplied by Thorlabs (FT-300-
EMT) and had a 300 µm core diameter and 325 µm cladding diameter. The
value of NA was 0.389. The tolerance on the outer diameter of the polymer
coating was 30 µm, which was a factor of three worse than that of the silica
inner cladding. For this reason, the polymer coating was removed in order to
minimise micro bending from this source.

Prior to mounting in the ﬁbre-guide, the ﬁbre end faces were cleaved and
polished to a surface ﬂatness of ∼ λ/30 at 1550 nm. This prevented phase
distortion of the fundamental mode input ﬁeld.

The large V number of the ﬁbre leads to a strong conﬁnement of the ﬁeld
within the core. In this context, the input beam was chosen to have a diameter
which ensured optimum coupling to the ﬁbre. Through numerical analysis of
overlap integrals between input ﬁeld and the fundamental mode of the ﬁbre,
it was predicted that an input beam with a 1/e2 mode ﬁeld diameter of 0.646
of the ﬁbre core diameter, would provide optimum power coupling to the
fundamental mode of the ﬁbre.

A ﬁbre-coupled 1550 nm diode laser (Alcatel A1905 LMI 30mW) was focussed
via a 10X microscope objective to achieve a beam waist of 195 µm (0.65 X 300
µm). At the output end of the ﬁbre, a second microscope objective was used to
produce a magniﬁed image of the emerging ﬁeld onto a “Gentec BeamR” beam
proﬁler. A Hamamatsu vidicon camera was also used for additional analysis of
the ﬁbre output. A schematic of the experimental conﬁguration is illustrated
in ﬁgure 3. The output from the ﬁbre laser obviously couples to some free-
space Hermite-Gaussian mode which we assume to very closely approximate
to a quasi-Gaussian ﬁeld proﬁle at the multimode ﬁbre input.

had a near Gaussian-form. A measured M2 value of 1.1 ± 0.05 conﬁrmed that
eﬃcient fundamental mode propagation had been achieved in practice. The

proﬁles shown represent orthogonal axes of measurement. The slight asym-
metry between them is most likely due to some higher order mode content,
which is of such low amplitude that it does not have signiﬁcantly adverse eﬀect
on the measured M2 parameter. Similar values of M2 were measured for ﬁbre
lengths of 5, 10, and 15 cm. These experiments were repeated for a 105 µm
core diameter multimode ﬁbre (again, commercially available from Thorlabs
– AFS105/125Y) which gave comparable results, i.e. M2 of ∼1.1 for lengths
up to 20 cm.

These results are very encouraging, oﬀering a proof-of-principle that highly
multimode ﬁbre, capable of supporting in excess of 28,000 (∼V2/2) modes
can be conﬁgured in conjunction with a suitable input ﬁeld, such that only its
fundamental mode is excited and propagated throughout its length. We did
not observe any deterioration in beam quality with length for ﬁbres ranging
from 5 cm to 20 cm, indicating longer lengths of ﬁbre would also support the
fundamental mode only. One might well ask whether the comparatively short
ﬁbre lengths considered here are transmitting the light in the form of a guided
mode, or whether the ﬁbre is so large as to be simply acting as a piece of bulk
silica transmitting the light. However, it is worth noting that the Rayleigh
range of a 195 µm diameter input beam entering the ﬁbre is only 1.9 cm. In
view of this, we can be conﬁdent that the light is indeed transmitted in a
guided mode.

Figure 5 (a) shows an analytically generated image of the ﬁeld corresponding to
the fundamental mode of a ﬁbre of the same speciﬁcation as used here. Figure

is the same output as illustrated in ﬁgure 4. The white circle encompassing
the ﬁeld distributions in all plots represents the core cladding interface. A
20 cm length of the same 300 µm core ﬁbre was located in a ﬁbre guide of

7

inferior quality, such that the ﬁbre was not held straight. Additionally, the
end faces were cleaved but not polished. All other parameters were kept the
same. The resulting output ﬁeld is shown in ﬁgure 5 (c), which illustrates
the highly multimode nature of the ﬁbre, with signiﬁcant higher order mode
content. This also conﬁrms the necessity of the controls we have taken over
ﬁbre linearity and minimisation of mode coupling.

4 Conclusions

We have experimentally demonstrated that a 300 µm core multimode ﬁbre
can support high ﬁdelity fundamental mode (LP01) propagation over lengths
of 20 cm or more. Since there was no variance in the output mode quality with
length from 5 cm to 20 cm, there is every reason to believe that ﬁbre lengths
can be extended to 40 cm and still produce near diﬀraction-limited output
beams. Although the technical discussions outlined here relate to ampliﬁer
applications, laser conﬁgurations should also be feasible with suﬃcient controls
over preferential mode lasing [12].

With regard to non-linear scattering, a 300 µm core, 30 cm long EDFA would
be capable of handling 30 kW optical power before reaching threshold for
stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). From a thermal damage perspective, it
is accepted that a conservative damage threshold for rare earth doped ﬁbre is
∼1 W/µm2 [13]. For a 300 µm core EDFA, this equates to a damage threshold
of almost 70 kW. Although these ﬁgures are unlikely to be practically realised
in EDFAs of this nature, they do illustrate the utility of larger core ﬁbres in
overcoming the limiting factors in conventional ﬁbre power ampliﬁers. Heat
generation from the quantum defect in EDFAs and fracture limits would be the
ﬁrst limit reached in ﬁbres such as those presented here, with a limit of around
800 W expected for a ﬁbre of this length based on parameters presented in
previous work [14,15].

Provided rare-earth doped ﬁbres behave similarly to the ﬁbre described in
this letter in terms of mode propagation, this would appear to oﬀer a way of
developing, in a master oscillator power ampliﬁer (MOPA) conﬁguration, a
high power, compact and robust, single-mode ampliﬁer, without the need for
ﬁbre coiling.

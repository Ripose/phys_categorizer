Comment on “Information Capacity of Optical
Fiber Channels with Zero Average Dispersion”

It is an important problem, both theoretically and
practically, to calculate or estimate the information ca-
pacity of a nonlinear channel. In a recent Letter [1] by
Turitsyn et al., two models of noisy nonlinear ﬁber chan-
nels with zero average dispersion have been analyzed, and
the spectral eﬃciency C is estimated to increase asymp-
totically as C ≥ 1
2 log2(S/N ) + O(1) at high signal-to-
noise ratio S/N , in sharp contrast to previous results
that predict the channel capacity to peak and then fall
oﬀ as signal power increases [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. While previous
works relied on approximations, Ref.[1] used elegant ﬁeld-
theoretic formulations and techniques to analytically cal-
culate the conditional probability density function, and
rigorously derived a lower bound for the asymptotic chan-
nel capacity. However, the essential diﬀerence between
Ref.[1] and previous works may not be in the mathemat-
ical approaches, rather, it may lie in subtle but crucial
details of the physical models. In particular, the models
in Ref.[1] incorporate no bandwidth-limiting mechanism
during transmission or at the end of it, hence are lim-
ited in applicability to practical ﬁber channels, where
such bandwidth-limiting mechanisms are always present
to slow down the growth of channel capacity as signal
power rises.

Although not explicitly stated, both models of Ref.[1]
do tacitly assume spectral conservation of signal and
noise within a band of width W , which is not (or yet
to be) justiﬁed, and may not correctly reﬂect the actual
physics of nonlinear channels. On one hand, no math-
ematical function or distribution of a signal is known
to preserve its spectrum within a given frequency band
when undergoing noisy nonlinear propagation. On the
other hand, it has become an empirical law that non-
linearity in conjunction with noise always mix signals to
generate new frequency components [6]. Solitons may
be the closest to spectral preserving among known wave-
forms. But it is impractical to establish a single soliton
channel utilizing the entire bandwidth of a ﬁber transmis-
sion line, while wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM)
solitons interact and mix with noise to generate out-of-
band spectral components. Furthermore, soliton trans-
missions require ﬁber lines with nonzero average disper-
sion, which escape from the analytical solution [1]. Even
frequency- or phase-modulated signals that might prop-
agate undistorted under Kerr nonlinearity, the additive
noise would cause intensity ﬂuctuations and eventually
spectral broadening. In conclusion, the physical models
in Ref.[1] may not be suitable for practical ﬁber chan-
nels, and the question remains open whether the capac-
ity could grow unbounded with increasing S/N for noisy,

nonlinear, and bandlimited channels. A more realistic
model may include distributed frequency ﬁltering to the
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation, in addition to distribu-
tive noise. But then the solvability of the channel and its
capacity remain open problems.

Nevertheless, Ref.[1] has served greatly as a reminder
to the trivial but often overlooked fact, that the capac-
ity can never decrease as the permitted but not had to
be reached bound of signal power increases. Falling oﬀ
of capacity after peaking [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] simply indicates
inapplicability of either physical models or mathemat-
ical approximations. Ref.[2] used an overly restrictive
model where WDM channels are not demodulated or
processed in a correlated manner. Ref.[5] treated Kerr
nonlinearity as perturbation, which naturally ceases to
apply when the signal power is high. As well demon-
strated [1], the use of Pinsker’s formula as done in Refs.[3]
and [4] is prone to error.
In particular, the channel
model of nonlinear but dispersionless propagation fol-
lowed by noise addition at the end for a single-span sys-
tem [3] admits a trivial proof of unbounded capacity.
The Kerr nonlinearity in such channel becomes oblivious
when constant-intensity modulations such as frequency-
or phase-shift keying are used. Such particular modula-
tions may fail to realize the ultimate capacity, but would
deﬁnitely establish an asymptotic spectral eﬃciency of
constant × log2(S/N ) at high S/N , just as they do for a
normal linear channel [7].

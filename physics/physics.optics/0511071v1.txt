Vacuum or matter–free space is the most widely
studied electromagnetic medium, not only because
it underlies the development of continuum electro-
magnetic properties from microscopic principles [1,
2], but also because of the signiﬁcance of electro-
magnetic communication devices in modern society
[3]. The electromagnetic constitutive equations of
vacuum are commonly stated in textbooks as

D(r, t) = ǫ0 E(r, t) ,
B(r, t) = µ0 H(r, t) ,

where ǫ0 = 8.854

These equations presuppose either the absence
of a gravitational ﬁeld or that the observer is local.
When a gravitational ﬁeld is present, spacetime ap-
pears curved — which is well–known [4]. One can
still use the textbook versions of the Maxwell pos-
tulates for gravitationally aﬀected vacuum, but the
constitutive relations are now [5, 6]

The coordinate system has been chosen such that
γ(ω) is diagonal, and from now onwards the depen-
dence on ω is implicit.

The frequency–domain Maxwell curl postulates

in the chosen medium may be set down as

in lieu of (1) and (2). Here γ(r, t) is a real symmet-
ric dyadic and Γ(r, t) is a vector with real–valued
components, both related to the metric of space-
time; whereas c0 = 1/√ǫ0µ0.

Just as isotropic dielectric–magnetic mediums
provide material counterparts of (1) and (2) in the
frequency domain [1, 7], the vast variety of com-
plex materials [8, 9] — natural as well as artiﬁ-
cial — suggests that it is quite possible that (3) and
(4) also have material counterparts. This thought
inspired the present communication, wherein we
present the derivation of the dyadic Green func-
tion for frequency–domain electromagnetic ﬁelds in
a homogeneous medium inspired by (3) and (4).

With the assumption that all ﬁelds have an
iωt) time dependence, with ω as the angular
exp(
frequency, the constitutive relations of the chosen
medium are

For that purpose, following Lakhtakia & Welgl-

current density as

Next, we make use of an aﬃne transformation

associated with the scaling of space as per [11]

˜r = γ1/2 • r ,

(17)

where γ1/2 • γ1/2 = γ and we recall that γ is a
dyadic with real–valued elements. Let us deﬁne an-
other set of ﬁelds and source current density as
˜e(r) = γ1/2 • e(γ1/2 • r) ,

1/2 • h(γ

where ‘adj’ stands for the adjoint. Then, (15) and
(16) transform to

˜e(r) = iωµ0 g ˜h(r) ,
˜h(r) =

iωǫ0 g ˜e(r) + ˜j(r) ,

Green function for gravitationally unaﬀected vac-
uum [12].

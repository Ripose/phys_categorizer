Abstract

The frequency of a 700 mW monolithic non-planar
Nd:YAG ring laser (NPRO) depends with a large cou-
pling coeﬃcient (some MHz/mW) on the power of its
laser-diode pump source. Using this eﬀect we demon-
strate the frequency stabilization of an NPRO to a fre-
quency reference by feeding back to the current of its
pump diodes.

We achieved an error point frequency noise smaller
than 1 mHz/√Hz, and simultaneously a reduction of the
power noise of the NPRO by 10 dB without an additional
power stabilization feed-back system.

Due to the demanding requirements of recent experi-
ments in quantum optics, laser spectroscopy and laser
metrology there has been much interest in laser stabi-
lization over the last years. Although very good stabil-
ity was achieved with Ar+ lasers1, diode-laser pumped
solid-state lasers were chosen for almost all modern high-
precision experiments. The reason for this choice is
that the free-running frequency noise of these lasers is
2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than for Ar+ lasers,
and the intensity noise of solid-states-laser is also much
lower. Furthermore, solid-state lasers have a very high
electrical-to-optical eﬃciency, which is important espe-
cially in space applications like inter-satellite communi-
cation or high power applications as laser interferometric
gravitational wave detectors.

Many of these experiments rely on the high in-
trinsic stability of Nd:YAG non-planar ring oscillators
(NPRO)2, the output of which is used in the experiment
directly or is ampliﬁed either by injection locking3–5
or in a conﬁguration with master oscillator and power
ampliﬁer6. The free-running frequency noise spectral
density of NPROs is of the order of 1 kHz/√Hz at 10 Hz
and falls like 1/f at higher frequencies. The unstabilized
power noise of such lasers has a level of 10−7/√Hz. Al-

1

though this intrinsic stability is quite high, experiments
like gravitational wave detectors require a frequency sta-
bility in the mHz/√Hz range, and simultaneously the
power noise needs to be reduced by at least an order of
magnitude.

The commonly used schemes to reduce the frequency
noise of NPROs rely on stabilizing the laser frequency
to a ﬁxed-spacer reference cavity or an atomic resonance
by feeding back to two diﬀerent actuators: the tempera-
ture of the Nd:YAG crystal in the low Fourier frequency
range below 1 Hz, and for higher frequencies to a piezo-
electrical transducer (PZT) mounted on top of the crys-
tal that changes the laser frequency due to stress-induced
birefringence. The resonances of the PZT above 100 kHz
limit the useful bandwidth of the latter actuator. Good
results were achieved especially by using an additional
external phase shifter (Pockels cell) as a fast actuator to
increase the unity gain frequency of the feed-back con-
trol loop up to 1 MHz. For example Bondu et al.7 report
a frequency noise spectral density below 10−4 Hz/√Hz
with respect to the reference cavity (in-loop) and in the
order of 10−2 Hz/√Hz with respect to an independent
cavity (out-of-loop).

Although these results already meet the demanding
requirements of ﬁrst generation gravitational wave de-
tectors, no attention was paid to the power noise and
spatial beam ﬂuctuations. Currently performed cross
coupling measurements8 predict a non-negligible point-
ing and also power noise introduced by feeding a sig-
nal to the NPRO’s PZT. Furthermore, care has to be
taken that residual amplitude modulation of the phase-
correcting Pockels cell does not compromize the shot
noise limited performance of the NPRO in the frequency
range above 5 MHz, which is essential for the hetero-
dyne detection scheme used in many experiments. On
the other hand the power stabilization scheme normally
employed adds a signal to the current of the pump source
of the NPRO, which has the undesired eﬀect of changing
the NPRO frequency. These problems together with the
understanding of the fact that the free-running frequency
noise of the NPRO is mainly due to power ﬂuctuations

of the laser-diode pump source9 led us towards the new
stabilization scheme. (A related scheme with a separate
heating laser was used by Heilmann et al.10 to stabilize
a twisted-mode-cavity laser.)

Figure 1 shows a sketch of the experimental setup. A
700 mW NPRO built by Laser Zentrum Hannover was
mode-matched to a high-ﬁnesse ﬁxed-spacer ring cav-
ity made from ultra-low-expansion material (ULE). This
resonator has a ﬁnesse of 58 000 and is put in a vacuum
tank to avoid contamination and acoustic disturbances.

under this condition the Pound-Drever-Hall error signal
is proportional to the diﬀerence frequency δω = ωL − ωC
between laser and cavity resonance. To measure Tcur→ω,
which is shown in Figure 2, we summed the source sig-
nal of a network analyzer with Fourier frequency above
the unity gain frequency of the servo to the laser-diode
pump-current and measured the change of the laser fre-
quency at the error point of the Pound-Drever-Hall cir-
cuit.

Fig. 1.

Schematic of the experimental setup. An NPRO
is stabilized to a rigid-spacer reference cavity by using the
Pound-Drever-Hall scheme to achieve an error signal for the
control loop feeding back to the current of the NPRO’s pump
diode.

Before entering the cavity the light passes through a
Faraday isolator to avoid back-reﬂections of the light
into the laser and is transmitted through an electro-
optical modulator (EOM). The EOM was driven by an
rf-oscillator at ωmod = 29 MHz to produce phase modu-
lation sidebands on the light. Once the laser frequency
ωL is near a resonance ωC of the cavity, an asymme-
try between these sidebands and the reﬂected carrier
produces an amplitude modulation of the light at ωmod
which then, detected by an InGaAs photodiode and de-
modulated at ωmod, gives an error signal for the fre-
quency stabilization servo system. A phase shifter be-
tween the rf-oscillator and mixer is used in this well es-
tablished Pound-Drever-Hall locking scheme11 to opti-
mize the slope of the frequency error signal.

To measure the transfer function Tcur→ω between a
signal added to the current of the pump diodes and the
frequency of the NPRO we ﬁrst locked the laser to the
reference cavity using the conventional method of feeding
the ﬁltered error signal back to the PZT frequency actu-
ator of the NPRO. The gain of this feed-back loop was
reduced to give a unity gain frequency of only 100 Hz.
This servo was necessary to keep the laser frequency
within the central part of the cavity linewidth, as only

Fig. 2.

Transfer function Tcur→ω of a signal summed to
the current of the NPRO’s pump diode and the NPRO fre-
quency. Power ﬂuctuations of the pump diodes together with
this strong coupling are responsible for the free-running laser
frequency noise and allows the frequency stabilization of an
NPRO by changing the power of its pump source.

According to a model by Day et al.9 this coupling is
due to thermally induced changes of the optical path
length in the laser crystal. By calculating the optical
path length change of a typical NPRO crystal due to
sinusoidial power ﬂuctuations of its pump diode, Day
et al. were able to model the transfer function Tcur→ω
with good agreement to the experimental result between
100 Hz and 100 kHz. Furthermore by assuming a ﬂat
spectral density of the power ﬂuctuations of the pump
LDs their model was able to predict the free-running
frequency ﬂuctuations of the NPRO. Our measurements
in Figure 2 shows Tcur→ω to Fourier frequencies up to
1 MHz, and particularly in the frequency range of the
NPRO’s relaxation oscillation frequency.
It is worth
mentioning that the power ﬂuctuations of the pump LD
which drive the relaxation oscillations cause a resonant
response not only in the NPRO power but also in its
frequency. This is clearly not a thermal eﬀect but prob-
ably due to changes in the index of refraction caused by
oscillations in the atomic polarization of the active laser
medium.

Based on this transfer function we designed a control
system to lock the laser frequency ωL to the cavity res-
onance ωC by feeding back to the pump LD current.

ations δω = ωL − ωC.

frequency ﬂuctuations by changing the index of refrac-
tion of the crystal but do not change the laser power.
As the spatial distribution of the power ﬂuctuations is
not constant over the beam proﬁle of the laser-diode bar,
the correlation between the power and frequency ﬂuctu-
ations of the NPRO caused by pump-power ﬂuctuations
is not perfect.

Fig. 4.

Spectral density of the power ﬂuctuations of a
monolithic Nd:YAG laser. The upper curve (at low Fourier
frequencies) shows the noise of the unstabilized laser and the
middle curve was measured while the laser frequency was
stabilized using the current lock. Both measurements were
taken without any dedicated active intensity stabilization.
The lower straight line corresponds to the shot noise limit of
this measurement.

To summarize: we have introduced a new scheme to
stabilize the frequency of an NPRO laser which only uses
the built-in laser-diode current actuator. One advan-
tage of this method in comparison with the conventional
scheme is the much simpler controller needed. Only low
voltage feed-back electronics is used and no cross-over
has to be designed between the PZT and an external
Pockels cell actuator, both of which need notoriously
noisy high-voltage ampliﬁers. Furthermore, beam point-
ing and power ﬂuctuations which are introduced by the
PZT could be avoided.

The detection of the frequency noise is a non-
demolition measurement of the NPRO power ﬂuctua-
tions and should in principle avoid the 3 dB penalty that
is the minimum to be paid in conventional power sta-
bilization servos12. However, more investigations are
needed to clarify why the power noise reduction in our
experiment was smaller than expected.

Fig. 3.

Frequency noise spectral density of the mono-
lithic Nd:YAG laser relative to a rigid-spacer reference cavity.
The upper curve shows the free running noise and the middle
curve is a measurement taken at the error point of a feedback
loop that stabilizes the laser frequency by feeding back to the
current driving its laser-diode pump source. The lower curve
represents the electronic noise of the measurements.

The upper curve shows the free-running frequency
noise of the NPRO and the lower curve was measured
at the error point of the closed frequency stabilization
loop. The bandwidth of this control system was 80 kHz
and the frequency ﬂuctuations could be reduced to below
10 mHz/√Hz for Fourier frequencies below 2 kHz, which
is comparable to the noise reduction we could achieve
with a conventional split control loop feeding back to
the laser PZT and also a phase correcting Pockels cell
behind the laser.

Due to the coupling between the laser frequency and
the power of the LD pump source, the frequency mea-
surement simultaneously measures the power ﬂuctua-
tions of the pump LD integrated over the spatial proﬁle
of the laser gain. Therefore this frequency servo simul-
taneously reduces the power noise of the NPRO. Fig-
ure 4 shows the power noise with and without frequency
servo closed. Although the noise is reduced signiﬁcantly,
there is less noise reduction than the servo-system gain
would suggest. This is probably due to the fact that the
spatial overlap between the laser volume and the pump
volume is not perfect. This means that a fraction of the
absorbed pump-light can deposit heat in the Nd:YAG
crystal but does not change the gain in the laser vol-
ume. Hence ﬂuctuations of this pump light may cause

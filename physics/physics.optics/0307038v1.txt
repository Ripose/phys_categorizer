Some physically interesting properties and eﬀects of wave propagation in biaxially anisotropic
left-handed materials are investigated in this paper. We show that in the biaxially gyrotropic left-
handed material, the left-right coupling of circularly polarized light arises due to the negative indices
in permittivity and permeability tensors of gyrotropic media. It is well known that the geometric
phases of photons inside a curved ﬁber in previous experiments often depend on the cone angles
of solid angles subtended by a curve traced by the direction of wave vector of light, at the center
of photon momentum space. Here, however, for the light propagating inside certain anisotropic
left-handed media we will present a diﬀerent geometric phase that is independent of the cone angles.
The extra phases of electromagnetic wave resulting from the instantaneous helicity inversion at the
interfaces between left- and right- handed (LRH) media is also studied in detail by using the Lewis-
Riesenfeld invariant theory. Some interesting applications (e.g., controllable position-dependent
frequency shift, detection of quantum-vacuum geometric phases and helicity reversals at the LRH
interfaces etc.) of above eﬀects and phenomena in left-handed media is brieﬂy discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

−

More recently, a kind of artiﬁcial composite metamaterials (the so-called left-handed media) having a frequency
band where the eﬀective permittivity and the eﬀective permeability are simultaneously negative attracts considerable
attention of many authors both experimentally and theoretically [1–7]. In 19671, Veselago ﬁrst considered this peculiar
medium and showed from Maxwellian equations that such media having negative simultaneously negative ǫ and µ
exhibit a negative index of refraction, i.e., n =
√ǫµ [8]. It follows from the Maxwell’s curl equations that the phase
velocity of light wave propagating inside this medium is pointed opposite to the direction of energy ﬂow, that is, the
Poynting vector and wave vector of electromagnetic wave would be antiparallel, i.e., the vector k, the electric ﬁeld
E and the magnetic ﬁeld H form a left-handed system; thus Veselago referred to such materials as “left-handed”
media, and correspondingly, the ordinary medium in which k, E and H form a right-handed system may be termed
the “right-handed” one. Other authors call this class of materials “negative-index media (NIM)” [9], “double negative
It is readily veriﬁed that in such media having both ε and µ negative,
media (DNM)” [4] and Veselago’s media.
there exist a number of peculiar electromagnetic and optical properties, for instance, many dramatically diﬀerent
propagation characteristics stem from the sign change of the optical refractive index and phase velocity, including
reversal of both the Doppler shift and Cherenkov radiation, anomalous refraction, modiﬁed spontaneous emission
rates and even reversals of radiation pressure to radiation tension [2]. In experiments, this artiﬁcial negative electric
permittivity media may be obtained by using the array of long metallic wires (ALMWs) [10], which simulates the
plasma behavior at microwave frequencies, and the artiﬁcial negative magnetic permeability media may be built up by
using small resonant metallic particles, e.g., the split ring resonators (SRRs), with very high magnetic polarizability

Note that, in the literature, some authors [5,6] mentioned the year when Veselago suggested the left-handed media by mistake.
They claimed that Veselago proposed or introduced the concept of left-handed media in 1968 or 1964. On the contrary, the
true history is as follows: Veselago’s excellent paper was ﬁrst published in Russian in July, 1967 [Usp. Fiz. Nauk 92, 517-526
(1967)]. This original paper was translated into English by W.H. Furry and published again in 1968 in the journal of Sov.
Phys. Usp. [8]. Unfortunately, Furry stated erroneously in his English translation that the original version of Veselago’ work
was ﬁrst published in 1964.

[11–13]. A combination of the two structures yields a left-handed medium. Recently, Shelby et al. reported their ﬁrst
experimental realization of this artiﬁcial composite medium, the permittivity and permeability of which have negative
real parts [3]. One of the potential applications of negative refractive index materials is to fabricate the so-called
“superlenses” (perfect lenses): speciﬁcally, a slab of such materials may has the power to focus all Fourier components
of a 2D image, even those that do not propagate in a radiative manner [14,15].

In the present paper, we take into consideration the physical phenomena and eﬀects of circularly polarized photons
in biaxially anisotropic (gyrotropic) left-handed media. Veselago’s original paper and most of the recent theoretical
works discussed mainly the characteristics of electromagnetic wave propagation through isotropic left-handed media,
but up to now, the left-handed media that have been prepared successfully experimentally are actually anisotropic in
nature, and it may be very diﬃcult to prepare an isotropic left-handed medium [1,16,17]. Hu and Chui presented a
detailed investigation on the characteristics of electromagnetic wave propagation in uniaxially anisotropic left-handed
media [17], but they concentrated primarily on the classical properties of wave propagation from the point of view of
classical wave optics and applied electromagnetism. During the last three years, many researchers in various ﬁelds such
as materials science, condensed matter physics, optics and classical applied electromagnetism [1–4,12] investigated
many peculiar optical and electromagnetic properties in left-handed media. However, to the best of our knowledge,
some physical properties (particularly the purely quantum-mechanical eﬀects) of polarized photons in left-handed
media have not been considered yet. We think that, in the literature, these problems get less attention and interest
than it deserves. For this reason, in this paper, these physically interesting properties, phenomena and eﬀects of wave
propagation (polarized photons) in biaxially anisotropic left-handed materials are investigated in detail.

This paper is organized as follows: in Sec.II, we consider the left-right (L-R) coupling of circularly polarized light in
biaxially gyrotropic left-handed media; in Sec.III, it is shown that the geometric phase of photons in a noncoplanarly
curved optical ﬁber fabricated from biaxially anisotropic left-handed media is independent of the cone angle of solid
angles subtended by a curve traced by the direction of wave vector of light at the center of photon momentum space.
A scheme of testing quantum-vacuum geometric phases by using certain biaxially anisotropic left-handed media is also
brieﬂy discussed in this section; an additional phase acquired by the incident electromagnetic wave near the interfaces
between left- and right- handed (LRH) media is investigated in detail in Sec.IV, where we argue that, if, for example,
the photons propagating inside a ﬁber that is composed periodically of left- and right- handed (LRH) media, then a
new geometric phase of photons due to helicity inversion will arise. In Sec.V, we conclude with some remarks.

II. LEFT-RIGHT COUPLING OF CIRCULARLY POLARIZED LIGHT IN BIAXIALLY GYROTROPIC
LEFT-HANDED MEDIA

A. Wave propagation in biaxially gyrotropic left-handed media

It is well known that in ordinary uniaxially gyrotropic media with the electric permittivity and the magnetic

permeability tensors being of the form

is seen that the two circular modes have diﬀerent refractive indices. This is referred to as double circular refraction
or circular birefringence. Note that here both left- and right- handed circularly polarized light are the eigenmodes of
the permittivity and permeability tensors (2.1). So, EL and ER propagate independently in the above conventional
uniaxially gyrotropic media, i.e., no interaction between them exists in the wave propagation process.

L = (ǫ1 −

µ2) and n2

Now we study a completely diﬀerent case compared with the one discussed above, namely, it is shown that an
interaction between left- and right- handed circularly polarized light is present in the wave propagation inside biaxially
gyrotropic materials with left-handed media involved. If, for example, the permittivity and permeability tensors of
the medium considered are written in the form

For simplicity, without loss of generality, we assume that the two mutually perpendicular real unit polarization vectors
~ε(k, 1) and ~ε(k, 2) are taken to be as follows: ε1(k, 1) = ε2(k, 2) = 1, ε1(k, 2) = ε2(k, 1) = 0 and ε3(k, 1) = ε3(k, 2) = 0.
It is readily veriﬁed that the electric ﬁeld vectors corresponding to left- and right- handed circularly polarized light
are respectively expressed by EL = E1
[18]. It should be noted that since here E1 and E2 are
√2
complex, EL cannot be considered the complex conjugation of ER. From Eq.(2.4) it follows that the wave equations of
left- and right- handed polarized light propagating inside the biaxially gyrotropic left-handed materials are obtained
as follows

where n2 and ζ2 are taken n2 = ǫ1µ1 + ǫ2µ2, ζ2 = ǫ2µ1 −
ǫ1µ2. Thus the above equations show that the coupling of
left-handed light to the right-handed one arises from both the gyrotropic and left-handed properties of materials. This
interaction can be treated by introducing two frequency shifts (ΩL and ΩR) to the electromagnetic wave amplitudes,
namely, EL and ER can be written in the following form [19]

where it has been assumed that the waves propagate along the ˆz-direction in Cartesian coordinate system.

It is worth noticing that, diﬀering from the double circular refraction expressed in (2.2), where EL and ER have the
same frequency but diﬀerent optical refractive indices, here, on the contrary, the two modes in (2.6) have the same
refractive index but diﬀerent frequencies. The latter case may therefore be considered a time analogue to the former
one.

Substitution of these two expressions (2.6) into the wave equations (2.5) yields

n4(2ω + ΩL)(2ω + ΩR)ΩLΩR + ζ4(ω + ΩL)2(ω + ΩR)2 = 0,

(2.7)

which is a restriction imposed on the two frequency shifts ΩL and ΩR.

It should be noted that the above-presented treatment of wave propagation in generalized gyrotropic media may be
applicable to the uniaxially anisotropic left-handed materials and this kind of media will also give rise to the left-right
coupling of circularly polarized light. The permittivity and permeability tensors of uniaxially gyrotropic left-handed
media, which can be actually fabricated by current technology [17], are written

where the parameters (i.e., ǫ, ǫ′, µ and µ′) in the tensors are all positive. It is apparently seen that the L-R coupling
of polarized light is present in this type of materials.

Additionally, note that in both biaxially gyroelectric (with µ2=0) and gyromagnetic (with ǫ2=0) left-handed media,

the above left-right coupling of polarized light will also occur.

B. Discussions: nonlocal eﬀects and potential applications

What is the physical origin of left-right coupling of polarized light in biaxially gyrotropic left-handed media? Here
we oﬀer an interpretation as to why this eﬀect might occur via nonlocal polarization eﬀect and left-handed properties

(negative index) of media: speciﬁcally, neither left- nor right- handed circularly polarized light is the eigenmode of the
permittivity and permeability tensors (2.3). For this reason, the interaction between left- and right- handed circularly
polarized light may arise in this type of media.

The electric-dipole approximation method shows that if the optical wavelength λ is large compared with the
dimension ι of the polarizable units (e.g., electric dipoles), then the induced polarization at a point will only be a
spatially local function of the electric ﬁeld at the same point. This phenomenon often appears in isotropic media,
where certain optical eﬀects associated with the small ratio ι
λ can be ignored. In anisotropic media, however, the
spatial variations of the ﬁelds over the polarizable units (i.e., the magnetic dipoles and electric quadrupoles that are
induced by the applied external ﬁelds) should also be taken into account. This generalized polarization, the physical
quantity of which is no longer denoted by a local function of the electromagnetic ﬁelds, will also oscillate and emit
radiation which adds to the contribution from the oscillating electric dipoles. It is known that the spatial nonlocality
(spatial dispersion) of generalized polarization in electromagnetic media leads to the natural optical activity (natural
gyrotropy), which results from the lowest-higher nonlocal terms in the expansion series of induced polarization, and
some electro-optical eﬀects and magnetic-ﬁeld induced gyrotropies, which arises from the terms with a higher-order
nonlocality [20]. In the electro-optical eﬀects (e.g., the Pockels eﬀect and Kerr eﬀect) and magnetic-ﬁeld induced
gyrotropy (i.e., the Faraday rotation eﬀect), the anisotropism of permittivity and permeability is often considered
the nonlinear optical phenomenon (nonlinear polarization eﬀect), since the electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths occur
more than once in the nonlocal terms of expansion of induced polarization.

We think that the L-R coupling of polarized light can be regarded as the nonlocal optical eﬀect in character. But
this coupling does not appear in regular gyrotropic media, the electromagnetic response of which is described by
(2.1), where both the left- and the right- handed circularly polarized light are the eigenmodes of the permittivity
and permeability tensors and no interaction between these eigenmodes occurs. Only the gyrotropic anisotropism of
permittivity and permeability is combined with left-handed features of media (where neither the left- nor the right-
handed circularly polarized light is the eigenmode of the permittivity and permeability tensors) will the L-R coupling
of polarized light be realized.
In brief, the physical origin of L-R coupling of polarized light lies in the nonlocal
polarization and left-handed properties of media.

Generally speaking, it follows from the Kramers-Kronig relation that the permittivity and permeability of composite
materials are often both dispersive and absorptive. If the imaginary parts of optical constants ǫ1,2 and µ1,2 in (2.3)
are not small in comparison with their real parts, then ζ2 is a complex number and consequently both ΩL and ΩR
are complex also. This, therefore, means that the electromagnetic wave amplitudes EL and ER will exponentially
decrease in the time evolution process, rather than only along the path.

In what follows we consider a potential application of L-R coupling to controlling the behavior of lightwave, i.e.,
the so-called controllable position-dependent frequency shift in certain inhomogeneous media, e.g., photonic crystals
composed of such anisotropic left-handed media. Photonic crystals are artiﬁcial materials patterned with a periodicity
in dielectric constant, which can create a range of forbidden frequencies called a photonic band gap [21,22]. Such
dielectric structure of crystals oﬀers the possibility of molding the ﬂow of light. It follows from (2.5) that if both
∂z and ∂ζ
∂n
∂z are negligibly small, then the frequency shifts ΩL and ΩR of LRH polarized light due to the left-right
coupling depend upon the spatial position in photonic crystals. This enables us to control the frequencies of circularly
polarized light by making use of the spatial structures (or distribution) of optical refractive indices in crystals.

In addition, it is believed that the inﬂuence of L-R coupling of polarized light on the photonic band gap structure
is of physical interest and therefore deserves investigation, since both the wave vector and the frequency of light are
dependent on the spatial positions in this kind of biaxially gyrotropic left-handed photonic crystals.

III. GEOMETRIC PHASES INDEPENDENT OF CONE ANGLE

Since Berry discovered that a topological (geometric) phase exists in quantum mechanical wave function of time-
dependent systems [23], geometric phase problems have captured intensive attention of researchers in a variety of
ﬁelds such as quantum mechanics [24], diﬀerential geometry [25], gravity theory [26,27], atomic and molecular physics
[28–30], nuclear physics [31], quantum optics [32], condensed matter physics [33,34], molecular structures and molecular
chemical reaction [28] as well. More recently, many authors concentrated on their special attention on the potential
applications of geometric phases to the geometric (topological) quantum computation, quantum decoherence and
related topics [35,36]. One of the most interesting realizations of Berry’s phase (i.e., cyclic adiabatic geometric phase)
is the propagation of photons inside a helically curved optical ﬁber, which was ﬁrst proposed by Chiao and Wu [37],
and performed experimentally by Tomita and Chiao [38]. Afterwards, a large number of investigators treated this
geometric phase problem by making use of the classical Maxwell’s electrodynamics, diﬀerential geometry method

(parallel transport) and quantum adiabatic theory [23] both theoretically and experimentally [39–46]. Based on
the above investigations, we studied the nonadiabatic noncyclic geometric phases of photons propagating inside a
noncoplanarly curved optical ﬁber by using the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant theory and the invariant-related unitary
transformation formulation [47–49]. In the published paper [50], we considered the photon helicity inversion in the
curved ﬁber and its potential applications to information science and, on the basis of the second-quantized spin
model, we calculated the quantum-vacuum geometric phases of electromagnetic ﬁelds, which results from the vacuum
zero-point ﬂuctuation.

A. Nonadiabatic noncyclic geometric phases of photons in the noncoplanar optical ﬁber

In what follows we consider a potential vacuum eﬀect in a time-dependent quantum system, i.e., time evolution
of photon wave function and rotations of polarization planes in a noncoplanar ﬁber. The spin angular momentum
operators of photon ﬁelds read (in the natural units ¯h = c = 1)

Consider a noncoplanarly curved optical ﬁber that is wound smoothly on a large enough diameter [38], the eﬀective

along the tangent to the curved ﬁber at each point at arbitrary time. Readers may be referred to the Appendices to
this paper for the derivation of eﬀective Hamiltonian (3.3). According to the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant theory [47]
and the invariant-related unitary transformation formulation [48], the exact particular solution to the time-dependent

associated with the photonic occupation numbers nR and nL are quantal in character [48]. Gao has shown why
φ(g)(t) = (nR
is referred to as the quantal geometric phases [48] by taking into con-
1

sideration the uncertainty relation between the operators 1
aR(L)(k)]. Although
the phases φ(g)(t) in (3.14) are quantal geometric phases of photons, they do not belong to the geometric phases at
quantum-vacuum level which arise, however, from the zero-point electromagnetic energy of quantum vacuum ﬂuc-
tuation. Since the cyclic adiabatic cases of (3.14) have been measured experimentally by Tomita and Chiao et al.
[38–40,43], we will not consider them further. In the following we will study instead the geometric phases at quantum
vacuum level, which has not been tested experimentally yet. The reason for why it cannot be easily tested will be
given at the end of this section.

Investigation of quantum-vacuum geometric phases due to vacuum ﬂuctuation energies possesses theoretical signiﬁ-
cance: in conventional time-independent quantum ﬁeld theory the inﬁnite zero-point energy of vacuum is harmless and
can be easily removed by the normal-order procedure [55]. However, for the time-dependent quantum ﬁeld systems,
(e.g., photon ﬁelds propagating inside a helically curved ﬁber, and quantum ﬁelds in an expanding universe or time-
dependent gravitational backgrounds), the time-dependent vacuum zero-point ﬁelds may also participate in the time
evolution process and therefore cannot be regarded merely as an inactive onlooker (i.e., a simple passive background).
According to the formulation applied to the time-independent ﬁeld theory, these physically interesting vacuum eﬀects
would unfortunately have been deducted by the second-quantization normal-order technique. For this reason, we think
that perhaps it is necessary to consider the validity problem of normal-order procedure in time-dependent quantum
ﬁeld theory.

Since quantum-vacuum geometric phases has an important connection with vacuum quantum ﬂuctuation, its ex-

perimental realization deserves consideration, which will be brieﬂy discussed at the end of this section.

B. Wave propagation in biaxially anisotropic left-handed materials

It is well known that the geometric phases of photons inside a curved ﬁber in previous experiments [38] often depend
on the cone angles of solid angles subtended by a curve traced by the direction of wave vector of light at the center
of the photon momentum k space. Here, however, by taking into account the peculiar properties of wave propagation
in certain biaxially anisotropic left-handed media, we will present a physically interesting geometric phase that is
independent of the cone angles. First we consider the wave propagation in this type of left-handed materials with the
permittivity and permeability tensors as follows

If the propagation vector of time-harmonic electromagnetic wave is k = (0, 0, k), then according to the Maxwellian
µH1, µH2, 0). It follows from the Faraday’s
Equations, one can arrive at k
µµ0ω . Thus, the third component of Poynting

vector of this time-harmonic wave is obtained

respectively. It is apparently seen from (3.19) that the direction of wave vector S(2) is opposite to that of S(1). This,
therefore, means that if µ > 0, then for the E1 ﬁeld, this biaxially anisotropic medium characterized by (3.17) is like
a right-handed material (regular material) whereas for the E2 ﬁeld, it serves as a left-handed one.

In view of above discussions, it is concluded that inside the above biaxially anisotropic medium, the wave vectors
of E1- and E2- ﬁelds of propagating planar wave are apposite to each other. Consider a hypothetical optical ﬁber

7

that is made of this biaxially anisotropic left-handed medium, inside which the wave vector of E1 ﬁeld propagating is
assumed to be k(t) = k(sin λ cos γ, sin λ sin γ, cos λ). If both λ and γ are nonvanishing, then this ﬁber is noncoplanarly
curved and in consequence the geometric phases of light will arise. It is readily veriﬁed from (3.19) that the wave
λ and γ′ = γ + π. Note that for the latter
vector of E2- ﬁeld is

left-handed media.

which diﬀers from (3.14) only by a cone angle λ(t) of photon momentum k space.

Since the geometric phases of both left- and right- handed polarized light propagating in the above biaxially
anisotropic left-handed materials depend no longer on the cone angle, someone may argue that the geometric phases
presented here lose their topological and global nature. This is not the true case. Geometric phases presents the
topological properties of quantum systems in time-evolution process. Diﬀering from dynamical phase that depends on
dynamical quantities of systems such as energy, frequency, velocity as well as coupling coeﬃcients, geometric phase is
independent of these dynamical quantities. Instead, it is only related to the geometric nature of the pathway along
which quantum systems evolve. It follows that here φ(g)
tot(t) is related only to the precessional frequency ˙γ of photon
propagation in the curved ﬁber, which is not of dynamical nature and therefore cannot be considered the dynamical
quantity. This precessional frequency depends upon the geometric shape of curved ﬁber. For example, in the helically
curved ﬁber, which was used ﬁrst in Tomita and Chiao’s experiment to produce photon cyclic Berry’s phase [38], the
√d2+(4πa)2 [50], where d and a respectively denote the pitch length and the radius of
precessional frequency equals
tot(t) still possesses the geometric

the helix, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. For this reason, we think that φ(g)
nature of time evolution of photon wave function and can be regarded as the geometric phase.

D. Brief discussion: testing quantum-vacuum geometric phases

As is stated above, the photon geometric phases at quantum-vacuum level originates from the zero-point elec-
tromagnetic ﬂuctuations. Since geometric phases indicates topological and global properties of quantum systems in
time-evolution processes, the quantum-vacuum geometric phases of electromagnetic ﬁelds in the helically wound ﬁber
may contain the information on the global properties of time evolution of vacuum ﬂuctuation ﬁelds. Moreover, we
should make it clear whether the normal-order procedure is valid or not in the time-dependent quantum ﬁeld theory
and it is therefore essential to detect the quantum-vacuum geometric phases (3.16) in experiments.

σ=

However, it should be pointed out that, unfortunately, even at the quantum level, this observable quantum-vacuum
geometric phases φ(vac)
1(t) is absent in the ﬁber experiment, since it follows from (3.15) and (3.16) that the signs
±
of quantal geometric phases of left- and right-handed circularly polarized photons are just opposite to one another,
and so that the quantum-vacuum geometric phases would have been counteracted by each other. Hence the observed
geometric phases are only those expressed by (3.14), the adiabatic case of which, as stated above, has been measured
in the optical ﬁber experiments performed by Tomita and Chiao et al. [38–40,43]. It is impossible for physicists to
detect the quantum-vacuum geometric phases, which has been eliminated, in these ﬁber experiments.

Since the quantum-vacuum geometric phases is so important but unfortunately cancelled by each other (hence
the total vacuum geometric phases vanishes), we must ask such question: how can we detect the quantum-vacuum
geometric phases corresponding to only one of the circularly polarized light? The studies in the previous subsection
enlighten us on this subject. If one can design and fabricate a kind of such artiﬁcial composite metamaterials, where
for the left-handed polarized light the material serves as a left-handed medium, while for the right-handed polarized
light it behaves like an ordinary material, i.e., the right-handed medium, then in this medium the quantum-vacuum
geometric phases corresponding to the right- and left- handed polarized light are

of physically interest to take into account this topic, designing such materials is very complicated and is not the
main subject in this paper, so here we will not discuss further this problem. It is under consideration and will be
published elsewhere. Here we only emphasize that it is truly possible for us to detect quantum-vacuum geometric
phases by using certain anisotropic left-handed media. For instance, in section II, we stated that the indices squared
of left- and right- handed circularly polarized light in gyrotropic media are respectively n2

and n2
R = (ǫ1 + ǫ2)(µ1 + µ2), respectively [8]. If, for example, by taking some certain values of ǫ1, ǫ2, µ1 and µ2,
L < 0 while n2
then n2
R > 0 and consequently the left-handed polarized light cannot be propagated in this medium,
and in the meanwhile the quantum vacuum ﬂuctuation corresponding to the left-handed polarized light will also be
absorbed (e.g., the wave amplitude exponentially decreases because of the imaginary part of the refractive index) in
this anisotropic absorptive medium (i.e., the vacuum-ﬂuctuation electromagnetic ﬁeld alters its mode structures in
the absorptive medium). For this reason, the only retained geometric phases is that of right-handed polarized light,
which we can test experimentally.

IV. EXTRA PHASES OF LIGHT AT THE INTERFACES BETWEEN LEFT- AND RIGHT- HANDED
MEDIA

In this section, we consider the eﬀects of light appearing at the interfaces between left- and right- handed media. In
order to treat this problem conveniently, we study the wave propagation inside an optical ﬁber which is periodically
modulated by altering regular and negative media. Although it is doubtful whether such periodically modulated ﬁbers
could be designed and realized or not in experiments at the optical scale, it could be argued that the work presented
here can be considered only a speculative one. But the method and results obtained via the use of this optical ﬁber
system composed by such sequences of right- and left- handed materials can also be applied to the light propagation
at the interfaces between left- and right- handed media in arbitrary geometric shapes of optical materials. In this
periodical optical ﬁber, helicity inversion (or the transitions between helicity states) of photons may be easily caused
by the interaction of light ﬁeld with media near both sides of the interfaces between LRH materials. Since photon
helicity inversion at the interfaces mentioned above is a time-dependent process, this new geometric phase arises
during the light propagates through the interfaces (in the following we will call them the LRH interfaces) between
left- and right- handed media, where the anomalous refraction occurs when the incident lightwave travels to the LRH
interfaces. we think that, in the literature it gets less attention than it deserves. In what follows we calculate the
photon wavefunction and corresponding extra phases (including the geometric phases) in this physical process, and
emphasize that we should attach importance to this geometric phases when considering the wave propagation near
the LRH interfaces.

We now treat the helicity reversal problem of light wave adjacent to the interfaces of left- and right- handed media.
For convenience, let us consider a hypothetical optical ﬁber that is fabricated periodically from both left- and right-
n and n, respectively. Thus the wave vector of photon
handed (LRH) media with the optical refractive indices being

of the photon, the eigenvalue of helicity acquires a minus sign in left-handed sections. We assume that at t = 0
the light propagates in the right-handed section and the initial eigenvalue of photon helicity is σ. So, in the wave
propagation inside the LRH-periodical optical ﬁber, the helicity eigenvalue of h is then (

B. Photon geometric phases due to helicity inversions inside a periodical ﬁber made of Left-handed media

Here we investigate the time evolution of photon wavefunctions and extra phases due to photon helicity inversion at
the LRH interfaces. As has been stated above, for convenience, we consider the wave propagation inside a hypothetical
optical ﬁber which is composed periodically of left- and right- handed media. Now we solve the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation. In accordance with the Lewis-Riesenfeld theory, the invariant I(t) is a conserved operator (i.e.,
it possesses time-independent eigenvalues) and agrees with the following Liouville-Von Neumann equation

problem of I(t) is therefore easily resolved. According to our experience for utilizing the invariant-related unitary

Hence the particular exact solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (4.3) corresponding to the particular

It follows from the obtained expression (4.15) for geometric phase of photons that, if the frequency parameter ω

where 2π(1

phase is related only to the geometric nature of the pathway along which quantum systems evolve. Expression (4.17)
is analogous to the magnetic ﬂux produced by a monopole of strength σ existing at the origin of the parameter space.
This, therefore, implies that geometric phases diﬀer from dynamical phases and involve the global and topological
properties of the time evolution of quantum systems.

C. In biaxially anisotropic left-handed media

Note that in the previous subsection, we treat the helicity reversals of single photon in electromagnetic media made
of isotropic left- and right- handed materials. Now we consider this problem in a system composed by a sequence of
right-handed (isotropic) and biaxially anisotropic left-handed media, the permittivity and permeability of the latter is
given in (3.17). It has been veriﬁed in Sec.III that for the E1- ﬁeld this biaxially anisotropic medium can be regarded
as a right-handed material while for the E2- ﬁeld it can be considered a left-handed one. This, therefore, implies that
only the E2- ﬁeld propagating through this biaxially anisotropic left-handed medium will acquire an additional phase
due to its helicity inversion at the LRH interfaces. But since the E2- ﬁeld is not the eigenmode of the photon helicity,
we cannot obtain the extra phases immediately by using the formula (4.4). According to the treatment in Sec.III, one
can arrive at the expression for the total extra phases of circularly polarized light (with the occupation numbers of
polarized photons being nL and nR) propagating through the system made of a sequence of isotropic regular media
and biaxially anisotropic left-handed one, and the result is written as

Additionally, it is of interest to show that the above scheme is applicable to the detection of quantum-vacuum
geometric phases expressed by (3.15). Since the left-handed polarized light (including the quantum vacuum ﬂuctuation
corresponding to the left-handed polarized light) cannot be propagated in this media [2,8], the quantum-vacuum
geometric phase of right-handed polarized light will not be cancelled by that of left-handed one, namely, the only
retained quantum-vacuum geometric phase is that of right-handed circularly polarized light and therefore it is possible
for the nonvanishing quantum-vacuum geometric phases to be detected in experiments.

D. Discussion: physical signiﬁcance and potential applications

It is worthwhile to point out that the geometric phase of photons due to helicity inversion presented here is of
quantum level. However, whether the Chiao-Wu geometric phase due to the spatial geometric shape of ﬁber is of
quantum level or not is not apparent (see, for example, the arguments between Haldane and Chiao et al. about this
problem [44,45]), since the expression for the Chiao-Wu geometric phase can be derived by using both the classical
Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory, diﬀerential geometry and quantum mechanics [39,41,43–45]. However, the geometric
phase in this paper can be considered only by Berry’s adiabatic quantum theory and Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant theory,

13

namely, the classical electrodynamics cannot predict this geometric phase. Although many investigators have taken
into account the boundary condition problem and anomalous refraction in left-handed media by using the classical
Maxwell’s theory [3,8], less attention is paid to this geometric phase due to helicity inversion. It is believed that this
geometric phase originates at the quantum level, but survives the correspondence-principle limit into the classical
level. So, We emphasize that it may be essential to take into consideration this geometric phase in investigating the
anomalous refraction at the LRH interfaces.

It is well known that geometric phases arise only in time-dependent quantum systems. In the present problem, the
transitions between helicity states on the LRH interfaces, which is a time-dependent process, results in the geometric
phase of photons. This may be viewed from two aspects: (i) it is apparently seen in Eq.(4.8) that if the frequency
parameter ω in the Hamiltonian (4.1) vanishes, then ˙ϕ = 0 and the geometric phase (4.15) is therefore vanishing; (ii)
it follows from (4.2) that the frequency coeﬃcient ω (t) of Hamiltonian (4.1) is

we can conclude that the interaction of light ﬁelds with media near the LRH interfaces gives rise to this topological
quantum phase.

(cid:1)(cid:12)
(cid:12)

≤

In addition to obtaining the expression (4.15) for geometric phase, we obtain the wavefunction (4.16) of photons
in the LRH- optical ﬁber by solving the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (4.3) based on the Lewis-Riesenfeld
invariant theory [47] and the invariant-related unitary transformation formulation [48,49]. We believe that this would
enable us to consider the propagation of light ﬁelds inside the optical ﬁber in more detail.

In the above treatment, we constructed an eﬀective Hamiltonian (4.1) to describe the time evolution of helicity
states of photons.
It should be noted that the method presented here is only a phenomenological description of
propagation of lightwave in the LRH-periodical ﬁber. This phenomenological description is based on the assumption
that the direction of wave vector k becomes opposite nearly instantaneously on the LRH interfaces. This assumption
holds true so long as the periodical length b is much larger than the wavelength of lightwave in the ﬁber.

To close this section, we conclude with some remarks on the potential signiﬁcance of the subject in this section:
(i) The obtained geometric phase itself is physically interesting. Moreover, it is necessary to consider this geometric
phase in discussing the anomalous refraction and wave propagation in left-handed media (adjacent to the LRH
interfaces).

(ii) Helicity inversion of photons, which is in exact analogy with the transition operation between 0 and 1 in
digital circuit, can be caused due to the electromagnetic interactions at LRH interfaces, and the time evolution of
helicity states is governed by (4.16). It is of essential signiﬁcance to control and utilize the degrees of freedom of
photons (photon number, polarization, helicity, geometric phase, etc.) in information science and technology [57].
In the curved optical ﬁber, the interaction of the photon spin with the wave vector causes the helicity inversion of
the photon, some authors have considered its application to information theory [57,58]. Likewise, here we think the
instantaneous process of photon helicity reversals may also have some potential applications in information technology
and therefore deserve further investigation.

(iii) It is of physical interest to consider the quantum eﬀects such as propagation of photons ﬁeld, polarization of
photon states (time evolution of photon wavefunction) and spontaneous emission decay rate of atoms [2] in left-handed
media. In this section, an illustrative example of quantum eﬀects of photons ﬁeld resulting from helicity inversion
caused by the LRH interfaces is presented. We hope the present consideration in this paper would open up new
opportunities for investigating more quantum mechanical properties, phenomena and eﬀects in left-handed media.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We consider the bianisotropic structures in optical “constants” of left-handed media whereby the left-right coupling

of circularly polarized light and cone angle independent geometric phases arises.

inside a curved ﬁber in previous experiments often relate to the cone angles of solid angles subtended at the center.
Here, however, we present a new geometric phase that is independent of the cone angles, by taking into account the
peculiar properties of wave propagation in some anisotropic left-handed media. Some related topics (i.e., experimental
realizations of quantum vacuum geometric phases of photons by using certain anisotropic (e.g., gyrotropic) left-handed
materials, and photon geometric phases due to instantaneous helicity inversion on the interfaces between left- and
right- handed media) are also discussed.

Geometric phases of circularly polarized light has some possible applications to quantum computation [35,36], since
the wave propagation of coiled light is somewhat analogous to the behavior of nuclear magnetic resonance system
[36]. Realizing quantum computation by means of geometric origin of adiabatic cyclic Berry’s phase is now receiving
attention due to its intrinsic tolerance to noise. Recently, a conditional geometric phase shift gate, which is fault
tolerant to certain types of errors due to its geometric nature, was realized via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
under adiabatic conditions [59]. However, the adiabatic conditions makes any fast conditional Berry’s phase shift
impossible. So, more recently, Wang and Keiji suggested a scheme of nonadiabatic conditional geometric phase shift
with NMR [36], the mathematical treatment of which is just the same as (3.4)-(3.6), so long as both the cone angle
λ and the precessional frequency ˙γ (denoted by Ω) are taken to be constant.

To summarize, in this paper we focus on some interesting properties of wave propagation of polarized photons in
biaxially anisotropic left-handed materials, which has not been considered yet by the authors in the ﬁelds of classical
optics, condensed matter physics and materials science. Since it is possible for current technology to fabricate uniaxi-
ally and biaxially anisotropic left-handed media in experiments, we hope the optical eﬀects and phenomena discussed
above would be investigated experimentally in the near future.

Appendix I. Three derivations of eﬀective Hamiltonian of photons inside a noncoplanarly curved ﬁber

The eﬀective Hamiltonian describing the light wave propagation in a curved optical ﬁber is helpful in considering
the nonadiabatic noncyclic time evolution process of photon wavefunction in the ﬁber. We have three methods to
derive this eﬀective Hamiltonian (3.3).

Method i By using the inﬁnitesimal rotation operator of wavefunction

of as a “Lorentz magnetic force” or “Coriolis force”). Similar to the Mashhoon et al.’s work (i.e., the derivation of the

write the Hamiltonian describing the coupling of the photon “gravitomagnetic moment” (i.e., photon spin S) [27] to

Method iii By using the Liouville-Von Neumann equation
If a photon is moving inside a noncoplanarly curved optical ﬁber that is wound smoothly on a large enough diameter

S is therefore conserved [37] and
k ·
can thus be considered a Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant I(t) [47], which agrees with the Liouville-Von Neumann equation
S = iS, one can solve the Liouville-Von Neumann
(4.6). With the help of the spin operator commuting relations S
equation (4.6), namely, if the eﬀective Hamiltonian is written as H(t) = h
S, then according to the Liouville-Von

iS, and readily obtain the expression for the eﬀective

Appendix II. The invariant-related unitary transformation formulation

In this appendix we brieﬂy review the invariant-related unitary transformation formulation [48,49], which is impor-
tant in investigating the nonadiabatic evolution process of time-dependent quantum systems (in Sec.IV). It has been
shown in Lewis and Riesenfeld’s work [47] that the particular solution to the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation, the
of the invariant I(t)
Hamiltonian generators of which form a certain Lie algebra, is diﬀerent from the eigenstate
(which satisﬁes the Liouville-Von Neumann equation (4.6)) only by a time-dependent c-number factor exp[ 1

where the time-dependent phase is [47]

It follows that we can obtain the solution to the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation via solving the eigenstates

. But it is diﬃcult to solve the eigenvalue equation of invariant I(t)
λ, t

immediately, for the invariant is often the linear combination of certain Lie algebraic generators and, moreover,
the coeﬃcient factors in I(t) are time-dependent. If we can ﬁnd a unitary transformation V (t) that transforms the

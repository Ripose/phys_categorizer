(Dated: January 20, 2014)

Tailored time-dependent variations of the transverse proﬁle together with longitudinal phase shifts
of laser beams are studied. It is shown theoretically that a standing wave setup and real-time beam
forming techniques (e.g. by computer-addressed holograms) should make it possible to implement
smooth transport across and along the beams employed in optical trapping schemes. Novel modes
for the eﬃcient collection, transport, and concentration of trapped particles should thus become
realizable in optical trapping setups.

INTRODUCTION

Trapping of objects with light is possible in all trans-
parent media such as liquids, air and other gases, and
vacuum. Laser beam trapping has become an established
technique where the size of the trapped objects ranges
over many orders of magnitude from atoms to particles
of several hundred µm size [1]. There are two standard
conﬁgurations: ﬁrstly counter-propagating plane waves
form standing light ﬁeld patterns yielding multiple traps
arranged as crystals (i.e. periodic intensity patterns or
’light crystals’ [2]), and secondly, strongly focussed laser
beams form laser tweezers, whose foci serve as single trap-
ping centers [1]. Because of their great power concentra-
tion, laser tweezers can levitate and hold small beads of
many micrometers size. Smaller objects such as bacte-
ria, nano-particles, molecules and atoms can also be held
and moved by ’light crystals’. For several atomic species
magneto-optical [3] and all-optical cooling schemes [4]
have, moreover, allowed to create ultra-cold samples of
dilute gas, some of them at fraction of nanokelvin tem-
peratures in the Bose-Einstein-condensate state [5].

Although trapping (and cooling) particles with light
is now a well established and mature ﬁeld, moving such
trapped particles with the help of the trapping ﬁelds is
less reﬁned. The main purpose of this paper is the intro-
duction of a new approach to the collection, (coherent)
transport, and spatial concentration of particles.

In particular the spatial concentration of particles with
current schemes is not optimized:
in the case of plane
wave generated light crystals the crystal cells cannot be
merged, laser tweezers suﬀer from small focal volumes,
and optical washboard potentials [6] do not transport co-

herently. So far, spatial concentration towards one point
is only achieved by changes to an auxiliary potential such
as that of an assisting magnetic ﬁeld [7]. Here, it is
shown that modulation of the beam characteristic of a
laser tweezer itself can open up new modes of coherent
transport, capture, concentration, excitation, and release
of particles.

For trapped atomic clouds this can help to increase
their phase space density since they can be simulta-
neously cooled and spatially concentrated [4]. Like-
larger particles suspended in viscous media can
wise,
be concentrated in phase space.
In the case of cold
atomic clouds it might help to continuously replenish
lossy traps [8] thus leading to continuous, Bose-Einstein-
condensation–mediated, atom-laser operation [9, 10]. In
the case of ions, fermions and other mutually repulsive
particles their collection and spatial concentration might
make it easier to reach unit-ﬁlling factors for the particle
population trapped in an optical lattice [11]; useful, e.g.,
for grid-based quantum computing [12].

This paper will ﬁrst review current setups and outline
my approach in section II and the terminology for the de-
scription of paraxial beams in section III. Section IV and
its subsections will deal with one- and two-dimensional
modiﬁcations of the transverse mode proﬁle of paraxial
beams over time. This will demonstrate that manipulat-
ing the mode structure of a laser beam enables us to tai-
lor its structure in such a way that controlled transport
of trapped particles across the beam becomes possible
and that this can be designed such that the particles are
moved into a smaller volume by merging the cells of the
eﬀective light lattice that traps the particles. For fur-
ther concentration an optical conveyor belt is introduced
allowing us to concentrate particles towards a ’point’ in
space and unload them there. After that, coherence pre-
serving transport is considered. Next, these ideas are
generalized for the case of low-ﬁeld seeking trap particles
in section V followed by the conclusion.

MODIFICATIONS

For focussed beams several scenarios have been imple-
mented:
longitudinally moving the trapping center by
refocussing together with redirection of the beam axis
allows for three-dimensional movement of the focus [8].
But the focal volume is quite small and has to be moved
in order to eﬃciently pick up more particles. There-
fore multi-beam approaches in which many independent
Gaussian foci are created have been demonstrated by
holographical beam splitting [13, 14], including their in-
dependent movement [13, 15], merger [16], and applica-
tion for size-selective particle deﬂection [17]. Yet, these
methods [13–16] do not continuously collect over the en-
tire beam volume but rather ’pointwise’ at the various
foci.

[18, 19],

In focussed beams also the transverse beam proﬁles
have been changed to generate annular high-order TEM-
’optical bot-
modes yielding ’optical tubes’
tles’ [20] and beam centers surrounded by washboard po-
tentials [6]. Moreover, beams have been equipped with
orbital angular momentum thus allowing trapped parti-
cles to be turned [21] and, also, to use this freedom for
quantum information coding [22]. Finally, tilted reﬂect-
ing light sheets together with gravity have been used to
implement atomic billiards [23].

For counter-propagating plane waves

(wide laser
beams) light crystals with diﬀerent symmetries are real-
izable. Depending on the number and relative orien-
tation of the employed beams, they form, e.g., cubic,
tetrahedral, and super-lattices [24] in three dimensions.
Eﬀectively two-dimensional sheets formed by evanescent
waves [25] and arrays of one-dimensional tubes [26] have
also been implemented. Such crystals can be moved by
detuning the frequency [27] or otherwise shifting the rel-
ative phase between beams, their lattice constants can
be varied to some extent by changing the relative angles
between interfering beams [2], but their unit cells cannot
be merged. I therefore want to explore other avenues for
the transport and concentration of trapped particles.

Currently established setups are quite static in the
sense that the underlying optical beam shapes are kept
unaltered [28]. The following changes to the beam struc-
ture could be considered though: one could change the
longitudinal properties of the beam, but for beams prop-
agating freely in homogenous media this is typically done
by changes to their spectral composition, for instance by
frequency-sweeping [27] or pulsing the beam [29]. Here,
only gradual and slow changes which, in the case of quan-
tum particles, will also allow us to preserve the trapped
objects’ coherence [30, 31] are considered. Also, the
polarization state of the trapping light ﬁelds could be
changed over time, this will be further investigated in
future work. Instead, the present paper concentrates on
slow temporal variations to the beam’s transverse ﬁeld
and intensity proﬁles for uniformly focussed polarized
light beams [32].

FIG. 1: Sketch of possible technical implementation (not to
scale): a setup using laser, ﬁve lenses and aperture A, a
semi-transparent balanced mirror T M to split the beam and
three mirrors M to recombine the two parts into one counter-
propagating standing wave beam. A computer-controlled
diﬀractive optical element DOE generates the modulation of
the trapping beam (which is shown as a solid hyperboloid).
A phase-shifter Φ allows for computer-controlled longitudinal
shift of the beam.

The ﬁeld of diﬀractive optics is a mature ﬁeld routinely
using computer-generated holograms to alter light ﬁelds.
Liquid crystal arrays and other spatial light modulators,
have been developed for video-beamer technology but are
now also used to implement diﬀractive optical elements
with computer-generated holograms in real time [1, 13–
16, 33, 34]. Typically, the diﬀractive element is posi-
tioned in a region where the laser beam is wide and its
wave fronts parallel, see Figure 1. It imprints its ampli-
tude information on the wide parallel beam the width of
which then is suitably shrunk (using lenses L2 and L3 in
Figure 1). Finally the beam is collimated using another
another set of lenses (L4 and L5 in Figure 1). Since
the focus of the collimated beam is –up to rescaling and
redirection– the Fourier-transform of the diﬀractive el-
ement’s amplitude pattern, we can easily calculate the
required input with a computer that controls the diﬀrac-
tive optical element in real time.

Resolution of the diﬀractive optical elements are not a
problem since mega-pixel LCD-screens are commercially
available. Also the deviations of the diﬀractive element’s
input from the ideal pattern due to its pixelated structure
is not a problem. The regular pixelation gives rise to
diﬀraction oﬀ axis which can be ﬁltered out using an
aperture A serving as an eﬀective low-pass ﬁlter [34].

If the phase shift Φ(t) is implemented by shifting the
frequency of one of the counter-propagating beams with
respect to the other, very large phase diﬀerences can be
accumulated very quickly. The same is currently not yet
true for modiﬁcations of I(x, y, z; t), beam formers were
developed for video technology and only allow to modify
the transverse intensity proﬁle at video frame rates, i.e.
on the order of some hundred Hertz [1, 13–16, 33, 34].
Fortunately, this is not a fundamental limit and it should
be easily overcome in the near future [28].

III. HERMITE-GAUSSIAN BEAMS:
TEM-MODES

In practical applications laser beams which are not too
tightly focussed are very important. Although the ideas
presented here are in principle applicable in more gen-
for very tightly focussed beams or very
eral cases, e.g.
general ﬁelds created by intensity masks or holograms,
we will only consider quasi-monochromatic beams in the
paraxial scalar approximation [35, 36]. In this approxi-
mation the solutions are the familiar transverse electro-
magnetic or TEMmn modes describing x-polarized beams
propagating in the z-direction with a vector potential
A = (Ax, Ay, Az) whose only non-zero component is Ax

The dispersion-relation of light in a homogenous medium
ω = ck was used; x, y are the transverse and z the lon-

pλb/π is the relation that links the minimal beam dia-
meter w0 with the Rayleigh range b. The beam dia-
meter at distance z from the beam waist (z = 0) obeys
w(z) = pw2
0(1 + z2/b2) and for large z shows the ex-
pected amplitude decay of a free wave
, the

beam’s opening angle in the far-ﬁeld is arctan(λ/(πw0)).
The corresponding wave front curvature is described by
R(z) = (z2 + b2)/z, and the longitudinal phase shift
(Gouy-phase) follows φ(z) = arctan(z/b); according to
the Gouy-phase factor e−i(m+n+1)φ(z) it leads to relative
dephasing between diﬀerent modes.

The vector potential Ax of Equation (3.1) describing a
beam travelling in the positive z-direction (k = kˆz) yields
an electric ﬁeld which is polarized in the x-direction with
a small contribution in the z-direction due to the tilt
of wave fronts oﬀ the beam axis (ˆx, ˆy, ˆz are the unit-
vectors). We omit this wavefront tilt and hence only
deal with the scalar approximation

Just like the paraxial approximation, the scalar approxi-

Since the wave equation is linear and the harmonic
oscillator wave functions form a complete orthonormal
set for the transverse coordinates x and y, we are free to

The coeﬃcients cmn(t) can be complex (i.e. change am-

have trapping in mind let us also assume that we dis-
cuss standing wave ﬁelds formed from a superposition
of (otherwise identical) counter-propagating beams, see
Figure 1 above. In this case we have

only contains terms with a controllable (slow) time-
dependence, namely cmn(t) and Φ(t) (see remarks at end

of the trapping beam which then travel across the beam
converging at one point [at (x, y) = (2, 2)] on the oppo-
site edge thus concentrating all captured particles into a
perl string, on the beam’s fringe, such as that depicted

tration process portrayed above.

Figure 5 shows the intensity corresponding to the ﬁeld
conﬁguration displayed in Figure 2 reconstructed using
the expansion coeﬃcients of Figure 3. In this case ex-
pansion up to twelfth order gives satisfactory results.
This allows us to create tailored two-dimensional poten-
tial landscapes that can be changed over time. In partic-
ular particle concentration, tunnelling or classical escape
scenarios could be implemented in this way [38, 39].

compare Figures 3 and 4.

Once the ﬁeld is speciﬁed in this way at one beam
plane this constitutes initial conditions which determine
the shape along the rest of the beam. The analysis of the
resulting overall beam behaviour and its possible appli-
cations are our next topics.

B. 3-D Concentration ‘in a Point’

Let us ﬁrst consider some motivation for the following
considerations:
let us assume that we try to optically
manipulate particles, we want to coherently transport,
concentrate and, ﬁnally, release particles. For the particle
release into a small volume we want to assume that there
is some kind of background-trap into which we want to
unload particles. We imagine that we have captured,
concentrated, and transported them using a ’foreground’-
trap which relies on the methods described above.

The background-trap’s ﬁeld must be suﬃciently strong
to hold particles but weak compared with the foreground
ﬁeld. Such a background-trap could be a single laser
tweezer focus, a magnetic trap, or it could form a light
crystal. We will see that even in the case of light crystals,
with their rather uniform trapping power it is possible for
the foreground beam to dominate the particles’ behavior
throughout the transport and yet release the particles
into a small area. This is achieved by an optical conveyor
belt with a well deﬁned end.

In section IV A we have just studied the transverse
variation of the trapping beam structure which allows
us to capture particles throughout the beam volume and
within every transverse slice concentrate particles at the
beam edge. Next, we assume that this concentration pro-
cesses ceases and instead, we keep the particles we have
concentrated ﬁxed at the beam edge. Now, by chang-
ing the relative phase between the two beams that form
the standing wave pattern (3.5), we can shift the entire
structure. Let us concentrate on the side which moves to-
wards the focus. Clearly, the foreground-trap’s strength

increases near the focus. This is illustrated by the in-
crease in focal intensity displayed in Figure 6, and noth-
ing much is won: if the foreground-trap manages to dom-
inate the background-trap elsewhere, it will typically in-
crease its dominance near the focus.

But, in the case of an intensity distribution which, un-
like that of Figure 6, is asymmetric with respect to the
beam axis, we expect according to ray-optics that the in-
tensity is mapped through the beam focus; this intensity
mapping can be exploited.

C. Gouy’s phase ﬂips the intensity at the focus:
the optical conveyor belt

For illustration consider the eﬀectively one-dimen-
sional superposition (ϕ4(√2x/w(z)) + iϕ5(√2x/w(z)))
·
ϕ0(√2y/w(z)). Its focal, standing-wave, intensity proﬁle
in the (x, z)-plane I(x, 0, z) is shown in Fig. 7 and we see
that the intensity pattern ﬂips over when the beam passes
the focal area. It does not uniformly weaken on one side
for the light intensity to smoothly move over to the other
side, instead, there is an interesting interference scenario
at the focus by which the intensity ridge is eﬀectively ter-
minated on the beam edge and separated by interference
nodes from the section across the beam where the same
edge is ’resurrected’ on the other side [32].

If we now assume that the relative phase Φ(t) in of
the standing waves (3.5) is varied, we immediately see,
that this can constitute a perl string of traps which is
moved towards the focus where it suddenly weakens.
At the point where the background trap is as strong
as this diminishing perl string,
it starts to take over
from the foreground-trap, this combination thus forms
an optical conveyor belt with a well deﬁned exit point
where the foreground beam’s cargo is handed over to the
background-trap.

tively two-dimensional) array of laser traps formed by evanes-
cent waves.

Fig. 8 sketches this scenario for the case of an
evanescent-wave light crystal that acts as a stationary
background-trapping ﬁeld fed from above by the funnel-
shaped foreground ﬁeld.

D. Coherence-preserving Transport

Many examples of coherence-preserving transport of
quantum particles [8, 31], their tunnelling [27, 38] and
classical escape dynamics [17] have already been observed
for optically trapped particles. With the greater vari-
ety of trapping potentials becoming available through the
methods sketched here, it will be possible to implement
new tailored potential and thus study such systems fur-
ther.

Note, that tunnelling and classical escape processes de-

pend extremely sensitively (exponentially) on the poten-
tial barrier size (Gamov-eﬀect) [39]. In this context it is
worth mentioning that we can change the intensity ratio
between foreground and background-trap ﬁeld thereby
modifying the barrier between them to make use of this
exponential sensitivity. This allows us to ﬁne-tune the
transfer process from one to the other.

V. LOW-FIELD SEEKERS

The discussion in section IV B only applies to high-ﬁeld
seeking particles, but for some tasks we will want to trap
low-ﬁeld seekers [18, 20]. Our above discussion can be
extended to serve the case of low-ﬁeld seeking particles
as well, using an altered ﬁeld conﬁguration providing us
with an optical ’bubble’ or ’foam’ beam.

As a ﬁrst step, the intensity proﬁle discussed in sec-
tion IV A would have to be surrounded by a light rim
sealing oﬀ the beam edge and a modiﬁcation of the beam
such that it contains suitable dark areas which can house
low-ﬁeld seeking particles, see Fig 9. The beam would re-
main leaky though, since particles could escape through
the nodes of the beams longitudinal standing wave pat-
tern. In order to plug this escape route one can create
a second standing wave beam acting as a stop-gap that
is uniformly bright in the transverse plane and aligned
with the rest of the trapping beam, but longitudinally
shifted by a quarter wavelength. In order to avoid pos-
sible destructive interference between these two parts of
the trapping beam they should be orthogonally polarized
leading to a simple adding up of their respective intensi-
ties, see Fig 10. This way we can create a beam with dark
inclusions surrounded by bright areas – a ’light-foam’ or
’bubble’ beam.

FIG. 9: Sketch of a possible ﬁeld conﬁguration for low ﬁeld
seeking particles: the ﬁeld surrounds areas of low intensity
with high intensity regions thus trapping particles in light
bubbles (and concentrating them towards the area around
(x, y) = (2, 2)).

FIG. 10: Sketch, along the beam axis z, of the conﬁguration
of the transversely modulated ﬁeld (red dotted line) in con-
o
junction with a 90

of equal strength (black line) that puts an intensity plug at
the nodes of the former. According to sin2 + cos2 = 1 two
waves of equal intensity can securely encase trapped low-ﬁeld
seeking particles.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

It was shown how to implement arbitrary transverse
ﬁelds with arbitrary time-dependence, useful for trap-
ping, coherent manipulation, concentration and release
of particles. In particular a scheme for an optical con-
veyor belt with an end (in the focal region) is introduced.
Use of another interlacing trap with orthogonal polariza-
tion was introduced in order to explain how the ideas
discussed here can be generalized to low-ﬁeld seeking
trapped particles.

[37] Note, that we cannot implement every desired ﬁeld pat-
tern since the employed monochromatic light only pro-
vides resolution down to the Rayleigh-limit. So, the de-
sired ﬁeld pattern has to be suﬃciently smooth to be
compatible with the wavelength of the used light. Very
high orders in the expansions of Ax in Equations (3.4)
and (3.5) cannot be used, they are incompatible with the
paraxiality assumption and therefore do not allow us to
go beyond the Rayleigh-limit.

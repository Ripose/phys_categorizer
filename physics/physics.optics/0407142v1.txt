The resonant behaviour of the Faraday rotation in a medium with
linear birefringence

It is shown that the monochromatic optical wave propagating through

the medium with linear birefringence in presence of a signal electromagnetic

wave (whose wavelength is equal to the polarization beats length), displays

Faraday rotation having the frequency of the signal wave and unsuppressed

by linear birefringence. The eﬀect is resonant with respect to the frequency

of a signal wave. The ”sharpness” of the resonance is deﬁned by length of the

birefringent medium.

I. INTRODUCTION

In the present paper we suggest the eﬀect of resonant behaviour of the Faraday rotation
of light propagating through a medium with linear birefringence. Due to the universality
of the eﬀect suggested the resonant frequency of the magnetic ﬁeld has nothing to do with
resonances of the susceptibility of the medium and completely deﬁned by the value of linear
birefringence of the medium in the transparency spectral region. In this section we describe
the essence of the eﬀect. For this reason we brieﬂy remind some statements of the polar-
ization optics. The optical wave electrical displacement vector in the medium runs over the
ellipse whose plane is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. The parameters
of this ellipse deﬁne the wave polarization. The case of ellipse squeezed to a line corresponds
to linear polarization, the case of circle corresponds to circular polarization. The relative
amplitudes and phases of the projections of this motion with respect to some ﬁxed coordi-
nate system completely deﬁne the polarization state. These projections can be described by
Jones vector:

|ξ >=

cos φ exp iδ
sin φ

 

!

(1)

where cos φ and sin φ – relative amplitudes, and δ – relative phase of the projections. For
an arbitrary direction in anisotropic medium one can specify two linearly independent
monochromatic waves – normal modes – propagating with no change of the polarization
state. The normal modes Jones vectors |ξ± > are the eigen vectors of the inverse per-
mittivity tensor projected on the plane perpendicular to the wave propagation direction.

1

The corresponding eigen values deﬁne the normal modes refractive indexes n± [1]. Be-
low we consider the transparent anisotropic medium for which the matrix of this tensor is
hermitian with its real symmetric part describing linear birefringence and imaginary anti-
symmetric part describing circular birefringence. For the problems of polarization optics not
the refractive indexes of the normal modes themselves are of prime importance but their
diﬀerence. Omitting some detailes which are not important for us we can introduce tensor
ˆη whose eigen values reproduce the deviations of refractive indexes of normal modes from
their main (or average) value (which we denote by n) and whose eigen vectors reproduce the
Jones vectors of the normal modes. Real symmetric part of this tensor describe the linear
birefringence and imaginary antisymmetric part describe the circular birefringence. In the
coordinate system where the real part of this tensor is diagonal it can be always written in
the following convenient form:

(2)

(3)

(4)

2ˆη ≡ h0ˆσz + h1ˆσy

where ˆσz and ˆσy – Pauli spin-matrices:

ˆσz ≡

1
2  

1
0
0 −1 !

,

ˆσy ≡

1
2  

0 −i
i

0 !

In accordance with the above we call coeﬃcient h0 linear birefringence and coeﬃcient h1
we call gyration. The arbitrary polarized incident light can be always reproduced as a
linear combination of the normal modes. Due to the fact that the propagation velocities of
the normal modes diﬀer from each other the polarization state will display the periodical
changes along the propagation direction. The corresponding spatial period Λbeats called the
polarization beats length and can be calculated as:

Λbeats =

Λ
|n− − n+|

,

Here Λ – is the vacuum wavelength of the incident light. For the case of the media with
linear birefringence the normal modes are linearly polarized in two orthogonal directions and
the polarization beats represent the periodical changes of ellipticity. For the case of circular
birefringence (which appear for example in the isotropic medium aﬀected by the magnetic
ﬁeld) the normal modes are the circularly polarized waves with diﬀerent direction of rotation.
In this case (if the incident wave is linearly polarized) the polarization beats represent the
rotation of the polarization plane. Below we consider h0, h1 << n ≡ (n+ + n−)/2, which
is almost always the case for the actual media. Now we are ready to pass to our eﬀect.
Suppose that the linearly polarized wave falls on the medium having length L with linear
birefringence h0. Suppose that this wave has one of eigen polarizations of the medium. This
wave will pass through the medium with no change of polarization state. Now let us switch

2

on the weak longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld which gives rise to gyration h1 << h0. If the linear
birefringence is zero, the polarization plane would rotate by an angle πLh1/Λ. Nevertheless
it is known that if h1 << h0 (weak gyration) and L >> Λbeats = 2Λ/h0 (the medium
length is greater than polarization beats spatial period) the above rotation is considerably
suppressed [2]. This suppression can be removed as follows [2,3]. Suppose that the magnetic
ﬁeld is periodically varying in space and has the spatial period 2Λ/h0 i.e. equal to that
of polarization beats. For example let gyration be the following function of coordinate:
∼ h1 cos(πh0x/Λ). Then (under some additional conditions [3]) the polarization plane of
the beam on exit of the medium rotate by an angle πLh1/Λ, equal to that for the case
of zero linear birefringence. It is wellknown eﬀect of compensation of linear birefringence
[2,3]. In this paper we suggest the eﬀect of similar compensation by means of magnetic ﬁeld
which is constant in space (along the beam propagation direction) but varying in time. Let
us introduce the incident plane wave as a sequence of pulses, each of which contain several
spatial periods of the incident wave Λ. One of these pulses is depicted on Fig.1 by a bold
line. The temporal dependence of coordinate x(t) of an arbitrary pulse has the form:

x(t) = x0 +

c
n

t

Here x0 – is the pulse coordinate at t = 0, n – the main value of refractive index of the
medium, c – the speed of light. Pulse can be identiﬁed by the value of x0 and for this reason
we denote the pulse whose coordinate is x0 at t = 0 by a term ”pulse x0”. Now let us aﬀect
our medium by a time-dependent magnetic ﬁeld directed along the x- axis. If we denote by
ω the frequency of this magnetic ﬁeld, then this ﬁeld gives rise to a gyration which can be
written in the form:

It is easy to see that from the point of view of the pulse x0 the gyration depends on x.

For this to see one should express t from (5) and substitute it in (6):

By changing the frequency of magnetic ﬁeld ω one can adjust the spatial period of
gyration (7) to be equal to that of polarization beats related to the linear birefringence of
the medium. This leads to the following relationship for this frequency:

Here λ is the vacuum wavelength of the electromagnetic wave having the frequency ω. So we
see that the linear birefringence is compensated for the pulse x0 and this pulse (under some
additional conditions which we consider below) will display unsuppressed Faraday rotation
πLh1/Λ. This eﬀect is resonant with respect to the deviation of frequency of the magnetic
ﬁeld from the value deﬁned by (8). In the next section we present the quantitative calculation
and show that the above resonance is accompanied by oscillations of the polarization plane
with frequency ω.

II. CALCULATION

In this section we present a calculation of the above eﬀect. It is convenient to perform
calculations by means of the quasispin method - the method of polarization optics based
on the formal similarity of the dynamics of quantum two-level system and the dynamics
of polarization of light propagating in the anisotropic medium. Let us remind brieﬂy the
essence of this method. The polarization state is described by the vector of quasispin S whose
components Si expressed via the Pauli spin matrices ˆσi and Jones vector (1) as follows:

Si ≡< ξ| ˆσi|ξ >

i = 1, 2, 3

While propagating through the medium the polarization of the beam can change and
consequently the direction of quasispin S depends on x-coordinate along the propagation
direction. This dependence can be described by the Bloch equation:

(9)

(10)

dS/dD = [H, S]

The dimensionless coordinate D plays the role of ”time” and can be expressed in terms
of conventional coordinate x as: D ≡ 2πx/Λ. The eﬀective ”magnetic ﬁeld” vector can
be expressed via the linear birefringence and gyration as follows: H ≡ (0, h1, h0). The
quantities h1 and h0 can depend on D. Below we deal with the gyration having the sinusoidal
dependence on D. This dependence can be removed by passing to the rotating frame in the
Bloch equation (10) [3]. Let us now turn to the problem we are interested in.

Consider the monochromatic beam having the vacuum wavelength Λ propagating in a
medium with linear birefringence h0 and with average refractive index n (Fig.1) We are
interested in the dynamics of the polarization of this wave and we call this wave the optical
wave. Let the other monochromatic wave (which will be hereinafter referred to as signal
wave) be falling at the medium at an angle β so the vector of the magnetic ﬁeld in this
wave has the x- component ∼ cos β. The magnetic ﬁeld of the signal wave give rise to the
gyration in the medium and the polarization of optical wave acquire the increment which we
are interested in. Let λ be the vacuum wavelength of the signal wave, n1 be the refractive

4

(11)

(12)

index of the enviroment, L be the medium length. Let the thickness of the medium be much
smaller than λ so the magnetic ﬁeld of the signal wave is homogeneous within our medium.
The setup described corresponds to the case of the planar waveguide with the optical wave
propagating inside it and irradiated by the signal wave falling at an angle β to the plane of
the waveguide. It is easy to see that the distribution of gyration in the medium, produced
by a signal wave, can be written as:

h = h1 cos

ωt − x

n1 sin β

(cid:20)

(cid:21)

h1 ≡ 2H0V cos β

2π
λ

where V – the Verdet constant of the medium, H0 – the amplitude of the magnetic ﬁeld
in the signal wave, ω – the frequency of ﬁeld oscillations in it. Now let us consider this
distribution from the point of view of the pulse x0 of the optical wave – in the same way it
was done in the Introduction. For this reason express t from (5) and substitute it in (11).
Passing to the dimensionless coordinate one can obtain that from the pulse x0 point of view
the following spatial distribution of the gyration take place:

h(D) = h1 cos

Ω ≡

x0

If we denote the optical wave quasispin vector on the entrance of the medium by S0,
then the temporal behaviour of the quasispin of the pulse x0 can be calculated from the
Bloch equation (10) with the eﬀective ”magnetic ﬁeld” H = (0, h, h0) and under the initial
condition S(0) = S0. The equation (10) should be solved within the interval D ∈ [0, 2πL/Λ].
The solution of this problem can be carried out in a conventional way and consists of the
following steps:

1. Replace the eﬀective ”magnetic ﬁeld” oscillating in y-direction by the ﬁeld rotating

in xy plane and having the same y-component.

2. Pass to the frame rotating with ”frequency” Ω. We denote the matrix of corresponding
coordinate transformation by ˆR. The eﬀective ”magnetic ﬁeld” in the rotating R -frame has
the form:

3. Perform the rotation around the x-axis of the R -frame by an angle:

We denote the matrix of this transformation by ˆT . In this T R -frame the eﬀective ”magnetic
ﬁeld” has the components:

˜H = (0, h0 − Ω, h1).

θ = arctan

h0 − Ω

.

˜˜H = (0, 0, ˜Ω),

where

The solution of Bloch equation in T R -frame represent the rotation around z-axis with
”frequency” ˜Ω. The corresponding matrix has the form:

i.e., if ˜˜S0 = ˆT ˆR S0 is the quasispin of light at D = 0 in T R -frame, then for the arbitrary
D, quasispin in T R -frame ˜˜S(D) can be written as: ˜˜S(D) = ˆE ˜˜S0. To obtain the ﬁnal result
one should pass back to the initial frame. Consequently, the quasispin dynamics can be
calculated as:

S(D) = ˆR−1 ˆT −1 ˆE ˆT ˆRS0

The explicit expressions for the above matrices are:

cos(φ0 − ΩD) − sin(φ0 − ΩD)
cos(φ0 − ΩD)

To calculate the quasispin on the exit of the medium one should set: D = 2πL/Λ.
Remind now that we make our calculations for the polarization of the pulse x0. This pulse
goes out of the medium at t = n(L − x0)/c. Taking into account the expression (12) we
obtain that for calculation of the temporal dynamics of the quasispin on the exit of the
medium one should set

in formula (13). Let us consider the simple example with the incident optical wave having
the eigen polarization of linear birefringent medium. In this case the initial quasispin on the
entrance of the medium is directed along z-axis for an arbitrary pulse of the optical wave:

For this initial condition let us perform all the matrix multiplications in (13) except the

last one ( ˆR−1). For the quasispin on the exit of the medium we obtain:

Note that S1 has no temporal dependence. It is seen that the temporal behaviour of S(D)
represent the rotation of vector S1 around z-axis with frequency ω of the signal wave.

When h0 = Ω, θ = 0 the polarization state of optical wave displays maximum change:
the quasispin vector runs over the cone with an angle h1D = 2πh1L/Λ what corresponds to
the twice smaller oscillations of the polarization plane πh1L/Λ, i.e. to the Faraday rotation
of the optical wave unsuppressed by the linear birefringence. The direct calculation shows
that the amplitude φ of the Faraday rotation of the optical wave is:

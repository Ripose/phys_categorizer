We study the propagation of electromagnetic pulses through photonic bandgap materials and
relate time-domain pulse reshaping to observable transit times. For layered dielectric mirrors we
demonstrate how pulse reshaping of slowly varying classical ﬁelds results in transit-time delays
that are equivalent to the group delay. The time-domain analysis emphasizes the causal origin of
negative group delays. We also study an analogous fully-quantized model and show how the same
time-domain analysis may be used to interpret observed delays of single-photon ﬁelds.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The propagation speed of particles through tunneling
regions has been studied theoretically since the early days
of quantum mechanics, and optical analogs of tunneling
have been explored in recent years because of their ex-
perimental accessibility. The physical meaning of group
velocities greater than the vacuum speed of light c has
been investigated in experimental work on the propaga-
tion of photons through layered dielectric materials with
photonic bandgaps at the frequency of the light [1, 2, 3].
The measured delays of individual photons in these ex-
periments were consistent with the group delay calcu-
lated as the derivative of the phase of the transmission
amplitude with respect to angular frequency. The group
delay can be negative, seemingly consistent with propa-
gation at a speed greater than c. As has been pointed out
previously these anomalous delays are the result of pulse
reshaping and they do not imply a violation of Einstein
causality [1, 2, 3]. (Similar anomalous sound speeds due
to pulse reshaping in one-dimensional acoustic bandgaps
have also been investigated experimentally [4].) In this
paper we take advantage of the regularity of layered di-
electric mirrors to explore explicit eﬀects of pulse reshap-
ing in the time domain, and use this framework to inter-
pret the origin of the observed pulse delays. We study re-
shaping of both classical ﬁeld pulses and fully-quantized
single-photon “pulses.” We make a quantitative connec-
tion between the time-domain reshaping and the conven-
tional group delay that yields insight into the origin of
observed negative delays.

We consider propagation through mirrors comprised of
layers of non-dispersive linear dielectric materials, each
of which can be characterized by a single real index of re-

fraction ni. This means that within a single material elec-
tromagnetic waves propagate with equal phase and group
velocities given by c/ni. The reduced speeds within such
materials are partially responsible for observed pulse de-
lays, but the reshaping due to multiple reﬂections also
plays a signiﬁcant role. Analogous anomalous sound
speeds due to pulse reshaping in one-dimensional acous-
tic bandgaps have also been investigated experimentally
[4].

We study propagation of plane waves which are nor-
mally incident on layered dielectrics; the thickness of a
layer is given by di and the index by ni. To keep things
simple we limit the analysis to materials in which the op-
tical path length is the same for all layers, which means
that the time it takes light to cross a layer is the same for
all layers. For convenience we deﬁne a time δA which is
the round trip time within a layer, i.e., twice the transit
time,

δA =

2dini
c

,

(1)

(2)

which is independent of the index i. We also deﬁne a
time δB which corresponds to the delay of a wavefront
propagating through the entire mirror:

δB =

1

di(ni −

In Sec.II we examine the propagation of classical ﬁelds
and delineate the dependence of the observed delays on
the two parameters δA and δB.
In Sec. III we extend
the analysis to fully-quantized single photon ﬁelds, and
draw parallels between the propagation of classical and
quantum ﬁelds.

Pulse reshaping in layered dielectrics is most dramatic
for pulses with abrupt changes in amplitude, and we ﬁrst

consider the eﬀects on square pulses. Although the re-
shaping of such pulses leads to signiﬁcant distortion, the
simplicity of square pulses makes it easy to disentangle
the eﬀects leading to transit-time delays. After demon-
strating the nature of the reshaping eﬀects with square
pulses we discuss slowly varying pulses, and derive quan-
titative expressions for delays.

A. Reshaping of Square Pulses

E

We consider a classical square pulse with complex mag-
nitude
and duration τ , and assume that in the absence
of any dielectric material this pulse arrives at the obser-
vation point at t = 0, so that the observed complex ﬁeld
amplitude after propagating through a vacuum can be
written

For pulses with durations τ that are large compared
to the round-trip time δA, many terms in Eq. (4) have
time to “turn on” before the pulse completely passes by
the observation point. In the middle of such pulses the
eﬀective total transmission coeﬃcient is

When the ﬁeld passes through a layered dielectric slab
the ﬁeld arriving at the observation point is composed
of multiple reﬂections. The leading edge of the trans-
mitted ﬁeld undergoes no reﬂections, and is delayed by
the time δB; reﬂected fractions of the ﬁeld will be addi-
tionally delayed by multiples of δA. We write the total
ﬁeld arriving at the observation point as the sum of terms
grouped according the how much time the ﬁeld has spent
traversing the mirror. The ﬁrst term corresponds to light
that suﬀers no reﬂections; the second to light that spends
an “extra” time δA within the mirror; the third to light
that spends an “extra” time 2δA within the mirror, etc.
(The terms are not grouped by the number of reﬂections.
For example, some ﬁelds spending an “extra” time 2δ
will have undergone two internal reﬂections, while some
will have undergone four.) We separate the transmission
coeﬃcient for each term into a real factor describing the
attenuation, and a complex factor giving the phase shift,
so that the total ﬁeld arriving at the observation point is
written

integer, so that the steady-state transmission is a minimum.
The time units correspond to the round-trip time through

Some examples of the eﬀects of simple dielectric lay-
ers on square pulses are illustrated in Fig. 1. The top
graph in the ﬁgure illustrates the time-dependence of the
transmission through a single layer whose optical path
length is (m+ 1/4)λ, so that ei2πcδA/λ =
1, correspond-
ing to a minimum in the steady-state transmission. The
ﬁrst arrival of the transmitted pulse is delayed by δB,
and this early arriving ﬁeld is larger in magnitude than
the rest of the pulse because at this time there are not
yet any interference eﬀects reducing the ﬁeld. The lower
graph displays transmission through a three-layer mir-
ror. The additional layers result in an increased delay
in the arrival of the leading edge and a reduction in the
steady-state transmission coeﬃcient. The additional lay-
ers also result in an enhancement of the large magnitude
of the leading-edge (when compared to the steady-state
transmission). The relatively large early-time transmis-
sion lasts for times on the order of δA, the time between
arrival of ﬁelds corresponding to terms in Eq. (4). Note,
though, that for multi-layer mirrors it takes more time
for the eﬀects of all of the multiple reﬂections to “turn
on” at the observation point, and it takes longer for the
transmitted pulse to settle down to the steady-state in-
tensity.

The net eﬀect of the layered dielectric is to create a
transmitted ﬁeld whose ﬁrst arrival is delayed by δB, but
whose temporal intensity proﬁle is reshaped so that there
is relatively more intensity at early times compared to
the intensity proﬁle of the vacuum pulse. This shifting
of intensity to relatively earlier times contributes to an
eﬀective advance of the pulse. If a single arrival time is
to be assigned to a pulse (or a photon), the relative role
of these two eﬀects must be accounted for when under-

We note that for wavelengths corresponding to trans-
mission maxima, the intensity proﬁles would diﬀer from
those illustrated in Fig. 1. The time of ﬁrst arrival would
be unchanged, but the initial ﬁeld would be relatively
low, and would take time to “build up” to its steady-state
value. The resulting pulse proﬁle would show relatively
more intensity at later times compared to the proﬁle of
the vacuum pulse, contributing to an eﬀective delay.

B. Transmission of slowly varying pulses

For smoothly varying pulses any reshaping eﬀects will
be much smaller than those illustrated for square pulses
in the previous section, but the transmitted pulse is built
up from multiple reﬂections in much the same way. For
pulses that vary slowly enough, the transmitted pulse
that is constructed in this way will have the same shape
as the incident pulse. We demonstrate that the transmit-
ted pulse may be constructed such that it is delayed or
advanced relative to the vacuum pulse. (No violation of
causality is implied, and the intensity of the transmitted
pulse is always lower than that of the vacuum pulse.)

For simplicity we consider a portion of an incident
pulse with linear amplitude modulation, and assume that
the linear modulation has been in eﬀect since a time t0,
so that the incident ﬁeld can be written

E1(t) =

E0 [1 + m(t

−

t0)] e−iωt.

(8)

In the following analysis we assume that the round trip
time within the slab is much less than the time that the
t0). This
modulation has been in eﬀect, i.e., δA ≪
means that a very large number of the terms in a series
like that of Eq. (4) have “turned on,” and the transmitted
ﬁeld is

Comparing the expression for the transmitted ﬁeld
given by Eq. (11) to that of the incident ﬁeld, Eq. (8),
shows that the net result of the multiple reﬂections is an
eﬀective time delay of the linearly changing ﬁeld given
by

δeﬀective = δB + δARe

(12)
This eﬀective delay can be positive, corresponding to
a true delay, or it can be negative, corresponding to an
advance. The exact value of the delay depends on the
indices of refraction in the material comprising the mirror
and the number of layers in the mirror.

The ﬁrst term in Eq. (12), δB, is simply the delay due
to the reduced speed of wave-fronts within the dielectric
materials. It is always a positive quantity, correspond-
ing to an actual delay. The second term contains the
more complicated eﬀects of phased reﬂections, and may
be positive or negative. If it is negative and greater in
magnitude than δB, the multiple reﬂection eﬀects that
led to the reshaping of square pulses dominate over the
eﬀect of reduced wave-front velocity, and the total de-
lay is negative. It is important to note that the eﬀective
time delay does not arise from the simple shifting of the
incident ﬁeld at a given time to a new time. Rather,
the eﬀective delay is the result of the superposition of
attenuated and phase-shifted ﬁelds from many previous
times.

Pulses will maintain their shapes and exhibit delays
given by δeﬀective as long as the time scale characteriz-
ing the modulation is long compared to δA, the time be-
tween the arrival of successive reﬂections. The peak of
the transmitted pulse may arrive after the peak of the
vacuum pulse would have arrived, or before. This is be-
cause the transmitted pulse is not the result of simple
attenuation of the incident peak, but rather it is con-
structed from the superposition of many reﬂections, as
in Eq. (4). Slowly varying pulses are special in the sense
that the newly constructed pulse has the same shape as
the incident pulse. We emphasize that the eﬀective delay
does not apply to the arrival time of any feature associ-
ated with an abrupt change in the ﬁeld; the arrival of the
leading edge of any disturbance associated with such an
abrupt change will be delayed by δB.

We conclude this section by demonstrating that the
eﬀective delay given by Eq. (12) is identical to that pre-
dicted by the conventional group delay, which is the
derivative of the phase of the transmission amplitude
with respect to angular frequency. Experimental mea-
surements of delays have been consistent with the group
delay, and our time-domain approach gives a physical
picture of the origin of the observed delays.

which is equal to δeﬀective, the eﬀective delay given by
Eq. (12), which was derived above from time-domain con-
siderations.

The equivalence (for slowly varying pulses) of the
group delay with the eﬀective delay derived in the time-
domain is a further demonstration that the group delay
has a physical meaning, even in cases in which it results
in a seemingly anomalous advance in the peak of the
transmitted pulse relative to the peak of a vacuum pulse.
For pulses which vary rapidly on the time-scale given by
δA there will be signiﬁcant distortion of the shape of the
pulse that will depend on the details of the pulse shape
and the characteristics of the dielectric mirror. Any dis-
cussion of delays for such pulses must carefully account
for such distortions in a way that is beyond the scope of
the present analysis.

III. PROPAGATION OF SINGLE-PHOTON
QUANTUM FIELDS

In the preceding section we discussed the eﬀects of lay-
ered dielectric materials on the propagation of classical
ﬁelds, but the experimental determinations of propaga-
tion time cited above involved the detection of individual
photons. In this section we demonstrate a way in which
the time-domain picture presented for classical ﬁelds can
be extended to single-photon quantum ﬁelds. We develop
a model in which an excited atom spontaneously emits
a quantized multimode photon, and we investigate the
time-dependent probability for excitation of a detector
atom located on the opposite side of a dielectric mir-
ror from the emitting atom. The time dependent exci-
tation probability displays interference eﬀects that are
exact analogs to those experienced by classical ﬁelds.

A. Quantum Model

We consider a large one-dimensional multimode opti-
cal cavity of total length L which contains a symmetric
dielectric mirror in the center of the cavity. (See Fig. 2.)

FIG. 2: Quantum model consisting of a pair of two-level
atoms at ﬁxed positions in a large multimode optical cav-
ity. A dielectric mirror is centered in the cavity. We quantize
the modes of the inhomogeneous cavity. The atom on the left
begins in the excited state and is the source of a photon; the
atom on the right serves as a detector.

The mirror is comprised of layers of homogeneous linear
dielectric like that considered in Sec. II. We ﬁnd the clas-
sical standing-wave modes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in
a cavity that includes the dielectric material, and quan-
tize the modes of this inhomogeneous cavity.

The cavity also contains a pair two-level atoms at ﬁxed
positions z1 and z2 on opposite sides of the dielectric re-
gion. The atom at z1 is initially in the excited state and
spontaneously emits a photon into the quantized modes
of the cavity; it serves as the source of the quantized ﬁeld
to be transmitted through the mirror. The atom at z2
begins in the ground state and serves as a detector of the
transmitted radiation. (It is also possible to determine
equivalent information about the transmitted radiation
from quantities involving ﬁeld operators such as the ex-
pectation value of the intensity operator,
[5].
We use the excitation of a two-level atom because of the
ease with which can compute this quantity to high pre-
cision in our model.)

ˆE− ˆE+
h

i

The cavity is assumed to be large, in the sense that the
length L is very much greater than the wavelength of the
light emitted by the atoms, i.e., this is not a microcavity.
The ﬁnite length L does not contribute to the physical
phenomena under investigation; it simply provides a con-
venient quantization volume for the ﬁeld modes used in
our calculations.

We use a standard Hamiltonian of quantum optics to
calculate the time evolution of the system, and pay par-
ticular attention to the amplitude for the atom on the
right side of the cavity to be found in the excited state.
We note that the eﬀects of the spontaneously emitted
photon propagate causally in this model. The explicit
form of the Hamiltonian we use is [6, 7, 8]

in which the atoms are labeled with the index j and the
ﬁeld modes with index m, and where ω(at) is the zero-ﬁeld

and creation operators for the mth mode, σ(j)

z
and gjm gives the coupling of the jth atom to the mth ﬁeld
mode. In this Hamiltonian we have made the standard
electric-dipole and rotating-wave approximations.

+ , σ(j)

The mode frequencies ωm in the Hamiltonian are sim-
ply those of the classical standing wave modes of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld. The spatial mode functions are nor-
malized so that the energy per photon in the quantized
modes is ¯hωm. The relative magnitudes of the coupling
constants gjm reﬂect the spatial dependence of the clas-
sical mode functions, speciﬁcally the relative magnitude
of the mode functions at the positions of the two atoms.
Calculation of the mode frequencies and spatial mode
functions for the inhomogeneous cavity involves the so-
lution of a classical boundary value problem. This is a
straightforward process in principle, although the large
number of boundaries in a multi-layer dielectric mirror
leads to algebraic complexity. We used transfer matrix
methods [9] (adapted to electromagnetic standing waves)
and the “shooting method” [10] to determine numerically
the mode frequencies.

In the limit of a large cavity we may assume that the
frequencies of all atomic transitions are very much greater
In this
than the fundamental frequency of the cavity.
limit we can make the approximation that all modes that
inﬂuence the dynamics of the system are near the atomic
resonance, and the atom-ﬁeld coupling constants can be
factored into a product of a frequency-independent con-
stant and a space-dependent coupling factor. The cou-
pling constants gjm are given in terms of the electric
dipole matrix element dj between the two levels of atom
j, the eﬀective volume of the cavity V , a mode-dependent
normalization factor
Nm, and the permittivity of free
space ǫ0, by

which is independent of the cavity mode-frequency. For
symmetrically place atoms, modes with even spatial
mode functions yield coupling constants with the same
sign for each atom; odd mode functions give coupling
constants of opposite signs. In performing our numerical
calculations we use an equal number of modes above and
below the atomic resonance frequency.

and we pay particular attention to the complex ampli-
tude c2(t) for the detector atom to be found in the ex-
cited state. Although it is diﬃcult physically to prepare
a state which corresponds to our initial condition, this
idealized state has the advantage that at t = 0 all of the
energy is localized at a single point (the position of the
excited atom), making causal wavefronts evolving from
this state particularly easy to identify. (A visualization of
the propagation of the wavefronts of the intensity of the
quantum ﬁeld in similar models is presented in [11, 12].)

B. Method of Solution

It is possible to ﬁnd analytical solutions for the time
evolution of atom-cavity systems with a single photon in
simple inhomogeneous cavities [13], but the complexity
of the mode structure for a cavity with a many-layered
mirror makes this approach intractable. Therefore we
construct numerical solutions for the coeﬃcients c1(t),
c2(t) and bk(t) of Eq. (18).

We use the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation to
of the
determine the energies Eq and eigenstates

then straightforward to calculate. If the system begins

tines to determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors used
in these equations. We consider systems with as many
as 2,000 modes, which leads to large matrix representa-
tions of the Hamiltonian, but the the matrix is sparse.
Our approach is similar to that used previously in several
studies [11, 12, 14].

C. Reshaping of single photon “pulses”

The graphs of this section demonstrate the analogy
between the classical ﬁeld and the quantum amplitude
to ﬁnd the detector atom in the excited state. The to-
tal quantum amplitude is the result of interference from
multiple reﬂections in very much the same way as the
classical ﬁeld is the result of multiple reﬂections. In this
section we present results for three cavities: an empty,
or vacuum cavity, a cavity with a simple homogeneous
dielectric region, and a cavity containing a dielectric mir-
ror. The results for the simple cavity help elucidate the
more complicated behavior seen in the propagation of
through the dielectric mirror.

For atoms in an empty cavity with no dielectric mirror
it is possible to ﬁnd an analytic solution for the dynam-
ics [15]. The probability for the source atom to be in
the excited state decays exponentially with decay con-
2L/c until the time at which reﬂections
stant γ1 =
ﬁrst interrupt the decay; for atomic positions z1 =
.25L
and z2 = .25L this decay proceeds until reﬂections return
to the atom time t = 0.5L/c. For atoms at these posi-
tions the amplitude to ﬁnd the detector atom in the ex-
cited state remains identically zero until time t = 0.5L/c,
the time at which radiation can ﬁrst reach the detector.
Choosing units such that L/c = 1 (which we will use for
the remainder of the article) the amplitude to ﬁnd detec-
tor atom in the excited state in an empty cavity is [15]

FIG. 3: Detector atom excitation probability in an empty
cavity. The source atom decay rate is γ1 = 16 and the detector
atom rate is γ2 = 256. The rapid rise at t = 1/2 is due
to the arrival of the ﬁeld at atom 2. The rate of the rise is
determined by the detector response, and the slow exponential
decay reﬂects the exponential shape of the pulse passing the
detector atom.

In the limit of very fast detector atom response, i.e.,
, the amplitude c2(t) will instantaneously re-
γ2 → ∞
ﬂect the strength of the ﬁeld incident on the detector
atom. Fig. 3 illustrates the detector atom response for
the case γ1 = 16 and γ2 = 256. The rapid rise reﬂects
the response of the detector atom to the sudden arrival at
t = 0.5 of radiation from the source atom, and occurs on
the time scale given by 1/γ2. The slower decline reﬂects
the exponential shape of the radiation pulse emitted by
the source as it passes by the detector atom [11, 12].
While in a given run of an actual experiment the excita-
tion of the detector atom will be observed at a particular
instant of time, the evolution of the excitation probabil-
ity is continuous, and resembles the excitation expected
for a classical oscillator driven by a classical ﬁeld pulse.
An illustration of the eﬀect of a single dielectric slab
on a pulse is given in Fig. 4. This ﬁgure gives the time-
dependence of the detector atom excitation probability
after transmission of the radiation through a single di-
electric slab whose width and index are chosen so that
the classical delays are δA = 0.05 and δB = 0.015 in the
units of the ﬁgure. Because the decay rate of the source
atom is relatively slow, this ﬁgure is analogous to the top
graph in Fig. 1, which gives the intensity of a classical
square pulse after passing through a single slab of dielec-
tric material. The excitation of the detector atom “turns
on” at the expected classical time, 0.5 + δB, and is inter-
rupted at multiples of δA, the classical round-trip time

within the material. The excitation probability “settles
down” to an attenuated and delayed version of the vac-
uum “pulse” of Eq. (25), where the attenuation factor is
given by the classical

The data points in the ﬁgure are the result of the fully
quantum mechanical calculations described in Sec. III B,
while the solid line combines the quantum results for exci-
tation in an empty cavity with the classical techniques for
multiple reﬂections. In Sec. II the classical ﬁeld is built
up from a sum of appropriately attenuated, delayed, and
phase shifted ﬁelds in Eq. (4); the solid line in Fig. 4 is
built up from attenuated, delayed, and phase shifted ver-
sions of the quantum excitation amplitude Eq. (25) using
the same classical attenuation, delay, and phase shift pa-
rameters that were used to produce the upper graph in

The same principles apply to propagation through
more complicated dielectric mirror structures. The ex-
citation amplitude after transmission through an 11 el-
ement mirror with alternating high and low index re-
gions is illustrated in Fig. 5. This mirror is similar to
the (HL)5H mirror used in the experiments of references

The eﬀects of the abrupt turn-on of the excitation are
evident in the large variations in the early-time detection
probability before the eﬀects of multiple reﬂection have
taken full eﬀect. These variations are analogous to those
in Figs. 1 and 4, but they last longer in this case be-
cause of the relatively large number of layers comprising

FIG. 5: Detector atom excitation in a cavity with an (HL)5H

of the mirror elements is such that the classical delays are
δA ≃ 0.002 and δB ≃ 0.0057. The data points are the result

turn-on of the excitation of the detector atom. (Note that
the vertical scale on this graph corresponds to amplitude
rather than probability; the amplitude can assume nega-
tive values just as the classical ﬁeld E2 can.) As in Fig. 4,
the data points are the result of the fully quantum me-
chanical calculations, while the solid line combines the
quantum results for excitation in an empty cavity from
Eq. (25) with the classical techniques for multiple reﬂec-
tions as in Eq. (26). There is no excitation before the
time t = 0.5 + δB, and at later times the excitation is
interrupted after successive multiples of the single-layer
round trip time δA. We call attention to the vastly diﬀer-
ent excitation probabilities at early and late times. The
initial large peaks occur before the eﬀects of multiple re-
ﬂection have reduced the transmission.

The ﬁnite rise time evident in the lower graph in Fig. 5
is determined by the response of the detector atom char-
acterized by γ2. A more rapid detector response would
show a more abrupt rise which more closely follows the
step-function turn-on of the ﬁeld at the detector atom.
The modeling of more rapid changes would require the
inclusion of more modes in our numerical analysis.

The transmission of a photon from the source through
a dielectric mirror and to the detector can happen via
many indistinguishable pathways: it can travel directly
without undergoing reﬂection; it may undergo a single
reﬂection in one of many ways, or it may undergo mul-
tiple reﬂections. The numerical results of this section
demonstrate that the excitation amplitude for the de-
tector atom is built up from interfering amplitudes for
all of these processes in exactly the same way that the
the classical transmitted ﬁeld is built up from multiple
reﬂections.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have examined the transmission of radiation
through layered dielectric mirrors in the time domain.
For slowly varying classical pulses we have derived a for-
mula for pulse delays that takes into account the time-
domain buildup of the steady-state transmission. The ﬁ-
nite time that it takes to build up this steady-state trans-
mission results in pulse reshaping, and our formula helps
delineate the competing eﬀects of pulse reshaping and
the reduced front velocities in dielectric materials. The
delays calculated in our model are equivalent to those
calculated from the conventional group delay, but our
model provides an aid to understanding and interpreting
the origin of the anomalous delay times that have been
observed in experiments.

We have also demonstrated that our interpretation can
be extended to include quantized ﬁelds. We have studied
numerically a model in which a spontaneously emitted
photon propagates through a layered dielectric mirror,
and excites a detector atom. The quantum amplitude to
ﬁnd the atom in the excited state is the result of inter-
fering terms due to the possibility of multiple reﬂections

in much the same way that the classical ﬁeld is the re-
sult of the interference of multiply reﬂected ﬁelds. The
terms in the quantum amplitude “turn-on” at exactly the
same time as the classical ﬁeld terms, and with exactly
the same relative amplitudes and phases. Individual pho-
tons will be detected at a range of times described by this
amplitude, and it is the distribution of arrival times of
single photons that is shifted in time in exactly the same
way as the classical pulse is shifted.

We shortly recall the mathematical and physical aspects of Talbot’s self-imaging
eﬀect occurring in near-ﬁeld diﬀraction. In the rational paraxial approximation,
the Talbot images are formed at distances z = p/q, where p and q are coprimes,
and are superpositions of q equally spaced images of the original binary trans-
mission (Ronchi) grating. This interpretation oﬀers the possibility to express the
Talbot eﬀect through Gauss sums. We pay attention to the Talbot eﬀect in the
case of dispersion in optical ﬁbers presenting our considerations based on the
close relationships of the mathematical representations of diﬀraction and disper-
sion. Although dispersion deals with continuous functions, such as gaussian and
supergaussian pulses, whereas in diﬀraction one frequently deals with discontin-
uous functions, the mathematical correspondence enables one to characterize the
Talbot eﬀect in the two cases with minor diﬀerences. In addition, we apply, for
the ﬁrst time to our knowledge, the wavelet transform to the fractal Talbot eﬀect
in both diﬀraction and dispersion.

1. Introduction

Near ﬁeld diﬀraction can produce images of periodic structures (say, grat-
ings of spatial period a) without any other means. This is known since 1836
when this self-imaging phenomenon has been discovered by H.F. Talbot,
one of the inventor pioneers of photography.1 The images (see Fig. 1) are
produced at a (“focal”) distance known as Talbot’s distance zT = a2λ−1 (al-
though obtained by Lord Rayleigh in 1881,2) and also at integer multiples
of it. An excellent review on the Talbot eﬀect has been written in 1989 by
Patorski.3

In 1996, Berry and Klein,4 showed,in the framework of Helmholtz equa-
tion approach to the physical optics of a δ-comb grating, that the Talbot
diﬀraction waveﬁeld has a highly interesting arithmetic structure related to
Gauss’s sums and other fundamental relationships in number theory. In this
paper, after brieﬂy reviewing the results of Berry & Klein, we show that
analogous results can be obtained easily for the case of dispersion in linear
optical ﬁbers. Moreover, we apply for the ﬁrst time in the literature the
wavelet transform to the fractal Talbot problem.

2. Talbot eﬀect for Helmholtz scalar diﬀraction ﬁelds

The scalar wave solution Ψ(ξ, ζ) of the Helmholtz equation for a Ronchi
grating can be expressed as a convolution in the ξ transverse dimensionless
variable of the unit cell square function and the Dirac comb transmittance,
i.e.

Ψ(ξ, ζ) =

exp[i 2πn(ξ

)] exp[iΘs(ζ)] .

This can be written as an inﬁnite sum of phase exponentials in both trans-
verse ξ variable and propagation ζ variable

where the amplitudes gn are the Fourier modes of the transmittance function
of the Ronchi grating

On the other hand, Θs is a phase produced by the diﬀraction of the Dirac
comb ‘diagonal’ rays. The so-called Fresnel approximation for Θs, i.e., a
Taylor expansion up to the second order for a square root coming from the
πζn2. Thus, the following form
‘diagonal’ feature of the ray, leads to Θs ≈ −

Ψ(ξ, ζ) =

gn exp(i2πnξ

gnψ(ξ, ζ) .

Furthermore, by discretizing the optical propagation axis ζ by means of
rational numbers, one can write the rational paraxial ﬁeld as a shifted delta
comb aﬀected by phase factors, which is the main result of Berry and Klein:

The paraxial phases exp[iφ] are expressed in terms of Gauss sums and there-
fore are the physical quantities directly connected to number theory. At the
same time, this rational approximation makes possible the following physical
interpretation of the paraxial self-imaging process: in each unit cell of the
plane p/q, q images of the grating slits are reproduced with spacing a/q and
intensity reduced by 1/q.

3. Wave propagation in optical ﬁbers

Field dispersion phenomena in dielectric media are described in terms of

wave equations with sources of the form

that can be obtained from the Maxwell equations under minimal assumptions
on the constitutive equations. As known, the terminology of dispersion in
the case of electromagnetic phenomena uses the basic concept of propagation
constant for each frequency mode ω. It is deﬁned as the phase velocity of
the mode ω/c times the corresponding index of refraction of the mode n(ω).
In the following we will use one of the simplest optical ﬁbers having a core-
cladding step proﬁle of the index of refraction. In addition, the famous slowly
varying envelope approximation (henceforth SVEA) is a realistic approach
when treating the propagation of quasi-monochromatic ﬁelds, such as laser
ﬁelds and other types of coherent beams within such materials. For more
details we refer the reader to textbooks.5

SVEA means decomposing the electromagnetic ﬁelds in two factors: a
rapidly varying phase component and a slowly varying amplitude ﬁeld A
enveloping the rapid oscillatory ﬁelds. The following Schr¨odinger-like dis-
persion equation can be obtained for A in the SVEA approximation

where β2 is the second coeﬃcient in the Taylor expansion of the propagation
constant (around the central resonance frequency). This is the simplest form
of the dispersion equation that one can envision in which actually no material
propagation shows up. It can be fulﬁlled in the practical situation when the
ωr). Because of technological
dielectric medium has sharp resonances (δωr ≪
requirements, β2 is usually a negative parameter corresponding to the so-
called anomalous dispersion region. As can be seen, the SVEA equation
has exactly the same mathematical form as the diﬀraction equation in the
paraxial approximation:

where Ψp is the electric ﬁeld close to the propagation axis.

using the following substitutions

This change of variables will be used here to compare the results obtained
in the two frameworks.

The general solution of the SVEA dispersion equation (7) for the ampli-
tude A(z, ˜t) in the case of initial conditions in the form of a periodic input
ne−iωn˜t at the entrance of an optical ﬁber with linear
signal A(0, ˜t) =

Just as in the context of diﬀraction, the convolution of the unitary cell with

can be thought of as the analog of the paraxial propagator.4 In this expres-
sion, the trick is to turn the continuous propagation axis into the rational
number axis and also to perform the integer modulo division of n with re-
spect to the rational denominator of the propagation axis, i.e.,

ζ =

If one tries to make computer simulations using the Fourier transform
method, the Gibbs oscillatory eﬀect is unavoidable for discontinuous trans-
mittance functions. However, in the case of ﬁber dispersion, one class of
continuous pulses one could work with are the supergaussian ones, i.e., func-
tions of the following form

where N is any even number bigger than two. The bigger the chosen N
the more the supergaussian pulse resembles a square pulse. A computer
simulation of the evolution of a supergaussian pulse train is given in Fig. 2.7

5. Irrational Talbot distances

5.1. Fractal approach

In the Talbot terminology the self-reconstructed images in the planes
z = (p/q)zT consist of q superposed copies of the grating as already men-
tioned, completed with discontinuities. Although there is a ﬁnite number of
images at fractional distances, they still represent an inﬁnitesimal subset of
all possible images that occur at the irrational distances.

However, in the planes located at irrational fractions of the Talbot dis-
tance the light intensity is a fractal function of the transverse variable. The
ﬁeld intensity has a deﬁnite value at every point, but its derivative has no
deﬁnite value. Such fractal functions are described by a fractal dimension,
D, between one (corresponding to a smooth curve) and two (corresponding
to a curve so irregular that it occupies a ﬁnite area). In the case of Ronchi
gratings, for example, the fractal dimension of the diﬀracted intensity in the
irrrational transverse planes is 3/2.8

Moreover, one can deﬁne the so-called carpets which are wave intensity
patterns forming surfaces on the (ξ , ζ) plane, i.e., the plane of the transverse
periodic coordinate and the propagation coordinate. Since they are surfaces,
their fractal dimension takes values between two and three. According to
Berry, in general for a surface where all directions are equivalent, the fractal
dimension of the surface is one unit greater than the dimension of an inclined
curve that cuts through it. Taking into account that for a Talbot carpet the
transverse image curves have fractal dimension D = 3/2, then the carpet’s
dimension is expected to be 5/2. However, Talbot landscapes were found not
to be isotropic. For ﬁxed ξ, as the intensity varies as a function of distance ζ
from the grating, the fractal dimension is found to be 7/4, one quarter more
than in the transverse case. Therefore the longitudinal fractals are slightly
more irregular than the transverse ones. In addition, the intensity is more
regular along the bisectrix canal because of the cancelation of large Fourier
components that has fractal dimension of 5/4. The landscape is dominated
by the largest of these fractal dimensions (the longitudinal one), and so is a
surface of fractal dimension 1+ 7/4 = 11/4.

5.2. Wavelet approach

It is interesting to apply the wavelet transform which is known to have
various advantages over the Fourier transform and can add up supplementary
information with respect to the fractal features. In the wavelet framework

Talbot eﬀect for dispersion in linear optical ﬁbers

one can write the expansion of an arbitrary signal x(t) in an orthonormal
wavelet basis in the form

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

where the coeﬃcients of the expansion are given by

x(t) =

ψm,n(t) = 2m/2ψ(2mt

n) ,

−

and the orthonormal wavelet basis functions fulﬁll the following dilation-
translation property

where m and n are the dilation and translation indices, respectively.

To this end, one can calculate spectral quantities of interest, such as the
power spectrum, by means of wavelet transforms in order to study the Talbot
fractal eﬀect. For self-similar random processes the spectral behavior of the
power spectrum is given by,9,10

Sx(ω)

where βF is the spectral parameter. In addition, the variance of the wavelet
coeﬃcients possesses the following behavior,10

These formulas are certainly suitable for the Talbot transverse fractals
because of the interpretation in terms of the regular superposition of identical
and equally spaced grating images. We have used these wavelet formulas in
our calculations related to the rational paraxial transverse ﬁelds (Fig. 3)
In the case of
and the associated ﬁber-dispersed optical ﬁelds (Fig. 4).
supergaussian pulses, the latter ones turned out not to have the self-similarity
property (see Fig. 4). In Figs. 5 and 6 the behavior of the wavelet transform
using Morlet wavelets for the diﬀraction ﬁeld is displayed. A great deal of
details can be seen in all basic quantities of the diﬀracted ﬁeld, namely in
the intensity, modulus, and phase. On the other hand, the same wavelet
transform applied to the N=12 supergaussian dispersed pulse (see Figs. 7
and 8), although showing a certain similarity to the previous discontinuous
case, contains less structure and thus looks more regular. This points to
the fact that if in diﬀraction experiments one uses continuous transmittance
gratings the fractal behavior would turn milder.

More realistically, paraxial waves display electric and magnetic singularities.11

It is worth pointing out that detection of signal singularities has been stud-
ied in quite detail by the experts in wavelet processing.12 We plan to study
this aspect in future research.

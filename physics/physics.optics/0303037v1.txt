INTRODUCTION

Wave propagation in periodic layered media is very
similar to the motion of electrons in crystallyne solids
(hence, they are also known as photonic crystals). Thus,
it is hardly surprising that some well-established con-
cepts of solid-state physics (such as Bloch waves, Bril-
louin zones, and forbidden bands) have been incorporated
in the doctrine of photonic crystals [1].

The standard approach [2] identiﬁes the periodic struc-
ture with a one-dimensional lattice that is invariant un-
der lattice translations, which requires the system to be
strictly inﬁnite. Of course, this is unattainable in prac-
tice. In solid-state physics one goes around this diﬃculty
by considering that the one-dimensional lattice closes
into a ring; i.e., by imposing periodic boundary condi-
tions. While this seems to be reasonable for a lattice of
atoms, is obviously unfeasible for periodically stratiﬁed
media.

In spite of this fact, only under the assumption of an
endlessly repeating stack of dielectric slabs this standard
treatment gets an eigenvalue equation for the Bloch fac-
tor and then one ﬁnds [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] that strong reﬂection
(stop bands) occurs when the trace of the 2 × 2 matrix
describing the basic period exceeds 2 in magnitude.

In practice not very many periods (say, ten) are needed
to have a stop band. Therefore, one is led to consider
stacks of N periods, which are often appropriately called
“ﬁnite” periodic structures [8]. The matrix describing
these structures can be computed as the N th power of the
basic period in terms of Chebyshev polynomials [9, 10].
This gives an exact expression for the reﬂectance, but so
complicated that it is diﬃcult to get, at ﬁrst glance, any
feeling about the performance of the system. Moreover,
the distinction between allowed and forbidden bands is
obtained only numerically.

The aim of this paper is to provide an alternative set-
ting for dealing with these ﬁnite periodic structures that
stresses the diﬀerent scaling laws appearing in the re-
ﬂectance. To this end we resort to the Iwasawa decom-
position to represent the action of any multilayer as the
product of three fundamental matrices of simple interpre-
tation. We show that these matrices present quite dis-
tinct reﬂectances. The trace of the basic period allows us
to classify periodic structures in three types with prop-
erties closely related to one (and only one) of the three
fundamental matrices. Finally, we study the reﬂectance
associated to each one of these types.

The advantage of this approach is, in our view, twofold:
it naturally emphasizes the diﬀerent laws for the for-
bidden bands, allowed bands, and band edges and, at
the same time, provides universal expressions remarkably
simple for the corresponding reﬂectances.

II. THE ORIGIN OF THE BANDGAP IN
INFINITE PERIODIC STRUCTURES

To keep the discussion as self-contained as possible, we
ﬁrst brieﬂy summarize the essential ingredients of mul-
tilayer optics that we shall need for our purposes. The
basic period of the structure is illustrated in Fig. 1 and
consists of a stack of 1, . . . , j, . . . , m plane-parallel layers
sandwiched between two semi-inﬁnite ambient (a) and
substrate (s) media, which we shall assume to be iden-
tical, since this is the common experimental case. Here-
after all the media are supposed to be lossless, homoge-
neous, and isotropic.

We consider an incident monochromatic linearly polar-
ized plane wave from the ambient that makes an angle θ0
with the normal to the ﬁrst interface and has amplitude
E(+)
. The electric ﬁeld is either in the plane of inci-
a
dence (p polarization) or perpendicular to the plane of
incidence (s polarization). We consider as well another
plane wave of the same frequency and polarization, and
with amplitude E(−)
, incident from the substrate at the
same angle θ0.

s

As a result of multiple reﬂections in all the inter-
faces [11], we have a backward-traveling plane wave in
the ambient, denoted E(−)
, and a forward-traveling plane
wave in the substrate, denoted E(+)
. If we take the ﬁeld

(cid:18)

which applies to both ambient and substrate media, then
the amplitudes at each side of the multilayer are related
by the 2×2 complex matrix Mas, we shall call the transfer
matrix, in the form

The matrix Mas can be shown to be of the form [12, 13]

where the complex numbers

Ras = |Ras| exp(iρ),

Tas = |Tas| exp(iτ ),

(4)

are, respectively, the overall reﬂection and transmission
coeﬃcients for a wave incident from the ambient. Note
that we have det Mas = +1, which is equivalent to
|Ras|2 + |Tas|2 = 1, and then the set of lossless multilayer
matrices reduces to the group SU(1,1), whose elements
depend on three independent real parameters [14, 15].

The identity matrix corresponds to Tas = 1 and Ras =
0, so it represents an antireﬂection system without trans-
mission phase shift. The matrix that describes the over-
all system obtained by putting two multilayers together
is the product of the matrices representing each one of
them, taken in the appropriate order. So, two multilay-
ers, which are inverse, when composed give an antireﬂec-
tion system.

When we repeat the basic period Mas the ﬁelds at the

nth cell are given by

are obtained by setting [Tr(Mas)]2 = 4. Such a peri-
odic structure exhibits resonance reﬂection very much
like the diﬀraction of X rays by crystal lattice planes and,
in consequence, it is usually called a Bragg reﬂector [2].
By properly designing the basic period it is possible to
achieve extremely high reﬂectance for some selected spec-
tral region [16].

As anticipated in the Introduction, an inﬁnite multi-
layer is unrealistic in practice, and one should consider
N -period ﬁnite structures, for which the previous stan-
dard approach fails [17, 18].

The overall transfer matrix M(N )

for a N -period struc-
ture is equal to (Mas)N . Explicit but complicated for-
mulas for the corresponding matrix elements exist [9, 10],
but they do not give analytic expressions for the bandgap
and are diﬃcult to analyze.

as

We have recently advocated using the Iwasawa decom-
position to study layered media [19], since it provides a
remarkable factorization of the matrix representing any
multilayer (no matter how complicated it could be) as
the product of three matrices of simple interpretation.
The decomposition can be stated as

Mas = K(φ)A(ξ)N(ν),

(9)

where

~En+1 = Mas ~En.

~En+1 = λ ~En,

(Mas − λ) ~En = 0,

In an inﬁnite structure the Floquet theorem ensures that
these cells are equivalent and so the two vectors in Eq. (5)
are proportional [2, 8]

The parameters φ, ξ, and ν are given in terms of the
elements of the multilayer matrix by

and therefore the Bloch factor λ is determined as the
eigenvalue of the basic-period transfer matrix Mas:

which gives

λ2 − [Tr(Mas)]λ + 1 = 0.

If [Tr(Mas)]2 > 4, the solution grows or decays exponen-
tially and no propagating wave is possible (stop band).
On the contrary, Bloch waves appear in this algebraic
approach when [Tr(Mas)]2 < 4 and then the matrix Mas
has two eigenvalues (allowed band). The band edges

φ/2 = arg(α + iβ) ,
ξ/2 = ln(1/|α + iβ|) ,
ν/2 = Re(αβ

∗

)/|α + iβ|2 ,

(11)

and their ranges are ξ, ν ∈ R and −2π ≤ φ ≤ 2π. Now,
we can interpret the physical action of the matrices ap-
pearing in Eq. (9). K(φ) represents the free propagation
of the ﬁelds ~E in the ambient medium through an optical
phase thickness of φ/2, which reduces to a mere shift of
the origin of phases. Alternatively, this can be seen as an
antireﬂection system. The second matrix A(ξ) represents
a symmetric system with real transmission coeﬃcient
TA = sech(ξ/2) and reﬂection phase shift ρA = ±π/2.
Finally, the third matrix, N(ν), represents a system hav-
ing TN = cos(τN) exp(iτN) and RN = sin(τN) exp(iτN),

with tan(τN) = ν/2. In Ref. [12] we have provided sim-
ple examples of realistic systems that accomplish these
requirements.

For our purposes here, the essential point is that the
reﬂectance R = |R|2 associated to each one of these ma-
trices is

RK = 0,
RA = tanh2(ξ/2),
RN = (ν/2)2/[1 + (ν/2)2].

(12)

While RK is identically zero, RA and RN tend to unity
when ξ and ν, respectively, increase. However, they have
distinct growth: RA goes to unity exponentially, while
RN goes as O(ν−2).

The Iwasawa decomposition proves also to be a pow-
erful tool for the classiﬁcation of layered media. Indeed,
after Ref. [20] one is led to introduce the following cri-
terion: a matrix is of type K when [Tr(Mas)]2 < 4, is
of type A when [Tr(Mas)]2 > 4, and ﬁnally is of type N
when [Tr(Mas)]2 = 4. Although this trace criterion has
an elegant geometrical interpretation [13] and coincides
with the one giving the stop bands in Eq. (8), let us re-
mark that if a multilayer has a transfer matrix Mas of
type K, A, or N, one can always ﬁnd a family of matrices
C [also in SU(1,1)] such that

Mas = C Mas C−1

(13)

b

is just a matrix K(φ), A(ξ), or N(ν), respectively.
This conjugation by C preserves the trace: Tr(
Mas) =
Tr(Mas). Moreover, Eq. (13) allows us to recast the mul-
tilayer action in Eq. (2) as

b

where the new ﬁeld vectors are

b

~Ea =

b

In other words, the matrix C gives a new vector basis
such that the basic period of the system, when viewed in
such a basis, presents a reﬂectance exactly of the form in
Eq. (12). This provides a full characterization of the re-
ﬂectance of any periodic system, as we shall demonstrate
in next Section.

IV. CHARACTERIZING THE THREE
FUNDAMENTAL BEHAVIORS OF THE
REFLECTANCE

Since the matrix

Mas associated to the basic period
belongs to one of the subgroups K(φ), A(ξ), or N(ν) of
the Iwasawa decomposition, and all these subgroups are,
in our special case, Abelian and uniparametric, we have
that

Mas(µ2) =

Mas(µ1 + µ2),

where µ represents the appropriate parameter φ, ξ, or ν.
For a N -period system the overall transfer matrix M(N )
is

which does not depend on the explicit form of the basic
period.

After Eq. (17), one must expect three universal behav-
iors of the reﬂectance according the basic-period transfer
matrix is of the type K, A or N. We shall work in what
follows the detailed structure of these three basic laws.

Because the stop bands are given by the condition
[Tr(Mas)]2 > 4, we ﬁrst consider the case when Mas is
of type A. Then, Eq. (13) gives

Mas = C−1 A(χ) C,

(18)

where we have denoted

Re(α) =

Tr (Mas) = cosh(χ) > 1,

(19)

1
2

because we are taking into account only positive values
of Re(α), since negative values can be treated much in
same way. If we put

C =

(20)

one solution of Eq. (18) is

c1 = F (β

c2 = −iF Im(α),

(21)

where the factor F is

(22)

F =

p

Carrying out the matrix multiplications in Eq. (17) it
is easy to obtain the reﬂectance of the N -period system
as

R(N )

A =

|β|2
|β|2 + [sinh(χ)/ sinh(N χ)]2 .

(23)

This is an exact expression for any value of N . As N
grows, R(N )
approaches unity exponentially, as one could
expect from a band stop.

A

The band edges are determined by the limit condition
[Tr(Mas)]2 = 4; that is, when Mas is of type N. A calcu-
lation very similar to the previous one shows that now

R(N )

N =

|β|2
|β|2 + (1/N )2 ,

(24)

with a typical behavior R(N )
N ∼ 1 − O(N −2) that is uni-
versal in the physics of reﬂection. The general results
(23) and (24) have been obtained in a diﬀerent frame-
work by Yeh [2] and Lekner [8].

4

Finally, in the allowed bands we have [Tr(Mas)]2 < 4;

Mas is of type K, and

scaling laws expressed by these equations are universal
features of the reﬂection in ﬁnite periodic systems.

K =

Q2 − 2Q cos(2N Ω)

where

Q =

|β|2 − |α − eiΩ|2 ,

(25)

(26)

and the phase Ω is determined by

iΩ = (Re α) + i

1 − (Re α)2.

(27)

p

Now the reﬂectance oscillates with N between the values
(Q2 − 2Q)/(Q − 1)2 and (Q2 + 2Q)/(Q + 1)2.

Equations (23), (24) and (25) are the three fundamen-
tal reﬂectances we were looking for. In our opinion, they
have the virtue of simplicity. In practice, the basic pe-
riod usually consists of two homogeneous layers and the
expressions become simpler [9]. We emphasize that the

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have used a trace criterion to provide in a direct
way three fundamental forms for the reﬂectance that are
universal for any multilayer. When the system is ﬁnite
periodic this result has allowed us to obtain in a direct
way explicit expressions for the reﬂectance of the overall
system.

This approach has physical meaning on its own, irre-
spective whether the system is periodic or not. Moreover,
it leads naturally to a further analysis of ﬁnite periodic
bandgap structures that does not need the strict require-
ment of inﬁnite periodicity, as it is assumed in the stan-
dard theory.

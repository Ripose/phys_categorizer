Fresnel equations and the refractive index of active media

Johannes Skaar
Department of Electronics and Telecommunications
Norwegian University of Science and Technology
(Dated: February 15, 2014)

There exists a class of realizable, active media for which the refractive index cannot be deﬁned as
an analytic function in the upper half-plane of complex frequency. The conventional deﬁnition of
the refractive index based on analyticity is modiﬁed such that it is valid for active media in general,
and associated Fresnel equations are proved. In certain active media, the presence of a “backward”
wave, for which both phase velocity and Poynting’s vector point towards the excitation source, is
demonstrated.

I.

INTRODUCTION

With the recent advances in the fabrication of pas-
sive materials and metamaterials [1, 2], it seems plausible
that novel classes of active materials may be developed.
While the basic electromagnetic concepts, such as micro-
scopic and relativistic causality, certainly apply to active
media, the analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation
may diﬀer. For example, the Fresnel equations for pas-
sive media state that at normal incidence, the transmit-
ted ﬁeld is proportional to exp(inωz/c), where n is the
refractive index, ω is the angular frequency, z is the co-
ordinate in the direction away from the boundary, and c
is the vacuum velocity of light. Since z is arbitrary, rel-
ativistic causality dictates n to be an analytic function
in the upper half of the complex ω-plane [3, 4]. On the
other hand, at least in principle there exist realizable, ac-
tive media for which n cannot be identiﬁed as an analytic
function in the upper half-plane. Indeed, consider an in-
verted Lorentz model with relative permittivity ǫ = 1
f ,
where f is given by

Here, F , ω0, and Γ are positive parameters. If F > 1, ǫ
has a simple zero in the upper half-plane. Thus, assuming
the relative permeability µ = 1, the refractive index n =
√ǫ√µ contains branch points in the upper half-plane.

These media would seem to violate relativistic causal-
ity. This is certainly not the case; to resolve this appar-
ent paradox, I will provide a rigorous derivation of the
Fresnel equations in the general case, and generalize the
deﬁnition of the refractive index so that it is valid for ac-
tive media. It will become clear that when the refractive
index contains branch points in the upper half-plane, the
Fresnel equations and the refractive index have no phys-
ical meaning for real frequencies. The Kramers-Kronig
relations for the refractive index must be modiﬁed ac-
cordingly.

As an extra bonus, the general framework in this pa-
per can be used to analyze novel classes of active media.
Recently, it has been suggested that certain active, non-
magnetic media with simultaneously passive and active

material resonances can yield negative refraction [5]. I
will consider the Fresnel equations for these types of ma-
terials, and demonstrate that at normal incidence, the
“backward” wave is excited so that both phase veloc-
ity and Poynting’s vector point towards the excitation
source. While negative refraction is found at oblique in-
cidence, it is shown that evanescent ﬁeld ampliﬁcation,
similarly to that in the Veselago-Pendry lens [6, 7], does
not happen.

The remaining of the paper is structured as follows:
In Section II the theory of the electromagnetic parame-
ters is reviewed. Section III contains an electromagnetic
analysis of a ﬁnite slab surrounded by vacuum. From
the resulting ﬁelds, the Fresnel equations are proved in
the general case, and the associated refractive index is
identiﬁed. The results are interpreted in the form of two
examples (Section IV), an inverted Lorentzian medium,
and a more complex medium featuring negative refrac-
tion.

II. THE ELECTROMAGNETIC PARAMETERS

Any electromagnetic medium must be causal in the mi-
croscopic sense; the polarization and magnetization can-
not precede the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, respectively.
This means that the relative permittivity ǫ(ω) and the
relative permeability µ(ω) obey the Kramers-Kronig re-

These conditions are equivalent to the fact that χ is an-
alytic in the upper half-plane (Im ω > 0), and uniformly
square integrable in the closed upper half-plane (Titch-
marsh’ theorem) [3, 11][12]. The susceptibilities are de-
ﬁned for negative frequencies by the symmetry relation

so that their inverse Fourier transforms are real. For
ease of discussion, in addition to (2) and (3) it is as-
sumed that the susceptibilities are continuous along the
real frequency axis [13].

For passive media, in addition to (2) and (3) we have:

Im χ(ω) > 0 for ω > 0.

(4)

The losses, as given by the imaginary parts of the sus-
ceptibilities, can be vanishingly small; however they are
always present unless we are considering vacuum [10].
Eqs. (2)-(4) imply that Im χ > 0 in the ﬁrst quadrant
(Re ω > 0 and Im ω
0), and that 1 + χ is zero-free in
the upper half-plane [10]. Thus for passive media, the
refractive index n = √ǫ√µ can always be chosen as an
analytic function in the upper half-plane. With the ad-
ditional choice that n

so Fourier transformed ﬁelds do not necessarily exist.
(Strictly speaking, in practical materials, the ﬁelds do
not diverge. When the ﬁelds become suﬃciently strong,
they deplete the gain. However, we restrict ourselves
to the linear regime of the susceptibilities, and bear in
mind that the model breaks down when the ﬁelds be-
come large. The divergences can be regarded as indica-
tors of self-oscillation (lasing).) Thus, instead of Fourier
transforms, we use Laplace transforms, and ﬁnd the total

sion coeﬃcient T to be

On the basis of causality, it is clear that the suscepti-
bilities of active media also satisfy (2) and (3). However,
since (4) does not hold for active media, it is no longer
true that ǫ and µ are zero-free in the upper half-plane.
Indeed, we have already seen that the permittivity asso-
ciated with an inverted Lorentz model may have a simple
zero in the upper half-plane. Thus, the refractive index
cannot always be chosen as an analytic function in the
upper half-plane.

To clarify this point, it is convenient to consider elec-
tromagnetic wave propagation in a one-dimensional, ac-
tive medium.
Initially, the active medium is assumed
to have ﬁnite thickness so that problems of specifying
is avoided. Sub-
the boundary conditions at z =
sequently, using the result of the ﬁnite slab in addition
to causality, the ﬁelds of a half-inﬁnite medium will be
determined.

III. ANALYSIS OF ACTIVE MEDIA

Consider a plane wave in vacuum, normally incident
to a linear, isotropic, and homogenous slab with parame-
ters ǫ and µ. While vacuum is chosen as the surrounding
medium, it should be clear that any other passive media
yield similar results. The slab is located in the region

The use of Laplace transform is reﬂected in that Im ω
≥
γ, for a suﬃciently large, real constant γ. For active
media, γ > 0 in general, i.e., R, S, and T may contain
poles in the upper half-plane.

Note that the choice of the sign of n does not matter
since only even powers of n are present in R, S, and T .
For the same reason the ﬁelds contain no branch points
in the upper half-plane.

Despite poles in the upper half-plane, the ﬁelds are
relativistically causal. This fact can established using the
analyticity of the respective functions in the half-plane
Im ω > γ and their asymptotic behavior in that region.
For example, T tends to exp(iωd/c) as Im ω
, which
means that the signal-front delay through the slab is d/c.
The time-domain solutions are found by inverse
Laplace transforms of the associated ﬁelds. For example,
if the excitation at z = 0− is u(t) exp(
iω1t), where u(t)
is the unit step function and Im ω1 < 0, the time-domain
ﬁeld in the slab is

When S has no poles in the upper half-plane, γ can be set
to zero. It follows then that the ﬁeld S can be interpreted
at real frequencies. When S contains poles in the upper

half-plane, the integration path cannot be located at the
real frequency axis, and as a result, S looses its physical
signiﬁcance for real ω.

To facilitate the analysis and interpretation of active
media, it is useful to obtain the ﬁelds when the slab ﬁlls

For passive media, this choice is equivalent to the choice
in (5), or in the conventional deﬁnition of n based on
analyticity.

For active media, one could guess that (10) remains
valid, but it is not clear a priori how to choose n. The
imaginary parts of ǫ and µ may take both signs in the ﬁrst
quadrant, and it may not be possible to choose n as an
analytic function in the upper half-plane. Surprisingly, as
shown by the following example, taking the limit d

in (7) leads in general to unphysical results. Consider

. This will not alter (10), but will ensure
the validity of the associated time-domain solutions for
all times. The solution has now been found; however,
the evaluation of the ﬁelds (10) far away in the upper
half-plane is impractical. Fortunately, we can move the

line γ down towards the ﬁrst branch point of n or zero of
η + 1. If there are no such points in the closed upper half-
plane, we can even evaluate (10) at the real axis. Note
that although the original functions R and S from (7) are
not analytic in the upper half-plane, the terms (10) are
analytic provided η + 1 has no zeros and n is analytic.
Also note that in all cases, (10) is analytic in some region

We conclude that the Fresnel equations (10) retain
their form, but not always their interpretation for active

order zeros, or η + 1 has zeros in the upper half-plane,
(10) contain points of non-analyticity. The reﬂected and
transmitted ﬁelds (10) must then be evaluated along the
line Im ω = γ, where γ is larger than the maximum Im ω
of the points of non-analyticity. The sign of the refrac-
tive index is determined so that n

Since n (or k′

to a global sign. This global sign is easily identiﬁed from

the conventional Kramers-Kronig relations for n, as in-
tegrated and evaluated along the real frequency axis, are

iω1t),
where Im ω1 is only slightly smaller than γ, the time-
domain ﬁeld (9) gets the main contribution for ω close to
ω1. In other words, S is roughly the complex amplitude
of the exponentially increasing wave. The dependence
exp(inωz/c
iωt) means that the wave, which is expo-
nentially increasing with time, propagates in the positive
z-direction. (For this medium Re n > 0 in the ﬁrst quad-
rant of complex frequency.)

B. Excitation of a “backward” wave.

Consider the medium ǫ = (1 + f )2 and µ = 1, where
f is still given by (1). The associated susceptibilities
satisfy (2) and (3), so at least in principle, this medium is
realizable. The product ǫµ is zero-free in the upper half-
plane, and we can determine the refractive index such
that it is analytic in the upper half-plane. This gives
n = 1 + f and η = 1/(1 + f ). Note that η

seems to be a potential route to negative refractive index
at optical frequencies [5]. Not only the phase velocity but
also the Poynting vector point in the negative z-direction
at this frequency. Since Im n(ω1) > 0 and Im ǫ(ω1) < 0,
the ﬁeld near the boundary can be interpreted as a grow-
ing wave propagating in negative z-direction. Neverthe-
less, the excitation of this “backward” wave does neither
rely on ﬁniteness of the thickness of the active medium
nor excitation from z = +
. Note that any causal exci-
∞
tation involves an inﬁnite band of frequencies, and out-
side the limited negative-index band, the phase velocity
and Poynting vector point in the forward direction.

At oblique incidence the “backward” wave is refracted
negatively. Although this may seem obvious intuitively,
the fact can be proved by calculating k′
z and identifying
its sign along the real frequency axis using the proce-
dure outlined above. Despite negative refraction, the
medium has rather diﬀerent properties from the left-
handed negative-index medium considered by Veselago
and Pendry [6, 7]. Considering a ﬁnite slab of suﬃ-
ciently small thickness d, we ﬁnd T
exp(+iω1d/c)
at the frequency ω1. Also, evanescent-ﬁeld ampliﬁca-
tion, as in the Veselago-Pendry lens, will not arise in
this medium. For TE polarization this is seen by the

also write ǫ
iα for a small positive α. Indeed, it is
possible to tune the parameters in the two examples such
that the two ǫ’s (and µ’s) are identical at this frequency.
Nevertheless, the Fresnel equations (10) give completely
diﬀerent answers; in the previous example the “forward”
wave, with phase velocity and energy growth in the +z-
direction, is excited, whereas in the present example a
“backward” wave is excited. The dilemma is resolved
by noting that although the ǫ’s are identical for a single
frequency, they are not identical globally. As a result,
the causal excitation at z = 0−, which necessarily con-
tains an inﬁnite band of frequencies, will have diﬀerent
consequences in the two situations.

V. CONCLUSIONS

General forms of the Fresnel equations, valid for active
media, have been proved. When the refractive index con-
tains branch points in the upper half-plane, the Fresnel
equations and the refractive index cannot be interpreted
along the real frequency axis. Rather the expressions
should be evaluated or interpreted in some upper half-
γ, where the line Im ω = γ is above the

The sign of the refractive index of active (or passive)
media should be deﬁned using the asymptotic form of n
(n
), and analyticity for Im ω > γ. It
would have been useful to have an explicit relation for the
refractive index, similar to (5). However, for active media
such a relation is not valid as the complex arguments of
ǫ and µ may take any values. Nevertheless, since n is
continuous for Im ω
γ, the sign can be identiﬁed up to
a global sign by unwrapping the phase arg ǫ+arg µ before

using (5). The global sign is determined easily from the
asymptotic form of n as ω

Using the general framework, we have seen that in cer-
tain active media, only the “backward” propagating wave
is excited. For this wave both phase velocity and Poynt-
ing’s vector point towards the excitation source. These
media are conveniently described using a negative refrac-
tive index. Nevertheless, evanescent-ﬁeld ampliﬁcation,
similar to that in the Veselago-Pendry lens, does not ex-
ist.

Abstract. We demonstrate the possibility to stabilize the probabil-
ity amplitude of the upper level for a single quantum two-level atom
in a classical optical ﬁeld with feedback control scheme.

Key words : Two-level atom, optical ﬁeld, feedback control.

PACS : 42.50.-p, 02.30.Yy

1. Introduction

In this article we use the so-called ”semiclassical model” of the atom–
ﬁeld interaction that describes a single quantum two-level atomic system
(all other levels are neglected) with classical electromagnetic ﬁeld. We
use the standard notation following [1], but in our model the optical ﬁeld
plays the role of a control signal u(t) for closed-loop, or feedback, control
scheme in the form of speed-gradient (SG) method [2]. Recently other
authors studied the control of two-level atoms in the frame of open loop-
ideology when the controlling ﬁeld was known a priori. It allowed to get
the diﬀerent forms of atomic energy spectra, producing π- and π/2-pulses
[3], taking special non-constant shapes of external ﬁeld [4] etc.

The main feature of the model proposed here is that it is based on
the closed-loop approach. It means that we do not deﬁne initially the
dependency of the ﬁeld on time, but restore this function for every mo-
ment from the current values of the amplitude probabilities of the atomic
ground and excited levels.

For this purpose we use the real positive goal function Q, measuring
how far at the moment we are from the desired state of the atom. As
a result we calculate the control signal u(t), i.e. we restore the shape of
the electromagnetic ﬁled to populate the upper level of the atom.

In the second section of this work we construct the feedback control
model for the single two-level atom in external controlling optical ﬁeld.
Then, in the third section, we apply feedback speed gradient scheme to
the non-decay case.

2. Two-level atom in control optical field

Let’s consider the interaction of an optical ﬁeld E(t) linearly polarized

along the x-axis with a two-level atom.

Let |ai and |bi represent the upper and lower level states of the atom,
i.e., they are eigenstates of the unperturbed part of the Hamiltonian ˆH0
with the eigenvalues: ˆH0|ai = ~ωa|ai and ˆH0|bi = ~ωb|bi. The wave
function of a two-level atom can be written in the form

|ψ(t)i = Ca(t)|ai + Cb(t)|bi,

where Ca and Cb are the probability amplitudes of ﬁnding the atom in
states |ai and |bi, respectively. The corresponding Schr¨odinger equation
is:

˙ψ(t)i = −

with ˆH = ˆH0 + ˆH1, where ˆH0 and ˆH1 represent the unperturbed and
interaction parts of the Hamiltonian, respectively [1]:

ˆH0 = ~ωa|aiha| + ~ωb|bihb| ;
ˆH1 = −(cid:16)℘ab|aihb| + ℘ba|biha|(cid:17)E(t),

where ℘ab = ℘∗
ba = eha|x|bi is the matrix element of the electric dipole
moment. We neglected the decay of the levels. We express the electric
ﬁeld as

E(t) = E0u(t),

where E0 is the amplitude and u(t) is the control signal. The equations
of motion for the amplitudes Ca and Cb may be written as

˙Ca = −ιωaCa + ιΩRu(t)e−ιφCb,

˙Cb = −ιωbCb + ιΩRu(t)eιφCa,
where the ”Rabi frequency” is deﬁned as ΩR = |℘ba|E0/~, and φ is the
phase of the dipole matrix element ℘ba = |℘ba|eιφ.

To solve for Ca and Cb, let’s write the equations of motion for the

slowly varying amplitudes:

then

ca = Caeιωat

; cb = Cbeιωbt,

˙ca = ιΩRu(t)e−ιφcbeιωt ;
˙cb = ιΩRu(t)eιφcae−ιωt ,

where ω = ωa − ωb is the atomic transition frequency. The phase φ can
be excluded from the system. Really, if we put
cb = ιΩRu(t)e−ιwtca
˙
e

cb = cbe−ιφ:
e

Later for simplicity we will denote

cb with cb, then ﬁnally:
e

˙ca = ιΩRu(t)eιwtcb
˙cb = ιΩRu(t)e−ιwtca

Now let’s suppose that we have the initial conditions:

ca(0) = 0 ; cb(0) = 1
(3)
and our goal is to stabilize the atom system at the upper level: |ca|2 = 1.

3. Speed gradient method for probability
amplitude control

Still we did not specify the time-dependent function u(t). To ﬁnd it,
we apply the speed gradient (SG) method [2] to control the system’s
behavior. In this approach the control action is chosen in the maximum
decent direction for a scalar goal function. The goal in the control process
is a smooth scalar function Q with the limit relation

The purpose of the SG method is to minimize the goal function

where |ca|2 = cac∗
a. SG represents the control signal u with the time
derivative of the goal function ˙Q. In the case of proportional feedback
with some positive coeﬃcients Γ0, Γ1, it is deﬁned in the form:

lim
t→∞

Q(x(t), t) → 0.

Q =

1
2(cid:16)|ca|2 − 1(cid:17)

2

,

u = Γ0 − Γ1

∂ ˙Q
∂u

Thus

u(t) = Γ0 + ιΓ1ΩR(cid:16)|ca|2 − 1(cid:17)(cid:16)e−ιwtcac∗

b − eιwtcbc∗
a(cid:17)

Putting value of u(t) from Eq.(6) in Eqs.(1) and (2), we have the following
system of equations:

˙ca = ιΩRΓ0eιwtcb + Γ1Ω2

˙cb = ιΩRΓ0e−ιwtca + Γ1Ω2

R(cid:16)|ca|2 − 1(cid:17)(cid:16)e2ιwtc∗
ac2
b − ca|cb|2
(cid:17) ;
ac∗
R(cid:16)|ca|2 − 1(cid:17)(cid:16)cb|ca|2 − e−2ιwtc2

b(cid:17).

Now suppose that

ρa = cac∗

a = |ca|2 ; ρb = cbc∗
ιρ− = e−ιωtcac∗

ρ+ = e−ιωtcac∗

b − eιωtc∗

b = |cb|2 ;
acb

b + eιωtc∗

Hence we have the following four equations:

˙ρa = ΩRΓ0ρ− + 2Γ1Ω2

R(cid:16)ρa − 1(cid:17)h(cid:16)

+ − ρ2

(cid:17) − ρaρbi ;

(cid:17)i ;

˙ρb = −ΩRΓ0ρ− + 2Γ1Ω2

R(cid:16)ρa − 1(cid:17)hρaρb − (cid:16)

˙ρ+ = wρ− ;

˙ρ− = 2ΩR(cid:16)ρb − ρa(cid:17)hΓ0 − Γ1ΩR(cid:16)ρa − 1(cid:17)ρ−i − wρ+ .

Also from Eq.(6) the control signal u(t) becomes

u(t) = Γ0 − Γ1ΩR(cid:16)ρa − 1(cid:17)ρ−

With initial conditions ρa(0) = 0, ρb(0) = 1 we have

˙ρa + ˙ρb = 0 ,

(7)

(8)

that means in fact:

|ca(t)|2 + |cb(t)|2 = 1,
which is the simple statement that the probability to ﬁnd the atom in
one of its states |ai or |bi is 1. Thus, we can simplify the system (7),
putting ρb = 1 − ρa.

The system (7) has two stable points:

R + ω2 i, −
0Ω2

(ρa, ρ+, ρ−) = (cid:16)

From above we can easily get

ρb =

Thus, it is necessary to include the constant signal Γ0 into the SG scheme
(5) not to start the control procedure from the stable point. On the
Figs.2,3 we demonstrate the result of our control procedure for:

Γ0 = 0.01, Γ1 = 0.1, ΩR = 102 and ω = 103

.

On Fig.2 we show the solution of Eq.(7a).

4. Conclusion

The SG algorithm can be easy applied to establish feedback control for
the probability amplitudes of two-level atom. This scheme, nevertheless,
should be suﬃciently modiﬁed if we take into consideration the decay of
the atom levels, because in this case the goal (4) is not achievable for SG
algorithm in principle.

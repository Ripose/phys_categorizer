Abstract

We consider an anisotropic homogenized composite medium (HCM) arising from isotropic par-
ticulate component phases based on ellipsoidal geometries. For cubically nonlinear component
phases, the corresponding zeroth-order strong-permittivity-ﬂuctuation theory (SPFT) (which is
equivalent to the Bruggeman homogenization formalism) and second-order SPFT are established
and used to estimate the constitutive properties of the HCM. The relationship between the com-
ponent phase particulate geometry and the HCM constitutive properties is explored. Signiﬁcant
diﬀerences are highlighted between the estimates of the Bruggeman homogenization formalism and
the second-order SPFT estimates. The prospects for nonlinearity enhancement are investigated.

Introduction

The constitutive properties of a homogenized composite medium (HCM) are determined by both
the constitutive properties and the topological properties of its component phases [1]–[5]. In partic-
ular, component phases based on nonspherical particulate geometries may give rise to anisotropic
HCMs, despite the component phases themselves being isotropic with respect to their electromag-
netic properties. Such geometrically-derived anisotropy has been extensively characterized for linear
dielectric HCMs [6]–[8] and more general bianisotropic HCMs [8]–[10]. For weakly nonlinear HCMs,
the role of the component phase particulate geometry was emphasized recently in this journal by
Goncharenko, Popelnukh and Venger [11], using an approach founded on the mean-ﬁeld approxi-
mation. However, their analysis was restricted to the Maxwell Garnett homogenization formalism
[3, 12]. A more comprehensive study is communicated here based on the strong-permittivity-
ﬂuctuation theory (SPFT) [13]. In contrast to the aforementioned Maxwell Garnett approach [11],
the SPFT approach (i) incorporates higher-order statistics to describe the component phase dis-

tributions; (ii) is not restricted to only dilute composites; and (iii) is not restricted to only weakly
nonspherical particulate geometries.

The early development of the SPFT concerned wave propagation in continuous random medi-
ums [14, 15], but more recently the theory has been applied to the estimation of HCM constitutive
parameters [16, 17]. The SPFT represents a signiﬁcant advance over conventional homogenization
formalisms, such as the Maxwell Garnett approach and the Bruggeman approach [3, 6], through
incorporating a comprehensive description of the distributional statistics of the HCM component

diagrammatic technique to calculate iterative reﬁnements to the constitutive parameters of a com-
parison medium; successive iterates incorporate successively higher–order spatial correlation func-
tions. It transpires that the SPFT comparison medium is equivalent to the eﬀective medium of
the (symmetric) Bruggeman homogenization theory [20, 21]. In principle, correlation functions of
arbitrarily high order can be accommodated in the SPFT. However, the theory is most widely-
implemented at the level of the bilocal approximation (i.e., second-order approximation), wherein
a two-point covariance function and its associated correlation length L characterize the component
phase distributions. As indicated in ﬁgure 1, coherent interactions between pairs of scattering
centres within a region of linear dimensions L are incorporated in the bilocal SPFT; scattering
centres separated by distances much greater than L are assumed to act independently. Thereby,
the SPFT provides an estimation of coherent scattering losses, unlike the Maxwell Garnett and
Bruggeman homogenization formalisms. Notice that the bilocally–approximated SPFT gives rise
to the Bruggeman homogenization formalism in the limit L

0 [21].

The SPFT has been widely applied to linear homogenization scenarios, where generalizations2
have been developed for anisotropic dielectric [18, 19], isotropic chiral [20] and bianisotropic [21,
22] HCMs. Investigations of the trilocally-approximated SPFT for isotropic HCMs have recently
conﬁrmed the convergence of the second-order theory [17, 23, 24]. In the weakly nonlinear regime,
developments of the bilocally-approximated SPFT have been restricted to isotropic HCMs, based
on spherical component phase geometry [16, 17, 24]. The present study advances the nonlinear
SPFT through developing the theory for cubically nonlinear, anisotropic HCMs. Furthermore, it
is assumed that the component phases are composed of electrically-small ellipsoidal particles. The
relationship between the HCM constitutive parameters and the underlying particulate geometry of
the component phases is investigated via a representative numerical example.

where ˆr (θ, φ) is the radial unit vector speciﬁed by the spherical polar coordinates θ and φ. Thus,
a wide range of ellipsoidal particulate shapes, including highly elongated forms, can be accommo-
dated. The linear ellipsoidal dimensions, as determined by η, are assumed to be suﬃciently small

the Bruggeman formalism) is applicable for all volume fractions fa

4 Numerical results and discussion

Let us explore the HCM constitutive parameter space by means of a representative numerical
example: Consider the homogenization of a cubically nonlinear phase a with linear permittivity
10−4 esu) and a linear
ǫa0 = 2ǫ0 and nonlinear susceptibility χa = 9.07571
phase b with permittivity ǫb
ǫb0 = 12ǫ0. Note that the selected nonlinear susceptibility value
corresponds to that of gallium arsenide [25], while selected the linear permittivity values are typical
of a wide range of insulating crystals [32]. We assume the ellipsoidal component phase topology

The Bruggeman estimates of the HCM relative linear and nonlinear constitutive parameters
are plotted in ﬁgure 1 as functions of fa and Uz. The calculated constitutive parameters presented
in ﬁgure 1 are consistent with those calculated by Lakhtakia and Lakhtakia [31] in a study per-
taining to the Bruggeman homogenization of ellipsoidal inclusions with a host medium comprising
spherical particles. The linear parameters follow an approximately linear progression between their
constraining values at fa = 0 and fa = 1. Furthermore, for the range Uz
[0.5, 15], the linear
parameters are largely (but not completely) independent of the particulate geometry of the com-
ponent phases. This is in contrast to the nonlinear parameters which are acutely sensitive to Uz.
Of special signiﬁcance is the nonlinearity enhancement (i.e., the manifestation of a higher degree
of nonlinear susceptibility in the HCM than is present in its component phases) which is partic-
ularly observed at high values of Uz for χx
Br. This phenomenon
and its possible technological exploitation are described elsewhere [3, 16, 17, 24, 31, 33]. In order

The SPFT estimates of the HCM relative linear constitutive parameters ǫxr,yr,zr
and nonlinear con-
stitutive parameters χxr,yr,zr
are plotted in ﬁgures 2 and 3, respectively, as functions of fa and k0L.
Signiﬁcant diﬀerences are clear between the Bruggeman-estimated values and the SPFT-estimated
values: The SPFT estimates of linear constitutive parameters provide an additive correction to the
corresponding Bruggeman parameters, whereas for the nonlinear constitutive parameters the SPFT
estimates provide a subtractive correction to the corresponding Bruggeman parameters. Further-
more, the magnitudes of these diﬀerences exhibit local maxima which occur at progressively higher
values of fa as one compares the constitutive parameter components aligned with the x, y and z
coordinate axes, respectively. This trend holds for both the real and the imaginary parts of both
the linear permittivity and the nonlinear susceptibility parameters. However, it is less pronounced
for the nonlinear constitutive parameters.

Coherent interactions between scattering centres enclosed within a region of linear dimensions
L are accommodated in the bilocally-approximated SPFT via the two-point covariance function
(5) (see ﬁgure 1). Thus, since neither component phase a nor component phase b is dissipative, the
nonzero imaginary parts of the SPFT constititutive parameters in ﬁgures 2 and 3 are attributable
entirely to scattering losses. Furthermore, the magnitudes of the imaginary parts of the constitutive
parameters are observed in ﬁgures 2 and 3 to increase as L increases, due to the actions of greater
numbers of scattering centres becoming correlated.

5 Concluding remarks

The bilocally-approximated SPFT for weakly nonlinear isotropic HCMs, based on spherical partic-
ulate geometry, has been recently established [16, 17, 24]. In the present study we further advance
the theory through considering anisotropic, cubically nonlinear HCMs, arising from isotropic com-
ponent phases with ellipsoidal particulate geometries. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the bilocally-
approximated SPFT (i.e., second-order theory) and the Bruggeman homogenization formalism (i.e.,
zeroth-order theory) — which depend upon the underlying particulate geometry — have emerged.
In particular, nonlinearity enhancement is predicted to a lesser degree with the SPFT than with the
Bruggeman homogenization formalism. The importance of taking into account the distributional
statistics of the HCM component phases is thereby further emphasized.

The integrals (66) and (67) are straightforwardly evaluated by standard (e.g., Gaussian) nu-
merical methods [34]. In the degenerate isotropic case Ux = Uy = Uz, the integrals (66) and (67)
yield the analytic results of [17].

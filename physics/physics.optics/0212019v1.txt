Abstract

Deformations of liquid interfaces by optical radiation pressure are believed to be similar whatever

the propagation direction of the exciting laser beam is. If this remains true for moderate cw laser

illumination we experimentally evidenced a symmetry breaking at higher ﬁeld strength. We observe

either the formation of huge stable tethers or the break-up of the interface depending on possibility

of total reﬂection or not. In the case leading to interface disruption our experimental results are

compared with those obtained by Zhang and Chang for water droplets under intense laser pulses

[Opt. Lett. 13, 916 (1988)].

Since the seminal work of Ashkin and Dziedzic [1] on the deformation of transparent liquid

free-surfaces induced by laser waves the optical radiation pressure has been recognized as very

appealing to locally manipulate liquid interfaces. First developments exploited essentially

the interface bending for optical applications in adaptative lensing [2], formation of surface

relief holographic gratings [3] or control of morphology-dependent resonances [4]. Recently

radiation pressure eﬀects have received a renewal interest in emerging nano/bio-technologies

as a non-intrusive tool to probe microscopic surface properties of soft materials including cell

stretching [5] or membrane and interface viscoelasticity [6, 7]. Nevertheless the bending of a

ﬂuid interface by the optical radiation pressure is generally weak and all these experiments

were thus essentially limited to the investigation of the linear regime in deformation.

If now this regime is well understood and experimentally characterized [8] the analysis

of non-linear behaviors appearing at much larger laser illuminations is still at an early

stage. Impressive pictures of water droplets shape distortions were already presented ﬁfteen

years ago by Zhang and Chang [9]. In their experiments dissymmetric deformations at the

front and rear of the intercepted droplet were observed with eventual droplet disruption on

the exit face under higher illumination. Even if signiﬁcant success has been achieved in

the theoretical description of the weakly non-linear regime of deformation [10, 11], such a

scheme, based on linear wave theory, is clearly not suﬃcient to explain by itself the giant

dissymmetry observed. Moreover both deformations are strongly coupled because the lens

eﬀect associated to the droplet curvature at the entrance face artiﬁcially complicates the

In view of a better understanding of the mechanisms at the origin of the dissymmetry, as

well as the interface disruption, we choose in the present Letter to work with ﬂat interfaces.

Consequently using a laser beam coming either from one side or the other of the meniscus

we are able to independently analyze the deformations observed at the entrance or the exit

ﬁeld distribution.

of a drop [9].

Experiments are performed in a water-in-oil microemulsion (stable suspension of

surfactant-coated water nano-droplets, called micelles, dispersed in an oil-rich continuum).

Its composition and some of its characteristics have already been described previously [12].

For a temperature T > TC, where TC is a critical temperature, the mixture separates in two

micellar phases of diﬀerent concentrations. The main advantages of our medium are the ex-

tremely weak surface tension of the liquid meniscus separating the two phases (typically 106

2

times smaller than that of the water/air free surface) and its very low residual absorption at

the wavelength used. As a consequence interface deformations can easily be monitored by

continuous laser waves without disturbing thermal couplings or non-linear bulk eﬀects [12].

Moreover the vicinity of a critical point ensures the universality of the observed phenomena

[8].

The experimental set-up is shown in Fig.1. The mixture is enclosed in a thermoregulated

spectroscopic cell and the temperature is chosen above TC to reach the two-phase equilibrium

state. Since density (resp.

index of refraction) of water is larger (resp.

smaller) than

that of oil, the micellar phase Φ1 of larger concentration is located below the low micellar

concentration phase Φ2 while its refractive index n1 is smaller than n2 of Φ2. The bending of
the liquid-liquid meniscus is driven by a linearly polarized T EM00 cw Ar+ laser (wavelength

in vacuum, λ0 = 514 nm) propagating either upward or downward along the vertical axis.

The beam is focused on the interface by an objective lens (Leitz 10X, N.A. 0.25). In the
following P is the beam power and the beam-waist ω0 at 1

e2 is adjusted by changing the

distance between a ﬁrst lens L (focal length f=1 m) and the focusing objective.

Typical interface deformations induced for identical experimental conditions (T

TC =

−

3 K and ω0 = 5.3µm) are presented on Fig. 2 for upward and downward exciting beams.

Since n1 < n2 radiation pressure acts downwards toward the less refractive medium, regard-

less to the propagation direction of the laser. Fig. 3 resumes the variation of the height

h(r = 0) versus beam power P in both cases. As expected and already observed in experi-

ments [8] h(r = 0) is linear in P at low beam power. This regime corresponds respectively

to P

225 mW and P

300 mW in the two examples presented. Then h(r = 0) deviates

≤

≤

from linearity with further increase in P . The deformation switches from the classical bell

shape to a stable tether shape in the upward case (see the last four pictures on Fig. 2a)).

The behavior is radically diﬀerent in the downward excitation case. The deformation sud-

denly looses stability and h(r = 0) diverges above a well-deﬁned onset power PS (see for

instance the two last pictures at P = PS = 400 mW on Fig. 2b)). This instability gives

birth to a liquid jet that self-traps the beam and emits droplets at its end (Fig. 2c).

Reasons for this symmetry breaking can be recovered from very simple physical argu-

ments. In fact as the beam propagates from the large to the low refractive phase in the

downward case total reﬂection of light at the interface can be reached. When it occurs this

phenomenon leads to a dramatic concentration of the light energy towards the tip of the

3

bulge which consequently becomes unstable. It can even be demonstrated that the condi-

tion of total reﬂection precisely deﬁned an onset in power PS for the instability, in complete

accordance with experimental results [13]. We validate the following scaling relation for the

instability onset:

where σ is the meniscus surface tension and c the light velocity in vacuum. Considering the

200 mJ laser pulse experiment of Zhang and Chang [9] the fountain of liquid emerging from

the front face of the droplet can be explained by the instability mechanism underlined here.

Moreover as said before Eq. (1) remains valid to predict the instability onset for a water/air

interface (σ

70 mN/m at room temperature). We ﬁnd PS(water/air) = 2.9 104 W

≃

for ω0 = 100 µm. Both 100 mJ and 200 mJ laser pulses used in the above mentioned

experiments overshoot this limit. They correspond respectively to P = 1.25 105 W and

2.5 105 W [11], whereas jet formation only appears for the highest value. Nevertheless

discrepancies between the given pulses parameters and theoretical simulations have already

been reported [10, 11].

For the opposite direction of propagation the huge induced tethers (up to 60 µm on Fig.

2a)) are surprising as well. A coupling still exists between the laser propagation and the

deformation because this last one acts as a soft lens for the beam [12]. However in that case

the beam is focused inside the deformation and no ampliﬁcation mechanism occurs therefore

for the intensity experienced by the tip of the bulge. These unusual nonlinear shapes deserve

further theoretical investigations. A ﬁrst step consists in taking into account the variation

of the radiation pressure with the incidence angle of the laser on the deformed interface, a

point which is generally neglected because the bending of classical liquid interfaces is weak.

The surface pressure Πn caused by one single reﬂection/refraction is given by the generic

formula [14]:

Πn =

where α and β are the angles of incidence and refraction for a vertical incident ray, I is the

incident intensity and R and T are the coeﬃcients of reﬂection and transmission in energy.

Irrespective of ray direction, Πn acts downwards, normally to the surface.

Now, it is possible to make a rough estimate of the dissymmetry in radiation force in both

cases, without dealing with the complex shape of the deformation. Consider the following

4

simple model. Replace the deformation with a symmetrical two-dimensional wedge, with

an opening angle (π

2α) facing upwards. Assume that an incident vertical ray in the

−

downward direction falls towards the wedge surface with an angle α corresponding to total
reﬂection (sin α = n1

n2 ). In this case R = 1, T = 0 and n = n2. We calculate the vertical
force coming from Πn over a length l of the surface (l reckoned from the cusp) and deﬁne
a mean vertical pressure ¯Πz(

showing that the present crude model is able to predict a signiﬁcantly higher radiation

pressure when the beam is directed downwards. It is therefore physically understandable

that strong-ﬁeld eﬀects appear when light is incident from the optically denser medium.

As a conclusion we demonstrate that radiation pressure eﬀects on liquid interfaces are

intrinsically dissymmetric as soon as curvature eﬀects are considered. At higher beam exci-

tations the observed and predicted instability onset is in qualitative agreement with previous

experiments. Finally, the resulting ﬁlament provides also a appealing example of self-written

liquid waveguide.

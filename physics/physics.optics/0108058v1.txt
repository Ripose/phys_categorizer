(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We present the design of a diﬀraction limited, long working distance monochromatic objective
lens for eﬃcient light collection. Consisting of four spherical lenses, it has a numerical aperture of
0.29, an eﬀective focal length of 36 mm and a working distance of 36.5 mm. This inexpensive system

allows us to detect 8 · 10
ﬂuorescence photons per second from a single cesium atom stored in a
magneto-optical trap.

INTRODUCTION

The optical detection of individual trapped particles,
such as single ions in a Paul trap [1] or neutral atoms
in a magneto-optical trap [2], necessitate the develop-
ment of eﬃcient imaging optics. The ability to collect
low levels of ﬂuorescence light and the imaging of small
objects require a high numerical aperture and diﬀraction
limited performance, respectively. Additionally a long
working distance is often necessary to provide access for
laser beams or mechanical structures to the trap region.
Commercially available solutions for this application
are either long working distance microscope objectives,
which are relatively expensive, molded aspheric lenses
with usually short focal lengths, or achromats, which
have larger spot sizes. Special experimental geometries,
such as imaging through the window of a vacuum cell,
or speciﬁc geometrical restrictions, often require custom
solutions.

II. LENS DESIGN

Our experimental requirement is the eﬃcient collec-
tion of ﬂuorescence light from single atoms in a magneto-
optical trap (MOT) [3], see Fig. 1. The trap is located

inside a vacuum cell, which itself is situated between two
magnetic coils. This results in the following typical re-
quirements for an objective used for single atom experi-
ments:

1. Collimation of the radiation of a point source at a
wavelength of 852 nm with a large numerical aper-
ture (NA). Once the light is collimated it can easily
be imaged with low NA optics.

2. A minimum working distance of 36 mm. This is
determined by our laser setup because laser beams
reﬂected oﬀ the glass cell must not enter the ob-
jective. Moreover, the experimental geometry does
not permit any optical elements inside the vacuum
cell.

3. Near diﬀraction limited spot size on axis, to enable
high resolution imaging and spatial ﬁltering of the
ﬂuorescence light.

4. A ﬁeld of view covering the MOT position uncer-

tainty of about 1 mm.

5. Imaging through a plane silica window of 5 mm
thickness, which introduces spherical aberrations
for a NA>0.2.

6. Limitation of the outer diameter of the assembled
lens system to 30 mm by the magnetic coils of the
MOT, see Fig. 1.

To keep the design reasonably simple and cheap, we
restricted ourselves to spherical surfaces and BK7 glass
only, and we used standard catalog lenses whenever pos-
sible.

Single spherical lenses exhibit a reduction of their reso-
lution above a NA of about 0.1 due to their predominant
spherical aberration. The main idea of a multi-lens sys-
tem is therefore to compensate for the aberrations of one
surface with the aberrations of other ones. In our case,
positive spherical aberration from convex surfaces is the
primary disturbance to eliminate. It needs to be balanced
by negative spherical aberrations of concave surfaces.

The objective is designed using the program Oslo
LT [4]. It traces a parallel input beam of ﬁxed diameter
through the lens elements and the 5 mm silica window.

During the optimization the radius of curvature of the
last surface of the last lens is controlled to keep the NA
and eﬀective focal length ﬁxed. The program is set up
to minimize the squared sum of the spherical aberrations
up to 7th order and third order coma and astigmatism.
The radii of curvature and the lens distances are used as
variables, and the programs optimization routine is iter-
ated. Diﬀerent starting conﬁgurations are used in search
for a global optimum.

Acceptable performance could not be achieved with
three lenses, with four lenses, however, good designs were
possible. The radii of curvature of the lens surfaces were
subsequently ﬁxed to catalog values of our vendor [5],
each time reoptimizing the remaining variables. The re-
sulting design is shown in Table I and Fig. 2. It consists
of three standard lenses and one meniscus lens with cat-
alog radii of curvature [6].

The design has a wavefront aberration of λ/1000 rms
on axis, resulting in a diﬀraction limited spot size of
1.8 µm (airy disc radius). Provided that the curvature
of the image surface is taken into account, the wavefront
error at a distance of 0.5 mm oﬀ axis is λ/13 rms. 1 mm
oﬀ axis the spot size radius increases to 3 µm rms.

Note that the performance of the objective is by no
means limited to the special requirements of our experi-
mental setup. Changing the distance between surfaces 2
and 3 in Fig. 2 from 8.2 mm to 6.6 mm (and refocusing)
allows the system to work even without the 5 mm silica

window, with negligible performance degradation. Adap-
tion to any window thickness up to 10 mm is possible.

Although the design is optimized for 852 nm it re-
tains its diﬀraction limited performance from 1064 nm
to 400 nm when the chromatic focus shift is taken into
account.

III. ASSEMBLY AND EXPERIMENTAL TESTS

All lenses have a diameter of 1”, a surface quality (over
90 % of the clear aperture) of λ/4, scratch-dig 20-10,
centration < 5 minutes of arc and AR-coating for 650-
1000 nm. They are stacked into an aluminum tube of 1”
inner and 30 mm outer diameter and held in place by a
threaded retainer ring. The distances between the lenses
are determined by thin aluminum spacer rings. The me-
chanical parts have been manufactured to a tolerance of
0.1 mm.

An experimental test of the wave front aberration was
performed by focusing an 852 nm laser beam onto a 1 µm
diameter pinhole serving as a high NA point source. The
transmitted light was collimated by the objective under
test and analyzed by means of a shear plate interferom-
eter [7]. From the bending of the resulting interference
fringes (Fig. 3) we estimate a wavefront distortion of less
than λ/4 peak-valley over 90 % of the clear aperture.

In our MOT setup (Fig. 1) the optical axis of the ob-
jective was carefully aligned onto the trap center using
a Helium-Neon laser beam. The collimated ﬂuorescence
light from the MOT is focused by an f=80 mm doublet
lens through a pinhole of 150 µm diameter for spatial ﬁl-
tering (stray light suppression). The transmitted light is
imaged onto an avalanche photodiode operated in sin-
gle photon counting mode, with a quantum eﬃciency
η ≈ 50 % at 852 nm. When the MOT lasers are sat-
urating the atom, we detect about 8 · 104 ﬂuorescence
photons per second from one cesium atom on a stray
light background of only 2.2 · 104 photons per second.
Since with a NA of 0.29 we cover Ω/(4π) = 2.1 % of the
total solid angle, and the lifetime of the excited state is
τ =30.5 ns, the theoretical upper limit for the count rate
of a strongly saturated two level atom is

Due to the more complex situation of a cesium atom in
the MOT [8] the discussion of which is beyond the scope
of this paper the expected value is signiﬁcantly below the
upper limit.

and mechanical parts is about US $ 500 only. A sim-
ilarly inexpensive system could be advantageously used
for high resolution imaging of single ions or atoms or for
heterodyne detection of ﬂuorescence radiation. This sys-
tem recently managed to detect single atoms in an optical
dipole trap for the ﬁrst time [9].

Abstract

We explore the physical mechanism of Brewster’s angle in the external and internal reﬂections

associated with an anisotropic material. The anisotropic material is both dielectric and magnetic,

and includes metamaterials. We obtain Fresnel’s coeﬃcients and the condition of Brewster’s angle

by the extinction theorem. The Brewster’s angle is found to occur if the total contribution of

the electric and magnetic dipoles in the anisotropic material to the reﬂection ﬁeld becomes zero.

Distinct from isotropic media, the anisotropic material can exhibit Brewster angle for both TE and

TM waves due to the anisotropy of the material.

INTRODUCTION

As well known, Brewster’s angle is the angle of incidence at which the incident light

is reﬂected without the polarization component parallel to the plane of incidence. At the

Brewster’s angle, the reﬂected light is perpendicular to the refracted light. The physics

accounting for such a phenomenon is that the vibration of electrons in the second medium

can not generate the reﬂected light which travels perpendicular to the transmitted light

[1]. These conclusions are only valid for dielectric materials. Since conventional transparent

materials can be regarded nonmagnetic, these conclusions are applicable to them.

However, the advent of a new kind of artiﬁcial materials, named as left-handed materials,

changes the situation. The left-handed material was hypothesized by Veselago [2] and can

exhibit many exotic electromagnetic properties, in which the most well known is the neg-

ative refraction. Since the negative refraction was experimentally observed in a structured

metamaterial composed of arrays of conducting split ring resonators (SRRs) and wires [3],

the left-handed material has attracted much attention and interest [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

Metamaterials have been explored to exhibit Brewster’s angle not only for TM (traverse

magnetic) waves, but also for TE (traverse electric) waves [12, 13]. Then, one enquires nat-

urally: How on earth do TE waves exhibit Brewster angle in metamaterials? Whether the

mechanism of Brewster angle for TE waves is the same with that for TM, i.e., just described

above?

It is accepted that the molecular optics theory can give much deeper physical insight into

the interaction of electromagnetic wave with material than do Maxwell theory [14, 15, 16, 17].

But such an approach is less frequently employed because it involves integral-diﬀerential

equations diﬃcult to be solved. Recently, Lai et al [18] used the method of superposition of

retarded ﬁeld to discuss the reﬂection and refraction law of electromagnetic wave incident

on an isotropic medium. Along that way, Fu et al [19] explored the Brewster condition for

light incident from the vacuum onto an isotropic material with negative index. Since the

metamaterials are actually anisotropic, it is necessary to generalize the Brewster condition

from the isotropic material to the anisotropic material. At the same time, in most work

dealing with the interaction of electromagnetic wave with material by the molecular optics

theory, often considered is the wave incident from the vacuum into a dielectric material

[14, 16, 20], but the case of wave incident from the vacuum on a magnetic material, or from

a material into into vacuum is rarely investigated.

2

In the present paper, it is our purpose to present a detailed investigation on the mecha-

nism of Brewster angle for wave in external and internal reﬂections associated with a both

dielectric and magnetic anisotropic material. We use the extinction theorem to explore the

reﬂection characteristics and discuss the Brewster angle from the molecular optics view-

point. We ﬁnd the mechanism for Brewster’s angle is that the contributions of the electric

and magnetic dipoles to the reﬂected ﬁeld add up to zero. The results extend the conclusions

about Brewster’s angle in isotropic materials [16, 17, 18, 19] and provide a deeper look on

those obtained by Maxwell theory [21].

This paper is organized as follows.

In Sec.

II, we derive the expression of Fresnel’s

coeﬃcients in the external reﬂection of plane waves incident on an anisotropic material by

the extinction theorem. Then we give the Brewster’s angle condition and discuss the results.

In Sec. III, we obtain the internal reﬂection coeﬃcients of waves incident from the material

into vacuum, and then derive the existence condition of Brewster angle. The results are

summarized in Sec. IV. Throughout the paper SI units are used.

II. EXTERNAL REFLECTION

In molecular optics theory, a bulk material can be regarded as a collection of molecules

(or atoms) embedded in the vacuum. Under the action of an external ﬁeld, the molecules

oscillate as electric and magnetic dipoles and emit radiations. The radiation ﬁeld and the

external ﬁeld interact to form the new transmitted ﬁeld in the material and the reﬂection

ﬁeld outside the material [1].

In this section, we derive the expression of Fresnel’s coeﬃcients in the external reﬂection of

waves incident on a homogeneous, linear, lossless, anisotropic material by the Ewald-Oseen

theorem. Then we give the Brewster’s angle condition and discuss the results.

Following the extinction theorem, the incident ﬁeld is extinguished inside the material

kix = ktx. This is the Snell’s law: ki sin θi = kt sin θt.

quantitatively which part of the radiation ﬁeld of dipoles extinguish the incident ﬁeld.

In addition, there can exist a critical angle of incidence θC =

from the electric and magnetic dipoles form the reﬂected ﬁeld. Applying Eqs. (8) and (9)

respectively. In fact, we replace µ in Eq. (14) with ε and can obtain Eq. (18) immediately

considering the interchangeability of E in Eqs (2) and (3) and H in Eqs (5) and (4).

Obviously, Eqs. (14) and (18) are in agreement with the results obtained by the formal

approach of Maxwell’s equations. By now, we can see that the extinction theorem plays the

role of the boundary conditions in Maxwell approach.

Alternatively the Brewster angle and conditions, i.e., Eqs. (20), (21), (23) and (24), can

be obtained from the reﬂection coeﬃcients in Eqs. (14) and (18). The Brewster angle and

conditions are in agreement with those obtained from Maxwell’s theory in Ref. [21].

We ﬁnd that Brewster condition of TE waves is only related to three components of the

material parameters ε and µ, while that of TM waves is connected with the other three

components. Therefore, we can let the anisotropic material exhibit Brewster angles for TE,

or TM, or both waves through choosing appropriate ε and µ. We give an example in Fig. 3.

To explain the Brewster condition vividly, we illustrate in Fig. 4 the magnitude of radiation

and reﬂection ﬁelds of the examples in Fig. 3. In Fig. 4 we can see clearly that when the

radiation of electric and magnetic dipoles is zero, i.e., Ee

r0 + Em

r0=0, the Brewster angle

appears. This result is in agreement with that in Fig. 3. It can also be found that across

the Brewster angle the phase of reﬂection ﬁeld changes.

In the following we discuss Brewster angles for TE and TM waves from the view point of

molecular optics.

(2). TM waves. We can discuss Brewster angle of TM waves and come to conclusions

similar to those about the Brewster angle of TE waves, simply interchanging µ0 and ε0, µ

and ε, respectively. In addition, we give the following discussions.

It is clear from Eq. (22) that if εx

= εz, then kr is not perpendicular to kt. That is where

the Brewster angle in reﬂection on anisotropic material is diﬀerent from that on isotropic

material. This is due to the anisotropy of the material, as described by Zhou et al [12].

However, if µy = µ0 (He

r0 = 0), εx = εz and kr

r0 = 0), then Hr0 = 0. Hence, kr is
always perpendicular to kt at the Brewster angle. Further, we can write the Brewster angle
as the well-known form θB = tan−1 (n′/n), where n = √ε0µ0 and n′ = √εµ are the indices

kt (Hm

of refraction of the vacuum and the isotropic material, respectively. That is how TM waves

exhibit Brewster angle in reﬂection on isotropic nonmagnetic material. And the explanation

at the beginning of the paper is practically that Hr0 = 0.

(3). Consider the isotropic limit. It can be shown that Eqs. (19) and (22) can not be

satisﬁed simultaneously for one isotropic material. That is to say, one kind of isotropic

material only can exhibit Brewster angle for either TE waves or TM waves, but not both.

(4). Another important point should be noted. When rE = 0 or Er0 = 0, it can be proved

that Hr0 = 0. This is easily understood as that if Hr0 6
ﬁeld, resulting in Er0 6
simultaneously at the Brewster angle. This is why the textbooks explain the Brewster angle

= 0. Hence the reﬂected electric and magnetic ﬁelds must vanish

= 0, it would produce new electric

for TM waves (Hr0 = 0) in isotropic nonmagnetic material as that the vibration of electrons

in the second medium can not generate the reﬂected electric ﬁeld (Er0 = 0) which travels

perpendicular to the transmitted light [1].

In conclusion, the condition of Brewster angle for TE (TM) waves is that the electric and

magnetic ﬁelds of reﬂection excited by the electric and magnetic dipoles in the anisotropic

10

material are zero simultaneously, i.e., Ee

r0 + Em

r0 = 0 and He

r0 + Hm

r0 = 0.

III.

INTERNAL REFLECTION

From the above section, we know that when a beam is incident from vacuum onto an

anisotropic material, the radiation of the electric and magnetic dipoles in the material form

the reﬂection wave in the vacuum. When the radiation ﬁeld of dipoles is zero, the Brewster

angle occurs. Now, consider a diﬀerent situation:

light impinges from the material into

vacuum, where the Brewster angle has been proved to exist [12, 13]. One may wonder why

the Brewster angle can exist here since there does not exist any dipoles in the vacuum? In

the following, we answer this question, i.e., the Brewster angle in internal reﬂection.

A.

Internal reﬂection

Consider a plane wave with E1 = E10eik1·r−iωt and H1 = H10eik1·r−iωt incident from an
anisotropic material into the vacuum, where k1 = k1xˆx + k1zˆz. Assume the reﬂected ﬁeld
is Er = Er0eikr·r−iωt with Hr = Hr0eikr·r−iωt and the transmitted ﬁeld is Et = Et0eikt·r−iωt
with Ht = Ht0eikt·r−iωt, where kr = krxˆx
krzˆz and kt = ktxˆx + ktzˆz. Here, however, the
−
polarization P and the magnetization M are related to the incident ﬁeld as P = ε0χe

E1,
i = ε0µ0ω2. It

Evidently Eq. (28) denotes a vacuum plane wave with wave vector k0 and can be regarded

being incident from the vacuum into the material. Then, the vacuum wave will be reﬂected

on the interface and be transmitted into the material. Using the conclusions obtained

in Sec. II, we calculate the reﬂection wave as Erad.r = REin
Erad.t = T Ein

rad where R and T is the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients for wave incident
from vacuum into the anisotropic material. The transmitted wave Erad.t is the ﬁnal reﬂection

rad and the transmitted wave

wave Er0,

and kt = ki. For TE wave, using the dispersion relation of the material the reﬂection

coeﬃcient RE = Er0/E10 is readily evaluated

The reﬂection ﬁeld Erad.r and the radiation ﬁeld Eout

rad in the vacuum add up to the real

transmitted wave

Therefore, the transmission coeﬃcient TE = Et0/E10 is obtained as

Vacuum

FIG. 5: Schematic diagram for how the reﬂection and refraction ﬁelds are formed by the radiation

ﬁeld and the incident ﬁeld for TE waves incident from an anisotropic material into vacuum. The

process is distinct from those in external reﬂection as in Fig. 2. Under the action of the incident

ﬁeld E1, the dipoles produce an internal radiated ﬁeld Ein

rad in the material and an external one

Eout

rad in the vacuum. The internal radiated ﬁeld Ein

rad can be regarded an incident wave from the

vacuum into the material. It produces a reﬂected wave Ein

rad.r in the vacuum and a transmitted

wave Ein

rad.t in the material. The magnitude of the real reﬂected ﬁeld is Er0 = Ein

rad.t = T Ein

When Ein

rad = 0, Er0 = 0 and Brewster’s angle occurs.

B. Brewster’s angle

In the following, we discuss the Brewster angle in internal reﬂection.

In order to satisfy rE =

Er0/E10|

|

2 = 0, it requires Ein

rad = 0 in Eq. (30). Equation (28)

is similar to Eq. (13), then similar conclusions can be obtained to those of Brewster angle

for external reﬂection in the subsection B of Sec. II after replacing kiz and ktz with ktz and

k1z, respectively. Thus the conditions for Brewster angle in internal reﬂection are identical

to that of external reﬂection. The Brewster angle of internal reﬂection can be obtained by

Snell’s law sin θB = kt sin θt/k1, where θt is equal to the Brewster angle of external reﬂection.

Therefore, we know that if the condition

material exhibit Brewster angles both for TE and TM waves. Since the existence condition

of Brewster angle in internal reﬂection is the same with that in external reﬂection, we can

discuss and come to conclusions about the internal reﬂection similar to external reﬂection.

In a word, if the total contribution of the electric and magnetic dipoles to the reﬂected

ﬁeld is zero in the material, Brewster angle occurs in internal reﬂection. Compared to that

in external reﬂection, the existence condition of Brewster angle in internal reﬂection is the

same and the Brewster angle is just the refraction angle of external reﬂection at the incidence

of external Brewster angle. This point is consistent with the reversibility of light ray.

IV. CONCLUSION

In summary, we have used the extinction theorem to generalize the conclusions about

the Brewster’s angle in the isotropic dielectric material to the anisotropic dielectric and

magnetic material. We investigated the Brewster angle not only in external reﬂection, but

also in internal reﬂection. We ﬁnd the mechanism for Brewster eﬀect in external reﬂection

is that the total contribution of the electric and magnetic dipoles in the anisotropic material

to the reﬂection ﬁelds in the vacuum is zero. For internal reﬂection, the Brewster eﬀect is

because the total contribution of the dipoles in the anisotropic material to the reﬂection

ﬁelds in the material is zero. Interesting, the requirements on the material parameters ε

and µ for Brewster’s angle in internal reﬂection is the same as those in external reﬂection,

but the corresponding Brewster angle is just the refracted angle of external reﬂection at the

incidence of external Brewster angle. According to the Brewster angle condition, through

14

choosing appropriate ε and µ the anisotropic material can exhibit Brewster angles for TE

waves, or TM waves, or both. Moreover, the Brewster eﬀect can happen to TE and TM

waves simultaneously and the omnidirectional total transmission will occur, which may lead

to important applications in practice. This can not happen to an isotropic material and can

be explained as anisotropic materials have more freedom than isotropic media to exhibit

Brewster’s angle. In other words, it is due to the anisotropy of the materials [12].

Although based on molecular optics theory, these conclusions are applicable to metama-

terials consisting of SRRs and wires. That is because both the SRR and the wire dimensions

are much smaller than the wavelength of interest [3]. Then the unit cells of SRR and wire

can be modelled as the molecules (or atoms) in ordinary materials. Actually, Belov et al have

used the Ewald-Oseen’s extinction theorem to investigate the boundary problem of meta-

materials [22]. In addition, the generality of the results in the present paper may provide

references in manufacturing materials in experiments for speciﬁc purposes, such as making

polarization devices.

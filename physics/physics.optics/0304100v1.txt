Quantum Vacuum Contribution to the Momentum of the

Dielectric Media.

Abstract

Electro-Optics Division, Soreq NRC, Yavne 81800, Israel

Momentum transfer between matter and electromagnetic ﬁeld is analyzed. The related equations

of motion and conservation laws are derived using relativistic formalism. Their correspondence to

various, at ﬁrst sight self-contradicting, experimental data (the so called Abraham-Minkowski con-

troversy) is demonstrated. A new, Casimir like, quantum phenomenon is predicted: contribution

of vacuum ﬂuctuations to the motion of dielectric liquids in crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

Velocities about 50nm/s can be expected due to the contribution of high frequency vacuum modes.

Electromagnetic radiation possesses energy, linear and angular momenta like any ordi-

nary material object. As a consequence the light can exert mechanical forces on matter

during the interaction. The forces associated with exchange of the linear and the angular

momenta of light with material bodies were successfully measured already hundred years

ago[1][2][3]. However, the fundamental question of the momentum associated with a photon

in an optically dense medium is still under discussion[4], despite that it was formulated in

the beginning of the previous century. This problem arises from the discrepancy between
Minkowski’s[5] GM = 1

ference is signiﬁcant: while Minkowski’s moment is directly proportional to the refractive

index of the medium, the moment of Abraham possess inverse proportionality.

Minkowski momentum is considered by many as unacceptable, although it was shown by

Jones, Richards and Leslie (JRL) that the recoil force of the light on a mirror immersed in

liquid is directly proportional to the refractive index of the liquid[7]. This experiment was

conducted twice with a 20 years period[8]. However most of the theoretical works are in

favor of Abraham’s expression (for a review, see refs. [9][10]).

Abraham’s momentum can be derived from the Poynting energy ﬂow vector S = c

under assumption that all energy is purely electromagnetic and relates to the mass through
the U = mc2 relativistic formula. It corresponds to the relativistic requirement for direct

proportionality of the energy and momentum ﬂows (the symmetry of the electromagnetic

stress tensor)[11]. Abraham’s result is also supported by statistical physics approaches[12].

However, as far as we know, there are no experimental data that demonstrate the inverse

dependence of the radiation pressure on the refractive index. This, at least, allows to

conclude that the measured momentum is not purely electromagnetic.

The eﬀective momentum of a photon in a dielectric medium consists of electromagnetic

momentum and associated motion or even radiation of matter[9]. However separate identi-

ﬁcation of diﬀerent parts proved itself to be non-trivial and sometimes led to contradictions

with experimental data[8]. Blount[13] and Nelson[14] developed a Lagrangian formalism of

the problem, using heuristic and microscopic averaging approaches correspondingly. They

signiﬁcantly clariﬁed the picture by associating Abraham’s expression with electromagnetic

momentum and Minkowski’s momentum with phonon like pseudomomentum. Still several

questions remained open, especially a small discrepancy of Abraham’s momentum with the

2

expression derived in refs. [14][15].

In this Letter the related Lagrangian and corresponding equations of motion are derived

using relativistic formalism. In the case of liquid dielectric, interaction of the electromagnetic

ﬁeld with matter causes motion of the latter. Thus while Abraham’s expression is indeed the

momentum of the ﬁeld, the measured momentum also includes the matter contribution and

its value coincides with Minkowski’s result. Afterwards the possible vacuum contributions

to the motion of the matter are considered. Each electromagnetic mode possesses ﬁnite

momentum, even in its ground state[16]. Thus modiﬁcation of the modes by matter can alter

the momentum of the vacuum. The latter generally vanishes due to counter propagating

modes that cancel each other’s contribution. This situation can be diﬀerent however in

materials that are temporally and spatially asymmetric.

The electromagnetic ﬁeld in an optically dense medium is described by the Maxwell

equations:

B = 0.

The free electric E and magnetic B ﬁelds exist both inside and outside the matter. The

matter response to the radiation is taken into account through derived ﬁelds D and H,

related to E and B by the dispersion relations. In the case of linear, non-dispersive dielectric

medium they are given by:

D = εE, H =

B,

1
µ

where ε and µ are the dielectric and magnetic constants of the matter correspondingly.

The Lagrangian approach simpliﬁes the investigation of light-matter interaction. The

simplicity comes from the universality that allows to use the same approach to the system

consisting of signiﬁcantly diﬀerent subsystems and the natural to the Lagrangian approach

deﬁnition of the conservation laws. The Lagrangian which is equivalent to eqs. (1) and (2)

is[17][18]:

The motion of the matter and especially its inﬂuence on the electromagnetic ﬁeld must

be taken into account in a combined matter-ﬁeld Lagrangian LM F . The linear dispersion

Since the liquid is assumed to be incompressible, it is described by its density ρ and local

velocity v only. The equations of motion (4) of (9) are identical to the Maxwell equations

with dispersion relations (6). The last term of (9) can be rewritten in an interaction Aj

form, where the current j is given by

(E

1) /µc. The latter, at least for the

non-magnetic µ = 1 case, can be obtained by microscopic averaging procedures[14][11].

The Lagrangian (9) is explicitly independent of the space coordinates x, due to the

homogeneity of space. Thus according to Noether theorem, the momentum[18]:

Therefore the conserved linear (11) and angular (12) momenta consist of the matter and

the Abraham’s ﬁeld terms. The correspondence between the conserved and the measured

momenta follows from the analysis of the Lorentz force acting on material objects[11].

The ρv term can be obtained from the liquid’s equation of motion:

This expression corresponds qualitatively to the pseudomomentum of ref. [14]. Substituting

the case of beams with speciﬁc wavefront distortions, e.g. Laguerre-Gaussian beams[21]. In

contrast to the linear momentum, the spin part of the nearly plane wave is independent of

dielectric properties of the medium. This was veriﬁed experimentally for microwave radiation

The dielectric constant dependent angular momentum was observed inside a cylindrical

capacitor ﬁlled with dielectric[23]. A cylindrical capacitor was suspended on torsional levers

inside some external magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the axis of the cylinder. By applying voltage

to the capacitor’s walls a radial electric ﬁeld was created. These independent ﬁelds possessed

non-vanishing angular momentum, which was compensated by the motion of the capacitor

itself. The observed[25] x

Ashkin and Dziedzic observed that the liquid interface bends outwards the liquid in both

cases when light enters and leaves the liquid[26]. Contrary to their measurement, the con-

servation law (11) predicts inward bending. Loudon recently arrived to the same conclusion

by quantum analysis of the Lorentz force[4]. The results of ref. [26] were explained by the

inﬂuence of ponderomotive forces[27], caused by strong focusing of the light in this exper-

iment. These forces, also used for optical tweezers, are much stronger than contributions

from the change of the radiation momentum on the boundary.

5

Radiation forces can be caused even by redistribution of the energy between quantum

vacuum and matter. Attraction of two parallel metal plates in vacuum was predicted by

Casimir[28] and experimentally observed by Lamoreaux[29]. Electromagnetic ﬁeld possesses

ﬁnite energy even in the ground state, similar to the quantum harmonic oscillator. The

presence of dielectric or metallic objects in space alternates the eigenstates of the electro-

magnetic ﬁeld. The energy of such system depends on the speciﬁc arrangement of the objects

and some rearrangement can be energetically favorable. Between two metal plates the low

frequency electromagnetic modes are cut oﬀ by the boundary conditions. The smaller the

separation the smaller is the eﬀective energy of the system, consequently the plates attract

each other. However, in Casimir case, no momentum is gained by the plate’s center of the

mass according to symmetry considerations. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the

transfer of ﬁnite momentum from vacuum modes to matter was not considered yet.

The zero ﬂuctuations contribution to the equation of motion (14) can be expected, since

the moment of electromagnetic ﬁeld, similar to its energy, is a quadratic function of E and B.

Vacuum contribution can not occur, neither in time even media nor in spatially symmetrical

time-odd (Faraday) materials, due to the self compensation of counterpropagating modes.

Therefore both time and spatial asymmetries are required.

The break of both spatial and time symmetries occur naturally in magnetoelectric

materials[30],[31]. The dispersion relations for magnetoelectrics are:

This expression is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the Casimir eﬀect, since it is powered by the

This eﬀect (22) can be evaluated quantitatively by the estimation of the value of ∆n from

the known experimental data. In crossed external magnetic Bext and electric Eext ﬁelds, ∆n

[37] results into (23). The experimental measurement of

(22) requires eﬀective homogeneity of the matter. Otherwise eqs. (14) and (20) are not

valid. Thus the region of the crossed ﬁelds must be produced locally, similar to the laser

beam in JRL experiment. It can be done for instance by immersing a capacitor’s electrodes

inside the liquid.

Any liquid possess viscosity, causing decay in time of any artiﬁcially created ﬂow. The

dissipation processes can be taken into account empirically by adding correspondent viscous

forces η∆v to the equation of motion (13):

while (14) deﬁnes the boundary conditions. According to (14), the Gaussian laser beam in

JRL experiment generated Gaussian ﬂow. Eq. (24), in such case, becomes an ordinary diﬀu-

sion equation. The initially gained momentum of the liquid ”diﬀuses” in a plane perpendicu-

timescale observations can separate the electromagnetic and liquid ﬂow contributions to the

measured force, because the measured momentum (11), in the case of static liquid, corre-

sponds to Abraham’s momentum. It is also feasible in an experiments with strong overlap

between incident and reﬂected beams, e.g. measurement in a tube. The motion of matter

can not occur under symmetric illumination, thus the measured force must be independent

of the liquid’s refractive index.

In conclusion relativistic formalism was applied for light-matter Lagrangian derivation.

Equations of motion were obtained and their correspondence to the Abraham-Minkowski

controversy related experimental data was demonstrated. The received results correspond

to Abraham’s predictions, while Minkowski’s momentum can be obtained from (9) without

its last ”motion of the matter” term. Therefore the origin of the controversy lies in the

underestimation of the fact that the ﬁeld-matter interaction is impossible without the motion
of the latter. The vacuum ﬂuctuations induced ﬂow in dielectric liquids with vvac ≈
was predicted in external crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The signiﬁcant property of

50nm/s

this phenomenon is the high frequency vacuum modes contribution, similar to the Lamb shift

eﬀect. It can be used in future as an investigating tool for zero ﬂuctuations. Other possible

applications lie in ﬁelds of microﬂuidics or precise positioning of microobjects, e.g. cold

atoms or molecules. Initial experimental veriﬁcations can be based on artiﬁcially created

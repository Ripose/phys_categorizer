We report polarization tomography experiments on metallic nanohole arrays with square and
hexagonal symmetry. As a main result, we ﬁnd that a fully polarized input beam is partly depo-
larized after transmission through a nanohole array. This loss of polarization coherence is found
it depends on the polarization state of the input beam. The depolarization
to be anisotropic, i.e.
is ascribed to a combination of two factors:
i) the nonlocal response of the array due to surface
plasmon propagation, ii) the non-plane wave nature of a practical input beam.

Currently, there is much interest in the optical prop-
erties of thin metal ﬁlms perforated with arrays of sub-
wavelength holes, or nanohole arrays. The optical trans-
mission of these arrays shows a strongly peaked spec-
trum with anomalously large transmission peak values;
this is usually ascribed to resonant excitation of propa-
gating surface electromagnetic waves or surface plasmons
(SPs)[1, 2], which exist due to the fact that the real part
of the dielectric function of a metal is smaller than -1 for
frequencies below the plasma frequency[3]. There is no
restriction on the imaginary part, however. Indeed, sim-
ilar anomalous transmission spectra have recently been
observed in scaled versions of a metal hole array in the
(sub)millimeter-wave domain, where the dielectric func-
tion of a metal is dominantly imaginary, but long-range
SPs still exist[4, 5, 6]. This suggests that the propa-
gating nature of the SP is the key to understanding the
anomalous transmission. In this Letter we focus on the
polarization properties of the anomalous transmission,
and show that these, too, are strongly inﬂuenced by the
propagating nature of the SPs .

So far, polarization properties of nanohole arrays have
been studied in a limited context: a beam with a given
uniform state of polarization (SOPin) is transformed,
by an anisotropic array, in a diﬀerent uniform state of
output polarization (SOPout) [7, 8]. This corresponds
to a unitary mapping on the Poincar´e sphere; for in-
stance, a rectangular array or a square array with el-
liptical holes acts as a birefringent and/or dichroic ele-
ment, which may convert a linear SOP into an elliptical
SOP, conserving polarization coherence. This is not what
we deal with in the present Letter; instead we focus on
cases where the degree of polarization (DOP) is reduced,
DOPout < DOPin[9, 10]. To underline this point, we
have chosen for our experiments square and hexagonal

arrays, i.e. arrays that, for symmetry reasons[11], can-
not modify the SOP for plane-wave illumination at nor-
mal incidence. As we will show, depolarization occurs
when two (quite common) conditions are fulﬁlled: (i) the
response of the array is nonlocal due to SP propagation,
and (ii) the input beam is not a plane wave (but e.g. a
Gaussian beam, with a ﬁnite numerical aperture (NA)).
In general, depolarization occurs when an optical sys-
tem acts non-uniformly on polarization within the (spa-
tial or temporal) bandwidth of the incident wave, thereby
coupling polarization to other degrees of freedom. The
two most widely used formalisms to describe the polar-
ization properties of a linear optical system are due to
Jones and Mueller. In both cases, the input and output
SOPs are represented by column vectors, which are con-
nected by either a 2 × 2 Jones matrix or a 4 × 4 Mueller
matrix[9, 10], describing the action of the optical sys-
tem. The Jones formalism is applicable only to situations
in which the light is temporally coherent and spatially-
uniform polarized. The Mueller formalism deals with the
Stokes parameters, which represent (spatial or time) av-
erages of the polarization properties of the light, and as
such, is also capable of handling partially polarized and
incoherent waves. Experimentally, a study of depolar-
ization requires therefore a measurement of the Mueller
matrix by a tomographic method[10]. We report here
such polarization tomography experiments on nanohole
arrays and interpret the results in the context of SP prop-
agation.

We start by recapitulating the essence of our theoret-
ical model [11]. The input and output optical ﬁelds of
the array are related via a non-local linear response as
~Eout(~r, ω) =
t(~r − ~r′, ω) ~Ein(~r′, ω) d~r′. In the far-ﬁeld,
or Fourier domain, this is equivalent to ~Eout( ~kt, ω) =
t( ~kt, ω) ~Ein( ~kt, ω), where ~kt is the transverse wavevec-

FIG. 1: Experimental setup to measure the Mueller matrix
of nanohole arrays. The incident polarization state is set by
a quarter-wave plate (QWP) or half-wave plate (HWP), the
output polarization state is measured with a combination of
a QWP, polarizer (POL) and photodiode (PD). Lenses L or
L’ form a symmetric telescope, at the focus of which the hole
array is placed; a variable aperture A sets the numerical aper-
ture of the illumination.

tor component; the output ~kt is equal to the input ~kt
for the zeroth-order transmission.
If the non-local re-
sponse depends on polarization, the elements of the 2 × 2
transmission tensor t( ~kt, ω) exhibit a diﬀerent angular
dependence and the output ﬁeld ~Eout( ~kt, ω) can have a
spatially-dependent polarization even for a polarization-
pure input ﬁeld. This necessitates a Stokes vector de-
scription, which considers only spatially-integrated in-
tensities. The four components of the Stokes vector
are S0 = I0◦ + I90◦ = I45◦ + I135◦ = Iσ+ + Iσ−, and
S1 = I0◦ − I90◦ , S2 = I45◦ − I135◦ and S3 = Iσ+ − Iσ−,
with Ii the intensity of the polarization component de-
noted by the subscript i[10]. After spatial integration,
the transmission process can be captured in a simple re-
lation Sout = M Sin, which relates the input and output
Stokes vectors through the 4 × 4 Mueller matrix M . For
ideal square and hexagonal arrays the Mueller matrix
has been predicted to be diagonal (no mixing of Stokes
parameters)[11]. For hexagonal arrays, the additional
symmetry relation M11 = M22 holds.

The magnitudes of the diagonal elements M00, M11,
M22 and M33 depend on the product of the SP propaga-
tion length and the wave vector spread of the input beam,
ℓSP ∆kt. A full theoretical description thereof would re-
quire a microscopic model; however, from physical con-
siderations it can be seen that an appreciable deviation of
Mii/M00 from 1 requires ℓSP ∆kt >∼ 1. In any case, there
will be no depolarization if either there are no propagat-
ing waves (ℓSP = 0) or there is plane-wave illumination
(∆kt = 0); both propagation and wave vector spread are
necessary.

Figure 1 shows the experimental setup used to mea-
sure the Mueller matrices. A linearly polarized Titanium-
Sapphire laser at a wavelength of 810 nm, being the ap-
proximate resonance wavelength of the hole arrays (cf.
Fig. 2), illuminates the input lens (L or L′) of a symmet-
ric telescope. After transmission through a hole array,
positioned at the focus of the telescope, the light is im-
aged onto a photodiode. The SOP of the incident light
is set by a rotatable quarter-wave or half-wave plate in
front of the ﬁrst lens. The Stokes parameters at the out-

put are measured with a rotatable quarter-wave plate and
polarizer positioned in front of the photodiode.

We have characterized the arrays with two types of il-
lumination. Almost plane-wave illumination, with a nu-
merical aperture of NA = 0.01 (∆kt ≈ 0.08µm−1), was
provided by focussing the 1 mm diameter laser beam with
a lens L of f = 50 mm. Focussed illumination (up to
NA ≈ 0.15 or ∆kt ≈ 1.2µm−1) was obtained by focussing
the laser beam on a 10 µm diameter mode-cleaning pin-
hole (not shown) to homogeneously illuminate a lens L′
(f=15 mm at 40 cm from the pinhole) through a variable
aperture A. The polarization isotropy of all optical com-
ponents was checked by measuring the Mueller matrices
of both setups in the absence of hole arrays. These ma-
trices were practically equal to the identity matrix, with
individual elements deviating by not more than 0.02 (typ-
ically 0.008).

Our arrays were fabricated in Au ﬁlms on glass sub-
strates. We used a square array made with electron-beam
lithography, identical to the one used in Ref. [13], with
a lattice spacing of 700 nm and a nominal hole diameter
of 200 nm, and a hexagonal array made with ion-beam
milling, with a lattice spacing of 886 nm and a nominal
hole diameter of 200 nm. SEM pictures and transmission
spectra of both arrays under almost plane-wave illumina-
tion at normal incidence are shown in Fig. 2. Both arrays
show a resonance wavelength of 810 nm, which is marked
by a dashed vertical line; the polarization experiments

were performed at this wavelength. The resonances at
810 nm correspond to SPs propagating in the (±1, ±1)
direction at the metal-glass interface for the square ar-
ray, and the (six-fold degenerate) (1, 0, 0) direction at
the metal-air interface for the hexagonal array (the la-
beling is with respect to the reciprocal lattice vectors).
The linewidths are 40 nm and 25 nm, for square and
hexagonal arrays, respectively, from which we estimate
ℓSP ≈ 2µm and ℓSP ≈ 4µm, respectively[12].

Figure 3 shows the dependence of the diagonal ele-
ments of the Mueller matrix on the NA of the incident
light for both arrays (the plotted elements M11, M22
and M33 are normalized with respect to M00). The ﬁg-
ure shows that, for the case of almost plane-wave illu-
mination (NA ≈ 0), the Mii values are close to 1 for
both arrays. There is no depolarization, as ∆kt ≈ 0.
However, for increasing wavevector spread, or decreasing
spot size on the array, the depolarizing eﬀect of the ar-
rays quickly increases. Furthermore, the depolarization
is clearly anisotropic, i.e. the amount of depolarization
depends on the input SOP. For the hexagonal array the
depolarization sets in faster upon increasing NA than for
the square array, due to its smaller resonance linewidth.
The eﬀect of the diﬀerent array symmetries on the
curve shapes are prominent.
For the square array
(Fig. 3a), the observed inequality M22 > M11 shows
that there is less depolarization for an input polariza-
tion along either of the array diagonals than for a polar-
ization along the main axes. This observation is consis-
tent with the (±1, ±1) propagation directions of the res-
onantly excited SPs on the metal-glass interface; as SPs
are mainly longitudinally polarized, they preserve polar-
ization along their propagation direction. However, the
deviation of M22 from 1 indicates that the (±1, ±1) SPs
are not the only SPs involved in the transmission pro-
cess; other (non-resonant) SPs on both surfaces appar-
ently contribute[12]. For the hexagonal array (Fig. 3b)
the theoretical equality M11 = M22 also holds quite well.
For both arrays, M33 is the smallest diagonal element.
This shows that depolarization is most dramatic for cir-
cularly polarized light, a case that has not been studied
before. We note that M33 ≈ M11 + M22 − 1 for both ar-
rays, as follows from an extension of the symmetry-based
theory used here by explicit modelling of SP propagation;
this will be discussed elsewhere[14].

The full Mueller matrices for both arrays are shown in
the Table. They were measured with nearly plane-wave
illumination (NA = 0.01 or ℓSP ∆kt ≈ 0.2 − 0.3 ≪ 1),
and with illumination at NA = 0.15 (ℓSP ∆kt ≈ 2) for the
square and NA = 0.10 (ℓSP ∆kt ≈ 3) for the hexagonal ar-
ray (indicated by the dashed vertical lines in Fig. 3). The
diagonal elements (marked with boxes in the Table) con-
form to the discussion given above. The oﬀ-diagonal ele-
ments of a perfectly symmetric square or hexagonal array
should theoretically be zero. For our square array they
are indeed relatively small and do not show any system-

atic behavior. For the hexagonal array however, these el-
ements are much larger both for plane-wave and focussed
illumination; this array apparently does not have perfect
hexagonal symmetry. Furthermore, the oﬀ-diagonal el-
ements have a clear pattern and similar values in both
cases, where the “odd” oﬀ-diagonal elements M02, M20,
M13 and M31 (underlined in the Table) are substantially
larger than the others. This pattern was checked to be
present also for an intermediate NA of 0.03. The pattern
is compatible with a birefringent/dichroic 45◦ axis, which
is apparently due to array errors, such as a spatially vari-
ant lattice spacing or ellipticity of the holes. These errors
could be created by alignment errors or even intrinsic
imperfections in the ion beam optics (astigmatism and
deﬂection errors).

From a general perspective, Mueller tomography can
give new insight into the physical mechanisms active in
hole arrays. It would be interesting to do Mueller tomog-
raphy on metal hole arrays in the (sub)millimeter-wave
regime, as SPs propagate much farther in this part of
the spectrum, which is expected to increase the depolar-
ization. Another area of interest is the connection be-

tween classical polarization properties and entanglement
degradation[13, 14]. Our work also shows that polar-
ization tomography provides for sensitive diagnostics of
array symmetry imperfections.

Finally, one may wonder whether depolarization in op-
tics is reversible or irreversible. In principle, depolariza-
tion is reversible, as it is always due to some form of aver-
aging over spatial (or temporal) degrees of freedom[15];
there is no inﬁnite bath that acts as an “information
sink”. In the present experiment, “repolarization” would
require an element that modiﬁes the array output po-
larization in a spatially-dependent way; such an element
could in principle be constructed based upon a spatial
light modulator[16], provided that it has a suﬃcient num-
ber of degrees of freedom (pixels) available. So, in the
end, the diﬀerence between reversibility and irreversibil-
ity is not absolute but gradual; it depends on the number
of degrees of freedom that can be managed in a practical
case (The same statement holds of course in statistical
mechanics).

In conclusion, we have demonstrated surprising con-
sequences of SP propagation for the polarization behav-
ior of nanohole arrays. The non-locality of the array
response forms an essential ingredient of the physics of
these intriguing devices.

We study dynamical reshaping of polychromatic beams due to collective nonlin-
ear self-action of multiple-frequency components in periodic photonic lattices
and predict the formation of polychromatic discrete solitons facilitated by lo-
calization of light in spectral gaps. We show that the self-trapping eﬃciency
and structure of emerging polychromatic gap solitons depends on the spectrum
of input beams due to the lattice-enhanced dispersion, including the eﬀect of
crossover from localization to diﬀraction in media with defocusing nonlinearity.

The fundamental physics of periodic photonic struc-
tures is governed by the wave scattering from periodic
modulations of the refractive index and subsequent wave
interference. Such a resonant process is sensitive to a
variation of the beam frequency and propagation angle1.
Accordingly, refraction and diﬀraction of optical beams
may depend strongly on the optical wavelength, allow-
ing for construction of superprisms that realize a spatial
separation of the frequency components.

In this Letter we address an important question of how
the periodicity-enhanced sensitivity of diﬀraction upon
wavelength inﬂuences nonlinear self-action of polychro-
matic light. We show that interaction between multiple-
frequency components of an optical beam can lead to
a collective self-trapping eﬀect and polychromatic soli-
tons, where spatial diﬀraction is suppressed simultane-
ously in a broad spectral region. These solitons can exist
in periodic structures with noninstantaneous nonlinear
response, such as optically-induced lattices2,3,4 or waveg-
uide arrays5,6 in photorefractive materials. We demon-
strate that the spectrum of polychromatic solitons pos-
sesses a number of distinctive features, related to the
structure of the photonic bandgap spectrum. This sug-
gests the possibility to perform nonlinear probing and
characterization of the bandgap spectrum in the fre-
quency domain, extending the recently demonstrated
approach for nonlinear Bloch-wave spectroscopy with
monochromatic light7.

We study the dynamics of polychromatic light in pla-
nar nonlinear photonic structures with a modulation of
the refractive index along the transverse spatial dimen-
sion, such as optically-induced lattices2,3,4 or periodic
waveguide arrays5,6. Then, the evolution of polychro-
matic beams in media with slow nonlinearity can be de-
scribed by a set of normalized nonlinear equations,

is the total intensity, N is the number of components, n0
is the average refractive index, ν(x) is the refractive in-
dex modulation in the transverse spatial dimension, and
γ is the nonlinear coeﬃcient. We consider the case of a
Kerr-type medium response, where the induced change
of the refractive index is proportional to the light inten-
sity and neglect higher-order nonlinear eﬀects such as
saturation, in order to clearly identify the fundamental
phenomena independent on particular nonlinearity. We
note that Eq. (1) with λn = λ describe one-color multi-
gap solitons8,9,10,11.

Linear dynamics of optical beams propagating in a pe-
riodic photonic lattice is deﬁned through the properties
of extended eigenmodes called Bloch waves1. We con-
sider an example of lattice with cos2 refractive index
modulation [see Fig. 1(a)] with the period d = 10µm,
and calculate dependencies between the longitudinal (β,
along z) and transverse (k, along x) wave-numbers for
Bloch waves, see Figs. 1(b-d). The top spectral gap is
semi-inﬁnite (extends to large β), and it appears due
to the eﬀect of the total internal reﬂection. The eﬀec-
tive diﬀraction of Bloch waves becomes anomalous at
the upper edges of Bragg-reﬂection gaps, where Deﬀ =
−∂2β/∂k2 < 0.

It is known that the presence of Bragg-reﬂection gaps
and associated anomalous diﬀraction regions allows for
the formation of monochromatic spatial gap solitons even
in media with self-defocusing nonlinearity3,6,12. Results
in Figs. 1(b-d) show that the spatial bandgap spectrum
depends on the optical wavelength and, in particular,
we ﬁnd that the anomalous diﬀraction regime is strongly
frequency dependent as Deﬀ ∼ λ3 at large wavelengths,
whereas the bulk diﬀraction coeﬃcient is proportional to
λ. Accordingly, the Bragg-reﬂection gap becomes much
narrower at larger wavelengths, limiting the maximum
degree of spatial localization that is inversely propor-
tional to the gap width.

The variation of the gap width can have a dramatic

eﬀect on self-action of an input Gaussian beam focused
at a single site of a defocusing nonlinear lattice6, where
a sharp crossover from self-trapping to defocusing oc-
curs as the gap becomes narrower. We note that, most
remarkably, these distinct phenomena can be observed
in the same photonic structure but for diﬀerent wave-
length components. In our numerical simulations, we put
γ = −10−4 and choose the lattice parameters such that
the critical wavelength corresponding to the crossover
is around 591nm. We conﬁrm that the monochromatic
beam with λ = 443nm experiences strong self-trapping,
whereas the largest fraction of input beam power be-
comes delocalized at a shorter wavelength λ = 665nm.
We then address a key question of how an interplay be-
tween these opposite eﬀects changes the nonlinear prop-
agation of polychromatic beams.

We model the self-action of polychromatic light beams
by simulating the propagation of nine components with
the wavelengths ranging between 443nm and 665nm. The
input corresponds to a narrow Gaussian beam that has
the width of one lattice site, i.e.
in our case 5µm. Fig-
ure 2 shows our numerical results for the propagation of
polychromatic light over 70mm. The spectrum of the
light at the input is ‘white’, i.e. the light beams of dif-
ferent wavelength all have the same input proﬁle and
intensity.
In the linear regime (small input intensity),
all components of the beam strongly diﬀract, and the
beam broadens signiﬁcantly at the output, as shown in

Fig. 2(a). As the input power is increased, we ﬁnd that
the spatial spreading can be compensated in a broad
spectral region by self-defocusing nonlinearity. We ob-
serve a spatially localized total intensity proﬁle at the
output, indicating the formation of a polychromatic gap
soliton [Fig. 2(b)].

We note that the spatial localization of the soliton com-
ponents strongly depends on the wavelength [Figs. 2(d)],
so that the long wavelength component has a much larger
spatial extent than the short wavelength component.
Hence, the soliton has a blue center and red tails, and
this eﬀect is more pronounced than for solitons with the
same spectra in bulk media. Additionally, the power

spectrum of the soliton becomes blue-shifted at the out-
put. Figure 2(c) shows the so-called ‘self-trapping eﬃ-
ciency’, which we deﬁne here as the percentage of light
that remains in the three central waveguides of the op-
tical lattice after the propagation for each wavelength.
This value essentially is identical to the trapped frac-
tion of light, as even for longer propagation distances the
light would remain localized in these waveguides. We see
that more that 40% of the light with the wavelengths
between 443nm and 484nm is trapped, whereas for the
longer wavelengths that percentage drastically decreases
due to the narrowing of the Bragg-reﬂection gap. How-
ever, due to the nonlinear interaction between the dif-
ferent wavelengths, there still is a noticeable amount of
light from the red side of the spectrum that is trapped
(roughly 8% of the light at 591nm). This is in a sharp
contrast to the case of monochromatic red light propaga-
tion, where the self-trapping eﬃciency vanishes.

We now study the eﬀect of input frequency spectrum
on the nonlinear self-action of polychromatic light. We
perform numerical simulations for the same proﬁles of
the input beam as in Fig. 2(b), but considering diﬀerent
power distribution between the frequency components.
Figures 3(a-d) show the characteristic propagation re-
sults for beams with blue- and red-shifted input spectra.
For the blue-shifted input spectrum [Figs. 3(a,b)], we

3

observe self-trapping of the polychromatic light beam,
and a small percentage of the red light is trapped by the
nonlinear index change caused by the blue parts of the
spectrum. In fact, the self-trapping eﬃciency for the red
part of the spectrum is almost identical to the case of a
white spectrum shown in Fig. 2(c). Fundamentally diﬀer-
ent behavior is observed for a polychromatic beam with
red-shifted spectrum [Figs. 3(c,d)]. In this case, the beam
strongly diﬀracts and self-trapping does not occur even
when the total input intensity is increased several times
compared to the case of white spectrum. This happens
due to the tendency of red components to experience en-
hanced diﬀraction as the eﬀect of defocusing nonlinearity
is increased at higher intensities. We note that, accord-
ing to Fig. 3(c), the blue part of the spectrum is also
diﬀracting.

In conclusion, we have studied the propagation of poly-
chromatic light and the formation of polychromatic soli-
tons in periodic photonic lattices, and demonstrated that
light self-action can be used to reshape multiple fre-
quency components of propagating beams in media with
noninstantaneous nonlinear response, such as photore-
fractive materials or liquid crystals. We have demon-
strated that self-trapping eﬃciency and structure of
emerging polychromatic gap solitons depends strongly on
the spectrum of input beams due to the lattice-enhanced
dispersion, and identiﬁed the eﬀect of crossover between
localization and diﬀraction in defocusing media.

Excitons in hexagonal nanonetwork materials

Abstract

Optical excitations in hexagonal nanonetwork materials, for example, Boron-Nitride (BN) sheets and nanotubes,
are investigated theoretically. A permanent electric dipole moment, whose direction is from the B site to the N
site, is considered along the BN bond. When the exciton hopping integral is restricted to the nearest neighbors, the
ﬂat band of the exciton appears at the lowest energy. The symmetry of this exciton band is optically forbidden,
indicating that the excitons relaxed to this band will show quite long lifetime which will cause luminescence
properties.

1. Introduction

The hexagonal nanonetwork materials com-
posed of atoms with ionic characters, for example,
Boron-Nitride (BN) sheets and nanotubes [1], have
been investigated intensively. They are intrinsi-
cally insulators with the energy gap ∆ of about
4 eV as the preceding band calculations have in-
dicated [2,3]. The possible photogalvanic eﬀects
depending on the chiralities of BN nanotubes have
been proposed by the model calculation [4].

In this paper, we investigate optical excitation
properties in BN systems. There is a permanent
electric dipole moment along the BN bond, which

will give rise to strong excitonic properties as illus-
trated in Fig. 1. Low energy optical excitations are
the excitations of the electron-hole pairs between
the higher occupied states of N and the lower un-
occupied states of B atoms.

2. Excitons on the Kagom´e lattice

We consider exciton interactions among near-
est neighbor dipoles. In Fig. 2 (a), the B and N
atoms are represented by full and open circles, re-
spectively. We assume one orbital Hubbard model
with the hopping integral of electrons t, the onsite
repulsion U , and the energy diﬀerence ∆ between
the B and N sites. After second order perturba-
tions, we obtain the following forms of the nearest
neighbor interactions: J1 = t2/(
∆ + U ) for the
case of conserved excited spin (type-1 interaction)
and J2 = t2/∆ + t2/(
∆ + U ) for the case that
spin of the excited electron ﬂips (type-2 interac-
tion). The condition U > ∆ means that J1 and
J2 are positive. The interactions are present along
the thin lines of Fig. 2 (a). After the extraction of
the interactions J1 and J2, there remains the two-
dimensional Kagom´e lattice which is shown in Fig.
2 (b). Therefore, the optical excitation hamiltonian
becomes:

usual in Fig. 2, and b = √3a is the unit cell length
of the Kagom´e lattice in Fig. 2 (b), and a is the
bond length of Fig. 2 (a). There appears a disper-
sionless band (triplet state) with the lowest energy
2(J1 + J2). There is another dispersionless band

(singlet state) at the higher energy 2(
J1 + J2).
Such the appearance of the ﬂat band has been dis-
cussed with the possibility of ferromagnetism in
the literatures [5]. In the present case, the lowest
optical excitation band becomes ﬂat in the honey-
comb BN plane. When the BN plane is rolled up
into nanotubes, the ﬂat band is dispersionless too.
The ﬂat exciton band will have strong optical den-

We look at symmetries of the lowest excitons
with the energy
2(J1 + J2) and the wavenum-
ber k = (0, 0). The symmetries of the twofold de-
generate solutions are shown in Fig. 3. Both wave-
functions have the symmetry gerade. The transi-
tion to the lowest exciton is optically forbidden,
which indicates that excitons relaxed to this lowest
exciton band will show quite long lifetime which
will cause luminescence properties. In addition, the
lowest energy excitons will have huge density of
state due to the ﬂatness of the band. These prop-
erties might result in interesting optical measure-
ments in hexagonal nanonetwork materials.

3. Summary

The ﬂat band of the optically forbidden exci-
ton appears at the lowest energy in the optical ex-
citations of BN systems. The excitons relaxed to
this band might show quite long lifetime which will
cause luminescence properties.

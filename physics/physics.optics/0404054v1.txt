Blind dispersion compensation for optical coherence tomography

We propose a numerical method for compensating dispersion effects in optical coherence tomography that
does not require a priori knowledge of dispersive properties of the sample. The method is based on the gen-
eralized autoconvolution function, and its principle of operation can be intuitively visualized using the Wigner
distribution function formalism.

Since its inception about two decades ago,[1] optical co-
herence tomography (OCT) has evolved into an increasingly
effective and promising imaging tool, particularly in biolog-
ical and biomedical applications.[2] The depth resolution of
OCT is proportional to the spectral bandwidth of the light
source as long as optical dispersion of the medium can be
neglected. However, for increasingly broadband sources em-
ployed to achieve ultrahigh axial resolution[3] dispersion be-
comes relevant, broadening the coherence length of the mea-
sured signal and thus leading to the loss of resolution.

Generally, two strategies have been developed to combat
dispersion effects in OCT. The ﬁrst one consists in matching
experimentally the amount of dispersion in both the arms of
the interferometer either with a simple introduction of an ap-
propriate compensation plate in the reference arm,[4] or by a
skilful design of the scanning arrangement for the reference
beam.[5, 6] The second strategy is to postprocess numeri-
cally complete fringe-resolved interferograms to compensate
for the dispersion-induced loss of resolution.[7, 8, 9] The nu-
merical approach requires usually a priori knowledge of the
dispersive properties of the medium which enter as the param-
eters of the compensation algorithm.

In this paper we propose a numerical method for recon-
structing dispersion-compensated depth proﬁles that does not
involve knowledge of the exact dispersive characteristics of
the medium. This method utilizes the phase information con-
tained in complete complex interferograms to remove delete-
rious effects of dispersion. As we discuss later, it is equiv-
alent to the recently demonstrated quantum OCT[10, 11]
which uses dispersion-cancellation effect in two-photon in-
terference. Our method offers all the advantages of quantum
OCT, but avoids the need for non-classical light sources. The
dispersion compensation is performed by postprocessing data
collected in a standard OCT setup with a low-coherence light
using a simple and straightforward in implementation numer-
ical algorithm.

Before passing on to the detailed discussion of the method,
we will present its principle of operation using a simple exam-
ple. The input for our method is the complex envelope Γ(τ ) of
the full analytical mutual coherence function,[7, 8, 9] param-
eterized with the delay of the reference beam. The dispersion-
compensated depth proﬁle is obtained by calculating the gen-
eralized autoconvolution of Γ(τ ), deﬁned as:

The parameter w, not related directly to the dispersion charac-
teristics of the medium, is used to tune the performance of the
method, and it will be typically much smaller than the light
bandwidth.

The autoconvolution function deﬁned above can reveal the
axial structure of a sample with a better resolution than the
interferogram itself. We illustrate this with Fig. 1(a,b), where
we present a reconstruction of an exemplary depth proﬁle for
a pair of reﬂective surfaces embedded in a dispersive material
and illuminated with a broadband light. First, let us consider
the scenario when no attempt to compensate for dispersion ef-
fects has been made. Fig. 1(a) shows the absolute value of
the envelope
which is the most basic way to retrieve
the depth proﬁle. This proﬁle is severely broadened by dis-
persion. For comparison we also plot in this graph a proﬁle
that would be obtained for a narrower bandwidth of the probe
for this speciﬁc
light, giving the optimal resolution of
medium. These two plots should be contrasted with Fig. 1(b)
which shows the autoconvolution function calculated accord-
ing to Eq. (1) for several values of the parameter w. It is seen
that the autoconvolution function reveals the location of the
reﬂective surfaces as two sharp peaks with a resolution com-
parable to the coherence length of the probe light itself. Addi-
tionally, the convolution function contains a spurious artefact
located half-way between the peaks. Its presence is a result of
numerical interference of signals reﬂected by the two surfaces,
but its magnitude can be quickly suppressed by increasing the
value of the parameter w. The suppression is accompanied by
a slight broadening of the genuine peaks in the depth proﬁle,
which is however signiﬁcantly less severe than that affecting
.

Let us now discuss in detail properties of the autoconvolu-
tion function Ξw(τ ) as a tool for reconstructing depth proﬁles.
We consider a standard OCT setup in which broadband light,
characterized by the power spectrum S(ω) centered around
a frequency ω0, is split into two beams. One, signal beam
is reﬂected off the sample, thus acquiring in the spectral do-
main the response function of the sample ̺(ω), whereas the
second reference beam undergoes a controlled temporal delay
2τ . Interference between these two beams yields the mutual
coherence function, given by:

we will see reveal positions of the reﬂective surfaces, and then
the cross-terms Ξ(mn)

for the artefacts in the reconstructed proﬁle, like the one we
have seen in Fig. 1(b). The complete analytical expressions
are rather complicated and we will approximate them by per-
forming an expansion up to the leading order of w. This will
give us an insight into relative scales of parameters involved
in the procedure.

to the standard interferogram envelope

In Fig. 1(c) we depict the Wigner function for the example
discussed in this paper. The Wigner function contains two
peaks corresponding to the two reﬂective surfaces, and an
oscillating interference pattern located half-way between the
peaks. This pattern is a signature of coherence between the
two reﬂections. Dispersion introduces time-frequency cor-

standard OCT the depth proﬁle is retrieved as
which is
given as a square root of W (τ, Ω) integrated along the Ω axis.
Then the dispersion-induced tilt severely deteriorates the res-
olution. However, taking a cross-section through the Wigner
function along a horizontal line for Ω = 0, yields a dispersion-
free proﬁle. The problem with this proﬁle is that it contains

strong contributions from the interference pattern[13] which
were washed out in
due to the integration over the fre-
quency variable. The answer to this problem is to carefully
average the proﬁle over a range of frequencies Ω. This is ex-
actly the purpose of the generalized autoconvolution function
in Eq. (1), which can be rewritten in the Wigner formalism as:

The averaging along the frequency axis over an interval de-
ﬁned by the parameter w rapidly washes out the contribution
from the interference pattern, while nearly retaining the width
of the genuine peaks. The width of the interval must be larger
than the spacing of the interference pattern, which in turn is
inversely proportional to the separation between the peaks. As
shown by Abouraddy et al.[10], the effects of dispersion can
be removed using a quantum effect of two-photon interfer-
ence. Interestingly, the depth proﬁle obtained from the joint
detection of two photons in their case yields the same order
correlation function as Ξw(τ ). This equivalence is related to
the fact that in the quantum OCT scheme only one of the two
photons passes through the dispersive medium.

In conclusion, we have shown that the generalized autocon-
volution function calculated from the complex interferogram
envelope can reveal location of reﬂective surfaces in a disper-
sive medium with a resolution reaching the coherence length
of the employed light itself. We expect that in the case of
more complex depth proﬁles, the oscillatory character of the
artefacts will lead to similar suppression efﬁciency as that in
the simple numerical example discussed here.

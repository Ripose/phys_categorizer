Abstract

Based on boundary continuous conditions and dispersion relations, the anomalous propaga-

tion of waves incident from isotropic right-handed medium(RHM) into quasiistotropic left-handed

medium(LHM) are investigated. Under which condition can the anisotropic material be regarded

as quasiistropic LHM is discussed in detail. The anomalous negative refraction and total reﬂection

can occur at a planar interface associated with quasiisotropic LHM. It shown that the properties

of waves propagation in quasiisotopic LHM are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that in isotropic or

anisotropic LHM.

INTRODUCTION

Over thirty years ago, Veselago ﬁrstly introduced the concept of left-handed material

(LHM) in which both the permittivity ǫ and the permeability µ are simultaneously negative

[1]. Veselago predicted that LHM would have some unusual electrodynamic properties dif-

ferent from the conventional right-handed material (RHM), such as the negative refraction

index, the reversed Doppler shift, the backward Cerenkov radiation. LHM did not receive

much attention as it does not it does not exist in nature. After the experimental observation

using a metamaterial composed of wires and split ring resonators [2, 3, 4, 5], the study of

such materials have become a hot point in the last few years [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].

While negative refraction is most easily visualized in an isotropic material with negative

refractive index, negative refraction can also be realized in anisotropic media in which the

uniaxial LHM are mostly concerned [13, 14, 15]. Recently, Shen et al proposed that the exact

necessary and suﬃcient conditions of the uniaxially anisotropic LHM without dissipation

and found some oversights in the relevant understanding in the previous literature. When

comparing the generalized LHM with the regular RHM, they suggested two new concepts,

which have never been used in the regular RHM, the quasiisotropy and the planes of optics

In the present work, we discuss the condition under which kind of anisotropic material

can be regarded as quasiistropic LHM. We ﬁnd the medium with single-sheeted hyperboloid

dispersion relation can not be regarded as quasiisotropic LHM. The anomalous negative

refraction and total reﬂection can occur at a planar interface associated with quasiisotropic

LHM. We ﬁnd that the properties of waves propagation in quasiisotopic LHM are signiﬁ-

cantly diﬀerent from that in isotropic or anisotropic LHM.

II. DISPERSIVE RELATIONS OF QUASIISOTROPIC LEFT-HANDED MATE-

axes [16].

RIAL

For anisotropic materials one or both of the permittivity and permeability are second-rank

tensors. To simplify the proceeding analysis, we assume the permittivity and permeability

tensors are simultaneously diagonalizable:

where εi and µi are the permittivity and permeability constants in the principal coordinate

system (i = x, y, z).

We choose the z axis to be normal to the interface, and the x, y axes locate in the plane

of the interface. We assume plane wave with frequency ω incident from isotropic RHM into

anisotropic LHM. In isotropic RHM the accompanying dispersion relation has the familiar

form

tion [16]

Here ki is the i component of the propagating wave vector and c is the speed of light in

vacuum. εI and µI are the permittivity and permeability, respectively.

In the anisotropic LHM if the permittivity and permeability constants satisfy the relation:

where C is a constant, then the E- and H- polarized waves have the same dispersion rela-

where qi represents the i component of transmitted wave-vector. Based on the dispersion

relation the wave-vector surface which can be divided into three types: ellipsoid, single-

sheeted hyperboloid and double-sheeted hyperboloid.

As a quasiisotropic LHM should has some typical properties: In any allowed propagation

directions, E- and H- polarized waves have the same wave-vector surface and the Poynt-

ing vectors of E- and H- polarized waves propagate in the same direction.

In following

analysis, we will explore under which condition the anisotropic material can be regarded as

quasiistropic LHM.

The z-component of the wave vector can be found by the solution of Eq. (4), which yields

where σ = +1 or σ = −1. The choice of the sign ensures that light power propagates away

from the surface to the +z direction. In principle the occurrence of refraction requires that

the z component of the wave vector of the refracted waves must be real. Then the incident

angle must satisfy the following inequality:

Without loss of generality, we assume the wave vector locate in the x − z plane (ky =

qy = 0). The incident angle of light is given by

The values of refractive wave vector can be found by using the boundary condition and

dispersion relations. The refractive angle of the transmitted wave vector or phase of E- and

H- polarized waves can be written as

P = tan−1

P = tan−1

The Poynting vector ST of the refracted waves can be obtained, which determines the

actual propagation direction of the energy. For E- polarized incident waves, the Poynting

vector is given by

For H-polarized incident waves, the Poynting vector is given by

S(E)

The refraction angle of Poynting vector of E- and H- polarized incident waves can be

obtained as

As can be seen from Eq. (9) and Eq. (10), one can see that the direction of z component
of the Poynting vector will be determined by q(E)

z /µx for E-polarized waves and q(H)

z /εx for

H-polarized waves, respectively. Energy conservation requires that the z component of the

energy current density of the refracted waves must propagates away from the interface, for
instance, q(E)

z /εx > 0. Using the boundary condition q(E)

z /µx > 0 and q(H)

x = q(H)

x = kx, if

εx/µx = εz/µz = C > 0 and one have q(E)

z = q(H)

z

. From Eq. (8) and Eq. (11) we can obtain

P = β(H)
β(E)
P ,

S = β(H)
β(E)
S .

This means the wave vector and Poynting vector of E- or H- polarized ﬁeld propagate in
the same direction. If εx/µx = εz/µz = C < 0 one have q(E)

. From Eq. (8) and

z = −q(H)

z

Eq. (11) we can get

β(E)
P = −β(H)
P ,

β(E)
S = −β(H)
S .

the refraction angle of the wave vector and Poynting vector for E-polarized wave are always

opposite to those for H-polarized wave. So we can conclude that for a quasiistropic medium

the condition C > 0 should be satisﬁed, because the medium with single-sheeted hyperboloid

dispersion relation (C < 0) can not be regarded as quasiisotropic LHM.

III. QUASIISOTROPIC LEFT-HANDED MATERIAL

Unlike isotropic medium, the Poynting vector in quasiisotropic LHM is neither parallel

nor antiparallel to the wave vector, but rather makes either an acute or an obtuse angle

with respect to the wave vector or phase velocity. In general, to distinguish the positive and

negative refraction in quasiisotropic LHM, we must calculate the direction of the Poynting

vector with respect to the wave vector. From Eq. (9) and Eq. (10) we get

kx · S(E)

T =

T =

EE2

T 2

2ωµz

.

Positive refraction means the condition

and anomalous negative refraction means

This anomalous negative refraction phenomenon is one of the most interesting peculiar

properties of quasiisotropic LHM. In the following section we will discuss which of the above

three types medium can be regarded as quasiistropic LHM. Further we will discuss the

anomalous propagation in these medium.

Quasiisotropic LHM

FIG. 1: The circle and ellipse represent the dispersion relations of isotropic RHM and quasiisotropic

LHM, respectively. The wave vector and Poynting vectors of E- and H- polarized waves propagate
in the same direction. The ellipsoid wave-vector surface has two subtypes: (a) β(E)
S = β(H)
β(E)

S > 0. (b) β(E)

P < 0, β(E)

P = β(H)

P = β(H)

S = β(H)

P > 0,

S < 0.

A. Ellipsoid wave-vector surface

If all the εi and µi have the same sign (C > 0), the wave-vector surface must be an

ellipsoid. The ellipsoid dispersion relation has two subtypes which can be formed from

combinations of the material parameter tensor elements.

I. For εi > 0 and µi > 0, the refraction diagram is shown in Fig. 1a. In this case kz · qz > 0

and kx · ST > 0. From Eqs. (9) and (10), if εx/µx = εz/µz = C > 0 one can ﬁnd the

Poynting vector of E- and H- polarized ﬁeld will refract in the same direction, i.e.

β(E)
P = β(H)

P > 0,

β(E)
S = β(H)

S > 0.

In this case the refraction angle of wave-vector and Poynting vector are always positive.

II. For εi < 0 and µi < 0, the refraction diagram is shown in Fig.1b. In this case kz · qz < 0

and kx · ST < 0. From Eqs. (9) and (10), we can easily obtain

β(E)
P = β(H)

P < 0,

β(E)
S = β(H)

S < 0.

In this case the refraction angle of wave vector and Poynting vector are always negative.

From Eqs. (17) and (18), one can ﬁnd the Poynting vector of E- and H- polarized waves

will refract in the same direction. So the medium with ellipsoid dispersion relation can be

regarded as quasiisotropic LHM.

(22)

For E- or H- polarized incident waves, the occurrence of refraction require that the

incident angle must be smaller than a critical angle:

where the critical angle can be obtained from Eq.(6) as

−|θIC| ≤ θI ≤ |θIC|,

|θIC| = sin−1

εzµy/εIµI

.

(cid:20)q
If the incident angle is larger than the critical angle θIC, qz will be imaginary and the incident

(cid:21)

waves shall be totally reﬂected. If εzµy ≥ εIµI the critical angle θIC will be equal to π/2. In

this case, for any incident angles the anomalous total reﬂection phenomenon can not occur.

B. Single-sheeted hyperboloid wave-vector surface

If C < 0 and only two of εi have the same sign, for instance εx · εy > 0, the wave-vector

surface is a single-sheeted hyperbola. This medium has two subtypes:

I. For the case of εx > 0, εy > 0 and εz < 0, the refraction diagram is plotted in Fig. 3a.
For E-polarized incident waves kz · q(E)
z > 0, kx · S(E)
kz · q(H)
S(H)
T z have the same sign, but S(E)

T < 0. From Eqs. (9) and (10), if εx/µx = εz/µz = C < 0, S(E)

T < 0. For H-polarized incident waves

T x are always in the opposite sign, i.e.

z > 0, kx · S(E)

T x and S(H)

T z and

P = −β(H)
β(E)

P > 0, − β(E)

S = β(H)

S < 0.

II. For the case of εx < 0, εy < 0 and εz > 0, the refraction diagram is plotted in Fig. 3b.

In this case kz · qz < 0 and kx · ST > 0, we can get

−β(E)

P = β(H)

P < 0,

β(E)
S = −β(H)

S > 0.

From Eqs. (21) and (22), one can ﬁnd the refraction angle of the wave vector and Poynting

vector for E-polarized wave are always opposite to those for H-polarized wave. Considering

the properties of the quasiistropic LHM, we conclude that the medium with single-sheeted

hyperboloid dispersion relation can not be regarded as quasiisotropic LHM, although E- and

H- polarized waves have the same wave-vector surface.

For E- or H- polarized incident waves, anomalous total reﬂection can be obtained from

Eq. (6). The occurrence of refraction require that the incident angle must locate in the

branch:

−π/2 < θI < −|θIC| or |θIC| < θI < π/2.

If the incident angle is smaller than the critical angle −|θIC| < θI < |θIC|, qz will be

θIC will be equal to π/2. In this case, the waves shall be totally reﬂected for any incident

angles.

i.e.

C. Double-sheeted hyperboloid wave-vector surface

If C > 0 and only two of εi have the same sign, for instance εx · εy > 0, the wave-vector

surface is a double-sheeted hyperbola. Also this medium has two subtypes:

I. For the case of εx > 0, εy > 0 and εz < 0, the refraction diagram is shown in Fig. 3a. In

this case kz · qz > 0 and kx · ST < 0. From Eqs. (9) and (10), if εx/µx = εz/µz = C > 0 one

can ﬁnd the Poynting vector of E- and H- polarized ﬁeld will refract in the same direction,

β(E)
P = β(H)

P > 0,

β(E)
S = β(H)

S < 0.

(24)

It yields that the refraction of Poynting vector is always negative while the refraction of

wave vector is always positive.

II. For the case of εx < 0, εy < 0 and εz > 0, the refraction diagram is shown in Fig. 3b. In

It yields that the refraction of the wave vector refraction is always negative, while the

refraction of Poynting vector is always positive.

From Eqs.

(24) and (25), one can ﬁnd the Poynting vector of E- and H- polarized

waves will refract in the same direction. So the medium with double-sheeted hyperboloid

wave-vector surface can be regarded as quasiisotropic LHM.

For E- or H- polarized incident waves, the refraction can occur for any incident angle

−π/2 < θI < π/2.

(26)

In this case, the anomalous total reﬂection phenomenon never occur.

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have discussed in detail under which condition the anisotropic material

can be regarded as quasiistropic LHM. We have shown that the medium with ellipsoid

and double-sheeted hyperboloid dispersion relation can be regarded as quasiisotropic LHM,

9

while the medium with single-sheeted hyperboloid dispersion relation can not be regarded

as quasiisotropic one. The anomalous negative refraction and total reﬂection can occur at a

planar interface associated with quasiisotropic LHM. We have shown that the properties of

waves propagtion in quasiisotopic LHM are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that in isotropic or

anisotropic LHM.

(Dated: 2nd February 2008)

A theoretical and experimental investigation of the eﬀects of mode coupling in a resonant macro-
scopic quantum device is achieved in the case of a ring laser. In particular, we show both analytically
and experimentally that such a device can be used as a rotation sensor provided the eﬀects of mode
coupling are controlled, for example through the use of an additional coupling. A possible general-
ization of this example to the case of another resonant macroscopic quantum device is discussed.

Devices using macroscopic quantum eﬀects [1] and
their associated phenomenon of interference to detect ro-
tations can be arbitrarily divided into two classes [2],
In devices
namely non-resonant and resonant devices.
of the ﬁrst class, the rotation-induced phase shift is de-
tected by looking at the displacement of an interference
pattern. Among such devices are the ﬁber optic gyro-
scope [3], the gyromagnetic gyroscope [4], the superﬂuid
gyrometer [5] and the atomic interferometer [6]. In de-
vices of the second class, the rotation is detected through
a beat signal. Two examples of resonant and potentially
rotation-sensitive devices are the ring laser [7] and the su-
perﬂuid (e.g.
liquid helium or Bose-Einstein condensed
gas) in a ring container [8]. In these two examples, it has
been shown [9, 10] that a non-linear mode coupling eﬀect
plays a crucial role in the system dynamics, usually pre-
venting it from operating in a rotation sensitive regime,
unless an additional adequate coupling is set.

For example, in the case of the ring laser, the bidi-
rectional emission regime, required for rotation sensing,
can be inhibited because the counter-propagating modes
share the same gain medium and can be subject to mode
competition. This problem is usually circumvented by
choosing for the gain medium a two isotopes mixture of
helium and neon and by tuning the laser emission fre-
quency out of resonance with the atoms at rest. Pro-
vided the detuning value is bigger than the atomic nat-
ural linewidth, the gain medium can then be considered
as being inhomogeneously broadened and coexistence of
the counter-propagating modes occurs [11]. In the case of
solid-state ring lasers, the gain medium is homogeneously
broadened, leading to a strongly coupled situation result-
ing in laser emission in only one direction [10].

We report in this Letter theoretical and experimen-
tal investigation of mode coupling control in a solid-state
(Nd:YAG) ring laser. The main natural sources of cou-
pling between the counter-propagating modes are iden-
tiﬁed, and their role in the laser dynamics is discussed.
An additional coupling source is introduced in order to
ensure the coexistence of the counter-propagating modes.

A condition for rotation sensing is then analytically de-
rived, and an experimental conﬁrmation of this theoreti-
cal investigation is reported. It is eventually pointed out
that the two-level toy model developed in [9] to describe
a superﬂuid placed in a rotating ring container leads to
a similar rotation sensitive operation condition, opening
the way to a possible generalization of this investigation
to the case of other resonant macroscopic quantum de-
vices.

The laser equations are derived in the framework of
Maxwell-Bloch theory using abiabatic elimination of the
polarization [12]. We assume a single identical mode in
each direction of propagation and neglect transverse ef-
fects. The total ﬁeld inside the cavity is taken as the sum
of two counter-propagating waves :

will ﬁrst assume γ1 = γ2 = γ), σ the stimulated emis-

version density function, η the excess of pump power
above the threshold value Wth, T1 the population in-
version relaxation time and a the saturation parameter.
The rotation-induced angular eigenfrequency diﬀerence
Ω between the counter-propagating modes is linked to

the angular velocity ˙θ by the Sagnac formula [14] :

Ω =

8πA
λcT

˙θ ,

where A is the area enclosed by the ring cavity and c the
speed of light in vacuum. The parameter S = 4A/(λcT )
is known as the scale factor of the cavity. The detuning
of the cavity from the center of the gain line is deﬁned
as δ = (ωc − ωab)/γab, where ωc = kc is the resonance
frequency of the modes and ωab and γab are respectively
the position of the center and the width of the gain line.
For solid-state gain media, δ is usually smaller than 10−2.
Its eﬀects (among which is the dispersion of the refractive
index) will therefore be neglected in our analysis.

Because of the scattering of light induced by the mir-
rors and by the amplifying crystal, a fraction of the
power of each mode is injected back into the other, re-
sulting in mutual coupling. This eﬀect has been taken
into account phenomenologically in equation (1) using
the backscattering coeﬃcients ˜m1,2 = meiε1,2θ1,2 .
It
can cause phase synchronization and intensity stabiliza-
tion of the counter-propagating modes. The strength of
this coupling decreases when the speed of rotation in-
creases, as the diﬀerence between the eigenfrequencies of
the counter-propagating modes becomes more and more
important. Note that even if the backscattering coeﬃ-
cient is usually small (i.e. m ≪ γη), this coupling still
has to be taken into account for a correct description of
the modes dynamics.

Another source of coupling is caused by the estab-
lishment of a population inversion grating in the gain
medium, created by the light pattern resulting from
the interference between the counter-propagating waves.
This coupling corresponds in equation (1) to the term
proportional to the spatial Fourier transform of N at
the order 2k, and can be interpreted as resulting from
backward diﬀraction on the grating. When the speed of
rotation increases, the contrast of the grating (hence the
coupling strength) decreases because of the movement of
the light interference pattern and of the inertia of the
gain medium. More precisely, under the conditions :

a perturbation method applied to equations (1) and (2)

The presence of the grating hinders the coexistence of
the two counter-propagating modes because it results in

coupling source, to single mode (unidirectional) opera-
tion [10].

In order to counteract this eﬀect and to achieve rota-
tion sensitive operation, a stabilizing additional source
of coupling is provided to the system. This is done by
producing losses which depend on the intensity diﬀerence
between the counter-propagating modes according to the
following law :

,

γ1,2 = γ − ε1,2K

a| ˜E1|2 − a| ˜E2|2
(cid:16)
where K is chosen to be positive so that the mode with
the higher intensity gets the higher losses. The associated
eﬀective coupling coeﬃcient is on the order of Kη. A
concrete manner of generating such losses will be detailed
further in this Letter.

In the zone where ˙θ < ˙θcr the coupling generated by the
population inversion grating dominates, while in the zone
where ˙θ > ˙θcr it is the additional stabilizing coupling that
dominates. This latter zone turns out to be the zone of
rotation sensitive operation, as we will see further.

To proceed, equations (1) and (2) have been solved
under the conditions (4). We looked for a solution cor-
responding to the beat regime, i.e. obeying the following

where Φ is the diﬀerence between the arguments of ˜E1
and ˜E2. We obtained the following expression for the
relative intensity diﬀerence in the beat regime :

(9)

The existence of the beat regime is subject to the self-
consistency condition (8) for high rotation speeds. As
can be seen on equation (9), this depends both on ˜N and
on ηK.

If we ﬁrst consider the absence of additional coupling
(K = 0), we see on equation (9) using expression (5) that
the relative intensity diﬀerence diverges linearly with Ω.
This is in contradiction with condition (8) and leads to
the conclusion that the beat regime does not exist in
this case. Instead, the laser might turn to unidirectional
operation [15].

In the case where the additional coupling is present
(K 6= 0), the relative intensity diﬀerence goes to zero like
1/Ω, satisfying the self-consistency condition (8). It can
then be shown that the beat regime is stable if :

ηK > ˜N .

(10)

Inequality (10) is equivalent to ˙θ > ˙θcr, which means that
the second zone of ﬁgure 1 is indeed the zone of rotation
sensing operation.
It is remarkable that even for very
small (positive non-zero) values of K the beat regime is
stable for suﬃciently high rotation speeds.

We now report experimental achievement of the device
described above. The stabilizing additional coupling is
provided to the CW diode-pumped Nd-YAG ring laser
cavity using the setup of ﬁgure 2. This conﬁguration,
which is inspired from the one used in ring lasers in or-
der to achieve unidirectional single-mode operation [16],

◦
vertical scales). For rotation speeds lower that ˙θcr ≃ 19
/s,
the stabilizing coupling is dominated by the eﬀects of the pop-
ulation inversion grating and no beat frequency is measured.
From the asymptotic linear dependance, we get an experimen-
tal value for the scale factor S = 0,83 ± 0,01 kHz/(◦/s). This
is in perfect agreement with the Sagnac formula (3) for the
dimensions and the emission wavelength of our experimental
setup.

is based on the combination of three polarization-related
eﬀects. The ﬁrst eﬀect is a reciprocal rotation of the
polarization plane by the use of a slightly non planar
cavity. The rotation angle α depends on the geometry of
the cavity. The second eﬀect is a non reciprocal (Fara-
day) rotation of the polarization plane, produced by a
solenoid placed around the Nd-YAG rod. The rotation
angle β is proportional to the current ﬂowing through the
solenoid. The third eﬀect is a polarizing eﬀect, achieved
by replacing one of the cavity mirrors with a polariz-
ing mirror. The diﬀerential losses are then to the ﬁrst
order equal to γ1 − γ2 = 4αβ/T . The light intensities
of the two counter-propagating modes are monitored by
two photodiodes, and the value of β is kept proportional
to the diﬀerence between those intensities by the mean
of an electronic feedback loop acting on the current in-
side the solenoid. This results in diﬀerential losses of the
form (6).

The two ranges of ﬁgure 1 have been identiﬁed exper-
imentally, with a measured value of ˙θcr ≃ 19◦/s. Below
this critical rotation speed, we observe instabilities of the
intensities of the modes, and no beat signal. Above ˙θcr,
the intensities of the two modes are stable and similar in
magnitude and a beat signal is observed. The measured
frequency of this beat signal as a function of the rotation
speed is reported on ﬁgure 3.

This frequency response curve matches the Sagnac line
for high values of the rotation speed. For slower rota-
tions (but still above ˙θcr), we observe a deviation from

the Sagnac line. This deviation is partly due to the lin-
ear coupling induced by backscattering on the mirrors
and on the Nd-YAG crystal (Adler pulling) and partly
due to the coupling induced by the population inversion
grating (this last phenomenon can be interpreted as re-
sulting from Doppler shift on the moving population in-
version grating). The beat frequency < ˙Φ > (where <>

under the condition (8), leading to the following formula :

(11)

This expression is in good agreement with our experi-
mental data for ˙θ & 50◦/s (see ﬁgure 3). The linear
dependance of < ˙Φ > on the pump power (represented
by the parameter η) for a ﬁxed rotation speed has been
checked experimentally. The result is given for ˙θ = 70◦/s
on ﬁgure 4. This is a direct manifestation of the coupling
between the counter-propagating modes induced by the
population inversion grating in a solid-state ring laser.

Before concluding, it is worth noting that the physical
system composed of a superﬂuid in a ring container has
some similarities with the system described in this Letter,
at least in the limit of the two-level toy model of [9]. In
this model, the condition for the system to be rotation
sensitive reads :

rotation, is more diﬃcult when repulsive interactions are
stronger and is easier when the trap is asymmetric. Con-
dition (12) has to be compared with condition (10). In
both cases, these conditions express the fact that the sys-
tem is rotation-sensitive provided that a ’good’ additional
coupling is stronger than a ’bad’ non-linear coupling. We
expect that achieving condition (12) in a physical system
will lead to new atomic sensors concepts in the same way
as achieving condition (10) in an optical system allows
the realization of a solid-state ring laser gyroscope.

In conclusion, we have shown that the solid state ring
laser provides a good illustration of mode coupling con-
trol in a resonant macroscopic quantum device. In par-
ticular, rotation sensing has been achieved by the use of
a stabilizing mode coupling eﬀect that counteracts the
destabilizing eﬀect of the population inversion grating.
The simple theoretical model we used is in good agree-
ment with the reported experimental results. This work
opens new perspective for the realization of solid state
laser gyrometers. In addition, it shows the importance
of interplay between mode couplings in a system with
periodic boundary conditions. The same concept can be
applied in more complex systems like toroidal superﬂu-
ids, a ﬁeld in which an important experimental eﬀort is
being made at the moment [17].

Local bifurcation control is a topic of fundamental importance in the ﬁeld of nonlinear dynamical
systems. We discuss an original example within the context of storage-ring free-electron laser physics
by presenting a new model that enables analytical insight into the system dynamics. The transition
between the stable and the unstable regimes, depending on the temporal overlapping between the
light stored in the optical cavity and the electrons circulating into the ring, is found to be a Hopf
bifurcation. A feedback procedure is implemented and shown to provide an eﬀective stabilization
of the unstable steady state.

PACS numbers: 05.45.-a

Transition from stability to chaos is a common char-
acteristic of many physical and biological systems [1, 2].
Within this context, local bifurcation control is a topic
of paramount importance especially for those systems
in which stability is a crucial issue. This is, for ex-
ample, the case for conventional and non conventional
light sources, such as Storage-Ring Free-Electron Lasers
(SRFELs), commonly employed in various scientiﬁc ap-
plications [3]. In a SRFEL [4], the physical mechanism
responsible for light emission and ampliﬁcation is the in-
teraction between a relativistic electron beam and the
magnetostatic periodic ﬁeld of an undulator. Due to the
eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld the electrons emit synchrotron
radiation, known as spontaneous emission. The light pro-
duced by the electron beam is stored in an optical cavity
and ampliﬁed during successive turns of the particles in
the ring. A given temporal detuning, i.e. a diﬀerence be-
tween the electron beam revolution period and the round
trip of the photons inside the optical cavity, leads to a cu-
mulative delay between the electrons and the laser pulses:
the laser intensity may then appear as “continuous wave
(cw)” (for a weak or strong detuning) or show a stable
pulsed behavior (for an intermediate detuning amount)
[5, 6]. The achievement of a large and stable “cw” zone
is a crucial issue, of fundamental importance for experi-
mental applications. In this Letter, we characterize the
transition between stable the unstable regimes as a Hopf
bifurcation. This result allows one to establish a formal
bridge with the ﬁeld of conventional lasers and to adopt
the universal techniques of control theory to enlarge the
stable signal region. We develop this idea by introducing
a new model which reveals to be particularly suitable for
analytic investigations.
The longitudinal dynamics of a SRFEL can be described
by a system of rate equations accounting for the coupled
evolution of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and of the longitu-
dinal parameters of the electron bunch [7, 8]. The tem-
poral proﬁle of the laser intensity, yn, is updated at each

pass, n, inside the optical cavity according to:

yn+1(τ ) = R2yn(τ − ǫ) [1 + gn(τ )] + is(τ ),

(1)

where τ is the temporal position of the electron bunch
distribution with respect to the centroid; R is the mir-
ror reﬂectivity; the detuning parameter ǫ is the diﬀerence
between the electrons revolution period (divided by the
number of bunches) and the period of the photons inside
the cavity; is(τ ) accounts for the proﬁle of the sponta-
neous emission of the optical klystron [9]. Assuming that
the saturation is achieved when the peak gain is equal to
the cavity losses, P , the FEL gain gn(τ ) is given by [7, 8]:

klystron. The evolution of the laser-induced electron-
beam energy spread is governed by the following equa-
tion:

Here σe is the equilibrium value (i.e. that reached at the
laser saturation) of the energy spread at the perfect tun-
ing and ∆T is the bouncing period of the laser inside the
∞
optical cavity; In =
−∞ yn(τ )dτ is the laser intensity
normalized to its equilibrium value (i.e. the saturation
value for ǫ = 0) and τs stands for the characteristic time
of the damped oscillation of electrons in their longitudi-
nal phase-space. Equations (1), (2) and (3) are shown
to reproduce quantitatively the experimental results [8].
In particular, the laser intensity displays a stable “cw”
behavior for small amount of detuning, while a pulsed

R

regime is found for ǫ larger than a certain critical thresh-
old, ǫc. This model represents the starting point of our
analysis.

Equation (1) characterizes the evolution of the statis-
tical parameters of the laser distribution: by assuming
a speciﬁc form for the proﬁle, it is in principle possible
to make explicit the evolution of each quantity. For this
purpose, we put forward the assumption of a Gaussian
laser proﬁle and compute the ﬁrst three moments. The
details of the calculations are given elsewhere [10].
In
addition, it is shown that for ǫ spanning the central “cw”
zone, the quantities (σl,n/στ,n)2 and [(τn + ǫ)/στ,n]2 are
small. Hence, a Taylor series expansion is performed and
second order terms neglected. Finally, by approximating
ﬁnite diﬀerences with diﬀerentials, the following contin-
uous system is found:

Here Ω represents the oscillation frequency of the elec-
trons in their longitudinal phase-space and α, the mo-
mentum compaction factor, is a characteristic parameter
of the storage ring. Note the redeﬁnition of σ which is
from hereon normalized to σ0. Although in approximate
form, system (4) still captures the main features of the
longitudinal SRFEL dynamics. In particular, the transi-
tion from the “cw” regime to the unstable (pulsed) steady
state occurs for a temporal detuning which is close to
the one found in the framework of the exact formulation,
hence to the experimental value. However, system (4)
fails in reproducing the correct behavior when the tran-
sition to the lateral “cw” zone is approached. In Figure
1 phase-space portraits for both the laser intensity and
the beam energy spread are plotted for diﬀerent values
of ǫ. Limit cycles are observed when ǫ > ǫc. For smaller
values of ǫ, the variables converge asymptotically to a
stable ﬁxed point. The latter can be analytically char-
acterized, thus allowing one to relate the electron-beam

energy spread, intensity, centroid position and rms value
of the laser distribution, to the light-electron beam de-
tuning. Through a stability analysis it is also possible to
determine the threshold value ǫc. To our knowledge this
study represents the ﬁrst attempt to fully characterize
the detuned SRFEL dynamics.

For any given value of the detuning ǫ, equation (11)
can be solved numerically, by using a standard bisection
method. The estimates of σ are then inserted in equa-
tions (7), (8), (9), to compute the corresponding values
of I, τ , σl. Results of the calculations (solid line) and
direct numerical simulations using the system (4) (sym-
bols) are compared in Figure 2, displaying remarkably
good agreement. It is worth stressing that, by means of
a perturbative analysis, a closed analytical expression for
σ as a function of ǫ is also found. The details of the quite
cumbersome calculations are given elsewhere [10].

As a validation of the preceding analysis, we consider
the case of perfect tuning, i.e. ǫ = 0, and compare our
estimate for the laser induced energy spread σl to the
value (σl)sm, derived in the context of the widely used
super-modes approach [11]. Both theoretical predictions
are then compared to experiments performed on the Su-
perACO and Elettra FELs. Results are given in Table I:
the improvement of the calculation based on equation (9)
is clearly shown. The results of Table I indicate that both
σl and (σl)sm are smaller than the experimental values.
This is probably due to the fact that the models neglect
the eﬀect of the microwave instability [12] resulting from
the electron beam interaction with the ring environment
(e.g. the metallic wall of the vacuum chamber). In the
case of Elettra the situation is complicated by the pres-
ence of a “kick-like” instability (having a characteristic
frequency of 50 Hz) which periodically switches oﬀ the
laser preventing the attainment of a stable “cw” regime
[13].

part of the eigenvalues as a function of ǫ is shown in Fig-
ure 3. The system is by deﬁnition stable when all the
real parts are negative. The transition to an unstable
regime occurs when at least one of them becomes posi-
tive. In general, the loss of stability takes place according
to diﬀerent modalities. Consider the case of a Jacobian
matrix with a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues and
assume the real parts of all the eigenvalues to be negative.
A Hopf bifurcation occurs when the real part of the two
complex eigenvalues becomes positive, provided the other
keep their signs unchanged [14]. This situation is clearly
displayed in Figure 3, thus allowing to conclude that the
transition between the “cw” and the pulsed regime in a
SRFEL is a Hopf bifurcation. The critical detuning, ǫc,
can be calculated (open circle in Figure (3)) and displays
good agreement with both the simulated data and the
experimental value. A closed relation for ǫc is also found
[10], by making use of the analytic expressions for the
ﬁxed points.

Having characterized the transition from the stable to
the unstable steady state in term of Hopf bifurcation
opens up interesting perspectives to stabilize the signal
and dramatically improve the system performance. In or-
der to maintain the laser-electron beam synchronism and
avoid the migration towards one of the unstable pulsed
zones of the detuning curve, existing second-generation
SRFELs, such like Super-ACO and UVSOR [15, 16], have
implemented dedicated control systems. The idea is to
re-adjust periodically the radio-frequency, thus dynami-
cally conﬁning the laser in the central “cw” zone. Even
though generally suitable for second-generation SRFELs,
these systems are inappropriate for more recent devices,
such as ELETTRA and DUKE. The latters are indeed
characterized by a much narrower region of stable signal

only occasionally experimentally observed [13], making a
priori impossible to pursuit the former strategy. On the
contrary, the approach here discussed exploits an univer-
sal property of SRFELs, thus allowing to overcome the
limitations of other schemes. The procedure consists in
introducing a speciﬁc self-controlled (closed loop) feed-
back to suppress locally the Hopf bifurcation and enlarge
the zone of stable signal. This is achieved by replacing
the constant detuning with the time-dependent quantity
[17]:

ǫ(t) = ǫ0 + β∆T ˙I ,

(12)

which is added to system (4). Here ǫ0 is assumed to be
larger that ǫc: when the control is switched oﬀ, i.e. β = 0,
the laser is unstable and displays periodic oscillations.
For β larger than a certain threshold, βc, the oscillations
are damped and the laser behaves as if it were in the “cw”
region. Note that, as soon as saturation is reached, ˙I = 0
and, thus, the stable regime is maintained asymptotically
for ǫ = ǫ0 > ǫc, i.e. well inside the former unstable zone.
The results of the simulations are represented in Figure
4.

This new theoretical insight sets the ground for exper-

4

imental tests [10]. In this respect, a signiﬁcant and re-
producible extension of the stable “cw” region using this
technique has been recently achieved at Super ACO [18].
This result fully conﬁrms our theoretical predictions.

In conclusion, in this Letter we propose a new approxi-
mate model of a SRFEL. This formulation enables a deep
analytical insight into the system dynamics, allowing one
to derive the explicit dependence of the main laser pa-
rameters on the temporal detuning. Results are fully con-
ﬁrmed by numerical simulations and show satisfactory
agreement with available experimental data. Further,
the transition between the stable and unstable regimes
is found to be a Hopf bifurcation, and the critical de-
tuning ǫc is calculated explicitly. Finally, we introduced
in the model a derivative feedback that is shown to sta-
bilize the laser intensity well beyond the threshold ǫc.

Abstract

Interfering liquid surface waves are generated by electrically driven vertical oscillations of two

or more equispaced pins immersed in a liquid (water). The corresponding intensity distribution,

resulting from diﬀraction of monochromatic light by the reﬂection phase grating formed on the

liquid surface, is calculated theoretically and found to tally with experiments. The curious features

of the diﬀraction pattern and its relation to the interference of waves on the liquid surface are used

to measure the amplitude and wavelength of the resultant surface wave along the line joining the

two sources of oscillation. Finally, a sample diﬀraction pattern obtained by optically probing sur-

face regions where interference produces a lattice–like structure is demonstrated and qualitatively

explained.

Surface waves are ubiquitous in nature. Also known as the Rayleigh wave, they appear

on solid as well as liquid surfaces resulting in diverse phenomena with useful applications.

In particular, it is well established that surface acoustic waves (henceforth SAW) are of

prime importance in solid state technology [1]. Investigations on SAW in liquids has been

relatively less. The traditional ‘ripple tank’ method of measuring the surface tension of a

liquid is one of the earliest studies [2]. Recent advances along related directions (thermally

activated liquid surfaces, spatial damping of liquid SAW, light scattering/photon correlation

spectroscopy of liquid SAW, to name a few) have been carried out and reported in [3, 4,

5, 6, 7]. The basic principle of light diﬀraction by liquid SAW remains the same as in

solids, though their quantitative features, the generation mechanism surely diﬀer. Ripples

on liquid surfaces, caused by external vibrations (usually electrically/thermally driven) act as

an eﬀective dynamical phase grating for incident radiation. The complex aperture function

of the phase grating is determined from the phase shift of the reﬂected wave due to variation

(sinusoidal) of the surface height [8]. A Fourier transform of the aperture function gives the

light ﬁeld strength on the screen from which the intensity can be obtained. Features of the

intensity distribution provide information on the liquid SAW as well as properties of the

liquid itself. Since liquid properties can be measured by other methods too, one is usually

more interested in ﬁnding out the nature of the SAW using external non–destructive probes

(such as light). Recently, Miao et al [9] have studied diﬀraction of light from circular ripples

on water and experimentally established the correlation between the diﬀraction pattern and

the SAW amplitude. Using the features of the intensity pattern, they have also measured the

SAW wavelength. In this letter, we focus our attention on diﬀraction by interfering SAW,

a topic which does not seem to have been dealt with much in the past. In other words, we

generate superposed waves on the liquid surface by electrically driven vertical oscillations

of slightly immersed metallic pins. The resulting interference pattern on the liquid surface

diﬀracts incident light. Our aim is to ﬁrst investigate how the superposed character of the

wave pattern on the liquid surface can be seen in the diﬀraction intensity.

A schematic diagram of the experimental set up is shown in Fig. 1. Water (about 1 cm

deep) is kept in a petri-dish of diameter 18.5 cm. A pin is glued to the diaphragm of a small

loud speaker, which is driven by a low frequency signal generator. A sinusoidal signal of

frequency Ω (220 Hz in our experiment) is used to make the pin vibrate, which acts as a SAW

exciter. Best results are obtained when the pin is just below the liquid surface. If the pin

is immersed more, splashing and other associated eﬀects can occur. To create superposed

waves on the surface we have glued two pins on the diaphragm of the same loudspeaker. The

separation betweem the pins is measured by a travelling microscope. The two pins oscillate

simultaneously, in phase, on the water surface and create individual circular waves about

their location which, in turn, interfere to produce the well–known two–source interference

pattern, shown in Fig. 2. A 5 mW He-Ne laser of wavelength λ (632.8 nm) and of beam-

diameter 1.5 mm is directed to fall on the water surface, where the superposed SAW is

formed. The angle of illumination (i.e. the angle at which the laser beam falls on the liquid

surface), i, in our experiment is 77 degrees. It is known that at frequencies of the order of

220 Hz the SAW decay length is much greater than the size of the illuminated spot [10]. Due

to Fraunhofer diﬀraction of light by the SAW phase grating, spots are observed on a screen,

placed at a reasonably large distance (3.15 meters in our case) from the water surface. The

images of the diﬀraction pattern are taken using a digital camera. The spurious noise in the

images is removed by using the ‘Photoshop’ software. The intensity of the diﬀraction spots

have been measured by a photodiode detector. The linear relation between the photodiode

current and the intensity of diﬀracted light has been checked.

The circular waves generated on the surface of the liquid due to more than one source

of disturbance (oscillation) can be approximated as a linear superposition of individual

sinusoidal waves. We can write the individual waves as ψ1 = h sin (Ωt − kr1) and ψ2 =

h sin (Ωt − kr2), where we assume that the two oscillations have the same frequency Ω,

wavenumber k and amplitude h. r1 and r2 are the distances of the oscillation sources from

the point of observation. In addition, we would be interested in focusing light at a point

3

along the line joining the two sources (solid line in Fig. 2). A sum of these two waves

produces a resultant wave proﬁle (along the line joining the sources):

(dashed line) and second order (dotted line) diﬀraction spots using eq. 3. Experimentally measured

intensity for these spots are shown by black ﬁlled, grey ﬁlled and open circles, respectively. The

linearity in variation of resultant SAW amplitude in water and applied voltage in signal generator

(also amplitude imparted by the exciter) is shown in the inset

The intensity distribution, given in eq. 3, demonstrates that at the location of zeros of

the Bessel function one would get vanishing intensity of the diﬀerent orders at diﬀerent SAW
amplitude. For instance, for n = 0, and x′ = 0, the intensity will vary as J 2

(for N = 2)

the value of h for which the intensity zero will be observed is a factor

smaller than the value for a single wave. We ﬁnd that the intensity zero at zeroth order will

appear nearly at half the h value obtained for the single wave case when

our experiment, since h is proportional to the voltage, we should be able to see this reduction

in h through the reduction in the applied voltage of the frequency generator. For more than

two sources of oscillation placed close by, we would expect a reduction by a factor of N

Fig. 3 shows a plot of the intensity as a function of the SAW height h. The black

second order diﬀraction spots, respectively; which veriﬁes the well-established theoretical

curve, obtained from eq. 3. In the inset of this ﬁgure we have shown the relation between

the applied voltage in the function generator (amplitude of oscillation imparted to the pin)

FIG. 4: Diﬀraction pattern of SAW on water surface

and the amplitude of the resultant SAW. A linear correlation is seen though we note that

the SAW amplitude is approximately 100 times smaller than the oscillation amplitude of

the exciter. We mention that we have obtained this correlation by ﬁrst calculating the SAW

amplitude from eq. 3 and then relating it with the applied voltage for the same intensity

on the diﬀraction pattern. We have measured the imparted amplitude of vibration of the

pin (in air) for diﬀerent values of the applied voltage, using a travelling microscope.

Fig. 4(a) shows the Fraunhofer diﬀraction patterns of monochromatic light by SAW when

a single pin has been used as SAW exciter. As the loudspeaker amplitude (applied voltage)

is increased slowly, at a certain amplitude of vibration the central spot vanishes (Fig. 4(b)).

We observe the reappearance(disappearance) of the central spot(ﬁrst order spot) when the

amplitude is increased further (Fig. 4(c)). For a single pin this vanishing of the central and

ﬁrst order diﬀraction spots takes place for applied voltages 4.5 V and 7.4 V, respectively.

Exactly similar diﬀraction patterns appear for two superposed waves (with light incident

along the line joining the sources) for applied voltages 2.4 V and 3.9 V, respectively. In other

words, for two pins zero order diﬀraction spot vanishes for nearly half of the applied voltage

compared to that in single pin, as we expect from the above theoretical understanding.

Similarly, for three pins the zero order spot vanishes when the applied voltage is 1.7 V.

The displacement (x′) of the nth order spot from the centre of the diﬀraction pattern is
Λcosi. Measuring x′ for single pin, we determined the SAW wavelength in our experiment to
be 2.1 mm. Moreover, with more than one pin (say two) for certain special values of kd/2

two interesting possibilities emerge, which, in turn can be used to check the wavelength of

the superposed liquid surface wave along the line joining the sources.

only for J0, which implies that we see only a central spot at maximum (100 %) diﬀraction

eﬃciency. This special feature, essentially arising out of complete destructive interference

can very easily check the value of the wavelength of the liquid surface waves. Keeping in

mind that the change in separation between the two pins (N=2) does not change the SAW

wavelength estimated above, this should correspond to d = Λ/2 = 1.05 mm, 3Λ/2 = 3.15

mm and 5Λ/2 = 5.25 mm. In our experiment, when the separations between the two pins are

1.0 mm, 3.0 mm and 5.2 mm except the central order, the intensities of the other diﬀraction

spots go to zero irrespective of SAW amplitude.

No change in diﬀraction pattern with changing N and h: A second feature emerges when

the diﬀraction pattern remains unchanged even when we increase the number of oscillation

sources (pins). This will happen when the factor sin N kd

particular, for N = 2 we have d = Λ

the values of d = Λ/3 = 0.7 mm, 2Λ/3 = 1.4 mm, 4Λ/3 = 2.8 mm and 5Λ/2 = 3.5 mm. In

In

our experiment, when the separation between the two pins are 1.4 mm, 2.7 mm and 3.4 mm

we observe identical diﬀraction patterns as shown in Fig. 4. The zero order diﬀraction spot

vanishes for the same applied voltage 4.5 V in each case. With identical conditions, when

we lift one of the two pins, we get the vanishing of the central spot at the same voltage. We

could not set the separation between the pins to values smaller than 1 mm. This restricted

us from checking this phenomenon for lower values of d. Therefore, the wavelength measured

by explicitly working with the argument of the delta function in the intensity expression,

can now be checked using superposed liquid surface waves.

The dispersion relation [Ω2 = αk3/ρ, where α and ρ are the surface tension and the

density of the liquid, respectively] also provides a third (theoretical) check on the value of

the SAW wavelength. Using this relation we have calculated the SAW wavelength to be

2.1 mm. Finally, using the values obtained above one can ﬁnd out the value of the phase

velocity [v =

2πα
Λρ ] of the liquid surface waves along the line joining the two sources [13].

We have calculated vp= 46 cm/sec.

It is certainly true that all our quantitative results are for the region along the line

joining the sources. At other oblique points of incidence (of laser light on the surface), or

more importantly in the region where the interference pattern shows interesting features,

we have not been able to ﬁnd the exact analytical expression for the intensity distribution

of diﬀracted light. Fig. 4(d) shows the diﬀraction intensity from the liquid surface when the

light is incident on a region near the dashed-dotted line in Fig. 2. The interference pattern

on the liquid surface in this region shows a ‘lattice–like structure’ (more precisely a phase

lattice). This structure is indeed reﬂected in the corresponding diﬀraction pattern shown in

Fig. 4(d). Further theoretical and experimental understanding of diﬀraction of light from

this region is left for future investigation.

To conclude, we have shown how the diﬀraction of light by interfering liquid surface waves

can help us quantify the nature of the superposed waves and also ﬁnd their wavelength along

speciﬁc directions (here, the line joining the oscilating pins). The change in the values of

the liquid SAW height (amplitude) with the number of oscillating sources is a measure of

the ”interference” eﬀect on the liquid surface.

It is possible, therefore, to comment on

the number of oscillating sources by systematically observing the changes in the diﬀraction

pattern as a function of height (voltage). Additionally, using the characteristics of the

superposed SAW and the resulting light diﬀraction features we have been able to provide a

way of crosschecking the SAW wavelength. Finally, we have been able to quantify how much

wave amplitude is generated in the liquid if the pins are vibrated at some deﬁnite amplitude

of the exciter. This of course is liquid speciﬁc and is an entirely empirical consequence.

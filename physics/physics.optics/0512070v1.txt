We studied numerically and experimentally the eﬀects of structural disorder on the performance
of ultraviolet photonic crystal slab lasers. Optical gain selectively ampliﬁes the high-quality modes
of the passive system. For these modes, the in-plane and out-of-plane leakage rates may be au-
tomatically balanced in the presence of disorder. The spontaneous optimization of in-plane and
out-of-plane conﬁnement of light in a photonic crystal slab may lead to a reduction of the lasing
threshold.

Over the past few years, tremendous progress has been
made in design and fabrication of photonic crystal slab
(PhCS) lasers that operate in infra-red (IR) spectrum
range [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. To realize an ultraviolet (UV)
PhCS laser, the feature size has to be reduced roughly by
a factor of four [8, 9] compared to IR PhCS. Fabrication
of such ﬁne structures inevitably generates random devi-
ations from the perfectly ordered structures. In passive
PhC devices such uncontrollable disorder has detrimental
eﬀect as it contributes to optical losses and limits light
propagation length. However, it is not clear how the dis-
order would aﬀect the performance of an active device,
e.g., a PhCS laser. In this letter we illustrate, through
numerical simulation and experiment, that structural dis-
order in a PhC laser may not be as detrimental as in a
PhC waveguide. Under some circumstances structural
disorder enables self-optimization of optical conﬁnement
in a PhCS, leading to a reduction of lasing threshold.

A PhCS utilizes index guiding to conﬁne light to the
plane of the slab [10]. In-plane conﬁnement is realized ei-
ther via a defect state located inside a photonic bandgap
(PBG) [2, 3, 4, 5], or a bandedge state with vanishing
group velocity [6, 7, 11, 12]. Light may escape from
the PhCS vertically through the top/bottom interfaces
into air/substrate or laterally via the edge of the peri-
odic pattern into air or unpatterned part of the slab.
The vertical leakage rate is characterized by the out-of-
plane energy loss per optical cycle Q−1
⊥ , and the lat-
eral by Q−1
. A defect state spatially localized in the
||
vicinity of an intentionally-introduced structural defect
typically has large leakage in the vertical direction, i.e.,
Q−1
. For a bandedge state, the lateral leakage
usually dominates over the vertical one, Q−1
|| ≫ Q−1
⊥ .
The total loss is described by Q−1
. Low
lasing threshold demands maximization of Qtot, which is
hindered by Q⊥ for a defect state and Q|| for a band-
edge state. Several designs aim at optimization of PhCS
lasers by balancing Q⊥ and Q|| via “gentle localization”
[4], e.g., phase-slip[3, 13], double-heterostructure [5].

Recently we realized the ﬁrst UV PhCS laser [8]. ZnO
ﬁlms were grown on sapphire substrates by plasma en-

hanced MOCVD [14]. Hexagonal arrays of cylindrical
air voids were patterned in the ZnO ﬁlms by focused
ion beam (FIB) etching technique. The lattice constant
a ∼ 120 nm, the radius of air cylinders R ∼ 30 nm.
Post thermal annealing was employed to remove the FIB
damage. Single-mode lasing at room temperature was
realized with optical pumping. The scanning electron
micrograph (SEM) of a ZnO PhCS is shown in Fig. 1(a).
Despite the long-range periodicity exhibited in the in-
set of Fig. 1(a), Fig. 1(b) reveals the deviation of the
fabricated pattern from the ideal honeycomb structure.
Such “crescent” deviation [15] caused optical scattering
on the length scale of a few lattice constants. It was ex-
pected to enhance radiative leakage of a PhCS laser based
on either defect state or bandedge mode. Moreover, the
propagation loss in a passive PhCS caused by random[16]
scattering was predicted to increase dramatically near a
photonic bandedge [17], where the bandedge-type PhCS
laser operates. Despite of these pessimistic expectations
based on passive systems, we show that the performance
of a PhCS laser may be less susceptible to the detrimen-
tal eﬀects of structural disorder. This is because optical
gain predominantly ampliﬁes the mode with the high-
est quality factor Qtot. For the highest-Qtot mode, the
vertical and lateral leakage rates may be automatically
balanced in the presence of disorder. This implies that
an appropriate amount of structural disorder could lead
to spontaneous optimization of in-plane and out-of-plane
conﬁnement of light in a PhCS.

To investigate how the disorder aﬀects the rates of ver-
tical and lateral leakages of light from a PhCS, we con-
sider a system schematically depicted in the inset of Fig.
2(a). A dielectric slab of thickness 180 nm and refractive
index n = 2.35 is sandwiched between air and substrate
(nsub = 1.78). Within the slab, N inﬁnitely-long grooves
run parallel to y-axis. The width of a groove is 22 nm,
the lattice constant of the disorderless structure is 100
nm. We consider light propagating in x-z plane, with
the electric ﬁeld along y-axis. Such system is 2D, that
allows numerical simulation of large statistical ensembles
of random systems. Despite the simpliﬁcation, the sys-
tem in Fig. 2(a) retains the property essential for our

2

the mode’s distribution in k|| (in-plane component of the
wavevector) space. In a perfectly periodic structure, the
bandedge mode has the highest-Qtot. It is spatially ex-
tended in x, thus has a narrow distribution in k|| [thick
dashed curve in Fig. 2(a)]. Next we intentionally create
a defect by increasing the spacing between two neighbor-
ing grooves at the center of the pattern to 150 nm. The
highest-Qtot mode is localized around this artiﬁcial defect
with a localization length of 140 nm. Strong localization
in x results in a broad distribution in k|| [thin dashed
curve in Fig. 2(a)], with the maximum lying closer to
the edge of substrate light-cone [dash-dotted vertical line
in Fig. 2(a)]. Its Qtot is limited by Q⊥, which is about
three times smaller than the corresponding Q|| in a sys-
tem of N = 24. In contrast, the bandedge mode is con-
centrated well beyond the light-cone in k||-space, thus its
Q⊥ is much higher. However, its spatial extension makes
the lateral leakage larger, hence its Qtot is limited by Q||.
To simulate the position disorder of air cylinders in
real structure [Fig. 1(b)], random variation of groove po-
sition xn is introduced. We choose ∆xn randomly from a
uniform distribution with the standard deviation δx =5,
10, 15 nm. δx characterizes the “strength” of disorder.
As the disorder is introduced, the highest-Qtot state dif-
fers from realization to realization, and the correspon-
dent Q||, Q⊥ as well as the frequency vary. We study
statistical distributions of these parameters and their de-
pendences on disorder strength δx and system size N .

In small systems (N = 12 and 24) with an artiﬁcial
defect and weak disorder (δx = 5 nm), the highest-Qtot
modes always concentrate around the defect at the cen-
ter of the pattern. These modes become more spatially
extended than those without disorder. Therefore, their
k||-distribution is narrowed and k|| component within
the light-cone is signiﬁcantly reduced [Fig. 2(a)]. This
reduction leads to a decrease in the vertical leakage,
thus, an increase in Q⊥. Meanwhile, Q|| starts increas-
ing as the mode gets less localized in real space. The
ensemble-averaged hQ||/Q⊥i, shown in Fig. 2(b), de-
creases monotonously to unity with increase of disorder
strength. Therefore, disorder removes the imbalance be-
tween vertical and lateral leakages of a single defect state,
making hQ||i ∼ hQ⊥i. As a result, the ensemble-averaged
quality factor hQtoti is slightly higher than that without
disorder. In a larger system or with stronger disorder,
the highest-Qtot mode is no longer pinned at the artiﬁ-
cial defect. Instead, it can explore the entire pattern to
ﬁnd the optimum conﬁguration for the best vertical and
lateral conﬁnement. This leads to a further increase of
hQtoti.

With the introduction of disorder, bandedge mode be-
comes less extended. As its “tail” moves away from the
boundaries of the pattern, the lateral leakage decreases,
thus Q|| increases. Meanwhile, the distribution in k||-
space is broadened and shifted closer to the light-cone
edge [Fig. 2(a)]. The increase in vertical leakage results

study of PhCS laser: the possibility of vertical (along
z-axis) and lateral (along x-axis) radiative escape. Us-
ing the ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) method,
we ﬁnd the mode of the passive system that has the high-
est Qtot [18]. A Gaussian pulse was launched at all spa-
tial points in the slab and the energy is allowed to leak
out radiatively. Simulation area is terminated by uni-
axially perfectly matched absorbing layer that absorbs
all outgoing waves. The pulse excites all modes within
30 nm wavelength range around 400 nm. After the ini-
tial multi-mode decay the ﬁeld distribution is stabilized
and the longest-lived mode can be seen. This is further
conﬁrmed by observing a mono-exponential decay of the
total energy [1, 18] stored in the system that allows de-
termination of Qtot. By integrating Poynting vector over
the corresponding interfaces[1], we obtained the outgoing
ﬂux in the vertical and horizontal directions, and Q⊥ and

Q||. In our simulation, Q−1
relation was
satisﬁed numerically to within 2%.

and the electric ﬁeld is concentrated inside the dielectric. (d)

laser beneﬁts from an increase of the pattern size, sim-
ply because a larger system provides a bigger pool of
modes from which the highest-Qtot mode can be selected.
This eﬀect should be more pronounced in PhCS micro-
lasers with 2D periodicity [Fig. 1(a)], due to the larger
phase-space compared to the numerically simulated sys-
tems with 1D periodicity.

Experimentally, we fabricated ZnO PhCS of dimen-
sions 4 × 4 µm, 6 × 6 µm, and 8 × 8 µm [Fig. 1(a)]. Since
the complete photonic bandgap in ZnO PhCS without
“undercut” was quite narrow [9], it was technically chal-
lenging to overlap PBG with ZnO gain spectrum. By
adjusting the magniﬁcation of focused ion beam system,
we were able to change the lattice constant a in ﬁne steps
of 3 nm over a wide range 100 − 160 nm. The ratio of the

in a decrease of Q⊥. The ensemble-averaged hQ||/Q⊥i,
shown in Fig. 2(b), rises continuously to unity with in-
creasing disorder strength. Again, disorder balances the
vertical and lateral leakages of the bandedge mode, as
it does to the defect state. However, for a bandedge
mode the increase in hQ||i is not as large as the de-
crease in hQ⊥i, thus hQtoti is slighter lower than that
without disorder. Nevertheless, as the pattern size N in-
creases, the total leakage rate decreases monotonically:
hQ−1
toti ∝ N −α [Fig. 3(a)]. The exponent α decreases
from 2.3 at δx = 5 nm to 1.9 at δx = 15 nm. Even with
the largest disorder we simulated (δx = 15 nm), no sat-
uration of hQ−1
toti with N is observed up to N = 48. This
behavior diﬀers fundamentally from that of a photonic

air hole radius R to the lattice constant a was also varied
from 0.20 to 0.30. In this way, we could tune PBG contin-
uously through ZnO gain spectrum. We also introduced
an artiﬁcial defect by missing an air hole. Structural
analysis as in Fig. 1(b) gives the average displacement
of a hole δr ≃ 0.22R.

ZnO PhCS was optically pumped by the third harmon-
ics of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser (λ = 355 nm, 10 Hz repe-
tition rate, 20 ps pulse width) at room temperature [8].
In 8 × 8 µm patterns without intentionally-introduced
structural defect, the ensemble-averaged lasing thresh-
old exhibited a pronounced minimum at a = 115 − 130
nm and R = 0.25a [Fig. 4(a)]. To understand this phe-
nomenon, we calculated the photonic bands in ZnO PhCS
using the computational technique described in Ref.[9].
The frequency dependence of ZnO refractive index was
taken into account. In Fig. 4 (b), the wavelength of the
dielectric bandedge λd for the fundamental PBG of TE
modes [8] is plotted against the lattice constant a. The
structural parameters were extracted from the SEM of
our samples. The ZnO slab thickness t = 180 nm, and
R/a = 0.245. By comparing the lasing wavelength to λd
in Fig. 4(b), we conﬁrmed that the lasing modes were lo-
cated in the vicinity of the dielectric bandedge. This can
be explained by two factors: (i) the electric ﬁeld of the
modes near the dielectric bandedge is concentrated in-
side ZnO, and thus experience more gain [Fig. 3(c)]; (ii)
the vanishing group velocity at the bandedge enhances
light ampliﬁcation [12]. The dip in the measured las-
ing threshold [Fig. 4(a)] is attributed to spectral over-
lap of the dielectric bandedge with ZnO gain spectrum.
In Fig. 3(b), the measured lasing threshold decreases
monotonously with the pattern size for a = 115 nm and
118 nm. These data agree qualitatively with the numeri-
cal simulation results shown in Fig. 3(a). In all patterns
with intentionally missed air holes, the lasing modes were
not pinned at the location of the missing hole due to the
existence of better conﬁned modes away from the defect.
This observation is in line with our numerical simulation
of large patterns with single artiﬁcial defect.

In summary, the structural disorder may lead to self-
optimization of optical conﬁnement in a PhCS and forma-
tion of high-Qtot modes which serve as the lasing modes.
In a suﬃciently large PhCS with short-range disorder,
a microcavity with balanced Q⊥ and Q|| can be formed
spontaneously without any carefully-designed structural
defects. Despite the disorder, photonic bandedge eﬀect
enables us to eﬃciently extract optical gain and to ﬁne-
tune the lasing wavelength from 383 nm to 407 nm with
sample-to-sample ﬂuctuation of about 5 nm in ZnO PhCS
lasers.

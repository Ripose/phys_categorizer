In recent experiments, localized and stationary pulses have been generated in second-order nonlin-
ear processes with femtosecond pulses, whose asymptotic features relate with those of nondiﬀracting
and nondispersing polychromatic Bessel beams in linear dispersive media. We investigate on the
nature of these linear waves, and show that they can be identiﬁed with the X-shaped (O-shaped)
modes of the hyperbolic (elliptic) wave equation in media with normal (anomalous) dispersion. De-
pending on the relative strengths of mode phase mismatch, group velocity mismatch with respect
to a plane pulse, and of the defeated group velocity dispersion, these modes can adopt the form of
pulsed Bessel beams, focus wave modes, and X-waves (O-waves), respectively.

INTRODUCTION

Stationary, temporally and spatially localized, X-
shaped optical wave packets, having a duration of a few
tens of femtoseconds and spot size of a few microns, have
been recently observed to be spontaneously generated in
dispersive nonlinear materials from a standard laser wave
packet [1, 2, 3]. Balancing between second-order or Kerr
nonlinearity, group velocity dispersion (GVD), angular
dispersion and diﬀraction, has been suggested to act as
a kind of mode-locking mechanism that drives pulse re-
shaping and keeps the interacting waves trapped, phase
and group-matched [4, 5, 6].

The purpose of the present paper is to investigate on
the nature of these waves. The main hypothesis underly-
ing our investigation is that these nonlinearly generated
X-shaped waves behave asymptotically as linear waves.
This assumption is based, ﬁrst, on the observed station-
arity, not only of the central hump of the wave packet,
but also of its asymptotic,
low-intensity, conical part
[1, 2, 3], stationarity that cannot be attributed to nonlin-
ear wave interactions, but to some linear mechanism of
compensation between material and angular dispersion.
Indeed, several kinds of linear polychromatic versions of
Bessel beams [7], as Bessel-X pulses [8, 9], pulsed Bessel
beams [10, 11], subcycle Bessel-X pulses or focus wave
modes [12], and envelope X waves [13], with the capa-
bility of maintaining transversal and temporal (longitu-
dinal) localization in dispersive linear media, have been
described in recent years (for an uniﬁed description and
the extension to media with anomalous dispersion, see
also Ref. 14). In contrast to free-space X-waves [15] and
Bessel-X pulses [16, 17], stationarity in dispersive me-
dia requires the introduction of an appropriate amount
of cone angle dispersion that leads to the cancellation of
material GVD with cone angle dispersion-induced GVD
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Second, polychromatic Bessel
beams, with or without angular dispersion [14], have the

ability of propagating at rather arbitrary eﬀective phase
and group velocities in dispersive media, as has to be
done by the phase matched and mutually trapped funda-
mental [3] and second harmonic [5] nonlinearly generated
X waves.

For these reasons, in this paper we present a new and
more comprehensive description of localized and station-
ary optical waves in linear dispersive media, henceforth
called wave modes, that is particularly suitable for un-
derstanding and predicting the spatiotemporal features
of the nonlinear X waves generated in experiments. On
the linear hand, this description allows us to predict the
existence of new kinds of wave modes, and classify all
them according to the values of a few physically mean-
ingful parameters.

Each wave mode is speciﬁed by the values of the de-
feated material GVD, the mode group velocity mismatch
(GVM) and phase mismatch (PM) with respect to a
plane pulse of the same carrier frequency in the same
medium. Wave modes are then shown (Section II) to
belong to two broad categories: hyperbolic modes, with
X-shaped spatiotemporal structure, if material dispersion
is normal, or elliptic modes, with O-shaped structure, if
material dispersion is anomalous [18]. In Section III we
show that each wave mode can adopt the approximate
form of 1) a pulsed Bessel beam (PBB), 2) an envelope
focus wave mode (eFWM), or 3) an envelope X (eX) wave
in normally dispersive media [envelope O (eO) wave in
anomalously dispersive media], according that the mode
bandwidth makes PM, GVM or defeated GVD, respec-
tively, to be dominant mode characteristic on propaga-
tion. This classiﬁcation allows us to understand the spa-
tiotemporal features of wave modes in dispersive media in
terms of a few parameters (the characteristic PM, GVM
and GVD lengths), including modes with mixed pulsed
Bessel, focus wave mode, and X-like (O-like) structure.

The above description is obtained from the paraxial
approximation to wave propagation. We choose this ap-
proach because of its wider use in nonlinear optics, and

because it leads to simpler expressions in terms of param-
eters directly linked to the physically relevant properties
of the mode and dispersive medium. In Section IV we
compare the paraxial and the more exact nonparaxial
approaches, to show that the paraxial approach is accu-
rate enough for the description of wave modes currently
generated by linear optical devices [9, 10] and in nonlin-
ear wave mixing processes [1, 2, 3].

Under the assumption of asymptotic linear behavior of
nonlinear X-waves, we can get some insight on the pos-

basis of the linear dispersive properties of the medium.
If, for instance, a pulse of frequency ωF generates a sta-
tionary and localized second harmonic pulse (ω0 = 2ωF )
travelling at the same group and phase velocities as the

of the paraxial wave equation, in the sense explained
above. As indicated, the integration domain extends over
frequencies Ω such that the dispersion curve K(Ω) is real.
According to Eq. (8), a wave mode Φα,β is composed of
locked monochromatic Bessel beams whose frequencies
and radial wave vectors are linked by a speciﬁc dispersion
relation K(Ω), and whose relative weights are determined
by a certain spectral amplitude ˆf (Ω).

sion (k′′

in which case the dispersion curve is an ellipse [see Fig.

Closely connected with the dispersion curve are the so-
called impulse response wave modes Φ(i)

longer singular and of X-type, but regular and, say, of

radially as 1/t and 1/r, respectively, with periods 2π/Ωg
and 2π/Kg. The absence of singularities is a consequence
of the actual limitation that the elliptic dispersion curve
imposes to the uniform spectrum ˆf (Ω) = 1.

III. CLASSIFICATION OF WAVE MODES

Numerical integration of Eq. (8) with a given disper-
sion curve (speciﬁed by the values of α, β and k′′
0 ) but
diﬀerent (bell-shaped) spectral amplitude functions ˆf (Ω)
having also diﬀerent (but ﬁnite) bandwidths ∆Ω [alter-
natively, numerical integration of

where f (τ ) is the inverse Fourier transform of ˆf (Ω)],
shows much richer and complex spatiotemporal features
in comparison with the case of inﬁnite bandwidth. These
features strongly depend on the choice of the spectral
bandwidth ∆Ω, while no essentially new properties arise
from the speciﬁc choice of ˆf (Ω) (Gaussian, Lorentzial,
two-side exponential. . . ). Modes with ﬁnite bandwidth
may exhibit mixed, more or less pronounced radial and
temporal oscillations, along with incipient or strong X-
wave (O-wave), focus wave mode or Bessel structure, as
explained throughout this section (see also the follow-
ing ﬁgures). The purpose of this section is to perform
a simple, comprehensive classiﬁcation of wave modes in
dispersive media.
In the remainder of this paper, ∆Ω
will refer to any suitable deﬁnition of half-width of the
bell-shaped spectral amplitude function ˆf (Ω).

Given a mode of parameters α and β satisfying con-
ditions (4) and (5), propagating in a dispersive material
with GVD k′′
0 , and some spectral bandwidth ∆Ω satisfy-
ing (2), we have found it convenient to deﬁne the three
following characteristic lengths: 1) the mode PM length

2) the mode walk-oﬀ, or GVM length

measuring, respectively, the axial distances at which the
mode becomes phase mismatched and walks oﬀ with re-
spect to a plane pulse of the same spectrum in the same
medium, and 3) the GVD length

of, the PM-dominated case [as in Fig.4(a) for most fre-
quencies], modes of some (still unspeciﬁed) intermediate
duration belong to the GVM-dominated case, and ex-
tremely short modes to the GVD-dominated case, since
Lp is independent on bandwidth, but Lp and Ld are in-
versely proportional to ∆Ω and ∆Ω2, respectively. De-
pending, however, on the relative values of α, β and k′′
0
(particularly when one or two of them are very small), the
GVM-dominated case, even the PM-dominated case, can
extend down to the single-cycle regime [as in Fig.4(b)
for most frequencies], or, on the contrary, the GVM-
dominated case, even the GVD-dominated case, apply
to considerably long modes [as in the vicinity of the two
singularities of the Lp-curve of Fig. 4(a)].

fundamental FWM is a localized, stationary free-space

We consider ﬁnally modes with

modes of short enough duration, or propagating in a
medium with large enough GVD. When material disper-

negative frequencies [as in Figs. 7(a) and (b), labels 1

minal (α > 0) or subluminal (α < 0) group velocity,
respectively. For modes with superluminal phase veloc-
ity (β > 0), K(Ω) is real everywhere [Fig. 7(b), label 1],
but for modes with subluminal phase velocity there is a
narrow frequency gap about Ω = 0 [Fig. 7(b), label 2]. A
prototype wave mode for this case can be obtained by in-
troducing the approximate dispersion curve of Eq. (26)
into Eq. (8). With the two-side exponential spectrum
ˆf (Ω) = (2π/∆Ω) exp(

The spatiotemporal form of the eX wave is shown in Fig.
7(c). For Ld/Lp = 1/6 (β > 0), Ld/Lw = 1/6 [thin
curves in Figs. 7(a) and (b), label 1], the mode retains
an X-shaped structure [Fig. 7(d)] despite the dispersion
curve diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the limiting one. Incipient
PBB behavior, or radial oscillations, originates from the
nearly horizontal dispersion curve in the central part of
the spectrum. For Ld/Lp =
1/6 (β < 0), Ld/Lw = 1/6
−
[thin curves in Figs. 7(a) and (b), label 2], the X-shaped
mode [Fig. 7(d)] shows instead incipient eFWM behavior
(light is within the cone), together with temporal oscil-
lations arising from the frequency gap in the dispersion
curve.

Note that the term with β, no matter how small it is,
must be retained to reproduce the real-valued part of the
dispersion curve. The group velocity of the mode can be
slightly subluminal (α < 0) or superluminal (α > 0), as
in Fig. 8(a) and (b) (thin curves), but the phase veloc-
ity of these modes is always superluminal (β > 0). An
approximate analytical expression for this type of modes
can be obtained by introducing the approximate disper-
sion curve of Eq. (28) into Eq. (8). Under condition

β = ω0α + 2γβs are made (γ and βs being the the free

with α = 0 yields the original Brittigham’s FWM [21, 22],
and the case with β = ω0α yields the Bessel-X pulse of

amplitude centered at an optical frequency, introduced
by Saari in Ref. 16, and demonstrated in Ref. 17.

In a dispersive media, and under conditions (4) and

dispersion curve [Eq. (7)] may signiﬁcantly diﬀer from
(34)], even if conditions (4)
the nonparaxial one [Eq.
and (5) are satisﬁed.
In fact, it is not diﬃcult to ﬁnd
set of parameters for which the nonparaxial dispersion
curve is, for instance, a vertical hyperbola, whereas the
paraxial dispersion curve is an horizontal hyperbola [see
Fig. 9(a)].

From a physical point of view, however, it is only the

For these PBBs, it is easy to see that the paraxial

in spite of the apparent drawback that PBBs are no

Accordingly, these modes are of PBB type, that is, the
paraxial dispersion curve within the bandwidth can be
approached by an horizontal straight line [see Fig. 10(d)
for ω0 = 2 fs−1 in fused silica]. Finally, the paraxial pro-
totype PBB for these modes is given, from Eq. (21), by

V. CONCLUSIONS

Summarizing, we have described and classiﬁed the
pulsed versions of Bessel beams with the property of be-
ing localized and remaining stationary (diﬀraction-free
and dispersion-free) during propagation in a dispersive
material with slightly super- or subluminal phase and
group velocities. As for the wave mode description,
we have found the analysis of the transversal dispersion
curve K(Ω) to be an useful tool to understand the spa-
tiotemporal mode structure. Wave modes have been clas-
siﬁed into three broad categories: PBB-like, eFWM-like,
and eX-like (eO-like) modes, depending on the relative
strength of their phase and group velocity mismatch with
respect to a plane pulse, and defeated GVD, as measured
by the mode phase-mismatch length Lp, group-mismatch
length Lw and the dispersion length Ld.

We have veriﬁed that the paraxial description leads
to the same description and classiﬁcation as would be
obtained from the more accurate nonparaxial approach
when the conditions of narrow bandwidth (2) and of
quasi-luminality (4,5) are satisﬁed. All previously re-
ported optical Bessel beams, X waves, Bessel-X waves,
or focus wave modes generated by linear or nonlinear
means satisfy indeed these requirements.

curve within the bandwidth can be approached by the
paraxial one, that is, by Eq.
(19), as illustrated in
Fig.9(b) for the extreme case (widest possible bandwidth)
of a single-cycle mode (∆Ω/ω0 = 1/2π). In particular, we
can aﬃrm that the description performed in Section III
of quasi-monochromatic, quasi-luminal modes in terms
of their characteristic lengths is independent of the ap-
proach used.

To illustrate the relationship between the paraxial and
nonparaxial approaches, and the type of results we can
expect from the paraxial one, we consider wave modes of

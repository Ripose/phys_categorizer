Abstract

The recently developed concept of refracting proﬁles and that of refraction holo-
diagrams are combined so that the classical Abramson holodiagrams can be gener-
alized taking into account a wider class of wave fronts and refraction at an interface,
whenever regions of caustics are avoided. These holodiagrams are obtained as en-
velopes of speciﬁc families of Cartesian Ovals with an appropriate parametrization.
Classical and reﬂecting holodiagrams are particular cases of this class. Several of
the properties of the classical holodiagrams are shared by their richer generalized
versions.

1 Introduction

In 1969 and 1970, Abramson (1; 2; 3; 4) proposed the use of a diagram that
condensed many useful properties of holographic registers, initially concern-
ing the optimal use of available coherence length and the interpretation of the
fringes obtained in holographic interferometry (5; 6). It consisted in a family
of ellipses showing the loci of equal optical path length between their common
foci and with an adequate parameterization: consecutive ellipses diﬀered in
integer steps of half the wavelength in the optical path length. The foci rep-
resented a light emitting point source and an observation point. The chosen

parameterization made interpretation of its cuts as Fresnel zone plates and its
volumetric regions as Bragg gratings. Fermats stationary phase principle was
also built in and permitted elementary ray tracing. Numerous additional and
non trivial uses have been found afterwards for that diagram, called Abramson
holodiagram (HD). They include interferometry sensitivity evaluation, light-
in ﬂight registers, Doppler velocimetry, Bragg diﬀraction, interpretation of
relativistic eﬀects and several others.

The concept of Abramson holodiagram, originally developed to describe free
propagation in an isotropic medium, has been broadened to include virtual
sources (7), refraction between two isotropic media (8; 9), free propagation
in birefringent media (10) and some geometrical aspects of spatial coherence
(11).

On the other hand, the concept of reﬂecting proﬁles (12; 13) has been devel-
oped to generate surfaces that modify a spherical wave front, giving place to
another previously determined wave front or, conversely, to focus a predeter-
mined wave front into a point. In a recent work (14) we have proposed that the
Holodiagram concept can be generalized with the aid of the reﬂecting proﬁles
concept. A generalized holodiagram can then be constructed as a family of
reﬂecting proﬁles with an adequate parametrization. It inherits several of the
properties of other holodiagrams deﬁned before.

Recently a method has been proposed to design suitable refracting proﬁles
(interfaces between two media with diﬀerent refractive index) for two diﬀer-
ent problems: to produce a given wave front from a single point source after
refraction on it, and to focus a given wave front on a chosen point after refrac-
tion (see (15)). In the present paper, the refracting proﬁle concept is included
into the holodiagram construction, giving rise to the concept of generalized re-
fracting holodiagram (GRHD), which includes all the (isotropic) holodiagrams
previously developed.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we use (15) and construct
two families of refracting proﬁles by using the optical properties of Cartesian
ovals (16). Each proﬁle is constructed as the envelope of a speciﬁc familiy of
Cartesian ovals, and depends of a parameter a that corresponds to half the
value of the optical path between the foci of the family of Descartes ovals used
in its construction.

In section 3 we use the two families of refracting proﬁles of section 2 to con-
struct two kinds of generalized refracting holodiagrams: one when both source
and image are real, and the other when the source is virtual (or the image is
virtual). To this end we discretize the values of the parameter a in multiples
of half the wavelength employed for illumination.

In section 4 we give some illustrative examples. Also in this section we use

2 Refracting proﬁles

}

Ra

Given a wave front W and a source point F , it is possible to construct a
of refracting proﬁles parametrized by a non-negative real number
family
a, with the property of producing normal rays to W after refracting the rays
that emerge from F at each proﬁle. If light propagation direction is reversed,
then the same family of proﬁles has the property of focusing the wave front W
in the point F . From now on we suppose that the refracting proﬁle separates
two media with refractive indices n1 and n2, F being in the region of n1, and
W in the region of n2.

The construction of the proﬁle Ra for the wave front W and the point F
proceeds (see (15)) by taking the envelope of a family of Descartes ovals of
x has foci F and x, x varies in W and the pa-
revolution
rameter a is such that 2a is the stationary optical path length between F and
x (see Fig. 1). Let us now recall some properties of the Cartesian ovals.

where a, b and k are constants. Observe that this equation includes the bifocal
deﬁnition of conics for the particular cases of k > 0 and a = b > 0 (ellipse), or
b > 0 (hyperbola). A Cartesian oval has a third focus F3, and the oval
a =
can be deﬁned by any two of the foci (see (16)). In particular when
goes

Only two of the four equations obtained from these double signs are not empty.
They are closed curves, one interior to the other (see Fig. 2 with F1 = F and
F2 = x). These two curves intersect only when two foci coincide. In this
case we get the so-called Lima¸con of Pascal. See (16) for a detailed study of
these ovals. In the context of the geometrical optics, the coeﬃcients a and b
correspond to the refractive indices, so that equation 1 gives the stationary
optical path length between the foci F1 and F2.

surfaces obtained when the above ovals are rotated around their focal axes. Let

These two sheets are the envelopes of the exterior and interior ovals respec-
tively. Figure 2 illustrates these sheets in a 2-dimensional example.

The proﬁles Ra are smooth surfaces except for the points y
Ra that are
centers of curvature of the wave front W , so proﬁles with singularities can
only appear for concave wave fronts. The geometrical locus of the centers of
curvature of W , or equivalently, the envelope of the normal lines to W , is
usually called the caustic, C, of W . The singularities of the proﬁles Ra sweep
out also the caustic as the parameter a varies (see (15)).

∈

We should observe that if we want that the proﬁles have physical sense, we have
to exclude the points y of the proﬁles such that the corresponding incidence
angle θ1 does not give a real value for the angle of refraction θ2. It occurs

5

when light is propagated from an optically denser medium into one that is
less optically dense, i.e. when n2 < n1, provided that the incidence angle θ1
exceeds the critical value θc given by sin θc = n2/n1.

3 Generalized Refraction Holodiagrams

Using the proﬁles Ra we can construct generalizations of both kinds of re-
fraction holodiagrams: one when both source and image are real (8), and the
other when the source is virtual (or the image is virtual) (9). The sheets Ra
2
correspond to generalizations of the ﬁrst case and the sheets Ra
1 to the sec-
ond. This is because for the particular case of W being a spherical wave front,
Ra
1) is an interior (respectively exterior) Cartesian oval as is
required in the ﬁrst and second cases respectively.

2 (respectively Ra

a) First case.

To construct the holodiagrams we take the family of proﬁles Ra
2 given by
equation 6 and i = 2, with the parameter a varying in halves of the wavelength,
so that Ra
2 is the envelope of a family of interior Cartesian ovals. From the
construction of Ra
W is
y
in the normal line from y to W . In this case, (see Fig. 2), if a is such that F
and W are at diﬀerent sides of the tangent plane to the proﬁle at any point of
it, then Ra
2 is a refracting focusing proﬁle); or reversing
the ray direction, W is reconstructed from light coming from the source point
F (Ra

2 focuses W in F (Ra

2 is a refracting proﬁle).

side of the tangent plane to the proﬁle at any point of it, then we have that any

at Ra
1 produces the wave front W . Equivalently, we have that the wave front W
after refracting at Ra

4 Results and examples

We show now some illustrative examples of both kinds of Generalized Refract-
ing Holodiagrams obtained with the described procedure.

The images are shown as gray levels proportional to 1 + cos(ra), with r a
scale constant, so that they depict as fringes the families obtained when the
parameter a is increased in a continuous way.

The shape of the fringes indicates the loci of stationary optical path sum or
diﬀerence and the geometry of a diopter such that when illuminated by a point
source at F generates a wave front in the shape of W . The orientation and
spacing of these fringes indicates the sensitivity to phase variations. Places
where fringes are dense indicate that phase changes fast there with position,
while the direction of the fringes indicates the zero sensitivity direction. Loci
of equal sensitivity, that is the K curves deﬁned by Abramson, can be nu-
merically determined from these ﬁgures. Phase changes or departure of the
calculated values could be due, for example, to construction errors in the re-
fracting surfaces. Then, the spacing between the fringes is an estimation of its
local construction tolerance.

front with sinusoidal form.

In a similar way as in other holodiagrams, a cut of these diagrams by an
arbitrary surface deﬁnes a generalized Fresnel Zone Plate. The now known as
Fresnel Zone Plate was invented by Lord Rayleigh; he wrote in 1871: ”The
experiment of blocking out the odd Huygens Zones so as to increase the light
of the center succeeded very well...” (17). A classical Fresnel Zone Plate is a
diﬀraction gratings device that consists in a binary pupil that is transparent
in alternate Fresnel zones and absorbing in the rest. When it is illuminated

by a spherical wave front, constructive interference occurs in certain points
of its axis and high intensity is observed there, so that these points can be
considered as images of the source. For each image point it can be considered
as a device that maps a spherical diverging wave front from the source into a
spherical converging wave front to the image or as the hologram of a point,
being all these descriptions equivalent. We are going to call a Generalized
Fresnel Zone Plate (GFZP) to a pupil that diﬀracts a predetermined wave
front when illuminated by a given one, in our case a spherical diverging wave
or, conversely it maps a given wave front into a spherical converging wave.
The GFZP is indeed a hologram and the new name is assigned to it only to

9

help in its interpretation.

Now, let us assume, as Abramson does, that the GRHD has the imaginary
property to paint the surfaces it intersects with its local gray level. For easy
description let us also assume that we use a binary version of the GRHD, that
is, we use the approximation that the sine wave of light is just a square wave
that has one half in antiphase with the other. Then, when the GRHD cuts
any arbitrary shaped surface Σ, limiting the media with the refractive indices
used in its calculation, a series of painted and transparent regions are deﬁned
on the surface. If the so painted Σ surface is now illuminated by a point source
at F it will be transmitted only in the transparent regions. That is to say that
only points fulﬁlling the condition that the sum of the optical paths between
F and tha wave front W diﬀer in integer multiples of λ, will contribute to the
transmitted wave front. The painted surface behaves as a hologram that when
illuminated by a wave front coming from F diﬀracts a wave front congruent
with W and conversely. We can say then that such a cut is a Generalized
Fresnel Zone Plate.

It can be easily seen that, if the refracting surface is itself a refracting proﬁle,
then the Fresnel Zone plate is not needed: the surface is uniformly transpar-
ent. Then, if a certain refracting surface shape is close to that of a refracting
proﬁle, this Fresnel Zone plate or hologram will show extensive uniform re-
gions. This means that the Fresnel Zone plate so generated can be used to
correct construction phase errors in a refracting proﬁle and it will consist in a
low spatial frequency register.

Finally we will give another optical application of the refracting proﬁles con-
struction: As, when the incident wave front is W , after refraction in the pro-
ﬁle the wave front is spherical converging to or diverging from F , the second
medium can be ﬁnished as a spherical surface centered in F (8) followed by
the same refracting medium with index n1 or any other. Then, the focusing
proﬁle becomes a lens that either selectively focuses a given wave front W
or synthesizes from F a predetermined wave front W in the same medium.
As shown in reference (9), the second surface ﬁnishing needs not to be exclu-
sively spherical but can also be in the shape of a Cartesian oval. Moreover,
as the refracted wave front is spherical converging to F , the same concept
described here permits to design the second surface as a second refracting
proﬁle. The composite eﬀect of the two cascaded refracting proﬁles acts then
as a particular lens that maps a predetermined wave front W1 into another
also predetermined wave front W2 after two refractions.

Conversely, a spherical wave front, either diverging from or converging to a
point F , can be mapped with a refracting proﬁle into another wave front and
the latter again mapped after a second refraction to a diverging or converging
wave front with the same or other focus F . The composite eﬀect is that of a

10

sort of lens that conjugates a point source to the ﬁnal focus with an encryption
step between. The generalization of the HD to two more arbitrary wave fronts
will be treated in a forthcoming work.

5 Conclusions

We have proposed a generalization of the classical concept of Holodiagram
with respect to one wave front. It is based on the concepts of refracting and
focusing proﬁles recently developed. Regions corresponding to caustics and
auto intersections need to be excluded. We have shown some characteristic
examples.

The use of the new compound concept can be found not only in getting insight
about wave front propagation but also in the design of computer generated
holograms to synthesize predetermined wave fronts, in pattern recognition of
speciﬁed wave fronts, in the mapping of a wave front into another, in the cal-
culation of tolerances in special lenses construction, in elementary ray tracing,
encryption, etc.

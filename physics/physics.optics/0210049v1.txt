Abstract

An analytical model is presented for a rectangular lattice of isotropic scatterers

with electric and magnetic resonances. Each isotropic scatterer is formed by

putting appropriately 6 Ω-shaped perfectly conducting particles on the faces

of a cubic unit cell. A self-consistent dispersion equation is derived and then

used to calculate correctly the eﬀective permittivity and permeability in the

frequency band where the lattice can be homogenized. The frequency range in

which both the eﬀective permittivity and permeability are negative corresponds

to the mini-band of backward waves within the resonant band of the individual

isotropic scatterer.

1 Introduction

In 1967 Veselago considered an isotropic continuous medium with both negative

permittivity and negative permeability and proved that a negative refraction

would occur when a monochromatic wave impinges on the surface of such a

medium [1]. As a result he obtained theoretically a quasi-lens (the lens does not

focus parallel rays) from a slab of such a hypothetic material. In the Veselago

theory this quasi-lens must form an image of any source without distortion (since

each interface is a parallel plate). The phase of the radiated ﬁeld at the focal

point should be the same as the phase of the source dipole. These results are the

consequences of backward waves in such a medium. The phase velocity and the

Pointing vector are in opposite direction for a backward wave. In 2000 Pendry

claimed that the Veselago quasi-lens must possess an extraordinary property

to amplify and focus the evanescent waves in the spatial spectrum of a point

source and therefore this lens must be perfect [2]. Since then much attention

has been attracted to this research area both theoretically and experimentally

(see e.g. [3]

[7]). Such negative media do not exist in nature but have already

−

got diﬀerent names in the literature such as backward-wave media, the Veselago

media, left-handed media and negative meta-materials. Since it is not clear yet

how to make such media in the optical range of frequencies, the experimental ef-

forts have been concentrated on creating negative meta-materials at microwave

frequencies. A structure allowing the propagation of backward waves within a

certain frequency band has been suggested in [4] and then experimentally stud-

ied in [3], where the negative refraction phenomenon was primarily observed.

However, the structure of [4] (a combination of two lattices: a lattice of in-

ﬁnitely long parallel wires and a lattice of the so-called split-ring resonators) is

not isotropic. This structure can be described with negative permittivity and

permeability only if the propagation direction is orthogonal to the axes of wires

[5].

To the best of our knowledge, the only isotropic medium with possible neg-

ative permittivity and permeability (within a certain frequency band) that has

been reported is formed by many isotropic cubic cells of Ω particles [6]. Each

isotropic cubic cell is made by putting 6 Ω-shaped perfectly conducting particles

3

on its faces (as shown in Fig. 1). Fig. 1 shows how to make an isotropic unit

cell by putting successively 3 pairs of Ω-particles on the opposite faces of a cubic

unit cell in an appropriate way. Then each cubic cell can be described approx-

imately as an isotropic resonant scatterer. The frequencies at which both the

eﬀective permittivity and permeability of such a composite medium are negative

are within the resonant band of each individual isotropic scatterer. Note that

conducting Ω-particles were ﬁrst suggested in [8] for creating the bianisotropic

composites.

In the present paper we consider a negative meta-material formed by a rect-

angular lattice of isotropic cubic unit cells of Ω particles (as shown in Fig. 1).

We introduce an analytical model to describe the dispersion properties of the

lattice and calculate correctly the eﬀective permittivity ǫef f (ω) and permeabil-

ity µef f (ω) in the frequency band where the lattice can be homogenized. We

compare the results obtained by the present model with the previous results

obtained by the Maxwell Garnett model, and show that the latter can not give

reliable values for either the real parts or the imaginary parts of the eﬀective

material parameters µef f and ǫef f .

From the negative dispersion of the lattice at low frequencies we obtain the

frequency range of backward waves within the resonant band of the isotropic

scatterers. In this frequency range the phase velocity is in an opposite direction

of the group velocity. Our calculations show that this backward wave range is

exactly the same as the frequency range within which both ǫef f and µef f are

negative.

The case when the lattice is formed by many parallel bianisotropic Ω-particles

is also considered in an appendix. It is shown that the bianisotropy of the lattice

particles reduces the possibility for the existence of backward waves.

2 Polarizability of an isotropic cubic unit cell

For bianisotropic particles (a Ω-particle is a special case), one has the following

four dyadic polarizability matrices relating the electric dipole moment p and

4

the magnetic dipole moment m with the local electric and magnetic ﬁelds:

p = aee

·
m = ame

Eloc + aem

·
Eloc + amm

·

For reciprocal particles, one has ame =

a

quite diﬀerent. The bianisotropy cancels out since e.g. each pair of opposite

Ω particles shown in Fig. 1 have equal absolute value but opposite sign for

aem. The polarizabilities aee and amm of a cubic unit cell of 6 Ω-particles

(see Fig. 1) are the sums of the polarizabilities a

Ω
mm for individual
particles [6]. The inﬂuence of the mutual coupling of the particles is small and

Ω
ee and a

the resonant frequency for such a cubic unit cell of 6 Ω-particles has only a

small shift from that for an isolated Ω-particle. The resonant excitation by an

electric ﬁeld directed along the arms of Ω particles is mainly due to the presence

of the arms. The resonant behavior retains for the total electric polarization of

the two opposite omega particles. Within the resonant band, the quasi-static
polarizability component azzΩ

(which describes the response of the particle to

ee

an electric ﬁeld normal to the direction of the arms; see Fig. 1(a)) of the Ω
particle is small as compared to ayyΩ
considered as an isotropic scatterer and thus one has axx
and axx

ee . Such a cubic unit cell can be therefore
ee = aee

ee = ayy
mm = amm [6]. One can easily show that [6]

mm = ayy

mm = azz

ee = azz

(3)

The expressions for the parameters axxΩ

mm have been given in [9]. In
the present paper we consider a material formed by a rectangular lattice of such

and ayyΩ

ee

scatterers (see Fig. 1(b)).

The electric and magnetic polarizabilities for a cubic cell of Ω-particles are

calculated (cf. [6]) and shown in Fig. 2 as a numerical example. The geometric

parameters for the Ω-particles are chosen as r = 1.5 mm, w = 0.4 mm, h = 0.2

mm and l = 2 mm (see Fig. 1(a)). The size of the cubic unit cell is 4 mm.

The relative permittivity for the background medium is chosen as ǫb = 1.5 (the

permeability of the background medium is assumed be the same as the one for

5

vacuum in the present paper). Resonances of aee and amm (frequencies at which

the real parts of these parameters become zero) occur at the frequency of 8.05
GHz and 8.14 GHz, respectively. We have chosen the time dependence ejωt, and

thus the imaginary parts of these parameters are negative. Below we consider

a material formed by a rectangular lattice of such isotropic scatterers (see Fig.

1(b)).

In the Maxwell Garnett model, one only needs to know the scatterer polar-

izabilities and the density N of the scatterers. Thus the obtained result for a

regular lattice of scatterers will be the same as that for a random distribution

of scatterers if the density of the scatterers is the same. For the case considered

in the present paper (i.e., a rectangular lattice of isotropic cubic unit cells as

shown in Fig. 1(b) with periods dx, dy, dz along the Cartesian axes), one has

N = 1/dxdydz. The frequency dependencies of ǫef f and µef f predicted by the

Maxwell Garnett model are shown in Fig. 3 when dx = dy = dz = d = 8 mm
3). From this ﬁgure one sees that both Re(µeﬀ ) and
(i.e. N = (1/83)

9 m−

10−

Re(ǫeﬀ) are negative within a certain frequency band (8.34

8.62 GHz). How-

−

ever, within this frequency band the imaginary parts of µeﬀ and ǫeﬀ have high

values (about

4

6). The radiation losses are so large that the obtained

·

−

∼ −

negative eﬀective permittivity ǫef f and permeability µef f have no practical im-

portance for applications.

6

The above results predicted by the Maxwell Garnett model (in [6] for a

random arrangement of cubic unit cells) are not correct for the present case of

the regular lattice. Within the resonant band (7.6-8.6 GHz) of each Ω-particle,

the wavelength (λ = 28

33 mm) in the background medium (ǫb = 1.5) is

−

much larger than the distance d (8 mm) between the isotropic cubic scatterers,

and this distance is larger than the size (4 mm) of each scatterer. From this

point of view one may expect that the homogenization is possible. However,

the results predicted by the Maxwell Garnett model are inconsistent near the

resonance of the scatterer. The Maxwell Garnett model is based on the Clausius-

Mossotti relations for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. These relations for cubic

lattices of static dipoles have been found as good approximations in the works

of Sivukhin [10] (for an inﬁnite lattice and for a half-space) and McPhedran [11]

(for arrays of ﬁnite sizes). The Clausius-Mossotti relations were also conﬁrmed

to be accurate enough for cubic lattices of dipoles in a time-harmonic case [12]

under the condition that the wavelength is large compared to the lattice period

d. However, the resonant case is not considered in these works. In the resonant

case, the Maxwell Garnett model may give very high absolute values for the

real parts of ǫef f and µef f within the resonant band, and this would lead to

a dramatic shortening of the wavelength in the homogenized medium. The

wavelength in the homogenized medium becomes comparable with the particle

distance d and thus the Maxwell Garnett model becomes contradictory at some

frequencies.

In the present case (see Fig. 3) the absolute values of real parts of ǫef f

and µef f are so high within the narrow band 8.37-8.40 GHz where the Maxwell

Garnett model becomes contradictory. Outside this narrow band

Re(ǫef f )
|
|

and

are not very high. However, the inconsistency of the Maxwell Garnett

Re(µef f )
|
|
model for the present case of regular lattice is evident over the whole resonant

band of Ω-particles (8.1-8.5 GHz). In Fig. 3 one can see that the imaginary

parts of ǫef f and µef f are rather signiﬁcant at those frequencies. On the other

hand, we know that Im(µeﬀ ) and Im(ǫeﬀ) must be identically zeros physically if

the lossless scatterers are arranged in a regular lattice. The cancelation of the

radiation resistances of the scatterers (due to their electromagnetic interaction)

7

is obvious for an inﬁnite regular array and thus there is no radiation loss at all

(see e.g. [13]).

In the present paper, we introduce another homogenization model which

gives correctly zero value for the imaginary parts of ǫef f and µef f . A com-

parison in Section 5 will show that the real parts of ǫef f and µef f predicted

by the Maxwell Garnett model are also wrong within the resonant band of the

scatterers.

scatterers

4 Dispersion equation for the lattice of the isotropic

Consider the rectangular lattice of the isotropic scatterers (shown in Fig. 1) with

periods dx, dy along the x and y axes and dz = d along the z axis. In the present

case, the electric dipole moment is orthogonal to the magnetic dipole moment

for each scatterer. Let p and m denote the dipole moments of a reference

scatterer located at the origin. Thus one has

p = aeeEloc,

m = ammHloc.

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

We need to ﬁnd the eigenmodes for such a lattice of isotropic scatterers. Assume

the wave propagates along the z-axis. Let β denote the propagation constant

of an eigenmode. The ﬁrst Brillouin zone is the interval 0

βd

π. Then

≤

≤

p(nx, ny, nz) and m(nx, ny, nz) (the electric and magnetic dipole moments of

a scatterer located at a lattice node with coordinates x = nxdx, y = nydy, z =

nzd) can be expressed through p and m (for the reference scatterer) as

p(nx, ny, nz) = pe−

jnzβd,

m(nx, ny, nz) = me−

jnzβd.

Since eigenwaves are linearly polarized in the present case, we can assume

without loss of generality that p = px0 and m = my0 (see also Fig. 1). Then

the local electric and magnetic ﬁelds are directed along the x and y directions,

respectively (the local ﬁeld has the same polarization as the eigenmode). This

8

allows the following scalar expressions for the local ﬁeld amplitudes in terms of

p and m:

Eloc = Ap + Bm,

H loc = Cm + Dp,

where A, B, C, D are the so-called interaction factors of the lattice, which depend

only on the lattice geometry, the frequency ω and the propagation factor β (they

do not depend on the polarizabilities of the scatterers). From the reciprocity

it follows that B = D. From the duality it follows that C = A/η2, where

η =

µ0/ǫbǫ0 is the wave impedance of the background medium.

From Eqs. (6),(7), (10) and (11), one obtains the following two important

This root is β that we show in our dispersion plots below. The other root does

not satisfy the above condition and thus is spurious.

Fig. 4 shows the dispersion for the same cubic lattice of isotropic scatterers

as used for Fig. 3. From this ﬁgure one can see that there is a band (between 8.14

and 8.37 GHz) in which the group velocity is negative. This is the backward-

wave band. Since the Poynting vector in a lossless medium must be directed

along the group velocity, this band corresponds to the case when the energy

transports oppositely to the phase. Of course, this situation would be trivial

for some high-frequency dispersion branches. For a lattice of dipoles, negative

dispersion is inherent for every even dispersion branch (π(2n+1) < kd < π2(n+

1)π, where n = 0, 1, 2 . . .). However, only in the ﬁrst frequency zone (where

0 < kd < π) the lattice period is smaller than λ/2 (half of the wavelength in

the background medium) and thus the homogenization of the lattice is possible.

Only if the lattice of scatterers can be homogenized, the material parameters

ǫef f and µef f can be introduced and the lattice of scatterers can be interpreted

as a continuous medium.

It the Veselago theory [1] the backward wave in

a continuous medium should correspond to a case when both ǫef f and µef f

are negative. The negative dispersion in the homogenized structure implies

the backward wave and therefore our ǫef f and µef f should be negative if the

Veselago theory is applicable for dispersive media.

Fig. 5 gives an enlarged view of Fig. 4 for the frequency dependence of

Reβ and Imβ in the frequency range 7-10 GHz. From this ﬁgure one sees that

there are two stopbands within the resonant band of each scatterer (cf. Fig.

2). The lower one (stopband 1) is very narrow (8.06-8.14 GHz), and the higher

(stopband 2) is wider (8.37-8.52 GHz). Between these two stopbands there is the

band of backward waves. Stopband 2 is a conventional lattice stopband which

has Reβ = 0. Stopband 1 corresponds to the so-called complex mode which is

known in the theory for lattices of inﬁnite wires (see e.g. [17],[18]). This complex

mode is decaying and the real part of the propagation factor is identically equal

to π/d. In our case, the relation Reβ = π/d reﬂects the fact that the directions

of the dipole moments of the scatterers are alternating along the propagation

axis (i.e., two adjacent isotropic scatterers have opposite polarizations).

Here amm is a function of ω for given geometrical parameters of scatterers and

given ǫb. Since the frequency dependence of β(ω) is known from the solution

of the dispersion equation (24), the frequency dependence of α(ω) can be cal-

culated from the above equation. In the next section we will use this frequency

dependence of α(ω) to ﬁnd the explicit expressions for the eﬀective material

parameters ǫef f (ω) and µef f (ω) of the homogenized lattice.

Our calculations show that α is also a crucial parameter for the frequency

bounds of the backward-wave range. The central frequencies of both stopbands

are frequencies at which α(ω) changes the sign. It is positive below 8.1 GHz,

negative in 8.1-8.45 GHz (backward-wave range) and positive again above 8.45

GHz. Both stopbands are centered by the 2 zero-points of α(ω). Of course,

both stopbands are within the resonant band of each isotropic scatterer.

5 Homogenization of the lattice of the isotropic

scatterers

Consider the frequency band 0 < kd

π within which homogenization is pos-

≤
sible and eﬀective parameters ǫef f and µef f can be, perhaps, introduced. To

determine the frequency dependence of the two parameters ǫef f (ω) and µef f (ω),

we needs to ﬁnd two relations (involving the propagation constant β(ω)) between

these two parameters. The ﬁrst relation can be obtained by ﬁtting the value

β/k with the eﬀective refraction index nef f = √ǫef f µef f , i.e., one has

µef f =

β2
k2ǫef f

.

(26)

Note that k is proportional to ω (i.e., k = ω√ǫ0µ0ǫb) and β = β(ω) is given by

the dispersion curve calculated in the previous section.

To ﬁnd another relation, we deﬁne the following averaged (over a cubic unit

13

cell) electric and magnetic polarizations per unit volume:

P =

p
V

,

M =

m
V

,

where V = d3 (in this section we assume that the lattice periods are the same

in all the three directions, i.e., dx = dy = dz = d; otherwise the lattice will be

anisotropic). In the same way we can introduce the following averaged electric

and magnetic ﬁelds,

< E >=

EdV,

< H >=

HdV.

Since the material considered here is isotropic, its wave impedance Z can be

expressed as the ratio < E > / < H >, i.e.,

(27)

If we use the conventional expression Z =

, the square root can be

µ0µef f

chosen either positive (in the range of forward waves) or negative (in the range

of backward waves; the ratio µef f /ǫef f is always positive). For a backward wave

in a continuous isotropic medium, the vectors < E >= Ex0 and < H >= Hy0

form a left-hand triad with the wave vector K = βz0 [1], and thus the wave

impedance should be negative. Substituting (26) into Z =

The above expression is more convenient for use since it gives automatically a

negative impedance for a backward wave (when ǫef f < 0).

From the deﬁnitions for the eﬀective material parameters, one has

ǫ0ǫef f < E >= ǫ0ǫb < E > +P,

µ0µef f < H >= µ0 < H > +M.

Using Eqs. (27) and (28) and taking into account the above relations, one can

express the dimensionless parameter α = ηP/M (determined by Eq. (25)) as

The above equation gives the second required relation between the two eﬀective

Note that k = ω√ǫ0µ0ǫb and α = α(ω) is given by formula (25). After ǫef f (ω)

is calculated, µef f (ω) is then calculated from Eq. (26).

Fig. 6 shows the eﬀective permittivity and permeability for the same lattice

of isotropic scatterers as used before in Figs. 3

5. From this ﬁgure one sees

−

that both ǫef f and µef f are negative in the band of backward waves. This is

consistent to the Veselago theory.

In any of the two stopbands, the value β contains non-zero imaginary part

and thus Eqs. (30) and (26) give complex values for ǫef f and µef f at these

frequencies. Since the structure is lossless, ǫef f and µef f must be real at the

frequencies for which the homogenization is possible. Therefore, we can conclude

that the homogenization can not be performed within the stopbands. That’s

why in Fig. 6 no value is given for ǫef f or µef f in the stopbands. From Fig.

6 one sees that outside the two stopbands the absolute values of ǫef f and µef f

are not very high. The wavelength in the homogenized medium (which is equal

to 2π/β) is not dramatically shortened within the passbands (in which βd <

π). This indicates that the present homogenization model is self-consistent

(unlike expressions (4) and (5) derived from the Maxwell Garnett model). By

comparison Fig. 6 with Fig. 3, we can conclude that for a lattice of resonant

particles the Maxwell Garnett model can not give reliable values for either the

real parts or the imaginary parts for the eﬀective material parameters (µef f ) and

(ǫef f ). The Maxwell Garnett model can only predicts qualitatively the location

of the frequency band where the eﬀective permittivity and permeability have

negative real parts.

6 Conclusion

In the present paper, we have presented an analytical model for an isotropic

negative meta-material, which is formed by a rectangular lattice of isotropic

scatterers with electric and magnetic resonances. Each isotropic scatterer is

formed by putting 3 pairs of Ω-particles on the opposite faces of a cubic unit cell

in an appropriate way. We have derived a self-consistent dispersion equation and

studied the dispersion properties of the lattice. The obtained dispersion curves

are then used to calculate correctly the eﬀective permittivity and permeability

in the frequency band where the lattice can be homogenized. It is interesting

to see that the dispersion curves agree well with the Veselago theory which

predicts backward waves when both permittivity and permeability are negative.

The Veselago theory is non-complete (it was only for monochromatic waves and

did not take into account the dispersion of the medium) and some questions are

left open. It has been shown in the present paper that the frequency range in

which both the eﬀective permittivity and permeability are negative corresponds

to the mini-band of negative dispersion of the lattice at low frequencies within

the resonant band of the individual isotropic scatterer. It has been shown that

the frequency range of backward waves is determined by the edges of the two

stopbands at low frequencies. We have compared the results obtained by the

present model with the previous results obtained by the Maxwell Garnett model,

and shown that the latter can not give reliable values for either the real part

or the imaginary part for any eﬀective material parameter (µef f or ǫef f ) of the

lattice. For lattices of resonant scatterers, the Maxwell Garnett model can only

predict approximately the location of the frequency band where the eﬀective

permittivity and permeability have negative real parts.

The case when the lattice is formed by parallel bianisotropic Ω-particles has

also been studied (in the appendix). It has been shown that the bianisotropy

of the lattice particles suppresses those terms in the dispersion equation that

can allow a backward wave propagation and thus reduces the possibility for the

existence of backward waves. Therefore, the present formulas for calculating

correctly ǫef f and µef f for the negative meta-material from resonant isotropic

scatterers (the only isotropic negative meta-material that we know) is of impor-

16

tance.

Appendix: The case of a lattice of bianisotropic
particles

In this appendix, we present brieﬂy our studies for the case when the lattice is

formed by an inﬁnite number of parallel Ω-particles. We also explain why the

magnetoelectric coupling of these bianisotropic particles reduce the possibility

for the existence of backward waves.

We use a simpliﬁed wire-and-loop model for each Ω-particle, in which we

assume that the current ﬂowing around the loop is uniform (i.e., the electric

polarization of the loop is neglected).

If the particle is excited by a x-directed electric ﬁeld Eloc (see Fig. 1), then

the current in the loop and the straight wire arms will be equal to the induced

voltage in the straight wire portion divided by the impedance for the series

connection of the loop impedance Zl and the straight wire impedance Zw, i.e.,

Thus one obtains the following electric and magnetoelectric polarizabilities,

where S = πr2 is the loop area.

Now let the particle be excited by a y-directed local magnetic ﬁeld H loc. An

electromotive force (i.e., voltage

) is induced in the loop, and one has

Thus, one has electromagnetic and magnetic polarizabilities

From the above expressions for the polarizabilities, the following identities

can be obtained:

The second identity is due to the reciprocity property of the particle. For such

a bianisotropic particle (local electric ﬁeld is x-polarized and magnetic ﬁeld is

y

polarized), we have (cf. Eqs. (6) and (7))

In the rectangular lattice of parallel Ω-particles, the electric dipole moment of

each particle is directed along the x-axis and the magnetic dipole moment is

directed along the y-axis when the eigenmode with E = Ex0 and H = Hy0

propagates along the z

axis (the local ﬁeld has the same polarization as the

−

eigenmode). Substituting relations (10) and (11) into Eqs. (A3) and (A4), one

For a bianisotropic particle, Eq. (16) is generalized to the following relation

(A7) and using Eq.

Eq. (A9) has the same form as the classical dispersion equation for a periodically

loaded line [20]), which is also known as the Kronig-Pennie equation in the solid-

state physics. In the known cases described by this equation (see e.g. [20]) the

negative dispersion exists only within the even zones of frequencies (2πn < kd <

π(2n + 1), n = 1, 2, 3, ...). We did not ﬁnd any physically realizable Ω-particle

for which the above dispersion relation would give a negative dispersion within

the ﬁrst frequency zone (0 < kd < π).

In the above analysis, the model for the Ω-particle is rough (since the electric

polarization of the loop is neglected) and identity (A1) is approximate. We have

studied the lattice of parallel Ω-particles using a more accurate model (as used

in [9]). This accurate model leads to another dispersion equation (diﬀerent

from Eq.

(A9)) which is quadratic with respect to cos βd and contains the

electromagnetic interaction factor D. Again, we did not ﬁnd any physically

realizable Ω-particle for which this dispersion relation would give a negative

dispersion within the ﬁrst frequency zone (0 < kd < π). The error in Eq. (A1)

for real Ω

particles is quite small and the terms containing D in this dispersion

−

equation are relatively small. Neglecting these small terms and removing the

spurious root, we obtained the same result as what Eq. (A9) leads to.

19

Therefore, we can conclude that the bianisotropy of the lattice particles sup-

presses those terms in the dispersion equation that can allow a backward wave

propagation at low frequencies. The possibility for the existence of backward

waves is thus reduced (it was reported with another reason in [21] that the

bianisotropy is not good for the existence of backward waves).

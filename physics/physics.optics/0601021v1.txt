ABSTRACT

Polarization-resolved second-harmonic spectra are obtained from the resonant modes of a two-dimensional planar
photonic crystal microcavity patterned in a free-standing InP slab. The photonic crystal microcavity is comprised
of a single missing-hole defect in a hexagonal photonic crystal host formed with elliptically-shaped holes. The
cavity supports two orthogonally-polarized resonant modes split by 60 cm−1. Sum-frequency data are reported
from the nonlinear interaction of the two coherently excited modes, and the polarization dependence is explained
in terms of the nonlinear susceptibility tensor of the host InP.

1. INTRODUCTION

Planar photonic crystals (PPCs) are ideal platforms to host engineered optical microcavities for the study of light-
matter interactions in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum information research. Although
the Q-factors of PPC microcavities have typically been much lower than the Fabry-Perot cavities used in the
pioneering cavity QED work,1, 2 in the last three years innovative momentum-space3, 4 and double heterostructure
designs have realized Q-factors as large as 600,000. Moreover, PPC microcavities have three distinct advantages
over their macroscopic counterparts: they provide mode volumes which approach the fundamental limit of a
cubic half-wavelength in material; they allow integration with quantum dots to control the exciton/photon
coupling; and they are based on the mature fabrication technology of e-beam lithography and plasma-etching,
which facilitates higher-scale integration and coupling to waveguides. In a quantum information context, PPC
microcavities that incorporate artiﬁcial quantum dots can be conﬁgured in diﬀerent ways to act as single photon
sources,5 or “qubits”, the basic building blocks of quantum computers. For example, the two states that comprise
the qubit could be two high-Q photon modes of a microcavity that are coupled through a nonlinearity,6 or two
quantum dots that are coupled by a single cavity mode.7

We recently reported a novel resonant scattering technique that probes coherently excited resonant modes of
PPC microcavities eﬃciently and independently of the photoluminescence (PL) from embedded quantum dots.8
The data were from single-missing hole defect cavities that supported two non-degenerate modes, each with a
Q of about 500. We also reported an example of the spectra emitted from such modes at approximately twice
the frequency of the broadband pulse that resonantly excited both cavity modes. Four distinct features were
identiﬁed: three centered at twice the frequencies of the excitation pulse and the two cavity modes, and one
centered at the sum of the two distinct cavity mode frequencies. In this paper, the polarization dependence of
these harmonic features is explored and interpreted in terms of the nonlinear susceptibility tensor of the host
InP. The data can be explained principally in the context of the bulk ¯43m χ(2) tensor, although there may be
additional surface eﬀects arising from the broken symmetry around the air holes that deﬁne the PPC microcavity.
Since the sum-frequency signal can only be generated when both cavity modes are excited, this oﬀers a means of
monitoring the occupation of the cavity modes in a weakly invasive manner. These results also suggest that the
inverse nonlinear process, whereby a single photon at the sum-frequency generates two photons in the microcavity
modes, might allow these to act as miniature sources of correlated photon pairs.

2. EXPERIMENT

The microcavity is deﬁned in a 2D pattern of air holes in a 223 nm free-standing layer of InP separated by 1 µm
from a glass substrate. A single layer of InAs quantum dots at a relatively low density of 1-2 µm−2 is contained
in the middle of the InP membrane. The cavity-enhanced PL from the quantum dots was reported previously.8, 9
Further details about the sample fabrication can be found in Dalacu et al.9

The harmonic spectroscopy is performed in tandem with resonant scattering, as shown in the experimental
set-up in Figure 1. In both techniques, a Spectra-Physics optical parametric oscillator (OPO) tuned near 1580
nm is used to generate 100 fs pulses at a repetition rate of 80 MHz. The desired excitation polarization is
selected using a half-wave plate and polarizer, and the light is tightly focused by a 100x microscope objective.
It is collected in transmission using a 40x microscope objective (NA 0.55). With the input lens defocused, the
PPC outline can be clearly imaged on a camera placed after the collection lens, and the beam focussed down to
the missing-hole defect cavity. The resonant scattering signal, which has excellent signal-to-noise and is rapid
to acquire with a Bomem Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, is used to align the cavity for the
harmonic spectroscopy. By optimizing this signal, the position of the sample, which is mounted on Melles Griot
nanopositioners, can be adjusted to high precision to eﬀectively excite each mode separately, or both modes,
depending on the incident polarization.

To acquire the second-harmonic data, average excitation powers of 70-110 µW are used, and the signal is
directed to a grating spectrometer and cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) detector by removing the ﬁnal turning
mirror. The only adjustment to the detection scheme is that the collection lens must be translated about 50
µm towards the sample to account for the chromatic dispersion between the fundamental and second-harmonic
frequencies.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To interpret the microcavity results, it is ﬁrst necessary to understand the “bulk” membrane response. Away
from the patterned regions, the InP membrane is not free-standing, but is supported by a 1 µm layer of SiO2,
which is glued with optical adhesive to a thick glass substrate. The second-harmonic response of the untextured,
supported membrane was probed in each of four incident polarizations: 0◦, 45◦, 90◦, and 135◦. The y/x
electronic axes of the InP are aligned with the 45◦/135◦ polarizations, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2a. The
detected intensity as a function of output polarization is shown in Figure 2b. Virtually identical results were
obtained from a sample of similar dimensions which did not contain a dilute layer of InAs quantum dots. The
45◦ and 135◦ data peak when the output signal is cross-polarized with respect to the input, and have a null in

oﬀset in cross-polarization.

The bulk nonlinear susceptibility tensor for InP, a zincblende (¯43m) crystal, has only three non-vanishing
components: χ(2)
ijk, i 6= j 6= k. In order to generate second-harmonic radiation from the bulk when the excitation
beam is polarized parallel to either the x- or y-electronic axis, there must be a ˆz-component of the ﬁeld, and such
radiation would be cross-polarized with respect to the input, as observed in the data. The existence of longitudinal
(ˆz) ﬁelds is well known for tightly focussed Gaussian beams,10–12 for which the paraxial approximation breaks
down. Near the beam waist, it can be shown that Ez ∝ xEx,10 so the longitudinal ﬁeld is anti-symmetric about
the y-z mirror plane. In our experiment, we estimate the beam waist radius to wavelength ratio (w0/λ) to be
about 1, and ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) simulations (Lumerical Solutions) show that the maximum
of |Ez| is on the order of 6% of the transverse ﬁeld magnitude |Ex| in this case. Because of the odd symmetry
of Ez, the second-harmonic polarization which is generated will be of opposite sign on either side of the beam
centre. Using FDTD, this situation can be modelled as two oppositely-oriented, in-plane dipoles separated by
about 1.5 µm. The results conﬁrm that there is a non-trivial far-ﬁeld radiation pattern generated, and that
the magnitude of the radiation within the solid angle seen by the collection lens is consistent with the observed
signal.

For 0◦ and 90◦ incident polarizations, both ˆx- and ˆy-polarizations are excited in the InP slab. The large
signal in the parallel orientation and non-zero signal in the crossed orientation are consistent with the bulk χ(2)
response in which the three non-vanishing tensor elements are equal in magnitude. The second-order polarization
generated with these incident polarizations can be expressed as ~P ∝ χ(2)
zxyExEy ˆz.
When the incident ﬁeld is oriented at θ = 0◦, Ex = Ey, and the in-plane component of the polarization will
then be oriented parallel or anti-parallel to the incident ﬁeld, depending on the orientation of Ez. The resulting
second-order ﬁeld radiated by the in-plane components of the polarization will thus be oriented parallel to the
incident ﬁeld. There will also be a ˆz-oriented dipole that radiates with no preferred polarization, which explains
the non-zero background in this polarization conﬁguration.

which has symmetry 4mm, the non-zero surface symmetry susceptibility elements are χzzz, χzii, and χizi, where
i = x, y. The latter element would give rise to radiation polarized parallel to the excitation ﬁeld. However, the
45◦ and 135◦ data show a nearly complete null in the parallel polarization, indicating little sensitivity to surface
eﬀects in the normal incidence geometry of this experiment.

3.2. Microcavity harmonic spectroscopy

With the laser focused on the microcavity by optimizing on the modes observed in resonant scattering, second-
harmonic data were acquired at the same four input polarizations as for the unpatterned region. At the 45◦
and 135◦ polarizations, where the laser is approximately aligned with one of the cavity modes, there are two
features: a broad peak which corresponds to the second-harmonic of the laser spectrum, and a sharp feature
at the second-harmonic frequency of the lower energy resonant mode. The picture is more complicated when
the laser is polarized at 0◦ or 90◦. The spectra exhibit features due to the second-harmonic of each mode,
the sum-frequency generation from the mixing of the two modes, and the broad second-harmonic of the laser
spectrum. The 90◦ polarization-resolved data are shown in Figure 3 (the 0◦ spectra are similar).

Figure 3. Harmonic spectra with the laser excitation polarized at 90
, which excites both cavity modes. The output
polarization is indicated at the right of each trace. There are SHG features from both modes and the laser, and a
sum-frequency peak from the nonlinear mixing of the two modes.

Unlike the PL spectroscopy, which imparts no coherent relation between the two modes; resonant, short-pulse
excitation enforces well-deﬁned amplitude and phase relations between the modes and the laser ﬁelds. In the
linear resonant scattering experiment,8 this was shown to lead to a π phase shift between the modes, as detected
in the crossed polarization. In the present context, the data are therefore ﬁt using the square of a coherent sum
of three Lorentzians and a laser lineshape function.

The observation of strong SHG signals from the individual modes, polarized parallel to the mode polarization,
cannot be explained using a bulk second-order polarizability. Because the modes are TE-like, they are symmetric
about the mirror plane in the middle of the waveguide, and so there should be considerable cancellation (from
the top and bottom halves of the slab) due to polarizations derived from the tensor elements χ(2)
yxz. Also,
because the individual modes are approximately aligned along the electronic axes of the InP, their self-interaction
through the χ(2)
zxy tensor element should be negligible, and even if such a second-order polarization were generated,
it would not be polarized parallel to the mode polarization (as in the data). The SHG signals observed from the
individual modes are therefore attributed to a second-order polarization generated in the vicinity of the etched
holes, where the bulk symmetry is likely not applicable.

xyz or χ(2)

The experiment has been modelled by an FDTD simulation for a cavity with elliptical holes oriented at an
angle of 45◦, for which the semi-major axis is 40 nm longer than the semi-minor axis, which is consistent with
scanning electron microscope images of the sample. The results give two dipole-like microcavity modes split by
about 38 cm−1, and polarized at approximately 135◦ (mode 1) and 45◦ (mode 2). Although the experimental
splitting is larger, the simulation qualitatively captures the observed mode orientation. Vector ﬁeld plots for
the two modes superimposed on a schematic of the cavity geometry are shown in Figure 4. From these plots
it is clear that considerable ﬁeld intensity is localized near the air holes, and so it is possible that new tensor
components due to surface eﬀects may be responsible for the generation of the SHG signal from the individual
modes, and also for their anomalous polarization dependencies.

Figure 5. Sum-frequency amplitude for the 90
input polarization data. The error bars are derived from the standard
deviations extracted from the ﬁt results. The non-zero oﬀset arises from a ˆz-polarization generated from the nonlinear
mixing of the two microcavity modes with a bulk χ(2) symmetry.

The polarization dependence of the sum-frequency signal is shown in Fig. 5, where the amplitude and standard
deviations have been extracted from the nonlinear least-squares ﬁt. We believe that the non-zero oﬀset indicates
a signiﬁcant component of the radiation derives from a nonlinear electronic polarization in the InP which lies
along the optic (ˆz) axis. This “intrinsic” response is consistent with the orthogonally-oriented modes interacting
through the χ(2)
zxy component of the bulk nonlinear susceptibility to produce a ˆz-polarization in the sample. The
modulation in the signal, which is also signiﬁcant, is likely an “extrinsic” eﬀect associated with ﬁelds localized
near the surfaces of the etched holes, as discussed earlier.

To explain why the bulk χ(2) properties seem to play an important role in the sum-frequency mixing of
the two modes, the spatial dependence of the sum-frequency polarization, Pz(ω1 + ω2, ~r), can be reconstructed
from the FDTD simulation, as shown in Fig. 6.
In the limit that the modes are spectrally well-separated
and can be represented by harmonic amplitudes, the sum-frequency polarization is given by Pz(ω1 + ω2, ~r) =
ǫ0χ(2)
zxy(Ex(ω1, ~r)Ey(ω2, ~r) + Ey(ω1, ~r)Ex(ω2, ~r)). The image in Fig. 6 shows that the sum-frequency polarization
derived in this manner is localized predominantly at the center of the cavity, where the bulk nonlinear response
would be expected to dominate, based on the oﬀ-pattern results discussed above.

Finally, a quantitative check on this picture is provided by simulating the radiated power from a ˆz-oriented
dipole, scaled to match the strength of the polarization in the cavity, which is collected by a large NA lens
oriented in the ˆz-direction, as in the experiment. The results of this simulation are consistent with the measured
sum-frequency signal.

Figure 6. FDTD simulation of the sum-frequency polarization P (ω1 + ω2, ~r) = ǫ0χ(2)
zxy(Ex(ω1, ~r)Ey(ω2, ~r) +
Ey(ω1, ~r)Ex(ω2, ~r)) in the middle of the slab. The scalebar (arbitrary units) shows that the polarization is concentrated
at the center of the defect cavity, where the bulk χ(2) should dominate.

4. CONCLUSIONS

This work demonstrates that second-order nonlinear mixing of coherently-excited resonant modes in an InP-
based PPC microcavity is detectable, and that the bulk nonlinear polarizability of the InP is responsible for a
signiﬁcant component of the measured signal. Further work is needed to determine the origin of the SHG signal
from the individual cavity modes, and the source of the polarization modulation in the case of the sum-frequency
signal, both of which are likely associated with surface eﬀects at the boundaries of the etched holes used to deﬁne
the microcavities.

These results motivate further studies of nonlinear interactions in multi-mode PPC microcavities. In par-
ticular, higher Q modes with frequencies less than half the bandgap of the host material may make PPC-based

entangled photon sources possible. More generally, it will be interesting to quantify the ways in which resonant
nonlinearities, associated with excitonic transitions in embedded quantum dots, can inﬂuence the distribution of
the ﬁeld between diﬀerent high-Q, small volume microcavity modes.

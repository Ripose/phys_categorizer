Abstract

Contrary to the property of achromaticity (independence of wave-

length) usually associated with topological phases, we describe condi-

tions under which topological phases encountered in optics can show

sharp changes and reversals for small changes in wavelength, a phe-

nomenon originating in the occurrence of phase singularities, earlier

observed in interference experiments.

Achromaticity of the topological phase arising from polarization transfor-

mations of light [1] has been the basis of several applications [2]. Achromatic

retarders based on Pancharatnam’s work are routinely used in Astronomical

polarimetry. Using the standard example of the “QHQ retarder”, where Q

and H are quarterwave and halfwave retarders, the topological origin of achro-

maticity was explained in ref.[3] where it was also shown that at wavelengths

far removed from the design wavelength λ0 of the QHQ retarder it can show

the opposite behaviour i.e. sharp changes and reversals of phase retardation

originating in phase singularities [4, 5, 6]. Direct interferometric observations

of phase singularities were reported in [5, 6]. The new result I wish to report

here is that such sharp changes and reversals of phase retardation of a QHQ

retarder can in fact be made to occur at wavelengths arbitrarily close to λ0.

This would happen if the retardation of Q and H were equal to (2n + 1/2)π

and (4n + 1)π respectively, where n is an integer which could be made large.

A simple way to understand the eﬀect is to imagine a standard two-slit

interference experiment in which fringes are formed on a screen placed some

distance away from the slits. A QHQ retarder is placed in the path of one of

the two beams. Let the eigenstates of the retarder at λ0 be | X >, i.e. linear

polarization along the x-direction. For an | X >-polarized source illuminating

the slits, the intensity on the screen, by Pancharatnam’s prescription, is given

by

I = I1 + I2 + 2q(I1I2)Re(< X | U | X > eiφ),

(1)

where U is the 2x2 unitary polarization transformation matrix representing

the QHQ device and φ is a path-dependent phase varying along the screen.

U is a function of two parameters, (i) the retardation 2δ of Q (hence 4δ of

H) at the wavelength λ, assuming a dependence δ = (λ0/λ)(π/4), (ii) ρ, the

2

orientation of the fast axis of H with respect to the X-direction. The modulus

and phase of the complex visibility function γ =< X | U | X > determine

respectively the fringe contrast and the phase shift caused by the QHQ device.

The assumed λ-dependence of the retardation results when the two refractive

indices of Q and H are independent of wavelength. It was shown in ref.[3] that

(1) when 2δ = (2m + 1)(π/4), which happens when λ = (2λ0)/(2m + 1), phase

singularities occur at the HWP orientations ρ = mπ; m being an integer. At

these values, the modulus of γ goes to zero leading to zero contrast of the

fringes and its phase undergoes a sharp jump of magnitude π.

In a closed

circuit around any one of these singularities, the phase changes by ±2π. Such

phase changes have been veriﬁed experimentally in interference experiments

[5, 6]

(2) When 2δ = 2mπ − 3π/2, which happens when λ = λ0/(4m − 3), the

visibility is constant in magnitude and its phase increases linearly with ρ, the

device acting as a pure phase retarder. (3) When 2δ = 2mπ − π/2, which

happens when λ = λ0/(4m − 1), the visibility is constant in magnitude and

its phase decreases linearly with ρ, the device acting as a pure phase retarder

with the opposite sign.

The key point of this paper is that if the retardation of Q and H were

chosen to be 2nπ + π/2 and 4nπ + π respectively (multi-order waveplates), the

spacing in λ at which singularities and hence the phase reversals occur can be

made arbitrarily small. If we assume again a 1/λ dependence of retardation of

Q and H, the condition for phase reversal closest to the design wavelength for

such a retarder is given by, (2nπ + π/2)(λ0/λ) = (2nπ + 3π/2). This gives, for

n = 1, λ = .71λ0; for n = 2, λ = .82λ0; for n = 3, λ = .87λ0 and so on. It can
be concluded therefore that while topological phases can be made achromatic

3

which can be useful, they are not necessary so.

It may also be pointed out that there are other contexts in interferometry

wherein π phase jumps accompanying zero crossings of a real visibility function

can be seen as manifestations of a phase singularity of a complex visibility

function in a higher dimensional space. In such an enlarged description, the

π phase shift acquires a sign that is measurable. We wish to cite one such

example.

In an interesting extension of Pancharatnam’s phase criterion to the physics

of interference of mixed states, Sj¨oqvist et.al.

[7] have shown that if a beam

of particles with internal degrees of freedom , in a mixed state with a density

matrix ρ0, is split in a Mach-Zhender interferometer and a unitary transfor-

mation Ui acts on the space of N internal states in one of the two paths, a

phase diﬀerence given by arg Tr(Uiρ0) is introduced between the two beams.

Here “phase diﬀerence” is deﬁned as the shift in the maximum of the interfer-

ence pattern. This quantity, which is measurable, reduces to the phase shift

arg(< ψ0| Ui |ψ0 >), deﬁned by Pancharatnam [1] for pure states | ψ0 >. We

wish to point out that the mixed state phase as deﬁned in ref.[7] becomes inde-

terminate at points in the parameter space where | T r(Uiρ0) |=0. Eqn.(8) in

the paper shows that at such points the interference pattern is uniform, with

no fringes. Just as in the pure state case discussed above, such points consti-

tute singularities of phase involving discontinuous phase jumps and, depending

upon the context, may occur as singular lines or surfaces. The mixed state

phase involves singularities in new kinds of parameter spaces which include

variables representing decoherence of quantum states or depolarization in case

of polarization states of light. One can therefore have measurable 2nπ topo-

logical phases resulting from cycles in parameter spaces consisting of degree of

4

polarization and parameters of unitary transformation of polarization states.

Let us note that in the entire discussion above, we have been concerned with

the total phase and not just a geometric part of the phase.

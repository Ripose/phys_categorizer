Abstract

We introduce a small-core air-guiding photonic crystal ﬁber whose cladding is made of im-
proved air-silica photonic crystal with non-circular air holes placed in triangular lattice. The
ﬁber achieves un-disturbed bandgap guidance over 350nm wavelength range.

1.

Introduction

Lightwave delivery in a hollow-core photonic crystal ﬁber (PCF) is of signiﬁcant importance
for applications like laser beam handling, nonlinear optics in gases, sensing, atom/particle
guiding, and even for low-loss optical communication etc.1, 2 Current air-guiding PCF [Fig.
1(a)] explicitly uses air-silica photonic crystal (PC) made from a bundle of thin silica tubes
(triangular placement) in its cladding.2 Such ﬁber has two main disadvantages: surface-mode
interference and multimode operation. Though theoretically, there does exist some design
which eliminates the surface-mode problem,3 such ﬁber hasn’t been fabricated, largely due
to diﬃculties in preform preparation and maintaining the core shape during drawing. In
this paper, we introduce a hollow-core PCF [Fig. 1(b)] whose cladding is made of newly
proposed air-silica PC.4 The improved PC allows designs with smaller core size and/or
wider transmission window, etc.4 We will show that the air-guided mode in our proposed
ﬁber has an un-disturbed transmission over 350nm wavelength range, owing to the fact that
the surface modes stay very close to the bandgap edge. Potential single-mode operation with
such type of hollow-core PCF is also suggested.

2. Design and Numerical Analysis

In Fig. 1 we show three air-guiding PBG ﬁbers. In fact, both cladding PCs in Fig. 1(a) and
(b) are derived from the rods-in-air PC shown in Fig. 1(c). Guiding mechanisms of three
ﬁbers are of no diﬀerence — all of them can guide light with a cladding bandgap that exists
between the PCs 4th and 5th bands (computed using the plane-wave method with primitive

basis vectors); and we ﬁnd the mode proﬁles in low-order bands are equivalent for three PCs.
One portion of the cladding PC unit in Fig. 1(b) is sketched in Fig. 2. For the particular
ﬁber shown in Fig. 1(b), its cladding has Λ = 2.6µm, d = 0.98Λ (s = 0.02Λ), r = 0.14Λ,
and θ = 40◦. The core is formed by removing 12 silica pillars. Though we can easily get rid
of the surface-mode problem theoretically by using a design rule suggested in,5 we stick to
a practical core shape [Fig. 1(b)] to facilitate easy stacking and pressurization. Extra silica
veins surrounding air core are of thickness s.

The photonic bandgap (PBG) region possessed by the cladding PC is shown in Fig. 3(a)
by the white patch. It is noticed that the region is extending beyond air line to neﬀ = 0.922
(not shown), which is signiﬁcantly smaller than the value achievable with PC in Fig. 1(a)
(0.968). This feature allows us to design air-guiding ﬁbers with smaller core and/or lower-
loss air-guiding PCFs. We then use a full-vector ﬁnite-diﬀerence mode solver6 to compute
guided defect modes with four air-hole rings in the cladding. Numerical resolution is at
dx = dy = 0.12µm with 11 × 11 sub-grid index averaging. Perfectly matched layers have
12-grid thickness. The two degenerate fundamental air-guided modes (HE11-like) are shown

by the thick solid curve in Fig. 3(a). It is found the modes are un-disturbed in 1.35 ∼ 1.70µm
wavelength range. Their loss spectrum is shown by the thick curve in Fig. 3(b). Minimum
loss is about 1dB/m.

The |Ex| ﬁeld distributions of modes at point A (λ = 1.55µm, air-guided mode) and B
(λ = 1.3µm, surface mode) are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively. The core mode
at 1.55µm is very well conﬁned, and it has leakage loss of 1.2dB/m, which will decrease to
0.053dB/m and 0.003dB/m when the number of rings in cladding is ﬁve and six, respectively.
Though the six-ring loss value is higher than that for the ﬁber given in Fig. 1(a),7 it should
be reminded that our core size is signiﬁcantly smaller (diameter ∼ 7.4µm v.s. ∼ 13.6µm).
Loss should be decreased if additional pillars are removed in core region.

The proposed ﬁber is still multimode, largely because the gap region extends quite far
beyond air line. The dispersion curves of second-order modes (TE01-, two HE21- and TM01-
like modes) are shown in Fig. 3(a) by four thin solid lines. Their loss values (in dB/m),
represented by thin lines in Fig. 3(b), are about 30 times higher than that of the fundamental

modes. It should be noticed that, due to the small core size, the dispersion curves of the
fundamental and second-order mode groups in Fig. 3(a) stay further apart as compared to
the ﬁber reported in.2 This means the coupling between the two mode groups is smaller.
With careful excitation, we can achieve single-mode operation for applications like laser
beam delivery, in which severe ﬁber bending can be purposely avoided.

Surface modes are denoted by dotted lines in Fig. 3. An obvious advantage of our ﬁber
is that the surface modes stay very close to the bandgap edge. We attribute this to the
analogousness between silica pillars nearby core and those in cladding. It is observed from
Fig. 4(b) that a nodal line appears in each silica pillar adjacent to core. Such surface modes
are similar to 5th-band bulk cladding mode. They are pulled into gap region because the
pillars nearby core have slightly more silica than those in cladding PC. Hence their modal
energy is lower (higher in neﬀ). By varying cladding PC parameters, we should be able
to further reduce the impact of these modes, i.e., to push them closer to the gap region
boundary.

We have proposed a low-loss air-guiding PCF design which has 350nm un-disturbed PBG
guiding wavelength range.

Fundamental Limits of the Dispersion of the Two-Photon Absorption Cross-Section

(Dated: February 17, 2014)

We rigorously apply the sum rules to the SOS expression to calculate the fundamental limits of
the dispersion of the two-photon absorption cross-section. A comparison of the theory with the data
suggests that the truncated sum rules in the three-level model give a reasonable fundamental limit.
Furthermore, we posit that the TPA cross-section near the limit must have only three dominant
states, so by default, the three-level model is appropriate. This ansatz is supported by a rigorous
analytical calculation that the resonant term gets smaller as more states are added. We also ﬁnd
that the contributions of the non-explicitly resonant terms can not be neglected when analyzing
real molecules with many excited states, even near resonance. However, puzzling as it may be,
extrapolating an oﬀ-resonant result to resonance using only the resonant term of the three-level
model is shown to be consistent with the exact result. In addition, the oﬀ-resonant approximation
is shown to scale logarithmically when compared with the full three-level model. This scaling can
be used to simplify the analysis of measurements. We ﬁnd that existing molecules are still far from
the fundamental limit; so, there is room for improvement. But, reaching the fundamental limit
would require precise control of the energy-level spacing, independently of the transition dipole
moments – a task that does not appear possible using today’s synthetic approaches. So, we present
alternative methods that can still lead to substantial improvements which only require the control
of the transition moment to the ﬁrst excited state. While it is best to normalize measured TPA
cross-sections to the fundamental limits when comparing molecules, we show that simply diving by
the square of the number of electrons per molecule yields a good metric for comparison.

INTRODUCTION

Two-photon absorption is

the
resonant applications

fundamental pro-
cess behind most
such as
three-dimensional photolithography,[1] photodynamic
therapy,[2] high-density storage[3] and optical power
limiters.[4] All such applications require a large resonant
two photon absorption (TPA) cross-section. The devel-
opment of a deeper understanding of the TPA cross sec-
tion could be used as a guide to optimizing the nonlinear
response of molecules. Our approach is to use sum rules,
which relate transition dipole moments and energies to
each other, to learn how the various terms in the sum-
over-states expression interfere with each other and how
molecules can be designed for constructive interference.

The maximum fundamental limits of the largest di-
agonal tensor component of the oﬀ-resonance ﬁrst and
second hyperpolarizabilities have been calculated using
the generalized Thomas-Kuhn sum rules.[5, 6, 7] Ex-
trapolating this oﬀ-resonance result of the second hy-
perpolarizability made it possible to estimate the maxi-
mum values of the resonant two-photon absorption cross-
section.[8] Using this process, it is found that most or-
ganic molecules show a TPA cross section that falls

well below the estimated limit (by a factor of at least
10−3/2), suggesting that the paradigm for making organic
molecules for TPA applications may not be optimized.
This factor appears to be universally observed for single
molecules in all nonlinear processes studied (such as sec-
ond harmonic generation, hyper rayleigh scattering,[15]
and two photon absorption);[9] but can be breached if
the molecules are made to interact.[10] In any case, how-
ever, the fundamental limit has not been breached, nor
is it expected that it would be possible to do so since the
sum rules are as basic as the Schr¨odinger equation from
which it derives.

In the present work, we apply the sum rules directly to
the full dispersion of the TPA cross-section without ex-
trapolation and without neglecting any terms. As such,
these results are exact, in analogy with past calculations
of the fundamental limits of the oﬀ-resonant hyperpo-
larizabilities. We use our approach to analyze a series
of molecular measurements which shows that the fun-
damental limits are somewhat lower than predicted us-
ing extrapolation from the oﬀ-resonant result; but, the
molecules analyzed are still well below the fundamen-
tal limits. More importantly, we show that Two-Photon
Fluorescence measurement, used in getting TPA cross-
sections, may be inaccurate if all states are not included
in the analysis.

Two photon absorption is inherently a resonant pro-
cess because it quantiﬁes the strength of absorption of
two photons - each with energy ~ω - from the ground
state of energy E0 to the second excited state with en-
E0 = 2~ω. Consequently,

terms to γ are ignored. For such an approximation to be
valid, γres should dominate the response in the domain

the second hyperpolarizability γ, it is necessary to work
in the single-resonance regime to ensure that γres is the
only “resonant” term in the sum-over-states expression.
Studies of the ﬁrst and second hyperpolarizabilities
in the oﬀ-resonance regime clearly show that individual
terms in the sum-over-states (SOS) expression cannot
be independently adjusted since the terms are related
to each other through the sum rules.[5, 6] In fact, in the
SOS expression for γ there are additional two-photon res-
onant terms similar to Eq. 2 that contribute to γ. Even
if certain terms appear to dominate the response, all the
contributions must be included since the contribution of
just one term might not be representative of the full re-
sult - especially if there are cancellations between large
terms. Therefore, our calculations of the maximum limit

of the TPA cross-section includes all contributions to γ.
We also evaluate the relevance of the diﬀerent terms in
the SOS expression with the aim of determining whether
or not Eq. 2 is in general a good approximation to γI ;
an approximation that is used in determining the TPA
cross-section (and µ12) with TPA ﬂuorescence measure-
ments.

Note that the explicitly two-photon single-resonant terms
(when E20 = 2~ω) are all contained in S1 and S2 (Eqs.
4 and 5). T1 and T2 (Eqs. 8 and 9) contain terms that
will be resonant in the double-resonance regime (when
E10 = ~ω and E20 = 2~ω).

We consider a general three-level model and truncate
the Thomas-Kuhn sum rules to the ﬁrst three energy
levels to obtain relationships between the diﬀerent pa-
rameters that determine γ. The procedure is similar to
the one followed to obtain the maximum value of the oﬀ-
resonance ﬁrst and second hyperpolarizabilities.[5, 6] Un-
like this past work, the present work includes the eﬀects

of dispersion, so the widths of each state are included
by using an imaginary part of the frequency, as shown
in Equations 4 through 11. Hence, the expressions are
mathematically more algebraically messy. We therefore
use MATHEMATICA r

(cid:13) to evaluate the results.

The full set of self-consistent three-level truncated
Thomas-Kuhn sum rules yield relationships between

Our objective is to express γI in terms of X and E
and determine the fundamental limits of the TPA cross-
section, δ(ω), by ﬁnding the values of X and E that
maximize δ. It is important to emphasize that the calcu-
lation of the fundamental limits makes only one assump-
tion: the forces between the charges are described by a
potential energy that depends exclusively on the coordi-
nates of the electrons and the nuclei. The tools that we
use to calculate the fundamental limits, the generalized
Thomas-Kuhn sum rules, are fundamental identities de-
rived from the Sch¨odinger equation, and are applicable
to all electronic excitations, regardless of the particular
details of the molecule. However, we approximate the
molecule as a three-level system to model the response
and truncate the sum rules to three states, an approach
that has been successful at determining the fundamental
limits in the oﬀ-resonance regime.[5, 6] In fact, recent re-
search suggests that molecules with more excited states
have a smaller ﬁrst hyperpolarizability than the three-
level system.[15] As such, the limits we calculate are truly
an upper limit.

A. Contribution of the explicitly resonant
two-photon terms

We ﬁrst evaluate the contributions of the terms Im(S1)
and Im(S2) to γI , since they contain all the two-photon
resonant contributions (when E20 = 2~ω). Using the
three-level-truncated Thomas-Kuhn sum rules, we are
able to parameterize Im(S1) and Im(S2) in terms of E10,
E20, X, Γ10, and Γ20. Since these expressions are con-
strained by the three-level Thomas-Kuhn sum rules, they
are labelled ST K3
. We assume at all times that the two-
photon resonance condition is obeyed, that is E20 = 2~ω;
and we vary the other parameters.
We ﬁnd that both Im(ST K3

) vanish
1
when X = 0 and reach their maximum value when X =
1. Also, as Γ10 and Γ20 increase as a fraction of E10,
the values of Im(ST K3
) approach zero.
For our calculations we consider only one electron (N=1)
and we use typical values of the parameters for organic
molecules:

resulting in an imaginary third-order susceptibility that
peaks around E = 1/2. As such, to maximize the TPA
cross-section, the two lowest excited state energies of a
molecule must be equally spaced to allow for the double-

The analysis of the sum Im(ST K3

) shows
that to get a substantial TPA cross-section the system
must be close to the double-resonant condition (when
E20 = 2E10 = 2~ω).
In this regime, contributions of
terms such as Im(T T K3
) and Im(T T K3
) can play an es-
1
sential role, since they explicitly contain one-photon res-
onant terms (E10 = ~ω). Therefore, we now study the
behavior, individually, of all the terms that contribute
to the second hyperpolarizability as constrained by the
three-level truncated sum rules, γT K3
. We plot each term
(deﬁned by Eqs. 4-11) as a function of E in Figs. 2 and
3. For simplicity we have used the values deﬁned in Eqs.
21, 22 and 23 since these are the typical values for organic
molecules that absorb light in the visible.

Before proceeding, we must take a small detour to deal
with the fact that on double resonance, we must con-
sider the other excited states that may contribute to the
SOS expression for γI . This is certainly a crucial issue
when modelling real molecules, which have many excited
states beyond the ﬁrst three. However, we must also re-
call that our analysis focuses on understanding the fun-
damental limits. Thus, our calculations are based on the
ansatz that the hyperpolarizability, of any order, will be
maximized for any system when all of the transitions are
concentrated into three states.[19] As such, when we are
dealing with ideal molecules that are near the fundamen-
tal limit, the problems of higher lying states contributing
to γI is moot. The next section addresses this issue for
the explicitly-resonant term.

III. MAXIMUM VALUE OF γres FOR
MOLECULES WITH THREE OR MORE
ENERGY LEVELS

As discussed above, it could be argued that the limits
obtained using a three-level model do not necessarily hold
for real molecules with more than three energy levels.
That is, it is in principle possible that when a molecule
has more levels, the energy distributions allowed by the
sum-rules result in a higher limit than the values of γmax
listed in table I. This seems unlikely, since, as we will
see in the next section, all the measured values of δ(ω)
are much lower than the maximum limit values allowed
by the sum-rules, indicating that real molecules, with
more than three available levels, do much more poorly in
terms of TPA cross-sections than the idealized three-level
model.

I

I

.

We argue that the three-level model gives the best
possible value of γmax
In other words, as the oscilla-
tor strengths are spread out over more excited levels, the
value of γmax
decreases. Although this can not be proven
rigorously for the case of γT K∞
using all the SOS con-
I
tributing terms, it can be shown that if the values of E10
and E20 are known, the explicitly resonant term, γres is

I

a bounded quantity for any number of levels available
and that, indeed, the best performance of γres is achieved
when only three states are available.

To prove our assertion we start with the expression for
the explicitly resonant term, Eq. 2, which, in the TPA
regime E20 = 2~ω, can be written as:

γ

γres ≡

10µ2
µ2

iΓ10)2(

(E10

−

iΓ20)

−

.

(24)

Since we assume that E10 and E20 have ﬁxed values, we
optimize γres using µ2
12 as adjustable parameters.
Now we apply the Thomas-Khun sum-rules to a gen-
eral system with N ′-levels. The sum-rules can be written
as:

10 and µ2

(2Ei −

El)µkiµil =

δkl,

where δkl is the Kronecker delta. We generate a sum-rule
equation by choosing one pair of values of (k, l). They
can each be any integer between 0 and N ′.

First we consider the choice of parameters (k, l) =

(0, 0), which yields,

E10µ2

10 + E20µ2

20 + E30µ2

30 +

+ EN ′0µ2

N ′0 =

(26)
Since all the terms on the left side of the sum are positive,
it is obvious that µ2
20 will be maximized when:

10 and µ2

E30µ2

30 + E40µ2

40 +

+ EN ′µ2

N ′0 = 0,

(27)

· · ·

· · ·

that is, when only states 0, 1 and 2 are present.

Now we consider the combination (k, l) = (1, 1), which

generates the following sum-rule:

E10µ2

10 + E21µ2

10 + E31µ2

31 +

+ EN ′1µ2

N ′1 =

· · ·

−

(~e)2N

(28)

which can be rewritten as:

E21µ2

21+E31µ2

31+

+EN ′1µ2

N ′1 =

· · ·

(cid:19)
(29)
All the terms on the left side sum on Eq. 29 are positive
which implies that µ2

21 will be maximum when:

(cid:18)

10

.

2
31 +
E31µ

N ′1 = 0,

· · ·

(30)

which again would imply that only the states 0, 1 and 2
contribute. Therefore, if more states contribute and the
result is an enhancement of the response, it would nec-
essarily be due to the contribution of terms exclusive of
the γres term since we have proven that γres gets smaller
as the number of levels increases.

To summarize, we have found that the non-explicitly-
non-resonant terms can not be neglected in a strict three-
level system, and that if adding more states results in
an increase of the TPA response, it will be due to the
contribution of the non-explicitly-resonant terms in the
SOS expression.

IV. APPLICATIONS

6

In this section we apply the theoretical results to eval-
uate the literature values of the measured TPA perfor-
mance of organic molecules. We do so by comparing
the measured value of the TPA cross-section of a real
molecule with the maximum value of the TPA cross-
section allowed by the sum-rules. The eﬀective number of
electrons contributing to the nonlinear response is calcu-
lated by geometrically weighting the number of electrons
in each conjugated path of the molecule.[8] The molecules
under analysis are listed in Figures 6, 7, and 8, together
with the eﬀective number of electrons, Nef f . Note that
the dendrimer structures, shown in Figure 8, from top to
bottom shows molecules 20 and 21. The structures la-
belled G-1 and G-2 are the R-groups, that when added to
molecule 21, makes the dendrimers 22 and 23. The ef-
fective number of electrons are 18.4, 35.6, 55.8, and 82.7,
respectively.

The TPA cross-section values of molecules 1 to 12 have
been reported by Rumi and coworkers;[13] the values for
molecules 13 to 19 have been reported by Albota and
coworkers;[14] and the values for molecules 20 to 23 have
been reported by Drovizhev and coworkers.[18] The value
of E10 for each molecule is calculated from the wavelength
of maximum linear absorption. The values of the inverse
radiative lifetimes are estimated to be: Γ10
0.1eV .

Inﬂuence of the number of electrons

A simple consequence of the Thomas-Khun sum-rules
is that the two-photon cross-section of a molecule de-
pends quadratically on the eﬀective number of electrons.
With the aid of the sum-rules one can rewrite γT K3
as:

Φ,

(31)

where Φ is a dimensionless function that depends on the
energy ratios, the transition dipole moment ratios and
the inverse radiative lifetimes but does not depend on
Nef f . This is a general result that applies to molecules
with any number of levels. Eq. 31 together with Eq. 1
predict a quadratic dependence on the eﬀective number
of electrons for the TPA cross-section:

δ(ω)

Fig. 9 shows a plot of the TPA cross-sections of the
diﬀerent molecules as a function of N 2

low an approximately linear relationship, indicating that
even though the performance of a molecule is dictated by
many factors, it correlates with the square of the eﬀective
electrons.

B. Predicting the limiting values for real molecules

I

Using a three-level model, from the experimental val-
ues of Nef f , E10, Γ10 and Γ20, we can ﬁnd the maximum
value of γT K3
allowed by the sum rule, as follows. From
the theoretical section, the fundamental limit of γT K3
occurs when X = 1, so the problem is reduced to ﬁnd-
ing the optimal value of E20 that is consistent with the
sum-rules. We will denote this optimal value as Emax

.

I

20

20

The value of Emax

is substituted into Eq. 1 to obtain
the maximum value of δ(ω), which we will denote δmax
3L .
Since in the resonant TPA regime, E20 = 2~ω, δmax
3L can
be written as:

Since most of the molecules are geometrically one-
dimensional, an isotropic orientational average yields
= γI /5. The local ﬁelds are calculated using the

h
Lorentz-Lorenz[17] model with n = 1.4. Fig. 10 shows
the two photon performance (the ratio between the ex-
perimental value of δ(ω) and δmax

3L ).

All the measured TPA cross-sections fall below the pre-
10−3. This
dicted limits by an average factor of
shows that real molecules are far below the maximum
limit that is allowed by quantum mechanics. Perhaps,
as in the case of γI , the low performance ratio is due
to the existence of many states beyond the dominant
three-levels, which results in a dilution of the oscillator
strengths.

performance to the rest of the molecules, even though
its experimental value of δ(ω) is 2 orders of magnitude
higher than any other molecule in the collection. This
indicates molecule 23 owes its high TPA cross-section
mostly to the huge number of electrons contributing to
the nonlinear response, rather than to a better design
strategy that increases the eﬀectiveness of those elec-

trons.
by Drovizhev and coworkers, the best performance is
achieved by molecule 21. Molecule 24 would need to
have a δ(ω) value of approximately 1.4 times bigger than
its experimentally-determined value in order to be as ef-
ﬁcient as molecule 21.

The best performance is achieved by molecule 5. This
is a somewhat odd result, because molecule 5 belongs to
the group of homologues 1-5 and the performance of all
the other homologues is much worse. Rumi and cowork-
ers report that the experimental uncertainty on molecule
5 is bigger than for the rest of their reported molecules,
which could explain the discrepancy. The rest of homo-
logues 1-4 behave as expected: the values of δ(ω) in-
crease as the number of electrons is increased, but the
TPA performance is the same within experimental un-
certainty and low in comparison to the other molecules.
In the same manner, molecule 11 which extends the
conjugated path of molecule 8 shows the same perfor-
mance factor as its homologue and molecule 14 which
extends the conjugated path of molecule 13 shows a per-
formance factor that is the same as its homologue, within
experimental uncertainty.

Molecules 8 and 13 have the same performance factor
and also approximately the same value of E10. Since they
diﬀer structurally only by the type of radicals attached

9

to the central ring, we conclude that the eﬀects of both
types of radicals are similar in both the TPA performance
and the wavelength of maximum absorption. Similarly,
molecules 11 and 14 have the same performance and
similar values of E10. Again, they only diﬀer structurally
by the type of radicals attached to the central ring; so
we conclude that the eﬀects of both types of radicals are
similar.

Molecules 9, 10, 15 and 19 share a similar design strat-
egy and diﬀer by the type of groups attached to the cen-
tral rings. This diﬀerence has an inﬂuence on the TPA
performance. The best approach appears to be the at-
tachment of CN radicals, which makes molecule 15 the
second best molecule in the whole collection.

C. Comparison with other models

In the previous section, δmax

3L was calculated by ﬁnd-
ing the optimal value of E = E10/E20 and taking the
1. This requires “tuning” both the values
limit X
→
of E20 and
for the given molecule. A more real-
µ10
|
istic approach is to take the actual experimental values
of E10 and E20, calculate E, substitute these values into
δ(ω) and calculate the maximum value possible for those
energy values in the limit X
1. We will denote the
maximum value calculated in this way as δ(E)max.

→

|

Thus, for every molecule, we ﬁrst compute E as the
ratio between the experimental values of E10 and E20
and then we calculate the maximum TPA cross-section
allowed for that energy ratio, δ(E)max. This can be com-
pared with the maximum TPA cross-section possible for
the same value of E10 (with an optimized value of E),
δmax
3L . Figure 11 plots the ratios of the experimentally-
determined values normalized to each calculated limiting
3L and δ(ω)/δ(E)max, as a function of E10
value, δ(ω)/δmax
for each molecule.

From Fig. 11 it is clear that the energy ratio, E, is far
from optimized for all the molecules studied. If it were
possible to independently “tune” the value of E20 and the
value of X, the TPA cross-sections could be improved by
three orders of magnitude. However, if the experimental
value of E20 stays ﬁxed, the possible improvement for
typical molecules such as the ones studies here (by tuning
X) is only an order of magnitude.

To determine the relevance of the non-explicitly-
resonant terms, the maximum TPA cross-section allowed
for a particular value of E for a molecule, δ(E)max, can be
compared with the maximum value that would be possi-
ble if the response were determined only by the explicitly
resonant contribution, γres (Eq. 2). We will denote this
maximum value δres.

We can also calculate the maximum values predicted
by Kuzyk’s approximation technique of extrapolating
from the oﬀ-resonance results.[8] This oﬀ-resonance ex-
trapolation technique (ORET) assumes that γT K3

Fig. 12 plots the ratio between the measured TPA
cross-section, δ(ω), and the various calculated lim-

its:
δ(ω)/δres
ORET , which shows that both δORET and δres are
about an order of magnitude higher than δ(E)max. (Re-
call that δ(E)max is the fundamental limit of TPA ab-
sorption using all terms in the three-level model for a
ﬁxed E that is determined from experiment.) The ORET
extrapolation using the resonant expression (Eq. 34) ap-
pears to be of the same order of magnitude as the ex-
act calculation while the oﬀ-resonant approximation (Eq.
35) deviates by about an order of magnitude. Table II
shows a comparison of the ORET extrapolation and the
exact results. On average, variations between the ORET
extrapolation and the exact results are just over 30% –

FIG. 12: The ratio between the experimental value of δ(ω)
and δ(E)max, δres, δORET and δres

ORET .

the variation being the price of ignoring the non-explicitly
resonant contributions to γT K3

.

Next, we consider extrapolating the oﬀ-resonance
ORET term, given by Eq. 35. So, while the δORET values
are consistently larger than δ(E)max for each molecule,
they are approximately related logarithmically by:

I

ln(δ(E)max) = λ ln(δORET ),

δ(E)max = (δORET )λ,

±

To illustrate the validity of Eq. 37, we list the values
of δ(E)max and (δORET )0.773 for the diﬀerent molecules
in Table III. Within
20%, Eq. 37 is a good approxi-
mation for most of the molecules. The case of molecule
19, which has the largest variance, will be discussed later
in terms of the consistency of the three-model. Thus, in
our collection of 23 molecules there are only 4 outside the
20% range. As such, Eq. 37 is a good approximation of
±
the limit, which includes the eﬀects of the contributions
of the non-explicitly-resonant terms to γT K3
. This ap-
proximation is simpler to use and is more accurate than
the resonant expression, so provides the researcher with
a simple expression to evaluate molecules.

I

D. Consistency of the three-level model

In the previous section, δ(E)max was calculated by
substituting the experimental values of E10 and E20 into
1. Alternatively, with the
δ(ω) and taking the limit X
experimental values of E10, E20 and δ(ω) we can ﬁnd the
value of X that, using the three-level model, would yield
the same experimental value δ(ω).

So, for a given molecule, we can calculate X 3L, the
that is derived from the sum-rule-
ratio of
restricted sum-over-states three-level model and the ex-
perimental data. Three diﬀerent scenarios might result:

1. The value of X 3L is physically impossible (i.e. an
imaginary quantity, X 3L > 1, etc). In this case we
can conclude that the three-level model does not
describe the molecule.

2. The value of X 3L is physically allowed but in-
consistent with the typical values of X for or-
ganic molecules. For instance, the three-level model
could predict X 3L = 10−4 which is possible but
highly unlikely for real molecules. In this case we
would also conclude that the three-level model is
not likely to accurately approximate the molecule’s
TPA cross-section.

3. The value of X 3L is consistent with physically-

allowed values of X in a range that is typical for
organic molecules.
In this case, although we can
not conclude deﬁnitively that the three-level model
accurately describes the molecule, the reasonable-
ness of the result suggests that it may be suitable
as a model for real molecules.

Table IV lists the values of X 3L for the collection of
molecules reviewed here. The predicted values are all
consistent with what is normally observed for typical
molecules, except for molecules 16 and 19, which yield
complex values of X. Note that these two molecules
show the largest discrepancies in Table II. Clearly, for
these two molecules, the three level model does not do
a good job of modelling the TPA cross-section. Interest-
ingly, these two molecules (excluding 6) have the smallest
TPA performance ratio, a result that is constant with our
assertion that molecules with more contributing excited
states are less eﬃcient per electron. The rest, however,

to the three-level model as restricted by the sum-rules.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have applied the sum rules to the SOS expression
to calculate the fundamental limits of the dispersion of
the two-photon absorption cross-section. These results
apply at all wavelengths, so can be used both on and
oﬀ resonance. Our new rigorous analysis shows that the
three-level model and truncated sum rules together give
a reasonable fundamental limit and is a good approxi-
mation when modelling most molecules. This conclusion
partly follows from an analysis that applies the sum rules
to the resonant terms with an inﬁnite number of states,
and shows that the resonant term is at its maximum in
the three-level limit. This result is signiﬁcant because
it suggests that our ansatz that the three-level model

12

accurately describes molecules whose nonlinear suscepti-
bilities approach the fundamental limit is reasonable.

We have shown that the non-explicitly-resonant terms,
which are often ignored, can not be neglected in real
molecules even near resonance since these terms have a
profound eﬀect on resonant dispersion. As such, exper-
iments measuring TPA cross-sections that are analyzed
near resonance using only the resonant terms may yield
unreliable conclusions.

We ﬁnd that the simple process of extrapolating the
fundamental limit of the oﬀ-resonant two-photon absorp-
tion cross-section to resonance using only the resonant
term of the three-level model yields a result that corre-
lates well with our exactly rigorous results. A logarith-
mic relationship is proposed that can be used to convert
the oﬀ-resonance extrapolation result to the exact one
to within an accuracy of about
20%. This relationship
is much easier to apply than the full rigorous result and
should be useful to researchers who are interested in as-
sessing the TPA performance ratio of a molecule.

±

The TPA cross-sections of existing molecules are found
to be far from the fundamental limit; so, there is room for
improvement. To reach the fundamental limit would re-
quire precise control of the energy-level spacing, indepen-
dently of the transition dipole moments – a task that does
not appear possible using today’s synthetic approaches.
To make the task within reach, we present an analysis
of how a molecule can be maximized for a given energy
ratio, so, researchers only need to focus on adjusting the
oscillator strength to the ﬁrst excited state. While this
approach will not result in molecules with TPA cross-
sections at the fundamental limit, it can yield a factor
of ten improvements in the largest TPA cross-sections
measured.

Clearly it is best to normalize TPA measurements to
the fundamental limits when comparing molecules; but,
we have shown that simply diving by the square of the
number of electrons per molecule yields a good metric for
comparison. Such a simple performance metric is most
attractive for cases where the transition moments and
energy levels of a molecule are unknown, which is often
the case.

In summary, we report on a mix of theoretical results
and analysis techniques that will both aide in building
a deeper understanding of TPA cross-sections and pro-
vide the experimenter with quick methods for assessing
measurements.

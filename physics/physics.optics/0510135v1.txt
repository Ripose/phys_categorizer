Abstract. – We use the phenomenon of electromagnetically-induced transparency in a three-
level atomic system for hyperﬁne spectroscopy of upper states that are not directly coupled
to the ground state. The three levels form a ladder system: the probe laser couples the
ground state to the lower excited state, while the control laser couples the two upper states.
As the frequency of the control laser is scanned, the probe absorption shows transparency
peaks whenever the control laser is resonant with a hyperﬁne level of the upper state. As an
illustration of the technique, we measure hyperﬁne structure in the 7S1/2 states of 85Rb and
87Rb, and obtain an improvement of more than an order of magnitude over previous values.

The use of coherent-control techniques in three-level systems is now an important tool
for modifying the absorption properties of a weak probe laser [1, 2, 3]. For example, in
the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), an initially absorbing
medium is made transparent to a probe beam when a strong control laser is switched on
[4, 5]. EIT techniques have several practical applications in probe ampliﬁcation [6], lasing
without inversion [7], and suppression of spontaneous emission [3, 8, 9, 10]. Experimental
observations of EIT have been mainly done using alkali atoms (such as Rb and Cs), where the
transitions have strong oscillator strengths and can be accessed with low-cost tunable diode
lasers.

In this paper, we use the phenomenon of EIT in a novel application, namely high-resolution
spectroscopy of hyperﬁne structure in excited states. The experiments are done in a ladder
system, where the control laser drives the upper transition and the probe laser measures
absorption on the lower transition. In normal EIT experiments, the frequency of the probe
laser is scanned while the frequency of the control laser is kept ﬁxed. By contrast, in our
technique, it is the frequency of the control laser that is scanned while the probe laser remains
locked on resonance. The probe-absorption signal then shows transparency peaks every time
the control laser comes into resonance with a hyperﬁne level of the excited state.

Measurement of hyperﬁne structure in excited states is important because these states are
used in diverse experiments ranging from atomic signatures of parity non-conservation (PNC)

to resonance ionization mass spectrometry [11]. For example, the 7S state in Cs has been used
for the most sensitive test of atomic PNC to date [12]. However, to convert the experimental
results into useful information about the parity-violating weak interaction, the data has to be
compared to complex theoretical calculations in Cs. Knowledge of hyperﬁne structure thus
provides valuable information about the structure of the nucleus (nuclear deformation) and
its inﬂuence on the atomic wavefunction. Hyperﬁne spectroscopy on these excited states is
complicated by the fact that they have the same parity as the ground state and can only be
accessed through weak two-photon transitions. By contrast, our technique provides strong,
easily-measured signals.
In addition, there is an interesting narrowing of the linewidth in
room-temperature vapor by the use of counter-propagating beams, which is important for
high accuracy in the measurement. As an illustration of the power of this technique, we
have used it to measure hyperﬁne structure in the 7S1/2 state of Rb, and demonstrate an
improvement of more than an order of magnitude in precision over previous values.

The ladder system in Rb is shown in Fig. 1. The levels |1i, |2i, and |3i, are the 5S1/2,
5P3/2, and 7S1/2 states, respectively. The probe laser is tuned to the lower 5S1/2 ↔ 5P3/2
transition at 780 nm with a Rabi frequency of Ωp. The spontaneous decay rate from this state
(Γ21) is 6 MHz. The control laser is tuned to the upper 5P3/2 ↔ 7S1/2 transition at 741 nm
with a detuning of ∆c and Rabi frequency of Ωc. The spontaneous decay from this state back
to the ground state is primarily through the cascade 7S → 6P → 5S transition. The decay
rate Γ3 is 11 MHz.

The experimental set up is shown schematically in Fig. 2. The probe beam is derived from
a feedback-stabilized diode laser system operating at 780 nm [13]. The linewidth of the laser
after stabilization is less than 500 kHz. The probe beam has 1/e2 diameter of 2 mm. The
control beam comes from a ring-cavity Ti:Sapphire laser tuned to 741 nm. The Ti:S laser is
stabilized to an ovenized reference cavity that gives it an instantaneous linewidth of 500 kHz.
The control beam consists of two parts, one at the laser frequency and one that is frequency
shifted using an acousto-optic modulator (AOM). As discussed later, the AOM-shifted beam

Fig. 3 – Theoretical lineshapes for probe absorption.
In (a), we show the normalized absorption
curves with ∆p = 0 and Ωc = 20 MHz, for zero-velocity atoms and atoms moving with v = ±3 m/s.
In (b), we show the eﬀect of thermal averaging: the linewidth is reduced signiﬁcantly at T = 295 K
compared to T = 0 K. The scale of the transparency is also reduced, as seen from the right axis for
the T = 295 K curve. Note the inverted y-axes in both graphs.

is used for calibrating the frequency-scan axis. One important experimental requirement is
to double pass through the AOM so that the unshifted (zeroth-order) and shifted beams
propagate in the same direction. This ensures that the two components are mixed perfectly
and there is no angle between them. The control beam is similar to the probe beam and has
a diameter of 2 mm. The beam counter-propagates with respect to the probe beam through
a room-temperature vapor cell containing Rb. The absorption through the cell is about 25%.
The two beams have identical polarization and the angle between them is less than 10 mrad.
We ﬁrst consider the theoretical analysis of probe absorption in a ladder system in the
presence of the control laser. In the weak probe limit, the absorption of the probe is propor-
tional to Im(ρ21), where ρ21 is the induced polarization on the |1i ↔ |2i transition coupled by
the laser. From the density-matrix equations, the steady-state value of ρ21 is given by [14]:

where ∆p is the detuning of the probe from resonance. The calculated absorption curve (note
the inverted y-axis) for ∆p = 0 and Ωc = 20 MHz is shown in Fig. 3(a) as a function of ∆c.
The absorption is normalized to a value of 1 in the absence of the control laser. There is a
distinct EIT peak at line center: the absorption falls by about 80% when the control laser is
exactly on resonance. However, the linewidth of the transparency peak is quite large, with a
value of about 70 MHz for Ωc = 20 MHz.

The above analysis is correct for a stationary atom.

In a room-temperature vapor, we
have to account for the thermal velocity distribution. For an atom moving with a velocity v
in the same direction as the probe beam, the probe detuning decreases to ∆p − v/λp, while the
control detuning increases to ∆c + v/λc due to the counter-propagating conﬁguration. Here,
λp,c are the respective center wavelengths for the two transitions. The resulting absorption
curves for v = 3 m/s and v = −3 m/s are also shown in Fig. 3(a). The curve has a dispersive
lineshape, and shows increased absorption on one side of line center. More importantly, it is
slightly asymmetric because of the unequal values of λp and λc, i.e., for a given velocity, the
detuning changes by diﬀerent amounts for the probe and the control.

Fig. 4 – Experimental EIT peaks in Rb. In (a), we show the probe transmission as a function of
control detuning in 85Rb. The transparency peaks correspond to the two hyperﬁne levels labelled by
their F values. Control detuning is measured from the unperturbed 7S1/2 state. In (b), we show the
corresponding spectrum in 87Rb.

The eﬀect of this for a Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution is seen in Fig. 3(b). The
two absorption curves shown are for T = 0 K and T = 295 K. The interesting feature
is that the linewidth of the curve for room-temperature atoms is signiﬁcantly reduced by
thermal averaging; the use of a counter-propagating geometry decreases the linewidth from
70 MHz for zero-temperature atoms to 17 MHz for room-temperature atoms. The narrowing
is advantageous because it allows us to measure hyperﬁne intervals with greater precision.
However, the narrowing is accompanied by a decrease in the scale of the transparency, with
only 25% reduction in absorption at line center. Note also the slight lineshape distortion
for room-temperature atoms, where the absorption increases slightly before approaching an
asymptotic value. The cause for this is again the asymmetric detuning of the control and
probe for a given velocity. The distortion disappears when the value of Ωc increases beyond
100 MHz. Higher values of Ωc also result in power broadening of the linewidth, to about 50
MHz for Ωc = 100 MHz. Finally, because we are considering a ﬁxed frequency for the probe
beam, the spectrum has a ﬂat background (corresponding to absorption by the zero-velocity
atoms) and changes only when the control beam is close to resonance. This is diﬀerent from
other high-resolution spectroscopy techniques in room-temperature vapor, such as saturated-
absorption spectroscopy, where the spectrum shows an underlying Doppler proﬁle.

We now consider experimental spectra in 85Rb. The 7S1/2 state has two hyperﬁne levels:
F = 2 and 3 with an interval of 282 MHz. The probe laser is locked to the F = 3 →
3 hyperﬁne peak of the lower transition and has a power of 2 mW. The measured probe
transmission spectrum is shown in Fig. 4(a). As the control laser is scanned, there are two
distinct transparency peaks corresponding to the two hyperﬁne levels. The linewidth of the
peaks is about 50 MHz, which is the theoretically predicted linewidth at room temperature
for a Rabi frequency of 100 MHz. Note that the corresponding linewidth at T = 0 would be
about 1500 MHz. The value of Ωc = 100 MHz is consistent with the control power of 100 mW
used for this experiment. A similar spectrum for 87Rb is shown in Fig. 4(b), measured with
the probe laser locked to the F = 2 → 2 hyperﬁne peak. Note that the two hyperﬁne levels
(F = 1, 2) in this case have a larger separation of 638 MHz.

For the measurement of the hyperﬁne interval, there are two points to note from the
experimental curves. The ﬁrst is that we need a precise calibration of the frequency-scan axis
of the control laser. The second is that the height of the two peaks is very diﬀerent. Therefore,

Fig. 5 – Hyperﬁne measurement using AOM shifting. In (a), the upper trace is the probe transmission
in 85Rb in the presence of the AOM-shifted control beam. The new peak in the middle is the frequency-
shifted twin of the F = 3 peak, allowing precise calibration of the scan axis. The bottom trace is
obtained by reducing the rf power into the AOM and increasing the photodiode gain so that the
smaller peaks are comparable. In (b), we show a similar set of curves for 87Rb.

the measurement proceeds as follows. The scan calibration is achieved by using the AOM-
shifted control beam, as shown in the experimental schematic (Fig. 2). In the presence of
both control beams, the larger peak shows a twin peak at a location down-shifted by the
AOM frequency. The resulting spectrum of three peaks for 85Rb is shown in the upper trace
of Fig. 5(a). Note that the smaller peak also has a twin which will appear to its left, but this is
very small and not shown. Since the distance between the primary peak and its twin is exactly
the AOM frequency, this allows us to calibrate the frequency axis precisely. Now, the rf power
into the AOM is reduced so that the AOM-shifted peak becomes comparable in height to
the smaller peak, and simultaneously the gain of the photodiode ampliﬁer is increased. The
resulting spectrum is shown in the lower trace Fig. 5(a). The calibrated distance between the
smaller peak and the AOM-shifted peak is then used to determine the hyperﬁne interval. Note
that the primary peak saturates the ampliﬁer, but this is not important since it is not used in
the hyperﬁne measurement. In other words, the two large peaks in the upper trace are used
for calibration, while the two smaller peaks in the lower trace are used for the measurement.
A similar set of curves for 87Rb is shown in Fig. 5(b).

The primary advantage of this procedure is that the error in determining the peak position
is reduced. To the extent that the two peaks are similar, any systematic error in determining
the peak centers will cancel when taking the diﬀerence. The peak centers are determined in
two ways: ﬁrst by a peak-ﬁtting routine, and then by determining the zero crossing of the
numerical third derivative. This gives the peak position with a typical error of about 10 kHz.
Before we turn to the results, let us consider the sources of error in the technique. An
important consideration is a systematic shift of the probe laser from resonance due to eﬀects
such as stray magnetic ﬁelds in the vicinity of the vapor cell, phase shifts in the feedback
loop, and background collisions. However, it is important to note that this will not aﬀect the
measurement of the hyperﬁne interval at all. In other words, such a shift is equivalent to a
detuning of the probe from resonance, and it can be shown from Eq. 1 that a non-zero value
of ∆p will simply shift the location of the transparency peak by this amount in the opposite
direction. Hence, both peaks in Fig. 3 will shift by the same amount and the hyperﬁne interval
will be unaﬀected.

Similarly, the eﬀect of an angle between the probe and control beams is unimportant.

Such an angle implies that the two beams come into simultaneous resonance with a non-zero
velocity group. Since the velocity can be either positive or negative, this only causes a small
broadening of the EIT peak but does not aﬀect the peak center. Indeed, we have seen that
there is no measurable change in the linewidth of the theoretical curves shown in Fig. 3(b) for a
misalignment angle of 10 mrad, which is the maximum value of the angle between our beams.
However, there could be a systematic shift of line center if there is velocity redistribution
due to radiation pressure eﬀects, but this should be the same for both peaks and cancel in
a diﬀerence measurement. In a similar manner, shifts due to collisions will aﬀect both peaks
equally and cancel in the diﬀerence.

Thus the main sources of error in our technique arise due to residual nonlinearity of
the frequency-scan axis, and the accuracy in determining the peak centers. To check for
these errors, we have repeated the measurements at various values of the AOM frequency. A
representative list of 6 measurements to show the range of AOM frequencies is given in Table
I. The ﬁnal values are obtained by taking an average of all the measurements and calculating
the error in the mean. From a total of about 60 measurements in 85Rb and 40 measurements
in 87Rb repeated over a period of several days, we obtain the following average values for the
hyperﬁne interval:

85Rb: {F = 3 − F = 2} = 282.254(54) MHz,
87Rb: {F = 2 − F = 1} = 638.347(90) MHz.

The quoted errors include a systematic error of 40 kHz to account for unknown sources of
error. The larger error in 87Rb is because of the larger interval being measured, requiring
larger extrapolation of the scan axis. The measured interval can be used to calculate the
value of the magnetic-dipole coupling constant A in the 7S1/2 state as:

85Rb: A = 94.085(18) MHz,
87Rb: A = 319.174(45) MHz.

These values are compared with the recommended values from Ref. [15] in Fig. 6. As can be
seen, the values are consistent, but the accuracy is improved considerably, by a factor of 35
in 85Rb and by a factor of 71 in 87Rb.

In summary, we have demonstrated a new technique for high-resolution hyperﬁne measure-
ments in excited states using the phenomenon of electromagnetically-induced transparency.
The experiments have been done using a ladder system in atomic Rb. The weak probe laser
is locked to the lower transition while the strong control laser is scanned across the upper
transition. Transparency peaks appear in the probe transmission whenever the control laser
comes into resonance with a hyperﬁne level. The frequency axis of the control laser is set by

using an AOM-shifted beam with a known frequency oﬀset. In this manner, we are able to
measure hyperﬁne intervals in the 7S1/2 state of Rb with an error of less than 100 kHz. This
is already a considerable improvement over previous measurements, but we have not really
pushed the limits of accuracy of this technique. For example, we have recently demonstrated a
technique for measurement of hyperﬁne intervals with 20 kHz accuracy using an AOM whose
frequency is locked to the hyperﬁne interval of interest [16]. This will eliminate any potential
errors due to nonlinearity of the scan. Using this method, we hope to be able to further
improve the accuracy of the current technique. We plan to measure excited-state hyperﬁne
structure in other atoms that are of interest for PNC measurements, such as Cs and Yb [17].

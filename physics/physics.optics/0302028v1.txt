(Dated: February 9, 2008)

We calculate magneto-optical rotation of spectrally impure ﬁelds in an optical thick cold atomic
medium. We show that the spectral impurity leads to nonlinear dependence of the rotation angle on
optical density. Using our calculations, we provide a quantitative analysis of the recent experimental
results of G. Labeyrie et al. [Phys. Rev. A 64, 033402 (2001)] using cold Rb85 atoms..

I.

INTRODUCTION

A very useful way to get important spectroscopic infor-
mation is by measuring magneto-optical rotation (MOR)
of a plane polarized light propagating through a medium
[1]. Clearly it is desirable to obtain as large an angle of
rotation as possible [2, 3].
It is known that the angle
of rotation is proportional to the density of the medium.
Thus an increase in density will help in achieving large
rotation angles. Recently, very large rotation angles in a
cold sample have been reported [4]. In this experiment,
optical densities of the order of 10
20 were achieved.
This experiment also reported a very interesting result,
viz., the departure from the linear dependence of the ro-
tation angle on the optical density. This departure has
been ascribed to the nonmonochromatic nature of the in-
put laser. The ﬁndings of the experiment warrant a quan-
titative analysis of the dependence of the rotation angle
on the spectral proﬁle of the input laser. We present a
ﬁrst principle calculation of this dependence. Note that
a nonlinear dependence on optical density cannot result
from a simple argument based on the standard formula
for the rotation angle θ:

−

θ = πkl Re(χ− −

χ+) ,

(1)

where, k is the wave-number of the electric ﬁeld, l is
the length of the medium, and χ± represent the linear
susceptibilities of the medium for right or left circularly
polarized components of the input ﬁeld. Since χ± are
proportional to the number density, the rotation angle
becomes proportional to the optical density α deﬁned by

α =

N l ,

3λ2
2π

(2)

where, λ = 2π/k is the wavelength of the input ﬁeld, N
is the number density of the atomic medium. If one were
to argue that spectrally impure laser ﬁeld would replace
χ± by their averages over the width of the laser, then θ
would continue to be proportional to the optical density
α. A more quantitative analysis of the rotation angle is
thus warranted.

The organization of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II,
we recapitulate the relevant equations for studies of MOR

in atomic medium. In Sec. III, we describe a simple three-
level atomic conﬁguration in the context of MOR and
discuss the eﬀect of laser line-shape and magnetic ﬁeld
in a thick atomic medium. In Sec. IV, we consider ex-
perimental conﬁguration used in [4]. We show, how in
an optically thick medium, one deviates from the linear
dependence of rotation on optical density as a result of
the spectral impurity of the laser ﬁeld. We give a quan-
titative analysis of the experimental data.

II. BASIC EQUATIONS

Let us consider that an atomic medium of length l is
resonantly excited by a monochromatic ˆx-polarized elec-
tric ﬁeld

~E(z, t) = ˆx

sponding angular frequency and wavelength. The ﬁeld is
propagating in z-direction. Clearly, we can resolve the
amplitude of the electric ﬁeld into its two circular com-
ponents as

where,
two circular polarization ˆǫ± = (ˆx

E± =

/√2 are the amplitude components along

While passing through the atomic medium these
two circular components behave diﬀerently due to the
anisotropy of the medium. Let χ± be the susceptibilities
of the medium corresponding to the two circular compo-
nents. The electric ﬁeld at the exit face of the medium
can be written as

~E(l, t) = ~
~

where, we have assumed that the medium is dilute so
that
1. In MOR, the polarization direction of
the input electric ﬁeld gets rotated due to the diﬀerence
in their dispersions (phase shifts) in a non-attenuating
medium. The electric ﬁeld however, remains linearly po-
larized after passing through the medium. In the present

case, because the atom interacts with near-resonant elec-
tric ﬁeld, the two circular components suﬀer attenuation
(given by the imaginary part of χ±) while propagating
through the medium. Thus the medium, concerned here,
is responsible for both dispersion and attenuation. We
term the medium to be both circularly birefringent and
circularly dichroic. The output electric ﬁeld becomes el-
liptically polarized under the action of such a medium.
Thus to fully characterize the polarization state of the
output ﬁeld, one has to use the Stokes parameters [5].
The four Stokes parameters for an electric ﬁeld are desig-
nated by Sα (α = 0, 1, 2, 3) and can be deﬁned as follows:

S0 = Ik + I⊥ ,
I⊥ ,
S1 = Ik −
S2 = I45o
−
S3 = Iσ+ −

I−45o ,
Iσ− ,

where, Iˆn is the measured intensity along the polariza-
tion direction ˆn. Then the output polarization state can
be characterized by the following three quantities:

where, P is the degree of polarization, i.e., the ratio of
the intensities of the polarized component to the unpo-
larized one, θ is the Faraday rotation angle of the input
ﬁeld and is measured between the major axis of the ellipse
and the x-axis, φ provides the ellipticity of polarization
through the relation e = tan φ.

From Eq. (5) one can express the output intensities
along diﬀerent polarization directions in the following
way:

coupled to the ground state
(Jg = 0, mg = 0) by
two circular components σ± of ˆx-polarized electric ﬁeld
[Eq.

moved by an uniform magnetic ﬁeld ~B applied in the

In what follows, we will assume that ωl = ω+g(B = 0).
We calculate
’s using Eqs. (10) and (9) numerically
for diﬀerent values of γc and s. We show the results
s, the rotation
in Fig. 2. We clearly see that for γc ≪
angle θ is linearly proportional to α. But for γc & s, this
variation deviates from linearity in large α domain. This
behavior can be explained in terms of the oﬀ-resonant
components which dominate for the large γc and large α.
In order to understand the numerical results, we ﬁrst

consider the limit of small optical densities whence

Thus, the departure of the rotation angle from the lin-
earity has to do with the averages of the exponentials
appearing in I’s [Eq. (8)]. If one were to make the ap-
proximation of replacing all χ’s in Eq. (8) by their aver-
ages, i.e.,

Clearly, the absorption does not contribute to the ro-
tation angle. We have again recovered the linear depen-
dence of θ on α, provided the approximation (14) is valid.
Thus, any departure in linearity of θ with respect to α
indicates the breakdown the approximation (14). The
numerical results of Fig. 2 clearly show the breakdown of
the mean ﬁeld description obtained by replacing χ’s by
their average values.

From the Eq. (16), we readily see that in the low α-
domain, by increasing s (or γc) while keeping γc (or s)
constant, the slope of θ with α decreases. This is clear
from the numerical results of Fig. 2. Also, for larger
values of γc, variation of θ with α is deviated from lin-
earity. Linear variation of θ with α is attributed to the
monochromatic laser ﬁeld.
If the electric ﬁeld is spec-
trally impure, then the oﬀ-resonant components also con-
tribute to θ, through the relations (9), (6), and (7). Thus,
θ starts varying with α linearly in low α limit, then satu-
rates, and ﬁnally decreases to zero to change the direction
of rotation, for larger γc (see Fig. 2). But for smaller γc,
the linear behavior is retained even for larger α, as the
oﬀ-resonant components are not dominant in this param-
eter zone.

Next we consider the variation of the degree of polar-
ization P and the ellipticity e with α. We have noticed
that P decreases from unity for increasing α. This means
that the output ﬁeld no longer remains fully polarized,
rather it becomes partially polarized.

Again, from the Eqs. (6d), (8d), and (11), it is clear
that an integration over the entire range of detuning δ
would yield
= 0, as the integrand is an odd function
of ω. Thus the ellipticity e becomes zero. This means
that the polarized part of the output ﬁeld remains linear.

S3i
h

From the above discussion, it is clear that the output
ﬁeld gets rotated as a manifestation of cumulative eﬀect
of optical density, magnetic ﬁeld, and laser line-width.
Also it becomes partially polarized with no ellipticity.

IV. QUANTITATIVE MODELING OF

We now extend our understanding of resonant MOR
as described in the previous section to explain the exper-
imental data of Labeyrie et al.. In their experiment, a
cold atomic cloud of Rb85 is subjected to a static mag-
netic ﬁeld. The laser probe beam passing through the
medium in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld is tuned to

linear behavior is recovered.

To explain these observations, we consider the rele-
vant energy levels of Rb85 as used in the experiment
(see Fig. 3). The ˆx-polarized electric ﬁeld (3) is applied
to cold Rb85 medium near resonantly. The medium is
subjected to uniform magnetic ﬁeld ~B applied in the z-
direction, i.e., along the direction of propagation of (3).

A. Calculation of χ± and optical density

mg = me −

The circular components σ± of the input electric ﬁeld
1 and
(3) interact with the transitions me ↔
mg = me + 1, respectively. We assume that the
me ↔
electric ﬁeld is weak enough so that it is suﬃcient to use
the linear response of the system to the laser ﬁeld. We
neglect the ground-state coherences. As we are consider-
ing the cold atoms, we neglect the collisional relaxations
and Doppler broadening of the sublevels. We also assume
that the atomic population is equally distributed over all

the ground sublevels.

Using all these assumptions, we can write the suscep-
tibilities χ± for the σ± components as the sum of the
mg transitions

mind that it is diﬀerent from the deﬁnition in Sec. III.

It should be borne in

the Faraday angle θ varies with the optical density α for
s, the
diﬀerent values of γc and B. Clearly, for γc ≪
rotation angle θ varies linearly with α. But for larger γc
(& s), the variation of θ with α deviates from linearity in
large α. This is because the oﬀ-resonant components con-
tribute to the output intensity. Also, note that for a given
value of γc, if s is increased, the linearity is maintained
even in the large α-domain. This is because for larger s,
the oﬀ-resonant components do not contribute much to
the output intensity. The resonant frequency component
is always dominant in the optical density range consid-
ered. We also note that, as γc increases, the linear slope
of θ with α decreases in the small α domain.

In Fig. 5, we show the variation of degree of polariza-
tion P with α for various values of the B and γc. These
results reveal that with increase in α, the degree of polar-
ization deviates from unity, i.e., the output electric ﬁeld
not only rotates in polarization, but also it becomes par-
tially polarized. However, the ellipticity of the output
ﬁeld still remains zero as we have argued in Sec. III.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Using the above expressions of χ± [Eq. (17)] and
in dif-
Eq. (9), we calculate the averaged intensities
ferent polarization directions. The Stokes parameters Sα,
degree of polarization P , and the Faraday rotation θ are
calculated using the relations (7). In Fig. 4, we show how

In summary, we have given a quantitative analysis of
magneto-optical rotation of spectrally impure ﬁelds in
optically thick cold Rb85 atomic medium. We have shown
that the dependence of rotation on the optical density of

the medium deviates from linearity due to the ﬁnite laser
linewidth. Using our model, we explain the experimental

results of Labeyrie et al..

We demonstrate a dramatic change in the interaction forces between dark solitons in nonlocal
nonlinear media. We present, what we believe is the ﬁrst ever experimental evidence of attraction
of dark solitons. Our results indicate that attraction should be observable in any nonlocal systems,
such as Bose-Einstein condensates with repulsive long-range interparticle interaction.

It is commonly accepted that solitons, i.e.

localized
waves propagating without changing their shape, are
ubiquitous in nature [1]. A soliton can form when the dis-
persive or/and diﬀraction processes associated with the
ﬁnite size of the wave are counterbalanced by the wave
self-induced change of the properties of the medium. In
the context of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) for ex-
ample, the soliton represents a coherent excitation of a
matter wave [2], whereas in optics it is a localized light
beam or light pulse [3]. Solitons are native to many di-
verse systems like plasmas, molecular chains, spin waves,
atmospheric physics, superﬂuidity, nonlinear optics, and
BEC. The continuous interest in solitons is stimulated
by their unique collisional properties, i.e. they behave
like particles displaying forces in their mutual interac-
tion. Moreover, the fundamental features of their inter-
action are of rather universal character. Thus, for exam-
ple, matter wave solitons interact basically in the same
way as optical or plasma solitons.

There are two fundamental types of solitons, bright
in the form of localized structures [4], and dark in the
form of a localized dip in a plane-wave background [5,
6, 7, 8, 9]. Already early studies pointed out a distinc-
tive diﬀerence between the interaction of bright and dark
solitons. Bright solitons can both attract or repel, de-
pending on their relative phase. The phase between dark
solitons is always ﬁxed and they are believed to always
repel [5, 10, 11, 12]. Recently, we predicted theoreti-
cally [13] that the nature of dark soliton interaction may
change drastically in the presence of nonlocal response
of the material.
In this letter we report the ﬁrst ex-
perimental observation of attraction between spatial dark
solitons in any physical system. We employ spatially non-
local defocusing nonlinearity to provide an experimental
evidence disproving the common view on dark solitons
interaction.

cality is an inherent property of many physical systems.
It often results from a transport process, such as atomic
diﬀusion [14] or heat conduction [15, 16]. Spatial nonlo-
cality is also natural for media with a long-range inter-
particle interaction, including, for instance, BEC’s of par-
ticles displaying a strong magnetic dipole moment [17],
or nematic liquid crystals with a long-range molecular
reorientational interactions [18, 19]. It appears that non-
locality leads to novel phenomena of a generic nature.
For instance, it may promote modulational instability in
self-defocusing media [20, 21, 22, 23], as well as suppress
wave collapse and stabilize multidimensional solitons in
self-focusing media [24, 25, 26, 27]. Nonlocal nonlinear-
ity may even describe parametric wave mixing [28]. Fur-
thermore, nonlocality signiﬁcantly aﬀects bright soliton
interaction [29]. Below we demonstrate experimentally
how nonlocality aﬀects the forces acting between dark
solitons,changing their character from repulsive to attrac-
tive.

Our experiments are performed in a weakly absorb-
ing liquid with a thermal defocusing nonlinearity. Light
absorption results in raising the temperature of the liq-
uid and subsequently decreasing its density and refrac-
tive index. In addition, heat conduction leads to a tem-
perature and subsequently refractive index proﬁles much
wider than the light beam itself, indicating the inherently
nonlocal character of thermal nonlinearity.

An optical beam propagating along the z-axis of a
weakly absorbing liquid with the scalar amplitude of the
electric ﬁeld E(x, z, t) = ψ(x, z, t) exp(ikz − iωt) + c.c. is
described by the system of coupled equations [15]

In nonlocal nonlinear media the nonlinear response in-
duced at a certain point is carried away to the surround-
ing region.
In this way a localized wave can induce a
spatially broad response of the medium. Spatial nonlo-

the nonlocal nonlinear response and in a spatially local Kerr
nonlinear medium, respectively.

spatial dynamics of the refractive index change of the
medium ∆n = ∆n(x, z, t) induced by a heat source in
the form of a beam with intensity I(x, z, t) = |ψ(x, z, t)|2.
Eq. (2) is a nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation governing the
evolution of the beam amplitude in the presence of non-
linear refractive index change. We solved these equa-
tions numerically using a split-step Fourier method for
the propagation equation and a ﬁnite diﬀerence method
for the heat equation. For simplicity we assumed unre-
stricted heat ﬂow in the transverse direction. The ab-
sorption coeﬃcient is set to α = 2 × 10−2 which results
in 10% power loss over the 50 mm propagation distance.
As an initial condition we used a broad Gaussian beam
(peak intensity I0) of a width 2.8 mm, with two closely
placed π phase jumps. Such initial conditions result in
a formation of two “black” solitons of a zero individual
transverse velocity [30].

An example of steady-state trajectories of two adja-
cent dark solitons separated by a distance of 60 µm are
shown in Fig. 1(a). The heat transfer in the transverse
direction provides a long-range interaction between the
two solitons. The inward bending of the trajectories of
both solitons clearly indicates their attraction. For longer
propagation distances the separation between the two
solitons oscillates, leading to formation of an oscillatory-
type bound state. This behaviour strongly diﬀers from
the interaction of dark solitons in local nonlinear media,
where the trajectories of generated solitons diverge due
to soliton repulsion.

It should be stressed that while the soliton interaction
shown in Fig. 1(a) has been obtained for a speciﬁc model
of nonlinearity, the same soliton dynamics is predicted
by the general nonlocal models [13]. This points towards
the generic nature of the nonlocality-mediated attraction
of dark solitons. The physics of this eﬀect can be intu-
itively explained as follows. In a nonlocal medium the
two dark solitons with an intensity proﬁle depicted in

FIG. 2: (a) Calculated output separation (z=50 mm) versus

(b) Diverg-
ing solitons (initial separation 20 µm); (c) attracting solitons

Fig. 1(b, bottom plot) induce a change in the refractive
index which has the form of a broad waveguide [Fig. 1(b,
top)]. This waveguide structure acts as a potential well,
providing an attractive force that counteracts the natural
repulsion of the solitons and ultimately supports the for-
mation of bound states. For comparison, in Fig. 1(c) we
show the index distribution induced by the same intensity
proﬁle (bottom plot) but in a local Kerr-type nonlinear
medium. Clearly, in this case the index has a form of two
distinct potential wells separated by a barrier [Fig. 1(c,
top plot)]. Thus, no attractive forces exist in local media.
The separation between the solitons obviously deter-
mines the shape of the resulting potential, and subse-
quently the strength of their interaction. In Fig. 2(a) we
present the numerically determined separation between
the two dark solitons, after propagation of 50 mm, as a
function of their input separation for low (linear regime
– squares) and high (nonlinear regime – circles) intensity
of the background beam. As the graph shows, for ini-
tial separations greater than 180 µm the ﬁnal separation
of the dark solitons is close to that of diﬀracting dark
beams in a linear regime. This is so, because for such
large separation the nonlocality does not contribute ap-
preciably to already very weak soliton interaction. The
most interesting region in Fig. 2(a) corresponds to closely
spaced solitons (20–180 µm). It is evident that for such
separations the distance between the solitons is a non-
monotonic function of the initial separation and it is less
than the separation in the linear regime. This behav-
ior is a direct manifestation of the nonlocality induced
attraction of these solitons.

For closely spaced initial dark notches, the gener-
ated solitons strongly repel and their ﬁnal separation is
larger than in the diﬀraction (linear) regime. Indeed, as

seen in the inset of Fig. 2(a, left), for the two closely
spaced dark solitons, the repulsive forces dominate over
the nonlocality-induced attraction and their trajectories
quickly diverge. As the initial separation increases, repul-
sion weakens and the presence of nonlocality-mediated
attraction makes the soliton trajectories to bend to-
wards each other (right), indicating attraction. Plots in
Fig. 2(b,c) illustrate the output intensity and the refrac-
tive index proﬁles (which plays the role of conﬁning po-
tential) in those two cases. As in Fig. 1, for the diverging
solitons the potential has a form of two distinct wells sep-
arated by a barrier, whereas attraction occurs when the
potential represents a single well conﬁning both solitons.
To investigate experimentally the interaction of dark
solitons in a nonlocal nonlinear medium we used the ex-
perimental setup shown in Fig. 3. A laser beam from a
frequency doubled solid-state laser (Verdi-V, λ = 532nm)
was expanded by a system of lenses and passed through
two closely overlapping microscope glass slides. The
slides were subsequently imaged by a telescope onto the
input face of a 50 mm long glass cell. The resulting beam
diameter at the cells input was 2.8 mm (full width at
half maximum). The glass cell is ﬁlled with paraﬃn oil
dyed with iodine. The iodine serves as a weak absorber
of the green light and its low concentration of 0.5 mg/l
ensures that the total absorption in the cell is ≈ 10%.
The density of paraﬃn oil decreases with increasing tem-
perature, thus resulting in a self-defocusing nonlinear re-
sponse. The two glass slides modify the phase structure of
the beam. They are tilted at a small angle with respect to
the beam in order to adjust their optical thickness, such
that it results in π phase jumps in the light ﬁeld at the po-
sition of the glass edge. The phase modulation also gives
rise to unavoidable small amplitude modulation at the
front face of the cell (the inset in Fig. 4). The input and
the output facets of the cell are imaged onto two CCD
cameras by large numerical aperture imaging lenses. An
advantage of the liquid nonlinear medium is the possi-
bility to trace the beam evolution along its propagation
direction. This is achieved by immersing a translatable

mirror into the liquid and visualizing the beam proﬁle at
diﬀerent distances [31]. Because of the ﬁnite size of this
mirror, however, the ﬁrst 19 mm of beam propagation
could not be directly accessed.

The input beam phase proﬁle was monitored by inter-
ference with a reference plane-wave [Fig. 4(top inset)].
Both phase jumps were set to π within the accuracy
of our interferometric measurement (∼10%). This ac-
curacy was increased by monitoring the beam proﬁle at
the far ﬁeld and setting the intensity in the dark notch to
zero. By varying the transverse position of the slides we
can change the initial separation between the generated
dark notches. A typical intensity proﬁle at a separa-
tion of 59 µm is shown in [Fig. 4(bottom inset)]. The
width of each notch is a ∼18 µm, which corresponds
to ∼10 diﬀraction lengths of propagation in the non-
linear medium. The individual propagation in the self-
defocusing medium results in formation of a “black” soli-
ton of zero transverse velocity [30]. The experimental
conditions for dark soliton formation were determined
by attaining saturation of the, so-called soliton constant,
I0a2, with input beam power [32].
In our experiments
this regime was reached at approximately 3 W of input
power. All our measurements were performed at slightly
higher power levels (3.5 W) to assure soliton regime in
the presence of interaction and absorbtion.

When placed suﬃciently close, both dark solitons (with
parallel individual trajectories) interact during propaga-
tion. This inﬂuences their output separation, which is
compared to the separation at low power. In Fig. 4 we de-
pict the distance between the dark solitons at the exit of
the cell as a function of their initial separation. The dots
represent nonlinear regime (3.5W), while squares corre-
spond to linear diﬀraction (no nonlinearity, 10 mW beam

ﬁrst experimental demonstration of the nonlocality medi-
ated attraction of dark spatial solitons. Our experimental
observation are conﬁrmed by direct numerical analysis of
the ensuing model of the nonlocal nonlinearity of ther-
mal origin. Importantly, as this type of soliton interac-
tion is generic for nonlocal nonlinearity, our results are
applicable to other physical systems including Bose Ein-
stein condensate, where spatial nonlocality is a result of
a long-range interparticle interaction.

FIG. 5: (a) Measured output separation of interacting non-
local dark solitons in thermal medium as a function of the

power). The measured exit separation of solitons quite
faithfully reproduces the theoretical predictions. We see
that for initial separations of 20-180µm the ﬁnal distance
between the solitons is less than in the linear regime.
Moreover, for input separations of 115-200 µm the ﬁnal
separation is actually smaller than the initial one. This
unambiguously indicates the presence of attractive forces
counteracting the natural repulsion of solitons.

We can obtain a clearer picture of soliton interaction by
following their trajectories inside the nonlinear medium.
This is illustrated in Fig. 5 where we show the mea-
sured separation between solitons along the cell. Dif-
ferent curves in this ﬁgure represent initial separation of
59, 91, 101, and 117 µm between the solitons. For initial
separation of 59 µm the repulsive force between solitons
is strong and can not be compensated by the nonlocality
induced attraction. Therefore, for this separation the two
dark solitons repel. Situation changes drastically for the
initial separation of 91, 101 and 117 µm. At certain dis-
tance the solitons actually come closer than their initial
separation. This behavior can not be directly observed in
the case of separation of 91 and 101 µm since the decrease
of soliton separation occurs at the initial non-accessible
part of propagation distance. However, it is particularly
visible for 117 µm separation. The non-monotonous char-
acter of the soliton trajectories is a direct proof of the
interplay of repulsive and nonlocality-mediated attractive
forces acting between the solitons. When the attraction
dominates, solitons decrease their mutual separation un-
til the repulsion prevails forcing them to move apart. The
contour plot in Fig. 5(b) shows the experimentally ob-
tained trajectories of both dark solitons in this regime
(initial separation of 117 µm). Dashed line indicate lo-
cation of the intensity minima. The inward bending of
these trajectories is clearly visible.

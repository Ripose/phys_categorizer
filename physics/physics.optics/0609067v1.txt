Abstract

We study theoretically the eﬀect of ultraslow phase and group velocities in an anisotropic meta-

material. The ultraslow phase propagation is induced by the hyperbolic dispersion relation. While

the inherent physics underlying the slow group velocity are collective operations of the frequency

and spatial dispersion. We show that a Gaussian wave packet exhibits simultaneous slow phase

and group velocities which depend on the choice of incident angles and principal axis angles. The

anisotrocpic metamaterial slab can be constructed and the ultraslow phase and group velocities

can be measured experimentally.

INTRODUCTION

The unusual properties of the electromagnetic waves in a medium with simultaneously

permittivity ε and the permeability µ were ﬁrstly introduced by Veselago about forty years

ago [1]. The waves propagation in such media are quite counterintuitive. For example, the

direction of energy ﬂow for a plane wave is opposite to the direction of propagation. After

the ﬁrst experimental observation using a metamaterial composed of split ring resonators

(SRR) [2, 3], the study of such materials has received increasing attention over the last

few years. As noted earlier, both ε and µ are necessarily frequency dispersive in LHM.

Since the frequency dispersion is important, the superluminal [4, 5, 6] and the subluminal

propagation [6, 7, 8] in the LHM takes place.

It should be noted that we neglect bianisotropic eﬀects despite the fact that they might

be important for the characterization of some rings. While negative refraction is most

easily visualized in an isotropic metamaterial, negative refraction can also be realized in

anisotropic metamaterial, which does not necessarily require that all tensor elements of ε

and µ have negative values [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. If we just consider the spatial dispersion,

the superluminal group velocity can be expected in the AMM with hyperboloid dispersion

relation [15]. While the real AMM constructed by SRR is highly dispersive, both in spatial

and frequency sense [10, 11, 12, 13], hence It is very necessary to extend the previous work

and take the frequency dispersion into account.

In the present letter, we will investigate the simultaneous slow phase and group velocities

of wave packet in an anisotropic metamaterial. The subluminal phase propagation is induced

by the hyperbolic dispersion relations associated with the AMM. We describe a modulated

Gaussian wave packet incident on the anisotropic metamaterial, which demonstrates in

a straightforward manner that the peak of the localized wave packet displays interesting

smultaneous slow phase and group velocities.

II. HYPERBOLIC DISPERSION RELATION

It is currently well accepted that a better model is to consider anisotropic constitutive

parameters, which can be diagonalized in the coordinate system collinear with the principal

axes of the metamaterial. If we take the principal axis as the z axis, the permittivity and

where εi and µi are the relative permittivity and permeability constants in the principal

coordinate system (i = x, y, z). It should be noted that the real AMM constructed by SRR

is highly dispersive, both in spatial sense and frequency sense [10, 11, 12, 13]. So these

relative values are functions of the angle frequency ω. A general study on the shape of the

dispersion relation as function of the sign of these parameters has already been oﬀered in

Ref. [11]. In this work, we are interested in the case of AMM with hyperbolic dispersion

relation.

Without loss of generality, we assume that the wave vector locate at the x − z plane

(ky = qy = 0). Maxwell’s equations yield a scalar wave equation for E-polarized ﬁeld . In

where kx and kz are the x and z components of the incident wave vector, ω is the frequency,

and c is the speed of light in vacuum. We assume that there is an angle ϕ between the

principal axis and the z axis. For the given polarization, the waves equation yield the

dispersion relation in AMM as

(εz sin 2ϕ − εx sin 2ϕ).

The material axes are normal to the surface of the rings. The cell structure is shown in

Fig. 1. The metamaterial is formed by cutting the sheet into strips which are lined up

with the appropriate periodicity. The permeability, µz, can be approximated by the Lorentz

where ωmo, ωmp, and Γm denote the magnetic resonate frequency, plasma frequency, and

damping frequency, respectively. The characteristic resonance frequency fmo = 10.08GHz,

plasma frequency fmp = 10.56GHz and Γm = 0.1GHz (f = ω/2π). Ignoring the metallic

structure, εy and µx assume the values of the background material which is dominantly air

leading us to use εy = µx = 1 [13].

We assume here that the electric ﬁeld is polarized along the y axis. We choose to µz(ω) < 0

we ﬁnd the corresponding requency contour is a hyperbola as shown in Fig. 2, where a plane

electromagnetic wave is incident from free space into the AMM. We choose the z axis to be

normal to the interface, the x axis in the plane of the ﬁgure, and the y axis out of the plane

of the ﬁgure. Due to the angular dispersion, the transmitted wave components may refract

at slightly diﬀerent angles. The values of refracted wave vector can be found by using the

the choice of sign of qz ensures that light power propagates away from the surface to the +z

direction.

We now determine the angle of phase refraction. The incident angle of light in free space
is θI = tan−1[kx/kz] and the refraction angle of the transmitted wave vector in AMM can
be found by θT = tan−1[qx/qz]. From the boundary condition at the interface z = 0, the

tangential components of the wave vectors must be continuous, i.e., qx = kx. Thus the

refracted angle of wave vector in the AMM can be easily obtained. When the interface is

aligned an angle with the optical axes of the AMM, the hyperbolic dispersion relations will

exhibit some interesting eﬀects.

To get a deeper insight into the slow phase velocity, we plot the frequency contour in

Fig. 2. The magnitude of q varies as a function of its direction. When the refractive wave

vector q is approximately parallel to the asymptotic line of hyperbola, q can be very large.

The wave front travels in the AMM with the velocity of vp = ω/q, so the ultra-slow phase

It should be noted that a wave group can be formed from plane waves with diﬀerent

frequencies or form plane waves with diﬀerent wave vectors. Thus the diﬀerence in the

phase and group velocities can be caused by media that are dispersive or anisotropic [16].

The group velocity is a very important physical quantity because it identiﬁes the speed of

the maximum intensity of wave packet. The group velocity in anisotropic media can be

deﬁned as

permeability functions undergo large changes with frequency, which results in ∂D/∂ω ≫
∂D/∂qx and ∂D/∂ω ≫ ∂D/∂qz, hence the subluminal group velocity can be deduced.

In Fig. 4, the group velocities in the AMM with diﬀerent principal axes angle are plotted.

It should be noted that the slow group velocity in the AMM is induced by the hyperbolic dis-

persion relation. While the inherent physics underlying the slow group velocity are collective

III. SUBLUMINAL GROUP PROPAGATION

To obtain a better physical picture of subluminal group velocity in AMM, a modulated

Gaussian wave packet of ﬁnite width can be constructed. The ﬁeld intensity distribution in

free space is obtained by the Fourier integral and angular spectrum representation. Following

the method outlined by Lu et al. [17], let us consider a modulated Gaussian wavepacket is

incident from free space

d2k⊥f (k − k0) exp[i(k · r − iω(k)t],

where ω(k) = ck. we assume its Gaussian weight is

where a is the spatial extent of the incident wave packet. We want the Gaussian wave packet

to be aligned with the incident direction deﬁned by the vector k0 = k0 cos θI ex + k0 sin θIez,

which makes an angle θI with the surface normal.

FIG. 5: The temporal evolution of the Gaussian wave packet in the AMM. The center frequency

is f = 10.05GHz with the incident angle θI = −π/6. The optical axis angle ϕ = π/3 and spatial

extent of the incident wave packet is a = 10cm. The peak of localized wave packet travels from

point 1 to point 2 during the propagation time ∆t with group velocity vG ≈ c/100.

Due to the angular dispersion and the anisotropy, the transmitted wave components may

refract at slightly diﬀerent angles. When the Gaussian wave packet enters the AMM, it will

no longer maintain Gaussian, but becomes a tilted wave packet. Matching the boundary

conditions for each k component at z = 0 gives the complex ﬁeld in the form

ET (x, z) =

d2k⊥f (k − k0)T (k) exp[i(q · r − iω(q)t],

where ω(q) = cq and T (k) is the transmission coeﬃcient.

A close look at the tilted wave packet shows that the subluminal propagation of the peak

is induced by the hyperbolic dispersion relation. Fig. 5 shows a closes view of the ﬁeld

intensity distribution of the wave packet propagating in the AMM. In a propagation time

∆t, the peak of the tilted Gaussian packet travels from point 1 to point 2. In Fig. 5 we set
the center wave vector with a incident angles θI = −π/6. We mark on each position of the

peak of wave packet at each of the two times. In the ∆t = 100ns, the peak of wave packet

moves from (0, 0) to (2.45, 28.64). This propagating velocity corresponds to 28.75cm/ns,
which is almost exactly the analytical group velocity vG ≈ c/100 in Eq. (8), and the slow

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In summary, we have discussed simultaneous slow phase and group velocities of light in

an anisotropic Metamaterial. It should be noted that the slow group velocity has completely

diﬀerent origin from those described in isotropic LHM [6, 7] or ultracold gas of atoms [18, 19],

where the slow group velocity is caused by the frequency dispersion of the medium. In the

case discussed here, the inherent physics underlying the slow group velocity are collective

operations of the frequency and spatial dispersion. As far as we know, this kind of slow

group velocity has not been recognized before. It should be mentioned, however, that the

shape of Gaussian wave packet is distorted once it is incident into the AMM. It is shown

that the simultaneously slow phase and group velocities can be measured experimentally.

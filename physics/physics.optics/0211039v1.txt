We numerically study supercontinuum (SC) generation in photonic crystal ﬁbers pumped with
low-power 30-ps pulses close to the zero dispersion wavelength 647nm. We show how the eﬃciency is
signiﬁcantly improved by designing the dispersion to allow widely separated spectral lines generated
by degenerate four-wave-mixing (FWM) directly from the pump to broaden and merge. By proper
modiﬁcation of the dispersion proﬁle the generation of additional FWM Stokes and anti-Stokes lines
results in eﬃcient generation of an 800nm wide SC. Simulations show that the predicted eﬃcient
SC generation is more robust and can survive ﬁber imperfections modelled as random ﬂuctuations
of the dispersion coeﬃcients along the ﬁber length.

I. INTRODUCTION

After the ﬁrst observation of a 200-THz supercontin-
uum (SC) spectrum of light in bulk glass [1,2], much
has been done on the understanding and control of this
process [3]. A target of numerous experimental and the-
oretical investigations has been the improvement of the
characteristics and simpliﬁcation of the technical require-
ments for the generation of a SC [3]. The ﬁrst experi-
ments in bulk materials, based on self-phase modulation
(SPM), required extremely high peak powers (> 10MW).
New techniques based on the use of optical ﬁbers as a
nonlinear medium for SC generation allowed lower peak
powers to be used due to the long interaction length and
high eﬀective nonlinearity [4–7]. However, the necessity
to operate near the wavelength for zero group velocity
dispersion, restricted the SC generation to the spectral
region around and above 1.3µm. The use of dispersion-
ﬂattened or dispersion-decreasing ﬁbers as nonlinear me-
dia for SC generation resulted in a ﬂat SC spanning 1400-
1700nm [8,9] and 1450-1650nm [10], respectively. The
spectrum was still far from the visible wavelengths and
in some cases very sensitive to noise in the input [10].

Photonic crystal ﬁbers (PCF) and tapered ﬁbers over-
come these limitations. The unusual dispersion prop-
erties and enlarged eﬀective nonlinearities make them
a promising tool for eﬀective SC generation [6]. PCFs
and tapered ﬁbers have similar dispersion and nonlin-
earity characteristics and they have the advantage that
their dispersion may be signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by a proper
design of the cladding structure [11–13], or by chang-
ing the degree of tapering [14], respectively. Using kilo-
watt peakpower femtosecond pulses a SC spanning 400-
1500nm has been generated in a PCF [14] and in a ta-
pered ﬁber [15]. The broad SC was later explained to be
a result of SPM and direct degenerate four-wave-mixing
(FWM) [16].

However, high power femtosecond lasers are not nec-

essary, - SC generation may be achieved with low-power
picosecond [6,7] and even nanosecond [17] pulses. Thus
Coen et al. generated a broad SC in a PCF using picosec-
ond pulses with sub-kilowatt peakpower and showed that
the primary mechanism was the combined eﬀect of stim-
ulated Raman scattering (SRS) and parametric FWM,
allowing the Raman shifted components to interact eﬃ-
ciently with the pump [6].

Using 200 fs high power pulses and a 1cm long tapered
ﬁber, Gusakov has shown that direct degenerate FWM
can lead to ultrawide spectral broadening and pulse com-
pression [16]. We consider how the direct degenerate
FWM can signiﬁcantly improve the eﬃciency of SC gen-
eration with sub-kilowatt picosecond pulses in PCFs, and
go one step further by optimizing the eﬀect through engi-
neering of the dispersion properties of the PCF. We show
that by a proper design of the dispersion proﬁle the di-
rect degenerate FWM Stokes and anti-Stokes lines can
be shifted closer to the pump, thereby allowing them to
broaden and merge with the pump to form an ultrabroad
SC. This signiﬁcantly improves the eﬃciency of the SC
generation, since the power in the Stokes and anti-Stokes
lines no longer is lost. In particular we optimize the SC
bandwidth by designing the dispersion proﬁle to generate
additional Stokes and anti-Stokes lines around which the
SC spectrum can broaden.

External perturbations and diﬀerent types of imper-
fections lead to ﬂuctuations of the ﬁber parameters along
the length of the ﬁber. Fluctuations in ﬁber birefringence
[18,19], dispersion [21,22], and nonlinearity [23,24] has
been investigated to understand their inﬂuence on diﬀer-
ent regimes of light propagation. As parametric processes
require phase matching, the eﬀectiveness of the FWM
could be strongly inﬂuenced by random ﬂuctuations of
the dispersion. Indeed Coen et.al. in their PCF exper-
iments with low-pump picosecond pulses at 647nm [6,7]
and nanosecond pulses at 532nm [17] explains the ab-
sence of frequencies generated by direct degenerate FWM

1

The phase-mismatch for degenerate FWM of two pho-
tons at the pump frequency is: ∆β = βs+βas−2βp+2γIp
[27], where Ip is the peak power. In the frequency domain
we have:

∆β = 2(Ω

+ Ω

+ Ω

+ γIp),

(3)

2 β2
2!

4 β4
4!

6 β6
6!

where Ω = ωp − ωs = ωas − ωp. The gain g of the direct
degenerate FWM [7,27] is:

g = [(γI)2 − (∆β/2)2]1/2,

(4)

where I is the power of the frequency component around
which the degenerate FWM process takes place.

We consider the same PCF and use the same nu-
merical and experimental data as in [6], kindly pro-
vided by S. Coen. We pump along the slow axis with
30ps sech-shaped pulses of Ip = 400W peak power and
pump wavelength λp = 647nm. The PCF has core area
Acore = 1.94µm2, birefringence δn = 1.9 · 10−6, and non-
linearity n2 = 3 · 10−20m2/W. We consider six diﬀerent
dispersion proﬁles, for which β2−7 are given in Table I,
where case d1 corresponds to the PCF used in [6]. Note
that cases d4+d6 and d5 have two and three sets of Stokes
and anti-Stokes waves, respectively.

Here we are interested in studying the separate eﬀect of
diﬀerent dispersion proﬁles (i.e. diﬀerent values of β2−7).
We therefore keep all other ﬁber and pulse parameters
constant and neglect the frequency dependence of the
eﬀective area Aef f and the loss µ. Thus we assume a
uniform loss of µ = 0.1dB/m and approximate Aef f with
the core area, so that γ = 2n2/(λpAcore) = 0.15(Wm)−1.

from the pump, by the large frequency shift and the vi-
olation of the required phase-matching condition due to
ﬁber irregularities. We analyze the inﬂuence of a ran-
dom change of the dispersion coeﬃcients along the ﬁber
on the process of SC generation and ﬁnd that the gener-
ation and merging of the direct degenerate FWM Stokes
and anti-Stokes waves with the pump could be robust
enough to survive ﬁber imperfections, and thus a signiﬁ-
cant improvement of the process of SC generation should
indeed be possible in real PCFs.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL AND FIBER DATA.

We study numerically the SC generation process us-
ing the well known coupled nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS)
equations that describe the evolution of the x- and y-
polarization components of the ﬁeld for pulses with a
spectral width of up to 1/3 of the pump frequency [6,25],

Here the complex ﬁelds Aj = Aj(t, z) with j = 1, 2 are
given by A1 = Ex and A2 = Ey exp(iδβz), where Ex
and Ey are the envelopes of the real linearly polarized
x- and y-components. The time τ = t − z/v is in a
reference frame moving with the average group velocity
v−1 = (v−1
x )/2, z is the propagation coordinate
along the ﬁber, µ is the ﬁber loss, δβ = βx − βy = ω0δn/c
is the phase mismatch due to birefringence δn = nx − ny,
and ∆ = (v−1
y ) is the group velocity mismatch be-
tween the two polarization axes. The propagation con-
stant β(ω) is expanded to 8th order around the pump
frequency ωp with coeﬃcients βk keeping β2−7 same for
x- and y-linearly polarized components, γ is the eﬀec-
tive nonlinearity, fR is the fractional contribution of the
Raman eﬀect, and ﬁnally ∗ denotes complex conjugation.
This model accounts for SPM, cross-phase-modulation,
FWM, and SRS. For the Raman susceptibility hR we
include only the parallel component, as the orthogonal
component is generally negligible in most of the fre-
quency regime that we consider [26]. The Raman sus-
ceptibility is approximated by the expression [27]:

hR(t) =

exp(−t/τ2) sin(t/τ1),

(2)

where τ1 = 12.2fs and τ2 = 32fs. Furthermore, fR = 0.18
is estimated from the known numerical value of the peak
Raman gain [27].

For our numerical simulation, we use the standard sec-
ond order split-step Fourier method, solving the nonlin-
ear part with a fourth order Runge-Kutta method us-
ing a Fourier transform forth and back and the convolu-
tion theorem. Except where otherwise stated, we use 217
points in a time window of T = 236ps, giving the wave-
length window (405 − 1613nm). The propagation step is
∆z = 43µm. In our longest simulation out to L = 3.7m
the photon number is conserved to within 5% of its ini-
tial value. An initial random phase noise seeding of one
photon per mode is included as in [6]. All the presented
spectra have been smoothed over 32 points.

III. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS.

We ﬁrst simulate SC generation using the same ﬁber
as in [6], i.e., using the dispersion proﬁle d1. Due to
our large spectral window (405 − 1613nm), we see in
Fig. 1 (left) the emergence of direct-degenerate FWM
Stokes and anti-Stokes waves at the predicted wave-
lengths λs = 1100nm and λas = 458nm, for which the
phase matching condition (3) is satisﬁed. From the stan-
dard expressions given in [27] we ﬁnd the maximum di-
rect degenerate FWM gain (g) to be twice the maximum
SRS gain, which explains why the FWM Stokes and anti-
Stokes components appear before the SRS components.

trum at L=20cm, 30cm, 1m, 2m, and 3.7m (down to up).

For a given peak power, the loss and temporal walk-
oﬀ of the PCF gives the maximum distance Lmax over
which nonlinear processes, and thus the SC generation
process, are eﬃcient. From Fig. 1 (left) we see that

3

after the FWM Stokes and anti-Stokes components are
generated they broaden in the same way as the central
part of the spectrum around the pump. The merging of
the spectral parts around λas, λp, and λs would create
an ultra broad spectrum as observed in tapered ﬁbers
with high power femtosecond pulses [15,16]. However,
for high power femtosecond pulses the SPM is the dom-
inant mechanism that leads to broadening and merging
of the Stokes and anti-Stokes lines with the pump. For
low power picosecond pulses the Raman and parametric
processes are dominant. Thus, in this particular case,
the large frequency shift ∼ 193THz of the degenerate
FWM sidebands and the narrow degenerate FWM gain
bands ∼ 2THz prevent merging of the pump with the
Stokes and anti-Stokes lines to happen within the max-
imum length Lmax, i.e., before nonlinear eﬀects become
negligible. Indeed it is seen from Fig.1, that the spec-
trum does not change signiﬁcantly from 1m to 3.7m. The
power transferred to the Stokes and anti-Stokes lines is
in eﬀect lost, i.e., the SC process is not very eﬃcient.

FIG. 2. Dispersion proﬁle d1 (thick solid line), d2 (dashed

d6 (thin solid line).

By increasing the peak power, it would be possible to
achieve merging of the spectral parts around λas, λp,
and λs. However, our aim is to keep the low peak power
ﬁxed and instead achieve this merging only by engineer-
ing the dispersion proﬁle. Thus we modify the dispersion
proﬁle to adjust Eq. (3) to be fulﬁlled for wavelengths
λs and λas closer to the pump λp = 647nm. We do
so by modifying β2, β4, and β6 as listed in Table I. The
phase-matching condition ∆β = 0 then gives λs = 852nm
and λas = 521nm for case d2-d3.
In case d4-d6 addi-
tional Stokes and anti-Stokes waves exist. The dispersion
proﬁles and phase-mismatch curves corresponding to the
cases in Table I are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, respec-
tively. It is important to note that the curves ∆β(λ) have
diﬀerent slope around λs and λas (see Fig. 3).

We ﬁrst consider only a shift of the Stokes and anti-
Stokes lines closer to the pump and the eﬀect it has on
the improvement of the SC generation. Thus, for the
dispersion proﬁle d2, the slope of the phase mismatch
curve around λs = 852nm and λas = 521nm is kept the
same as for case d1. It is seen from Fig. 1 (right) that
such a shift of the direct degenerate FWM Stokes and
anti-Stokes lines closer to the pump is not enough for a
complete merging to take place. This can be explained by
considering the direct degenerate FWM gain g(λ) shown
in Fig. 4. The broadening of the Stokes and anti-Stokes
lines is strongly inﬂuenced by the bandwidth of g(λ),
which is mainly determined by the slope around ∆β = 0,
i.e., around λs and λas. The slope and thus the gain
bandwidth is the same in case d1 and d2, which explains
why the broadening appears to be unchanged.

FIG. 3. Phase mismatch ∆β(λ) for dispersion proﬁle d1
(thick solid line), d2 (dashed line), d3 (dash-dotted line), d4
(dotted line), d5 (circles), and d6 (thin solid line).

One way to improve the SC spectrum is to shift the
Stokes and anti-Stokes lines even closer to the pump,
keeping the slope of the phase mismatch curve around
them constant. However, this will not signiﬁcantly im-
prove the width of the SC spectrum as compared to
case d1, because the narrow direct degenerate FWM gain
bands will then be in the region, where a SC is already
generated by Raman and FWM processes. Moreover,
this will lead to even more unusual dispersion proﬁles
than that for case d2 (see Fig. 2), which does not seem
to be experimentally realistic.

Instead we ﬁx λs and λas while reducing the slope and
thus increasing the gain bandwidth. For dispersion pro-
ﬁle d3 the direct degenerate FWM gain bandwidth is
thus increased to 16.5THz (see Fig. 4). This leads to
broader Stokes and anti-Stokes lines in the initial stages
of the SC generation and ﬁnally to their merging with the
spectrum around the pump as seen from Fig. 5 (right).

Thus a SC, which is ﬂat within 10dB and extending from
around 500nm to 900nm is formed after a propagation
distance of L = 2m despite using low-power picosecond
pulses. Moreover, the dispersion proﬁle d3 is more real-
istic, i.e., closer to a real PCF dispersion proﬁle, such as
proﬁle d1.

such that the phase-mismatch ∆β(λ) has two or even
three sets of Stokes and anti-Stokes lines, i.e. roots of the
polynomium (3). The dispersion proﬁles d4 and d5 rep-
resents such cases with two and three sets of Stokes and
anti-Stokes lines, respectively, around which the spec-
trum can broaden. From the corresponding gain curves
in Fig. 4 we see that two gain bands actually overlap
and form one broad gain band. The presence of extra
Stokes and anti-Stokes lines and the broad gain band
could make the SC generation more eﬃcient, provided
they do not deplete the pump so much that the central
SC spectrum aroud the pump deteriorates.

From Fig. 6 (left) we see that with the dispersion pro-
ﬁle d4 the initial stage of the SC generation is indeed im-
proved, the spectrum at L=10cm mainly reﬂecting the
gain proﬁle seen in Fig. 4. However, the small dip in
the gain curve around 950nm has a strong eﬀect on the
evolution of the spectrum, leaving a clear dip at 930nm
in the ﬁnal SC spectrum. Optimizing the position of the
two Stokes lines can remove this dip and lead to an even
broader SC spectrum than observed in Fig. 5 for one set
of Stokes and anti-Stokes lines.

the dispersion proﬁle may be optimized further to remove

spectrum at L=20cm, 30cm, 1m, and 2m (down to up).

So far we have only considered the Stokes and anti-
Stokes lines generated directly from the pump through
degenerate FWM. However, so-called cascaded FWM
processes play also an important role in the evolution of
the spectrum, as discussed thoroughly in [6]. In particu-
lar, one can use these processes to obtain a broader SC.
The dispersion proﬁle d6 is designed to clearly illustrate
this eﬀect.
It still implies two sets of Stokes and anti-
Stokes lines, but now these are very close to the pump,
within the regime of wavelengths covered by the central
SC generated by the pump. Nevertheless we see in Fig. 7
(right) that additional lines are generated, around which
the spectrum broadens, resulting in a ﬁnal SC spectrum
extending from 450nm to 1µm within 10dB. The line at
1030nm is generated by direct degenerate FWM from the
Stokes wave at 720nm, and the line at 1060nm is gener-
ated by FWM between the Stokes wave at 720nm and the
pump. Thus these cascaded parametric processes result
in a spectrum, which is broader than what was obtained
with the direct degenerate FWM process in case d3.

Many investigations on designing the dispersion pro-
ﬁle in PCFs have been made [11–13].
In [12] a well-
deﬁned procedure to design speciﬁc predetermined dis-
persion proﬁles is established and it is shown that it is
possible to obtain ﬂattened dispersion proﬁles giving nor-
mal, anomalous, and zero dispersion in both the telecom-
munication window (around 1.55µm) and the T i − Za
laser wavelength range (around 0.8µm). This allows us
to conclude that the dispersion proﬁles d3-d5 shown in
Fig. 2 could indeed be fabricated. However, it is out-

IV. ROBUSTNESS OF SCG TO FIBER
IRREGULARITIES

The SC generation process that we have considered
here is mainly determined by parametric FWM, which re-
quires phase-matching. In the experiments with a PCF
with dispersion proﬁle d1 [6,7] Stokes and anti-Stokes
lines due to direct degenerate FWM were generally not
observed. This was explained to be due to irregularities
along the PCF, leading to violation of the required phase
matching condition (3). Thus, in order to conclude that
parametric FWM can be used for broad-band SC genera-
tion in real PCFs, we check the robustness of the process
towards ﬂuctuations of the dispersion coeﬃcients along
the ﬁber.

It has indeed been shown experimentally that a vari-
ation of the zero-dispersion wavelength λz of the order
of 0.1nm over the entire length of a dispersion shifted
ﬁber could signiﬁcantly reduce the FWM eﬃciency [20].
This reduction in the FWM eﬃciency was later explained
theoretically from expressions for the average parametric
gain, phase-conjugation eﬃciency, and gain band-width
[21]. It has also been shown that in order to control the
dispersion within ±1ps/(km·nm), the allowable deviation
of the core radius in W-type dispersion-ﬂattened ﬁbers
is 0.04µm, while for other types of dispersion-ﬂattened
ﬁbers the allowable core radius deviation is 0.1µm [22].
As PCFs have an even more complex structure, strong
ﬂuctuation of the ﬁber dispersion could be expected too.
However, to our knowledge a thorough study of the in-
ﬂuence of ﬂuctuations of the PCF parameters (e.g., core
size and pitch) on the variation of the dispersion proﬁle
(i.e. the dispersion coeﬃcients β2−7) is not available.

For a newly developed highly nonlinear PCF with
λz=1.55µm, it was recently shown that the variation of
λz is only 6nm and the variation of the dispersion slope
at λz, D′
z = dD(λz)/dλ, varies between -0.25 and -0.27
ps/(km·nm2) over a 150m span [13]. Expanding the prop-
agation constant to third order around the pump wave-
length λp=647nm, the dispersion has the form

k = 1, 2.

(7)

Note that the relative variations of β2 and β3 are equal.
We model the eﬀect of a ﬂuctuating dispersion proﬁle
by imposing that δβ, ∆, and all the dispersion coeﬃcients
β2−7 [see Eq. (1)] vary randomly along the ﬁber,

δβ(z) = δβ + σ0(z),
∆(z) = ∆ + σ1(z),

βk,x(z) = βk + σk,x(z),
βk,y(z) = βk + σk,y(z),

where k=2,..,7. The random ﬂuctuation of the coeﬃ-
cients, represented by the σ-terms, is modelled as Gaus-
sian distributed white noise with zero mean. To achieve
the most severe case we use diﬀerent seeds for all terms.
We have thus assumed that the ﬂuctuations aﬀect the dis-
persion in the two birefringent axis independently. With
the results from Ref. [13] in mind we assume that the
strength (or variance) of the ﬂuctuations is the same in
all coeﬃcients,

and use the strength ρ=10%.

Random ﬂuctuations of the whole dispersion proﬁle
will randomly vary not only the zero-dispersion wave-
length λz, but more importantly, the phase-mismatch
curve ∆β(λ), given by Eq. (3). This in turn implies that
the FWM gain spectrum g(∆β), given by Eq. (4), will
vary randomly along the ﬁber, even in the undepleted
pump approximation (constant peak power Ip).

In Fig. 8 we have depicted the ﬂuctuation of the FWM
Stokes gain band in the undepleted pump approximation
over the ﬁrst L=1mm of a PCF with dispersion proﬁles
d1 (λs=1110nm) and d3 (λs=852nm). As expected the
broader gain band of ﬁber d3 is reﬂected in a suppression
of the oscillations, as compared to the ﬁber d1 used in
the experiments in [6].

The variation of the direct degenerate FWM Stokes
gain band gives an impression of the inﬂuence of the dis-
persion ﬂuctuations on the eﬀectiveness of the FWM pro-
cess. The important factor is the average FWM gain over
the ﬁber length L, deﬁned as

show the average FWM Stokes gain calculated over the
ﬁrst L=2cm using the undepleted pump approximation.
The reduction of the average gain for increasing strength
of the ﬂuctuations can be clearly observed.

Theoretically we thus predict that in ﬁber d1 realistic
ﬂuctuations would signiﬁcantly suppress the Stokes and
anti-Stokes lines generated from the pump by direct de-
generate FWM, as also stated by Coen et al. [6]. The cor-
responding simulations, presented in Fig. 10 (left), con-
ﬁrms this prediction. Using direct degenerate FWM to
generate an ultra-broad SC in the particular ﬁber d1 is
therefore not realistic.

In contrast, with our proposed ﬁber d3 with a broad
gain band, even ﬂuctuations with ρ=10% should not sig-
niﬁcantly reduce the FWM eﬀectiveness, which is also
conﬁrmed by our simulations shown in Fig. 10 (right).
In our proposed ﬁbers d4-d5 the FWM gain band is even
broader, indicating that ﬂuctuations will have even less
impact. Thus our numerical results show that using di-
rect degenerate FWM to generate an ultra-broad SC in
really a realistic option.

V. CONCLUSION

We have numerically investigated SC generation in
birefringent PCFs using 30-picosecond pulses with 400-
kilowatt peak power. Our results show that by properly
designing the dispersion proﬁle and using the generation,
broadening, and ﬁnal merging of widely separated pump
and FWM Stokes and anti-Stokes lines the SC gener-
ation eﬃciency can be signiﬁcantly improved, resulting
in a broader SC spectrum and a reduced loss of power
to frequencies outside the SC. Thus, by optimising the
dispersion proﬁle, we have generated an ultra-broad SC
ranging from 450nm to 1250nm within the 20dB level.

We have shown that the key issue is to make sure
that the Stokes and anti-Stokes lines are generated close
enough to the pump to be able to broaden and merge
with the central (pump) part of the SC before nonlinear
processes are suppressed due to ﬁber loss and temporal
walk-oﬀ. We have also shown that this in turn requires
the FWM gain band to be suﬃciently broad, which is an
essential property of our designed dispersion proﬁles.

We have ﬁnally investigated the robustness of the SC
generation process in our proposed ﬁbers towards ﬂuc-
tuations in the parameters along the ﬁber. Such ﬂuctu-
ation could be detrimental to the phase-sensitive FWM
process, which depends on the degree of phase-matching.
Simulations including random ﬂuctuations of the disper-
sion proﬁle along the ﬁber show that the broad FWM
gain band of our proposed ﬁbers improve the robustness
and that the process of eﬃcient SC generation survives
random ﬂuctuations of a realistic strength.

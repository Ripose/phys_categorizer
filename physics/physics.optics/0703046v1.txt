Abstract

Spontaneous emission of an atom (molecule) placed near a nanocylin-
der of elliptical cross-section of an arbitrary composition is studied. The
analytical expressions have been obtained for the radiative and nonradia-
tive channels of spontaneous decay and investigated in details.

1 Introduction

As was ﬁrst pointed out by Purcell [1] one can change the atomic decay rate by
using a resonant cavity. It is well known now that not only resonant cavities,
but also any material body may exert inﬂuence on the spontaneous decay rate
[2]. Moreover, control for the spontaneous decay rate is widely used in practice
at elaboration of new eﬃcient light sources [3].

Due to rapid development of nanotechnologies inﬂuence of nanoparticles
of diﬀerent shapes on radiation of atoms, molecules and nanocrystal quantum
dots is of key importance. This direction often referred to as nanophotonics
[4].
Inﬂuence of spherical [5]-[7], spheroidal [8]-[10] and even ellipsoidal [11]
nanoparticle on radiation of atoms and molecules is investigated in details.

Of special interest is the inﬂuence of dielectric ﬁbers or metallic wires of
diﬀerent cross-sections on the decay rate of a single atom. This is because the
charged wires were employed successfully in order to control the atomic motion
[12, 13]. The cylindrical geometry is also important for the investigation of
ﬂuorescence of substances in submicron capillaries [14, 15]. A very important
application of the decay rate theory in the presence of dielectric ﬁber had been
in the case of the photonic wire lasers [16]-[19]. Finally, the circular cylindrical
geometry appears naturally at analysis of the carbon nanotubes [20, 21].

The inﬂuence of a perfectly conducting cylindrical surface on decay rates
has been well investigated for an atom placed both inside a cylindrical cavity

[22]-[25] and near a perfectly conducting cylinder [26]. Spontaneous emission of
an atom located inside a coaxial waveguide was considered in [27].

The interaction of an atom with a dielectric, semiconductor, or a metallic
cylinder is a more complicated process. Van der Waals interaction between an
atom and a circular metallic nanowire was considered in [28]. The ﬁrst inves-
tigation of the decay rate of an atom placed at the axis of a circular dielectric
ﬁber was undertaken within a classical approach in [29, 30]. Recently that prob-
lem attracted new interest [31]-[36]. In [37, 38] the spontaneous emission near
carbon nanotubes was considered.

Recently non-circular nanocylinders (the so called nanobelts or nanoribbons)
were successfully synthesized [39]-[43]. Figure 1 illustrates the experimentally
obtained nanobelts [39].

The signiﬁcance of studying such nanoobjects is very great because they
form the basis for the synthesis of all kinds of nanodevices, such as nano-scale
transducers, actuators, or sensors [44]-[47]. The inﬂuence of such structures on
optical characteristics of atoms and molecules had not been yet considered, as
far as we know.

The aim of this work is to investigate theoretically the inﬂuence of dielectric
and metallic cylinders of elliptical cross-section on the spontaneous emission of
atoms and molecules placed close to the cylinder. This geometry is close to
synthesized nanobelts and nanoribbons.

Though it is possible to separate variables in the Helmholtz equation within
the elliptic cylinder coordinates, still the electrodynamics and optics of the di-
electric elliptic cylinder remain insuﬃciently studied, due to mathematical dif-
ﬁculties concerned with the Mathieu function [48]. In this paper we shall try
to make up for this deﬁciency, and shall report the investigation results deal-
ing with the spontaneous emission of the atom placed near an inﬁnite elliptic
cylinder.

Some elements of the theory for a spontaneous decay of an atom near ma-
terial bodies will be presented in section 2, where the main attention will be
paid to the nanobodies, whose dimensions are small as compared to the radia-
tion wavelength. In section 3, we report solution on a problem of spontaneous
decay of an atom near the perfectly conducting elliptic cylinder with arbitrarily
sized cross-section when retardation eﬀects can be important. In section 4, the
radiative and nonradiative channels of a decaying atom located near an elliptic
nanocylinder, which is made of an arbitrary material, will be considered analyt-
ically within the quasistatic approach. The results obtained in sections 3 and 4
will be analyzed and illustrated graphically in section 5. The geometry of the
problem under study is illustrated in Fig.2.

2 Some elements of the theory for the sponta-
neous emission of an atom placed near the
nanobodies

At weak coupling of an atom and a nanobody, i.e. in the case of the exponential
spontaneous decay, the expression for the linewidth γa of excited level a has the
form [49]:

γa = γa,0 +

Xβ=1

In Eqs. (1) and (2), α, β = 1, 2, 3 are the indices of the Cartesian axes, and Θ is
the Heaviside’s unit-step function. Note that Eq.(1) has been obtained within
the framework of the most general assumptions (Fermi’s golden rule and the
ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem), and has a very large domain of applicability.
From Eq.(1) it is seen that total linewidth is the sum of partial widths, and
below we shall consider, for simplicity, the rate of transitions between some two
states only.

In the case of the nanobodies one can use the Rayleigh’s perturbation long
wavelength theory. The Green’s function of the reﬂected ﬁeld may be repre-
sented as the power series in the wave vector [50]:

Gαβ (r, r′

; ω) = G(0)

αβ (r, r′

) + kG(1)

αβ (r, r′

) + k2G(2)

αβ (r, r′

) + ik3G(3)

αβ (r, r′

) + . . . (3)

where G(j)
αβ (j=0, 1, 2, . . . ) are the coeﬃcients that can be found from a solution
of the corresponding quasistatic problems; k = ω/c. The ﬁrst three terms (3)
describe the near ﬁelds, while the radiation ﬁelds emerge starting from the
4th term. By substituting Eq.(3) into (1) for the total rate of spontaneous
decay γe−→g from the state e into g near the nanobody, we obtain the following
expression:

nonzero for the absorbing media only, whereas the rest of the terms are nonzero
in the absence of absorption as well (the dielectric or the perfectly conducting
nanobodies). Those terms describe mostly the radiative losses. Thus, to deter-
mine the main terms of the nonradiative and radiative losses it is necessary to
αβ (r′,r′), respectively.
determine G(0)

αβ (r′,r′) and G(3)

It is a complex problem to determine directly the radiative losses described
by the 3-d order terms by k. But in the case of an atom localized close to
a nanobody the radiation is dipole-like, and the total dipole moment of the
αβ (r,r′) at large distances
atom + nanobody system could be found from G(0)
from the system. Thus, in the case of the nanobodies the radiative rate of the
spontaneous transition (the transition from e into g) will be described by [35]:

γradiative
γ0

= |

2
d0 + δd
|
d2

,

(5)

where dtotal = d0 + δd is the total dipole moment of the atom + nanobody
system, and δd is the dipole moment induced in the nanobody. Here we will
omit superscript eg in transition dipole moment deg
0 and in γe−→g and γ0,e−→g.
It should be noted that beside the radiative and nonradiative chanels of
the spontaneous decay for a dielectric cylinder (and for any dielectric waveg-
uided structure) one must take into account energy transfer into the waveg-
uided modes. In case of the dielectric (nonmetallic) nanobodies that correction
is exponentially small [35] and may be neglected. But in case of the complex
dielectric permittivity of a nanocylinder (real metals), the spontaneous decay
waveguiding rate may be no longer a small value, and that correction should be
taken into account.

Thus, to describe the decay rate of an atom in the presence of a nanobody
one should determine the reﬂected ﬁeld Er in a quasistatic approximation, and
the dipole moment δd induced in the nanobody. For a nanocylinder which size
is comparable with radiation wavelength one should use full set of Maxwell’s
equations to ﬁnd the reﬂected ﬁeld.

Atom is placed in close proximity to surface of a cylinder

In the most interesting case of an atom placed in close proximity to the
surface of a cylinder (u′
u0 ). The decay rate of a tangentially to surface
oriented dipole tends to zero. The nonzero rate of decays is possible if the dipole
moment orientation is normal to the cylindrical surface, i.e. for the dipole that
is oriented along the u-coordinate line

When elliptic cylinder radius is tending to zero kf u0 →

0, the decay rate (34)
of a tangentially to surface oriented dipole tends to zero the main contribution
to the decay rates of normally oriented dipole is due to the terms with n = 0
and n = 1 of (34). By expanding the expressions (10) and (11) into series at
0 (the procedure of ﬁnding the expansions for the coeﬃcients Bσm

Spontaneous decay rate of an atom near el-
liptic nanocylinder made of arbitrary material

In the case of the dielectric or metallic cylinder of arbitrary dimensions and
arbitrary permittivity ε the problem of the spontaneous decay rate of an atom
may also be solved analytically [54]. But such a solution is so cumbersome
that it is very diﬃcult to use it practically. In this section we restrict ourselves
to a practically important case of a nanoﬁber or a metal nanowire of elliptical
cross-section. It may be easy to describe the spontaneous decay, in this case.

4.1 The rate of the radiative decays

In order to ﬁnd the spontaneous radiative decay rate of an atom placed at point
r′ near to elliptic nanocylinder of arbitrary material it is necessary to calculate a
dipole moment induced in a nanocylinder, in accordance with Eq.(5). In order to

13

ﬁnd the dipole moment one may use the found analytical solution [11] for three-
axis ellipsoid and turn one of the semi-axes to the inﬁnity (without using the
elliptic cylinder coordinates). As a result, the expression for the induced dipole
moment on the elliptic cylinder made of material with the dielectric constant ε
with semi-axes a and b on the x- and y-axes, respectively (Fig.2), will take the
form:

which is independent of the atomic position inside the nanocylinder. In deriving
(47) we neglect the local ﬁeld factor [55]. It should be noted that formula (47)
in agreement with that obtained in [56] for the case of two-dimensional ellipse
(to obtain that result we must substitute in (47) d0,z = 0). It also be noted,
that expression (47) can be applied to describe of an atom in elliptic cylindrical
cavity in material with permittivity ε0. In this case one should make substitution
ε

1/ε0 and multiply the obtained expression by √ε0.
Note that Eqs.

(45) and (46) have been derived as a limiting case of a
ﬁnite-size ellipsoid with ﬁxed permittivity. These formulae are unsuitable for
describing the radiative decay rate of atoms near conducting (metallic) cylinder,
because the waveguided modes (plasmon modes) of the inﬁnite cylinder had
not been taken into account. The correct expression for the case of perfectly
conducting cylinder is given in Eq.(35).

4.2 The rate of nonradiative decays

In accordance with section 2, the rate of nonradiative decays of an atom near a
nanobody is determined by a quasistatic solution of the problem near an elliptic
nanocylinder. A Green’s function of the Laplace equation expressed in ellipti-
cal coordinates may be obtained from the Green’s function of the Helmholtz
equation (the ﬁrst terms in the right-hand side of Eqs. (8) and (9)) in the limit
0. As a result of such a procedure in the region u0 < u < u′ the expression
k
for the scalar Green’s function may be written in the form

(48)

It should be noted here that function Sσn (iαf, v), as follows from (10) and
(11), is the real function because the coeﬃcients Bσn (iαf ) are real. Func-
tions Jσn (iαf, u) and H (1)σn (iαf, u) are either real or imaginary depending
on the parity of n. The product Jσn (iαf, u) H (1)σn (iαf, u′) is always purely
imaginary. Hence, the right-hand side of Eq.(48) is the real function.

Using Eq.(48) one can obtain a quasistatic solution for the potential of a di-
electric nanocylinder, with dielectric constant ε, excited by the point-like dipole
source located at the point with (u′, v′, z) coordinates. The solution for the
potential φr induced in space near the cylinder has the form:

For metallic elliptic cylinders with low losses (ε = ε′ + iε′′; ε′ < 0, ε′′

)
|
denominator of (50) becomes close to zero for some longitudinal wavenumbers
(plasmon modes). In this case quasistatic approximation is not valid and one
should use full set of Maxwell’s equations. In the case of elliptic nanocylinder
made of real metals (ε = ε′ + iε′′, ε′′
1) or dielectrics the denominator of
∼
(50) is always nonzero and quasistatic approximation is valid in this case. So
we restrict ourselves for the case of dielectric elliptic nanocylinders made of real
metals or dielectrics.

By calculating the reﬂected ﬁeld Er =

(metallic) nanocylinder.

5 Graphic illustrations and discussion of results

Let us ﬁrst consider an atom near a dielectric nanocylinder. Figure 4 illustrates
the radiative rate of the spontaneous decay (45) and (46) near the dielectric
nanocylinder. As an atom moves away from the surface the decay rate tends
to the value, which is corresponds to the case of an atom in free space in the
absence of a nanobody. As the dielectric constant of the nanocylinder material is
increased, the radiative rate for the normally oriented dipole moment of an atom
increases by tending to large (ﬁnite) value, and for the tangentially oriented
dipole moment it decreases by tending to low values (zero). The most increase
in the decay rate occurs for the normally-oriented atom in the direction of the
larger semi-axis (Fig.4(a)).

From Fig.5 it is seen how the decay rate changes for an atom located in
close proximity to the surface of a nanocylinder depending on the ratio between
the a and b elliptic semi-axes. If one of the nanocylinder semi-axes tends to
zero (the case of a dielectric nanobelt) then from (45) and (46) it follows that
ε2 for the normally-oriented dipole moment of an atom placed
γradiative/γ0 →
at the belt edge, while for the tangential orientation of the dipole moment we
1/ε2 (Fig.5(a)). For the atom placed at the belt facet,
obtain γradiative/γ0 →

18

independent of the dipole moment orientation, we obtain γradiative/γ0 →
(Fig.5(b)).

Figure 6 illustrates radiative and nonradiative rates of the spontaneous decay
as the function of the distance of an atom to the surface of the dielectric elliptic
nanocylinder having the permittivity ε = 3 + i10−8. The atom is shifted along
the x-axis and its dipole moment is oriented along this axis. To calculate the
Mathieu functions we have used of the method [59] based on the solution of the
generalized eigen-value problem for the coeﬃcients Bσm
n . The integration of
(51)-(53) was performed by the mean-value method using the Aitken’s process
[60] for acceleration of the integral convergence. As seen from Fig.6 the radiative
rate of the spontaneous decay for a dielectric with a very small imaginary part
of permittivity is dominating, as a whole, over a nonradiative rate, and takes
maximal values at the cylinder surface. But if the atom is placed very close to
the nanocylinder surface, the nonradiative rate exceeds over the radiative one,
and at u′ = u0 it turns to the inﬁnity, as follows from the asymptotic expression
(54) depicted by dotted line in Fig. 6. Let us determine the distance, on which
the radiative and nonradiative rates for the normally oriented dipole moment of
an atom coincide. By equating (45) with (54), for the case of a small imaginary
part of the permittivity ε = ε′ + iε′′ of a cylinder (ε′′

ε′), we get that at

the nonradiative contribution to decay rate is equal to the radiative one. For
the case represented in Fig.6 we obtain: (x′

that one may actually neglect here the nonradiative processes. If the atom is
y-shifted and has the dipole moment oriented along this axis, then from (55) we

Figure 7 illustrates decay rates for a silver nanocylinder with ε =

3.02 +
i0.21 (λ = 373 nm [61]). The ratio of the elliptical semi-axes is a/b=3 and
a=6 nm (ka
0.1). As is well seen, the region nearby cylinder, where the
nonradiative rate is greater than radiative, is essentially wider that the region
represented in Fig.6. This is due to a larger imaginary part of permittivity
of the nanocylinder material. At small distances from the cylinder surface the
nonradiative rate of the spontaneous decay increases in accordance with (54)
(dotted line of Fig.7), and at large distances from the cylinder surface, it tends
to zero.

Now let us consider the case of a perfectly conducting cylinder. The integra-
tion of Eqs. (17)-(26) was performed by the method of mean values with using
the Aitken’s process. Figure 8 illustrates the spontaneous decay rate of an atom
placed near a perfectly conducting elliptic cylinder (ka = 1), as the function
of the atom’s position along the larger semi-axis a. As is seen, the decay rate

(55)

(56)

19

achieves the maximum in close proximity to the cylinder surface (u′ = u0) for
the normally oriented dipole moment of an atom (x-line of Fig.7(a) or y-line of
Fig.8(b)). For the tangentially oriented dipole moment we obtain zero at the
surface of the cylinder (y-line of Fig.8(a) or x-line of Fig.8(b), and also z–line)
resulting from a full compensation of the dipole moment of an atom. As the
ratio of semi-axes increases (when the smaller semi-axis b decreases) the max-
imum rate of the spontaneous decay is increased (cf. x-lines in Fig.8(a) and
Fig.8(b)) and tends to inﬁnitely large values in the limit of b
0, which agrees
with the asymptotic formula (35) for the nanocylinder.

→

Figure 9 illustrates the spontaneous decay rate of an atom placed near a
perfectly conducting elliptic cylinder (ka = 1) as the function of the atomic
displacement along y-axis (towards a smaller semi-axis). The decay rate achieves
the maximal value (normal orientation of the dipole moment) and the minimal
value (tangential orientation) at the surface of a cylinder. At high values of
the semi-axes ratio, the curves y and z (Fig.9(b) for a/b = 100
1) look like
the well known solutions [58] for the spontaneous decay rate of an atom near
a perfectly conducting plane surface with the normal (curve y) and tangential
(curve z) orientations of the dipole moment. The maximum value of the decay
rate here is about 2. The behavior of decay rate of an atom with x orientation of
dipole momentum is slightly diﬀerent from the case of the plane mirror because
of edge eﬀects in case of strip.

Figure 10 illustrates the decay rate of an atom placed in close proximity to
the surface of a perfectly conducting cylinder (u′ = u0). The dipole moment is
oriented normally to the cylinder surface along the larger semi-axis (Fig.10(a))
and along the smaller semi-axis (Fig.10(b)). As seen from Fig.10, the expression
0 for the atom with normal orientation, tends
(35) obtained in the case of ka
to inﬁnitely large values, which disagrees with the ﬁnite values derived from the
quasistatic expression (45) in the limit of ε
. This diﬀerence follows from
the fact that the amplitude of the surface current propagating along the cylinder
0 increases inﬁnitely large [26]. In other words, perfectly conducting
at ka
cylinder of inﬁnitely small cross-section is a kind of antenna, which is eﬀectively
excited by a point dipole (atom). This means that the induced dipole moment of
the perfectly conducting cylinder and the rate of spontaneous decay of an atom
0 (see Eq.(36)). The analogous process is also
also tend to inﬁnity at ka
observed in the case of a circular nanocylinder (dotted line in Fig.10, Eq.(37)).
Figure 11 illustrates a comparison for the rate of spontaneous decay (16)
obtained by numerical integration (34) and an asymptotic expression (35) for
the atom with the normally oriented dipole moment in close proximity to the
surface (u′ = u0) of perfectly conducting cylinder. As it seen, the asymptotic
expression agrees well with the numerical data up to ka = 1. It can, therefore, be
suitable for a fast evaluation of the spontaneous decay rate near the nanocylinder
and for veriﬁcation of the numerical solution.

6 Conclusion

Thus, in this paper we obtained the analytical expressions for the radiative
rate of the spontaneous decay of an atom near a dielectric nanocylinder of
elliptical cross-section within the framework of a quasistatic approximation.
The retardation eﬀects are taken into account for the spontaneous decay of an
atom near a perfectly conducting elliptic cylinder, where the analytical solution
can be found at arbitrary parameters of the problem. Special attention is paid
to the case of a nanocylinder where the largest semi-axis of the cylinder is
much less than wavelength. It is shown that a decrease in the cross-section of a
metallic (perfectly conducting) nanocylinder leads to an inﬁnite increase in the
spontaneous decay rate for a normally oriented dipole moment of the atom. A
simple asymptotic expression for the spontaneous decay rate has been obtained
in the case of a perfectly conducting nanocylinder. For the atom placed in close
proximity to a belt edge one can obtain arbitrary large values of the decay rate
by means of tuning elliptic semi-axes. The obtained results can be used for
checking the numerical solution in a more complex case of the dielectric elliptic
cylinder. The results of this work may be also helpful at studying an interaction
of atoms (molecules) with nanobelts and nanoribbons.

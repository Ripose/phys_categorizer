We consider the general form of the linear transformation for point rotation coordinate frames. The
frames have the rotation axis at every point.
In the transformation the frequency of one frame
relative to another is not equivalent to the reverse frequency. Using symmetry of the direct and
reverse transformation as well as symmetry of the frame coordinates we show that two diﬀerent type
of the transformation are possible. The ﬁrst type is a generalization of the Lorentz transformation.
This case can not be checked in optical measurements. In contrast to that the second unusual type
allows us to observe consequences of the transformation in an optical experiment even though the
characteristic constant inherent in the transformation is less than “nuclear time” of the order of
10−23 sec. We describe the experiment.

INTRODUCTION

property of the point rotation frames.

The concept of a “point rotation frame” arises in crys-
tallooptics. Distinctive feature of the frame, in contrast
to Cartesian one, is existence of the rotation axis at every
point. In such a frame the axes are constructed on ﬁeld
amplitudes and only the axis direction is essential. Simi-
lar (non-rotating) frames have been used in quantum ﬁeld
theory for a long time. An example of the frame is the
rotating optical indicatrix (index ellipsoid). Once more
diﬀerence in comparison with the Cartesian frame is the
absence of centrifugal forces in the point rotation frame.
The frame coordinates is an angle (phase) and time, the
frequency of rotation is a parameter. In electro-optical
crystals the rotation is stimulated by an applied rotating
electric ﬁeld. In crystals with the linear (Pockels) eﬀect
the frequency equals a half (and even a quarter [1]) of
In the Kerr crystals this fre-
that of the electric ﬁeld.
quency is doubled [2, 3]. The sense of rotation of the
plane circularly polarized light wave moving through the
electro-optical crystal with rotating optical indicatrix is
reversed and the optical frequency is shifted if the am-
plitude of the applied electric ﬁeld equals the half-wave
value. The device for the shift by means of electro-optical
crystals is the single-sideband modulator [4, 5, 6].

It is convenient to use for the description of circularly
polarized plane light wave in the single-sideband modu-
lator the transition to a frame with the resting optical
indicatrix. Apparently, for the ﬁrst time, convenience
of that had been described in initial works on single-
sideband modulation of light [4]. Such a transition results
in change of the optical frequency. The change equals the
frequency of the optical indicatrix. After the polariza-
tion reversal and returning back to the initial frame the
frequency deviation is doubled. Emphasize that in the
frame with the resting indicatrix the modulating electric
ﬁeld is also at rest in spite the fact that both the indi-
catrix and ﬁeld rotate at diﬀerent frequencies relarive to
the initial frame?! This is one more unusual and strange

The transition to the rotating frame always is con-
nected with the question what is the frequency superpo-
sition law, is it linear or not. The nonlinear law always
corresponds to an extra frequency shift. Emphasize that
the consideration in the framework of the Maxwell equa-
tion can not give such an extra shift. The situation is
analogous to a comparison between results obtained for
rectilinear move with help of the Lorentz transformation
and the Newton mechanics.

In Ref.[7] the question was considered in assumption
that the combined frequency may be presented in terms
of power series of two other frequencies. It was also as-
sumed that the frequency of one frame relative to another
equals to the reverse frequency. The only diﬀerence is the
sign. The negative sign corresponds to the rotation in op-
posite direction. In this condition the extra shift in the
ﬁrst approximation is proportional to the product of the
optical frequency squared and the modulation frequency.
The characteristic constant in the extra shift has dimen-
sion of time.
In Ref.[7] a optical experiment was also
proposed for measurement of the term and it was shown
that a lower limit for measurements of the characteristic
constant with such a form of the shift is about 10−17sec.
Shortly after it was shown that an analogy exists be-
tween the light propagation in medium with the rotating
optical indicatrix and the motion particle in the rotating
magnetic ﬁeld and both the phenomena can be described
in the framework of the Pauli equation [8]. In other words
a plane circularly polarized light wave propagating along
the optical axis of 3-fold electro-optical crystal under the
action of an applied electric ﬁeld possesses properties of
two-component spinor. It means that measurements of
the optical frequency shift in the single-sideband mod-
ulator is similar to measurements of the magnetic mo-
ment in the magnetic resonance and anomalous magnetic
moment may be associated with the nonlinear frequency
shift. It was understood that the probable value of the
characteristic constant is, as maximum, of the order of
[8, 9]. Such a small value

term calculated in Ref.[7]

Meanwhile the immediate way to determine the fre-
quency superposition law is the transformation for the
point rotation frames. Emphasize that the Maxwell equa-
tion do not contain any information about the transfor-
mation. The transformation must be postulated.

In the given paper we consider general linear trans-
formation for the point rotation frames. We use sym-
metry of frame coordinates and assume that the reverse
frequency is a function of the direct frequency with the
same function in vice versa. We show that two diﬀerent
types of the transformation exist. The ﬁrst type is a gen-
eralization of the Lorentz transformation. The type in
an experimental sense corresponds to the case of Ref.[7].
The second type is principally diﬀerent. The type give
us a chance to measure the extra term. We describe an
optical experiment for the measurement of the term. The
experiment keeps the main features of that in Ref.[7].

II. GENERAL LINEAR TRANSFORMATION

The general form of the linear transformation for the
transition from one frame to another can be written as
follows

˜ϕ = q(ϕ

νt),

˜t =

where ϕ and t is an angle (phase) and time, tilde corre-
sponds to the reverse transformation

˜ν˜t),

t =

˜ϕ

˜q

˜ν

ν is the frequency of second frame relative to ﬁrst one.
It is obvious that Eq.(1) turns out into Eq.(2) if vari-
ables with tilde change to variables without tilde and
vice versa.

First of all we exclude from the consideration the
Galilean transformation, i.e., the case q
1. This case
with its inﬁnite frequencies seems unbelievable from the
viewpoint of contemporary physics.

etc., we would arrive to the case ν =
˜ν. However we
can not carry out arbitrary normalization since usually
t and ϕ already determined and connected with the
space Cartesian coordinates. Generally the point rota-
tion frames is not compatible with the Cartesian frame
except when the frames are at rest. In this case if the
rotation axis coincides with some Cartesian axis we may
associate ϕ and t with the Cartesian cylindric angle and
time. The above normalization would result, in partic-
ular, in the change of the speed of light. Therefore we

−

must consider here the general case assuming that ˜ν is
a function of ν. It means that rotation to the right and
left is not equivalent in the approach.

For the point rotation frame we have not a general
principle like the relativity principle for the Cartesian
frames, however we use principle of symmetry instead.
It means, in particular, that if ˜ν = f (ν) then ν = f (˜ν).
The function ˜ν(ν) and q(ν) remain indeterminate ex-

0. If the characteristic constant τ is of the order
10−23 sec. then the normalized frequency τ ν even in

microwave range is about 10−12. Therefore we assume
that the function ˜ν(ν) may be expanded in the powers

This expansion is compatible with the reverse expansion,
obtained from (3) by replacing of ˜ν, ν for ν, ˜ν respectively,
at certain conditions for the coeﬃcients an, namely, the
expansion can not contain only odd power of ν and up
to term ν2n has only n independent coeﬃcients an. Ob-
viously that any expansion (3) together with the reverse
expansion can be written in the symmetric form with
help of ﬁnite or inﬁnite series

where F is a function. Results below will be also valid
for arbitrary F (˜νν) with the only condition F (0) = 0.

Since the nonlinear frequency shift is deﬁned by prod-
uct ˜qq we do not need to know the explicit form of func-
tion q(ν). For ﬁnding the form of ˜qq we use symmetry
between ϕ and t. Transformation (1) can be written as

a dimensional constant. Making use of the substitution

the viewpoint of the experimental checking this case is
equivalent to results of Ref.[7].

niteness, are assumed to rotate in the same direction with
frequencies ω and ν. In correspondence with Eq.(1) the

interpreted as the time of the rotation through angle ϕ at
frequency 1/τ. However there is possible another inter-
pretation. Maybe the strange transformation of the point
rotation frame into itself is the mathematical reﬂection
of the fact that time is determined with uncertainty of
ϕτ ?

If the second type truly corresponds to physical reality
then a lower limit for measurements of the characteristic
constant may be drastically decreased.

The extra shift 2τ ω2 do not depend on ν, i.e., such a shift
is produced by the usual half wave plate! Emphasize that
from the viewpoint the Maxwell equation the frequency
shift in the single-sideband modulator is a consequence
of the phase diﬀerence between two component of the
electric ﬁeld of light wave whereas from the viewpoint of
photons it is something diﬀerent. The extra shift may
be interpreted as an energy of the polarization reversal.
The sign diﬀerence of the energy corresponds to the as-
sumption on inequivalence of the right and left rotation.
The shift of the second type may far exceed the shift of
the ﬁrst type. The relative value of the extra shift for

the given case the schematic is simpliﬁed (heterodyne
and doubler are crossed out in Fig.1) since resonance
Ω = 2τ ω2 can be used with matching the sign of τ by
the reversal of the applied electric ﬁeld. The shift can be
measured with conﬁdence even though the characteristic
constant is about 10−25 sec. Note that if the extra shift
really exists then similar schematic may be eﬀectively
used for precision measurements in spectroscopy.

V. CONCLUSION

The idea of inequivalence of the direct and reverse fre-
quencies and the principle symmetry leads to two types
of the transformation for the point rotation frames. The
ﬁrst type is a generalization of the Lorentz transforma-
tion. The type seems more applicable to the Cartesian
frames. Measurements of the extra frequency shift in this
case lies beyond possibilities of optics. The second type
is applicable only to the point rotation frames. The type
possesses unusual and strange properties however it may
be veriﬁed in optical measurements even though the char-
acteristic constant in the transformation less than 10−23
sec.

Another question arises in the above construction: is
parity violation connected with the inequivalence of the
direct and reverse frequency?

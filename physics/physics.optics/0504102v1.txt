Coupling of external light signals into a photonic crystal waveguide becomes increasingly ineﬃcient
as the group velocity of the waveguiding mode slows down. We have systematically studied the
eﬃciency of coupling in the slow light regime for samples with diﬀerent truncations of the photonic
lattice at the coupling interface. The coupling eﬃciency is found to be signiﬁcantly improved up
to group indices of 100 for a truncation of the lattice that favors the appearance of the photonic
surface states at the coupling interface in resonance with the slow light mode

Planar two-dimensional (2D) slab-type photonic crys-
tals (PhC) have attracted much attention recently as
a possible platform for densely integrated photonic cir-
cuits. Engineering of the photonic dispersion utilized in
planar devices might provide unique functionalities for
integrated photonics unattainable with conventional ap-
proaches. For example slowing down the propagation
velocity of light1,2 in PhC waveguides has been proposed
for compact delay lines and all-optical storage devices3.
However coupling of external optical signals to the PhC
structures becomes prohibitively ineﬃcient at frequen-
cies corresponding to the slow light regime. Indeed the
strong modiﬁcation of mode dispersion corresponds to
group indices diﬀering by orders of magnitude from the
nearly dispersionless group index of the mode in a con-
ventional strip waveguide. This results in increasingly
large impedance mismatch between the modes, which is
the origin of strong reﬂectivity of the interface between
the PhC waveguide and strip waveguide (strip/PhC in-
terface). Several recent theoretical studies7,8,9 indicated
that the exact termination of the photonic lattice at
the PhC/strip interface is important for obtaining bet-
ter impedance matching. However the slow light regime
was intentionally omitted from the analysis due to pro-
nounced diﬃculties with numerical techniques in this
regime. At the same time several recent studies indi-
cate that surface states localized at the PhC interface
can play a signiﬁcant role in the coupling process4,5,6.
Spectral position and photonic dispersion of these sur-
face states can be independently tuned by changing the
exact truncation of the photonic lattice4.

In this Letter we study experimentally the dependence
of the coupling eﬃciency at the PhC/strip interface on
the exact termination of the lattice. We explore the possi-
bility of tuning these surface states in resonance with the
slow light waveguiding mode in the 2D PhC waveguide
in order to improve mode matching and obtain eﬃcient
coupling.

To experimentally study the coupling eﬃciency, PhC
structures were fabricated on a silicon-on insulator
200mm wafer with 1µm BOX layer on a standard CMOS
fabrication line as described elsewhere10,11. PhCs with
a triangular lattice of period a=437nm were deﬁned by

etching holes with radius R=109nm through a silicon
layer with thickness d=220nm. PhC waveguides were
formed by omitting one row of holes (W1 waveguide) in
the lattice along the Γ-K direction. In order to probe the
inﬂuence of surface termination, a set of samples were
fabricated in which the truncation of the PhC waveg-
uides at the strip/PhC interface was varied by changing
the termination parameter from τ =0 to τ =1 as shown in
the inset of Fig. 1. The length of the PhC W1 waveguides
L was kept approximately constant with 22 full unit cells
( 10µm). The light from a broadband source (four cou-
pled LEDs with 50nm linewidth each) was coupled to the
photonic chip through a polymer-based ﬁber coupler us-
ing a tapered and micro-lensed PM ﬁbers10,11. High res-
olution spectra were also measured with a tunable diode
laser having 1MHz linewidth. Access strip waveguides
with 460x220nm cross-section are butt-coupled to the
PhC W1 waveguides through a lateral taper10 with the ﬁ-
nal width of 757nm corresponding to √3a. Transmission
spectra from the PhC waveguide circuits were normal-
ized on the transmission spectrum of a strip waveguide
circuit without a PhC. Owing to small side-wall surface
roughness with standard deviation 1.5nm as measured
with AFM the propagation loss in analogous strip waveg-
uides and PhC waveguides has been measured recently as
0.5db/cm at 1650nm10,11, cor-
low as 6

The inset of Fig. 1 presents set of transmission spectra
recorded with optical spectrum analyzer for TE polariza-
tion for broad wavelengths range from 1300 to 1700nm.
As is seen, the spectra for samples with terminations
τ =0, τ =0.5, and τ =0.75 are almost identical for most
of the wavelengths. Spectra exhibit a sharp cutoﬀ at
1670nm corresponding to the onset of the W1 waveg-
uiding mode11. A series of resonances at wavelengths
below 1450nm correspond to the slab modes at the up-
per photonic band edge. According to the photonic band
structure calculated by the planewave expansion method
the light line cutoﬀ of the waveguiding mode should be
around 1550nm. It is not visible in the spectra since the
length of the PhC waveguide is so small. It is seen that at
wavelengths around 1600nm coupling at strip/PhC inter-
face is almost perfect for all the terminations. Coupling

losses here can be estimated to be as small as 0.3
0.1dB,
which includes both coupling in and coupling out of the
strip/PhC interfaces. This excellent coupling is not sur-
prising since the width of the access strip waveguide is
chosen to match closely both the geometrical spread of
the mode in the PhC waveguide and its group index far
from the slow light regime10,11.

At wavelengths longer than approximately 1600nm
closer to the waveguide onset cutoﬀ at 1670nm a notable
diﬀerence in the spectra is observed. This region corre-
sponds to where the wavevectors k approach the Brillouin
zone edge, and is characterized by increasingly slow group
velocity. Figure 1 shows the same set of transmission
spectra for this wavelength range measured with an LED
source with spectral resolution of 60pm. Strong Fabry-
Perot oscillations, especially noticeable for the spectrum
of the sample with τ =0.5, are observed indicating large
reﬂections at the coupling interface. The distance be-
tween minima and maxima ∆λ of the oscillations is de-
creasing from 10nm to below 1nm towards the mode
onset cut-oﬀ reﬂecting the increasingly small group ve-
locity. The spectral positions of the maxima and minima
of the oscillations can be used to extract the spectral de-
pendence of the group index as ng=λ/(4L∆λ). Group
indices approaching 100 are typical for the last visible
maxima around 1667nm. It is also seen that the ampli-
tudes of the maxima Imax and minima Imin are gradually
decreasing toward the cut-oﬀ, while V , the fringe visibil-
ity, is actually increasing toward the cutoﬀ approaching
0.8 for the last fringes around 1667nm. The latter indi-
cates that the fringe amplitude is not seriously aﬀected by

the low coherence of the LED source (50nm line width).
To conﬁrm this same measurements were repeated with
tunable solid state laser (1MHz line width). As it is seen
in the inset of Fig. 2, spectra are identical even at the
wavelength of the last visible oscillation around 1667nm.
In principle a strong decrease in fringe amplitude can
be attributed to increased propagation losses in the slow
light regime. However, even if we assume that losses mea-
sured as 7dB/cm11 increase linearly with the group in-
dex, the propagation losses for 10µm long PhC waveguide
should not exceed 1dB for group indices of 100. Small
propagation losses can also be inferred from the compari-
son of spectra for diﬀerent terminations in Fig. 1. Indeed
the fringe amplitudes in the spectra for diﬀerent termi-
nations diﬀer by almost 10dB (see for example spectra
for τ =0 and τ =0.5), while the length of the PhC waveg-
uide L is identical (note the identical spectral positions of
maxima and minima). If transmission losses in the slow
light regime were the dominant loss source we would ex-
pect fringe amplitudes measured at the same wavelength
to be identical for diﬀerent terminations, the opposite of
what we observe experimentally.

The evident diﬀerence in the amplitude of the max-
ima for samples with diﬀerent termination indicates that
the main source of this damping is increasingly ineﬃ-

cient coupling at the PhC/strip interface. If we assume
that the propagation losses inside the PhC are negligible
the amplitude of maxima corresponds to the combined
coupling losses at the input and output PhC/strip in-
terfaces. Figure 2a presents the dependence of the cou-
pling losses on the group index for waveguides with dif-
ferent termination. The reﬂectivity R of the PhC/strip
interface can also be extracted from the fringe visibility
V =(Imax-Imin)/(Imax+Imin) assuming that the reﬂec-
tivities of the input and output interfaces are equal. The
dependence of the interface reﬂectivity R on the group
index is shown in Fig. 2b. Three diﬀerent samples were
measured for each termination. Although visible even in
Fig. 1 the diﬀerences between diﬀerent terminations be-
come evident analyzing Fig. 2a. It is clear that there is a
strong dependence of coupling eﬃciency on the termina-
tion and the best coupling is provided by the termination
τ =0.75. Surprisingly there is no noticeable dependence
of interface reﬂectivity on termination as seen in Fig. 2b.
To the best of our knowledge these are the ﬁrst exper-
imental measurements of both coupling and reﬂectivity
of the PhC interface in the slow light regime.

Several recent publications examined theoretically the
coupling eﬃciency of the strip/PhC interface for diﬀer-

3

ent terminations of the lattice7,8,9. Although the slow
light regime was intentionally omitted from considera-
tion, for frequencies far from the mode cut-oﬀ that termi-
nations around τ =0 are preferred over τ =0.5. It has been
argued8 that this is a result of better impedance matching
due to the spatial periodicity of the PhC impedance at
the termination. Indeed our experimental results clearly
show that τ =0 termination has far superior coupling
than τ =0.5 even for group indices as high as 100. How-
ever the best performance is experimentally observed for
τ =0.75. To better understand this result the photonic
band structures of a PhC W1 waveguide (Fig. 3a) and
the truncated PhC slab (see Fig. 3b) were calculated
with the 3D planewave expansion method12. It is seen
from Fig. 3 that the surface states appear in the pho-
tonic gap with dispersion (Fig. 3b) and spectral position
(Fig. 3c) depending strongly on the termination param-
eter. The truncations τ =0, 0.5 and τ =1 correspond to
surface states tuned out of the photonic gap. Surface
states do not contribute to propagation at the strip/PhC
interface and these terminations are equivalent in this re-
spect. Terminations around τ =0.3 and τ =0.8, however
are characterized by surface states tuned almost in reso-
nance with the PhC waveguide slow light mode. More-
over the surface state dispersion is almost ﬂat at these
frequencies reﬂecting the strong localization of the sur-
face mode within only the ﬁrst period from the interface.
Correspondingly not only is the impedance at the PhC
termination strongly modiﬁed by the presence of surface
states, but the group indices of the PhC slow light mode
and surface states are also nearly matched. Based on
these observations we can argue that experimentally mea-
sured performance indicate that surface states do play a
signiﬁcant role in coupling. Moreover even better cou-
pling eﬃciency can be envisioned for termination around
τ =0.8 which tunes the surface states exactly in resonance
with the slowlight mode.

In conclusion we have experimentally measured cou-
pling eﬃciency and reﬂectivity at the strip/PhC inter-
face in the slow light regime. Strong dependence of the
coupling eﬃciency on the exact termination of the PhC
lattice at the interface was found. Experimental results
and theoretical calculations allow to suggest that termi-
nations with photonic surface states tuned in resonance
with the PhC slow light mode provide the best coupling
eﬃciency. This ﬁnding can shed light on many other
coupling phenomena in PhC like, for example, recently
discovered beaming and focusing of light exiting the 2D
PhC waveguide structure5,6.

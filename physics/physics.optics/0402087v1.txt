We analyze transmission of electromagnetic waves through a periodic band-gap structure consist-
ing of slabs of a left-handed metamaterial and air. Using the eﬀective parameters of the metamaterial
derived from its microscopic structure, we study, with the help of the transfer-matrix approach and
by means of the ﬁnite-diﬀerence-time-domain numerical simulations, the transmission properties of
such a left-handed photonic crystals in a novel type of band gap associated with the zero averaged
refractive index. We demonstrate that the transmission can be made tunable by introducing defects,
which allow to access selectively two diﬀerent types of band gaps.

INTRODUCTION

Materials with both negative dielectric permittivity
and negative magnetic permeability were suggested the-
oretically a long time ago [1], and they are termed left-
handed materials because the wave vector and Poynt-
ing vector lie in the opposite directions. Many unusual
properties of such materials can be associated with their
negative refractive index, as was demonstrated by several
reliable experiments [2, 3] and numerical ﬁnite-diﬀerence-
time-domain (FDTD) simulations (see, e.g., Ref. [4]).

Multilayered structures that include materials with
negative refraction can be considered as a sequence of
the ﬂat lenses that provide an optical cancellation of
the layers with positive refractive index leading to ei-
ther enhanced or suppressed transmission [5, 6, 7]. More
importantly, a one-dimensional stack of layers with al-
ternating positive and negative-refraction materials with
zero averaged refractive index displays a novel type of
the transmission band gap [6, 8, 9, 10, 11] near the fre-
quency where the condition <n> = 0 is satisﬁed; such
a novel band gap is quite diﬀerent from a conventional
Bragg reﬂection gap because it appears due to completely

periodic structures with zero averaged refractive index
demonstrate a number of unique properties of the beam
transmission observed as strong beam modiﬁcation and
reshaping [8] being also insensitive to disorder that is
symmetric in the random variable [9].

In this paper, we study both transmission properties
and defect-induced tunability of the left-handed photonic
band gap structures created by alternating slabs of posi-
tive and negative refractive index materials with an em-
bedded defect taking into account realistic parameters,
dispersion and losses of the left-handed material. We con-
sider a band-gap structure schematically shown in Fig. 1.
First, we study the properties of the left-handed mate-
rial as a composite structure made of arrays of wires and
split-ring resonators (see the insert in Fig. 1) and de-
rive the general results for the eﬀective dielectric per-

mittivity and magnetic permeability. Second, we study
the transmission of electromagnetic waves through the
layered structure consisting of alternating slabs of com-
posite left-handed metamaterial using the calculated ef-
fective parameters. We assume that the structure in-
cludes a defect layer (see Fig. 1) that allows tunability
of the transmission near the defect frequency. Using the
transfer-matrix method, we describe the defect-induced
localized states in such a structure and reveal that the de-
fect modes may appear in diﬀerent parameter regions and
for both <n> = 0 and Bragg scattering band gaps. De-
pending on the defect parameters, the maximum trans-
mission can be observed in all or just some spectral band
gaps of the structure. We demonstrate that the frequency
of the defect mode is less sensitive to manufacturing dis-
order for the larger defect layer. Finally, we perform
two-dimensional FDTD numerical simulations based on
the microscopic parameters of the left-handed material
and study the temporal evolution of the transmitted and
reﬂected ﬁelds.

II. METAMATERIAL CHARACTERISTICS

We assume that the left-handed metamaterial is cre-
ated by a three-dimensional lattice of wires and split-
ring resonators (SRRs), as shown in the inset of Fig. 1.
According to the results of the derivation presented in
Refs. [12, 13], the main contribution to the eﬀective di-
electric permittivity of this structure is given by the
wires, whereas the magnetic response is determined by
SRRs. Although a three-dimensional lattice of wires
contains closed circuits, we neglect their contribution to
the magnetic permeability, because this eﬀect is non-
resonant, and, therefore, is weak. The eﬀective dielectric
permittivity can be obtained in the form [12, 13]

where nm = 3/d3 is the number of SRRs per unit cell,
Rr is the SRR radius (see the insert in Fig. 1), Ir is the
current in the SRR. We assume that SRR is an eﬀec-
tive oscillatory circuit with inductance L and resistance
R of the wire, and capacity C of the SRR slot. In this
circuit the electromotive force in this circuit due to an
alternating magnetic ﬁeld of the propagating wave. Un-

negative ǫ and µ is between 5.82 GHz and 5.96 GHz.
The imaginary part of the magnetic permeability, which
determines eﬀective losses in a left-handed material, is
larger near the resonance.

III. TRANSMISSION AND DEFECT MODES

We consider now a band gap structure created by seven
alternating left-handed and dielectric slab pairs, as shown
in Fig. 1. The number of slabs is chosen to keep losses in
the structure at a reasonably low level, still having visible
the eﬀects of periodicity. We assume that the periodic
structure is created by slabs of the width a, made of the
left-handed composite described above, and separated by
air (ǫa = 1, µa = 1). The middle layer of the left-handed
material is assumed to have a diﬀerent thickness, b =
a(1 + ∆), in order to describe a structural defect.

To study the transmission characteristics of such
a band-gap structure, we consider a normal-incidence
plane wave for the scalar electric ﬁeld described by the

Before analyzing the transmission properties of a ﬁnite
layered structure, ﬁrst we study the corresponding inﬁ-
nite structure without defects and calculate its band gap
spectrum.
In an inﬁnite periodic structure, propagat-
ing waves in the form of the Floquet-Bloch modes satisfy
the periodicity condition, E(z + 2a) = E(z) exp(2i a Kb),
where Kb is the Bloch wavenumber. The values of Kb are
found as solutions of the standard eigenvalue equation for
a two-layered periodic structure (see, e.g., Ref. [11]),

ǫ/µ, kr = ω/c and kl = ω/c√ǫµ are
where pr = 1, pl =
the wavevectors in air and left-handed slabs, respectively.
For real values of Kb, the Bloch waves are propagating;
complex values of Kb indicate the presence of band gaps,
where the wave propagation is suppressed. The spectral
gaps appear when the argument of the cosine function
in Eq. (7) becomes the whole multiple of π, and no real
solutions for Kb exist. These gaps are usually termed
as Bragg gaps. The presence of the left-handed material
in the structure makes it possible for the argument to
vanish, so that the wave propagation becomes prohibited
in this case as well, thus creating an additional band gap,
which do not exist in conventional periodic structures. As
a matter of fact, the condition
corresponds to
the zero average refractive index, <n> = 0, as discussed
in Refs. [6, 8, 9, 10, 11]. However, the inherent feature
of the left-handed materials is their frequency dispersion,
so that the condition

frequency ω∗ at which the indices of refraction in both
the media compensate each other. In a sharp contrast
to the conventional Bragg reﬂection gaps, the position of
this additional <n> = 0 gap in the frequency domain
does not depend on the optical period of the structure.
For the parameters of the left-handed media described
above, the frequency ω∗ at which the average refractive

index vanishes is found as ω∗
Importantly, the transmission coeﬃcient calculated at
ω = ω∗ for the seven-layer structure shows a characteris-
tic resonant dependence as a function of the normalized
slab thickness a/λ, where λ = 2πc/ω∗, as shown in Fig. 3.
The transmission maxima appear in the <n> = 0 gap,
when the slab thickness a coincides with a whole multiple
of a half of the wavelength. The width of the transmission
peaks decreases with the increase of the number of lay-
ers in the structure. The transmission maxima decrease
with increasing thickness of the structure due to losses in
the left-handed material which become larger for thicker
slabs. One of the interesting features of the <n> = 0

electromagnetic waves.

important features: (i) the defect modes do not always
appear simultaneously in all gaps, and (ii) the slope of the
curves in Fig. 5 decreases with the growth of the defect
thickness. As a result, the eigenfrequencies of the modes
introduced by thicker defect layers can be more stable
to disorder introduced by manufacturing. These novel
features seem to be important for tunable properties of
the layered structures because the diﬀerent modes allow
to access diﬀerent types of band gaps.

IV. NUMERICAL FDTD SIMULATIONS

In order to analyze the temporal evolution of the trans-
mitted ﬁelds and the beam scattering under realistic con-
ditions, we perform two-dimensional FDTD numerical
simulations of the beam propagation through the left-
handed periodic structure of seven layers with a defect.
We consider TM-polarized Gaussian beam of the width
20λ propagating towards the structure with the period
a = 0.25λ; such a structure corresponds to the trans-
mission coeﬃcient shown in Fig. 4(a) by a dashed line.
First, we choose the frequency of the incident ﬁeld in
the <n> = 0 gap. The temporal evolution of the en-
ergy ﬂows (integrated over the transverse dimension) for
the incident, transmitted, and reﬂected waves is shown
in Fig. 6(a), clearly indicating that the transmission
through such a structure is negligible. When the fre-
quency of the incident ﬁeld coincides with that of the de-
fect mode, a signiﬁcant amount of the energy is transmit-
ted through the structure [see Fig. 6(b)]. The relaxation
time of the beam transmission through the structure is
estimated as 103 periods (approximately 170 ns).

Results of FDTD simulations for the pulse scattering
from the structure with a = 0.25λ are shown in Figs. 7
(a,b) as the temporal dependence of the incident, re-
ﬂected and transmitted energy ﬂows. One can clearly
see signiﬁcant transmission, when the carrier frequency
of the pulse coincides with the eigen frequency of the
defect mode [see Figs. 7 (a,b)].

FIG. 6: Numerical FDTD simulation results showing relax-
ation processes in a band-gap structure with a defect. Solid –
incident energy ﬂow, dashed – transmitted energy ﬂow, dotted
– reﬂected energy ﬂow. Parameters are: a = 0.25λ, ∆ = −0.8.

slabs [see Fig. 4(a)], the only visible band gap is the
<n> = 0 gap centered near ω∗ where both ǫ and µ are
negative. When the structure has a defect, the trans-
mission peak associated with the excitation of the de-
fect mode appears inside the <n> = 0 gap as shown by
the dashed curve. For the structure with thicker slabs,
for a = 1.25λ [see Fig. 4(b)] the <n> = 0 gap
e.g.
becomes narrower but it remains centered near the fre-
quency ω∗. The transmission coeﬃcient of this second
band-gap structure shows, in addition to the <n> = 0
gap, two Bragg scattering gaps. Due to the increased
losses in this second band-gap structure, where slabs are
thicker than in the structure corresponding to Fig. 4(a),
the eﬀects of the resonant transmission at the defect
mode become less visible. Moreover, for the parameters
we consider here the defect mode appears only in the
<n> = 0 gap, whereas it does not appear in the Bragg
gaps. For larger slab thickness, higher-order Bragg gaps
may appear in the frequency range where the composite
material is left-handed.

In Fig. 5, we show the frequency spectrum of the defect
modes for the structure with a = 1.25λ as a function of
the normalized defect size ∆. We notice a number of

corresponds to low transmission in Fig. 4(a), when no
defect mode is excited. Figure 8(b) demonstrates the
ﬁeld distribution in the structure with an excited defect
mode and enhanced transmission.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the transmission properties of peri-
odic structures made of a left-handed metamaterial and
air. Using realistic parameters of the metamaterial de-
rived from the microscopic approach, we have calculated
the band-gap spectrum of an inﬁnite one-dimensional
structure with and without defects, demonstrating the
existence of band gaps of two diﬀerent types, the conven-
tional Bragg scattering gaps and a novel <n> = 0 gap.
We have analyzed the properties of the defect modes in
a ﬁnite periodic structure with a structural defect and
demonstrated that, depending on the defect size, the de-
fect modes appear in all or just some of the band gaps al-
lowing to access diﬀerent gaps selectively. In addition, we
have performed two-dimensional numerical FDTD simu-
lations of the propagation of electromagnetic waves in
such structures and have studied the temporal dynamics
of the beam transmission and reﬂection. We have demon-
strated that the excitation of defect modes can enhance
substantially the wave transmission through the struc-
ture.

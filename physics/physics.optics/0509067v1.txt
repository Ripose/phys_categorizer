Abstract. We analyze the performance of a planar lens based on realistic negative
index material in a generalized geometry. We demonstrate that the conventional su-
perlens design (where the lens is centered between the object and the image) is not
optimal from the resolution point-of-view, develop an analytical expression for the
resolution limit of a generalized lens, use it to ﬁnd the optimum lens conﬁguration,
and calculate the maximum absorption practical nearﬁeld superlenses may have. We
demonstrate that in contrast to the conventional superlens picture, planar imaging is
typically accompanied by excitation of surface waves at both interfaces of the lens.

Research on the properties of negative refractive index materials (NIMs) [1] is
among the most rapidly developing topics in modern science that may potentially
lead to a number of unique applications including high-performance imaging and
lithographic systems, new types of radars, and transmission lines [2–7]. One of the
most promising applications of NIMs involves the use of a planar slab of negative
refraction material as an optically-perfect imaging instrument [2], known as a su-
perlens. The physics behind the operation of a superlens and the laws governing
the resolution limits of this unique system have instigated considerable contro-
versy [2,8–10]. The recent analytical [11–15], numerical [16,17], and experimen-
tal [6,16,17] results demonstrate that while a NIM-based system may outperform
conventional (phase) lenses, its resolution logarithmically depends on material ab-
sorption, limiting all practical applications of superlens to the near-ﬁeld zone [15].
However, existing analytical results describing the superlens performance, are lim-
ited to a single lens geometry, when a slab of negative-n (or negative-ǫ) material is
centered between an object and its image [2] and the eﬀects of the superlens design
on its resolution are yet to be understood.

Addressing this fundamental question is the primary goal of the present Letter.
In contrast to previous analytical work [12,15,16], here we consider a “generalized”

contrast to diﬀraction theory presented in Ref. [18], here we are primarily interested

We derive an analytical result for resolution of a generalized planar lens, and
demonstrate that the resolution is maximized when a = b (the conﬁguration re-
cently implemented in Ref. [6]). We demonstrate that the superlens becomes im-
practical when ǫ′′ & 0.3. Further, we analyze the ﬁeld distribution in the system
and similar to what in the quasistatic limit was proved analytically [19] and indi-
cated by other near ﬁeld investigations [12,16], discover a new regime when the EM
ﬁeld has its maxima at both interfaces of NIM. We show that in contrast to most
NIM-imaging descriptions [2,11,13–15], the ﬁeld structure in generic imaging sys-
tem is strongly inﬂuenced by this new regime, while the conventional “superlens”
picture (with intensity minimum at the front interface) is rarely realized. Finally,
we conclude that the optimal lens conﬁguration suggested in this Letter minimizes
the ﬁeld intensity inside the lens and correspondingly, the total absorption in the
imaging system.

To better illustrate the underlying physics and simplify the analytical results
presented in this Letter, we restrict ourselves to the case of imaging of a parallel
slot of a thickness d
λ (with λ being the free-space wavelength), extended in
the y direction at the origin of a Cartesian system, emitting radiation with TM
polarization (Fig. 1). The straightforward generalization of results presented here
to the case of diﬀerent shapes of object, lenses, and polarizations will be presented
elsewhere [20].

The planar-lens imaging can be clearly illustrated in the wavevector space
[11,13,15]. In this approach, the monochromatic radiation emitted by the source is
represented as a series of waves with the same frequency ω but diﬀerent wavevec-
tors k =
. The EM ﬁeld at an arbitrary point in the system can be
calculated as a series of individual waves propagated to this point. Therefore, the
problem of imaging an arbitrary source can be reduced to the problem of ﬁnding
the transfer function τ (x, z; kx, ω), of an individual wave with ﬁxed (kx, ω) from
the source (origin) to the given point in the system (x, z). For TM polarization

According to the properties of Fourier series [21], the component with wavevector
kx carries the information about the x-structure of a source with a typical scale of
2π/kx. Therefore, the information about the ﬁne structure of the object is being
ω/c. Since kx and kz in a plane wave are connected
carried in the waves with
z = ω2/c2, these spectral components, also
x + k2
through the dispersion relation k2
known as evanescent waves, have imaginary kz and exponentially decay away from
the source. The suppression of the evanescent spectrum is in fact the mechanism
behind the resolution limit of an imaging system.

Thus, the performance limit of a NIM-based planar lens can be related to its
transfer function τ for the evanescent part of the spectrum (

We then represent the ﬁeld (of a component with some ﬁxed values of kx, ω) inside
the ﬁrst region as a sum of incident and reﬂected waves, the ﬁeld inside the second
region as a sum of transmitted and reﬂected waves, and the ﬁeld in the third region
as a transmitted wave, and use the boundary conditions to ﬁnd all coeﬃcients of
transmission and reﬂection. Using this ﬁeld-matching technique, described in detail
in Ref. [15], in the limit of small absorption ǫ′′

The excellent agreement between the Eqs. (2,3) and the exact solutions of Maxwell
equations is shown in Fig. 2.

We now derive the resolution limit ∆ of the generalized planar lens. Using the
properties of Fourier analysis, the spatial size of a wavepacket at the focal point
(x = 0, z = 2b) (see Fig. 1) can be related to its spectral width δ through the

For the case of symmetric planar lens (b = 2a) Eqs. (6,7) are identical to the ones
previously derived in Refs. [11,12,15,16]. We also note that Eq. (7) describes the
resolution of a near-ﬁeld “poor-man” superlens, formed by a planar slab of material
with ǫ =

1 + iǫ′′, µ = 1 [2,6].

One of the main points of this manuscript is to show that the resolution of a
planar lens is determined not by the focal distance of the lens a, but rather by its
thickness b, which should be minimized in order to optimize the system resolution
(note that the imaging is possible only when b
a). Thus, for the practical
case when the minimum separation between the object and the imaging system
a is ﬁxed (for example due to existence of some protective layer, etc.), the best
possible conﬁguration corresponds to a = b (see Fig. 1b). Note that this particular
conﬁguration solves another problem often associated with the superlens - the local
intensity has its maximum exactly at the focal point (as opposed to the symmetric
lens conﬁguration, when the intensity maximum at the back interface of NIM region
is separated from the focus [2]), making it relatively easy to bring the optical system
“in focus”.

As clearly seen from this last relation, the practical applications of optical sub-
diﬀraction imaging and lithography is limited to non-resonant Ag-based systems,
while more absorbing Au-, or Al- based structures, or resonant systems [23,24] will
have a resolution below the one achievable via conventional near-ﬁeld imaging or
almost-contact (a-separated) lithography.

Finally, we analyze the intensity pattern and absorption in a planar lens. The
ﬁeld inside the lens region (a < z
a + b) is given by Eqs. (1,2). The intensity
pattern at the back interface of the lens reﬂects a well-known eﬀect of evanescent
spectrum restoration [2,15]: either constant, or growing exponential (depending on

In contrast to a widely accepted point of view [2,11], but in agreement with
results in the quasistatic regime [19], the ﬁeld at the front interface (z = a), may not
have a sharp (exponential) minimum even for the case of sub-diﬀraction imaging.
Indeed, as it is clearly seen from Eq. (2), there exists some critical wavevector

yielding 1/√2ǫ′′ for symmetric lens conﬁguration (b = 2a), and 1/2 for the optimal
planar lens b = a described above. Absence of the additional strong ﬁeld maximum
and correspondingly, of the additional absorption associated with such a maximum
further illustrates optimality of the design presented here.

The relation of this phenomenon, which can be attributed to the excitation of
coupled surface waves at both sides of a lens (as opposed to an excitation of a
surface wave-“anti surface wave” pair [15]) to break-up of super-imaging and the
onset of the diﬀraction limit in the system will be described in detail in our future
work [20].

In conclusion, we have developed an analytical approach to the resolution of the
generalized planar lens, used this approach to ﬁnd the optimal (from the resolution
standpoint) conﬁguration of the lens system, and derived the maximum acceptable
loss in the “lens” material in order to achieve a resolution gain over conventional
near-ﬁeld techniques. We also developed an analytical technique to ﬁnd the ﬁeld
distribution throughout the planar imaging system, and demonstrated that there
exists an area of resonant ﬁeld excitation at the front interface of a lens due to the
emergence of a coupled surface wave mode.

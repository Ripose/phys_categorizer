The limits of applicability of the Lang-Kobayashi (LK) model for a semiconductor laser with op-
tical feedback are analyzed. The model equations, equipped with realistic values of the parameters,
are investigated below solitary laser threshold where Low Frequency Fluctuations (LFF) are usually
observed. The numerical ﬁndings are compared with experimental data obtained for the selected
polarization mode from a Vertical Cavity Surface Laser (VCSEL) subject to polarization selective
external feedback. The comparison reveals the bounds within which the dynamics of the LK can be
considered as realistic. In particular, it clearly demonstrates that the deterministic LK, for realistic
values of the linewidth enhancement factor α, reproduces the LFF only as a transient dynamics
towards one of the stationary modes with maximal gain. A reasonable reproduction of real data
from VCSEL can be obtained only by considering noisy LK or alternatively deterministic LK for
extremely high α-values.

INTRODUCTION

The dynamics of semiconductor lasers with optical feedback is studied both experimentally and theoretically since
almost 30 years ([1], for a review see e.g. [2] ). The interest for such conﬁguration, commonly encountered in many
applications (e.g, communication in optical ﬁbers, optical data storage, sensing etc) arises from the rich phenomenology
observed, ranging from multistability, bursting, intermittency, irregular and rare drops of the intensity (low frequency
ﬂuctuations (LFF)) and transition to developed chaos (coherence collapse (CC)). A complete understanding of the
physical mechanisms at the basis of such complex behavior is, however, still lacking. In particular, the origin of the
LFF regime is under debate since the very ﬁrst observations and yet this puzzling problem has not been solved. Their
origin was ascribed to stochastic eﬀects [3, 4] or to deterministic but chaotic dynamics [5], and more recently even to
the interplay between regular periodic and quasi-periodic solutions [6]. The LFF dynamics has been investigated by
using several type of emitters, mainly edge-emitting: ranging from longitudinal multimode [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] to
single-mode DFB [14] semiconductor lasers.

between LFF with the pump current) to Hurst exponents for the laser phase dynamics [20].

From the experimental point of view, a complete characterization of the LFF dynamics is quite diﬃcult, because
of the very diﬀerent time-scales involved [15]. Indeed, fast oscillations on the 10-ps range have been observed with
streak camera measurements [16, 17], representing the fundamental scale on which the system evolves. On the other
hand, the duration of such fast pulsing regime between LFF events can be as long as hundreds of nanoseconds or even
microseconds. In literature, the LFF dynamics has been experimentally characterized in several manners, starting
from a relatively simple statistical analysis of the time separation T between LFF[14, 18, 19] (relating the average

A widely used theoretical description of the system is the Lang-Kobayashi model [21], introduced in 1980 in the eﬀort
to provide a simpliﬁed but eﬀective analysis of an edge-emitting semiconductor laser optically coupled with a distant
reﬂector. In the model, both the multiple reﬂections from the mirror (low coupling) and the possible multimodal
structure of the laser were neglected. The opportunity to include such eﬀects has been discussed in several papers
[7, 8, 9, 12, 22, 23], but the model still remains presented as the standard theoretical approach to the system. While
most of the phenomenology observed in the diﬀerent experiments is grab by the model, quite often a more precise
or quantitative comparison is obtained at the expense of a choice of parameters far from those actually measured or
even not physically plausible.

Recently, a new conﬁguration has been proposed and studied, based on a Vertical Cavity Surface Laser (VCSEL)
with a polarized optical feedback [15]. Such a laser is longitudinal single-mode (due to the very short cavity) but
may support diﬀerent, high order transverse modes for strong enough pumping current (see e.g.[24]). The simmetry
of the cavity allows also for the possible laser action on two diﬀerent, linear polarizations selected by the crystal
axis. The dynamics of the VCSEL with isotropical optical feedback has been examined experimentally in [23, 25] and
theoretically in [26], while the role played by polarized optical feedback has been discussed in [27, 28, 29]. In particular,

2

the setup used in [15] employed a polarizer in the feedback arm, in order to couple back only the radiation of one
polarizations; moreover, a suitable range of pump current was chosen, to assure single transverse mode behavior. In
such conﬁguration, the appearance of LFF was reported and characterized. The possibility to control the role of the
laser modes in the dynamics in this setup allows for a consistent description via the LK model and therefore for an
eﬀective test of its predictions, at variance with similar setup where instead the polarization selection were not used
[23, 25].

Our aim in the present paper is to clarify the origin of the LFF dynamics by comparing numerical results obtained by
solving the LK equations with experimental measurements done on a VCSEL. In particular, the parameters employed
for the integration of the LK rate equations have been carefully derived from the analysis of the same VCSEL employed
for the experiments [32].

In Sec. II we describe our experimental setup, reporting the main phenomenology observed in the range of variation
of the more relevant parameters of the system, namely, the pump current and the phase of feedback. The LK model
is introduced and commented in Sec. III, together with the numerical methods employed for its integration and the
choice of the parameter values derived from the experiment. In Sec. IV the properties of the stationary solutions
are discussed, while in Sec. V a careful characterization of the deterministic model is given, detailing the transient
phenomena and the Lyapunov analysis. In Sec. VI the eﬀect of noise is introduced and analyzed, discussing also
its possible importance in the experiment. A detailed comparison of the numerical results with the experimental
measurements is given in Sec. VII, with particular regard to the distribution of the intensity and of the inter-event
times for diﬀerent parameter choice, including the alpha-factor and the acquisition bandwidths. Finally, we draw our
conclusions in Sec. VIII.

The experimental measurements are performed using a VCSEL semiconductor laser with moderate polarized optical
2.76 mA,
feedback. In particular, our analysis is limited to a regime of pumping below the solitary threshold Ith ∼
where the VCSEL emits light on a single linearly polarized transverse mode. Longitudinal modes are not allowed by
the cavity, and other transverse modes are not present up to currents
6.5 mA. The solitary laser emission remains
well polarized up to roughly the same current (see Fig. 1 (b)).

∼

The technical details of the source are the following. The laser is an air-post VCSEL made by CSEM [30], operating
around 770 nm. The mesa diameter is 9.4 µm, a ring contact deﬁnes the ouput window with a diameter of 5 µm, and
the active medium is composed of three 8 nm quantum wells. The temperature of the laser case is stabilized within
1 mK, the pump current is controlled by a home made battery operated power supply whose current noise is below
40 pA/Hz−1/2 in the frequency range from 1kHz to 3 MHz.

The feedback is applied on the polarization direction of the solitary laser emission. The external cavity includes
collimation optics, two polarizers, a variable attenuator, and the feedback mirrors that is mounted on a piezoelectric

3

transducer at about 50 cm from the laser. The output radiation, after optical isolators, is detected by an avalanche
photodiode with a bandwidth of about 2 GHz, whose signal, sometimes after low-pass ﬁltering, is recorded by a 4 GHz
bandwidth digital scope. More details on the experiment can be found in Refs [15, 31].

Optical feedback results in a reduced threshold I red

2.42 mA, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). We have examined the
dynamic behavior of the output intensity for various pump currents, both above and below Ith, with a particular
attention to possible eﬀects of the feedback phase ∆φ which is varied by acting on the external mirror piezoelectric
transducer.

th ∼

As shown in Fig. 2, we can identify several regimes: (I) at I < Ith one observes a single mode LFF dynamics (i.e. the
main polarization exhibits LFFs, while the secondary polarization remains oﬀ, see Fig. 1 (b)); (II) Ith < I < 3.5 mA:
in this regime the LFF dynamics of the main polarization is accompanied by a synchronized spiking behavior in
the secondary polarization (coupled modes LFF). This regime was analyzed in Ref. [15] and, in more details, in
Ref. [31], where it is proposed that the dynamics of the secondary polarization is driven by the main polarization,
whose behavior is not inﬂuenced by the orthogonal polarization mode. For larger pump current one begins to observe
Coherence Collapse (regime (III) in Fig. 2) and moreover the feedback phase begins to play a fundamental role. In
particular, for increasing I in larger and larger portion of the phase interval the laser is stationary (regime (IV) in
Fig. 2). This phenomenon is not yet understood and it will be subject of a future analysis [27].

Anyway, in the present paper we will limit our analysis to regime (I) (i.e. for I < Ith), where the VCSEL has a
single-mode LFF dynamics and the phase delay of the feedback does not play any role. We remark that this statement
is suggested by the experiment, where the phase stability would be enough to discriminate such eﬀects, as shown in
the analysis of regimes (III-IV).

III. NUMERICAL MODEL AND METHODS

The dynamics of the VCSEL for I < Ith is a purely single mode dynamics and therefore we expect that it could
be reproduced by employing the Lang-Kobayashi (LK) [21] rate equations for the complex ﬁeld E(t) and the carrier
density n(t). In order to achieve an accurate and reliable comparison of the numerical results with the experimental

4

ones we will employ for our simulations the laser working parameters reported in Table I. These parameters have been
determined via a series of suitable experiments for exactly the same VCSEL employed to obtain the measurements
examine in this paper [32]. The only lacking parameter that was not possible to obtain in the previous characterization
is the feedback strength, which is however determined from the threshold reduction.

In this article we use the rate equations derived in Ref. [32] for the single-mode solitary laser, modiﬁed to include
the feedback. Deﬁning the deviation ∆n of the carrier density from transparency normalized to have unitary value
at threshold, i.e.

the following form is obtained [32]:

multiplicative noise term proportional to the square of the reduced carrier density n/nth (nth being the threshold
carrier density) and to the variance of the spontaneous emission noise Rsp. The parameter µ = I/Ith is the pump

these quantities in terms of the laser parameters and for the approximations employed to derive (2) see Ref. [32]).

The dynamical properties of the system can be estimated in terms of the associated Lyapunov spectrum, that fully
characterizes the linear instabilities of inﬁnitesimal perturbations of the reference system. By following the approach
reported in [33], we have estimated the Lyapunov spectrum
(k = 1, . . . , 2N + 1) by integrating the linearized
dynamics associated to eqs (4) in the tangent space and by performing periodic Gram-Schmidt ortho-normalizations
according to the method reported in [35]. The Lyapunov eigenvalues λk are real numbers ordered from the the largest
to the smallest, a positive maximal Lyapunov λ1 is a indication that the dynamics of the system is chaotic. Moreover,

IV. STATIONARY SOLUTIONS

A ﬁrst characterization of the phase space of the LK system can be achieved by individuating the corresponding
stationary solutions and by analyzing their stability properties. The stationary solutions of the above set of equations
can be found by setting ˙ρ = ∆ ˙n = 0 and ˙ψ = Ω, i.e. by looking for solutions of the form

ES(t) = ρSeiΩt

and

∆n(t) = ∆nS

The stationary solutions can be parametrized in terms of the variable θ = φ + Ωτ , and by setting J = (p

The stationary solutions are usually termed external cavity modes (ECMs) and correspond to stationary lasing

states, in the limit of long delay they are densely covering the following ellipse:

The stability properties of these solutions can be obtained by estimating the associated Floquet spectrum

Λn}
these eigenvalues are typically complex and their number is inﬁnite, due to the delay term present in the LK equations.
However, the stability properties of the ECMs are determined by the eigenvalues with the largest real part, in particular
by the maximal one ΛM = (Re ΛM , Im ΛM ). These can be easily determined by solving the characteristic equation
obtained by linearizing around a certain ECM:

where Zn = k(1
in terms of Zn and by considering Λn as a parameter. In this case the solutions of the corresponding second order
equation are

and by self-consistently solve the above equation one can ﬁnd all the eigenvalues, that are arrangend in two branches.
However, the spectrum contains also isolated eigenvalues, that can be obtained by solving directly Eq. (11) in terms
of Λn and by considering Zn as a parameter. In this case the equation is a cubic and by solving self-consistely its
expression one ﬁnds (up to) three distinct eigenvalues. While the pseudo-continuos spectrum emerges due to the
presence of the delay in the system, the isolated eigenvalues originate from those characterizing the three dimensional
single laser rate equations in absence of the delay, i.e., the Eq. (3) with τ = 0 [38].

Typically, depending on their linear stability properties ECM are divided into modes and antimodes [39]. Antimodes
are characterized by a positive real eigenvalue and are therefore unstable. For the modes instead the maximal real
eigenvalue is zero and they are unstable whenever the associated spectrum crosses the imaginary axis. Various types
of instabilities can be observed for these delayed systems and they can be classiﬁed for analogy with the spatially
extended systems as for example modulational-type or Turing-type instabilities [37, 38]. Examples of the unstable
branch for the spectra
associated to Turing-type and modulationali-type instabilities are reported in Fig. 3, for
a classiﬁcation of the possible instabilities of equilibria for delay-diﬀerential equations see [38].

As we will report in the following section, by integrating the deterministic version of the model (4) for moderate
α- and µ-values, we always observe a relaxation towards one of the SMs. In particular for 3 < α < 5 the dynamics
seem to relax always towards one of the SMs located in proximity of the MGM (corresponding to θ
0) (see Fig. 4).
It should be noticed that the MGM is a solution of the system only for appropriate choices of φ. Two examples of
typical ECMs are reported in Fig. 4 for the present system for α = 3.2 and 5 and µ = 0.93, in both cases two stable
attracting modes have been identiﬁed. Recently, a similar coexistence of two stable solutions located in proximity of
the MGM has been reported experimentally for an edge-emitter laser with a low level of optical feedback [40]

≡

As reported in [37] the stability properties of the MGM do not depend on α, therefore it is reasonable to expect
that some SM will be always present in a narrow window around θ for any chosen linewidth enhancement factor [39]
and that they will coexist with the chaotic dynamics, as observed experimentally in [41].

V. DETERMINISTIC DYNAMICS

An open problem concerning the deterministic LK equations is if and for which range of parameters these equations
faithfully reproduce the experimentally observed dynamics. Particular interest is usually focused on the α-value to
be employed to obtain a realistic behaviour of the model.

A. LFFs as a transient phenomenon

To answer this question we consider the deterministic verson of the model (4) (i.e. by assuming R

0) equipped
with the parameter values deduced by the experimental data [32] apart for µ and α that will be varied. In particular,
we would like to understand if the system shows a LFF behaviour and if such dynamics is statistically stationary or
not. In order to verify it, we initialize randomly the amplitude ρ(t = 0), the phase φ(t = 0) and the excess carrier
density ∆n(t = 0), then we follow the dynamics and we examine the evolution of the ﬁeld intensity ρ2(t). If the
dynamics end up on a stationary solution we register the time Ts necessary to reach it and we average this time over
many (M ) diﬀerent initial conditions. In order to measure Ts, we estimate the time needed to the standard deviation
of the intensity (evaluated over sub-windows of time duration tw) to decrease below a chosen threshold Γ. The average
times < Ts > are reported in Fig. 5

≡

The main result shown in Fig. 5 is that the system after a transitory phase (shorter or longer) settles down to
a SM and that the duration of the transient increases for increasing α or µ-values. Preliminary indications in this
direction have been previously reported in [14]. These results clearly indicate that the LFF dynamics is just a transient
phenomenon for the deterministic LK equation for commonly employed α-values (i.e., for α
3.5). For each
ﬁxed µ it seems that < Ts > diverge above some ”critical” α-value, however we cannot exclude that the system
will also in this case ﬁnally converge to a SM. At least we can consider the reported critical values as lower bounds
above which LFF could occur as a stationary phenomenon and not as a transitory state. With the chosen numerical
1 s
accuracy and due to the available computational resources, for any pratical purpose a transient longer than 0.1
can be considered as an inﬁnite time.

3.0

∼

−

−

An interesting feature is that the variability of < Ts > with α is quite wild and it reﬂects the stability of the modes
in proximity of the MGM, as shown in Fig. 6. However the average values < Ts > (averaged also over α-intervals of
width 0.1) still indicates a clear trend of the transient times to increase with α.

We expect that the time scale associated to the convergence to a stable mode is ruled by the eigenvalue with the
maximal real part (apart the eigenvalue zero, that is always present due to the phase invariance of the LK equations).
In particular we expect that the intensity of the signal will converge towards the stable mode as

where ΛM is the eigenvalue with maximal (non zero) real part associated to the considered stable solution. For small
µ we have observed that the dynamics can collapse to diﬀerent stable solutions (typically, from 1 to 3). By estimating

where Γ is the employed threshold. As it can be seen in Fig. 6, the estimation is quite good and the periodicity of
the two quantities is identical in the examined range of α-values and for µ = 0.93. The expression (13) always gives
a good estimate of < Ts > for α < 4 and for µ < 1, but the agreement worsens for increasing α-values.

However, even a more rough estimate is capable to give a reasonable approximation of < Ts > and in particular to

capture its periodicity. This estimate is simply given by

From the present analysis it emerges that the stable modes play a relevant role for the (transient) dynamics of the
deterministic LK equations at least for α < 4. Moreover the observed strongly ﬂuctuating behaviour of < Ts > as
a function of α indicates that the choice of this parameter is quite critical, since a small variation can lead to an
increase of an order of magnitude of the transient time[44]

B. Lyapunov Analysis

We have characterized the transient dynamics preceeding the collapse in the stationary state in terms of the
maximal Lyapunov λ1 and of the associated Kaplan-Yorke (or Lyapunov) dimension DKY .
In particular, these
quantities reported in Fig. 7 have been estimated by integrating the linearized dynamics for a suﬃciently long time
period Tint and by averaging over M diﬀerent initial realizations.

It is clear from the ﬁgures that the average maximal Lyapunov exponent < λ1 > is deﬁnetely not zero for all
the considered situations and that it increases (almost steadily) with the parameter α as well as with the pump

by exhibiting large oscillations as a function of α, as shown in the inset of 7(a).

The values of < DKY > reported in 7(b) clearly indicate that the system cannot be described as low dimensional,
even during the transient and even below the solitary laser threshold. As a matter of fact the number of active degrees
of freedom ranges between 10 and 50. It should be noticed that < DKY > is determined by the instability properties
not only of anti-modes and but also of modes that have bifurcated (via Hopf instabilities) becoming unstable for
increasing α.

We have examined the dynamics (2) for increasing level of noise, namely for 10−6 < R < 10−2. Also in this case,
for α = 3.3 and for noise levels smaller than 10−3 the LFF dynamics only occurs during a transient. However for

VI. NOISY DYNAMICS

10

(15)

increasing R values we observed a transition to sustained LFF and the transition region was characterized by an
intermittent behaviour. These behaviours are exempliﬁed in Fig. 8 for α = 3.3 and µ = 0.97. As shown in Fig.
8(a) the orbit spends long times in proximity of one of the SM and then, due to noise ﬂuctuations, escapes from the
attraction basin associated to the stable solution and exhibit LFFs before being newly reattracted by the SM. This
intermittent dynamics can be interpreted as an activated escape process induced by noise ﬂuctuations, and therefore
the average residence time < Tres > in the attraction basin of the SM can be expressed in the following way

< Tres >

exp [W/R]

where W represent a barrier that the orbit should overcome in order to escape from the SM valley. As shown in Fig.
10−4. It

means that for R < W one should expect an intermittent behaviour, while for R > W the dynamics of the orbit will
be essentially diﬀusive, since the noise ﬂuctuations are suﬃcient to drive the orbit always out of the SM valley. These
indications suggest that in order to observe a “non transient” or “non intermittent” LFF dynamics the amount of
noise present in the system should be larger than W . Also in [14] it has been clearly stated that the LK-equations
with parameters tuned to reproduce the dynamics of a DFB laser with α = 3.4 can give rise to stationary LFF only
in presence of noise.

A. Lyapunov Analysis

Also in the noisy case we have examined the degree of chaoticity in the system by estimating the maximal Lyapunov
exponent along noisy orbits of the system. The role of noise is fundamental in destabilizing the dynamics of the system
and in rendering the asymptotic dynamics chaotic.

In particular, as shown in Fig. 10(a) we observe that at µ = 0.93 and k = 0.25 the deterministic dynamics (R = 0)

2.64, 2.70, and 2.75. Since Ith = 2.76 these data correspond to 0.9 < µ < 1.0. The ﬁrst distribution has a large contribution
from the Gaussian electronic noise, which also explains the negative ρ2 values.

A. Distributions of the ﬁeld intensities

As a ﬁrst indicator we have considered the distribution of the ﬁeld intensities P (ρ2), in particular in order to match

the experimental ﬁndings we consider the signal ﬁltered at 200 MHz.

×

The experimental results for the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the ﬁeld intensities ρ2 are reported in
Fig. 11 for various currents below the solitary threshold value. It should be noticed that the amplitudes ρ2 have been
rescaled in order to match the corresponding numerical values for the noisy LK eqs with α = 3.3 and noise variance
R = 3.3

10−3, but that no arbitrarly shift have been applied to the data.

A peculiar characteristic of these data is that for increasing pump current the PDFs become more and more
asymmetric, revealing a peak at large intensities that shifts towards higher and higher ρ2 values and a sort of plateau
at smaller intensities.

The corresponding PDFs are reported in Figs. 12 and 13 for data obtained from the integration of the noisy and
deterministic LK eqs, respectively. A better agreement between numerical and experimental ﬁndings is found for the
4.0 and k = 0.35, with a noise variance similar to the experimental one (namely,

These results indicate that it is necessary to include the noise in the LK eqs to obtain a reasonable agreement with
the experiment, at least at the level of the intensities PDFs. However, the numerical data seem unable to reproduce
the narrow peak present in the experimental ones at large intensities and for µ
1. In the next sub-section a further
comparison will be performed to validate these preliminary indications.

B. Average values of the LFF times

We will ﬁrst compare the experimental and numerical measurements of the average times between two consecutive
drops of the ﬁeld intensities < TLF F >. They have been evaluated in two (consistent) ways: both from a direct
measurement of periods between threshold crossing, and from the Fourier power spectrum of the temporal signal
ρ2(t).

The direct measurements of the TLF F from the time trace of ρ2(t) have been performed by deﬁning two thresholds

both noisy and deterministic LK eqs. In Fig. 14 (b) a new set of experimental data is reported and compared with
simulation results for k = 0.35, in this case all the data have been obtained by the method of the thresholds. From
the ﬁgures it is clear that a reasonably good agreement between experimental and numerical data is observed for the
deterministic case only for α = 5 (results for smaller α-values, obtained during the transient preceeding the stable
phase, are not shown but they exhibits a worst agreement with experimental ﬁndings) and for the noisy dynamics for
α = 4.0.

A more detailed analysis can be obtained by considering not only the average values of the LFF times, but also the
associated standard deviation V . This quantity reported in Fig. 15 exibits a clear decrease with µ by approaching
the solitary treshold, indicating a modiﬁcation of the observed dynamics that tends to be more “regular”. Also in
this case the comparison of experimental and numerical data suggests that the best agreement is again attained with

the noisy dynamics at α = 4.0.

At this stage of the comparison we can sketch some preliminary conclusions: the LK eqs are able to reproduce
reasonably well the experimental data for the VCSEL below the solitary threshold both in the deterministic case and
in the noisy situation. However in the deterministic case a quite large value of the linewidth enhancement factor (with
respect to the experimentally measured one) is required. A more detailed comparison will be possible by considering
the PDFs of the TLF F .

C. Distributions of the LFF times

In this sub-section we will examine the whole distribution of the TLF F in more details. Considering the experimental
data, we observe that all the measured PDFs obtained for diﬀerent pump currents reveal an exponential-like tail at
long times and a rapid drop at short times (as shown in Fig. 16). These results are in agreement with those reported
in [18] for a single-transverse-mode semiconductor laser in proximity of Ith.

The typical dynamics corresponding to a LFF can be summarized as follows: a sudden drop of the intensity is
followed by a steady increase of ρ2, associated to ﬂuctuations of the intensity, until a certain threshold is reached
and the intensity is reset to its initial value and restart with the same “sysiphus cycle” [5]. This behaviour and the
observed shapes of the PDFs suggest that the dynamics of the intensities can be modelized in terms of a Brownian
motion plus drift. In other words, by denoting with x(t) the intensity, an eﬀective equation of the following type can
be written to reproduce its dynamical behaviour:

˙x(t) = η + σξ(t)

with initial condition x(0) = x0, where ξ(t) is a Gaussian noise term with zero average and unitary variance, η repre-
sents the drift, σ is the noise strength. Within this framework the average ﬁrst passage time to reach a ﬁxed threshold

these dependences are indeed quite well veriﬁed for the experimental data above the solitary threshold as shown in

For the simple model introduced by eq. (16), the PDF of the ﬁrst passage times is the so-called Inverse Gaussian

motion subjected to a drift plus a reset mechanism once the intensity has overcome a certain threshold.

A way of rewriting the distribution (18) in a more compact form as a function of only one parameter, the so-called
coeﬃcient of variation δ = V /τ (i.e., the ratio between the standard deviation V and the mean τ ), is to rescale the
time as z = (T

It is clear that all the PDFs will coincide, once rescaled in this way, if the coeﬃcient of variation δ has the same value
for all the considered pump currents. However this is not the case and indeed we measured values of δ in the range
[0.28 : 0.66] for I < Ith, nonetheless if we report in a single graph all these curves the overall matching is very good,
as shown in Fig. 17.

Let us ﬁnally compare these distributions g(z) with the corresponding ones obtained from direct simulations of the
LK eqs.. As one can see from Fig. 18 the agreement is good for the data obtained from the simulation of the noisy
LK eqs at α = 4.0, while it is worse for the deterministic LK eqs at α = 5.0.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

We presented a detailed experimental and numerical study of a semiconductor laser with optical feedback. The
choice of a Vertical Cavity Laser pumped close to its threshold, together with a polarized optical feedback, assures
a great control over the possibility of lasing action of other orders longitudinal and/or transverse modes than the
fundamental one, and of the activation of the other polarization. In such a way, the description of the system using
the Lang-Kobayashi model is well justiﬁed and it allows for a meaningful comparison with the experimental data.
The analysis has been performed with particular regard to the LFF regime, where the model has been numerically
integrated using parameters carefully measured in the laser sample used for the measurements.

The comparison of the the measurements carried out in the VCSEL with polarized optical feedback with the
predictions of the deterministic LK model suggest that in the examined range of parameters the dynamics of the
model is characterized by a chaotic transient leading to stable ECMs with high gain. The transient duration increases
(and possibly diverges) with increasing values of the rescaled pump current µ and of the linewidth enhancement factor
α. We have not found evidence of periodic or quasi-periodic asymptotic attractors, as instead reported in [6], this can
be due to the α-range examined in the present paper (namely 2.4
5.5), since these solutions become relevant
for the dynamics only for α > 5 (as stated in [6]).

However, a stationary LFF dynamics with characteristics similar to those measured experimentally, can be obtained
4) only via the introduction of an additive noise term in the
for realistic values of the α parameter (namely, α
LK equations. The role of noise in determining the statistics and the nature of the dropout events has been previously
examined in [3, 4], but in the present paper we have clariﬁed that the LFF dynamics can be interpreted at a ﬁrst
level of approximation as a biased Brownian motion towards a threshold with a reset mechanism.

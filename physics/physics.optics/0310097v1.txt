The polarized Raman spectra of stoichiometric LaTiO3 (TN = 150 K) were measured between
6 and 300 K. In contrast to earlier report on half-metallic LaTiO3.02, neither strong background
scattering, nor Fano shape of the Raman lines was observed. The high frequency phonon line at
−1 exhibits anomalous softening below TN : a signature for structural rearrangement. The
655 cm
assignment of the Raman lines was done by comparison to the calculations of lattice dynamics and
the nature of structural changes upon magnetic ordering are discussed. The broad Raman band,
which appears in the antiferromagnetic phase, is assigned to two-magnon scattering. The estimated
superexchange constant J = 15.4 ± 0.5 meV is in excellent agreement with the result of neutron
scattering studies.

There is still debate on the role of orbital degrees
of freedom in the antiferromagnetism of LaTiO3 and
whether orbital ordering exists in the antiferromagnetic
phase. Neutron and resonant x-ray scattering results of
Keimer et al.[1] have been interpreted as evidence for
orbital ﬂuctuations, consistent with orbital liquid model
of Khaliullin and Maekawa [2]. It has been pointed out
[1] that earlier Raman results of Reedyk at al.[3], where
large background and Fano shape of the phonon line near
300 cm−1 have been observed, may also indicate orbital
ﬂuctuations coupled to lattice vibrations. Some recent
experimental results on the temperature dependence near
TN of neutron and x-ray diﬀraction, heat capacity and
infrared spectra [4, 5], however, provide evidence for no-
ticeable deformation of TiO6 octahedra and structural
anomaly near the antiferromagnetic ordering, which in-
directly supports the concept of orbital ordering.

The observation in the Raman spectrum of insulating
rare earth titanates of structureless background and Fano
interference is highly unusual. At the same time, it is well
known that transport and magnetic properties of LaTiO3
[7, 8, 9] depend crucially on sample’s stoichiometry. Crit-
ical dependence on stoichiometry may be expected also
for the Raman spectra. Indeed, anomalous variation of
phonon Raman intensities and linewidths has been re-
ported at 50 K for LaTiO3+δ/2 near the metal-to-Mott-
insulator transition at 0.01 < δ < 0.04 [10]. The room
temperature dc resistivity (ρ = 0.02 Ωcm) of the LaTiO3
sample used in the Raman experiments of Reedyk et al.[3]
is much lower than that reported for nearly stoichiomet-
ric samples (ρ > 0.5 Ωcm [7, 8]) and rather corresponds
to δ = 0.04. Therefore, it is of deﬁnite interest to ex-
amine the Raman spectra of stoichiometric LaTiO3 in
a broad temperature range including N´eel temperature
TN . It is plausible to expect that the variation of the
Raman spectra with decreasing temperature below TN
will provide additional information on the controversial
issues of Fano interference and magnetic-order-induced
orbital ordering.

In this paper we present polarized temperature-
dependent Raman spectra of stoichiometric LaTiO3
(TN = 150 K) between 6 and 300 K. At room temper-
ature, in contrast to Ref.[3], neither strong background
scattering nor Fano shape of the Raman lines is observed.
The temperature shift of some Raman lines exhibits clear
anomaly below TN : a signature for structural rearrange-
ment. We discuss the assignment of the Raman lines
to deﬁnite phonon modes and the nature of structural
changes. The broad Raman band, which appears in the
antiferromagnetic phase, is assigned to two-magnon scat-
tering.

LaTiO3 samples were prepared using La2O3 (99.99%),
TiO2 (99.99%) and Ti2O3 (99.99%) as starting materi-
als. La2O3 was heat treated at 1300◦C for 24h and TiO2
was dried for 24h at 120◦C before use. Stoichiometric
amounts of La2O3, Ti2O3 and TiO2 were mixed and
arc melted under argon to form black bulk LaTiO3. X-
ray diﬀraction pattern at room temperature revealed or-
thorhombic structure with lattice parameters a = 5.61 ˚A,
b = 7.91 ˚A, and c = 5.63 ˚A, in agreement with earlier
reports [4, 6]. It is known that the magnetic transition
temperature, TN , is very sensitive to the oxygen content
[8] and it rapidly shifts to lower T if the oxygen composi-
tion exceeds the stoichiometric value of 3 [9]. Therefore,
the value of TN is a precise measure of the oxygen sto-
ichiometry in LaTiO3. The weak ferromagnetism is due
to the asymmetric Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya exchange inter-
action and can easily be picked up in dc-susceptibility
measurements.

For our sample the SQUID magnetometry was em-
ployed to measure the magnetic transition temperature.
Fig.
1(a) shows the inverse susceptibility data mea-
sured at 50 Oe in the temperature range between 5
and 400 K. A sharp drop occurs at 150 K, in excellent
agreement with the best available data for stoichiometric
single crystals [6]. Another supportive evidence, which
points to almost perfect sample stoichiometry,
is the
room temperature conductivity, obtained by Kramers-

trapolates [Fig. 2(b)] to the dc-value of 4.5±0.5 Ω−1cm−1
(ρ = 0.22 ± 0.03 Ωcm), which corresponds to δ < 0.01
[8].

Raman spectra were collected under microscope (fo-
cus spot size 1-3 µm, λexc = 514.5 nm or 632.8 nm) from
freshly cleaved or as-grown surfaces of the bulk material.
The crystallographic orientation of the surface was not
known but in most cases the spectra taken with paral-
lel (HH) and crossed (HV) polarizations of incident and
scattered radiation were totally polarized: an indication
that the surface coincides with one of the main crystallo-
graphic planes (ab, bc or ac). For temperature-dependent
measurements the sample was mounted in a liquid helium
cryostat. As the Raman signals were extremely low, re-
latively high incident laser power (≈ 5 mW) was used,
which resulted in some heating of the microprobe spot.
Fig. 2 shows the polarized Raman spectra of LaTiO3 as
obtained at room temperature from ﬁve diﬀerent spots.
Three Raman lines are clearly pronounced in parallel
(HH) scattering conﬁguration at 133, 252 and 296 cm−1
and four other lines are seen in crossed (HV) conﬁgura-
tion at 182, 418, 465, and 655 cm−1. The phonon line
positions are close to those reported by Reedyk et al.
(see Fig. 2 in [3]), but the background scattering is much
weaker and the lines are narrower. The most signiﬁcant
diﬀerence is the observation of two clearly distinguish-

Taking into account that for LaTiO3+δ/2 one expects an
increase of the electronic background, phonon line inten-
sity and phonon line width with increasing δ [10], the puz-
zling ”Fano shaped” band reported by Reedyk et al.[3]
seems to have simpler explanation as a complex band,

temperature is higher than the nominal one.

is the one at 655 cm−1. As
temperature behavior,
illustrated in Fig. 4, with lowering temperature between
300 K and 130 K this mode hardens and increases in
intensity. Upon further cooling, however, it moves back
to lower wavenumbers and merges with an arising new
broad band centered at about 620 cm−1. The position
of this latter band is independent of temperature within
the experimental error (± 5 cm−1) and it’s intensity
increases much faster compared to intensity decrease of
the 655 cm−1 phonon line.

In order to assign the observed Raman lines to deﬁnite
phonon modes we performed lattice dynamical calcula-
tions (LDC) using a shell model, which has been applied
earlier for isostructural YMnO3 and LaMnO3 [12]. To
evaluate the eﬀect of structural changes, identical cal-
culations were done using the neutron diﬀraction data
of Cwik et al.
[4] for atomic positions at 8 K, 155 K
an 293 K. The LDC results showed that both the pre-
dicted frequencies and shapes of the phonon modes of
LaTiO3 and LaMnO3 are very close. The three HH lines
can unambiguously be assigned to Ag modes involving
mainly motions of La along z (133 cm−1), in-phase rota-
tions around y of neighboring (along y) TiO6 octahedra
(252 cm−1), and O1 motions in the xz plane (295 cm−1),

respectively. The assignment of HV lines is less straight-
forward as to each experimentally observed line one can
juxtapose B1g, B2g or B3g mode of close predicted fre-
quency. Whatever is the choice, the line at 182 cm−1
corresponds to a mode involving mainly motions of La
and the line at 655 cm−1 - to in-phase (B2g) or out-of-
phase (B1g, B3g) stretchings of TiO6 octahedra.

The comparison of frequencies calculated using struc-
tural data for at 8 K, 155 K, and 293 K provides evi-
dence that the softening of the 655 cm−1 mode below
TN is related to the structural changes induced by mag-
netic ordering [4]. These changes include elongation of
TiO6 octahedra along c (in P nma notations) by 0.2%
and shrinking along a by 0.3% and an anomalous short-
ening of the Ti-O1 distance near TN . Indeed, the LDC
results predict hardening of all Raman modes except for
the B1g, B2g and B3g modes near 650 cm−1. The latter
modes have maximum wavenumber at 155 K and then ei-
ther soften by ∼ 1 cm−1 (B1g, B3g), or remain unchanged
(B2g) at 8 K. Interestingly, similar softening below TN
has also been observed for the corresponding B2g mode
in isostructural LaMnO3 [13, 14]. Another result that
follows from the comparison of LCD data of LaTiO3 at
diﬀerent temperatures is that the HH line at 252 cm−1

at 300 K and the broad band at ≈ 290 cm−1 at 6 K
most likely correspond to the same ”soft” mode.
It is
worth noting that all predicted temperature shifts are by
factor 3 smaller than the experimentally observed ones.
The reason for this discrepancy is not clear.

The broad structure between 570 and 650 cm−1 ap-
pears only below TN and strongly increases with low-
ering temperature (see Fig. 5) thus identifying itself as
related to magnetic excitations. The magnon dispersion
curve for LaTiO3 along the pseudocubic [111] direction
was measured by Keimer et al.[1] and ﬁtted by the ex-
pression ~ω = zSJp1.005 − γ2, where ~ω is the magnon
energy, z = 6 is the coordination number, S = 1/2 is the
Ti spin, J = 15.5 ± 1.0 meV is the nearest-neighbor su-
perexchange energy, γ = 1
3 [cos(qxa)+cos(qya)+cos(qza)].
The zone-center magnons (γ = 1, ~ω = 3.3 meV) are
far below our range of measurement and only second-
order magnetic scattering is expected. The intensity of
the two-magnon scattering is determined by the mag-
nitude of the two-magnon density of states, which has
maximum at the zone boundary, and by the interac-
tion of the two magnons created in the scattering pro-
cess. The latter interaction results in creation of a
”bound state”, which decreases the two-magnon energy
by J compared to the sum of individual magnon energies
at the boundary 2zSJ [15, 16]. Therefore, the maxi-
mum of two-magnon scattering for LaTiO3 is expected
at ~ω2M = 2zSJ − J = 5J. The position of the broad
line in the spectra is 620 ± 20 cm−1 (76.9 ± 2.5 meV)
yields J = 15.4 ± 0.5 meV, in excellent agreement with
the results of neutron scattering experiments [1].

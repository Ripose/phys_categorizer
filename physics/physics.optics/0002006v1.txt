”Light bullets” are multi-dimensional solitons which are
localized in both space and time. We show that such solitons
exist in two- and three-dimensional self-induced-transparency
media and that they are fully stable. Our approximate an-
alytical calculation, backed and veriﬁed by direct numerical
simulations, yields the multi-dimensional generalization of the
one-dimensional Sine-Gordon soliton.

The concept of multi-dimensional solitons that are
localized in both space and time, alias ”light bullets”
(LBs), was pioneered by Silberberg [1], and has since
then been investigated in various nonlinear optical media,
with particular emphasis on the question of whether these
solitons are stable or not. For a second-harmonic gener-
ating medium, the existence of stable two- and three-
dimensional (2D and 3D) solitons was predicted as early
as in 1981 [2], followed by studies of their propagation
and stability against collapse [3–6], and of analogous 3D
quantum solitons [7]. In a nonlinear Schr¨odinger model
both stable and unstable LBs were found [8] and it was
suggested that various models describing ﬂuid ﬂows yield
stable 2D spatio-temporal solitons [9]. Recently, the ﬁrst
experimental observation of a quasi-2D ”bullet” in a 3D
sample was reported in Ref. [10].

In this letter we predict a new, hitherto unexplored
type of LBs, obtainable by 2D or 3D self-induced trans-
parency (SIT). SIT involves the solitary propagation of
an electromagnetic pulse in a near-resonant medium, irre-
spective of the carrier-frequency detuning from resonance
[11,12]. The SIT soliton in 1D near-resonant media [13] is
exponentially localized and stable. In order to investigate
the existence of ”light bullets” in SIT, i.e. solitons that
are localized in both space and time, one has to consider
a 2D or 3D near-resonant medium. Here we present an
approximate analytical solution of this problem, which
is checked by and in very good agreement with direct
numerical simulations.

Our starting point are the two-dimensional SIT equa-

tions in dimensionless form [14]

Pτ − EW = 0
(E ∗P + P ∗E) = 0.

Here E and P denote the slowly-varying amplitudes
of the electric ﬁeld and polarization, respectively, W is
the inversion, z and x are respectively the longitudinal
and transverse coordinates (in units of the eﬀective ab-
sorption length αeﬀ ), and τ the retarded time (in units
of the input pulse duration τp). The Fresnel number F
(F > 0), which governs the transverse diﬀraction in 2D
and 3D propagation, is incorporated in x and the detun-
ing ∆Ω of the carrier frequency from the central atomic
resonance frequency is absorbed in E and P [15]. We
have neglected polarization dephasing and inversion de-
cay, considering pulse durations that are much shorter
than the corresponding relaxation times. Eqs. (1) are
then compatible with the local constraint |P|2 + W 2 = 1,
which corresponds to conservation of the Bloch vector
[14].

The ﬁrst nontrivial question is to ﬁnd a Lagrangian
representation for these 2D equations, which is necessary
for adequate understanding of the dynamics. To this end,
we rewrite the equations in a diﬀerent form, introducing
the complex variable φ deﬁned as follows [16]

.

Eqs. (1b) and (1c) can then be expressed as a single equa-
tion, φτ + (E/2)φ2 + (1/2)E ∗ = 0. Next, we deﬁne a vari-
able f so that φ ≡ 2fτ /(Ef ). In terms of f , the previous
equation becomes fτ τ − (Eτ /E)fτ + (1/4)|E|2f = 0. This
equation is equivalent to

Now we proceed to search for LB solutions. Before
resorting to direct simulations, we obtain an analytical
approximation of the solutions. The starting point for
this approximation is the well-known soliton solution for
1D SIT (the Sine-Gordon soliton) [12,14,17]

E(τ, z) = ±2 α sechΘ
P(τ, z) = ±2 sechΘ tanh Θ
W (τ, z) = sech2Θ − tanh2 Θ,

(6a)

(6c)

with Θ(τ, z) = ατ − z
α + Θ0, and α, Θ0 arbitrary real
parameters. Equation (6a) is also called a 2π-pulse, be-
cause its area R ∞

∞ E(τ, z)dτ = ±2π.

Returning to the 2D SIT equations, we notice by
straightforward substitution into Eqs. (3) that a 2D so-
lution with separated variables, in the form E(τ, z, x) =
E1(τ, z)E2(x) (and similarly for f and g), does not exist.
To look for less obvious solutions, we ﬁrst split equa-
tions (1) into their real and imaginary parts, writing
E ≡ E1 + iE2 and P ≡ P1 + iP2:

1 + P 2

2 + W 2 = 1.
obey the normalization condition P 2
They reduce to the Sine-Gordon solution for C = 0.
The accuracy to which Eqs. (8) satisfy Eqs. (7c)-(7e) is
O(αC 2), which requires that |α|C 2 ≪ 1. This is the
single approximation made. Numerical simulations dis-
cussed later on verify that Eq. (8) indeed approximates
the exact solution of Eq. (7) to a high accuracy. In ad-
dition, we have checked that substitution of (8) into the
Lagrangian (5) and varying the resulting expression with
respect to the parameters α and C yields zero. This
”variational approach” is commonly used to obtain an
approximate ”ansatz” solution to a set of partial diﬀer-
ential equations in Lagrangian representation [18]. Equa-
tions (8) represents a light bullet, which decays both in
space and time and is stable for all values of z. The latter
follows directly from (8a) and also from the Vakhitov-
Kolokolov stability criterion [19].

E2xx + E1z − P1 = 0
E1xx − E2z + P2 = 0
P1τ − E1 W = 0
P2τ − E2 W = 0

In the absence of the x-dependence, these equations are
invariant under the transformation (E1,P1) ↔ (E2,P2).
This suggests a 1D solution in which real and imaginary
parts of the ﬁeld and polarization are equal, E1 = E2 and
P1 = P2, and such that the total ﬁeld and polarization
reduce to the SG solution (6). Our central result is an
approximate but quite accurate (see below) extension of
this solution, applicable to the 2D SIT equations.
In
terms of the original physical variables it is given by

verse plane proves to be diﬃcult. However, in the limit
of either large or small r, an approximate analytic so-
lution may be found. For large r, it again takes the
form (8), but now with Θ1 = ατ − z/α + Θ0 + Cr and
Θ2 = ατ − z/α + Θ0 − Cr, where α, Θ0, and C are
constants, |α|C 2 ≪ 1, and it is implied r ≫ 1/|C|. It
is in suﬃciently good agreement (deviations < 5%) with
results of simulation of the 3D equations, using this so-
lution as an initial ansatz. Comparison of Figs. 1 and 4
shows that the 2D and 3D bullets have similar shapes,
but the 3D one decays faster in the radial direction for
small r than the 2D bullet in its transverse direction.

Figs. 1-3 show the electric ﬁeld and polarization, gener-
ated by direct numerical simulation of the 2D SIT equa-
tions (1) at the point z = 1000, using (8) as an initial
ansatz for z = 0. To a very good accuracy (with a de-
viation < 1%), they still coincide with the initial con-
ﬁguration and analytic prediction (8). The electric ﬁeld
has a typical shape of a 2D LB, localized in time and
the transverse coordinate x, with an amplitude 2α and
a nearly sech-form cross-section in a plane in which two
of the three coordinates τ , z and x are constant. The
ratio C/α determines how fast the ﬁeld decays in the
transverse direction. For |C/α| ≪ 1 (then |C| < 1, as
|α|C 2 ≪ 1), we have a relatively rapid decay in τ and
slow fall-oﬀ in the x-direction, as is seen in Fig. 1. In the
opposite case, |C/α| ≫ 1, the ﬁeld decays more slowly in
time and faster in x. The polarization ﬁeld has the shape
of a double-peaked bullet. Its cross-section at constant x
displays a minimum at Θmin ≈ 0, where |P(Θmin)| ≈ 0,
and maxima at Θ± = ±Arcosh(√2), where |P(Θ±)| ≈ 1.
The ﬁeld and polarization decay in a similar way, which
is a characteristic property of SIT [14]. Also the inver-
sion decays both in time and in x, but to a value of −1
instead of zero, corresponding to the atoms in the ground
state at inﬁnity. A numerical calculation of the ﬁeld area
−∞ dτ|E(τ, z, 0)| = 6.28 ± 0.05 ≈ 2π,
irrespective of z. By analogy with the SG soliton, one
might thus name this a ”2π bullet”.

at x = 0 yields R ∞

We have also numerically obtained axisymmetric stable
LBs in a 3D SIT medium, see Fig. 4. The 3D medium is
described by Eqs. (1) with the ﬁrst one replaced by

FIG. 4. The electric ﬁeld in the 3D ”light bullet”, |E|, as a
function of time τ and transverse radial variable r after prop-
agating the distance z = 1000. Parameters used correspond
to α = 1, C = 0.1 and Θ0 = 1000.

For constant τ , the 2D and 3D bullets are localized
in both the propagation direction z and the transverse
direction(s). One may also ask whether there exist SIT
solitons which are traveling (plane) waves in z and lo-
calized in x (and y). Using a symmetry argument, it is
straightforward to prove that they do not exist. Starting
from the SIT equations (1) (in 2D, the 3D case can be
considered analogously) we adopt a plane-wave ansatz for

E and P, changing variables as follows: x → √kx (assum-
ing k > 0), E(τ, z, x) → E(τ, x) exp(−ikz), P(τ, z, x) →
k−1 P(τ, x) exp(−ikz), and W (τ, z, x) → k−1 W (τ, x).
The equations for the real and imaginary parts of the
ﬁeld then become

(10a)

E2xx − E2 − P1 = 0
E1xx − E1 + P2 = 0,

(10b)
with the equations for Pτ and Wτ given by (7c)-(7e). Us-
ing the transformation (E1,P1) ↔ (E2,P2), which leaves
the last three equations invariant but changes the ﬁrst
two, one immediately ﬁnds that (10) only admits the
trivial solution E1 = E2 = P1 = P2 = 0, W = −1.
The observation of ”light bullets” in a SIT process re-
quires high input power of the incident pulse and high

density of the two-level atoms in the medium, in order
to achieve pulse durations short compared to decoher-
ence and loss times. These requirements are met e.g.
for alkali gas media, with typical atomic densities of
∼ 1011 atoms/cm3 and relaxation times ∼ 50 ns [20],
and for optical pulses generated by a laser with pulse
duration τp < 0.1 ns.
In order to include transverse
diﬀraction, the incident pulse should be of uniform trans-
verse intensity and satisfy αeﬀ d2/λ < 1 [20], where λ and
d are its carrier wavelength and diameter respectively
[20]. The parameter α in the solution (8), which deter-
mines the amplitude of the bullet and its decay in time,
corresponds to α ∼ κzτpvp [13], with κz the wavevec-
tor component along the propagation direction z and vp
the velocity of the pulse in the medium, and can thus
be controlled by the incident pulse duration and veloc-
ity. The parameter C ∼ κxLx, where κx is the trans-
verse component of the wavevector and Lx is the spa-
tial transverse width of the pulse, is also controlled by
the characteristics of the incident pulse and should sat-
isfy the condition κzκ2
x ≪ 1. For a homogeneous
(atomic beam) absorber, the eﬀective absorption length
αeﬀ ∼ 104 m−1 and the Fresnel number F can range from
1 to 100 [20]. The bullets then decay on a time scale of
t ∼ 1− 10 τp ∼ 10 ns and transverse length of x ∼ 0.1− 1
mm, which is well within experimental reach.
In conclusion, we predict the existence of fully stable
”light bullets” in 2D and 3D self-induced transparency
media. The prediction is based on an approximate
analytical solution of the multi-dimensional SIT equa-
tions and veriﬁed by direct numerical simulation of these
PDE’s. Our results suggest an experiment aimed at de-
tection of this ”bullet” in an SIT-medium and opens the
road for analogous searches for ”light bullets” in other
nonlinear optical processes, such as, e.g., stimulated Ra-
man scattering, which is analogous to SIT.

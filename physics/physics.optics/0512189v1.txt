We present waveguides with photonic crystal cores, supporting energy propagation in subwave-
length regions with a mode structure similar to that in telecom ﬁbers. We design meta-materials for
near-, mid-, and far-IR frequencies, and demonstrate eﬃcient energy transfer to and from regions
smaller than 1/25-th of the wavelength. Both positive- and negative-refractive index light transmis-
sions are shown. Our approach, although demonstrated here in circular waveguides for some speciﬁc
frequencies, is easily scalable from optical to IR to THz frequency ranges, and can be realized in
a variety of waveguide geometries. Our design may be used for ultra high-density energy focusing,
nm-resolution sensing, near-ﬁeld microscopy, and high-speed all-optical computing.

While light emission by atoms, molecules, quantum
wells, quantum dots and other quantum objects occurs
from regions smaller than 10−8 m-wide, light propaga-
tion takes place on much larger, wavelength scales, rang-
ing from 10−2 m for GHz radar radiation to 10−6 m for
optical light. Such a huge scale diﬀerence, eﬀectively in-
troduces a fundamental barrier between one’s ability to
generate light and to subsequently guide this light. Ineﬃ-
cient cross-scale coupling limits the resolution and sensi-
tivity of near-ﬁeld microscopes[1, 2], prevents fabrication
of ultra-compact all-optical processing circuits[3, 4], in-
tegrated optoelectronic devices[5, 6] and other photonic
systems. Here we present a class of compact waveguides
capable of eﬀective radiation transfer to, from, and in
subwavelength regions. Our approach, although demon-
strated here in circular waveguides for some speciﬁc fre-
quencies, is easily scalable from optical to IR to THz fre-
quency ranges, and can be realized in a variety of waveg-
uide geometries.

A typical waveguide structure comprises at least two
diﬀerent regions: the transparent core that supports en-
ergy propagation, and the cladding that is used to pre-
vent guided light from escaping the core. Although the
design of both core and cladding may vary among diﬀer-
ent waveguides[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], the wave
propagation in the conﬁned spaces has some universal,
design-independent properties. Speciﬁcally, the electro-
magnetic radiation in any waveguide forms a series of
system-speciﬁc waves: waveguide modes. The wavevec-
tor of each mode in the direction of mode propagation kz
is related to the frequency through the following disper-
sion relation[13, 14, 16]:

cut-oﬀ at |kz∆| ≪ 1 corresponding to diﬀraction limit; this
behavior is similar to that of TE modes in PC structures
described in the text. Blue line: TM mode with positive re-

lies on |kz∆| ≪ 1 region (highlighted area and the inset in

perfections. The low-frequency regime (dotted region in the
inset) is not realizable in nature since ǫ(ω → 0) has to be
positive[15].

(red), Si-SiC (blue), and InGaAs-AlInAs (green) PC struc-
tures (see text). The wavevector and radius are normalized to
PC period and free-space wavelength respectively. Note that
the negative-refraction modes propagate only in suﬃciently
thin waveguides[16].

Since the mode propagation is possible only when the
eﬀective refractive index is real, the product of ǫν is
required to be positive for such a propagation to take
place. For the isotropic homogeneous system, the con-
dition n2 > 0 is equivalent to ǫ > 0, ν > 0; n > 0.
Thus, there exists a minimal critical radius of a waveg-
uide supporting at least one conﬁned propagating mode,
πc/(ω√ǫ) = λ/(2√ǫ). The systems with radius
R0 ≃

R < R0, formally described by ǫ > 0, ν < 0, reﬂect al-
most all incoming free-space-like radiation[1, 23], and are
not suitable for energy transfer into subwavelength areas.
The properties of the waveguide modes can be con-
trolled by either changing the mode structure (modify-
ing the parameter m), or by varying the waveguide core
material (modifying the parameter ǫ). Since there ex-
ists only a limited control over the dielectric permittivity
of natural materials, the majority of modern subwave-
length waveguides implement the former technique, and
make use of the special type of modes at the metal-
dielectric interfaces, known as surface waves, which for-
mally correspond to m2 < 0. Although these modes
may in principle be used to transfer radiation to nano-
scale[10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 24], their spatial struc-
ture is fundamentally diﬀerent from that in free-space
waves and telecom ﬁber modes. This structural diﬀer-
ence requires non-trivial coupling mechanisms to convert
the radiation from free-space to surface waves, typically
associated with substantial coupling losses[15, 18].

Here we present an alternative approach to compress
and propagate the radiation below the free-space diﬀrac-
tion limit.
Instead of changing the structure of the
modes, we propose to change the waveguide itself. We
use a periodic array of thin dielectric (ǫ > 0) and “metal-
lic” (ǫ < 0) layers, widely known as a 1D photonic
crystal (PC) medium, as a meta-material waveguide core
(Fig.1a).

In the case of PC layers perpendicular to the direction
of mode propagation considered here, all modes of the
system can be separated into two fundamentally diﬀer-
ent groups. The modes in the ﬁrst group, known as TE
waves, have their electric (E) vector parallel to the lay-
ers, the modes in the second group (TM waves) have their
magnetic (H) vector parallel to the layers. Similar to the
case of a homogeneous waveguide described above, the
frequency and wavevector of a wave in a PC-core ﬁber
can be related through the dispersion relation:

In a way, the PC core plays the role of a homogeneous but
anisotropic uniaxial meta-material with its optical axis
parallel to the direction of mode propagation[21]. The
existence of propagating modes in these systems can be
once again related to the eﬀective index of refraction n.
The propagation of TE modes is completely analogous
to the wave propagation in isotropic systems described
earlier.
In contrast to this behavior, the PC structure
can support TM waves in two fundamentally diﬀerent
regimes. The ﬁrst regime, described by ǫT M
P C >
0 corresponds to positive index of refraction, while the
second one, ǫT M
P C < 0 describes a negative re-
fraction case[16, 25, 26, 27, 28], unachievable in conven-
tional ﬁber- and plasmonic- waveguides[2, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 17, 18].

P C > 0; νT M

P C < 0;νT M

Both n > 0 and n < 0 structures may support wave
propagation in highly-conﬁned areas (Fig. 1). Indeed, the
eﬀective refractive index of a propagating TM mode in
substantially thin (R
λ) strongly anisotropic system
is inversely proportional to a mode conﬁnement scale R.
The decrease in R is accompanied by a decrease of “inter-
nal” wavelength λ/
, virtually eliminating the diﬀrac-
|
tion limit in proposed structures.

Furthermore, the PC waveguides with diﬀerent refrac-
tive indices can be combined together, opening the door
for the eﬀective phase manipulation of light propagating
in highly-conﬁned areas. The possibility of such a ver-
satile light management on nanoscale is one of the main
points of this work.

The self-adjustment of PC waveguide modes to the
waveguide size, accompanied by compatibility between
the mode structure in PC waveguides, telecom ﬁbers,
and free-space makes the PC systems ideal candidates
for eﬀective energy transfer between macroscopic wave-

coupling structures, called photonic funnels, the size of
the PC waveguides gradually varies along the direction of
mode propagation, squeezing the light into nm-sized ar-
eas much like a conventional funnel squeezes water into
a thin bottleneck, which is another main point of this
work.

The eﬃciency of energy compression in photonic fun-
nels can be related to adiabaticity parameter δ =
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)[13, 15], that deﬁnes the reﬂection by the fun-

nel structure, and absorption in the system. Increase of
the funnel’s length typically reduces reﬂection loss, but
increases absorption.

We now illustrate the light propagation in PC struc-
tures described here. Although our design does not
impose any limitations on the waveguide geometry or

(dashed and dotted lines). Only 10−10 of energy is transmit-
ted from R = 2.3µm to R = 0.35µm ∼ λ/31. This behavior is
similar to that in tips of near-ﬁeld microscopes[1, 2]. (b) ﬁeld

waveguide boundary material, here we use conical waveg-
uides with perfectly conducting metallic walls (see [29])
and circular cores, having adiabaticity parameters δ
∼
0.1 . . . 0.3, and defer the optimization of a photonic fun-
nel geometry to future work. To demonstrate scalability
of our design we calculate light propagation through the
PC formed by (i) 100-nm-thick layers of SiC and Si with
operating wavelength λ = 11µm, (ii) 15-nm-thick layers
of Ag and Si with operating wavelength λ = 1.2µm, and
(iii) 75 nm-thick InGaAs layers doped with electrons to
1019 cm−3, and 150 nm AlInAs barriers with operating
wavelength λ = 20µm. (Fabrication of these structures is
accessible through standard MOCVD, e-beam writing, or
MBE techniques; see Refs. [10, 19, 30, 31] and references
therein).

To compute the light propagation in conical struc-
tures, we represent each structure by an array of cylin-
drical segments (in a way, this approach also accounts
for the eﬀects related to ﬁnite roughness of waveguide
walls, unavoidable in any experiment). The typical ra-
dius step in our calculations is 10−3λ. We then represent
the ﬁeld in each cylindrical segment as a series of modes
of a circular waveguide. We use Eqs.(2,3) to calculate

Ag, Si, SiC, and AlGaAs[32] and use Drude approach to
describe InGaAs[15]. Finally, we use the boundary con-

λ = 20µm. The passive structure transmits 6% of radiation
from R = 2.4µm to R = 0.45µm ∼ λ/44. The material gain
in active system (ǫAlInAs ≃ 10 − i) compensates for losses
in the funnel structure and yields energy in R = 0.45µm to
be 112% of the incident one. Similar to Fig. 2, the internal
wavelength is proportional to R

ditions to relate the modes in one segment to the modes
in the neighboring segment, solving the problem of wave
propagation through a photonic funnel.

In Fig.2 we demonstrate the perspectives of photonic
funnels by comparing the energy propagation through
mid-IR PC waveguide with positive refraction described
above to the propagation through the Si-core structure
with identical geometry[33]. As expected, despite almost
adiabatic radius compression, the energy in Si-core sys-
tem reﬂects from the point corresponding to the cut-
oﬀ radius of about 1.2µm.
In contrast to this behav-
ior, PC system eﬀectively compresses energy, and the
propagation in the structure with radius as small as
0.35µm
λ/30 is clearly seen. This PC provides a so-
lution to the fundamental problem of coupling to the
subwavelength domain, and allows transferring 13% of
energy, which is 109 times better than its Si counterpart.
The eﬀective energy transfer across multiple scales
in “negative-refraction” near- and far-IR PC systems is
shown in Fig.3. Our calculations suggest that Ag-Si sys-
tem may be used to transfer more than 20% of energy to
near-ﬁeld zone. We expect that this number can be fur-
ther optimized by reducing the wave reﬂection (currently
21%).

The performance of the PC-based waveguides is lim-
ited by the PC microstructure, and by material absorp-
tion. The former introduces implicit inhomogeneity scale
(PC period), where the “eﬀective medium” approxima-
tion [Eq. (3)] breaks down. The spatial dispersion, asso-
ciated with ﬁeld inhomogeneities on such a scale, leads
to the mode cut-oﬀ and prohibits the mode propagation
when the radius of a waveguide becomes smaller than
PC period. The appearance of such a cut-oﬀ is shown in
Fig. 1c.

∼

Material losses, on the other hand, lead to energy at-
tenuation and limit the length of passive photonic funnels
to
10λ which is acceptable for the majority of applica-
tions of these systems: near-ﬁeld tips, ultra-compact de-
tectors, wires in all-optical circuits, etc. This limitation
is not applicable to waveguides with active cores. Indeed,
material absorption can be substantially reduced, elimi-
nated, or even reversed by implementing a gain medium
into ǫ > 0 regions of PC[34]. We illustrate this approach
in Fig. 3d by introducing moderate gain into AlInAs part
of the far-IR structure, which can be realized via quan-
tum cascade technology[30, 35].

Finally, we note that operating frequency of the pho-
tonic funnels described here can be changed from optical,
to near-IR, to far-IR, to THz domain by varying the PC
composition and periodicity. The PC-based waveguides
may be used in ultra-compact all-optical and electro-
optical devices, near-ﬁeld microscopy, and other appli-
cations requiring eﬀective sub-diﬀraction and cross-scale
energy transfer, as well as in a variety of nonlinear optical
applications[36] in positive- and negative-index materials
since the energy compression and corresponding enhance-
ment of local ﬁeld will result in the strong enhancement
of nonlinear ﬁeld moments.

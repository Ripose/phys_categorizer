Abstract

The temporal dynamics of a storage-ring Free Electron Laser is here investigated
with particular attention to the case in which an external modulation is applied to
the laser-electron beam detuning. The system is shown to produce bifurcations,
multi-furcations as well as chaotic regimes. The peculiarities of this phenomenon
with respect to the analogous behavior displayed by conventional laser sources are
pointed out. Theoretical results, obtained by means of a phenomenological model
reproducing the evolution of the main statistical parameters of the system, are
shown to be in a good agreement with experiments carried out on the Super-ACO
Free Electron Laser.

1 Introduction

Since its advent, the laser has evolved as a unique tool both for fundamental investigations
and important applications in optical science and technology [1]. In providing coherent
and intrinsically stable emission, lasers result fundamentally diﬀerent from conventional
light sources, which are characterized by a signal that is composite of random and uncorre-
lated emissions. Anyway, the view of the laser emission as an ordered and time-invariant
process does not provide a complete description of the whole picture. During the last
twenty years, profound mathematical discoveries have revolutionized the understanding
of nonlinear science. Lasers, in particular, have been found to exhibit a rich variety of
nonlinear dynamical behaviors, including unstable or even chaotic regimes. As in the
case of other nonlinear dynamical systems, the transition from stable to chaotic dynam-
ics is obtained by varying a control parameter, such like the losses of the cavity [2], its
optical length [3] or the gain of the ampliﬁcation process [4]. The transitions are found

to follow well-deﬁned paths, regardless of the peculiar characteristics of the considered
system. These universal “signatures” motivated both experimentalists and theoreticians
in the search for physical systems exhibiting such phenomena, and in the investigation of
their intrinsic similarity.
Concerning lasers, ﬁrst experimental studies have been carried on a CO2 laser [2], [3].
It has been found that the modulation at a frequency f of the chosen control parameter
may result not only in oscillations with frequency nf , being n an integer number, but also
in a response at the sub-harmonics f /n. When the order n of the sub-harmonics grows
indeﬁnitely, the response of the laser becomes irregular, though the system remains deter-
ministic. A quite impressive similitude has been remarked between the “multi-furcation”
diagram of the laser and that of the logistic map [11]. In order to reproduce these ex-
perimental results, a simple theoretical model has been used, resting on the dynamical
interplay between the electromagnetic ﬁeld within the optical cavity, and the variables
of the material employed as “active medium”. Theoretical work has been also done for
demonstrating that the chaotic behavior of a laser can be stabilized either by using a
self-controlling feedback procedure [12], [13] or by a further modulation of a control pa-
rameter [14], [15] .
Experimental evidences of a close link with deterministic chaos has also been given in
the pioneering work [4] for a kind of non-conventional laser source: a storage-ring Free
Electron Laser (SRFEL).
After the ﬁrst operation of a FEL in the infrared spectral range on a linear accelerator
in 1977 [5], a second FEL was installed on the storage ring ACO and provided the ﬁrst
visible radiation in 1983 [6]. Present Storage Ring based FELs still supply the shortest
FEL wavelength in the oscillator conﬁguration (on ELETTRA [7]) and in the harmonic
generation scheme (on Super-ACO [8]). User applications performed since 1993 on the
Super-ACO FEL have demonstrated the very good quality oﬀered by such sources in terms
of tunability, high average power, rather short pulse duration and high degree of coherence
[9]. These characteristics make, for example, the FEL very suitable for two colours exper-
iments performed in combination with the naturally synchronized synchrotron radiation
[10].
A SRFEL, the principle of which is shown in Figure 1, is a coherent source of radiation
in which the active medium consists of an ultra-relativistic electron beam, moving in a
periodic magnetic undulator. The alternating magnetic ﬁeld forces the electrons to move
along sine-like trajectories and, consequently, to emit radiation, known as spontaneous
emission. Once stored in the optical cavity, the radiation is ampliﬁed to the detriment of
the kinetic energy of the electrons. This process generally leads to the increase of the rms
value of the particles energy (the so-called electron beam energy spread) and, as a con-
sequence, to the reduction of the ampliﬁcation gain, until this latter reaches the level of
the cavity losses. Since it origins from synchrotron radiation, the SRFEL output presents
a micro-temporal structure with a period of the order of hundred of nanoseconds, which
is determined both by the longitudinal dimension of the electron bunch and by the beam

revolution period. On a larger (millisecond) temporal scale, the SRFEL dynamics depends
strongly on the longitudinal overlap between the electron bunch(es) and the laser pulses
at each pass inside the optical cavity (detuning condition). As it is shown in Figure 2 for
the particular case of Super-ACO, a given detuning leads to a cumulative delay between
the electrons and the laser pulses: the laser intensity may then appear “cw” (for a weak or
strong detuning) or show a stable pulsed behavior (for intermediate detuning) [16], [17],
[7]. The narrow “cw” zone of the detuning curve (few ps around the perfect synchronism)
is generally the most interesting for user applications. In fact, when in this zone, the laser
is characterized by the maximum average power and the signal is the most close to the
Fourier limit [18]. In order to keep the laser-electron beam synchronism and avoid the
jittering, which could determine a migration towards one of the unstable, pulsed zones of
the detuning curve, eﬃcient feedback systems have been implemented on the Super-ACO
[19] and UVSOR FELs[20]. SRFELs are complex, strongly coupled dynamical systems.
The strong laser-electron beam coupling origins from the fact that, unlike a LINAC based
Free Electron Laser, where the beam is renewed after each interaction, electrons are re-
circulated. As a consequence, at every light-electron beam energy exchange, the system
keeps memory of previous interactions.

The work that will be presented in this paper starts from the results obtained in 1990
on the Super-ACO FEL [4].
In the latter reference, it was experimentally shown that
a periodic modulation at a given frequency f of the laser-electron beam detuning may
lead to a period doubling of the laser intensity (i.e. to a laser response at a frequency
f /2) or even to chaos for more important modulation amplitudes. Reference [4] contains
also a ﬁrst attempt to deﬁne the conditions (i.e. the amplitude and the frequency of the
modulation) for which the bifurcation most likely occurs. The experimental data were
discussed in connection with a simpliﬁed model based on a set of phenomenological rate
equations, accounting for the coupled evolution of the laser intensity, of the electron-beam
energy spread and of the gain of the ampliﬁcation process. Such a model allowed to re-
produce the basic features of the laser intensity evolution (in particular the saturation
mechanism) only close to the perfect synchronism between the laser pulse and the electron
bunch. This was a limiting factor for developing a comprehensive theoretical picture. In
fact, the fundamental role played by the detuning has been only later understood: in [21]
such eﬀect has been shown to be responsible for the behavior of the laser intensity (“cw”
or pulsed) on the millisecond scale and to produce a further gain reduction over that
induced by the increase of the electron-beam energy spread. The simple model presented
in reference [21] was then improved by including the detuning eﬀect on the whole laser
intensity distribution. This allowed to ﬁnd a qualitative agreement between experiments
and numerical results, for the case of the Super-ACO FEL [22].
It is worth to stress that the loss of the laser-electron beam longitudinal overlapping may
be induced by diﬀerent phenomena such like a vibration of the cavity mirrors at the line
frequency [23] or a modulation of the electron beam energy [24].

In this paper an improved version of the model presented in [21] is used to get a deeper
insight (with respect to that obtained in [4]) into the physics of deterministic chaos in a
SRFEL. Numerical simulations are compared to a set of experiments performed on the
Super-ACO FEL. In Section 2 the model is presented and shown to be able to reproduce
quantitatively the observed features of the detuned FEL dynamics. Section 3 discusses
the modiﬁcations induced to the dynamics by assuming an externally modulated detun-
ing. Bifurcations, as well multi-furcation, are shown to occur for both the intensity and
centroid position of the laser distribution. In Section 4 experimental results are presented.
Finally, Section 5 contains concluding remarks and perspectives.

2 Theoretical model

The longitudinal dynamics of a SRFEL can generally be described by a system of rate
equations accounting for the coupled evolution of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and of the
longitudinal parameters of the electron bunch [21].
The temporal proﬁle of the laser intensity, yn, is updated at each pass, n, inside the optical
cavity according to:

yn+1(τ ) = R2yn(τ

ǫ) [1 + gn(τ )] + is(τ ),

−

where τ is the temporal position with respect to the centroid of the electron bunch dis-
tribution; R is the mirror reﬂectivity; the detuning parameter ǫ is the diﬀerence between
the electrons revolution period (divided by the number of bunches) and the period of
the photons inside the cavity; is accounts for the spontaneous emission of the optical
klystron1. The FEL gain gn(τ ) is given by:

where gi and σ0 are the initial (laser-oﬀ) peak gain and beam energy spread, while σn
and στ,n are the energy spread and the bunch length after the nth light-electron beam
interaction. The ﬁrst exponential in the right-hand side of equation (2) accounts for the
modulation rate of the optical-klystron spectrum2, while the second one reproduces the
temporal proﬁle of the electron bunch distribution. The bunch distribution is therefore
assumed to keep its “natural” Gaussian proﬁle under the action of the laser onset. This
hypothesis entails that the interaction of the electron beam with the ring environment
1 The case of SRFELs implemented on an optical klystron is here considered [25], [26]. An optical
klystron consists of two undulators separated by a dispersive section, (i.e. a strong magnetic ﬁeld) favoring
the interference between the emission of the two undulators.

2The laser-oﬀ peak gain has been optimized by assuming N + Nd = 1/(4πσ0) in the expression of the
modulation rate, where N is the periods’ number of the undulators of the optical klystron and Nd is the
interference order due to its dispersive section [27].

concern to the case of Super ACO.

Note that in the derivation of eq. (6) the variation of the bunch length during the FEL
interaction has been taken into account. In this respect, the present model represents an
improvement of the one proposed in [21], where the additional assumption σn = σ0 in the
deﬁnition of gn,0 is made. A systematic numerical comparison allowed to show that this
simpliﬁcation may alter the period of the laser intensity in the pulsed regime, that is, as
it will be shown in the next Sections, a parameter of paramount importance for the study
the laser response to an external modulation.

operated with only the main radio-frequency (RF) cavity. The parameters characterizing
this conﬁguration, which is the one of concern for the experiments reported in this paper,
are listed in Table 1.

It is worth to mention that Super ACO can be also operated making use of an ad-
ditional RF (harmonic) cavity [31], which has been installed with the aim of improving

the FEL performances.
Its eﬀect results in a shortening of the electron bunch. The
consequent increase of the electron density leads to the enhancement of the gain of the
ampliﬁcation process. On the other hand, the interaction of the electron beam with the
ring environment (i.e. the metallic wall of the ring vacuum chamber) is also reinforced.
This leads to a degradation of the electron beam quality (i.e. “anomalous” increase of
the laser-oﬀ bunch length vs. current and deformation of temporal beam distribution)
limiting in part the beneﬁcial eﬀect of electron-density increase [32]. As regards the shape
of the electron beam temporal distribution, the interaction with the ring vacuum chamber
induces a perturbation of the “natural” Gaussian proﬁle of the electron beam: the higher
the cavity voltage, the stronger becomes the head-tail eﬀect [33] deforming the electron
distribution. It is worth to stress that, due to relative high value of the Super-ACO vac-
uum chamber impedance [34], the anomalous bunch lengthening and the perturbation of
the beam proﬁle are signiﬁcant even when the harmonic cavity is passive. For the purpose
of this paper, these perturbations can however be neglected in ﬁrst approximation.
A quasi-symmetric beam proﬁle reﬂects in a detuning curve that is almost symmetric for
positive and negative detuning amounts (see Figure 2). The structure of the detuning
curve has been studied by making use of the theoretical model presented above. The
extension of the central (“cw”) and lateral (pulsed) zones, which are the “playground”
of the experiments that will be discussed in the next Sections, has been found to be well
reproduced (see caption of Figure 4). Figure 4 shows the regimes of the laser intensity for
diﬀerent detuning amounts. Again, the numerical results have been found in quantitative
agreement with experiments. Concerning, in particular, the pulsed regime, a careful ex-
perimental and numerical analyses [22] pointed out that the period of the laser-intensity
oscillations is not a constant (as it has been implicitly assumed in [4]) but it is instead an

almost linear function of the detuning amount.
The eﬀect of an imperfect light-electron beam longitudinal overlapping also inﬂuences the
equilibrium position of the laser centroid. As shown in Figure 5 [35], the laser position
is quite sensitive to small detuning amounts, while it attains an almost constant value as
the side zones of the detuning curve are approached.
Numerical simulations are in agreement with experiments (see Figure 6) and allow to
detail the interesting behavior of the laser centroid in the close-to-zero detuning region.

3 Numerical simulations for modulated detuning

Consider now the modiﬁcation induced to the system dynamics by the cumulative eﬀect
of an external periodic modulation applied to the detuning ǫ, namely:

ǫ = a sin(2πf t) + b,

(7)

where t represents the time elapsed, integer multiple of ∆T ; f is the frequency of the
oscillation, while the two amplitudes a and b control the maximum detuning amount. The
oscillations are centered around b, being a the maximum elongation. Tuning the value of
b, allows to explore the eﬀects induced by the modulation in diﬀerent zones. Simulations
have been performed based on the model previously introduced, the main motivation
being a systematic comparison with preliminary results of experiments carried on in Su-
perACO. This point is addressed in the next Section. This paragraph is instead devoted
to a more generally-oriented analysis, concerning the peculiar phenomena, that have been
numerically found.

As already discussed in the previous Section, several diﬀerent regimes are produced in
a SRFEL, for constant detuning amounts. For small ǫ the laser displays a “cw” intensity,
while larger values of ǫ drive the system into stable oscillations. This “natural” pulsed
regime is of paramount importance for the present study. The right boundary of the
central, symmetric, “cw” zone will be labeled as ǫth.
Consider ﬁrst the case for which b is set to zero. Hence, the average modulation is also
zero. The external forcing, deﬁned by equation (7), leads to a stable (1T ) response only
for small values of a, which prevent excursion of the modulated detuning outside the
boundaries of the “cw” zone. When this excursion occurs, the modulation is generally
found to induce a chaotic response of the laser intensity.
Quite diﬀerent scenario is produced when b is set to some small value diﬀerent from zero.
This choice corresponds to introducing a slight asymmetry which, surprisingly enough, is
responsible of a signiﬁcant regularization of the signal4. In Figure 7 the laser intensity
4 Note that this case can be considered more realistic than the previous one. In fact, even when the
laser is operated as close as possible to the perfect tuning, a slight, uncontrollable, shift (corresponding
to a b value of the order of one or two fs in the case of Super ACO) has to be generally expected.

is displayed as function of time, the upper panel being the modulation of ǫ. Simulations
refer to a ﬁxed value of the frequency while the amplitude is varied. The transition from
a 1T to a 2T clearly occurs. It is worth stressing that the latter regime is observed for
a > ǫth.
In Figure 8 the laser intensity is plotted as function of time. Again, simulations refer to
diﬀerent values of a, while b and f are maintained constant. For small values of a, the
laser response is locked to the frequency of the external modulation, thus displaying a 1T
regime. For larger values the laser intensity passes through a chaotic region and, ﬁnally,
attains a stable 3T regime.
In Figure 9 the position of laser centroid is represented, as function of time, for the same
choice of parameters as in Figure 7. Oscillations are displayed and a transition from a 1T
to 2T regimes is observed. This is, indeed, a quite general result: each time a bifurcation
of the laser intensity takes place, an analogous response is observed for the position of the
centroid.
Summing up, a wide number of distinct behaviors are recovered and, within them, bifur-
cations of both intensity and centroid position of the laser, depending on the values of the
parameters a and f . For a < ǫth , i.e. when the oscillation is conﬁned in the central “cw”
zone of the detuning curve (few ps), the system is locked to the frequency imposed by the
modulation and laser intensity exhibits regular oscillations of frequency f . As soon as the
value of a exceeds the threshold ǫth, a cascade can occur. Therefore, one is led to conclude
that excursions in the pulsed regime are a necessary requirement for the modulations to
produce more complex behaviors. It is, in fact, believed that the observed periodic struc-
tures could be the result of the combined eﬀect of the external and natural modulations.
In addition, the system seems to be more sensitive to the natural frequencies (which, for
the case of Super-ACO, lie between 400 Hz and 630 Hz), even though multi-furcations
have been detected outside this privileged range. These observations mark an important
point of distinction with similar studies on conventional lasers, being the pulsed regime
an intrinsic characteristic of the SRFEL.
Another interesting feature regards the value, ˆa, of the modulation amplitude for which
the transition from 1T regime to more structured behaviors (i.e. 2T , 3T , . . . ) occurs.
Numerically it has been observed that increasing the frequency , the value of ˆa signiﬁ-
cantly decreases. This phenomenon, has been systematically observed in a wide range of
frequencies (i.e. 200 Hz to 900 Hz). For larger values of f , the system is insensitive to
the rapid external modulation, which therefore becomes ineﬀective.
Further, numerical simulations allowed to detect narrow windows, for which more com-
plex periodic structures (i.e. 4T , 5T , 6T , 8T ...) are displayed. Nevertheless, the existence
of universal paths towards deterministic chaos remains an open issue.
Similar analysis have been carried out for larger values of b, such that the modulation is
stably centered in one of the pulsed zones (see Figure 10). This condition is achieved for
small enough values of the amplitude a. Numerical results produce remarkable features,
which will be commented in the following. As already pointed out in Section 2, the fre-

quency of the oscillation in the pulsed zone was shown to increase linearly with ǫ [22].
Assume fp to be the frequency of the natural oscillation which is found for ǫ = b, being
a = 0. When the modulation of ǫ is switched on and the condition:

n
f

(8)

is fulﬁlled, the laser shows oscillations of frequency f /n, characterized by m peaks, spaced
with period 2π/fp (see Figure 10, which refers to n = 2 and m = 3). Deviations are ob-
served when condition (8) is no longer satisﬁed (for instance, by progressively changing
the value of b). Note, however, that such behavior occurs for discrete values of f , and
are not maintained over a ﬁnite set of frequencies. Hence, its characterization in term of
multi-furcation is, somehow, stretched. Further experimental investigations will be ad-
dressed to validate these numerical ﬁndings.
Finally, an extensive campaign of simulations has also been performed varying the fre-
quency f of the modulation, while keeping a ﬁxed. A small value has been again assigned
to the parameter b, in such a way that the center of the oscillations falls in the region of
“cw” laser. A typical results is reported in Figure 11, where a cascade 1T
3T
is shown to occur. It is again worth to stress the crucial role that seems to be played by
the pulsed zone.

4 Experimental results and their interpretation

Experiments have been performed by modifying the longitudinal overlap between the laser
pulse and the electron bunch. This is done by modulating the radio-frequency in such a
way that the variation of the detuning ǫ, in the form speciﬁed by equation (7), is achieved.
Diﬀerent results have been obtained by varying either the modulation amplitude (keeping
f constant) or the modulation frequency (for ﬁxed value of the amplitude of the modula-
tion).
In Figure 12 the evolution of the laser intensity is investigated, when adopting the ﬁrst
procedure: f is set to a value close to the largest natural frequency. For small amplitudes
of the modulation, a noisy 1T regime is observed. A transition toward a 2T response
is produced when a is larger than ǫth, in qualitative agreement with the general picture
outlined in the previous Section. Larger values of a induce a chaotic response, before a
stable 3T regime is attained (see Figure 8, for a qualitative comparison).
2T transition is observed when varying the modulation frequency.
In Figure 13, a 1T
Again, the bifurcation has been found to occur for an amplitude of the modulation large
enough to drive the laser in the pulsed zone of the detuning curve. The transition is
observed when f approaches the lowest natural frequency. This result is in a good agree-
ment with the numerical simulations shown in Figure 11, which suggest that a further
bifurcation 2T
3T could have been found, for larger frequencies. In addition, the
frequency for which the transition is shown to occur, increases when the amplitude of

→

the modulation is reduced (see Figure 13). This result conﬁrms the prediction of the
theoretical analysis.
The response of the FEL to an external modulation of the laser-electron beam detuning
has been also investigated by means of a double sweep streak camera. In particular, in
Figure 14 the occurrence of a period doubling of the laser centroid is detected.

5 Conclusions

A complete analysis of the dynamics of a SRFEL in presence of a longitudinal laser-
electron beam detuning has been performed. Numerical simulations, based on the model
discussed in [22], and experimental results have been compared and shown to agree quan-
titatively, for a constant value of ǫ.
Further, the eﬀect of an external modulated ǫ has been considered. The system has
been shown to display bifurcations, multi-furcations as well chaotic regimes for both the
laser intensity and the position of its centroid, when either the amplitude or frequency
of the modulation are tuned. Numerical analysis and preliminary experiments carried on
for SuperACO, agree in this respect. Moreover, a detailed series of simulations, over a
wide range of values of the modulation parameters, allowed to point out the crucial role
played by the naturally pulsed zones of the SRFEL detuning curve. This observation,
conﬁrmed by a careful analysis of the experimental data, seems to indicate that the link
with analogous investigations for conventional lasers is not trivial, the pulsed regime being
an intrinsic characteristic of the SRFEL.
In addition, conventional laser are shown to produce a complete cascade towards determin-
istic chaos, similar to that of the logistic map. In the case of SRFEL, experiments proved
clearly the existence of 2T and 3T regimes, as well of chaotic behaviors. Nevertheless, a
progressive increase of the periodicity of the structures was not observed. Numerically,
the interstitial regions laying between stable signals and chaotic regimes have been object
of a detailed analysis. More complex periodic structures have been clearly detected (4T ,
5T , 6T , 8T ...), even though, the attempt of identifying recurrent paths has, so far, failed.
However, it is worthwhile stressing that the latter are shown to hold for a narrow range of
tunability of the parameters. Hence, the transition from a low periodicity signal to chaos
is generally sharp.
Finally, a complete understanding of the laser response in presence of an externally mod-
ulated detuning could allow to improve the performances of the FEL. It has in fact been
proven in [12]-[15] that the chaotic behavior of a conventional laser can be successfully
stabilized.
It is planned to investigate deeper this possibility, being interested in the
development of new self-controlling procedure.

Figure 2: A typical detuning curve (i.e. the laser intensity as a function of the laser-
electron beam detuning amount) obtained for the case of the Super-ACO FEL operated
in a conﬁguration with only the main RF cavity. The synchronisation between the laser
pulse and the electron bunch is changed by means of a modiﬁcation of the RF frequency
(a variation of 1 Hz inducing a laser-electron beam detuning of 1.2 fs). The employed
experimental conditions are those reported in Table 1, with a total beam current of about
40mA.

Figure 3: Schematic layout of the pass-to-pass laser-electron beam interaction. ∆T stands
for the period between two successive interactions, τ ∗ is the position of the laser centroid
with respect to the peak of the electron density and ǫ accounts for the laser-electron beam
detuning at each pass.

Figure 4: Numerical results obtained by making use of the parameters listed in Table 1
and reproducing the diﬀerent “natural” regimes of the laser intensity displayed in Figure
2. The “cw” regime in the nearly zero-detuning region (see Figure a)) is found to have an
extension of (about) 10 fs (
5 fs around the perfect tuning). The stable pulsed regimes,
observed for an intermediate (positive and negative) detuning amount (see Figure b)), has
an extension of (about) 35 fs. The lateral “cw” regimes (observed for large detuning values
(see Figure c)), are found to have an extension of the order of few hundred of fs. Note
that these theoretical ﬁndings reproduce quantitatively the experimental results reported
in Figure 2. The laser intensity is normalised to the equilibrium value it reaches in the
central “cw” zone of the detuning curve.

Figure 8: Numerical simulations performed for f = 600 Hz. Figure a) shows the laser
intensity vs. time for a = 10 f s and b = 2 f s. The system is locked to the frequency of the
external modulation, thus displaying a 1T regime. Figure b) represents the laser intensity
vs. time, for a = 20 f s and b = 2 f s. An a-periodic signal is found. In ﬁgure c), for
a = 30 f s (and b = 2 f s), the system shows a 3T structure in qualitative agreement with
experimental results of Figure 12.

Figure 13: Experimental response of the laser intensity to the detuning modulation. Here
the amplitude a = 42 f s. Figure a) shows the laser intensity vs. time (thick solid line) for
f = 174 Hz. The thin solid line represents the detuning modulation (arbitrary units). The
system displays a 1T regime. In Figure b) the laser intensity (thick line) is represented
vs. time, for f = 377 Hz. Again, the thin line refers to ǫ. A clear 2T response is found
to occur. In Figure c), the values of the frequency for which the system experiences the
transitions from a 1T to a 2T regime, are plotted vs. the amplitude a. The decreasing
tendency is clearly displayed.

position of the laser centroid. Here f = 250 Hz and the modulation amplitude has been

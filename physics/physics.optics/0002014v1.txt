Dynamics of Atom-Mediated Photon-Photon Scattering I: Theory

Department of Physics, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA

M. W. Mitchell and R. Y. Chiao

(February 2, 2008)

The mediated photon-photon interaction due to the resonant Kerr nonlinearity in an inhomo-
geneously broadened atomic vapor is considered. The time-scale for photon-photon scattering is
computed and found to be determined by the inhomogeneous broadening and the magnitude of the
momentum transfer. This time can be shorter than the atomic relaxation time. Eﬀects of atom
statistics are included and the special case of small-angle scattering is considered. In the latter case
the time-scale of the nonlinear response remains fast, even though the linear response slows as the
inverse of the momentum transfer.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently there has been experimental and theoretical
interest in the nonlinear optics of conﬁned light [1]. A
medium possessing an optical Kerr nonlinearity and con-
ﬁned within a planar or cylindrical Fabry-Perot resonator
gives rise to new nonlinear optical phenomena such as
soliton ﬁltering and bilateral symmetry breaking [2,3].
The classical nonlinear optics of this system is described
by the Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE)

where E is the electric ﬁeld envelope, k is the longitudinal
wavenumber, ω = ck/n0 is the ﬁeld envelope angular fre-
quency, A is a mode overlap factor, ∆k is the wavenum-
ber mismatch from the linear-cavity response and Γ is
the ﬁeld amplitude decay rate. The classical dynamics
of Eq. (1) describes the mean-ﬁeld behavior of a system
of interacting photons coherently coupled to an external
reservoir. A photonic system of this sort is a versatile
model system for condensed matter physics in reduced
dimensions [4], as the parameters ∆k,n2, Γ, and Ed in
Eq. (1) are subject to experimental control. In partic-
ular, an atomic vapor can provide a strong Kerr nonlin-
earity which is tunable both in strength and in sign. In
this case the nonlinearity arises from the saturation of
the linear refractive index, which is a strong function of
the drive laser frequency near an absorption resonance.
Some of the most interesting proposed experiments
for this system,
few-photon
bound states [5], direct observation of the the Kosterlitz-
Thouless transition in an optical system [4] and observa-
tion of quantum corrections to the elementary excitation
spectrum of a 1D photon gas [6,7] intrinsically involve
photon correlations. For this reason, it is important to
understand the microscopic (and not just mean-ﬁeld) be-
havior of photons in an optical Kerr medium. We speciﬁ-
cally consider saturation of the resonant electronic polar-
ization of a Doppler-broadened atomic vapor, a medium

including generation of

which has been proposed for quantum cavity nonlinear
optics experiments and used to observe a nonlinear cavity
mode [2]. Thus the system under consideration involves
dispersion, loss, inhomogeneous broadening, and the con-
tinuum of transverse modes in an extended resonator.

Sophisticated techniques have been developed for
treating mediated interactions among photons in non-
linear media. One approach is to obtain an eﬀective
theory in which the quanta are excitations of coupled
radiation-matter modes, by canonical quantization of the
macroscopic ﬁeld equations [8,9], or by direct attack
on a microscopic Hamiltonian [10]. This approach has
the advantage of generality and is suited to multi-mode
problems, but has basic diﬃculties with loss and disper-
sion near resonance [11–13]. Microscopic treatments in-
clude Scully-Lamb type theory [14,15] and application of
phase-space methods [16,17]. A strength of these tech-
niques is their ability to handle relaxation and popula-
tion changes. They are, however, cumbersome to apply
to inhomogeneously broadened media and to multi-mode
problems.

In this paper we characterize the atom-mediated
photon-photon interaction using an accurate microscopic
model and perturbation calculations. This allows us to
determine the time-scale of the mediated photon-photon
interaction in the atomic vapor, despite the complexity
of the medium. We ﬁnd that the interaction is fast and
not intrinsically lossy, even for small momentum trans-
fer. Thus the medium is suitable for quantum optical
experiments, including experiments using the NLFP as a
model for the interacting Bose gas.

II. SCATTERING CALCULATIONS

The complete system is treated as the quantized elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld interacting via the dipole interaction
with an vapor of atoms of mass M . The perturbation
calculations are performed in momentum space, as is nat-
ural for thermodynamic description of the atomic vapor.
This also makes simple the inclusion of atomic recoil ef-
fects. The dipole interaction term is identiﬁed as the

1

perturbation, so that the eigenstates of the unperturbed
Hamiltonian are direct products of Fock states for each
ﬁeld.
In the rotating wave approximation, the unper-
turbed and perturbation Hamiltonians are

where ak,α is the annihilation operator for a photon of
momentum ¯hk and polarization α, cn,p is the annihila-
tion operator for an atom in internal state n with center-
of-mass momentum ¯hp, E is the quantized electric ﬁeld
and d is the atomic dipole ﬁeld. Polarization plays only a
very minor role in this discussion so polarization indices
will be omitted from this point forward.

The simplest mediated interaction is photon-photon
scattering, which transfers momentum from one pho-
ton to another by temporarily depositing this momen-
tum in the medium.
Speciﬁcally, photons with mo-
menta k, l are consumed and photons with momenta
k′ ≡ k + q, l′ ≡ l − q are produced. The lowest-order
processes to do this are fourth order, so we look for rel-
evant terms in H ′H ′H ′H ′. A parametric process, i.e.,
one which leaves the medium unchanged, sums coher-
ently over all atoms which could be involved [18]. Due
to this coherence, the rates of parametric processes scale
as the square of N/V , the number density of atoms. In
contrast, incoherent loss processes such as Rayleigh and
Raman scattering scale as N/V . Thus for large atomic
densities, a given photon is more likely to interact with
another photon than it is to be lost from the system.

In this sense, the interaction is not intrinsically lossy,
as are some optical Kerr nonlinearities such as optical
pumping or thermal blooming. The latter processes re-
quire absorption of photons before there is any eﬀect on
other photons. For this reason, they are unsuitable for
quantum optical experiments such as creation of a two-
photon bound state.

One parametric process, photon-photon scattering at
a single atom, is described by the diagram of Fig. 1. The
relevant terms in H ′H ′H ′H ′ contain

Here p is the initial atomic momentum and a through d
index the atomic states involved. With the assumption
that no atoms are initially found in the upper states b

where the n are number operators for the atomic modes
and the upper and lower signs hold for Bose and Fermi
gases, respectively. The diﬀerence for atoms of diﬀer-
ent statistics reﬂects the fact that the scattering process
takes the atom through an intermediate momentum state
which could be occupied. Occupation of this intermedi-
ate state enhances the process for Bose gases but sup-
presses it for Fermi gases.

the process is understood to conserve photon momen-
tum, but for clarity of presentation this is not explicitly
indicated.

As described in Appendix A, intensity correlation func-
tions for photon-photon scattering products contain a
Fourier transform of the scattering amplitudes

where δk′ is the output photon energy shift, xA,B and
tA,B are detection positions and times, respectively, and
τ− ≡ tB − xB/c − tA + xA/c is the diﬀerence in retarded
times. This expression allows us to determine the time
correlations for photon-photon scattering in a number of
important cases.

III. LARGE-ANGLE SCATTERING

The simplest conﬁguration to understand is that of
counterpropagating input beams producing counterprop-
agating output photons scattered at large angles. This is
also the most convenient experimental geometry.

A. One Atom Process

Scattering amplitudes and rates for right-angle scatter-
ing by the one-atom process are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig.
3, respectively. For the moment we ignore the statistical
correction due to the na,pnc,p−q term in Eq. (7), which
will be considered separately. The the vapor is treated as
a gas of two-level atoms. The parameters are the Doppler
width δD ≡ k(kBT /M )1/2, where kB is Boltzmann’s con-
stant, the radiative linewidth γb = AE/2 where AE is the
Einstein A coeﬃcient, and the detuning ∆ ≡ ck− ωba, in
the ratios γb = 0.01δD, ∆ = 2πδD. The amplitude units
are arbitrary, but do not vary between graphs.

At this point it is important to note that the dura-
tion of the correlation signal is much shorter than the
coherence lifetime of an individual atom, approximately
γ−1
. In fact, the duration of the correlation signal is de-
b
termined by the momentum distribution, a property of
the medium as a whole. This can be explained in terms
of the coherent summation of amplitudes for scattering
processes occurring at diﬀerent atoms. The process is
coherent only when it is not possible, even in principle,
to tell which atom participated. This clearly requires
momentum conservation among the photons, but it also
limits the duration of the atomic involvement. An atom
acting as intermediary to transfer momentum q is dis-
placed during the time in remains in the state c of Fig. 1.
If this displacement is larger than the thermal deBroglie
wavelength Λ it is possible, in principle, to determine
which atom participated. This limits the duration of the
coherent process to δτ ∼ ΛM/¯hq.

Λ ≡ (M kBT /2π¯h2)1/2 is the thermal deBroglie wave-
length. Parameters are as for Fig. 2.

C. Simultaneous scattering

A second parametric process, simultaneous scattering,
is described by the diagram of Fig. 5. The relevant terms
in H ′H ′H ′H ′ contain

or permutations k′ ↔ l′, k ↔ l for a total of four terms.
Making the same assumption as before, this reduces to

na,pnc,p−qa†

k′alak.

(13)

This process corresponds to the absorption of each pho-
ton by an atom before emission of either, and thus de-
scribes a two-atom process and is of the same order in
the atomic number density as the Fermi and Bose cor-
rections to single-atom scattering. The kinematical and
geometric factors of Eq. (7) and Eq. (9) are the same for
this process, and the resonance denominators are

Amplitudes for simultaneous scattering are shown in
Fig. 6 for a gas with a phase space density of one half.
Parameters are as for Fig. 2.

(14)

D. Fermi and Bose Gases

The statistical correction and two-atom scattering con-
tributions add coherently, giving considerably diﬀerent
correlation functions for moderate degeneracy Bose vs.
Fermi gases. This is illustrated in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8,
which show the scattering rates vs. delay for Bose and
Fermi gases with a phase space density of one half. Pa-
rameters are as for Fig. 2.

B. Statistical Correction

E. Ladder Process

As noted above, the quantum statistics of the atoms
in the vapor contribute a correction to the single-atom
scattering amplitude. This correction (with the sign
appropriate for Bose atoms) is shown in Fig.
4 for
a gas with phase space density N Λ3/V = 1/2, where

In atoms with a “ladder” level structure, in which three
levels a–c are ordered in energy ωc > ωb > ωa and con-
nected by matrix elements µba, µcb 6= 0, µca = 0, an
additional process described by the diagram of Fig. 9 is
possible. The relevant terms in H ′H ′H ′H ′ contain

This process corresponds to the absorption of both pho-
tons by an atom before emission of either, and thus de-
scribes a one-atom process which is of the same order in
the atomic number density as one-atom scattering. The
kinematical and geometric factors of Eq. (7) Eq. (9) are
the same for this process, and the resonance denomina-
tors are

(17)

Right-angle scattering amplitudes for this process are

shown in Fig. 10. Parameters are as for Fig. 2.

F. Lorentz-model Behavior

It is interesting to consider the case of a ladder atom
with equal energy spacing ωcb = ωba and matrix elements
|µcb|2 = 2|µba|2. In this case the states a–c are equivalent
to the lowest three levels of a harmonic oscillator, i.e., to
a Lorentz model, and the medium is eﬀectively linear for
two-photon processes.

The amplitudes for the one atom process of Eq. (4)
and the ladder process of Eq. (15) partially cancel. The
resulting signal is smaller and lacks oscillations, as shown
in Fig. 11. Parameters are as for Fig. 2.

G. Background Events

In addition to the photon-photon scattering processes,
Rayleigh scattering (and Raman scattering for more
complicated atoms) will create an uncorrelated coinci-
dence background. This background is calculated in Ap-
pendix A. The coincidence signal, consisting of both
the Lorentz-model atom photon-photon scattering sig-
nal and the incoherent background is shown in Fig. 12.
The peak coincidence rate (at δτ = 0) is approximately
twice the background, accidental coincidence rate.
In
the limit of large detuning, it becomes exactly twice ac-
cidental rate. This can be explained in analogy with
the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss eﬀect as follows: For the op-
timal geometry the drive beams are conjugates of each
other H(x) = G∗(x) and the detectors are in opposite

4

directions. The linear atoms act to create a random in-
dex grating which scatters a chaotic but equal (up to
phase conjugation) ﬁeld to each detector. As expected for
chaotic light [19], the fourth-order equal-time correlation
function is twice the product of second-order correlation
functions.

(cid:10)E2(xA, t)E2(xB, t)(cid:11) = 2(cid:10)E2(xA, t)(cid:11)(cid:10)E2(xB, t)(cid:11) . (18)

IV. SMALL-ANGLE SCATTERING

Thus far the discussion has involved only large-angle
scattering. In the context of cavity nonlinear optics all
ﬁelds are propagating nearly along the optical axis of the
cavity so it is necessary to consider scattering processes
for nearly co-propagating or nearly counter-propagating
photons. As argued above, the temporal width of the
correlation signal scales as 1/q, the inverse of the mo-
mentum transfer. This is shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14,
which show rates for scattering photons from beams in
the x–z plane into the the y–z plane.
In all cases the
beam directions are 0.1 radian from the z axis. The co-
incidence distribution shows oscillations which die out
on the time-scale of the inverse Doppler width, and a
non-oscillating pedestal with a width determined by the
momentum transfer q.

The pedestal, however, does not correspond to the du-
ration of the nonlinear process in this case. As above, by
considering a ladder atom with the energy spacings and
matrix elements of a harmonic oscillator we can isolate
the linear optical behavior. As shown in Fig. 15 and
Fig. 16, this behavior includes the pedestal, but not the
oscillations, indicating that the nonlinear optical process
is still fast, with a time-scale on the order of the inverse
Doppler width.

V. LIMITATIONS ON SCATTERING ANGLE

Due to the limited width of the atomic momentum
distribution, the resonance denominator R(1)
is small if
2
the input and output photons are not of nearly the same
energy. Since the complete process must conserve pho-
ton momentum, input photons with net transverse mo-
mentum in the output photon direction will scatter less
strongly. The width of this resonance is very narrow: a

net transverse momentum ky + ly ∼ kpkBT /M c2 is suf-
ﬁcient that few atoms will be resonant. As pkBT /M c2

is typically of order 10−6 in an atomic vapor, this would
be a severe restriction on the transverse momentum con-
tent of the beams in a cavity nonlinear optics experiment.
However, as shown in Fig. 16, the narrow resonance as-
sociated with R(1)
contributes the linear response of the
2
medium. The nonlinear response, which has the same

resonance character as the “ladder” process, is not lim-
ited in this way because R(3)
2 does not depend upon the
output photon energies.

VI. OUTPUT POLARIZATION

The polarization of the output photons depends on
the structure of the atom and can produce polarization-
entangled photons. For example, if the input photons are
propagating in the ±z directions and are x polarized, the
two absorption events in the above diagram change the z
component of angular momentum by δm = ±1. In order
for the process to return the atom to its initial state, the
two emission events must both produce δm = ±1 or both
δm = 0. For right angle scattering with the detectors in
the ±y directions, the output photons must therefore be
either both x or both z polarized. If both polarizations
are possible, the emitted photons are entangled in polar-
ization, as well as in energy and in momentum.

VII. CONCLUSION

Time correlations in photon-photon scattering provide
an indication of the time-scale over which the atomic
medium is involved in the interaction among photons
in a nonlinear medium. It is found that the time-scale
is determined by the inhomogeneous broadening of the
medium and the magnitude of the momentum transfer.
For large-angle scattering, the time-scale of involvement
is δτ ∼ ΛM/¯hq, while for small-angle scattering the time-
scale is δτ ∼ ΛM/¯hk. As this time-scale is shorter than
the atomic relaxation time, calculations which contain an
adiabatic elimination of the atomic degrees of freedom
necessarily overlook the fastest dynamics in this process.

APPENDIX A: PHOTON CORRELATIONS

1. Detection Amplitudes

Unlike a genuine two-body collision process, atom-
mediated photon-photon scattering has a preferred ref-
erence frame which is determined by the atomic mo-
mentum distribution. To calculate the photon cor-
relations we work in the “laboratory” frame and as-
sume the momentum distribution is symmetric about
zero. We consider scattering from two input beams

with beam shapes G(x) ≡ V −1/2Pk g(k) exp[ik · x] and
H(x) ≡ V −1/2Pl h(l) exp[il · x] which are normalized as
Pk |g(k)|2 = Pl |h(l)|2 = 1. We further assume that the

beams are derived from the same monochromatic source
and are paraxial, i.e., that g(k) is only appreciable in
some small neighborhood of the average beam direction
k0, and similarly for h(l) around l0. The geometry is
shown schematically in Fig. 17. For convenience, the

beams are assumed to each contain one photon, so that
the initial state of the ﬁeld is

We can similarly treat the output photons in the parax-
ial approximation for the case that the detection points
are far from the interaction region, i.e., that xA, xB ≫ x.
Making these approximations and dropping unphysical
portions of the solution propagating inward from the de-

The probability for a coincidence detection at two de-
tectors of speciﬁed area and in two speciﬁed time inter-
vals is

P = Z d2xAd2xBcdtAcdtB|A(xA, tA, xB, tB)|2,

(A10)

where the integral is over the detector surfaces (each as-
sumed normal to the line from scattering region to de-
tector) and over the relevant time intervals. This is more
conveniently expressed in terms of a rate W of coinci-
dence detections in terms of the detector solid angles
δΩA, δΩB and the diﬀerence in retarded arrival times
τ− ≡ τB − τA
Ax2
W = c2x2

B|A(xA, tA, xB, tB)|2δΩAδΩBdτ−.

(A11)

Coincidence rate is largest when the detectors are
placed in the directions which satisfy the phase-matching
condition. We assume that k + l = k′ + l′ = 0 and that
the detectors are small compared to the source-detector
distance, i.e., that δΩA,B ≪ 1. Under these conditions,
the rate of coincidence events reduces to

Wscattering =

3. Signal Contrast

In addition to the photon-photon scattering signal, un-
correlated Rayleigh and Raman scattering events give a
background of accidental coincidences. The rate of scat-
tering into a small solid angle δΩ is

WBG = BδΩZ d3xnk

(A13)

and nk is the number density of photons propagating in
the k direction. In terms of the beam-shape functions for
two colliding beams, the rate of accidental coincidences
is

Waccidental = B2(cid:20)Z d3x|G(x)|2 + |H(x)|2(cid:21)2

The ratio of coincidences due to photon-photon scatter-
ing to accidental background coincidences is thus

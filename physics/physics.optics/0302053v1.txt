Plane waves in Kerr media spontaneously generate paraxial X-waves (i.e. non-dispersive and
non-diﬀractive pulsed beams) that get ampliﬁed along propagation. This eﬀect can be considered
a form of conical emission (i.e. spatio-temporal modulational instability), and can be used as a key
for the interpretation of the out of axis energy emission in the splitting process of focused pulses in
normally dispersive materials. A new class of spatio-temporal localized wave patterns is identiﬁed.
X-waves instability, and nonlinear X-waves, are also expected in periodical Bose condensed gases.

The dynamics of focused femtoseconds pulses (FFP)
in optically nonlinear media has a fundamental impor-
tance and it is relevant in all of the applications of ul-
trafast optics. The basic mechanism, when dealing with
the propagation in normally dispersive materials, is the
splitting of the pulse, which has been originally predicted
more than ten years ago [1, 2] and recently reconsid-
ered, due to the development of the physics of FFP.
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

If z is the direction of propagation, t is the time in the
x2 + y2
reference frame where the pulse is still, and r =
the radial cylindrical coordinate, this process can be
roughly divided into a series of steps. They describe
the propagation of a gaussian (in space and time) pulse,
which travels in a focusing medium, and undergoes rel-
evant reshaping, due to the interplay of diﬀraction, dis-
persion and the Kerr eﬀect (when the peak power is suﬃ-
ciently greater than the critical power Pc for self-focusing
[1, 2]): 1) the out of axis energy is focused towards r = 0
around t = 0; 2) the pulse at r = 0 is compressed; 3)
lobes appear in the on-axis temporal spectrum; 4) the
pulse splits in the time domain.
Before the breakup, relevant out of axis energy emis-
sion and re-distribution occurs, as originally described by
Rothenberg in Ref. 2. Looking to the spatio-temporal
proﬁle an X-shape (or hyperbola) is observed before
the splitting (see, e.g., ﬁgures in [10, 12]). This pro-
cess has been theoretically described by diﬀerent ap-
proaches [10, 12, 14, 15], and the onset of an X-shape
can be ultimately related to the hyperbolic character-
[16] This
istics over which small perturbations evolve.
can be checked, for example, by the hydrodynamical ap-
proach to the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation.[17, 18]

Recently, attention has been devoted to the existence
of X-waves in optically nonlinear media. The latter
are self-trapped (i.e. non-diﬀracting and non-dispersive)
waves that are well known in the ﬁeld of linear propaga-
tion in acustics [19, 20, 21, 22] and in electromagnetism
[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. The simplest X-wave
has the shape of a double-cone, or clepsydra, that ap-
pears as an X when, e.g., a section is plotted in the plane
(x, t), and as V in the plane (r, t), as shown in ﬁgure 1.
Optical X-waves in nonlinear media have been theoret-

ically predicted in [31] and experimental results, with a
direct observation of the conical spatio-temporal shape,
have conﬁrmed their existence and generation in crystals
for second-harmonic generation (SH-G) [32, 33, 34]. In
Ref. 35 it has been theoretically shown how, during non-
depleted-pump SHG, the phase matched spatio-temporal
harmonics let the SH beam become an X-wave. [48]

Conical emission (CE), or spatio-temporal modula-
tional instability (MI) ([14, 36, 37, 38]), has been ad-
dressed in Ref. 39 as a basic mechanism underlaying the
spontaneous formation of an X-wave and, as a founda-
tion for the understaing of the splitting, in Ref. 10. In
this Letter I consider the formation of X-waves in Kerr
media (or in quadratic media, in the regime where they
mimic cubic nonlinearity, see, e.g., the chapter after Tor-
ruellas, Kivhsar and Stegeman in [40] and Ref. 41). A
new form of instability of plane waves can be introduced
by directly involving self-localized spatio-temporal wave
the
patterns. The process strongly resembles CE, i.e.
ampliﬁcation of plane waves from noise, but in this case
X-waves, instead of periodical patterns, emerge from the
breakup of an unstable pump beam. This mechanism
is responsible of the ﬁrst stage of the pulse-splitting,
i.e.
the out-of-axis energy redistribution, such as MI
breaks a continuos wave signal into a periodical pattern
of solitons.[42]

The wave equation describing the propagation in non-
linear Kerr media, whose refractive n index obeys the law
n = n0 + n2I, with I the optical intensity, in the frame-
work of the paraxial and of the slowly varying envelope
approximation, is written as

The perturbation is thus

ǫ = [α + i(β + 2χa

0αz)]ψX (r, t)

with α and β arbitrary real-valued constants. Equa-
tion (8) represents an X-wave which grows linearly along
propagation (independently on the sign of χ), with am-
pliﬁcation given by the intensity of the plane wave aP .
This situation strongly resembles MI, where plane waves
are exponentially ampliﬁed at the expense of the pump
beam, with a gain determined by the pump intensity. For
this reason, it is natural to refer to this process as X-wave
instability. As for MI, the ampliﬁed wave can be artiﬁ-
cially externally feeded, or it can be generated by noise.
[49] Note also that X-wave instability can be triggered
Indeed, as shown in [39], the lat-

ter generates the required spectrum to form an X-wave,
which eventually gets ampliﬁed, as discussed above.

The previous treatment can be generalized in several
ways. In particular it is possible to show that exponential
ampliﬁcation of X-wave-like beams can be attained. It is
necessary to enlarge the deﬁnition of X-waves, i.e. Eq.
(3), by introducing the equation:

ψ = κψ,

(9)

(cid:13)
with κ a real constant (κ
= 0 in the following). Letting
ǫ = µ(z)ψ(r, t) + ν(z)∗ψ(r, t)∗ in (6), and setting to zero
the coeﬃcients of ψ and ψ∗ the following linear system
is obtained:

i∂zµ + κµ + a2

Remarkably ψX still holds when referring to the Helmotz
equation, instead of the paraxial wave equation (see e.g.
Ref. 44). Its plot is given in ﬁgure 1.

X-wave instability can be introduced in the same way
as MI, i.e. by perturbing the plane-wave solution of (2):

(14) depends on two parameters ∆ and κ; while the ﬁrst
determines the decay constant as going far from the ori-
gin in the (r, t) plane, the latter completely changes the
shape of the wave. Examples for ∆ = 1 and κ = 1 are
shown in ﬁgure 3 and in ﬁgure 4 for ∆ = 1 and κ =
1.
Note that they are similar to the Bessel pulse beams de-
scribed in [29]. To clarify the diﬀerences, I observe that
the spatio-temporal spectrum develops around the curve
ω2 = k2
⊥ + κ, with ω the angular frequency correspond-
ing to t and k⊥ the transversal wavenumber. In ﬁgure 5 I
show the spectra for diﬀerent κ, with κ = 0 correspond-
ing to the simplest X-wave ψX . The appearance of this
lines in the spatio-temporal far ﬁeld is a clear signature
of the X-waves instability, and can be directly observed
in the experiments. Note that the spectra resemble the
shape of the wave in the physical space as a consequence
of their propagation invariance.

To show that X-wave instability can actually be ob-
served in the experiments I numerically solved Eq.

In conclusion I have shown that a plane wave in Kerr
media gives rise to linear and exponential ampliﬁcation of
X-waves, thus leading to a signiﬁcat beam reshaping. A
new class of X-waves is involved in this nonlinear process.
The reported analysis provides insights for the interpreta-
tion of the pulse-splitting of focused femtosecond beams,
and related phenomena, in the same way as MI is relevant
for solitons generation. Indeed, the spostaneous forma-
tion of an X-wave can be another explanation of the out
of axis energy redistribution typically observed. X-wave
instability can also be an eﬀective approach for the con-
trolled generation of non-dispersive and non-diﬀractive
pulses.

These results appear to be susceptible of several gener-
alizations, as considering quadratric nonlinearity or vec-
torial eﬀects, and have implications in all the ﬁelds en-
compassing nonlinear wave propagation, as acustics, hy-
drodynamics and plasma physics. For example, X-wave
instability (as well as nonlinear X-waves) is also expected
in periodical Bose-Einstein Condensates where Eq. (2)
holds, being t the direction of periodicity, in the presence
of negative eﬀective mass. [45, 46]

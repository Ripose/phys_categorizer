DENSITY EFFECTS IN FORWARD SCATTERING OF
RESONANT LIGHT IN RUBIDIUM VAPOR

SZYMON PUSTELNY, WOJCIECH LEWOCZKO AND WOJCIECH GAWLIK

Abstract. Transmission of light through an atomic sample placed between
crossed polarizers in a magnetic ﬁeld is jointly determined by Faraday rotation
and net absorption: transmission increases with rotation and decreases with
absorption. Both rotation and absorption are proportional to the atomic den-
sity N0, hence, in a certain range of N0, the two eﬀects may compete yielding
a distinct density dependence of the transmitted light. We have studied such
dependence in rubidium vapor for N0 = 7.5 × 109 - 7.5 × 1011 at/cm3 with
resonant laser light. We present interpretation of the competition eﬀect and
discuss its possible application for atomic density determination.

1. Introduction

Studies of magneto-optical eﬀects in atoms and molecules have a long tradition.
The advent of tunable lasers stimulated renewed interest in the nonlinear magneto-
optics. Numerous papers are describing various aspects of this nonlinearity (see
reference[1] for recent review). In the systems with ground state (or other long-
lived lower levels) of angular momentum J
= 0, the magneto-optical nonlinearities
are due to optical pumping and Zeeman coherences. Optical pumping changes the
saturation conditions for a given transition by aﬀecting the sublevel populations
whereas the Zeeman coherence allows interference of quantum paths linking diﬀer-
ent sublevels. These eﬀects give rise to an optical anisotropy which can be easily
studied experimentally.

One important application of magneto-optical studies is the determination of
optical density and thus a measurement of oscillator strength (dipole moment) of a
given transition when the number density is known or, inversely, of atomic densities,
when the transition probability is known. Examples of such applications of linear
Faraday eﬀect are the measurements of relative oscillator strengths in neon [2] and
sodium [3] and of atomic vapor density of optically thick potassium vapors [4].

The present work describes experimental and theoretical analysis of transmission
of resonance laser light by atomic vapors positioned between crossed polarizers in
a weak longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld (forward scattering - FS) under conditions of
nonlinear light-matter interaction. In general, the FS signal, i.e. the transmitted
light intensity vs. magnetic ﬁeld, depends on the polarization anisotropy both
in atomic absorption and dispersion.
In such context FS has been analyzed for
conventional light sources in early works of G. W. Series and coworkers [5], and for
laser light by W. Gawlik et al.[6]. For a medium of length L, placed between crossed
polarizers and characterized by refractive indices n± and absorption coeﬃcients κ±
for the σ± polarized light, the intensity of the forward-scattered monochromatic

where I0 is the incident light intensity. The FS signal is non-zero only if the
medium possesses some optical anisotropy between the σ+ and σ− light polariza-
tions. An important cause of such anisotropy is a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld which
splits the n±(ω) and κ±(ω) proﬁles. The ﬁrst part of Eq. (1) describes the eﬀect
of medium dichroism whereas the second part is due to its birefringence weighted
by a net absorption. For the light frequency ω tuned exactly to the atomic tran-
sition frequency ω0 and for linear magnetic splitting, the appearance of a nonzero
FS signal is caused exclusively by the second part of expression (1), i.e. by the
birefringence. The exact shape of the FS signal dependence on the magnetic ﬁeld is
aﬀected by a combined eﬀect of birefringence and total absorption κ+ + κ−. In the
case of nonlinear interaction with the light beam, this dependence may have the
form of a narrow sub-Doppler, or even subnatural, resonances, (see, e.g. references
[1, 6]). The two properties of the medium, birefringence and total absorption, scale
diﬀerently with the atomic density which results in speciﬁc density/temperature
characteristics of the FS signals discussed below. We hope that these characteristic
density dependences would be useful for determination of the optical density of
atomic samples.

In the next section we describe our setup and present experimental results. In
Sec. 3 we present theoretical calculations and interpretation of the experiment.
Finally, we conclude in Sec. 4.

2.1. Apparatus. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. We used an external
Fe = 2 of the 85Rb D1
cavity diode laser tuned to the hfs component Fg = 3
line. The laser frequency was stabilized by an external stabilization system based on
Doppler-free dichroism[7]. The light beam of 2 mm diameter was linearly polarized
and its power was varied by rotation of a λ/2-waveplate in the range 0 to 4 mW. The
laser light was passing through a 5 cm long cylindrical glass cell of 2 cm diameter
ﬁlled with the natural mixture of 85Rb and 87Rb and no buﬀer gas. The cell was
heated by a nonmagnetic heater to temperatures between 20 oC and 70 oC which
1011 at/cm3
yielded saturated vapors with densities in the 7.5
range. A pair of Helmholtz coils produced the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld of -3 G to
3 G value. The cell and the coil system were surrounded by a three-layer magnetic
shield made of mu-metal. Polarizer P and crossed analyzer A were mounted outside
the shield. In that geometry, detector D placed behind the analyzer registered only
the FS signal due to rotation of the polarization plane of the transmitted light
and/or its ellipticity [5]. Part of the incident beam was directed to the saturation
spectroscopy system which served as frequency reference.

2.2. Results. The FS signals , IF S(B), were recorded as a function of the magnetic
ﬁeld B for various temperatures and light intensities. The narrowest features in
signals are caused by nonlinear Faraday eﬀect due to ground-state optical pumping
and Zeeman coherences. A typical plot of that part of the FS signal is presented
in Fig. 2. The amplitude of the signal, deﬁned as AF S in Fig. 2, depends on the
light intensity and concentration of the atomic vapors. In Fig. 3 we summarize the

3

results of the amplitude vs. temperature T dependences taken for various intensities
I0.

For the studied range of intensities between 1 mW/cm2 and 6 mW/cm2 the
signals exhibit characteristic structure:
for low temperature their amplitudes in-
crease with T then reach their maxima and subsequently decrease with T . The
temperature of the maximum amplitude shifts with the light intensity. For high
temperatures almost no light is transmitted through the cell between crossed po-
larizers. For very high light intensity (above 100 mW/cm2), the maximum shifts
even beyond the range of temperatures available with our setup (Fig. 4).

We have veriﬁed that the amplitude of the FS signal is a nonlinear function of the
light intensity. This could be expected as the intensities we were using were close
to, or higher than, the saturation intensity which for rubidium is 1.6 mW/cm2. It
can be thus expected that the interplay between rotation and absorption is aﬀected
by diﬀerent saturation behavior of the dispersive and absorptive atomic properties.
Such diﬀerent saturation eﬀect is manifest in Fig. 3 by a shift of the maxima
towards higher temperatures with increasing I0.

3. Interpretation

The properties of the maxima in the AF S(T ) dependences, described above,
are independent of the detailed mechanisms responsible for the FS signals. The
maximum occurs for linear, as well as for nonlinear Faraday rotations. For nonlinear
Faraday eﬀect, it appears no matter if the FS signals have natural or sub-natural
widths, i.e. if they are due to population eﬀects or Zeeman coherences. The detailed
nature of atomic birefringence and absorption mechanism aﬀects only the range of
the concentrations (temperatures) where the maximum is visible.

This property can be illustrated by the following simple arguments. For exact

resonance, δ = 0, only second part of Eq.(1) diﬀers from zero, hence

(2)

IF S/I0 = sin2(αN0)e−βN0,

where α/β = 1

2 (n+ −

n−)/(κ+ + κ−) and N0 is the atomic concentration. For
a given atomic transition, cell length, magnetic ﬁeld and light intensities, α and β
are constants mutually related by the Kramers-Kronig relation [8]. IF S/I0 is thus
an universal function of N0, parameterized by the ratio α/β. Generally, the speciﬁc
value of the ratio depends on particular atomic energy level structure, mechanism
of interaction with the external ﬁelds and their intensities. However, for the value
of the magnetic ﬁeld corresponding to maximum rotation, i.e. to maximum of IF S
which is investigated in this work, the splitting of atomic magnetic sublevels is
nearly equal to their width which results in α/β of the order of 1. By virtue of
the Kramers-Kronig relation the value of α/β at a given B is nearly insensitive
to details of the atomic structure and to the nature of optical anisotropy. With
α/β = 1, expression (2) represents a strongly damped oscillatory dependence on
N0, dominated by the ﬁrst oscillation. These oscillations are nonlinear counterparts
of those described in reference [3].

For more quantitative interpretation of our experimental results we use semiclas-
sical approach of forward scattering and density matrix formalism[9] to calculate
the refractive indices n and absorption coeﬃcients κ

To check to what extent the density dependence of AF S(N0) is insensitive to
particular model, and to verify that the X model does not oversimplify the inter-
pretation, we have additionally applied another model, the Λ-type structure (Fig.
5b). That second model allows proper analysis of the coherence eﬀects, such as co-
herent population trapping (CPT) [10], and their consequences for magneto-optical
properties of the medium. However, analytical solutions and velocity integration
are much more diﬃcult within the second model. For this reason, in this paper
we concentrate exclusively on the X model. Nevertheless, we have veriﬁed by nu-
merical calculation with the Λ model that Zeeman coherence eﬀects do not change
qualitative predictions of the X model [11].

Within our model, the refractive indices and absorption coeﬃcients for both

laser was tuned only to the Fg = 3
Fe = 2 component, the contribution of
another one has been neglected. Apart from a very simpliﬁed atomic structure, the
present analysis also does not take into account speciﬁc relaxation mechanisms, e.g.
velocity-changing collisions[14].

Results of the simulations of the FS signal amplitude vs. atomic concentration
are shown in Fig. 6 for various light intensities. To get best quantitative agreement
of our calculations with the experiment it was necessary to take neq = 0.13, rather
than 1/2. Most likely, this reduction of the eﬀective population is due to hyperﬁne
optical pumping in rubidium atoms, not taken into account by our simple models.
As the experimental results were recorded vs. vapor temperature, the atomic
density in Eq. (11) has to be expressed as a function of the vapor temperature.
This is accomplished by the Arrhenius relation

(13)

N0(T ) = Ae−B/T + C,
where A, B, and C are the ﬁtting parameters. With the values A, B and C obtained
from data provided by reference [15] we calculated the temperature dependences of
the FS signals shown in Fig. 7.

7

Comparison of Fig. 3 with Fig. 7 shows that the simulated signals are very
similar to the experimental ones and show the same general character. For low
temperatures the FS amplitude scales as a square function of the concentration N0.
This part of the dependences is determined only by the dispersive properties of the
medium. For higher temperatures the absorption starts to play an important role
and cannot be neglected anymore. The interplay between dispersion and absorption
produces the maximum of the FS amplitude signal. For even higher temperatures
the absorption of the transmitted light becomes dominant and the amplitudes of
the FS signals decrease exponentially with concentration N0. In addition to this
temperature/density dependence, the FS amplitude rises and shifts with increase
of the incident light intensity. The shifts of the maxima positions for various light
intensities are due to diﬀerent saturation behavior of the dispersion and absorption
coeﬃcients which aﬀects the α/β ratio in Eq. (2).

4. Conclusions

The speciﬁc eﬀect of competition between polarization rotation and absorption,
described above, shows up in the FS signals. The FS intensity, given by Eq. (12),
increases with the medium birefringence (as sin2 of the Faraday angle) and decreases
exponentially with the medium absorption. Competition of these opposite trends
is responsible for the observed maxima of the dependences seen in Figs. 3 and 7.
Appearance of this competition is universal feature, independent on whether the
light-matter interaction has linear or nonlinear character. The possible nonlinearity
only aﬀects the absolute scale of the rotation and absorption and, consequently, the
range of densities where the competition occurs. For alkali metal vapors and for
light intensities of the order of 1 mW/cm2, the resonant nonlinear Faraday eﬀect
allows observation of such a competition already in a low-density range, about
1010 at/cm3, which requires temperatures not much higher than the room
N0 ≈
temperature. The onset of optical nonlinearity not only lowers the density at which
the characteristic maximum of the AF S(N0) dependence appears but results in its
shift with the light intensity. This is due to diﬀerent saturation behavior of the
dispersive and absorptive atomic properties.

We note that the main features of the discussed dependences do not depend on
the detailed mechanism of the nonlinearity. We have considered two physically dif-
ferent models in which the nonlinearities are caused by two diﬀerent mechanisms:
either they are due to redistribution of populations between Zeeman sublevels (op-
tical pumping), or are due to the coherence established between the sublevels. Both
models gave very similar results and reproduced our experimental observations. The
very distinct result of the competition between absorption and rotation, i.e. the
maximum of the forward scattering amplitude signal, appears at well determined
value of the atomic density. We believe that existence of such characteristic point
whose position is well deﬁned function of the atomic properties of the medium and
scattered light intensity should allow precise determination of the atomic number
densities or transition probabilities.

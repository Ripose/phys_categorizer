Abstract:

We study the perspectives of nanowire-based metamaterials for negative-refraction waveg-

uides, high-performance polarizers, and polarization-sensitive biosensors. We demonstrate

that the behavior of these composites is strongly inﬂuenced by the concentration, distribu-

tion, and geometry of the nanowires . We derive analytical description of electromagnetism

in anisotropic nanowire-based metamaterials and show that it is possible to use nanowire

systems to achieve an extreme anisotropy of the dielectric constant required for high energy-

density waveguides and non-magnetic negative index systems. Finally, we study the limita-

tions of our analytical results via 3D numerical solutions of Maxwell equations.

The anisotropy of eﬀective dielectric permittivity is widely used in optical, IR, THz and

GHz sensing, spectroscopy, and microscopy[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Strongly anisotropic optical

materials can be utilized in non-magnetic non-resonant optical media with negative index

of refraction, and have a potential to perform planar imaging with subwavelength resolution

and to compress the free-space radiation to subwavelength areas[4, 7, 8, 9]. The performance

of these polarization-sensitive applications can be related to the relative diﬀerence of the

dielectric constant along the diﬀerent directions.

In the majority of natural anisotropic

crystals this parameter is below 30% [10]. While it may be suﬃcient for some applications,

a number of exciting phenomena ranging from high-performance polarization control[6] to

subwavelength light guiding[4, 7, 8] to planar imaging[9] require diﬀerent components of a

permittivity tensor to be of diﬀerent signs.

In this Letter we study the perspectives of using nanowire composites as meta-materials

with extreme optical anisotropy. We demonstrate that even 10% stretching/compression

of the nanowire structures may dramatically aﬀect the electromagnetic properties of these

systems and change the sign of the components of permittivity tensor. We present analytical

description of wave propagation in anisotropic nanowire composites – Generalized Maxwell-

Garnett approach (GMG), and verify it via 3D numerical simulations.

The use of metallic wire mesh as anisotropic low-frequency plasma with negative dielec-

tric permittivity has been proposed in[11, 12] and experimentally realized for normal light

incidence in[6, 13]. However, the applicability of these nanowire-based materials for any

non-trivial geometry involving oblique light incidence or wave-guiding is still considered to

be questionable due to strong nonlocal interactions[14, 15], that may potentially result in

positive components of the permittivity tensor. Furthermore, existing analytical techniques

are limited to the optical response of nanowires homogeneously distributed in isotropic host

and are not applicable for practical composites where the geometry is anisotropic due to

fabrication process or as a result of material compression/stretching[16]. Understanding the

electromagnetism of nanowire structures in the optical domain is the main purpose of this

Letter.

The geometry of the nanowire composites considered in this work is shown in Fig.1. The

nanowires with permittivity ǫin are embedded into a host material with permittivity ǫout.

The nanowires are aligned along the z direction of Cartesian coordinate system. We as-

sume that the nanowires have elliptic crossections with the semi-axes rx and ry directed

3

along x and y coordinate axes respectively. We further denote typical separations between

the nanowires x and y directions to be lx and ly.

In this work we focus on the case of

“homogeneous metamaterial”, when the inhomogeneity scale is smaller than the wavelength

(rα, lα ≪ λ) and nanowire concentration N is small so that the lattice feedback eﬀects can be

treated using perturbative techniques as described below. Under these conditions, Maxwell

equations have free-space-like solutions that can be represented as a series of plane electro-

magnetic waves propagating inside a material with some eﬀective dielectric permittivity[17]

ǫeﬀ:

< Dα >= ǫeﬀ

αβ< Eβ >.

(1)

The angular brackets in Eq.(1) denote the average over microscopically large (multi-wire),

macroscopically small (subwavelength) region of the space, with Greek indices corresponding

to Cartesian components, and assumed summation over the repeated indices. If both ǫin

and ǫout are isotropic, the normal axes of the tensor of eﬀective dielectric permittivity will

coincide with the coordinate axes. Thus, in the selected geometry the permittivity tensor

becomes diagonal: ǫeﬀ

αβ = δαβǫeﬀ

ββ with δαβ being the Kronecker delta function.

We now derive the expressions for the components of the eﬀective permittivity ǫeﬀ

xx, ǫeﬀ
yy

and ǫeﬀ

zz . Using the continuity of the Ez component, Eq.(1) yields:

ǫeﬀ
zz = Nǫin + (1 − N)ǫout.

(2)

Note that the single parameter that determines the z component of the permittivity in the

eﬀective medium regime is nanowire concentration N.

To ﬁnd the in-plane (x, y) components of the permittivity tensor we use the Maxwell-

Garnett (MG) technique[18, 19, 20]. In this approach the nanowire concentration is consid-

ered to be small and therefore the local ﬁeld in the composite is considered to be homoge-

neous across a nanowire. Consequently, the ﬁeld inside the nanowire Ein is also homogeneous

and related to the local excitation ﬁeld Eex via

Ein;α =

ǫex
(1 − nα)ǫout + nαǫin

Eex;α,

with {nx, ny} = {ry/(rx + ry), rx/(rx + ry)} being the depolarization factors[17, 20], deter-

mined solely by the nanowire crossection. Combination of Eqs.(1,3) yields the following

expression for the in-plane components of permittivity:

with Eout being the average ﬁeld between the nanowires as described below. As seen

from Eq.(4), the eﬀective-medium response of the nanowire composite is determined by

(i) nanowire crossection[20] and (ii) average concentration of the nanowires N[18, 19]. The

crucial point of this work is that the eﬀective medium properties are also strongly inﬂuenced

by the nanowire distribution (given by the parameters lx, ly), that aﬀect both Ein and Eout.

show crossections of composites for N = 0.35. The breakdown of GMG occurs at high nanowire

concentrations, when the local ﬁeld becomes inhomogeneous on the scale of rα

To calculate this eﬀect of distribution anisotropy on the permittivity tensor, we consider

a microscopically large, macroscopically small region of the composite subjected to the

incident ﬁeld E0.

In the limit N ≪ 1 considered here, the excitation ﬁeld acting on a

nanowire in the sample Eex will contain the major contribution from external ﬁeld E0 and

the feedback ﬁeld scattered by all other nanowires in the structure ˆχE0. Such a feedback

5

ﬁeld will in turn contribute to the excitation ﬁeld in the system, and will consequently result

in the secondary excitation ˆχ2E0. Direct summation of these series yields the equilibrium
state Eex;α = [δαβ − χαβ]−1E0;β. For rectangular, triangular, and other highly-symmetrical

lattices, as well as for a wide-class of random nanowire micro-arrangements, the feedback

tensor becomes diagonal[21], so that

Eex;α =

ﬁelds yields

(7)

with the shape vector {γr;x, γr;y} = {rx/ry, ry/rx}.

To study the limitations of the developed GMG technique, we numerically solve 3D

Maxwell equations with COMSOL Multiphysics 3.2 and compare the results of these simu-

lations to our analytical approach. Two types of numerical simulations are performed. In the

ﬁrst set of numerical experiments, we study the quasi-static response of the nanowire mate-

rials. Fig.1 shows the excellent agreement between the direct solution of Maxwell equations

and GMG approach presented in this work for concentrations N . 0.3 and deformations

|γr;α − 1|, |γl;α − 1| . 0.3. Our numerical simulations indicate that the quasi-static material

properties are fully described by average parameters (N, lα, rα), and are almost unaﬀected by

local nanowire arrangements. This particular property of the eﬀective-medium composites

indicates high tolerance of anisotropic metamaterials to possible fabrication defects.

6

Note that even 10% anisotropy in inclusion shape or distribution may dramatically aﬀect

material properties and result in change of sign of dielectric permittivity. Such an eﬀect opens

the possibility to create optical materials with widely controlled optical-mechanical proper-

ties, potentially leading to new classes of polarizers, beam shapers, etc. We also note that

anisotropic nanowire composites may be used for high-performance polarization-sensitive

sensing and ﬂuorescence studies, as well as for a wide class of ultra-compact waveguides[7, 8]

since the material properties may be tuned between ǫ ≈ 0 and |ǫ| ≫ 1.

existence of negative refraction mode, predicted in [9]; (b) modal propagation constant for λ =

1.5µm as a function of waveguide size; perfectly conducting waveguide walls are assumed[9]; lines

correspond to modes in waveguides with homogeneous dielectric cores with ǫeﬀ given by Eqs.(2,4),

symbols correspond to numerical solutions of 3D Maxwell equations in nanowire composites. The

breakdown of GMG correspond to |kαlα| ∼ 1

To clarify the eﬀects related to nonlocal material response we simulated the x-direction

wave propagation through a planar waveguide with composite core consisting of 10% Ag

nanowires in Si host. In Fig.2 we compare the results of these simulations to the dynamics of

TE and TM modes propagating in a waveguide with homogeneous anisotropic core, described

by

with ω = 2π/λ and kx, c, d being the modal wavevector, speed of light in the vacuum and

waveguide thickness respectively. It is clearly seen that GMG technique adequately describes

the response of nanowire systems when |kαlα| ≪ 1. We also found that in eﬀective-medium

7

regime |kαlα| ≪ 1 the material properties are independent of local nanowire arrangements

(type of crystalline lattice), while the exact point of EMT breakup (|kαlα|max) depends on

local geometry and is maximized for almost-rectangular lattices [assumed in derivation of

Eq.(6)]. In general, the spatial dispersion leads to cut-oﬀ of the modes, similar to what has

been predicted for GHz wire systems [14] and nanolayer-based photonic funnels[8].

Fig.2 also conﬁrms the feasibility of fabrication nanowire-based non-magnetic low-loss

planar waveguides with negative refraction index for sub-diﬀraction far-ﬁeld planar imaging

proposed in [9].

In conclusion, we have developed the eﬀective-medium theory (GMG) that adequately

describes the optical properties of nanowire composites with anisotropic crossections and

arrangements. Limitations of the proposed approach have been studied via numerical mod-

eling. We demonstrated that the nanowire composites can be used to achieve extreme

anisotropy at optical and IR frequencies, with controlled eﬀective permittivity ranging from

ǫ ≪ −1 to ǫ ≈ 0 to ǫ ≫ 1 – thus leading to practical implementations of high-energy-density

waveguides[7, 8], novel polarization-sensitive detectors, and recently proposed non-magnetic

negative index systems[9]. Finally, we note that the presented here technique can be readily

applied to dielectric, plasmonic, and polar-wire composites at optical, IR, and THz frequen-

cies, and can be further extended to the cases of non-alligned inclusions, anisotropic ǫin and

ǫout, and 3D composites similar to what have been done for isotropic-arrangement cases

in[19, 20].

Based on the Wigner distribution approach, an analysis of the eﬀect of partial incoherence on
the transverse instability of soliton structures in nonlinear Kerr media is presented. It is explicitly
shown, that for a Lorentzian incoherence spectrum the partial incoherence gives rise to a damping
which counteracts, and tends to suppress, the transverse instability growth. However, the general
picture is more complicated and it is shown that the eﬀect of the partial incoherence depends
crucially on the form of the incoherence spectrum. In fact, for spectra with ﬁnite rms-width, the
partial incoherence may even increase both the growth rate and the range of unstable, transverse
wave numbers.

INTRODUCTION

Nonlinear phenomena like self-focusing, collapse, mod-
ulational and transverse instabilities of cylindrical light
beams are some of the most fundamental consequences
of the interplay between linear diﬀraction and self-phase
modulation in nonlinear Kerr media. Various physical
mechanisms, which tend to suppress such instabilities
e. g. nonlinear saturation, have been diligently analyzed
in a number of works, see references in [1]. These fun-
damental instability problems have continued to attract
attention in connection with new scientiﬁc and techni-
cal developments. There is currently a strong interest
focused on the eﬀects of partial incoherence on diﬀerent
nonlinear instabilities [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The results of these
studies show that the modulational and collapse instabil-
ities tend to be suppressed when the waves are partially
incoherent. Recently, the eﬀect of partial incoherence on
the transverse modulational instability of soliton stripes
in nonlinear Kerr media has been investigated, see [2, 3].
A soliton stripe is a semi-localized structure, which is of
self-trapped soliton form in the x direction, uniform in
the y direction and propagates in the z direction. While a
1D soliton is resilient to perturbations, the soliton stripe
exhibits instability with respect to transverse perturba-
tions, i. e. perturbations in the y direction, see e. g. [7]. It
has been shown, [2, 3], that when the stripe is partially in-
coherent in the y direction, the transverse modulational
instability tends to be suppressed and the break-up of
the stripe, due to the transverse modulational instabil-
ity, can be prevented provided the incoherence is suﬃ-
ciently strong. This behavior is similar to that of the 1D
modulational instability. However, analysis of the trans-
verse modulational instability is more complicated than
the corresponding analysis in the case of 1D modulational
instability. In fact, even in the fully coherent problem,
the problem of ﬁnding the growth rate as a function of
the wave number of the perturbations does not have an

explicit analytical solution, cf [7].
In the present work we present an analytical investiga-
tion of the eﬀect of partial incoherence on the transverse
instability of soliton structures in nonlinear Kerr media.
It will be shown that in the case of a Lorentzian incoher-
ence proﬁle, the growth rate of the transverse instability
can be expressed simply as the growth rate for the co-
herent case minus a stabilizing damping rate due to the
partial incoherence. However, we also show that the case
of a Lorentzian proﬁle represents a very special case and
the eﬀect on the growth rate in a general case depends
crucially on the form of the incoherence spectrum [8].
Using a perturbation approach to the dispersion relation
for a general form of the incoherence spectrum, we show
analytically that for weak incoherence spectra of ﬁnite
rms-width, the region of instability always widens and
the growth rate is increased in some part of the region.
This result agrees well with a recent numerical study of
the transverse instability of partially incoherent solitons
[3], where the angular spectrum is assumed to have Gaus-
sian form.

II. THE WIGNER APPROACH

Our analysis is based on the Wigner approach, which
has been shown to be a convenient tool for analyz-
ing the dynamics of partially incoherent light waves, cf
[1, 4, 5, 6].
The starting point of the analysis is the nonlinear
Schr¨odinger (NLS) equation for the complex wave ﬁeld,
ψ(r, z), describing the two dimensional propagation of
a partially coherent wave in a diﬀractive nonlinear Kerr
medium,

to depend only on the statistically averaged intensity i. e.
. This form of the NLS equation is valid when

the medium response time is much larger than the char-
acteristic time of the stochastic intensity ﬂuctuations and
yet much shorter than the characteristic time of the wave
envelope variation.
Within the Wigner approach, Eq.(1) is transformed into
the Wigner-Moyal equation for the corresponding Wigner
function ρ(r, p, z), viz

and used the notations G+ = G(py + k/2) + G(py
and G− = G(py + k/2)

The Wigner distribution is determined by the stochastic

is the average ﬁeld intensity. In the present application
we consider a background solution in the form of a soliton
stripe, i. e. a semi-localized structure, which constitutes
a self-trapped soliton form in the x direction, is uniform
in the y direction and propagates in the z direction. This
structure is assumed partially incoherent in the y direc-
tion. The corresponding intensity and the concomitant

we consider the dynamics of a small perturbation by writ-

III. THE CASE OF LORENTZIAN
INCOHERENCE SPECTRUM

For the development of our analysis it is useful to ﬁrst
reconsider the case of a fully coherent wave. The trans-
verse coherence spectrum is then a Dirac delta function
i. e. G(py) = δ(py). The earlier introduced notations G+
and G− now become a sum and a diﬀerence, respectively,
of two translated delta functions. The py dependence of
the U and V functions can be expressed in similar man-
k/2)]˜u(r, px) and
ner, i. e. U = [δ(py + k/2) + δ(py
k/2)]˜v(r, px). The combina-
V = [δ(py + k/2)
tions of delta functions now appearing in Eq.(8) can be
shown to be separable, and the resulting system of equa-
tions reduces to

lem (Γ = Γ(0, k)) cannot be found analytically, and re-
sort must be taken to approximate analytical techniques
and/or numerical computations, cf [9, 10]. As an exam-
ple, a derivation inspired by direct variational methods
is given in the Appendix.
With this result in mind for later comparison, we turn
back to the partially incoherent problem.
In the same
way as for the coherent case, we can eliminate the func-
tion V in Eq.(8) to obtain

ˆL2U + kpy(kpyU + G− n ˆCR0) =

ˆLG+ n ˆSR0.

notes its inverse. Since the py dependence in the opera-
tor ˆA−1 is multiplicative, some important simpliﬁcations
can be made. For instance, in the second integral of
Eq.(12), the ordering of the terms may be interchanged
as ˆA−1G− pyn ˆCR0 = G− py ˆA−1n ˆCR0. For the subse-
quent analysis we need the eigenvalue rather than the
operator itself since ˆA−1n ˆCR0 =

We will now assume the incoherence spectrum to have
a Lorentzian proﬁle, G(py) = p0/[π(p2

characteristic width p0. This assumption has the impor-
tant consequence that the integrals appearing in Eq.(12)
can be evaluated explicitly to yield:

A comparison of the two dispersion relations (the one
for the coherent, Eq.(10), and the one for the partially
incoherent, Eq.(15), case) shows that the only diﬀer-
ence between the two is the shift in the argument of the
ˆP operator; the argument ˆL is replaced by ( ˆL + kp0)
in the partially incoherent case. Equivalently, since
ˆL = Γ + px∂/∂x + 2N0 ˆS, this implies that Γ(0, k) =
Γ(p0, k) + kp0, where Γ(p0, k) denotes the growth rate
of the partially incoherent case. Thus we ﬁnally come
to the important conclusion that, for Lorentzian shaped
incoherence spectrum, the role of the partial incoherence
on the transverse modulational instability of a soliton
stripe can be expressed in exactly the same form as for
the 1D modulational case [6], viz simply as a stabilizing
damping according to

plies two things:
the instability is suppressed by the
incoherence for all wave numbers in the range [0, kc],
where the cut-oﬀ wave number, kc, is given by kc =
0 and secondly the range of instability decreases
monotonously with increasing incoherence. However,
p
this simple monotonously suppressing eﬀect of the partial
incoherence on the transverse modulational instability is
not of a general nature. An indication of this was found
in [3], where numerical investigations were made using
Gaussian as well as Lorentzian coherence spectra. Some-
what counter-intuitively it was found that for the case of
a Gaussian spectrum, increasing incoherence actually in-
creased the range of modulationally unstable wave num-
bers and increased the growth rate in part of the unstable
region. Only for suﬃciently strong incoherence did the
unstable wavelength range start to shrink and the growth
rate to decrease and to ultimately vanish. Thus, it seems
that the properties of the transverse modulational insta-
bility depend crucially on the form of the incoherence
spectrum. That this indeed is so will be shown analyti-
cally in the subsequent paragraph.

IV. RESULTS FOR A GENERAL
INCOHERENCE SPECTRUM

In general, a complete analytical solution of Eqs.(8)
seems impossible to ﬁnd. However, important informa-
tion about the properties of the solution can be obtained
by considering certain moments of the equations. For
this purpose, we integrate the coupled equations for U
and V over x and px. This yields

We underline that G− is determined by the coherence
properties of the soliton background solution, but that
the parameter Q may depend on the coherence spec-
trum. Nevertheless, the result expressed by Eq.(19) is
completely general and is valid for arbitrary form of the
coherence spectrum. We emphasize that Eq.(19) is of
the same form as the dispersion relation for the modu-
lational instability of a partially coherent, but homoge-
neous, background, cf [6, 8], in which case the parameter

Q is easily determined to be Q = 1. On the other hand,
for the transverse instability of a partially incoherent soli-
ton stripe, the proper value of Q can not be easily found,
although we may state that Q < 1. For the special case
of a Lorentzian spectrum studied above, we can take one
step further in Eq.(19) to obtain a dispersion relation

(Γ + kp0)2 = (2Q

where, however, the Q factor still remains to be deter-
mined. The analysis of the previous section and the result
3/4, independently
of the Appendix indicate that, Q
of the degree of incoherence i.e. independently of p0.
In order to pursue this line of analysis for general forms of
incoherence spectra, we will assume weak partial incoher-
ence in the sense that the incoherence spectrum is very
narrow i. e. p0
k. The integral of Eq.(19) may then
be evaluated approximately for any (well behaved) inco-
herence spectrum G(py). This implies that the function
F (py) = kpy/(Γ2 + k2p2

Since the incoherence is assumed weak, we will assume
that the dispersion relation given by Eq.(21) may be sim-

From this approximate expression for the growth rate, we
can draw two important conclusions, valid for arbitrary
(but narrow) incoherence spectra with ﬁnite rms-width:
(i) the instability tends to be suppressed for all wave
numbers in the range 0 < k2
3Qc, whereas in the re-
gion 3Qc < k2 < 4Qc, the growth rate is enhanced by the
partial incoherence. (ii) the critical (non-zero) wave num-
ber, kc, at which the growth rate goes to zero, increases
and is given by k2
4(Qc + p2
rms. These
analytical results agree well with what was obtained by
Torres et al. [3] using numerical computations.

On the other hand, these results are in contradiction with
the results obtained in the previous section for the case
of a Lorentzian spectrum. There it was found that (i)
the growth rate decreased for all wave numbers, (ii) the
cut oﬀ wave number, kc, monotonously decreased with
increasing incoherence. The explanation of this appar-
ent contradiction is that the analysis of this section ex-
cludes spectra, which, like the Lorentzian, do not have
a ﬁnite rms-width. A direct implication of this result is
that the eﬀect of partial incoherence depends crucially
on the form of the incoherence spectrum, even to the ex-
tent that in some wavelength range the instability may
even be enhanced by the incoherence. As demonstrated
in [3], for increasing incoherence, the range of unstable
wave numbers ﬁrst increases, but then eventually shrinks
until ﬁnally the instability is completely quenched. This
complete behavior is outside the range of validity of the
perturbation analysis presented in the current section.

V. CONCLUSION

The present analysis has, in some detail, considered
the eﬀect of partial incoherence on the transverse mod-
ulational instability of soliton stripes. We have shown
that, for a Lorentzian form of the incoherence spectrum,
the eﬀect of partial incoherence on the transverse insta-
bility agrees qualitatively with the corresponding result
derived for the case of 1D modulational instability; the
growth rate decreases monotonously for increasing par-
tial incoherence. However, the Lorentzian form is a very
special case in the sense that although it has the nice
property of being analytically integrable, it does not have
a ﬁnite rms-width. Our analysis of general spectra with
ﬁnite rms-widths shows quite a diﬀerent qualitative be-
havior of the growth rate for weak increasing incoherence.
The growth rate is found to decrease for transverse wave
numbers in the range 0 < k < k∗, but to increase in the
complementary range k∗ < k < kc, where kc is the cut
oﬀ wave number of the instability and k∗ is a characteris-
tic transition wave number. In addition, it is found that
kc does in fact increase. These analytical results agree
well with numerical simulations performed by [3] as well
as with previous analytical work of ours for the simpler
case of the 1D modulational instability, [8].

APPENDIX

The dispersion relation for the transverse modulational
instability cannot be determined analytically even in the
coherent case and several diﬀerent approximations have
been presented, cf [9, 10, 11]. We will here give a sim-
ple, accurate and as far as we know new, approximation
using a direct variational approach. Linearization of the
2D coherent NLS equation, given in Eq.(1), around the
stationary solution ψ = sech x exp(iz/2) gives rise to two
coupled equations for the real u(x), and imaginary v(x),

parts of the perturbed wave ﬁeld. Inserting the assumed
variations in y and z for the modulational perturbations
(i. e. u, v

exp(iky + Γz)), these equations become:

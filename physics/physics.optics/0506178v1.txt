Abstract

The theoretical work of V.B. Braginsky predicted that radiation pressure can couple the mechan-

ical, mirror-eigenmodes of a Fabry-P´erot resonator to it’s optical modes, leading to a parametric

oscillation instability. This regime is characterized by regenerative mechanical oscillation of the

mechanical mirror eigenmodes. We have recently observed the excitation of mechanical modes in

an ultra-high-Q optical microcavity. Here, we present a detailed experimental analysis of this eﬀect

and demonstrate that radiation pressure is the excitation mechanism of the observed mechanical

oscillations.

The work of V.B. Braginsky[1, 2] predicted that pressure induced by circulating radi-

ation in a Fabry-P´erot resonator can couple the optical modes to the mechanical mirror

eigenmodes. The coupling can lead to a parametric oscillation instability, characterized by

regenerative oscillation of the mechanical mirror eigen-modes. This mechanism has been

studied theoretically for its possible role in setting a detection sensitivity limit in the laser

interferometer gravitational wave observatory (LIGO) [3, 4], but has so far not been observed

experimentally.

Recently, we have observed a nonlinear mechanism[5]

in ultra-high-Q toroid

microcavities[6] that is distinct from other nonlinear mechanisms already observed in these

structures[7, 8]. The geometry for observation of this nonlinearity is a standard one in which

a wave (here referred to as the pump) is coupled from a waveguide to a microcavity mode.

The nonlinearity manifests itself as oscillations in the pump power transmitted past the

micro-cavity. These oscillations are observed to occur at a distinct threshold pump power

level and have spectral components at characteristic frequencies. Numerical modeling and

spectral analysis reported in Ref. [5] revealed that the observed oscillations are due to regen-

erative oscillation of certain mechanical eigenmodes of the toroid microcavity. In this letter,

we demonstrate that the observed mechanical oscillations are caused by radiation pressure,

and speciﬁcally rule out another mechanism (thermal eﬀects[9] ). As such, this work con-

ﬁrms the ﬁrst observation of radiation-pressure-induced parametric oscillation instability as

predicted by Braginsky.

The theoretical treatment of Braginsky [1] considered mechanical oscillations of Fabry-

P´erot mirror eigenmodes which leads to Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands (at frequencies,
ω0±
Stokes ﬁeld coincides with an adjacent optical cavity mode the phenomenon of parametric

ωm where ω0 is the optical and ωm the mechanical frequency). It was shown[1] that if the

oscillation instability can occur. In contrast to the Braginsky theory, we observed mechanical

oscillations of several mechanical modes (above a certain threshold) when the mechanical

resonance frequencies (ωm) produce Stokes and anti-Stokes ﬁelds that fall within the same
cavity resonance (i.e. ωm < ω0
Q )[5]. For Q-factors in the range of 106-108 this corresponds to
frequencies in the range of ca. 1-100 MHz which coincides with the range of the ﬁrst three

fundamental mechanical modes of the toroid microcavities employed in this work. Fig. 1a

shows the ﬁrst, three mechanical modes of a toroid microcavity and Fig. 1b their frequency

dependence on cavity length. Note that the mechanical motion causes modulation of the

2

optical pathlength of the toroid cavity modes, causing the excitation of optical sidebands.

These ﬁelds appear in the cavity transmission spectrum, as shown in Fig.1c.

To account for this scenario we have extended the coupled mode analysis of Braginsky

to the present case of Stokes and anti-Stokes frequency pairs falling within the same cavity

resonance (For simplicity only one pair is considered here).

In addition optical coupling

eﬀects associated with the waveguide-resonator junction are, by necessity, included in the

analysis. Using the rotating wave and the slowly varying envelope approximation for all

ﬁeld amplitudes, the mutual coupling of the pump (ap), Stokes (aS) anti-Stokes, (aAS) and

mechanical mode (xm), can be described by the following coupled-mode equations:

In this regime, minimum threshold can be shown to occur over-coupled (i.e.,

K > 1), where again the condition ωm < 1

τ is met (i.e. the mechanical oscillation frequency
is again less than the ”loaded” cavity bandwidth), which causes the minimum threshold

(i.e.,

∂2P
∂K∂∆ω = 0 [14]) to approach an asymptotic value. The transition to the HF regime,

under conditions of optimum threshold, occurs for an optical Q given by QHF

To conﬁrm these theoretical predictions the threshold dependence (as given by Eq. 2) on

both optical and mechanical Q-factor have been measured. The data presented are taken

using a single microtoroid device. Coupling to the resonator was performed using a ﬁber-

optic taper coupler (see inset ﬁg.2). The micro-toroid under consideration had principal,

pillar and minor diameters of 72, 36 and 6.8µm, respectively, and possessed mechanical

resonances frequencies at 4.4, 25.6 and 49.8 MHz for the ﬁrst three mechanical modes (n =

1, 2, 3 and m = 0). The optical pump wavelength was

1550 nm and mechanical oscillation

∼

instability was observed by detecting the characteristic oscillations in the transmitted pump

power (compare Fig. 1c) [5] using an electrical spectrum analyzer (ESA) as described in Ref

[5]. Optimization of coupling (K) was performed by adjustment of the gap between the ﬁber

4

taper and the microtoroid as described in refs.

[7, 8]. To measure the dependence of the

oscillation threshold on Qm, a silica microprobe was brought into contact with the interior

(disk region) of the toroid structure. Variation of the probe contact force thereby modiﬁed

mechanical Q while leaving the optical Q unaﬀected. The microprobe, which was made from

an optical ﬁber, had a tip diameter of

2 µm and can be seen in the inset of Fig. 2. In

the absence of probe contact Qm was measured to be

5000 for the n = 1 mode, and upon

progressive increase in tip pressure could be continuously decreased to Qm

50. Below

≈

threshold, the thermal displacement of the mechanical eigenmodes (the temperature being

∼

∼

300K) provides suﬃcient modulation to be optically detectable, causing the appearance of

Lorenzian peaks in the cavity transmission spectrum. Qm was then determined by ﬁtting

the transmission spectrum with a Lorenzian, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2. For each Qm,

the minimum threshold was measured for the n = 1 ﬂexural mode as shown in Fig. 2. The

solid line in the main panel shows that the data exhibit the 1/Qm dependence in agreement

with Eqn. 2, and Ref. [1].

We next measured the threshold dependence on the optical Q factor as shown in Fig. 3 for

both the n = 1 (main panel) and the n = 3 (inset) mechanical modes. The optical Q factor

was adjusted by exciting diﬀerent radial and transverse optical modes. For lower optical

Q, wherein the acoustical oscillation frequency falls within the cavity bandwidth, the rapid

1/Q3 dependence is observed for n = 1 as predicted. For higher optical Q, as theoretically

predicted a transition into the HF regime occurs at QHF
the theoretical prediction ( ω0
ωm

).

It is important to note that these observations rule out

107. This point agrees well with

thermal eﬀects [9] as origin of the observed oscillations[15]. In Fig. 3, the solid line is the
minimum threshold i.e. ( ∂2P

∂K∂∆ω = 0) as given by equation (2). With the exception of the
eﬀective mass, mef f , all parameters used to create this plot were experimentally measured
parameters (i.e., C(Γ), R, Qm, ωm, Q0, ω0). The eﬀective mass mef f was inferred to be m(1)

The inset of Fig. 3 shows the measured threshold versus Q for the n = 3 mode. The

n = 3 mode threshold dependence shows that this mode is already well into the HF regime,

exhibiting the theoretically predicted asymptotic behavior of the minimum threshold. This

fact is consistent with the observed resonance frequency, 49 MHz, for the n = 3 mode

which predicts that the HF regime occurs for optical Q factors in excess of 107 (QHF

0 =
106). Comparison with the n = 1 mode data shows that oscillation on the

n = 3 mode is preferred for lower optical Qs. Indeed, preference to the n = 3 mode was

possible by loading the microcavity into the over-coupled regime, in agreement with theory.

The solid curve in the inset gives the single-parameter ﬁt to the n = 3 data which yields
m(3)

10−11kg, which is a factor of 660 lower than the mass of the n = 1 mode.

As a further test of the validity of the theoretical model, the experimental eﬀective mass

which is in very good agreement with the experimental ﬁt. However, for the n = 1, 2 modes,

the calculated eﬀective mass is a strong function of the oﬀset of the toroidal ring with respect

to the equatorial plane of the disk[16]. To both validate and quantify this oﬀset, a cross

section of the toroid microcavity used in this study was obtained with focused ion beam

slicing. SEM imaging (cf. Fig. 4 panel A) reveals the presence of the above-postulated

equatorial oﬀset which amounts to ∆ = 1.3 µm .
numerical mass calculation yields m(1)

Incorporation of this oﬀset into the
10−9kg. This value

10−8kg and m(2)

agrees very well with the experimental values from above. Finally, the numerical model

ef f = 2

also explains why the n = 2 mode is only observed sub-threshold in the experiments. The

low mechanical Q value (

200) in conjunction with its high eﬀective mass and frequency,

∼

predicts threshold powers > 2 mW, which are higher than pump powers available in the

experiments.

In summary, presented is both an experimental and theoretical analysis of radiation

pressure induced parametric oscillation instability, as predicted by Braginsky. Excellent

agreement of the threshold functional dependence on optical Q is obtained, providing a

conﬁrmation that radiation pressure is the excitation mechanism of the observed oscilla-

tions. Besides the fundamental aspects of this work, the observed coupling of mechanical

and optical modes by radiation pressure can ﬁnd applications in micro- and nanomechanical

systems (MEMS/NEMS)[17] for ultra-high sensitivity measurements of charge [18], displace-

ment [19], mass, force[19] or biological entities [20]. Equally important, radiation pressure

as observed here can be used to achieve cooling of a mechanical resonator mode.

An unambiguous proof of lasing in an active nanocavity with ultrahigh spontaneous emission
coupling factor (β = 0.65) is presented. To distinguish the subtle lasing threshold features from
possible material-related phenomena, such as saturable absorption in the gain medium, a series of
active nanocavities with diﬀerent values of β have been designed to systematically approach the
high-β device. The demonstration of the lasing threshold is obtained through the observation of the
transition from thermal to coherent light photon statistics that is well understood and identiﬁed in
the β ≪ 1 lasing regime. The systematic investigation allows a more deﬁnitive validation of the
onset of lasing in these active nanocavities.

Advances in fabrication of optical nano-scale devices
enable the construction of nanolasers in which there is
eﬀectively only one optical emission mode. The β fac-
tor is a measure inversely proportional to the number of
available modes in which the gain medium can sponta-
neously emit photons. Achieving a high β factor is a key
issue for improving single-photon sources [1, 2, 3].
In
addition, high β values enable low-threshold lasers with
high modulation speeds [4] and low intensity noise [5].
Various semiconductor laser systems have demonstrated
high β values of order of 0.1 [6, 7, 8, 9], and in partic-
ular, recent achievements in quantum dot nanocavities
have demonstrated close-to-perfect coupling eﬃciencies
[10, 11, 12, 13]. For such devices with β approaching
unity, the lasing threshold is harder to determine and
shifts to very low optical pump and output powers (the
hypothetical case of a β = 1 is often referred to as a
thresholdless laser [4]). The characteristic nonlinearities
in the optical output power and the emission linewidth
around the lasing threshold become so subtle that one
might wonder whether other eﬀects such as saturable ab-
sorption in the optical gain medium could be responsi-
ble for the observed features [14]. The question of what
constitutes a laser becomes even more intricate if an un-
conventional gain medium, e.g. consisting of a very low
density of optically active quantum dots, is considered.

In this Letter, we provide validation of the existence
of a lasing threshold in a β factor of nearly unity laser
that is independent of the precise gain mechanism and
the (nonlinear) absorption characteristics of the mate-
rial. The validation is based on the design and fabrica-
tion of a series of nanocavities that support dominantly,
one, two and three optical modes overlapping with the
gain medium. This stepwise decreases the β factor from
approximately 1 to 0.5 to 0.33 (in our experiments from
0.65 to 0.35 to 0.15) and brings the observed transition
features into the regime where they are unambiguously

identiﬁed as the lasing threshold. As the deﬁning signa-
ture of the lasing threshold, we use the transition from
the thermal light source to the coherent light source as
measured by the second-order intensity correlation func-
tion:

where E(+)(t) and E(−)(t) are the positive and negative
frequency parts of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, respectively
[15]. The measurement of g(2)(τ ) reveals a fundamental
diﬀerence between a laser, i.e. g(2)(τ ) = 1, and thermal
light, i.e. g(2)(0) = 2 [16]. The interpretation of the
observed-laser-photon statistics [17, 18] led to the quan-
tum theory on coherent-state transitions [19, 20].

We consider nanocavities with a gain medium com-

prised of a low density (
tum dots (QDs) grown by a partially covered island tech-
nique [21]. Nanocavities were designed to support one,
two, and three modes in the s-shell region of QDs, and
hence to reveal the eﬀect of β on laser photon statistics
systematically. Nanocavities utilize the triangular-lattice
photonic-crystal (PC) structures with three, seven, and
eleven missing holes in the Γ-K direction, denoted as
L3, L7, and L11 cavities, respectively. The conditions
for cavity resonances are determined by the PC waveg-
uide dispersion and the Fabry-Perot condition [22]. FIG.

PC waveguide and the resonant modes of L7 and L11

photodiodes (APDs) in the Hanbury-Brown Twiss conﬁg-
uration. The QD PC nanolasers were optically pumped
by a power and temperature stabilized 780 nm diode
laser. FIG. 1(b) shows the µ-PL spectra of L3, L7, and
L11 cavities with one, two, and three modes, respectively.
All the modes are polarized in the Y direction with no
degeneracy. Provided that these nanocavity modes are
decorated by the broad QD gain spectrum [13], the max-
imum β is 1 for L3, 0.5 for L7, and 0.33 for L11 cavities.

To explore the lasing behavior of the QD PC nanocav-
ities, we can inspect a typical output characteristics of
an L3 laser, plotted as a function of the incident pump
power as shown in FIG. 2(a). The output starts to grow
nonlinearly, and then increases in a nearly linear manner
before being clamped at values of incident pump powers
above 20 µW. The dependence of g(2)(0) on the incident
pump power is compared with the output characteristics
in FIG. 2(a). g(2)(0) increases with incident power from
0.2 µW to 0.6 µW, subsequently converging to one be-
fore the output emission is clamped. FIG. 2(b) is the
g(2)(τ ) plot taken at 0.6 µW, which shows the largest
bunching peak for the L3 laser. This maximum bunch-
ing plot for the L3 structure can be compared with the

2(c) and 2(d). Note that there are systematic variations
in the peak value of g(2)(τ ), the width of the bunching
peak, and the signal to noise of the curves. These vari-
ations are the natural outcome of the diﬀerent values of
β, determined by the number of allowed cavity modes
in the diﬀerent structures, as we will show below. One
immediate question raised by the data of FIG. 2(a) is
the decrease of g(2)(0) below threshold, as it should be
super-Poissonian with g(2)(0) = 2 [16].

To gain further understanding into this discrepancy,
we sought insight through calibration measurements of a
more conventional GaAlAs MQW laser that also serves
as the pump source for our QD PC nanolasers. The laser
displays a clear threshold current of 36.25 mA as shown
in FIG. 3(a). Below threshold, the MQW gain spectrum
decorates about 100 cavity modes with a mode spacing of
0.13 nm. To discriminate side modes in the photon cor-
relation measurements, we replaced the 0.5 nm bandpass
ﬁlters by a monochromator with a bandwidth as narrow
as the lasing mode linewidth. Pronounced bunching sig-
nals in g(2)(τ ) were observed in the narrow current region
Ith. The bunching height, i.e.

where p0 is the zero photon probability and can be de-
termined by normalization, n is the number of photons
in the cavity, and Na and Nb are the number of carri-
ers in the upper and the lower levels, respectively. T1 is
deﬁned by T1 = (Λ0 + γ′)−1, where Λ0 is the pumping
rate and γ′ is the sum of all recombination rates that do
not add a photon to the cavity mode. R is deﬁned by
R = 4g2T1T2, where g is the coupling parameter between
the cavity mode and the excitonic transitions of carriers,
and T2 is the dephasing time. κ is the cavity decay rate
given by κ = 2πν/Q, where ν is the frequency of the cav-
ity mode. The normalized zero-ﬁeld populations of the
upper and lower laser levels are given by Na = N Λ0T1
and Nb = N γ′T1, where N is the total number of carriers
that correspond to gain saturation.

To investigate the eﬀect of β on the laser photon statis-

tics, we adopted the phenomenological expression [24],

which is simply the ratio of the spontaneous emission rate
into the cavity mode to the total recombination rate. We
used β and N as ﬁtting parameters to best describe the
observed g(2)(0)
1 behavior with the increase of the
pump power. Here, N rather than the number of QDs
was introduced as a ﬁtting parameter to account for the
non-resonant optical pumping scheme. In contrast to the
resonant optical excitation of QD energy levels, photo-
generated carriers in the GaAs bulk region relax to the
wetting layer (WL) and to QDs. In this process, the eﬃ-
cient coupling between the rich WL density of states and
QDs is believed to be fast enough to repopulate QDs con-
tributing to lasing action [13]. For the QD PC nanolasers
at 4 K, γ′ can be obtained by 2π/τP L according to the
µ-PL decay time (τP L
5 ns) measured for a QD uncou-
pled to the cavity mode. The theoretical analysis was
unaﬀected by taking T2 in the range of 0.1 ns to 1 ns
[2, 25]. For the GaAlAs MQW laser at the room temper-
ature, we can use the typical parameters of γ′ of 1.0 GHz
107 [23]. Other parameters
and T2 of 0.1 ps and N of 5
used in calculation are summarized in Table I.

Based on this analysis, the theoretical g(2)(0) curves
were obtained as shown in FIG. 4. The change of g(2)(0)
at the vicinity of Ith in the MQW laser agrees with the
theoretical curve indicated by a solid line, which was ob-
tained with β of 0.0001 and typical parameters shown
in Table I. Furthermore, the theoretical curve below
threshold shows the expected behavior of g(2)(0) = 2.

the increase of operating current as shown in FIG. 3(b).
The observed behaviors of g(2)(0) and ∆τ over thresh-
old are expected as the emission becomes more coher-
ent. But, the absolute value of g(2)(0) below threshold
is naively expected to obtain the value of 2 that does
not match the data. This can be explained by taking
into account the limited temporal resolution of 450 ps of
our setup. When the coherence time of the light source
becomes comparable to the temporal resolution of the
measurement system, then the g(2)(τ ) below threshold,
which is normally given by g(2)(τ ) = 1 + exp[
/τc],

must be convolved with a measurement function M (t, σ)
= (σ√2π)−1exp[
t2/2σ2], where σ is the APD timing
jitter. FIG. 3(c) shows the ideal and simulated g(2)(τ )
functions for τc = 2 ns and σ = 450 ps. The simulation
shows that g(2)(0) is reduced by 0.3, in good agreement
Ith. We
with the experimental data taken at 0.986
examined the eﬀect of M (τ, σ) for various values of τc
from 0.1 ns to 2 ns, and the results are plotted with the
experimental data in FIG. 3(d), showing excellent agree-
ment. The calibration measurements underscore the im-
portance of adequate timing resolution for sources with
short coherence times. These measurements also demon-
strate that the genuine signature of lasing action is the
convergence of g(2)(0) to one above threshold.

tain the dotted line, which is in good agreement with
the experimental data. The theoretical curves for QD
PC nanolasers are summarized in FIG. 4(b). The sys-
tematic variation of the g(2)(0) values can be seen with
the expected β values of 0.65
0.05, and
±
0.15
0.025 for the L3, L7, and L11 cavities, respec-
tively. Here, the ﬁts have been made to best describe
the transition of g(2)(0) with the increase of the pump
power, even if the initial bunching behaviors are yet to
be clariﬁed with better temporal resolution and detection
eﬃciency. But, both the experimental and theoretical
results demonstrate slow coherent-state transitions [26],
distinguishing high-β QD PC nanolasers from the con-
ventional MQW laser. The theoretical g(2)(0) curves be-
low threshold show saturation behaviors that decrease as
β increases, which is expected as β approaches unity and
coherence is observed for all input pump powers. This
can be explained by the fact that high-β devices have a
signiﬁcant contribution from spontaneous emission into

4

the lasing mode even at very low pump powers, which
destroys a thermal ﬁeld description with g(2)(0) = 2.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the systematic
correlation between the coherent-state transition and the
lasing action in QD PC nanocavities. The onsets of co-
herence in soft-turn-on nanolasers are conﬁrmed by the
convergence to Poissonian statistics, i.e. g(2)(0) = 1, with
the increase of the pump power. The bunching behav-
ior near threshold is found to subside with the increase
of β. The quantitative analysis reveals the very high β
of 0.65, 0.35, and 0.15, as predicted for the L3, L7, and
L11 cavities, respectively. This general approach of con-
structing a series of nano devices with the limiting case
as the device of interest, might prove useful to identify
other features in nano devices that can be diﬃcult to
distinguish from material properties.

Abstract: We built and characterized an optical system that emulates
the optical characteristics of an 8m-class telescope like the Very Large
Telescope. The system contains rotating glass phase-screens to generate
realistic atmosphere-like optical turbulence, as needed for testing multi-
conjugate adaptive optics systems. In this paper we present an investigation
of the statistical properties of two phase-screens etched on glass-plate
surfaces, obtained from Silios Technologies. Those etched screens are
highly transmissive (above 85%) from 0.45 to 2.5m m. From direct imaging,
their Fried parameter r0 values (0.43±0.04 mm and 0.81±0.03 mm, respec-
tively, at 0.633m m) agree with the expectation to within 10%. This is also
conﬁrmed by a comparison of measured and expected Zernike coefﬁcient
those screens are quite reproducible,
variances. Overall, we ﬁnd that
allowing sub-millimetre r0 values, which were difﬁcult to achieve in the
past. We conclude that the telescope emulator and phase-screens form a
powerful atmospheric turbulence generator allowing systematic testing of
different kinds of AO instrumentation.

Introduction

The optical image quality and in particular the angular resolution of ground based telescopes is
hampered by the refractive index variations of the Earth’s atmosphere. These refractive index
variations show a temporal and spatial behavior that under certain assumptions is well described
by Kolmogorov turbulence [1, 2, 3].

Adaptive optics (AO) instrumentation, available on almost all 8–10m-class telescopes, can
compensate for optical turbulence (seeing) with certain restrictions. One of these restrictions is
the isoplanatic angle, which is a result of using a single reference star for the AO and there-
fore compensating the integral effect of atmospheric turbulence in one direction only. Multi-
conjugate AO systems that compensate the dominant turbulent layers instead, can increase the
isoplanatic angle from a few tens of arcseconds [4] to up to a few arcminutes at 2.2 m m [5].

With the advent of second generation AO systems like multi-conjugate AO [6], ground layer
AO [7], extreme AO [8], multiple ﬁeld of view AO [9], and multiple object AO [10], it is
becoming more and more important to have a realistic 3D turbulence simulation tool available
in the laboratory. Such a tool provides repeatable optical turbulence and therefore well deﬁned
atmospheric conditions. It can support the assembly, integration, and veriﬁcation phase of novel
AO instrumentation such that AO performance can be veriﬁed before the instrument is attached
to the telescope.

In our previous papers [11, 12] we described the design, manufacturing process, and lab-

oratory characterization of ion-exchange phase-screens. While such phase-screen technology
allows repeatable optical turbulence generation over a wide spectral range, 0.5–2.5m m, it does
not allow sub-millimetre r0 values. In this paper we focus on a new type of phase-screen, based
on transmissive glass substrates with aberrations imprinted on one surface. The motivation
for investigating this new technique is this: For laboratory characterization of astronomical
adaptive optics systems designed for D=8–40-m-class telescopes, D/r0 values greater 30 are
required. As we can only use scaled-down telescope optics in a laboratory, with typical values
of Dlab=10 mm, we need r0 values smaller than Dlab/30=1/3 mm. Glass phase screens with such
small r0 values were in the past difﬁcult to fabricate. We identiﬁed the surface etching technique
as the only tool and therefore best solution so far to this problem.

In the following, we ﬁrstly describe in Sec. 2 the design of MAPS, an optical set-up used
to test the screens. The design and manufacture of the screens is then outlined in Sec. 3. Our
analyses and results are presented in Sec. 4, and we brieﬂy summarize our ﬁndings in Sec. 5.

2. MAPS, the multi atmospheric phase-screens and stars instrument for the visible and

near-infrared

MAPS is a laboratory tool that allows simulation of 3D atmospheric optical turbulence over
a wide ﬁeld of view up to 2 arcminutes. It consists of 3 main components. A plate for light
sources, comprising 34 ﬁber connectors [13] to investigate wide ﬁeld wavefront reconstruc-
tion for various artiﬁcial-star conﬁgurations. The second main part of the MAPS design [11]
consists of two optical tubes containing identical groups of lenses, fabricated by Janos Tech-
nology, Inc., Keene, NH, USA. The ﬁrst tube collimates the point sources of the reference plate
and creates the telescope pupil. The second tube refocuses the disturbed light beams into a 2
arcminute-wide focal plane with the optical characteristics of the Very Large Telescope (VLT)
f/15 Nasmyth focus. The third main component of MAPS is a set of phase-screens. Up to 3 glass
phase-screens can be mounted in between the two optical tubes. When rotating, those screens
emulate a turbulent atmosphere consisting of a ground or boundary layer, a mid-altitude layer,
and a high altitude layer. Each glass-plate can rotate with an adjustable and reproducible speed
to emulate different atmospheric wind speeds per layer (see also [12]). Additionally, we can ad-
just the position of each glass-plate along the optical axis of the system to emulate atmospheric
layers at different altitudes. Such a layered approach of atmospheric turbulence is supported by
a number of experimental studies [14, 15, 4, 16, 17, 18].

The glass-plate phase-screen design was kindly provided by ESO [19]. The telescope pupil
of MAPS is implemented through a 13 mm (equivalent to an 8-m telescope) pupil stop installed
immediately behind the ground layer phase-screen when viewed from the direction of the col-
limating lens assembly.

3. Fabricating the surface etched phase-screens

3.1. Phase-screen phase maps

The phase maps of the phase-screens manufactured for the MAPS assembly are shown in Fig. 1.
In the following the screens will be denoted as PS1 and PS2, with PS1 being the more turbulent
screen. PS1 is used as the ground layer screen in the ﬁnal MAPS assembly, while PS2 will
be used as the mid- or high-layer screen. The peak-to-valley differences of the phase maps
are 7.9 and 5.5m m, respectively. One pixel of the phase map corresponds to 0.1mm on the
manufactured screen.

Fig. 1. Phase maps of the ground layer phase-screen PS1 (left) and mid- to high-altitude
phase-screen PS2 (right).

3.2. Fused silica substrate

The glass-plate phase-screens from Silios Technologies, France, are manufactured with a wet
etch process based on hydrochloric acid. The equipment is similar to standard semiconductor
processing equipment used for 4-inch wafers. The phase pattern is etched into the 100 mm
diameter and 1.5 mm thick glass substrate consisting of fused silica (Corning code 7980) from
Corning Inc., USA. This high purity amorphous silicon dioxide has a very good transmission in
the required spectral range from 0.5–2.5 m m. As shown in Fig. 2 the transmission is >90% over
the entire spectral range with only two small H2O-absorption features at around 1.4 and 2.2 m m.
Visual inspection of the screens does not reveal any inhomogeneities or opaque patches. The
phase-screens are realized through a multilevel proﬁle created with either 5 (PS2) or 6 (PS1)
masks, which eventually lead to 25=32 and 26=64 different levels of the phase map.

Fig. 2. Transmission in % as a function of wavelength, measured for phase-screen PS2.

4. Characterization of glass-plate phase-screens from Silios Technologies

For the (statistical) characterization of the manufactured phase-screens we use two different ap-
proaches: ﬁrst, methods based on measurements of the point spread function (PSF), and second,
wavefront-based methods. The basic parameter we wanted to measure and compare to the theo-
retical expectation, is the well-known Fried parameter r0. An equally important quantity is the
slope of the turbulence power spectrum or the slope of the variance of the Zernike coefﬁcients
vs. mode number. Although these quantities could be readily derived in the case of the available
computer-generated template wavefronts used for the phase-screens, characterizing the power

spectrum of the manufactured screens requires an accurate measurement of the actual distorted
wavefront.

4.1. Point spread function (PSF) measurement

To measure the PSF we put a single phase-screen at the ground layer position in the MAPS
assembly, using a 13mm pupil-stop as the telescope aperture, which is equivalent to a real-
world aperture of 8m. A single-mode ﬁber at the center of the ﬁeld of view on the input side
of MAPS was used as light source. Measurements were performed at two wavelengths, using
a HeNe laser with l =632.8nm, and a diode laser with l =831.5nm. A standard CCD with a
pixel size of 6.9x6.9 m m2 was placed in the focal plane of the imaging side to record PSF
images. To capture short exposure PSFs, the phase-screen was rotated at a speed of typically
0.5 rpm, while the CCD acquired large sets of exposures (of the order of several thousand) with
integration times of a few milliseconds. Afterwards, all short exposure images were stacked
to generate the long exposure PSF image used for the coherence length (r0) measurement. In
Fig. 3 we show examples of short and long exposure PSFs for both phase-screens at the two
wavelengths. In order to derive values for r0 we additionally took images using pinholes of
different sizes as telescope aperture and recorded the resulting PSFs without a phase-screen in
the optical beam.

The FWHM of the PSF obtained without any turbulence – the diffraction limited PSF – is

then given by:

FW HMDL = 1.02 ·

· S,

l

D

(1)

where the subscript DL denotes the diffraction limited FWHM, and D is the diameter of the
pupil-stop deﬁning the telescope aperture. The factor S is the image scaling factor of our sys-
tem, containing both focal length and pixel size and determined with the calibration images.
Our calibration measurements are in agreement with the predicted l /D behavior within the
measurement errors. For the FWHM measured in radians and the telescope diameter given in
meters, S would be simply unity. Knowing the value for S we are able to compute the coher-
ence length r0 from the measured FWHM of our seeing limited long exposure PSFs (FWHMSL)

Before giving the actual results of these measurements, we ﬁrst describe how we derived r0
in the case of the computer-generated template wavefronts. In a ﬁrst step we reconstructed the
phase structure function described by

DF (x) =< [F (x′) − F (x′ + x)]2 > .

The resulting structure functions of both screens are shown in Fig. 4. It is well visible that
the structure function indeed ﬂattens out at larger values of x, clearly indicating a ﬁnite outer
scale L0. An outer scale of L0=22m – typical for the Paranal observatory – was assumed for
the design of the phase maps, and the measured ﬂattening of the phase structure function is
compatible with this value.

In a second step we used the phase structure function to compute the optical transfer function

(OTF) of the phase-screens using the equation

(4)

OT F(x) = exp[−0.5DF (x)].

Since the PSF is the inverse Fourier transform of the OTF we are able to directly compute the
long exposure PSFs of our phase-screen computer templates, and to compare them with our
experimental results for the manufactured screens. In Fig. 5 we show the theoretically expected
PSFs, scaled to the measurement wavelengths and the image scale of our set-up, together with

the radially averaged and normalized proﬁles of the PSFs measured from direct imaging. From
the FWHM of these proﬁles we derived the values given in Tbl. 1 for the coherence length r0.
With the exception of the infrared measurement for phase-screen 2, all measured values
are in very good agreement with the theoretically expected values. The use of two different
wavelengths also allows us to determine whether the wavelength dependence of r0 on the phase-
screen substrate differs substantially from that expected in the Earth’s atmosphere. Since the
coherence length r0 in the atmosphere scales as l 1.2, we can compare with the ratio of r0
determined at 632.8 and 831.5nm with that for the atmosphere (i.e. 0.72). All measurements
are in agreement with the theoretically expected value within one standard deviation.

Fig. 7. Zernike coefﬁcient variances of phase-screen PS1 at a wavelength of l = 632.8m m.
Measurements are based on Shack-Hartmann wavefront gradients obtained with the
300m m-lenslet array. The wavefronts of 100 randomly distributed test apertures with a
diameter of 10mm were reconstructed with a least-squares Zernike decomposition. The
plotted line (dashed) results from a ﬁt to the Zernike variances calculated for the computer
generated phase map under the assumption of a ﬁnite outer scale of L0=22m. Zernike mode
number 1 corresponds to the piston term and is omitted in the plot. A Zernike decomposi-
tion of the computer generated phase-screen with a 3 by 3 pixel binning corresponding to
a cell size of 300m m is shown for comparison.

frequency structure, except for the left panel (i.e. using the 133m m-array), which appears to
differ markedly. While it shows considerable ﬁne structure, it also appears to be somewhat ﬂat-
ter than the other pair of phase maps. This is not unexpected if we recall that on one hand the
Silios phase-screens have a square pixel-like structure, with each pixel, or cell, being (scell=)
100m m-wide. Yet, on the other hand, the Shack-Hartmann sensor only measures wavefront gra-
dients, and that the minimum size of each lenslet used needs to be > 2 · scell. It is therefore not
surprising that the 133m m-array appears to be relatively insensitive to the wavefront shape.

In a quantitative approach, we decomposed both the measured wavefronts and the computer-
generated phase maps into their Zernike representations and calculated the Zernike coefﬁcient
variances < |a j|2 >. In the case of the computer generated phase maps, the values were ﬁt-
ted accounting for a ﬁnite outer scale of L0=22m. The expected and measured Zernike vari-
ances are shown in Fig.7 and Fig.8, considering all three different microlens arrays. Indeed, the

Fig. 8. Left: same as Fig. 7, but for the 133m m-lenslet array. A Zernike decomposition
of the original computer-generated phase-screen (i.e. without additional pixel binning),
corresponding to a cell size of 100m m, is shown for comparison. Right: Also the same
as Fig. 7, but for the 480m m-lenslet array. A Zernike decomposition of the computer-
generated phase-screen with a 5 by 5 pixel binning, corresponding to a cell size of 500m m,
is shown for comparison.

ance estimated using the 133m m-array is considerably less than the expectation. As expected
however the 300m m-array allows a better match to the numerical simulation. The variance data
for the 480m m-array also provides a good match, except at Zernike indices above ∼20, where
there is increased scatter in < |a j|2 >, caused (at least in part) by the (relatively) small number
of sampling elements (lenslets) available for constraining the high spatial frequencies on the
phase-screen.

5. Conclusions

We have procured and characterized two phase-screens. We ﬁnd that, within uncertainties, the
statistical properties of both screens match those of the computer-generated templates. This
suggests that the surface-etching technique allows reproducible phase-screens. In comparison to
ion-exchange phase-screens [11] we conclude that phase-screens with small r0 values (strongest
optical turbulence) are more reliably produced with the etching technology. We want to note
that Shack-Hartmann wavefront measurements of phase-screens with a discrete pixel-like ﬁne
structure require a minimum Shack-Hartmann lenslet diameter; this diameter has to be at least
twice as large as the pixel size on the phase-screen.

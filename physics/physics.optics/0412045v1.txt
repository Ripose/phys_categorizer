Propagation of the main signal in a dispersive
Lorentz medium

Abstract

Evolution of the main signal in a Lorentz dispersive medium is
considered. The signal propagating in the medium is excited by a
sine-modulated pulse signal, with its envelope described by a hyper-
bolic tangent function. Both uniform and non-uniform asymptotic
representations for the signal are found. It is shown when the uniform
representation can be reduced to the non-uniform one. The results
obtained are illustrated with a numerical example.

1 Introduction

Investigations on propagation of pulse signals in dispersive media date back
to the beginning of 20th century. The fundamental research in this area is
due to Sommerfeld [1] and Brillouin [2, 3]. Although steady interest in this
kind of propagation was observed in the literature since then, a new impetus
has been added recently due to new applications of the theory in ﬁber-optics
communication and integrated-optics. Also, the knowledge of pulse propa-
gation in a dispersive medium, and of accompanying electromagnetic energy
losses in the medium, became of vital importance in radiotherapy. A signiﬁ-
cant contribution to the research on dispersion phenomena in Lorentz media
is due to Oughstun and Sherman [4]. Equipped with better computation
techniques and advanced asymptotic methods, they extended the analysis
to models more closely reﬂecting practical applications. In particular, they
considered signals with a ﬁnite rise time and employed uniform asymptotic
expansions in their analysis. (Uniform expansions remain valid as their pa-
rameters vary while non-uniform expansions break down at some parameters
values.)

Here, we also consider the evolution of the main signal excited in a Lorentz
dispersive medium by a signal with a ﬁnite rise time. However, unlike Ough-

1

stun and Sherman work, where the envelope of the initial signal is described
by an everywhere smooth function of time which tends to zero as time goes
to minus inﬁnity, our exciting signal is switched abruptly at a ﬁnite time
instant, and vanishes identically for earlier times. In the analysis carried out
in this paper we apply the Bleistein and Handelsman [10] theory of uniform
asymptotic evaluation of integrals with nearby saddle point and an algebraic
singularity. We show, how the uniform representation of the evolution of the
main signal reduces to the non-uniform representation, which can otherwise
be obtained by residues.

The results obtained here are illustrated with a numerical example.

2 Formulation of the problem

Consider the problem of an electromagnetic plane wave propagation in a
homogeneous, isotropic medium, whose dispersive properties are described by
the Lorentz model of resonance polarization. The complex index of refraction
in the medium is given by [4]

n(ω) =

1

 

−

ω2

.

−
Here, b2 = 4πNe2/m, where N, e and m represent the number of electrons
per unit volume, electron charge and its mass, respectively, δ is a damping
constant and ω0 is a characteristic frequency.

Let the signal A0(t) in the plane z = 0 be a sine wave of a ﬁxed real
frequency ωc with its envelope described by a real function u(t), identically
vanishing for t < 0, i.e.

A0(t) =

Then arbitrary component of the wave propagating in the direction of in-
creasing z (or of a corresponding Hertz vector) can be represented in the
medium by the scalar function [4]

which describes the dynamics of the signal excited at z = 0 by A0(t), and
propagating in the Lorentz dispersive medium in the direction of growing z.
The uniqueness of this solution is proved in Sec. 2 of [3] .

In this work we study the poles contribution to the asymptotic expansion
of A(z, t). We denote this contribution by Ac(z, t) and ﬁnd both non-uniform
and uniform asymptotic expressions for it.

3 Non-uniform asymptotic expression for

Ac(z, t)

In ﬁnding an asymptotic expansion of the integral deﬁned by (9) it is essen-
tial to determine the location of its critical points, including saddle points
and the poles in the complex ω-plane. The equation governing the location
of the saddle points does not seem to be solvable exactly. Instead, diﬀerent
approximate solutions were obtained by Brillouin [3], Kelbert and Sazonov
[6], and Oughstun and Sherman [4] to describe the location. Recently, a new
approximation for this location was obtained in [7]. In this work, however,
we shall employ a numerical approximation of the saddle point solution ob-
tained with the help of the Mathematica computer program, and based on
interpolation techniques.
As in Oughstun and Sherman study, we deform the original contour of inte-
gration to the Olver type contour P (θ) [8] which passes through the near and

3

distant saddle points. The pole contribution to the asymptotic expansion of
(9) occurs if in the process of contour deformation one or more poles of ˜uβ(ω)
are crossed. From the series representation of the function ˜uβ(ω) [5]

it follows that the integrand in (9) has an inﬁnite set of poles ω = ωc −
m = 0, 1, 2,
0, which are located along a line,
parallel to the ω imaginary axis. If β is big enough, only the real pole ω = ωc
is of importance, since the remaining poles are not crossed in the process of
contour deformation. If, however, β is small, one or more of the remaining
poles can be crossed, and their contributions must then be taken into account.
Let θs be the value of θ, at which the deformed contour crosses the pole
at ω = ωc in (9), ωc being real and positive. Then, by the Cauchy theorem,



It then follows that for real and positive ωc the pole contribution to the
asymptotic expansion of A(z, t) oscillates in time at the frequency ωc and
decreases along its propagation distance z with time independent attenuation
coeﬃcient α(ωc).

The pole contribution (14) represents a discontinuous function of θ, while
the integral representation of A(z, t) changes continuously with θ. As pointed
in [4], this fact is of little signiﬁcance if z is ﬁnite and the pole is bounded away
from the dominant saddle point at ω = ωs. Denote X(ω, θ) = Re φ(ω, θ).
Then e−(z/c)X(ωc,θ) is negligible in comparison to the saddle point contribution
which has the magnitude e−(z/c)X(ωs,θ). Hence, the discontinuous behaviour
of Ac(z, t) is then also negligible.

4 Uniform asymptotic expression for Ac(z, t)

The situation becomes diﬀerent if the dominant saddle point approaches the
pole at ω = ωc. In this case X(ωc, θ) is comparable with X(ωs, θ) and so
are the pole and the branch point contributions to the asymptotic expansion
of A(z, t). To obtain a continuous asymptotic representation for Ac(z, t), a
uniform approach, as proposed by Bleistein and Handelsman [10] will here
be used.

Let us consider the ﬁrst pole at ω = ωc. From (9) and (10) it follows that

the function to be asymptotically evaluated is

ωs = ωs(θ). (One can verify that the contour P (θ) through a near (distant)
saddle point ω = ωs makes the angle π/4 (3π/4) with the real axis.)

In accordance with the Bleistein and Handelsman method we introduce

resentation applies for any value of √λγ, the non-uniform representation is

One remark should now be made. The applied theory assumes that the
saddle point is of the ﬁrst order, i.e. φωω(ωs, θ) is never zero. In the present
context this assumption is satisﬁed everywhere except for the special value
of θ = θ1, where two coalescing near simple saddle points merge on the ω-
imaginary axis to form a saddle point of the second order. Hence φωω = 0
at θ = θ1, and consequently both asymptotic representations of Ac(z, t), as
given by (33) and (36), are there invalid. Therefore, strictly speaking, if the
carrier frequency ωc lies below anomalous dispersion region, (33) is a uniform
if θ > θ1.

suﬃciently distant from the contour P , and, in particular, it is not crossed
in the process of the contour deformation. Then only the real pole at ω = ωc
is of interest. Under this assumption the real and imaginary parts of γ(θ), as
given by (16), are shown in Fig. 1. In order to determine numerical values of
the function ωs(θ) an interpolation technique provided by the Mathematica
computer program has been employed. The evolution of the main signal,
as predicted by the uniform asymptotic representation (33), is depicted in

φωω, has been
dropped.

6 Conclusions

In this paper the problem of electromagnetic signal propagation in a disper-
sive Lorentz medium is considered. It is assumed that the exciting signal is
turned on at a ﬁnite time instant. The signal rapidly oscillates and its en-
velope is described by a hyperbolic tangent function. While propagating in
the medium, the signal splits into three components: Sommerfeld and Bril-
louin precursors, and the main signal. In this work we ﬁnd both non-uniform
and uniform asymptotic representations for the main signal evolution. The
former representation is readily obtainable by residues. The latter repre-
sentation is constructed with the help of Bleistein-Handelsman method of
uniform asymptotic evaluation of integrals with nearby simple saddle point
and an algebraic singularity. We show, how the uniform representation, ex-
pressed in terms of complementary error integral, reduces to the non-uniform
representation. The results here obtained are illustrated with a numerical ex-
ample. This paper is a complement to our earlier works on Sommerfeld and
Brillouin precursors ([12], [13]).

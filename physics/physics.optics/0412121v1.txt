Abstract. – We generalize the invariant imbedding theory of the wave propagation and
derive new invariant imbedding equations for the propagation of arbitrary number of coupled
waves of any kind in arbitrarily-inhomogeneous stratiﬁed media, where the wave equations are
eﬀectively one-dimensional. By doing this, we transform the original boundary value problem
of coupled second-order diﬀerential equations to an initial value problem of coupled ﬁrst-order
diﬀerential equations, which makes the numerical solution of the coupled wave equations much
easier. Using the invariant imbedding equations, we are able to calculate the matrix reﬂection
and transmission coeﬃcients and the wave amplitudes inside the inhomogeneous media exactly
and eﬃciently. We establish the validity and the usefulness of our results by applying them
to the propagation of circularly-polarized electromagnetic waves in one-dimensional photonic
crystals made of isotropic chiral media. We ﬁnd that there are three kinds of bandgaps in these
structures and clarify the nature of these bandgaps by exact calculations.

Introduction. – The phenomena of the coupling of two or more wave modes in inhomoge-
neous media and mode conversion between them are ubiquitous in various branches of science,
including plasma physics, optics, condensed matter physics and electrical engineering [1–6].
In this Letter, we develop a generalization of the powerful invariant imbedding method [6–13]
to the case of several coupled waves in stratiﬁed media. Starting from a very general wave
equation of a matrix form, we derive a new version of the invariant imbedding equations for
calculating the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients and the ﬁeld amplitudes. By doing
this, we transform the original boundary value problem of coupled second-order diﬀerential
equations to an initial value problem of coupled ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations. This makes
the numerical solution of the coupled wave equations much easier. Furthermore, our equations
have a great advantage that there is no singular coeﬃcient even in the cases where the material
parameters change discontinuously at the boundaries and inside the inhomogeneous medium.
We check the validity and the usefulness of our invariant imbedding equations by applying
them to the propagation of electromagnetic waves in stratiﬁed chiral media. By calculating

the matrix reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients exactly, we clarify the nature of the three
diﬀerent photonic bandgaps that can exist in photonic crystals made of chiral media.

Theory. – We consider a system of N coupled waves propagating in a stratiﬁed medium,
where all parameters may depend on only one spatial coordinate. We take this coordinate as
the z axis and assume the inhomogeneous medium of thickness L lies in 0
L. We also
assume that all N waves propagate in the xz plane. The x component of the wave vector, q,
is a constant and the dependence on x of all wave functions can be taken as being through a
factor eiqx. In a large class of interesting problems, the wave equation of N coupled waves in
the present situation has the form

of the probe and phase-conjugate waves in layered phase-conjugating media [14, 15]. A wide

These invariant imbedding equations are supplemented with the initial conditions, r(0) = 0

we solve the coupled nonlinear ordinary diﬀerential equations (9) and (10) numerically using
the initial conditions, and obtain the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcient matrices r and t
as functions of L. The invariant imbedding method can also be used in calculating the ﬁeld

Application. – Eqs. (9), (10) and (11), which have never been derived before to the
best of our knowledge, will be the starting point in our future analysis of a variety of wave
coupling and mode conversion phenomena. In the rest of this Letter, we establish the validity
and the utility of our invariant imbedding equations by applying them to the problem of the
electromagnetic wave propagation in stratiﬁed chiral media.

Isotropic chiral media are those where the appropriate constitutive relations are given by

The parameters ǫ, µ and γ are the dielectric permittivity, the magnetic permeability and the
chiral index respectively [17–19]. Some researchers use alternative constitutive relations [20,21]

D = ˜ǫE + iξB, H = B/µ + iξE.

The two relations give identical results if the parameters are identiﬁed by

(12)

(14)

We will use eq. (12) from now on. In recent years, there have been a large number of theoretical
[17, 19–24] and experimental [18, 25–28] studies on the wave propagation in various kinds of
chiral media.

From the Maxwell’s equations and the constitutive relations, we are able to derive the

wave equations satisﬁed by the electric ﬁeld in inhomogeneous chiral media:

In the uniform case, right- and left-circularly-polarized waves are eigenmodes of this equation
with the eﬀective refractive indices √ǫµ+γ and √ǫµ
γ respectively. In inhomogeneous media,
these two modes are no longer eigenmodes and are coupled to each other. The equation
satisﬁed by the magnetic ﬁeld H is similar except that the roles of ǫ and µ are reversed.
In media stratiﬁed in the z direction, ǫ, µ and γ are functions of z only. For plane waves
propagating in the xz-plane, the x dependence of all ﬁeld components is contained in the
factor eiqx. In this situation, we can eliminate Ex, Ez, Hx and Hz from eq. (15) and obtain
two coupled wave equations satisﬁed by Ey = Ey(z) and Hy = Hy(z), which turn out to have
precisely the same form as eq. (1) with

We have used eqs. (9), (10) and (16) in calculating the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃ-
cients in various situations. In all cases where exact solutions by other methods are available,
our theory gives the same results. In our notation, r11(r21) is the reﬂection coeﬃcient when
the incident wave is s-polarized and the reﬂected wave is s(p)-polarized. Similarly, r22(r12) is
the reﬂection coeﬃcient when the incident wave is p-polarized and the reﬂected wave is p(s)-
polarized. Similar deﬁnitions are applied to the transmission coeﬃcients. By a suitable linear
combination of these coeﬃcients, we are able to obtain a new set of the reﬂection and trans-
[19]. For instance, r++(r−+)
mission coeﬃcients rij and tij, where i and j are either + or
represents the reﬂection coeﬃcient when the incident wave is right-circularly-polarized and
the reﬂected wave is right(left)-circularly-polarized. The reﬂectances and transmittances are

As an example, we consider a uniform chiral layer of ﬁnite thickness with the parameters
ǫ, µ and γ, placed between uniform achiral media of inﬁnite thicknesses. In this case, the
electromagnetic wave equations can be solved analytically, following the methods used in
elementary quantum mechanics. Lekner has presented an exact analytical solution of this
problem [19](1).
In deﬁning the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients, rss, rsp, rps, rpp,
In order to compare his
tss, tsp, tps and tpp, Lekner uses diﬀerent conventions from ours.
solution with ours, we need to identify r11 = rss, r12 = rps, r21 =
rpp, t11 = tss,
rsp, r22 =
t12 = tps, t21 = tsp and t22 = tpp, if the magnetic permeability of the media outside the chiral
layer is equal to 1. Taking these into account, we have veriﬁed analytically that Lekner’s
expressions for the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients satisfy our invariant imbedding
equations exactly.

In ﬁg. 1, we plot the reﬂectances R++, R−− and R+− and the transmittances T++ and
T−−, when a wave is incident at θ = 45◦ on a one-dimensional photonic crystal made of
alternating chiral and dielectric layers of the same thicknesses Λ/2. It can be proved easily
that R12 = R21 and R+− = R−+. The chiral layer has the parameter values of ǫ = 4, µ = 1
and γ = 0.3 and the dielectric layer has ǫ = 2, µ = 1 and γ = 0. The total number of periods
is 50. The x component of the wave vector, q, is given by q = ω sin θ/c and the z component
of the vacuum wave vector matrix, P , is given by P = pI, where p = ω cos θ/c. Also plotted
is the imaginary part of the Bloch wave number κ for an inﬁnitely large photonic crystal.
This quantity was obtained using an exact analytical expression for the dispersion relation of
inﬁnitely large photonic crystals made of two diﬀerent kinds of alternating chiral layers, which
we have derived recently [29]. The frequency region where the imaginary part of κ is nonzero
corresponds to a photonic bandgap.

We ﬁnd an excellent agreement between the analytical result on the dispersion relation and
the reﬂectance and transmittance spectra. In general, there are three kinds of bandgaps, two
of which are so-called co-polarization bandgaps and one of which is called a cross-polarization
bandgap. Unlike in previous studies of this phenomenon [23, 24], our theory is free of any
approximation and provides exact band structures. For large values of γ and θ, these three
bandgaps can be well-separated, as demonstrated in ﬁg. 1, where we show the second group
of bandgaps. The R+− spectrum clearly displays a cross-polarization bandgap and the R++
and R−− spectra show co-polarization bandgaps. The transmittance spectra show that a
right(left)-circularly-polarized wave, the frequency of which lies in the co-polarization bandgap
of left(right)-circularly-polarized waves, is freely transmitted.

It is straightforward to apply our method to more general situations where the parameters
ǫ, µ and γ are arbitrary functions of z. For example, we can easily study the eﬀects of defects
and randomness on the wave propagation in chiral media using eqs. (9), (10), (11) and (16).
Our equations can also be applied to the cases where both ǫ and µ take negative values with
no modiﬁcation. A detailed study of this so-called negative refractive index medium [30],
which is also chiral, is of great interest and will be presented elsewhere. We have also applied
our method successfully to a number of other coupled wave problems, such as the phase-
conjugate reﬂection of light from nonlinear phase-conjugating media, the light propagation in
uniaxial and biaxial media and the mode conversion phenomena in both unmagnetized and
magnetized plasmas [31]. In these studies, we solve the full wave equations exactly, without
using common approximations such as the slowly varying envolope approximation and the
WKB approximation. These results will be presented in a near future.

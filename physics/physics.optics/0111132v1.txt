The vertical radiation force on an absorbing micrometer-sized dielectric sphere situated in an
evanescent ﬁeld is calculated, using electromagnetic wave theory. The present work is a continuation
of an earlier paper [E. Almaas and I. Brevik, J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 12, 2429 (1995)], in which both the
horizontal and the vertical radiation forces were calculated with the constraint that the sphere was
nonabsorbing. Whereas the horizontal force can be well accounted for within this constraint, there
is no possibility to describe the repulsiveness of the vertical force, so distinctly demonstrated in the
Kawata-Sugiura experiment [Opt. Lett. 17, 772 (1992)], unless a departure from the theory of pure
nondispersive dielectrics is made in some way. Introduction of absorption, i.e. a complex refractive
index, is one natural way of generalizing the previous theory. We work out general expressions for
the vertical force for this case and illustrate the calculations by numerical computations. It turns out
that, when applied to the Kawata-Sugiura case, the repulsive radiation force caused by absorption
is not strong enough to account for the actual lifting of the polystyrene latex or glass spheres.
The physical reason for the experimental outcome is, in this case, most probably the presence of
surfactants making the surface of the spheres partially conducting.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The outcome of the Kawata-Sugiura levitation exper-
iment from 1992 [1] is in some ways still surprising. The
authors examined the radiation force on a micrometer-
sized spherical dielectric particle in the evanescent ﬁeld
produced by a laser beam of moderate power, P = 150
mW. As one would expect, the particle moved along the
horizontal plate at a speed of a few micrometers per sec-
ond, as a result of the tunneled photons in the evanescent
ﬁeld. The surprising point is, however: why does the par-
ticle lift from the surface? As reported in Ref. [1], “the
particle is forced to ﬂoat from the substrate surface and
to slide along the surface.” For a nonmagnetic and non-
absorbing dielectric particle, it is well known that the
electromagnetic volume force density f is

(1)

f = −

E2∇ǫ,

ǫ being the permittivity such that f = 0 in the homoge-
neous and isotropic interior, and diﬀerent from zero only
in the particle’s boundary layer. The evanescent ﬁeld is
known to vary as exp[−β(x + h)] in the vertical direction
(see Eq. (10) below), and is signiﬁcant only very close to
the substrate. In practice, this ﬁeld interacts with those
parts of the particle that are situated closest to the sub-
strate, and it gives rise to a surface force that, according
to Eq. (1), has to act in the downward direction (assum-
ing that ǫ > ǫ0). It is simply impossible to account for

†Electronic address: sivertst@oslo.geco-prakla.slb.com

a lift force on the particle, using Eq. (1). This discrep-
ancy between electromagnetic theory for dielectrics and
the Kawata-Sugiura experiment [1] is therefore, as men-
tioned above, somewhat surprising at ﬁrst sight, since
Eq. (1) has generally been proven to be invaluable in a
multitude of cases in electromagnetism and optics.

Consequently, we have to conclude that the explana-
tion for the observed lift of the particle has to lie in the
presence of an additional force, diﬀerent from the one
given by Eq. (1). The following two possibilities come to
mind:

(1) The particle has a complex permittivity ǫ, and is
therefore exposed to a repulsive (or positive lift) force
caused by the absorption of radiation in the interior.

(2) For some unspeciﬁed reason – e.g. a layer of ad-
sorbed ﬁlm on the particle’s surface – it may be appro-
priate to regard the surface as conducting. This allows
for an analysis of the problem in terms of a multiple scat-
tering formalism. Adopting such a picture, the vertical
force on the particle necessarily has to be repulsive; the
photons are bouncing oﬀ the spherical surface and are,
accordingly, transferring an impulse in the upward direc-
tion.

In the present paper, we will be studying option (1)
above, thus allowing for a complex ǫ, which in turn im-
plies a nonvanishing conductivity σ in the interior of the
particle. As far as we know, such a study has not previ-
ously been undertaken. This study is a continuation of
the work of Almaas and Brevik [2], dealing with the case
of a pure dielectric (real ǫ). Whereas the analysis in [2]
gave satisfactory results for the horizontal radiation force
observed in the Kawata-Sugiura experiment, it was im-
possible, as mentioned above, on the basis of Eq. (1) to
account for an upward directed vertical force. From now

indices in the transparent media 1 and 2 are respectively n1
and n2.

on, we will assume that the particle is a sphere of radius
a, and regard the conductivity σ as an input parameter.
Before embarking on the mathematical formalism, let
us also comment on option (2).
Lester and Nieto-
Vesperinas [3] recently analyzed the problem using mul-
tiple scattering methods, and were able to account for a
positive lift force. An advantage of this kind of method is
that the proximity of the sphere-substrate two-body sys-
tem is addressed explicitly. In contrast, our formalism is
built on the model of scattering of an evanescent wave
by an isolated sphere, and is therefore not expected to
be very accurate for small separations between the sphere
and the substrate. It is necessary to point out that the
adoption of a multiple scattering method does not in it-
self imply that the lift force is positive, as long as the
material in the sphere is a pure dielectric. Regardless of
whether the electromagnetic boundary conditions at the
surface of the substrate are taken into account or not, for
a pure dielectric, the force on the sphere is given by Eq.
(1), and, as we have argued above, is necessarily down-
ward directed. To account for a positive lift force, we
must allow for deviations from the simple theory of pure
dielectrics, meaning that absorption, and consequently
conductivity, are important eﬀects in the theory, explic-
itly or implicitly.

In the next section, we summarize the wave theoretical
formalism describing the interaction between the evanes-
cent ﬁeld and the sphere. In Section 3, we show how the
surface force Fsurf – i.e. the part of the total radiation
force F which is associated with the boundary and in-
dependent of the absorptive properties in the interior –
can be written as a double sum over complex expansion
coeﬃcients. Section 4, the main section of our paper,
contains the calculation of the absorptive part Fabs of
the radiation force. The results are illustrated in Figs. 2
- 5. Our calculations incorporate both the two polariza-
tion states of the incident beam (p and s polarization).
Our main analytical result is given in Eq. (61), for
the nondimensional vertical absorptive force component
Qabs
x . As one would expect physically, the result becomes
proportional to the conductivity σ. For the polystyrene

2

x

latex spheres, or glass spheres, used in the Kawata-
Sugiura experiment, the values of σ are very low. Hence,
it turns out that Qabs
becomes too weak to account for
the ﬂoating of the sphere in the gravitational ﬁeld. Now,
our formalism has, of course, a much wider scope than the
Kawata-Sugiura experiment. In optics, there are numer-
ous cases where radiation forces interact with absorbing
media. For instance, the current development of micro-
electromagnetical systems, which are used in a variety of
applications including even measurements of the Casimir
force, accentuates the usefulness of the present theory.

II. BASIC FORMALISM

A sketch of the geometry is shown in Fig.

1: A
laser beam is incident from below through a transparent
medium, called medium 1, and hits the plane, horizontal
surface towards the transparent medium 2 at an angle
of incidence, θ1, which is greater than the critical angle,
θcrit = arcsin(n2/n1), for total reﬂection. This estab-
lishes an evanescent ﬁeld above the plane surface, which,
in turn, is regarded as the incident ﬁeld falling upon a
compact sphere of radius a and complex refractive index
¯n3. The sphere is centered at the origin with the x axis
pointing vertically upwards. If ¯ǫ3 is the complex permit-
tivity of the (nonmagnetic) sphere, it is related to the
conductivity, σ, through the equation

¯ǫ3 = ǫ3 + iσ/ω,

(2)

p

hence ¯n3 =
¯ǫ3/ǫ0. We will assume that the incoming
beam in medium 1 is a plane wave, such that its elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁeld amplitudes are related through
ǫ0/µ0 E0. We introduce the nondimensional
H0 =
wave number, α, in medium 2, and the relative radial
coordinate ˜r:

p

α = k2a = n2ωa/c,

˜r = r/a,

and make use of the standard spherical coordinates
(r, θ, ϕ) centered at the origin of the sphere. Expansions
for the incident electric ﬁeld E(i) = (E(i)
θ , E(i)
ϕ ), the
scattered ﬁeld E(s) = (E(s)
θ , E(s)
ϕ ), and the inter-
, E(w)
nal ﬁeld in the sphere, E(w) = (E(w)
ϕ ), are
for convenience collected in Appendix A together with
the analogous expansions of the magnetic ﬁeld. In these
expressions, we have imposed the electromagnetic bound-
ary conditions at the spherical surface, r = a. We will
need use of the Riccati-Bessel functions ψl and ξ(1)

Here, jl and hl are the spherical Bessel and Hankel func-

are three groups of expansion coeﬃcients: {Alm, Blm}
for the incident ﬁeld, {alm, blm} for the scattered ﬁeld,

3

and {clm, dlm} for the internal ﬁeld. As for the ﬁrst-
mentioned coeﬃcients, they are determined by inverting

where dΩ = sin θ dθ dϕ. Here, the angular integrations
are taken over a sphere of arbitrary radius b. This free-
dom of choice for b gives us a calculational advantage.
The results for Alm and Blm are only related to the inci-
dent ﬁeld, and they have to be independent of b. Calcu-
lational insensitivity with respect to various input values
for b thus serves as a check of the evaluations of Alm and
Blm. In the following, we will suppress the writing of the
time factors exp(−iωt).

Our expansion procedure follows the conventions of
Barton et. al [4, 5]. This procedure was also followed
in Ref. [2]. In the case where b is chosen equal to a, Eqs.
(5) and (6) agree with Eqs. (A.23) and (A.24) of Ref. [5].

We shall not dwell much on these expressions, since our
main interest, as mentioned above, is the vertical force
F abs
associated with the absorption. Consider, however,
x
the horizontal surface force component F surf
. With an
incident beam power (in vacuum) of P = 150 mW, dis-
tributed over a circular cross-sectional area of diameter
10 µm, we ﬁnd the magnitude of the Poynting vector
0 = 19.0 M W/m2. Taking the radius of
to be (c/2)ǫ0E2

z

the sphere a = 1 µm, we ﬁnd the denominator in Eq.
(24) to be ǫ0E2
0 a2 = 0.13 pN. If the sphere is made
of glass (n3 = 1.50) and the surrounding medium 2 is
water (n2 = 1.33), we then have α = 2πa/λ2 = 7.9,
since the wavelength in water for Nd:YAG laser light is
λ2 = 1.06/1.33 = 0.80 µm. Using Fig. 5 in Ref. [2], we
ﬁnd that F surf
is positive, as it should be, and is approx-
imately equal to 0.010 pN in the case of p polarization.

z

Since the Reynolds number is very low, the Stokes drag
formula D = 6πµav is applicable, using µ = 1.0×10−3 Pa
s as the dynamic viscosity of water. Putting F surf
z = D,
we obtain the drift velocity of the sphere to be v = 0.53 µ
m/s. This is an order of magnitude agreement with the
observations of Kawata and Sugiura [1]; from their Fig.
4, one infers that v ∼ 1 − 2 µ m. We consider this agree-
ment to be satisfactory, and think that there is no real
need to carry out a complicated calculation to ﬁnd the
absorptive correction to the horizontal radiation force. In
the following, we will therefore focus our attention solely
on the vertical absorptive part of the force.

IV. THE VERTICAL ABSORPTIVE FORCE

To calculate the absorptive force, we ﬁrst replace Eq.

(1) by the general expression

f = ρE + J × B −

E2∇ǫ,

(25)

1
2

where ρ and J are the external charge and current den-
sities in the medium. Assuming that no external charges
are present, ρ = 0. Writing J = σE with σ as the con-
stant conductivity, we get, in complex representation, the
following expression for the absorptive force:

Fabs =

J × B∗dV =

E × H∗ dV,

(26)

ℜ

Z

σµ0

ℜ

Z

where the integral is evaluated over the volume of the
sphere.

Exploiting the following property, we can simplify our
calculation: In cases of current interest, the conductivity,
σ, of the material in the sphere is a small quantity. There-
fore, when evaluating the lowest order contribution from
absorption, we may replace the ﬁelds inside the sphere by
those calculated when assuming the material to be a per-
fect dielectric. That is, we replace the complex refractive
index ¯n3 by its real part n3. This facilitates the calcu-
lation of the volume integrals. The expressions for the
internal ﬁelds are given by Eqs. (A.13)–(A.18), in spheri-
cal coordinates. For notational convenience, we will omit
the superscripts (w).

V. RESULTS

A. Numerics

We implemented an adaptive Gauss-Kronrod rule to
calculate the integrals in Eqs. (18) – (20) and (38) –
(53). By employing the symmetry properties of the inte-
grals over the Legendre polynomials (Eqs. (54) – (58)),
we were able to greatly reduce the number of integrals to
be computed. To make sure that the sum over l and j in
Eq. (34) converged properly for our chosen cut-oﬀ value,
we plotted the total absorptive force on the sphere versus

set of refractive indices shown. The two states of polarization
for the incident beam are distinguished. Here, as well as in
the subsequent ﬁgures, θ1 = 51◦. Also, all ﬁgures refer to
sphere resting on the plate, i.e. to h = a. The ﬁgure is scaled
against the conductivity σ of the sphere.

increasing cut-oﬀ, lmax, in l (we used the same cut-oﬀ for
l and j). In Fig. 2, we give an example for p polarization
using several values of α. The total force is normalized
to the lmax = 30 result; all other parameters are given
in the ﬁgure caption. This ﬁgure clearly suggests that,
for a given value of α, there is a narrow range in l which
accounts for most of the absorptive force. Moreover, it
is seen that this range of important l-values moves to
higher l and broadens with increasing α. In the inset, we
plot on a linear-log scale the absolute value of the dif-
ference in the total force using l and (l − 1) respectively,
as cut-oﬀs. The inset indicates that contributions to the
absorptive force from large l-values (large with respect
to the l-value of the peak) are exponentially suppressed.
Hence, for the range of values for α, n1, n2, and n3 stud-
ied in this article, we need only consider contributions to
the force from l ≤ 30.

It is of interest to point out that the main features
of Fig. 2 can be understood from a physical point of
view. (This kind of argument is frequently made use of
in connection with Casimir-related calculations; cf.
for
instance, Ref. [11]). The most signiﬁcant angular mo-
menta are those that are of the same order of magnitude
as, or are somewhat smaller than, the angular momen-
tum corresponding to grazing incidence on the sphere.
Consider now a photon with energy ~ω and momentum
~k2 that just touches the surface of the sphere. Its angu-
lar momentum is ~k2a. Setting the angular momentum
equal to ~l, we thus obtain l = k2a = α. Thus, the most
signiﬁcant values of l should be expected to be l . α.
This is seen to be in accordance with the calculated re-

the agreement is actually better than we had reason to
expect.

B. Discussion of the ﬁgures

Illustrative examples of the behavior of the nondimen-
sional vertical absorptive force are shown in Figs. 3 – 5.
The angle of incidence is θ1 = 51◦ everywhere. In the
case of p polarization, E0 = E(1)
k , whereas for s polariza-
tion, E0 = E(1)
⊥ . When the incident ﬁeld is taken to be a
plane wave, the amplitudes E(1)
⊥ are constants.
It is to be kept in mind that, in order to lift the sphere
from the plate, the positive absorptive force has to over-
come not only gravity, but also the negative surface force
F surf
that was calculated in Ref. [2] for the same values
x
of {n1, n2, n3} as we consider here. The cases treated in
the two papers are thus directly comparable.

and E(1)

k

Similarly to Ref. [2], all curves in Figs. 3 – 5 refer to
the case of contact between sphere and plate, i.e.
to
h = a. From Eqs. (15) and (16), it is seen that Alm and
Blm contain exp(−βh) as a common factor. The same
property is carried over to the coeﬃcients clm and dlm,
according to Eqs. (A.21) and (A.22). As the absorptive
force is quadratic in the last-mentioned coeﬃcients, it
follows that Qabs
at an arbitrary height h is equal to
exp[−2β(h− a)] times the value that can be read oﬀ from
Figs. 3 – 5. No ﬁgures need to be worked out to show
the dependence of the force with height above the plate.
In order to interpret the ﬁgures physically, it is helpful
to consider a concrete example. Let us relate our discus-
sion essentially to the situation considered in Section 3:
incident plane wave of power P = 150 mW, correspond-
ing to ǫ0E2
0 a2 = 0.13 pN when the radius of the sphere is

x

a = 1 µm. If the density of the sphere is 2.4 g/cm3 (the
same density as for glass), the weight of it is mg = 0.10
pN. Moreover, n3=1.50, n2= 1.33 (water), whereas the
size parameter is α = 7.9 for Nd:YAG laser light. Let
us look for the necessary value of σ in order to satisfy
the condition for elevation of the sphere, just above the
plate. The condition is F abs
|. Expressed
nondimensionally,

x = mg + |F surf

x

Qabs

x =

mg
ǫ0E2

0 a2 + |Qsurf

x

|.

(62)

From Fig. 3 we read oﬀ, when choosing for deﬁniteness
x /(10−4σ) = 1.7, whereas
the case of p polarization, Qabs
from Fig. 4 in [2] we read oﬀ Qsurf
x = −0.35 for the same
value of α. This leads to a relatively high value of σ,
about 6600 S/m (S≡ Ω−1). In our example, the inﬂuence
of the weight of the sphere is relatively large because the
incident power is so moderate. If we increase P to 1 watt,
0 a2 = 0.87 pN, resulting in a somewhat lower
we get ǫ0E2
value, σ ≈ 2700 S/m.

For glass, σ ≈ 10−12 S/m. We can thus immediately
conclude that absorption is not the physical reason for
the elevation of the sphere in the Kawata-Sugiura ex-
periment. It is likely that there were surfactants on the
spheres in this experiment, and hence, that a theoretical
description of the kind given in Ref. [3] is most appropri-
ate in this case. For other materials where the conduc-
tivities are higher, for instance for carbon (σ = 0.77×105
S/m), the absorption-generated elevation of microspheres
should be quite possible physically. One must however
be aware of the algebraic restriction made in the present
paper to simplify calculations: our calculation relied on
the property that σ/ǫ0ω ≪ 1 (cf. Eq. (2)). This restric-
tion made it possible to take the refractive index n3 to
be real, inside the integrals in Section 4. Since ǫ0ω ≈ 105

S/m, we can no longer expect high accuracy from the
formalism when σ ≫ 104 S/m.

Consider ﬁnally the remaining ﬁgures: Fig. 4 shows
that when the refractive index in the sphere increases
from 1.50 to 1.60, the absorptive force increases. This is
as we would expect. Moreover, if the diﬀerence between
interior and exterior indices increases, the Riccati-Bessel
functions cause the force to become more oscillatory in
character. The changes are clearly shown, if we com-
pare Fig. 3 with Fig. 5. Increasing diﬀerences between
the refractive indices eﬀectively mean enhancing the the
geometrical-optics properties of the system. There is also
a dependence of the force upon the two diﬀerent polariza-
tion states of the beam. No simple physical explanation
of this dependence seems to exist.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We can summarize as follows:
1. The strategy of the above calculation has been to
identify the evanescent ﬁeld with the incident ﬁeld on
the sphere. The theory makes use of wave optics, and is
thus applicable even when the wavelength is of the same
magnitude as the sphere diameter.

2. The main novel development of the present paper
in comparison with Ref. [2] is the calculation in Section
4 of the vertical absorptive force, assuming the refractive
index ¯n3 in the sphere to be complex. The calculation
rests upon the approximation that σ/ǫ0ω ≪ 1, so that
the ﬁelds inside the sphere can be evaluated as if the
material were a perfect dielectric.

3. The results of Figs. 3 – 5 show that in order to
account for elevation of the micrometer-sphere, the con-

Incident ﬁeld

9

ductivity σ must be at least as large as about 103 S/m.
This applies, for instance, to media like carbon.

4. For latex or glass spheres, used in the Kawata-
Sugiura experiment [1], the absorptive force is too weak
to account for the elevation force. Most probably, the
observed elevation force was due to a ﬁlm on the surface
of the sphere, making it partly conducting. Cf. also Ref.
[3].

ﬁeld components. As mentioned in the main text, sub-
script 1 refers to the nonabsorbing substrate, subscript
2 to the nonabsorbing medium around the sphere (re-
fractive index n2), and subscript 3 to the absorbing
sphere whose complex refractive index is ¯n3. The rela-
tive refractive index is ¯n32 = ¯n3/n2. Furthermore, E0
and H0 refer to the incoming plane wave in the sub-
strate, the nondimensional wave number and distance is
α = k2a = n2ωa/c, and ˜r = r/a respectively.

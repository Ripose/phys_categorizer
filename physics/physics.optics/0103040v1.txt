the 6s 2S1/2 − 5d 2D3/2

We have measured the frequency of
electric-
quadrupole transition of 171Yb+ with a relative uncertainty of 1 × 10−14,
νY b = 688 358 979 309 312 Hz ± 6 Hz. A femtosecond frequency comb gen-
erator was used to phase-coherently link the optical frequency derived from a
single trapped ion to a cesium fountain controlled hydrogen maser. This mea-
surement is one of the most accurate measurements of optical frequencies ever
reported, and it represents a contribution to the development of optical clocks
based on an 171Yb+ ion standard.

Frequency comb generators based on Kerr-lens mode-

locked femtosecond lasers [1, 2] have dramatically sim-
pliﬁed absolute optical frequency measurements. Such
measurements of optical clock transitions in samples of
cold atoms or single trapped ions mark an important
step towards the realization of future optical clocks.
Several optical transition frequencies have already been
directly compared with primary cesium standards by
the femtosecond comb technique, such as the hydro-
gen Lyman-α transition [3], the 657 nm intercombi-
nation transition in Ca [4, 5], or a mercury ion tran-
sition at 282 nm [5]. Recently, the indium ion clock
transition at 237 nm was measured with respect to a
cesium-fountain calibrated He-Ne standard [6]. Here
we report the ﬁrst absolute frequency measurement
of the 6s 2S1/2(F = 0) − 5d 2D3/2(F = 2) transition of
171Yb+ at 435.5 nm (688 THz).

This transition is attractive for optical clocks due
to its small natural linewidth of 3.1 Hz and a ∆mF = 0
component with vanishing low-ﬁeld linear Zeeman fre-
quency shift. A single 171Yb+ ion is laser cooled in a
spherical radiofrequency Paul trap so that the Lamb-
Dicke condition is satisﬁed at 435.5 nm. The clock
transition is alternately probed on both sides of the
resonance line with the frequency-doubled output of an
extended-cavity diode laser emitting at 871.0 nm. One
laser cooling and probe excitation cycle lasts 80 ms.
The frequency of the probe laser is stabilized to the line
center with an eﬀective time constant of 30 s through
a second-order integrating servo algorithm. Short-time

ﬂuctuations are reduced by stabilization to an environ-
mentally isolated high-ﬁnesse cavity. More details are
given in Ref.
[7]. In the measurements reported here
the 171Yb+ clock transition was resolved with an es-
sentially Fourier-limited linewidth of 30 Hz.

A frequency comb was generated by a Kerr-lens
mode-locked femtosecond laser. The emitted periodic
pulse train corresponds in the frequency domain to a
comb-like spectrum, which can be completely charac-
terized by only three numbers: the line spacing equal to
the repetition rate frep, the longitudinal mode order m
of a line and an oﬀset frequency νceo, which reﬂects the
frequency oﬀset of the whole comb with respect to the
frequency origin. Thus, an external optical frequency
νext can be written

νext = νceo + mfrep + ∆x ,
(1)
where ∆x is the beat frequency of the external optical
signal with the mth comb mode.
In the experiment
the radiofrequencies νceo, frep, and ∆x are referenced
to a hydrogen maser, which in turn is compared with
a cesium fountain.

The experimental setup is schematically shown in
Fig. 1. The frequency comb generator comprises a
10 fs Kerr-lens mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser and a
microstructure ﬁber [8] for external broadening of the
spectrum via self-phase modulation. More details are
given in Ref.
[4]. By coupling approximately 30 mW
of the laser output into a 10 cm long piece of ﬁber we
achieved a spectrum ranging from 500 nm to 1200 nm.

Figure 1: Schematic of the setup. LBO denotes the LiB3O5–frequency doubling crystal, PD 1-3 photo detectors,
IF interference ﬁlter, and PLL phase-locked loop, respectively. Details are described in the text. Two additional
servo loops (not shown in the Figure) were used for a slow stabilization of frep and ∆x in order to keep the beat
signals within the hold-in range of the PLL tracking oscillators.

The 871 nm light from the 171Yb+ standard was
guided to the frequency comb generator via a 250 m
long single-mode polarization preserving ﬁber. About
1 mW of that light was combined with light from the
femtosecond laser. After spectral ﬁltering by a 10 nm
(FWHM) interference ﬁlter and spatial ﬁltering in a
short piece of single mode ﬁber the beat note ∆x was
detected with a fast Si PIN photodiode (PD 1), ﬁl-
tered by a phase-locked loop (PLL) and counted by a
totalizing counter.

Special care had to be taken for a phase-resolved
determination of the repetition rate frep, which, ac-
cording to eqn. (1), enters the optical frequency mea-
surement with a large multiplication factor m. Thus we
detected the 103rd harmonic of frep at 10 GHz with a
fast InGaAs PIN photodiode (PD 2) after spectral ﬁl-
tering with a fused-silica etalon. This microwave signal
was downconverted, ﬁltered and frequency-multiplied

by 288. Owing to the resulting large overall multi-
plication factor of 29 664 the digitization error was re-
duced below the instability of the hydrogen maser. The
wavelength of the 871 nm signal was pre-measured by
a lambdameter with absolute accuracy corresponding
to 1.5 MHz, thus determining the longitudinal mode
order m.

The frequency νceo was measured by detecting the
beat note between frequency-doubled comb modes around
1070 nm and modes around 535 nm. According to eqn.
(1) the frequencies of the comb modes are shifted by
νceo whereas the harmonics are shifted by 2νceo. The
resulting beat note νceo was detected by a photo mul-
tiplier (PD 3) after spatial and spectral ﬁltering both
ﬁelds with a single mode ﬁber and a 600 l/mm grating,
respectively. The signal was tracked with a third PLL
and ﬁnally counted.

Data were taken on three diﬀerent days. By averag-

2

ing we derive the following value for the 6s 2S1/2(F =
0) − 5d 2D3/2(F = 2) electric-quadrupole clock tran-
sition of the 171Yb+ ion:

νY b = 688 358 979 309 312 Hz ± 6 Hz .

This frequency includes the frequency shift of the
171Yb+ transition due to isotropic blackbody radiation
at an ambient temperature of 298 K. This shift is cal-
culated to − 0.4 Hz using tabulated atomic data [9].
Fig. 2 shows the Allan standard deviation of one day’s
data. The typical instability of the hydrogen maser
(open circles in Fig 2) is approached.

Figure 2: Allan standard deviation of the 171Yb+ clock
transition measurement and that of the typical perfo-
mance of the hydrogen maser. The inset shows the dis-
tribution of the measured frequency values (averaging
time 1 s, bin-width = 40 Hz, σ = 111 Hz). The Allan
standard deviation of the clock transition measurement
approaches the typical performance of the hydrogen
maser. The maser was operated in a self-tuning mode
which reduced the available frequency stability for av-
eraging times in the range of 200 s.

The combined 1σ uncertainty of 6 Hz is given by
the random and systematic contributions listed in Ta-
ble 1. Sources of systematic uncertainties are the ce-
sium fountain frequency standard [10] and the 171Yb+
frequency standard. The contributions due to ther-
mally and acoustically induced length ﬂuctuations both
of the coaxial cable carrying the 100 MHz hydrogen
maser signal and of the optical ﬁber guiding the 871 nm
light was measured to be below 1 × 10−15 and thus
are negligible. For the 171Yb+ frequency standard we
take into account a servo uncertainty of 1 Hz due to
probe laser frequency drifts which are in the range

of - 0.05 ± 0.03 Hz/s and a 3 Hz uncertainty due to
conﬁnement-related shifts of the atomic transition fre-
quency. The dominant source of these is the electric-
quadrupole interaction of the upper state of the clock
In
transition with stationary electric ﬁeld gradients.
order to avoid quadrupole shifts by the trap ﬁeld, the
applied trap voltage contained no dc component. The
residual shift due to uncompensated stray ﬁeld gra-
dients is estimated to be not larger than 0.1 Hz for
atomic D3/2 and D5/2 states [11]. An arrangement of
compensation coils was used to adjust a magnetic ﬁeld
of 1±0.2 mT in the trap region during excitation of the
171Yb+ clock transition. The corresponding quadratic
Zeeman shift of the ∆mF = 0 reference transition is in
the range of only 0.05 Hz. The trap region was pro-
tected from ambient heat sources by the light shield
of the trap setup. We assume that the thermal radia-
tion ﬁeld in the trap region represented an equilibrium
blackbody ﬁeld at room temperature and neglect the
corresponding contribution to the uncertainty budget.
In conclusion, we measured the frequency of the
electric-quadrupole clock transition of the 171Yb+ ion
with a relative uncertainty of 1 × 10−14. This demon-
strates the potential of the 171Yb+ standard as an
ultraprecise optical frequency reference. Simultane-
ously, we demonstrated the capability of a femtosecond
comb generator of measuring optical frequencies with
Cs clock accuracy. A future application can be the di-
rect frequency comparison of the 171Yb+ standard with
another optical standard such as the cold-atom based
calcium standard, aiming e.g. to measure a possible
variation of fundamental constants [12]. A drift of the
relative frequencies of these optical standards due to
a drift of the ﬁnestructure constant α by more than
10−15 per year appears excluded [12]. However, the
unprecedented measurement accuracy achievable with
femtosecond comb generators encourages one to pursue
such fundamental, ultra-precise measurements.

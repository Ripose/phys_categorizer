1 Problem

Deduce the form of a cylindrically symmetric plane electromagnetic wave that propagates in
vacuum.

A scalar, azimuthally symmetric wave of frequency ω that propagates in the positive z

direction could be written as

(1)
where ρ = √x2 + y2. Then, the problem is to deduce the form of the radial function f (ρ)
and any relevant condition on the wave number kz, and to relate that scalar wave function
to a complete solution of Maxwell’s equations.

ψ(r, t) = f (ρ)ei(kzz−ωt),

The waveform (1) has both wave velocity and group velocity equal to ω/kz. Comment
on the apparent superluminal character of the wave in case that kz < k = ω/c, where c is
the speed of light.

2 Solution

As the desired solution for the radial wave function proves to be a Bessel function, the
cylindrical plane waves have come to be called Bessel beams, following their introduction
by Durnin et al. [1, 2]. The question of superluminal behavior of Bessel beams has recently
been raised by Mugnai et al. [3].

Bessel beams are a realization of super-gain antennas [4, 5, 6] in the optical domain. A

simple experiment to generate Bessel beams is described in [7].

Sections 2.1 and 2.2 present two methods of solution for Bessel beams that satisfy the
Helmholtz wave equation. The issue of group and signal velocity for these waves is discussed
in sec. 2.3. Forms of Bessel beams that satisfy Maxwell’s equations are given in sec. 2.4.

2.1 Solution via the Wave Equation

we obtain

This is the diﬀerential equation for Bessel functions of order 0, so that

f (ρ) = J0(krρ),

(4)

where

z = k2.

The form of eq. (5) suggests that we introduce a (real) parameter α such that

kρ = k sin α,

and

kz = k cos α.

Then, the desired cylindrical plane wave has the form

ψ(r, t) = J0(k sin α ρ)ei(k cos α z−ωt),

(5)

(6)

(7)

which is commonly called a Bessel beam. The physical signiﬁcance of parameter α, and that
of the group velocity

will be discussed in sec. 2.3.

(8)

While eq. (7) is a solution of the Helmholtz wave equation (2), assigning ψ(r, t) to be a
single component of an electric ﬁeld, say Ex, does not provide a full solution to Maxwell’s
equations. For example, if E = ψˆx, then ∇ · E = ∂ψ/∂x 6= 0. Bessel beams that satisfy
Maxwell’s equations are given in sec. 2.4.

2.2 Solution via Scalar Diﬀraction Theory

The Bessel beam (7) has large amplitude only for |ρ| <∼ 1/k sin α, and maintains the same

radial proﬁle over arbitrarily large propagation distance z. This behavior appears to con-
tradict the usual lore that a beam of minimum transverse extent a diﬀracts to ﬁll a cone of
angle 1/a. Therefore, the Bessel beam (7) has been called “diﬀraction free” [2].

Here, we show that the Bessel beam does obey the formal laws of diﬀraction, and can be

deduced from scalar diﬀraction theory.

According to that theory [8], a cylindrically symmetric wave f (ρ) of frequency ω at the

plane z = 0 propagates to point r with amplitude

ψ(r, t) =

k

2πi Z Z ρ′dρ′dφf (ρ′)

ei(kR−ωt)

R

,

(9)

where R is the distance between the source and observation point. Deﬁning the observation
point to be (ρ, 0, z), we have

so that for large z,

R2 = z2 + ρ2 + ρ

′2 − 2ρρ′ cos φ,

R ≈ z +

ρ2 + ρ′2 − 2ρρ′ cos φ

2z

.

(10)

(11)

In the present case, we desire the amplitude to have form (1). As usual, we approximate
R by z in the denominator of eq. (9), while using approximation (11) in the exponential
factor. This leads to the integral equation

f (ρ)eikzz =

using a well-known integral representation of the Bessel function J0.

It is now plausible that the desired eigenfunction f (ρ) is a Bessel function, say J0(kρρ),
and on consulting a table of integrals of Bessel functions we ﬁnd an appropriate relation [9],

(13)

Comparing this with eq. (12), we see that f (ρ) = J0(kρρ) is indeed an eigenfunction provided
that

kz = k −
Thus, if we write kρ = k sin α, then for small α,

k2
ρ
2k

.

(14)

(15)

kz ≈ k(1 − α2/2) ≈ k cos α,

and the desired cylindrical wave again has form (7).

Strictly speaking, the scalar diﬀraction theory reproduces the “exact” result (7) only for
small α. But the scalar diﬀraction theory is only an approximation, and we predict with
conﬁdence that an “exact” diﬀraction theory would lead to the form (7) for all values of
parameter α. That is, “diﬀraction-free” beams are predicted within diﬀraction theory.

It remains that the theory of diﬀraction predicts that an inﬁnite aperture is needed to
produce a beam whose transverse proﬁle is invariant with longitudinal distance. That a
Bessel beam is no exception to this rule is reviewed in sec. 2.3.

The results of this section were inspired by [10]. One of the ﬁrst solutions for Gaussian

laser beams was based on scalar diﬀraction theory cast as an eigenfunction problem [11].

2.3 Superluminal Behavior

In general, the group velocity (8) of a Bessel beam exceeds the speed of light. However, this
apparently superluminal behavior cannot be used to transmit signals faster than lightspeed.
An important step towards understanding this comes from the interpretation of parameter
α as the angle with respect to the z axis of the wave vectors of an inﬁnite set of ordinary
plane waves whose superposition yields the Bessel beam [12]. To see this, we invoke the
integral representation of the Bessel function to write eq. (7) as

ψ(r, t) = J0(k sin α ρ)ei(k cos α z−ωt)

=

dφei(k sin α x cos φ+k sin α y sin φ+k cos α z−ωt)

(16)

dφei(q·r−ωt),

where the wave vector q, given by

q = k(sin α cos φ, sin α sin φ, cos α),

(17)

makes angle α to the z axis as claimed.

3

We now see that a Bessel beam is rather simple to produce in principle [2]. Just superpose
all possible plane waves with equal amplitude and a common phase that make angle α to
the z axis,

According to this prescription, we expect the z axis to be uniformly illuminated by the
Bessel beam. If that beam is created at the plane z = 0, then any annulus of equal radial
extent in that plane must project equal power into the beam. For large ρ this is readily
conﬁrmed by noting that J 2
0 (k sin α ρ) ≈ cos2(k sin α ρ + δ)/(k sin α ρ), so the integral of the
power over an annulus of one radial period, ∆ρ = π/(k sin α), is independent of radius.
Thus, from an energy perspective a Bessel beam is not conﬁned to a ﬁnite region about
the z axis. If the beam is to propagate a distance z from the plane z = 0, it must have radial
extent of at least ρ = z tan α at z = 0. An arbitrarily large initial aperture, and arbitrarily
large power, is required to generate a Bessel beam that retains its “diﬀraction-free” character
over an arbitrarily large distance.

Each of the plane waves that makes up the Bessel beam propagates with velocity c along
a ray that makes angle α to the z axis. The intersection of the z axis and a plane of constant
phase of any of these wave moves forward with superluminal speed c/ cos α, which is equal
to the phase and group velocities (8).

This superluminal behavior does not represent any violation of special relativity, but is
an example of the “scissors paradox” that the point of contact of a pair of scissors could
move faster than the speed of light while the tips of the blades are moving together at
sublightspeed. A ray of sunlight that makes angle α to the surface of the Earth similarly
leads to a superluminal velocity c/ cos α of the point of contact of a wave front with the
Earth.

However, we immediately see that a Bessel beam could not be used to send a signal from,
say, the origin, (0, 0, 0), to a point (0, 0, z) at a speed faster than light. A Bessel beam at
(0, 0, z) is made of rays of plane waves that intersect the plane z = 0 at radius ρ = z tan α.
Hence, to deliver a message from (0, 0, 0) to (0, 0, z) via a Bessel beam, the information must
ﬁrst propagate from the origin out to at least radius ρ = z tan α at z = 0 to set up the beam.
Then, the rays must propagate distance z/ cos α to reach point z with the message. The
total distance traveled by the information is thus z(1 + sin α)/ cos α, and the signal velocity
vs is given by

,

(18)

cos α

vs ≈ c

1 + sin α

which is always less than c. The group velocity and signal velocity for a Bessel beam are
very diﬀerent. Rather than being a superluminal carrier of information at its group velocity
c/ cos α, a modulated Bessel beam could be used to deliver messages only at speeds well
below that of light.

2.4 Solution via the Vector Potential

To deduce all components of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of a Bessel beam that satisﬁes
Maxwell’s equation starting from a single scalar wave function, we follow the suggestion of
Davis [13] and seek solutions for a vector potential A that has only a single component. We

4

work in the Lorentz gauge (and Gaussian units), so that the scalar potential Φ is related by

∇ · A +

1
c

∂Φ
∂t

= 0.

(19)

The vector potential can therefore have a nonzero divergence, which permits solutions having
only a single component. Of course, the electric and magnetic ﬁelds can be deduced from
the potentials via

and

E = −∇Φ −

1
c

∂A
∂t

,

(20)

(21)

B = ∇ × A.

For this, the scalar potential must ﬁrst be deduced from the vector potential using the
Lorentz condition (19). We consider waves of frequency ω and time dependence of the form
e−iωt, so that ∂Φ/∂t = −ikΦ. Then, the Lorentz condition yields

and the electric ﬁeld is given by

Φ = −

i
k∇ · A,

(22)

(23)

E = ik(cid:20)A +

1

k2∇(∇ · A)(cid:21) .

Then, ∇ · E = 0 since ∇2(∇ · A) + k2(∇ · A) = 0 for a vector potential A of frequency ω
that satiﬁes the wave equation (2), etc.
We already have a scalar solution (7) to the wave equation, which we now interpret as
the only nonzero component, Aj, of the vector potential for a Bessel beam that propagates
in the +z direction,

Aj(r, t) = ψ(r, t) ∝ J0(k sin α ρ)ei(k cos α z−ωt).

(24)

We consider ﬁve choices for the meaning of index j, namely x, y, z, ρ, and φ, which
lead to ﬁve types of Bessel beams. Of these, only the case of j = z corresponds to physical,
azimuthally symmetric ﬁelds, and so perhaps should be called the Bessel beam.

In calculating ∇(∇ · A) we use the identity J ′

(27)

(28)

A Bessel beam that obeys Maxwell’s equations and has purely x polarization of its electric
ﬁeld on the z axis includes nonzero y and z polarization at points oﬀ that axis, and does not
exhibit the azimuthal symmetry of the underlying vector potential.

2.4.2 j = y

This case is very similar to that of j = x.

2.4.3 j = z

In this case the electric and magnet ﬁelds retain azimuthal symmetry, so that it is convenient
to display the ρ, φ and z components of the ﬁelds. First,

∇ · A =

∂ψ
∂z

= ik cos α J0(k sin α ρ)ei(k cos α z−ωt).

(29)

Then, we divide the electric and magnetic ﬁelds by k sin α to ﬁnd the relatively simple forms:

and

Eρ = cos α J1(̺)ei(k cos α z−ωt),
Eφ = 0,
Ez = i sin α J0(̺)ei(k cos α z−ωt),

Bρ = 0,
Bφ = J1(̺)ei(k cos α z−ωt),
Bz = 0.

(30)

(31)

This Bessel beam is a transverse magnetic (TM) wave. The radial electric ﬁeld Eρ vanishes
on the z axis (as it must if that axis is charge free), while the longitudinal electric ﬁeld Ez
is maximal there. Cylindrically symmetric waves with radial electric polarization are often
called axicon beams [14].

2.4.4 j = ρ

In this case,

∇ · A =

and

Bρ = 0,
Bφ = cos α J0(̺)ei(k cos α z−ωt),
Bz = 0.

The radial electric ﬁeld diverges as 1/ρ2 for small ρ, so this case is unphysical.

2.4.5 j = φ

Here,

∇ · A =

1
ρ

∂ψ
∂φ

= 0.

After dividing by ik, the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are

Eρ = 0,
Eφ = J0(̺)ei(k cos α z−ωt),
Ez = 0,

and

Bρ = − cos α J0(̺)ei(k cos α z−ωt),
Bφ = 0,
Bz = −i sin α "J0(̺)

̺ − J1(̺)# ei(k cos α z−ωt).

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

(37)

These ﬁelds are unphysical due to the ﬁnite value of Eφ at ρ = 0, and the divergence of Bz
as ρ → 0.

Abstract

Anderson localization of classical waves in disordered media is a fundamental physical phe-

nomenon that has attracted attention in the past three decades. More recently, localization of

polar excitations in nanostructured metal-dielectric ﬁlms (also known as random planar compos-

ite) has been subject of intense studies. Potential applications of planar composites include local

near-ﬁeld microscopy and spectroscopy. A number of previous studies have relied on the quasistaic

approximation and a direct analogy with localization of electrons in disordered solids. Here I argue

that these two approaches are inadequate. I consider the localization problem without the qua-

sistatic approximation. I show that localization of polar excitations is characterized by algebraic

rather than exponential spatial conﬁnement. This result is also valid in two and three dimensions.

Numerical demonstration of a localization-delocalization transition is given. Finally, it is shown

that, contrary to the previous belief, localized modes can be eﬀectively coupled to running waves.

INTRODUCTION

Anderson localization (AL) of classical waves in disordered systems is a fundamental

physical phenomenon which takes place in the limit of strong resonant scattering when

the “photon mean free path” becomes the order of or less than one wavelength (the Ioﬀe-

Regel criterion) [1]. At a formal level, AL of electromagnetic or acoustic waves is similar

to localization of electrons in disordered solids. There are, however, substantial physical

diﬀerences. One such diﬀerence is that the motion of electrons can be ﬁnite. In contrast,

classical waves can not be, in principle, indeﬁnitely conﬁned in a ﬁnite spatial region. In the

case of electrons, one of the most important physical manifestations of AL (at zero temper-

ature) is the conductor-insulator transition [2]. Localization of classical waves is manifested

diﬀerently. If we consider an experiment in which classical waves are transmitted through

a disordered slab, an analog of conductivity is the transmission coeﬃcient. Assuming that

the slab material is non-absorbing, the transmission coeﬃcient can never turn to zero. How-

ever, if the waves are localized in the slab, the transmitted and reﬂected ﬁelds exhibit fast

spatial variations which are sample-speciﬁc (not self-averaging) and known as speckles [3].

The speckles can not be understood within the transport theory that describes statistical

averages. Speckle emission by localized modes in random positive-gain media is the basis

for operation of random lasers [4]. Thus, the common feature of localized states of both

electrons and classical waves is that the propagation can not be described by the Boltzmann

transport equation or the diﬀusion approximation to the former.

This paper is focused on AL of electromagnetic waves in a random structure which is dis-

tinctly diﬀerent from either two-dimensional or three-dimensional random media. Namely,

we will consider random planar composites (RPCs) [5]. The RPCs are made of small three-

dimensional scatterers which are randomly distributed in a thin planar layer. Thus, the

electromagnetic interaction in this system is essentially three-dimensional while the geome-

try is two-dimensional. The RPCs have attracted considerable recent attention due to the

variety of potential applications, including surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of pro-

teins [6, 7, 8]. The physical implication of AL of electromagnetic waves in the RPC can be

best understood by considering an experiment in which the sample is excited by a near-ﬁeld

probe. If the electromagnetic states in the sample are strongly localized (at the particular

electromagnetic frequency), the surface plasmon induced by the tip will also be localized

and not spread over the entire sample. The localization-delocalization transition is expected

to play a crucial role in the near-ﬁeld tomographic imaging techniques of Refs. 9, 10. If the

states are localized, each near-ﬁeld measurements will be sensitive only to the local envi-

ronment of the the tip, while in the opposite case, it would be sensitive to the structure of

the sample far away from the tip. Thus, for example, the extension of the surface-enhanced

Raman spectroscopic techniques of Refs. 6, 7, 8 to local subwavelengh-resolved imaging (for

sensing individual proteins) would be a much easier task in the presence of strong localiza-

tion.

The possibility and nature of AL of electromagnetic excitations in the RPCs have been

investigated theoretically and numerically [5, 11]. While the conclusions given in these

two references are somewhat conﬂicting, the respective theoretical approaches share some

common features. Most importantly, localization of the SP eigenmodes was studied in the

quasistatic approximation. However, AL is, essentially, an interference phenomenon [1].

Therefore, account of retardation is essential for its proper understanding. Second, a def-

inition of localization length of a mode based on its “radius of gyration” was adopted in

Refs. 5, 11. Here I argue that this deﬁnition, as well as the one based on radiative quality

factor (mode lifetime) [12, 13] can not be applied to the electromagnetic localization problem

in the RPCs.

Below, I discuss a number of important points concerning AL of classical waves, some

of which are applicable only to the RPCs and some are more general.

I also provide a

numerical demonstration of the Anderson transition in the RPCs. To this end, I use a

simple but physically relevant model of small spherical inclusions of diameter D embedded

in a transparent dielectric host medium and randomly distributed in a plane inside an L

L

×

box. Essentially, this is the model used in Refs. 12, 13. However, I work in a diﬀerent physical

regime and use a diﬀerent deﬁnition for localization. Most of the numerical examples shown

below were obtained in the limit D

L, where ℓ is the average inter-particle

such matrices are not very common in physics, a brief review of their spectral properties is

adduced. Eigenvalues of complex symmetric matrices are, generally, complex. The eigenvec-

tors form a complete (but not orthonormal) basis unless the matrix is defective. A matrix is

called defective if one of its eigenvectors is quasi-null, e.g, its dot product with itself (with-

out complex conjugation) is zero. The geometric multiplicity of a defective matrix is less

than its algebraic multiplicity. Non-degenerate symmetric matrices are all non-defective. A

matrix can be defective as a result of random degeneracy. The probability of such event is,

however, vanishingly small. Below, we assume that W is non-defective, which was the case

III. RESULTS

A FORTRAN code has been written to model a random RPC and to compute elements of

the matrix W as well as its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The latter task was accomplished

by utilization of the LAPACK subroutine ZGEEV. In general, W is a 3N

symmetric matrix. In the case of RPC, it is also a block matrix. It contains an N

be diagonalized independently. The code was compiled and executed on an HP rx4640

server (4x1.6GHz Itanium-II cpu) with the Intel’s FORTRAN compiler and MKL library.

We ﬁrst discuss how to determine if a certain eigenstate

sense. Various deﬁnitions of localizations that has been used for electrons in disordered

solids are reviewed in Ref. 16. In the literature on localisation of polar (electromagnetic)

modes in disordered composites, two approaches have been adopted. The ﬁrst approach

This deﬁnition is implicitly based on the assumption of exponential localization. However,

exponential decay (in space) of the weights mn(rj) is impossible for classical waves. This

follows already from the fact that the unperturbed Green’s function (2) in non-absorbing

transparent host media decays algebraically rather than exponentially. However, the expo-

nential localization is not an absolute requirement for AL. Indeed, the essential feature of

strongly localized states is that such states are discrete and can be, therefore, labeled by

countable indices [17]. These indices can be associated, for example, with localization regions

which are, by deﬁnition, countable. As a consequence, the localized states are normalized

in the usual sense, implying that

mn(r)rd−1dr converges at the upper limit, where d is the

R

dimensionality of embedding space. Note that for the RPCs d = 2, even though the inter-

action is three-dimensional. Therefore, a state is localized if the weights decay faster than

1/rd. In contrast, delocalized states belong to the true continuum (in an inﬁnite system).

Such states can not be normalized in the usual sense but instead satisfy

deﬁnition (8).

To illustrate this point, I introduce a a diﬀerent localization parameter. Let Mn be the

number of largest weights for the n-th mode whose sum is at least or larger than, say, 0.9.

We will refer to Mn as the participation number, although it is not directly analogous to the

participation number deﬁned as the inverse second moment of the probability density [16].

The second approach to deﬁning localization which has been used in the literature is based

on the eigenmode radiative quality factor Qn [12, 13]. Again, this deﬁnition rests on the

analogy with bound states in quantum mechanics and the assumption of exponential local-

ization. However, it is easy to see that propagating modes in three-dimensional transparent

periodic or homogeneous media are all strictly non-radiating (with γn = 0). An example of

a propagating mode in a one-dimensional periodic chain which is strictly non-radiating, is

given in Ref. 18. On the other hand, radiating modes can, in principle, be localized. As was

discussed above, the only requirement is that the far-zone ﬁeld of such modes decays faster

than 1/rd. This is illustrated in Fig. 2. Here we plot the inverse radiative quality factors γn

vs the corresponding values of Mn for the same set of parameters as in Fig. 1. First, it can be

seen that, while the localized modes tend to be of higher quality, the correlation is not very

strong. Second, there are two visibly distinct “branches” in Fig. 2a (Einc perpendicular to

the RPC). The top, lower quality, branch corresponds to modes with non-vanishing dipole
moments. According the criterion Mn ≪

non-vanishing dipole moment decay as 1/r6 - fast enough to guarantee localization even in

three dimensions. This fact underscores inadequacy of the quasistatic limit for consideration

of localization phenomena.

It is interesting to note that the RPCs are truly unique in one respect.

Indeed, for

the RPCs, we have d = 2 but the far-zone ﬁeld of a dipole decays as E

1/r and the

corresponding weights decay as m(r)

1/r2. But for localization to happen, the

1/r2 and d = 2 is very slow (logarithmic). Therefore,

∝

in a ﬁnite RPC sample, modes with non-vanishing dipole moment can be considered as

localized for all practical purposes.

So far, we have seen that some of the modes are localized on just a few inclusions. Now

we investigate if these modes actually form a band. To this end, we plot in Fig. 3 the values

of Mn vs the appropriate spectral parameter of the theory, which is the real part of the

corresponding eigenvalue wn. To see that Rewn is, indeed, a spectral parameter analogous

to energy, consider the following. The n-th mode is resonantly excited at an electromagnetic

frequency ω such that Re[z(ω)

wn(ω)] = 0 while for an isolated spherical inclusion the

−

resonance condition is Re[z(ω)] = 0. Thus, the real parts of the eigenvalues describe shifts

of resonant frequencies of collective excitations relative to the respective value in the non-

interacting limit. Only modes polarized perpendicular to the RPC are shown in Fig. 3. The

plots for parallel polarization are qualitatively similar. Analysis of Fig. 3 clearly reveals

a transition from delocalized to localized states.

In particular, all states with relatively

small values of D3Rewn are delocalized. Such states are characterized by relatively weak

interaction.

Indeed, for an isolated spherical inclusion which does not interact with its

environment, we have Rewn = 0. However, when interaction becomes suﬃciently strong, all

modes become localized. In the case of relatively low density (N = 103, ℓ

32D), most of

≈

the localized states are binary, i.e., involve excitation of only two inclusions. As the density

of inclusions increases, localized modes involving three, four and more inclusions emerge.

We now consider the possibility of coupling of localized modes to the external ﬁeld. It

has been previously shown within the quasistatic limit that strongly localized modes can not

be eﬀectively coupled to plane waves. Therefore, such modes were referred to as dark [5].

However, the dark modes become coupled to external plane waves if one considers ﬁrst non-

vanishing corrections in k, i.e., goes beyond the quasistatic limit. For example, in Ref. 14

it was shown that the fully antisymmetrical mode of two oscillating dipoles (with zero total

dipole moment) can be eﬀectively coupled to an external plane wave in the limit kL

0.

→

This coupling is explained by a small phase shift of the incident wave and the high quality

factor of the mode. Indeed, it can be seen from (7) that under the exact resonance condition

Re(z

wn) = 0, the excited dipole moments become proportional to f (eﬀ)

n = Qnfn. Thus,

−

even in samples that are small compared to the wavelength, high-quality modes with zero

or vanishing dipole moment can be eﬀectively excited under the resonance condition. When

the sample size is not small compared to the wavelength, even the strict resonance condition

is not required for eﬀective coupling. This is illustrated in Fig. 4. Here we plot the coupling

constants fn vs Mn for the same set of parameters as in Figs. 1 and 2. Since the coupling

Perhaps, the most counter-intuitive fact about the polar eigenmodes that can be under-

γn for diﬀerent ratios λ/L and for polarization perpendicular to the RPC. In the quasistatic

limit, it can be shown that for this particular polarization, fn = γn [15]. (Note that for

in-plane polarization, this equality may not hold due to polarization eﬀects.) This propor-

tionality is clearly visible in the case λ/L = 12.8. However, at smaller values of λ/L, there is
no strict proportionality. Thus, for example, in the case λ/L = 0.02, the modes with γn ≈

scattering. However, at a suﬃciently large time t = T , a steady state would be reached, in

which a ﬁnite electromagnetic energy would be transferred to plasmonic oscillations in the

mode. Since the incident wave was not scattered or absorbed, this may seem to contradict

energy conservation. In fact, the contradiction is resolved by noticing that a given mode is

weekly radiating only at a ﬁxed electromagnetic frequency ω. (Beyond the quasistatic limit,

both the eigenvectors

IV. SUMMARY

Localization of polar eigenmodes in random planar composites (RPCs) has been studied

theoretically and numerically. It was demonstrated that the localization criteria based on

exponential conﬁnement (analogy with electrons in solids) can not be applied polar excita-

tions in disordered composites and in RPCs in particular. This is because localization of

polar eigenmodes is algebraic, rather than exponential. An alternative approach based on

the participation number has been developed. It was shown that all electromagnetic states

in the RPC whose resonance frequencies are shifted from those of non-interacting inclusions

by a value larger than certain threshold are localized in the Anderson sense. The band of

localized states shown in Fig. 3 for suﬃciently large values of

Re(wn)

can be mapped to

|

|

an interval of electromagnetic frequencies if the material properties of the inclusions and

the host medium are speciﬁed. It should be noted that much stronger spectral shifts will

be observed at higher concentrations of inclusions. However, theoretical consideration of

the high-density limit will require solving the electromagnetic problem without the dipole

approximation. The author expects that this will not inﬂuence the localization properties of

the eigenmodes. Finally, possibility of coupling of localized modes to the far ﬁeld has been

studied. It was shown that, contrary to the previous belief, localized modes in the RPCs

can be eﬀectively coupled to the far ﬁeld.

Abstract

Two alternative hypotheses try to explain the origin of the continuum.
The present communication gives new argument in favor of the dimer hy-
pothesis. This argument is based on the existence of the wide component
of line in absorption spectrum of polyatomic molecules.

The continuum of water vapor absorption in the region of atmospheric win-
dows (8–14 and 3–5 µm) was found in 1938 [1]. The ﬁrst explanation of its
nature was that continuum is the sum of far wings of collisionally broadened
lines of rotational and vibrational-rotational transitions in water molecules.

Afterwards an anomalously strong square dependence of absorption on water
vapor pressure was observed along with its exponential negative temperature
dependence [2,3]. The slope of the exponent is 5 kcal/mole and is thus equal to
the binding energy of molecules in a dimer of water. These are strong arguments
in favor of the dimer hypothesis which assumes that the continuum is caused
by the presence of water dimers in the gas. But these are indirect proofs. In
succeeding years no new facts in favor of the dimer hypothesis were found. But
it was deﬁnitely determined that no intensive absorption bands of water dimer
molecules are present in the region of atmospheric windows. This is considered
to be the main argument against the dimer hypothesis. In addition, the shape
of the continuum corresponds better to far wings of the lines than to some local
bands of molecules absorption. As a result, in succeeding years most scientists
again gave preference to the monomer hypothesis [4].

Thus, it became a deadlock situation. There existed explicit indirect indi-
cations of the dimer hypothesis. Direct spectroscopic studies seem contradict it
and show the validity of the monomer hypothesis, which fails to explain satis-
factorily the temperature dependence.

The present communication is aimed at drawing the attention of scientists
to a new argument in favor of the dimer hypothesis. A rather elegant way to
end the deadlock now exists: the continuum is actually formed by far wings of
molecule absorption lines. But these are mainly the wings of absorption lines of
water dimer molecules. The lines of dimer molecules have intensive Lorentzian
wings, whose absorption cross section can be several orders of magnitude higher
than for monomers.

Such unconventional supposition has come from another ﬁeld of scientiﬁc in-
vestigations, namely, from those of IR multiple-photon excitation of molecules.
The existence of broad intensive line wings (or wide component of line) in the
absorption spectrum of polyatomic molecules was shown in [5]. There are many

1

proofs of the existence of these wings. For example, for number of polyatomic
molecules the far Lorentzian wings of absorption bands in the gaseous phase
were founded. Their intensity is in good agreement with the data on the satu-
ration degree of a linear spectrum of molecules absorption by a pulse CO2-laser
radiation at low gas pressure. On the basis of these data the relative integral
intensity of line wings can easily be evaluated. It is ∼ 0.6% for SF6 and SiF4
molecules, 11% for CH3SiF3 molecules, ∼ 90% for (CF3)2O and (CF3)2CO
molecules and > 90% for C6H5SiF3 molecules.

One can see that the intensity of the line wings grows rapidly with the
number of atoms in a molecule. Accordingly, it can be expected that in molecule
dimers the intensity of line wings will be considerably higher than for monomers.
No data are available yet on the intensity of line wings in water dimers. But for
ethylene dimers the published experimental results [6–8] allow such evaluation
to do. Nearly 80% of the integral intensity of the absorption line of ethylene
dimers is in it wings.

Thus, the problem of the continuum of water vapor absorption will be totally
clariﬁed when the width and the intensity of the line wings of rotational and
vibrational-rotational transitions of water dimer molecules are measured [9]. For
their detection more powerful lasers (CO and HF-lasers) should be used than
that used in the work [10].

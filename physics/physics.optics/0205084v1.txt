Abstract
We present a formalism for light optics starting with the Maxwell equations
and casting them into an exact matrix form taking into account the spatial
and temporal variations of the permittivity and permeability. This 8
8
matrix representation is used to construct the optical Hamiltonian. This has
a close analogy with the algebraic structure of the Dirac equation, enabling
the use of the rich machinery of the Dirac electron theory. We get interesting
wavelength-dependent contributions which can not be obtained in any of the
traditional approaches.

1 Introduction

The traditional scalar wave theory of optics (including aberrations to all
orders) is based on the beam-optical Hamiltonian derived using the Fermat’s
principle. This approach is purely geometrical and works adequately in the
scalar regime. The other approach is based on the Helmholtz equation which
is derived from the Maxwell equations. Then one makes the square-root of
the Helmholtz operator followed by an expansion of the radical [1, 2]. This
approach works to all orders and the resulting expansion is no diﬀerent from
the one obtained using the geometrical approach of the Fermat’s principle.

Another way of obtaining the aberration expansion is based on the al-
gebraic similarities between the Helmholtz equation and the Klein-Gordon
equation. Exploiting this algebraic similarity the Helmholtz equation is lin-
earized in a procedure very similar to the one due to Feschbach-Villars, for
linearizing the Klein-Gordon equation. This brings the Helmholtz equation

to a Dirac-like form and then follows the procedure of the Foldy-Wouthuysen
expansion used in the Dirac electron theory. This approach, which uses the
algebraic machinery of quantum mechanics, was developed recently [3], pro-
viding an alternative to the traditional square-root procedure. This scalar
formalism gives rise to wavelength-dependent contributions modifying the
aberration coeﬃcients [4]. The algebraic machinery of this formalism is very
similar to the one used in the quantum theory of charged-particle beam optics,
based on the Dirac [5] and the Klein-Gordon [6] equations respectively. The
detailed account for both of these is available in [7]. A treatment of beam
optics taking into account the anomalous magnetic moment is available in [8].
As for the polarization: A systematic procedure for the passage from
scalar to vector wave optics to handle paraxial beam propagation problems,
completely taking into account the way in which the Maxwell equations cou-
ple the spatial variation and polarization of light waves, has been formu-
lated by analysing the basic Poincar´e invariance of the system, and this
procedure has been successfully used to clarify several issues in Maxwell op-
tics [9, 10, 11].

In all the above approaches, the beam-optics and the polarization are
studied separately, using very diﬀerent machineries. The derivation of the
Helmholtz equation from the Maxwell equations is an approximation as one
neglects the spatial and temporal derivatives of the permittivity and perme-
ability of the medium. Any prescription based on the Helmholtz equation is
bound to be an approximation, irrespective of how good it may be in cer-
tain situations. It is very natural to look for a prescription based fully on
the Maxwell equations. Such a prescription is sure to provide a deeper un-
derstanding of beam-optics and polarization in a uniﬁed manner. With this
as the chief motivation we construct a formalism starting with the Maxwell
equations in a matrix form: a single entity containing all the four Maxwell
equations.

In our approach we require an exact matrix representation of the Maxwell
equations in a medium taking into account the spatial and temporal varia-
tions of the permittivity and permeability. It is necessary and suﬃcient to
use 8
8 matrices for such an exact representation. The derivation of the
required matrix representation, and how it diﬀers from the numerous other
ones is presented in Part-I [12].

×

In the present Part (Part-II) we proceed with the exact matrix represen-
tation of the Maxwell equations derived in Part-I, and construct a general

2

formalism. The derived representation has a very close algebraic correspon-
dence with the Dirac equation. This enables us to apply the machinery of the
Foldy-Wouthuysen expansion used in the Dirac electron theory. The Foldy-
Wouthuysen transformation technique is outlined in Appendix-A. General
expressions for the Hamiltonians are derived without assuming any speciﬁc
form for the refractive index. These Hamiltonians are shown to contain the
extra wavelength-dependent contributions which arise very naturally in our
approach. In Part-III
[13] we apply the general formalism to the speciﬁc
examples: A. Medium with Constant Refractive Index. This example is es-
sentially for illustrating some of the details of the machinery used.

The other application, B. Axially Symmetric Graded Index Medium is
used to demonstrate the power of the formalism. Two points are worth
mentioning, Image Rotation: Our formalism gives rise to the image rotation
(proportional to the wavelength) and we have derived an explicit relationship
for the angle of the image rotation. The other pertains to the aberrations: In
our formalism we get all the nine aberrations permitted by the axial symme-
try. The traditional approaches give six aberrations. Our formalism modiﬁes
these six aberration coeﬃcients by wavelength-dependent contributions and
also gives rise to the remaining three permitted by the axial symmetry. The
existence of the nine aberrations and image rotation are well-known in axi-
ally symmetric magnetic lenses, even when treated classically. The quantum
treatment of the same system leads to the wavelength-dependent modiﬁca-
tions [7]. The alternate procedure for the Helmholtz optics in [3, 4] gives the
usual six aberrations (though modiﬁed by the wavelength-dependent contri-
butions) and does not give any image rotation. These extra aberrations and
the image rotation are the exclusive outcome of the fact that the formalism
is based on the Maxwell equations, and done exactly.

−→

The traditional beam-optics is completely obtained from our approach in
the limit wavelength, ¯λ
0, which we call as the traditional limit of our
formalism. This is analogous to the classical limit obtained by taking ¯h
0
in the quantum prescriptions. The scheme of using the Foldy-Wouthuysen
machinery in this formalism is very similar to the one used in the quantum
theory of charged-particle beam optics [5, 6, 7]. There too one recovers the
0 where λ0 = ¯h/p0 is the de Broglie
classical prescriptions in the limit λ0 −→
wavelength and p0 is the design momentum of the system under study.

−→

The studies on the polarization are in progress. Some of the results in [11]
have been obtained as the lowest order approximation of the more general

3

framework presented here. These will be presented in Part-IV soon [14].

2 An exact matrix representation of the

Maxwell equations in a medium

Matrix representations of the Maxwell equations are very well-known [15]-
[16]. However, all these representations lack an exactness or/and are given
in terms of a pair of matrix equations. A treatment expressing the Maxwell
equations in a single matrix equation instead of a pair of matrix equations
was obtained recently [12]. This representation contains all the four Maxwell
equations in presence of sources taking into account the spatial and temporal
variations of the permittivity ǫ(r, t) and the permeability µ(r, t).

Maxwell equations [17, 18] in an inhomogeneous medium with sources are

where ǫ is the permittivity of the medium and µ is the permeability

given by v(r, t) =

The above optical Hamiltonian is exact (as exact as the Maxwell equations
in a time-independent linear media). The approximations are made only at
the time of doing speciﬁc calculations. Apart from the exactness, the optical

appropriate physical interpretations. The relevant point is:

We note that the upper component (Ψ+) is coupled to the lower component
(Ψ−) through the logarithmic divergence of the resistance function. If this
coupling function, w = 0 or is approximated to be zero, then the equations
for (Ψ+) and (Ψ−) get completely decoupled, leading to two independent
equations. Each of these two equations is equivalent to the other. These are
the leading equations for our studies of beam-optics and polarization. In the
optics context any contribution from the gradient of the resistance function
can be assumed to be negligible. With this reasonable assumption we can
decouple the equations and reduce the problem from eight dimensions to four
dimensions. In the following sections we shall present a formalism with the
approximation w
0. After constructing the formalism in four dimensions
we shall also address the question of dealing with the contributions coming
from the gradient of the resistance function. This will require the application

≈

7

of the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation technique in cascade as we shall see.
This justiﬁes the usage of the two derived laboratory functions in place of
permittivity and permeability respectively.

3 The Beam-Optical Formalism

In the previous section, starting with the Maxwell equations we presented
8 matrices. From
the exact representation of the Maxwell equations using 8
this representation we constructed the optical Hamiltonian having 8
8 ma-
trices. The coupling of the upper and lower components of the corresponding
eight-vector was neatly expressed through the logarithmic divergence of the
laboratory function, the resistance. We reason that in the optical context
we can safely ignore this term and reduce the problem from eight to four
dimensions without any loss of physical content.

Proceeding with our analogy with the Dirac equation: this extra term

dropped (while going from the exact to the almost-exact) is analogous to the
anomalous magnetic/electric moment term coupled to the electric/magnetic
ﬁelds respectively. However it should be born in mind that in our exact
treatment, both the terms were derived from the Maxwell equations, where
as in the Dirac theory the anomalous terms are added based on experimental

It is to be noted that the square of the Hamiltonian in our formalism diﬀers
from the square of the Hamiltonian in the square-root approaches [1, 2] and
the scalar approach in [3, 4]. This is essentially the same type of diﬀerence
which exists in the Dirac case. There too, the square of the Dirac Hamiltonian
B, the Pauli term which couples the
¯hqΣ
gives rise to extra pieces (such as,
spin to the magnetic ﬁeld) which is absent in the Schr¨odinger and the Klein-
Gordon descriptions. It is this diﬀerence in the square of the Hamiltonians
which give rise to the various extra wavelength-dependent contributions in
our formalism. These diﬀerences persist even in the approximation when the
polarization term is neglected.

information about the refractive index n(r).

Note that, the paraxial Hamiltonian (23) and the leading order aberration
Hamiltonian (25) diﬀers from the ones derived in the traditional approaches.
These diﬀerences arise by the presence of the wavelength-dependent contri-
butions which occur in two guises. One set occurs totally independent of the
polarization term in the basic Hamiltonian. This set is a multiple of the unit
matrix or at most the matrix β. The other set involves the contributions
coming from the polarization term in the starting optical Hamiltonian. This
gives rise to both matrix contributions and the non-matrix contributions,
as the squares of the polarization matrices is unity. We shall discuss the
contributions of the polarization to the beam optics elsewhere. Here, it suf-
ﬁces to note existence of the the wavelength-dependent contributions in two
distinguishable guises, which are not present in the traditional prescriptions.

4 When w

= 0

×

In the previous sections we assumed, w = 0 and this enabled us to develop
4 matrices via the Foldy-Wouthuysen machinery. The
a formalism using 4
Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation enables us to eliminate the odd part in
the 4
4 matrices, to any desired order of accuracy. Here too we have the
identical problem, but a step higher in dimensions. So, we need to apply the
Foldy-Wouthuysen to reduce the strength of the odd part in eight dimensions.
This will reduce the problem from eight to four dimensions.

×

We start with the grand optical equation in (13) and proceed with the
Foldy-Wouthuysen transformations as before, but with each quantity in dou-
ble the number of dimensions. Symbolically this means:

where, w2 = w
w, the square of the logarithmic gradient of the resis-
tance function. This is how the basic optical Hamiltonian (17) gets modi-
ﬁed. The next degree of accuracy is achieved by going a step further in the
Foldy-Wouthuysen iteration and obtaining the ˆ
(4)
g . Then, this would be
H
the higher reﬁned starting optical Hamiltonian, further modifying the basic
optical Hamiltonian (17). This way we can apply the Foldy-Wouthuysen in
cascade to obtain the higher order contributions coming from the logarithmic
gradient of the resistance function, to any desired degree of accuracy. We are
very unlikely to need any of these contributions, but it is possible to keep
track of them.

5 Concluding Remarks

We start with the Maxwell equations and express them in a matrix form in
a medium with varying permittivity and permeability in presence of sources
using 8
8 matrices. From this exact matrix representation we construct the
exact optical Hamiltonian for a monochromatic quasiparaxial light beam.
The optical Hamiltonian has a very close algebraic similarity with the Dirac
equation. We exploit this similarity to adopt the standard machinery, namely

×

13

the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation technique of the Dirac theory. This
enabled us to obtain the beam-optical Hamiltonian to any desired degree of
accuracy. We further get the wavelength-dependent contributions to at each
order, starting with the lowest-order paraxial paraxial Hamiltonian.

The beam-optical Hamiltonians also have the wavelength-dependent ma-
trix terms which are associated with the polarization. In this approach we
have been able to derive a Hamiltonian which contains both the beam-optics
and the polarization. In Part-III [13] we shall apply the formalism to the
speciﬁc examples and see how the beam-optics (paraxial behaviour and the
In
aberrations) gets modiﬁed by the wavelength-dependent contributions.
Part-IV [14] we shall examine the polarization component of the formalism
presented here.

In the traditional scheme the purpose of expanding the light optics Hamil-
tonian ˆH =
as the expansion
parameter is to understand the propagation of the quasiparaxial beam in
terms of a series of approximations (paraxial + nonparaxial). Similar is the
situation in the case of the charged-particle optics. Let us recall that in rela-
tivistic quantum mechanics too one has a similar problem of understanding
the relativistic wave equations as the nonrelativistic approximation plus the
relativistic correction terms in the quasirelativistic regime. For the Dirac
equation (which is ﬁrst order in time) this is done most conveniently using
the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation leading to an terative diagonalization
technique.

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

The main framework of the formalism of optics, used here (and in the
charged-particle optics) is based on the transformation technique of the
Foldy-Wouthuysen theory which casts the Dirac equation in a form display-
ing the diﬀerent interaction terms between the Dirac particle and and an ap-
plied electromagnetic ﬁeld in a nonrelativistic and easily interpretable form
(see, [19]-[23], for a general discussion of the role of the Foldy-Wouthuysen-
type transformations in particle interpretation of relativistic wave equations).
In the Foldy-Wouthuysen theory the Dirac equation is decoupled through a
canonical transformation into two two-component equations: one reduces to

14

the Pauli equation in the nonrelativistic limit and the other describes the
negative-energy states.

Let us describe here brieﬂy the standard Foldy-Wouthuysen theory so that
the way it has been adopted for the purposes of the above studies in optics
will be clear. Let us consider a charged-particle of rest-mass m0, charge q in

In the general case, when the electron is in a time-dependent electromag-
netic ﬁeld it is not possible to construct an exp(i ˆS) which removes the odd
operators from the transformed Hamiltonian completely. Therefore, one has
to be content with a nonrelativistic expansion of the transformed Hamilto-
nian in a power series in 1/m0c2 keeping through any desired order. Note

the electrostatic and magnetic dipole energies. The next two terms, taken
together (for hermiticity), contain the spin-orbit interaction. The last term,
the so-called Darwin term, is attributed to the zitterbewegung (trembling
motion) of the Dirac particle: because of the rapid coordinate ﬂuctuations
over distances of the order of the Compton wavelength (2π¯h/m0c) the particle
sees a somewhat smeared out electric potential.

It is clear that the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation technique expands
the Dirac Hamiltonian as a power series in the parameter 1/m0c2 enabling the
use of a systematic approximation procedure for studying the deviations from
the nonrelativistic situation. We note the analogy between the nonrelativistic
particle dynamics and paraxial optics:

Noting the above analogy, the idea of Foldy-Wouthuysen form of the Dirac
theory has been adopted to study the paraxial optics and deviations from it
by ﬁrst casting the Maxwell equations in a spinor form resembling exactly the
Dirac equation (A.1, A.2) in all respects: i.e., a multicomponent Ψ having
the upper half of its components large compared to the lower components
and the Hamiltonian having an even part ( ˆ

), a suitable

. The additional feature of our formalism is to return
O
ﬁnally to the original representation after making an extra approximation,
dropping β from the ﬁnal reduced optical Hamiltonian, taking into account
the fact that we are primarily interested only in the forward-propagating
beam.

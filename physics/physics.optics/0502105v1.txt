1 Introduction

Over many years the theory of localized waves (LW), or nondiﬀracting waves, and in

particular of the so-called X-shaped waves, has been developed, generalized, and exper-

imentally veriﬁed in many ﬁelds, such as optics, microwaves and acoustics[1]. These

new solutions to the wave equations (and, in particular, to the Maxwell equations) have

the noticeable characteristic of resisting the diﬀraction eﬀects for long distances, i.e., of

possessing a large depth of ﬁeld.

Such waves can be divided into two classes: the localized beams and the localized

pulses. With regard to the beams, the most popular is the Bessel beam.

Much work was made about the properties and applications of a single Bessel beam,

while some work has been done in connection with Bessel beam superpositions performed

by summing or integrating over their frequency (by producing, e.g., the well-known “X-

shaped pulses” and/or their velocity (for example, it has been studied the space-time

focusing of diﬀerent-speed X-shaped pulses). By contrast, only a few papers have been

addressed to the properties and applications of superpositions of Bessel beams with the

same frequency, but with diﬀerent longitudinal wave numbers. The few works existing

on this subject have shown some surprising possibilities associated with this particular

type of superpositions, mainly the possibility of controlling the transverse shape of the

resulting beam[2, 3].

hologram.

The other important point, i.e., that of controlling the longitudinal shape, has been

even more rarely addressed, and the relevant papers have been so far conﬁned to numerical

optimization processes[4, 5], aimed at ﬁnding out an appropriate computer-generated

3

In this work we develop a very simple method∗∗ , having recourse to superpositions

of forward propagating and equal-frequency Bessel beams only, that allows controlling

the beam-intensity longitudinal shape within a chosen interval 0

z

L, where z is the

≤

≤

propagation axis and L can be much greater than the wavelength λ of the monochromatic

light (or sound) which is being used. Inside such a space interval, indeed, we succeed in

constructing a stationary envelope whose longitudinal intensity pattern can approximately

assume any desired shape, including, for instance, one or more high-intensity peaks (with

distances between them much larger than λ); and which results —in addition— to be

naturally endowed also with a good transverse localization.∗∗∗

This intensity envelope remains static, i.e., has velocity v = 0; and because of this in

a previous paper[6] we have called “Frozen Waves” (FW) these new solutions to the wave

equations (and, in particular, to the Maxwell equations). Inside the envelope of a FW

only the carrier wave does propagate: And the longitudinal shape, within the interval

L, can be chosen in such a way that no nonnegligible ﬁeld exists outside the

pre-determined high-intensity region.

We also suggest a simple apparatus capable of generating the mentioned stationary

Static wave solutions like these are noticeable also for the diﬀerent and interesting

applications they can have, especially in electromagnetism and acoustics, such as optical

tweezers, atom guides, optical or acoustic bistouries, optical micro-lithography, electro-

magnetic or ultrasound high-intensity ﬁelds for various important medical purposes, and

∗∗∗ When we get a complete control on the longitudinal shape, we cannot have —however— a total
control also on the transverse localization, since our stationary ﬁelds are of course constrained to obey
the wave equation.

2 The mathematical methodology:∗∗ Stationary
waveﬁelds with arbitrary longitudinal shape, ob-
tained by superposing equal-frequency Bessel
beams

Let us start from the well-known axis-symmetric zeroth order Bessel beam solution to the

wave equation:

numbers, respectively. We also impose the conditions

(which imply ω/β

as well as a physical behavior of the Bessel function J0.

Now, let us make a superposition of 2N + 1 Bessel beams with the same frequency

Looking at Eq.(6), one might be tempted to take βn = 2πn/L, thus obtaining a

Superpositions of Bessel beams with βn = 2πn/L have been actually used in some works

to obtain a large set of transverse amplitude proﬁles[2, 3]. However, for our purposes, this

choice is not appropriate, due to two principal reasons: 1) It yields negative values for

βn (when n < 0), which implies backwards propagating components (since ω0 > 0); 2)

In the cases when L >> λ0, which are of our interest here, the main terms of the series

would correspond to very small values of βn, which results in a very short ﬁeld-depth

of the corresponding Bessel beams (when generated by ﬁnite apertures), preventing the

creation of the desired envelopes far form the source.

Therefore, we need to make a better choice for the values of βn, which allows forward

propagation components only, and a good depth of ﬁeld. This problem can be solved by

putting

where Q > 0 is a value to be chosen (as we shall see) according to the given experimental

situation, and the desired degree of transverse ﬁeld localization. Due to Eq.(5), we get

βn = Q +

Inequality (8), can be used to determine the maximum value of n, that we call Nmax,

once Q, L and ω0 have been chosen.

As a consequence, for getting a longitudinal intensity pattern approximately equal to

the desired one,

F (z)

Obviously, one obtains only an approximation to the desired longitudinal pattern, because

the trigonometric series (9) is necessarily truncated (N

Its total number of

The coeﬃcients An will yield the amplitudes and the relative phases of each Bessel

beam in the superposition.

Because we are adding together zero-order Bessel functions, we can expect a high ﬁeld

concentration around ρ = 0. Moreover, due to the known non-diﬀractive behavior of the

Bessel beams, we expect that the resulting waveﬁeld will preserve its transverse pattern

in the entire interval 0

The methodology developed here deals with the longitudinal intensity pattern control.

Obviously, we cannot get a total 3D control, due the fact that the ﬁeld must obey the wave

equation. However, we can use two ways to have some control over the transverse behavior

too. The ﬁrst is through the parameter Q of Eq.(7). Actually, we have some freedom

in the choice of this parameter, and FWs representing the same longitudinal intensity

pattern can possess diﬀerent values of Q. The important point is that, in superposition

(11), using a smaller value of Q makes the Bessel beams possess a higher transverse

concentration (because, on decreasing the value of Q, one increases the value of the Bessel

beams transverse numbers), and this will reﬂect in the resulting ﬁeld, which will present

a narrower central transverse spot. We will exemplify this fact in the next Section. The

second way to control the transverse intensity pattern is using higher order Bessel beams,

3 Some examples

In this Section we shall present a few examples of our methodology.

First example:

as we said). In this example, let us put L = 0.2 m.

We can then easily calculate the coeﬃcients An, which appear in the superposition

(11), by inserting Eq.(13) into Eq.(10). Let us choose, for instance, Q = 0.999 ω0/c: This

choice allows the maximum value Nmax = 316 for n, as one can infer from Eq.(8). Let

us emphasize that one is not compelled to use just N = 316, but can adopt for N any

values smaller than it; more generally, any value smaller than that calculated via Eq.(8).

Of course, on using the maximum value allowed for N, one gets a better result.

In the present case, let us adopt the value N = 30.

In Fig.1(a) we compare the

intensity of the desired longitudinal function F (z) with that of the Frozen Wave, Ψ(ρ =

0, z, t), obtained from Eq.(9) by adopting the mentioned value N = 30.

Figure 1: (a) Comparison between the intensity of the desired longitudinal function F (z)
and that of our Frozen Wave (FW), Ψ(ρ = 0, z, t), obtained from Eq.(9). The solid line
represents the function F (z), and the dotted one our FW. (b) 3D-plot of the ﬁeld-intensity
of the FW chosen in this case by us.

One can verify that a good agreement between the desired longitudinal behavior and our

approximate FW is already got with N = 30. The use of higher values for N can only

improve the approximation. Figure 1(b) shows the 3D-intensity of our FW, given by

Eq.(11). One can observe that this ﬁeld possesses the desired longitudinal pattern, while

being endowed with a good transverse localization.

Second example:

and l4 = 7L/10 + ∆z34 with ∆z34 = L/70. In this example we choose L = 0.02 m.

Again, we can calculate the coeﬃcients An by inserting Eq.(14) into Eq.(10), and use

them in our superposition (9). In this case, we chose Q = 0.995 ω0/c: This choice allows

a maximum value of n given by Nmax = 158 (one can see this by exploiting Eq.(8)). But

for simplicity we adopt once more N = 35, hoping that Eq.(11) will yield a good enough

approximation of the desired function.

We compare in Fig.2(a) the intensity of the desired longitudinal function F (z) with

that of our FW, Ψ(ρ = 0, z, t), obtained from Eq.(9) by using N = 35: We can verify a

good agreement between the desired longitudinal behaviour and our FW. Obviously we

can improve the approximation by using larger values of N.

In Fig.2(b) we show the 3D ﬁeld intensity of our FW, forwarded by Eq.(11). We can

see that this ﬁeld has a good transverse localization and possesses the desired longitudinal

pattern.

.

Third example (controlling the transverse shape too):

We want to take advantage of this new example for addressing an important question:

We can expect that, for a desired longitudinal pattern of the ﬁeld intensity, by choosing

smaller values of the parameter Q one will get FWs with narrower transverse width [for

the same number of terms in the series entering Eq.(11)], because of the fact that the

Bessel beams in Eq.(11) will possess larger transverse wave numbers, and, consequently,

higher transverse concentrations. We can verify this expectation by considering, for

instance, inside the usual range 0

intensity pattern, will possess diﬀerent transverse localizations. Namely, let us consider

L = 0.06 m and ∆z = L/100, and the two values Q = 0.999 ω0/c and Q = 0.995 ω0/c.

In both cases the coeﬃcients An will be the same, calculated from Eq.(10), on using this

time the value N = 45 in superposition (11). The results are shown in Figs.3(a) and 3(b).

Both FWs have the same longitudinal intensity pattern, but the one with the smaller Q

is endowed with a narrower transverse width.

pattern. We can observe that in this case (with a lower value for Q) a higher transverse
localization is obtained.

In Section 5 we shall show that a better control of the transverse shape can be obtained

by using higher order Bessel beams in superposition (11).

4 Spatial resolution and Residual intensity

In connection with a FW of a given frequency, it is of practical (and theoretical)

interest to investigate its Spatial resolution, its Residual intensity, the Size of the source

necessary to generate it, as well as the minimum distance from the source needed to get

Let us ﬁrst comment that, in lossless media, the theory of FWs can furnish results

similar to the free-space ones. This happens because FWs are suitable superpositions

of Bessel beams with the same frequency, so that there is no problem with the material

Here, we deal with lossless media only.

Let us address the question of the longitudinal and transverse spatial resolution for

such a FW.

In connection with the longitudinal case, once we choose a desired longitudinal inten-

sity ﬁeld conﬁguration,

F (z)

|

|

a certain longitudinal width ∆z, we wish to investigate whether it is possible to obtain

such a spatial resolution, and what are the relevant parameters for getting good results.

As one can expect, this question is directly related to the number 2N + 1 of terms in

superposition (11): More speciﬁcally, in superposition (9).

Once the values of the frequency ω0, and the parameters L and Q are chosen, the

best approximation that we can get for a given longitudinal intensity-ﬁeld conﬁguration,
2, is obtained by using Eq.(9) with the maximum number of terms 2Nmax + 1, where

F (z)

|

|
Nmax is calculated from is calculated through inequality (8).

As we have seen in the previous Sections, it is not always necessary to use N = Nmax,

and frequently a smaller value of N can provide us with good results. But even in this

14

cases, when a value N < Nmax is quite suﬃcient to furnish the desired spatial resolution,

nevertheless it can be desirable to increase the value of N for lowering the longitudinal

residual intensities, as we are going to see.

In the cases in which not even the value N = Nmax yields a good result, we have to

adopt a smaller value for the parameter Q so to increase, in this way, the value of Nmax

itself. For quantifying mathematically the precision of our approximation, one may have

recourse to the mean square deviation, D,

The case of the transverse spatial resolution cannot be tackled in such a detail, since,

as we know, one cannot have a complete three-dimensional control of the ﬁeld. In the

previous Section we have seen that we can get, however, some control on the transverse

spot size through the parameter Q. Actually, Eq.(11), that deﬁnes our FW, is a superpo-

sition of zero-order Bessel beams, and, due to this fact, the resulting ﬁeld is expected to

possess a transverse localization around ρ = 0. Each Bessel beam in superposition (11)

is associated with a central spot with transverse size, or width, ∆ρn ≈

∆z = L/500.

Figures 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c) show the resulting FWs obtained by using, in superposition

(9), N = 100, N = 250 and N = 300, respectively. We can see in the ﬁrst case that

N = 100 is not enough for yielding a good result. On the other hand, the second and

third cases, with N = 250 and N = 300, seem to reproduce the desired pattern very

well, with no apparent diﬀerence between the two cases. However, Fig.5 shows that the

residual intensity for the third case is smaller than for the second one, conﬁrming the

previous conclusions.

Figure 6(a) shows the transverse intensity pattern of the peak (in the plane z = L/2)

for the case with N = 250. We can see that the value of the transverse spot width agrees

very well with our estimate (16), which furnishes, in this case, the value ∆ρ

1.22 µm.

From Fig.6(b) one can visually evaluate the residual intensity of the transverse pattern:

One can observe that the transverse decay is strong and much faster than that presented

by Bessel beams. This ﬁgure too conﬁrms our previous conclusions.

using higher-order Bessel beams

We have shown in the previous Section how to get a very strong control over the

longitudinal intensity pattern of a beam using suitable superposition of zero-order Bessel

beams.

As already mentioned, due to the fact that the resulting beam must obey the wave

equation, we cannot get a total three-dimensional control of the wave pattern; but we

have shown that we can have some control on the transverse behavior: More speciﬁcally,

we can control the transverse spot size through the parameter Q, which deﬁnes the values

of the transverse wave numbers of the Bessel beams entering superposition (11).

In this Section we are going to argue that it is possible to increase even more our

control of the transverse shape by using higher-order Bessel beams in our fundamental

superposition (11). Despite the method presented in this Section is not yet demonstrated

in a rigorous mathematical way, it can be understood and accepted on the basis of simple

and intuitive arguments. The basic idea is obtaining the desired longitudinal intensity

pattern, not along the axis ρ = 0, but on a cylindrical surface corresponding to ρ = ρ′ > 0.

This allows one to get interesting stationary ﬁeld distributions, as static annular structures

(tori), or cylindrical surfaces, of stationary light (or electromagnetic or acoustic ﬁeld), and

so on, with many possible applications.∗∗ To realize this, let us initially start with the same

procedure in the previous Section; i.e., let us choose some desired longitudinal intensity

pattern, within the interval 0

z

L, and calculate the coeﬃcients An by using Eq.(10).

Afterwards, let us replace the zero-order Bessel beams J0(kρ nρ), in superposition (11),

with higher-order Bessel beams, Jµ(kρ nρ), to get

In superposition (17), the Bessel functions Jµ(kρ nρ), with diﬀerent values of n, reach

their maximum values at ρ = ρ′

n = 0. The values of ρ′

n are located around the central value ρ′

n=0, at

which the Bessel function Jµ(kρ n=0ρ) assumes its maximum value. We can intuitively

expect that the desired longitudinal intensity pattern, initially constructed for ρ = 0,

will approximately shift to ρ = ρ′

n=0. We have found such a conjecture to hold in

all situations explicitly considered by us. By such a procedure, one can obtain very

interesting stationary conﬁgurations of ﬁeld intensity, as the mentioned “donuts” and

cylindrical surfaces, and much more.

In the following example, we show how to obtain, e.g., a cylindrical surface of sta-

tionary light. To get it, within the interval 0

Then, after calculating the coeﬃcients An as before,

we have recourse to superposition (17). In this case, we choose µ = 4. According to the

5.318/kρ n=0 = 8.47 µm, where 5.318 is the value of kρ n=0 ρ for which the

Figure 7(a) depicts the transverse intensity pattern for z = L/2. The transverse peak

intensity is located at ρ = 7.75 µm, with a 8.5% diﬀerence w.r.t. the predicted value of

8.47 µm.

In Fig.7(b) the transverse section of the resulting beam for z = L/2 is shown.

Figure 8 depicts the three-dimensional pattern of such a higher-order FW. In Fig.8(a)

19

the orthogonal projection of its 3D pattern is shown, which corresponds to nothing but

a cylindrical surface of stationary light (or other ﬁelds).

In Fig.8(b) the same ﬁeld is

shown, but from a diﬀerent point of view.

We can see that the desired longitudinal intensity pattern has been approximately ob-

tained, but, as wished, shifted from ρ = 0 to ρ = 7.75 µm: and the resulting ﬁeld resembles

20

a cylindrical surface of stationary light with radius 7.75 µm and length 238 µm. Donut-like

conﬁgurations of light (or sound) are also possible.

6 Generation of Frozen Waves

In the previous Sections, we have shown how suitable superpositions of Bessel beams

of the same frequency can provide impressive results: Namely, can produce stationary

waveﬁelds with high transverse localization, and with an arbitrary longitudinal shape,

within a chosen space interval 0

z

L; that is, Frozen Waves with a static envelope.

≤

≤

As we already mentioned, such waves are rather interesting, not only from the theoretical

point of view, but also because of their great variety of possible applications, ranging from

ultrasonics to laser surgery, and from tumor destruction to optical tweezers.

But how to produce our FWs? Regarding the generation of FWs, one has to recall that

superpositions (11), which deﬁne them, consist of sums of Bessel beams. Let us also

recall that a Bessel beam, when generated by a ﬁnite aperture (as it must be, in any real

situations), maintains its nondiﬀracting properties till a certain distance only (called its

ﬁeld-depth), given by

Z =

R
tan θ

,

(18)

where R is the aperture radius and θ is the so-called axicon angle, related to the longitu-

dinal wave number by the known expression cos θ = cβ/ω.

So, given an apparatus whatsoever capable of generating a single (truncated) Bessel

beam, we can use an array of such apparata to generate a sum of them, with the appro-

priate longitudinal wave numbers and amplitudes/phases [as required by Eq.(11)], thus

producing the desired FW. Here, it is worthwhile to notice preliminarily that we shall be

21

able to generate the desired FW in the the range 0

z

L if all Bessel beams entering

the superposition (11) are able to reach the distance L resisting the diﬀraction eﬀects.

We can guarantee this, for instance, if L

Zmin, where Zmin is the ﬁeld-depth of the

Bessel beam with the smallest longitudinal wave number βn=−N = Q

2πN/L, that is,

−

with the shortest depth of ﬁeld. In such a way, once we have the values of L, ω0, Q, N,

from Eq.(18) and from the above considerations it results that the radius R of the ﬁnite

aperture has to be

The simplest apparatus capable of generating a Bessel beam is that adopted by Durnin

et al.[7], which consists in an annular slit located at the focus of a convergent lens and

illuminated by a cw laser. Then, an array of such annular rings with the appropriate radii

and transfer functions, able to yield both the correct longitudinal wave numbers† and the

coeﬃcients An of the fundamental superposition (11), can generate the desired FW.

In the next Section we shall just consider such a simple apparatus, even if, of course,

other powerful tools, like the computer generated holograms, may be used to produce the

FWs.

6.1 A very simple apparatus for producing FWs

Let us work out an example, by having recourse to an array of the very simple Durnin et

al.’s experimental apparata.

Since 1987, let us repeat, it has been used a simple experimental mean for creating a

Bessel beam, consisting in an annular slit located at the focus of a convergent lens and

illuminated by a cw laser. Let us call δa the width of the annular slit, λ the wavelength of

the laser, and f and R the focal length and the aperture radius of the lens, respectively.

On illuminating the annular slit with a cw laser with frequency ω0, and provided that

condition δa

λf /R is satisﬁed, the Durnin et al.’s apparatus creates, after the lens, a

≪

waveﬁeld closely similar to a Bessel beam along a certain depth of ﬁeld. Within such ﬁeld-

depth, z < R/ tan θ, and to ρ << R, the generated Bessel beam can be approximately

≈

with Λ a constant depending on the values of a, f , ω0 and δa,

written

and

(20)

(21)

(22)

Thus, as Durnin et al. suggested, we can see that the transverse and longitudinal wave

numbers are determined by radius and focus of slit and lens, respectively. Once more,

let us recall also that the waveﬁeld has approximately a Bessel beam behavior (when

ρ << R), in the range 0

z

Z

R f /a that we have called the ﬁeld-depth of the

Bessel beam. Our FWs are to be obtained by suitable superpositions of Bessel beams. So

we can experimentally produce the FWs by using several concentric annular slits (Fig.9),

where each radius is chosen in order yield the correct longitudinal wave number, and where

Let us examine all this in more details. Suppose we have 2N + 1 concentric annular

slits with their radii given by an, with

N. Along a certain range, after the

are constants depending on the characteristics of the apparatus: Namely depending, in

general, on the values of a, f , ω0 and δa. It is possible to obtain a simple expression for the

Λn by making some simplifying, rough considerations[8]. The transverse and longitudinal

wave numbers are given by

and

On the other hand, we know from the present theory that for constructing the FWs

quantity β is to be given by Eq.(7):

Equation (27) yields the radii of all the annular slits that provide the correct longitu-

dinal wave numbers, needed for the generation of the FWs. We may notice that the radii

of the annular slits do not depend on the speciﬁc desired longitudinal intensity-pattern,

and that many diﬀerent sets of values for the radii are possible on making diﬀerent choices

for the parameter Q.

Notice that the procedure is not yet ﬁnished. Indeed, once the desired longitudinal

pattern F (z) has been chosen, one has necessarily to meet in Eq.(9) the coeﬃcients

An given by Eq.(10); and such coeﬃcients have to be the coeﬃcients of Eq.(23). For

obtaining them, it is necessary that each annular slit be endowed by the appropriate

transfer function, which regulates amplitude and phase of the Bessel beam emitted by

that slit. By using Eqs.(10,(11),(23), we get the transfer function Tn of the n-th annular

slit to be

Tn =

Finally, with the radius of each annular slit given by Eqs.(27) and the transfer func-

tions of each slit given by Eqs.(28), we do obtain a FW endowed with the desired longi-

tudinal behaviour, inside the interval 0

L. Of course, one has to guarantee also

7 Conclusions

In this work we have expounded the theory of Frozen Waves, and depicted some pos-

sible experimental apparata to generate them. The present results can ﬁnd applications

in many ﬁelds: Just to make an example, in optical tweezers modelling, since we can

construct stationary optical (but also acoustic, etc.) ﬁelds with a great variety of shapes;

capable, e.g., of trapping particles or tiny objects at diﬀerent locations.∗∗ These topics

will be reported elsewhere.

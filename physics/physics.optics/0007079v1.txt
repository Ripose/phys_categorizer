Abstract

The classiﬁcation of polarization elements, the polarization aﬀecting optical devices which have
a Jones-matrix representation, according to the type of eigenvectors they possess, is given a new
visit through the Group-Theoretical connection of polarization elements. The diattenuators and
retarders are recognized as the elements corresponding to boosts and rotations, respectively. The
structure of homogeneous elements other than diattenuators and retarders are identiﬁed by giving
the quaternion corresponding to these elements. The set of degenerate polarization elements is
identiﬁed with the so called ‘null’ elements of the Lorentz Group. Singular polarization elements
are examined in their more illustrative Mueller matrix representation and ﬁnally the eigenstructure
of a special class of singular Mueller matrices is studied.

Key words: Homogeneous, Inhomogeneous, Degenerate polarization elements, Eigenpolarization,
Lorentz Group, Quaternions, Singular Mueller matrices

Introduction

It is well known that [1, 2] polarization elements are characterized by the types of eigenpolarization that
they possess. Homogeneous polarization elements are the ones which possess orthogonal eigenpolariza-
tion whereas inhomogeneous polarization elements possess non-orthogonal eigenpolarizations. Here we
refer to a polarization element as a polarizing optical device which has got the Jones matrix or the
2× 2 matrix representation. Also, the term eigenpolarization refers to the eigenvectors of the associated
Jones matrix, the states which are unchanged in polarization by the action of the corresponding Jones
device matrix. There is another class of polarization elements that are called degenerate polarization
elements. They are the ones which possess only one linearly independent eigenpolarization.

Though the connection between the Lorentz group and polarization elements is well known [3, 4,
5, 6], little has been done in exploiting the known properties of the Lorentz group in identifying the
homogeneous, inhomogeneous and degenerate elements. Ours is an attempt towards this end and by
achieving this, we hope to have lessened the jargon to those who are familiar with Group Theory.

We recall here the connection between the set of all non-singular polarization elements and the

Lorentz group [4].

A non-singular pure Mueller matrix is of the form kL where L is an element belonging
to the Orthochronous Proper Lorentz Group (OPLG) SO(3,1), with k being any positive
real number.

Though the connection is always stated in terms of 4× 4 representation of the polarizing optical devices,
the so called Mueller matrix representation, and the group SO(3,1), the connection between the 2 × 2
matrix representation of the device (Jones representation) and the group SL(2,C) is obvious through
the homomorphism between the groups SL(2,C) and SO(3,1). In fact, there is a one-to-many mapping
between the set of all SL(2,C) matrices and the set of all Jones matrices, a Jones matrix being just a
complex scalar times a SL(2,C) matrix. This being the case, a classiﬁcation of SL(2,C) into homogeneous
and inhomogeneous elements gives us the corresponding classiﬁcation of non-singular Jones matrices.

2 Classiﬁcation of elements of SL(2,C) on the basis of their

eigenvectors

We know that among the elements of SL(2,C), we have those elements which are unitary and hence
correspond to the subgroup SU(2) of SL(2,C). The elements of SU(2) written in their quaternionic [7]
representation1 are given by

q0 + iq3 (cid:19)
Tr =(cid:18) q0 − iq3 −iq1 − q2

−iq1 + q2
where q0, q1, q2 and q3 are all real and q · q = q2
Tr has got two eigenvalues λ = q0 ±pq2
(i = 1, 2, 3), ˆa · ˆa = 1, where ˆa = {a1, a2, a3} is a real (unit) vector, we have λ1, 2 = exp± iθ
eigenvectors of Tr belonging to these eigenvalues are found to be
X1 =(cid:18)

0 − 1 and owing to the relations [7] q0 = cos θ

3 = 1. It is very easy to notice that
2 , qi = ai sin θ
2 . The

which satisfy X†1X2 = 0. Thus it is clear that all 2 × 2 unitary matrices, which are a complex scalar
times that of the elements of the group SU(2), are homogeneous polarization elements. These are the
so called rotators which is obviously so because of the known homomorphism between the group SU(2)
and the subgroup 1 ⊕ R3 of the group SO(3,1) with R3 ∈ SO(3).

(2. 1)

Similarly we consider another important set of elements belonging to SL(2,C). These are the 2 × 2
matrices (of unit determinant) which are hermitian and are represented in terms of a (unit) quaternion
q = (q0, ~q) as

with q0 real and q1, q2, q3 being purely imaginary. The eigenvectors of this matrix are found to be
2 , i = 1, 2, 3 we have

2 , qi = ni sinh θb

λ = q0 ±pq2
λ1, 2 = exp± θb

−iq1 + q2

q0 + iq3 (cid:19)
Tb =(cid:18) q0 − iq3 −iq1 − q2
0 − 1 and owing to the relations [7] q0 = cosh θb
2 . The eigenvalues of this matrix are given by
n3+1 (cid:19) ; X′2 =(cid:18)

X′1 =(cid:18)

n1+in2

n3−1 (cid:19)

(2. 3)

(2. 4)

where ˆn = {n1, n2, n3} is a real unit vector and X′1, X′2 are mutually orthogonal. We thus have no
hesitation in concluding that all hermitian 2 × 2 matrices are homogeneous. The angle θb is called the
boost angle because of the homomorphism that exists between hermitian elements of SL(2,C) and the set
of all boost matrices belonging to the group SO(3,1). The elements of the group SO(3,1) corresponding
to the hermitian elements of the group SL(2,C) being given by

Mb = A(Tb ⊗ T∗

b )A−1; A =

are symbols called the quaternion units satisfying the relations e
i = −1, (i = 1, 2, 3), ei ej = ek(i 6= j 6= k and i, j, k
cyclic. The quaternions over the ﬁeld of complex numbers are called complex quaternions and they form a group under
multiplication. A detailed discussion on quaternions and how they form a representation of the Lorentz group can be
found in [7]

the Stokes vectors corresponding to the eigenvectors X′1 and X′2 are respectively given by

′∗1 ) = {1, n3, n1, n2}, S′2 = A(X′2 ⊗ X

S′1 = A(X′1 ⊗ X

(2. 6)

S′1 and S′2 being the eigenvectors of Mb corresponding to the eigenvalues exp θb and exp(−θb) respec-
tively, the reason why these matrices are called diattenuators is obvious. They transmit the orthogonal
vectors (orthogonal in the usual sense, not in the Minkowski sense) S′1 and S′2 with diﬀerent amounts
of absorption (exp θb for S′1 and exp(−θb) for S′2). For the sake of completeness, we write down the
Stokes vectors S1 and S2 corresponding to the orthogonal eigenpolarizations X1, X2 of Tr. They are,

S1 = {1, −a3, −a1, −a2} and S2 = {1, a3, a1, a2},

(2. 7)

and it is to be noted that whereas X1 ∈ exp θ/2 and X2 ∈ exp(−θ/2), the Stokes vectors S1 and
S2 belong to the eigenvalues (doubly repeated) 1, 1 of Mr. The remaining two eigenvectors S3 and
S4 of Mr belonging to the eigenvalues exp iθ, exp(−iθ) can be seen to be complex 4-vectors thus not
corresponding to physical light beams. Similarly the eigenvectors S′3 and S′4 belonging to the doubly
repeated eigenvalues 1, 1 of the boost matrix do not correspond to physical light beams as both of
them are not Minkowskian vectors.

Having thus arrived at the conclusions that rotation and boost matrices are the homogeneous polar-
ization elements having orthogonal eigenvectors, we now wish to see which other elements of the Lorentz
group correspond to homogeneous polarization elements. To make this examination, we ﬁnd it useful
to recall the well-known polar decomposition theorem [8] realised in the case of the group SL(2,C). We
notice that any element T of the group SL(2,C) can be written as a product of a boost matrix Tb (or
T′b)and a rotation matrix Tr as shown below.

T = TrTb = T′bTr

(2. 8)

The eigenvectors belonging to Tr and Tb respectively being given by equation (2.2) and (2.4), it is not
diﬃcult to see that for T to possess orthogonal eigenvectors, one should have ˆa = ˆn. Also, by using
the quaternionic representation of the Lorentz group, one can very easily get at the general form of
the polarization element possessing orthogonal eigenpolarizations. Since the quaternions corresponding

to Tr, Tb are, respectively, qr =(cid:0)cos θr

2 , ˆa sin θr

2 (cid:1) and qb =(cid:0)cosh θb

multiplication of quaternions and using the condition ˆa = ˆn, we get at the quaternion q corresponding
to T, which is homogeneous. It is given by

2 , iˆn sinh θb

2(cid:1), by using the rule of

q = qrqb; q = (q0, ~q) ;

(2. 9)

One can very easily see that when θr = 0, q given above reduces to qb, the quaternion corresponding to a
boost and when θb = 0, q reduces to qr, the quaternion corresponding to a rotation. When both θr and
θb are non-zero, the quaternion which obeys (2.9) is the one corresponding to the general homogeneous
polarization element. At this stage, an observation regarding the classiﬁcation of the group SO(3,1)
depending on the geometic structure its elements possess, may be in order. We recall that [7] if an
element L = exp(S) of SO(3,1), where S is the so-called inﬁnitisimal transformation matrix of L, has
an additional structure with

S ≡ YeX − XeY;

eXY = 0,

X, Y being Minkowski 4-vectors, then it is called a planar Lorentz transformation. All other elements
of SO(3,1) which do not have their corresponding S in the form given above are called non-planar
Lorentz transformations. A corresponding classiﬁcation of the group SL(2,C), though this classiﬁcation
is signiﬁcant mostly in the 4 × 4 representation of the Lorentz group, is obvious. Also, depending
on the 4-vector character of the vectors X and Y, we have the so-called [7] rotation-like, null and
boost-like planar transformations. The quaternions corresponding to planar and non-planar Lorentz
transformations have been identiﬁed [7] and it is seen that ‘rotations’ and ‘boosts’ which are identiﬁed

3

to be homogeneous polarization elements are respectively special cases of ‘rotation-like’ and ‘boost-like’
Lorentz transformations [7]. But it is interesting to note that none of the other planar transforma-
tions are homogeneous. This can be seen by observing that the quaternions corresponding to planar
Lorentz transformations have q0 real as the only general condition on them, with their other quater-
nion components q1, q2 and q3 being permitted to take any values subject to the condition q · q = 1.
A careful observation of equation (2.9) reveals that the quaternions corresponding to planar Lorentz
transformations do not coincide with the form of the quaternion given in that equation (equation (2.9))
for any value of θr and θb except when either θr = 0 or θb = 0. The situations in equation (2.9) when
θb = 0 corresponding to the quaternion representing a rotation and the other situation when θr = 0
corresponding to the quaternion representing a boost, our assertion made above is proved. Thus, with
the set of all homogeneous elements in the Lorentz group being identiﬁed by equation (2.9), it containing
planar Lorentz transformations only in the form of rotations and boosts, the remaining elements corre-
sponding to non-planar Lorentz transformations, we can conclude that planar Lorentz transformations
with the exception of rotations and boosts are either inhomgeneous or degenerate polarization elements.
In the following we try to identify the set of all degenerate polarization elements in the Lorentz group.

2.1 Non-singular Degenerate Polarization elements

We start with checking the so called null elements [7] of the Lorentz group for their ‘degenerate’ ness.
The null elements of the Lorentz group are the ones which have their corresponding quaternion as

qn = (q0, ~q) ;

q2
1 + q2

2 + q2

3 + q2

0 = 1,

q2
1 + q2

2 + q2

3 = 0.

(2. 10)

One can easily check that for all elements of the Lorentz group having the quaternion of the above form,
the number 1 appears as the doubly degenerate eigenvalue. The eigenvector belonging to this doubly
repeated eigenvalue can be seen to be

X0 =(cid:18)

iq2+q3 (cid:19) ,

1
−iq1

(2. 11)

thus taking the null elements Tn into the class of degenerate polarization elements. None of the other
elements of the Lorentz group are degenerate as evidenced by the fact that only the null elements of the
group have doubly degenerate eigenvalues. This result and the discussions made hitherto make it clear
that the ‘null’ elements of the Lorentz group are the only non-singular degenerate polarization elements
(apart from a scale factor). Having thus identiﬁed the disjoint sets of the Lorentz group corresponding
to homogeneous and degenerate polarization elements, we can now conclude that all other elements
of the Lorentz group belong to the class of inhomogeneous polarization elements. Or to put it more
simply, the elements of the Lorentz group which have the corresponding quaternions other than the
ones mentioned in equations (2.9) and (2.10), correspond to inhomogeneous polarization elements.

It is worthwhile to point out here that all the examples of inhomogeneous and degenerate polariza-
tion elements that are quoted in [2] are singular elements though there is a whole lot of non-singular
inhomogeneous as well as degenerate polarization elements as we have pointed out here. In Table 1 we
give a few illustrative examples of homogeneous, inhomogeneous and degenerate polarization elements
which are non-singular.

3 Singular Mueller matrices

Having till now studied the eigenstructure and hence the classiﬁcation of non-singular polarization
elements, we now seek to determine the eigenstructure of singular polarization elements. It is to be
noted here that a class of the widely studied and used polarizing optical devices, the so called polarizers
and analyzers 2 are singular. Thus it is worthwhile to study their eigenstructure and eventually classify

them on that basis. Here we wish to work in the 4 × 4 representation of the devices only as it is
convenient mathematically for the task we have on hand.

We recall that singular pure Mueller matrices have the form

M = m00XeYG, where X = {1, x, y, z}; eXGX = 0,
Y = {1, −p, −q, −r}; eYGY = 0, and G = diag (1, −1, −1, −1) .

It can be seen that matrices of the form M = m00XeYG possess the following eigenvalues

λ1 = m00(1 + px + qy + rz), λ2 = 0, 0, 0.

(3. 1)

(3. 2)

Thus, there are only two distinct eigenvalues for M of the form (3.1) in general and a quadruply repeated
eigenvalue λ = 0 in the case where X = Y. Correspondingly, in general, there are two eigenvectors
S1 = X ∈ λ1 and S2 = Y ∈ λ2, the case of there being only one eigenvector Y ∈ λ = 0 getting
realized when X = Y. Since eS1S2 = eXY is the analogue of the expression X†1X2, where X1 and X2
are the eigenvectors of the Jones matrix corresponding to M in equation (3.1), singular pure Mueller
matrices fall into the class of homogeneous, inhomogeneous or degerate polarization elements depending
on the vectors X = S1 and Y = S2 on which they are built. They are homogeneous when eXY = 0,
inhomogeneous when eXY 6= 0 and degenerate when X = Y.

In Table 2, we give few examples of
homogeneous, inhomogeneous and degenerate polarization elements which are singular. One can also
see [2] for several examples of singular inhomogeneous polarization elements.

Though we do not have corresponding Jones matrices for singular Mueller matrices other than the
ones mentioned in equation (3.1), we ﬁnd it worthwhile to examine the eigenstructure of a special class
M of singular Mueller matrices which have the same structure as that of the singular pure Mueller
matrices, but the 4-vector character of the composite vectors X and Y are diﬀerent from that of
singular pure Mueller matrices. We have three cases to consider depending on the choices possible for
the 4-vectors X and Y.

(i) Here M1 ∈ M is of the form

M1 = m00XeYG, where

eXGX = 0,
eYGY > 0, and G = diag (1, −1, −1, −1) .

It is easy to see that this matrix has only one non-zero eigenvalue λ1 = m00(1 + px + qy + rz) its
corresponding eigenvector being S1 = X. The eigenvectors corresponding to its triply repeated
zero eigenvalue λ2 = 0 can be seen to be non-Stokes. It may be of some interest to note that this
matrix is the so called generalized polarizer matrix [9].

(ii) Consider a 4 × 4 matrix M2 where

eXGX > 0,
eYGY = 0, and G = diag (1, −1, −1, −1) .

M2 = m00XeYG;

(3. 3)

(3. 4)

This matrix also possesses only one non-zero eigenvalue It is easy to notice that M2 has a structure
equivalent to that of the transpose of M1. It has got two eigenvalues λ1 6= 0 and λ2 = 0 and the
corresponding eigenvectors are S1 = X ∈ λ1, S2 = Y ∈ λ2 = 0. The form of the above matrix
itself suggests that it belongs to the so called generalized analyzer matrix [9].
(iii) The only other remaining possibility in the choice of X and Y being eXGX > 0 and eYGY > 0,

we have

eXGX > 0,
eYGY > 0, and G = diag (1, −1, −1, −1) .

M3 = m00XeYG;

(3. 5)

On the same lines of that of the previous two cases, we can see that the matrix M3 has two
distinct eigenvalues, a non-zero eigenvalue λ1 and a zero eigenvalue λ2 = 0. The only eigenvector
corresponding to λ1 is X whereas the eigenvectors belonging to the triply repeated eigenvalue
λ2 = 0 are all seen to be non-Stokes vectors and thus not qualifying to be called eigenpolarizations.

5

We wish to make an observation here on the importance of studying the eigenstructre of Mueller
matrices. The eigenvector which correspond to a real eigenvalue of a given Mueller matrix represents
the physical light beam that comes out undisturbed by the polarizing optical device represented by the
Mueller matrix and hence a study of the eigenstructure of Mueller matrices, at least in the cases possible,
is welcome for understanding the nature of the optical devices represented by them. In fact, the singular
Mueller matrices that we have studied here is one class of Mueller matrices whose eigenstructure can
be studied quite easily. But there still remain a whole lot of Mueller matrices, singular as well as
non-singular, which remain to be examined for their eigenstructure. Among the class of non-singular
Mueller matrices, we have carried out a study of the pure Mueller matrices which are elements of the
Lorentz group (apart from a scale factor) and are in pursuit of other non-singular Mueller matrices
which are accessible for a study of their eigenstructure.

We demonstrate that nonlinear directional coupler with special bending of
waveguide axes can be used for all-optical switching of polychromatic light with
very broad spectrum covering all visible region. The bandwidth of suggested
device is enhanced ﬁve times compared to conventional couplers. Our results
suggest novel opportunities for creation of all-optical logical gates and switches
for polychromatic light with white-light and super-continuum spectrum.

Directional waveguide coupler ﬁrst introduced by
Jensen1 and Maier2 has attracted a great deal of at-
tention as a major candidate for creation of ultra-fast
all-optical switches. This device utilizes light tunneling
between two optical waveguides placed in close proxim-
ity to each other, as schematically shown in Fig. 1(a). In
the linear regime, light is switched from one to another
waveguide at the distance called coupling length. At high
input powers, intensity-dependent change of the refrac-
tive index through optical nonlinearity creates detuning
between the waveguides which can suppress power trans-
fer between coupler arms, such that light remains in the
input waveguide. Since the ﬁrst experimental demon-
stration of a subpicosecond nonlinear coupler switch in
a dual-core ﬁber3, various aspects of switching in dif-
ferent coupler conﬁgurations has been extensively ana-
lyzed4,5,6,7,8.

In recent years, new sources of light with ultra-broad
spectrum became available, having a wide range of appli-
cations including information transmission, spectroscopy,
microscopy, and optical sensing. However, conventional
coupler can only perform switching of signals with rather
limited spectral bandwidth, because the coupling length
depends on optical frequency resulting in separation of
diﬀerent frequency components between the waveguides.
In this Letter, we propose a new conﬁguration of direc-
tional coupler designed for nonlinear switching of poly-
chromatic light, such as light with supercontinuum fre-
quency spectrum generated in photonic-crystal ﬁbers and
ﬁber tapers9,10. The spectral bandwidth of suggested de-
vice is ﬁve times wider compared to conventional coupler
structures, making it possible to collectively switch wave-
lengths covering almost all visible region.

We demonstrate that the operating bandwidth of con-
ventional coupler consisting of straight parallel waveg-
uides [Fig. 1(a)] can be improved by introducing spe-
cial bending of waveguide axes in the propagation di-
rection as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). Nonlinear switching
of polychromatic signals while preserving their spectral
characteristics can be realized in media with slow non-
linear response, where the optically-induced refractive in-

the red spectral edge, see Fig. 1(c).

The eﬀect of axes bending on light propagation in two
coupled waveguides can be described in terms of the ef-
It was shown14 that,
fective coupling coeﬃcient Ceﬀ .
in the limit when bending period is smaller than the
coupling length for straight waveguides, the light distri-
bution at the output of the curved coupler is the same
as for straight structure with the coupling Ceﬀ between
the waveguides. For bending proﬁles consisting of sym-
metric segments with x0(z − ˜z) = x0(˜z − z), where ˜z
is a coordinate shift, the modiﬁed coupling coeﬃcient
takes the same form as in periodic waveguide arrays14,15
L
Ceﬀ (λ) = C(λ)L−1 R
0 cos [2πn0a ˙x0(z)/λ] dz. Here C(λ)
is the wavelength-dependent coupling coeﬃcient between
straight waveguides with the same separation a between
their axes, and the dot stand for the derivative.

We note that the integral in the expression for the ef-
fective coupling coeﬃcient depends on the wavelength λ.
This makes it possible to compensate for the wavelength-
dependence of the coupling coeﬃcient C(λ) with the ge-
ometrical bending-induced dispersion. In particular, we
can obtain almost the same eﬀective coupling in a broad
spectral range around the central wavelength λ0 by sat-
isfying the condition dCeﬀ (λ)/dλ|λ=λ0 = 0. We ﬁnd that
such wavelength-insensitive eﬀective coupling can be re-
alized in a hybrid coupler structure consisting of several
alternating straight and sinusoidal sections, x0(z) = 0 for
0 ≤ z ≤ z0, x0(z) = A{cos [2π(z − z0)/(L/N − 2z0)] − 1}
for z0 ≤ z ≤ (L/N − z0), x0(z) = 0 for (L/N − z0) ≤
z ≤ L/N , and x0(z) = −x0(z − L/N ) for L/N ≤ z ≤ L,
where N is the number of segments. An example of two-
segment (N = 2) structure is shown in Fig. 1(b). We
set A = ξ2(L/N − 2z0)λ0(4π2n0a)−1, where ξ2 ≃ 5.52 is
the second root of the equation J0( ˜ξ) = 0 and Jm is the
Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind of the order m. Eﬀective
coupling in this structure can be calculated analytically,
Ceﬀ (λ) = C(λ)[2N z0L−1 + (1 − 2N z0L−1)J0(ξ2λ0/λ)],
and condition dCeﬀ (λ)/dλ|λ=λ0 = 0 is satisﬁed for
2N z0L−1 = (cid:2)1 − (ξ2J1(ξ2)C0)−1C1(cid:3)
. Note that the
eﬀective coupling does not depend on N . Here the coef-
ﬁcients C0 = C(λ0) and C1 = λ0 dC(λ)/dλ|λ=λ0 charac-
terize dispersion of coupling between straight waveguides.
In our numerical simulations, we choose the central wave-
length at λ0 = 532nm, and ﬁnd the coupling dispersion
for waveguides shown in Fig. 1(a) as C0 ≃ 0.13mm−1 and
C1 ≃ 0.52mm−1. Then, we calculate the optimal param-
eters of the curved coupler, and obtain almost constant
coupling Ceﬀ (λ ≃ λ0) ≃ 0.31C0 in a broad spectral re-
gion, see Fig. 1(d).

The optimized curved coupler can be used to collec-
tively switch all spectral components around the central
wavelength λ0 from one input waveguide to the other
waveguide at the output. This regime is realized when
the device length is matched to the eﬀective coupling

In numerical simulations, we choose a large number of

of beams with broadband spectrum.

As monochromatic light propagates in a directional
coupler made of straight identical waveguides [Fig. 1(a)],
the power is periodically exchanged between the two
waveguides1. The period is deﬁned by the coupling
length, Zc = π/[2C(λ)], where C(λ) is the coupling co-
eﬃcient. Then, signal switching between output coupler
arms is realized by choosing the device length as an odd
number of coupling lengths. However, this condition can-

This causes switching from crossed state into the par-
allel state as shown in Figs. 3(a), (c) and (d). Re-
markably, nonlinear switching also takes place in a very
broad spectral region ∼ 450 − 700nm, which enables
the coupler to act as an all-optical digital switch for
polychromatic light.
In these simulations, we consider
the case of a photorefractive medium such as LiNbO3
where optical waveguides of arbitrary conﬁguration can
be fabricated by titanium indiﬀusion16,17. The photo-
sensitivity of LiNbO3 can be approximated as a func-
tion γ(λ) = exp[−log(2)(λ − λb)2/λ2
w] which has a max-
imum at the wavelength λb = 400nm and then drops
two times with the λw = 150nm shift to the red edge
of the spectrum as shown in Fig. 3(b). We have veriﬁed
that switching behavior of the coupler remains essentially
the same for diﬀerent values of λw, which primarily aﬀect
the quantitative characteristics of the coupler such as the
switching power.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that optimized curved
directional coupler can be used to perform switching of
polychromatic light with extremely broad spectrum cov-
ering almost all visible. Similar principles can be applied
to create broadband switches for other spectral regions.
Suggested devices can be fabricated in planar waveguid-
ing structures, oﬀering novel opportunities for creation
of all-optical logical gates and switches for polychromatic
signals with white-light or super-continuum spectrum.

length, i.e. L = π/ [2Ceﬀ (λ0)] ≃ 39mm. The accuracy of
the eﬀective coupling approximation increases for larger
N , and we found that the deviation from exact solutions
of coupled-mode equations14 in the vicinity of central
wavelength is less than 0.5% for N ≥ 2. Since bending
losses decrease for larger L/N , we choose a two-segment
(N = 2) structure conﬁguration [see Fig. 1(b)]. We
then perform numerical simulations based on full model
Eq. (1) and conﬁrm that the proposed coupler struc-
ture indeed exhibits extremely eﬃcient switching into
the crossed state simultaneously in a very broad spec-
tral region of about 450 − 700nm, which covers almost
all visible, see Figs. 2(b) and (d). This is in a sharp
contrast to the conventional straight coupler [Figs. 2(a)
and (c)] that can only operate in the spectral region of
∼ 510 − 560nm, which is about ﬁve time less than for the
proposed curved coupler. We note that slight decrease of
the output power at the red edge of the spectrum for the
curved coupler [Fig. 2(b)] is caused by the radiation at
the waveguide bends14, but such losses do not aﬀect the
broadband switching behavior.

At high input powers, nonlinear change of the re-
fractive index modiﬁes waveguide propagation constant
and decouples waveguides from each other similar to
other nonlinear coupler structures studied before1,3,13.

back-action

Cooling of a 58 MHz micro-mechanical resonator from room temperature to 11 K is demon-
strated using cavity enhanced radiation pressure. Detuned pumping of an optical resonance allows
enhancement of the blue shifted motional sideband (caused by the oscillator’s Brownian motion)
with respect to the red-shifted sideband leading to cooling of the mechanical oscillator mode. The
reported cooling mechanism is a manifestation of the eﬀect of radiation pressure induced dynamical
backaction. These results constitute an important step towards achieving ground state cooling of a
mechanical oscillator.

Cooling of micro-mechanical resonators such as can-
tilevers is an important prerequisite for studies rang-
ing from highly sensitive measurements of
forces[1],
displacement[2], observing quantum mechanical phenom-
ena of macroscopic objects[3] to gravitational wave de-
tection. Early work recognized the possibility to cool
a mechanical resonator mode by radiation pressure, via
use of an active feedback scheme[4][5], in close analogy
to stochastic cooling of charged particles. However, tech-
niques which cool a mechanical oscillator intrinsically via
radiation pressure, as routinely achieved in atomic laser
cooling- while proposed theoretically[6, 7, 8] - have never
been demonstrated. Here we report such a technique
based on radiation pressure[8] and apply it to cool a 58-
MHz micro-mechanical oscillator in the form of a toroid
cavity from room temperature to 11 K.

The present work falls within the setting of high ﬁ-
nesse opto-mechanical systems, which couple a mechan-
ical oscillator (such as a cantilever[9, 10, 11], an inter-
nal mode of a mirror[4] or a microcavity[12]) to an op-
tical cavity ﬁeld by means of a high ﬁnesse optical res-
onator as shown schematically in Fig. 1b. The motion
of the mirror renders the cavity transmission position
dependent. Indeed, the use of a Fabry P´erot interferom-
eter is among the most sensitive methods for displace-
ment measurements[6] and the underlying principle of
the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory,
LIGO. This monitoring however can become unstable
owing to radiation pressure, which can lead to regen-
erative oscillations of the mechanical eigenmodes as ﬁrst
predicted by Braginsky[13]. This phenomenon is a mani-
festation of the eﬀect of dynamical back-action[6, 14]. In
fact, while eﬀects of radiation pressure related phenom-
ena (such as bistability[15]) have been observed for more
than two decades; - and have been subject of various
theoretical studies[3, 5, 16] - the dynamical back-action
caused by radiation pressure has only recently been ob-
served in toroid micro-cavities on a chip[7, 12, 17]. These
toroidal microresonators[18, 19] (cf. Fig 1) possess ultra-

high-Q whispering gallery type optical modes while si-
multaneously exhibiting micro-mechanical resonances in
the radio-frequency domain. Due to the curved nature
of the dielectric cavity, the circulating photons exert a
radial force on the cavity sidewalls, thereby coupling the
optical and mechanical degree of freedom, analogous to
a Fabry Perot cavity with a movable mirror (Fig. 1b).
Owing to the resonator’s optical photon lifetime being
similar to the mechanical oscillation period, these devices
operate in a regime where cavity retardation eﬀects can-
not be neglected, which has enabled the study of radia-
tion pressure induced oscillations[7, 12, 17] and related
eﬀects[6, 20] in an experimental setting. While dynami-
cal back-action can lead to mechanical oscillations[12] it
can also as shown here lead to cooling of the mechanical
mode as predicted in earlier work[7, 8].

The mechanical mode under consideration in this
study is a radial breathing mode with resonance fre-
quency (fm = ωm/2π) of 57.8 MHz. Since the mechan-
ical mode is in thermal equilibrium with the environ-
ment (T =300 K), it follows from the classical equipar-
tition theorem that the mechanical oscillator undergoes
Brownian motion with a root mean square displacement
of hx2i1/2 =
, where kB is the Boltzmann con-
stant. For the present micro-resonator, whose eﬀective
mass is mef f = 1.5 × 10−11kg (as determined indepen-
dently by ﬁnite-element simulation) this amplitude cor-
responds to ∼ 5 × 10−14m. Despite the small ampli-
tude the thermally excited oscillations are readily ob-
servable in the transmitted light, when a cavity mode
is excited using a tapered optical ﬁber. Operating the
cavity detuned, the amplitude ﬂuctuations of the me-
chanical resonator cause a change in the cavity transmis-
sion that enables extraction of the mechanical resonator
characteristics (resonance frequency ωm/2π, line-width
γ = ωm/2πQm and displacement spectral density hx2
eωi
). Fig.2 shows displacement monitoring of the micro-
resonator obtained for varying power levels at a constant
red-detuning of the laser frequency ω/2π, with respect
to the cavity resonance, ω0/2π. The normalized detun-
ing ∆ωτ = (ω − ω0)τ , where τ is the photon lifetime, is
held at 0.5 for these measurements. From ﬁts to the
noise spectra at low pump power (10 µW ), the reso-

the motional sidebands of trapped ions). If the cavity is
pumped red detuned (i.e. ω < ω0 ), the cavity resonance
will suppress scattering into the red sideband, while en-
hance scattering into the blue sideband. This situation
is depicted schematically in Fig. 2c. This asymmetry in
the sidebands leads to a net transfer of power from the
mechanical oscillator to the light ﬁeld and causes cooling
of the mechanical resonator mode. The cooling power
can be derived by noting that the generated Stokes and
anti-Stokes sidebands produce a time varying radiation
pressure force, whose quadrature component upon red-
detuning can extract power (
dt FRP i ) from the
mechanical oscillator mode. The corresponding cooling

size that eﬃcient cooling is characterized by ωmτ ≈ 1 .
It is interesting to note that the physical process which
gives rise to cooling is analogous to cooling of atoms or

nance frequency of 57.8 MHz and an intrinsic mechanical
quality factor (Qm) of 2890 were extracted. The optical
line-width at critical coupling was ∼ 50 MHz, equivalent
to an optical quality factor of Q = ω0τ = 6.2 × 106 .
Strikingly, when increasing the power of the red-detuned
laser, a strong decrease in thermal displacement was ob-
served (Fig. 2, main panel). Concomitant a strong in-
crease in the mechanical line-width (damping) was also
observed (cf. Fig 2b), which in the present case can
be used to infer an upper limit on the eﬀective oscil-
lator temperature[4].
Indeed, we conﬁrmed that the
area underneath the Lorentzian noise spectrum reduces
by at least a factor × γ
(where γef f is the eﬀective
γef f
linewidth[4]) which is a further measure of the eﬀective
oscillator temperature (since Tef f kB =
ω
). For the highest pump power (∼2 mW at 970 nm), the
e
eﬀective temperature was reduced from 300 K to 11 K.
To substantiate our claim that indeed radiation pres-
sure is responsible for the observed cooling, a theoreti-
cal coupled mode model based on radiation pressure is
used[7] and compared to our ﬁndings. The oscillating
cavity (with frequency ωm ) produces both Doppler up-
shifted (ωAS = ω + ωm ) anti-Stokes photons and down-
shifted ( ωS = ω − ωm) Stokes photons (equivalent to

perature of the mechanical oscillator in the presence of
cooling is given by the balance of heating by the reser-
voir (hP i = ωm

dissipation theorem) and the radiation pressure induced
cooling rate[4]:

where ωef f is the mechanical resonance frequency in the
presence of the light ﬁeld. The presence of cooling thus
changes the observed line-width of the mechanical reso-
nances (γef f = γ+Γ) and causes a reduction in the Brow-
nian amplitude. In addition, the in phase component of
radiation pressure gives rise to a change in mechanical
resonance frequency ( ωef f = ωm + ∆ωm ):

To verify these additional theoretical predictions a series
of experiments were performed. First, the dependence
of the cooling rate Γ on the detuning was veriﬁed (eq. 1
and Fig. 3). For negative detuning a clear increase in the
mechanical line-width is observed (i.e. cooling) and for
positive detuning a decrease in line-width. Furthermore,
for blue detuning, regions exists in which the radiation
pressure induced ampliﬁcation rate exceeds the intrin-
sic mechanical dissipation rate(γ), leading to the regime
of parametric oscillation instability[7, 12, 17]. Using eq.
1 and leaving only the eﬀective mass a free parameter
(which agreed well with the simulated value), accurate
agreement with the experimentally observed change in
mechanical line-width (damping) was obtained (solid line
Fig. 3). This represents the ﬁrst experimental evidence
that indeed radiation pressure is responsible for the ob-
served cooling.

Next, the modiﬁcations to the rigidity of the oscillator
were measured. Eq. 3 predicts that for 1/τ > 2ωm a de-
crease (increase) of the mechanical frequency in the cool-
ing (ampliﬁcation) regime. However, if the cavity band-
width satisﬁes, 1/τ < 2ωm , an unexpected behaviour
is predicted; the oscillator frequency will increase when
cooled for small detuning, while for the remaining detun-
ing it is shifted to lower frequencies. These predictions
are in excellent agreement with the reported experimen-
tal results as shown in Fig. 3 . Keeping the same sample
but using a diﬀerent optical resonance with a line-width
of 113 MHz (57.8 MHz mechanical resonance), the tran-
sition to a pure negative and positive frequency shift in
the cooling and ampliﬁcation regimes was observed as
shown in Fig. 3b, conﬁrming the validity of our theoret-
ical model.

While prior work has already established that radiation
pressure is the dominant mechanism that drives mechani-
cal oscillations in toroid microcavities[7, 12, 17], measure-
ments were also carried out to assess the contribution of

order to quantify the thermal contribution at 57.8 MHz,
the response of the cavity to a modulated pump in the
frequency range of 0-200 MHz was recorded. This was
achieved by recording the shift in optical resonance due
to a modulated laser using a pump-probe scheme allowing
to diﬀerentiate diﬀerent path-length-changing contribu-
tions due to the thermal nonlinearities, radiation pres-
sure and Kerr-eﬀect based on their distinct frequency re-

agree well with convective heat exchange to the N2 envi-
ronment surrounding the resonator and thermal conduc-
tion to silica. For frequencies beyond 1 MHz, a plateau

appears which is due to the (instantaneous) Kerr non-
linearity as observed in prior work[12]. At 58 MHz the
radiation pressure driven mechanical response is observ-
able, which (inset Fig. 4) is a factor of × 260 stronger
than the Kerr nonlinearity in the present device.
It is
emphasized that this ratio is in quantitative agreement
with the theoretically predicted Kerr-to-radiation pres-
sure ratio. From the well-identiﬁed frequency response
of the aforementioned thermal eﬀects we can furthermore
conclude that their contribution to the interaction of the
cavity ﬁeld with the 57.8-MHz radial breathing mode is
at least two orders of magnitude too weak to explain the
observed eﬀects. Consequently, the response measure-
ments give unambiguous proof that such thermal eﬀects
contribute less than 1 part in 100 to the observed cooling
(or heating) rate.

In summary we have reported radiation pressure in-
duced cavity cooling of a radio frequency (57.8-MHz)
micro-mechanical oscillator. Given the recent progress
in high-ﬁnesse opto-mechanical systems it is reasonable
to assume that this phenomenon will become observable
in a wide variety of systems, and might provide a route
to achieve ground state cooling of a micro-mechanical os-
cillator. Acknowledgements: This work was funded via a

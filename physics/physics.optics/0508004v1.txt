ﬁbers

We report on what we believe is the ﬁrst demonstration of an optically activated cantilever due
to photomechanical eﬀects in a dye-doped polymer optical ﬁber. The ﬁber is observed to bend
when light is launched oﬀ-axis. The displacement angle monotonically increases as a function of
the distance between the illumination point and the ﬁber axis, and is consistent with diﬀerential
light-induced length changes. The photothermal and photo-reorientation mechanisms, each with its
own distinct response time, are proposed to explain the observed time dependence. The measured
degree of bending is consistent with a model that we have proposed which includes coupling between
photoisomerization and heating. Most importantly, we have discovered that at at high light intensity,
a cooperative release of stress results in cis-to-trans isomerization that yields a large and abrupt
length change.

INTRODUCTION

II. LASER INDUCED BENDING OF A FIBER

While the intensity-dependent phase shift of light in
a material is often studied, change in the length is not
usually considered; rather the intensity dependent re-
fractive index and absorption mechanisms are assumed
to dominate.
In this paper, we report the observation
that light can be used to induce a polymer optical ﬁber
to bend resulting in an optically activated cantilever.
Many mechanisms of intensity dependent length change
have already been discussed.[1, 2] Using the photother-
mal mechanism,[3] several devices have been demon-
strated including a tunable optical ﬁlter,[4] an all-optical
vibration suppressor[5, 6] and a mesoscale version of
such a device that exhibits both mechanical and optical
multistability.[7] In this paper, we show that diﬀerential
expansion can be used to make an all-optical cantilever
in a dye-doped polymer optical ﬁber, and we study its
mechanisms through modelling and experiment.

We begin by reviewing some of the more rudimentary
observations. This leads us to the development of our
coupled theory of the photmechanical eﬀect, which orig-
inates from photothermal heating and photoisomeriza-
tion. This section is followed by a set of experiments
that focus on measuring the parameters of the theory,
such as the intensity dependence of the time constants
and magnitude of bending as a function of pump inten-
sity. We ﬁnd that at low intensities, the theory does
not behave as expected, because the length decreases
rather than increasing with pump intensity. However,
above a threshold intensity, the length change becomes
abruptly positive and large – which is reminiscent of a
process in which internal stress builds until a threshold
is reached, after which the stress is released. So, we pro-
pose a hypothesis that collective interactions between the
molecules are responsible. We ﬁnd that our results are
consistent with this model.

When a laser beam is launched oﬀ-axis into a short
ﬁber made of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) that
is doped with Disperse Red 1 azo-dye (DR1), the ﬁber is
observed to bend. Fig. 1(a) shows a micrograph of a such
ﬁber when no laser beam is launched into it. The ﬁber
end and sides are aligned to a reticle grid as shown with
the three arrows prior to illumination. Fig. 1(b) shows
a micrograph of the same part of the ﬁber when a laser
beam is launched in from the right, and the arrow on the
right of Fig. 1(b) indicates the launch position. Relative
to the superimposed grid, the ﬁber’s length is observed
to increase by about half of a division and bending re-
sults in the ﬁber end moving downwards by almost a
full division. This cantilever is found to move back and
forth reproducibly between the two states when the light
is repeatedly turned on and oﬀ; so the phenomenon is
reversible.

The bending is caused by diﬀerential expansion be-
tween the illuminated and dark portions of the ﬁber. The
illuminated side expands more than the darker side, and
the degree of the bending depends on the distance of the
pump beam from the ﬁber axis. Fig. 2 shows the mea-
sured degree of bending as a function of the pump beam’s
distance from the ﬁber axis. As expected, the bending
angle increases linearly as a function of the axial beam
position when the pump beam is fully contained within
the ﬁber. When the pump is near the ﬁber edge, some
of the light propagates outside the ﬁber, leading to a de-
crease in the amount of bending.

III. THEORY

In this section, we develop a photomechanical theory of
heating and photo-reorientation mechanisms. This cal-
culation is not meant to be complete in that it does not,
for example, treat the full three-dimensional problem.

2

FIG. 2: The measured degree of ﬁber bending as a function of
the position of the pump laser, measured from the ﬁber axis.
The inset shows the ﬁber end and pump beam, approximately
to scale.

We assume that there are two mechanisms of light-
lead to photomechanical
molecule interactions that
eﬀects.
In the photo-reorientation process, photo-
isomerization results in a net distribution of molecules
along the ﬁber axis (i.e. perpendicular to the polariza-
tion) which leads to a stress along the ﬁber resulting in
a commensurate change in length.
In the photother-
mal process, the absorbed energy is turned into heat,
which results in thermal expansion. Since the photo-
isomerization process causes an orientational hole, the
amount of energy absorbed by the ﬁber drops over time,
so the photothermal process eﬃciency drops. In this way,
the two mechanisms are coupled.

As a zeroth-order approximation, we assume that
photo-isomerization is independent of the temperature
for the range of temperature changes expected for pho-
tothermal heating. In this case, the photo-reorientation
mechanism can be calculated independently of pho-
tothermal heating. The resulting orientational distribu-
tion of chromophores due to the photoisomerization pro-
cess can then be used as a source term in the photother-
mal calculation.

A. Photo-Reorientation Mechanisms

A full calculation of the mechanisms would require us
to consider a general orientational distribution function,
which even for the simple case of the photo-reorientation
mechanism alone yields complex results that require nu-
merical integration. We will therefore simplify the prob-
lem by eﬀectively using a two state model, that is, we
assume that a molecule can be oriented only in two or-
thogonal orientations: perpendicular or parallel to the
light beam’s polarization. We will also ignore the cis
isomer population and assume that it is small at any in-
stant of time relative to the population of the resulting
reoriented trans molecules.

FIG. 1: A photograph of an MPU (a) without illumination
and (b) with illumination. The three arrows mark reference
positions for identifying changes of the ﬁber position. The
white arrow indicates the position of the excitation beam.

Rather, the goal is provide a semi-quantitative frame-
work that is applied to understanding the observations.
To this end, several simplifying approximations are made.
These approximations can be understood in terms of the
following description.

Consider a polymer optical ﬁber with an embedded
isotropic distribution of one-dimensional chromophores
(such as DR1) in the trans state that undergo polarized-
laser induced isomerization to a cis state that is bent,
and therefore smaller. The orientational mobility of the
cis molecules will be much larger than the trans ones.
The trans molecules, oriented along the polarization di-
rection of a light beam, will have the highest probability
of optical absorption. As such, molecules that are ori-
ented parallel to the laser polarization will be converted
to the cis isomer, which subsequently will reorient due
to the higher degree of mobility and then decay back to
the trans state. The net result is that molecules oriented
parallel to the laser polarization will be depleted, and
converted to an anisotropic distribution, with the net re-
sult of a “hole” in the orientational distribution function.
Consequently, more molecules will be oriented perpendic-
ular to the laser polarization than parallel to it.

Under the above constraints, the approximations we

use are as follows:

1. The trans molecule interacts with light only if it is
oriented along the polarization of the light beam.

2. The trans molecule, after interacting with a photon,
leads to a trans molecule oriented perpendicular to
the photon’s polarization.

3. When the material is not illuminated, an entropic
process causes the system to relax into a steady
state equilibrium with equal populations for both
orientations.

We deﬁne the following variables:

• N - The fraction of molecules oriented along the po-
larization of the light beam. 1− N is thus the num-
ber of molecules perpendicular to the polarization;
and, N = 1/2 is the non-illuminated population.

• I - The intensity of the light.

• ξ - The probability per unit of intensity per unit of
time that a trans molecule will absorb light and be
converted to the perpendicular orientation.

• β - The entropic decay rate of an angular hole.

The population, N , can thus expressed as

3

The limiting forms of Eq. (4) are reasonable. When the
entropic decay rate is much larger than the rate of light-
induced reorientation (β ≫ ξI), then Neq = 1/2 as ex-
pected. If the decay rate β is small compared with the
reorientational conversion rate ξI, then all of the parallel
population is converted and Neq = 0.

When the light source is turned oﬀ, if the initial pop-
ulation is Neq and the decay rate is given by Eq. (1)
with I = 0, this yields a population N oriented along the
pump beam polarization of

N =

(1 − 2Neq) exp(−2βt)

where we have used Eq. (4). Note that Eq. (6) yields
N (t → ∞) = 1/2.

B. Photothermal Heating Mechanisms

In this section, we calculate the temperature as a func-
tion of time under the assumption that heat is trans-
ferred from the light beam to the sample through optical
absorption of only the parallel population. If the light
beam is turned oﬀ, we assume that the temperature fol-
lows Newton’s law of cooling. We deﬁne the following
parameters:

• T0 - The temperature of the substance surrounding

dN

= −ξIN + β(1 − 2N ),

(1)

the ﬁber.

• γ - The cooling rate of the ﬁber.

where (1 − 2N ) is the diﬀerence between the perpen-
dicular and parallel population fraction. Eq. (1) can be
integrated to yield,

N =

2β + ξI exp [− (2β + ξI) t]
2 (2β + ξI)

,

(2)

where we have evaluated the integration constant by de-
manding that N (t = 0) = 1/2. Note that we can also
express this result in a way that better shows the form
of the exponential growth,

N =

1
2 (cid:20)

1 −

ξI
(2β + ξI)

(1 − exp [− (2β + ξI) t])
(cid:21)

.

(3)

There are several points about this result that need
to be mentioned. First, at inﬁnite time, the equilibrium
population is:

and the conversion rate of reorientation is intensity de-
pendent and of the form,

Neq =

β
2β + ξI

,

δ(I) = 2β + ξI.

• α - The temperature increase per trans molecule
parallel to the beam’s polarization per unit of in-
tensity per unit of time. Clearly, α depends on the
concentration of dopants.

The heating rate of a ﬁber under illumination is then

given by,

dT
dt

= −γ(T − T0) + αN I,

(7)

where the ﬁrst term is the Newton cooling rate and the
second term represents energy deposited through optical
absorption. When the light is turned oﬀ, the cooling
process is described by:

dT
dt

= −γ(T − T0).

(8)

Clearly, the constant γ depends on the ﬁber geometry
and its speciﬁc heat.

a). Light-on → illumination process

We begin by considering the heating process. Substi-

tuting Eq. (3) in Eq. (7) and using Eq. (5), we get:

(10)
where the ﬁrst term on the righthand side is the homoge-
nous solution with integration constant A and the rest of
the expression is the inhomogeneous term. To ﬁnd A we
demand that at t = 0 the ﬁber is in thermal equilibrium
with its surroundings so that T = T0. This yields,

b). Light-oﬀ → decay process

Next, we solve for the cooling process, give by Eq. (8).

This yields,

T − T0 = B exp(−γt),

(13)

where B is an integration constant. The typical experi-
mental sequence consists of turning on the light source,
waiting until the ﬁber reaches equilibrium (i.e. t → ∞),
then turning oﬀ the light source. As such, we choose the
temperature diﬀerence T −T0 at t = 0 as the temperature
diﬀerence from Eq. (12) at inﬁnite time, or

T − T0 =

αβ
δγ (cid:19)

(14)

C. Photomechanical Response

We are now ready to formulate the photomechanical re-
sponse. First, we consider the photo-reorientation mech-
anism. When a molecule reorients away from the laser’s
polarization axis, the strain along that axis should de-
crease and the strain perpendicular to it should increase.
So, the fractional length change, ∆L/L (where L is ﬁber
length and ∆L is its change caused by the photomechan-
ical eﬀect) should be proportional to the diﬀerence be-
tween the fraction of molecules oriented away from the
polarization and those parallel to it,

∆L
L

= b [(1 − N ) − N ] = b (1 − 2N ) ,

(16)

4

FIG. 3: A schematic diagram of the relationship between the
length change and degree of bending.

where b is what we call the isomer-mechanical constant,
which depends on the properties of the polymer and
dopant molecules. Note that the length changes if the
dopant molecules deviate from their isotropic distribu-
tion of N = 1/2.

In the photothermal mechanism, the length changes
due to thermal expansion. For a coeﬃcient of thermal
expansion αt, and assuming additivity between the two
mechanisms, the total length change is given by

∆L
L

= b (1 − 2N ) + αt (T − T0) .

(17)

Next, we need to determine the relationship between
the fractional length change and bending angle of the
ﬁber. As stated above, if the temperature is higher on
one side of the ﬁber, that side will expand, leading to
bending away from the hot side. Fig. 3 illustrates a bent
ﬁber along with the parameters we use in the following
If the ﬁber is of length L before bending,
calculation.
we assume that after bending, the length of the ﬁber
along the non-illuminated side remains L. If the length
increase of the illuminated side of the ﬁber is ∆L, we see
from Fig. 3 that

θ =

L + ∆L
R + d

(18)

where ǫ = L/d is the length-to-diameter ratio of the can-
tilever.

We can thus calculate the dynamics of the photome-
chanical process as photoinduced bending of a ﬁber by
substituting ∆L/L in Eq. (18) into Eq. (17) using the ap-
propriate expression for the number fraction N and the
temperature diﬀerence T − T0 from the previous section.

a). Light-on → illumination process

We begin by considering the pump illumination pro-
cess. Substituting Equations (3) and (12) into (17), and
the result into Eq. (18), the change in angle due to the
photoisomerization and photoheating mechanisms, θr, is

Note that we have combined terms with the same time
constant. Finally, we substitute Eq. (5) into Eq. (19) to
get the result in terms of the material parameters,

Each process has associated with it a characteristic time

slower process, so we label that term the slow process
and the heating process term the fast process.

b). Light-oﬀ→ decay process

Similarly, for the decay process when the pump illumi-
nation is oﬀ, we substitute Eq. (6) and (15) into Eq. (17)
and the result into Eq. (18). This yields the angle, θd, as
a function of time in a dark ﬁber,

IV. EXPERIMENT

To systematically study the photomechanical eﬀects,
an experimental setup schematically shown in Fig. 4 is

or bending of an MPU aﬀects the measured power at the
detector.

adopted. The ﬁber used in this experiment is made of
PMMA that is uniformly doped with 1% (by weight) DR1
dye. The diameter of the ﬁber is 600 µm and the length
is 2.6 mm, yielding an aspect-ratio given by ǫ = 4.33.
The ﬁber’s absorption coeﬃcient is α = 0.3 mm−1 at the
wavelength λ = 633 nm, at which the excitation laser
operates. We call such ﬁbers mesoscale photomechani-
cal units (MPUs). Details of the fabrication process for
making an MPU can be found in the literature.[3, 5, 7]
The MPU cantilever is polished on both ends, and
one end is attached to a glass substrate with transpar-
ent cyanoacrylate adhesive. A small piece of a metalized
glass cover slip is bonded to the other end and functions
as a lightweight mirror. A beam from a He-Ne laser,
called the pump beam, is coupled into the ﬁber though
the substrate. The pump laser beam is focused by a lens
and the MPU is located just beyond the focal point, so
the spot size of the laser on the input end face of the
ﬁber is estimated to be ∼ 150 µm. An electronic shut-
ter is used to control or modulate the light. A second
laser beam, which we call the probe beam, is incident on
the MPU’s mirror and the reﬂections from the mirror is
directed onto an opaque plate with a narrow slit behind
which a photodetector is placed. A cylindrical lens is in-
serted between the MPU mirror and detector (see Fig. 4)
to expand the probe beam on the opaque plate thereby
increasing the spatial resolution of the slit/detector pair.
The pump beam is set oﬀ axis near the edge of the ﬁber
for maximum deﬂection. Also, the pump laser beam is
oﬀset horizontally from the ﬁber axis so that the induced
MPU bending occurs in the plane of the table (i.e.
in
the plane of the page in Fig. 4) and therefore the move-
ment of the probe laser beam is perpendicular to the slit
on the opaque plate. Both pump and probe lasers are
He-Ne lasers operating at λ = 633 nm.

Fig. 5 shows how the change in length and bending
aﬀects the beam. Clearly, the oﬀset of the beam due to
a length change is independent of the distance between
the MPU’s mirror and the detector while bending leads
to larger deﬂections when the distance is made larger.

The change of the detected power due to bending thus
depends on this distance and the intensity proﬁle of the
laser beam. The greatest sensitivity is achieved when
the slit is placed at the point of highest intensity gra-
dient in the beam. Furthermore, the dynamic range of
deﬂections that can be measured depends on the beam
diameter. Dynamic range is therefore inversely related to
the sensitivity. In our experiments, the intensity distri-
bution of the probe laser beam is Gaussian. We choose
the beam size, focal length of the cylindrical lens, power
range of the pump laser, and the slit position such that
only the left half (expanded by the cylindrical lens) of
the Gaussian beam translates across the slit for the full
range of laser-induced MPU deﬂection. The detector is
placed far enough away from the cantilever to increase
the sensitivity of detecting bending while minimizing the
eﬀect of length change. The output of the detector is fed
to a digital oscilloscope in which the experimental data
can be saved. In our setup, we have veriﬁed that the de-
tected power change due to the MPU’s length change is
much smaller than that caused by bending of the MPU.
Therefore, the power change measured by the detector
reﬂects mainly the eﬀects of bending.

The apparatus is calibrated to determine the de-
gree of angular deﬂection per unit of power change of
the probe beam. To do so, the MPU assembly (sub-
strate/MPU/mirror) is placed on a rotation stage with
a rotation angle resolution of 0.017o. The sample is ro-
tated in small, well calibrated angular increments and the
power is measured in units of detector voltage. Fig. 6
shows the data and a polynomial ﬁt. This calibration
polynomial is used to convert the measured probe beam
power into a bending angle of the cantilever. Note that
above a deﬂection angle of 0.1o, the displacement of the
beam spot at the detector plane is larger than the beam
diameter, and therefore beyond the detectable range of
the slit/detector combination. As such, our experiment
is limited to deﬂection angles of less than 0.1o.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The temporal response of the cantilever is obtained by
measuring the power at the detector as a function of time
after the shutter is opened or closed. Fig. 7 shows the out-
put of the detector when the shutter is opened and closed
repeatedly, which illustrates that the ﬁber moves repro-
ducibly back and forth. Fig. 8 shows a typical plot of the
deﬂection angle (converted from the measured power at
the detector by using the calibration polynomial obtained
from the ﬁt shown in Fig. 6) as a function of time after
the shutter is opened for a 12.7 W/cm2 pump intensity.
Here we have used an estimated average pump beam di-
ameter of 200 µm inside the MPU. We call the process
while the shutter is open a rise process. Fig. 9 shows a
continuation of Fig. 8 when the shutter is closed, which
we call a decay process. The characteristics of these re-
sponses are as follows. They can be well ﬁt to Eq. (20)
and (21) respectively, with two diﬀerent time constants,

as shown by the gray curves in Figs. 8 and 9 (all ﬁt pa-
rameters are shown as insets). This indicates that there
are two mechanisms that are responsible for the response
as modelled by our theory. Furthermore, the two expo-
nential components have opposite signs (there are a few
exceptions in the rise data, which we will discuss below).
According to Eq. (20) and (21), it can be concluded that

b < 0.

This implies, according to Eq. (16), that the bending
component caused by the photo-reorientation mechanism
is negative, or, photoisomerization yields a decrease in
the ﬁber length.

after the shutter is opened; and, once equilibrium is
reached, after the shutter is closed, at several pump in-

tensities in the range of 3.2 W/cm2 to 16.9 W/cm2. Equa-
tions (20) and (21) are used to ﬁt these data. As such,
we obtain the power dependence of the physical param-
eters in our theoretical model, such as the equilibrium
steady-state bending angle (Fig. 10); the rise and decay
time constants for the fast and slow mechanisms (Figs. 11
and 12); and the amplitude of the rise and decay process
for the fast and slow mechanisms (Fig. 13 and 14). In
Fig. 10, for intensities above 17W/cm2, the deﬂection an-
gles were measured by observing the reﬂected spot on a
screen and determining the angle trigonometrically. Any
Intensity above 17W/cm2 corresponds to a deﬂection an-
gle greater than 0.1o, which is beyond the range of the
calibrated slit/detector pair.

According to our theory, the rate, γ, for heating and
cooling are the same and independent of the intensity for
the rise and decay processes (see Eq. (20) and (21)). In
contrast, the rates of photo-reorientation and its relax-
ation are diﬀerent in the rise and decay process, because
the former is power dependent (i.e. due to the term
2β + ξI in Eq. (20)) and the latter is power indepen-
dent (see Eq. (21)). Therefore, the hypothesis that the
two time constants are diﬀerent for the photoisomeriza-
tion processes is relatively simple to test with intensity-
dependent studies of the slow mechanism.

By comparing the data in Figs. 11 and 12, we ﬁnd
that within experimental uncertainty, only a weak in-
tensity dependence is observed. Under some conditions,
response times on the order of seconds in the photo-
reorientation phenomenon have been reported in the
literature.[8, 9, 10, 11] However, since the time constant
depends on the material composition and intensity, it is
not a straightforward matter to determine the time con-
stant that one would expect in our experiments.

To determine which time constant corresponds to
which mechanism, we calculate the thermal time con-
stant of the MPU using data from our experiments and
PMMA’s thermal properties from the literature.[12] The
calculation takes into account the geometry and mass of
the ﬁber and the material’s thermal properties (such as
the speciﬁc heat), and the result indicates a time con-
stant of about a few hundred milliseconds for our experi-
mental conditions, which is consistent with the fast time
constants we obtained (shown in Fig. 11(a) and 12(a)).
Therefore we infer that the fast process originates from
photothermal heating, and the slow process is due to
photo-reorientation.

An average of the response times in each set of data
in Fig. 11 and 12 gives a mean fast response time of
f = 0.113 (±0.005) s from the rise process and τ d
τ r
f =
0.109 (±0.003) s from the decay process; while for the
s = 3.36 (±0.30) s from rise data
slow process, we get τ r
s = 2.83 (±0.15) s from decay data (these numbers,
and τ d
except τ r
s , are labelled in Fig. 11 and 12). The fact that
the fast rise and decay time constants are independent of
each other and the equal within experimental uncertainty
supports our hypothesis that the fast process must be of
a photothermal origin.

In the following section, we extract the various param-
eters of our model by analyzing the dependence of the
data on time and intensity.

1. Heating — Fast Mechanism

From the data, an average rise and decay rate of γ =

1/τf = 1/(0.11s) = 9.01 (±0.16) s−1 is found.

9

(26)

2. Photo-Reorientation — Slow Mechanism

According to Eq. (21), the fast component of the decay

of the bending angle at t = 0 is

a). Decay process

The decay rate due to the entropic process of relax-
ation to the isotropic state is power independent, and is
determined from Eq. (21) to be

β =

1
2τ d
s

=

1
2 × 2.83 s

= 0.18 (±0.01) s

−1.

(23)

b). Rise process

The rise time constant originates from the competition
between intensity-induced excitation and entropic decay,
so is power dependent. Using the relationship between
the response time and the intensity from Eq. (20), the
rise time constant is

τ r
s =

1
2β + ξI

.

(24)

to this

Fitting the data in Fig. 11(b)
func-
tion yields β = 0.13 (±0.04) s−1
and ξ =
0.0044 (±0.0078) cm2W −1s−1. The value of β obtained
here from the rise data is 28% smaller than that ob-
tained from the decay data. However, they agree with
each other within experimental uncertainty. An average
of β = 0.16 s−1 will be used in following calculations.
But, we found that scatter in the rise data is relatively
larger, and χ2 of the ﬁt, which is the sum of the squares
of deviations of the theoretical curve from experimental
points, is 0.95. Therefore, the values obtained from this
ﬁt, especially the value of ξ, is subject to a large uncer-
tainty. This uncertainty can be further revealed in the
following analysis.

B. Amplitude

1. Heating — Fast Mechanism

a). Rise process

In our experimental conditions, we have γ − 2β >>
ξI; and from Eq. (20) the bending angle of the fast rise
process at t → ∞ is

θd
f (t = 0) =

ǫαtαβI
γ(2β + ξI)

.

Fitting the power dependence of the fast amplitude
component shown in Fig. 13(b) to this equation gives
the parameter αtα = 2.02 (±0.01)×10−2 cm2W −1s−1deg
and a negligible value of ξ ( < 10−11 cm2W −1s−1). The
value of the parameter αtα is in good agreement with
the one obtained from the rise process. The fact that ξ is
negligible is not surprising because the data in Fig. 13(b)
do not show any evidence of saturation, as predicted by
Eq. (26). Because the χ2 value of the ﬁt is 8.13 × 10−6,
it is much better than the ﬁt in Section V A 2b; therefore
providing a more accurate value of ξ than we obtained
in Section V A 2b. When ξ is negligible, Eq. (26) is the
same as Eq. (25), and both amplitudes of rise and decay
process follow a linear dependence on pump intensity.
The ratio of these two amplitudes calculated from our
experimental data is shown in Fig. 13(b) (open circles),
which demonstrates that the experimental data is con-
sistent with our theory.

2. Photo-Reorientation — Slow Mechanism

a). Decay process

The slow decay amplitude given by Eq. (21) is

θd
s (t = 0) =

ǫbξI
2β + ξI

.

(27)

Fitting Eq. (27) to the experimental data in Fig. 14(a),
we get bξ = −1.9 (±0.3) × 10−5cm2W −1s−1deg, and,
again we ﬁnd that ξ is negligible. Here we have used
an average entropic relaxation rate of β = 0.16s−1, as
obtained above. The χ2 value is 1.58 × 10−7, so the ﬁt is
good. Note that we kept the term ξI in the denominator
of Eq. (27) in our ﬁtting routine so that we could obtain
the parameter ξ and compare it with the corresponding
one we obtained in Section V B 1b.
b). Rise process

Since γ − 2β >> ξI, according to Eq. (20), the ampli-

tude of the photo-reorientation process is

θr
f (t = ∞) =

ǫαtαI
2γ

.

(25)

θr
s(t = ∞) =

ǫξI
2β + ξI

·

(cid:20)

b − αtαI

2 (γ − 2β) (cid:21)

.

(28)

Fitting the power dependence of the fast compo-
nent of the bending angle shown in Fig. 13(a) to this
equation gives the parameter αtα = 1.94 (±0.03) ×
10−2cm2W −1s−1deg. Here we have used the length-to-
diameter ratio ǫ = 4.33 for our cantilever.

b). Decay process

Since b < 0, θr
s should be negative. The experimental
data, as shown in Fig. 14(b), are negative at low power,
but positive at high power (i.e. the three open circles
are of the same sign as the bending angle of the heating
process). A hypothesis that explains the sign reversal
will be presented below.
If we ﬁt the negative data of
Fig. 14(b) only to Eq. (28), we obtain bξ = −1.2 (±0.1)×

10−5cm2W −1s−1 deg, which is about two-thirds of the
value we obtained from the decay process. In this ﬁt, the
parameter ξ, again, is found to be negligible; and so is
the second term in brackets in Eq. (28) in comparison
with b.

Our hypothesis for why the amplitude of the slow
photoisomerization mechanism starts out negative and
abruptly jumps to a large positive value above 13W/cm2
of pump intensity is as follows. We begin by arguing
why a negative angle is observed. To illustrate the im-
portant features of our physical picture, we consider only
molecules that are aligned along the direction of the po-
larization of the light beam since they are the ones that
are excited with high probability. Furthermore, it is well
known that the distribution of voids in a polymer vary
over a large range of sizes. For this part of our argument,
we only consider those voids that tightly ﬁt around the
molecule; and for convenience, assume that they are of
the ideal shape of an ellipsoid. Fig. 15(a) shows an illus-
tration of the initial states that are under consideration.
Both the ﬁber and microscopic view of the molecules are
shown. While the axes of the molecules are randomly ori-
ented so all orientations are equally represented, we only
show those molecules in Fig. 15 that are along the light’s
polarization direction. Also, we show only those voids
that are comparable in size to the molecular size (since
these are the ones that are responsible for the collective
process that we describe below) even though larger voids
are present. Note that we will discuss the role of larger
voids at the end of this section.

The negative angular deﬂection of the ﬁber is caused by
a decrease in the length of the illuminated side where the
polarization is perpendicular to the ﬁber axis, as shown in
Fig. 15(b). The light therefore causes the molecules that
are oriented perpendicular to the ﬁber (i.e. parallel to the
light’s polarization) to be excited to the cis state followed
by randomization of the orientation of these smaller cis
isomers. Subsequently, if any cis isomer decays back to
a trans state that is oriented along the light’s polariza-
tion, it causes those molecules to be re-excited. At higher
intensity, a signiﬁcant portion of the trans population
becomes depleted as shown in Fig. 15(c). Since the cis
molecules are smaller than the trans ones, we would ex-
pect a relaxation of the voids around the cis molecules,
accompanied by a decrease in the polymer’s bulk volume,
and therefore a decrease in the ﬁber’s length. To sum-
marize, at low intensities (below 13 W/cm2), our model
assumes that the process follows a sequence of events as
shown in Fig. 15(a)-(c).

We present the hypothesis that the abrupt transition
from negative to positive bend angle arises from a release
of internal stress due to the population of cis molecules
that are not otherwise conformationally able to relax
to the trans state (as shown in Fig. 15(c)). While the
smaller cis molecule may be able to rotate or tunnel into
a state with its long axis perpendicular to the cylindrical
void, it is diﬃcult for such a cis molecule to decay into a
trans state in this orientation. One can imagine that the

10

FIG. 15: Each frame shows a microscopic view of those
molecules that are aﬀected most by the light (i.e. we ignore
those molecules that are not along the light’s polarization)
and a macroscopic view of the ﬁber at a given applied ﬁeld
due to a light beam. The dashed lines show the original shape
of the material or ﬁber while the solid line shows the instan-
taneous shape. Note that E1 < E2 < E3.

cis molecule is being prevented from decaying into the
trans state, leading to an internal stress in the polymer
whose net direction is on the voids’ narrow surface (left
to right in Fig. 15(c)). We thus speculate that if enough
molecules accumulate aligned in the same direction in the
cis state, they cooperatively force the polymer to expand
along the narrow part of the void, relieving the stress
and allowing them all to collectively decay into the trans
state as shown in Fig. 15(d). The stress release yields an
increase in the ﬁber’s length as shown by the solid lines
in the diagram of the ﬁber in Fig. 15(d). The observation
of a small decrease in length at low powers (Fig. 15(c))
and a sharp change to a positive deﬂection angle at larger
power (Fig. 15(d)) is consistent with the picture that at
low power, the polymer shrinks because there are not
enough cis molecules to collectively overcome the inter-
nal stress barrier while at higher powers, the barrier is
exceeded.

For our hypothesis to be plausible, the concentration
of DR1 molecules must be large enough to allow cooper-
ative interactions between them. For the 1% by weight
concentration used in our studies, the mean distance be-
tween nearest neighbors is about twice the length of the
DR1 molecule. As such, it is reasonable to expect that
molecules near each other can mechanically interact with
each other using the polymer as a mediator: As one void

is deformed, the aﬀects are felt by nearby voids as the
polymer chains react by steric interactions.

We must reconcile this observation with the literature
on the measured refractive index change observed under
similar conditions. The universal observation is that the
refractive index change grows monotonically with time
and as a function of the intensity. Furthermore, the
measured birefringence shows that molecules are being
converted continuously to trans isomers that are perpen-
dicular to the polarization direction of the beam. This
observation appears at ﬁrst thought to be inconsistent
with our observation of a discontinuity. We reconcile this
apparent contradiction by arguing that the distribution
of sites in polymers provides a means for the same mi-
croscopic processes to result in diﬀerent observations for
optical and mechanical behavior.

FIG. 16: The process of trans-cis-trans molecular
re-
orientation in a void that is large enough to easily accom-
modate the new orientation.

The distribution of voids in a polymer is known to
be large. As such, we would expect that some of the
molecules are loosely held in place with voids whose
sizes are approximately equal to the length of the long
axis of the trans state while others are held tightly in
place by the smaller ellipsoidal voids. The loosely-bound
molecules can easily reorient to any direction in the trans-
cis-trans sequence. Fig. 16(a) shows a trans molecule in
such a void while Fig. 16(b) shows how the cis molecule
can freely rotate. So, we argue that these reoriented dye

11

molecules as shown in Fig. 16(c) will yield a negligible
stress, which can all be accommodated by small realign-
ment of the chains near the molecule without a global
change in the polymer’s shape. So, the reorientation can
be observed optically, but leaves no mechanical trace.
The tightly bound molecules, however, can only reorient
if the local free volume changes shape drastically, which
by virtue of the large conformational changes required of
the polymer, can only occur if there are global changes
in the polymer’s shape. Such global changes require the
collective action of many molecules as seen in Fig. 15(d).

VI. CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated diﬀerential photomechanical ef-
fects in dye-doped polymer ﬁbers. The optically-induced
bending of a ﬁber is governed by two mechanisms with
diﬀerent time response. The analysis suggests the fast
one is attributed to a photothermal process whilst the
slow one is shown to be related to polymer matrix de-
formation caused by polarized-laser-induced ordering of
the azo-dye molecules. More importantly, we ﬁnd what
appears to be a new phenomena that leads to photome-
chanical eﬀects: At high intensities, internal stress ap-
pears to build until there are enough molecules to cause
the polymer to reconﬁgure itself in a way that collectively
releases the stress.

Since our work has focused on the fundamental phys-
ical basis of the all-optically actuated cantilever, we
have intentionally studied systems with low dye con-
centration because of the resulting simpliﬁcations in
the modelling. A higher degree of bending is rou-
tinely observed in beams, plates, and ﬁlms[13] using iso-
merization in liquid crystalline materials[14] and shape-
memory polymers.[15] There are potentially many im-
portant applications that may result from miniatur-
ization of devices[15] such as nano-positioning, optical
switching,[16, 17] and beamsteering. The experimental
techniques and theory presented here can be used to
study new materials, design devices, and predict their
behavior.

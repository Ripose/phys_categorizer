Abstract

It is reported that when a light beam travels through a slab of left-handed medium in the

air, the lateral shift of the transmitted beam can be negative as well as positive. The necessary

condition for the lateral shift to be positive is given. The validity of the stationary-phase approach

is demonstrated by numerical simulations for a Gaussian-shaped beam. A restriction to the slab’s

thickness is provided that is necessary for the beam to retain its proﬁle in the traveling.

It is

shown that the lateral shift of the reﬂected beam is equal to that of the transmitted beam in the

symmetric conﬁguration.

INTRODUCTION

The left-handed medium (LHM) with negative permittivity and negative permeability

has attracted much attention [1–5] and triggered the debates on the application of the

left-handed slab as so-called “superlenses” [6–10]. Over 30 years ago, Veselago [11] ﬁrst

proposed that this peculiar medium possesses a negative refractive index, which has been

demonstrated at microwave frequencies in recent experiment [3]. In such media, there are

many interesting properties, such as the reversal of both Doppler eﬀect and Cherenkov

radiation [11], ampliﬁcation of evanescent waves [6], and unusual photon tunneling [12, 13].

All these phenomena are rooted in the fact that the phase velocity of light wave in the LHM

is opposite to the velocity of energy ﬂow, that is, the Poynting vector and the wave vector

are antiparallel so that the wave vector, the electric ﬁeld and the magnetic ﬁeld form a

left-handed system. Furthermore, the negative refractive index has lately been investigated

in photonic crystals at optical frequencies [14, 15].

It is well known that a totally reﬂected beam experiences a longitudinal shift, the so-called

Goos-H¨anchen shift, from the position predicted by the geometrical optics, because each of

its plane wave components undergoes a diﬀerent phase shift [16]. Recently, P.R. Berman [17]

and A. Lakhtakia [18] studied extensively the negative Goos-H¨anchen shift at an interface

between “normal” and left-handed media. In order to measure the parameters of left-handed

material, I.V. Shadrivov et al. [19] further investigated giant Goos-H¨anchen shift in reﬂection

from the left-handed medium. In addition, J.A. Kong’s group [20] elaborated the lateral

displacement of a Gaussian-shaped beam reﬂected from a grounded slab with simultaneously

negative permittivity and permeability. However, the behavior of the transmitted beam

didn’t draw as much attention as that of the reﬂected beam. Only J.A. Kong et al.

[21]

once discussed the lateral shift of a Gaussian-shaped beam through a slab of left-handed

medium with the given permittivity and permeability. They concluded that the displacement

is always negative, when the permittivity and permeability are both negative. More recently,

Li and his co-researchers [22–24] have investigated the lateral shift of the transmitted beam

through a slab of optically denser “normal” medium embedded in the air.

It was found

that the lateral shift can be negative, which is similar to the phenomenon taking place in

the LHM [3]. A question arises naturally: is the lateral shift of the transmitted light beam

through a slab of left-handed medium always negative?

2

The main purpose of this paper is to report that the lateral shift of the transmitted beam

through a slab of left-handed medium can be negative as well as positive. The necessary

condition is put forward for the lateral shift to be positive. The positivity of the lateral

shift is closely related to its anomalous dependence on the slab’s thickness, which means

that around resonance points, the absolute value of the negative lateral shift decreases with

increasing the thickness of the slab.

It is also shown that the lateral shift depends on

the angle of incidence and the refractive index. The numerical simulations are performed

for a Gaussian-shaped beam, in order to demonstrate the validity of the stationary-phase

approach. A restriction to the slab’s thickness is obtained that is necessary for the beam

to retain its proﬁle in the traveling.

It is pointed out at the same time that the lateral

shift of the reﬂected beam is equal to that of the transmitted beam in the simple symmetric

conﬁguration. Finally, we argue the previous opinion that the lateral shift is always negative

when the permittivity and permeability are both negative and suggest the explanation of

the positive lateral shift in term of the interaction of boundary eﬀects of the slab’s two

interfaces with the air.

HANDED SLAB

II. LATERAL SHIFT OF THE TRANSMITTED BEAM THROUGH A LEFT-

For simplicity, we consider a slab of left-handed medium in the air. Denote by a, ε,

µ and n, respectively, the thickness, permittivity, permeability and refractive index of the

slab, extending from 0 to a, as is shown in Fig. 1. An incident light beam of angular

frequency ω comes from the left at an incidence angle θ0 speciﬁed by the inclination of

the beam with respect to the x-axis. The ﬁeld is assumed to be uniform in the z-direction

(∂/∂z = 0) and time dependence exp(

iωt) is implied and suppressed. In the case of TE

−

polarization (TM polarization can be discussed in the same way), the electric ﬁeld of the
plane wave component of the incident beam is denoted by Ein(~x) = A exp(i~k
~k

~x), where
(kx, ky) = (k sin θ, k cos θ), k = (ε0µ0ω2)1/2 is the wave number in the air, and θ stands

·

≡

for the incidence angle of the plane wave under consideration. According to Maxwell’s

equations and the boundary conditions, the electric ﬁeld of the corresponding plane wave of

the transmitted beam is found to be Et(~x) = F A exp

i[kx(x

, where the amplitude

·

It is clearly seen that the real parameter χ can be either positive or negative. When the

medium of the slab is “normal” material, the parameter χ is positive. On the other hand,

when the medium of the slab is left-handed material, the parameter has the property of

χ < 0. Correspondingly, the phase shift (1) of the transmitted wave at x = a with respect

to the incident wave at x = 0 has quite diﬀerent behavior as compared with that for an

ordinary dielectric slab. Here we are concerned with the lateral shift of the transmitted

beam through a left-handed slab, instead of a “normal” dielectric slab.

When measured in the same way as the lateral shift of the reﬂected beam as is indicated

which is nothing but the lateral shift predicted by the geometrical optics, the Snell’s law of

refraction and is in agreement with the result of J.A. Kong et al. [21], who observed that the

lateral shift is always negative when the permittivity and permeability are both negative.

In fact, it will be shown that the lateral shift s can be positive as well as negative for a slab

of left-handed medium.

III. POSITIVE PROPERTY OF THE LATERAL SHIFT

It is seen from the expression (2) for the lateral shift that when the inequality

holds, the lateral shift is positive for χ < 0. It is reversed in comparison with the prediction

of Snell’s law of refraction that the lateral shift of the transmitted beam through a left-

handed slab would be a tan θ′

0, which is always negative. Since sin 2k′

x0a/2k′

leads to the necessary condition for the lateral shift to be positive,

(5)

This means that if the incidence angle satisﬁes the condition (5), that is to say, if θ0 is

larger than the threshold angle θt, one can always ﬁnd a thickness a of the slab where the

lateral shift of the transmitted beam is positive. To our surprise, the lateral shift of the

transmitted beam through a left-handed slab is similar to that of the transmitted beam

through an ordinary dielectric slab, predicted by Snell’s law of refraction. In this situation,

the positive lateral shift means the equivalent group index of the slab is positive, while

the phase refractive index is still negative for n =

√εµ. The inequality (5) shows that

−

5

positive lateral shifts are more easily implemented at larger angles of incidence because the

larger the angle of incidence is, the more easily the inequality is satisﬁed. As a matter of

fact, the inequality (4) is required for the lateral shift to be positive. Since the function

sin 2k′

x0a/2k′
of the order of π/k′

x0a decreases rapidly with increasing k′

x0a, the thickness of the slab should be
sin2 θ0)1/2], so as to make the positive lateral shift to

x0 = λ/[2(n2

−

be signiﬁcantly large. That is, the thickness a of the slab should be of the order of the

wavelength, λ.

permittivity, permeability and refractive index of the slab are chosen to be ε =

A typical dependence of the lateral shift on the slab’s thickness a is shown in Fig. (2),

where the permittivity, permeability and refractive index of the slab are ε =

1.89, µ =

0.58 and n =

x0a.

In order to obtain large lateral shifts, a large incidence angle is chosen to be θ0 = 84.5◦.

1.05 (θt = 74.0◦) at wavelength λ = 23.8 mm [5], a is re-scaled by k′

−

Calculation under these conditions shows that the lateral shift is equal to 67 mm (

2.8λ)

−

≃

for a = 40 mm and is even equal to 232.5 mm (

10λ) for a = 4 mm. It is interesting to note

that the oscillation of the lateral shift with respect to a is closely related to the periodical

occurrence of transmission resonance at k′

x0a = mπ (m = 1, 2, 3...).

Apart from the above-mentioned positivity of the lateral shift (2) of the transmitted beam,

it has other interesting properties at transmission resonance that deserving being pointed

out. When the transmission resonance occurs, the transmission probability expressed by

In this case, the lateral shift

When the condition (4) is satisﬁed, this derivative is more than zero. Therefore, we see

that under this condition the absolute value of the lateral shift decreases with increasing

thickness of the slab around resonance points, because the lateral shifts around resonance

points are negative. In other words, the positive lateral shift depends anomalously on the

thickness a of the slab around resonance points.

In addition, it is also indicated from Eq. (2) that the lateral shift depends not only on the

thickness a of the slab, but also on the angle θ0 of incidence and the refractive index n. To see

the latter more clearly, we draw in Fig. 3 the dependence of the lateral shift on the incident

angle θ0, where the thickness of the slab is a = 6λ, and all the other physical parameters are

the same as Fig. 2. Fig. 3 shows that the lateral shift decreases with increasing the incidence

angle θ0. It is seen that the peaks of the lateral shift are approximately determined by k′

x0a.

That is to say, the oscillation of the lateral shift with respect to the incidence angle also has

close relation with the periodical occurrence of transmission resonances. Furthermore, when

limit tends to zero in the following way,

It is meant by this equation that the local properties of φ′ with respect to ky are the same

as those of φ. So the lateral shift of the reﬂected beam is locally given by Eq. (2) [27, 28].

Because R = 0, at resonance, k′

x0a = mπ, the reﬂect beam disappears, and its lateral shift
has no deﬁnition in this case [24]. All these amount to a conclusion that when the resonant

transmission doesn’t occur, the lateral shifts of the transmitted and reﬂected beam are the

same in this symmetric conﬁguration when measured in the same way.

Of course, when measured with reference to the prediction of Snell’s law, the lateral shift

of the transmitted beam will be s

a tan θ′

0. Since the lateral shift a tan θ′

0 is less than zero,

when the lateral shift of the reﬂected beam is positive, the lateral shift of the transmitted

−

beam is even positive with reference to the prediction of Snell’s law, especially at some large

angles of incidence.

FIG. 4: Comparison of theoretical and numerical results of lateral shifts (in units of wavelength λ)

with respect to a, where the local waist of Gaussian-shaped beam is w = 5λ, all the other physical

parameters are the same as Fig. 2, and a is re-scaled by k′

x0a. The theoretical result is shown by

the solid curve, and the numerical results is shown by the dotted curve.

To show the validity of the above stationary-phase analysis, numerical calculations are

performed, which conﬁrm our theoretical results. In the numerical simulation, an incident

Gaussian-shaped light beam is assumed, Ein(~x)

Calculations show that the stationary-phase approximation (2) for the lateral shift is in

good agreement with the numerical result. In Fig. 4, we show such comparisons between

the theoretical and numerical results, where the local waist of the Gaussian-shaped beam

is chosen to be w = 5λ, and all the other optical parameters are the same as Fig. 2. It is

noted that the discrepancy between theoretical and numerical results is due to the distortion

of the transmitted light beam, especially when the local waist of the light beam is narrow.

The further numerical simulations show that the wider the local waist of the incident beam

is, the less the transmitted beam is distorted, and the closer to the theoretical result the

numerical result is.

As pointed out in Ref.

[23], for an incident light beam of the angle spreading δθ, the

corresponding spreading of k′

where λ is the wavelength of the light. With the angle spreading δθ = λ/πw for a Gaussian-

shaped light beam, we get

For instance, if the physical parameters are chosen to be n =

1.05, θ0 = 84.5◦ and w = 5λ

(corresponding to the beam divergence of δθ

4◦), the requirement (17) is calculated to

−

be a

11w. Clearly, this is compatible to the aforementioned requirement that the slab’s

≪

thickness should be of the order of the wavelength, λ. In addition, it is shown in Fig. 3

that the angular distance ∆θ0 between two adjacent peaks is determined by

∆k′

x0a
|

= π,

which gives ∆θ0 = π/(kx0a tan θ′

0). In order to retain the Gaussian-shaped beam’s proﬁle

in the traveling, the angular distance ∆θ0 should be much smaller than the divergence of

the beam, δθ. As a reslut, the restriction (17) is also required to be satisﬁed. In a word,

within this restriction the light beam can travel through the left-handed slab with negligible

distortion, thus the stationary-phase approach in this problem is of validity.

IV. EXPLANATION OF THE LATERAL SHIFT AND BOUNDARY EFFECTS

The previously discovered lateral shift of the transmitted beam through a slab of LHM

is negative, when the permittivity and permeability are chosen to be ε =

ε0 and µ =

µ0

−

−

[21]. On the basis of this result, the authors suggested that the lateral shift is always negative

when the medium of the slab is left-handed material. How do we understand the present

positive lateral shift? To this end, we rewrite the lateral shift (2) as,

s =

2χkx0ky0(k′2

(18)

which consists of two parts. One is a thickness-proportional term multiplied by a periodical

factor with respect to k′

x0a, which is always negative for χ < 0. The other itself is periodical.

From the lateral shift (18), we see that it is the second term that makes the lateral shift to

be positive. By averaging the two periodical functions over k′

x0a in one period π, we obtain

s = a tan θ′
0,

(19)

which is always negative. This is exactly what we expect from Snell’s law of refraction. This

may be explained as follows.

The negative refraction is inferred from the geometrical optics at a single interface between

the “normal” and left-handed material, which has been demonstrated in the experiment [3].

Moreover, the negative Goos-H¨anchen shift for the totally reﬂected beam results from the

interaction of the beam with the single interface of the LHM [17, 18]. When the light beam is

incident on the left-handed slab at an enough large angle of incidence, the multiply reﬂection

of the light beam takes place easily at the slab’s two interfaces with the air. This structure

is often analogous to a Fabry-Perot optical interferometer [30]: The two interfaces of the

slab with the air play the role of partially transparent mirrors through which the light is

coupled into and out of a resonant cavity. Here the periodical functions in Eq. (18) can be

considered as the result of the interaction of the boundary eﬀects of the slab’s two interfaces,

which contribute to the lateral shift. The averaging over k′

x0a just eﬀaces the interaction,

so as to ﬁnd the geometrical optic prediction. Actually, the positive lateral shifts presented

here can be understood from the physical viewpoint on the reshaping process of the light

beam by the interference of the multi-reﬂected beam in the slab.

When the parameters of the left-handed slab are chosen to be ε =

ε0 and µ =

µ0 [21],

−

−

11

the negative lateral shift can also be understood by the boundary eﬀects. In this case, the

left-handed medium is a perfect match to the free space and the interfaces show no reﬂection,

so that each plane wave component of the light beam can totally travel through the left-

handed slab. Therefore, the lateral shift of the transmitted beam without reshaping is always
negative. Mathematically, we can know from the Eq. (18) that the factors (k′2
x0)2
x0 −
and [k′4
µ0, so that

x0(1 + χ2)] are equal to zero for ε =

x0 + χ2k4

ε0 and µ =

x0k2
k′2

χ2k2

−

−

x0 −

the periodical functions resulting from the interaction of the boundary eﬀects don’t act on

the lateral shift. Therefore, the opinion that the lateral shifts are always negative when a

light beam travels through a left-handed slab with ε =

ε0 and µ =

µ0 is not qualiﬁed as

−

−

generality. From all these discussions, the lateral shifts of the transmitted beam through a

slab of LHM can be negative as well as positive, when the permittivity and the permeability

are both negative.

V. CONCLUSION

To summarize, we have investigated that the lateral shift of the transmitted beam though

a slab of left-handed medium can be negative as well as positive by the stationary-phase

approach. A necessary condition (5) is put forward for the lateral shift to be positive, which

is a restriction to the angle of incidence. The relation of the lateral shift with its anomalous

dependence on the thickness of the slab around resonances points is discussed. The lateral

shift also depends on the incidence angle and the negative refractive index. It is shown that

the lateral shift of the reﬂected beam is equal to that of the transmitted beam when they

are all measured from the normal to the interface (the x axis) at which the incidence point

is located. In order to demonstrate the validity of the stationary-phase approach, numerical

simulations are made for a Gaussian-shaped beam. A restriction to the thickness of the slab

is obtained that is necessary for the beam to retain its proﬁle in the traveling. The positivity

of the lateral shift can be explained in terms of the interaction of the boundary eﬀects of the

two slab’s interfaces with the air. Of course, the energy is conserved and the energy ﬂow can

be discussed by the approaches of Lai et al. [29] and J.A. Kong et al. [21]. Finally, it should

be noted that the possibility of observing the positive lateral shift of the transmitted beam

through an ideal, lossless and nondispersive slab of LHM presented here remains an open

question. However, with the advance of left-handed materials, we think, the lateral shifts

12

may have potential applications not only in the measurements of the physical parameters of

this material but also in optical modulations.

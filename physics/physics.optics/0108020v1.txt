Abstract

Volume free electron laser uses volume distributed feedback (VDFB), which can
essentially reduce the threshold current of generation and provides the possibility
of smooth frequency tuning. An undulator VFEL is considered.

1 Introduction

The advantages of distributed feedback (DFB) is well known in laser
physics. In conventional lasers DFB is formed in such a way that diﬀracted
and transmitted waves propagate along a line in opposite directions. The dis-
tinctive feature of volume free electron lasers (VFEL) is using of non-one-
dimensional (volume) distributed feedback at which the diﬀracted wave prop-
= π to the transmitted wave. Firstly the idea to use vol-
agates at the angle
ume distributed feedback (VDFB) for X-ray generation was proposed in [3].
VDFB causes sharp increase of ampliﬁcation and instability increment of elec-
ρ1/(3+s), where ρ is the electron beam
tron beam density is proportional to

density and s is the number of surplus waves appearing due to diﬀraction (for
example, in case of two-wave Bragg diﬀraction s = 1, for three-wave diﬀrac-
tion s = 2 and so on). This dependence essentially diﬀers from increment for
ρ1/3 [4].

Now the investigation of 4-wave diﬀraction in system with two-dimentional
DFB is also started by [5].

wavelengths. Explicit expressions VFEL threshold currents were obtained in
[7]. In present work the dependence of VFEL starting current on undulator
parameters is considered.

2 Generation and ampliﬁcation laws of undulator VFEL

It is well known that to ﬁnd ampliﬁcation and starting current one should
study the dispersion law of radiating system The set of equations describing
interaction of relativistic electron beam, which propagates in spatially periodic
structure in undulator is [7]:

α < 1 only small part of
electron beam interacts with electromagnetic wave. Setting the determinant
of linear system (1) equal to zero one can obtain the dispersion equation for
the system ”electromagnetic wave + undulator + electron beam + periodic
structure”. In case of two-wave dynamical diﬀraction this equation has the
following form:

on the system ends z = 0 and z = L. For Bragg geometry, when transmitted

In (5) the wave vector is represented as: k = k0 + ω
c δ, where k0 satisﬁes
undulator synchronism condition. The boundary conditions (5) are written
for the ”cold” electron beam. In this case the dispersion equation has four
roots (δi, i = 1
4). The ﬁrst and the fourth conditions in (5) correspond
to continuity of transmitted wave at z = 0 and diﬀracted wave at boundary
z = L (it is supposed that the wave with wave vector ~k and amplitude a is
falling on boundary z = 0 and the wave with wave vector ~k1 and amplitude b is
falling on boundary z = L). The second and the third conditions in (5) accord
with the requirement that the electron beam is unpertubed before entering the
interaction region. The part of electron beam energy converting to radiation
can be expressed as:

generation from generation process in conventional undulator FEL. The latter

This diﬀerence ensues from interference of contribution to radiation of two
diﬀraction roots. From (6) follows that: 1. the starting current in case of two-
wave diﬀraction is proportional to jstart ∼
2. non-one dimensional VDFB provides the possibility to decrease the starting
current of generation by varying of the angles between the waves. The depen-
dence of Γstart(β)/Γstart(β = 0) on asymmetry factor β is presented in ﬁg.2.

The conventional FEL gain is proportional to (kL)3 [4], but as follows from (7)
2
in case of two-wave diﬀraction the gain gets an additional factor
,
which noticeably exceeds the unity in conditions of dynamical diﬀraction.
Such increase of radiation output in degeneration point can be explained by
the reduction of wave group velocity, which can be written as:

It follows from (8) that for multi-wave dynamical diﬀraction in the s-fold-
(kL)−3(kχ1L)−2s
degeneration point vg ∼
and ampliﬁcation is proportional to (kL)3(kχ1L)2s. It should be noted that
considered eﬀects take place in wide spectral range for wavelengths from cen-
timeters to X-ray ([3,6–9]) and inﬂuence of eﬀect increases with the frequency
growth.

The generation threshold in undulator VFEL in case of VDFB can be achived
at lower electron beam current and shorter undullator length when special
conditions of roots degeneration are fulﬁlled. Change of VDFB conditions by
varying the volume geometry parameters (for example, the angle between wave
vectors) gives the possibility to increase Q-factor and decrease starting current
(see ﬁg. 2) and, hence, the eﬃciency of generation can be increased.

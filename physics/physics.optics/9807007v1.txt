Abstract

It was noticed in the past that, to avoid physical inconsistencies, in Marcatili’s lossless

tapers through-ﬂowing waves must be drastically diﬀerent from standing waves. First,

we reconﬁrm this by means of numerical results based on an extended BPM algorithm.

Next, we show that this apparently surprising behavior is a straightforward fallout of

Maxwell’s equations. Very similar remarks apply to Gaussian beams in a homogeneous

medium. As a consequence, Gaussian beams are shown to carry reactive powers, and

their active power distributions depart slightly from their standard pictures. Similar

conclusions hold for free-space modes expressed in terms of Bessel functions.

Introduction.

In 1985, Marcatili infringed a historical taboo, showing that one can conceive and design,

at least on paper, dielectric tapers and bent waveguides that are strictly lossless [1]. The

key feature, shared by the inﬁnitely many structures which obey Marcatili’s recipe, is that

the phase fronts of their guided modes are closed surfaces. Phase fronts which extend to

inﬁnity in a direction orthogonal to that of propagation entail radiation loss: closed fronts

can overcome this problem. Shortly later, however, it was pointed out that this recipe could

generate some incosistencies [2]. In fact, a traveling wave with a closed phase front is either

exploding from a point, or a line, or a localized surface, or collapsing onto such a set. In a

lossless medium and in the absence of sources or sinks, this picture is untenable. On the other

hand, it was also pointed out in ref.[2] that a standing wave with closed constant-amplitude

surfaces is perfectly meaningful under a physical viewpoint. Therefore, a through-ﬂowing

wave through any of Marcatili’s lossless tapers or bends has to be described in this way: the

incoming wave must be decomposed as the sum of two standing waves, of opposite parity

with respect to a suitable symmetry plane (or, more generally, surface). The output wave is

then found as the sum of the values taken by the two standing waves at the other extremity

of the device. Another point raised in ref.[2] was that very similar remarks apply to Gaussian

beams in free space. If applied literally to a traveling wave, the standard mathematics which

is found in any textbook on Gaussian beams would entail that such beams either explode

from their waist plane or implode from it: once again, a physically meaningless picture.

Later on, the literature showed that these problems were not dealt with for a long time.

Recently, though, we observed several symptoms of a renewed interest in low-loss [3, 4, 5]

2

and lossless [6, 7] tapers or bends. This induced us to try to go beyond the results of ref.[2],

aiming at clarifying more deeply the diﬀerence between through-ﬂowing and standing waves

in Marcatili’s tapers and in Gaussian beams. Our new results, reported in this paper, can

be summarized as follows. In Section 2, we show that a numerical analysis (based on an ex-

tended BPM algorithm) of Marcatili’s tapers reconﬁrms that indeed through-ﬂowing waves

are drastically diﬀerent from standing waves. The latter ones match very well the analytical

predictions of the original recipe given in ref.[1], but through-ﬂowing waves have open wave

fronts, so that they do not entail any physical paradox. In Section 3, we provide an analytical

discussion of why, in contrast to classical cases like plane waves in a homogeneous medium

or guided modes in longitudinally invariant waveguides, through-ﬂowing waves in Marcatili’s

tapers are so diﬀerent from standing waves. We show that the diﬀerence is a straightforward

fallout of Maxwell’s equations. Although this entails that through-ﬂowing waves in Mar-

catili’s tapers are never strictly lossless, nonetheless our numerical results reconﬁrm that the

recipes given in ref.[1] do yield extremely low radiation losses. In Section 4 we address the

very similar problem of Gaussian beams in a homogeneous medium. We show that physical

inconsistencies aﬀecting the naive picture of a traveling Gaussian beam disappear, as soon

as Maxwell’s equations are handled with suﬃcient care. In Section 5, we focus our attention

on those waves which were identiﬁed in ref.[2] as the true free-space modes (as opposed to

Gaussian beams). Also for these we show that the picture of a through-ﬂowing wave is

aﬀected in some of its signiﬁcant features, if Maxwell’s equtions are used to go a few steps

further than what had been done in ref.[2].

The common key feature shared by Marcatili’s tapers, Gaussian beams, and free-space

modes, is that in general the Poynting vector is not simply proportional to the square of the

3

modulus of the electric ﬁeld. The actual power distribution in space is more complicated.

In particular, in contrast to classical cases, through-ﬂowing ﬁelds in these problems are

always characterized by nonvanishing reactive powers, which reach their highest levels in the

proximity of the waist of the taper or beam. This indicates that through-ﬂowing waves do

not have all the features of a pure traveling wave, which, by deﬁnition, has a standing-wave

ratio identical to 1, and thus cannot carry any reactive power.

2 Marcatili’s tapers: numerical results.

The geometry of Marcatili’s tapers can possibly be very complicated (e.g., see ref.[8]). Here,

however, we prefer to adopt a simple shape, to avoid that geometrical features may blur the

basic physics we were trying to clarify. The results on which we focus in this Section refer

to a single-mode taper whose graded-index core region is delimited by the two branches of a

hyperbola (labels A and A’ in Figs.(1) and (2)), and has a mirror symmetry with respect to

its waist plane. According to the terminology of ref.[1], this is a “superlinear” taper, with

an index distribution

where η and ϑ are the elliptical coordinates, in the plane of Figs.(1) and (2). Fig.(1)

refers to standing waves, of even (part a) and odd (part b) symmetry with respect to the

waist plane. The closed lines are constant-amplitude contour plots. They are essentially

elliptical, so they agree very well with the predictions of ref.[1].

4

As mentioned brieﬂy in the Introduction, these results were generated using an extended

BPM, which deserves a short description. It is well known that standard BPM codes are

suitable to track only traveling waves, as they do not account for backward waves. Our code

(which uses a Pade’s operator of order (5,5)) generates a traveling wave, but the direction

of propagation is reversed whenever the wave reaches one of the taper ends. In order to

generate a single-mode standing wave, each reﬂection should take place on a surface whose

shape matches exactly that of the wave front. This is very diﬃcult to implement numerically,

especially as long as the wave front shape is the unknownfeature one is looking for. But the

problem can be circumvented, by letting each reﬂection take place on a phase-conjugation

ﬂat mirror. Our code adopts this solution, and calculates then, at each point in the taper,

the sum of the forward and backward ﬁelds. The process stops when the diﬀerence between

two consecutive iterations is below a given threshold.

Fig.(2) refers to a through-ﬂowing wave. The almost vertical dark lines in part a) are the

phase fronts. They are drastically diﬀerent from those predicted by the analytical theory

of ref.[1], which are exempliﬁed in the same ﬁgure as a set of confocal ellipses. Note that

the through-ﬂowing wave has been fabricated numerically in two ways. One was simply to

launch a suitable transverse ﬁeld distribution, and track it down the taper, with a standard

BPM code. The other one was to calculate the linear combination (with coeﬃcients 1 and

j) of the even and odd standing waves shown in Fig.(1). The results obtained in these two

ways are undistinguishable one from the other. This, altogether, proves that indeed through-

ﬂowing waves are drastically diﬀerent from standing ones. In particular, as we said in the

Introduction, through-ﬂowing waves are totally free from any untenable feature under the

viewpoint of energy conservation.

5

Fig.(2.b) shows a ﬁeld amplitude contour plot for the same through-ﬂowing wave as in

Fig.(2.a). It indicates that, in spite of all the matters of principle which make a through-

ﬂowing wave diﬀerent from a standing one, its propagation through the taper is indeed almost

adiabatic. Therefore, as anticipated in the Introduction, insertion losses of Marcatili’s tapers

are very low, at least as long as the length to width ratio is not too small, although not strictly

zero. A typical example is shown in Fig.(3). It refers to a taper like that of Figs.(1) and (2),

whose total length is 2.5µm, whose waist width is 0.55µm, and whose initial (and ﬁnal) width

is 1.65µm. The BPM calculations yield a lost power fraction of 1.4

10−4 at a wavelength

×

of 1.55µm.

3 Marcatili’s tapers: analytical remarks.

For the sake of clarity, let us restrict ourselves to the case of two-dimensional tapers, like

those of the previous section, where the geometry and the index distribution are independent

of the z coordinate, orthogonal to the plane of the ﬁgures. However, our remarks will apply

to 3-D structures also.

The index distributions that were identiﬁed in ref.[1] are such that the TE modes (electric

ﬁeld parallel to z) satisfy rigorously a wave equation which can be solved by separation of

variables. Obviously, the same equation is satisﬁed rigorously by the transverse component of

the magnetic ﬁeld, as well. However, in general, if we take two identical solutions of these two

wave equations (except for a proportionality constant), it is easy to verify that they do not

satisfy Maxwell’s equations. This statement could be tested, for example, on the superlinear

taper of the previous Section. However, this proof would be mathematically cumbersome,

6

requiring use of Mathieu functions of the fourth kind, which satisfy the wave equation in

the elliptic coordinate system. A much simpler, yet enlightening example, is the device

which was referred to in ref.[1] as “linear taper” : a wedged-shape region, with a suitable

index distribution, where only one guided mode can propagate in the radial direction. It is

perfectly legitimate to say that the dependence of Ez on the radial coordinate is expressed

by a Hankel function, whose imaginary order, iν, is related to the features of the individual

taper [1]. What one cannot extrapolate from this, is that the same holds for the magnetic

ﬁeld.

In fact, let us calculate the curl of the electric ﬁeld. We ﬁnd that the azimuthal

component of the magnetic ﬁeld is proportional to the ﬁrst derivative of the Hankel function

with respect to its argument (proportional to the radial coordinate). This derivative is

never proportional to the function itself. This is a drastic diﬀerence with respect to plane

waves, or to guided modes of longitudinally invariant waveguides, where the derivative of

an exponential function (expressing the dependency on the longitudinal coordinate) remains

proportional to the function itself. We see that in Marcatili’s tapers, although Ez and Hϑ,

on any wavefront, have identical dependencies on the transverse coordinates, nevertheless it

is troublesome to deﬁne a wave impedance, because they do not vary in identical fashions

along the coordinate of propagation. It is equally risky to derive claims [1] regarding the

Poynting vector from just the spatial distribution of the electric ﬁeld, skipping the details of

the magnetic ﬁeld.

Let us strengthen our point with a few calculations, which aim at proving explicitly

that a TE wave, whose radial dependence is expressed by a Hankel function of imaginary

order, Hiν, cannot be a pure traveling wave along a linear taper. As we just said, if Ez is

proportional to Hiν, then Maxwell’s equations say that Hϑ is proportional to iH ′

iν. The

7

radial component of the Poynting vector is proportional to iHiν(H ′

iν)∗. In a purely traveling

wave, by deﬁnition there is no reactive power ﬂowing in the direction of propagation. In the

case at hand, this would imply

Hiν
|

2 = constant along the radial direction, a requirement
|

which cannot be satisﬁed by Hankel functions. Incidentally, note that exponential functions,

which describe traveling plane waves and modes of longitudinally invariant waveguides, do

satisfy this type of requirement. Coming back to the linear taper, it is easy to show that the

requirement which chararcterizes a purely standing wave - zero active power in the radial

direction - is satisﬁed by Bessel functions of order iν. This reconﬁrms that the exact modes of

the lossless tapers found in ref.[1] are only standing waves. Any through-ﬂowing wave along

such a taper must be expressed as a linear combination of such standing waves. This point

had already been stated in ref.[2]; the new contribution of this paper consists in showing

that the impossibility of expressing a traveling wave in terms of one simple function of the

coordinate along which it propagates (say, the Hankel function in the previous example) is a

consequence not of singularities, but of the inherent nature of partially standing wave which

characterizes such functions.

4 Analysis of Gaussian beams.

One of the points raised in ref.[2] was that the usual picture of a Gaussian beam may run into

the same physical incosistency as a single traveling wave in a Marcatili taper. In fact, if we

read the mathematics of Gaussian beams in a literal way, we ﬁnd that the phase fronts are

ellipsoidal surfaces, which are closed surfaces. A traveling wave with a closed phase front is

either exploding from a localized source, or imploding onto a localized absorber. In a lossless

8

homogeneous medium, without sources, this is untenable. For a loosely focused beam, whose

phase fronts are almost ﬂat, the ﬁeld amplitude is negligibly small in the regions - far from

the beam axis - where the two “halves” of a phase front (one half on each side of the beam

waist) meet. Consequently, the point that the phase fronts are closed surfaces appears not

to be, in such a case, of practical relevance. On the contrary, in a tightly focused beam

this fact is not irrelevant, and could explain some discrepancies between experiments and

the simplest theories, which have been observed and reported in the literature. Once again,

as noted in ref.[2], a standing wave with closed constant-amplitude surfaces is physically

meaningful, regardless of how tightly it is focused. Henceforth, a traveling Gaussian beam

which passes through its waist plane can be modeled correctly as the sum of two standing

waves, of opposite parity with respect to the beam waist plane.

In this Section, we will show that the diﬀerence between traveling and standing waves -

a deep diﬀerence as a matter of principle - can be explained as in the previous Section, using

Maxwell’s equations. Furthermore, this procedure will enable us to ﬁnd quantitative criteria

to assess when these changes with respect to the naive theory (where the Poynting vector

is simply taken to be proportional to the square of the electric ﬁeld) become of practical

relevance. We will also show that the signs of the terms which are usually neglected in

the power distribution depend on the beam polarization. To underline this, we speak of

transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) Gaussian beams, in contrast to the

classical T EMm,n terminology. We will deal explicitly only with the TE case. The reader

may easily derive the TM case by duality.

It is elementary, starting from Maxwell’s equations, to show that in the paraxial approx-

imation all the components of the electric ﬁeld vector, and all those of the magnetic ﬁeld

vector, satisfy (2). What is usually taken for granted is that, for a beam whose transverse

electric ﬁeld, say Ex, is expressed by (3), the transverse magnetic ﬁeld Hy is also of the form

(3), so that the wave impedance Ex/Hy is constant in space.In reality, this is not true: if we

For Hy to be proportional to Ex and the wave impedance to be equal to η =

µ/ǫ, this

expression should reduce to its ﬁrst term. The second term, small and independent of the

p

transverse coordinates, is insigniﬁcant. The following terms are small compared to k, but

not negligible, not even in the paraxial approximation, as the reader can check by calculating

the second derivative with respect to z and comparing it to (6) multiplied by k.

What can make these terms important (at least as a matter of principle) is that they

depend on the transverse coordinates. The third term in (6) aﬀects the real part of the

Poynting vector, so that the active power density ﬂowing through any cross section of the

beam is not simply

Ex
|

2/(2η). The last term gives rise to an imaginary component of the
|

Poynting vector, indicating that there is reactive power present in the beam - a feature in

contrast with the naive model of the beam as a pure traveling wave. Let us look at both

terms in more detail.

The third term is the sum of two quantities of opposite sign, with identical dependence

on the transverse coordinates through r2 = x2 + y2, but diﬀerent dependences on z through

1/R and 1/w2. Their sum cancels out exactly for z =

πw2

0/λ = zR, i.e. at the two extremes

±

of the so-called Rayleigh range (w0 being the spot size at the beam waist). On those two

planes, but only there, the wave impedance is independent of r, and equal to η. Within the

Rayleigh range, the positive contribution dominates, and the wave impedance (equal to η

only for r = 0) decreases as the distance from the z-axis grows. For example, on the waist

plane, where 1/R = 0, at r = 0.3zR (where the ﬁeld is still appreciable, in a very tightly

11

focused beam) the wave impedance is about 5% smaller than η. On the contrary, out of the

Rayleigh range the sum in question becomes negative. Its magnitude reaches a maximum

at a distance z =

√3zR, and then decays to zero as z tends to inﬁnity. The corresponding

±

corrections on the wave impedance are negligible where the ﬁeld amplitude is signiﬁcant.

Therefore, we may conclude that the usual TEM model is perfectly adequate out of the

Rayleigh range.

The last term in (6), giving rise to reactive power, also consists of two contributions of

opposite sign, whose sum cancels out along the hyperboloid r2 = w2/2 and has odd parity

with respect to the waist plane, z = 0. Poynting’s theorem, in a lossless medium and with

no sources, leads then to the conclusion that electric and magnetic energy densities are not

equally stored, at all points, in a Gaussian beam.

In the TE case, there is more electric

than magnetic energy stored near the beam axis, and this becomes more evident as one gets

closer to the waist. The reverse is true in the periphery. Note that, with a simple change of

variable u = 2r2/w2, and integrating by parts, it is easy to verify that for any z

(7)

The net ﬂux of reactive power through any plane orthogonal to the beam axis is zero.

Therefore, any “space slice” between such planes is resonant, i.e.

stores equal amounts

of magnetic and electric energy. But locally, this is not the case. Also note that these

ﬁndings match the previously outlined points on active power. Indeed, if on the waist plane

the wave impedance is smaller in the periphery compared to the center, then the ratio of

magnetic to electric energy has to be larger in the periphery - and in fact it is. Finally,

12

the interested reader can calculate, through Maxwell’s equations, the Hz component of the

magnetic ﬁeld, and then the corresponding imaginary y-component of the Poynting vector.

Its sign reconﬁrms the previous statement: electric energy stored around the axis is more

than the magnetic one, the opposite is true in the periphery.

5 Analysis of free-space modes.

One of the key issues of ref.[2] was to show that a through-ﬂowing beam in free space can be

correctly modeled, without running into inconsistencies or paradoxes, as the superposition

of two standing waves of opposite parities. The typical example discussed in detail in ref.[2]

was a wave whose electric ﬁeld, parallel to the z-axis, is expressed, in cylindrical cordinates

r, ϑ, z (see Fig. 4), as

Ez(r, ϑ) = J0(kr) + jJ1(kr) sin(ϑ)

(8)

where J0, J1 are Bessel functions of the ﬁrst kind of orders 0, 1, respectively, and k = 2π/λ is

the free-space wave number. In ref.[2], no explicit statements were made on how the power

of this wave is distributed in space. However, it is legitimate to infer from the silence on this

point, that it was taken for granted in ref.[2] what had been stated in ref.[1], namely that

the Poynting vector was everywhere proportional to the square of the modulus of the electric

ﬁeld, since free space is a homogeneous medium. In the previous Sections, we have shown

that this attitude is not justiﬁed when dealing with Marcatili’s tapers or with Gaussian

beams. In this Section we will prove that it is also erroneous in the case of free-space modes.

Let us ﬁrst calculate the Poynting vector as

µ0/ǫ0 is the free-space

Pr =

(9)

This expression does not match with the idea of a through-ﬂowing beam. As a matter of

fact, the ﬂow lines for Pr, depicted in Fig. (5.a), clearly give the feeling of an exploding

wave, rather than of a through-ﬂowing beam.

Let us now see what we ﬁnd when we proceed rigorously, in the same way as in the

previous Sections. We calculate the magnetic ﬁeld (two components) as the curl of eq.(8)

in cylindrical coordinates, then the Poynting vector (radial and azimuthal component). We

take its real part, and express it in terms of its cartesian components, in the reference frame

shown in Fig.(4). These calculations yield:

These results describe correctly a ﬂow of active power, essentially in the direction of the

y-axis. For example, to stress the fundamental diﬀerence with respect to (9), the fact that

the sign of

(Py) remains negative for ϑ = π/4, 3π/4, 5π/4, 7π/4 is perfectly adequate to

ℜ

describe a ﬂow from the y > 0 half space towards the y < 0 half space.

densities is far from being identically null. This conﬁrms that the ﬁeld (8) is a partially

standing wave. Once again, exactly like in the other cases discussed in the previous Sections,

the crucial diﬀerence between a standing wave and a through-ﬂowing beam is that the

equal-amplitude loci of the ﬁrst one must not be confused with the surfaces orthogonal to

the Poynting vector of the second one.

6 Conclusion.

We tried to shed new light on an old problem, namely, whether the idea of a guided mode

traveling without any loss through a dielectric taper can be sustained without running into

any physical paradox. Our numerical results, obtained with an extended BPM technique,

have fully reconﬁrmed what was stated in ref.[2]: in Marcatili’s tapers, standing waves have

the basic features outlined in ref.[1], but through-ﬂowing waves do not. This prevents travel-

ing waves from running into a paradox, but on the other hand entails some loss radiation. We

have provided an explanation for the unexpected and puzzling result, the drastic diﬀerence

between standing and through-ﬂowing waves in the same structures. The source of these

“surprise” is built into Maxwell’s equations.

It was pointed out in ref.[2] that some of the problems discussed here with reference to

Marcatili’s tapers apply to Gaussian beams in free space as well. Indeed, in the rest of this

paper we have discussed Gaussian beams and free-space modes expressed in terms of Bessel

functions, and reached essentially the same conclusions as for Marcatili’s tapers.

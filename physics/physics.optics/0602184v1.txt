We present an analytical model of the resonantly enhanced transmission of light through a sub-
wavelength nm-size slit in a thick metal ﬁlm. The simple formulae for the transmitted electromag-
netic ﬁelds and the transmission coeﬃcient are derived by using the thin-slit approximation and
the Green function formalism for the solution of Maxwell’s equations. The resonance wavelengths
are in agreement with the semi-analytical model [Y. Takakura, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 5601 (2001)],
which solves the wave equations by using the Rayleigh ﬁeld expansion. Our formulae, however, show
great resonant enhancement of a transmitted wave, while the Rayleigh expansion model predicts
attenuation. The diﬀerence is attributed to the near-ﬁeld subwavelength diﬀraction, which is not
considered by the models based on the Rayleigh expansion.

INTRODUCTION

The near-ﬁeld localization and resonantly enhanced transmission of light by metal subwavelength nanostructures,
such as a single aperture, a grating of apertures or an aperture surrounded by grooves, attract increasing interest
of researchers. The recent studies1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 have pointed out that the localization and enhanced (anomalous)
transmission of light by a grating of holes or slits can be better understood by elucidating the optical properties of
a single subwavelength slit. Along this direction, it was already demonstrated that a TM-polarized light wave can
be localized in the near-ﬁeld subwavelength zone of a metal slit and simultaneously enhanced by a factor of about
10-1032,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. The general analysis and interpretation of these results, however, are very complicated
because the studies are based mainly on purely numerical computer models. Recently, a simple semi-analytical
model of the light transmission by a subwavelength metal slit was developed1. The study clearly showed that the
transmission coeﬃcient versus wavelength possesses a Fabry-Perot-like resonant behavior. Unfortunately, the model1
predicts transmission peaks with very low magnitude (attenuation), while the experiments and computer models
2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 demonstrate the great resonant enhancement of a transmitted wave.

In this paper, we present an analytical model of the resonantly enhanced transmission of light through a sub-
wavelength nm-size metal slit. The simple formulae for the transmitted electromagnetic ﬁelds and the transmission
coeﬃcient are derived by using the thin-slit approximation and the Green function formalism for the solution of
Maxwell’s equations. The article is organized as follows. The model and formulae are described in section II. In
section III, the model is compared with the results of the semi-analytical model1. We show that the resonance wave-
lengths determined by our formulae are in agreement with the model1, which solves the wave equations by using the
Rayleigh ﬁeld expansion. The formulae, however, indicate great resonant enhancement of a transmitted wave, while
the Rayleigh expansion model1 predicts attenuation. The summary and conclusion are given in section IV.

II. ANALYTICAL MODEL BASED ON GREEN’S FUNCTION FORMALISM

a. Theoretical background Let us consider the scattering of TM-polarized light by a subwavelength slit in a thick
metallic ﬁlm of perfect conductivity. From the latter metal property it follows that surface plasmons do not exist in
the ﬁlm. Such a metal is described by the classic Drude model for which the plasmon frequency tends towards inﬁnity.
We follow the Neerhoﬀ and Mur theoretical development based on the Green function formalism for the solution of
Maxwell’s equations11,12,13.

FIG. 1: Schematic diagram of light scattering by a subwavelength slit (waveguide) in a thick metallic ﬁlm.

The schematic diagram of the light scattering is shown in Fig. 1. The transmission of a plane wave through a
subwavelength (λ < 2a) slit of width 2a in a metal ﬁlm of thickness b is considered. In region I, the incident wave
propagates in the (x − z) plane at an angle Θ with respect to the z axis. The magnetic ﬁeld of the wave is assumed
to be time harmonic with the frequency ω = kc and both polarized and constant in the y direction:

~H(x, y, z, t) = U (x, z)exp(−iωt)~ey.

The electric ﬁeld of the wave is found from the scalar ﬁeld U (x, z) using Maxwell’s equations. Thus, the electromagnetic
ﬁeld is determined by a single scalar ﬁeld U (x, z). In the regions I, II and III, the ﬁeld is represented by U1(x, z),
U2(x, z) and U3(x, z), respectively. The ﬁeld satisﬁes the Helmholtz equation (∇2 + k2
j )Uj = 0, where j = 1, 2, 3.
In region I, the ﬁeld U1(x, z) is decomposed into three components, U1(x, z) = U i(x, z) + U r(x, z) + U d(x, z), each
of which satisﬁes the Helmholtz equation. The incident ﬁeld U i(x, z) = exp[ik1(x sin Θ − z cos Θ)] is assumed to be
a plane wave of unit amplitude. U r(x, z) = U i(x, 2b − z) denotes the ﬁeld that would be reﬂected if there were no
slit in the ﬁlm. U d describes the ﬁeld diﬀracted by the slit into region I. To ﬁnd the ﬁeld, the 2-dimensional Green’s
theorem is applied with one function given by U (x, z) and the other by a conventional Green’s function:

where (x, z) refers to a ﬁeld point of interest; x′ and z′ are integration variables, j = 1, 2, 3. Since Uj satisﬁes the
Helmholtz equation, Green’s theorem reduces to

The unknown ﬁelds U d(x, z), U3(x, z) and U2(x, z) respectively for the regions (b < z < ∞), (−∞ < z < 0) and
(|x| < a, 0 < z < b) are found using the reduced Green’s theorem and the standard boundary conditions for a perfectly
conducting ﬁlm

b. The analytical model and formulae Let us now present an approximate analytical solution of the scattering
problem. For a subwavelength slit, the thin-slit condition 2a << λ is a very good approximation. In such a case, it
can be easily demonstrated that an accurate solution exists for the above matrix equation in the case of N = 1, which
is valid at |z| > 2a/N (see, ref.13). We have derived the simple formulae for the transmitted electromagnetic ﬁeld
and the transmission coeﬃcient using the thin-slit approximation. After simple calculation using the above equations
with N = 1, the analytical formulae for the magnetic ~H(x, z) and electric ~E(x, z) ﬁelds in region III can be presented

FIG. 2: The near-ﬁeld distributions |Hy|, |Ex| and |Ez| of the transmitted wave with λ = 2500 nm calculated at z = -150 nm
for the slit width 2a = 150 nm and the screen thickness b = 150 nm.

III. COMPARISON WITH MODEL BASED ON RAYLEIGH’S FIELD EXPANSION

The analytical formulae (21-27) for the transmitted electromagnetic ﬁeld and the transmission coeﬃcient have
been derived by using the thin-slit (2a << λ) approximation and the Green function formalism for the solution of
Maxwell’s equations. The main objective of our analysis is to test the accuracy and range of validity of the formulae.
We have calculated the magnetic ~H(x, z) and electric ~E(x, z) ﬁelds of the transmitted wave for diﬀerent parameters
of the slit. As an example, Fig. 2 shows the near-ﬁeld (z = 150nm) distributions |Hy(x, z)|, |Ex(x, z)| and |Ez(x, z)|
calculated by the analytical formulae (21-24) for the the slit width 2a = 150 nm and the screen thickness b = 150
nm. The distributions are in agreement with the rigorous numerical computer model13. The ﬁeld components Hy and
Ex are collimated to approximately the aperture width 2a (see, Fig. 2). Thus, the energy ﬂux Sz of a wave passing
through a subwavelength slit can be used to provide a subwavelength image with the optical resolution of about 2a.
We calculated the magnetic ~H(x, z) and electric ~E(x, z) ﬁelds of the transmitted wave also in the region (|z| > 2a/N ,
N = 1). The calculations showed that the accuracy of the formulae (21-24) decreases with decreasing the value |z|.

The transmission of light by the slit is a process that depends on the wavelength. Due to the dispersion, the
amplitude of a wave does change under propagation through the slit. This leads to attenuation or ampliﬁcation of the
wave intensity. In our analytical model, the transmission coeﬃcient T (λ, a, b) is described by the analytical formula
(27). We now check the consistency of the results by comparing the transmission coeﬃcient T (λ) calculated by using
the semi-analytical model1 with those obtained by our formula (27).

Analysis of Eq. 27 indicates the slit-wave interaction behavior, which is similar to those of a Fabry-Perot resonator.
The minimum thickness of the screen is required to get the waveguide resonance inside the slit at a given wavelength.
Figure 3 shows the transmission coeﬃcient (curve A) as a function of the wavelength λ calculated by using the
formula (27) for the slit width 2a = 150 nm and the screen thickness (b = 150 nm) smaller than the wavelength
λ. The transmission coeﬃcient (curve B) calculated in the study1 is presented in the ﬁgure for comparison.
In
contrast to the study1, the transmission (curve A) calculated by our formula exhibits resonance peak, while curve
B demonstrates no resonances. In Fig. 3, the screen thickness b has been chosen in such a way as to include one
Fabry-Perot resonant wavelength λF P = 2b. We notice that the resonance peak is red shifted in comparison with the
respective Fabry-Perot wavelength λF P = 300 nm. In Fig. 4, the slit includes several Fabry-Perot resonances at the
wavelengths λF P = 2b/n. Figure 4 shows the transmission (curve A) as a function of the wavelength λ calculated
by using the formula (27) for the slit width 2a = 150 nm and the screen thickness (b = 1000 nm) greater than the
wavelength. The transmission spectra calculated for the same slit in the study1 is presented in the ﬁgure for the
comparison. The transmission (curves A and B) shown in Fig. 4, indicates the slit-wave interaction behavior, which
is similar to those of a Fabry-Perot resonator. The transmission resonance peaks, however, have a systematic shift
from the Fabry-Perot wavelength λF P = 2b/n (n=1,2,3...) towards longer wavelengths. We notice that the resonance
wavelengths determined by our formulae are in agreement with the model1, which solves the wave equations by using
the Rayleigh ﬁeld expansion. The peak heights (curve A), however, are diﬀerent from the results1. Our formula

The dotted vertical lines correspond the resonant wavelengths given by the analytical formula. The respective Fabry-Perot
resonances are indicated by vertical solid lines

(27), predicts the great resonant enhancement of a transmitted wave, while the Rayleigh expansion model1 indicates
attenuation. This indicates the limitations of the model1.

Analysis of the denominator of the formulae (25-27) shows that the transmission will exhibit the maximums around
the Fabry-Perot wavelengths λF P = 2b/n (n=1,2,3...). The shifts of the resonance wavelengths from the values λF P
= 2b/n are caused by the wavelength dependent term in the denominator of Eq. 27 (see, Eqs. 25, 26). The values of
the resonant wavelengths and the shifts calculated using the analytical formula (27) are in good agreement with the
values calculated using the analytical formula of the study 1. The formula (27), however, shows the great resonant
enhancement of a transmitted wave, while the Rayleigh expansion model1 predicts attenuation. The diﬀerence is
attributed to the inﬂuence of the near-ﬁeld subwavelength diﬀraction, which is not considered by the models based
on the Rayleigh ﬁeld expansion. Indeed, the Rayleigh-like expansion models use the two component decomposition
U1(z)∼U i(z)+U r(z) in one dimension, which does not take into account the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction. The Green-function
model, however, uses the ﬁeld U1(x, z) = U i(x, z) + U r(x, z) + U d(x, z), which includes the near-ﬁeld diﬀraction ﬁeld
U d(x, z) in two dimensions.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

7

We have presented an analytical model of the resonantly enhanced transmission of light through a subwavelength
nm-size slit in a thick metal ﬁlm. The simple formulae for the transmitted electromagnetic ﬁelds and the transmission
coeﬃcient were derived by using the thin-slit approximation and the Green function formalism for the solution of
Maxwell’s equations. The resonance wavelengths are in agreement with the semi-analytical model1, which solves the
wave equations by using the Rayleigh ﬁeld expansion. Our formulae, however, show great resonant enhancement
of a transmitted wave, while the Rayleigh expansion model predicts attenuation. The transparent explanation of
the diﬀerence between the results of the two models was presented. The diﬀerence is attributed to the near-ﬁeld
subwavelength diﬀraction, which is not considered by the models based on the Rayleigh ﬁeld expansion. We believe
that the presented analytical model gains insight into the physics of resonant transmission and localization of light
by subwavelength nanoapertures in metal ﬁlms.

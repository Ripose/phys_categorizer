The waveguiding properties of two silica-based airguiding photonic bandgap

ﬁber designs are investigated with special emphasis on material eﬀects. The

nonlinear coeﬃcients are found to be 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than

those obtained in index-guiding microstructured ﬁbers with large mode areas.

The material dispersion of silica makes a signiﬁcant contribution to the total

chromatic dispersion although less than 10% of the ﬁeld energy is located

in the silica regions of the ﬁbers. These ﬁndings suggest that dispersion

engineering through the choice of base material may be a possibility in this

type of ﬁbers.

Introduction

Photonic bandgap (PBG) ﬁbers guiding light in a hollow core surrounded by a

cladding structure with a bandgap at a refractive index below the light line have at-

tracted considerable attention since their ﬁrst experimental demonstration by Cregan

1

et al.1 Such ﬁbers have been proposed as candidates for highly linear and possibly

low-loss transmission ﬁbers,1 devices for particle transport,2 dispersion compensa-

tion3 and gas nonlinearity experiments.4 In contrast to conventional ﬁbers, the useful

wavelength range is not limited by the absorption loss and nonlinearity of the base

material. The recent fabrication of silica-based airguiding PBG ﬁbers with attenua-

tion coeﬃcients below 30 dB/km over a considerable wavelength range5 opens up for

a wide range of practical applications.

It is usually assumed that the inﬂuence of the base material on elementary ﬁber

properties are negligible for this class of ﬁbers, however the theoretical investigations

performed up to now6, 7 have primarily focused on establishing the shape and trans-

mission windows of the guided modes, and have not, except in the case of circular

Bragg ﬁbers,3 provided a detailed modeling of key quantities such as group velocity

dispersion (GVD), nonlinear coeﬃcients etc. The purpose of the present work is to

model two instances of a simple and well established design of airguiding PBG ﬁbers

with particular emphasis on the interaction between light and base material, which is

here assumed to be silica. Speciﬁcally, we derive the fraction of the ﬁeld energy present

in the silica regions of the ﬁber, the nonlinearity coeﬃcient (expressed as an eﬀective

area) arising from the material nonlinearity of silica, and the GVD including material

dispersion eﬀects. We demonstrate that the fraction of the ﬁeld energy present in the

silica is below 10% for both structures studied, and that the nonlinearity coeﬃcients

arising from silica are 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than what is obtained in the best

silica-based large mode-area ﬁbers. Furthermore, it will be shown that the GVD is

considerably inﬂuenced by the dispersion of the base material, and demonstrate the

2

reason for this interesting eﬀect by a detailed analysis of the material contributions

to the GVD.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we describe the ﬁber

designs to be investigated and brieﬂy outline the theoretical approach adopted here,

including the basic formulae for group velocity and nonlinearity coeﬃcients. In section

3, our numerical results are presented and discussed while section 4 summarizes our

conclusions.

2. Theoretical approach

The two ﬁber structures to be investigated are both based on a cladding structure

consisting of a triangular lattice of airholes, with a core deﬁned by a larger airhole.

The structure is characterized by three parameters: The distance between cladding

hole centers, Λ, which is commonly denoted the pitch, and the diameters of core and

cladding holes. We ﬁx the core hole diameter at 3d, where d is the cladding hole diam-

eter, and investigate two designs with d/Λ=0.88 and d/Λ=0.95 respectively. A design

similar to the former has earlier been modeled by Broeng and co-workers6 whereas

the latter resembles a low-loss airguiding ﬁber recently fabricated by Venkataraman

and co-workers.5 A schematic picture of the core and nearest cladding region in the

design with d/Λ=0.88 is shown in Fig. 1.

In the present work we solve Maxwells equations by expanding the dielectric

function and magnetic ﬁeld vector in plane waves using a freely available software

package.8 Having obtained the magnetic ﬁeld vector the electric ﬁelds are straight-

forwardly calculated by use of Amperes law. The adoption of a planewave basis ne-

3

cessiates the use of periodic boundary conditions, however the interaction between

nearest-neighbor repeated images of the guiding defect can be minimized by a proper

choice of the transverse Bloch wave vector.9 We use a supercell consisting of 8×8 ele-

mentary cells of the triangular lattice comprising the cladding. The Fourier grid used

for the plane-wave expansion has 64×64 meshpoints in each elementary cell for the

structure with d/Λ=0.88, and 96×96 meshpoints for the structure with d/Λ=0.95.

With these parameters, the dispersion coeﬃcients and all other results, are converged

within a few percent.

The nonlinear coeﬃcient of a ﬁber expresses the change in eﬀective index of the

guided mode arising from nonlinear eﬀects for a given input power. The dependency

of the nonlinear coeﬃcient on the form of the guided mode is usually expressed by

an eﬀective area:10

Here P is the power launched into the ﬁber and nP

2 is a material nonlinear co-

eﬃcient (related to the third-order nonlinear susceptibility) in units of W/m2. For

conventional, all-silica, ﬁbers Aeﬀ may be expressed as:10

∆neﬀ = P

nP

We have recently shown that for situations in which a substantial part of the ﬁeld

propagates in air the above deﬁnition must be generalized to:11

Aeﬀ =

n1
n0

 

g !

(

E · DdA)2
SiO2 | E · D |2 dA
R

R

Note that the integration in the denominator is now restricted to the silica parts

of the ﬁber. This formula has been derived without making assumptions about the

ﬁeld energy distribution and is therefore applicable even in the extreme case of air-

guiding PBG ﬁbers. Of course, the Aeﬀ values obtained for these ﬁbers have little

to do with the physical extent of the guided modes, however the expression of the

nonlinear coeﬃcient in this form facilitates the comparison with more conventional

ﬁbers guiding light in silica or other materials.

The GVD coeﬃcient, D, is deﬁned as:

D = −

ω2
2πc

d2β
dω2 =

ω2
2πcv2
g

dvg
dω

where vg is the group velocity:

vg =

dω
dβ

5

(3)

(4)

(5)

In the present case, where the dielectric function is piecewise constant, the group

velocity in the presence of material dispersion eﬀects, may be written:9

where Ed is the fraction of the electric-ﬁeld energy present in the dielectric and

v0
g is the group velocity in the absence of material dispersion. The latter may be

calculated directly from the ﬁelds as:12

vg =

v0
g
2 Ed

,

d ln ε
dω

1 + ω

v0
g = c

Reh[E∗ × H]zi
hH, Hi

(6)

(7)

Thus, the group velocity vg can be evaluated directly from the ﬁelds once the

guided mode has been obtained, and the dispersion coeﬃcient can then be calcu-

lated by a numerical ﬁrst-order derivative. This procedure requires that ω, Ed and

v0
g are evaluated at the silica refractive index appropriate for ω, which in the present

work is achieved by a self-consistency procedure.13 The self-consistent calculations are

compared with calculations assuming a ﬁxed value of the silica refractive index, n,

in order to assess the importance of material dispersion eﬀects. In the selfconsistent

calculations we use the Sellmeier formula for the frequency dependence of the silica

refractive index, with the coeﬃcients reported by Okamoto.14

6

3. Numerical results

In this work we focus on the guidance of the fundamental mode (whose major trans-

verse part is circularly symmetric) in the lowest bandgap. Initially, we will consider

the case of a ﬁxed silica refractive index n=1.45. For this value of n, the ﬁber with

d/Λ=0.88 is found to have a narrow transmission window for the fundamental mode

between λ/Λ=0.724 and λ/Λ=0.685, whereas the ﬁber with d/Λ=0.95 has a some-

what wider transmission window between λ/Λ=0.617 and λ/Λ=0.533. As will become

clear later these transmission windows show some dependence on the material refrac-

tive index, which translates into a dependence on the physical value of the pitch

(since this controls the physical wavelength of the light in the guided mode). In both

ﬁber designs higher-order modes are present in part of the transmission range of the

fundamental mode. For d/Λ=0.88 we ﬁnd that second-order modes are present in the

fundamental bandgap in the lower three-quarters of the transmission window for the

fundamental mode. For d/Λ=0.95 the second-order modes leave the bandgap some-

what earlier, when the fundamental mode is roughly in the middle of the bandgap.

Since the question of determining the single-mode wavelength regions of the ﬁbers is

complicated by the possibility of guidance in the higher-order bandgaps, and is not a

primary concern in this paper, we have not attempted a precise determination of the

transmission windows for the second-order modes.

In Fig. 2(a) the fraction of the electric ﬁeld energy present in the silica part of the

ﬁbers (Ed in Eq. (6)) is plotted as a function of the distance between the frequency

of the fundamental mode and the lower band-gap edge normalized to the gapwidth.

7

Both ﬁber designs show the same qualitative behaviour: Ed rises as the mode enters

or leaves the gap, and therefore a minimum is present inside the transmission window.

However, for the design with d/Λ=0.88 the minimum is present in the low-frequency

part of the transmission window, whereas for d/Λ=0.95 the minimum is shifted close

to the high-frequency transmission edge. It is also noteworthy that the frequency

derivative of Ed is quite large, since the transmission windows are narrow. This has

important consequences for the dispersion properties of the ﬁbers.

In Fig. 2(b) the eﬀective areas, as calculated from Eq. (3), are plotted for the

two ﬁber designs. The results for d/Λ=0.88 have been multiplied by a factor of 10 to

facilitate comparison. As expected, very large Aeﬀ values are found, signifying very low

nonlinear coeﬃcients. In index guiding microstructured ﬁbers in the large-mode area

regime (λ ≪ Λ) the eﬀective area Aeﬀ ∼ α × (d/Λ)−1Λ2 with a numerical prefactor

α of the order 0.5.15 The ﬁbers are typically operated close to the endlessly-single

mode limit (d/Λ ∼ 0.45) so that Aeﬀ ∼ Λ2. Typical values of Λ are 10-20 µm, so

that Aeﬀ ∼100λ2 for λ ∼1µm. Thus, the present results for airguiding PBG ﬁbers

indicate a lowering by 1-2 orders of magnitude of the nonlinear coeﬃcient compared

to typical index-guiding large-mode area microstructured ﬁbers available. Still, it is

interesting to observe the signiﬁcant variation of Aeﬀ over the transmission window,

and the strong dependence on cladding design of the nonlinear coeﬃcients. In the

ﬁber with d/Λ=0.88 a decrease of the eﬀective area with increasing frequency is seen,

corresponding to the increasing fraction of ﬁeld energy in silica (see Eq. (3)). For

d/Λ=0.95 the opposite trend occurs, due to the shift of the minimum in Ed. Of

course, the eﬀective areas reported here relate to the nonlinearity coeﬃcients and

8

have little to do with the physical size of the modes. This is better estimated from

the standard deﬁnition of eﬀective area, Eq. (2), which for both ﬁber designs is found

to be comparable to the area of the hollow core, indicating that the guided mode is

well localized.

In Fig. 3 GVD results for three diﬀerent ﬁber designs are reported. For the

ﬁber with d/Λ=0.88 we have investigated two values of the pitch, Λ=0.8 µm and

Λ=2.4 µm. For the design with d/Λ=0.95 we show results for Λ=1.0 µm. Both the

results of self-consistent calculations and of calculations with a ﬁxed value of the silica

dielectric constant are shown. It can be seen that a change in the silica refractive

index, n, shifts the transmission windows, and thereby the dispersion curves. Due

to the steepness of the dispersion curves this implies that the dispersion at a given

wavelength is strongly dependent on n. Therefore, the waveguide GVD calculated

at n=1.45 (the solid curves), which is the refractive index of silica at a wavelength

of 1.05 µm, gives a poor prediction of the true chromatic dispersion (as given by

the self-consistent calculations, reported by the dotted curves) at other wavelengths.

The agreement is considerably improved by choosing a ﬁxed index suitable for the

wavelength of the guided mode. The results of such calculations are reported by the

dashed curves. However, there is still a noticeable diﬀerence between the dispersion

curves calculated at a ﬁxed n and the self-consistent results. The diﬀerences are of

the same order of magnitude as the material dispersion of homogeneous silica at the

wavelengths in question, and are seen to change sign over the transmission window.

In Fig. 3(a) it is interesting to notice that the dashed and dotted curves do not tend

towards each other at the shortest wavelengths of guidance even though the value of

9

n=1.46 used for calculation of the dashed curve corresponds to a wavelength of ∼550

nm for pure silica. Instead, the curves cross at somewhat longer wavelength. These

ﬁndings indicate that material dispersion eﬀects play a signiﬁcant role despite the

small percentage of ﬁeld energy present in silica.

In order to obtain a more detailed understanding of the inﬂuence of material

dispersion, we return to Equations (4) and (6). The derivative of the group velocity

with respect to frequency may be written:

In this formula, ∂/∂ω (∂/∂β) denotes a derivative with respect to ω (β) for a

ﬁxed value of ε, whereas d/dω (d/dβ) denotes a derivative including the variation of

ε with ω (and thereby β). If dispersion in the base material of the ﬁber is neglected

only the ﬁrst term contributes. Using the equation:9

and approximating dEd/dω ≈ ∂Ed/∂ω, which we have found to be reasonably

Thus the GVD may be separated into a part independent of material dispersion

eﬀects (ﬁrst term in Eq. (10)), a part proportional to Ed and a part proportional to

the frequency derivative of Ed. Using Eq. (4) the GVD is found to be:

(11)

where DSC

w is the GVD in the absence of material dispersion, but evaluated at the

silica refractive index appropriate for the ω value in question. In Fig. 4 the material

dispersion Dmat deﬁned by Eq. (11) is plotted for the two designs guiding at short

wavelengths. For the design with d/Λ=0.88, where 7-9% of the ﬁeld energy is in silica,

the material dispersion ranges between ∼0 and -200 ps/nm/km, whereas for the design

with d/Λ=0.95, and only 2-3% of the ﬁeld energy in silica, the material contribution

to the GVD ranges between -50 and 50 ps/nm/km. Also shown in Fig. 4 is the

11

diﬀerence between the waveguide dispersion at ﬁxed, suitably chosen, n (dashed lines

in Fig. 3) and the self-consistent dispersion coeﬃcients (dotted lines in Fig. 3). Exact

correspondence between solid and dashed curves in Fig. 4 is not to be expected since

the waveguide dispersion, DSC

w in Eq. (11) is evaluated at the self-consistent value of

n, however, it can be seen that the major part of the discrepancy between DW and

DSC in Fig. 3 can be attributed to the intrinsic material dispersion as expressed by

Dmat. Since the material dispersion of homogeneous silica in this wavelength range is

between -250 and -400 ps/nm/km, the Dmat values reported in Fig. 4 are surprisingly

large considering the small values of Ed.

It is evident from Eq. (11) that the contribution of material eﬀects to the total

GVD of a ﬁber is composed of a part proportional to Ed and a part proportional to

∂Ed/∂ω. Herein lies the origin of the surprisingly large Dmat values for the airguiding

ﬁbers: Although Ed is small in these ﬁbers, as is evident from Fig. 2(a), this is not

the case for ∂Ed/∂ω. In Fig. 5 we plot the ratio, RD between the third and second

term in Eq. (11):

(12)

The results for the airguiding ﬁbers in Fig. 5(a) are compared to results for index

guiding microstructured ﬁbers, reported in Fig. 5(b). The latter have a triangular

cladding structure similar to the airguiding ﬁbers, but with a solid silica core deﬁned

by a missing airhole. It can be seen that | RD | for the index guiding ﬁbers is every-

12

where below unity, even in the rather extreme case of d/Λ=0.8, Λ=0.34 µm, where

∼15% of the ﬁeld energy is located in the airholes. For the airguiding PBG ﬁbers

| RD | is 1-2 orders of magnitude larger. Thus, for index-guiding microstructured

ﬁbers the main contribution to material dispersion eﬀects comes from the second

term in Eq. (11), whereas for airguiding PBG ﬁbers the contribution from the third

term dominates.

Because airguiding PBG ﬁbers have the major part of the ﬁeld energy propagating

in air, the choice of base material is less limited by requirements of low loss and/or

nonlinearity than is the case for standard ﬁbers, or index-guiding microstructured

ﬁbers. On the other hand, the results presented in this work show that the dispersion

properties of the material may still have a signiﬁcant impact on the total GVD of the

ﬁber. These observations suggest that dispersion engineering through the choice of

base material may be a possibility in these ﬁbers. A simple example of the possibilities

is shown in Fig. 6: The usual three-term Sellmeier polynomial describing the material

dispersion of silica has been modiﬁed by a fourth term describing the addition of an

(dopant) absorption line close to the transmission window of the ﬁber. The modiﬁed

Sellmeier polynomial reads:

ε(λ) = 1 +

λ3 = 9.896µm

a4 = 0.001µm−2

with λ4 chosen as either 0.5 µm (P500 in Fig. 6) or 0.640 µm (P640 in Fig. 6).

It is evident that signiﬁcant shifts of the dispersion curve can be obtained simply

by addition of (impurity) absorption centers to the silica matrix. A more general

approach would of course be to vary the composition of the base material itself as

could readily be done in, e.g., polymer ﬁbers. Such dispersion engineering could,

for instance, be of interest for ﬁbers applied to the kind of gas-phase nonlinearity

experiments whose feasibility was recently demonstrated by Benabid and co-workers.4

4. Conclusions

In conclusion, we have investigated various aspects of the interplay between base ma-

terial and the fundamental guided mode in silica-based airguiding PBG ﬁbers. For

the two designs studied here, between 2 and 9% of the electric ﬁeld energy was found

to reside in the silica parts of the ﬁber. The nonlinearity coeﬃcient was expressed in

terms of a generalized eﬀective area, which was found to be 1-2 orders of magnitude

larger than what can be obtained in index-guiding microstructured ﬁbers. The inﬂu-

ence of material dispersion on the total GVD of the ﬁbers was investigated and was

14

found to be of the same order of magnitude as in other ﬁber types having most of the

ﬁeld energy residing in silica. This eﬀect was traced to the fact that the variation with

frequency of the ﬁeld energy in silica is much more rapid in airguiding PBG ﬁbers

than in other ﬁber types. These results suggest that dispersion engineering through

the choice of base material may be an interesting possibility in airguiding PBG ﬁbers.

ABSTRACT

We present rigorous simulations of EUV masks with technological imperfections like side-wall angles and corner
roundings. We perform an optimization of two diﬀerent geometrical parameters in order to ﬁt the numerical
results to results obtained from experimental scatterometry measurements. For the numerical simulations we use
an adaptive ﬁnite element approach on irregular meshes.1 This gives us the opportunity to model geometrical
structures accurately. Moreover we comment on the use of domain decomposition techniques for EUV mask
simulations.2 Geometric mask parameters have a great inﬂuence on the diﬀraction pattern. We show that
using accurate simulation tools it is possible to deduce the relevant geometrical parameters of EUV masks from
scatterometry measurements.

This work results from a collaboration between AMTC (mask fabrication), Physikalisch-Technische Bundes-

anstalt (scatterometry) and ZIB/JCMwave (numerical simulation).

1. INTRODUCTION

Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is considered as the main candidate for further miniaturization of com-
puter technology. Since compared to state-of-the art photomasks, EUV masks are illuminated at oblique in-
cidence, the quality of pattern proﬁles becomes important due to shadowing eﬀects.3, 4 Consequently, there
is a need for adequate destruction free pattern proﬁle metrology techniques, allowing characterization of mask
features down to a typical size of 100 nm.

Here we present an indirect method for the determination of geometrical EUV mask parameters.5 Ex-
perimental scatterometry measurements are compared to numerical simulations of EUV masks using the ﬁnite
element method (FEM).

2. CHARACTERIZATION OF EUV MASKS BY EUV SCATTEROMETRY

Single wavelength scatterometry, the analysis of light diﬀracted from a periodic structure, is a well suited tool
for analysis of the geometry of EUV masks. Since scatterometry only needs a light source and a simple detector
with no imaging lens system, its setup is inexpensive and oﬀers no additional technical challenges. Fig. 1(a)
shows a sketch of the experimental setup. Light of ﬁxed wavelength and ﬁxed incident angle is reﬂected from
the mask and the intensity of the reﬂected light is measured in dependence on the diﬀraction angle. The use
of EUV light for mask characterization is advantageous because it ﬁts the small feature sizes on EUV masks.
Diﬀraction phenomena are minimized, and of course the appropriate wavelength of the resonant structure of the
underlying multilayer is chosen. Light is not only reﬂected at the top interface of the mask but all layers in the
stack contribute to reﬂection. Therefore one expects that EUV radiation provides much more information on
relevant EUV mask features than conventional long wavelength methods.

All measurements for the present work were performed by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB)
at the electron storage ring BESSY II.6 PTB’s EUV reﬂectometer installed in the soft X-ray radiometry beamline
allows high-accuracy measurements of very large samples with diameters up to 550 mm.7–9

Fig. 1(b) shows the result of a scatterometry measurement of an EUV test mask (see table 1) considered in the

pattern. However the intensities of the diﬀraction orders do not carry direct information about other topological
features of the mask. The determination of these features from a scatterometry measurement is a challenging

inverse problem and a hot topic of actual research. Accurate and fast numerical simulation of the scattering
experiment thereby plays a vital role. The FEM method is particularly suited for this application. It has several

advantages10:

• Maxwell’s equations describing the scattering problem are solved rigorously without approximations.

• The ﬂexibility of triangulations allows modeling of virtually arbitrary structures, as illustrated in Fig. 2.

• Adaptive mesh-reﬁnement strategies lead to very accurate results and small computational times which

are crucial points for application of a numerical method to the characterization of EUV masks.

• Choosing appropriate localized ansatz functions for the solution of Maxwell’s equations physical properties
of the electric ﬁeld like discontinuities or singularities can be modeled very accurately and don’t give rise
to numerical problems, see Fig.3.

• It is mathematically proven that the FEM approach converges with a ﬁxed convergence rate towards the
exact solution of Maxwell-type problems for decreasing mesh width of the triangulation. Therefore it is
easy to check if numerical results can be trusted.

Figure 3. FEM solution for the electric ﬁeld propagating through a phase mask. The electric ﬁeld has singular behaviour
at corners of the absorber and discontinuities at material interfaces.

Throughout this paper we use the FEM solver JCMharmony for numerical solution of Maxwell’s equations.
JCMharmony has been successfully applied to a wide range of electromagnetic ﬁeld computations including
waveguide structures,11 DUV phase masks,10 and other nano-structured materials.12, 13
It provides higher

order edge elements, multigrid methods, a-posteriori error control, adaptive mesh reﬁnement, etc. Furthermore a
special domain decomposition algorithm implemented in JCMharmony is utilized for simulation of EUV masks.2
Light propagation in the multilayer stack beneath the absorber pattern can be determined analytically. The
domain decomposition algorithm combines the analytical solution of the multilayer stack with the FEM solution
of the absorber pattern, dramatically decreasing computational time and increasing accuracy of simulation
results.

The idea of characterising EUV masks with scatterometry measurements and FEM simulations is the com-
exp
of experimental diﬀraction orders n with numerically obtained results.5 First
parison of the intensities I
n
the geometry of the EUV mask is modeled using a ﬁnite number of parameters. Then scattering from the EUV
mask is simulated and the intensities Isim
of the diﬀraction orders are computed. The deviation ξ between ex-
perimental and numerical intensities is computed and the parameters which minimize this deviation determined.
This leads to a ﬁnite dimensional optimization problem. In the experimental setup light of each diﬀraction order
is always reﬂected into a ﬁnite solid angle leading to peaks with ﬁnite width, see Fig. 1(b). The experimental
exp
intensities I
that are used are given as the heights of these peaks which are only proportional to the whole
n
intensity diﬀracted into an order (i.e. the integral over a peak). Numerically we determine the whole intensity
of each diﬀraction order and therefore we have to scale the simulated intensities Isim
uniformly with a factor γ
before determining the deviation ξ:

The described procedure was applied to an EUV test mask produced by AMTC. The unknown mask param-
eters of interest were the sidewall angle of the absorber stack (which was restricted to α ≤ 90◦) and the top
critical dimension (deﬁned in Fig. 4).

The search for the optimal parameter set of the layout was performed using the Nelder-Mead simplex al-
gorithm. As starting point the AMTC design parameters were chosen. In order to evaluate the results of our
procedure scatterometry measurements and FEM simulations were compared at three diﬀerent EUV wavelengths,
shown in Fig. 5.

A comparison of diﬀraction orders obtained from scatterometry and FEM simulation is shown in Fig. 7 for
the optimal EUV mask parameters found during optimization. We see excellent agreement at all wavelengths of
incident EUV radiation. Only the tenth diﬀraction order at λ3 = 13.9 nm diﬀers. Here the simulated intensity
is much lower than the experimental and therefore the deviation ξ2 much larger than for λ1 = 13.4 nm and
λ2 = 13.65 nm, see table 2. The geometrical parameters which belong to the best ﬁtting simulations are shown
in table 2 in comparison to the desired design values for the mask. We see that the best ﬁtting geometries agree

and the top CD is 0.8 nm (0.5%) smaller than for λ2 and λ3.

Fig. 6(a), (b) shows how the deviation ξ2 between experimental and simulated diﬀraction orders depends on
the top critical dimension and the absorber angle α. It grows strongly with increasing distance from the optimal
geometrical parameters. This shows that the presented method is very robust.

ﬁtting value for R was determined at the incident wavelength λ2 = 13.65 nm and the optimal values for top
CD = 146.5 nm and α = 90.0◦. Fig. 6(c) shows a minimal deviation between experiment and simulation for
R = 6.2 nm. We see that the edge radius does not have such a great eﬀect on the diﬀraction orders since the
deviation ξ2 hardly changes compared to the eﬀects of the top CD (a) and absorber angle (b). This conﬁrms
further that for the determination of more sophisticated geometrical parameters very accurate simulations are
crucial. As already mentioned the convergence of the FEM method is mathematically proven and it is therefore a
very good choice for the presented method. Fig. 8 shows the convergence of the zeroth and ﬁrst diﬀraction order.
We see the relative error in dependence on the number of unknowns of the FEM computation (i.e. a coarser
triangulation). Furthermore the computational time on a standard PC (3.4 GHz Intel Pentium 4, 1GB RAM) is
shown at each reﬁnement step of the grid. After 72 s we already have a relative error of 10−3 much smaller than
the experimental uncertainty of about 0.01. A short computation time also becomes crucial for the determination
of mask parameters when choosing a larger number of independent geometrical parameters and performing the
search for the optimal values in a higher dimensional space. We expect that scatterometry measurements at
several diﬀerent wavelengths will become very important for the presented method when characterizing EUV
masks in greater detail. In order to further validate the geometrical parameters of the EUV mask obtained via
scatterometry and FEM simulation a comparison to direct measurements like atomic force microscopy is planned.
These measurements will be carried out at AMTC.

5. CONCLUSIONS

We demonstrated that single wavelength scatterometry in combination with FEM simulations is a promising
candidate for an accurate and robust destruction free characterization of EUV masks. Thereby experimental
diﬀraction orders are compared to FEM simulations of EUV masks. For FEM simulations the EUV mask is ﬁrst
described with a ﬁnite number of geometrical parameters like sidewall angles, line widths, corner roundings, etc.
and then the best ﬁtting values determined by minimizing the deviation of experimental and numerical data.

Here we considered the top critical dimension, the sidewall angle and the edge radius of the absorber stack
of an EUV mask as unknown geometrical parameters. The search for the best ﬁtting geometry at three diﬀerent
wavelengths gave nearly the same values for the top critical dimension and the absorber sidewall angle proving
both robustness and accuracy of the method. Furthermore the absorber edge radius had only minor inﬂuence
on the numerical diﬀraction pattern.

We showed that very accurate numerical simulations are crucial for detailed geometric characterization of
EUV masks using scatterometry data. The FEM method is well suited for the simulation of EUV masks since it
allows computation of nearly arbitrary geometries, is very accurate and very fast. Thereby very fast simulation
of the EUV mask with a ﬁxed parameter set provides a precondition for the solution of the given inverse problem.

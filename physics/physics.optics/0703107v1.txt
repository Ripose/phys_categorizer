Abstract— Dispersion,

impedance matching and resolution
characteristics of an isotropic three-dimensional ﬂat lens (“su-
perlens”) are studied. The lens is based on cubic meshes of
interconnected transmission lines and bulk loads. We study
a practical realization of the lens, based on the microstrip
technology. The dispersion equations that have been previously
derived, are veriﬁed with full-wave simulations. The isotropy of
the structure is veriﬁed with analytical as well as simulation
results. The resolution characteristics of a practically realizable,
lossy lens are studied analytically.

I. INTRODUCTION

Materials with simultaneously negative material parameters
(double-negative or backward-wave materials, where permit-
tivity ε and permeability µ are both effectively negative) [1]
have received a lot of interest in the recent literature. One of
the most exciting applications of these materials is a device
capable of subwavelength resolution (resolution that exceeds
the diffraction limit) [2]. The ﬁrst demonstrations of realized
artiﬁcial backward-wave materials were done in the microwave
region using periodic structures consisting of metal wires
(negative ε) and split-ring resonators (negative µ) [3].

Also the use of loaded transmission-line networks has
been proposed for the realization of wide-band and low-
loss backward-wave materials in the microwave region [4],
[5]. These networks are inherently one-or two-dimensional
structures [6], [7]. Recently, also three-dimensional, isotropic
transmission-line-based backward-wave materials have been
proposed [8], [9], [10] and realized [11].

It has been shown that subwavelength imaging of the near-
ﬁeld is possible even without backward-wave materials (note
that in these cases the focusing of the propagating modes is
not possible). This phenomenon can be achieved with a bulk
material slab having negative permittivity or permeability [12],
or without any bulk material by using planar sheets supporting
surface plasmons [13], [14], [15]. Also devices which operate
in the “canalization” regime have been used successfully
to obtain subwavelength resolution [16], [17]. Some of the
previous methods have also been suggested for use in the
optical region [12], [18], [19].

In this paper, we make a detailed study of a three-
dimensional, isotropic superlens based on loaded transmission-
line networks. This approach to superlens design that we

use here was originally proposed in [10]. Here we conﬁrm
the isotropy of the structure by studying the dependence of
the dispersion on the direction of propagation and verify the
analytical design equations presented in [10] with full-wave
simulations. We also conﬁrm that the impedance matching,
which is essential for operation of the device, is preserved
for all directions of propagation. The resolution enhancement
capability of a practically realizable, lossy lens is analytically
studied using a method presented in [20]. Although the lens
inherently achieves ideal operation at a single frequency only
(the dispersion curves of forward-wave and backward-wave
materials intersect at a single frequency point), we show that
the enhancement of the evanescent modes (which enables
subwavelength resolution) is possible in a small frequency
band near the optimal operation frequency.

II. THE STRUCTURE OF THE LENS

We study the superlens structure presented in [10], [11]. The
superlens is a combination of two types of transmission-line
networks: a region with effectively negative ε and µ is sand-
wiched between two regions possessing effectively positive ε
and µ (forward-wave regions), see Fig. 1. As was previously
shown in [10], the transmission-line networks are easy to
realize using the microstrip technology and we continue to use
this approach in this paper (the design equations can be applied
to other types of transmission lines as well, see [10]). The
forward-wave network has a unit cell as shown in Fig. 2. The
unit cell of the backward-wave network is otherwise similar to

2

Z0,TL is usually different for the forward-wave and backward-
wave networks in order to obtain impedance matching of the
networks [10].

The parameters of the structure that is studied here are the
same as in [11], see Table I (εr is the permittivity of the
substrate of the microstrip lines). Dispersion curves of the
forward-wave and backward-wave networks can be studied
analytically using (1)-(7). The unit cells of the both net-
works have also been simulated with Ansoft HFSS full-wave
simulator to obtain the dispersion curves for both networks.
See Fig. 3 for the dispersion curves when a planewave is
considered (kx = ky = 0). The simulation results agree very
well for all axial directions (practically identical plots). From
Fig. 3 we can conclude that the optimal operation frequency of
the superlens is f = 0.8513 GHz (the frequency at which the
dispersion curves intersect) and at that point the wavenumber
has value kz

47.65 1/m.

In (1)-(6) the indices FW and BW correspond to the dis-
persion equations of forward- and backward-wave networks,
respectively, and qi = kid (wavenumber normalized by the pe-
riod d), where ki is the wavenumber in the network along axis
i. In (7) kTL and Z0,TL are the wavenumber and impedance
of the waves in the transmission lines, respectively. Note that

From (1) and (2) we clearly see that if we consider diagonal
propagation (kx, ky and kz may all be nonzero depending on
the direction of propagation), this introduces some anisotropy
to the dispersion. To study this effect, we have analyzed
propagation in the structure in other than the axial directions.
It has been seen that for the backward-wave network the
.
isotropy is achieved in a large bandwidth below and above
the second stopband (for this example, the isotropic region is
approximately from 0.5 GHz to 2 GHz), and for the forward-
wave network at low frequencies (for this example, below
2 GHz). The operation frequency of the designed lens is well
within this isotropic region for both networks. The optimal
operation frequency obtained here differs slightly from the
one previously presented for a similar structure [11]. The

reason for this is that here we have assumed the effective
permittivity of the transmission lines to be equal to εr (to
simplify comparison between the analytical and simulation
results).

See Figs. 4 and 5 for the results considering different
propagation directions. Note that for the diagonal propagation,
the dispersion curves extend to larger values of ktot =
z than it is shown in Figs. 4 and 5 (these regions
q
are not of interest for superlens operation). The HFSS simu-
lation results agree very well for all of the presented curves.
For clarity only the diagonal propagation corresponding to the
case with kx = ky = kz is presented (squares and circles).

equations derived for the characteristic impedances of the
forward-wave and backward-wave networks [10] to see if the
matching is preserved for all propagation directions. In the
following we study the matching analytically and tune the
impedances of the transmission lines slightly to obtain optimal
resolution performance (in [11] and in the previous section the
impedance values were not ideal due to the fact that the values
were taken from an experimental prototype). It was found that
by changing the impedance of the forward-wave transmission
lines to Z0,TL,FW = 69.46 Ω, the wavenumbers and the
characteristic impedances of the networks can be matched at
the frequency f = 0.8513 GHz. In the rest of this paper, we
use this impedance value and the other design characteristics
stay the same as shown in Table I.

See Fig. 6 for the characteristic impedances of the both
networks for different propagation directions. Note that be-
cause we are interested in the matching between the two
networks, the characteristic impedance is deﬁned as the ratio
of the voltage and the z-component of the current (as was
done in [10], [11]). We see that although the values of the
impedances change as the direction of propagation changes
(naturally, because the impedance depends on kz), the match-
ing is preserved for different propagation directions at the
operation frequency (f = 0.8513 GHz).

ky = 0; dashed line: ky = 0, kx = kz; dotted line: kx = ky = kz; squares:

V. RESOLUTION CHARACTERISTICS

A. Resolution enhancement

To evaluate the performance of the designed lens, we adopt
the same method of calculating the resolution enhancement as
in [20], where the resolution enhancement was deﬁned for a
two-dimensional (planar) lens as:

Re =

kt,max
k0

ky = 0; dashed line: ky = 0, kx = kz; dotted line: kx = ky = kz; circles:
kx = ky = kz (HFSS).

IV. IMPEDANCE MATCHING

As was shown in [10], [11], the impedance matching is
crucial for the operation of the superlens. Here we use the

where kt,max is the maximum transverse wavenumber that
is transmitted from the source plane to the image plane and
k0 is the maximum transverse wavenumber corresponding to

q

propagating modes (k0
47.65 1/m for the lens that we study
here, as can be seen from Fig. 3). Because we consider a three-
dimensional lens, the transverse wavenumber is now deﬁned
as kt =

y, see Fig. 1.

≈

In [20], kt,max was derived analytically from the dimensions
of the used superlens (taking into account the effect of losses)
as well as calculated from the optical transfer function that was
derived analytically and also measured. It was concluded that a
good approximation for kt,max is the value of kt, at which the
absolute value of the optical transfer function drops to 0.5 [20].
In the following, we calculate the transmission coefﬁcient of
the lens studied in this paper using the previously derived
equations [10]. From the absolute value of the transmission
coefﬁcient (which corresponds to the optical transfer function
used in [20]) we obtain Re by ﬁnding kt,max from the plotted
curves as described above.

First, let us see how the thickness of the superlens affects
the resolution enhancement. We have calculated the resolu-
tion enhancement for the superlens described in the previous
sections, taking into account realistic losses caused by the
substrate and by the lumped elements (loss tangent of the
substrate is tan δ = 0.0012 and the quality factors of the
capacitors and inductors are 500 and 50, respectively) [11].
In the calculations, the losses can be taken into account by
using complex values for C and L and by replacing (7) by

See Fig. 7 for the resolution enhancement as a function
of the thickness of the lens (here the thickness refers to
the distance from the source plane to the image plane, i.e.,
thickness is equal to 2l). Note that when we ﬁnd kt,max
for different thicknesses, the “worst case” is always used.
Because of the fact that the impedance values are different
for different directions of propagation (see Fig. 6), kt,max
is slightly different for various propagation directions. As
expected by the results of Fig. 6,
is the smallest for
the case when kx = ky. In the calculation of Fig. 7 and in
section V B this “worst case” is used to calculate Re.

B. Bandwidth

Ideal operation of the superlens described in this paper can
be achieved only at a single frequency, as can be seen from
Fig. 3. Nevertheless, it is clear that although a small change
in the frequency distorts the image seen in the image plane,
focusing of the propagating modes and enhancement of the
evanescent modes are still expected to happen in some small
but ﬁnite frequency band. Here we rely on the assumption that
the resolution enhancement can still be deﬁned with (8), i.e.,
the distortion of the image is not very dramatic and kt,max
can still be deﬁned as described above. In the following, the
operation band is deﬁned as the frequency band where Re > 2.

Fig. 7. Resolution enhancement of the lens, as a function of the thickness of
the lens (distance between source and image) in wavelengths at the optimal
operation frequency (f = 0.8513 GHz). The larger dots show the points in
which Re was analytically calculated. Losses of the substrate and the lumped
components are taken into account.

First, let us study a lens with the thickness of the backward-
wave network being 4 unit cells and the distance between the
source and image planes being 8 unit cells. In wavelengths
this is 0.78λ at the center frequency (f = 0.8513 GHz),
0.132 m. See Fig. 8 for a plot of
because λ = 2π/k0
the transmission coefﬁcient (the absolute value). From Fig. 8
we see that the bandwidth is approximately 2 percent.

≈

Next, we make the lens thinner to see how this affects the
bandwidth. Now the thickness of the backward-wave network
is 3 unit cells and the distance between the source and image
planes is 6 unit cells. In wavelengths this is 0.58λ at the center
frequency. See Fig. 9 for the absolute value of the transmission
coefﬁcient corresponding to this case. From Fig. 9 we can
conclude that the bandwidth is approximately 6 percent.

of the transverse wavenumber. Solid line: f = 0.8513 GHz; dashed line:
f = 0.8482 GHz; dotted line: f = 0.8598 GHz. The band where Re > 2 is
approximately 2 %. The distance between the source and image planes equals
0.78λ at the center frequency.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have

shown that

three-dimensional

isotropic
a
transmission-line network can be designed in such a way that
the effective permittivity and permeability of the network are
negative (a backward-wave material). When combined with a
transmission-line network with positive effective permittivity
and permeability, the resulting device (superlens) can achieve
subwavelength resolution in a small frequency band. In this
paper we have veriﬁed the previously derived dispersion
equations by full-wave simulations and have shown that the
designed structure is isotropic in all propagation directions (not
just along the three orthogonal ones). We have also conﬁrmed
that impedance matching of the two types of networks is
possible for an arbitrary direction of propagation. We have
analytically studied the effect of losses and the physical size
on the resolution and bandwidth characteristics of the designed
lens. When high-quality, low-loss components and materials
are used, the designed lens can achieve substantial resolution
enhancement in a relative bandwidth of a few percents, with
the thickness of the lens being of the order of one wavelength.

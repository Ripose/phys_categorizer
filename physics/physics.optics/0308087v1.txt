Abstract: Quasi error-free 10 Gbit/s data transmission is demon-
strated over a novel type of 50 µm core diameter photonic crystal ﬁber
with as much as 100 m length. Combined with 850 nm VCSEL sources,
this ﬁber is an attractive alternative to graded-index multi-mode ﬁbers
for datacom applications. A comparison to numerical simulations sug-
gests that the high bit-rate may be partly explained by inter-modal
diﬀusion.

1 Introduction

Optical datacom as employed for the high-speed interconnection of electronic sub-
systems has rapidly gained importance over the past years. Vertical-cavity surface-
emitting lasers (VCSELs) emitting in the 850 nm wavelength regime and simple step-
index ﬁbers or graded-index ﬁbers are preferred key components for low-cost link solu-
tions [1]. Whereas, due to strong inter-modal dispersion, the use of the former ﬁber type
is limited to link lengths of some meters at Gbit/s data rates, fabrication of the latter
requires supreme control over the refractive index proﬁle, especially in optimized 50 µm
core diameter ﬁbers enabling up to 300 m serial transmission of 10 Gbit/s signals. Since
optical interconnect requirements move toward higher speed over shorter distances, the
availability of an easily manufacturable, yet high-speed capable ﬁber medium would be
very beneﬁcial. In this paper, we report on the properties of a new type of multi-mode
photonic crystal ﬁber (PCF) with relatively simple waveguide geometry and demon-
strate 850 nm data transmission at 10 Gbit/s over a length of L = 100 m. For a recent
review of photonic crystal ﬁbers we refer to Ref. [2] and references therein.

b ≃ 7.0 µm. Note the diﬀerent scale for the two insets.

2 Fiber design

The design of the new multi-mode photonic crystal ﬁber is illustrated in the insets
of Fig. 1 which show optical micrographs of the ﬁber cross-sections. The ﬁbers are
made from a single material (light regions), and they comprise a solid, pure silica core
suspended in air (dark regions) by narrow silica bridges of width b.

There is a large degree of freedom in engineering the optical properties and still
get ﬁber designs of practical interest from a fabrication point of view. The properties
may be tailored by adjusting parameters such as the size and shape of the core, the
dimensions and number of silica bridges, or the ﬁber material. The numerical aperture
(NA) of this type of PCF is essentially determined by the width of the silica bridges
relative to the wavelength λ as numerically demonstrated in Fig. 1. Here, we focus on
two ﬁbers with 33 µm and 50 µm core diameter and bridge widths of b = 4.8 µm and
7.0 µm, respectively, yielding NAs of around 0.07 and 0.05 at a wavelength of 850 nm.
Despite the zero-index step between the core and the bridges, the ﬁber is capable of
guiding light with good conﬁnement to the multi-mode core. This is illustrated by the
near-ﬁeld intensity distributions for both the 33 µm core PCF (Fig. 6) as well as the
50 µm core PCF (the inset in Fig. 7).

We ﬁnd that the ﬁbers can be cleaved and spliced with commercially available equip-
ment and typically, the ﬁbers have an attenuation of the order 50 dB/km at 850 nm for
typical bending radii such as 16 cm.

3 Transmission experiments

Assuming worst-case conditions [3], we estimate from the above NA-values a bit rate-
length product of around 350 MBit/s × km for the 50 µm ﬁber, whereas the 33 µm sam-
ple should have around 180 MBit/s × km. In what follows we examine the transmission
properties of such PCFs with a length of L = 100 m.

L = 100 m for the two PCFs illustrated in Fig. 1. Panel (B) shows normalized
DMD plots for both ﬁbers at oﬀset positions of −12, 0, and 12 µm.

3.1 Small-signal transfer function and DMD

In order to get a ﬁrst indication of the ﬁbers’ expected transmission bandwidths, we
have determined the small-signal frequency responses with a scalar network analyzer. As
optical source, standard 850 nm GaAs based VCSELs have been employed. The 12 µm
active diameter, oxide-conﬁned devices show transverse multi-mode emission with a
root mean square spectral width of less than 0.4 nm even under modulation. The lasing
threshold current amounts to 1.8 mA and the bias current for the small-signal as well
as data transmission experiments was chosen as 9 mA, where the 3-dB bandwidth is
8.6 GHz. At the receiving end, a multi-mode ﬁber pigtailed InGaAs pin-photo-receiver
with above 8 GHz bandwidth was used.

Panel (A) of Fig. 2 depicts the relative responses of both PCF samples. The 33 and
50 µm core PCFs show a bit rate-length product of BT × L ∼ 500 Mbit/s × km and
∼ 1000 Mbit/s × km, respectively. These ﬁgures are signiﬁcantly larger than expected
from the corresponding NAs. In the next section we extend the NA estimations and
show simulations of the modal time delays for the two PCFs.

In order to get quantitative insight into the modal delay properties, we have deter-
mined the PCFs diﬀerential mode delay (DMD) characteristics, see Panel (B) of Fig. 2.
Here, a 5 µm core diameter single-mode ﬁber is scanned over the PCF input at a dis-
tance of about 10 µm in accordance with the IEC pre-standard 60793-1-49, Sect. 3.3.
The impulse response at the output end is recorded for each oﬀset position using an

optical sampling oscilloscope with a ﬁber input compatible to 62.5 µm core diameter
multi-mode ﬁbers. A gain-switched 850 nm single-mode VCSEL delivering pulses with
less than 40 ps full width at half maximum is employed for this purpose [4]. Panel (B)
illustrates some of the results. It is seen that the output pulses of the 50 µm ﬁber are
rather narrow and virtually independent of the oﬀset position. On the other hand, those
of the 33 µm sample show larger variability and are up to twice as broad, which well
supports the above observations. Figure 3 shows two-dimensional color-coded represen-
tations of the full data.

3.2 Digital data transmission
Data transmission experiments have been carried out under non-return-to-zero 27 − 1
word length pseudo-random bit sequence modulation using the aforementioned multi-
mode VCSEL driven with 0.9 V peak-to-peak voltage. Figure 4 summarizes obtained
bit error rate (BER) curves. With the smaller core diameter ﬁber, up to 5 Gbit/s could
be transmitted without indication of a BER ﬂoor. The power penalty versus back-to-
back (BTB) operation is about 3 dB at a BER of 10−12. On the other hand, the 50 µm
ﬁber even enables 10 Gbit/s transmission over L = 100 m length with only 2.9 dB power
penalty. The observed increase in data rate is in full agreement with the small-signal
and DMD measurement results.

4 Simulations

We use a plane-wave method [5] to calculate the propagation constant βm = nmω/c
of the mth eigenmode where nm is the eﬀective index, ω the angular frequency, and
c the vacuum velocity of light. For the refractive index proﬁle we use optical micro-
graphs transformed to one-bit format representing the two-component composite air-
silica structure and for the refractive index we use a Sellmeier expression for n(ω) in
silica and n = 1 in air. The simulation of Maxwell’s equations for a given ω provides us
with sets of propagation constants {βm} and eigenﬁelds {Em} where m = 1, 2, 3, . . . M
with M as the number of guided eigenmodes. We determine M from the experimentally
measured NA which we transform to an eﬀective cladding index ncl. The number of

Fig. 5. Panel (A) shows the eﬀective indices of the M = 36 guided eigenmodes at
λ = 850 nm in the 33 µm core PCF (see upper left inset of Fig. 1). The horizontal
dashed line indicates the cladding index ncl corresponding to the experimentally
measured NA. The ﬁlled curve shows the distribution P (nm) (the projection of the
data onto the y-axis). Panel (B) shows the corresponding time-delays τm and the
distribution P (τm).

guided eigenmodes M then follows from the requirement that nM > ncl ≥ nM+1.

The delay-times (or group-delays) are given by τm = L∂βm/∂ω (we calculate the
group velocity by the approach described in Ref. [6]). The variation with m usually sets
the limit on the bit rate and in that case the bit rate-length product is given by [3, 7]

Here, we use the second moment calculated from the full statistics to characterize the
width ∆T of the distribution P (τm). For the estimate of the bit-rate the eigenmodes
are thus weighted equally corresponding to an assumption of uniform launch and at-
tenuation. In literature one often ﬁnds the estimate ∆T ≈ max{τm} − min{τm} [3, 7]
and in the ray-optical picture max{τm} can be expressed in terms of the NA in analogy
to our estimations in section 3 based on the NA. However, for a suﬃciently low
number of guided modes the beginning break-down of geometrical optics
calls for estimates based on the full statistics.

Figure 5 shows results at λ = 850 nm for the 33 µm core PCF (see upper left
inset in Fig. 1). Experimentally, this ﬁber is found to have an NA ≃ 0.07 and
the corresponding eﬀective cladding index is indicated by the dashed line in
panel (A). For the given core size this results in M = 36 eigenmodes that are
guided. Panel (B) shows the results for the time-delays with the ﬁlled curve
showing the distribution P (τm) (the projection of the data onto the y-axis)
calculated from a superposition of Gaussians with a width given by the mean
level spacing (τM − τ1)/(M − 1). We have ∆T ≃ 0.00087 × L/c corresponding to
BT × L ≃ 344 MBit/s × km which as expected is somewhat larger than the NA-
estimate. The experimentally observed value is approximately 50% larger. It
is wellknown that both non-uniform loss and attenuation as well as inter-
modal diﬀusion tends to narrow the spread in time-delays. The DMD plots in
Fig. 3 supports the presence of inter-modal diﬀusion and its dominance over
both the excitation conditions as well as variations in modal attenuation. It is
thus likely that the enhanced bit-rate length product originates from inter-
modal diﬀusion. One could speculate that stress could modify the index-
proﬁle in the silica core and that this in turn could modify the time-delay

distribution similarly to the situation in graded-index proﬁles. However, as
we shall see such a hypothesis is not supported by near-ﬁeld studies.

The electric ﬁeld E is constructed by a linear combination of the eigen-
ﬁelds. For a not too narrow linewidth of the light source we may neglect
cross-terms in |E|2 and for uniform launch and attenuation we thus expect
to measure an intensity distribution proportional to the average eigenﬁeld
M
intensity, i.e., |E|2 ≈ M −1
m |Em|2. The same will be the case for arbitrary
launch and strong inter-modal diﬀusion. Figure 6 shows the eigenﬁeld inten-
sities with spatial patterns characteristic for a close-to-hexagonal symmetry.
The average eigenﬁeld intensity in Panel (B) compares well to the experi-
mentally measured near-ﬁeld intensity in Panel (C). Together with the DMD
measurements this correspondence agrees well with a picture of inter-modal
diﬀusion which tends to populate the modes uniformly.

P

The eigenmodes fall into diﬀerent groups with diﬀerent degeneracies
(these degeneracies are slightly lifted due to a weakly broken symmetry
in the real ﬁber) as evident from both the eﬀective index in panel (A) of
Fig. 5 as well as the intensity plots (click panel (A) in Fig. 6). The ﬁrst two
eigenmodes (m = 1, 2) are the doubly degenerate fundamental mode corre-
sponding to the two polarization states of the fundamental mode in standard
ﬁbers and from a practical point of view they can be considered polarization
states though the “x-polarization” in principle has a very small y-component
and vice versa.

For the 50 µm PCF (see lower right inset of Fig. 1) with NA ≃ 0.05 we
have carried out the same analysis of the eﬀective index and found that
M = 20 eigenmodes are guided. Since M increases with both increasing NA
and core size, M can be low even for a large core as long as the NA is not
too high. Figure 7 shows results for the time-delay which as expected has
a more narrow distribution compared to the results for the PCF with the
33 µm core, see panel (B) of Fig. 5. The width ∆T ≃ 0.00054 × L/c corresponds
to BT × L ≃ 559 MBit/s × km. The experimental value is larger by more than
70% which is attributed to inter-modal diﬀusion.

5 Conclusions

For the ﬁrst time, quasi error-free transmission of 10 Gbit/s digital data
signals over a multi-mode photonic crystal ﬁber with 50 µm core diameter
and as much as 100 m length has been demonstrated. With some optimiza-
tions concerning design and fabrication, these PCFs show good prospects
as an alternative to graded-index ﬁbers in optical datacom environments.
Comparing to numerical simulations indicates that the high bit-rate may be
partly supported by inter-modal diﬀusion.

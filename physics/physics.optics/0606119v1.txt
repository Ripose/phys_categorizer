Abstract

The absorption and extinction spectra of sub-wavelength cylinder arrays are shown to present

two diﬀerent kind of resonances. Close to the Rayleigh anomalies, the diﬀractive coupling with the

lattice periodicity leads to sharp peaks in the extinction spectra with characteristic Fano line shapes

for both s and p-polarizations. When the material exhibits an absorption line or in the presence

of localized surface plasmon/polaritons, the system is shown to present resonant absorption with

wider and symmetric line shapes. For s-polarization our analysis predict a theoretical limit of

50% of absorption. Interestingly, for p-polarized light and an appropriate choice of parameters, a

subwavelength cylinder array can present perfect (100%) absorption.

The study of the extinction spectra of nanoparticles have drawn much attention recently

for their potential applications to chemical and biological sensors as well as for Surface

Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) [1–3]. While for a single nanoparticle, the excitation

of localized surface plasmon/polariton resonances (LSPR) lead to well deﬁned extinction

line shapes at speciﬁc wavelengths[2], for an assemble of nanoparticles the spectra can be

substantially modiﬁed by multiple scattering eﬀects. For absorbing materials, resonant

radiative diﬀraction as well as resonant absorption processes could both lead to sharp peaks in

the extinction spectra. Our main purpose is to understand the relative role of both processes

in the spectra of nanoparticle arrays. This is an important issue from a fundamental point

of view but it is also specially relevant for a wide range of applications: By Kirchhoﬀ’s

law [4], the control of absorption by nanostructured materials is equivalent to tailor the

thermal emission. This is of interest for thermophotovoltaic applications and for the design

of eﬃcient infrared sources. The recent development of coherent thermal sources [5, 6] has

stimulated further work on thermal emission from photonic crystals [7–9] or nanoparticle

arrays [10].

In the visible range, plasmon resonances on linear array of metallic particles have been in-

tensively studied considering the inﬂuence of diﬀerent parameters on the extinction spectra

[11–13]. Enhanced absorption by dielectric particles resulting of phonon-polariton reso-

nances has also been demonstrated in the infrared [14]. Peaks in the extinction spectra are

commonly associated to the excitation of LSPR modiﬁed by the diﬀractive coupling with the

lattice periodicity [13, 14]. For cylinder arrays, s-polarized electromagnetic radiation (with

the electric ﬁeld parallel to the cylinder axis) can not excite any surface plasmon. However,

the extinction spectra of subwavelength cylinder arrays of non-absorbing dielectric materials

present sharp peaks even for s-polarization [15].

In this letter, we study the extinction spectra of sub-wavelength cylinder arrays. As we

will see, the spectra present two diﬀerent kind of resonances. Close to the Rayleigh anoma-

lies, the diﬀractive coupling with the lattice periodicity leads to sharp peaks in the extinction

spectra with characteristic Fano line shapes for both s and p-polarizations. These geometric

resonances, associated to radiative coupling in absence of absorption, may lead to resonant

absorption for appropriate grating parameters. We analytically derive the conditions for

resonant absorption as a function of the geometry and material’s parameters. Another kind

of absorption resonances, with wider and symmetric line shapes, appears when the material

2

exhibits an absorption line or in the presence of LSPRs. In contrast with geometric reso-

nances, these absorption peaks are almost isotropic with a weak dependence on the angle of

incidence and geometry. We will demonstrate that for s-polarization there is a theoretical

limit of 50% of absorption. Interestingly, we will show that, for p-polarized light and an ap-

propriate choice of parameters, a subwavelength cylinder array can present perfect (100%)

absorption.

FIG. 1: (s-polarization ) Extinction in s-polarization in a map of frequency (D/λ) versus the

transversal momentum of the incoming radiation (Q0 = 2π sin θ/λ), for an array of SiC nanocylin-

ders with period D = 4.5µm and radius a = 0.2µm. Around D/λ =0.36 (λ = 12.5µm), there is an

isotropic extinction peak due to the absorption line of SiC. The inset shows the extinction spec-

trum, which exhibits a typical Fano line shape, for an incident angle θ = 15o around the geometric

resonance (close to the ﬁrst Rayleigh frequency, i.e. D/λ = 1 − Q0D/2π).

Let us consider an inﬁnite set of parallel cylinders with their axis along the z-axis (see
inset in Fig. 1), relative dielectric constant ǫ = ǫ′ + iǫ′′ and radius a much smaller than the

wavelength. The cylinders are located at rn = nDux = xnux (with n an integer number). For

simplicity, we will assume incoming plane waves with wave vector k0⊥uz ( i.e. the ﬁelds do

not depend on the z-coordinate), with k = ω/c and k0 = k sin θ ux+k cos θ uy ≡ Q0ux+q0uy.

The reﬂectance, R and transmittance, T of the cylinder array can be calculated by using

a standard multiple scattering approach in the dipolar approximation [16], as described in

Ref. [15]. We deﬁne the absorptivity, A, as: A ≡ 1 − R − T and the normalized extinction,

E, as the ratio between scattered plus absorbed powers and incoming power (notice that,

3

below the onset of the ﬁrst diﬀraction beam, the extinction is simply given by the sum of

absorption and specular reﬂection, E = A + R ).

Let us ﬁrst consider the simpler case of s-polarized electromagnetic waves. For a single

sub-wavelength cylinder, the polarizability is given by

Silicon carbide (SiC) nanowires provide a simple model system:
its dielectric constant is
given by this form with the following parameters [20]: ǫ∞ = 6.7, ωL = 1.825 1014 rad.s−1,
ωT = 1.494 1014 rad.s−1, γ = 8.9662 1011 rad.s−1. Figure 1 displays the extinction in the

infrared range,

in a map of frequency (D/λ) versus the transversal momentum of the

incoming radiation (Q0), for an array of SiC cylinders (with D = 4.5 µm and a = 0.2 µm).

The extinction spectra show two diﬀerent kinds of resonances:

strong dependence on the angle of incidence, and ii) a broad peak close to the absorption

line of SiC (ω ≈ ωT ) which is almost isotropic. The peaks in the extinction spectra correlate

with corresponding maxima in the absorption. However, the relative strength of the peaks

depends on the material and geometrical parameters. This is illustrated in Fig.2 where we

have plotted the real part of 1/αzz and the imaginary parts of αzz (2a), the absorptivity

(2b) and the extinction (2c) versus the wavelength for an incident angle θ = 15o an for

diﬀerent lattice constants, D (the inset in Fig. 1 corresponds to a zoom of the bold solid

line in Fig. 2c).

The diﬀerent extinction/absorption resonances resemble the recently discussed “lattice”

[15, 21] and “site” [22] resonances in absence of absorption. Resonant processes arise when

the real part of 1/(k2αzz) − Gb vanishes. Approaching the threshold of the ﬁrst propagating
1 − ω2)−1/2c/(2D) and can
(diﬀraction) channel, the real part of Gb goes to inﬁnity as ≈ (ω2
compensate exactly the real part of 1/k2αzz giving rise to a “geometric” resonance [15, 17].
This can only happen when the real part of the polarizability is positive (ǫ′ > 1). As a

consequence, in s-polarization there is no resonant absorption for metallic cylinders. The

typical Fano line shape of these resonances is illustrated in the inset of Fig. 1. While it is

possible to obtain a 100% extinction of the beam ( due to the reﬂection resonances which

appear when the absorption is weak [15] ), the maximum absorption Amax is limited to a 50

% (see Fig.2(b,c)). It is easy to show that the highest absorption, Amax = 1/2, takes place

below the ﬁrst Rayleigh frequency when

Cǫ′′ =

ǫ′′
π(ka)2|ǫ − 1|2 =

.

(5)

This is one of the central results of this work. We can also notice that at the Rayleigh

frequency, ω = ω1, the array of cylinders is transparent as the absorption and the extinction

goes to zero.

Material or “site” resonances are associated to the zeros of the real part of 1/αzz. As

shown in Fig.2(a), it exhibits two zeros, one close to ω ≃ ωT the other to ω ≃ ωS =

(ǫ∞ω2

L − ω2

T )/(ǫ∞ − 1). The second one corresponds to a small value of ℑ{αzz}, which leads

to a weak absorption. The broad resonances in Figure 2(b) and (c) coincide with a maximum

of ℑ{αzz} and correspond to a resonant absorption of the material. Then, they should not

be very sensitive to the lattice parameters and order. However, the maximal absorptivity

value of 1/2 can only be reached at the condition given by eq. 5. Close to the Rayleigh

polaritons or plasmon-polaritons for metals) LSPR (for SiC, λP = 10.57µm). In contrast

with the geometric resonances, the LSPR will lead to the resonance of both dipoles. As each

dipole can contribute up to 1/2, the absorption may reach 100%.

be very sensible to the lattice parameters. Together with this condition , it can be easily

shown that the other condition to reach the maximal absorption is q0 = Q0(θ = 45o). We

represent in Fig.2(e) and (f), respectively the absorption and extinction spectra of an array

of SiC cylinders with a radius of a = 0.5 µm and for an incident angle of θ = 45o and

several periods. Similarly to s-polarization, there are two kinds of resonances, (1) geometric

resonance characterized by very sharp peaks at wavelengths close to Rayleigh frequencies,

(2) a broader double peak at a wavelength λ ≃ λP . This double peak corresponds to the

resonances of the y− and x−dipoles, (red or blue) shifted depending on the sign (+ or -) of
y Gb. As discussed above, ≈ 100% absorption takes place only when ∂2

no geometric resonances. This explains the anomalous shape of the LSPR extinction peak

for D = 6.15 µm (black bold solid line in Fig.2(f)), as the Rayleigh frequency (λ = 10.5 µm)

lies in a range where ℜ{1/αd} . 0. At this wavelength, we can just observe the (y−dipole)

Rayleigh transparency dip in the extinction spectrum (see also Fig. 3). These results provide

a simple and analytical explanation of the anomalous shape of the extinction peaks observed

in recent numerical simulations [13].

In conclusion, this paper gives a simple analytical method to derive the optical proper-

ties of sub-wavelength cylinders arrays. We have shown that in s-polarization, absorption

resonances can absorb up to half of the incident power. The absorption and extinction

spectra for p-polarization presents a more complex structure due to the contribution of two

orthogonal dipoles. It is remarkable that, as we have shown, by an appropriate choice of

parameters a subwavelength cylinder array can become a perfect absorber. We believe that

our analysis paves a new way for the nanoengineering of chemical and biological sensors and

photo-thermal devices based on nanoparticle arrays.

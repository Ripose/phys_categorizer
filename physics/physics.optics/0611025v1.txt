The transition from spatial to spatiotemporal dynamics in Kerr-driven beam collapse is modelled
as the instability of the Townes proﬁle. Coupled axial and conical radiation, temporal splitting and
X waves appear as the eﬀect of Y-shaped unstable modes, whose growth is experimentally detected.

From light ﬁlaments to Bose Einstein condensates
(BEC), from plasma instabilities to hydrodynamical or
optical shocks, many nonlinear wave processes lead to
self-compression with catastrophic increase in peak in-
tensity, followed by relaxation to a linear state. Uni-
versal properties of the compression dynamic were dis-
covered by analyzing the blowup of self-focusing solu-
tions to the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (NSE) [1],
described as a self-similar collapse to a smooth and sym-
metric ground state [2]. Though wave-packets evolve in
the three-dimensional (3D) space, uneven initial condi-
tions and compression rates typically lead to symmetry
breaking, featured by a transient compression towards a
sub-dimensional eigenstate. In light-beam self-focusing,
self-similar collapse to the Townes proﬁle (TP), or ground
state of the NSE in two spatial dimensions [3], has been
recently observed [4]. As to the subsequent expansion,
3D (space-time) X-waves were shown to capture the ap-
parent stationarity, the pulse-splitting and the conical
emission (CE) in the ﬁlamentation regime [5, 6]. Up to
date, however, the mechanisms that support the transi-
tion from the quasi-2D, self-similar collapse to the 3D
relaxation regime remain unrevealed.

A possible approach to this problem requires retain-
ing all highly nonlinear eﬀects relevant to this transition
phase in a suitably “dressed” NSE. Here we show that the
collapse-driven “morphology” transition from the domi-
nant 2D to the 3D dynamics can be described in the
frame of the bare 3D NSE model by the 3D (space-time)
instability of the 2D TP eigensate. Up to date, transverse
instability was investigated only for the 1D NSE eigen-
state [7, 8], which however does not support collapse.
Our analysis directly applies to light ﬁlaments generated
by fs pulses in normally dispersive Kerr media, but can be
generalized straightforwardly to the collapse in anoma-
lous dispersion, the spatiotemporal (ST) instability of
χ(2) solitons and the collapse of sub-dimensional localized
structures in plasmas and BEC. The results capture the
key steps of the entire ﬁlament evolution from the input
Gaussian to the ﬁnal X waves, and explain the coupling
between axial and CE. These were regarded as two inde-
pendent processes, until recent numerical investigations
outlined their simultaneous appearance [9]. Here the cou-
pling emerges as an intrinsic feature of the instability of

the TP, whose signature is a couple of Y-shaped unsta-
ble modes. For the ﬁrst time, a theory is provided that
links ﬁlamentation, CE, pulse-splitting and supercontin-
uum generation to the singular behavior at collapse.

The physical quantities featuring the collapsing dy-
namics are the growing perturbations pκ and p−κ⋆ com-
posed of u and v. In particular, the ST spectrum Q–Ω
of the unstable perturbations at a certain propagation
distance ζ will be generally expressed by a superposition
of the type σκ(Ω)ˆpκ(Q, Ω) + σ−κ⋆ (Ω)ˆp−κ⋆ (Q, Ω), where
ˆpκ(Q, Ω) and ˆp−κ⋆ (Q, Ω) are the spatial Fourier trans-
forms of pκ(ρ, Ω) and p−κ⋆ (ρ, Ω), and σκ(Ω) and σ−κ⋆ (Ω)
are the seeds of each unstable perturbation at each fre-
quency.
In experiments, measurement of the ST spec-
trum Q–Ω (in practice, the angularly-resolved spectrum,
displaying angles and wavelengths) of a light ﬁlament is
a powerful diagnostic in which axial and CE can be visu-
alized at once [11]. For the TP, the structure of the Q–Ω
spectrum of instability can be inferred from the above
asymptotic analysis. The spectrum ˆpκ(Q, Ω) is composed
of ˆu(Q, Ω) at positive frequency shift Ω and expectedly
peaked at Qu, and of ˆv⋆(Q, Ω) at negative frequency shift
Ω and peaked at Qv (if the respective decay rates Γu,v
−
are not large). Plotting Qu and Qv given by (5) versus
frequency in their respective ranges, we obtain the black,
thick solid curve of Fig. 2(a). This curve is expected
to locate the regions in the Q–Ω plane where ˆpκ(Q, Ω)
takes its highest values. Fig. 2(a) shows also the values
of Γu and Γv (black, thin solid curve). Since exponen-
1), the branch Qv,
tial localization of v is weak (Γv ≪
√2 Ω, is
ﬁtting approximately the linear relation Qv ≃ −
expected to deﬁne the locus of maxima of ˆv(Q, Ω), and
hence ˆpκ(Q, Ω) at down-shifted frequencies to describe an
actual oﬀ-axis, CE. Instead, localization of u is similar to
1) and Qu close to zero, which sug-
that of the TP (Γu ∼
gests to associate ˆpκ(Q, Ω) at up-shifted frequencies with
an axial emission. Similar analysis holds for ˆp−κ⋆(Q, Ω),
CE being now associated with up-shifted frequencies, and
axial emission with down-shifted frequencies [see Fig.
2(a), black, dashed curves]. This characterization of the
instability spectrum is conﬁrmed by numerical evaluation
of u and v. Fig. 2(b) shows ˆpκ(Q, Ω) with the expected
features. Its reﬂection about Ω = 0 yields ˆp−κ⋆(Q, Ω).

The instability of the TP then reveals the link between
axial and CE. In this view, the basic ingredients of the
ST spectrum of a light ﬁlament are not the axial contin-
uum and the X-shaped CE, but two Y-shaped objects,
each one coupling oﬀ-axis emission to axial emission on
opposite frequency bands.

Let us compare these results with those for the ST in-
stability of the plane wave solution A = exp(iζ) to the
NSE [12]. The problem (3) holds for this case if the
amplitude a0 and the nonlinear wave vector shift α are
replaced by unity, and presents the same symmetries.
The eigenmodes u and v associated with the most unsta-
ble perturbations pκ and p−κ⋆ at each frequency Ω are
two plane waves with identical transverse wave numbers
Qu = Qv = √Ω2 + 2. The gain
κI = 1 is indepen-
dent of Ω and hence unbounded. The spectra ˆpκ(Q, Ω)
and ˆp−κ⋆(Q, Ω) are then characterized by two identical
hyperbolas, depicted in Fig. 2(a) as a single green curve
(see Ref. [12]), and usually referred to as an X-like spec-
trum. The slope of the X arms is unity, while that of the
Y arm is √2 (
0 in physical units).
Degeneracy breaking from single X to double Y and
gain limitation originate from the transverse localization
of the TP. To see this more intuitively, we interpret insta-
bility as originated from a Kerr-driven, degenerate four-
wave-mixing (FWM) interaction in which two intense,
identical pump waves of frequency Ω = 0 propagating
along the ζ direction, amplify two weak, non-collinear
plane waves, u and v, at frequencies
Ω. Each pump
wave propagates with an axial wave number shift kNL
(with respect to a plane wave of frequency Ω = 0) due
to self-phase modulation (SPM). The axial wave num-
bers of the weak plane waves are shifted by Ω2/2
u/2
and Ω2/2
v/2 [as obtained from the linearized NSE
(1)] due to material dispersion and tilt, and by kNL,u and
kNL,v due to cross-phase modulation (XPM). Axial phase
matching among the interacting waves then reads as

For plane wave pumps, SPM and XPM wave number

Axial and transverse phase-matching (Q2

be strictly enforced for eﬃcient ampliﬁcation of u and v,
which lead to Qu,v = √Ω2 + 2, i.e., to the X-like spec-

Suppose, instead, that the pumps have TPs (kNL = α).
To account for transverse localization, a) we will assume

It follows from our analysis that the onset of down-
shifted axial emission must be accompanied by upshifted
CE, and vice versa, and that these two events may occur
independently. Our simulations and experiments support
this interpretation. Figure 3(a) shows the ST spectrum
of a TP that is not a CW but a pulse. This “perturbed”
TP is moreover asymmetric in time by choosing diﬀerent
durations for the leading and trailing parts (∆τ = 0.87
and 29, respectively). In Fig. 3(b) the diﬀerence between
the propagated spectrum under the NSE (1) (distance
ζ = 7.6) and the input spectrum is shown in order to
visualize the newly generated frequencies. A single Y-
shaped structure is formed, with a slope of the conical
part ﬁtting to √2 (thick line).

In the experiments, we used a 15 cm-long fused sil-
ica sample as Kerr media. 200-fs-long pulses at 527 nm
delivered from a 10 Hz Nd:glass mode-locked and regen-
eratively ampliﬁed system (Twinkle, Light Conversion),
were spatially ﬁltered and focused with a 50 cm focal
length lens. The pulses then entered into the sample,
whose input facet was placed at 52 cm from the lens,
and formed a single ﬁlament for input energies E >
2 µJ.
∼
Angularly resolved spectra of the ﬁlament at the output
facet and from single laser shots were measured with an
imaging spectrometer and a CCD camera, as described
in [11]. At 2 µJ in fused silica the ﬁlament is formed
just before the output facet of the sample, the Y-shaped

Extending our analysis, we may venture an explana-
tion to the fact that two X-waves are commonly observed
at later stages of propagation [5, 6]. Consider, within
the FWM approach, the possible eﬀects on the instabil-
ity spectrum of the strong temporal localization of the
pump, as may take place upon (possibly multiple) split-
ting. For a spatially and temporally localized pump of
central frequency Ω = 0, axial wave vector shift kNL due
to SPM, and propagating at a group velocity v(g) dif-
ferent from that of a plane pulse at Ω = 0 (as for an
Y-wave), new plane waves u and v at opposite frequen-
Ω are expected to be preferentially ampliﬁed if in

In conclusion, Y-waves feature the MI of the TP and
constitute the missing links between self-similar spatial
self-focusing and ST collapse driven dynamics. Y-waves
model the coupling between axial and CE, and allow us
to interpret temporal splitting, X-wave formation and ﬁ-
nal relaxation into linear X-waves. These results provide
a uniﬁed view of ultrashort pulse ﬁlamentation and are
relevant to all systems involving ST coupling and nonlin-
earity such as χ(2) solitons, BEC, etc.

The faster growth of one of the two unstable perturba-

Performance of DPSK Signals with Quadratic
Phase Noise

Keang-Po Ho∗†

January 11, 2014

Abstract

Nonlinear phase noise induced by the interaction of ﬁber Kerr eﬀect
and ampliﬁer noises is a quadratic function of the electric ﬁeld. When
the dependence between the additive Gaussian noise and the quadratic
phase noise is taking into account, the error probability for diﬀerential
phase-shift keying (DPSK) signals is derived analytically. Depending
on the number of ﬁber spans, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) penalty
is increased by up to 0.23 dB due to the dependence between the Gaus-
sian noise and the quadratic phase noise.

Keywords: phase modulation, error probability, ﬁber Kerr eﬀects, non-

linear phase noise

Introduction

Other than the projection of additive Gaussian noise to the phase, phase
noises from other sources can be considered as multiplicative noise that adds
directly to the phase of the received signal. When the local oscillator is not
locked perfectly into the signal, the noisy reference gives additive phase
noise [1, 2]. Laser phase noise degrades coherent optical communication
systems [3–5]. Those types of extra additive phase noise that add directly
In
into the signal phase are independent of the additive Gaussian noise.

this paper, the additive phase noise is quadratic function of the electric
ﬁeld. When the electric ﬁeld is contaminated with additive Gaussian noise,
although the quadratic phase noise is uncorrelated with the linear phase
noise, both non-Gaussian distributed, the phase noise weakly depends on
the additive Gaussian noise.

Diﬀerential phase-shift keying (DPSK) signals [6–16] have received re-
newed attention recently for long-haul or spectrally eﬃciency lightwave trans-
mission systems. When optical ampliﬁers are used periodically to com-
pensate the ﬁber loss, the interaction of optical ampliﬁer noise and ﬁber
Kerr eﬀect induced nonlinear phase noise, often called Gordon-Mollenauer
eﬀect [17], or more precisely, nonlinear phase noise induced by self-phase
modulation. Added directly into the signal phase, Gordon-Mollenauer ef-
fect is a quadratic function of the electric ﬁeld and degrades DPSK sig-
nal [11, 14, 17–23].

Previous studies found the variance or the corresponding Q-factor of
the quadratic phase noise [11, 17, 24–27] or the spectral broadening of the
signal [14, 18, 28]. Recently, quadratic phase noise is found to be non-
Gaussian distributed both experimentally [20] and theoretically [29, 30]. As
non-Gaussian random variable, neither the variance nor Q-factor is suﬃ-
cient to completely characterize the phase noise. The probability density of
quadratic phase noise is found in [30] and used in [23] to evaluate the er-
ror probability of DPSK signal by assuming that quadratic phase noise and
Gaussian noise are independent of each other. However, as shown in the sim-
ulation of [22, 23], the dependence between Gaussian noise with quadratic
phase noise increases the error probability.

Using the distributed assumption of inﬁnite number of ﬁber spans, the
joint statistics of nonlinear phase noise and Gaussian noise is derived analyt-
ically by [19,21,31]. The characteristic function of nonlinear phase noise be-
comes a very simple expression with the distributed assumption [29]. The er-
ror probability of DPSK signal has been derived with [22] and without [21,32]
the assumption that nonlinear phase noise is independent of the Gaussian
noise. Based on the distributed assumption, it is found that the dependence
between linear and nonlinear phase noise increases both the error probability
and SNR penalty [21, 32].

The distributed assumption is very accurate when the number of ﬁber
spans is larger than 32 [21, 29]. For a typical ﬁber span length of 80 km,
a ﬁber link of 32 spans has a total distance of over 2500 km. Most ter-
restrial ﬁber systems have an overall distance of less than 1000 km, the
distributed assumption needs to be veriﬁed for small number of ﬁber spans.
Recently, DPSK signals have been used in systems with small number of

2

ﬁber spans [16,33,34]. Of course, the independence assumption can be used
for either small [23] or large [22] number of ﬁber spans. However, as shown
in [21, 32], the independence assumption of [22, 23] underestimates both the
error probability and the required SNR, contradicting to the principles of
conservative system design.

In this paper, taking into account the dependence between the quadratic
phase noise and Gaussian noise, the error probability of DPSK signal is
derived for ﬁnite number of ﬁber spans, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst time.
Comparing with the independence approximation of [23], the dependence
between the quadratic phase noise and Gaussian noise increases the error
probability of the system.

In the remaining parts of this paper, Sec. 2 gives the model of the
quadratic phase noise, mostly follows the approaches of [30]; Sec. 3 derives
the joint statistics of the additive Gaussian noise and the quadratic phase
noise; Using the joint statistics, Sec. 4 gives the exact error probability of
DPSK signals with quadratic phase noise, taking into account the depen-
dence between the additive Gaussian noise and quadratic phase noise; Sec.
5 calculates the error probability and the SNR penalty of DPSK signals,
and compared with the independence approximation of [23]; Sec. 6 is the
conclusion of the paper.

2 Quadratic Nonlinear Phase Noise

For an N -span systems, for simplicity and without loss of generality, the
overall quadratic phase noise is [17, 25, 26, 30]

where ~E0 = (A, 0) is a two-dimensional vector as the baseband represen-
tation of the transmitted electric ﬁeld, ~nk, k = 1, . . . , N , are independent
identically distributed (i.i.d.) zero-mean circular Gaussian random complex
numbers as the optical ampliﬁer noise introduced into the system at the kth
ﬁber span. Both electric ﬁeld of ~E0 and ampliﬁer noises of ~nk in (1) can also

be represented as complex number. The variance of ~nk is E
k = 1, . . . , N , where σ2
0 is the noise variance per span per dimension. In
(1), the constant factor of the product of ﬁber nonlinear coeﬃcient and the
eﬀective nonlinear length per span, γLeﬀ , is ignored for simplicity. Without
aﬀected the SNR, both signal and noise in (1) can be scaled by the same

except the case without quadratic phase noise of <ΦNL>= 0. After the scal-
ing, the mean nonlinear phase shift is approximately equal to the product of
number of ﬁber spans and the launched power per span, especially for the
usual case of large SNR with small noise.

In the linear regime, ignoring the ﬁber loss of the last span and the
ampliﬁer gain required to compensate it, the signal received after N spans

range of [

with a period of 2π. If the characteristic function of the received phase is

Figure 1: The error probability of DPSK signal as a function of SNR for
N =1, 2, 4, 8, 32, and inﬁnite number of ﬁber spans and mean nonlinear
phase shift of <ΦNL>= 0.5 rad.

The error probability expression of (26) is almost the same as that in
[21, 32] but with a diﬀerent parameter of (27). The error probability of
(26) is also similar to the cases when additive phase noise is independent to
Gaussian noise [2, 3, 23, 40, 41]. The frequency depending SNR is originated
from the dependence between the additional phase noise and the Gaussian
noise [19, 21, 32, 37].

5 Numerical Results

For DPSK signals with quadratic phase noise, Figure 1 shows the exact
error probability as a function of SNR ρs for mean nonlinear phase shift of
<ΦNL>= 0.5 rad. Figure 2 shows the SNR penalty for an error probability
of 10−9 as a function of mean nonlinear phase shift < ΦNL >. The SNR
penalty is deﬁned as the additional required SNR to achieve the same error
probability of 10−9. Both Figs. 1 and 2 are calculated using (26) and the
independence approximation of [23]. The independence approximation of
[23] underestimates both the error probability and SNR penalty of a DPSK
signal with quadratic phase noise of (1). Both Figs. 1 and 2 also include the

model from [32] and [22], respectively. The distributed model is applicable
when the number of ﬁber spans is larger than 32. In Fig. 1, without quadratic
phase noise of <ΦNL>= 0, the error probability is pe = exp(
ρs)/2 [42].
The required SNR for systems without nonlinear phase noise of <ΦNL>= 0
is ρs = 20 (13 dB) for an error probability of 10−9.

From Figs. 1 and 2, for the same mean nonlinear phase shift of <ΦNL>,
the SNR penalty is larger for smaller number of ﬁber spans. When the mean
nonlinear phase shift is <ΦNL>= 0.56 rad, the SNR penalty is about 1 dB
with large number (N > 32) of ﬁber spans but up to 3-dB SNR penalty
for small number (N = 1, 2) of ﬁber spans. For 1-dB SNR penalty, the
mean nonlinear phase shift is also reduced from 0.56 to 0.35 rad with small
number of ﬁber spans.

In [17], the optimal operating point is deﬁned when the variance of
quadratic phase noise is approximately equal to the variance of the phase
of Gaussian noise. In [22, 23], the optimal operating is calculated rigorously
at the operation condition in which the increase of launched power does not
improve the system performance. The optimal operating point is reduced
from 0.97 to 0.55 rad with the decrease of the number of ﬁber spans.

independence assumption of [22, 23] underestimates the error probability
of the system, contradicting to the conservative principle of system design.
The dependence between linear and nonlinear phase noise increases the SNR
penalty up to 0.23 dB.

From the SNR penalty of Fig. 2, if a prior penalty of about 0.23 dB is
added into the system, the independence assumption of [23] can be used to
provide a conservative system design guideline.

6 Conclusion

For a system with small number of ﬁber spans, the exact error probability
of a DPSK signal with quadratic phase noise is derived analytically the ﬁrst
time when the dependence between linear and nonlinear phase noise is taking
into account. For the same mean nonlinear phase shift, the error probability
increases for small number of ﬁber spans. The dependence between linear
and nonlinear phase noises increases the error probability for DPSK signals.
Depending on the number of ﬁber spans, the SNR penalty increases by up
to 0.23 dB due to the dependence between Gaussian noise and the quadratic
phase noise.

For the same mean nonlinear phase shifts and SNR, the error probability
of the system increases with the decrease of the number of ﬁber spans. As an
example, the optimal operating point for system with large number (N > 32)
is a mean nonlinear phase shift of about 1 rad that is reduced to about 0.55
rad for system with small number of ﬁber spans (N = 1, 2).

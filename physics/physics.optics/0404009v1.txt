An algebraic approach to neutron scattering on a one dimensional potentials is gener-

alized to diﬀraction on three dimensional single crystals.

I hate and will always hate dynamical diﬀraction
R.Golub

1 Introduction

I feel a solidarity with R.Golub with respect to the standard dynamical diﬀraction theory,
because for me it was always so boring to explain diﬀraction eﬀects by motion of some points
along mathematical dispersion surfaces. Here I want to present an alternative theory, which
has a clear physical meaning at every step. My approach is similar to that of [1, 2].

1.1 Algebra of neutron scattering on two semitransparent mirrors

To explain the approach, let’s consider reﬂection and transmission of a system of two separated
semitransparent mirrors. We consider our primary neutron to be described by a plane wave
ψ0(k, r, t), and two mirrors — by two diﬀerent potentials u1,2, separated by a distance l as
shown in ﬁg. 1. If we know reﬂection r1,2 and transmission t1,2 amplitudes of every separate
mirror, we can ﬁnd reﬂection R12 and transmission T12 of both mirrors.

Suppose the amplitude of the incident wave exp(ikx) on the surface of the ﬁrst mirror at
x = 0 is equal to unity at the surface x = 0 of the ﬁrst mirror. Let’s denote X the amplitude
of the wave incident on the surface of the second mirror (see ﬁg. 1). For X we can construct
an equation

X = exp(ikl)t1 + exp(ikl)r1 exp(ikl)r2X.

(1)

The second wave in the right hand side is generated by the X: the incident wave with amplitude
X reﬂects from the second mirror, goes to the ﬁrst one, reﬂects from the ﬁrst mirror, and arrives
to the second one. During propagations between mirrors the wave acquires the phase factor
exp(ikl). At the second mirror the second term of (1) superposes with the wave, which is
transmitted through the ﬁrst mirror and is represented by the ﬁrst term in the right hand side.
The sum of two waves according to deﬁnition is equal to X.

Reﬂected wave is a superposition of two waves. The ﬁrst one is related to the wave directly
reﬂected from the ﬁrst mirror, and the second one, is related to the wave X, which after
reﬂection from the second mirror arrives to the ﬁrst one and transmits through it. Substitution
of X into (2) gives

This result is a discovery [3]. It shows that an arbitrary potential can at any point be split into
two parts. If both parts are symmetrical, we get (5). However the potential and its parts, as
is shown in ﬁg. 2, are in general nonsymmetrical. In that case reﬂection ri and transmission ti
amplitudes from the left and from the right are in general diﬀerent, so formulas (5) are to be
changed as follows

1.2 Properties of reﬂection and transmission amplitudes

1.2.1 Nonsymmetric potentials

To ﬁnd the diﬀerence of amplitudes for waves incident from the left and from the right it is
suﬃcient to consider the simplest nonsymmetric potential, which consists of two symmetrical
ones as shown in ﬁg. 3.

Transmission and reﬂection of the total potential are given by (5). From them we can

1.3 An example of application of the above algebra

One of the simplest is a rectangular potential shown in ﬁg. 4.
If we denote the amplitude
of wave incident upon the right edge of the rectangle from inside the barrier, we can ﬁnd an

2 One dimensional periodic potential

Now we consider one dimensional periodic potentials. Our goal is to ﬁnd reﬂection RN and
transmission TN amplitudes of an arbitrary periodic potential, containing N periods, if we know
respective amplitudes r and t for a single period. However we start with semiinﬁnite periodic
potential shown in ﬁg. 5. In ﬁg. 5 we see an incident wave from the left, and the reﬂected wave
with an amplitude R. We also see the amplitude X of the wave incident on the second period.
For X and R we can immediately write the equations

X = t + rRX,

R = r + tRX.

(13)

For simplicity we assume that the period is symmetric.
In writing of this system we used
(1) and (3) for l = 0 and took into account that reﬂection from the semiinﬁnite potential
without one period is the same as from the whole potential. Our system has a very interesting
symmetry: the equations transform to each other when we exchange r and t.

We can resolve the ﬁrst equation with respect to X and substitute it into the second. As a

result we obtain the equation

which can be reduced to the form y2

2.1 The ﬁnite number of periods N

To ﬁnd RN and TN it is suﬃcient to take into account that a semiinﬁnite potential with period
a is also periodic with period Na, and the Bloch phase factor of such a periodic potential is
X N = exp(iqNa). With this in mind we rewrite the system (13) in the form

X N = TN + RN RX N ,

R = RN + TN RX N ,

where we replaced r and t by RN and TN . The system (19) can be resolved with respect to RN
and TN . As a result we obtain

2.2 Practical application

The method demonstrated here can be used for preparation of mirrors with desirable properties.
In particular, to increase critical angle we need to prepare a supermirror, which consists of
several periodic chains with diﬀerent periods and diﬀerent number of periods [9]. One can also
prepare a monochromatic mirror, which reﬂects particles of given energy. For that we need
only to prepare a periodic system with some special period, giving Bragg diﬀraction at some
energy. To exclude Bragg reﬂection of higher order the single period of the chain must be of a
special form, which can be well calculated [6].

The method is not restricted to scalar particles.

It can be used for neutrons with spin
in magnetic ﬁelds [8], for x-rays, and for elastic waves, and even for investigation of particles
diﬀusion and moderation.

More over it can be used, and we demonstrate it in the next section, for description of

diﬀraction in single crystals. With it we have the new dynamical diﬀraction theory [10].

3 Diﬀraction in a single crystal

Interaction of neutrons with media containing atoms in ﬁxed positions is described with the
help of multiple wave scattering (MWS) theory. According to it the neutron wave function
scattered from a single atom at point r = ri is

This is the main system of equations of MWS theory. If we solve it, we ﬁnd ψn, substitute
into (22) and ﬁnd the ﬁnal waves scattered by our set of atoms.

3.1 Scattering from a single crystalline plane

We can solve this system, when atoms are identical (bn = b) and arranged regularly on a single
inﬁnite plane, which we suppose to coincide with coordinate (x, y)-plane. For simplicity we can
imagine the elementary cell of atoms to be a square with side a. From symmetry considerations
the solution of the system (23) is

where rn = an, n = (nx, ny, 0) and nx,y are integers. Substitution of (24) into (23) with bn = b
gives C = 1/(1 + bS), where S is the sum

ψn = C exp(ikrn),

S =

which was calculated in [4], and we do not reproduce it here.

where N2 = 1/a2 is the density of atoms on the plane, τ = (mx, my, 0)/a is a vector of the
reciprocal plane lattice, kτ = kk + τ , and kzτ =

interpretable. We see that scattering gives diﬀracted waves. Some of them, eikτ rk−ikzτ z, go
back to the space z < 0, and they constitute reﬂected wave function ψr(r). The others,
, go forward to the space z > 0 and they constitute transmitted wave

0. The operator ˆkrr has eigen vectors

We see that diﬀraction by a single crystal can be reduced to reﬂection and transmission of a
one dimensional potential for a particle with an inﬁnitely dimensional spin.

3.2 Sketch of the dynamical diﬀraction theory

Let us imagine the single crystal as a one dimensional system of crystalline planes parallel to
the entrance surface and separated by distance a. We can consider it as a one dimensional
potential with symmetric period, consisting of a crystalline plane and two empty spaces of
width a/2 on both sides of it. Reﬂection ˆr and transmission ˆt amplitudes of so deﬁned one
period are easily obtained from ˆrs and ˆts of a single plane:

ˆr = ˆEˆrs ˆE,

ˆt = ˆEˆts ˆE = ˆE2 + ˆr,

(34)

where ˆE is a diagonal matrix with matrix elements
describes propagation of the state Ψ in empty space.

First, we can ﬁnd diﬀraction from a semiinﬁnite single crystal. We denote by ˆX the state
incident upon the second period of the crystal, and put down equations for ˆX and reﬂection
matrix ˆR:

(35)
which is similar to (13). We can resolve the ﬁrst equation with respect to ˆX and substitute in
the second one. As result, we obtain

ˆX = ˆt + ˆr ˆR ˆX,

ˆR = ˆr + ˆt ˆR ˆX,

ˆX = (I

ˆr ˆR)−1ˆt,

ˆR = ˆr + ˆt ˆR(I

ˆr ˆR)−1ˆt,

(36)

−

−

however, solution of this system is more complicated than of (13), because in general matrices
ˆr, ˆR, ˆX and ˆt do not commute.

Suppose we could ﬁnd the solution. Then we are able to ﬁnd diﬀraction on a single crystal
of ﬁnite thickness. We deﬁne reﬂection ˆRN and transmission ˆTN amplitudes of the crystal
with N periods, and put down the system of equations similar to (19): ˆX N = ˆTN + ˆRN ˆR ˆX N ,
ˆR = ˆRN + ˆTN ˆR ˆX N . We can resolve it with respect to ˆRN and ˆTN , then we obtain

ˆTN = (I

ˆR2) ˆX N [I

ˆR ˆX N ˆR ˆX N ]−1,

ˆRN = [ ˆR

ˆX N ˆR ˆX N ][I

ˆR ˆX N ˆR ˆX N ]−1.

In the case of Laue diﬀraction all the intensity goes through the crystal. It means that reﬂection
can be neglected, therefore ˆTN
ˆtN . In the case of Bragg diﬀraction all the intensity is
reﬂected back to the same space, from where the incident wave arrived, therefore ˆX N can be
neglected and ˆRN

ˆX N

ˆR.

The simplest case is Laue diﬀraction. To ﬁnd the wave function after the crystal we need

to ﬁnd eigen function Ψq and eigen values λq = exp(iqa) of the matrix ˆt: ˆtΨq = λqΨq.

For Bragg diﬀraction we need to know R. Let’s look at the eq. R = ˆr + ˆt ˆR(I

in (36). Because of the dyadic form of ˆr, we can ﬁnd that (1

Because of volume limitations we were not able to present the new dynamical diﬀraction
theory in full details. However we hope that from our sketch readers are able to understand
it. For an exercise we propose to them to answer the question: what will happen if Bragg and
Laue conditions are satisﬁed simultaneously?

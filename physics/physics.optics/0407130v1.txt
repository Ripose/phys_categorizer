Abstract

We study the eﬀective second-harmonic generation (SHG) susceptibility

in graded metallic ﬁlms by invoking the local ﬁeld eﬀects exactly, and further

numerically demonstrate that the graded metallic ﬁlms can serve as a novel

optical material for producing a broad structure in both the linear and SHG

response and an enhancement in the SHG signal.

There are much recent interest and practical need for nonlinear optical materials that

process large nonlinear susceptibility or optimal ﬁgure of merit [1]. A large enhancement

in nonlinear responses has been found for a sub-wavelength multilayer (i.e., thin ﬁlm) of

titanium dioxide and conjugated polymer [2]. For nonlinear eﬀects other than the Kerr

eﬀect [1], Hui et al. [3] derived general expressions for the eﬀective susceptibility for the

second-harmonic generation (SHG) in a binary composite of random dielectrics. They have

also studied the thickness dependence of eﬀective SHG susceptibility in ﬁlms of random

dielectrics and in composites with coated small particles [4,5].

Graded materials with various functionalities appear in nature and in fabricated materi-

als. Graded thin ﬁlms have many applications as the gradation proﬁle provides an additional

control on the physical properties. Graded thin ﬁlms often possess diﬀerent optical proper-

ties [6], when compared with bulk materials. It is known that graded materials have quite

diﬀerent physical properties from the homogeneous materials [7,8]. Also, it has been ob-

served that graded thin ﬁlms possess better dielectric properties than a single-layer ﬁlm [9].

However, how to achieve enhanced SHG is up to now a challenging agenda (see

Refs.[10,11] and references therein). For instance, recently one obtained enhanced SHG

by means of resonant waveguide gratings incorporating ionic self-assembled monolayer poly-

mer ﬁlms [11]. In this paper, we shall investigate SHG in a graded metallic ﬁlm with an

intrinsic SHG response and a graded linear response in the metallic dielectric function.

Let us consider a graded metallic ﬁlm with thickness L, with the gradation proﬁle in the

direction perpendicular to the ﬁlm. If we only include quadratic nonlinearities, the local

constitutive relation between the displacement ﬁeld D(z) and the electric ﬁeld E(z) in the

static case would be Di(z) =

j ǫij(z)Ej(z) +

jk χijk(z)Ej(z)Ek(z) [4,5] with i = x, y, z,

where Di(z) and Ei(z) are the ith component of D(z) and E(z), respectively, and χijk is

P

P

the SHG susceptibility. Here ǫij(z) denotes the linear dielectric function, which we assume

for simplicity to be isotropic ǫij(z) = ǫ(z)δij. Both ǫ(z) and χijk(z) are functions of z and

describe the gradation proﬁles.

In general, when a monochromatic external ﬁeld is applied, the nonlinearity will generate

2

local potentials and ﬁelds at all harmonic frequency. For a ﬁnite frequency external electric

ﬁeld of the form E0 = E0(ω)e−iωt +c.c., the eﬀective SHG susceptibility ¯χ2ω can be extracted

by considering the volume average of the displacement ﬁeld at the frequency 2ω in the

inhomogeneous medium [3–5].

In the present work, we adopt a graded dielectric proﬁle that follows the Drude form

ǫ(z, ω) = 1 −

ω2
p(z)
ω(ω + iγ(z))

,

(1)

where 0 ≤ z ≤ L. The general form in Eq. (1) allows for the possibility of a gradation

proﬁle in the plasma frequency [e.g., Eq. (4)] and the relaxation rate [e.g., Eq. (5)]. For a

z-dependent proﬁle, we can make use of the equivalent capacitance for capacitors in series

to evaluate the eﬀective perpendicular linear response for a given frequency, i.e., 1/¯ǫ(ω) =

(1/L)

L
0 dz[1/ǫ(z, ω)]. Using the continuity of the electrical displacement ﬁeld, the local

electric ﬁelds E(z, ω) satisﬁes

R

ǫ(z, ω)E(z, ω) = ¯ǫ(ω)E0(ω),

(2)

where E0(ω) is the applied ﬁeld along z axis.

A z-dependent proﬁle for the plasma frequency and the relaxation time can be achieved

experimentally. One possible way may be to impose a temperature proﬁle, as it has been

observed that surface enhanced Raman scattering is sensitive to temperature [12]. Thus,

one may tune the surface plasmon frequency by imposing an appropriate temperature gra-

dient [13]. A temperature gradient may also be used in materials with a small band gap

or with a proﬁle on dopant concentrations. In this case, one may impose a charge carrier

concentration proﬁle to a certain extent. This eﬀect, when coupled with materials with a

signiﬁcant intrinsic nonlinear susceptibility, will give us with a way to control the eﬀective

nonlinear response. For less conducting materials, one may replace the Drude form of di-

electric constants by a Lorentz oscillator form. It may also be possible to fabricate dirty

metal ﬁlms in which the degree of disorder varies in the z-direction and hence leads to a

relaxation-rate gradation proﬁle.

3

The calculation of the eﬀective nonlinear optical response then proceed by applying the

expressions derived in Refs.[3,4]. Next, the eﬀective SHG susceptibility ¯χ2ω is given by

¯χ2ω = hχ2ω(z)Elin(z, 2ω)Elin(z, ω)2i/[E0(2ω)E0(ω)2], where Elin is the linear local electric

ﬁeld in the graded ﬁlm with the same gradation proﬁle but with a vanishing nonlinear

response at the frequency concerned. Using Eq. (2) for the linear local ﬁelds, the eﬀective

SHG susceptibility can be rewritten as an integral over the ﬁlm as

¯χ2ω =

dzχ2ω(z)

To illustrate the SHG in graded ﬁlms, we consider as a model system that the intrinsic

SHG susceptibility χ2ω(z) = χ1 to be a real and positive frequency-independent constant and

does not have a gradation proﬁle. In doing so, we are allowed to focus on the enhancement

of the SHG response when compared with χ1. It should be noted that the present results

will not depend crucially on the particular form of the gradation proﬁle. The point is that

one needs a suﬃciently large gradient. To show the eﬀects of gradation, here we take as a

model plasma-frequency gradation proﬁle

and a model relaxation-rate gradation proﬁle [14]

ωp(z) = ωp(0)(1 − Cω · z),

γ(z) = γ(∞) + Cγ/z,

where Cω and Cγ are constant parameters tuning the proﬁle which is assumed to be linear in

z. Here γ(∞) denotes the bulk damping coeﬃcient, i.e., for z → ∞. Set thickness L = 1 so

that we could focus on the ﬁlm with a ﬁxed thickness. Regarding the thickness dependence,

we refer the reader to the work by Hui et al. [4]

Figure 1 shows the real and imaginary parts of the eﬀective linear dielectric constant

[Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b)], and the real and imaginary parts of the eﬀective SHG susceptibility

[Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 1(d)] as a function of frequency ω/ωp(0). Also shown is the modulus of

¯χ2ω/χ1, see Fig. 1(e). The dielectric function gradation proﬁle is given in Eqs. (1), (4) and (5)

with Cγ = 0, i.e., only a graded plasmon frequency is included. Throughout the calculations,

the real part of the (linear) dielectric constant is negative naturally. In this case, a broad

resonant plasmon band is observed. Note that for Cω → 0, ωp(z)/ωp(0) → 1. As Cω

increases, ωp(z) takes on values within a broader range across the ﬁlm, and leads to a broad

plasmon band. Increasing Cω also leads to a shift to the plasmon peak to lower frequencies.

The reason is that, in analogous to capacitors in series, the eﬀective dielectric constant of the

ﬁlm is dominated by the layer with the smallest dielectric constant. For the SHG response,

the frequency dependence is quite complicated. As Cω increases, it is noted that structures

in the SHG response also shifts to the lower frequencies and the range of values of the SHG

susceptibility increases as well.

Figure 2 displays the results of model calculations in which a gradation proﬁle of the

relaxation rate of the form in Eq. (5) is also included. The eﬀects are similar to those in

Fig. 1. The SHG response is found to be enhanced more strongly in the presence of both a

relaxation-rate gradation and a plasma-frequency gradation (see Fig. 1) than for plasmon-

frequency gradation alone, especially at low frequencies. As Cγ increases, the structures in

the linear and SHG response both show a shift to lower frequencies.

The point for achieving the present results is that one needs a suﬃciently large gradient

rather than a crucially particular form of the dielectric function or gradation proﬁles. Thus,

it is expected that an enhancement in SHG responses will also be found in compositionally

graded metal-dielectric composite ﬁlms in which the fraction of metal component varies

perpendicular to the ﬁlm. In the present work, due to the symmetry of the ﬁlm, we have

only enhancement for the polarization perpendicular to the ﬁlm (i.e., parallel to the direction

of the gradient). In this polarization, the tangential component of electric ﬁeld E vanishes

identically. Thus, the continuity of normal component of D [see Eq. (2)] gives rise to

the enhanced SHG. However, for the polarization parallel to the ﬁlm, i.e., the tangential

component does not vanish.

In this polarization, it is the continuity of the tangential

component of E that leads to no enhancement at all [2].

In summary, we have carried out model numerical calculations for the eﬀective SHG

5

susceptibility in a graded metallic ﬁlms, with linear gradation proﬁle possibly imposed on

the plasma frequency and the relaxation time. It is found that the presence of a gradation

proﬁle leads to a broader structure in both the linear and SHG response and an enhancement

in the SHG signal. Therefore, the graded metallic ﬁlms can serve as a novel optical material.

We have expressed the nonlinear optical absorption of a semiconductor in terms of its

linear spectrum. We determined that the two-photon absorption coefﬁcient in a strong DC-

electric ﬁeld of a direct gap semiconductor can be expressed as the product of a differential

operator times the convolution integral of the linear absorption without a DC-electric ﬁeld

and an Airy function. We have applied this formalism to calculate the two-photon absorption

coefﬁcient and nonlinear refraction for GaAs and ZnSe using their linear absorption and

have found excellent agreement with available experimental data.

A fundamental limitation in non-linear spectroscopy is the requirement for large peak laser

intensities because a coherent N-photon process (N ≥ 2) has a small cross section. With the

limited availability of continuous laser sources having broad bandwidths and good coherence,

nonlinear spectroscopy is challenging. In contrast linear absorption cross sections are much larger,

especially in semiconductors close to a critical point (Van Hove singularities). Therefore, it would

be ideal if the nonlinear properties, such as the two-photon absorption and nonlinear refraction of

a semiconductor, could be predicted from their linear spectrum, which is relatively straightforward

to obtain. In this Letter, we present a theoretical approach to predict the two-photon absorption

spectrum of a direct gap semiconductor based only on its linear absorption spectrum close to the

band-edge. The formalism developed here also gives information about the role of a DC-electric

ﬁeld on the nonlinear optical response of semiconductors. We have also applied the Kramers-

Kronig relation to calculate the nonlinear refraction and have obtained excellent agreement with

the available experimental data for GaAs and ZnSe direct-gap semiconductors. This theory could

be of great signiﬁcance towards identifying promising nonlinear optical materials for application

in diverse areas such as optical switching and optical limiting.

The effect of electric ﬁeld on the dielectric constant of solids has been extensively investigated

in the past [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The effect, known as the Franz-Keldysh (FK) effect [7, 8], has been

used as a tool in spectroscopy to modulate the energy gap and resolve details of the band structure

otherwise embedded in a broadband background [9, 10, 11, 12]. Recently, we reported the cal-

culation of the nonlinear absorption coefﬁcient in the presence of a very strong electric ﬁeld for

direct as well as indirect gap semiconductors and extended the formalism to the N-photon process

[13, 14]. At the heart of the calculation is the use of a modiﬁed Volkov wavefunction that includes

the effect of the electric ﬁeld in one direction (Airy Function), and uses the S-matrix to calculate

the N-photon transition rate in ﬁrst-order perturbation theory. We worked in the effective mass

approximation and assumed that the momentum matrix elements were independent of electron-

hole wave vector k. We also assumed that the optical ﬁeld only modiﬁed the ﬁnal energy of the

electron-hole pair. Finally, we considered an isotropic solid with a full valence band and an empty

conduction band. The resulting generalized N-photon absorption coefﬁcient in the presence of a

DC-electric ﬁeld was given by [13]:

theorem) and view the differential operator as the N-photon absorption operator. In the case of

Eq. 6 contains a very remarkable result: the two-photon absorption is given by a convolution

of the linear absorption. So if the spectrum of the linear absorption close to the band edge is

known/measured then Eq. 6 can be used to generate the nonlinear absorption spectrum of the

[17] along with Eq. 6 we get:

Recently, there have been reports on the development of a new technique to measure the nonlin-

ear absorption in a broad spectral range using Z-scan and a supercontinuum laser source [18, 19].

Using this technique, the spectral distribution of the two-photon absorption for ZnSe was mea-

sured. To test the above theory, we have calculated the two-photon absorption for GaAs and ZnSe

semiconductors using Eq. 6. First, as shown in Fig. 1(a), the absorption coefﬁcient for GaAs was

estimated using Eq. 5 and using α

b and Eg as ﬁtting parameters, with low temperature experi-
mental values taken from [20] (where the absorption edge is dominant). Table. I shows the values

′

used in our calculation and the results for the energy gap and α

b. From the above result we calcu-
lated the two-photon absorption and the nonlinear refraction and compared it to the experimentally

′

measured values [21, 22], as shown in Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 1(c). We have done a similar analysis

for ZnSe and the results for the linear absorption are shown in Fig. 2(a), with experimental data

taken from [23]. The two-photon absorption and nonlinear refraction are shown in Fig. 2(b) and

(c) respectively, with experimental values taken from [18]. In our calculations, we have used a

characteristic energy of the DC ﬁeld Eµ = 1/10 × Eg in order to minimize band bending and

4

allow comparison with the zero ﬁeld case (F = 0). The excellent agreement is indeed quite re-

markable, especially when considering that the experimental absorption data for ZnSe was taken

from known values of n and k at room temperature [23], and related to the absorption coefﬁcient

through α = ( ω

nOc)Im(ǫ), where ǫ = n2 + k2 + 2ink, is the complex dielectric function.
In conclusion, we have explored some of the mathematical structures of the N-photon absorp-

tion process in the presence of a very strong DC-ﬁeld. We have found that the nonlinear absorption

can be expressed as the product of an N-photon operator times the linear absorption coefﬁcient.

This is, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst time that nonlinear processes have been viewed as a conse-

quence of a single photon process rescaled to an energy gap given by Eg/N. We also found that

because of this relation, results such as the convolution theorem, and KK can be introduced nat-

urally. Finally, we applied this formalism to two well known semiconductors (GaAs and ZnSe)

and found excellent agreement with experimental measured trends. This approach can be of great

value in predicting nonlinear properties solely from measurements of linear properties.

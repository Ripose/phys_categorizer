Abstract

A catadioptric sensor induces a projection between a given object surface and an image
plane. The prescribed projection problem is the problem of ﬁnding a catadioptric sensor that
realizes a given projection. Here we present a functional that describes the image error induced
by a given mirror when compared with a given projection. This expression can be minimized to
ﬁnd solutions to the prescribed projection problem. We present an example of this approach, by
ﬁnding the optimum spherical mirror that serves as a passenger side mirror on a motor vehicle.

Introduction

A catadioptric sensor generally consists of a camera pointed at a convex mirror. Catadioptric
sensors of this type tend to have large ﬁelds of view, and hence their most common application
is panoramic imaging.

We will assume a simple model of the dioptric component, known as the pinhole model,
which realizes the perspective projection. A limiting case of perspective projection is the
orthographic projection, in which the rays that impinge upon the image plane are parallel.
Such systems can be thought of as very narrow ﬁeld perspective devices.

Almost all work on catadioptric sensor design refers to sensors employing rotationally sym-
metric mirrors, since these mirrors are the simplest to make and to mathematically model. The
design of such mirrors reduces to solving an ordinary diﬀerential equation.

The earliest example of a camera employing a mirror is due to A.S. Wolcott [15] and appears
in the 1840 patent “Method of taking Likenesses by Means of a Concave Reﬂector and Plates so
Prepared as that Luminous or other Rays with act Thereon.” Remarkably, this device, which
is designed for use with a daguerreotype plate, appears just a few years after the invention of
photography. Since this patent, an enormous number of catadioptric cameras and projection
devices have appeared, many of which are documented on the webpage [11], which is a historical
resource on catadioptric sensor design created by the author. The ﬁrst use of diﬀerential methods
for the design of a mirror shape in a catadioptric sensor appears in the 1945 patent of Benford
[2]. Other works that make use of diﬀerential methods include [3], [4], [1], [8], [12], [5] , [6],
[10],[7], [13]. Early applications to robotics include [16] and [17]. A heuristic approach to image
error is discussed in [14].

2 Statement of the Prescribed Projection Problem

In this section we state the prescribed projection problem, which is our fundamental problem
of interest. Suppose one is given a ﬁxed surface, S, in R3, which we will call the object
surface and a camera with image plane I, also ﬁxed in R3. A given mirrored surface M
induces a transformation TM from some subset of I to S by following a ray (determined by the
camera model) from a point q ∈ I until it intersects the mirror at a point r. The ray is then
reﬂected according to the usual law that the angle of incidence is equal the angle of reﬂection
and intersects S at a point s. We then deﬁne TM (q) = s .
The prescribed projection problem for systems containing a single mirror is:

Given G : I −→ S, ﬁnd M such that TM = G. If no such M exists, then ﬁnd M such that
TM is a good approximation to G.

We will refer to G(q) as the target point. If an exact solution to the problem exists, then there
are several ways to calculate it. Otherwise, there are numerous ways to formulate and solve the
approximation problem.

Notice that for a given M , with q, r and s as above, that the vector q−r

|s−r| is normal
to M at r. This suggests a method of constructing a vector ﬁeld W on R3 that will be normal
to the solution: for each r ∈ R3 lying on a ray that enters the camera, deﬁne

|q−r| + s−r

W(r) =

q(r) − r
|q(r) − r|

+

G(q(r)) − r
|G(q(r)) − r|

(1)

where q(r) is the projection of r to I along the ray. We refer to this construction as the vector
ﬁeld method. Thus our problem is solved if we ﬁnd a surface whose gradient is parallel to W.

Image Error and Projection Error

A disadvantage of some of previous approaches to the problem is that they do not directly
address the error in the image, i.e., the goal should be to minimize the distortion error in the
resulting image.

Given the notation that TM is the transformation induced from the image plane to the object

surface by the mirror M , then the goal is to ﬁnd a solution to the equations

TM (x) = G(x)

which is a system of partial diﬀerential equations that is generally inconsistent (an example of
such a system is equations 8 and 9). We then deﬁne the projection error induced by a mirror
M as

Pe(M ) =

1
Area(U )

U

Z

|TM (x) − G(x)|2dA,

where U is the domain in the image plane over which the surface M is a graph. For example,
in the approach to the blindspot problem described below, the projection error of a mirror
described as a graph x = f (y, z) over [−1, 1] × [1, 1] is

where the prescribed transformation G is [x0, y, z] 7→ [αy, −k, αz]. (Here we are not taking the
surface to be at inﬁnity.) For example, if α = 1 then the mirror x = y makes the projection
error functional 0.

The projection error compares the image formed by projecting the domain U from the image
plane to the object surface, whereas we are interested in the error formed by the projection from
the object plane to the image plane via M . Thus we deﬁne the image error as the quantity

Ie(M ) =

1
Area(V )

V
Z

|G−1(y) − T −1

M (y)|2dA,

(5)

where V is the image of U under TM . In this form it is not possible to directly minimize the
image error because computing T −1
M is intractable. While it is possible to compute the projection
for a generic M , it does not appear possible to compute T −1
M because the structure of the bundle
of rays from the object plane to M is unknown until M is given. Nevertheless, performing a
change of variables on the integral (5) by taking y = TM (x) gives

Ie =

| det(dTM (x))|dA

This functional is amenable to numerical minimization. One great advantage of this func-
tional is that any solution M derived by any one of the previous methods may be improved by
minimizing Ie with M as an initial condition.

4 An application to design

The main purpose of deriving an expression for the image error is so that it can be minimized over
some appropriate family of surfaces and hence provide an answer to the prescribed projection
problem.

In [9], the authors consider the equations for a sideview mirror. It is shown that the projection
TM induced by a surface x = f (y, z) viewed orthographically along the x-axis (the image plane
is x = x0) to the plane y = −k, k > 0 is

where

The desired projection, G is

[x0, y, z] → [αy, −k, αz]

Since TM and G are known, we may minimize the image error over some class of surfaces.
Ideally one would perform this minimization over a large space, such as polynomials, trigono-
metric functions, or spline functions. Here we answer the question ”What is the best spherical
sideview mirror ?”.

We consider a spherical mirror which goes through the origin and with a center in the plane

z = 0, which has the general form

f (y, z) = −a +

a2 − z2 − y2 + 2yb.

Thus the parameters that are free for minimization are a and b. For this problem, if the
required ﬁeld of view is 45 degrees (this determines α and assuming that the image plane is a
unit square of side length 2, the optimal result, (using a gradient descendent algorithm) is

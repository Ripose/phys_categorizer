We demonstrate the coupling of PbS quantum dot emission to photonic crystal cavities at room
temperature. The cavities are deﬁned in 33% Al, AlGaAs membranes on top of oxidized AlAs.
Quantum dots were dissolved in Poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA) and spun on top of the cavities.
Quantum dot emission is shown to map out the structure resonances, and may prove to be viable
sources for room temperature cavity coupled single photon generation for quantum information
processing applications. These results also indicate that such commercially available quantum dots
can be used for passive structure characterization. The deposition technique is versatile and allows
layers with diﬀerent dot densities and emission wavelengths to be re-deposited on the same chip.

Photonic crystal cavities are a very suitable medium for control and conﬁnement of light on scales on the order of
a cubic wavelength of light in the material. The small modal volumes and high quality factors for these cavities make
them strong candidates for eﬃcient single photon generation for quantum information processing [1, 2], low threshold
lasing [3], and nonlinear optics phenomena [4]. Our main motivation is the search for emitters that can be coupled to
photonic crystal (PC) cavities in order to satisfy the constraints on indistinguishability and eﬃciency of the photon
source for quantum information processing. Additional motivation is the characterization of the electromagnetic
properties of passive elements to be used in photonic circuits. To date, successful generation of single photons coupled
to PC microcavities has been demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures because the emitters of choice degrade with an
increase in temperature. The emission wavelengths of the emitters have to be compatible with typical semiconductor
materials used for microcavities [2]. Room temperature generation of single photons has been observed from single
molecules [5], nitrogen vacancy centers [6], and CdSe quantum dots [7], but collection eﬃciencies were reduced due
to lack of coupling to good cavities. These sources, with the exception of nitrogen vacancy centers, operate at visible
wavelengths and are therefore diﬃcult to combine with cavities made in high index semiconductor slabs. In contrast,
PbS quantum dots (and other colloidal quantum dots such as PbSe) can be made to cover a very broad wavelength
range. Furthermore, these dots can be easily deposited onto passive structures in a low index polymer and can be
used to map out the resonances of the structures. This method is much easier than transmission and reﬂectivity type
measurements on single cavities. Lastly, PbS quantum dots are successfully used as ﬂuorescent labels in biological
imaging applications. Cavity enhanced emission and collection eﬃciency from such dots could prove to be a valuable
technique for targeted signal ampliﬁcation of a target molecule bound to or in the vicinity of the resonant cavity.

Here, we report on the coupling of emission from PbS quantum dots to semiconductor photonic crystal cavities at
room temperature. Photonic crystal cavities were made in a 160 nm thick AlGaAs (33% Al) membrane on top of 500
nm of AlAs. The cavities were deﬁned in 3% 450 K molecular weight (KmW) PMMA with the Raith Electron Beam
Lithography system. The patterns were transferred from PMMA developed in 3:1 Methyl Isobutyl Ketone (MIBK)
to the membrane with an electron-cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma etch process. The Al rich substrate was then
oxidized at 420o C for 10 minutes in the presence of water vapor in order to create an index contrast of 3.4:1.8 between
membrane and substrate. A scanning electron micrograph of the sample structure is shown in Fig. 2. PbS quantum
dots emitting at 850 nm and 950 nm were obtained from Evident Technologies. The dots were dissolved together in
1% 75 KmW PMMA at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in toluene and spun onto the structures at 2 krpm, resulting in
20nm-100nm membrane (bulk spectra shown in Fig. 1). The coating was not uniform due to the small chip size
a
∼ (5mm2) and presence of structures on the chip surface. This concentration of emitters corresponds to ∼ 103 dots
per µm2. The dots were kept under vacuum, and excited with femtosecond pulses from a Ti:Saph laser at 760 nm.
Cavity spectra, collected under pulsed excitation, are shown in Fig. 3. The spectra reveal two orthogonally polarized
modes as expected for this type of photonic crystal cavity. The linearly increasing background observed on the spectra
can be explained by considering the emission proﬁle of the dots and the reﬂectivity of the PMMA/AlGaAs/AlOx
structure, which leads to an almost linear emission proﬁle of dots on the AlGaAs slab.

The cavity used is shown in Fig. 2. The coupling between a cavity and emitter depends on both the spatial
alignment and the orientation of the emitter dipole moment relative to the cavity ﬁeld. The chosen cavities support
two dipole type (electric ﬁeld primarily polarized in x and y) cavity modes with maxima in the central hole in (Fig.
2). The asymmetric cavity was modeled using Finite Diﬀerence Time Domain (FDTD) methods [1]. The simulations
predict the splitting between the two resonant peaks to be ≈ 43 nm, which is somewhat larger than the observed
splitting of 37.5 nm and is likely due to deviations of fabricated structures from simulated ones. The quality factor
(Q) is the ﬁgure of merit for these cavities, and can be written as

(1)

The above description separates the cavity losses into an out-of-plane loss which leads to directly observed emission,
and losses into the Bragg mirrors in the plane of the two dimensional crystal. The cavities investigated here have
experimentally observed x-dipole Q’s ≈ 400 and y-dipole Q’s ≈ 200. Simulations for the asymmetric cavity predict
that the out of plane Q⊥ ≈ 8000 for the x-dipole mode and ≈ 4000 for the y-dipole. The in-plane Q|| was only ≈ 450
and 400 for these modes, and thus limits the total Q. The center hole sidewalls are not vertical because of a reduced
etch rate for smaller features and a lower dose delivered to the PMMA due to proximity eﬀects. Since this hole is in
the region of maximal electric ﬁeld, imperfections will strongly reduce the quality factor. The two cavity modes are
shown in Fig. 2 b. In a perfectly symmetric cavity, where the two holes above and below the defect are unperturbed,
the x and y modes are degenerate. We shift the four holes in order to increase the Q factor for the x dipole mode, as
has been discussed in [1].

The photonic crystal can both enhance and reduce spontaneous emission (SE) rates for the quantum dots. The
enhancement is desirable for photon generation and spectroscopy applications due to increased signal rate and strength.
The ﬁgure of merit for this modiﬁcation is the Purcell factor F = ΓC
Γ0 . Here Γ is the emission rate in the cavity, and

3

Γ0 is that without the cavity. The observed spontaneous emission rate for an emitter with dipole moment ~µ at a point
on the cavity can be derived from Fermi’s Golden rule [8], and the total rate takes the form

Here ~E is the electric ﬁeld at the position of the emitter, Vmode is the cavity mode volume, ∆λ is the detuning from

to the presence of the photonic crystal lattice and modes other than the cavity mode. This modiﬁcation results in
a suppression of emission [2, 9]. The cavity mode volume can be quite accurately derived from FDTD calculations,
and with the cavity Q derived from the spectra, we calculate an FC ≈ 30. We can also derive an average value of
the suppression FP C from the experimental data. The total intensity collected by the spectrometer Iφ is given by the
emission rate 2, integrated over the spatial and spectral density of the emitters.

Here φ is the value of the polarizer angle, ηC is the collection eﬃciency due to the cavity radiation proﬁle, η0 is the
collection eﬃciency from an emitter embedded in the PMMA layer and uncoupled to the cavity, ρ(λ, ~r, ~µ) contains
the spectral and spatial distribution of the dots and the orientations of their dipole moments. The value of ηC can be
estimated from numerically integrating the PC emission proﬁle over the numerical aperture (NA) of the lens, and is
ηC ≈ 8%. The coupling eﬃciency of the bulk emitter is given by the integral over the sub-critical solid angle deﬁned

Using the value of FC and the x-dipole ﬁeld, the average value of FP C over the lattice around the cavity can thus
be estimated from the spectra. Assuming random dipole orientation, the integral over ~µ gives 1
3 . We take the spectral
distribution of the dots to be Gaussian and centered at 850 and 950 nm with a FWHM of 100 nm. The cavity
lineshape is Lorentzian with a FWHM of 2 nm. Only dots which are excited by the pump are contributing to the
intensity, and so the spatial density corresponds to the excitation of a uniform dot distribution by a Gaussian pulse
with a FWHM of 600nm in the x,y plane and uniform in z, since the layer is thin relative to the focal depth. The
integral over the ﬁeld is done numerically with the simulated cavity ﬁeld components. The spectral data shown in
Fig. 3 b. gives R ≈ 1.07. Using the value of FC = 30, FP C is estimated to be FP C ≈ 0.6, which qualitatively agrees
with the values found in [2, 9].

In conclusion, we have shown coupling of PbS quantum dots dissolved in PMMA to photonic crystal cavities at
room temperature. The dot emission maps out the cavity resonances and is enhanced relative to the bulk emission by
a maximal Purcell factor of 30. Using the emission spectra with and without cavity lines, we derive a photonic crystal
lattice spontaneous emission rate modiﬁcation of ≈ 0.6. To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst demonstration of coupling
of colloidal quantum dots to photonic crystal cavities, and the ﬁst use of such dots as a broadband on-chip source
for cavity characterization. The deposition technique presented in this work is easy to use and allows many diﬀerent
types of emitters to be deposited and re-deposited onto both passive and doped cavities. E-beam lithography can
further be used to remove doped PMMA from regions around the cavity, and increase the probability of receiving the
signal from a single emitter spatially aligned with the cavity ﬁeld maximum.

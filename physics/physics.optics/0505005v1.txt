ABSTRACT: We report on a strategy for achieving negative phase velocity (NPV) in a ho-

mogenized composite medium (HCM) conceptualized using the Bruggeman formalism. The

constituent material phases of the HCM do not support NPV propagation. The HCM and its

constituent phases are isotropic dielectric–magnetic mediums; the real parts of their permittivi-

ties/permeabilities are negative–valued whereas the real parts of their permeabilities/permittivities

Keywords: negative phase velocity, negative refraction, Bruggeman formalism

are positive–valued.

1. INTRODUCTION

A plane wave is said to propagate with negative phase velocity (NPV) if its phase velocity

is projected opposite to the time–averaged Poynting vector. A host of exotic electromagnetic

phenomenons follow as consequence of NPV, most notably negative refraction [1], as is well–

documented elsewhere [2, 3].

In the absence of readily available, naturally occurring materials which support NPV propa-
gation1, the realization of artiﬁcial metamaterials which are eﬀectively homogeneous and which

support NPV propagation has been the focus of considerable attention [3]. NPV metamaterials

for performance in the microwave regime have been realized [6]–[9], and progress towards the

same goal in the optical regime continues to be made.

The simplest medium which supports NPV propagation is the idealization represented by

the nondissipative isotropic dielectric–magnetic medium with relative permittivity ǫ < 0 and

relative permeability µ < 0. In reality, the eﬀects of dissipation necessitate that ǫ and µ are

complex–valued. In a dissipative isotropic dielectric–magnetic medium, NPV is indicated by

the satisfaction of the inequality [2, 10]

Re {ǫ}
Im {ǫ}

+

Re {µ}
Im {µ}

< 0 .

In this communication we address the question: can the NPV condition (1) be satisﬁed by a

homogenized composite medium (HCM) which arises from constituent material phases which

do not themselves support NPV propagation?

2. HOMOGENIZATION

Let us consider the homogenization of two constituent material phases: phase a and phase

b. Both material phases are taken to be isotropic dielectric–magnetic mediums with relative

permittivities ǫa,b and relative permeabilities µa,b. The relative permittivity and relative per-

meability of the HCM are written as ǫHCM and µHCM , respectively. In accordance with the

principle of causality and because of the implicit time–dependence exp(−iωt), we have

Im {ǫℓ} > 0

Im {µℓ} > 0

as the mediums under consideration are assumed to be passive. The volume fraction of phase

ℓ is denoted by fℓ ∈ (0, 1) (ℓ = a, b) with fa + fb = 1.

Conventional approaches to homogenization of particulate materials, such as provided by

We note the possibility of NPV induced by the eﬀects of (a) special relativity in simple dielectric–magnetic

mediums [4] and (b) general relativity in vacuum [5].

the Bruggeman and the Maxwell Garnett formalisms [11], run into diﬃculties within the con-

text of NPV–supporting HCMs. These formalisms have been shown to be inappropriate if

Re {ǫa} Re {ǫb} < 0 or Re {µa} Re {µb} < 0, at least in the weakly dissipative regime [12].

There are no such diﬃculties provided that Re {ǫa} Re {ǫb} > 0 and Re {µa} Re {µb} > 0.

However, in view of (2), it is clear that the NPV condition (1) cannot be satisﬁed if Re {ǫ} > 0

and Re {µ} > 0. We therefore explored the prospects of achieving NPV in a HCM arising from

components with either

Case I: Re {ǫa,b} < 0 and Re {µa,b} > 0, or

Case II: Re {ǫa,b} > 0 and Re {µa,b} < 0.

Cases I and II are duals of each other, and only one of the two needs further investigation.

The relative permittivity and relative permeability of the corresponding HCM are estimated

by the Bruggeman formalism as [13]

ǫHCM =

faǫa (ǫb + 2ǫHCM ) + fbǫb (ǫa + 2ǫHCM )
fa (ǫb + 2ǫHCM ) + fb (ǫa + 2ǫHCM )

µHCM =

faµa (µb + 2µHCM ) + fbµb (µa + 2µHCM )
fa (µb + 2µHCM ) + fb (µa + 2µHCM )

.






As a representative example, let

ǫa = −6 + 0.9i,

µa = 1.5 + 0.2i

ǫb = −1.5 + i,

µb = 2 + 1.2i

,

in accordance with Case I. The Bruggeman estimates ǫHCM and µHCM are plotted as functions

of the volume fraction fa in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. Whereas Re {ǫHCM } follows an

almost linear progression between its constraining values of Re {ǫb} at fa = 0 and Re {ǫa} at

fa = 1, and similar dependences are evinced by both Re {µHCM } and Im {µHCM }, Im {ǫHCM }

displays a markedly nonlinear relationship with respect to fa.

In Figure 3, the NPV parameter

is graphed against the volume fraction fa. For the constituent material phases we have the

constant values ρa = 0.83 and ρb = 0.17; i.e., neither constituent phase supports NPV propaga-

tion. In contrast, ρHCM is negative–valued for 0.28 < fa < 0.92. Thus, we see that the HCM

supports NPV propagation across a wide range of volume fractions.

3. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In answer to the question posed in Section 1: an HCM which supports NPV propagation,

arising from constituent material phases which do not support NPV propagation, may be con-

ceptualized through homogenizing components with Re {ǫa,b} < 0. In view of (1), it may be

inferred that the prospects for NPV propagation are increased through considering constituent

phases with relatively small Im {ǫa,b} and relatively large Im {µa,b}.

Since the relative permittivities and relative permeabilities are decoupled within the Brugge-

man formalism, our demonstration with Case I also holds for Case II. However, we note that

in practice suitable materials with Re {ǫa,b} < 0 may be more readily available than those with

Re {µa,b} < 0.

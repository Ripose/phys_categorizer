We report an injection-locked cw titanium:sapphire ring laser at 846 nm. It produces 1.00 W in a
single frequency when pumped with 5.5 W. Single frequency operation requires only a few milliwatts
of injected power.

Single frequency cw lasers are central to many exper-
iments in spectroscopy, atomic physics, nonlinear op-
tics, quantum optics, metrology, ranging, communica-
tions, and other ﬁelds. A number of tunable and ﬁxed-
frequency lasers are commercially available to cover the
near ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared spectral re-
gions. Dye lasers, Ti:sapphire lasers, optical paramet-
ric oscillators, Nd:YAG lasers, various gas lasers, diode
lasers, and many others regularly ﬁnd applications in
these ﬁelds.

A few years ago, high-power single frequency diode
lasers began to compete over selected wavelength ranges
with moderate power Ti:sapphire lasers and dye lasers
(see, for example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and many others). These
diode lasers were relatively inexpensive and could be
frequency-stabilized, either by injection locking or by an
external cavity, making them ideal for certain classes of
experiments. However, many of these high-power single
frequency diode lasers have become increasingly expen-
sive and diﬃcult to obtain at particular wavelengths.

In this paper we describe a moderate power, cw, tuna-
ble, single-frequency injection-locked Ti:sapphire laser.
Injection-locking a high power laser with a low-power
master laser reproduces the master laser at higher power
with good ﬁdelity [6, 7].
Injection-locking has been
demonstrated in a wide range of cw laser systems, includ-
ing Nd:YAG [8, 9, 10], argon-ion [11], He-Ne [12], diode
[13], and dye lasers [14]. It has also been demonstrated
for pulsed Ti:sapphire [15, 16] and dye lasers [17, 18].
However, it has apparently not been demonstrated in cw
Ti:sapphire lasers.

The injection laser determines the output wavelength
and forces both single frequency and uni-directional oper-
ation. It eliminates birefringent ﬁlters and optical diodes
in more traditional Ti:sapphire lasers [19, 20, 21, 22].
The wavelength tunability of our system mirrors the tun-
ability of the diode laser. While no single diode laser
covers the entire tuning range of Ti:sapphire, diodes are
available at many wavelengths from 0.66 to 1.1 µm. Fur-
thermore, many kinds of experiments use only a lim-
ited wavelength range—some using only several GHz of
tuning—and our laser is well-suited for those experi-
ments.

Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of our experiment.
The master laser is an extended-cavity diode laser at 846
nm [23], ampliﬁed in a single pass through a tapered
laser diode [24]. It is optically isolated and coupled into
a single-mode optical ﬁber. It delivers up to 30 mW to
the Ti:sapphire laser cavity.

A pair of lenses mode-matches the collimated output
from the ﬁber into the Ti:sapphire ring cavity. The cou-
pling eﬃciency is typically 75% into the TEM00 Gaussian
mode of the cavity, and higher order modes are about
1% or less than the Gaussian mode. The Ti:sapphire
cavity is a four-mirror folded (bowtie) cavity around a
Ti:sapphire crystal. The crystal is 10 mm long, 3 mm
diameter, Brewster cut, with a low-power single-pass ab-
sorption coeﬃcient of 2.1 at 532 nm. It is mounted in a
water-cooled brass housing. The cavity’s ﬂat output cou-
pler reﬂectivity is 96.6%. The reﬂectivities of the other
three mirrors are all > 99.5%. The radius of curvature
for the curved mirrors is 100 mm. The short distance be-
tween the two curved mirrors, including the path through
the crystal, is 114 mm. The long distance between the
two curved mirrors is 1020 mm. The angle of incidence
on the curved mirrors is 8
. These distances and angle of
incidence are chosen to compensate for the astigmatism
introduced by the Brewster-cut crystal [25]. The “cold-
cavity” ﬁnesse, measured without pumping the crystal,
is 110.

Up to 5.5 W from the 532 nm pump laser is focused
into the middle of the Ti:sapphire crystal. Not shown in
the Figure is a telescope in the green laser beam, with
one lens mounted on a micrometer stage, to optimize the
focus of the green laser beam into the crystal.

The diode current in the master laser is modulated at
37.15 MHz. This produces the frequency sidebands nec-
essary to lock the master laser to the Ti:sapphire cavity
using the Pound-Drever-Hall technique [26]. The elec-
tronic feedback circuit is a two-stage integrator, with
fast feedback to the master laser current, and slow feed-
back to the master laser cavity length. One of the
Ti:sapphire cavity mirrors is mounted on a piezo-electric
crystal, allowing approximately 8 GHz of continuous fre-
quency tuning. To achieve a particular wavelength from
the Ti:sapphire laser, it is necessary to ﬁrst set the ap-
proximate wavelength of the diode laser before injection-
locking the Ti:sapphire laser. Fine wavelength tuning is
achieved by scanning the Ti:sapphire cavity after engag-
ing the lock. The optical signal used for the feedback
circuit comes from a weak reﬂection from an uncoated
quartz optical ﬂat in the high power output from the
Ti:sapphire laser. This reﬂected beam is attenuated to
prevent saturation in the feedback photodiode. All of
the power measurements reported here are made after
the quartz ﬂat, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 2 shows a plot of the power out of the injection-
locked laser as a function of pump power. It also shows
the free-running laser output power, when the injection
laser is blocked. The injection-locked and free-running
lasers have essentially the same maximum power out-
put and slope eﬃciency. However, the injection-locked
laser has a signiﬁcantly lower threshold power. With-
out injection-locking, the laser does not oscillate until
photons are spontaneously emitted into the cavity mode.
However, the injection laser puts photons into the cavity
mode, and the laser oscillates at pump powers below the
non-injected threshold.

Our measured slope eﬃciency (23%) matches calcula-
tions based on a theoretical model [21]. However the
threshold power (about 1.2 W) is considerably higher
than the calculation (about 0.3 W). This implies that
either the cavity waist or the pump laser waist (or both)

are not as small as they should be. This is probably due
to thermal lensing and to a mismatch between the con-
focal parameter for the pump laser beam and the crystal
length.

When properly injected, the Ti:sapphire laser output is
a single frequency. We monitor the frequency spectrum of
the Ti:sapphire laser output with a scanning Fabry-Perot
cavity (free spectral range = 2 GHz, ﬁnesse = 400). The
optical spectrum of the injection laser beam is shown in
Figure 3 (top trace). Also shown is the optical spectrum
of the ampliﬁed beam (bottom trace). In both cases, the
measured spectral width of the laser reﬂects the limit of
resolution of the scanning Fabry-Perot cavity.

While the scanning Fabry-Perot does not have enough
resolution to measure the spectral width of the laser, it
can still give us an indication of the frequency content
of the beam. Taking the Fabry-Perot cavity out of its
sweeping-mode operation, we tune it into resonance with
the Ti:sapphire laser. The signal output from the Fabry-
Perot cavity is now a measure of the relative frequency
of the cavity and the laser. The power spectrum of this
measurement is shown in Figure 4. The upper trace in
the Figure compares the cavity to the injection laser. The
lower trace compares the cavity to the Ti:sapphire laser
at an output power near 1 W. The two traces are es-
sentially identical. They both fall rapidly in the ﬁrst
hundred Hz, more slowly to 5 kHz, and are ﬂat at higher
frequencies.

The minimum power required to maintain single fre-
quency operation apparently depends critically on the
feedback circuit. For our laser with a 1134 mm round
trip cavity length, the minimum power, Pmin, for diﬀer-
ent pump powers is shown in Table I. As the injection
power decreases, the amplitude noise in the output in-
creases (indicating an improper feedback gain) long be-
fore the frequency noise increases. We also made smaller
ampliﬁer cavity, with 50 mm radius of curvature mirrors
and an overall cavity length of 360 mm. The smaller

cavity, which has the same waist size, operates similarly
to the system described in this paper in both threshold
power and slope eﬃciency. However, the minimum power
required to maintain single frequency operation is lower
by a factor of 3.

We have demonstrated a single frequency cw injection-
locked Ti:sapphire laser at 846 nm, continuously tunable
over an 8 GHz range, with an output power of 1 W.
The wavelength tuning range is determined by the tun-
ing range of the laser diode used to inject the Ti:sapphire
laser. A broad range of laser diodes are available that
cover much of the Ti:sapphire gain region. At those
wavelengths, an injection-locked Ti:sapphire laser will
produce output powers in the 1 W range at relatively
low cost.

Abstract

We present a laterally emitting, coupled cavity micro ﬂuidic dye ring laser, suit-
able for integration into lab-on-a-chip micro systems. The micro-ﬂuidic laser has
been successfully designed, fabricated, characterized and modelled. The resonator
is formed by a micro-ﬂuidic channel bounded by two isosceles triangle mirrors. The
micro-ﬂuidic laser structure is deﬁned using photo lithography in 10 µm thick SU-8
polymer on a glass substrate. The micro ﬂuidic channel is sealed by a glass lid,
using PMMA adhesive bonding. The laser is characterized using the laser dye Rho-
damine 6G dissolved in ethanol or ethylene glycol as the active gain medium, which
is pumped through the micro-ﬂuidic channel and laser resonator. The dye laser
is optically pumped normal to the chip plane at 532 nm by a pulsed, frequency
doubled Nd:YAG laser and lasing is observed with a threshold pump pulse energy
ﬂux of around 55 µJ/mm2. The lasing is multi-mode, and the laser has switchable
output coupling into an integrated polymer planar waveguide. Tuning of the lasing
wavelength is feasible by changing the dye/solvent properties.

1 Introduction

Integrable lab-on-a-chip light sources are essential for on-chip spectral analy-
sis of chemical samples [1]. For these applications dye lasers are of particular
interest due to the possibility of tuning the wavelength in the visible range.
Micro-ﬂuidic dye lasers have recently been demonstrated by glass [2] and poly-
mer [3] micro-fabrication and tunability has also been reported [4]. Polymer-
based laterally emitting single-mode dye-lasers were reported recently [5]. The
latter implementation is advantageous due to the direct integrability with lab-
on-a-chip systems without additional hybridization steps [6].

In this paper we present a new type of polymer-based laterally emitting micro-
ﬂuidic dye laser utilizing coupled cavities. Lasing is achieved with a new cavity
design (see Fig. 1) relying on total internal reﬂection at the interface between
the polymer (SU-8 with refractive index n1 = 1.59) and the surrounding air at
an incidence angle of 45◦. Bleaching of the dye is avoided by a regenerating ﬂow
through the micro-ﬂuidic channel. In this way, the dye may also be dynamically
changed, enabling real-time tunability of the laser. Furthermore, the output
coupling is switchable.

In the following sections we describe the resonator structure, the fabrication,
and the optical characterization. We also address the cavity mode spacing by
a simple model and ﬁnally conclusions are given.

2 The resonator structure

The laser resonator, see Fig. 1, resembles a classical Fabry–Perot resonator.
A 100 µm wide 10 µm deep micro-ﬂuidic channel is bounded by two isosceles
triangle mirrors formed in SU-8, giving rise to the laterally emitting ring laser
cavity. This optical resonator relies on total internal reﬂection at the vertical
sidewalls (a), (b), and (c) of the triangles, see Fig. 1. The laser dye gain
medium is located in the micro-ﬂuidic channel passing through the cavity.

Out-coupling of the laser light is achieved by a second micro-ﬂuidic channel
ﬁlled with ethanol, thereby removing the total internal reﬂection at the side (d)
in the cavity. The out-coupled light is collected through an integrated planar
’output waveguide’ (also in Fig. 1). The output coupling is switchable by
alternating the content of the second ﬂuidic channel between ethanol and air.
A metal mask with a transparent window at the resonator serves to localize the
optical pumping light to the resonator and diminish unwanted ﬂuorescence.

3 Fabrication

The fabrication sequence is schematically shown in Fig. 2. The process consists
of two parts: Step 1-3 is a lift-oﬀ process to deposit the metal mask, 50 nm
Cr and 250 nm Au, on a glass substrate, and step 4-8 is the forming of the
micro-structures in SU-8, drilling, and bonding a glass lid on top.

In step 4 the micro ﬂuidic laser structure, the integrated waveguide, and the
micro-ﬂuidic channels (shown in Fig. 1) are deﬁned by UV lithography on
the substrate in a 10 µm thick layer of SU-8 photo resist [7]. Subsequent to
development (step 5), the substrate is placed on a 150◦C hotplate for 2 × 60 s

2

which has the eﬀect of healing the cracks in the SU-8 (step 6). After drilling
the holes for the ﬂuid inlets and outlets (step 7) the micro-ﬂuidic channels
are sealed in step 8 by bonding a glass lid on top by means of a 5 µm thick
PMMA ﬁlm [8]. The bonding is carried out at a temperature of 120◦C with a
bonding force of 2 kN on a 4 inch wafer pair with a duration of 10 minutes.

4 Optical characterization

The laser structure is characterized using the laser dye Rhodamine 6G dis-
solved in i) ethanol and ii) ethylene glycol as the active gain medium, which is
infused at 50 µL/h through the micro-ﬂuidic channel and laser resonator. The
dye laser is optically pumped normal to the chip plane through the window
(see Fig. 1) at 532 nm by a pulsed, frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser. The
repetition rate is 10 Hz and the pulses have a duration of 5 ns.

The upper panels in Figs. 3 and 4 show typical output spectra with the dye
dissolved in ethanol and ethylene glycol, respectively. The concentration is in
both cases 2 × 10−2 mol/L. By increasing the pump pulse energy we observe
an increase in the output intensity. The lower panels show the output power
(numerically integrated output intensity) versus the pump pulse energy ﬂux
and the observed change of slope in the curves around 55 µJ/mm2 is a clear
signature of the onset of lasing for both solvents.

As shown in Fig. 5, the change of solvent introduces an over-all shift of the
output spectra of approximately 2 nm. The red shift of the spectra measured
using the ethylene glycol solution may be explained by a lower cavity-loss or
a higher dye quantum eﬃciency using this solvent [9]. Since the dye/solvent
properties can be changed dynamically this enables real-time tuning of the
central lasing wavelength [4].

The output coupling from the structure is switched on by ﬁlling the second
ﬂuid channel (see Fig. 1) with ethanol, and it is switched oﬀ again by blowing
air into the second channel or providing an under-pressure with a syringe,
thereby sucking air through the second channel.

5 The cavity modes

The cavity mode spectrum has been modelled by a scattering matrix approach
and Fig. 6 illustrates the ’unfolded’ structure. Formally, the scattering matrix
of the ’unfolded’ structure is calculated and periodic boundary conditions are
applied. In other words the ring resonator is formed by ’joining’ the two ends

3

of the unfolded structure. This allows for calculation of the spectral position of
the cavity modes. For the experimentally relevant parameters a mode spacing
of approximately 0.13 nm is found.

Comparing to the experimental output spectra in Figs. 3 and 4 we might
speculate that the sub-nanometer modulation of the overall peak resembles
the longitudinal mode spacing. However, since the spectrometer resolution is
around 0.15 nm the mode-spacing is not resolved experimentally. Compared to
the estimated mode-spacing the over-all width of the output spectra suggests
that the lasing is longitudinally multi-mode.

6 Conclusion

We have demonstrated a laterally emitting coupled cavity micro-ﬂuidic dye
ring laser. The laser is fabricated with polymer technology using a total-
internal reﬂection based cavity formed by two triangle mirrors. The light-
source is straight forward to integrate with polymer planar waveguides for
use in lab-on-a-chip devices. The dependence of the lasing wavelength on the
dye solution may enable tunability. Using a simple modelling approach we
estimated the mode-spacing of the order 0.13 nm which however can not be
fully veriﬁed experimentally due to limited spectrometer resolution. We have
shown the possibility of switching the output coupling which can be highly
useful also in other applications.

We measured and calculated transmission spectra of two-dimensional quasiperiodic photonic crys-
tals (PCs) based on a 5-fold (Penrose) or 8-fold (octagonal) symmetric quasiperiodic pattern. The
photonic crystal consisted of dielectric cylindrical rods in air placed normal to the basal plane on
vertices of tiles composing the quasiperiodic pattern. An isotropic photonic band gap (PBG) ap-
peared in the TM mode, where electric ﬁelds were parallel to the rods, even when the real part of a
dielectric constant of the rod was as small as 2.4. An isotropic PBG-like dip was seen in tiny Penrose
and octagonal PCs with only 6 and 9 rods, respectively. These results indicate that local multiple
light scattering within the tiny PC plays an important role in the PBG formation. Besides the
isotropic PBG, we found dips depending on the incident angle of the light. This is the ﬁrst report
of anisotropic structures clearly observed in transmission spectra of quasiperiodic PCs. Based on
rod-number and rod-arrangement dependence, it is thought that the shapes and positions of the
anisotropic dips are determined by global multiple light scattering covering the whole system. In
contrast to the isotropic PBG due to local light scattering, we could not ﬁnd any PBGs due to
global light scattering even though we studied transmission spectra of a huge Penrose PC with 466
rods.

INTRODUCTION

Photonic crystals (PCs) have attracted much attention
because they are interesting objects of study in physics
and because of their potential applications to various op-
tical devices such as micro optical circuits and single-
mode light-emitting diodes.[1] In a PC, a dielectric con-
stant is modulated periodically, and band structures of
light are therefore formed. This results in the appear-
ance of energy ranges called photonic band gaps (PBGs)
in which propagation of the light is forbidden. A PBG
common to all incident angles of light is called a complete
PBG.

It is also interesting to study optical properties of
quasiperiodic photonic crystals based on quasiperiodic
lattices. One-dimensional quasiperiodic PCs have al-
ready been investigated theoretically and experimentally.
PBGs have been observed in optical multilayers stacked
according to a Fibonacci sequence when an incident light
was normal to the layers.[2, 3, 4, 5] It has also been
found that the transmission coeﬃcient T is multifrac-
tal and that there is a scaling of the transmission coeﬃ-
cient with increase in Fibonacci sequences at a quarter-
wavelength optical thickness when the resonance condi-
tion is satisﬁed. Optical reﬂectivity spectra have been
calculated in quasiperiodic multilayers ordered accord-
ing to the Fibonacci or generalized Fibonacci sequence

when the thickness of each layer was much smaller than
the wavelength.[6] Frequencies at which spiky singular-
ities appear in the spectrum exhibit a self-similar and
nested structure.

Recently, two-dimensional quasiperiodic PCs have also
been investigated. The quasiperiodic PC consists of rods
placed perpendicular to the basal plane on vertices of
tiles composing a quasiperiodic pattern. Complete PBGs
have been observed in 5-fold (Penrose pattern),[7] 8-
fold (octagonal pattern),[8, 9, 10] 10-fold,[11] and 12-
fold[11, 12, 13] symmetric quasiperiodic PCs. An impor-
tant feature is that the position and width of the PBG
are almost independent of the incident angle of the light.
This is in contrast to the fact that PBGs are usually
anisotropic in periodic PCs. Complete PBGs have also
been seen in density of states (DOS) of photons even in
a small octagonal PC with only 33 rods.[8] Thus, it is
thought that the existence of complete PBGs depends
on the short-range arrangement of rods.

At present, the following unsolved problems remain.
The minimum size of a small quasiperiodic PC with a
PBG or related structure (a PBG-like dip, as will be
shown later) and the degree of anisotropy in the PBG
or related structure in a small PC have not been deter-
mined in previous studies. Since the PBGs in the octag-
onal PC with 33 rods were conﬁrmed by DOS, the degree
of anisotropy in the PBGs was not investigated. Inﬂu-
ence of long-range arrangement of rods on transmission
spectra has also not been studied. In periodic PCs, it is
thought that PBGs are established by long-range lattice
periodicity. On the other hand, the existence of a PBG

formed by long-range arrangement of rods has not been
found in a quasiperiodic PC. We therefore studied trans-
mission spectra at various incident angles in 5-fold and
8-fold symmetric quasiperiodic PCs with various num-
bers of rods.

II. METHODS OF EXPERIMENTS AND
CALCULATION

The two-dimensional quasiperiodic PC used in our
study consisted of dielectric cylindrical rods in air stand-
ing normal to the basal plane on vertices of tiles (rhombi
or squares) in a 5-fold (Penrose) or 8-fold (octagonal)
symmetric quasiperiodic pattern. Figure 1 schematically
shows rod arrangements of quasiperiodic PCs used in the
calculation. The circles represent the rods. Rods whose y
coordinates are the same are deﬁned as belonging to the
same layer. The numbers of layers and rods in each PC
are stated in the legend of Fig. 1. The incident direction
of the light is parallel to the basal plane. An incident
angle θ is deﬁned in Fig. 1. In the octagonal PC, besides
the 8-fold symmetry, the distribution of rods has mirror
symmetry with respect to a line of 22.5 degrees in each
45-degree sector. Therefore, the transmission coeﬃcient
T (θ) satisﬁes the relation T (θ) = T (45 − θ). In the Pen-
rose PC, besides the 5-fold symmetry, the distribution of
rods has mirror symmetry with respect to a line of 36
In addition, any PC
degrees in each 72-degree sector.
with many rods satisﬁes the relation T (θ) = T (180 + θ).
Thus, the relation T (θ) = T (36 − θ) exists. It is therefore
suﬃcient to investigate T (θ) in the range of 0 ≤ θ ≤ 22.5
and 0 ≤ θ ≤ 18 degrees for octagonal and Penrose PCs,
respectively. Two polarization conditions were used in
this study: electric ﬁelds being parallel to the rods (TM
mode) and electric ﬁelds being perpendicular to the rods
(TE mode).

the

The method used for

experiments was as
follows.[14] To fabricate the PC, a Cu mold was ﬁrst
made by the following procedure. Focused laser light was
irradiated on the surface of a 1-mm-thick Cu sheet, and
holes were drilled at room temperature in air. We utilized
the 2nd harmonics of Nd: YAG laser light (wavelength,
532 nm). Energy per pulse, pulsewidth, and repetition
rate were 0.7 mJ, 12 to 14 ns, and 300 Hz, respectively.
Each hole was drilled by 999 pulses of the laser light. The
holes were arranged on the vertices of tiles in a quasiperi-
odic pattern. After the Cu mold had been placed in a
small vessel, uncured polymer (epoxy resin) was poured
into the vessel and the holes were ﬁlled with the epoxy
resin. The epoxy resin was then cured thermally in air.
Subsequently, the cured epoxy resin together with the
Cu mold was detached from the vessel, and only the Cu
mold was dissolved in nitric acid, resulting in the forma-
tion of an array of epoxy-resin rods, i.e., a PC. Each rod
of the PC had a radius r of 22 µm and a length of 500
µm. The real part of the dielectric constant of the epoxy
resin Re(ǫ) was 2.4 at 40 to 200 cm−1.

2

Far-infrared transmission spectra were obtained at
room temperature using a Fourier transform spectrom-
eter (Bruker IFS 113v). A mercury lamp and a 6- or
23-µm-thick Mylar ﬁlm were utilized as a light source
and a beamsplitter, respectively. A polarizer made of
polyethylene with ﬁne grids was placed in front of the
PC in sequence from the light source to a detector. A
slit was placed just before the PC so that the light would
irradiate only on the PC. Two types of bolometers, both
of which were operated at 1.7 K, were used as detectors:
one was a Si-composite bolometer covering a spectral re-
gion between 20 and 60 cm−1, and the other was a Si
bolometer covering a spectral region between 40 and 700
cm−1. The resolution of the measurement was 2 cm−1.
An optical path was evacuated to avoid absorption due
to water vapor.

In the numerical calculation, it was assumed that a
plane electromagnetic wave was incident upon the sys-
tem. The Maxwell equation was solved by expanding
the electromagnetic ﬁeld in terms of vector cylindri-
cal harmonics.[15, 16] Expansion coeﬃcients were deter-
mined from the boundary condition at the surface of each
rod by applying the vector addition theorem to the scat-
tered ﬁelds from other rods. They were used to calculate
the distribution of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and Poynt-
ing vector. Then the average of the absolute value of
the Poynting vector was calculated on the sampling lines
shown in Fig. 1. The value obtained was normalized
by that of the incident plane wave so that it could be
regarded as a transmission coeﬃcient. Due to the ﬁ-
nite sample size, there was additional diﬀraction of light,
which would give the calculated transmission coeﬃcient
more than unity in some cases. Details of the calculation
method will be described in the subsequent paper.

III.

ISOTROPIC PHOTONIC BAND GAP

An isotropic PBG will be described in this section.
Figure 2 shows experimental and calculated transmis-
sion spectra in the TM mode of the Penrose PCs with
Re(ǫ) = 2.4. The radius of the rod is r = 22 µm,
and a tile side length is a = 85 µm. The PC used in
the experiment had 31 layers and 724 rods, while that
used in the calculation had 33 layers and 186 rods as
shown schematically in Fig. 1(a). To obtain suﬃcient
intensity of transmitted light, the PC used in the exper-
iment was longer in the x direction than that used in
the calculation. The experimental and calculated spec-
tra in the ﬁgures have been shifted vertically at intervals
of about 0.1 and 1, respectively, so they can be clearly
seen. Similar vertical shifts were performed for other
spectra presented in this paper. Each experimental spec-
trum in Fig. 2(a) exhibits a dip around ka/2π ∼ 0.54,
where k is a wave number of light in vacuum. This is
in agreement with the calculated spectra in Fig. 2(b),
where T is nearly 0 around ka/2π ∼ 0.54 as indicated
by the arrow. The spatial distribution of energy densi-

ties of electromagnetic ﬁelds was also calculated. The
energy density inside the PC around ka/2π ∼ 0.54 is
very small, indicating the existence of a PBG. The posi-
tion and width of the PBG are almost independent of the
incident angle, as has been reported for isotropic PBGs
in other quasiperiodic PCs.[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] Fine
structures are observed in the calculated spectra, while
they are smeared out in the experimental spectra. The
absence of ﬁne structures in the experimental spectra is
thought to be due to absorption of light inside the rods.
An isotropic and therefore complete PBG also exists
in the octagonal PC. Figure 3 shows experimental and
calculated transmission spectra in the TM mode of the
octagonal PCs with Re(ǫ) = 2.4, r = 22 µm, and a = 69
µm. The PC used in the experiment had 17 layers and
873 rods, while that used in the calculation had 19 layers
and 173 rods as shown schematically in Fig. 1(b). A dip
is seen in the experimental spectra at ka/2π ∼ 0.50 and
is in agreement with the calculated spectra, where T is
almost 0 in the same ka/2π as indicated by the arrow.
As will be shown later, no PBG was observed in the TE
mode of the abovementioned Penrose and octagonal PCs.
In quasiperiodic PCs as well as periodic PCs, a large
ratio of dielectric constants between rods and a surround-
ing medium is advantageous for PBG formation. In most
studies on quasiperiodic PCs, the ratio was larger than
8.9.[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13] Exceptions are the results of 12-
fold symmetric quasiperiodic PCs, which have complete
PBGs even when the ratio is 2.1.[12, 13] Our study has
shown that complete PBGs exist in Penrose and octag-
onal PCs with a small ratio of dielectric constants (2.4),
suggesting that any quasiperiodic PC can have a PBG in
optimum choice of r/a even when the ratio is as small as
2.4.

In order to determine the origin of an isotropic PBG,
we calculated transmission spectra of tiny PCs with small
numbers of rods. Figure 4 shows transmission spec-
tra calculated in the TM mode of Penrose PCs with
Re(ǫ) = 3.7, r = 22 µm, and a = 85 µm. The PC shown
in Fig. 4(a) has 33 layers and 186 rods, while that in Fig.
4(b) has only 6 rods as shown in Fig. 1(c). In this inves-
tigation, we chose Re(ǫ) = 3.7, because the PBG can be
seen more clearly at 3.7 than at 2.4. In the calculation of
transmission spectra at various incident angles, we usu-
ally ﬁxed the sampling line. In the case of a 6-rod Pen-
rose PC, on the other hand, the sampling line was rotated
around the origin in order for the incident light to be nor-
mal to the sampling line. This is because a transmission
spectrum is strongly aﬀected by the angle between the
sampling line and the light direction in such a tiny PC.
In the 186-rod Penrose PC, a complete isotropic PBG
exists at ka/2π = 0.45 ∼ 0.50. In the 6-rod Penrose PC,
there is a deep PBG-like dip almost in the same energy
range as that of the PBG. In addition, the position and
width of the PBG-like dip are almost independent of the
incident angle. Similarly, a tiny octagonal PC with only 9
rods (a central rod and 8 nearest-neighbor rods) exhibits
an isotropic PBG-like dip (not shown here). According

3

to Conway’s theorem, any local pattern of diameter D,
e.g., a 6-rod Penrose PC, repeats within a distance less
than a few D’s from the original pattern.[17] As a result,
large Penrose and octagonal PCs contain many 6-rod and
9-rod PCs, respectively. It is therefore thought that local
multiple light scattering within a tiny PC, which causes
a PBG-like dip, plays an important role in the PBG for-
mation and that the isotropy of the PBG stems from the
isotropy of the PBG-like dip. Of course, global multiple
light scattering covering a larger region than that of a
tiny PC aﬀects PBG formation to some extent, because
the PBG-like dip in the tiny PC has ﬁnite T and a larger
width than that of the PBG, indicating that only the lo-
cal light scattering within the tiny PC is not suﬃcient
for complete development of a PBG.

In periodic PCs, it is thought that PBGs are estab-
lished by long-range lattice periodicity. Accordingly, the
origin of an isotropic PBG in a quasiperiodic PC is diﬀer-
ent from the origin of a PBG in a periodic PC. However,
Jin et al. have recently shown the existence of PBGs in
two-dimensional amorphous photonic materials which do
not possess any long-range order but have short-range
order.[18] A PBG in an amorphous photonic material
overlaps the ﬁrst PBG of a corresponding square-lattice
PC. Thus, Jin et al. suggested that only short-range or-
der of the square-lattice PC is necessary for formation of
the ﬁrst PBG. This is similar to the mechanism of PBG
formation in quasiperiodic PCs. Further detailed investi-
gation of the relationship between corresponding dips in
a local structure and PBGs in a whole system for periodic
PCs as well as quasiperiodic PCs is needed.

Very recently, Miyazaki and Segawa have studied the
scattering of plane-wave electromagnetic ﬁelds in arrays
consisting of dielectric cylindrical rods with various rota-
tional symmetries.[19] A PBG was observed in the TM
mode and was almost independent of the incident direc-
tion of the light. This PBG is probably related to the
isotropic PBG in a two-dimensional quasiperiodic PC.

IV. ANISOTROPIC STRUCTURES IN
TRANSMISSION SPECTRA

Any anisotropic structures in transmission spectra of
quasiperiodic PCs have not been reported in previous
Since anisotropic structures in transmission
studies.
spectra have been found in our study, they will be de-
scribed in this section. Figure 5 shows experimental and
calculated transmission spectra in the TE mode of the
same Penrose PCs as those, for which spectra are shown
in Fig. 2. In contrast to the TM mode, no PBG is ob-
served up to ka/2π = 1.7. Instead, one or two dips at
ka/2π = 0.50 ∼ 0.60 and one dip at ka/2π ∼ 0.95 can
be seen in each experimental spectrum. The positions of
these dips depend weakly but clearly on the incident an-
gle. We call these dips weakly anisotropic dips. In each
calculated spectrum, the dips at ka/2π = 0.50 ∼ 0.60
are reproduced, and there are dips at ka/2π ∼ 1.0,

which probably correspond to the experimental dip at
ka/2π ∼ 0.95.

Similar results were obtained for the octagonal PCs.
Figure 6 shows experimental and calculated transmission
spectra in the TE mode of the same octagonal PCs as
those for which spectra are shown in Fig. 3. No PBG is
seen up to ka/2π = 1.4. There is a dip at ka/2π ∼ 0.50
both in the experimental and calculated spectra, and its
position shifts to higher energy with increase in angle.

Figure 7 shows experimental transmission spectra in
the TM mode of Penrose and octagonal PCs with Re(ǫ) =
2.4 and r = 22 µm. The Penrose and octagonal PCs had
a = 110 and 100 µm, 31 and 17 layers, and 562 and 607
rods, respectively. There is a dip around ka/2π ∼ 0.60 in
each spectrum of the Penrose and octagonal PCs. From
calculated spectra (not shown), it is understood that this
dip corresponds to an isotropic PBG. In addition to the
PBG, there are dips seen only at speciﬁc angles, i.e.,
strongly anisotropic dips. For example, in the Penrose
PC, a dip around ka/2π ∼ 0.90 at 0 degrees and dips
around ka/2π ∼ 0.75 and 1.15 at 18 degrees are not seen
at any angle. Similarly, in the octagonal PC, a dip around
ka/2π ∼ 0.75 at 0 degrees and dips around ka/2π ∼ 0.70
and 0.95 at 5.6 to 11.3 degrees are not observed at any
angle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
study showing the apparent existence of anisotropy in
transmission spectra.

The transmission spectra of PCs with various numbers
of rods were calculated. Figure 8 shows calculated trans-
mission spectra at 0 degrees of ﬁve Penrose PCs with
Re(ǫ) = 3.7, r = 22 µm, and a = 85 µm. The num-
bers of rods in the PCs were 6, 16, 31, 186, and 466.
The PCs with 6, 16, and 31 rods are shown in Fig. 1(c).
The PCs with 186 and 466 rods have 33 and 70 layers,
respectively, and both of these are shown in Fig. 1(a).
Figure 8(a) shows transmission spectra in the TE mode.
In the spectrum of the 186-rod PC, there are two dips
around ka/2π = 0.45 and 0.55. These dips correspond
to the two dips at ka/2π = 0.50 ∼ 0.60 in the 186-rod
PC with Re(ǫ) = 2.4 in Fig. 5, and show similar weak
angle dependence. The lower dip around ka/2π = 0.45
does not exist in the 6-rod and 16-rod PCs but appears
in the 31-rod PC. The higher dip around ka/2π = 0.55
does not exist in the 6-rod PC but appears in the 16-rod
PC. The transmission coeﬃcient in both dips decreases
with increase in rod number and is very small in the 466-
rod PC. Figure 8(b) shows transmission spectra in the
TM mode. There is a dip at ka/2π ∼ 0.25 indicated by
the arrow in the 186-rod Penrose PC. As is seen in Fig.
4(a), the dip is not observed at an angle greater than 9.7
degrees. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the dip does not exist in
the 6-rod and 16-rod PCs but appears in the 31-rod PC.
The transmission coeﬃcient in the dip decreases with in-
crease in rod number and is small in the 466-rod PC.
As a result, both weakly and strongly anisotropic dips
become evident as the rod number increases. It should
be emphasized that anisotropic dips are not seen in the
6-rod PC, in contrast to the fact that a deep PBG-like

4

dip appears even in the 6-rod PC.

As can be seen in Fig. 8(a), transmission coeﬃcient
is very small in the two dips around ka/2π = 0.45 and
0.55 in the 466-rod PC. Nevertheless, these dips are not
thought to be PBGs. A minimum of T in the dips is an
order of 10−2 and is much larger than a minimum of T
in the TM-mode PBG in the 466-rod PC, an order of
10−6. The energy densities of the electromagnetic ﬁelds
were also calculated. The ratio of minimum density in
the dips to density around a dip edge is about 10−2 in
the TE mode and the ratio of minimum density in the
PBG to density around a PBG edge is about 10−5 in
the TM mode. Until now, we have not been able to ﬁnd
PBGs other than the isotropic PBGs appearing already
in small PCs.

Figure 9 shows calculated transmission spectra at 0 de-
grees in the TM mode of two Penrose PCs with Re(ǫ) =
3.7, r = 22 µm, and a = 85 µm. The lower and up-
per spectra are spectra of the 186-rod PC (33 layers) in
Fig. 1(a) and the 187-rod PC (34 layers) in Fig. 1(d),
respectively. The lower spectrum and the spectrum of
the 186-rod PC in Fig. 8(b) are the same. These PCs
correspond to two diﬀerent regions inside a colossal Pen-
rose PC with 3946 rods. The strongly anisotropic dip at
ka/2π ∼ 0.25 in the lower spectrum does not exist at
the same energy in the upper spectrum. Therefore, the
appearance of anisotropic dips depends on positions of
PCs inside the colossal Penrose PC. On the other hand,
there are isotropic PBGs at ka/2π = 0.45 ∼ 0.50 in both
spectra. Since the formation of a PBG is mainly due to
local light scattering, there is no diﬀerence between the
PBGs in the two PCs.

It is thought that the anisotropic dips are determined
by global multiple light scattering covering the whole sys-
tem, because the dips strongly depend on the rod num-
ber and rod arrangement. This is in contrast to the fact
that local light scattering plays an important role in the
formation of an isotropic PBG. We have not been able
to ﬁnd any PBGs formed by global light scattering even
though we investigated the transmission spectra of a huge
Penrose PC with 466 rods. This is diﬀerent from the case
of periodic PCs in which the PBG shows its almost com-
plete shape in a system with a ﬁnite rod number.
In
periodic PCs, lattice periodicity is a very important fac-
tor for the existence of a PBG formed by a Bragg-like
multiple scattering mechanism. If the periodicity is de-
stroyed, then coherence in backscattered waves will be
destroyed and so will the PBGs.[20] Since quasiperiodic
PCs have no lattice periodicity, it is thought that PBGs
are not formed by global light scattering.

We can say that formation of PBGs is easy and dif-
ﬁcult in quasiperiodic PCs. An isotropic PBG can be
formed in a quasiperiodic PC with only a small num-
ber of rods. As for the dielectric constant, PBGs can
be formed in both periodic and quasiperiodic PCs even
when the ratio of dielectric constants between rods and
the surrounding medium is small. However, formation of
complete PBGs in periodic PCs is not so easy because of

anisotropy. On the other hand, a PBG in a quasiperiodic
PC is isotropic, and a complete PBG can therefore exist
even when the ratio of dielectric constants is small. On
the other hand, as stated above, formation of PBGs by
global light scattering is diﬃcult.

V. SUMMARY

We measured and calculated transmission spectra of
two-dimensional quasiperiodic photonic crystals (PCs)
based on a 5-fold (Penrose) or 8-fold (octagonal) symmet-
ric quasiperiodic pattern. A photonic crystal consisted of
dielectric cylindrical rods in air standing normal to the
basal plane on vertices of the tiles (rhombi and squares)
composing a quasiperiodic pattern. A complete isotropic
photonic band gap (PBG) appears in the TM mode even
when the dielectric constant of the rod is as small as 2.4.
An isotropic PBG-like dip was observed in tiny Penrose
and octagonal PCs with only 6 and 9 rods, respectively.
It is therefore thought that local multiple light scatter-
ing within the tiny PC, which causes the formation of
a PBG-like dip, plays an important role in PBG forma-
tion.
In addition to the isotropic PBG, we found dips
depending on the incident angle of light. This is the ﬁrst

5

study on anisotropic structures in transmission spectra
of quasiperiodic PCs. Based on the rod-number and rod-
arrangement dependence, it is thought that the shapes
and positions of the anisotropic dips are determined by
global multiple light scattering covering the whole sys-
tem. We have not been able to ﬁnd any PBGs formed
by global light scattering even though we investigated
the transmission spectra of a huge Penrose PC with 466
rods. This is diﬀerent from the results for periodic PCs
in which the PBG shows its almost complete shape in a
system with a ﬁnite rod number.

FIG. 1:
Schematic rod arrangements in two-dimensional
quasiperiodic PCs. Rod positions denoted by circles are the
vertices of tiles composing a quasiperiodic pattern. 5-fold or
8-fold perfect rotational symmetry exists only around the cen-
ter indicated by the double circle in the Penrose or octagonal
pattern. The origin of the xy coordinates is deﬁned to be
the center. The incident angle of light is deﬁned by θ. (a) A
186-rod Penrose PC (33 layers) is represented by a group of
double and open circles, and a 466-rod Penrose PC (70 lay-
ers) is represented by all of the circles. The side length a of
the rhombi is 85 µm. The longer and shorter bars parallel to
the x axis are the sampling lines of the Poyinting vector for
186-rod and 466-rod Penrose PCs, respectively. Their centers
are on the y axis at y = −446.57 µm and -838.13 µm, and
their lengths are 170 and 85 µm, respectively. (b) A 173-rod
octagonal PC (19 layers) is represented by a group of double
and open circles. An octagonal pattern is formed by rhombus
and square tiles with side length a = 69 µm. The bar parallel
to the x axis indicated by SL is a sampling line. Its center is
on the y axis at y = −377.16 µm, and its length is 138 µm.
(c) A group of double and 5 inside open circles represents a
6-rod Penrose PC, and a group of double, 5 inside open, and
10 closed circles represents a 16-rod Penrose PC. The whole
set of circles represents a 31-rod Penrose PC. The tiles of the
Penrose pattern are formed by two kinds of rhombus tiles with
side length a = 85 µm. The sampling lines SL1 and SL2 are
for the 6-rod PC at 0 and 18 degrees, respectively. The center
of SL1 is at y = −26.4 µm, and SL2 is obtained by rotation
of SL1 by 18 degrees around the origin. The sampling line
SL3 is for the 16- and 33-rod PCs at 0 degrees, and its center
is at y = −106.17 µm. The length of each sampling line is 68
µm. (d) A 187-rod Penrose PC (34 layers) is represented by
open circles. The side length a of the rhombi is 85 µm. The
bar parallel to the x axis indicated by SL is a sampling line
whose length is 85 µm. This PC and the 186-rod PC shown
in Fig. 1(a) have almost the same sizes and correspond to
two diﬀerent regions inside a colossal Penrose PC with 3946
rods. This rod arrangement does not contain a central rod.

to spectra of the 186-rod PC (33 layers) in Fig. 1(a) and
187-rod PC (34 layers) in Fig. 1(d). The upper spectrum
has been shifted at an interval of 2. The arrow indicates the
position of an angle-dependent dip.

in Ultra-high-Q Optical Microcavities

Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in ultra-high-Q surface-tension-induced spherical and chip-
based toroid microcavities is considered both theoretically and experimentally. These microcavities
are fabricated from silica, exhibit small mode volume (typically 1000 µm3) and possess whispering-
gallery type modes with long photon storage times (in the range of 100 ns), signiﬁcantly reducing
the threshold for stimulated nonlinear optical phenomena. Oscillation threshold levels of less than
100 µ-Watts of launched ﬁber pump power, in microcavities with quality factors of 100 million are
observed. Using a steady state analysis of the coupled-mode equations for the pump and Raman
whispering-gallery modes, the threshold, eﬃciencies and cascading properties of SRS in UHQ devices
are derived. The results are experimentally conﬁrmed in the telecommunication band (1550nm)
using tapered optical ﬁbers as highly eﬃcient waveguide coupling elements for both pumping and
signal extraction. The device performance dependence on coupling, quality factor and modal volume
are measured and found to be in good agreement with theory. This includes analysis of the threshold
and eﬃciency for cascaded Raman scattering. The side-by-side study of nonlinear oscillation in
both spherical microcavities and toroid microcavities on-a-chip also allows for comparison of their
properties. In addition to the beneﬁts of a wafer-scale geometry, including integration with optical,
electrical or mechanical functionality, microtoroids on-a-chip exhibit single mode Raman oscillation
over a wide range of pump powers.

INTRODUCTION

Ultra-high-Q ( UHQ) surface-tension-induced micro-
cavities (which we subsequently refer to as STIMs) com-
bine small modal volume with some of the highest op-
tical quality-factors (Q) to date of nearly 10 billion [1],
and are of interest for a variety of studies ranging from
fundamental physics such as cavity quantum electrody-
namics [2][3][4] to applied areas such as low threshold
and narrow linewidth lasers [5][6][7], nonlinear optical
oscillators[8][9], as well as high-sensitivity transducers for
biochemical sensing[10]. These silica microcavities fea-
ture whispering gallery type modes (WGMs) and rely
upon exquisite smoothness at the cavity dielectric bound-
ary to attain ultra-high-Q performance that is typically
in excess of 100 million. For nonlinear optical studies,
strong resonant buildup of energy in microscale volumes
signiﬁcantly reduces the threshold for nonlinear optical
eﬀects to occur. This was recognized in the pioneering
work of Chang [11][12] and Campillo [13][14][15]who ob-
served and studied a variety of nonlinear optical eﬀects in
ultra-high-Q liquid microdoplets. Their work used free-
space illumination to optically pump the microdroplets
and thereby induce Raman oscillation [12][13][15], cas-
caded Raman scattering [12] and Brillouin scattering[16].
Silica UHQ STIMs provide a far more stable and robust
microcavity in comparison with liquid microdroplets.
However, despite numerous studies on these devices over
the past decade [17][18][19][20][21][22][23] [24][25][26]the
observation of nonlinear phenomena (beyond thermal ef-
fects) in these devices, had been limited to one report
on Kerr-induced wavelength shifts at low temperatures

[20]. The advent of pumping and signal collection using
ﬁber taper coupling methods [27][28][29][30] proved an
important turning point in access to nonlinear phenom-
ena in this important micro-cavity system. Fiber tapers
provide remarkably eﬃcient coupling to and from the
UHQ silica sphere system [28][30]and enable direct ac-
cess to the technologically important optical ﬁber trans-
port medium. The measured ﬁber-coupled threshold for
a variety of nonlinear phenomena in taper-coupled, silica
microspheres are lower than for any other nonlinear oscil-
lator reported to date. Silica microsphere Raman lasers
with ultra-low threshold levels of only 62 µ-Watts [31]
have been demonstrated. Compared to microdroplets
these devices allow stable and long term observation of
nonlinear optical eﬀects in microcavities. Cascaded Ra-
man lasing in these devices of up to 5 orders has also
been observed [32] . The tapered optical ﬁber in these
experiments functions to both pump WGMs as well as
to extract the nonlinear Raman ﬁelds. In addition, the
tapered-ﬁber coupling junction is highly ideal[28], mak-
ing it possible to strongly overcouple ultra-high-Q cav-
ities with negligible junction loss. This feature allows
for the observation of very high internal diﬀerential pho-
ton conversion eﬃciencies approaching unity. Whereas
microspheres are both compact and eﬃcient nonlinear
oscillators, their fabrication properties lack the control
and parallelism typical of microfabrication techniques.
Recently-developed ultra-high-Q toroid microcavities on-
a-chip [33] provide a UHQ silica device with performance
equivalent to a microsphere. UHQ toroids have several
advantages over spheres including being wafer-scale de-
vices that can be fabricated in parallel as dense arrays
or integrated with electronics or other optical functional-

ity. In this paper, we demonstrate and analyze nonlinear
Raman oscillation in both microsphere and microtoroid
on-a-chip structures. In addition to studying Raman os-
cillation in microcavities in detail, this work allows us
to compare the performance and properties of toroidal
and spherical microcavities. In addition to their fabri-
cation and integration advantages, it will be seen that
microtoroids also have performance advantages in com-
parison to microspheres. This includes a reduced number
of supported azimuthal modes, which allows observation
of single-mode Raman oscillation over a large range of
pump powers[34] (of critical importance in practical ap-
plications), as well lower Raman threshold due to a re-
duced mode volume compared to a spherical cavity.

The paper is organized as follows. The ﬁrst section
will give a brief introduction into the fabrication, cou-
pling and optical properties of ultra-high-Q toroid on-a-
chip and spherical microcavities. The second section will
present a model for Raman lasing in a waveguide-coupled
whispering-gallery-mode resonator. There, we derive the
expression for the threshold and the eﬃciency of the con-
version process. In the ultra-high-Q regime resonances
are easily split into doublets due to intermode coupling
of the degenerate clockwise and counterclockwise prop-
agating whispering gallery modes[35]. The eﬀect of this
intermode coupling on stimulated Raman scattering is
also considered in this section. The case of cascaded Ra-
man oscillation in which Raman signals serve to pump
and generate higher-order Raman waves is also treated in
the section. In the fourth section, the theoretical results
are compared with experimental studies of the depen-
dence of Raman threshold on quality-factor, mode vol-
ume and waveguide loading. Experimental results con-
cerning power and eﬃciency during cascaded operation
are presented and compared to theory and found to be
in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Finally,
a comparison of microtoroid oscillation properties with
those of microspheres is presented in the ﬁfth section.

II. ULTRA-HIGH-Q
SURFACE-TENSION-INDUCED
MICROCAVITIES

Surface-tension-induced microcavities such as micro-
droplets, exhibit a superb, cavity surface ﬁnish (typically
nanometer surface roughness[1]) leading to whispering
gallery type modes with some of the highest optical qual-
ity factors recorded to date. In the work presented here,
both spherical and toroid microcavities on-a-chip made
from silica are investigated. Both types of structures ex-
hibit Q-factors in excess of 100 million. Brieﬂy, the fabri-
cation of both micro-sphere and micro-toroids relies upon
surface tension to induce collapse of a given silica preform
into the ﬁnal cavity shape. Because the cavity fabrica-
tion involves a temporary liquid state the surface ﬁnish of

the ﬁnal ”solid” microcavity is excellent. In the case of a
microsphere, the preform used here is an optical ﬁber tip
which is heated and melted with a carbon-dioxide laser
(10.6 µm wavelength). Surface tension causes the silica
ﬁber tip to contract and form a spherical microcavity,
while the remainder of the ﬁber stem serves as a holder
for sphere-positioning. Light within the sphere is con-
ﬁned near an equatorial plane by continuous total inter-
nal reﬂection at the cavity interface. Microtoroids, on the
other hand, use wafer microfabrication techniques involv-
ing a combination of lithography and etching combined
with a ﬁnal selective reﬂow process using a CO2 laser.
The details of this fabrication process are reported in
reference [33]. In the case of toroid microcavities the pre-
form consists of a microfabricated silica disk supported
by a silicon pillar. Illumination of the disk using a CO2
laser induces selective reﬂow of the silica. Surface ten-
sion causes the disk preform to collapse into a toroidal
periphery, thereby creating the resonant cavity. Figure
1 contains an optical micrograph of a microsphere and a
microtoroid on-a-chip.

Highly eﬃcient evanescent coupling to these micro-
cavities can be achieved by use of tapered optical ﬁbers
[30][28], which are fabricated by melting and adiabati-
cally tapering a standard, telecommunication ﬁber un-
til a waist diameter of approximately 1 to 2 microns is
reached. When brought into proximity of the WGM res-
onator and when the taper waist diameter is chosen to
phase match to the WGMs, eﬃcient coupling both to
and from the microcavity can be achieved. Coupling
can be described by the normalized coupling parameter
Kp =
which describes the ratio of intrinsic res-
onator lifetime τ 0 to the external (coupling related) life-
time τ ex. Following the standard conventions[36], under-
coupling is denoted by K < 1, overcoupling by K > 1,
and critical coupling (the point of vanishing waveguide
transmission) is denoted by K = 1. The ability to achieve
strong overcoupling is important as it exempliﬁes the
very ideal nature[28] of the taper-microcavity, coupling
junction. In addition to eﬃcient excitation and extrac-
tion of optical power, the ﬁber taper provides direct cou-
pling to optical ﬁber, thereby further facilitating labora-

Brillouin gain spectrum unlikely and was not observed
in this work. In the case of parametric oscillation me-
diated by the Kerr-nonlinearity (i.e. four-wave mixing),
energy conservation requires a triple resonance condition
for signal, idler and pump mode, which can be satis-
ﬁed only under certain conditions[37]. These additional
constraints for oscillation based on the Kerr nonlinearity
or Brillouin gain, cause stimulated Raman scattering -
which is intrinsically phase-matched- to be the dominant
microcavity nonlinear optical eﬀect. For simpliﬁcation,
we assume that the pump wavelength and the Raman
wave are on resonance and use the slowly varying enve-
lope approximation.

the taper is also crucial as a means of ”probing” the whis-
pering gallery devices which are within a few microns of
the silicon wafer surface.

Using tapered optical ﬁbers, resonator quality factor
can be inferred from either linewidth measurements or
cavity ringdown experiments[33]. Figure 2 shows a cav-
ity ringdown measurement on a 45-µm-diameter micro-
toroid at 1550 nm, exhibiting a critically coupled Q of
108. In this measurement the WGM was excited on reso-
nance, and the ﬁber-taper adjusted to the critical point.
The cavity lifetime can then be inferred by gating-oﬀ the
excitation laser, and recording the cavity decay signal.
The critically coupled Q (including the waveguide cou-
pling contributions) was 100 million, and when correcting
the Q for the waveguide loading, as described in section
108 is inferred.

Raman scattering in a waveguide coupled microcav-

which can compete with Raman scattering, such as Four-
wave-mixing or Brillouin scattering are not considered
in this analysis as the microcavity poses stringent fre-
quency matching constraints on these processes making
their observation diﬃcult. In the case of Stimulated Bril-

where Vef f is the eﬀective modal volume [38], and ~E is
the electric ﬁeld vector [2]. The eﬀective mode volume ac-
counts for the intensity dependent gain, and for silica mi-
crospheres and microtoroids has approximately twice the
value than the energy related deﬁnition of mode volume.
Steady state analysis of the coupled mode equations, re-
sults in a clamped, cavity, pump ﬁeld above threshold.
This clamping alters the coupling of pump power to the
resonator, and, in turn, the pump power dependence of
Raman laser power such that the following square root

The physical origin of this square root dependence of the
pump-to-Raman conversion can be viewed as a “pump-
ing ineﬃciency” i.e. the coupled pump power does not
increase linearly with launched ﬁber power. The nonlin-
ear dependence of coupled pump power can be illustrated
by considering a pump wave that is initially critically
coupled to the resonator. As noted above, critical cou-
pling features complete transfer and dissipation of power
from the resonator (i.e., zero transmission).
In terms
of the ﬁelds involved in coupling both to and from the
resonator, critical coupling results from the destructive
interference of the cavity leakage ﬁeld with the trans-
mitted, pump ﬁeld (i.e., the portion that does not cou-
ple to the resonator from the waveguide). Once the on-
set of Raman lasing is reached, the cavity pump ﬁeld is
clamped at the threshold value resulting in a ﬁxed cav-
ity pump leakage ﬁeld. Subsequent increase in launched
pump power will imbalance the leakage and the transmit-
ted pump ﬁelds, giving rise to ﬁnite transmission and a
shift away from the critical point. The pump coupling to
the resonator is thereby less and less eﬃcient as the pump
ﬁeld is increased. The expression for the Raman thresh-
old pump power can be factorized into terms involving
modal volume, waveguide-cavity coupling strength and
cavity lifetime (or Quality factor). To facilitate separa-
tion of the coupling and intrinsic lifetime dependence,
we use the dimensionless normalized coupling parameter
Kp =
. In the ideal case of a single-mode waveg-

and K typically varies exponentially with

Using these deﬁnitions and under the assumption of equal

Here we have also introduced C(Γ) which is a possible
correction factor to account for intermode coupling of the
degenerate clockwise and counterclockwise propagating
whispering-gallery modes. This factor will be explained
in the next section. The threshold expression follows an
inverse square dependence on the quality factor. This re-
ﬂects the fact that an increase in Q will cause a twofold
beneﬁt in terms of both reducing cavity round trip losses
that must be overcome for threshold as well as increasing
the Raman gain, due to the intensity dependence of the
Raman gain coeﬃcient on the pump ﬁeld. In addition,
the equation shows that the threshold scales linearly with

It is worth noting that at this coupling condition, the cir-

This can be understood since minimum threshold repre-
sents an optimal balance of both pump coupling and Ra-
man mode coupling loss. The conversion of pump power
to Raman power above threshold can be characterized by
the diﬀerential slope eﬃciency. The bidirectional exter-

grows more quickly in the overcoupled (more slowly in

B. The eﬀect of intermode coupling on stimulated
Raman scattering

In the ultra-high-Q regime, resonances of a whispering-
gallery-type microcavity are often split into doublets[17]
[35]. This splitting is due to coupling of the degenerate
clockwise and counterclockwise propagating modes by ei-
ther intrinsic or surface scattering centers. The modiﬁed
coupling properties have been extensively studied [39].
Here we brieﬂy summarize the results of this study and
analyze the eﬀect of intermode coupling on Raman scat-
tering. The extent to which intermode coupling modiﬁes
the waveguide coupling properties can be described by
the dimensionless intermode coupling parameter Γ = τ 0
γ ,
where 1/γ is the rate of coupling of the degenerate clock-
wise and counterclockwise modes. It is easily measured
as the linewidth normalized splitting in the undercoupled
regime (see ﬁgure 4 inset). The presence of intermode
coupling has several consequences. First, the critical
point (as deﬁned by vanishing waveguide transmission)
is shifted towards a coupling point, which, using the con-
ventional coupling terminology, is considered overcoupled
as τ ex < τ 0.The point of vanishing transmission occurs
at:

Kcrit =

Γ2 + 1

(8)

p
Second, the shifted critical point is accompanied by a
maximum reﬂection into the backwards direction of the
waveguide (i.e. the contra-directional waveguide mode).
The magnitude of the reﬂection at the above modiﬁed
critical point is given by

Rmax =

Γ
√Γ2 + 1 + 1 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

Third, the leakage of the cavity ﬁeld into the back-
wards waveguide direction causes a reduction of the cav-
ity buildup factor with respect to the ideal case in the ab-
sence of intermode coupling. In the limit of strong modal
coupling, the cavity buildup factor is reduced by a factor
of 2, which subsequently causes a twofold increase in the
threshold necessary to achieve Raman lasing. Figure 4
shows the circulating power correction factor C(Γ) as a
function of the dimensionless intermode coupling param-
eter Γ. In the presence of modal coupling the waveguide
coupling condition for minimum threshold experiences a
slight shift towards overcoupling with the maximum shift
occurring at Γ
1.52. In the regime of very strong modal
coupling the condition of minimum Raman threshold ap-
proaches again the original condition K = 1/2.

C. Analysis of Cascaded Raman Scattering in
high-Q microcavities

The ﬁrst Raman ﬁeld can itself act as a secondary
pump ﬁeld and generate further Raman modes. This
process of cascaded Raman scattering can be described
by including higher order coupling terms into the cou-
pled mode equations of pump and Raman ﬁelds as shown

The general solutions for the threshold of the even and

expressions. As in the previous section, we have assumed
equal coupling strengths and intrinsic Q factors for the

As evident from these expressions even and odd order
stokes ﬁelds exhibit diﬀerent threshold powers as a func-
tion of stokes order (N). When considering Raman scat-
tering in silica at optical frequencies, one can approxi-
1 since the
mate the above expressions by taking ci ≈
Raman shift is small compared to the optical frequency.
In addition it is assumed that the mode volume is wave-
length independent. Under this assumption, the thresh-
old expressions reduce to:

It follows that the threshold for cascaded Raman oscil-
lation exhibits a cubic dependence on Raman order N.
The emission power dependences vary depending upon
whether the highest order wave is even or odd. For the
odd order case, all odd orders increase as the square root
of the pump power and even orders are clamped. For
the even order case, all even order lines increase linearly
with pump power while odd orders are clamped. Figure

FIG. 5: Theoretical plot of cascaded Raman output power
versus pump power for up to fourth order Stokes power. Even
and odd ordered Raman modes exhibit alternating clamping
behaviour.

several stokes orders as a function of input pump power.
The analytic expressions for the Raman output power in
these cases are given by:

The diﬀerential power conversion eﬃciencies can be ob-
tained by linearizing the above expressions near the
threshold condition. The external and internal diﬀer-
ential eﬃciencies decrease steadily as a function of stokes
order (N ). For optical frequencies that are much larger
than the Raman shift, the external diﬀerential conversion
eﬃciency reduces to:

FIG. 7: Spectrally resolved Raman emission of the ultra-high-
Q microsphere shown in the previous ﬁgure, revealing that 5
eccentricity split azimuthal modes were oscillating simultane-
ously. The pump power in this measurement was adjusted
to slightly above Raman oscillation threshold. The assym-
metric line-shape of the Raman modes is caused by repeat-
edly scanning the pump laser through the pump resonance,
which causes a redshift of the cavity resonances, due to heat-
ing and subsequent expansion of the cavity (thermal bistabil-
ity as noted in [17]).

trol of the taper-microcavity coupling gap (20 nm resolu-
tion) and variation of the waveguide-resonator coupling

To excite the UHQ modes, we used a narrow-linewidth,

external-cavity laser emitting in the 1550 nm band. In
the case of microspheres, the WGM ﬁeld spatial forms are
known analytically and characterized by the radial, angu-
lar, azimuthal and polarization mode number (n, ℓ, m, p).
Due to fabrication-induced eccentricity, the (2ℓ + 1)-fold-
degeneracy of the azimuthal modes is lifted yielding a
complex mode spectrum. For the spheres considered in
this work the eccentricity-induced splitting was in the
range of several GigaHertz. Microtoroids on-a-chip, on
the other hand, possess a signiﬁcantly reduced mode
spectrum due to the strong azimuthal modal conﬁne-
ment provided by the toroid geometry. This both simpli-
ﬁes their spectra and enables operation of microtoroid-
Raman lasers in the desirable single mode regime, which
is of signiﬁcant practical importance.

Stimulated Raman oscillation was observed by pump-
ing a single WGM and monitoring the transmission us-
ing an optical spectrum analyzer. Once the threshold
for SRS was exceeded,
lasing modes in the 1650-nm
band could be observed, in correspondence with the peak
Raman gain which occurs downshifted in frequency by
approximately 14 THz relative to the pump frequency
(wavelength shift of approximately 110 nm). Figure 6
shows Raman emission for an ultra-high-Q microsphere.
The Raman emission with respect to the gain peak is pro-
vided in the inset of ﬁgure 6. Since the fundamental whis-
pering gallery modes (n = 1, ℓ = m, p = T M ) are most
tightly conﬁned (i.e., smallest mode volume), Raman las-
ing is expected to occur ﬁrst for these modes. The pres-
ence of nearly degenerate azimuthal modes in a spherical
microcavity (i.e., weak eccentricity splitting), causes si-
multaneous oscillation on several azimuthal modes. Fig-
ure 7 shows a higher resolution spectral scan of the spec-
trum in ﬁgure 6. Several azimuthal modes can be ob-
served to be oscillating simultaneously.

The threshold formula predicts a strong dependence
of the Raman threshold on waveguide coupling. Figure
8 shows the measured Raman threshold as a function of
taper-microcavity gap distance for a fundamental WGM.
The solid line is a ﬁt using the theoretical results from the
ﬁrst section (equation 3) and assuming equal pump and
Raman Q factors and coupling conditions. The minimum
threshold does indeed occur undercoupled with ﬁnite ta-
per transmission at T = 13% in good agreement with the
theoretically predicted value of T = 1/9.

As a further veriﬁcation of the threshold formula we
compared the theoretical minimum threshold value with
the observed value. The quality factor and the mode
splitting of the whispering-gallery mode were measured
by performing a linewidth sweep in the undercoupled
regime, where the backscattering-induced doublet struc-
ture is most pronounced. These measurements yielded
108 and Γ = 2 . The size of the microsphere was

evidenced by the taper-micro-cavity gap distance. The taper-
microcavity gap is measured in microns with respect to the
critical point (deﬁned as vanishing taper transmission), and
positive separation corresponds to overcoupling. The mini-
mum threshold is 62 µW of launched pump power (measured
before the taper which includes the insertion loss of the op-
tical ﬁber taper). Minimum threshold occurs ca. 120 nm
undercoupled (corresponding to a transmission of 13%).

a double logarithmic plot of the data. A linear ﬁt obtains

theoretically expected dependence of R1.83.

agreement with the experimentally measured value of 62
µW atts.

The dependence of the Raman threshold on the modal
volume was also investigated. For this measurement the
Raman threshold was measured for micro-sphere res-
onators having varying diameters in the range of ca.
25-120 µm.
(For diameters smaller than 25-µm ther-
mally induced wavelength shifts lead to pumping insta-
bilities.) In this diameter range, the mode volume follows
an approximately quadratic dependence (actual inferred
R1.83 [41] [40]) on the sphere radius.
exponent is V
As an aside, for smaller spheres the mode volume de-
viates from this behavior and ultimately, for very small
diameters, the mode volume increases due to weaken-
ing of the whispering gallery conﬁnement[40]. The min-
imum mode volume occurs for a radius of 6.9µm (for
ℓ = m = 34)[40] for 1550 nm wavelength and the mode
volume is Vmin = 173.1µm3. However, this size is not op-
timum for stimulated Raman scattering as the additional
beneﬁt of reduced mode volume is more than oﬀset by
the signiﬁcant decrease in Q factor to 105[41](Threshold
V /Q2). For small mode volumes, it has been
power
predicted that the gain coeﬃcient can exhibit a depen-
dence on mode volume due to cavity QED eﬀects[14].
However, in the case of stimulated Raman Scattering in
silica microspheres these eﬀects are not expected to be

observable [42] and an approximately quadratic relation-
ship due to the mode volume is predicted.

metric dependence of the Raman threshold using data
from cavities having diﬀerent resonant characteristics,
the threshold data were normalized to the set of param-
eters (Q0 = 108, Γ = 0, gR = gmax
R ). The result of this
procedure is shown in ﬁgure 9. The data indeed show
a quadratic dependence on R (the actual ﬁtted exponen-
tial from a double logarithmic plot is 1.95 and is in good
agreement with the expected value of 1.83) and conﬁrm

In addition to ﬁrst order Raman scattering, we have
also observed cascaded Raman scattering. Figure 10
shows a typical cascaded Raman spectrum, for a UHQ
microcavity pumped at 1450 nm. The pump-to-Raman
conversion characteristics for ﬁrst order Raman scatter-
ing and the 2nd order Raman mode are shown in the
inset. It can be seen that the ﬁrst order mode does in-
deed exhibit a square-root dependence on the launched

The higher order Raman mode exhibits the expected lin-
ear increase with pump power.

To study cascaded Raman scattering beyond 2nd order,
experiments using a 980 nm wavelength pump [32] were
employed. The shorter wavelength pump allowed the
observation of up-to 5th-order cascades (from 980-1300
nm) owing to the reduced mode volume at shorter wave-
lengths, and the higher Raman gain coeﬃcient (gR ∝

1/λ). With less than 900 µ-Watts of launched ﬁber power
up to ﬁfth order Stimulated Raman Scattering was ob-
served [32], and the threshold and eﬃciency of the cas-
cades measured. Figure 11 shows the Cascaded Raman
threshold for a microsphere as a function of the order of
the cascade, for ﬁxed coupling condition. The solid line
is a cubic ﬁt (as predicted by equation 11), which yields
good qualitative agreement with the experimentally mea-
sured thresholds. The inset of ﬁgure 11 shows a double
logarithmic plot of the measured diﬀerential conversion
eﬃciency of the cascaded Raman scattering process. The
eﬃciency of the cascades decreases as a function of Stokes
order, as is theoretically predicted by equation 13.

V. RAMAN SCATTERING IN ULTRA-HIGH-Q
TOROID MICROCAVITIES ON-A-CHIP.

Toroid microcavities allow on-chip integration of ultra-
high-Q performance with other optical, mechanical and
electrical functionality. In addition the wafer-scale fab-
rication process allows precise dimensional control and
parallelism. Figure 12 shows a scanning electron mi-
croscope of a toroid microcavity.
In addition to the
design freedom and control brought about by micro-
fabrication and integration possibilities, toroid microcav-
ities also exhibit signiﬁcant advantages in terms of their
Raman-emission properties. Whereas microsphere cavi-
ties show low threshold operation, their emission is in-
herently multi-mode due to the presence of azimuthal
modes, as shown in ﬁgure 7 of the previous section. In
contrast, toroid microcavities on-a-chip have a signiﬁ-
cantly reduced mode spectrum, such that single mode
Raman lasing can be observed. The reduced number of
azimuthal modes is due to the cavity geometry, which
supports only a few modes in the azimuthal direction
due to the toroidal conﬁnement[26]. Figure 13 shows the
mode spectrum of a toroid microcavity. Only two higher
order modes are present in the spectrum, and successive
modes are separated by the free spectral range of the
cavity, which in the ﬁgure is 10 nm. This is in contrast
to a microsphere of identical principal diameter which
would support 2ℓ + 1 azimuthal modes weakly split by
eccentricity.

The suppression of azimuthal modes, has important
consequences on the spectral emission properties of sin-
gle and cascaded Raman scattering. Most notably, sin-
gle transverse mode Raman oscillation can be observed
over a large range of pump powers. Figure 14 shows
a toroid microcavity Raman laser, which exhibits sin-
gle mode oscillation at emission power levels up to 160
µW atts with high eﬃciency (45% at the critical point).
The single-mode emission property is a signiﬁcant advan-
tage in practical applications of nonlinear optical oscil-
lators. Toroidal and spherical microcavities having sim-
ilar Q and outer diameter will diﬀer in modal volume.
Toroids, owing to the added transverse conﬁnement will

uses a ﬁnite element mode solver as there are no analyt-
ical expressions available for toroid mode volume. The
case of d = 50 µm corresponds to a sphere. Overall, the
toroidal mode volume can be seen to be lower than the
sphere. There are also two distinct regimes of mode vol-
ume behavior. In the ﬁrst, the mode volume reduces very

index conﬁnement resulting from the toroidal boundary
being comparable in diameter to the mode ﬁeld. The
inset to this ﬁgure provides mode ﬁelds for the toroid
in these two regimes to further illustrate this idea. It is
clear that substantial reductions in threshold are possible
using these devices. We are currently characterizing the
reductions possible experimentally.

VI. SUMMARY

In summary we have experimentally and theoretically
analyzed Raman oscillation in ﬁber-taper-coupled micro-
spheres and microtoroids on-a-chip. A theoretical anal-
ysis was presented using the coupled mode equations for
the pump and Raman WGMs. Using these equations,
the threshold condition for stimulated Raman scatter-
ing was derived and the relative importance of waveg-
uide coupling strength, mode volume and intrinsic res-
onator Q were described. These theoretical dependences
were veriﬁed experimentally. Furthermore the analysis
was extended to the case of cascaded Raman oscilla-
tion and threshold and eﬃciency expressions were de-
rived for higher-order Raman ﬁelds. This analysis re-
vealed that odd and even order Raman lines exhibit dif-
ferent pump-to-Raman emission characteristics. Even or-
der Stokes ﬁelds are found to exhibit a linear increase in
generated Raman power as a function of pump power,
whereas odd-order Stokes ﬁelds exhibit a square root de-
pendence. Analysis showed and experiment conﬁrmed
that the threshold for N-th-order cascaded Raman oscil-
lation exhibits a cubic dependence on order and that the
associated eﬃciency of the process scales inverse quadrat-
ically with order.

Microtoroids, in addition to having signiﬁcant practical
advantages with respect to their chip-based fabrication,
have both spectral and power eﬃciency advantages in

11

comparison to Raman oscillation in microspheres. Their
stronger lateral conﬁnement provides two distinct bene-
ﬁts. First, a drastic reduction in the complexity of the
mode spectrum enabling single-mode oscillation in the
microtoroid based device. Second, a controllable and re-
duced mode volume so that for comparable Q factors,
microtoroid devices should have lower threshold pump
powers. We are currently investigating the latter advan-
tage experimentally.

The importance of ﬁber taper coupling in these mea-
surements cannot be over emphasized. These inher-
ently ﬁber-compatible waveguides provide exceptional
coupling eﬃciencies to and from the ultra-high-Q de-
vices. They are also indispensable in coupling to the
microtoroid devices which reside near the surface of a sil-
icon wafer. Using taper coupling, the lowest threshold
observed in this study was 62 µWatts of launched power,
a value which is nearly 3-orders of magnitude lower than
for free-space illumination of micro-droplets.

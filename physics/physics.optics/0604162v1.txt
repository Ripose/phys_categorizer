We study light transmission through a homeotropically oriented nematic liquid crystal cell and
solve self-consistently a nonlinear equation for the nematic director coupled to Maxwell’s equations.
We demonstrate that above a certain threshold of the input light intensity, the liquid-crystal cell
changes abruptly its optical properties due to the light-induced Freedericksz transition, demonstrat-
ing multistable hysteresis-like dependencies in the transmission. We suggest that these properties
can be employed for tunable all-optical switching photonic devices based on liquid crystals.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Liquid crystals (LCs) play an important role in the
modern technologies being used for numerous applica-
tions in electronic imaging, display manufacturing, and
optoelectronics [1, 2]. A large variety of electro-optical ef-
fects that may occur in LCs can be employed for a design
of photonic devices. For example, the property of LCs to
change its orientational structure and the refractive in-
dex in the presence of a static electric ﬁeld suggests one
of the most attractive and practical schemes for tuning
the photonic bandgap devices [3, 4]. Nonlinear optical
properties of LCs and multistability of light transmission
are of a great interest for the future applications of LCs
in photonics [5].

This eﬀect

is
widely known as the light-induced Freedericksz transition
(LIFT), and its theory was developed more than two
decades ago in a number of the pioneering papers [7, 8, 9].
In particular, Zeldovich et al. [7] demonstrated that the
light-induced Freedericksz transition can generally be
treated as the second-order orientational transition, but
in some types of LCs hysteresis-like dependencies and
two thresholds can be observed, for the increasing and
decreasing intensity of the input light. The results ob-
tained later by Ong [10] conﬁrmed that for the MBBA
nematics the Freedericksz transition is of the second or-
der and there is no hysteresis behavior, whereas for the
PAA nematics the Freedericksz transition is of the ﬁrst
order and the hysteresis-like behavior with two distinct
thresholds should be observed. Although these conclu-
sions have been conﬁrmed to some extent in later experi-
ments [10], the theory developed earlier was based on the
geometrical optics and by its nature is approximate. The
similar approximation was used later [11] for taking into
account a backward wave in a LC ﬁlm placed in a Fabry-
Perot resonator, where it was shown that the threshold
of the Freedericksz transition depends periodically on the
LC cell thickness.

Nonlinear optical properties of a nematic LC ﬁlm in

a Fabry-Perot interferometer was studied by Khoo et
al. [12], who considered the propagation of light polarized
under an acute angle to the LC director and observed
experimentally bistability in the output light intensity
caused by giant nonlinearity of the LC ﬁlm. Cheung et
al. [13] observed experimentally the eﬀects of multista-
bility in a similar system, including oscillations of the
output light intensity.

However, in spite of numerous theoretical studies and
experimental observations, a self-consistent theory of the
light-induced Freedericksz transition based on a system-
atic analysis of the coupled equations for the nematic
director and electromagnetic ﬁeld is still missing. There-
fore, the purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we
consider a general problem of the light transmission
through a homeotropically-oriented nematic LC and an-
alyze the speciﬁc conditions for the multistability and
light-induced Freedericksz transition, for possible appli-
cations in all-optical switching photonic devices. Sec-
ond, for the ﬁrst time to our knowledge, we consider this
problem self-consistently and solve numerically a coupled
system of the stationary equations for the director and
Maxwell’s equations. We present our results for two kinds
of nematic liquid crystal, para-azoxyanisole (PAA) and
Np-methoxybenzylidene-np-butylaniline (MBBA), which
show quite dissimilar behavior of the nematic director
at the Freedericksz transition in the previous theoreti-
cal studies [10], and also discuss light transmission and
bistability thresholds as functions of the cell thickness.

The paper is organized as follows. Sections II and III
present our basic equations and outline our numerical
approach. Section IV summarizes our results for two
kinds of nematic liquid crystal and discusses in detail
both bistability and hysteresis-type behavior of the light
transmission. Section V concludes the paper.

II. BASIC EQUATIONS

We consider a nematic LC cell conﬁned between two
planes (z = 0 and z = L) with the director initially ori-
ented along the z axis (see Fig. 1). The LC cell interacts
with a normally incident monochromatic electromagnetic

wave described by the electric ﬁeld E(r, t),

fE = −

εik = ε⊥δik + εanink.

To derive the basic equations, we write the free energy
of the LC cell in the presence of the electromagnetic wave
as follows [7]

F =

(fel + fE)dV,

Here fel is the LC elastic energy density, fE is a contri-
bution to the free energy density from the light ﬁeld, n
is the nematic director, Kii are the elastic constants, εik
is the LC dielectric permittivity tensor, εa = εk − ε⊥ > 0
describes anisotropy of the LC dielectric susceptibility,
where εk and ε⊥ are the main components of the tensor
εik parallel and perpendicular to the director, respec-
tively.

We assume that outside the LC cell the electric ﬁeld
is directed along the x axis (see Fig. 1), which can cause
the director reorientation in the xz plane inside the LC
cell. When the incident beam is broad, we can describe
it as a plane wave, so that all functions inside the LC
cell will depend only on the z-coordinate. Therefore, we
can seek the spatial distribution of the nematic director
in the form

n(r) = ex sin φ(z) + ez cos φ(z),
(3)
where φ is the angle between the director and the z axis
(see Fig. 1), ex and ez are the unit vectors in the Carte-
sian coordinate frame.

After minimizing the free energy (2) with respect to
the director angle φ, we obtain the stationary equation
for the LC director orientation in the presence of the light
ﬁeld

where we take into account that, as follows from
Maxwell’s equations, the electric vector of the light
ﬁeld inside the LC cell has the longitudinal component
Ez(z) = −(εzx/εzz)Ex(z).

From Maxwell’s equations, we obtain the scalar equa-

tion for the x-component of the electric ﬁeld,

where k = 2πλ/c, and λ is the wavelength of the incident

vector, Sz = (c/8π)ExH ∗
y , remains unchanged inside the
LC cell [7, 10], and it can be used for characterizing dif-
ferent regimes of the nonlinear transmission.

III. NUMERICAL APPROACH

We solve the system of coupled nonlinear equations
(4) and (5) in a self-consistent manner together with the
proper boundary conditions. For the director, we assume
the strong anchoring at the cell boundaries, i.e.

φ(0) = φ(L) = 0,

(6)

whereas for the electric ﬁeld we consider the standard
scattering conditions

Ex(0) = Ein + Eref , Ex(L) = Eout.

(7)

Here Ein, Eref , and Eout are the amplitudes of the inci-
dent, reﬂected, and outgoing waves, respectively. In all

equations above we consider the magnetic susceptibility
µ = +1, and the refractive index outside the cell ns = 1,
also taking into account that Hy = (1/ik)(dEx/dz).

The boundary conditions (7) imply that we consider
two counter-propagating waves on the left side of the LC
cell, incoming and reﬂecting, whereas only an outgoing
wave appears on the right side. Therefore, in order to
solve this nonlinear problem, ﬁrst we ﬁx the amplitude
of the outgoing wave Eout. It allows us to ﬁnd the unique
values of the incident Ein and reﬂected Eref waves.

Equation for the director (4) is similar to a general-
type equation for a nonlinear pendulum with the ﬁxed
boundary conditions (6). This means that we should
look for its periodic solutions with the period 2L. In fact,
there exist many periodic solutions of Eq. (4). First of
all, a trivial solution φ(z) = 0 corresponds to the undis-
turbed orientation distribution of the director and the
absolute minimum of the free energy (2). The Freeder-
icksz transition occurs when this trivial solution becomes
unstable for larger values of the input light intensity, and
the director angle φ(z) becomes nonzero. We ﬁnd this
solution numerically by using the well-known shooting
method [14]. By ﬁxing the amplitude of the outgoing
wave Eout and taking φ(L) = 0 at the right boundary,
we ﬁnd the values of the derivative (dφ/dz)z=L such that
after integration we obtain a vanishing value of the direc-
tor angle at the left boundary, φ(0) = 0. By analyzing
the nonlinear equation (4) in a two-dimensional phase
space, we can show that the corresponding solution lies
just below the separatrix curve, and it has no node be-
tween the points z = 0 and z = L. This observation
allows us to reduce signiﬁcantly the parameter region for
the required values of the derivative (dφ/dz)z=L. From
the obtained set of solutions we chose the solution that
corresponds to the absolute minimum of the free energy
(2).

We also take into account the fact that a ﬁnite energy
barrier can appear between the minima of the free energy
which correspond to the trivial and nontrivial solutions
for the director orientation angle φ(z). When the light
intensity decreases adiabatically, the director does not
return to its initial undisturbed position at the threshold
value of the ”up” Freedericksz transition, but it remains
in a disturbed state which corresponds to a local mini-
mum of the free energy; thus, the transition to the state
φ(z) = 0 takes place only when this energy barrier disap-
pears. This leads to a hysteresis-like dependence of the
director and the diﬀerent threshold values for the ”up”
and ”down” transitions in the director orientation.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

We solve the nonlinear transmission problem for two
kinds of nematic liquid crystals, para-azoxyanisole (PAA)
and Np-methoxybenzylidene-np-butylaniline (MBBA),
which possess diﬀerent signs of the parameter B =
(1 − 9ǫ||/(4ǫ⊥) − (K33 − K11)/K33)/4, which appears in

to their approach , the sign of this parameter B deter-
mines the order of the Freedericksz transition. For PAA
B < 00 and the Freedericksz transition should be of the
ﬁrst order, while for MBBA B > 0 and there should be
the second order transition.

We take the following physical parameters [10]: (a)
for PAA, K11 = 9.26 · 10−7dyn, K33 = 18 · 10−7dyn,
n0 = 1.595, ne = 1.995, at λ = 4800 A, and (b) for
MBBA, K11 = 6.95 · 10−7dyn, K33 = 8.99 · 10−7dyn,
n0 = 1.544, ne = 1.758, at λ = 6328 A; and consider two
values for the cell thickness, L = λ/n0 and L = 100µm.

(L = 100µm), the spatial distribution of the electric ﬁeld
is similar, but the number of the oscillations of the elec-
tric ﬁeld |Ex| inside the LC cell increases due to a larger
value of L/λ. For PAA, a very similar distribution of
the electric ﬁeld is found. Thus, we reveal an essentially
inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the electric ﬁeld
inside the LC cell, and the functions |Ex(z)| are diﬀerent
before and after the Freedericksz transition.

Spatial distribution of the director orientation angle
φ(z) inside the LC cell after the Freedericksz transition
is shown in Fig. 2(b) for the parameters of MBBA, for
L = λ/n0 and L = 100µm, respectively. On the same
plot, we show the function φ0 sin(πz/L) at φ0 = 1.483 for
comparison. We notice that the position of the maximum
of the director deviation angle can shift from the point
z = L/2, as a consequence of an asymmetric distribution
of the ﬁeld |Ex(z)| inside the LC cell. Spatial distribution
of the director angle φ(z) in the PAA cell has the same
character as that shown in Fig. 2(b) for MBBA.

In Fig. 3, we present our numerical results for a change
of the maximum deformation angle φmax of the director

as a function of the power density inside LC Sz for in-
creasing and decreasing light intensity, for both PAA and
MBBA and two values of the cell thickness, L = λ/n0
and L = 100µm. For both kinds of LC, we observe a
hysteresis-like dependence of the angle φmax and two dif-
ferent thresholds of the light-induced director reorienta-
′′, for the
tion: S′
z, for the increasing intensity, and Sz
decreasing intensity.
In both cases, these two thresh-
olds correspond to the ﬁrst-order transition. The results
are similar for two values of the LC cell thickness, see
Figs. 3(a-d). Thus, our results suggest that at the light-
induced Freedericksz transition the cells of both kinds
of LCs, PAA and MBBA, reveal hysteresis-like behavior
with the respect to Sz.

Dependencies of the amplitude of the outgoing wave
|Eout| on the amplitude of the incident wave |Ein| are
shown in Figs. 4(a-d) for the parameters of both PAA
and MBBA. Depending on the LC cell thickness L, the
cell transmission is characterized by either hysteresis or
multistability with respect to the incident wave ampli-

FIG. 4: (colour online) Multistable transmission of the LC cell, shown as the outgoing wave |Eout| vs. the incident wave |Ein|
for PAA: (a) L = λ/n0 and (b) L = 100µm, and for MBBA: (c) L = λ/n0 and (d) L = 100µm, respectively.

(L = λ/n0) only the hysteresis-like transmission is ob-
served; it is caused by the hysteresis behavior of the direc-
tor reorientation between ”up” and ”down” thresholds,
as presented in Figs. 4(a,c). However, for larger thickness
(L = 100µm) we observe the transmission multistability,
above the ”up” threshold for increasing light intensity,
and above the ”down” threshold for decreasing light in-
tensity [see Figs. 4(b,d)]. Multistability in our system is
similar to that of a nonlinear resonator, and is it deter-
mined by the resonator properties of a ﬁnite thickness of
the LC cell.

The thresholds of the director reorientation for in-
creasing and decreasing light intensities are shown in
Figs. 5(a,b), for PAA and MBBA, respectively, as func-
tions of the normalized thickness of the LC cell. Simi-
lar to the results of the geometrical optics approxima-
tion [7, 10], the threshold values are proportional to
(1/L)2, but they increase approximately in two times
due to an essentially inhomogeneous spatial distribution
of the electric ﬁeld inside the LC cell. A similar increase
of the threshold value for an inhomogeneous distribution

of the electric ﬁeld in the LC cell was also mentioned
by Lednei et al. [15]. In addition, for the ”up” thresh-
old we observe an additional periodic dependence of the
threshold value on the cell thickness L, which is typical
for resonators and is caused by an interference of two
counter-propagating waves in the LC cell. This result
agrees with the results obtained for LC in a Fabry-Perot
resonator [11]. The ”up” threshold is determined by a
competition between the electric ﬁeld forces and elastic
forces of the liquid crystal, and thus the interference dis-
tribution of the electric ﬁeld in the LC cell is important.
However, the ”down” threshold is deﬁned by the condi-
tion of the disappearance of a barrier between the local
and absolute minima of the LC free energy [7]. We sup-
pose that diﬀerence of these mechanisms leads to the dif-
ferent type of L-dependencies for the ”up” and ”down”
thresholds.

We should mention that our results diﬀer qualitatively
from the results of earlier studies [7, 10], where for MBBA
both hysteresis and bistability were not predicted. In the
simplest case of one traveling wave [7, 10], the conserva-

tion of the value of Sz during the Freedericksz transition
leads to the conservation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld am-
plitudes at the boundaries of the LC cell. However, in
the general case there always exists a reﬂected wave, so
that we have Sz = (c/8π)Ex(0)H ∗

Sin, Sref are the power densities of the incident and re-
ﬂected waves, respectively. In such a case, the conserva-

6

tion of Sz does not require the conservation of Sin and
Sref , so that the amplitudes of the electromagnetic ﬁelds
at z = 0 can change at the Freedericksz transition, as is
seen in Fig. 2. Thus, the problem solved in this paper
and that in Refs. [7, 10] corresponds to diﬀerent bound-
ary conditions. Therefore, we suggest that experimen-
tally observed the second order Freedericksz transition
for MBBA liquid crystal [8, 16] is caused by the weak
reﬂection from the boundaries of LC cell.
In that sit-
uation, the single wave approximation can be used and
results obtained in Refs. [7, 10] become valid.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have analyzed the light transmission through
homeotropically-oriented cell of a nematic liquid crystal,
and studied multistability and light-induced Freedericksz
transition. We have solved numerically the coupled sta-
tionary equations for the nematic director and electric
ﬁeld of the propagating electromagnetic wave, for two
kinds of liquid crystals (PAA and MBBA). We have found
that the liquid crystals of both kinds possess multistabil-
ity and hysteresis behavior in the transmission charac-
terized by two thresholds of the director reorientation,
so that for the increasing and decreasing light intensities
the Freedericksz transition is of the ﬁrst order.

We have demonstrated that the resonator eﬀects of the
liquid-crystal cell associated with the light reﬂection from
two boundaries are signiﬁcant, and they are responsible,
in particular, for the observed periodic dependence of
the threshold values and multistability of the transmit-
ted light as a function of the cell thickness. We expect
that these features will become important for the study
of periodic photonic structures with holes ﬁlled in liquid
crystals [17] where multiple reﬂection eﬀects and nonlin-
ear light-induced Freedericksz transition should be taken
into account for developing tunable all-optical switching
devices based on the structure with liquid crystals.

Instead of using a frequency dependent refractive index, we propose to use

the extinction theorem to describe reﬂection and transmission of an ultrashort

pulse passing through the boundary. When the duration of the pulse is

comparable with the relaxation time, the results diﬀer signiﬁcantly from those

given by the traditional method, especially if the carrier frequency is close to

an absorbtion line. We compare the two approaches using the data of GaAs

in the infrared domain. c(cid:13) 2008 Optical Society of America

It is well known that the reﬂection and refraction of an electromagnetic wave on the bound-

ary of a material system is a light scattering phenomenon. The atoms in the medium are

brought into oscillations by the incoming wave, and then secondary waves are generated

by the induced atomic dipoles. The transmitted wave is the result of superposition of the

scattered wave and the external ﬁeld, while the reﬂected wave is a result of backscattering.

One side of the process, the solution of the quantum mechanical equations of motion of the

1

perturbed atoms (or the forced oscillations in the classical model) is treated in most text-

books in order to calculate the frequency dependence of the polarizability and the dielectric

constant. The other side of the problem, the actual scattering process is usually replaced by

phenomenological boundary conditions – Fresnel formulas – for the macroscopic ﬁelds. One

then uses a frequency dependent index of refraction, and calculates the response for each

spectral component.

Instead of that traditional approach which neglects the transient regime of the forced

oscillations, we use a procedure that exhibits the actual physical process. This is the method

of integral equations, known also as the Ewald-Oseen extinction theorem in the stationary

situation.1 We are going to consider here the one-dimensional variant of this theory applied

to ultrafast pulses.

We note that local ﬁeld eﬀects inﬂuence the coupled atom-ﬁeld dynamics, therefore it

can aﬀect the reﬂection and transmission properties too. For weak ﬁelds this leads only to a

constant shift2 of the resonance frequencies, therefore we shall treat the problem here without

this correction.

The extinction theorem has been applied for the resonant nonlinear case in our works2–4

but with the slowly varying amplitude approximation (SVEA) in time. The ﬁrst model

calculation for a linear medium treating the full time development of a pulse without SVEA

has been given by one of us.6

We consider the boundary value problem for the transmission of a light pulse through

a plane-parallel resonant layer consisting of polarizable atoms. Let the incoming ﬁeld be a

linearly polarized plane wave:

Ein(x, t) = E(t − x/c)

(1)

2

We restrict ourselves here to the case of normal incidence. Then the problem is one dimen-

sional in space, thus the macroscopic ﬁeld obeys the inhomogeneous wave equation:

∂x2 −

(2)

In the situation considered here, P is diﬀerent from zero in a slab placed between x = 0 and

x = L, and the solution of Eq.(2) has the form:2

E(x, t) = Ein(x, t) −

(x′, t − |x − x′|/c)dx′.

(3)

Here Ein is the solution of the homogeneous equation corresponding to (2), and it is identiﬁed

with the incoming wave, while the second term is a scattered wave which is the superposition

of outgoing elementary waves originating in diﬀerent x′ planes. Given an incoming wave, the

transmitted wave is determined by the whole solution (3) at x ≥ L, while the reﬂected wave

is described only by the second, integral term at x ≤ 0.

As we are considering the linear case, the dynamics of the polarization P in the medium

can be determined by a ﬁrst order perturbation theory. Supposing that at the beginning the

system is in its ground state, the dipole moment density induced by the ﬁeld is given by the

following expression:

where N is the number density of the dipoles in the medium, dj is the transition dipole matrix

element between the ground state and the j-th excited level, ωj and γj are the corresponding

transition frequencies and decay constants, and E(t, x) is the ﬁeld strength at the position

x of the atomic dipole. In the ordinary theory of dispersion the time dependence of the

electric ﬁeld, E(t) is taken to be E0e−iωt, and after performing the integration in (4) the

3

terms containing e−γt/2 are omitted, as they are rapidly decaying. In this way one obtains

a frequency dependent susceptibility χ(ω) = (1/ε0)Pj(2N|dj|2/¯h)/(ωj − ω − iγj/2), and
refractive index n = (1 + χ(ω))1/2. Our main point is that if the duration of the whole pulse

is shorter than the decay time of the terms which contain e−γj t/2, this traditional approach

fails, and all the terms following from (4) should be kept.

In the case of an optically thin layer, the calculations can be simpliﬁed. Then L/λ ≪ 1,

the spatial variation of the polarization can be neglected, and instead of integrating in Eq.(3)

we can use the mean value of the time derivative of the polarization. In this thin medium case

one can derive a system of coupled diﬀerential equations for the polarization components,

For an arbitrary thick layer one has to solve the coupled integro-diﬀerential equations (3)

and (4), with a numerical method.

We have performed calculations, based on the theory given here and compared the results

with those of the traditional method of Fresnel formulas. For deﬁnitness we have used the

data5 of GaAs in the infrared domain. Two resonant frequencies and the with constants

λ1 = 37.31µm, λ2 = 0.4305µm, γ1 = 0.034ω1, γ2 = 0, (λi = 2πc/ωi), and si :=

,

with s1 = 9.89, s2 = 2.07. reproduced very well the measured5 stationary dispersion and

absorbtion of the material in the range λ = 1 − 102µm. For the sake of simplicity we have

chosen the following form of the incoming pulse Ein(t) = sin2 Ωt cos ω0t, 0 < t < π/Ω. As we

are considering the ultrafast regime we have chosen Ω = 0.25ω0. The shape of this incoming

pulse is shown in Fig. 1(a) below. The solution of Eq.(5) corresponding to this incoming

4

pulse and to the initial conditions Pj(0) = 0,

˙Pj(0) = 0, j = 1, 2 can be given for the thin

layer by an exact but lengthy formula.

Far from resonance (ω0 ≪ ω1, ω0 ≫ ω1) both methods predict the same results. On the

other hand signiﬁcant diﬀerences can be seen for pulses with ω0 ≈ ω1, i.e. close to resonance,

but still in the linear regime. The calculations were performed with ω0 = 1.03ω1, for layers

of diﬀerent thicknesses of the order of the central wavelength, λ0 = 2πc/ω0. Fig. 1 shows the

results obtained for an optically thin layer L = λ0/256. In that case we have solved the system

of equations (5). The numerical solution of Eqs. (3) and (4) are shown in Fig. 2 for a layer

of thickness of λ0. The continuous lines are the results obtained from the present transient

extinction theory, while the dashed lines are the amplitudes obtained by using the frequency

dependent index of refraction. It can be seen, that some of the overall characteristics of

the response obtained by the two diﬀerent methods are similar. Both treatments predict

signiﬁcant broadening of the reﬂected and transmitted pulses, since the decay time, 2/γ is

long compared with the duration of the excitation. In addition, till the end of the exciting

pulse, ω0t = 4π, the reﬂected amplitudes are very similar except for a little phase shift.

The transmitted pulse appears in both cases with the same expected delay that can be

calculated as tg = vg/L, where vg is the the group velocity.7, 8 This gives ω0tg = 7.96π in

good agreement with the numerical result. We note, in addition, that both methods yielded

precursors7, 8 in the transmitted ﬁelds appearing at t = L/c, not seen in the ﬁgures, because

of their smallness.

In the case of the thin layer the forms of the ﬁelds are quite similar, see Fig 1. On the

other hand signiﬁcant diﬀerences are seen in the time dependences of the transmitted and

reﬂected pulses calculated by the two diﬀerent treatments in layers of thickness comparable

5

with λ0. We attribute these diﬀerences in the amplitudes, as well as in the phases to the

approximative character of the time dependence of the polarization in the Fourier method,

i.e. to the omission of the transients at the beginning and at the end of the excitation.

This part is non-negligible if the duration of the process is comparable with the relaxation

time since it represents an important contribution to the elementary waves generated by the

induced dipoles.

In conclusion, we ﬁnd that for ultrafast pulses the properties of a dispersive medium

must be calculated by taking care of the transient response of the system. This can be done

best by using a fully time dependent treatment as proposed in the present work.

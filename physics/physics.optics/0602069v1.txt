Optical vortex trajectories in an astigmatic and elliptical
Gaussian beam

ABSTRACT

An optical vortex, produced at one point in an optical beam, would propagate through an optical system to
another point where the vortex can be used for some purpose. However, asymmetrical optical elements in such
a system can cause astigmatism or at least distroy the rotational symmetry of the beam, which may aﬀect the
propagation of the vortex in an undesirable way. While an optical vortex in a rotationally symmetric, stigmatic
Gaussian beam retains its initial morphology for as far as it propagates, the morphology of an optical vortex
in an asymmetric or astigmatic Gaussian beam changes. The vortex can even be replaced by another with the
opposite topological charge. We consider the behavior of single noncanonical vortices propagating in Gaussian
beams that are asymmetric and/or astigmatic. General expressions for the vortex trajectories are provided. The
locations of the ﬂip planes and the evolution of the anisotropy of the vortex are considered for diﬀerent non-ideal
situations.

Keywords: Singular optics, optical vortices, astigmatic Gaussian beams, optical vortex morphology, topological
charge

1. INTRODUCTION

One of the signiﬁcant advances that is being made in nano-technology is the ability to manipulate small objects
and particles, even to the level of single atoms. A highly focused optical beam can be used as an ‘optical tweezer’
with which single atoms can be moved around. On an even more sophisticated level, optical beams can also be
used to rotate or twist small particles. In the early 90’s Allen and coworkers discovered that an optical beam
can carry orbital angular momentum1 (in addition to spin angular mometum, which is associated with circular
polarization). This angular momentum can be transferred to a small particle that absorbs the light.

Optical orbital angular momentum is associated with phase singularities, called optical vortices, which were
discovered by Nye and Berry in the 60’s.2 An optical vortex is a point on the cross section of a beam (or a
curved line moving along the beam). At this point the intensity of the beam is zero. Around this point the phase
increases by an integer multiple of 2π. This integer is called the topological charge of the vortex. Most of the
time vortices only appear with topological charges of
1. The two signs represent two opposite helicities, which
±
indicate whether the phase increases in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction around the phase singularity.

The rate of increase of the phase around a vortex is not always a constant function of the azimuthal angle.
For a canonical vortex the rate of increase is constant and the vortex has an isotropic (rotationally symmetric)
appearance. One can regard a noncanonical vortex as the anisotropically scaled (or stretched) version of a
canonical vortex. Together with the direction or orientation of the scaling, the amount of anisotropy represents
the morphology of the optical vortex.

One can create an optical vortex in a beam with a computer generated hologram.3 This vortex then propagates
along the beam to the point where it can be applied to rotate some small objects.4 Unfortunately, the vortex
does not always remain the same as it propagates. If there are more than one vortex in the beam they interact
with each other and can even annihilate each other.5 Moreover, in the late 90’s a group in spain6 performed
an interesting experiment in which they demonstrated that the topological charge of an optical vortex can be
inverted after the vortex bearing beam passed through a cylindrical lens. Hence, under certain circumstances,

even if there is only one vortex in the beam, it can change its shape (morphology) and even its topological
charge. So the topological charge in a beam is not always conserved during propagation. What happens is that
two ‘vortices’ are brought in from inﬁnity by means of an edge phase dislocation to cancel the vortex in the beam
and replace it with a vortex of opposite topological charge. This happens because of the astigmatism that the
beam picked up from the cylindrical lens. The topological charge is still locally conserved in that the net inward
(or outward) ﬂow of topological charge through a closed surface is always zero.

One of the consequences of this observation is that there is a set of special planes in such an astigmatic beam
where the topological charge is inverted.7 One of the questions one can ask is where these planes are located
and what these locations depend on. Here we report on the results of this investigation. It is well known that
a single noncanonical vortex that propagates in a rotationally symmetric, stigmatic Gaussian beam retains its
morphology for as far as it propagates.8 When the rotational symmetry is broken or the beam picked up some
astigmatism this situation is no longer true – the morphology of the vortex evolves during propagation. If the
Gaussian beam is asymmetrical (elliptical) but not astigmatic and the vortex is canonical in the waist of the
Gaussian beam, then, although the vortex becomes noncanonical, it does not change its topological charge. If it
is noncanonical in the waist, there can be a region over which the topological charge of the vortex is inverted. A
more detail analysis of these conditions is provided below. If the beam is astigmatic but symmetric in the sense
that the Rayleigh distances associated with the two transverse directions are equal, then the vortex can invert
its topological charge irrespective of its initial morphology. Hence it is both the morphology of the vortex and
the astigmatism of the beam that determines whether topological charge inversion occurs.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We deﬁne our notation for the beam and the morphology of the
vortex in Section 2. The general expressions for the trajectory of a single vortex with an arbitrary morphology
propagating in a general asymmetrical and/or astigmatic Gaussian beam are provided in Section 3. The zeros
of the denominator of these trajectories provide the locations for the ﬂip planes. In Section 4 these ﬂip plane
locations are investigated for various situations. We provide expressions for the anisotropy of the vortex as a
function of the propagation distance in Section 5 to show that the anisotropy vanishes and changes sign at the
locations of the ﬂip planes, which conﬁrms that topological charges inversion occurs at the ﬂip plane locations.
Conclusions are provided in Section 6.

2. NOTATION

A vortex bearing Gaussian beam can be expressed as a product of a complex valued polynomial function (i.e. the
prefactor) and a Gaussian function. We’ll deﬁne the propagation direction as the z-direction and the transverse
directions as the x- and y-directions. Here, we’ll use normalized coordinates u = x/ω0, v = y/ω0 and t = z/ρ,
where ω0 and ρ represent the waist size and the associated Rayleigh range of the Gaussian beam, respectively.

An astigmatic Gaussian beam has two diﬀerent waists (foci) for two orthogonal transverse directions, which we
deﬁne as the x- and y-directions, respectively. We deﬁne a central plane as the plane that is exactly halfway
between the two focal planes of the astigmatic beam. For a stigmatic beam the central plane coincides with
the waist of the Gaussian beam. One can then quantify the amount of astigmatism by a parameter τ , which is
deﬁned as the distance from the central plane to one of the focal planes, normalized with respect to the nominal
Rayleigh range (deﬁned below). Note that τ is a dimensionless parameters that is given as the ratio of the two
most signiﬁcant scale parameters in the beam.

A Gaussian beam can be asymmetric in the sense that the size of the beam waist may be diﬀerent for the x- and y-
directions, respectively. In this case we deﬁne, for the purpose of normalization, a nominal waist size ω0 = √ωxωy,
where ωx and ωy are the waist sizes in the x- and y-directions, respectively. The associated nominal Rayleigh
range is then ρ = √ρxρy. We quantify the asymmetry of the beam by a parameter γ = ωx/ωy =
ρx/ρy. For
ωy. For γ = 1 the beam is called symmetric (which is not to be
deﬁniteness we’ll assume that γ

of cos ψ represents the topological charge of the vortex. For an oﬀ-axis vortex the expression in Eq. (1) can be
shifted to an arbitrary location (u0, v0).

Hence, in its central plane a general asymmetric astigmatic Gaussian beam with a single oﬀ-axis noncanonical

The prefactor changes as a function of t. The zeros of the prefactor give the locations of the vortex as a function
of the propagation distance – the vortex trajectories. For a general asymmetric astigmatic Gaussian beam with

4. FLIP PLANE LOCATIONS

The values of t for which the denominator of the trajectory functions, given in Eqs. (5–7), become zero represent
points along the propagation direction where the vortices move to transverse inﬁnity. As we’ll show below the
topological charges are inverted in the planes at these locations. These planes are therefore called ﬂip planes.
Since the denominator is quadratic in t there are in general two such planes in a beam. The existence of these
planes in astigmatic Gaussian beams is in itself an interesing fact, because they do not in general coincide with
any of the other special planes in the beam, such as the focal planes.

Note that the denominator in Eqs. (5) and (6) is independent of the coordinates of the vortex in the central
plane, (u0, v0).
It only depends on the astigmatism parameter τ , the symmetry parameter γ and the initial
morphology of the vortex.

We now consider the locations of the ﬂip planes under two special circumstances: for elliptical stigmatic beams
(τ = 0) and for symmetric astigmatic beams (γ = 1).

4.1. Elliptical stigmatic beams

First we consider the location of the ﬂip planes in an elliptical stigmatic beam and thus set τ = 0 in the
denominator of the trajectory functions. The locations of the ﬂip planes are then given by

The locations of the ﬂip planes as a function of K are shown in Fig. 1. One can see that the ﬂip planes are
always located on the same side of the central plane. In the extreme case (K

which implies that a certain amount of anisotropy is required for the vortex in the initial plane to produce
ﬂip planes. A canonical vortex in the waist cannot undergo topological charge inversion in a stigmatic beam.
Moreover, if the beam is symmetric (γ = 1) in addition to being stigmatic (τ = 0) – in other words, the beam is
rotationally symmetric – then a ﬁnite amount of anisotropy cannot satisfy the requirement of Eq. (11).

4.2. Symmetric astigmatic beams

Now we consider the location of the ﬂip planes in a symmetric astigmatic beam for which we set γ = 1 in the
denominator of the trajectory functions. In this case the locations of the ﬂip planes are given by

with T given in Eq. (10). We see that the ﬂip planes only exist when

The signiﬁcance of the existence of the ﬂip planes lies in the fact that the vortices change their topological charge
in those planes. One can show this by computing the anisotropy of the vortex as a function of the propagation

In the central plane the anisotropy is given by cos ψ0. From the fact that the numerator of the anisotropy
function in Eq. (18) is proportional to the denominator of the trajectories, provided in Eqs. (5) and (6), one can
conclude that the anisotropy becomes zero. The topological charge is given by the sign of the anisotropy. One
can therefore see that the topological charge changes sign at the ﬂip planes.

Next the anisotropy is considered for elliptical stigmatic beams and for symmetric astigmatic beams.

Apart from the sign in front of it, the right-hand expression in Eq. (20) is positive, which means that there are
no ﬂip planes. It therefore requires a non-canonical vortex in the central plane to produce ﬂip planes. To ﬁnd
the minimum required morphology, one can consider where the numerator of Eq. (19) becomes zero and ﬁnd the
same requirement given in Eq. (11).

In Fig. 3 we show the evolution of the anisotropy for a beam with τ = 0 and γ = 4 and a vortex with morphology
given by ψ0 = φ0 = π/4. One can see that there is a range of propagation distances on one side of the central
plane for which the anisotropy is negative, hence, where the topological charge of the vortex is inverted. We also
see that the maximum anisotropy is achieved in a plane diﬀerent from the central plane.

6. CONCLUSIONS

We investigated the properties of the planes in astigmatic and/or elliptical beams where the topological charge
of optical vortices are inverted. On the one hand, these ﬂip planes are obtained as the zeros of the denominator
of the trajectory equations. On the other hand, they are given as the zeros in the anisotropy of the vortex as a
function of the propagation distance. Two special cases are considered: elliptical stigmatic beams and symmetric
astigmatic beams. For the ﬁrst case ﬂip planes only exist if the vortex is suﬃciently anisotropic in the waist
(central plane) of the beam. In the second case ﬂip planes exists even for vortices that are canonical in the
central plane, provided that the beam is suﬃciently astigmatic.

The behavior of vortices and in particular the location of the ﬂip planes in astigmatic and/or elliptical beams
can thus be predicted. This provides important information for the design of optical systems in the application
of optical vortices.

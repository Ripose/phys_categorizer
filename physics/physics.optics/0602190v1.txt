Enhanced Transmission of Light and Matter through Nanoapertures without
Assistance of Surface Waves

Subwavelength aperture arrays in thin metal ﬁlms enable enhanced transmission of light and
matter waves [for example, see T.W. Ebbesen et al., Nature (London) 391, 667 (1998) and E. Moreno
et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 170406 (2005)]. The phenomenon relies on resonant excitation of the
surface electron or matter waves. We show another mechanism that provides a great transmission
enhancement not by coupling to the surface waves but by the interference of diﬀracted evanescent
waves in the far-ﬁeld zone. Veriﬁcation of the mechanism is presented by comparison with recently
published data.

The scattering of waves by apertures is one of the ba-
sic phenomena in the wave physics. The most remarkable
feature of the light scattering by subwavelength apertures
in a metal screen is enhancement of the light by excitation
of electron waves in the metal. Since the observation of
enhanced transmission of light through a 2D array of sub-
wavelength metal nanoholes [1], the phenomenon attracts
increasing interest of researchers because of its poten-
tial for applications in nanooptics and nanophotonics [2].
Recently, the enhanced transmission through subwave-
length apertures was predicted also for matter waves [3].
The enhancement of light is a process that can include
resonant excitation and interference of surface plasmons
[3, 4, 5, 6], Fabry-Perot-like intraslit modes [7, 8, 9, 10],
and evanescent electromagnetic waves at the metal sur-
face [11]. In the case of thin screens whose thickness are
too small to support the intraslit resonance, the extraor-
dinary transmission is caused by the excitation of surface
plasmons or their matter-wave analog, surface matter
waves [3, 4, 5, 6]. In this Letter, we show another mech-
anism that provides a great transmission enhancement
not by coupling to the surface electron or matter waves
but by the interference of diﬀracted evanescent waves in
the far-ﬁeld zone.

The transmission enhancement without assistant of
surface waves can be explained in terms of the follow-
ing theoretical formulation. We ﬁrst consider the trans-
mission of light through a structure that is similar but
simpler than an array of holes, namely an array of par-
allel subwavelength slits. The structure consists from a
thin metal screen with the slits separated by many wave-
length. To exclude the plasmons from our model, the
metal is considered to be a perfect conductor. Such a
metal is described by a classis Drude model for which
the plasmon frequency tends towards inﬁnity. Owing to
the great distance between the slits, the electromagnetic
ﬁeld at one slit is assumed to be independent from other
slits. The transmission of the slit array is determined
by calculating the light power in the far-ﬁeld diﬀraction
zone. The waves diﬀracted by each of the independent

slits are found by using the Neerhof and Mur approach,
which uses a Green’s function formalism for a rigorous
numerical solution of Maxwell’s equations for a single,
isolated slit [12, 13, 14]. The calculations show a big, up
to 5 times, resonant transmission enhancement near to
the Fabry-Perot wavelengths determined by an array pe-
riod. To clarify the numerical result, we then present an
intuitively transparent analytical model, which quantita-
tively explains the resonant enhancement in terms of the
far-ﬁeld-zone interference of the evanescent waves pro-
duced by the independent slits. The model predicts the
∼5-times (resonant) and ∼1000-times (nonresonant) en-
hancements for both the light and matter waves passing
through a perforated metallic or dielectric screen, inde-
pendently on the apertures shape. Veriﬁcation of the
analytical formulae by comparison with data published
in the literature supports these predictions. The Wood
anomalies in transmission spectra of optical gratings, a
long standing problem in optics [15], follow naturally
from interference properties of the model.

Let us ﬁrst investigate the light transmission by using
the rigorous model. The model considers an array of M
independent slits of width 2a and period Λ in a screen
of thickness b ≪ λ. The screen placed in vacuum is illu-
minated by a normally incident TM-polarized wave with
wavelength λ = 2πc/ω = 2π/k. The magnetic ﬁeld of the
wave ~H(x, y, z, t) = U (x)exp(−i(kz + ωt))~ey is assumed
to be time harmonic and constant in the y direction. The
transmission of the slit array is determined by calculat-
ing all the light power P (λ) radiated into the far-ﬁeld
diﬀraction zone, x∈[−∞, ∞] at the distance z ≫ λ from
the screen. The total per-slit transmission coeﬃcient,
which represents the per-slit enhancement in transmis-
sion achieved by taking a single, isolated slit and placing
it in an M -slit array, is then found by using an equation
TM (λ) = P (λ)/M P1, where P1 is the power radiated by
a single slit. Figure 1 shows the transmission coeﬃcient
TM (λ), in the spectral region 500-2000 nm, calculated for
the array parameters: a = 100 nm, Λ = 1800 nm, and
2b = 10−2λmax. The transmitted power was computed

ment mechanism, we have developed an analytical model,
which yields simple formulae for the diﬀracted ﬁelds. For
the ﬁelds diﬀracted by a narrow (2a ≪ λ, b ≥ 0) slit into
the region |z| > 2a, it can be shown that the Neerhof and
Mur model simpliﬁes to an analytical one. For the mag-
netic ~H = (0, Hy, 0) and electric ~E = (Ex, 0, Ez) ﬁelds
we found:

functions, respectively. The ﬁelds are spatially nonuni-
form, in contrast to a common opinion that a subwave-
length aperture diﬀracts light in all directions uniformly
[16]. The ﬁelds produced by an array of M independent
slits are given by ~E(x, z) = P
m=1 ~Em(x + mΛ, z) and
~H(x, z) = P
m=1 ~Hm(x + mΛ, z), where ~Em and ~Hm are
the ﬁelds of an m-th beam generated by the respective
slit. As an example, Fig. 2(a) compares the far-ﬁeld dis-
tributions calculated by the analytical formulae (1-5) to
that obtained by the rigorous model. We notice that the
distributions are undistinguishable. Thus, the analytical
model not only supports results of our rigorous model,
but presents an intuitively transparent explanation of the
enhancement in terms of the interference of the ﬁelds
produced by the multi-beam source. The array-induced
decrease of the central beam divergence (Figs. 2(b) and
2(c)) is relevant to the beaming light [17], and the non-
diﬀractive light and matter waves [18].

The analytical model accurately describes the ﬁelds ~E
and ~H, but what about the transmission coeﬃcient. The
ﬁeld power P , which determines the coeﬃcient TM , is
found by integrating the energy ﬂux |~S| = | ~E × ~H ∗ +
~E∗ × ~H|. Thus, the model accurately predicts also the
light transmission. We now consider the predictions in
light of the key observations published in the literature
for the two fundamental systems of wave optics, the
single-slit and two-slit systems. The major features of
a single-slit system are the intraslit resonances and the
spectral shifts of the resonances from the Fabry-Perot
wavelengths [8]. In agreement with the predictions [8],
the formula (4) shows that the transmission T = P/P0 =

1 mm over the detector region of width ∆x = 20 mm.
The transmission spectra TM (λ) is shown for diﬀerent
values of M . We notice that the spectra TM (λ) is peri-
odically modulated, as a function of wavelength, below
and above a level deﬁned by the transmission T1(λ) = 1
of one isolated slit. As M is increased from 2 to 10,
the visibility of the modulation fringes increases approxi-
mately from 0.2 to 0.7. The transmission TM exhibits the
Fabry-Perot like maxima around wavelengths λn = Λ/n.
The spectral peaks increase with increasing the number
of slits and reach a saturation (T max
M ≈ 5) in amplitude
by M = 300, at λ ≈ 1800 nm. The peaks widths and the
spectral shifts of the resonances from the Fabry-Perot
wavelengths decrease with increasing the number M of
slits. From the data of Fig. 1, one can understand that
enhancement and suppression in the transmission spectra
are the natural properties of an ensemble of independent
subwavelength slits in a thin (b ≪ λ) screen. The spec-
tral peaks are characterized by asymmetric Fano-like pro-
ﬁles. Such modulations in the transmission spectra are
known as Wood’s anomaly. The minima and maxima
correspond to Rayleigh anomalies and Fano resonances,
respectively [15]. The weak Wood’s anomalies are present
also in the case of a M = 2, a classical Young type two-
slit system.

The above-presented data is based on calculation of the
energy ﬂux by using the electromagnetic ﬁeld evaluated
numerically. The transmission enhancement is achieved
by taking a single, isolated slit and placing it in an ar-
ray. The interference of the waves diﬀracted by the inde-
pendent slits can be considered as a physical mechanism
responsible for the enhancement. To clarify the numer-
ical results and gain physical insight into the enhance-

spectral shifts are explained by the wavelength depen-
dent terms in the denominator of Eq. (4). The enhance-
ment (T (λ1)≈b/πa [18]) is in contrast to the attenuation
predicted by the model [8]. The Young type two-slit con-
ﬁguration is characterized by a sinusoidal modulation of
the transmission spectra T2(λ) [19, 20]. The modulation

In order to gain physical insight into the mechanism
of plasmonless enhancement in a multi-slit (M ≥2) sys-
tem, we now consider dependence of the transmission
TM (λ) on the slit separation Λ. We assume that the
slits are independent also at Λ → 0. According to the
Van Citter-Zernike coherence theorem, a light source
(even incoherent) of radius r = M (a + Λ) produces a
transversally coherent wave at the distance z≤πRr/λ in
the region of radius R. Thus, in the case of Λ ≪ λ,
the collective emission of the ensemble of slits gener-
ates the coherent electric and magnetic ﬁelds, ~E =
m=1 ~Emexp(iϕm)≈M ~E1exp(iϕ) and ~H≈M ~H1exp(iϕ).
P
Consequently, the maximum power of the emitted light
scales with the square of the number of slits (beams),
P ∼ M 2. The transmission (TM ∼P/M ), however, grows
linearly with the number of slits, TM ∼M . For a given
M , the function TM (λ) monotonically varies with λ.
Such an enhancement regime (ﬁrst regime) is shown in
Fig. 4. At appropriate conditions, the transmission can
reach 1000-times enhancement (M = λz/πR(a + Λ)).
The transmission enhancement in the second regime does
not require close proximity of the slits.
In the case of
2R ≥ 2λz/πr (Λ≥λ), the beams arrive at the detector
with diﬀerent phases ϕm. Consequently, the power and
transmission grow slowly with the number of slits (Figs.
1-4). According to our model, the transmission TM ex-

hibits the Fabry-Perot like maxima around wavelengths
λn = Λ/n. The constructive and destructive interfer-
ence of the beams leads respectively to the enhancement
and suppression of the transmission amplitudes as in a
classical heterodyne system.

The analytical model gives not only intuitively trans-
parent explanation of the plasmonless transmission en-
hancement, but in contrast to the previous studies, pre-
dicts the enhancement for the matter waves. Indeed, in
our model, the enhancement is based on coherent excita-
tion of an assemble of slits and constructive interference
of the diﬀracted waves. The constructive interference is
provided not by coupling between the slits, but by a geo-
metrically well-deﬁned phase relationship between wave
amplitudes at diﬀerent lateral locations in the far-ﬁeld
zone. Thus, the enhancement mechanism depends nei-
ther on the nature (light or matter) of ﬁelds ψm nor on
material and shape of the apertures. For instance, in
the ﬁrst enhancement regime, the ﬁxed phase correlation
leads to the M -times enhancement of the ﬁeld ampli-
M
m=1 ψmexp(iϕm)≈M ψ1exp(iϕ), and conse-
tude, ψ = P
quently to the M -time transmission enhancement. Due
to Babinet’s principle, the model predicts the enhance-
ment also in the backward scattering (reﬂection) spectra.
Notice that amplitudes of ﬁelds ψm rapidly decrease with
increasing the distances x, y and z. However, due to the
enhancement (Figs. 1-4) and beaming (Fig. 2) mecha-
nisms, an array produces a nonevanescent (propagating)
wave ψ with low angle divergence. Such a behavior is
in agreement with the Huygens-Fresnel principle, which
considers a propagating wave as a superposition of sec-
ondary spherical waves.

It worth to note that the presented model is similar
in spirit to the dynamical Bloch-waves diﬀraction model
[21], the Airy-like model based on the Rayleigh ﬁeld ex-
pansion [22], and especially to a diﬀracted evanescent
wave model recently challenged in Ref.
[11]. The dif-
ference arises from a fact that the models [21, 22] con-
sider the case of M = ∞, while predictions of our model
strongly depend on the number M 6= ∞ of slits. In ad-
dition, our model deals with independent slits, while the
models of Refs. [11, 21, 22] consider the slits electromag-
netically coupled via the periodic boundary conditions.
There is an evident resemblance also between our model
and a Dicke superradiance model [23] of collective emis-
sion of an ensemble of atoms. A quantum reformulation
of our model can help us to understand why a quan-
tum entangled state of photons is preserved on passage
through a hole array [24]. Notice, in this connection,
that the surface waves can couple the radiation phases
of the diﬀerent slits, so that they get synchronized, and
a collective emission can release the stored energy as an
enhanced radiation. This kind of enhancement is of dif-
ferent nature compared to our model. The model does

4

not require coupling between the slits and does not con-
tains surface waves (Ex → 0 at z → 0).

In conclusion, a rigorous model based on a Green’s
function formalism and an analytical model were pro-
posed for description of the transmission of light through
an array of independent slits. Using the analytical model
we showed a physical mechanism that provides a big
transmission enhancement of light or matter waves not
by coupling to the surface waves but by the interference
of diﬀracted evanescent waves in the far-ﬁeld zone. The
veriﬁcation of the analytical formulae by comparison with
data published in the literature supports the predictions.
The Wood anomalies in transmission spectra of optical
gratings, a long standing problem in optics, follows nat-
urally from interference properties of the model. The an-
alytical formulae can be useful for experimentalists who
develop nanodevices based on transmission and beaming
of light or matter by subwavelengths apertures.

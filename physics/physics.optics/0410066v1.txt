A General Method for the Determination of
Matrix Coefﬁcients for High Order Optical

The non-linear transformations incurred by the rays in an optical system can be suit-
ably described by matrices to any desired order of approximation. In systems composed
of uniform refractive index elements, each individual ray refraction or translation has an
associated matrix and a succession of transformations correspond to the product of the re-
spective matrices. This paper describes a general method to ﬁnd the matrix coefﬁcients for
translation and surface refraction irrespective of the surface shape or the order of approxi-
mation. The choice of coordinates is unusual as the orientation of the ray is characterised
by the direction cosines, rather than slopes; this is shown to greatly simplify and generalise
coefﬁcient calculation. Two examples are shown in order to demonstrate the power of the
method: The ﬁrst is the determination of seventh order coefﬁcients for spherical surfaces
and the second is the determination of third order coefﬁcients for a toroidal surface.

1 Introduction

4 matrices,
An optical system can be effectively modelled in paraxial approximation by a product of 4
each representing one elementary transformation of the light rays [1]; the elementary transformations
are either translations of the ray in homogeneous media or the effects of surfaces separating different
media. A more accurate approach implies the consideration of higher order terms but the fact that
Snell’s law makes use of the sine function rules out the terms of even order; as a consequence, when
one wants to improve on the paraxial approximation, one has to consider third order terms.

×

Aberrations have already been studied extensively [2, 3] but work is still going on in order to design
symbolic models of optical systems that computers can use for optimisation purposes and humans can
look at to gain a better understanding of systems’ performance.

1

The matrix theory has been extended to deal with higher order terms [4] through the use of a vector
basis that incorporates two position and two orientation coordinates as well as all their third or higher
order monomials, increasing the overall dimension which becomes 24 for third order approximation.
It is possible to apply axis symmetry to reduce the matrix dimension through the use of complex
coordinates and their higher order monomials; for instance, in third order the matrices to be considered
for axis-symmetric systems are 8

8 [4, 5].

The set of four coordinates normally used to describe the ray consists of the two rectangular coordi-
nates, x and y along with the two ray slopes u = dx/dz and v = dy/dz. I chose to replace the ray
slopes with the direction cosines relative to the coordinate axes, respectively s and t, in order to allow
an easier and more elegant formulation of the Snell’s law at a surface but at the expense of rendering
the translation transformation non-linear.

×

This work details a general method that can be used to establish all the coefﬁcients needed for any
order modelling of optical systems built with surfaces of unspeciﬁed shape. The power of the method
is exempliﬁed with determination of matrix coefﬁcients for spherical systems in seventh order and for
a toroidal surface in third order.

2 The choice of coordinates

The optical axis is assumed to lie along the z axis, so the position of any point is determined by the two
coordinates x and y; when dealing with axis symmetric systems, the two coordinates can be combined
in the complex coordinate X = x + iy. The ray orientation is deﬁned by cosines of the angles with the
x and y axes, respectively s and t; again a complex orientation coordinate can be used, S = s + it, in
order to simplify the rotational treatment of axis symmetric systems.

Using the same notation of reference [4], x& is the vector whose components are the coordinates

and their monomials up to order n:

x& =

,

(1)

where total order j + k + l + m is n or less and odd, with all exponents greater than zero. By convention
the vector elements are placed in the order of smaller n and larger four digit number jklm.

Any transformation of x& into x′& can be represented by a square matrix S of dimension N equal

to the size of x&, following the equation:

x′

& = Sx& .

The matrix S has the following structure:

S =

P4×4

H4×(N−4)

(cid:18)

0(N−4)×4 E(N−4)×(N−4) (cid:19)

.

(3)

−

The four submatrices that form S have the following meaning: P4×4 contains the paraxial constants
of the optical system, H4×(N−4) has 4(N
4) high order coefﬁcients from the series expansion of the
transformed coordinates, 0(N−4)×4 is composed of zeroes and ﬁnally E(N−4)×(N−4) is obtained from
the elements of the ﬁrst four lines by a procedure called extension whereby the elements of lines 5 to
N from x′& are calculated and all terms of orders higher than n are dropped. More speciﬁcally, if we
wish to determine the coefﬁcients for the line corresponding to the monomial xjyksltm, we take the
polynomial expressions for x, y, s and t from lines 1 to 4 and raise them to the powers j, k, l and m,
respectively, making their product afterwards; the result is a polynomial of degree n
(j + k + l + m)
from which only the terms of orders up to n should be considered. The submatrix E(N−4)×(N−4) can
itself be subdivided into components of different orders and components with all zero elements.

×

Although the ray transformation is described by an N

N matrix, the above considerations show
that only the 4(N
4) elements from the ﬁrst four lines need be considered, as the extension procedure
is standard for all transformations. In cases where symmetry exists the number of independent coefﬁ-
cients can be greatly reduced [4, 6]. It is apparent that the matrix for any given transformation can be
considered completely deﬁned when the ﬁrst four lines’ coefﬁcients have been evaluated, i.e. when the
transformed coordinates have been expressed in a power series of order n.

−

×

The coordinate conventions made above are not the same as those made in references [4, 5] and
indeed by the majority of authors; they may appear to be a poorer choice because, as we shall see, they
lead to a non-linear translation transformation; on the other hand they will simplify the determination
of refraction coefﬁcients.
It should be noted, however, that a coordinate change can be seen as a
transformation, itself governed by a matrix; it is not difﬁcult to follow the procedure outlined below
and then change from cosines into slopes, if needed.

3 The elementary transformations

3.1 The translation matrix

The ﬁrst elementary transformation that has to be considered is just the translation of the ray in an
homogeneous medium; the orientation coordinates don’t change but the position coordinates change
according to the equations

The previous equations give directly the coefﬁcients for lines 1 and 2 of the matrix T which describes
the translation transformation; lines 3 and 4 are made up of zeroes, except for the diagonal elements
which are 1; this translates the two relations s′ = s and t′ = t. The lines 5 to N can be obtained by the
extension procedure described before.

If slopes were used instead of direction cosines the translation matrix would have a much simpler

form, corresponding to a linear transformation [4].

3.2 Refraction formulae

It is useful to
The inﬂuence of the surface power on the ray coordinates must now be considered.
analyse separately the changes on the ray orientation and the modiﬁcation of the position coordinates.
The ray orientation changes due to the application of Snell’s law when the ray encounters the surface
of separation between the two media; let this surface be deﬁned by the general formula:

Let a ray impinge on the surface on a point of coordinates x and y with direction cosines s and t.

The normal to the surface at the incidence point is the vector:

the direction of the incident ray is the unit vector:

and the refracted ray has a direction which is represented by the vector:

where s′ and t′ are the direction cosines after refraction.

One can apply Snell’s law by equating the cross products of the ray directions with the normal on

both sides of the surface multiplied by the respective refractive indices:

where ν represents the refractive index ratio of the two media.

The algebraic solutions of the equation above can be found for many surfaces by means of suitable
symbolic processing software like Mathematica; in certain cases the solution is easier to ﬁnd after a
suitable change of coordinates along the z axis, which will not affect the ﬁnal result; for instance, for
a spherical surface it is convenient to shift the coordinate origin to the center.
In order to ﬁnd the
coefﬁcients for the matrix R1, representing the change in the ray orientation, the explicit expressions
for s′ and t′ must be expanded in series; this can again be programmed into Mathematica. The examples
given later show this procedure for two different surfaces.

3.3 Surface offset

The use of just two position coordinates implies that these are referenced to a plane normal to the
axis. When a ray is refracted at a surface, the position coordinates that apply are those of the incidence
point; nevertheless the translation to the surface is referenced to the vertex plane and thus the position
coordinates that come out of the translation transformation, are those of the intersection with that plane;
the difference between the two positions is named surface offset.

Figure 1: The ray intersects the surface at a point X1 which is different both from the point of inter-
section of the incident ray with the plane of the vertex, X, and the point of intersection of
the refracted ray with the same plane, X2. The surface is responsible for three successive
transformations: 1 - an offset from X to X1, 2 - the refraction and 3 - the offset from X1 to
X2.

The ﬁgure 1 illustrates the problem that must be solved: The reference plane for the position coor-
dinates of the ray in a refraction process is the plane of the surface vertex; the coordinates of the point
of intersection of the ray with this plane are not the same before and after the refraction. The surface
matrix must account not only for the orientation changes but also for the position offset introduced by
the refraction process.

If the origin of the rectangular coordinates is located at the vertex and (x, y, 0) are the coordinates
of the ray when it crosses the plane of the vertex, the current coordinates of a point on the incident ray

As the intersection point has to verify both (11) and (6) it is possible to solve a system of three
simultaneous equations to determine its coordinates. In fact there may be several intersection points,
as the ray may intercept a complex surface in several points; it is not difﬁcult, however, to select
the solution of interest by careful examination of the surface region that has been hit; we are usually
interested in the solution that has the smallest

value.
As before a series expansion of the exact expressions of x′ and y′ must be performed taking only
the terms up to the nth order; this will yield the coefﬁcients for the matrix T1 which describes the
transformation from point X to point X1 and will be called the forward offset.

z′
|

|

The offset from point X1 to point X2, designated backward offset, is the reverse transformation of
the forward offset, for a ray whose direction coordinates have been modiﬁed by refraction. We solve
(11) and (6) in terms of x and y and apply the previous procedure to determine the coefﬁcients of the
transformation matrix, T2.

The matrix describing the transformations imposed by the surface is the product T2R1T1, as the
ray has to suffer the three successive transformations: forward offset, refraction and backward offset.
The surface matrix is called R.

4 Stop effects

The entrance pupil of the optical system plays an important role in the overall aberrations; the center of
the pupil deﬁnes the chief ray, which determines the paraxial image point. The ray fan usually extends
equally in all directions around the chief ray and the points of intersection of the various rays in the
fan with the image plane determine the ray aberrations. When matrices are used to model the system
the image appears described in terms of the position and orientation coordinates of the rays when these
are subjected to the ﬁrst transformation, be it a refraction or a translation; in terms of ray aberrations
this corresponds to a situation where the object is located at inﬁnity and the entrance pupil is placed
where the ﬁrst transformation takes place. In fact, the orientation coordinates play the role of object
coordinates and the position coordinates are the actual pupil coordinates, if this coincides with the ﬁrst
transformation; the chief ray can be found easily just by zeroing the position coordinate.

Ray aberrations can be evaluated correctly if the image is described in terms of both object and stop
coordinates or some appropriate substitutes; an object point is then set by the object coordinates, the
paraxial image point is found when the stop coordinate is zero and the aberrations are described by the
differences to this point. This can be done adequately when the stop is located before the ﬁrst surface
and so coincides with the entrance pupil. If the object is at inﬁnity the problem is very easy to solve and
application examples have already been described [6]. If the entrance pupil is located at the position zs
zs prior to hitting it;
relative to the ﬁrst surface, this means that the rays must perform a translation of
this can be accommodated via the right product by a translation matrix T−zs, where the index indicates
the amount of translation.

−

The case of near objects is more difﬁcult to deal with because we are faced with a dilemma: If a
translation from the pupil position to the ﬁrst surface is applied the position coordinates of the incident
rays become pupil coordinates but the rays’ origins on the object are lost. Conversely we can apply a

stop effects.

translation from the object position, ending up with the reverse problem of knowing the rays’ origins
and ignoring their point of passage through the pupil. We need the position coordinates both at the
object and pupil location; this suggests that the ray’s orientation should be speciﬁed not by its direction
cosines but by the coordinates of the point of passage through the pupil. In ﬁgure 2 a ray leaves an object
point of coordinates (x, y) and crosses the entrance pupil plane at a point of coordinates (xp, yp); then
the direction cosines, s and t can be calculated by:

where zp is the position of the pupil relative to the object.

The matrix theory developed before was based on direction cosines rather than pupil coordinates; in
consequence a coordinate change is needed before the translation from the object to the ﬁrst surface is
applied to the rays. Rather than use equations (12) it is more convenient to look at them as a coordi-
nate change governed by a matrix Tp; for the determination of its coefﬁcients we apply the standard
procedure of series expansion. The following is the result for 7th order:

at the object position; as a symmetrical conversion is not performed when the rays leave the system,
there is no place for the use of matrix T−1

p , as would be the case in a similarity transformation.

A case study would involve the following successive steps:

Determine the matrices for all the translation and refraction transformations suffered by the ray
from the object point to the image plane.

Determine the matrix Tp, relative to the entrance pupil position.

Multiply all the matrices in reverse order, starting with the translation from the last surface to the
image plane and ending with matrix Tp; the result is matrix S.

Determine a vector base x& with the set of coordinates (x, y, xp, yp).

Make the product x′& = Sx&.

•
Once x′& has been calculated, its ﬁrst four elements are polynomials of nth degree on the indepen-
dent variables (x, y, xp, yp), which model the position and direction cosines of the rays on the image
plane.

Most optical systems have stops located after the ﬁrst surface, and so the method described above
is not adequate. One can always ﬁnd the gaussian entrance pupil of any system and so revert to the
previous situation; this will work even if the entrance pupil is found to lie beyond the ﬁrst surface, in
which case it will give rise to a negative translation. The problem is that the gaussian entrance pupil
is a ﬁrst order transformation of the stop, whereas the real entrance pupil is an aberrated image of the
stop given by the portion of the optical system that lies before it. Ideally one should try to describe the
image in terms of the object coordinates and the point of passage through the stop, which can be rather
difﬁcult. Alternatively one can ﬁnd a reference ray, deﬁned as the ray that passes through the center
of the stop and is not necessarily the same as the chief ray, and work with position and orientation
coordinates on the image plane, relative to the reference ray. The plot of the relative ray position versus
its relative direction cosines can be used to describe ray aberrations [7].

5 Coefﬁcients for a spherical surface

A sphere of radius r with its center at z = r is deﬁned by the equation:

x2 + y2 + z2

2zr = 0 ;

(14)

this equation will replace (6) in the algorithm for the determination of matrix coefﬁcients. In a previous
work [6] we presented the results for third order; these are now extended to seventh order.

This is a situation where symmetry must be considered in order to reduce the size of the matrices
involved; we use the complex variables X and S previously deﬁned, leading to a complex vector base
X& whose elements have the general form X jX ∗kSlS∗m with X ∗ and S∗ representing the complex
conjugates of X and S. Kondo et al. [4] have shown that the powers must obey the condition j

1330, 1231, 1132, 1033, 0340, 0241, 0142, 0043 .

Equation (10) can now be solved and the resulting expressions for s′ and t′ can be expanded in series
up to the seventh order; the results can be combined into one complex variable S′. The second column
of table 1 lists the coefﬁcients for this expansion. Similarly the forward offset coefﬁcients can be found
solving equations (11) and combining x′ and y′ expansions into one single complex variable X1; the
resulting coefﬁcients are listed in column 3 of table 1. The backward offset coefﬁcients are obtained in
a similar way, although now it is the x and y expansions that must be combined into a single complex
variable X2.

6 Coefﬁcients for an asymmetric surface

Toroidal surfaces are used to correct eye astigmatism; they can be fabricated easily without resorting
to sophisticated machinery. In this example we deem to show that the method is applicable to general
surfaces but it is not our purpose to list high order coefﬁcients for this particular shape; therefore we
will restrict the study to third order. Also, as there is no rotational symmetry we will not use complex
coordinates; there is symmetry relative to two perpendicular planes and if we were to use complex
coordinates the terms should obey the condition j
1 as explained in reference [5]; we
feel that it is clearer not to invoke symmetry at all.

The solution of equation (10) originates the expressions for s′ and t′; these are then expanded in

same procedure was applied to the expressions for x′ and y′ resulting from equation (11); columns 4
and 5 of the same table list these coefﬁcients. The backward offset coefﬁcients need not be listed, as in
third order they can be obtained by sign reversal from the forward offset coefﬁcients.

7 Discussion and conclusion

Matrices can be used to model optical systems built with surfaces of unspeciﬁed shape to any desired
degree of approximation. The method that was described differs from those found in literature by the
choice of direction cosines rather than ray slopes to specify ray orientations. This results in a very ele-
gant formulation of Snell’s law which can be easily programmed into symbolic computation software.
In spite of some added complication in translation matrices the algorithm is limited only by computing
power in it’s ability to determine the matrix coefﬁcients, irrespective of surface complexity and order
of approximation. For axis-symmetric systems the matrices have a dimension 40
40 for seventh
order and can usually be dealt with by ordinary PCs; the inﬂuence of stops can also be incorporated
in the matrix description as was demonstrated. The unconventional coordinate system that was used
can, if needed, be converted to the more usual ray slope coordinate system through the product with
conversion matrices of the same dimension.

×

Two examples were shown for illustration of the method’s capabilities; the ﬁrst one supplies a list
of seventh order coefﬁcients for systems made up with spherical surfaces and allows the reader an
immediate use. The second example applies the method to a fourth degree toroidal surface, showing
that complex shapes can be accommodated.

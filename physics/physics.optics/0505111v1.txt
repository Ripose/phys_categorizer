Abstract: The six-fold rotational symmetry of photonic crystal ﬁbers has
important manifestations in the radiated ﬁelds in terms of i) a focusing
phenomena at a ﬁnite distance from the end-facet and ii) the formation
of low-intensity satellite peaks in the asymptotic far ﬁeld. For our study,
we employ a surface equivalence principle which allows us to rigorously
calculate radiated ﬁelds starting from fully-vectorial simulations of the near
ﬁeld. Our simulations show that the focusing is maximal at a characteristic
distance from the end-facet. For large-mode area ﬁbers the typical distance
is of the order 10 × L with L being the pitch of the triangular air-hole lattice
of the photonic crystal ﬁber.

where S1 is a circle parallel and close to the end-facet and S2 is a semi-sphere concentric
with S1.

The photonic crystal ﬁber [1, 2] (PCF) offers a unique opportunity for realizing broadband
large-mode area (LMA) single-mode (SM) ﬁbers [3]. In high-power laser applications the LMA
property is desirable to keep the power density below the damage threshold of silica as well as
to avoid non-linear phenomena and the SM property is essential for the beam quality and the
ability to generate close to diffraction-limited beams. Recent studies of LMA-SM-PCF lasers
have suggested that the PCF technology may indeed offer good beam quality [4] as quantiﬁed
by an M-squared value [5] close to unity (M2 = 1 for a Gaussian beam).

For the fundamental mode in PCFs the near and far ﬁelds have intensity distributions which
are overall close to Gaussian, but with a six-fold rotational symmetry reﬂecting the symmetry
of the air-hole lattice. For LMA-PCFs there are no signiﬁcant deviations from a Gaussian dis-
tribution for intensities above the 1/e2 level [6] and for many practical applications the mode
may be considered Gaussian. However, as studied recently the derivation from a Gaussian dis-
tribution has some important consequences [7]. In the near-ﬁeld the intensity is suppressed at
the locations of the air-holes and in the asymptotic far-ﬁeld these suppressions manifest them-
selves as low-intensity satellite peaks. Furthermore, in the near ﬁeld to far-ﬁeld transition the
intensity becomes strongly focused at a ﬁnite distance from the end-facet as can be understood
by a simple Gaussian decomposition of the near ﬁeld.

While the simple decomposition approach has proved very useful for the qualitative under-
standing of the near to far-ﬁeld transition the laser applications call for a more quantitative study
of the radiated ﬁeld. Calculating the diffraction pattern is generally a complicated task, which
involves the full solution to the elastic scattering problem at the end-facet. Here, we rigorously
calculate radiated ﬁelds from the end-facet utilizing a surface equivalence principle [8].

The calculations of the modal reﬂectivity from the ﬁber end-facet is performed with a three-
dimensional frequency domain modal method relying on Fourier expansion technique [9, 10].
In brief, the Fourier expansion method relies on an analytical integration of Maxwells equations
along one direction (the ﬁber axis) and on a supercell approach in the other two transversal di-
rections. We emphasize that for the radiated ﬁeld at the surface S1 we have treated the elastic
scattering at the end-facet fully, i.e. the incident fundamental mode is partly reﬂected (no mode
mixing for symmetry reasons) and partly radiated/transmitted. Through the surface equivalence
principle, any wave-front can be considered as a source of secondary waves which add to pro-
duce distant wave-fronts according to Huygens principle.

In order to apply the surface equivalence principle, we surround the end-facet radiating ﬁber
with an imaginary closed surface S = S1 + S2, where S1 is a circle parallel and close to the
end-facet and S2 is a semi-sphere concentric with S1, see Fig. 1. Both of these surfaces are of
inﬁnite extent. By considering proper surface currents on S which are equivalent in the sense

that they yield the same ﬁeld outside S, we can formally erase all the existing elements inside
S and ﬁll it with a perfect electric conducting (PEC) body. The equivalent surface electrical
and magnetic currents on S are Je(r) = ˆn × H and Me(r) = − ˆn × E, respectively, where ˆn is an
outward normal to the surface S [8]. Of course, these currents radiate in the presence of the PEC
and not in unbounded free-space. Because of the inﬁnite radius of S2, electromagnetic ﬁelds on
this surface take zero value. On S1 electromagnetic ﬁelds are determined from near-ﬁelds. Since
the S1 surface is an inﬁnitely extended ﬂat PEC body we can utilize image theory to replace
the conductor by image currents −Je and Me. Ultimately, computation of radiated ﬁelds of
an open-ended PCF is simpliﬁed to computing radiated ﬁelds of the ﬁctitious current source
M(r) = 2Me(r) = −2 ˆn × E in free-space. Calculating radiated ﬁelds of the current source can
be achieved systematically through electric p e(r) and magnetic p m(r) Hertz vector potentials
deﬁned by:

Employing these potentials, electric and magnetic ﬁelds are obtained by:

is the free-space wavelength. From Eqs. (2a) and (2b) we
expect an improvement in computational time by a factor of roughly two compared to a direct
use of the surface equivalence principle [11] in which both ﬁctitious electric and magnetic
surface currents exist.

We employ the described approach in a fully vectorial study of the evolution of the funda-
mental mode of a PCF from near-ﬁeld to far-ﬁeld. As an example we consider the fundamental
mode in a pure-silica PCF with a normalized air-hole diameter d/L = 0.45 and in our sim-
ulations we utilize the scale-invariance of Maxwell’s equations for a frequency-independent
dielectric function. Recent experimental studies showed quite complicated interference phe-
nomena in the near to far-ﬁeld transition [7] and in particular a focusing behavior was observed
at a ﬁnite distance from the end-facet. As illustrated in Fig. 2 this focusing phenomena is born
out by our numerical simulation where the peak intensity of the radiation increases up to short
distances from the ﬁber end-facet. The electric ﬁeld intensity is maximal at a distance z0 which
is typically in the range L . z0 . 10 × L
. At this particular distance the intensity pattern is
rotated by an angle of p /6 compared to the near-ﬁeld, in full agreement with the experimen-
tal observations. As the wavelength is increased relative to the pitch the diffraction by the six
inner-most air holes increases and z0 shifts closer to the end facet of the PCF. We emphasize
that this interference phenomenon has no counterparts for e.g. step-index ﬁbers with cylindrical
symmetry; the focusing relies fully on the six-fold rotational symmetry of the air-hole lattice.
It should also be emphasized that the phase-front is non-trivial (non-constant) in the transverse
plane at z0 and in that sense the focusing differs from that observed with a classical lens.

In Fig. 3 we show the electric ﬁeld amplitude at various distances from the end-facet up to
the asymptotic far-ﬁeld region. The nearly hexagonal shape of the fundamental mode of the
ﬁber (Panel A) is transformed into a nearly circular shape (Panel B) which is followed by a
hexagonal shape at z ≃ z0 (Panel C) where the orientation is rotated by an angle of p /6 with
respect to the ﬁber mode at z = 0. This hexagonal shape expands as it propagates (Panels D and
E) and then becomes close to circular again above the 1/e amplitude level (Panel F). As the

distance from the end-facet becomes larger, six satellites start emerging from the mode shape
below the 1/e amplitude level (Panel G). Finally, for larger distances satellites appear clearly
(Panel H).

As an alternative to the above rigorous approach, it is in ﬁber optics common to approximate
the far ﬁeld by a Fourier transformation of the near ﬁeld [12]. Here we shall derive this expres-
sion starting from the above formalism. In the far-ﬁeld limit we approximate the
in the
denominators of Eqs. (1a) and (1b) by r and in the exponential we correspondingly approximate
it by r − ˆr · r′, where ˆr = r/r is the unit radial vector of the spherical coordinate. The magnetic
Hertz vector potential, Eq. (1b), then simpliﬁes to

Fig. 4 shows a plot of the asymptotic far-ﬁeld intensity, including results of the rigorous
surface-equivalence principle as well as the approximate far-ﬁeld calculated from Eq. (6). The
far-ﬁeld pattern is computed for l /L = 0.1 at a distance of 1000 × L
from the end-facet,
which is far from the starting point of the Fraunhofer region. For an extended source of electro-
magnetic radiation, the Fraunhofer region appears at a characteristic distance 2D2/l
from the
source where the parameter D is deﬁned by the maximum linear dimension of the source. For a
PCF D ∼ 2L

far-ﬁeld intensity calculated with the rigorous surface-equivalence principle. We observe six
low-intensity satellite peaks as well as further high-order diffraction peaks, in full agreement
with experimental observations [1, 7]. As seen, the approximate results of Eq. (6) are in quali-
tative agreement with the full numerical solution, and it is only in the sub-1/e2 intensity regime
that we observe quantitative deviations. This suggests that Eq. (6) could be a good starting point
for numerical calculations of the NA and the M-squared value for LMA PCFs, which we will
report elsewhere.

In conclusion we have used a surface equivalence principle to rigorously calculate radiated
ﬁelds starting from fully-vectorial simulations of the near ﬁeld. Our simulations have revealed

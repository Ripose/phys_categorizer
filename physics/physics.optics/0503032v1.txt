Abstract

The roughness of glass surfaces after diﬀerent stages of etching is in-
vestigated by reﬂection measurements with a spectrophotometer, light
scattering, and atomic-force microscopy (in small scale), and Talysurf
(in large scale). The results suggest, there are three regimes during
etching, according to their optical reﬂectivity and roughness. The ﬁrst
and second regimes are studied by the Kirchhoﬀ theory and the third
one is studied by the geometric theory. Also, we compare the roughness
obtained by the optical scattering to the AFM results.

Introduction

The technology of micro fabrication of glass is gaining in importance because
more and more glass substrates are currently being used to fabricate micro
electro mechanical system (MEMS) devices [1]. Glass has many advantages
as a material for MEMS applications, such as good mechanical and optical
properties, high electrical insulators, and it can be easily bonded to silicon
substrates at temperatures lower than for fusion bonding [2]. Also micro and
nano-structuring of glass surfaces is important for the production of many
components and systems such as gratings, diﬀractive optical elements, pla-
nar wave guide devices, micro-ﬂuidic channels and substrates for (bio) chem-
ical lab-one-chip applications [3, 4], although wet etching is well developed
for some of these applications [5, 6]. There are diﬀerent ways to enhance the
eﬃciency of some optical devices such as semiconductors lasers, solar cells
etc. One of possible ways is light is allowed to have more reaction with ma-
terial in which is propagated. Consequently the surface boundaries, need to
be roughened. In planar wave guides on the other hand the surface bound-
aries have to be as smooth as possible to have good light conﬁnement [7, 8].

with etching time 2 and 12 minutes, respectively. (c) and (d) are Talysurf
surface images with 0.75µm, with etching times 20 and 70 minutes.

To get reliable surface roughness, it has to be employed non-expensive and
nondestructive method to measure their roughness. In recent years, AFM
has become available tool for studying microstructure changes in material
science. This technique enables us to measure and describe the shape mate-
rial surface with minimal sample preparation [9, 10, 11]. Although this is a
precise technique, it is an expensive and diﬃcult method. Also we may only
investigate very small surfaces by this technique. Study of wave scattering
from self-aﬃne (fractal) surfaces has become very active; see for example
references [12-19]. Because scattering of light from random rough surfaces
is a subject of great interest, both from a theoretical point of view and for
applications, a large number of papers have been devoted to the subject.
The measurement of light scattering at rough surfaces and its relationship
with the statistical parameters and functions describe the surface roughness
and correlation length. This technique enables us to measure roughness of
large area.

2 Experiments

We started with glass microscope slides as a sample. Only one side of sam-
ples was etched by HF solution for various etching times, 2 to 70 minutes,
after cleaning by proper detergents. HF concentration was %40 for all exper-
iments. The scattered light intensity of samples was measured as a function
of angle, I(θ) using a setup consisting of a He-Ne laser (λ = 632.8nm),
a photo-multiplier tube (PMT) detector and a computer controlled micro-
stepper rotation stage. The resolution of the micro-stepper was 0.5 minutes
per step. The surface topography of the etched glass samples in small scale
(< 5σm) was obtained using an atomic force microscope (AFM) (Park Sci-
entiﬁc Instruments). The images in small scale were collected in a constant
force mode and digitized into 256× 256 pixels. A commercial standard pyra-
midal Si3N4 tip was used. A variety of scans, each with size L, were recorded
at random locations on the surface. The large scale (> 5µm) morphology
line scans of the samples were recorded using a surface proﬁle-meter (Taylor
Hobson). Fig. 1 shows typical AFM image and surface proﬁle data with
resolutions of about 20nm and 0.75µm, respectively.
In order to directly
characterize diﬀerent samples, we also used the Jascow spectrophotometer.
In Fig. 2 an illustration of the eﬀect of the etching time on the specular
reﬂectivity measurement is presented. The reﬂectivity is normalized to the
smooth glass R0, and represented as a function of wavelength and etching
time. As the etching time increases, RS

R0 approaches to zero.

3 Theory

3.1 General notations

It is known that to derive the quantitative information of the surface mor-
phology one may consider a sample of size L and deﬁne the mean height h
of the etching surfaces and its roughness σ by [20]:

2
σ(L, t) = (h(h − h)

i)

1/2

Here t is etching time, that is a factor which can apply to control the glass
surface roughness, and the < · · · > denotes an averaging over diﬀerent
samples. In this work, we study the statistical parameters of the surfaces.
One of the possible initial conditions is assuming to have a ﬂat interface and
the correlation function of the rough surface is denoted by C(R):

C(R) =

< h(r)h(r + R) >
σ2

,

and the correlation length λ0 , is a distance at which the correlation function
falls by 1/e.

4 Kirchhoﬀ’s expressions for reﬂection

Kirchhoﬀ theory, also known as tangent plane or physical optics theory is
the most widely used in the study of wave scattering from rough surfaces
[21]. Kirchhoﬀ theory has been applied to the study of One and two dimen-
sional exact approaches have been successfully applied to dielectric, metallic
or perfectly conducting surfaces [22, 23] dielectric ﬁlms on a glass substrate

(1)

[24] and dielectric ﬁlms [25, 26]. Such exact calculations have been com-
pared with experimental results and approximate models [24, 27]. Also some
authors studied wave scattering from random layers with rough interfaces
[28, 29].

The Kirchhoﬀ theory is based on three major assumptions: a) The sur-
face is observed from far ﬁeld. b) The surface is regarded as ﬂat, and the op-
tical behavior is locally identical to any given point on the surface. Therefore
the Fresnel laws can be locally applied. c) The amplitude of the reﬂection
coeﬃcient, R0 is independent of the position on the rough surface. The ﬁeld
scattered by the rough surface, ψsc(r), considering far ﬁeld approximation
is obtained by integration over the mean reference plane SM : (the geometry
is displayed in Figure 3)

where

A = sin θ1 − sin θ2 cos θ3,

B = − sin θ2 sin θ3,

C = −(cos θ1 + cos θ2),

a = sin θ1(1 − R0) + sin θ2 cos θ3(1 + R0),

b = sin θ2sinθ3(1 + R0),

c = cos θ2(1 + R0) − cos θ1(1 − R0)

In the derivation of the Eq. (2), it is assumed that the incident wave
ψin is a plane wave with a wave vector k as ψin(r) = exp(ik · r). The height
distribution function (PDF) and correlation function of surfaces, which we
used are Gaussian.
It is shown that for such surfaces the total scattered
intensity can be written as [21]:

< I >= I0 exp(−g)+ < Id >

(4)

Where I0 and are the scattered from a smooth surface and the diﬀuse inten-
sity respectively and g can be written as: g = k2σ2C 2. Therefore, we may
divide them into three domains depends on the value of g as below:

(a) Slightly rough surfaces:

When the wave length is long enough compared to σ or g ≪ 1, the diﬀuse
reﬂectance may be neglected. Therefore in specular direction the average
intensity is [21]:

b) Intermediate roughness surface

Surfaces for which g ∼ 1 are regarded as moderately rough. For this case,
it can be provided an upper and lower bound to the diﬀuse ﬁeld intensity
as [21]:

where AM is the mean area of the scattering surface.

c) Very rough surfaces

To obtain a solution in this limit i.e. when g ≫ 1, we used the total
scattered ﬁeld rather than the diﬀuse ﬁeld[21]. For a Gaussian correlation
function, the diﬀuse ﬁeld leads to:

For very rough surfaces the coherent ﬁeld will be negligible and Eq. (7) may
be taken to give the diﬀuse or total ﬁeld from the scattering surfaces.

5 Results and Discussion

Referring to Fig. 2, it can be seen that as the etching time increases the
specular reﬂection of the samples are decreased. This depends on the sur-
It has been shown that the g parameter,
face roughness of the samples.
Eq. (6), of the samples less than 12 minutes etching time are very less than
unity, whereas for the samples with around 20 minutes etching time, g is
almost equal to one, and for those with 30 and 40 minutes etching time g
is very larger than unity which are compatible with predicted domains by
the Kirchhoﬀ theory. But the results of etched samples larger than about
50 minutes, cannot be explained by this theory. In this regime, geometric

properties of light are more dominant than its wave properties. The scat-
tered intensity as a function of scattered angle θ2 of some samples has been
appeared on Fig. 4. It can be seen that, as it is expected, the etching time
of glass, aﬀects on the intensity of scattered light. To calculate the surface
roughness, σ, and correlation length, λ0, of the samples in the three regimes
we used the data from AFM and Talysurf. As it is known the resolution of
the information from AFM is between few nanometers to several microme-
ters, so for the samples with larger surface roughness we had to use the data
from Talysurf. In Fig. 1, the illustration of the eﬀect of etching time on the
surface morphology from AFM and Talysurf are presented. These ﬁgures
exhibit an increasing of surface roughness due to an increasing of etching
time. To compare the results from AFM and Talysurf with those calculated
using the light scattering for the three mentioned regimes, we list following
results:

a) In the regime 1, for the samples with etching time less than 12 min-
utes, Eq. (7) was used to calculate σ. Fig. 5 shows the comparison of the
surface roughness determined by AFM experiments and the one obtained
by the Kirchhoﬀ theory. According to this ﬁgure, the surface roughness is
almost a linear function of etching time of glass samples in a log-log coordi-
nate for both data obtained from AFM and direct measurement of scattered
intensity. The agreement between both groups of data for samples with etch-
ing time less than 12 minutes is very good. At larger roughness, there are
fairly disagreements between the theory and experiment, because scattering
plays a role in larger roughness and aﬀects the measured intensity in specu-
lar reﬂectance. If the surface roughness gets larger, the requirements of the

ﬁrst domain of the Kirchhoﬀ theory do not hold any more, then the rough-
ness from the reﬂection analysis and from AFM no longer agree because of
the increasing role of scattering.

b) In the regime 2, for the intermediate g ≈ 1 and very rough surfaces
g ≫ 1, we are dealing with the samples with etching time around 20 minutes,
and 30-50 minutes, respectively. Figuer 6 demonstrate σ for diﬀerent etch-
ing times of glass that calculated by Talysurf data. To compare the given
data with the results from the Kirchhoﬀ theory, both intermediate regime
and very rough surface regime are compatible. Fig. 7 shows the comparison
between scattering spectrum obtained from the Kirchhoﬀ theory of a very
rough surface and that which is obtained from the experiment corresponding
an etching time of 40 minutes. c) In the regime 3, it was found that for the
samples with etching time larger than 50 minutes the surface roughness and
the correlation length are quite larger than the wave length for which the
limitations of the Kirchhoﬀ theory hold and it cannot be used. So, it can be
considered that the rough surface is covered by some local smooth surfaces
(i.e. meshes) with the size (σ × λ0), that these sizes are larger than the wave
length. So, we used a theory based on geometric optics considerations. To
describe the angular distribution of intensity of reﬂected light, we considered
the angular distribution of the slope of rough surface, p(θ2). To calculate
p(θ2), the data from Talysurf with resolution of 0.75µm in horizontal steps
were used. Fig. 8 presents comparison of normalized scattering ﬁeld in-
tensities obtained from the Kirchhoﬀ theory and the one‘obtained from an
experiment with 70 minutes immersion. The agreement between geometric

theory and experimental measurements is rather good. The comparison
between geometric reﬂection theory and experiment is shown on Fig. 11.

Summarizingly, we studied the glass etching process by the optical scat-
tering and their statistical properties. By increasing the etching time for
a series of the samples, we have studied optical scattering, identiﬁed by
reﬂection measurements with a spectrophotometer and a setup discussed
in experimental section. We found that these properties are explained by
three regimes during etching.
In the other view, statistical properties of
their surfaces which are found by the AFM and Talysurf, conﬁrm with these
regimes. The roughness, which is obtained by the optical scattering, has a
good agreement with the experimental results.

It is shown that the two-by-two Jones-matrix formalism for polarization op-

tics is a six-parameter two-by-two representation of the Lorentz group. The

attenuation and phase-shift ﬁlters are represented respectively by the three-

parameter rotation subgroup and the three-parameter Lorentz group for two

spatial and one time dimensions. It is noted that the Lorentz group has an-

other three-parameter subgroup which is like the two-dimensional Euclidean

group. Possible optical ﬁlters having this Euclidean symmetry are discussed

in detail. It is shown also that the Jones-matrix formalism can be extended

to some of the non-orthogonal polarization coordinate systems within the

framework of the Lorentz-group representation.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Lorentz group was introduced to physics as the language of space-time symmetries

of relativistic particles [1,2]. However, this group serves useful purposes in many other

branches of physics, including optical sciences. In recent years, the Lorentz group served

as the underlying language for squeezed states of light.

It was Dirac who ﬁrst observed

that the Lorentz boost is a squeeze transformation [3].

In 1963 [4], Dirac constructed

representations of the Lorentz group using coupled harmonic oscillators.

Indeed, Dirac’s

oscillator representation forms the theoretical foundations of squeezed states of light [5–7].

This aspect of the Lorentz group is by now well known in the optics community, and the

Lorentz group is one of the theoretical tools in optics.

The squeezed state is not the only branch of optics requiring the Lorentz group. In 1981,

Bacry and Cadihilac considered application of the Lorentz group for Fourier optics [8]. In

1983, Sudarshan et al. constructed a representation of the Lorentz group for para-axial wave

optics [9]. Wavelets are known to be representations of the Lorentz group [10]. It has been

noted recently that the Lorentz group serves as the underlying language for reﬂections and

refractions [11].

In addition, in their recent paper [12], Gutierrez et al. pointed out the

relevance of the Lorentz geometry to three-dimensional concentrators.

More recently, the relevance of Lorentz transformations to polarization optics has been

discussed by several authors [11,13–16]. Indeed, in their recent paper [16], Opartrny and

Perina have shown that rotation and boost matrices from the two-by-two representation of

the Lorentz group describe energy-conserving and non-conserving optical ﬁlters respectively.

In our recent paper, we pointed out that polarization optics can be formulated in terms of

the six-parameter Lorentz group [17].

The purpose of this paper is very simple. The standard language for optical polarizations

is the Jones-matrix formalism, and it has a long history [18–20]. In this paper, we show that

this formalism is a representation of the six-parameter Lorentz group. The Lorentz group

also has a long history.

2

Among the many diﬀerent representations of this group, as has been shown in one of our

earlier papers [17], the bilinear conformal representation [2] is most convenient for polariza-

tion optics. Unfortunately, however, we were not able to connect there the representation

with the Jones-matrix formalism, and we shall complete the task in the present paper.

The six-parameter Lorentz group has three major subgroups. They are the three-

parameter rotation group, the three-parameter O(2, 1) group, and the three-parameter E(2)-

like group. The mathematics of the rotation group is well known. It is shown in Ref. [17]

that the rotation group is the underlying language for optical ﬁlters causing phase shifts

between the two transverse components. The O(2, 1)-like groups have been extensively dis-

cussed recently in connection with squeezed states of light, and it is a very familiar language

in optics. It is known that this O(2, 1)-like group is the proper language for attenuation

ﬁlters [15,17].

The E(2)-like group is useful in understanding the internal space-time symmetries of

massless particles [21], but is relatively new in optics [22]. We discuss in this paper possible

optical ﬁlters possessing this E(2)-like symmetry. Since this requires a detailed knowledge

of the six-parameter Lorentz group, and since this group is relatively new in optics, we shall

include in this paper a systematic introduction to the Lorentz group applicable to three

spatial and one time-like dimensions.

The rotation and squeeze transformations discussed in this paper are directly applicable

to coordinate transformations. Thus, they are applicable to the case of where the polariza-

tion occurs along a skew or squeezed coordinate system. It is known that one of the E(2)-like

transformation leads to a “shear” transformation. The formalism is therefore is applicable

also to the case where the polarization coordinate is sheared. The polarization plane is not

always perpendicular to the propagation direction of the light wave. The formalism can be

extended to accommodate this case.

In Sec. II, we prove that the Jones-matrix formalism is indeed a representation of the

Lorentz group. In Sec. III, the mathematics of Sec. II is translated into transformation

matrices corresponding to optical ﬁlters. It is shown that the combined eﬀect of attenuation

3

and phase-shift ﬁlters leads to a six-parameter two-by-two matrix. It is noted in Sec. IV that

the bilinear conformal representation of the Lorentz group is the natural scientiﬁc language

for polarization optics. It shown that the attenuation and phase-shift ﬁlters have their own

sub-representations. It is shown that one of those sub-representations leads to a new kind

of optical ﬁlter having the E(2)-like symmetry. In Sec. V, we discuss a possible new class

of optical ﬁlters having the symmetry of the two-dimensional Euclidean group, and their

possible applications in Sec. VI.

In Sec. VII, we show that the formalism developed in

this paper can accommodate the cases where the polarization coordinates are squeezed or

sheared. The formalism can be extended also the case where the polarization plane is not

perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

Since the Lorentz group is relatively new in optical sciences, we present the four-by-four

and two-by-two representations of this group in Appendices A and B respectively. Since

E(2) group plays the central role in this paper, we give an introduction to this group in

Appendix C.

II. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

In studying polarized light propagating along the z direction, the traditional approach is

to consider the x and y components of the electric ﬁelds. Their amplitude ratio and the phase

diﬀerence determine the state of polarization. Thus, we can change the polarization either

by adjusting the amplitudes, by changing the relative phases, or both. For convenience,

we call the optical device which changes amplitudes an “attenuator” and the device which

changes the relative phase a “phase shifter.”

Let us write the electric ﬁeld vector as

Ex = A cos (kz − ωt + φ1),

Ey = B cos (kz − ωt + φ2),

(2.1)

where A and B are the amplitudes which are real and positive numbers, and φ1 and φ2 are

function.

the ratio:

with

operator:

the phases of the x and y components respectively. This form is useful not only in classical

optics but also applicable to coherent and squeezed states of light [7,23].

The traditional language for this two-component light is the Jones-matrix formalism

which is discussed in standard optics textbooks [20]. In this formalism, the above two com-

ponents are combined into one column matrix with the exponential form for the sinusoidal

Ex

A exp {i(kz − ωt + φ1)}
B exp {i(kz − ωt + φ2)} 


.













This column matrix is called the Jones vector. The content of polarization is determined by

which can be written as one complex number:

Ex

w = reiφ

r =

,

φ = φ2 − φ1.

The degree of polarization is measured by these two real numbers, which are the amplitude

ratio and the phase diﬀerence respectively. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the

transformation properties of this complex number w. The transformation takes place when

the light beam goes through an optical ﬁlter whose transmission properties are not isotropic.

The text-book version of the Jones-matrix formalism [20] starts with the projection

applicable to the Jones vector of Eq.(2.2). This operator keeps the x component and com-

(2.5)





pletely eliminates the y-component of the electric ﬁeld. This is an oversimpliﬁcation of the

real world where the attenuation factor in the y direction is greater than that along the x

5

direction. We shall replace this projection operator by an attenuation matrix which is closer

to the real world.

Another element in the traditional formalism is

which leads to a phase diﬀerence of δ between the x and y components. The polarization

axes are not always the x and y axes. For this reason, we need the rotation matrix

P (0, δ) =

e−iδ/2

R(θ) =

cos(θ/2) − sin(θ/2)

sin(θ/2)





.

cos(θ/2) 


The traditional Jones-matrix formalism consists of systematic combinations of the above

three components given in Eq.(2.5), Eq.(2.6) and Eq.(2.7).

In this paper, we replace the projection operator of Eq.(2.5) by a squeeze matrix. There

are two transverse directions which are perpendicular to each other. The absorption co-

eﬃcient in one transverse direction could be diﬀerent from the coeﬃcient along the other

direction. Thus, there is the “polarization” coordinate in which the absorption can be

described by

e−η1



e−η2 


= e−(η1+η2)/2

eη/2

0





e−η/2 


with η = η2 − η1 . Let us look at the projection operator of Eq.(2.5). Physically, it means

that the absorption coeﬃcient along the y direction is much larger than along the x direction.

The absorption matrix in Eq.(2.8) becomes the projection matrix if η1 is very close to zero

and η2 becomes inﬁnitely large. The projection operator of Eq.(2.5) is therefore a special

case of the above attenuation matrix.

The attenuation matrix of Eq.(2.8) tells us that the electric ﬁelds are attenuated at two

diﬀerent rates. The exponential factor e−(η1+η2)/2 reduces both components at the same rate

and does not aﬀect the state of polarization. The eﬀect of polarization is solely determined

by the squeeze matrix

This type of mathematical operation is quite familiar from studies of squeezed states of

light, if not from Lorentz boosts of spinors. For convenience, we call the above matrix an

attenuator. Thus, we are expanding the Jones-matrix formalism by replacing the projection

operator of Eq.(2.5) by the squeeze operator in Eq.(2.9).

The phase-shifter of Eq.(2.6) can be written as

P (0, δ) = exp (−iδJ1),

J1 =

.

(2.10)

(2.11)

Our notation for the Pauli sigma matrices is diﬀerent from those appearing in the conven-

tional literature, and is explained in detail in Appendix D.

The rotation operator of Eq.(2.7) takes the form:

R(θ) = exp (−iθJ3),

(2.12)

The squeeze operator of Eq.(2.9) can also be written in the exponential form:

S(0, η) = exp (−iηK1),

(2.13)

It is now possible to construct a closed set of commutation relations with the above

generators J1, J3, and K1. Then the result is a set of six generators given in Appendix

B. They are the generators for the group SL(2, c) which is locally isomorphic to the six-

parameter Lorentz group. This is the mathematical content of this paper. Let us next

exploit the physical contents of this mathematical formalism.

III. COMBINED EFFECTS

If the polarization coordinate is the same as the xy coordinate where the electric ﬁeld

components take the form of Eq.(2.1), the above attenuator is directly applicable to the

column matrix of Eq.(2.2). If the polarization coordinate is rotated by an angle θ/2, or by

the matrix

R(θ) =

cos(θ/2) − sin(θ/2)

sin(θ/2)





,

cos(θ/2) 


(3.1)

then the squeeze matrix becomes

S(θ, η) = R(θ)S(0, η)R(−θ)

eη/2 cos2(θ/2) + e−η/2 sin2(θ/2)

(eη/2 − e−η/2) cos(θ/2) sin(θ/2)

=





(eη/2 − e−η/2) cos(θ/2) sin(θ/2)
e−η/2 cos2(θ/2) + eη/2 sin2(θ/2) 


.

(3.2)

We can obtain the inverse of this transformation by rotating the ﬁlter or the above

expression around the z-axis by 90 degrees.

If we apply two squeeze matrices, the net result becomes

S (θ2, η2) S (θ1, η1) = S (θ3, η3) R(ψ),

(3.3)

where R(ψ) is a rotation around the z axis by ψ. This means that the multiplication of two

squeeze matrices does not lead to another squeeze matrix, but a squeeze matrix preceded

by a rotation matrix. This aspect of the squeeze operation is well known from the squeezed

state of light, and has been discussed extensively in the literature [7,14,15]. As was noted

in Sec. II, the generators K1 and J3 are needed for the squeeze matrix of Eq.(3.2). The

repeated application leads to the commutation relation for these two generators:

[J3, K1] = iK2.

(3.4)

Indeed, J3, K1 and K2 form a closed set of commutation relations for the Sp(2) or O(2, 1)-like

subgroup of SL(2, c) [15]. This three-parameter subgroup has been extensively discussed in

connection with squeezed states of light [5,7].

8

Another basic element is the optical ﬁlter with two diﬀerent values of the index of re-

fraction along the two orthogonal directions. The eﬀect on this ﬁlter can be written as

eiδ1

0





0
eiδ2 


= e−i(δ1+δ2)/2

e−iδ/2

0





,

0
eiδ/2 


with δ = δ2 − δ1 . In measurement processes, the overall phase factor e−i(δ1+δ2)/2 cannot

be detected, and can therefore be deleted. The polarization eﬀect of the ﬁlter is solely

determined by the matrix

P (0, δ) =

e−iδ/2

0





.

0
eiδ/2 


This form was noted as one of the basic components of the Jones-matrix formalism in Sec.

II. This phase-shifter matrix appears like a rotation matrix around the z axis in the theory

of rotation groups, but it plays a diﬀerent role in this paper. We shall hereafter call this

Here also, if the polarization coordinate makes an angle θ with the xy coordinate system,

matrix a phase shifter.

the phase shifter takes the form

P (θ, δ) = R(θ)P (0, δ)R(−θ)

e−iδ/2 cos2(θ/2) + eiδ/2 sin2(θ/2)

(e−iδ/2 − eiδ/2) cos(θ/2) sin(θ/2)

=





(e−iδ/2 − eiδ/2) cos(θ/2) sin(θ/2)

eiδ/2 cos2(θ/2) + e−iδ/2 sin2(θ/2) 


.

(3.7)

Here again, we can obtain the inverse of this transformation by rotating the ﬁlter around

the z-axis by 90 degrees.

If we consider only the phase shifters, the mathematics is basically repeated applications

of J1 and J2, resulting in applications also of J3, where their explicit two-by-two matrix

forms are given in Appendix B. Thus, the phase-shift ﬁlters form an SU(2) or O(3)-like

subgroup of the group SL(2, c).

If we use both the attenuators and phase shifters, the result is the full SL(2, c) group

with six parameters. The transformation matrix is usually written as

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.8)

L =

α β

γ





with the condition that its determinant be one: αρ − γβ = 1. The repeated application of

two matrices of this kind results in





The most general form of the polarization transformation is the application of this algebra

to the column matrix of Eq.(2.2).

The generators of the rotation or phase-shifters are Hermitian. Thus, the unitary subset

of the L matrices of Eq.(3.8), it represents the three-parameter rotation-like subgroup or

the phase-shifters and their repeated applications. The generators J3, K1 and K2 are all

imaginary. Thus, the real subset of the L matrices represents the attenuation ﬁlters and

their repeated applications.

IV. BILINEAR CONFORMAL REPRESENTATION OF THE LORENTZ GROUP

In the present formulation of polarization optics, we are interested in calculating one

complex variable deﬁned in Eq.(2.4). As was noted in Ref. [17], we can obtain the same

algebraic result by using the bilinear transformation :

w′ =

ρw + γ
βw + α

.

The repeated applications of these two transformations can be achieved from

Then, it is possible to write w2 as a function of w, and the result is

w1 =

ρ1w + γ1
β1w + α1

, w2 =

ρ2w1 + γ2
β2w1 + α2

.

w2 =

(γ2β1 + ρ2ρ1)w + (γ2α1 + ρ2γ1)
(α2β1 + β2ρ1)w + (α2α1 + β2γ1)

.

This is a reproduction of the algebra given in the matrix multiplication of Eq.(3.9). The

form given in Eq.(4.1) is the bilinear representation of the Lorentz group [2].

10

(3.9)

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

Let us consider the physical interpretation of this result. If we apply the matrix L of

Eq.(3.8) to the column vector of Eq.(2.2), then

which gives

In term of the physical quantity w deﬁned in Eq.(2.4), this formula becomes

This equation is identical to the bilinear form given in Eq.(4.1), and the ratio w can now

be identiﬁed with the w variable deﬁned as the parameter of the bilinear representation of

the Lorentz group in the same equation. Indeed, the bilinear representation is clearly the

natural language for polarization optics.

Let us next consider subgroups. For the phase-shifters, the subgroup is represented by

the unitary matrix

This form is preserved in the bilinear representation. As for the attenuation subgroup, all

the components are real, and this aspect is also preserved in the bilinear representation.

Let us next consider another form of bilinear transformation.

This is also a form-preserving transformation. This form can be transformed into the matrix

form

Let us study this sub-representation in detail in Sec. V.

V. NEW FILTERS

We should note at this point that the Lorentz group has another set of three-parameter

subgroups. They are like the two-dimensional Euclidean group. Let us consider one of them,

which is generated by the matrices J1, N2 and N3, with

N2 = J2 + K3,

N3 = J3 − K2,

where

N2 =

,

N3 =

0 1





0 −i





.

0 

These matrices satisfy the commutation relations:

[J1, N2] = iN3,

[J1, N3] = −iN2

[N2, N3] = 0.

(5.3)

They indeed form a closed set of commutation relations. As shown in Appendix C, these

commutation relations are like those for the two-dimensional Euclidean group consisting of

two translations and one rotation around the origin. This group has been studied extensively

in connection with the space-time symmetries of massless particles, where J1 and the two

N generators correspond to the helicity and gauge degrees of freedom respectively [21].

The physics of J1 is well known through the phase shifter given in Eq.(2.6). If the angle

δ is π/2, the phase shifter becomes a quarter-wave shifter, which we write as

Then J2 and K3 are the quarter-wave conjugates of J3 and K2 respectively:

Q = P (0, π/2) =

e−iπ/4



J2 = QJ3Q−1,

K3 = −QK2Q−1.

Consequently,

The N generators lead to the following transformation matrices.

N2 = QN3Q−1.

transformation matrix T3.

(5.8)

This new ﬁlter superposes the y component of the electric ﬁeld to the x component with an

appropriate constant, but it leaves the y component invariant.

Let us examine how this is achieved. The generator N3 consists of J3 which generates

rotations around the z axis, and K2 which generates a squeeze along the 45o axis. Physically,

J3 generates optical activities. Thus, the new ﬁlter consists of a suitable combination of these

two operations. In both cases, we have to take into account the overall attenuation factor.

This can be measured by the attenuation of the y component which is not aﬀected by the

symmetry operation of Eq.(5.8).

Is it possible to produce optical ﬁlters of this kind? Starting from an optically active

material, we can introduce an asymmetry in absorption to it by either mechanical or electrical

means. Another approach would be to pile up alternately the J3-type and K2-type layers.

In either case, it is interesting to note that the combination of these two eﬀects produces a

special eﬀect predicted from the Lorentz group.

The E(2)-like symmetry includes transformations generated by J1, which is given in

Eq.(2.11). The transformation matrix is

P (0, δ) =

e−iδ/2

0





,

0
eiδ/2 


(5.9)

This matrix is given in Eq.(2.6) and its physics are well understood. Let us apply this matrix

to T3 from left and from right. Then

13

This leads to

P (0, δ)T3(τ ) =

(5.10)

(5.11)

We can of course obtain the P (0, −δ) ﬁlter by rotating the P (0, δ) around the z axis by 90

degrees. It is thus possible to add a phase factor to the τ variable using phase shifters of

the type P (0, δ).

VI. POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS OF THE NEW FILTER

The three-dimensional rotation group occupies an important place in many diﬀerent

branches of physics. The group O(2, 1) also is useful in a number of ﬁelds including op-

tics [7,24–26]. Thus, traditional attenuation and phase-shift ﬁlters may be useful in con-

structing analog computers performing the symmetry operations of these groups.

The group E(2) is somewhat new in optics [22]. However, as was noted in Appendix C,

it deals with translations and rotations on a ﬂat surface. This ﬁlter may therefore be useful

as a computational device for recording and reading two-dimensional maps. Furthermore,

the T3 matrix of Eq.(5.7) has an interesting algebraic property:





(6.1)

The matrix can therefore be used for converting multiplication into addition, like the loga-

rithmic function. This is one of the most basic operations in computational machines.

As for a more immediate application, let us consider lens optics. It is a trivial laboratory

operation to rotate a given ﬁlter around the z axis by 90 degrees. If we rotate the matrix of

Eq.(6.3), the result is the matrix of the form

This form together with the original form of Eq.(6.3) serve as lens and translation matrices

respectively in para-axial optics.

Indeed, a system of polarization ﬁlters can serve as an

analog computer for a multi-lens system.

Furthermore, the matrix of the form

represents a “shear” transformation. This is one of the basic deformations in engineering

applications.

The Lorentz group was introduced to physics as the basic language for space-time symme-

tries of elementary particles [1], but it is becoming increasingly prominent in many branches

of physics and engineering including classical and quantum optics. The optical ﬁlters may

provide excellent calculational tools for the Lorentz group. Thus, these ﬁlters may be useful

VII. NON-ORTHOGONAL COORDINATE SYSTEMS

Since the light polarization is caused by anisotropic crystals, the polarization coordinate

is not always orthogonal. Let us consider ﬁrst the case where the light polarization is along

a pair of skew or squeezed axes.

It was noted in this paper that the O(2, 1)-like subgroup can take care of attenuation ﬁl-

ters. A transformation matrix of this subgroup can also transform the orthogonal coordinate

system into a squeezed coordinate system. The matrix takes the form

cosh(η/2)

The idea is to transform the squeezed coordinate system into the orthogonal system using

the matrix or its inverse given in the above expression. Next, we can perform the polarization

algebra developed in this paper for the orthogonal coordinate system. We then can transform

the result obtained in the orthogonal system back to the original squeezed coordinate system.

It is interesting to note that the transformation matrix given in Eq.(7.1) is one of the

transformation matrices within the frame work of the Lorentz-group representation devel-

oped in this paper, and there is no need to make the existing mathematics more complicated.

The story is the same for the shear transformation which takes the form

This transformation is also well within the framework discussed in this paper.

The polarization plane is not always perpendicular to the direction of the propagation.

We can take care of this problem by extending our two-by-two formalism of Eq.(3.8) into

the three-by-three form

applicable to the (x, y, z) coordinate system. The polarization plane can be rotated around

the x axis by

Using this matrix or its inverse, we can bring the problem to the orthogonal coordinate

system. After doing the standard polarization algebra, we can go back to the original

coordinate system.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper, we have replaced the projection operator of Eq.(2.5) by the squeeze matrix

given in Eq.(2.9). This brings the Jones-matrix formalism closer to the real world. This also

enables us to formulate the problem within the framework of the Lorentz group.

(7.4)

There are now many powerful mathematical tools derivable from the Lorentz group [7,26].

We can use them to study more systematically varous aspects of optics. The present paper

is the ﬁrst step toward a systematic exposition of polarization optics. There are several

interesting future problems. First, it is now possible to study the relation between the

Jones vectors and the Stokes parameters using the mathematical theorems of the Lorentz

group connecting Minkowskian four-vectors and SL(2, c) spinors. Furthermore, the natural

language of the Lorentz group is based on circularly polarized states of photons.

It is

therefore an interesting future problem to work out the Jones-matrix formalism applicable

to circularly polarized lights.

It is widely understood that the Lorentz group started gaining its prominence in optics

through squeezed states of light [5]. This is not true. This group was discussed much earlier

in connection with polarization optics [31]. However, we learned the connection between

squeeze transformations and Lorentz boosts while studying squeezed states of light [7]. The

Lorentz group is now a powerful mathematical device because there are many squeeze trans-

formations in physics, including the Jones-matrix formalism discussed in the present paper.

It is also gratifying to note that the symmetry of the Lorentz group is useful for various

engineering applications of light waves including their polarizations, reﬂections, and their

propagation media [32]. In physics, it is relatively new to study Maxwell’s equations in terms

of the Lorentz group [26]. It is thus a challenging future problem to combine the symmetries

of electromagnetic waves developed in engineering with those developed in physics.

These boost generators satisfy the commutation relations

[Ji, Kj] = iǫijkKk,

[Ki, Kj] = −iǫijkJk.

(A7)

Indeed, the three rotation generators and the three boost generators satisfy the closed set

of commutation relations given in Eq.(A3) and Eq.(A7). These three commutation relations

form the starting point of the Lorentz group. The generators given in this Appendix are

four-by-four matrices, but they are not the only set satisfying the commutation relations. We

can construct also six two-by-two matrices satisfying the same set of commutation relations.

The group of transformations constructed from these two-by-matrices is often called SL(2, c)

or the two-dimensional representation of the Lorentz group. Throughout the present paper,

we used the two-by-two transformation matrices constructed from the generators of the

SL(2, c) group.

APPENDIX B: SPINORS AND FOUR-VECTORS IN THE LORENTZ GROUP

In Appendix A, we have noted that there are four-by-four and two-by-two representations

of the Lorentz group. The four-by-four representation is applicable to covariant four-vectors,

while the two-by-two transformation matrices are applicable to two-component spinors which

in the present case are Jones vectors. The question then is whether we can construct the

four-vector from the spinors. In the language of polarization optics, the question is whether

it is possible to construct the coherency matrix [28,29] from the Jones vector.

With this point in mind, let us start from the following form of the Pauli spin matrices.



σ2 =

0 −1 



.

σ3 =

(B1)

These matrices are written in a diﬀerent convention. Here σ3 is imaginary, while σ2 is

imaginary in the traditional notation. Also in this convention, we can construct three

rotation generators

19

(B2)

(B3)

(B4)

(B5)

(B6)

which satisfy the closed set of commutation relations

We can also construct three boost generators

which satisfy the commutation relations

Ji =

σi,

1
2

[Ji, Jj] = iǫijkJk.

Ki =

σi,

i
2

[Ki, Kj] = −iǫijkJk.

[Ji, Kj] = iǫijkKk.

The Ki matrices alone do not form a closed set of commutation relations, and the rotation

generators Ji are needed to form a closed set:

The six matrices Ji and Ki form a closed set of commutation relations, and they are like

the generators of the Lorentz group applicable to the (3 + 1)-dimensional Minkowski space.

The group generated by the above six matrices is called SL(2, c) consisting of all two-by-two

complex matrices with unit determinant.

In order to construct four-vectors, we need two diﬀerent spinor representations of the

Lorentz group. Let us go to the commutation relations for the generators given in Eqs.(B3),

(B5) and (B6). These commutators are not invariant under the sign change of the rotation

generators Ji, but are invariant under the sign change of the squeeze operators Ki. Thus, to

each spinor representation, there is another representation with the squeeze generators with

opposite sign. This allows us to construct another representation with the generators:

˙Ji =

σi,

˙Ki =

1
2

−i
2

σi.

(B7)

We call this representation the “dotted” representation.

If we write the transformation

matrix L of Eq.(3.8) in terms of the generators as

20

then the transformation matrix in the dotted representation becomes

L = exp

−

(θiσi + iηiσi)

,

(

Xi=1

3

3

˙L = exp

i
2

−

(

Xi=1

(θiσi − iηiσi)

.

)

)

In both of the above matrices, Hermitian conjugation changes the direction of rotation. How-

ever, it does not change the direction of boosts. We can achieve this only by interchanging

L to ˙L, and we shall call this the “dot” conjugation.

Likewise, there are two diﬀerent set of spinors. Let us use u and v for the up and down

spinors for “undotted” representation. Then ˙u and ˙v are for the dotted representation. The

four-vectors are then constructed as [27]

u ˙u = −(x − iy),

v ˙v = (x + iy),

u ˙v = (t + z),

v ˙u = −(t − z)

leading to the matrix

C =

u ˙v −u ˙u



v ˙v −v ˙u 


u

v 


=



( ˙v − ˙u ) ,


where u and ˙u are one if the spin is up, and are zero if the spin is down, while v and ˙v are



zero and one for the spin-up and spin-down cases. The transformation matrix applicable to

the column vector in the above expression is the two-by-two matrix given in Eq.(3.8). What

is then the transformation matrix applicable to the row vector ( ˙v, − ˙u) from the right-hand

side? It is the transpose of the matrix applicable to the column vector ( ˙v, − ˙u). We can

obtain this column vector from

(B8)

(B9)

(B10)

(B11)

(B12)

(B13)

by applying to it the matrix

,

˙v
− ˙u 






g = −iσ3 =

0 −1

.

0 


1





21

This matrix also has the property

gσig−1 = − (σi)T ,

(B14)

where the superscript T means the transpose of the matrix. The transformation matrix

applicable to the column vector of Eq.(B12) is ˙L of Eq.(B9). Thus the matrix applicable to

the row vector ( ˙v, − ˙u) in Eq.(B11) is

T

g−1 ˙Lg
n

o

= g−1 ˙LT g.

This is precisely the Hermitian conjugate of L.

In optics, this two-by-two matrix form appears as the coherency matrix, and it takes the

form

< E∗

xEx > < E∗

< E∗

xEy > < E∗

y Ex >
y Ey > 


,

C =





where < E∗

i Ej > is the time average of E∗

i Ej. This matrix is convenient when we deal with

light waves whose two transverse components are only partially coherent. In terms of the

complex parameter w, the coherency matrix is proportional to

if the x and y components are perfectly coherent with the phase diﬀerence of δ. If they are

totally incoherent, the oﬀ-diagonal elements vanish in the above matrix.

Let us now consider its transformation properties. As was noted by Opartrny and Pe-

rina [16], the matrix of Eq.(B16) is like

where the set of variables (x, y, z, t) is transformed like a four-vector under Lorentz trans-

formations. Furthermore, it is known that the Lorentz transformation of this four-vector is

achieved through the formula

C =

1

re−iδ





,

reiδ
r2 


C =

t + z

x − iy

x + iy



,

t − z 


C ′ = LCL†,

22

(B15)

(B16)

(B17)

(B18)

(B19)

where the transformation matrix L is that of Eq.(3.8). The construction of four-vectors from

the two-component spinors is not a trivial task [27,30]. The two-by-two representation of

Eq.(B18) requires one more step of complication.

APPENDIX C: TWO-DIMENSIONAL EUCLIDEAN GROUP

Let us consider a two-dimensional plane and use the xy coordinate system. Then Lz

deﬁned as

will generate rotations around the origin. The translation generators are

Lz = −i

x

− y

∂
∂y

(

∂
∂x )

Px = −i

Py = −i

∂
∂x

,

∂
∂y

.

(C1)

(C2)

These generators satisfy the commutation relations:

[Lz, Px] = iPy,

[Lz, Py] = −iPx

[Px, Py] = 0.

(C3)

These commutation relations are like those given in Eq.(5.3). They become identical if Lz,

Px and Py are replaced by J1, N2 and N3 respectively.

This group is not discussed often in physics, but is intimately related to our daily life.

When we drive on the streets, we make translations and rotations, and thus make trans-

formations of this E(2) group.

In addition, this group reproduces the internal internal

space-time symmetry of massless particles [1]. This aspect of the E(2) group has been

extensively discussed in the literature [26,27,33].

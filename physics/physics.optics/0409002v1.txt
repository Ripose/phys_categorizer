Resonant modes in triangular dielectric cavities

Manhattan, KS 66506-2601
(Dated: August 12, 2004)

The resonant optical modes of a high permittivity dielectric prism with an equilateral triangular
cross section are discussed. Eigenmode solutions of the scalar Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet
boundary conditions, appropriate to a conducting boundary, are applied for this purpose. The par-
ticular plane wave components present in these modes are analyzed for their total internal reﬂection
behavior and implied mode conﬁnement when the conducting boundary is replaced by a sharp di-
electric mismatch. Improvement in TIR conﬁnement by adjusting the longitudinal wavevector kz
is also discussed. For two-dimensional electromagnetic solutions (kz = 0), TE polarization leads to
longer lifetime than TM polarization, assuming that escape of evanescent boundary waves at the
corners is the primary decay process.

INTRODUCTION

Micro-sized dielectric cavities are becoming increas-
ingly important, due to their applications especially
in microlasers and resonators with various geometries,
including disks,[1] triangles,[2] squares,[3, 4, 5] and
hexagons.[6, 7] Materials where the two-dimensional
cross-section controls the properties include, for exam-
ple, various cleaved semiconductor structures[2] as well
as zeolite ALPO4-5 crystals.[6] Even more interesting
are lasing semiconductor pyramids that grow by natu-
ral processes.[8, 9, 10]

An understanding of the geometry dependence of the
total internal reﬂection (TIR) that produces resonant
modes can lead to improvements in designs of optical
devices. For the reduced two-dimensional electrodynam-
ics (ﬁelds independent of a z-coordinate along an axis
of symmetry), the boundary element method[11] is very
powerful for determining the scattering ﬁelds in TM or
TE polarizations. Alternatively, here we present a sim-
pler analysis of the resonant modes based only on an
analysis of the conditions needed for TIR within a dielec-
tric cavity. The calculation is approximate but simple,
especially for a geometry where the related Helmholtz
equation has an exact analytic solution.

Here we consider the modes in equilateral triangular-
based prisms and their two-dimensional (2D) analogs; the
triangular system is chosen here for its interesting sym-
metries and known analytic Helmholtz solution.[12, 13,
14, 15, 16, 17] As a ﬁrst approximation, a 2D dielectric
system with Dirichlet boundary conditions (DBC) is con-
sidered, taking the ﬁelds equal to zero at the boundary,
equivalent to a metallic or conducting boundary. The
exact analytic solutions for this 2D triangular system are

reviewed; each mode is a superposition of only six plane-
wave components. We describe how the mode informa-
tion is useful for determining which modes will be con-
ﬁned if the dielectric is surrounded by a lower index di-
electric (or vacuum), rather than a perfect conductor, us-
ing the conditions for TIR. A careful analysis shows that
when a mode is strongly conﬁned in the cavity by TIR,
Dirichlet boundary conditions apply (approximately) to
the relevant Helmholtz equation for both the TM and
TE polarizations. The simple plane wave components of
each mode can be analyzed in terms of Maxwell’s equa-
tions and the related Fresnel amplitude ratios, which are
slightly diﬀerent for TM and TE polarizations.[18] These
diﬀerences are shown to imply longer estimated lifetimes
for the TE modes, enhanced by a factor of the order of
the squared index ratio (n/n′)2, when compared to the
lifetime of the corresponding TM mode.

Obviously some error is made compared to employing
a more technically complete solution of Maxwell’s equa-
tions such as boundary element methods;[11] the ﬁelds
discussed here for the dielectric mismatch boundary are
not close to the true ﬁelds unless the mismatch is very
large. This approach, however, should approximately de-
termine the symmetries of the conﬁned modes and give
reasonable estimates for the dielectric mismatch needed
for their conﬁnements. The improvement of conﬁnement
for ﬁnite–height prisms with the same cross sections, al-
lowing for nonzero longitudinal wavevector kz, is also dis-
cussed.

which automatically enforces DBC at the ends of the
prism. As a result, for the prism geometry, we only solve
the separated Helmholtz equation for two dimensions,

where c is the speed of light in vacuum and t is time.
The cavity shape being considered is a prism with an
equilateral triangular cross-section of edge a in the xy-
plane; the height is h along the z axis. Ultimately, we
want to discuss which modes will be conﬁned in the cavity
of index of refraction n = √ǫµ when it is surrounded by
a uniform medium of lower index of refraction n′ = √ǫ′µ′
(for example, vacuum).

We ﬁrst analyze the modes, assuming the ﬁelds go to
zero at the cavity walls, using Dirichlet boundary condi-
tions (DBC), which corresponds to perfectly conducting
walls, or a mirrored cavity. The range of applicability of
these boundary conditions for a mode that is conﬁned by
TIR caused by an index mismatch, rather than reﬂect-
ing boundaries, is discussed subsequently. A solution at
iΩt time dependence, cor-
frequency Ω is sought, with e−

In the general case, we can consider that we are look-

rect linear combination to satisfy the required boundary
conditions. These diﬀerent components have the same
squared wavevector, although they can possess diﬀerent
directions of propagation and diﬀerent amplitudes. The
symmetry of the situation, however, requires only some
reduced set of possible wavevectors for triangular-based
prisms.

A wavevector is composed from a z-component, kz,
along the vertical or longitudinal axis, and the remaining
2D components in the xy plane, k2

A. 2D Electromagnetics at a boundary between
media

For 2D E&M problems, which are deﬁned by no depen-
dence of the ﬁelds along the prism axis, one takes kz = 0,
ignoring any boundary conditions at the prism ends
(which can be considered at inﬁnity). Then Maxwell’s
equations and their associated physical boundary condi-
tions show that one need only consider transverse mag-
netic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarizations of
the ﬁelds. (Presence of nonzero kz for a dielectric waveg-
uide surrounded by a diﬀerent dielectric medium, in gen-
eral, does not lead to separated TM and TE modes, see
Ref. 18.) It is well-known that in a conducting waveguide
or resonator, at the boundaries of the 2D cross-section,
the ﬁeld ψ = Ez for TM modes satisﬁes DBC, and the
ﬁeld ψ = Bz for TE modes satisﬁes Neumann bound-
ary conditions (NBC). Alternatively, if the medium is
surrounded simply by a diﬀerent (nonconducting) dielec-
tric medium, there still are TM or TE polarizations, but,
strictly speaking, these would satisfy the more involved
boundary conditions of Maxwell’s equations, rather than
the oversimpliﬁed DBC or NBC. If the ﬁelds are strongly
undergoing TIR (incident angle well beyond the critical
angle), however, both polarizations are shown here to
satisfy DBC, to a certain limited extent. This can be
seen by examining the actual vector ﬁelds present under
the reﬂection and refraction at a boundary between two
media, for the two possible polarizations.

Consider a planar boundary between two media, where
the boundary deﬁnes the xz-plane. The region y < 0 is
occupied by a medium of index n = √ǫµ, while the re-
gion y > 0 is occupied by a medium of index n′ = √ǫ′µ′,
with n > n′. Primes refer to quantities on the refracted
wave side (ultimately, outside the system we are study-
ing). The wavevector magnitudes are k = ω
c √ǫµ and
k′ = ω
c √ǫ′µ′ in the two media. All the waves in this

gating in medium n with ~ki = (kx, ky) = k(sin θi, cos θi)
and incident on the boundary, can be polarized in two
ways, which correspond exactly to the TM and TE po-
larizations.

∼

Diagrams of the two possible situations are given, for
example, in Chap. 7 of Ref. 18. For ~Ei perpendicular
to the plane of incidence (xy-plane), ~Ei = Ei ˆz, and the
magnetic ﬁeld will have no z-component anywhere, which
is the same as the TM polarization. On the other hand,
for ~Ei lying within the plane of incidence, ~Bi = Bi ˆz, and
the electric ﬁeld has no z-component anywhere, corre-
sponding to the TE polarization. Thus, we can use the

(8a)

Fresnel reﬂection and refraction amplitudes for these two
cases, that result from the actual boundary conditions for
Maxwell’s equations, to investigate the appropriateness
of applying DBC for ﬁelds undergoing TIR. Furthermore,
this analysis will be used for determining the properties
of the evanescent refracted wave under TIR; the power
lost in this boundary wave can be expected to play a role
in the lifetime of a resonant mode.

Inspection of Eq.
(12) shows that the Ez ﬁeld on the incident side acquires
a node at the boundary y = 0 and satisﬁes Dirichlet
BC only when the phase shift attains the value α = π.
According to (11), this occurs only in the limit θi →
90◦, i.e., extreme grazing incidence. Alternatively, at the

threshold for TIR (θ = θc), (11) gives α = 0, whereby
(12) indicates that the Ez ﬁeld now will peak at y = 0
and satisﬁes a Neumann BC.

Seeing that the BC on Ez ranges between the two ex-
tremes of DBC and NBC, clearly neither boundary con-
dition is fully applicable to the TIR regime. However,
it suggests that one should use NBC for ﬁnding the TIR
threshold conditions, and DBC to determine the ﬁeld dis-
tributions at large enough index mismatch. One can get
some indication of the crossover to DBC-like behavior by
locating the incident angle θi = ˜θ where the phase shift
passes π

In the usual practical situation, with µ = µ′

cos θc. For usual optical media with very weak
√2
magnetic properties, one sees that a large index ratio
n/n′
ǫ/ǫ′ does not increase the range of applicability
of Dirichlet BC for TM polarization. To give a numerical
example, for a weak index mismatch with sin θc = 1/2,
giving θc = 30◦, the crossover angle is ˜θ = 52.2◦;
in
order to reach phase angle α = 0.9π, quite close to DBC,
requires an incident angle θi = 82.2◦. Even for a larger
mismatch sin θc = 1/4, with θc = 14.5◦, one gets only a
slight improvement to ˜θ = 46.8◦, and to get to α = 0.9π
still requires θi = 81.3◦.

The conclusion is that it makes some reasonable sense
to apply NBC to ﬁnd the limiting conditions for TIR,
but, in general, provided the incident angle is suﬃciently
larger than the crossover angle ˜θ, an approximate descrip-
tion of the ﬁelds on the incident side should be possible
using DBC. The application of DBC to this problem im-
proves with higher index mismatch, but not as strongly
as one would hope, because the phase angle does not de-
pend on the dielectric permittivities for this polarization.

TE polarization: The discussion is similar, but now
the magnetic ﬁeld ~B is polarized in the ˆz direction ev-
erywhere, and controls the other ﬁelds, according to re-
lations ~B = √ǫµ ˆk
~E for each plane wave, and am-
plitude relations B = √ǫµ E. Taking incident wave

Clearly, the behavior of Bz near the boundary for TE po-

for TM polarization. It means that provided the incident
angle is far enough beyond the critical angle, one should
also apply DBC for TE ﬁelds; NBC would only be rea-
sonable just beyond the TIR threshold. However, due
to the presence of the permittivity ratio in (16), a large
index mismatch does enhance the applicability of DBC
for TE polarization. The crossover incident angle ˜θ at

where the latter expression applies when µ

some numerical examples, now the modest index mis-
match with sin θc = 1/2 and θc = 30◦ leads to a very
nearby crossover angle ˜θ = 32.8◦, meaning that the
strong TIR regime and region of adequate applicability
of DBC is very wide. For larger mismatch sin θc = 1/4
with θc = 14.5◦, the DBC regime is even closer to θc, be-
ginning around ˜θ = 14.9◦. Thus, application of Dirichlet
BC to ﬁnding the 2D resonant modes for a cavity with
TE ﬁeld polarization should be very acceptable, even
more so than for TM polarization, except when the mode
has plane wave components extremely close to their TIR
threshold.

Within the limitations indicated in the above analysis,
we continue by discussing the modes in a 2D equilateral
triangle, under the assumption of DBC for either the TM
or TE polarizations.

B. Exact modes for an equilateral triangle with
DBC

The triangular cross section oﬀers an opportunity for
exact solutions to the 2D Helmholtz equation. This
problem has been solved analytically[12, 13, 14, 15] for
both DBC and NBC in several contexts, including quan-
tum billiards problems,[17, 19, 20, 21] quantum dots,[16]

only the triangles with angle sets π( 1

and π( 1
6 ) are classically integrable[20] and have sim-
ple closed form wavefunction solutions derived in various
ways,[13, 14, 21] following the ﬁrst solution for trian-
gular elastic membranes by Lam´e.[12] Here we use the
equilateral triangle of edge length a for its interesting
symmetries and resulting simpliﬁcations.

Coordinates are used where the origin is placed at the
geometrical center of the triangle, and the lower edge is
parallel to the x-axis, as shown in Fig. 1. The notation
b0, b1, and b2 is used to denote the lower, upper right,
and upper left boundaries, respectively. This discussion
concerns DBC.

Following Chang et al.,[2] some comments can be made
on the sequence of reﬂections a plane wave trapped in the
cavity makes, but with a slightly diﬀerent physical inter-
pretation. A plane wave leaving the lower face (b0) at
angle β to the x-axis sequentially undergoes reﬂections
at the other two faces, generating plane waves at angles
120◦, relative to the x-axis. Finally, when
240◦
reﬂected again oﬀ the lower face, it comes out at 120◦
β,
which does not match the original wave unless β = 60◦.
However, when allowed to propagate again around the
triangle, the sequence of angles is 120◦ + β,
β, which
then comes out at +β after the reﬂection oﬀ the lower
face. So the wave closes on itself after two full revolu-

the sequence of reﬂections starting with β = 70◦ from
boundary b0 are shown in Fig. 1. In general, any origi-
nal wave simply generates a set of six symmetry related
120◦ and inversions through the y-
waves rotated by

These considerations show that the general solution is
a superposition of six plane waves, which can be obtained
by 120-degree rotations of one partially standing wave.
Consider initially a wavevector with xy Cartesian com-
ponents, ~k = (k1, k2), and deﬁned basic vectors ~k1 = k1 ˆx,
~k2 = k2 ˆy, producing a wavefunction written as

will produce other choices of the two independent wave-
functions. For m = 0, the wavefunction ψ can be made
pure real; the modes are non-degenerate and n must be
even, since m and n must be of equal parity.

to a wavelength of λ = 2π

height of the triangle. Naively, one might have expected
that a half-wavelength of the lowest mode could have ﬁt
across the triangle, as would occur in simple rectangular
or one-dimensional geometry. Apparently, that choice
would not have the ability to fully satisfy DBC on all
three surfaces.

The wavefunctions of the lowest modes with m = 0
are displayed in Fig. 3. All the modes with m = 0 have
this typical triangular shape, periodically patterned over
the entire system. Wavefunctions of the ﬁrst two ex-
cited states are presented in Figs. 4 and 5. Each of these
states, having nonzero m, is doubly degenerate, therefore,
there is some arbitrariness in the wavefunction pictures.
Two degenerate wavefunctions were obtained from the
real and imaginary parts of ψ in Eq. (25); an equivalent
degenerate pair can be obtained by changing the complex
A0. The degenerate pairs can be shown to be
constant
orthogonal in the usual sense. Wavefunctions for the se-
quence of many of the other lowest modes are displayed at
www.phys.ksu.edu/~wysin/. The modes described here
are the complete set of allowed modes for the triangular
geometry.

C. Equilateral triangle with NBC

Although we do not apply these in this work, it is inter-
esting to note the minor diﬀerences in the solutions when
the triangle is solved with Neumann BC.[15] As far as the
changes in the wavefunctions, NBC simply requires the
sine functions in the expressions for ψ0, ψ1, and ψ2, Eqs.
(20), (21), (22), to be replaced by cosine functions. The
expressions (26) and (27) for the allowed wavevectors are
still valid, except that the restriction m < n should be
n. So the spectrum is expanded slightly,
changed to m
there is an entire set of nondegenerate lower modes with
m = n (alternatively with rotated indexes (m, 0)); the
NBC ground state is lower than the DBC ground state.

D. 3D prisms

For a 3D triangular-based prism of height h, and base
edge a, the solutions to the wave equation can be written
as products of an xy-dependent part ψxy and a part ψz
depending only on the vertical coordinate z. The cor-
responding k and kz have already been discussed above.
Solutions can be found combining k and ψxy from the
2D solutions with the kz and ψz discussed above. This
approach would assume DBC over the all surfaces of the
cavity. While the physical situation would not exactly
satisfy the requirements for classiﬁcation of modes in TM
and TE polarizations, the error in this assumption should
be least at small kz. Thus, it could give some rough idea
about the modiﬁcation of the conﬁned modes due to the
ﬁnite vertical height of the cavity.

III. TIR CONFINEMENT AND THE
RESONANT MODE SPECTRUM

Knowing the eigenmodes of the cavity, various ques-
tions can be addressed and answered based on the struc-
ture of the wavefunctions. The primary question is:

which modes are conﬁned by TIR (or resonant) when the
previously assumed Dirichlet boundary conditions are re-
placed by an index mismatch at the boundary? As seen
below, some states can never be TIR conﬁned. States
which have the possibility for conﬁnement will be refered
to as TIR states. Related to this is to estimate a decay
time for any of the TIR modes.

As suggested in the Introduction, the mode conﬁne-
ment can be determined approximately by identifying
those modes which completely satisfy the elementary re-
quirements for total internal reﬂection. We assume that
outside the system boundary a diﬀerent refractive ma-
terial with relative permeability µ′ and permittivity ǫ′
(which could be vacuum for greatest simplicity) and in-
dex n′ = √ǫ′µ′, rather than a conducting boundary. The
wavefunction analysis above describes a mode as a su-
perposition of plane waves with the speciﬁed (full 3D)
wavevectors ~K. Each plane wave component can be an-
alyzed to see whether it undergoes TIR at all system
boundaries on which it is incident. If all the plane wave
components of a mode satisfy the TIR requirements, then
the mode is conﬁned; it should correspond to a resonance
of the optical cavity. If any of the plane wave components
do not satisfy TIR, the ﬁelds of the mode will quickly leak
out of the cavity and there should be no resonance at that
mode’s frequency (also, without TIR, the assumption of
DBC is completely invalidated). These results clearly de-
pend on the index ratio from inside to outside the cavity,
denoted as

For 2D geometry, Eqs. (34) is applied directly to 2D
wavevectors, ~Ki = ~ki: one just needs to identify the
parallel component of ~ki relative to a boundary, for each
for each plane wave present in ψ, Eq. (25). The main
diﬃculty is to satisfy TIR on all boundaries on which
that component is incident.

For 3D prismatic geometry, the wavevector ~Ki includes
a z-component. The net parallel component needed in
(34) can include planar (xy) and vertical (z) contribu-
tions. The addition of a z-component will have the
tendency to raise the energy of any mode, and the net
wavevector magnitude, thereby improving the possibility
for mode conﬁnement.

A. Conﬁnement in 2D triangular systems

−

For both the TM and TE 2D modes of an equilateral
triangle, we can use the exact solutions in Sec. II B to
investigate whether these can be conﬁned by TIR. Due
to the threefold rotational symmetry through angles of
120◦, the TIR condition need only be ap-
0◦, 120◦ and
plied on one of the boundaries, say, the lower boundary
b0, parallel to the x-axis. The ﬁrst wave ψ0 is com-
posed of two traveling waves, one incident on b0 and
one reﬂected from b0; both have wavevectors whose x-
component is k1 = 2π
3a m, where m = 0, 1, 2, .... The other
rotated waves ψ1 and ψ2 are composed from traveling
waves whose wavevectors have x-components of magni-
tudes 1
√3n with n = 1, 2, 3....

(35)

The x-component of the ψ0 wave is always the smallest;
this wave has the smallest angle of incidence on b0, so if
it undergoes TIR then so do ψ1 and ψ2, and the mode is
conﬁned. As k1 is the component parallel to boundary
b0 (i.e., ki
), the condition for TIR conﬁnement of the
mode is

(37)

This relation contains some interesting features. First,
since all modes have m < n, the LHS is always less than
1, and conﬁnement of modes can only occur for ade-
quately large refractive index ratio, N > 2. For N < 2 all
modes will leak out of the cavity; they cannot be stably
maintained by TIR. Secondly, for any particular value
N > 2, relation (37) determines a critical m/n ratio;
modes whose m/n ratio is below the critical value will
not be stable. As m/n relates to the geometrical struc-
ture of the mode wavefunction, there is a strong relation
between the conﬁned mode structures and the refractive
index. An alternative way to look at this, is that each
particular mode will be conﬁned only if N is greater than
a speciﬁc critical value determined by the m/n ratio for
that mode:

n2
m2 + 1.

N > Nc =

(38)

3
r
The relation shows that generally speaking, modes with
smaller n/m are most easily conﬁned; stated otherwise,
the modes where m is closest to n are the ones most
readily conﬁned. On the other hand, all modes with m =
0 leak out, because these have wave components with a
vanishing angle of incidence on the boundaries.

where the m/n ratios (as indicated) lie above the solid curve,
p
corresponding to TIR on all boundaries [relation (37)]. Inter-
sections on the N-axis give the critical index ratios for each
mode.

Fig. 6 is a kind of phase diagram for mode conﬁnement
by TIR. Some of the modes’ m/n ratios are plotted vs.
refractive index ratio N, together with relation (37). A
particular mode is conﬁned only if its m/n value falls
above the critical curve. In this way one can easily see the
critical refractive indexes for each mode. As mentioned
above, modes where m is close to n require the smallest
refractive index values for conﬁnement.

One more application of these results is shown in
Fig. 7, where the frequency of the lowest conﬁned mode
is plotted versus √ǫµ, with vacuum outside the cavity
(ǫ′µ′ = 1). The quantum numbers (m, n) for the lowest
conﬁned mode are indicated in each curve segment. The
two diﬀerent curves correspond to plotting ωa/c (dashed)
and frequency scaled with refractive index, (ωa/c)√ǫµ
(solid). Of course, as √ǫµ approaches the value 2, the
lowest frequency becomes large and the minimizing mode
has m very close to n, with both large. At the opposite
limit of large values of √ǫµ, the lowest frequency becomes
small, and the mode (1, 3) is always the lowest frequency
mode that is conﬁned for any √ǫµ > 5.29 . The graph
only shows the minimum conﬁned frequency at the inter-
mediate values of refractive index √ǫµ.

B. Conﬁnement in triangular based prisms

We consider a vertical prism of height h with a triangu-
lar base of edge a. With perfectly reﬂecting end mirrors
at z = 0 and z = h the allowed longitudinal wavevec-
tors would be kz = lπ/h, where l is an integer. For a
plane wave component with 2D wavevector ~ki, the net

This increases the incident angles on the walls of the
cavity: the presence of nonzero kz should enhance the
possibility for conﬁnement, compared to the purely 2D
system.

At the lower and upper ends of the prism, the parallel

is the full 2D ~ki, which can be expressed as

It is a rather intriguing result; choosing h/a such that a
mode will occur at this kz will be the optimum choice for
having the mode conﬁned most easily by TIR. This could
be useful for control over selection of desired modes in a
cavity.

Cautionary comments are in order. The above dis-
cussion applies exactly only to a scalar wave. For elec-
tromagnetic waves, it applies to either the TM or TE

polarizations in an approximate sense for quasi-2D EM
modes, requiring small longitudinal wavevector kza < 1.
The greatest enhancements in TIR were found to occur at
values kza > 1, primarily because a reasonably large kz
is needed in order to satisfy the TIR requirements at the
ends. The presence of signiﬁcant kz values, however, will
lead to a mixing of the TM and TE polarizations, making
this calculation invalid. Then, for practical purposes, the
calculation is mostly interesting for how it indicates the
improvement in TIR conﬁnement expected mainly on the
2D walls of the cavity, at small kz.

IV. TIR MODE LIFETIMES

For the 2D solutions (kz = 0), it is interesting to esti-
mate the lifetimes of the TIR-conﬁned modes, contrast-
ing the results for TM and TE polarizations. When all
of the plane wave components in ψ satisfy the TIR con-
ditions, there is still the possibility for the cavity ﬁelds
to decay in time. Clearly, we have only an approximate
solution, since DBC is not exactly the correct boundary
condition. The eﬀect this causes is diﬃcult to estimate.
Another source of decay are diﬀractive eﬀects: the ﬁnite
length of the triangle edge and the presence of sharp cor-
ners is likely to have special inﬂuence on the TIR that is
diﬃcult to predict. One feature, however, which can be
considered as due to diﬀraction, is the leakage of bound-
ary waves at the corners of the triangle.[23] Under condi-
tions of TIR, an evanescent wave exists within the exte-
rior medium, decaying exponentially into that medium,
and moving parallel to the cavity surface. When it en-
counters the corner of that edge, a sharp discontinuity in
the surface, it can be expected to constitute power radi-
ated from the cavity. Here we consider the mode lifetime

estimates based solely on the losses due to these bound-
ary waves.

Based on the ratio of the total energy U stored in the
cavity ﬁelds, compared to the total power P emitted by
the boundary waves from all the corners, an upper limit
of the mode lifetime can be estimated as

τ =

U
P

.

(46)

The calculations of U and P have slight diﬀerences for
TM versus TE polarization. Therefore, there is no reason
to expect these lifetimes to be the same.

Cavity energy: For both polarizations, we use the
wavefunction ψ reviewed in Sec. II B, which can be ex-

This integral can be simpliﬁed by a transformation to

of the new coordinates (X, Y ) at the lower left corner of
the triangle, with X increasing from 0 to a along edge b0,
and Y increasing from 0 to a along edge b2, the deﬁnition
of the new coordinates results from

Boundary wave power: The symmetry of the wave-
function causes the boundary wave power out of each
edge to be the same, therefore, we calculate that occur-
ring in edge b0 (at y = 0) and multiply by three for the
total power. This calculation follows that presented by
Wiersig[23] for resonant ﬁelds in a regular polygon.

Looking at the wavefunction (47), one can see that
there are three distinct plane waves incident on b0. First
is the wave with the smallest angle of incidence, resulting

On the other hand, the linear superposition of the three
waves ψ−0 , ψ+
2 leads to an interference pattern both
within the cavity, and in the evanescent waves and exte-
rior power ﬂow. Careful consideration of a linear com-
bination of two waves shows that, although interference
leads to a spatially varying ~S′ with components both par-
allel and perpendicular to the boundary, an integral num-
ber of wavelengths of that pattern ﬁts along the edge.
Thus, it is clear that the interference eﬀects can be ig-
nored in the calculation of the emitted boundary power.
For the total emitted power due to boundary waves, it
is suﬃcient to sum the individual powers for the three
independent incident waves.

For TM polarization, with ψ = Ez, the exterior
electric ﬁeld of a single evanescent wave has only a z-
component like that in Eq. (II A). Applying Snell’s law,

The result is interesting because it shows a lifetime that

For TE polarization, with ψ = Bz, the exterior

The second line of this formula highlights the diﬀerence
for TE polarization compared to TM. The factor in the
brackets is some number less than 1;
it contrasts the
bracket which reduces to cos2 θc in formula (62) for the
TM polarization lifetime when µ = µ′. The crucial dif-

The result holds as long as the index mismatch is ad-
equately large compared to the cutoﬀ value needed to
stabilize that mode by TIR. Otherwise, at smaller index
mismatch, the TM lifetime can be longer than the TE
lifetime.

Some results for τTM are presented in Fig. 10, showing
lifetimes as functions of the index mismatch for some of
the lowest modes. When scaled by the triangle size and
light speed in the cavity, the lifetimes increase abruptly
above the TIR conﬁnement limits, eventually increasing
at a slower rate. For the modes shown, dimensionless
frequencies ωa/c∗ are typically numbers greater than 10
(see Fig. 2), with the values of τ c∗/a also of the order of
10. Combining these rough results, the mode lifetimes in
units of the mode periods T are similar to

Assuming that the lifetime estimates have included the
dominant loss mechanism in the cavity, this large result
for τ /T indicates that the original assumption of a res-
onance mode weakly conﬁned by TIR should be a valid
concept. Obviously, this holds far enough above the TIR
conﬁnement limits only, keeping in mind the approxi-
mate nature of the Dirichlet boundary conditions that
were applied.

Comparitive results for τTE for the same mode indexes
are shown in Fig. 11. Due to the presence of the extra

rapidly than the TM lifetimes. As an example, for mode
(3, 5), the TE lifetime is about 6 times longer than the
TM lifetime at N = 8. On the other hand, for the mode
(1, 3), which has a much larger TIR conﬁnement limit,
the TE lifetime is only about 1/3 longer than the TM
lifetime at N = 8. Clearly, modes with (m, n) indexes
nearly the same, as in the form (m, m + 2) with large
m, require smaller index mismatch for TIR conﬁnement,
and will more closely follow the lifetime ratio determined
strongly by the index mismatch, Eq. (67).

This ratio is independent of the cavity size or dielectric
properties, increasing only with the squared mode quan-
tum number n. The TE mode lifetime under these as-
sumptions should be even larger, by the squared refrac-
tive index ratio (n/n′)2.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The resonant modes of an optical cavity with an equi-
lateral 2D cross-section have been examined in an ap-
proximate manner, starting from the exact analytic so-
lutions for Dirichlet boundary conditions. The six plane
waves that make up each mode have been analyzed for
the conditions necessary such that all are conﬁned in the
cavity by TIR. For 2D electromagnetics (kz = 0), modes
with larger ratios of quantum indexes m/n are most eas-
ily conﬁned; conversely, modes with m = 0 never undergo
TIR conﬁnement. The presence of a nonzero longitudinal
wavevector kz can be expected to improve the possibili-
ties for TIR conﬁnement.

The critical index ratios for TIR conﬁnement are the
same for TM and TE polarizations. The diﬀerent Fres-
nel factors, however, produce diﬀerent rates of energy lost
from the cavity by the evanescent boundary waves. For
the 2D problem, this was shown to lead to considerably
longer lifetimes of the TE polarization, enhanced approx-
imately by a factor of the squared index ratio (n/n′)2
conpared to the TM lifetime. The diﬀerences in these
lifetimes would be expected to imply stronger coupling
of EM ﬁelds from outside to inside the cavity in the TM
polarization; it suggests that stimulation and generation
of the modes by an external light source should be more
eﬃcient for TM polarization.

1 Problem

Deduce the emissive power of radiation of frequency ν into vacuum at angle θ to the normal
to the surface of a good conductor at temperature T , for polarization both parallel and
perpendicular to the plane of emission.

2 Solution

The solution is adapted from ref. [1] (see also [2]), and ﬁnds application in the calibration of
the polarization dependence of detectors for cosmic microwave background radiation [3, 4].

Recall Kirchhoﬀ’s law of heat radiation (as clariﬁed by Planck [5]) that

Pν
Aν

= K(ν, T ) =

hν3/c2
ehν/kT − 1

,

(1)

where Pν is the emissive power per unit area per unit frequency interval (emissivity) and

Aν = 1 − R = 1 −(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

E0r

E0i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(2)

is the absorption coeﬃcient (0 ≤ Aν ≤ 1), c is the speed of light, h is Plank’s constant and
k is Boltzmann’s constant. Also recall the Fresnel equations of reﬂection that

=

sin(θt − θi)
sin(θt + θi)

,

=

tan(θt − θi)
tan(θt + θi)

,

(3)

E0r

E0i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)⊥

E0r

E0i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k

where i, r, and t label the incident, reﬂected, and transmitted waves, respectively.

The solution is based on the fact that eq. (1) holds separately for each polarization of
the emitted radiation, and is also independent of the angle of the radiation. This result is
implicit in Planck’s derivation [5] of Kirchhoﬀ’s law of radiation, and is stated explicitly in
[6]. That law describes the thermodynamic equilibrium of radiation emitted and absorbed
throughout a volume. The emissivity Pv and the absorption coeﬃcient Aν can depend on
the polarization of the radiation and on the angle of the radiation, but the deﬁnitions of
polarization parallel and perpendicular to a plane of emission, and of angle relative to the
normal to a surface element, are local, while the energy conservation relation Pν = AνK(ν, T )
is global. A “ray” of radiation whose polarization can be described as parallel to the plane of
emission is, in general, a mixture of parallel and perpendicular polarization from the point
of view of the absorption process. Similarly, the angles of emission and absorption of a ray

1

are diﬀerent in general. Thus, the concepts of parallel and perpendicular polarization and
of the angle of the radiation are not well deﬁned after integrating over the entire volume.
Thermodynamic equilibrium can exist only if a single spectral intensity function K(ν, T )
holds independent of polarization and of angle.

All that remains is to evaluate the reﬂection coeﬃcients R⊥ and Rk for the two polar-
izations at a vacuum-metal interface. These are well known [1, 2, 7], but we derive them for
completeness.

To use the Fresnel equations (3), we need expressions for sin θt and cos θt. The boundary
condition that the phase of the wave be continuous across the vacuum-metal interface leads,
as is well known, to the general form of Snell’s law:

(5)

where k = 2π/λ is the wave number. Then,

ki sin θi = kt sin θt,

cos θt = vuut1 −

k2

sin2 θi.

To determine the relation between wave numbers ki and kt in vacuum and in the con-
ductor, we consider a plane wave of angular frequency ω = 2πν and complex wave vector
k,

E = E0ei(kt·r−ωt),

(6)

which propagates in a conducting medium with dielectric constant ǫ, permeability µ, and
conductivity σ. The wave equation for the electric ﬁeld in such a medium is (in Gaussian
units)

∂2E
∂t2 =

(7)

where c is the speed of light. We ﬁnd the dispersion relation for the wave vector kt on
inserting eq. (6) in eq. (7):

k2
t = ǫµ

ω2

4πσµω

.

(8)

For a good conductor, the second term of eq. (8) is much larger than the ﬁrst, so we write

where

(10)

is the frequency-dependent skin depth. Of course, on setting ǫ = 1 = µ and σ = 0 we obtain
expressions that hold in vacuum, where ki = ω/c.

We see that for a good conductor |kt| ≫ ki, so according to eq. (5) we may take cos θt ≈ 1
to ﬁrst order of accuracy in the small ratio d/λ. Then the ﬁrst of the Fresnel equations
becomes

E0r

E0i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)⊥

=

cos θi sin θt/ sin θi − 1
cos θi sin θt/ sin θi + 1

=

(ki/kt) cos θi − 1
(ki/kt) cos θi + 1 ≈

(πd/λ)(1 − i) cos θi − 1
(πd/λ)(1 − i) cos θi + 1

,

and the reﬂection coeﬃcient is approximated by

For the other polarization, we see that

An expression for Rk valid to second order in d/λ has been given in ref. [7]. For θi near 90◦,
R⊥ ≈ 1, but eq. (14) for Rk is not accurate. Writing θi = π/2 − ϑi with ϑi ≪ 1, eq. (13)
becomes

For θi = π/2, Rk = 1, and Rk,min = (5 − √2)/(5 + √2) = 0.58 for ϑi = 2√2πd/λ.

Finally, combining eqs. (1), (2), (12) and (14) we have

E0r

E0i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k ≈

ϑi − (πd/λ)(1 − i)

and

for the emissivities at angle θ such that cos θ ≫ d/λ.
The conductivity σ that appears in eq. (16) can be taken as the dc conductivity so long
as the wavelength exceeds 10 µm [1]. If in addition hν ≪ kT , then eq. (16) can be written

Pν⊥ ≈

4πd kT cos θ

in terms of the skin depth d.

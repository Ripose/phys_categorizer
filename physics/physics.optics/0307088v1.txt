We ﬁnd that the function that describes the surface of spherical aberration free lenses can be
used for both positive and negative refractive index media. With the inclusion of negative index,
this function assumes the form of all the conic sections and expands the theory of aplanatic optical
surfaces.
There are two diﬀerent symmetry centers with respect to the index that create an
asymmetric relationship between positive and negative index lens proﬁles. In the thin lens limit the
familiar formulas for image position and magniﬁcation hold for any index.

It was known to Ren´e Descartes as early as 1637 that
aspherical surfaces are required to convert plane waves
into spherical waves and vice versa. In the short wave-
length limit of geometric optics, the right conic surface
can bring all parallel incident light rays to a single com-
mon focus point. Most commercial lenses have spherical
proﬁles and only perform this function approximately;
they are said to have spherical aberration.
It is only
somewhat well known that a hyperboloid is the ideal lens
shape for this purpose when using media with a relative
refractive index greater than one. Less well known, is the
fact that an ellipsoid is the ideal shape for a lens com-
posed of media with relative index between zero and one
[1].

Much of the fundamental behavior of media with neg-
ative refractive index was predicted in 1968 by Veselago
[2]. Such media are not naturally occurring, so their prop-
erties were not extensively pursued at that time. Re-
cently, negative index media were demonstrated using en-
gineered composites [3, 4], and the same design paradigm
used for those composites also enables the construction
of media with index less than one and even somewhat
close to zero. This makes the question of optical element
design with these media pertinent. In this paper we will
discuss ideal (i.e. spherical aberration free) shapes for
lenses composed of media with both positive and neg-
ative index. We will derive universal formulas for lens
design that apply to media of any index, and discuss the
symmetry between positive and negative index lenses.
We will also demonstrate that, with the inclusion of neg-
ative index, a more compete theory of aplanatic optical
surfaces is obtained.

The lenses discussed here need to be clearly distin-
guished from the “perfect” lens of Pendry [5]. These
lenses can focus incident plane waves, i.e. waves from a
source object at inﬁnite distance. They are said to pos-
sess an aplanatic point at inﬁnity [6]. Plane waves are not
focused by the “perfect” lens; it has aplanatic points only
at distances within one lens thickness. The importance of
the “perfect” lens lies in its near ﬁeld focusing capability.
This work describes lenses that can focus or collect en-
ergy from distant sources where the lenses are composed

of materials from an extended parameter space, namely
negative refractive index.

Aspherical lenses are uncommon because they are diﬃ-
cult to manufacture. The requirement of λ/4 to λ/10 sur-
face roughness for good optics is quite diﬃcult to achieve
in the visible range for non spherical surfaces. However,
this requirement is automatically satisﬁed for surfaces on
the composite materials that have been used to imple-
ment negative index media. These media are composed
of unit cells that must be signiﬁcantly smaller than the
operational wavelength in order for them to function as
a homogenous media [3, 7]. The manufacturing process
that enables construction on the required sub unit cell
length scales can by default control the surface proﬁle
with one unit cell accuracy. Though the current tech-
nology may never extend to visible light, whatever the
operational wavelength of these media, sub-wavelength
surface accuracy for any desired shape is available.

The results discussed here were ﬁrst obtained by ray
tracing [1]. The ray tracing algorithm employed only
fundamental assumptions about the media dispersion ,
boundary matching, and the conservation of energy. For

Since b2 can be negative, Eq. (3) can and does gener-
ate all the conic sections for diﬀerent values of the index.
Further, nothing in this derivation precludes n from be-
ing negative, as long as the optical path length as given
by Eq. (1) is applicable. We can see this as follows. Ge-
ometric rays follow the energy direction indicated by the
Poynting vector. It is well established that, in isotropic
negative index media, the phase advance direction is op-
posite to the Poynting vector [2, 9, 10, 11], so it is ap-
propriate to use negative index in Eq. (1).

The focal length, f , can also be negative to ﬁnd lens
surfaces that generate diverging spherical waves from
plane waves (i.e. a virtual focus). The following func-
tional form gives a surface centered at z = r = 0 with
the correct concavity for plane waves on the negative z
side and spherical waves on the positive z side.

From Eqs. (4),(5) and (6), we ﬁnd the following be-

isotropic media, our algorithm is equivalent to Snell’s
law, which applies to interfaces with relative index of
either sign [4, 8, 9, 10]. The conservation of energy was
ensured using the Poynting vector, with each ray carry-
ing power into a surface being required to carry power
out.

Here, however, we show an analytical argument using
optical path length (OPL) following Hecht [1]. We wish
to ﬁnd a surface that refracts parallel rays to a single
point (Fig. 1). Parallel rays have planar wave fronts on
which the phase is constant. Rays converging to a point
have spherical wave fronts on which the phase is constant.
The desired lens surface must be contoured such that, the

This is recognized as the familiar lens makers formula
usually derived using spherical optics with the paraxial
approximation. This is not surprising since any of the
conic sections approximate a sphere when examined with
small enough aperture; the two derivations must agree on
the lens central radius of curvature. Ray tracing conﬁrms
this formula applies for both positive and negative index
and correctly gives a change in the concavity at n =
1. Because this formula is antisymmetric about n = 1,
(Fig. 3), we cannot use the same lens design for positive
and negative index. If we do, the positive and negative

zero radius of curvature.

We have not yet shown how, if at all, the position of
the optical focus of one of these lenses relates to the geo-
metric foci of its conic surface. It can be easily shown
algebraically or by ray tracing, that the optical focus
lies exactly at the position of one of the conic section’s
foci. Ray tracing also conﬁrms a simple rule that spec-
iﬁes which focus. For positive index the correct focus is
the one furthest from the branch of the conic that is used
for the lens surface. For negative index, the opposite is
true. For the lenses with parabolic (n =
1) and spheri-
cal (n = 0) surfaces that posses just one geometric focus,
it is also the optical focus.

As pointed out in Hecht [1], two conic surfaces can
be combined to construct lenses that convert diverging
spherical waves to converging spherical waves. Ray trac-
ing conﬁrms that in the thin lens limit, the usual formulas

ε, of one is the boundary between hyperbolic and ellisoidal
lens surfaces. A radius, R, of zero is the boundary between
concave and convex surfaces. The concavity indicated on

The conic sections characterized by the a, b parameters
above, can be equally well characterized by another set of
parameters, the eccentricity, ε and the major axis radius
of curvature, R, (Fig. 3 inset). This pair of parameters
is useful in that it separates the shape, given by ε, from
the length scale, given by R. Using the usual deﬁnition,
eccentricities less than one indicate ellipses and greater
than one indicate hyperbolas. Applying Eq. (4) leads to
the simpliﬁcation

regardless of the sign of the index. In Fig. 4, a double
concave parabolic lens is shown to function as a converg-
ing lens when composed of n =

1 material.

The extension of spherical aberration free lens design
to negative index media yields a more complete theory,
but the practical limitations of current negative index
media, notably strong chromatic aberration (due to me-
dia dispersion) may preclude technological interest in fre-
quency ranges where good positive index materials are
available. However, in frequency ranges where this is not
the case, (e.g. the millimeter wave range), and compos-
ite media are already in use, negative index lenses can be
advantageous. Where larger radius of curvature is desir-
able, it is worth noting that an n =
2 lens has three
times the radius of curvature of an n = 2 lens of the
same focal length, (Fig. 2). Even more signiﬁcant is the

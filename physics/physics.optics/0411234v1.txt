Abstract: We study the electromagnetic beam reﬂection from layered
structures that include the so-called double-negative materials, also called
left-handed metamaterials. We predict that such structures can demonstrate
a giant lateral Goos-H¨anchen shift of the scattered beam accompanied
by splitting of the reﬂected and transmitted beams due to the resonant
excitation of surface waves at the interfaces between the conventional and
double-negative materials as well as due to excitation of leaky modes in
the layered structures. The beam shift can be either positive or negative,
depending on the type of the guided waves excited by the incoming beam.
We also perform ﬁnite-difference time-domain simulations and conﬁrm the
major effects predicted analytically.

Introduction

An optical beam totally reﬂected from an interface between two transparent dielectric media is
known to experience a lateral displacement from the point of reﬂection predicted by geometric
optics because each plane wave component of the beam undergoes a different phase change.
Such lateral beam shift is usually called the Goos-H¨anchen effect [1]; it occurs at the angles
close to the angle of the total internal reﬂection by the interface, and the beam shift is usually
much less than the beam width.

However, much larger beam shifts are known to occur in the layered structures that support
surface or guided waves which, when excited, are able to transfer the incoming beam energy
along the interface. Such guided waves are not excited in the case of a single interface separating
two dielectric media because the phase matching condition between the incident beam and
surface waves cannot be fulﬁlled. However, guided waves can be excited in layered structures
when the beam is incident at an angle larger than the angle of the total internal reﬂection.
In this case, the guided waves are also termed leaky waves [2]. Excitations of leaky waves
by scattering of electromagnetic waves are usually realized in two well-known geometries,
which are used in the solid-state spectroscopy, also known as the attenuated (or frustrated)
total internal reﬂection experiments. These two excitation geometries are: (i) glass prism-air-
dielectric structure, usually called Otto conﬁguration [3] and (ii) prism- dielectric ﬁlm -air
structure, usually called Kretchmann conﬁguration (see, e.g. Ref. [4] and references therein).

Recent experimental fabrication [5] and extensive theoretical studies [6] of the properties of
novel microstructured materials with negative refraction, called double-negative (DNG) mate-
rials, as well as left-handed metamaterials, demonstrate that an interface between the conven-
tional and DNG media can support surface waves (or surface polaritons) of both TE and TM
polarizations [7, 8]. Existence of surface waves for all parameters of the interface suggests that
they can enhance dramatically the value of the Goos-H¨anchen effect for the beam reﬂection
because such surface waves can transfer the energy of the incoming beam along the interface,
as was ﬁrst discussed in Ref. [9].

The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we study analytically the manifestation of the
giant Goos-H¨anchen effect that can be observed in the beam reﬂection by two types of layered
structures that include DNG media. In these geometries, we demonstrate resonant excitation
of (i) surface waves at a surface of a DNG medium, and (ii) leaky waves in a structure with
a DNG slab. We study the corresponding stationary guided modes in the layered structures,
and then demonstrate, by solving the stationary scattering problem, the resonant reﬂection and
transmission due to the excitation of leaky waves in two different geometries. Second, we use
the direct numerical ﬁnite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations [10, 11] to study the
temporal dynamics of the beam scattering and surface wave excitation, and conﬁrm the major
predictions of our theory.

2. Lateral beam shift

First, we recall that, in the framework of the scalar theory of the linear wave scattering [12], the
lateral shift D
r of the beam reﬂected by a layered dielectric structure can be deﬁned as follows,

r =

dF
r
dkx

,

(1)

(2)

(3)

where the index ‘r’ refers to the beam reﬂection and F
r is the phase of the reﬂection coefﬁcient.
The approximation Eq. (1) is obtained with the assumptions that the beam experiences total
internal reﬂection and that the phase of the reﬂection coefﬁcient F
r is a linear function of the
wave vector component kx across the spectral width of the beam.

This lateral beam shift and the Goos-H¨anchen effect have been calculated for several cases
of beam reﬂection from layered structures with DNG materials, in particular, for the beam
reﬂection from a single interface [13], [10] and a periodic structure of alternating right- and
left-handed layers [14]. Also, the shift of the beam transmitted through a DNG slab has been
studied theoretically as well in Ref. [15].

However, if the phase F

r is not a linear function of the wave number kx across the spectral
width of the beam (e.g., for narrow beams with wide spectrum), the approximate formula (1)
for the shift of the beam as whole, strictly speaking, is not valid. In such a case, one can ﬁnd
the structure of both reﬂected and transmitted beams as follows,

Er,t(x) =

{R(kx), T (kx)} ¯Ei(kx) dkx,

2p Z

−¥

where ¯Ei is the Fourier spectrum of the incident beam, and then deﬁne the relative shift of
the beams, D
r,t, by using the normalized ﬁrst moment of the electric ﬁeld of the reﬂected and
transmitted beams, D

r,t , where

r,t = D

−¥ xn|Er,t(x)|2dx
(n)
r,t = R
|Er,t(x)|2dx
an

,

−¥
R

where a is the width of the incident beam.

As a matter of fact, the transverse structure of the reﬂected and transmitted beams can have
a complicated form; and, in general, it can be asymmetric so that the shift deﬁned by Eq. (3)
may differ essentially from the value following from Eq. (1).

The case D ≪ 1 corresponds to the beam shift much smaller then the beam width, whereas the
case D ≥ 1 is much more interesting, and it corresponds to the so-called giant Goos-H¨anchen
(2)
effect. The second moment of the reﬂected and transmitted beams, D
r,t , deﬁned by Eq. (3),
characterizes a relative width of, respectively, the reﬂected and transmitted beams,

Wr,t =

q

(2)
r,t .

In what follows, we assume, without speciﬁc restrictions of generality, that the interface
between the ﬁrst and the second medium is located at z = 0 and that the incident beam is Gaus-
sian and has the beam width a, i.e., at the interface the electric ﬁeld of the beam has the form
Ei(x, z = 0) = exp (−x2/4a2 − ikx0x). The angle of incidence, f , of the beam is deﬁned with
respect to the normal to the interface so that the wave number component along the interface
in the medium from which the beam is incident is kx0 = k1 sin f and the corresponding wave
number in the medium into which the transmitted beam propagates is k1 = w

(e 1m 1)/c.

3. Excitation of surface waves

We consider a two-dimensional, three-layered structure schematically depicted in Fig. 1(a),
where the input beam, is incident from an optically dense medium (the ﬁrst medium) with
e 1m 1 > e 2m 2 at an incident angle larger than the angle of total internal reﬂection. Medium 2
represents a gap layer of width d that separates Medium 1 and 3. We assume that the third
medium consists of a DNG metamaterial which possesses both negative real parts of the di-
electric permittivity e 3 and magnetic permeability m 3. The interface between medium one and
two generates reﬂected and transmitted beams. The interface between medium two and three
can support surface waves which are excited resonantly when the tangential component of the
wave vector of the incident beam coincides with the propagation constant of the corresponding
surface polariton. In such a case, the surface wave can transfer the energy along the interface
leading to an effective enhancement of the lateral shift of the reﬂected and transmitted beams.
In the geometry shown in Fig. 1, the reﬂection coefﬁcient R = R(kx) for the TE-polarized

monochromatic [∼ exp (iw

t)] plane wave is deﬁned as

R =

(a 1 + 1)(a 2 + 1) − (a 1 − 1)(a 2 − 1)e2ikz2d
(a 1 − 1)(a 2 + 1) − (a 1 + 1)(a 2 − 1)e2ikz2d ,

(4)

where a 1 = kz1m 2/kz2m 1, a 2 = kz3m 2/kz2m 3, kzi = (w 2e im i/c2 − k2
x)1/2, for i = 1, 2, 3, and c is
the speed of light in vacuum. For deﬁniteness, we consider only the case of TE polarized waves,
but our studies indicate that the results are qualitatively similar for the case of TM polarized
waves.

Using Eq. (4), we can show that the phase of the reﬂection coefﬁcient has an abrupt change
when kx coincides with the wave vector of a surface wave supported by the interface between
medium two and three. Thus, larger values of the lateral beam shift are expected at angles of
incidence for which the beam spectrum contains the wave vector components having the same
kx as the propagation constant of the surface waves. As was shown recently, both forward and
backward surface polaritons can exist at the DNG interface [8], depending on the effective
parameters X = |e 3|/e 2 and Y = |m 3|/m 2. Excitation of the forward surface waves results in
the energy transfer in the direction of incidence. A negative shift of the reﬂected beam will
be observed for the excitation of the backward surface waves, this case corresponds to the
conditions XY > 1 and Y < 1.

We chose the following parameters for the media in our three-layered structure: e 1 = 12.8,
m 1 = e 2 = m 2 = 1, e 3 = −3, m 3 = −0.5. The propagation constant of the surface waves, h, is

and for this case the surface waves at the interface are backward propagating. Figures 2(a,b)
show the dependence of the relative beam shift D
and the beam width W on the angle of in-
cidence when a/l 0 = 100/2p and d/l 0 = 3/2p , where l 0 is the free-space wavelength. A
distinctive resonant dependence of the beam shift is observed, and the maximum of this shift
corresponds to the phase matching condition kx0 = h.

In the beam proﬁles shown in Fig. 3, we observe that the reﬂected beam has a distinctive
double-peak structure. The ﬁrst peak corresponds to a mirror reﬂection, while the second peak
is shifted relative to the point of incidence. The latter can be explained by the excitation of
surface waves. At the resonance, this lateral beam shift becomes larger than the width of the
beam itself. The double-peak structure appears only for relatively narrow beams for which the
beam spectrum is wider than the spectral width of the surface wave mode, the latter can be
found as the width of the resonance shown in Fig. 2(a). The components of the beam spectrum
outside this region are reﬂected in the usual mirror-like fashion. The spectral components of
the beam near the resonance transform into an excited surface wave, and they are responsible
for the appearance of the second peak in the shifted reﬂected beam. For wider beams, such
that their spectrum completely falls into the spectral region of the surface wave mode, only
the shifted peak appears. With an increase of the beam width, though, the relative beam shift
decreases due to the fact that the absolute shift of the beam grows slower than the beam width.
Figures 2(c,d) show the relative beam shift and width versus the normalized thickness of
the gap medium. The resonances presented in Figs. 2(c,d) can be explained with the help of
a simple physics argument. Indeed, when the gap separating medium 1 and 3 is absent (i.e.
d = 0) or very small, no surface waves are excited; and the beam shift is negligible. Increasing
the width of the gap medium, we increase the quality factor of the surface mode, and thus
increase the shift of the reﬂected beam. Similarly, for large values of d surface waves are not
excited, and the shift of the reﬂected beam becomes small again.

To gain a deeper understanding of the physical mechanism for the large values of the Goos-
H¨anchen shift in the case when the layered structure includes the DNG medium, we calculate

the energy ﬂow distribution and compare it with the results for a conventional (or right-handed)
medium [16]. From the analysis of the energy ﬂow structure, we conclude that the surface wave
excited at the interface has a ﬁnite extension and a distinctive vortex-like structure as predicted
earlier in Ref. [9] and other studies. This surface wave transfers the energy in the negative
direction and, consequently, the energy is reﬂected from the interface as a shifted beam.

To make our predictions more realistic, we included the effect of losses into our analysis,
which are always present in DNG metamaterials. We introduce losses by introducing imaginary
parts into the dielectric permittivity e 3 and magnetic permeability m 3. In particular, we take
I m(m 3) = −2 · 10−5 and vary the imaginary part of e 3. We notice that the losses in the DNG
medium primarily affect the surface waves. Therefore, the major effect produced by the losses
is observed for the strongly shifted beam component.

When the beam is narrow, i.e. its spectral width is large, only a part of the beam energy
is transferred to the surface wave, while the other part is reﬂected. This case is shown is
Figs. 3(a,b). In this case an increase in the loss, i.e. the increase of the absolute value of
I m(e 3), results in the suppression of the second peak present in the reﬂected beam which,
as noted above, is due to the surface wave excitation [9].

Finally, we perform direct numerical FDTD simulations to study the temporal dynamics of
the surface wave excitation. The FDTD simulator used in these calculations is described in
[10, 11]. The DNG medium is modelled with a lossy Drude model for both the permittivity and
permeability. The cell size was set at l 0/100 to minimize any effects of the numerical disper-
sion associated with the FDTD method. We launch the beam with a waist l 0 at the incident
angle 21.17◦ to observe the backward wave excitation, i.e., this incident angle corresponds to
the resonant surface wave excitation. The medium parameters are the same as those used in
Fig. 2(a,b). The intensity of the electric ﬁeld at the ﬁnal step of the numerical simulations is
shown in Fig. 4(a). In the top part of this ﬁgure we observe the interference of the incident and
reﬂected beams. Though it is not easy to discern the double-peak structure of the reﬂected beam,
one can clearly see the surface wave excited at the boundary between air and DNG media. The

fact that the maximum of surface wave is shifted in the direction opposite to the direction of
the incident wave indicates that the excited surface wave is backward. The temporal variations
of the amplitudes of the incident and surface waves are shown in Fig. 5.

In order to observe the process of the excitation of the forward surface wave, we take the
medium parameters with a different set of values (see, e.g., Ref. [8]): e 1 = 12.8, m 1 = e 2 =
m 2 = 1, e 3 = −0.5, m 3 = −2, and d = l
. Using the theoretical approach discussed above, we
ﬁnd that for an incident beam having a waist l 0, the resonant excitation of the forward surface
waves should be observed with the incident angle of 16.32◦. The distribution of the electric ﬁeld
intensity calculated by the FDTD simulator is shown in Fig. 4(b). Here, we can identify clearly

the forward wave excitation are similar to the case of the backward wave. The amplitude of the
forward wave is much higher than the amplitude of the incident wave, in contrast to the case of
the excitation of the backward wave shown in Fig. 5.

4. Excitation of slab modes

Now we consider the ﬁve-layer structure geometry shown in Fig. 6(a). The ﬁrst and ﬁfth slabs
have the material parameters e 1 and m 1. There are two gap slabs with material parameters e 2
and m 2. The middle slab has the material parameters e 3 and m 3. Without the slabs one and ﬁve
(i.e. when d → ¥
) the structure reduces to an isolated slab. When this slab is a DNG medium,
it is known to support guided modes. The presence of the optically dense medium makes these
guided slab modes leaky [2], because these waves can now tunnel outside the guided region.
The dense media on both sides of the center slab make it possible for such leaky waves to
radiate in both directions.

For our studies, we use the same parameters as we did for the three-layered structure dis-
cussed in the previous section. The properties of the guided modes supported by a DNG slab
have been analyzed earlier in Ref. [17]. Depending on the thickness of the DNG medium, the
slab can support either one or several guided modes. Figure 6(b) shows the dependence of the
wave number of the TE-polarized modes as a function of the slab thickness.

Reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients for the scattering of monochromatic plane waves
by a layered structure can be calculated with the help of the transfer-matrix method (see, e.g.
Ref. [18]). We take the slab thickness L = 5l /2p , so that both symmetric and antisymmetric
modes can exist in this layered structure. Additionally, we select angles of incidence so that kx

Angle of incidence (deg)

Fig. 7. Dependence of the relative shifts of (a) reﬂected and (b) transmitted beams versus
the angle of incidence, for L = 5l 0/2p and d = l 0, and several values of the waist of the
incident beam a: a = l 0 (dotted), a = 5l 0 (dashed), and a = 10l 0 (solid). The vertical

will be the same as one of the guided modes, as was discussed above, to achieve large values
of the lateral shift of the reﬂected beam

Figure 7 shows the shift of the reﬂected and transmitted beams, calculated with the help of
Eq. (3), as a function of the angle of incidence. There is a distinctive resonant behavior for
this shift. For a wide beam, the resonance maxima correspond to the phase matching condition
kx0 = h; and, measuring the position of such resonances, we can determine the thickness of the
DNG slab with a precision exceeding a wavelength. However, the two-peak structure of the res-
onances disappears for narrower beams because such beams have a wide angular spectrum and,
hence, both modes are excited simultaneously. Moreover, the relative shift of the transmitted
beam can be much larger than that of the reﬂected beam. This happens because the transmit-
ted wave is composed only of a beam emitted by the excited leaky wave whereas the reﬂected
beam consists of two parts: this leaky wave part and the mirror-like beam reﬂected from the
structure. In contrast, the positive resonances in the low wave number gap regions correspond
to the resonant reﬂections from that gap. The resulting ﬁelds can also be treated as excitations
of leaky waves that are guided by the air gaps.

Figure 8 shows the shift of the reﬂected and transmitted beams versus the normalized thick-
ness d of the gap slabs. The resonant-like behavior of these dependencies can be explained in
the same way as was done for the case of surface waves. If the gap is absent, no leaky waves are
excited and, therefore, the shift of the reﬂected beam is much smaller then the incident beam
width. If we increase the width of the gap separating the medium one and three, we increase
effectively the quality factor for the excitation of guided modes, thus increasing the propagation
distance of such waves and, hence, the lateral shift of the reﬂected beam. For large widths of
the gap, the reﬂected beam spectrum is much wider than the spectrum of the leaky waves and,
as a result, only a small part of the beam energy can be transferred to the guided waves, making
the resulting beam shift small.

Figures 8(c,d) show the dependence of the beam shift on the width of the incident beam. A

change of the width of the incident beam modiﬁes its spectral extent, thus it changes the ratio
of the energy carried by the mirror-like reﬂected and leaky-wave radiated beams.

We have performed direct numerical FDTD simulations of the temporal dynamics for the
excitation of the guided waves in the ﬁve-layer structure. Samples of these results are shown
in Figs. 9(a,b) where two snapshots in time of the electric ﬁeld intensity distribution at the
end of the simulations are given. In particular, Fig. 9(a) shows the excitation of the backward
guided waves. The air gap thickness here was chosen to be l 0/2 in order to decrease the quality
factor of the guided modes and to obtain a better coupling with the radiative modes. The excited
guided wave has a vortex-like structure of the energy ﬂow, as predicted earlier in Ref. [17]. The
structure of the x-component of the instantaneous Poynting vector is shown as a contour plot in
Fig. 10(a). It shows that the energy inside the DNG slab ﬂows in the direction opposite to energy
ﬂow in dielectrics. Figure 10(b) presents the cross-section transverse to the interfaces shown in
Fig. 10(a) at the middle point of the simulation domain. It shows explicitly the negative energy
ﬂow inside the DNG slab waveguide.

Finally, Fig. 9(b) shows the snapshot in time of the distribution of the electric ﬁeld intensity
at the end of the simulation in the case when the excitation of the leaky waves are guided by the
air gaps. The results demonstrate that the electric ﬁeld in this case is mostly concentrated in the
air gaps. This explains the positive energy transfer, and the overall positive shift of the reﬂected
and transmitted beams.

5. Conclusions

We have analyzed the scattering of an obliquely incident Gaussian beam by a multi-layered
structure that includes a double-negative (DNG or left-handed) medium. We have demonstrated
that a rich variety of surface and guided waves supported by these multi-layered structures hav-

ing both double-positive (DPS or right-handed) and DNG media can result in a giant lateral shift
of the beam reﬂected from it. We have emphasized that this effect is due to either the resonant
excitation of surface waves (surface polaritons) at the interface between the conventional DPS
and the unconventional DNG materials, or due to the resonant excitation of guided and leaky
modes in the DNG slabs. For the resonant excitations of guided waves, the reﬂected beam has
a well-deﬁned double-peak structure, where one peak represents the mirror-like reﬂection, and
the second one appears due to a lateral beam shift from the point of the mirror-like reﬂection,
and it is produced by the excited surface waves. The lateral beam shift can be both positive and
negative, depending on the type of the surface waves supported by the structure and excited by
the incoming beam. Many of those predictions hold in the presence of losses in the DNG ma-
terial that has been included in our analysis as well. We have also performed a series of direct
ﬁnite-difference-time-domain numerical simulations to model the temporal dynamics of the
beam scattering in both types of the multi-layered structure guided-wave geometries and have
conﬁrmed the major effects predicted analytically for the time harmonic, stationary problem.

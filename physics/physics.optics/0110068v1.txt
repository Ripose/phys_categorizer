We suggest a novel conceptual approach for describing the properties of waveguides and circuits in
photonic crystals, based on the eﬀective discrete equations that include the long-range interaction
eﬀects. We demonstrate, on the example of sharp waveguide bends, that our approach is very
eﬀective and accurate for the study of bound states and transmission spectra of the photonic-crystal
circuits, and disclose the importance of evanescent modes in their properties.

One of the most promising applications of photonic
crystals is a possibility to create compact integrated op-
tical devices [1], which would be analogous to integrated
circuits in electronics, but operating entirely with light.

Usually,

the properties of photonic crystals and
photonic-crystal waveguides are studied by solving
Maxwell’s equations numerically, and such calculations
are time consuming. Moreover, the numerical approach
does not always provide a good physical insight. The
purpose of this Letter is to suggest a novel approach,
based on the eﬀective discrete equations, for describing
many of the properties of the photonic-crystal waveguides
and circuits, including the example of the transmission
spectra of sharp waveguide bends. The eﬀective discrete
equations we derive below are somewhat analogous to the
Kirchhoﬀ equations for electric circuits. However, in con-
trast to electronics, in photonic crystals both diﬀraction
and interference become important, and thus the result-
ing equations involve the long-range interaction eﬀects.

To introduce our approach, we consider a two-
dimensional (2D) photonic crystal consisting of inﬁnitely
long dielectric rods arranged in the form of a square
lattice with the lattice spacing a. We study the light
propagation in the plane normal to the rods, assuming
that the rods have a radius r0 = 0.18a and the dielec-
tric constant ε0 = 11.56 (this corresponds to GaAs or
Si at the wavelength ∼ 1.55 µm). For the electric ﬁeld
E(~x, t) = e−iωt E(~x | ω) polarized parallel to the rods,
Maxwell’s equations reduce to the eigenvalue problem

which can be solved by the plane-wave method [2]. A
perfect photonic crystal of this type possesses a large
(38%) complete band gap (between ω = 0.303 × 2πc/a
and ω = 0.444 × 2πc/a), and it has been extensively
employed during last few years for the study of bound
states in waveguides and bends [3], transmission of light
through sharp bends [4,5], branches [6] and channel drop
ﬁlters [7], nonlinear localized modes in straight waveg-
uides [8] and perfect photonic crystals [9]. Recently, this
type of photonic crystal with a 90o bent waveguide was
fabricated experimentally in macro-porous silicon with

a = 0.57 µm and a complete band gap at 1.55 µm [10].

To create a waveguide circuit, we introduce a system
of defects and assume, for simplicity, that the defects are
identical rods of the radius rd (with εd) located at the
points ~xm, where m is the index number of the defect
rods. In the photonic crystal with defects the dielectric
constant ε(~x) can be presented as a sum of the periodic
and defect-induced terms, i.e. ε(~x) = εp(~x) + εd(~x) , and,
therefore, Eq. (1) can be written in an integral form

E(~x | ω) =

d2~y G(~x, ~y | ω) εd(~y) E(~y | ω) ,

where G(~x, ~y | ω) is the Green function (see, e.g., [8]).

The integral equation (2) can be solved numerically
in the case of a small number of the defect rods. How-
ever, such calculations become severely restricted by the
current computer facilities as soon as we increase the
number of the defect rods in order to create photonic-
crystal waveguides, waveguide bends, and branches [4–7].
Therefore, our primary goal in this Letter is to develop
a new approximate physical model that would allow the
application of fast numerical techniques combined with a
reasonable accuracy and the further possibility to study
nonlinear photonic crystals and waveguides.

When the defects support monopole modes, a reason-
ably accurate model can be derived by assuming that
the electric ﬁeld inside a defect rod remains constant. In
this case, we can average the electric ﬁeld in the inte-
gral equation (2) over the cross-section of the rods [8,11],
and derive an approximate matrix equation for the am-
plitudes of the electric ﬁeld En(ω) ≡ E(~xn | ω) at the
defect sites,

FIG. 1. Dispersion relation for the 2D photonic-crystal
waveguide (shown in the inset) calculated by the super-cell
method [2] (dashed), and from the approximate equations
(5)–(6) for L=7 (solid) and L=1 (dotted). The gray areas
are the projected band structure of a perfect 2D crystal.

To check the accuracy of the approximate model (3),
ﬁrst we consider a single defect located at the point ~x0.
In this case, Eq. (3) yields J0,0(ωd) = 1/εd, and this
expression deﬁnes the frequency ωd of the defect mode.
For example, applying this approach to the case when we
have a defect created by a single removed rod, we obtain
the frequency ωd = 0.391 × 2πc/a which diﬀers by only
1% from the value ωd = 0.387 × 2πc/a calculated with
the help of the MIT Photonic-Bands numerical code [2].

A single-mode waveguide can be created by removing a
row of rods (see the inset in Fig. 1). Assuming that the
waveguide is straight (Mn,m ≡ Mn−m) and neglecting
the coupling between asunder defect rods (i.e. Mn−m = 0
for all |n − m| > L), we rewrite Eq. (3) in the transfer-
matrix form, ~Fn+1 = ˆT ~Fn, where we introduce the vector
~Fn = { En, En−1, ... , En−2L+1 } and the transfer matrix
ˆT = {Ti,j} with the non-zero elements

for

j = 1, 2, ..., 2L ,

Tj,j+1 = 1 for

j = 1, 2, ..., 2L − 1 .

Solving the eigenvalue problem

ˆT (ω)~Φp = exp{ikp(ω)} ~Φp ,

we can ﬁnd the 2L eigenmodes of the photonic-crystal
waveguide. The eigenmodes with real wavenumbers
kp(ω) correspond to the propagating waveguide modes.
In the waveguide shown in Fig. 1, there exist only two
such modes (we denote them as ~Φ1 and ~Φ2), propagating
in the opposite directions (k1 = −k2 > 0). In Fig. 1 we
plot the dispersion relation k1(ω) found from Eq. (6) for
the nearest-neighbor interaction (L=1) and also taking
into account interaction between seven neighbors (L=7);
we compare the results with those calculated directly by

the super-cell method [2]. As soon as we go beyond the
approximation of the nearest neighbors and take into
account the coupling between several defect rods, Eqs.
(3)–(6) provide very accurate results for the dispersion
characteristics of the photonic-crystal waveguides. We
verify that this conclusion is also valid for multi-mode
waveguides, e.g. those created by removing several rows
of rods.

In addition to the propagating guided modes,
photonic-crystal waveguides there always exist evanes-
cent modes with imaginary kp. These modes, which can-
not be accounted for in the framework of the nearest-
neighbor approximation, remain somewhat “hidden” in
straight waveguides, but they become important in
more elaborated structures such as waveguide bends and
branches. Importantly, our model does take into account
all such eﬀects.

We consider the simplest case of a waveguide bend,
where the evanescent modes manifest themselves in two
diﬀerent ways. First of all, they create localized bound
states in the vicinity of the bend. As was shown in Ref.
[3], in the cases when the waveguide bend can be consid-
ered as a ﬁnite section of a waveguide of diﬀerent type,
the bound states correspond closely to cavity modes ex-
cited in this ﬁnite section. However, such a simpliﬁed
one-dimensional model does not describe correctly more
complicated cases, even the bent waveguide depicted in
Fig. 2 [3]. The situation becomes even more complicated
for the waveguide branches [6]. In contrast, solving Eq.
(3) we can ﬁnd the frequencies and proﬁles of the bound
states excited in an arbitrary complex set of defects. As
an example, in Fig. 2 we plot the proﬁles of two bound
states (cf. Fig. 9 in Ref. [3]). The frequencies of the
modes are found from Eq. (3) with the accuracy of 1.5%.

Additionally, the evanescent modes determine the non-
trivial transmission properties of the waveguide bends
which can also be calculated with the help of our dis-
crete equations. To demonstrate this, we consider a bent

waveguide consisting of two coupled semi-inﬁnite straight
waveguides with a ﬁnite section (an arbitrary complex set
of defects) between them. The ﬁnite section includes a
bend with a safety margin of the straight waveguide at
both ends. We assume that the defect rods inside this
segment are characterized by the index that runs from a
to b, and the amplitudes Em (m = a, ..., b) of the elec-
tric ﬁeld near the sites of the removed rods are all un-
known. We number the guided modes (6) in the following
way: p = 1 corresponds to the mode propagating in the
direction of the waveguide bend (for both ends of the
waveguide), p = 2 corresponds to the mode, propagating
in the opposite direction, p = 3, ..., L + 1 correspond to
the evanescent modes which grow in the direction of the
bend, and p = L + 2, ..., 2L correspond to the evanescent
modes which decay in the direction of the bend. Then,
we can write the incoming and outcoming waves in the
semi-inﬁnite waveguide sections as a superposition of the
guided modes:

for m = b + 1, ..., b + 2L, where λin
are unknown
amplitudes of the evanescent modes growing in the di-
rection of the bend, and t and r are unknown amplitudes
of the transmitted and reﬂected propagating waves. We
take into account that the evanescent modes growing in
the direction from the bend vanish, and assume that the
amplitude of the incoming plane wave ~Φ1 is normalized
to the unity. Now, substituting Eqs. (7)–(8) into Eq. (3),
we obtain a system of linear equations with 2L + b − a + 1
unknown. Solving this system, we ﬁnd the transmission
|t|2 and reﬂection |r|2 coeﬃcients.

In Fig. 3 we present our results for the transmission
spectra of several types of bent waveguides, as in Ref. [4],
where the possibility of high transmission through sharp
bends in photonic-crystal waveguides was ﬁrst demon-
strated. As is clearly seen, Eqs. (3)–(8) provide a very
accurate method for calculating the transmission spectra
of the waveguide bends.

In conclusion, we have suggested a novel conceptual ap-
proach for describing the properties of photonic-crystal
waveguides and circuits, including the transmission spec-
tra of sharp bends. The eﬀective discrete equations we
have introduced here emphasize the important role of the
evanescent modes in the photonic-crystal circuits, and
they can be applied to study more complicated prob-
lems such as transmission in waveguide branches, chan-
nel drop ﬁlters, nonlinear localized modes in nonlinear
waveguides, and so on.

Abstract

We consider a strictly isolated single-mode optical cavity resonating at angular frequency
ω containing atoms whose one-electron level energies are supposed to be: ~ω, 2~ω. . . B~ω,
and m photons. If initially the atoms are in their highest energy state and m = 0, we ﬁnd
that at equilibrium: variance(m)/mean(m) = (B + 1)/6, indicating that the internal ﬁeld
statistics is sub-Poissonian if the number of atomic levels B does not exceed 4. Remarkably,
this result does not depend on the number of atoms, nor on the number of electrons that
each atom incorporates. Our result has application to the statistics of the light emitted by
pulsed lasers and nuclear magnetic resonance. On the mathematical side, the result is based
on the restricted partitions of integers.

Introduction

We consider a single-mode optical cavity containing identical atoms. The number of photons in
the cavity, denoted by m, may be measured at any time t: It suﬃces in principle to quickly re-
move the atoms at that time and introduce an ideal light detector. The photo-count tells us how
many photons were present in the cavity at the time considered. By performing measurements
on a large number of similarly prepared cavities, the probability P (m, t) that some m-value be
found at time t is evaluated. We are particularly interested in the so-called Fano factor, deﬁned
for example in [1]: F (t) ≡ variance(m)/mean(m). In the course of time, the system eventually
reaches a state of equilibrium, in which case P (m, t) and F (t) are time-independent.

If the system is in a state of thermal equilibrium, the photon statistics is, as is well known,
that of Bose-Einstein. In that case, the Fano factor is equal to mean(m) + 1. This situation
occurs when the cavity may exchange energy with a thermal bath (canonical ensemble). This
would also be the case for the strictly isolated cavities (micro-canonical ensemble) considered in
the present paper if the response of the atoms to the ﬁeld were linear. But in general the atomic
response is nonlinear and the photon distribution does not follow the Bose-Einstein statistics.

This may be seen from a simple example. Consider an isolated single-mode cavity resonating
at angular frequency ω and containing two identical (but distinguishable) resonant 2-level atoms.
The atomic ground-state energy is taken as equal to 0 and the upper level energy as equal to
~ω = 1, for brevity. If, initially, the two atoms are in their upper state and the cavity does not
contain any photon, i.e., m(0)=0, the total matter+ﬁeld energy U = 2. Part of the atomic energy
gets converted into photons in the course of time. The fundamental law of Statistical Mechanics

tells us that, once a state of equilibrium has been reached, all the microstates of the isolated
system presently considered are equally likely to occur. The complete list of microstates (ﬁrst
atom state, second atom state, number of photons) reads: (1,1,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,1) and (0,0,2). It
follows from this list that the probabilities of having 0, 1 and 2 photons are proportional to 1,
2 and 1, respectively. This is obviously a non-thermal distribution. In that example, the Fano
factor deﬁned above is F = 1/2. But the mean value of m is equal to 1, so that the Bose-Einstein
distribution would give instead F = 2. Sets of microstates may be obtained similarly for total
energy values U = 0, 1, 2, 3 . . .. When the cavity is in contact with a bath at temperature T , the
probability that the total energy be U is given by the Boltzmann probability law exp(−U/T ).
The end result for the photon statistics is of course Bose-Einstein. Only isolated cavities with a
particular value of the total energy U are presently considered. It is straightforward to generalize
the two 2-level atoms result to any number M of distinguishable 2-level atoms. We ﬁnd that F
remains equal to 1/2. This is a special case (B = 2) of the general result to be derived in the
present paper. The Bose-Einstein statistics would, in that case, give: F = 1 + M/2.

The Fano factor has been evaluated in many papers dealing with laser light, for example
[1, 2]. In lasers, the atoms are driven to their excited state by a pump, and the cavity suﬀers from
some optical loss, perhaps as a result of light transmission through partially reﬂecting mirrors.
It could be thought at ﬁrst that the Fano factor of isolated cavities obtains from the laser theory
result by letting the pumping rate J as well as the optical loss α go to zero. This is not the case,
however, because in the laser system the total (atom + ﬁeld) energy U in the cavity may drift
slowly, no matter how small J and α are. It follows that the variance of m deduced from laser
theories in that limit does not coincide with the present Statistical Mechanical result, applicable
to strictly isolated systems, even if the average value of U is the same in both cases. This point
has been discussed in detail in [3]. Further conceptual details can be found in [4]. The present
theory is nevertheless of practical signiﬁcance. It is applicable to pulsed rather than continuous
electromagnetic generators, as we later discuss.

To summarize, if initially m = 0 and the piece of matter is in its highest energy state, m at
some later time represents the energy subtracted from the piece of matter. The probability that
some m value occurs is proportional to the matter statistical weight (number of distinguishable
conﬁgurations) Wm according to the equal-weight principle of Statistical Mechanics. We there-
fore need only consider the statistical weight of the atomic collection. We will consider ﬁrst the
case of a single atom with level energies 1,2. . . ,B, and subsequently any number, M , of B-level
atoms. Finally, we consider for the sake of illustration a radio-frequency cavity containing M
bismuth nuclei (spin 9/2) immersed in a magnetic ﬁeld. Our general result gives in that case a
Fano factor equal to 11/6.

Our simple and general expression for the Fano factor derives from a property of the number

of restricted partitions of integers.

2 One B-level atom

Consider an atom whose one-electron level energies are 1, 2, . . . , B, with N ≤ B single-spin
electrons. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each level may be occupied by only 0 or 1
electron. The atom energy is greatest when the N electrons occupy the upper states. For some
subtracted energy m the statistical weight Wm is the number p(N, m) of partitions of m into at
most N parts, none of them exceeding B − N . This conclusion is reached by shifting electrons
downward beginning with the bottom one until the speciﬁed energy m is subtracted. Let us
recall that a partition of m is a non-increasing sequence of positive integers summing up to m.
By convention the number of partitions of 0 is 1. It is known [5] that

If the moments of m with respect to the statistical weight Wm are deﬁned as

we have, as it is well known [6],

mn = Pm=0,1,2... mnp(N, m)
Pm=0,1,2... p(N, m)

,

mean(m) = m = h′(1),

variance(m) = m2 − m2 = h′′(1) + h′(1),

where h(q) = ln[g(q)] and primes (double primes) denote ﬁrst (second) derivatives with respect
to the argument.

Since

.

For example, if B = 4, N = 2, a direct examination shows that p(2, m) = 1 if m = 0, 1, 3, 4
and p(2, 2) = 2. Therefore, mean(m) = 2 and variance(m) = 10/6 in agreement with (8). If
the equilibrium ﬁeld is allowed to radiate into free-space the statistics of the emitted photons
is sub-Poissonian (variance less than the mean) when B < 5 and super-Poissonian (variance
exceeding than the mean) when B > 5. The result in (8) was given in [4] without a proof.

3 Any number of B-level atoms

Let now the cavity contain a collection of M atoms labeled by k = 1, 2 . . . , M , with N (k) ≤ B
electrons in atom k. These atoms are supposed to be distinguishable and to be coupled to one
another only through energy exchanges with the cavity ﬁeld.

The photon number m represents the energy subtracted from the atomic collection. The
atomic statistical weight Wm is the sum, for all values of m1, m2, . . . summing up to m, of the
products of the individual statistical weights deﬁned above:

Wm =

X
m1+m2+...+mM =m

p(N (1), m1)p(N (2), m2) . . . p(N (M ), mM ).

(9)

The moments of m may therefore be calculated as

mn = P(m1 + m2 + . . . + mM )np(N (1), m1)p(N (2), m2) . . . p(N (M ), mM )

,

(10)

P p(N (1), m1)p(N (2), m2) . . . p(N (M ), mM )

where the summation is over all non-negative values of m1, m2, · · · , mM .
It follows that the
mean value of m is the sum of the individual atoms means, and that the variance of m is the
sum of the individual atoms variances.

For the B-level atoms considered here, the result (6) gives

mean(m) =

mean(k) =

Therefore, the simple result in (8) holds for any collection of B-level atoms.

4 Application to nuclear magnetic resonance

As is well known, a spin 1/2 charged particle such as an electron immersed in a magnetic ﬁeld
behaves in the same manner as a (one-electron) 2-level atom. This analogy generalizes to spin-s
particles. We may therefore consider, as an example of application of the previous expressions,
an electro-magnetic cavity containing M identical spin-s charged particles. These particles may
If these particles are submitted to a
be distinguished from one another by their locations.
magnetic ﬁeld of appropriate strength, and in appropriate energy units, the energy levels are
−s, −s + 1, · · · , s. In a cold environment only the lowest energy levels are populated. But it
suﬃces to apply the so-called π-radio-frequency pulse to get the highest levels populated. Our
previous result: variance(m)/mean(m) = (B+1)/6 = (s+1)/3 applies once a state of equilibrium
between the particles and the ﬁeld has been reached. It is here supposed that the nuclei natural
relaxation time is much longer than the time required for the particle-ﬁeld equilibrium to be
attained. If the ﬁeld is allowed to radiate into free space, the emitted electro-magnetic pulse is
Poissonian (variance(m) =mean(m)) for spin 2 particles.

Bismuth nuclei were found by Black and Goudsmit in 1927 to have a maximum spin s = 9/2
[7].
It follows that in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld these nuclei exhibit B = 2s + 1 =
10 evenly-spaced energy levels. When located in a radio-frequency cavity (whose resonating
frequency should be in the 100 MHz range for usual magnetic-ﬁeld strengths), the equilibrium
Fano factor reads according to our theory F = (B + 1)/6 = 11/6. Because of their small energy,
radio-frequency photons may be counted only at very low temperatures. It is also at such low
temperatures that long nuclei relaxation times may occur.

JAYNES-CUMMINGS MODEL WITH DEGENERATE ATOMIC LEVELS

Abstract

The Jaynes-Cummings model describing the interaction of a single linearly-
polarized mode of the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld with an isolated two-level
atom is generalized to the case of atomic levels degenerate in the projections of
the angular momenta on the quantization axis, which is a usual case in the exper-
iments. This generalization, like the original model, obtains the explicit solution.
The model is applied to calculate the dependence of the atomic level populations
on the angle between the polarization of cavity ﬁeld mode and that of the laser
excitation pulse in the experiment with one-atom micromaser.

The Jaynes-Cummings model [1] describes the interaction of a single linearly-polarized mode of the quan-
tized electromagnetic ﬁeld with an isolated two-level atom. The full set of states of the system atom+ﬁeld
is

|n, α >= |n > ·|α >,

, n = 0, 1, ..., α = b, c,

where n is the number of photons in the ﬁeld mode, while b and c denote the upper and lower atomic levels
correspondingly. This model is applied successfully to analyse the results of the experiments with one-atom
micromasers (see, e.g., [2]). However, the levels of an isolated atom are degenerate in the projections of
the total elctronic angular momenta on the quantization axis, so that the original Jaynes-Cummings model
becomes, in general, invalid.

Now, let us take into account the degeneracy of atomic levels. Then, the full set of states of the system

becomes

|n, Jα, mα >= |n > ·|Jα, mα >, n = 0, 1, ..., mα = −Jα, ..., Jα, α = b, c,

where Jb and Jc are the values of the total electronic angular momenta of resonant levels, while mb and mc are
their projections on the quantization axis - the cartesian axis Z, which is directed along the polarization vector
of the ﬁeld mode.

The Hamiltonian of the system may be written as

the Hamiltonian (1) becomes

els b and c in the experiment [2] were the Rydberg states of the rubidium atom with the angular mo-
menta Jb = 3/2 and Jc = 3/2 or Jc = 5/2 . The upper level b was excited from the ground state a with
the angular momentum Ja = 1/2 by the linearly-polarized laser pulse. The evolution of the atomic den-
sity matrix under the action of the excitation pulse in the rotating-wave approximation is desribed by the

The atom behaves like a two-level system - the population

nb = cos2 (θ)

oscillates with a single Rabi frequency - only in case when the polarizations of the exciting laser pulse and
of the cavity ﬁeld mode coincide -
ψ = 0 , otherwise the oscillations with more than one Rabi frequencies appear.

So, the Jaynes-Cummings model generalized to the case of the atomic levels degenerate in the projec-
tions of the angular momenta on the quantization axis is a useful tools for the description of the polarization
properties of one-atom micromasers.

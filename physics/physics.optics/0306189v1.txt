Abstract

A model for a non-Kerr cylindrical nematic ﬁber is presented. We
use the multiple scales method to show the possibility of construct-
ing diﬀerent kinds of wavepackets of transverse magnetic (T M ) modes
propagating through the ﬁber. This procedure allows us to generate
diﬀerent hierarchies of nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations (P DEs)
which describe the propagation of optical pulses along the ﬁber. We go
beyond the usual weakly nonlinear limit of a Kerr medium and derive a
complex modiﬁed Korteweg-de Vries equation (cmKdV) which governs
the dynamics for the amplitude of the wavepacket. In this derivation
the dispersion, self-focussing and diﬀraction in the nematic are taken

into account. It is shown that this cmKdV equation has two-parameter
families of bright and dark complex solitons. We show analytically that
under certain conditions, the bright solitons are actually double em-
bedded solitons. We explain why these solitons do not radiate at all,
even though their wavenumbers are contained in the linear spectrum
of the system. We study (numerically and analytically) the stability
of these solitons. Our results show that these embedded solitons are
stable solutions, which is an interesting property since in most systems
the embedded solitons are weakly unstable solutions. Finally, we close
the paper by making comments on the advantages as well as the limita-
tions of our approach, and on further generalizations of the model and
method presented.

1 Introduction

Theoretical studies on the existence of solitons in liquid crystals (LCs) started
in the late sixties and early seventies [1]-[4], and experimental conﬁrmations
were reported subsequently [5]-[8]. In the case of static solitons in LCs, the
molecular conﬁgurations may be obtained from the Lagrange equations derived
from the Helmholtz free energy, whereas for propagating solitons the continu-
ous change in these conﬁgurations makes it necessary to take into account the
damping of the molecular motion. For liquid-crystal waveguides, the nonlin-
earity necessary for the existence of solitons is provided by the coupling with
the optical ﬁeld.

Coupling of the dynamics of the velocity and director ﬁelds in LCs to ex-
ternal optical ﬁelds renders the relevant dynamical equations highly nonlinear,
which makes it possible to have solitary waves of the director ﬁeld with or
without involving the ﬂuid motion. Furthermore, the strong coupling of the
director to light makes any director-wave more easily detectable by optical
methods than it is in isotropic ﬂuids, where only the ﬂow ﬁeld is observable.
Some nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations (P DEs) appearing in the
liquid-crystal theory give rise to exact soliton solutions. These are the Korteweg-
de Vries (KdV ), nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS), and the sine-Gordon (sG)
equations [9]. The KdV equation describes a medium with weak nonlinearity
and weak dispersion, whereas the NLS equation describes situations where
weak nonlinearity and strong dispersion prevail, such as the propagation of
signals in liquid-crystal optical ﬁbers.

Passing continuous laser beams through nematic LCs reveals the existence
of static spatial patterns in cylindrical [10] and planar [11] geometries. The ba-
sic physical mechanism which support these time-independent patterns is the
balance between the nonlinear refraction (self-focussing) and spatial diﬀrac-
tion in the nematic. However, when the propagation of wavepackets, rather
than continuous beams, is considered, a diﬀerent situation occurs. The en-
velope of the wavepacket obeys an NLS equation, which takes into account
self-focussing, dispersion and diﬀraction in the nematic [12], [14], [15]. This
equation has soliton solutions whose speed, time and length scales may be
estimated by using experimentally measured values of the corresponding pa-
rameters [16]. However, the usual analysis of this situation is based on the
assumption that the LC behaves as a Kerr medium and that, consequently,
strong dispersion and weak nonlinearity, at order O(q3), with respect the ﬁeld
amplitude q, should be taken into account As it will be discussed below, q
measures the ratio of the electric-ﬁeld energy density and the elastic-energy
density of the nematic and it is, therefore, a measure of the coupling between
the optical ﬁeld and the ﬂuid. However, although truncating the analysis at
the O(q3) order may be a very reasonable assumption for solid-state optical

3

media, the soft nature of the LCs suggest that the neglect of higher-order
contributions may not necessarily be a good assumption in this case.

Recently, the formation of spatial solitary waves in nematic LCs with at
the light-power level of a few milliwatts has attracted a good deal of interest
[17], [18], [19], [20]. It has been experimentally shown that the nonlinearity of
these media can support solitons in LC line waveguides [21], [22].

The main purpose of the present work is to develop an approach that al-
lows to generate P DEs which describe the propagation of optical pulses in
nematic LC waveguides beyond the weakly nonlinear limit corresponding to
the Kerr medium. More speciﬁcally, we show that to O(q4), and assuming
that attenuation eﬀects are small, the evolution of the amplitude of propagat-
ing transverse-magnetic transverse-magnetic (T M) modes is governed by an
equation with a derivative nonlinearity, which is the complex modiﬁed KdV
(cmKdV ) equation,

see Eq. (32) below.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we introduce a model of a
cylindrical nematic cell and set up basic coupled equations for the orienta-
tional and optical ﬁelds. We formulate an iterative procedure to expand these
equations in terms of the coupling parameter q, which leads to a speciﬁc hi-
erarchy of P DEs. Then, in Sec. 3 we derive dynamical equations governing
the evolution of the amplitude of propagating T M modes up to the order
O(q4). Rescaling the equations, we show that the standard NLS equation is
obtained at order O(q3), and that the equation corresponding to O(q4) is in-
deed the cmKdV equation (1). In Sec. 4, soliton solutions to this equation are
studied. In particular, it is shown that the equation has ordinary bright- and
dark-soliton solutions, and a continuous family of embedded solitons (ESs),
i.e. solitary waves which exist inside the system’s continuous spectrum of lin-
ear waves [23]. In Sec. 5 we discuss why the ESs can exist in Eq. (1) without
emitting any radiation, even though their wave numbers belong to the linear
spectrum. In Sec. 6 we study the stability of the ESs. We conclude the pa-
per in Sec. 7, which summarizes the results and compares them to previously
published ones. We also point out advantages and limitations of our approach,
and discuss possible ways to generalize it.

2 The Model and Basic Equations

We consider a cylindrical waveguide with an isotropic core of radius a, dielectric
constant ǫc and a quiescent nematic LC cladding of radius b. The initial
orientational state is depicted in Fig. 1, where the director ﬁeld obeys the

4

following axial strong-anchoring boundary conditions,

ˆn(r = a, z) = ˆn(r = b, z) =

ez.

An optical beam is launched into the guide and propagates through the LC.
If the ﬁeld is strong enough to exceed the orientation-transition threshold, the
initial conﬁguration is changed by reorienting the director ﬁeld. We assume
that the induced reorientation occurs only occurs in the (r, z) plane, so that

where

Although the incident beam is neither planar nor Gaussian, the normal
modes within the cavity are cylindrical plane waves propagating along the
z axis. In previous works it has been shown that only the T M modes, with
nonzero components Er(r, z, t), Ez(r, z, t) and Hφ(r, z, t) of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld, couple to the reorientation dynamics of the director ﬁeld [14], [12], [24].
As it can be shown that Er(r, z, t) and Ez(r, z, t) may be expressed in terms of
Hφ(r, z, t), below we only describe the dynamics of the component Hφ(r, z, t).
The relevant dynamical equations, which take into account retardation eﬀects,
are given by Eqs. (8) and (9) of Ref. [24], namely,

between the electric-ﬁeld energy density and the elastic-energy density of the
nematic, where K is its elastic constant in the equal constants approximation.
Thus, q2 is a measure of the coupling between the optical ﬁeld and the LC. We
stress that, in writing Eqs. (4) and (5), large diﬀerence between the time scales
of slow reorientation dynamics and rapid variations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
was explicitly taken into account, and as a consequence the time derivatives
of θ were ignored.

When the coupling between the T M mode Hφ(r, z, t) and the reorientation
ﬁeld θ(r, z, t) is negligible (q = 0), the propagating modes are represented by
quasi-planar waves. However, if the nonlinearities in Eq. (4) are taken into
account by considering ﬁnite q, they cause space and time variations of the
ﬁeld Hφ(r, z, t), due to generation of higher-order harmonics which feedback
to the original modes.

We assume that the interaction between the optical ﬁeld and the reori-
entation in the nematic is stronger than in the weakly nonlinear limit (Kerr
medium) which corresponds to q = 1 [12]. Furthermore, in all the analysis
we neglect all the backﬂow eﬀects associated with the reorientation or caused
by external ﬂows [13]. Thus, we solve the coupled equations (4) and (5) by
assuming the following coupled expansions of θ and Hφ in powers of q,

θ = θ(o) + q2

where c.c. stands for the complex conjugate.

The rationale behind this assumption is the following. As indicated in
Eq. (4), the lowest-order coupling between θ and Hφ occurs at order q2, and

6

it is therefore reasonable to expect that higher-order terms will also be even
in q. The ﬁelds θ(n) with n = 0, 1, 2.. are contributions to θ at order n ,
which satisfy the same hard-anchoring homeotropic boundary conditions as
were given above by Eq. (2), θ(x = 1) = θ(x = b/a) = 0. As usual, the
amplitude A(Ξ, T ) in Eqs.

tions to the T M modes from to the higher-order optical harmonics that are
generated by the nonlinearities in Eqs. (5) and (4).

Note, however, that the relation between the parameters q and λ is not
unique. For instance, when the wavepacket is very narrow, this relation is λ = q
and up to O(q3), the expansion leads to the standard nonlinear Schr¨odinger
(NLS) equation for A(Ξ, T ) (which corresponds to the Kerr medium) [25],
[12], [24]. Therefore the model may be generalized in various ways. Since q

Then α = 1/2 represents a wider and α = 2 a narrower wavepacket. Note that
the presence of higher powers of q implies that these higher-order contributions
are smaller than the dominant term in (7), which describes a small-amplitude
narrow wavepacket.

Zero-order solutions for the orientation, with θ(0) = 0, and ﬁrst-order ones,
which gives rise to θ(1)(x), were found in Ref.
[24] by inserting expressions

To study the dynamics beyond the Kerr approximation, we need to calcu-

In spite of its apparent complexity, this linear diﬀerential equation for θ(2)(x)
can be easily solved by imposing the planar strong-anchoring boundary condi-
tions for θ, as explained above. The solution can then be written in terms of
the exponential-integral function, and if the resulting expressions are approx-

While this compact form for θ(2)(x) is suﬃcient for our discussion below, ex-
pressions for the coeﬃcients A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, B0, B1, C0, C1, C2, C3 and
C4 that appear in Eq. (17) are given in Appendix A.

To conclude this section, it is relevant to stress that the above derivation
ignored dissipative loss in the LC medium.
In fact, the physical condition
for the applicability of this assumption is that the propagation distance to
be passed by excitations (solitons) is essentially smaller than a characteristic
dissipative-loss length. This condition can be readily met in situations of
physical relevance.

3 The Envelope Dynamics

We now aim to derive an equation for the envelope A(Ξ, T ) by dint of the same
procedure that was used in Ref.
[12] for the weakly nonlinear case. To this
end, we substitute Eq. (8) into Eq. (10), and identify the Fourier variables

The coeﬃcient n2 is related with the nonlinear diﬀraction index n2 through the
Kn2/ǫ0a2. Similarly, we deﬁne a nonlinear diﬀraction index
expression n2 ≡
ω0Kn3/ǫ0a2; it is
at the next order beyond the Kerr approximation by n3 ≡
proportional to the coeﬃcient in front of the nonlinear term in Eq. (29). Note
that Eq. (27) simply describes a wavepacket in the linear medium, while Eq.
(28) is the well-known NLS equation which gives rise to robust soliton pulses.
The equations corresponding to the orders q2 and q3 are well-known ones, and
they have also been derived and analyzed in Ref. [24]. In the next section we
focus on Eq. (29), which was derived at order q4.

4 Double Embedded Solitons

Equation (29) may be rewritten in a rescaled form by introducing the dimen-
T /T04, where Z04 and T04
sionless variables u
are space and time scales, and A0 is the initial amplitude of the optical pulse.
In terms of these variables, Eq. (29) becomes

where we have deﬁned the dimensionless coeﬃcients ε and γ as

In what follows below, we will consider Eq. (32) in the form of Eq. (1), i.e.,
with ξ and τ replaced by z and t.

Equation (32), or equivalently Eq. (1), reduces to the real modiﬁed Ko-
rteweg de Vries (mKdV ) equation when we restrict u(z, t) to be real, hence
all the real solutions of the mKdV equation, including N-soliton ones, are
also solutions of (1). On the other hand, Eq. (1) also has complex solutions
which include, as it will be discussed below, two-parameter families of bright
and dark complex solitons. Actually, the existence of these complex solutions
of Eq. (1) was pointed out by Ablowitz and Segur as early as 1981 [29]. The
precise form of the bright solitons in the particular case when ε = 6γ was
presented recently by Karpman et al. [30].

In the general case the bright-soliton solutions to Eq. (1) may be found by

substituting a straightforward trial function in this equation,

u(z, t) = A sech

ei(qz+rt).

Condition (36) implies that the bright soliton solution (35) only exists for
ǫγ > 0, which implies that, in the opposite case, the nonlinearity and linear
dispersion cannot be in balance. Moreover, since we have ﬁve free parameters
(35) and only three conditions (36) – (38), these expressions deﬁne
in Eq.
a two-parameter family of bright soliton solutions of Eq.
(1), so that the
following pairs of the parameters can be chosen arbitrarily: (A, r), (w, r),
(A, q), or (w, q). The family includes, as particular cases, the real one-soliton
solutions of the mKdV equation, which are obtained when r = 0.

In a similar way, dark solitons of Eq. (1) can be found by substituting the

u(z, t) = Ad tanh

ei(qd z + rd t).

which are similar to the conditions (36) – (38) for the bright solitons. As in
the bright case, the conditions (40) – (42) permit us to choose freely any of
the following pairs of parameters: (A, r), (w, r), (A, q), or (w, q). Thus, Eqs.
(39)-(42) deﬁne a two-parameter family of dark-soliton solutions of Eq. (1),
Eq. (40) showing that this family only exists if εγ < 0, i.e., exactly in the case
opposite to that in which bright solitons are found.

(42)

(1), the bright family is the most interesting one.

Out of the two families of the above soliton solutions (bright and dark)
of Eq.
In spite of their
similarity to ordinary bright solitons, the bright soliton solutions of Eq. (32)
feature a special property which distinguishes them from ordinary solitary
waves, namely, they are double-embedded solitons. The concept of embedded
solitons (ESs) was formulated, in a general form, in Ref.
It refers to
solitary waves which do not emit radiation, in spite of the fact that the soliton’s
wavenumber (spatial frequency) is embedded in the system’s linear spectrum.
Still earlier, solitons of this type were found in particular models [17], for
instance, in a generalized NLS equation involving a quintic nonlinear term
[31]. Recently, more systems supporting ESs have been found [32] – [40]. To
the best of our knowledge, the existence of ESs has not been reported before
in models of LC media.

[23].

13

So far, the embedded solitons were classiﬁed in two groups, namely, those
which obey NLS-like equations (or systems thereof), and those which are
governed by KdV -like equations. In the former case, an ES has its wavenumber
embedded in the range of wavenumbers permitted to linear waves (as it was
already mentioned above). In the latter case, the velocity of an ES is found
in the range of phase velocities of linear waves. There are, accordingly, two
diﬀerent ways to decide whether a solitary-wave solution to a nonlinear P DE
system is embedded, viz., the wavenumber (WN) and velocity (VE) criteria.

In Ref. [30] it was pointed out that Eq. (1) is a particular case of a more
general NLS-like equation possessing ESs. For this reason, and also in view
(1) for physical applications, it is interesting to
of the signiﬁcance of Eq.
determine if the bright-soliton solutions of Eq. (1) may be ESs.
It should
be noted that Eq. (1) may be regarded as both a KdV -like equation, due
to its similarity to the mKdV one, and an NLS-like equation, because, in
the context of wave propagation in LCs, Eq. (1) in its complex form plays
a role similar to that of the NLS equation, i.e., the one governing evolution
of a slowly varying envelope of a rapidly oscillating wave. Therefore, it may
be possible to apply both criteria, WN and VE ones, to decide if the soliton
solutions of Eq. (1) are ESs.

First, we apply the WN criterion. To this end, we must determine if the
wavenumber of the solution (35) is contained within the range of the wavenum-
bers allowed to linear waves. To identify the intrinsic wavenumber of the so-
lution, we must transform it into the reference frame moving along the time
axis with the reciprocal velocity a, see Eq. (35). The transformation adds a
Doppler term to the soliton’s internal spatial frequency (wavenumber), making
it equal to q + ar. On the other hand, plane-wave solutions to the linearized
version of Eq. (1) in the same reference frame can be sought for as

u(z, t) = exp i [kz

ω(t

az)] ,

−

−

which leads to the following dispersion relation

k(ω) = εω3

aω.

−

(43)

(44)

Since the range in which the function (44) takes its values covers all the real
numbers, including the soliton’s wavenumber q + ar, all the soliton solutions
(35)-(38), are classiﬁed as ESs as per the W N
to Eq.
criterion.

(1), given by Eqs.

Now, we address the question whether these solitons are also embedded
according to the V E criterion. As the evolution variable in Eq. (1) is the
distance z, rather than the time t, it is the reciprocal velocity which determines
if the moving solutions are embedded according to the V E criterion. Thus,
we should ﬁnd out if the reciprocal velocity of the soliton (35), given by the

14

parameter a, is contained within the range of the reciprocal velocities permitted
to linear waves. The dispersion relation (44) implies that the reciprocal phase
velocities of the linear waves (in the reference frame moving along with the
soliton) are given by

k
ω

=

a + εω2,

−

(45)

while the reciprocal velocity of the soliton proper is, obviously, zero in the
same reference frame. Obviously, the expression (45) takes the value zero if
aε is positive, hence the soliton solutions given by Eqs. (35) – (38) are ESs
according to the V E criterion provided that aε > 0. As these solitons are
also embedded according to the W N criterion, we call them double-embedded
solitons. On the other hand, when aε < 0, the soliton solutions of Eq. (1) are
only embedded with respect to the W N criterion, but not as per the V E one,
therefore in this case we apply the term single-embedded solitons.

5 Radiation Inhibition and Continuity of the

Embedded Solitons

As in any other system with ESs, the fact that the solitons do not emit
radiation despite being embedded in the linear spectrum should be explained.
Since the wavenumber q + ar of the soliton solution (35) is contained in the
linear spectrum deﬁned by the dispersion relation (44), a resonance of the
soliton is expected with the linear waves whose frequencies satisfy the condition

Moreover, when aε > 0 the soliton’s reciprocal velocity a coincides with the
reciprocal phase velocities (εω2) of two linear waves whose frequencies satisfy
the condition

q + ar = εω3

aω.

−

a = εω2,

(46)

(47)

consequently one could also expect the soliton to resonate with these waves.
Diﬀerent explanations for the absence of resonant radiation in other systems
which support ESs were proposed [34], [41]. However, an explanation for the
radiationless character of the ESs in Eq. (1) has not been presented.

Another unexpected property of the same ESs in Eq. (1) is the fact that
they exist in a continuous family. In most cases, ESs are isolated solutions;
usually they do not appear in families, although examples of continuous fam-
ilies of ESs are known too, for instance, in a ﬁfth-order KdV equation [35].
It is also necessary to explain why Eq. (1) has a two-parameter family of the
ES solutions.

15

As we show below, the radiationless character of the ESs in Eq. (1) is the
consequence of a special balance between the linear and the nonlinear terms
of this equation. To understand how these terms interact, it will be helpful to
separate their eﬀects by considering the following linear driven equation,

where the source is built of a solution u0(z, t) to Eq. (1). It is clear that the
same function u0 is also a solution to Eq. (46).

We now deﬁne the double Fourier transform of u(z, t),

is the source in Eq. (48).

To understand the mechanism of the cancellation of the emission of ra-

example with

F0(z, t) = A sech

(cid:27)

At ﬁrst sight, this expression seems to imply that a resonance with the ra-
diation waves should occur for frequencies at which the denominator, which
is a third-order polynomial in ω, vanishes, which is actually tantamount to
Eq.(46). Moreover, if q = r = 0, the same argument shows that a resonance
at the frequencies deﬁned by Eq. (47) should be expected. Observe, however,

16

that the numerator on the right-hand side of (53) also contains a third-order
polynomial in ω. Consequently, if the two polynomials happen to coincide,
they will cancel each other, which also implies the cancellation of the resonant
generation of the radiation modes. Equating the coeﬃcients in front of powers
of ω in the two polynomials in (53), we obtain three equations which, after
some manipulations, take the precise forms of Eqs. (36) – (38). Thus, these
three equations are the necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the mutual can-
cellation of the two polynomials in Eq. (53). This explains why the forcing
term F0(z, t) of the form (52) does not generate any radiation, provided that
the parameters A, a, w, q and r satisfy Eqs. (36) – (38). Furthermore, observe
the expression (53)
that the polynomial that appears in the numerator of
contains the nonlinear coeﬃcient γ, while the polynomial in the denominator
contains the dispersion coeﬃcient ε. Consequently, the cancellation between
these two polynomials is a result of the balance between the nonlinearity and
dispersion in Eq. (1). Finally, if the forcing term in Eq. (50) is taken in the
exact form (51), rather than in the simpliﬁed form of Eq. (52), it is easy to
check that the prediction for the cancellation of the radiation emission will be
the same.

In the case of the full equation (1), the same cancellation argument explains

why an initial condition of the form

u(z = 0, t) = A sech

(54)

t
w

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

eirt

does not radiate at the frequencies deﬁned by Eqs. (46) and (47) if A and w
do not satisfy Eq. (36). On the other hand, if A and w this condition, we
expect the resonances to occur. In the next section, we will verify numerically
that this indeed the case.

To close this section, it is relevant to stress that the cancellation of the
two polynomials in Eq.
(53) imposes only three conditions, while the so-
lution (35) involves ﬁve parameters. Therefore, the cancellation conditions
do not uniquely determine the soliton parameters, which explains why the
soliton solution (35)-(38) involves two arbitrary parameters, thus deﬁning a
two-parameter continuous family of the ESs.

6 Stability of the Embedded Solitons

In this section we will study the stability of the bright-soliton solutions of Eq.
(1). As it was explained in Sec. 4, these solitons may be either single-embedded
or double-embedded, depending on the sign of the parameter combination aε.

17

In the following we will separately consider the cases of positive and negative
aε.

We begin by considering a single-embedded soliton of Eq. (1), setting ε = 1
and γ = 6 [these values were chosen as they correspond to those at which the
related Hirota equation [42], which is connected to Eq. (1) by the Galilean
transform [30], is an exactly integrable one [43]]. We start with the following
values of the soliton parameters

as =

qs =

(55)

(56)

(57)

(58)

(59)

These values satisfy the conditions (36) – (38), and therefore they characterize
an exact bright soliton of the form (35). Since asε < 0, this soliton is a single-
embedded one (i.e., it is embedded solely according to the WN criterion).

To test stability of this soliton, we consider an initial condition of the form

u (z = 0, t) = A0 sech

exp (ir0t) ,

(60)

t
w0 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

−

where w0 = ws and r0 = rs, but A0 is slightly diﬀerent from As. If we give A0
a value 0.815, which is larger than As, the numerical solution of Eq. (1) shows
that the pulse moves to the right along the temporal axis with a reciprocal
0.58, which is slightly lower than as, and the pulse’s ampli-
velocity equal to
tude evolves as shown in the upper curve of Fig. 2. The observation that the
reciprocal velocity of the perturbed pulse is lower than as is consistent with
Eq. (37), which indicates that a should decrease if A is increased. Figure 2
(the upper curve) shows that the pulse’s amplitude stabilizes and approaches
an equilibrium value close to A = 0.84. The temporal proﬁle of the pulse
at z = 50 is displayed in Fig. 3. It shows a small-amplitude radiation wave
emitted by the trailing edge of the pulse. The frequency composition of this
tiny radiation wave can be determined by calculating the Fourier transform
(F T ) of the radiation contained in the interval 40
168. The insert in
Fig. 3 shows the power spectrum (i.e., the square of the F T amplitude) of

and ν 2 = 0.12. These peaks are close to the resonant frequencies (ν =

[cf. Eq. (46)] and the partial resonance condition [40]

qs + asrs = εω3

−

−

(61)

(62)

These radiation peaks imply that the perturbed pulse emits radiation according
to the way the soliton’s wavenumber is embedded in the spectrum of linear
waves.

If we now consider an initial condition of the form (60), with wo = ws,
ro = rs and Ao = 0.765 < As, the behavior of the perturbed pulse is similar.
In this case the amplitude evolves as shown in the lower curve of Fig. 2 where
we can see that the pulse’s amplitude approaches an equilibrium value close
0.42, which
to A = 0.74. The reciprocal velocity of the perturbed pulse is
is slightly higher than as. This change is consistent with Eq.
(37), which
indicates that a should increase if A is diminished.

−

The two curves shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate that the single-embedded
soliton solutions of Eq.
(1) are stable. This is an interesting result, since
usually ESs display a weak (nonlinear) one-sided instability [34]. In fact, the
complete stability of the ESs in Eq. (1) may be expected, due to the fact that
in this case we are dealing with a continuous two-parameter family of the ESs,
while in most other systems ESs are isolated solutions, which explains their
nonlinear instability.

Figure 2 also shows that if the amplitude of one of the single-embedded
solitons of Eq. (1) is slightly increased, the perturbed soliton stabilizes itself
at an even higher amplitude. On the contrary, if the soliton’s amplitude is
slightly decreased, the perturbed soliton stabilizes at a still lower amplitude.
This behavior can be better understood if we analyze the evolution of the
perturbed solitons of Eq. (1) by means of the averaged variational technique
introduced by Anderson [44], which is one of the approximately analytical
methods used successfully in nonlinear optics [45] – [51], see also a recent
review [52].

In order to apply the variational technique, we start with the ansatz of the

ordinary form,

Q(z) + R(z) t + P (z) t2

not given, as they will not be needed in what follows.

We now resort to search for ﬁxed points of Eqs. (66) – (71), which are

stationary solutions of the form

A′ = W ′ = R ′ = P ′ = P = 0,

When we insert these conditions into Eqs. (66)-(71), we ﬁnd that fn = 0 (for
n = 1, ..., 5) and consequently, the following relations are obtained

Equation (75) is the variational counterpart of Eq. (36), and the expressions
for a and q coincide exactly with those in (37) and (38). On the other hand,
Eq. (78) applies not only to stationary solutions, but to general dynamical
equations as well, with variable A(z) and W (z), as it expresses the variational
version of the exact conservation law (which is simply the energy conservation
in the case of nonlinear optics [52]).

Equation (78) is plotted by thin curves, corresponding to two diﬀerent
initial conditions, in Fig. 4. This ﬁgure also shows plots (the bold curve) of
Eq. (75), corresponding to ε = 1 and γ = 6. This diagram helps to understand
why the soliton [characterized by the parameters (55) – (59) and marked by
point E on the bold curve in Fig. 4], if perturbed by increasing or decreasing
its initial amplitude, stabilizes itself, as was observed in Fig. 2.

We take, as the initial perturbed soliton, the one corresponding to point 1
in Fig. 4. It has the same width as the unperturbed soliton at point E, but a
larger amplitude,

A1 = 0.815 > 0.790 = AE.

(79)

According to Eq. (78), the perturbed pulse must evolve sliding along the thin
curve passing through point 1. The thin curve intersects the equilibrium bold
curve at point 2, which is therefore a ﬁxed point. Within the framework of the
variational approximation proper, the trajectory may perform some oscillations
in a vicinity of this ﬁxed point; however, if eﬀective loss due to the emission of
small amounts of radiation by the perturbed soliton (which was observed above
in direct simulations) is taken into regard, the trajectory will be attracted to
the ﬁxed point, and will eventually end up being trapped at this point, thus
implying the stabilization of the soliton very close to point 2, which has the
value of the amplitude 0.840.

Similarly, starting at the initial condition corresponding to point 3, the
soliton will slide along the thin line until it gets stuck at the stable ﬁxed
point 4. As the amplitude corresponding to point 4 is 0.740, the origin of
the stabilization process observed in direct simulations displayed in the lower
curve of Fig. 2 is now clear.

So far we considered relaxation of perturbed single-embedded soliton. Now
we proceed to the stability of double-embedded ones. To this end, we set

These values satisfy the conditions (36) – (38), therefore they deﬁne an exact
bright soliton of the form (35). Since adε > 0, this soliton is a double-embedded
one. We perturb it by taking an initial condition of the form (60) with w0 = wd,
r0 = rd, and A0 = 0.815 > Ad.

The numerical solution of Eq. (1) corresponding to this initial condition
shows that the perturbed pulse moves along the temporal axis with a reciprocal
velocity equal to 0.07, which is slightly lower than ad (this lower velocity is
(37)). Simultaneously, the pulse’s amplitude oscillates
consistent with Eq.
as shown in the upper curve of Fig. 5. This ﬁgure again shows a trend
of the perturbed pulse to stabilize. However, in this case (with the double-
embedded soliton) the stabilization process is slower, and it is necessary to pass
a greater distance (along the z axis) to observe the damping of the amplitude
oscillations. The upper curve of Fig. 5 shows that the pulse’s amplitude
eventually approaches an equilibrium value close to 0.84.

The trailing edge of the perturbed double-embedded soliton emits a tiny
radiation wavetrain whose frequency components can be determined by cal-
culating the F T of the radiation contained in the interval 45
109 (for
z = 200). The spectrum obtained in this way is shown in Fig. 6. In this ﬁgure
0.046
two peaks are seen. The bigger one corresponds to the frequency ν =
(ω =
0.289), which corresponds to the negative solution of Eq. ( 47), and
therefore it is a consequence of the resonance of the perturbed soliton with
a linear wave whose phase velocity is equal to the soliton’s velocity. On the
other hand, the smaller radiation peak is located at ν = 0.078 (ω = 0.490),
which is very near to the only real root (ω = 1/2) of the resonance condition

(85)

Therefore, the latter peak is due to the fact that the soliton’s wavenumber
qd + ad rd is contained in the range of wavenumbers permitted to linear waves.

22

As the larger radiation peak (the one at ν =

0.046) exists due to the
fact that the soliton is embedded according to the VE criterion, one could
assume that in this case (i.e., when a double-embedded soliton is perturbed)
the radiation emitted by the pulse is mainly due to the VE embedding of the
soliton. However, such a conclusion would be wrong. The left radiation peak
in Fig. 6 actually has a larger amplitude because the F T of the complete
solution is slightly shifted to the left (as a consequence of r0 being positive),
and it is this shift which enhances the left radiation peak.

−

−

rd =

To verify the latter point, one can consider a slightly diﬀerent initial con-
48/5, and
dition, characterized by the parameters A0 = 0.815, w0 = wd =
1/4. As in this case r0 is negative, the F T of the complete solu-
r0 =
tion will be shifted to the right, and this shift will enhance the right radiation
peak. At the insert in Fig. 6 we show the spectrum of the radiation emitted
in this case by the perturbed double-embedded soliton (for z = 100). As ex-
pected, in this case the radiation peak due to the wavenumber embedding of
the soliton (i.e., the right peak) is much higher than the one existing due to
the velocity embedding (the very small peak on the left). We thus conclude
that both embeddings, WN and VE, are important to explain the emission of
radiation by perturbed double-embedded solitons.

p

If we now consider an initial pulse of the form (60) with w0 = wd, r0 = rd
and A0 = 0.765 < Ad, the numerical solution of Eq. (1) shows that the pulse’s
amplitude again performs a damped oscillatory behavior, as shown in the lower
curve of Fig. 5. In this case, the pulse’s amplitude approaches an equilibrium
value close to 0.74.

7 Concluding Remarks

In this work, using the multiple scales method, we have derived a model for the
propagation of a wavepacket of T M modes along a cylindrical liquid-crystal
waveguide beyond the usual weakly nonlinear limit of the Kerr medium. In this
case, the amplitude of the wavepacket obeys a nonlinear equation, (1) or (32),
which exhibits a derivative nonlinearity. This complex modiﬁed KdV equation
gives rise to the two-parameter families of bright, Eqs. (35) – (38), and dark,
Eqs. (39) – (42), solitons. The bright-soliton solutions of Eq. (1) are embedded
solitons (ESs) (or sometimes double-embedded ones), i.e., they do not emit
any radiation, in spite of the fact that their wavenumbers (and sometimes their
velocities too) fall into the linear spectrum of the system. We have shown that
the physical nature of the existence of the ESs inside the continuous spectrum
is the balance between the dispersion and nonlinearity in Eq. (1). Moreover, it
was concluded that these ESs are completely stable solutions, while, in most
previously considered models, they are weakly unstable. It was observed that

23

perturbed single-embedded solitons relax to a new equilibrium state faster than
double-embedded ones.

The coupled expansions for θ and Hφ in powers of q, that were introduced
in Sec. 2, can be extended to higher orders. This leads to nonlinear equations
with the quintic i.e., O(q5), nonlinearity. Investigation of the corresponding
model is currently in progress. Also, as discussed in Sec. 3, up to the order
O(q4) considered here, the same procedure to construct narrower (α = 2) or
wider (α = 1/2) wavepackets of T M modes can also be carried out.

Another possible generalization of our model, not dealt with here, is a
possibility to take into account hydrodynamic ﬂows beyond the Kerr-medium
approximation, that will inevitably couple to the reorientation dynamics of
the liquid crystal. Actually, the inclusion of the ﬂow is unavoidable owing
to the ﬂuid nature of the system. However, the consideration of the hydro-
dynamical part of the system substantially complicates the problem. Some
eﬀects produced by this generalization were considered, at the level of the
NLS approximation, i.e., at order O(q3), in Ref. [13].

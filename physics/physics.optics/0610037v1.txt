We propose a full-vectorial numerical study of far-ﬁeld radiation patterns in coherent
anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy. We emphasis the particular role of the
Raman depolarisation ratio of the observed medium and show how it modiﬁes the radiation
pattern of thin objects.
Keywords: CARS, coherent microscopy, CARS electromagnetics modelling.

1 Introduction

Predicted in 1965 by Maker and Therune [1], coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering
(CARS) was ﬁrst used in microscopy as a contrast mechanism in 1982 by Duncan et al. [2].
It has revealed to be a powerful non-invasive tool to probe the chemical composition of
microscopic objects. Since its renewal in 1999 under collinear conﬁguration [3], it has been
considered as valuable to image biological samples. CARS is a third-order nonlinear eﬀect
in which two beams at optical pulsations ωp and ωs mix in the studied medium to give
rise to the so-called anti-Stokes radiation at pulsation ωas = 2ωp − ωs. When ωp − ωs
equals a vibrational pulsation of the medium, the anti-Stokes signal is enhanced and vi-
brational contrast is thus generated. CARS is classically described by the third order
nonlinear tensor χ(3). As a coherent process, CARS eﬃcient generation is very sensitive
to the phase-mismatch ∆k = 2kp − ks. Several geometries have been proposed to relax

the phase-matching condition, among them collinear geometry under tight focusing condi-
tion [4] and BOXCARS geometry [5], the former being the most implemented nowadays.
To provide good axial and lateral resolutions, microscope objectives with high numerical
apertures (NA) are commonly used [6, 7, 8].

As a coherent process, CARS generation is very sensitive to both size and shape of
imaged objects.
Image formation process in CARS microscopy is thus narrowly bound
to the far-ﬁeld CARS radiation pattern of studied samples, so that images are not the
simple convolution of the object with the microscope point spread function as in ﬂuores-
cence microscopy. Moreover, under tight focusing condition, the commonly used paraxial
approximation breaks. Hashimoto and al. [9] ﬁrst derived the coherent transfer function
and the optical transfer function of a CARS microscope under scalar assumption. Based
on the framework developed by Richards and Wolf to treat the problem of tightly focused
beams [10], Volkmer and al. solved the problem introducing Hertzian dipoles [11] and later,
Cheng and al. used a Green’s function formalism [12]. These two studies took into account
(i) the vectorial nature of the pump and Stokes exciting ﬁelds and (ii) both the size and
the shape of the imaged object. However, assumptions on the exciting ﬁelds polarisation
near the objective focus were made. In particular, their longitudinal components (along
the optical axis) were neglected, neglecting in the same time the longitudinal component
of the nonlinear polarisation responsible for CARS radiation.

As we will show in this paper, the relative amplitude of this component is a function
of (i) the way the incident beams are focused into the sample and (ii) the Raman depo-
larisation ratio (ρR) of the probed medium.
In other circonstances, this ratio is found
to play an important role in elimination of the non-speciﬁc signal in polarisation CARS
spectroscopy [13, 14] and microscopy [15]. The nonlinear polarisation acting as a source
for the anti-Stokes CARS generation, introducing its longitudinal component potentially
aﬀects the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern of the studied sample.

This paper starts with some CARS basics and expressions of the induced nonlinear po-
larisation as a function of the Raman depolarisation ratio are derived. In a second part, the
computation method used in this paper is brieﬂy described, acompanied by a description
of the simulated physical situation. Then, exciting ﬁelds and nonlinear polarisations are
computed for diﬀerent focusing conditions and diﬀerent values for the Raman depolarisa-
tion ratio. Finally, the inﬂuence of these parameters on far-ﬁeld CARS radiation patterns,
for diﬀerent classes of objects, are presented.

2 Raman and CARS background

CARS is governed by the third order nonlinear tensor χ(3). It is the superposition of a
vibrational resonant term, referred as χ(3)
R and an electronic nonresonant term denoted

2

χ(3)
N R [16]. At exact vibrational resonance, the former is a purely imaginary number while
the latter can be considered as real [17]. In the case of an isotropic medium, χ(3) depends
on three independent components χ(3)
xyyx. Typical CARS experiments
involving only two input beams, the pump ﬁeld is frequency-degenerated. As a consequence,
the number of its independent components reduces to two so that [18]

where subscripts i, j, k and l refer to cartesian coordinates x, y or z, and δ refers to the

Kronecker delta function.

The link between the two components χ(3)

xyyx is not straightforward and it is
useful to connect their values with experimental data obtained with spontaneous Raman
spectroscopy. It is well known that in spontaneous Raman spectroscopy, a depolarisation
ratio ρR can be deﬁned. It refers to the faculty of the probed Raman line to depolarise the
polarised excitation beam. It is deﬁned by

where Is(k) and Is(⊥) refer to Stokes intensity respectively polarised parallel and per-
pendicular to the excitation polarisation. ρR is speciﬁc to both the probed Raman line and
the excitation conditions so that it can be expressed as a function of intrinsic parameters
of the Raman line [19]

where α, γs and γa respectively refer to the isotropy, and the symmetric and anti-
symmetric parts of the anisotropy of the usual Raman tensor. By analogy, ¯α, ¯γs and ¯γa
coeﬃcents can be deﬁned for CARS scattering [19].

In the same way, a CARS depolarisation ratio ρCARS is deﬁned by [19]

ρCARS is simply related to the ¯α, ¯γs and ¯γa coeﬃcients by the relation

In the case when no direct electronic absorption occurs, ¯γa equals zero and both ¯α and
¯γs are real. Moreover ¯α and ¯γs can be safely identiﬁed to their spontaneous counterparts
(ie ¯α = α and ¯γs = γs) [20]. Therefore ρCARS can be assumed to equal ρR. When α equals
zero, the Raman line is told to be depolarised and ρCARS equals 0.75. In the opposite case
(γs = 0), the Raman line is totally polarised so that ρCARS equals 0. Finally, under the
assumption of no electronic absorption from the medium, ρCARS lies between 0 and 0.75.

The local third-order nonlinear polarisation induced, at the point r, by the pump and

the Stokes ﬁelds Ep and Es is expressed by

P(3)(r, −ωas) = χ(3)(−ωas; ωp, ωp, −ωs)Ep(r, ωp) : Ep(r, ωp) : E∗

where ωp, ωs and ωas are the respective angular frequencies of the pump, Stokes and
anti-Stokes ﬁelds, the symbol ∗ is used for the complex conjugation and the symbol : indi-
cates tensorial product. This nonlinear polarisation is the source of the anti-Stokes ﬁeld.

3 Computing method and simulated physical situa-

tion

We have investigated the eﬀects of tightly focused excitation beams on CARS generation
with a fully vectorial model. The full description of this model can be found in refer-
ence [22]. For convenience, we brieﬂy sum up its main features. It bases on the framework
developped by Richards and Wolf [10] to treat cases when the paraxial approximation
breaks. Exciting pump and Stokes beams are assumed to be gaussian and are described as

4

a superposition of plane waves that are focused through a high numerical aperture (NA)
microscope objective. The ﬁnite size of the back aperture of the objective was also taken
into account via a parameter β. First proposed by Hess et al. [23], it equals the ratio of
the back aperture radius r0 to the half width at half maximum (HWHM) σ of the gaussian
incident beams. The resultant electric ﬁelds Ep and Es, considered as vectorial, are then
computed in the vicinity of the focal plane. They induce dipoles in the active medium
(ie the medium emitting CARS radiation), which orientation, phase and strenght are de-
termined by the mean of Eq.(7). These dipoles act as sources for CARS radiation, which
far-ﬁeld radiation pattern is ﬁnally computed.

CARS generation is studied when the whole vectorial components of the electric ﬁelds
Ep and Es are taken into account in the active medium, which is assumed to be isotropic so
that Eq.(1) holds. As shown on Figure 1, the incident pump and Stokes beam (associated
respectively to electric ﬁelds Ep and Es) are focused in the active medium through a
microscope objective (NA=1.2 in water). They are supposed to follow a gaussian spatial
distribution, to propagate along the z -axis and to be linearly polarised along the x -axis
(blue arrows on Figure 1) so that they are polarised along the x - and z -axes (the component
along the y-axis vanishes following [10]) in the vicinity of the focal plane. The higher the
angle θ (see Figure 1), and hence the numerical aperture, the stronger the ﬁelds components
along the z -axis. The induced third order nonlinear polarisations along x - and z -axes equal

The pump and Stokes beams wavelengths are assumed to be respectively 750 nm and
830 nm. These values match most of the recent CARS microscopy experiments, where

near infrared (NIR) lasers are used [24]. Such wavelengths prevent most active media from
one and two-photon electronic absorption, so that identiﬁcation of ρCARS to ρR holds and
Eq.(6) is valid. Therefore, P (3)

Given χ(3)

xxyy, P (3)

z (r) are now functions of r, and ρR only. Their dependence
on r relies on the Epx, Epz , Esx and Esz ﬁeld maps while ρR only depends on the active
medium.

Eventually, throughout this paper, we assume no refractive index mismatch between
the active medium and its environment (although it has been recently shown that refrac-
tive index mismatch can distort CARS radiation pattern [25]) while the active medium
dispersion is assumed to be negligible (ie n(ωp) = n(ωs) = n(ωas) = 1.33).

4 Mapping the components of the nonlinear polarisa-

tion

As shown by Eqs.(11) and (12), the polarisations P (3)
z (r) tightly depend on (i)
the spatial distribution of the ﬁelds components Epx, Epz, Esx and Esz and (ii) the depo-
larisation ratio ρR. We will be, ﬁrst, interested in the behaviour of the exciting beams near
the focal plane. Then, we will describe the induced nonlinear polarisation as a function of
the focusing conditions and the depolarisation ratio ρR of the active medium.

x (r) and P (3)

4.1 Exciting ﬁelds

Given the high numerical aperture of the objective, the exciting beams are diﬀraction-
limited in the vicinity of the focal plane, following an Airy pattern. The spatial distri-
bution of the ﬁelds components Epx, Epz , Esx and Esz only varies with the parameter β.
As schematized on Figure 1, for any value of β, the depolarisation of the incident electric
ﬁelds is maximal in the (xz )-plane and null in the (yz )-plane, so that both the pump and
Stokes exciting ﬁelds along the z -component are stronger in the former plane than in the
latter. Consequently, for clarity, the study of the exciting ﬁelds (and a fortiori the induced
nonlinear polarisation) will be restricted to the (xz )-plane (although it is computed every-
where).

6

Following Ref. [10], the exciting ﬁelds are, excepted in some particular planes, ellipti-
cally polarised near the focus. However, throughout this part, we will only be interested
in the amplitudes of the Epx, Epz , Esx and Esz components of the ﬁelds, as computed in
Ref. [22]. The spatial distribution of the Epx and Epz components amplitude of the pump
exciting ﬁeld, near the focal plane, for diﬀerent values of β are depicted in Figure 2. The Epz
component is rigorously null in the (yz )-plane, in agreement with Richards and Wolf [10].
Moreover, it is antisymmetric with respect to the focal point (Epz (r) = E∗
pz (−r)). When
β varies from 0.1 (a,d) to 1 (c,f), the tightness of the focusing decreases so that both the
lateral and axial dimension of the focal volume increases (this eﬀect is prevailing along the
axial dimension). In parallel, the axial component Epz gets lower. Such a behaviour can
be easily explained by the “ﬁlling” of the objective back aperture by the incident pump
beam. When β equals 0.1, the incident pump beam overﬁlls the microscope back aperture,
so that it can be considered as a plane wave. On the contrary, when β equals 1, it underﬁlls
the objective back aperture. β equalling 0.5 (b,e) can be considered as realistic when the
incident beam matches the objective back aperture, what is fulﬁlled in most experiments.
The same conclusions can be drawn to the Stokes exciting ﬁeld.

Figure 2: normalised x- (a-c) and (d-f) z -component amplitude maps of the pump exciting ﬁeld
in the vicinity of the focal plane. The paprameter β equals 0.1 (a,d), 0.5 (b,e), and 1 (c,f). For
each value of β, the amplitude of each component is normalised relative to the maximum of the
total amplitude of the pump exciting ﬁeld.

4.2 Nonlinear polarisations

As shown previously, the parameter β inﬂuences the exciting ﬁelds spatial distribution,
and, therefore, the induced nonlinear polarisation. Furthermore, the observed medium it-
self inﬂuences the nonlinear polarisation via the Raman depolarisation ratio ρR.

To study the inﬂuence of the observed active medium, we have considered three values
for ρR (0, 0.33 and 0.75). When ρR equals 0, the Raman line is told to be totally polarised.
Indeed, from Eqs.11 and 12, and the symbol · denoting the complex scalar product, the
induced nonlinear polarisation is expressed by

P(3)(r) = 2χ(3)

xxyy (Ep · Es) Ep

(13)

so that the induced nonlinear polarisation is oriented in the exciting pump ﬁeld direc-
tion. ρR equalling 0.33 corresponds to a midly polarised Raman line, where χ(3)
xyyx.
Eventually, in the case where ρR equals 0.75, the Raman line is depolarised. Following
Eqs.(11) and (12), a modiﬁcation of the ρR value aﬀects the respective contributions of the
Epx, Epz , Esx and Esz ﬁelds to the x - and z -components of the induced nonlinear polarisa-
tion. To make comparison between cases where ρR varies, it is necessary to normalise the
nonlinear polarisation distribution maps for each value of ρR.

xxyy = χ(3)

To fully understand the normalisation procedure, it is important to note that, at the
focus, the pump and Stokes exciting ﬁelds are only polarised along the x -axis, ie Epz and
Esz are rigorously null. Thus, following Eqs.(11) and (12), the induced nonlinear polarisa-
tion is oriented along the x -axis too, so that at this point, it does not depend on ρR.

Therefore, the expressions of the normalised components P (3)

x norm(r) and P (3)

z norm(r) are

given by

In the vicinity of the focal plane, the Esx amplitude being often stronger than the Esz

This decay is accompanied by a deformation of the P (3)

with two regular side lobes (Figure 3d), it exhibits four lobes (Figure 3e) and is ﬁnally
butterﬂy-like-shaped (Figure 3f).

in the vicinity of the focal plane for β = 0.5. The depolarisation ratio ρR equals 0 (a,d), 0.33
(b,e), and 0.75 (c,f). For each value of ρR, the amplitude of each component is normalised relative
to the amplitude of the nonlinear polarisation at the focus.

To illustrate the inﬂuence of β on the induced nonlinear polarisation, on Figure 4 are

be noted that in the case where incident plane waves are focused on the sample (smallest
value of β), ρR has only little inﬂuence on the induced nonlinear polarisation (Figure 4a).
However, this inﬂuence gets stronger as β grows (Figures 4b and 4c), although exciting
ﬁelds intensity maps (see Figure 2) exhibits only few modiﬁcation.

5 Consequences on CARS far-ﬁeld radiation patterns

The previous study has shown the dependency of the spatial evolution of the nonlinear
induced polarisation to both the parameter β and the Raman depolarisation ratio. Of
course, as a coherent process, CARS generation is very sensitive to changes to the nonlin-
ear polarisation. We show, in this part, how far-ﬁeld radiation paterns are modiﬁed with
ρR. As depicted in Figure 4, the nonlinear polarisation only slightly changes with ρR when
the incident exciting beams behave as plane waves (β = 0.1). Therefore, the inﬂuence of
the Raman depolarisation ratio to CARS radiation patterns has only been achieved for
β equalling 0.5 (the case where β equals 1 seems to us quite far from usual experimental
conditions).

Two kinds of objects have been investigated: thick and thin objects. The ﬁrst class is
predicted to only radiate in the forward (same direction of propagation as exicitng beams)
direction while the second class also radiates in the epi direction (opposite direction of
propagation to exciting beams) [12]. Of course, ﬁne features of these patterns depend on
the exact shape of the objects. Following Figure 3, the nonlinear polarisation is appreciable
in the focal plane only in a 1µm × 1µm wide square. For this reason, we ﬁnd it relevant to
assign this transverse dimension to both objects. They are taken as parallepipeds which
axial extent (along the z -axis) can be varied. The z -component of the nonlinear polarisa-
tion being rigorously null at the exact focus, much smaller objects could not experience any

10

modiﬁcation of their radiation pattern with changing ρR. On the contrary, larger objects
have their emitting area limited by the size of the excitation volume.

To simplify the problem, we will ﬁrst neglect the nonresonant part of the χ(3) tensor.
In a second part, we will take into account this contribution and show how it modiﬁes the
radiation patterns.

5.1 Purely resonant sample

Neglecting the nonresonant part of χ(3), we start with a 500nm thick object. Its forward
radiation patterns, in the reciprocal space (kx,ky), are displayed on Figure 5, for ρR lying
between 0 (a) and 0.75 (c). In this case, the Raman depolarisation ratio has little eﬀect on
the far-ﬁeld CARS radiation pattern. The only feature to be noted is the slightly decreas-
ing divergence of the anti-Stokes beam in the (yz )-plane as ρR increases.

Figure 5: Far-ﬁeld radiation pattern in the reciprocal space (kx,ky) from a thick-shaped object
(1µm × 1µm, 500nm thick) centered in the (xy)-plane when ρR equals 0 (a,d), 0.33 (b,e) and
0.75 (c,f), for β = 0.5. Each diagram corresponds to forward-emitted signal. k0 = 2π/λ. Each
radiation pattern is normalised.

The forward and epi radiation patterns of a slice-shaped object, for various values of
ρR, in the (xz )-plane and in the reciprocal space (kx,ky) are shown on Figures 6 and 7.
The object is now an inﬁnitely thin slice of dipoles. It is morphologically identical to bi-
ological membranes found in cells. Following Figure 6, the radiation pattern tends to be
symmmetrical when ρR approaches 0.75 (Figure 6c). Reminding previous results obtained
for the induced nonlinear polarisation (Figure 3), the observed symmetry conveys the x -
orientation of the dipoles. Further information is drawn from Figure 7. First, as in the
case of the thick medium, a very slight change in the forwardly-emitted anti-Stokes beam
divergence is observed (Figure 7a-c). Then, a more important change in the divergence of
the epi-emitted anti-Stokes beam occurs in the (xy)-plane (Figure 7d-f). Contrarly to the
case of the forwardly-emitted beam, the divergence increases with ρR. Figure 8 displays the
ratio of forward to epi-collected intensity as a function of the forward-collection NA (noted

11

F/E ratio). The epi-collection NA is supposed to be constant and to equal the excitation
NA, ie 1.2, and the forward-collected intensity is normalised relative to the epi-collected
intensity. Naturally, for any value of ρR, the F/E ratio is an increasing function of the
forward-collection NA. Moreover, for any value of the forward-collection NA, the higher
the ρR value, the smaller the F/E ratio. A further analysis shows a relative variation of
the F/E ratio lying between 26% and 36% when ρR varies from 0 to 0.75. It lies around
26% for low NA (typically less than 0.3). For commonly used 0.5 NA condensors, it equals
28% and when the collection is insured by another high NA objective (1.2 in water for
example), it reaches 35%.

Inﬂuence of the nonresonant part

The previous investigation presented the advantage to physically highlight the main mod-
iﬁcations of the raditaion pattern with the parameter ρR. However, it failed to depict a
realistic CARS experiment as it neglected the nonresonant part χ(3)
N R of the nonlinear ten-
sor. To take it into account, we have considered the previous “thin” object, located in the
(xy)-plane, whose third order nonlinear polarisation is now given by

P(3)(r) = a · P(3)(r, ρR = 1/3) + (1 − a) · P(3)(r, ρR = 0) · exp(i π/2)

(18)

where P(3)(r, ρR) is deﬁned by its x - and z -components in Eqs.11 and 12 and a is a

weighting coeﬃcient.

P(3)(r, ρR = 1/3) stands for the nonresonant contribution while P(3)(r, ρR = 0) stands
for the resonant contribution (note the π/2 dephasing, with respect to the nonresonant
contribution, at resonance). ρR = 0 was chosen for the resonant contribution since it ex-
hibits the strongest F/E asymmetry.

Figure 7: Far-ﬁeld radiation pattern in the reciprocal space (kx,ky) from a slice-shaped object
(1µm × 1µm) located in the (xy)-plane when ρR equals 0 (a,d), 0.33 (b,e) and 0.75 (c,f), for
β = 0.5. (a-c) forward-emitted signal (F); (d-f) epi-emitted signal (E). k0 = 2π/λ. For each value
of ρR, each radiation pattern is normalised relative to the forward intensity at (kx = 0,ky = 0).

Starting with only the resonant part (a = 0), the nonresonant part was increased from
a tenth of the resonant part (a = 1/11) to twice (a = 2/3). The intensity ratii F/E, for
these values of the nonresonant part (NR), as a function of the numerical aperture of the
forward collection are plotted on Figure 9. As expected, the epi and forward radiation
patterns of this object come closer to those of a “purely nonresonant object” (ie which Ra-
man depolarisation ratio equals 1/3) with increasing contribution of the nonresonant part.
The nonresonant part thus attenuates the slight diﬀerences observed in radiation patterns
for changing values of the Raman depolarisation ratio. This is also true for objects with
various shapes and Raman depolarisation ratii.

In biological samples, where the imaged samples are surrounded by solvent such as
water, we predict (for thin objects) that the forward radiation pattern is governed by the
Raman depolarisation 1/3 of the nonresonant surrounding medium while the epi radiation
pattern is driven by both the Raman depolarisation ratio of the object and the relative
strength of its nonresonant part.

6 Conclusion

Through this paper, a further investigation of far-ﬁeld CARS radiation patterns under
tight focusing conditions has been lead through a full-vectorial study. It has revealed the
conjoined role of focusing conditions (through the parameter β) and the Raman depolar-
isation ratio ρR of the studied medium, in addition of those, already known, of the size
and shape of imaged objects. While the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern of thick object is not
aﬀected by changes in value of β and ρR, those of thin objects are slightly modiﬁed, con-
cerning both the anti-Stokes beam divergence and the ratio of epi to forward-generated
power. Such eﬀects cannot be seen when neglecting the longitudinal components of the
exciting ﬁelds. However, they might be only observable for strong Raman lines (such as
the relative nonresonant part is weak) which is not always the case, specially when working
with biological samples. In most cases, this study validates the treatment of the problem
previously proposed by Cheng and al. [12]. However, in the case of thin objects, it brings
some corrections. Such objects are encountered when imaging biological samples, cellular
membranes being a few nanometers thick.

 Numerical aperture of the forward collection 

Figure 8: Forward on epi detected intensity ratio (F/E ratio) as a function of the numerical
aperture of the forward collection for ρR equalling 0 (black), 0.33 (red) and 0.75 (blue). For each
value of ρR, the ratio is normalised with respect to the epi-emitted signal intensity collected with
a 1.2 NA objective.

We have restricted the analysis to the case of isotropic media, excited with collinearly
polarised exciting beams. Furthermore, the non-resonant surrounding solvent or matrix
has been neglected in the computations but its eﬀect can be easily predicted from the
nonresonant contribution analysis (see section 5.2). The situation is far more complex
when taking into account the anisotropy of studied media as well as the possible ellipticity

of the exciting beams polarisations.
It can be, of course, modelled, following the same
electromagnetic treatment. For the case of electronically resonant CARS [26], the Raman
depolarisation ratio no longer lies between 0 and 0.75 and varies on a larger range [20], so
that the situation must be reexamined very carefully.

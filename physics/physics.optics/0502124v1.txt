We analyze the time reversal of waves in a turbulent medium using the parabolic Markovian
model. We prove that the time reversal resolution can be a nonlinear function of the wavelength
and independent of the aperture. We establish a duality relation between the turbulence-induced
wave spread and the time-reversal resolution which can be viewed as an uncertainty inequality for
random media. The inequality becomes an equality when the wave structure function is Gaussian.

Introduction

Time reversal is the process of recording the sig-
nal from a remote source, time-reversing and back-
propagating it to retrofocus around the source. Time
reversal of acoustic waves has been demonstrated
to hold exciting technological potentials in subwave-
length focusing, dispersion compensation, communi-
cations,
imaging, remote-sensing and target detec-
tion in unknown environments ( see [1] and references
therein). The same should hold for the electromag-
netic waves as well. Time reversal of electromagnetic
waves is closely related to optical phase conjugation
(OPC) which used to be limited to monochromatic
waves. With the advent of experimental techniques,
time reversal of high frequency EM waves hold diverse
potential applications including real-time adaptive op-
tics, laser resonators, high-power laser systems, opti-
cal communication and information processing, im-
age transmission, spatial and temporal ﬁltering, spec-
troscopy etc [1].

Time reversal refocusing is the result of the time-
reversal invariance of the wave equations, acoustic or
electromagnetic, in time invariant media. The sur-
prising and important fact is that the refocal spot
in a richly scattering medium is typically smaller
than that in the homogeneous medium. That is, the
time reversal resolution is enhanced rather than ham-
pered by the inhomogeneities of the medium. This
sub-diﬀraction-limit retrofocusing is sometimes called
superresolution and in certain regimes has been ex-
plained mathematically by using radiative transfer
equations.

In the previous experimental, numerical or theoret-
ical results the superresolution comes as a linear func-

tion of the wavelength but independent of the aper-
ture. In this letter we show that in fractal media the
resolution can be a superlinear (between linear and
quadratic) function of the wavelength and at the same
time independent of the aperture. The lowest achiev-
able refocal spot size in this nonlinear regime is on the
order of the smallest scale of the medium ﬂuctuations.
Below the inner scale the resolution is diﬀraction-
limited while above the outer scale it is the previ-
ously reported aperture-independent enhanced reso-
lution [1, 2].
We will

focus our analysis on the widely used
parabolic Markovian model for waves in atmospheric
turbulence [6]. Neglecting the depolarization ef-
fect let us write the forward propagating wave ﬁeld
E at the carrier wave number k as E(z, x) =

For this model of propagation we will prove an un-
certainty inequality where the conjugate quantities are
the forward wave spread and the time-reversal reso-
lution. The inequality becomes an equality when the
wave structure function is Gaussian. This also helps
illustrating an experimentally observed, close relation
between the time reversal resolution and the correla-
tion length of the scattered wave ﬁeld prior to time
reversal [1].

Time reversal process

In the time reversal procedure, a source Ψ0(x)
located at z = L emits a signal with the carrier
wavenumber k toward the time reversal mirror (TRM)
of aperture A located at z = 0 through a turbulent
medium. The transmitted ﬁeld is captured and time
reversed at the TRM and then sent back toward the
source point through the same turbulent medium, see
Figure 1.

The time-reversed, back-propagated wave ﬁeld at

z = L can be expressed as

Here we have used the fact that time reversing of the

The Wigner distribution W satisﬁes a closed form
equation, the Wigner-Moyal equation [4], and for the
Markovian model its moments also satisfy closed form
equations. In particular, the mean ﬁeld equation is

pendent of the aperture, has a superlinear dependence
on the wavelength in the inertial range. Moreover, the
resolution is enhanced as the distance L and random
inhomogeneities (C∗) increase. This eﬀect can be ex-
plained by the notion of turbulence-induced aperture
which enlarges as L and C∗ increase because the TRM
is now able to capture signals initially propagating in
the more oblique directions (see more on this below).
To recover the linear law previously reported in [2],
let us consider the situation where ρtr = O(γ) and

3

ρtr ∼

γλ(D0L)−1/2.

Hence the linear law prevails in the sub-inertial range.

Turbulence-induced aperture and duality

Intuitively speaking, the turbulence-induced aper-
ture is closely related to how a wave is spread in the
course of propagation through the turbulent medium.
A quantitative estimation can be given by analyzing
the spread of wave energy.

Let us calculate the mean energy density in

Discussion

In summary, we have shown for the parabolic
Markovian model that, ﬁrst, the time reversal reso-
lution can be aperture independent and depend on
the wavelength in a nonlinear way. This is due to
the self-similar nature of the media. Second, we prove
an uncertainty inequality for random media where the
conjugate variables are the forward wave spread and
the time-reversal resolution. The equality is attained
when the wave structure function Ttr is Gaussian.

The preceding analysis has been carried out for a
narrow-band signal. Because of the linearity of the
equation a wide-band signal u0(t, x) can be decom-
posed into frequency components each of which can
be analyzed as above and then resynthesized. The
mean retrofocused signal can be calculated as

from which it follows that the turbulence-induced
spread in time is given by convolution with a Gaus-
sian kernel because Ttr is Gaussian in k, see (11).
The Gaussian kernel has a oﬀset-x-depending variance

Our results above have been limited to the mean
value of the time-reversed retrofocused ﬁeld. Its sec-
ond or higher moments can be determined from those
of the Wigner distribution which are not exactly solv-
able. However, the mean ﬁeld is suﬃcient for de-
termining all the higher moments in case of self-
averaging. Self-averaging occurs, for example, when
the narrow-band beam width in the transverse direc-
tions is large compared to the correlation length of
the random medium or when the signal is wide-band
[1]. The former case has been analyzed extensively in
the literature (see [4] and references therein) and there
arise several canonical radiative transfer equations as
the self-averaging scaling limits. The latter case of
wide-band signals has only been studied for the one-
dimensional medium where the issue of spatial focus-
ing does not arise, see [3]. In the near-self-averaging
regime the second moment of the Wigner distribution
can be calculated and will be reported elsewhere.

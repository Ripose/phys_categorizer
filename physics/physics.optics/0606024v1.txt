We develop an amended ray optics description for reﬂection at the curved dielectric interfaces of optical mi-
croresonators which improves the agreement with wave optics by about one order of magnitude. The corrections
are separated into two contributions of similar magnitude, corresponding to ray displacement in independent
quantum phase space directions, which can be identiﬁed with Fresnel ﬁltering and the Goos-H¨anchen shift,
respectively. Hence we unify two effects which only have been studied separately in the past.

Over the recent years it has become feasible to design opti-
cal microresonators that conﬁne photons by means of dielec-
tric interfaces into a small spatial region not larger than a few
micrometers [1, 2, 3]. Two promising lines of research are the
ampliﬁcation of photons by stimulated emission in active me-
dia, which yields lasing action [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11],
and the generation and trapping of single photons which can
be used as carriers of quantum information [12]. These ap-
plications require integration of several components and in-
terfacing with electronics, which are best realized in two-
dimensional resonator geometries where the main in- and
out-coupling directions are conﬁned to a plane, and can
be selected via the (asymmetric) resonator geometry. Fur-
thermore, because of the requirements of mode selection,
these applications favor microresonators of mesoscopic di-
mensions, with size parameters kL = O(100) − O(1000)
(where L is the linear size, k = 2π/λ is the wavenum-
ber and λ is the wavelength) which quickly puts these sys-
tems out of the reach of numerical simulations. On the other
hand, ray-optics predictions of the intricate resonator modes
[4, 6, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] can deviate substantially from
experimental observations [5, 7] and theoretical predictions
[5, 11, 15, 16].

The purpose of this paper is to develop an amended ray
optics (ARO) description which still idealizes beams as rays,
but incorporates corrections of the origin and propagation di-
rection of the reﬂected ray. We identify these corrections
by utilizing quantum-phase space representations of the in-
cident and reﬂected beam [18] and relate them to the recently
discovered Fresnel ﬁltering effect [19] and the long-known
Goos-H¨anchen shift [20]. These two effects have only been
discussed separately in the past (for applications to microres-
onators see, e.g., Refs. [5, 11, 21, 22]), and their complemen-
tary nature has not been realized. Moreover, their uniform
analysis for all angles of incidence is known to pose consid-

FIG. 1: (Color online) Left panel: Gaussian beam reﬂected from a
curved dielectric interface (kR = 100) separating regions of refrac-
tive index n0 = 1 and n = 0.667. Light regions indicate high wave
intensity. The angle of incidence χ0 = 42◦ is close to the critical
angle χ′ = 41.8◦. Conventional ray optics predicts that the beam
is specularly reﬂected at the point of incidence.
In this paper we
use phase-space representations to obtain a more accurate reﬂection
law, which accounts for (i) the Goos-H¨anchen shift (GHS) ∆φ of the
reﬂection point along the interface and (ii) the increase ∆χ of the
reﬂection angle due to Fresnel ﬁltering. Both effects change the far-
ﬁeld radiation direction θ (see the right panel, which exaggerates the
corrections in order to clarify the notation). For the parameters in the
left panel, ∆φ ≈ 7◦ and ∆χ ≈ 1◦ (see Fig. 3), resulting in a cor-
rected ray which nicely reproduces the observed radiation direction.

beam reﬂected from a constantly curved dielectric interface,
we ﬁnd that compared to conventional ray optics, the resulting
ARO improves the agreement of the far-ﬁeld radiation charac-
teristics with wave optics by about one order of magnitude.

Conventional ray optics assumes that beams have well-
deﬁned propagation directions and a precise point of impact
on a sharp dielectric interface, and predicts that an incident
beam is reﬂected specularly and locally at the interface [26].
In two dimensions, deviations from ray optics at curved inter-
faces are apparent already at inspection of wave patterns such
as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1, where the incident beam
propagates from right to left. The wave pattern reveals that the
reﬂected beam originates from a displaced position and prop-
agates into a different direction than predicted by ray optics.

We choose a coordinate system with origin at the center of
the circle of curvature (see the right panel of Fig. 1). This cir-
cle has the same radius of curvature R as the dielectric inter-
face and touches it tangentially at the point of incidence. The
incident beam propagates into negative x direction. For the
comparison of wave optics to ray optics it is convenient to pa-
rameterize the rays by Birkhoff coordinates (φ, sin χ), where
φ parameterizes the polar angle of the ray’s intersection point
with the interface, while R sin χ is the impact parameter of the
ray, where χ is its angle of incidence. In this two-dimensional
phase space, ray optics locates the incident and reﬂected rays
in Fig. 1 both at the same point φ = φ0, sin χ = sin χ0, where
furthermore φ0 = χ0 for the present case that the incident ray
is oriented into negative x direction.

the reﬂected beam. The displacement into φ direction can be related
the Goos-H¨anchen shift, while the displacement into sin χ direction
is the consequence of Fresnel ﬁltering.

In order to analyze the exact wave pattern in the phase space
of Birkhoff coordinates we utilize Husimi representations in
the near ﬁeld of the dielectric interface. These Husimi func-
tions are obtained by overlapping the incoming and reﬂected
beam at the interface with a minimum uncertainty wave packet
centered around (φ, sin χ) [18],

The plan of this paper is as follows. We ﬁrst quantify the
corrections to conventional ray optics by phase-space repre-
sentations of the wave in the near ﬁeld of the interface. Then
we incorporate these corrections into an ARO. Finally, we test
the ARO by its predictions for the far-ﬁeld radiation charac-
teristics.

The Husimi phase-space representations of the wave pat-
tern of Fig. 1 is shown in Fig. 2. The width w = pπ/kR of
the incident Gaussian beam is chosen such that it yields an op-
timal approximation of a classical ray with comparable uncer-
tainties in the propagation direction and the point of impact.

This results in the almost-circular phase-space density in the
left panel. The location of the maximal phase-space density
corresponds well with the ray-optics prediction (χ0, sin χ0),
indicated by the cross +. The phase-space representation of
the reﬂected beam is shown in the right panel. Clearly the po-
sition (φmax, sin χmax) of the maximal phase-space weight of
the reﬂected beam is displaced from the ray-optics prediction,
as had to be expected from the inspection of the wave pattern
in Fig. 1.

The displacement in sin χ direction can be explained by
Fresnel ﬁltering, which was introduced by Tureci and Stone
[5, 19]: A realistic beam has an uncertainty & 1/(kRw) of its
propagation direction which results in a spreading of the angle
of incidence. The angle of incidence is further spread because
of the curvature of the interface over the focal width Rw. The
Fresnel reﬂection coefﬁcient displays an angular dependence
which favors the reﬂection of wave components with a larger
angle of incidence. This increases the beam’s angle of reﬂec-
tion, by an amount which we identify with the displacement

∆χ = χmax − χ0.

(6)

The displacement into φ direction can be interpreted as a
Goos-H¨anchen shift (GHS), ﬁrst discovered for planar inter-
faces in 1947 [20] (for recent works see Refs. [11, 27, 28, 29,
30]). This shift arises from the penetration of the evanescent
wave into the optically thinner medium [23, 24]. We identify
the resulting lateral displacement of the reﬂection point along
the physical interface with

∆φ = φmax − φ0.

(7)

The angle-of-incidence dependence of ∆φ and ∆χ is
shown in Fig. 3. Both corrections are most pronounced around
the critical angle of incidence χ′ ≈ 41.8◦, and are sizeable
effects even for rather large values of kR. Beyond the criti-
cal angle, ∆φ approaches the classical result for the GHS by

ﬂection χ > χ′ at a planar interface.

ARO consists in propagation of the reﬂected beam with
point of reﬂection given by φARO = φ0 + ∆φ and angle of re-
ﬂection given by χARO = χ0 +∆χ, resulting in a propagation
direction

θARO = φ0 + χ0 + ∆φ + ∆χ

(8)

(see the right panel of Fig. 1). Note that the corrections ∆φ
and ∆χ both have been determined in the near ﬁeld of the
interface [see Eqs. (6,7)]. Hence, within the idealization of
beams by rays, ARO agrees exactly with wave optics in the
near ﬁeld of the interface. The question is then whether the
ARO ray parameters deliver accurate predictions also in the
far ﬁeld (where the beam may encounter another optical com-
ponent or a detector). Hence, we now test the accuracy of
ARO by examination of its predictions for the far-ﬁeld radia-
tion characteristics.

Figure 4 assesses these predictions for the wave pattern of
Fig. 1 by means of Husimi phase-space representations of the
incident and reﬂected beam in the far ﬁeld of the interface,

In the far ﬁeld, the phase-space coordinate φ coincides with
the propagation direction θ, while sin χ is still related to

the Husimi representations ˜H± are given by Eq. (9). The diagonal

the impact parameter R sin χ (this coordinate is preserved
because of angular-momentum conservation with respect to
the center of the circle of curvature). The incident beam
propagating into negative-x direction is thus represented by
phase space coordinates (φ, sin χ) = (0, sin χ0). Ray-optics
predicts that the reﬂected beam has phase-space coordinates
(φ, sin χ) = (θRO, sin χ0), where θRO = φ0 + χ0, while
ARO predicts that the reﬂected beam is located at (φ, sin χ) =
(θARO, sin χARO). The position ( ˜φmax, sin ˜χmax) of the max-
imal phase-space density of the reﬂected beam in the far ﬁeld
(right panel of Fig. 4) indeed corresponds well to the ARO
prediction (indicated by ×), but deviates distinctively from
the ray-optics prediction (indicated by +).

In Fig. 5 the far-ﬁeld radiation direction θ is analyzed as a
function of the angle of incidence. One of the curves is the
deviation ∆θRO = ˜φmax − θRO of the observed radiation
direction from the prediction of conventional ray optics. For
kR = 100, the maximal deviation is ≈ 12.5◦ and occurs about
4◦ below the critical angle of incidence. The plot also shows
the deviation of ARO, ∆θARO = ∆θRO−∆φ−∆χ . It is seen
that ARO improves the agreement to 2◦ close to the critical
angle and agrees even better away from it. For larger size
parameters kR = 400, the maximal disagreement between
ray optics and wave optics drops to ≈ 3.5◦ and occurs at about
1◦ below the critical angle of incidence. The ARO prediction
agrees within 0.3◦ around the critical angle, and the agreement
is almost perfect away from it.

To summarize, we developed a systematically amended
ray-optics description of the reﬂection of Gaussian beams
from the curved dielectric interfaces of optical microres-
onators. This description incorporates the Goos-H¨anchen shift
of the reﬂection point along the interface and the Fresnel-
ﬁltering enhancement of the angle of reﬂection. The cor-
rections were determined by analysis of exact wave-optical
beams in a phase space where one coordinate is associated
with the point of incidence or reﬂection along the interface,
while the other one is related to the angle of incidence or re-
ﬂection, respectively. Fresnel ﬁltering and the Goos-H¨anchen
effect displace the reﬂected beam along independent phase-

space directions. Hence, these displacements in principle ex-
haust all possibilities of amending ray optics while still keep-
ing the basic assumption of propagation along straight lines in
optically homogeneous media.

Amended ray optics is applicable to microresonators with
smooth boundaries where the dimensionless radius of cur-
vature kR is large, which is realized in most experiments.
This includes the popular examples of multipole deforma-
tions [4, 5, 6, 13, 14, 15, 17] or stadium geometries [7, 8, 9].
Complementary techniques exist to describe the diffraction of
beams at sharp corners where formally kR = 0 [32]; see Ref.
[16] for an application to hexagonally shaped resonators [2].
It remains to be seen whether both techniques can be inter-
laced to describe geometries which combine both curved in-
terfaces and sharp corners [10, 11]; moreover, whether both
techniques can be uniﬁed in the challenging regime of a local
curvature with kR = O(1).

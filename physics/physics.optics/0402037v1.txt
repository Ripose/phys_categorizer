Abstract. The Bruggeman formalism is implemented to estimate the refractive index of an
isotropic, dielectric, homogenized composite medium (HCM). Invoking the well–known Hashin–
Shtrikman bounds, we demonstrate that the group velocity in certain HCMs can exceed the group
velocities in their component materials. Such HCMs should therefore be considered as metamate-
rials.

Introduction

By deﬁnition, metamaterials exhibit behavior which (i) either their component materials do not
exhibit (ii) or is enhanced relative to exhibition in the component materials [1]. Many types of
metamaterials may be conceptualized through the process of homogenization [2, 3, 4], paving the
way for their realization. For example, a homogenized composite medium (HCM) may be envisaged
which supports the propagation of a Voigt wave (which is a planar wave whose amplitude varies
linearly with propagation distance), although such waves cannot propagate through its component
materials [5, 6].

In this communication, we explore the enhancement of group velocity which may be achieved
through homogenization. Sølna and Milton recently considered this issue, by estimating the relative
permittivity of a HCM as the volume–weighted sum of the relative permittivities of the component
materials [7]. But that estimation is applicable only for planar composite materials such as super-
lattices of thin ﬁlms, and not to the more commonly encountered particulate composite materials
[2, 3, 4]. In the following analysis, we implement the well–established Bruggeman formalism [4]
to calculate the eﬀective refractive index of an isotropic dielectric HCM. Thereby, we demonstrate
that metamaterials which support group velocities exceeding those in their component materials
may be realized as particulate composite materials.

2 Analysis

Consider a composite material containing materials labeled a and b, with refractive indexes na
and nb, respectively. The component materials are envisioned as random distributions of spherical
particles. Provided that the diameters of these particles are small compared with electromagnetic
wavelengths, homogenization techniques may be applied to estimate the eﬀective refractive index
of the HCM.

In particular, the well–established Bruggeman homogenization formalism [2, 4] — which may
— leads to the

whose solution yields nBr as the estimated refractive index of the HCM. Here, fa and fb = 1 − fa
are the volume fractions of the component materials. In the following, both component materials
are assumed to have negligible dissipation in the frequency range of interest.

The group velocity of a wavepacket propagating through the HCM is given as [10]

vBr =

c
nBr(ω) + ω dnBr
dω

,

(cid:12)
ω(kavg)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
where vBr is evaluated at the angular frequency ω = ω(kavg), with kavg being the average wavenum-
(cid:12)
ber of the wavepacket, and c is the speed of light in free space. Similarly, the respective group
velocities in component materials a and b are given by

vℓ =

ω(kavg)

dω (cid:12)

We proceed to establish upper and lower bounds on vBr, in terms of na and nb. In particular, we
demonstrate that the inequalities

vBr > vℓ ,

(ℓ = a, b)

can be satisﬁed for certain values of na ≥ 1, nb ≥ 1, dna

dω > 0, and dnb

dω > 0.

provided that the dispersive term dna

dω is suﬃciently small.

3 Numerical results

Let us illustrate the phenomenon represented by the inequalities (4) by means of a speciﬁc numerical
example. Consider a particulate composite material at a particular value ω0 of ω. At the chosen
angular frequency, let na = 5, nb = 1.2, dna
= 5.5/ω0. Signiﬁcantly,
dω
material a has a high refractive index but low dispersion in the neighbourhood of ω0, whereas high
dispersion in material b is combined with a low refractive index.

The Bruggeman estimate of the refractive index of the HCM, namely nBr, is plotted as a function
of the volume fraction fa in ﬁgure 1. Also shown are the upper and lower Hashin–Shtrikman bounds,
nU and nL, on nBr, as well as the parameters δa and δb. The Bruggeman estimate adheres closely
to the lower bound nL at low values of fa, whereas at high values of fa the diﬀerence between nBr
and its upper bound nU becomes marginal. The observed agreement between nBr and nL at low
fa reﬂects the fact that the lower Hashin–Shtrikman bound is equivalent to the Maxwell Garnett
estimate of the refractive index of the HCM arising from spherical particles of material a embedded
in the host material b [4]. The Maxwell Garnett estimate is only valid then at low values of fa. As
the volume fraction becomes increasingly small, the Bruggeman estimate (nBr) and the Maxwell
Garnett estimate (low fa value of nL) converge on nb. In a similar manner, the agreement between
nBr and nU at high values of fa is indicative of the fact that the upper Hashin–Shtrikman bound
is equivalent to the Maxwell Garnett estimate of the refractive index of the HCM arising from
spherical particles made of material b embedded in host material a; the Maxwell Garnett estimate
then holds only at high values of fa. In the limit fa → 0, the coeﬃcients δa → 0 and δb → 1; while
δa → 1 and δb → 0 as fa → 1.

The corresponding group velocities va, vb and vBr are plotted as functions of fa in ﬁgure 2. The
upper and lower bounds on vBr as given by vU and vL, respectively, are also displayed. Clearly, we
have vBr > va and vBr > vb for fa > 0.67.

The inequalities (4) hold only over a relatively small range of parameter values. For example,
the phase space in which the inequalities (4) are satisﬁed is illustrated in ﬁgure 3 for na = 5,
dna
= 0.5/ω0 and fa = 0.8. With these relationships ﬁxed for the component material a, we

4 Concluding remarks

We conclude that the group velocity in an isotropic, dielectric, particulate composite material — as
estimated via the Bruggeman homogenization formalism — can exceed the group velocities in its
component materials. This metamaterial characteristic may be achieved through homogenizing (i) a
component material a with high refractive index and low dispersion with (ii) a component material
b with low refractive index and high dispersion. Neither anomalous dispersion nor an explicit
frequency–dependent model of the refractive index (unlike Ref. [7]) is required to demonstrate this
characteristic.

Improved estimates of HCM group velocity may be achieved through the implementation of
homogenization approaches which take into better account the distributional statististics of the
). In
component materials (e.g., the strong–permittivity–ﬂuctuation theory approach TK81, M03
particular, the eﬀects of coherent scattering losses — which are neglected in the present study —
may well result in a moderation of the group velocity. Such studies are currently being undertaken,
especially in light of the recent emergence of metamaterials wherein the phase velocity and the
time–averaged Poynting vector are oppositely directed LMW03

Abstract

The existence of phase resonances in obliquely illuminated, perfectly conducting com-

pound gratings is investigated. The diﬀraction problem of a p-polarized plane wave im-

pinging on the structure is solved using the modal approach. The results show that even

under oblique illumination, where no symmetry is imposed by the incident ﬁeld, there

are resonant wavelengths that are clearly associated with a certain degree of symmetry in

the phase distribution of the magnetic ﬁeld inside the cavities. New conﬁgurations of this

phase distribution take place, that were not allowed under normal incidence conditions.

It was found that the interior ﬁeld is intensiﬁed in the resonances, and the specularly

reﬂected eﬃciency is maximized.

In particular, this eﬃciency is optimized for Littrow

mount.

INTRODUCTION

It is well known that diﬀerent kinds of resonances can be found in metallic corrugated

structures: surface plasmon polariton excitations (SPP), surface shape resonances (SSR)

and phase resonances (PR). SPPs are excited in inﬁnite metallic gratings when illuminated

by p-polarized light [1]. This excitation is accompanied by a signiﬁcant power absorption

[2, 3], and consequently it produces a sudden change in the eﬃciency curves of the reﬂected

orders. For a given period and material of the grating, and for a ﬁxed angle of incidence,

the excitation of a SPP is produced for a particular wavelength at which one of the

diﬀracted orders propagates parallel to the surface, and therefore, the electric ﬁeld near the

surface is intensiﬁed. This phenomenon is particularly important when the corrugations

are shallow. The SSRs, on the other hand, appear when the depth of the grooves is

increased: the eigenmodes of each cavity can be excited, producing interesting resonant

eﬀects such as ﬁeld enhancement inside the corrugations [4]-[6]. Contrary to the SPP

excitations, these resonances are associated with the particular shape of each groove and

can also be excited by s-polarized incident light [7]- [10], but are independent of the period

of the grating and the incidence angle. Experimental evidence of the SSR excitations was

given by L´opez-Rios et al. [11], for lamellar gratings.

Another kind of resonances that might appear in structures with embedded cavities are the

phase resonances. These resonances have been ﬁrst reported in connection with structures

comprising a ﬁnite number of cavities [12]-[16]. These structures can be regarded as

passive antennas, which exhibit superdirectivity [17] for particular incidence conditions.

When a bunch of cavities is illuminated by a p-polarized plane wave of a certain resonant

wavelength, the far ﬁeld pattern is narrowed while the ﬁeld inside the cavities is enhanced

and the phase diﬀerence between the magnetic ﬁeld at adjacent grooves is 0 or π radians

[16]. This particular phase distribution, which is automatically generated by the resonant

wavelength, produces a superdirective pattern [13, 14, 16].

Phase resonances are not allowed in inﬁnite periodic simple gratings (gratings with a

single groove in the period), since the pseudoperiodicity condition does not permit the

3

ﬁeld inside the cavities to have diﬀerent phases. However, PR in compound gratings under

normal illumination have already been reported [18]. In this case, the specular eﬃciency

is maximized, the interior ﬁeld is intensiﬁed, and the phase distribution of the ﬁeld inside

the grooves takes forms analogous to those of ﬁnite gratings. The dependence of these

resonances on the diﬀerent parameters of the grating was studied in [19]. The existence

of phase resonances in metallic gratings with ohmic losses have also been investigated

recently [20]. Other works on resonant excitations due to dual-period gratings include the

paper by Hibbins et al. [21], where the authors study the excitation of surface plasmons

in metallic structures in the microwave region.

To deal with inﬁnite metallic gratings of particular proﬁles (rectangular, triangular, semi-

circular), several modal approaches have been developed during the last four decades

[7],[9], [22]-[27]. More recently, those modal methods have been generalized to arbitrary

shapes of the corrugations, and numerical tools have been applied to enhance their perfor-

mance [28]-[32]. To solve the diﬀraction problem from a perfectly conducting compound

grating with rectangular grooves we applied the formulation proposed by Andrewartha et.

al for simple gratings [7], and extended it to compound gratings [18]. This method is par-

ticularly suitable for rectangular proﬁles, and enables us to analyze the electromagnetic

response in terms of eigenmodes, which is convenient for studying resonances.

In this paper we investigate the excitation of phase resonances in compound gratings

under oblique illumination. We show that the occurrence of such resonances is intimately

connected with the phase distribution of the magnetic ﬁeld inside the cavities. Particular

attention is paid to the symmetry of the phase conﬁgurations that are automatically

generated by the resonant wavelengths. The diﬀraction problem and the modal method

are brieﬂy described in Sec. 2. Numerical results that evidence the existence of phase

resonances for non-normal incidence are given in Sec. 3, where we show eﬃciency curves

as well as the amplitude and phase of the interior ﬁeld as a function of the wavelength

for a ﬁxed angle of incidence, and for the order -1 and -2 Littrow mounts. The most

signiﬁcant conclusions are summarized in Sec. 4.

II. CONFIGURATION AND METHOD OF RESOLUTION

We consider a p-polarized plane wave of wavelength λ that illuminates a perfectly conduct-

ing compound diﬀraction grating comprising several rectangular grooves in each period,

as shown in Fig. 1. The structure parameters are the period (d), the number of grooves

in each period (N), the width (a) and the depth (h) of each groove, and the distance

between grooves (b). The wave vector ~k of the incident plane wave forms an angle θ0 with

the y-axis.

A comment on the validity of the ideal model of a perfectly conducting structure is

pertinent here. At a ﬁrst sight, one should think that for studying resonances it is basic

to consider a real metallic surface. This is true if we are interested in surface plasmon

excitations, or if we are in the region of the spectrum where these excitations are relevant.

However, the purpose of this paper is to study the excitation of phase resonances, which

are independent from surface plasmon excitations, and arise from a particular distribution

of the ﬁeld inside the cavities. The resonant wavelength is not mainly related with the

refraction index of the metal, but with the particular arrangement of the phase of the

electromagnetic ﬁeld inside the rectangular corrugations. Besides, our study is meant to

deal with large wavelengths (of the order and above the microwave region of the spectrum),

where the conductivity of metals is very high, and they behave as perfect conductors.

The method of resolution is the modal method, which consists in expanding the ﬁelds

inside the grooves in their own eigenfunctions satisfying the boundary conditions at the

lateral walls and at the bottom of each cavity. A complete and detailed description of the

modal method applied to the diﬀraction problem from compound gratings can be found in

Ref. [18]. This method is very suitable for the rectangular proﬁle of the cavities considered

here. In this case, it takes a very simple form and it permits us to study the dependence of

the phase resonances by varying independently the geometrical parameters of the groove.

It has also been shown to be eﬃcient for the calculation of the electromagnetic response

of very deep gratings [33].

For the sake of completeness, we summarize in what follows the modal method applied

5

to the present grating. The essence of the method, is to distribute the space into three

regions: above the structure, inside the grooves, and in the perfect conductor. The

diﬀracted magnetic ﬁeld in the upper region is expressed as Rayleigh expansions, the total

magnetic ﬁeld inside the cavities is expressed by modal expansions, and the ﬁeld inside the

perfect conductor is zero. Then, by enforcing the matching conditions at the horizontal

boundaries between regions, one yields a system of equations for the unknown amplitudes

of the ﬁeld inside and above the grooves, which is solved by a standard numerical technique

for matrix inversion.

III. RESULTS

In this section we show numerical results that account for the existence of phase resonances

in inﬁnite perfectly-conducting compound gratings, when illuminated by an obliquely in-

cident plane wave. Phase resonances under normal illumination have already been inves-

tigated for diﬀerent numbers of grooves in the period [18], and for varying geometrical

parameters of the structure [19]. It was found that this kind of resonances appears for

certain wavelengths that maximize the specularly reﬂected eﬃciency as well as the electro-

magnetic ﬁeld inside the cavities, and, at the same time, generates a particular distribution

of the phase diﬀerence between the magnetic ﬁeld at adjacent grooves, which is of either

π or 0 radians [18].

In what follows we analyze the response of gratings with N = 3 and N = 5 in three

diﬀerent situations: θ0 = 50◦, order -1 Littrow mount, and order -2 Littrow mount. The

existence of phase resonances at oblique illumination is manifested in Fig. 2, where we plot

the specular eﬃciency (2a) and the ﬁeld amplitude (2b) as a function of the wavelength-

to-depth ratio λ/h, for normal incidence and for θ0 = 50◦. The phase diﬀerence between

the fundamental amplitudes of the magnetic ﬁeld at the external grooves for θ0 = 50◦ is

plot in Fig. 2c. This angle was arbitrarily chosen to illustrate the phenomenon at oblique

incidence, since the response of the structure is similar for any θ0 6= 0◦. The parameters

of the grating are N = 3, d/h = 5.5, a/h = 0.3, b/h = 0.1. It can be observed in Fig. 2(a)

6

that for θ0 = 50◦ the specular eﬃciency has two peaks in the range of λ considered, one at

nearly the same wavelength as for normal incidence (λ/h ≈ 4.53), and another one around

λ/h ≈ 5.05. This conﬁrms the existence of phase resonances under oblique illumination.

Moreover, there is a new resonant wavelength that is not present in the normal incidence

case. The amplitude of the fundamental mode of the magnetic ﬁeld inside the diﬀerent

cavities, which in this case is nearly equivalent to the total ﬁeld amplitude in each groove,

is plot in Fig. 2(b). It can be observed that for normal illumination, the ﬁeld is maximized

at the resonant wavelength, as it was already shown in Ref. [18]. On the other hand, for

θ0 = 50◦ the amplitudes of the external grooves are coincident for λ/h = 4.53, and are

very similar in the interval λ/h ∈ [4.6, 5.05] (Fig. 2b, dotted and dashed-dotted curves).

It can be observed in Fig. 2c that the phase diﬀerence between the fundamental mode

amplitudes at the external grooves is zero for λ/h = 4.53 and it is π radians for λ/h = 4.6

and 5.08. The resonance at λ/h = 4.53 can be associated with the π resonance in the

normal incidence case, in which the phase diﬀerence between the external grooves is zero,

and it is π between each one of these grooves and the central one. The second resonance,

however, appears at λ/h = 5.05, which does not correspond to any of the values where

the phase diﬀerence is exactly π. At λ/h = 4.6 the phases of the external cavities are

not symmetric with respect to that of the central one, and since the central amplitude is

comparable to that of the external grooves, it prevents the generation of an eﬀective π

radians diﬀerence necessary to have a phase resonance. On the other hand, for λ/h = 5.08

the phase diﬀerence is exactly π, but although the central groove amplitude is low, for

this wavelength the amplitudes of the external grooves are no longer equal, and then the

symmetry requirement is not fulﬁlled. In summary, the value at which all three conditions

(symmetry in the amplitude distribution, π phase diﬀerence between the external cavities

and low amplitude of the central one) seem to be better achieved is λ/h = 5.05. This

suggests that the generation of phase resonances is connected with the phase diﬀerence

between grooves but also with a certain kind of symmetry in the ﬁeld distribution. It

is important to remark that both requirements are concerned with symmetries that are

7

automatically generated in the structure, even under non-symmetric incidence conditions.

Taking into account that the phase is almost constant within each groove, we can represent

the amplitude and phase of the magnetic ﬁeld at the central position (xj = a/2+j ∗(a+b),

j = 0, ..., N − 1) of the bottom (y = −h) of each groove as a phasor, for the resonant

wavelengths. The phase distribution for the ﬁrst peak in Fig. 2a is nearly the same as

that of the π-mode at normal incidence [16, 18], i.e., the phases of the external grooves

are equal, and diﬀer in ≈ π radians from that of the central groove. On the other hand,

the phase distribution for the second resonance (second peak in Fig. 2a) is diﬀerent: the

phase diﬀerence between the ﬁelds of the external grooves is almost π radians, and the

central groove has an intermediate phase which diﬀers in ≈ π/2 radians from that of the

external grooves. Besides, the central ﬁeld amplitude is negligible. This is a new situation

that was forbidden for normal incidence, and is generated by a resonant wavelength in

oblique incidence.

In Fig. 3 we study the case of the order -1 Littrow mount, and compare the results

obtained for the same grating considered in Figure 2 and for a grating with two grooves

per period (N=2), with the same width a but separated a distance b′/h = (2b+a)/h = 0.5.

The numerical results suggest that the new resonant eﬀect which appears under oblique

incidence is improved in the -1 Littrow case. The specular eﬃciency for N=3 is optimized

for two values of the wavelength (Fig. 3(a)). At these values the ﬁeld inside the external

grooves has nearly the same magnitude (Fig. 3(b)), although this symmetry is not imposed

by the incidence conditions. The phase conﬁgurations for the ﬁrst and the second peak

are very similar to those corresponding to θ0 = 50◦. Notice that even though for the

ﬁrst peak the central groove has the maximum amplitude, for the second peak the ﬁeld

amplitude at the central groove is signiﬁcantly lower than that of the other grooves. This

seems to be a condition necessary to generate this second resonance: there is a phase

diﬀerence of nearly π radians between the fundamental modes of the external grooves

(see Fig. 3c), and the central one does not play any role. Actually, if we compare the

curves for N=2 and N=3 in Figs. 3a and 3b, we observe that the ﬁrst resonance is not

8

present for N=2 but the second is at a close wavelength. This behavior can be explained

as follows. To generate the ﬁrst peak, a phase diﬀerence between the modal amplitudes

at adjacent grooves of π radians is needed. For N=3 the central groove has a signiﬁcant

amplitude and its phase is nearly opposite to the phases of the external grooves, thus

allowing the existence of the resonance. On the other hand, for N=2 the phase diﬀerence

between the grooves is close to zero, what inhibits the generation of the resonance (see

Fig. 3c). For the second peak the situation is diﬀerent, since at this resonant wavelength

the ﬁeld amplitude in the central groove in the N=3 case is too low making this groove

irrelevant for the generation of the resonance, and the π phase diﬀerence needed is found

between the external grooves. Then, replacing the central groove by full metal does not

change signiﬁcantly the ﬁeld distribution and the second resonance is also present in this

case.

The order -2 Littrow mount is analyzed in Figs. 4 and 5. Note that the propagation

direction of the diﬀracted orders is the same here as in normal incidence. Therefore, this

case presents particular interest since, kinematically, it looks equivalent to the normal

incidence situation: the order -1 propagates normally to the structure and the orders 0

and -2 propagate along symmetric directions with respect to the mean normal. In this

case, the ﬁrst resonant peak coincides with that of normal incidence, and the second

maximum is very wide and cannot be regarded as a resonance (see Fig. 4(a)). In fact,

there is no intensiﬁcation of the interior ﬁeld at this wavelength (Fig. 4(b)). In Fig. 5

we show the dependence on the angle of incidence of the specular eﬃciency (Fig. 5(a)),

magnitude (Fig. 5(b)) and phase diﬀerence (Fig. 5(c)) of the magnetic ﬁeld, for the

resonant wavelength corresponding to normal incidence and to order -2 Littrow mount

(λ/h ≈ 4.5302). As expected, the specular eﬃciency has two maxima: one at θ0 = 0◦

and another at θ0 = 55.45◦ which corresponds to -2 Littrow mount, and a minimum at

θ0 = 24.32◦, which corresponds to -1 Littrow mount.

It can be observed in Fig. 5(c)

that the phase diﬀerence between the magnetic ﬁeld at adjacent grooves for θ0 = 55.45◦

and for θ0 = 24.32◦ is equal, although the ﬁeld magnitudes at the external grooves are

9

equal only for -2 Littrow mount (Fig. 5(b)). This result suggests that the -2 Littrow

situation optimizes the resonance, since it automatically generates a highly symmetric

ﬁeld distribution inside the grooves, resembling the high symmetry previously found for

normal incidence.

In Figures 6-7 we investigate a grating with 5 grooves in the period, in the -1 order Littrow

mount. It is important to recall that in the normal incidence case, for an increasing number

of cavities in the period, the number of resonances is also increased [18]. In the case of

oblique incidence, this behavior is also found, as it is shown in Fig. 6 for a grating with

the same parameters as those of the previous ﬁgures, except for N = 5. Comparing the

specular eﬃciency curve with that corresponding to N = 3 (Fig. 3(a)), we notice that

the resonance at λ/h = 4.539 is now split into two peaks at λ/h = 4.475 and λ/h = 4.575

(Fig. 6). The distribution of the amplitude of the magnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of the

grooves for the resonant wavelengths, is illustrated as contour plots in Fig. 7. The black

zones represent the most intense ﬁelds, whereas the white zones represent the weakest

ﬁelds (the perfectly conducting region is light gray). The grey scale was chosen so as to

make it easy to visualize the ﬁeld structure in each case, and therefore it is not maintained

in all three ﬁgures. For instance, the maximum value in Fig. 7(a) is about two times that

of Fig. 7(b), and about ﬁve times that of Fig. 7(c).

For the ﬁrst peak in Fig. 6 (λ/h = 4.475) there is a clear intensiﬁcation of the ﬁeld

inside the grooves, the magnetic ﬁeld being maximum at the central groove. The phase

distribution corresponds to the π-mode [18], i.e., phase diﬀerences of π between adjacent

grooves (Fig. 7(a)). For the second resonance (λ/h = 4.575, Fig. 7(b)), there is also an

enhancement of the ﬁeld within the cavities, even though it is not as strong as for the

ﬁrst peak, and the amplitude at the central groove is very low (≈ 1/25 of the maximum

amplitude inside the cavities). This second resonance is similar to the second peak for

N = 3 (Fig. 3), which was forbidden for normal incidence. The phase of the central

groove forms an angle of ≈ π/2 with the phases of its adjacent grooves, which have

opposite phases; the external grooves have opposite phases too, which are also opposite to

10

their corresponding neighbors. Finally, the intensiﬁcation of the third peak (λ/h = 4.89)

is not as important as in the previous two cases, and the distribution of phases is also

diﬀerent (Fig. 7(c)). This situation seems to be close to the second resonance of normal

incidence (see Fig. 5(b) in Ref. [18]). It is important to remark that for λ diﬀerent from

the resonant values, the interior ﬁeld is signiﬁcantly lower. For an increasing number of

grooves in the period, new splittings of the resonances were found, which give place to

new resonant situations not allowed under normal incidence (not shown).

The results show that phase resonances appear in perfectly conducting compound gratings

not only under normal incidence, which is a highly symmetric situation, but also under

oblique illumination. It is important to remark that even though the generation of phase

resonances is strongly connected with symmetries in the magnetic ﬁeld distribution inside

the cavities (amplitude and phase), these requirements are automatically fulﬁlled for

particular wavelengths, even when the symmetry is not imposed by external conditions.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The existence of phase resonances under oblique illumination has been studied. For this

purpose, we investigated the response of a rectangular perfectly-conducting compound

grating as a function of the wavelength (for a ﬁxed angle of incidence), of the angle of

incidence (for a particular resonant wavelength) and for Littrow mount. New resonant

wavelengths, not allowed for normal incidence, were found. The magnitude and phase

distributions of the magnetic ﬁeld at these wavelengths exhibit a high degree of symmetry.

The magnetic ﬁeld is intensiﬁed inside the grooves, and the specularly reﬂected eﬃciency is

optimized in Littrow mount. The physical mechanism that automatically generates these

particular ﬁeld conﬁgurations is not fully understood yet, but we are working towards

this objective. We are also investigating on the exploitation and optimization of this

phenomenon for its use in optical devices.

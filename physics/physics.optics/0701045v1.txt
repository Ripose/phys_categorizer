Abstract:
Diode lasers enable one to continuously cover the 730 to
1100 nm range as well as the 370 to 550 nm range by frequency doubling,
but a large part of the electro-magnetic spectrum spanning from green to
red remains accessible only through expensive and unpractical optically
pumped dye lasers. Here we devise a method to multiply the frequency
of optical waves by a factor 3/2 with a conversion that is phase-coherent
and highly efﬁcient. Together with harmonic generation, it will enable
one to cover the visible spectrum with semiconductor lasers, opening new
avenues in important ﬁelds such as laser spectroscopy and optical metrology.

Introduction

Nonlinear optics is commonly used to extend the spectrum covered by lasers over unaccessible
regions [1]. For instance, second harmonic generation now is a well established process applied
in frequency conversion, and with continuous wave diode lasers typically it is implemented
inside resonant enhancement optical cavities [2]. Third- and up to ﬁfth-harmonic generation is
now obtained with pulsed lasers easily accessing the UV spectral region with familiar infrared
diode-pumped solid-state lasers. The production of sub-harmonics, on the other hand, has im-
portant applications in metrology and quantum optics. Division in 3:1 ratio is achieved with
active phase stabilization [3] and, more recently, dynamical signatures of self-phase-locking for
the same process were observed [4]. Concerning the 2:1 ratio, both passive and active methods
for the phase stabilization were applied [5, 6, 7]. More generally, frequency downconversion
with OPO’s offers a rather ﬂexible way to access wide regions of the infrared and near-infrared
spectrum, but to generate continuous-wave and single-frequency radiation one employs single
resonant OPO’s, which require multi Watts pump lasers [8], or double resonant OPO’s which,
with a modest electronic stabilization of the composing elements, show a considerably reduced
threshold [5, 9].

We report on the ﬁrst demonstration of optical frequency multiplication by a factor 3/2.
We show that our frequency multiplier, based on a multi-resonant OPO, is inherently phase
coherent, preserving the single longitudinal character of the incident ﬁeld without active phase
stabilization, efﬁcient, with a 30 % slope efﬁciency and few tens of milliWatts threshold, and
stable on time scales of the order of several minutes.

2. The 3/2 frequency multiplier

The converter is based on an OPO where the pump, the signal, and the idler ﬁelds are all
resonant in the cavity and which is operated at frequency degeneracy making the signal and
idler frequencies to coincide. The OPO generated ﬁeld has then half the frequency of the pump,
and by inserting in the cavity a nonlinear crystal for summing the pump and the OPO ﬁelds,
we are able to generate radiation at 3/2 the pump frequency. Exact degeneracy operation is

Fig. 1. 3/2 frequency multiplier experimental setup. A continuous wave and single fre-
quency pump laser delivering 400 mW of 1006.5 nm is converted into 40 mW radiation at
671 nm. The pump laser is resonantly coupled into a cavity where 20 mm long periodically
poled KTP [17] nonlinear crystals are set so to satisfy quasi phase-matching for degenerate
frequency down-conversion (OPO), and sum frequency generation between the pump and
down-converted light at 2013 nm (SFG). The wedged surfaces of the crystals are cut at
an angle of 100 mrad with respect to the crystal axis. The input (output) facet of the OPO
(SFG) crystal is at normal incidence. The two inclined surfaces facing each other are paral-
lel. The transverse displacement of the nonlinear crystals provides an independent control
over the cavity dispersion, insuring simultaneous resonance of the two infrared ﬁelds.

obtained owing to the double gain of the indistinguishable splitting process with respect to all
the other processes originating signal and idler photons [5].

The triple resonance condition has the advantage of reducing the threshold of oscillation on
the pump intensity down to the milliWatts level [10] and allows active stabilization of the cavity
length with respect to the pump frequency. On the other hand, the dispersive behavior of the
optical elements of the cavity, i.e. mirrors and nonlinear crystals, prevents one from controlling
the frequencies of the OPO generated ﬁelds independently, which has so far made single mode
operation in triply resonant OPO’s hard to achieve. In our system the triply resonant condition
allows to actively stabilize the cavity length against the pumping laser, strongly relaxing the
requirements on the passive stabilization. We observed an oscillation threshold as low as 40
mW. By introducing an independent control on the OPO frequency modes via a ﬁne tuning of
the relative phase accumulated between the pump and OPO-generated ﬁelds over one cavity
roundtrip we achieve the simultaneous resonance of the pump and OPO ﬁelds at frequency
degeneracy.

We demonstrate the 3/2 frequency multiplier producing radiation at 671 nm starting from a
laser source at 1006.5 nm, as schematically reported in Fig. 1. The pump laser is composed by a
semiconductor Master-Oscillator Power-Ampliﬁer system. The master laser is an antireﬂection
coated diode laser stabilized on an extended cavity in the Littrow conﬁguration [11, 12] deliver-
ing 30 mW at 1006.5 nm on a single longitudinal mode with less than 500 kHz linewidth. This
laser is then ampliﬁed to 400 mW preserving its spectral properties through a semiconductor
tapered ampliﬁer [13]. The pump radiation is coupled into an optical cavity composed by highly
reﬂective mirrors at 1006.5 nm and 2013 nm, and highly transmitting at 671 nm [14]. The input
mirror has a 10 % transmission at 1006.5 nm in order to maximize the coupling of the pump
ﬁeld into the cavity under resonance. One of the folding mirrors is mounted on a piezoelectric
transducer (PZT) to actively stabilize the cavity length to the pump ﬁeld resonance. To this
purpose the error signal is provided by the polarization analysis of the reﬂected pump [15], and
by inserting into the cavity a vertical polarizer.

Fig. 2. Transmission spectra of the frequency multiplied light through a confocal Fabry-
Perot (FP) spectrum analyzer. Displacing the nonlinear crystals transversally we tune the
cavity dispersion in order to impose single frequency emission (b), or multi mode emission
(a). c) The Gaussian beam proﬁle of the 3/2 frequency multiplied output is veriﬁed by
coupling the single frequency radiation mainly into the fundamental transverse mode of
the FP cavity, which results in doubling the spacing among the resonance peaks [20].

The independent control on the OPO cavity frequency modes under pump resonance condi-
tions is obtained by cutting the crystals with a wedged shape [16] (see Fig. 1). Displacing the
crystals along the direction of the wedge enables one to change the optical path in the crystal
and, due to the dispersion, it allows a ﬁne tuning of the OPO resonance modes while keeping
the cavity resonant with the pump ﬁeld. The two nonlinear crystals are 20 mm long, 2×1 mm2
cross section, periodically poled KTP [17] that insure quasi-phase-matching for linearly and
identically polarized ﬁelds. The OPO and SFG crystals have a poling period of L OPO = 38 and
L SFG = 19.5 m m respectively, and they are identically cut in an asymmetric way such that one
surface is at normal incidence, while the other has an angle f of 100 mrad with respect to the
crystal axis. In the resonator the crystals have the wedged side facing and parallel such that the
optical axis coincide. This conﬁguration, while it allows to control the relative phase between
the pump and OPO ﬁelds, it insures a negligible deviation of the beam propagation at differ-
ent wavelengths, and hence simultaneous resonance of the pump and degenerate OPO ﬁelds.
To reach the double resonance and frequency degenerate condition, we observe a 400 m m pe-
riodicity on the crystal transverse position. This is consistent with the calculated periodicity
L OPO/f = 380 m m. The crystal surfaces are all anti-reﬂection coated such that the reﬂectivity
per surface is 0.1% at 1006.5 nm and 2013 nm, and 0.3% at 671 nm.

3. Spectral properties and conversion efﬁciency

The spectral properties of the generated red light are analyzed both with a lambda-meter for the
rough wavelength determination, and a confocal Fabry-Perot spectrometer (FP) to check the

(cid:13)
(cid:13)
single longitudinal mode operation [18]. As expected, the spectrum of the generated red light
depends on cavity dispersion. When we change the transverse position of the crystal by tens
of microns we are able to switch between single frequency emission at the expected value and
multi frequency emission with central wavelength displaced as much as 0.08 nm from 671 nm,
with a simultaneous reduction in the output power. Figure 2 reports the typical spectra from the
Fabry-Perot analyzer when the OPO operates close to the degenerate point. Depending on the
transverse position of the crystals, the system emits single (spectrum 2b) or multi (2a) longi-
tudinal mode radiation with a stability of the order of minutes. In the multi-longitudinal mode
operation, energy conservation results in the symmetric positioning of the frequency compo-
nents with respect to the degenerate mode [19]. The spatial mode of the red light has a nearly
Gaussian proﬁle. As a check we carefully aligned the FP analyzer in order to discern the even
and odds transverse modes of the cavity [20]. As reported in Fig. 2c, we can couple 97 % of
the power into the even transverse modes, indicating that at least 94 % of the generated power
is in the fundamental transverse mode. While multi-longitudinal mode operation is stable on
hours, when the converter emits single frequency radiation it proves to be stable on timescale
of order of several minutes. Such a stability requires no active stabilization of the crystals po-
sition. Figure 3 depicts the amplitude of the generated red light when the frequency multiplier
works in single longitudinal mode. The measured amplitude noise is 1.4 % RMS on a 50 kHz
bandwidth.
The single longitudinal mode emission proves that the OPO works at frequency degeneracy,
and it is known that for type-I phase matching (as provided by the periodically poled crystals)
in frequency degenerate OPO’s the pump and downconverted ﬁelds are phase locked and that
they may exhibit p phase jumps [5]. On the other hand the phase of the fundamental ﬁeld in the
cavity is locked to that of the incident beam because of the pump-cavity resonance condition.
Since the frequency sum process should not add any relevant phase noise, we have an evidence
that the 3/2 multiplication process is phase coherent. A comparison with independently gener-
ated phase coherent ﬁelds will allow a thorough characterization of the stability of the phase
transfer [21].

We determine the conversion efﬁciency by varying the pump power and measuring the gen-
erated power in the red as a function of the IR power coupled into the cavity [22]. We observe
a threshold for OPO oscillation smaller than 50 mW and obtain a 30 % incremental efﬁciency
above 150 mW pump power coupled into the cavity (see Fig. 4). Reducing the intensity of the
pump below 2/3 of the full power raises the amplitude noise in the output, and makes the sys-
tem more critical to operate on a single longitudinal mode. Such a degrading can be overcome
by using a different geometry optimized for lower pump levels, with better focussing of the
cavity mode on the nonlinear crystals, and choosing different crystals with higher nonlinear
polarizability [10].

The wavelength tunability of the source can be limited either by the tunability of the funda-
mental laser, or by that of the 3/2 frequency multiplier. Typically anti-reﬂection coated infrared
semiconductor lasers have a tunability of few percent in wavelength, and in our case the laser
can emit from 990 nm to 1040 nm. Concerning the multiplier, the nonlinear crystals can be tem-
perature tuned to satisfy quasi-phase-matching at different wavelengths. With our crystals, to
generate radiation at 670 nm, one nm shorter wavelength, we have to tune master laser to 1005
nm, cool the OPO crystal by 5 Celsius, and cool the SFG crystal by 20. With a given choice of
grating periods, a reasonable temperature tunability of the multiplier is 0.5 % in wavelength.
This can be extended, without loss of efﬁciency, to the full 5 % tunability of the pump by using
multichannel periodically poled crystals [23], which include the 10 grating periods necessary to
access the relevant wavelength intervals. The mirrors of the cavity have a ﬂat response beyond
the window accessible through the master laser.

width.

4. Conclusion

To summarize, we demonstrated for the ﬁrst time a scheme to multiply the frequency of con-
tinuous wave optical radiation by a factor 3/2 and preserving its single frequency character.
The frequency multiplier is phase coherent, has a high conversion efﬁciency, is very stable, and
its stability on hours timescale could easily be achieved by optimizing the design of the opto-
mechanical apparatus. Employing existing technology, the scheme will easily ﬁnd applications
in many disciplines requiring laser in the green to red spectral interval, such a spectroscopy.
Together with integer harmonic generation, 3/2 frequency multiplication will allow to access
the complete visible spectrum via harmonic generation of semiconductor lasers. It makes pos-
sible to establish phase coherent links among spectral regions distant 2/3 of an octave [24], and
it may considerably simplify the realization of RGB laser systems.
It is worth noting that the frequency multiplier also acts as a parity discriminator on the pump
resonant mode. In fact, neglecting cavity dispersion, the frequency degenerate and resonant
down conversion can take place only when the pump is resonant in the cavity with an even
number of modes. This is conﬁrmed by the single frequency emission of the converter with a
twofold periodicity when stepping the cavity length between adjacent pump resonances.

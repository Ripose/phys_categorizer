We have developed a scattering-matrix approach for numerical calculation of resonant states
and Q-values of a nonideal optical disk cavity of an arbitrary shape and of an arbitrary varying
refraction index. The developed method has been applied to study the eﬀect of surface roughness
and inhomogeneity of the refraction index on Q-values of microdisk cavities for lasing applications.
We demonstrate that even small surface roughness (∆r . λ/50) can lead to a drastic degradation
of high-Q cavity modes by many orders of magnitude. The results of numerical simulation are
analyzed and explained in terms of wave reﬂection at a curved dielectric interface combined with
the examination of Poincar´e surfaces of section and Husimi distributions.

INTRODUCTION

Dielectric and polymeric microcavities represent a great potential for possible applications in lasing optoelecronic
devices1,2. In conventional lasers, a signiﬁcant fraction of optical pump power is lost and a rather high threshold
power is needed to initiate the lasing eﬀect. In contrast, spherical and disk cavities can be used to support highly
eﬃcient low-threshold lasing operation. The high eﬃciency of such devices is related to the existence the natural
cavity resonances. These resonances are known as morphology-dependent resonances or whispering gallery modes3.
The nature of these resonances can be envisioned in a ray optic picture, when light is trapped inside the cavity through
the total internal reﬂection on the cavity-air boundary.

In dielectric cavities optically pumped quantum wells, wires or dots provide an active medium sustaining the
lasing operation4,5,6,7,8. Polymeric microcavity lasers are made with an active medium including host and guest
molecules9,10,11. The absorbed light is transferred from the photoexcited host molecules in the non-radiative way by
means of resonant energy transfer to the guest molecules. A stimulated emission from the active medium of dielectric
and polymeric cavities is trapped in high-Q modes for a very long time. This leads to a signiﬁcant increase of intensity
of radiation inside the cavity and hence to low-threshold laser operation.

lower4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. A reduction of a Q-factor may be attributed to a variety of reasons including side wall geometrical
imperfections, inhomogeneity of the diﬀraction index of the disk, eﬀects of coupling to the substrate or pedestal and
others. A detailed study of the eﬀects of the above factors on the characteristics and performance of the microcavity
lasers appears to be of crucial importance for the design, tailoring and optimization of Q-values of lasing microdisk
cavities. Such the studies would require an eﬀective computational method that can deal with both complex geometry
and variable refraction index in the cavity.

One of the most powerful and versatile numerical techniques often used in photonic simulation is the ﬁnite diﬀerence
time domain method (FDTD)12,13,14. A severe disadvantage of this technique in application to the cavities with small
surface imperfections is that the smooth geometry of the cavity has to be mapped into a discrete grid with very small
lattice constant. This makes the application of this method to the problem at hand rather impractical in terms of
both computational power and memory.

Another class of computational methods reduces the Helmholtz equation in the inﬁnite two-dimensional space into
contour integral equations deﬁned at the cavity boundaries. These methods include the T -matrix technique15,16, the
boundary integral methods17,18, and others19. These methods are computationally eﬀective and capable to deal with
the cavities of arbitrary geometry. However, the above methods require the refraction index be constant inside the
cavity boundary.

In the present paper we develop a new, computationally eﬀective, and numerically stable approach based on the
scattering matrix technique that is capable to deal with both arbitrary complex geometry and inhomogeneous refraction
index inside the cavity. Note that the scattering matrix technique is widely used in analysis of waveguides20 as well as
in quantum mechanical simulations21. This technique was also used for the analysis of resonant cavities for geometries
when the analytical solution was available22.

The main idea of the method consists of dividing the cavity region into N narrow concentric rings. At each i-th

2

boundary between the neighboring rings we calculate the scattering matrix Si that relates the states propagating (or
decaying) towards the boundary, with those propagating (or decaying) away of the boundary. Successively combining
SN, we eventually relate the combined matrix to the

. . .
total scattering matrix of the cavity S. In order to calculate the lifetime of the cavity modes (and, therefore their
Q-factor) we compute the Wigner-Smith lifetime matrix23 which, in turn, is expressed in terms of the total scattering
matrix S2,23,24.

Because at each step we combine only two scattering matrixes, it is not required to keep track of the solution in the
whole space. This obviously eliminates the need for storing large matrices and facilitates the computational speed. It
is also well known that the scattering matrix technique (in contrast, for example, to the transfer matrix technique)
is not plagued by numerical instability, because exponentially growing and decaying evanescent waves are separated
in course of the computation. Note that the present technique of combining S-matrixes is conceptually similar to the
recurrence algorithm for calculating electromagnetic scattering from a multilayered sphere25,26. However, in contrast
to these works, the scattering matrix technique presented here can be applied to the systems where the refraction
index varies as a function of both radial and angular coordinates.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section II A we develop the scattering matrix technique for disk-shaped
cavities. The results of numerical calculations of resonant states and Q-values of nonideal cavities on the basis of the
developed technique are presented in Section III. We consider and compare two cases, a disk cavity of a constant
refraction index n with side wall imperfection (surface roughness), and, a disk cavity of an ideal circular shape but
with inhomogeneous refraction index n = n(r, ϕ). The results of numerical simulation are analyzed and explained in
terms of wave reﬂection at a curved dielectric interface combined with the examination of Poincar´e surfaces of section
and Husimi function. Finally, we present our conclusion in Section IV.

II. THE SCATTERING MATRIX APPROACH

A. Formalism

We consider a two-dimensional cavity with the refraction index n surrounded by air. Because the majority of
experiments are performed only with the lowest transverse mode occupied, we neglect the transverse (z-) dependence
of the ﬁeld and thus limit ourself to the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation. The two-dimensional Helmholtz equation
for z-components of electromagnetic ﬁeld is given by

where Ψ = Ez (Hz) for TM (TE)-modes, and k is the wave vector in vacuum. Remaining components of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld can be derived from Ez (Hz) in a standard way.

FIG. 1: Schematic geometry of a cavity with the refraction index n surrounded by air. The space is divided in three regions.
In the inner (r < d) and in the outer regions (r > R) the refraction indexes are constant. In the intermediate region d < r < R
the refraction index n is a function of both r and ϕ. The intermediate region is divided by N narrow concentric rings. In each
ring the refraction coeﬃcient is regarded as a function of the angle only, ni = ni(ϕ).

We divide our system in three region, the outer region, r > R, the inner region, r < d, and the intermediate region,
d < r < R, see Fig. 1. We choose R and d in such a way that in the outer and the inner region the refraction indexes
are independent of the coordinate, whereas in the intermediate region n is a function of both r and ϕ. In the outer
region the solution to the Helmholtz equation can be written in the form

These two conditions can be used to control numerical results for the scattering matrix.

In order to apply the scattering matrix technique we divide the intermediate region into N narrow concentric rings,
see Figs. 1, 2. Within each i-th ring we write down the solution to the Helmholtz equation as a linear superposition of
the states propagating (or decaying) out of the disk center and the states propagating (or decaying) towards the disk
center (the detailed form of these states will be given in Section II B, see Eq. (20)). At each i-th boundary (deﬁned
as a boundary between the i-th and i + 1-th rings) we can introduce the scattering matrix Si that relates the states

B. Calculation of the wave functions in the intermediate region d < r < R

In the intermediate region the refraction index n depends on both r and ϕ. Therefore, in contrast to the inner and
outer regions, in the intermediate region we can not separate variables and ﬁnd an exact analytical solution to the
Helmholtz equation. We can however write down an approximate solution to the Helmholtz equation in each ring.
For this purpose let us look for the solution in the form Ψ(r, ϕ) = R(r)Φ(ϕ). Substituting this solution into Eq. (1)
we obtain

regard r as a constant within each i-th ring, r
n(r, ϕ) = ni(ϕ). In this approximation the variables in Eq. (17) separate such that for i-th ring we can write

III. NONIDEAL MICRODISK CAVITIES

In this Section we apply the scattering matrix method to the calculation of resonant states and Q-values of nonideal
microdisk cavities with (a) side wall imperfections and (b) circular cavities with inhomogeneous refraction index
n = n(r, ϕ). In order to validate present method, we have also performed numerical calculations for structures where
the analytical solution was available. This includes, for example, an annular billiard consisting of a dielectric disk
placed inside a larger disk with some displacement of the disk center22, as well as an ideal circular disk displaced from
the origin of coordinate system. In the latter case, the positions of the resonant states and Q-values are obviously
independent of the choice of the coordinate system. However, from computational point of view this case is not simpler
than that of a cavity of an arbitrary shape, because the displacement from the origin lifts the radial symmetry and
makes the separation of variables impossible. As an additional tool to validate the numerical solution we use Eqs.
(4),(5) to control the unitarity and symmetry of the scattering matrix.

A.

Ideal circular cavity

Let us ﬁrst brieﬂy analyze the resonant states and Q-values of an ideal circular cavity with the radius R and the
refraction index n. In this case the scattering matrix can be easily written in analytical form. Employing the matching
conditions Eq. (22) between the wave function in the outer region r > R, Eq. (2), and the wave function inside the
disk given by the Bessel functions Jq(nkr) for r < R, Eq. (8), we arrive to the expression for the scattering matrix in
the form22

with ξ = n (1/n) for TM (TE) modes. Derivatives are taken over the full arguments in the brackets. Resonant states
of an ideal cavity can be inferred from the scattering matrix Eq. (24) using Eq. (15).

Each resonant states of an open disk is characterized by two wave numbers, q and m. These two numbers are directly
related to the corresponding numbers of the closed resonator of the same radius R. The index m is a radial wave number
and it is related to the number of nodes of the ﬁeld components in the radial direction inside the disk. The index
q is called an angular (or azimuthal) wave number because of the analogy to quantum mechanics where the angular
momentum is given by LQM = ~q. Equating the quantum and classical angular momenta (LClas = pR sin χ, p = ~nk)
we ﬁnd the relation between the angular wave number and the angle of incidence χ in a classical ray picture22

q = nkR sin χ.

(25)

Here we are mostly interested in the whispering gallery modes with high Q-values for which the angle of incidence is
larger than the angle of total internal reﬂection, χ > χc (sin χc = 1/n). For such angles of incidence, the transmission

probability T of an electromagnetic wave incident on a curved interface of radius ρ is small, T

B. Nonideal cavities with (a) surface roughness and (b) inhomogeneous refraction index

In this Section we present the results of numerical calculations of resonant states and Q-values of nonideal cavities.
We consider separately two cases, (a), a disk cavity of a constant refraction index n but with side wall imperfection
(surface roughness), and, (b), a disk cavity of an ideal circular shape but with inhomogeneous refraction index
n = n(r, ϕ).

∼

Various studies indicate that a typical size of the side-wall imperfections can vary in the range of 5-300 nm (repre-
0.05-1% of the cavity radius).6,7,8,11. An exact experimental shape of the cavity-air
senting a variation of the order of
interface is however not available. We thus model the interface shape as a superposition of random Gaussian deviations
from an ideal circle of radius R with a maximal amplitude ∆r/2 and a characteristic distance between the deviation
maxima ∆l
2πR/50. In a similar fashion we model the inhomogeneity of the diﬀraction index in the cavity, where a
= 1.8. The variation
parameter ∆n characterizes a mean deviation of the refraction index n from its average value
of the refraction index n can be caused by diﬀerent factors including the presence of quantum well/wires/dots forming
an active medium of the cavity, the local ﬁeld intensity dependence n = n(I), and other factors. Examples of typical
structures under investigation are shown in Fig. 4.

R = 5µm, n = 1.8 (a), hni = 1.8 (b). Note that in the case (b) the resonances shift when ∆n varies. For the sake of clearness
we plot all the resonances centered around their maxima of the corresponding ideal disk (i. e. ∆n = 0). The broadening of the
high-Q resonance TM55,7 is not discernible on the scale of the ﬁgure for all the values of ∆n. Insets in Figs. (a) and (b) show
the dependencies Q = Q(∆r) and Q = Q(∆n) respectively.

Let us ﬁrst concentrate on the low-Q state TM55,7 (q = 55, m = 7). A decrease of the both surface roughness ∆r and
the refractive index inhomogeneity ∆n causes graduate and rather slow decrease of the Q-value of this state as shown
in the insets to Fig. 5. This behavior is typical for all other low-Q states. In contrast, the high-Q resonances exhibit
very diﬀerent and rather striking behavior. Namely, these resonances show a dramatic decrease of their Q-values even
for very small values of the surface roughness ∆r . λ/50. At the same time, the Q-values of the cavity decrease
much more slowly when the refractive index inhomogeneity ∆n increases. For example, let us choose ∆r = 20nm and
∆n = 5%. For these values of ∆r and ∆n the Q-value of the low-Q state TM55,7 drops by the same factor of
1.3,

the same time, for the above value of ∆n = 5%, the Q-value of this resonance decreases to the value of Q
104. (Note that for the case of an ideal cavity the high-Q resonances
which corresponds to the drop by the factor
are so narrow that the numerical resolution does not allow a reliable estimation of their exact values. In this case we
therefore use Eq. (3) to estimate their Q-values.)

In the previous Section we found that the surface roughness ∆r and refraction index inhomogeneity ∆n that produce
similar degradation of low-Q states, cause strikingly diﬀerent eﬀect on high-Q resonances. In order to understand these
features, we shall combine Poincar´e surface of section and Husimi function methods with an analysis of ray reﬂection
at a curved dielectric interface. The Poincar´e surface of section (SoS) is a powerful tool visualizing the phase space
for a classical ray dynamics in cavities2,29. We concentrate on the surface section of the phase space along the cavity
boundary, r
surf. For a given resonant state with an angular number q, the corresponding ray is launched with the
angle χ0 = arcsin (q/nkR) according to Eq. (25). Each reﬂection at the boundary (characterizing by the polar angle
ϕ, and the angle of incidence χ), corresponds to a single point in the plot. The number of bounces for a given angle
of incidence χ0 is chosen in such a way that the total path of the ray does not exceed the one extracted from the
numerically calculated Q-value for the corresponding resonance, L = cτD = Q/(kn). Figures 6 (a)-(c), (g)-(i) show
a Poincar´e surfaces of section (SoS) for the geometrical rays corresponding to the states TM55,7, TM82,1 for diﬀerent
values of the surface roughness ∆r. For an ideal circular disk (∆r = 0) the Poincar´e SoS are obviously straight lines
corresponding to a constant angle of incidence χ = χ0. Figures 6 (b)-(c), (h)-(i) demonstrate that initially regular
dynamics of an ideal cavity transforms into a chaotic one even for a cavity with maximum roughness ∆r . 20nm.
In Figs. 6 (b)-(c), (h)-(i) ∆χch approximately indicates the broadening of the phase space due to transition to the
chaotic dynamics. An important observation is that for a given surface roughness ∆r the broadening of the phase
space is independent of angular mode q, i.e. it is the same for low- and high-Q states.

We complement classical Poincar´e SoS by the Husimi function analysis2,29,30. The Husimi function (often called
also Husimi distributions) H(ϕ, χ) represents a quantum (wave) analog to a classical Poincar´e SoS. It is deﬁned as a

Husimi functions is the same as the corresponding broadening ∆χch in the Poincar´e SoS. (Illustrative examples of the
wave functions in cavities for diﬀerent surface roughness ∆n are shown in Fig. 7).

∆n = 5%.

Figure 8 shows the Husimi distributions for a circular cavity with an inhomogeneous refraction index. The variation
of the refraction index ∆n = 5% is chosen in such a way that the degradation of the Q-value for the low-Q resonance
TM55,7 is the same as the one for the case of surface roughness ∆r = 20nm shown in Fig. 6. As expected, the
broadening of the Husimi distribution due to increase of ∆n is of the same order as for the corresponding values ∆r
(compare Figs. 6 and 8).

According to Eq (3), one can expect an increase of the transmission coeﬃcient (and therefore decrease of the Q-value
of the cavity) due to the broadening of the phase space ∆χch, because the incidence angle χ eﬀectively moves closer
to the angle of the total internal reﬂection χc. ∆Tch in Fig. 3 indicates the estimated increase of the transmission
coeﬃcient due to the broadening of the phase space, ∆χch, as extracted from the Poincar´e SoS for the ∆r = 20nm
and ∆n = 5%. For the low-Q resonance TM55,7 this corresponds to the decrease of the Q-value by the factor of
∆Qch ∼
104 (see
Fig. 3), which is consistent with the calculated decrease of this resonance for the case of the inhomogeneous refraction
index only. (Note that because of a rather approximate deﬁnition of ∆χch we can give only very rough estimation

For the case of high-Q resonance TM82.1 the estimated decrease of the Q-factor is ∆Qch ∼

1.5, which is consistent with the calculated decrease of the low-Q resonances.

of the factor ∆Tch.) On the contrary, for the case of high-Q resonances in the presence of surface imperfections, this
estimated value of ∆Qch is in many orders of magnitude smaller that the actual calculated decrease of the Q-factor
(given by factor of

1011, see Fig. 5).

To explain the rapid degradation of high-Q resonances, we concentrate on another aspect of the wave dynamics.
Namely, the imperfections at the surface boundary eﬀectively introduce a local radius of a surface curvature ρ that
is distinct from the disk radius R (see illustration in Fig. 4). One may thus expect that with the presence of the
local surface curvature, the total transmission coeﬃcient will be determined by the averaged value of ρ rather than
by the disk radius R. The dependence of ρ on surface roughness ∆r for the present model of surface imperfections
is shown in the inset to Fig. 3. Figure 3 demonstrates that the reduction of the local radius of curvature from 5µm
108. This estimate,
(ideal disk) to 1.7µm (∆r = 20nm) causes an increase of the transmission coeﬃcient by ∆Tcur ≈
combined with the estimate based on the change of ∆Tch is fully consistent with the actual computed decrease of the
Q-factor shown in Fig. 5. We thus conclude that the main mechanism responsible for the rapid degradation of high-Q
resonances in non-ideal cavities is the enhanced radiative decay through the curved surface because the eﬀective local
radius (given by the surface roughness) is smaller that the disk radius R.

In contrast, the degradation of low-Q resonances (as well as high-Q resonances in the case of inhomogeneous
refraction index only), is mostly related to the broadening of the phase space caused by the transition to the chaotic
dynamics. It should be noted however that both factors (broadening of the phase space and the enhancement of the
transmission due to decrease of the eﬀective radius of curvature) may play a comparable role in degradation of the
low-Q whispering-gallery resonances in the presence of surface roughness.

It is interesting to note that an analogues degradation of high-Q modes was recently found in hexagonal-shaped
microcavities, where the modes were strongly inﬂuenced by roundings of the corners even when the characteristic length
scale (the local radius of curvature) was one order of magnitude smaller than the wavelength31. It is worth mentioning
that one often assumes that long-lived high-Q resonances in idealized cavities (e.g. in ideal disks, hexagons, etc.) are
not important for potential application in optical communication or laser devices18,22 because of their extremely
narrow width. Our simulations demonstrate that it is not the case, because in real structures the Q-values of these
resonances becomes comparable to those of intermediate-Q resonances already for small or moderate surface roughness
of ∆r

50 nm.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In the present paper we develop a new, computationally eﬀective, and numerically stable approach based on the
scattering matrix (S-matrix) technique that is capable to deal with both arbitrary complex geometry and inhomo-
geneous refraction index inside the two-dimensional cavity. The derivation is based on the separation of the cavity
region into N narrow concentric rings and calculation of the S-matrix at every boundary between the rings. The total
S-matrix is obtained in a recursive way by successive combination of the scattering matrixes for all the boundaries.
In order to calculate the lifetime of the cavity modes (and, therefore their Q-factors) we compute the Wigner-Smith
time delay-matrix which, in turn, is expressed in terms of the total scattering matrix.

We apply the developed algorithm to the calculation of resonant states and Q-values of nonideal microdisk cavities
with (a) side wall imperfections and (b) circular cavities with inhomogeneous refraction index n = n(r, ϕ). We ﬁnd
that the surface roughness ∆r and refraction index inhomogeneity ∆n that produce similar degradation of low-Q
states, cause strikingly diﬀerent eﬀect on high-Q resonances. In particularly, in the case of inhomogeneous refraction
index the increase of ∆n causes rather graduate decrease of the Q-value of high-Q resonances. In contrast, in the
presence of surface roughness even small imperfections (∆r . λ/50) can lead to a drastic degradation of high-Q cavity
modes by many orders of magnitude.

In order to understand these features, we combine Poincar´e surface of section and Husimi function methods with an
analysis of ray reﬂection at a curved dielectric interface. We argue that the main mechanism responsible for the rapid
degradation of high-Q resonances in non-ideal cavities with the surface roughness is the enhanced radiative decay
through the curved surface because the eﬀective local radius (given by the surface roughness) is smaller that the disk
radius R. In contrast, the degradation of low-Q resonances (as well as high-Q resonances in the case of inhomogeneous
refraction index only), is mostly related to the broadening of the phase space caused by the transition to the chaotic
dynamics.

Abstract: Based on a recent formulation of the V –parameter of a
photonic crystal ﬁber we provide numerically based empirical expres-
sions for this quantity only dependent on the two structural parameters
— the air hole diameter and the hole-to-hole center spacing. Based on
the unique relation between the V –parameter and the equivalent mode
ﬁeld radius we identify how the parameter space for these ﬁbers is re-
stricted in order for the ﬁbers to remain single mode while still having
a guided mode conﬁned to the core region.

1 Introduction

Theoretical descriptions of photonic crystal ﬁbers (PCFs) have traditionally been re-
stricted to numerical evaluation of Maxwell’s equations. In the most general case, a
plane wave expansion method with periodic boundary conditions is employed [1] while
other methods, such as the multipole method [2], take advantage of the localized nature
of the guided modes and to some extend the circular shape of the air-holes. The reason
for the application of these methods is the relatively complex dielectric cross section of
a PCF for which rotational symmetry is absent.

The aim of this work is to provide a set of numerically based empirical expressions
describing the basic properties such as cutoﬀ and mode-ﬁeld radius of a PCF based on
the fundamental geometrical parameters only.

2 Fiber geometry and numerical method

We consider the ﬁber structure ﬁrst studied by Knight et al. [3] and restrict our study
to ﬁbers that consist of pure silica with a refractive index of 1.444. The air holes of
diameter d are arranged on a triangular grid with a pitch, Λ. In the center an air hole
is omitted creating a central high index defect serving as the ﬁber core. A schematic
drawing of such a structure is shown in the inset of the right panel in Fig. 1.

Depending on the dimensions, the structure comprises both single- and multi-mode
ﬁbers with large mode area as well as nonlinear ﬁbers. The results presented here cover
relative air hole sizes, d/Λ, from 0.2 to 0.9 and normalized wavelengths, λ/Λ, from
around 0.05 to 2. The modeling is based on the plane-wave expansion method with
periodic boundary conditions [1]. For the calculations of guided modes presented the
size of the super cell was 8 × 8 resolved by 256 × 256 plane waves while for calculations
on the cladding structure only, the super cell was reduced to a simple cell resolved by
32 × 32 planes waves.

3 The V –parameter and the relative mode-ﬁeld radius

When attempting to establish a simple formalism for the PCF it is natural to strive for a
result similar to the V –parameter known from standard ﬁbers [4, 5]. However, a simple
translation is not straight forward since no wavelength-independent core- or cladding

for a PCF given by [6]

VPCF = 2π

Although this expression has the same overall mathematical form as known from stan-
dard ﬁbers, the unique nature of the PCF is taken into account. In Eq. (1), nFM(λ) is
the wavelength dependent eﬀective index of the fundamental mode (FM) and nFSM(λ)
is the corresponding eﬀective index of the ﬁrst cladding mode in the inﬁnite periodic
cladding structure often denoted the fundamental space ﬁlling mode (FSM). For a more
detailed discussion of this expression and its relation to previous work we refer to Ref. [6]
and references therein. We have recently argued that the higher-order mode cut-oﬀ can
be associated with a value of VPCF = π [6] and showed that this criterion is indeed iden-
tical to the single-mode boundary calculated from the multipole method [7]. Recently
the cut oﬀ results have also been conﬁrmed experimentally [8]. Further supporting the
deﬁnition of VPCF is the recent observation [9] that the relative equivalent mode ﬁeld
radius of the fundamental mode, wPCF/Λ as function of VPCF fold over a single curve
independent of d/Λ. The mode ﬁeld radius wPCF is deﬁned as Aeﬀ = πw2
PCF and cor-
responds to the 1/e2 width of a Gaussian intensity distribution with the same eﬀective
area, Aeﬀ , as the fundamental mode itself [9].

In the left panel of Fig. 1, calculated curves of VPCF as function of Λ/λ are shown
for d/Λ ranging from 0.20 to 0.70 in steps of 0.05. In general, all curves are seen to
approach constant levels dependent on d/Λ. The horizontal dashed line indicates the
single-mode boundary VPCF = π. In the right panel, wPCF/Λ is plotted as function of
VPCF for each of the 9 curves in the left panel and as seen all curves fold over a single
curve. An empirical expression for wPCF/Λ can be found in Ref. [9]. The mode is seen
to expand rapidly for small values of VPCF and the mode-ﬁeld radius saturates toward
a constant value when VPCF becomes large. In fact, it turns out that wPCF/Λ ≃ 1.00
for VPCF = 1 and wPCF/Λ ≃ 0.62 for VPCF = π. In the left panel of Fig. 2, curves
corresponding to constant values of VPCF are shown in a λ/Λ versus d/Λ plot. In the
right panel, curves of constant wPCF/Λ is shown, also in a λ/Λ versus d/Λ plot. Since
there is a unique relation between wPCF/Λ and VPCF [9] the curves naturally have the
same shape.

When designing a PCF any combination of d and Λ is in principle possible. However,

Fig. 3. Plot of the parameter space in terms of relative hole size and normalized
wavelength divided into three regions by the boundaries deﬁned by VPCF = 1 and
VPCF = π. In the upper red area the mode penetrates deeply into the cladding
region and in lower blue region the structure supports a higher-order mode.

in some cases the guiding will be weak causing the mode to expand beyond the core
and into the cladding region [10, 11] corresponding to a low value of VPCF. In the other
extreme, the conﬁnement will be too strong allowing for the guiding of higher-order
modes [6, 7]. Since both situations are governed by VPCF the design relevant region in
a λ/Λ versus d/Λ plot can be deﬁned. This is done in Fig. 3 where the low limit is
chosen to be VPCF = 1 where wPCF/Λ ≃ 1. How large a mode that can be tolerated
is of course not unambiguous. However, for wPCF ∼ Λ leakage-loss typically becomes a
potential problem in PCFs with a ﬁnite cladding structure. In non-linear PCFs it is for
dispersion reasons often advantageous operating the PCF at VPCF . 1 and then a high
number of air-hole rings is needed to achieve an acceptable level of leakage loss [12].

Finally, we note that the practical operational regime is also limited from the low
wavelength side. In Ref. [13] a low-loss criterion was formulated in terms of the coupling
length zc = λ/[nFM(λ) − nFSM(λ)] between the FM and the FSM. In general scattering-
loss due to longitudinal non-uniformities increases when zc increases and a PCF with
a low zc will in general be more stable compared to one with a larger zc. Using nFM +
nFSM ≈ 2nFM ≈ 2nsilica we can rewrite Eq. (1) as

VPCF ∝ Λ

λ
zc(λ)

λ s

(2)

from which it is seen that a high value of the V –parameter is preferred over a smaller
value. In Fig. (3) it is thus preferable to stay close to the single-mode boundary (VPCF ∼
π) but in general there is a practical lower limit to the value of λ/Λ which can be realized
because when λ/Λ . 0.1 one generally has that zc ≫ λ [13].

4 V –parameter expression

Although the V –parameter oﬀers a simple way to design a PCF, a limiting factor for
using Eq. (1) is that a numerical method is still required for obtaining the eﬀective
indices. In analogy with expressions for standard ﬁbers [5] it would therefore be conve-
nient to have an alternative expression only dependent on the wavelength, λ, and the
structural parameters d and Λ. In Fig. 4, we show VPCF as function of λ/Λ (data are

and the result is indicated by the full red lines. Eq. (3a) is not based on considerations
of the physics of the V-parameter but merely obtained by trial and error in order to
obtain the best representation of calculated data with the lowest possible number of free
parameters. Prior to the ﬁt, the data sets are truncated at VPCF = 0.5 since wPCF & 2Λ
in this region (see left panel in Fig. 1) and the data is thus not practically relevant. In
Eq. (3a) the ﬁtting parameters A , B, and C depend on d/Λ only. In order to extract
this dependency, suitable functions (again obtained by trial and error) are ﬁtted to the
data sets for A , B, and C . We ﬁnd that the data are well described by the following

The above set of expressions, Eqs. (3), constitute our empirical expression for the V –
parameter in a PCF with λ/Λ and d/Λ being the only input parameters. For λ/Λ < 2
and VPCF > 0.5 the expression gives values of VPCF which deviates less than 3% from
the correct values obtained from Eq. (1).

5 Endlessly single-mode criterion

The term endlessly single-mode (ESM) refers to PCFs which regardless of wavelength
only support the two degenerate polarization states of the fundamental mode [14]. In

the framework of the V –parameter this corresponds to structures for which VPCF < π
for any λ/Λ [6]. As seen in the left panel of Fig. 1 this corresponds to suﬃciently small
air holes. However, from the plot in Fig. 1 it is quite diﬃcult to determine the exact
d/Λ value for which VPCF = π for λ approaching 0. From Eq. (3) it is easily seen that
the value may be obtained from

Fig. 5 illustrates this equation graphically where we have extrapolated the data in

that d/Λ ≃ 0.43 bounds the ESM regime. Solving Eq. (4) we get d/Λ ≃ 0.44 and the
deviation from the numerically obtained value is within the accuracy of the empirical
expression.

6 Conclusion

There are several issues to consider when designing a PCF. In this work we have ad-
dressed the single/multi-mode issue as well as those related to mode-ﬁeld radius/ﬁeld-
conﬁnement, and mode-spacing. We have shown how these properties can be quantiﬁed
via the V –parameter. Based on extensive numerics we have established an empirical
expression which facilitate an easy evaluation of the V -parameter with the normalized
wavelength and hole-size as the only input parameters. We believe that this expression
provides a major step away from the need of heavy numerical computations in design
of solid core PCFs with triangular air-hole cladding.

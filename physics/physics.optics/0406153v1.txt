We analyze theoretically the propagation of surface plasmon polaritons
about a metallic corner with a ﬁnite bend radius, using a one-dimensional
model analogous to the scattering from a ﬁnite-depth potential well. We
obtain expressions for the energy reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients in
the short wavelength limit, as well as an upper bound for the transmittance.
In certain cases we ﬁnd that propagation on non-planar interfaces may result
in lower losses than on ﬂat surfaces, contrary to expectation. In addition,
we also ﬁnd that the maximum transmittance depends non-monotonously on
the bend radius, allowing increased transmission with decreasing radius.

Structured materials which allow nanoscale control of light are necessary for achieving
compact integrated photonic devices. While the size of standard optical components and
beams is typically set by the diﬀraction limit, low dimensional excitations such as surface-
plasmon polaritons may be conﬁned to dimensions much smaller than the wavelength of
light. Surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs), coupled modes of plasmons and photons, are
excited when visible electromagnetic (EM) radiation couples into surface guided modes
at metal-dielectric interfaces [1, 2]. When propagating along ﬂat interfaces, these are
essentially two-dimensional (2D) waves, with an EM ﬁeld intensity which peaks at the
interface and decays exponentially into the two adjoining media.

Recently, SPP waveguiding and bending in nano-patterned metallic ﬁlms were studied
[3]. Alternately, it was shown that EM energy may be eﬃciently transported by near

1

ﬁeld coupling in plasmon waveguides comprised of ordered arrays of metal nanopar-
ticles [4]. Optical elements such as linear waveguides [5], mirrors, beamsplitters and
interferometers [6] were recently demonstrated.

Interestingly, while signiﬁcant progress has been made in understanding SPP propaga-
tion in nano-structures, certain fundamental issues pertaining to their guiding on smooth
metallic ﬁlms remain unknown. In particular, quantifying guiding and energy losses in
SPPs propagating around bends in metal-dielectric interfaces is of great importance, as
it should set a limit on feature size in certain plasmonic-circuit devices. Previously, the
problems of refraction [7] and reﬂection of SPPs [8] at interfaces have been addressed in
this context. In this Letter we present a study of the eﬃciency of SPP propagation at a
curved metal-dielectric interface in the short wavelength limit.

Figure 1: Cross-sectional (a) and top view (b) of the SPP intensity; (b) also shows
a drawing of the geometry. A metallic corner characterized by a dielectric
constant ǫi and Re[ǫi] < 0 has a bend angle θ > 90◦ and a ﬁnite bend radius
R. The bend is conﬁned to the region of space shown, with the center of
curvature at the origin. The rest of space is occupied by a dielectric with ǫo.
Axes x1 and x2 extend along the boundaries between Regions I and II and
Regions II and III, respectively. In the x1-x2 plane, Regions I and III are semi-
inﬁnite. The system is also inﬁnite in extent along the entire z axis. In (a)
we illustrate the single-mode approximation developed in the text: the ﬁeld
proﬁles in Regions I (solid line) and II (dashed), calculated for ωR/c = 800,
are well matched. In (b), the intensity is overlayed in grayscale, showing the
overlap with the metal (dielectric constant ǫi) and the outer dielectric (ǫo).
Arrows indicate incident and reﬂected ﬁelds in Region I, and transmitted ﬁeld
in Region III.

The geometry we study is that of propagation about a rounded edge, as shown in Fig.
1. SPPs are incident along the interface from Region I, and propagate counterclockwise
through the bend in Region II, in the direction of Region III. We calculate the energy-
reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients, as well as bend-induced radiation losses. For

2

lossy metals absorption losses are also evaluated.

Our approach exploits known expressions for the SPP ﬁelds in each region and matches
them at the two ends of the bend. The procedure diﬀers from related numerical tech-
niques [9] in that we consider the SPP itself as the incident wave, with the goal of
manipulating it as a well-deﬁned quasi-particle in a non-trivial geometry. Favorable
conditions for this will be seen to emerge in the short-wavelength limit, and we use this
to arrive at analytic expressions.

The solutions for SPP propagation on an inﬁnite ﬂat surface and on cylindrical surfaces
are known analytically [2]. On a ﬂat interface, SPPs at frequency ω are two dimensional
waves, decaying exponentially into the two adjoining media, with decay constants γi =
1/(ǫi + ǫo)/c in the dielectric. In
1 the interference of SPPs in Regions I and III is negligible, allowing

Solving exactly for the transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients requires matching an
inﬁnite number of solutions at the boundaries along the x1- and x2-axes separately.
However, it is possible to render this problem tractable by a few simple approximations.

in the short wavelength limit ωR/c

is approximately equal to Re[k]R.
In Region II the solution has angular momentum
proportional to the various n-values. Conservation of angular momentum dictates that
the incident SPP couple predominantly to that cylindrical mode with n closest in value to
kR. Therefore it is necessary to consider only a single term of the expansion. Formally,
and noting that it contains an element m which

role of angular momentum conservation in this matching problem is analogous to that

therefore necessary to match only a small number of solutions at a single point on each
axis, at a distance R from the origin. The boundary conditions are thus also satisﬁed
approximately over the entire extent of the axes. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the mode
mismatch at the boundaries may be very slight. The problem has now essentially become
one dimensional (1D), analogous to scattering from a 1D ﬁnite potential well [11]. Since
the allowed m-values are always complex, bound-state solutions in the well do not exist.
This distinguishes the SPP on a bent surface from waveguide bends enclosed on all sides
by inﬁnite potential walls [12].

Since the radiation carries angular momentum with respect to the origin, the energy
radiated into the far-ﬁeld from the surface at φ = 0 propagates at an angle φ0 with
respect to the x1 axis, setting the lower integration limit in (4). In the short-wavelength
limit only the amplitude of the forward-propagating mode is signiﬁcant, therefore the
radiation losses are well approximated by integrating only this mode. To obtain φ0 we use
a stationary phase approximation. The position-dependent phase is Φ = kor + Re[m]φ,
and the vector normal to a surface of constant phase is v(r) =
Φ = koˆr + Re[m]/rˆeφ.

in lower losses. We explain this counterintuitive result using an analogous picture of

curved interface sample less of the metal volume than that available when propagating
on a ﬂat interface, hence the reduced absorption.

predominantly to the fundamental modes, making the approach described above self-
15, and ǫo = 1, ∆2 = 0.002 for ωR/c = 800,
consistent. For example, when η = 3, ǫi =

rendering our result applicable. On the other hand, for ωR/c = 100 we obtain ∆2 = 0.3,
signifying that the expression is not reliable because the coupling to modes n other than
the fundamental can no longer be neglected. In this regime a more physical quantity is
the upper bound for the transmittance, given from (3) by

Tu = exp

2Im[m]θ

.

(6)

(cid:1)

(cid:0)−
Here we neglect reﬂections at the boundaries between the diﬀerent regions, thus exclud-
ing interference with the counter-propagating mode in Region II. To understand why
this is an upper bound, recall that in the wavelength range of interest, where the metal
is not very lossy, Im[n] > Im[m]. Since the wave depends on n as exp[
inφ], modes
with large Im[n] decay rapidly. Thus, the transmission in the presence of coupling to
non-fundamental modes does not exceed Tu, and the latter is a true upper bound. Fig. 2
is a plot of Tu. A peak is clearly visible, moving to higher values of R as the wavelength
increases. To the right of the peak, at large radii of curvature absorption losses in the
metal dominate, and the maximum transmittance decreases with increasing radius. To
the left of the peak radiation due to the high curvature is the dominant loss mechanism,
leading to a rapid drop in Tu. At very high curvature (R
10µm) there is a change
in trend, and Tu starts to increase with decreasing R (see Inset.) When calculating the
radiation loss per arclength, we ﬁnd that for this range of radii it increases slower than
elsewhere, allowing Tu to increase even as R attains very small values. This anomalous
behavior can be observed for all wavelengths, and is independent of the dispersion in
the metal.

The formalism developed here may also be used to analyze the complementary reversed
geometry, where the metal occupies three quadrants in space, and the SPPs propagate
around a dielectric void in it. Surprisingly, in this case we ﬁnd that in the single mode
approximation SPP propagation around the bend is non-radiative. Separate work will
address radiation and absorption processes in this system in greater detail.

In summary, we have analyzed the scattering of SPPs at a curved metal-dielectric
interface in the short wavelength limit. Utilizing an analogy to a quantum mechanical
1D ﬁnite square well we obtained the energy transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients.
Interestingly, propagation on a curved interface may result in lower losses than at a ﬂat
metallic surface, due to the unique ﬁeld distributions which arise in our system. An
expression for an upper bound on the transmittance was also obtained, showing that at
high curvature radiation is the main loss mechanism, while at low curvature material
losses dominate. An unexpected behavior where the maximum transmittance increases
with curvature was also observed. We explain this as an interplay between various loss
rates in the system. These results shed new light on the mesoscopic behavior of SPPs,
and should play an important role in the design and optimization of SPP devices. Future
work will address SPP propagation in waveguides, splitters and interferometers.

Analyzer Operated in an Asymmetrically Charged

Conﬁguration

Abstract

The electron optics of a 90 degree spherical deﬂecting analyzer (SDA-90) is

investigated with an imaging matrix formalism. As a preanalyzer in the UTA-

neutrino experiment, high transmission and reasonable energy resolution are the

choices of optimization. The magniﬁcation of the source through the analyzer plays

the key role in determining the energy resolution. The imaging matrix approach

provides graphical information to facilitate such an evaluation. We can demonstrate

that in case where the analyzer is asymmetrically charged, the rotation of the image

helps increase both transmission probability and resolution. A telefocus electron

gun is used to check the numerical result, and to investigate the transverse focusing

behavior.

1 Introduction

Direct measurements of the neutrino mass face the challenge of interpreting a convoluted

spectrum to very high precision. The negative mass square issue prevails [1] [2] [3] [4]

while the request for higher resolution presses on. The spectrometer function plays a key

role in deciphering the mystery, but often the convolution of the ﬁnite source volume is

not easy to take into account[5]. In the UTA experiment, the resolution is set to reach the

10−5 level while suﬃcient counts must be recorded to suppress statistical uncertainties.

A 90 degree spherical analyzer (SDA) is designed as a preanalyzer for the UTA neutrino

mass experiment. This analyzer has to provide a

3.5◦ acceptance cone for the beta

±

particles (electrons) emitted from a cell positioned along the symmetrical axis. All the

emission from within the fudiciary source volume is expected to be imaged through a

narrow ring slit. This image will serve as the source for a high resolution cylindrical mirror

analyzer(CMA). The ring slit of the SDA controls the ﬂow of tritium gas emanating from

the cell and cuts out the low or high energy tail of the distribution function for the CMA.

The SDA-90 provides high luminosity, narrow throughput image and reasonable energy

resolution, characterizing a focusing analyzer. Using the SDA as a focusing instrument

was ﬁrst proposed by Aston [6] and later investigated by Purcell analytically based on

trajectory analysis[7]. Ashby then included relativistic corrections [8], but left out fringe

eﬀects. Kessler et al. formulated a mathematical model for the fringe eﬀects, but due to

the limitation of their instrument, only ﬁrst order focusing was seen in their experiment[9].

The second order focusing was included in the design of Ross et al. by adding two Herzog

lenses to adjust the fringe ﬁelds[10]. An important feature of that design was that the

analyzer was asymmetrically charged. In this investigation we verify that we can maintain

second-order focusing which is not sensitive to the positions of emitters. Regarding the

3

spherical aberration as a minor eﬀect, the imaging property of the analyzer has been

further investigated. A SDA of very similar design by Ross et al. has been built, and our

simulation results were checked using a telefocus electron gun as the source.

2 Theoretical Background

Theoretical studies of the electron optics of an analyzer is generally based on trajectory

analysis. When an analytic form of a trajectory is available, it generally can be represented

in the form

L = L (θ, n, k)

(1)

where L is the projection of the ﬂight path from the source to the image onto the sym-

metric axis, θ is the azimuthal angle of the incident trajectory, n characterizes the source

position, and k accounts for the voltage conﬁguration of the analyzer and the kinetic

energy of the electrons. Similar to the optical axis in light optics, the principle trajectory

is deﬁned as the orbit of the electrons which goes along the geometrical central path from

the source through the analyzer. For a point emitter, the deviations from the principle

trajectory due to angular dispersion and energy dispersion can be expressed through a

Taylor expansion

(2)

The ﬁrst term of Eq.(2) characterizes the spherical aberration, while the second term

characterizes the energy dispersion in the image plane. The ‘mixed’ term R is generally

not important if the spectra to be analyzed is not continuous over a large range. The

energy dispersion is deﬁned as

D = E0 (∂L/∂E)

(3)

Often the source can not be considered as a point. For a ﬁnite source ( size l ) the

resolution of the analyzer can be modeled as

and the transmission density is given by

T =

N ′Ω
8π2 (Mll + ∆L) R

where N ′ is the number of total electrons emitted per sec, Ω is the solid angle of the ac-

ceptance cone, Ml is the lateral magniﬁcation, and R is the radius of the ring image. In a

resolution optimized analyzer, large energy dispersion and small aberration are the main

targets. The source size can be limited by an entrance aperture if the source intensity

is suﬃcient. Otherwise, the ﬁnite size eﬀect must be seriously considered. The spherical

aberration can be investigated by minimizing ∆L with respect to the input angular spread

∆θ. To ﬁrst order, i.e. the ﬁrst order focusing, the coeﬃcient of the µ = 1 term in Eq.(2)

has to be zero. Second order focusing requires µ = 1 and µ = 2 terms to be zero. Princi-

pally three free parameters allow us to achieve third order focusing, but in practice usually

only ﬁrst order focusing is available due to the fact that the focusing behavior depends

strongly only on the voltage conﬁguration of the analyzer. In a transmission optimized

analyzer, large acceptance (Ω) and source size (l) are required so that more particles can

be accepted by the analyzer. When the spherical aberration is controlled such that the

size of the aberration is smaller than the image of the ﬁnite source, demagniﬁcation is

favored to keep high transmission.

Lacking graphical illustration, pure trajectory analysis does not volunteer all the in-

formation for optimization. For instance, it has been pointed out by Hafner et al.

[11]

that the minimum beam-width does not always occur at the image in the case of sec-

ond order focusing, but that the beam can be narrower before it comes to focus at the

5

image. More importantly, practical applications involve the fringe ﬁelds which often can

not be modeled properly, and even when they do, the analytical equations become too

complicated for intuitive interpretation.

With the advent of modern computers, Poisson equation can be solved numerically

using ﬁnite diﬀerence or ﬁnite element methods. The trajectories of charged particles can

be calculated very accurately assuming that the boundaries of the ﬁelds are properly setup,

the integrating steps are reasonably ﬁne, and convergence tests are performed during the

integration. Thus, it is possible to include the fringe ﬁelds and their use to minimize

the aberration by tracing the minimum beam-width numerically. New, superior modes of

operation can be found through this method and by adding entrance and exit lenses, the

image quality can be ﬁne-tuned[10]. The ‘minimum-width’ ray tracing is often performed

either along the symmetric axis or its perpendicular plane to study the aberration. As far

as we know, most published results focused their attentions on the spherical aberration

behavior only. The electron optical behavior of analyzers has several distinct features

which are not seen in the performance of rotationally symmetric systems, as can be

seen in the development of electron microscope [12]. Due to the fact that the principle

trajectory is curved in the analyzer, the up-down symmetry is broken. This has several

signiﬁcant consequences. For example, in rotationally symmetric system, the second-

order spherical aberration is eliminated by symmetry; while in curved system all orders of

spherical aberration can be present. The astigmatism in rotationally symmetric system

is only a second-order eﬀect; in curved system it is intrinsic. The spherical aberrations

in curved system can easily be very signiﬁcant, even overpowering the ﬁnite size eﬀect,

unless special eﬀorts are made to suppress them. It was found by Ross et al.[10] that

the aberration behavior can be controlled by adding Herzog lenses to modify the fringe

ﬁelds of the analyzer. We found that even when the source is moved signiﬁcantly along

6

the principle trajectory, the aberration of the SDA remains in the same mode. Thus we

are able to regard the spherical aberration as a minor eﬀect once second-order focusing is

achieved, and advance our prescription to include the magniﬁcation of the ﬁnite source.

As will be shown later, the image plane in the curved system may not be perpendicular

to the principle trajectory. The magniﬁcation factor will be more properly presented by

a matrix rather than a scalar. Therefore looking in only one direction in the ray-tracing

results will not provide the full information of the imaging process. This is even more

relevant when an asymmetric ﬁeld is applied along the ﬂight path. The rotation of the

image by the asymmetric ﬁelds can improve the resolution compared to the symmetrical

conﬁguration.

We extend the scalar ﬁeld representation of Eqs.(3) and (4) to a vector ﬁeld representation

expressed as

Xi = mijxj + εijkxjxk + γijklxjxkxl + ...

(6)

To the ﬁrst order, the image is constructed by linear mapping of the object. Thus mij

can be represented by a matrix which characterizes the imaging properties. To higher

order, non-vanishing εijk , γijkl ... terms carry the information on geometric aberrations.

Although the formulation does not include the spherical (angular) aberration, this eﬀect

can be easily taken into account as a universal blurring in the image. Aberration is

included in ﬁrst order imaging as

Xi = mijxj ±

∆i (α)

(7)

where ∆ depends only on the acceptance half angle (α) of the instrument. In our case,

α = 3.5◦ and l = 0.5mm, less than 5% contribution to the minimum beam width is based

on the aberration after the second order focusing is achieved. To determine the matrix

elements, point sources positioned along several x positions are set up as the input rays for

the instrument. After the rays within an emission angle ˜α traverse through the analyzing

ﬁeld, each bundle of exit rays are traced to ﬁnd the minimum ‘beam-width’, establishing

the image position. It is worth mentioning that in preparing the input condition, ˜α should

not be too big, for the aberration may eﬀect the result. We choose to take the semi-angle

8

(9)

˜α =0.65◦, 15 rays, and ∆r (∆z) = 1mm for all simulation in this investigation. In our

SDA-90, the incident angle is 48◦, and the exit angle is 42◦. (Fig. 1). Following the

convention used by Ross et al., the source coordinate is deﬁned as d~l = d~r + d~z, and the

image coordinate d~L = d ~R + d ~Z respectively. The imaging matrix m relates the source

vector to the image vector as

The magniﬁcation factor M can be calculated as √∆R2 + ∆Z 2/√∆r2 + ∆z2. For a unit

vector perpendicular to the incident beam trajectory(principle ray), the lateral magniﬁ-

To calculate the resolution, the dispersive curve at the proximity of the image point has to

be calculated. This can be achieved easily by carrying out the ray tracing for a bundle of

rays with the same input conditions but diﬀerent energies. The energy dispersion due to

the analyzing ﬁeld can be calculated by taking cuts on the ray bundle along

n direction at

the proximity of the image. When α is large, including the defocusing eﬀect, the chromatic

b

images of diﬀerent energy bundle emerging from the same source point must be traced.

Again all the chromatic images line up linearly based on the ﬁrst order approximation.

3.2 Results and Discussions

Table I shows the results obtained at three source positions that are relevant to us by

the techniques outlined above for the symmetric and asymmetric modes. The voltage

settings are optimized according to the aberration curve such that second order focusing

is obtained in both modes. Note that while the overall maginifaction factors (M) in the

asymmetric mode may be larger, the lateral magniﬁcation factors (Ml) are always smaller

than those in the symmetric mode. A series of evaluations was done at source positions

from s =

180mm to s = 80mm. Figure 3 shows the graphical representation of the

−

results. Rotation of image happens in both cases. In the symmetric mode, however, the

rotation (presented by the dashed lines) is pretty much conﬁned to the same quadrant,

although an inversion is caused by the fringe ﬁelds when the source is placed so close

that higher order eﬀects contribute signiﬁcantly. Figure 4 details the imaging properties

for both operational modes. We found that the asymmetric mode generally provides a

smaller Ml (remember this is the projection of the image perpendicular to the principle

trajectory) thanks to the rotation of image. That is to say, the charged particle ﬂux

will be better focused seen by a slit mounted perpendicularly to the principle trajectory,

leading to higher transmission. Due to the fact that part of the image will not lie in

the slit plane, some defocusing broadening will happen. The defocusing eﬀect involves

the extension of the source image along the principle trajectory and the angular spread

of the ﬂux. Both factors in the asymmetric mode enhance the defocusing broadening of

the outgoing ﬂux. However since the size of the image is so small, for reasonable angular

10

dispersion, the defocusing broadening is insigniﬁcant.

The dramatic changes for s > 50mm in the magniﬁcation factor and orientation of

the images ( Figs. 3, 4(b)(d)) are due to the presence of fringe ﬁelds. Particularly in the

symmetric case, it creates long tails in the transmission function which are not easy to

control. Figure 5 depicts the resolution D−1 = Ml(

E

n) as a function of the source

∇

·

position for both modes. The resolution of the analyzer is the same for both cases when the

b

source is exactly on the symmetric axis(s = 0). For s > 0 the resolution of the asymmetric

mode is better; while for s < 0 the symmetric mode is preferred. In the UTA neutrino

unit, the source is a cylindrical cell, 32 mm wide, 35.5 mm high with a ring opening of

0.5mm. Most of the beta ﬂux will come from the s = 0mm to s = 21.5mm sector in the

cell. Operating the analyzer in asymmetric mode will improve the transmission by

23%

∼

and resolution by

4% at the stage as an preanalyzer. Since the resolution of the CMA

∼

depends linearly on the size of lateral image formed by SDA, the overall resolution of the

system gained by operating the SDA in asymmetric mode is over 50%. In the course of

this investigation, changing the source position did not alter the second order focusing

in either case. When the source is positioned in the ﬁeld free region, the position of the

image is largely decided by the analyzing ﬁelds provided by SDA. Tests were carried out to

check the inﬂuence of biasing voltages of the SDA and the Herzog lenses on the position

of the image for both symmetric and antisymmetric cases. Same amount of voltage is

added or subtracted from SDA and lenses up to hundreds of volts. The image shift due to

modiﬁed Herzog lenses is an order of magnitude smaller than equivalently modiﬁed SDA

ﬁelds. However, the fringe ﬁelds between the lenses and SDA will change the aberration

curve completely, and participate strongly in the rotation of images. Fundamentally, the

rotation during the imaging is an inherent property for any curved optical system, and

its treatment can still reside in the general paraxial principle with special care for its

11

vectorial nature.

4 Experiments

A Steigerwald type gun [13] is chosen as an electron beam source because the monochro-

maticity of the beam is better than 0.01% [14] and an adjustable real image, created

beyond the electron gun by telefocusing, can be used as the input object for the SDA.

The electron source is used to measure the action of the dispersive ﬁeld of the SDA, and

thus makes the veriﬁcation of the calculated imaging property of the SDA possible. While

the position of the object moves–by adjusting the position of the inner Wehnelt cylinder

of the gun–the image is traced both vertically and horizontally. Since the object will be

in the proximity of the symmetric axis, the SDA will form a slightly magniﬁed lateral

image in the vertical direction.

4.1 Setup

A self-biasing electron gun based on Steigerwald’s design is mounted on a rotatable frame

under the SDA-90. The incidence angle of the gun can be adjusted. A Faraday cage

mounted at the entrance of SDA, 16mm oﬀset from symmetrical axis, with 50 micron

aperture facing the incident e-beam acts as a beam ‘checker’. Passing the SDA-90, the

electrons face a similar Faraday cage(detector) which is mounted on another rotatable

frame with moving mechanisms which allow the cage to move in the plane perpendicular

to the exit beam. The two rotating frames are aligned horizontally by a digital indicator to

better than 1 arc minute. In the vertical direction two axes are aligned optically through

a laser beam deﬁned by two apertures and a photodiode with a 100 micron entrance

aperture. The accuracy is within 50 micron. The setup is detailed in Figure 6. The

12

incidence angle of the gun is ﬁrst ﬁxed by the ‘checker’. Then the gun is rotated 90◦ to

allow the beam to go through the SDA. By adjusting the position of the inner Wehnelt

cone of the electron gun, beams with diﬀerent sizes and points of convergence can be

created. The beam proﬁles are ﬁrst measured with the beam checker before entering the

SDA, and later the exit beam proﬁles are measured again. The checker only measures the

horizontal beam-width; while the detector measures both horizontal and vertical proﬁles.

The cage current is measured by a Ketheley 616 multi-meter followed by a Dell P100

computer through GPIBs. The power supply of the electron gun is Spellman RHSR60N.

A Bertan 205B power supply sets the voltage of the inner sphere of SDA, and a Fluke 408B

power supply for Herzogs lenses. The beam intensities range from 2 to 6 micro-amps. The

whole chamber is maintained at

10−6 Torr. The vacuum tank is shielded by mu-metal

2
∼

×

and the transverse magnetic ﬁelds are measured to be in the range of mGauss.

4.2 Results

The principle trajectory is determined by the incidence angle of the electron beam, the

checker’s z position, the inclination angle of the detector, and the detector Z position.

The voltages of the SDA and Herzog lenses are set according to the simulation. The

variables are the azimuthal position of the detector and the incident energy of the electron.

Although the electron energy can be recored to 6 digit precision by a diﬀerential voltmeter,

its absolute value can only be read out in three signiﬁcant digits. The agreement between

the relativistic numerical calculation and the experimental results of the electron energy is

within 0.5%. We also found that the principle trajectory is rather insensitive to the voltage

setting of the two Herzog lenses. The beam envelopes under investigation all have excellent

gaussian shape(Fig. 6). No observable baseline ﬂuctuation appears in the measured beam

intensity. The energy resolution of the analyzer is measured by adjusting the incident

13

beam energy from 19940 eV to 20060 eV, such that the gaussian beam can scan through

the detecting aperture. Depicted in Figure 8, the full width at half maximum(FWHM) of

the beam proﬁle deﬁnes the energy resolution to be ∆E/E = 2.47

10−3. This is measured

×

at incident beam size of 634 micron and exit beam size of 726 micron. The beam spread

is only 2.5 mrad; thus no angular aberration is seen. Since ∆E/E = Ml(

E

n)/E,

∇

·

inferred by this result,

E

n = 68eV /mm. This measurement agrees with the ray trace

b

∇

·

result (70eV /mm) very well. The focusing property of the SDA is elucidated in terms of

b

the ratios of the beam-widths measured before and after the SDA. Depicted in Figures

9 and 10, both vertical and horizontal lateral beam-widths were measured, at z = 87.35

by the checker and at Z = 522.52mm by the detector. Since the ray-tracing predicted

several optical properties of the SDA very well, we use the beam-width ratio to calculate

the position of the object. Particularly we examine the data obtained by setting inner

Wehnelt position marked 0.

In Figure 9, vertically the detector measures 726 micron

lateral beam-width (FWHM) while the input beam-width is 634 micron (beam spread

3.12 mrad, point of convergence is 203mm ahead of the checker, based on the previous

measurements on the focusing property of telefocus gun. ) at the checker. Applying

the simulation results in Figure 4 and taking into account the modiﬁcation due to the

defocusing, the object is found at z = 61.2mm, and correspondingly the image is at

Z = 483mm. ( Complete results see the previous article.) This result will on one hand

be used in the previous article as another supporting evidence for the proper analysis of

the emission optics of the Steigerwald type electron gun; on the other hand the focusing

property of the horizontal direction, which is not calculated in the 2D ray tracing, can be

constructed. From the same input beam, the detector receives a horizontal beam-width

of 804 micron(FWHM)( Figure 10). Based on the conservation of brightness, the beam

dispersion angle in this direction is estimated to be 3.49 mrad. This puts an upper limit

14

1.27 on the lateral magniﬁcation factor in the horizontal direction. Thus separate images

will form vertically and horizontally , featuring the astigmatism of the SDA. However,

since eventually a ring source will be used in the experiment, we have to look at the

vertical image only. The ratio of beam-widths measured in both directions is close to 1;

this suggests that the broadening in the ring image due to the horizontal defocusing will

not be signiﬁcant in our case. This astigmatism is often unchecked by two dimensional ray

tracing for cylindrically symmetric analyzers and thus could cause anomalous broadening

in practice[15].

5 Conclusion

In this work, we have used the imaging matrix as a tool to evaluate the resolution and

transmission characteristics of a spherical deﬂecting analyzer. Results are shown for both

symmetrically and asymmetrically charged cases. The asymmetrical case is found to be

superior. A SDA-90 has been built based on the simulations. The principle trajectory and

the dispersion ﬁeld are checked by experiment using a telefocus gun as the beam source.

Many details made possible by the imaging matrices provides a straightforward database

for convoluting the spectrometer function into the ﬁnite source. Although extensive liter-

ature is available on this topic, their results contribute mainly to cases where the source

is small. Thus the aberration behavior is the key element to optimize the resolution.

Typically a third order aberration curve from analyzer of our size (

50cm ) has second

∼

order focus of 20 micron. For any ﬁnite source which is larger than 50 micron, the ﬁnite

size eﬀect often dominates, and the optimization based on the aberration only may not

be correct. The imaging matrix approach proposed here provide a way of dealing with

such problems.

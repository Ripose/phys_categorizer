Abstract

We investigate the ray dynamics in an optical cavity when a ray splitting mechanism
is present. The cavity is a conventional two-mirror stable resonator and the ray splitting
is achieved by inserting an optical beam splitter perpendicular to the cavity axis. Using
Hamiltonian optics, we show that such a simple device presents a surprisingly rich chaotic
ray dynamics.

In this Letter we present a very simple optical cavity whose ray dynamics is nevertheless

fully chaotic. Our starting point is the fact that a two-mirror optical cavity can be stable or

unstable depending on its geometrical conﬁguration.1 If a light ray is injected inside the cavity

it will remain conﬁned indeﬁnitely when the conﬁguration is stable but it will escape after a

ﬁnite number of bounces when the cavity is unstable. Our interest is in a cavity which has

both aspects of stability and instability (Fig 1). The cavity is modelled as a strip resonator1

made of two identical concave mirrors of radius of curvature R separated by a distance L,

where L < 2R so that the cavity is globally stable. We then introduce a beam splitter (BS)

inside the cavity, oriented perpendicular to the optical axis. In this way the BS deﬁnes two

planar-concave subcavities: one on the left and one on the right with respect to the BS, with

length L1 and L2, respectively. The main idea is that depending on the position of the BS the

left (right) subcavity becomes unstable for the reﬂected rays when L1 (L2) is bigger than R,

while the cavity as a whole remains always stable (L1 + L2 < 2R).

Consideration of this system raises the nontrivial question whether there will be an ”equi-

librium” between the number of trapped rays and escaping rays. The trapped rays are those

which bounce for inﬁnitely long times due to the global stability of the cavity and the escaping

ones are those which stay only for a ﬁnite time. If such equilibrium exists it could eventually

lead to transient chaos since it is known in literature that instability (positive Lyapunov ex-

ponents) and mixing (conﬁnement inside the system) form the skeleton of chaotic dynamics.2

In this Letter we show that under certain conditions such equilibrium can be achieved in our

cavity and that chaotic ray dynamics is displayed

In our system the BS plays a crucial role. It is modelled as a stochastic ray splitting element

by assuming the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients as random variables.3 Within the con-

text of wave optics this model corresponds to the neglect of all interference phenomena inside

the cavity, as required by the ray (zero-wavelength) limit. The stochasticity is implemented by

using a Monte Carlo method to determine whether the ray is transmitted or reﬂected.3 When

a ray is incident on the ray splitting surface of the BS, it is either transmitted through it, with

probability p, or reﬂected with probability 1 − p, where we assume p = 1/2 for a 50/50 beam

splitter as shown in Fig 1. We then dynamically evolve a ray and at each reﬂection we use a

random number generator with a uniform distribution to randomly decide whether to reﬂect

or transmit the incident ray.

In the context of Hamiltonian optics, to characterize the trajectory of a ray we ﬁrst choose

a reference plane perpendicular to the optical axis ˆZ, coinciding with the surface of the BS.

The intersection of a ray with this plane is speciﬁed by two parameters: the height y above

the optical axis and the angle θ between the trajectory and the same axis. We consider the

2

rays as point particles, as in standard billiard theory where the propagation of rays correspond

to the trajectories of unit mass point particles moving freely inside the billiard and reﬂecting

elastically at the boundary. In particular, we study the evolution of the transversal component

of the momentum of the ray, i.e. vy = |~v| sin(θ) so that we associate a ray of light with the

two-dimensional vector ~r = (y, vy). It is important to stress that we use exact 2D-Hamiltonian

optics, i.e. we do not use the paraxial approximation.

The evolution of a set of rays injected in the cavity with diﬀerent initial conditions (y0, vy0), is

obtained by using a ray tracing algorithm. For each initial condition, the actual ray trajectory

is determined by a random sequence {...rrttrrrrt..} which speciﬁes if the ray is reﬂected (r)

or transmitted (t) by the BS. When one evolves the whole set of initial conditions, one can

choose between two possibilities, either use the same random sequence for all rays in the set

of initial conditions or use a diﬀerent random sequence for each ray. In this Letter we use the

same random sequence for all injected rays in order to uncover the dynamical randomness of

the cavity.

The three quantities that we have calculated to demonstrate the chaotic ray dynamics inside

the cavity are the Poincar´e Surface of Section (SOS), the exit basin diagrams and the escape

time function.4 In all calculations we have assumed L1 +L2 = 0.16m and the radius of curvature

of the mirrors R = 0.15m; the diameter d of the two mirrors was d = 0.05m. In addition, the

displacement ∆ of the BS with respect to the center of the cavity was chosen as 0.02m (unless

speciﬁed otherwise), and the time was measured in number of bounces n.
In Fig. 2, the successive intersections of a ray with initial transverse coordinates y0 = 1×10−5m,

vy0 = 0 are represented by the black points in the SOSs. For ∆ = 0 the cavity conﬁguration is

symmetric and the dynamics is completely regular (Fig.2(a)); the on-axis trajectory represents

an elliptic ﬁxed point and nearby stable trajectories lie on continuous tori in phase space. In

Fig.2(b), the BS is slightly displaced from the center (∆ = 0.02m), the same initial trajectory

becomes unstable and spreads over a ﬁnite region of the phase space before escaping after a

3

large number of bounces (n = 75328). In view of the ring structure of Fig.2(b) we may qualify

the motion as azimuthally ergodic. The fact that the ray-splitting mechanism introduced by

the BS produces ergodicity is a well known result for a closed billard.3 We ﬁnd here an analogue

phenomenon, with the diﬀerence that in our case the trajectory does not explore uniformly but

only azimuthally the available phase space, as an apparent consequence of the openness of the

system.

It is well known that chaotic hamiltonian systems with more than one exit channel exhibit

irregular escape dynamics which can be displayed, e.g., by plotting the exit basin diagram.5

In our system, this diagram was constructed by deﬁning a ﬁne grid (2200 × 2200) of initial

conditions (y0, vy0). Each ray is followed until it escapes from the cavity. When it escapes from

above (vy > 0) we plot a black dot in the corresponding initial condition, whereas when it

escapes from below (vy < 0) we plot a white dot. This is shown in Fig.3, the uniform regions in

the exit basin diagram correspond to rays which display a regular dynamics, whereas the dusty

regions correspond to portions of phase space where there is sensitivity to initial conditions,

since two initially nearby points can escape from opposite exits. Moreover, in Fig.3 one can

see how the boundary between black and white regions becomes less and less smooth as one

approaches the center of these diagrams. It is known that this boundary is actually a fractal

set6 whose convoluted appearance is a typical feature of chaotic scattering systems.7

Besides sensitivity to initial conditions, another fundamental ingredient of chaotic dynamics

is the presence of inﬁnitely long living orbits which are responsible for the mixing properties of

the system. This set of orbits is usually called repeller,8 and is fundamental to generate a truly

chaotic scattering system. To verify the existence of this set we have calculated the escape time

or time delay function9 for a one-dimensional set of initial conditions speciﬁed by the initial

position y0 (impact parameter) taken on the mirror M1 and the initial velocity vy0 = 0. The

4

escape time was calculated in the standard way, as the time (in number of bounces n) it takes

a ray to escape from the cavity.

Fig.4(a) shows the escape time function. The singularities of this function are a clear signature

of the existence of long living orbits and the presence of peaks followed by ﬂat regions are a

signature of the exponential sensitivity to initial conditions. In order to verify the presence

of an inﬁnite set of long living orbits, we have zoomed in on the set of impact parameters y0

in three diﬀerent intervals (Fig. 4(b), (c) and (d)). Each zoom reveals the existence of new

inﬁnitely long living orbits. Inﬁnite delay times correspond to orbits that are asymptotically

close to an unstable periodic orbit. If we would continue to increase the resolution we would

ﬁnd more and more inﬁnitely trapped orbits. The repeated existence of singular points is a

signature of the mixing mechanism of the system due to the global stability of the cavity.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that our simple optical system displays chaotic ray

dynamics. It is important to stress that a key component for the development of chaos is the

inclusion of non-paraxial rays which add the mixing properties to the system.10 In fact, it has

been previously shown that paraxial ray dynamics can be unstable but not chaotic, in systems

with stochastic perturbations.11, 12

In our case, it is the stochastic ray splitting mechanism

induced by the BS that destroys the regular motion of rays in the globally stable (but non-

paraxial) cavity, as shown by the SOSs. Moreover, by calculating the exit basin diagrams we

have found that they show fractal boundaries, which is a typical feature of chaotic ray dynam-

ics.5 Finally, through the singularities in the escape time function, we have veriﬁed the presence

of inﬁnitely long living orbits, which in turns reveal the mixing mechanism of our optical cavity.

An experimental conﬁrmation of the fractal properties of the exit basin can be performed, e.g.,

in the way suggested in,7 by injecting a narrow laser beam into the cavity either in a regular or

in a dusty region of phase space. In the former case one expects the beam to leave the cavity

either from above or below, while in the latter case both exits should appear illuminated. This

5

proposed experiment is fully within the context of geometrical optics (interference plays no

role) so that our stochastic model of the BS is adequate.

Abstract

The bright soliton in optical ﬁber is generally investigated via its spatial evo-

lution in the time domain, where its waveform is considered in many studies.

To be consistent with the well-established picture of the dynamics of solitons

in other systems, in this letter, we propose it is helpful to study the temporal

evolution of the bright soliton by examining its waveshape propagating along

the space coordinate axis. We develop a singular theory. Equations governing

the evolution of the parameters of the bright soliton in the slow time and the

radiated ﬁeld are explicitly formulated for the ﬁrst time. In addition, localized

modes are found to appear.

PACS (numbers): 03.40.Kf, 52.35.Mw, 42.65.Tg

Owing to the promising application to long distance soliton-based communication and

the great fundamental interest of physics of the process involved, solitary waves and solitons

in the nonlinear monomode optical ﬁber have received intensive studies in recent years [1,2].

The generalized propagation equation of optical ﬁeld in the ﬁber takes the form

in which x′ represents the propagation distance, t′ the time and u′ the complex ﬁeld envelope.

Usually, εP ′ [u], including linear loss, high-order dispersion and other nonlinear eﬀects, is

1

assumed to be small and treated as perturbations to place emphasis on important phenomena

of the bright and dark solitons in the ﬁber [3]. In the region of anomalous group-velocity

dispersion (GVD), by introducing the retarded time T ′ = t′

k1x′ = t′

version supports distortionless propagation of a type of solitary wave called the bright or

temporal soliton [3].

Generally, waves travelling along the x-axis at speed v are expressible as functions of

(x

vt). A wave F (x, t) may be thought of as formed from the shape f (ζ) by the substitution

−
ζ = (x

−

vt), or else as built from the time signal h(τ ) by the substitution τ = (t

x/v).

−

Here, the function f (ζ) with f (x) = F (x, 0) characterizes the “waveshape”, and h(τ ) with

h(t) = F (0, t) depicts the “waveform” [4]. Resulting pictures from the two standpoints

for the wave F (x, t) are that the “waveshape” changes and propagates along the x-axis

as time elapses and the “waveform” distorts versus the retarded time τ as the distance x

keep increasing. These actually presents two diﬀerent point of views for the visualization of

scenario of soliton under perturbations.

The bright soliton propagating in the ﬁber governed by Eq. (2) was typically investigated

by interchanging the roles of the retarded time T and the space x′′ and deﬁning an “initial-

value” problem, or equivalently by directly treating the space x′′ as the evolution coordinate

and deﬁning a boundary-value problem. Accordingly, the aspect of waveform of the bright

soliton was taken into consideration and studies could beneﬁt from the direct application [5,6]

of the celebrated frameworks developed by Zakharov and Shabat (ZS) and Ablowitz-Kaup-

Newell-Segur (AKNS). Nevertheless, to avoid complication of the ZS and AKNS schemes,

other elaborate approaches were developed in the framework of direct expansion as well [7,8].

In contrast to the studies of bright soliton, the aspect of waveshape is extensively ex-

2

amined in other soliton problems with perturbations [6], including envelope soliton of the

integrable cubic NLSE in water and other applications [9,10]. Although results for the under-

standing of the waveform of bright soliton have been achieved, a natural question, how the

waveshape evolves in the real time or what the dynamics of bright soliton is, is inevitable to

arise. To answer this question, the corresponding mathematical model is essentially diﬀerent

from the one investigated in previous theories, and is also intractable in the ZS and AKNS

schemes. Consequently, a new theoretical challenge turns up. In this letter, we introduce

our theory for the subject.

Let’s start from the dimensionless form of Eq. (1) in the anomalous dispersion regime

in existing theories, a characteristic time, namely t0 that is determined by the working

wavelength and nature of the ﬁber, is used in the normalization. Formally, Eq. (3) diﬀers

from Eq. (2) or the normal form of optical NLSE only by an additional term iut due to

invalidation of the retarded time, but the essential diﬀerence lies in that the time t here

must be treated as the evolution coordinate and an initial-value problem is consequently

deﬁned, since the waveshape of bright soliton is to be taken into account. In the absence of

perturbations, the bright soliton admitted by Eq. (3) is given by

From the general point of view of solitons under perturbations, if the perturbations turn

on, the bright soliton with a starting state of Eq. (5) to propagate in the ﬁber governed

by Eq. (3) can not be described by Eq. (4), it undergoes a slow change in the time via

the variation of its parameters. Moreover, other wave modes come on to appear [6,11]. To

characterize the picture, we introduce a slow time scale t1 = εt and assume that the solution

of Eq. (3) is of the form

u(t, z, t1) = [2ηf (z) + εv(t, z, t1)]e−iθ(z,t1)

ε−1θ0 −

the coordinate variable in the reference frame tied up to the bright soliton. Here, if we take

t, z and t1 in place of t and x as new independent variables, the derivatives with respect to

time and space in Eq. (3) are thus replaced by

Introducing Eqs.

(6)-(8) into Eq.

(3), we transform from

the laboratory frame into the soliton’s one and get two equations from O(1) and O(ε),

respectively. Examining the zeroth-order equation for O(1), we derive Λ = (2ζ + 1)−1,

θ0t1 = Ω = 2(ζ 2 + η2)Λ and K = (ζ 2

the ﬁrst-order equation for O(ε) as

linearization. Here, we should note that although the basic idea of the present linearization is

a natural extension of the normal scheme of multiple scale expansion [12], the implementation

of the idea in handling such soliton problems as of the second order derivative with respect

to time is original. As usual, extra freedoms for the purpose of preventing the occurrence of

secular terms are introduced and included in the source term. Taking advantage of Laplace

to appear in the solution, which is essentially diﬀerent from the envelope soliton of the

integrable cubic NLSE with the ﬁrst-order temporal derivative [14]. From our viewpoint,

the localized modes here is a kind of internal modes whose occurrence is acknowledged to

be intrinsic for nonintegrable models, for instance, the φ4 model [15]. Although it is not

suﬃcient to conclude that the model we consider here is nonintegrable, the corresponding

Lax representation is really diﬃcult to ﬁnd. Returning to the restriction condition imposed

on the solution, we indicate that they can be satisﬁed by the extra freedoms we introduce

in advance. In fact, they result in a sequence of novel equations

From Eq. (25), we compute ηt1 =

by integration. In this case, Λ remains constant, thus, the propagation distance of a ﬁxed

point of the soliton is calculated by x = Λt. As a result, we can write

η = η0e−2εα1x,

which recovers a well-known result in previous theories [1].

Secondly, we give a brief study of the perturbation P [u] =

for the Raman eﬀect. Using Eq. (7), we derive Im(P eiθ) =

inﬂuence on the soliton’s width and velocity. By Eq. (29), we get wt1 =

which exhibits that the soliton is narrowed under this eﬀect. As well, we can derive that

the velocity decreases, obeying

Λ = Λ0[1 +

Under the picture of waveform, the width is depicted diﬀerently, and the velocity of dynamic

sense can not be deﬁned.

In conclusion, we think that the waveshape presents a more transparent picture of directly

physical signiﬁcance than the waveform, especially in the study of soliton under perturba-

tions. Hence, we believe that our theory is a nontrivial and necessary alternative for the

subject. Moreover, the mathematical development in this paper is distinct and normal, its

idea is helpful for the study of other soliton problems as well.

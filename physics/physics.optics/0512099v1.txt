With reference to spatially non-local nematic liquid crystals, we develop a theory of optical spa-
tial solitons and modulational instability in anisotropic media with arbitrarily large birefringence.
Asymmetric spatial proﬁles and multivalued features are predicted for self-localized light versus
walk-oﬀ angle. The results hold valid for generic self-focusing birefringent media and apply to large
angle steering of individual and multiple self-trapped optical beams.

An appealing approach towards the realization of dig-
ital multidimensional all-optical processors and informa-
tion routers is the use of spatially self-trapped optical
ﬁlaments -or solitons- as readdressable light pencils able
to guide signals in arbitrary directions. Although recent
years have witnessed widespread investigations of spa-
tial solitons in various nonlinear systems [1, 2], to date a
proper description and, hence, modeling and prediction
of such functionality is hampered by two main issues.
The ﬁrst is somewhat of a technical origin: while the most
studied nonlinearities for stable two-dimensional spatial
solitons rely on birefringent materials, [3] the eﬀects of
anisotropy have been accounted only for small walk-oﬀ or
propagation along one of the principal axes (e.g. in pho-
torefractives or quadratic media). [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] Dealing
with anisotropy in a perturbative way, current models fail
to predict the formation of self-collimated beams read-
dressable over wide-angles. The second issue relates to
the ubiquitous paraxial approximation, which is unable
to treat propagation at large angles with respect to the
input wavevector, i.e. to the launch direction ˆz of the
beam generating the soliton.

The above considerations hold valid also for spatial
modulational instability (MI), a process tipically accom-
panying (or precurring) solitons. MI describes unstable
plane-waves which, through self-focusing, break up into
transversely periodic patterns eventually evolving into ﬁl-
aments. [10] To date, the analysis of optical MI has been
limited to small birefringence and paraxial behavior even
in crystals with signiﬁcant anisotropy.

In this Letter we address nematic liquid crystals (NLC)
as a natural environment to assess the role of a strong
anisotropy in beam self-localization and MI. In doing so,
by letting the beam be paraxial not with respect to ˆz
but to a rotated reference system, we develop a model
which properly accounts for arbitrarily large walk-oﬀ and
birefringence. While this allows to deal with beam steer-
ing over large angles, [11] it also enlightens unexplored
features of solitons and MI for arbitrary crystal orien-

tations. The beam, polarized as an extraordinary wave,
gives up radial symmetry while acquiring an asymmet-
ric transverse proﬁle. The latter, depending on angle
of propagation, reveals a nontrivial distribution of both
longitudinal and transverse components. Moreover, dif-
fering anisotropic solitons or MI patterns can be expected
for a given walk-oﬀ.

The approach we introduce hereby is general and can
be applied to any anisotropic nonlinear medium. For il-
lustration sake and in order to pin-point a physically rel-
evant system, we explicitly refer to a voltage-biased glass
cell containing a thick layer of planarly-anchored nematic
liquid crystals. Such conﬁguration, encompassing a sig-
niﬁcant and externally-adjustable degree of birefringence
(and walk-oﬀ), has been previously exploited for various
experiments with spatial solitons (nematicons) and MI.
[10, 11, 12, 13] In the present context we adopt a refer-
ence system and notation as in Fig. 1. The starting point

Considering a light beam propagating in the midplane of
a much thicker cell, for NLC with director ˆn (e.g. mean
orientation of molecular major axes) in the (y, z) plane,
as in ﬁgure 1, the relative permittivity tensor is given by
εij = ε⊥δij + ∆εninj, and the anisotropy ∆ε constant in
the illuminated region. The ordinary (o-) wave is polar-
ized along x and n2
o = ε⊥, while the extraordinary (e-)
wave belongs to the (y, z) plane and the resulting index
is ne(θ0)2 = 2ε⊥(ε⊥ + ∆ε)/[2ε⊥ + ∆ε + ∆εcos(2θ0)]. The
unit-vector associated to the e-wave is denoted ˆt(θ0), and
its normal deﬁnes the walk-oﬀ direction ˆs(θ0). δ(θ0) is the

∆ε cos(θ0)2]. We omit hereafter the dependence on θ0.

The general plane-wave solution with wavevector par-
allel to z is a combination of e- and o-waves. In the fol-
lowing, we only consider the e-wave polarized along ˆt and
propagating along ˆs; the ordinary wave, being orthogonal
to ˆn, at the lowest order of approximation does not aﬀect
NLC molecular re-orientation through dipole-ﬁeld inter-
action, because of the existence of a threshold known as
the optical Freedericksz transition. [14, 15] Hence, for o-
waves of intensity well below the Freedericksz threshold,
the e-wave is the leading term in the NLC reorientational
nonlinear response.

The optical ﬁeld perturbs the dielectric tensor as ε

to 1 at the end of the derivation. The expansion is written

0, it
is Dx = Dt = 1 and isotropic propagation is retrieved.
Figure 2 plots these quantities versus θ0 for a highly-
birefringent NLC.[16] We need to stress that paraxiality
in the walk-oﬀ system does not imply paraxiality in the
original reference (x, y, z), as witnessed by the fact that,
when re-writing equation (4) in (x, y, z) the second-order
derivatives with respect to z re-appear. Since (4) holds
for any walk-oﬀ, this treatment can model wide angle
steering of spatial solitons, as e.g. obtainable by exploit-
ing the voltage dependence of δ in the NLC geometry.

The molecular director ˆn lies in the (y, z) plane and
can be expressed in terms of angle Θ = θ0 + Ψ (see ﬁg-
ure 1). Using a multiple scale expansion, for the e-wave
perturbation along ˆt at the lowest order in Ψ we have

The NLC orientation is described by the functional F =
FK + FRF + Fopt, with FK (Frank-term) accounting for
the elastic properties of the NLC and FRF for its director
distribution (and hence θ0) due to an externally applied
(electric or magnetic) ﬁeld in the absence of light. [15, 17]

Spatial solitons. Optical spatial solitons or nematicons
[12] are solutions of equations (4) and (7) in the form
Ee = (2Z0/ne)1/2U (x, t) exp(iβs), with U 2 the intensity
proﬁle and β the ”nonlinear wavevector,” and ∂sΨ = 0
(hereafter, we will always take ∂sΨ = 0 in (7), since
the optical ﬁeld is slowly varying along s, see also [18]).
Self trapped beams travel along ˆs, while their phase pro-
ﬁle is orthogonal to the plane k0nez + βs = [k0ne +
βcos(δ)]z
βsin(δ)y =constant, implying that for small
β (low-power solitons) the phasefront corresponds to a
plane wave propagating along z, gradually tilted towards
s as the power increases. In other words, the nonlinearity
tends to reshape the extraordinary wave into an ordinary-
like conﬁguration, by distorting the phase-fronts towards
the plane orthogonal to the Poynting vector. The exact
soliton proﬁles U can be obtained numerically. Neverthe-
less, relevant insights can be obtained in the highly non-
local limit,[19, 20] as applicable to NLC.[18] For NLC

as in actual experiments, in fact, the perturbation Ψ ex-
tends far from the excitation, so that the beam essentially
experiences an index perturbation with a parabolic-like
shape.[13] Writing ψ ∼= ψ0 + ψ2(x2 + t2), the equation for
U can be analytically solved by separation of variables,
yielding a wide class of self-trapped solutions including
higher-order and breathing ones. The simplest proﬁle is
gaussian with intensity proﬁle:

(highly nonlocal regime). The self-trapped beam travels
at any angle δ(θ0) with a gaussian proﬁle and ellipticity
Q = (Dt/Dx)1/4, as anticipated. As in the case of MI (see
below), two solitons (with diﬀerent κ) exist for the same
δ: their family is multivalued (one for each κ, spanned
by the power P ) with respect to walk-oﬀ δ (and unfolded
by θ0, i.e. propagating in diﬀerent planes), as visible in
ﬁgure 3. Noticeably, a straightforward generalization of
the theory in [21] (see also [22]) enables us to state that
such solitons (i.e. those of eqs. (4) and (7)) are uncondi-
tionally stable. Indeed, the Hamiltonian for the system
2dxdt + Hnl
∂tEe|
is written as H =
where Hnl the nonlinear nonlocal part which is identical
to the isotropic case, and bounded from below as shown
in [21]; the remaining part is also bounded because, from
Eq. (5), Dt and Dx are not smaller than ε⊥/(ε⊥ + ∆ε)
(see e.g. ﬁgure 2) and this implies the boundness of H,
and hence the stability.
One-dimensional modulational instability. A suﬃciently-
wide elliptic beam propagating along z in the nonlinear
sample approximates well a one-dimensional plane-wave.
Owing to reduced diﬀraction across the major axis of
the ellipse, in fact, the nonlinearity acts mainly in one-
dimension. As conﬁrmed by experiments, [10] MI causes

ﬁlaments. The instability can be intuitively described as
the (selective in transverse spatial frequency) ampliﬁca-
tion of small amplitude noise superimposed to the input
beam. For simplicity, we consider two limiting cases: an
input ellipse with long axis oriented i) along x (l = x)

wavevector kx,t will grow in amplitude along s with gain

being E0 the peak amplitude of the pump (input) ﬁeld.
Eq.(10) is the generalized expression of MI-gain in the
presence of both non-locality and anisotropy, and reduces
to the known result [10] in the isotropic regime. The MI-
gain is spectrally aﬀected by both the spatial orientation
of the input ellipse (with major axis parallel to either x
or t axes in cases i) and ii), respectively) and θ0. Fig-
ure 4 shows the calculated gain proﬁle for either orien-
tations Vs θ0 (i.e. by varying the cell bias) and typical
NLC parameters. Notably, the peak gain corresponds
to the maximum walk-oﬀ; when graphed Vs δ, however,
MI is multivalued:
for the same δ two distinct wave-
patterns can emerge, belonging to diﬀerent planes (t, z)
and corresponding to diﬀerent θ0. In an advanced stage
of MI-induced ﬁlamentation, this implies the possibility
of angularly steering an entire array of regularly spaced
(soliton) channel waveguides by acting on θ0.

In conclusion, by developing a comprehensive model
for nonlinear wave propagation in the presence of signiﬁ-
cant walk-oﬀ, we predict the existence of (multi-value)

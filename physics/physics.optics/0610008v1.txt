The extra energy, negative energy and annihilation of energy by the subwavelength conservative
systems that have a wave nature of light or matter (quantum) objects are predicted. The creating
and destroying of energy break the energy conservation law in any subwavelength physical system.
The paradoxical phenomenon is demonstrated in the context of extraordinary transmission of light
and matter through subwavelength apertures [T.W. Ebbesen et al., Nature (London) 391, 667
(1998)) and E. Moreno et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 170406 (2005)].

The energy conservation law is the most important
of conservation laws in physics. Conservation of energy
states that the total amount of energy in a isolated sys-
tem remains constant.
In other words, energy can be
converted from one form to another, but it cannot be
created or destroyed. The energy conservation law is a
mathematical consequence of the shift symmetry of time;
energy conservation is implied by the empirical fact that
physical laws remain the same over time. The energy
conservation aﬀects all physical phenomena without ex-
ceptions, for an example, the recently discovered extraor-
dinary (enhanced) transmission of light through subwave-
length apertures in a metal screen [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
The transmission enhancement is a process that can in-
clude the resonant excitation of surface plasmons [2, 3, 4],
Fabry-Perot-like intraslit modes [5, 6, 7], and evanescent
electromagnetic waves at the metal surface [8].
In the
case of thin screens whose thickness are too small to sup-
port the intraslit resonance, the extraordinary transmis-
sion of light or matter (electrons) is caused by the reso-
nant excitation of surface waves [2, 3, 4, 9]. At the reso-
nant conditions, the system redistributes the electromag-
netic energy around the screen, such that more energy is
eﬀectively transmitted compared to the energy imping-
ing on the slit opening. The total energy of the system is
conserved under the energy redistribution. In the present
paper, we predict the extra energy, negative energy and
annihilation of energy by an ensemble of light or matter
beams produced by an array of subwavelength apertures.
The creating and destroying of energy break the energy
conservation law in any subwavelength physical system.
That leads, in particular, to the extraordinary transmis-
sion without assistance of the surface waves.

Let us ﬁrst investigate the transmission of

light
through a subwavelength structure, namely an array of
parallel subwavelength slits. The array of M indepen-
dent slits of width 2a and period Λ in a metallic screen
of thickness b ≪ λ is considered. The metal is assumed
to be a perfect conductor. The screen placed in vacuum
is illuminated by a normally incident TM-polarized wave
with wavelength λ = 2πc/ω = 2π/k. The magnetic ﬁeld

of the wave ~H(x, y, z, t) = U (x)exp(−i(kz + ωt))~ey is
assumed to be time harmonic and constant in the y di-
rection. The energy balance, which determines the trans-
mission coeﬃcient of the slit array, is derived by calcu-
lating the power of light beams in the far-ﬁeld diﬀraction
zone. The EM beams produced by each of the inde-
pendent slits are computed by using the Neerhoﬀ and
Mur approach, which uses a Green’s function formalism
for rigorous numerical solution of Maxwell’s equations
for a single, isolated slit [10, 11]. The transmission of
the slit array is determined by calculating all the light
power P (λ) radiated into the far-ﬁeld diﬀraction zone,
x∈[−∞, ∞] at the distance z ≫ λ from the screen. The
total per-slit transmission coeﬃcient, which represents
the per-slit enhancement in transmission achieved by tak-
ing a single, isolated slit and placing it in an M -slit array,
is then found by using an equation TM (λ) = P (λ)/M P1.
Here, P is the total power of M beams produced by the
array, and P1 is the power of a beam produced by the
single slit. Figure 1 shows the transmission coeﬃcient
TM (λ), in the spectral region 500-2000 nm, calculated for
the array parameters: a = 100 nm, Λ = 1800 nm, and
b = 5 × 10−3λmax. The transmitted power was computed
by integrating the total energy ﬂux at the distance z = 1
mm over the detector region of width ∆x = 20 mm. The
transmission spectra TM (λ) is shown for diﬀerent values
of M . We notice that the spectra TM (λ) is periodically
modulated, as a function of wavelength, below and above
a level deﬁned by the transmission T1(λ) = 1 of one iso-
lated slit. As M is increased from 2 to 10, the visibility of
the modulation fringes increases approximately from 0.2
to 0.7. The transmission TM exhibits the Fabry-Perot
like maxima around wavelengths λn = Λ/n (n=1, 2, ...).
The spectral peaks increase with increasing the number
of slits and reach a saturation (T max
M ≈ 5) in amplitude
by M = 300, at λ ≈ 1800 nm. The peak widths and the
spectral shifts of the resonances from the Fabry-Perot
wavelengths decrease with increasing the number M of
slits. Figure 1 indicates that enhancement and suppres-
sion in the transmission spectra are the natural proper-
ties of an ensemble of independent subwavelength slits in

resonances at the wavelengths λn≈Λ/n, n=1, 2 and 3.

a thin (b ≪ λ) screen. The spectral peaks are character-
ized by asymmetric Fano-like proﬁles. Such modulations
in the transmission spectra are known as Wood’s anoma-
lies. The minima and maxima correspond to Rayleigh
anomalies and Fano resonances, respectively. The Wood
anomalies in transmission spectra of optical gratings, a
long standing problem in optics [12], follows naturally
from interference properties of our model. Another pre-
diction is a weak Wood’s anomaly in a classical Young
type two-slit system (M = 2). Figure 1 shows the extra
energy (T > 1), negative energy (T < 1) and annihila-
tion of energy (T < 1). The creating and destroying of
energy break the energy conservation law in the system
of M independent subwavelength beams (slits).

To clarify the results of the computer code we have
developed an analytical model, which yields simple for-
mulas for the diﬀracted ﬁelds. For the ﬁelds diﬀracted
by a narrow (2a ≪ λ, b ≥ 0) slit into the region |z| > 2a,
it can be shown that the Neerhoﬀ and Mur model simpli-
ﬁes to an analytical one. For the magnetic ~H = (0, Hy, 0)
and electric ~E = (Ex, 0, Ez) ﬁelds we found:

functions, respectively. The ﬁelds are spatially nonuni-
form, in contrast to a common opinion that a subwave-
length aperture diﬀracts light in all directions uniformly
[13]. The ﬁelds produced by an array of M indepen-
M
dent slits are given by ~E(x, z) = P

~Hm(x + mΛ, z), where ~Em and ~Hm
and ~H(x, z) = P

are the ﬁelds of an m-th beam generated by the respec-
tive slit. As an example, Fig. 2(a) compares the far-
ﬁeld distributions calculated by the analytical formulas
(1-5) to that obtained in the rigorous model. We notice
that the distributions are indistinguishable. The ﬁeld
power P , which determines the ﬁeld energy, is found by
integrating the energy ﬂux |~S| = | ~E × ~H ∗ + ~E∗ × ~H|.
Thus, the analytical model describes accurately also the
energy balance in the system of M independent sub-
wavelength beams. The model does not only support
results of our computer code, but presents an intuitively
transparent explanation (physical mechanism) of the ex-
tra energy, negative energy, and annihilation of energy in
terms of the constructive or destructive interference of
the M independent subwavelength beams produced by
the multi-beam source. The creating and destroying of
energy break the energy conservation law and cause the
extraordinary transmission without assistance of the sur-
face waves. Notice that the array-induced decrease of the
central beam divergence (Figs. 2(b) and 2(c)) is relevant
to the beaming light [14], and the diﬀraction-less light
and matter beams [15]. The amplitudes of the beams
(evanescent ﬁelds) can rapidly decrease with increasing
the distances x and z. However, due to the enhancement

and beaming mechanisms (Figs. 1-4), the array produces
a propagating wave with low divergence. Such a behav-
ior is in agreement with the Huygens-Fresnel principle,
which considers a propagating wave as a superposition of
secondary spherical waves.

It is now important to understand the energy bal-
ance in the two fundamental systems of wave optics, the
single-slit and two-slit systems. The major features of
the transmission through a single subwavelength slit are
the intraslit resonances and the spectral shifts of the res-
onances from the Fabry-Perot wavelengths [5]. In agree-
ment with the predictions [5], the formula (4) shows that
the transmission T = P/P0 = (a/k)[Re(D)]2 + [Im(D)]2
exhibits Fabry-Perot like maxima around wavelengths
λn = 2b/n, where P0 is the power impinging on the
slit opening. The enhancement and spectral shifts are
explained by the wavelength dependent terms in the de-
nominator of Eq. (4). The enhancement (T (λ1)≈b/πa
[15]) is in contrast to the attenuation predicted by the
model [5]. At the resonant conditions, the system re-
distributes the electromagnetic energy in the intra-slit
region and around the screen, such that more energy
(T > 1) is eﬀectively transmitted compared to the en-
ergy impinging on the slit opening. The total energy of
the system is conserved under the energy redistribution.
This mechanism is diﬀerent from those based on the cre-
ating and destroying of energy by the multi-beam (multi-
slit) system. The Young type two-slit conﬁguration is
characterized by a sinusoidal modulation of the trans-
mission spectra T2(λ) [16, 17]. The modulation period is
inversely proportional to the slit separation Λ. The visi-
bility V of the fringes is of order 0.2, independently on the
slit separation. In our model, the transmission is given by
T2∼R [F 1
0 (x2)]dx, where x1 =
x and x2 = x + Λ. The high-frequency modulations with
the sideband-frequency fs(Λ) ≈f1(λ) + f2(Λ, λ)∼1/Λ
(Figs. 1 and 3) are produced like that in a classic hetero-
dyne system by mixing two waves having diﬀerent spatial
frequencies, f1 and f2. Although our model ignores the
plasmons, its prediction for the visibility (V ≈ 0.1) of the
fringes and the resonant wavelengths λn = Λ/n compare
well with the plasmon-assisted Young’s type experiment
[16] (Fig. 3). In the case of b ≥ λ/2, the resonances at

two enhancement regimes at Λ ≪ λ and Λ≥λ.

λn = Λ/n can be accompanied by the intraslit resonances
at λn = 2b/n. One can easily demonstrate such behav-
ior by using the analytical formulas (1-5). Notice that
although our model considers a screen of perfect con-
ductivity, polarization charges develop on the metal sur-
face [18]. The proponents of surface polaritons, however,
do not adhere strictly to traditional surface plasmons.
We considered TM-polarized waves because TE modes
are cut oﬀ by a thick slit. In the case of a thin screen, TE
modes propagate into slits so that magneto-polaritons
develop. Because of the symmetry of Maxwell’s equa-
tions the scattering intensity is formally identical with ~E
and ~H swapping roles. Again, no traditional plasmons
are present. The surface waves can couple the radiation
phases of the slits, so that they get synchronized, and
a collective emission can release the stored energy as an
enhanced radiation. This kind of enhancement is of dif-
ferent nature compared to our model, because the model
does not require coupling between the slits (beams).

In order to gain physical insight into the energy bal-
ance in the multi-beam (M ≥2) subwavelength systems,
we now consider the dependence of the transmission
TM (λ) on the slit separation Λ. We assume that the slits
(beams) are independent also at Λ → 0. According to
the Van Citter-Zernike coherence theorem, a light source
(even incoherent) of radius r = M (a + Λ) produces a
transversally coherent wave at the distance z≥πRr/λ in
the region of radius R. Thus, in the case of a subwave-
length light source (Λ ≪ λ), the collective emission of
the ensemble of slits generates the coherent electric and
~Emexp(iϕm)≈M ~E1exp(iϕ)
magnetic ﬁelds, ~E = P
and ~H≈M ~H1exp(iϕ). This means that the beams ar-
rive at the detector with the same phases ϕm(x) ≈ ϕ(x).
Consequently, the power (energy) of the emitted light

M
m=1

scales with the square of the number of slits (beams),
P ∼ M 2. Therefore, the transmission (TM ∼P/M ) grows
linearly with the number of slits, TM ∼M . For a given M ,
the function TM (λ) monotonically varies with λ. Such a
regime (the ﬁrst regime) can be observed in Fig. 4. At
the appropriate conditions, the transmission can reach
the 1000-times enhancement (M = λz/πR(a + Λ)). The
enhancement in the second regime does not require close
proximity of the slits. In the case of R ≥ λz/πr (Λ≥λ),
the beams arrive at the detector with diﬀerent phases
ϕm(x). Consequently, the power and transmission grow
more slow with the number of slits (beams) (Figs. 1-4).
Notice, that according to the energy conservation law
one should expect that the transmission (energy) would
remain constant with changing the beam separation.

The constructive or destructive interference of the
beams, which leads to the creating and destroying of
energy, are provided by the well-deﬁned phase relation-
ships (ϕm(x) = ϕ(x) or ϕm(x) − ϕm+1(x) = π) between
the subwavelength beams at the diﬀerent lateral loca-
tions in the far ﬁeld. Such phase conditions can be sat-
isﬁed also by spherical waves generated by the point-like
sources separated by the distance δx ≪ λ [19]. Thus, the
above-described phenomena depends neither on the na-
ture (light or matter) of the subwavelength beams (con-
tinuous beams or pulses) nor on material and shape of
the apertures (1-D and 2-D apertures or ﬁbers). Due to
Babinet’s principle, the phenomena should be observed
also in the reﬂection spectra. Notice that the inter-
ference of the positive (+ψ = ψ exp(iϕ)) and negative
(−ψ = ψ exp(iϕ + π)) matter ﬁelds produces a ﬁeld with
zero amplitude and energy. The value T =0 is obtained
by summing the respective positive and negative energies.
Although, the phenomenon is paradoxical it does not con-
tradict to the general relation for ﬁelds, ψ + (−1)ψ = 0
and W (ψ = 0) = 0. The negative energy can be extracted
from the total positive energy of the system. Therefore,
the destroyed ﬁeld and energy cannot be attributed to
the vacuum ﬁeld of the quantum ﬁeld theory.

It is worth noting that our consideration of the light
transmission is similar in spirit to the dynamical diﬀrac-
tion models [20, 21], the Airy-like model [22], and espe-
cially to a surface evanescent wave model [8]. There is an
evident resemblance also between our model and a Dicke
superradiance quantum model [23] of emission of an en-
semble of atoms. A quantum reformulation of our model,
which will be presented in our next paper, can help us to
understand why a quantum entangled state of photons is
preserved on passage through a hole array [24].

It should be stressed that energy in macroscopic sys-
tems (waves) may neither be created nor destroyed (no-
body has yet observed the phenomenon); the sum of all
the energies in the system is a constant. For an exam-
ple, the energy of two macroscopic harmonic light beams
A and B, which propagate in the same direction and

4

have the same amplitudes (EA = EB = E0) and en-
ergies (WA=WB=W0=E0E∗
0 R dx), is given by WAB =
WA+WB+2E0E∗
0 R cos(ϕA(x) − ϕB(x))dx, where ϕA(x)
and ϕB(x) are the wave phases at the coordinate x,
and ∆t = 1. The interference term, which is the ad-
ditional energy from a point of view of the energy con-
servation (WAB = WA + WB), is the positive or negative
energy associated with the wave phases. In the case of
ϕA(x) = ϕB(x), the energy is WAB = W0 + W0 + 2W0,
where 2W0 is the extra energy. The annihilation of en-
ergy (WAB = W0 + W0 + (−2W0)) is achieved in the
case of ϕA(x) − ϕB(x) = π. One can easily demonstrate
that the macroscopic waves with such phases can be re-
alized only for the short time limited by ∆W ∆t∼h. We
have predicted the extra energy, negative energy and an-
nihilation of energy by an ensemble of light or matter
subwavelength beams (slits) for ∆t = ∞. The creating
and destroying of energy break the energy conservation
law in any subwavelength physical system. That leads,
in particular, to the extraordinary transmission without
assistance of the surface waves.

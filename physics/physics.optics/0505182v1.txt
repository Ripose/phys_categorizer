Comment on the use of the method of images for calculating electromagnetic
responses of interacting spheres

Vadim A. Markel
Departments of Radiology and Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104
(Dated: August 11, 2013)

In this Comment I argue that the method of images used by Huang, Yu, Gu and co-authors [Phys
Rev. E, 65, 21401 (2002); Phys Rev. E., 69, 51402 (2004)] to calculate electromagnetic properties of
interacting spheres at ﬁnite frequencies is inapplicable and does not provide a physically meaningful
approximation.

Recently, Huang, Yu, Gu and co-authors (referred to
as HYG below) have applied the method of images to
study theoretically the electromagnetic properties of two
interacting spherical particles [1, 2]. As is well known,
the method of images can be applied to spherical con-
ductors in the electrostatic limit, i.e., when the dielectric
constant ǫ can be formally set to i∞ and the Bergman-
Milton spectral parameter s = 1/(ǫ − 1) is equal to zero.
At ﬁnite frequencies, when s is not small compared to the
generalized depolarization factors sn, the method of im-
ages is not applicable. However, HYG apply the method
to dielectric particles at arbitrary frequencies, assuming
only that the size of the two-sphere dimer is much smaller
than the external wavelength. In particular, they claim
to be able to extract the factors sn and the correspond-
ing oscillator strengths Fn, which characterize the elec-
tromagnetic response of a system within the quasistatics.
In the ﬁrst paper of the series [3] and in Ref. [1] the au-
thors mention that their method is approximate. How-
ever, in the more recent paper [2] it is presented as exact
and used without restriction. In the present Comment
I show that it is impossible to calculate the quantities
sn and Fn using the method of images. Moreover, the
expressions for sn and Fn given by HYG are not con-
sistent with the exact electrostatic solution. Thus, the
mathematical formalism developed by HYG is not only
not exact, but does not provide a physically meaningful
and controllable approximation.

We start with a brief review of mathematical formal-
ism used by HYG. Within the quasistatics, dipole mo-
ment of an arbitrary particle characterized by the dielec-
tric function ǫ(ω) and excited by a homogeneous external
ﬁeld E0 exp(−iωt) can be written as d exp(−iωt) where
d = ˆαE0. Here ˆα is the polarizability tensor. If polariza-
tion of the external ﬁeld coincides with one of the prin-
cipal axes of ˆα, both vectors d and E0 become collinear.
The corresponding scalar polarizability can be written in
the Bergman-Milton spectral representation [4] as

α =

v
4π

where v is the volume of the particle, sn - the generalized
depolarization factors satisfying 0 < sn < 1 and Fn are
the corresponding oscillator strengths.

In the case of two spheres, one principal axis of the

polarizability tensor coincides with the axis of symmetry,
and the other two axes are perpendicular to the ﬁrst one
and to each other, but otherwise arbitrary. HYG consider
two interacting spheres of the radius R each separated by
the center-to-center distance 2L, obtain the diagonal ele-
ments of the polarizability tensor and derive the following
expressions for Fn and sn:

n = F (T )

where the upper index (L) denotes longitudinal modes,
(T ) denotes transverse modes, and a is the solution
to cosh a = L/R, or, explicitly, a = ln[L/R +
(L/R)2 − 1] [5]. It can be veriﬁed that Fn satisfy the

sum rule
p

n Fn = 1.

Everywhere below we consider only the longitudinal
modes, although the results of HYG for the transverse
modes are also incorrect. The longitudinal modes are
more important physically, since they are known to
produce extremely high ﬁeld enhancements in axially-
symmetrical arrays of nanospheres [6] and have been ex-
tensively studied in conjunction with the single-molecule
spectroscopy [7].

First, let us discuss the small-frequency limit for con-
ductors. In this limit, the dielectric function can be writ-
ten as ǫ = 4πiσ/ω, where σ is the static conductivity.
Correspondingly, s ∝ ω → 0, and we can expand α into
a power series in s. The expansion can be obtained from
(1) and reads

The electrostatic polarizability is given by αes =
(v/4π)A0. The method of images can provide an exact

expression for αes and, correspondingly, for A0. How-
ever, since there is an inﬁnite number of diﬀerent sets of
Fn, sn that produce the same value of A0, it is impossible
to ﬁnd these coeﬃcients from the electrostatic solution.
We emphasize that this is not possible even if one con-
siders the inter-sphere separation as an additional degree
of freedom, since all quantities (Ak, Fn and sn) depend
parametrically on L/R. Instead, if the summation in the
right-hand side of (6) is truncated at n = N , one needs
to calculate all coeﬃcients Ak from k = 0 to k = 2N − 1
in order to make the system of equations (6) suﬃciently
determined. But the electrostatic solution based on the
method of images can provide only one of these coeﬃ-
cients, namely, A0.

Fig. 1. A0(L/R) − A0(∞) as a function of the relative

separation L/R calculated by diﬀerent methods.

Although one can not expect that the set of Fn, sn
given by HYG (2),(3) would produce, upon substitu-
tion into (6), the correct expansion coeﬃcients Ak for
k > 0,
it is still possible that the value of A0 ob-
tained in this manner is correct. However, as is demon-
strated in Fig. 1, this is not so. In this ﬁgure, we plot
the function A0(L/R) − A0(∞) (for conducting spheres,
A0(∞) = 3) calculated by diﬀerent methods. The math-
ematically rigorous result is shown by the solid curve,
and the result of HYG by the long dash. We also show
in this ﬁgure two analytical asymptotes valid for L >> R
(shorter dash) and L → R (dots). The diﬀerent curves
in Fig. 1 are explained below in more detail. At this
point, we note that the result of HYG for A0(L/R) is ac-
curate at large separations (L ≫ R), but breaks down
when L/R ≈ 1.2, and becomes grossly inaccurate at
L/R ≈ 1.03.
In particular, the HYG curve has a sin-
gularity at L/R = xc ≡ (22/3 + 1)/24/3 ≈ 1.026. This
is due to the fact that the ﬁrst depolarization factor s1
deﬁned by (3) crosses zero when L/R = xc. The appear-
ance of negative depolarization factors for smaller inter-
sphere separations is unphysical and can, in particular,
result in divergence of the electrostatic polarizability [8].
In the next two paragraphs I explain how the data
for diﬀerent curves shown in Fig. 1 were calculated. The
solid curve was obtained by diagonalization of the electro-
magnetic interaction operator W whose matrix elements
are given [9] by

where i, i′ = 1, 2 label the spheres, l, l′ = 1, 2, . . . and zi
is the z coordinate of the center of ith sphere, assuming
the z-axis coincides with the axis of symmetry. The de-
polarization factors sn are the eigenvalues of W while the
oscillator strengths can be found as squared projections
of the corresponding eigenvectors |ni on the vector of ex-
ternal ﬁeld: Fn = hE|nihn|Ei, where |Ei is normalized
so that hE|Ei = 1 [8]. The matrix deﬁned in (7) was
truncated so that l, l′ ≤ lmax = 1000 and diagonalized
numerically.
In the absence of round-oﬀ errors and in
the limit lmax → ∞, such diagonalization would produce
the inﬁnite set of exact values sn, Fn. We note that at
lmax = 1000 and L/R ≥ 1.01, all the modes whose oscil-
lator strength are not very small (i.e., greater than 0.001)
have converged with a very high precision, and that the
round-oﬀ errors do not inﬂuence the results in any no-
ticeable way since the matrix W is well-conditioned.

The dots and short dash in Fig. 1 show the theo-
retical asymptotes obtained by Mazets who has derived
an expression for A0 in terms of hypergeometrical func-
tions [10]. He has also provided simple asymptotic ex-
pansions which are valid for small and large inter-sphere
separations. Thus, for longitudinal excitations,

where ζ(x) is the Riemann zeta-function and C is the
Euler constant. The second term in the right-hand side
of (9) is a correction due to the dipole-dipole interaction
while the third term describe the next non-vanishing in-
put due to the higher multipole interaction.
It can be
veriﬁed that the asymptotic expansion of the HYG re-
sult coincides with (9) at least up to the sixth order in
L/R. However, the small-separation asymptote (8) is
dramatically diﬀerent from the one that follows from the
HYG formulas.

Fig.2 Bergman-Milton depolarization factors, sn, and the
corresponding oscillator strengths, Fn, for diﬀerent relative
inter-sphere separations L/R. Dashed lines are plotted to
guide the eye.

Fig. 3. Dimensionless extinction parameter ε = σe/kv as a
function of wavelength λ, where σe is the extinction cross sec-
tion, k = 2π/λ, v is the total volume of the scatterer, plotted
for diﬀerent relative inter-sphere separations L/R. Polar-
ization of the incident ﬁeld is parallel to the axis of symmetry.

Next, we compare the coeﬃcients sn, Fn deﬁned by
(2),(3) according to HYG with respective values obtained
by direct diagonalization of the interaction matrix W .
The results are shown in Fig. 2. A signiﬁcant discrepancy
already exists at L/R = 1.2 and becomes more dramatic
as this ratio approaches unity. Negative depolarization
factors are present in the plot for L/R = 1.01. We note
that the smallest inter-sphere separation considered by
HYG was L/R = 1 + 1/30 ≈ 1.033. As was mentioned

above, the negative depolarization factors appear for
L/R ≤ xc ≈ 1.026. At these separations, results of any
calculation based on the HYG formalism are expected to
be grossly inaccurate and unphysical. However, this fact
is not explained in Refs. [1, 2]. For example, the choice
of values for L/R in Fig. 5 of Ref. [1] appears to be ran-
dom, while, in fact, all these values satisfy the critical
condition L/R > xc.

While it is demonstrated in Fig. 2 that the values of

4

P

sn, Fn calculated according to HYG are inaccurate, these
coeﬃcients are not directly measurable in an experiment.
However, they can be used to calculate various physically
measurable quantities. For example, the extinction cross
n Fn/(s+sn). In Fig. 3
section is given by σe = 4πkvIm
we plot the extinction spectra of two silver nanoparticles
obtained for the same inter-sphere separations as in Fig. 2
and for the longitudinal polarization of the external ﬁeld.
Interpolated data for silver from Ref. [11] have been used
to calculate the spectral parameter s as a function of
wavelength. It can be seen that the spectra calculated
using the formulas (2),(3) for sn, Fn diﬀer dramatically
from those calculated with the use of exact values of these
coeﬃcients. The discrepancy is evident even at relatively
large separation, L/R = 1.2. It should be noted that in
the case L/R = 1.01 the HYG spectra exhibit unlimited
growth with the wavelength which starts in the near-IR
region (data not shown). This is due to the appearance of
negative depolarization factors and contradicts the gen-
eral sum rules for extinction spectra which imply that σe
must decrease faster than 1/λ in the limit λ → ∞ [8].
Note that the presence of negative depolarization factors
can result in even more severe anomalies of extinction
spectra in dielectrics whose static dielectric permeability
is positive, as well as the value of s in the limit λ → ∞.
The papers [1, 2] contain a number of other less sig-
niﬁcant inaccuracies.
In particular, HYG confuse ori-
entational averaging (for randomly-oriented bispheres)
with the averaging over polarization of the incident light.
Thus, for example, Eq. 2 in Ref. [1] is presented as a re-
sult of averaging over polarization for a ﬁxed bisphere.

However, such averaging should clearly depend on the di-
rection of the incident wave vector relatively to the axis
In fact, the ﬁrst equal-
of symmetry of the bisphere.
ity in this formula gives the result of orientational av-
eraging, except that HYG are mistaken in stating that
hcos2 θi = hsin2 θi = 1/2.
It is easy to check that
hcos2 θi = 1/3 and hsin2 θi = 2/3. Note that the second
equality in Eq. 2 of Ref. [1] would be correct if the aver-
aging is done over polarizations of the incident beam for
a ﬁxed bisphere, assuming that the incident wave vector
is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry.

It should be noted that on page 4 of Ref. [1], the au-
thors acknowledge that the method of images is only ap-
proximate but state that the approximation is very good
and make a reference to the earlier work [3] to support
that statement. However, in Ref. [3] veriﬁcation of the
accuracy of the method of images is only done for rela-
tively large separations, namely L/R ≥ 1.5 (Figs. 3, 4
in Ref. [3]). At these separations, the multipole eﬀects
are generally not important, which clearly follows from
the data shown in these ﬁgures. However, in later pub-
lications, HYG have used the method for much smaller
separations, typically, L/R = 1 + 1/30.

Finally, on the same page of Ref. [1], the authors write:
“More accurate calculations based on bispherical coordi-
nates can be attempted.” This was, in fact, done in the
above-referenced paper by Mazets [10], although only for
perfect conductors. More general analytical results can
be obtained with the use of the theory of hypercom-
plex variables (a generalization of the conformal map-
ping) [12].

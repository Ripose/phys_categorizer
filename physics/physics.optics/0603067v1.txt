Using an extended plane-wave-based transfer-matrix method, the photonic band structures and
the corresponding transmission spectrum of a two-dimensional left-handed photonic crystal are
calculated. Comparisons between the periodic structure with a single left-handed cylindric rod are
made, and many interesting similarities are found. It is shown that, due to the localized surface
polaritons presented by an isolated left-handed rod, there exist many exciting physical phenomena
in high-dimensional left-handed photonic crystals. As direct results of coupling of the localized
surface polaritons of neighboring left-handed rod, a lot of almost dispersionless bands, anti-crossing
behavior, and a zero ¯n gap are exhibited in the left-handed periodic structure. Moreover, in a
certain frequency region, except distorted by a lot of anti-crossing behavior, there exists a continual
dispersion relation, which can be explained by the long-wavelength approximation. It is also pointed
out that high-dimensional left-handed photonic crystals can be used to design narrow-band ﬁlter.

Starting from the pioneering papers of Yablonovich [1] and John [2] in 1987, the past decade has witnessed a great
deal of interest in photonic crystals (PCs), also named as photonic band gap (PBG) materials. These have dielectric
constituents which are periodically arranged in space, either in one, two, or three dimensions, with important potential
applications in the optical, microwave and infrared ﬁelds [3]. One of their important properties is to mould and control
the ﬂow and distribution of the light at its most microscopic level. The synergetic interplay in these PCs between the
microcavity resonances of composite particles and the Bragg scattering resonances of the dielectric arrays lead to the
formation of a PBG, i.e., a range of frequencies for which no propagating electromagnetic (EM) modes are allowed.
Due to the presence of the PBG in the dispersion relation of the EM ﬁeld, the photonic density of states in PCs is
suppressed over a certain frequency window. These features open the possibility for many important technological
applications including lossless PC waveguides, low-threshold PC lasers, and high-Q PC nanocavities [3].

Most of the early research eﬀorts were concentrated on PBG materials consisting of positive and frequency-
independent dielectrics. In the past few years, due to the new developments in structured EM materials, left-handed
(LH) meta-materials have been fabricated [4, 5]. This new kind of meta-materials were ﬁrst speculated by Veselago
in 1967, which characterized by simultaneous negative dielectric permittivity and negative magnetic permeability and
therefore a negative refractive index in some frequency ranges [6]. Many anomalous eﬀects can exist in such meta-
materials, such as a reversed Doppler shift, reversed Cerenkov radiation, negative radiation pressure, and inverse
Snell-Descarteds law. One of the most exciting applications of LH meta-materials is the possibility of a perfect lens
whose image resolution is not subject to the limitations of the traditional diﬀraction limit of a wavelength [7, 8].

Recently, a periodic arrangement of LH meta-materials, namely LH photonic crystals, have become the object of
intense experimental and theoretical interest [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Like polaritonic PCs whose µ is homogeneous while ǫ
is frequency-dependent [13], the substitution of LH meta-materials into PCs is expected to introduce a whole range
of exciting physical phenomena. For instance, a multilayer structure with stacking alternating layers of ordinary
(positive-n) and negative-n materials can result in an omnidirectional zero-¯n gap [9], where the defect modes are
weakly dependent on the incident angles [14]. In general, the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability in LH
meta-materials are frequency-dependent [8]. In a split ring resonator used to create negative magnetic materials, the
magnetic permeability is normally expressed as µ(ω) = 1 − ω2
m/ω(ω + iγ), where ωm is the eﬀective magnetic plasma
frequency, ω is the frequency of the light and γ represents the light absorption [8]. Due to the dispersive properties of
LH meta-materials, it brings a lot of diﬃculties to simulate high-dimensional LH PCs with the conventional method,
such as plane-wave expansion method [3] and ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain method [15].

Here, using an extended plane-wave-based transfer-matrix method, whose details are presented in the appendix, the
optical properties of high-dimensional LH PCs are studied. The fundamental physical background of our method is:
(1) Divide the whole PC structure into thin slices along the z-axis direction, within each slice ǫ and µ are approximated
as z-independent (they can be xy-dependent); (2) It is assumed that each slice is surrounded by two thin air ﬁlms
with zero thickness; (3) Expression of the EM ﬁeld in the air ﬁlms by Bragg waves; (4) Expression of the EM ﬁeld in
each slice by the eigenmodes in the slice; (5) Use of the boundary conditions between EM ﬁelds in the slice and two
neighboring air ﬁlms to obtain the transfer matrix or the scattering matrix; (6) Use of the obtained matrix to calculate
the transmission spectrum of the PC. The photonic band structure of the PC can thus be obtained by using Bloch’s
theorem. Since the independent variable in these calculations is frequency rather than wave vector, it can therefore

eﬀectively simulate LH PCs, even their magnetic permeability and dielectric permittivity are all frequency-dependent
and negative.

Based on this approach, the photonic band structures and the corresponding spectrum of two-dimensional (2D) LH
PCs are calculated. The 2D PC considered here is a square lattice of LH cylindric rods embedded in air background.
For the sake of easy comparison, the electric permittivity ǫ(ω) and the magnetic permeability µ(ω) of the rods are
adopted from Ref.[16]. The free electron expression of ǫ(ω) is assumed,

where ωp is the frequency of bulk longitudinal electron excitations, and

ǫ(ω) = 1 −

.

The parameters assumed are: F = 0.4, ωp = 0.552(2πc/a), ω0 = 0.276(2πc/a), and the radius of the rod r = 0.3a,
where a is the lattice constant, c is the speed of light in vacuum. Note that the parameters ω0 and ωp used here are
1/20 of that used in Ref.[16].

In Fig. (1) we plot the dependence on frequency ωa/2πc of the parameters of the LH cylindric rods: µ(ω), ǫ(ω),
|n(ω)|. It is clearly shown that: for frequency ω < ω0, ǫ(ω) < 0 and µ(ω) > 0, which means in this frequency region
the meta-material is single-negative; for ω0 < ω < 0.35635(2πc/a), both µ(ω) and ǫ(ω) are negative, that is, the
meta-material is left-handed; for 0.35635(2πc/a) < ω < ωp, ǫ(ω) < 0 and µ(ω) > 0, which means the meta-material
is single-negative again; for ω > ωp, both µ(ω) and ǫ(ω) are positive, and the meta-material is right-handed. Notice
that 0.35635 is also 1/20 of the ωb used in Ref.[16].

The photonic band structures for the transverse magnetic (TM) mode along the Γ − X direction are calculated and
shown in Fig. (2), and the corresponding transmission spectrum along the same direction for a 16-layer structure are
also calculated and shown in Fig. (3a). Here, in frequency region ω < ω0 and ω > 0.35635(2πc/a) where the meta-
materials are not LH, 101 plane waves are used, the cylindric rods are divided equally into 20 parts, and the increment
frequency is 1.0 × 10−5(2πc/a); while, for the left-handed region, that is, ω0 < ω < 0.35635(2πc/a), 161 plane waves
are used, the cylindric rods are divided equally into 50 parts, and the increment frequency is 1.0 × 10−6(2πc/a). It can
be expected that, by decreasing the increment frequency, which leads to more computational burden, more accurate
results will be obtained.

[0.25(2πc/a), 0.37(2πc/a)]. (3)The frequency range is [0.327(2πc/a), 0.357(2πc/a)].

Comparing with the scattering resonances of a single LH cylindric rod shown in Fig.(2b) in Ref.[16], there are two
signiﬁcant similarities between our periodic structure and the single rod :(1) Many anti-crossing behavior exist and
only exist in the band structures where the meta-materials are left-handed, which lead to the formation of very narrow
band gaps and the appearance of sharp resonant peaks in the transmission spectrum. Similar results were obtained
from the scattering resonances of the single LH rod [16], where resonances only exist in the frequency region where
the cylindric rod is LH. The physical mechanism of the anti-crossing behavior in our periodic structure is same to
that of the scattering resonances of the single rod, that is, the appearance of inﬁnite surface polaritons [16, 17]; (2)
A narrow band gap exists around 0.6(2πc/a), corresponding to the valley in the transmission spectrum. Notice that
similar dip was also founded around the same place in the scattering resonances of the single rod [16]. It is a direct
result of the fact that the eﬀective refractive index of the periodic structure around 0.6(2πc/a), which is roughly given
by

is only 0.8. This value is very close to the refractive index of vacuum, therefore, the transmission rates around this
narrow band gap is not zero, but still about 37%, as shown in Fig.(3a). Based on these two similarities, we can
conclude that for a high-dimensional LH PC, just like a polaritonic PC, the band structure is governed primarily by
the surface polaritons of a single rod, whose frequencies are determined by the rod’s geometry, where the periodicity
of the crystal will only introduce slight dispersion [13].

In addition, four more signiﬁcant features can be found from the band structures of our periodic structure: (1)
A wide band gap, from 0 to 0.2545(2πc/a), is shown in Fig.(2) and Fig.(3a), which is mainly due to the single-
negative property of the meta-material, so EM waves decays strongly when propagating through this structure; (2)
As shown in Fig.(2) and Fig.(3b), there exists a continual dispersion curve in the frequency region [0.2545(2πc/a), ω0]
where ǫ(ω) < 0 and µ(ω) > 0.
It is not so surprise to ﬁnd that similar dispersion curves were reported in 2D
polaritonic PCs, due to the fact that the meta-materials in this frequency region have the same optical properties as
the polaritonic materials [13]; (3) A lot of near-dispersionless bands appear when the meta-materials are LH, which
are direct results of the coupling between the localized surface polaritons of an isolated cylinder. The most striking
feature of the near-dispersionless bands is that their group velocities are almost zero. (4) From 0.32728(2πc/a) to
0.35635(2πc/a), where the meta-materials are LH, the dispersion curve seems continual, except distorted by a lot of
anti-crossing, as clearly shown in Fig.(3c) and Fig.(4). The dispersion relation here has the same physical origin as
that in [0.35635(2πc/a), ωp], where the meta-material is single-negative with a negative ǫ(ω) and a positive µ(ω). A
direct evidence can be found from the unbroken band structure shown in the inset of Fig.(2), where the dispersion
curve is continual from 0.32728(2πc/a) to about 0.6(2πc/a). This phenomena can also be explained by the long-
wavelength approximation, that is, when the wavelength of the propagating EM wave is much longer than the lattice
constant of PC, the dispersion relationship becomes approximately linear, and PC is eﬀectively homogeneous under
this circumstance. Note that the eﬀective refractive index of the LH meta-materials in this region is very close to
zero, as shown in Fig.(1b). In order to explain it more clearly, we plot the dispersion relationship of the eﬀectively
homogeneous structure in Fig.(4). The eﬀective refractive index of the periodic structure used here is coarsely given
by,

¯n(ω) = [−πr2

ǫ(ω)µ(ω) + (a2 − πr2) × 1.0]/a2.

(4)

p

The dispersion relationship can be obtained by using the relation that k = ¯n(ω)ω/c. When plot it, we shift the
frequency upwardly 0.0258(2πc/a). It is clearly shown that these two curves have similar slopes, which means the
speed of the energy propagation (given by dω/dk) is almost same in the eﬀective structure and that in the periodic
structure. Hence, we can conclude that the long-wavelength approximation is validated here, and the group eﬀective

refractive index can be calculated by using Eq.(4). Note that Eq.(4) is very diﬀerent with Eq.(3): the index obtained
from last equation is always positive, in sharp contrast, the index calculated by the ﬁrst one can be zero, or even
negative.

When the average refractive index of a multilayer structure ¯n =

a
0 n(x)dx/a equals zero, where a is the lattice
constant, a band gap, namely zero ¯n gap, will appear in the band structure [9]. Our 2D sample has also such zero
R
¯n gap around ωa/2πc = 0.293125, as shown in Fig.(5). When the refractive index of the cylindric rods around this
frequency is about −2.5368, the average refractive index of the 2D PC, which is given by Eq.(4), is zero. Clearly,
in our case, the zero-¯n gap is only one of many mini gaps induced by the anti-crossing behavior. Moreover, around
0.29307275(2πc/a), a very sharp peaks with very narrow bandwidth is shown in Fig. (5), and the ratio between the
peak frequency and the FWHM of the peak is as little as 6.8 × 10−8. This property can be used to design narrow-band
ﬁlter.

In conclusion, using an extended plane-wave-based transfer-matrix method, the photonic band structures and the
corresponding transmission spectrum of a two-dimensional left-handed photonic crystal are calculated. Comparisons
between the periodic structure with a single left-handed cylindric rod are made, and many interesting similarities are
found. It is shown that, due to the localized surface polaritons presented by an isolated left-handed rod, there exist
many exciting physical phenomena in high-dimensional left-handed photonic crystals. As direct results of coupling
of the localized surface polaritons of neighboring left-handed rod, a lot of almost dispersionless bands, anti-crossing
behavior, and a zero ¯n gap are exhibited in the left-handed periodic structure. Moreover, in a certain frequency
region, except distorted by a lot of anti-crossing behavior, there exists a continual dispersion relation, which can be
explained by the long-wavelength approximation. It is also pointed out that high-dimensional left-handed photonic
crystals can be used to design narrow-band ﬁlter.

I. APPENDIX: THE EXTENDED PLANE-WAVE EXPANSION TRANSFER-MATRIX METHOD

Divide a general three-dimensional (3D) PC into thin slices along the z-axis direction, within each slice ǫ and µ are
approximated as z-independent. Therefore, a partitioned lamellar slice can be approximated as a 2D grating [18]. We

denote the primitive lattice of the grating by two unit vectors a1 and a2, the corresponding reciprocal lattice by b1
and b1. We let an incident plane wave propagate along the z-axis with a wave vector k0 = (k0x, k0y, k0z). The EM
ﬁeld at an arbitrary point r can be expressed as a superposition of Bragg waves:

E(r) =

Eij(z)ei(kij,xx+kij,yy),

H(r) =

Hij(z)ei(kij,xx+kij,y y),

Xij

Xij

∇ × E(r) = ik0µ(r)H(r),
∇ × H(r) = −ik0ǫ(r)E(r).

where the Bragg wave vector kij = (kij,x, kij,y) = (k0x, k0y) + ib1 + jb2, Eij(z) and Hij(z) are expansion coeﬃcients
of the EM ﬁeld to be determined.

In the following we present a detailed description on how the eigenmodes of the EM ﬁeld within a 2D lamellar
grating slice are obtained on the plane-wave basis, and how the transfer-matrix connecting ﬁelds at two sides of the
grating slice is related to these eigenmodes. We start from Maxwell’s equations

Here ǫ(r) and µ(r) are periodic functions of the grating slice, they are homogeneous along the z axis within the slice.
We can rewrite the above equation into six partial-diﬀerential equations for (Ex, Ey, Ez) and (Hx, Hy, Hz). Ez and
Hz can be deleted from these six equations, since the physical parameters within each lamellar slice are independent
of z. This leads to the following four coupled equations

We can further write down the plane-wave expansion expressions for dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability,

Notice that the input of our approach is the frequency of the incident EM ﬁeld. The method can therefore
eﬀectively simulate dispersive PCs, even when their magnetic permeability and dielectric permittivity are all frequency-
dependent. Furthermore, it is important to note that our method can also simulate defective PCs [19, 20], such as
PC-based waveguides and microcavities, by combining with the supercell method. We can also utilize the symmetry
of the simulated structure to substantially ease the requirement of calculation capability as was already pointed out
[21].

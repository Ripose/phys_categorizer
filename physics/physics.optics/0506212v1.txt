Short title: Violation of EPR for perfect correlations

Abstract

Bell’s theorem reveals contradictions between the predictions of
quantum mechanics and the EPR postulates for a pair of particles
only in situations involving imperfect statistical correlations. How-
ever, with three or more particles, contradictions emerge even for per-
fect correlations. We describe an experiment which can be realized in
the laboratory, using four-photon entangled states generated by para-
metric down-conversion, to demonstrate this contradiction at the level
of perfect correlations.

1 Introduction

Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen [1] (EPR) presented their famous gedanken-

experiment in 1935 with the aim of showing that quantum mechanics (QM)

was not a complete description of physical reality. A complete description,

in their view, would require the introduction of additional variables, usually

referred to as hidden variables. They outlined a program to reproduce the

predictions of QM using local hidden variable (LHV) theories.

This program was challenged by Bell [2] in 1964 when he proved that

any hidden variable theory that incorporated the concepts of locality and

reality would be inconsistent with certain predictions of QM. In particular,

he showed [3] that it was possible to derive from the postulates of EPR

an inequality which was violated by statistical predictions of QM for a pair

of particles. This violation has been observed in a number of experiments

involving interference of pairs of photons produced in an entangled state [4-7].

A shortcoming of all these experiments is that, with a pair of particles,

Bell’s theorem reveals contradictions between the predictions of QM and

EPR’s postulates only in situations involving imperfect statistical correla-

tions: no contradictions appear with perfect correlations. A way to overcome

this limitation, which was proposed by Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger [8]

(GHZ) is to use three or more particles in an entangled state. Greenberger et

al. [9] (GHSZ) have shown that, in this case, contradictions emerge even at

the level of perfect correlations. They also described a gedankenexperiment

using three entangled photons to illustrate this point.

Recent work suggests that it is possible to generate entangled four-photon

states by parametric down-conversion of two pump photons [10]. Based on

this work, we describe a design for a four-photon interference experiment

3

which can be realized in the laboratory. We show how, with just two mea-

surements, one can demonstrate that quantum mechanics contradicts LHV

theories, even at the level of perfect correlations.

2 Generation of four photon entangled states

Parametric down conversion in a crystal exhibiting a χ(2) nonlinearity makes

it possible to convert a pump photon (frequency ωp) into a pair of highly
(2) =

correlated photons with frequencies ωd

(2), where ωd

(1) and ωd

(1) + ωd

ωp [11-13]. These photons are generated almost simultaneously (within the

correlation time τd of the down-converted photons). While the frequency of

each down-converted photon may vary over an appreciable range, the sum of

their frequencies is ﬁxed to within the pump bandwidth. The down-converted

photons are therefore described by an energy entangled state.

Recent work has shown that it should be possible to extend this process

to generate entangled four-photon states from two pump photons by achiev-

ing the required phase-matching conditions in a non-linear crystal with two

non-collinear pump beams [10]. While the susceptibility for this two-photon

down-conversion process is low, the gain depends on the second power of the

pump amplitude, so that it should be possible to obtain an appreciable yield

by using pulsed pump beams with high peak power. Further improvements

in yield may be possible by the use of a resonant cavity (See Appendix D for

further details of the experiment).

In such an arrangement,

ωd

(1) + ωd

(2) + ωd

(4) = 2ωp,

(1)

where ωd

(1),..., ωd

(4) are the frequencies of the down-converted photons and

ωp is the frequency of the pump photons, and

where kd

kp

(1) and kp

(2) are the wave vectors of the pump photons.

3 Four photon interferometer

The four-photon interferometer shown in ﬁgure 1 is an extension of a two-

photon interferometer described by Franson [5] in which each of the four

down-converted photons enters one of four interferometers, each with a short

path (sj) of length Sj and a long path (lj) of length Lj. The optical path

diﬀerence ∆Lj = Lj

Sj in each of the interferometers, which can be varied

by translating the right-angle prisms, is greater than the coherence length cτd

of the down-converted photons, so that no second-order interference eﬀects

due to single photons are observed in the individual interferometers.

If, in a pair of interferometers, we consider the four processes leading to

4 Four photon interference

A four-photon event is recorded when photons are detected in coincidence

(within the detector response time) in all the four interferometers. Since the

four photons are generated (almost) simultaneously, such a coincidence could

either be due to four photons which all took the short path (

in the four interferometers, so that

Φ = φ1 + φ2 + φ3 + φ4,

(4)

where φi = (ωp/2c)∆Li, (i = 1, ..., 4) is the phase diﬀerence between the

beams traversing the two arms of the ith interferometer. The predicted

coincidence count is obtained by squaring the amplitude and is therefore

proportional to

(1/2)(1 + exp(iΦ))

2 = (1/2)(1 + cos(Φ)),

(5)

|

|

where the constant of proportionality includes the intensity of the source,

the detector eﬃciency (See Appendix C) and the losses in the system. A

formal ﬁeld-theoretic analysis which leads to the same result is presented in

Appendix A. If the detectors are as nearly alike as possible, we can assume

fair sampling, so that the number of coincidences actually measured in any

situation is proportional to those expected for a perfect system.

As can be seen, QM predicts that the coincidence rate Rc depends only

on Φ, the sum of the phase delays φi in the four interferometers. The co-

incidences will be perfectly correlated (Rc = 1) when Φ = 0 and perfectly

anticorrelated (Rc = 0) when Φ = π. When Φ = 0, detection of a photon

in three interferometers would imply the coincident detection of a photon in

the fourth interferometer. When Φ = π, detection of a photon in three of the

interferometers would preclude the coincident detection of a photon in the

fourth interferometer. Let us deﬁne a parameter (analogous to the visibility

for sinusoidal fringes)

5 LHV predictions

It is convenient in discussing the four-photon interferometer to use the lan-

guage of spins traditionally used in the EPR literature. Traversals of the

long and short arms of an interferometer are thought of as basis states

l > correponding to “spin up” and “spin down” along the z axis. The

in spin language, is a state on the equator of the Poincar´e sphere of states of

a spin-half particle where

l > and

s > are the North and South poles. The

|

choice of a phase delay φi in the ith interferometer corresponds to the choice

y plane along which one measures spin in Bohm’s

version [17] of the EPR gedankenexperiment.

−

An LHV description [8] of the four photon interferometer requires the use

of a space Λ, the space of complete states whose elements are written λ, with

a probability measure ρ. The expectation value of coincidence counts is then

1 + EΨ(φ1, φ2, φ3, φ4)
2

,

where

EΨ(φ1, φ2, φ3, φ4) = < A(φ1)B(φ2)C(φ3)D(φ4) >

and Aλ(φ1), Bλ(φ2), Cλ(φ3), Dλ(φ4) are four functions of λ which take values

1. Locality is built into the theory by the fact that Aλ(φ1) is independent

±
of φ2, φ3, φ4, Bλ(φ2) is independent of φ1, φ3, φ4, and so on.

5.1 Perfect correlations: ideal experiment

Following GHZ [8, 9] we can show that an LHV theory cannot reproduce the

predictions of QM even at the level of perfect correlations.

Proof: Let us suppose functions Aλ(φ1), Bλ(φ2), Cλ(φ3), Dλ(φ4) exist, sat-

isfying the relations

and

< A(φ1)B(φ2)C(φ3)D(φ4) >= 1, for Φ = 0,

Aλ(0)Bλ(0)Cλ(φ)Dλ(φ) = 1.

Multiplying equations (14) and (15), we get, since (Aλ(

φ))2 = (Bλ(0))2 = 1,

−

However, if we set φ = π/2 in equation (18), it contradicts equation (13).

It follows that functions Aλ(φ1), Bλ(φ2), Cλ(φ3), Dλ(φ4) satisfying equations

(12) and (13) do not exist. Accordingly, LHV theories cannot reproduce the

predictions of QM even at the level of perfect correlations.

5.2 Perfect correlations: real experiment

From section 4 we see that QM predicts a

of unity in an ideal experiment.

[18], “if a theorem is valid whenever we have perfect correlations, it cannot

be totally wrong in the case of almost perfect correlations”. We show below

that with four-photon interference, a value of

greater than 0.5 is enough to

rule out LHV theories. We do this by going beyond the original argument of

GHZ [8, 9] to allow for experimental imperfections(

Note that in our adaptation of the original GHZ argument [8, 9], it is

not necessary to set the individual phase diﬀerences φ1, ..., φ4 to 0 (or, more

correctly, 2mπ):

it is only necessary to set Φ, the sum of these phase dif-

ferences, to 0 (or 2mπ). In practice, it is diﬃcult (nearly impossible) to set

the individual phase diﬀerences to any preassigned value, since the optical

path diﬀerences in the individual interferometers are greater than the coher-

ence lengths of the down-converted photons; our adaptation eliminates this

problem and makes the experiment feasible.

In the actual experiment, one of the four interferometers is adjusted ini-

tially so that the coincidence rate is a maximum. The ﬁrst measurement

therefore corresponds to the condition Φ = 2mπ. A phase shift of π is then

introduced in any one of the interferometers and the event rate is measured

at the resulting minimum. (Note that the introduction of a further phase

shift of π in any of the interferometers would bring the event rate back to

a maximum). The results of these two measurements are inserted in equa-

tion (6) to obtain the value of the quantity

. Any value greater than 0.5

Q

represents a breakdown of LHV theories under perfect correlations.

The only data used correspond eﬀectively to values of Φ of 0 (eq. 22) and

π (eq. 23). This is very much in the spirit of the original GHZ argument

[8, 9], which relies only on perfect correlations.

12

5.3 Statistical correlations

This experiment also makes it possible to demonstrate violations of the orig-

inal Bell inequality (which uses statistical correlations for two particles) in

systems of four particles. In this case, it is not necessary to adjust the value

of Φ for the ﬁrst measurement so that the coincidence rate is a maximum;

Φ can have any arbitrary value (say) Φ0. Three more measurements of the

event rate are then made after introducing phase shifts of π/2, successively,

in three of the interferometers. We then have four values of the event rate

corresponding to values of Φ of Φ0, Φ0 + π/2, Φ0 + π and Φ0 + 3π/2.

If one assumes that the fringe proﬁle is sinusoidal, one can easily de-

termine the fringe visibility from these four measurements. Whereas quan-

tum mechanics predicts a visibility of unity, it has been shown [20, 21, 22]
that LHV theories cannot explain a fringe visibility greater than 1/(2√2).

In this respect, a four-photon experiment oﬀers a more probing test than

three-photon experiments for which the critical visibility is 1/2. However, as

explained in [21] this lower value for the critical visibility relies on the use of

statistical correlations rather than perfect correlations.

6 Conclusion

While most theoretical studies related to EPR have involved spin-(1/2) par-

ticles, actual experiments have used optical analogs of such systems.

In

particular, all interferometric tests of Bell’s inequality carried out so far have

used entangled two-photon states [4-7]. In this case, LHV theories do not

contradict QM at the level of perfect correlations. Therefore, tests of LHV

theories with two-photon states require measurements of statistical correla-

tions. EPR experiments involving more than two particles (as in section 5.3)

13

utilize extensions of Bell’s inequality and, therefore, also involve statistical

correlations. On the other hand, tests such as those described in section

5.2 are based on the GHZ analysis [8, 9] and, therefore, only involve perfect

correlations. Since perfect correlations formed the basis of the original EPR

criterion for “elements of reality”, the contradiction emerging from the GHZ

analysis [8, 9] strikes at the heart of the EPR program. We have described a

realizable experiment involving four-photon interference which demonstrates

the conﬂict between EPR and QM even at the level of perfect correlations.

Appendix A

The ﬁeld theoretic analysis presented by Franson [5] can be easily extended

to the case of four-photon interference. A ﬁeld theoretic description has the

advantage that it is manifestly local. We sketch the main ideas below using

his notation.

We need only deal with scalar ﬁelds since the polarization is ﬁxed through-

out. The scalar ﬁeld operator ψ(~r, t) is expanded in free space modes as

ψ(~r, t) =

a~k
√V

−

The time evolution of this operator is governed by the free Hamiltonian of

the electromagnetic ﬁeld and since

ψ(x + c∆t, t) = ψ(x, t

∆t),

−

the particle it describes moves at the speed of light.

The ﬁeld operator at the detector of the ith interferometer with the beam

splitter removed is given by ψ0(~ri, t). For each pair (i, j) of the interferome-

ters, these operators satisfy the condition

ψ0(~ri, t)ψ0(~rj, t

(36)

which is analogous to Franson’s equation (5). With the beam splitter inserted

in the interferometer, the ﬁeld operator at the ith detector becomes

ψ(~ri, t) = (1/2)(ψ0(~ri, t) + exp(iφi)ψ0(~ri, t

∆t)),

Let us consider three real-valued functions f, g, h on Λ. One can think of

these functions as elements of a vector space. We only need to work in

a three dimensional subspace containing f, g, h. If f, g, h are unit vectors,

< f g >= cos(θf g), < gh >= cos(θgh) and < f h >= cos(θf h), where the

angles θf g, θgh, θf h are deﬁned to be less than π and represent the angles

between the unit vectors f, g, h. These angles can also be interpreted as the

lengths of the shortest geodesics between the tips of the vectors f, g, h on the

unit sphere. From the triangle inequality, it then follows that

Both these inequalities express the idea that if f and g are highly correlated

and g and h are highly correlated, then f and h must be correlated to some

extent.

Appendix C: Detector eﬃciency

In avalanche photodiodes, the only signiﬁcant loss mechanism is reﬂection

of the incident photons. The detection eﬃciency is therefore given by the

η = 1

R,

−

(47)

where R is the fraction of photons reﬂected at the surface of the photocath-

ode. It is, therefore, possible to reduce the loss due to this cause to negligible

levels by using a number of photodiodes in a light- trapping arrangement [29].

A simple trap-detector which can be used for photon counting uses only

two photodiodes [30]. In this arrangement, as shown in Fig.2, the incident

beam undergoes three reﬂections at the photodiodes before exiting. The

fraction of the photons lost by reﬂection is then

and summation of the outputs of the two photodiodes should yield a detection

R2 = R3,

η2 = 1

R3.

−

With commercial avalanche photodiodes, for which R is typically around 0.3,

it should be possible to obtain an increase in detection eﬃciency from 70%

eﬃciency

to 97%.

with high peak power can be several orders of magnitude greater than that

obtained with continuous-wave excitation at the same average power.

With a laser generating pulses with a duration of 1 µs, at a repetition

rate of 10 pulses/second, it should be possible to obtain a peak power that
is 105 times greater than the average power, and an improvement in down-

conversion eﬃciency by a factor of this order. Accordingly, with an average

power of 100 mW (corresponding to a peak power of 10 kW), it should be

19

possible to obtain a total down-converted ﬂux in the four output beams of
103 photons/second, or 103 photons/second in each beam. After allowing

4

for losses, it should be possible to obtain a ﬂux of 100 photons/second at

×

the output from each of the four interferometers, which should permit useful

measurements.

The use of a pulsed pump beam might be expected, at ﬁrst sight, to create

problems connected with the spectral coherence of the pump beams and the

time resolution of the detectors. However, with a pulse duration of 1 µs, the

coherence length of the pump beams, with a properly designed laser cavity,

would be greater than 100 m. On the other hand, the coherence length of

the down-converted beams, which would be determined by the decay time

of the cavity modes (in this case, about 0.5 ns), would be less than 0.15 m.

Accordingly, it would be possible to avoid second-order interference fringes

by working with an optical path diﬀerence greater than this value, without

a signiﬁcant loss in the visibility of fourth-order interference eﬀects.

As mentioned earlier, with a crystal placed in a resonant cavity, the light

beams have an intrinsic bandwidth determined by the bandwidth of the cav-

ity. This is consistent with the picture that the four down-converted photons

are produced simultaneously, but then escape independently within a time

interval equal to the decay time of the cavity [27, 28], which, as mentioned

earlier, is around 0.5 ns. Since this time interval is much less than the time

resolution of a fast photodetector (say, 1.5 ns), the eﬀects of such a deviation

from simultaneity would not be noticeable.

Finally, we need to consider the probability of accidental coincidences.

Since the output from each interferometer consists of a series of pulses with

a duration of 1 µs, each containing about 10 photons, the probability of de-

tecting a single photon in a time window of 1.5 ns would be 0.015. The ratio

20

of the probability of accidental coincidences at the four outputs, due to un-

correlated photons, to that for actual coincidences would be only marginally

higher, at around 0.02. This proportion of accidental coincidences should not

have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the visibility of fourth-order interference eﬀects

produced by the four down-converted beams.

Abstract

The results of experimental testing the existence of intense Lorentzian–
like wings with FWHM ∼ 4.5cm−1 in the absorption spectra of polyatomic
molecules in a gas phase are presented. Two independent experimental
methods were used for evaluating the integral intensity of the line wings
for a number of substances.
In the ﬁrst case, the cross–section of the
far wings of absorption bands in a gas phase spectrum were measured.
Then, these band wings were extrapolated inside the contour of absorp-
tion band. In the second case, the saturation degree of the linear spectrum
of molecules was determined. Radiation of a pulsed CO2–laser was used at
low gas pressure ( ∼ 16 mtorr) and averaged excitation level of molecules
< n > ∼ 0.1 quanta/molecule. The values obtained by these two inde-
pendent methods coincide for a variety of molecules. The average relative
integral intensity of the line wings varied from ∼ 0.6% for SF6 and SiF4
to ∼ 90% for (CF3)2O and (CF3)2CO.

1 Introduction

The phenomenon of the infrared multiple–photon excitation (IR MPE) and
collisionless dissociation of polyatomic molecules was discovered in works [1,2].
Numerous works were carried out later aimed to clearify the mechanism of this
process. This interest was stimulated by the fact, that the widths both of
laser radiation and molecule absorption lines are several orders of magnitude
lower, than the anharmonicity of molecular vibrations.
In the ﬁrst work [1]
the hypothesis of the existence of the so–called ”quasicontinuum” of vibrational
states was proposed. Despite some argued criticism [3], this idea has got the
broadest distribution.

In the recent years, however, the views on the nature of ”quasicontinuum”
have changed dramatically. Earlier, it was accepted, that ”quasicontinuum”
consists of a huge number of narrow lines arising as a result of coupling diﬀer-
ent vibrational states. Now it is widely believed [4], that the absorption line
is unique, but it becomes very wide. The origin of the ”quasicontinuum” now
is bounded up with intramolecular vibrational relaxation (IVR). This is a rea-
sonable idea. The IVR process can be very fast (picosecond timescale). The
corresponding Lorentzian width of the absorption line can be in this case com-
parable with anharmonisity of the molecular vibrations. The main disadvantage

1

of this model is that it does not explain how the molecules can be excited in
the ﬁeld of low vibrational levels, where the IVR is absent and the absorption
lines remain narrow. Experiments show, that excitation of molecules in this
area occurs without essential diﬃculties, but the theory gives no satisfactory
explanation of this fact.

In works [5,6] an idea was proposed, that the IR MPE process is a trivial
result of absorption in the area of line wings, but untrivial is the nature of these
wings. Practically, the possible role of line wings was not discussed in the liter-
ature earlier. It is, apparently, due to the fact, that appropriate estimations can
easily be made. The lifetime of excited states of molecules due to spontaneous
emission in the infrared region lays in the millisecond timescale. The natural
width of line must to be smaller than 100Hz. Even for the strongest molecular
transitions, at the distance from the line center equal to the value of molecular
angarmonicity, the Lorentzian countour of the natural width would have an ab-
sorption cross–section smaller then 10−25 cm2. This cross–section cannot play
any appreciable role in overcoming the angarmonicity of molecular vibrations.
However, such an estimation has not been tested in experiment earlier. It is
possible to assume, that for some unknown reasons, intensity of real line wings
is much higher, than the theory predicts. How high the intensity of line wings
should be to explaine the observable eﬀect of laser excitation of molecules?
Rather correctly such information can be derived from the experimental results
of works [7-9], where the depletion of rotational states of SF6 molecules by
TEA CO2–laser radiation was studied in the conditions of molecular jet. The
results of such processing are presented in Fig.1. Except for the usual narrow
component of the line with a Doppler width ∼ 30M Hz, the wings, or more
precisely speaking, a wide component of the line should exist with a cross–
section σ ≃ 6 · 10−20 cm2 and with a Lorentzian full width at half medium
2Γ ∼ 4.5 cm−1. The relative integral intensity of this component is rather
small, X ∼ 0.2%, but it is high enough for eﬃcient excitation of molecules from
all rotational states.

The purpose of the present work is an experimental testing the hypothesis
of the existence of intense line wings. First of all, it is important to point out
that the Lorentzian countor is rather ﬂat and the wings of the line can manifest
themselves as far natural wings of absorption bands. Numerous literature exists
about the far wings of absorption bands for small and light molecules which
are due to collisional broadening of the lines [10,11], but publications devoted
to the far wings of absorption bands in the gas phase for heavy polyatomic
molecules are absent. In the present work, for the ﬁrst time, far natural wings
of absorption bands are discovered for a number of polyatomic molecules. The
experiments show, that the absorption cross–section in the region of these far
band wings is independent on the gas pressure. Measuring the intensity of the
far band wings allows to estimate the relative integral intensity of the line wings.
On the other hand, it is important to pay attention to the phenomenon of
saturation of the absorption spectrum of polyatomic molecules by laser radiation
at low gas pressure [12]. It is well known, that for some molecules this saturation
can be very pronounced, but for the others it is minimal [13]. A satisfactory

2

explanation of this distinction was not found. From the point of view of the
discussed hypothesis, the distinction is due to the diﬀerence in relative intensities
of the line wings: for the molecules with a large relative intensity of the line
wings the saturation is minimal and vise versa.

So, the saturation degree of the absorption spectrum of polyatomic molecules
can be used to estimate the relative integral intensity of the line wings. With
this purpose, in the presented work, the saturation degree of the linear ab-
sorption spectra of a number of molecules by the TEA CO2–laser radiation
was investigated. The measurements were conducted in comparable conditions
at low gas pressure and at average level of molecular excitation < n >∼ 0.1
quanta/molecule. It was supposed, that under these conditions the narrow com-
ponent of the line is completely saturated, but the wide one is not. Then the
measured saturation degree can be regarded as a rough estimation of the rela-
tive integral intensity of the line wings. Estimations of the line wings intensity
obtained by two independent methods were compared with each other for a
number of molecules.

Experimental

The TEA CO2–laser with an additional low pressure cell inside the resonator
was used. When a low pressure cell was switched on, the TEA CO2–laser
switched from the multimode regime to the single–mode one. Using a nitrogen
free gas mixture allowed to obtain a pulse of generation with ∼ 150ns duration
at half height without a ”tail”.

A piroelectric detector was used for measuring the laser radiation absopbtion
at low gas pressure. The technique of experiments is similar to that described
in [14]. The piroelectric detector was placed inside the cell (pass lenght 110cm)
on the distance 10mm from the laser beam. Calibration of the detector’s sen-
sitivity was carried out by measuring the attenuation of the transmitted beam
at relatively high gas pressure (> 100mT orr).

Measurements of the absorption cross–section in the region of the far band
wings in some cases were carried out with an optico–acoustic detector (OAD).
This detector was also used to study the inﬂuence of the buﬀer gas pressure on
the intensity of the far band wings. In the last case, ﬁrst of all, the dependence
of the OAD sensitivity on the gas pressure was measured. The cell was ﬁlled
with ∼ 40 mTorr of hexaﬂuoroacetone and it was irradiated by TEA CO2 laser
on 10R(12) line with energy ∼ 1mj. Under these conditions, the amount of
energy, absorbed in the cell, remains constant, and the dependence of the OAD
signal on the buﬀer gas (nitrogen) pressure, becomes the dependence of the
detector’s sensitivity on the gas pressure. Then the cell was ﬁlled with 1T orr
of the substance to study (CF2Cl2, SiF4) and 1 − 800T orr of nitrogen was
added. The energy of a pulse laser radiation was usually 30 − 70mj and it’s
wavelenghth was selected in the region, where the far band wings had suﬃciently
clean countor and the absorption cross–section in the range 10−21 − 10−22cm2.
An IR–spectrophotometer with a stainless steel cell (pathlenth 10cm and

3

gas pressure up to 5atm) was used to study the absorption band proﬁle for a
number of molecules. Most of the used substances were commertially available
and had been used without puriﬁcation. Completely ﬂuoreneted dimethylether
was obtained by rectiﬁcation of the products’ mixture after ﬂuorenation of the
dimethilether. The gas used in the experiments contained ∼ 97% of the basic
substance. As an impurity, (∼ 3%) of the CF3H was present.

3 Results

Typical results of the experimental study are presented in Figs. 2 and 3. These
pictures show the saturation degree of linear absorption spectrum by pulse laser
radiation of the SF6 and (CF3)2CO molecules. In the ﬁrst case the saturation
is very high, and in the second one it is minimal in full agreement with early
results [13,15]. At average level of excitation ∼ 0.1 quanta/molecule, with 1
atm of buﬀer gas added, the measured absorption cross-section of the laser
radiation practically coincides with the same cross-section (σ0), obtained with
a spectrophotometer.

Table 1 contains main results of these experiments.

The measured absorption cross-sections are usually greater for multimode
laser radiation (σm) than for the singlemode one (σ1) [16]. Owing to limited

4

sensitivity of the piroelectric detector the minimum used gas pressure was chosen
100 mTorr in some cases. For these cases, the obtained ﬁnal value X = σ1/σ0
is overestimated by a factor of ∼ 1.6.

In Fig.4, the spectral dependence of the absorption cross-section of SiF4
molecules around the ν3 absorption bands is presented. The edges of the ab-
sorption band have approximately an exponential form, the slope beeng greater
for the blue side, than for the red one. At the distance more, than 25–40 cm−1
from the band center, much more glantly sloping wings are observed. The curve
(2) is a Loretzian proﬁle with FWHM 2Γ = 4.5cm−1, which passes through the
point with minimal absorption cross-section in the given spectral range. So, we
can see, that far band wings have a Lorentzian behavior.

In Fig.5 a spectral dependence of the absorption cross-section of SF6 molecules

is shown. In this rather typical case the far band wings are masked by intense
combination bands.

The same results for the CF2Cl2 molecules are shown in Fig. 6.

In the
latter case the far band wings can be observed in rather limited spectral range
950 − 1000cm−1.

Fig.7 shows the spectrum of the (CF3)20 molecules. The basis of the spectral
dependence well coordinate with a Lorentzian contour, which center coincides
with the most intense absorption band. It can be seen also, that intensity of the
Lorentzian contour in this case approximately two orders of magnitude higher,
than for the cases of SiF4 and SF6 molecules, although the intensities of the
strongest absorption bands are comparable for all these molecules.

The experiments have shown, that the absorption cross-section of the inves-
tigated molecules in the region of far wings of their absorption bands depends
neither on it’s own gas pressure, nor on the buﬀer gas pressure (in the range
8– 800 Torr of nitrogen). It means, that the far wings of absorption bands are
natural and have no relation to the collisional broadening of the lines.

The computed relative integral intensities of the line wings are listed in
Table 2. It was supposed, that 2Γ = 4.5cm−1 in all cases. For comparison, the
ﬁnal results of Table 1 are also shown here. It is visible,that the diﬀerence in
relative integral intensities of the line wings reaches two orders of magnitude
for diﬀerent molecules. At the same time, the maximum deviation between
the estimations, obtained by two independent methods, does not exceed three
times. The intensity of the line wings is rather small for the molecules with
one central atom and grows quickly with increasing the number of atoms and
branching degree of the molecules.

Close, although not so precise as from works [7-9], estimations of the parameters
of the wide component of line for SF6 molecules (σ ∼ 10−19cm2 and Γ < 3cm−1)
can be obtained by processing the experimental results of work [17].
In this
latter work the absorption of CW CO2 -laser radiation by SF6 molecules was
studied in the molecular beam conditions, and the autors dealt practically only
with the line wings.

A substantial diﬀerence exists between the estimations of the relative integral
intensity of the line wings for SF6 molecules, derived from works [7-9] (X ≃
0.2%) and obtained in the present work (X = 0.6 − 0.8%). This is obviously due
to the fact, that in the ﬁrst case the molecules were located at a zero vibrational
level, and the second estimation is obtained for the room temperature, when
the majority of molecules is in diﬀerent excited states. The strong temperature
dependence of the laser radiation absorption by SF6 molecules [17] allows to
assume, that the intensity of line wings substantially grows with increasing the
level of vibrational excitation of molecules. This is maybe the main physical
reason of formation of ensembles of ”hot” and ”cold” molecules under action of
the pulse CO2 laser radiation [18].

It is visible from Table 2, that for the largest molecules a systematic un-
derestimation exists when the intensity of the far band wings is used. This is
maybe due to the real width of line wings for large molecules is smaller, than
it was supposed in calculations. Such an assumption agrees with the results
of experimental study of photodissociation of a number of molecular dimers in
[19], where the the autors dealt generally with the same wings of lines. With
increasing the molecular weight the spectral photodissociation width of the cor-
responding dimer usually decreases: for (C2H4)2), (SiF4)2, and(SF6)2 the cor-
responding values are 12, 4.7, and 1.5cm−1, accordingly.

The diﬀerence in absorption of the singlemode and multimode laser radiation
has, obviously, common nature with a similar eﬀect, observed earlier in works
[16,17]. This is possible only in the conditions, when the IVR process is absent in

6

a molecule. Therefore, it can be expected, that in the (CF3)2CO and C6H5SiF3
molecules the fast IVR occurs already after the absorption of the ﬁrst quantum
of CO2 laser radiation. More precisely this question could be cleariﬁed after
studying the full spectrum of these molecules in the conditions of a free jet,
when the IVR process can frequently be identiﬁed [20].

The results of the present work, combined with experimental data of works
[7-9, 17], provide quite suﬃcient proof of existence of the intense line wings in
polyatomic molecules. The nature of these wings can be related with breaking
the mechanism of averaging the molecular inertia moment on the timescale of
vibrational motion. The spectroscopic methods allow a high precision deter-
mination of the inertia moment of a molecule, this moment being an averaged
inertia moment because it changes by 5−10% on the timescale of vibrational mo-
tion [21]. If one supposes that the mechanism of averaging the inertia moment
can suﬀer periodic short–time breakings (destructions) by various vibrational
modes, then we should get a clump of lines in the spectrum instead of a single
narrow line. The width of this clump of lines must apparently be determined
by the maximum amplitude of the molecule inertia moment variations due to
vibrations. Such the objects have been intensively studied in the last years,
and the autors tried to explain their nature by coupling of diﬀerent vibrational
modes [22]. The very moment of breaking-up (destruction) can be considered as
some short–life ”stressed” state of the molecule, which should be corresponded
with some wide component in the line spectrum. So, while it is not clear, which
eﬀect is responsible for the spectral width of such a component, it is worth not-
ing, that the width itself, retrieved from the experiments, is comparable to the
period of vibrational motion of atoms in a molecule.

Molecular beam with a cryogenic bolometer is ideally suitable for the study
of line wings. Narrow and powerful laser radiation interacts mainly with the line
wings [17]. Low rotational temperature in the beam results in that the width
of the absorption band is comparable with or less than that of the line wings.
Therefore, for precise determination of the width of the line wings it is not
necessary to investigate very far wings of the absorption bands. The sensitivity
of the apparatus can easily be calibrated using large polyatomic molecules like
as hexaﬂuoroacetone. Upon calibration, such an instrument can be used for
measuring the intensity and the width of the line wings for most polyatomic
molecules. Using one CO2–laser, we can measure the line wing parameters
for the 1 ← 0 transition. Having two CO2–lasers, we can obtain the same
information for the 2 ← 1 transition and even for the 3 ← 2 one ( if at the ﬁrst
step we make use of one of the twoquantum transitions, studied in [23] ).

5 Conclusion

The discussed experimental results quite clearly show the existence of intense
line wings of unknown nature in polyatomic molecules. This line wings are
interesting in itself. But it is also very important, that such kind of experiments
[17] gives for the present day the only straightforward experimental proof of the

7

strong time invariance violation in a photon-molecule interaction [24,25].

So, the task of experimental study of the line wings of polyatomic molecules
has a grate importance. Unfortunately, the experimentalists are afraid to work
with this interesting and unusual physical object.

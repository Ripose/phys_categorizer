Abstract

We present a statistical analysis of time-resolved spontaneous emission decay curves from ensem-

bles of emitters, such as semiconductor quantum dots. We derive the relation between the density

of excited emitters and the luminescence decay curve. Contrary to what is widely assumed, the den-

sity of excited emitters and the intensity in a emission decay curve are in general not proportional.

This has important implications for non-single-exponential models; for example, the normalisation

of the stretched-exponential model is ill-deﬁned for emitters with a realistic quantum eﬃciency

of less than 100 %. We deduce the proper normalization and the average decay times for the

single-exponential model, the stretched-exponential model, and for a continuous distribution of

rates. We also derive the relation between any non-single-exponential luminescence decay curve

and a continuous distribution of decay rates. The distribution is identiﬁed as the distribution of

total decay rates weighted with the radiative rates. In this general case, the well-known emission

quantum eﬃciency does not have a single value anymore, but it is also distributed. We apply our

analysis to examples of colloidal quantum dot emission in suspensions and in photonic crystals.

INTRODUCTION

Understanding the decay dynamics of excited states in emitters is of key importance

for getting insight in many physical, chemical and biological processes. For example, in

biophysics the inﬂuence of F¨orster resonance energy transfer on the decay dynamics of donor

molecules is studied to quantify molecular dynamics1. In cavity quantum electrodynamics,

modiﬁcation of the density of optical modes (DOS) is quantiﬁed by measuring the decay

dynamics of light sources. According to Fermi’s ’Golden Rule’ the radiative decay rate is

proportional to the DOS at the location of the emitter2. Atoms3,4, dye molecules5,6 and

nanocrystalline quantum dots7,8 are used as light sources in a wide variety of systems.

Several groups studied the inﬂuence of the local density of optical modes (LDOS) on the

radiative decay rate of light sources in front of a mirror3,4,5,6. Such lifetime experiments

are widely performed in cavities9 and many diﬀerent kinds of photonic materials, including

metallic ﬁlms10,11, two12,13-, and three-dimensional14 photonic crystals.

2

Fig. 1 shows how various observable parameters are related to the decay of an excited

state X ∗ to the ground state X.

In photoluminescence lifetime measurements the decay

of the number of excited emitters is probed by recording a photoluminescence decay curve

(f (t)). The number of excited emitters c(t) can be probed directly by transient absorption

measurements15,16,17 and non-radiative decay can be recorded with various photothermal

techniques18,19 (see Fig. 1). In this paper we discuss photoluminescence lifetime measure-

ments, which are generally recorded by time-correlated-single-photon-counting. The decay

curve consists of a histogram of the distribution of arrival times of single photons after many

excitation-detection cycles1. The histogram is modelled with a decay-function from which

the decay time of the process is deduced. In the simplest case when the system is charac-

terized by a single decay rate, the decay curve is described by a single-exponential function.

However, in many cases the decay is much more complex7,14,20. It is a general problem to

model those complex multi-exponential decays: often the choice of the model is not justi-

ﬁed a priori and only accepted on the basis of ﬁt-quality. Double- and triple-exponential

functions or models with a particular distribution of single-exponentials are used15,21,22,23,24.

Sometimes double- and triple-exponential models are justiﬁed on the basis of prior knowl-

edge of the emitters1. However, in many cases no particular multi-exponential model can

be anticipated on the basis of physical knowledge of the system studied.

Besides these multi-exponential models, the stretched-exponential model or Kohlrausch

function25 is frequently applied. The stretched-exponential function has been applied almost

universally to model diﬀusion processes26, dielectric relaxation27, capacitor discharge28, opti-

cal Kerr eﬀect experiments29 and luminescence decay30,31,32. The physical origin of the appar-

ent stretched-exponential decay in many processes remains a source of intense debate33,34,35.

In spite of the rich variety of examples where stretched- and multi-exponential models are

applied, there is no profound analysis of the models available in the literature. In this paper

we present a statistical analysis of single-, stretched-, and multi-exponential models and use

the analysis to model decay curves from ensembles of CdSe quantum dots in suspensions and

in photonic crystals. We show how the decay of the fraction of excited emitters is related

to the luminescence decay curve. In contradiction to what is assumed in many reports, the

concentration of excited emitters c(t) and the intensity in a luminescence decay measurement

f (t) are in general not proportional. This observation has important implications in case of

non-single-exponential decay. We deduce the proper normalization and the average lifetime

3

for single-, stretched-, and multi-exponential models. We show that the recovery of the

distribution of decay rates is more complex than generally assumed. In this case the well-

known emission quantum eﬃciency loses its meaning since it can not be expressed by a single

number anymore but is distributed. In order to take a distributed quantum eﬃciency into

account we introduce the distribution of the total decay rates weighted with the radiative

rate, which is the most general distribution that can be obtained from experiments.

II. DECAY MODELS

A. General considerations

A decay curve is the probability density of emission which is therefore a so-called proba-

bility density function g(t)36. This function tends to zero in the limit t → ∞. It is known

that the intensity g(t) is proportional to the time-derivative of the concentration of excited
) at time t′ is thus described
emitters c(t). The decay of the fraction of excited emitters c(t
with a reliability function or cumulative distribution function 1 − c(t
)
36. Here c(0) is the
c(0)
concentration of excited emitters at t′ = 0. The reliability function tends to zero in the limit

′

′

′

t

→ 0 and to 1 in the limit t

→ ∞. The fraction of excited emitters and the decay curve,

′

i.e., the reliability function and the probability density function36, are related as follows:

t

Z

g(t)dt = 1 −

′

c(t
)
c(0)

Physically this equation means that the decrease of the concentration of excited emitters

at time t

is equal to the integral of all previous decay events.

In many reports the dis-

′

tinction between the reliability function and the probability density function is neglected:

the intensity of the decay curve g(t) is taken to be directly proportional to the fraction of
excited emitters c(t

c(0) . The fact that the proportionality is not generally true has important

′

consequences for the interpretation of multi-exponential decay models.

B. Single exponential decay

It is well known that in case of ﬁrst-order kinetics the rate of decrease of the concentration

is constant in time:

dt′ = −Γc(t

where Γ the decay rate of the process. As a consequence, the concentration c(t

) decreases

′

single-exponentially in time:

′

c(t
)
c(0)

= exp(−Γt

)

′

The fraction of excited emitters in an ensemble can be described with the same terminology.
After excitation, the fraction decays with a single characteristic decay time τ = Γ−1, called

the lifetime. In the simplest case the decay curve is single-exponential, which means that

the decay of the excited state is characterized by a single rate constant Γ. Figure 2 shows a

luminescence decay curve of a dilute suspension of CdSe quantum dots in chloroform at a

wavelength of λ = 650 ± 5 nm37, with the number of counts on the ordinate and the time

on the abscissa. Clearly, the data agree well with single-exponential decay. This means that

1

all individual quantum dots emit light at this particular wavelength with the same rate of
39.0 ns−1. In Ref.37 it has been shown that the rate of emission strongly depends on the
emission frequency and that it is determined by the properties of the bulk semiconductor

crystal.

resulting in:

For emitters with a photoluminescence quantum eﬃciency less than 100 %, the excited

state is de-populated by both radiative and non-radiative processes, as illustrated in Fig.

1. Γrad is the radiative decay rate, Γnrad is the nonradiative decay rate and Γtot is the total

decay rate with Γtot = Γrad + Γnrad. The mathematical expression for the luminescence

decay curve can be obtained by inserting eq. 3 into eq. 1, where Γ is identiﬁed with Γtot,

g(t) = Γrad exp(−Γtott) + Γnrad exp(−Γtott)

In a luminescence decay measurement the recorded signal is proportional to the ﬁrst term

of g(t) only which will be called f (t):

(3)

(4)

(5)

f (t) = αΓrad exp(−Γtott)

and therefore a single-exponential luminescence decay process is modelled with eq. 5. The

pre-exponential factor α is usually taken as adjustable parameter, and it is related to several

experimental parameters, i.e., the number of excitation-emission cycles in the experiment,

the photon-collection eﬃciency and the concentration of the emitter. Henceforth α will be

omitted in our analysis. A comparison between eqs. 5 and 3 shows that in the case of

pure single-exponential decay neglect of the distinction between the reliability function (eq.

quantum dots (open dots, left axis). Data were collected at the red side of the emission maximum

of the suspension, at λ = 650 ± 5 nm. Single-exponential modelling (red dashed curve, right

axis) yields a decay time of 39.0±2.8ns and a χ2

r of 1.12. The average photon arrival time < t >,

calculated with eq. 7, is 39.1 ns.

3) and the probability density function (eq. 5) has no important consequences, since both

the fraction and the decay curve are single-exponential, and the pre-exponential α factor is

taken as adjustable parameter. The data in Fig. 2 are modelled with Eq. 5, with a pre-

exponential factor and Γtot as adjustable parameters. Clearly, our data are well described

by a single-exponential decay, as indicated by the quality-of-ﬁt χ2

r of 1.12, close to the ideal

value of 1.

Eq. 5 is a probability density function which means that the probability of emission in

a certain time-interval can be deduced by integration. The total probability for emission at

all times between t = 0 and t → ∞ is given by

is deﬁned as the probability of emission after excitation1. The correct recovery of this result

in the case of single-exponential decay is < t > equal to

< t > can be calculated with a spreadsheet program and no modelling is required. However,

this average time can only be calculated when the complete decay curve is recorded, i.e.,

when the tail of the decay curve reaches the noise-level. The average arrival time for the

data in Fig. 2 was < t >= 39.1 ns, very close to the value of 39.0 ±2.8ns obtained from

single-exponential modelling, which further conﬁrms the single-exponential character of the

decay curve.

C. Stretched exponential decay

In contrast to the example shown in Fig. 2, there are many cases in which decay curves

cannot be modelled with a single-exponential function. This usually means that the decay

is characterized by a distribution of rates instead of a single rate44. As an example, Fig.

3 shows a strongly non-single-exponential decay curve of spontaneous emission from CdSe

quantum dots in an inverse opal photonic crystal14,38. The non-single-exponential character

of the decay curve originates from the spatial and orientational variations of the LDOS

experienced by the quantum dots in the ensemble.

It is a general problem to describe

such relaxation processes which do not follow a simple single-exponential decay. Models

with many adjustable parameters will ﬁt the experimental data but lack a physical basis.

When only a few adjustable parameters are used it is frequently diﬃcult to ﬁnd an adequate

model. To strike a balance between the number of adjustable parameters and the quality of

the modelling the stretched exponential decay model25 is widely applied:

times between t = 0 and t → ∞, which yields 1. An important consequence is that eq.

9 is correctly normalized only for emitters with a quantum yield of 1 (Γrad = Γtot and

f(t)=g(t)). It is not clear how normalization should be done in realistic cases with quantum

yield < 100%. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has been overlooked in the

literature.

In contrast to the previous case of single-exponential decay, the reliability function and

the probability density function of a stretched exponential do not have the same form; the

probability density function contains a time-dependent pre-factor. Therefore, the relation

between the reliability function and the probability density function (eq. 1) has important

consequences. As an illustration, in Fig. 4 shows a stretched exponential decay function

(eq. 8) and the corresponding luminescence decay curve (eq. 9) for the example Γstr=1 and

β=0.5. It is clear that both curves are strongly diﬀerent. For a β-value of 0.5 the average

decay time of the reliability function (eq. 8) and of the probability density function (eq. 9)

9

diﬀer by more than a factor of ten. Thus it is important to take into consideration whether

eq. 8 or eq. 9 is used to describe the experimental photoluminescence decay curve. In many

reports30,31,32,35,39,40, the stretched exponential function that describes the fraction of excited

emitters is used to model the luminescence decay curve. We argue that using a stretched
exponential for the fraction c(t
)
c(0)

implies that the proper probability density function, i.e.,

′

eq. 9, must be used to model a luminescence decay curve. Fig. 3(a) shows the modelling

of experimental data with eq. 9, with Γstr and β as adjustable parameters. The β-value
was 0.42 and Γstr was 96.2 µs−1 ( 1
Γstr

= 10.4 ns). Modelling with stretched exponential is

obviously more satisfactory than single-exponential, but here fails at long times, reﬂected

by the high χ2

r-value of 60.7.

The main advantage of modelling with a stretched-exponential function is that the average

decay time < t > can readily be calculated. The average decay time can be deduced27:

strongly diﬀerent from the

-value of 10.4 ns.

In case of the stretched exponential model the distribution of the rates is unknown and

is generally deduced by solving the following equation21,30,39,40,41:

where σ(Γ) is the distribution function. To deduce σ(Γ) an inverse Laplace transform is

applied. For β 6= 0.5 and β 6= 1 there is no analytical solution of eq. 11 and for this reason

it is diﬃcult to deduce the distribution function22,27,34. This diﬃculty can be circumvented

by modelling directly with a known distribution function, as is shown below. It should be

noted that σ(Γ) does not represent the distribution of total decay rates, and its physical

interpretation is discussed in the next section.

10

D. Discrete distribution of decay rates

In case of multi-exponential decay, the photoluminescence decay curve is modelled by a

sum of single-exponentials. The decay curve has the following form:

f (t) =

ciΓrad,i exp(−Γtot,it)

(12)

1
c(0)

n

i=1
X

where n is the number of diﬀerent emitters (or alternatively the number of diﬀerent envi-

ronments of single emitters38), ci is the fraction of emitters that has a radiative decay rate

Γrad,i, and c(0) is the concentration of excited emitters at t = 0, i.e., the sum of all fractions.

Sums of two or three exponentials are frequently applied1. When the diﬀerent fractions (or

environments) are distributed in a particular way a distribution function ρ(Γtot) may be

used. Such a function describes the distribution or concentration of the emitters over the

emission decay rates at time t = 0. For example, the fraction of emitters with a total decay

rate Γtot,i is equal to

=

1
c(0)

(c(Γtot,i−1) + c(Γtot,i+1))

where ρ(Γtot,i) expresses the distribution with units s of the various components i over

ρ(Γtot)dΓtot = ρ(Γtot,i)∆Γtot

Γtot,i−1

Γtot,i+1

(13)

the rates Γtot,i. ∆Γtot is the separation between the various components i in the sum. Since

the distribution function is normalized, the sum of all fractions is equal to 1:

Taking a distribution function into account, the decay curve has the following mathemat-

In Eq. 15 every component in the sum is correctly normalized since every component is

multiplied with its radiative decay rate Γrad,i.

11

E. Continuous distribution of decay rates

For inﬁnitesimal small values of ∆Γtot, Eq. 15 can be written as an integral:

f (t) =

ρ(Γtot)Γrad exp(−Γtott)dΓtot

(16)

In the case of single-exponential decay the distribution function is strongly peaked around a

central Γtot-value, i.e., the distribution function is a Dirac delta function. Inserting a Dirac

delta function into Eq. 16 recovers Eq. 5:

f (t) =

δ(Γtot − Γtot′)Γrad exp(−Γtott)dΓtot

= Γrad exp(−Γtot′t)

(17)

0
Z

∞

This conﬁrms that the generalization to Eq. 16 is correct since it yields the correctly

normalized single-exponential functions.

In Eq. 16 it is assumed that for every Γtot there is one Γrad: the function Γrad(Γtot) relates

each Γtot to exactly one Γrad. In general both Γtot and Γrad vary independently, and Eq. 16

is rewritten to

∞

0

dΓtot exp(−Γtott)ρ(Γtot)

dΓradρΓtot(Γrad)Γrad

Γtot

Z

f (t) =

(18)

where ρΓtot(Γrad) is the normalized distribution of Γrad at constant Γtot. For every Γtot the

integration is performed over all radiative rates; a distribution of Γrad is taken into account

for every Γtot. Eq. 18 is the most general expression of a luminescence decay curve; from

this equation every decay curve with a particular distribution of rates can be recovered. An

example where Eq. 18 holds is an ensemble of emitters in a photonic crystal. In photonic

crystals the local density of optical states (LDOS) varies with the location in the crystal

and the distribution of dipole orientations of the emitters42. Therefore, a distribution of

emitters can, at a certain frequency and with a certain Γtot, emit light with a distribution

of radiative rates.

Interestingly, an ensemble of emitters with a distribution of rates Γtot is not completely

characterized by a single value of the quantum eﬃciency (see Eq. 6). Such an ensemble has

a distribution of quantum eﬃciencies, whose average quantum eﬃciency can be calculated

by integrating Eq. 18 for all times.

When an ensemble of emitters has a single radiative rate Γrad, i.e., ρΓtot(Γrad) is a delta-

function, and Eq. 18 reduces to Eq.

16. In this case the non-radiative rate may still be

distributed, and thus Eq. 16 suﬃces to describe the decay curve. Such a situation appears,

for example, with powders doped with rare earth ions43 and with polymer ﬁlms doped with

quantum dots30,32.

Most often, detailed information on the relation between Γtot and Γrad is not available.

Then, modelling directly with a distribution of decay rates is widely applied21,23,24,35,41.

This is a major advantage over modelling with a stretched exponential function, where it

is complicated to deduce the distribution of decay rates from the β-value. In all cases a

function of the following form is used to model the non-single-exponential decay curve:

f (t) =

σ(Γtot) exp(−Γtott)dΓtot

(19)

Comparing Eq. 19 with Eq. 18 reveals that σ(Γ) contains information about both the

radiative and non-radiative rate:

σ(Γtot) = ρ(Γtot)

ρ(Γrad)ΓraddΓrad

(20)

Z

Thus σ(Γ) is the distribution of total decay rates weighted by the radiative rate. In Eq. 19

the various components are not separately normalized as in Eq. 18. Modelling with Eq. 19

boils down to using an inﬁnite series of single-exponentials which are expressed with only a

few free parameters. The form of the distribution can usually not be predicted and a decision

is made on basis of quality-of-ﬁt. While a good ﬁt does not prove that the chosen distribution

is unique, it does extract direct physical information from the non-single-exponential decay

on an ensemble of emitters and their environment38.

F. Log-normal distribution of decay rates

Distribution functions that can be used for σ(Γ) are (sums of) normal, Lorentzian, and

log-normal distribution functions. In Fig. 3(b) the luminescence decay curve is modelled

with eq. 19, with a log-normal distribution of the rate Γ

where A is the normalization constant, Γmf is the most frequent rate constant (see Fig. 5).

γ is related to the width of the distribution:

σ(Γ) = A exp

−(

ln Γ − ln Γmf

∆Γ = 2Γmf sinh(γ)

where ∆Γ is equal to the width of the distribution at 1

e . The most frequent rate constant and
γ were adjustable parameters, only one extra adjustable parameter compared to a single-

exponential model. Clearly, this model (eq. 19 and 21) describes our multi-exponential

experimental data extremely well. The χ2

exponential modelling only results in a stretch-parameter which lacks a clear and direct

physical interpretation. The log-normal function is plotted in Fig. 5 (curve a). The broad

distribution of rates demonstrates the strongly non-single-exponential character of the decay

curve. In Ref.38 we were able to relate this broad distribution to the spatial variation of the

LDOS in inverse-opal photonic crystals. The same model was ﬁtted to the data of Fig. 2.
Γmf was 25.8 µs−1 ( 1

modelling of 39.0 ±2.8ns. The width of the distribution ∆Γ was 0.079 ns−1. The distribution

is plotted in Fig. 5 (curve b) and is narrow, which reveals the single-exponential character

of the decay curve.

It is widely assumed that σ(Γ) is equal to the distribution of total rates21,23,24,39,40. Com-

parison with eq. 18 shows that this is not true. From the log-normal distribution in Fig. 5 an

average rate can be deduced. However, this average is biased since the various components

are weighted with their quantum eﬃciency. Thus, in order to ﬁnd the true distribution of the

total decay rates and its average from the luminescence decay curve, additional knowledge

on the relation between Γtot and Γrad is indispensable.

III. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have presented a detailed analysis of the luminescence decay curve for an

ensemble of light emitters such as semiconductor quantum dots. The proper normalization

and the average decay time are derived for single-, stretched- and multi-exponential models

which are used to describe decay curves. A mathematical expression is given that relates the

fraction of excited emitters to the luminescence decay curve. The relation is not linear, con-

trary to what is often incorrectly assumed. We show that in case of the stretched-exponential

model the decay of the density of emitters and of the luminescence decay curve are strongly

dissimilar. Besides, the stretched exponential model lacks a clear statistical interpretation,

and its normalization is unclear for emitters with a realistic eﬃciency. Alternatively, models

which have a distribution of decay rates contain direct physical information. We have de-

rived the general expression for a decay curve in terms of the distributions of both radiative

and total decay rates, and we have derived the radiative decay weighted distribution of de-

cay rates, which can be obtained in practice from experimental data. We have successfully

modelled luminescence decay curves of quantum dots in suspension and in a photonic crystal

with a log-normal distribution of decay rates. Our analysis of the various exponential decay

models enables us to extract key information from the experimental luminescence decay

44 In the case of strong coupling in cavity quantum electrodynamics, the decay of even a single

emitter is not single-exponential. Experimental situations where this may be encountered are

emitters in a high-ﬁnesse cavity, or van Hove singularities in the LDOS of a photonic crystal.

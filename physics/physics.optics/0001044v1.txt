Abstract

We here present an investigation of the ringing eﬀect observed on the VIRGO
mode-cleaner prototype MC30. The results of a numerical calculation show how a
simple empirical formula can determine the cavity expansion rate from the oscilla-
tory behavior. We also show how the simulation output can be adjusted to estimate
the ﬁnesse value of the suspended cavity.

1 Introduction

Interferometric gravitational wave detectors, like VIRGO [1], LIGO [2], GEO [3]
and TAMA [4], make use of suspended Fabry-Perot cavities for their proper-
ties: spatial ﬁltering of the laser beam, optical path ampliﬁcation and power
recycling to name a few. Due to the suspension system, the motion of each
mirror is dominated by oscillations at the pendulum’s fundamental resonance,
typically below 1 Hz and with amplitudes as large as tens of a laser wave-
length.

A VIRGO mode-cleaner prototype MC30 [5], which operated in Orsay for sev-
eral years, consists of a 30 m triangular Fabry-Perot cavity with two possible
ﬁnesse values, 100 or 1600, depending on the incoming laser beam polariza-
tion state. The two-stage suspension system, together with a local damping

control system, results in a residual RMS displacement value, for each mirror,
of 0.8 µm.

Prior to the lock acquisition, the cavity length sweeps the optical resonance
at diﬀerent rates of expansion. If the relative velocity between the mirrors is
constant, the DC transmitted power delineates the Airy peak as a function of
time, easily observed for the optical system with F = 100. However, in the
case of F = 1600, a deformation of the Airy peak, similar to a ringing, was
observed (see ﬁg.(1)).

Both [6,7], and references therein, discuss this phenomenon. Brieﬂy, this eﬀect
arises once the cavity sweeps the optical resonance in a time τsw of the order
of or less than the cavity storage time τst = 2 L0 F /c π, where L0 = 30 m is
the cavity length and c the speed of light.

This eﬀect is observed when the rate of expansion is so high that, as resonance
is approached, the cavity doesn’t have enough time to completely ﬁll itself. It
is the beating between the incoming laser ﬁeld and the evolving stored ﬁeld
that gives rise to this oscillatory behavior.

The goal of this letter is to present the informations which can be extracted
from such deformation, in particular, the ﬁnesse of the cavity and the relative
mirror speed.

2 The ringing eﬀect in Fabry-Perot cavities

The model used for this study is shown in ﬁg.(2). Assuming a negligible mirror
displacement for times of the order of the round trip time of light τ = 2L0/c =
0.2µs, the stored ﬁeld Ψ1(t) at time t can be written as

Ψ1(t) = t1 Ψin + r2

1 exp(− 2 i k L ) Ψ1(t − τ )

(1)

where r1 and t1 denote the amplitude reﬂectivity and transmittivity of each
mirror, Ψin is the incoming laser ﬁeld, and L is the cavity length. Assuming
that the cavity expands at a constant rate v, we can write L = L0 + v t and
solve eq.(1) iteratively, for diﬀerent velocities v and ﬁnesse F .

Fig.(3) shows the Airy peak for three velocities: v = 0 (static approximation),
v = 1λ/s, and v = 2.6λ/s, with F = 4000. The curve labeled static, corre-
sponding to v = 0, was generated by neglecting the travel time of light, i.e the
cavity has reached its equilibrium point at each step. The two other curves,
on the other hand, were simulated according to the dynamical model here
presented. Notice how the main peak height decreases, its width increases and

its position shifts ahead of the resonance. These changes are greater for larger
velocities.

3 The speed measurement

We would now like to discuss a property of the ringing eﬀect observed from
the simulation runs. Fig.(3) graphs the stored power as a function of cavity
length for a given ﬁnesse and for diﬀerent values of velocity. We can now plot
the stored power as a function of time, setting the velocity to a ﬁxed value,
but varying the ﬁnesse. One example is given in ﬁg.(4). The top graph of this
ﬁgure shows the stored power as a function of time, for an expansion rate set
to v = 10λ/s, for three diﬀerent ﬁnesse values: F = 1000, 2000, and 3000.
The bottom graph is the curves’ time derivative. From these plots, we remark
a particular characteristic of the phenomenon: the position of the minima and
maxima, with the exception of the main peak, are almost independent from
the ﬁnesse value.

Furthermore, going back to ﬁg.(3), we can now note that the derivative zeros
depend only on the relative mirror velocity. The simulation output shown in
ﬁg.(4) not only shows how the derivative zeros are independent, at least to
ﬁrst approximation, from the ﬁnesse, but it also shows a particular regularity
in the spacing between the minima and maxima.

The upper graph of ﬁg.(5) shows the simulated stored power of a cavity with
F = 3500, expanding at a rate 10λ/s. Let the position of the curve’s derivative
zeros, tzero, be labeled by the index n, so that, for the ﬁrst zero, positioned at
tzero ≃ 5.07ms, n = 0, for the second zero, located at tzero ≃ 5.103ms, n = 1
and so on. Then, the bottom graph of ﬁg.(5) shows the plot of index n as a
function of time. We remark that the n-th zero of the derivative is a quadratic
function of the zero crossing time tzero: n ∝ t2
zero. By ﬁtting the simulation
outputs to the expression nzero = p1 + p2tzero + p3t2
zero where p1,2,3 are ﬁtting
parameters, we empirically found that the coeﬃcient p3 can be written as
p3 = cv/λL where L is the cavity length and v is the cavity expansion rate
(an example is shown in the bottom graph of ﬁg.(5)). Therefore, an estimate
of coeﬃcient p3 would also give us an estimate of the relative velocity v.

Fig.(6) shows the results of a ﬁt on a measured event. Notice how the parabolic
behavior is in agreement with the experimental points, resulting in a measured
speed of 12.8 ± 10−2µm/s.

4 The Finesse measurement

Once the speed is extracted, it is possible to ﬁt the measurements with the
simulation’s output to ﬁnd the remaining parameter: the ﬁnesse. The ﬁt results
of a set of measurements, six of which are shown in ﬁg.(7), led to a mean ﬁnesse
of F = 1554 ± 160, a value later conﬁrmed by a measurement of the cavity
pole. The ten percent precision on the ﬁnesse measurement is most probably
due to the alignment state of the cavity, as suggested by simulation studies.

5 Conclusion

An analysis of the optical ringing eﬀect, observed on the VIRGO mode-cleaner
prototype in Orsay, was here presented. We investigated a method to extract,
from the oscillatory behavior, both the relative mirror speed and the ﬁnesse
of the system.

The numerical results showed how the position of the oscillations’ minima and
maxima, when plotted as a function of time, weakly depend on the ﬁnesse value
and are completely determined by the cavity expansion rate as the resonance
is being crossed. In particular, we showed how a simple empirical formula can
determine the cavity expansion rate by observing these minima and maxima.

Once the speed was reconstructed, it was possible to ﬁt the measurements with
the simulation’s output and estimate the cavity’s ﬁnesse to F = 1554 ± 160.

The present letter gives an alternative method to the ﬁnesse measurement for
a suspended cavity. The simplicity in the velocity reconstruction algorithm
may be useful for a future control system capable of guiding the cavity into
lock.

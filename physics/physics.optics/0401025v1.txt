In a recent paper Altewischer et al reported experimental
results related to reﬂection properties of a bidimensional sub-
wavelength hole array. They underlined the non-reciprocal
properties of reﬂection. In addition, their results take a great
interest as reﬂection and transmission are both necessary for
a complete description and understanding of optical systems.
In the present paper, we investigate theoretically the device
studied by Altewischer et al and show that the results of sim-
ulations corroborate the experimental results.

Since many years, subwavelength hole arrays in metal-
lic ﬁlms have received considerable attention in the con-
text of the results report by Ebbesen et al. Such de-
vices present particularly attractive optical zeroth order
transmission. First, this one is higher than the simple
sum of individual holes contributions. Second it presents
an interesting pattern versus wavelength [1]. During the
last few years, several theoretical and experimental works
have tried to clarify processes involved in these phenom-
ena [1-9]. In this context, it has been pointed out that
surface plasmons (SPs) play a key role in the features
observed in the transmission curves [1-9].

More precisely, when the incident light illuminates the
array, many diﬀraction orders appear. Some of them,
which are evanescent, exhibit a resonant coupling with
SPs which give a contribution to the zeroth diﬀraction
order via multi-scattering. The strong exhaltation of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld related to the resonant processes
appears through the enhanced transmission [1-9]. In a
recent work [7] we have replaced the role of SPs in the
Ebbesen experiments through the concept of resonant
Wood anomalies [10]. We have shown that the transmis-
sion pattern is better described by Fano’s proﬁles corre-
lated with interferences between non resonant processes
and the resonant response of the eigen-modes coupled
with nonhomogeneous diﬀraction orders. Our study have
shown that each maximum of transmission (preceded by
a minimum) corresponds to one maximum of a Fano’s
proﬁle (preceded by the related minimum respectively)
[11]. Whereas such Fano’s proﬁle in transmission is re-
lated to a resonant process, the location of its maximum
(or minimum) does not necesserely correspond to the lo-
cation of the resonance [7]. Such results have been re-
cently underlined by Genet et al [8].

Paradoxically, reﬂection has not been as widely stud-
ied as transmission. To our knowledge, our work was
the ﬁrst to present theoretical reﬂection properties in the
case of hole array in chromium ﬁlms [7].
In the same
way, Altewischer et al were the ﬁrst to present experimen-

tal data on reﬂection which underline its non-reciprocal
properties [9]. As explained, reﬂection and transmission
are both necessary for a complete description and under-
standing of the optical system [7,9]. In the present paper,
we propose to investigate theoretically the device studied
by Altewischer et al [9].

In the following, our simulations rest on a coupled
modes method (which takes into account the periodic-
ity of the device permittivity) associated with the use
of the scattering matrix formalism [7]. A Li algorithm
is used to stabilize our computations [12]. In this way,
we calculate the amplitudes of the reﬂected and trans-
mitted ﬁeld, for each diﬀracted order (which correspond
to a vector g of the reciprocal lattice) according to their
polarization (s or p) [7].

Fig.1 shows the system under study. It is similar to
this used in experimental measurements [9]. One con-
siders a square grating (parameter a = 700 nm) made of
circular holes (radius equal to 100 nm) in a thin gold ﬁlm
(thickness equal to 200 nm) deposited on glass substrate
(refractive index is εs = 1.51 according to [9]). Polar-
ization is rectilinear along to the grating axis [1, 0]. The
gold permittivity is obtained from experimental tables
[13]. Numerically the substrate is semi-inﬁnite whereas
the experimental device was made of a ﬁnite thickness
glass substrate. In addition, the experimental device had
a very thin ﬁlm of titanium as bonding layer between
gold ﬁlm and substrate [9] which is not considered in our
calculations.

Fig.2a shows the zeroth order reﬂection against wave-
length according to the propagation of light, i.e.
from
vacuum toward substrate or vice versa (cf captions). We
have added the transmission for which the verticale scale
has been multiplied 5 times [9]. These results are in very
good agreements whith those obtain experimentally, de-
spite some simpliﬁcations in the modelization of the ex-
perimental device [9]. The wavelengths 757 nm (1′), 812
nm (2′) and 1146 nm (3′) denotes remarkable changes
in the reﬂection. Experimental data give 747 nm, 810
nm and just over 1100 nm [9]. In addition, it was shown
[9] that when light comes from vacuum-side, reﬂection
ranges from 76 % at 775 nm to 55 % at 810 nm, whereas
when it comes from glass-side, reﬂection ranges from 90
% to 40 %. Around 1100 nm, the reﬂection is about 70 %
when light comes from vacuum, and 23 % when it comes
from glass [9]. By comparison, we obtain the following
results numerically. When light comes from vacuum-side,
reﬂection ranges from 80 % at 775 nm to 42 % at 812 nm,

1

whereas when it comes from glass-side, reﬂection ranges
from 88 % to 45 %. For 1146 nm, the reﬂection is about
90 % when light comes from vacuum, and 50 % when it
comes from glass. These results show a very good agree-
ment between our calculated values and the experimental
data. Note also, the ﬁrst peak in transmission located to
610 nm. If we neglect coupling of surface plasmons be-
tween each interfaces, the resonance wavelengths related
to each resonant diﬀraction orders are given by [14]

resonant order (±2, 0) at substrate/metal interface for

sp
mission as the ﬁrst peak to 610 nm).

As observed in experiments, there is a signiﬁcant dif-
ference between the reﬂection spectra calculated when
light comes from glass side or vacuum side. On the con-
trary, such diﬀerence is not obtained in the transmis-
sion spectra. It is well known that transmission spectra
should be equal whereas it is not the case for reﬂection
spectra on account of reciprocity theorem [15]. Such dif-
ferences in reﬂection spectra enable to obtain additional
information on processes involved in these phenomena as
explained [9]. When light comes from vacuum, one ob-
serves two peaks at wavelength (1′) et (2′). On the con-
trary, when light come from glass side a stronger peak
appears at wavelength (3′) and peak (1′) almost disap-
pears. Altewischer et al [9] explained that these results
indicate that the resonances are essentially localized at
ﬁrst illuminated interface, and thus are more strongly vis-
ible in reﬂection than in transmission. In order to check
this interpretation, we have numerically computed the
amplitudes of main resonant orders against wavelength
depending on the ﬁrst illuminated interface. Fig. 2b
shows the amplitude of resonant orders (±1, 0) at the
substrate/metal interface. It is characterized by a peak
localised at wavelength (4) when light illuminates the
substrate/metal interface ﬁrst. Fig. 2b shows which
is the resonance wavelength calculated with eq.1. One
notes a second peak at wavelength (3′) close to (4), the
physical origin of which is not clear, but it could be re-
lated to interferences between the true resonance and
non-resonant processes such as a Fano resonance [7-8].
By contrast, when the vacuum/metal interface is illumi-

nated ﬁrst, the amplitude of the resonance collapses, in
agreement with what is obtained in reﬂection. Fig. 2c
shows resonant orders (±1, 0) at vacuum/metal interface.
Here, the resonance corresponds to wavelength (2). One
can easily locates the related peak. In addition, we show
the existence of two others peaks which correspond to
wavelength (1′) and (2′). As we will see, both peaks prob-
ably arise from the coupling between the order (±1, 0) at
vacuum/metal interface and the order (±1, ±1) at sub-
strate/metal interface. If the vacuum/metal interface is
ﬁrst illuminated, amplitudes of peaks (2) and (1′) are
stronger than if the substrate/metal interface is ﬁrst illu-
minated. This explains the diﬀerence between reﬂection
spectra for wavelength close to (1′). Moreover, the peak
close to wavelength (2′), in the resonant order amplitude,
does not signiﬁcantly change, leading to a weak diﬀerence
in reﬂection spectra according to the illuminated side.
In ﬁg.2d we shows the amplitude of order (±1, ±1) at
substrate/metal interface. The corresponding resonance
wavelength is noted (3). As this latter interface is illu-
minated ﬁrst, the amplitude is maximum contrary to the
opposite case (vacuum/metal interface illuminated ﬁrst).
The fact that the orders (±1, ±1) at substrate/metal in-
terface and (±1, 0) at vacuum/metal interface, have res-
onance wavelengths close, implies change in their ampli-
tudes. Indeed, the amplitude proﬁle of order (±1, 0) at
vacuum/metal interface, just after wavelength (2), can
be understood as a Fano proﬁl. Such a Fano resonance
can be interpreted as resulting from the interference be-
tween the resonance of order (±1, 0) at vacuum/metal
interface only, and the resonance of order (±1, ±1) at
substrate/metal interface which appears then via mul-
tiscattering of (±1, 0) into (±1, ±1). This explains, for
instance, why wavelength (1′) and (2′) do not correspond
exactly to the resonance wavelength of the diﬀerents res-
onant orders. Fano proﬁles resulting from interferences
between each orders via multiscattering lead to resonance
wavelength shift [7-8]. We note that these results con-
cerning the behavior of resonant orders amplitudes in
relation to reﬂection, are in agreement with the interpre-
tation of Altewischer et al [9]. In addition to transmission
and reﬂection, it can be useful to specify the loss against
wavelength according to the illuminated side. This is
shown in ﬁg.3. As light comes from vacuum side, we ob-
serve two sharp peaks at wavelength (1′) and (2′). Such
peaks correspond to the resonance mentionned above. In
the opposite, when light comes from glass side, ﬁrst peak
collapses, whereas another large double peak appears at
wavelength (3′), again in agreement with resonance be-
havior. So, each loss peak corresponds to a surface plas-
mon resonance. In both cases, the loss spectra pattern
can be easily compared with reﬂection spectra pattern.
These features indicate that, when surface plasmons are
excited, a large part of their energy is dissipated via
In
Joule eﬀect, leading to lower reﬂection intensities.
addition, a smaller part of surface plasmon energy is re-
turned in transmitted energy via multiscattering. So, as
surface plasmon are essentially excited on the interface il-

luminated ﬁrst, their related high losses obviously model
reﬂection feature according to the propagation of light.
It is quite diﬀerent for transmission. Surface plasmons
of both interfaces contribute to enhanced transmission
with almost same magnitude whatever the ﬁrst illumi-
nated side. If one interface is illuminated, it is charac-
terized by strong surface plasmons resonances. But such
resonances give a weak contribution to the transmission
in relation to their intensities as they must propagate
through the holes before to give transmitted propaga-
tive ﬁeld. Indeed, the light is strongly damped when it
propagates through the holes. Surface plasmons on the
opposite interface are excited by incident light after its
propagation through the holes. So, as its intensity is
strongly damped too, surface plasmons on the opposite
interface are weakly excited. So, their contribution to
the transmitted ﬁeld is weak consequently. In brief, sur-
face plasmons of the illuminated interface are strongly
excited and then damped after propagation through the
holes, whereas surface plasmons on the opposite inter-
face are weakly excited as the incident light is damped
after propagation through the hole. In this way, as sur-
face plasmons on the illuminated interface and incident
light are damped in the same way when they propagate
through the holes, surface plasmons of both interface con-
tribute to transmission with the same magnitude. So, in
this way, the choice of the illuminated side has no signi-
ﬁcative role on the transmission pattern.

In conclusion, modeling a system similar to that used
in experimental works [9], we have shown that numerical
simulations give results in good qualitative and quanti-
tative agreement with experiments [9]. In particular, we
have simulated the reﬂection spectra and found that their
disymmetry, according to the propagation of light, is ef-
fectively caused by the localization of resonances at ﬁrst
illuminated interface as it was suggested by Altewischer
et al [9].

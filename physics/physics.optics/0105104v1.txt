Abstract

The evolution of the transverse momentum of monochromatic light entering
a multimode planar waveguide at large angle is investigated. We report on
oscillations of the momentum caused by the beatings between the adjacent
populated modes of the waveguide and their periodic collapses and revivals.
A new type of an interferometer based on this eﬀect with fringe spacing as
small as λ/9 is demonstrated experimentally and periods as small as λ/1000
seem to be feasible.

The propagation of light along a planar multimode waveguide is one of the fundamen-
tal questions of wave optics. This problem is closely related to the evolution of atomic
wavepackets in square potential wells [1]. As it was shown in [2], [3] it is also related to
the propagation of light in a periodic grating. The situation, when the monochromatic light
enters the waveguide with no average transverse momentum, was studied in [3], [4].

This letter considers the case, when the monochromatic light beam enters the planar
metal multimode waveguide at some large angle. In this case the light experiences not only
full and fractional revivals [3] of its initial phase distribution along the waveguide, but also
additional oscillations of the transverse momentum. This is related to the beatings between
the adjacent populated transverse modes of the waveguide. These oscillations are similar
to the Pendell¨osung oscillations [5] for the Bragg reﬂection of waves at diﬀraction gratings,
which were observed in many diﬀerent systems [6], [7].

Based on this eﬀect, a new type of interferometer with a fringe spacing much smaller

than the wavelength of light has been demonstrated.

The basic setup is shown in Fig. 1. The waveguide is realized by two metal mirrors
placed parallel to each other at distance d. The plane monochromatic light wave enters the
waveguide at an angle β. The amplitude of the transverse distribution of the light ﬁeld at
the front of the waveguide is E0(x, y < 0) = E0 exp (−ik sin (β) x) exp (−ik cos (β) y), where
k = 2π/λ and λ is the wavelength of the light. Therefore, the initial distribution has a
constant amplitude and its phase changes linearly in x direction. The modes propagating
along the waveguide have to satisfy the condition of quantization of the transverse component
of their wavevector

kd sin αn = nπ,

(1)

where n=1,2,3... and αn is the angle of the wavevector in the n-th mode with respect to the
boundaries of the guide. The ﬁeld amplitude inside the waveguide is given by

The exponents give the phase and the loss of the n-th mode along the waveguide and
sin (nπx/d) - is the distribution of the light amplitude in the n-th mode. The coeﬃcients cn

The numerical calculations of the light momentum distribution at the output of the
waveguide based on equations (2-4) show quasi-periodic oscillations between the two main
directions β and −β (see Fig. 1) as a function of the length L of the waveguide. We shall
label these two output beams respectively as transmitted and reﬂected beams. For incidence
angles β > arcsin (λ/d) the two output beams are well separated from each other in momen-
tum. The solid curve in Fig. 2 shows the calculated intensity of the transmitted light beam
as a function of the waveguide length L. In these calculations we assumed large width of
the waveguide d >> λ and small angles of incidence sin (β) << 1. We used a dimensionless
relative length s = L/Lr, corresponding to the number of revival, or Talbot, or self imaging
periods [3]

and a constant propagation parameter f = 48,

which is equal to the ratio of the revival period Lr to the period of light momentum beatings

This is related to the situation when the waveguide width d is ﬁxed and its length L is
varied. For this setting there are only a few transverse modes of the waveguide signiﬁcantly
populated, which satisfy the condition αe
n ≃ β. The length Lb corresponds to the period of
beatings between these modes. The expression (7) is valid only for d >> λ and sin (β) << 1,
which is the case for our experiment. Without this assumption the period of the beatings
between two adjacent modes is

Note that the period (7) can be found also from a zigzag geometrical ray propagation of
the ingoing light beam through the waveguide. The corresponding classical oscillations of
the intensity in the transmitted beam are shown in Fig. 2 by the dashed sinusoidal trace
possessing a period Lb. However these classical oscillations do not depend on the light
wavelength.

The real wave behavior (solid curve) is quite diﬀerent and can be characterized by two
main periods Lr and Lb. Despite the fact, that the period of the momentum beatings is
approximately the same as in the classical case, the location of the peaks is determined
by the position of revival resonances [3] and therefore depends on the wavelength of light.
The amplitude of the beatings is modulated in such a way that they are maximal around
the relative lengths of the waveguide smax
m = 1/4 + m/2,
with m = 0, 1, 2.... It means the revivals and collapses of momentum state oscillations take
place. For full revival lengths, when m is even and smax
m = 0, 1, 2..., the revivals of the initial
light momentum take place and all light is concentrated in the transmitted output beam.

m = m/2 and minimal around smin

For half-revival lengths, when m is even and smax
m = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2..., the phase of the initial
momentum distribution is inverted and all light is concentrated in the reﬂected beam. It
can be seen from Fig. 2 that the phase of momentum oscillations at s = 1/2 is inverted
with respect to their phase at s = 0, which is not the case for classical oscillations. From
equations (5-7) it follows that the tuning of the waveguide from one transmission fringe to
the next can be done by changing either the length or the width of the waveguide, or the
light wavelength according to

One way to change the relative length s of the waveguide is to vary the width d, while
the length of the waveguide L ﬁxed. As s = Lλ/8d2 is nonlinear in d, the fringe spacing δd
also changes nonlinearly in d as

The maximum amplitudes of the momentum oscillations are located at half and full revival
distances, which are characterized by the following widths of the waveguide

where m is an integer.

Compared to all other types of interferometers, where the minimal fringe spacing is
equal to λ/2, the distance δd can be much smaller than the light wavelength. This can
be explained by the fact, that in a waveguide the interfering modes experience multiple
reﬂections between the mirrors before their phase diﬀerence is observed.

Experimentally the waveguide was formed by two parallel ﬂat mirrors of equal length
(L = 5 cm), coated with bare gold. The substrates were made of fused silica and polished to
a surface ﬁgure ∽ λ/20. All degrees of freedom of one of the mirrors were adjustable. This
mirror was attached to a precise mechanical translational stage driven by a ”COHERENT”
Encoder Driver System 37-0486 which provided a resolution in translation of ∽ 10 nm and
a total range of 13 mm in the x direction.

We used a He-Ne laser with wavelength λ = 633 nm, divergence about 1 mrad, linear
polarisation, directed parallel to the mirrors, and a beam diameter of ≃ 2 mm. In our ﬁrst
experiment the entrance edge of the waveguide was illuminated at an angle of β = 0.253
rad.

To detect the oscillations we used a photodiode, which was placed in the reﬂected output
light beam (Fig. 1) at a distance D ≃ 10 cm behind the waveguide. Each measurement of
the light intensity in the reﬂected beam as a function of the waveguide width d was done
in a single sweep of the driven mirror. The corresponding dependencies are shown in Fig. 3.
We have observed quasi-periodic oscillations of the light intensity in the reﬂected and the
transmitted output light beam, shifted by π with respect to each other. This leads to the
conclusion, that the output light momentum experiences quasi-periodic oscillations between

4

the two directions β and −β. Fig. 3 also shows that these oscillations experience quasi-
periodic collapses and revivals as a function of distance d. In full agreement with equation
(10) the maximum amplitudes of the oscillations were observed at d1 ≃ 89µm, d2 ≃ 63µm,
d3 ≃ 51.5µm, d4 ≃ 44.5µm, d5 ≃ 40µm, d6 ≃ 36µm, d7 ≃ 33.5µm, d8 ≃ 31.5µm and
d9 ≃ 29.7µm, where half or full revivals take place.

The amplitude of the fringes become smaller with decreasing the width d of the waveg-
uide, which has several reasons. First, by extinction of the total light power coupled to the
waveguide; second, by increasing the number of reﬂections inside the waveguide and the cor-
responding losses; third, for smaller width of the waveguide the divergence of the outgoing
light beams becomes larger and the intensity decreases. The period of fringes is decreasing
with reducing the width d of the waveguide in full accordance with equation (9). For m = 9
(d ≃ 30µm) we have observed fringes with a period δd ≃ 70 nm. These fringes are shown in
the inset of Fig. 3c. For such a small fringe spacing the single steps of the Encoder Driver,
which are of the order of 10 nm, were resolved.

To observe directly the oscillations of the output light between the two directions β
and −β we used a CCD camera placed at distance D ≃ 12 cm behind the waveguide,
which detected the transmitted and reﬂected output beams simultaneously. The detected
transverse spatial distribution of light around the m = 1 revival resonance are presented in
the left column of Fig. 4. The right column of the Fig. 4 shows corresponding momentum
distributions calculated numerically from equations (2), (3) and (4).

According to the equation (10) the position of fringes depends on the light wavelength.
To demonstrate this fact experimentally, we have illuminated the waveguide with two co-
propagating and well overlapped laser beams of diﬀerent frequency (λ1 = 633 nm and
λ2 = 532 nm). For the latter wavelength we used a frequency-doubled Nd:Vanadate single-
frequency laser. At large widths d of the waveguide the outgoing light distributions are
identical for both frequencies, but for small d, the fringes are shifted with respect to each
other. As an example Fig. 4c shows spatial distributions of the output light at width d =
86µm. Under these conditions the red light intensity (λ1 = 633 nm) is almost completely
contained in the transmitted beam and the green light (λ2 = 532 nm) in the reﬂected one.
Therefore the two diﬀerent frequency components are well separated in momentum and
space.

From all these observations we come to the conclusion, that the multimode waveguide
at large incidence angles of the input light beam can be considered as a new kind of an
interferometer. The deﬁnite advantage of such an interferometer, compared to other known
types, like Fabry-Perot or Michelson interferometers, is that its fringe spacing (5) can be
much smaller than λ/2. The observed period of λ/9 was soley limited by technical factors
in our ﬁrst experiment. For a very narrow waveguide (d ∼ λ) the period of revivals and
mode beatings become smaller than in the multimode waveguide considered above (d >> λ).
Especially interesting is the limit, when the waveguide contains only two propagating modes.
The fringes of such a waveguide becomes uniform and periodic, and their period can be
calculated from the formula (8), where n = 1 should be used. The fringe spacing of such
an interferometer is expected to be very small. For example in a case of a waveguide with
d = 0.7 µm, L = 100 µm, λ = 633 nm and β = 33◦, the fringe spacing is expected to be
δd = 0.56 nm.

Such a new kind of interferometer, especially in dielectric multimode waveguides, can ﬁnd

5

many applications in precision optical measurements and also in switching and modulation
of optical signals.

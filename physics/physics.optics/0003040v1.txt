Abstract

The sensitivity of the displacement transducer pumped with a train of high-intensity
laser pulses is estimated. Due to the multicomponent character of the pump a consid-
eration of transformations of the signal and the noises between optical modes plays an
important role in estimation of the potential sensitivity. An expression for the mini-
mal detectable external classical force resembles those for the continuous wave pumping
with substitution of the laser power by a time averaged power of pulsed laser. Possible
scheme for back action noise compensation for such transducers is considered. For full
suppression of back action noise the ﬁeld of local oscillator has to be pulsed with the
same time dependence as the pump ﬁeld.

1 Introduction

The longbase laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors are under construction at
present time [1-3]. Their sensitivity to metric perturbation will be about h ≈ 10−21 that cor-
responds to the classical regime of operation. However for future installations with projected
sensitivity 10−22 ÷ 10−23 the quantum features of the measurement process can play a signif-
icant role. At the same time there are no limits of principle on the accuracy of measurement
of external classical force. Therefore the methods and schemes which give the possibility to
overcome the quantum measurement limitations (or the so called standard quantum limit,
SQL) is of vital importance for future generation of gravitational wave experiments.

There are several procedures which allow to achieve the sensitivity larger than the SQL
[4,5]. For example in [5] an optimal ﬁltration procedure for the simplest variant of the
optical sensor - a mirror attached to a mechanical resonator and illuminated with a coherent
pump ﬁeld - was considered. An external force acting on the mechanical oscillator displaces
its equilibrium position and thus changes the phase of the reﬂected ﬁeld. The vacuum
ﬂuctuations of the input light act on the oscillator through the radiation pressure eﬀect
and constitute the back action noise of the measuring apparatus. For such system two
quadratures of reﬂected wave are correlated. Using correlation (phase sensitive) processing
of two quadratures one can increase a signal-to-noise ratio and overcome the SQL.

However the gain in sensitivity for the schemes overcoming the SQL is usually propor-
tional to the square root of the ratio of laser power used for pumping the interferometer and
an optimal power that corresponds to the point where the sensitivity of the interferometer
achieve the SQL [4-6]. Unfortunately the optimal power is impracticably large, about several
dozens of kilowatts that restrains the experimental implementation of the technique.

The pumping with the ultrashort periodic laser pulses can be technically advantageous
over a continuous wave pumping for practical realization of the schemes overcoming the SQL.
Actually for a large power a problem of generating a train of short high-intensity laser pulses
can be technically easier than a problem of cw light generation (when the averaged powers
for two cases are equal) because in the ﬁrst case the energy in laser resonator is spread over
the large frequency band (and diﬀerent spatial longitudinal modes) and high intensities can
be produced relatively easily. At the same time the amplitude and frequency stability of
the pulsed pump in the case of a mode locked laser can be at the same level as for the
monochromatic pump [7,8]. For example in [8] the stability of intermode beats for the mode
locked laser output was estimated as 5 · 10−12 in 10 s.

Another consideration is that the perspectives of squeezed states generation with high
nonclassicality seem more realistic for the case of short high-intensity laser pulses allowing
the use of squeezed pulsed pump in displacement transducers [9].

Finally an analog to digital conversion is usually used in modern experiment during the
processing of the output. Therefore it seems natural to take the pulsed pump at once so
that the output will comprise a set of the values for appropriate variable at deﬁnite times.
The goals of this article are to consider a displacement transducer consisting of a mirror
attached to a mechanical oscillator and illuminated with a train of high-intensity laser pulses,
to reveal the algorithm of optimal signal processing for such transducer and to estimate the
sensitivity of the scheme to a measurement of classical external force.

The model of displacement transducer and basic equations of motion is considered in
section 2. The sensitivities for traditional measurement scheme and for correlative processing
of the output quadratures in the case of time independent pump are estimated in sections
3 and 4 correspondingly. The pulsed pump for the displacement transducer is considered in
section 5. The conclusions are in section 6.

2 Model for displacement transducer and transforma-

tion of quadrature components

Let consider the most simple case of optical displacement transducer - a mirror attached to
a mass of a mechanical oscillator and illuminated with a train of high-intensity laser pulses.
An external force displaces an equilibrium position of mechanical oscillator changing the
phase of reﬂected wave. The variation of the reﬂected ﬁeld phase is measured by a readout
system. This model is easy to calculate and it contains at the same time all features of
displacement transducers with pulsed pump. For the incident Ei and reﬂected Er waves one
can use the quasimonochromatic approximation

Ei = (A(t − x/c) + a1) · cos ωp(t − x/c) − a2 · sin ωp(t − x/c)
Er = (B(t + x/c) + b1) · cos ωp(t + x/c) − b2 · sin ωp(t + x/c)

(1)

where A(t − x/c) and ωp are an amplitude (mean value) and a frequency of the pump wave,
a1 and a2 are the operators of the quadrature components (ﬂuctuations) of the pump wave
(vacuum for coherent state), B(t+x/c) is an amplitude (mean value) of the reﬂected wave, b1

2

and b2 are the operators of the quadrature components (ﬂuctuations) of the reﬂected wave.
The periodic envelope function A(t−x/c) consists of a train of equally spaced pulses and the
duration of each pulse is considerably larger than the period of light wave but considerably
smaller than the period of the mechanical oscillator.

To obtain the equation coupling the amplitudes of the incident and reﬂected waves for
the moving mirror one can use a transformation of electromagnetic ﬁeld for moving reference
frame [10]. For a constant velocity of the mirror V one has

Er = −[(1 − V /c)/(1 + V /c)] · Ei exp(−2iωpX/c)

(2)

where for simplicity the reﬂection coeﬃcient of the mirror is taken to be r ≈ −1 and X is the
position of the mirror. Let suppose that this expression is valid also for the slowly varying
velocity V (t) and position X(t) of the mirror and | V (t) |≪ c (the validity of equation (2)
has been proved for the mirror consisting of free electrons for the general case of relativistic
velocity V (t) in [11]). Then in linear approximation in V /c one can obtain from equation
(2) the following expression

Er = −(1 − 2V (t)/c − 2iωpX(t)/c) · Ei

(3)

The ﬁrst term in (3) is an amplitude modulation of the reﬂected wave due to the mirror
movement and the second is a phase modulation. For slow motion of the mirror V ≈ ωµX
(ωµ is a frequency of mechanical oscillator) and the second term in brackets is considerably
smaller than the third term. Therefore for the transformation of the quadrature components
of the ﬁeld one can obtain

b1(t) = −a1(t)
b2(t) = −a2(t) + 2ωpA(t)X(t)/c

For the equation of mirror motion one has

¨X(t) + 2δµ

˙X(t) + ω2

µX(t) = M −1(Fs(t) + Fp(t) + Fth(t))

(4)

(5)

where M and δµ are the mass and the damping coeﬃcient of mechanical oscillator, Fs(t) is a
signal force, Fp(t) is radiation pressure force and Fth(t) is a force associated with the damping
of the oscillator. Let suppose for simplisity that δµ tends to zero. Then the displacement
X(t) of the mirror will consist of two parts - a signal displacement Xs(t) and a radiation
pressure displacement Xp(t). For Fp(t) one has

where S is a cross section of the laser beam. Therefore the equations of motion for the
displacement transducer are

Fp(t) = SA(t) · a1(t)/(4π)

(6)

b1(t) = −a1(t)
b2(t) = −a2(t) + 2ωpA(t)X(t)/c
¨X(t) + 2δµ ˙X(t) + ω2

µX(t) = M −1(Fs(t) + SA(t) · a1(t)/(4π))

Sensitivity for a traditional measurement scheme

For traditional measurement scheme [4,6] the amplitude of the pump is constant. There-
fore one can easily obtain the transformation relations for the quadratures b1 and b2 from
equations (7)

b1(ω) = −a1(ω)
b2(ω) = −a2(ω) + λξ(ω)A2a1(ω) + Aξ(ω)Fs(ω)

(8)

where ξ(ω) = 2ωpG(ω)/c, G(ω) = hM(−ω2 − 2δµiω + ω2
fer function and λ = S/(4π).

µ)i−1

is mechanical oscillator trans-

Only quadrature b2 contains the signal and it is this quadrature that is measured in
traditional measurement scheme [4,6]. This corresponds to the measurement of the phase of
the reﬂected wave. The ﬁrst term in the right hand side of equation (8) for b2 can be treated
as an additive noise and the second term as a back action noise. For small pump amplitudes
the sensitivity is increasing with the increase of A because the signal is proportional to A.
However for large pump amplitudes the second term in r.h.s. of (8) becomes dominant and
the sensitivity is decreasing with the increase of A. Therefore there is an optimal value of
the pump amplitude and the sensitivity to external force at this pump amplitude is just the
SQL [6].

4 Correlative processing of quadratures for time inde-

pendent amplitude of the pump

Two quadratures of the reﬂected ﬁeld according to equation (8) have the dependence on the
amplitude ﬂuctuations of the incident ﬁeld a1. Therefore one can expect that the sensitivity
can be increased for the correlative processing of the output [5,12]. Actually if one combine
with appropriate weight coeﬃcients the quadratures b1 and b2 of the output wave then in
this combination the noise term depending on a1 can be cancelled. This weighting can be
done by a homodyne detector with appropriate choise of a local oscillator phase φ.

Let the ﬁeld of the local oscillator have the form

Then the photodetector output is proportional to the following expression according to (1),
(9)

EL(t) = AL cos(ωpt + φ)

(9)

and at certain frequency ωf one can obtain

Ipd ∝ AL(b1 cos φ + b2 sin φ)

(10)

Ipd ∝ AL[a1(ωf)(− cos φ + λξ(ωf)A2 sin φ) − a2(ωf) sin φ + Aξ(ωf)Fs(ωf) sin φ]

(11)

Therefore choosing the phase φ according to the equation (ξ(ωf) is real for δµ = 0)

4

− cos φ + λξ(ωf)A2 sin φ = 0

(12)

one can make the photocurrent insensitive to the amplitude ﬂuctuations a1 of the input ﬁeld
at certain frequency ωf of the signal. In this case the increase of the pump amplitude A
results in the relative increase of the output signal at frequency ωf according to the equation
(11) with respect to the noise level deﬁned by a2.

For compensation of the back action noise inside deﬁnite frequency band one has to use
the time dependent local oscillator phase φ(t) [12,13]. In this case the optimal dependence of
φ on t is deﬁned by the displacement transducer transfer function ξ(ωf) and by the spectrum
of the external force Fs(ω) [12].

So a signal-to-noise ratio is proportional to A2 (there is no optimal power) and in principle
there is no sensitivity limitation by the SQL. In real experiment when the pump power gets
larger the output signal and noises get smaller according to equation (11) if the condition
(12) is kept valid therefore when A becomes greater than a certain value then the noises
of photodetector electronics can limit the sensitivity. However this noises have technical
character and will be neglected in the following.

Another sensitivity restriction can arise due to the damping in mechanical oscillator
(mirror) [14,15]. This problem is general for all supersensitive measurements. At the same
time an intrinsic dissipation obtained in modern experiments for mechanical oscillator is far
larger (by several orders of magnitude) than the value expected from the ﬁrst principles [16]
therefore it can be treated also as a technical problem now and will not be adressed below.
It is worth to mention that the increase in sensitivity over the usual measurement scheme
occurs here due to utilization of the internal squeezing (self-squeezing) of the reﬂected beam
because of the nonlinear (quadratic) interaction of the incident light and the mirror [17,18].
Actually two quadratures of the reﬂected beam are correlated and it is this fact that allow
to use the correlative processing of the output. On the other hand the correlation of the
quadratures according to equations (8) means the squeezing of the beam and the larger the
correlation coeﬃcient λξ(ω)A2 the larger the internal squeezing [17].

5 Sensitivity for the pulsed pump

Let consider the periodic envelope A(t) which consists of a train of equally spaced pulses
with duration τ and period T . The spectrum of this pump has also the form of a train of
pulses in frequency domain with the distance between neighbour pulses

For the amplitude of the pump A(t) one can use now the expansion into the Fourier series

ωq = 2πT −1

(13)

A(t) =

∞

Xn=−∞

gn exp(−inωqt)

(14)

and the particular form of A(t) is deﬁned by the set of Fourier amplitudes gn.

The response of the displacement transducer now have many frequency components at
ω = nωq, n = 0, 1 . . . according to the equations (4) and each frequency component contains

5

the signal part besides the radiation pressure force Fp(t) have also wide spectrum (cf. (6)).
So there are two problems: how to collect the signal parts from the whole spectral band of the
output and how to achieve the compensation of the radiation pressure noise in the output. It
is clear that the monochromatic local oscillator is inappropriate for the homodyning because
quadrature b1(t) of the output signal contains in this case the quadrature a1(t) of the input
noises only from one frequency and the radiation pressure force Fp(t) in expression for b2(t)
(cf. (7)) contains a1(t) from all frequencies nωq therefore the full compensation is impossible.
Fortunately two problems can be overcome by the use of the pulsed local oscillator with

the amplitude time dependence resembling that for the pump.

For the radiation pressure displacement Xp of the mechanical oscillator one has from

equations (5), (6) and (14) the following expression

Xp(ω) = G(ω)Fp(ω) = λG(ω)

∞

Xn=−∞

gna1(ω − nωq)

(15)

For the quadrature transformation one can obtain instead of (8) the following equations from
(4) and (14)

b1(ω) = −a1(ω)

b2(ω) = −a2(ω) + 2ωpc−1

∞

Xk=−∞

gk(Xp(ω − kωq) + Xs(ω − kωq))

(16)

Let suppose the local oscillator ﬁeld in the form of

EL(t) = AL(t) cos(ωpt + φ)

(17)

where the dependence of the amplitude AL(t) on t is much slower than cos ωpt. Then for the
envelope of the local oscillator ﬁeld AL(t) the Fourier expansion similar to (14) is valid

AL(t) =

∞

Xn=−∞

en exp(−inωqt)

The photodetector current has now the following form

and in the frequency domain one has

Ipd ∝ AL(t)(b1(t) cos φ + b2(t) sin φ)

consists of the additive noise and the back action noise and has the following expression
according to (15) and (16)

Let consider only the photocurrent at small frequencies ω ≈ ωµ. Then the main input
into the photocurrent will be given by the resonant terms for which k + n = 0. With this
supposition one has from equation (22)

[sin φ ·

Comparing equations (21) and (23) one can conclude that full compensation of back

action noise is possible only for

en = αgn

(24)

where α is the same for all numbers n so the forms of pump and local oscillator ﬁelds have
to be the same (apart from the scale factor α).

Let now consider the signal part of the second term in the r.h.s. of equation (20). From

equations (7), (16) and (20) one has

(26)

Combining equations (20), (23), (24) and (26) and supposing that the back action noise is
compensated in the output of the photodetector one can obtain for the spectral density of
noises in the photocurrent the following expression

N(ω) ∝ sin φ · N0 ·

∞

Xn=−∞

7

gng−n = sin φ · N0P

(27)

where it is supposed that ﬂuctuations at frequencies ω − nωq, n = 0, 1 . . . are uncorrelated
and have the same spectral density N0 (this assumption is valid for not very small duration
of pump pulses), P is proportional to the time averaged power of the pulsed pump. Then
for the signal-to-noise ratio µ one has from equations (26) and (27) the following expression

µ ∝ N −1

0 P Z ∞

−∞

| ξ(ω)Fs(ω) |2 dω

(28)

This value is just equal to the signal-to-noise ratio for continuous wave pump with a power
P and correlative processing of the output (cf. equation (11)). Note that the sensitivity here
is not limited by the SQL like in the case of correlative processing of quadratures for the
monochromatic pump and is increasing with the increase of P .

It is worth to mention that the condition for the back action noise compensation for
the pulsed pump is just the same as for the monochromatic pump (cf. equation (12)) with
substitution of the A2 with the time averaged value P . Therefore the compensation of the
back action noises for the ﬁnite frequency band can be possible for the time varying phase
of the local oscillator [12, 13].

6 Conclusion

The pumping of the displacement transducer with a train of the short high-intensity laser
pulses is considered. The algorithm of optimal signal processing for such transducer is re-
vealed. It consists of the correlative processing of the output using the pulsed local oscillator
with the same envelope as for the pump ﬁeld (apart from the scale factor).
In this case
the back action noise due to the radiation pressure force can be fully compensated and the
sensitivity of the scheme to a detection of a classical external force is not limited by the SQL
(as for the case of correlative quadrature processing and monochromatic pump ﬁeld).

The pulsed pump can be advantageous over the single frequency pumping when the non-
linear optical elements are used unside the system. Thus considerable increase in sensitivity
can be achieved for a gravitational interferometric Fabry-Perot type detector with a non-
linear optical element placed in a waist of the beam [19]. The use of the phase-conjugate
mirrors in a gravitational detector of the Michelson type allows to construct the system with
the parallel arms [20]. For such systems an eﬃciency depends on the instant power of the
light beam and can be high for the short intensive pulses.

In this article only the problem of the force detection with known spectrum is considered.
The reconstruction of unknown external force acting on the displacement transducer with
the pulsed pump below the standard quantum limit will be considered elsewhere.

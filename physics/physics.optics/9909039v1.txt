Abstract

An all optical set-reset ﬂip ﬂop is presented that is based on two coupled identical laser diodes. The lasers

are coupled so that when one of the lasers lases it quenches lasing in the other laser. The state of the ﬂip ﬂop is

determined by which laser is currently lasing. Rate equations are used to model the ﬂip ﬂop and obtain steady

state characteristics. The ﬂip ﬂop is experimentally demonstrated by use of antireﬂection coated laser diodes and

free space optics.

Introduction

Optical ﬂip ﬂops based on laser diodes (LD) have been extensively investigated as they have many potential applications

in optical computing and telecommunications. The most important types of optical bistable laser diode devices can

be classiﬁed into three broad types: 1) Absorptive bistability, 2) Two mode or polarization bistability by non-linear

gain saturation, 3) Dispersive bistability. A review and explanation of these three types of bistable LDs can be found

in [1].

The optical bistable system considered here is not based upon any of the above mentioned eﬀects and doesn’t rely

on second order laser eﬀects. Rather it is based on the fact that lasing at the natural lasing wavelength in a laser

can be quenched when suﬃcient external light is injected into the laser cavity. The external light is not coherent

with the lasing light. The external light is ampliﬁed by the laser gain medium. Lasing is quenched because the

ampliﬁed external light causes the gain inside the laser to drop below the lasing threshold (for the laser’s natural

lasing wavelength).

The concept of a bistable laser system based on gain quenching was ﬁrst envisioned in [2]. However two decades

passed before the concept was experimentally demonstrated in pulsed operation with dye lasers [3]. A theoretical

study of the system was presented in [4] and suggestions for implementation in laser diodes given. A bistable device

loosely based on the ideas presented in [2] was demonstrated in [5]. However this device was not based on coupled

separate lasing cavities and required saturable absorbers to change the lasing thresholds for the two lasing modes in

the system.

set-reset switching of the system.

In this paper we present for the ﬁrst time (to our knowledge) experimental results from a bistable system based on

the concept given in [2] operating continuously and employing laser diodes. Furthermore we demonstrate all optical

To introduce the rest of the paper, the concept presented in [2] and [4] is now elaborated in the context of the

experimental system described later. Two lasers can be coupled together as shown in Figure 1. Laser A’s lasing

wavelength is λ1 and only λ1 light from laser A is injected into laser B. Laser B’s lasing wavelength is λ2 and only λ2

light from laser B is injected into laser A. One laser acting as master can suppress lasing action in the other slave laser.

With a symmetric conﬁguration of the two lasers the role of master and slave can be interchanged. Thus the system

can be in one of two states, depending on which laser is lasing. The ﬂip ﬂop state can be determined by noting the

wavelength of the light output. The ﬂip ﬂop is in state 1 if light at wavelength λ1 is output, and state 2 if wavelength

λ2 is output.

in the new state.

To switch between states light from outside the ﬂip ﬂop can be injected into the laser that is currently master.

The master laser stops lasing at its natural wavelength due to the injected light. The absence of light from the master

laser allows the slave laser to start lasing and become master. When the external light is removed the ﬂip ﬂop remains

The ﬂip ﬂop described above is modeled and implemented here by using semiconductor optical ampliﬁers (SOA)

with wavelength dependent mirrors to form the LDs. This approach was taken because light injected into the LD

which is not at the lasing wavelength only passes once through the LD. Strict requirements such as the wavelength of

light injected into the LDs being at one of the LD resonant frequencies are thus avoided. However, implementations

based on LDs constructed in other ways are possible.

II. Rate Equations

The ﬂip ﬂop can be mathematically modeled using two coupled sets of rate equations (1) to (4). Each set describes one

of the LDs. In particular, the number (PA,PB) of photons in the laser cavity at the lasing wavelength are described

by one equation [(1) for LD A, (3) for LD B]. While the carrier number (NA,NB) in the laser cavity is described by

another equation [(2) for LD A, (4) for LD B].

The eﬀect of injected photons into the laser cavity is modeled by adding a carrier depletion term to the carrier

number rate equation [6], the S2av terms in (2) and (4). The S2av terms are taken from the SOA model presented

3

in [7]. In modeling the eﬀect of injected photons we have assumed the eﬀects of ampliﬁed spontaneous emission and

residual facet reﬂectivities are insigniﬁcant [7]. The rate equations are diﬀerent from those presented in [4] because

we base the rate equations on the SOA model of [7].

from one LD that are coupled into the other LD. Furthermore, from the right most terms of equations (2) and (4) it

can be seen that only λ1 wavelength photons (PA) from LD A are injected into LD B, and only λ2 wavelength photons

(PB) from LD B are injected into LD A.

τe is the carrier lifetime, and the other symbols have their usual meaning.

We consider the steady state behaviour of the ﬂip ﬂop. NA, NB, PA and PB can be considered state variables of

the ﬂip ﬂop, as the set of four variables describe a unique operating point of the ﬂip ﬂop. The state variable steady

state values were found by solving the rate equations numerically using a fourth order Runge-Kutta method. The

state variables were determined for various values of injected external light PBext starting at PBext = 0. PAext was set

to zero. For each value of PBext the state variables were found with the ﬂip ﬂop initially in state 1 and also initially

in state 2. The simulation parameters were: R1 = R2 = 0.02, η = 0.32, IA = IB = 158 mA, τe = 1 ns, q = 1.6 × 10−19

C, β = 5 × 10−5, νg = 8 × 109cm s−1, Γ = 0.33 , a = 2.9 × 10−16 cm−2, V = 2.5 × 10−10 cm3, N0 = 2.2 × 108,

αint = 27 cm−1, L = 500 microns. The SOA parameters were for a 1550 nm SOA [8].

The ﬂip ﬂop action can be clearly seen when the state variables PA and PB are plotted against PBext , Figure 2.

The wavelength of the PBext photons is not λ2. If the ﬂip ﬂop is initially in state 2, then it remains in state 2 with LD

B lasing until PBext reaches the level Pthr. At this point the ﬂip ﬂop abruptly changes to state 1 with LD A lasing.

The ﬂip ﬂop remains in state 1 even if PBext returns to zero. If the ﬂip ﬂop is initially in state 1 then it remains in

state 1 for all values of PBext . The behaviour of the ﬂip ﬂop is similar to that shown in Figure 2 when PBext is set

to zero and PAext is varied.

injected with external light.

It can be seen from the simulation results that the ﬂip ﬂop has some useful properties including: high contrast

ratio and little change in output at the lasing wavelength before the threshold is reached for the LD which isn’t being

5

III. Experiments

To demonstrate the operation of the ﬂip ﬂop a prototype was constructed in free space optics. LDs (Uniphase CQL806)

were used which had an antireﬂection coating with residual reﬂectivity of 5 × 10−4 deposited on the front facet. The

antireﬂection coated LDs function as SOAs. To form LDs as described in Section 1 and Section 2, diﬀraction gratings

were used as wavelength dependent mirrors for the antireﬂection coated LDs.

The experimental setup is shown in Figure 3. Gratings G1 and G2 form frequency selective external cavities

(that is, wavelength dependent mirrors) for the two LDs, forcing LD A to lase at λ1 = 684 nm and LD B to lase at

λ2 = 678.3 nm. The zeroth order diﬀracted beams from G1 and G2 serve as output beams for LD A and B. The

output beams pass through optical isolators and then gratings G3 and G4. This arrangement ensures that only λ1

light is injected into LD B from LD A, and only λ2 light is injected into LD A from LD B. The gratings G3 and G4

direct the appropriate wavelength of light to the photo-diodes. PD 1 detects optical power at wavelength λ1 and PD

2 at wavelength λ2. Beam splitters are used to allow injection of light from one LD to the other LD and also from an

external source. λ/2 plates are used to adjust the light polarization throughout the setup.

To demonstrate the ﬂip ﬂop operation, the ﬂip ﬂop state was regularly toggled by injecting light pulses into the

LD which was master in the current state. Two hundred microsecond wide pulses of light at wavelength 676.3 nm

were injected into the master LD for the current state approximately every 10 milliseconds. The optical powers at

wavelengths λ1 and λ2 were observed on an oscilloscope (via photo-diodes PD 1 and PD 2). The oscilloscope traces

are shown in Figure 4. The switching between states every 10 milliseconds can be clearly seen. Furthermore the ﬂip

ﬂop state is stable in the time between the state changes.

IV. Conclusion

An optical ﬂip ﬂop was proposed based on two simple lasers diodes which act as a master-slave pair. The two lasers

are coupled so that only light at the lasing wavelength of one laser is injected into the other laser. The ﬂip ﬂop state at

6

any given time is determined by which laser is master and which is slave. Rate equations were used to model the ﬂip

ﬂop. The steady state characteristics of the ﬂip ﬂop were obtained from the numerical solution of the rate equations.

Flip ﬂop operation is not dependent on second order laser eﬀects such as resonant frequency shifts or gain saturation.

Hence the ﬂip ﬂop should be able to be implemented in a wide variety of technologies. Furthermore the novel ﬂip ﬂop

structure is straightforward to implement.

The ﬂip ﬂop was experimentally demonstrated using laser diodes with antireﬂection coatings.

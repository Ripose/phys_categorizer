Frozen light in periodic metamaterials

Alex Figotin and Ilya Vitebskiy

Abstract. Wave propagation in spatially periodic media, such as photonic
crystals, can be qualitatively diﬀerent from any uniform substance.
The
diﬀerences are particularly pronounced when the electromagnetic wavelength is
comparable to the primitive translation of the periodic structure. In such a case,
the periodic medium cannot be assigned any meaningful refractive index. Still,
such features as negative refraction and/or opposite phase and group velocities
for certain directions of light propagation can be found in almost any photonic
crystal. The only reservation is that unlike hypothetical uniform left-handed
media, photonic crystals are essentially anisotropic at frequency range of interest.
Consider now a plane wave incident on a semi-inﬁnite photonic crystal. One can
assume, for instance, that in the case of positive refraction, the normal components
of the group and the phase velocities of the transmitted Bloch wave have the same
sign, while in the case of negative refraction, those components have opposite
signs. What happens if the normal component of the transmitted wave group
velocity vanishes? Let us call it a ”zero-refraction” case. At ﬁrst sight, zero
normal component of the transmitted wave group velocity implies total reﬂection
of the incident wave. But we demonstrate that total reﬂection is not the only
possibility. Instead, the transmitted wave can appear in the form of an abnormal
grazing mode with huge amplitude and nearly tangential group velocity. This
spectacular phenomenon is extremely sensitive to the frequency and direction of
propagation of the incident plane wave. These features can be very attractive
in numerous applications, such as higher harmonic generation and wave mixing,
light ampliﬁcation and lasing, highly eﬃcient superprizms, etc.

1. Introduction

such as photonic crystals,

is
Wave propagation in spatially periodic media,
qualitatively diﬀerent from that of any uniform substance. The diﬀerences are
particularly pronounced when the wavelength is comparable to the primitive
translation L of the periodic structure [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The eﬀects of strong spatial
dispersion culminate when the group velocity of a traveling Bloch wave vanishes. One
reason for this is that vanishing group velocity always implies a dramatic increase in
density of modes at the respective frequency. In addition, vanishing group velocity
also implies certain qualitative changes in the eigenmode structure, which can be
accompanied by some spectacular eﬀects in electromagnetic wave propagation. A
particular example of the kind is the frozen mode regime associated with a dramatic
enhancement of the wave transmitted to the periodic medium [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. In
this paper we consider several diﬀerent modiﬁcations of the frozen mode regime, each
related to a speciﬁc singularity of the electromagnetic dispersion relation. For every
case we present speciﬁc examples of periodic dielectric structures supporting such a
phenomenon. For the most part, we restrict ourselves to periodic layered media, which
are photonic crystals with one dimensional periodicity.

We start with the simple case of a plane electromagnetic wave normally incident
on a semi-inﬁnite periodic layered structure. In the case of normal incidence, there are
two diﬀerent kinds of frozen mode regime. The ﬁrst one is associated with a stationary
inﬂection point of the dispersion relation in Fig. 1(b).
In this case the incident
plane wave of frequency ω0 is converted into the frozen mode with inﬁnitesimal group
velocity and very large diverging amplitude. A detailed description of this phenomenon
can be found in our previous publications on this subject [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].
Qualitatively diﬀerent kind of frozen mode regime occurs in the vicinity of a degenerate
photonic band edge, shown in Fig. 1(c).
In this latter case, the incident wave of
frequency ωd is reﬂected back to space, but not before it creates a frozen mode with
huge diverging amplitude. Not every periodic structure can support the frozen mode
regime. Speciﬁcally, in the case of a normal incident, a unit cell of the periodic layered
array must contain at least three layers, of which two must display a misaligned in-
plane anisotropy, as shown in Fig. 2.
In photonic crystals with three dimensional
periodicity, the presence of anisotropic constitutive component is not necessary.

In Section 3, we turn to the case of oblique wave propagation, which is of
particular interest here. The frozen mode regime at oblique incidence can occur
when the normal component of the transmitted wave group velocity vanishes, while
its tangential component remains ﬁnite. In such a case, the transmitted wave is an
abnormal grazing mode with a dramatically enhanced amplitude and nearly tangential
energy ﬂux. Remarkably, the photonic crystal reﬂectivity at this point can be very
low, implying almost total conversion of the incident plane wave into the abnormal
grazing mode. A signiﬁcant advantage of this phenomenon is that it can occur in much
simpler periodic structures, compared to those supporting the frozen mode regime at
normal incidence. Examples are shown in Fig. 3 and 4. The presence of anisotropic
layers is still required.

Yet another interesting modiﬁcation of the frozen mode regime is an abnormal
subsurface wave in the vicinity of a degenerate photonic band edge. A regular
surface wave usually decays exponentially with the distance from the surface in either
direction. By contrast, the abnormal subsurface wave is extremely asymmetric. It
does decay rapidly outside the photonic crystal. But inside the periodic medium, its

Frozen light in periodic metamaterials

amplitude sharply increases, and reaches its maximum at a certain distance from the
surface. Only after that the ﬁeld amplitude begins a slow decay, as the distance from
the surface further increases. The proﬁle of such a subsurface wave is similar to that
of the frozen mode in the vicinity of a degenerate band edge. This phenomenon is
brieﬂy discussed in section 4.

from 0 and π/2.

2. Frozen mode regime at normal incidence

The essence of the frozen mode regime can be understood from the example of a plane
monochromatic wave normally incident on a semi-inﬁnite periodic layered structure,
as shown in Fig. 5. An important requirement, though, is that some of the layers

must display a misaligned in-plane anisotropy. The simplest periodic layered array of
the kind is shown in Fig. 2.

To start with, let us introduce some basic notations and deﬁnitions. Let ΨI ,
ΨR, and ΨT be the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves, respectively. Assume
for now that all three monochromatic waves propagate along the z axis normal to
the boundary of semi-inﬁnite periodic layered structure in Figs. 5. The photonic
crystal boundary is located at z = 0. Electromagnetic ﬁeld both inside (at z > 0) and
outside (at z < 0) the periodic stack is independent of the x and y coordinates, and

~E (z) ⊥ z, ~H (z) ⊥ z.

where ~E (z) and ~H (z) are time-harmonic electric and magnetic ﬁelds. We also assume
that anisotropic layers of the periodic array have in-plane anisotropy, so the ﬁelds ~E (z)
and ~H (z) are normal to the direction of propagation

All four transverse ﬁeld components in (1) are continuous functions of z, which leads
to the following standard boundary condition at z = 0

ΨT (0) = ΨI (0) + ΨR (0) .

Note that the polarizations of the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves can
be diﬀerent, because some of the layers of the periodic array display an in-plane
anisotropy, as shown in the example in Fig. 2. The latter is essential for the possibility
of the frozen mode regime.

In periodic layered media, the electromagnetic eigenmodes Ψk (z) are usually

chosen in the Bloch form

Ψk (z + L) = eikLΨk (z) ,

where the Bloch wavenumber k is deﬁned up to a multiple of 2π/L.
The
correspondence between ω and k is referred to as the Bloch dispersion relation. Real
k correspond to propagating (traveling) Bloch modes. Propagating modes belong to
diﬀerent spectral branches ω (k) separated by frequency gaps. The speed of a traveling
wave in periodic medium is determined by the group velocity [4]

u = dω/dk.

Normally, each spectral branch ω (k) develops stationary points ωs = ω (ks) where the
group velocity (5) of the corresponding propagating mode vanishes

dω/dk = 0, at ω = ωs = ω (ks) .

Examples of diﬀerent stationary points are shown in Fig.
1, where each of the
frequencies ωg, ω0 and ωd is associated with zero group velocity of the respective
traveling wave. Stationary points (5) play essential role in the formation of frozen
mode regime.

By contrast, evanescent Bloch modes are characterized by complex wavenumbers
k = k′ + ik′′. Evanescent modes decay exponentially with the distance z from the
boundary of semi-inﬁnite periodic structure. Therefore, under normal circumstances,
evanescent contribution to the transmitted wave ΨT (z) can be signiﬁcant only in close
proximity of the surface. The situation can change dramatically when the frequency ω
approaches one of the stationary point values ωs. At ﬁrst sight, stationary points (6)
relate only to propagating Bloch modes. But in fact, in the vicinity of every stationary
point frequency ωs, the imaginary part k′′ of the Bloch wavenumber of at least one of

Frozen light in periodic metamaterials

the evanescent modes also vanishes. As a consequence, the respective evanescent mode
decays very slowly, and its role may extend far beyond the photonic crystal boundary.
In addition, in the special cases of interest, the electromagnetic ﬁeld distributionΨ (z)
in the coexisting evanescent and propagating eigenmodes becomes very similar, as ω
approaches ωs. This can result in spectacular resonance eﬀects, such as the frozen
mode regime. What exactly happens in the vicinity of a particular stationary point
(6) essentially depends on its character and appears to be very diﬀerent in each of the
three cases presented in Fig. 1. In the next subsection we present a simple qualitative
picture of the frozen mode regime based on energy conservation consideration. Then,
in the following subsection, we provide more consistent analysis of the phenomenon.

subscripts I, R, and T refer to the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves,
respectively. In all cases, the amplitude of the incident wave is unity.

2.1. Energy density and energy ﬂux at frozen mode regime

Let SI , SR and ST be the energy ﬂux in the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves
in Fig. 5. The transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients of a lossless semi-inﬁnite medium
are deﬁned as

where

τ =

SI + SR = ST , ρ = 1 − τ .

With certain reservations, the energy ﬂux ST of the transmitted travelling wave can
be expressed as

(7)

(8)

where u is the group velocity, which is also the energy velocity, and WT is the energy
density

ST = WT u,

WT ∝ |ΨT |2 .

Frozen light in periodic metamaterials

Evanescent modes do not contribute to the normal energy ﬂux ST in the case of
a lossless semi-inﬁnite periodic structure. Besides, evanescent contribution to the
transmitted wave becomes negligible at a certain distance z from the surface. The
simple expression (8) may not apply when the transmitted wave involves two or more
propagating Bloch modes, but we will not deal with such a situation here.

Vanishing group velocity u in (8) implies that the transmitted wave energy ﬂux
ST also vanishes, along with the respective transmission coeﬃcient τ in (7). The
only exception could be if the energy density WT of the transmitted wave increases
dramatically in the vicinity of stationary point frequency. In other words, if WT in
(8) grows fast enough, as ω approaches ωs, the product WT u in (8) can remain ﬁnite
even at ω = ωs. In such a case, a signiﬁcant fraction of the incident radiation can
be converted into the slow mode inside the semi-inﬁnite periodic array. Hereinafter,
the eﬀect of a dramatic growth of the transmitted wave amplitude in the vicinity of
a stationary point (6) will be referred to as the frozen mode regime. The possibility
of such an eﬀect is directly related to the character of a particular stationary point.
From this point of view, let us consider three diﬀerent situation presented in Fig. 1.

2.1.1. Regular band edge We start with the simplest case of a regular photonic band
edge (RBE) shown in Fig. 1(a). It can be found in any periodic array, including any
periodic layered structure. Just below the band edge frequency ωg, the dispersion
relation can be approximated by a quadratic parabola

ωg − ω ∝ (k − kg)2 , at ω / ωg.

This yields the following frequency dependence of the propagating mode group velocity
u below the photonic band edge

u =

dω
dk

∝ (kg − k) ∝ (ωg − ω)1/2 , at ω / ωg.

Due to the boundary condition (3), the amplitude of the transmitted propagating
Bloch mode in this case remains ﬁnite and comparable to that of the incident wave.
Therefore, the energy ﬂux (8) associated with the transmitted slow mode vanishes, as
ω approaches ωg

(9)

(10)

(11)

ST = WT u ∝

(ωg − ω)1/2 , at ω / ωg
0, at ω ≥ ωg

(cid:26)

.

Formula (11) expresses the well-known fact that in the vicinity of a regular band edge,
a lossless semi-inﬁnite photonic crystal becomes totally reﬂective.

2.1.2. Stationary inﬂection point A completely diﬀerent situation occurs in the
vicinity of a stationary inﬂection point (SIP) shown in Fig. 1(b). Such a point can be
found in periodic layered structures involving anisotropic and magnetic layers [8, 9], as
well as in some photonic crystals with 2- and 3-dimensional periodicity. In the vicinity
of a stationary inﬂection point ω0, the dispersion relation can be approximated by a
cubic parabola

ω − ω0 ∝ (k − k0)3 .
The propagating mode group velocity u vanishes as ω approaches ω0 from either
direction

(12)

u =

dω
dk

∝ (k − k0)2 ∝ (ω − ω0)2/3 .

(13)

Frozen light in periodic metamaterials

But remarkably, the amplitude of the transmitted propagating mode increases so that
the respective energy density WT diverges as ω → ω0
−2/3 .

WT ∝ (ω − ω0)

(14)

The expression (13) together with (14) yield that the energy ﬂux of the transmitted
slow mode remains ﬁnite even at ω = ω0

ST = WT u ∼ SI , at ω ≈ ω0.

(15)

The latter implies that the incident light is converted to the frozen mode with
inﬁnitesimal group velocity (13) and huge diverging amplitude (14). Of course, in
reality, the amplitude of the frozen mode will be limited by such factors as absorption,
nonlinear eﬀects, imperfection of the periodic dielectric array, deviation of the incident
radiation from a perfect plane monochromatic wave, ﬁniteness of the photonic crystal
dimensions, etc. Still, with all these limitations in place, the frozen mode regime can
be very attractive for a variety of practical applications.

2.1.3. Degenerate band edge Let us turn to the case of a degenerate band edge (DBE)
shown in Fig. 1(c). Such a point can be found in dispersion relation of periodic layered
structures involving misaligned anisotropic layers. An example is shown in Fig. 2.
Just below the degenerate band edge frequency ωd, the dispersion relation ω (k) can
be approximated as

ωd − ω ∝ (k − kd)4 , at ω / ωd
This yields the following frequency dependence of the propagating mode group velocity

(16)

u =

dω
dk

∝ (kd − k)3 ∝ (ωd − ω)3/4 , at ω / ωd.

The amplitude of the transmitted slow mode in this case diverges, as the frequency
approaches the band edge value

WT ∝ |ωd − ω|

−1/2 ,

at ω / ωDBE,

which constitutes the frozen mode regime. But the amplitude does not grow fast
enough to oﬀset the vanishing group velocity (17). Indeed, the expressions (17) and
(18) together with (8) yield for the energy ﬂux

(17)

(18)

(19)

ST = WT u ∝

(ωd − ω)1/4 , at ω / ωd
0, at ω ≥ ωd

(cid:26)

,

implying that, in spite of the diverging energy density (18), the energy ﬂux of the
transmitted slow wave vanishes, as ω approaches ωd.

The situation at a degenerate band edge (16) can be viewed as intermediate
between the frozen mode regime at a stationary inﬂection point (12), and the vicinity
of a regular band edge (9). Indeed, on the one hand, the incident wave at ω = ωd is
totally reﬂected back to space, as is the case at a regular band edge. On the other
hand, the transmitted ﬁeld amplitude inside the periodic medium becomes very large
as ω → ωd, which is similar to what occurs at a stationary inﬂection point. The very
large amplitude (18) of the transmitted wave at ω ≈ ωd still can be very attractive
for applications.

The above consideration does not explain the nature of the frozen mode regime,
nor does it address the problem of the eigenmode composition of the frozen mode. All
these questions are the subject of the next subsection.

2.2. Physical nature of the frozen mode regime

2.2.1. Eigenmode composition of transmitted wave
In a periodic layered structure,
at any given frequency ω, there are four electromagnetic eigenmodes with diﬀerent
polarizations and wavenumbers. But in the setting of Fig. 5 where the semi-inﬁnite
periodic layered array occupies the half-space z ≥ 0, the transmitted wave is a
superposition of only two of the four Bloch eigenmodes.
Indeed, the propagating
waves with negative group velocity do not contribute to ΨT (z), nor do the evanescent
modes exponentially growing with the distance z. Generally, one can distinguish three
diﬀerent possibilities.

(i) Both Bloch components of the transmitted wave ΨT are propagating modes

ΨT (z) = Ψpr1 (z) + Ψpr2 (z) , z ≥ 0.

(20)

The transmitted wave ΨT in (20) is composed of two Bloch eigenmodes with two
diﬀerent real wavenumbers k1 and k2 and two diﬀerent group velocities u1 > 0
and u2 > 0. This constitutes the phenomenon of double refraction, provided that
u1 and u2 are diﬀerent. The other two Bloch components of the same frequency
have negative group velocities and cannot contribute to the transmitted wave ΨT .

(ii) Both Bloch components of ΨT are evanescent

ΨT (z) = Ψev1 (z) + Ψev2 (z) , z ≥ 0.

(21)

The respective two values of k are complex with positive imaginary parts k′′ > 0.
This is the case when the frequency ω falls into photonic band gap at ω > ωg
in Fig. 1(a) or at ω > ωd in Fig. 1(c). The fact that k′′ > 0 implies that the
wave amplitude decays with the distance z from the surface of the semi-inﬁnite
photonic crystal. In the case (21), the incident wave is totally reﬂected back to
space by the semi-inﬁnite periodic structure.

(iii) One of the Bloch components of the transmitted wave ΨT is a propagating mode

with u > 0, while the other is an evanescent mode with k′′ > 0

ΨT (z) = Ψpr (z) + Ψev (z) , z ≥ 0.

(22)

For example, this is the case at ω ∼ ω0 in Fig. 1(b), as well as at ω < ωg in Fig.
1(a) and at ω < ωd in Fig. 1(c). As the distance z from the surface increases,
the evanescent contribution Ψev in (22) decays as exp (−zk′′), and the resulting
transmitted wave ΨT (z) turns into a single propagating Bloch mode Ψpr.
Propagating modes with u < 0, as well as evanescent modes with k′′ < 0, never
contribute to the transmitted wave ΨT inside the semi-inﬁnite stack in Fig. 5. This
statement is based on the following two assumptions:

- The transmitted wave ΨT and the reﬂected wave ΨR are originated from the
plane wave ΨI incident on the semi-inﬁnite photonic slab from the left, as shown
in Fig. 5.

- The layered array in Fig. 5 occupies the entire half-space and is perfectly periodic

at z > 0.

Frozen light in periodic metamaterials

10

If either of the above conditions is violated, the electromagnetic ﬁeld inside the
periodic stack can be a superposition of four Bloch eigenmodes with either sign of
the group velocity u of propagating contributions, or either sign of k′′ of evanescent
contributions. For example, this would be the case if the periodic layered array in Fig.
5 had some kind of structural defects or a ﬁnite thickness.

The propagating modes with u > 0 and evanescent modes with k′′ > 0 are referred
to as forward waves. Only forward modes contribute to the transmitted wave ΨT (z)
in the case of a periodic semi-inﬁnite stack. The propagating modes with u < 0 and
evanescent modes with k′′ < 0 are referred to as backward waves. Since the backward
Bloch waves are not excited in the setting of Fig. 5, they play no role in further
consideration.

Note that the assumption that the transmitted wave ΨT (z) is a superposition
of propagating and/or evanescent Bloch eigenmodes may not apply if the frequency
ω exactly coincides with one of the stationary point frequencies (6). For example, at
frequency ω0 of stationary inﬂection point, there are no evanescent eigenmodes at all,
and the transmitted wave ΨT (z) is a (non-Bloch) Floquet eigenmode linearly growing
with z [9]. The term non-Bloch means that the respective ﬁeld distribution does not
comply with the relation (4). Similar situation occurs at frequency ωd of degenerate
band edge. At the same time, at any general frequency, including the vicinity of any
stationary point (6), the transmitted wave ΨT (z) is a superposition of two Bloch
eigenmodes, each of which is either propagating, or evanescent.

In all three cases (20 – 22), the contribution of a particular Bloch eigenmode to
the transmitted wave ΨT depends on the polarization ΨI of the incident wave. One
can always choose some special incident wave polarization, such that only one of the
two forward Bloch modes is excited and the transmitted wave ΨT is a single Bloch
eigenmode. In the next subsection we will see that there is no frozen mode regime in
the case of a single mode excitation. This fact relates to the very nature of the frozen
mode regime.

Knowing the eigenmode composition of the transmitted wave we can give a semi-
qualitative description of what happens when the frequency ω of the incident wave
approaches one of the stationary points (6) in Fig. 1. A consistent mathematical
analysis of the asymptotic behavior in the vicinity of diﬀerent stationary points is
rather complicated. The details can be found in [13] and references therein.

2.2.2. Regular photonic band edge We start with the simplest case of a regular
photonic band edge. There are two diﬀerent possibilities in this case, but none of
them is associated with the frozen mode regime. The ﬁrst one relates to the trivial
case where none of the layers of the periodic structure displays an in-plane anisotropy
or gyrotropy. As the result, all Bloch eigenmodes are doubly degenerate with respect
to polarization. A detailed description of this case can be found in textbooks on optics.
Slightly diﬀerent scenario occurs if some of the layers are anisotropic or gyrotropic and,
as a result, the polarization degeneracy is lifted. Just below the band edge frequency
ωg in Fig. 1(a), the transmitted ﬁeld ΨT (z) is a superposition (22) of one propagating
and one evanescent Bloch modes. Due to the boundary condition (3), the amplitude
of the transmitted wave at z = 0 is comparable to that of the incident wave. In the
case of a generic polarization of the incident light, the amplitudes of the propagating
and evanescent Bloch components at z = 0 are also comparable to each other and to

11

(23)

Frozen light in periodic metamaterials

the amplitude of the incident light

|Ψpr (0)| ∼ |Ψev (0)| ∼ |ΨI| , at ω ≤ ωg.

As the distance z from the surface increases, the evanescent component Ψev (z)
decays rapidly, while the amplitude of the propagating component remains constant.
Eventually, at a certain distance from the slab surface, the transmitted wave ΨT (z)
becomes very close to the propagating mode

ΨT (z) ≈ Ψpr (z) , at z ≫ L, ω ≤ ωg.

(24)

The evanescent component Ψev of the transmitted wave does not display any
singularity at the band edge frequency ωg. The propagating mode Ψpr does develop a
singularity associated with vanishing group velocity at ω → ωg − 0, but its amplitude
remains ﬁnite and comparable to that of the incident wave. At ω > ωg, this
propagating mode turns into another evanescent mode in (21). The bottom line is that
none of the Bloch components of the transmitted wave develops a large amplitude in
the vicinity of a regular photonic band edge. There is no frozen mode regime in this
case.

2.2.3. Stationary inﬂection point A completely diﬀerent situation develops in the
vicinity of a stationary inﬂection point (12) of the dispersion relation. At ω ≈ ω0, the
transmitted wave ΨT is a superposition (22) of one propagating and one evanescent
Bloch component.
In contrast to the case of a regular photonic band edge, in the
vicinity of ω0 both Bloch contributions to ΨT develop strong singularity. Speciﬁcally,
as the frequency ω approaches ω0, both contributions grow dramatically, while
remaining nearly equal and opposite in sign at the slab boundary [9]

Ψpr (0) ≈ −Ψev (0) ∝ |ω − ω0|

−1/3 , as ω → ω0.

(25)

Due to the destructive interference (25), the resulting ﬁeld

ΨT (0) = Ψpr (0) + Ψev (0)

at the photonic crystal surface is small enough to satisfy the boundary condition (3),
as illustrated in Figs. 6 and 7. As the distance z from the slab boundary increases,
the destructive interference becomes less eﬀective – in part because the evanescent
contribution decays exponentially

Ψev (z) ≈ Ψev (0) exp (−zk

′′

)

while the amplitude of the propagating contribution remains constant and very
large. Eventually, the transmitted wave ΨT (z) reaches its large saturation value
corresponding to its propagating component Ψpr, as illustrated in Fig. 7.

Note that the imaginary part k′′ of the evanescent mode wavenumber in (26) also

vanishes in the vicinity of stationary inﬂection point

increases as the frequency approaches its critical value ω0

12

(28)

If the frequency of the incident wave is exactly equal to the frozen mode frequency
ω0, the transmitted wave ΨT (z) does not reduce to the sum (22) of propagating and
evanescent contributions, because at ω = ω0 there is no evanescent solutions to the
Maxwell equations. Instead, ΨT (z) corresponds to a non-Bloch Floquet eigenmode
diverging linearly with z [9]

ΨT (z) − ΨT (0) ∝ zΨ0, at ω = ω0.

Figure 6. Frequency dependence of squared amplitude of the transmitted wave
(a), as well as its propagating (b) and evanescent (c) components at the surface of
semi-inﬁnite photonic crystal at z = 0. The stationary inﬂection point frequency
is ω0. Due to the destructive interference (25) of the propagating and evanescent
contributions, the amplitude (a) of the resulting transmitted ﬁeld remains small
enough to satisfy the boundary conditions. The amplitude of the incident wave
is unity.

2.2.4. Degenerate band edge While the situation with a regular photonic band edge
(9) appears trivial, the case of a degenerate band edge (16) proves to be quite
diﬀerent. Below the degenerate band edge frequency ωd, the transmitted ﬁeld is a
superposition (22) of one propagating and one evanescent components, while above
ωd, the transmitted wave is a combination (21) of two evanescent components. In this
respect, the regular and degenerate band edges are similar to each other. A crucial
diﬀerence, though, is that in the vicinity of a degenerate band edge, both Bloch
contributions to the transmitted wave diverge as ω approaches ωd, which constitutes
the frozen mode regime.

Let us start with the transmission band at ω < ωd. As the frequency ω approaches
ωd − 0, both Bloch contributions in (22) grow sharply, while remaining nearly equal
and opposite in sign at the surface

Ψpr (0) ≈ −Ψev (0) ∝ |ωd − ω|

−1/4 , as ω → ωd − 0.

The destructive interference (30) ensures that the boundary condition (3) can be
satisﬁed, while both Bloch contributions to ΨT (z) diverge. As the distance z from
the slab boundary increases, the evanescent component Ψev (z) dies out

Ψev (z) ≈ Ψev (0) exp (−zk

)

while the propagating component Ψpr (z) remains very large. Eventually, as the
distance z further increases, the transmitted wave ΨT (z) reaches its large saturation
value corresponding to its propagating component Ψpr (z), as illustrated in Fig. 8.

reducing the rate of decay of the evanescent contribution (31). As a consequence,
the resulting amplitude ΨT (z) of the transmitted wave reaches its large saturation

increases as the frequency approaches its critical value ωd

Z ∝ 1/k

as illustrated in Fig. 10(a, b).
If the frequency ω of the incident wave is exactly
equal to ωd, the transmitted wave ΨT (z) does not reduce to the sum of two Bloch
contributions.
Instead, it corresponds to a non-Bloch Floquet eigenmode linearly
diverging with z

ΨT (z) − ΨT (0) ∝ zΨd, at ω = ωd.

(34)

This situation is illustrated in Fig. 10(c).

The above behavior appears to be very similar to that of the frozen mode regime at
a stationary inﬂection point, shown in Fig. 7. Yet, there is a crucial diﬀerence between

(31)

(32)

(33)

Frozen light in periodic metamaterials

the two cases. Indeed, according to (19), in the immediate proximity of a degenerate
band edge, the Pointing vector ST of the transmitted wave ΨT is inﬁnitesimal, in spite
of the diverging wave amplitude (30). In other words, although the energy density
WT ∝ |ΨT |2 of the frozen mode diverges as ω → ωd − 0, it does not grow fast enough
to oﬀset the vanishing group velocity (17). As a consequence, the photonic crystal
becomes totally reﬂective at ω = ωd. Of course, the total reﬂectivity persists at
ω > ωd, where there is no propagating modes at all. By contrast, in the case (29) of a
stationary inﬂection point, the respective Pointing vector ST is ﬁnite and can be even
close to that of the incident wave. The latter implies low reﬂectivity and nearly total
conversion of the incident wave energy into the frozen mode.

In such a case, the transmitted ﬁeld ΨT (z) is a

superposition (21) of two evanescent components. As the frequency ω approaches
ωd. Both evanescent contributions grow sharply, while remaining nearly equal and
opposite in sign at the photonic crystal boundary

Ψev1 (0) ≈ −Ψev2 (0) ∝ |ωd − ω|

−1/4 , as ω → ωd + 0.

(35)

Again, the destructive interference (35) ensures that the boundary condition (3) is
satisﬁed, while both evanescent contributions to ΨT (z) diverge in accordance with
(35). As the distance z from the slab boundary increases, the destructive interference
of these two evanescent components is lifted and the resulting ﬁeld amplitude increases
sharply, as shown in Fig. 9. But eventually, as the distance z further increases,
the transmitted wave ΨT (z) completely decays, because both Bloch contributions to
ΨT (z) are evanescent. The latter constitutes the major diﬀerence between the frozen
mode regime above and below the DBE frequency ωd. The rate of the amplitude
decay, as well as the position of the maximum of the transmitted wave amplitude in
Fig. 9(a), are determined by the characteristic distance Z in (33).

modes Ψ1 (z) and Ψ2 (z)

ΨT (z) = Ψ1 (z) + Ψ2 (z) .

(36)

The two eigenmodes in (36) can be a propagating and an evanescent, as in the case
(22), or they can be both evanescent, as in the case (21). The physical reason for
the sharp increase in the transmitted wave amplitude at the frozen mode regime is
that the two Bloch eigenmodes contributing to ΨT (z) become nearly indistinguishable
from each other, as the frequency approaches its critical value

Ψ1 (z) ≈ αΨ2 (z) , as ω → ωs,

(37)

where α is a scalar, and ωs is the frozen mode frequency (ω0 or ωd).

Let us show under what circumstances the property (37) can lead to the frozen
mode regime. The sum (36) of two nearly parallel column vectors Ψ1 and Ψ2 must
match the boundary conditions (3) with the incident and reﬂected waves.
If the
incident wave polarization is general, then the nearly parallel Bloch components Ψ1
and Ψ2 must be very large and nearly equal and opposite

Ψ1 (0) ≈ −Ψ2 (0) ,

|Ψ1 (0)| ≈ |Ψ2 (0)| ≫ |ΨI | ,

(38)

in order to satisfy the boundary conditions (3).
Indeed, since the incident ﬁeld
polarization is general, we have no reason to expect that the column vector Ψ (0)
at the surface is nearly parallel to Ψ1 (0) and Ψ2 (0). But on the other hand, the
boundary conditions say that

Ψ (0) = Ψ1 (0) + Ψ2 (0)

(39)

Obviously, the only situation where the sum (39) of two nearly parallel vectors can be
not nearly parallel to either of them is the one described in (38).

There is one exception, though. Recall that in the vicinity of the frozen mode
frequency, the two Bloch components Ψ1 and Ψ2 of the transmitted wave are nearly
parallel to each other (see formula (37)). For this reason, if the polarization of the
incident wave is such that Ψ (0) in (39) is nearly parallel to any of the Bloch eigenmodes

Figure 10. Smoothed proﬁle of the frozen mode at six diﬀerent frequencies in the
vicinity of degenerate band edge: (a) ω = ωd − 10−4c/L, (b) ω = ωd − 10−6c/L,
(c) ω = ωd, (d) ω = ωd + 10−6c/L, (e) ω = ωd + 10−5c/L, (f) ω = ωd + 10−4c/L.
In the transmission band at ω < ωd, the asymptotic ﬁeld value is very large and
diverges as ω → ωd. By contrast, in the band gap at ω > ωd, the asymptotic ﬁeld
value is zero. In all cases, the amplitude of the incident wave is unity.

Ψ1 (0) and Ψ2 (0), it is also nearly parallel to both of them. In this, and only this
case, the amplitude of the transmitted wave ΨT (z) will be comparable to that of the
incident wave. There is no frozen mode regime for this narrow range of the incident
wave polarization. A particular case of the above situation is a regime of a single mode
excitation, where only one of the two Bloch components Ψ1 or Ψ2 in (36) contributes
to the transmitted wave.

Finally, let us reiterate that in the limiting cases of ω = ω0 or ω = ωd, the
transmitted wave ΨT (z) corresponds to a non-Bloch Floquet eigenmode (29) or (34),
respectively. Either of them linearly diverges with z. Again, the only exception is when
the incident wave has the unique polarization, at which the transmitted wave ΨT (z)
is a propagating Bloch eigenmode with zero group velocity and a limited amplitude,
comparable to that of the incident wave.

3. Oblique propagation. Abnormal grazing modes

A phenomenon similar to the frozen mode regime can also occur in the case of
oblique wave propagation, where the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves are
all propagate at an angle to the z axis, as shown in Fig. 11. Consider the situation
where the normal component uz of the group velocity of the transmitted propagating
wave vanishes, while the tangential component ~u⊥ remains ﬁnite.

(cid:17)

This is exactly what happens in the vicinity of the well-known phenomenon of total
internal reﬂection [6]. Similar phenomenon can be found in any photonic crystal
at frequency corresponding to the transmission band edge for a particular direction
of incidence. Remarkably, the total reﬂection of the incident wave is not the only
possible outcome. Another alternative is that the transmitted wave forms an abnormal
grazing mode with dramatically enhanced amplitude and tangential group velocity.
The photonic crystal reﬂectivity at the critical point (40) can be even low – quite the
opposite to what happens at total internal reﬂection. Low reﬂectivity implies that in
spite of the vanishing normal component uz of the transmitted wave group velocity,
almost all the energy of the incident wave is converted into an abnormal grazing mode
with drastically enhanced amplitude. The proﬁle of such a grazing mode, i.e., the
ﬁeld dependence on the distance z from the surface, appears to be very similar to
that of the frozen mode at normal incidence shown in Figs. 7, 8, 9, and 10. The
only diﬀerence is that the tangential component of the group velocity at an oblique
version of the frozen mode regime can be large and comparable to the speed of light in
vacuum. A signiﬁcant advantage of the oblique version of the frozen mode regime is
that it can occur in much simpler periodic structures, compared to those supporting
the frozen mode regime at normal incidence. Examples of periodic layered arrays
supporting only the oblique version of the frozen mode regime are shown in Figs. 3
and 4. These structures are too simple to support any kind of frozen mode regime at
normal incidence – they have only two diﬀerent layers per unit cell, of which only one
layer is anisotropic. But at oblique incidence, these relatively simple periodic arrays
can support the frozen mode regime. The presence of at least one anisotropic layer in
a unit cell L is still required.

Further in this section we outline some basic properties of the frozen mode regime

at oblique incidence.

3.1. Axial dispersion relation: basic deﬁnitions

Consider a plane monochromatic wave obliquely incident on a periodic semi-inﬁnite
stack, as shown in Fig. 11. Due to the boundary conditions (3), the incident, reﬂected
and transmitted waves should be assigned the same pair of tangential components
kx, ky of the respective wave vectors

vectors of the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves. The energy ﬂux SI of
the incident plane wave is unity.

Figure 12. The case of oblique incidence, where the transmitted wave is a grazing
mode with very large amplitude and purely tangential energy ﬂux.

Let us turn to the transmitted wave. The transmitted wave is usually a
composition of two Bloch eigenmodes with the same ~k⊥ = (kx, ky) from (41), but
diﬀerent kz. For given ~k⊥ and ω, the value of kz is obtained by solving the time-
harmonic Maxwell equations in the periodic medium. The so found correspondence
between the wavenumber kz and the frequency ω at ﬁxed ~k⊥ is referred to as the axial
or normal dispersion relation. Real kz correspond to propagating (traveling) Bloch
modes, while complex kz correspond to evanescent modes, decaying with the distance
z from from the surface. Unlike kx and ky, the Bloch wavenumber kz is deﬁned up to
a multiple of 2π/L.

Similarly to the case of normal propagation, the expression (40) deﬁnes stationary
points of the axial dispersion relation. The deﬁnition (40) is a generalization of (6) to
the case of oblique propagation. Diﬀerent kinds of axial stationary points are deﬁned

The above deﬁnitions are analogous to those in (9), (12), and (16), related to
the case of normal propagation. We still can refer to the k − ω diagrams in Fig. 1,
where the quantity k is now understood as the normal component kz of the Bloch
wavenumber at ﬁxed ~k⊥.

In order to further establish a close analogy between the cases of normal and
oblique propagation, let us introduce some standard procedure commonly used in
electrodynamics of layered media.
In the case of oblique propagation, the time-
harmonic electric and magnetic ﬁelds ~E (x, y, z) and ~H (x, y, z) depend on all three
Cartesian coordinates, both inside (at z > 0) and outside (at z < 0) the periodic
medium. Given the boundary conditions (41), the ﬁeld dependence on the transverse
coordinates x and y can be accounted for by the following substitution in the time-
harmonic Maxwell equations

~E (~r) = ei(kxx+kyy) ~E (z) , ~H (~r) = ei(kxx+kyy) ~H (z) .

(46)

The next step is a separation of the transverse components of ~E (z) and ~H (z) into a
close system of four linear diﬀerential equations

where Ψ (z) is a vector-column

∂zΨ (z) = i

similar to that in (1). An explicit expression for the matrix M (z) can be found, for
example, in Ref. [13], along with the detailed discussion of its analytical properties.





In the case of oblique incidence, the 4 × 4 matrix M (z) in the time-harmonic
Maxwell equations (47) depends not only on physical parameters of the periodic
structure, but also on the tangential components ~k⊥ = (kx, ky) of the wave vector. In
the particular case of normal propagation, the symmetry of the 4 × 4 matrix M (z) in
(47) increases so that it may become incompatible with the existence of a stationary
inﬂection point (12) and/or a degenerate band edge (16). This is why the axial frozen

Frozen light in periodic metamaterials

mode regime at oblique incidence can occur in some periodic structures which are
too simple to support the normal frozen mode regime. Examples such structures are
presented in Figs. 3 and 4.

All basic features of axially frozen mode regime at oblique incidence are virtually
the same as in the case of normal propagation.
In particular, all the formulae of
the previous section describing the structure and composition of the transmitted ﬁeld
ΨT (z) remain unchanged. This close similarity holds both for the frozen mode regime
at a stationary inﬂection point (44) and at a degenerate band edge (45). In either
case, Figs. 7 through 10 give an adequate idea of the frozen mode structure. Still,
there is one essential diﬀerence. Namely, in the case of axially frozen mode we have
to remember that the tangential component of the group velocity is not zero, even if
the normal component (40) vanishes. This means that the axially frozen mode is in
fact an abnormal grazing mode with purely tangential energy ﬂux, greatly enhanced
amplitude, and very unusual proﬁle. In the next subsection we elaborate on this point.

3.2. Axially frozen mode as an abnormal grazing wave

3.2.1. Stationary inﬂection point of axial dispersion relation Let us start with the
case (12) of stationary inﬂection point. In the vicinity of ω0, the transmitted wave
ΨT (z) is a superposition (22) of propagating and evanescent Bloch eigenmodes.
According to (25), both contributions to ΨT (z) have huge and nearly equal and
opposite values near the photonic crystal boundary, so that ΨT (0) is small enough
to satisfy the boundary condition (3). As the distance z from the slab boundary
increases, the evanescent component Ψev (z) decays exponentially, while the amplitude
of the propagating component Ψpr (z) remains constant and very large. As the result,
the ﬁeld amplitude reaches its huge saturation value at a certain distance (28) from
the slab boundary, as illustrated in Fig. 7.

Let us now introduce a unit vector ~n parallel to the direction of incident wave

propagation

nx = kxc/ω, ny = kyc/ω, nz =

1 −

and let ~n0 and ω0 be the direction of incidence and the frequency corresponding to a
stationary inﬂection point (44) of the axial dispersion relation. When the frequency
ω tends to its critical value ω0 at ﬁxed direction of incidence ~n0, the saturation value
−1/3 , according to (25).
Ψpr of the transmitted wave amplitude diverges as |ω − ω0|
This behavior is illustrated in Fig. 6. Conversely, when the direction of incidence ~n
tends to its critical value ~n0 at ﬁxed frequency ω0, the respective saturation value Ψpr
of the transmitted wave amplitude diverges as |~n − ~n0|

−1/3.

Consider now the frozen mode regime at oblique incidence in terms of refraction
of the incident plane wave at the photonic crystal boundary. In Fig. 13 we show a
wide monochromatic beam of frequency ω incident on the surface of the semi-inﬁnite
photonic crystal. The refraction angle θT is determined by the ratio of the normal
and tangential components of the group velocity

− θT = arctan

.

(50)

The direction of incidence ~n0 k ~SI in Fig. 13 is chosen so that the condition (44) of
the frozen mode regime is satisﬁed at ω = ω0. As frequency ω tends to ω0 from either

21

direction, the normal component uz of the transmitted wave group velocity vanishes,
while the tangential component ~u⊥ remains ﬁnite

uz ∼ |ω − ω0|2/3 → 0, ~u⊥ → ~u0 as ω → ω0.

This relation together with (50) yield

π
2

− θT ∝ |ω − ω0|2/3 → 0 as ω → ω0.

Evidently, in the vicinity of the frozen mode frequency, the transmitted (refracted)
propagating mode can be viewed as a grazing mode, because its group velocity becomes
parallel to the surface.

The most important and unique feature of this abnormal grazing mode directly
relates to the fact that the transmittance of the photonic crystal remains ﬁnite even
at ω = ω0.
Indeed, let AI and AT be the cross-section areas of the incident and
transmitted (refracted) beams in Fig. 13, respectively. Obliviously,

Let us also introduce the quantities

AT
AI

=

cos θT
cos θI

UI = AI SI , UT = AT ST ,

where SI and ST are the energy ﬂuxes of the incident and transmitted waves. UI and
UT are the total power transmitted by the incident and refracted beams, respectively.
The expressions (53) and (54) imply that

UT

which is nothing more than a manifestation of the energy conservation. Equation (55)
together with (52) yield

ST = τ SI

cos θI
cos θT

∝ |ω − ω0|

−2/3 → ∞ as ω → ω0.

(56)

where we have taken into account that τ cos θI is of the order of unity, as ω → ω0.

The expressions (52 – 56) show that in the vicinity of the frozen mode regime,
the transmitted beam is a grazing mode with very large intensity ST and sharply
reduce cross-section area AT , compared to those of the incident beam. By contrast,
in the vicinity of the photonic band edge the transmittance τ of the semi-inﬁnite slab
vanishes along with the normal component of the energy ﬂux ~ST of the transmitted
(refracted) wave.

The above qualitative analysis is only valid on the scales larger than the
characteristic length Z in (28). The value Z deﬁnes the distance from photonic crystal
surface, where the evanescent contribution to the transmitted wave is still signiﬁcant.
The latter restriction implies that the width of both the incident and the refracted
beams must be much larger than Z. Otherwise, the transmitted wave cannot be
treated as a beam, and the expressions (52 – 56) do not apply.

smaller by factor τ , due to much smaller cross-section area of the nearly grazing
transmitted wave.

edge frequency ωd in (45), the transmitted wave ΨT (z) is a superposition (22) of
propagating and evanescent Bloch eigenmodes. According to (30), both contributions
to ΨT (z) have very large and nearly equal and opposite values near the photonic
crystal boundary at z = 0, so that ΨT (0) is small enough to satisfy the boundary
condition (3). As the distance z from the slab boundary increases, the evanescent
component Ψev (z) decays exponentially, while the amplitude of the propagating
component Ψpr (z) remains constant and very large. As the result, the ﬁeld amplitude
reaches its huge saturation value at a certain distance from the slab boundary, as
illustrated in Fig. 7. At ﬁrst sight, this scenario is similar to the case of oblique frozen
mode regime at stationary inﬂection point of the axial dispersion relation. But there is
an important diﬀerence. As the frequency ω tends to its critical value ωd, the photonic
crystal reﬂectivity approaches unity, implying total reﬂection of the incident radiation.
In this respect, the situation below an axial degenerate band edge is reminiscent of
the classical phenomenon of total internal reﬂection. The diﬀerence, though, is that
the transmitted wave proﬁle ΨT (z) is the same as in the previously discussed case of
stationary inﬂection point of the axial dispersion relation. It implies that just below a
degenerate band edge frequency of axial dispersion relation, the transmitted wave can
be classiﬁed as an abnormal grazing mode with large diverging amplitude and large
tangential component of the energy ﬂux. The typical proﬁle of such a grazing mode

at ω / ωd is shown in Figs. 8(a) and 10(a – b).

If the incident wave frequency lies slightly above ωd (in the band gap), the
transmitted wave ΨT (z) is a superposition (21) of two evanescent Bloch eigenmodes.
The energy ﬂux in the abnormal grazing mode now is strictly parallel to the surface,
regardless of small variations in frequency and/or direction of propagation of the
incident wave. This is a direct consequence of the total reﬂectivity of photonic crystals
at band gap frequencies. The grazing mode proﬁle in this case is shown in Figs. 9(a)
and 10(d – f). As the frequency ω approaches its critical value ωd, the amplitude
and the thickness of the grazing mode diverge in accordance with (35) and (33),
respectively.

3.2.3. Surface waves in the vicinity of a degenerate band edge of axial dispersion
relation So far in this section we have tacitly assumed that

The inequality (57) implies that the z component (42) of the wave vector of the
incident and reﬂected waves is real. This is a natural assumption when considering
the problem of a plane wave incident on a semi-inﬁnite photonic crystal.

Consider now the opposite case where

y < ω2c2.

y > ω2c2.

(58)

In this situation, there is no plane propagating waves in vacuum matching the
boundary conditions (41) at the surface. Still, if the frequency ω lies above the band
edge of the axial dispersion relation (in the band gap), a superposition (21) of two
forward evanescent eigenmodes with k′′
z > 0 can produce a surface wave exponentially
decaying with the distance z from the boundary in either direction. As the frequency
ω approaches the degenerate band edge value ωd for a given ~k⊥, the surface wave
proﬁle can become similar to that of an abnormal grazing mode at ω ' ωd, shown
in Figs. 9(a) and 10(d – f). Although formally, it is still a surface wave, its proﬁle
now is highly unusual for a surface wave. Namely, the ﬁeld amplitude in the periodic
medium sharply increases with the distance z from the surface, reaches its maximum
at a distance Z deﬁned in (33), and only after that it begins a slow decay.

4. Conclusion

In this paper we outlined several diﬀerent manifestations of the frozen mode regime
in photonic crystals. Although all our numerical examples relate to periodic layered
structures, in fact, the frozen mode regime is more like a universal wave phenomenon.
Indeed, we can talk about diﬀerent kinds of wave excitations in low-loss periodic
media. But as soon as the respective Bloch dispersion relation displays a singularity
like a stationary inﬂection point (44) or a degenerate band edge (45), we have every
reason to expect a very similar behavior involving the frozen mode regime. In other
words, the possibility of the frozen mode regime is determined by some fundamental
spectral properties of the periodic structure. If a periodic array is relatively simple, for
instance, a stratiﬁed medium with one dimensional periodicity, its frequency spectrum
may prove to be too simple to support the proper spectral singularity. The more
complex the periodic structure is, the more likely it will be capable of supporting such

to that of degenerate band edge. The initial rate of growth of the frozen mode

a phenomenon. For instance, in the case of layered arrays we need birefringent layers
and, sometimes, at least three layers in a unit cell.

Another important question is how robust the frozen mode regime is. For
instance, what happens if we introduce a small absorption or structural imperfections?
Of course, these factors suppress the frozen mode amplitude. But in this respect, the
frozen mode regime is no diﬀerent from any other coherent or resonance eﬀects it
periodic structures. This problem can be solved at any particular frequency range by
appropriate choice of the constitutive materials.

Another fundamental restriction relates to the size of the periodic structure. In
this paper we assumed that the periodic array occupies the entire half-space z ≥ 0.
A good insight on what happens to the frozen mode in a ﬁnite periodic array is given
by Fig. 14. These graphs prove that the frozen mode regime in a ﬁnite periodic array
can be as robust as that in an imaginary semi-inﬁnite structure. The optimal number
of layers depends on such factors as the absorption characteristics of the constitutive
materials, the geometrical imperfections of the periodic array, the desired degree of

ﬁeld enhancement in the frozen mode, etc. On the other hand, in ﬁnite (bounded)
photonic crystals, some new resonance phenomena can arise, such as transmission
band edge resonances [2, 3, 14]. These eﬀects, though, occur at slightly diﬀerent
frequencies and are qualitatively diﬀerent from the frozen mode regime.

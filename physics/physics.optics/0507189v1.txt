We study the higher order harmonics of scalar modulational instability in the regime where it
arises spontaneously through ampliﬁcation of vacuum ﬂuctuations. We obtain detailed predictions
concerning the detunings, intensities, growth rates and spectral widths of the harmonics. These
predictions are well veriﬁed by experimental results obtained by propagating high intensity light
pulses through optical ﬁbers.

INTRODUCTION

In a non linear dispersive medium the propagation of
a continuous wave may be impeded by the phenomena
of Modulational Instability (MI) whereby the continuous
wave breaks up into a train of localized pulses. This
eﬀect has been predicted and veriﬁed in many branches
of physics, including ﬂuid dynamics[1], plasma physics[2],
non linear optics[3, 4, 5, 6], Bose-Einstein condensates[7].
In the spectral domain the instability induces the ap-
pearance of new frequencies whose amplitude grows ex-
ponentially. As the dynamical process continues more
and more energy is converted from the monochromatic
wave to the sidebands. Simultaneously harmonics of the
unstable frequencies appear and also grow exponentially.
Although the process of MI is by now textbook ma-
terial, the subsequent dynamics, and in particular the
appearance of the higher harmonics has been relatively
little studied. The main work we are aware about in this
context are theoretical [8] and experimental [9] investiga-
tions in the context of the Fermi-Paska-Ulam recurrence.
It is important to note that in these works the initial
noise was taken to be a classical wave at a speciﬁc fre-
quency and the analysis therefore involves a discrete set
of modes.

In the present work we study both theoretically and
experimentally the growth of the higher order harmonics
of MI in the regime where the instability arises by spon-
taneous ampliﬁcation of vacuum ﬂuctuations. The essen-
tial diﬀerence with respect to the earlier work mentioned
above is that in the present case a continuous spectrum
of vacuum ﬂuctuations is involved (rather than a discrete
set of modes). We will characterize each harmonic by
its detuning, its intensity and growth rate, and its spec-
tral width. Several of these features would be diﬀerent,
or would simply not appear (in the case of the spectral
width), if one was dealing with a discrete set of modes.
Our investigation is carried out in the regime of large
gain, when many photons have been created in the side-
bands, but before we reach the regime of pump depele-
tion (ie. before the energy in the side bands becomes

comparable to the energy in the initial the monochro-
matic wave). One of the main interests of our work is to
show how, even though we are working in a semiclassical
regime where many photons are produced, the fact that
the instability is seeded by vacuum ﬂucutations leaves a
distinct signature in the spectrum of the sidebands.

Our analytical predictions are well reproduced in our
experimental demonstration, based on light propagation
through optical ﬁbers. This system is particularly well
suited for the such investigations because light propaga-
tion in low loss silica ﬁbers is accurately described by the
Non Linear Schr¨odinger Equation (NLSE), hence suitable
to precise theoretical modelling, and because it is fairly
easy to work in a regime where initial noise is dominated
by vacuum ﬂuctuations. In fact the appearance of the
ﬁrst harmonic -probably seeded by vacuum ﬂuctuations-
was already reported in the ﬁrst experimental investiga-
tion of MI in optical ﬁbers[5]. Thus our approach pro-
vides quantitative explanation for the complex spectra -
readily observable in experiments- that arise in MI seeded
by vacuum ﬂuctuations in the regime of large gain. A
related comparison, but between numerical simulations
and experimental results- can be found in [10].

Finally we note that the ideas and methods developed
here are not restricted to the problem of scalar MI, but
should apply mutatis mutandis to other forms of MI such
as vectorial MI, and more generally to any unstable dy-
namical system involving a continuous set of modes (i.e.
described by partial diﬀerential equations), when the in-
stability is seeded by vacuum ﬂuctuations. We also note
that our analysis can also be applied if the initial noise
is classical white noise.

Section II A contains our theoretical analysis. Our
key result is eq. (16) which encapsulates our predictions
concerning intensities, growth rates, frequencies, spectral
widths of the harmonics. A discussion of the predictions
provided by eq. (16), of the hypotheses that go into its
derivation, and of its interpretation, are given in section
II B. Some background material, and details of some
calculations have been relegated to Appendices. Section
III describes our experimental setup and shows that the

experimental results are in good agreement with the the-
oretical predictions.

II. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS

A. Harmonics of Modulational Instability

Let A(x, τ ) be the slowly varying ﬁeld envelope of a
light pulse propagating in an isotropic single mode ﬁber
with carrier frequency ω0, where x is the coordinate along
the ﬁber and τ = t
x/vg is the time variable of coor-
dinates moving at group velocity vg. It obeys the NLSE

We take the unperturbed solution to be

A = A0eiφN L

(2)

with A0 a constant and φN L = γA2
0x is the non-linear
phase. As is well known, when β2 < 0 (the anomalous
dispersion regime), the continuous solution eq. (2) is un-
stable. We give the ”standard” derivation of this instabil-
ity (following [6]) in Appendix A, where we also include
the predictions of quantum theory (when the instability
is seeded by vacuum ﬂuctuations) and discuss the regime
of large gain.

In the present work we use a slightly diﬀerent approach
introduced by Hasegawa and Brinkman [4]. This will
allow us to derive many of the properties of the harmonics
of MI (which are inaccessible using the standard method
of Appendix A).

Our starting point is to parameterize the solution as:

A(x, τ ) = A0eiφN L(1 + ǫ(x, τ ))1/2eiσ(x,τ )

(3)

where ǫ and σ are real variables. Upon insertion of this
ansatz into the NLSE one obtains the equations

For n = 1 this describes the growth of the MI side-
bands; and for n > 1 it describes the growth of the har-
monics. As mentioned above the ﬁrst harmonic (n = 2)
also contains a component around ω = 0. One can repeat
the above calculation to ﬁnd that it is equal to 4P2, ie. it
has exactly the same shape as the ﬁrst harmonic around
2ωmax except that it is centered around ω = 0 and is 4
times more intense.

B. Summary of predictions and interpretation

Let us ﬁrst summarize the main predictions contained
in eq. (16); we will then discuss the interpretation and
limitations of our theoretical method. These predictions

4. Whereas the fundamental instability can be stim-
ulated by a classical signal around the frequency
ωmax, the harmonics cannot be stimulated. They
are entirely determined by the initial noise around
the frequency of the fundamental instability. We

have veriﬁed this prediction experimentally by in-
jecting a classical signal at frequency 2ωmax and
checking that it does not aﬀect power spectrum of
the harmonics.

5. The exact intensity of the harmonics is highly sen-
sitive to any classical noise present initially around
the frequency ωmax of the MI. Indeed the inten-
sity of the n
1’th harmonic will be multiplied by
(1/2 + nclass)n where nclass is the number of clas-
sical noise photons per mode initially present. The
sensitivity thus increases with the order of the har-
monic.

−

The derivation of eq.

(16) raises some interesting
points. First of all, the above analysis can be thought
of as an expansion valid when there is no pump deple-
tion, ie. when the power in the modulational instability
sidebands is small with respect to the power in the pump
beam. When pump depletion can no longer be neglected
our computation is no longer valid, since we supposed
that the pump amplitude is constant. Furthermore in
the regime where the pump gets depleted there will be a
back-action of the higher order harmonics on the lower
order ones, an eﬀect we neglected (for instance we only
considered the contribution of An to Pn, and neglected
the contributions of An′ , n′ > n).

The ratio η between the energy in the fundamental
ωmax, and the pump

sidebands at frequency ωmax and
energy can be explicitly computed to be

which shows that up to a slowly varying factor
intensity in the n-1’th harmonic is proportional to ηn. In
our computation we assumed that each successive har-
monic is smaller than the preceeding ones, ie. Pn < Pn
1.
This allowed us to neglect the back-action of higher or-
der harmonics on lower order ones. Obviously this cor-
responds to the condition η << 1.

The above analysis does not provide an exact solution
of the Non Linear Schr¨odinger equation (4). Rather we
have only solved the linearised equations of Hasegawa
and Brinkman eq.
(5). Thus our main prediction eq.
(16) cannot be exact. We expect that the growth rate and
spectral widths of the harmonics are robust predictions
because they depend only on the fact that the n
1’th
harmonic is proportional to ǫn. On the other hand the

prefactor, and in particular the value of the coeﬃcients
2 cannot be predicted correctly in the present ap-

|
proach. (Indeed by using as ansatz a non linear function
diﬀerent from eq. (3), all our results would be unchanged
except the coeﬃcients cn which would change). Never-
theless the simple ansatz eq. (3) gives surprisingly good
predictions for the intensities, see the experimental re-
sults reported in section III.

Let us conclude by sketching how one could carry out
a more systematic approach to the harmonics of the MI
that would predict correctly the prefactor of eq. (16).
(In fact during our ﬁrst investigations of this problem
we adopted this approach, but then switched to the ap-
proach of Hasegawa and Brinkman which is much simpler
mathematically). This systematic approach is neverthe-
less interesting, if only because it gives a diﬀerent point
of view to the problem.

Its starting point is the standard approach of the NLSE
based on the linear equations described in Appendix A.
There we took an ansatz of the form A = (A0 + A1)eiφN L
and linearised the equations in A1 to obtain eq. (A1).
But this is only an approximate solution. We can take
into account systematic corrections to this solution by
considering the ansatz A = (A0 + A1 + A2)eiφN L where
A1 is the solution of the linearised equations. One then
obtains for A2 the equation:

i∂xA2 =

1).
(17)
This is a linear equation for A2 with an independent
term. Thus the solution of the equation for A2 is a solu-
tion of the homogeneous equation plus a particular solu-
tion of the inhomogeneous equation. The independent
term is quadratic in A1 and therefore is proportional
to e2gmaxx and contains frequencies around 2ωmax and
around ω = 0. Upon solving for A2 one will ﬁnd that
A2 is largest around 2ωmax and around ω = 0 and is
proportional to e2gmaxx. Thus A2 will encode the be-
havior of the second and zero’th harmonic. Successive
orders in perturbation theory will give rise to the suc-
cessive harmonics. We leave the detailed investigation of
this approach to future work.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Our experimental set-up is reported in Fig. 1. It con-

taining ﬁber, although the experiment could equally have
been realized with non birefringent ﬁber. A half-wave
plate is used to ensure that the pump polarization is
aligned with a principal axis of the ﬁber, whereupon po-
larization eﬀects can be neglected and the above results
for scalar MI apply. The ﬁber parameters are deduced
from both scalar and vector modulation instabilities (see
Ref. [10]). The ﬁber length L is 51 m. The group-velocity

pump wavelength before the measurement of the spectra.
The rejection of the pump avoids detector blinding and
allows us to reach the sensibility limit of the optical spec-
tral analyzer (OSA).

The Narrow Band Filter (NBF) eliminates all resid-
ual photons except those at the pump wavelength. This
ensures that the MI and harmonics indeed arise from
vacuum ﬂuctuations and not from classical noise. We
have checked that this is indeed the case in two ways.
First numerical simulations of the Stochastic Non Linear
Schr¨odinger equation reproduce very well the observed
spectra, including the harmonics[10]. Second we have
studied in detail, using a single photon detector, the
MI in the regime where relatively few photons are pro-
duced. This investigation shows that there is in fact a
small amount of noise present due to spontaneous Ra-
man scattering in the ﬁber. But the number of Raman
photons per mode is much smaller than 1 which means
that they do not aﬀect the spectra when the gain is large.
In summary both investigations show that the MI pro-
cess is dominated by spontaneous eﬀects and stimulation
by classical noise is negligible.

A sample of the collected spectra is shown in Fig. 2
for diﬀerent pump powers P0. We clearly observe the
growth of the MI and the appearance and growth of the
harmonics as the pump power increases. The largest pair
of peaks correspond to the MI. Then each new harmonic
gives rise to a pair of peaks further and further from the

spectrum equal to 1001. In order to obtain a good over-
lap between theoretical curves and measured points, we
had to further shift δ(0) by 7 dB. This discrepancy is
not unreasonable given that the above theory was based
on a continuous pump, whereas now we are dealing with
a gaussian pulse, and given our inability to carry out
absolute measurements with the OSA. With this shift
the theoretical and experimental intensities agree well.
This shows that eq. (16), including both the exponential
terms and the prefactor, correctly predicts the absolute
intensities of the harmonics. We further conﬁrmed this
agreement by ﬁtting the intensity of each harmonic to an
exponential law In(P0)
An exp(αn2γP0L) where An is
an n dependent constant, and αn a growth factor (dotted
lines in Fig. 3). Theory predicts that αn/α1 = n. This

of the pump. The up-triangles, down-triangles, circles, and
squares represent respectively the fundamental MI peak (n =

monics. The dashed lines are a ﬁt to the data according to
an exponential law. The continuous curves are the theoretical
predictions of Eq. 16. As described in the text the experimen-
tal points were shifted by 7dB to agree with the theoretical
predictions. For clarity, we show a spectrum.

prediction is well veriﬁed, see Table I.

Note that around 60 W the total energy in the side-
bands becomes comparable with the pump energy: the
MI saturates and our analysis is no longer valid.

Theory predicts that the harmonic around ω = 0
should have the same growth rate, but 4 times the in-
tensity, as the harmonic around 2ωmax. There is reason-
able agreement concerning the growth rate, see Table I.
We were unable to check the factor of 4 as the intensity
measurements of the harmonic around ω = 0 were not
precise enough, although it is always more intense than
the harmonic around 2ωmax, see Fig. 2.

We now turn to the angular frequency shifts ωn(P0).
In Fig. 4 we plot the measured values and the theoreti-
cal predictions (continuous curves). We note a very good
overlap. Moreover, from the data in Fig. 4, we have com-
1)th harmonic frequency
puted the ratios between the (n
ωn(P0) and the fundamental frequency ω1(P0). The av-
ωn/ω1iP0 (where the average is over the dif-
erage values

ferent values of P0) are reported in Table I. There is good
agreement with the theoretical prediction ωn/ω1 = n.

Finally, the measured spectral widths σn are reported
in Fig. 5 as a function of P0. They are compared to
the theoretical values
L (straight lines). The

agreement is good for the fundamental frequency (n = 1)
and the ﬁrst harmonic (n = 2). In the case of the second
(n = 3) and third (n = 4) harmonics it is not possible
to conclude, although the values are consistent with an
increase in spectral width with the order of the harmonic.
This is because for high pump powers (> 60 W ) the MI

increases for all values of n. And when the peaks of

IV. CONCLUSION

In summary we have studied the higher order harmon-
ics of Modulational Instability in the regime where the
MI arises spontaneously through ampliﬁcation of vacuum
ﬂuctuations. We have shown that in this regime there is

7

a rich phenomenology which can be predicted theoreti-
cally and is well veriﬁed experimentally. In particular we
have obtained predictions for the detunings, intensities,
growth rates and spectral widths of the harmonics, see
our key result eq. (16); and found good agreement with
our experimental results based on light propagation in
optical ﬁbers. We note that the shape of the spectrum,
and in particular the relative intensities of the higher or-
der harmonics, is highly sensitive to the initial presence
of classical noise, and can therefore be taken as a signa-
ture that the MI is seeded by vacuum ﬂuctuations.
It
should be possible to extend our work in a number of
directions, for instance to predict exactly the coeﬃcients
2 appearing in eq. (16), to study the regime where
cn|
|
the pump starts to get depleted, and to extend it to other
forms of MI, or to other kinds of instabilities.

APPENDIX A: MODULATIONAL INSTABILITY

In this Appendix we recall the usual approach to MI.
We ﬁrst solve the linearised equations, then consider the
predictions of quantum theory, and ﬁnally consider the
regime of large gain. This appendix thus contains back-
ground material useful for reading the rest of the article.

In order to solve the NLSE eq.

(1) we consider an

ansatz of the form

A = (A0 + A1)eiφN L .

where A1 is a small perturbation. We linearise the NLSE
around the continous solution to obtain the equation for
A1:

2. Quantum Theory

The above solution of the NLSE can also be used to
derive the form of the instability when the Modulational
Instability is seeded by vacuum ﬂuctuations. In this case
eq. (1) should be interpreted as the Heisenberg equa-
tion for the operators ˆA and ˆA†. The Fourier transform
eq. (A2) deﬁnes the destruction operators ˆa1(x, ω). Their
hermitian conjugate ˆa†1(x, ω) are the creation operators.
These operators obey the commutation relations

[ˆa1(x, ω), ˆa†1(x, ω′)] = ¯h(ω0 + ω)δ(ω

ω′) .

(A8)

−

Equation (A5) should then be reinterpreted as giving the
relation between the creation and destruction operators
at distance x along the ﬁber and at the origin x = 0:

ˆa1(x, ω) = ˆa1(0, ω)µ(x, ω) + ˆa†1(0, ω)ν(x, ω) .

(A9)

The initial state

contains no photons:

i

ˆa1(0, ω)

From eq. (A9) one can then compute the expectation
values of products of creation and destruction operators
at distance x along the ﬁber. For instance one ﬁnds

It is inﬁnite because we have computed the power when
the pump beam is monochromatic and of inﬁnite dura-
tion. If we suppose that the pump beam lasts only for
a duration T then one should -as usual in these kinds of
situations- interpret this inﬁnity as

(A14)

We now consider the regime where the gain egx is large.
In this case we can simplify the solutions obtained above.
First of all we note that the produced photons will be
localised around the frequency ωmax at which the gain is
maximum:

2γA2
0
β2|
|
The maximum gain is given by

max =

ω2

.

gmax = g(ωmax) = γA2

0 .

(A15)

In order to describe the behavior in the vicinity of the
maximum gain we can expand the gain around ωmax as

g(ω)

gmax −

−

where we have kept only the exponentially growing terms
in µ, ν, used the approximate expressions derived in eq.
(A16) and dropped the ω dependence of the prefactors
in µ, ν.

Furthermore in the regime of large gain the quantum
solution simpliﬁes. Indeed since there are many photons
in each mode one can carry out a semiclassical treatment
in which one neglects ordering problems. Thus in this
regime one can reproduce the predictions of the quantum
solution by taking the initial conditions of the classical
solution a(0, ω) to be white noise with power ¯hω0/2 per
mode. More precisly the a(0, ω) should be taken to be
complex delta correlated gaussian random variable dis-
tributed according to the probability distribution

(A17)

(A18)

This will correctly reproduce the quantum predictions up
to corrections proportional to exp[
gx]. Indeed taking
the probability distribution to be gaussian correctly re-
produces in the regime of large gain the combinatorial
factors which arise from Wick contractions when expec-
tation values of the products of many creation and de-
struction operators are taken. Thus for instance in this
regime we have

The only new frequencies which appear at order n are
thus around

of the n’th order term around these frequencies which we
are interested in.

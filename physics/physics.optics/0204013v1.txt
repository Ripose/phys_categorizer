In quantum eletrodynamis, photon(cid:21)photon sattering an be the result of the ex-

terms in Maxwell's equations, similar to the nonlinearities due to polarization in non-

linear optis. These self-interation terms vanish in the limit of parallel propagating

waves. However if the modes generated in bounded regions are used, there will be

a non-zero total e(cid:27)et. We show that stationary two-dimensional light bullets an

Introdution

Aording to quantum eletrodynamis (QED), the non-lassial phenomenon

of photon(cid:21)photon sattering an take plae due to the exhange of virtual

eletron(cid:21)positron pairs. This is a seond order e(cid:27)et (in terms of the (cid:28)ne

struture onstant α ≡ e2/4πε0¯hc ≈ 1/137), whih in standard notation an

be formulated in terms of the Euler(cid:21)Heisenberg Lagrangian density [1,2℄

LEH = ε0F + ξ(4F 2 + 7G 2),

where ξ ≡ 20α2ε2

mass. The latter terms in expression (1) represent the e(cid:27)ets of vauum po-

larization and magnetization. We note that F = G = 0 in the limit of parallel

propagating waves. It is therefore neessary to use other waves in order to

obtain an e(cid:27)et from the QED orretions. Furthermore, it has reently been

shown that QED vauum nonlinearities an lead to self-fousing of laser beams

[3℄, and that suh e(cid:27)ets might be experimentally viable within a deade. In

Ref. [4℄ it was found that guiding strutures an be useful for the purpose of

deteting QED e(cid:27)ets, and a suggestion was presented for an experimental

setup that gives a measurable signal.

In the present work we thus onsider waves guided by two parallel onduting

planes, in order to study the possibility of using nonlinear QED e(cid:27)ets to

balane di(cid:27)ration and dispersion in diretions parallel to the planes. We (cid:28)nd

that our system is governed by a 1 + 2 dimensional nonlinear Shrödinger

equation (NLSE). Using approximate variational methods, whih have proven

to be useful in similar situations (see e.g. [5,6℄), we (cid:28)nd that the nonlinearities

an ounterat di(cid:27)ration and dispersion to form 2-dimensional light bullet

solutions, i.e., solitary solutions to the NLSE whih preserve the envelopes of

the (cid:28)elds.

starting point, are assumed to be perfetly onduting). We assume that only

one TEn0 mode (n = 1, 2, ...) is present. To linear order, this gives the (cid:28)elds

using the radiation gauge (φ = 0). A nonlinear dispersion relation an be de-

rived by inserting the linear expression for the (cid:28)elds into the right hand side of

Eq. (3), taking the z -omponent of the resulting equation, and separating into

orthogonal trigonometri funtions. From that equation the oe(cid:30)ients in the

NLSE an be found. However, here we will present an alternative derivation,

starting diretly from the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian (1), whih is more el-

egant and gives the same result. Naturally we must (cid:28)rst express LEH in terms

of the eletromagneti potential, sine it is the basis for the original varia-

tional priniple. We take

˜A to be weakly modulated
˜A = ˜A(t, z), and assume
(|∂ ˜A/∂t| ≪ |ω ˜A|, |∂ ˜A/∂z| ≪ |k ˜A|), but we omit the slow y -dependene, sine

suh a dependene makes the derivation tehnially more ompliated without

adding extra understanding. A di(cid:27)ration term in the y -diretion is lost by

this proedure, but this e(cid:27)et is trivially added afterwards. To lowest order,

we thus omit the nonlinear terms and the slow derivatives in L . Noting that
F = (1/2)[(∂A/∂t)2 − c2(∇A)2] and G = 0, we (cid:28)nd that the non-osillating

part (i.e. the part that does not vanish after integration) is

After performing the integration over the region between the plates we (cid:28)nd

that the lowest order part of the ation vanishes identially as the dispersion

relation is here onsidered to be satis(cid:28)ed. Going to the next order of approxi-

mation in the Lagrangian we inlude (cid:28)rst order slow derivatives, whih yields

L1/ε0 = L0/ε0 +iω[(∂A/∂t)A∗ −(∂A∗/∂t)A]−ikc2[(∂A/∂z)A∗ −(∂A∗/∂z)A].

After variation this leads to an equation where the envelope moves with the

group veloity. The next order and (cid:28)nal approximation inludes seond order

slow derivatives and the F 2
x-integration, dropping L0 (sine the ation is identially zero beause of the

term in the Lagrangian. After performing the

dispersion relation) and eliminating the seond order slow time-derivatives

using ∂2/∂t2 ≈ v2

available, numerial and approximate analysis give a lear piture of the so-

lutions. In partiular, it has been shown that Eq. (12) allows a stationary

solution where the di(cid:27)rative/dispersive spreading of the pulse in the oor-

dinate ρ is balaned by the fousing e(cid:27)et reated by the nonlinearity. An

aurate analytial approximation of the dynamis of the pulse-like solutions

of Eq. (12) an be obtained using diret variational methods involving the

Lagrangian L given by expression (13) and subsequent Rayleigh(cid:21)Ritz opti-

mization based on suitably hosen trial funtions (see e.g. [6℄ and referenes

therein). A onvenient trial funtion for the present problem is [5℄

3 Disussion and onlusion

From Se. 2, it is lear that the most interesting alternative is I0 > Ic , in whih

ase the QED vauum nonlinearities play a ruial role, leading to a ollapse.

In dimensional units the inequality I0 > Ic roughly leads to E2
crit ,
where Einit and rinit are the initial eletri (cid:28)eld and beam radius, respetively,
and the ritial QED eletri (cid:28)eld is de(cid:28)ned by E2
crit = ε0/ξ . Naturally this

unbounded self-fousing will eventually be saturated by some kind of higher

order nonlinear mehanism. However, this will not our before an eletri

(cid:28)eld level of order E ∼ Ecrit is reahed, whih is the (cid:28)eld strength when both

our perturbative nonlinear alulation sheme and our starting expression, the

Euler(cid:21)Heisenberg Lagrangian, breaks down. For suh extreme energy densi-

ties, higher order Feynman diagrams must be inluded in the QED desription,

and possibly the orresponding physial e(cid:27)ets may then ounterat the ol-

lapse senario, resulting in a saturated beam radius rsat ∼ rinitEinit/Ecrit . The

possibility to reah powers neessary for vauum self-fousing have been dis-

ussed in Ref. [3℄, whih onluded that it may our within the next 10(cid:21)15

years, given the urrent rate of tehnologial improvement.

A very interesting question from a prinipal point of view, would be whether

it is possible to have fully three-dimensional QED-strutures whih do not

require any guiding support. However, it seems that this issue annot be ad-

dressed within a perturbational approah, and further researh is thus re-

quired.

In this paper we have shown that the photon(cid:21)photon sattering, due to the

exhange of virtual eletron(cid:21)positron pairs, that e(cid:27)etively gives rise to self-

interation terms in Maxwell's equations, an ause optial ollapse in vauum

if the right onditions are met. More spei(cid:28)ally, high intensity eletromagneti

waves guided by two parallel onduting planes an form light bullets, whih

an ollapse if the intensity of the beams are high enough. However, it is

possible that higher order orretions to the Euler(cid:21)Heisenberg Lagrangian

an ounterat suh a ollapse senario, thus leading to stable optial vauum

strutures.

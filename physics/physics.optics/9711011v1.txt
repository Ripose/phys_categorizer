We theoretically analyze wave packet transmission through
a phase-conjugating mirror and show that the transmission of
a suitably chosen input pulse is superluminal, i.e. the peak of
the pulse emerges from the mirror before the time it takes to
travel the same distance in vacuum. This pulse reshaping ef-
fect can be attributed directly to the dispersion relation in the
nonlinear medium constituting the mirror. Thus, for the ﬁrst
time a connection is laid between optical phase conjugation
and superluminal behavior. In view of its additional ampli-
fying ability, a phase-conjugating mirror is a most promising
candidate for an experimental observation of tachyonic signa-
tures.

It is well known that transmission of a wave packet
through an absorbing medium gives rise to pulse reshap-
ing by dispersion [1]. The pulse seems to have been
transmitted with a speed larger than the speed of light,
or ”superluminally”. Similar behavior has recently been
observed in tunneling experiments using nondissipative
dielectric mirrors [2] and has been explained in terms
of destructive interference between causally propagating
consecutive components of the pulse [3]. Superluminal
particles, or ”tachyons”, were ﬁrst fully studied in the
sixties [4]. Theoretically, several models were developed
which give rise to tachyonic collective modes in, for exam-
ple, systems of inverted pendula [5] or inverted two-level
atoms [6]. However, experiments carried out to directly
observe tachyon-like excitations were so far without suc-
cess [7]. Here, we consider a phase-conjugating mirror
(PCM) consisting of a pumped nonlinear optical mate-
rial [8]. The dispersion relation in this material is shown
to be tachyonic, giving rise to group velocities larger than
the speed of light. We analyze the transmission of a gaus-
sian wave packet incident upon the PCM and ﬁnd that
its peak can be transmitted superluminally. This eﬀect is
a direct consequence of the dispersion relation and does
not violate causality, since the peak of the transmitted
pulse is not causally related to the peak of the input, but
originates from the forward tail of this incoming pulse. In
order to transmit information one could eg. use a discon-
tinuous incident signal. This kind of signal also exhibits
the superluminal peak-advancement, but the discontinu-
ity (information) is transmitted with the speed of light, in
full agreement with causality. A measurement of pulse
transmission through a PCM thus provides an experi-
mental signature of optical tachyonic excitations.

Our PCM consists of an optical medium with a large
third-order susceptibility χ(3). The medium is pumped
by two intense counterpropagating laser beams of fre-
quency ω0. When a weak probe beam of frequency ω0 + δ
is incident on the material, a fourth beam will be gen-
erated due to the nonlinear polarization of the medium.
This so-called conjugate wave propagates with frequency
ω0 − δ in the opposite direction as the probe beam [8].

In order to derive the dispersion relation for an electro-
magnetic excitation in this pumped medium, we consider
the one-dimensional wave equation for a nonmagnetic,
nondispersive material in the presence of a nonlinear po-
larization

phase-conjugation terms in the polarization. Assuming
the pump beams to be non-depleted and applying the
appropriate phase-matching conditions [8], we arrive at
two coupled equations for the amplitudes of the probe
and conjugate waves which are, using δ ≪ ω0 and taking

In vacuum κ0 = 0, and
(4) reduces to the four solutions k = ±(ω0 ± δ)/c. Note
that the group velocity in the nonlinear medium is always
larger than c, the speed of light in vacuum.

In view of this dispersion relation, the question arises
how wave packets will be transmitted through a PCM.
Because of the superluminal group velocity, tachyonic ef-
fects are expected. We begin by considering the transmis-
sion amplitude for a monochromatic probe beam incident
on a PCM, see Fig. 1.

Ep(L, t) is thus expressed as an integral in the complex s-
plane of the input pulse times the transmission amplitude
tpp [12]. The integration contour in (7) deﬁned by γ must
be chosen to the right of all singularities of tpp [11].

A direct calculation of these singularities leads to two
possible operating regimes of the PCM, in which the
pulse-reshaping upon transmission is entirely diﬀerent.
For κ0L < π/2, all singularities of tpp lie in the left half
s-plane [11] and Ep(L, t) is always ﬁnite. On the other

hand, if κ0L > π/2 there will be at least one singular-
ity in the right half s-plane. We then ﬁnd exponential
growth of the transmitted probe ﬁeld and hence the mir-
ror is said to be in an unstable (or ”active”) operating
regime [8]. Here we restrict ourselves to the case of stable
operation. The eﬀects of the instability will be discussed
elsewhere [13]. In view of the above, for κ0L < π/2, we
may take γ = 0 in (7). The substitution s → −iδ trans-
forms (7) into a Fourier integral, which can then be easily
evaluated numerically [11,14].

Fig. 2 shows the result for a gaussian input pulse
Ep(0, t) = e−αt2
eiδ0t which is centered around frequency
δ0 in the spectral domain. In (a) |Ep(L, t)| is plotted as a
function of t (in units of L/c) for various values of δ0, cor-
responding to diﬀerent positions on the dispersion curve
(Fig. 2(c)).

The vertical line indicates the time ttr = L/c needed
to traverse the mirror in vacuum. We see that an inci-
dent pulse which is centered in the middle of the gap in
the dispersion relation is strongly reshaped upon trans-
mission and that its peak appears delayed with respect
to ttr (curve 1). But if the incoming pulse is centered
around a frequency further away from δ = 0, its peak
emerges from the PCM before ttr (curve 2, enlargement
in Fig. 2(b)). The overall reshaping has become less,
but the peak traversal time is superluminal. Moving
still further up the dispersion curve yields a transmit-
ted pulse with shape almost identical to the incident one
and a peak traversal time approaching ttr from below
(curve 3). This is not surprising, since the frequency
components of the incident pulse now lie in that part of
Fig. 2(c) where the dispersion relation becomes asymp-
totically linear. The transmitted intensity Tpp then ap-
proaches unity,

Tpp(δ) ≡ |tpp(δ)|2 =

for δ ≫ κ0c,

and the pulse propagates almost as in vacuum.

Closer to δ = 0, the ampliﬁcation of the transmitted
pulse is larger and the superluminal peak advancement
becomes clearly visible, tpeak ≃ 0.75 ttr. This advance-
ment is a consequence of the increasingly superluminal
group velocity as δ → 0. For a pulse centered around δ0
very close to 0, however, the superluminal eﬀect disap-
pears. Such a pulse contains positive as well as negative
frequency components, and the presence of these compo-
nents with their largely compensating positive and neg-
ative group velocities leads to strong reshaping and a
delayed peak. The advancement is thus maximized for
pulses centered around a frequency δ0 which is small,
but still suﬃciently far away from 0 to avoid any inﬂu-
ence from the lower half of the dispersion curve. On the
one hand, the pulse should thus be spectrally narrow, in

2

order to be as close as possible to the gap region. But
on the other hand it should not be too narrow, since on
a temporarily very broad pulse the advancement, even if
substantial, would not be easily detectable. More quanti-
peak advancement
:
tatively, we have optimized the ratio
pulse width
r ≡ r(∆t, δ0, κ0) = ttr −tpeak
, where ∆t is the temporal
width of the incoming pulse. For the gaussian consid-
ered in Fig. 2 one ﬁnds, by varying simultaneously ∆t
and δ0 and keeping κ0 ﬁxed, that the optimal value of
r ≃ 0.073. For ﬁxed δ0 (and κ0) r decreases fast with
increasing temporal width of the incoming pulse [15].

∆t

We now demonstrate that the superluminal peak ad-
vancement does not disagree with the principle of causal-
ity, in the sense that the peak of the pulse does not trans-
mit any real information.

The expression (12) for Ep(L, t) in terms of modiﬁed

and serves as a double check for the results in Fig. 2.

for an incoming non-analytic signal, which is suddenly
switched on at t = 0, so Ep(0, t) = Ep(0, t) Θ(t) with Θ

FIG. 3. The transmitted probe pulse through a PCM at
x = L for a chopped gaussian pulse incident at x = 0 (thick
solid line). κ0L = 1.4.

For all values of δ0 the step is again transmitted
causally, traveling with the speed of light. One clearly
sees that for pulses centered around intermediate fre-
quencies in the dispersion diagram (δ0 ≃ 2.4 c/L) the
previously observed advancement of the pulse maximum
remains, because it is formed before an observer at x = L
learns about the chopped edge of the pulse. After trans-
mission of the step, the pulse decays, since there is no
further input signal to the mirror reenforcing and trig-
gering new multiple reﬂections.

Finally, consider a realistic phase-conjugating mirror,
consisting of a cell of length L ∼ 10−2 m. Reﬂectivi-
ties on the order of 100%, so tan2(κ0L) ∼ 1, have been
reported for PCM’s [17] and hence coupling strengths
κ0c ∼ c/L ∼ 1010s−1 can be reached. As seen from the
above, a pulse of temporal width ∼ 0.1 ns incident on this
PCM gives rise to peak advance and delay times ∼ 0.03
ns, well within range of observation.

Summarizing, we have studied the transmission of
wave packets through a phase-conjugating mirror. Based
on the tachyonic dispersion relation in the nonlinear
PCM medium, superluminal peak traversal times are pre-
dicted. Thus, a so far unnoticed link is established be-
tween optical phase conjugation and superluminal behav-
ior, which, especially in view of the amplifying properties
of a PCM, provides an excellent framework for an exper-
imental observation of a signature of optical tachyons.

κ0L gets closer to π/2. Note, however that in the limit
κ0L → π/2 and δ0 → 0, when the transmitted probe in-
tensity becomes inﬁnite [8], our analysis is not valid any-
more, since there pump depletion is bound to reduce the
transmitted intensity. A more sophisticated treatment is
then required. In this paper we are always in a situation
where pump depletion is negligibly small.

[16] Because the Fourier transform of a discontinuous time-
pulse contains frequencies ranging from −∞ to +∞, care
has to be taken in applying (7) to these kind of pulses,
since (7) is based on the assumption δ ≪ ω0. How-
ever, for the chopped pulses considered here, the weight
of frequency components close to ω0 (which is typically

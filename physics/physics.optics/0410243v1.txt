We analyze nonlinear properties of microstructured materials with negative refraction, the so-
called left-handed metamaterials. We demonstrate that the hysteresis-type dependence of the mag-
netic permeability on the ﬁeld intensity allows changing the material properties from left- to right-
handed and back. Using the ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain simulations, we study wave transmission
through the slab of nonlinear left-handed material, and predict existence of temporal solitons in
such materials. We demonstrate also that nonlinear left-handed metamaterials can support both
TE- and TM-polarized self-trapped localized beams, spatial electromagnetic solitons. Such solitons
appear as single- and multi-hump beams, being either symmetric or antisymmetric, and they can
exist due to the hysteresis-type magnetic nonlinearity and the eﬀective domains of negative magnetic
permeability.

INTRODUCTION

Recent theoretical studies [1, 2, 3] and experimental re-
sults [4, 5, 6] have shown the possibility of creating novel
types of microstructured materials that demonstrate the
property of negative refraction. In particular, the com-
posite materials created by arrays of wires and split-ring
resonators were shown to possess a negative real part
of the magnetic permeability and dielectric permittivity
for microwaves. These materials are often referred to as
left-handed materials (LHMs) or materials with negative
refraction. Properties of such materials were analyzed
theoretically by Veselago a long time ago [7], but they
were demonstrated experimentally only recently. As was
shown by Veselago [7], left-handed materials possess a
number of peculiar properties, including negative refrac-
tion for interface scattering, inverse light pressure, and
reverse Doppler and Vavilov-Cherenkov eﬀects.

So far, most of the properties of left-handed materi-
als were studied in the linear regime of wave propaga-
tion when both the magnetic permeability and the di-
electric permittivity of the material are assumed to be
independent on the intensity of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
However, any future eﬀort in creating tunable structures
where the ﬁeld intensity changes the transmission proper-
ties of the composite structure would require the knowl-
edge of nonlinear properties of such metamaterials, which
may be quite unusual. In particular, the recently fabri-
cated metamaterials consist of arrays of wires and split-
ring resonators (SRRs). The array of wires provides
negative dielectric permittivity, while SRRs give nega-
tive magnetic permeability. Metamaterials possess left-
handed properties only in some ﬁnite frequency range,
which is basically determined by the geometry of the
structure. The possibility to control the eﬀective param-
eters of the metamaterial using nonlinearity has recently
been suggested in Refs. [8, 9]. Importantly, the micro-
scopic electric ﬁeld in the structure can be much higher

than the macroscopic electric ﬁeld in the wave. This pro-
vides the mechanism for enhanced nonlinear eﬀects.

In this paper we analyze nonlinear properties of left-
handed metamaterials for the example of a lattice of the
split-ring resonators and wires with a nonlinear dielec-
tric. By means of ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD)
simulations we study the wave scattering on a slab of
nonlinear composite structure. We also discuss the struc-
ture of electromagnetic solitons supported by the non-
linear left-handed materials with hysteresis-type nonlin-
ear response. We believe that our ﬁndings may stimu-
late future experiments in this ﬁeld, as well as studies
of nonlinear eﬀects in photonic crystals, where the phe-
nomenon of negative refraction is analyzed now very in-
tensively [10, 11].

II. NONLINEAR RESONANT RESPONSE

We follow the original paper [8] and consider a two-
dimensional composite structure consisting of a square
lattice of the periodic arrays of conducting wires and
split-ring resonators (SRR). We assume that the unit-cell
size d of the structure is much smaller then the wave-
length of the propagating electromagnetic ﬁeld and, for
simplicity, we choose the single-ring geometry of a lattice
of cylindrical SRRs. The results obtained for this case
are qualitatively similar to those obtained in the more
involved cases of double SRRs. This type of microstruc-
tured materials has recently been suggested and built in
order to create left-handed metamaterials with negative
refraction in the microwave region [4].

The negative real part of the eﬀective dielectric per-
mittivity of such a composite structure appears due to
the metallic wires whereas a negative sign of the mag-
netic permeability becomes possible due to the SRR lat-
tice. As a result, these materials demonstrate the prop-
erties of negative refraction in the ﬁnite frequency band,

Nonlinear response of such a composite structure can
be characterized by two diﬀerent contributions. The ﬁrst
one is an intensity-dependent part of the eﬀective dielec-
tric permittivity of the inﬁlling dielectric. For simplicity,
we may assume that the metallic structure is embedded
into a nonlinear dielectric with a permittivity that de-
pends on the intensity of the electric ﬁeld in a general
E
2). For results of calculations pre-
form, ǫD = ǫD(

sented below, we take the linear dependence that corre-
sponds to the Kerr-type nonlinear response.

The second contribution into the nonlinear properties
of the composite material comes from the lattice of res-
onators, since the SRR capacitance (and, therefore, the
SRR eigenfrequency) depends on the strength of the lo-
cal electric ﬁeld in a narrow slot. The intensity of the
local electric ﬁeld in the SRR gap depends on the elec-
tromotive force in the resonator loop, which is induced
by the magnetic ﬁeld. Therefore, the eﬀective magnetic
permeability µeﬀ depends on the macroscopic (average)
magnetic ﬁeld H, and this dependence can be found in
the form [8]

is the eigenfrequency of oscillations in the presence of the
external ﬁeld of a ﬁnite amplitude, h is the width of the
ring, Γ = c2/2πσah, for h < δ, and Γ = c2/2πσaδ, for
h > δ. It is important to note that Eq. (1) has a simple
physical interpretation: The resonant frequency of the
artiﬁcial magnetic structure depends on the amplitude
of the external magnetic ﬁeld and, in turn, this leads to
the intensity-dependent function µeﬀ .

Figures 1 and 2 summarize diﬀerent types of nonlin-
ear magnetic properties of the composite, which are de-
ﬁned by the dimensionless frequency of the external ﬁeld
Ω = ω/ω0, for both a focusing [Figs. 1, 2(a,b)] and a
defocusing [Figs. 1, 2(c,d)] nonlinearity of the dielectric.

Due to the high values of the electric ﬁeld in the slot
of SRR as well as resonant interaction of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld with the SRR lattice, the characteristic
magnetic nonlinearity in such structures is much stronger
then the corresponding electric nonlinearity. Therefore,
magnetic nonlinearity should dominate in the composite
metamaterials. More importantly, the nonlinear medium

can be created by inserting nonlinear elements into the
slots of SRRs, allowing an easy tuning by an external
ﬁeld.

The critical ﬁelds for switching between LH and RH
states, shown in the Figs. 1 can be reduced to a desirable
value by choosing the frequency close to the resonant
frequency of SRRs. Even for a relatively large diﬀer-
ence between the SRR eigenfrequency and the external
frequency, as we have in Fig. 1(b) where Ω = 0.8 (i.e.
ω = 0.8ω0), the switching amplitude of the magnetic

ﬁeld is
ing nonlinearity can be estimated for some materials such
as n-InSb for which Ec = 200V /cm [13]. As a result, the
strength of the critical magnetic ﬁeld is found as Hc1

quencies are found in BaxSr1−xTiO3 (see Ref. [14] and
references therein). The critical nonlinear ﬁeld of a thin

ﬁlm of this material is Ec = 4

·

The possibility of strongly enhanced nonlinearities in
left-handed metamaterials revealed here may lead to an
essential revision of the concepts based on the linear the-
ory, since the electromagnetic waves propagating in such
materials always have a ﬁnite amplitude. At the same
time, the engineering of nonlinear composite materials
will open a number of their novel applications such as
frequency multipliers, beam spatial spectrum transform-
ers, switchers, limiters, etc.

As a result, Eqs.(2-6) form a closed system of equations
and it can be solved numerically using FDTD method.
Note, that substituting harmonic ﬁelds in this system
of equations, one can ﬁnd expression for the magnetic
permeability (1).

To study the temporal dynamics of the wave scattering
on the nonlinear metamaterial we consider 1D problem,
which describes interaction of the plane wave incident
at normal angle from air on a slab of metamaterial of
ﬁnite thickness. We consider two types of nonlinear ef-
fects: (i) nonlinear darkening, when initially transpar-
ent left-handed material becomes opaque, and (ii) non-
linear induced transparency, when the opaque metama-
terial becomes left-handed transparent. The ﬁrst case
corresponds to the dependence of the eﬀective magnetic
permeability on the external ﬁeld shown in Figs. 1(a, c),
when initially negative magnetic permeability (we con-
sider ǫ negative in all frequency range under study),

becomes positive with increase of the intensity of the
magnetic ﬁeld. The second case corresponds to the de-
pendence of the magnetic permeability on external ﬁeld
shown in Figs. 1(b).

In all simulations we use linearly increasing amplitude
of the incident ﬁeld within ﬁrst ﬁfty periods of wave,
and constant afterwords. The slab thickness equals to
1.3λ0 where λ0 is a free-space wavelength. We have taken
the material parameters so that the metamaterial is left-
handed in linear regime in the frequency range from f1 =
5.787 GHz to f2 = 6.05 GHz.

Our simulations have shown that for the incident wave
with the frequency f0 = 5.9 GHz (i.e.
inside the left-
handed transmission band), independently of the sign of
the nonlinearity, electromagnetic ﬁeld reaches the steady
state. The stationary reﬂection and transmission coeﬃ-
cients as a function of the incident ﬁeld amplitude are
shown in Figs. 3,4 for defocussing and focussing nonlin-
ear properties of the dielectric inﬁlling SRR slits. We
note, that in linear regime, parameters of the metama-
terial on the frequency f0 are ǫ =
0.01i and
µ =
0.3i, providing excellent impedance match-
ing with surrounding air. It results in vanishing reﬂec-
tion coeﬃcient for small incident ﬁeld intensities (see
Figs. 3,4).

Structure of the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients
is qualitatively diﬀerent for various types of inﬁlling non-
linear dielectric. For defocussing nonlinearity the reﬂec-
tion coeﬃcient is switching from low to high level, when
the incident ﬁeld becomes larger than some threshold
value (see Fig. 3). Such transition can be explained in
terms of hysteresis behavior of the magnetic permeability
shown in Fig. 1(c). When the ﬁeld amplitude in metama-
terial becomes higher than the critical amplitude (shown
by the dashed arrow in Fig. 1(c)), magnetic permeability

becomes positive, and the metamaterial becomes opaque.
Our FDTD simulations show that for overcritical ampli-
tudes of the incident ﬁeld, the opaque region of positive
magnetic permeability appears inside the slab (see inset
in Fig. 3). We note that the magnetic permeability ex-
periences abrupt change on the boundary between trans-
parent and opaque regions. The dependencies shown in
Fig. 3 were obtained, when the incident ﬁeld increased
from zero to the steady state value, as discussed above.
However, taking diﬀerent temporal behavior of the inci-
dent wave, e.g.
increasing it above the threshold value
and then decreasing it to the steady state, one can get
diﬀerent values of the stationary reﬂection and transmis-
sion coeﬃcients, and diﬀerent distributions of the mag-
netic permeability inside the slab of LHM. Such prop-
erties of the nonlinear metamaterial slab are consistent
with multi-valued dependence of the magnetic permeabil-
ity on the amplitude of the magnetic ﬁeld.

In the case of focussing nonlinearity (see Fig. 4), we
have a smooth dependence of the reﬂection and trans-
mission coeﬃcients on the amplitude of the incident ﬁeld.
Such behavior results, ﬁrstly, from the gradual detuning
from the impedance matching condition, and, for higher
powers, from the appearance of the opaque layer (see in-
set in Fig. 4) with positive magnetic permeability. Mag-
netic permeability in this case is a continuous function of
the coordinate inside the slab.

Now we consider the case, when initially opaque meta-
material becomes transparent with increase of the ampli-
tude of the incident ﬁeld. We take the frequency of the in-
cident ﬁeld to be f0 = 5.67 GHz, so that in linear regime
magnetic permeability is positive, and the metamaterial
is opaque. In the case of α = 1, or self-focussing proper-
ties on dielectric it is possible to switch to the regime with
negative magnetic permeability (see Fig.1(b)) and make

the material left-handed transparent. Moreover, one can
expect the possibility of formation of localized states in-
side the composite, the eﬀect which was previously dis-
cussed for the interaction of the intense electromagnetic
waves with overdense plasma [17]. Figure 5(a) shows de-
pendence of the incident and reﬂected wave intensities
as a function of time for small input intensities, which
corresponds to the linear regime. The reﬂection reaches
the steady state after approximately 100 periods. Elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁeld proﬁles at the end of simulations
are shown in Fig. 5(b,c).

In a weakly overcritical regime (see Fig. 6), the inten-
sity of the reﬂected beam decreasing while approaching
to the steady state. In this case we note the formation
of the localized state in the vicinity of the metamaterial
edge, (as can be seen more distinctly on Fig. 6(c)), which
provides additional absorption of the electromagnetic en-
ergy, thus decreasing the reﬂection coeﬃcient.

In the strongly overcritical regime (see Fig. 7), we ob-
serve dynamical self-modulation of reﬂected electromag-
netic wave, which results from periodic formation of the
self-localized states inside the metamaterial. Such local-
ized states resemble temporal solitons, which transfer the
energy away from the interface. Fig. 7(c) shows two lo-
calized states inside the metamaterial. These localized
states appear on the jumps of the magnetic permeabil-
ity, and, as a result, we observe the change of the sign
of the derivative of electric ﬁeld at the maximum of the
soliton intensity, and creation of the transparent regions
of the metamaterial. Compared to all previous cases,
ﬁeld structure did not reach steady state for high enough
intensities of the incident ﬁeld.

IV. ELECTROMAGNETIC SPATIAL SOLITONS

Nonlinear left-handed composite media can support
self-trapped electromagnetic waves in the form of spa-
tial solitons. Such solitons possess interesting proper-
ties because they exist in materials with a hysteresis-
type (multi-stable) nonlinear magnetic response. Below,
we describe novel and unique types of single- and multi-
hump (symmetric, antisymmetric, or even asymmetric)
backward-wave spatial electromagnetic solitons existing
due to the eﬀective domains of nonlinear magnetic per-
meability.

Spatially localized TM-polarized waves that are de-
scribed by one component of the magnetic ﬁeld and two
components of the electric ﬁeld. Monochromatic station-
ary waves with the magnetic ﬁeld component H = Hy
propagating along the z-axis and homogeneous in the
y-direction, [
ikz)], are described by the di-
mensionless nonlinear Helmholtz equation

mensionless coordinate, and x′ is the dimensional coor-
dinate. Diﬀerent types of localized solutions of Eq. (7)
can be analyzed on the phase plane (H, dH/dx) (see,
e.g., Refs. [18]). First, we ﬁnd the equilibrium points:

(0, H1), where H1 is found as a solution of the equation

FIG. 8: Examples of diﬀerent types of solitons: (a) fun-
damental soliton; (b,c) solitons with one domain of negative
or positive magnetic permeability (shaded), respectively; (d)
soliton with two diﬀerent domains (shaded). Insets in (b,c)
show the magniﬁed regions of the steep change of the mag-
netic ﬁeld.

is a saddle point and, therefore, no ﬁnite-amplitude or
localized waves can exist. Above the threshold value, i.e.
for γ > γtr, the phase plane has three equilibrium points,
and a separatrix curve corresponds to a soliton solution.

In the vicinity of the equilibrium state (0, 0), linear
solutions of Eq. (7) describe either exponentially grow-
ing or exponentially decaying modes. The equilibrium
state (0, H1) describes a ﬁnite-amplitude wave mode of
the transverse electromagnetic ﬁeld.
In the region of
multi-stability, the type of the phase trajectories is de-
ﬁned by the corresponding branch of the multi-valued
magnetic permeability. Correspondingly, diﬀerent types
of the spatial solitons appear when the phase trajecto-
ries correspond to the diﬀerent branches of the nonlinear
magnetic permeability.

The fundamental soliton is described by the separa-
trix trajectory on the plane (H, dH/dx) that starts at
the point (0, 0), goes around the center point (0, H1),
and then returns back; the corresponding soliton proﬁle
is shown in Fig. 8(a). More complex solitons are formed
when the magnetic permeability becomes multi-valued
and is described by several branches. Then, soliton so-
lutions are obtained by switching between the separatrix
trajectories corresponding to diﬀerent (upper and lower)
branches of magnetic permeability. Continuity of the
tangential components of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds
at the boundaries of the domains with diﬀerent values of
magnetic permeability implies that both H and dH/dx
should be continuous. As a result, the transitions be-
tween diﬀerent phase trajectories should be continuous.
Figures 8(b,c) show several examples of the more com-
plex solitons corresponding to a single jump to the lower
branch of µ(H) (dotted) and to the upper branch of µ(H)

6

(dashed), respectively. The insets show the magniﬁed
domains of a steep change of the magnetic ﬁeld. Both
the magnetic ﬁeld and its derivative, proportional to the
tangential component of the electric ﬁeld, are continu-
ous. The shaded areas show the eﬀective domains where
the value of magnetic permeability changes. Figure 8(d)
shows an example of more complicated multi-hump soli-
ton which includes two domains of the eﬀective magnetic
permeability, one described by the lower branch, and the
other one – by the upper branch. In a similar way, we
can ﬁnd more complicated solitons with diﬀerent number
of domains of the eﬀective magnetic permeability.

We note that some of the phase trajectories have dis-
continuity of the derivative at H = 0 caused by inﬁnite
values of the magnetic permeability at the correspond-
ing branch of µeﬀ(H). Such a non-physical eﬀect is an
artifact of the lossless model of a left-handed nonlinear
composite considered here for the analysis of the soliton
solutions.
In more realistic models that include losses,
the region of multi-stability does not extend to the point
H = 0, and in this limit the magnetic permeability re-
mains a single-valued function of the magnetic ﬁeld [8].

For such a multi-valued nonlinear magnetic response,
the domains with diﬀerent values of the magnetic per-
meability ”excited” by the spatial soliton can be viewed
as eﬀective induced left-handed waveguides which make
possible the existence of single- and multi-hump soliton
structures. Due to the existence of such domains, the
solitons can be not only symmetric, but also antisym-
metric and even asymmetric. Formally, the size of an ef-
fective domain can be much smaller than the wavelength
and, therefore, there exists an applicability limit for the
obtained results to describe nonlinear waves in realistic
composite structures.

When the inﬁlling dielectric of the structure displays
self-focusing nonlinear response, we have Ω < 1, and in
such system we can ﬁnd dark solitons, i.e. localized dips
on the ﬁnite-amplitude background wave [19]. Similar to
bright solitons, there exist both fundamental dark soli-
tons and dark solitons with domains of diﬀerent values
of magnetic permeability. For self-defocusing nonlinear-
ity and Ω < 1, magnetic permeability is a single-valued
function, and such a nonlinear response can support dark
solitons as well, whereas for self-focusing dielectric, we
have Ω > 1 and no dark solitons can exist.

In conclusion, we have analyzed nonlinear response of
left-handed metamaterials. For the harmonic ﬁelds we
have calculated eﬀective magnetic permeability and pre-
dicted hysteresis behavior of the magnetic permeability
as a function of applied magnetic ﬁeld. We have studied
temporal dynamics of the wave reﬂection from the slab
of nonlinear metamaterial using FDTD simulations. Fi-
nally, we predicted the existence of electromagnetic spa-
tial solitons supported by the hysteresis-type nonlinear
magnetic permeability.

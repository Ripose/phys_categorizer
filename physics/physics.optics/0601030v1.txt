Abstract

We characterize the reﬂectance peak near the Brewster angle for both an interface between two

dielectric media and a single slab. To approach this problem analytically, we approximate the

reﬂectance by a ﬁrst-order diagonal Pad´e. In this way, we calculate the width and the skewness of

the peak and we show that, although they present a well-resolved maximum, they are otherwise

not so markedly dependent on the refractive index.

INTRODUCTION

As it is well known, the behavior of the light reﬂected at the boundary between two

dielectrics drastically depends on whether the associated electric ﬁeld lies parallel (p polar-

ization) or perpendicular (s polarization) to the plane of incidence. This is quantiﬁed by

the Fresnel formulas [1], which also conﬁrm that at a certain angle θB the p-polarized ﬁeld

drops to zero. This angle is commonly referred to as the Brewster angle and, in spite of its

simplicity, it is a crucial concept in the optics of reﬂection [2].

In fact, this notion is at the heart of a number of methods for optical thin-ﬁlm charac-

terization. These include Brewster-angle microscopy [3, 4, 5], which furnishes a direct visu-

alization of the morphology of the ﬁlm, or the Abel`es Brewster-angle method [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

for determining the refractive index. They are quite popular because are noncontact, easy

to set up and simple to use. The basic idea can be concisely stated as follows: coated and

bare regions of a substrate are illuminated with p-polarized light and the angle of incidence

is scanned for a reﬂectance-match angle. Visual observation is often used because it reveals

local variations in ﬁlm thickness and in homogeneity of refractive index.

These techniques rely on the dependence of reﬂectance near the Brewster angle on the re-

fractive indices involved. Of course, one could rightly argue that all the relevant information

is contained in the Fresnel formulas. However, given their nonlinear features, no physical

insights on the behavior around θB can be easily inferred, nor an analysis of the error sources

can be easily carried out, except by numerical methods [11]. Some qualitative comments can

be found scattered in the literature: for example, it is sometimes argued that the amplitude

2

reﬂection coeﬃcient for p polarization is approximately linear around θB [12]. Nevertheless,

we think that a comprehensive study of the reﬂectance near the Brewster angle behavior is

missing and it is precisely the main goal of this paper.

To this end, we propose to look formally at the reﬂectance as a probability distribution

and focus on its central moments, which leads us to introduce very natural measures of the

width and the skewness of that peak through the second and third moments [13]. Since

all these calculations must be performed only in a neighborhood of θB, we replace the

exact reﬂectance by a Pad´e approximant [14]: apart from the elegance of this approach,

it is sometimes mysterious how well this can work. In addition, we can then compute the

relevant parameters in a closed way and deduce their variation with the refractive indices.

This program is carried out in Section II for a single interface and in Section III for a

homogeneous slab. Finally, our conclusions are summarized in Section IV.

II. BEHAVIOR OF THE BREWSTER ANGLE AT AN INTERFACE

Let two homogeneous isotropic semi-inﬁnite dielectric media, described by real refractive

indices n0 and n1, be separated by a plane boundary. We assume an incident monochromatic,

linearly polarized plane wave from medium 0, which makes an angle θ0 with the normal to

the interface and has amplitude E(i). This wave splits into a reﬂected wave E(r) in medium

0, and a transmitted wave E(t) in medium 1 that makes an angle θ1 with the normal. The

angles of incidence θ0 and refraction θ1 are related by Snell’s law.

The wave vectors of all waves lie in the plane of incidence. When the incident ﬁelds are p or

s polarized, all plane waves excited by the incident ones have the same polarization, so both

3

basic polarizations can be treated separately. By demanding that the tangential components

of E and H should be continuous across the boundary, and assuming nonmagnetic media,

the reﬂection and transmission amplitudes are given by [1]

rs =

n1 cos θ1
n0 cos θ0 −
n0 cos θ0 + n1 cos θ1

rp =

.

These are the famous Fresnel formulas, represented in Fig. 1 and whose physical content is

discussed in any optics textbook. The Brewster angle occurs when rp = 0, which immediately

gives the condition

θB = tan−1 n,

(2.2)

where n = n1/n0 is the relative refractive index. Without loss of generality, in the rest of

this section we assume n0 = 1 and then n = n1. Also, we deal exclusively with p polarization

and drop the corresponding subscript everywhere.

To treat the reﬂectance

near the Brewster angle it proves convenient to use

R =

ϑ = θ0 −

θB,

which is the angle of incidence centered at θB. Since we are interested only in a local study,

we take into account only a small interval around θB; that is, angles from

∆ϑ to +∆ϑ.

−

The length of this interval is largely an arbitrary matter: we shall take henceforth ∆ϑ = 15◦,

although the analysis is largely independent of this choice.

(n1 = 1.75).

To quantify the peak near the Brewster angle, we treat the reﬂectance as a probability

distribution in the interval [

∆ϑ, +∆ϑ] and borrow some well-established concepts from

−

statistics [13]. In this manner we deﬁne

and, as it happens for ¯ϑ, they are functions of the refractive index n. The second moment

is a measure of the width of the distribution, while the third moment can be immediately

related with a lack of symmetry. More concretely, we take the width and the skewness of

the Brewster peak as

w = 2√µ2,

γ =

.

Of course, these parameters can be computed numerically by using the Fresnel formulas.

However, since we are working in a small neighborhood of θB, it seems more convenient

to work with some local approximation to r (and therefore to R). Here, we resort to Pad´e

approximants (to maintain the paper as self-contained as possible, in the Appendix we brieﬂy

recall the essentials of such an approach). After some calculations, the approximations to

the reﬂection coeﬃcient r turn out to be

only in a very small interval. The next polynomial approximation R[2/0] improves a little bit

the situation, but fails again as soon we are, say

10◦ away from θB. On the contrary, the

diagonal Pad´e R[1/1] ﬁts remarkably well with the exact behavior. We thus conclude that

R[1/1] provides an excellent approximation and we use it in subsequent calculations.

An additional and remarkable advantage of R[1/1] is that the central moments µk can be

expressed in a closed analytical form. In Fig. 3 we have plotted the width w as a function of

the refractive index n (lower curve). We have also computed w by numerically integrating

the Fresnel formulas: no appreciable diﬀerences can be noticed. The width has a maximum

that can be calculated by imposing dw/dn = 0, which immediately gives n = √3. Beyond

this value, w decreases almost linearly with n. However, for the range of indices plotted in

the ﬁgure, this variation is smooth, with a total change in w of around 3◦.

In Fig. 4 we have plotted the skewness γ in terms of n. This parameter is always negative

what, for a peak, means that the left tail is less pronounced than the right tail. There is

again a maximum in the skewness that can be calculated by imposing dγ/dn = 0. However,

one can check that µ3 ≃

1 for all the values of n, so that γ

coincides then with that of w. Apart from a scale factor, γ shows an aspect quite similar to

9

that of w.

III. BEHAVIOR OF THE BREWSTER ANGLE AT A SINGLE SLAB

We focus our attention now on a homogeneous, isotropic dielectric slab of refractive index

n and thickness d imbedded in air and illuminated with monochromatic light (the case when

the slab lies on a substrate can be dealt with much in the same way). A standard calculation

gives the following amplitude reﬂection coeﬃcient for the slab [15]

where r is the Fresnel reﬂection coeﬃcient at the interface air-medium (which again will be

considered for p polarization only) and β is the slab phase thickness

λ

Here d is the thickness, λ the wavelength in vacuo of the incident radiation and θ0 the angle

of incidence. This coeﬃcient R presents a typical periodic variation with the slab phase

thickness β. Apart from that dependence, it is obvious that R = 0 when r = 0; i. e.,

precisely at the Brewster angle for the interface air-medium. However, the form of this

reﬂectance peak, calculated now as

diﬀers from the case of a single interface, since (3.1) is more involved than (2.1). Although

the analysis can be carried out for any value of d such that R

= 0, for deﬁniteness and to

avoid as much as possible any spurious detail, we take d = λ/4. In Fig. 5 we have plotted the

Instead of Eq. (3.1), we use again a Pad´e approximant of order [1/1], which can be written

as

(3.6)

With this approximation, that still reproduces pretty well the exact reﬂectance, we have

analytically obtained w and γ for the slab. The results are plotted in the upper curves of

Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. For high values of n, the reﬂectance peak for the slab essentially

coincides with that for the interface. Diﬀerences are only noticeable for small values of n. In

fact, the maximum of w can be evaluated by imposing dw/dn = 0, whose numerical solution

gives n

1.45. The behavior of γ is quite similar, because here we have also that µ3 ≃ −
1

≃

for all the values of n.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have presented a simple and comprehensive treatment of the reﬂectance

near the Brewster angle. By combining the notions of width and skewness with Pad´e ap-

proximants, we have fully characterized this reﬂectance peak. We hope that these results

ﬁll a gap for a full understanding of the Brewster angle.

APPENDIX: PAD´E APPROXIMANTS

A Pad´e approximant is a rational function (of a speciﬁed order) such that its power series

expansion agrees with a given power series to the highest possible order. In other words, let

Nevertheless, experience shows that Eqs. (A6) are frequently close to singular, so that one

should solve them by e. g. a full pivotal lower-upper triangular (LU) decomposition [16].

By contrast with techniques like Chebyshev approximation or economization of power

series, that only condense the information that you already know about a function, Pad´e

approximants can give you genuinely new information about your function values [16]. We

conclude by noting that, for a ﬁxed value of L+M, the error is usually smallest when L = M

or when L = M + 1.

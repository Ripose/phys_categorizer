Narrow Spectral Response of a Brillouin Ampliﬁer

(February 21, 2014)

We investigate the spectral response of a Brillouin ampliﬁer in the frequency regime within the SBS bandwidth.
This is done by amplitude modulating the pump with a low frequency, and therefore, unlike previous studies, the
spectrum of the modulated pump is, in all cases, smaller than the SBS bandwidth. We show both theoretically
and experimentally that unlike phase modulation, which was reported in the literature, the amplitude modulation
increases the Brillouin ampliﬁer gain, and that this eﬀect has a very narrow bandwidth. Only modulation
frequencies that are lower than a certain cut-oﬀ frequency increase the gain. This cut-oﬀ frequency is inversely
proportional to the ﬁber’s length, and can therefore be arbitrarily small.

PACS: 42.65.Es

In long-distance optical communications in ﬁbers the
ﬁrst nonlinear eﬀect to appear is stimulated Brillouin
scattering (SBS). Many investigations over the past
decade have studied the inﬂuence of SBS on data trans-
mission, either to evaluate the induced degradation of the
optical signal or to utilize it for optical processing [1–4].
Clearly, the optical signal quality may be severely deteri-
orated due to SBS, since the signal experiences signiﬁcant
depletion over long distances. However, only a portion of
the signal’s spectrum is depleted. It is well known, that
the Brillouin process is characterized by a ﬁnite spectral
width, ΓB, which is related to the phonon lifetime in the
material (in glass ﬁbers, for example, ΓB/2π ∼= 20GHz).
Hence, every spectral component beyond the Brillouin
spectral width will not take part in the Brillouin process,
and will not be depleted.

Due to the practical importance of Brillouin scatter-
ing in long distance ﬁber communications, and its nega-
tive eﬀect on the transmitted optical signal, most of the
studies investigated the possibility of suppressing SBS. It
was determined that SBS could be almost entirely sup-
pressed by modulating the incident optical signal with
a frequency that exceeds tens of MHz [5,6]. Due to the
spectral width of the SBS, this is not a surprising ﬁnding.
Other works [7,8], which investigated the temporal re-
sponse to lower frequencies, usually employed square-
wave modulation (having a fast rise time), so that the
lower portion of the spectrum did not received enough
attention. There were however, some indications [9] that
the Brillouin ampliﬁer can react in a non-trivial manner
to modulation frequencies, which are considerably lower
than the SBS’s spectral width. Eskildsen and co work-
ers [9] showed that SBS can be substantially suppressed
by directly modulating a DFB laser with a frequency as
low as 5kHz. However, in their experiment, the exter-
nal low frequency modulation caused an extremely large

(much larger than the SBS spectral width) wavelength
dithering, i.e., a much larger broadening.

In this paper we investigate the spectral response of
the Brillouin ampliﬁer to modulation frequencies lower
than the SBS bandwidth. This is done by amplitude
modulating the pump with a low frequency, and there-
fore, unlike previous work [5,6,9], the spectrum of the
modulated pump is, in all cases, smaller than the SBS
bandwidth. We show both theoretically and experimen-
tally that unlike phase modulation, which was reported
in the literature, the amplitude modulation increases the
Brillouin ampliﬁer gain, and that this eﬀect has a very
narrow bandwidth. Only modulation frequencies, which
are lower than a certain cut-oﬀ frequency increases the
gain. This cut-oﬀ frequency value fc = c/2nL , which
depends only on the ﬁber’s length (L) and can be much
smaller than the Brillouin spectral width.

This solution suggests that the Brillouin eﬀect in the
ﬁber reacts to frequencies, which depend solely on the
ﬁber’s length. For long ﬁbers, these frequencies can be
considerably smaller than the Brillouin spectral width.

It should be noted, that this eﬀect is not neces-
sarily speciﬁc to the Brillouin process. Other nonlin-
ear, distributed optical ampliﬁers, when pumped by an
amplitude-modulated beam, will present a similar spec-
tral response. The reasoning behind this is as follows.
Since the ampliﬁcation is a nonlinear function of the
pump intensity, the impact of the temporal maxima and
minima of the modulated pump do not cancel each other;
the maxima have an excess gain (their gain increase is
larger than the gain decrease at the minima), and there-
fore the Stokes beam experiences a net increase in gain.
However, when the ﬁber length is larger than the mod-
ulation wavelength the eﬀective gain averaged over the
spatial maxima and minima converges to the unmodu-
lated gain value.

FIG. 1. Illustration of the system.

The experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1. Light from
a narrow-band (∼200kHz) laser (NetTest Tunics Plus) at
1550nm is split by a coupler. A portion is ampliﬁed by
an EDFA and sent into Fiber 1, to generate a Brillouin
Stokes beam with a bandwidth of about 30Mhz, which
is then guided into Fiber 2 as the seed for the Brillouin
ampliﬁer. The other portion is also ampliﬁed and then
modulated by a LiNbO3 electro-optic modulator, before
being sent into the other side of Fiber 2, to act as the
pump for the Brillouin ampliﬁer. The ampliﬁed Stokes
exits through the circulator.

both cases, the pump power entering Fiber 2 was approx-
imately 10mW, and the Stokes power was about three or-
ders of magnitude lower. The ampliﬁed Stokes consisted
of an ampliﬁed dc component as well as an ac component
due to the presence of the modulated pump. We mea-
sured the peak-to-peak amplitude of the ampliﬁed Stokes
as a function of the modulation frequency. The experi-

FIG. 3. The frequency response of the AC part of the am-

pliﬁed Stokes signal, where Fiber2 was 2km long.

For the 1km ampliﬁer, the cut-oﬀ frequency is 100 kHz,
and for the 2km ampliﬁer it is 50kHz, in perfect agree-
ment with theory.

In general, where the pump in eq.5 has a general
form I1 (z, t) it can always be separated into its Fourier
components I1 (z, t) = I1 (L)
df af cos [2πf (zn/c + t)].
Clearly, a generalization of 6 will still be valid, and, as
a consequence, only the low frequencies components will
contribute to the ampliﬁcation. We therefore conclude
that the Brillouin ampliﬁer can behave like a narrow
band ampliﬁer, whose cut-oﬀ frequency is inversely pro-
portional to its length, and can be considerably narrower
than the Brillouin spectral width.

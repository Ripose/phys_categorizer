Abstract

We study the effective susceptibility of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in colloidal crystals consider-

ing the local lattice effect using Edward-Kornfeld formulation, which are made of graded metallodielectric

nanoparticles with optical nonlinearity suspended in a host ﬂuid. We ﬁnd a large enhancement and red-

shift of optical nonlinearity, which arises from the periodic structure, local ﬁeld effects and gradation in the

metallic cores.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, nonlinear composite materials with high order nonlinear optical susceptibility

or large optical ﬁgure of merit have drawn considerable attention for its potential application in

bistable switches and optical correlators [1, 2, 3, 4]. With the advancements in nanotechnology,

such as templated sedimentation and dielectrophoresis [5, 6, 7, 8], it is possible to fabricate par-

ticles with speciﬁc geometry. It has been reported [2, 4, 9, 10] that graded composite material

whose physical properties vary gradually in space, shows stronger nonlinear optical response than

the homogenous one, so it has various engineering applications.

Colloidal crystal has been widely studied in nanomaterials and has potential applications in

nanophotonics and biomedicine [26]. To form the gradient of dielectric constant, it is desirable

to use metallic nanoparticles with dielectric materials coated outside, and the thickness varies in

the shell, the optical effects of graded material are affected and enhanced by local ﬁeld effects due

to its inhomogeneity. A great number of theories and experiments have reported [11, 12, 13, 14]

the physical and biological properties of colloid crystal-graded sphere model, like biological cells

and liquid crystal droplets. In this paper, we will consider an ideal system with homogenous pe-

riodic structure as its host medium, the nanoparticles are graded material with a dielectric surface

layer as its nanoshell. The local ﬁelds in the colloidal crystal structure can be treated as dipolar

and quadrupolar arrays in the form of Gaussian distribution (Ewald-Kornfeld formulation [15]).

We focus on the possibility of offering high χ graded crystal with higher harmonic generations.

Second harmonic generation(SHG) is an all-optical effect in which two photons with frequency

ω are converted parametrically into a sum frequency photon with a frequency 2ω. SHG and the

characterizations of phase transformation behavior can be detected in many nanocrystals using

either classical ways as X-ray diffraction or Raman spectroscopy [25], especially in tetragonal

phase. Until now, achieving enhanced second-harmonic generation is a challenge [16, 17]. In this

paper, we shall investigate second-order optical susceptibility of SHG in the colloidal crystals by

invoking the nonlinear differential effective dipole approximation (NDEDA) method [18, 19]. The

SHG effect, like the third-order Kerr-type coefﬁcient, involves the nonlinear susceptibilities of the

constituents and local ﬁeld enhancement which arise from the structure of host medium. For ex-

ample, Hui et al. studied a dilute suspension of coated particles with the shell having a nonlinear

susceptibility for second harmonic generation [24].

This paper is organized as follows. In section II, we apply the Ewald-Konrnfeld formulation

2

to derive the local electric ﬁeld in three typical structures of colloid crystals, and then perform

the NDEDA method to extract the effective linear dielectric constant and SHG susceptibility. In

Section III, we numerically investigate the harmonics under different conditions, which is followed

by discussion and conclusion in Section IV.

II. FORMALISM

We consider a graded metallic core with radius a, with the radial gradation proﬁle. When we

consider quadradic nonlinearities only, the local constitutive relation between the displacement
ﬁeld D(r) and the electric ﬁeld E(r) in the static case is given by [28, 29, 30]

Di(r) =

ǫijEj(r) +

χijk(r)Ej(r)Ek(r), i = x, y, z,

(1)

Xj

Xjk

where Di(r) and Ei(r) are the ith component of D(r) and E(r), respectively, and χijk is the

SHG susceptibility. Here ǫij = ǫ(r)δij denotes the linear dielectric constant, which is assumed

for simplicity to be isotropic. Both ǫ(r) and χijk(r) are functions of r, as a result of the gradation

proﬁle along the radius.

If a monochromatic external ﬁeld is applied, the nonlinearity in the

system will generally generate local potentials and ﬁelds at all harmonic frequencies. For a ﬁnite

frequency external electric ﬁeld of the form

E0 = E0(ω)e−iωt + c.c.,

(2)

the effective SHG susceptibility χ2ω can be extracted by considering the volume average of the

displacement ﬁeld at the frequency 2ω in the inhomogeneous medium [10, 27, 28, 29, 30].The

graded metallic core can be built up by adding shells gradually, making the dielectric constant

ǫ1(r)(r

≤

a) a radial function., which is shown in Fig. 1.Assuming both the dielectric constant

of the surface and the linear host ﬂuid is independent of the radius for convenience, we set them

equal. At radius r, the inhomogeneous spherical particle with ǫ(r) and χ2w(r) can have the same

dipole moment effect as the homogenous sphere with ¯ǫ(r) and ¯χ2w(r). Their relationship can be

obtained from NDEDA method [18], taking the limit dr

¯ǫ(r + dr), and χ2w(r) can be written in a differential form for SHG generation [31]

graded spherical particle with radius r and ¯χ2ω(r) denotes the equivalent SHG susceptibility of the

whole graded spherical particle with radius r, while χ2ω denotes the effective SHG susceptibility

of the whole system.

The above two equations can be solved using numerical simulations. For obtaining the effective

dielectric constant of the colloidal crystal, we refer to the well-known Maxwell-Garnett formula

[21] with a high degree of accuracy due to the explicit determination of local ﬁeld factor α:

The local ﬁeld factor α can be solved by applying Ewald-Korneld formulation. Below we apply the

Ewald-Korneld model to compute the local electric ﬁeld for a tetragonal unit cell. The lattice effect

can derive the local electric ﬁelds and induced dipole moments in ER(MR or inverse ferroﬂuids)

solid, which is subjected to a structure transformation due to external ﬁeld.It can be viewed as

a tetragonal lattice plus a basis of two point dipoles. One of the two nanoparticles is located at

the corner of the cell, and the other is at the body center. Without loss of generality, we consider

three representative lattices: the bct (body-centered tetragonal), bcc (body-centered cubic) and fcc

(face-centered cubic) lattice. If the uniaxial anisotropic axis is directed along the axis, the lattice

constants can be denoted by C1(C2 = ℓq−
parameters satisfy the geometric constraint that C 2

2 ) along ~x (~y) axis and C3 = ℓq along ~z axis. The lattice
3 = 16(a + d)2, when we take into
account of the dielectric surface layer with thickness d on the graded metallic core(a is the radius of

2 + C 2

1 + C 2

the metallic core). It is easy to obtain the value of q from their intrinsic structures: q = 0.87358, 1.0

1

and 2

3 represent the bct, bcc and fcc lattice respectively. The degree of anisotropy of periodic

4

lattice is measured by how q deviates from unity. Here we assume that the colloidal particles are

packed closely together, which can be a good approximation with most realistic colloidal system.

Meanwhile, we obtain a relation between q and the volume fraction p of the metallic component,

p = [π/(24t3)]

[(q3 + 2)/q]

2 , with thickness parameter t = (a + d)/a, t > 1. The lattice vector

3

of the tetragonal lattice is given by R = ℓ(q−
2 mˆy + qnˆz) where l, m, n are integers.
When an external electric ﬁeld E0 is applied along the ~x axis, the induced dipole moment P

are perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis.

It should be noted that due to the different

polarization of the incident light, the longitudinal and transverse local ﬁeld have two independent

ﬁeld orientation factors, in terms of α⊥ and αk. Thus the effective dielectric constant ǫe also needs

to be indicated in longitudinal and transverse ﬁeld case. In the uniaxial crystal, α⊥ and αk satisfy

the sum rule 2α⊥ + αk = 3 [22, 23]. Considering the ﬁeld contribution from all other particles in
the lattice, the local ﬁeld EL at the lattice point ~r = 0 can be given as:

B(r) = erfc(ηr)/r3 +

2η/(√πr2) exp(

η2r2)) and C(r) = 3erfc(ηr)/r5 + 4η3/(√πr2) + 6η/(√πr4) exp(

η2r2),

where erfc(ηr) is the complementary error function and η is an adjustable parameter making the

summation converge rapidly. G denotes the reciprocal lattice vector of R. Thus the local ﬁeld

factor in transverse mode can be deﬁned as α⊥ = 3VcEL/4πp. For the bct, bcc and fcc lattices,
we obtain α⊥ = 0.95351, 1.0 and 1.0 respectively. Now we consider the electric ﬁeld E0 and
displacement ﬁeld D(E) inside the graded spheres, in which second-harmonic D(E) can be ex-

panded at frequency 2ω when the ﬁeld is applied along ~z axis. Then following from [24], the

effective SHG susceptibility χ2ω is given by

where Elin represents the equivalent linear local electric ﬁeld in the graded metallic core. It can

be obtained from [20]

Meanwhile, ¯χ2ω can be obtained through the NDEDA method. For focusing on the enhancement

of the SHG response, we consider the intrinsic third order nonlinear susceptibility χ1 is a positive

frequency and position independent constant, while the nonlinear SHG susceptibility ¯χ2ω still

depend on r [18]. Then, we consider the nonlinear metal and compositionally graded material.

The metallic core is assumed to be the Drude form, whose linear dielectric constant admits

ǫ(r) = 1

(11)

with a model plasma-frequency gradation proﬁle ωp(r) = ωp(0)(1

Cωr/a). The optimal nonlin-

−

ear response needs a large gradient dielectric function, which can be achieved by adding different

metallic layers constituting the core.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

Figure 2 shows the imaginary parts of the effective linear dielectric constant, the real and imag-

inary parts of the effective SHG susceptibility and the ﬁgure of merit versus the function of fre-

quency for longitudinal ﬁeld cases. Also it shows the modulus of ¯χ2w/χ1. We choose Cγ = 0 as

the dielectric function gradation considering nongraded relaxation time. The strength of the non-

linear polarization of nonlinear materials is reﬂected by the magnitude of the high-order harmonics

of local electric ﬁeld. As Cω increases, ωp(r) take on a broader range of value and leads to a broad

plasmon band, while the plasmon peak redshifts to lower frequencies. Third-order susceptibility

of the SHG also shows an enhancement and shift to the lower freuency. And the range of the SHG

susceptibility and FOM increases with the increase of Cω.

Figure 3 shows the effective SHG susceptibility constant and FOM as a function of thickness

parameter t. For a given lattice it is evident that the effective linear and SHG susceptibility re-

sponses strongly depend on the thickness parameter. Both the redshift and strength of the plasma

resonant peak or band are largest at the smallest t for linear dielectric case, while for SHG sus-

ceptibility case they are at the biggest t . This is the combination of nonuniform distribution of

the local ﬁeld and high order susceptibility effect. In fact, the volume fraction for different col-

loidal lattices also contributes to the nature of plasma resonant. For the fcc lattice, the redshift lies

between bct and bcc lattice, but they have only slight difference (no pictures shown here). This

structure transformation can be detected in experiment. It can also be found that as t increases

(alternatively the colloid crystal become dilute), the behavior of plasma resonant become more

6

similar. This can be explained from the dilute limit approximation model for the enhancement of

optical susceptibility. In Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 the quantities that can be both positive and negative are

plotted in a logarithm of modulus. When the quantities pass through zero, the logarithm is very

large, thus yielding spikes. In addition, we can reach the conclusion from the ﬁgures of FOM in

the high frequency region is still attractive for the presence of weak optical absorption.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

As a matter of fact, it should be straightforward to investigate the higher order susceptibility

(e.g. THG effect). However in experiment it will be easier to get the second-order harmonic by

the coupling between the AC and DC external ﬁelds and is several orders of magnitude larger

than higher order. Finally, this work can be extended to ER ﬂuid where the susceptibility of

particles can have a distribution and the host material can possess anisotropic geometry. While by

measuring the nonlinear AC responses of ER ﬂuid, it can also be possible to perform a real-time

study of structure transformations and ﬁlm growth. On the other hand, as the value of q increases,

the responses in transverse ﬁeld will have slight difference from the longitudinal case (no pictures

shown here), because of the little difference between α⊥ and αk for a given structure. From bct,

bcc to fcc lattice, with the increase of q , the longitudial local ﬁeld factor αk decreases from 1.09

at bct lattice to 1.0 at bcc and fcc lattice, while the volume fraction p decreases to bct and bcc,

then increases to fcc. This trend can also be seen in other bulk sample, such as rhomboedral,

orthorhombic and hexagonal.

In summary, we theoretically exploit a class of nonlinear materials possessing nonvanishing

SHG susceptibility. The materials are based on colloidal crystals of graded metallodielectric

nanoparticles, which have an enhancement and redshift of optical nonlinearity, arising from the

periodic structure, local ﬁeld effect and metallic core gradation.

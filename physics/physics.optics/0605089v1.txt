A class of multiwavelength Fabry-P´erot lasers is introduced where the spectrum is tailored through
a non-periodic patterning of the cavity eﬀective index. The cavity geometry is obtained using an
inverse scattering approach and can be designed such that the spacing of discrete Fabry-P´erot
lasing modes is limited only by the bandwidth of the inverted gain medium. A speciﬁc two-color
semiconductor laser with a mode spacing in the THz regime is designed, and measurements are
presented demonstrating the simultaneous oscillation of the two wavelengths. The extension of the
Fabry-P´erot laser concept described presents signiﬁcant new possibilities in laser cavity design.

PACS numbers: 42.55.Px, 42.60.Da, 85.60.Bt

The most familiar laser cavity geometry is the Fabry-
P´erot (FP) laser, which comprises an active gain medium
and two external mirrors providing feedback for oscil-
lation.
In this geometry the longitudinal lasing mode
wavelengths are determined by the half wave resonance
condition: λm = 2nLc/m, where m = 1, 2, ..., λm is the
free space wavelength of the mth mode, Lc is the cavity
length, and n is the cavity refractive index [1].

A fundamental limitation of the basic FP geometry
is the lack of any frequency selectivity other than that
provided by the gain medium. Because the gain band-
width is much larger than the FP mode spacing in typical
semiconductor lasers, more complex laser cavity geome-
tries have been conceived in order to control and manip-
ulate semiconductor laser spectra. For example, one di-
mensional systems such as the distributed feedback laser
provide high spectral purity and temperature stability
in device applications [2]. Translational symmetry deter-
mines the lasing modes of this structure without the need
for a reﬂection from external mirrors.

If we consider the interaction of the cavity modes with
the gain medium, the semiconductor FP laser geometry is
deceptively simple. In a perfectly homogeneously broad-
ened medium, a single lasing mode should always dom-
inate [3, 4]. When driven above threshold, semiconduc-
tor FP lasers often oscillate in many modes. This mul-
timode behaviour is characteristic of inhomogeneously
broadened gain media, despite the fact that in a semicon-
ductor the carriers are distributed in continuous bands.
A key property of the FP laser in this respect is the
fact that all the cavity resonant wavevectors are equally
spaced. As a result, four-wave mixing (FWM) interac-
tions, which transfer power among modes, are cavity en-
hanced.
In addition, carrier density pulsations at the
intermode frequencies and the ﬁnite alpha factor lead to
an asymmetric contribution to the nonlinear gain in semi-
conductor lasers [5, 6, 7]. Along with the large sponta-
neous emission rate in semiconductor lasers, this inter-
action also promotes multimode oscillation and can lead

to mode hopping and complex antiphased switching dy-
namics [8, 9].

In this letter we revisit and extend the basic FP laser
geometry. We demonstrate that multiwavelength FP
lasers can be designed where, apart from the constraint
imposed by the half wave resonance requirement, the dis-
tribution of lasing modes is chosen independent of the
cavity length. The basic FP cavity conﬁguration and
mode structure are maintained, with the manipulation of
the lasing mode spectrum achieved using a non-periodic
eﬀective index proﬁle. The precise geometry is deter-
mined from the desired lasing spectrum through an in-
verse scattering approach [10, 11].

Because of its fundamental signiﬁcance, we present ex-
perimental measurements of a two-color semiconductor
FP laser with a primary mode spacing in the THz regime.
Our measurements demonstrate that the device oscillates
simultaneously on two discrete FP modes, and without
the requirement for an external cavity arrangement or
other external perturbation. In contrast to this ideal be-
haviour associated with weakly coupled modes, an other-
wise identical plain FP laser, with a modal spacing deter-
mined by the cavity length, displays the mode hopping
behaviour and complex dynamics associated with strong
mode competition.

Consider the one-dimensional model of the FP cavity
geometry represented in Fig. 1. The system comprises a
FP cavity of length Lc with a spatially varying refractive
index. The mirror reﬂectivities are r1 and r2 (assumed
real for simplicity) and there are N additional index steps
along the cavity. For each section of the laser cavity (in-
dex i) we deﬁne θi = nik0zLi, where k0z is the free space
wavenumber along z and Li and ni are the length and
the eﬀective refractive index of the ith section respec-
tively. The adjusted complex optical path length across

where the quantities φ−j and φ+

lengths from the centre of each additional feature to the
left and right facets respectively.

If we neglect a factor describing the background losses
associated with each mode, for a vanishing index step,
the threshold gain for lasing is determined by the mirror
losses. We have γ(0)

The inverse problem at ﬁrst order is solved by choos-
ing a particular cavity resonance, m0, as an origin in
wavenumber space. We assume quarter wave features
with sin θ
2j = 1 in order that the intensity scattered by
each feature at the wavelength of mode m0 is maximized.
Each feature is placed ultimately such that a half wave-
length subcavity at the wavelength of mode m0 is formed
between the feature and one of the external mirrors. The
threshold gain can then be expressed at each resonance,
m + (∆n/n)γ(1)

Using Eqn.

3 Fourier analysis can be used in or-
der to build up a particular threshold gain modulation
in wavenumber space. Because it represents the sim-
plest system that illustrates the application of classi-
cal multimode laser theory [12], the multiwavelength de-
vice we describe here is the two-color laser. The appro-
priate basis for this device is a pair of sinc functions,
γm ∼ sinc(∆m + a/2) + sinc(∆m − a/2). This choice
selects two modes, centered at m0 and with spacing a
modes, while leaving the other FP modes unperturbed.
In the inset of Fig. 2 (a) we have plotted an idealized
threshold gain spectrum where the primary mode spacing
is a = 4 fundamental cavity modes. The Fourier trans-
form of our idealized threshold gain modulation function
is cos(πaǫ), for −1/2 ≤ ǫ ≤ 1/2 and is zero otherwise.

The factor A(ǫj) in Eqn. 3 reﬂects the fact that the
change in threshold of a given mode is determined by the
diﬀerence in the round-trip amplitude gain to the left and
to the right of each feature. To determine the appropri-
ate distribution of features, we must therefore correct for
the variation of the amplitude of the threshold modula-
tion with position. We take the product of the Fourier
transform of our ideal threshold gain modulation with the
1. The absolute value of this
envelope function, [A(ǫj)]−
product determines the feature density function shown
in Fig. 2 (a), which we then sample in order to approx-
imately reproduce the idealized threshold gain spectrum
[10].

For the two-color device considered the cavity is asym-
metric with one larger facet reﬂectivity (r1). This allows
a more uniform density of features along one side of the
device center. Once the feature density function is sam-
pled correctly, feature positions are adjusted in order to
satisfy the correct phase requirement for resonance. A
schematic picture of the device, high-reﬂection coated as
indicated, is shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2. With
respect to the lasing wavelength of mode m0 in the cav-
ity, where cos(πaǫj) > 0, the phase requirement corre-
sponds to forming a halfwave resonant subcavity between
the corresponding feature and the high-reﬂection coated
mirror. For cos(πaǫj) < 0, we form a quarterwave sub-
cavity at the same wavelength. In this way, at each zero
of the feature density function a π/2 phase shift is in-
troduced into the index pattern along the device length.
Optical path corrections due to the introduction of the
features must also be accounted for when the ﬁnal fea-
ture positions are calculated. The calculated form of the
threshold gain spectrum is shown in Fig. 2 (b) and is an
excellent approximation of the ideal form. To appreciate
the simplicity of this approach, it is important to note

that the device comprises a single, patterned amplifying
section with both external mirrors necessary to form the
FP mode structure. Thus, unlike distributed feedback
approaches, the role of the inhomogeneous cavity eﬀec-
tive index is simply to discriminate between the various
FP modes.

We now present experimental measurements of a
ridge waveguide FP laser fabricated to the design de-
picted in Fig. 2. The device is a multi-quantum well
InP/InGaAlAs laser of length 350 µm with a peak emis-
sion near 1.3µm. The additional features are slotted re-
gions etched into the laser ridge waveguide. This tech-
nique is based on standard optical lithography and does
not require a regrowth step. The laser was temperature
stabilised at 250C to ±0.010C and a constant current was
applied to the device. Laser emission was spectrally re-
solved using an optical spectrum analyser with 0.01 nm
resolution.

A series of spectra of the device of Fig. 2 are shown
in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 (a) shows the device spectrum below
threshold. One can see that the two primary modes are
already selected in this regime. Note the good agreement
with the calculation shown in Fig. 2, with the two pri-
mary modes separated by four fundamental FP modes.
As the current is increased the mode on the short wave-
length side reaches threshold ﬁrst (Fig. 3 (b)) and as
the current is increased further thermal eﬀects lead to
the peak power shifting across the primary mode spac-
ing to the long wavelength side (Fig. 3 (c)). The lasing
spectrum at 43.5 mA is shown in Fig. 3 (d). At this
current the time averaged optical power in the primary
modes is approximately equal. For comparison, an above

In Fig. 4 (a) we have plotted a higher resolution pic-
ture of part of the spectrum of Fig. 3 (d). One can
see sideband formation due to four wave mixing (FWM)
processes in the cavity. FWM is a third order nonlinear
process which occurs due to the formation of a dynamic
grating in the material complex index [13, 14]. The grat-
ing is formed through the beating of the primary modes
at ν1 and ν2 as shown in Fig. 3 (d). The sideband shown
appears at a frequency of 2ν1 − ν2 with the scattering
of the primary mode at ν1 by the grating. Within the
bandwidth of the inverted semiconductor, the patterned
FP cavity naturally provides gain and resonant feedback
for the FWM sideband, which is slightly detuned from
the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission peak due to the ma-
terial dispersion and is resonantly enhanced as the two
primary modes attain equal time averaged intensity. The
presence of a large, narrow linewidth signal, implies that
the two modes are oscillating simultaneously with good
phase stability.

Phase coherence of the primary modes implies an ultra-
fast intensity modulation of the laser output. We mea-
sured this mode beating in the cw output of the laser
at the diﬀerence frequency, ν2 − ν1 ∼ 480 GHz. The
result of the background free intensity autocorrelation
measurement is shown in the inset of Fig. 4 (a) where
the contrast ratio observed is close to the theoretical limit
of 3:1. In the mode locking regime, the extension of con-
cepts described here to create a comb of discrete wave-
lengths can lead to compact sources of pulsed radiation
with THz repetition rates. In fact, the polarization asso-
ciated with the mode beating itself is a source of direct
THz radiation, generated by the two primary waves in
an intracavity process [15]. In an intracavity process a
single material system simultaneously acts as the pump
medium and nonlinear mixing material. Such systems
have received considerable interest on account of their

potential to enhance nonlinear interactions. Approaches
to intracavity wavemixing have tended to focus on engi-
neering of the semiconductor heterostructure to support
distinct optical transitions and thus multiple lasing wave-
lengths [16, 17]. By using the extension of the FP cavity
concept described here to suppress unwanted longitudinal
cavity mode structure, the eﬃciency of such approaches
can be further improved.

We now apply the classical theory of a homogeneously
broadened two mode laser to our device near the current
of Fig. 3 (d). In classical laser theory, simultaneous las-
ing of two modes is possible if the net gain of each mode
is positive and the competition due to cross-saturation is
suﬃciently weakened by a large mode spacing and by the
spatial hole burning eﬀect associated with the standing
waves of the FP cavity [12].

Measurement of a large intensity modulation at the dif-
ference frequency of the two modes indicates that the de-
vice is not exhibiting the mode hopping behaviour char-
acteristic of multiwavelength semiconductor lasers with
strongly coupled lasing modes [18]. We conﬁrmed this by
measurements of time traces of the modal and total in-
tensity output of the two-color device as shown in Fig. 4
(b). We observe an essentially constant total output and
anticorrelated, enhanced intensity noise traces in each of
the two primary modes due to mode partition (a sin-
gle modal intensity time trace is shown for clarity) [19].
The plain FP laser of Fig. 3 (e) also shows a constant
total intensity, but analysis of individual modal intensi-
ties reveals complex dynamics including mode hopping
behaviour, an example of which is shown in Fig. 4 (c).
This ﬁgure shows a sequence of spontaneous switching
events where the longitudinal mode in question switches
between an “on” state with large intensity to an “oﬀ”

4

state with an intensity close to zero.

In the two-color device here, the coupling between
the primary modes is determined by various processes
that have diﬀerent strengths depending on the separa-
tion between the modes. These include static spectral
hole burning, intraband population pulsations and car-
rier density pulsations. Because the characteristic time
associated with interband processes is large, the con-
tribution of asymmetric nonlinear gain due to the in-
terband carrier density pulsations will be much smaller
in the two-color device, where the separation between
modes is large. If we neglect the asymmetric contribu-
tion, weak coupling of modes in the two-color device re-
quires (4/3)·[1+(ω1−ω2)2τ 2

in]−
and τin is the intraband relaxation time [7]. An estimated
range of values for τin is 100 - 200 fs, which determines
a minimum spacing for the two modes of 460-920 GHz.
Although this estimate is in agreement with the actual
modal separation and stability properties observed, a sys-
tematic study of two-color and other multiwavelength FP
lasers will be of interest in order to understand separately
the roles of the primary mode spacing and the total mode
number in determining the stability and dynamical prop-
erties of this family of devices.

In conclusion, we have introduced a class of multiwave-
length Fabry-P´erot lasers where the number and spacing
of the lasing modes is limited only by the bandwidth of
the active medium. Measurements of simultaneous las-
ing in a specially designed two-color Fabry-P´erot cavity
geometry with THz mode spacing were presented. The
inverse scattering approach to multiwavelength laser de-
sign described is likely to open up new avenues for the
fundamental studies of semiconductor laser stability and
dynamics.
In addition, the devices can provide inter-
esting and novel solutions to many applied problems in
optoelectronics and nonlinear optics.

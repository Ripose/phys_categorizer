Abstract. Attempts to quantize light in a manifestly Lorentz covariant manner fail because of the indeﬁnite
metric problem. Here an error in the interpretation is uncovered that is at the root of this problem.

1 Problem

The manifestly covariant approach to the quantisation of
electrodynamics interpretes Aµ and Aµ+ as photon anni-
hilation and creation operators with commutation relation
[1]

[Aµ(k), A+ν (k′

)] = gµν δ(k − k′

).

(1)

A single photon state with polarization µ and momentum
k is constructed by operating A+µ(k) on the vacuum state
|0 >. The in-product of two single photon states is

< 0|Aµ(k)A+ν (k′

)|0 > = < 0|[Aµ(k), A+ν (k′
= gµνδ(k − k′

)

)]|0 >

(2)

For µ = ν = 0 this is a negative deﬁnite quantity which
invalidates Eq. 2 as a normalization condition and is in-
consistent with the interpretation of A+µ(k)|0 > as a
single time-like photon state. In-depth discussions of this
problem are given in Refs. [2,3]. Ref. [3] even uses a non-
covariant approach throughout the text because of this
issue.

2 Solution

First the meaning of the notation Aµ must be clariﬁed. It
may denote the µ-component of a Minkovski vector, that
is, a number. The same symbol also denotes a Minkovski
vector polarized along the µ direction.

It is an improvement to write A(µ) for the vector, but
the notation must also distinguish a contravariant vector
with components A(µ)λ from a covariant one with com-
ponents A(µ)
λ . The polarization can also be along the con-
travariant µ-direction, in which case one should write Aλ
(µ)
or A(µ)λ.

In the proposed notation a single photon state is ei-
ther the contravariant A+(µ)λ(k)|0 > or the covariant
A+(µ)
(k)|0 >. The crucial question is: which bra state
λ
belongs to this ket state? In Eq. 2 covariant bra states are

combined with contravariant ket states, or vice versa. By
this choice the infamous minus sign is tacitly introduced.
A positive deﬁnite norm is obtained by combining the
contravariant ket state, A+(µ)λ(k)|0 >, with the again
contravariant bra state < 0|A(µ)λ(k), or, likewise, by com-
bining covariant bra and ket states. This norm is

< 0|A(µ)λ(k)A+(ν)λ(k′

)|0 >,

It takes the covariant form gµ

(µ)λ.

ν δ(k − k′), because A+(µ)λ =

3 Conclusion

The indeﬁnite metric problem is merely a confusion caused
by ambiguous notation. The covariant quantization proce-
dure is physically sound after all. It is perhaps surprising
that the fundaments of ﬁeld theory are still subject to
improvement.

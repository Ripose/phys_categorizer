We study the accuracy of determining the phase space quasidistribution of a single quantized
light mode by a photon counting experiment. We derive an exact analytical formula for the error
of the experimental outcome. This result provides an estimation for the experimental parameters,
such as the number of events, required to determine the quasidistribution with assumed precision.
Our analysis also shows that it is in general not possible to compensate the imperfectness of the
photodetector in a numerical processing of the experimental data. The discussion is illustrated with
Monte Carlo simulations of the photon counting experiment for the coherent state, the one photon
Fock state, and the Schr¨odinger cat state.

I. INTRODUCTION

Generation and detection of simple quantum systems
exhibiting nonclassical features have been, over the past
few years, a subject of numerous experimental and the-
oretical studies. Quantum optics, provides in a natural
way, several interesting examples of nonclassical systems
along with practical tools to perform measurements. One
of the simplest systems is a single quantized light mode,
whose Wigner function has been measured in a series of
beautiful experiments using optical homodyne tomogra-
phy [1,2] following a theoretical proposal [3].

Recently, a novel method for the determination of the
Wigner function of a light mode has been proposed [4,5].
This method utilizes a direct relation between the pho-
tocount statistics and the phase space quasidistributions
of light. Simplicity of this relation makes it possible to
probe independently each point of the single mode phase
space. In a very recent experiment, an analogous method
has been used to measure the Wigner function of the mo-
tional state of a trapped ion [6].

In the present paper we supplement the description
of this method with a rigorous analysis of the statisti-
cal uncertainty, when the phase space quasidistribution
is determined from a ﬁnite sample of measurements. The
analysis of the reconstruction errors due, for example, to
a ﬁnite set of recorded photons is essential in designing
an experiment that can provide accurate reconstruction
of the phase space quasidistribution. We will derive an-
alytical formulae for the uncertainty of the experimen-
tal result, which give theoretical control over the poten-
tial sources of errors. Additional motivation for these
studies comes from recent discussions of the possibility
of compensating the detector losses in quantum optical
measurements [7,8]. Our analysis will provide a detailed
answer to the question whether such a compensation is
possible in the newly proposed scheme.

This paper is organized as follows. First, in Sec. II we

brieﬂy review properties of the quasidistribution func-
tions that are relevant to the further parts of the pa-
per. Then, in order to make the paper self–contained,
we present the essentials of the method in Sec. III. Next
we derive and discuss the statistical error of the exper-
imentally determined quasidistribution in Sec. IV. The
general results are illustrated with several examples in
Sec. V. Finally, Sec. VI summarizes the paper.

II. QUASIDISTRIBUTIONS OF A SINGLE
LIGHT MODE

The phase space representation of the state of a sin-
gle quantized light mode as a function, of one complex
variable β, has been extensively used in quantum op-
tics since its very beginning. Due to the noncommuta-
tivity of the boson creation and annihilation operators,
the Wigner function is just an example of the more gen-
eral t-parameterized quasiprobability distributions. Such
a one–parameter family of quasidistribution functions is
given by the following formula [9]:

1

Z

W (β; t) =

d2ξ et|ξ|

2

/2+ξ∗β−ξβ∗

eξˆa†−ξ∗ˆa

,

(1)

D

E

where ˆa and ˆa† are the single mode photon annihila-
tion and creation operators, and the real parameter t
deﬁnes the corresponding phase space distribution.
It
is well known that such a parameter is associated with
the ordering of the ﬁeld bosonic operators. For example,
t = 1, 0, and
1 correspond to the normal, symmetric
and antinormal ordering, respectively. The correspond-
ing quasidistributions are: the P function, the Wigner
function, and the Q function. The properties of the
t-parameterized quasiprobability distributions are quite
diﬀerent. For example: the P function is highly singular
for nonclassical states of light, the Wigner function is well

−

1

behaved for all states, but may take negative values, and
ﬁnally the Q function is always positive deﬁnite. These
properties reﬂect a general relation linking any two dif-
ferently ordered quasidistributions via convolution with
a Gaussian function in the complex phase space:

are not easily visible.

Fig. 1 shows this quasidistribution plotted for three dif-
ferent values of the ordering parameter t. The Wigner
function contains an oscillating component originating
from the interference between the coherent states. This
component is completely smeared out in the Q function,
which can hardly be distinguished from that of a statis-
tical mixture of two coherent states.

Computation of a higher ordered quasidistribution
from a given one is not a straightforward task, since the
integral in Eq. (2) fails to converge for t′ > t. Instead, a
relation linking the Fourier transforms of the quasidistri-
butions can be used in analytical calculations:

˜W (ξ; t′) = exp[(t′

ξ
t)
|

2/2] ˜W (ξ, t).
|

−

(5)

However, its application in the processing of experimen-
tal data would enormously amplify the statistical error
[11]. Consequently, in the case of experimentally deter-
mined functions it is practically impossible to compute a
higher ordered quasidistribution from the measured one.
Therefore the ordering of the measured quasidistribution
depends primarily on the features of a speciﬁc experimen-
tal scheme. Optical homodyne tomography is capable of
measuring the Wigner function, provided that the detec-
tion is lossless. For heterodyne [12] and double homodyne
[13] detection schemes the Q function is the limit, because
in these methods an additional noise is introduced by a
vacuum mode mixed with the detected ﬁelds.

In our calculations a normally ordered representation
of the quasidistribution functions will be very useful. In-
troducing normal ordering of the creation and annihila-
tion operators in Eq. (1) allows to perform the integral
explicitly, which yields:

showing that for t
0 the quasidistribution is an ex-
pectation value of a bounded operator and therefore is
well behaved. Of course, only well behaved, nonsingular
functions have experimental signiﬁcance.

III. PHOTOCOUNT STATISTICS AND
QUASIDISTRIBUTIONS

The experimental setup proposed to determine the
quasiprobability distribution via photon counting is pre-
sented in Fig. 2. The signal, characterized by an annihi-
lation operator ˆa is superposed by a beam splitter on a
probe ﬁeld prepared in a coherent state
. The mea-
α
i
|
surement is performed only on one of the output ports
of the beam splitter, delivering the transmitted signal
mixed with the reﬂected probe ﬁeld. The quantity de-
tected on this port is simply the photon statistics, mea-
sured with the help of a single photodetector. We will
consider an imperfect detector, described by a quantum
eﬃciency η. According to the quantum theory of pho-
todetection, the probability pn of registering n counts
by the detector is given by the expectation value of the
following normally ordered operator:

pn =

(8)

where the angular brackets denote the quantum expecta-
tion value and ˆ
Jout is the operator of the time–integrated
ﬂux of the light incident onto the surface of the detector.
It can be expressed in terms of the signal and probe ﬁelds
as

with T being the beam splitter power transmission. The
count statistics determined in the experiment is used to

where s is a real parameter, which will allow us to ma-
nipulate to some extent the ordering of the measured
phase space quasidistribution. We will specify the al-
lowed range of the parameter s later. A comparison of
the latter form of the PCGF with Eq. (6) shows that it
is directly related to a speciﬁcally ordered quasidistribu-
tion of the signal ﬁeld. After the identiﬁcation of the
parameters we obtain that the PCGF can be written as:

Thus the PCGF computed from the count statistics is
proportional to the value of the signal quasiprobability
distribution at the point β =
T )/T α, determined
by the amplitude and the phase of the probe coherent
ﬁeld [15]. We may therefore scan the whole phase space
of the signal ﬁeld by changing the parameters of the probe
ﬁeld. The main advantage of this scheme is that the mea-
surement of the quasidistribution is performed indepen-
dently at each point of the phase space. In contrast to
optical homodyne tomography there is no need to gather
ﬁrst the complete set of experimental data and then pro-
cess it numerically.

The ordering of the measured quasidistribution de-
pends on two quantities: the parameter s used in the
construction of the PCGF from the count statistics, and
the product of the beam splitter transmission T and the
detector eﬃciency η. Let us ﬁrst consider the case of
an ideal detector η = 1 and the transmission tending to
one. In this limit the ordering of the quasidistribution
approaches s. Setting s = 0, which corresponds to mul-
1)n, yields the Wigner
tiplying the count statistics by (
1
function of the signal ﬁeld. However, in the limit T
only a small fraction of the probe ﬁeld is reﬂected to the
detector, which results in the vanishing factor multiply-
ing α in Eq. (11), and thus an intense probe ﬁeld has to

→

−

be used to achieve the required shift in the phase space.
Consequently, the beam splitter should have the trans-
mission close to one, yet reﬂect enough probe ﬁeld to al-
low scanning of the interesting region of the phase space.
This decreases the ordering of the measured quasidistri-
bution slightly below zero. A more important factor that
lowers the ordering is the imperfectness of the detector.
Maximum available eﬃciency of photodetectors is lim-
ited by the current technology and on the level of single
photon signals does not exceed 80% [16]. Therefore in a
realistic setup the parameter deciding about the magni-
tude of the product ηT is the detector eﬃciency rather
then the beam splitter transmission.

−

One may attempt to compensate the lowered ordering
by setting s = 1
ηT , which would allow to measure the
Wigner function regardless of the value of ηT . However
in this case the magnitude of the factor multiplying the
count statistics in the PCGF diverges to inﬁnity, which
would be a source of severe problems in a real experi-
ment. We will discuss this point in detail later, in the
framework of a rigorous statistical analysis of the mea-
surement.

Let us close this section by presenting several exam-
ples of the photocount statistics for diﬀerent quantum
states of the signal probed by a coherent source of light.
The most straightforward case is when a coherent state
enters through the signal port of the beam splitter.
α0i

Then the statistics of the registered counts is given by
the Poisson distribution:

(J(α0))n
n!
α0|

p|α0i
n =

e−J(α0),

(12)

−

β
|

2 is the average number of reg-
where J(α0) = ηT
istered photons. When the measurement is performed at
the point where the quasidistribution of the signal ﬁeld
is centered, i.e., β = α0, the ﬁelds interfere destructively
and no photons are detected.
In general, for an arbi-
trary phase space point, the average number of registered
photons is proportional to the squared distance from α0.
Averaging Eq. (12) over an appropriate P representation
yields the photocount statistics for a thermal signal state
characterized by an average photon number ¯n:

where Ln denotes the nth Laguerre polynomial.

A more interesting case is when the signal ﬁeld is in
a nonclassical state. Then the interference between the
signal and the probe ﬁelds cannot be described within
the classical theory of radiation. We will consider two
nonclassical states: the one photon Fock state and the
Schr¨odinger cat state. The count statistics can be ob-
tained by calculating the quantum expectation value of
PCGF over the considered state and then expanding it
into the powers of (s + 1)/(s

1).

The second term corresponds to the detection of the vac-
uum signal ﬁeld. Its presence is a result of the detector
imperfectness and the leakage of the signal ﬁeld through

the unused output port of the beam splitter. This term
vanishes in the limit of ηT
1, where the Wigner func-
→
tion is measured in the setup. The ﬁrst term describes
the detection of the one photon Fock state. In Fig. 3(a)
we show the statistics generated by this term for diﬀerent
values of β. If the amplitude of the probe ﬁeld is zero,
we detect the undisturbed signal ﬁeld and the statistics
is nonzero only for n = 1. The distribution becomes ﬂat-
ter with increasing β. Its characteristic feature is that it
vanishes around n

J(0).

For the Schr¨odinger cat state deﬁned in Eq. (3) the

photocount statistics is a sum of three terms:

(cid:27)

The ﬁrst two terms describe the two coherent compo-
nents of the cat state, whereas the last one contributes
to the quantum interference structure. In Fig. 3(b) we
plot the photocount statistics for diﬀerent values of β
probing this structure, in the limit ηT
1. The four
values of β correspond to the cosine function in Eq. (4)
equal to 1, 0,
1, and 0, respectively, for t = 0. It is seen
that the form of the statistics changes very rapidly with
β. This behavior becomes clear if we rewrite the PCGF
(Eq. (10)) for s = 0 in the form

showing that in order to obtain a large positive (negative)
value of the quasidistribution the photocount statistics
has to be concentrated in even (odd) values of n.

IV. STATISTICAL ERROR

The proposed measurement scheme is based on the re-
lation between the quasidistributions and the photocount
statistics. In a real experiment the statistics of the de-
tector counts cannot be known with perfect accuracy, as
it is determined from a ﬁnite sample of N measurements.
This statistical uncertainty aﬀects the experimental value
of the quasidistribution. Theoretical analysis of the sta-
tistical error is important for two reasons. First, we need
an estimation for the number of the measurements re-
quired to determine the quasidistribution with a given
accuracy. Secondly, we have seen that one may attempt
to compensate the imperfectness of the detector and the
nonunit transmission of the beam splitter by manipulat-
ing the parameter s. However, in this case the magnitude

of the factor multiplying the count statistics diverges to
inﬁnity. This ampliﬁes the contribution of the tail of
the distribution, which is usually determined from a very
small sample of data, and may therefore result in a huge
statistical error of the ﬁnal result. Our calculations will
provide a quantitative analysis of this problem.

Due to extreme simplicity of Eq. (10), linking the count
statistics with the quasidistributions, it is possible to per-
form a rigorous analysis of the statistical error and obtain
an exact expression for the uncertainty of the ﬁnal result.
We will assume that the maximum number of the pho-
tons that can be detected in a single measurement cannot
exceed a certain cut–oﬀ parameter K. Let us denote by
kn the number of measurements when n photons have
been detected, n = 0, 1, . . . , K. The set of kn’s obeys the
multinomial distribution

which is an approximation of the series deﬁned in
Eq. (10).
In order to see how well Πexp approximates
the ideal quantity we will ﬁnd its mean value and its
variance averaged with respect to the distribution (17).
This task is quite easy, since the only expressions we need
in the calculations are the following moments:

The variance δΠ2

ond one is simply the squared average of Πexp. The ﬁrst
term is a sum over the count statistics multiplied by the

powers of a positive factor ((s + 1)(s
factor is greater than one and the sum may be arbitrarily
large. In the case when the contribution from the cut tail
of the statistics is negligible, i.e., if K
, it can be
estimated by the average number of registered photons:

Thus, the variance grows unlimited as we probe phase
space points far from the area where the quasidistribu-
tion is localized. Several examples in the next section
will demonstrate that the variance usually explodes much
more rapidly, exponentially rather than linearly. This
makes the compensation of the detector ineﬃciency a
very subtle matter.
It can be successful only for very
restricted regions of the phase space, where the count
statistics is concentrated for a small number of counts
and vanishes suﬃciently quickly for larger n’s.

Therefore, in order to ensure that the statistical error
remains bounded over the whole phase space, we have to
impose the condition s
0. Since we are interested in
achieving the highest possible ordering of the measured
quasidistribution, we should consequently set s = 0. For
this particular value the estimations for the uncertainty
of Πexp take a much simpler form. The error caused by

the “lacking” part of the probability:

Thus, the statistical uncertainty of the measured qua-
sidistribution can be simply estimated as 1/√N multi-
plied by the proportionality constant given in Eq. (11). It
is also seen that the uncertainty is smaller for the phase
space points where the magnitude of the quasidistribu-
tion is large.

Analysis of the statistical error for the recently demon-
strated measurement of the Wigner function of a trapped
ion is diﬀerent, as the analog of pn is not determined by a
counting–like method [17]. A quantity that is detected in
the experimental setup is the time–dependence of the ﬂu-
orescence light produced by driving a selected transition.
This signal is a linear combination of the populations of
the trap levels with known time–dependent coeﬃcients,
and the pn’s are extracted from these data by solving the
resulting overdetermined set of linear equations. Conse-
quently, their statistical error is not described by a simple
analytical formula. Additional source of error is the un-
certainty of the phase space displacement, which is per-
formed by applying an rf ﬁeld. An element of our analysis
that can be directly transferred to the case of a trapped
ion is the eﬀect of the cut–oﬀ of the count statistics.

V. EXAMPLES

We will now consider several examples of the recon-
struction of the quasidistributions from the data collected
in a photon counting experiment. Our discussion will be
based on Monte Carlo simulations compared with the
analytical results obtained in the previous section.

First, let us note that the huge statistical error is not
the only problem in compensating the detector ineﬃ-
ciency. If s > 0, the sum (20) does not even have to con-
verge in the limit of K
. An example of this patho-
logical behavior is provided by a thermal state, which has
been calculated in Eq. (13). For the zero probe ﬁeld we
obtain

which shows that if s > 0, then for a suﬃciently in-
tense thermal state the magnitude of the summand is
larger than one and consequently the sum diverges, when
K
. This behavior is due to the very slowly van-
ishing count distribution and it does not appear for the
other examples of the count statistics derived in Sec. III.
In Fig. 4 we plot the reconstructed quasidistributions
for the coherent state
and the one photon Fock
state. Due to the symmetry of these states, it is suﬃcient
to discuss the behavior of the reconstructed quasidistri-
bution on the real axis of the phase space. The cut–oﬀ
parameter is set high enough to make the contribution
from the cut tail of the statistics negligibly small. The
quasidistributions are determined at each phase space
point from the Monte Carlo simulations of N = 1000
events. The grey areas denote the statistical uncertainty
calculated according to Eq. (21). The two top graphs
show the reconstruction of the Wigner function in the
ideal case ηT = 1. It is seen that the statistical error is
smaller, where the magnitude of the Wigner function is
large. In the outer regions it approaches its maximum
value 1/√N . The eﬀect of the nonunit ηT is shown in
the center graphs. The measured quasidistributions be-
come wider and the negative dip in the case of the Fock
state is shallower. In the bottom graphs we depict the
result of compensating the nonunit value of ηT by set-
ting s = 1
ηT . The compensation works quite well in
the central region, where the average number of detected
photons is small, but outside of this region the statisti-
cal error explodes exponentially. Of course, the statisti-
cal error can be suppressed by increasing the number of
measurements. However, this is not a practical method,
since the statistical error decreases with the size of the
sample only as 1/√N .

plot, N = 5000 simulations were performed at each phase
space point. Comparison of the top and the center graphs
shows how even a small imperfectness in the detection de-
stroys the interference pattern. The data collected in an
nonideal setup can be processed to recover the Wigner
function, but at the cost of a signiﬁcantly larger statisti-
cal error, as it is shown in the bottom graph. Outside the
interference structure, we again observe the exponential
explosion of the dispersion due to the increasing intensity
of the detected light.

Finally, let us look at the eﬀect of cutting the statistics
at a ﬁnite value. Fig. 6 shows the Wigner functions for
the one photon coherent and Fock states reconstructed
from the count distributions cut at K = 11. We per-
formed a large number of N = 104 simulations in order
to get the pure eﬀect of the cut–oﬀ that is not spoiled
by the statistical uncertainty. The grey areas show the
cut–oﬀ error, estimated using Eq. (24). The reconstruc-
tion works well as long as the probability of detecting
more than K photons is negligible. When the average

number of incident photons starts to be comparable with
the cut–oﬀ parameter, “ghost” peaks appear. When we
go even further, the Wigner function again tends to zero,
but this is a purely artiﬁcial eﬀect due to the virtually
vanishing count distribution below K.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The newly proposed scheme for measuring the
quasiprobability distributions is based on a much more
direct link with the data collected in an experiment than
optical homodyne tomography. Furthermore, each point
of the phase space can be probed independently. The
simplicity of the underlying idea allowed us to discuss
rigorously the experimental issues, such us the statisti-
cal uncertainty and the eﬀect of the cut–oﬀ of the count
statistics.

We have seen that it is, in general, not possible to
compensate the detector ineﬃciency. This conclusion
may seem to be surprising, since it was shown that the
true photon distribution can be reconstructed from pho-
tocount statistics of an imperfect detector, provided that
its eﬃciency is larger that 50% [8]. Moreover, a simple
calculation shows that an application of this recipe for
recovering the photon distribution is equivalent to set-
ting the parameter s above zero. The solution of this
seeming contradiction is easy: the proposed recipe can
be safely used as long as we are interested in the pho-
ton statistics itself. However, the statistical errors of the
reconstructed probabilities are not independent, and an
attempt to utilize these probabilities to calculate another
physical quantity may lead to accumulation of the sta-
tistical ﬂuctuations and generate a useless result. The
1)npn is an example of
n(
simple alternating series
such a quantity.

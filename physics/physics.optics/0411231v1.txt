We investigated the Onsager relations in the context of electromagnetic
constitutive relations of linear, homogeneous materials. We determined that
application of the Onsager relations to the constitutive equations relating P
and M to both E and B is in accord with Lorentz reciprocity as well as the
Post constraint.

1 Introduction

In two seminal papers published in 1931 [1, 2], with the assumption of micro-
scopic reversibility, Onsager derived a set of reciprocity relations applicable to
coupled linear phenomenons at macroscopic length scales. Fourteen years later,
Casimir [3] improved the foundations of the Onsager relations. Initially consid-
ered applicable to purely instantaneous phenomenons — or, at least, when “time–
lag can be neglected” [1, p. 419] — the Onsager relations widened in scope as a
result of the ﬂuctuation–dissipation theorem [4] to time–harmonic phenomenons
[5]. Sections 123–125 of the famous textbook of Landau and Lifshitz on statisti-
cal physics provide a lucid introduction to the Onsager relations [6], but we also
recommend a perusal of a classic monograph by de Groot [7]. A modern appraisal
has been provided by Berdichevsky [8], whose paper motivated the work leading
to this communication.

Our focus is the correct application of the Onsager relations for linear electro-
magnetic materials. This issue can be traced back to a 1973 paper by Rado [9].
This paper contains a major conﬂict between a consequence of the assumption

1

of material response without any delay whatsoever and the Onsager relations as
expounded by Callen et al. [5]. The former is deﬁnitely a noncausal assumption
in electromagnetism [10, 11], leading to false symmetries between the electro-
magnetic constitutive parameters [12]. Furthermore, Rado considered E and H
as primitive ﬁelds, but E and B are taken to be the primitive ﬁelds in modern
electromagnetism [13, 14, 15]. To the best of our knowledge, no other original
investigation of the Onsager relations in electromagnetism exists.

Due to the currently increasing emphasis on engineered nanomaterials [16, 17]
and complex electromagnetic materials [18, 19], it is imperative that the applica-
tion of fundamental principles (such as the Onsager relations) be carefully exam-
ined with modern terminology. Accordingly, in the following sections, we ﬁrst
review the Onsager relations in general. Then we apply the Onsager relations to
the electromagnetic constitutive relations of linear, homogeneous, bianisotropic
materials. We show that a na¨ive application to constitutive equations relating D
and H to both E and B yields unphysical results, but that application to consti-
tutive equations relating P and M to both E and B is in accord with Lorentz
reciprocity [20] as well as the Post constraint [21, 22].

2 Onsager relations

Let us consider the linear macroscopic constitutive equations

Lm =

Φmn Fn , m ∈ [1, N] ,

(1)

N

X
n=1

where N > 1, Lm are the Onsager ﬂuxes and Fm are the Onsager forces. The
Onsager relations deal with the constitutive parameters Φmn.

The derivation of the Onsager relations proceeds with the postulation of N
state variables an, n ∈ [1, N]. The state variables are divided into two groups.
The ﬁrst ˜N ≤ N state variables are supposed to be even and the remaining N − ˜N
state variables are supposed to be odd with respect to a reversal of velocities of
the microscopic particles constituting the linear medium; in other words,

am(t)an(t + τ ) = am(t)an(t − τ ) ,

m ∈ [1, ˜N ] and n ∈ [1, ˜N]
or
m ∈ [ ˜N + 1, N] and n ∈ [ ˜N + 1, N]

or
m ∈ [ ˜N + 1, N] and n ∈ [1, ˜N]

where the overbar indicates averaging over time t [3].

In terms of the state variables, the Onsager ﬂuxes are deﬁned as

the Onsager forces are deﬁned as

and the coefﬁcients gmn help deﬁne the deviation ∆S of the entropy from its

3 Application to Linear Electromagnetism

3.1 Constitutive Equations for D and H

Let us now consider a linear, homogeneous, bianisotropic medium. Its constitutive
equations can be written in a cartesian coordinate system as

Dj =

Hj =

3
k=1 ǫjk ◦ Ek + ξjk ◦ Bk
P
3
k=1 ζjk ◦ Ek + νjk ◦ Bk

P






,

j ∈ [1, 3] .

(11)

We have adopted here the modern view of electromagnetism wherein E and B
are the primitive ﬁelds while D and H are the induction ﬁelds [13, 14, 15]. The
operation ◦ indicates a temporal convolution operation in the time domain, and
simple multiplication in the frequency domain [23].

Now, D and E are even, but H and B are odd, with respect to time–reversal.

With that in mind, we can rewrite (11) compactly as

Qm =

Λmn ◦ Fn , m ∈ [1, N] ,

(12)

N

X
n=1

where Fm = Em, Fm+3 = Bm, Qm = Dm and Qm+3 = Hm for m ∈ [1, 3];
furthermore, ˜N = 3 and N = 6.

With the assumption of microscopic reversibility, application of the Onsager

relations (9) and (10) yields the following symmetries:

Λmn(Bdc) = Λnm(−Bdc) ,
m ∈ [1, 3] , n ∈ [1, 3]
Λmn(Bdc) = Λnm(−Bdc) ,
m ∈ [4, 6] , n ∈ [4, 6]
Λmn(Bdc) = −Λnm(−Bdc) , m ∈ [1, 3] , n ∈ [4, 6]

.





Equations (13) imply that

ǫjk(Bdc) = ǫkj(−Bdc)
νjk(Bdc) = νkj(−Bdc)
ξjk(Bdc) = −ζkj(−Bdc)




3.2 Constitutive Equations for P and M

.

When considering a material medium, as distinct from matter–free space (i.e.,
vacuum), the presence of matter is indicated by the the polarization P = D − ǫoE
and the magnetization M = µ−1
B − H, where ǫo and µo are the permittivity and
o
the permeability of matter–free space. Linear constitutive equations for P and M
can be stated as

Pj =

Mj =

P

P

k=1 χ(3)

jk ◦ Ek + χ(2)
jk ◦ Ek + χ(4)

jk ◦ Bk

j ∈ [1, 3] ,

(15)

where

ǫjk = ǫoδjk + χ(1)

νjk = µ−1
ξjk = χ(2)

ζjk = −χ(3)
jk
and δjk is the Kronecker delta function.

o δjk − χ(4)

jk






,




As P is even but M is odd with respect to time–reversal, we can rewrite (15)

as

Rm =

Ψmn ◦ Fn , m ∈ [1, N] ,

(17)

(13)

(14)

(16)

N

X
n=1

5

(18)

(19)

(20)

where Rm = Pm and Rm+3 = Mm for m ∈ [1, 3]. As the microscopic processes
underlying the constitutive parameters in (17) are reversible, Ψmn must satisfy (9)
and (10); thus,

Ψmn(Bdc) = Ψnm(−Bdc) ,
m ∈ [1, 3] , n ∈ [1, 3]
Ψmn(Bdc) = Ψnm(−Bdc) ,
m ∈ [4, 6] , n ∈ [4, 6]
Ψmn(Bdc) = −Ψnm(−Bdc) , m ∈ [1, 3] , n ∈ [4, 6]

,





whence the symmetries

are predicted by the Onsager relations as the macroscopic consequences of micro-
scopic reversibility.

3.3 The Conﬂict

Equations (19) imply that

jk (Bdc) = χ(1)
χ(1)
χ(4)
jk (Bdc) = χ(4)
jk (Bdc) = −χ(3)
χ(2)

kj (−Bdc)
kj (−Bdc)

kj (−Bdc)






ǫjk(Bdc) = ǫkj(−Bdc)
νjk(Bdc) = νkj(−Bdc)
ξjk(Bdc) = ζkj(−Bdc)

,





by virtue of (16).

But (20)3 disagrees completely with (14)3. Let us reiterate that both (14)3 and
(20)3 come about from the application of the Onsager relations, contingent upon
the assumption of microscopic reversibility. Yet, at most, only one of the two must
be correct.

3.4 Resolution of the Conﬂict

Onsager’s own papers help resolve the conﬂict. His papers were concerned with
motion of microscopic particles, and he considered his work to hold true for heat
conduction, gaseous diffusion and related transport problems. The Onsager forces
must be causative agents, while the Onsager ﬂuxes must be directly concerned

6

with particulate motion. This understanding is reinforced by subsequent com-
mentaries [6, 7].

Therefore, in order to correctly exploit the Onsager relations in electromag-
netics, we must isolate those parts of D and H which indicate the presence of a
material, because microscopic processes cannot occur in matter–free space (i.e.,
vacuum). The matter–indicating parts of D and H are P and M. Hence, (20)
must be accepted and (14) must be discarded.

With Bdc = 0, the symmetries (20) coincide — unlike (14) — with those
mandated by Lorentz reciprocity [20, Eqs. 23]. Also unlike (14), the symmetries
(20) are compatible with the Post constraint [21, 22]

3

j=1

ξjj =

(21)

which must be satisﬁed by all (i.e., Lorentz–reciprocal as well as Lorentz–nonreciprocal)
linear materials. These two well–known facts also support our decision to discard
(14) in favor of (20).

4 Concluding Remarks

In this communication, we ﬁrst reviewed the Onsager relations which delineate the
macroscopic consequences of microscopic reversibility in linear materials. Then
we applied the relations to the electromagnetic constitutive relations of homoge-
neous bianisotropic materials. We determined that a na¨ive application to consti-
tutive equations relating D and H to both E and B yields unphysical results, but
that application to constitutive equations relating P and M to both E and B is in
accord with Lorentz reciprocity as well as the Post constraint.

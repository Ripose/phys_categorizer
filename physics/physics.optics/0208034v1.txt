Abstract

A monochromatic linear source of light is rotated with certain angular frequency and when

such light is analysed after reﬂection then a change of frequency or wavelength may be observed

depending on the location of the observer. This change of frequency or wavelength is diﬀerent from

the classical Doppler eﬀect [1] or relativistic Doppler eﬀect [2]. The reason behind this shift in

wavelength is that a certain time interval observed by an observer in the rotating frame is diﬀerent

from that of a stationary observer.

A linear source of light (wavelength λ and frequency ν ) is rotating at O (Figure) and it
sweeps an angle ∆θ in time ∆t, the angular frequency being ω = ∆θ/∆t, BQC a reﬂector

which reﬂects the light from O to P. A ray of light (ray 1 ) traveling in the direction OB

reﬂected from the point B, reaches the observer at P. The distance the light travels OBP

is r1. After a time ∆t another ray OCP (ray 2) reaches the observer at P, the distance it

travels i.e. OCP is r2. Let n number of waves are emitted when the light sweeps through

the angle ∆θ in time ∆t. The observer at P receives the same n-waves, the time diﬀerence

between the ﬁrst ray and the last ray (i.e. between ray 1 and ray 2) is

∆T = ∆t + r2/c − r1/c

(c is the velocity of light)

Because, ray 1 takes a time r1/c and ray 2 takes a time ∆t + r2/c

(r2 − r1)

+ ve sign when r2 > r1 and -ve sign when r2 < r1

∆T = ∆t ±

∆T = ∆t ± δr/c where ∆r = |r2 − r1|

It is to be noted that n waves are emitted by O in time δt and the same n waves are
collected or received by P in time ∆T and ∆t 6= δT because r2 6= r1. In a special case
r2 = r1 and δT = δt. Since n waves are emitted in time δt therefore time period of one
wave emitted by O is ∆t . The frequency of the wave emitted by O, ν = n/∆t.

Similarly the same n waves are received at P in time ∆T . So time period of one wave

received by P will be ∆T /n. The frequency of the received wave at P, ν′ = n/∆T Since

∆t 6= ∆T

Changes in wavelength,

∆λ = λ′ − λ = c/n(∆T − ∆t)

λ = c/ν and λ′ = c/ν′

ν 6= ν′

λ = c∆t/n

λ′ = c∆T /n

∆λ = c/n(±δr/c)

∆λ = ±δr/n

∆λ/λ = ±∆r/c∆t

∆λ/λ′ = ±∆r/c∆T

+ ve sign means an increase in wavelength

- ve sign means a decrease in wavelength.

The change in wavelength depends on ∆r i.e. the diﬀerence between r1 and r2. So, the

change in wavelength depends on the location of the point P. Also there is no shift in
wavelength when r2 = r1.

The above expression for shift in wavelength is diﬀerent from the classical expression for

Doppler eﬀect as well as from the relativistic Doppler eﬀect (Transverse Doppler eﬀect).

It is evident in the present circumstance that the time interval recorded by a rotating

frame at O is ∆t whereas the same time interval is recorded by a stationary frame is ∆T ,

they are related by the equation : ∆T = ∆t ± ∆r/c. again ∆T depends on ∆r i.e. location

of the point P.

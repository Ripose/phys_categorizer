We investigate the behaviour of a three-phase composite, structured as a hexagonal array of coated
cylinders, when the sum of the dielectric constants of the core and shell equals zero. In such cases,
the absorption of the composite is the same as the absorption of a periodic array of solid cylinders of
core material and radius equal to the outer radius of the original coated cylinder. When the sum of
the dielectric constants of the shell and matrix equals zero, the composite has the same absorption
as a periodic array of solid cylinders of core material, and radius exceeding the shell radius.

I. INTRODUCTION

plied in the plane perpendicular to the cylinder axes (see
Fig. 1). However, the method we use may be applied
equally well to any periodic array of coated cylinders.

Previous studies of the eﬀective dielectric constant of
a periodic array of coated cylinders, in the quasistatic
limit, have revealed some unexpected and interesting re-
sults [1–3]. Speciﬁcally, we have used the method of Lord
Rayleigh [4] to investigate the analytic properties of the
eﬀective dielectric constant of the array, as a function of
the core dielectric constant (εc) and the shell dielectric
constant (εs), while keeping the matrix dielectric con-
stant (εm) ﬁxed.

We have shown that when εc + εs = 0, the composite
has exactly the same eﬀective dielectric constant as a pe-
riodic array of solid cylinders with dielectric constant εc
and radius equal to the outer radius of the original coated
cylinder. We have also shown that when εs + εm = 0, the
composite has exactly the same eﬀective dielectric con-
stant as a periodic array of solid cylinders with dielectric
constant εc, and radius exceeding the shell radius.
In
both cases, the core is magniﬁed and it may be possible
for a system with a vanishingly small concentration to ex-
hibit properties like those of a concentrated system. This
is what we have called a partially resonant system, since
the system has a ﬁnite, rather than an inﬁnite, response
to the applied ﬁeld.

The same eﬀect appears in the case of a random mix-
ture of coated cylinders with nonlinear cores and linear
shells [5]. Under conditions of partial resonance, the sys-
tem behaves as a mixture of nonlinear solid cylinders of
radii equal to, or larger than, those of the original coated
cylinders.

Here, we show how these results carry over to prob-
lems of electromagnetic scattering by periodic arrays of
coated cylinders, and elucidate the relation between par-
tial resonances and anomalous absorptance of metallic
wires [6]. From the many possible ways of packing cylin-
ders in regular arrays in two dimensions we concentrate
on the hexagonal lattice that is isotropic for ﬁelds ap-

Recent work by Pendry et al. [7] has heightened inter-
est in the extraordinary and sometimes paradoxical be-

1

haviour which can arise in composite systems, in which
one component has a dielectric constant (or a magnetic
permeability) which takes approximately a real and neg-
ative value. In such a composite we may observe strong
focusing of light at a plane interface, or ultra-refraction
[8], or a dilute composite masquerading as a concentrated
one [1–3]. Again, the use of metal-coated spheres in pho-
tonic crystals has resulted in robust band gaps, indepen-
dent of sphere-packing geometries [9].

II. THE FIELD IDENTITY

A. Field Expansions

We consider the electromagnetic modes of a three–
phase composite consisting of an array of coated cylin-
ders of inﬁnite length, each aligned parallel to the z
axis, inserted into a matrix of dielectric constant εm and
magnetic permeability µm. For each cylinder, the core
and shell are characterized by the radii rc and rs, di-
electric constants εc and εs, and magnetic permeabilities
µc and µs, respectively. We also assume that the elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁelds depend on time through a factor
exp (
iωt). The core and shell of all cylinders, as well
as the matrix are homogeneous so that, the ﬁelds satisfy
the Maxwell equations:

the axes of the cylinders in the array, we have β = 0,
and the problem can be reduced to solving two indepen-
dent problems [11]: (i) for TM or s polarization (when

In the case of TM polarization, for the cylinder cen-

The eigenfrequencies (ω) of the Helmholtz equation (5)
are obtained from the zeros of the determinant of (25).
In the coordinate system ω versus kB, the photonic band
diagrams are given by the trajectories of the eigenfre-
quencies ω when kB follows the boundary of one of the
irreducible regions in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone (see Fig. 2).
In the case of metallic media, kB becomes complex. It
is then simpler to use a summation method [14] diﬀerent
from (26), and a technique, based on Bloch’s theorem,
developed originally by McRae [15] in low energy electron
diﬀraction, and applied recently to photonic crystals by
Gralak et al. [8]. We consider the array as an inﬁnite
stack of gratings and calculate the scattering matrices
for a single grating in the array [16]. Then, the complex
crystal momentum kB is found by solving an eigenvalue
problem [17].

III. THE LONG WAVELENGTH LIMIT

A. Partial Resonances

The solution of the problem of electromagnetic scat-
tering by a solid cylinder, at normal incidence and in the
long wavelength limit [18], revealed the occurrence of a
resonance in scattering when the relative dielectric con-
stant of the cylinder was -1. Later, the existence of this
resonance was proved experimentally in studies of radio
reﬂection by meteor trails [19], and of plasma columns
[20,21]. Also, Wait [22,23] has shown that in the long
wavelength limit the scattering resonances given by the
formula

(µ1 + µ2) (ε1 + ε2) = 0,

(31)

where the label 1 refers to the cylinder and 2 refers to
the homogeneous medium outside the cylinder, are inde-
pendent of the polarization and angle of incidence. Note
that, in electrostatics the condition (ε1 + ε2) = 0 de-
ﬁnes the accumulation point for the poles and zeros of
the eﬀective dielectric constant of a two–phase compos-
ite [24,25], with (µ1 + µ2) = 0 corresponding to magne-
tostatics.

We applied the method developed by Wait [22] to solve
the problem of scattering of a plane wave by a coated
cylinder at oblique incidence.
In this case, in the long
wavelength limit we obtained the resonance condition

(µc + µs) (µs + µm) (εc + εs) (εs + εm) = 0,

(32)

which describes precisely the electrostatic partial reso-
nances of a three–phase composite [1–3], plus their mag-
netostatic counterpart. The resonance condition (32)
also suggests a generalization to a n–phase composite,
of the form

(µi + µi+1) (εi + εi+1) = 0,

(33)

n−1

i=0
Y

for the case of a multi-coated cylinder. Here, µn and εn
denote the magnetic permeability and dielectric constant
of the innermost phase (core), while µ0 and ε0 represent
the magnetic permeability and dielectric constant of the
medium outside the composite.

B. TE Polarization

mε0, εs = n2

We concentrate now on non-magnetic materials for
which µm = µs = µc = µ0, so that εm = n2
sε0
and εc = n2
cε0, where ε0 is the dielectric constant of free
space, and ni (i = m, s, c) represent the refractive in-
dexes of the matrix, shell and core, respectively. In the

long wavelength limit (km

polarization. For l

In electrostatics, the corresponding relationship be-

.

Note that, due to the symmetry properties of the elec-
trostatic potential, l cannot take even values in the case
of a square array, or values which are multiples of 3 in
the case of a hexagonal array [28]. By comparing (37)
with (38) we may deduce the relation between static and
dynamic multipole coeﬃcients

that of an array of solid cylinders of radius r2
s /rc > rs
(the geometrical image of the core boundary with respect
to the shell outer boundary), and dielectric constant εc.
Now, the ﬁeld external to the coated cylinder and beyond
the radius r2
s /rc is the same as that external to the solid
cylinder [1].

Since it is the relationship between the coeﬃcients Al
and Bl which controls the response of a coated cylinder
to an external ﬁeld, equations (38) and (37) show that
this response is determined by γl in electrostatics as well
as in the long wavelengths limit of electrodynamics. The
limiting process is smooth and, therefore, we expect a
resonant behaviour of the array of coated cylinders, for
nonzero frequencies, when one of the conditions (41) or
(42) is satisﬁed.

C. TM Polarization

The behaviour of the array of coated cylinders is com-
pletely diﬀerent in the case of TM polarization. Now,

εc + εs or εs + εm in (53) or (54) to indicate a core–shell
or shell–matrix partial resonance. Again, the limiting
process is smooth and, consequently, we do not expect a
resonant behaviour of the array of coated cylinders, for
any frequency, in the case of TM polarization.

A. Partial Resonances

In the case of an absorbing (metallic–type) core and
a dielectric shell, the constant, the positive value of the
shell dielectric constant (εs = n2
d) makes impossible a
relation of the type n2
m = 0 corresponding to a
shell–matrix partial resonance. Hence, we expect only
core–shell partial resonances, which are deﬁned by the
equation

In this section we discuss the behaviour of a three–
phase composite consisting of aluminium oxide (Al2O3),
whose refractive index depends on the frequency, and two
pure dielectric phases: one with a refractive index nd =
1.37, and vacuum (n0 = 1).

hexagonal array. The vertical magenta lines mark the two

B. Absorbing Core and Dielectric Shell

Here, we consider that the coated cylinders have an
aluminium oxide core (nc = nAl2O3
), a dielectric coating
(ns = nd), and are embedded in vacuum (nm = 1). The
coating is a lossless, dielectric material of constant (i.e.,
independent of frequency) refractive index ns=1.37. This
is essentially the same as the refractive index of MgF2 for
1µm . λ . 2.5µm [31,32].

1. TE Polarization

In Fig. 5 we show a comparison between two types
of stacks of gratings: a stack of 30 gratings of solid

cylinders having a refractive index nc = nAl2O3
and ra-
dius rc = 0.03µm (dashed curves), and for a stack of
30 gratings of coated cylinders deﬁned at the beginning
of Sec. IV B (solid curves).
In both cases, the period
of the gratings is d = 1µm. Actually, we compare the
stack of coated cylinders with a stack in which the cylin-
der coatings have been removed (but keeping al the other
parameters unchanged), to show the inﬂuence of the shell
on the optical properties of the stack (reﬂectance, trans-
mittance and absorptance), for normal incidence and TE
polarization.

≈

+ n2

Al2O3

We can see in Fig. 5 an enhancement in absorptance
for the stack of coated cylinders at λ1, while the stack
of solid cylinders exhibits an anomalous absorptance at
λc
12.151µm < λ1, which corresponds to the classical
resonance of a two–phase composite n2
m = 0
[24,25] (in fact, the wavelength for this classical reso-
nance, λc =
λ1, is given by (62)) Thus, in the case of
TE polarization there is a partial resonance of the type
core–shell at λ1 = 12.861µm. At this wavelength, the
anomalous increase of the absorptance of coated cylin-
ders shows a lossy (or metallic) type behaviour, which is
a characteristic of aluminium oxide and is never exhibited
by the dielectric shell (lossless media). Note that the core
radius is ten times smaller than the shell radius. We can
also see in Fig. 6 that, at λ1 the absorptance of the stack
of coated cylinders (blue solid curve) is approximatively
equal with the absorptance of a stack of solid cylinders,
made from Al2O3, and having the radius rs = 0.31µm
(blue dashed curve).

e

stack of coated cylinders are almost constant, except a
small region around λ1. If we label by cc the reﬂectance
(Rcc), transmittance (Tcc) and absorptance (Acc) for the
stack of coated cylinders, and by sc the corresponding
quantities (Rsc, Tsc, Asc) for the stack of solid cylinders,
then, in the neighbourhood of the core–shell partial res-
onance, we have:

Equation (67) shows that the equivalence between the
two types of stacks is actually a sort of dualityin the sense
that they have similar absorptance, but the resonant sys-
tem resembles a material which absorbs and transmits
the incident radiation, while the stack of Al2O3cylinders
absorbs and reﬂects incident radiation.

In conclusion, at λ1, for normal incidence and TE po-
larization, the stack of coated cylinders with a very small
metallic–type core, has really the same absorptance as
a stack of solid metallic cylinders of an enlarged radius
It looks like the core and the shell are

tance as the core material, an eﬀect identical with the
core–shell partial resonance from electrostatics [1–3].

2. TM Polarization

There is no partial resonance for a stack of coated
cylinders, for TM polarization. Fig. 7 shows no change
of optical characteristics around λ1. The second solu-
17.333µm, and at this wavelength
tion of (57) is λ2 ≈
the stack of 30 gratings of coated cylinders exhibits an
anomalous absorptance (see Fig. 7), which corresponds
to the large imaginary part of (61). The stack of solid
and ra-
cylinders having a refractive index nc = nAl2O3

dius rc = 0.03µm, exhibits an anomalous absorptance
λ2, corresponding to (66).
(see Fig. 7) at

e

e

In both cases, the anomalous high absorptance is not
a resonance eﬀect, and it is produced by an anomalous
behaviour of the relative dielectric constant of Al2O3. At
λ2 the real part of the relative dielectric constant
λ2 ≈
of Al2O3 is relatively small, while the imaginary part
reaches a maximum value of
30 (see Fig. 3). Therefore
the absorptance of the core of coated cylinders, or of the
thin cylinders of core material only becomes large (see
Fig. 7). At the same time, for long wavelengths and
TM polarization, the eﬀective dielectric constant of an
array of cylinders is given by the linear mixing formula
(54). Thus, for an array of coated cylinders the relative
eﬀective dielectric constant is

≈

ε∗ = fc

+ fs

+ fm ,

εm

εs
εm

while for the array of solid cylinders of core material and
radius rc we have

(68)

(69)

ε∗ = fc

+ fm .

εc
εm

Hence, for a pure dielectric shell (εs =constant), in both
cases, the behaviour of ε∗ is determined by εc and this
explains the common maximum in absorptance shown in
Fig. 7, at the same position as the maximum in the imag-
inary part of the relative dielectric constant of Al2O3 (see
Fig. 3). Also, around the wavelength associated with this
maximum, the real part of the relative dielectric constant
of Al2O3 exhibits a sudden jump from negative to pos-
itive values, which makes almost equal the roots of the
equations (57) and (62). Actually, the anomalous ab-
sorptance exhibited by stacks of thin, solid cylinders has
been described in Ref. [6].

C. Dielectric Core and Absorbing Shell

Here, we consider the complementary structure with
coated cylinders, having a dielectric core (nc = nd) and
an aluminium oxide coating (ns = nAl2O3
), embedded in
vacuum (nm = 1). Now, the core is a lossless, dielectric
material of constant εc.
In this case, we expect both
types of partial resonances to occur, and in both cases the
coated cylinder has to exhibit the characteristics of a solid
cylinder made from the core material. Absorptance is a
characteristic feature of the metallic phase. Therefore,
we expect a decrease of the total absorptance for the
stack of gratings, around λ1 and

λ1.

1. TE Polarization

e

For TE polarization the reﬂectance, transmittance and
absorptance of the stack of coated cylinders with dielec-
tric core and metallic shell, are almost the same as in the

λ1 ≈
e

case of a stack of solid cylinders of radius rs, made from
aluminium oxide (see Fig. 8). Thus, in the neighbour-
12.151µm the
hood of the shell–matrix resonance at
two stacks have the same optical characteristics. In fact,
Eq.(44) shows that the coated cylinders must have opti-
cal characteristics similar to those of solid cylinders made
from core material and of an extended radius a = r2
s /rc.
In our case this means equivalent dielectric cylinders of
radius a = 3.2µm >> d/2 = 0.5µm, i.e. we have a
stack of intersecting cylinders forming a homogeneous,
dielectric slab, and we cannot apply the formulation from
In the neighbourhood of the core–shell reso-

imum in absorptance appears due to the anomalous be-

haviour of εAl2O3

curves), and for a stack of coated cylinders with rc = 0.03
and rs = 0.31 (solid curves). In both cases the stack consists
of 30 gratings of cylinders in a hexagonal array. The vertical
magenta lines mark the solutions λ1 and λ2 of (57), and

e
To avoid such situations when the resonant system
cannot be modelled by the formulation from Sec. II, we
consider a stack of coated cylinders with a larger core
rc = 0.21. In this case, a shell–matrix partial resonance
will lead us to an equivalent dielectric cylinder, having a
radius a = 0.46µm < d/2. Now, in the neighbourhood
λ1, the stack of coated
of the shell–matrix resonance at
cylinders exhibits a drop in absorptance, an increased
transmittance and a very small reﬂectance, while a stack
of aluminium oxide cylinders having the radius rs has a
zero transmittance and equal reﬂectance and absorptance
(see Fig. 9). The equivalent stack, formed by dielectric
cylinders of radius a, has a zero absorptance by deﬁnition.
For long wavelengths (λ > d) it has a low reﬂectance and

a high transmittance, therefore, the only indication of
the existence of a shell–matrix partial resonance is the
nonzero transmittance exhibited by the coated cylinders.

2. TM Polarization

As in the case of TE polarization, when the core radius
of the coated cylinders is small (so that a = r2
s /rc > d/2),
for TE polarization the reﬂectance, transmittance and
absorptance of the stack of coated cylinders with dielec-
tric core and metallic–type shell, are almost the same
as in the case of a stack of solid cylinders of radius rs,
made from aluminium oxide (see Fig. 10). In fact, there
is no resonant behaviour in the whole range 10µm < λ <
20µm.

In the case of a larger core of coated cylinders, the ef-
fect of shell–matrix partial resonance is small for TM po-
larization. Around λ =
λ1 the absorptance of the coated
cylinders is almost equal with their transmittance, and
the reﬂectance is close to zero. The curves displayed in
Fig. 11 show no sudden change around
λ1 (shell–matrix
partial resonance) and λ1 (core–shell partial resonance),
but it is interesting to remark the duality (70) at λ1.

coated cylinders, at long wavelengths. For such struc-
tures there are two types of partial resonances: shell–
matrix and core–shell. We have shown that the shell–
matrix resonance has a very small eﬀect. In contrast, the
core–shell resonance appears for TE polarization in both
cases of coated cylinders metal–dielectric–vacuum and
dielectric–metal– vacuum. Note that, for such resonances
the stack of coated cylinders has a nonzero absorptance,
so we cannot compare it with a stack of dielectric cylin-
ders (in the case of dielectric–metal–vacuum composite).
However, the comparison with a stack of solid, metal-
lic cylinders of radius rs shows equal absorptance and a
reﬂectance–transmittance duality, for the core–shell res-
onance.

An interesting behaviour is exhibited by the composite
λ1) and core–shell (λ1)
in the vicinity of shell–matrix (
resonances (see Figs. 6, 7, 9 and 11). In these regions,
the composite has a very low reﬂectance (Rcc
0), while
the transmittance and absorptance take similar values.

Generally, a band gap is deﬁned by R=1, and T=0,
so that sudden changes in optical characteristics of an
array of coated cylinders will change the photonic band
diagram. In our calculations the partial resonances oc-
cur at long wavelengths (i.e., in the region of the acoustic
band) and we expect the photonic band diagram of the
composite to show horizontal lines intersecting the acous-
tic band. These ultrafast changes in the behaviour of a
composite, due to the dependence of the refractive in-
dexes on the wavelength, can provide the basis of future
optical switches in photonic integrated circuits.

Abstract. A widespread,
intuitive and computationally inexpensive method to
analyze light guidance through waveguide bends is by introducing an equivalent
straight waveguide with refractive index proﬁle modiﬁed to account for actual
waveguide bend. Here we revise the commonly used equivalent-index formula,
ending up with its simple extension that enables rigorous treatment of one- and
two-dimensionally conﬁned, uniformly bent waveguides,
including tightly coiled
microstructure ﬁbers, curved ridge waveguides and ring microresonators. We also
show that such technique is applicable only to waveguides composed of isotropic or
uniaxially anisotropic materials, with anisotropy axis directed perpendicular to the
curvature plane.

To understand and to predict light wave behavior at waveguide bends was of
major importance and interest to integrated- and ﬁbre-optics community from around
1970s and onwards. Today this interest is stimulated largely by two developments:
(i) increasing the packaging density of integrated-optic circuits, backed by minimizing
integrated waveguide bend radii while keeping bend losses at a tolerable level; and (ii)
the advent of photonic crystal ﬁbers possessing quite complicated, high index-contrast
dielectric proﬁles as compared to step- or graded-index ﬁbers for which early theoretical
methods to treat bend losses were developed.

Numerical methods to simulate light propagation through waveguide bends, such as
beam propagation method [1], the method of lines [2, 3], as well as more general-purpose
ﬁnite-element and ﬁnite-diﬀerence techniques, can be very demanding computationally:
in one recent example [4], a 64-processors cluster was used in full-vector ﬁnite-element
modelling. No wonder one leans to analytic techniques to reduce computation burden
whenever possible; one such technique, perhaps the simplest and most widely used
in modelling of microstructure ﬁbre bends today [5, 6, 7, 8],
is equivalent-proﬁle
method [9, 10]. It reduces dimensionality of the problem by replacing actual waveguide
bend by a straight piece with refractive index proﬁle

to a (somewhat arbitrary) waveguide central plane, y the distance from that plane.
Designed for elegant and inexpensive treatment of bends, though, formula (1) grounds
on approximations whose validity may often be questioned, as those of weak-guidance
regime and small curvature (y/R
1), and originally was introduced for quite a speciﬁc
case of non-magnetic, step-index, low index-contrast ﬁbre. In this Letter we overcome all
these limitations by an alternative, ﬁrst-principle derivation of expressions for modiﬁed
dielectric permittivity ǫ and magnetic permeability µ analogous to (1), but applicable
to waveguides of arbitrary cross-section under the only assumption that bend radius is
constant (while not necessarily large).

corresponding to H and D, jλ and ρ are electric current and charge densities, λ, ν =

quantities, Eqs. (2), (3) are known to be form-invariant [11, 12], i.e., they do not change
their form under arbitrary revertible coordinate transformations. It might be practical
to convert Eqs. (2), (3) with use of dual equivalents ˜Bκ = 1

material ﬁelds (7) exclusively; since the form of (4), (5) is precisely as if they were written
in Cartesian components, a multitude of analytic and numeric methods developed for

be independent of one (or more) of the coordinates in a chosen coordinate system,

Maxwell equations (4), (5) and diﬀerentiating the exp(iβφ) multipliers with respect to
φ, normalizing the propagation constant β by R in the usual manner and introducing
shifted coordinate y = r

R, one obtains

−
ǫxx = ǫyy = ǫC(1 + y/R),

ǫzz = ǫC(1 + y/R)−1

(we do not distinguish between co- and contravariant indices once particular coordinate
system is chosen), and similarly for permeability components:

µxx = µyy = µC(1 + y/R), µzz = µC(1 + y/R)−1.

Note that expressions for ǫxx and ǫyy, multiplied by their magnetic counterparts, lead
xx = ǫxxµxx and n2
to refractive tensor components n2
yy = ǫyyµyy precisely in line with
standard formula (1) in the case of non-magnetic media. The ǫzz and µzz components
manifestly diﬀer from the rest, however (see ﬁgure 1); this diﬀerence becomes especially
pronounced when departing from weakly guiding approximation, as soon as non-
negligible z-components of electric and magnetic ﬁelds would ‘probe’ the ǫzz(x, y) and
µzz(x, y) proﬁles then.

A benchmark example to illustrate the validity of formulae (12), (13) is a problem
of light propagation through a homogeneous slab waveguide bend that permits precise
analytic treatment—see e.g. [14] for an overview. In our approach, covariant Maxwell
µκλ ˙˜H λ and ˜Eκλν∂λ ˜Hν = ǫκλ ˙Eλ, reduce to four independent
curl equations, ˜Eκλν∂λEν =

where k is the free-space wavenumber, neﬀ = β/(kR) the dimensionless mode index; and

be regarded as an eigenproblem in neﬀ), we diﬀerentiate (14) with respect to r, use (15)
for ∂r ˜Hφ and ik ˜Hφ = r

a Bessel equation used customarily in exact analysis of bent slab waveguides [14, 15],
while an attempt to get similar equation with use of approximate equivalent-index
formula (1) fails. The results of full-vector two-dimensional ﬁnite-diﬀerence frequency-
domain (FDFD) modelling of conﬁned modes in a high-contrast step-index optical ﬁbre
(ﬁgure 2) demonstrate systematic discrepancy between approximate model (1) and
formulae (12), (13); a discrepancy which can not be tolerated in realistic simulations of
high index contrast ridge waveguides and holey ﬁbers, ring microresonators, or sharp
ﬁbre bends such as those due to non-perfect alignment of ﬁbre splices.

A closer inspection of (10) brings to conclusion that the only type of initial
anisotropy in ǫC and µC which still permits ruling out the φ dependence in ǫλν and µλν

and likewise for modiﬁed µ. Unfortunately, however, the case of anisotropy given by (17)
is not one encountered when modelling, e.g., photonic bandgap ﬁbre ﬁlled with liquid
crystal; for that and other examples of curved waveguides possessing anisotropy of some
general kind, rigorous equivalent-proﬁle formulation is not applicable and should be
substantiated by more brute-force numeric or less stringent analytic techniques.

In summary, equivalent-proﬁle expressions (12), (13) to treat waveguide bends
have been presented. Unlike conventional formula (1), they hold for arbitrarily tight
bends, arbitrary high-contrast material proﬁles, and permit the inclusion of magnetic
parts. This oﬀers three-dimensional modelling accuracy with those existing full-vectorial
two-dimensional ﬁnite-diﬀerence or ﬁnite-element solvers which permit 3
3 diagonal
matrices for ǫ and µ be put in. Eliminating the restraints on bend radius and refractive
index contrast enables one to simulate also the whispering-gallery modes in spherical,
toroidal and other types of optical microcavities. The principal
limitation of the
equivalent-proﬁle technique is that many cases of non-trivial anisotropy can not be
treated rigorously in the manner above.

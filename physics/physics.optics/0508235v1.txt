ABSTRACT
The geometric representation at a ﬁxed frequency of the wavevector (or dispersion) surface ω(~k) for

lossless, homogeneous dielectric–magnetic uniaxial materials is explored, when the elements of the

relative permittivity and permeability tensors of the material can have any sign. Electromagnetic

plane waves propagating inside the material can exhibit dispersion surfaces in the form of ellipsoids

of revolution, hyperboloids of one sheet, or hyperboloids of two sheets. Furthermore, depending

on the relative orientation of the optic axis, the intersections of these surfaces with ﬁxed planes of

propagation can be circles, ellipses, hyperbolas, or straight lines. The obtained understanding is

used to study the reﬂection and refraction of electromagnetic plane waves due to a planar interface

with an isotropic medium.

Introduction

Recent developments in mesoscopic (i.e., structured but eﬀectively homogeneous) materials have

signiﬁcantly broadened the range of available electromagnetic constitutive properties, thereby al-

lowing the realization of solutions to Maxwell’s equations which could have been previously regarded

as mere academic exercises. Materials having eﬀectively negative real permittivity and permeability

have been constructed [1, 2, 3] from arrays of conducting wires [4] and arrays of split ring resonators

[5]. Such composite materials — often called metamaterials — exhibit a negative index of refraction

in certain frequency regimes [6]. Under these conditions, the phase velocity vector is in the opposite

direction of the energy ﬂux, for which reason they have been called negative–phase–velocity (NPV)

materials [7, 8].

NPV metamaterials synthesized thus far are actually anisotropic in nature, and any hypothesis

about their isotropic behavior holds only under some restrictions on propagation direction and

polarization state. In anisotropic NPV materials, the directions of power ﬂow and phase velocity

are not necessarily antiparallel but — more generally — have a negative projection of one on

the other [9]. Since the use of anisotropic NPV materials oﬀers ﬂexibility in design and ease of

fabrication, attention has begun to be drawn to such materials [10, 11, 12, 13].

Natural crystals are characterized by permittivity and permeability tensors with the real part of

all their elements positive, a fact that leads to dispersion equations in the form of closed surfaces. On

the other hand, a relevant characteristic of NPV metamaterials is that the real parts of the elements

of their permittivity and permeability tensors can have diﬀerent signs in diﬀerent frequency ranges.

As an example, Parazzoli et al. [2] demonstrated negative refraction using s–polarized microwaves

and samples for which the permittivity and permeability tensors have certain eigenvalues that

are negative real. Under such circumstances, dispersion equations are topologically similar to

open surfaces [14]. Consequently, the intersection of a dispersion surface and a ﬁxed plane of

propagation may be a curve of an unusual shape, compared with its analogs for natural crystals.

For example, extraordinary plane waves in a simple dielectric (nonmagnetic) uniaxial medium can

exhibit dispersion curves which are hyperbolic, instead of the usual elliptic curves characteristic of

natural uniaxial crystals [14, 15]. In recent studies on the characteristics of anisotropic materials

with hyperbolic dispersion curves, new phenomenons have been identiﬁed, such as omnidirectional

reﬂection — either from a single boundary [10] or from multilayers [16] — and the possibility of an

inﬁnite number of refraction channels due to a periodically corrugated surface [17, 18].

In this paper, we are interested in studying the conditions under which the combination of

permittivity and permeability tensors with the real parts of their elements of arbitrary sign, leads

to closed or open dispersion surfaces for a homogeneous dielectric–magnetic uniaxial material. To

2

characterize this kind of material, four constitutive scalars are needed:

ǫk and µk, which are the respective elements of the relative permittivity and relative perme-

ability tensors along the optic axis; and

ǫ⊥ and µ⊥, which are the elements of the two tensors in the plane perpendicular to the optic

•

•

axis.

These scalars have positive real parts for natural crystals, but their real parts can have any sign

for artiﬁcial (but still eﬀectively homogeneous) materials. The dispersion equation for plane waves

in such a material can be factorized into two terms, leading to the conclusion that the material

supports the propagation of two diﬀerent types of linearly polarized waves, called magnetic and

electric modes [19, 20].

The relative permittivity and permeability tensors, ˜ǫ and ˜µ, are real symmetric when dissipation

can be ignored. Then, each tensor can be classiﬁed as [21]:

(i) positive deﬁnite, if all eigenvalues are positive;

(ii) negative deﬁnite, if all eigenvalues are negative; and

(iii) indeﬁnite, if it has both negative and positive eigenvalues.

Thus, the relative permittivity tensor is positive deﬁnite if ǫ⊥ > 0 and ǫk > 0; it is negative deﬁnite

if ǫ⊥ < 0 and ǫk < 0; and it is indeﬁnite if ǫ⊥ǫk < 0. In the present context, we exclude constitutive

tensors with null eigenvalues. A similar classiﬁcation applies to the relative permeability tensor. If

both ˜ǫ and ˜µ are positive deﬁnite, the material is of the positive–phase–velocity (PPV) kind.

The plan of this paper is as follows. Considering the diﬀerent possible combinations of ˜ǫ and ˜µ,

we show in Section 2 that magnetic and electric propagating modes can exhibit dispersion surfaces

which are

(a) ellipsoids of revolution,

(b) hyperboloids of one sheet, or

(c) hyperboloids of two sheets.

3

As a byproduct of our analysis, we also obtain diﬀerent possible combinations of ˜ǫ and ˜µ that

preclude the propagation of a mode — either electric, magnetic or both — inside the material. In

Section 3 we study the intersection between the dispersion surfaces and a ﬁxed plane of propagation

that is arbitrarily oriented with respect to the optic axis. We show that, depending on the relative

orientation of the optic axis, diﬀerent dispersion curves, in the form of circles, ellipses, hyperbolas

or even straight lines, can be obtained. Previous studies on dielectric–magnetic materials with

indeﬁnite constitutive tensors only considered planes of propagation coinciding with coordinate

planes, thus failing to identify the singular case of linear dispersion equations. These results are used

in Section 4 to discuss the reﬂection and refraction of electromagnetic plane waves due to a planar

interface between a dielectric–magnetic uniaxial material and an isotropic medium. Concluding

remarks are provided in Section 5. An exp(

iωt) time–dependence is implicit, with ω as angular

frequency, t as time, and i = √

2 Dispersion surfaces

The relative permeability and permittivity tensors of the anisotropic medium share the same optic

axis denoted by the unit vector ˆc, and their four eigenvalues are denoted by ǫ⊥,k and µ⊥,k.

which displays symmetry of revolution about the kk axis in three–dimensional ~k–space. The pa-
rameters A and B depend on the kind of mode (electric or magnetic) and their values determine

the propagating or evanescent character of each mode and the geometric nature of the dispersion

surface for propagating modes.

One of the following conditions applies for a speciﬁc mode:

(i) A > 0 and B > 0: the dispersion surface is an ellipsoid of revolution;

(ii) A > 0 and B < 0: the dispersion surface is an hyperboloid of one sheet (Figure 1a);

(iii) A < 0 and B > 0: the dispersion surface is an hyperboloid of two sheets (Figure 1b);

(iv) A < 0 and B < 0: the mode is evanescent.

Depending on the particular combination of ˜ǫ and ˜µ, we obtain from these conditions diﬀerent

dispersion surfaces. For example, the dispersion equations for electric and magnetic modes in

natural crystals are both represented by eq. 7 with A > 0 and B > 0, a fact that leads to

the known result that electric and magnetic modes have dispersion surfaces in the form of either

prolate or oblate ellipsoids of revolution. The same result is obtained for metamaterials with both

constitutive tensors negative deﬁnite. When the analysis is repeated for all possible combinations

between the four constitutive scalars ǫ⊥, ǫk, µ⊥ and µk, the results summarized in Table 1 are

obtained.

Intersection with a ﬁxed plane of propagation

In the previous section, by considering plane wave propagation in an unbounded medium, we found

the various geometric forms of the dispersion surfaces. At a specularly ﬂat interface between two

half-spaces ﬁlled with linear homogeneous materials, the tangential components of the wavevectors

of the incident, transmitted and reﬂected plane waves must all be equal, and consequently, they all

must lie in the same plane that is orthogonal to the interface. This plane is the plane of propagation.

Let us now investigate the kinds of dispersion curves obtained when dispersion surfaces of the kind

identiﬁed in Section 2 intersect by a speciﬁc plane of propagation, arbitrarily oriented with respect

to the optic axis ˆc.

Without loss of generality, let the xy plane be the ﬁxed plane of propagation in a cartesian
coordinate system; furthermore, let ˆc = cx ˆx + cy ˆy + cz ˆz and ~k = kx ˆx + ky ˆy. The dispersion equation

(2), for electric modes, can then be rewritten as the quadratic equation

The dispersion equation (3) for magnetic modes also has the same quadratic form, but now the

The symmetric matrix

corresponding to the quadratic equation (8) is deﬁned by its three elements. This matrix can be

diagonalized by rotating the xy plane about the z axis by a certain angle, thereby eliminating the
kxky term in (8). With ˆv1 and ˆv2 denoting the orthonormalized eigenvectors of the matrix ˜M , we
can write ~k = k1ˆv1 + k2ˆv2. Likewise, with

denoting the eigenvalues of ˜M , we get the dispersion curve

of λ1, λ2 and F . In particular,

The dispersion curves for the mode represented by (12) can be classiﬁed by analyzing the signs

(i) if λ1, λ2 and F all have the same sign, then the dispersion curve in the ﬁxed plane of

propagation is an ellipse, with semiaxes along the directions ˆv1 and ˆv2;

(ii) if λ1 and λ2 have both the same sign, but F has the opposite sign, then the mode represented

by (12) is of the evanescent kind;

along the directions ˆv1 and ˆv2;

(iii) if λ1 and λ2 have opposite signs, then the dispersion curve is a hyperbola, with semiaxes

(iv) if one eigenvalue is equal to zero and the other (nonzero) eigenvalue has the same sign as F ,

then the dispersion curve is a straight line, parallel to the eigenvector associated with the null

eigenvalue.

Illustrative numerical results and discussion

To illustrate the diﬀerent possibilities for the dispersion curves, let us present numerical results for

the following two cases:

Case I: ǫ⊥ =

2.1, ǫk = 1.9, µ⊥ = 1.3 and µk =

1.6;

−

−

Case II: ǫ⊥ = 2.1, ǫk =

1.9, µ⊥ =

1.3 and µk = 1.6.

−

−

Both constitutive tensors thus are chosen to be indeﬁnite. According to Table 1, the electric and

magnetic modes for both Case I and Case II have dispersion surfaces in the form of one–sheet

hyperboloids of revolution, whose intersections with ﬁxed planes of propagation are circles, ellipses,

hyperbolas or straight lines — depending on the orientation of ˆc.

Furthermore, to show the usefulness of our analysis in visualizing dispersion curves for boundary

value problems, let us now consider that the anisotropic medium is illuminated by a plane wave

from a vacuous half–space, the plane of incidence being the xy plane. In terms of (a) the angle θc

7

between the optic axis and the y axis and (b) the angle ϕc between the x axis and the projection

of the optic axis onto the xy plane, the optic axis can be stated as

ˆc = ˆx sin θc cos ϕc + ˆy cos θc + ˆz sin θc sin ϕc ,

and the eigenvalues λE

j , corresponding to electric modes can be written as

λE

(cid:27)

For Case I, F E < 0, λE

2 = ǫ⊥ < 0, whereas the sign of λE

1 depends on the optic axis orientation.

From (14) we conclude for the electric modes as follows:

The same conclusions hold for magnetic modes in Case II.

Let ϕc > 0◦ so that the optic axis is not wholly contained in the plane of incidence. There

exist critical values of θc at which the dispersion curve change from hyperbolic/elliptic to ellip-

tic/hyperbolic. By virtue of (16), the critical value for electric modes is given by

for magnetic modes emerges from (20). Expressions (22) and (23) are valid for both Cases I and

II. At a critical value of θc, the dispersion curve for the corresponding mode is a straight line.

Suppose ϕc = 60◦, so that θE

c = 52.73◦ and θM

c = 59.06◦. Then, for θc = θE

c the dispersion

curves in the plane of incidence are straight lines (electric modes) and hyperbolas (magnetic modes);

whereas for θc = θM

•

θc = 20◦ (both dispersion curves hyperbolic),

θc = θE

c = 52.73◦ (electric type linear and magnetic type hyperbolic),

θc = 55◦ (electric type elliptic and magnetic type hyperbolic), and

9

θc = θM

c = 59.06◦ (electric type elliptic and magnetic type linear).

•

For θc > θM

c = 59.06◦, modes of both electric and magnetic types have elliptic dispersion curves —
just as for a natural crystal (not shown). The light gray circle in Figure 2 represents the dispersion

equation for plane waves in vacuum (the medium of incidence).

For θc = 20◦, Figure 2a indicates the nonexistence of real–valued ky in the refracting anisotropic

medium for either the electric or the magnetic modes, the speciﬁc kx being indicated by a dashed

vertical line in the ﬁgure. This is true for both Cases I and II, for any angle of incidence (with respect

to the y axis), and for any incident polarization state; hence, the chosen anisotropic medium behaves

as an omnidirectional total reﬂector [10]. As the present–day construction of NPV metamaterials

is such that the boundary is periodically stepped [24], it is worth noting that the introduction of

a periodic modulation along the surface would subvert the omnidirectional reﬂector eﬀect, since

a periodic modulation allows for the presence of spatial harmonics with tangential components

of their wavevectors that can now satisfy the required matching condition. Gratings of this kind,

contrary to what happens for all gratings made of conventional materials, have been recently shown

to support an inﬁnite number of refracted channels [17, 18].

When θc = θE

c = 52.73◦ the dispersion equation for refracted modes of the electric type is linear.
It is posible to ﬁnd two wavevectors with real–valued components that satisfy the phase–matching

condition (the so–called Snell’s law) at the interface, one belonging to the upper straight line and

the other to the lower straight line in Figure 2b. As the direction of the time–averaged Poynting

vector associated with electric modes is given by [20]

~S =

ω ǫ⊥
8π ǫk

(~k

×

ˆc)2 ˜ǫ

~k ,

·

(24)

we conclude that the refracted wavevectors on the upper straight line do not satisfy the radiation

condition for Case I, whereas wavevectors on the lower straight line do not satisfy the radiation

condition for Case II.

The direction of ~S given by (24) for modes of the electric type is normal to the dispersion curves

and points towards y < 0, as required by the radiation condition. Ray directions coincide with
the direction of ~S. As for the parameters considered in our examples, the z component of the

time–averaged Poynting vector does not vanish, the ray directions are not contained in the plane

of incidence. The projections of the refracted rays onto the xy plane (indicated by little arrows in

10

the ﬁgures) are perpendicular to the straight lines and independent of the angle of incidence.

For refracted modes of the magnetic type and for the angle of incidence (= sin−1 kx/ko) shown

in Figure 2b, it is also posible to ﬁnd two refracted wavevectors with real–valued components

satisfying the phase–matching condition at the interface, one belonging to the upper hyperbola

(not shown) and the other to the lower hyperbola. The time–averaged Poynting vector associated

with the magnetic modes is given by

~S =

ω

·

(25)

Therefore, we conclude that wavevectors on the upper hyperbola do not satisfy the radiation condi-

tion for Case II, whereas wavevectors on the lower hyperbola do not satisfy the radiation condition
for Case I. Ray directions coincide with the direction of ~S given by 25, which again has a non–zero

component in the z direction. Ray projections onto the xy plane (indicated by little arrows in the

ﬁgures) are perpendicular to the hyperbolas.

The interface for both Cases I and II acts as a positively refracting interface for modes of both

types, in the sense that the refracted rays never emerge on the same side of the normal as the

incident ray [22].

When the angle θc is increased to 55◦ (Figure 2c), the dispersion equation for the refracted

modes of the magnetic type is still hyperbolic, but the dispersion equation for the electric type is

elliptic. Again, for both electric and magnetic modes, is it possible to ﬁnd two wavevectors with

acceptable real–valued components. From (24), we conclude that refracted electric modes on the

upper part of the ellipse correspond to Case II, whereas electric wavevectors on the lower part of

the ellipse correspond to Case I. On the other hand, wavevectors for the refracted magnetic modes

on the upper hyperbola do not satisfy the radiation condition for Case II, whereas wavevectors on

the lower hyperbola do not satisfy the radiation condition for Case I, as can be deduced from (25).

Ray projections onto the xy plane corresponding to the magnetic modes alone are shown in the

ﬁgure, for the sake of clarity. For both Cases I and II and for refracted modes of the electric and

magnetic types, the refracted rays never emerge on the same side of the y axis as the incident ray,

just as for positively refracting interfaces.

When θc = θM

c = 59.06◦ (Figure 2d), the dispersion curves for the refracted modes of the
electric type continue to be ellipses, but now the dispersion curves for the modes of the magnetic

11

type become straight lines. For the electric modes, the selection of the wavevectors is identical to

that in Figure 2c. For the refracted magnetic modes, wavevectors on the upper straight line do not

satisfy the radiation condition for Case II, whereas wavevectors on the lower straight line do not

satisfy the radiation condition for Case I.

Ray projections onto the xy plane for the refracted magnetic modes are also drawn in the ﬁgure.

Again, for both Cases I and II the surface acts as a positively refracting interface for modes of both

types.

5 Concluding remarks

This work focused on the geometric representation at a ﬁxed frequency of the dispersion surface
ω(~k) for lossless, homogeneous dielectric–magnetic uniaxial materials. To encompass both natural

crystals and the artiﬁcial composites used to demonstrate negative refraction (metamaterials), we

assumed that the elements of the permittivity and permeability tensors characterizing the material

can have any sign. We showed that, depending on a particular combination of the elements of these

tensors, the propagating electromagnetic modes supported by the material can exhibit dispersion

surfaces in the form of (a) ellipsoids of revolution, (b) hyperboloids of one sheet, or (c) hyperboloids

of two sheets. Intersections of these surfaces with ﬁxed planes of propagation lead to circles, ellipses,

hyperbolas or straight lines, depending on the relative orientation of the optic axis. This analysis

was used to discuss the reﬂection and refraction of electromagnetic plane waves due to a planar

interface with vacuum (or any linear, homogeneous, isotropic, dielectric–magnetic medium).

Table 1: Types of possible dispersion surfaces for diﬀerent combinations between the eigenvalues
ǫ⊥, ǫk, µ⊥ and µk of the real symmetric tensors ˜ǫ and ˜µ. The ﬁrst symbol indicates the mode: E
(electric) or M (magnetic). The second symbol indicates the geometrical form of the dispersion
surface: e (ellipsoids of revolution), h1 (hyperboloid of one sheet), h2 (hyperboloid of two sheets).
The symbol n indicates that the corresponding mode is of the evanescent (i.e., nonpropagating)
kind.

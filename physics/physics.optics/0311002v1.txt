This note is concerned with the connections between the conformal group and the quantum
states of photons. It is shown that there exist analogies between the photonic quantum states and
the conformal group, namely, the time-development operator (with a free Hamiltonian), displace-
ment and squeezing operators of the vacuum state corresponds to the dilatation, translation, proper
Lorentz transformations, respectively, and that the three quantum states of photons (i.e., Fock state,
coherent state and squeezed state) in quantum optics thus bear some analogy to the above three
transformations in the conformal group. Based on this comparison, we argue by analogy that if
the phase transformation operators acting on a vacuum state (hence the Fock state, coherent state
and squeezed state are generated) are truly exactly analogous to the conformal transformations,
then a fourth quantum state of photons (referred to as the conformal state), which corresponds to
the special conformal transformation (acceleration transformation) and will therefore be of special
physical interest, can be suggested.

Keywords: photonic quantum state, conformal state

I. THE 15-PARAMETER CONFORMAL GROUP

The group under consideration is the 15-parameter Lie group often referred to as “conformal transformation” [1,2],
which is deﬁned as the set of those transformations that transforms ﬂat space into ﬂat space. The conformal group
consists of the space-time translations (x′µ = xµ + αµ, 4 parameters), the proper homogeneous Lorentz transforma-
tions (i.e., the Lorentz rotation, x′µ = Λµ
ν xν , 6 parameters), the dilatation (or scale) transformation (x′µ = sxµ,
1 parameter) and the special conformal (acceleration) transformation (x′µ = (1 + 2aαxα + x2a2)−1(xµ + aµx2), 4
parameters). The corresponding algebraic generators can be realized in terms of the diﬀerential operators acting on
the Minkowski space, which are as follows [1]:

Pµ = i∂µ

(translation),

Mµν = i(xµ∂ν − xν∂µ)

D = ixν∂ν
Kµ = i(2xµxν ∂ν − x2∂µ)

(Lorentz
(dilatation transformation),

transformation),

(special

conformal

transformation).

The algebraic commuting relations of the above 15 generators are given [1]

[Pµ, Pν ] = 0,
[Pµ, D] = iPµ,

[Pλ, Mµν] = i(gµλPν − gνλPµ),
[Pµ, Kν] = 2i(gµνD − Mµν ),

[D, Mµν] = 0,

[D, Kµ] = iKµ,

[Mµν, Mσρ] = i(gµρMνσ + gνσMµρ + gµσMρν + gνρMσµ),

[Kµ, Kν] = 0,

[Kλ, Mµν] = i(gµλKν − gνλKµ).

In what follows we will concern ourselves with the unitary phase transformation operators in the photonic quantum
states, i.e., the Fock state, coherent state and squeezed state.

∗This note is mainly devoted to a physically interesting comparison between the photonic quantum states and the conformal
group. Because of the trivial and lengthy calculation involved, the detailed analysis of comparison made between photonic
states and conformal transformations will be submitted nowhere else for publication, just uploaded at the e-print archives.

II. PHOTONIC QUANTUM STATES

Historically, the fundamental concepts of the Fock state, coherent state and squeezed state were proposed by Dirac,
Glauber and Stoler [3–5], respectively. In this section we will take into a comprehensive consideration these three
photonic quantum states and discuss several topics such as the unitary phase transformation operators, the generators
and the algebraic structures in quantum states of photons as well as the close relation to the conformal transformation
[6].

A. Free-Hamiltonian time-evolution operator in Fock state

The operators a†a and aa† may be considered the generators of the Free-Hamiltonian time-evolution operator of

photon state, which is of the form

P (α) = exp(αa†a − α∗aa†), P †(α) = exp[−(αa†a − α∗aa†)].

The unitary transformation operator P (α) leads to the following transformation

a → a′ = P †(α)aP (α) = exp(α∗ − α)a,

a† → a′† = P †(α)a†P (α) = exp[−(α∗ − α)]a†,

and consequently the inﬁnitesimal variations of a and a† under the transformation P (α) are
δa = (α∗ − α)a,

δa† = −(α∗ − α)a†,

which follows that δa, a† and the inﬁnitesimal variations of space-time coordinates

δxµ =

αDxµ = αxµ

1
i

under the dilatation transformation are alike in some way. The new states generated by the dilatation transformation
P (α) are written

|α, 0i = P (α)|0i = exp(α∗)|0i,

|α, ni = P (α)|ni = exp[(α∗ − α)a†a] exp(α∗)|ni.

It follows that |α, ni = P (α)|ni = exp[n(α∗ − α)] exp(α∗)|ni. It is known that the quantum state |α, ni can be realized
by the time evolution with a free Hamiltonian H = ω
2 (aa† + a†a) (governed by the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation), namely, |t, ni = exp[ 1
2 )ωt]|ni. If the parameters in the unitary transformation operator P (α) are
taken

i (n + 1

α = −

ωt, α∗ =

ωt,

1
2i

2i

then |t, ni will be the photonic states characterized in (7). Thus it is concluded that the free-Hamiltonian time-
evolution operator acting on the photon creation and annihilation operators closely resembles the dilatation (or
scale) transformation in the conformal group, and that a stationary Fock state acted upon by the free-Hamiltonian
time-evolution operator P (α) will be transformed into a time-dependent Fock state.

B. Displacement operator in coherent state

The coherent state of photons is deﬁned to be |αi = D(α)|0i with the displacement operator being

D(α) = exp(αa† − α∗a).

The displacement operator acting on the vacuum state is equivalent to the following transformation

a → a′ = D†(α)aD(α) = a + α,

a† → a′† = D†(α)a†D(α) = a† + α∗,

which will yield the inﬁnitesimal variations

It is physically interesting that the above δa and δa† are in analogy with the variations of the space-time coordinates
xµ under the inﬁnitesimal translation transformation in the conformal group, i.e.,

III. DEFINING A KIND OF OPERATOR INTEGRAL TO OBTAIN THE GENERATORS OF QUANTUM
STATES OF PHOTONS

In this section, we will deﬁne a kind of operator integral technique to get the algebraic generators of the above

three quantum states of photons.

(with c-number α and α∗ being the integrands)

The generators of displacement operator D(α) = exp(αa† − α∗a) can be obtained via the following two integrals

α∗a =

α∗da, αa† =

αda†,

Z

Z

where the integral constant (unit matrix) is omitted due to its triviality. In (17) we obtain the linear-form operators
(generators) a and a†.

In the similar fashion, we calculate the following operator integrals (note that the deﬁnition of the operator integral

is implied in the following calculation)

F =

IV. CUBIC-NONLINEARITY PHASE TRANSFORMATION OPERATOR

It is of physical interest to consider the so-called cubic-nonlinearity phase transformation operator C(̺), which is

deﬁned to be

In the meanwhile, we deﬁne a new photonic quantum state as follows

that is, the two-dimensional inﬁnitesimal special conformal transformation is of the form

Accordingly, here we may take into account the special conformal transformation in the conformal group, i.e.,

It follows that the quantum state C(̺)|0i and the special conformal transformation (characterized by the generators
Kµ’s) are alike in some way. If, for example, in the particular case the two-dimensional inﬁnitesimal parameters agree
with ̺0 = −̺1, and ̺ = ̺∗, then the two variations (25) and (27) are of the same mathematical form. Both (25)
and (27) are their respective extensions of this same special case. Thus we may think of |̺i = C(̺)|0i as the fourth
quantum state of photons and refer to it as the optical conformal state. Diﬀering from the three photonic quantum
states studied previously, the conformal state is a nonlinear one. It is reasonably believed that such quantum state
may be of special physical interest and deserves further investigation.

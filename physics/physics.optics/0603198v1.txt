Abstract The coherence length of the thermal electromagnetic ﬁeld near a planar
surface has a minimum value related to the nonlocal dielectric response of the
material. We perform two model calculations of the electric energy density and the
ﬁeld’s degree of spatial coherence. Above a polar crystal, the lattice constant gives
the minimum coherence length. It also gives the upper limit to the near ﬁeld energy
density, cutting off its 1/z3 divergence. Near an electron plasma described by the
semiclassical Lindhard dielectric function, the corresponding length scale is ﬁxed
by plasma screening to the Thomas-Fermi length. The electron mean free path,
however, sets a larger scale where signiﬁcant deviations from the local description
are visible.

1 Introduction

Thermal electromagnetic radiation in vacuum, as described by the celebrated black-
dody spectrum discovered by Max Planck [1], is usually taken as a typical example
of incoherent radiation. This is not quite true, however: if the radiation is detected
at a given frequency, it is spatially coherent on a scale set by the wavelength [2,3].
When one approaches a macroscopic object, the radiation spectrum and its coher-
ence is profoundly changed, depending on the properties of the object. For exam-
ple, if the object supports resonant modes like surface plasmon polaritons, the ﬁeld
is coherent across the propagation length of these modes [4]. The opposite case is
possible as well: the coherence length becomes comparable to the observation dis-
tance, much smaller than the wavelength, close to an absorbing object with a local

dielectric function [5]. It has been suggested already by Rytov and colleagues that
this behaviour is an artefact because at some small scale, nonlocal effects must
come into play [2]. This is what we discuss in this paper in a semi-quantitative
way. We use two models for nonlocal dielectric functions and identify the scale
for the ﬁeld’s coherence length using explicit asymptotic formulas. A nonlocal di-
electric response is of primary importance for semiconductor quantum wells, see
for example Ref.[6], but the issue of spatial coherence has not been analyzed in
this context, to our knowledge.

We focus on the spatial coherence of the electromagnetic ﬁeld at nanometer
distance in the vacuum (medium 1) above a solid material (medium 2). We chose a
planar geometry which is sufﬁciently simple to allow for an essentially analytical
description, thus avoiding the need for extensive numerics. On the other hand,
many effects have been discussed in this setting: the ﬂuorescence rate of molecules
near metals and thin ﬁlms [7], scanning near-ﬁeld microscopy of sub-wavelength
objects deposited on a substrate [8], the momentum exchange between a tip and
a sample (related to the Casimir force, see, e.g., [9]) and the energy exchange
between a tip and a sample [10,11,12,13].

where the average is taken in a stationary statistical ensemble (thermal equilibrium
in the simplest case). We focus in the following on the cross-correlation spectrum
Eij(r1, r2; ω) and a frequency in the infrared to visible range. Far from any sources
and in global equilibrium, the corresponding wavelength λ = 2πc/ω sets the scale
for the ﬁeld’s spatial coherence length: the cross-correlations tend to zero if the
distance
exceeds λ. In the vicinity of a source, the coherence length ℓcoh
signiﬁcantly differs from λ, as Henkel and co-workers have shown previously [5],
and it changes with the observation point.

frequency arguments in the following.

2.2 Planar surface with local response

In a previous paper, Henkel and co-workers have shown that in the vacuum above
a planar dielectric surface at temperature T , described by a local permittivity ε2,
the spatial coherence function is of the form [5] (see also [18,19])

Eij (r1, r2) =

where Θ(ω, T ) = ¯hω/(e¯hω/kT
1). We assume that the ﬁeld is observed in
vacuum (relative permittivity ε1 = 1). The surface is given by z = 0. We have
chosen the x-axis such that r1 −

quantity ˜r2 = ρ2 + (z1 + z2)2 is the (squared) distance between r1 and the image
point of r2 across the interface.

Eq.(4) applies to leading order when both distances z1, z2 are much smaller
than the wavelength λ; for other regimes and higher order corrections, see Ref.[5]
and, at ρ = 0, Ref.[20]. In the following, we focus on the correlation function at a
constant height z = z1 = z2 and discuss its dependence on the lateral separation
ρ; note that ρ can be positive or negative. The normalized coherence function (4)
is qualitatively similar to a Lorentzian: the yy-component, for example, follows
3/2. The spatial coherence length is thus equal to z, and
a law
decreases without apparent limitation as the surface is approached. The electric
energy density derived from (4) diverges like 1/z3:
uE(z) = [Θ(ω, T )/(8π z3)]Im[(ε2 −

[4z2 + ρ2]−

1)/(ε2 + 1)].

Both points have been noted by Rytov and co-workers [2], who have also argued
that this unphysical result is due to the assumption of a local dielectric response
down to the smallest scales. A cutoff would occur naturally in a non-local treat-
ment or taking into account the atomistic structure of the material. This is what
we show here in detail, using two different model calculations. Doing this, we also
provide a basis for the phenomenological cutoff introduced recently by Kittel and
co-workers [13] in the context of heat transfer from a hot, sharp tip into a cold,
planar substrate.

2.3 Overview

We will use two models to calculate the coherence function. In both, we focus,
as mentioned before, on the ﬁelds near a planar surface and compute the ﬁeld
correlations in the vacuum above it, at sub-wavelength distances.

Carsten Henkel1, Karl Joulain2

The ﬁrst model is based on the ﬂuctuation electrodynamics introduced by Ry-
tov and co-workers [2] where the sources of the ﬁeld are described by ﬂuctuating
polarization currents below the surface. This approach relies on the ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem that links the spectrum of the polarization current to the di-
electric function of the material below the surface. We argue that the currents are
spatially correlated on a scale equal to or larger than the material’s microscopic lat-
tice constant. We then show that the radiation generated outside the surface shows
a minimum coherence length given by this scale; this cuts off the divergences ap-
pearing in a local description of the material, as noted in Refs.[2,13]. This model
can be applied to polar ionic crystals in the frequency domain where the dielec-
tric response is dominated by phonon-polariton resonances. It can also cover a
non-equilibrium situation where the surface is heated to a different temperature or
shows weak temperature gradients [21,22].

The second model describes the dielectric response of an electron plasma and
applies to the plasmon-polariton resonances occurring in metals. We use here di-
rectly the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem for the electric ﬁeld [23,24], restricting
ourselves to a ﬁeld-matter system in “global equilibrium”. The coherence func-
tion is determined by reﬂection coefﬁcients from the surface for which we take the
Lindhard form, taking into account the non-local response of the electron plasma.
It is shown that the ﬁeld’s coherence length is limited by the Thomas-Fermi screen-
ing length, but signiﬁcant deviations from the local description occur already on
the (typically larger) scale of the electron mean free path.

3.1 Current correlations

We assume here that the ﬂuctuating currents that generate the radiation ﬁeld, are
correlated below a certain distance l. Above this distance, the medium response
can be considered as local. A lower limit for l is certainly the lattice period a:
at scales smaller than a, the concept of a continuous material characterized by a
dielectric constant does not make sense any more.

In this situation, the cross correlation spectrum of the ﬂuctuating currents,
as given by the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem, is no longer delta-correlated in
space. We choose here to smoothen the spatial delta fonction into a gaussian. The
ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem for the currents thus takes the form

for convenience; another functional dependence, e.g. the model put forward by
Kliewer and Fuchs [25], will lead to qualitatively similar results.

functions and the currents. We use the convention

To proceed further in the calculation, the Green function is written as a Weyl plane
wave expansion ([26] and appendix). In the present case, the Green function relates
the current on one side of an interface to the electric ﬁeld on the other side of the
interface. It depends on the Fresnel transmission coefﬁcients through this interface.

The cross-spectral correlation function depends on four characteristic lengths:
the wavelength λ, the distance to the interface z, the locality distance l and the
separation ρ between the ﬁeld points. The latter is the variable considered in our
problem. At the wavelengths we work with, we always have l

We note in passing that we use our calculation is based on the solution to
the transmission problem valid for a local medium. Actually, this solution applies
when the wave vector K is smaller than 1/l when the medium can be described
as homogeneous. But from (8) one sees that whatever the values of z, there is
anyway a cut-off in the integration over K at approximately 1/l. Therefore, one
might consider that the local expression of the Fresnel coefﬁcients remains valid.
We believe that our model, even if it not rigorously accurate, is useful in view of
the insight one gains from the analytic result.

To summarize this section, we have shown that when we take into account the
non-local nature of matter by introducing a locality length l for the sources of the
ﬁeld, the correlation length is about l when the distance to the interface z < l.
In this regime, the energy density saturates to a value given by the electrostatic
energy density expression taken in z = l.

4 Nonlocal plasma

We consider in this section another simple situation where the ﬁeld correlation
function can be calculated fairly easily. Restricting ourselves to a ﬁeld in thermal
equilibrium between ﬁeld and surface, we use directly the ﬂuctuation-dissipation
theorem for the ﬁeld. The relevant information is thus encoded in the electric Green
tensor (i.e., the ﬁeld’s response function). The Green tensor contains a part due to
the reﬂection from the surface that is actually dominating in the sub-wavelength
distance regime we are interested in. We ﬁrst review the corresponding reﬂection
coefﬁcients for an electron plasma, taking into account the ﬁnite response time
of the electrons and their scattering. These two effects make the plasma behave
like a nonlocal medium and give rise to the so-called anomalous skin effect. We
then discuss the large-wavevector asymptotics of the reﬂection coefﬁcients and
the corresponding limits on the spatial coherence function. It turns out that the
scattering mean free path is one key quantity that limits the coherence length at
short observation distances.

4.1 Reﬂection coefﬁcients

We focus here on the electronic contribution to the dielectric function and describe
the background ions, interband absorption etc. by a local permittivity εb to avoid
unnecessary complications. As is well known [29], the dielectric function of a bulk
plasma is actually a tensor with two distinct spatial Fourier coefﬁcients, a “longi-
tudinal” εl(q) and a “transverse” εt(q) where q is the modulus of the wavevector.
(As before, we suppress the frequency dependence for simplicity.) The ﬁelds out-
side the metal surface are characterized by the reﬂection coefﬁcients rs,p(K) that
depend only on the magnitude K =
of the incident wavevector projected onto
|
the interface. Out of the two polarizations s and p, we need in the following only
ω/c. This coefﬁcient is given, e.g., in

e, m the electron

From the nonlocal permittivity (13–15), two characteristic length scales can be
read off: the mean free path lmfp = vF /ν and vF /ω, the maximum distance over
which an electron at the Fermi energy can move ballistically during one period
of the applied electric ﬁeld. In the following, we use the complex length ℓ =
vF /(ω + iν) deﬁned in (14) to simplify the notation.

The Lindhard formula, Eqs. (13–15), is based on a semiclassical description
of the electron gas (classical particles with Fermi statistics) with a damping rate
ν and a velocity vF at the Fermi energy. This description is valid as long as q is
much smaller than the Fermi wave vector kF = mvF /¯h. Our model thus applies
reasonably well to a “clean metal” where the mean free path is much longer than
the Fermi wavelength, and to distances above 1/kF (typically a few ˚A). Ref.[30]
gives a more general dielectric function that covers the regime q

kF as well.

Eq.(18) can be carried out, and we get Eq.(4) with its unphysical 1/z3 divergence.
The same divergence would be obtained here from the background permittivity
εb that we assume local. To focus on the nonlocal contribution from the electron
plasma, we consider the regime where εb is real so that the leading-order, local
contribution analogous to Eq.(4) vanishes.

a screening length on the order of vF /Ω plus an imaginary correction.

From the integral (12) for the surface impedance, we ﬁnd that the typical

for a nonlocal metallic surface that was recently pointed out [34]. The reﬂection

Fig. 4 Electric energy density, normalized to its far-ﬁeld value, vs. normalized distance
Ωz/vF . Dashed line: local dielectric. Solid line: numerical calculation (left: ω = 0.8 ν;
right: ω = 0.55 Ω; other parameters as in Fig.3). The arrows mark, from left to right, the
characteristic distances Λ, |ℓ|, and λ = 2πc/ω.

We note that for typical metals, the Thomas-Fermi scale Λ does not differ
much from the Fermi wavelength 1/kF . The asymptotics derived above within
the semiclassical Lindhard model (13) is therefore only qualitatively valid at short
distances (large wavevectors).

4.5 Energy density and lateral coherence

The numerical calculation of the correlation function Eq.(18) can be done efﬁ-
ciently using a numerical interpolation of Im rp(K) that we continue for large and
small K using the asymptotics derived above.

We plot in Fig.4 the electric energy density as a function of distance, for the
same two frequencies as in Fig.3. Deviations from the local approximation (dashed
ν,
line) occur at distances smaller than
left panel), suppression near the surface plasmon resonance (right panel), which is
consistent with the trends seen in Fig.3. A saturation at small distances is also vis-
ible, although it occurs for fairly small values of Ωz/vF (where the semi-classical
λ, the
Lindhard function is in practice no longer valid). We note also that for z
plots are only qualitative since the calculation does not take into account retarda-
tion.

Finally, we illustrate the ﬁniteness of the coherence length as the distance of
observation enters the nonlocal regime. We plot in Fig.5 the zz-component of the
normalized coherence tensor (3), as a function of the lateral separation ρ/z. In
the local regime, one gets a universal curve independent of the distance (dashed
line). This is no longer true near a nonlocal metal: when Thomas-Fermi screening
Λ), the coherence function departs from its local limit, its width (the
sets in (z
coherence length) becoming much larger than z.

5 Concluding remarks

We have discussed in this paper the impact of a nonlocal dielectric response on the
spatial coherence of thermal electromagnetic near ﬁelds above a planar surface.
Using two different models to describe the nonlocal response, we have shown that
when the sources of the ﬁeld have a ﬁnite correlation length, this length sets the
minimum scale for the coherence length of the ﬁeld as well. This behaviour is
qualitatively similar to what we found previously when investigating the contribu-
tion of thermally excited surface plasmons where coherence length and plasmon
propagation length coincide [5]. We have thus provided semi-quantitative evidence
for the impact of nonlocality that has been conjectured already by Rytov’s group
[2].

The calculation for an electron plasma model highlights, on the one hand, the
crucial role played by Thomas-Fermi screening, that sets the minimum coherence
length. On the other hand, signiﬁcant deviations from the local description already
occur at scales below the electron mean free path (Fig.3 and Fig.4), although these
are not accompanied by an increase in spatial coherence.

Our calculations can be improved taking into account quantum effects in the
Lindhard dielectric function [30], which will lead to quantitative changes at short
distance. Indeed, for typical metals, the Thomas-Fermi screening length vF /Ω and
the Fermi wavelength 1/kF are fairly close [29]. A comparison to other models
of nonlocal dielectric functions would be interesting as well. On the experimental
side, it would be interesting to compare the recent data on heat transfer between a
scanning tip and a surface [13] with a microscopic calculation along the lines used
here. We also mention that in the context of the Casimir force, nonlocal surface
impedances have been studied. The nonlocal correction is particularly relevant
at ﬁnite temperature and large distances and leads to a behaviour of the Casimir

14

force that is qualitatively similar, even without absorption, to the local, lossy Drude
model, see for example Refs.[35,36]. Finally, it remains to study the impact of
another property of real metals, the smooth rather than abrupt transition of the
electron density proﬁle at the surface: this can be described by effective surface
displacements that depend on both polarization and wave vector, thus adding to
the nonlocal effects considered here [37].

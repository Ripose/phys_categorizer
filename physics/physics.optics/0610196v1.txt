We analyze electromagnetic modes in multi-layered nano-composites and demonstrate that the
response of a majority of practical layered structures is strongly aﬀected by the eﬀective non-
localities, and is not described by conventional eﬀective-medium theories. We develop the analytical
description of the relevant phenomena and conﬁrm our results with numerical solutions of Maxwell
equations. Finally, we use the developed formalism to demonstrate that multi-layered plasmonic
nanostructures support high-index volume modes, conﬁned to deep subwavelength areas.

PACS numbers:

Nanolayered composites have been recently proposed to
serve as negative index systems, super- and hyper-lenses,
photonic funnels, and other nanophotonic structures[1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The typical thickness
of an individual layer in these “artiﬁcial” (meta-) ma-
terials is of the order of 10nm. Since this size is much
smaller than optical (or IR) wavelength, it is commonly
assumed that the properties of the multilayered compos-
ites are well-described by the eﬀective medium theory
(EMT)[12, 13]. In this Letter, we analyze the modes of
realistic multi-layered structures and show that the con-
ventional EMT fails to adequately describe these modes
due to the metamaterial analog of spatial dispersion –
strong variation of the ﬁeld on the scale of a single layer.
We derive a non-local correction to EMT, bridging the
gap between metamaterial- and photonic crystal-regimes
of multi-layered media, and use numerical solutions of
Maxwell equations to verify our results. Finally, we use
the developed technique to identify volume metamaterial
modes conﬁned to nanoscale areas.

While the formalism developed below is applicable to
the composites with arbitrary values of permittivities, we
illustrate the developed technique on the example of plas-
monic nanolayered composite – the major component of
a variety of beam-steering and imaging systems[3, 4, 11].
The schematic geometry of such a structure, containing
alternating layers of materials with permittivities, ǫ1, ǫ2
and (average) thicknesses a1 and a2 respectively, is shown
in Fig.1. In the analytical results presented below, we fo-
cus on the propagation of TM waves, which are respon-
sible for plasmon-assisted phenomena, and postpone the
straightforward generalization of our approach for TE,
and mixed waves as well as for multi-component struc-

coordinate axis is perpendicular to the plane deﬁned by
layer interfaces, while y and z axes are parallel to this
plane; the direction of z axis is chosen so that that the

electromagnetic waves propagate in x, z plane.
The majority of practical realizations of

layered
nanoplasmonic structures rely on the metamaterial
regime, when the typical layer thickness is much smaller
than the free-space wavelength λ so that surface plas-
mon polaritons propagating on diﬀerent metal-dielectric
interfaces are strongly coupled to each other. Apart from
the wavelength, two more independent length-scales can
be identiﬁed in the system – the one of the typical layer
thickness a ∼ a1, a2, and the one of the typical ﬁeld vari-
ation L. Since the introduction of eﬀective permittivity
ǫeﬀ requires some kind of ﬁeld averaging, independence of
L and λ yields to a fundamental diﬀerence between the
metamaterial[12] and eﬀective-medium[13] responses of
nano-composites. As we show below, in nanoplasmonic
layered structures L . λ so that ǫeﬀ will have non-local
corrections.

As any optical system, the multi-layered composite
can be described by the behavior of its resonant (eigen)
modes. Each such mode is characterized by eﬀective
modal index, given by neﬀ = kzc/ω with kz and c being
the modal wavevector and speed of light in the vacuum
respectively. An arbitrary wave propagating through the
system can be represented as a linear combination of dif-
ferent modes. Note that when n2
eﬀ > 0 exceeds that of

precision arithmetic is required to ﬁnd the accurate nu-
merical solution of Maxwell equations.
It is seen that
as the number of layers is increased, the ﬁeld distribu-
tion in the system converges to the one of the mode in
a waveguide with homogeneous core. Therefore, in this
regime the behavior of a multilayered composite is essen-
tially identical to the behavior of a uniaxial anisotropic
system with eﬀective permittivity tensor ǫeﬀ , given by
< Dα >= ǫeﬀ
αβ < Eβ >, with Greek indices correspond-
ing to Cartesian components and <> being the average
over the multi-layer subwavelength area[13]. Due to ax-
ial symmetry, ǫeﬀ is diagonal, its optical axis of coincides

are summarized in Fig.3. It is clearly seen that similar to
what has been shown for ﬁber geometry in[6], the planar
multi-layered composite supports highly-conﬁned volume
modes. It is also seen that while the response of all struc-
tures in a single ensemble is very alike, and therefore the
introduction of eﬀective permittivity is justiﬁed, conven-
tional EMT fails to describe the behavior of majority of
practical nanolayered composites. A reasonable agree-
ment is present only when the number of layers is very
large. Note that the EMT does not work despite the fact
that the condition a1,2 ≪ λ is met.

The origin of this eﬀect lies in a strong variation of the
ﬁelds on the scale of a single layer, clearly visible in Fig.2.
Similar to the strong ﬁeld variation on the subatomic
scale that yields non-local corrections to permittivities
of homogeneous materials[13], the scale separation L < λ
introduces non-locality into ǫeﬀ. Note that in contrast to
the case of non-local response in homogeneous structures,
the microscopic (layer-speciﬁc) ﬁeld in meta-material can
still be described by “local” ǫ1,2; “eﬀective” non-locality
is present only in the eﬀective permittivity.

To ﬁnd the non-local correction to the EMT, we start
from the layered metal-dielectric structure where all
metallic and all dielectric layers have the same thickness

(see text for details); Ez ﬁeld is shown

both cladding layers, the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a mode
is conﬁned inside the layered structure, which behaves
like a waveguide.

To analyze the electromagnetism in the metamaterial,
we numerically solve 3D Maxwell equations in the lay-
ered geometry using the Transfer Matrix Method.
In
this technique, described in details in [14], the ﬁeld in
each layer is represented as a combination of two (plane)
waves having the same dependence in z direction and
propagating in the opposite x directions, followed by the
construction of a transfer matrix describing the collec-
tive response of the multi-layered structure. The modes
of the metamaterial are then related to the eigen values
and eigenvectors of the transfer matrix.

To understand the evolution of multilayered system
between meta-material and eﬀective-medium regimes,
we used the transfer-matrix techniques to identify the
modes of a 200-nm-thick layered composite with per-
fectly conducting cladding layers – essentially represent-
ing a waveguide with deep subwavelength crossection.
This technique allows us to control the ﬁeld variation in
the direction perpendicular to the waveguide, and simul-
taneously enforce the “metamaterial condition” a1,2 ≪
λ = 1.55 µm for all nanolayered structures in our work.
We generated ∼ 100 ensembles of nanocomposites with
ǫ1 = −100 and ǫ2 ≃ 2 (Ag/SiO2 composite). In each en-
semble, we ﬁxed the total thickness of the composite,
total concentration of metal, and varied thickness of in-
dividual metal layers. The variation in layer thickness
was about 10% of average thickness. The idea behind
the ensemble generation is two-fold. First, we aim to un-
derstand the response of realistic multi-layered systems,
where the total number of layers is relatively small; sec-
ond, this approach gives us the opportunity to assess the
tolerance of the composite properties with respect to fab-
rication defects.

The proﬁles of several eigen modes are shown in Fig.2.
Note that the ﬁeld across an individual layer is expo-
nential rather than oscillatory in nature, so that high-

the quasi-static EMT results. Similar eﬀect have been
recently pointed out for microwave nanowire structures
in[17].

The excellent agreement between the non-local EMT
with results of numerical solutions of Maxwell equations
is shown in Fig.3.

To conclude, we have demonstrated that conventional
EMT fails to adequately describe the optical properties
of multi-layered metal-dielectric metamaterials. We iden-
tiﬁed strong variation of the ﬁeld, associated with cou-
pled surface plasmon polariton waves, to be the cause
of this disagreement and derived an analytical correc-
tion to incorporate non-local eﬀects into EMT. We have
also demonstrated that multi-layered structures support
high-index modes conﬁned to spatial areas as small as
λ/8. Our results, although illustrated here for TM
waves in two-component structures can be generalized
to TE waves and to multi-component systems involving
anisotropic materials using techniques presented in [14].

In this limit, the

The dispersion of the modes of this case can be related
to the eigen-values problem for two-layer transfer matrix,

An important note is that “real” parameter behind
the validity of eﬀective medium response is |k · a| ≪ 1.
In majority of all-dielectric nanostructures |ǫ1,2| ≃ 1,
and this parameter is identical to the commonly-used
criterion a ≪ λ, while for the metal-dielectric systems
the spatial dispersion provides a signiﬁcant correction to

Complex light: Dynamic phase transitions of a light beam in a nonlinear non-local
disordered medium

(Dated: February 21, 2014)

The dynamics of several light ﬁlaments (spatial optical solitons) propagating in a optically nonlin-
ear and non-local random medium is investigated using the paradigms of the physics of complexity.
Cluster formation is interpreted as a dynamic phase transition. A possible connection with the ran-
dom matrices approach for explaining the vibrational spectra of an ensemble of solitons is pointed
out. The results are also relevant for Bose condensed gases.

I.

INTRODUCTION

of soft, or complex, light.

At low temperature, the dynamics of complex media
is dominated by the potential energy landscape (PEL),
i.e. the multi-dimensional surface of the potential energy
as a function of the molecular coordinates. [1, 2, 3, 4] A
disordered system sampling diﬀerent PEL conﬁgurations
undergoes “dynamic phase transitions”, perhaps one of
the most spectacular ideas of the physics of complexity
[5, 6, 7, 8]. For the structural glassy transition, observed
in a certain class of (glass-forming) supercooled liquids,
this “conﬁgurational sampling” is at the origin of an in-
crease of viscosity of several orders of magnitudes, up
to values comparable to solids (for recent reviews see
for example [9, 10]). This phenomenon cannot be di-
rectly ascribed to a purely thermodynamic transition;
conversely, it is now widely accepted as a dynamic ef-
fect. During cooling, diﬀerent PEL regions are visited,
and the almost abrupt change of viscosity is associated
to the transition from “saddle-dominated” to “minima-
dominated” PEL basins. Since phonons are the elemen-
tary excitations around minima of the PEL, this process
is also denoted “phonon-saddle” transition, and can be
realized while keeping ﬁxed the temperature and acting
on some parameter, like the particle density or the inter-
action range. [11]

It is not diﬃcult to recognize the fundamental charac-
ter of these ideas, and the fact that they are not limited
to the speciﬁc contexts where they originally developed.
In this article I will show that a light beam propagat-
ing in disordered medium (i.e. a medium with negligible
optical losses whose refractive index is randomly vary-
ing) may undergo a sort of dynamic phase transition.
This happens when, due to an optically nonlinear re-
sponse, multiple ﬁlaments are generated. Their number
and properties depend on the mutual interaction range
and, in essence, they behaves like molecules in a complex
medium, exhibiting dynamic phases. The process can
described in terms of the appropriately deﬁned “inherent
structures” and “saddles”, in perfect analogy with the
physics of disordered materials. This qualiﬁes as a sort

Here the word “ﬁlament” (roughly) identiﬁes a spa-
tial soliton (SS), which is a non-diﬀracting light beam
generated in an optically nonlinear medium, with an in-
tensity dependent refractive index. [12, 13, 14] If a suﬃ-
ciently intense laser light propagates in such a material,
self-induced trapping counteracts the natural tendency
to diﬀract, and a tightly focused SS can be observed.
For example, in nematic liquid crystals (NLC), with laser
wavelength in the near infrared, it is possible to gener-
ate very thin (few micron waist) SSs, able to propagate
undistorted for millimeters: hundreds of times the dis-
tances attainable in absence of a nonlinear self-action.
[15, 16]

At each SS is associated an optically induced perturba-
tion ∆n to the refractive index, which is at the origin of
the self-focusing. If the incident beam is suﬃciently wide
many SSs are generated by the same input, as shown for
example in [17]. These ﬁlaments may propagate with var-
ious degrees of interaction, relying on the material prop-
erties and, in particular, on the so-called “non-locality”,
which can be kept in mind as the ratio between the spatial
extension of the refractive index perturbation induced by
one ﬁlament and its transverse intensity waist. In NLC,
the degree of nonlocality can be simply controlled by a
voltage bias,[18] and hence the dynamic phase transition
may be induced accordingly.[19]

The following results not only are well suited to de-
scribe light-soft-matter interaction experiments (as re-
ported in [18, 19]), but can be applied to interpret the
dynamics of ultrashort laser pulses propagating in air,
[20, 21] as well solitons in photorefractives,[22] media
[23, 24, 25]
with thermal nonlinearities and plasmas,
semiconductors [26], discrete solitons (see for example
[27] and references therein) and Bose-condensed gases
[28, 29].

This article is aimed to the introduction of the leading
idea, and to a phenomenological description, supported
by Brownian dynamics numerical simulations. In order
to simplify as much as possible the presentation no at-
tempt will be made to a theoretical analysis, which is
deferred to future publications. In section II the model
for the propagation of several light ﬁlaments in a ran-
dom medium is linked with Brownian dynamics. In sec-
tion III evidences of phase transitions from numerical

simulations are reported. Section IV is dedicated to the
deﬁnition and the analysis of the so-called inherent struc-
tures, and the corresponding order parameter. In section
V the generalized inherent structures are considered for
the deﬁnite settlement of the dynamic phase transition.
In section VI the phenomenon of critical slowing down is
addressed. In section VII a connection with the theory
of random matrices and the so-called dynamic structure
factor is established. Conclusions are drawn in section
VIII.

II. REDUCTION TO A BROWNIAN
DYNAMICS MODEL

For the sake of simplicity, the analysis is done with ref-
erence to one-dimensional (1+1D propagation) beams;
its generalization to higher dimensional problems is
straightforward. Consider the Fock-Leontovich equation,
which describes the paraxial optical propagation in a
nonlinear medium:

2ik

+

∂A
∂z

∂2A
∂x2 + 2k2 ∆n[I]

n

A = 0.

(1)

A(x, z) is the complex amplitude of the optical ﬁeld such
that I = |A(x, z)|2 is the intensity, k = 2πn/λ is the
wave-vector and n the refractive index at wavelength λ
in absence of non-linear eﬀects. ∆n is the optical in-
duced perturbation to n, its functional relation with I is
non-local: the speciﬁc distribution of ∆n(x, z) depends
on the whole proﬁle I(x, z). Various models are given
in the literatures relating ∆n and I, as the Kukhtarev
equations for photorefractives, (for a review, see Del Re
and coworkers in [12]) the heat equation for thermal non-
linearities, [23, 25] re-orientational equations for liquid
crystals, [30] or generic nonlocalities. [31, 32, 33]

For relatively low intensities ∆n is linear with I and,
in the presence of many incoherent ﬁlaments, it can be
written as the sum of the intensity distributions of the
ﬁlaments, with p = 1, 2, ..., N . The overall ∆n is thus the
sum of the index perturbations of each SS:

∆n[I] =

∆n[Ip].

(2)

N

Xp=1

Eq. (2) is valid whenever ∆n/n << 1, as typically veri-
ﬁed in the reported experiments, and when the ﬁlaments
are mutually incoherent, i.e. the relative phase between
pairs of them is randomly varying. The latter hypothe-
sis typically holds in soft-matter, by taking into account
that the SSs spontaneously generate from noisy intensity
perturbations, and propagate in a thermally ﬂuctuating
medium. Furthermore, in the presence of many ﬁlaments
the eﬀects of the relative phases and, more in general, of
the speciﬁc form of ∆n[I] can be negligible. This is anal-
ogous to the typical approach in statistical physics where,
quite often, the particular proﬁle of pair-interaction po-
tentials can be replaced by some simple model like the
Lennard-Jones potential. [34]

Following a perturbative analysis, the eﬀect of the in-
dex perturbation due to all SSs on the trajectory of
the generic ﬁlament p is considered. For N identical
stable solitons with intensity bell-shaped proﬁle IS(x),
∆nS(x) = ∆n[IS](x), and average position xp(z), using
the Ehrenfest’s theorem of standard quantum mechanics,
applied to the Schr¨odinger-like Eq. (1), one has for the

Here the analysis is specialized for the potential energy

The dynamics along the direction of propagation is hence
formally reduced to an ensemble of particles, evolving
with “time” z. The ﬂuctuations of the medium result into
a random contribution to ∆n that can be phenomenolog-
ically included in the model as a Langevin force ηp(z):

with S2
p the noise “power” and the brackets denotes a
statistical average over disorder. ηp(z) takes into account
the ﬂuctuations of the refractive index and deﬁnes a re-
alization of the random soft-medium.

Note that, in typical Langevin models, the random
term is accompanied by a dissipative term, which is
in general dependent on the lossy mechanisms in the
medium, like viscosity. In the limit of small losses and
small noise such term can be neglected, as it will be done
in the following in order to leave the treatment as general
and simple as possible. The good qualitative agreement
with reported experiments [19] supports this approach.
The explicit shapes of IS and ∆nS are due to the par-
ticular nonlinear mechanism; for the present purpose a
Gaussian ansatz for both of them is appropriate, since
non-local optically nonlinear media are being considered.

gives

with V0 = ∆n0I0[2πv2w2/(v2 +w2)]1/2 and u2 = v2 +w2.
V (x) is a Gaussian function within an arbitrary additive
constant. It is written as in (12) in order to have a van-
ishing Φ when all the solitons are in the same position
(“condensed phase”). u2 is the sum of the variances of IS
and ∆nS and provides a measure of the interaction range
between the SSs for a ﬁxed w, like u/w that will be used
in the following. Each ﬁlament increases the refractive
index (the medium is assumed to be focusing, ∆n0 > 0)
and the interaction is purely attractive, so that V0 > 0.
The previous formulation points the connections with
statistical physics, while reducing the model to a sys-
tem of interacting classical particles undergoing Brown-
ian motion, a typical model for colloids, where the for-
mation of clusters at the glass-transition is a well-known
process (see e.g. [37, 38, 39]).

3

Before proceeding it is however fruitful to point out a
subtle issue associated to Eqs. (9) and (12). It is well
expected that a ﬁnite number of classical particles, in-
teracting by a purely attractive potential, will oscillate
around the center of mass at equilibrium (i.e.
for long
times). This implies that only one energy minimum does
exist and corresponds to the condensed phase. At a ﬁrst
glance, no dynamic phase transition, due to local minima
of the PEL, is expected. Nevertheless, in the case under
consideration, it is clearly not possible to consider an
arbitrarily large propagation distance (corresponding to
long times). If losses are negligible and if the maximum
observation range (in z) is limited by the spatial exten-
sion of the sample, damping mechanisms can be neglected
and local PEL minima play a role. This opens the road
to the use of the concept of dynamic phase transition
in order to explain practical light-ﬁlamentation experi-
ments. It is also interesting to observe that this is very
similar to what happens to material glasses. Even if af-
ter the structural arrest (glassy transition) the temporal
dynamics of supercooled liquids is so long that cannot
be observed in the experiments, it is well known that re-
laxation processes are always present (“aging”). In other
words, for observing a glassy state it is necessary to ﬁx
the “observation window”. These issues, in the case of
complex light, will be deepened in future publications.

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

A typical distance between resolvable (by means of the
observation of light scattered from the sample) spatial
solitons, generated for example by modulational insta-
bility, can be taken as 6 times their waist w. Hence,
considering thin solitons with waist w = 5µm, taking
tens of ﬁlaments implies an input waist of the order of
the 500µm, which is comparable to those typically em-
ployed in experiments (see e.g. [16, 17]). In the following
two representative cases will be considered: N = 10 and
N = 30 (the principal dynamic phase transition, con-
sidered below, is obtained up to the largest considered
N = 100, not reported). In all the simulations the ﬁl-
aments are chosen uniformly distributed at z = 0, with
mutual distance 6w.

The noise “power” is measured by the corresponding

which is taken independent on p, for the sake of simplic-
ity: σ2

the simulations clearly relies on the speciﬁc material (in
particular, on the thermal coeﬃcient of the refractive in-
dex and on the sample temperature); however it is found
that the numerical results are very robust with respect
to noise, and very similar ﬁndings are obtained when σ
is varied by several order of magnitudes. Hence only the

case σ = 0.001 will be reported as a representative exam-
ple. The stochastic diﬀerential equations (9) are solved
by a second order scheme, as in Ref. 40.

As discussed above, a glassy transition is attained
while increasing the density, or equivalently the inter-
action length u/w.[11] Here, this corresponds to increase
the degree of nonlocality. In ﬁgure 1, some realizations of
the SSs trajectories, obtained by the numerical solution
of Eqs. (9) when N = 10, are shown for various u/w.
The adimensional time t = z/[w(V0/m)1/2] is used on
the horizontal axis.

For small u/w the ﬁlaments propagate in the presence
of a reduced interaction. Conversely, while increasing
u/w, various clusters are formed and their number and
positions vary with each realization of the noise. A sim-
ilar result is obtained in the case N = 30 (ﬁg. 2)

In ﬁgures 3 and 4, the “ﬁnal” (i.e. at a ﬁxed t =
tmax) position of each SS is shown Vs u/w, with the
results for 10 noise realizations superimposed. Clearly, in
certain ranges of the control parameter u/w the statistics
of the ﬁnal positions are highly peaked around 2 or 3
clusters, while they spread over a broad region in other
ranges. The appearance of an interval for u/w where
two dominant clusters are generated is evident. This is
referred to as the “principal dynamics phase transition”.
In the case N = 10 a phase with 3 clusters is also present
and it is somehow more noisy in the case for N = 30. For
a very large u/w the nonlocality is such that all the SSs
oscillate around an equilibrium position, this has been
above indicated as the condensed phase.

Similar results are obtained for an odd number of ﬁla-
ments (e.g. N = 21). In that case, in correspondence of
the principal dynamic phase transition, an additional SS
is found at the middle of the two clusters.

An open issue is the existence of fractal structures as

those investigated in [41].

kind of phase transition it is necessary to introduce an
“order parameter”, as outlined in the mentioned liter-
ature on the glassy transition. With this aim, I start
pointing out the inherent structure (IS) associated to
the numerical simulations. Once ﬁxed a maximum value
for the time tmax, the ﬁnal distribution of ﬁlaments is
used as guess for a conjugate gradient minimization pro-
cedure that ﬁnds the nearest minimum of the interac-
tion potential Φ. The corresponding vector of positions
(x1, x2, ..., xN ) is the IS. [2, 42] Its role is evident when
superimposing the plots of average ﬁnal positions for the
considered realizations (thick line in in Figs. 3 and 4)
and those of the average IS (thin white line in Figs. 3
and 4). Clearly, the latter provide information on the
number and the positions of the generated clusters.

According to the literature about complex media, [10]

Figures 3 and 4 also show the average ﬁlament posi-
tions Vs u/w, when N = 10 and N = 30 respectively.
The positions are determined at a very large t so that

In ﬁgures 5 and 6, eIS (in units of V0) is plotted Vs

at large u/w when all the solitons are in the same position
and corresponds to Φ = 0 (condensed phase); conversely
when the solitons are uniformly distributed (small u/w)
Φ is at maximum. Hence, while increasing u/w, Φ is
reduced, due to the coagulation mechanism. The data

in ﬁgures 5 and 6 show a decrease of eIS Vs u/w up to
the ﬁrst plateau, at the formation of two clusters. The
corresponding value of eIS/V0 is obtained after (8), by
observing that, when two clusters of N/2 SSs are formed
(for N even), Φ/V0 → N 2/4 as their mutual distance
goes to inﬁnity. The plateau for N = 10 corresponds to
eIS/V0 = 25, and to eIS/V0 = 225 for N = 30.

The trend is conserved for various numbers of ﬁla-
ments. The scale on the u/w axis changes with N (see
Figs. 5 and 6) because the degree of nonlocality needed
for the phase transition obviously increases with the num-
ber of ﬁlaments.

It is interesting to consider the “phase-diagram” eIS
Vs the reciprocal of u/w, as done in ﬁgure 7. It strongly
resembles the typical result obtained for ultra-cold liq-
uids, while plotting eIS Vs the temperature: at a speciﬁc
value of the control parameter a plateau is reached, and
eIS stays constant in the glassy phase. [10]

V. THE GENERALIZED INHERENT
STRUCTURES

For the deﬁnite settlement of the phonon-saddle tran-
sition, the so-called generalized inherent structure (GIS)
must also be taken into account. [6, 7, 43, 44] It is deﬁned
as the nearest stationary points of the PEL (where all the
forces are zero) to the ﬁnal conﬁguration. The latter is
used as a guess in a nonlinear solver (I used the c05pbf
NAG routine, Mark 19) for the N equations ∂Φ/∂xp = 0,
whose solution, given by a vector (x1, x2, ..., xN ) is just
the GIS. The saddle-order KGIS of the GIS is the num-
ber of the negative eigenvalues (imaginary frequencies)
of the Hessian of Φ, calculated at the GIS; if KGIS = 0
the GIS is a minimum.

For any realization of the system there is one IS and
one GIS. In a phonon-dominated phase the two structures
are the same and KGIS = 0. Conversely, in a saddle-
dominated phase KGIS > 0, but it tends approximately
to zero (on average on many realizations) in correspon-
dence of the dynamic phase-transition. [6, 7, 43, 44]

To understand the physical meaning of the GIS, con-
sider the principal dynamic phase transition. While the
IS corresponds to the ﬁlaments equally distributed be-
tween the two clusters, the GIS diﬀers for some of the SSs
positioned at intermediate places; it denotes the way the
system may escape from the energy minimum. Clearly,
if the noise-averaged KGIS is high the probability to ﬁnd
a direction in PEL to get out from the local minimum
of Φ is high: it somehow measures the number of escape
directions from the PEL minimum.

Actually, the average KGIS never reaches the zero as
discussed in [43], because this would correspond to a com-
plete freezing of the system, which is never the case for
a glassy transition.

Figure 8 shows the noise-averaged KGIS Vs u/w when
N = 10.
It clearly reveals a saddle-phonon transition
in proximity of u/w = 8; consistently with the phase-
diagram in ﬁgure 5. For larger values of u/w, the ad-
ditional dynamic phase transitions are not well deﬁned
(i.e. KGIS stays around one or two units) due to the
limited number of particles. This also clariﬁes the reason
for introducing a “principal” dynamic phase transition,
as done above. The latter, in the considered numerical
simulations, always corresponds to the formation of two
clusters. This is conﬁrmed in the case N = 30 (shown in
ﬁgure 9) where, due to an increased number of degrees
of freedom, the transition is more evident, and happens,
as before, when two clusters are generated.

VI. FLUCTUATIONS AND THE CRITICAL
SLOWING DOWN

The standard deviation ∆eIS of eIS, for the considered
noise realizations, has a particular importance for the
experimental evidences of the dynamic phase transition.
According to the numerical simulations, it has a universal
trend (with respect to number of ﬁlaments, their initial
distance and the amount of noise) which is shown in ﬁg-
ures 10 and 11. Moving towards a non-local region (i.e.
increasing the interaction range u/w) ∆eIS grows (in
the landscape dominated phase [10]) up to the dynamic
phase-transition, where small values are again achieved
(in the glassy phase). This quantity has the same trend
of the corresponding one investigated, for example, in
[45] in a Lennard-Jones material glass. Very similar re-
sults are obtained when simulating a larger number of
ﬁlaments, and for various values of the noise power.

A reduction of the noise in correspondence of the
glassy-phase is evident. To conﬁrm this eﬀect, I show
in ﬁgures 12 and 13, the relative maximum devia-
tion from the average position. This quantity, denoted

(∆x/hxi)max is calculated by taking the maximum de-
viation from the average (over the considered noise re-
alizations) position hxi for each ﬁlament (at t = tmax),
dividing by hxi and then averaging the resulting quantity
over all the N ﬁlaments. Clearly, it measures the noise
in the SS positions, and reproduces the same trend of
∆eIS. Before the phase transition all the SSs diﬀuse into
a wide region, while after the phase transition they are
locked inside each cluster.

VII. VIBRATIONAL SPECTRA AND THE
RANDOM MATRICES

In the experiments this phenomenon is resolved in
time. This means that, since the medium is ﬂuctuat-
ing, before the transition the number and the positions of
the clusters is rapidly varying. Conversely, when the two
clusters are formed, the intensity proﬁle “slows down”,
resembling the “critical slowing down” in glassy material
system. [9]

Once some analogy with a disordered medium has been
ascertained, a variety of issues spontaneously rises.
In
particular, those concerning the spectrum of the ﬂuctu-
ations and ultimately the propagation of “sound-waves”
(or better “displacement-waves”). These are associated
to the vibrational spectra of the ensemble of solitons.

The analysis of sound-waves is one of the most im-
portant issues in the physics of glassy systems (see for
example [46] and references therein). According to some
authors the appearance of ultra-high frequency sound can
be related to the vibrational spectrum of the material
and, in particular, and to an excess of states denoted “bo-
son peak” (see [11] and references therein). The trans-
position of these ideas to nonlinear optical propagation
is beyond the scope of this article. However, it interest-
ing to observe that one of the most successful theories
of structural glasses, the random-matrices approach, [47]
also seems well suited to describe the vibrational spectra
of the positions of a number of optical spatial solitons in
a disordered medium.

with V ′′ ≡ d2V /dx2. Due to noise (and eventually to
chaos), the considered conﬁguration has a certain statis-
tical distribution; the problem is hence reduced to ﬁnd
the corresponding statistical distribution of the eigenval-
ues of Hpq. Various approaches have been developed
and successfully applied to explain some material glass
features.
[47] Even if it is not straightforward to relate
these results to some observable quantity in the consid-
ered nonlinear optics experiments, what follows suggests
that the random matrices approach could be very fruitful
even in this ﬁeld of research.

Consider an experiment in which the position of each
SS can be retrieved by the scattered light from the top
of the sample (as those in the mentioned literature on
nematicons [15, 16]); the resulting images appear as a
number of superimposed light ﬁlaments, each with its
own few-microns waist, with overall intensity distribution
I(x, z). If a soliton proﬁle IS is associated to each SS, as
discussed above, I(x, z) can be interpreted as a coarse-
grained density of particles evolving along z. Roughly,
the squared modulus of the double-Fourier transform of
the image I(x, z), denoted S(kx, kz) (averaged over a
given number of noise realizations) could be interpreted
as the so-called “dynamic structure factor” [34] of the
soft-medium realized by the SSs, which play the role of
interacting Brownian molecules. S(kx, kz) gives the fre-
quency content in kz of the z-evolution of the spatial
“mode” at kx. In other words, once ﬁxed kx, S(kx, kz)
provides information on the dynamics of each intensity
perturbation with period 2π/kx.[48]

Consider, for example, the case in which all the soli-
tons travel approximately parallel, with a reduced inter-
action. In this case, if ∆x is the average mutual distance,
S(kx, kz) is expected to be approximately given by a se-
ries of peaks around kx = 2πm/∆x and kz = 0, with

sity proﬁle)when N = 10, u/w = 1 and tmax = 200, averaged
over 100 noise realizations.

m = 0, 1, 2, .... That is the kz-bandwidth of each “mode”
at kx is very small.

This happens, for example in the case N = 10, when
u/w = 1, as shown in the inset in ﬁgure 1. Taking the
corresponding numerical solution of eqs. (9), associating
to each trajectory a soliton proﬁle (a Gaussian proﬁle in
units such that w = 1), evaluating the squared modulus
of the Fourier transform of the resulting I(x, z), and ﬁ-
nally averaging over a given number of noise realizations,
Fig. 14 is obtained, which appears as anticipated.

The aim of the random matrices approach is to predict
the shape of S(kx, kz) with respect to some control pa-
rameter. In particular, under very general hypotheses, it
has been shown that, when the interaction range grows
(or equivalently the density of the particles is increased),
S(kx, kz) develops a Brillouin peak with position that is
linearly dependent on kx.[49] This corresponds to an X-
shape in the two dimensional level-plot of S(kx, kz). If
this approach is somehow applicable to the case of a few
light ﬁlaments, as considered here, repeating the analy-
sis of ﬁgure 14, for u/w at the dynamic phase transition,
should provide some evidence of the predicted X-shape.
This is exactly what happens, as shown in ﬁgure 15.

The formation of a Brillouin peak is obviously related
to the geometry of the ﬁlaments distribution. However,
it can be also associated to a movement of energy (or
equivalently of “mass”, which corresponds to the beam
power into each ﬁlament, as discussed above). Indeed,
when two clusters are formed and move far apart each
other, there is an evident energy transfer along x.
In
some sense the cluster movement is related to some wave-

9

ter. During nonlinear optical phenomena in disordered
media (or even in media in which the disorder is induced
by the input laser beam), the behavior of light can be in-
terpreted using the same paradigms of modern statistical
physics.

If a light ﬁlament, or spatial optical soliton, can be
treated as a classical particle, many interacting spatial
solitons correspond to a liquid or high density gas.
If
some noise is present in the system, a Brownian dynam-
ics model is readily introduced, and the ﬁlaments behave
like particles dispersed into a solvent, which is one of the
simplest deﬁnitions of soft-matter, and calls for the in-
troduction of “soft-light”. The dynamic phase transition
is the natural way to describe phenomenological trans-
formations, like the formation of clusters, as it has been
shown by numerical experiments in this article and ex-
perimentally in forecoming publications.

Nonlinear optics can be hence used to test, theoreti-
cally and experimentally, some of the ideas of the physics
of complexity, as well as the latter can be used to explain
many high-ﬁeld phenomena, like laser-ﬁlaments genera-
tion and interaction.

In this manuscript these ideas have been applied to

explain a possible manifestation of complex light.

during which the clusters are formed. However in the fol-

simplicity sake. I have checked that no substantial dif-

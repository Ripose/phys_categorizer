Abstract

Enhancement of optical Kerr nonlinearity for self-action by electro-magnetically induced trans-

parency in a four-level atomic system including dephasing between the ground states is studied in

detail by solving the density matrix equations for the atomic levels. We discern three major con-

tributions, from energy shifts of the ground states induced by the probe light, to the third-order

susceptibility in the four-level system.

In this four-level system with the frequency-degenerate

probes, quantum interference amongst the three contributions can, not only enhance the third-

order susceptibility more eﬀectively than in the three-level system with the same characteristic

parameters, but also make the ratio between its real and imaginary part controllable. Due to de-

phasing between the two ground states and constructive quantum interference, the most eﬀective

enhancement generally occurs at an oﬀset that is determined by the atomic transition frequency

diﬀerence and the coupling Rabi frequency.

INTRODUCTION

The weak nonlinear response of even the best materials has been a dominant limitation in

experimental research on quantum nonlinear optics for many years. A number of theoretical

proposals, including the creation of a two-photon bound state [1] and few-photon quantum

solitons [2], have not yet been experimentally realized due to the lack of large-Kerr-nonlinear

materials. However, recent research surrounding electro-magnetically induced transparency

(EIT) [3], which uses atomic coherence to reduce absorption, has opened up a completely

new route to achieving large optical nonlinearity [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. An EIT medium gener-

ally possesses two important features: vanishing resonant absorption and, simultaneously,

a refractive index curve with a very steep gradient [3]. These two features can signiﬁcantly

enhance the nonlinear interaction strength in multi-level atomic systems. In addition, the

latter can also signiﬁcantly reduce the group velocity of a probe light pulse and therefore

greatly increase the eﬀective interaction time of the pulse with the medium [7, 10]. These

features may therefore enable one to use an EIT medium to achieve nonlinear optical pro-

cesses at very low light intensities, or even at energies of a few photons per atomic cross

section [7, 8]. Recently, many EIT-enhanced nonlinear phenomena have been observed in

experiments, including the Kerr eﬀect[5, 11, 12, 13]. Of particular interest to the present

work, Wang et al. have measured the Kerr nonlinear coeﬃcient for self-phase modulation us-

ing a three-level system in Rubidium vapor and demonstrated that the nonlinear coeﬃcient

is indeed enhanced by EIT [14].

In addition to the scheme involving three atomic levels, a four-level system is also a

candidate for the enhancement of the Kerr nonlinearity for self-phase modulation [15]. It is

not clear at present which, the three-level system or the four-level system, provides the most

advantages for the enhancement of Kerr nonlinearity for self-action (self-phase modulation,

two-photon absorption) for very weak light. Or alternatively, because a four-level system in

some sense contains a three-level subsystem, how does the presence of the fourth level eﬀect

the enhancement of the nonlinearity? In addition, the four-level system considered in Ref.

[15] did not include the dephasing between the two ground states. How does the dephasing,

which is present in all realistic systems, alter the eﬀective enhancement of the nonlinearity?

In order to answer these two questions, in this paper we analyze a four-level system with

dephasing between the ground states. First, in section II we quantitatively compare a four-

2

level EIT scheme for self-action with the corresponding three-level scheme. We discern that

there are three major contributions, due to energy shifts of the ground states induced by

the probe ﬁeld, to the third-order susceptibility in the four-level system, and we ﬁnd that

quantum interference amongst the three contributions can, not only enhance the third-order

susceptibility more eﬀectively in the four-level system than in the three-level system, but

also make the ratio between its real and imaginary part controllable. Next, in section III we

analyze the detailed behavior of the most eﬀectively enhanced nonlinearity in the four-level

system. As a result we ﬁnd that in general, the most eﬀective enhancement does not occur

exactly at the center of the transparency window due to quantum interference and a ﬁnite

dephasing rate. On the contrary, it occurs at an oﬀset that is determined by the atomic

transition frequency diﬀerence and the coupling Rabi frequency.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL

We consider the interaction of two light ﬁelds, a coupling ﬁeld and a degenerate probe

ﬁeld, with a gas of atoms, as shown in Fig. 1. We assume the atoms can be described by

the four-level atomic scheme. Consider the case when most atoms are in the ground state

|1i, by applying a strong coupling light between the states |2i and |3i, we can dramatically

reduce the resonant absorption for the weak probe light on the transitions |1i ↔ |3i and

|2i ↔ |4i (see Fig. 1). Under the rotating wave approximation, this four-level system can be

described by the following density matrix equations in a frame rotating at frequency ωp[16]:

where ρij is the density matrix element, Ω13 = µ13Ep0/~ and Ω24 = µ24Ep0/~ are complex
Rabi frequencies for the probe light ﬁeld amplitude Ep0, and Ω23 = µ23Ec0/~ is the complex

Rabi frequency for the coupling light with electric ﬁeld amplitude Ec0, where µ13 and µ24

are electric dipole matrix elements. γ21 is the dephasing rate between the ground states |1i

and |2i (This was not included in Ref. [15]). The detuning angular frequencies are given by

∆13 = ωp −ω31, ∆23 = ωc −ω32, ∆24 = ωp −ω42, where ω31, ω32, ω42 are the atomic transition

frequencies. Additionally, we assume the probe light is very weak, and the coupling light is

on resonance (∆23 = 0). Under this assumption, there is a much larger probability of the

atoms being in the ground state |1i than in other states, i.e., ρ11 ≈ 1. Because the evolution

of the atoms is very fast and the light is normally approximated as a continuous wave, we can

consider the atoms to be in steady states. For simplicity of discussion, we assume uniform

decay rates and uniform electric dipole matrix elements, i.e., γ31 = γ32 = γ40 = γ42 = γ and

µ13 = µ24 = µ.

Due to the degeneracy of the probe frequency, the polarization induced by the probe ﬁeld

is a superposition of the two oﬀ-diagonal density matrix elements,

P = n(µ13ρ31 + µ24ρ42)e−iωpt + c.c.

(11)

4

where n is the atom density.

It is worth noting that this linear superposition gives rise

to quantum interference between the two oﬀ-diagonal density matrix elements, because

the two quantities are complex functions and there is coherence among the atomic states.

For example, if the transition amplitudes ρ31 and ρ42 are in phase, an eﬀective two-photon

transition will be enhanced; on the other hand, if the two amplitudes are out of phase, then a

photon emitted on one transition will be absorbed on the other and the eﬀective two-photon

transition will be suppressed.

It is evident that there is no interference between the two

oﬀ-diagonal density matrix elements in the four-level system with frequency-non-degenerate

probes [6]. Thus this superposition of the two oﬀ-diagonal density matrix elements is a

unique feature of the four-level system with one frequency-degenerate probe. Because the

probe ﬁeld is monochromatic, the corresponding susceptibility has the simple form,

ε0 (cid:0)χ(1)(Ec0)Ep0 + χ(N L)(Ec0, Ep0)E3

p0(cid:1) = 2n(µ13ρ31 + µ24ρ42)

(12)

where χ(1) is the linear susceptibility and χ(N L) the nonlinear susceptibility. When Ep0 → 0,
χ(N L) corresponds to the third-order susceptibility χ(3). The real part of χ(3) is proportional

to the Kerr refractive index and the imaginary part of χ(3) to the two-photon absorption

coeﬃcient. Here, χ(2) does not exist because of the symmetry of the atomic medium. Al-

though the occupation probabilities of atoms on both the states |2i and |4i are very small,

the contribution of ρ42 to the third-order susceptibility is not small, as we will see in next

section, therefore neglecting the contribution of ρ42 to the third-order susceptibility is in-

correct [15]. To analyze the enhanced optical nonlinearity of the EIT medium, we use a

numerical method, Gaussian elimination, to solve Eqs. (2)-(10) in the steady state and then

extract the ﬁrst-order and the third-order susceptibilities via the relation (12).

III. NUMERICAL COMPARISON OF FOUR-LEVEL AND THREE-LEVEL SYS-

TEMS

In this section, we numerically compare a four-level EIT system with a three-level EIT

system. The three-level system we consider is in fact a special case of the present four-

level one. When the atomic transition frequency diﬀerence ω31 − ω42 is very large, if the

probe frequency ωp is close to the atomic transition frequency ω31, it will be far detuned

from the other atomic transition frequency ω42. In this case, any eﬀect from the state |4i is

5

negligible, and the four-level system can be approximated as a three-level system with similar

parameters. As the three-level system is actually a subsystem of the four-level system, the

comparison with the three-level system is not only to show the advantage of the four-level

system in enhancing Kerr nonlinearity, but also to show the contribution of the three-level

subsystem, i.e., the states |1i, |2i and |3i, to the third-order susceptibility in the four-level

system.

We do the comparison ﬁrst in terms of third-order susceptibility χ(3), and then in terms

of the ratio between the third-order susceptibility and the ﬁrst-order susceptibility, i.e.,

χ(3)/Imχ(1). In the ﬁrst comparison, we show that there are three major contributions of light

shifts of the ground states to χ(3) in the four-level system: one of them is actually produced

within the three-level subsystem, and other two are speciﬁc to the four-level system.

In

particular, we show that there is quantum interference, which does not exist in the four-

level system with frequency-non-degenerate probes [6], amongst the three contributions due

to atomic coherence. As a result, one can achieve not only larger third-order susceptibility in

the four-level system than in the three-level system, but also a control of the ratio between

its real and imaginary part. Then in the ﬁnal part of the section, we consider the ﬁnite

dephasing rate between the ground states, and further show the advantage of the four-

level system in eﬀectively enhancing the third-order nonlinear susceptibility with this new

criterion.

A. Analysis in terms of χ(3)

First, following the idea described in the beginning of this section, we let ω31 − ω42 =

−105γ and the four-level system becomes eﬀectively a three-level system. Any contribution

of the state |4i to the susceptibility is negligible, so the third-order susceptibility χ(3), as

shown by the dashed lines in Fig. 2 (a) and (b), only originates from the three states |1i,

|2i and |3i, through the oﬀ-diagonal density matrix element ρ31. Its real part has already

been demonstrated to be much larger than that of the resonantly enhanced susceptibility

without the coupling ﬁeld at a ﬁnite detuning [14]. Here we can understand the unusually

large magnitude of Reχ(3) in a similar way to Ref. [8]: the presence of the weak probe ﬁeld

between the states |1i and |3i causes an energy shift of the state |2i, which results in an

eﬀective shift of the linear susceptibility χ(1) curve (see Fig. 2 (c)). However, here there is

6

an important diﬀerence from Ref.

[8]: these shifts of the curves are not horizontal shifts

along the frequency axis, but changes of the gradients of the curves. For Reχ(1), the gradient

variation is equivalent to a small rotation of the solid curve around the zero detuning. Then

we can understand that although Reχ(3) in the situation of EIT is much larger than the

resonantly enhanced Reχ(3) without the coupling ﬁeld at a ﬁnite detuning, the magnitudes

of Reχ(3) and Imχ(3) also become zero at the zero detuning, as shown in Fig. 2 (a) and

(b). Thus the light shift within the three-level subsystem produces a contribution to the

third-order susceptibility in the four-level system, and the contribution becomes important

when the probe detuning is ﬁnite.

Next, let us consider the solo contribution of ρ31 to χ(3) at a small atomic transition

frequency diﬀerence ω31 − ω42 plotted by the thin solid lines and the thin dot-dashed lines

in Fig. 2 (a) and (b). We can ﬁnd that although both the thin solid curves and the thin

dot-dashed curves keep some resemblance of the dashed curves of the three-level system, the

magnitudes of some parts of the curves are signiﬁcantly larger than those of the three-level

system at the same frequency. These variations indicate that the presence of the state |4i has

important inﬂuence on χ(3) through ρ31. We can understand this eﬀect in the same way as

Ref. [6, 8]: the presence of the weak probe ﬁeld between the states |2i and |4i leads to another

energy shift of the state |2i, which results in another eﬀective shift of the linear susceptibility

χ(1), i.e., the curves experience additional shifts besides the gradient shifts produced within

the three-level subsystem. For the real part of the susceptibility, the shift is mainly along

the frequency axis when the atomic transition frequency diﬀerence ω31 − ω42 6= 0. Thus the

shift results in a ﬁnite value of Reχ(3) at the center of the transparency window.

Next, following Eq. (12), we include the contribution of ρ42 in the calculation of χ(3),

as shown by the thick solid curves and thick dot-dashed curves in Fig. 2 (a) and (b). In

comparison with the corresponding thin solid curves and thin dot-dashed curves, we can

ﬁnd that both Reχ(3) and Imχ(3) are drastically changed once again. In particular, Imχ(3)

is twice its previous value at zero detuning when ω31 = ω42, as shown by the two solid lines
in Fig. 2 (b). This indicates that the contribution of ρ42 to χ(3) is not small, and neglecting
its contribution as in Ref. [15] does not give us correct values of χ(3). We can see that the

shift results in another increase of the magnitude of Reχ(3) at the center of the transparency

window when the atomic transition frequency diﬀerence ω31 − ω42 6= 0. Similarly, the energy

shift of the state |2i due to the interaction of the weak probe ﬁeld with the states |1i and

7

|3i leads to another eﬀective shift of χ(1) through ρ42.

So far we have found three major contributions of light shifts to the third-order suscep-

tibility in the four-level EIT system. However, the most important feature is that there

is quantum interference amongst the three contributions because of the existence of the

atomic coherence among the atomic levels. The linear superposition of ρ31 and ρ42 in Eq.

(12) shows explicitly that the interference can occur. Through comparison of the curves of

χ(3) for diﬀerent contributions in Fig. 2 (a) and (b), we can also discern the variation of the

susceptibility due to the interference: the magnitude of χ(3) may be much increased at cer-

tain detuning due to constructive interference, but much reduced at another detuning due to

destructive interference. For example, for ∆13 ≈ 0.25γ, the magnitude of Reχ(3), plotted by

the thick dot-dashed curve in Fig. 2 (a), is increased in comparison with the thin dot-dashed

curve and the dashed curve at the same frequency due to constructive interference; however,

the magnitude of Imχ(3) vanishes at the same detuning due to destructive interference, as

shown in Fig. 2 (b). In the four-level system with frequency-non-degenerate probes, there

is no such quantum interference eﬀect [6]. This quantum interference process is a unique

feature of the four-level system with degenerate probes that we study in this paper. By

using this quantum interference we can, not only enhance χ(3) in the four-level system more

than that in the three-level system, but also control the ratio between Reχ(3) and Imχ(3),

as shown in Fig. 3. Comparing the thin curves and the corresponding thick curves, we ﬁnd

that a small probe detuning can produce some zero points for Imχ(3) and change the ratio

dramatically. If, for example, the four levels are magnetic sub-levels in experiments, one

can use a magnetic ﬁeld to control the atomic transition frequency diﬀerence ω31 − ω42 and

simultaneously set the probe detuning ∆31 to achieve expected ratios. Undoubtedly, such

control of the nonlinear susceptibility will be very useful in a practical design of various

optical devices.

B. Analysis in terms of χ(3)/Imχ(1)

Because the magnitude of a nonlinear eﬀect per unit length becomes very small at very low

light intensities, such as when there are few photons per atomic cross section, propagating

light beams for a long distance in a nonlinear medium is usually a good way to magnify

the nonlinear eﬀect. However, the distance that light beams can propagate is limited by

8

the linear absorption of the medium, which cannot be zero even under the conditions of

EIT because normally γ21 is not zero. Thus, the ratio between the nonlinear coeﬃcient

and the linear absorption of the medium is the real criterion for the eﬀectiveness of the

enhancement of the nonlinear coeﬃcient. We therefore calculate the ratio between the

third-order susceptibility χ(3) and the imaginary part of the ﬁrst-order susceptibility χ(1):

λ = χ(3)/Imχ(1)

(13)

The results for the four-level system and the three-level system are shown in Figs. 4(a),

(b), (c), and (d).

In order to determine the positions of the peaks of λ relative to the

transparency window, we also depict Imχ(1) in Fig. 4(e).

We ﬁnd that for the four-level system with a small atomic transition frequency diﬀerence

ω31 − ω42 = −γ, the position of the largest peak (along the detuning axis) of Reλ (or Imλ)

is always close to the center of the transparency window independent of the value of the

Rabi frequency Ω23, as shown in Figs. 4(a) and (b). In contrast, the three-level system can

only produce very small peaks (along the detuning axis) of Reλ at the central part of the

transparency window, as shown in Figs. 4(c) and (d). The largest peaks (along the detuning

axis) of Reλ (or −Imλ) of the three-level system are not in the central region but very close

to the two edges of the transparency window, and move away from the center when the

transparency window becomes wider, as indicated by the arrows in Figs. 4(c) and (d) —

Wang et al. have already demonstrated this phenomenon in their recent experiments [17].

Because the magnitude of Imχ(1) at the edges is much larger than at the center [see Fig.

4 (e)], the magnitudes of the largest peaks of λ of the three-level system are much smaller

than those of the central peaks of λ of the four-level system as seen in Figs. 4(a) and (b). In

this calculation, we assume the dephasing rate γ21 = 0.01γ. In this case the largest peak for

the three-level system is more than one order smaller than the largest peak for the four-level

system.

From the above comparison in terms of λ, we further conﬁrm that the third-order sus-

ceptibility χ(3) is indeed more eﬀectively enhanced in the four-level system, and therefore

the four-level system has an advantage for the realization of many quantum nonlinear optics

phenomena. However, this conclusion does not mean the contribution of the three-level

subsystem to the eﬀectively enhanced λ is negligible. In the next section, we will show the

important inﬂuence of the quantum interference amongst the three contributions of light

9

shifts to χ(3) on the largest peak of λ at a ﬁnite probe detuning when the transparency

window becomes wider.

IV. BEHAVIOR OF THE LARGEST PEAK OF λ OF THE FOUR-LEVEL SYS-

In this section, we consider the detailed behavior of the largest peak of λ of the four-level

system with a small atomic transition frequency diﬀerence ω31 − ω42 and a ﬁnite value of the

dephasing rate γ21. Because the dephasing rate γ21 is always ﬁnite in reality [10, 11], the
absorption described by Imχ(1) is not zero when ∆13 = 0γ, and λ is not divergent at this

detuning. Thus, it is important in an implementation of the four-level scheme to determine

under what condition the most eﬀectively enhanced nonlinear susceptibility occurs under a

ﬁnite dephasing rate γ21. In Fig. 4 (b), we can easily discern that the value of the largest

peak (along the detuning axis) of Imλ increases when the coupling Rabi frequency Ω23

increases. By checking more carefully, we ﬁnd that not only the value of the peak of λ but

also the position of the peak depends on the coupling Rabi frequency. This is depicted in

Fig. 5.

Fig. 5(a) shows the dependence of the value of the largest peak (along the detuning axis)

of Imλ, i.e., (Imλ)peak, on the Rabi frequency, Ω23, and the atomic transition frequency

diﬀerence ω31 − ω42. In this calculation, we assume the dephasing rate γ21 = 0.01γ. We

ﬁnd that as the coupling Rabi frequency, Ω23, increases, (Imλ)peak (for a ﬁxed value of

ω31 − ω42) has a relatively small value at ﬁrst, increases very rapidly, and then saturates to

a relatively large value. For a ﬁxed small value of Ω23/γ, (Imλ)peak decreases monotonically

as (ω31 − ω42)/γ decreases from 0 to −3. However, the saturation values for diﬀerent values

of ω31 − ω42 always appear to be the same, and they are always larger than (Imλ)peak at

small Ω23/γ. Although the value of the largest peak of Reλ, (Reλ)peak, is not a monotonic

function of (ω31 − ω42)/γ at small Ω23/γ, its behavior is quite similar to that of (Imλ)peak:

as the coupling Rabi frequency Ω23 increases, (Reλ)peak always saturates at the same value,

which is larger than its value at small Ω23/γ in most cases, as shown in Fig. 5(c). The

behavior of the largest peaks of Reλ and Imλ indicate that if the most eﬀectively enhanced

nonlinear susceptibility is desired under a ﬁnite γ21, then the coupling Rabi frequency Ω23

should be set as large as possible. This is especially true when the magnitude of the atomic

10

transition frequency diﬀerence is not small.

Next, from Fig. 5(b) [or (d)], we ﬁnd that for a ﬁxed value of (ω31 − ω42)/γ, when

(Imλ)peak (or (Reλ)peak) increases and saturates, the detuning (∆13)peak, at which the largest

peak occurs, also shifts asymptotically from (∆13)peak = 0 to another ﬁnite value. The

asymptotic value of the detuning is always equal to −(ω31 − ω42)/2, as shown in Fig. 5(b).

This value exactly corresponds to the frequency of the probe light being resonant with the

two-photon transitions between states |1i ↔ |4i, i.e., 2ωp = ω31 + ω42. The asymptotic value

of the detuning at which the largest peak of Reλ occurs is always a half line width, γ/2, away

from that of the largest peak of Imλ for the same (ω31 − ω42)/γ, as shown in Fig. 5(d). This

behavior of the largest peaks of Reλ and Imλ indicates that while the transparency window

becomes wider, the constructive quantum interference amongst the three contributions of

light shifts becomes more important, and the peak of λ therefore shifts to a nonzero probe

detuning. Thus if a most eﬀectively enhanced nonlinear susceptibility is desired under a

ﬁnite γ21, the detuning of the probe light should be set close to the asymptotic values found

in the above analysis. This is especially true when the magnitude of the atomic transition

frequency diﬀerence is not very small. Even if a certain ratio between Reχ(3) and Imχ(3) is

required, the asymptotic values shown above will be important for determining the optimum

detuning setting. Setting the detuning to zero, i.e., the center of the transparency window,

might not be the best choice.

Additionally, an interesting case occurs when ω31 − ω42 = −γ (or 0γ).

In this case,

(Reλ)peak (or (Imλ)peak) reaches its saturation value for very small values of Ω23. This

means that the enhancement of the nonlinear susceptibility can occur at very low coupling

light intensity.

In the calculations in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, we assumed the dephasing rate of the ground

states is γ21 = 0.01γ. More generally, we can calculate the dependence of the saturation

values of the largest peaks of λ on the dephasing rate γ21, as shown in Fig. 6. If the dephasing

rate γ21 is much smaller than the decay rate γ of the upper levels, then the four-level system

can enhance the nonlinear susceptibility more eﬀectively, as indicated by λ. This means

that in order to employ the four-level system to more eﬀectively enhance the nonlinearity,

one needs to reduce the dephasing rate of the ground states as much as possible.

The analysis of the behavior of the largest peak of λ also demonstrates the importance

of the quantum interference amongst the three contributions of light shifts to χ(3) when the

11

transparency window is very wide. To implement the four-level system with a ﬁnite γ21

to more eﬀectively enhance the nonlinear susceptibility, the coupling Rabi frequency Ω23

should be set as large as possible and simultaneously the detuning of the probe light should

be set as close as possible to the asymptotic values found in the above analysis. This is

particularly important when the magnitude of the atomic transition frequency diﬀerence is

not so small. This conclusion is very diﬀerent from the proposal in Ref. [15] due to the fact

that in that work only the very special case when the dephasing rate vanishes, γ21 = 0, was

considered.

V. CONCLUSION

We have studied in detail the third-order susceptibility for self-action of a four-level sys-

tem, including the dephasing between the two ground states, under the condition of EIT

by numerically solving the steady-state equations for the atomic density matrix. Through

comparison of the four-level system with a three-level system with the same characteristic pa-

rameters, we discerned three major contributions from light shifts to the third-order suscep-

tibility in the four-level system. In particular, we found that quantum interference amongst

the three contributions, which does not exist in the four-level system with frequency-non-

degenerate probes [6], can not only enhance the third-order susceptibility more eﬀectively

in the four-level system than in the three-level system, but also make the ratio between its

real part and imaginary part controllable. This unique feature means the four-level system

has certain advantages for the realization of many quantum nonlinear optics phenomena. In

implementing this scheme, it is important to note that in general the most eﬀective enhance-

ment of the nonlinear susceptibility does not occur exactly at the center of the transparency

window. Instead, due to the constructive quantum interference, and a ﬁnite dephasing rate

between the two ground states, the most eﬀective enhancement occurs at an oﬀset that is

determined by the atomic transition frequency diﬀerence and the coupling Rabi frequency.

FIG. 2: Probe susceptibilities vs the probe detuning frequency. (a) and (b) show the real and

imaginary parts of the third-order susceptibility χ(3) for the four-level system in three cases: ω31 −

ω42 = −105γ (dashed lines, an approximation to a three level system), ω31 = ω42 (thick solid lines)
and ω31 − ω42 = 2γ (thick dot-dashed lines). χ(3) is in units of 2nµ4/(ε0~3γ3). In addition, they

also show the solo contribution of ρ31 to χ(3) in the second case (thin solid lines) and the third

case (thin dot-dashed lines). (c) shows the transparency window: the real part (solid line) and

imaginary part (dashed line) of the ﬁrst-order susceptibility χ(1) both become zero at ∆13 = 0γ.
χ(1) is in units of 2nµ2/(ε0~γ). In the calculation, γ21 = 0γ and Ω23 = 2γ.

FIG. 3: The third-order susceptibility χ(3) vs the atomic transition frequency diﬀerence ω31 − ω42

in the four-level system for two kinds of probe detunings ∆13. The real and imaginary parts of
χ(3) in units of 2nµ4/(ε0~3γ3) are represented by the solid line and the dashed line, respectively.

The inset shows the ratio between the real part and the imaginary part of χ(3) as a function of

ω31 − ω42. In the calculation, ∆24 = ω31 − ω42, Ω23 = 2γ and ∆13 = 0γ (thin lines) or 0.4γ (thick

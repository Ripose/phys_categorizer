Abstract

In this article we review recent theoretical and experimental devel-
opments on multilongitudinal–mode emission in ring cavity lasers, pay-
ing special attention to class B lasers. We consider both homogeneously
and inhomogeneously broadened amplifying media as well as the limits of
small and large cavity losses (i.e., we treat cases within and outside the
uniform ﬁeld limit approximation). In particular we discuss up to what ex-
tent the experimental observations of self–mode locking in erbium–doped
ﬁber lasers carried out in recent years are a manifestation of the Risken-
Nummedal–Graham-Haken instability.

1 INTRODUCTION:

WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT LASER
INSTABILITIES?

The very ﬁrst laser – Maiman’s ruby in 1961 – produced extremely unstable
emission, as evidenced by a ﬁgure in the original publication [1]. Soon there-
after, researchers began to learn the skills of how to avoid instabilities in lasers
designed for applications. Nonetheless laser instabilities have been around ever
since both as a nuisance lurking to haunt technically-minded people, and as an

1

interesting nontrivial physical phenomenon for the more fundamental-principles-
minded set. After all, lasers are nonlinear dynamical feedback systems, and
instabilities are inherent in such systems. It is certainly warranted to gain an
understanding of laser instabilities – if only for the minimalist purpose that
they be avoided successfully in spite of the ever increasing demands on lasers in
terms of power, speed, tunability, etc.

In lasers, typically one or several modes of the light ﬁeld are subject to res-
onator boundary conditions while at the same time being dynamically coupled
to the amplifying medium. Typically the coupling is highly nonlinear, and de-
pending on the laser type and particular circumstances, the laser may behave
in many diﬀerent ways, running the gamut from smooth and stable single-mode
to irregular and unpredictable chaotic operation.

To systematically address the plethora of possibilities, one can make a ﬁrst
distinction between cases in which either several transverse modes are involved,
or just a single one (TEM00). Next-neighbor longitudinal modes always have
very nearly the same frequency diﬀerence, and only a single beat frequency,
along with its overtones, can occur. In contrast, for transverse modes there can
be more beat frequencies, giving rise to an enormous wealth of possibilities for
frequency locking and pulling phenomena. Maiman’s ruby laser, for example,
displayed an instability that involved several transverse modes. The complexity
of the situation is not helped by the fact that a mathematical description requires
either an inﬁnite set of ordinary diﬀerential equations, or a set of fully space-
dependent partial diﬀerential equations. Nonetheless, quite some research was
devoted to multi-transverse mode dynamics (see [2, 3, 4] for references, and the
rest of articles appearing in the present volume). More attention, however, was
given to single mode laser instabilities over the last three decades. Overviews
and references can be found, e.g., in [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

Here we shall consider single–transverse mode problems.

In this context,
there is an important distinction whether several longitudinal cavity modes are
involved in the lasing process, or just a single one, although a connection between
singlemode and multimode instabilities can be established [14].
It is also of
fundamental importance whether the gain medium exhibits a homogeneously or
inhomogeneously broadened lasing transition (see, e.g., [2, 9]).

It was noticed by Haken in 1975 [15] that the Maxwell-Bloch model for a
homogeneously broadened single mode laser is isomorphic to the Lorenz model
of chaos, originally developed for climatic instability [16]. This directly implies
that these lasers must exhibit a second threshold, i.e. a characteristic value of
the pump power above which a Lorenz-type instability sets on. One can show
that this second threshold is at least nine times higher than the ﬁrst (ordinary)
threshold above which there is coherent oscillation (see, e.g., [2, 9, 10, 15, 16]).
This “factor–of–nine”is of great importance to the present paper. Later Weiss
found [17] that certain far-infrared lasers have suitable damping rates and can
be pumped hard enough to test this prediction. Indeed they displayed chaotic
behavior remarkably similar in many respects to that exhibited by the Lorenz
model [18, 19]. Unfortunately the level structure of the gain atoms was much
more complex than a two-level system. The relevance of this diﬀerence for

2

the laser dynamics was the focus of some controversy during the eighties and
the beginning of the nineties (see [20, 21] for a discussion at depth and for
references). However, in the absence of a formal proof of equivalence between
the realistic laser model and the Lorenz model, one can only cautiously conclude
that some lasers can display Lorenz chaos even when their structure does not
make it obvious that the Lorenz equations are the appropriate model.

In contrast, multilongitudinal mode laser emission has received only marginal
attention from the viewpoint of laser instabilities. This is all the more remark-
able considering that most lasers emit in several longitudinal modes, if only due
to spectral hole burning in inhomogeneously broadened active media (see, e.g.,
[22, 23, 24]).

It is a common belief that with a homogenously broadened gain line and
single-transverse mode condition, the only way to have more than one longi-
tudinal mode oscillating is spatial inhomogeneity in the medium, such as the
spatial hole burning occurring in linear resonators. The spatial inhomogeneity
provides the required amount of independence of the inversion available to one
mode from that available to another mode so that the usual winner-takes-all
coupling is suspended in favor of the mild mutual coupling due the ﬁnite overall
energy balance1.

This myth was shattered when in 1968 two publications, independent of
each other, discussed the situation in detail [29, 30] (see also [31]).
It was
shown that even in a unidirectional resonator ﬁlled with a perfectly homogeneous
medium, Rabi splitting of the lasing transition induced by the lasing mode can
provide gain for other longitudinal modes. This means that even perfect gain
homogeneity does not safeguard against instability. While a string of four names
makes a somewhat awkward moniker, fairness dictates to call this mechanism
the Risken-Nummedal-Graham-Haken Instability, or RNGHI for short. Ikeda et
al. introduced the term Resonant Rabi Instability for designating this instability
[32] 2.

In [29, 30, 31] a unidirectional ring cavity with small cavity losses ﬁlled
with a homogeneously broadened two–level active medium was assumed. The
prediction was that for RNGHI to occur the pump power must exceed a certain
instability threshold. This instability threshold is referred to as the second
threshold, in distinction to the familiar ﬁrst threshold which deﬁnes the onset
of coherent laser oscillation. The value of the second threshold came out to be
1A good deal of theoretical and experimental work has been done in order to correctly
understand multimode emission in Fabry–Perot cavity lasers, starting with the well known
Tang–Statz–de Mars model [25]. We refer the interested reader to [12, 26, 27, 28] and references
therein. That subject, while very interesting in itself, is beyond the scope of the present
discussion.

2Interestingly, in 1976 Graham [33] showed that the multimode laser model, the RNGH
model, is isomorphous to the Lorenz model [16], thus extending the analogy discovered by
Haken the previous year [15]. The diﬀerence between the singlemode and the multimode case
is that in the latter the parameter σ is not ﬁxed as it depends on the velocity of the travelling–
wave solution. This would be extended further to cover detuning in 1990 when Ning and Haken
[34] showed that the detuned multimode laser equations are isomorphic to the complex Lorenz
model for the baroclinic instability [35]. This isomorphism is a powerful tool that has not
been investigated enough, specially for what concerns the multimode instability.

at least nine times the lasing threshold (the same “factor–of–nine”as in single–
mode instabilities in the Lorenz–Haken model). Another condition was that
the laser cavity length must exceed a certain minimum. Indeed, it has to be
unrealistically long for conventional bulk lasers [2, 9].

Due to these predictions and without experimental demonstration of the
opposite, interest in RNGHI abated over time: While during the Seventies and
Eighties much theoretical eﬀort was devoted to the understanding of the RNGHI
as well as to the dynamics of the laser above the second threshold [36, 37, 38,
39, 40, 41, 42, 43], eventually RNGHI was more or less dismissed as a merely
academical prediction rather than an actual mechanism for multimode emission.
In 1984 researchers announced that they had observed what could be inter-
preted as RNGHI in a dye laser [44, 45]. The dye laser seemed to be a good
candidate for the observation of the RNGHI as (i) it is a homogeneously broad-
ened laser, and (ii) the “critical”cavity length (see later for a precise deﬁnition
of this term) is smaller than typical resonator lengths [2]. However, it was pecu-
liar that in the spectrum there where only two peaks instead of three. Finally,
after some debate [46], Fu and Haken showed that a suitable model for the dye
(consisting of bands rather than levels) could explain the observations without
invoking the RNGHI [47, 48, 49]. From then on the observation in [44, 45] was
no longer considered as a manifestation of the RNGHI.

A few years later, a phenomenon very similar to RNGHI was discussed in
the context of optical bistability performed in the microwave regime [50, 51].
The experimental system consisted of a waveguide Fabry–Perot cavity with a
length of 182 m ﬁlled with hydrocyanic acid vapor at low (
1 mTorr) pressure.
Driven at a frequency of 86 GHz near a HC15N transition, this system displayed
bistability and, on the upper branch of the bistable loop, self-oscillation at a
frequency of the order of the cavity free spectral range and of the Rabi frequency,
but could deviate by 50% or so. Nevertheless it is to be emphasized that this
fairly unique experiment actually displayed not the RNGHI, but the multimode
instability of optical bistability predicted in 1978 by Bonifacio and Lugiato [52].
Thus, for many years and after a false start, the closest thing to the RNGH laser
instability that was actually observed was Rabi splitting in microwave optical
bistability – not very close, certainly.

≈

The discussion on the RNGHI during the late Eighties and the Nineties
faded, although theoretical studies continued [32, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60,
61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68], and signatures of the RNGHI were predicted also
for laser related systems such as a laser with an intracavity parametric ampliﬁer
[69], and a laser with injected signal [70]. Nonetheless, in this period it seemed
like the matter of longitudinal mode instabilities in lasers, and the RNGHI in
particular, would soon be more or less forgotten.

The situation changed with a suggestion by Lugiato and coworkers [71, 72].
They observed that a ring–cavity erbium–doped ﬁbre laser (EDFL) sponta-
neously mode-locked and emitted a train of pulses with a repetition time equal
to the cavity roundtrip time. This is one signature of the RNGHI, but certainly
not in itself a suﬃcient criterion. However, the unusually long cavity length
of ﬁbre lasers automatically fulﬁls the most diﬃcult prerequisite for RNGHI of

4

suﬃcient resonator length. On this basis they put forward the hypothesis that
self–pulsing in these lasers could be a manifestation of the RNGHI (see also [73]
for compatible experimental results).

Unfortunately they could not conﬁrm the existence of a second laser thresh-
old, i.e. a threshold-like onset of the instability. Moreover, there was a grave
quantitative diﬃculty: Instabilities were observed at pump powers immediately
above the lasing threshold [72], in stark contrast to the prediction that the
second threshold be at least nine times higher than the ﬁrst.

It was subsequently shown that this requirement is not necessarily applicable
to real-world lasers.
In [74] the usual two-level atom model for Lorenz-type
instability was extended to incorporate a third level as a necessity for applying
a pump source. It turned out that the instability threshold was lowered such
as to come close to the lasing threshold. This ﬁnding was then applied to
EDFLs [75]. Erbium ions, too, behave more like three–level systems [76], rather
than two–level systems as the original theory assumed. Now the ratio of the
instability to the laser threshold was predicted to be close to unity. This was
subsequently corroborated (and expanded to include four-level cases) in [77].

Put simply, for EDFLs the expected “factor–of–nine”, became a “factor–
of–(1 + ǫ)”. Thereby, the apparent contradiction with the hypothesis in [72] is
gone. This insight bestowed fresh vigor on the debate on RNGHI and lead to
dedicated experimental investigation as will be described below.

In this paper we shall review the fundamentals of the RNGH theory as
well as the research we have carried out along the recent years (including some
inedit results), i.e., we shall not review in detail the available literature. After
this historical introduction, the paper follows with three more sections. Sect. 2
is devoted to the RNGHI in homogeneously broadened media. In this section
we ﬁrst explain in detail modelling issues, Sect. 2.1, and then we treat the
RNGHI, ﬁrst in the uniform ﬁeld limit (Sect. 2.2) and then outside the limit
of validity of this standard approximation (Sect. 2.3). In Sect. 3 we consider
multilongitudinal mode emission in inhomogeneously broadened media, again
within (Sect. 3.2) and outside (Sect. 3.3) the uniform ﬁeld limit. Then in
Sect. 4 we discuss the experimental aspects of the RNGHI concentrating our
discussion on erbium–doped ﬁbre lasers. Finally, in Sect. 5 we provide a general
discussion of the issue.

2.1 Modelling

In this section we introduce the standard two–level laser theory (Sect. 2.1.1).
We then discuss how the model can be applied to three– and four–level lasers
(Sect. 2.1.2), and how it can be generalized to treat the dependence of the

5

laser ﬁeld and of the pump ﬁeld on the radial coordinate (Sect. 2.1.3). Finally,
we determine the stationary singlemode solutions of the laser equations (Sect.
2.1.4, and we rigorously derive the laser equations in the uniform ﬁeld limit
(Sect. 2.1.5).

2.1.1 Two–level atoms

We consider a collection of
two–level homogeneously broadened atoms per
unit volume, with transition frequency ωa interacting with a linearly polarized,
plane wave, unidirectional electric ﬁeld of carrier frequency ωc, chosen as the
longitudinal mode frequency closest to ωa. The Maxwell–Bloch equations de-
scribing the system are [9, 11, 12, 46, 78]

2.1.2 Three– and four–level atoms

Real lasers are not two–level lasers, even those in which the lasing transition
can be well described as a two–level system. This is so because pump and relax-
ation processes connect, incoherently, the two lasing levels to some other levels.
Although under usual conditions (essentially when the relaxation rates of the
pumped transition are very large as compared with the rest of relaxation rates)
this incoherent coupling does not have any inﬂuence on the coherent dynamics
of the system, it turns out to be essential for understanding the meaning of the
laser parameters, particularly that of the pump parameter A. The connection
between the two–level theory and the description of three– and four–level lasers
(which are the usual schemes for describing real lasers) was ﬁrst treated, to
the best of our knowledge, by Khanin in his book [11], but he did not analyze
the consequences of the parameter transformations he derived. Later on, and
independently of Khanin, these transformations were derived again in [77] 4,
and their inﬂuence on the understanding of laser dynamics was clariﬁed. The
relation between two–level and three– and four–level lasers is important in our
context because we will apply our analysis especially to rare–earth doped ﬁbre
4In [77] equal relaxation rates for the two lasing levels in four–level lasers were assumed.
This is not a realistic approximation for Nd:YAG lasers. In [79], following [11], it was shown
that the same model can be derived even removing that assumption

lasers, where the active medium should be properly modelled as a a collec-
tion of three– or four–level atoms if the dopants are, respectively, Erbium or
Neodymium atoms [76].

Eqs. (18–20), describing two–level lasers, are valid also for three– and four–
level atoms provided a dependence on the rate of incoherent optical pumping
Wopt is included in the parameters γ
and d0 [77, 79]. Precisely, we deﬁne the
k
adimensional pumping rate

where γ2 is the total spontaneous decay rate from the upper level of the lasing
transition. Then, the parameter transformation necessary for applying Eqs.
(18–20) to three– and four–level lasers are

and

where δN,3 is the Kroenecker δ and N is the number of atomic levels. Thus,
δN,3 = 1 for three–level atoms, and δN,3 = 0 for four–level atoms.

In ﬁbre lasers the gain parameter a is usually deﬁned in a way diﬀerent from
Eq. (5). If σe and σa are, respectively, the stimulated emission and absorption
cross sections, one has [76]

a = N
2

[σe −

σa + (σe + σa)d0] .

Assuming σe = σa, the gain coeﬃcient turns out to be proportional to the
equilibrium total population diﬀerence per unit volume

d0, as in Eq. (5)

N

a = σeN
Under this approximation, taking into account the deﬁnition of the pump pa-
rameter A, Eq. (13), and Eq. (26), the dependence of the pump parameter on
the pumping rate W can be expressed in the following way

enters in the normalizations used for writing Eqs. (18–20),
and as this parameter is pump dependent in the case of three– and four–level
lasers, Eq. (25), this must be taken into account when interpreting the results
derived from Eqs. (18–20). The recipe is very simple: (i) replace A by using Eq.
(29), and (ii) replace the spatial frequency α by α√1 + W in the ﬁnal expressions

(see following sections). This last replacement is due to the normalization of
the axial coordinate and, consequently, of the spatial frequency, see Eq. (16).

The most relevant feature of Eq. (29) is that the eﬀective two–level pump
parameter A depends on the actual pump strength W in a non–linear fashion
for both three– and four–level lasers. Although the instability threshold will
be discussed below, let us comment that for three–level lasers the relationship
between A and W and the fact that usually G
1 imply that the “factor–
of–nine”(the ratio of A at the RNGHI instability threshold and at the laser
threshold) (see Sect. 2.2.2 below) becomes a “factor of (1 + ǫ)”for W , which is
the actual pump parameter that can be measured in an experiment [77]. This
is very easy to see: From Eq. (29)

where the limit corresponds to large G again. We see that the instability thresh-
old for four–level lasers is larger than that of two–level lasers, tending to it for
very large gain.

2.1.3 Transverse eﬀects

So far we have limited our analysis to the plane wave approximation. However,
transverse eﬀects may play an important role in real experimental situations. In
ﬁbre lasers, for instance, both the laser and pump ﬁeld have a transverse spatial
structure and the doped region has a ﬁnite extension [76].

To include these elements in the laser equations we ﬁrst notice that the
(4), are no longer
deﬁnitions of the dynamical variables F , P and D, Eq.
appropriate, because such deﬁnitions contain the parameters γ
and d0 which
k
depend on the pump W . If W is allowed to vary spatially, this introduces an
undesired spatial dependence in the dynamical variables. The problem can be
removed by introducing a new deﬁnition of F , P and D

Now we must include in these equations the dependence of the electric ﬁeld
F on the transverse coordinate. We assume that the laser ﬁeld is a Gaussian
beam with 1/e radius equal to w0, which is a fairly good approximation [76].
This implies that in the Maxwell–Bloch equations all the dynamical variables
depend also on the radial coordinate r through the scaled coordinate ρ = r/w0,
and in the equation for the electric ﬁeld a term describing diﬀraction must be

2.1.5 The uniform ﬁeld limit

A widely adopted approximation in the study of laser dynamics is the so–called
Uniform Field Limit (UFL), which is based on the assumption that the steady
state of the electric ﬁeld is nearly constant along the propagation direction inside
the amplifying medium. In other words, in the uniform ﬁeld limit the electric
ﬁeld obeys a periodic boundary condition, as if the cavity mirrors were perfectly
reﬂecting. From the analytic point of view this represents a great simpliﬁcation
of the problem, because it allows for an expansion of the electric ﬁeld in terms
of the Fourier modes exp (iαnζ) of the empty cavity, where αn = n˜α is the
frequency of the n–th mode and the singlemode stationary solution associated
with mode n = 0 is spatially homogeneous. From the numerical point of view,
the beneﬁts of the UFL are even more relevant, because the expansion of electric
ﬁeld in Fourier modes allows to transform the original set of Maxwell-Bloch
equations from partial diﬀerential equations to ordinary diﬀerential equations,
which can be numerically integrated much easier and faster. Although our work
on the RNGHI shows that the above mentioned features of the UFL persist
even outside that limit for class B lasers (see Sect. 2.3), in the most complex
situations – for instance when transverse eﬀects or inhomogeneous broadening
are included in the model – we still limit our analysis to the UFL for the sake
of algebraic simplicity.

In [80] we introduced a new technique for dealing with the UFL. In compar-
ison to the standard technique [56], the new technique is advantageous because
it allows to clearly demonstrate that the only requirement for applying the UFL
is that the resonator reﬂectivity must be close enough to unity (the single-pass
gain does not have to verify any constraint). In [80] the simplest case of exact
resonance and absence of distributed loss was considered. In this section we
show, following [80], how the Maxwell-Bloch equations in the UFL can be de-
rived for homogeneously broadened lasers in the plane wave approximation in
the presence of both detuning and distributed loss. The generalization to other
situations (including, e.g., transverse eﬀects or inhomogeneous broadening) is
straightforward.

To derive the dynamical equations in the UFL we ﬁrst observe that in the

(58), we ﬁnd that the stationary phase also varies linearly along ζ according to
the simple expression

tion (62). Yet, they are still equivalent to the original Maxwell–Bloch equations,
and this fact is reﬂected in the dependence on ζ of η and Is. But from Eqs.

superﬂuous. Notice also that the amount of distributed loss does not inﬂuence

2.2 The RNGH instability in the uniform ﬁeld limit

The uniform ﬁeld limit (UFL), rigorously introduced in Sect. 2.1.5, is the case
in which the RNGHI can be analyzed in the simplest way, as well as the limit
where the eﬀects of additional features not considered in the original analyzes by
Risken and Nummedal [29] and by Graham and Haken [30] can be studied most
easily. Still another reason for the interest in the UFL is that it still captures
the very basic signatures of the multimode instability of ring lasers found in
more complex models.

In this section, we shall ﬁrst derive again the classical results of RNGH (Sect.
2.2.1). Then we shall consider the relevant case when the population inversion
is an extremely slow variable (class B laser). This applies, in particular, to ﬁber
lasers (Secs. 2.2.2 and 2.2.3). Next we will show that detuning plays no role
in class B lasers (Sect. 2.2.4). Finally, we shall analyze the spatial (transverse)
eﬀects due to the modal structure of ﬁber lasers (Sect. 2.2.5).

2.2.1 The RNGH instability

The original studies by RNGH [29, 30] considered a perfectly resonant two–level
ring laser in the UFL. The Maxwell–Bloch equations that describe such laser
are given by Eqs. (73)–(75) introduced in Sect. 2.1.5 with ∆ = 0

supplemented by the periodic boundary condition

The steady, spatially uniform, lasing solution is given by Eq. (62) with ∆ = 0

where φ is an arbitrary phase, and it exists for A > 1 (A = 1 corresponds to
the ﬁrst laser threshold). This solution is the basic, singlemode lasing solution.
Other singlemode solutions exist (in fact an inﬁnite countable set) that can
be obtained from Eqs. (77)–(80) by setting F (ζ, τ ) = Fs,n exp [i (n˜αζ
ωnτ )],
P (ζ, τ ) = Ps,n exp [i (n˜αζ
ωnτ )], D (ζ, τ ) = Ds,n. These solutions were com-
puted in Sect. 2.1.5 outside the UFL and correspond to diﬀerent values of the
longitudinal index n. As we showed in that section, all these additional single-
mode solutions have a larger oscillation threshold and hence solution Eq. (81)
is the ﬁrst lasing mode.

−

−

Stability of this singlemode solution is analyzed by perturbing the state of

the system as

F (ζ, τ ) = Fs + eiφδF (ζ, τ ) ,
P (ζ, τ ) = Ps + eiφδP (ζ, τ ) ,
D (ζ, τ ) = Ds + δD (ζ, τ ) ,

and linearizing the dynamical equations for the perturbations. The study is
facilitated by expressing any perturbation δX in terms of its real (δXR) and
imaginary (δXI) parts — note that δD is real by deﬁnition. The system of
equations can be expressed in vector form as

with Fs, Ps, and Ds given by Eq. (81).

Because of the linear nature of the system (85), any solution −→δX can be
λ −→δX λ (ζ) eλτ . On the other hand, given the depen-
calculated as −→δX (ζ, τ ) =
dence of L on the spatial coordinate ζ only through the gradient ∂ζ , any −→δX λ (ζ)
P
can be written as −→δX λ (ζ) =
α −→δX λ,α exp (iαζ). (Outside the UFL, this ansatz
is not valid; see below.) Hence any solution −→δX can be ﬁnally calculated as

Thus the dynamical problem (85) is transformed into the following eigenvalue
problem

−→δX λ,α

where Lα is given by matrix L with ∂ζ substituted by iα. Given the block-
diagonal form of Lα the characteristic polynomial
(λ; α) that determines the
Lyapunov exponents λ is factorized as

These polynomials, equated to zero, allow to determine the dependence λ (α) of
the eigenvalues on the spatial frequency α of the sidemode perturbation. The
boundaries of the unstable domain for the multimode instability correspond
= 0) = 0 (for α = 0 one is considering the well known
to cases where Reλ (α
singlemode, or Lorenz–Haken, laser instability, which is not treated here). The
singlemode solution will become unstable against sidemodes of spatial frequency
α if Reλ (α) > 0.

It is easy to show that

PI has no roots with Reλ (α) > 0 for any α. Only
marginally λ (α = 0) = 0 is always a root. This solution does not entail an
instability as it never gets positive real part; in fact that root is merely reﬂecting
the phase arbitrariness of the lasing solution. As
PI is associated with the
subspace formed by col (δFI, δPI), see Eqs. (85) and (86 ), and that subspace
controls the possible growth of perturbations in phase-quadrature with the lasing
mode, one concludes that the RNGHI is not a phase instability but an amplitude
instability [29, 30]. This result remains valid outside the uniform ﬁeld limit, as
well as when other factors (inhomogeneous broadening, etc) are included, as far
as the resonance condition is maintained. As we discuss below (Sect. 2.2.4),
detuning does not have any inﬂuence in the stability of class–B lasers, which
are our main interest. Nevertheless, in class–A and class–C lasers, detuning has
a large inﬂuence on the stability properties [41, 43, 57].

Regarding the polynomial

PR — which, mutatis mutandi, governs amplitude
instabilities — the boundaries of the multimode instability are found by setting
λ =
iω. Upon splitting the thus obtained polynomial (now in ω) into its real
and imaginary parts and by equating them to zero one can solve for α and ω as

to obtain a wealth of analytical information. The latter does not show up in
the “classical”version of the RNGHI we have just considered, as the linear sta-
bility analysis of the singlemode solution against multimode perturbations is
completely analytical. In this section we apply the class B limit to the general
expressions already obtained above. In the following section we show how the

The critical pump Ac is obtained from Eq. (93) by making γ = 0 and reads

which is in fact the minimum value Ac can attain. As the ﬁrst (lasing) threshold
occurs at a pump A = 1, we conclude that in order to have a RNGHI the pump
parameter A should be at least a factor of nine greater than its value at lasing
threshold. This is the famous “factor–of–nine”.

As for the sidemode critical frequency αc, we obtain

Ac = 9,

αc = √12.

So far we have assumed implicitly a continuum of longitudinal modes la-
belled by their wavenumber oﬀset α. But it must be remembered that the
periodic boundary condition (80) imposes, in particular, that the perturbation
wavenumber α must be an integer multiple of the scaled cavity free spectral
range ˜α, Eq. (16)

As already advanced in Sect. 2.1.2, for four–level lasers the situation is quite

dramatically [77] as we discuss next. On the one hand the critical value for two–

2.2.3 Asymptotic expansions for class B lasers

→

The results discussed in the previous section have been obtained by applying the
class B limit γ
0 to the general expressions obtained in Sect. 2.2.1, which are
valid for arbitrary values of the laser parameters. In other instances (e.g., outside
the uniform ﬁeld limit) this strategy is not possible as general expressions are not
available. In such cases one can still obtain a lot of analytical information if the
study is done, ab initio, for class B lasers. Those treatments rely on asymptotic
expansions of the problem that use γ as a smallness parameter. Although in the
UFL this analysis is not necessary, we prefer to introduce the technique at this
point as here the explanations are more transparent and straightforward than
in more complex cases that will be considered below.

The starting point of the analysis is the characteristic polynomial governing
the RNGHI, which must be equated to zero in order to obtain the eigenvalues
λ that govern the stability of the singlemode lasing solution. In the UFL it is
given by Eq. (89), which we recall for convenience

The analysis can stop here as Reλ2 is not identically zero. The instability
boundary Reλ = 0 reads in this case Reλ2 = 0, which exactly reduces to the
instability boundary for class B lasers Eq. (94), or Eq. (101), as can be checked
easily. Regarding the oscillation frequency at the instability threshold, which
we denoted by ω in the previous sections, it corresponds to Imλ. To the leading

This kind of analysis will be used later in order to treat more involved
problems which, usually, do not admit general analytical expressions to which

To conclude, we note that the above expansion assumes implicitly that all
parameters are of order γ0. Obviously, additional scalings can be incorporated
if needed, as it occurs in the next section. For instance, in order to fully under-
stand the bifurcation in the presence of inhomogeneous broadening, the scaling

2.2.4 Role of detuning in class B lasers

Throughout this paper we shall be dealing with resonant models, as we have
just done in the previous sections. Here we prove that detuning between the
cavity and the gain line, which is almost unavoidable in real experiments, can
be ignored in class B lasers. This is important as it demonstrates that the
predictions of resonant models remain valid, to the leading order, even when
cavity detuning is present. The analysis will be done in the UFL for the sake of

24

of ∆. For that we note, based on the results of the resonant model discussed
in the previous sections, that ˜α must be at most a quantity of order γ0 for the
instability to occur at physically realizable pumping levels. Hence ∆ is, at most,
of order γ. This is shown by the following argument: As the case of small ˜α

case, as discussed in Sect. 2.2.2, the ﬁrst sideband (α = ˜α) is the one with
lowest instability threshold, whose value is given by Eq. (101). The asymptotic

entanglement between the real and imaginary parts of the ﬂuctuations, and
the ﬁfth order characteristic polynomial cannot be any longer factorized as in
the resonant case, Eq.
(87). The analysis of the eigenvalues is much more
complicated and it is convenient to apply the asymptotic expansion presented in
Sect. 2.2.3. We do not give the details of the derivation, which is straightforward
but lengthy. We just want to emphasize that the relevant eigenvalue obtained
in this way reads λ =
, where λ1 and λ2 are the very
same we obtained in the resonant case analyzed in Sect. 2.2.3. In particular this
means that the detuning ∆ = γ∆1 does not have any inﬂuence to the leading
order (probably it appears at corrections of order γ3 or smaller, but these do
not control the instability). The conclusion is then clear: In class B lasers the
inﬂuence of the cavity detuning does not show up to the leading order. Then
one can safely ignore that detuning and the results obtained in resonant models
can be considered as an excellent approximation to detuned models.

2.2.5 Spatial eﬀects

When the plane–wave approximation is abandoned and one assumes, more re-
alistically, that the laser operates on the fundamental Gaussian mode (TEM00),
the RNGHI (as well as the Lorenz–Haken instability) turns out to be strongly
inﬂuenced by the relative size of the beam and the amplifying medium. If rm
is the radius of the amplifying medium and w0 the beam waist, the relevant
parameter is um = 2(rm/w0)2. In two–level lasers it was demonstrated that the
instability disappears in the limit um ≫
1 [82, 83, 84], but it is recovered as
soon as um becomes of order unity [85, 86]. This result can be easily under-
1 of very narrow amplifying medium
stood considering that in the limit um ≪
the model equations for a Gaussian beam reduce to those of the plane–wave
approximation, because the wavefront can be assumed to be plane inside the
amplifying medium. The results of [86] apply well to ﬁbre lasers, where the
dopant is usually conﬁned inside the ﬁbre core, whose radius rcore is typically
smaller than the waist of the laser beam. Yet, we know that when considering
ﬁbre lasers one must distinguish between three– and four–level atoms, because
of the diﬀerent dependence on the pump of the equilibrium population diﬀerence
d0.

The Maxwell-Bloch equations for a Gaussian beam in three– and four–level
lasers are Eqs. (42–44), derived in Sect. 2.1.3. Here we limit our analysis to the
UFL. Following the same steps as in Sect. 2.1.5, it can be easily shown that the
Maxwell-Bloch equations in the resonant case in the UFL are [79, 87]

F (0, u, τ ) = F (ζm, u, τ ) ,

ζm = 2π/ ˜α .

(114)

Here we assumed without loss of generality that both F and P are real. We
recall that β is the intensity of the pump ﬁeld, and the parameter η is deﬁned as
η = (w0/wp)2, where wp is the waist of the pump beam. The parameter δN,3,
which is equal to 1 for three–level lasers and to 0 for four–level lasers, makes
the diﬀerence between the two situations.

Transverse eﬀects in Erbium–doped (three–level) ﬁbre lasers were investi-
gated in [87]. It was assumed that the dopant is conﬁned inside the core of the
ﬁbre, i.e. rm ≤

rcore. The ratio

xdop =

rm
rcore

(115)

was used as a free parameter, ranging 0 to 1. For ﬁbre lasers of the type used
in [72] adequate parameters are wp = 2.086 µm and w0 = 2.828 µm, which
implies η = 1.839, and rcore = 1.875 µm [72, 76]. Since um can be written
as um = 2(rcore/w0)2x2
The proper pump parameter now is the pump intensity β. We call β1 the

lasing threshold and β2 the threshold for the RNGHI. The minimum instability
threshold, which is the one corresponding to the critical frequency space αc
where the upper and lower instability boundaries merge, is denoted by β2,min.
A ﬁrst important result is shown in Fig. 4, where the dependence of β1 and
β2,min on the normalized doped radius xdop is shown for three experimentally
accessible values of the gain parameter G . All curves display a vertical asymp-
tote for small doped regions, and it may be noted that, for each value of G, the
asymptote for β2,min corresponds to a value of xdop which is about three times
larger than the one associated with the asymptote for β1. The existence of these
asymptotes can be explained making reference to the plane–wave limit, to which
the model reduces in the limit xdop →
0) [87]. It can be
shown that the two asymptotes are well approximated by xdop = 1/√0.879G
and xdop = 3/√0.879G, where the factor 0.879 comes from um = 0.879 x2

0 (which implies um →

dop.

Thus, there exists a band of values of xdop between the two asymptotes,
where singlemode lasing is stable for all pump strengths. One is tempted to
conclude that to stabilize the laser it suﬃces to dope only a small fraction of
the ﬁbre core. But Fig. 4 also tells us that the lasing threshold β1 rapidly
increases for small xdop, which means that, for a given pump β, the output
intensity decreases. A compromise between stability and not too low output

28

intensity must be found.

Fig. 5 shows how the output intensity I depends on xdop for four increas-
ing values of the pump intensity β, and G = 200. All curves are similar and
display a maximum that shifts to larger doped area radii as β increases. Also
displayed, as a dashed line, is the critical intensity I2,min associated with the
minimum instability threshold β2,min. All stationary intensities in Fig. 5 which
are above I2,min are unstable (multimode emission takes place). We show only
the case G = 200 for the sake of clarity. The vertical asymptote of I2,min cor-
responds to that of β2,min in Fig. 4 for G = 200. Interestingly, I2,min shows a
relatively large plateau for 0.4
0.7. In this region the maximum stable
singlemode intensity available is almost insensitive to xdop, what constitutes a
genuine transverse eﬀect, not explainable in the plane–wave limit.

The best operating conditions are given by an interplay between plane–
wave limit and transverse eﬀects. In the particular case considered (G = 200),
the plane–wave limit indicates that stable singlemode emission is guaranteed if
0.1
0.25, but in this region very large values of the pump intensity
are required in order to obtain a large output intensity. However, the particu-
lar dependence of the output intensity on xdop, which is a consequence of the
transverse proﬁle of the laser and pump beams, shows that stable emission with
suﬃciently high intensity can be achieved for smaller pump intensities when the
radius of the doped area is larger (xdop ≃
A similar analysis was performed in Ref. [79] for a ring Nd:YAG (four–level)
laser using Eqs. (111–113) with δN,3 = 0. At diﬀerence with the erbium–doped
ﬁber laser, in the case of a bulk Nd:YAG laser the dopant distribution can be
assumed to be homogeneous, and to some approximation the same holds for
the pump (at least in side-pumped designs). Then, the only transverse eﬀects
that have to be taken into account are the Gaussian proﬁle of the laser ﬁeld
and the ﬁnite dimension of the active medium (the laser rod). In [79] it was
demonstrated that the instability occurs whenever the beam waist w0 is slightly
larger, or at least equal to rm, the radius of the active medium’s rod. To
accomplish this is not a trivial task, as it is discussed in detail in [79], but it
seems feasible with present day technology. As Nd is a four–level medium, in
this case the instability to lasing threshold ratio is slightly larger than 9 in the
optimal conditions (see Sect. 2.1.2), i.e., in this case the instability threshold is
well separated from the lasing one. We refer the reader to [79] for full details.

2.3 Outside the uniform ﬁeld limit

The study of lasers instabilities outside the uniform ﬁeld limit is in general a
diﬃcult task, because even the stationary state is spatially dependent [58]. But
the best candidates for the observation of the RNGHI are ﬁbre lasers, for which
the UFL usually does not apply, because the eﬀective reﬂectivity parameter
R
is far from unity. On the other hand, these lasers satisfy very well the class–B
5 [72, 77, 88, 89]. This is a
limit, because the parameter γ is as small as 10−
fortunate circumstance because, as we shall show in the present section, at least
in the study of the RNGHI, the class–B limit is as powerful as the UFL, in

29

R

the sense that the analytical results obtained in the UFL can be generalized to
arbitrary

in class-B lasers.

Speciﬁcally, in this section we will show that for class–B lasers outside the
UFL the following results hold: (i) the boundaries of the stability domain of
the homogeneous solution can be determined analytically, (ii) the simple self–
pulsing solutions can be studied in a completely analytic way, (iii) the multimode
dynamics arising from the instability can be described in terms of a limited
number of Fourier modes. In all cases cavity detuning will be ignored after the
discussion in Sect. 2.2.4.

This section is organized as follows: In Sect. 2.3.1 we derive the RNGHI out-
side the UFL. Then we generalize the result by taking into account distributed
losses (Sect. 2.3.2).
In Sect. 2.3.3 we derive generalized rate equations for
class–B lasers, and in Sect. 2.3.4 we use those equations to analyze self–pulsing.
In Sect. 2.3.5 we discuss the issue of the numerical integration of the model
and present some numerical results in order to compare the diﬀerent integra-
tion methods. Finally, in Sect. 2.3.6 we address the issue of the super– or
sub–criticality of the bifurcation.

2.3.1 RNGH outside the UFL

First we consider the case when no distributed losses exist in the laser cavity
(χ = 0) and recall the Maxwell–Bloch equations (18)–(20) valid in the resonant
case

where ζ = 0 and ζ = ζm denote the location of the entry and exit faces of the
active medium, and ˜α is the scaled cavity free spectral range, Eq. (16).

In these equations we have assumed that the ﬁelds F and P are real because
we showed in Sect. 2.2.1 that in the resonant case and in the UFL, the RNGHI
is an amplitude instability. Lifting the UFL does not change the nature of the
bifurcation, as can be checked following the lines of our study in Sect. 2.2.1.

Unlike in the UFL, now all variables at steady state are in general functions
of the coordinate ζ, as we showed in Section 2.1.4 . According to Eq. (54) the

As in previous sections, the linear stability analysis is performed by writing
F (ζ, τ ) = Fs (ζ) + δF (ζ) exp (λτ ), and similar expressions for P and D, and

linearizing the resulting dynamical equations. As now the problem depends
explicitly on the longitudinal coordinate ζ and the boundary condition is not
periodic, one cannot make the ansatz δF
exp (iαζ) as in the UFL. In fact, now
the spatial dependence of δF is unknown a priori and an equation for it must be
sought. After solving for the material perturbations we set δF (ζ) = Fs(ζ)δf (ζ)
and obtain the following equation for δf

To conclude, let us remark that unlike in the UFL now the value of cavity
. In the UFL cavity
loss inﬂuences the second-to-ﬁrst threshold ratio through
loss aﬀects the pump values necessary for lasing and for instability, but not their
ratio. This fact marks a way for separating experimentally the two thresholds
in erbium–doped ﬁber lasers (remember that for these lasers Wc/Won = 1 + ǫ in
the UFL, i.e. for small cavity losses, rendering the observation of the instability
diﬃcult). This is the strategy followed in the experiments [88, 89], which are
treated in detail in Sect. 4.

2.3.2 Role of distributed losses

Another factor present in almost any experiment and not considered by the
standard RNGH theory is the existence of distributed losses along the ampli-
fying medium, apart from those localized outside it. The two types of losses
should have diﬀerent consequences as the role of distributed loss should be to
decrease gain, while localized loss determines the eﬀective reﬂectivity value

whose inﬂuence has been studied above. An analysis of the combined eﬀects of
distributed and localized losses can be found in Ref. [78], which we summarize

The intensity of the singlemode solution along ζ, and its value at the medium
exit plane are given, respectively, by Eq. (52) and Eq. (53) with ∆ = 0, and
the lasing threshold is A = 1. The linear stability analysis of the singlemode
solution follows the lines of the previous sections. As shown in [78] the main
eﬀect of distributed loss is to favor the multimode instability, i.e., to reduce the
instability to lasing threshold ratio (of course, the larger the losses the larger
the pump needed for reaching both the lasing and instability thresholds). For
instance, the minimum reﬂectivity value allowing the existence of the RNGHI,

value of G0 and the dashed line corresponds to G0 → ∞

important question is whether this conclusion can be extended to three– and
four–level lasers: The answer is that it cannot. For example, Eq. (135) is only
valid for two–level lasers, i.e., it cannot be directly translated for three– and
four–level lasers (this is due to the way it is derived, see the discussion in [78]).
When
Rmin is calculated for three–level lasers, the result is that of Fig. 9, which
tends to the two–level laser result only for very large G.
In general, although the eﬀect of distributed losses can be neglected for
two–level lasers, as discussed above, this will not be so for three– and four–level
lasers. The origin of this diﬀerent behavior lays in the fact that distributed losses
enter into the deﬁnition of the pump parameter, Eq. (13), through G, Eq. (30).
Nevertheless, the analysis we carried out for two–level lasers leads to a simpliﬁed
way of treating distributed loss, as long as it is not too large (roughly, smaller
than 10 dB): Perform the linear stability analysis without taking distributed loss
into account (which is accurate for two–level lasers), and then take distributed
loss into account when translating the results derived for two–level lasers into
three– and four–level lasers through G, Eq. (30). We have checked that this is
a very accurate way of deriving the stability properties for three– and four–level
lasers for not too large distributed loss. We shall make use of this simpliﬁed
way of treating distributed losses in Sect. 3.3 when inhomogeneous broadening
be included

36

2.3.3 Rate equations

Class–B lasers are usually treated with rate equations, which are derived by
equating to zero the time derivative of the medium polarization. If this is done
in Eqs. (18–20), then the RNGHI is lost. This means that in order to capture
the RNGH instability, coherent eﬀects (i.e., those due to the atomic polariza-
tion) must be preserved in the equations: The standard adiabatic elimination
technique fails in this case.

Nevertheless, the above circumstance does not prevent the derivation of gen-
eralized rate equations that maintain enough information on the medium po-
larization dynamics as for correctly describing the RNGHI. This is what we do
in this section: We derive a reduced set of rate equations, in which the po-
larization variable is adiabatically eliminated in a generalized sense [91]. The
derivation of these equations stems from the observation that the RNGHI in-
stability can be captured only if in the stability analysis terms up to order γ2
are kept. Therefore, the instability certainly disappears if the rate equations
are derived by means of a standard adiabatic elimination of the polarization,
which amounts to truncate the polarization to the term of order γ0. But with
a more reﬁned adiabatic elimination, where terms up to order γ2 are kept in
the polarization, we can derive a set of generalized rate equations that describe
perfectly the RNGHI.

To derive the rate equations we start from Eqs. (68–70) introduced in Sect.
2.1.5 for the primed variables F ′, P ′ and D′. The most noticeable property of
those equations is that, although they are valid outside the UFL, they admit as
a stationary solution the singlemode solution of the UFL (62). In the following
we will consider power expansions of the dynamical variables in terms of the
small parameter γ. To this aim it is convenient to work with variables which,
at the leading order, are of order 1. Therefore, we introduce the new dynamical
variables f , p and d deﬁned as

f (ζ, τ ) =

p (ζ, τ ) =

and the stationary solution is fs = ps = ds = 1. To obtain the correct rate
equations we ﬁrst observe that, by setting γ = 0 in Eqs. (142–144), we obtain:
(i) ∂τ d = 0, hence d (ζ, τ ) = d0 (ζ), (ii) p = d0 (ζ) f , and (iii) (∂τ + ∂ζ)f =
ση(ζ) [d0 (ζ)
1] f . Note that these equations do not ﬁx the value of d0 (ζ).
However, since it is independent of time, it must be compatible, in particular,
with the stationary solution d = 1, which implies d0 (ζ) = 1. Hence, at order
0 in γ we have d = 1 and f = p, from which it follows that ∂τ f =

2.3.4 The pulse equation

The simplest multimode solution which arises from the RNGHI consists in reg-
ular pulses travelling along the cavity. If the homogeneous stationary solution
is ﬁrst destabilized by the N –th sidemode, N identical pulses are present simul-
taneously in the cavity. A semi–analytical study of the pulse solution can be
already found in [31]. In 1989 Fu analyzed in detail the pulses and their stability
in class–B lasers [62]. The results of Fu were obtained in the UFL. Using the
rate equations (150) and (151) derived in the previous section we can not only
quickly recover them, but extend them to a class–B laser outside the UFL.

We look for a solution of Eqs. (150) and (151) which travels at velocity v

along the cavity. To this aim we introduce the new variable τ ′ = τ

The stability of the N –pulse with N

2 was analyzed in [62] in the UFL
using the Floquet method.
It was found that the N –pulse solution becomes
unstable beyond a certain value of Imax which depends only on N . For instance
Imax = 4.914 for N = 2 and Imax = 2.339 for N = 3. For N = 1 the stabil-
ity analysis is more diﬃcult and, to our knowledge, it remains an unresolved
problem.

2.3.5 Numerical results

In the previous section we have illustrated a method to calculate the N –pulse
multimode solution developed by the laser beyond the RNGHI threshold. In this
way we can determine at once the long-term regime of the laser, skipping all
the transient evolution. This is an enormous advantage from the computational
point of view, because we know that the unstable eigenvalue is of order γ2,
which means that the time scale of the transient is of order γ−

2.

But when the pulse solution itself destabilizes, the only way to study the laser
dynamics is the numerical integration of the dynamical equations (18–20), with
the boundary condition (21)8. These are Partial Diﬀerential Equations (PDEs)
8The pulsing regime has been studied numerically by few authors [31, 32, 42, 43, 46, 66]

that can be integrated using the ﬁnite diﬀerence method originally proposed by
Risken and Nummedal [31]. However, the eﬃciency of this method is strongly
limited by the the fact that it imposes the constraint of equal time and space
step. Since the time step is proportional to γ, in the limit of very small γ the
computational time diverges, because the above mentioned constraint implies
that the number of points of the spatial grid is proportional to γ−

1.

An alternative method consists in a modal expansion of the electric ﬁeld
in Fourier modes, which allows to convert the PDEs into a set of Ordinary
Diﬀerential Equations (ODEs). The big advantage of ODEs is that they can be
integrated using standard Runge-Kutta methods, which are easier to implement
and generally run faster than the ﬁnite diﬀerence methods used for integrating
PDEs.

It is commonly believed that modal expansion is convenient only in the
UFL, because only in that limit the electric ﬁeld can be described properly by
a limited number of modes. Outside that limit, even the stationary solution
requires a high number modes, because it has a nontrivial spatial dependence
along the longitudinal direction [56], and the situation certainly worsens when
the RNGHI sets on.

However, it was demonstrated that in class B lasers a modal expansion of
the electric ﬁeld is fully justiﬁed for the study of the RNGHI, even outside the
UFL, i.e.
for any mirror reﬂectivity [80]. This result is a simple consequence
of the fact that, according to Eq. (122) derived in Section 2.3.1, the unstable
modes in the RNGHI depend on ζ as

Fs(ζ) exp [

λnζ

cases: (i) in the UFL, and (ii) in the class–B limit γ

at the leading order the unstable modes can be approximated by

Fs(ζ) exp (iαnζ) .

(170)

−

In the UFL, where Fs = √A
1 can be assumed independent of ζ, the unstable
modes immediately coincide with the empty cavity modes exp (iαnζ). But this
is true also for class–B lasers beyond the UFL, provided the scaled electric ﬁeld
f deﬁned by Eq. (137), which is equal to 1 in the stationary state, is considered
in place of F . Therefore, the modal expansion can be applied to the Maxwell-
Bloch equations (138–140) written in Sect. 2.3.3 for the scaled variables f , p
and d and to the generalized rate equations that we derived from them. In both
cases the periodic boundary condition

f (0, τ ) = f (ζm , τ ) ,

ζm = 2π/ ˜α ,

and these studies have been quite superﬁcial in most cases.

The integral can be evaluated over a grid of points ζl, l = 1, . . . L. To do that
we need to know only the values of p and d in those points. Thus, we have
to consider a set of ODEs for the mode amplitudes fn(τ ) and the variables
pl(τ ) = p(ζl, τ ) and dl(τ ) = d(ζl, τ ).

For the rate equations we proceed similarly, but with two big advantages:
the number of ODEs is smaller because the polarization has been adiabatically
eliminated, and the stiﬀness of the equations has been reduced because the fast
time scale associated with the polarization has disappeared.

Summarizing, we can then use three diﬀerent methods to study numerically
the laser equations: (i) the ﬁnite diﬀerence method applied to the full Maxwell-
Bloch equations, (ii) the modal expansion technique applied to the Maxwell-
Bloch equations, and (iii) the modal expansion technique applied to the rate

equations. Method (iii) is expected to be more eﬃcient than method (ii), and
method (ii) more eﬃcient than method (i). On the other hand, only method (i)
is applied to the full set of Maxwell-Bloch equations, while with methods (ii)
and (iii) some approximations are introduced.

In Figs. 10 and 11 the symbols refer to the calculations made with method
(ii), but on that scale the results of the three methods are hardly distinguishable.
A better check of the correctness of the three methods and of their respective
eﬃciency is the comparison among the shape of the calculated pulses and that
of the semi–analytic pulse solution found in the previous section, which is the
result to which any dynamical simulation must tend in the limit γ

As expected, for the smaller value of γ the agreement between the numerical
simulations and the analytic result is better. As for the computation times, for
γ = 0.01 the ratios among the three methods are 5.8:1.6:1, so their eﬃciency is
still comparable. But for γ = 0.001 the ODEs derived from the rate equations

PDEs are already too slow to converge in a reasonable time. These results

2.3.6 Subcriticality of the RNGH

An important issue of the RNGHI that we have referred to only superﬁcially in
Sect. 2.3.4, is the subcritical or supercritical character of the bifurcation leading
from singlemode to multimode emission. This issue has been considered in the
past, as we detail below, within the UFL and may be important for the correct
understanding of the experimental results, see Sec .4. We will here present
some numerical results outside that limit, and therefore treat this question in
this section.

In their second paper of 1968 [31], Risken and Nummedal already treated
this question. They commented on their numerical ﬁnding that multimode
emission persisted for a given pump even when the spatial frequency α was
, see Eq. (125), where the linear stability analysis predicts
decreased below α
stable singlemode emission. They explicitly comment that for α < α
there is
bistability between the singlemode and the multimode solutions.

−

−

Later on, Haken and Ohno [38, 39] obtained an equation for the critical mode
and found this coexistence of solutions again. In fact they derived a condition
for supercritical or subcritical bifurcation but they did not give the dependence
on the wavenumber α of their result because of the excessive complexity of their
equations. Lugiato et al.
[46] derived an approximated multimode solution
(from a ﬁve–mode truncation of the Maxwell–Bloch equations) that explicitly
showed the bistable behavior. The question was taken up again by Fu [62] who
derived the unambiguous condition in the limit of class–B lasers that we have
already found in Sect. 2.3.4: The bifurcation is supercritical (subcritical) when
α > αc (α < αc). Finally, Carr and Erneux [64] analytically obtained the same
result in a slightly diﬀerent limit for class–B lasers (γ
1, which in our
||
notation corresponds to small γ and large σ).

/κ

≪

As stated, all these studies were carried out within the UFL. The meaning of
these results is that multimode emission could be found for parameter settings
for which the singlemode solution is still stable. Nevertheless, in all previous
studies, the minimum instability threshold pump rc = 9 for class-B lasers was
found to be a lower bound for multimode emission. Outside the UFL this ques-
tion has not been treated before, to the best of our knowledge. The analytical
treatment has in fact been presented in Sect. 2.3.4, where we have commented
on this. Here we present preliminary numerical results [92] obtained with the
the modal expansion technique applied to the rate equations (150,151). In Fig.
14 we represent both the linear stability multimode emission threshold and the
(numerically determined) domain of existence of stable multimode emission as a

the multimode solutions is very large and, consequently, multimode pulsations
could be experimentally observed for parameters for which the theory predicts
singlemode emission. We shall come back to this later on when discussing the
experimental observations.

3 MULTILONGITUDINAL MODE EMISSION

IN INHOMOGENEOUSLY BROADENED RING
LASERS

Up to now we have only considered ring lasers with a homogeneously broadened
active medium. Nevertheless most lasers present some kind of inhomogeneous
broadening in the gain line: In gas lasers the Maxwellian distribution of atomic
velocities introduces Doppler broadening, and in solid state and ﬁbre lasers
diﬀerences in the sites of excited atoms introduce some spread in their transition
frequency [11, 22, 23, 24].

From the point of view of multimode emission, inhomogeneous broadening
in ring cavity lasers is of primary importance as it is well known that these

47

lasers easily emit in several longitudinal modes because of spectral hole burning
[11, 22, 23, 24]. This mechanism for multimode emission is intuitively under-
stood by imagining the diﬀerent cavity modes, whose frequencies fall within the
inhomogeneous linewidth, interacting independently with diﬀerent subsets of
atoms whose frequencies are quasiresonant with that of each longitudinal mode.
If the diﬀerent mode frequencies are well separated, as compared with the ho-
mogeneous linewidth, the above is a good picture of what actually happens in
most inhomogeneously broadened ring lasers. When the frequencies of adja-
cent modes are moved closer together, or when their intensities grow and they
undergo power broadening, some interaction between the modes may appear,
mainly through saturation eﬀects. All this has been well known for a long time
and is not particularly exciting from the viewpoint of laser instabilities.

Nevertheless this image may be too naive: In the previous sections we have
analyzed in detail how Rabi–splitting induced gain leads to multimode emission
in homogeneously broadened lasers. Then natural questions arise immediately:
How does this mechanism aﬀect multimode emission in inhomogeneously broad-
ened lasers? Or in other terms, how does inhomogeneous broadening aﬀect the
RNGHI? Are there two diﬀerent mechanisms, namely Rabi–splitting induced
gain and spectral hole burning, for multimode emission in inhomogeneously
broadened lasers?

The rest of this section is organized as follows. In Sect. 3.1 we present the
Maxwell–Bloch and rate equations models. Then we analyze the multimode
emission threshold, ﬁrst in the UFL (Sect. 3.2) and then outside this limit
(Sect. 3.3). In Sect. 3.2 we pay special attention to the comparison between
Maxwell–Bloch equations and rate equations.

3.1 Modelling

As in the previous sections, we consider an incoherently pumped two–level ac-
tive medium of length Lm, contained in a ring cavity of length Lc, interacting
with a unidirectional plane wave laser ﬁeld. However, now the ﬁeld interacts
with an inhomogeneously broadened active medium. We model the medium by
considering a Lorentzian distribution of atomic frequencies. We further assume,
for the sake of simplicity, that the cavity is resonant with the center of the
atomic transition frequency distribution.

3.1.1 Maxwell–Bloch equations

The Maxwell–Bloch equations describing such a laser can be easily written by
generalizing Eqs. (18–20). The generalization consists in replacing the polar-
ization appearing in the ﬁeld equation Eq. (18) by the weighted sum of the
polarizations corresponding to the diﬀerent frequencies ω. The model equations

Notice that distributed losses have been neglected (χ = 0) and resonance has
been assumed between the cavity and the center of the atomic frequency distri-
bution (δ = 0).

In Eqs. (174)–(176) F (ζ, τ ) is the normalized slowly varying envelope of
the laser ﬁeld, and P (ω, ζ, τ ) and D(ω, ζ, τ ) are the normalized slowly varying
envelopes of the medium polarization and the population inversion, respectively,
for molecules detuned by ω with respect to the cavity resonance.

In these equations, the integer index n denotes the n-th longitudinal mode with
respect to the central resonant mode (n = 0). As we show below, the rate

actually be quite short.

3.2 Multimode emission in the uniform ﬁeld limit

The stability properties of the uniform ﬁeld limit were treated ﬁrst by Mandel
[53, 54] (see also [12]), who showed that in the limit u
, the multimode
emission threshold is just above the lasing threshold. The general case has been
treated at depth in [81], and the reader is referred to that publication for full
details.
Eqs.

(175,176,179) have two stationary solutions: The laser–oﬀ solution
(F = 0, P = 0, D = 1), and the monomode solution, for which the intensity of
the lasing mode, I0 = F 2, can be written as A = √1 + I0
. The
threshold for lasing emission is found by taking I0 = 0 in this expression, and
1 + u. Then, by deﬁning the normalized
thus it occurs at a pump A = A0 ≡
pump parameter r = A/A0, the lasing solution reads

3.2.1 Two estimates of the multimode emission threshold

Let us assume momentarily the following na¨ıve approach: Assume that the
threshold for ampliﬁcation of a detuned mode is not aﬀected by the already
existing resonant lasing mode. This assumption will be reasonably accurate
whenever (i) the inhomogeneous width u is large, because in that case the
intensity I0 of the resonant mode at threshold for multimode emission will be
small, and (ii) when the frequency Ω of the detuned mode is (suﬃciently) larger
1 (which is a measure of the width
than the normalized homogeneous width γ−
of the spectral hole), i.e., for large α.

In [81] we showed that under these assumptions the emission threshold for

a sidemode of spatial frequency α can be estimated to be given by

rthr(α) = 1 +

rthr,B(α) = 1 +

γα

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

where the limit corresponds to class–B lasers (γ
1). Thus multimode emission
occurs, in this simple approach, for r > rthr. The term γα/(1 + u) represents
the sidemode frequency oﬀset divided by the sum of the cavity linewidth and
the total gain linewidth. One can think of Eq. (187) as the multimode emis-
sion threshold when spectral hole burning is the only relevant mechanism for
multimode emission and there is not any interaction between modes.

≪

A second, more accurate, estimate for the multimode emission threshold for
class–B lasers is obtained from the rate equations model, Eqs. (181, 182). The
derivation can be found in Chapter 4 of Khanin’s book [11] (see also [81]). It
reads

0 = p (R) + γ2α2,

p (R) = R2(1

u) + R(1

u)(u + 2) + (u + 1)2 ,

when the cross relaxation coeﬃcient γCR is set equal to zero in Khanin’s equa-
tions [11]. By using Eq. (184), the above equation can be rewritten as

(188)
(189)

(190)

rrate = rthr,B(α) +

with rthr,B (α) given by Eq. (187) and R given by Eq. (185), the monomode
rthr,B(α), i.e., the
solution being unstable for r > rrate. We see that rrate ≥
instability threshold given by Eq. (190) is always larger than the one predicted
1. Both boundaries tend
by Eq. (187), which was admittedly valid for α
to coincide in the limits of validity of Eq. (187), i.e., u
1. This is perfectly
reasonable as Eq. ( 190) contains one more ingredient with respect to Eq. (187),
namely the saturation of the sideband gain due to the resonant mode, which
explains why it gives a larger value for the instability threshold.

≫

≫

Notice that Eq. (190) predicts that there will be no multimode emission un-
less u > 1, i.e., it fails in predicting multimode emission due to Rabi–splitting
induced gain (RNGHI). This is entirely normal as the rate equations do not

51

contain information about the atomic coherence, i.e., about the medium polar-
ization dynamics, which is the responsible for the RNGHI as we have seen in
the previous section. On the other hand, the limitation u > 1 does not appear
in the na¨ıve approach of Eq. (187). Then the physical picture is the following:
For u < 1, even if the threshold for emission for more than one mode is crossed,
the nonlinear competition between the diﬀerent cavity modes enforces that only
one of them lases. This is an example of “the winner takes all”competition and
is the common picture of multimode dynamics — which we know to be false
because of the RNGHI.

The existence of a minimum instability threshold in the limit α

0 pre-
dicted by the rate equations, Eq. (190), is quite unphysical, because it would
mean that the closer are the sidemodes to the central mode, the lower is its
instability threshold. This erroneous result is a consequence of the approxima-
tions introduced in the derivation of the rate equations, and it disappears when
the stability analysis of the homogenous solution is performed using the full
set of Maxwell–Bloch equations. As will be shown below, the complete model
predicts that, for a given pump value, there is always a minimum value of the
frequency spacing α below which there is no instability because the gain of the
sidemodes is saturated by the strong central mode.

3.2.2 Multimode emission threshold

The multimode emission threshold is rigorously obtained by performing a lin-
ear stability analysis of the single–mode solution Eq.
(184). The analytical
expressions obtained are cumbersome and it is not trivial to extract analytical
information. We refer the interested reader to [81] where several limits of inter-
est are treated explicitly. Here we shall make a resume of the results concerning
class–B lasers. Two limits of interest can be treated explicitly for class–B lasers:
The short and long cavity limits, i.e., the limits α
(1) or smaller.
1, the instability threshold turns out to be given by
Eq. (190). This amounts to saying that for short cavities the rate equations
approach is valid for deriving the multimode emission threshold.

the approximate expression Eq. (191) becomes invalid for large α (short cavity);
(iii) The unphysical instability predicted for small α by the rate equations
result is removed, and there is a minimum value of α below which there is no
instability; and

(iv) there is a domain of intermediate cavity lengths where the two analytic

expressions connect.

The last item allows to determine which is the value of the cavity length
beyond which the rate equations approach is no more valid. By analyzing Eqs.
(188) and (191) one obtains that the distance between the two functions is min-

Then, for cavities larger than Lcoh, atomic coherence eﬀects (i.e., Rabi–

The above shows that Rabi–induced sidemode gain (RNGHI) is far from be-
ing a negligible mechanism for multimode emission in inhomogeneously broad-
ened ring lasers. Quite to the contrary, it is an essential ingredient for those
lasers with cavity lengths larger than Lcoh or even shorter if the ratio of inho-
mogeneous to homogeneous linewidth is small.

3.2.3 Dynamics beyond the multimode emission threshold

The numerical integration of the inhomogeneously broadened model is far from
being a simple task, especially for class–B lasers. In fact, this task has been
carried out very recently for the ﬁrst time in [94]. For the sake of illustration,
let us comment that some of the calculations we comment below implied a
running time of more than one month on a R12000 Silicon Graphics processor.
This illustrates the enormous diﬃculties of making numerical simulations for
class–B laser parameters, due to the stiﬀness of the equations in this limit.
[95,
There were previous attempts, during the eighties, by Brunner et al.
96] of numerically studying multimode emission in inhomogeneously broadened
lasers. But the model they used was that of a standing–wave cavity and the
third–order Lamb theory approximation was assumed. As this approximation
does not contain atomic coherence eﬀects, their results did not give information
about the RNGHI mechanism in standing–wave lasers.

1, 10−

2, and 10−

In [94], the Maxwell–Bloch Eqs. (175,176,179) and the rate equations model
Eqs. (181,182) were numerically integrated for ﬁxed pump (r = 5), inhomo-
geneous broadening (u = 2) and spatial frequency (equal to the homogeneous

linewidth), and three diﬀerent values of γ (10−
the value of γ over three orders of magnitude, we change the Rabi frequency of
the ﬁeld. In doing so, the behavior makes the transition from that predicted
by the rate–equations model (for smaller γ) to that in which Rabi–induced
gain eﬀects are expected to be important (for larger γ). The main ﬁnding in
[94] consists in the conﬁrmation of the conclusions extracted from the stability
properties: Rate equations describe properly the multimode dynamics only for
short cavities, that is, under conditions for which the free spectral range is large
as compared to the Rabi frequency of the intracavity ﬁeld. In this limit rate
equations and Maxwell–Bloch equations provide the same results for the mode
intensities at steady state, and no phase locking is found even in the Maxwell–
Bloch equation, where all relevant information about the phase dynamics is

preserved (remember that mode–locking cannot be described by the rate equa-
tions model as modal phases do not enter in the dynamics of mode intensities
and population inversion, see Eqs. (181–183)). Then, for short cavities the use
of rate equations is perfectly legitimate.

This is no longer true for longer cavities, where the inhomogeneously broad-
ened laser behaves like a homogeneously broadened one, with a multimode dy-
namics which presents all the features of the classical RNGHI: The number of
excited modes is larger than expected from linear stability considerations and
phases spontaneously lock, giving rise to regular pulses in the total intensity.
We refer the reader to [94] for full details.

3.3 Multimode emission outside the uniform ﬁeld limit

R

Outside the uniform ﬁeld limit, i.e., for arbitrary values of the amplitude re-
ﬂectivity
the analytical expressions for the instability threshold are much
more involved than in the uniform ﬁeld limit previously analyzed. For class–B
lasers the problem has been treated in detail in [93], and the interested reader
is referred to that paper for full details. Here we shall stress some important
points.

As it happens in the homogeneously broadened model, a decrease in the
leads to an increase of the multimode emission threshold. This can

as the inhomogeneous width or larger. This marks an important diﬀerence with
the case of homogeneous broadening. The fact that this qualitative change
appears at u = 1 can be related to the fact that the rate equations model
predicts the multimode instability only for u > 1. This result suggests that
for u > 1 spectral hole burning makes multimode emission possible when the
Rabi–induced gain mechanism could not do it by itself (i.e., there is no more

Rmin, which is a characteristic of the RNGHI), while for u < 1,

This result is particularly relevant from the experimental point of view: An
increase of the cavity losses eventually leads to the impossibility of multimode
emission when u < 0.9 (i.e., for homogeneously broadened lasers or lasers with
small inhomogeneous broadening), but this does not happen for lasers with
enough inhomogeneous broadening at u > 0.9.

3.3.1 Eﬀect of distributed losses in three–level and four–level lasers

In Sect. 2.3.2, where homogeneous broadening was considered, it was shown
that distributed losses have quantitative importance for the determination of
the multimode emission threshold for three– and four–level lasers, although it
was not really important for two–level lasers as far as distributed losses have
reasonable values, roughly below 10dB. The reason lies in the way how losses
enter in the transformation of the pump parameter for applying the results of
the two–level theory to three– and four–level lasers.

For inhomogeneously broadened lasers the same argument holds, and dis-
tributed losses must be taken into account when calculating the multimode
instability threshold for three– and four–level lasers. Performing the linear sta-
bility analysis with inhomogeneous broadening and distributed losses outside
the uniform ﬁeld limit is a very heavy task that does not provide any analytical
insight. Rather than going to that trouble, it suﬃces at least in the case of not
too large distributed losses to use the results of the linear stability analysis out-
side the uniform ﬁeld limit without distributed losses, and introduce them when
calculating the transformation of the pump parameter, as already explained in
Sect. 2.3.2. This is the way we calculated the instability threshold presented
in [89] and reproduced in the following section (cf. Fig. 21 below). For more
details, see Ref. 24 in [89].

4 ON EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF THE
MULTIMODE INSTABILITY IN EDFL’s

In this section we describe experimental observations that contribute to the dis-
cussion of multimode laser instabilities. We already discussed in Sect. 1 that
experimental research on the RNGHI has been limited to the dye laser [44, 45]
and that the observed multimode emission was explained as being caused by
the band structure of the lasing levels [47, 48, 49], not a manifestation of the

58

RNGHI. Prior to Refs. [71, 72] no other experimental work on the subject has
appeared. The reason is probably that the constraints imposed on the cavity
length by Eqs. (93) and (100) have discouraged experimentalists: According
to Eq. (100), cavity lengths need to be enormously long (in some cases sev-
eral orders of magnitude longer than standard values), while at the same time
there is the requirement of a very large instability to lasing threshold ratio (the
“factor–of–nine”) [2]. By now it is known, however, that the “factor–of–nine” is
irrelevant if the active medium is better modelled as a three–level laser medium.
Moreover, for such lasers Eq. (100) does not constitute a hard limit, as for cavity
lengths well below this value instabilities occur at accessible pump values. This
makes it much more likely that the RNGHI becomes observable in some lasers.
By this reasoning, Er-doped ﬁber lasers are rendered the most promising
candidate for a clear observation of the RNGHI: these are three–level lasers,
and their cavities can be made very long. We will therefore concentrate on this
laser type.

Many laser applications require monochromatic operation, and therefore sev-
eral researchers attempted to operate Er-doped ﬁber laser in single mode op-
eration. However, after many failures and a few partial successes, this is now
considered as notoriously diﬃcult. Where it was attempted, researchers chose
one of these strategies: (i) increase the cavity’s eﬀective free spectral range
beyond the gain bandwidth (see, e.g., [97]), or (ii) reduce the gain bandwidth
below the free spectral range by insertion of ﬁlters with very narrow bandwidth
(see, e.g.
[98]). None of these approaches led to a full success. For example,
in a publication subsequent to [98] it is reported that single mode operation
became impossible to maintain above a certain pump level [99]. The reason for
this behavior was not further investigated.

The pragmatic conclusion is that EDFL’s obviously have a natural tendency
to operate on several modes simultaneously. The small free spectral range caused
by the necessarily long resonator contributes to the diﬃculty, but by itself cannot
explain the underlying reason.

4.1 A ﬁrst dedicated approach

Probably the ﬁrst experimental study of fundamental causes for the instability
of an EDFL was presented in [71]. The authors made a distinction between
relaxation oscillation and self mode locking, and investigated the latter. They
used a resonator consisting of a WDM coupler to bring in the pump light, and an
output coupler to steer fully 90% of the power out. A polarization-insensitive
optical isolator enforced unidirectional operation. An Er-doped active ﬁber
provided gain; alternatively either a 15 m length at low dopant concentration
(300 ppm), or a 0.8 m length at high concentration (
5000 ppm) was used. Al-
lowing for some extra length of component pigtails, this brought the resonator’s
free spectral range to about 10 MHz or 70 MHz, respectively.

≈

The laser output was directed through another isolator and then monitored
either by a fast photodiode hooked up to a fast oscilloscope or an RF spectrum
analyzer, or by a background-free autocorrelator. No stable cw emission was ob-

59

served. For the longer cavity it was reported that self-modelocking produced a
train of pulses with a repetition rate given by the resonator’s free spectral range.
An occasional presence of satellite pulses at intermediate times was mentioned.
The pulses were reported to have a temporal width (FWHM) of a few ns. In-
spection with the autocorrelator was performed to check for substructure. The
autocorrelator could monitor a time window of 50 ps, and within this window
no substructure was found. For the shorter cavity, a modulation of the output
power at the free spectral range was also observed. However, it did not take
the form of pulses but rather had a nearly sinusoidal shape. This is plausible
because for a larger free spectral range, fewer modes will fall into the bandwidth
of the gain.

When the pump power was varied near lasing threshold, in the shorter cavity
the instability was seen whenever there was lasing, while in the longer cavity a
small interval of single-mode operation seemed to exist just above lasing thresh-
old.

4.2 The follow-up

In a subsequent study [72], basically the same group of authors replaced the
polarization-insensitive isolator with a polarizing isolator. They also added po-
larization controllers to the cavity. Two output couplers branching out 95%
or 50% were used alternatively. The active ﬁber was again of the low Er con-
centration type, and was 13 m long. The cavity free spectral range was thus
near 10 MHz. Again, self mode locking at the cavity free spectral range was
observed; pulses had a duration of 1.74. . . 3.00 ns. The RF spectrum contained

≈

250 beat notes, indicative of a similar number of oscillating modes.
In this experiment there was a combination of ﬁber birefringence plus po-
larizing elements in the cavity. This raises the issue whether mode locking due
to Nonlinear Polarization Rotation (NPR) might have occurred. The authors
argue that NPR can be ruled out for the following reasons: (i) In the previous
setup, there deﬁnitely was no picosecond structure, and when the polarizing
isolator was introduced, the pulse shape was not modiﬁed. This suggests —
somewhat indirectly — that the polarizing action is not responsible. The au-
thors further noted that (ii) at times intermediate to the pulses there was a
constant background of random signal, possibly satellite pulses of some kind,
and that NPR would likely suppress such structure. However, random groups
of pulses are routinely seen in NPR lasers. Finally, (iii) power levels in the ﬁber
were deemed insuﬃcient for NPR, in particular since a wide core ﬁber was used.
NPR requires remarkably little power, however, and at the powers stated, NPR
cannot be ruled out entirely. However, the authors kindly inform us that the
instability also existed just above threshold, and in that case NPR is indeed
highly unlikely to occur.

There remains an unresolved discrepancy about the measured spectral shape
of the pulses which is reported to be Gaussian and, for 2 ns pulses, must have
been 0,001 nm wide. The optical spectrum analyzer reportedly used for this
measurement, however, has a speciﬁed spectral resolution of 0,05 nm.

60

One of the most prominent features of RNGHI, namely its threshold-like
onset, was not addressed in the experiment of [72]. The publication provides a
comment that the experiments took place far above lasing thresholds, but that
instability persisted down to at least a less-than-tenfold threshold power. As
the authors kindly inform us, the instability was seen immediately above lasing
threshold. From this information one must conclude that the matter deserves

4.3 A systematic assessments of thresholds

In subsequent work, an Er-doped ﬁber ring laser speciﬁcally designed for obser-
vation of instabilities was set up by some of the present authors. As a starting
point a standard conﬁguration was chosen, see Fig. 19. The cavity contained
8.2 m of active ﬁber (585 ppm Er dopant level) in a 22 m long ring (the remain-
der consisted of standard single mode ﬁber). Pump light came from a 100 mW,
980 nm laser diode; it was launched into the ring by a WDM coupler. Light
coupled out by this WDM coupler, and also from an additional 95/5 coupler,
was used to monitor the system simultaneously by a fast photodiode and an op-
tical spectrum analyzer. An optical isolator ensured unidirectional operation,
and a moderately narrow bandpass ﬁlter gently restricted the bandwidth avail-
able for lasing to about 1 nm. As a unique feature, variable loss was inserted
into the cavity. To this end either an amplitude modulator or a tight ﬁber
coil with well–deﬁned radius was employed. High variable loss served to bring
out the onset of instability more clearly. Great eﬀort was made to character-
ize the exact amount of loss for each setting: all components (localized losses)
including splices etc. were tested individually, and the distributed loss in the
Er ﬁber was determined. Finally, as a cross-check the total loss was calculated
from the operational laser’s output power vs. pump power relation. For more
detail see [89].
Just above lasing threshold this laser indeed operated in a
single longitudinal mode. As the pump power was increased, modulations of
the output power appeared at frequencies which were integer multiples of the
cavity round trip frequency (9 MHz) without exception. Obviously these were
beat notes between diﬀerent longitudinal modes.

These beat notes, however, were neither steady in amplitude, nor in fre-
quency: The frequencies involved hopped rapidly and apparently at random all
across the range up to several GHz, and during much of the time in between
there was no beat at all. After the insertion of the bandpass ﬁlter already men-
tioned above, the frequency hopping range was limited to hundreds of MHz and
thus more manageable. Still, the beats remained unsteady. A typical beat note
episode lasted on the order of tens of milliseconds to a few seconds. The tempo-
ral proﬁle of the beat note was almost always very nearly sinusoidal, indicative
of a beat between only two resonator modes. In the presence of the high loss
intentionally introduced here, the laser could not be pumped very far above
threshold, so that it may be not too surprising that there was just dual–mode,
but no multimode operation.

We wish to point out that for this experiment nonlinear polarization rotation

loss; it can take the form of either an electro–optic modulator or a tightly wound
ﬁber coil. For further detail see text.

(NPR) [100] can be safely ruled out. Polarization-dependent losses, on which
NPR hinges, were carefully avoided.

Given a random phenomenon, statistical means were employed to character-
ize it. Time series of the instantaneous power were recorded which — in view of
the typical timescales — were chosen to be several seconds long. Unfortunately,
adequate sampling to correctly assess all up to the highest frequencies would
have required data rates of GB/s and ﬁle sizes of about 10 GB per shot; that
is just not feasible. To keep data ﬁles at manageable size, undersampling at
20 000 samples per second was chosen. While this way information about the
actual beat frequency is lost, all episodes of mode beating longer than 100 µs
still can be detected from the time series. Shorter episodes seemed not to occur
anyway. Occasional occurrences of relaxation oscillation were easily identiﬁed
in the ﬁle by their very diﬀerent amplitude, and were discarded. The fraction
of time during which valid mode beats were detected served as the measure of
instability M .

The data-taking procedure consisted in setting a particular loss value, then
incrementing the pump power in small steps, and determining M at each step.
(At the same time, as described above, the total power was recorded to help
assess the loss value). Next, the loss was incremented, and the procedure was
repeated until the accessible range of loss values was exhausted. After an eval-
uation of these extensive data, the following conclusions are reached: The laser
power data in Fig. 20 show the universally known threshold behavior: the
power is close to zero below threshold, but not exactly so due to ﬂuorescence.
Above threshold the power makes a good ﬁt to a straight line by which the slope
eﬃciency is deﬁned. The measure of instability, on the other hand, strictly re-
mains at zero up to some point above the laser threshold. Beyond that point,
M sharply sets on to nonzero values, and continues to rise as the pump power

is raised further. This is clear evidence that the instability has a well-deﬁned,
sharp onset, a fact which had not previously been demonstrated experimentally.
In the next step both the lasing threshold and the instability onset are
taken from data as in Fig. 20. Fig. 21 reveals that the ratio of both values
Pinst/P0 (where Pinst and P0 denote the pump power at the instability and lasing

thresholds, respectively) does indeed scale with loss. At low loss, Pinst/P0 ≈
Under typical operating conditions of Er ﬁber lasers, losses would be even lower,
and experimenters would be unable to tell apart both onsets. For larger loss,
however, Pinst/P0 increases up to about 1.5. The intentionally high loss of this
experiment pays oﬀ nicely here: Both onsets are clearly distinguishable, and
the interval of single mode operation in between is clearly identiﬁable. This
constitutes a considerable progress over previous work.

However, we must emphasize an important fact regarding the range of loss
values used in that experiment. We showed in Sect. 2.3.1 that in a homoge-
neously broadened gain medium

to 4.5 dB of localized loss in the experiment [89], but Fig. 21 clearly shows that
instability persists at much higher loss.

To resolve this discrepancy, we reconsider the structure of the Er gain line.
In Sect. 3.3 we showed that in the case of an inhomogeneous contribution
to the line as expressed by u
Rmin goes to zero (see the discussion of
Eq. 197 and Fig. 18); hence the corresponding maximum loss diverges. It is
diﬃcult to make precise statements about the value of u for the ﬁber used in the

experiment in [89], but a choice of u = 2 is reasonable. For this value, Fig. 22
shows the theoretically expected threshold ratio as a function of localized cavity
loss (the calculation takes distributed losses into account, see [89] for details).
Evidently, the disagreement with experimental data is reduced dramatically.
While quantitatively r is systematically predicted too high, in particular at the
highest loss values, at least the discrepancy about the existence of an instability
onset is resolved.

Finally we need to address a caveat about the interpretation of the exper-
imentally observed instability onset. As was discussed in Secs. 2.3.4,2.3.6, the
possibility exists that the instability threshold is either a supercritical or a sub-
critical bifurcation. Based on experimental data alone, a decision between these
possibilities cannot be made. Consider a subcritical bifurcation, which would
in all likelihood imply a range of bistability between the single–mode and the
multimode solution (at least this is the case in the homogeneously broadened
case, see Fig. 18). The observed intermittent behavior would make some sense

64

Figure 22: Ratio of instability onset to lasing threshold, as predicted by a
three–level laser model with inhomogeneous broadening at u = 2. Diﬀerent
modes become unstable at diﬀerent points; the labels refer them to the central
lasing mode. For the instability onset, always the lowest line counts.

in that case: The experimentally determined instability onset would then be the
lower limit point of the unstable branch, and the bifurcation proper was never
reached due to limited available pump power. In fact, not even the point of
”Maxwell’s construction” (where both branches are occupied for equal amounts
of time on average) was reached. Even if unlimited pump power had been avail-
able, it is not at all clear whether a ﬁnal conclusion about the nature of the
bifurcation could have been reached, because a sizeable increase of the pump
power eventually brings on other processes like Brillouin scattering, thermal
eﬀects, etc., which further complicate the issue. We must therefore leave this
question open for now.

Let as ﬁnally remark that, in contrast to [72], multimode operation and
pulsing was never observed in [89]: there was only dual–mode operation and
sinusoidal modulation. Also, there were only intermittent, not steady, beat
notes between modes. Surely, this must have to do with the fact that the laser
was intentionally made lossy so that it could never be pumped very much above
its ﬁrst threshold. Whether there are still other factors involved (codopants of
the ﬁber, etc.) must remain unresolved at this point.

5 CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

We have introduced the diﬀerent models required for the study of the RNGHI.
In particular, we have treated the applicability of the two–level laser model
to three– and four–level lasers and, importantly, the rigorous derivation of the
uniform ﬁeld limit. We have then revised the basics of the RNGHI, and we have
reviewed our continued work on the subject over recent years. This research
was motivated by the suggestion by Lugiato and coworkers in 1997 [72] that the
pulsations exhibited by a unidirectional EDFL could be a manifestation of this
elusive phenomenon.

At long last, the threshold-like onset of the multimode instability in an
EDFL was demonstrated in [89]. Data show a qualitative and, with appropriate
corrections, even semi-quantitative agreement to theoretical expectations. Nev-
ertheless, data do not represent a clear-cut textbook rendition of the RNGHI,
but only an approximation. Therefore the bottom line of our combined theoret-
ical and experimental research is this: The processes observed in EDFLs very
likely constitute a manifestation of the RNGHI, but it is a manifestation in a
Inhomogeneous broadening, distributed losses, and the three–
’dressed’ way.
level structure of erbium ions take their imprint on the instability. Moreover, it
is very likely that noise plays a central role in the ’intermittent’ appearance of
multimode emission.

Theories are very often neater and much more elegant than real–world ex-
periments. The closest thing to Lorenz-type laser chaos that was ever found
experimentally suﬀered from complications that are absent from the model, as
we commented in Sect. 1. In a similar way, the experiment in [89] presents the
closest thing to RNGHI that has been found to date. In any case, we do not
have any doubt that the experimental observations are a clear manifestation of
the resonant Rabi instability, i.e., that Rabi sideband gain is the responsible for
the observed instability.

Another remarkable result of our research is that the RNGH mechanism
is essential for understanding the multimode emission threshold in inhomoge-
neously broadened lasers, even for relatively short values of the laser cavity
depending on the active medium. This fact suggests that RNGHI could be im-
portant for correctly understanding mode–locking in lasers with an accessible
coherence length (see Eq. (196) and the subsequent discussion).

Finally we would like to remark that there are open questions from both the
theoretical and the experimental sides. On the one hand, the observed intermit-
tent pulsations needs to be theoretically explained, and it must be determined
up to what extent subcriticality and noise could explain them, or wether other
phenomena we have not yet considered (such as dispersion or ﬁber nonlinear-
ity [67, 13]) need to be taken into account. On the other hand, experimental
research in other laser types, as NdDFLs or Nd:YAG lasers, would help to un-
derstand how the RNGH mechanism aﬀects real lasers.

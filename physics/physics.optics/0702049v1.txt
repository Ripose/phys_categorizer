We show that two-dimensional arrays of thin metallic wires can guide transverse electromag-
netic (TEM) waves and focus them to the spatial dimensions much smaller that the vacuum wave-
length. This guiding property is retained for the tapered wire bundles which can be used as multi-
channel TEM endoscopes: they capture a detailed electromagnetic ﬁeld proﬁle created by deeply
sub-wavelength features of the studied sample and magnify it for observation. The resulting imaging
method is superior to the conventional scanning microscopy because of the parallel nature of the
image acquisition by multiple metal wires. Possible applications include terahertz and mid-infrared
endoscopy with nanoscale resolution.

Diﬀraction of light is the major obstacle to a variety of applications requiring concentrating optical energy in a small
spatial volume: light cannot be conﬁned to dimensions much smaller than half of its wavelength λ/2. Applications that
would beneﬁt from overcoming the diﬀraction limit include nonlinear spectroscopy and harmonics generation [1, 2, 3,
4], sub-wavelength optical waveguiding [5, 6, 7], and nanofabrication [8]. Utilizing plasmonic materials with a negative
dielectric permittivity circumvents diﬀraction limit because interfaces between polaritonic (ǫ < 0) and dielectric (ǫ > 0)
materials support surface plasmons that can be conﬁned to sub-λ dimensions. Examples of diﬀraction-beating devices
based on plasmonics include superlenses [9, 10, 11, 12], coupled-sphere waveguides [13], and sharp focusing tips [14].
High losses associated with surface plasmonics are hampering many of these applications. Another challenge yet
to be met is designing practical imaging modalities based on sub-λ plasmons that convert near-ﬁeld electromagnetic
(EM) perturbations into the far ﬁeld where they can be easily observed. In this Letter we propose a solution to
these two problems: a tapered multi-wire array supporting sub-wavelength transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waves.
Examples of the multi-wire endoscopes based on such arrays (un-tapered and tapered) are shown in Fig. 1. We
have demonstrated that the tapered endoscope can accomplish two tasks: (i) creating near the base of an endoscope
a magniﬁed image of deeply sub-wavelength objects (metal spheres, in our case) placed at the endoscope’s tip [see
Fig. 3(a)], and (ii) creating near the tip of an endoscope a de-magniﬁed image of a mask placed at the endoscope’s base
[see Fig. 3(b)]. Accomplishing the ﬁrst task is necessary for making a sub-λ sensor while accomplishing the second
one – for making a sub-λ lithographic tool.

Single metallic wires and coaxial wire cones have recently attracted considerable attention as low-loss waveguides [15,
16] of TEM-like modes of THz and far-infrared radiation. Using a single wire waveguide has its limitations:
for
example, if a wire is used as a high spatial resolution sensor, then only a single bit of information can be collected
without scanning the wire. We demonstrate that a bundle of closely spaced wires can act as a multi-channel sensor
capable of simultaneously collecting information from a spatially distributed object. Electromagnetic properties of
metallic wire arrays has been previously investigated in the context of metamaterials [17, 18, 19, 20]. Below we
review the electromagnetic properties of an inﬁnite square array with period d of straight (along the z-direction)
metallic wires of an arbitrary shape in the x
y plane. Two well-known types of EM waves with the propagation
wavenumber kz and frequency ω characterized by the scalar potentials φ and ψ are supported: (i) transverse magnetic
(TM) modes with ~B = ~ez
⊥φ/ω, and (ii) transverse electric (TE) modes with

below, the remarkable property of the TEM waves of being dispersionless with respect to the transverse wavenumber
~k⊥ can be explored in sub-wavelength guiding/imaging applications. One can, therefore, view TEM modes as being
transversely local: the image of an object with ﬁnite transverse size does not spread out as it is transported along
the endoscope. To understand why the propagation wavenumber of TEM modes is degenerate in ~k⊥, consider a
ﬁnite N
N array of wires surrounded by a perfectly conducting metal shell. Finite extent of the array discretizes
~k⊥ so that there are N 2 distinct wavenumbers supported by the array. This is in agreement with the well known
fact [21] that the vector space of TEM potentials of a multiconnected coaxial waveguide has the dimension equal to
N wire bundle are capable
the number of inner conductors. Therefore, TEM modes of an endoscope consisting an N
of transferring N 2 channels of information along its length.

An ideal endoscope transfers an arbitrary image of the ﬁeld distribution at z = 0 over a signiﬁcant distance to
z = L with minimal distortion. Indeed, any ﬁeld distribution at z = 0 with an arbitrary spatial detail size ∆ << d
can be expanded as the sum of TE, TM, and TEM modes with the Bloch wavenumbers ~k⊥ and the Brillouin zone
index n, and propagated with their corresponding propagation constants k(i,n)
, where i = 1, 2, 3 correspond to TEM,
TE, and TM modes, respectively. However, if the total crossection of the tapered endoscope becomes smaller than
λ2/4, then all TE and TM modes are evanescent, i. e. k2(i,n)
< 0 for i = 2, 3. The only modes that can transport the
image without distortion are the TEM modes. Because they do not form a complete set, they can only ensure spatial
resolution of order the wire spacing d. Therefore, imaging with TEM waves is a form of discrete sampling: the exact
spatial proﬁle of a small scatterer with a spatial dimension ∆ << d will not be resolved in the image, but its presence
in a speciﬁc d
d unit cell will be detected. Because TEM modes have no cutoﬀ, making the spacing d extremely
sub-wavelength results in an arbitrary high spatial resolution.

To demonstrate how a metal wire endoscope can transport a deeply sub-wavelength image, we have numerically
3
simulated the following problem: transferring an image of a metallic sphere with a diameter D = λ/10 using a 3
array of conducting wires encased in a square λ/3
λ/3 sub-wavelength metal waveguide. Wire spacing and diameter
are d = λ/10 and w = λ/15, endoscope’s length is L = 4λ/3. All simulations in this Letter are made under a
simplifying assumption of perfectly electrically conducting (PEC) metals. As shown at the end of the Letter, this
assumption is valid for EM waves spanning mid-IR and THz frequency ranges. PEC boundary conditions make the
results scalable to any wavelength. Therefore, all dimensions are scaled to an arbitrary length scale L0 = λ/15.
Dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium was assumed to be ǫd = 1. The schematic of the endoscope is
shown in Fig. 1(left). The EM wave is launched from a single-mode square 2λ/3
10L0.
We have chosen a circularly polarized incident wave to avoid polarization sensitivity of a square array of wires. The
scattering metal sphere’s center is at zobj =
0.7D, x = xobj , y = yobj. Two lateral sphere positions have been
simulated: (a) (xobj =
d/2, yobj = 0), and (b) (xobj = d/2, yobj = d/2). The respective intensity distributions of the
~E⊥
2 at the end of the endoscope (z = 19L0) shown in Figs. 2(a,b) conﬁrm the earlier made statement about the
|
|
sampling nature of TEM-based imaging: only the mere presence of a scattering sphere inside a given elementary cell
is detected, with the details of the scatterer’s shape lost. Nevertheless, the spatial resolution equal to the size of the
unit cell d = λ/10 is clearly established by this simulation. The peak intensity in the imaging plane is higher by one
order of magnitude when the scattering object is present compared with the case of a multi-wire endoscope with no
scattering object: Iscatt/Iwire = 10. The latter intensity is another ﬁve orders of magnitude higher than when the
wires are removed from the waveguide: Iwire/Iwg = 105.

Next, we demonstrate that an endoscope based on a tapered metal wire array shown in Fig. 1(right) is capable
of magniﬁcation and demagniﬁcation. One obvious application of image magniﬁcation is a sensor collecting EM
ﬁelds from highly sub-wavelength objects in the immediate proximity of the endoscope’s tip and transforming them
into a much larger detectable image. Image demagniﬁcation can be applied to surface pattering and lithography:
a complex large mask can be placed close to the wide base of the endoscope and projected/focused towards the
tip creating a highly sub-wavelength intensity distribution in the tip’s vicinity. We’ve simulated a pyramid-shaped
metallized ﬁber threaded by a 3
10L0 square crossection
(where, as before, L0 = λ/15), wires separation is d = 3L0, wires’ diameters are w = 2L0. All these dimensions are
proportionately scaled down by a factor 5 at the tip. The purpose of this simulation is to illustrate image magniﬁcation
and demagniﬁcation by a factor 5. As in the non-tapered case, the tapered endoscope is terminated on both ends by
2λ/3) metallic waveguide. A practical multi-channel endoscope will have a much larger (e. g.,
a single-mode (2λ/3

For magniﬁcation demonstration, a small metallic sphere with diameter Dsmall = λ/25 is placed at a distance
∆z = 0.7Dsmall above the endoscope’s tip half-way between the central wire and the next one on the left. The sphere
2 taken at zim = L0
is illuminated from the top by a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave. The image of

(slightly above the endoscope’s base) is shown in Fig. 3(a). The sphere’s image (or that of any strong scatterer)
magniﬁed by a factor 5 appears as an enhanced ﬁeld in the image plane. The following intensity contrasts are found:
Iscatt/Iwires = 3 and Iwires/Iwg = 103.

The opposite process (de-magniﬁcation, or image focusing) can also be demonstrated using the same tapered
endoscope. A metallic sphere with the diameter Dlarge = λ/5 is placed at a distance ∆z = 0.7Dlarge below the
endoscope’s base half-way between the central wire and the next one on the left. The image located in the plane of
the tip (hot spot shown in Fig. 3(b)) is spatially compressed by a factor 5. Despite the fact that the electromagnetic
wave propagates through a very narrow waveguide, ﬁeld intensity in the hot spot is about the same as that of the
incident wave. Had the coupling eﬃciency of the incident wave into TEM waves been close to unity, one would expect
an intensity increase by a factor 25 due to the narrowing of the endoscope’s area. That this is not happening is
attributed to the low coupling eﬃciency because of the sub-wavelength size of the scattering sphere. Nevertheless,
this simulation illustrates that extremely sub-wavelength intensity landscapes can be created near the tip of a tapered
nanowire array. The following intensity contrasts are found: Iscatt/Iwires = 15 and Iwires/Iwg = 105.

All simulations presented in this Letter were performed using the PEC assumption. This assumption is highly
accurate in the far-infrared and THz frequency ranges.
It is, however, instructive to check whether the concept
of a multi-wire endoscope could be potentially extended to mid-infrared wavelengths. Below we demonstrate that
electromagnetic modes of an array of plasmonic wires closely resembling TEM modes of an array of PEC wires
do exist. These surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes possess two essential properties enabling them to guide,
focus, and perform local sensing on a nanoscale: (a) they are low loss, and (b) they are essentially dispersionless
in the transsverse direction, i. e. ω2/c2
α. Let’s consider λ = 5µm because of the
importance of this wavelength to chemical sensing [22] as well the availability of low-loss silica ﬁbers. We have used
a commercial ﬁnite elements code COMSOL to compute the propagation constants of such SPPs assuming a square
array of gold wires (d = 0.5µm, w = 0.33µm, ǫAu =
916 + 228i) embedded in a silica ﬁber with ǫd = 2.25. An
endoscope based on this wire array provides λ/10 spatial resolution. For the center of the Brillouin zone it was
found that ckz(~k⊥ = 0)/√ǫdω = 1.12 + 0.01i
χr + iχim conﬁrming low loss of the TEM-like SPPs. Very weak
dispersion of kz on ~k⊥ of the SPPs was conﬁrmed by calculating kz(kx = π/d) at the edge of the Brillouin zone:

8λ reduce the transmitted light intensity but do not necessarily
Ohmic losses over distances L > λ/2πǫd/χim
deteriorate the spatial resolution (λ/10) of the image. Transverse dispersion, however, reduces spatial resolution
below λ/10 for L > 42λ. For higher spatial resolutions, however, transverse dispersion become more severe than
Ohmic losses: an endoscope must be shorter than L = 5.5λ if the spatial resolution of λ/25 is desired. We conclude
from these results that, although the classic dispersion relation kz = √ǫdω/c for TEM waves is no longer strictly
satisﬁed for plasmonic wires, the TEM-like SPPs are suﬃciently low-loss and dispersionless that the performance of
the un-tapered and tapered multi-wire endoscopes described in this Letter are barely aﬀected. The actual fabrication
of tapered silica ﬁbers threaded by metallic wires can proceed according to the recently developed [23]high pressure
chemical vapor deposition technique.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the possibility of a novel deeply sub-wavelength multi-channel endoscope
based on an array of metallic wires. The device is based on the remarkable propagation properties of the transverse
electromagnetic (TEM) waves: their lack of the cutoﬀ and transverse dispersion. Such endoscopes may ﬁnd a variety
of applications in the areas of infrared imaging, guiding, and focusing. This work is supported by the ARO MURI

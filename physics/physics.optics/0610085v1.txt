The purpose of this note is to point out that McDonald’s criticism of our work [1] is based on a
circular argument. In order to show that the ﬁeld of a bounded source falls oﬀ as f (θ, φ)/r in the
far zone, McDonald uses a Huygens-Kirchhoﬀ diﬀraction integral whose derivation (from Maxwell’s
equations) already entails assuming a fall-oﬀ of this form for the ﬁeld at inﬁnity [2]. (r, θ and φ are
the spherical polar coordinates centred on a point within the source, and f is a factor independent
of r.)

Green’s theorem can be used to express a scalar ﬁeld
(e.g. a component of the electric or magnetic ﬁeld) inside
an empty closed volume V in terms of the values of the
ﬁeld and its normal derivative on the surface S bounding
V . The result, when the ﬁeld ψ(x, t) has a harmonic time
dependence exp(−iωt), is

ψ(x) = −

where R = x − x′, x and x′ are the position vectors of
the observation point and boundary points, respectively,
k = ω/c, and c is the speed of light in vacuo; see equation
(10.79) of Jackson’s Classical Electrodynamics [2].

This is not a solution to Maxwell’s equations but just
an identity. As emphasized by Jackson, to apply Eq. 1,
“it is necessary to know the values of ψ and n·∇ψ on the
surface S. Unless the problem has been solved by other
means, these values are not known” (page 480 of [2]).
Nor can one prescribe the values of both these quanti-
ties on S: the well-posed boundary conditions for the
Helmholtz wave equation (which is an equation of the
elliptic type) consist of specifying either ψ (the Dirichlet
boundary condition) or n · ∇ψ (the Neumann boundary
condition) on a closed surface (see page 37 of [2]).

In the diﬀraction context,

it is assumed that the
boundary S consists of two surfaces (S1 and S2) one of
which (S2) lies in the far zone. The integral over S is
thus divided into two parts, one over the screen and its
apertures (S1), the other over a surface at inﬁnity (S2).
The ﬁeld and its derivative at inﬁnity are then assumed
to satisfy

where r = |x|; see equation (10.78) of [2]. These are
the conditions that would hold only for a conventional,
spherically spreading radiation; there is no reason to as-
sume that they should hold for all emissions. Under these
conditions, the integral over S2 vanishes (see [2]) and the

ﬁeld can be expressed in terms of its value on S1, as
in equation (1) of McDonald [1]. Thus, the equation on
which McDonald bases his argument does not follow from
Maxwell’s equations unless one already assumes that the
ﬁeld decays like 1/r for r → ∞.

To derive the characteristics of the nonspherically de-
caying radiation beam that is generated in the exper-
it is essential that one takes
iments reported in [3],
account of retardation eﬀects [4, 5],
i.e. that one
solves Maxwell’s equations with a source term and with
Cauchy’s boundary conditions (see page 38 of [2]). Equa-
tion 1 is identically satisﬁed once one inserts the values
of ψ and n · ∇ψ from the retarded solution of the wave
equation into the kernel of the exact Huygens-Kirchhoﬀ
diﬀraction integral. The asymptotic conditions expressed
in Eq. 2, on the other hand, do not hold unless the known
solution used for obtaining the values of ψ and n · ∇ψ on
S describes a conventional, spherically spreading radia-
tion.
In the case of the nonspherically spreading radi-
ation generated by a rotating superluminal source, for
instance, the asymptotic value of ψ is proportional to
r−1/2, rather than r−1, for large r.

That this nonspherical decay of the ﬁeld does not con-
travene conservation of energy has now been explicitly
demonstrated in [6]. The part of the superluminal source
that makes the main contribution toward the value of the
nonspherically decaying ﬁeld has a ﬁlamentary structure
whose radial and azimuthal widths become narrower (as
r−2 and r−3, respectively), the farther is the observer
from the source. The loci on which the waves emanat-
ing from this ﬁlament interfere constructively delineate a
radiation subbeam that is nondiﬀracting in the polar di-
rection (see Fig. 1). The cross-sectional area of each non-
diﬀracting subbeam increases as r, instead of r2, so that
the requirements of the conservation of energy are met
by the nonspherically decaying radiation automatically.
The overall radiation beam within which the ﬁeld decays
nonspherically consists, in general, of the incoherent su-
perposition of such nondiﬀracting radiation subbeams.
(For a detailed discussion of these ﬁndings, see [6].)

2

A ﬁnal remark is in order: the far-ﬁeld approximation
to the retarded potential, given in equation (9.8) of [2],
does not support McDonald’s argument as claimed in the
ﬁrst footnote of [1]. In situations where caustics occur,
it is essential that one should evaluate the radiation in-
tegrals prior to proceeding to the far-ﬁeld limit. Because
it replaces the spherical wave fronts by planar ones, the
far-ﬁeld approximation obliterates signiﬁcant geometri-
cal features of the loci of stationary points of the phases
of the integrands in these integrals (see Section 4B of [5]).

FIG. 1: Schematic illustration of the light cylinder (the sur-
face on which a rigidly rotating extended source attains the
speed of light), the ﬁlamentary part of the source that ap-
proaches the observeration point with the speed of light and
zero acceleration at the retarded time, the orbit of this ﬁl-
amentary source, and the subbeam formed by the caustics
that emanate from the constituent volume elements of this
ﬁlament. The ﬁgure represents a snapshot corresponding to
a ﬁxed value of the observation time. The subbeam is diﬀrac-
tionless in the polar direction. The polar width of this sub-
beam decreases with the distance r in such a way that the
thickness of the subbeam in the polar direction remains con-
stant: it equals the projection of the length of the contributing
ﬁlamentary source onto a direction normal to the line of sight.
The azimuthal width of the subbeam, on the other hand, is
subject to diﬀraction as in any other radiation beam.

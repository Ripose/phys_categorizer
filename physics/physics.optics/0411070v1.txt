Abstract

The optical responses of structured array of noble-metal nanoparticle dimers immersed in a glass matrix

are investigated theoretically, motivated by the recent experimental observation of the splitting of the

surface plasmon bands in silver arrays. To capture the strong electromagnetic coupling between the two

approaching particles in a silver dimer, the spectral representation of the multiple image formula has been

used, and a semiclassical description of the silver dielectric function is adopted from the literature. The

splitting of plasmon resonance band of the incident longitudinal and transverse polarized light is found

to be strongly dependent on the particle diameter and their separation. Our results are shown in accord

with the recent experimental observation. Moreover, a large redshift for the longitudinal polarization can

be reproduced. The reﬂectivity spectrum is further calculated for a dilute suspension of dimer arrays.

INTRODUCTION

The optical properties of small metal clusters embedded in a dielectric medium have attracted

extensive attention in recent years.1,2,3,4,5 The studies have been developed into many new appli-

cations in nanostructure enhanced spectroscopies such as surface-enhanced Raman scattering and

single-target molecule detection,2,6,7 with near-ﬁeld observation on length scales smaller than the

wavelength of light. It is known that strong absorption of light occurs at certain frequencies due to

the collective motions of the conduction electrons in metal called the surface plasmon resonance, as

well as to the inter-band transition of electrons in deeper levels. The plasmon resonant frequency

depends strongly on the size and the geometry of the particles,3,8,9,10 as well as on the dielectric

function of metal and the surrounding medium.11 The studies are signiﬁcant theoretically because

these factors lead to characteristic charge conﬁnement and strong local ﬁeld enhancement.12 On

the other hand, these properties are also of practical importance in the context of future electronic

and optical device applications.

For isolated spherical particles with a diameter much smaller than the wavelength of light

(d

λ), the interactions between light and metal lead to an homogeneous but oscillating po-

≪

larization in the nanoparticles, resulting in a resonant absorption peak in the visible part of the

optical spectrum. The plasmon resonances in more complex structures of nanoparticles such as

concentric spherical particles, which are the spherical analog of planar multilayer heterostructures,

can be more complicated. These resonances are due to the hybridization of free plasmons, which

can be pronounced depending on the geometry of the particles.13,14,15 For nanoparticle ensembles

like metal clusters, however, the electromagnetic coupling between neighboring particles shifts the

plasmon absorption bands.16,17 For instance, a nanoparticle chain can be utilized for building opti-

cal waveguides in the nanoscale.18,19,20 These structures exhibit lateral mode conﬁnement smaller

than the optical diﬀraction limit, which cannot be achieved with conventional waveguides nor with

other novel technologies such as photonic crystals or plasmonic stripe waveguides.

In the linear arrays of nanoparticles, the optical response can generally be anisotropic, because

the interparticle coupling depends on whether incident light is polarized longitudinal or transverse

to the chain axis. This is also one of the underlying principles of optically dichroic glass. Nowa-

days, structured nanoparticle array can be easily made by electron-beam lithography21 or other

2

fabrication techniques.22 On the theoretical side, ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) simulation

methods can accurately reproduce the spectroscopic properties of plasmon waveguides and optical

pulse propagation in these structures as well.19 Nevertheless, theoretical investigations by the full

solution of Maxwell’s equations are complicated due to the coupling between plasmons of diﬀerent

modes. Although there are already some fruitful discussions,23,24 it is intrinsically a many-body

interaction problem. Generally, two types of electromagnetic interactions between particles can

be distinguished: near-ﬁeld coupling and far-ﬁeld dipolar interaction depending on the range of

interactions concerned. For particle separation r larger than the wavelength of light, the far-ﬁeld
dipolar interactions with a r−1 dependence dominate. Much work has focused on these far-ﬁeld in-

teractions between metal nanoparticles and their possible applications in optoelectronic materials.

However, relatively little is known about the nature and the properties of the near-ﬁeld interactions

of closely spaced metal nanoparticles, which is the object of the present work. The present work

is related to earlier studies of FDTD by Oliva and Gray,25 experiment and simulation by Su et

al.,26 the ﬁnite elements method by Kottmann and Martin,27 as well as the pioneering works of

the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) method by Hao and Schatza28, who all discovered that

the interparticle spacing in the particle dimers is crucial to their properties.

In this paper, we will use the multiple-image method29 and Bergman-Milton spectral

representation30,31 for a dimer of two approaching particles32 to investigate the optical extinc-

tion and reﬂectance spectrum of structured arrays of noble-metal nanoparticles, motivated by the

recent experimental observation of the splitting of the surface plasmon resonance bands for polar-

izations in the arrays.21,22 By taking into account the strong coupling of two approaching particles

in a dimer, we will show that the redshift as large as 1.5 eV into the near-infrared regime observed

in experiment22 can be understood. The resonant peak broadening and splitting for diﬀerent po-

larizations can be predicted from our calculations, and the results for the reﬂectance spectrum are

also presented.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

In the next section, we review the general

spectral representation of two approaching particles. In Sec. III, we examine the normal-incidence

extinction spectrum and reﬂectance spectrum of a silver dimer array immersed in a glass matrix,

which is followed by discussion and conclusion in Sec. IV

II. FORMALISM

First we review some formulae similar to those appeared in Ref. 32, however, in a much diﬀerent

context. Considering an isolated spherical metal particle in a lossless isotropic dielectric matrix

with real permittivity εm, the complex permittivity of the metal particle is ˜ε(ω), where ω is the
frequency of the external electric ﬁeld ~E0, and will be discussed in detail afterwards. In this case,

the dipole moment induced inside the particle is

where

is the dipole factor, which deﬁnes the polarizability of the particle against the host and is related

to extinction coeﬃcient directly, d is the diameter of the particle. To account for the multipolar

interaction between a pair of particles (i.e., a dimer) with spacing σ (center-to-center distance

r = σ + d), we use the multiple image formula.29 When the dimer is subjected to an unpolarized

ﬁeld, the average of the total dipole moment of one particle is given by

interaction is negligible. However, when the two particles approach to each other and ﬁnally touch,

the longitudinal (transverse) poles decrease (increase) far from 1/3. Thus, in this case, one should

take into account the eﬀect of multipolar interactions [see Fig. 5 in Ref. 32 for details].

The complex dielectric function ε(ω) is crucial to the optical properties of metal-dielectric

systems.1 For noble metals, it can generally be described by the free electron Drude-Lorentz-

Sommerfeld model plus an additive complex contribution from interband transition, i.e., ε(ω) =

1 + χDS(ω) + χIB(ω). A complicated function of the dielectric dispersion of Ag takes the form

Kronig relations. However, in the frequency range of interest (1

function εh = 5.45, static dielectric function εs = 6.18. These values were ﬁtted out to be in good

correspondence with the literature values.11,34 And the collision frequency γ in the material is

assumed to be related to the particle diameter d around 10 nm by35

For d = 10 nm, γ = 3.025

1014; for d = 5 nm, γ = 5.785

1014. These results show that the

×

×

mean free path of an electron in a nanoparticle is reduced compared to its bulk value due to

inelastic collisions with the particle surface. The γ values are taken in our latter calculations of

diﬀerent metal-dielectric systems, and compared to the two experimental samples, within which

the diameters of Ag nanoparticles were in the span of 5

15 nm.22,35 Note that γ determines the

linewidth of the resonant peak. In the diameter range under consideration, Eq. (11) is safe36 and

indicates that a smaller particle diameter d leads to a wider resonant peak. We are not intended to

quantitatively compare with the experimental data of Ref. 22, otherwise, we would be restricted

to a somewhat more rigid size-dependent dielectric function, for example, as Westcott et al.13

×

∼

Nevertheless, the local dielectric treatment is satisfactory as Hao and Schatz pointed out that the

signiﬁcant eﬀects of size-dependent dielectric responses come to appear for particles with diameter

less than 5 nm.28

Let us use ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) to denote the real and imaginary part of the dielectric function

obtained by Eq. (10), respectively, that is ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω). Fig. 1 shows ε1(ω) and ε2(ω)

versus light wavelength λ in the span of 250

1500 nm (i.e. photon energy around 0.8

5 eV). A

∼

negative ε1(ω) is guaranteed for the proper phase relation between the external ﬁeld and particle

polarization. The dielectric function changes slightly when the particle diameter decreases from

10 nm to 5 nm [not shown in Fig. 1], however, the resonant line shape is very sensitive to γ, i.e. the

∼

6

particle diameter [see Sec. III]. d

λ ensures that the plasma resonance is in quasi-static regime,

≪

so phase retardation is negligible, eﬀects of higher multipoles can also be neglected for isolated

spherical particle, which means that dipole plasmon resonance dominates.1

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

Now we consider an array of silver dimer immersed in a glass matrix of refractive index 1.61,

with the spacing between the two particles in a dimer being less than their diameter (σ 6 d). Any

two dimers are assumed to be far away enough, so the dimer-dimer interaction can simply be at far-

ﬁeld approximation, which is neglected in our calculation for simplicity. In the particle diameter

regime around 10 nm, dipole absorption contribution dominates the scattering eﬀect, although

dipole scattering increases and dipole absorption fades away for increasing particle sizes.1 So in

the quasi-static regime, the extinction coeﬃcient of a well-dispersed collection of small particles
is mainly contributed by absorption, with absorption cross section proportional to ωIm( ˜β).1,37

The complex value expressions of dipole factor in Eq. (2), Eq. (5) and Eq. (8) lead to diﬀerent
resonant peaks at diﬀerent frequencies. To calculate optical extinction, ˜β is taken for well-dispersed
(isolated) nanoparticles, while ˜βL ( ˜βT ) is adopted for an array of dimers.

Figure 2 shows the optical extinction spectra of an array of dimers with particle diameter

d = 5 nm, spacing σ is 0.5 nm and 1.5 nm, respectively. For comparison, solid curve is plotted for

the extinction spectrum of isolated silver particles. The surface plasmon resonant peak is located

around 410 nm (

3.0 eV), which is in agreement with the ﬁrst ion-exchanged sample irradiated by

∼

1 Mev Xe in Ref. 22. The sample contains randomly dispersed silver nanocrystals and the resonant

band is polarization independent. Long-dashed curves and medium-dashed curves in Fig. 2 are

the extinction spectra for the array of dimers with illumination light polarized in the longitudinal

and transverse direction, respectively. It is clear that the plasmon resonance band for longitudinal

polarization is redshifted with respect to that of isolated particles, whereas the plasmon resonance

band for transverse polarization is blueshifted. These were also observed in the experiment.22 In

detail, after the sample was subsequently irradiated by 30 Mev Si with ﬂuences up to 2

1014/cm2,

×

clear alignment of Ag nanocrystals was observed along the ion-beam direction. Additionally, farther

redshift and blueshift occur when decreasing the spacing of the two nanoparticles in a dimer from

7

1.5 nm to 0.5 nm [see Fig. 2]. That is, a stronger electromagnetic coupling induces further band

shifts.12

Similarly, an array of dimer with a larger particle diameter d = 10 nm are investigated in Fig. 3,

for diﬀerent spacing σ = 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 nm. Splitting of the resonant peak for both the

longitudinal and transverse polarized light can also be observed. However, a second resonant band

appears as the two particles in the dimer approach to each other. The second peak position is

around 830 nm (close to 1.5 eV) when spacing decreases to σ = 0.5 nm [see Fig. 3(a)], this is

in good agreement with the experimental observation of the second sample in Ref. 22. For this

sample, growing and more compact alignment of the silver nanocrystals are assumed to happen in

response to higher Si ion ﬂuences irradiation (up to 1

1015/cm2), and much higher irradiation

×

ﬂuences induces much larger splitting of the resonant band for both the longitudinal and transverse

polarizations. In fact, all of these are also obtained from Fig. 3. In principle, even in the quasi-static

regime, there are diﬀerent causes of multipeak behavior of optical spectra: (1) the splitting of the

dipole mode owing to nonspherical particle shapes, (2) the excitation of higher multipole modes

in irregularly shaped clusters as a result of inhomogeneous polarization (In this case, number of

resonances strongly increases when the section symmetry decreases), (3) the enhanced excitation

of multipoles due to image interactions for spheres. Multipeak structures can also be produced

by appropriate ε1(ω) spectra, and may be damped away if ε2(ω) is suﬃciently large. But as Fig.1

shows, the model dielectric function resulting from experiments of silver nanoparticles doesn’t

exhibit these behaviors, so we are conﬁdent that the multipeak behavior observed in the sample is

substantially due to the strongly coupling between the two particles in a dimer (i.e. (3)), because

no obvious identical irregular shape can be seen for the samples.22

The largest shift of resonant peak of the dimer array is shown for the longitudinal and transverse

ﬁeld cases in Fig. 4, at d = 10 nm. The ﬁgure shows the farthest shifting of the peak positions

versus spacing σ. The results are obtained by ﬁrst calculating the extinction spectra with diﬀerent

σ in the range of 0.5

20 nm, and then ﬁnding out the position of resonant peak at the longest

∼

(shortest) wavelength for the longitudinal (transverse) polarization. Large shifting is obvious only

when σ/d < 1, and this can also be understood from the spectral representation in the insert of

Fig. 5(b), which demonstrates that the spectral poles collapse to 1/3 when σ tends to be larger

than 10 nm. Within the spacing of σ < d, the redshift for the longitudinal polarization (diamond)

8

is obviously stronger than the blueshift for transverse polarization (circle). The large splitting is

due to both the dipole mode coupling (collective excitation mode) and the excitation of multipole

modes by image interactions.

We also note that the main resonant peak is narrower in Fig. 3 than that in Fig. 2, which

is mainly ascribed to the diﬀerent intrinsic damping eﬃcient concerning the particle diameter.

The narrowing of the resonant peak for increasing particle diameter was also observed in the

experiments.22 Note that no obvious peak shifting is observed in the experiments for isolated

particles after their growing.

It is instructive to investigate the optical extinction properties of the array of dimers for an

unpolarized light. We take the average of the longitudinal and transverse dipole factor, i.e. Eq. (8)

to obtain the extinction spectra. Results are shown in Fig. 5 for the two diﬀerent cases of particle

diameter d = 5 nm and 10 nm, respectively. Corresponding poles and residues of n = 1 to 10 in

the spectral representation are given in the inserts. It can be clearly seen that extinction spectra

still change when particles aggregate into structured array from a well-dispersed assemble, even

though the illumination light keeps unpolarized. This is due to the asymmetric coupling in diﬀerent

topology of the ﬁeld distribution inside and in the vicinity of the particles.12 Note that the shifting

tendency of plasmon-resonance band could be related to the pole deviating from 1/3. For speciﬁc

spacing, say, σ = 0.5 nm, the pole of n = 1 of the dimer with large particles [see insert in Fig. 5(b)]

is further away from 1/3 than that with small particles [see insert in Fig. 5(a)]. Equivalently,

there is a corresponding resonant peak appearing [Fig. 5(b)] at long wavelength regime for the

case of large particles (10 nm), whereas no obvious peak appearing [Fig. 5(a)] for the case of small

particles (5 nm). Theoretically, the discrete terms in the spectral representation should generate

a series of resonant bands, but they are generally very close and superpose to each other, so it is

hard to resolve them. In many cases the eﬀect is broadening of the resonance only, so the plasmon

modes remain spectrally unseparated.

For interest, we compare the reﬂectivity spectra for the diﬀerent cases. In the dilute limit, the

eﬀective dielectric function of the composite is given by38,39

˜εe = εm + 3εmp ˜β,

d = 10 nm respectively. Volume fraction p = 0.1 [see Fig. 6(a), (b) and Fig. 7(a), (b)] and p = 0.01

[see Fig. 6(c), (d) and Fig. 7(c), (d)] are taken in the calculations. We can see slight shift of the

reﬂectivity spectra for light with longitudinal and transverse polarization as compared to the case

of isolated particles [solid curves in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7]. Reﬂectance decreasing in low-frequency

regime is notable when spacing decreases [see Fig. 6(a), (c) and Fig. 7(a), (c)]. A large ﬂuctuation

in response to longitudinally polarized light is observed in the case of the larger particles with

a small spacing [long-dashed curves in Fig. 7]. Meanwhile, increasing the volume fraction of the

metal nanoparticles leads to the descending main peak of the reﬂectivity spectra. But note that

the order of the absolute value of reﬂectance is diﬀerent for the two diﬀerent volume fraction.

These are also ascribed to the very strong electromagnetic coupling between the nearby particles

and the strongly enhanced local ﬁeld.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Here a few comments on our results are in order. Firstly, the tail going up of the extinction

spectra in Ref. 22 is ascribed to the absorption of the matrix itself, see the reference measurement

for a Ag ion exchanged sample that was irradiated with Si only.

It does not show a plasmon

absorption band and is colorless, because there were no silver nanocrystals formed. We didn’t

take it into account in our calculation of the extinction spectrum. Furthermore, the experimental

spectra are broader than our results, this is due to particle size distribution and coupling of particles

in a chain through many-body interaction although we show that two-body interaction contributes

little when particles are far away with spacing larger than their diameter.

In the present work, we are concerned with the multipolar interaction between particles, i.e., we

focus mainly on the dimerization eﬀect. In doing so, we could neglect the non-local eﬀects in the

present classical treatment. It is believed that the signiﬁcant eﬀects of size-dependent dielectric

responses come to appear for particles with diameter less than 5 nm.28Although near adjacence

may enhance nonlocal contribution, our calculation results depend on the spacing-diameter ratio

σ/d, rather than the absolute value of σ. That is, the spacing in use is scaled by the particle size,

10

if regardless of the retardation eﬀect. So we also didn’t consider the suppression of the dielectric

conﬁnement due to quantum penetration eﬀects with very small interparticle gaps. We should

worry about retardation eﬀects when the particles size becomes large.

Due to strong coupling in the dimer, the enhanced excitation of multipoles of the electric ﬁeld

that occurs in the vicinity of the dimer appears, which is responsible for the excitation of spectrally

distinct higher order plasmon modes, such as the quadrupole plasmon-peak feature around 900nm.

Crosstalk between adjacent dimers is expected to have a negligible eﬀect on the optical spectra since

it takes place via far-ﬁeld scattering of the individual nanoparticles with a distance dependence of
r−1, whereas near-ﬁeld interactions of adjacent particles in each dimer show a r−3 dependence and

dominate at small distances, which is captured by our multiple image model.

Maier et al. used a coupled dipole model in a particle chain and predicted a value of 2 : 1 of the

ratio of peak shifts of the longitudinal collective modes to peak shifts of the transverse collective

modes, which is smaller than experiment value 2.3 : 1.21 We believe that if one takes into account

the multiple image interactions in the nanoparticle chain, the theoretically calculated value will

be increased. Work are under progress in this way.

We can take one step forward to include the nonlinear characteristics of noble metal particles.

For instance, based on Eq. (12), we could derive the eﬀective third-order nonlinear susceptibility

and then the nonlinear enhancement may be studied by taking into account multipolar interactions.

Regarding nonlinear enhancement due to dimerization, we can formulate some equations, based

on, say, Yuen and Yu.14 It is also interesting to apply the present theory to the polydisperse size

case, in which the two particles have diﬀerent diameters.

Figure Captions

Figure 1: Complex dielectric function of silver particles obtained from Eq. (10). Parameters:

d = 10 nm, others given in the context.

Figure 2: Extinction spectra for an array of dimer with particle diameter d = 5 nm, at two

diﬀerent spacing σ. The polarization of the incident light is longitudinal (long-dashed curve)

or transverse (medium-dashed curve) to the axis of the dimer. For reference, solid curve is the

extinction spectra of isolated and well-dispersed particle collection.

Figure 3: Splitting of the extinction spectra for an array of dimer with particle diameter

d = 10 nm, at four diﬀerent spacing σ. Others the same as in Fig. 2.

Figure 4: The resonant peak splitting for an dimer array of diameter d = 10 nm as the spacing

decreases from 20 nm to 0.5 nm. The lines are guides to the eye.

Figure 5: Unpolarized light extinction spectrum for an array of dimer with particle diameter

d = 10 nm and 5 nm respectively, at diﬀerent spacing σ. Inserts in each panel are the poles and

residues of the spectral representation.

Figure 6: Normal incidence reﬂectivity spectra for an array of dimer with particle diameter

d = 5 nm for diﬀerent spacing σ, taking volume fraction p = 0.1 [(a) and (b)] and p = 0.01 [(c)

and (d)] respectively.

d = 10 nm. Others the same as in Fig. 6.

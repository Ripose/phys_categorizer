Abstrat

A number of fators that in(cid:29)uene spetral position of the fem-

toseond pulse in a Kerr-lens modeloked Cr:LiSGaF laser have been

identi(cid:28)ed: high-order dispersion, gain saturation, reabsorption from

the ground state, and stimulated Raman sattering. Using the one-

dimensional numerial model for the simulation of the laser avity, the

relative ontributions of di(cid:27)erent fators have been ompared. The Ra-

man e(cid:27)et provides the largest self-frequeny shift from the gain peak

(up to 60 nm), followed by the gain saturation (∼ 25 nm), while the
high-order dispersion ontribution is insigni(cid:28)ant (∼ 5 nm). Compar-

ison with the experimental data on(cid:28)rm that the stimulated Raman

sattering is a main ause of the ultrashort pulse self-frequeny shift

observed in Cr:LiSGaF and Cr:LiSAF lasers.

1 Introdution

A rapid progress in Kerr-lens mode-loking tehnique allows to reah 14

and 12-fs pulse durations in Cr:LiSGaF and Cr:LiSAF lasers, respetively

[1, 2℄. These ative media are attrative due to possibilities of sub-20 fs

pulse generation diretly from the diode-pumped laser. At the same time,

the lasers demonstrate a signi(cid:28)ant Stokes shift of the pulse spetrum at suh

short pulsewidths [3, 4, 1℄. This shift dereases the aessible bandwidth

due to the worse overlap of the gain and the pulse spetra, thus setting a

limit to pulse duration [4℄. Therefore, investigation of the nature of the

ultrashort pulse spetrum transformation has not only aademi but also

pratial signi(cid:28)ane.

A number of explanations for the ultrashort pulse spetrum shift in mode-

loked lasers have been suggested. For example, it was supposed, that due to

the high-order dispersions the spetral region of negative group-delay disper-

sion, whih is optimal for pulse formation, may be displaed [5℄. However in

the framework of the perturbation theory the third-order dispersion does not

ontribute to the pulse arrier frequeny, but results in spetrum asymmetry

and fragmentation [6℄. Only in the ase of the non-steady-state operation

there is a possibility for the strong dynami frequeny shift [7℄.

A more realisti explanation of the frequeny shift takes into aount

frequeny (cid:28)ltering due to reabsorption in the gain medium [2℄. However, as

it will be shown below, this explanation an not explain the dependene of

the frequeny shift on the pulse energy. Moreover, suh dependene suggests

that a nonlinear mehanism is involved in the frequeny shift.

As it was shown in Ref.

[8℄, the stimulated Raman sattering in ative

medium is a very suitable nonlinear proess, whih an produe the experi-

mentally observed Stokes frequeny shift in sub-50 fs domain. The analysis

in Ref. [8℄ was based on the soliton perturbation theory that did not allow to

take into aount the e(cid:27)et of high-order dispersion and frequeny-dependent

dissipative lasing fators suh as asymmetri gain band, spetral (cid:28)ltering on

the output mirror, reabsorption in the gain medium and gain saturation.

In this work we performed a numerial analysis of the spetral hara-

teristis of ultrashort pulses on the basis of a relatively simple model of the

Kerr-lens mode loking (KLM). The main advantages of our model is tak-

ing into onsideration of the high-order dispersion, exat pro(cid:28)les of the loss

and gain bands, frequeny dependent reabsorption in the ative medium,

gain saturation and fast absorber ation of the Kerr-lensing. The obtained

results are in a good agreement with experimental data and allow to esti-

mate the ontribution of the di(cid:27)erent fators to spetral harateristis of

ultrashort pulses.

The paper is organized as follows: (cid:28)rst a summary of relevant measure-

ments and experimental results is given, followed by the onstrution of the

analytial and omputational models. We then present the results of our

2

alulations and disuss the in(cid:29)uene of eah of the abovementioned fa-

tors separately. Finally, we present the results of simulation with all fators

inluded, using distributed and disrete-element models.

2 Experimental observations

Systemati Stokes shift of the ultrashort modeloked pulse in Cr:LiSGaF-

and Cr:LiSAF-based KLM osillators has been (cid:28)rst reported in 1997 [1, 3, 9℄,

where the stimulated Raman sattering has been suggested as a possible

mehanism.

It has been found, that i) the shift ould be observed in os-

illators with di(cid:27)erent dispersion harateristis, ii) the shift inreases with

the pulse energy, and iii) the shift inreases with pulse shortening. At pulse

durations below 20 fs, the peak of the pulse spetrum may shift as far as

50-70 nm into the infrared as ompared to the w wavelength or modeloked

spetrum at long pulse durations (∼840 nm in Cr:LiSGaF) [1℄. Later, analo-

gous shifts in Cr:LiSAF have been reported by Uemura and Torizuka [2℄ and

R. Gäbel et al [10℄. All mentioned experiments used the ommon optial

sheme, di(cid:27)ering only in pump arrangements and dispersion ompensation

tehniques. The shemati diagram of the laser osillator is shown in Fig. 1.

This is a representative sheme for any X-shaped KLM laser, beause di(cid:27)er-

ent types of dispersion ompensation an always be represented by lumped

dispersion of a hirped mirror. For modeling purposes we used the parame-

ters of experiments, reported in Refs. [1, 9℄: the Brewster-angled 4 mm long

LiSGaF rystal doped with 1.4% Cr, beam diameter in Cr:LiSGaF rystal

40×60 µm. The high re(cid:29)etors (HR) had negligible dispersion. The dis-

persion of the hirped mirrors (CM) has been alulated from its original

design, and additionally measured by white-light interferometry. The intra-

avity dispersion was alulated using the dispersion data of Cr:LiSGaF [3℄,

measured dispersion urves of the hirped mirrors and alulated dispersion

of the output oupler (Fig. 2). We also used the experimental loss spetra

(mirror transmission and ground-state absorption in Cr:LiSGaF) as shown

in Fig. 3.

+

The laser was pumped by 1.2-1.5 W from a Kr

-ion laser at 647 nm,

with a TEM00 beam, of whih 0.9-1.1 W have been absorbed in the ative

medium, generating 60-100 mW of average output power in the modeloked

regime. The resonator was slightly asymmetri, with distanes between the

urved mirrors (radii of urvature 100 mm) and end mirrors being 88 and

109 m, orresponding to 72 MHz pulse repetition rate. Modeloking has

been ahieved primarily by the hard aperture in form of an adjustable slit

lose to the output oupler (Fig. 1). Fig. 4 shows normalized output spetra

at di(cid:27)erent pulse peak power, demonstrating the spetral shift. Similar spe-

tral behaviour has been observed also in Cr:LiSAF osillators. However, for

the sake of simpliity we provide experimental data and perform simulations

3

on Cr:LiSGaF only.

The Raman gain spetrum of undoped LiSGaF rystal has been mea-

sured aording to the proedure desribed in Ref. [9℄, using the orientated

rystalline quartz as a referene, and taking into aount the thermal phonon

population fator. The spetrum (see Fig. 5) is obtained from spontaneous

Raman sattering spetrum, reordered in onfoal bak-sattering geome-

try. Both inident and sattered light is polarized along the c axis, orre-

sponding to the polarization of light in the laser. LiSGaF possesses spatial

symmetry group D

3d (P¯31) with 2 formula units in a unit ell, resulting in
2
total of 32 optial phonon modes 3A1g + 4A2g + 4A1u + 5A2u + 8Eg + 8Eu , of
whih 3A1g +8Eg are Raman-ative. In the sattering geometry as desribed
above, only 3 full-symmetri A1g modes are visible (Fig. 5), with relevant

parameters given in Table 1.

3 Model

There exist di(cid:27)erent approahes to modeling of ultrashort pulse generation

in solid-state laser, whih are based on soliton or (cid:29)utuation models. The

soliton approah an be applied only the distributed laser model (where the

dispersion and nonlinearity are implied to be evenly distributed over the

round-trip and at simultaneously) but allows to build omparatively simple

analytial desription thus promoting easy interpretation of results. We also

based our alulations on the distributed laser model but the results were

tested by simulations on the basis of disrete-element sheme orresponding

to Fig. 1. To overome the limitations of the soliton approah we used

numerial simulations allowing to aount for the high-order dispersion, the

laser (cid:28)eld reabsorption, the ompliated spetral pro(cid:28)les of the gain and

output oupler transmission, and the Raman sattering within the ative

medium.

The modeloking is desribed by a fast absorber-like ation of Kerr-

lensing in the ative medium in the form of a nonlinear transmission-operator

i

has

hanging the avity on(cid:28)guration, whih is a ommon proedure for Kerr-lens

mode-loking experiment.

Another fundamental fator in our model is the presene of high-order

dispersions due to the ative medium, the dispersion ompensator, the out-

put oupler, and high-re(cid:29)etive mirrors. The orresponding experimental

harateristis are shown in Fig. 2. For the numerial alulations, the data

were represented by the eighth-order polynomial approximation. The ation

of dispersion an thus be presented in the following form:

where ω is the frequeny, G(t − t′) is the Green's funtion depending on the
dispersion oe(cid:30)ients Dj up to eighth order of j .

The next important fator in our model is the gain saturation that was

desribed on the basis of quasi-two level sheme of the ative medium oper-

ation [12℄:

where Ip is the pump intensity, ν is the pump frequeny, σ14 and σ32 are
the loss and the gain ross-setions, respetively, Tr = 85 µs is the gain

relaxation time. If the pulse duration is muh less then avity round-trip

where P = (Ipσ14/hν)Tcav is the dimensionless pump intensity, z is the

dimensionless longitudinal oordinate, i. e. the number of the avity round-

trips. Es = hν/σ32 is the gain saturation energy (cid:29)ux, E is the full pulse

energy (cid:29)ux.

Self-phase modulation in the ative medium was represented by non-

, where β = 2πn2x/λn =
linear (cid:16)transmission(cid:17) operator exp
3.4 cm2/TW is the self-phase modulation oe(cid:30)ient. Here n and n2 are the
linear and nonlinear oe(cid:30)ients of refration, respetively, λ is the entral
wavelength orresponding in our ase to the gain band maximum, x = 8 mm

h

i

−iβ |a(z, t)|2

is twie the length of the ative rystal.

Finally, we onsider the stimulated Raman sattering within the ative

medium. Following Ref. [8℄, where Raman sattering ontribution was al-

ulated analytially on the basis of the soliton model, we supplement the

model with the following equations:

(5a)

(5b)

(5)

where ς is the longitudinal oordinate (pulse propagation axis) inside the
ative medium, ap,s are the amplitudes of the (cid:16)pump(cid:17) and the (cid:16)Stokes(cid:17)
omponents within generation spetrum, Ωj are the phonon resonane fre-
quenies (j = 1, 2, 3 orresponding to the three Raman-ative phonon res-
onanes in LiSGaF, see Fig. 5). Tj are the inverse bandwidths of Raman
lines, µj =gs
j Ωj/Tj are the oupling parameters for Raman gain oe(cid:30)ients
gs
j .

Solving third equation of the system, we obtain the steady-state phonon

amplitude for the (cid:28)xed pump and the Stokes omponents with orresponding

frequenies ωp and ωs :

Qj =

Tj

. (6)

The validity of the last approximate expression follows from the fat that

the Raman lines are narrow in omparison with the pulse spetrum. With

regard to the ontribution of all spetral omponents of the pulse to the

phonon amplitude, the equation for the Stokes and the pump (cid:28)elds in the

frequeny domain an be written as:

where k is the index of the (cid:28)eld's spetral (i.e. Fourier) omponent (in the
simulations we onsidered 213
row, the (cid:28)eld variation within these lines is negligible, i.e. as,p are onstant

omponents). Sine the Raman lines are nar-

and an be taken out of the seond summation. Then the summation an

be exeuted expliitly by transition to the integral, resulting in

It should be noted, that in these equations ωp − ωs = Ωj and there is

the pair-wise interation of the spetral omponents within the wide enough

generation spetrum.

There are two main mehanisms of the generation of the initial seed at

the Stokes frequeny for Eqs. (8). The (cid:28)rst one is the spontaneous Raman

sattering with the inrements of the sattered intensity growth

h

where ns is the index of refration at Stokes frequeny, T is the tempera-
ture, and kB is the Boltzmann's onstant [13℄. With this seed signal, the

stimulated Raman sattering results in appearane and growth of spetral

replias of the main osillation pulse, shifted to the lower frequenies by the

Raman frequenies Ωj .

More signi(cid:28)ant soure for Stokes omponent's ampli(cid:28)ation, however,

is the broad-band pulse (cid:28)eld itself. When the pulse pulse spetrum is wide

enough to beome omparable with the Raman frequeny shift, the lower-

frequeny part of the spetrum an play a role of the Stokes omponent seed

with respet to the higher-frequeny part of the spetrum. The stimulated

Raman sattering then transfers the energy form the higher-frequeny om-

ponents to the lower-frequeny ones, resulting in the ontinuous red-shift of

the pulse spetrum as a whole. As the (cid:28)eld amplitude of the laser pulse

signi(cid:28)antly exeeds the spontaneous seed, the seond mehanism strongly

dominates over the (cid:28)rst one. However, we inluded both mehanisms in our

model, beause their in(cid:29)uene on the pulse spetrum is quite di(cid:27)erent.

Later on it is onvenient to normalize the time to the inverse gain band-

width tg = 2.25 fs and the intensity to β−1
of the (cid:28)eld energy to (βtg)−1

, resulting in the normalization

. As already pointed out, we analyzed the

desribed above model in two ways: on the basis of distributed and disrete-

element approahes. In the framework of the distributed model, we didn't

onsider the propagation through the individual laser element and supposed

that the pulse envelope is formed by the overall net-dispersion in the avity.

As result we have a split-step sheme desribing ultrashort pulse propagation

from z to z + 1 transits:

The system (10) has to be ompleted by the system (8) and the result

following the laser sheme in Fig. 1. The nonlinear and spetral harateris-

tis of eah laser element are onsidered separately. Further re(cid:28)nement of the

simulation is ahieved by onsidering the pulse propagation through ative

medium by splitting it into (cid:28)ve slies and applying the split-step proedure

to eah slie onseutively.

4 Disussion

Our simulations are aimed at investigation of the in(cid:29)uene of the di(cid:27)erent

fators on spetral harateristis of the ultrashort pulses. Therefore, to sim-

plify the interpretation, we will (cid:28)rst onsider the high-order dispersion ation

without Raman sattering and without reabsorption; then reabsorption and

Raman sattering will be taken into onsideration without high-order dis-

persion ation; and (cid:28)nally, the join ation of all fators will be analyzed.

To onlude, we will also ompare the obtained results with the alulation

based on the disreet-element model.

4.1 High-order dispersion ation

As it was disussed in [6℄, small ontribution of third-order dispersion to

harateristis of Shrödinger soliton does not ause the frequeny shift, but

introdues additional (cid:28)eld time delay on the avity round-trip. However,

the in(cid:29)uene of the linear and nonlinear dissipative terms in Eqs. (10) an

destroy the soliton harater of the pulse, in partiular, it an add the hirp.

The latter, as it was shown in [7℄, results in the frequeny shift of the pulse

spetrum in the non-steady-state regime. Additionally, in the real-world

laser systems the ontribution of the high-order dispersions, as a rule, lies

beyond the bounds of the perturbation theory validity.

The typial net-dispersion urves orresponding to the experiment with

the hirped mirrors are presented in Fig. 6, a. Over the full spetral region of

generation the pulse undergoes the non-negligible in(cid:29)uene of the dispersion

up to the eighth-order (see Eq. (2)). As a rule, there is the losed spetral

window of dispersion, whih is (cid:16)optimal(cid:17) for steady-state pulse generation.

The ontribution of the high-order dispersion terms an shift this window. In

Fig. 6, a, this shift orresponds to the red-shift of the positive net-dispersion

branhes (transition from solid to dash and dot urves). The resulting output

spetra obtained from the distributed model are shown in Fig. 6, b. The

net-dispersion shift is aompanied by the red-shift of the pulse spetrum

(transition from solid to dash and dot urves). Besides this e(cid:27)et there is

the possibility of the essential spetral pro(cid:28)le distortion (solid urve) and

side-band generation (side-bands lie outside the of shown region) [4℄.

However, we annot onsider this shift as the ause of the experimentally

observed e(cid:27)et beause the dispersion shift has the linear nature, i. e. there

is no obvious dependene of this shift on the (cid:28)eld energy. This is demon-

strated by Fig. 7, where the pulse energy variation due to the pump variation

hanges the spetral pro(cid:28)le, but does not ause any notieable frequeny shift

(ompare solid and dash urves in this (cid:28)gure).

The obtained results demonstrate that the self-frequeny shift annot be

aused by the non-dissipative fators. As the pulse duration is too large for

the nonlinear dispersion to play any signi(cid:28)ant role, we will onentrate on

9

spetrally-dependent losses and Raman e(cid:27)et.

4.2 Output loss and reabsorption in gain medium

As mentioned above, dependene of the frequeny shift on pulse energy im-

plies the involvement of some nonlinear mehanism. Sine in the real-world

systems the gain band does not oinide with (cid:28)ltering band (output mirror

in our ase) and the reabsorption band, the spetral position of the net-gain

maximum hanges with the gain value. The latter is de(cid:28)ned by the pump

and by the pulse energy (see Eqs. (10)): pulses with higher energy experi-

ene lower gain due to the multi-pass saturation. The dependene of the

net-gain maximum on the saturated steady-state gain oe(cid:30)ient α is shown

in Fig. 8 by the solid urve. This urve was obtained from the numerial

analysis of the measured spetrum of the output oupler, intraavity loss and

gain pro(cid:28)les. As we an see from this (cid:28)gure, the behavior of the net-gain

maximum orresponds to the Stokes frequeny shift with the pulse energy

growth, due to the gain oe(cid:30)ient derease. However, the magnitude of this

shift (∼ 10 nm) is not su(cid:30)ient to explain the experimental values (up to

50 nm). Besides that, the loation of the pulse spetrum in general does not

oinide with the net-gain maximum.

To hek the last thesis we performed numerial simulations on the basis

of the desribed above model in the presene of dissipative fators only. The

results are presented in Fig. 8 by the dashed lines ABCD and EF GH . The

letters alongside of squares, irles and triangles denote the intraavity pulse

energy obtained from the numerial simulation (see Table 3). The pulse

energy variation results from the hange of modulation parameter σ , i.e.

due to the hange of the avity on(cid:28)guration.

The urve ABCD illustrates the ase when there is no reabsorption and

Raman sattering in the ative medium. The dependene of frequeny shift

on pulse energy is not monotonous: at the minimum pulse width (15 fs in our

ase) there is no Stokes frequeny shift, ontraditing the experimental data.

Moreover, the maximal shift (of about 6 nm) is by an order of magnitude less

than that observed in the experiment. It is lear, that gain band asymmetry

and output loss alone annot produe large self-frequeny shift in Cr:LiSGaF

laser.

Stronger ontribution is provided by the reabsorption in the ative medium

(urve EF GH on Fig. 8). For small energies the simulation result (point E

on Fig. 8) oinides with the predition made on the basis of elementary

model of net-gain maximum shift (solid urve). The rise of the pulse energy

inreases the shift (up to 25 nm in our ase), muh more than in the previous

ase, although still by a fator of two less than in the experiment.

Note, that after ertain pulse energy the spetral shift is again dereasing.

This is aused by the inrease of the pulse duration for the large energies

(point H on Fig. 8), due to the nonlinear loss saturation, resulting in redued

10

spetrum width. The laser approahes the ondition of the w operation,

desribed by solid urve (although the onditions of pulsed gain saturation

strongly di(cid:27)er from those in w-regime).

4.3 Raman sattering

As pointed out in the previous setion, the net-gain shift model fails to pro-

vide orret desription of the experimental data by a fator of two. However,

taking the stimulated Raman sattering into aount allows to obtain large

frequeny shifts, inreasing with pulse energy growth. In Fig. 8 the urve

IJK demonstrates the Raman sattering ation in the absene of reabsorp-

tion e(cid:27)et. As the simulation demonstrates, the red omponents originate

from the ampli(cid:28)ed Raman signal, whih pulls the whole spetrum over the

long wavelength limit at the given pump power, de(cid:28)ned by the spetral (cid:28)l-

tering.

Note the pronouned threshold-like harater of the e(cid:27)et. For the small

energies (point I ) the spetral shift is negligible, but the energy growth auses

very strong shift (60 nm in our ase) in good agreement with experimental

results [1, 3, 4℄ and with analytial predition [8℄. Sine the gain saturation

does not play important role in this ase, the dependene of frequeny shift

on gain oe(cid:30)ient is insigni(cid:28)ant.

As already mentioned above, the main ontribution to the stimulated

Raman proess omes from the energy transfer from the blue part of the

pulse spetrum (pump) to the red one (Stokes). The e(cid:30)ieny of the stim-

ulated Raman sattering is therefore de(cid:28)ned by the produt of intensities

at pump and Stokes frequenies. The separation between Stokes and pump

omponents is (cid:28)xed, it is equal to the Raman line frequeny Ωj . There-

fore, dereasing the pulse spetrum width strongly suppresses the e(cid:27)et and

redues self-frequeny shift. Assuming that the pulse spetrum has expo-

nential fall-o(cid:27) to the blue and red sides, we see that the dependene of the

Raman shift on the pulse spetrum width should be asymptotially exponen-

tial at long pulse durations. This is also the result of the analytial theory

in Ref [8℄, where seh

pulse shape has been assumed.

2

As the Raman e(cid:27)et strongly depends on the pulse intensity and Raman

gain, it should be espeially pronouned in low-gain lasers working with

low output oupling and high intraavity pulse energy, suh as Cr:LiSGaF,

Cr:LiSAF, Cr:YAG. These materials also possess strong and broad Raman

lines [9℄. Large power-dependent red-shift in Cr:LiSGaF and Cr:LiSAF is

well doumented [1, 2, 3℄. In femtoseond Cr:YAG lasers, femtoseond pulse

spetrum is also always red-shifted with respet to the w wavelength in the

same resonator [14℄.

11

4.4 Disrete-element model

Finally, we an ompare the simulation results in ase of distributed and

disrete-element models. In the ase of the high-order dispersion ation the

transition to the distributed-element model does not signi(cid:28)antly hange

the spetral harateristis of the pulse (the dot urve in Fig. 6, b ). The

long-wavelength (cid:16)shoulder(cid:17) of the spetrum in the ase of the net dispersion

orresponding to solid urve in Fig. 6 a is somewhat stronger than in the dis-

tributed model. This is beause this (cid:16)shoulder(cid:17) results from loal dispersion

maximum due to the hirped mirror (CM1 on Fig. 1), whih is the losest to

the output mirror. Additionally, the self-phase modulation ontribution is

found to be slightly higher in omparison to the distributed model. However,

all these hanges are not qualitative. We found also that the transformation

of the spetrum on eah laser elements is small ensuring the validity of the

distributed model.

It should also be noted, that the transition from the

distributed to the disrete model slightly inreases the ontribution of the

Raman sattering, seen by the lower threshold energy.

5 Conlusion

Using the numerial simulations performed in the framework of one-dimensional

distributed and disrete-element models, we analysed the spetral harater-

istis of a w Kerr-lens mode-loked Cr: LiSGaF-laser. The two main fa-

tors ausing the ultrashort pulse self-frequeny shift have been established:

the nonlinear shift of the net-gain band due to the gain saturation in the

presene of reabsorption in the ative medium and the stimulated Raman

sattering. The (cid:28)rst e(cid:27)et is essential for omparatively small pulse ener-

gies and produes wavelength shifts up to 30 nm. The Raman sattering

ours as a result of pulse energy growth and auses the large (over 50 nm)

red shift. The ontribution of the high-order dispersion (up to the eighth

order), gain-band asymmetry and spetral harateristis of output oupler

were estimated as well. However, their e(cid:27)et on the pulse entral frequeny

is muh smaller than that of the stimulated Raman sattering, whih is the

main ause of spetral red-shift in Kerr-lens modeloked laser. The shift

values obtained from the numerial simulations are in good agreement with

experimental data.

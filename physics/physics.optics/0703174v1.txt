We report the observation of strong exciton-photon coupling in a ZnSe based microcavity fab-
ricated using epitaxial liftoﬀ. Molecular beam epitaxial grown ZnSe/Zn0.9Cd0.1Se quantum wells
with a one wavelength optical length at the exciton emission were transferred to a SiO2/Ta2O5
mirror with a reﬂectance of 96% to form ﬁnesse matched microcavities. Analysis of our angle re-
solved transmission spectra reveals key features of the strong coupling regime: anticrossing with a
normal mode splitting of 23.6meV at 20K; composite evolution of the lower and upper polaritons;
and narrowing of the lower polariton linewidth near resonance. The heavy hole exciton oscillator
strength per quantum well is also deduced to be 1.78 × 1013cm−2.

Light-matter interaction inside quantum microcavities
(MC) containing one or more quantum wells has seen
growing interest since the ﬁrst experimental observation
of the normal mode splitting of the coupled oscillators.1
The two coupled states, the lower and upper cavity-
polaritons, are the result of the strong hybridization
of the resonant cavity photon and quantum well exci-
ton. The cavity-polariton lends itself to the possibil-
ity of a threshold-less laser,2,3,4 ultrafast micro-optical
ampliﬁers,5,6 and Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) in
a solid state environment.7

Much of the work done in this area has focused on
III-V MCs1,5,6,8 because of the high quality quantum
wells and GaAs/AlAs distributed Bragg reﬂectors. How-
ever, the low binding energy of excitons found in typi-
cal III-V QWs (5 − 10meV ) is not ideal. Saba et. al.6
show that the cut-oﬀ temperature for polariton paramet-
ric scattering, the proposed mechanism for a threshold-
less laser, is determined by the exciton binding energy,
and therefore room temperature operation is prohibited.
Achieving BEC in MCs also requires suﬃciently large
binding energies such that the critical density can be
reached before ionization. Wide bandgap II-VI based
MCs are a promising alternative since the typical bind-
ing energy (∼ 30meV ) is comparable to the room tem-
perature thermal energy.9 Fabrication of II-VI MCs is a
challenge with all growth techniques since suitable mate-
rials that satisfy the lattice matching criteria are in their
infancy. To the best of our knowledge there are only a
few demonstrations of II-VI based MCs, either involving
growth-etch-growth processing10,11 or the use of semi-
conductor mirrors.3,7,12,13 Large light penetration depth
due to the low refractive index contrast and diﬃculties
of strain management are inherent disadvantages of the
latter approach.

We report here the successful fabrication and charac-
terisation of ZnSe based MCs using a selective etching
technique.14 This new technology has allowed us to fab-
ricate high quality ZnSe based MCs with dielectric mir-
rors. The large binding energies found in ZnSe based
QWs combined with the high performance of dielectric
mirrors makes our samples ideally suited to the study of
parametric scattering and BEC.

on high quality GaAs n+−substrates following deposi-
tion of a 20nm ZnSe buﬀer layer. A sacriﬁcial layer
of MgS (10nm) was grown15, then the active region,
5 ZnSe(8nm)/Zn0.9Cd0.1Se(8nm) quantum wells with
ZnSe spacers (∼ 53nm) top and bottom such that the
thickness of the active layer was equal to one opti-
cal wavelength at the emission of the well. Rotation
of the sample was stopped during the growth of the
top ZnSe spacer so as to allow translational tuning of
∼ 10meV mm−1 of the completed MC. Small 3 × 3mm
samples from the wafer were prepared by cleaving and
coated with wax. The MgS sacriﬁcial layer was selectively
etched in a solution of HCl acid to free the active layer
from the GaAs substrate. The lifted layer, supported by
the layer of wax, was then transferred to a SiO2/Ta2O5
dielectric mirror. Details of the liftoﬀ technique are
reported elsewhere.14 Our mirrors are speciﬁcally de-
signed such that the cavity linewidth, γcav and electric
ﬁeld proﬁle were optimum for strong coupling with our
quantum wells.16 The mirror transmission was measured
to be 3.9% at 475nm with a structure designated by
g(LH)7La (L : SiO2, n = 1.46, H : T a2O5, n = 2.1

and a : air, n = 1.0). Finally a second dielectric mirror
was mechanically held against the active layer forming a
MC of cavity length Lcav ∼ 170nm17 and refractive in-
dex ncav = 2.78. The completed MCs were transferred to
a continuous ﬂow cryostat and characterized at 20K. All
our fabrication steps were carried out in an air ﬁltered
environment, reducing the possibility of dust particles
becoming trapped within the MC.

Reference samples were lifted and transferred to fused
silica substrates and characterised by measuring their
transmission at 77K. White-light continuum generated
with f s pulses from a Ti:Saphire laser was focused to
a spot size of 20µm on the sample. The sample was
normal to the optical axis. The transmitted light was
collected with an angular resolution of 0.2◦ at normal
incidence by a 500µm multi-mode ﬁbre bundle. The col-
lected light was dispersed with a spectrometer with a
resolution of 0.1nm and imaged onto a liquid nitrogen
cooled CCD camera. Figure 1 shows the transmission of 5
ZnSe/Zn0.9Cd0.1Se quantum wells lifted and transferred
to a fused silica substrate. Two main optical features are
the heavy-hole exciton Xhh = 2.575eV and light-hole ex-
citon Xlh = 2.611eV transitions. A low energy oscillation
is clear and is attributed to interference within the over-
all epitaxial layer. High energy features around 2.77eV
correspond to bulk transitions in the ZnSe barriers.

the objective lens, white light was focused at the sam-
ple and the transmitted light was collimated to a di-
ameter of 33mm, where a ﬁbred coupled spectrometer
was used to scan through the collimated light and thus
record a series of transmission spectra. In this way lat-
eral displacement is related to angular dispersion inside
the MC. Taking into account the glass substrate of the
mirrors the range of angle at the MC surface was ±6◦.
Each spectrum was taken at diﬀerent points through the
centre of the collimated beam with increments of 1mm.
Since the in-plane wavevector inside the cavity, k|| is re-
lated to the angle of incident light by k|| = ωcav
c sin(θ)
we can measure the dispersion curves of our samples in
k-space between ±1.39 × 106m−1. Figure 2 shows a se-
ries of spectra taken for one of our samples detuned to
δ = −4.1meV relative to the Xhh transition at normal in-
cidence. The spectra are oﬀset with the lowest spectrum
corresponding to k|| = −1.39 × 106m−1 (−6◦) increasing
to k|| = 1.39 × 106m−1 (+6◦). The uncoupled Xhh and
Xlh transition are indicated by the dotted lines. Two op-
tical features clearly anticross on either side of the Xhh
transition, the lower (LP) and upper polariton (UP), a
clear demonstration of strong coupling.

FIG. 2: Angle resolved transmission spectra taken at spatial
points in the ﬁrst Fourier plane of the collection lens. The
sample was detuned by −4.1meV at θ = 0◦ and scanned
through ±6◦. The dashed lines mark the uncoupled heavy
hole, Xhh and light hole exciton, Xlh transitions. The nor-
mal incidence spectrum is highlighted. Spectra are oﬀset for
clarity.

The deﬁnitive experiment when searching for cavity-
polaritons is the measurement of the optical angular dis-
persion. In the weak coupling regime the two states dis-
perse independently. In the strong coupling regime the
observed dispersion curves are distinctly altered on and
near resonance, where they anticross with a normal mode
splitting (Rabi splitting), typically a few meV .

Completed microcavities were characterised by mea-
suring white light transmission at 20K. Two identical
lenses, NA matched to the cryostat, were used to fo-
cus and collect light at the sample. Fully illuminating

Figure 3(a) shows the resonant transmission spectrum
for the same detuning as ﬁgure 2. At this point on the
dispersion curve, k|| = 6.48 × 105m−1 (2.8◦), the com-
posite states are in resonance and the energy separation
between the two modes is a minimum. The peak energy
values for the LP and UP are extracted from ﬁgure 2 and
presented in ﬁgure 3(b) (open circles) as a function of k||.

oscillators the eigenvalues of the coupling Hamiltonian
were used to calculate the energy dispersion of the LP
and UP taking the Rabi splitting, ¯hΩ as ﬁt parameter.18
The coupled and bare states are displayed as dotted and
dashed lines respectively and give good agreement with
the experimental data. The point of resonance is found
to occur at ±2.8◦ with ¯hΩ = 23.6meV . The heavy
hole exciton oscillator strength, fXhh can be determined
from the expression,18 fXhh = (¯hΩ)
, where the
number of quantum wells, Nqw, the cavity refractive in-
dex, nc and eﬀective cavity length, Le are 5, 2.78 and
571nm respectively. mo is the free electron mass. For our
microcavity we deduce an oscillator strength per quan-
tum well, fXhh = 1.78 × 1013cm−2. This is similiar to
fXhh ∼ 1×1013cm−2 for MCs studied by Kelkar et. al..10
The polariton state transmission amplitude is a mea-
sure of the polariton composite ratio.19 In Figure 3(c) we
present the normalized integrated intensities, ILP,UP (k||)
of the LP and UP branch giving a proportional indica-
tion of the evolution of the photonic fraction of the po-
Ilp,up(k||)
lariton. We have deﬁned ILP,UP (k||) =
Ilp(k||)+Iup(k||)
such that ILP (k||) + IUP (k||) = 1. In the angular range
of −4◦ ≤ 0 ≤ +4◦ the LP is predominantly photon-like,
indicated by the increase in the LP intensity. Beyond
this range the LP weakens as it becomes progressively
more excitonic and ELP (k||) → EXhh . The UP behaves
inversely. We also note that on resonance, ﬁgure 3(a),
Ilp(k||) = 2.6 × Iup(k||). Ilp(k||) = Ilp(k||) holds at larger
k|| beyond resonance. This is also the case in the MC

studied by Kelkar et. al..10 The measured linewidths,
ΓLP,UP (k||) of the LP and UP are presented in ﬁgure
3 (d). Narrowing of the LP linewidth is clearly evident
and occurs at ∼ k|| = ±1 × 106m−1 (∼ ±3◦).20 This is
evidence that the extended nature of the polariton aver-
ages out some of the inhomogeneous broadening in the
quantum well exciton.

In conclusion, we have shown that high quality ZnSe
based MCs can be fabricated with the use of an epitax-
ial liftoﬀ technique.14 We have successfully demonstrated
three key features of the strong coupling regime: an-
ticrossing of the cavity polariton with a normal mode
splitting of 23.6meV ; composite fractional evolution of
the LP and UP; and narrowing of the LP linewidth near
resonance. We also deduce the heavy hole exciton os-
cillator strength to be fXhh = 1.78 × 1013cm−2. Our
fabrication technique has eliminated the need for com-
plicated growth-etch-growth processing whilst still em-
ploying the advantages of large exciton binding energies
found in wide bandgap II-VI materials and high reﬂec-
tivity oﬀered by dielectric mirrors. Additionally, the epi-
taxial liftoﬀ technology can potentially be developed to
fabricate MCs with MgS/ZnSe quantum wells with an
even higher exciton binding energies, ∼ 40meV .21 The
combination of prolonged photonic lifetimes, due to the
achievable high ﬁnesse, and the large excitonic oscillator
strength are ideally suited to nonlinear phenomena such
as parametric scattering and BEC.

Energy focusing inside a dynamical cavity

We study the exact classical solutions for a real scalar ﬁeld inside a cavity with a wall whose
motion is self-consistently determined by the pressure of the ﬁeld itself. We ﬁnd that, regardless of
the system parameters, the long-time solution always becomes nonadiabatic and the ﬁeld’s energy
concentrates into narrow peaks, which we explain by means of a simple mechanical system. We
point out implications for the quantized theory.

The dynamics of conﬁned cavity ﬁelds interacting with
the cavity wall is of great interest for the understand-
ing of a variety of problems such as hadron bag models
[1], sonoluminescence [2], cavity QED [3] and black hole
radiations [4]. Previous works have mostly approached
the problem assuming an externally imposed wall mo-
tion, neglecting the eﬀects of the radiation pressure, or
used the adiabatic approximation [5,6]. In this paper we
study, without any approximation, the dynamics of a real
scalar ﬁeld inside a cavity, the wall of which moves ac-
cording to the combined force of a static potential V (R)
and the ﬁeld pressure. This system bears important re-
semblances to more complicated ones, such as the Dirac
and electromagnetic ﬁelds, since they can be partially or
completely cast in the form of a wave equation. Moreover
the classical solutions should be a good approximation to
the quantized ﬁelds at least in the case of a large number
of ﬁeld quanta. As initial condition for the ﬁeld we al-
ways consider a normal mode of the static cavity. This is
in fact a common situation in the study of many physical
systems.

We ﬁnd that in general the system evolves nonadia-
batically, and the ﬁeld energy concentrates into narrow
peaks. This phenomenon can be understood with the
help of a simple classical mechanical system.

In the present work we use natural units and hence the
action S is dimensionless as are the velocities. This sim-
ply means that, although we are dealing with a classical
system, for convenience the action is taken in units of ¯h.
In one space dimension and with the ﬁeld only inside the
cavity, the system is deﬁned by the action

Notice the dependence on ˙R of the boundary condi-
tions. If φ(R) = 0 is imposed, the total energy, which
is conserved for a static cavity, is no longer constant for
˙R 6= 0. Eq. 3 is satisﬁed by φ(x, t) with
φ(x, t) = G(t − x) + G(t + x)

(5)

and the positive sign between the two G’s ensures that
the ﬁrst boundary condition of Eqs. 4 is met. Substitut-
ing Eq. 5 in the second of Eqs. 4 we obtain:

G′(t + R(t)) =

1 − ˙R(t)
1 + ˙R(t)

G′ (t − R(t))

.

(6)

For prescribed wall motion, G(z) for any z can be
found by using Eq. 6 and the null line method [5].
It
is assumed that the cavity is static for t ≤ t0 with a
length R(t0). This is equivalent to saying that there is
a static zone z ≤ z0 = t0 + R(t0), in which G(z) is an-
alytically known. One can ﬁnd the values of G(z > z0)
outside the static zone by ﬁrst solving the algebraic
equation z = teqv + R(teqv) for teqv and then ﬁnding
z− ≡ teqv − R(teqv). This process, which is equivalent
to constructing a null line connecting the points z and
z−, can be repeated many times until a point zs in the
static zone is reached. The values of G(z) and G(zs) are
related through Eq. 6. However in the case under study,
we do not have, in general, a static zone, and we need to
verify that knowing the initial conditions of the system
is enough to implement the above method.

We will show that in order to ﬁnd φ(x, t + dt) with
0 ≤ x ≤ R(t + dt), it is necessary and suﬃcient to know
G(z) and G′(z) for t − R(t) ≤ z ≤ t + R(t) and R(t′) for
t ≤ t′ ≤ t + dt. That is just what is required in order to
have a unique solution of the system of two second order
equations (2) and (3).

Since φ(x, t + dt) = G(t + dt − x) + G(t + dt + x),
we need to ﬁnd G(z) and G′(z) for t + dt − R(t + dt) ≤
z ≤ t + dt + R(t + dt). Now we have two cases: either
z ≤ t + R(t) or z > t + R(t).

In the ﬁrst case it is also true that

z ≥ t + dt − R(t + dt) ≥ t − R(t)

as long as ˙R ≤ 1, i.e. in all physical situations, so that
we already have the solution.
In the second case we have to solve the equation

z = teqv + R(teqv), as explained previously. We have

t + R(t) ≤ teqv + R(teqv) ≤ t + dt + R(t + dt),

which, with ˙R ≥ −1, implies

t ≤ teqv ≤ t + dt.

Having found teqv we can derive G′(z) from Eq. 6 be-
cause, with zeqv ≡ teqv − R(teqv),
t − R(t) ≤ zeqv ≤ t + R(t)

| ˙R| ≤ 1 ,

so that again we have the necessary information to de-
termine the evolution of the ﬁeld. G(z) can then be ob-
tained by the numerical integration of G′(z). Note how-
ever that while ˙R = 1 still admits a solution for the ﬁeld,
˙R = −1 doesn’t, because the boundary condition requires
G′ (t + dt − R(t + dt)) = G′ (t + 2dt − R(t)) = 0, which
in general is inconsistent. Evolving backward in time,
i.e. with dt < 0, the opposite would be true.

with V (R) = 1
numerically by a standard ﬁnite diﬀerence method.

Using the procedure above we have studied the case
2 K(R − R0)2, solving, step by step, Eq. 2
As initial condition for the ﬁeld we choose the funda-
mental mode of the static cavity with Eqs. 4 as the b.c.,
R(t0) = R0, and ˙R(t0) = 0:

(cid:26) φ = sin ωt0 cos ωx ,

φt = ω cos ωt0 cos ωx ,

w ≡

π
R0

.

(7)

For convenience we deﬁne the dimensionless parameters

α and β: α ≡ M/ω, β ≡ Ω/ω = pK/M /ω, and we set

the amplitude of the initial ﬁeld to be 1. In the case of
a wall initially at rest and with a large mass compared
to the initial energy of the ﬁeld, we expect the dynamics
not to depart considerably from the adiabatic one, that
is, the wall’s motion should be well approximated by the
solution of Eq. 2, with the ﬁeld’s pressure term replaced
by its static wall counterpart and the solution of Eq. 3
by

φ(x, t) = sin ω(t)t cos ω(t)x

w(t) ≡

π

R(t)

.

(8)

In order to check the reliability of our numerical im-
plementation of the algorithm, we ﬁrst considered a large
mass of the wall (α = 1000/π, β = 1/(10π√2)). We ver-
iﬁed that the total energy is very well conserved and the
motion of the wall is well reproduced by the solution of
Eq. 2 with the static wall solution for the ﬁeld pressure.

We then used a smaller mass keeping K constant,
i.e. α = 100/π and β = 1/(π√20). As shown in Fig. 1,
both the wall motion and the ﬁeld energy density become
nontrivial. An interesting feature is the concentration
of the energy density, shown in Fig. 1c. This is con-
ﬁrmed by the plot of the energy density at two instances
t = 349R(to) and t = 697R(to) in Fig. 2 compared with
the static cavity solution. The two peaks at t = 697R(to)
move in opposite directions, and their widths decrease
in time. This phenomenon is even more evident with
α = 10/π and β = 1/(π√2) (Fig. 3a), showing a com-
plex distribution of the peak locations and heights. The
total energy of the system is the same in all cases.
Even for the case in Fig. 3b (α = 1000/π, β =
1/(10π√2)), for which we observed the adiabatic evo-
lution lasting for a long time after t0, we can still, letting
the system evolve long enough, observe the squeezing of
the ﬁeld energy density in spite of the slow motion of
the wall. Keeping K constant we found that the time at
which the focusing of the energy starts increases roughly
linearly with M . This suggests that, as one takes into ac-
count the backreaction of the ﬁeld on the wall motion, the
long-time dynamics always becomes nonadiabatic. We
have veriﬁed that this remains true also changing the
boundary conditions so that the ﬁeld equals zero at the
boundaries.

We believe that the origin of this phenomenon lies in
the mechanism of energy exchange between the wall and
the ﬁeld. To explain it we give the following qualita-
tive argument. Let’s consider the interaction between
the wave inside the cavity and the wall. At some in-
stance, the peak of the wave will hit the wall, which can
be moving either outward or inward. In the former case,
there will be a transfer of energy from the ﬁeld to the wall,
and the speed of the wall will increase slightly. The wave-
fronts following the peak will lose more and more energy
to the wall, since the wall moves faster with each succes-
sive collision. As a result the spatial width of the energy
distribution decreases. When the wall moves inward, the
wave gains energy from the wall, and the wavefronts fol-
lowing the peak gain less because the wall moves slower
with each successive collision. Again the width of the
waveform decreases. After some time, this eﬀect leads to
a drastic concentration of energy into narrow peaks.

Our argument depends only on kinematics and should
therefore be applicable not only to waves but many other
systems, such as a set of particles bouncing back and
forth in a dynamical cavity. For simplicity we consider
the dynamics of a set of massless non-interacting parti-
cles, each having momentum and energy pi, |pi| (c = 1).
Inside the cavity they move unperturbed at the speed of
light. If a particle bounces on the static wall, its momen-
tum changes sign. The movable wall is subjected to a
2 K (R − R0)2. The particle
harmonic potential V (R) = 1
momentum p′′
i and the wall velocity v′′ after an inter-
action, which is assumed to be instantaneous, are easily

2

derived from energy and momentum conservation:

v′′ =p(1 + v′)2 + 4p′/M − 1 ,
p′′ = p′ + M (v′ − v′′) ,

(9)

where v′ and p′ are the wall velocity and particle mo-
mentum before the collision. The above equations are
derived assuming that the sign of p′′ is always opposite
to the sign of p′, which is true as long as the speed of the
wall is less than 1 and 2M (1 − v′) > p′ (p′ > 0).
We consider ﬁrst a set of 1000 particles all with the
same initial momentum pi = 0.01/R(t0) and a wall ini-
tially at rest with M = 1000/R(t0) and Ω = 1/R(t0).
Already after a few interactions with the wall we could
observe a regular transfer of energy from the last to the
ﬁrst particles to hit the wall.
In Fig. 4a we show the
momenta of the particles after a time t = 3221R(t0) as a
function of their position. For clarity only positive mo-
menta are plotted. It is remarkable that the ﬁrst particle
to hit the wall has gained more than one tenth of the total
energy of the system. The above is a very special situ-
ation which however demonstrates the process of energy
transfer among particles.

We then extend this simple mechanical model to the
case of an inﬁnite number of particles labeled with a con-
tinuous index k, each having position q(k) and momen-
tum p(k)dk. In this way we can deﬁne an energy density:

E(x, t) ≡Z dk|p(k, t)|δ(q(k, t) − x) .

(10)

Not surprisingly E(x, t) satisﬁes the wave equation in-
side the cavity. We numerically simulate such a system
choosing 2000 particles. Initially, we put two particles at
each of the 1000 uniformly separated sites, and the pairs
have opposite momenta p(k) = ±10(π2 cos2 πq(k) + 1).
In Fig. 4b we plot E(0, t)R2(t), which is evidently similar
to Fig. 1, although the details of the evolution depend on
how the particles or the ﬁeld interact with the wall.

After a long time we observe the formation of many
smaller peaks in the energy density. Further work is
needed to understand the problem of the t → ∞ evo-
lution of the system.
For the scalar ﬁeld an important situation to study is
when Ω = π/R0, i.e., when the wall motion is in reso-
nance with the ﬁeld inside the cavity. We have computed
the solutions of Eqs. 2 and 3 for various masses of the
wall. In Fig. 5 we plot the wall’s position and the ﬁeld en-
ergy density at x = 0 vs. time in the case of α = 1000/π,
R(t0) = R0 and ˙R(t0) = 0.1.
In this case we choose
t0 = R0/2 so that ˙φ = 0 and the initial functions Eq. 7
satisfy the boundary condition Eqs. 4 with ˙R(t0) 6= 0.
Besides the beats in the wall motion, two features are
important. One is the fact that the wall continues to re-
turn to its initial position after a time T = R0. This is
diﬀerent from the case of non-resonant wall parameters
where the back reaction of the ﬁeld changes the frequency

3

of the wall motion. Another remarkable eﬀect, as a con-
sequence, is the appearance of narrow peaks typical of
a resonantly driven wall motion [5,7,9]. This indicates
the possibility of transferring a large amount of energy
to the ﬁeld even with an external, non-resonant, driving
force [8,10]. As long as the frequency of the cavity wall is
Ω = π/R0, it is enough to push the wall at the instances
marked by the arrows in Fig. 5, and this frequency de-
pends on the mass of the wall and can be much smaller
than Ω; increasing the mass decreases the frequency of
energy exchange between wall and ﬁeld. This fact might
help to by-pass the experimental diﬃculty of achieving a
resonant driving force, i.e. at frequency Ω, on a mirror
in order to produce high frequency photons [8].

We have veriﬁed that for a small mass, α = 10/π, the
wall period remains close to T = 2R0 so that the motion
is still resonant [7].

In Ref. [7] it has been shown that the method of null
lines can also be applied to waves inside an oscillating
spherical cavity for any value of the angular momentum.
However, when considering a self-consistent wall motion,
the spherical symmetry is achieved only in the case of s-
waves, for which the radial (φ) and angular parts can be
separated. Deﬁning ψ ≡ rφ, so that ψ satisﬁes the one-
dimensional wave equation, we can apply the null lines
method. The boundary condition for φ, derived from the
action similarly to Eqs. 4, is:

˙Rφt(R(t), t) = −φr(R(t), t) ,

which however for ψ translates to:

˙Rψt(R(t), t) =

ψ(R(t), t)

R(t) − ψr(R(t), t) .

(11)

(12)

If we want φ to be ﬁnite at r = 0 then we must re-
quire ψ = 0 at r = 0, which is satisﬁed by writing
ψ = G(t − r) − G(t + r). Eq. 12 becomes:

G′ (t + R(t)) − ηG (t + R(t))
= γ = − 1− ˙R

G′ (t − R(t)) − ηG (t − R(t)) ,

1+ ˙R

(13)

with η ≡ 1/R(cid:16)1 + ˙R(cid:17). An eﬀective way to solve Eq. 13
numerically for G (t + R(t)) is to deﬁne z = t + R(t) and
to approximate η and γ with a constant value between
z and z − dz for a small enough dz. Integrating Eq. 13
between z and z − dz we obtain:
γ

(14)

G(z) =(cid:20)G(z − dz) +

η(cid:21) eηdz −

which turns out to be more accurate than standard nu-
merical integration.

The force of the s-wave ﬁeld on the wall is Fφ =

tions for the ﬁelds:

where ω ≃ 4.4934/R(t0) is chosen such that φ(r, t0) sat-
isﬁes Eq. 11 with ˙R(t) = 0. As in the 1D case, we observe
the formation of high energy density regions, although in
3D, this process is much slower. In Fig. 6 we plot the
energy density at r = R(t) vs. time for α = 5/4.4934 and
β = √8/4.4934. These values of the parameters produce
a completely non-adiabatic evolution. For larger M or
smaller K we have to evolve the system for a much longer
time in order to observe the formation of high energy
peaks. However we have veriﬁed that imposing φ = 0
at r = R(t) the peaks appear much earlier and the dy-
namics is very similar to the one-dimensional situation.
With resonant wall parameters, Ω = π/R(t0), the fea-
tures observed in 1D remain in 3D. With the b.c. Eq. 11
it is also possible to have resonances with Ω equal to the
diﬀerence between the frequencies of the nth mode and
the fundamental mode of the cavity. However such an Ω
is close to nπ/R(t0) if n is large, and such resonances are
not easily distinguishable from the geometric ones [7].

In summary we have applied the null lines method to
study the dynamics of a scalar ﬁeld inside a cavity whose
wall is subjected to a harmonic force and the pressure
due to the scalar ﬁeld. We have found that the long
time evolution of the system is always non-adiabatic, re-
gardless of the parameters of the system. In particular
there is an interval of time when the ﬁeld develops nar-
row packets in energy density that bounce back and forth
inside the cavity, which can be understood by means of
a simple mechanical analog consisting of a set of mass-
less particles bouncing inside a one-dimensional box with
a movable wall. Such a system conﬁrms our hypothesis
that the wall motion provides a mechanism of energy
transfer from low to high energy regions. We have veri-
ﬁed that the focusing of energy is a robust phenomenon,
being insensitive to the type of potential for the wall and
the presence of an external driving force.

For a quantized ﬁeld previous works [8] have shown
that in the case of a prescribed slow wall motion no pho-
ton production is achieved. Our results strongly suggest
that the back-reaction of the ﬁeld may change signiﬁ-
cantly the evolution of the system. In particular the sec-
ond derivative of the wall position, which is one of the
quantities that determine the number of quanta [8], can
be much larger than in the adiabatic case, as it can be
seen from the slope of ˙R in Fig.1. If the initial number of
fundamental mode quanta is large, the peaks in energy
density in the classical solution can imply the production
of several high energy quanta.

We have also studied the special situation in which the
wall frequency is equal to the fundamental frequency of
the static cavity ﬁeld. Remarkably the frequency of the
wall motion does not change due to the ﬁeld pressure,
and thus narrow peaks typical of a resonantly driven wall

motion are produced. A large amount of energy may be
transferred to the ﬁeld by providing mechanical energy
to the wall when the amplitude of the oscillation reaches
its minimum. This fact might help to by-pass the experi-
mental diﬃculty of achieving a resonant driving force on
a mirror in order to produce high frequency photons [8].

In a further work we would like to address the problem
of whether periodical solutions are admitted for this kind
of system and for which values of parameters.

Optical binding of particles with or without the presence of a ﬂat dielectric surface

Optical ﬁelds can induce forces between microscopic objects, thus giving rise to new structures of
matter. We study theoretically these optical forces between two spheres, either isolated in water, or
in presence of a ﬂat dielectric surface. We observe diﬀerent behavior in the binding force between
particles at large and at small distances (in comparison with the wavelength) from each other. This
is due to the great contribution of evanescent waves at short distances. We analyze how the optical
binding depends of the size of the particles, the material composing them, the wavelength and, above
all, on the polarization of the incident beam. We also show that depending on the polarization, the
force between small particles at small distances changes its sign. Finally, the presence of a substrate
surface is analyzed showing that it only slightly changes the magnitudes of the forces, but not their
qualitative nature, except when one employs total internal reﬂection, case in which the particles are
induced to move together along the surface.

I. INTRODUCTION

Some time ago, it was demonstrated that optical ﬁelds
can produce forces on neutral particles,1,2 since then this
mechanical action has been used in optical tweezers3 and
more recently in optical force microscopy,4,5 as well as
in manipulating molecules6 and dielectric spheres.7–9 In
addition, the possibility of binding objects10 through op-
tical forces and thus create microstructures, either in or
oﬀ resonant conditions,11–13 were pointed out.

In this paper we wish to undertake a detailed study
on optical forces on neutral particles, based on a rig-
orous analysis that we have carried out14–16 in a full
three-dimensional conﬁguration by using the coupled
dipole method (CDM) of Purcell and Pennypacker17 via
the Maxwell’s stress tensor.18 Speciﬁcally, we study the
forces induced by light between two spheres, either iso-
lated in solution, or in the presence of a ﬂat dielectric
surface. We shall monitor the nature, either attractive or
repulsive, of the light induced force between the spheres,
according to the wavelength, polarization of the incident
wave, and the size and composition of the spheres.

In Section II we outline the calculation method em-
ployed to determine the optical binding forces, then, in
Section III we present results for spheres either isolated in
water (III A) or suspended in this liquid in the presence
of a ﬂat dielectric interface (III B).

II. METHOD USED FOR COMPUTING THE
OPTICAL BINDING

In a previous article14 we showed the possibility to
compute the optical forces on a sphere with the cou-
pled dipole method (CDM).17 For the computation of the
optical binding between particles, we now use the same
procedure, thus we shall next only outline the main equa-
tions and the changes introduced in them to address the
presence of multiple objects.

Let K objects be above a ﬂat dielectric surface. Each
object is discretized into Nk subunits, with k = 1, . . . , K.
Following the procedure of Ref. [17], the ﬁeld at the
(i, k)th subunit, namely, the ith subunit of the kth ob-
ject, can be written as:

E(rk

i , ω) = E0(rk

where αl
j is the polarizability of the (j, l) subunit, T is
the linear response to a dipole in free space,19 and S rep-
resents the linear response of a dipole in the presence
of a surface.20,21 The value of the electric ﬁeld at each
subunit position is obtained by solving the linear system
Eq. (1) written for all subunits, so that the size of the
K
system to solve is
k=1 Nk. Once the electric ﬁeld is ob-
tained, the component of the total averaged force on the
(i, k)th subunit can be deduced from both the ﬁeld and
its derivative at its position rk

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In Fig. 1 we represent the more complex geometry that
we shall consider in this work. Two spheres (either di-
electric or metallic) are embedded in water (εw = 1.69).
Illumination with an incident plane wave takes place in
the XZ plane at an angle θ of incidence. When a dielec-
tric ﬂat surface at z = 0 is used, we consider it separating
glass (εs = 2.25) at z < 0 from water (z > 0).

per: two spheres of radius r on a dielectric ﬂat surface. The
spheres are embedded in water with εw = 1.69, and the rel-
ative permittivity of the surface is εs = 2.25. The incident
wave vector k0 is in the XZ plane, and θ is the angle of
incidence.

In this section we do not address yet the presence of
the surface (εs = εw = 1.69), i.e. S(rk
j, ω) = 0 in
Eq. (1), and the angle of incidence is θ = 0◦. Even in the
absence of surface, we make reference to the polarization
and thus we shall always use the terms p-polarization and
s-polarization when the electric ﬁeld vector is in the XZ
plane and along the Y -axis, respectively.

represents s-polarization. a) Force for short distances be-
tween the spheres, the symbol + (×) corresponds to the val-

resents the values from the non-retarded approximation in far
ﬁeld for p-polarization (s-polarization).

We begin with the most simple case, i.e., the radius r
of the two particles is small compared to the wavelength
employed. As previously said, we then use the dipole
approximation. We study, ﬁrst, the case of two identi-
cal spheres with ε1 = ε2 = 2.25, radius r =10nm at a
wavelength λ =632.8nm in vacuum. Fig. 2 represents
the force along the X-direction on the sphere B at dif-
ferent positions of this sphere on the X-axis. The sphere
A remaining ﬁxed. We have only plotted the force ex-
erted on sphere B, since by symmetry, the force along
the X-axis on sphere A is the opposite to that on B.
We observe two facts: ﬁrst, the oscillation of the force
when the spheres are far from each other, and, second,
the strong force, either attractive or repulsive, when the
spheres are very close from each other, depending on the
polarization. For a better understanding of the physical
process, using Eq. (1) and its derivative for two dipolar
objects, we can analytically determine, through Eq. (2),
the force on the spheres. Then, on using the fact that
there is a plane wave in the Z-direction (the incident
wave is E0i eik0z, where i = x or y depending of the po-
larization of the incident ﬁeld) the force on the second
sphere can be written as:

muted. But, even in this simple case, the exact analyti-
cal solution of Eq. (4) is not easy to interpret. Hence,
we make in Eq. (1) the approximation that the term
T(rk
j is smaller than 1 (we will discuss further
this approximation). Now, if we used the hypothesis that
the two spheres are identical (α1 = α2), Eq. (4) becomes :

points (with the symbols + and
approximation are shown in Fig. 2a and ﬁt correctly
the curves obtained without any approximation, as seen
in this ﬁgure. Thus, they validate the approximation
T(rk
1 previously done. Only when the
spheres are very close to each other this approximation
slightly departs from the exact calculation due to the
increase of the free space susceptibility. In fact, this ap-
proximation assumes the dipole associated to the spheres
as only due to the incident ﬁeld, which is a good assump-
tion when the polarizabilities are small, like for glass
spheres.
It is now easy to physically understand from
Eq. (5) the reason of this either attractive or repulsive
force. As the spheres are small, the scattering force is
negligible22 and thus only the gradient force remains due
to the interaction between the dipole associated to sphere
B, and to the variation of the ﬁeld created by sphere A at
the position of sphere B. In p-polarization, the ﬁeld due
to sphere A at the position of sphere B and the dipole of
sphere B are in phase, hence sphere B is pushed to the
higher intensity region, namely towards sphere A. In s-
polarization, as the ﬁeld due to sphere A at the position
of sphere B and the dipole of sphere B are in opposition
of phase, sphere B is pushed to the lower intensity region,
namely, far from sphere A. One can observe a similar ef-
fect in an atom mirror23, or on a small silver particle in
an evanescent ﬁeld.16

On the other hand, in the far ﬁeld we obtain, from
the appendix, the force upon sphere B as: Fx(r2) =
0 cos(k0a)/a2 in p-polarization and Fx(r2) =
2k2
α1E0x |

2k3
0 sin(k0a)/(2a) in s-polarization, with k0 =

−|
2π√εw/λ. The same explanation as before can be used
for the sign of the force:
following the phase relation-
ship between the dipole and the ﬁeld due to sphere A,
the force is either positive or negative, hence, the oscilla-
tions of the force Fx take place with period λ/√εw. The
phase diﬀerence λ/(4√εw) which appears in the far ﬁeld
between the oscillations of s and p polarization, comes
from the diﬀerence between the derivative in the com-
ponents xx and yy of the free space susceptibility. We
observe that the force in p-polarization decreases faster
than in s-polarization, this is due to the absence of a
propagating ﬁeld along the X-axis in the far ﬁeld. The

magnitude of the force diﬀers by a factor 104 between far
ﬁeld and near ﬁeld. This is due to the strong interaction
between the spheres through the evanescent waves.

We can make an analogy in the near ﬁeld with molec-
ular physics.
If we look at the dipole moment of the
two spheres, we compare our system of forces with the
interaction between two molecules. In p-polarization, as
the dipole moments are aligned and antisymmetric, they
produce an attractive force analogous to that between
In
two orbitals pz, giving rise to a bonding state σu.
s-polarization, the dipole moments are parallel and sym-
metric, so we have antibonding states π∗

that the two spheres cannot be bound.

whereas the dashed line represents s-polarization.

We represent in Fig. 3 the force along the Z-direction.
In this case the scattering force is predominant. The
interaction between the spheres is now directly respon-
sible for the oscillation of the force. Notice that when
the spheres are far from each other, as the interaction
between the spheres becomes weak when the distance in-
creases, the force tends toward the scattering force upon
one sphere due to the incident ﬁeld. As this force is not
responsible of optical binding, we are not going to discuss
it further.

388.5nm (dotted line), and 600nm (dashed line). Without
symbol: p-polarization; with symbol +: s-polarization.

More interesting is the case of two diﬀerent small
spheres, one (B) being dielectric and the other (A) be-
ing metallic (silver). The ﬁrst fact easily observed from
Eq. (4) pertains to the non retarded case, as the deriva-
tive of the free space susceptibility is real, the forces on
spheres A and B are equal but of opposite sign to each
other (this is no longer the case in the far ﬁeld). In Fig. 4
we represent the force on sphere B at short distances
from sphere A (in comparison with the wavelength), for
λ = 365nm, 388.5nm, and 600nm. For p-polarization, we
observe that the force at the wavelength λ = 365nm has
a rather strange behavior as it is positive, and only when
the spheres are almost in contact, this force changes and
becomes similar to those at the other wavelengths. With
the approximation T(rk

non retarded approximation can be written

We observe that the sign of the force depends of
When
e(α1) > 0 (λ = 600nm), which is the com-
mon case, the dipole associated to the silver sphere is
in phase with the applied ﬁeld, so everything happens as
for the dielectric sphere. Conversely, when
e(α1) < 0
(λ = 365nm) the dipole is in opposition of phase with
the applied ﬁeld, and hence the force becomes positive.
But when the spheres are almost in contact, the approx-
imation T(rk
1 is no longer valid as shown
when
e(α1) = 0 (λ = 388.5nm), case in which the force
is not null but negative. This is due to the fact that
the polarizability of the silver sphere is large and hence
the approximation is no longer valid for short distances.
Physically, this represents the contribution of the metallic
sphere to the electric ﬁeld acting on the dielectric sphere,

which is larger than that of the incident ﬁeld, hence the
dipoles associated to the two spheres are in phase and
the force is attractive. Notice that the change of sign
occurs both at the plasmon resonance (
2εw)
and when
εw. When ε1 is between these two
values, the real part of the polarizability is negative. For
a more complete discussion on this, one can see Ref. [16].
A similar reasoning can be done for s-polarization. If we
now make the analogy previously done with the molec-
ular orbitals, then depending on the wavelength in s-
polarization, we shall obtain either antibonding states

As the spheres are small, we can take only the gradi-

is real.15 Therefore, the forces on spheres A and B for
the wavelength λ = 600nm, where
m(α1) is weak, are
opposite to each other like for two identical spheres. But
at λ = 388.5nm, where
e(α1) = 0, the forces on the two

It should be remarked that if the laser intensity of the
incident light is assumed to be 0.2W/µm2,24 the opti-
cal forces for these small spheres are not strong enough
to create an optical binding, since then the Brownian
motion stays the dominant force.
In this respect, the
interest of the case of these small spheres is mainly the
interpretative value it yields of the underlying physics.
However, for larger radius in comparison to the wave-
length, the forces become larger and so is the trapping
potential.
In Figs. 5b and 6b we plot the force along
the X-axis for two dielectric spheres (glass) with radius
r = 100nm, and 200nm, respectively. We observe that
with the intensity used previously (0.2W/µm2) the mag-
nitude of the force is now enough to optically binding
both spheres. We compute the potential energy of the
optical trap by integration of the force (we take the po-
tential energy null when the second sphere is at inﬁnity).
As the two spheres are identical, the potential energy is
the same for both. The eﬃciency of the trapping force
requires it to be larger than the force due to the Brown-
ian motion, hence the depth of the potential wells of the
trap should be larger than kbT , T being the temperature
of water, and kb the Boltzmann constant. Considering
10−21J. We plot in Figs. 5a
T =290K, then kbT = 4
and 6a the potential normalized to the value kbT . We
adopt the criterion that the trap is eﬃcient when the po-
tential well is larger that 3kbT . Hence the bars plotted
at the bottom of the wells in Figs. 5a and 6a correspond
to the value 3. We see from Fig. 5 that for p-polarization
the trap is not feasible except when the spheres are in
contact. For s-polarization, we have three equilibrium
positions spaced out by one wavelength. This behavior
is explained by the previous results on small spheres, and
in agreement with experiments.10 When the size of the
sphere is close to one wavelength, we see from Fig. 6 that
the depth of the potential well is larger than in the pre-
vious case.
In p-polarization there is no possibility to
stick the spheres together, but now we have one poten-
tial minimum of stable position. Thus, we observe that
it is easier to trap particles when their radius are large,
in agreement with the experiments of Burns et al.10.

Notice that the gravity force is 6.16

10−5 pN and
10−4 pN for the spheres of radii r=100nm and
4.93
200nm, respectively. Another force that exists between
the spheres is the Casimir-Polder force, Fc. To our knowl-
edge, Fc has often been studied either between two plates
or between a sphere and a plate,25 but it has never
been established between two spheres.
In the non re-
tarded approximation and the dipole approximation for
the spheres, Fc is reduced to the dispersion force (Lon-
don’s force) which is inversely proportional to the sev-
enth power of the distance between the dipoles (see for
example Ref. [26]). Hence, only when the spheres are
in contact, or at distances smaller than the wavelength
from each other, this force might be of the same magni-
tude of the optical forces. However, the fast decay of this
force at distances larger than the wavelength prevents it
to perturb the optical trap.

In table 1 we give some examples on the limiting radius
to get optical trapping for two identical spheres embed-
ded in water (notice that for p polarization we do not
mean optical trapping when the spheres are sticked in
contact), i.e., the minimum radius to obtain one poten-
tial minimum of stable position for the two spheres using
the same criterion as before (namely, U > 3kbT ).

TABLE I. Minimum radius to get one minimum position of the potential for two identical spheres. The following cases are
addressed: glass sphere, silver sphere (both oﬀ and in plasmon resonance) The criterion of stability used is: the potential well
depth must be larger that 3kbT .

We should remark that this is the limiting radius only
to obtain the ﬁrst stable position, if we want to get more
stable positions, as in Ref.[10], the radius must be larger.

As mentioned before, the table shows that the optical
trapping is easier for s polarization. For the silver sphere,
the value λ = 394nm corresponds to the plasmon reso-

5

nance, and that of λ = 314nm is for a wavelength out of
resonance. At the plasmon resonance the polarizability
is largest, so it is easier to perform optical binding at this
wavelength.

FIG. 7. The sphere A is of glass and the sphere B of sil-
ver with r =100nm, λ = 388.5nm. The laser intensity of the
incident light is 0.2W/µm2. Plot of the potential normalized
to kbT for the two spheres versus the distance between them.
The full line is for p-polarization and dashed line corresponds
to s-polarization. The potential of sphere A is without sym-
bol, and the potential of sphere B is with symbol +.

As a last instance, we now consider two spheres in
free space, with radii r =100nm, one being of glass
and the other of silver, illuminated by a plane wave at
λ =388.5nm. We plot in Fig. 7 the potential energy
for the two polarizations and the two spheres, since now
this magnitude depends on the sphere material. We then
observe that it is not possible to obtain a stable equi-
librium since the potentials of the two spheres are now
diﬀerent. This result is explainable from the previous
calculation on small spheres (of silver and glass), since
then the forces were always opposed to each other at this
wavelength.
In fact, as the spheres are now large, the
forces at this wavelength are not exactly in opposition,
due to the larger scattering and absorbing force. Hence it
is possible to obtain points where the potential of the two
spheres is minimum. This happens when the forces on
each sphere are the same and positive. In that case, the
two spheres move in the direction of the positive X-axis
while keeping constant the distance between them.

B. Particles in water on a dielectric ﬂat surface

In this section we consider a ﬂat dielectric surface upon
which the spheres are suspended in water, as shown by
Fig. 1. We compute the force along the X-axis on sphere
B when both spheres are dielectric (glass), with θ = 0◦
(Fig. 8). We now observe that both for large and small
spheres the force has a behavior similar to that acting on

dielectric spheres isolated in water. When the spheres are
in contact, the force on sphere B is the same as in absence
of interface, whereas when the spheres are far from each
other, this force is slightly smaller than without interface.
This means that the optical binding is more diﬃcult to
perform when the spheres are on a surface than when
they are far from interfaces. Also, there is a change in
the period of oscillation due to interaction between the
spheres via the light reﬂected by the surface. However, in
the case when one of the spheres is metallic (silver), we
observe the same behavior of the forces when the surface
is present as without it. Then, as previously observed
for dielectric spheres, there only appears a shift in the
oscillation and magnitude of the forces.

FIG. 8. Force in the X-direction upon sphere B when
the spheres are placed on a ﬂat dielectric surface. θ = 0◦,
λ = 632.8nm. The full line represents the force in the pres-
ence of the surface, and the dashed line corresponds to the
force computed without the interface. The curves with sym-
bols + denote s-polarization, and those without symbol cor-
respond to p-polarization. a) spheres of glass with r =10nm.
b) spheres of glass with r =100nm.

In Fig. 9 we investigate the potential and optical force
on two glass spheres in front of a dielectric surface, illu-
minated by total internal reﬂection (θ = 50◦). Figure 9b
shows that the force component along the X-axis always
pushes the spheres in the direction of the wave vector
component parallel to the surface. Hence, it is not pos-
sible to obtain a stable equilibrium with the two spheres
remaining ﬁxed. But if we compute the potential of the
two spheres together (Fig. 9a), we observe some minima
indicating that the system can acquire internal equilib-
rium, namely, the relative positions of the spheres can be
kept ﬁxed. Hence, when both spheres move impelled by
the evanescent wave propagating along the surface, their
velocity remains parallel to this surface, while the dis-
tance between them keeps some particular values given
by the position of the potential minima (cf. Fig. 9a).
Notice that the force on the second sphere (in both po-
larizations) has no oscillation, a very similar behavior

6

was observed by Okamoto et .al.24. The computational
prediction of similar collective movements in systems of
more than two spheres will involve long computing times
of their relative positions by potential energy minimiza-
tion.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have studied the optical binding between two
spheres embedded in water, either in presence or absence
of a ﬂat dielectric interface. We have presented results
for diﬀerent sizes and illumination conditions. Some of
them agree with previous experiments10 for two identi-
cal spheres, however, when they are composed of diﬀerent
material, the force between them may have quite diﬀerent
behavior, depending on the light wavelength employed.
In future work, it would be interesting to investigate the
eﬀect of light on several spheres in water in order to
build up particle arrays. However, in this respect, the
vertical force that pushes the spheres away from the sub-
strate, constitutes a hindrance to this aim. This work
shows, however, that this problem can be avoided by il-
luminating the system under total internal reﬂection at
the substrate interface. Then the spheres will be sticked
to the surface by the gradient force due to the transmit-
ted evanescent wave. The horizontal force of this surface
wave on the spheres that pushes them along the inter-
face, can be compensated by means of a second counter-
propagating evanescent wave, created by an additional
beam. Notice, in addition, that if both surface waves are
mutually coherent, the resulting standing wave pattern
can introduce further structure in the resulting potential
wells acting on the spheres.

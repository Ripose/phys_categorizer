We propose experimentally simpliﬁed schemes of an optically dispersive interface region between
two coupled free electron lasers (FELs), aimed at achieving a much broader gain bandwidth than
in a conventional FEL or a conventional optical klystron composed of two separated FELs. The
proposed schemes can universally enhance the gain of FELs, regardless of their design when operated
in the short pulsed regime.

I. INTRODUCTION

Free-electron lasers (FELs) convert part of the kinetic energy of nearly-free relativistic electrons into coherent
radiation [1–4]. They can be of two types: 1) devices wherein the electrons are accelerated in a spatially periodic
magneto-static, electrostatic, or electromagnetic ﬁeld, called a wiggler or an undulator; 2) devices wherein the electrons
are unperturbed, but instead the laser wave is subject to dispersion, as in Cherenkov transition radiation.

In the classical description of FELs based on wigglers, the combined eﬀect of the wiggler and laser ﬁelds yields a
pondermotive potential which causes bunching of the electrons along the wiggler axis. This bunching is associated
with the gain or loss of energy by electrons, or, equivalently, their axial acceleration or deceleration, depending on the
phase between their transverse motion and the laser wave. The oscillation of electrons in the pondermotive potential
is described by the pendulum equation, which can yield near-resonant gain, provided the electron velocity allows it
to be nearly-synchronous i.e., maintain a slowly-changing phase, with this potential. The near-synchronism condition
is for the electron velocity to be near the resonant velocity

vr =

ν
kL + kW

,

(1)

where ν is the laser frequency, and kL(W ) are the laser (wiggler) wavevectors. The electrons whose velocities are
above vr contribute on average to the small-signal gain (radiation emission), and those whose velocities are below vr
contribute on average to the corresponding loss (radiation absorption).

This results in an antisymmetric dependence of the small-signal standard gain Gst on the deviation of the electron
velocity v from the resonant velocity vr. Such dependence has been thought to be a fundamental consequence of the
Madey gain-spread theorem [1–3], which states that the gain lineshape is antisymmetric, since it is proportional to the
derivative of the symmetric spontaneous-emission lineshape, which is a sinc2 function of (v − vr). This gain lineshape
allows for net gain only if the initial velocity distribution is centered above vr, which is often called momentum
population inversion. In other words, this gain lineshape restricts the momentum spread to values comparable with
the width of the positive (gain) part of Gst in order to achieve net gain. This width severely limits the FEL gain
performance at short wavelengths [2–4].

In a variant of the FEL, composed of two wigglers separated by a drift region between them (see Fig. 1) ﬁrstly
suggested by Vinokurov [5], known as an ”optical klystron” [6], the ﬁrst wiggler serves to ”bunch” the electron phases,
which then acquire favorable values in the drift region between the wigglers, and ﬁnally yield enhanced gain in the
second wiggler. However, in this case the width of the gain region is proportionally narrower, and this makes the
restrictions on the velocity spread even more severe.

In an attempt to overcome the adverse eﬀect of momentum spread on FEL gain, we have put forward ideas inspired
by lasing without inversion (LWI) [7] in atomic systems, namely, the cancellation of absorption by interference in the
gain medium. The analogous schemes proposed by us for FELs [8–11] involve two wigglers coupled by a specially
designed drift region, which yields a gain curve that diﬀers substantially from that of an optical klystron.
In an
optical klystron, the electrons drift between the wigglers in a dispersive region and, thereby, acquire a phase shift,

relative to the pondermotive potential, that increases with the deviation of the electron velocity from vr. This is
in contrast to our schemes [11], in which electrons in the drift region are magnetically deﬂected so as to acquire a
dispersion that is just opposite to the one for optical klystron: The introduced phase shift −(k + kW)(v + vr)T (T
being the mean interaction time in the wiggler) decreases with increasing deviation of the electron velocity from vr.
This cancels the interaction phase picked up in the ﬁrst wiggler, i.e., bunching is reversed. In addition, electrons with
initial velocities v < vr, which contribute on average to loss (absorption), are given a phase shift of π, in order to
cause destructive interference with electrons that contribute to loss in the second wiggler. In the resulting gain curve,
the usual absorptive part (below resonance) is eliminated, whereas the gain part above resonance is doubled [11]. This
implies that net gain is obtained in such schemes even from beams with a very broad (inhomogeneous) momentum
spread, whence we named them FEL Without Inversion (FELWI), analogously to atomic LWI.

The previously proposed FELWI schemes [8–11] may open new perspectives for short-wavelength FELs, provided
that the technical challenges associated with magnetic ﬁeld designs for the drift region are adequately met. In this
paper we propose a considerably simpler variant of such schemes, aimed at extending the optical gain bandwidth in
FELs. The proposed setup (Fig. 1) is equivalent to the previously proposed extension of momentum spread capable
of gain, by phase shift manipulations, yet it involves only optical (laser) phase shifts in the drift region (Sec. II). These
phase shifts are much easier to manipulate, since they require only linear optical elements - prisms or Bragg mirrors,
etc. (Sec. III). We conclude that the proposed scheme is universal, i.e., applicable to FELs regardless of their wiggler
design. It may substantially enhance the FEL performance in the pulsed regime (Sec. IV).

II. PRINCIPLES OF THE BROADBAND GAIN MECHANISM IN FELS

A. General formula for small-signal gain in two interfering wigglers

The dynamics of an electron interacting with the laser ﬁeld in wiggler I or II, is expressed by the pendulum equations

[2]

where

The coupling constant

Ω = qz(vz − vr), ψ = −∆νt + qzz + qxx + φ, qx = kL sin θ, qz = kL cos θ + kW .

is proportional to the laser ﬁeld amplitude and will be used as the perturbation parameter in the small signal regime.
The dynamics and resulting gain depends on the detuning Ω, which is a function of the laser frequency and the
initial velocity vz. A small change in the laser frequency by δω or in the electron velocity by δvz produces a similar
eﬀect on Ω, and thus on the FEL dynamics and gain (Fig. 2a, b). Here we assume that the electron beam has a
narrow distribution of electron velocities vz, and are mainly interested in the gain dependence on the laser frequency
variation δω. The detuning then depends on laser frequency as

Equations (2)-(4) are the basis of our consideration of uniform wigglers. In the ultrarelativistic limit, small changes
of the energy, momentum, detuning, and velocity are proportional to each other, so that in order to calculate the gain
we need only calculate the change in the detuning of the electrons upon averaging over the initial phase. Equations
(2) are eﬀectively one-dimensional, but ~q and Ω are two-dimensional (2D) parameters and this 2D dependence will
prove to be of vital importance.

In order to enhance the bandwidth of the FEL gain, we consider the setup of two identical wigglers of equal length
LW with a specially designed drift region between them, as described below. Since the change of electron energy
inside the ﬁrst and second wigglers is given by the same set of equations (2)-(4), we obtain, by taking into account
the phase shift in the drift region and averaging over the random initial phases, the following expression for gain in
the entire two-wiggler setup [11,12]

where T = LW /c(1 − vz/c) is the mean interaction time in the wiggler.

For ∆ψ = 0 the two-wiggler gain coincides with the result for one wiggler of twice the length. The resulting gain
dependence on the detuning Ω and laser frequency variation δω is depicted in Fig. 2a, 2b, respectively. The average
of this antisymmetric gain over detuning vanishes, in accordance with the Madey gain-spread theorem, which is the
main restriction on gain in short-wavelength FELs [2].

The electron oscillates coherently in the ponderomotive potential, and therefore its oscillations in the two sequential
wigglers exhibit interference with a phase ∆ψ which depends on the path (or time) diﬀerence between the two regions.
In an optical klystron, the phase shift, produced in a free space of length L between the wigglers, is equal to

∆ψklystron = kW L +

ckLqzL

ω2 Ω.

The gain dependence of the optical klystron on the detuning Ω and laser frequency δω is depicted in Fig. 3a. The
maximum gain exceeds that of the ordinary FEL, but the restriction on the spread of Ω (and therefore on δω in (5))
becomes more stringent, because of rapid oscillations of the gain dependence on the detuning (Fig. 3a).

B. Broadband gain by drift-region optical dispersion

In order to overcome the limitations of FELWI phase-shift implementation for electrons in magnetic ﬁelds discussed
in Sec. I, we consider the alternative phase shift produced by an optically dispersive drift region, where the light path
depends on the deviation δω of the laser frequency as follows

Here sL(ω) is the optical path depending on the laser frequency in the drift region, se is the electron path passing
through the drift region as before, ω0 is the mean laser frequency, and the corresponding phase shift is equal to

The spectral dispersion of the drift region in (8) allows us to manipulate the dependence of the gain (6) on detuning.
As a result, broadband gain appears, as shown in Fig. 3b. The explicit condition which the dispersion (8) must satisfy
in order to obtain broadband gain is

∆ψ = ∆ψ0 + δω 

∆ψ0 = ω0(

).

.

The gain dependence on the laser frequency deviation δω exhibits a broad band in Fig. 3b for the same parameters
as in Fig. 3a: the contrast between our design and an optical klystron is striking indeed, and demonstrates the crucial
eﬀect of optical dispersion on gain.

The extension of this treatment to situations wherein the eﬀects of δvz and δω are comparable involves the averaging
of (6) and (8) over a thermal spread of electron velocities. For moderate spreads the broadband character of the gain
persists, as seen in Fig. 3b.

Before we discuss implementations of the drift region for broadband gain, let us note here that, although, the
current and the FEL WI concepts are both based upon interference of radiation emitted by electron moving in the
ﬁrst and the second wigglers via phase shift created by the drift region, there is an important diﬀerence. As has
been shown in [12], the motion in the FEL WI drift region has to be 2D (otherwise, the phase density is conserved
in accordance with the Liouville’s theorem, and, for electron distribution having large spread of momenta, the gain
is zero). To obtain the broadband gain, it is not necessary to have the setup of drift region 2D (for electron motion),
but rather the optical dispersion of the drift region should satisfy to Eq. (10).

III. DRIFT REGION DESIGNS FOR BROAD BAND GAIN

We shall now discuss two possible experimental implementations of optically dispersive drift regions created by

optical elements in order to get broadband gain: (a) diﬀraction by prisms; (b) Bragg reﬂectors.

A. Drift region dispersion based on prisms

Let us consider a setup of the drift region depicted in Fig. 4. After the ﬁrst wiggler the electron beam, having
passed through free space of length se, enters the second wiggler. The laser beam is diﬀracted and guided by the set
of prisms 1, 2, 3, and 4, which are adjusted to have vanishing total dispersion. The phase shift introduced by this
setup for the laser ﬁeld is given by

the prism, se is the distance between prisms 1 and 4, which is also the electron path in the drift region. For a small
deviation of the laser frequency δω, the phase shift is given by

being the angular dispersion of the prism.

A properly chosen dispersion of the prisms, in accordance with Eq. (10), allows us to adjust the drift region so as

to have the broadband optical gain (see Fig. 3b). The choice, which cancels the δω term in (12), is:

The system of prisms is not the only way to create a proper phase shift. We may use a Bragg reﬂector instead,

depicted in Fig. 5. The phase shift introduced by a Bragg reﬂector is given by

It is instructive to calculate the dependence of gain width on the parameters of the drift regions. In Fig. 6, we
show the gain-width dependence on the dispersion of the drift region, dψ/dω. The ﬁgure demonstrates that the gain
width can be made as large as the spectral range wherein the pondermotive interaction between the electrons and
the laser ﬁeld does not vanish (as seen in Fig. 3a, there is no spectral range where the gain is negative). Clearly,
the parameters that provide broad-band gain are diﬀerent for the drift regions shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, but the
gain-width dependence on the total dispersion dψ/dω is universal .

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown in this paper that the small-signal gain in a FEL comprised of two coupled wigglers can exhibit
a broadband character as a function of the laser frequency, if their interface (the region wherein electrons and light
drift without interaction) is endowed with appropriate optical dispersion. This design is based on the same principles
as in [10,11], except that in [11] specially designed magnetic ﬁelds are proposed for manipulating the drift-region
phase shifts, whereas here linear optical elements, such as prisms (Sec. IIIA) or a Bragg reﬂector (Sec. IIIB) suﬃce.
The present dispersive scheme, similarly to [11], achieves the cancellation of absorption in a broad spectral range by
destructive interference of frequencies that contribute on average to loss in the two wigglers, and the reinforcement
of emission by constructive interference of frequencies that contribute to gain. Remarkably, the resulting broad-band
gain exhibits universal dependence on the optical dispersion, and is compatible with existing FELs, regardless of their
design. The broadband character of the gain persists for moderate spreads of electron velocities.

The proposed scheme may allow eﬀective FEL operation using femtosecond optical pulses, which correspond to a
wide spectral band: a gain bandwidth of ∼ 20c/LW (Fig. 3) may attain 1014 Hz values for optical wigglers with
submicron periods [2–4].

oscillations because of interference between waves emitted in the ﬁrst and in the second wiggler. (b) By proper adjustment
of the phase shift for every laser frequency via an appropriately designed dispersive drift region, satisfying Eqs. (8)-(10), the
broad band gain has been obtained. For the case (b) two curves are shown: (1) without electron momentum spread and (2)

gain exists (normalization by T as in Fig. 2, 4).

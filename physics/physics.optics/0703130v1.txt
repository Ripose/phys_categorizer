Abstract— Practical design parameters of resonant metama-
terials, such as loss tangent, are derived in terms of
the
quality factor Q of the resonant effective medium permeability
or permittivity. Through electromagnetic simulations of loop-
it is also shown that the Q of the
based resonant particles,
effective medium response is essentially equal to the Q of an
individual resonant particle. Thus, by measuring the Q of a
single fabricated metamaterial particle, the effective permeability
or permittivity of a metamaterial can be calculated simply and
accurately without requiring complex simulations, fabrication, or
measurements. Experimental validation shows that the complex
permeability analytically estimated from the measured Q of
a single fabricated self-resonant loop agrees with the complex
permeability extracted from S parameter measurements of a
metamaterial slab to better than 20%. This Q equivalence
reduces the design of a metamaterial to meet a given loss
constraint to the simpler problem of the design of a resonant
particle to meet a speciﬁc Q constraint. This analysis also yields
simple analytical expressions for estimating the loss tangent of
a planar loop magnetic metamaterial due to ohmic losses. It is
shown that tan δ ≈ 0.001 is a strong lower bound for magnetic
loss tangents for frequencies not too far from 1 GHz. The ohmic
loss of the metamaterial varies inversely with the electrical size of
the metamaterial particle, indicating that there is a loss penalty
for reducing the particle size at a ﬁxed frequency.

I. INTRODUCTION

A NALYTICAL calculations have provided important in-

sight into how the effective electromagnetic parameters
of engineered electromagnetic metamaterial structures behave
[1], [2]. But accurate, quantitative determination of those
parameters has been demonstrated primarily through complex
simulations or experimental measurements. Electromagnetic
simulations [3, and many others] and experimental measure-
ments [4] of the reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients of a
metamaterial slab have been used to extract the effective per-
mittivity and permeability through a well-established approach
[5], [6]. Different experimental measurements, including prism
refraction experiments [7], [8] and measurements of spatial
ﬁeld distributions inside the metamaterial [9], [10], have also
been used to infer the effective electromagnetic parameters of
metamaterials. These experimental procedures usually require
samples of a speciﬁc size and shape, either to ﬁll the entire
cross sectional area of a waveguide or to be large enough in
a free space measurement that edge effects are not important.
A procedure through which metamaterial parameters could be

accurately estimated either analytically or from measurements
of small material samples would enable simpler metamaterial
design.

Many metamaterials are based on magnetically or electri-
cally self-resonant particles so that a wide range of effective
parameters can be obtained in a controlled manner. There are
also universal relationships between resonance parameters that
apply to almost all resonant phenomena. Motivated by this, we
show how, by experimentally measuring or analytically esti-
mating the quality factor Q of the underlying resonant particle,
the frequency dependent effective parameters of a resonant
metamaterial can be accurately estimated. Simple analytical
forms for important speciﬁc parameters, such as the effective
loss tangent, in terms of Q and the geometry of the unit cell are
also derived. Although effective metamaterial parameters can
be written in terms of equivalent circuit parameters [1], [11], in
practice it can be difﬁcult to compute the effective resistance of
a structure because of spatially nonuniform current ﬂow in the
conductors. Losses in any dielectric substrate are a function of
the complicated ﬁeld distribution of the particle near resonance
and are difﬁcult to predict without detailed simulations. Q

II. QUALITY FACTOR EQUIVALENCE

Two distinct resonant responses are involved in a metamate-
rial, each with its own quality factor Q. An individual resonant
particle has a Q, which we call Qpart. The bulk magnetic (i.e.,
permeability) or electric (i.e., permittivity) material response
of a metamaterial composed of these resonant particles also
has a resonant frequency dependence [1], which we call Qmat.
We assert that under conditions relevant to metamaterials,
these two quality factors are essentially equal. Resonator cou-
pling can in general alter the Q of individual resonances, and
this does occur when the individual particles are assembled
into a metamaterial array. But metamaterials are typically
designed so that the coupled resonant particles all collectively
resonate at a frequency close to the resonance of an individual
particle. Losses are not shifted from one resonance to another,
nor are additional loss mechanisms created in an assembly of
these particles.

We demonstrate this Q equivalence through electromagnetic
simulations using the well-known loop resonator [1]. We
designed a capacitively loaded loop with a lumped resistor

in close agreement, with Qpart = 79.6 and Qmat = 71.
Other simulations with higher and lower Qs also revealed
the same basic Q equivalence with 10% or better agreement.
This functional form for µ breaks down when the particles are
not sufﬁciently small compared to wavelength, at which point
spatial dispersion becomes important [12] and loop radiation
resistance cannot be completely neglected. However, under
most practically useful metamaterial conditions, Qpart ≈
Qmat.

The value of this equivalence is that Qpart can be measured
from a single fabricated element or from a small material sam-
ple that may not be suitable for a full reﬂection/transmission
measurement. Qpart can also be analytically estimated under
many conditions. This Q equivalence thus enables rapid design
analysis without complex simulations and experiments.

The other parameter in (1), F , also plays a role in the
achievable values of µ. It can be shown analytically that, for
planar loop resonator conﬁgurations, F = µ0A2
loop/(VcellL)
[11], where Aloop is the area enclosed by a single loop
resonator, Vcell is the volume of a unit cell, and L is the
inductance of a single loop resonator. For planar loop resonator
conﬁgurations, F typically falls in the range 0.16 − 0.50,
depending on how densely packed the individual resonators
are [11]. We use this numerical range in the analysis below.

III. Q-BASED METAMATERIAL DESIGN EQUATIONS

With F numerically bounded, Qmat dominates the achiev-
able effective properties of a metamaterial. The Q equiva-
lence demonstrated above shows in turn that these properties
are completely dictated by Qpart. Consequently designing a
to achieve a speciﬁc objective (loss tangent,
metamaterial
minimum negative permeability or permittivity, etc) is reduced
to the simpler problem of designing and fabricating a resonant
particle with a given Q.

We now rearrange (1) to provide explicit equations for key
metamaterial properties in terms of Q (no subscript since
Qpart and Qmat are essentially equal) and F . Deﬁning χr =
Re(χm) and χi = Im(χm), it is straightforward to show that

The ratio |χi|/|χm|2 reduces to the simple form of

shows the speciﬁc element values (R = 3.58 Ω and C = 1.18
pF) and geometry of the 30 mm loop. The circuit parameter
extraction code Ansoft Q3D was used to extract an inductance
of 95.7 nH for this loop. Assuming the particle is sufﬁciently
small, it is an RLC circuit with Qpart = ((cid:112)L/C)/R = 79.6
and a self-resonant frequency of 1/
LC = 474 MHz. The
loop is consequently 21 times smaller than a wavelength at
resonance and the circuit approximation is justiﬁed.

where µ is the relative permeability of the medium and ω0
is the resonant frequency of the effective magnetic response.
The loss term is written in terms of Qmat, which is the
quality factor of the resonant-form magnetic susceptibility
χm = µ − 1. Analytical theory [1], [11] and simulations
[3] have all shown that
the magnetic response of such a
material follows this functional form. Although this form is
not exactly a constant-numerator Lorentzian, the difference is
not critical because the frequency range of interest is generally
in a narrow band around the resonant frequency and thus
ω ≈ ω0. Nevertheless, the Lorentzian form is useful in a
number of ways—for example, one can compute Q graphically
from a Lorentzian response from the maximum magnitude
divided by the full-width half power bandwidth. To obtain
a pure Lorentzian, we can simply normalize the susceptibility
to χm/ω2.

We used Ansoft HFSS to compute the S parameters of
this loop structure placed in a cubic unit cell 40 mm on a
side, and the effective permeability was extracted using the
standard approach [6]. Figure 1 overlays the resonant |χm|/ω2
and the series RLC admittance of a single particle based on
circuit theory (both are amplitude normalized to unity). The

Equation (6) is exact, but a few approximations lead to
simple and useful form. Under most circumstances, the desired
strong magnetic material response is achieved at frequencies
around 5–10% above or below the resonant frequency, and
ω0/ω ≈ 1. Moreover, if losses are not too severe (which is
usually desired), then |χm|2 ≈ |χr|2. The susceptibility loss
tangent is thus approximated by

Eq. (7) explicitly gives the susceptibility loss tangent (from
which any loss-related parameter can easily be calculated)
in terms of three simple parameters: the desired real part of
the susceptibility, the geometry-dependent factor F , and the
quality factor Q of an individual resonant particle.

The maximum imaginary part of the magnetic susceptibility
occurs at ω = ω0 and from (3) is given by max(χi) = F Q.
The maximum real part of the magnetic susceptibility for a
Lorentzian occurs very close to the frequency where |χr| =
|χi|. Setting (3) equal to (2) and substituting the resulting
relation back into (3), we ﬁnd that

Note that this maximum χr is always achieved with high losses
since |χr| = |χi| at that point.

IV. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS

As noted above, it can be shown analytically [11] that for
a planar loop resonant particle in a cubic unit cell, F ≈ 0.16.
This factor can be increased somewhat by narrowing the unit
cell in the loop-axial direction, but a practical limit appears
to be reached around F ≈ 0.5 because the strong inter-
loop interaction increases the effective inductance of a single
loop and thus inhibits further increase in F . This range of F
combines with (7) to give an approximate range of practically
achievable susceptibility loss tangents of

(9)

The implications of this are signiﬁcant. If, for example, one
wishes to design a magnetic metamaterial with a cubic unit
cell which has a permeability real part of −2 (thus χr =
−3) at some frequency, then |χi| = |µi| ≈ 54/Q at this
frequency, and the imaginary part of the susceptibility depends
only on the resonant particle Q factor. A maximum |µi| thus
immediately imposes a minimum Q required of the individual
resonators needed to realize this material. If a permeability
loss tangent of 0.01 is required (equivalent to |χi| = 0.02
for µr = −2), then Qpart must be at least 2700. This could
be reduced by roughly a factor of 3 by increasing F through
tighter spacing of the resonant particles. But it is unavoidable
that low loss tangents require high Q particles.

This analysis can be carried slightly farther to give a simple
equation for permeability loss tangent. It is straightforward to

show that

| tan δ| =

|χi|
|1 + χr|

≈

|χr|2
F Q|1 + χr|

.

The minimum value of | tan δ| occurs at χr = −2 (or
µr = −1) when the above expression is valid. Thus, provided
Q is not too small, the minimum achievable loss tangent is
min(| tan δ|) ≈ 4/F Q. For a cubic unit cell, min(| tan δ|) ≈
24/Q, while for a more tightly packed lattice (F =0.5),
min(| tan δ|) ≈ 8/Q. Q of the individual resonators thus
directly constrains the minimum loss tangent of the effective
medium.

The above equations are formed in terms of Q because this
parameter is often relatively straightforward to measure or
analytically estimate. The above analysis is also sufﬁciently
general to apply to all resonator based metamaterials and
is not limited to circuit-based elements. For example, [13]
reported the theoretical design of a plasmon-based magnetic
resonator for infrared metamaterials. Provided Q and F can
be estimated, the above equations apply equally well to such
a material.

V. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION

We validate and demonstrate this analysis by comparing the
permeability measured from the S parameters of a fabricated
magnetic metamaterial and estimated from the above design
equations using the measured Q of a single resonator. A split
ring structure with dimensions shown on the inset of Figure
2 was designed with a self resonant frequency of 685 MHz.
This copper structure was photolithographically fabricated on
FR4 substrate. The Q of a single capacitively loaded loop
particle was measured experimentally using an HP 8720A
network analyzer by measuring S11 of an 18 AWG wire
loop placed around the particle, which exhibits a resonant
response due to strong coupling of the loops when one loop
is resonant. Qpart = 68 was measured by ﬁtting a Lorentzian
to the difference between S11 measured with and without the
resonant particle. F for a magnetic metamaterial composed of
these loops was estimated by ﬁrst extracting the inductance of
a single, isolated loop using Ansoft Q3D, which was found to
be 101 nH. The loop area is Aloop = 409 mm2 and the unit
cell dimensions of 15 mm by 30 mm by 16 mm (Vcell = 7200
mm2) combine to give F = 0.29. This 101 nH isolated loop
inductance is smaller than the effective inductance of a loop
in the metamaterial array because of the mutual inductance
from particle coupling. The measured resonant frequency of
the array of particles is 640 MHz, which corresponds to an
increase in total inductance to 116 nH assuming the particle
capacitance is constant. This inductance correction lowers F
to 0.25. This F = 0.25 and Q = 68 are sufﬁcient to compute
µ(f ) from (1) or to easily estimate loss tangents from (7).

A 1D array of 10 of these particles arranged in unit cells as
described above was placed in the interior of a 15 cm wide mi-
crostrip waveguide designed for 50 Ω impedance. The normal
incidence S parameters of the metamaterial-loaded and un-
loaded waveguide were measured with the same analyzer, and
from these the effective permittivity and permeability of the
loops were extracted [6]. Figure 2 shows the experimentally

VI. LIMITS ON OHMIC LOSSES IN PLANAR LOOP
MAGNETIC METAMATERIALS

Useful limits on ohmic losses for planar loop-based mag-
netic metamaterials can be obtained through further analysis.
As shown above, effective material loss tangents are linearly
proportional to (F Q)−1. Since F = µ0A2
loop/(VcellL) for
a planar loop material [11], and Q = ω0L/R,
this loss
tangent parameter (F Q)−1 = (VcellR)/(µ0ω0A2
loop). The
loop inductance does not play a role in the effective loss
tangent of the material. Only the unit cell size, the loop area,
the loop resistance, and the resonant frequency contribute to
losses.

This dependence is entirely expected because |χi| is pro-
portional to the magnetostatic energy loss per unit volume
per unit time. Equation (5) and the above show that this loss
is proportional to |χm|2R. But |χm| is proportional to the
magnetic dipole moment per unit volume, which for a current
I in a loop is IAloop/Vcell. Thus |χi| ∝ I 2R/Vcell, as expected
because resistive losses in the loop are the only losses in this
type of magnetic loop structure.

This simple expression for the loss tangent parameter
(F Q)−1 also gives important insight into how magnetic meta-
material losses scale with particle size and resonant frequency.
For a loop that comes close to spanning the side of a unit cell,
the ratio A2
loop/Vcell = mlcell, where lcell is the length of a
unit cell in the propagation direction and m is the number of
loops per cubic volume. For example, m = 2 applies to a unit
cell that is half as wide as it is long so that there are two loops
in a cubic volume. Using the above expression for (F Q)−1,
the susceptibility loss tangent is closely approximated by

The size of the unit cell relative to wavelength plays a role as
important as R in the metamaterial losses—the larger the unit
cell compared to wavelength, the lower the loss. This indicates
that simply scaling down the size of a loop particle in order
to better approximate a continuous medium will increase the
losses if R remains constant. And simple scaling that decreases
the loop length and loop width by the same factor will keep R
per particle close to constant. This suggests controlling losses
may be a challenge in magnetic metamaterials in which the
resonant particles are very small compared to wavelength.
Increasing m reduces the losses the losses, but there is a
practical limit to how many loops can be packed into a cubic
volume.

We can go even further by noting that the resistance of
planar loops is constrained based on their geometry. We
assume that the metal used for the loops is room temperature
copper. If we further assume that the thickness of the loop
copper is large compared to the skin depth, which will

measured complex permeability as a function of frequency.
Overlaid on the measurements is the estimated µ(f ) computed
using Q = 68 and F = 0.25 from (1). The agreement in both
real and imaginary parts is good through the entire region
of signiﬁcant magnetic response, with discrepancies typically
smaller than 20%. The measurement and estimate begin to
deviate somewhat above 670 MHz, which we attribute to a
combination of measurement uncertainty and weak secondary
resonances due to nonuniformities in the assembly of the
individual particles into the metamaterial array.

Figure 3 compares the measured and estimated permeability
|µi/µr|, which are also in good quantitative

agreement. To demonstrate the validity of the simpliﬁed ap-
proximations above, we also computed the loss tangent for
several values of µr from (10), again using Q = 68 and
F = 0.25, and overlaid them on the continuous curves. At
discrete values from µr = −2 to −5, this very simple estimate
is within 25% of the measured values. We emphasize that this
accurate estimate was obtained from a simple experimental
measurement of a single metamaterial particle and from a
straightforward calculation of the inductance of a single parti-
cle. The quantitative agreement is sufﬁciently good to enable
simple and accurate estimates of the achievable loss tangent
at a given value of µr from a measurement or simulation of
Qpart and an estimate of F based on the unit cell geometry.

minimize the loop resistance, then R is simply a function
of the number of individual geometric squares that compose
the loop. The surface resistance of a thick (compared to skin
depth) conducting sheet is (σδ)−1 ohms per square, where
σ is the conductivity of the metal and δ is the skin depth.
For copper, δ(f ) = 2.1/(cid:112)f (GHz) µm and thus the surface
resistance of the trace is Rs = 0.0082(cid:112)f (GHz) ohms per
square. Thus, a loop that is thick compared to skin depth and
composed of nsq squares of copper results in

min| tan δ| ≈ 1.4 × 10−5 nsq
m

λ0
lcell

(cid:112)f (GHz).

(13)

This estimate should be considered as an approximate lower
bound as many favorable assumptions were made in its
derivation. For example, the metal traces are assumed to be at
least several skin depths thick, and thinner traces will increase
losses. The current was also assumed to ﬂow uniformly across
the width of the trace, and proximity effects can break this
uniformity and increase losses. We also emphasize that this
loss accounts only for ohmic losses in the copper. Dielectric
losses in the necessary capacitance will increase the total loss.
The weak frequency dependence of this loss bound originates
in the frequency dependence of skin depth.

√

This expression enables the easy computation of a realistic
lower bound on the effective loss of a magnetic metamaterial
due to ohmic losses. For example, let us consider a square
loop composed of 12 squares at 1.5 GHz. Twelve squares is
a small but practical number that results in a copper width
of 25% of the size of the loop from outer edge to outer
edge. At 1.5 GHz, the resistance of this loop is no less than
0.10 ×
1.5=0.123 ohms. For a cubic unit cell (m = 1) and
λ0/lcell = 5 (essentially the minimum for which the loops
can still be have like an effective material), the minimum
achievable permeability loss tangent for planar loops of room
temperature copper is min| tan δ| ≈ 0.001 according to (13).
This can be reduced by packing more loops into a cubic cell
volume, but practical considerations like substrate thickness
may make it difﬁcult to achieve an m greater than 4 or 5.

This expression can also be applied to the fabricated and
measured particle as described in Section V. This is a thin
loop with nsq ≈ 285 according to the dimensions in Figure
2. The dimensions also give A2
loop/Vcell = mlcell = 23.2
mm, or λ0/mlcell = 20.2 at the 640 MHz resonant frequency.
These numbers and (13) yield min| tan δ| ≈ 0.065. This is
approximately 3 times smaller than the measured minimum
permeability loss tangent (consistent with it being a lower
bound). The dielectric losses from the FR4 substrate in be-
tween the capacitor traces are not included in this analysis
and probably produce the difference. Nevertheless, this simple
analytical estimate produces a lower bound not too much
lower than what is measured, conﬁrming that (13) represents
a strong lower bound that is simple to calculate analytically.
We emphasize that the estimate based on the measured Q of
a single particle automatically include both conductive and
dielectric losses, and thus result in a much more accurate loss
tangent estimate.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we showed through full wave numerical sim-
ulations that Qmat of the overall effective material resonant
response is essentially equal to Qpart of the individual resonant
particles that make up the metamaterial. We derived simple
equations for the effective properties of resonant metamaterials
in terms of this quality factor Q of an individual resonator.
These relations enable simple calculations of the Q required
to achieve desired resonant metamaterial effective parameters,
thereby enabling realistic and accurate analytical predictions
of material properties simply from Qpart, which often can an-
alytically estimated or measured from small material samples
or even individual particles. We experimentally demonstrated
this approach by measuring Qpart of a single fabricated
metamaterial particle. This single particle measurement was
used to semi-analytically predict the effective permeability
of a metamaterial slab which was was within 20% and
better agreement with the permeability extracted from a much
more complicated, full S parameter measurement of the slab.
Although derived and validated speciﬁcally for loop-based
magnetic metamaterials, the general design equations apply
equally well to any metamaterial, electric or magnetic, based
on resonant particles.

These design equations were analyzed further to derive
simple, numerical lower bounds on the ohmic losses in planar
magnetic metamaterials. It is shown that the effective magnetic
loss tangent of the such a material depends on the resistance of
the loop, the linear size of the loop relative to wavelength, and
the number of loops per cubic volume in the metamaterial. The
resulting expression is a lower bound on losses in magnetic
is simple to calculate analytically and
metamaterials that
shows that minimum achievable loss tangents are close to
10−3 at frequencies between roughly 100 MHz and 10 GHz,
and that achieving this bound requires thick copper traces for
a loop only a few times smaller than a wavelength. Because
losses vary inversely with the size of the particle relative to a
wavelength for a planar loop magnetic metamaterial, realizing
low losses in such a material with electrically very small
particles may not be possible.

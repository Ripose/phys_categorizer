Abstract: The boundary–value problem of the reﬂection and transmission of a plane wave
due to a slab of an electro–optic structurally chiral material (SCM) is formulated in terms of a
4
4 matrix ordinary diﬀerential equation. The SCM slab can be locally endowed with one of
×
20 classes of point group symmetry, and is subjected to a dc voltage across its thickness. The
enhancement (and, in some cases, the production) of the circular Bragg phenomenon (CBP) by
the application of the dc voltage has either switching or circular–polarization–rejection applica-
tions in optics. The twin possibilities of thinner ﬁlters and electrical manipulation of the CBP,
depending on the local crystallographic class as well as the constitutive parameters of the SCM,
emerge.

Introduction

The Bragg phenomenon is exhibited by a slab of a material whose electromagnetic constitutive
properties are periodically nonhomogeneous in the thickness direction.
Its signature is very
high reﬂectance in a certain wavelength–regime, provided the slab is thick enough to have a
suﬃciently large number of periods. This phenomenon is commonly exploited to make dielectric
mirrors in optics [1, 2].

If the material is isotropic, no dependence of the Bragg phenomenon on the polarization
state of a normally incident electromagnetic wave is evident. The material must be anisotropic
for the Bragg phenomenon to discriminate between two mutually orthogonal polarization states
[3].

Periodicity arises from structural chirality — i.e., a heliocidal variation of anisotropy along
a ﬁxed axis — in cholesteric liquid crystals [4, 5] and chiral sculptured thin ﬁlms [6, 7], which
exemplify structurally chiral materials (SCMs). Both types of SCMs are continuously nonho-
mogeneous in the thickness direction. SCMs can also be piecewise continuous, as proposed
about 140 years ago by Reusch [8] and expanded upon recently by Hodgkinson et al. [9]. As
the periodicity arises from structural chirality, incident electromagnetic plane waves of left–
and right–circular polarization (LCP and RCP) states are reﬂected and transmitted diﬀerently

in the Bragg wavelength–regime, and the Bragg phenomenon is then called the circular Bragg
phenomenon (CBP). Exhibition of the CBP by cholesteric liquid crystals and chiral sculptured
thin ﬁlms underlies their use as circular–polarization rejection ﬁlters in optics [4, 6, 10].

Control of the CBP is very desirable for tuning the Bragg regime as well as for switching
applications. One way would be to use SCMs that are electro–optic, because then the CBP could
be electrically controlled. This possibility, also suggested by the fabrication of electro–optic Sol˘c
ﬁlters [11], was proposed and theoretically examined by us in a recent publication [12]. Therein,
the SCM was assumed to possess locally a ¯42m point group symmetry for the exhibition of the
Pockels eﬀect [14], and the electromagnetic wave was taken to be normally incident on the SCM
slab across whose thickness a low–frequency (or dc) electric ﬁeld was supposed to be applied.
The Pockels eﬀect was found to enhance the CBP [12, 13], so much so that it could engender
the CBP even if that phenomenon were to absent in the absence of a dc electric ﬁeld.

In this paper, we take a comprehensive look at the planewave response characteristics of an
electro–optic SCM slab. The electromagnetic plane wave can be either normally or obliquely
incident. The SCM slab is locally endowed with one of 20 classes of point group symmetry [14]
relevant to the excitation of the Pockels eﬀect by a dc voltage applied across its thickness.

The organization of this paper is as follows: The theoretical formulation is presented in
Section 2, beginning with the optical relative permittivity matrixes of a homogeneous electro–
optic material and a SCM, going on to exploit the Oseen transformation to derive a 4
4 matrix
ordinary diﬀerential equation for electromagnetic propagation in a SCM, then setting up a
boundary–value problem to compute the reﬂectances and transmittances of a SCM slab, and
ﬁnally discussing the salient features of axial propagation in a SCM. Section 3 is devoted to the
presentation and discussion of numerical results. CBP enhancement by the application of the
dc voltage is shown to have either switching or circular–polarization–rejection applications. The
possibilities of thinner ﬁlters and electrical manipulation of the CBP, depending on the local
crystallographic class as well as the constitutive parameters of the SCM, emerge from analysis
for normal incidence.

2 Theoretical formulation

We are interested in the reﬂection and transmission of plane waves due to a SCM slab of
thickness L. The axis of structural chirality of the SCM is designated as the z axis, and the
SCM is subjected to a dc electric ﬁeld Edc = Edc
L are
vacuous. An arbitrarily polarized plane wave is obliquely incident on the SCM from the half–
space z
0
≤
and z
L, respectively. A boundary–value problem has to be solved in order to determine the
reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients.

2.1 Pockels Eﬀect

In order to delineate the electro–optic properties of the chosen SCM, let us ﬁrst consider a
(nondissipative) homogeneous dielectric material susceptible to the Pockels eﬀect when sub-
jected to a dc ﬁeld Edc. The reciprocal of the optical relative permittivity matrix is usually

2.2 Structurally chiral material

As the electro–optic SCM has the z axis as its axis of chiral nonhomogeneity and is subjected
to a dc electric ﬁeld Edc = Edc

2.3 Propagation in a SCM

The Maxwell curl postulates for the chosen SCM are given by

∇ ×

∇ ×

E(x, y, z) = iωµoH(x, y, z)
iωǫo¯ǫSCM (z)

H(x, y, z) =

−
0 < z < L ,

,

E(x, y, z) )

·

where ǫo and µo are the permittivity and the permeability of free space (i.e., vacuum).

As a plane wave is incident obliquely on the SCM,

z we set [16, 17]

E(x, y, z) = e(z) exp [iκ(x cos φ + y sin φ)]

H(x, y, z) = h(z) exp [iκ(x cos φ + y sin φ)] )

,

where the wavenumber κ and the angle φ are determined by the incidence conditions. The
essential part of the Maxwell curl postulates can then be stated in terms of the column vector
[16, 18]

Inside the SCM, it is advantageous to exploit the Oseen transformation [16, 19] by deﬁning

the column vector

For normal incidence, electromagnetic wave propagation in the SCM occurs parallel to the axis
of structural chirality, and a special case amenable to algebraic analysis emerges [22]. Then

Equation (70) indicates that the Bragg regime vanishes for normal incidence on a locally
uniaxial, non–electro–optic SCM with χ = π/2 [25], but can be generated by the appropriate
application of a dc electric ﬁeld if the SCM is electro–optic. This is the generalization of a
result previously obtained for SCMs with local ¯42m point group symmetry [12]. Obviously, this
conclusion may be exploited for optical switching applications for turning on or oﬀ a chosen
circular polarization state.

The foregoing statements may be applied to locally biaxial SCMs as well in the following

manner. Suppose that

2 by virtue of (17). For non–electro–optic SCMs, (71) deﬁnes the pseudoisotropic
point [26, 27]: the Bragg regime for normal incidence vanishes, as may be seen by substituting
(57) and (58) in (60), setting Edc
z = 0 in the resulting expression, and making use of (71) there-
after. However, the Bragg regime can be restored by the application of Edc
z , provided the SCM
is electro–optic; the bandwidth of the Bragg regime can thus be electrically controlled. A gen-
eral expression for (∆λo)Br at the pseudoisotropic point is far too cumbersome for reproduction
here.

3 Numerical results and discussion

A Mathematica program was written to compute the reﬂectances and transmittances of a SCM
slab of thickness L, on which an arbitrarily polarized plane wave is incident from the half–space
z < 0 with an arbitrarily oriented wave vector. The principle of conservation of energy was
veriﬁed to within
0.1% error for all results presented in this section. All calculations were
made for structurally right–handed SCMs.

3.1 Locally isotropic SCMs

1 = ǫ(0)

Locally isotropic SCMs are characterized by ǫ(0)
3 , and therefore cannot evince the
circular Bragg phenomenon in the absence of a dc electric ﬁeld. However, electro–optic materials
of crystallographic classes ¯43m and 23 have r41 = r52 = r63 6
0 [28, pp.
170–176], and can therefore exhibit CBP when Edc
z
Analysis of ¯A′ax reveals that the application of Edc

z would be infructous towards the exhibition
of the CBP for normal incidence (i.e., θ = 0◦), if χ = 45◦; but it would be most (and equally)
eﬀective for χ = 0◦ and χ = 90◦. The analytic continuability of ¯A′(z) with respect to κ

suggests that the foregoing statement would be substantially true even for oblique incidence,
at least for small and moderate values of θ; and the validity of the suggestion was conﬁrmed
computationally.

Figures 1 and 2 help elucidate the eﬀect of the dc electric ﬁeld. The ﬁrst ﬁgure shows the
reﬂectance and transmittance spectrums for the incidence angle θ
z = 0 and
φ = 0◦. The second ﬁgure has the same spectrums but when a dc voltage Vdc = 8 kV is applied
across the planes z = 0 and z = L. The structurally right–handed SCM slab was taken to be
50Ω thick, Ω = 160 nm, χ = 90◦, and its local relative permittivity matrix and electro–optic
parameters were chosen to be the same as of zinc telluride [28, p. 173].

In a

40–nm regime centered at λBr

o = 956 nm, RRR is high and TRR is low when θ = 0◦, in
Fig. 2. This is the Bragg regime, which blueshifts as cos θ decreases from unity in magnitude.
The Bragg regime is entirely absent in Fig. 1 when no dc voltage is applied. The Bragg regime is
also absent in Fig. 2, even when the dc voltage is applied, for incident LCP plane waves. Clearly
therefore, the Pockels eﬀect has engendered the CBP in a SCM with a local crystallographic
symmetry that is isotropic.

The cross–polarized reﬂectances and transmittances in the Bragg regime can be reduced by
a variety of impedance–matching techniques [30], and thereafter the SCM slab can function as
an electrically switchable circular–polarization rejection ﬁlter for incident plane waves of the
same handedness as the SCM.

It is known from many studies on chiral sculptured thin ﬁlms as well as cholesteric liquid
crystals that the CBP ﬁrst deepens and then saturates, as the normalized thickness L/Ω in-
creases [6, 31]. The well–developed CBP manifests itself as a feature with a tall top–hat proﬁle
in the spectrum of RRR (resp. RLL) for normal and near–normal incidence on a structurally
right–handed (resp. left–handed) slab. Further increase of thickness beyond a certain value of
L/Ω is therefore infructous. The same conclusion should hold true for an electro–optic SCM
if Edc
z were held ﬁxed, and is indeed borne out in Fig. 3 by the plot of RRR for a structurally
right–handed SCM slab with other parameters the same as for the previous ﬁgure. This plot
holds at the center–wavelength of the Bragg regime for normal incidence. Figure 3 also suggests
that after a certain value, even an increase in Edc
for a ﬁxed L/2Ω would lead to diminishing
z
returns, if the objective is to maximize RRR.

Electrical control of SCMs appears to require high dc voltages. These can be comparable
with the half–wave voltages of electro–optic materials [32, p. 420], which are often in the 1–
10 kV range. We must also note that the required magnitudes of Edc
z are much smaller than the
characteristic atomic electric ﬁeld strength [14, p. 3]. Similarly high voltages are often applied
to electro–optic ﬁlms, albeit to create electric ﬁelds that are two orders–of–magnitude smaller
than Edc
in Fig. 2 [33]. The possibility of electric breakdown exists, but it would signiﬁcantly
z
depend on the time that the dc voltage would be switched on for.

3.2 Locally uniaxial SCMs

1 = ǫ(0)

Locally uniaxial SCMs are characterized by ǫ(0)
3 . Crystals in 13 classes divided
into the trigonal, tetragonal, and hexagonal families can exhibit the Pockels eﬀect [14]. Lithium
niobate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate are perhaps the most well–known uniaxial electro–
optic materials, but a host of other materials with similar properties also exist [28, pp. 176–201].
Locally uniaxial SCMs should exhibit the CBP even in the absence of a dc electric ﬁeld,
and indeed they do, as is evident from Fig. 4 which shows the reﬂectance and transmittance
z = 0. The chosen SCM has
spectrums for incidence angles θ

[0◦, 90◦) and φ = 0◦ when Edc

trigonal 3m as its local crystallographic class, with the values of the relative permittivity scalars
and the electro–optic coeﬃcients the same as for lithium niobate [28, p. 184]. The plots of RRR
and TRR show the Bragg regime centered about λBr
o = 648 nm when θ = 0◦, the Bragg regime
exhibiting a blueshift with decrease of cos θ. The SCM slab is not very thick (L = 20Ω); hence,
the CBP is not fully developed [6, 31].

Figure 5 has the same reﬂectance and transmittance plots as the preceding ﬁgure, except
that a dc voltage of 5 kV is applied across the SCM slab. The CBP in Fig. 5 is deﬁnitely
enhanced in comparison to Fig. 4; calculated results not presented here indicate even a better
developed CBP in the form of a broad top–hat proﬁle of the RRR–ridge for higher values of Edc
z .
Thus, there are two ways to enhance the CBP for exploitation in circular–polarization rejec-
tion ﬁlters. The ﬁrst is to use thicker SCM slabs, i.e., the ratios L/2Ω are large. The second is
to use higher Vdc. The interplay between these two factors is indicated in Fig. 6, wherein RRR
for normal incidence and λo = 648 nm is plotted as a function of L/2Ω and Edc
z . This ﬁgure
clearly indicates that the exploitation of the Pockels eﬀect will lead to thinner ﬁlters.

Qualitatively comparable results were obtained when the local crystallographic class was

changed from trigonal 3m to any of the other 12 trigonal, tetragonal or hexagonal classes.

Just like their locally uniaxial counterparts, locally biaxial SCMs generally exhibit the CBP
whether or not Edc
z = 0. This is evident from Figs. 7 and 8 which show the reﬂectance and
transmittance spectrums for incidence angles θ
z =
1, respectively. The chosen SCM has orthorhombic mm2 as its local crystallographic
0.67 GV m−
class, with the values of the relative permittivity scalars and the electro–optic coeﬃcients the
same as for potassium niobate [35]. The plots of RRR and TRR in both ﬁgures show the Bragg
regime exhibiting a blueshift with decrease of cos θ. As the SCM slab is not very thick (L = 20Ω),
the CBP is not fully developed when Edc
z = 0, but does exhibit the broad top–hat proﬁle of the
RRR–ridge in Fig. 8 for Edc
= 0. Clearly then, the application of the dc voltage is eﬃcacious
z
in improving the CBP and conﬁrms the conclusion made in Section 3.2 that it would lead to
thinner ﬁlters.
When Edc

z = 0, locally biaxial SCMs can possess a pseudoistropic point deﬁned via ˚dd3,
whose inﬂuence is best seen for normal incidence. For the relative permittivity scalars used
to obtain the plots of Fig. 7, the pseudoisotropic point is identiﬁed by the value χ = 32.28◦.

absent for θ less than at least 60◦ when Edc
z = 0, but is restored in Fig. 10 by the application
of a dc voltage.

3.4 Variation with φ

All plots shown heretofore are for φ = 0◦. In general, there is some eﬀect of φ on the reﬂectance
and transmittance spectrums even in the absence of the Pockels eﬀect, which can be attributed
to the relative orientation of the incident electric ﬁeld einc(0) with the principal components of
the projection of ¯ǫSCM (0) on the plane z = 0 VL98¸

but do not aﬀect the exhibition of the CBP — as may be gleaned from the plots of RRR of a

3.5 Electrical manipulation of the CBP

Several of the spectrums presented clearly show that the Bragg regime not only blueshifts
but also narrows as cos θ decreases, in line with previous reports on non–electro–optic SCMs
[17]. Estimates of the blueshift and narrowing can be obtained from curve–ﬁtting exercises [24]
The case of normal incidence (θ = 0◦) therefore serves as a bellwether for oblique incidence;

19

and

and

the former is also signiﬁcant in its own right, because it represents possibly the most useful
conﬁguration for optics. Therefore, as may be guessed from Section 2.5, it is fortuitous that
closed–form expressions can be derived for important quantities for the normal–incidence case.
In the present context of the manipulation of the CBP by the application of a dc electric ﬁeld,
the two most important quantities are the center–wavelength λBr
and the FWHM bandwidth
(∆λo)Br of the Bragg regime for normal incidence, as deﬁned in ˚Br-def and ˚dBr-def. Let us

which expressions clearly indicate that, if the Pockels eﬀect is not exploited, then

(i) locally isotropic SCMs do not exhibit the CBP for all χ,

(ii) locally uniaxial SCMs do not exhibit the CBP if χ = 90◦, and

(iii) locally biaxial SCMs do not exhibit the CBP if χ satisﬁes the pseudoisotropic condition

˚dd3.

Against this backdrop, the role of the Pockels eﬀect on the CBP can be assessed analytically.

Table 1 shows the dependencies of ǫE, ǫB, and ǫD on χ, for all 20 local crystallographic
classes. In addition, ǫE may be a function of r41, r43, r61, and r63; ǫB of r21, and r23; and ǫD of
r11, r13, r31, r33, r51, and r53. Finally, ǫE, ǫB, and ǫD vary linearly with Edc

Therefore, the center–wavelengths of the Bragg regimes of SCMs of 11 local crystallographic
classes will shift, and the FWHM bandwidths of the same will change, on the application of
moderate dc voltages; whereas those of SCMs of the remaining nine local crystallographic classes
will require the application of higher dc voltages to shift. Furthermore, the Bragg regimes will
either redshift or blueshift, depending on the sign of Edc
z , for the 11 local crystallographic classes;
but the shifts of the Bragg regimes will be insensitive to the sign of Edc
z , for the remaining nine
local crystallographic classes. These conclusions were veriﬁed by comparing the Bragg–regime
spectrums for trigonal 3m, orthorhombic mm2, and tetragonal ¯42m (not shown here) classes.
The eﬀect of the tilt angle χ on the FWHM bandwidth of the Bragg regime for normal

incidence is quite modiﬁed by the application of Edc
follows: When Edc
z

= 0,

I. locally isotropic SCMs do not exhibit the CBP only if χ = 45◦;

II. locally uniaxial SCMs do not exhibit the CBP if χ = 90◦, provided the local crystallo-

graphic class is neither tetragonal ¯4 nor tetragonal ¯42m; and

III. locally biaxial SCMs exhibit the CBP even if χ satisﬁes the pseudoisotropic condition ˚dd3.

When χ = 0◦, the center–wavelength of the Bragg regime does not shift for the following local
crystallographic classes: tetragonal 4mm, hexagonal 6mm, hexagonal ¯6m2, trigonal 3m, and
orthogonal mm2. Likewise, when χ = 90◦, the center–wavelength of the Bragg regime does not
shift for the following local crystallographic classes: tetragonal 422, hexagonal 622, hexagonal
¯6, hexagonal ¯6m2, and trigonal 32.

4 Concluding remarks

×

A comprehensive treatment of the response characteristics of a slab of an electro–optic struc-
turally chiral medium to normally as well as obliquely incident plane waves was undertaken in
this paper. The SCM slab is endowed with one of 20 classes of point group symmetry, and is
subjected to a dc voltage across its thickness. The boundary–value problem was cast in the
4 matrix ordinary diﬀerential equation, whose solution yielded the reﬂectances and
form of a 4
transmittances of the SCM slab. The improvement — and, in some instances, the creation — of
the circular Bragg phenomenon by the application of the dc voltage was theoretically demon-
strated and predicted to have either switching or circular–polarization–rejection applications
in optics. The possibility of thinner ﬁlters and electrical manipulation of the CBP, depending
on the local crystallographic class as well as the constitutive parameters of the SCM, were es-
tablished. This comprehensive study is expected to provide impetus to experimental research,
possibly on ambichiral versions of SCMs [37].

Before concluding, let us contextualize the foregoing work in optics today. SCMs can be
considered to be one–dimensional photonic crystals (PCs). PCs have by now reached a mature
stage of development, with their optical response characteristics well–understood and with many
actual and potential applications [38, 39]. A recent trend concerns tunable or active PCs, whose
optical response characteristics can change by means of some external agent. One way is to
change their structural properties, for instance, by the application of mechanical stress [40, 41].
Another way is to change their electromagnetic constitutive parameters, e.g., by incorporating
the magnetically tunable ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials [42, 43, 44] or by inﬁltrating
a PC with the electrically controllable liquid crystals [45, 46]. We have shown here that the
Pockels eﬀect can be similarly exploited.

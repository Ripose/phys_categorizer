We present the ﬁrst analysis of harmonic generation data where

eV ). We show that, without extending the data outside their range

with the assumption of an a-priori asymptotic behavior,

indepen-

dent truncated dispersion relations connect the real and imaginary

part of the moments of the third harmonic generation susceptibility

ω2αχ(3)(3ω; ω, ω, ω), with α ranging from 0 to 3, in agreement with the

theory, while there is no convergence if we choose α = 4. We repeat

the same analysis for ω2α[χ(3)(3ω; ω, ω, ω)]2 and show that a larger

number of independent K-K relations connect the real and the imag-

inary part of the function under examination. We also compute the

sum rules for the suitable moments of the real and imaginary parts,

and observe that only considering higher powers of the susceptibility

the correct vanishing sum rules are more precisely obeyed. All our re-

sults are in fundamental agreement to recent theoretical ﬁndings. Sum

rules providing explicit information about structural properties of the

material seem to require wider spectral range. These constraints are

expected to hold for any material and provide fundamental tests of

self-consistency that any experimental or model generated data have

to obey; similar tests of coherence can be performed for other nonlinear

optical processes, e.g. pump-and-probe. Veriﬁcation of K-K relations

and sum rules constitute unavoidable benchmarks for any investiga-

tion that addresses the nonlinear response of matter to radiation on a

wide spectral range.

1 Introduction

Kramers-Kr¨onig (K-K) dispersion relations and sum rules[1, 2, 3, 4] have con-

stituted for a long time fundamental tools in the investigation of light-matter

interaction phenomena in condensed matter, gases, molecules, and liquids

because they provide constraints able to check the self-consistency of exper-

imental or model-generated data [5]. In particular these general properties

allow to frame peculiar phenomena related to matter-matter or light-matter

coupling that are very relevant at given frequencies, such as excitonic or po-

laritonic eﬀects in solids[6], in the context of the interaction on the whole

spectral range, showing that their dispersive and absorptive contributions

are connected to all the other contributions in the rest of the spectrum[7].

Moreover by applying K-K relations it is possible to invert optical data, i.e.

acquiring knowledge on dispersive phenomena by measurements over all the

spectrum of absorptive phenomena or viceversa [7, 9]. The conceptual foun-

dations of such general properties, is the principle of causality[10] in the

light-matter interaction, and the Titmarsch’s theorem[11] provides the con-

nection between the mathematical properties of the functions describing the

physics in the time and frequency domains.

In spite of the ever increasing scientiﬁc and technological relevance of op-

tical harmonic generation processes, and in general of nonlinear optical phe-

nomena, relatively little attention has been paid to experimental investigation

of the general properties of the corresponding nonlinear susceptibilities[12,

3

13, 14, 15], because the research has usually focused on achieving high reso-

lution in both experimental data and theoretical calculations. Rapidly devel-

oping technologies of tunable lasers allow to span larger and larger spectral

ranges, so that the experimental investigations of frequency dependent non-

linear optical properties of matter is becoming more and more possible. In

the context of this new class of experiments, K-K relations and sum rules

could provide information on whether or not a coherent, common picture of

the nonlinear properties of the material under investigation is available.

The ﬁrst heuristic applications of K-K theory to nonlinear susceptibilities

date back to the ’60 [16, 17, 18], while a more systematic study has begun

essentially in the last decade. Some authors have preferentially introduced

the K-K in the context of ab-initio or model calculations of materials prop-

erties [19, 20, 21, 22].

Other authors have used a more general approach able to give theoretical

foundations of dispersion theory for nonlinear optics [23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. The

instruments of complex analysis have allowed the deﬁnition of necessary and

suﬃcient conditions for the applicability of K-K relations, which require the

holomophicity of the susceptibility in the upper complex plane of the relevant

frequency variable, given the form of the nonlinear susceptibility descriptive

of the nonlinear phenomena under examination. It has also been shown that

the asymptotic behavior of the nonlinear susceptibility, which can be ob-

tained using the nonlinear Kubo-response function formalism[28], determines

the number of independent pairs of K-K relations that hold simultaneously.

4

In the cases K-K do not hold, other techniques can be applied for the inver-

sion of optical data [2, 29]. Combining K-K relations and knowledge of the

asymptotic behavior of the nonlinear susceptibility sum rules for nonlinear

optics, obtained by other authors by following diﬀerent strategies[30], can be

naturally derived along the same lines of the linear case.

Recent theoretical advances[31, 32] have generalized the results obtained

for the second [27] and third harmonics [33] by showing arbitrary order

harmonic generation susceptibilities χ(n)(nω; ω, · · · , ω) are holomorphic in

the upper complex ω plane, and asymptotically decrease as ω−2n−2; there-

fore K-K relations hold for all the moments ω2αχ(n)(nω; ω, . . . , ω) (from now

on instead of χ(n)(nω; ω, . . . , ω) we use the simpler notation χ(n)(nω)) with

0 ≤ α ≤ n. From these a total of 2n+2 sum rules for the moments of the

real and imaginary part of the susceptibilities can be derived, only one (the

(2n + 1)th of the imaginary part) being diﬀerent from zero and descriptive of

the inner structure of the material under investigation. The previous results

have been recently extended [34] to the wider class of the moments of the

kth powers of harmonic generation susceptibility, which can be written as

ω2α[χ(n)(nω)]k.

In this case K-K relations hold if 0 ≤ α ≤ k(n + 1) − 1,

and therefore a total of 2k(n + 1) − 2 sum rules can be derived, with the

(2k(n + 1) − 1)th moment of imaginary part giving the only nonzero summa-

tion over all the spectrum. The fundamental reason of this results is that if

the harmonic generation susceptibility is holomophic in the upper complex

ω plane, so are its powers. Higher powers of the susceptibility have faster

5

asymptotic decrease, so that the limitations related to the ﬁnite range of real

data are expected to be relaxed: this should be of particular beneﬁt to the

convergence of the sum rules, for which the consideration of the asymptotic

behavior is more critical than for K-K relations [35, 7, 36].

The consideration of anchor points[37, 38] in the unknown part of χ(n)(nω)[39]

is a very promising technique for improving data inversion.

Until now, only in few investigations independent measurements of the real

and imaginary parts of the harmonic generation susceptibilities have been

performed for a relatively wide range[40, 41, 42, 43], and consequently the

veriﬁcation of the coherence of measured data by check of the self-consistency

of K-K relations is still of very limited use[42].

In this paper we present the ﬁrst analysis of harmonic generation data

where the full potential of the generalized nonlinear K-K relations and sum

rules for harmonic generation susceptibilities is exploited. We consider two

published sets of wide spectral range experimental data of third harmonic

generation susceptibility on diﬀerent polymers, the polysilane [42] (frequency

range: 0.4 - 2.5 eV ) and the polythiophene [40] (frequency range: 0.5 - 2.0

eV ).

In section 2 we apply K-K transformations to the real and imaginary part

of the moments of the third harmonic generation susceptibility ω2αχ3(3ω),

with a suitable choices of α, and describe the quality of the data inversion

obtained in this way. We also perform the same analysis for ω2α[χ3(3ω)]2,

in order to prove for the ﬁrst time on experimental data that K-K relations

6

hold also for the powers of the susceptibility, and show how many additional

independent dispersion relations connect the real and the imaginary part.

In section 3 we compute the sum rules for the experimental data, by calculat-

ing the integrals of the suitable moments of the real and imaginary parts of

the susceptibility and of the kth power of the susceptibilities, with 1 ≤ k ≤ 5,

and present a discussion on the issue of their convergence.

In section 4 we present our conclusions.

2 Eﬃcacy of generalized K-K relations for

data inversion

In this study we base our calculations on two published sets of experimental

data on third harmonic generation on polymers, where the real and imagi-

nary part of the susceptibility were independently measured. The ﬁrst data

set refers to measurements taken on polisylane [42] and spans a frequency

range of 0.4 - 2.5 eV. The second data set refers to measurements taken on

polythiophene [40] and spans a frequency range of 0.5 - 2.0 eV.

In this paper we control the self-consistency of the two data sets by observing

the eﬃcacy of the K-K relations in inverting the optical data for the func-

tions ω2α[χ3(3ω; ω, ω, ω)]k, with k=1,2. The theory[31, 32, 33, 34] prescribes

convergence of the dispersion relations:

only if 0 ≤ α ≤ k(n + 1) − 1, therefore in our case of n = 3 K-K relations

should work only if 0 ≤ α ≤ 3 if k = 1 and 0 ≤ α ≤ 7 if we consider

the second power of the susceptibility. In our study we do not assume any

asymptotic behavior outside the data range, but use only the experimental

data, because extrapolation is somewhat arbitrary and in K-K analysis can

be quite problematic [8, 9]; we eﬀectively apply truncated K-K relations and

use a self-consistent procedure.

In the paper by Kishida et al. [42] a check of validity of the K-K relations

was already performed by comparing measured and retrieved χ(3)(3ω). Apart

from the fact that our analysis considers also another data set, the considera-

tion of the moments of the susceptibility is not a mere add-on to the work by

Kishida et al.[42], but it represents a fundamental conceptual improvement:

these additional independent relations are peculiar to the nonlinear phenom-

ena, and provide independent double-checks of the experimental data that

must be obeyed in addition to the conventional K-K relations.

We present in ﬁgures 1 and 2 the results of K-K inversion for respectively

the real and imaginary part of the third harmonic generation susceptibility

data on polysilane. We observe that in both cases the retrieved data obtained

with the choices α = 0, 1 are almost indistinguishable from the experimental

data, while for α = 2 and α = 3, the agreement is quite poor in the lower

8

part of the spectrum: the error induced by the presence of the cut-oﬀ at the

high frequency range becomes more critical in the data inversion for larger α,

since a slower asymptotic decrease is realized. We expect that inverting the

data with the additional information given by anchor points located in the

lower part of the data range these divergences can be cured. However, here

our object is to deal with the worst case i.e. there is no a priori information

about the phase of the complex nonlinear susceptibility at one or more ﬁxed

anchor points (ﬁxed angular frequencies) [39]. From the theory we expect

that for α = 4 no convergence should occur: actually we observe that, while

the main features around 1.1 eV are represented, there is no convergence

at all for lower frequencies; the absence of a clear transition in retrieving

performance between the α = 3 and the α = 4 case is due to the ﬁniteness

of the data range.

In ﬁgures 3 and 4 we show the comparison between retrieved and experi-

mental data of third harmonic generation susceptibility on polythiophene for

the real and imaginary part respectively. The dependence of the accuracy

of quality of data inversion is similar to the previous case: for α = 0, 1 the

agreement is virtually perfect, while for α = 2, 3 we have progressively worse

performance in the low frequency range; anyway the peaks in the imaginary

part are still well reproduced, while the dispersive structures in the real part

are present but shifted towards lower values. In this case the quality of re-

trieved data for α = 4 is more distinct from what obtained with α = 3

than in the previous data set. The inversion with α = 4 presents a notable

9

disagreement in the whole lower half of the data range for both real and

imaginary part, in particular we see that in ﬁgure 3 the dispersive structure

is absent, while the main peak in ﬁgure 4 is essentially missed.

Usually it is likely to expect that only the real or the imaginary part of

the nonlinear susceptibility has been measured. Then normal procedure is

to try data inversion using K-K in order to calculate the missing part.

The results on ﬁgures 1 − 4 conﬁrm that best convergence is obtained

when using conventional K-K, therefore these should generally be used to

obtain a ﬁrst best guess for the inversion of optical data, and should be

used as seed for any self-consistent retrieval procedure; nevertheless if there

is good agreement with the inversions obtained with higher values of α, it

is reasonable to conclude that the dispersion relations provide much more

robust results. In this sense, the two data sets here analyzed are quite good

in terms of self-consistency.

We underline that if on one side considering a higher power of the suscep-

tibility implicitly ﬁlters out noise and errors in the tails of the data, on the

other side experimental errors in the relevant features of the spectrum, peaks

for the imaginary part and dispersive structures for the real part, are greatly

enhanced if higher powers of the susceptibility are considered; in the latter

case consistency between K-K inversion of diﬀerent moments is expected to

be more problematic than in the k = 1 case. Therefore improved convergence

for more moments will occur for the powers of the susceptibility k > 1 only

if the data are basically good.

10

In ﬁgures 5 and 6 we show the results of K-K inversion for respectively the

real and imaginary part of the second power of the third harmonic generation

susceptibility on polysilane. Up to our knowledge this is the ﬁrst analysis

of this kind on experimental data. We observe that for α = 0, 1, 2 the

agreement between experimental and retrieved data is almost perfect, while

it gets progressively worse for increasing α. Nevertheless as long as α ≤ 6 the

main features are well reproduced for both the real and imaginary part and

the retrieved data match well if the photon energy is ≥ 1.0 eV . The theory

predicts convergence for α = 7 and divergence for α = 8: in our analysis we

have divergence also in the former case, and it is reasonable to attribute this

to the cut-oﬀ in the high frequency range of the data, because a very high

moment as the 14th requires a very well deﬁned asymptotic behavior.

In ﬁgures 7 and 8 we repeat the same analysis for the second power of

the susceptibility data taken on the polythiophene: also in this case the

agreement is very good if α = 0, 1, 2, but the narrower frequency range does

not allow the data inversion if the very high moments are considered. If we

consider the real part -ﬁgure 7- for α = 3, 4 K-K data inversion provides a

good reproduction of the experimental data for photon energies ≤ 0.7 eV ;

for α ≥ 5 there is no convergence in the lower half of the spectral range. For

the imaginary part -ﬁgure 8- we can repeat the same observations, except

that for α = 5 there is still good reproduction of the main features of the

curve.

We emphasize that if experimentally only one of the real or imaginary

11

part of the harmonic generation susceptibility has been measured, there is

no direct use of K-K relations relative to higher powers of the susceptibility,

since the multiplication mixes the real and the imaginary parts. Therefore

in this case the K-K relations for k > 1 can be used as tests of robustness of

the results obtained with the dispersion relations applied to the conventional

susceptibility.

3 Veriﬁcation of Sum Rules

Sum rules for optical functions which obey K-K relations can be generally

obtained by combining the dispersion relations with the knowledge of their

asymptotic behavior, which can be obtained with a detailed analysis of the

physics of the system at microscopic level, by applying the superconvergence

theorem [11, 3, 7] to the dispersion relations.

In the case of arbitrary order harmonic generation processes, we have that

for large values of angular frequency χ(n)(nω) ≈ ψω−2n−2 [31, 32], where ψ

is a material-dependent constant. Therefore from the K-K relations (1) and

(2) it is possible to derive the following sum rules [34]:

The veriﬁcation of linear sum rules [3, 4, 5, 7] from experimental data is

usually hard to obtain because of the critical contributions given by the out-

of-range asymptotic part of the real or imaginary part of the susceptibility

under examination [35, 36]; however in the case of linear optics information of

the response of the material to very high frequency radiation can be obtained

with synchrotron radiation [7]. In general a good accuracy in the veriﬁcation

of sum rules is more diﬃcult to achieve than for K-K relations, therefore a

positive outcome of this test provide a very strong argument to support the

quality and the coherence of the experimental data.

In the case of harmonic nonlinear processes the technical limitations for

achieving information for a very wide frequency range are very severe, and

the veriﬁcation of the sum rules is critical, especially for those involving

relatively large values of α which determine a slower asymptotic decrease.

Nevertheless,

if we consider increasing values of k, the integrands in the

equations (3), (4), and (5) have a much faster asymptotic decrease, so that

the missing high-frequency tails tend to become negligible. Therefore we

expect that for a given α the convergence of the sum rules should be more

accurate for higher values of k, if we assume that the main features of the

spectrum are well reproduced by the experimental data, as explained in the

previous section.

13

We ﬁrst focus on the vanishing sum rules (3)-(4).

In order to have a

measure of how precisely the vanishing sum rules are obeyed for the two

experimental data sets under examination, we introduce the dimensionless

quantities Zℜ and Zℑ:

ωmax
ωmin ω2αℜ{[χ(3)(3ω)]k}dω
Zℜ(α, k) = | R
ωmax
ωmin ω2α|ℜ{[χ(3)(3ω)]k}|dω

ωmax
ωmin ω2α+1ℑ{[χ(3)(3ω)]k}dω
Zℑ(α, k) = | R
ωmax
ωmin ω2α+1|ℑ{[χ(3)(3ω)]k}|dω
R

|.

(6)

(7)

Low values of Zℜ(α, k) and Zℑ(α, k) imply that the negative and positive

contributions to the corresponding sum rule cancel out quite precisely com-

pared to their total absolute value. The two data sets of the polymers have

quite diﬀerent performances in the veriﬁcation of these sum rules.

We present in ﬁgures 9 and 10 the results obtained with the data taken

of polysilane by considering 1 ≤ k ≤ 5 for respectively the sum rules of the

real and the imaginary part: we can draw very similar conclusions for both

cases. We see that generally for a given α, we have a better convergence

when a higher k is considered, with a remarkable increase in the accuracy of

the sum rules for k ≥ 3. Consistently with the argument that the speed of

the asymptotic behavior is critical in determining the accuracy of the sum

rule, we also have generally a decrease in the quality of the convergence to

zero when, for a given k, one considers higher moments, thus increasing the

value of α. Particularly impressive is the increase of performance in the

14

convergence of the sum rules of χ(3)(3ω) for both the real (2α = 0, 2, 4, 6)

and the imaginary part (2α + 1 = 1, 3, 5) when we consider k = 4, 5 instead

of k = 1: the values of Zℜ and Zℑ decrease of more than three orders of

magnitude in all cases considered.

In ﬁgures 11 and 12 we present the corresponding results for the experi-

mental data taken of polythiophene. Most of the sum rules computed with

this data set show a very poor convergence to zero, because the correspond-

ing Zℑ and Zℜ are above 10−1; nevertheless we can draw conclusions similar

to the previous case in terms of change of the accuracy of the convergence for

diﬀerent values of k and α; consistently with the relevance of the asymptotic

behavior, the precision increases for increasing k and for decreasing α. But

in this case for a given α the improvement in the convergence of the sum

rules obtained by considering a high value of k instead of k = 1 is generally

small, being in most cases the decrease of Zℑ and Zℜ below or around an

order of magnitude.

We observe that the bias between the performances of the two data sets

in the veriﬁcation of the vanishing sum rules is extremely large, not com-

parable to the discrepancies found in the analysis of the K-K relations. We

can guess that the worse performance of the data on polythiophene can be

mainly attributed to their less complete representation of the relevant non-

linear electronic transitions of the material; as previously stated, the data

extension is critical in the veriﬁcation of sum rules. This result is consistent

with the previously presented slightly worse performance of this data set in

15

the K-K inversion of the second power of χ(3)(3ω), where the relevance of the

out-of-range data is also quite prominent.

Finally, from equation 5 it is possible to obtain a simple relation between

the non vanishing sum rules for [χ(n)(nω)]k and the kth power of the non

vanishing sum rule for the conventional susceptibility χ(n)(nω):

For both of the two data sets considered in our work these relations do not

hold for 1 ≤ k ≤ 5. The equation 8 relates the slowest converging sum rules

for each k, therefore it is reasonable to explain the poor performances of the

experimental data in reproducing this theoretical results with the ﬁnite range

of data under examination.

4 Conclusions

In this study we have performed the ﬁrst thorough analysis of generalized

K-K relations and sum rules on experimental data of third harmonic gener-

ation. We have tested the consistency between the theory and experimental

data in the worst case, which however is usually most typical, namely data

on limited spectral range without extrapolations beyond the measured range,

and without any knowledge of anchor points [37, 38, 39]. We have consid-

ered two data sets of comparable spectral range referring to independent

16

measurements of ℜ{χ(3)(3ω)} and ℑ{χ(3)(3ω)} performed on two polymers,

the polysilane [42], whose data span a frequency range of 0.4 - 2.5 eV and

the polythiophene [40], whose data span a frequency range of 0.5 - 2.0 eV

We have inverted the optical data of the susceptibility using applying

truncated K-K relations with a self-consistent procedure and have veriﬁed

for the ﬁrst time that K-K relations hold consistently also for the moments

of the susceptibility ω2αχ(3)(3ω) with 0 ≤ α ≤ 3, as predicted by the general

theory [31, 32, 33]; the two data sets show very similar performances. The

precision of the data retrieved with K-K relations is good in the upper part of

the spectrum for all moments, while for α = 2, 3 there is a disagreement with

the experimental data in the very low portion of the spectrum, mainly due

to the absence of data descriptive of the asymptotic behavior of the optical

functions; nevertheless the main features of the data are well reproduced by

the dispersion relations. The agreement between the results of the dispersion

relations for the various moments of the susceptibility under examination

provide fundamental information on the robustness of the retrieved data and

on the self-consistency of the experimental data.

We have repeated the same analysis for ω2α[χ(3)(3ω)]2, in order to give the

ﬁrst experimental conﬁrmation of recent theoretical ﬁndings that predict that

K-K relations hold for ω2α[χ(n)(nω)]k with 0 ≤ α ≤ k(n+1)−1, so in our case

dispersions relations connect the real and imaginary part of ω2α[χ(3)(3ω)]2

if 0 ≤ α ≤ 7. We have found that for the experimental third harmonic

susceptibility measured on polysilane K-K relations hold with a high degree

17

of precision for all the functions ω2α[χ(3)(3ω)]2 with 0 ≤ α ≤ 6; the agreement

between retrieved and experimental data is excellent for 0 ≤ α ≤ 2. In the

case of polythiophene data, we can present similar conclusions, except that

the agreement exists only for 0 ≤ α ≤ 5. The disagreement between the

theory and the experimental fact can be safely attributed to the truncation

occurring in the high frequency range, which mostly aﬀects the convergence

of the dispersion relations of the very high moments. K-K relations for higher

powers of the susceptibility cannot be directly applied if measures on only

one part of the susceptibility are available, but provide additional tests that

inform on the completeness and self-consistency of measured and retrieved

data.

We have investigated the validity of the sum rules that can be derived

by combining the knowledge of the asymptotic behavior of χ(3)(3ω) with the

previously described sets of K-K relations for the moments of χ(3)(3ω) and

of its powers. The theory predicts that the integration in the semi-inﬁnite

positive ω-domain of each even moments of the real part of the kth power

of χ(n)(nω) up to the (2k(n + 1) − 2)th gives 0, and the same holds for the

odd moments of the imaginary part of the kth power of the susceptibility up

to the (2k(n + 1) − 3)th; the only nonvanishing sum rule is the given by the

integration of the (2k(n + 1) − 1)th moment of the imaginary part. In our

case we have considered all the powers of χ(3)(3ω) up to the ﬁfth.

In order to evaluate the performance of the sum rules that the theory

predicts to be vanishing, we have introduced an dimensionless measure of

18

how precisely a sum rule computed on the experimental data converges to

zero. Generally, for both the sum rules of the real and of the imaginary part,

for a given α, the convergence improves if we consider a higher value of k.

Moreover, a decrease in the precision of the sum rules is realized if for a given

k, higher moments are considered. The main reason for this behavior is in

the concept that the faster the asymptotic decrease of the integrand of the

sum rule under examination, the smaller the error due to the high-frequency

cut-oﬀ. The two data sets for polymers diﬀer greatly in the precision achieved

in the veriﬁcation of the sum rules, in many correspondent cases the polysi-

lane data provide results that are better by orders of magnitude. The main

reason for this discrepancy, much more relevant but coherent with the results

obtained in the K-K study of [χ(3)(3ω)]2, is the much stronger dependence of

the sum rules precision on the position of high frequency range experimental

cut-oﬀ relative to the saturation of the electronic transitions of the material:

it is likely that the data on polythiophene are, apart from being narrower in

absolute terms, less comprehensive relatively to the electronic properties of

the material.

On the contrary, the experimental data on both polymers do not verify

the non vanishing sum rules, which the theory predicts to give information

about the structure of the material, because they do not obey the newly

established consistency relation (8) which should hold for each value of the

power k considered for the susceptibility. The non vanishing sum rules involve

the highest moments for which the integrations converge, therefore they are

19

most strongly aﬀected by the frequency range ﬁniteness; improvements on

the data range are then necessary to expect to obtain veriﬁcation of these

sum rules.

The constraints here analyzed are in principle universal, since they es-

sentially derive from the principle of causality in the response of the matter

to the external radiation, and so are expected to hold for any material; they

provide fundamental tests of self-consistency that any experimental or model

generated data have to obey; similar tests of coherence can be performed for

other nonlinear optical processes, e.g. pump-and-probe[2, 13, 26, 44]. Veriﬁ-

cation of K-K relations and sum rules constitute unavoidable benchmarks for

any investigation that addresses the nonlinear response of matter to radiation

on a wide spectral range.

The eﬃciency of evanescent coupling between a silica optical ﬁber taper and a silicon photonic
crystal waveguide is studied. A high reﬂectivity mirror on the end of the photonic crystal waveguide
is used to recollect, in the backwards propagating ﬁber mode, the optical power that is initially
coupled into the photonic crystal waveguide. An outcoupled power in the backward propagating
ﬁber mode of 88% of the input power is measured, corresponding to a lower bound on the coupler
eﬃciency of 94%.

Evanescent coupling between optical ﬁber tapers[1]
and photonic crystal waveguides (PCWG)[2, 3] allows
highly eﬃcient and mode selective interfacing between
ﬁber optics and planar photonic crystal devices. Cir-
cumventing the intrinsic spatial and refractive index mis-
match of ﬁber to PCWG end-ﬁre coupling[4], this cou-
pling scheme takes advantage of the strong dispersion
and undercut geometry inherent to PC membrane struc-
tures to enable eﬃcient power transfer between modes of
a PCWG and a ﬁber taper. The coherent interaction
over the length of the coupling region between phase
matched modes of each waveguide manifests in nearly
complete resonant power transfer between waveguides,
and by varying the position of the ﬁber taper it is pos-
sible to tune the coupling strength and phase matching
frequency, allowing the dispersive and spatial properties
of PCWG modes to be eﬃciently probed[5].

In previous work[2, 5], the coupling eﬃciency of this
technique was studied by analyzing the signal transmit-
ted through the ﬁber taper as a function of wavelength
and ﬁber taper position. Although transmission mea-
surements are suﬃcient to infer the eﬃciency of this cou-
pling scheme, a measurement of power coupled into and
then back out of a PCWG is of interest since it allows
the lower bound of the input-output coupling eﬃciency
to be directly established. By studying light which is
coupled into a PCWG, reﬂected by an end-mirror at the
PCWG termination, and then coupled into the backward
propagating ﬁber mode, we show in this letter that this
coupling scheme has near unity eﬃciency.

Figure 1(a) shows an illustration of the ﬁber taper
evanescent coupling scheme. A ﬁber taper, formed by
simultaneously heating and stretching a standard single
mode ﬁber until it has a minimum diameter of roughly
a micron, is positioned above and parallel to an under-
cut planar PCWG. The small diameter of the ﬁber taper
allows the evanescent tail of its fundamental mode to in-
teract with the PCWG, while the undercut geometry of
the PCWG prevents the ﬁber taper from radiating into
the PC substrate. A schematic detailing the optical path
within the ﬁber taper and the PCWG is shown in Fig-
ure 1(b). To spectrally characterize the taper-PCWG
coupler, an external cavity swept wavelength source with
wavelength range 1565 nm - 1625 nm was connected to

the ﬁber taper input. At the ﬁber taper output, a pho-
todetector (DT) was connected to measure the transmit-
ted power past the taper-PCWG coupling region. An
additional photodetector (DR) was connected to the sec-
ond 3dB coupler input to measure the light reﬂected by
the PCWG.

The PCWGs used in this work were fabricated from a
silicon-on-isulator (SOI) wafer. The air holes were pat-
terned in the 300 nm thick silicon (Si) layer using stan-
dard electron-beam lithography and dry etching tech-
niques, after which the suspended membrane structure

was created by selectively removing the 2 µm thick un-
derlying silicon dioxide layer using a hydorﬂuoric acid wet
etch. The PCWGs were formed by introducing a grade in
hole radius along the transverse direction of a compressed
square lattice of air holes[6], as shown by Figure 2(a-b).
Coupling in this case occurs between the fundamental lin-
early polarized ﬁber mode and the TE-1 PCWG mode,
whose ﬁeld proﬁle is shown in Fig. 3(a). This PCWG
mode has a negative group velocity, resulting in con-
tradirectional coupling as depicted in Figure 1, and was
designed to be integrated with recently demonstrated[7]
high-Q cavites formed using a similar grading in hole ra-
dius.

Λz = 536 nm, and length L = 200Λz. (c) Dispersion of the

In previous studies of evanescent coupling to such
PCWGs[5], the waveguide termination consisted of a 2
µm region of undercut Si, followed by an 8 µm length
of non-undercut SOI and a ﬁnal air interface. The in-
terference from multiple reﬂections at the three inter-
faces within the waveguide termination resulted in a
highly wavelength dependent reﬂection coeﬃcient, mak-
ing quantitative analysis of signals reﬂected by the
PCWG diﬃcult. Here, the waveguide terminations were
engineered to have either high or low broadband reﬂec-
tivities. On one end of the PCWG, shown in Figure
2(b), a photonic crystal mirror with high modal reﬂec-
tivity (r1) for the TE-1 PCWG mode was used. This
high reﬂectivity end mirror was formed by removing the
lattice compression of the waveguide while maintaining
the transverse grade in hole radius. The change in lat-
tice compression results in the TE-1 PCWG mode lying
within the partial bandgap[6] of the high reﬂectivity end
mirror section (Figure 2(c)), while the transverse grade
in hole radius reduces diﬀraction loss within the mirror.

On the opposite end of the PCWG, a poor reﬂector with
low reﬂectivity (r2) was realized by removing (over sev-
eral lattice constants) the transverse grade in hole radius
while keeping the central waveguide hole radius ﬁxed,
resulting in a loss of transverse waveguiding within the
end mirror section and allowing the TE-1 PCWG mode
to diﬀract into the unguided bulk modes of the PC.

Figure 1(b), non-zero r1,2 introduce feedback into the

1 PCWG mode to be partially reﬂected by the PCWG
termination, and subsequently coupled to the backward
propagating fundamental ﬁber taper mode. In the pres-
ence of this feedback within the PCWG, the normalized
reﬂected and transmitted powers in the ﬁber taper are

In the measurements presented here a ﬁber taper with
2 µm diameter was used to probe the PCWG of Figure
2(b). Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show T and R as a func-
tion of wavelength when the taper is aligned with the
PCWG at a height of g = 0.20 µm, and indicate that the

phase-matched wavelength is λ
scribed in Ref. [5], coupling to the guided TE-1 mode of
the PCWG was conﬁrmed by studying the coupling de-
pendence upon polarization, lateral taper displacement,
and ﬁber taper diameter. Figure 3(c) shows T and R at
the resonant wavelength of the PCWG nearest the phase-
matching condition (the minima and maxima in T (λ) and
R(λ)), as a function of taper height g above the PCWG.
Included in Figure 3(c) is the oﬀ-resonant (away from
phase-matching) transmission, Toﬀ, through the ﬁber. A
maximum normalized reﬂected power Rmax
0.88 was
measured at a height of g
0.25 µm, where the corre-

sponding transmission was T < 0.01. As can be seen in

the wavelength scans of Figure 3(a), at this taper height
the Fabry-Perot resonances due to multiple reﬂections
from the end mirrors of the PCWG are suppressed for
wavelengths within the coupler bandwidth due to strong
coupling to the ﬁber taper. Ignoring for the moment the
eﬀects of multiple reﬂections in eq. 3, the maximum opti-

where the square root dependence upon Rmax is a result
of the light passing through the coupler twice in return-
ing to the backward propagating ﬁber mode. Assuming
the high reﬂectivity mirror is perfect (unity reﬂection),
for the measured Rmax = 0.88 this implies 94% coupling
of optical power from taper to PC waveguide (and vice-
versa).

By further comparison of T (g) and R(g) with the
model given above, this time including feedback within
the PCWG, we ﬁnd that the high reﬂectivity PCWG end-
mirror is imperfect and that Rmax is in fact limited by
mirror reﬂectivity, not the eﬃciency of the coupling junc-

are constants. Substituting these relations into eqs. (2)
and (3), T and R can be ﬁt to the experimental data
with r1,2, κ⊥,0 and g0 as free parameters[10]. Note that
waveguide loss can also be included in the model, however
it is found to be small compared to the mirror loss and
will be studied in detail elsewhere. Figure 3(c) shows the
ﬁts to the data for g
0.20 µm; for g < 0.20 µm non-
resonant scattering loss is no longer negligible and the
ideal coupling junction model breaks down. Note that
the oﬀ-resonant scattering loss is observed to eﬀect the
reﬂected signal at a smaller taper-PCWG gap than for
the transmitted signal, indicating that within the coupler
bandwidth 1
Toﬀ is an overestimate of the amount of
power scattered into radiation modes. From the ﬁts in

In conclusion, these results indicate that this coupling
scheme allows highly eﬃcient input and output coupling
between photonic crystal devices and ﬁber tapers, and is
promising for eﬃcient probing of future integrated planar
PC devices.

Abstract

Optical second harmonic generation (SHG) is used as a noninvasive probe of two-

dimensional (2D) ferroelectricity in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) ﬁlms of copolymer

vinylidene ﬂuoride with triﬂuorethylene. The surface 2D ferroelectric-paraelectric

phase transition in the topmost layer of LB ﬁlms and a thickness independent (al-

most 2D) transition in the bulk of these ﬁlms are observed in temperature studies of

SHG.

The role of dimensionality in phase transitions and ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism

has been one of the central points of basic theoretical and experimental studies for decades1.

Signiﬁcant progress in the experimental studies of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic systems

has been achieved with molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) fabrication of magnetic monolayers2.

In contrast to 2D magnetic materials, serious technological problems still remain in the

fabrication of ultrathin ferroelectric ﬁlms, even in the case of MBE. It has appeared recently

that the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique is more successful than MBE in preparation of

ultrathin ferroelectric ﬁlms3. In principle, the LB technique has been well-known for decades

as a method of fabrication of artiﬁcially ordered structures. The LB method was successfully

used for preparation of noncentrosymmetric and polar ﬁlms with perspective pyroelectric4,

electro-optical5, and nonlinear optical properties6. Moreover, in the early 1970’s magnetic

monolayers were fabricated by LB techniques7.

The ﬁrst ferroelectric LB ﬁlms based on poly-vinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) have been
prepared in the very late 1990’s3,8–10. Recent results show that ultrathin LB ﬁlms consisting

of a few monolayers of this polymer behave as 2D ferroelectrics7,10. The LB technique has

opened a new experimental chapter in 2D ferroelectricity which has previously only been

discussed theoretically.

As for experimental studies, up to now ferroelectric properties of these 2D structures were

investigated by traditional measurements of dielectric parameters. These methods usually

entail the deposition of a cap electrode on top of a delicate layered structure consisting

of only a few (or in the extreme case, a single) polymer monolayers. As a result of this,

a question always arises how non-invasive such a deposition is and how undisturbed and

reliable these measurements are.

Optical second harmonic generation (SHG) has been shown to be a rather simple, non-

invasive and informative probe to study the structure, symmetry and morphology of inter-

faces and ultrathin (down to monolayers) ﬁlms11,12. This advantage of SHG stems from

its unique sensitivity to the breakdown of crystallographic symmetry11. In turn, this high

sensitivity of SHG arises from the symmetry selection rules for the second-order susceptibil-

2

ity: in the dipole approximation, SHG is strongly forbidden in the bulk of centrosymmetric

materials12, being allowed for structures with a lack of inversion symmetry. For example, the

application of DC-electric ﬁeld breaks down the inversion symmetry of centrosymmetric ma-

terials. As a consequence, DC-electric ﬁeld induced SHG (EFISH) is allowed13 and recently

EFISH generation has been shown as a promising probe of the Si-SiO2 buried interfaces

in MOS structures14. By analogy with external DC-electric ﬁeld, a spontaneous polariza-

tion in ferroelectrics breaks down the inversion symmetry and produces dipole second-order

susceptibility which is the source of strong dipole SHG. Thus, on the one hand, SHG is

a very sensitive probe of ferroelectricity and ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions, as

the symmetry of a material changes from a centrosymmetric to a noncentrosymmetric type

as spontaneous polarization appears. On the other hand, this is an electrode-free method

which is non-invasive for ultrathin ﬁlms. An electrode-free SHG probe of ferroelectric phase

transition in the micron-thick ﬁlms of PZT ceramics has been discussed in Ref.15.

In this paper, the ferroelectric properties and ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition

are studied in ultrathin electrode-free PVDF LB ﬁlms by means of a temperature-dependent

SHG.

Ferroelectric LB ﬁlms composed from the copolymer vinylidene ﬂuoride with triﬂuorethy-

lene (P(VDF-TrFE)(70:30 mol %)) were deposited onto a fused quartz substrate by hori-

zontal Langmuir lift (Langmuir-Schaeﬀer method). The thickness of a single monolayer of

P(VDF-TrFE) LB ﬁlm is approximately 0.5 nm. The 15-monolayer-thick and 60-monolayer-

thick LB ﬁlms were studied.

For the SHG measurements the output of a Q-switched YAG:Nd3+ laser at a wavelength

of 1064-nm was used with a pulse duration of 15 ns, a repetition rate of 12.5 Hz, and

an intensity of 1 MW/cm2 focused onto a spot approximately 0.5 mm in diameter at an

angle of incidence of 450. A ﬂuency of the fundamental radiation is small enough to avoid

laser damage of the samples and was checked not to lead to undesirable photo-induced

changes in the ﬁlms. The SHG signal generated by the samples on reﬂection is selected

by a monochromator and detected by a PMT with an angular aperture of the detection

3

system of approximately 10−1 sr and gated electronics. The s-in, s-out and p-in, p-plus-s-

out combinations of polarization of the fundamental and second harmonic (SH) waves were

studied. The temperature of the LB ﬁlms placed into the cryostat was varied in the range

from -30oC up to 120oC.

To characterise the general nonlinear optical properties of ultrathin ferroelectric LB

ﬁlms the azimuthal anisotropy of the SHG intensity was studied. The top-left panel in

Figure 1 shows the dependence of the s-in, s-out SHG intensity on the azimuthal angle for a

15-monolayer-thick P(VDF-TrFE) LB ﬁlm. An azimuthal angular dependence of the SHG

output reveals an anisotropic component which possesses a distinct two-fold symmetry riding

on an isotropic background. The former is related to a coherent SHG and is consistent with

the presence of a predominant in-plane direction in the ﬁlm symmetry. This predominant

direction can be attributed to a well ordered structure of oriented polymer chains in LB

monolayers which was observed previously for the same LB ﬁlms by STM3. The latter is

associated with an incoherent SHG (the so-called hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS)) and is

caused by random inhomogeneity of spatial distribution of linear and non- linear optical

parameters of LB ﬁlms17. Speciﬁc features of HRS from thin inhomogeneous ﬁlms has been

discussed in details in recent papers17,18 and in further presentation of our results we will

not distinguish between a coherent and incoherent SHG. Thus, in the measurements of the

SHG temperature dependence the azimuthal angle of the sample was set at the maximum

of an anisotropy of the SHG intensity. To collect the depolarized and diﬀuse SHG radiation,

the p-in, p-plus-s-out combination was chosen and the SHG output was integrated over an

angular aperture of a detection system.

Figure 1 (main panel) shows the temperature dependence of the SHG intensity for a 60-

monolayer-thick P(VDF-TrFE) LB ﬁlm in the temperature range from -10oC up to 120oC.

The arrows in Fig.1 show the direction of the variation of temperature. Two speciﬁc ranges

in the SHG temperature dependence could be marked out which are separated from each

other at approximately 30oC-35oC. As the temperature is decreased in the ﬁrst range, the

dependence of the SHG intensity below 30oC reveals a pronounced peak at approximately

4

28oC and a further monotonic increase of the nonlinear response with the ﬁnal saturation

regime of the SHG signal below 10oC. The ratio of the saturated SHG signal with respect

to the room-temperature SHG intensity is approximately 3±0.5. Heating above 35oC (in

the second speciﬁc range) shows a slightly changing SHG signal with a shallow minimum in

the vicinity of 70oC and a gradual increase of the nonlinear response until approximately

100oC where saturation occurs. The ratio of the saturated SHG signal with respect to the

room-temperature SHG is approximately 6±1. Cooling the sample in the second speciﬁc

range brings about a broad and strong hysteresis loop of the nonlinear response with a

maximum of the SHG intensity at approximately 50oC. Similar features were observed in

the temperature dependence of the SHG intensity from a 15-monolayer-thick P(VDF-TrFE)

LB ﬁlm.

These speciﬁc features of the SHG temperature dependence for both temperature ranges

can be considered in terms of an existence of the ferroelectric- paraelectric phase transi-

tions. It has been observed recently that P(VDF-TrFE) LB ﬁlms reveal two types of 2D

ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition3,10. The ﬁrst one is a phase transition with a

thickness independent Curie temperature TB
c

in the vicinity of 80oC and is related to a 3D

ferroelectric state of a bulk P(VDF-TrFE) material19. This transition possesses an unusu-

ally wide temperature hysteresis of the dielectric constant, which shows a signiﬁcant increase

on the cooling branch of the hysteresis loop (see the top-right panel in Fig. 1.). The sec-

ond ﬁrst-order phase transition is observed at a Curier temperature TS

c of approximately

20oC. This transition is attributed to a ferroelectric ordering in the topmost surface layer

of multilayered LB structures of P(VDF-TrFE) and has no analog in the 3D P(VDF-TrFE)

material.

For a qualitative description of the temperature dependence of the SHG intensity in

P(VDF-TrFE) LB ﬁlms, we consider a nonlinear-optical model of the ferroelectric LB struc-

ture shown in the top panel of Fig. 2. This model structure involves the non-linear optical

sources located at the two (air-LB and LB-substrate) interfaces and in the ”bulk” of the LB

ﬁlm. The mid panel in Fig. 2 shows schematically the model temperature dependences for

5

the surface susceptibilities and their interference. The Curie temperatures, TS1

c and TS2
c ,

of ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions in interfacial layers are slightly diﬀerent, being

in the vicinity of 20oC, and the temperature dependent surface dipole susceptibilities of

second order, χ(2),S1(T) and χ(2),S2(T), have diﬀerent absolute values. In the paraelectric

phase these surface susceptibilities originate from discontinuity of the structure in the nor-

mal direction and are temperature independent11. The phase shift between these surface

susceptibilities is supposed to be close to π because of the opposite orientations of the normal

to these interfaces.

The nonlinear optical properties of the bulk of ferroelectric LB ﬁlms are described by two,

dipole and quadrupole, bulk susceptibilities. The bottom panel in Fig. 2 shows a schematic

of the model temperature dependences for the bulk susceptibilities and their interference.

The dipole susceptibility, χ(2),B(T), is temperature dependent and exists only below the

bulk Curie temperature, TB

c , in the vicinity of 80oC. The quadruple susceptibility, χ(2),Q, is

temperature independent, in the ﬁrst approximation, and its phase is supposed to be shifted

by π with respect to the dipole bulk susceptibility, χ(2),B(T).

The consideration of both the bulk dipole and quadruple, contributions and their com-

parison is not as meaningless as it could appear at ﬁrst glance. SHG studies of LB ﬁlms

of large molecules such as fullerene18 do show a signiﬁcant role of the nonlocal quadruple

contribution to a quadratic response of thin ﬁlms.

The SHG intensity in our model is given by the following combination of quadratic

nonlinear polarizations of components of a planar structure, shown in Figure 2:

I2ω(T ) ∝ [P D,S1

2ω

(T ) + P D,S2

(T )]2 + [P D,bulk

(T ) + P Q,bulk

(T )]2

2ω

(1)

where the interference of two surface, and two bulk contributions to the SH ﬁeld is taken

into account. This model ignores the temperature dependence of linear Fresnel factors, the

propagation factors (Grin’s functions), a multiple reﬂection interference which gives a phase

shift between interfering SH waves, and cross-interference of surface and bulk nonlinear

polarization terms, which, in principle, should be considered in a more general model.

6

An interpretation of the results of the SHG experiments is based on qualitatively com-

paring the features of experimental SHG temperature dependences and the SHG intensity

behaviour in the interference model summarised in Eq. 1. The interference of nonlinear

polarizations of surface ferroelectric layers and their temperature dependence under sur-

face ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions can give a peak in the SHG intensity in the

vicinity of 20oC and a gradual increase and saturation in the SHG intensity for the low-

temperature range (T < 30oC) (see mid panel in Fig. 2).

increase of the SHG intensity in the vicinity of 80oC and, as a consequence, an increase of the

absolute value of the bulk dipole quadratic susceptibility is not clear. On the other hand,

this behaviour can be referred to an analogous hysteresis behaviour of the linear (static)

dielectric constant measured in Ref.3 and presented at the top right panel in Fig. 1.

In summary, an electrode-free method of optical SHG is used to study the 2D

ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions in LB ﬁlms of P(VDF-TrFE). Temperature depen-

dence of the SHG intensity reveals two phase transitions: 2D ferroelectric phase transition

in the interfacial (topmost) layer of the LB ﬁlm and a thickness independent (almost 2D)

ferroelectric phase transition in the bulk of the LB ﬁlms.

Catastrophes are at the heart of many fascinat-
ing optical phenomena1. The rainbow1, for ex-
ample, is a ray catastrophe where light rays be-
come inﬁnitely intense. The wave nature of light
resolves the inﬁnities of ray catastrophes1 while
drawing delicate interference patterns such as the
supernumerary arcs of the rainbow1. Black holes2
cause wave singularities. Waves oscillate with in-
ﬁnitely small wave lengths at the event horizon2
where time stands still. The quantum nature of
light evades this higher level of catastrophic be-
haviour while producing a quantum phenomenon
known as Hawking radiation3. As this letter de-
scribes, light brought to a standstill in laboratory
experiments4,5,6 can suﬀer a similar wave singu-
larity caused by a parabolic proﬁle of the group
velocity7. In turn, the quantum vacuum is forced
to create photon pairs with a characteristic spec-
trum. The idea may initiate a theory of quantum
catastrophes, in addition to classical catastrophe
theory8,9, and the proposed experiment may lead
to the ﬁrst direct observation of a phenomenon
related to Hawking radiation3.

Optical media govern the propagation of light. Media
are transparent substances such as glass or water, but
empty yet curved space is a medium as well10. One can
manipulate certain material media to give them extraor-
dinary optical properties. Inside such media light may
propagate with a negative11 or very low12 group velocity7
or light may be completely frozen4,5,6.
In a medium
with Electromagnetically-Induced Transparency13 (EIT)
an external control beam dictates the group velocity vg
of a second and weaker probe beam to slow down the
probe light4,5,6,12. Once the ﬁrst beam has gained con-
trol, the group velocity of the second one is essentially
proportional to the control intensity Ic, even in the limit
when Ic vanishes14.

Z

Imagine that the control beam illuminates the EIT
medium from above. Initially, the control intensity is uni-
form, but then the control light develops a dark stripe.
The stripe shall continue down through the medium as an
interface
of zero intensity Ic where, consequently, the
group velocity of any potential probe light vanishes. In
the following we show theoretically that the interface
Z
forms the optical analog of an event horizon. The forma-
tion of the horizon should trigger a quantum catastrophe
that results in a continuous emission of slow-light quanta
out of the vacuum. First we analyze classical waves of
slow light and then we turn to the quantum theory.

FIG. 1. Schematic diagram of the proposed experiment.
A beam of control light with intensity Ic generates Electro-
magnetically-Induced Transparency13 in a medium, strongly
modifying its optical properties for a second ﬁeld of slow light.
When an initially uniform control intensity is turned into the
parabolic proﬁle shown in the ﬁgure, the slow-light ﬁeld suf-
fers a quantum catastrophe. To slow-light waves, the interface
Z of zero control intensity cuts space into two disconnected
regions and creates a logarithmic phase singularity, in analogy
to the eﬀect18 of an event horizon2. The quantum vacuum of
slow light cannot occupy such catastrophic waves. In turn,
pairs of slow-light quanta, propagating in opposite directions
away from Z, are emitted with a characteristic spectrum. The
waves shown below the intensity proﬁle refer to the emitted
light with the modes wR and wL of Eq. (7).

Z

Assume that the interface

of zero control intensity
Ic is suﬃciently ﬂat such that the optical properties gen-
erated do not vary much in the spatial directions parallel
to
. Over a small
fraction of a characteristic length a, the group-velocity
proﬁle of the slow probe light is parabolic,

. Consider a line z orthogonal to

because Ic increases quadratically in the vicinity of a
zero. As usual, c denotes the speed of light in vacuum.
For simplicity we concentrate on slow-light waves ϕ(t, z)
that propagate in z direction only and we ignore their
polarizations.

FIG. 2. Physics behind Electromagnetically-Induced
Transparency13 (EIT). The ﬁgure shows the relevant energy
levels of each atom constituting the EIT medium. The control
light couples two excited states | 2 i and | 3 i and thus inﬂu-
ences the optical transition between the ground state | 1 i and
the level | 3 i brought about by the probe light. Initially, the
control light, being suﬃciently strong, prepares each atom
in a pure state | ψ i called a dark state13,14. When the con-
trol and probe ﬁeld strengths vary the atoms remain in dark
states as long as level | 3 i is not suﬃciently populated. Up to
a normalization and phase factor, the dark state | ψ i is pro-
portional to | 1 i − (Ωp/Ωc) | 2 i + 2(N 2
c ) i∂(Ωp/Ωc)/∂t | 3 i
−2
0 = 1 + | Ωp/Ωc |2, described here in an interaction
with N
picture with respect to the atomic transition frequencies ω32
and ω31 = ω0. The ﬁeld strengths of the probe and control
light are given in terms of the local Rabi frequencies22 Ωp and
Ωc. The induced dipole moments of the atoms in dark states
generate a matter polarization that inﬂuences the propaga-
tion of the probe light. When | Ωp |2 is much less than | Ωc |2
the probe light obeys the linear wave equation (2) with a
group index15 α = c/vg − 1 that is inversely proportional14
to | Ωc |2. The less intense the control ﬁeld is the lower is the
group velocity vg. When | Ωp |2 is comparable with | Ωc |2 or
larger non-linear optical eﬀects occur.

To predict the propagation properties of slow light we
may use the speciﬁc physics of EIT illustrated in ﬁg-
ure 2. Equivalently and more generally, we translate the
phenomenological dispersion relation15 of slow light with
frequencies close to the EIT-resonance ω0 into a wave
equation that is subject to the principle of least action of
the canonical formalism16,

As a consequence, slow light propagates independently
and can never cross
on the two sides of the interface
, because, in mathematical terms, we can multiply any
Z
solution ϕ with the step function Θ(
z) and still solve
we can de-
the wave equation (2). On either side of
compose a slow-light pulse into monochromatic waves,
i.e. into stationary solutions of the wave equation (2)

Close to
the slow-light intensity falls with falling dis-
tance z and the phase µ ln(kz) becomes inﬁnite, causing
the light to oscillate with linearly decreasing wave length7
. We regard
(2π/µ)z. Waves freeze near the interface
a process that creates an interface where waves separate
and develop a logarithmic phase singularity18 as a wave
catastrophe.

Z

Close to the event horizon of a black hole2 an outside
observer would see a similar behavior of waves19. The
horizon cuts space into two disconnected parts. All mo-
tion freezes near the horizon where time seems to stand
still. Waves develop a logarithmic phase singularity. Yet
an observer falling inwards could pass the horizon with-
out noticing anything unusual. This characteristic dif-
ference in perception has a profound consequence, be-
cause the quantum vacuum behaves similar to a ﬂuid
that shares the fate of the inward-falling observer19−21.
Consequently, the quantum vacuum must not occupy the
waves seen by the outside observer. In other words, this
observer does not see a vacuum. Instead, the observer
detects the quanta of Hawking radiation3,19.

Consider the quantum physics of our wave catastro-
phe. According to quantum ﬁeld theory16, waves are
potential particle carriers called modes. Modes describe
the spatial-temporal ﬁelds of single quanta and, there-
fore, they are normalized with respect to a characteristic
scalar product20. We normalize the waves (4) with imag-
inary index (5) to ﬁnd the set of modes

We have chosen the w modes such that they appear as
outgoing plane waves far away from

modes that carry detectable quanta.

Z

Complex analysis18 is an imaginative mathematical
method to understand real physics. Regard hypotheti-
cally the distance z and the time t as complex variables18.
The modes (7) are non-analytic functions18 of z, because
they vanish18 on one of the sides of the horizon. How-
ever, the quantum vacuum should occupy a set of ana-
lytic modes, for the following reason: The formation of
the horizon is a dynamic process14. Initially, the quan-
tum vacuum occupies analytic modes such as packets of
plane waves. The process conserves the analyticity in z,
even after the wave catastrophe has occurred. Further-
more, the light waves are analytic on the lower half of
the complex t plane on at least one side of the horizon.
One can prove that at any arbitrary time t0 after the
catastrophe the vacuum modes are certain combinations
of the detector modes,

supplemented with analogous formulas where R and

complex-conjugated w modes with negative frequencies
and hence negative energies. This is the decisive sign of
particle creation19,20.

FIG. 3. Space-time diagram of a slow-light catastrophe.
The ﬁgure illustrates the fate of a wave packet ϕ(t, z) that ex-
periences the formation of the horizon Z. Initially, the packet
oscillates with positive frequencies in time t and propagates
from the left to the right in space z. The horizon cannot gen-
erate negative frequencies in the reﬂected light, apart from a
brief burst that we neglect. On the left side of Z we thus re-
gard ϕ(t, z) as analytic18 in t on the lower half of the complex
t plane. Furthermore, ϕ(t, z) is analytic in z on the upper half
plane throughout the history of the wave packet, because the
process (2) conserves analyticity18. Yet ϕ(t, z) is not analytic
in t on the other side of the horizon, as the solution (8) indi-
cates. Here waves with negative frequencies are continuously
peeling away from the horizon, corresponding to a stationary
creation of slow-light quanta.

Similar to a gravitational collapse2, the tuning of the
control ﬁeld towards a parabolic intensity proﬁle triggers
a wave catastrophe. In turn, the slow-light quantum ﬁeld
sets out to deplete the control beam, taking energy from
it, in an attempt to alter the intensity proﬁle that has
caused the catastrophe, yet in vain. The control beam
continuously replenishes the proﬁle, driving a stationary
production of slow-light quantum pairs. The two parti-
cles of each pair are created on opposite sides of the hori-
zon, they depart at a snail’s pace, accelerate gradually
and emerge as detectable photons, similar to the Hawk-
ing radiation3,19 of black holes. In contrast to gravita-
tional holes, one can explore the other side of the horizon
and measure the non-local correlations22 of the photon
pairs. The weight of the negative-frequency component
w∗ in the vacuum modes (8) gives20 the average photon
number per mode,

¯n =

1
(eπµ + e−πµ)

2 .

(9)

Maximally 1/4 photons are created on average, which is
quite substantial, considering the fact that bright sun-
light carries a mere 0.01 photons per mode in the optical
range of the Planck spectrum22. Yet the pair production
occurs in a narrow frequency window above the critical
frequency ω0 + c2/(8a2ω0) which, for realistic experimen-
tal parameters4,6, reduces the total photon ﬂux to a few
millions of particles per second, a respectable rate. One
could perhaps see the radiation with the naked eye. The
characteristic length a of the group-velocity proﬁle (1)
determines the spectral width (9) of the pair production.
The steeper the control-ﬁeld gradient is, the more quanta
are created. Black holes show a similar behavior3. The
smaller the hole is, the larger is the gravity gradient at
the horizon and the stronger is the radiation generated3.
Close to the horizon the susceptibility of slow light
diverges. Yet Nature tends to prevent inﬁnite suscepti-
bilities: Instead of responding inﬁnitely strongly, opti-
cal media become absorptive or non-linear. According
to the physics of EIT illustrated in ﬁgure 2, the optical

ϕ

×

non-linearity of slow light depends on the ratio of the
probe and control intensities Ip and Ic. Equation (6)
2 grows linearly in z, whereas Ic is
shows that Ip ∝ |
|
quadratic in z. Therefore, at a critical distance from the
horizon the EIT medium becomes non-linear. A detailed
three-dimensional calculation, using the parameters of
the experiments4,6, indicates that the non-linearity sets
on before the absorption of the medium becomes impor-
tant, given a suﬃciently steep control-intensity gradient.
The Rabi frequency22 of the control light should grow at
least by 10MHz per distance measured in wave lengths
103λ0.
λ0 = 2π/k0. In this case the scale a is about 5
The quantum radiation of a slow-light catastrophe re-
sembles Hawking radiation but also exhibits some in-
teresting diﬀerences. The emitted spectrum (9) is not
Planckian, whereas a black hole of Schwarzschild radius
rs appears as a black-body radiator with temperature3
¯hc/(4πrs). The diﬀerences between the two spectra can
be traced back to two diﬀerent classes of wave catastro-
phes. In both cases18, waves freeze at an horizon in the
form ζp with an exponent p of iµ + 1/2 for slow-light
media but with an exponent iµ for black holes where
µ = 2πrs ω/c. Note that Unruh’s eﬀect21 of radiation
seen by an accelerated observer is of Hawking-class as
well19 and so are most of the proposed artiﬁcial black
holes15,23−29. Remarkably, Schwinger’s pair production
of charged particles in electrostatic ﬁelds30 is accompa-
nied by a subtle wave catastrophe of exponent19 iµ
1/2
−
and leads to a Boltzmannian spectrum ¯n = exp(
2πµ).
All three catastrophes agree in the limit of large µ but
deviate signiﬁcantly in the regime of maximal particle
production where µ is small. It might be interesting to
ﬁnd out whether Nature oﬀers more than the three quan-
tum catastrophes.

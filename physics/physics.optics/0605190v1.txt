Abstract

The waves propagation in the anisotropic media with single-sheeted hyperboloid dispersion rela-

tion is investigated. It is shown that the single-sheeted hyperboloid dispersion relation is an exact

solution of Maxwell equations. E- (or H-) polarized waves are positively refracted whereas H- (or

E-) polarized waves are negatively refracted at the interface associated with such anisotropic me-

dia. It is found that there dose not exist optical axis in the anisotropic media with single-sheeted

hyperboloid dispersion if the permittivity and permeability tensors are diagonalizable simultane-

ously.

INTRODUCTION

In classic electrodynamics,

it is well known that the electrodynamic properties of

anisotropic materials are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those of isotropic materials. Electro-

magnetic plane waves propagating in a conventional anisotropic crystal exhibit sphere and

ellipsoid wave-vector surfaces [1, 2]. The recent advent of a new class of anisotropic mate-

rial, in which does not necessarily require that all tensor elements of ε and µ have negative

values. The studies of such anisotropic materials have recently received much interest and

attention [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Under such circumstances, the dispersion relations will exhibit

single-sheeted and double-sheeted hyperboloid wave-vector surfaces.

In general, E- and H- polarized waves propagate in diﬀerent directions in anisotropic

media. For propagation in the direction of the optic axes, there is only one value of wave

vector and, consequently, only one phase velocity. There are, however, two independent

directions of polarization [1, 2]. Now a question arises: whether there exist any optical axis

in anisotropic with single-sheeted hyperboloid wave-vector surface.

In the present paper, we present a detailed investigation on the waves propagation charac-

teristics in anisotropic media with single-sheeted hyperboloid dispersion relation. We show

that the single-sheeted hyperboloid dispersion relation is an exact solution of the Maxwell

equations. We ﬁnd that E- (or H-) polarized beam is positively refracted whereas H- (or

E-) polarized beam is negatively refracted at the interface associated with such anisotropic

media. We conclude that there dose not exist optical axis in the anisotropic media with

single-sheeted hyperboloid dispersion if the permittivity and permeability tensors are diag-

onalizable simultaneously.

II. PLANE-WAVE PROPAGATION IN ANISOTROPIC MEDIA

In this section, we will present a brief investigation on the refraction behavior at the inter-

face between isotropic media and quasiisotropic media. To simplify the proceeding analyses,

we assume the permittivity and permeability tensors are diagonalizable simultaneously:

where εi and µi (i = x, y, z) are the permittivity and permeability constants in the principal

coordinate system.

We choose the z axis to be normal to the interface, the x axis in the plane of the ﬁgure,

and the y axis out of the plane of the ﬁgure. We consider the propagation of a planar wave
of frequency ω as E = E0eik·r−iωt and H = H0eik·r−iωt from isotropic media into anisotropic

media. In isotropic media, the accompanying dispersion relation has the familiar form

x + k2

y + k2

z = ǫIµI

ω2
c2 .

Here kx and kz are the x and z components of the propagating wave vector. εI and µi are

the permittivity and permeability constants, respectively. ω is the frequency, and c is the

speed of light in vacuum.

In the anisotropic media, Maxwell’s equations yield a scalar wave equation:

∇ × E = −

D = ε · E,

In the present paper, we focused our interest in the case that both E- and H-polarized waves

exhibit single-sheeted hyperboloid wave-vector surfaces.

III. SINGLE-SHEETED HYPERBOLOID DISPERSION RELATION

First we assume the revolution axes of the two single-sheeted hyperboloid coincide with

z axis as shown in Fig. 1a. The anisotropic parameters should satisfy the conditions:

qy = 0). The incident angle of light is given by

can be written as

where σ = +1 or σ = −1. The choice of the sign ensures that light power propagates away

It should be noted that the actual direction of light is deﬁned by the time-averaged

For the purpose of illustration, the frequency contour will be used to determine the re-

fracted waves as shown in Fig. 3. From the boundary condition qx = kx, we can obtain two

possibilities for the refracted wave vector. Energy conservation requires that the z compo-

nent of poynting vector must propagates away from the interface, for instance, qE
z and qH

z /εx > 0. Then the sign of qE

z can be determined easily. The correspond-

z /µx > 0

and qH

ing Poynting vector should be drawn perpendicularly to the dispersion contour [10]. Thus

we can obtain two possibilities (inward or outward), while only the Poynting vector with

ST z > 0 is causal.

We thus ﬁnd that in such an anisotropic medium E- and H-polarized waves exhibit oppo-

site amphoteric refraction characteristics, such as E- (or H-) polarized waves are positively

refracted whereas H- (or E-) polarized waves are negatively refracted.

(a) and (b) are the corresponding frequency contour shown in Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b. The

circle and single-sheeted hyperbola represent the dispersion relations of the isotropic medium and

the anisotropic medium, respectively. The incident wave vector k is parallel to the Poynting vector

SI in the isotropic medium. Because the anisotropy, ST must lie normal to the frequency contour.

For propagation in the direction of the optic axes, there is only one value of wave vector

and, consequently, only one phase velocity. There are, however, two independent directions

of polarization [1, 2]. We conclude that the media with single-sheeted dispersion relation

can not been regarded as uniaxial. It should be mentioned that the revolution axis can not

be regarded as optical axis, if we think the conventional optical axis is still correct.

We ﬁnd that E- and H-polarized waves have the same wave-vector surface while E- (or

refracted in such anisotropic media. It should be mentioned that E- and H-polarized waves

have the same and exhibit the same propagation properties in quasiisotropic media. We

thus conclude that this kind of media can not be regarded as quasiisotropic.

In this section, we shall explore the interesting conception of plane optical axis. In general,

two single-sheeted hyperboloid intersect in a curve.

The two single-sheeted hyperboloid have the same revolution axis as shown in Fig. 3a. Here

The revolution axes of the two single-sheeted hyperboloid are perpendicular to each other

as shown in Fig. 3b.

Now an interesting question naturally arise: whether E- and H-polarized waves exhibit

the same propagation features in the special plane. In the following analyses, we will explore

this question. We show the refractive geometry in Fig. 4, where a plane electromagnetic

wave is incident from isotropic media into the anisotropic media. If the incident wave vector

incident with diﬀerent azimuth angle ϕ from isotropic media into the anisotropic media.

The incident angle of light is given by

components of the wave vectors must be continuous, i.e. q⊥ = k⊥. Based on the dispersion

relations and the boundary conditions, the refractive angle of wave vector can be obtained.

In addition to the refraction of a wave incident at the interface between the isotropic

media and the anisotropic media, we are also interested in the magnitude of the reﬂection

coeﬃcient, so we must solve the boundary condition at the interface. For E-polarized incident

waves, the ﬁeld is composed of the incident and reﬂected waves, having the form

EI = [− sin ϕex + cos ϕey] exp[i(kxx + kyy + kzz)],

(25)

8

ER = [−REx sin ϕex + REy cos ϕey] exp[i(kxx + kyy − kzz)],

(26)

where REx and REy is the reﬂection coeﬃcient of the x and y components respectively.

Matching the boundary conditions for each k component at z = 0 gives the complex ﬁeld in

the anisotropic media can be written in the form

EE

T = [−TEx sin ϕex + TEy cos ϕey] exp[i(qxx + qyy + qzz)],

(27)

where TEx and TEy are the transmission coeﬃcients of the x and y components respectively.

Based on the boundary conditions yield the equation

1 + REx = TEx,

1 + REy = TEy,

(28)

A second equation can be found when we require continuity of the transverse component

of the magnetic ﬁeld, which we can ﬁnd from the electric ﬁeld by use of the Maxwell curl

equation combined with the general constitutive relation

H = i

µ−1∇ × E,

Equating the x and y components of the magnetic vectors corresponding to the incident,

reﬂected, and transmitted ﬁelds, we have

µykz(1 − REx) = µITExqE

z , µxkz(1 − REy) = µITEyqE

(30)

For E-polarized incident waves, combining Eq. (30) with Eq. (28), one can be obtain the

following expression for the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients for x and y components

For H-polarized waves, the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients can be obtained in similar

After the transmission coeﬃcients are determined, the energy current density S of the

Comparing Eq. (35) with Eq. (36) show that the Poynting vectors of E- and H-polarized

waves do not generally locate in the same plane.

For the purpose of illustration, frequency contour will be used to determine the refracted

waves as shown in Fig. 5. From the boundary condition q⊥ = k⊥, we can obtain two possi-

bilities for the refracted wave vector. Energy conservation requires that the z component of

poynting vector must propagates away from the interface, for instance:

Ex sin2 ϕqE

> 0,

+

Hy cos2 ϕqH

> 0.

Then the signs of qE

z and qH

z can be determined easily. The corresponding Poynting vectors

should be drawn perpendicularly to the dispersion contour. Thus we can obtain two possi-

bilities, while only the Poynting vector with ST z > 0 is causal. Since εx/µx = εy/µy < 0, qE
z
and qH

z always have the opposite sign as can be seen from Eqs. (37) and (38). Therefore E-

and H-polarized waves exhibit diﬀerent values of wave vector.

The anisotropic medium will exhibit diﬀerent dispersion relations with diﬀerent azimuth

angles as shown in Fig 4. When the azimuth angle ϕ is increased to ϕc, the dispersion

equation for both E- and H-polarized waves are the same straights lines as shown in Fig. 4c.

While in the special incident plane, E- and H-polarized waves exhibit diﬀerent refractive

properties. Based on the above analysis, we thus conclude that this kind of media can not

be regard as plane axis.

V. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have investigated the properties of waves propagation in the anisotropic

media with single-sheeted hyperboloid dispersion relation. We are sure that our scheme has

not exhausted the interesting possibilities. We conclude that there dose not exist optical axis

in the anisotropic media with single-sheeted hyperboloid dispersion if the permittivity and

permeability tensors are diagonalizable simultaneously. In particular, the anisotropic media

11

will exhibit some interesting wave-vector surfaces when the permittivity and permeability

tensors are not diagonalizable simultaneously. We expect many potential device applications

can be fabricated based on the special properties of waves propagation discussed above. They

can, for example, be used to construct a very simple and eﬃcient beam splitter.

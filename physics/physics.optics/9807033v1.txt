Numerical simulation of gliding reﬂection
of X-ray beam from rough surface

T.A.Bobrova, L.I.Ognev

Abstract

A new method for investigation of X-ray beam propagation in a rough
narrow dielectrical waveguide is proposed on the basis of the numerical
integration of the quazioptical equation. In calculations a model rough
surface is used with the given distribution of hights of roughness and
given correlation properties of the surface. The method is free from
the limitations such as inﬁniteness of the surface length and plane wave
approximation which are nessesary for application of Andronov- Leon-
tovich method. Our method can be applied to any surface with given
nonhomogeniety and distribution of transitional layer.

In the middle of 1970-s the experiments on chanalization of soft X-
rays [1] and middle range X-rays [2] in glass tubes and also for ﬁltering
of hard part of X-ray radiation in bent tubes bundles [3]. The workabil-
ity of such systems was demonstrated for transport of X-ray radiation.
Later the interest to this manner of X-ray steering was connected with
the suggestion to use the samples of many specially bent tubes for geo-
metrical focusing and concentrating of X-ray beam [4]. The experiments
were performed for transmission of X-ray beam through ”gap-less colli-
mator” - micron gap betwean two tightly pressed together glass plates
[5, 6]. The revival of interest to localizing of X-rays in thin glass capil-
laries of changing diameter in the condition of total external reﬂection
at grazing incidence on smooth surface was connected with the attempts
of microfocusing in a narrowing tube [7] (till 7µm) or in a narrowing
polycapillary system [8], consisting of a great number of melted-in to-
gether thin glass tubes forming one hexahedral block. The problems of
the structure of the focus of such system deals with the work [9].

The channalisation of X-ray radiation in hollow glass tubes is pos-
sible due to the eﬀect of total external reﬂection [10]. The dielectric
permeability of substance for electro-magnetic radiation with the energy
higher than binding energy of electrons in atoms can be approximately
written with the use of plasma frequency ωp [4]

ǫ(ω) = 1

(ωp/ω)2.

−
Because in X-ray energy range ǫ(ω) < 1 and optical density of glass
is smaller than the vacuum (or air) optical density the eﬀect of total
external reﬂection takes place when the rays come from outside and for
this reason is called total external reﬂection (TER).

When X-ray radiation comes on suﬃciently smooth surface in the
conditions of TER the radiation penetrates only at small depth of the
order of 60 ˚A, that maintains the eﬀective reﬂection and channalisation
of radiation in hollow glass tubes.

Besides of the absorption the eﬀectiveness of reﬂection depends strongly

on the scattering of radiation on roughness of the surface. The most of
the results on the inﬂuence of roughness on the reﬂection of X-ray ra-
diation from surfaces were obtained in the approximation of Andronov
and Leontovich [11]. The revue of the results can be found in [12]. The
approximation is based on the suggestion that the initial wave coming on
the surface is a plane wave and the scattered wave can be found for small
perturbations of the boundary between two media. That is why the in-
vestigation of scattreing of wave coming on absorbing surface at small

1

angles is interesting because in this case the Andronov and Leontovich
approximation apparentely can not be applied any longer.

coordinates x, y and longitudinal coordinate z [13]. The evolution along
the direction z is much slower than along transversal coordinates. Thus

2 The method of simulation of rough sur-

face.

Under the total external reﬂection at grazing incidence of X-ray beam
the most important is scattering within the plane of incidence because
the scattering withing the plane of the interface is small [12]. First of
all it is due to the fact that the wavelength of the radiation is much
smaller than the characteristic scale of inhomogeneities. That is why
for simulation of scattering of X-rays at TER conditions it is enough to
account for only scattering in the plane of incidence within 2-dimensional
model. In this case the value δǫ in the right side of equation (3) becomes
the function of coordinates z and x :

0,

where the function ξ(z) is the hight of the rough surface proﬁle and can
be regarded as a random value (see Fig.1()).

3 Numerical results and discussions.

The numerical method for solving of the equation (1) was used earlier for
study of motion of channeled electrons in single crystals [15] and reﬂec-
tion of positrons from slanting cut single crystals [16]. The method im-
plies step by step calculation of the amplitude of the X-ray wave A(x, z)
along the surface of reﬂection starting from its initial value at z=0.

For simulation of a rough surface the code was constructed calculat-
ing random sequence of numbers ξ(n) in accordence with representation
(5). With the given correlation function by relationship (4) the ampli-
tudes Ek of spectral components were determined. For simulation of
random phase αk random numbers generators were used. Fragments
of random surface ξ(n) is presented on on Fig. 1(a). With account of
several realisation of numerical process with diﬀerent number of points
correletion functions were calculated again along with propability den-
sity distribution. On Fig. 1(b) the comparison of given correlation
function (curve 1) and correlation functions calculated with realisation
of n=1000 points (curve 2) and n=10 000 points (curve 3 that nearly
coinsides with 1). It is obvious that with the increase of n correlation
function of the process ξ(n) approaches the given function. It was also
shown that the distribution of the propability density for random pro-
cess ξ(n) approaches Gaussian distribution when the number of points
in the realisation increases (Fig.1(c)).

4

So we can aﬃrm that the created code simulates random surface with
the given statistical characteristics and Gaussian propability density dis-
tribution.

·

The calculations were made for the radiation with the energy 10 keV
and for interaction with rough glass surface. The width of the correlation
function was chosen 5µm. The angle of total external reﬂection is ϕc =
3

10−3rad.
When the angle of incidence of X-ray wave is not zero the surface can
be regarded as inﬁnite and incident wave as a plane wave. On Fig. 2 the
distribution of the intensity of the radiation along the coordinate x (the
axis x is perpendicular to the surface) for reﬂection from smooth surface
for the angle of incidence ϕ = 10−3rad. The range 0 < x < 2100˚A
corresponds to the substance layer. The oscillations of the intensity
are caused by the interference of incident and mirror reﬂected waves.
At some distance from the surface that is deﬁned by numerical scheme
parameters the amplitude was smoothly truncated that is dependent on
the use of the Furier transformation on the x coordinate for solving the
equation (3) (see Fig.2).

With the increasing of roughness amplitude the angular spectrum of
the reﬂected beam the mirror reﬂected beam decreases and at the same
time numerous random maxima arise so that clear interference diﬀrac-
tion picture disappears near the surface. Simple estimate for roughness
tolerance of total external reﬂection observation was given in [17]

where λ0 is the radiation wavelength. As a clear illustration of inverse
dependence of tolerable roughness amplitude on the incidence angle can
be used angular spectra of reﬂection shown on Fig. 3. The spectra were

roughness amplitude is used). In the ﬁrst case the inﬂuence of roughness
on the spectrum is small but in the last case the mirror reﬂected peak
can not be observed in practice.

The calculations of the distribution of the intensity of radiation near
the smooth reﬂecting surface can show the depth of penetration of X-
rays into the surface under the conditions of TER as a function of the
incidence angle and for ϕ = 10−3rad. it is 60˚A, for ϕ = 10−4rad. - 10 ˚A.
For reﬂection from rough surfaces the depth of penetration (counted
from the mean value of the roughness) is approximately equal to the
mean squared amplitude of roughness.

With the created complex of codes calculations were performed for
transmission of X-ray radiation in a 2-dimentional rough capillary for
zero and near to zero entrance angles. Transversal dimensions of cap-
2µm, that caused diﬀractional spreading of the
illaries were chosen 1
10−4rad. The length was chosen as
plane wave to the values 0.5
1

2cm.
On Fig.4 the dependence of integral intensity (over the transversal
dimension of the capillary) on the distance from the entrance to the
capillary. The angle of incidence ϕ0 = 0, the width of the capillary
is 2µm, the roughness is 1200˚A. Abrupt falling of the intensity of the
radiation in the input of the capillary is connected with the absorption
of the radiation coming on glass butt-ends and transmitting within the
substance. This part of the radiation can be regarded as fully absorped
1000µm from the input of the capillary. The analysis
at the distance z
of the distribution of losses along the capillary length for z
1000µm
reveals its considerable dependence on the distance from the capillary
input. The deeper radiation penetrates the capillary the smaller loss
normalized to the length unit is that is apparently related to consequent
decay of modes the most strongly penetrating into the substance.

≥

≤

The losses of radiation in the capillary are the greater the the greater
capillary wall roughness is and the bigger the angle of incidence of the
wave into the capillary is. The partial dependence of losses of the radia-
tion (size for zero incidence angle and angle value 10−4 rad is shown on
Fig.5. The losses were calculated on the range 0.25cm
1cm from
the capillary input. It is worth noting that losses are not zero even for
the capillary with smooth walls.

≤

≤

z

The dependence of losses of radiation in capillaries of various widths
with wall roughness 800˚A and 400˚A and also without roughness for zero
incidence angle are shown on Fig.6. The increase of losses when the width
of the capillary ∆x is decreased can be accounted for by the broadening
of the plane wave incident on the input of the capillary ∆ϕ=λ0/∆x.

On Fig.7 radiation angular spectra are shown for capillaries with
the length 1 cm of various widths with smooth and rough walls. The
calculations were made for zero incidence angle. The decrease of the
square under the spectral peak along with the increase of roughness can
be accounted for by higher absorption of the radiation but the shape
and the width of the spectral peak practically does not depend on the
roughness size.

4 Conclusion.

So the created code can simulate interaction of X-rays with rough surface
(including zero gliding angle) without supposition of inﬁnite plane wave
but with direct account of given surface relief. That is the advantage
of the approach over analytical methods (incliding Andronov-Leontovich
approimation). In comparison with numerical methods using geometrical
optics the proposed method takes into account the wave nature of the
radiation (diﬀraction).

The obtained results enable also to give new interpretation of the
experiments with ”gapless collimator” published in 1981-1984 [5, 6]. Ac-
coding to the data of angular distanse between interference peaks in
transmitted beam with account of diﬀraction the gap width is 10µm but
not 1µm as it follows from [6] without account for diﬀraction. In this
case diﬀerent number of transversal modes is excited depending on the
tilt angle of input beam. On the other hand if in glass plates unpolished
transversal band is left the independence of output beam on the input
beam tilt can be explained due to strong absorption of higher transversal
modes along with retaining of lowest symmetric mode (see Fig.7).

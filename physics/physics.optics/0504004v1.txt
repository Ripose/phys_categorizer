We determine the range of thicknesses and refractive indices for which omnidirectional reﬂection
from quasiperiodic multilayers occurs. By resorting to the notion of area under the transmittance
curve, we assess in a systematic way the performance of the diﬀerent quasiperiodic Fibonacci mul-
tilayers.

INTRODUCTION

Photonic crystals are periodically structured dielec-
tric media possessing photonic band gaps: ranges of fre-
quency in which strong reﬂection occurs for all angles
of incidence and all polarizations. They then behave as
omnidirectional reﬂectors, free of dissipative losses. Since
the initial predictions of Yablonovitch [1] and John [2],
photonic crystals have been attracting a lot of atten-
tion and a wide variety of applications have been sug-
gested [3].

In the one-dimensional case, a photonic crystal is noth-
ing more than a periodic dielectric structure. Bragg mir-
rors consisting of alternating low- and high-index layers
constitute, perhaps, the archetypical example [4]. In par-
ticular, quarter-wave stacks (at normal incidence) are the
most thoroughly studied in connection with omnidirec-
tional reﬂection (ODR) [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

The introduction of Fibonacci multilayers by Kohmoto
and coworkers [11] spurred the interest for both possible
optical applications [12] and theoretical aspects of light
transmission in aperiodic media [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. In
fact, the possibility of obtaining ODR in quasiperiodic
Fibonacci multilayers has been put forward recently [18,
19, 20, 21, 22].

Underlying all these eﬀorts a crucial question remains
concerning whether quasiperiodic Fibonacci multilayers
would achieve better performance than usual periodic
ones. To answer such a fundamental question one ﬁrst
needs to quantify the idea of ODR performance in a
unique manner that permits unambiguous comparison
between diﬀerent structures. Only quite recently a suit-
able ﬁgure of merit has been introduced: the area under
the transmittance curve as a function of the incidence
angle [23].
In this paper, we resort to this concept of
area to rank in a consistent way the ODR characteristics
of these quasiperiodic systems.

II. QUASIPERIODIC FIBONACCI
MULTILAYERS

A Fibonacci system is based on the recursive relation
S0 = {H}, S1 = {L} and Sj = Sj−1Sj−2 for j ≥ 2.
Here H and L are deﬁned as being two dielectric layers
with refractive indices (nH , nL) and thicknesses (dH , dL),
respectively. The material H has a high refractive index
while L is of low refractive index. The number of layers
is given by Fj , where Fj is a Fibonacci number obtained
from the recursive law Fj = Fj−1 +Fj−2, with F0 = F1 =
1.

In order to properly compare the optical response of
these systems we will rely on the transfer-matrix tech-
nique. The transfer matrix Mj for the Fibonacci system
Sj can be computed as [11]

M0 = MH ,

M1 = ML,

Mj = Mj−1Mj−2,

j ≥ 2.

(2.1)

(2.2)

The transfer matrix for the single layer H is

MH = 



cos βH
1
qH

sin βH

qH sin βH

cos βH



,



and a analogous expression for L.
Here βH =
(2π/λ)nH dH cos θH is the layer phase thickness, θH be-
ing the angle of refraction, which is determined by Snell
law. The wavelength in vacuum of the incident radiation
is λ. The parameter qH can be written for each basic
polarization (p or s) as

qH (p) =

nH cos θ
n cos θH

,

qH (s) =

n cos θ
nH cos θH

,

(2.3)

where we have assumed that the layer is imbedded in a
medium of refractive index n. Henceforth θ will denote
the angle of incidence and, for simplicity, the surrounding
medium we will supposed to be air (n = 1).

Let us consider a N -period ﬁnite structure whose basic
cell is precisely the Fibonacci multilayer Sj. We denote
this system as [Sj]N and its overall transfer matrix is

III. ASSESSING ODR FROM QUASIPERIODIC
MULTILAYERS

2

We ﬁrst investigate the range of layer thicknesses for
which ODR exists; that is, when condition (2.6) holds
true for all the incidence angles. Although for the simple
periodic system S2 analytic approximations are at hand,
the general problem seems to be very involved and we
content ourselves with a numerical exploration.

For deﬁniteness, we ﬁx the refractive indices to the val-
ues nL = 1.75 and nH = 3.35 at λ = 10 µm. In Fig. 1 we
have plotted the zones of ODR for the basic periods Sj
(with j = 2, 3, 4, 5) in terms of the adimensional thick-
nesses nLdL/λ and nH dH /λ. Note that the use of these
adimensional variables not only simpliﬁes the presenta-
tion of the results, but, as dispersion can be neglected,
the results apply to more general situations.

j = (Mj)N .

(2.4)

When the unit cell is S2, the resulting multilayer [S2]N
is periodic. For j > 2, [Sj]N are quasiperiodic.

The transmittance T (N )

is given in terms of the matrix

In the theory of periodic systems it is well established
that band gaps appear whenever the trace of the basic
period satisﬁes [4]

| Tr(Mj)| ≥ 2.

(2.6)

This should be worked out for both basic polarizations.
The trace map is a powerful tool to investigate this con-
dition, especially when the index j is high [24]. In our
context, it reads as

Tr(Mj+1) = Tr(Mj) Tr(Mj−1) − Tr(Mj−2).

(2.7)

This simple recurrence relation allows us to compute eas-
ily the band gaps. We quote here the ﬁrst nontrivial
cases, namely, the pure periodic system S2 = {LH} and
the ﬁrst quasiperiodic one S3 = {LHL}, respectively:

| cos βL cos βH − ΛLH sin βL sin βH | ≥ 1,

| cos(2βL) cos βH − ΛLH sin(2βL) sin βH| ≥ 1.

The function ΛLH is

,

which is frequency independent but takes diﬀerent val-
ues for p and s polarizations. However, one can check
that, irrespective of the angle of incidence, the following
relation for both basic polarizations holds:

Due to the restriction (2.10), whenever Eqs. (2.8) are
fulﬁlled for p polarization, they are always true also for
s polarization. In consequence, the p-polarization bands
are more stringent than the corresponding s-polarization
ones [22].

FIG. 1: Regions where ODR (for p polarization) occurs for
the Fibonacci systems S2 = {LH}, S3 = {LHL}, S4 =
{LHLLH}, and S5 = {LHLLHLHL}. We have taken
nL = 1.75 and nH = 3.35 at λ = 10 µm. The inset iden-
tiﬁes the ﬁlled ellipses. The marked points correspond to the
minimum area for each one of the systems.

The contours of all these regions are approximately el-
liptical. For every allowed value of nLdL/λ there are two
values of nH dH /λ. This can be traced back to the explicit
form of Eqs. (2.8) for the band gaps. The ellipses for S2
are the biggest, which conﬁrms that this simple system
has the best range of ODR in terms of nd/λ variables.
Note also that the usual Bragg solution with layers of a
quarter-wavelength thick at normal incidence, namely

nLdL/λ = nH dH /λ = 1/4,

(3.1)

It is worth stressing the fact that the regions of ODR
for S2 and S3 are disjoint. This increases the diﬃculty
of comparison between these systems. On the contrary,
all the quasiperiodic multilayers have a signiﬁcant region
of common parameters. In fact, from the system S6 on-
wards, all the elliptic contours are essentially the same
as for the S5.

Eq. (3.2), as a function of nLdL/λ and nH dH/λ for the system

FIG. 3: Regions of ODR for the same Fibonacci multilayers
as in Fig. 1 in the plane (nL, nH ) of refractive indices. The
curves show the limit of ODR for each stack with the optimum
thicknesses marked in Fig. 1.

These regions of ODR are not enough to fully quantify
the performance of the multilayer. In Ref. [23] we have
proposed that, once the materials and the wavelength are
ﬁxed, the area under the transmittance as a function of
the angle of incidence θ

is an appropriate ﬁgure of merit for the structure: the
smaller this area, the better the performance as ODR. In
Fig. 2 we have plotted this area as a function of nLdL/λ
and nH dH /λ for S2. The area has been computed solely
for the points fulﬁlling the ODR condition, so the abrupt
steps give the boundaries of ODR plotted in Fig. 1. How-
ever, this function varies signiﬁcantly in the ODR region.
In fact, for the present case the minimum of this area

is reached at the point

nLdL/λ = 0.34305,

nHdH /λ = 0.25416.

(3.3)

While the value of nH dH /λ essentially coincide with the
quarter wavelength solution (3.1), nLdL/λ diﬀers more
than 30 % of that solution.

In Fig. 1 we have marked the points of minimum area
for each one of the Fibonacci systems Sj. We see the
strong diﬀerence for the periodic and the quasiperiodic
systems. In fact, for the latter (Sj with j ≥ 3) we can
summarize the results saying that the optimum area is
reached approximately at the values of the parameters

nLdL/λ = 1/8,

nH dH /λ = 1/4.

(3.4)

In our view, this is a remarkable result: from the principle
of minimum area, we have consistently derived optimum
parameters for ODR, which diﬀer a lot from the usual
solutions found in the literature.

For the thicknesses giving minimum area, we have cal-
culated the region in the (nL, nH ) plane for which ODR

occurs. In Fig. 3 we have plotted the boundary of such
a region for the same Fibonacci multilayers as before:
above such curves we have the ODR region. It is again
the periodic system the ﬁrst in fulﬁlling ODR: the on-
set of the ODR curve is at nH ≃ 2.5, in agreement with
previous estimations [10].

Of course, the optimum parameters for the system Sj
do not need to be optimum for [Sj]N . To elucidate this
question, we have computed numerically the values of
nLdL/λ and nH dH /λ for diﬀerent systems containing up
to 42 layers and for the same indices as before. In Table 1
we have summarized the corresponding data. We have in-
cluded only results for the ﬁve ﬁrst periods N = 1, . . . , 5,
since from [Sj]5 onwards, all the thicknesses are fairly
stable, while the area tends rapidly to 0, as one would
expect from a band gap. We can conclude that the opti-
mum parameters do not depend strongly on the number
of layers.

systems ﬁt into a straight line. On the other hand, the
periodic system S2 lies on another straight line, but with
a better slope. That is, for a given number of layers of
the system (and under the hypothesis of optimum thick-
nesses), the system [LH]N oﬀers better performance than
any other.

Of course, one may think that the bandwidth of these
systems is diﬀerent. Sometimes the bandwidth is deﬁned
at normal incidence, and then it has been argued that
quasiperiodic systems oﬀer fundamental advantages [20].
If we denote by λshort and λlong the longer- and shorter-
wavelength edges for given ODR bands (of the basic pe-
riod), it seems more appropriate to deﬁne the ODR band-
width as [9]

B =

λlong − λshort
1
2 (λlong + λshort)

.

(3.5)

Note that this is the appropriate deﬁnition in our case.
Obviously, the parameters chosen for the purpose of com-
parison must be the ones giving minimum area; i. e.,
optimum ODR behavior.
In fact, we have numerically
checked that the parameters giving optimum area oﬀer
also a good bandwidth.
In Table 1 we have indicated
this parameter, conﬁrming again that with the proper
deﬁnition the periodic system is the best.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

From previous results for the case of Bragg mirrors, it
is reasonable to assume that the transmittance of [Sj]N
tends to zero exponentially with the number of layers.
To test such an ansatz, we have plotted the area (in a
logarithmic scale) for all these systems. The results are
presented in Fig. 4. We think that a simple glance at
this ﬁgure is enough to decide on the performance of the
quasiperiodic systems as omnidirectional reﬂectors.

It is quite clear that all the quasiperiodic systems, ir-
respective of the index j, behave essentially in the same
way as far as ODR is concerned. All the points for these

In summary, we have exploited the idea of minimum
area to fully assess in a systematic way the performance
of omnidirectional reﬂectors. Although quasiperiodic
systems has attracted a lot of interest due to their un-
usual physical properties, Bragg reﬂectors oﬀer the best
performance, although not at a quarter-wavelength thick
at normal incidence. We believe that the best feature of
our approach is that it provides a very clear thread to
deal with omnidirectional reﬂection properties in a sys-
tematic way. Our method is general and can be applied
to any spectral region.

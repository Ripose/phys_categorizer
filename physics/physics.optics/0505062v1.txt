Bistability induced by nonlinear Kerr eﬀect in arrays of coupled waveguides is studied and shown
to be a means to conceive light detectors that switch under excitation by a weak signal. The detector
is obtained by coupling two single 1D waveguide to an array of coupled waveguides with adjusted
indices and coupling. The process is understood by analytical description in the conservative and
continuous case and illustrated by numerical simulations of the model with attenuation.

Introduction. Arrays of adjacent optical dielectric
waveguides coupled by power exchange between guided
modes [1] [2], have allowed to conceive devices possessing
extremely rich optical properties, already at the linear
level, such as anomalous refraction and diﬀraction [3].

At nonlinear level, for intensity-dependent refractive
index (optical Kerr eﬀect), these waveguide arrays be-
come soliton generators [4], as experimentally demon-
strated in [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. The model is a discrete nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equation (NLS) and nonlinearity then mani-
fests by self-modulation of an input signal (injected radi-
ation) that propagates as a NLS discrete soliton [9, 10].
These systems possess also intrinsically discrete proper-
ties [11] and the geometry can be varied to manage dis-
persion [12].

A fundamental property of nonlinear systems that has
not been considered in waveguides arrays is the bista-
bility induced by nonlinearity. It is the purpose of this
work to propose and study a device where bistability, and
consequent switching properties, could be observed and
used to conceive for instance a detector of light sensitive
to extremely weak signal.

We shall make use of the possibility to drive a waveg-
uide array, in the forbidden band gap, through directional
coupling by boundary waveguides, which results in the
generation of (discrete) gap solitons [14], produced by
nonlinear supratransmission [15], and used to conceive
resonators with nonlinear eigenstates [16].

is operated in such a way that the guided modes in the
two lateral waveguides would not linearly propagate in the
array due to index diﬀerence. Nonlinear induced bista-
bility allows then to adjust the input radiation such as
to work at the bifurcation point and switch from a state
of vanishing intensity output (from the central waveg-
uides) to a state of strong intensity output, as displayed
on ﬁg.2 that represents the intensity of the ﬂux in the ar-
ray when operated close to the bifurcation point. As the
switch can be operated by a very weak signal (0.03% of
the input amplitude for ﬁg.2), the device is a candidate
for an ultrasensitive bistable detector.

numerical simulations of the model (6) with N = 4, Q =

b = 3.0946 (large arrows). In the lower plot the small arrow
represents a signal of amplitude 0.001 enough to trigger the
switch.

After having brieﬂy recalled the derivation of the dis-
crete NLS model for the envelope of the guided modes
and the proper boundary conditions that results from the
physical context of ﬁg.1, we describe theoretically and
numerically the bistability process. The theory calls to
the continuous limit which gives an accurate description
of the discrete case with enough waveguides and strong
coupling.

where the linear index n = n(~r) may vary in space. Inter-
ested in the stationary regime, the fast oscillating nonlin-
ear term has been discarded (assuming no phase match-
ing between third harmonics).

We consider the index proﬁle of ﬁg.1 and assume a ﬁeld

component E(y, z) in the form

ψj(0) for the rest of the array. The initial condition is
thus

which complete equations (6). The point is that non-
linearity causes the existence of a threshold bs allowing
to take advantage of bistabilility of stationary states, as
described now analytically and numerically.

Then, following [17], we insert (2) in (1), integrate over y

uides together (C1), and that result from the overlap-

This deﬁnes the small parameter ǫ used in expansion (2),

where j runs from j = 1 to j = N
1. Attenuation has
been included (imaginary parts γ and γ0 of the dielectric
constants) to account for a realistic physical situation,
and the actual amplitudes in the lateral driving waveg-
uide have been rescaled by replacing C0ψ0,N by C1ψ0,N .
Prescription of the injected energy ﬂux in the lateral
waveguides results in deﬁning the amplitudes ψ0 and ψN
in z = 0 (say b), which are associated to a set of vanishing

(10)

As far as the light tunnels from the driving waveguides
to the array, the amplitude of light in the driving waveg-
uides decays along z. However, if the coupling Q0 and
the attenuation γ0 are small enough, the intensities in the
driving waveguides decay slowly along z and the above
boundary-value problem quite correctly matches numer-
ical simulation of the discrete model (6).

The stationary solutions of the above problem are ob-
tained by assuming a real valued solution depending on
y only, namely ψ(y, z) = ψ(y) solution of

ψyy + ψ3 = V ψ, ψ(0) = ψ(L) = b.

(11)

From the symmetry of the above bounds, a uniformly
bounded function requires that there exists y0 such that

ψy(y0) = 0, ψ(y0) = B.

(12)

The values b and B are referred respectively to as input
and output amplitudes of the ﬁeld. By integrating (11)
with (12), one gets

This equation has solutions of diﬀerent types [18] de-
pending on the relative values of B and V . In particu-
lar, an input value b of the boundary driving can pro-
duce diﬀerent output amplitudes B. This property holds
when the input amplitude b is less than a value bs, called
the supratransmission threshold, above which the bound-
ary driving induces an instability which generates soliton
emission in the array [19].

This last solution has a threshold amplitude b = bs
reached when the function b(B) in (20) has a vanishing
derivative. The related expression of bs is not explicit al-
though easily evaluated numerically. Note that in general
one has a ﬁnite set of thresholds (their number depend
on the lenght L) but only the ﬁrst one is of interest for
our purpose. Note also that the above three solutions
reach their maximum amplitude B in the array center

The regimes of stationary solutions are reached by nu-
merical simulations of (6) as follows. First we inject into
the driving waveguides the beams with the initial ampli-
tude (7) for b < bs. This produces the type III solution,
a nonlinear analogue to the evanescent wave proﬁle. As

that only the solutions of type I and III can be reached
by numerical simulations, while the type II is unstable
and eventually decays to the stable solution III. Note
also that longer lengths would allow for multiple output
amplitudes, which we do not consider here.)

The same procedure is used when injecting the beams
with b > bs. After a regime of gap solitons emission, the
amplitudes along the lateral waveguides decrease below
the threshold bs, allowing the system to lock to the solu-
tion of type I. The obtained numerical values are plotted
(crosses) along the upper branch (I) of the hysteresis loop

simulations. Another consequence of the attenuation
is the existence of a second (nonzero) threshold input
amplitude where the solution bifurcates back from the
regime I to the regime III. For a vanishing attenuation,
this second threshold would be exactly zero according to
the analytical solution (16). The existence of this lower
end threshold is clearly of importance in view of experi-
mental realization but, as being directly related to atten-
uation, it depends on the precise physical context. Let us
also remark that the output amplitude is sensitive to the
input amplitude values (in both regimes). In particular
the curves (and dots) of ﬁg.3 show that this dependence
is roughly linear as the slopes of the functions B(b) in

regimes I and III have approximately the same slopes.

As a matter of fact we display on the ﬁg.5 the evolution

diﬀerence between the two output signals at y = L/2 in
these two regimes diﬀers substantially (approximately by
two orders of magnitude).

The existence of bistable regimes that switch from a
low to a high output is a candidate for an ultra sensi-
tive bistable light detector. Moreover such a property
holds also in the fully discrete case as displayed in ﬁg.2
(though we do not have in that case an analytical descrip-
tion). Particularly, if one injects in the lateral waveguides
beams of amplitude slightly below the supratransmission
threshold bs, a regime of type III establishes (with small
output amplitude). Then any perturbation of the array
by means of a weak input signal destabilizes the system
which, after transient emission of gap solitons, reaches a
type I regime with large output amplitude. This is pre-
cisely the process described in the intensity plot of ﬁg.2
where the signal producing the switch carries 0.03% of
the driving amplitude.

Note that in such a fully discrete case, the device works
as a digital detector, triggered by any signal received by
the central waveguides. However in the continuous case,
the output signal amplitude can be (approximately) lin-
early related to the input amplitude and, if the variable
parameter is the input amplitudes in the lateral waveg-
uides, then the device can be operated as an ampliﬁcator.

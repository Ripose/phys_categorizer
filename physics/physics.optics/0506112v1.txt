Abstract. We reconsider the basic properties of ray-transfer matrices for ﬁrst-
order optical systems from a geometrical viewpoint.
In the paraxial regime of
scalar wave optics, there is a wide family of beams for which the action of a ray-
transfer matrix can be fully represented as a bilinear transformation on the upper
complex half-plane, which is the hyperbolic plane. Alternatively, this action can
be also viewed in the unit disc. In both cases, we use a simple trace criterion that
arranges all ﬁrst-order systems in three classes with a clear geometrical meaning:
they represent rotations, translations, or parallel displacements. We analyze in
detail the relevant example of an optical resonator.

Keywords: Geometrical methods, matrix methods, paraxial optical systems,

optical resonators.

1. Introduction

Matrix methods [1,2] oﬀer the great advantage of simplifying the presentation of linear
models and clarifying the common features and interconnections of distinct branches
of physics [3]. Modern optics is not an exception and a wealth of input-output relations
can be compactly expressed by a single matrix [4]. For example, the well-known 2
2
ray-transfer matrix, which belongs to the realm of paraxial ray optics, predicts with
almost perfect accuracy the behavior of a Gaussian beam.

×

In this respect, we note that there is a wide family of beams (including Gaussian
Schell-model ﬁelds, which have received particular attention [5–15]) for which a
complex parameter can be deﬁned such that, under the action of ﬁrst-order systems,
it is transformed according to the famous Kogelnik ABCD law [16–20]. This is the
reason why they are so easy to handle. This simplicity, together with the practical
importance that these beams have for laser systems, explain the abundant literature
on this topic [21, 22].

The algebraic basis for understanding the transformation properties of such beams
is twofold: the ray-transfer matrix of any ﬁrst-order system is an element of the group
SL(2, R) [23] and the complex beam parameter changes according to a bilinear (or
M¨obius) transformation [24].

The nature of these results seems to call for a geometrical interpretation. The
interaction between physics and geometry has a long and fruitful story, a unique
example is Einstein theory of relativity. The goal of this paper is precisely to provide
such a geometrical basis, which should be relevant to properly approach this subject.

Geometrical aspects of ﬁrst-order optical systems

The material of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we include a brief
review of the transformation properties of Gaussian beams by ﬁrst-order systems,
introducing a complex parameter Q to describe the diﬀerent states as points of
the hyperbolic plane. The action of the system in terms of Q is then given by
a bilinear transformation, which is characterized through the points that it leaves
invariant. From this viewpoint the three basic isometries of this hyperbolic plane
(i.e., transformations that preserve the distance), namely, rotations, translations, and
parallel displacements, appear linked to the fact that the trace of the ray-transfer
matrix has a magnitude lesser than, greater than, or equal to 2, respectively.

In section 3 we present a mapping that transforms the hyperbolic plane into the
unit disc (which is the Poincar´e model of the hyperbolic geometry) and we proceed
to study the corresponding motions in this disc. Finally, as a direct application,
in section 4 we treat the case of periodic systems, which are the basis for optical
resonators, providing an alternative explanation of the standard stability condition.

We emphasize that this geometrical scenario does not oﬀer any advantage in
terms of computational eﬃciency. Apart from its undeniable beauty, its beneﬁt lies
in gaining insights into the qualitative behaviour of the beam evolution.

2. First-order systems as transformations in the hyperbolic plane H

We consider the paraxial propagation of light through axially symmetric systems,
containing no tilted or misaligned elements. The reader interested in further details
should consult the extensive work of Simon and Mukunda [25–29]. We take a Cartesian
coordinate system whose Z axis is along the axis of the optical system and represent
a ray at a plane z by the transverse position vector x(z) (which can be chosen in the
meridional plane) and by the momentum p(z) = n(z)dx/dz [30]. Here n(z) is the
refractive index and dx/dz is the direction of the ray through z.

At the level of ray optics, a ﬁrst-order system changes the ray parameters by the

simple transformation [31]

which means that M is an element of the group SL(2, R) of real unimodular 2
matrices.

When one goes to paraxial-wave optics, the beams are described in the Hilbert
space L2 of complex-valued square-integrable wave-amplitude functions ψ(x). The
classical phase-space variables x and p are now promoted to self-adjoint operators by
the procedure of wavization [33], which is quite similar to the quantization of position
and momentum in quantum mechanics.

We are interested in the action of a ray-transfer matrix on time-stationary ﬁelds.
We can then focus the analysis on a ﬁxed frequency ω, which we shall omit henceforth.
Moreover, to deal with partially coherent beams we specify the ﬁeld not by its
amplitude, but by its cross-spectral density. The latter is deﬁned in terms of the
former as

Γ(x1, x2) =

ψ∗(x1)ψ(x2)

where the angular brackets denote ensemble averages.

There is a wide family of beams, known as Schell-model ﬁelds, for which the

cross-spectral density (2.3) factors in the form

independent of x that can be identiﬁed with the total irradiance. Clearly, σI and σµ
are, respectively, the eﬀective beam width and the transverse coherence length. Other
well-known families of Gaussian ﬁelds are special cases of these GSM ﬁelds. When

and R is the wave front curvature radius. This parameter fully characterizes the beam
and satisﬁes the Kogelnik ABCD law; namely, after propagation through a ﬁrst-order
system, the parameter Q changes to Q′ via

Q′ = Ψ[M, Q] =

.

Since Im Q > 0 by the deﬁnition (2.6), one immediately checks that Im Q′ > 0 and we
can thus view the action of the ﬁrst-order system as a bilinear transformation Ψ on
the upper complex half-plane. When we use the metric ds =
/ Im Q to measure
|
distances, what we get is the standard model of the hyperbolic plane H [35]. This
plane H is invariant under bilinear transformations.

dQ
|

We note that the whole real axis, which is the boundary of H, is also invariant
under (2.8) and represents wave ﬁelds with unlimited transverse irradiance (contrary
to the notion of a beam). On the other hand, for the points in the imaginary axis we
have an inﬁnite wave front radius, which deﬁnes the corresponding beam waists. The
origin represents a plane wave.

Bilinear transformations constitute an important tool

in many branches of
physics. For example, in polarization optics they have been employed for a simple
classiﬁcation of polarizing devices by means of the concept of eigenpolarizations of the
transfer function [36, 37].

In our context, the equivalent concept can be stated as the beam conﬁgurations

such that Q = Q′ in equation (2.8), whose solutions are

These values of Q are known as the ﬁxed points of the transformation.

The trace of M, Tr(M) = A + D, provides a suitable tool for the classiﬁcation
of optical systems [38]. It has also played an important role in studying propagation
in periodic media [39]. When [Tr(M)]2 < 4 the action is said elliptic and there are
no real roots: they are complex conjugates and only one of them lies in H, while the
other lies outside. When [Tr(M)]2 > 4 there are two real roots (i.e., in the boundary
of H) and the action is hyperbolic. Finally, when [Tr(M)]2 = 4 there is one (double)
real solution and the system action is called parabolic.

To proceed further let us note that by taking the conjugate of M with any matrix
SL(2, R)

C

∈

MC = C M C−1,

(2.10)

we obtain another matrix of the same type, since Tr(M) = Tr(MC). Conversely, if two
systems have the same trace, one can always ﬁnd a matrix C satisfying equation (2.10).
Note that Q is a ﬁxed point of M if and only if the image of Q by C (i.e.,
Ψ[C, Q]) is a ﬁxed point of MC. In consequence, given any ray-transfer matrix M one
can always ﬁnd a C such that MC takes one of the following canonical forms [40, 41]:

The ﬁrst is a rotation, in agreement with Euclidean geometry, since a rotation has

Q′ describe a curve called the orbit of Q under the action of the corresponding one-

(2.11). For matrices KC(ϑ) the orbits are circumferences centered at the invariant
1/Q. For AC(ξ), they are lines going from 0

the orbits are lines parallel to the real axis passing through Q and they are known as
horocycles [42].

For a general matrix M the corresponding orbits can be obtained by transforming
with the appropriate matrix C the orbits described before. The explicit construction
of the family of matrices C is not diﬃcult:
it suﬃces to impose that C transforms
the ﬁxed points of M into the ones of KC(ϑ), AC(ξ), or NC(ν), respectively. Just to
work out an example that will play a relevant role in the forthcoming, we consider a
matrix M representing an elliptic action with one ﬁxed point denoted by Qf . Since
the ﬁxed point for the corresponding canonical matrix KC(ϑ) is +i, the matrix C we
are looking for is determined by

Ψ[C, Qf ] = i.

In ﬁgure 1.b we have plotted typical examples of such orbits for elliptic,
hyperbolic, and parabolic actions. We stress that once the ﬁxed points of the ray-
transfer matrix are known, one can ensure that Q′ will lie in the orbit associated to
Q.

3. First-order systems as transformations in the Poincar´e unit disc D

To complete the geometrical setting introduced in the previous Section, we explore
now a remarkable transformation (introduced by Cayley) that maps bijectively the
hyperbolic plane H onto the unit disc, denoted by D. This can be done via the
unitary matrix

In other words, the matrices M belong to the group SU(1, 1), which plays an essential

for a direct translation of the properties from one to the other.

beam by means of the associated orbits. As an application of the formalism, we
consider the illustrative example of an optical cavity consisting of two spherical mirrors
of radii R1 and R2, separated a distance d. The ray-transfer matrix corresponding to

expression for the N th power of the matrix M. Although there are several elegant
ways of computing this power [21], we shall instead apply our geometrical picture: the
transformed beam is represented by the point

QN = Ψ[M, QN −1] = Ψ[MN , Q0],

(4.4)

where Q0 denotes the initial point.

Note that all the points QN lie in the orbit associated to the initial point Q0 by
the single round trip, which is determined by its ﬁxed points: the character of these
ﬁxed points determine thus the behaviour of this periodic system. By varying the
parameters g of the resonator we can choose to work in the elliptic, the hyperbolic, or
the parabolic case [43].

To illustrate how this geometrical approach works in practice, in ﬁgure 4.a we have
plotted the sequence of successive iterates obtained for diﬀerent kind of ray-transfer
matrices, according to our previous classiﬁcation. In ﬁgure 4.b we have plotted the
same sequence but in the unit disc, obtained via the unitary matrix U .

In the elliptic case, it is clear that the points QN revolve in the orbit centered at
the ﬁxed point and the system never reaches the real axis. Equivalently, the points
QN never reach the unit circle.
On the contrary, for the hyperbolic and parabolic cases the iterates converge to
one of the ﬁxed points on the real axis, although with diﬀerent laws [44]. In the general
context of scattering by periodic systems this corresponds to the band stop and band
edges, respectively [45–49].

What we conclude from this analysis is that the iterates of hyperbolic and
parabolic actions produce solutions fully unlimited, which are incompatible with our
ideas of a beam. The only beam solutions are thus generated by elliptic actions and,

where ϑ is the parameter in the canonical form KC in equation (2.11). Such a condition
is usually worked out in terms of algebraic arguments using ray-transfer matrices,
although the ﬁnal results apply exclusively to scalar wave ﬁelds.

Finally, we stress that real cavities resonate with vector ﬁelds. The situation
then is far more involved because the vector diﬀraction for (polarized) electric ﬁelds is
more diﬃcult to handle, even for systems with small Fresnel numbers and the ABCD
law does not apply to the corresponding kernel [50]. Exact solutions for these vector
beams have recently appeared [51].
In any case, there is abundant evidence that
the stability condition (4.5) works well. This could be expected, since the transition
to scalar theories captures all the essential physics embodied in the more elaborated
vector analogues [52].

5. Concluding remarks

In this paper, we have provided a geometrical scenario to deal with ﬁrst-order optical
systems. More speciﬁcally, we have reduced the action of any system to a rotation,
a translation or a parallel displacement, according to the magnitude of the trace of
its ray-transfer matrix. These are the basic isometries of the hyperbolic plane H and
also of the Poincar´e unit disc D. We have also provided an approach for a qualitative
examination of the stability condition of an optical resonator.

We hope that this approach will complement the more standard algebraic
techniques and together they will help to obtain a better physical and geometrical
feeling for the properties of ﬁrst-order optical systems.

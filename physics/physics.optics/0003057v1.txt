1 Problem

A linearly polarized plane electromagnetic wave of frequency ω is normally incident on an
opaque screen with a square aperture of edge a.

Show that the wave has a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld once it has passed through the
aperture by an application of Faraday’s Law to a loop parallel to the screen, on the side
away from the source. Deduce the ratio of longitudinal to transverse magnetic ﬁeld, which
is a measure of the diﬀraction angle.

2 Solution

Consider a linearly polarized wave with electric ﬁeld Exei(kz−ωt) incident on a perfectly ab-
sorbing screen in the plane z = 0 with a square aperture of edge a centered on the origin.
We apply the integral form of Faraday’s Law to a semicircular loop with its straight edge
bisecting the aperture and parallel to the transverse electric ﬁeld Ex, as shown in the ﬁgure.
The electric ﬁeld is essentially zero close to the screen on the side away from the source.
Then, at time t = 0,

I E · dl ≈ Ex a 6= 0.

(1)

If the loop were on the source side of the screen, the integral would vanish.

Faraday’s Law tells us immediately that the time derivative of the magnetic ﬂux through
the loop is nonzero. Hence, there must be a nonzero longitudinal component, Bz, to the
magnetic ﬁeld, once the wave has passed through the aperture.

where Bz is a characteristic value of the longitudinal component of the magnetic ﬁeld over
that half of the aperture enclosed by the loop. The longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld certainly has
time dependence of the form e−iωt, so dBz/dt = −iωBz = −2πicBz/λ, and (2) leads to

By a similar argument for a loop that enclosed the other half of the aperture, Bz/By ≈ iλ/πa
in that region; Bz = 0 in the plane y = 0.

Figure 1: A screen with a square aperture of edge a is illuminated by a
linearly polarized electromagnetic wave. The imaginary loop shown by the
dashed curve lies close to the screen, on the side away from the source, and so
is partly in the shadow of the wave.

We see that the wave is no longer a plane wave after passing through the aperture, and

we can say that it has been diﬀracted as a consequence of Faraday’s Law.

This argument emphasizes the ﬁelds near the aperture. A detailed understanding of the
ﬁelds far from the aperture requires more than just Faraday’s Law. A simpliﬁed analysis is
that that magnitude of the ratio (3) is a measure of the spread of angles of the magnetic
ﬁeld vector caused by the diﬀraction, and so in the far zone the wave occupies a cone a
characteristic angle λ/πa.

3 Comments

Using the fourth Maxwell equation including the displacement current, we can make an
argument for diﬀraction of the electric ﬁeld similar to that given above for the magnetic
ﬁeld.

After the wave has passed through the aperture of size a, it is very much like a wave
that has been brought to a focus of size a. Hence, we learn that near the focus (x, y, z) =
(0, 0, 0) of a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave with E = E ˆx and propagating in the z
direction, there are both longitudinal electric and magnetic ﬁelds, and that Ez and Bz are
antisymmetric about the planes x = 0 and y = 0, respectively.

Also, eq. (3) indicates that near the focus the longitudinal and transverse ﬁelds are 90◦

out of phase. Yet, far from the focus, the transverse and longitudinal ﬁelds become in phase,
resulting in spherical wavefronts that extend over a cone of characteristic angle λ/πa. For
this to hold, the longitudinal and the transverse ﬁelds must experience phase shifts that
diﬀer by 90◦ between the focal point and the far zone.

It is only a slight leap from the present argument to conclude that the transverse ﬁelds
undergo the extra phase shift. This was ﬁrst deduced (or noticed) by Guoy [1] in 1890 via
the Huygens-Kirchhoﬀ integral [2]. The latter tells us that the secondary wavelet ψ at a
large distance r from a small region of area A where the wave amplitude is ψ0e−iωt is

ψ =

The possibly mysterious factor of i in the denominator of the Huygens-Kirchhoﬀ integral
implies a 90◦ phase shift between a focus and the far ﬁeld of a beam of light. Here, we have
seen that this phase shift can also be considered as a consequence of Faraday’s Law.

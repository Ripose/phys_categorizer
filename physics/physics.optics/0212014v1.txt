Few Cycle Optical Pulse Propagation: a detailed calculation

(Dated: February 19, 2013)

This document contains my detailed calculation of the Generalised Few-cycle Envelope Approximation (GFEA)
propagation equation reported and used in Phys. Rev. A (submitted) [1] and its associated longer version at
arXiv.org [2]. This GFEA propagation equation is intended to be applicable to optical pulses only a few cycles long,
a regime where the standard Slowly Varying Envelope Approximation (SVEA) fails.

The calculation is intended to be as complete as possible, but is still a “work in progress”, and so may, despite my
best eﬀorts, contain occaisional mistakes. It is an edited version of a longer document from which on-going work has
been excised. Please contact me if you have any comments, corrections or queries.

[*] I worked at this institution while doing the bulk of this calculation. My main project was with Prof. G.H.C.

New on few-cycle optical pulses, and I was funded with money from the EPSRC.

INTRODUCTION

This report is a calculation intended to generate an evolution equation for an envelope approximation description
of pulse propagation in the few-cycle regime. I try to fully investigate each step and approximation, include all the
algebra, and discuss any subtleties that may arise.

The calculation parallels and extends that in ⋆⋆ T. Brabec, F. Krausz, “Nonlinear optical pulse propagation in
the single-cycle regime” [3]. I also (amongst other things) make some comments about their slowly-evolving-wave-
approximation (SEWA).

The calculation includes all the steps taken from the Brabec and Krausz[3] starting point of (their eqn.(1))

better, but which neglects the nonlinearity, giving their SEEA equation:

where the 1 + ıδ results from a 1 + ∂t/ω term acting on the polarization, which has a linearly decaying memory
with characteristic time T2 (and δ = (ωT2)−1 ); dispersion and diﬀraction are not included. It is seems plausible that
we can get from eqn (1.2) to (1.5) – we scale the variables (the ∂t will disappear with a co-moving frame), neglect
diﬀraction, neglect dispersion, and introduce the same polarization model. Etc. This will be clearer as we follow the
full calculation in the next sections.

An early review of attempts to describe ultra-short pulse propagation was given by Lamb [6].

II. ENVELOPES AND CARRIERS

The substitution used in the “envelope approximation” is just a splitting of a general waveform (of e.g. the electric
ﬁeld amplitude) into two parts, an “envelope”, and a “carrier”; where the carrier part is intended to carry almost all
of the oscilliatory part of the waveform. It is usual to describe a plane-polarised wave, with the B ﬁeld perpendicular
to, in phase with, and proportional to (in amplitude) the E ﬁeld. It is also possible to do such a calculation with
circularly polarized ﬁeld variables [7] (using Ec = Ex + ıEy rather than just Ex).

For a forwardly propagating carrier exp [ı (β0z − ω0t + ψ0)] and an envelope A(~r⊥, z, t), the substitution is

E(~r, t) = A(~r⊥, z, t)eı(β0z−ω0t+ψ0) + A∗(~r⊥, z, t)e−ı(β0z−ω0t+ψ0)

= A(~r⊥, z, t)eıΞ−
Ξ∓ = (β0z ∓ ω0t + ψ0) .

+ A∗(~r⊥, z, t)e−ıΞ−

,

(2.1)

(2.2)
(2.3)

Note that the carrier is forward propagating because of the chosen signs on the wavevector (β0) and frequency (ω0)
parts: both terms in eqn.(2.2) are forward propagating (c.f. a wave described by e.g. f (x − vt)). Also note that the
Poynting vector for the carrier ﬁeld also has a direction, given by E ×B – and here B is determined by E (c.f. Fleck[5]’s
approach). Using a forward carrier means that any backward propagating components that happen to be in the E
waveform need to be contained in the envelope – unless extra backward carrier terms are added to the substitution
above. However, since in many useful situations an initially forwardly propagating wave does not develope a signiﬁcant
backward propagating component, we can use approximations to work in a regime where backward contributions are
negligible, rather than complicate our representation of the E waveform: a forward+backward carrier equation might
look like this:

E(~r, t) = A(~r⊥, z, t)eı(β0z−ω0t+ψ+) + A∗(~r⊥, z, t)e−ı(β0z−ω0t+ψ+)

+B(~r⊥, z, t)eı(β0z+ω0t+ψ−) + B∗(~r⊥, z, t)e−ı(β0z+ω0t+ψ−).

(2.4)

Typically we then try to factor the carrier part out of our equations of motion for the waveform, and simplify the
envelope equation of motion by making approximations based on assumptions of (e.g.) smoothness of the envelope, the
small contributions from backward propagating terms, and so on. This then leaves us with a (hopefully) manageable
equation for just the envelope function. Note that our choice of carrier frequency is only constrained by the need to
keep the approximations manageable.

One point with the use of the envelope function substitution is that any phase-like properties of the waveform become
obscured. This is because they can be contained in either (or both) the carrier and the envelope. An alternative
choice in the phase of the carrier (e.g. replacing ψ0 with some ψ′
0 6= ψ0) will in fact mean that the envelope function
is diﬀerent. Plotted on a graph, this can seem to have a large eﬀect, particularly for a few-cycle pulse, where the peak
of the waveform moves about noticeably if the phase of the carrier is changed in a envelope-carrier pair – see ﬁg. 1
and comments in Brabec and Krausz[3] for some analysis.

Note however that the envelope (and carrier) are complex – and a phase shift of exp [ı (ψ′

0 − ψ0)] in the carrier
can be exactly matched by a ﬁxed shift of exp [−ı (ψ′
0 − ψ0)] in the envelope. This means there is no calculational or
simulation problem associated with shifting the carrier phase, as long as the envelope is also adjusted. What matters
is that the real E ﬁeld waveform resulting from a envelope-carrier pair is correct according to the boundary/initial
conditions. Confusion can only occur from the point of view of an envelope-only picture of the pulse shape.

In the usual case of a pulse that is long compared to its natural carrier frequency, the envelope should be smooth and
so the relationship between the underlying carrier phase and the electric ﬁeld E() is often ignored, or, if not ignored,
then can be regarded as speciﬁed by the many oscillations in E at the carrier frequency. This tend to lead one towards
an “envelope only” view of the pulse, which can later cause confusion for few-cycle pulses where a diﬀerent choice of
carrier phase leads to a diﬀerent looking envelope on a E vs z (or t) graph, where only the real part is plotted. For
some kind of complex plot, we would clearly see that these diﬀerent looking envelopes are complex rotations of each
other, and their “diﬀerences” are merely an artifact (but see the following subsection).

A. A Phase Function

Some authors (e.g. [6, 8]) use a separate phase function ψ(~r, t) in order to ensure their envelope function remains

real. In this case the deﬁnition in eqn.(2.3) looks like

E(~r, t) = AR(~r⊥, z, t)eı(β0z−ω0t+ψ(~r,t)) + AR(~r⊥, z, t)e−ı(β0z−ω0t+ψ(~r,t)).

(2.5)

Whilst this might look like a good idea, it complicates any kind of propagation equation for the pulse envelope that
we might derive: it would now contain additional derivative terms (of the phase function) and also we would need a
propagation equation for the phase function itself. Further, this phase function is ambiguous (recall ψ + θ is the same
angle as θ), would be undeﬁned (or any value) when AR is zero, and numerically diﬃcult to handle when AR is small.

I do not use this sort of phase function in this document.

B. A Single Envelope Represents a Set of Pulses

For a given set of initial conditions (usually just the electric ﬁeld proﬁle of the input pulse(s), we might pick any
value of carrier phase we liked. Each diﬀerent value of carrier phase would result in a diﬀerent pulse envelope – but
each of the resulting combinations of carrier phase and envelope will specify the same initial conditions.

So, starting with a ﬁxed ﬁeld, you can use a variety of carrier choices, and end up with a variety of envelopes. After
solving for the propagation of the chosen “initial state” envelope, we get a “ﬁnal state” envelope. From this we can
reconstruct a unique ﬁnal state E ﬁeld. This parallels the left hans side of Fig. 1.

But note since a given envelope may be turned back into an electric ﬁeld by applying any values for carrier phase,
this ﬁnal state envelope can be used to generate a range of ﬁnal state electric ﬁelds. Each of these ﬁelds corresponds
to the initial condition speciﬁed by the initial state envelope and that same choice of carrier phase.

So one envelope simulation provides a range of Ei → Ef solutions, as indicated diagramatically on ﬁg. 1.
Note that for polarization terms with their own dynamics (e.g. a two level atom, see my report Two level atoms
and the few cycle regime [9]), the choice of carrier phase alters not only the pulse envelopes but also the representation
of the initial polarization state.

C. The so-called “carrier phase”, i.e. the pulse phase

Many authors publishing on short pulses refer to “the carrier phase”. By this they seem to mean something derived
by comparing an inferred ﬁeld envelope to the peaks and troughs of the actual (oscillating) electric ﬁeld. For example,
they might take the distance between the peak of the envelope as their zero (i.e. the point of reference), and the peak
of the nearest electric ﬁeld oscillation as giving the ﬁeld phase (see ﬁg 2). A good example of this is the paper by
Chelkowski and Bandrauk [10]. To work, this “maximum amplitude” procedure assumes a number of things:

(a1) The envelope has a single peak: Of course this is not always true. Further, even if it does happen in some

particular case to be true, that peak is not always well localised – such as in ﬂat-topped pulses.

(a2) The pulse does not have a complex phase structure: Of course it is straightforward to generate real val-
ued envelopes from an oscillating electric ﬁeld proﬁle, as the electric ﬁeld is real valued. However, if (e.g.) the
pulse is chirped, the electric ﬁeld oscillations will no longer have a ﬁxed frequency, so it is not possible to use
and envelope-peak to ﬁeld-peak distance to guess a phase without additional assumptions.

I believe it is unhelpful to talk of “carrier phase” in the contexts the term is usually applied. From a mathematical
point of view, there are two phases: the carrier phase, and the envelope phase; further, the envelope phase may well
have a complicated structure that obscures or overrides the role of the carrier phase. The carrier phase should be
ﬁxed according to some spatio-temporal reference point, then further discussions along the lines of “the phase of the
pulse” should refer to the envelope phase, and so the phase structure of the pulse will not so easily be ignored or
sidestepped. However, in the event that a single phase parameter is appropriate or desirable, a clearly deﬁned method
should be used to extract it, avoiding unreliable and subjective arguments about which value of the phase proﬁle of
the envelope is “the phase”.

III. EXTENDING BRABEC AND KRAUSZ: THE POST-TRANSFORM ENVELOPE

Brabec and Krausz[3] consider the case of small transverse inhomogeneities of the polarization, and so start with

the three dimensional wave equation

The (cid:13)± gc

n ∂z is a new term include to allow the calculation to apply to the G± Fleck[5] variables. For normal cases
set g = 0 and forget it. Here I use an alternative “±” sign: (cid:13)± – this is to distinguish this variable sign from a later
(and independent) variable sign ± cause by the choice of carrier direction.

A. The linear electric susceptibility

Now we need to treat the eﬀects of the linear electric susceptibility. We start by fourier transforming the equation
using exp (−ıωt); but neglecting to keep track of the normalisation, since this will take care of itself when we transform
back. Using the correspondance ∂t ↔ −ıω, the ﬁrst LH term is simple, and transforms to:

The RH term is also simple, and transforms to:

If the upper limit of the dt′ integral was t and not ∞, the dt′ integral part would be the normal convolution integral;
hence we could convert it into the product of the fourier transforms of its constituents. This could be justiﬁed by
saying ǫ must be causal, and so is 0 for any t′ > t, hence the limits of the integral can be extended to +∞.

Now I might want to expand ˜ǫ(ω) in powers of ω, but to make things easier I’ll replace it with the k2(ω) and expand

k about ωǫ instead. Using ˜ǫ(ω) = c2k(ω)2/ω2 (as do Brabec and Krausz[3]) and then

βn, αn ∈ R; αn = Im(γn), βn = Re(γn).

(3.10)

Note that Brabec and Krausz[3] have αn/2 in their equations where my deﬁnitions will give αn. This is because
the deﬁnition Brabec and Krausz[3] give for αn (below their eqn. (BK3)) is not the one they actually use. The one
they use is consistent with α corresponding to the decay in the intensity, not the ﬁeld; and in fact Porras[4] alters

Dr.Paul.Kinsler@physics.org
http://www.kinsler.org/physics/

his deﬁnition of αn from that stated by Brabec and Krausz[3] (and me) in order to have terms like αn/2 appear.
Porras[4], despite his diﬀerent deﬁnition, is consistent with my calculations. The αn that Brabec and Krausz[3] use
is the same as that deﬁned by Porras[4]; and both Brabec and Krausz[3] and Porras[4] use ωǫ = ω0.

Using this expansion, the equation becomes

B. The envelope and carrier

Now I split the ﬁeld up into an envelope part and a forwardly propagating carrier-wave part using the substitution

E(~r, t) = A(~r⊥, z, t)eı(β0z∓ω0t+ψ0) + A∗(~r⊥, z, t)e−ı(β0z∓ω0t+ψ0)

= A(~r⊥, z, t)eıΞ∓

,

(3.14)

(3.15)

and similarly for Pnl(~r, t) = B(~r⊥, z, t; A)eıΞ∓

. The symbol Ξ∓ is introduced purely as a
convenient shorthand notation for the terms in the exponential; and the minus sign (i.e. Ξ−) refers to a forwardly prop-
agating carrier, and plus sign (i.e. Ξ+) a backwardly propagating carrier. With these envelope-carrier substitutions,
the equation of motion becomes

Here Υ∓ = (ωǫ ∓ ω0) /ω0, which is a quantity which usually would be set to zero – but retaining it allows me to
expand the dispersion around a frequency other than ω0. Note the usage of Υ∓ and ωǫ is clumsy, because we need to
alter its sign under complex conjugation; carrier direction reversal is taken care of with the ± notation.

I now split eqn (3.17) into two separate equations, the ﬁrst “A equation” containing the terms like eıΞ∓

, and the
. These two equations are simply the complex conjugates of one

second “A∗ equation” containing the terms like e−ıΞ∓
another, and so writing down only the ﬁrst one is suﬃcient:

This is simpliﬁed with number of minor steps: dividing by the eıΞ∓

extracting factors of ∓ω0 from the RHS ( ⇒ (∓ıω0 + ∂t) = (∓ıω0 ∓ ıω0∂t/(∓ıω0)) = ∓ıω0(1 + ∂t/(∓ıω0) = ∓ıω0(1 ∓

This appears to diﬀer slightly from Bracbec-Krausz eqn.(2) in that it has the opposite sign on the RHS – however,

agreement is recovered later in eqn.(3.48).

If A0 is a solution of the A equation, then its conjugate A∗

0 is a solution of the conjugate A∗ equation. This means
that solving one solves the other, and a total waveform can then be easily reconstructed using eqn (3.15). There are
no approximations made in doing this, but it may be that there are complicated (or subtle) cases where solutions of
the full equation are not expressible in terms of solutions of the two separate ones.

Note that for the forward propagating carrier (Ξ−, the upper sign choice in Ξ∓), there are no explicitly backward
propagating terms, despite the fact that we have not excluded them in any way – this is because they do not
arise spontaneously, but need to be created. Such an eﬀect could occur in the case of multi-ﬁeld systems or exotic
polarization behaviour, where there may well be spatially oscillating terms from the nonlinear polarization term B
( e.g. exp (±ıkBz)) which could force a (possibly backward propagating) oscillation onto A. This would very likely
violate some approximation we will want to make later, e.g. a “smooth” or slowly varying envelope function A. We
can only neglect backward propagating components if (a) there were none to start with, and (b) by verifying (or
assuming) that the nonlinear polarization has convenient properties – although we could extend eqn (3.15) to include
backward carrier terms as already discussed (see section II).

At the equivalent point to eqn.(3.21) in the Bracbec-Krausz paper, they already claim to have neglected backward
propagating waves (after their eqn (1)): “the neglect of backward propagating waves is consistent with the approx-
imations that will be made in the following derivation of the envelope equation and will be commented on later”
– their comment being that “excessive” change in the envelope can lead to backwardly propagating components to
the envelope (see e.g. Shen [11]). I, however, leave any approximations relating to the neglect of backward terms
to later on – it is still the case that (in principle) that the envelope function might contain backwardly propagating
components.

This diﬀers from Fleck[5] in that his E± and E ± (G+ and G+ in my notation) are constructed as explicitly forward
and backward propagating, and hence should not really be compared directly to my E or A. My E is in fact Fleck[5]’s
E+ + E− (G+ + G−), and somewhere in the approximations used to get to my starting point eqn.(3.1) the magnetic
ﬁeld parts (retained by Fleck[5]) have been assumed to be solely dependent on (deriveable from) the electric ﬁeld. See
my derivation “A second-order wave equation using Fleck ﬁeld variables”[12] for more information.

C. Scaled co-moving variables

I now change into a scaled co-moving reference frame, but one slightly diﬀerent to that of Bracbec-Krausz – the
diﬀerence being that I scale space by β0 and the time by ω0 as well as shifting the origin. Bracbec-Krausz and Porros
use ξ = z and τ = t ∓ β1z, but I instead put

8

ξ = β′
0z,
τ = ω0 (t ∓ β′

1z) .

(3.22)
(3.23)

(3.24)

(3.25)

(3.26)

Here I use β′

0 and β′

1 rather than just β0 and β1 because it may not always be convenient to use the natural scaled
co-moving reference frame; which might well be the case for solving multi-mode problems. For an A∗ equation, the
signs of both z and t should be reversed so that ξ− = −β′
1z). Do not think that this A∗
frame (for Ξ−, upper sign) is backwardly propagating, since although ξ− ∼ −z, time has also reversed τ− ∼ −t. The
derivatives for the A equation transform like

1/β0, and used the
fact that the refractive index at ω0 is n0 = cβ0/ω0. I also deﬁne a dispersion term ˆD in a similar way to Brabec and
Krausz[3], but instead use a scaled (dimensionless) version ˆD′ in following equations:

D. Aside: Brabec and Krausz approximation criteria

Brabec and Krausz[3] introduce some criteria designed to motivate approximations to their equations (BK5a,b,c).
Since I use the same variable names, but diﬀerently scaled, I here write the Brabec and Krausz[3] criteria in their
form on the LHS, and indicate with an arrow my form on the RHS.

Note that g = 0 here. The motivation for the ﬁrst two (5a,b) are obvious from eqn.(3.31), in my scaled co-moving
(cid:12)
frame – they allow me to say certain quantities are small, and hence I could choose to neglect them. In contrast,
it is not clear how the third condition will make my equations simpler beyond removing a single prefactor (since
|ω0β1/β0| ≈ 1); but |ω0β1/β0| ≪ 1 might seem better still, if perhaps not as physically relevant. However, Brabec
and Krausz[3] collect their terms together diﬀerently, and indeed the situation becomes clearer after I rearrange the
eqations.

E. The Generalised Few-Cycle Envelope equation

I keep (∓Υ − ı∂τ ) terms intact because for the usual case where ωǫ = ω0 is chosen, they will simplify to −ı∂τ . Note
0 rather than the single β0 of Brabec and Krausz[3]. Still retaining all

also I have divided the equation through by β2

(3.42)

This equation (3.42) has a nice 1 + ı(α0/β0 − ı ˆD′) term which may be useful in a generic “small dispersion” case.
However, we want to reach the more typical Brabec and Krausz[3] (or Porras[4]) form; and so instead continue with
the algebra from eqn.(3.41). Like Porras[4], I retain the natural choice of 1 + ıσ∂τ multiplier for the ∂ξ term. This
diﬀers from the 1 + ı∂τ used by Brabec and Krausz[3], and is why Porras[4] claims that the Brabec and Krausz[3]
SEWA equation has the space-time focussing “slightly falsiﬁed”, mentioning Rothenburg[13] – it is because Brabec
and Krausz[3] had already introduced a σ = 1 approximation, and as such the “missing” σ is an approximation, not
anything “slightly falsiﬁed”.

Presumably Brabec and Krausz[3] used their eqn. (BK4) to motivate their (BK5c) σ ≃ 1 to get a (1 + ı∂τ ) term
— because they wanted to cancel the same factor from the nonlinear term multiplying B(~r⊥, ξ, τ ; A). This can be
contrasted with Porras[4], who was not interested in the nonlinear case but wanted instead to cancel terms in the
“∇2
⊥” diﬀraction (or self-focusing) term. In fact using Brabec and Krausz[3] eqn. (BK4) as a midpoint on the way
to Brabec and Krausz[3] eqn. (BK6) is not the best path, even for Brabec and Krausz[3] – their early selection of a
(1 + ı∂τ ) prefactor for ∂ξ is unnecessary. I show this here, but ﬁrst hide all the Υ dependent terms in TΥ (as they are
usually zero anyway), and the rest of the RHS terms in TRHS because they remain unchanged.

After some sign changes caused by moving factors of ı from the denominator to the numerator, and by moving one

inside a set of () brackets, we get

Now to avoid overly complex equations I set σ′ = ±σ (i.e. β′

1 = β1), and a carrier appropriate to the group velocity
by choosing the upper sign), forcing the τ scaling for the ﬁeld to match the material rather than (e.g.) another ﬁeld.
Note that in the case of multiple ﬁeld components with diﬀerent group velocities, it may be necessary to have β′
1 6= β1
in order to keep all of the co-moving frames aligned.

One ﬁnal step now gives us a Generalised Few-Cycle Envelope equation for a propagating pulse in a nonlinear
medium. It is in the style of Brabec and Krausz[3], but unlike that of Brabec and Krausz[3] (and of Porras[4]), it has
no approximations beyond that from the starting point, the permittivity convolution, and the separation of A and
A∗ propagation equations. Remembering to expand the TRHS and TΥ terms as necessary, with g = 0, we have the

We might prefer to handle the nonlinear term by basing it on (1 + ı∂τ ), for example if we intended to neglect the
diﬀraction term entirely (e.g. as in Brabec and Krausz[3]). By starting at eqn (3.48) we see the possibility of a nice
expansion in δ = 1 − σ by simply replacing the entire B prefactor term in eqn (3.48) with:

It would be better, of course, to expand the few cycle term to a ﬁxed order explicitly – there will be many expansions
like the above, that when truncated to ﬁrst order, are correct to within terms of second order; but which diﬀer from
each other by amounts that are also of second order. So:

It is interesting that this sytematic expansion gives yet another ﬁrst order correction to the non linear polarization
– but of course it only diﬀers from Brabec and Krausz’s [3] and Porras’s [4] by terms like (1 − σ) ∂τ , which are second
order corrections. Note again that Brabec and Krausz work in the case σ = 1, whereas Porras allows σ 6= 1, but does
not consider nonlinear processes.

IV. APPROXIMATIONS: SEWA, SEEA, AND GFEA

The full generalised few-cycle equation (3.48) has a rather complicated prefactor for the polarization term, and also
the “extra” TRHS term. If we want to make approximations that reduce it to Brabec and Krausz’s SEWA (slowly
evolving wave approximation), Porras’s[4] SEEA (slowly evolving envelope approximation), or some other form then
we need to consider these terms in detail, and understand in what limits these terms might be simpliﬁed or neglected.
Note that setting TΥ = 0 is a matter of chosen convention, and is not an approximation of any kind.

For example, Brabec and Krausz[3] have a discussion in their PRL on p3284, after their eqn.(8) about the various
criteria that need to hold for their SEWA to be valid, all of which are that various quantities must be slowly varying
as the pulse propagates along ξ. It is also instructive to see what parameter values or what terms are neglected to
see how my generalised equation (3.48) reduces to Brabec and Krausz’s SEWA (slowly evolving wave approxima-
tion), Porras[4]’s SEEA (slowly evolving envelope approximation), or to my GFEA (generalised few-cycle envelope
approximation), which is in some sense equivalent to a “best of” combination of the two others.

1. SEWA: Brabec and Krausz[3] eqn.(6). In eqn. (3.48), set σ = 1, use TΥ = 0 (since ωǫ = ω0)and ignore TRHS:

The advantage of the generalised eqn. (3.48) over these is that I could easily put σ = 1 − δ and do an expansion

for small δ and go beyond both Brabec and Krausz[3] and Porras[4].

The main point of complication with the generalised equation is the TRHS term, as it is second order in ∂τ and
∂ξ, as well as having higher order terms in ∂τ from the diﬀraction contribution ˆD′. These same terms (or simpliﬁed
versions) were also neglected by both Brabec and Krausz[3] and Porras[4]. Since the equation would be considerably
easier to solve if TRHS were negligible, I will examine it in carefully in order to see what justiﬁcation or constraints
are required to do so. The term is:

Clearly this TRHS needs to be small compared to the other terms in eqn. (3.48) if it is to be neglected. If it happens
that it is small, then the other, non-negligible, terms sum to close to ∂ξA(~r⊥, ξ, τ ). So we can self-consistently ignore
TRHS if the following condition holds:

A nice way of dealing with the presence of the ∂τ terms is to fourier transform into the freqency domain, where

This enables us to avoid speculation about the possible time derivatives of A, and instead constrain its frequency
components. However, this assumes knowlege of the all-time behaviour of the terms under consideration, so when
being careful it might be better to use a time-windowed transform or similar. This could then give us constraints valid
over some ﬁnite timescale relevant to the dynamics, without having to deal directly with instantaneous derivatives.

The condition (4.5) can be broken into two parts, which are

The second of these I assume holds as a further consequence of the “ﬁrst order” dispersion condition (4.13)

[SeeRef:d0] below.

I can now constrain the evolution of the pulse in ξ by evaluating how to ensure that the ∂2

ξ terms is negligible.

slightly when propagated over distances ξ ∼ 1 (i.e. z ∼ 1/β0), and as such will depend on other terms in the evolution
equation.
SeeNote:d0: There may be complications I do not see, because these terms ( ˆD′, etc) do contain derivative terms.

Note that we could use the alternative eqn (3.50) in condition (4.15).
I will assume condition (4.13) implies that (4.8) also holds [SeeRef:d0], leaving us with four conditions in total
(4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.15). Note that Brabec and Krausz[3] split (4.13) into multiple pieces, which will be discussed in
the following subsection.

B. Dispersion: ∂τ Approximation

I will now treat the dispersion condition (4.13) in the above approximations and associated conditions. Note that
Brabec and Krausz[3] claim that their SEWA “does not explicitly impose a limitation on the pulse width”; however
this is rather misleading as shortly afterward they introduce a pulse duration τp which is used in the inequalities
constraining the material parameters, which then give the region of validity of the SEWA. Even the weakest statement
we might make about τp needs to state that it does constrain the SEWA, because it (further) constrains the material
parameters! For a given set of material parameters, there will be some pulse width limitation, although it might well
be the few-cycles we hope to describe.

I now break up eqn. (4.13) into parts containing single factors of γm. Note that I need to exclude any terms
m = γm for m ≥ 2, and

including β0 and β1 in γm as they were treated separately in the analysis. I thus write γ′
0 = α0, γ′

where the second line has been fourier transformed in time. Note that while both ω0 and γ′ have units, Ω does not,

as it is the counterpart of the dimensionless (scaled) τ (see (4.6)).
To Do: Now get from Ω to a τδ or Brabec and Krausz[3] τp, by some physical motivation justifying τδ = 2π/Ω.

I could treat the time-domain condition (4.16) qualitatively as follows: introduce τδ ≃ A/ |∂τ A|, the time for which
a rate of change of ∂τ A would accumulate (in absolute value) to A; and is thus some measure of how much time it
takes the envelope to change signiﬁcantly, and is thus hopefully something we can relate to the pulse width (or at
least the width of one “bump” on the pulse envelope). Also, we assume that the higher derivatives of A are related,
with |∂m
[SeeRef:x1]. This is essentially the same parameter as Brabec and Krausz[3]’s τp, but
scaled into my dimensionless picture: τp ≡ τδ/ω0. Using this τδ we can rewrite eqn. (4.16) as

SeeNote:x1:: The factoring of the m! into ∂m
to the terms in Taylor expansions, and expansions of exponential functions (etc).
Note: Is it possible to derive a true time-domain treatment of the constraints by replacing the γm by ∂ωk(ω), and
relate it back to the time domain ǫ(t − t0) (or moments thereof).
Note: the eqn. (4.8) ˆD′2 terms.

Treating the ∂τ in condition (4.14) by fourier transform, as above, we can use the fact that for gaussian beams with
0 ; similar statements could be made for other typical beam proﬁles.

a beam waist w0, we have ∇2
This leads to the diﬀraction constraint on the SEWA becoming

⊥A(~r⊥, ξ, τ ) ∼ w−2

0 ≫ 1.

(4.20)

Comparing this to the comparable condition in Brabec and Krausz[3] after their eqn (8) (i.e. in my units β2

0 ≫ 1),
we see that they are the same except for the Ω term, so that my condition is in fact somewhat less restrictive than
theirs. This is because considering positive frequencies only means that Ω > 0; and Ω ∼ 1 for ∂τ modulations much
less than the variation of the carrier frequency.

D. Nonlinearity: B(~r⊥, ξ, τ ; A) approximations

The nonlinearity constraint (4.15) is very complicated, so I ignore the term in square brackets [...]. Then, treating
the ∂τ in condition (4.15) by fourier transform, as above, and using σ ≃ 1, the nonlinearity constraint on the SEWA
becomes

(4.21)

Comparing this to the comparable condition in Brabec and Krausz[3] after their eqn (BK8), we see that the same
comments as for the diﬀraction hold – my condition is somewhat less restrictive than theirs. Of course it may be
convenient to simplify the LHS of eqn. (4.21) with various small Ω expansions.

In both cases I could instead include the ∂τ corrections qualitatively by replacing ∂τ → τ −1

before proceeding from

δ

(4.14) and (4.15); but even with τδ ≃ 1 this will not alter the contraints greatly.

Optical Filter Measured by Microwave Network
Analyzer

Abstract— The phase and amplitude responses of a narrow-
band optical ﬁlter are measured simultaneously using a mi-
crowave network analyzer. The measurement is based on an
interferometric arrangement to split light into two paths and
then combine them. In one of the two paths, a Mach-Zehnder
modulator generates two tones without carrier and the narrow-
band optical ﬁlter just passes through one of the tones. The
temperature and environmental variations are removed by sepa-
rated phase and amplitude averaging. The amplitude and phase
responses of the optical ﬁlter are measured to the resolution and
accuracy of the network analyzer.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE chromatic dispersion, or equivalently the phase re-

sponse, of a narrow-band optical ﬁlter is always difﬁcult
to measure. When the widely used modulation phase-shift
method [1], [2] is applied for narrow-band measurement, both
the accuracy and resolution are limited [3]. Typical measure-
ment equipment of the phase-shift method quotes the resolu-
tion of the tunable laser as the resolution for dispersion mea-
surement that is actually limited by the modulation frequency.
High modulation frequency gives better phase accuracy but
limits the frequency or wavelength accuracy or resolution
bandwidth. Low modulation frequency gives better frequency
accuracy but limits the phase accuracy. Dual-frequency phase-
shift method may obtain better accuracy [4].

Recently, narrow-band optical ﬁlter was used for time-
resolved optical ﬁltering (TROF) to simultaneously measure
the amplitude and phase of an optical signal with [5] or
without chromatic dispersion [6]. The dual of frequency-
resolved optical gating (FROG) [7], TROF needs an accurate
tunable narrow-band optical ﬁlter to obtain the spectrogram.
Ideally, the tunable optical ﬁlter of [8] in the measurement of
[5], [6] does not have dispersion. An accurate measurement is

required to conﬁrm the dispersionless assumption in [5], [6],
[8].

Optical ﬁlter or its equivalent is widely used in dense
wavelength-division-multiplexed (DWDM) systems [9], [10].
The group delay ripples of DWDM ﬁlter should be minimized
for better system performance [3]. Typical DWDM systems
have channel spacing of 50 or 100 GHz, corresponding to
a wavelength separation of 0.4 or 0.8 nm. Future DWDM
systems may potentially have narrow channel spacing using
narrow-band optical ﬁlters [11].

Narrow-band optical ﬁlter is recently used for chirp control
[12]–[15]. Those optical ﬁlters for chirp control typically have
a narrower bandwidth than DWDM applications. The phase
response or dispersion for those chirp control ﬁlters should not
induce further chirp into the signal. Conventional modulation
phase-shift method is not accurate for those narrow-band
optical ﬁlters.

Unlike modulation phase-shift method suitable for wide-
band devices like optical ﬁber [2], an interferometric method is
used here to simultaneously measure the amplitude and phase
responses of a narrow-band optical ﬁlter using a wide-band
microwave network analyzer. The responses of the optical ﬁlter
are measured to the amplitude and frequency accuracy of the
network analyzer. When the optical ﬁlter of [5], [6], [8] is
measured, the frequency resolution is down to 25 MHz and
the frequency accuracy or resolution bandwidth is down to 1
kHz. The measurement result is crucial for TROF to retrieve
electric ﬁeld of an optical signal. The interferometric method
here is especially suitable for a narrow-band device.

The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follow-
ing: Sec. II explains the operation principle of the method
to measure the amplitude and phase responses of a narrow-
band optical ﬁlter; Sec. III presents the measurement results
for the double-pass monochromator in [8] with an optical
bandwidth of 5 GHz; and Secs. IV and V are the discussion
and conclusion, respectively.

II. OPERATION PRINCIPLE OF THE MEASUREMENT

Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram for the experimental
setup to characterize a narrow-band optical ﬁlter. The setup of
Fig. 1 is based on a Mach-Zehnder interferometric arrange-
ment. The optical carrier from a narrow linewidth laser source
is splitted into two paths. These two paths are combined after
approximately the same path delay.

and phase responses of a narrow-band optical ﬁlter. (DUT: device-under-test,
PC: Polarization Controller)

The microwave network analyzer is the major equipment
in the setup of Fig. 1. To measure the transfer characteristic
of a device at the microwave frequency of, for example, ωm,
the network analyzer sends a sinusoidal signal at ωm from its
output port. At the same time, the input port receives the signal
after the device-under-test and the amplitude and phase of the
sinusoidal signal at ωm are measured. Equivalently speaking,
there is a very narrow-band electrical ﬁlter centered at ωm
at the receiver and followed by a precision vector voltage
meter to ﬁnd both amplitude and phase. Ideally, both the noise
and interference at other microwave frequencies beyond its
resolution bandwidth do not affect the measurement accuracy.
The upper path of Fig. 1 just passes the signal to the
combiner after some delay. The lower path of Fig. 1 includes
a high-speed Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) driven by the
network analyzer and followed by the narrow-band optical
ﬁlter under test. The combined signal from the two paths
is detected by a fast photodiode and feeds to the network
analyzer. The MZM is operated at the minimum transmission
point. The measurement operates better for a narrow-band
optical ﬁlter with a bandwidth less than ωm.

Ideally, the narrow-band optical ﬁlter has a bandwidth far
smaller than ωm and centers at, for example and without loss
of generality, ωc − ωm, where ωc is the angular frequency
of the laser source. Because of the narrow-band assumption,
the relationship of |H(ωc − ωm)| ≫ |H(ωc + ωm)| is valid,
where H(·) is the frequency response of the narrow-band op-
tical ﬁlter. For better illustration, Figures 2 show the measured
and simulated spectra with ﬁlter centered at ωc − ωm and a
ﬁxed modulation frequency of ωm = 20 GHz for Fig. 1. The
spectra in Fig. 2 are for illustration purpose and the lower path
actually has a frequency ωm less than the upper path due to
the inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength.

Figures 2(a) and (b) are the spectra of the laser source and
output of MZM as measured by an optical spectrum analyzer,
respectively. The spectrum of Fig. 2(a) is a single tone at ωc
that passes directly to the combiner. The spectrum of Fig.
2(b) is the output of the MZM with two tones at ωc ± ωm
as the MZM is biased at the minimum transmission point.
Figures 2(c) and (d) show computer-simulated spectra for the
signal passing through optical ﬁlter and after the combiner.
The spectrum of Fig. 2(c) shows that the optical ﬁlter just
passes through one of the tones of the MZM output of Fig.
2(b). The spectrum of Fig. 2(d) is the combination of the
spectrum of Figs. 2(a) and (c) for the signal after the combiner.

The correct operation of the setup requires that the two tones
of the combined signal of Fig. 2(d) is separated by ωm, the
same angular frequency for the driving signal of the microwave
network analyzer.

The output signal of the upper path of Fig. 1, ignores some
factors of constant delay and constant loss, is proportional
to E1(t) = E0 exp (jωct), where ωc and E0 are the angular
frequency and the complex envelope of the laser source. The
spectrum of the signal at upper path is the same as that from
laser source shown in Fig. 2(a).

The drive signal

to the MZM is assumed as s(t) =
Am sin(ωmt + ϕm), where Am and ϕm are amplitude and
phase of the driving signal, respectively. Here, we assume that
both Am and ϕm are two known constants. In practice, both
Am and ϕm depend on the frequency responses of the network
analyzer output driver, modulator driver, and MZM that can be
calibrated out together with some other factors. Ignored some
constant factors, the MZM with minimum bias and modulated
signal s(t) has output of [16]

tonic mixer [18]. With minimum-biased operation, the electric
ﬁeld at the MZM output is

The MZM output of (2) is the tones at ωc ± (2k + 1)ωm and
dominates by the ﬁrst-order tone of ωc ± ωm. In terms of
power, the power given by the term of J1(βm) is about 30-dB
larger than J3(βm) for modulation index of βm smaller than
0.85. The measured spectrum of Fig. 2(b) just has two major
tones at ωc ± ωm. Just to keep the leading term of k = 0 for
J1(βm), the modulator output of (1) is proportional to

with two equal tones at both ωc ± ωm. In practical system, as
discussed later, the inclusion of higher-order terms does not
change the principle of the measurement. The higher-order
terms also does not contribute to the system crosstalk if the
MZM is biased exactly at the minimum transmission point.

With the two-tone input of (3) and with the narrow-band
assumption of |H(ωc − ωm)| ≫ |H(ωc + ωm)| , the output of
the optical ﬁlter is equal to

In the derivation of (7) from (1) to (6), many constant factors
are ignored by replacing proportional by equality relation-
ship. Because those factors are independent of frequency, the
inclusion or exclusion of those factors does not change the
measured response of (7) but just moves the whole curve up
and down.
Without

the optical ﬁlter, followed the derivation from
(1) to (7), the network analyzer gives a complex response
proportional to J1 (βm) Dme−jϕm. The measurement with the
same setup but without the optical ﬁlter gives the calibration
factors. Excluding the calibration factors from the measured
response of (7) gives the optical ﬁlter response of

In practical measurement, the path length of the interfer-
ometric structure of Fig. 1 changes slightly with time due
to temperature and other environmental variations. The phase
response changes slowly even within the same frequency
scanning. With the random phase due to temperature and en-
vironmental variations, the frequency response of (7) becomes

J1 (βm) DmH(ωc − ωm)e

−jϕm+jΘ(t),

(9)

where the Θ(t) is the random phase contributed from the
phase variation of two paths. As the default setting for typical
network analyzer, if the complex number of (9) is averaged
over time, the averaged complex response is equal to zero.
Because the environmental phase of Θ(t) changes slowly
with time and is zero mean, as shown numerically later, the
average of many responses of (9) separately in both amplitude
and phase take out the random phase of Θ(t). Unfortunately,
separated amplitude and phase averaging is not a function
provided by typical network analyzer. In phase averaging, the
whole phase curve may move up and down but the proﬁle or
shape of the curve does not change with time.

III. MEASUREMENT RESULTS

The practical measurement needs to take into account the
optical power budget, signal-to-noise ratio of the microwave
signal, length matching of the upper and lower paths, signal-
to-crosstalk ratio, and measurement calibration. The measure-
ment setup here follows the schematic diagram of Fig. 1. With
a ﬁxed wavelength of 1554 nm, Agilent 81640A tunable laser
is used as a ﬁxed wavelength laser for its low linewidth and
high power of 6 dBm. The signal is splitted and combined by
two 3-dB couplers.

The signal output at a 50-GHz network analyzer (Agilent
E8364B) is 0 dBm and boosted up to 17 dBm (Am ≈ 2.24 V)
by a broadband ampliﬁer (SHF-824) to drive a 40-GHz zero-
chirp MZM (Avanex SD-40) with Vπ = 5.5 V. The modulation
index of βm is about 0.7. In terms of power, the third-order
tone of J3(βm) is about -33 dB of the ﬁrst-order tone. The
MZM output is ampliﬁed by an Erbium-doped ﬁber ampliﬁer
(EDFA) with small-signal gain of 20 dB at 1554 nm and
saturation output power of 22 dBm. The narrow-band optical
ﬁlter is the monochromator of Agilent 86146B with full-wave-
half-maximum (FWHM) bandwidth of 0.04 nm (5 GHz) and
insertion loss about 10 dB [5], [8], [14]. Because of the loss of
both MZM and the monochromator, the lower path of Fig. 1
with the narrow-band optical ﬁlter typically has a power about
10 dB less than the upper path at the combiner.

Both the upper and lower paths have a length of about 48 ±
0.5 m to maintain a clean phase response for the measurement.
A polarization controller is used in the upper path to align
the polarization of the two paths. To improve the network
analyzer sensitivity, an additional broadband ampliﬁer (SHF-
803) is used after a 50-GHz photodiode (u2t XPDV2020R).
The calibration measurement is provided when the Agilent
86146B monochromator is tuned to a bandwidth of 10 nm,
equivalently without an optical ﬁlter.

calibration purpose. The center frequency of the ﬁlter for
calibration is 0.145 nm (18.6 GHz) from the carrier frequency.
The calibration traces shows the composite frequency response
of the broadband ampliﬁers, MZM, and photodetector, where
the ﬁlter response is ﬂat within the 30-GHz band for a 10-
nm bandwidth optical ﬁlter, corresponding to a frequency
bandwidth of about 1250 GHz. The calibration trace is av-
eraged over 64 measured traces to take out the environmental
variations. The four circles of Fig. 3 shows the beginning and
end of the 30-GHz band that is used to characterize the narrow-
band optical ﬁlter.

Figure 4 shows the measured amplitude and phase frequency
responses of the narrow-band optical ﬁlter after calibration.
Figure 4 also shows the amplitude response measured in both
[5], [6]. The center wavelength of the optical ﬁlter is 0.145
nm (18.6 GHz) from the carrier frequency, the same as that
for Figure 3. Figure 4 is shifted by 18.6 GHz to center the
optical ﬁlter to zero frequency. In order to avoid low signal-
to-crosstalk band, the Fig. 4 shows the combination of the
ﬁlter measurement located at either side tone (ωc ± ωm) with
high signal-to-crosstalk part. The original data are measured
by network analyzer from 1 to 40 GHz with frequency
step of 25 MHz and a resolution bandwidth of 1 kHz. The
network analyzer measured response in Fig. 4 is averaged
over 64 measured data. Better resolution is available from
the network analyzer but requires longer measurement time.
The measurement of Fig. 4 shows that the phase frequency
of the optical ﬁlter is very ﬂat or more precisely ±12◦ phase
change in the important region of ±7.5 GHz, conﬁrming the
assumption of [5], [6] that the monochromator does not have
dispersion.

IV. DISCUSSION

The complex response of (7) includes the response of
H(ωc − ωm) from the narrow-band optical ﬁlter. The mea-
surement setup of Fig. 1 uses an MZM to generate two optical
tones at ωc ± ωm, respectively. Without loss of generality,
the narrow-band optical ﬁlter just selects one of the tones

at ωc − ωm. Both the amplitude and phase responses of the
optical ﬁlter are also embedded in the output signal at the
frequency of ωc −ωm. When this signal beats with the original
carrier signal at ωc, the ﬁlter response of H(ωc − ωm) is
measured by the microwave network analyzer. The correct
operation of the setup of Fig. 1 requires the condition that
|H(ωc − ωm)| ≫ |H(ωc + ωm)|. This condition can translate
to the requirement that the operating range of the setup of Fig.
1 is about four to ﬁve times larger than the bandwidth of the
optical ﬁlter.

The measurement setup can measure an optical ﬁlter with
wider bandwidth if the center frequency of ωc is tuned such
that only the large modulated frequency of ωm is used.
Like Fig. 4, the frequency response is combined from the
measurements when ωc is tuned to either smaller or larger than
the center of the optical ﬁlter. With this modiﬁed measurement
procedure, the bandwidth of the optical ﬁlter can be in the
range of about 10 to 15 GHz. Used for demonstration purpose,
this special technique is not required for the measurement of
the ﬁlter of Fig. 4.

The optical ﬁlter with a bandwidth of 0.04 and 10 nm has a
loss difference of about 2 dB. The difference in the ﬁlter loss
does not change the ﬁlter proﬁle. When the calibration trace
is obtained by tuning the bandwidth of the monochromator
to 10 nm, the measured amplitude and phase responses are
contaminated by a larger amount EDFA noise. The effect of
EDFA noise is reduced by averaging over many measured
traces. The calibration trace of Fig. 3 is obtained by averaging
of 64 traces.

¿From the measurements in Fig. 4, the amplitude response
measured by network analyzer is matched very well to that
measured in [5]. In the measurement for [5], a single-
wavelength laser source inputs to the monochromator fol-
lowed by an optical power meter. The monochromator is
tuned to slightly different wavelength to obtain the amplitude
response proﬁle. The amplitude response is derived from the
output power as a function of the center wavelength of the
monochromator. The variation of the phase response of Fig. 4

JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY

is also very small as explained by the physics of the double-
pass monochromator in [8]. The non-symmetric magnitude
response is caused by manufacturing error of the device and
agrees with the measurement in [19].

In the measurement setup of Fig. 1,

the bias point of
the MZM is chosen by minimizing the power at the carrier
frequency at the MZM spectrum output. The MZM should
be minimum bias by this tuning method. Ideally, there is no
carrier tone at the frequency of ωc. In the measurement of
Fig. 2(b), the tone at ωc is about 21.5 dB smaller than the two
tones at both ωc ± ωm due to the limited extinction ratio of the
MZM. As from Fig. 2(c), the tone at the carrier frequency of
ωc can be ignored as the response of H(ωc) is far smaller than
the response at H(ωc − ωm). At the input of the combiner, the
upper path of Fig. 1 gives an optical signal 10 dB larger than
that of the lower path. In additional to the difference in H(ωc)
and H(ωc −ωm), the crosstalk is at most 30 dB lower than the
signal power. As from (2), the higher-order term does not give
crosstalk to the signal. The only crosstalk is from the non-zero
carrier at ωc and the insufﬁcient difference in H(ωc ± ωm).
Even in the worst case, the crosstalk is 40 to 50 dB lower than
the signal.

The minimum bias operation of an MZM has larger inser-
tion loss than that of maximum bias. Without driving signal
from network analyzer, the minimum- and maximum-biased
MZM has about 40 dB and 4 dB insertion loss, respectively.
The extinction ratio of the MZM is about 36 dB from this
measurement. Although the maximum-biased MZM provides
low insertion loss, the output signal has a large carrier tone
that is not suitable for this measurement propose. With driving
signal, the minimum-biased MZM has about 30 dB insertion
loss by comparing input power with averaged output power.
The power budget is critical to the setup with MZM that
operates at minimum bias point.

The network analyzer provides dynamic range of up to 110
dB and noise ﬂoor is down to about -90 dBm over 1 to 40
GHz band with resolution bandwidth of 1 kHz. While the
narrow-band ﬁlter is centered at 18.6 GHz from carrier, the
maximum power of the amplitude is about -17 dBm and the
range of magnitude response is bounded within 75 dB over 1-
to 40-GHz band.

In the measurement setup,

the length of lower path is
measured by its equivalent length of a single mode ﬁber. The
delay of the lower path is about 236 ns with equivalent length
of 47.7 m, where delay of a 10 m single mode patch cord is
measured to be 49.4 ns. The upper path has a 45 m patch cord
together with a 3 m polarization controller.

The phase response of the measurement hurts by environ-
mental instability. When path difference between upper and
lower path is reduced down to 0.5 m, temperature variation of
two paths still give phase variation. The longest delay is due to
EDFA with about 38 m for the lower path and compensates by
the patch core for upper path. The temperature induced length
variation converts to phase variation that cannot be averaged
out by the network analyzer itself. By unwrapping the phase
response measured by the network analyzer, the amplitude and
phase responses can be averaged separately.

over 1- to 40-GHz band. Requiring additional delay for each
resolution points, we choose stepped sweep mode for the net-
work analyzer to reduce the measurement error due to the long
path delay of the setup. The measurement acquisition time is
about 2 second/trace and about 1000 traces are collected for
detail data analysis. The measured and calibration traces are
averaged over 64 traces to mitigate the ampliﬁer noise from
EDFA and environmental variations. With 64 trace moving
averaging, the measurements are very stable with time.

Figure 4 is averaged over 64 traces. The phase of Fig. 4
at zero frequency is determined by the ﬁrst trace. The phase
of other 63 traces at zero frequency is moved to the speciﬁc
value after the phase unwrapping. Consider the 64-moving
averaging of 1000 traces and within ±7.5 GHz of Fig. 4,
there is less than ±3◦ of peak phase variations. For low signal
power region, the 64-averaged traces has phase variation of
±10◦ of right- and left-most edge of the measured phase
response due to additional thermal noise. The thermal effect
becomes signiﬁcant for the network analyzer when received
signal power is down to -70 dBm or less, where the signal
power at two edges in Fig. 4 are about -85 dBm. For smaller
average window size of 16 and 32 sliding over 1000 measured
traces, the peak phase variations are within ±10◦ and ±6◦
in ±7.5 GHz measurement band, respectively. The amplitude
responses after average of 16, 32, and 64 traces are very stable
with indistinguishable variation in important region of ±7.5
GHz. The 64-averaged result shows its good stability over
1000 traces or equivalently 50 mins measurement time.

For commercial instrument (for example, Agilent 86038B)
using traditional modulation phase-shift method, the frequency
and wavelength step size (or resolution) is down to 12.5 MHz
(0.1 pm) in accordance with the ﬁnest step of the tunable laser.
The resolution bandwidth for dispersion of the equipment is
determined by the modulation frequency. The typical absolute
and relative wavelength accuracy are ±3.6 pm (450 MHz)
and ±2 pm (250 MHz). The better wavelength accuracy using
smaller modulation frequency gives lower phase accuracy. The
accuracy for phase-shift method is insufﬁcient for narrow-
band device. As an example, the Agilent 86038B has the
smallest modulation frequency of 5 MHz with a phase (or

dispersion) accuracy 400 times worse than the largest mod-
ulation frequency of 2 GHz. Assume a dispersion coefﬁcient
of D = 17 ps/km/nm and a measurement range of ±1 GHz,
the phase-shift method must measure a phase change within
±0.00025◦ for modulation frequency of 5 MHz but a phase
change within ±0.1◦ for modulation frequency of 2 GHz.
Even for the modulation frequency of 2 GHz and using an
intermediate frequency bandwidth of 70 Hz, a phase change
within ±0.1◦ is not simple.

The frequency accuracy of the network analyzer is about
1 ppm or less than 50 kHz for a frequency up to 50 GHz.
The resolution bandwidth for network analyzer can be down
to the order of 1 to 10 Hz. With a step size of 25 MHz,
the measurement for Fig. 4 uses a resolution bandwidth of
1 kHz. Although the step size for tunable laser in phase-
shift method is comparable to that in network analyzer, the
accuracy or resolution bandwidth for phase-shift method is
many orders larger than that for network analyzer method
proposed here. Figure 5 shows the beating of the combined
signal of (6) as measured by a spectrum analyzer when the
modulation frequency of ωm is ﬁxed at 20 GHz with a
resolution bandwidth of 1 kHz, the same as the measurement
for Fig. 4. The signal-to-noise ratio is about 40 dB from Fig. 5
and the linewidth is approximately the same as the resolution
bandwidth of 1 kHz. With the signal-to-noise ratio of 40 dB,
the amplitude error is less than 0.1 dB and the phase error
is less than 1◦ [20, Fig. 8]. Both the amplitude and phase
accuracy of network analyzer is better than the modulation
phase-shift method.

V. CONCLUSION

The amplitude and phase responses of a narrow-band optical
ﬁlter are measured accurately using a microwave network
analyzer. A minimum-biased MZM generates two tones at
ωc ± ωm and the narrow-band optical ﬁlter selects one of the
tones. Either tone of ωc ± ωm beats with the carrier frequency
of ωc and the beating signal is sent to a network analyzer for
the simultaneous measurement of amplitude and phase.

The higher-order terms of the MZM output do not de-
grade the measurement. With ensemble averaging over 64
measured traces, the measurement removes temperature and
environmental variations induced phase variations and EDFA
noises. Although the measurement range of the setup is limited
by bandwidths of the network analyzer and the associated
microwave and electro-optical components, a ﬁne frequency
resolution is provided by the network analyzer. The measure-
ment setup here has a step-size or frequency resolution of
25 MHz and resolution bandwidth of 1 kHz. The frequency
accuracy is determined mainly by the resolution bandwidth of
the microwave network analyzer.

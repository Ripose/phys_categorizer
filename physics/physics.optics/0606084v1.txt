Abstract

We investigate the eﬀects of delayed Raman response on pulse dynamics in massive multichannel

optical ﬁber communication systems. Taking into account the stochastic nature of pulse sequences

in diﬀerent frequency channels and the Raman induced energy exchange in pulse collisions we show

that the pulse parameters exhibit intermittent dynamic behavior, and that the pulse amplitudes

exhibit relatively strong and long-range correlations. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the Raman-induced

cross frequency shift is the main intermittency-related mechanism leading to bit pattern deterio-

ration and evaluate the bit-error-rate of the system.

The dynamic evolution of coherent patterns in the presence of noise and nonlinearities

is a rich and complex subject that is of major importance in many areas of physics. Fiber

optics communication systems, which employ optical pulses to represent bits of information,

serve as an excellent example for systems where noise and nonlinear eﬀects can have an

important role in the dynamics of coherent patterns [1]. It is known that the dynamics of

the parameters characterizing the pulses in optical ﬁber transmission systems can exhibit

non-Gaussian statistics [2, 3, 4, 5]. Yet, it is commonly believed that the statistics of the

optical pulse parameters is very diﬀerent from the intermittent statistics encountered in

strong nonlinear phenomena such as turbulence and chaotic ﬂow. (For a review of inter-

mittency in the context of turbulent ﬂow, see Ref.

[6]). In this Letter we present results

that contrast this common belief and show that the parameters of optical pulses can exhibit

intermittent dynamic behavior in massive multichannel transmission systems. Furthermore,

we demonstrate that this intermittent dynamics can have important practical consequences

by leading to relatively large values of the bit-error-rate (BER) characterizing the system

performance.

We consider conventional optical solitons as an example for the pulses carrying the infor-

mation and focus attention on the eﬀects of delayed Raman response on the propagation.

The main eﬀect of delayed Raman response on single-soliton propagation is the self fre-

quency shift, which is due to energy transfer from higher frequency components of the pulse

to its lower frequency components [7, 8]. The main eﬀect of a single two-soliton collision in

the presence of delayed Raman response is an energy exchange between the colliding pulses

(Raman induced cross talk), which leads to a change in their amplitudes [9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

In addition, the frequencies of the two solitons also change as a result of the collision (Raman

induced cross frequency shift) [9, 11, 12, 13].

The combined eﬀect of Raman scattering and randomness of soliton sequences in multi-

channel transmission systems was considered in Refs. [14, 15], where it was found that the

soliton amplitude has a lognormal distribution. It was also shown that the distribution of

the cross frequency shift in a two-channel system is lognormal and that the ﬁrst two normal-

ized moments of the self frequency shift grow exponentially with increasing distance. Even

though these studies implied intermittent dynamic behavior for the soliton amplitude, it was

not clear whether the other soliton parameters exhibit similar dynamic behavior in a general

multichannel system. Moreover, the eﬀect of the amplitude intermittent behavior on the

2

main measure of system performance, the BER, was not addressed at all. In this Letter we

study in detail the intermittent character of soliton dynamics. We show that the normalized

nth moments of the self and cross frequency shifts are exponentially increasing with both

propagation distance z and n2, i.e., the self and cross frequency shifts exhibit intermittent

dynamic behavior. We ﬁnd that the nth order equal-z amplitude correlation functions have

similar dependence on z and n2 with a typical correlation time which is much larger than

the time slot width, thus showing that the system exhibits relatively strong and long-range

correlations. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the cross-frequency shift is the main intermittency-

related mechanism leading to an increase of the BER, and calculate the z-dependence of the

BER for diﬀerent channels.

Propagation of pulses of light through an optical ﬁber in the presence of delayed Raman

response is described by the following perturbed nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation [1]:

parameters of the reference channel soliton, for example, one ﬁnds that the most important

eﬀect of the collision is an O(ǫR) change in the soliton amplitude [10, 12]:

∆η0 = 2η0ηβsgn(β)ǫR.

(2)

The main eﬀect of the collision in order ǫR/β is a frequency shift given by [12]: ∆β0 =

(8η2

). Since ǫR ≪

R and higher.

We now describe propagation of a soliton in the reference channel undergoing many

collisions with solitons from all other frequency channels in a system with 2N + 1 channels.

We assume that the amplitudes of the latter solitons are all equal to 1. The stochastic

3

character of soliton sequences in diﬀerent channels is taken into account by deﬁning discrete

random variables ζij, which describe the occupation state of the jth time slot in the ith

channel: ζij = 1 if the slot is occupied and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the nth moment of ζij

satisﬁes

= s, where s is the average fraction of occupied time slots, assumed to be the

same in all channels. We also assume that the occupation states of diﬀerent time slots are

uncorrelated:

= s2 if i

between neighboring channels and by T the time slot width. We assume that the change in
η0 over the interval ∆z(1)

c = T /(2∆β), traveled by the reference channel soliton while passing

two successive time slots in the nearby channels, is small. Using Eq. (2) and summing over
all collisions occurring at ∆z(1)

correspond to the 101-channel system operating at 10 Gbits/s per channel discussed in

detail below. One can see that the fourth moment increases much faster with increasing

z compared with the second and third moments. These results are of special importance

since other contributions to changes in the soliton parameters are also coupled to the soliton
amplitude via integrals over z and thus follow the same statistics as β(s)

To gain further insight into the intermittent dynamic behavior exhibited by the solitons

we calculate the nth order equal-distance amplitude correlation functions, which measure

correlation between amplitudes of solitons from diﬀerent time slots in the same channel.

respectively. We still assume that the amplitudes of solitons in other channels are 1. There-

fore, considering collisions with solitons from the ith channel, for example, the diﬀerence

between the dynamics of the two solitons is due to the fact that the 0j soliton experiences

the disorder experienced by the 00 soliton with a delay given by ∆zji = jT /(2βi). Using
this fact and the decomposition of ξ(0) into the ξ(0)

From the practical point of view it is important to understand the inﬂuence of the inter-

mittent dynamic behavior of the soliton parameters on the BER. The contribution of the

collision-induced pulse decay to the BER was discussed in detail in previous works (see Ref.

[17] and references therein). Moreover, the small-η tail of the lognormal distribution lies

below the corresponding tail of the Gaussian distribution, whereas the large-η lognormal

tail lies above the corresponding Gaussian tail. As a result, strong eﬀects due to deviations

from Gaussian statistics are related to relatively large η-values. When the position dynam-

ics or the frequency dynamics are coupled to the amplitude dynamics such large η-values

can lead to signiﬁcant increase in the BER due to walk-oﬀ of the soliton from its assigned

in channels i = 0 (the reference channel), i = 25, and i = 50 (the outermost channel) for

the aforementioned system. One can see that the BER in the reference channel increases

function G(η0, ∆y(cd)

the BER. It can be seen that this distribution is very diﬀerent from the one observed for

single-channel soliton propagation in the presence of ampliﬁer noise (see Fig. 1 in Ref. [3]).

While the latter distribution is approximately symmetric about ∆y0 = 0 and η0 = 1, the
former is strongly asymmetric with an extended tail in the large-η0 and large-negative-∆y(cd)
region. The strong asymmetric form of G(η0, ∆y(cd)

) in our case is due to the strong coupling

between the position dynamics and the amplitude dynamics and the lognormal statistics of

the soliton amplitude. Thus, we ﬁnd that amplitude dynamics plays a dominant role in error

generation in massive multichannel optical ﬁber transmission systems, a situation which is

very diﬀerent from the one observed in single-channel transmission systems [3].

In summary, we studied soliton propagation in massive multichannel optical ﬁber commu-

nication systems taking into account the eﬀects of delayed Raman response and the random

character of pulse sequences. We found that the soliton parameters exhibit intermittent

dynamic behavior and showed that the cross frequency shift is the main mechanism leading

to bit pattern deterioration and to relatively large values of the bit-error-rate. We empha-

size that similar dynamic behavior is expected in massive dispersion-managed multichannel

transmission systems as well. In such systems the Raman-induced energy exchange in col-

lisions will lead to lognormal statistics for the pulse amplitudes. In addition, the frequency

11

and position dynamics will be aﬀected by a variety of amplitude-dependent perturbations

due to Kerr nonlinearity. The coupling of the frequency and position dynamics to the am-

plitude dynamics will lead to intermittent dynamics of the pulse frequency and position and

to relatively large values of the bit-error-rate.

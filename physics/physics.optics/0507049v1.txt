Abstract

We demonstrate that the spatial resolution of images in optical tomography is not limited to

the fundamental length scale of one transport mean free path. This result is facilitated by the

introduction of novel corrections to the standard integral equations of scattering theory within the

diﬀusion approximation to the radiative transport equation.

There has been considerable recent interest in the development of optical methods for

tomographic imaging [1]. The physical problem that is considered is to recover the optical

properties of the interior of an inhomogeneous medium from measurements taken on its

surface. The starting point for the mathematical formulation of this inverse scattering

problem (ISP) is a model for the propagation of light, typically taken to be the diﬀusion

approximation (DA) to the radiative transport equation (RTE). The DA is valid when the

energy density of the optical ﬁeld varies slowly on the scale of the transport mean free path
ℓ∗. The DA breaks down in optically thin layers, near boundary surfaces, or near the source.

One or more of these conditions are encountered in biomedical applications such as imaging

of small animals [2] or of functional activity in the brain.

Within the accuracy of the DA, reconstruction algorithms based on both numerical [3]

and analytic solutions [4, 5, 6] to the ISP have been described. Regardless of the method

of inversion, the spatial resolution of reconstructed images is expected to be limited to
ℓ∗. This expectation is due to the intertwined eﬀects of the ill-posedness of the ISP [5]

and intrinsic inaccuracies of the DA [7]. In this Letter, we introduce novel corrections to

the integral equations of scattering theory within the DA. Using this result, we report the
reconstruction of superresolved images whose spatial resolution is less than ℓ∗.

We begin by considering the propagation of multiply-scattered light in an inhomogenous

medium characterized by an absorption coeﬃcient µa(r). In what follows, we will neglect the

contribution of ballistic photons and consider only diﬀuse photons whose speciﬁc intensity

I(r, ˆs) at the point r in the direction ˆs is taken to obey the time-independent RTE

ˆs · ∇I(r, ˆs) + (µa + µs)I(r, ˆs) − µs

d2s′A(ˆs, ˆs′)I(r, ˆs′) = S(r, ˆs) ,

(1)

Z
where µs is the scattering coeﬃcient, A(ˆs, ˆs′) is the scattering kernel, and S(r, ˆs) is the
source. The change in speciﬁc intensity due to spatial ﬂuctuations in µa(r) can be obtained

from the integral equation

φ(r1, ˆs1; r2, ˆs2) =

d3rd2sG(r1, ˆs1; r, ˆs)G(r, ˆs; r2, ˆs2)δµa(r) .

Here the data function φ(r1, ˆs1; r2, ˆs2) is proportional, to lowest order in δµa, to the change
in speciﬁc intensity relative to a reference medium with absorption µ0

We now show that the integral equation (2) may be used to obtain corrections to the

usual formulation of scattering theory within the DA. To proceed, we note that, following
Ref. [6], the Green’s function G(r, ˆs; r′, ˆs′) may be expanded in angular harmonics of ˆs and
ˆs′:

G(r, ˆs; r′, ˆs′) =

δ(r − r′), where the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D0 = 1/3cℓ∗ and α0 = cµ0

a. In addition, the Green’s

function must satisfy boundary conditions on the surface of the medium (or at inﬁnity in

the case of free boundaries). In general we will consider boundary conditions of the form
G(r, r′) + ℓˆn · ∇G(r, r′) = 0, where ˆn is the outward unit normal to the surface bounding the

medium and ℓ is the extrapolation distance. Making use of (3) and performing the angular

integration over ˆs in (2) we obtain

Eq. (5) is the main theoretical result of this Letter. It may be viewed as providing corrections

to the DA since the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (5) corresponds to the standard DA

in an inhomogeneous absorbing medium. We note that the second term may be interpreted
as deﬁning an eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(r) = D0 − (ℓ∗2

/3)δα(r) since the expression

∇rG(r1, r) · ∇rG(r, r2) deﬁnes the diﬀusion kernel in a medium with an inhomogeneous

diﬀusion coeﬃcient [3].

For the remainder of this paper we will work in the planar measurement geometry, often

encountered in small-animal imaging. In this case, (4) becomes

where ρ1 denotes the transverse coordinates of a point source in the plane z = 0, ρ2 denotes

the transverse coordinates of a point detector in the plane z = L, and the dependence of φ

on ˆs1 and ˆs2 is not made explicit. Evidently, from considerations of invariance of the kernel

K(ρ1, ρ2; r) under translations of its transverse arguments, it can be seen that K may be

expressed as the Fourier integral

Inversion of the integral equation (6) may be carried out by analytic methods. These

methods have been shown to be computationally eﬃcient and may be applied to data sets

consisting of a very large number of measurements [5, 6]. The approach taken is to construct

the singular value decomposition of the linear operator K in the proper Hilbert space setting

and then use this result to obtain the pseudoinverse solution to (6). In this manner, it is

possible to account for the eﬀects of sampling and thereby obtain the best (in the sense of
minimizing the appropriate L2 norm) bandlimited approximation to δα. Here we use this

approach to simulate the reconstruction of a point absorber located at a point r0 between

the measurement planes with δα(r) = Aδ(r − r0) for constant A.

In this situation it is

possible to calculate the data function φ within radiative transport theory, thus avoiding
“inverse crime.” To proceed, we require the Green’s function G(r, ˆs; r′, ˆs′) for the RTE in

a homogeneous inﬁnite medium which we obtain as described in Ref. [8]. Note that in this

case, the angular integration over ˆs in (2) may be carried out analytically.

The eﬀects of corrections to the DA were studied in numerical simulations following the

methods of Ref. [5]. The simulations were performed for a medium with optical properties

similar to breast tissue in the near infrared [9]. The background absorption and reduced
s = 10 cm−1. The scattering
scattering coeﬃcients were given by µ0

g = 0.98. This choice of parameters corresponds to ℓ∗ = 1 mm and D0 = 0.8 cm2ns−1. The

separation between the measurement planes L was varied in order to explore the eﬀects of

the corrections. A single point absorber was placed at the midpoint of the measurement
planes with r0 = (0, 0, L/2) and A = 1 cm3 ns−1. The sources and detectors were located

on a square lattice with spacing h. The total number of source-detector pairs N was varied,

along with h, as indicated below. To demonstrate the stability of the reconstruction in the

presence of noise, Gaussian noise of zero mean was added to the data at the 1% level, relative

to the average signal. Note that the level of regularization was chosen to be the same for all

reconstructions.

Reconstruction of δα(r) for a point absorber deﬁnes the point spread function (PSF) of the

reconstruction algorithm. The resolution ∆x is deﬁned as the half width at half maximum

of the PSF. In Fig. 1(a) we consider the case of a thick layer with L = 6.6 cm. The above
parameters were chosen to be h = 0.83 mm and N = 1.5 × 109. PSFs with and without

corrections are shown. It may be seen that the eﬀect of the corrections is negligible in the
case of a thick layer and the resolution ∆x = 3.5ℓ∗. For the case of a layer of intermediate

thickness with L = 1.1 cm, as shown in Fig. 1(b), the corrections have a more signiﬁcant
eﬀect. In particular, with h = 0.28 mm and N = 1.2 × 1011, we found that ∆x = 0.9ℓ∗
for the uncorrected reconstruction and ∆x = 0.7ℓ∗ for the corrected reconstruction. The

corrections are most signiﬁcant for the thinnest layer considered in this study, achieving a

factor of two improvement in resolution when L = 0.55 cm. In this case, with h = 0.14 mm
and N = 1.9 × 1012, we found that ∆x = 0.4ℓ∗ for the uncorrected case and ∆x = 0.2ℓ∗

for the corrected case as shown in Fig. 1(c). Note that the number of source-detector pairs
N ≈ 109 − 1012 may be achieved in modern non-contact optical tomography systems [10].

In conclusion, we have described a series of corrections to the usual formulation of the

DA in optical tomography. We have found that these corrections give rise to superresolved
images with resolution below ℓ∗. Several comments on these results are necessary. First,

the eﬀects of corrections were demonstrated to be most signiﬁcant in optically thin layers.

However, corrections to the DA may also be expected to be important for thick layers when

inhomogeneities in the absorption are located near the surface. Second, the results of this

study were obtained without resorting to so-called inverse crime. That is, forward scattering

data was obtained from the full RTE under conditions when the DA is known to break down.

Third, the use of analytic reconstruction algorithms was essential for handling the extremely

5

large data employed in this study. Finally, we note that higher order corrections to the DA

are also expected to be important for the nonlinear ISP.

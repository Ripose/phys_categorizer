Abstract— Using quasiclassical approach rather precise analyt-
ical approximations for the eigenfrequencies of whispering gallery
modes in convex axisymmetric bodies may be found. We use the
eikonal method to analyze the limits of precision of quasiclassical
approximation using as a practical example spheroidal dielectric
cavity. The series obtained for the calculation of eigenfrequencies
is compared with the known series for dielectric sphere and with
numerical calculations. We show how geometrical interpretation
allows expansion of the method on arbitrary shaped axisymmetric
bodies.

I. INTRODUCTION

Submillimeter size optical microspheres made of fused
silica with whispering gallery modes (WGM)[1] can have
extremely high quality-factor, up to 1010 that makes them
promising devices for applications in optoelectronics and
experimental physics. Historically Richtmyer[2] was the ﬁrst
to suggest that whispering gallery modes in axisymmetric
dielectric body should have very high quality-factor. He ex-
amined the cases of sphere and torus. However only recent
breakthroughs in technology in several labs allowed producing
not only spherical and not only fused silica but spheroidal,
toroidal [3], [4] or even arbitrary form axisymmetrical optical
microcavities from crystalline materials preserving or even
increasing high quality factor [5]. Especially interesting are
devices manufactured of nonlinear optical crystals. Microres-
onators of this type can be used as high-ﬁnesse cavities
for laser stabilization, as frequency discriminators and high-
sensitive displacement sensors, as sensors of ambient medium
and in optoelectronical RF high-stable oscillators. (See for
example materials of the special LEOS workshop on WGM
microresonators [6]).

The theory of WGMs in microspheres is well established
and allows precise calculation of eigenmodes, radiative losses
and ﬁeld distribution both analytically and numerically. Unfor-
tunately, the situation changes drastically even in the case of
simplest axisymmetric geometry, different from ideal sphere
or cylinder. No closed analytical solution can be found in this
case. Direct numerical methods like ﬁnite elements method are
also inefﬁcient when the size of a cavity is several orders larger
than the wavelength. The theory of quasiclassical methods
of eigenfrequencies approximation starting from pioneering
paper [7] have made a great progress lately [8]. For the
practical evaluation of precision that these methods can in
principal provide, we chose a practical problem of calculation
of eigenfrequencies in dielectric spheroid and found a series
over angular mode number l. This choice of geometry is
convenient due to several reasons: 1) other shapes, for example
toroids [4] may be approximated by equivalent spheroids; 2)
the eikonal equation as well as scalar Helmholtz equation (but

M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia

not the vector one!) is separable in spheroidal coordinates
that gives additional ﬂexibility in understanding quasiclassical
methods and comparing them with other approximations; 3)
in the limit of zero eccentricity spheroid turns to sphere for
which exact solution and series over l up to l−8/3 is known
[9].

The Helmholtz vector equation is unseparable [10] in
spheroidal coordinates and no vector harmonics tangential
to the surface of spheroid can be build. That is why there
are no pure TE or TM modes in spheroids but only hybrid
ones. Different methods of separation of variables (SVM)
using series expansions with either spheroidal or spherical
functions have been proposed [11], [12], [13]. Unfortunately
they lead to extremely bulky inﬁnite sets of equations which
can be solved numerically only in simplest cases and the
convergence is not proved. Exact characteristic equation for
the eigenfrequencies in dielectric spheroid was suggested[14]
without provement that if real could signiﬁcantly ease the task
of ﬁnding eigenfrequencies. However, we can not conﬁrm this
claim as this characteristic equation contradicts limiting cases
with the known solutions i.e. ideal sphere and axisymmetrical
oscillations in a spheroid with perfectly conducting walls [15].
Nevertheless, in case of whispering gallery modes adjacent
to equatorial plane the energy is mostly concentrated in
tangential or normal to the surface electric components that
can be treated as quasi-TE or quasi-TM modes and analyzed
with good approximation using scalar wave equations.

II. SPHEROIDAL COORDINATE SYSTEM

There are several equivalent ways to introduce prolate and
oblate spheroidal coordinates and corresponding eigenfunc-
tions [16], [17], [18]. The following widely used system of
coordinates allows to analyze prolate and oblate geometries
simultaneously:

axis of rotational symmetry of the body as b. In this case

The calculation of spheroidal functions and of λml is not
a trivial
task [19], [20]. The approximation of spheroidal
functions and their zeroes may seem more straightforward for
the calculation of eigenfrequencies of spheroids, however we
found that another approach that we develop below gives better
results and may be easily generalized to other geometries.

III. EIKONAL APPROXIMATION IN SPHEROID

The eikonal approximation is a powerful method for solving
optical problems in inhomogeneous media where the scale
of the variations is much larger than the wavelength. It was
shown by Keller and Rubinow [7] that it can also be applied to
eigenfrequency problems and that it has very clear quasiclas-
sical ray interpretation. It is important that this quasiclassical
ray interpretation requiring simple calculation of the ray paths
along the geodesic surfaces and application of phase equality
(quantum) conditions gives precisely the same equations as the
eikonal equations. Eikonal equations allow, however, to obtain
more easily not only eigenfrequencies but ﬁeld distribution
also.

The ﬁrst order approximation for the phase function S called
eikonal is determined by the following equation.

(2)

u(r) = A(r)eık0S(r).

S)2 = ǫ(r),

(
∇

where ǫ is optical susceptibility. For our problem of searching
for eigenfrequencies ǫ does not depend on coordinates, ǫ = n2
inside the cavity and ǫ = 1 – outside. Though the eikonal can
be found as complex rays in the external area and stitched on
the boundary as well as ray method of Keller and Rubinow
[7], [8], [21] can be extended for whispering gallery modes
in dielectrical bodies in a more rigorous way [22]. To do so
we must account for an additional phase shift on the dielectric
boundary. Fresnel amplitude coefﬁcient of reﬂection [23]:

However direct use of this phase shift in the equations for
internal rays as suggestes in [22] leads to incorrect results.
The reason is a well known Goos-H¨anchen effect – the shift
of the reﬂected beam along the surface. The beams behave
as if they are reﬂected from the surface hold away from the
real boundary at σr = Θr
2k cos θ . That is why we may substitute
the problem for a dielectric body with the problem for an
equivalent body enlarged on σr with the totally reﬂecting
boundaries. The parameters of equivalent spheroid are marked
below with overbars.

where α = n
µ2/ν2. It is now the time to turn to
the quasiclassical ray interpretation [7], [8]. The equation for
the eikonal describes the rays that can spread inside spheroid
along the straight line. These are the rays that freely go inside
spheroid than touch the surface and reﬂect. For the whispering
gallery modes the angle of reﬂection is close to π/2. The
closest to the center points of these rays form the caustic
surface which is the ellipsoid determined by a parameter ξr.
The rays are the tangents to this internal ellipsoid and follow
along the geodesic lines on it. In case of ideal sphere all the
rays of the same family lie in the same plane. However, even
a slightest eccentricity removes this degeneracy and inclined
closed circular modes which should be more accurately called
quasimodes [24] are turned into open-ended helices winding

up on caustic spheroid precessing [25], and ﬁlling up the whole
region as in a clew. The upper and lower points of these
trajectories determine other caustic surface with a parameter
ηr determining two-sheeted hyperbolid for prolate or one-
sheeted hyperboloid for oblate spheroid. The value of ηr has
very simple mechanical interpretation. The rays in the eikonal
approximation are equivalent to the trajectories of a point-like
billiard ball inside the cavity. As axisymmetrical surface can
not change the angular momentum related to the z axis, it
should be conserved as well as the kinetic energy (velocity).
That is why ηr is simply equal to the sine of the angle between
the equatorial plane and the trajectory crossing the equator and
at the same time it determines the maximum elongation of the
trajectory from the equator plane. If all the rays touch the
caustic or boundary surface with phases that form stationary
distribution (that means that the phase difference along any
closed curve on them is equal to integer times 2π), then the
eigenfunction and hence eigenfrequency is found.

To ﬁnd the circular integrals of phases kS (14) we should
take into account the properties of phase evolutions on caustic
and reﬂective boundary. Every touching of caustic adds π/2
(see for example [8]) and reﬂection adds π. Thus for S1 we
have one caustic shift of π/2 at ξr and one reﬂection from
the equivalent boundary surface ξs (at the distance σ from the
real surface), for S2 – two times π/2 due to caustic shifts at

ηr, and we should add nothing for S3.

= 0, 1, 2.... These conditions plus integrals
(14) completely coincide with those obtained by Bykov [26],
[27], [28] if we transform ellipsoidal to spheroidal coordinates,
and have clear geometrical interpretation. The integral for S1
corresponds to the difference in lengths of the two geodesic
curves on ηr between two points P1 = (ξr, ηr, φ1) and
P2 = (ξr, ηr, φ2). The ﬁrst one goes from the caustic circle
of intersection between ξr and ηr along ηr to the boundary
surface ξs, reﬂects from it, and returns back to the same circle.
The second is simply the arc of the circle between P1 and P2.
The integral for S2 corresponds to the length of a geodesic
line going from P1 along ξr, lowering to
ηr and returning
to ηr at P2 minus the length of the arc of the circle between
P1 and P2. The third integral is simply the length of the circle
of intersection of ξr and ηr.

To test this series we calculated using ﬁnite element method
eigenfrequencies of TE modes in spheroids with different
eccentricities with totally reﬂecting boundaries for l = m =
100 (Fig.2). Signiﬁcant improvement of our series is evident.
The divergence of the series for large eccenricities is explained
by the fact that the approximation that we used to calculate
the integrals (16) but not the method itself breaks down in this
case. Namely ηr becomes comparable to ξ and should not be
treated as a small parameter.

If we put a = b, then all six terms in the obtained series
coincide with that obtained in [9] from exact solution in

The eikonal equation for the sphere may be solved explicitly
and the expansion of the solution shows that quasiclassical
approximation breaks down on a term O(l−1), and of the same

equations by a scalar ones.

It is interesting to note that when a = 2b (oblate spheroid
with the eccentricity ε = √0.75, the eigenfrequency separation
in the ﬁrst order of approximation between modes with the
same l determined by the third term becomes equal to the
separation between modes with different l and the same l
m
(free spectral range). The difference appears only in the term
proportional to O(l−2/3). This situation is close to the case
that was experimentally observed in [3]. This new degeneracy
has simple quasigeometrical interpretation – like in case of a
sphere geodesic lines inclined to the equator plane on such
spheroid are closed curves returning at the same point of
the equator after the whole revolution, crossing, however, the
equator not twice as big circles on a sphere but four times.

IV. ARBITRARY CONVEX BODY OF REVOLUTION

To ﬁnd eigenfrequencies of whispering gallery modes in
arbitrary body of revolution one may use directly the results of
the previous section by ﬁtting the shape of the body in convex
equatorial area by equivalent spheroid. In fact the body should
be convex only in the vicinity of WG mode itself. For example
a torus with a circle of radius r0 with its center at a distance
R0 from the z axis as a generatrix may be approximated
(R0 + r0)r0.
by a spheroid with a = R0 + r0 and b =
Nevertheless, more rigorous approach may be developed.

The ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd families of caustic surfaces. This is
not a trivial task in general but it is equivalent to ﬁnding caustic
curves for the plane curve forming the body of revolution
which is in fact the so-called biinvolute curve (the difference
in length between a sum of two tangent lines from a point on
a curve to a biinvolute curve and an arc between these lines
is constant). Unfortunately we can not give now the formal
provement of this statement but it looks true. Another family
form curves orthogonal to the ﬁrst family. For example in case
of torus these families are concentric circles and radii, that is
why caustic surfaces for a torus are also concentric toruses.
In general case the following approximation may be used to
ﬁnd the ﬁrst family of biinvolute curves [8]:

p

n(s)

κρ1/3(s) + O(κ2),

≃

(20)

where n(s) is the normal distance from a point s on the curve
to a biinvolute curve, κ is a parameter of a family, and ρ is
the radius of curvature of the initial curve at s.

Let we have found a caustic surface from the ﬁrst family,

parametrized as

z = u

x = g(u) cos φ
y = g(u) sin φ

A geodesic line for this surface is given by the following

integral:

dφ

where c1 is some constant, which is equal in our case to ρr =

g(zmax) - the radius of caustic circle at maximum distance
from equatorial plane. The length of geodesic line:

In analogous way for another geodesic line on a caustic

surface from the other family:

z = v

x = h(v) cos φ
y = h(v) sin φ,

we have

For a torus caustic surfaces are toruses and cones and are

In conclusion. We have analyzed quasiclassical method

of calculation of eigenfrequencies in spheroidal cavities and
found that it gives approximations correct up to the term
proportional to l−2/3. This method may be easily expanded
on arbitrary convex bodies of revolution.

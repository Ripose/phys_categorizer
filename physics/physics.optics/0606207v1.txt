Abstract

We experimentally and theoretically study electromagnetic properties of optically thin silicon

carbide (SiC) membranes perforated by an array of sub-wavelength holes. Giant absorption and

transmission is found using Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) microscopy and explained by

introducing a frequency-dependent eﬀective permittivity ǫeﬀ(ω) of the perforated ﬁlm. The value

of ǫeﬀ(ω) is determined by the excitation of two distinct types of hole resonances: a delocalized

slow surface polariton (SSP) whose frequency is largely determined by the array period, and a

localized surface polariton (LSP) which corresponds to the resonances of an isolated hole. Only

SSPs are shown to modify ǫeﬀ (ω) strongly enough to cause giant transmission and absorption.

Diﬀraction of light is the major obstacle to increasing the density of optical circuits and

integrating them with electronics [1]: light cannot be conﬁned to dimensions much smaller

than half of its wavelength λ/2. Utilizing materials with a negative dielectric permittivity

circumvents diﬀraction limit because interfaces between polaritonic (ǫ < 0) and dielectric

(ǫ > 0) materials support quasi-electrostatic waves (surface polaritons) that can be conﬁned

to sub-λ dimensions. Negative ǫ can be due to either collective oscillation of conduction

electron in metals (plasmons) [2] or lattice vibrations in polar crystals such as ZnSe, SiC,

InP [3]. Both metallic and SiC interfaces have been shown to guide surface plasmon (and

phonon) polaritons over long distances [4, 5, 6], support negative-index waves [7, 8, 9], and

serve as elements of a super-lens [10, 11, 12]. Therefore, the explosion of research aims at

understanding basic polaritonic components: grooves in metal ﬁlms [13], nanoparticle-ﬁlm

polaritons [14], hole arrays [15], and single holes [16].

Sub-λ hole arrays were the ﬁrst to attract signiﬁcant attention after the discovery of

extraordinary optical transmission [15] through perforated optically thick metallic ﬁlms and

the ensuing controversy [17, 18] about the role of surface polaritons in transmission enhance-

ment. The diﬃculty with interpreting the role of surface polaritons (SPs) in transmission
through optically thick (λskin ≡

laritons) can spoof surface polaritons [19], especially when λ is close to array period L. No

such spooﬁng occurs for optically thin ﬁlms.

In this Letter we report results of the spectroscopic study of such suspended perforated

SiC membranes, with both hole diameter D

λ and period L < λ signiﬁcantly sub-λ. SiC is

≪
chosen because of its low losses [3] and the possibility of growing high quality thin SiC ﬁlms on

Si substrates [20]. While the majority of surface phonon polariton experiments to-date have

been conducted with SiC substrates [3, 6, 21], thin SiC membranes hold a greater promise

for fabricating novel multi-layer nanophononic structures [12]. Using FTIR microscopy, we

demonstrate that, in adjacent frequency ranges, giant transmission and absorption of the

incident radiation is realized. Both phenomena are shown to be due to the excitation of quasi-

electrostatic SPs. It is shown that a perforated ﬁlm can be described as a metamaterial with

the eﬀective permittivity ǫeﬀ = ǫr + iǫi strongly modiﬁed by the excitation of SPs: regions

of giant transmission and absorption are related, respectively, to the lowering of

and

increase of ǫi. In addition, we show theoretically that two types of SPs are supported by the

2

hole arrays in a polaritonic membrane: localized surface polaritons (LSPs) and delocalized

SSPs.

Square arrays of round holes were milled by a dual focused ion beam (FIB) system (FEI

Strata 235) in a suspended SiC membrane. The starting material for membrane fabrication

was a 458 nm thick single-crystalline 3C-SiC ﬁlm heteroepitaxially grown on the front (pol-

ished) side of a 0.5 mm thick Si(100) wafer [20]. The 0.35

0.35 mm suspended membrane

was produced by anisotropic KOH etching of the Si from the back (unpolished) side [12]. All

holes were round in shape (see insets to Fig. 1), with the edge radius of curvature of order

30 nm. The hole diameter and period in diﬀerent samples varied in the range 1

7µm, and a typical perforated area was 150

150µm in size. Inset of the

Fig. 1 shows one fabricated sample with D = 2µm and L = 7µm. An FTIR microscope

(Perkins-Elmer Spectrum GX AutoImage) with spatial domain (100µm)2 has been used to

measure the transmission and reﬂection from the perforated and non-perforated areas in the

1500

700cm−1 spectral range. The FTIR microscope utilized Cassegrain optics with the

angle of incidence between 9◦

35◦. Input IR radiation was polarized by a wire-mesh (ISP

Optics) polarizer. To quantify the eﬀect of the holes, transmission and absorption spectra of

×

×

a non-perforated SiC membrane are subtracted from the corresponding hole array spectra

and plotted in Fig. 1 for several values of D and L.

Below we focus on the (D = 2µm, L = 7µm) sample. Although the deeply sub-λ holes

occupy only η = 6% of the total sample area, they increase the transmittance through

the sample by Th = 20% (from Tﬁlm = 10% to Tperf = 30%) at λtr = 11.95µm. This

3 transmission increase over the fractional holes’ area is quite remarkable; outside of the

×
reststrahlen (ǫ(ω) < 0) region of SiC the increase is much smaller than η. Even more

remarkable is the increase of absorption (up by almost 40% from < 1% in a non-perforated

ﬁlm) at λabs = 11.8µm. Other perforated samples (L = 5µm, D = 1µm) and (L = 7µm,

D = 1µm) were also experimentally studied and gave qualitatively similar results as shown

in Fig. 1. The absorption maximum is blue-shifted for smaller holes (λabs = 11.57µm for the

L = 7µm, D = 1µm sample) and for smaller periods (λabs = 11.49µm for the L = 5µm, D =

1µm sample), in accordance with the theory presented below which explains the anomalies

in transmission and absorption as manifestations of surface phonon polariton excitation.

This theory paves the way to the engineering of optical properties of polaritonic ﬁlms using

resonant excitation of surface polaritons. More complex three-dimensional materials can

3

then be built using multi-layer polaritonic ﬁlms as building blocks.

Because of the sub-λ nature of the perforated ﬁlm, it can be described as an eﬀective

medium with a frequency-dependent permittivity ǫeﬀ (ω) determined by several strongest

electrostatic (ES) resonances. Strengths and frequencies of these resonances are numeri-

cally computed using two diﬀerent formalisms: generalized eigenvalue diﬀerential equation

(GEDE) [22, 23, 24] and the surface integral eigenvalue equation [25, 26]. The former

method has been successfully applied to periodic sub-λ polaritonic crystals consisting of

non-connected polaritonic inclusions [24]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst

generalization of this method to the system with a continuous polaritonic phase.

The details of the GEDE approach as applied to periodic nanostructures consisting of two

material components (one with a frequency-dependent ǫ(ω) < 0 and another with ǫd = 1)

is described elsewhere [22, 27]. Brieﬂy, the following steps are followed. First, the GEDE

dipole symmetry periodic with period L in the plane of the ﬁlm. Second, the dipole strengths

fi proportional to the squared dipole moment of each resonance are calculated [23]. Finally,

the ES permittivity ǫeﬀ(ω) is found by summing up the contributions of all dipole-active

resonances:

corresponding diﬀerential quantities in Fig. 2. To facilitate the interpretation of the giant

transmission and absorption eﬀects, a segment of Re[ǫeﬀ], Im[ǫeﬀ ] dependence is plotted in

the inset to Fig. 2 near the strongest resonance at λ1 = 11.3µm, where Re[ǫSiC(λ1)] = ǫ1.

The absorption spike (dotted line) is due to the peak of Im[ǫeﬀ ] at λ = λ1. The trans-

mission maximum occurs due to the decrease of the absolute value of Re[ǫeﬀ] at λ = λmax

shown in the inset (solid line) to Fig. 2. Note that the enhanced transmission predicted from

ǫeﬀ occurs for λmax > λ1 in agreement with experimental observations. Other much smaller

absorption and transmission peaks are also predicted. However, experimental accuracy was

not suﬃcient to identify these additional variations of T and A in Fig. 1. Because spacing

between the holes (L = 7µm) was not negligible compared with the wavelength (λ

11µm),

∼

we have carried fully electromagnetic (EM) calculations of T and A using the ﬁnite-elements

frequency domain (FEFD) solver COMSOL. The results displayed in Fig. 2 show qualita-

tive agreement with the ǫeﬀ-based calculation, with the exception that all transmission and

absorption maxima are slightly red-shifted. This red shift is a previously noted [26] phe-

nomenon explained by the EM corrections to the purely ES response of sub-λ polaritonic

structures.

One manifestation of resonances of ǫeﬀ (ω) is an increase of the peak electric ﬁeld Emax

inside the hole in response to the applied across the structure ac electric ﬁeld with amplitude

E0. The ratio of Emax/E0 is plotted in Fig. 4 as a function of λ for a ﬁxed hole diameter

D = 2µm and variable period L. Four enhancement spikes corresponding to resonances of

ǫeﬀ(ω) can be identiﬁed for all periods. Frequencies of the three red resonances (λ > 10.5µm)

are located in the Re[ǫSiC] <
blue resonance (λloc ≈

former are very de-localized, while the latter is strongly localized near the hole (see the two

insets to Fig. 4). Identiﬁcation of the period-independent resonance as the LSP of a single

5

hole, and of the period-dependent resonances as delocalized waves related to SSPs of the

smooth ﬁlm is one of the main theoretical advances of this Letter.

To validate this identiﬁcation, we start with reviewing the properties of SPs of a smooth

thin negative-ǫ ﬁlm surrounded by vacuum. Through symmetry, SPs can be labeled by

the parity of the in-plane electric ﬁeld with respect to the mid-plane, and by a continuous

in-plane wavenumber k. A dispersion relation ω vs. k in the ES limit of k

ω/c is given

implicitly by ǫ±(ω) =

tanh(kH/2)∓1, where

refers to even and odd modes, respectively.

Note that even (“slow”) modes are located in the

Because k > ω/c for SPs, they cannot be excited by an EM wave incident from vacuum. A

perforated ﬁlm, however, acts as a crossed diﬀraction grating and provides coupling between

polaritons (SSP(m, n) [28]). This interpretation is veriﬁed by extrapolating the diameter-

dependent resonant ǫ for the two low-frequency eigenmodes to D = 0 shown in the inset

to Fig. 3. It is apparent from Fig. 3 that these two resonances correspond to excitation of

SSP(0, 1) and SSP(1, 1) of the smooth ﬁlm. Another conclusion that can be drawn from

Fig. 3 is that EM eﬀects shift the frequencies of SPs towards red. This explains the red shift

of transmission and absorption spikes in EM simulations from their positions in ES model.

No identiﬁcation with one of the smooth ﬁlm SSPs can be made for the LSP resonance at

λ = 10.45µm. In fact, this highly localized near the hole perimeter surface wave resonance

can be thought of as an even-parity “defect state” created by the presence of a single hole

in a negative-ǫ ﬁlm. Because the frequency range for which

1 < ǫ(ω) < 0 is a stop-

−

band for even-parity propagating SPs, the even-parity LSP can exist in this, and only this

frequency range. Because of the localized nature of the LSP, its frequency is insensitive to

the proximity of other holes (i. e. to the period L) but is sensitive to the aspect ratio of the

hole and even to the radius of curvature of hole edge.

In conclusion, we have experimentally demonstrated giant absorption and transmission

through optically thin SiC membranes perforated by a rectangular array of round holes.

These eﬀects are theoretically explained by introducing the eﬀective permittivity of a perfo-

rated membrane with a complex frequency dependence due to resonant coupling to almost-

ES surface phonon polaritons. Two types of phonon polariton resonances are theoretically

uncovered: (i) delocalized modes related to the SSPs of a smooth ﬁlm, and (ii) a localized

surface polariton (LSP) of a single hole that exists in the spectral range complementary to

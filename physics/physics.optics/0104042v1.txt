(February 2, 2008)

In the theory of optical gap solitons, slowly-moving ﬁnite-amplitude Lorentzian solutions are
found to mediate the transition from bright to coexistent dark-antidark solitary wave pairs when
the laser frequency is detuned out of the proper edge of a dynamical photonic bandgap. Catastrophe
theory is applied to give a geometrical description of this strongly asymmetrical ’morphing’ process.

The conﬁnement of optical radiation in periodic media (gratings) with nonlinear response occurs in the form of
gap solitons (GS), or more properly solitary waves, as ﬁrst predicted by Chen and Mills [1], and studied extensively
afterwards [2–8].
In Kerr media, the prototype model for GS is the following system of hyperbolic PDEs with
Hamiltonian (conservative) structure [9,10], which couples the forward u+(z, t) and backward u−(z, t) propagating
envelopes at Bragg carrier frequency ωB

Equations (1) have been conveniently written in usual dimensionless units z = ΓZ and t = ΓVBT , where Z and T
are the real-world propagation distance and time, Γ is the Bragg coupling coeﬃcient, and VB is the group-velocity
at Bragg frequency. Moreover S and X are coeﬃcients which specify the relative weight of self- and cross-phase
modulation, and u± are proportional to real-world envelope amplitudes. Equations (1) are usually analyzed with
S = 1 and X = 2 (one of the two coeﬃcients can be always set to have unitary modulus by a suitable rescaling of
the ﬁeld amplitudes) which describes scalar mode coupling, e.g., in optical ﬁber gratings [2–6]. Conversely we ﬁnd
convenient to leave them as generic coeﬃcients in order to describe both the cases of focusing (S, X > 0 [2–5]) and
defocusing (S, X < 0 [1]) nonlinearity, as well as the two limit cases X = 0 and S = 0, which arise, e.g., when the
cubic nonlinearity originates from cascading in quadratic media [11,12]. Cascading adds improved ﬂexibility since it
permits to control the sign of the eﬀective Kerr nonlinearity by tuning the wavevector mismatch. We also emphasize
that, in the case S = 0, Eqs. (1) reduce to the integrable (by means of the inverse scattering method) massive Thirring
model, and hence the localized waves are strictly speaking solitons.

Despite the fact that GS arise in a variety of physical settings and models, the importance of Eqs. (1) is threefold:
(i) they describe with reasonable accuracy optical GS experimentally investigated in ﬁber Bragg gratings [7] and
in corrugated GaAs waveguides [8]; (ii) though not integrable by inverse scattering method (except for the massive
Thirring case), the model allows to construct the whole family of solitary waves; (iii) Eqs. (1) have allowed to assess
the occurrence of peculiar eﬀects such as the onset of oscillatory instabilities [9,10], ultimately related with the absence
of material dispersion (i.e., second-order derivatives) which distinguishes Eqs. (1) from other soliton-bearing dispersive
models (e.g., those of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger type). GS of Eqs. (1) have been studied for more than a decade, and
both bright [2,3] and dark [4] solutions were reported. Yet, the existence of such GS solutions and their bifurcations
(how they change qualitatively against changes of parameters) were never investigated to full extent. Here we unveil
the bifurcation structure of GS, restricting ourselves to subluminal solutions for physical reasons. We show that
moving Lorenztian GS mark the transition between in-gap bright GS and dark-antidark GS pairs which coexist either
below or above (depending on the focusing or defocusing nature of the nonlinearity, respectively) the edge of a suitably
deﬁned dynamical gap.

Following the notation of Ref. [10], the entire family of solitary waves of Eqs. (1) can be characterized by seeking

solutions in the following form

of Eqs. (1), respectively [10]. Note that ∆ = 0 corresponds to the Bragg frequency, and v = 0 yields still GS, i.e.

Let us ﬁrst clarify the relation between the existence domain of these two families of GS and the stopband or

forbidden gap of frequencies exhibited by the grating in the linear operation regime. Bright solutions exist for
which is mapped into the inner domain ∆2 + v2 < 1 of the parameter plane ∆, v (such representation was already
adopted in Refs. [10,13]). This unitary circle can be regarded as a dynamical gap, since in this domain the linear
problem (i.e., Eqs. (1) with S, X = 0) yields exponentially damped traveling-wave solutions (u±
i∆t + iQζ),
with Q2 < 0). On the other hand, solutions with nonzero pedestal exist only outside this dynamical gap or unitary
circle.

To clarify further the role of the soliton velocity v, it is important to link the dynamical gap ∆2 + v2 < 1 with the
bandgap (henceforth termed rest gap to rule out any possible source of misunderstanding) of the stationary linear
coupled-mode problem. Such rest gap is well known to be related to the reﬂectivity bandwidth of the grating, in turn
measurable by means of a tunable cw laser in the laboratory (or rest) frame (z,t). Quantitatively, the rest gap is

the out-gap case

the (v-independent) lighter shaded domain shown in Fig. 1(a), which has a clear one-to-one correspondence with the
reﬂectivity bandwidth reported for comparison in Fig. 1(b). To map the dynamical bandgap in the same parameter
plane, we need to know what is the actual normalized GS frequency detuning in the rest frame, which is readily

As far as the terminology is concerned, a last important comment is in order. Bright solitary solutions of Eqs. (1)
< 1, light
δ1
are usually classiﬁed as gap solitons or Bragg solitons, depending on their detuning δ1 being inside (
|
shaded domain in Fig. 1) or outside (1 <
< γ, dark shaded domain in Fig. 1) the rest gap, respectively. Though
such a distinction can be useful to locate the operating frequency with respect to the reﬂectivity bandwidth of the
grating, it appears otherwise rather arbitrary. First, for any given velocity v there are no qualitative changes of the
solutions by crossing the boundary
= 1 between these two regions. Second and more important, the picture of
Fig. 1 suggests that all the existing bright localized waves are in fact gap solitons if referred to the dynamical gap.
In other words the eﬀective frequency gap seen by a soliton which moves at velocity v is wider (the faster the soliton
the wider the gap) than the rest gap measured through the reﬂectivity. This is also supported by the fact that δ
can be interpreted as the frequency detuning of the soliton in Lorentz transformed variables ζ, τ with τ = γ(t

which represents a ﬁnite-amplitude moving Lorentzian soliton, i.e., a GS with Lorentzian intensity proﬁle. The
existence of an exact solution of Eqs. (1) with non-exponentially decaying tails can be understood from the dynamical
system (3) as being associated with a degenerate ﬁxed point at the origin with zero eigenvalues. The fact that the
Lorentzian shape approximates well bright GS close to the upper bound of the gap was noticed earlier under strictly
stationary conditions (v = 0) [6].

Viceversa, for δ

1, i.e., close to the low-frequency edge of the dynamical gap, the intensity of the bright GS in

Eq. (5) [or, consistently, of its nonlinear Schr¨odinger approximation (7)] reduces to the following Lorentzian proﬁle

The bifurcation of GS can be eﬀectively explained in term of the catastrophe theory [19], and the underlying
classiﬁcation of the singularities of smooth functions. The quartic potential U (η) belongs to the so called cusp A+3

unphysical solutions (η < 0). Two catastrophes occur at the points δ = ±1.

According to our analysis, by varying δ in the range (

indicating the possibility to have solitary waves. Dramatic qualitative changes of the solutions must be expected at
1 where the control line becomes tangent to the bifurcation set. In spite of the apparent
the catastrophe points δ =

interchange of frequencies below (δ < 0) and above (δ > 0) the Bragg frequency. Indeed, the δ = 1 catastrophe
marks the point where the maximum of the potential (15) moves from a ﬁnite positive value for δ > 1 (which makes

1 < δ < 1 (where only one well is accessible for the asymptotic motion towards the origin which
1 marks the point where these bright GS simply
describes the bright GS). Conversely, the other catastrophe at δ =
cease to exist because the maximum of the potential moves towards negative values. In fact, though the potential still
has a double-well shape even for
1, the possibility to have solitary waves is ruled out by the fact that the
two wells become accessible only with η < 0, and hence the solutions are unphysical (recall that η is an intensity).

In summary we have shown that GS solutions of a well-known standard coupled-mode model with Kerr or Kerr-
equivalent nonlinearity undergo a bifurcation which is strongly asymmetrical with respect to the Bragg frequency. The
qualitative change of the solutions is explained with a geometrical picture based on the application of the catastrophe
theory. The bifurcation is marked by the existence of ﬁnite-amplitude Lorentzian GS. In this sense it is reminiscent
of the recently investigated case of localized waves sustained by a gap of full nonlinear origin [20]. In spite of the
diversity between the bifurcation discussed here and that of Ref. [20], this suggests that Lorentzian solitons can play
a universal role in the localization of light in periodic media.

We thank Yuri Kivshar for fruitful discussions concerning Lorentzian solitons.

[15] The Lorentz transformed time is written with light velocity c = 1, consistently with the normalization of Eqs. (1). Let
us point out that Eqs. (1) are not Lorentz-invariant except in the integrable case S = 0 of the massive Thirring model.
However, the consequence that, in general, moving GS cannot be generated by means of a Lorentz transformation of the
rest GS does not prevent from using Lorentz transformed variables (see also Ref. [9]).

We introduce the existence of stationary vortex entities nested in paraxial wave ﬁelds conﬁned by
trapping potentials, and discover that: (i) A rich variety of fully stationary vortex structures, termed
H-clusters, made of an increasing number of vortices can be built. (ii) The constituent vortices are
globally linked, rather than products of independent vortices. (iii) These stationary clusters can
exhibit, in the simplest cases, matrix or array geometries, and they feature a monopolar global wave
front. (iv) Clusters with multipolar global wave fronts tend to be non-stationary, when the number
of vortices and their location is not constant, or ﬂipping, when the vortices periodically ﬂip their
topological charges through extremely sharp Berry trajectories.

Introduction.- Singular wave structures, that contain
topological wave front dislocations [1], are ubiquitous in
many branches of classical and quantum science. Screw
dislocations, or vortices, are a common dislocation type.
They are spiral phase-ramps around a singularity where
the wave phase is undeﬁned and its amplitude vanishes.
Pure-wave or matter waves with vortices nested on them
ﬁnd fascinating applications in ﬁelds as diverse as cos-
mology, biosciences, ﬂuid dynamics or solid state physics
[2–5]. As striking examples, they are at the heart of
schemes to generate engineered quNits in quantum in-
formation systems in higher dimensional Hilbert spaces
[6,7], are believed to be a necessary ingredient to the on-
set of superﬂuidity in Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC)
[8,9], or allow tracking the motion of a single atom [10].
The dynamical evolution of the number and location of
the vortices nested on a localized wave packet observed at
diﬀerent planes, or foliations [11], depends on the evolu-
tion of the host beam, and on the mutual vortex interfer-
ence and nonlinear interactions [12–15]. Multiple vortices
nested on the same host typically follow complex dynam-
ical evolutions which might include vortex-pair collisions
and annihilations, that destroy their initial arrangement
during propagation. Therefore, a fundamental question
arises about whether families of fully stationary vortex
structures, also referred to as vortex clusters or pancakes,
made of vortices with equal and with opposite topolog-
ical charges can exist in physical systems governed by
Schr¨odinger or paraxial Helmholtz wave equations with-
out the help of stabilizing attractive or repulsive nonlin-
ear interactions. To isolate the pure vortex features from
the dynamics solely induced by the evolution of the host
wave packet, it is convenient to study wave ﬁelds conﬁned
by suitable potentials, as in trapped BEC.

In this Letter we show that clusters with multipolar

global wave fronts tend to be non-stationary, when the
number of vortices and their location are not constant
during dynamical evolution, or at best ﬂipping, when
the vortices periodically ﬂip their topological charges
through sharp Berry trajectories.
In the former case,
multiple vortex revivals mediated by Freund stationary
point bundles [16], that carry the necessary Poincar´e-
Hopf indices, can occur. In contrast, we expose that a
rich variety of fully stationary vortex clusters made of an
increasing number of vortices do exist. Importantly, we
ﬁnd that the corresponding clusters are globally linked,
rather than the customary products of independent vor-
tices. Also, they always feature a monopolar global wave
front.

lution of generic wavefunctions governed by the paraxial
wave equation:

metric case; hence nx = ny = 2. For convenience, from
now on we will split A(x, y; z) = F (x, y; z)V (x, y; z), tak-

the optical interpretation of (1) this is called the “host

essential information about the solutions and in particu-
lar about vortex dynamics. From a mathematical view-
point, in this work we will consider the evolution of poly-
nomial initial data for V corresponding to (multi)vortex
solutions of Eq. (1). Such solutions can be expressed as
ﬁnite series and, as will be clear later, all of them must
be periodic or stationary.

Evolution of “product” vortex clusters.- We ﬁrst
consider the evolution of vortex-clusters built as products
of n independent single-charge vortices: V (x, y; z = 0) =
n
yk)], where (xk, yk) are the loca-
k=1[x
Q
tions in the vortex cores in the transverse plane. Only
canonical vortices will be considered here, but analogous
results were obtained with noncanonical ones. None of
the above product-vortex clusters is found to be dynami-
cally stationary. On the contrary, the number of vortices
and their location is found to vary during evolution, so
that the initial vortex structure is destroyed. The de-
tails of the evolution depend strongly on each particular
case. The important results can be illustrated by exam-
ining the evolution of the 4-vortex cluster: V (z = 0) =
(x + a
iy + ia), which
−
contains two vortices with positive topological charge
and two vortices with negative charge in a symmetri-
cal geometry. This cluster features a quadrupolar global
wave front, as is revealed by calculating the gradient of
the wave front Φ far from the cluster core, to obtain
1/ρ3, where ρ is the polar coordinate, similar to
|∇
the corresponding electrostatic multipole [17]. Substitu-
tion into (1) yields the vortex evolution:

One ﬁnds three diﬀerent regimes of evolution, as shown
in Fig. 1: Vortex drifts, and vortex-pair annihilations and
revivals take place, so that depending in the value of the
geometrical parameter a, the total number of vortices, N ,
hosted in the wave ﬁeld during propagation can oscillate
between: (i) 4 and 8 (Fig. 1(a)); (ii) 4, 0 and 8 (Fig. 1(b));
(iii) 4 and 0 (Fig. 1(c)). When N = 0, it is understood
that all vortices have annihilated each other. The vortex
revivals from the vortex-free wave fronts are mediated by
Freund stationary point bundles [16]. Analogous evolu-
tions were found for octopoles and higher-order multi-
poles. Only dipoles can be made quasi-stationary, but
ﬂipping, when the corresponding vortex twins periodi-
cally ﬂip their topological charges [18]. Thus, the main
conclusion reached is that the interference between the
constituent vortices of all the product-clusters produces
beatings between the normal modes of the system, ren-
dering the clusters non-stationary.

Stationary states with several vortices.- The key

−

insight we put forward in this Letter is that such beatings
are not associated to the intrinsic or local properties of
the individual vortices, but to the very way the vortices
are globally nested in the host wave packet to form the
clusters. As an example, let us consider the evolution of
the 4-vortex cluster V (x, y; z = 0) = x2 + y2
a2 + 2ixy,
which contains four vortices located at the same posi-
tions and having the same charges as those of the vortex-
quadrupole considered above (Fig. 2(a)). However, in
this cluster the vortices are intimately linked to each
other, rather than individually nested in the host F . This
fact manifest itself in the global wave front of the clus-
(1/ρ3), and
ter, which behaves as

thus features a monopolar decay almost everywhere. One
readily ﬁnds that the vortex evolution is given by the ex-
pression V (x, y; z) = [x2 + y2

with a = 1/√2 does become fully stationary.

On physical grounds, this is one of the central results of
this paper and allows us to build a variety of stationary
vortex structures, to be perhaps termed Hermite, or H-
clusters. Next we discuss the inventory of clusters that
can be built, which contain not only apparent multipoles
but much richer structures, and show their main features.
H-clusters.- Perhaps the simplest type of H-clusters
n matrix geometry thus contain-
are those with a n
ing n2 vortices. These clusters can be generated by us-
ing as initial data, for example, Vn×n(x, y; z = 0) =
Hn(ξ)+iHn(η). In this function the vortex charges alter-
nate throughout the matrix and the vortex locations are
dictated by the zeroes of the particular Hermite polyno-
mials involved. In general these vortex matrices are not
regular, the distance between vortices varying along the
matrix. However, in the particular cases with n = 2 and
n = 3 the matrix is regular. The n = 3 case is shown
in Fig. 2(a). Notice that a 2
2 matrix cluster can be
generated either with V (x, y; z = 0) = H2(ξ) + iH2(η),
or with V (x, y; z = 0) = H2(ξ) + H2(η) + iH1(ξ)H1(η).
Actually, this latter possibility generates the stationary
4-vortex cluster discussed earlier (Fig. 2(b)).

tex matrices. A possible choice for the vortex function
generating such a vortex-matrix is Vm×n(x, y; z = 0) =
Hm(ξ) + iH|m−n|(ξ)Hn(η). As an example we show the
4
n
2 vortex matrix in Fig. 2(c). In contrast to the n
matrices, in the general case the topological charges car-
ried by the vortices of the m
n matrices do not alter-
nate sign throughout the matrix. An important subclass
of the m
1 cases, to
n vortex matrices are the m
be termed vortex arrays. They consist in m co-linearly
displaced vortices of the same topological charge. Fig-
ures 2(d) and 2(e) show illustrative examples. The sim-
plest array is the vortex-twin shown in Fig. 2(d): A
pair of identical vortices that, contrary to the vortex
dipole which either undergoes periodic annihilations and
revivals or charge ﬂip-ﬂops, can be made fully stationary.
More complex H-clusters also exist, and a full clas-
siﬁcation of all the possibilities falls beyond the scope
of this paper. However, an example of one of such
exotic H-clusters is displayed in Fig. 2(f), which cor-
responds to the cluster built with V (x, y; z = 0) =
H3(η) + i(H3(ξ) + H1(η)H2(ξ)). The rich variety of pos-
sibilities contained in Eq. (4) is clearly apparent.

(A) = U

The net topological charge of the H-clusters is equal
to the sum of the charges of the constituent vortices.
Thus, the n
n matrices are either chargeless for even
n, or carry a single net charge for odd values of n, while
the m
1 arrays carry a m total topological charge. In
any case, the wave front of all the H-clusters is found to
feature a monopolar decay (

1/ρ) almost everywhere.

norm), several states such as the 2
2 vortex matrix
and the 2
1 vortex-twin, were found to be dynamically
stable, the vortex locations displaying only small oscilla-
tions around the equilibrium position. Robustness during
propagation has been also observed in simulations with
small attractive interactions. We notice that such small
values of the nonlinearity strength U N are possible to
current experiments with Rb Bose-Einstein condensates
by using Feschbach resonances [22], thus the existence of
the H-clusters in a BEC should be experimentally acces-
sible.

Concluding remarks.- To conclude, we stress that
the constituent vortices of the H-cluster are globally
linked, rather than products of independent vortices.
Once such concept is adopted, one can generate a variety
of additional novel structures with fascinating proper-
ties. A nice new example are the circular vortex neck-
laces generated at the intersection between the circle
x2 + y2
e(V ) = 0, and the lines

a2 = 0, where

tan(2kπ/n)x = 0, k being a natural number, where
±
m(V ) = 0. Those are quasi-stationary, purely ﬂipping
ℑ
clusters made of n vortices (see Fig. 3 for a n = 8 exam-
ple), a feature so far only known to occur with vortex-
dipoles. Once again, the n vortices forming the necklace
are linked and thus do not exhibit a n-polar wave front.
We anticipate that the exploitation of such intrinsic link
might open important new opportunities in classical and
quantum systems based on topological light and mat-
ter waves. The ﬁrst challenge open is the demonstration
of the generation of the clusters, by suitable computer-
generated holograms [19] in Optics and, perhaps, phase-
imprinting techniques in BEC [20], respectively.

We examine some of the optical properties of a metamaterial consisting of thin layers of alter-
nating metal and dielectric. We can model this material as a homogeneous eﬀective medium with
anisotropic dielectric permittivity. When the components of this permittivity have diﬀerent signs,
the behavior of the system becomes very interesting: the normally evanescent parts of a P-polarized
incident ﬁeld are now transmitted, and there is a preferred direction of propagation.

We show that a slab of this material can form an image with sub-wavelength details, at a position
which depends on the frequency of light used. The quality of the image is aﬀected by absorption
and by the ﬁnite width of the layers; we go beyond the eﬀective medium approximation to predict
how thin the layers need to be in order to obtain subwavelength resolution.

I.

INTRODUCTION

An anisotropic material in which one of the components of the dielectric permittivity tensor has a diﬀerent sign
to the others has interesting properties. It supports the propagation of modes which would normally be evanescent,
and these modes travel in a preferred direction. The propagation of evanescent modes gives us hope that an image
produced by light travelling through a slab of such a material might retain a sharp proﬁle; also, because the preferred
direction depends on the ratio of the components of the permittivity tensor, it can be controlled by varying the
frequency of light used.

We ﬁrst look at a way of producing a metamaterial with the desired properties: by making a system of thin,
alternating metal and dielectric layers. A system of this type was proposed by Ramakrishna et al. 1 as a form of
“superlens”; it improves on the original suggestion for a superlens,2 which consists of just a single layer of metal, and
has recently been realised.3,4

We then look at the dispersion relation for our anisotropic material, to see why modes which would be evanescent in
both the metal and the dielectric separately are able to propagate in the combined system, and why there is a preferred
direction of propagation. The subwavelength details of the source are transmitted through the system because they
couple to the surface plasmons5 that exist on the boundaries between metal and dielectric; this mechanism is the
basis for the current interest in metallic structures for super-resolution imaging at optical frequencies.2,3,4,6,7

Next, we investigate the transmission properties of a slab of this material, and apply our formulae to the case of a
line source. We show that we can expect to obtain a sharp image as long as the amount of absorption is not too high.
Finally, we go beyond the eﬀective medium approximation to show the eﬀect of the ﬁnite layer widths on the optical
properties. We demonstrate that the “resolution” of the slab is limited by the width of the layers; thinner sheets
mean that the description of the system using the eﬀective medium becomes increasingly accurate, and the image
quality improves.

We concentrate on periodic layered systems of the form shown in ﬁgure 1. We assume that each layer can be
described by homogeneous and isotropic permittivity and permeability parameters. When the layers are suﬃciently
thin, we can treat the whole system as a single anisotropic medium with the dielectric permittivity9,10

A helpful way to see this is through the characteristic matrix formalism;8 this method, which is related to that used
by Rytov in the original derivation,9 is described in the appendix.

The homogenized magnetic permeability is given by expressions analogous to (1) and (2). When η is small, the
eﬀective parameters are dominated by the ﬁrst medium, while for large η, they resemble those of the second medium.
Only the ratio of the thicknesses of the two layers appears in the homogenized version, not the absolute value;
however, the characterization of the material using the eﬀective medium parameters is more accurate when both d1
and d2 are small.

For a layered metal-dielectric system, we can tune the response either by altering the frequency or by changing
the ratio of layer thicknesses.11 This is demonstrated by ﬁgures 2 and 3, which show the real and imaginary parts of
the eﬀective permittivity for two diﬀerent thickness ratios, for a system composed of alternating layers of silver and
silica. The material data from which these plots are constructed have been taken from the books by Palik 12 and
Nikogosyan 13. In both graphs, there are two regions in which
(ǫz) take opposite signs. In the ﬁrst region,
which includes energies up to approximately 3.2 eV,
(ǫx) is negative; in the second, which consists of a small range
of energies around 3.6 eV,

(ǫx) is positive.

By choosing a suitable value of η, we can make the real parts of ǫz and ǫx take opposite signs over a range of

frequencies. We investigate the consequences of this in the next section.

III. PERMITTIVITY WITH DIRECTION-DEPENDENT SIGN

The unusual behavior of the layered materials can be understood by considering the dispersion relation between
the frequency ω and the wave vector k. We assume that we are dealing with non-magnetic materials, so that the
magnetic permeability µ = 1.
If the dielectric permittivity is anisotropic, the interesting waves are those with
transverse magnetic (TM) polarization. The dispersion relation for these waves is

(4)

We have taken ky to be zero, since the x- and y-directions are equivalent. When ǫx and ǫz are both positive, the
relationship between kx and kz is similar to that in free space: for small kx, kz is real, but when kx becomes large,
kz becomes imaginary. The propagation of the wave in the z-direction is governed by kz; when kz is imaginary, the
wave is evanescent: it decays exponentially with z.

However, when ǫx and ǫz have opposite signs, kz is real for a much wider range of values of kx. Even the high
spatial frequency components with large kx, which would normally be evanescent, now correspond to real values of
kz, and hence to propagating waves.

If we want to plot the dispersion relation, we have to remember that the permittivity itself is frequency-dependent.
To get an idea of what the dispersion relation looks like, we can use an idealized model: we imagine a metamaterial
whose layers are composed of equal thicknesses of a dielectric, with positive, frequency-independent permittivity, and

For now, we assume that the materials are non-absorbing. The resulting dispersion relation is plotted in ﬁgure 4. We
can identify two distinct bands from the ﬁgure. In the lower, ǫx is negative, while ǫz is positive; the signs are reversed
in the upper band. In both cases, the contours of constant ω are hyperbolae. In the lower band, these hyperbolae are
centered on the kx-axis, while in the upper, they are centered on the kz-axis.

In fact, there is also a third band at high frequencies, but this is the least interesting regime and is not shown in

ﬁgure 4: both components of the permittivity are positive here.

The dispersion relation also provides the key to the preferred propagation direction. This is determined by the
group velocity. A constant-frequency section of the dispersion relation (cut across the ﬁrst band) is plotted in ﬁgure
5. The hyperbolic form of the curve means that for large

can see that the preferred directions form a cone around the z-axis. The half-angle of the cone is

In the region around kz = 0, the arrows point outside the cone. In this band, there are no propagating modes in a
small region around kx = 0, and no propagating modes with a group velocity vector lying inside the cone.

If we take a cross-section from the second band, instead of the ﬁrst, we also see a hyperbolic contour; the plot
resembles ﬁgure 5, but rotated by 90◦. The group velocities for the modes around kx = 0 now point inside the cone,
rather than outside.

To conclude this section, we look at the physical process that allows our layered metamaterial to mimic an anisotropic
material and to support the propagation of normally evanescent waves. The key fact is that surface plasmons are
supported at an interface where the permittivity changes sign. When the metal permittivity is negative, this sign
change occurs at every interface; the wave is transmitted via coupled surface plasmons, as indicated in ﬁgure 6.

by (5) with ǫm(∞) = 2.0, while the dielectric has permittivity ǫd = 2.5; the layers are of equal width (η = 1). kp is the wave
vector corresponding to the plasma frequency (kp = ωp/c). The ﬁrst two bands are shown; they have been separated to make
visualisation easier, but there is no band gap. The plots are symmetric about the planes kx = 0 and kz = 0.

IV. TRANSMISSION THROUGH AN ANISOTROPIC SYSTEM

We have seen that we can produce a metamaterial with interesting properties by stacking alternating layers of metal

and dielectric. Next, we look at a slab of this material, and examine the transmission coeﬃcient.

We assume that the slab is embedded in a uniform medium of constant permittivity (which may be unity, repre-

senting vacuum). In such a medium, the dispersion relation (4) becomes

The slab width used is d = 2/kp, which would be of the order of 100nm for a plasma frequency ωp ∼ 4eV. The results for three
diﬀerent frequencies are plotted, corresponding to the three bands referred to in the discussion of ﬁgure 4. The real part of ǫx
is negative when ω = 0.3ωp, while that of ǫz is positive; the signs are reversed when ω = 0.65ωp. At higher frequencies, both
are positive. The permittivity of the metal is taken to be ǫm = 1.7 + 0.6i − ω2

In ﬁgure 7, we plot the transmission coeﬃcient for three diﬀerent regimes, corresponding to the three diﬀerent
frequency ranges. At high frequencies (here represented by ω = ωp), both components of the metamaterial permittivity
are positive. In this regime, the transmission coeﬃcient is close to unity for small wave vectors. It drops abruptly
to zero at kx = k0, and rises equally sharply afterward, again approaching unity; ﬁnally, it decays exponentially for
larger wave vectors. Very similar behavior is observed in the intermediate frequency range (ω = 0.65ωp). This time,
the maximum following the zero at kx = k0 is higher, and the rate of exponential decay for large kx is less rapid.

The most interesting frequency range is the lowest one (ω = 0.3ωp). There is the usual zero in the transmission at
kx = k0, followed by a very sharp peak. However, there is also signiﬁcant transmission even for large wave vectors;
the transmission coeﬃcient has a series of peaks, decreasing in magnitude, and approximately periodic in kx. The
resonances correspond to localized states for the slab; they are in turn antisymmetric and symmetric. There is a
diﬀerence between the ﬁrst two resonances (just above kx = k0) and those for higher wave vectors. For the ﬁrst two,
the wave is non-propagating inside the slab (because kz is almost purely imaginary): the resonances therefore consist
of coupled surface plasmons located on each surface of the slab. For the higher wave vectors, the wave is able to

resonances – standing waves inside the slab.11

In fact, a similar set of peaks would be visible in the intermediate-frequency regime, were it not for absorption.
The material parameters used to generate ﬁgure 7 include a realistic amount of absorption, and a glance at ﬁgures 2
(ǫz) becomes negative. The localized states are supported
and 3 shows that absorption is high in the region where

IMAGING A LINE SOURCE

We have seen that the layered system allows enhanced transmission of high-spatial-frequency components at certain
frequencies. This gives us hope that we may achieve sub-wavelength imaging using the slab As a test, we consider
the image of the line source pictured in ﬁgure 8.

FIG. 10: (Color online) A schematic showing that reﬂections lead to periodically-repeated images of the two principal peaks.

First, we note that the position of the peaks is proportional to the slab width. This is a manifestation of the
preferred direction of propagation; within the metamaterial, the light travels at a ﬁxed angle to the z-axis, in the
xz-plane (since we have translational invariance in the y-direction). The secondary peaks which are visible when
k0d = 1.0 are caused by reﬂection from the boundaries; this is why they overlap precisely with the primary peaks for
the slab with k0d = 3.0. The reﬂections are illustrated in ﬁgure 10.

In the ﬁrst frequency regime, the approximate analytical solution is more diﬃcult to obtain: there are the additional
surface plasmon resonances close to kx = k0, for which one cannot make the near ﬁeld approximation. However, it is
still possible to obtain numerical results. As one would expect from ﬁgure 7, these are much more promising: using
realistic parameters, we are able to produce a sharp image, as shown by the line marked “Eﬀective medium” in ﬁgure
11. The width of the principal peak in the eﬀective medium approximation is around λ/10. Figure 11 also illustrates
the results of a more detailed analysis, which goes beyond the simpliﬁed eﬀective medium approach; we will discuss
these next.

VI. BEYOND THE EFFECTIVE MEDIUM APPROXIMATION

Treating the layered system as an eﬀective medium is a helpful simpliﬁcation, in terms of both understanding and
performing simulations. However, it has limitations. In this section, we model the system in more detail, considering
the ﬁnite width of the layers; naturally, as the layers are made thinner, we see that the eﬀective medium approximation
becomes more appropriate.

First, we look at the dispersion relation for the layered metamaterial. We can obtain kz as a function of kx (at a
given frequency) from the characteristic matrix, as described in appendix . These isofrequency contours are plotted in
ﬁgure 12. The eﬀective medium has full translational symmetry, but this is broken when considering the structure of
ﬁnite-width layers; the system becomes periodic, and the ﬁgure shows part of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, which extends
from kz =
πkp to kz = πkp. The eﬀective-medium contours are deformed by the new periodicity, and bend towards
for a given frequency, there is a value of kx above which no
the zone boundaries. This introduces a new cutoﬀ:
propagating solution exists. This aﬀects the resolution of the lens-like system.

−

The next logical step is to investigate the change in the behavior of the slab of metamaterial described in section
IV. From now on, we focus on the ﬁrst band. Figure 13 shows that the new cutoﬀ in kx is clearly manifested
in the transmission function: above the cutoﬀ, the transmission decays very rapidly. Below the cutoﬀ, we see the
familiar Fabry-Perot and coupled surface plasmon resonances, although they have moved slightly; this is because the
relationship between kx and kz has been altered, as shown in ﬁgure 12.

Finally, we re-examine the image of a line source using the modiﬁed transmission functions shown in ﬁgure 13.
Figure 11 shows the transmitted electric ﬁeld intensity, plotted as a function of x, for various diﬀerent layer widths.
Increasing the width of the layers which make up the metamaterial slab (while keeping the total slab width constant)
causes the principal peak to broaden, as expected. As the layers get thinner, the transmitted image more closely
resembles the eﬀective medium result.

VII. CONCLUSION

We have investigated a class of anisotropic materials in which the one of the components of the dielectric permittivity
has a diﬀerent sign from the others. These materials are able to support the propagation of modes that would normally
be evanescent: they are able to collect and transfer the near ﬁeld. In addition, inside the anisotropic medium, light
travels in a preferred direction.

FIG. 11: (Color online) The transmitted electric ﬁeld intensity for a line source, imaged by a metamaterial slab of thickness
1/k0. The material parameters used correspond to layers of Ag and ZnS-SiO2, embedded in crystalline Ge2Sb2Te5 (a phase-
change material used in optical storage devices), for light of wavelength 650nm. This corresponds to a total slab width of
around 105nm.

We have studied the transmission properties of a slab made up of such a material. The image of a line source
consists of two lines, with an oﬀset determined by the ratio of the components of the permittivity; the width of the
imaged lines depends on the amount of absorption, but in principle can be much less than the wavelength of light
used.

One realization of such a material is a stack of alternating layers of metal and dielectric. The thinner the layers, the
better this metamaterial approaches the form of the ideal anisotropic medium. We have shown how the ideal band
structure is deformed by the non-zero layer width. Using realistic material parameters, we have also demonstrated
that a stack of alternating Ag and ZnS-SiO2 layers can form an image of a line source which is much narrower than
the wavelength of light when working at 650nm.

The combination of subwavelength resolution with the fact that the position of the image depends on the frequency
of light being used suggests that this layered system may have useful applications. For example, in conjunction with a
super-resolution near-ﬁeld optical structure (super-RENS),14,15 it may allow the possibility of multiplexed recording.

APPENDIX: HOMOGENIZATION IN LAYERED SYSTEMS

The eﬀective medium parameters for our one-dimensional system of alternating layers can be calculated by using
the characteristic matrix method. The eﬀective dielectric permittivity is obtained from a consideration of TM ﬁelds;
TE ﬁelds give the eﬀective magnetic permeability.

for a system where the cell size (d1 + d2) is 1/kp; the result is a Brillouin zone of extent 2π on the kz-axis. The dashed lines
are the equivalent contours in the eﬀective medium approximation. The three sets of contours correspond to the three bands
of the dispersion relation discussed in section III; the ﬁrst two are hyperbolic in the eﬀective medium approximation, while the
third is elliptical. The material parameters are the same as those used to generate ﬁgure 4.

The geometry of the system is shown in ﬁgure 1, with the z-axis perpendicular to the layers. We take the plane
of incidence to be the xz-plane; the symmetry of the system means that this is equivalent to the yz-plane, and the
results which follow are general.

The characteristic matrix Mj(kx, d) relates the Fourier component of the ﬁeld in the plane z = z0 to that in the

plane z = z0 + d (all within medium j). For TM waves in a homogeneous medium, it takes the form8

These parameters appear in the dispersion relation for the eﬀective medium, which diﬀers slightly from (A.2) because
the permittivity is now anisotropic:

ǫx
We also note here that the cell matrix Mcell has another use. We can determine the true dispersion relation for the
layered system – without using the eﬀective medium approximation – by ﬁnding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
this matrix. When the eigenvalue has unit modulus, we have found a Bloch mode; we then make the association

The eigenvalue λ depends on the frequency and on kx; equation (A.10) is therefore the dispersion relation.

16 The idea of a propagating wave inside the metamaterial applies in the eﬀective medium approximation; in the microscopic

picture, the “propagating” wave is made up of coupled evanescent waves, as indicated in ﬁgure 6.

Abstract

The propagation of electromagnetic waves in the anisotropic medium with a single-sheeted hy-

perboloid dispersion relation is investigated. It is found that in such an anisotropic medium E-

and H-polarized waves have the same dispersion relation, while E- and H-polarized waves exhibit

opposite amphoteric refraction characteristics. E- (or H-) polarized waves are positively refracted

whereas H- (or E-) polarized waves are negatively refracted at the interface associated with the

anisotropic medium. By suitably using the properties of anomalous refraction in the anisotropic

medium it is possible to realize a very simple and very eﬃcient beam splitter to route the light. It

is shown that the splitting angle and the splitting distance between E- and H- polarized beam is

the function of anisotropic parameters, incident angle and slab thickness.

INTRODUCTION

Polarization beam splitter is an important device in optical systems, such as polarization-

independent optical isolators and optical switches [1, 2]. A conventional polarization beam

splitter is made of a nonmagnetic anisotropic crystal or a multi-layer transparent material [3,

4, 5]. The separation between E- and H- polarized beams produced by these conventional

methods is typically limited by the small splitting angle. While a large beam splitting

angle and splitting distance are preferable for practical applications, especially in the ﬁeld

of optical communication systems.

In general, E- and H- polarized waves propagate in diﬀerent directions in an anisotropic

medium. For a regular anisotropic medium, all tensor elements of permittivity ε and per-

meability µ should be positive. The recent advent of a new class of material with negative

permittivity and permeability has attained considerable attention [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Recently,

Lindell et al.

[11] have shown that anomalous negative refraction can occur at an inter-

face associated with an anisotropic media, which does not necessarily require that all tensor

elements of ε and µ have negative values. The studies of such anisotropic media have re-

cently received much interest and attention [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Although E-

and H-polarized waves can present the amphoteric refraction in conventional nonmagnetic

anisotropic crystal [16], the splitting angle is very small. A question naturally arise: whether

there exists a large splitting angle and splitting distance, when E- and H-polarized waves

propagating in certain anisotropic media.

In this paper we investigate the propagation of electromagnetic waves in an anisotropic

material with a single-sheeted hyperboloid dispersion relation. We show that E- (or H-) po-

larized beam is positively refracted whereas H- (or E-) polarized beam is negatively refracted

at the interface associated with the anisotropic media. There exists both a large splitting

angle and splitting distance, when E- and H-polarized waves in the special anisotropic me-

dia. We present a design of polarization beam splitters based on the anomalous refraction

in the anisotropic medium. To match the boundary conditions, the material parameters of

the anisotropic medium can be designed.

II. DISPERSION RELATIONS OF AN ANISOTROPIC MEDIA

Before we consider the beam splitter structure, we ﬁrst analyze the dispersion relation

of the anisotropic medium. For anisotropic materials one or both of the permittivity and

permeability are second-rank tensors [22, 23]. To simplify the proceeding analysis, we assume

the permittivity and permeability tensors are simultaneously diagonalizable:

εx 0 0

0 εy 0

0 0 εz



ε = 




where εi and µi are the permittivity and permeability constants in the principal coordinate

system (i = x, y, z).

We choose the z axis to be normal to the interface, and the x, y axes locate at the plane

of the interface. We assume plane wave with frequency ω incident from isotropic media into

anisotropic media. In isotropic media the accompanying dispersion relation has the familiar

form

x + k2

Here ki is the i component of the propagating wave vector and c is the speed of light in

vacuum. εI and µI are the permittivity and permeability, respectively.

In the uniaxially anisotropic media, the E- and H- polarized incident waves have the

feature.

Based on the dispersion relation one can ﬁnd that the wave-vector surface is a single-

sheeted hyperboloid. It should be mentioned that the propagation character in quasiisotropic

media C > 0 has been discussed in our previous work. We have shown that E- and H- polar-

ized waves have the same propagation character in quasiisotropic medium [17]. In present

work, we want to enquire whether E- and H- polarized waves have the same propagation

FIG. 2: The circle and single-sheeted hyperbola represent the dispersion relations of the isotropic

medium and the anisotropic medium, respectively. The incident wave vector k is parallel to the

Poynting vector SI in the isotropic medium. Because the anisotropy, ST must lie normal to

the frequency contour. The single-sheeted hyperboloid wave-vector surface has two types: (a)

For the purpose of illustration, the frequency contour will be used to determine the re-

possibilities for the refracted wave vector. Energy conservation requires that the z compo-

nent of poynting vector must propagates away from the interface, for instance, qE

z /εx > 0. Then the sign of qE

z can be determined easily. The corresponding

and qH

Poynting vector should be drawn perpendicularly to the dispersion contour. Thus we can

obtain two possibilities (inward or outward), while only the Poynting vector with ST z > 0

is causal.

We thus conclude that E- and H-polarized waves have the same dispersion relation while E-

refracted in such anisotropic media.

The above analysis suggest that a large splitting angle can be obtained by tuning the

anisotropic parameters. The splitting angle between E- and H-polarized waves can be deﬁned

construct an eﬃcient splitter?

IV. WAVES INCIDENT AT BREWSTER ANGLE

From the analysis of the previous section we know that E-polarized beam is positively

refracted whereas H-polarized beam is negatively refracted by the anisotropic slab. The

interesting properties allow us to introduce the potential device acting as a polarizing beam

The media parameters of anisotropic slab can be tuned to meet the requirements, for

example, the reﬂection coeﬃcient of a E-polarized wave equals to that of a H-polarized wave.

Based on the boundary conditions, the reﬂection and the transmission coeﬃcients can be

obtained [21]. For E-polarized incident waves, one can obtain the following expression for

the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients

one can obtain an interesting features: E- and H-polarized waves will exhibit the same

reﬂection and transmission, namely, RE = RH and TE = TH .

The reﬂection coeﬃcients of E- and H-polarized waves are plotted in Fig. 5. We choose

some simple parameters for the purpose of illustration, i.e., C =

1.

In Fig. 5a E- and

−

H-polarized incident waves exhibit a Brewster angle, simultaneously. When the incident

angle equal to the Brewster angle, the incident waves will exhibit oblique total transmission.

In Fig. 5b E- and H-polarized waves exhibit the same Brewster angle. We can ﬁnd E- and

H-polarized waves will exhibit oblique total transmission at same indigent angle.

To construct an eﬃcient splitter, we wish that E- and H-polarized waves can totally

transmit thought the anisotropic slab. We thus choose the incident angle equal to the

Brewster angle θI =θE

V. POLARIZING BEAM SPLITTER BASED ON THE ANOMALOUS REFRAC-

TION

The splitting distance (or walk-oﬀ distance) between E- and H- polarized beam is the

functions of anisotropic parameters, the incident angle and the slab thickness. The splitting

distance can be easily obtained as

d = 2 cos θI tan βE

S l,

(26)

where d is the splitting distance and l is the thickness of slab.

To obtain a better physical picture of beam splitter, a modulated Gaussian beam of ﬁnite

width can be constructed. Following the method outlined by Lu et al. [24], let us consider

a modulated beam incident from free space

E1(x, z) =

dk⊥f (k⊥) exp[i(k0 + k⊥)

iω0t],

where k⊥ is perpendicular to k0 and ω0 = ck0. A general incident wave vector is written as

k = k0 + k⊥. we assume its Gaussian weight is

f (k⊥) =

w0
√π

exp[

w2

0k⊥],

−

(28)

where w0 is the spatial extent of the incident beam. We want the modulated Gaussian beam

to be aligned with the incident direction deﬁned by the vector k0 = k0 cos θI ex + k0 sin θIez,

which makes the incident angle equal to the Brewster angle.

Matching the boundary conditions for each k component at z = 0 gives the complex ﬁeld

in the form

where T1(k) is the transmission coeﬃcient of the modulated Gaussian beam at the ﬁrst inter-

face. The transmission coeﬃcient can obtain a good approximation to simply evaluate this

quantity at k0. We set the waves are incident at the Brewster angle, then the transmission

coeﬃcient of the modulated beam is simply given by T1(k0) = 1. The normal component of

refracted wave vector qz can be expanded in a Taylor series to ﬁrst order in k0 to obtain a

better approximation

where T2(k) is the transmission coeﬃcient of the modulated Gaussian beam at the second

interface. E- and H-polarized waves can totally propagate thought the interface.

To this end, the intensity distribution of the transmission ﬁeld in the free space and

anisotropic media slab can be derived from Eqs. (27), (29) and (32) under the above approx-

imation. For simplicity, the isotropic medium is assumed to be a vacuum in our calculation.

Note that the refraction angles of energy of E- and H-polarized beams in the anisotropic

medium slab are almost exactly the analytical expression in Eq. (18). Our numerical results

indicate that it is advantageous to employ the anisotropic media slab as polarization beam

splitter.

Finally we want to enquire: how can the beam splitting eﬀect be studied experimen-

tally? Generally speaking, it is not strange to mention the question because no scheme

can be of much interest if the means of realizing it are not available. Fortunately several

recent developments make the beam splitter a practical possibility. An extremely promising

material has been previously explored in certain designs of photonic crystals, which can

11

be eﬀectively modelled with anisotropic permittivity and permeability tensors [25, 26, 27].

Therefore there is no physical and technical obstacle to construct the anisotropic medium

slab to split polarized beams.

VI. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have investigated the wave propagation in the anisotropic media with

single-sheeted hyperboloid dispersion relation. In such anisotropic media E- and H-polarized

waves have the same dispersion relation while E- (or H-) polarized beam is positively re-

fracted whereas H- (or E-) polarized beam is negatively refracted. By suitably using propa-

gation properties in such kind of anisotropic medium, it is possible to realize very simple and

very eﬃcient beam splitter. We show that the splitting distance between E- and H-polarized

beam is the functions of anisotropic parameters, the incident angle and the slab thickness.

We are sure that our scheme has not exhausted the interesting possibilities. In particular, it

might be imagined that a series of beam splitter could be constructed in more sophisticated

processes than those considered here.

In a recent Letter [1], Jeong, Dawes and Gauthier (JDG) claim to have achieved the ﬁrst

direct measurement of ”optical precursors” for a step-modulated ﬁeld propagating through a

anomalously dispersive medium. In fact such transients have been evidenced previously [2].

They are not identiﬁable with precursors (unless one considers that any coherent transient

propagating in a dilute medium at the velocity c is a precursor) and they can be interpreted

in very simple physical terms. We use the notations of [1] in our discussion.

The Sommerfeld-Brillouin precursors are strongly non-monochromatic signals preceding

the arrival of the quasi-monochromatic wave at the frequency ωc of the optical carrier. They

occur in a bulk medium with a broad absorption line and a large optical thickness when the

incident ﬁeld is switched on instantaneously or, at worst, in a time Tr comparable to the

optical period T0 = 2π/ω0 [3]. None of these conditions is met in the JDG experiments.
The observed transients have a spectrum of very small width [∆ω/ωc = O (10−8)] and thus

pertain to the quasi-monochromatic wave. We also remark that the general asymptotic

theory, specially adapted to the study of the precursors, fails to explain the experimental re-
sults (predicted amplitudes up to 1010 times too large, inability to reproduce the oscillatory

behavior at large optical thickness [1]). Conversely, the slowly varying amplitude approxi-

mation (SVAA) is fully operational since the switching time Tr, although much shorter than

the medium response-time, is dramatically long compared to 1/ωc . The signals obtained in

[1, 2] then have a simple physical interpretation.

The light transmitted by a dilute medium can indeed be seen as resulting from the

interference of the input wave, as it would propagate in vacuum, with the secondary wave

emitted by the electric polarization induced in the medium. When the incident ﬁeld is turned

on, the latter does not appear instantaneously and the front of the step-modulated pulse

propagates at the velocity c without attenuation. The envelope e(L, τ ) of the transmitted

ﬁeld at later times is obtained by solving the Bloch-Maxwell equation. When the medium

is optically thin, it reads e(L, τ )

E0Θ(τ )

iLω0p(τ )/(2ǫ0c) where p(t) is the envelope

−
of the polarization induced in z = 0 . The incident wave (the medium) being resonant

the exact result when α0L < 1/2. The corresponding intensity proﬁle ﬁts fairly well the

transient observed by JDG for α0L = 0.41 (see their Fig.1). Expressions valid at higher

orders in α0L can be obtained by an iterative procedure but it is more convenient to use the

This form (valid whatever α0L and τ are) makes again apparent the primary step-

modulated wave and the wave emitted by the medium. The ﬁrst order result is retrieved
by remarking that J1(x)/x = 1/2 + O(x2) when x << 1. At moderate optical thickness,
the eﬀect of the function weighting e−u in Eq. 1 is essentially to shorten the transient, as

observed by JDG for α0L = 1.03. When α0L >> 1, the transient takes an oscillating form.

Figure 1 shows the intensity-proﬁle of the transmitted pulse measured for α0L = 146 [2]. It

fully agrees with the prediction of Eq. 1. In particular the maximums of intensity exactly
occur at the retarded times j2
1,n/(2α0Lδ) , where j1,n is the nth zero of J1(x). Let us recall
that the oscillatory behavior is not reproduced by the standard theory of precursors [1].

Since on the contrary the transients reported in [1, 2] are in perfect accordance with the

theoretical predictions by Crisp [4], we suggest, to avoid any confusion, to name them Crisp

transients instead of Sommerfeld-Brillouin precursors. We ﬁnally remark that the validity of

the SVAA does not imply that of calculations involving truncated Taylor series expansions

of the wave number. For the step-modulated wave considered here, it is clear in particular

that the group velocity is not a relevant parameter.

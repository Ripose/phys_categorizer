Abstract: When a (frequency–domain) boundary value problem involving a homogeneous
linear material is solved to assess the validity of the Post constraint, a conﬂict arises between
the fundamental diﬀerential equations of electromagnetism in the chosen material and a na¨ive
application of the usual boundary conditions. It is shown here that the conﬂict vanishes when
the boundary conditions are properly derived from the fundamental equations, and the validity
of the Post constraint in modern macroscopic electromagnetism is thereby reaﬃrmed.

Introduction

The genesis of the Post constraint on the electromagnetic constitutive relations of linear mediums
was described in detail quite recently [1]. This structural constraint was shown to arise from
the following two considerations:

•

•

Two of the four Maxwell postulates (containing the induction ﬁelds and the sources) should
be independent of the other two Maxwell postulates (containing the primitive ﬁelds) at
the macroscopic level, just as the two sets of postulates are mutually independent at the
microscopic level.

The constitutive functions must be characterized as piecewise uniform, being born of the
spatial homogenization of microscopic entities. Therefore, if a certain constitutive func-
tion of a homogeneous piece of a medium cannot be recognized by proper electromagnetic
experimentation, the assumption of a continuously nonhomogeneous analog of that con-
stitutive function is untenable.

Available experimental evidence against the validity of the Post constraint for linear materials
was shown to be incomplete and inconclusive, in addition to being based either on the physically
inadmissible premise of purely instantaneous response and/or derived from a pre–modern version
of electromagnetism [1].

Nevertheless, solutions of very simple (frequency–domain) boundary value problems can be
invoked very easily to claim the invalidity of the Post constraint for linear materials. Indeed,
when a boundary value problem involving a homogeneous linear material is formulated to assess
the validity of the Post constraint, a conﬂict arises between the fundamental diﬀerential equa-
tions of electromagnetism in the chosen material and a na¨ive application of the usual boundary
conditions. In this paper, that conﬂict is easily resolved — in favor of the Post constraint.

The organization of this paper is as follows: Section 2 contains a brief review of modern
macroscopic electromagnetism, followed by a relevant presentation of linear constitutive rela-
tions in Section 3. The principal equations of a na¨ive formulation of boundary value problems
are set up in Section 4, and the aforementioned conﬂict is presented and resolved in Section 5.
The paper concludes with some remarks in Section 6.

2 Modern Macroscopic Electromagnetism

Let us begin with the fundamental equations of modern electromagnetism. The microscopic
ﬁelds are just two: the electric ﬁeld ˜e (x, t) and the magnetic ﬁeld ˜b (x, t).2 These two are
accorded the status of primitive ﬁelds in modern electromagnetism, and their sources are the
microscopic charge density ˜c (x, t) and the microscopic current density ˜j (x, t). Both ﬁelds and
both sources appear in the microscopic Maxwell postulates [2]

Spatial averaging of the microscopic primitive ﬁelds and source densities yields the macro-

scopic Maxwell postulates

which involve the macroscopic primitive ﬁelds ˜E (x, t) and ˜B (x, t) as well as the macroscopic
source densities ˜ρ (x, t) and ˜J (x, t). Equations (5)–(8) are the fundamental (diﬀerential) equa-
tions of modern macroscopic electromagnetism. Let us note that

(i) all four equations contain only two ﬁelds, both primitive, and
2The lower–case letter signiﬁes that a ﬁeld or a source density is microscopic, while the tilde ˜ indicates

here).

(ii) all four equations hold in matter–free space as well as in matter.

Indeed, modern electromagnetism may be called EB–electromagnetism to indicate the central
role of ˜E (x, t) and ˜B (x, t).

Equations (5)–(8) are not, however, the textbook form of the Maxwell postulates. In order
to obtain that familiar form, source densities are decomposed into free and bound components,
and the bound components are then quantiﬁed through the polarization and the magnetization,
both of which are in turn subsumed in the deﬁnitions of the electric induction ˜D (x, t) and the
magnetic induction ˜H (x, t). Then, (5)–(8) metamorphose into the following familiar form:

• ˜D (x, t) = ˜ρso (x, t) ,

Here, ˜ρso (x, t) and ˜J so (x, t) represent free or externally impressed source densities. Let us note
that ˜H (x, t) and ˜D (x, t) do not have microscopic counterparts and therefore are not considered
fundamental in modern electromagnetism.

wherein the integrals extend only over the causal values of (xh, th) in relation to (x, t). Five
constitutive functions are present in the two foregoing equations: ˜ǫ is the permittivity tensor;
˜ν is the impermeability tensor; ˜α and ˜β are the magnetoelectric tensors such that

and ˜Φ may be called the Tellegen parameter.

When (13) and (14) are substituted in (9)–(12) to retain only the primitive ﬁelds and the

source densities, the resulting four equations contain ˜ǫ, ˜α, ˜β and ˜ν in two ways:

(i) by themselves, and

(ii) through their space– and time–derivatives.

In contrast, ˜Φ does not occur by itself, but only in terms of derivatives [1]. The elimination of
this anomalous situation leads to the Post constraint

˜Φ(x, t; xh, th)

0 .

≡

(16)

Arguments in favor of and against the Post constraint were cataloged some years ago [3],
with the opposing arguments based on the so–called EH electromagnetism wherein ˜H (x, t) is
regarded as the primitive magnetic ﬁeld and ˜B (x, t) as the induction magnetic ﬁeld. The EH–
electromagnetism is a pre–modern formulation that is still widely used in frequency–domain
research. Opposing arguments of a similar nature have also been made under the rubric of the
heterodox EDBH–electromagnetism [4], wherein ˜D (x, t) and ˜H (x, t) are also supposed to have
microscopic counterparts and are therefore also considered primitive.

4 Boundary Value Problems

Constitutive functions are macroscopic entities arising from the homogenization of assemblies
of microscopic bound source densities, with matter–free space serving as the reference medium
[5]. In any small enough portion of matter that is homogenizable, the constitutive functions
are uniform. When such a portion will be interrogated for characterization, it will have to be
embedded in matter–free space. Typically, macroscopically homogeneous matter is characterized
in the frequency domain. Hence, it is sensible to investigate if the Tellegen parameter can be
determined by such a measurement.

Without loss of generality, let us consider therefore that all space is divided into two regions,
V+ and V−, separated by a boundary S. The region V+ is not ﬁlled with matter, whereas the
region V− is ﬁlled with a spatially homogeneous, temporally invariant and spatially local matter
characterized by the constitutive relations

D (x, ω) = ǫ(ω) • E (x, ω) + α(ω) • B (x, ω) + Φ(ω) B (x, ω)

H (x, ω) = β(ω) • E (x, ω) + ν(ω) • B (x, ω)

techniques [2, 7], and the representations of D (x, ω) = ǫ0E (x, ω) and H (x, ω) = µ−1

Much eﬀort is not required to solve the simplest boundary value problems. Relevant to the
Post constraint, reference is made to two papers wherein the boundary S is a specularly smooth
plane of inﬁnite extent [10, 11]. More complicated boundaries have also been tackled [9, 12, 13].
The inescapable conclusion from examining the results of boundary value problems is that the
ﬁelds scattered in V+ by the material contained in V− are aﬀected by the Tellegen parameter
(if any). Yet that conclusion is na¨ive and incorrect, as we see next.

5 The Conﬂict and Its Resolution

We have two very sharply contrasting Statements emanating from the foregoing frequency–
domain exercise:

A. The Tellegen parameter Ψ vanishes from the fundamental equations (18), (23) and (24)

for the material of which the chosen scatterer is made.

B. The ﬁelds scattered by the chosen scatterer contain a signature of the Tellegen parameter

(if any).

In other words, the Tellegen parameter is a ghost:
it does not have a direct existence in the
fundamental diﬀerential equations, but its presence may be indirectly gleaned from a scattering
measurement.

The ghostly nature of the Tellegen parameter is a consequence of the boundary conditions
(25)2 and (25)4. Even more speciﬁcally, it arises from the representations of D (x, ω) and
H (x, ω) in V−. It is instructive to decompose the macroscopic induction ﬁelds as [14]

D (x, ω) = Dactual (x, ω) + Dexcess (x, ω)

H (x, ω) = H actual (x, ω) + H excess (x, ω) )

are retained in (23) and (24). On the other hand,

are ﬁltered out of (23) and (24) by (18) but do aﬀect the boundary conditions (25)2 and (25)4.

The fundamental diﬀerential equations in V− can now be written as follows:

Boundary conditions in electromagnetics emerge from the fundamental equations [15]. There-
fore, consistently with (29), the correct boundary conditions on S are

• B (x, ω) = 0

instead of (25). Thus the correct formulation of the boundary value problem involves (30)2 and
(30)4 instead of (25)2 and (25)4.

To sum up, the conﬂict between Statements A and B arises from a na¨ive and incorrect formu-
lation of the boundary value problem. The correct formulation does not contain Dexcess (x, ω)
and H excess (x, ω) in V− as well as in the boundary conditions.

6 Concluding Remarks

Any ﬁeld that cannot survive in the fundamental diﬀerential equations is superﬂuous. Neither
H excess (x, ω) nor Dexcess (x, ω) survives, and may therefore be discarded ab initio. The Post
constraint thus removes the nonuniqueness inherent in (17), not to mention in (13) and (14),
which can appear in two of the four Maxwell postulates in relation to the other two postulates.
No wonder, de Lange and Raab [16, 17] could recently complete a major exercise — whereby
a multipole formulation of linear materials that was initially noncompliant with the Post con-
straint was made compliant.

In addition, the Post constraint also removes two anomalies: the ﬁrst is that of a constitutive
function not appearing by itself but only through its derivatives [1]; the second is that of the
Tellegen “medium” which is isotropic (i.e., with direction–independent properties) but wherein
propagation characteristics in antiparallel directions are diﬀerent.

A simple exercise shows that isolated magnetic monopoles can negate the validity of the Post
constraint [18, 19], but the prospects of observing such a magnetic monopole are rather remote
[20, 21]. Furthermore, although the electromagnetic characterization of matter–free space, even
in the context of general relativity, is compliant with the Post constraint [22], the axion concept
renders that constraint invalid [4]. No axions have yet been detected however [23]. Finally,
available data on magnetoelectric materials seems to negate the Post constraint [24, 25, 26], but
that data is faulty [1] as it is based on the neglect of causality [27] and a false manipulation
of the Onsager principle [28]. Needless to add, if either an isolated magnetic monopole or an
axion is ever discovered, or if a magnetoelectric material is properly characterized to have the

7

electromagnetic properties claimed for it by virtue of misapplications of various principles, the
Post constraint would be invalidated and the basics of EB–electromagnetism would have to
thought anew.

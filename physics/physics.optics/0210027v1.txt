Abstract

We present a new formalism for light beam optics starting with an
exact eight-dimensional matrix representation of the Maxwell equa-
tions. The Foldy-Wouthuysen iterative diagonalization technique is
employed to obtain a Hamiltonian description for a system with vary-
ing refractive index. Besides, reproducing all the traditional quasi-
paraxial terms, this method leads to additional contributions, which
are dependent on the wavelength, in the optical Hamiltonian. This
alternate prescription to obtain the aberration expansion is applied
to the axially symmetric graded index ﬁber. This results in the
wavelength-dependent modiﬁcations of the paraxial behaviour and
the aberration coeﬃcients. Furthermore it predicts a wavelength-
In the low wavelength limit our formal-
dependent image rotation.
ism reproduces the Lie algebraic formalism of optics. The Foldy-
Wouthuysen technique employed by us is ideally suited for the Lie
algebraic approach to optics. The present study further strength-
ens the close analogy between the various prescription of light and
charged-particle optics. All the associated machinery used in this for-
malism is described in the text and the accompanying appendices.

1 Introduction

The traditional scalar wave theory of optics (including aberrations to all or-
ders) is based on the beam-optical Hamiltonian derived using the Fermat’s
principle. This approach is purely geometrical and works adequately in the
scalar regime. The other approach is based on the Helmholtz equation which
is derived from the Maxwell equations. In this approach one takes the square-
root of the Helmholtz operator followed by an expansion of the radical [1, 2].
This approach works to all orders and the resulting expansion is no diﬀer-
ent from the one obtained using the geometrical approach of the Fermat’s
principle.

Another way of obtaining the aberration expansion is based on the al-
gebraic similarities between the Helmholtz equation and the Klein-Gordon
equation. Exploiting this algebraic similarity the Helmholtz equation is lin-
earized in a procedure very similar to the one due to Feschbach-Villars, for
linearizing the Klein-Gordon equation. This brings the Helmholtz equation
to a Dirac-like form and then follows the procedure of the Foldy-Wouthuysen
expansion used in the Dirac electron theory. This approach, which uses the

3

algebraic machinery of quantum mechanics, was developed recently [3], pro-
viding an alternative to the traditional square-root procedure. This scalar
formalism gives rise to wavelength-dependent contributions modifying the
aberration coeﬃcients [4]. The algebraic machinery of this formalism is very
similar to the one used in the quantum theory of charged-particle beam optics,
based on the Dirac [5]-[7] and the Klein-Gordon [8] equations respectively.
The detailed account for both of these is available in [9]. A treatment of
beam optics taking into account the anomalous magnetic moment is avail-
able in [10]-[13].

As for the polarization: A systematic procedure for the passage from
scalar to vector wave optics to handle paraxial beam propagation problems,
completely taking into account the way in which the Maxwell equations cou-
ple the spatial variation and polarization of light waves, has been formulated
by analysing the basic Poincar´e invariance of the system, and this procedure
has been successfully used to clarify several issues in Maxwell optics [14]-[17].
In all the above approaches, the beam-optics and the polarization are
studied separately, using very diﬀerent machineries. The derivation of the
Helmholtz equation from the Maxwell equations is an approximation as one
neglects the spatial and temporal derivatives of the permittivity and perme-
ability of the medium. Any prescription based on the Helmholtz equation is
bound to be an approximation, irrespective of how good it may be in cer-
tain situations. It is very natural to look for a prescription based fully on
the Maxwell equations. Such a prescription is sure to provide a deeper un-
derstanding of beam-optics and polarization in a uniﬁed manner. With this
as the chief motivation we construct a formalism starting with the Maxwell
equations in a matrix form: a single entity containing all the four Maxwell
equations.

In our approach we require an exact matrix representation of the Maxwell
equations in a medium taking into account the spatial and temporal varia-
tions of the permittivity and permeability. It is necessary and suﬃcient to use
8 matrices for such an exact representation. This representation makes
8
use of the Riemann-Silberstein vector, which is described in Appendix-A.
The derivation of the required matrix representation, and how it diﬀers from
the numerous other ones is presented in Appendix-B.

×

The derived matrix representation of the Maxwell equations has a very
close algebraic correspondence with the Dirac equation. This enables us to
apply the machinery of the Foldy-Wouthuysen expansion used in the Dirac

4

electron theory. The Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation technique is outlined
in Appendix-C. General expressions for the Hamiltonians are derived without
assuming any speciﬁc form for the refractive index. These Hamiltonians are
shown to contain the extra wavelength-dependent contributions which arise
very naturally in our approach. In Section-IV we apply the general formalism
to the speciﬁc examples: A. Medium with Constant Refractive Index. This
example is essentially for illustrating some of the details of the machinery
used.

The other application, B. Axially Symmetric Graded Index Medium is
used to demonstrate the power of the formalism. Two points are worth
mentioning, Image Rotation: Our formalism gives rise to the image rotation
(proportional to the wavelength) and we have derived an explicit relationship
for the angle of the image rotation. The other pertains to the aberrations: In
our formalism we get all the nine aberrations permitted by the axial symme-
try. The traditional approaches give six aberrations. Our formalism modiﬁes
these six aberration coeﬃcients by wavelength-dependent contributions and
also gives rise to the remaining three permitted by the axial symmetry. The
existence of the nine aberrations and image rotation are well-known in axi-
ally symmetric magnetic lenses, even when treated classically. The quantum
treatment of the same system leads to the wavelength-dependent modiﬁca-
tions [9]. The alternate procedure for the Helmholtz optics in [3, 4] gives the
usual six aberrations (though modiﬁed by the wavelength-dependent contri-
butions) and does not give any image rotation. These extra aberrations and
the image rotation are the exclusive outcome of the fact that the formalism
is based on a treatment starting with an exact matrix representation of the
Maxwell equations.

The traditional beam-optics is completely obtained from our approach
in the limit wavelength, –λ
0, which we call as the traditional limit of
our formalism. This is analogous to the classical limit obtained by taking
¯h
0 in the quantum prescriptions. The scheme of using the Foldy-
Wouthuysen machinery in this formalism is very similar to the one used
in the quantum theory of charged-particle beam optics [5]-[13]. There too
one recovers the classical prescriptions (Lie algebraic formalism of charged-
0, where –λ0 = ¯h/p0
particle beam optics, to be precise) in the limit –λ0 −→
is the de Broglie wavelength and p0 is the design momentum of the system
under study.

In this article we focus on the Hamiltonian description of the beam optics,

5

as is customary in the traditional prescriptions of beam optics. This also
enables us to relate our formalism with the traditional prescriptions. The
studies on the evolution of the ﬁelds and the polarization are very much in
progress. Some of the results in [17] have been obtained as the lowest order
approximation of the more general framework developed here. These shall
be presented elsewhere [18].

2 Traditional Prescriptions

Recalling, that in the traditional scalar wave theory for treating monochro-
matic quasiparaxial light beam propagating along the positive z-axis, the z-
evolution of the optical wave function ψ(r) is taken to obey the Schr¨odinger-
like equation

and n(r) = n(x, y, z) is the varying refractive index. In beam optics the rays
are assumed to propagate almost parallel to the optic-axis, chosen to be z-
1. The refractive index is the order of unity. For
axis, here. That is,
a medium with uniform refractive index, n(r) = n0 and the Taylor expansion

In the above expansion one retains terms to any desired degree of accuracy

the beam optical Hamiltonian one makes the expansion of the radical as
before, and retains terms to the desired order of accuracy in

with all the other terms (coming from the expansion of the refractive index
n(r)) in the phase-space components up to the same order. In this expansion
procedure the problem is partitioned into paraxial behaviour + aberrations,
order-by-order.

In relativistic quantum mechanics too, one has the problem of understand-
ing the behaviour in terms of nonrelativistic limit + relativistic corrections,
order-by-order. In the Dirac theory of the electron this is done most conve-
niently through the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation [19, 20]. The beam
optical Hamiltonian derived, starting with the exact matrix representation of
the Maxwell equations has a very close algebraic resemblance with the Dirac
case, accompanied by the analogous physical interpretations. The details of
this correspondence and the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation are given in
Appendix-C.

3 The Beam-Optical Formalism

Matrix representations of the Maxwell equations are very well-known [21]-
[23]. However, all these representations lack an exactness or/and are given
in terms of a pair of matrix equations. A treatment expressing the Maxwell
equations in a single matrix equation instead of a pair of matrix equations
was obtained recently [24]-[26]. This representation contains all the four
Maxwell equations in presence of sources taking into account the spatial and
temporal variations of the permittivity ǫ(r, t) and the permeability µ(r, t).
Maxwell equations [27, 28] in an inhomogeneous medium with sources are

The above optical Hamiltonian is exact (as exact as the Maxwell equations

We note that the upper component (ψ+) is coupled to the lower component
(ψ−) through the logarithmic divergence of the resistance function. If this
coupling function, w = 0, or is approximated to be zero, then the eight
dimensional equations for (ψ+) and (ψ−) get completely decoupled, leading
to two independent four dimensional equations. Each of these two equations
is equivalent to the other. These are the leading equations for our studies of
beam-optics and polarization. In the optics context any contribution from the
gradient of the resistance function can be assumed to be negligible. With this
reasonable assumption we can decouple the equations and reduce the problem
from eight dimensions to four dimensions. In the following sections we shall
present a formalism with the approximation w
0. After constructing the
formalism in four dimensions we shall also address the question of dealing
with the contributions coming from the gradient of the resistance function.
This will require the application of the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation
technique in cascade as we shall see. This justiﬁes the usage of the two derived
laboratory functions in place of permittivity and permeability respectively.

be borne in mind that in our exact treatment, both the terms were derived
from the Maxwell equations, where as in the Dirac theory the anomalous

square of the Hamiltonian in our formalism diﬀers from the square of the

B, the Pauli term which couples the spin
extra pieces (such as,
to the magnetic ﬁeld) which is absent in the Schr¨odinger and the Klein-

which give rise to the various extra wavelength-dependent contributions in
our formalism. These diﬀerences persist even in the approximation when the

where [A, B]+ = (AB + BA) and ‘

presence of the polarization term. Any further simpliﬁcation would require
information about the refractive index n(r).

· · ·

Note that, the paraxial Hamiltonian (23) and the leading order aberration
Hamiltonian (25) diﬀers from the ones derived in the traditional approaches.
These diﬀerences arise by the presence of the wavelength-dependent contri-
butions which occur in two guises. One set occurs totally independent of the
polarization term in the basic Hamiltonian. This set is a multiple of the unit
matrix or at most the matrix β. The other set involves the contributions
coming from the polarization term in the starting optical Hamiltonian. This
gives rise to both matrix contributions and the non-matrix contributions,
as the squares of the polarization matrices is unity. We shall discuss the
contributions of the polarization to the beam optics elsewhere. Here, it suf-
ﬁces to note existence of the the wavelength-dependent contributions in two
distinguishable guises, which are not present in the traditional prescriptions.

3.1 When w

= 0

×

In the previous sections we assumed, w = 0, and this enabled us to develop
4 matrices via the Foldy-Wouthuysen machinery. The
a formalism using 4
Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation enables us to eliminate the odd part in
4 matrices, to any desired order of accuracy. Here too we have the
the 4
identical problem, but a step higher in dimensions. So, we need to apply the
Foldy-Wouthuysen to reduce the strength of the odd part in eight dimensions.
This will reduce the problem from eight to four dimensions.

×

We start with the grand beam optical equation in (16) and proceed with
the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformations as before, but with each quantity in
double the number of dimensions. Symbolically this means:

where, w2 = w

The next degree of accuracy is achieved by going a step further in the Foldy-
(4)
Wouthuysen iteration and obtaining the
g . Then, this would be the higher
reﬁned starting beam optical Hamiltonian, further modifying the basic beam
optical Hamiltonian (20). This way, we can apply the Foldy-Wouthuysen in
cascade to obtain the higher order contributions coming from the logarithmic
gradient of the resistance function, to any desired degree of accuracy. We are
very unlikely to need any of these contributions, but it is very much possible
to keep track of them.

4 Applications

In the previous sections we presented the exact matrix representation of the
Maxwell equations in a medium with varying permittivity and permeability

15

following the recipe in [24]. From this we derived an exact optical Hamil-
tonian, which was shown to be in close algebraic analogy with the Dirac
equation. This enabled us to apply the machinery of the Foldy-Wouthuysen
transformation and we obtained an expansion for the beam-optical Hamil-
tonian which works to all orders. Formal expressions were obtained for the
paraxial Hamiltonian and the leading order aberrating Hamiltonian, with-
out assuming any form for the refractive index. Even at the paraxial level
the wavelength-dependent eﬀects manifest by the presence of a matrix term
coupled to the logarithmic gradient of the refractive index. This matrix
term is very similar to the spin term in the Dirac equation and we call it as
the polarizing term in our formalism. The aberrating Hamiltonian contains
numerous wavelength-dependent terms in two guises: One of these is the
explicit wavelength-dependent terms coming from the commutators inbuilt
in the formalism with –λ playing the role played by ¯h in quantum mechanics.
The other set arises from the the polarizing term.

Now, we apply the formalism to speciﬁc examples. One is the medium
with constant refractive index. This is perhaps the only problem which can
be solved exactly in a closed form expression. This is just to illustrate how
the aberration expansion in our formalism can be summed to give the familiar
exact result.

The next example is that of the axially symmetric graded index medium.
This example enables us to demonstrate the power of the formalism, repro-
ducing the familiar results from the traditional approaches and further giving
rise to new results, dependent on the wavelength.

4.1 Medium with Constant Refractive Index

Constant refractive index is the simplest possible system. In our formalism,
this is perhaps the only case where it is possible to do an exact diagonal-
ization. This is very similar to the exact diagonalization of the free Dirac
Hamiltonian. From the experience of the Dirac theory we know that there
are hardly any situations where one can do the exact diagonalization. One
necessarily has to resort to some approximate diagonalization procedure.
The Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation scheme provides the most convenient
and accurate diagonalization to any desired degree of accuracy. So we have
adopted the Foldy-Wouthuysen scheme in our formalism.

The beam-optical Hamiltonian is intrinsically aberrating. Even for the sim-

ders.

4.2 Axially Symmetric Graded Index Medium

We just saw the treatment of the medium with a constant refractive index.
This is perhaps the only problem which can be solved exactly in a closed
form expression. This was just to illustrate how the aberration expansion
in our formalism can be obtained. We now consider the next example. The
refractive index of an axially symmetric graded-index material can be most
generally described by the following polynomial (see, pp. 117 in [1])

n (r) = n0 + α2(z)r2

Thus we see that the current approach gives rise to all the nine permissible
aberrations. The six aberrations, familiar from the traditional prescriptions
get modiﬁed by the wavelength-dependent contributions. The extra three (k,
a and d, all anisotropic!) are all pure wavelength-dependent aberrations and
totally absent in the traditional square-root approach [1, 2] and the recently
developed scalar approach [3, 4]. A detailed account on the classiﬁcation of
aberrations is available in [31]-[34].

5 Polarization

Let there be Light! (with or/and without polarization) [18].

6 Concluding Remarks

We have developed an exact matrix representation of the Maxwell equations
taking into account the spatial and temporal variations of the permittivity
and permeability. This representation, using 8
8 matrices is the basis for an
exact formalism of Maxwell optics presented here. The exact beam optical
Hamiltonian, derived from this representation has an algebraic structure in
direct correspondence with the Dirac equation of the electron. We exploit
this correspondence to adopt the standard machinery, namely the Foldy-

×

24

Wouthuysen transformation technique of the Dirac theory, to the beam op-
tical formalism. This enabled us to obtain a systematic procedure to obtain
the aberration expansion from the beam-optical Hamiltonian to any desired
degree of accuracy. We further get the wavelength-dependent contributions
at each order, starting with the lowest-order paraxial paraxial Hamiltonian.
Formal expressions were obtained for the paraxial and leading order aberrat-
ing Hamiltonians, without making any assumption on the form of the varying
refractive index.

The beam-optical Hamiltonians also have the wavelength-dependent ma-
trix terms which are associated with the polarization. In this approach we
have been able to derive a Hamiltonian which contains both the beam-optics
and the polarization.

In Section-IV, we applied the formalism to the speciﬁc examples and saw
how the beam-optics (paraxial behaviour and the aberrations) gets modiﬁed
by the wavelength-dependent contributions. First of the two examples is the
medium with a constant refractive index. This is perhaps the only problem
which can be solved exactly, in a closed form expression. This example is
primarily for illustrating certain aspects of the machinery we have used.

The second, and the much more interesting example is that of the axially
symmetric graded index medium. For this example, in the traditional ap-
proaches one gets only six aberrations. In our formalism we get all the nine
aberrations permitted by the axial symmetry. The six aberration coeﬃcients
of the traditional approaches get modiﬁed by the wavelength-dependent con-
It is very interesting to note that apart from the wavelength-
tributions.
dependent modiﬁcations of the aberrations, this approach also gives rise to
the image rotation. This image rotation is proportional to the wavelength
and we have derived an explicit relationship for the angle in (46). Such, an
image rotation has no analogue/counterpart in any of the traditional pre-
scriptions. It would be worthwhile to experimentally look for the predicted
image rotation. The existence of the nine aberrations and image rotation
are well-known in axially symmetric magnetic electron lenses, even when
treated classically. The quantum treatment of the same system leads to the
wavelength-dependent modiﬁcations [9].

The optical Hamiltonian has two components: Beam-Optics and Polar-
ization respectively. We have addressed the former in some detail and the
later is in progress. The formalism initiated in this article provides a natural
framework for the study of light polarization. This would provide a uniﬁed

25

treatment for the beam-optics and the polarization. It also promises a pos-
sible generalization of the substitution result in [17]. We shall present this
approach elsewhere [18].

The close analogy between geometrical optics and charged-particle beam
optics has been known for too long a time. Until recently it was possible to
see this analogy only between the geometrical optics and the classical pre-
scriptions of charge-particle optics. A quantum theory of charged-particle
optics was presented in recent years [5]-[10]. With the current development
of the non-traditional prescriptions of Helmholtz optics [3, 4] and the ma-
trix formulation of Maxwell optics presented here, using the rich algebraic
machinery of quantum mechanics it is now possible to see a parallel of the
analogy at each level. The non-traditional prescription of the Helmholtz op-
tics is in close analogy with the quantum theory of charged-particles based on
the Klein-Gordon equation. The matrix formulation of Maxwell optics pre-
sented here is in close analogy with the quantum theory of charged-particles
based on the Dirac equation [35]. The parallel of these analogies is described
in Appendix-E.

An important omission in the present study is the study of the evolution of
the ﬁelds, (E , B), which we shall address in detail elsewhere [18]. Even with-
out the discussion of the ﬁelds (as is the case in several other prescriptions)
the present study is complete at the Hamiltonian level. We have presented
an alternate and exact way of deriving the beam optical Hamiltonian, which
reproduces the established results. Furthermore we have derived the extra
wavelength-dependent contributions. In the low wavelength limit our formal-
ism reproduces the Lie algebraic formalism of optics. The Foldy-Wouthuysen
technique employed by us is ideally suited for the Lie algebraic approach to
optics. The present study further strengthens the close analogy between the
various prescription of light and charged-particle beam optics [35].

Appendix-B
An Exact Matrix Representation of the
Maxwell Equations in a Medium

Matrix representations of the Maxwell equations are very well-known [21]-
[23]. However, all these representations lack an exactness or/and are given in
terms of a pair of matrix equations. Some of these representations are in free
space. Such a representation is an approximation in a medium with space-
and time-dependent permittivity ǫ(r, t) and permeability µ(r, t) respectively.
Even this approximation is often expressed through a pair of equations using
3 matrices: one for the curl and one for the divergence which occur in the
3
Maxwell equations. This practice of writing the divergence condition sepa-
4 matrices for Maxwell equations
rately is completely avoidable by using 4
in free-space [21]. A single equation using 4
4 matrices is necessary and
suﬃcient when ǫ(r, t) and µ(r, t) are treated as ‘local’ constants [21, 23].

×

×

×

A treatment taking into account the variations of ǫ(r, t) and µ(r, t) has
been presented in [23]. This treatment uses the Riemann-Silberstein vectors,
F ± (r, t) to reexpress the Maxwell equations as four equations: two equations
are for the curl and two are for the divergences and there is mixing in F + (r, t)
and F − (r, t). This mixing is very neatly expressed through the two derived
functions of ǫ(r, t) and µ(r, t). These four equations are then expressed as a
6 matrices: again one for the curl and one
pair of matrix equations using 6
for the divergence. Even though this treatment is exact it involves a pair of
matrix equations.

×

Here, we present a treatment which enables us to express the Maxwell
equations in a single matrix equation instead of a pair of matrix equations.
Our approach is a logical continuation of the treatment in [23]. We use the
linear combination of the components of the Riemann-Silberstein vectors,
F ± (r, t) and the ﬁnal matrix representation is a single equation using 8
8
matrices. This representation contains all the four Maxwell equations in
presence of sources taking into account the spatial and temporal variations
of the permittivity ǫ(r, t) and the permeability µ(r, t).

×

In Section-I we shall summarize the treatment for a homogeneous medium
In Section-II we shall

and introduce the required functions and notation.

29

present the matrix representation in an inhomogeneous medium, in presence
of sources.

B.1 Homogeneous Medium

We shall start with the Maxwell equations [27, 28] in an inhomogeneous
medium with sources,

We assume the media to be linear, that is D = ǫE, and B = µH, where
ǫ is the permittivity of the medium and µ is the permeability of the
medium. In general ǫ = ǫ(r, t) and µ = µ(r, t). In this section we treat them
as ‘local’ constants in the various derivations. The magnitude of the velocity
of light in the medium is given by v(r, t) =
ǫ(r, t)µ(r, t). In

(B.2)

For any homogeneous medium it is equivalent to use either F + (r, t) or
F − (r, t). The two diﬀer by the sign before ‘i’ and are not the complex
conjugate of one another. We have not assumed any form for E(r, t) and
B(r, t). We will be needing both of them in an inhomogeneous medium, to
be considered in detail in Section-II.

If for a certain medium ǫ(r, t) and µ(r, t) are constants (or can be treated
as ‘local’ constants under certain approximations), then the vectors F ± (r, t)

(B.3)

Thus, by using the Riemann-Silberstein vector it has been possible to reex-
press the four Maxwell equations (for a medium with constant ǫ and µ) as
two equations. The ﬁrst one contains the the two Maxwell equations with
curl and the second one contains the two Maxwell with divergences. The
ﬁrst of the two equations in (B.3) can be immediately converted into a 3
3
matrix representation. However, this representation does not contain the di-
vergence conditions (the ﬁrst and the fourth Maxwell equations) contained
in the second equation in (B.3). A further compactiﬁcation is possible only
by expressing the Maxwell equations in a 4
4 matrix representation. To
this end, using the components of the Riemann-Silberstein vector, we deﬁne,

Each of the four Maxwell equations are easily obtained from the matrix
representation in (B.6). This is done by taking the sums and diﬀerences of
row-I with row-IV and row-II with row-III respectively. The ﬁrst three give
the y, x and z components of the curl and the last one gives the divergence
conditions present in the evolution equation (B.3).

It is to be noted that the matrices M are all non-singular and all are
hermitian. Moreover, they satisfy the usual algebra of the Dirac matrices,
including,

Before proceeding further we note the following: The pair (Ψ±, M ) are
not unique. Diﬀerent choices of Ψ± would give rise to diﬀerent M , such

(B.9)

that the triplet M continues to to satisfy the algebra of the Dirac matrices
in (B.9). We have preferred Ψ± via the the Riemann-Silberstein vector (B.2)
in [23]. This vector has certain advantages over the other possible choices.
The Riemann-Silberstein vector is well-known in classical electrodynamics
and has certain interesting properties and uses [23].

In deriving the above 4

4 matrix representation of the Maxwell equations
we have ignored the spatial and temporal derivatives of ǫ(r, t) and µ(r, t) in
the ﬁrst two of the Maxwell equations. We have treated ǫ and µ as ‘local’
constants.

×

B.2

Inhomogeneous Medium

In the previous section we wrote the evolution equations for the Riemann-
Silberstein vector in (B.3), for a medium, treating ǫ(r, t) and µ(r, t) as ‘local’
constants. From these pairs of equations we wrote the matrix form of the
Maxwell equations. In this section we shall write the exact equations taking
into account the spatial and temporal variations of ǫ(r, t) and µ(r, t). It is
very much possible to write the required evolution equations using ǫ(r, t) and
µ(r, t). But we shall follow the procedure in [23] of using the two derived
laboratory functions

Velocity Function : v(r, t) =

Resistance Function : h(r, t) =

(B.10)

The function, v(r, t) has the dimensions of velocity and the function, h(r, t)
has the dimensions of resistance (measured in Ohms). We can equivalently
use the Conductance Function, κ(r, t) = 1/h(r, t) = ǫ(r, t)/µ(r, t) (measured
in Ohms−1 or Mhos!)
in place of the resistance function, h(r, t). These
derived functions enable us to understand the dependence of the variations
more transparently [23]. Moreover the derived functions are the ones which
are measured experimentally. In terms of these functions, ǫ = 1/√vh and
h/v. Using these functions the exact equations satisﬁed by F ± (r, t)

The above representation contains thirteen 8
8 matrices! Ten of these
are hermitian. The exceptional ones are the ones that contain the three
components of w(r, t), the logarithmic gradient of the resistance function.
These three matrices, for the resistance function are antihermitian.

We have been able to express the Maxwell equations in a matrix form in a
medium with varying permittivity ǫ(r, t) and permeability µ(r, t), in presence
of sources. We have been able to do so using a single equation instead of a
pair of matrix equations. We have used 8
8 matrices and have been able
to separate the dependence of the coupling between the upper components
(Ψ+) and the lower components (Ψ−) through the two laboratory functions.
Moreover the exact matrix representation has an algebraic structure very
similar to the Dirac equation. We feel that this representation would be more
suitable for some of the studies related to the photon wave function [23].

In the traditional scheme the purpose of expanding the light optics Hamil-
tonian
as the expansion
parameter is to understand the propagation of the quasiparaxial beam in
terms of a series of approximations (paraxial + nonparaxial). Similar is the
situation in the case of the charged-particle optics. Let us recall that in rela-
tivistic quantum mechanics too one has a similar problem of understanding
the relativistic wave equations as the nonrelativistic approximation plus the
relativistic correction terms in the quasirelativistic regime. For the Dirac
equation (which is ﬁrst order in time) this is done most conveniently using
the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation leading to an iterative diagonalization
technique.

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

b

The main framework of the formalism of optics, used here (and in the
charged-particle optics) is based on the transformation technique of the
Foldy-Wouthuysen theory which casts the Dirac equation in a form dis-
playing the diﬀerent interaction terms between the Dirac particle and and
an applied electromagnetic ﬁeld in a nonrelativistic and easily interpretable
form (see, [19], [36]-[38], for a general discussion of the role of the Foldy-
Wouthuysen-type transformations in particle interpretation of relativistic
wave equations). The suggestion to employ the Foldy-Wouthuysen Trans-
formation technique in the case of the Helmholtz equation was mentioned
in the literature as a remark [39].
It was only in the recent works, that
this idea was exploited to analyze the quasiparaxial approximations for for
speciﬁc beam optical system [3, 4]. The Foldy-Wouthuysen technique is ide-
ally suited for the Lie algebraic approach to optics. With all these plus
points, the powerful and ambiguity-free expansion, the Foldy-Wouthuysen
Transformation is still little used in optics [40]. In the Foldy-Wouthuysen
theory the Dirac equation is decoupled through a canonical transformation
into two two-component equations: one reduces to the Pauli equation in the
nonrelativistic limit and the other describes the negative-energy states.

Let us describe here brieﬂy the standard Foldy-Wouthuysen theory so that
the way it has been adopted for the purposes of the above studies in optics

In the general case, when the electron is in a time-dependent electromag-
S) which removes the odd
netic ﬁeld it is not possible to construct an exp(i
operators from the transformed Hamiltonian completely. Therefore, one has
to be content with a nonrelativistic expansion of the transformed Hamilto-
nian in a power series in 1/m0c2 keeping through any desired order. Note

the electrostatic and magnetic dipole energies. The next two terms, taken
together (for hermiticity), contain the spin-orbit interaction. The last term,
the so-called Darwin term, is attributed to the zitterbewegung (trembling
motion) of the Dirac particle: because of the rapid coordinate ﬂuctuations
over distances of the order of the Compton wavelength (2π¯h/m0c) the particle

u(t0 + 3∆t) = e∆t ˆA(t0+2∆t)e∆t ˆA(t0+∆t)e∆t ˆA(t0)u(t0)

Analogies between light optics and
charged-particle optics: Recent Developments

Historically, variational principles have played a fundamental role in the
evolution of mathematical models in classical physics, and many equations
can be derived by using them. Here the relevant examples are Fermat’s prin-
ciple in optics and Maupertuis’ principle in mechanics. The beginning of the
analogy between geometrical optics and mechanics is usually attributed to
Descartes (1637), but actually it can traced back to Ibn Al-Haitham Alhazen
(0965-1037) [44]. The analogy between the trajectory of material particles in
potential ﬁelds and the path of light rays in media with continuously variable
refractive index was formalized by Hamilton in 1833. This Hamiltonian anal-
ogy lead to the development of electron optics in 1920s, when Busch derived
the focusing action and a lens-like action of the axially symmetric magnetic
ﬁeld using the methodology of geometrical optics. Around the same time
Louis de Broglie associated his now famous wavelength to moving particles.
Schr¨odinger extended the analogy by passing from geometrical optics to wave
optics through his wave equation incorporating the de Broglie wavelength.
This analogy played a fundamental role in the early development of quan-
tum mechanics. The analogy, on the other hand, lead to the development
of practical electron optics and one of the early inventions was the electron
microscope by Ernst Ruska. A detailed account of Hamilton’s analogy is
available in [45]-[47].

Until very recently, it was possible to see this analogy only between the
geometrical-optic and classical prescriptions of electron optics. The reasons
being that, the quantum theories of charged-particle beam optics have been
under development only for about a decade [5]-[13] with the very expected
feature of wavelength-dependent eﬀects, which have no analogue in the tra-
ditional descriptions of light beam optics. With the current development
of the non-traditional prescriptions of Helmholtz optics [3, 4] and the ma-
trix formulation of Maxwell optics, accompanied with wavelength-dependent
eﬀects, it is seen that the analogy between the two systems persists. The
non-traditional prescription of Helmholtz optics is in close analogy with the

47

quantum theory of charged-particle beam optics based on the Klein-Gordon
equation. The matrix formulation of Maxwell optics is in close analogy with
the quantum theory of charged-particle beam optics based on the Dirac equa-
tion. This analogy is summarized in the table of Hamiltonians. In this short
note it is diﬃcult to present the derivation of the various Hamiltonians which
are available in the references. We shall brieﬂy consider an outline of the
quantum prescriptions and the non-traditional prescriptions respectively. A
complete coverage to the new ﬁeld of Quantum Aspects of Beam Physics
(QABP), can be found in the proceedings of the series of meetings under
the same name [48].

E.1 Quantum Formalism of Charged-Particle Beam Op-

tics

The classical treatment of charged-particle beam optics has been extremely
successful in the designing and working of numerous optical devices, from
electron microscopes to very large particle accelerators. It is natural, however
to look for a prescription based on the quantum theory, since any physical
system is quantum mechanical at the fundamental level! Such a prescription
is sure to explain the grand success of the classical theories. It is sure to help
get a deeper understanding and lead to better designing of charged-particle
beam devices.

The starting point of the quantum prescription of charged particle beam
optics is to build a theory based on the basic equations of quantum mechanics
(Schr¨odinger, Klein-Gordon, Dirac) appropriate to the situation under study.
In order to analyze the evolution of the beam parameters of the various
) along
individual beam optical elements (quadrupoles, bending magnets,
the optic axis of the system, the ﬁrst step is to start with the basic time-
dependent equations of quantum mechanics and then obtain an equation of
the form

(x, y; s) ψ (x, y; s) ,

where (x, y; s) constitute a curvilinear coordinate system, adapted to the

geometry of the system. Eq. (E.1) is the basic equation in the quantum
and ψ as the beam-optical

The two-step algorithm stated above gives an over-simpliﬁed picture of
the quantum formalism. There are several crucial points to be noted. The
ﬁrst step in the algorithm of obtaining the beam-optical equation is not to be
treated as a mere transformation which eliminates t in preference to a variable
s along the optic axis. A clever set of transforms are required which not only
eliminate the variable t in preference to s but also give us the s-dependent
equation which has a close physical and mathematical correspondence with
the original t-dependent equation of standard time-dependent quantum me-
chanics. The imposition of this stringent requirement on the construction
of the beam-optical equation ensures the execution of the second-step of the
algorithm. The beam-optical equation is such that all the required rich ma-
chinery of quantum mechanics becomes applicable to the computation of
the transfer maps that characterize the optical system. This describes the
essential scheme of obtaining the quantum formalism. The rest is mostly
mathematical detail which is inbuilt in the powerful algebraic machinery
of the algorithm, accompanied with some reasonable assumptions and ap-
proximations dictated by the physical considerations. The nature of these
approximations can be best summarized in the optical terminology as a sys-
tematic procedure of expanding the beam optical Hamiltonian in a power
, where p0 is the design (or average) momentum of beam
series of
π⊥
particles moving predominantly along the direction of the optic axis and
is the small transverse kinetic momentum. The leading order approxima-
tion along with
1, constitutes the paraxial or ideal behaviour and
higher order terms in the expansion give rise to the nonlinear or aberrating
behaviour. It is seen that the paraxial and aberrating behaviour get modiﬁed
by the quantum contributions which are in powers of the de Broglie wave-
length (–λ0 = ¯h/p0). The classical limit of the quantum formalism reproduces
the well known Lie algebraic formalism of charged-particle beam optics [49].

E.2 Light Optics: Various Prescriptions

The traditional scalar wave theory of optics (including aberrations to all or-
ders) is based on the beam-optical Hamiltonian derived by using Fermat’s
principle. This approach is purely geometrical and works adequately in
the scalar regime. The other approach is based on the square-root of the
Helmholtz operator, which is derived from the Maxwell equations [49]. This
approach works to all orders and the resulting expansion is no diﬀerent from
the one obtained using the geometrical approach of Fermat’s principle. As for
the polarization: a systematic procedure for the passage from scalar to vector
wave optics to handle paraxial beam propagation problems, completely tak-
ing into account the way in which the Maxwell equations couple the spatial
variation and polarization of light waves, has been formulated by analyzing
the basic Poincar´e invariance of the system, and this procedure has been
successfully used to clarify several issues in Maxwell optics [14]-[17].

In the above approaches, the beam-optics and the polarization are studied
separately, using very diﬀerent machineries. The derivation of the Helmholtz
equation from the Maxwell equations is an approximation as one neglects the
spatial and temporal derivatives of the permittivity and permeability of the
medium. Any prescription based on the Helmholtz equation is bound to be an
approximation, irrespective of how good it may be in certain situations. It is
very natural to look for a prescription based fully on the Maxwell equations,
which is sure to provide a deeper understanding of beam-optics and light
polarization in a uniﬁed manner.

The two-step algorithm used in the construction of the quantum theories
of charged-particle beam optics is very much applicable in light optics! But
there are some very signiﬁcant conceptual diﬀerences to be borne in mind.
When going beyond Fermat’s principle the whole of optics is completely
governed by the Maxwell equations, and there are no other equations, unlike
in quantum mechanics, where there are separate equations for, spin-1/2,
spin-1,

Maxwell’s equations are linear (in time and space derivatives) but cou-
pled in the ﬁelds. The decoupling leads to the Helmholtz equation which is
quadratic in derivatives. In the speciﬁc context of beam optics, purely from
a calculational point of view, the starting equations are the Helmholtz equa-
tion governing scalar optics and for a more accurate prescription one uses
the full set of Maxwell equations, leading to vector optics. In the context of

.
· · ·

50

the two-step algorithm, the Helmholtz equation and the Maxwell equations
in a matrix representation can be treated as the ‘basic’ equations, analogue
of the basic equations of quantum mechanics. This works perfectly ﬁne from
a calculational point of view in the scheme of the algorithm we have.

Exploiting the similarity between the Helmholtz wave equation and the
Klein-Gordon equation, the former is linearized using the Feshbach-Villars
procedure used for the linearization of the Klein-Gordon equation. Then the
Foldy-Wouthuysen iterative diagonalization technique is applied to obtain
a Hamiltonian description for a system with varying refractive index. This
technique is an alternative to the conventional method of series expansion of
the radical. Besides reproducing all the traditional quasiparaxial terms, this
method leads to additional terms, which are dependent on the wavelength,
in the optical Hamiltonian. This is the non-traditional prescription of scalar
optics.

×

The Maxwell equations can be cast into an exact matrix form taking into
account the spatial and temporal variations of the permittivity and perme-
8 matrices has a close algebraic
ability. The derived representation using 8
analogy with the Dirac equation, enabling the use of the rich machinery
of the Dirac electron theory. The beam optical Hamiltonian derived from
this representation reproduces the Hamiltonians obtained in the traditional
prescription along with wavelength-dependent matrix terms, which we have
named as the polarization terms. These polarization terms are very similar to
the spin terms in the Dirac electron theory and the spin-precession terms in
the beam-optical version of the Thomas-BMT equation [10]. The matrix for-
mulation provides a uniﬁed treatment of beam optics and light polarization.
Some well known results of light polarization are obtained as the paraxial
limit of the matrix formulation [14]-[17]. The traditional beam optics is com-
pletely obtained from our approach in the limit of small wavelength, –λ
0,
which we call as the traditional limit of our formalisms. This is analogous to
the classical limit obtained by taking ¯h
0, in the quantum prescriptions.
From the Hamiltonians in the Table we make the following observations:
The classical/traditional Hamiltonians of particle/light optics are modiﬁed
by wavelength-dependent contributions in the quantum/non-traditional pre-
scriptions respectively. The algebraic forms of these modiﬁcations in each
row is very similar. This should not come as a big surprise. The starting
equations have one-to-one algebraic correspondence: Helmholtz
Klein-
Dirac equation. Lastly, the de Broglie

0 and –λ
limit is obtained by taking –λ0 −→
0 respectively. The parallel
of the analogies between the two systems is sure to provide us with more
insights.

We present a theoretical study of the emission from a superluminal polarization current whose
distribution pattern rotates (with an angular frequency ω) and oscillates (with a frequency Ω) at the
same time, and which comprises both poloidal and toroidal components. This type of polarization
current is found in recent practical machines designed to investigate superluminal emission. We ﬁnd
that the superluminal motion of the distribution pattern of the emitting current generates localized
electromagnetic waves that do not decay spherically, i.e. that do not have an intensity diminishing
−2 with the distance RP from their source. The nonspherical decay of the focused wave
like RP
packets that are emitted by the polarization currents does not contravene conservation of energy:
the constructive interference of the constituent waves of such propagating caustics takes place within
diﬀerent solid angles on spheres of diﬀerent radii (RP ) centred on the source. For a polarization
current whose longitudinal distribution (over an azimuthal interval of length 2π) consists of m cycles
of a sinusoidal wave train, the nonspherically decaying part of the emitted radiation contains the
frequencies Ω ± mω; i.e. it contains only the frequencies involved in the creation and implementation
of the source. This is in contrast to recent studies of the spherically decaying emission, which was
shown to contain much higher frequencies. The polarization of the emitted radiation is found to be
linear for most conﬁgurations of the source.

INTRODUCTION

The electromagnetic ﬁeld of a moving charged particle whose speed exceeds the speed of light in vacuo is the subject
of several papers written by Sommerfeld in 1904 and 1905 [1], papers which were regarded to have been superseded by
special relativity soon after their publication. One reason for abandoning further investigations of the work initiated
by Sommerfeld, of course, was that any known particle that had a charge also had a rest mass and so was barred
from moving faster than light by the requirements of special relativity. But there was an additional reason. Not even
a massless particle can move faster than light in vacuo if it is charged; for if it does it would give rise to an inﬁnitely
strong electromagnetic ﬁeld on the envelope of the wave fronts that emanate from it.

It was not until the appearance of the works of Ginzburg and his coworkers [2, 3, 4] that it was realized that, though
no superluminal source of the electomagnetic ﬁeld can be point-like, there are no physical principles disallowing faster-
than-light sources that are extended. The coordinated motion of aggregates of subluminally moving charged particles
of opposite sign can give rise to macroscopic polarization currents whose distribution patterns move superluminally.
The electromagnetic ﬁeld that is generated by such extended sources, on the other hand, may be built up by the
superposition of the ﬁelds of their constituent volume elements, elements which individually act as the superluminally
moving point sources considered by Sommerfeld [5, 6, 7, 8].

The purpose of the present paper is to examine the radiation ﬁeld of a particular class of such volume-distributed
sources: polarization currents whose distribution patterns have the time dependence of a travelling wave with a
centripetally-accelerated superluminal motion. A motivation for this work is the recent design, construction and
testing of experimental machines with this characteristic [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].

The Green’s function for the problem we analyze is the familiar ﬁeld of a uniformly rotating point source. This is the
Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁeld that is encountered in the analysis of synchrotron radiation, except that here we do not restrict
the speed of the source to the subluminal regime. This uniformly rotating point source is used as a basic volume
element of the extended superluminal source, which is then treated in detail by superposing the Li´enard-Wiechert
ﬁelds of its constituent elements. We ﬁnd that fundamentally new radiation processes come into play as a result of
lifting the restriction to the subluminal regime, processes that have no counterparts in either the synchrotron or the
ˇCerenkov eﬀects.

This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents an introductory description of the principles behind our
It includes a deﬁnition of frequencies (Table I) and polarization (Section IIE) of the

calculation of the emission.

source, which are later used to discuss the spectral characteristics and polarization of the emitted radiation. A
detailed mathematical treatment is given in Section III, with the expression describing the nonspherically decaying
component of the radiation [Eq. (57)] being derived and discussed in Section IIID. The nonspherically and spherically
decaying components of the emission are compared in Section IV, and a summary is given in Section V.

II. PREAMBLE: FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

The physical principles underlying the (mostly unexpected) consequences of the processes described in Section I are
more transparent if we begin with a descriptive account of the building blocks of the (unavoidably lengthy) analysis
that follows in Section III. Consider a localized charge q (a charge with linear dimensions much smaller than the
typical radiation wavelengths considered) which moves on a circle of radius r with the constant angular velocity ωˆez,
i.e. whose path x(t) is given, in terms of the cylindrical polar coordinates (r, ϕ, z), by

r = const.,

z = const., ϕ = ˆϕ + ωt,

(1)

where ˆez is the basis vector associated with z, and ˆϕ the initial value of ϕ.

Having deﬁned the path of what will constitute the basic element of our volume source, we shall use the remainder
of this section to describe (A) the associated Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁeld, (B) the bifurcation surface which divides the
volume of the source into parts with diﬀereing inﬂuences on the ﬁeld, (C) the Hadamard regularization technique for
dealing with the singularities which are inevitably encountered in the ﬁelds from a superluminal source, (D) the focal
regions in which the nonspherically decaying part of the emission is detectable and (E) the relationship between the
polarization of the source and of the emission.

A. The Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁelds

The Li´enard-Wiechert electric and magnetic ﬁelds that arise from a superluminally moving charge q with the

trajectory described in Eq. (1) are given by

E(xP , tP ) = q

and B = ˆn×E. Here, the coordinates (xP , tP ) = (rP , ϕP , zP , tP ) mark the space-time of observation points,
dx/dt, c is the speed of light in vacuo, and R and ˆn are the magnitude

˙x ≡

and the direction ˆn ≡ R/R of the vector R(t) ≡ xP − x(t). The summation extends over all values of the retarded
time, i.e. all solutions tret < tP of h(t) ≡ t + R(t)/c = tP . This summation and the absolute-value signs in the factor
|1 − ˆn · ˙x/c|, which stems from the evaluation of the Dirac delta function δ(t − tP + R/c) in the classical expression for
the retarded potential [Eq. (10) below], are omitted in most textbook derivations of Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁelds because
in the subluminal regime the retarded time is a single-valued function of the observation time and 1 − ˆn · ˙x/c is
everywhere positive [15].

For a given point source (r, ˆϕ, z) with rω > c and various positions (rP , ϕP , zP ) of the observation point, the
dependence tP = h(t) of the reception time tP on the emission time t can have one of the generic forms shown in Fig.
1. As can be seen from curve (a) of this ﬁgure, there are values t± of the retarded time at which

1 − ˆn · ˙x/c = ˙h(t) = 1 − rP (rω/c) sin(ϕP − ϕ + ωt)/R(t) = 0,

i.e. at which the source approaches the observer with the speed of light along the radiation direction ˆn. The set of
observation points at which the ﬁeld receives contributions from the values t± of the retarded time are those located
on the envelope of the wave fronts emanating from the moving source in question (Fig. 2). In the vicinity of the
extrema of curve (a) in Fig. 1, the transcendental equation tP = h(t) for the retarded time reduces to

where tP ± ≡ h(t±) are the values of tP at which the waves emitted at t = t± arrive, and constructively interfere, at
the envelope of the wave fronts (see Appendix C of [5]).

FIG. 1: The relationship between the observation time tP and the emission time t for an observation point that lies (a) inside
or on, (b) on the cusp of, and (c) outside the envelope of the wave fronts or the bifurcation surface shown in Figs. 2 and 3. This
relationship is given by tP = t + R(t)/c ≡ h(t; r, ϕ, z; rP , ϕP , zP ), an equation that applies to the envelope when the position
(r, ϕ, z) of the source point is ﬁxed and to the bifurcation surface when the location (rP , ϕP , zP ) of the observer is ﬁxed. The
maxima and minima of curve (a), at which dR/dt = −c, occur on the sheets φ+ and φ− of the envelope or the bifurcation
surface, respectively (Figs. 2 and 3). The inﬂection points of curve (b), at which d2R/dt2 = 0, occur on the cusp curve of the
envelope or the bifurcation surface (Fig. 4).

Were it to exist, a superluminally rotating point source would therefore generate an inﬁnitely large ﬁeld on the
envelope of the wave fronts that would emanate from it: the Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁelds diverge at the extrema of curve
(a) in Fig. 1, where the factor 1 − ˆn · ˙x/c in the denominator of Eq. (2) vanishes. However, superluminal sources
are necessarily extended and so it is only a superposition of the Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁelds of their individual volume
elements that is physically meaningful. The relevant quantity is the integral of the above ﬁeld over the volume of
(r, ˆϕ, z) space that the moving localized source occupies in its rest frame.

B. The bifurcation surface of an observation point

Considering the ﬁeld of a given point source, we have so far kept (r, ˆϕ, z) ﬁxed and have varied (rP , ˆϕP , zP ). If
we now keep the observation point ﬁxed and allow the coordinates (r, ˆϕ, z) of the moving source point to sweep the
rest-frame volume of an extended source, then the curves in Fig. 1 would represent the forms the relationship tP = h(t)
assumes in diﬀerent regions of the (r, ˆϕ, z) space. For any given (rP , ˆϕP , zP ), there is a set of source elements of a
volume source which approach the observer along the radiation direction ˆn with the speed of light at the retarded
time, i.e. for which ˙h = 1 − ˆn · ˙x/c is zero. The locus of this set of source points in the (r, ˆϕ, z) space is given by the
intersection of the volume of the source with the two-sheeted surface tP ±(r, ˆϕ, z; rP , ϕP , zP ) − tP = 0, a surface that
we shall refer to as the bifurcation surface of the observation point P (Fig. 3). For all source points in the vicinity of
this locus, the relationship between the retarded and the observation times has the form assumed by curve (a) of Fig.
1 in the neighbourhood of its extrema, i.e. is that given in Eq. (5).

The two sheets (±) of the bifurcation surface tP ±(r, ˆϕ, z; rP , ϕP , zP ) − tP = 0 meet tangentially along a cusp curve
(Figs. 3 and 4). The source points on this cusp curve approach the observer not only with the wave speed (with
dR/dt = −c) but also with zero acceleration (d2R/dt2 = 0) along the radiation direction. For such source points,
the relationship between the retarded and the observation times has the form assumed by curve (b) of Fig. 1 in the
neighbourhood of its inﬂection point.

according to Eq. (5). The functions tP ± ≡ t± + R(t±)/c in Eq. (6) depend linearly on the coordinate ˆϕ of the source

FIG. 2: (a) Envelope of the spherical wave fronts emanating from a source point S which moves with a constant angular
velocity ω on a circle of radius r = 2.5c/ω (ˆr ≡ rω/c = 2.5). The circles in broken lines designate the orbit of S and the light
cylinder rP = c/ω (ˆrP = 1). The curves to which the emitted wave fronts are tangent are the cross sections of the two sheets
φ± of the envelope with the plane of source’s orbit. (b) Three-dimensional view of the light cylinder and the envelope of wave

point on the plane of the source’s orbit and spirals around the rotation axis out into the radiation zone. It approaches the cone

point. This can be seen from Eq. (4) without solving for t±: since t in Eq. (4) appears in only the combination
ϕP − ˆϕ − ωt, the solutions t± of this equation are given by expressions of the form t± = (ϕ± − ˆϕ)/ω in which ϕ± are
functions of (r, z) only. Given that the functions R(t±) also depend on t through ϕP − ˆϕ − ωt and so are independent
of ˆϕ, it follows from tP ± = t± + R(t±)/c that tP ± − tP has the functional form ( ˆϕ± − ˆϕ)/ω in which ˆϕ± depend on
r and z only.

According to Eqs. (2) and (6), therefore, the Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁelds diverge like | ˆϕ± − ˆϕ|− 3

2 for those source
elements close to the bifurcation surface ˆϕ = ˆϕ± which approach the observer with the speed of light at the retarded
time. This is a non-integrable singularity. To superpose the ﬁelds of the constituent volume elements of an extended
source we need to integrate the expression that appears on the right-hand side of Eq. (2) over the volume of the
(r, ˆϕ, z) space occupied by that source. The multiple integral that needs to be evaluated here entails an integral
with respect to ˆϕ whose integrand is proportional to | ˆϕ± − ˆϕ|− 3
2 in the vicinity of ˆϕ = ˆϕ± and so does not exist.
Non-integrable singularities of this type commonly arise in the solutions of the wave equation over odd-dimensional
space-times [16]; they can be handled by the following method from the theory of generalized functions, a method
originally devised by Hadamard [16, 17, 18].

C. Hadamard’s regularization technique

Hadamard’s regularization technique is applicable to situations in which the superposition of the potentials of the
volume elements of an extended source yields a diﬀerentiable function of the observer’s space-time coordinates, while
the superposition of the ﬁelds of those same elements results in a divergent integral. This technique enables one to
extract the physically relevant, ﬁnite value of the ﬁeld of the extended source in question (which would follow from
the diﬀerentiation of the potential owing to its entire volume) directly from the divergent integral that describes the
superposition of the singular ﬁelds of its constituent elements. The calculation and subsequent diﬀerentiation of the
potential owing to the entire source, a task which can hardly ever be performed analytically in physically realistic
situations of this kind, is thus rendered unnecessary.

In the present case, the singularity of the Li´enard-Wiechert potential is like |1 − ˆn · ˙x/c|−1 ∼ | ˆϕ± − ˆϕ|− 1

2 and so is
integrable. The diﬃculty referred to above would not arise if we superposed the potentials, instead of the ﬁelds, of
the consitituent volume elements of the source. We would know how to evaluate the required integral over (r, ˆϕ, z), at
least in principle, and the function of (xP , tP ) that we would thus obtain for the retarded potential of the entire source

5

FIG. 3: The bifurcation surface (i.e. the locus of source points that approach the observer along the radiation direction with
the speed of light at the retarded time) associated with the observation point P at the observation time tP (the motion of the
source is clockwise). The cusp Cb, along which the two sheets of the bifurcation surface meet, touches and is tangent to the
light cylinder (ˆr = 1) at a point on the plane passing through P normal to the rotation axis. This cusp curve is the locus
of source points which approach the observer not only with the speed of light (dR/dt = −c) but also with zero acceleration
(d2R/dt2 = 0) along the radiation direction. For an observation point in the radiation zone, the spiralling surface that issues
from P undergoes a large number of turns, in which its two sheets intersect one another, before reaching the light cylinder.

could then be diﬀerentiated to obtain a ﬁnite, singularity-free expression for the ﬁeld. The non-integrable singularity
we have encountered stems from interchanging the orders of integration and diﬀerentiation, from diﬀerentiating the
Li´enard-Wiechert potentials of the individual source elements (to obtain the ﬁelds) prior to integrating them over the
source volume. Though feasible in principle, it is not of course practical to calculate the retarded potential of any
physically viable extended source of the type we are considering explicitly. The regularization method we are about to
describe is such, however, that the ﬁnite value it would assign to the divergent integral we have encountered exactly
equals the value of the ﬁeld which would follow from directly diﬀerentiating the retarded potential of the extended
source [16, 17].

All the essential features of the mathematical problem that we face when atempting to integrate the Li´enard-
Wiechert ﬁeld (2) with respect to the source coordinate ˆϕ are illustrated by the following simple example. Consider the

The integral arising from the superposition of the Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁelds of the constituent volume elements of
a superluminally rotating charge distribution has an integrand which, in contrast to that of the integral in Eq. (8),
is singular within the domain of integration (rather than on the boundary of this domain). Although such cases are
seldom encountered in physics, their treatment using Hadamard’s regularization is well established in the theory of
[In the case of ˇCerenkov emission from an extended source, where
hyperbolic partial diﬀerential equations [16, 17].
there are no contributions from the source elements outside the bifurcation surface (the inverted ˇCerenkov cone issuing
from the observation point), the corresponding singularity occurs on the boundary of the domain of integration.] Here,
we have a divergent integral whose Hadamard ﬁnite part consists of two terms, an integrated term which turns out
to decay like RP
2 with the distance RP from the source as RP tends to inﬁnity, and an integral identical to the
classical expression for the retarded ﬁeld of a volume source [Eq. (14) of [19]] which decays spherically, like RP

−1.

D. The nonsphericallly decaying part of the emission

The nonspherically decaying component of the radiation is detectable only within a limited region of space and
during a limited interval of time: only when the cusps of the envelopes of wave fronts that emanate from the
superluminally moving volume elements of the source propagate past the observer (see Fig. 2).

The radiated ﬁeld entails, at any instant during this limited time interval, a set of wave envelopes (each associated
with the wave fronts emanating from a speciﬁc member of a corresponding set of source elements) whose cusps pass
through the position of the privileged observer in question. These caustics arise from those volume elements of the
source which approach the observer, along the radiation direction, with the speed of light and zero acceleration at
the retarded time (Figs. 3 and 4). It is the contribution toward the intensity of the ﬁeld from the ﬁlamentary locus
of such source elements that decays like RP

−1 instead of RP

−2.

The nonspherical decay of the ﬁeld does not contravene conservation of energy. The focused wave packets that
embody the nonspherically decaying pulses are constantly dispersed and reconstructed out of other waves, so that
the constructive interference of their constituent waves takes place within diﬀerent solid angles on spheres of diﬀerent
radii RP (see Appendix D of [5]). The integral of the ﬂux of energy across a large sphere centred on the source is
the same as the integral of the ﬂux of energy across any other sphere that encloses the source. The strong ﬁelds that
occur in focal regions are compensated by weaker ﬁelds elsewhere, so that the distribution of the ﬂux of energy across
such spheres is highly non-uniform and RP -dependent.

TABLE I: Deﬁnition of the various frequencies and numbers used to describe the source and the emitted radiation

E. Polarization of the source

This paper is speciﬁcally concerned with the spectral and polarization properties of the nonspherically decaying
component of the radiation from a superluminal source. To assist in identifying the origins of the various polarization
components in the emitted radiation, we base the analysis on a representative polarization current j = ∂P/∂t for
which

Pr,ϕ,z(r, ϕ, z, t) = sr,ϕ,z(r, z) cos(m ˆϕ) cos(Ωt),

−π < ˆϕ ≤ π,

with

ˆϕ ≡ ϕ − ωt,

where Pr,ϕ,z are the cylindrical components of the polarization (the electric dipole moment per unit volume), s(r, z)
is an arbitrary vector that vanishes outside a ﬁnite region of the (r, z) space and m is a positive integer. Equation (9)
generalizes the earlier calculation reported in [5], which was concerned with a rotating charge distribution, to a case
in which the emitting polarization current ﬂows in the r and z as well as in the ϕ direction and has a distribution
pattern that oscillates in addition to moving. This is similar to the polarization currents available within recently
constructed machines built to study the physics of superluminal emission (see [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] and Appendix A
of [19]).

Note that the ranges of values of both ϕ and t in Eq. (9) are inﬁnite, as in the case of a rotating point source, but
the Lagrangian coordinate ˆϕ, which labels each source element by its azimuthal position at t = 0, lies in an interval of
length 2π [19]. For a ﬁxed value of t, the azimuthal dependence of the density (9) along each circle of radius r within
the source is the same as that of a sinusoidal wave train, with the wavelength 2πr/m, whose m cycles ﬁt around
the circumference of the circle smoothly. As time elapses, this wave train both propagates around each circle with
the velocity rω and oscillates in its amplitude with the frequency Ω (Table I). The vector s is here left arbitrary in
order that we may investigate the polarization of the resulting radiation for all possible directions of the emitting
current (Table II). Note that one can construct any distribution with a uniformly rotating pattern, Pr,ϕ,z(r, ˆϕ, z), by
the superposition over m of terms of the form sr,ϕ,z(r, z, m) cos(m ˆϕ).

where δ is the Dirac delta function, R stands for the magnitude of R ≡ xP − x, and µ = 1, 2, 3 designate the

electromagnetic ﬁelds

E = −∇P A0 − ∂A/∂(ctP )

and

B = ∇P ×A

generated by the source in Eq. (9), the space-time of source points may be marked either with (x, t) = (r, ϕ, z, t) or
with the coordinates (r, ˆϕ, z, t) that naturally appear in the description of that rotating source. In fact, once ˆϕ is
adopted as the coordinate that ranges over (−π, π), the retarded position ϕ of the rotating source point (r, ˆϕ, z) as
well as the retarded time t could be used as the coordinate whose range is unlimited.

The electric current density j = ∂P/∂t that arises from the polarization distribution (9) is given, in terms of ϕ and

with ˆR ≡ Rω/c, ∆ϕ is the interval of azimuthal angle traversed by the source, and V is the volume occupied by the

Terms of the order of R−2 in ∇P ×A, which do not contribute toward the ﬂux of energy at inﬁnity, may be discarded,
as usual [15], if we are concerned only with the radiation ﬁeld. Since the problem we will be considering entails the
formation of caustics, however, we need to treat the arguments of the delta function and its derivative in the resulting
expression for B exactly. Approximating ∇P [R−1δ(t − tP + R/c)] by R−1δ′(t − tP + R/c)∇P (R/c), i.e. discarding the
term that arises from the diﬀerentiation of R−1, we can therefore write the magnetic ﬁeld of the radiation as

The corresponding expression for the electric ﬁeld is given by E ≃ ˆn×B, as in any other radiation problem.

The functions Gi(r, ˆϕ, z; rP , ˆϕP , zP , ϕP ) here act as Green’s functions: they describe the ﬁelds of uniformly rotating
point sources with ﬁxed (Lagrangian) coordinates (r, ˆϕ, z) whose strengths sinusoidally vary with time. In the special
case in which Ω = 0, i.e. the strength of the source is constant, G3 reduces to the Green’s function called G0 in [5]
and represents the Li´enard-Wiechert potential of the point source described in Eq. (1). This may be seen by noting
that the evaluation of the delta function in Eq. (22) yields

where ϕj are the solutions of the transcendental equation g(ϕ) = φ, solutions that are related to those of the equation
h(t) = t + R(t)/c = tP for the retarded times via ϕ = ˆϕ + ωt. The curves representing g(ϕ) versus ϕ have precisely
the same forms as those appearing in Fig. 1.

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

Similarly, the vector ∂(G2 cos θP ˆe⊥ +G1ˆek)/∂ ˆϕ is proportional to the Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁeld (2) when Ω is zero: the
electric current associated with the rotating point source from which ﬁeld (2) arises ﬂows in the azimuthal direction
and so corresponds to sr = sz = 0. The singularity structures of Gi are determined by the zeros of ∂g/∂ϕ or ˙h [see
Eq. (4)] and so are identical to the singularity structure already outlined in connection with G0 in [5].

B. Asymptotic expansion of the Green’s function in the time domain

The retarded times at which the value of the Green’s function (23) [or that of the Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁeld (2)]
receives divergent contributions from the point source (r, ˆϕ, z) are given by the following solutions of ∂g/∂ϕ = 0 [or,
equivalently, of Eq. (4)]:

ϕ± = ϕP + 2π − arccos[(1 ∓ ∆

2 )/(ˆrˆrP )],

in which (ˆr, ˆz; ˆrP , ˆzP ) stand for (rω/c, zω/c; rP ω/c, zP ω/c). Note that for a given observation point (rP , ϕP , zP , tP ),
the critical times t± = (ϕ± − ˆϕ)/ω exist (i.e. are real) only when the (r, z) coordinates of the source point lie within
the region ∆ ≥ 0 of the (r, z) space shown in Fig. 5.

The locus of source points in the (r, ˆϕ, z) space for which ∂g/∂ϕ = 0 can be found by inserting t± = (ϕ± − ˆϕ)/ω in
the equation tP − t − R/c = 0 which speciﬁes the retarded times, or equivalently by inserting Eq. (24) in g − φ = 0
[see Eqs. (10), (13) and (15)]. The result is

φ = φ± ≡ g(ϕ±) = 2π − arccos[(1 ∓ ∆

The two sheets (±) of the tube-like spiralling surface ˆϕ = ˆϕP + φ±(r, z) meet tangentially and form a cusp where

FIG. 5: The projection ∆ = 0 of the cusp curve of the bifurcation surface onto (r, z) space. The two sheets φ±(r, z) of the
bifurcation surface exist only for the values of (r, z) in ∆ ≥ 0. For a given (r, z) in ∆ ≥ 0, the source point (r, ˆϕ, z) lies within
the bifurcation surface for φ− < ˆϕ − ˆϕP < φ+ and outside this surface for other values of ˆϕ. The source elements whose (r, z)
coordinates fall in ∆ < 0 approach the observer with a speed dR/dt < c at the retarded time and so make contributions toward
the ﬁeld that are no diﬀerent from those made in the subluminal regime. The projection of the cusp curve of the envelope
of wave fronts onto the (rP , zP ) space is also given by ∆ = 0 and has the same shape: the function ∆ is invariant under the
transformation (r, z; rP , zP ) → (rP , zP ; r, z). That the cusp curve of the envelope approaches the cone θP = arcsin(1/ˆr) as RP
tends to inﬁnity can be seen here from the slopes of the asymptotes of the curve ∆ = 0: these asymptotes, and so the segments
ˆz > ˆzP and ˆz < ˆzP of the cusp curve, lie in the plane ˆz = ˆzP for ˆr = 1+ but open up and tend towards the vertical as ˆr
becomes increasingly greater than 1.

locus of source points which approach the observer, not only with the speed of light, but also with zero acceleration
along the radiation direction. On it, the coalescence of two neighbouring stationary points of the phase function
[curve (a) of Fig. 1] results in a point of inﬂection [curve (b) of Fig. 1] and so in a stronger singularity of the Green’s
function.

For source points in the vicinity of this cusp curve, a unifrom asymptotic approximation to the value of the integral
(22) deﬁning the Gi can be found by the method of Chester, Friedman and Ursell [20, 21]. Where it is analytic (i.e.
for all x 6= xP ), the function g(ϕ) in the argument of the delta function in Eq. (22) may be transformed into the
following cubic function:

3 ν3 − c1
where ν is a new variable of integration replacing ϕ, and the coeﬃcients c1 and c2 are chosen such that the values of
the two functions on opposite sides of Eq. (28) coincide at their extrema:

2ν + c2,

g(ϕ) = 1

expressions for the coeﬃcients pj(r, z) and qj(r, z) are given in Appendix A.

The above results show that as a source point (r, ˆϕ, z) in the vicinity of the cusp curve approaches the bifurcation

Moreover, like the diﬀraction ﬁeld near a focal point [22], the Green’s function Gj

out across the strip bordering on the cusp curve
in Eq. (34c) results in a ﬁnite discontinuity in the value of Gj
where the two sheets of the bifurcation surface are tangential: even in the limit c1 → 0, where φ− and φ+ are
3 qj/c1. It is this discontinuity in the value of the
coincident, Gj
Green’s function (the potential of a point source) across the cusp curve of the bifurcation surface that gives rise to
nonspherically decaying boundary contributions to the ﬁeld of a volume source. (Note that a discontinuity of this
type, which resembles that of a step function, cannot be handled by means of an analysis in the frequency domain
unless the contributions from an inﬁnitely large number of Fourier components of the decomposed Green’s function
are accurately superposed again when evaluating the ﬁeld.)

C. Hadamard’s ﬁnite part of the integral representing the radiation ﬁeld

The integral which represents the superposition of the contributions of the source elements in the vicinity of the
cusp curve of the bifurcation surface to the value of the magnetic ﬁeld, i.e. the integral resulting from the insertion
of Eq. (34) in Eq. (20), is divergent: the derivative ∂Gj/∂ ˆϕ of the Green’s function has a singularity [∼ (1 − χ2)− 3
2 ]
that is not integrable (with respect to χ or equivalently ˆϕ).

Our task in this section is to extract the Hadamard ﬁnite part [16, 17] of this divergent integral, the ﬁnite quantity
that we would have obtained had we been able to evaluate the potential A(xP , tP ) of the entire source explicitly prior
to applying the operator ∇P × to this potential.

The function ∂Gj/∂ ˆϕ appearing under the integral sign in Eq. (20) is given by diﬀerent expressions in diﬀerent
regions of (r, ˆϕ, z) space [see Eq. (34)]. For an observation point, the cusp curve of whose bifurcation surface intersects
the source distribution, therefore, the domain of integration in Eq. (20) has to be divided into a part Vin that lies
within and a part Vout that lies without the bifurcation surface before the integrand of the integral in this equation
can be written out explicitly (Fig. 3). The Green’s function Gj has no singularities in the region ∆ < 0 of the (r, z)
space (Fig. 5), so that the contribution of the source elements in the part of Vout for which ∆ < 0 are no diﬀerent

in diverges on the inner sides, χ = 1− and χ = −1+, of the two sheets φ+ and φ− of the bifurcation surface. The function
G1
out is discontinuous across a two-dimensional strip bordering on the cusp curve of the bifurcation surface: even at points
G1
close to this cusp curve where the separation φ+ − φ− of the two sheets of the bifurcation surface tends to zero (Figs. 3 and
4), the vanishingly small interval φ− < φ < φ+ in φ is mapped into the ﬁnite interval −1 < χ < 1 in χ, so that the diﬀerence
out on opposite sides of the strip in question remains non-zero.

from the contributions of the source elements that lie in the subluminally moving portion of the source [see Eqs.
(23)–(25)]. It would be suﬃcient to consider the contributions only of those source elements for which ∆ ≥ 0. All
source elements for which ∂Gj/∂ ˆϕ is singular are taken into account once the integration with respect to ˆϕ (at ﬁxed
values of r and z in ∆ ≥ 0) is performed over the following two intervals: the interval φ− < ˆϕ − ˆϕP < φ+ in which

Thus the magnetic ﬁeld B∆≥0 that arises from the source elements in ∆ ≥ 0 can be written, according to Eq. (20),

The integrand of the surface integral in Eq. (47) is still singular on the projection of the cusp curve of the bifurcation
surface onto the (r, z) space (Fig. 5) but this singularity is integrable.

D. Amplitude, frequencies and polarization of the nonspherically decaying radiation outside the plane of
source’s orbit

The leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the integral in Eq. (47) for high µ± (i.e. for the regime in which
the wavelengths of oscillations of the source are much shorter than the length scale c/ω of its orbit) may be obtained
by the method of stationary phase provided that θP 6= π/2.

Both derivatives, ∂φ−/∂ˆr and ∂φ−/∂ ˆz, of the function that appears in the phase of the rapidly oscillating expo-
nential in Eq. (47) vanish at the point ˆr = 1, ˆz = ˆzP , where the cusp curve of the bifurcation surface touches, and
is tangential to, the light cylinder (see Figs. 3 and 4). However, ∂2φ−/∂ˆr2 diverges at this point, so that neither the
phase nor the amplitude of the integrand of the integral in Eq. (47) are analytic at ˆr = 1, ˆz = ˆzP . Only for an observer
who is located outside the plane of rotation, i.e. whose coordinate zP does not match the coordinate z of any source
element, is the function φ− analytic throughout the domain of integration. To take advantage of the simpliﬁcations
oﬀered by the analyticity of φ− as a function of ˆr, we proceed under the assumption that θP 6= π/2.

plane (see also [19]). In the far-ﬁeld limit, where the terms (ˆz − ˆzP )2/(ˆr2
P − 1)2 and ˆrC /ˆrP in Eq. (48) are much
smaller than unity, curve C coincides with the locus

of source points which approach the observer along the radiation direction with the wave speed and zero acceleration
at the retarded time, i.e. coincides with the cusp curve of the bifurcation surface (Figs. 3 and 4).

It can be seen from the far-ﬁeld limit of Eq. (49) that the cusp curve Cb would intersect the source distribution
if θP lies in the interval |θP − π
2 | ≤ arccos (1/ˆr>), where ˆr> ≡ r>ω/c and r> is the radial coordinate of the outer
boundary of the source [5]. Hence, the range of values of θP for which the stationary points of φ− fall within the
source distribution would be as wide as (0, π) if the extent r> − c/ω of the superlumially moving part of the source
is comparable to the radius c/ω of the light cylinder (see Fig. 5).

The dominant terms in the Taylor expansion of φ− about a point (ˆrC , ϕC , ˆz) on curve C (with an arbitrary

coordinate ˆz 6= ˆzP ) are

in which we have denoted the values of φ and ˆR on C by φC ≡ ˆRC + ϕC − ϕP and

We are now in a position to evaluate the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the ˆr integral in Eq. (47)
by applying the principle of stationary phase [23, 24]: by replacing the phase of the rapidly oscillating exponential
that appears in this integral with its Taylor expansion (50) and approximating the amplitude of the integrand with
its value along C. The resulting integral, at a given value of ˆz, is

for the electric ﬁeld (Ens ∼ ˆn×Bns) of the nonspherically decaying part of the radiation. This expression is valid,
of course, only for an observation point, outside the plane of rotation, the cusp curve of whose bifurcation surface
intersects the source distribution, i.e. for 0 < |θP − π

2 | ≤ arccos (1/ˆr>).

Thus the spectrum of the nonspherically decaying part of the radiation only contains the frequencies µ±ω = Ω±mω,
i.e. the frequencies that enter the creation or practical implementation of the source described in Eq. (9). This contrasts
with the spectrum of the spherically spreading part of the radiation which extends to frequencies of the order of Ω3/ω2
[19]). The intensity of the radiation at the frequency Ω + mω is the same as its intensity at
when Ω/ω ≫ 1 (cf.
Ω − mω when either Ω/ω ≫ m or Ω/ω ≪ m. The radiation at one of these frequencies would have a much lower
intensity, on the other hand, if Ω and mω are comparable in magnitude.

Equation (57) shows, moreover, that the nonspherically decaying component of the radiation is linearly polarized
both for Ω/ω ≪ 1 and for Ω/ω ≫ 1 when one of the cylindrical components of ¯s is appreciably larger than the others.
In the case of an s which lies in the azimuthal direction, the radiation is polarized parallel to the plane of rotation
for Ω/ω ≪ 1 and normal to that direction (and phase shifted by π/2) for Ω/ω ≫ 1. The plane of polarization of the
radiation coincides with the plane passing through the observer and the rotation axis if s lies parallel to the rotation
axis. For this radiation to be elliptically polarized, on the other hand, ¯s needs to have two cylindrical components
that are comparable in magnitude and Ω/ω has to be of the order of unity (Table II).

IV. DISCUSSION: COMPARISON OF THE NONSPHERICALLY AND SPHERICALLY DECAYING
COMPONENTS OF THE RADIATION

The radiation ﬁeld that arises from the superluminal portion (r > c/ω) of the volume source described in Eq. (9)
consists, as shown in the preceding section, of two components: a nonspherically decaying component whose intensity

−1 with the distance RP from the source and a spherically spreading component, one whose intensity
diminishes like RP
−2 on RP . The former is described by Eq. (57) and the latter, which follows from
has the conventional dependence RP
Eq. (40), was earlier calculated in [19]. The nonspherically decaying part of the radiation Ens is only emitted at the
two frequencies µ±ω, whereas the spherically decaying part Es has a discrete spectrum, comprising multiples nω of
the rotation frequency, which extends as far as n ∼ (Ω/ω)3 when Ω/ω (≫ 1) is diﬀerent from an integer (see Table I).
As in the case of any other linear system, the present emission process generates an output only at those frequencies
which are carried both by its input (the source) and its response (Green’s) function. The agent responsible for the
generation of a broadband radiation from the source described in Eq. (9), whose creation or practical implementation
only entails the two frequencies µ±ω, is acceleration: a remarkable eﬀect of centripetal acceleration is to enrich the
spectral content of a rotating volume source, for which Ω/ω is diﬀerent from an integer, by eﬀectively endowing the
distribution of its density with space-time discontinuities. (For a detailed discussion of this point, see [19].)

The electric ﬁeld of the spherically spreading part of the radiation for incommensurate values of Ω and ω is given

which m and Ω are everywhere replaced by −m and −Ω, respectively, and Jn−Ω/ω(n) and J′
n−Ω/ω(n) are the Anger
function [25] and the derivative of the Anger function with respect to its argument.

To compare the amplitudes of Ens and Es at a frequency with which both these components are emitted, let us
consider a case in which Ω/ω equals an integer, so that the spherically decaying part of the radiation is also emitted
only at the frequencies µ±ω. In this case, the quantity Q ˆϕ in Eq. (60) is non-zero only if n equals µ+ or µ−, and
Q ˆϕ|n=µ± = −πµ±

V. SUMMARY

We have examined the electromagnetic emission from polarization charge-currents whose distribution patterns have
the time dependence of a travelling wave with an accelerated superluminal motion. Such macroscopic polarization
currents are not incompatible with the requirements of special relativity because their superluminally moving distri-
bution patterns are created by the coordinated motion of aggregates of subluminally moving particles. Our analysis
is based on an emitting polarization current, which has a poloidal as well as a toroidal component, and which has a
distribution pattern that sinusoidally oscillates in addition to superluminally rotating (Table I); similar currents are
employed in recently-constructed machines designed to test the physics of superluminal emission.

We ﬁnd that such sources generate localized electromagnetic waves that do not decay spherically, i.e. that do not
−2 with the distance RP from their source [Eq. (57)]. The nonspherical decay of
have an intensity diminishing like RP
the focused wave packets that are emitted does not contravene conservation of energy (Section IID): the constructive
interference of the constituent waves of such propagating caustics takes place within diﬀerent solid angles on spheres
of diﬀerent radii (RP ) centred on the source.

Detailed analysis in the far-ﬁeld limit shows that the spectrum of the nonspherically decaying part of the radiation
emitted by the source described in Eq. (9) only contains the frequencies Ω ± mω, i.e. the frequencies that enter the
creation or practical implementation of that source (Section IIID and Table I). This contrasts with the spectrum of
the spherically spreading part of the radiation which extends to higher frequencies (Section IV).

We have also determined the polarization of the nonspherically decaying component of the radiation in the far-ﬁeld
limit. In many cases, the emission is highly linearly polarized [Eq. (57) and Table II]; however, with certain source
frequencies and polarizations it is possible to also produce elliptical polarized emission.

Finally, we have examined the relative amplitudes of the spherically and nonspherically decaying components of
the emission. We ﬁnd that even at relatively short distances from the emitter, the latter component can represent
the greater part of the observed signal.

Appendix: evaluation of the leading terms in the asymptotic expansion of the Green’s function

This appendix concerns the evaluation of the coeﬃcients pj(r, z) and qj(r, z) in the asymptotic expansion (34) of
the Green’s function Gj for small c1. These coeﬃcients are deﬁned, by Eqs. (31) and (33), in terms of the functions
ϕ±, ˆR± and c1, which appear in Eqs. (24)–(27) and (29), and the derivative dϕ/dν which is to be calculated from
Eq. (28).

We have already seen in Section IIIC that close to the cusp curve of the bifurcation surface (where ∆ = 0) the
function c1(r, z) can be approximated as in Eq. (45). In the regime of validity of the asymptotic expansion (34), where
2 , the functions ϕ± and ˆR± may likewise be expressed in terms of (ˆr, ∆) [instead
∆ is much smaller than (ˆr2 ˆr2
of (ˆr, ˆz)] and expanded in powers of ∆

where ϕc ≡ ϕP + 2π − arccos[1/(ˆrˆrP )]. Recall that ν = ±c1 in Eq. (33) are the images under the mapping (28) of
ϕ = ϕ∓, respectively.

The remaining functions dϕ/dν|ν=±c1 that appear in the deﬁnitions of pj and qj are indeterminate. Their corre-

sponding values have to be found by repeated diﬀerentiation of Eq. (28) with respect to ν:

etc., and the evaluation of the resulting relations at ν = ±c1. This procedure, which amounts to applying the
l’Hˆopital’s rule, yields

for the values of the ﬁrst two derivatives of ϕ. Close to the cusp curve ∆ = 0, where c1 and ˆR± may be approximated

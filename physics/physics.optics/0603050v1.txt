ABSTRACT

Quasiclassical approach and geometric optics allow to describe rather accurately whispering gallery modes in
convex axisymmetric bodies. Using this approach we obtain practical formulas for the calculation of eigenfre-
quencies and radiative Q-factors in dielectrical spheroid and compare them with the known solutions for the
particular cases and with numerical calculations. We show how geometrical interpretation allows expansion of
the method on arbitrary shaped axisymmetric bodies.

Keywords: Whispering gallery modes, microspheres, eikonal

1. INTRODUCTION

Submillimeter size optical microspheres made of fused silica with whispering gallery modes (WGM)1 can have
extremely high quality-factor, up to 1010 that makes them promising devices for applications in optoelectronics
and experimental physics. Historically Richtmyer2 was the ﬁrst to suggest that whispering gallery modes in
axisymmetric dielectric body should have very high quality-factor. He examined the cases of sphere and torus.
However only recent breakthroughs in technology in several labs allowed producing not only spherical and
not only fused silica but spheroidal, toroidal3, 4 or even arbitrary form axisymmetrical optical microcavities
from crystalline materials preserving or even increasing high quality factor.5 Especially interesting are devices
manufactured of nonlinear optical crystals. Microresonators of this type can be used as high-ﬁnesse cavities for
laser stabilization, as frequency discriminators and high-sensitive displacement sensors, as sensors of ambient
medium and in optoelectronical RF high-stable oscillators.
(See for example materials of the special LEOS
workshop on WGM microresonators6).

The theory of WGMs in microspheres is well established and allows precise calculation of eigenmodes, radiative
losses and ﬁeld distribution both analytically and numerically. Unfortunately, the situation changes drastically
even in the case of simplest axisymmetrical geometry, diﬀerent from ideal sphere or cylinder. No closed analytical
solution can be found in this case. Direct numerical methods like ﬁnite elements method are also ineﬃcient
when the size of a cavity is several orders larger than the wavelength. The theory of quasiclassical methods of
eigenfrequencies approximation starting from pioneering paper by Keller and Rubinow have made a great progress
lately.8 For the practical evaluation of precision that these methods can in principal provide, we chose a practical
problem of calculation of eigenfrequencies in dielectric spheroid and found a series over angular mode number
l. This choice of geometry is convenient due to several reasons: 1) other shapes, for example toroids4 may be
approximated by equivalent spheroids; 2) the eikonal equation as well as scalar Helmholtz equation (but not the
vector one!) is separable in spheroidal coordinates that gives additional ﬂexibility in understanding quasiclassical
methods and comparing them with other approximations; 3) in the limit of zero eccentricity spheroid turns to
sphere for which exact solution and series over l up to l−8/3 is known.9

The Helmholtz vector equation is unseparable10 in spheroidal coordinates and no vector harmonics tangential
to the surface of spheroid can be build. That is why there are no pure TE or TM modes in spheroids but only
hybrid ones. Diﬀerent methods of separation of variables (SVM) using series expansions with either spheroidal
or spherical functions have been proposed.11–13 Unfortunately they lead to extremely bulky inﬁnite sets of
equations which can be solved numerically only in simplest cases and the convergence is not proved. Exact
characteristic equation for the eigenfrequencies in dielectric spheroid was suggested14 without provement that if
real could signiﬁcantly ease the task of ﬁnding eigenfrequencies. However, we can not conﬁrm this claim as this
characteristic equation contradicts limiting cases with the known solutions i.e. ideal sphere and axisymmetrical
oscillations in a spheroid with perfectly conducting walls.15

Nevertheless, in case of whispering gallery modes adjacent to equatorial plane the energy is mostly concen-
trated in tangential or normal to the surface electric components that can be treated as quasi-TE or quasi-TM
modes and analyzed with good approximation using scalar wave equations.

Using quasiclassical method we deduce below the following practical approximation for the eigenfrequencies

of whispering gallery modes in spheroid:

2. SPHEROIDAL COORDINATE SYSTEM

There are several equivalent ways to introduce prolate and oblate spheroidal coordinates and corresponding
eigenfunctions.16–18 The following widely used system of coordinates allows to analyze prolate and oblate
geometries simultaneously:

spherical Bessel function jl(kr) if d/2

m(η) with λm,l = l(l + 1). That is why spheroidal functions are
frequently analyzed as decomposition over these spherical functions.

→

The calculation of spheroidal functions and of λml is not a trivial task.19, 20 The approximation of spheroidal
functions and their zeros may seem more straightforward for the calculation of eigenfrequencies of spheroids,
however we found that another approach that we develop below gives better results and may be easily generalized
to other geometries.

3. EIKONAL APPROXIMATION IN SPHEROID

The eikonal approximation is a powerful method for solving optical problems in inhomogeneous media where
the scale of the variations is much larger than the wavelength. It was shown by Keller and Rubinow7 that it
can also be applied to eigenfrequency problems and that it has very clear quasiclassical ray interpretation. It
is important that this quasiclassical ray interpretation requiring simple calculation of the ray paths along the
geodesic surfaces and application of phase equality (quantum) conditions gives precisely the same equations as
the eikonal equations. Eikonal equations allow, however, to obtain more easily not only eigenfrequencies but
ﬁeld distribution also.

In the eikonal approximation the solution of the Helmholtz scalar equation is found as a superposition of

straight rays:

The ﬁrst order approximation for the phase function S called eikonal is determined by the following equation.

u(r) = A(r)eık0S(r).

S)2 = ǫ(r),

(
∇

where ǫ is optical susceptibility. For our problem of searching for eigenfrequencies ǫ does not depend on coor-
dinates, ǫ = n2 inside the cavity and ǫ = 1 – outside. Though the eikonal can be found as complex rays in the
external area and stitched on the boundary as well as ray method of Keller and Rubinow7, 8, 21 can be extended
for whispering gallery modes in dielectrical bodies in a more simple way.22 To do so we must account for an
additional phase shift on the dielectric boundary. Fresnel amplitude coeﬃcient of reﬂection23:

Nevertheless, direct use of this phase shift in the equations for internal rays as suggested in22 leads to incorrect
results. The reason is a well known Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect – the shift of the reﬂected beam along the surface. The

That is why we may substitute the problem for a dielectric body with the problem for an equivalent body
enlarged on σr with the totally reﬂecting boundaries. The parameters of equivalent spheroid are marked below
with overbars.

whispering gallery modes. The eikonal equation describes rays spreading inside a cavity along straight lines and
reﬂecting from boundaries. For the whispering gallery modes the angle of reﬂection is close to π/2. The envelope
of these rays forms a caustic surface which in case of spheroid is also a spheroid determined by a parameter
ξc. The rays are the tangents to this internal caustic spheroid and follow along eodesic lines on it. In case of
ideal sphere all the rays of the same family lie in the same plane. However, even a slightest eccentricity removes
this degeneracy and inclined closed circular modes which should be more accurately called quasimodes24 are
turned into open-ended helices winding up on caustic spheroid precessing,25 and ﬁlling up the whole region as
in a clew. The upper and lower points of these trajectories determine another caustic surface with a parameter
ηc determining two-sheeted hyperboloid for prolate or one-sheeted hyperboloid for oblate spheroid. The value
of ηc has very simple mechanical interpretation. The rays in the eikonal approximation are equivalent to the
trajectories of a point-like billiard ball inside the cavity. As axisymmetrical surface can not change the angular
ρ2 ˙φ = const, ρ2 = x2 +y2) as well as the
momentum related to the z axis, it should be conserved on the ray (Lz ≡
kinetic energy (velocity). That is why ηc is simply equal to the sine of the angle between the equatorial plane and
the trajectory crossing the equator and at the same time it determines the maximum elongation of the trajectory

2~σ(~σ ˙ri), where ~σ is the outward
normal to the surface unit vector. The so-called billiard theory in 2D and 3D is extremely popular these days
in deterministic chaos studies. This theory describes for example ray dynamics and Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser
(KAM) transition to chaos in 2D deformed stadium-like optical cavities and in 3D strongly deformed droplets.31
In this paper, however, we are interested only in stable whispering gallery modes which are close to the surface
and equatorial plane of axisymmetric convex bodies. Axisymmetric 3D billiard is equivalent to 2D billiard in (ρ,
z) coordinates. In these coordinates 3D linear rays transform into parabolas and a ball behaves as if centrifugal
force acts on it.30 Fig 2 shows how segments of geometric rays (turned into segments of parabolas) ﬁll the
volume between caustic lines in a spheroid with b/a = 0.6. If all the rays touch the caustic or boundary surface
with phases that form stationary distribution (that means that the phase diﬀerence along any closed curve on
them is equal to integer times 2π), then the eigenfunction and hence eigenfrequency is found.

To ﬁnd the circular integrals of phases kS (13) we should take into account the properties of phase evolutions
on caustic and reﬂective boundary. Every touching of caustic adds π/2 (see for example8) and reﬂection adds
π. Thus for S1 we have one caustic shift of π/2 at ξc and one reﬂection from the equivalent boundary surface ξs
(at the distance σ from the real surface), for S2 – two times π/2 due to caustic shifts at
ηc, and we should add

along ηc to the boundary surface ξs, reﬂects from it, and returns back to the same circle. The second is simply
the arc of the circle between P1 and P2 (Fig.3). The integral for S2 corresponds to the length of a geodesic

ηc and returning to ηc at P2 minus the length of the arc of the circle

Figure 6. Comparison of the precision of calculation of eigenfrequencies in spheroid for T E100,100,1 mode.

The ﬁrst three terms for nka were obtained in3, 26–28 from diﬀerent considerations, the last three are new.

To test this series we calculated using ﬁnite element method (FEM) eigenfrequencies of TE modes in spheroids
with diﬀerent eccentricities with totally reﬂecting boundaries for l = m = 100 (Fig.6). Signiﬁcant improvement
of our series is evident. The divergence of the series for large eccenricities is explained by the fact that the
approximation that we used to calculate the integrals (15) but not the method itself breaks down in this case.
Namely ηc becomes comparable to ξ and should not be treated as a small parameter. If we put a = b, then all six
terms in the obtained series coincide with that obtained in9 from exact solution in sphere with a diﬀerence that
Airy function zeros αq ≃
(2.3381, 4.0879, 5.5206, ...) stand in Schiller’s series instead of approximate βq values
0.017; 0.0061; 0.0033, ...). The reason is that the eikonal approximation breaks down on caustic,
(αq −
where its more accurate extension with Airy functions is ﬁnite.7 To make our solution even better we may
just formally use αq instead of βq, hence obtaining ﬁnal formula (1). The eikonal equation for the sphere may
be solved explicitly and the expansion of the solution shows that quasiclassical approximation breaks down on
a term O(l−1), and of the same order should be the error introduced by substitution of vector equations by a
scalar ones.

It is interesting to note that when a = 2b (oblate spheroid with the eccentricity ε = √0.75, the eigenfrequency
separation in the ﬁrst order of approximation between modes with the same l becomes equal to the separation
m (free spectral range). The diﬀerence appears only in the
between modes with diﬀerent l and the same l
term proportional to O(l−2/3). This situation is close to the case that was experimentally observed in.3 This
new degeneracy has simple quasigeometrical interpretation – like in case of a sphere geodesic lines inclined to
the equator plane on such spheroid are closed curves returning at the same point of the equator after the whole
revolution, crossing, however, the equator not twice as big circles on a sphere but four times.

4. ARBITRARY CONVEX BODY OF REVOLUTION

To ﬁnd eigenfrequencies of whispering gallery modes in arbitrary body of revolution one may use directly the
results of the previous section by ﬁtting the shape of the body in convex equatorial area by equivalent spheroid.
In fact the body should be convex only in the vicinity of WG mode itself. For example a torus with a width 2RT
and a height rT may be approximated by a spheroid with a = RT and b = √RT rT . Nevertheless, more rigorous
approach may be developed.

The ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd families of caustic surfaces. This is not a trivial task in general nonintegrable case.
The following approximation may be used to ﬁnd the ﬁrst family of caustic surfaces8 which are the place of
biinvolute curves for characteristic for a chosen WGM mode geodesic lines on the surface:

(s),

(s) + O(κ4)

where σc(s) is the normal distance from a point s on the surface of the body to a caustic surface, κ is a parameter
of a family, and rk is the radius of curvature of the geodesic line (curvature of the surface in the direction of the
beam) and cos θ is angle of incidence of the beam in the point s.

If we found a caustic surface from the ﬁrst family, parametrized as ρ = g(z) then we can ﬁnd also the second

family parametrized as h(z) orthogonal to any surface of the ﬁrst family with diﬀerent κ.

A geodesic line for the surface is given by the following integral:

where ρc = g(zm) is the radius of caustic circle at maximum distance from equatorial plane. The length of

5. QUALITY-FACTOR

As it was shown above, WGMs in axially symmetric bodies, parametrizes as ρ(z) are eﬃciently described by
optical beam traveling close to surface geodesic line and suﬀering multiple reﬂections from a curved surface. If
we want to calculate Q-factor of whispering gallery mode associated with surface reﬂection using quasiclassical
approach we should take into account losses added at every reﬂection. The quality factor is determined by the
following simple equation1:

Q =

2πn
αλ

,

where α denotes losses per unit path length. If the path is comprised of segments of polyline, then the length of
each segment is Ln = 2rk cos θ, where rk is the radius of curvature of the geodesic line on the surface. Let power
losses due to reﬂection in this segment is equal to T (θ) and hence αn = T (θ, rk)/Ln. To account for total losses
we should average αn over one coil of geodesic line and hence we ﬁnally obtain:

Q =

This very useful expression can be used to calculate Q-factors in arbitrary shaped whispering gallery res-
onators associated not only with radiative but also with surface scattering and absorption. The required co-
eﬃcient T (θ) may be deduced from the solution of model problem in a sphere, where rk = a and cos θ0 =

(l + 1/2)2/(kna)2

√αq(l/2)−1/3 are constants:

Radiative losses per single reﬂection may be also calculated using quasiclassical arguments.29 If a beam of light
is internally reﬂected from a curved dielectric surface with radius of curvature rk, then in the external region
evanescent ﬁeld exponentially decays as e−krn√n2 sin2 θ−1, here rn is normal distance from the surface, however
at a distance rn = rk(n sin θ
1) tangential phase velocity reaches speed of light and the tail of evanescent ﬁeld
is radiated. These speculations allow to obtain quasiclassical estimate:

From the above equations one can calculate the Q-factor knowing T (θ) and using the following expressions:

where ρm = ρ(zm) is a distance from the z-axis of the highest point of geodesic line, σc is the normal distance
between surface and caustic surface.

For radiative losses, however, only T (θ) having exponential term essentially variates along the geodesic line

with cos θ maximal and ρk minimal at z = 0 for oblate geometry and vice versa for prolate one.

Now we can calculate the radiative quality factor of WGMs in a spheroid.

In conclusion. We have analyzed quasiclassical method of calculation of eigenfrequencies and quality factors

in dielectrica cavities and found that for spheroid they give rather precise results.

Abstract

We extend the quantum theory of dissipation in the context of system-reservoir model,

where the reservoir in question is kept in a nonequilibrium condition. Based on a system-

atic separation of time scales involved in the dynamics, appropriate generalizations of the

ﬂuctuation- dissipation and Einstein’s relations have been pointed out. We show that the

Wigner-Weisskopf decay of the system mode results in a rate constant which depending on

the relaxation of nonequilibrium bath is dynamically modiﬁed. We also calculate the time-

dependent spectra of a cavity mode with a suitable gain when the cavity is kept in contact

with a nonequilibrium bath.

I. INTRODUCTION

The problem of dissipative dynamics in quantum system is a key issue in physics and chemistry

today. The system-reservoir model describing the evolution of the quantum system coupled to

a much larger system regarded as a reservoir has been the standard paradigm for dissipation

in classical and quantum systems for many years [1-3]. A popular variant of this model is the

spin-boson model, a magnetic dipole coupled to a Boson ﬁeld; another is a two-level atom in

contact with a continuum of radiation ﬁeld modes. These models describe a large variety of

physical situations, such as, spontaneous emission, polaron formations, exiton motion, macroscopic

quantum tunneling etc., in atomic physics, solid state physics and quantum optics.

In general, two very distinct situations emerge depending on the strength of the coupling

constant between the system and the reservoir. In the weak coupling case, the behavior of the

former is only slightly aﬀected by the reservoir which essentially behaves as a free ﬁeld.

In

the strong coupling cases (as in polaron theories) the polarization of the reservoir ﬁeld by the

system can not be ignored. The second important approximation that is almost always made

is that the correlation time of the reservoir must be very short enough (Markov approximation)

for the interaction between the system and the bath to be small (weak coupling approximation).

Although several generalizations of the theory [3] which go beyond these approximation schemes

are now available which describe the various interesting physical situations in condensed matter

and quantum optical physics, one essential step is the assumption of an equilibrium distribution

of the reservoir modes. Very little attention has been paid to the problem where the reservoir in

contact with the system is itself not in equilibrium. This nonstationarity of the bath is known to

aﬀect the kinetics of the system [4-6] leading to nonexponential decay in contrast to exponential

decay in equilibrium activation rate theories. Thus the relaxation of the nonequilibrium modes

may inﬂuence the dissipation of the system in question in a nontrivial way. The present paper

addresses a related issue pertaining to quantum optical situations.

We extend the quantum theory of dissipation of a harmonic oscillator coupled to a bath where

2

the bath in question is in a nonequilibrum condition. The nonequilibrium bath is eﬀectively

realized in terms of a semi-inﬁnite dimensional broad-band reservoir which itself kept in contact

with a thermal reservoir. We make use of a systematic time scale separation to construct the

appropriate Langevin dynamics of the system mode. The ﬂuctuation-dissipation and the Einstein

relations have been suitably generalized. A detailed study of two model cases as immediate

applications has been carried out. We show that the Wigner-Weisskopf decay rate constant of the

system mode is dynamically modiﬁed when the system is coupled to a set of relaxing modes. We

also calculate the transient noise-spectra of the cavity mode with a positive gain. The result is

remarkably diﬀerent from the steady-state spectra.

The outline of the paper is as follows: In section II we ﬁrst generalize the quantum theory of

dissipation of a harmonic oscillator for a bath which is not in thermal equilibrium, followed by a

derivation of ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem in the next section III. Section IV is devoted to the

discussion of the Wigner-Weisskopf decay of the system. In section V we calculate the transient

noise spectra of the system mode with a positive gain. The paper is concluded in section VI.

II. THE MODEL AND THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION

To start with we consider a model consisting of a harmonic oscillator (the system) coupled to a

set of relaxing modes considered as a semi-inﬁnite dimensional system which eﬀectively constitutes

a nonequilibrium reservoir. This in turn is in contact with a thermally equilibrated reservoir. Both

the reservoirs are composed of two sets of harmonic oscillators characterized by the frequency sets

{ωj} and {Ωj} for the equilibrium and nonequilibrium bath, respectively. The system-reservoir

combination develops in time under the inﬂuence of the total Hamiltonian

The next two terms represent the coupling of the nonequilibrium bath with the system mode and

the thermal bath where the coupling constants are gµ and αjµ, respectively. In writing down the

Hamiltonian we have made use of the rotating wave approximation.

1 . Also note that δµν takes care secular approximation. Eq.(14) also implies

1
exp( ωn

−

a purely Ohmic frequency-independent dissipation of the nonequilibrium modes.

Taking into consideration of the standard ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation for the thermal bath

in terms of Eq.(14), we arrive at the following Langevin equation for the nonequilibrium bath

˙Cµ(t) = −iΩµCµ(t) − igµa(t) − γc

µµCµ(t) + fµ(t) .

(16)

Eq.(16) constitutes an important result of this section which takes into account of the relaxation

of the intermediate oscillator modes due to their coupling to the standard thermal bath whose

ﬂuctuations are described by fµ(t). It is important to note that the above consideration is based

on the rotating wave approximations (RWA) which is frequently used when considering coupling to

a heat bath in quantum optics. In the present case as we are to see in the subsequent sections that

there are quite subtle interaction eﬀects. The question whether these eﬀects would survive a more

complete treatment may naturally arise. We mention two pertinent points at this stage. First,

if one retains the nonrotating couplings in the Hamiltonian and carry out the same perturbative

procedure one arrives at an equation of motion for Cµ(t) [instead of Eq.(11) ] which additionally
contains secular oscillating terms of the form C †νei(Ωµ+Ων )(t
−

t0) . RWA amounts to neglecting these

contributions which may be important only at very high coupling. Secondly, Cµ modes executes

6

a slow relaxation dynamics on the time scale ∼ 1/γc

µµ as compared to the time scale of correlation

of thermal noise. The time scale of secular oscillations being short, those can be safely averaged

out from the relevant dynamics.

Another important point regarding RWA in the context of the present linear coupling model

Hamiltonian (1) needs to be considered. Ford, O’connell and Lewis [13] have demonstrated that

independent oscillator model within RWA (a variant of LC model) is seriously ﬂawed since the

Hamiltonian becomes imaginary when the bath is not passive ( i.e., there exists an associated

spectrum of eigenvalues ranging upto −∞ ). The problem essentially lies at the speciﬁc frequency

dependence of the coupling constant in its denominator (for example, as shown in Ref.

[13],

appropriately transformed gj in Eq. (1) is proportional to

). However, a standard procedure

1

in quantum optics is to replace the summation over modes by an integral over their density D(ωj),
(in free space equal to ( V ω2

. One thus gets rid of the

j(gj)2 →

k

(see, for example, calculation of Wigner-Weisskopf decay rate, Lamb et al in Ref.[1] ). Since we

have followed the same approach, RWA does not pose any problem in the present analysis. The

problem however, remains for a strictly discrete spectrum.

We have presented above an extension of the quantum theory of damping from Langevin point

of view within a traditional system-reservoir linear coupling scheme. Essentially the model consists

of replacing the reservoir by damping terms in the Heisenberg equations of motion for dissipation-

free system and adding ﬂuctuating forces as driving terms which add ﬂuctuations to the system.

The operator forces are such that (i) the system has the correct statistical properties to agree

in the classical limit and (ii) they maintain the commutation relations for Boson operators to

ensure that uncertainty principle is not violated. These considerations have been fully taken care

of in our analysis with appropriate elaboration in the following sections. The spiritual root of

the quantum statistical approach to damping lies in the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation, which

illustrates a dynamical balance of inward ﬂow of energy due to ﬂuctuations from the reservoir into

the system and the outward ﬂow of energy from the system to the reservoir due to the dissipation

7

of the system mode. We address this speciﬁc issue in the next section.

III. FLUCTUATION-DISSIPATION RELATION FOR NONEQUILIBRIUM BATH

To explore the inﬂuence of an initial excitation of the semi-inﬁnite dimensional intermediate

reservoir modes and its relaxation, we now consider the evolution of these linear modes Cµ in

terms of Eq.(16). The physical situation that has been addressed is the following;

We consider that at t = t0 the excitation is switched on and the bath modes (Cµ, C †µ) are

thrown into a nonstationary state such that they behave as a nonequilibrium reservoir undergoing

relaxation. We follow the stochastic dynamics of the system mode and the relaxation of the

nonequilibrium reservoir modes after t > t0. We assume that the eﬀect of back reaction of the

system mode on the reservoir modes is small enough to be neglected. Eq.(16) allows a formal

solution of the following form

where the amplitude C s

that in the absence of coupling gµ Eq.(16) allows the solution

In the steady state we neglect the ﬁrst term which decays rapidly. The second term is a

randomly ﬂuctuating term (which is the most important term in almost any Langevin analysis)

due to fµ(t). Substituting Eq.(8) in the above equation we obtain

where s signiﬁes the steady state. The above solution implies that C s

µ(t) is essentially a super-

position of unknown (since the initial condition for the inﬁnite number of thermal bath oscillator

bj(t0) are assumed to be completely uncertain) amplitudes (operators) and phases (c-numbers)

and may be written compactly in the form of Eq.(18). When written in the form (18) we obtain

an instantaneous realization of the random distribution of C s

µ and φs

µ. Thus Eq.(17) represents an

instantaneous solution of Eq.(16). To check the consistency of the solution (17) we note the follow-

ing points; (i) To recover initial deterministic amplitude of Cµ(t) we need an ensemble average of
Eq.(17) at t = t0 so that ¯C s

µ(t0) = 0. Also we are to see (subsequent to Eq.(24)) that the ﬁrst term

in Eq.(17) is responsible for the usual ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation when the nonequilibrium

modes get equilibrated at t = ∞ . C s

µ(t) in Cµ(t) is thus dictated by the condition of stationarity.

(iii) It can be easily seen that the random nature of the operator forces in C s

µ(t) is responsible for

maintaining the Boson commutation relation for Cµ(t) which further ensures that the uncertainty

principle is not violated.

The second term on the right hand side in Eq.(17) carries the information of relaxation of the

Cµ modes due to their coupling to the thermal bath and is a typical memory term. The third

term on the other hand represents the eﬀect of coupling of the system mode to the nonequilibrium

reservoir.

following Langevin equation for the system operator;

where

Γ = πg2(ω0)ρ(ω0)

(23)

can be identiﬁed as a dissipation constant of the system mode due to the ﬂuctuations of the

nonequilibrium reservoir in the limit when γc

µµ is vanishingly small. The explicit dependence of

the decay constant of the system mode on γ will be revealed clearly ( as a more general case ) in

the next section within the scope of Wigner-Weisskopf approximation.

The nonequilibrium generalization of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation is now immediately

apparent. From the expression for Z(t) (Eq.(21)) one ﬁnds that

Eq.(26) is the desired nonequilibrium generalization of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relationship.

This relates instantaneous ﬂuctuations of the nonequilibrium bath (which itself is undergoing re-

laxation at a rate γ due to its coupling with the thermal bath) to the dissipation of the energy

of the system mode through Γ. The nonequilibrium nature of the bath is implicit in the initial

preparation which creates an initial diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(t0) and also in the exponentially de-

caying term. In the long time limit one recovers the usual ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation for the

thermal bath at equilibrium.

12

We now express Eq.(26) in terms of energy density of ﬂuctuations of the nonequilibrium modes.

The energy density which is proportional to the power spectrum centered around ω0 is given by

It is important to note that t is the slow time variable which is well separated from the time scale

of thermal noise. The ﬂuctuations of the noise operator Z(t) is now explicitly determined by the

nonequilibrium state of the intermediate oscillator bath through its energy density u(Ω, t) at each

instant of time t. In other words the instantaneous nonequilibrium energy density distribution of

the ﬂuctuating modes is related to the friction coeﬃcient of these modes on the system degree of

freedom through a dynamic equilibrium. One can immediately recover the classical version of the

above equation in the high temperature limit ( where ¯n(Ω) = 1

The above equation was derived earlier [6] in the context of classical relaxation kinetics of complex

nonlinear systems. This reduction to classical version of the nonequilibrium ﬂuctuation-dissipation

relation serves as a consistency check for its quantum generalization (26) which is more relevant

in quantum optical issues that we address in this paper.

Another point should be emphasized regarding the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation (26). The

very notion of a nonequilibrium bath apparently suggests that frequency distribution function of

the modes of this bath should be a function of time and in principle, one should seek for it as

a self-consistent solution from a quantum kinetic analysis. We have followed here an alternative

route. Since we are working with Heisenberg operator equations of motion, the knowledge of initial

total state density which is factorizable in subsystem densities (for the system, thermal bath and

13

nonequilibrium or intermediate bath ) at t = 0, is suﬃcient to describe the complete dynamics in

terms of average values and correlation functions. We are concerned here (and also in classical

theory [6]) with a priori given frequency distribution functions for equilibrium {bj} bath (D(ω))

and nonequilibrium {Cµ} bath (ρ(Ω)) which are independent of time (nor we have introduced any

non-thermal temperature in describing the nonequilibrium bath). The essential content of the

nonequilibrium nature of the bath rests on a time-dependent energy density ﬂuctuation distribu-

tion function u(Ω, t) as described above (varying over a slower time scale compared to the time

scale of thermal noise ) which is a derived quantity rather than a self-consistently obtained func-

tion which might be obtainable from a quantum kinetic analysis. The eﬀect of initial excitation is

to create an energy density function u(Ω, 0) which diﬀers from its equilibrium counterpart. This

departure sets in a nonequilibrium situation. All these considerations also apply to the classical

version of nonequilibrium ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation [6].

Before bringing an end to this section some pertinent points are to be noted. First, we need

to stress that in the derivation of the relation (26) we assume that Z(t) is eﬀectively stationary

on the fast correlation time scale of the thermal bath. Second, the theory as developed above is

based on the consideration of quantum optical situations in mind. It is well known [2,11] that, in

general, the noise from the equilibrium bath at low temperatures is very diﬀerent from a simple

white noise and concerns expressions which contain integral from distribution function of the

bath over all frequencies. Most often such situations are encountered in condensed matter and

in chemical physics of complex systems. However in the problems of quantum optics where the

harmonic oscillator bath serves as a standard paradigm for optical ﬁelds one routinely uses a broad

band white noise spectrum such that

µ g2

µ ¯nµ is slowly varying and the summand in Eq.(24) is so

strongly peaked at Ωµ = ω0, that we may convert the sum into an integral and remove the slowly

P

varying factors to obtain the result (26) [ p. 422 of Louisell in Ref. 1 ]. Similar consideration leads

us to Einstein’s spontaneous emission coeﬃcient or Wigner-Weisskopf decay rate which contains

single frequency ω0, the characteristic frequency of the system mode. Thus although, in principle,

it may be possible to consider a colored noise spectrum and the resulting frequency dependence

14

of rate constants we restrict ourselves to former situations of broad band reservoir which itself is

undergoing a relaxation on the time scale of 1/γ. An important content of the present work is to

explore the eﬀect of this secondary relaxation on the primary kinetics of the system mode. The

nonequilibrium generalization of the ﬂuctuation dissipation relation as discussed in this section

serves as a basis of this exploration in following two quantum optical cases.

The expressions for the line width γW and the frequency shift δω of the system mode thus

obtained due to the relaxation of the nonequilibrium bath are markedly diﬀerent from the usual

expressions of Wigner-Weisskopf theory. This is because of the explicit dependence of γW and δω

on the γ in Eqs.(32) and (33) which arises due to the relaxation of the nonequilibrium modes due

to their coupling with the thermal bath. In the limit γ → 0 one recovers the usual decay rate Γ

and the level-shift terms, i.e.,

It may be noted that while deriving γW and δω, weak coupling and smooth density of states

ρ(Ω) for the intermediate oscillators have been assumed. By the same token, the correction terms

in Eq. (34) are small and the result for A(t) as expressed in Eq.(34) could be simpliﬁed further

to the following form,

where χ(ω0) is given by

The primary evolution of the system mode A thus depends on the secondary relaxation of the

intermediate oscillators explicitly.

The expression for γW (Eq.(32)) illustrates a dynamical modiﬁcation of the Wigner-Weisskopf

decay rate constant since it incorporates the eﬀect of coupling of the nonequilibrium bath to the

thermal bath through γ. The modiﬁcation of atomic spontaneous decay rate both in the form of

enhancement and suppression by appropriate tailoring of vacuum modes of the cavity is now well

known in cavity QED [7]. Whereas in the cavity QED problems one essentially 77manipulates the

boundary conditions in various ways, the present modiﬁcation is eﬀectively dynamical in nature in

the sense that it carries the eﬀect of relaxation of the nonequilibrium modes on the dissipation of

17

the system mode. It is then also expected that the atomic decay rate might be similarly aﬀected

in appropriately modiﬁed situations.

Before completing this section we point out that in the present problem of quantum theory

of dissipation in the quantum optical context we are concerned with the frequency spectrum of

the radiation ﬁeld modes. In the context of solid state the frequency density is assumed to be of

the Debye type with appropriate regularization by cutoﬀ at high frequency. In the cavity QED

problems adjustment of boundary conditions may lead to diﬀerent density of states. Although

there is no generalization of the dependence of friction on the frequency spectrum, in general, one

encounters a time-retarded friction.

V. TIME-DEPENDENT SPECTRUM OF A CAVITY MODE WITH GAIN IN

CONTACT WITH NONEQUILIBRIUM BATH

An immediate consequence of the nonequilibrium generalization of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation

relation is the explicit time dependence of the diﬀusion constant, as evident in Eq.(26). It is there-

fore expected that this time-dependence may make its presence felt if one analyses the transient

noise spectrum of the system mode. With this end in view we now calculate the time-dependent

spectrum of a cavity ﬁeld mode coupled to a nonequilibrium reservoir which causes the ﬁeld mode

to decay at the rate Γ. Generally we ﬁnd the spectrum by applying the quantum regression the-

orem to the Langevin equation for a quantized ﬁeld mode interacting with a medium described

by a gain α. In general, the complex gain α(t) is an operator that is saturated by the number

operator A†(t)A(t) [p. 467 of Ref.12]. The Langevin equation for our problem is given by,

˙A(t) = −(Γ + iδ − α)A(t) + Z(t) ,

(36)

where A(t) and Z(t) are slowly varying annihilation and noise operators, respectively. In general,

Eq.(36) applies to laser-like situations including those with two-level and semiconductor media

18

(37)

(38)

(39)

[12]. Here δ(= ω0 − ν) is the detuning of the mode oscillation frequency ν from the passive cavity

resonance frequency ω0 and α, the gain coeﬃcient is assumed to be a real number (Γ > α). Z(t)

is the noise source operator as given by

It has also to be noted that since we are dealing with a non-stationary situation the standard

steady state spectrum is not applicable. We therefore take resort to non-steady state spectrum

or the so-called “physical spectrum” of the cavity mode [8] where the attention is focused on the

dynamic evolution of the spectrum following an abrupt excitation of a near-resonant cavity mode.

The main reason for studying the time-dependent spectrum is that the familiar power spectrum of

the Wiener-Khintchine theorem is not applicable to nonstationary processes. Although in quite a

number of earlier cases time-dependent spectrum of Page and Lampard were used widely serious

objections were raised against this spectrum (e.g., it can be negative). Eberly and Wodkiewicz

have shown that the suitably normalized counting rate of a photodetector can be used to deﬁne

a time-dependent spectrum or physical spectrum. This allows the inﬂuence of the spectrum

analyzer (basically a Fabry-Perot interferometer, for example) to be exhibited in the spectrum

so that the band limit of the measuring device is appropriately incorporated which makes the

spectrum free from ambiguities and unphysical characteristics of earlier spectrum.

It has also

been emphasized [9] that when the instrument width, W is narrow enough such that W ≪ Γ ,

the spectrum appears to be qualitatively similar to Wiener-Khintchine spectrum. This transient

19

spectrum has been used earlier in several occasions in connection with resonance ﬂuorescence

studies [9], micromaser problem [10] etc. One can deﬁne the time-dependent spectrum or the

physical spectrum as follows;

S(t, ω, W ) = 2W Re

Here the symbols have the following meaning : t is the elapsed time after the system and

the reservoir have been subjected to initial excitation at t = t0(= 0), W is the full width of the

transmission peak of the interferometer and ∆(= ω − ν) is the detuning, or frequency oﬀset of

the Fabry-Perot line center above the frequency of the ﬁeld ω. It is important to note that the

time-dependent spectrum is expressed in terms of two integrals in Eq.(40). The ﬁrst integral is

over the correlation time and is actually the counterpart of the Wiener-Khintchine spectrum band

limited by the width of the measuring device, W , while the second one over t2 takes into account

of the nonstationarity which makes the correlation function t2 dependent. The device width in

the second integral also sets the limit over the time scale of this nonstationarity.

Since the time-evolution of the system is governed by Eq.(36), one can make use of the quantum

regression hypothesis which yields two-time correlation function

It is interesting to note that at short time the eﬀect of nonequilibrium bath is prominent through

γ and r. While r(= D(0)

condition by a sudden external excitation at t = 0 which makes the initial diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(0)

D(

to be diﬀerent from its stationary long time value D(∞), γ carries the information of relaxation. As

expected, the steady state spectrum is independent of both γ and r. This is because at large time

when the nonequilibrium bath is equilibrated, the system forgets its past and the time-dependence

of diﬀusion coeﬃcient is erased and the spectrum becomes the steady state spectrum.

We now look for the transient characteristics of the spectra of the cavity mode.

In Fig 1

we plot the spectra for diﬀerent scaled time t after the initial excitation, Γ being used as a

scaling parameter. For numerical computation we choose the following scaled parameter set :

W = 4, α = 0.1, r = 1 and γ = 0.1. One observes that after the initial excitation the spectra grow

to a maximum and then the peak height start diminishing and eventually reaches the steady state

22

value. Thus the eﬀect of relaxation of the nonequilibrium bath becomes prominent in the short

time region. The variation of peak intensity with time for the three diﬀerent γ has been shown in

Fig2. It is apparent that the spectrum reaches the steady state more quickly for larger values of

γ and also for small γ the maximum peak is larger than that for larger γ.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed the quantum theory of dissipation of a harmonic oscillator coupled to a

nonequilibrium bath in terms of a microscopic model. Making use of appropriate separation of

time scales one can construct an eﬀective Langevin dynamics with memory (where the memory

functions are not the phenomenological inputs) which is due to the relaxation of the nonequilibrium

bath modes and identify the relevant noise sources. An essential oﬀshoot is the nonequilibrium

generalizations of the familiar ﬂuctuation-dissipation and Einstein’s relations. It is important to

note that the Wigner-Weisskopf decay rate constant of the oscillator is dynamically modiﬁed. The

theory is further applied to calculate the time-dependent spectrum of a cavity mode with suitable

gain. One observes that the nonequilibrium nature of the bath modes makes its presence felt in

the time-dependence of the diﬀusion constant leading to the diﬀerential behavior of the transient

spectra from the steady-state ones. Although in the present problem we are mainly concerned

with the dissipation of energy, it may also be worthwhile to investigate the problem of decoherence

on similar footing. We hope to address this and related issues in future.

Generalized Einstein’s relations

In this section we outline the derivation of the nonequilibrium generalization of Einstein’s

relations Eq.(41).

The system operators follow the Langevin equation of motion Eq.(35)

˙A = −(Γ + iδ − α)A + Z(t) ;

where the ﬁrst term within the parenthesis of the right hand side is the drift term and Z(t) is the

nonequilibrium noise operator [Eq.(37)] . From the identity

A†(t) = A†(t − ∆t) +

dt′ ˙A†(t′)

t

we ﬁrst obtain the correlation function of the system and the noise operator ;

(50)

(51)

hA†(t)Z(t)i = hA†(t − ∆t)Z(t)i +

dt′h[−(Γ − iδ − α)A†(t′) + Z(t′)]Z(t)i.

(52)

Because the operator A†(t′) at time t′ is not aﬀected by ﬂuctuation at a later time t, the ﬁrst

term on the right hand side is zero. Similarly the correlation hA†(t′)Z(t)i is zero except at the

point t′ = t but the integration is zero. Thus we have

hA†(t)Z(t)i =

dt′hZ †(t′)Z(t)i.

(53)

Note that we have not assumed the stationary property of the noise.

Next we determine the equation of motion for the average hA†(t)A(t)i;

hA†(t)A(t)i = h ˙A†(t)A(t)i + hA†(t) ˙A(t)i.

hA†(t)A(t)i = −2(Γ − α)hA†(t)A(t)i + hZ †(t)A(t)i + hA†(t)Z(t)i.

Substituting Eq.(52) and its adjoint in Eq.(55) and performing the integral over t′ where we

use Eq.(39), we obtain the nonequilibrium generalization of Einstein’s relation

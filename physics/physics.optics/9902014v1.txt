Theoretical Study of Phase Conjugation
in Mesoscopic Interaction Volumes

Preface

The present monograph describes results of my work carried out at the Institute of
Physics at Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark in the period from February 1995 to
May 1998 and at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Mississippi State Univer-
sity, Starkville, Mississippi, United States of America in the period from August 1996
to January 1997. This monograph is submitted as a Ph.D. thesis to the Faculty of Engi-
neering and Science at Aalborg University.

With this dissertation, I intend to describe in a uniﬁed fashion the work done in the
time frame of the programme. It is my intention that the contents of this monograph
should go deeper and broader into the material that has been processed for publishing in
articles, and thus include results and comments on material not suitable for publication
as parts of an article. The work is divided into six main parts, each consisting of some
separate chapters. The outline of this monograph is presented in the following.

Outline of the dissertation

The motivation for carrying out the present study is given in Part I, divided into three
separate chapters. In Chapter 1 a brief summary of the contributions to scientiﬁc progress
within the last century, which I believe are the most important for my work, is presented.
The historical summary includes remarks on nonlinear optics in general, optical phase
conjugation in particular, near-ﬁeld optics, and mesoscopic optics. Chapter 2 presents
the theoretical model usually adopted in optical phase conjugation (standard theory).
Chapter 3 consists of a discussion of the limitations of the standard theory as well as
the requirements to a theoretical model that can be used when interaction takes place on
small length scales and/or in the optical near-ﬁeld region.

In Part II the task of developing a nonlocal theoretical description of phase conjugation
of optical near-ﬁelds by degenerate four wave mixing is undertaken. It consists of three
chapters. In Chapter 4 the basic working frame for the present treatment is established,
starting from Maxwell’s equations. Chapter 5 sets up the ﬁrst and third order responses
of an electron using the density matrix formalism starting from the Liouville equation of
motion. In Chapter 6 the general conductivity response tensors for degenerate four-wave
mixing excluding spin-effects are established, and their symmetries are discussed. Part
II is concluded with a small discussion.

Preface

Part III discusses degenerate four-wave mixing in quantum-well structures on a some-
what general level. For this purpose, two chapters are written. In Chapter 8 the con-
ductivity response tensors in the case where a system has broken translational invariance
in one spatial direction are established and discussed, and Chapter 9 is devoted to a
discussion of the consequences of scattering in a plane using polarized light.

In Part IV the optical phase conjugation response of a single-level quantum well is
studied in four chapters. In Chapter 10 the theoretical considerations necessary to de-
scribe the phase conjugation response from a single-level quantum well are discussed,
and in Chapter 11 the numerical results for the phase conjugated response from a copper
quantum well are discussed. Chapter 12 consists of a discussion of two-dimensional con-
ﬁnement of light in front of the single-level quantum-well phase conjugator considered
in Chapters 10 and 11. Chapter 13 concludes this part with a short discussion.

Part V takes a similar point of view as Part IV, but for the two-level quantum well.
Theoretical considerations are presented in Chapter 14, while the numerical results are
discussed in Chapter 15. A short discussion concludes this part in Chapter 16.

Part VI contains a concluding discussion on the developed theory and the numerical

work followed by an outlook.

There are ﬁve Appendices included, consisting of calculations not suitable for the
main text. Appendix A is a calculation of the linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors
relevant for studying degenerate four-wave mixing in quantum well structures. Appendix
B contains the principal analytic solutions to the integrals over the states parallel to the
In Appendix C, the
plane of translational invariance in the quantum well structures.
absolute solution to the integrals over the states parallel to the plane of translational
invariance in the quantum well structures are presented in terms of the principal solutions
given in Appendix B. Appendix D contains a small calculation of the Fermi energy
for a quantum well in the low-temperature limit and a calculation of the minimal and
maximal values of the thickness of a quantum well given the desired number of occupied
eigenstates across the quantum well. Appendix E contains some intermediate results in
the calculation of the integrals over the source region in Chapter 14.

References used in this work are listed in the bibliography at the end of the dissertation
according to the recommendations by the thirteenth edition of The Chicago Manual of
Style with author(s), title, and publication data in alphabetic order after the ﬁrst authors
surname.

Latin indices {i, j, k, h} generally refers to the three spatial coordinate labels {x, y, z},
and the latin indices {n, m, v, l} generally refers to quantum states. Exceptions from this
are (i) when the letter “i” appears in formulae and is not an index, it is the complex
number i2 = −1, (ii) when the letter “k” appears in formulae and is not an index, it
is the wavenumber k = |~k|, (iii) the letter “m” with an index “e” is the electron mass.
Summations over repeated indices are stated explicitly whenever it should be performed.

Software used in this project

Creation of the numerical results presented in this work has been done through develop-
ment of computer programs, mainly in Fortran 90 (Metcalf and Reid 1996). The ﬁnal
set of programs consists of approximately 6000 lines of code developed by the present
author. Because of the size I have chosen not to include a reprint of the code in this
monograph. The presentation of the calculated data is done using gnuplot pre-3.6 with
some 400 lines of code to generate the plots as encapsulated PostScript ﬁles. This dis-
sertation has been typed entirely in LATEX 2e
(Goossens, Mittelbach, and Samarin 1994;
Goossens, Rahtz, and Mittelbach 1997), an enhanced version of the typesetting program
TEX, originally developed by Knuth (1984).

Historical perspective

Indeed, as the great orator expressed it more than two millenia ago, nature has planted
in our minds an insatiable longing to see the truth. This natural curiosity, I believe, has
been the driving force behind scientiﬁc investigations in the history of mankind, and thus
also behind the evolution of electromagnetic theory. But since the electrodynamic theory
as we know it was initiated by Maxwell (1864, 1891), I will in the following historical
remarks concentrate on the physics of the past century. Readers who want an overview
of the evolution of electromagnetic theories before this century are referred to Born and
Wolf (1980), and the comprehensive survey of Whittaker (1951).

The work described in the present dissertation is mainly concerned with a theoretical
description of a nonlinear type of electromagnetic interactions called degenerate four-
wave mixing (DFWM), particularly in the case where phase conjugation is obtained.
The main interest behind this study is to model the behaviour of the DFWM interaction
in mesoscopic volumes and in the optical near-ﬁeld zone. Thus, in relation to established
branches of modern optics, this work belongs to the ﬁelds of nonlinear optics (especial-
ly four-wave mixing), near-ﬁeld optics, and mesoscopic systems. In the remaining of
this chapter I therefore intend to describe brieﬂy the contributions to scientiﬁc progress
within the last century, which I believe are the most signiﬁcant for the present study.

Although Einstein already in 1916 predicted the existence of stimulated emission
(Einstein 1916, 1917), the main objective of optics remained linear observations until
after the development of the maser in the early 1950’s, where Townes and co-workers at
Columbia University used stimulated emission for ampliﬁcation of an electromagnetic
ﬁeld in combination with a resonator (Gordon, Zeiger, and Townes 1954, 1955). An
application of the principles of the maser in the optical region of the electromagnetic
spectrum was proposed in 1958 by Schawlow and Townes, and in 1960 Maiman con-
structed the ﬁrst laser—a pulsed ruby laser. The ﬁrst laser delivering a continous-wave
output was constructed in 1961 using a mixture of Helium and Neon gasses (Javan, Jr.,
and Herriot 1961). The laser rapidly became of signiﬁcant importance in optical physics,
where the ﬁeld of nonlinear optics was ignited by the successful observation by Franken,
Hill, Peters, and Weinrich (1961) of radiation of light at the second harmonic frequency
(with a wavelength l of 3472 ˚A) generated by a quartz crystal illuminated with light
from a ruby laser (l = 6943 ˚A). Since then nonlinear optics has been of interest to many
researchers around the globe exploring a large number of different nonlinear phenom-

ena, such as second-, third-, and higher order harmonic generation, optical rectiﬁcation,
sum and difference frequency generation, three-, four-, six-, and higher-number wave-
mixing, laser cooling, laser induced atomic fusion, stimulated Raman- and Brillouin
scattering, to mention a few [see, e.g., Bloembergen (1965), Boyd (1992), Mandel and
Wolf (1995), Yariv and Yeh (1984), Shen (1984), Schubert and Wilhelmi (1986), and
Mukamel (1995)].

The optical effect of interest in this work, optical phase conjugation, is nowadays
usually produced by means of nonlinear optics, although the problem of reconstructing
electromagnetic wavefronts started in the linear optical regime. The pioneering work
on optical wavefront reconstruction (holography) was carried out several years before
the invention of the laser by Gabor (1948, 1949) with the purpose of improving the re-
solving power of the electron microscope [see also Bragg (1950)]. But only with the
high intensities and with the degree of temporal and spatial coherence provided by the
laser, holographic imaging became of practical importance. Such experiments were ﬁrst
reported by Leith and Upatnieks (1962, 1964). Soon thereafter Kogelnik (1965) used
a hologram to correct static phase distortions introduced onto an optical wavefront. In
this experiment a photosensitive ﬁlm was used for holographic recording of an image,
and the ﬁlm had to be developed prior to its application for phase correction. This
experiment of Kogelnik appears to be the ﬁrst account on optical phase conjugation.
However, since a new ﬁlm has to be developed every time the phase distortion changes,
this technique becomes rather cumbersome if the phase distortions changes frequently.
A key discovery of Gerritsen (1967) made it possible to store holograms dynamically in
crystals with an intensity-dependent refractive index, thereby extending the applicability
domain of optical phase conjugation to cover descriptions where phase distortions are
varying in time. Experimentally, the ﬁrst real-time optical phase conjugation are cre-
dited to Zel’dovich and co-workers (Zel’dovich, Popovichev, Ragul’skii, and Faizullov
1972; Nosach, Popovichev, Ragul’skii, and Faizullov 1972), in an experiment based on
stimulated Brillouin scattering. In the late 1970’s, Hellwarth (1977) suggested the use
of a degenerate four-wave mixing process to produce the phase conjugated ﬁeld. Im-
mediately thereafter Yariv and Pepper (1977), and independently, Bloom and Bjorklund
(1977), further analyzed the optical phase conjugation via DFWM, resulting in predic-
tions of ampliﬁed reﬂection, coherent image ampliﬁcation and oscillation. Over the past
twentyﬁve years, thousands of scientiﬁc papers, several books and review articles de-
scribing different aspects and applications of optical phase conjugation have been pub-
lished, and phase conjugation in the form of DFWM is now an established discipline
in modern experimental optics. The theoretical treatments of optical phase conjugation
are usually based upon the work of Yariv (1978), using the phase conjugating system
as a device in studies of other processes. A comprehensive and coherent introduction to
the ﬁeld of optical phase conjugation can be found in the books by Zel’dovich, Pilipet-
sky, and Shkunov (1985) and Sakai (1992), while a more specialized introduction can
be achieved through collections of review papers appearing in books by Fisher (1983)
and Gower and Proch (1994), or separately, by Pepper (1982, 1985), Hellwarth (1982),
and Knoester and Mukamel (1991). Other collections of papers can be found in, e.g.,

Goodman (1983), and Brueck (1989). Within the last few years, DFWM has been used
for creation of optical phase conjugation in conﬁgurations where the probe ﬁeld and
the detector are within subwavelength distances from the phase-conjugating medium
(Bozhevolnyi, Keller, and Smolyaninov 1994; Vohnsen 1997; Bozhevolnyi 1997).

The ﬁrst account of attention to subwavelength (optical near-ﬁeld) interaction of light
with matter seems to be Synge (1928, 1932), who proposed an apparatus, in which
a sample is illuminated through a small aperture in an opaque screen, the area of the
aperture being substantially smaller than the diffraction limit of the light used for the il-
lumination (of subwavelength size). The aperture should be moved in small increments
(scanned) over the sample by use of a piezo-electric crystal. At every step of the scanning
procedure the light transmitted through the sample should be collected and the intensity
measured. The resolving power of such an instrument should be limited by the size of the
aperture and the distance from the aperture to the sample rather than by the wavelength
of the illuminating light. For whatever reason, the proposal of Synge was forgotten,
and even though Bethe (1944) and Bouwkamp (1950a, 1950b) discussed the problem
of diffraction by small holes, the idea of an optical near-ﬁeld microscope remained for-
gotten until O’Keefe (1956) made the proposal, apparently without any knowledge of
the instrument proposed by Synge. The ﬁrst demonstration of an image obtained with
scanning in the electromagnetic near-ﬁeld zone was given by Ash and Nichols (1972),
who used microwaves of wavelength of 3cm to resolve metallic gratings with linewidths
down to 0.5mm, corresponding to 1/60-th of a wavelength. Another twelve years should
pass before near-ﬁeld electrodynamics was adressed again. Near-ﬁeld optics evolved in
the mid-eighties in the wake of the experimental works by the groups of Pohl, Lewis,
and Fischer (Pohl, Denk, and Lanz 1984; Lewis, Isaacson, Harootunian, and Murray
1984; Fischer 1985; Fischer and Pohl 1989). The main efforts of this new branch of
modern optics is concentrated on the original idea of subwavelength imaging [see, for
example, the recently published book by Paesler and Moyer (1996), the proceedings of
the ﬁrst conference on near-ﬁeld optics (Pohl and Courjon 1993), or proceedings from
later conferences in near-ﬁeld optics (Isaacson 1995; Paesler and van Hulst 1995; Nieto-
Vesperinas and Garc´ıa 1996; van Hulst and Lewis 1998)].

The appearance of microscopes with subwavelength resolution inevitably poses the
questions of the resolution limit and the degree of spatial conﬁnement of light—two in-
separable questions in near-ﬁeld optics. Fundamentally, the spatial conﬁnement problem
is linked to the ﬁeld-matter interaction in the vicinity of the source emitting the ﬁeld and
in the near-ﬁeld region of the detector. In classical optics, near-ﬁeld effects traditionally
have played a minor role, and the possibilities for studying material properties on a small
length scale usually are judged in relation to the diffraction limit criterion attributed to
Ernst Abbe (1873) and the third baron Rayleigh (1896). The Rayleigh criterion, though
mainly invoked in the context of spatial resolution, also sets the limit for the possibili-
ties of light compression in far-ﬁeld studies. As already emphasized by lord Rayleigh
and later discussed, for instance, by Ronchi (1961), the resolution problem is not a sim-
ple one, even in classical optics. A recent survey of the resolution problem within the
framework of classical optics has been given by den Dekker and van den Bos (1997).

Part I: Motivation

When the interaction length of an electromagnetic ﬁeld across the individual struc-
tures in a condensed matter system is on the order of an optical wavelength (typically
a few atomic distances), the theoretical description of the ﬁeld-matter interaction be-
longs to the ﬁeld of mesoscopic electrodynamics. Within the last two decades studies of
the optical properties of mesoscopic systems, such as quantum wells (single and mul-
tiple), -wires and -dots, surfaces, interfaces, and more exotic geometries have drawn
the attention of many researchers. Because of the immediate potential for industrial
application many of these studies have been concentrated on the properties of semicon-
ductors (see, e.g., Weisbuch and Vinter (1991), and references herein). In recent years
in particular investigations of the nonlinear electrodynamics have been in focus. Among
the many nonlinear phenomena studies of second harmonic generation (Sipe and Stege-
man 1982; Richmond, Robinson, and Shannon 1988; Heinz 1991; Reider and Heinz
1995; Liebsch 1995; Pedersen 1995), sum- and difference frequency generation (Reider
and Heinz 1995; Bavli and Band 1991), photon drag (Keller 1993; Vasko 1996; Chen
and Keller 1997; Keller and Wang 1997), DC-electric-ﬁeld induced second harmonic
generation (Aktsipetrov, Melnikov, Murzina, Nikulin, and Rubtsov 1995; Aktsipetrov,
Fedyanin, and Downer 1996), the Kerr effect (Pustogowa, H¨ubner, and Bennemann
1994; Liu and Keller 1995; Rasing and Goerkamp 1995; Rasing 1996), electronic and
vibrational surface Raman scattering (Nkoma 1989; Mishchenko and Fal’kovskii 1995;
Garcia-Vidal and Pentry 1996), two-photon photoemission (Haight 1995; Fauster and
Steinmann 1995; Georges 1995; Shalaev, Douketis, Haslett, Stuckless, and Moskovits
1996; Tergiman, Warda, Girardeau-Montaut, and Girardeau-Montaut 1997), and gen-
eration of higher harmonics (von der Linde 1996; Gavrila 1992) have played a promi-
nent role. Among the more exotic phenomena, studies of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in
mesoscopic rings (Wang 1997) and whispering-gallery modes in microspheres (Knight,
Dubreuil, Sandoghdar, Hare, Lef`evre-Seguin, Raimond, and Haroche 1995) have also
been carried out lately.

From a theoretical point of view the refractive index concept becomes meaningless for
structures of mesoscopic size. Therefore, macroscopic approaches to describe the ﬁeld-
matter interaction have to be abandoned from the outset, and the theoretical analyses
have to be based on the microscopic Maxwell equations combined with the Schr¨odinger
equation. The Schr¨odinger equation describes the quantum state of the condensed matter
system, and is a fundamental part of the quantum mechanics initiated in the beginning of
the 20th century by such scientists as Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Born, Jordan,
de Broglie, Schr¨odinger and Dirac. Even an attempt to give a satisfactory historical
survey of the development of quantum mechanics at this point will fail because of the
almost universal status quantum mechanics has reached in the description of modern
physics. Instead, for the history of quantum mechanics including a description of the
mathematical foundation, please consult for example von Neumann (1932) or Bohm
(1951). A modern and comprehensive description of quantum mechanics is given by
Cohen-Tannoudji, Diu, and Lalo¨e (1977), where also a comprehensive list of references
to key papers can be found. An example of interesting papers is the series of articles by
Schr¨odinger (1926a, 1926b).

Chapter 2

Standard theory of
optical phase conjugation by degenerate four-wave mixing

Optical phase conjugation is a nonlinear optical phenomenon, in which an incoming op-
tical ﬁeld is reﬂected in such a manner that the wavefronts of the reﬂected ﬁeld coincide
with the incoming ﬁeld, hence also the name “wavefront inversion”, frequently used in
the literature. The principle of optical phase conjugation has gained widespread atten-
tion because of its ability to correct for distortions introduced in a path traversed by an
optical signal. In principle, it works like this: An optical source is placed on one side
of a distorting medium (crystal, waveguide, atmosphere, etc.). A system in which phase
conjugation takes place (called the phase conjugator) is placed on the other side of the
distorting medium. A ﬁeld emitted from the source in the direction of the phase conjuga-
tor then travel through the distorting medium, and is reﬂected by the phase conjugator.
The phase conjugator reverses the wavefront of the incoming (probe) ﬁeld, and when
the reﬂected light comes back through the distorting medium, the wavefront is (ideally)
exactly reversed, compared to that originally emitted by the source. Since it is possible
to see how the light was originally emitted by the source by looking at the phase conju-
gated replica, it is sometimes also given the somewhat misleading term “time reversal”
(Yariv 1978). Several schemes exist to achieve phase conjugation, the most widely used
called “degenerate four-wave mixing” (DFWM). Optical phase conjugation in the form
of degenerate four-wave mixing (DFWM) is a nonlinear third order effect, where mixing
of two counterpropagating “pump” ﬁelds and a “probe” (or “signal”) ﬁeld—all with the
same frequency w —results in, among other signals, a generated ﬁeld (the “conjugate”)
with frequency w = w + w − w

, which is counterpropagating to the probe ﬁeld.

In the following, I present the theoretical model usually adopted in studies of optical
phase conjugation by degenerate four-wave mixing, and consequently this chapter will
consist mainly of textbook material. The treatment roughly follows that of Yariv and
Fisher (1983) and of Boyd (1992). The DFWM geometry suggested by Yariv and Pepper
(1977) is shown in Fig. 2.1. In this conﬁguration, a lossless nonlinear optical medium
is illuminated by two strong counterpropagating pump ﬁelds ~E1 and ~E2 and by a weak
signal (probe) wave ~E3. The pump ﬁelds are usually taken to be plane waves, although
they in principle are allowed to have any kind of wavefront as long as their amplitudes are
complex conjugates of each other. The probe ﬁeld can have a more complex wavefront.
Resulting from the mixing process in the medium a conjugate ﬁeld appears, propagating
in the direction oppositely to the probe.

In order to describe the electromagnetic ﬁeld we ﬁrst establish the wave equation
for the interacting ﬁelds from the macroscopic Maxwell equations. It is thereafter re-
duced to its slowly varying envelope approximation (SVEA) form. The four macro-
scopic Maxwell equations are

~D(~r,t) = e 0~E(~r,t) + e 0~P(~r,t),

~P(~r,t) = ~PL(~r,t) + ~PNL(~r,t).

We now assume that the material is homogeneous, nonmagnetic (~B = µ0~H), and non-
conducting (~J =~0) and that there are no free charges (r = 0). We write the displacement
vector ~D(~r,t) as

where ~P(~r,t) is the polarization, which we split into its linear, ~PL, and nonlinear, ~PNL,
components

Above, the linear polarization describes the material response due to interaction with the

ization in the manner ~PL = c

(1). Taking the curl of Eq. (2.1) and
inserting Eq. (2.2) into the resulting equation, we obtain (by use of the operator identity

ric approximation). Since we have assumed the medium to be lossless, the susceptibility
tensors are real time-independent quantities, and hence also e r is a real quantity. The lin-
ear susceptibility tensor is included in the linear polarization (~PL) above, and the lowest

where ~Ea (~r) are slowly varying quantities, and the wavevector ~ka
is real. Since we
assumed that the pump ﬁelds ~E1(~r,t) and ~E2(~r,t) are counterpropagating, the sum of
their wavevectors is zero, i.e., ~k1 +~k2 =~0. Inserting Eq. (2.11) into Eq. (2.9), a large
number of terms are generated. In the phase conjugation conﬁguration we are partic-
ularly interested in the terms related to the ﬁrst harmonic in the cyclic frequency w
.
Among these terms are terms that can act as phase-matched source terms for the con-
jugate wave ~E4(~r,t) when the probe and conjugate ﬁelds are counterpropagating, i.e.,
when ~k3 +~k4 =~0. Using these two properties of the wavevectors, terms with a spatial
dependence of the form ei~ka

matched terms for the four interacting electric ﬁelds. The polarizations associated with

wave equation is satisﬁed, when each of the four ﬁelds and their related polarizations
satisfy the wave equation separately. Next, assuming that the pump ﬁelds are much
stronger than the probe and the conjugate ﬁelds, we can drop the terms in Eqs. (2.12)–

with the pump ﬁelds have been decoupled from the probe and conjugate ﬁelds. Then we
may ﬁrst solve the wave equations for the pump ﬁelds, and thereafter insert the result
into the wave equations for the probe and conjugate ﬁelds. Following this insertion, the

still in the short notation from above. Assuming now that we have an isotropic medium,
the susceptibility tensors must be invariant to inversion and rotation around any axis
in the chosen Cartesian coordinate system. The demand of inversion symmetry leaves
all tensor elements with an odd number of x’s, y’s, or z’s zero, and thus only diagonal
elements survive in the linear susceptibility tensor, and only the 21 elements in the non-
ii j j, c (3)
linear susceptibility tensor of the form c (3)
i ji j are nonzero, i and j being any
x, y, or z. The demand of invariance to rotational transformations results in the demand
that the three remaining nonzero elements of the linear susceptibility tensor are equal,
and thus we ﬁnd that e r = 1
e r. In terms of the refractive index n of the medium, that
is e r = n2. For the nonlinear susceptibility tensor this demand implies that the nonzero
elements can be written

Part I: Motivation

To achieve perfect phase matching between the probe and the conjugate ﬁeld, k has to be
constant along z, requiring that k 1 = k 2, which means that the intensity of the two pump
ﬁelds must be the same (|E1(z)|2 = |E2(z)|2). If we additionally introduce a change of

degenerate four-wave mixing leads to phase conjugation, since the generated ﬁeld E ′
4(z)
is driven only by the complex conjugate of the probe ﬁeld amplitude. Differentiation of
Eq. (2.29) and insertion of Eq. (2.30), an vice versa, we get

Thus the phase conjugated ﬁeld depends on (i) the intensity of the pump ﬁelds, (ii) the

probe ﬁeld.

Chapter 3

Discussion

The theoretical description given in the preceding chapter is not the only existing de-
scription of phase conjugation by DFWM in the macroscopic sense, but it illustrates
quite well the usual line of thought when considering optical phase conjugation. As ex-
amples on theoretical papers going beyond the description in Chapter 2, let us mention
that (i) polarization properties have been studied by Ducloy and Bloch (1984), (ii) de-
scriptions taking into account the vectorial properties [see Eq. (2.20)] have been given,
e.g., by Syed, Crofts, Green, and Damzen (1996), (iii) improvements to the standard
theory in the form of abandoning the slowly varying envelope approximation (SVEA)
have also been discussed [see, e.g., Marburger (1983) and Farzad and Tavassoly (1997)].
A feature of the standard theory [see Eq. (2.37)] is that the phase conjugated response
depends on the length of the nonlinear crystal used (inﬁnite at k L = (2p + 1)p /2 for any
integer value of p). The standard theory has proven to be a satisfactory description for
spatially nondecaying ﬁelds containing no evanescent components.

Though the overwhelming majority of optical phase conjugation experiments can be
described without inclusion of evanescent components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, the
possible phase conjugation of these components has been discussed from time to time.
With the experimental observation of Bozhevolnyi, Keller, and Smolyaninov (1994,
1995), the need for inclusion of near-ﬁeld components and thus evanescent modes in
the description of optical phase conjugation has drawn renewed attention.

In an important paper by Agarwal and Gupta (1995) the treatment was focused on an
analysis of the phase conjugated replica produced by a so-called ideal phase conjugator,
characterized phenomenologically by a polarization- and angle of incidence independent
nonlinear amplitude reﬂection coefﬁcient, and in recent articles by Keller (1996b, 1996c)
attention was devoted to an investigation of the spatial conﬁnement problem of the phase
conjugated ﬁeld. Macroscopic theories including near-ﬁeld components in the optical
phase conjugation process have also appeared recently (Bozhevolnyi, Bozhevolnaya,
and Berntsen 1995; Arnoldus and George 1995).

In their work Bozhevolnyi, Keller, and Smolyaninov used degenerate four-wave mix-
ing (DFWM) produced by a 10mW HeNe laser with a wavelength of 633nm in an iron-
doped lithium-niobate (Fe:LiNbO3) crystal and an external-reﬂection near-ﬁeld optical
microscope to achieve phase conjugated light foci, which with a diameter of ∼ 180nm
were well below the classical diffraction limit. The main conclusion of their experiments

13

14

Part I: Motivation

was that to achieve a spot size as small as 180nm phase conjugation of at least parts of
the optical near-ﬁeld emitted from the source must have taken place.

In the present work we go one step further in the theoretical study of the phase con-
jugation of optical signals which include near-ﬁeld components by abandoning the ideal
phase conjugator assumption. For simplicity our description is limited to cover only the
degenerate four-wave mixing conﬁguration for which the interacting optical ﬁelds all
have the same cyclic frequency w

.

Because of the small range of the optical evanescent ﬁelds from the (mesoscopic)
source a substantial part of the near-ﬁeld phase conjugation process is bound to take
place in the surface region of the phase conjugating medium. It is thus from the very
outset necessary to focus the attention on the surface region of the nonlinear mirror and
investigate the phase conjugation process on a length scale (much) smaller than the op-
tical wavelength. This fact in itself makes use of the ideal phase conjugator assumption
doubtful. For a bulk phase conjugator it may furthermore be difﬁcult to assure an ef-
fective nonlinear mixing in a surface layer as thin as the ﬁeld penetration depth. Thus,
experimentally it might be advantageous to use a thin ﬁlm or even a quantum well as the
nonlinear medium (see Fig. 3.1). From a different perspective the use of a thin ﬁlm as
the nonlinear medium has already drawn attention (Montemezzani and G¨unter 1996).

The present theory has been constructed in such a manner that it offers a framework
for microscopic studies of degenerate four-wave mixing at surfaces of bulk media, in
thin ﬁlms and quantum wells, and in small particles. To carry out in detail a rigorous mi-
croscopic numerical analysis of the DFWM process it is, however, necessary to consider
mesoscopic media with a particularly simple electronic structure, and we shall demon-
strate later how the present theory can be applied to a simple quantum well structure.

In conventional descriptions of optical phase conjugation by DFWM it is assumed that
the interaction length is long compared to the wavelength of the probe ﬁelds, thus build-
ing up pictorially speaking from one of the pump beams and the probe beam a grating,
from which the other pump beam is scattered into a phase conjugated replica (the ‘real-
time holography’ picture). Furthermore it is assumed that the amplitudes of the ﬁelds are
slowly varying on the optical wavelength scale [Slowly varying envelope (SVE) approx-
imation] and thus also constant across the individual scattering units (atoms, molecules,
. . . ) [Electric dipole (ED) approximation] of the phase conjugating medium. Consider-
ing optical near ﬁelds, which contain components varying rapidly in space, the afore-
mentioned approximations do not hold and we thus exclude them in the present formal-
ism. We also avoid other approximations often made in the literature, namely (i) the
assumption of a lossless medium, (ii) the ab initio requirement of phase matching be-
tween the interacting optical signals, and (iii) the assumption that the probe ﬁeld is weak
compared to the pump ﬁelds.

To illustrate the need for a theory going beyond the SVE and ED approximations,
we have in Fig. 3.2 shown the component of the probe wavevector perpendicular to
the surface, inside as well as outside the phase conjugator, as a function of its paral-
lel component. When the parallel component of the probe wavevector becomes larger
than w /c0, the perpendicular component of the wavevector becomes purely imaginary

Figure 3.1: The upper part is a schematic illustration showing the Weyl representation of a
spherical wave-ﬁeld from a point (mesoscopic) source. In this representation the ﬁeld is ex-
panded in plane waves over a plane, in practice the surface in consideration. The two-dimensional
wavevector (~qk) expansion consists of those terms for which qk ≤ w /c0 (c0 being the vacuum
speed of light) plus those having qk > w /c0. In the ﬁrst group of terms the component of the
wavevector perpendicular to the surface (vertical arrow) is real so that the individual plane-wave
modes are propagating, and in the second group, consisting of evanescent modes, this compo-
nent is purely imaginary. The solid lines attached to two of the arrows indicate planes of constant
phase, and the dotted lines attached to the evanescent modes indicate lines of constant amplitude.
The lower part is a schematic illustration showing an exponentially decaying mode from a meso-
scopic source placed near a thin ﬁlm (quantum well) phase conjugator. To phase conjugate an
evanescent mode in an effective manner the near ﬁeld of the source must overlap the phase con-
jugator, and as indicated it is not always correct to assume that the selfconsistently determined
evanescent ﬁeld is constant across the thin ﬁlm.

in the vacuum, but it is still real inside the phase conjugating mirror. A purely imagi-
nary wavevector component means that the electromagnetic ﬁeld is evanescent, whereas
a real component indicates that the ﬁeld is propagating and nondecaying (in the absense
of absorption). When the parallel component becomes larger than nw /c0 (where n is the
refractive index of the substrate) the perpendicular component of the probe wavevector
becomes evanescent also inside the phase conjugating mirror, and the larger the parallel
component, the more wrong the SVE and ED approximations become. Thus to study, for
instance, the phase conjugation of all ﬁeld components possibly emitted from a meso-
scopic source in the vicinity of the phase conjugator it is necessary to abandon these
approximations.

As already mentioned, the present theory not only allows one to investigate the optical
phase conjugation of evanescent waves with small penetration depths, it also enables one
to investigate the possibility of achieving DFWM in mesoscopic ﬁlms (quantum wells),

a subject of interest in its own right. The main reason that the present formulation may
be used in near-ﬁeld optics as well as in mesoscopic-ﬁlm electrodynamics originates in
the fact that in both cases the microscopic local-ﬁeld calculation is the crucial quantity.
A further advantage of the present theory is that it allows us to study phase conjugation
when one or more of the interacting ﬁelds are surface-wave ﬁelds.

The construction of such a theoretical model begins with the microscopic Maxwell–
Lorentz equations, which combined with the nonlocal linear and third-order nonlinear
constitutive equations are used to set up the basic wave equation for the phase conjugated
ﬁeld. The linear and nonlinear conductivity responses of the electrons will be calculated

within the framework of the random-phase-approximation theory, the starting point be-
ing the Liouville equation of motion for the density matrix operator. In the description
we include in the interaction Hamiltonian not only the standard ~p · ~A term (~p being the
momentum operator and ~A being the vector potential) but also the term proportional to
the square of the vector potential, i.e., ~A ·~A. For a monochromatic driving ﬁeld (of cyclic
frequency w
- and DC-parts, and both of these are in general im-
portant for the description of the microscopic phase conjugation process. In the current
density operator we include the term containing the vector potential. This term, needed
in order to ensure the gauge invariance of quantum electrodynamics, also turns out to be
of importance in some cases. Starting from a dipolar interaction Hamiltonian the ﬁrst
explicit microscopic derivation of the third-order conductivity (susceptibility) response
appears to be due to Bloembergen, Lotem, and Lynch Jr. (1978). The result of Bloem-
bergen, Lotem, and Lynch Jr. is based on a~r · ~E calculation and only the vector-potential
independent part of the current density operator is kept. Apart from a single study deal-
ing with the electromagnetic self-action in a BCS-paired superconductor (Keller 1995),
it seems that in all theoretical investigations of the DFWM-process in which microscopic
considerations have appeared, the Bloembergen, Lotem, and Lynch Jr. expression has
been used. We cannot use this expression here, however, since we need to address a
local-ﬁeld problem when dealing with mesoscopic interaction volumes, and such a prob-
lem necessitates that we take into account values of qk much larger than w /c0, and thus
that the calculation goes beyond the ED approximation. To account for local-ﬁeld effects
it is necessary to perform a spatially nonlocal calculation of the third-order conductivity,
and this is most adequately done beginning with the minimal coupling interaction Hamil-
tonian which contains both the ~p · ~A and ~A ·~A terms. In the local limit where the vector
potential only depends on time our expression for the nonlinear conductivity and the~r ·~E
based one of Bloembergen, Lotem, and Lynch Jr. are physically equivalent, provided the
terms stemming from the gauge conserving vector potential dependent part of the current
density operator are neglected. Though physically equivalent, the explicit forms of the
relation between the nonlinear current density and the electric ﬁeld only coincides after
having performed a relevant unitary transformation on the minimal coupling Hamilto-
nian and the related electronic wave functions. In stead of using the minimal coupling
Hamiltonian to describe the nonlocal dynamics one could in principle have used the
multipolar Hamiltonian. In practice this is less convenient for the present purpose due to
the fact that the pronounced nonlocality we sometimes are facing in mesoscopic media
would require that many multipole terms were kept in the Hamiltonian. The essentially
nonlocal terms in the nonlinear conductivity are included in our treatment because they
in certain cases—especially for very small interaction volumes—are the only contribut-
ing ones, and in other cases they dominate the phase conjugated response. Since we deal
with a spatially nonlocal description it is important to characterize the spatial structure
involved in the physical processes behind the phase conjugation, and the various phys-
ical processes hidden in the nonlinear and nonlocal constitutive equation are therefore
identiﬁed. Following the identiﬁcation of the physical processes, an expression for the
so-called conductivity response tensor describing the nonlinear material response in the

18

Part I: Motivation

DFWM process is established, and the eigensymmetries of the conductivity tensors be-
longing to each of the processes occuring in the DFWM process are discussed. Rather
than solving the full spatial problem (which would be cumbersome, if not impossible),
we consider a simpliﬁed system possessing inﬁnitesimal translational invariance in two
directions. For such a system the potential of the related Schr¨odinger equation only
varies in the direction perpendicular to the plane of translational invariance. The fun-
damental solutions to the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation are inserted into the
linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors thus giving us the framework for a theoretical
description of the DFWM process in mesoscopic ﬁlms (quantum wells) as well as for
evanescent waves. Compared to conventional descriptions of optical phase conjugation
in bulk media the concept of phase matching (momentum conservation) now appears
only in two dimensions. The lack of translational invariance in the third dimension im-
plies that no phase matching occurs in this dimension. Phase matching (in one, two or
three dimensions) is not a precondition set on our theory, it follows to the extent that the
phase conjugating medium exhibits inﬁnitesimal translational invariance. Despite the
fact that the phase matching is lost in the third dimension, phase conjugation may still
take place in quantum wells and thin ﬁlms, and with evanescent ﬁelds, just as second
harmonic generation can occur in quantum-well systems, at metallic (and semiconduct-
ing) surfaces and from nonlinear (sub)monolayer ﬁlms deposited on linear substrates
(Richmond, Robinson, and Shannon 1988). To complete our local-ﬁeld calculation of
the optical phase conjugation by degenerate four-wave mixing in mesoscopic interaction
volumes, we use a Green’s function formalism to establish new integral equations for the
phase conjugated ﬁeld in the general case, and in the case where the nonlinear medium
exhibits translational invariance in two dimensions. The microscopic local-ﬁeld theory
thus established is then used to describe the DFWM in one- and two-level quantum-well
phase conjugators.

The electromagnetic ﬁeld

In this chapter a description of the electromagnetic ﬁeld from a phase conjugating medi-
um is established, starting from the microscopic Maxwell equations. First, we derive
the relevant wave equation for the phase conjugated ﬁeld. The ﬁeld–matter interaction
is then described through the use of constitutive relations. In the ﬁnal step of this basic
framework, a self-consistent description of the phase conjugated ﬁeld is established.

4.1 Wave equation for the phase conjugated ﬁeld

As a starting point we take the microscopic Maxwell-Lorentz equations, in which the
material response at the space-time point (~r,t) is completely described via the micro-
scopic current density ~J(~r,t), and the related charge density, r (~r,t). They are

the lowest order nonlinear interaction dominates over higher order mixing processes.

4.2 Constitutive relations for the current densities

−w (~r ) and ~J (3)

To close the loop for the calculation of the phase conjugated ﬁeld, the microscopic cur-
rent densities ~J (1)
−w (~r ) are given in terms of the local electric ﬁeld through
constitutive relations describing the ﬁeld–matter interaction in a perturbative manner.
Choosing a gauge where the time-dependent part of the scalar potential is zero, the elec-
tric ﬁeld is related to the vector potential via ~E(~r ) = iw ~A(~r ). Thus the microscopic
current densities can be related via the constitutive relations to the vector potentials of
the phase conjugated ﬁeld (~APC) and the ﬁelds driving the process (~A ). The linear con-
stitutive relation we therefore write in the form

By inserting Eqs. (4.9) and (4.10), with ~APC = ~EPC/(iw ), into Eq. (4.8) the loop for the
phase conjugated ﬁeld is closed.

4.3 The phase conjugated ﬁeld

From the outset we assume that the parametric approximation can be adopted, i.e., we
assume that the generated phase conjugated ﬁeld does not affect the dynamics of the
pump and signal ﬁelds. In the present case, where the phase conjugated ﬁeld originates
mainly in evanescent modes or from a quantum well, the interaction volume is small and
the magnitude of the phase conjugated ﬁeld thus very limited so that one may expect
the parametric approximation to be quite good. The inherent spatial nonlocality of the
processes which underlies the microscopic calculation of the local ﬁelds and currents is
crucial and must be kept throughout the following analysis.

Above we used the microscopic Maxwell-Lorentz equations to establish a wave equa-
tion [Eq. (4.8)] for the phase conjugated electric ﬁeld. Since this equation holds not only
inside the phase conjugator but also in the medium possibly in contact with the phase
conjugator, it is adequate to divide the linear part of the induced current density into two,
i.e.,

~J(~r ) = ~Jcont(~r; w ) + ~J (1)

PC (~r; w ),

(4.12)

where ~Jcont(~r; w ) is the linear current density of the medium in contact (cont) with the
phase conjugator, and ~J (1)
PC (~r; w ) is the linear current density of the phase conjugator. In
setting up the above-mentioned equation we have implicitly assumed that there is no
(signiﬁcant) electronic overlap between the phase conjugator and the contact medium.
The two electron distributions can still be electromagnetically coupled, of course. In the
quantum well case, ~Jcont(~r; w ) is to be identiﬁed as the current density induced in the
(assumed linear) response of the substrate. To deal with the evanescent response of a
(semiinﬁnite) phase conjugator one just puts ~Jcont(~r; w ) =~0.

Instead of proceeding directly with the differential equation [Eq. (4.8)] for the phase
conjugated local ﬁeld we convert it into an integral relation between the phase conjugated
electric ﬁeld and the prevailing current density, namely

~EPC(~r; w ) = ~E ext

PC (~r; w ) − iµ0w

with Eq. (4.13) as it stands, if possible, it is often advantageous to eliminate the cur-
rent density of the contact medium in favour of a so-called pseudo-vacuum (or contact-
medium) propagator, G(~r,~r ′; w ). Doing this, one obtains

the background ﬁeld can be calculated from the integral relation

In the parametric approximation adopted here the background ﬁeld can be considered as
a prescribed quantity. By inserting the linear constitutive equation

~J (1)
PC (~r; w ) =

s (~r,~r ′; w ) · ~EPC(~r ′; w )d3r′

into Eq. (4.14) one obtains the following integral equation for the phase conjugated ﬁeld:

~EPC(~r; w ) = ~E B

PC(~r; w ) − iµ0w

G(~r,~r ′′; w ) · s (~r ′′,~r ′; w ) · ~EPC(~r ′; w )d3r′′d3r′.(4.17)

The formal solution of this equation is given by

Z Z

~EPC(~r; w ) =

G (~r,~r ′; w ) · ~E B

PC(~r ′; w )d3r′,

where the nonlocal ﬁeld-ﬁeld response tensor G (~r,~r ′; w ) is to be derived from the dyadic
integral equation

G (~r,~r ′; w ) = 1

is the kernel of the integral equation in Eq. (4.17). This kernel formally is identical to
the one playing a prominent role in the electrodynamics of mesoscopic media and small
particles [see Keller (1996a), section 4].

By inserting Eq. (4.15) into Eq. (4.18) and thereafter making use of Eq. (4.10), the
phase conjugated ﬁeld may in principle be calculated from known quantities. In practice
it is not so easy, since the integral equation in Eq. (4.17) for the phase conjugated ﬁeld
in general is too difﬁcult to handle numerically even if rather simple linear conductivity
response tensors are used, the reason being the inherent three-dimensional (~r ) nature of
the problem. One therefore has to resort to one sort of approximation or another. Just
as in other linear and nonlinear studies of mesoscopic media, or media with a small
interaction volume, a tractable problem is obtained if the medium in question possesses
translational invariance in two directions as discussed in Part III.

Single-electron current density response

In this chapter the Liouville equation of motion for the single-body density matrix op-
erator is used together with the single-particle Hamiltonian to establish a more general
quantum mechanical expression for the third-order current density than those hitherto
found in the literature. The generalisation is of signiﬁcant importance for the theory of
near-ﬁeld phase conjugation and for DFWM in mesoscopic ﬁlms. Following the deriva-
tion of the linear and the DFWM responses, we end this chapter by a discussion of the
underlying physical processes.

5.1 Density matrix operator approach

The starting point for this calculation is the Liouville equation of motion for the single-
body density matrix operator r

sents the irreversible coupling to the “surroundings”, and “H.a.” denotes the Hermitian
adjoint. Although the spin and spin-orbit dynamics may be included in the formalism in
a reasonably simple fashion we have omitted to do so because spin effects are judged to
be signiﬁcant only for nonlinear phenomena of even order. Hence

5.2 Linear response

Because of its usefulness for a subsequent comparison to the forced DFWM current
density we ﬁrst present the well known result for the linear response (Feibelman 1975,
1982). Thus, by using the expressions for the current density [Eq. (5.10)] and density
matrix [Eq. (5.8)] operators it is realised that the linear current density is to be obtained

Though quite complicated in its appearence the expression for the driving current density
of the DFWM process is needed in order to understand the near-ﬁeld phase conjugation
process from a general point of view.1 Special scattering conﬁgurations of course can
lead to analytical simpliﬁcations of the general result. The above result also enables us to
establish a microscopic theory for DFWM in quantum wells and thin ﬁlms as described
in Parts III, IV, and V.

5.4 Physical processes underlying the current densities

To gain insight into the physics underlying the nonlinear constitutive equation, given
implicitly in Eqs. (5.18)–(5.20), we next discuss the processes connecting in a nonlocal
fashion the current density at a given point in space to the ﬁeld points of the surroundings.
To facilitate the understanding of the nonlinear response we start by a brief summary of
the linear response.

1With respect to the result published in Andersen and Keller (1998) the last sum in Eq. (5.20) above
is written in a more compact form than in Eq. (22) of Andersen and Keller (1998). The compact form in
Eq. (5.20) is obtained by exchanging indices v and l in the last three terms of Andersen and Keller (1998),
Eq. (22). As a consequence of this, the same difference occur between Eqs. (6.14) and (8.23) and Eqs. (34)
and (51) of Andersen and Keller (1998), respectively.

The electrodynamic coupling connecting a source point for the ﬁeld to an observation
point for the current density associated to each of the two linear processes underly-
ing Eqs. (5.14) and (5.15) is adequately illustrated in diagrammatic form as shown in
Fig. 5.1.

Hence, Fig. 5.1.A represents a picture of the well known diamagnetic process origi-

process stemming from the term H (1)

5.4.2 Nonlinear part

In the DFWM process, the coupling between the three source points for the ﬁeld and the
observation point for the current density, described in Eqs. (5.18)–(5.20), can be pictured
in diagrammatic form as shown in Fig. 5.2.

At this stage it is fruitful to compare the nonlocal result for the DFWM current density,
shown in diagrammatic form in Fig. 5.2, with the commonly used standard (textbook)
result. In the standard description all diamagnetic effects are neglected from the outset.
The diamagnetic process is hidden in the diagrams containing a closed loop, cf. Fig. 5.1.
This means that all the processes depicted in Figs. 5.2.A–5.2.D are absent in the stan-
dard description. Omission of diamagnetic effects in the nonlinear optics of quantum
wells and in mesoscopic near-ﬁeld optics is known to be dangerous (Keller 1996a), and
thus we cannot omit these terms here. We shall substantiate on this point later. Also the
interaction channels given by the diagrams in Figs. 5.2.E and 5.2.F are absent in text-
book formulations. This is so because simultaneous two-photon processes originating
in the ~A · ~A part of the interaction Hamiltonian are left out from the beginning. These
processes however are known to be important in mesoscopic electrodynamics and can
not be omitted a priori. In the local limit the result given by the diagram in Fig. 5.2.G

is identical to the ~r · ~E dipolar interaction Hamiltonian, since a unitary transformation
of the form S = exp(−ie~A(t) ·~r/~) performed on the wave functions and the minimal
coupling Hamiltonian would display the equivalence of the two formalisms (Ackerhalt
and Milonni 1984; Milonni, Cook, and Ackerhalt 1989).

Conductivity tensors for DFWM response

In the preceding two chapters, we have found expressions for the phase conjugated ﬁeld
and the single-electron current density response. In the present chapter the connection
between the single-electron current densities [Eqs. (5.13) and (5.17)] and their related
conductivity tensors [Eqs. (4.9) and (4.10)] is established. First, the matrix elements
of the Hamiltonian and the current density operator are written in terms of the vector
potential. Then the symmetries of the various contributions to the conductivity tensors
are studied. Finally, the expressions for the nonzero and independent elements of the
conductivity tensors are written on explicit form.

6.1 General considerations

In order to determine (i) the linear conductivity response tensor s (~r,~r ′) introduced in
Eq. (4.9) from the expression for the linear current density in Eq. (5.13) [with inser-
tion of Eqs. (5.14) and (5.15)], and (ii) the nonlinear conductivity response function
X (~r,~r ′,~r ′′,~r ′′′) introduced in Eq. (4.10) from the expression for the DFWM current den-
sity given in Eq. (5.17) [with Eqs. (5.18)–(5.20) inserted] we by now essentially just need
to relate the various matrix elements appearing in Eqs. (5.14), (5.15), and (5.18)–(5.20)
to the vector potential.

is linear in the vector potential one ﬁnds on integral form

The calculation of the DFWM conductivity tensor is ﬁnalized in two steps. Thus
we start by inserting Eqs. (6.1)–(6.5) into the three traces in Eqs. (5.18)–(5.20), and
thereafter we extract the vector potential in such a manner that the result takes the general
form given in Eq. (4.10). For convenience, we in the following divide the nonlinear
conductivity tensor into a sum of subparts A–G referring to the processes (A)–(G) shown
in Fig. 5.2.

Since we are using the linear response function in the description of the phase conju-
gated ﬁeld it is adequate for consistency again to describe the linear process, although
it is already well known. The calculation is done in a similar manner as for the DFWM
response, by inserting Eqs. (6.1), (6.2) and (6.5) into the two traces in Eqs. (5.14) and
(5.15), and thereafter isolating the vector potential so that the result takes the form of
Eq. (4.9). In the following the linear conductivity tensor is divided into a sum of sub-
parts A–B referring to the two processes shown in Fig. 5.1.

transition current density and a vector potential and that those of H (2)
involve
inner products between two vector potentials, see Eqs. (6.3) and (6.4). These last inner
products may conveniently be written in the form 1 : ~A~A and 1 : ~A~A∗, respectively. The
matrix elements of the current densities ~j (1)
are directly proportional to the
−w
vector potential and may thus for the present purpose adequately be written in the forms
1 ·~A and 1 ·~A∗, respectively.

elements.

have 3 nonzero elements. Furthermore, of these 3 nonzero elements only 1 is indepen-
dent, since the Cartesian index of the linear current density follows that of the vector
potential appearing in ~j (1)
, and thus i = j. The other part of the linear conductivity ten-
sor (part B) is extracted from Eq. (5.15), and it shows a symmetry to the outer product
~J1 ⊗ ~J2, where ~J1 and ~J2 in general are different, and part B of the linear conductivity
tensor thus has 9 independent nonzero elements. The symmetry schemes of the linear
conductivity tensor are shown in Fig. 6.1.

6.2.2 DFWM conductivity tensor

Taking our symmetry analysis to the DFWM conductivity tensor we conclude that part
A, given by the ﬁrst sum on the right hand side of Eq. (5.18), has a symmetry given
by the outer product 1 ⊗ 1. Part A thus have 9 nonzero elements. Furthermore, since
the Cartesian index of the DFWM current density follows that of the vector potential
appearing in ~j (1)
, i = j in the index notation of Eq. (4.11). From the form of the H (2)
−2w
term we next conclude that k = h. Altogether it is realised that the 9 nonzero elements
are identical. To get an overview of the conclusion, we show in Fig. 6.2.A the result in
terms of a symmetry scheme.

Utilising the same type of arguments it is concluded that each term in the second sum
in Eq. (5.18), which gives rise to part B of the conductivity tensor, when written in the
form of Eq. (4.11) has a symmetry identical to the outer product 1 ⊗ ~J1 ⊗ ~J2, where ~J1 and
~J2 are two generally different transition current densities. The form of this outer product
leaves us with 27 nonzero elements. Also here the coordinate convention of Eq. (4.11)
implies that i = j. Furthermore we observe that elements with i = x, i = y, and i = z
are identical, since the two H (1)
terms essentially produces numbers. Finally, we see
−w
that the independent nature of the two H (1)
terms makes them interchangeable, and thus
−w
gives us two different ways of constructing the sum in Eq. (4.11). Of the 27 nonzero
elements only 9 are independent, since as we have realised, X B

permutations of k and h in the three Cartesian coordinates {x, y, z}. Expressed in terms
of a symmetry scheme, the deductions above lead to the symmetry scheme shown in
Fig. 6.2.B.

Table 6.1: The tensor symmetries of the various parts A–B of the linear, and A–G of the DFWM
conductivity. As explained in the text, ~J1–~J4 are four in general different vectors obtained by a
weighted superposition of single-particle transition current densities, and ~eA = ~A/A.

this is proportional to (1 : ~A~A∗)~A, a fact which in relation to the form given in Eq. (4.11)
implies that the symmetry of the conductivity tensor is given by the outer product ~eA ⊗
1 ⊗~eA, with ~eA = ~A/A. This product form leaves us with 9 nonzero elements. As far
as the Cartesian indices are concerned the above symmetry implies that j = h and i = k.
Finally we observe that the same constant appears in front of the vector potential indexed
k. This leads to the conclusion that the cases i = x, i = y, and i = z are equal, leaving at
the end only one independent nonzero element of part C of the conductivity tensor. The
symmetry scheme for part C is shown in Fig. 6.2.C.

In the second sum of Eq. (5.19) the symmetry is proportional to the outer product
~eA ⊗ ~J1 ⊗ ~J2 ⊗~eA and thus we are left with 27 nonzero elements. Then, in the form of
Eq. (4.11), i = h, and the permutations over i are seen to be equal, so that we end up with
only 9 independent elements. Using the fact that X D
z jkz one obtains the
symmetry scheme shown in Fig. 6.2.D.

x jkx = X D

y jky = X D

Let us now take a closer look at the third trace in Eq. (5.20). It is convenient to split the
ﬁrst sum in this equation into two parts related to the two different processes that occur.
The ﬁrst part of the sum, which refers to the H (2)
,vm-type of terms, gives rise to
−2w
part E of the third order conductivity tensor corresponding to process (E) of Fig. 5.2.
The second part of the ﬁrst sum is related to part F of the third order conductivity tensor
[process (F) of Fig. 5.2]. Finally, the second sum on the right side of Eq. (5.20) produces
part G of the third order conductivity tensor, corresponding to process (G) of Fig. 5.2.

,nvH (1)

The ﬁrst part of the ﬁrst sum, in relation to the representation in Eq. (4.11), has a
symmetry which can be represented by the outer product ~J1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ ~J2, leaving 27 nonzero
elements. From the term H (2)
, we see that k = h in the chosen representation of coordi-
−2w
nate sets, and furthermore we realise that elements with k = x, k = y, and k = z are equal.
These deductions reduce the number of independent nonzero elements to 9, which ful-

{x, y, z}. The result is shown on schematic form in terms of the symmetry scheme in
Fig. 6.2.E.

In the second part of the ﬁrst sum in Eq. (5.20) we observe that the symmetry of
part F of the conductivity tensor, in relation to the form of Eq. (4.11), is proportional
to the outer product ~J1 ⊗ ~J2 ⊗ 1, again leaving 27 nonzero elements. Due to the chosen
convention of the coordinate sets, we realise from the H (2)
term that the condition k = j
applies. We furthermore notice from this that terms with j = x, j = y, and j = z are
equal, leaving 9 independent nonzero elements related by X F
izzh for all
permutations of i and h in the three Cartesian coordinates {x, y, z}. This means that the
symmetry scheme is as shown in Fig. 6.2.F.

ixxh = X F

iyyh = X F

Part G of the third order conductivity tensor, which originates in the second sum in
Eq. (5.20), obviously has the tensor form ~J1 ⊗ ~J2 ⊗ ~J3 ⊗ ~J4, and there will hence in general
be 81 independent nonzero elements in the associated symmetry scheme.

The considerations laying the foundations for the symmetry schemes of the various
parts of the linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors are displayed in Tab. 6.1, where the
relevant combinations of ~J’s and 1’s are given.

6.3 Expressions for the conductivity tensors

We end this chapter by giving the explicit expressions for the independent tensor ele-
ments of s (~r,~r ′) and X (~r,~r ′,~r ′′,~r ′′′). Thus, the only independent tensor element in part
A of the linear conductivity tensor is

In Chapters 4–6 we have established a spatially nonlocal theoretical model for optical
phase conjugation in mesoscopic media. The comparison to the existing (local) descrip-
tions of the degenerate four-wave mixing response can be made by taking the local limit
of our nonlocal response tensor and abandoning the contributions stemming from the
microscopic current density of ﬁrst order in ~A.

In the local limit, the amplitudes of the interacting vector potentials are assumed not
to vary with the spatial coordinates, and thus the expressions for the nonlocal DFWM
conductivity tensor can be integrated over the ~r ′′′, ~r ′′, and ~r ′ spaces to obtain the local
DFWM conductivity tensor, i.e.,

X (~r) =

X (~r,~r ′,~r ′′,~r ′′′)d3r′′′d3r′′d3r′.

(7.2)

where d nm is the Kronecker delta. The integrals over the current densities gives zero if
the two quantum numbers are identical, otherwise they depend on the individual wave
functions. The consequences are the following: (i) Integration over the spatial coordi-
nates ~r ′′′ and ~r ′′ in Eq. (6.8) gives n = m, and thus fn = fm, such that part A of the
DFWM conductivity tensor vanish. (ii) In part C, given by Eq. (6.10), the effect is sim-
ilar, but is here obtained after integration over ~r ′′′,~r ′′, and ~r ′. (iii) In part E, integration
over~r ′′′ and~r ′′ in Eq. (6.12) makes two terms disappear immediately, and an inspection
of the remaining two terms shows that they are of equal magnitude, but with opposite
sign, ultimately cancelling the rest of part E. (iv) In part F, integration over~r ′′′ and~r ′ in
Eq. (6.13) gives a result similar in consequences as for part E. Thus, parts A, C, E, and F
of the DFWM conductivity tensor are inherently nonlocal, while parts B, D, and G also
contributes to the response in the local limit.

Abandoning parts B and D of the DFWM conductivity tensor because they are based
on the response of the microscopic current density of ﬁrst order in ~A, we conclude that
only the local contribution from part G is included in the previous descriptions of the
DFWM response (Bloembergen, Lotem, and Lynch Jr. 1978), as postulated on page 30.

Part II: Microscopic model for DFWM

The single-electron model for degenerate four-wave mixing established in the previ-
ous chapters can be used to study the four-wave mixing response from a number of dif-
ferent materials. For example, one could study (i) systems built from molecules or atoms
with no electronic overlap (dielectrics), in which case the response from each molecule
(atom) can be found separately. The coupling between the individual molecules would
then be described using electromagnetic propagators. Another approach (ii) can be taken
for studies of the response from metals, where a number of electrons from each ion in
the metallic structure is shared with the other ions in a free-electron-like cloud, or (iii)
one could study semiconductors, in which the behaviour of the electrons are strongly
coupled.

In the present work, we will concentrate on the metallic case, and we proceed to
give a simpliﬁed description of potential interest for DFWM in mesoscopic ﬁlms and in
near-ﬁeld optics.

DFWM in two-dimensionally translational invariant media

After having established and analyzed the DFWM conductivity response in its most gen-
eral form we now turn the attention towards the speciﬁc case in which the medium under
consideration effectively exhibits translational invariance in two directions, say x and y
in a Cartesian (x, y, z) coordinate system. We study such a case because it appears to
be of particular importance for optical phase conjugation (i) in mesoscopic ﬁlms (quan-
tum wells), and (ii) related to evanescent waves in near-ﬁeld optics. In neither of these
cases a microscopic theory exists today to our knowledge. For mesoscopic ﬁlms the
dynamics perpendicular to the ﬁlm plane (here, the x-y-plane) has to be treated from a
microscopic nonlocal point of view, whereas the dynamics in the plane of the ﬁlm often
is well modelled by a local conductivity (dielectric) function. In the following we as-
sume for simplicity that the electron motion in the plane of the ﬁlm is free-electron-like.
It is possible to replace the free-electron-like behaviour with extended Bloch-function
(or tight-binding) dynamics if necessary but we shall not do this here, since after all,
in the local limit only matrix elements are changed in the oscillator model when the
In the optical near-
free-electron dynamics is replaced by a more complicated one.
ﬁeld case where evanescent waves with extremely small penetration depths in say the
z-direction appear, it is crucial to keep the microscopic dynamics perpendicular to the
surface of the phase conjugating mirror when calculating the DFWM response. So far,
four-wave mixing in media with two-dimensional translational invariance has only been
studied in the context of phase conjugation of electromagnetic surface waves (Fukui,
Sipe, So, and Stegeman 1978; Ujihara 1982a, 1982b), and of a bulk wave by surface
waves (Zel’dovich, Pilipetskii, Sudarkin, and Shkunov 1980; Ujihara 1983; Stegeman
and Karaguleff 1983; Nunzi and Ricard 1984; Mamaev, Mel’nikov, Pilipetski˘ı, Su-
darkin, and Shkunov 1984; Mukhin, Pilipetski˘ı, Sudarkin, and Ushakov 1985; Arutyun-
yan and Dzhotyan 1987; Pilipetski˘ı, Sudarkin, and Ushakov 1987). In these investiga-
tions macroscopic approaches was used.

8.1 General DFWM response

The assumed two-dimensional translational invariance against displacements parallel to
the x-y-plane makes it natural to express the various vector and tensor quantities in a

45

46

Part III: DFWM in quantum well structures

mixed Fourier representation. Thus, by a Fourier analysis in the x- and y-coordinates,
the vector potential is

~A(z,~rk) =

~A(z;~qk)ei~qk·~rkd2qk,

(2p )2

Z

~J (a )
−w (z;~qk) =

~J (a )
−w (z,~rk)e−i~qk·~rk d2rk.

where ~qk = (qx, qy, 0) and ~rk = (x, y, 0). Likewise, the inverse relation reads for the
current density of order a and linear in the cyclic frequency w

In the mixed Fourier representation the relevant constitutive relations takes the form

Due to the manner in which the nonlinear conductivity response tensor was constructed
in Chapter 5, the various components parallel to the x-y-plane are not completely inde-
pendent but satisfy the momentum conservation criterion

~q′′′
k +~q′′

k −~q′

k −~qk =~0.

In passing we stress again that Eq. (8.5) is not an extra condition put on the dynamics,
the equation is derived from the general theory [see Appendix A]. To study the phase
conjugated response originating in the mixing of three incoming waves one must choose
for the ﬁelds of the two pump waves, denoted by (1) and (2), the vector potentials with
the double and triple primes in Eq. (8.4). The incoming probe ﬁeld [indexed (p)] is
represented via the vector potential with the single prime.

8.2 Phase conjugation DFWM response

So far, we have not utilized the translational invariance condition on the properties of
the medium. We do this ﬁrst indirectly by assuming that each of the three incoming
electromagnetic ﬁelds contains only one plane-wave component parallel to the x-y-plane.
Further limiting our study to the case where the DFWM response becomes the phase
conjugated response, i.e., the wavevector of the response must be counterpropagating to
the probe ﬁeld, conservation of pseudomomentum requires that the two pump ﬁelds are
counterpropagating. Thus we take for the pump ﬁelds

~A(z′′′;~q′′′
~A(z′′;~q′′

k ) ≡ ~A(z′′′; −~kk)d (~q′′′

where~kk is the common wavevector for the two pump ﬁelds. With these substitutions we
can perform the integrals over q′′′
k in Eq. (8.4), and the conservation of pseudo-
momentum is reduced from its general degenerate four-wave mixing form, ~q′′′
k +~q′′
k −
k +~qk =~0. This allows us also to solve the integral over q′
k −~qk =~0, to ~q′
~q′
k in Eq. (8.4).
In relation to the conventional theory of three-dimensional (bulk) phase conjugation,
k +~qk =~0 expresses the fact that the two-dimensional wavevector ~qk of the
the relation ~q′
phase conjugated ﬁeld is equal in magnitude to the two-dimensional probe wavevector
(~q′
k) but points in the opposite direction. Using the aforementioned criteria, the nonlinear
constitutive equation is reduced to the form

k , ~q′′

k , and ~q′

where appropriate integration over ~q′′′
k has been performed. The term “i.t.”
denotes the so-called “interchanged term”. This term is obtained from the ﬁrst one by
interchanging the two pump ﬁelds. The reason that such a term has to be added arises
from the fact that each of the vector potentials basically consists of a sum of all three
incoming ﬁelds, and that the phase conjugated term from the product of the three vector
potentials thus must include both permutations of the pump ﬁelds. The new phase con-
jugation DFWM (PCDFWM) conductivity tensor appearing after integration over ~q′′′

In order to calculate the nonlinear conductivity tensor X (z, z′, z′′, z′′′;~qk,~kk) in the
mixed Fourier representation [as well as the linear one, s (z, z′;~qk)], we begin by look-
ing at the energy eigenstates for the light-unperturbed Schr¨odinger equation. Hence,
since the potential energy of the individual electrons is independent of x and y, i.e.,
V (~r ) = V (z) under our translational invariance assumption, the basis set may be taken
in the generic form

k is denoted X (z, z′, z′′, z′′′;~qk,~kk).

where ~k
k = (k x, k y, 0) is the wavevector describing the free-particle motion perpen-
dicular to the z-direction. For a medium of macroscopic extension in the x- and y-
directions, the set of wavevectors commonly denoted by ~k
k forms a two-dimensional
quasi-continuum. Albeit the index n in the wave function y n(z,~rk) stands for a triple set
of quantum numbers we also use this index to classify the various wave function parts,
y n(z), belonging to the single indexed z-dynamics. In a readily understandable notation

8.3 Conductivity tensors

The explicit expression for the phase conjugation degenerate four-wave mixing (PCD-
FWM) conductivity tensor X (z, z′, z′′, z′′′;~qk,~kk) is calculated by insertion of (i) the so-
lutions to the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation given in Eq. (8.9), (ii) the Fourier
representation of the vector potential given by Eq. (8.1), and (iii) the new form of the
transition current given in Eq. (8.14) into the nonlinear DFWM constitutive relation
in Eq. (4.10) with the phase conjugation conductivity tensor in real space given by
Eqs. (6.8)–(6.14), and thereafter inserting the outcome of these steps into the expres-
sion for the nonlinear current density in the mixed Fourier representation in Eq. (8.2).

Finally, we perform the integrals over the two dimensions (x and y) in real space and
over relevant sets of ~k
k-states. Altogether we are left with an expression on the form of
Eq. (8.8). For the processes in Figs. 5.1 and 5.2, the abovementioned calculations are

attention to the phase conjugated electric ﬁeld. In the present case where the main parts
of the interaction takes place in very small interaction volumes, we can expect that the
generated phase conjugated ﬁeld does not affect the dynamics of the pump and probe
ﬁelds much, and thus take the parametric approximation.

Then the loop equation in Eq. (4.17) is reduced to the single-coordinate form in the

two-dimensional phase matching case (Keller 1996a)

possibly with G(z, z′′;~qk, w ) replaced by G0(z, z′′;~qk, w ). In the quantum-well case the
explicit form of G(z, z′′;~qk, w ) is known (Bagchi, Barrera, and Rajagopal 1979), and also
G0(z, z′′;~qk, w ), adequate in near-ﬁeld optics, is of course known. For few (one, two,
three, . . . )-level quantum wells several schemes exist for the handling of the integral
equation problem in Eq. (8.24), cf., e.g., Keller (1996a). The only factor which in the
parametric approximation makes the DFWM loop problem different from those hitherto
investigated is the background ﬁeld. In the present case this is given by

In the quantum well case, the pseudo-vacuum propagator G(z, z′′;~qk, w ) can be written

as a sum of three terms

G(z, z′;~qk, w ) = D(z − z′;~qk, w ) + I (z + z′;~qk, w ) + g(z − z′; w ),

(8.26)

where the ﬁrst two are named after the processes they describe. Thus the term D(z −
z′;~qk, w ) describes the direct propagation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld from a source point
at z′ to the observation point at z. It is given by
eiq⊥|z−z′|
2iq⊥

~ey ⊗~ey + Q (z − z′)~ei ⊗~ei + Q (z′ − z)~er ⊗~er

D(z − z′;~qk, w ) =

The indirect term, I (z + z′;~qk, w ), describes the propagation from the source point of the
part of the electromagnetic ﬁeld that is going to the point of observation via the surface
of the bulk medium. The expression for the indirect term reads

(cid:3)

I (z + z′;~qk, w ) =

[rs~ey ⊗~ey + rp~er ⊗~ei] .

Finally, the self-ﬁeld term characterizes the ﬁeld generated at the observation point by
the current density at the same point. The self-ﬁeld part of the propagator is given by

g(z − z′; w ) = q−2d (z − z′)~ez ⊗~ez,

(8.29)
where q = w /c0 is the vacuum wavenumber. In the above equations, q⊥ = [q2 − q2
k]1/2,
~ei = q−1(q⊥, 0, −qk), and ~er = q−1(−q⊥, 0, −qk), taking ~qk = qk~ex. The quantities rs
and rp are the amplitude reﬂection coefﬁcients of the vacuum/substrate interface in the

propagators for a single quantum well system are shown in Fig. 8.1.

8.5 Some limits of the PCDFWM conductivity tensor

8.5.1 Local limit in the z-coordinates

In the local limit the three interacting ﬁelds are independent of the z-coordinate, and thus
we may calculate the local PCDFWM response tensor as

X (z;~qk,~kk) =

X (z, z′, z′′, z′′′;~qk,~kk)dz′′′dz′′dz′.

ZZ Z

Since the dependence on the three coordinates z′′′, z′′, and z′ are fairly simple we may
draw some conclusions directly from looking at Eqs. (8.17)–(8.23). Using an orthogonal
set of wave functions, parity teaches

Figure 8.1: The propagators appearing in the calculation of the phase conjugated ﬁeld in the
system we consider in this communication. The system consists of a three layer thin ﬁlm struc-
ture, namely vacuum, ﬁlm (quantum well, extending from 0 to −d) and substrate (crosshatched).
In the vacuum may be placed different kinds of sources, e.g., a quantum wire with its axis along
the y-direction (shown as a dot). In Fig. (a) the propagation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld from
a source point~r ′ inside the quantum well to an observation point ~r outside the quantum well is
shown, while in (b) the propagation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is illustrated in the case where
both source and observation point are inside the quantum well. D is the propagation path de-
scribed by the direct propagator, I is the propagation path described by the indirect propagator,
and g denotes the self-ﬁeld action propagator. In the center of the ﬁgure is shown the Cartesian
coordinate system used in our calculations.

where d nm is the Kronecker delta. By inspection of Eq. (8.14), this is the type of integral
appearing when considering the x and y coordinates of this current density.

Then we may conclude that (i) the only independent element of part A of the PCD-
FWM conductivity tensor is zero in the local limit, since the two Fermi-Dirac distribution
functions in Eq. (8.17) becomes identical for n = m. This occurs when taking the local
limit in the coordinate z′′. In addition, (ii) the ﬁve independent elements of part E of the
PCDFWM conductivity tensor also becomes zero, since the two pure interband terms are
zero by themselves, and the two other terms are of the same magnitude but with opposite
sign. This occurs when taking the local limit in the coordinates z′′′ and z′′. Furthermore,
(iii) for part G of the PCDFWM conductivity tensor, elements with the Cartesian index
i = z and the other indices different from z becomes zero, since the other indices implies
that all quantum numbers in the summation become identical. Finally, (iv) the only in-
dependent element of part C of the PCDFWM conductivity tensor is reduced to a pure
intraband contribution. The same reduction appears in tensor elements of parts D, F,
and G with no Cartesian coordinate index z in indices jk, ih, and i jkh, respectively. In
part B of the PCDFWM conductivity tensor, the elements with no Cartesian index z in
kh apparantly gives the same result, but the following integration over ~k
k makes them
vanish. These conclusions are shown in the form of symmetry schemes in Fig. 8.2.

Figure 8.2: Symmetry schemes for the PCDFWM conductivity tensor parts B, D, F, and G in
(i) the local limit in the z coordinates, and (ii) the single level quantum well case. In the local
limit, tensor elements labeled with a “•” gives nonzero mixed interband/intraband contributions,
elements labeled with a “◦” gives nonzero pure intraband contributions, and elements labeled
with a “·” are zero. In the single level quantum well case, only elements labeled with a “◦”
contributes to the solution. The solid lines connect equal nonzero elements.

8.5.2 Local limit along the surface

Taking the local limit along the surface coordinates, the wavenumbers are considered
to be much less than the Fermi wavenumber, i.e., we take the limit where ~qk →~0 and
~kk →~0 (the dipole limit).

Then from Eq. (8.11) we observe that the transition frequencies become independent
of ~k
k, and thus we conclude that this approximation makes the integration over ~k
k par-
ticularly simple in the low temperature limit, since no integration variables appears in
any of the denominators in Eqs. (8.17)–(8.23). We further observe that only interband

Chapter 8: DFWM in 2-D translational invariant media

55

contributions are left compared to the full description.

8.5.3 Local limit in three coordinates

Locality in all three coordinates is achieved by a combination of the two limits mentioned
in Secs. 8.5.1 and 8.5.2 above. Thus, in this limit (i) parts A and E of the DFWM
conductivity tensor does not contribute for the same reasons as before. Furthermore (ii)
the integration over z′ in part C makes this part vanish, (iii) the integration over z′ in part
F of the DFWM conductivity tensor cancels two terms, and the other two are of the same
magnitude, but with opposite signs, resulting in the fact that part F does not contribute to
the response in this limit. Finally (iv), all purely intraband contributing tensor elements
found in the local limit vanish. All in all we are left with ﬁve independent nonzero
elements of parts B and D, and ﬁftyseven independent nonzero elements of G, all labeled
with a “•” in Fig. 8.2.

8.5.4 Single level quantum well

A substantial simpliﬁcation of Eqs. (8.17)–(8.23) occur in one special case, namely in
the case where the thin ﬁlm is a single level quantum well in the z-direction. In the single
level quantum well, the summation indices are all equal to 1.

Special attention is in this case devoted to the current density deﬁned in Eq. (8.14),

which in a single level quantum well is reduced to

jh,11(z; k h) = −

(d hx + d hy)k h|y 1(z)|2,

e~
2me

(8.32)

for h ∈ {x, y}, since the z-dependent part vanish for any n = m. This observation leads
to a drastic reduction of the number of contributing elements in most of the symmetry
schemes associated with the occuring processes.

The only nonzero element in part A of the nonlinear conductivity tensor vanish for
n = m. In part B of the conductivity tensor all elements with k or h equal to z vanish for
n = m = v, and the rest of the elements vanish by integration over ~k
k. The only nonzero
element of part C of the nonlinear conductivity tensor is conserved, but simpliﬁed. Part
D of the nonlinear conductivity tensor is reduced somewhat, since either combination of
j = z or k = z gives zero. Then we are left with four nonzero independent elements, as
shown in Fig. 8.2.D. Part E does not give any contributions to the intraband transitions,
since two terms in the sum gives no intraband contributions in general, and the other two
terms cancel each other. Part F is reduced in a manner similar to parts B and D, since
any combination of i = z or h = z gives zero. The resulting four nonzero independent
elements are shown in Fig. 8.2.F. In the last part (G) of the nonlinear conductivity tensor
any combination of i = z, j = z, k = z, or h = z gives zero. As a consequence of this rather
drastic reduction we are left with sixteen nonzero elements, as shown in Fig. 8.2.G.

Polarized light in the x-z-plane

Restricting ourselves to consider light propagating in the x-z-plane, which furthermore
is polarized either in the x-z-plane (p-polarized) or perpendicular to the x-z-plane (s-
polarized), the treatment can be split into eight separate parts related to the possible
combinations of polarization of the three different incident ﬁelds. In this scattering ge-
ometry ~qk (and ~kk) lie along the x-axis, giving a mirror plane at y = 0. Consequently,
only tensor elements in the (3 × 3 × 3 × 3) PCDFWM response tensor with a Cartesian
index even numbered in y contributes, and the 81 tensor elements generally appearing
are reduced to 41.

Applying the two polarization states s and p chosen above to the three interacting
ﬁelds, the resulting eight different combinations uses different matrix elements in the
nonlinear conductivity tensor, and (as would be expected) these eight combinations to-
gether make use of all elements of the nonlinear conductivity tensor. This division is
shown in Fig. 9.1 for the 41 contributing tensor elements as described in the following.
The noncontributing elements of the nonlinear conductivity tensor is denoted using the
symbol “·” in Fig. 9.1.

9.1 Eight sets of contributing matrix elements

From the point of view of the probe, the eight different combinations of polarized light
can be divided into two groups of four, namely four giving a PCDFWM response with the
same polarization as the probe and four giving the other polarization as the PCDFWM
response. In the four combinations giving response of the same polarization as the probe,
the two pump ﬁelds have the same polarization states. These conﬁgurations are sketched
in Fig. 9.2. The other four combinations, where the two pump ﬁelds are differently
polarized are sketched in Fig. 9.3.

Two out of the ﬁrst four combinations describe s to s transitions, seen from the point
of view of the probe. (i) The simplest combination arises when both pump ﬁelds and the
probe ﬁeld are s-polarized, as shown in Fig. 9.2.a. In this case, only the yyyy element
of the nonlinear conductivity tensor is present. In Fig. 9.1 it is marked with a “•”. It
should be noted that this is the only case of the eight, in which a single matrix element
can be determined independently in an actual experiment. (ii) When both pump ﬁelds

matrix elements in the nonlinear conductivity tensor have indices i and j equal to y and
indices k and h different from y. Each of these four elements is marked with a “(cid:3)” in
Fig. 9.1.

From the same point of view the other two of the ﬁrst four combinations describe p to
p transitions. (iii) If both pump ﬁelds are s-polarized and the probe ﬁeld is p-polarized
the conﬁguration is sketched in Fig. 9.2.c, and four matrix elements in the nonlinear

“(cid:4)”. (iv) The other extreme case [the simple extreme has been described in item (i)] is
the combination where both pump ﬁelds and the probe ﬁeld are p-polarized, as shown
in Fig. 9.2.d. In order to obtain the solution for this combination as many as sixteen
elements of the nonlinear conductivity tensor are required, since every element with an
index without y’s in it contributes. Each of these elements is marked in Fig. 9.1 with a
“◦”.

are differently polarized with respect to each other. In Figs. a–d the pump ﬁelds are denoted (1)
and (2) and the probe ﬁeld is denoted (p).

Still taking the “probe to response” point of view, two of the remaining four cases
represent a probe to response transition from s to p. (v) If pump ﬁeld 1 is s-polarized,
pump ﬁeld 2 is p-polarized, and the probe ﬁeld is s-polarized (the corresponding diagram
is showed in Fig. 9.3.a), the four contributing matrix elements have indices j and k equal
to y and indices i and h different from y. In Fig. 9.1 each of these elements is marked with
the symbol “♣”. In the other of these cases, (vi), pump ﬁeld 1 is p-polarized and pump
ﬁeld 2 is s-polarized, and we take the probe ﬁeld to be s-polarized. This combination is
sketched in Fig. 9.3.b, and the four contributing elements in the nonlinear conductivity
In
tensor then have indices j and k equal to y and indices i and h different from y.
Fig. 9.1 the symbol “♥” is used to show these elements. As a direct consequence of
the conservation of momentum criterion these two combinations are equivalent, since
by replacing ~qk with −~qk and~kk with −~kk the situation in (vi) changes to the situation in
(v).

The last two combinations represent a transition from p to s in the picture from probe
to response.
(vii) If pump ﬁeld 1 is s-polarized and pump ﬁeld 2 is p-polarized, but
the probe ﬁeld is p-polarized, the situation is as sketched in Fig. 9.3.c. Then again
four elements of the nonlinear conductivity tensor contribute to the solution. These four
elements have indices i and h equal to y and indices j and k different from y, and each
element is marked using the symbol “♦” in Fig. 9.1. Finally, (viii), when pump ﬁeld

60

Part III: DFWM in quantum well structures

1 is p-polarized and pump ﬁeld 2 is s-polarized, but the probe ﬁeld is p-polarized, the
conﬁguration appears as shown in Fig. 9.3.d, which again gives four elements of the
nonlinear conductivity tensor contributing to the solution, the indices i and k being equal
to y and the indices j and h being different from y. We mark each of these elements
with the symbol “♠” in Fig. 9.1. For the same reason as before, cases (vii) and (viii) are
equivalent.

9.2 Simpliﬁed description by choice of pump ﬁelds

Although the two pump ﬁelds has been drawn parallel to the interface in Figs. 9.2 and
9.3, this is not a requirement, as long as they are counterpropagating to each other. If
we are looking for a simpliﬁcation in the treatment of optical phase conjugation from a
quantum well structure, a reduction in the number of tensor elements to be calculated
could be one alternative. Two immediate possibilities comes to mind. In the ﬁrst case,
the pump ﬁelds are taken to be parallel to the x-axis. The second case has the pump
ﬁelds parallel to the z-axis. The consequences of these two cases are described in the
following.

If the pump ﬁelds propagate in a direction parallel to the x-axis, the number of con-
tributing tensor elements in the nonlinear conductivity tensor X (z, z′, z′′, z′′′;~qk,~kk) is re-
duced from 41 to 18 when considering s- and p-polarized light only. The surviving
elements can be divided into four cases following the four possible combinations of
polarization of the pump ﬁelds. When (i) both pump ﬁelds are p-polarized, their respec-
tive electric ﬁelds have only a z-component, and hence h = k = z. Similarly (ii), when
both pump ﬁelds are s-polarized, their electric ﬁelds only have a y-component, that is,
h = k = y. In case (iii) pump ﬁeld 1 is p-polarized while pump ﬁeld 2 is s-polarized,
giving h = z and k = y. In the ﬁnal case (iv) the pump ﬁelds are polarized oppositely to
those in case (iii), i.e., h = y and k = z.

If we choose the pump ﬁelds to propagate in a direction parallel to the z axis in-
stead, the number of contributing tensor elements in the nonlinear conductivity ten-
sor X (z, z′, z′′, z′′′;~qk,~kk) is again reduced from 41 to 18 when considering s- and p-
polarized light, and again the surviving elements are divided into four groups follow-
ing the four possible combinations of polarization the pump ﬁelds can have. Thus, (i)
when both pump ﬁelds are p-polarized, the electric ﬁelds representing them have only
x-components, i.e., h = k = x, (ii) for the pump ﬁelds both being s-polarized, the same
elements as when the pump ﬁelds are parallel to the x-axis contributes to the solution,
giving again h = k = y. In the cases of differently polarized pump ﬁelds, (iii) h = x and
k = y when pump ﬁeld 1 is p-polarized and pump ﬁeld 2 is s-polarized, and (iv) h = y
and k = x when the opposite polarizations occur.

In conclusion, these two possibilities of choice have ﬁve common contributing ele-
ments, namely the ones where k = h = y. At the same time, ten elements of the nonlinear
conductivity tensor does not contribute to either simpliﬁcation. They have kh ∈ {xz, zx}.

Optical phase conjugation
in a single-level metallic quantum well

62

Chapter 10

Theoretical considerations

Having discussed the properties of optical phase conjugation in quantum well structures
in general, let us consider here the simplest conﬁguration of a mesoscopic metallic op-
tical quantum-well phase conjugator. In this case only a single bound state exists below
the Fermi level and it is assumed that no levels above the Fermi level can be reached with
the applied optical ﬁeld. Such a quantum well is called a single-level quantum well.

10.1 Phase conjugated ﬁeld

In a mesoscopic ﬁlm the electric ﬁeld generated via the direct and indirect processes at
~J (3)
a given point is roughly speaking of the order (µ0w /q⊥)

has the magnitude (µ0w /q2)~J (3)

−w
judge the self-ﬁeld term to dominate the phase conjugated ﬁeld inside the quantum well,
at least for single-level metallic quantum wells which have thicknesses on the atomic
length scale.
In the following we therefore use the so-called self-ﬁeld (electrostatic)
approximation to calculate the phase conjugated ﬁeld inside the quantum well. With the
propagator G(z, z′′;~qk, w ) replaced by g(z − z′; w ), the phase conjugated ﬁeld fulﬁlls the
integral equation

In the self-ﬁeld approach the phase conjugated ﬁeld has only a component perpendic-
ular to the surface (the z-component) inside the well and only the z-component of the
nonlinear current density ~J (3)

−w drives the process.

Once the phase conjugated ﬁeld inside the quantum well has been determined in a
self-consistent manner from Eq. (10.1), it can be determined outside using Eq. (8.24).
The self-ﬁeld does of course not contribute to the exterior ﬁeld, and no loop problem is

involved. All that need to be done is to integrate known quantities in the z-direction over
the well.

10.2 Nonlinear conductivity tensor

As we may recall, the nonlinear conductivity tensor appearing in Eq. (8.8) may in gen-
eral be written as a sum of seven parts (A–G) after the physical processes they describe.
These have the tensor symmetries shown in Tab. 6.1. In this chapter we use this conduc-
tivity tensor in the form it takes for media with two-dimensional translational invariance
as it was developed in Part II, but for quantum wells so thin that only a single bound level
exists. The quantum well may be free standing, or it may be deposited on a substrate
that can be described by a refractive index n relative to the vacuum on the other side of
the ﬁlm. The surface of the ﬁlm is parallel to the x-y-plane in a Cartesian coordinate
system, and the interface between the ﬁlm and the substrate is placed at z = 0 as shown
in Fig. 8.1. We further limit our study to the case where (i) all scattering takes place in
the x-z-plane, (ii) the interacting ﬁelds are linearly polarized in (p) or perpendicular to
(s) the scattering plane, (iii) the pump ﬁelds in the phase conjugating system are coun-
terpropagating monochromatic plane waves with a uniform amplitude along the z-axis
and propagating in a direction parallel to the x-axis, and (iv) the ﬁeld is calculated within
the self-ﬁeld approximation.

From (i) above we get a mirror plane at y = 0, leaving only tensor elements of the
conductivity tensors with an even number (0, 2, 4) of y’s in the Cartesian index nonzero.
Condition (iii) implies as a consequence of condition (ii) that no tensor elements of the
nonlinear conductivity tensor with one or both of the last two Cartesian indices as x
contributes to the phase conjugated response. Requirement (iv) above implies that the
ﬁrst Cartesian index of a tensor element should be z in order to contribute to the phase
conjugated response. The choice of a single level quantum well in itself restricts the
transition current density to contain x- and y- components only. Together with the fact
that part B gives zero after integration over ~k
k and E gives pure interband contributions,
these choices leave two nonzero elements of the nonlinear conductivity tensor, namely

10.3 Probe with single Fourier component

In the following we calculate the phase conjugated ﬁeld generated by a probe ﬁeld which
consists of only one plane-wave component of wavevector ~q = (qk, 0, q⊥). A probe ﬁeld
of the form ~E(z;~qk) = ~Eeiq⊥z is hence inserted in Eq. (8.8).

Then, when using linearly polarized light, three different combinations of polarization
gives a nonlinear current density, namely (i) the one in which all participating ﬁelds are
p-polarized (ppp), and (ii) the two combinations where the pump ﬁelds are differently
polarized and the probe ﬁeld is s-polarized (sps and pss). In all cases, the phase conju-
gated response is p-polarized, and thus characterized in terms of the polarization states
of the probe and phase conjugated ﬁelds, case (i) may be classiﬁed as a p to p tran-
sition, and cases (ii) as s to p transitions. A schematic illustration of these interaction

(a and b–c) cases, the phase conjugated response is p-polarized. The schemes are shown in the
Cartesian coordinate system given in Fig. 8.1, such that the small arrows in the plane represents
p-polarized states and the circles represents s-polarized states. The large arrows show the direc-

In the above three equations, the superscript (1) refers to the pump ﬁeld propagating
along the x-axis in the positive direction (~kk = kk~ex), and the superscript (2) refers to
the other pump ﬁeld. The s to p transitions are symmetric in the sense that if the probe
wavevector ~qk is replaced by −~qk in Eq. (10.10), then the result of Eq. (10.11) is ob-
tained, and vice versa. The p to p transition is symmetric to itself in this sense.

In order to take into account the coupling to surroundings we have introduced a phe-
nomenological relaxation time t
zz [Eq. (10.12)]
(Feibelman 1982). A factor of two in this equation again stems from the spin summa-
tion, and the quantity N |y (z)|2 is the conduction electron density. The phase conjugated
ﬁeld inside the quantum well has a z-component, EPC,z(z;~qk), only, and by combining
Eqs. (10.1), (10.2), and (10.12) it appears that this is given by

which follows from the expression for the electromagnetic propagator, or equivalently
from the demand that the phase conjugated ﬁeld must be transverse in vacuum.

The integral in Eq. (10.15) is different from zero only in the region of the quantum well
[from around z′ = −d to around z′ = 0 in the chosen coordinate system, the exact domain
depending on the extent of the electronic wave function y (z′)]. Since the width (∼ d) of
a single-level metallic quantum well is in the ˚Angstr¨om range, and q⊥ is typically in the
micrometer range for optical signals such that q⊥d ≪ 1, it is a good approximation to put
exp(±iq⊥z′) = 1 in Eq. (10.15). For electromagnetic frequencies so high that q⊥ ∼ d−1,
the present theory would anyway be too simple to rely on [the Bloch function character
of the wave functions along the surface and excitation to the continuum (photoemission)
should be incorporated at least]. With the above-mentioned approximation, Eq. (10.15)
is reduced to

Thus the phase conjugated ﬁeld from a single-level quantum well is described in the
mixed Fourier space by Eq. (10.17) with insertion of Eq. (10.18), (10.19), or (10.20),
the expressions for C [Eq. (10.5)] and D [Eq. (10.6)] carrying the information on the
two-dimensional electron dynamics.

So far, the description of the phase conjugated response has been independent of the
actual wave functions in the active medium, and thus independent of the form of the
quantum well potential. In order to prepare our theory for a numerical study we now
introduce a model potential in our quantum well system, namely the inﬁnite barrier
potential.

10.4 Inﬁnite barrier model

To achieve a qualitative impression of the phase conjugation from a single-level metallic
quantum well it is sufﬁcient to carry out numerical calculations on the basis of the simple
inﬁnite barrier (IB) model. In this model the one-dimensional potential V (z) is taken to
be zero in the interval −d ≤ z ≤ 0 (inside the quantum well) and inﬁnite elsewhere. The
2/d sin(p z/d) inside the well
stationary state wave function now is given by y (z) =
and y (z) = 0 outside, and the associated energy is e = (p ~)2/(2med2). In the IB model
the number of bound states is of course inﬁnite, and to use this model in the context of a
single level calculation, one must be sure that only one of the bound states (the ground
state) has an energy below the Fermi energy, and that the optical frequency is so low that
interlevel excitations are negligible.

p

For a metallic quantum well one may even at room temperature approximate the
Fermi-Dirac distribution function appearing in the expressions for C , D , and N in
Eqs. (10.5), (10.6), and (10.13) by its value at zero temperature, i.e.,

69

~k
k appearing in Eqs. (10.5) and (10.6). This is adequately achieved by performing a co-
ordinate transformation into cylindrical coordinates, since each Heaviside step function
gives nonzero values in the k x-k y-space only inside a circle with radius, say, a
. The
explicit calculations are tedious but trivial to carry out, and since the ﬁnal expressions
for C and D are rather long we do not present them here. For the interested reader these
calculations are reproduced in Appendices B and C [speciﬁcally, Section C.11].

The Fermi energy is calculated from the global charge neutrality condition [see Keller
(1996a) and the calculation performed in Appendix D], which for a single level quantum
well takes the form

where N+ is the number of positive ions per unit volume and Z is the valence of these
ions. Since N = me(E F − e )/(p ~2), cf. the calculation in the Section C.11, one gets

N = ZN+d,

E F =

In order that just the ground state (energy e ) has an energy less than the Fermi energy, the
ﬁlm thickness must be less than a certain maximum value dmax. When the thickness of
the well becomes so large that the Fermi energy equals the energy e 2 = (2p ~)2/(2med2)
of the ﬁrst excited state a second bound state of energy less than E F will appear. From
the condition E F (dmax) = e 2(dmax), dmax can be calculated, and one gets by means of
Eq. (10.23)

dmax = 3

3p /(2ZN+) ,

i.e., a result which depends on the number of conduction electrons in the ﬁlm. The
minimum thickness is in the IB model zero, but in reality the smallest thickness is a

we get

Numerical results

The theoretical description presented in the previous chapter resulted in expressions for
the phase conjugated ﬁeld from a single level quantum well. Thus for the numerical
work, the phase conjugated ﬁeld is given completely by Eqs. (10.28)–(10.30) and (10.16)
with the insertion of the expressions for the electron dynamics parallel to the surface
plane, given by Eqs. (C.179)–(C.180) in Appendix C. In the following we will present
the phase conjugation reﬂection coefﬁcient, succeeded by a discussion of a possible
excitation scheme which might be adequate for studies of phase conjugation of optical
near ﬁelds (Bozhevolnyi, Keller, and Smolyaninov 1994).

11.1 Phase conjugation reﬂection coefﬁcient

To estimate the amount of light we get back through the phase conjugated channel, we
deﬁne the phase conjugation (energy) reﬂection coefﬁcient as

in which I(1), I(2), IProbe, and IPC are the intensities of the two pump beams, the probe
and the phase conjugated ﬁeld, respectively. Each of the intensities are given by

RPC(z;~qk) =

IPC(z;~qk)

,

I =

2

~E · ~E ∗
(2p )4 ,

(11.1)

(11.2)

where the factor of (2p )−4 originates from the manner in which we have introduced
the Fourier amplitudes of the ﬁelds.
If the probe ﬁeld is evanescent the intensity of
the phase conjugated ﬁeld, IPC(z;~qk), will depend on the distance from the surface, and
consequently the reﬂection coefﬁcient is z-dependent in such a case.

For the remaining part of this work we choose a copper quantum well with N+ =
8.47 × 1028m−3 and Z = 1 [data taken from Ashcroft and Mermin (1976)]. Then from
Eq. (10.24), the maximal thickness becomes dmax = 3.82 ˚A, which is more than two
monolayers and less than three. Thus we have two obvious choices for the thickness of
the quantum well, namely a single monolayer or two monolayers. We thus take a look

Figure 11.2: The phase conjugation reﬂection coefﬁcient at the vacuum/ﬁlm interface of a
two-monolayer copper quantum well, RPC(−d;~qk), is plotted for (ppp) the p to p transition
(corresponding to diagram (a) in Fig. 10.1), (sps) one of the s to p transitions (corresponding
to diagram (b) in Fig. 10.1), and (pss) the other s to p transition (corresponding to diagram
(c) in Fig. 10.1), as a function of the normalized component of the probe wavevector along the
interface, qk/q. The normalized Fermi wavenumber is indicated by the vertical line. For a two-
monolayer copper ﬁlm it is kF /q = 2.78 × 103. The set of arrows labeled n are placed at qk = nq.

wavevector for both the p to p transition and the two s to p transitions. The reason
that the two curves for the s to p transitions appear the same in the high end of the
qk/q spectrum is due to the fact that for kk ≪ qk we have C (qk − kk) ≃ C (qk + kk) and
D (qk, kk) ≃ D (qk, −kk). The “bubble” appearing on the sps and pss curves from around
qk/q ∼ 100 to qk/q ∼ kF /q is due to the two-dimensional electron dynamics hidden in
D (qk, kk). To be a little more speciﬁc, the left of the two peaks stems from the second
term, while the peak to the right in the bubble stems from the third term.

To illustrate the similarity between the two possible s to p transitions, we can take
Eq. (10.29) to describe the phase conjugated ﬁeld, which for positive values of qk/q
gives the result in Fig. 11.2 (sps). Using the other s to p transition, given by Eq. (10.30),
instead we get the result in Fig. 11.2 (pss) for positive values of qk/q. The symmetry
between the two conﬁgurations is obtained by looking at the negative values of qk/q,
since Eq. (10.29) plotted for negative values of qk/q gives the (pss) curve in Fig. 11.2.

would ﬁnd for bulk copper (Ashcroft and Mermin 1976) at (i) room temperature and
(ii) at 77K, and (iii) 3fs. The value in case (iii) is obtained by a conjecture based on
the difference between measured data for a lead quantum well (Jalochowski, Str˙o˙zak,
and Zdyb 1997) and the bulk value for lead at room temperature. The difference be-

76

Part IV: Optical phase conjugation in a single-level metallic quantum well

tween the relaxation time measured by Jalochowski, Str˙o˙zak, and Zdyb (1997) is for
two monolayers approximately one order of magnitude. Based on the results of Jalo-
chowski, Str˙o˙zak, and Zdyb (1997) we have for the data presented in this work chosen
the value of the relaxation time to be 3fs. As it can be seen from Fig. 11.4, the bubble in
the curve corresponding to the sps conﬁguration appears earlier in the qk/q-spectrum for
higher values of t . For the ppp conﬁguration the lower end of the spectrum is damped
when t becomes smaller.

So what is the difference between using a single monolayer or two monolayers in the
quantum well? In the single monolayer quantum well, the distance between the occupied
energy level and the ﬁrst free energy level in the inﬁnite barrier model, and between the
occupied energy level and the continuum states in a ﬁnite barrier model is larger than
for a two monolayer well. Thus the single-monolayer well should behave more ideally
like a single-level quantum well at higher frequencies than the two-monolayer well. If
we take a look at Figs. 11.1 and 11.2 we observe that the bubble in the sps and pss
curves has the highest maximal magnitude for the two-monolayer well, and the earliest
falloff in the high end of the qk/q-spectrum. The value of each of the two peaks in
the bubble is reached at the same qk/q-value in the two cases, as is also evident from
Figs. 11.3 and 11.4 (shown using a set of arrows for each peak). From these two ﬁgures
we also observe that the relaxation-time dependent low-qk/q beginning of the bubble
occurs a little earlier and is increasing faster in the two-monolayer well compared to
the other.
In the low end of the qk/q-spectrum the sps and pss curves are of equal
magnitude. Looking at the ppp curve, we observe that it is damped roughly by a factor
of two in the low end of the qk/q-spectrum using a single-monolayer ﬁlm in stead of
two monolayers. In the high end it takes its maximal value for the single-monolayer
well at rougly twice the value of qk/q than for the two-monolayer ﬁlm. In conclusion,
the differences between the phase conjugated response for a single-monolayer ﬁlm and
a two-monolayer ﬁlm will probably be very difﬁcult, if not impossible, to observe in
an experiment with single mode excitation. In the rest of this chapter we thus present
results for the two-monolayer ﬁlm only.

We have in Fig. 11.5 plotted the phase conjugation reﬂection coefﬁcient for the p to p
transition and one of the s to p transitions, respectively, for different distances from the
surface of the phase conjugator. Due to our particular interest in the phase conjugation
of the evanescent modes in the Fourier spectrum the chosen distances are fractions of the
vacuum wavelength. In Fig. 11.6 we have plotted the part of the Fourier spectrum for
all three conﬁgurations which is judged to be the most easily accessible to single-mode
excitation in experimental investigations.

It appears from Fig. 11.5 (ppp) that the phase conjugation reﬂection coefﬁcient is
independent of the distance from the metal ﬁlm in the region where qk/q ≤ 1. This is
so because the probe ﬁeld, and hence also the phase conjugated ﬁeld, are of propagating
k]1/2 is real). In the region where qk/q > 1, both the probe ﬁeld
character (q⊥ = [q2 − q2
and the phase conjugated ﬁeld are evanescent (q⊥ = i[q2
k − q2]1/2 is a purely imaginary
quantity), and in consequence the reﬂection coefﬁcient decreases rapidly with the dis-

tance from the phase conjugator. Already a single wavelength away from the surface
of the phase conjugator the evanescent modes of the phase conjugated ﬁeld have es-
sentially vanished and only propagating modes are detectable. Although the evanescent
Fourier components of the phase conjugated ﬁeld are present only less than an optical
wavelength from the surface, this does not imply that the nonlinear mixing of the elec-
tromagnetic waves is less effective in the regime of the evanescent modes. It is in fact
opposite, as may be seen for instance from Fig. 11.2. The maximum coupling for the p
to p transition is obtained for qk/q ≃ 500, and in comparison with RPC at qk/q ≃ 1, the
maximum in RPC is nine orders of magnitude larger, and seven, respectively eight orders
of magnitude larger for the two s to p transitions, which have their maxima at around
qk/q ≃ 700. As we observe from Fig. 11.5, as the distance from the ﬁlm increases the

78

Part IV: Optical phase conjugation in a single-level metallic quantum well

maximum value decreases and is shifted downwards in the qk/q spectrum. But only
when the distance from the phase conjugator becomes larger than ∼ l /10 (ppp) respec-
tively ∼ l /60 (sps), the phase conjugated signal is largest at qk/q ≈ 1.

The absolute value of the reﬂection coefﬁcients may seem very small, but utilizing a
high-power Nd:YAG laser with, say an energy of 100mJ per pulse available for each of
the three incoming ﬁelds, a pulse (assumed square for simplicity) duration of 4ns and
an interaction area of 25mm2, the intensity of each of these ﬁelds will be in the order of
1TW/m2, and the phase conjugated intensity lies between 100pW/m2 and 1W/m2 in the
full range of qk/q for which the reﬂection coefﬁcient has been plotted in Fig. 11.5 (ppp),
and between 1µW/m2 and 1kW/m2 in relation to the data in Fig. 11.5 (sps).

In many theoretical studies of the properties of phase conjugated ﬁelds it is assumed
that the phase conjugator is ideal (Hendriks and Nienhuis 1989; Agarwal and Gupta
1995; Keller 1996c). By this is meant that the phase conjugation reﬂection coefﬁcient
is independent of the angle of incidense of the (propagating) probe ﬁeld (and maybe
also of the state of polarization). In the present case, the ideal phase conjugator assump-
tion is certainly not good. Prior to the observation that evanescent ﬁelds could be phase
conjugated (Bozhevolnyi, Keller, and Smolyaninov 1994) it was often assumed in theory
(Yariv 1982) that RPC = 0 in the region qk/q > 1, and in later studies (Agarwal and Gupta
1995; Keller 1996c) it has been assumed that also the phase conjugation of evanescent
waves is ideal, i.e., independent of qk/q (& 1). When it comes to the phase conjuga-
tion from quantum well systems our analysis indicates that use of an energy reﬂection
coefﬁcient independent of qk/q in general is bad. Only at speciﬁc distances the ideal
phase conjugator assumption might be justiﬁed, see, e.g., the results representing RPC
at |z + d| = l /8 in Fig. 11.6. The kink in the reﬂection coefﬁcient (which is most pro-
nounced close to the metal/vacuum interface) found at qk/q = n (= 1.51) appears when
the probe ﬁeld changes from being propagating to being evanescent inside the substrate.

Above we have discussed the nonlinear reﬂection coefﬁcient for the p to p conﬁgura-
tion. It appears from Figs. 11.5 and 11.6 that the quantitative picture is the same for the s
to p cases, though the reﬂection coefﬁcient for the s to p transitions roughly speaking are
ﬁve orders of magnitude larger in the experimentally most adequate evanescent region
of the Fourier spectrum (1 ≤ qk/q . 2.5) for single mode excitation.

The IB model only offers a crude description of the electronic properties of a quantum
well. Among other things, the electron density proﬁle at the ion/vacuum edge is poorly
accounted for in this model, which gives too sharp a proﬁle and underestimates the spill-
out of the wave function. Altogether one should be careful to put too much reality into
the IB model when treating local-ﬁeld variations (related to, say, qk or q⊥) on the atomic
length scale. Also the neclect of the Bloch character of the wave functions accounting
for the dynamics in the plane of the well is doubtful in investigations of the local ﬁeld
among the atoms of the quantum well. The crucial quantity in the above-mentioned
context is the Fermi wavenumber kF = (2meE F )1/2/~, and in relation to Fig. 11.5, only

Insertion of the appropriate values for copper: ZN+ = 8.47 × 1028,
appears reliable.
d = 1.8 ˚A (single monolayer ﬁlm) or d = 3.6 ˚A (two-monolayer ﬁlm), and the wavelength
l = 1061nm gives kF = 3.38 × 103q for a single monolayer of copper, and kF = 2.76 ×
103q for two monolayers of copper, respectively. The data presented in Fig. 11.5 should
therefore be well within this limit of our model.

Returning to the curve in Fig. 11.5 (ppp) which represents the reﬂection coefﬁcient
closest to the surface of the phase conjugator (|z + d| = l /256) one ﬁnds approximately
a relation of the form RPC = b(qk/q)a with a ≃ 5 in the lower wavenumber end of the
evanescent region. The falloff of RPC with qk/q after the maximum (located at qk/q ∼
50) is much stronger than the increase towards the maximum. As the distance from the
phase conjugator is increased the value of a gradually decreases. In Fig. 11.5 (b) we
observe a similar behaviour, but this time the value of a in the approximate relation in
the low end of the evanescent part of the Fourier spectrum is smaller, namely a ≃ 1.5.

The energy reﬂection coefﬁcient calculated at the vacuum/quantum well interface,
RPC(−d;~qk), characterizes the effectiveness with which a given (qk) plane-wave probe
ﬁeld (propagating or evanescent) may be phase conjugated, and the results presented
in Fig. 11.2 indicate that this effectiveness (nonlinear coupling) is particularly large for
(part of the) evanescent modes. The maximum in the effectivity is reached for a value
of qk/q as large as ∼ 500–700. The strong coupling in part of the evanescent region
does not necessarily reﬂect itself in any easy manner experimentally. First of all, one
must realize that the strong coupling effect only may be observed close to the quantum
well, i.e., at distances z . l
. Secondly, one must be able to produce evanescent probe
ﬁelds with relatively large values of qk/q. This is in itself by no means simple outside
the range when the standard Otto (1968, 1976) [or possibly Kretschmann (Kretschmann
and Raether 1968; Raether 1988)] techniques can be adopted. Roughly speaking, this
range coincides with the ones shown in Fig. 11.6. To create probe ﬁelds with larger
qk/q values other kinds of experimental techniques must be used, and in the following
we shall consider a particular example and in a qualitative manner discuss the resulting
Fourier spectrum of the phase conjugated ﬁeld.

11.2 Phase conjugated response using a wire source

In near-ﬁeld optics evanescent ﬁelds with relatively large values of qk/q are produced
by various methods, all aiming at compressing the source ﬁeld to subwavelength spatial
extension [see, e.g., Pohl and Courjon (1993) and Nieto-Vesperinas and Garc´ıa (1996)].
From a theoretical point of view the radiation from a subwavelength source may in some
cases be modelled by the radiation from an (electric) point-dipole source, or an assembly
of such sources. It is a straightforward matter to decompose an electric point-dipole ﬁeld

Chapter 11: Numerical results

81

into its relevant evanescent and propagating modes, and thereby estimate the intensity of
the phase conjugated ﬁeld in each of the qk-components. However, in order to determine
the characteristics of the phase conjugated light focus generated by the quantum well one
would have to calculate the four-wave mixing also for probe ﬁelds with wavevectors not
conﬁned to the x-z-plane, and to do this our theory must ﬁrst be generalized to non-planar
phase conjugation.

Within the framework of the present theory, it is possible, however, to study the spatial
conﬁnement (focusing) of the phase conjugated ﬁeld generated by a quantum wire ade-
quately placed above the surface of the quantum well (Keller 1998), and let us therefore
as an example consider the case where the source of the probe ﬁeld is a (quantum) wire.
We imagine that the axis of the wire is placed parallel to the y-axis and cuts the x-z-plane
in the point (0, −z0), cf. Fig. 8.1. Under the assumption that the spatial electron conﬁne-
ment in the wire is perfect (complete) and the wire current density is the same all along
the wire at a given time, the harmonic source current density is given by

~J(~r; w ) = ~J0(w )d (x)d (z + z0),

where ~J0(w ) is its possibly frequency dependent vectorial amplitude. The spatial distri-
bution of the ﬁeld from this source is

To illustrate the angular spectral distribution of the ﬁeld from this kind of wire source
at the phase conjugator, we look closer at the cases, where (i) the current density is po-

is also presented in Fig. 11.7, for the same distances as in case (i). The third curve in
Fig. 11.7 represents the case where ~J0(w ) = J0(w )~ez, and is shown for reference.

Looking at the curve in Fig. 11.7 corresponding to ~J0(w ) = J0(w )~ey (and the curve
corresponding to ~J0(w ) = J0(w )~ez), we notice that a singularity occurs when qk/q = 1,
or equivalently where q⊥ = 0. The presence of this singularity is an artifact originat-
ing in the (model) assumption that the electron conﬁnement is complete in the x- and

z-directions (see Eq. (11.5)). If we had started from a quantum wire current density of
ﬁnite (but small) extension in x and z the singularity would have been replaced by a (nar-
row) peak of ﬁnite height. Not only in quantum wire optics, but also in optical studies
of quantum dots and wells singularities would appear if complete electron conﬁnement
was assumed (in 3D and 1D, respectively).
In the present context the assumption of
perfect electron conﬁnement works well because we only consider the generated ﬁeld
outside the self-ﬁeld region of the wire [see, e.g., Keller (1997b)]. In an experiment one
would always end up integrating over some ﬁnite interval of qk around the singularity,
and this integral can in all cases be proven ﬁnite. At each distance of the wire from
the phase conjugator the two curves J0~ex and J0~ez in Fig. 11.7 becomes identical when
(qk/q)2 ≫ 1, since from Eq. (11.7) we may draw the relation Ez = −(qk/q⊥)Ex, and
since qk/q⊥ ≃ 1 when (qk/q)2 ≫ 1.

When the current oscillates in the direction of the wire, it appears that the ﬁeld inten-
sity in the evanescent probe modes is very small. An appreciable amount of the radiated
energy is stored in components in the region qk/q ∼ 1 (and in the propagating modes).
To study the phase conjugation of evanescent modes it is therefore better to start from
~J0(w ) = J0(w )~ex or from ~J0(w ) = J0(w )~ez because these two probe current densities give
rise to signiﬁcant probe intensities in the evanescent regime. If we look at the curve in
Fig. 11.7 representing the ﬁeld at the surface of the phase conjugator when the probe is
placed at z0 − d = l /256, IProbe peaks in both these cases at qk/q ∼ 50 in the evanescent
regime. When the current density oscillates along the surface (in the x-direction) there is
no singularity (and no peak) at qk/q ∼ 1, and the maximum value of IProbe, occuring at
qk/q ∼ 50, is three orders of magnitude larger than the probe intensities of every one of
the propagating modes. Above qk/q ≈ 50 the amplitude of the qk components descends
rapidly and has lost six orders of magnitude within the next order of magnitude of qk/q.
At larger probe to surface distances the maximum in the qk/q spectrum of the probe ﬁeld
at the vacuum/ﬁlm interface is shifted downwards, and the magnitude becomes smaller,
too. That is, compared to the raw p to p reﬂection coefﬁcient, the intensity of each of the
Fourier components available from the probe ﬁeld begin their own falloff about one to
two orders of magnitude before the reﬂection coefﬁcient descends, depending on the dis-
tance from the probe to the surface of the phase conjugator. The s-polarized probe ﬁeld
starts the descending tendency already where the character of the Fourier components
shifts from being propagating to evanescent (q⊥ becoming imaginary), cf. the remarks
above.

Using a quantum wire as the source for the probe ﬁeld, the angular spectrum of the
phase conjugated response, normalized to the pump ﬁelds and the absolute square of the
amplitude of the wire current density, is given by

monolayer ﬁlm, but since the main contribution is in the low end of the qk/q-spectrum,
the similar curves for the single-monolayer ﬁlm would be indistinguishable from the
ones plotted (apart from a factor of two in the ppp case). In both cases data are presented
for the wire placed at different distances from the vacuum/ﬁlm interface. By comparison
with the raw reﬂection data in Fig. 11.2 it appears that the high end of the reﬂected qk-
spectrum is strongly damped. For the s to p transition we see that the energy of the phase
conjugated signal is concentrated around qk/q = 1, which is mainly due to the fact that
the concentration of the radiated energy spectrum from the wire lies around that same
point. In the p to p transition the evanescent components are still by far dominating the
response at the place of the wire compared to the propagating components.

Two-dimensional conﬁnement of light
in front of a single-level quantum-well phase conjugator

The possibility of compressing light in space to a degree (much) better than predictable
by classical diffraction theory has gained widespread attention only with the birth of
near-ﬁeld optics (Pohl and Courjon 1993; Nieto-Vesperinas and Garc´ıa 1996).

As stated in Chapter 1, sub-wavelength electrodynamics was discussed only sporadi-
cally until near-ﬁeld optics evolved in the mid-eighties in the wake of the experimental
works by the groups of Pohl, Lewis, and Fischer (Pohl, Denk, and Lanz 1984; Lewis,
Isaacson, Harootunian, and Murray 1984; Fischer 1985). The ﬁrst investigations are
usually attributed to Synge, who presented a proposal for sub-wavelength microscopy
as early as in 1928. The subject was studied again in 1944 by Bethe, by Bouwkamp
in 1950, and a proposal much similar to that of Synge was made by O’Keefe in 1956.
Using microwaves, Ash and Nichols resolved a grating with a linewidth of l /60 in 1972.
In the wake of theoretical studies of the possibility for phase conjugating the ﬁeld
emitted from a mesoscopic object carried out by Keller (1992), creation of light foci
with a diameter below the classical diffraction limit was demonstrated experimentally
by Bozhevolnyi, Keller, and Smolyaninov (1994, 1995), who used the ﬁbre tip of a near
ﬁeld optical microscope to create source spots of red light (633nm) in front of a photore-
fractive Fe:LiNbO3 crystal, which acted as a phase conjugator. After creation, the phase
conjugated replica of these light spots could be detected using the near ﬁeld microscope,
since they were maintained for approximately ten minutes because of the long memory
of the phase conjugation process in the crystal. The resulting phase conjugated light foci
had diameters of around 180nm, and the conclusion of their work was therefore that at
least some of the evanescent ﬁeld components of the source also must have been phase
conjugated in order to achieve the observed size of the phase conjugated image.

The above-mentioned observation drew renewed attention to the description of focus-
ing of electromagnetic ﬁelds in front of phase conjugating mirrors, and required inclu-
sion of evanescent modes in the description of the optical phase conjugation process. In
an important paper, Agarwal and Gupta (1995), extending an original idea of Agarwal
(1982), undertook an analysis of the phase conjugated replica of the ﬁeld from a point
particle as it is produced by a so-called ideal phase conjugator, and in recent articles by
Keller (1996b, 1996c) attention was devoted to an investigation of microscopic aspects
of the spatial conﬁnement problem of the phase conjugated ﬁeld.

In the previous chapters, we developed a microscopic theory for optical phase con-

jugation by degenerate four-wave mixing in mesoscopic interaction volumes, with the
aim of establishing a theoretical framework for inclusion of near ﬁeld components in
the analysis. In order for near ﬁeld components to give a signiﬁcant contribution to the
phase conjugated response, the phase conjugation process must be effective in a surface
layer of thickness (much) less than the optical wavelength. This makes quantum well
systems particularly adequate candidates for the nonlinear mixing process.

In this chapter we employ the developed microscopic theory to a study of the spa-
tial conﬁnement of an electromagnetic ﬁeld emitted from an ideal line source (quantum
wire with complete electron conﬁnement), paying particular attention to the evanescent
part of the angular spectrum. As phase conjugator a single-level metallic quantum well,
particularly effective in phase conjugating evanescent ﬁeld components, albeit with an
overall small conversion efﬁciency, is used. The relevant expression for the phase con-
jugated ﬁeld is given and the result of a numerical calculation of the nonlinear energy
reﬂection coefﬁcient for a copper well presented. Finally, the intensity distribution of the
phase conjugated ﬁeld in the region between the line source and the phase conjugator is
calculated and the two-dimensional spatial focusing investigated.

12.1 Quantum wire as a two-dimensional point source

As starting point, we consider a line source (quantum wire) placed parallel to the y-axis
of a Cartesian coordinate system and cutting the x-z-plane in the point (0, −z0). In the
description of the source we assume (i) perfect spatial electron conﬁnement in the wire
and (ii) constant current density along the wire at a given time. Choosing the wire current
to oscillate along the x-direction, the above-mentioned assumptions lead to a harmonic
source current density given by

~J(~r; w ) = J0(w )d (x)d (z + z0)~ex,

where ~J0(w ) = J0(w )~ex is its possibly frequency dependent vectorial amplitude, ~ex being
a unit vector in the x-direction. In order to calculate the phase conjugated response using
the developed microscopic model we perform a Fourier analysis of the source ﬁeld along
the x-axis. The electric ﬁeld of the quantum wire at the surface (z = −d) of the phase
conjugating mirror thus becomes

Figure 12.1: The angular spectral distribution of the ﬁeld generated by a quantum wire at the
surface of the phase conjugator is shown for the seven different distances z0 − d ∈ {l /4, l /8,
l /16, l /32, l /64, l /128, l /256} of the wire from the phase conjugating ﬁlm. Inserted is shown
the scattering geometry. The ﬁlm/substrate and vacuum/ﬁlm interfaces are at z = 0 and z = −d,
respectively, and the wire crosses the x-z-plane in the point (x, z) = (0, −z0). As indicated by the
double arrow the current oscillations of the wire is along the x-direction. The arrows between the
vacuum/ﬁlm and ﬁlm/substrate interfaces indicate the two pump wavevectors. The arrows drawn
from the source towards the vacuum/ﬁlm interface indicate the angular spreading of the source
ﬁeld.

In Eq. (12.3), q⊥ is determined from the vacuum dispersion relation for the ﬁeld, i.e.,

(q2
satisfying the inequality |qk| < q, q⊥ = (q2 − q2
k)1/2 is real (and positive), whereas for
evanescent modes having |qk| > q, q⊥ = i(q2

trate the angular spectral distribution of the ﬁeld from the wire at the phase conjuga-
tor, we calculate the magnitude of the differential source (probe) ﬁeld intensity, i.e.,

12.2 Single-level metallic quantum-well phase conjugator

We take as the active medium a metallic quantum well, and we describe the conduction
electron dynamics using the inﬁnite barrier model potential. While such a model poten-
tial from a quantitative point of view of course is too na¨ıve, in particular in cases where
the conduction electrons of the well are allowed to mix with those of a semiconducting
or metallic substrate, it sufﬁces in the present context. We further assume that only the
lowest lying band is below the Fermi energy and that the photon energy is so small that
interband transitions do not contribute to the electrodynamics. The quantum well is de-
posited on a substrate that can be described alone by its refractive index n. Because of the
chosen polarization of the wire current density we have limited the description to cover
only the case where all interacting electric ﬁelds are polarized in the scattering plane
(p-polarization). Then, within the limits of a self-ﬁeld approximation, the z-component
of the phase conjugated ﬁeld becomes [Eq. (10.28)]

12.3 Numerical results and discussion

For the numerical calculation we consider a copper quantum well [d = 1.8 ˚A (for single-
monolayer ﬁlm), respectively 3.6 ˚A (two monolayers), N+ = 8.47 × 1028m−3 and Z = 1
(Ashcroft and Mermin 1976)] deposited on a glass substrate with n = 1.51, giving kk =
1.51q when the wavevectors of the pump ﬁelds are parallel to the x-axis. The wavelength
of the light is chosen to be l = 1061nm. For a glass substrate it is adequate to calculate
the linear vaccum/substrate amplitude reﬂection coefﬁcient rp by means of the classical
1
Fresnel formula rp = [n2q⊥ − (n2q2 − q2
2 ]. In the view of the
k)
recent experimental data discussed in Section 11.1 (Jalochowski, Str˙o˙zak, and Zdyb
1997), we have chosen an intraband relaxation time of t = 3fs for the electrons in the
ultrathin quantum-well ﬁlm.

To give an impression of the efﬁciency of the phase conjugation process for the various
evanescent modes, the nonlinear energy reﬂection coefﬁcient of the phase conjugator at
the vacuum/ﬁlm interface, RPC(qk), is shown in Fig. 12.2 as a function of the parallel
component (qk) of the probe wavevector for the two possible single-level quantum wells.
It appears from this ﬁgure that in particular high spatial frequency components (102 .
qk/q . 103) are phase conjugated in an effective manner. This is associated with the fact
that in a single-level quantum well the two-dimensional intraband electron dynamics
along the plane of the well is responsible for the main part of the phase conjugation
process.

Using a square-potential barrier model to describe the quantum well the integra-
tion limits should not extend beyond the (two-dimensional) Fermi wavenumber kF =
[2p ZN+d + (p /d)2]1/2 for the single level quantum well. Looking at the phase conju-
gation reﬂection coefﬁcient shown in Fig. 12.2, we not only notice that the main con-
tribution to the phase conjugated signal is well above the point where the probe ﬁeld
becomes evanescent in vaccum, but also does not extend beyond the Fermi wavenum-
ber. The phase conjugated image of our quantum-wire source ﬁeld is then given by

in the x-z-plane.

(12.7)

It appears from Eq. (12.5), that the individual angular components of the phase con-
jugated ﬁeld decay exponentially with the distance from the phase conjugator in the
evanescent part of the Fourier spectrum. The evanescent components of the source like-
wise decay exponentially with the distance from the quantum wire. Therefore, the con-
tribution from the evanescent components to the total phase conjugated ﬁeld is expected
to increase signiﬁcantly when the distance between the source and the phase conjugator
becomes smaller. Experimentally, it is feasible presently to carry out measurements at
distances from the surface down to ∼ 40 ˚A (using near-ﬁeld microscopes). For the cho-
sen system this leads to an intensity distribution in the x-z-plane between the probe and
the phase conjugator as shown in Figs. 12.3 and 12.4 for different distances between the
probe and the ﬁlm, z0 − d ∈ {l /4, 3l /16, l /8, 3l /32, l /16}, Fig. 12.3 corresponding

to the single-monolayer ﬁlm and Fig. 12.4 to the two-monolayer ﬁlm. For z0 − d & l /2,
the effect of the near-ﬁeld components are negligible. In both Figs. 12.3 and 12.4, the
ﬁgures to the left show by equal-intensity contours the intensity distribution of the phase
conjugated ﬁeld in the area of the x-z-plane between the quantum wire and the surface
of the phase conjugator. The width (along the x-axis) of the shown area is in all cases
twice the height (along the z-axis) on both sides of x = 0. The contours are drawn in an
exponential sequence, so that if the ﬁrst contour corresponds to the intensity I(1)
PC the n-th
contour is associated with the intensity I(n)
PC = I(1)
], a varying from ﬁgure to
ﬁgure. To further illustrate the capabilities of light focusing the chosen system possess,
we have to the right on a linear scale shown the phase conjugated intensity at (i) the
surface of the phase conjugator (solid lines) and (ii) along an axis parallel to the x-axis
placed at the same distance from the phase conjugator as the wire (dashed lines). The
two curves in each of the plots to the right are adjusted by multiplication of the curve in
case (ii) by a factor of (a) 2590, (b) 545, (c) 271, (d) 353, and (e) 586 in Fig. 12.3, and
by a factor of (a) 555, (b) 212, (c) 204, (d) 322, and (e) 528 in Fig. 12.4, respectively, so
that the maximum values coincide in the plots.

PC exp[(1 − n)a

It is seen from Figs. 12.3 and 12.4 that the width of the focus created by the phase
conjugated ﬁeld in all cases is smallest at the surface of the phase conjugator. Further-
more one observe that the focus becomes narrower when the distance between the source
and the ﬁlm becomes smaller, as one should expect when evanescent ﬁeld components
give a signiﬁcant contribution to the process. At the surface the width of the main peak
decreases roughly by a factor of two every time the source-ﬁlm distance decreases by
the same factor. This tendency continues closer to the surface of the phase conjugator, at
least down to around l /256 ≈ 4nm, where the structure of the intensity distribution looks
more or less like Fig. 12.3.e [and Fig. 12.4.e], scaled appropriately with the distance.

The difference between the ability of the single-monolayer ﬁlm and the two-mono-
layer ﬁlm to focus the ﬁeld emitted from the source is small, as we would expect from
the analysis in the previous chapter. We observe from Fig. 12.3 that when the source is
far away from the ﬁlm (a–b), the intensity of the phase conjugated ﬁeld decays faster
in the case of a single-monolayer ﬁlm than in the other case. Furthermore, we observe
that the width of the centre peak is somewhat smaller for the focus in front of the single-
monolayer phase conjugator, and that the height of the ﬁrst sidelobe is slightly higher
compared to the centre peak. Taking the source closer to the surface (c–e) we observe
that the distance between minima in Fig. 12.3 is still smaller than in Fig. 12.4, but that
the width of the centre peak becomes more and more equal in the two cases.

To give an impression of the size of the phase conjugated focus, let us take a look
at Fig. 12.4.e, where the distance from the probe to the surface is l /16 ≈ 66nm. The
distance between the two minima at the surface of the phase conjugator is in this case
around 40nm (approximately l /25). In the plane of the probe the distance between the
two minima is around 100nm (∼ l /10).

Discussion

We have in the previous three chapters discussed the phase conjugation response of a
single-level quantum well, where only intraband transitions are possible. It is evident
from our analysis that in this case the phase conjugated response depends strongly on
the component of the probe wavevector that is parallel to the surface of the phase con-
jugator (qk). Consequently, the assumption of an ideal phase conjugator with constant
reﬂection coefﬁcient throughout the full qk-spectrum must be abandoned, at least when
a single-level quantum-well phase conjugator is considered. The nonlinear coupling is
strongest in the evanescent part of the qk-spectrum above the point up to which the probe
ﬁeld is propagating in the substrate (qk/q = n). As a consequence, if one wants to ob-
serve the phase conjugation of a broad Fourier spectrum of evanescent modes, both the
observation and the excitation are required to take place near the surface of the phase
conjugator.

As a possible method to excite the Fourier components in the high end of the qk-
spectrum we have analyzed the consequences of using a quantum wire. When the quan-
tum wire is placed close to the phase conjugator the phase conjugated response contains
a broad range of evanescent components. This property made it a good candidate for
investigations of the problem of focusing light to a spatial extent less than the Rayleigh
limit. The spatial focusing of the phase conjugated response from a quantum wire was
studied, and the problem of the resolution limit has been addressed. The conclusion of
this study is in agreement with previous studies and mainly shows that the focus gets
narrower when the distance from the quantum wire to the phase conjugator gets shorter.
Judging from this we may conclude that in order to establish a better estimate of the
limit of resolution the present model has to be improved, since continuing to get closer
becomes meaningless at some point.

In examining the phase conjugation response of the single-level quantum well we
have chosen a speciﬁc frequency of the interacting electromagnetic ﬁelds, which should
be feasible for an experiment. It would be interesting to give a more detailed account
of how (i) the phase conjugated response and (ii) the focusing of the phase conjugated
ﬁeld varies with the frequency. These properties will not be discussed in detail in this
dissertation, but let us at this point just mention that (i) it seems like the evanescent
components in the high end of the Fourier spectrum becomes better phase conjugated
when the interacting ﬁelds move to longer wavelengths, and (ii) the spatial distance

Theoretical properties

From the simple description of a quantum well where only intraband transitions con-
tributed to the phase conjugated response we now turn our attention to the case where
transitions between energy levels in the quantum well (interband transitions) can take
place. In this chapter we therefore give the theoretical description that is necessary to
describe the phase conjugated response from a quantum well where both interband and
intraband transitions contribute to the response. In the following we adopt the same scat-
tering geometry as in the previous treatment, i.e., scattering takes place in the x-z-plane
and we use light that is polarized either in (p-polarized) or perpendicular to (s-polarized)
the scattering plane.

14.1 Phase conjugated ﬁeld

Unlike in the case of a single-level quantum well, we cannot rely on the self-ﬁeld ap-
proximation when considering multi-level quantum wells (with resonances). We there-
fore begin this treatment with the loop equation for the phase conjugated ﬁeld in the
two-dimensional Fourier space [Eq. (8.24)]. It is repeated here for convenience:

~EPC(z;~qk, w ) = ~E B

PC(z;~qk, w )

−iµ0w

G(z, z′′;~qk, w ) · s (z′′, z′;~qk, w ) · ~EPC(z′;~qk, w )dz′′dz′.

Z Z

The background ﬁeld in Eq. (14.1) is given by

PC(z;~qk, w ) = −iµ0w
~E B

G(z, z′;~qk, w ) · ~J (3)

−w (z′;~qk, w )dz′,

Z

and can be determined from the previous analysis. The linear conductivity tensor con-
sists in general of a diamagnetic and a paramagnetic part (see the discussion in Chap-
ters 5 and 6). It is, however, possible to combine the two parts in such a way that the
diamagnetic conductivity tensor can be written as a correction to the paramagnetic one
(Keller 1996a, 1997a, 1997b). Then the expression for the total linear conductivity ten-
sor becomes

Numerical results for a two-level quantum well

Besides calculation of the nonlinear current densities, the main numerical work consists
of ﬁnding the solution to the appropriate sets of equations, given by Eq. (14.31) for
processes with s-polarized response, and Eqs. (14.32) and (14.33) for processes with
p-polarized response. Computational procedures to solve this kind of problems are well
known (see, e.g., Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling, and Flannery 1992, 1996a, 1996b for
description and Fortran routines).

15.1 Phase conjugation reﬂection coefﬁcient

To estimate the amount of light we get back through the phase conjugated channel, we
use the phase conjugation reﬂection coefﬁcient RPC(z;~qk) deﬁned in Eq. (11.1) together
with the expression for the intensities given by Eq. (11.2). As before, the reﬂection
coefﬁcient at the surface of the quantum well is thus RPC(−d;~qk).

In order to give an impression of the difference between the calculation where only
intraband contributions were taken into account (chapter 11) the present calculation is
also based on the data for a two-monolayer thick copper quantum well [N+ = 8.47 ×
1028m−3, Z = 1, and d = 3.8 ˚A (Ashcroft and Mermin 1976)]. As was the case for
the single-level Cu quantum well, the two-level Cu quantum well can adequately be
deposited on a glass substrate for which we use a refractive index n of 1.51. With this
substrate, a reasonable description of the linear vaccum/substrate amplitude reﬂection
coefﬁcients (rp for the p-polarized light and rs for the s-polarized light) can be obtained
by use of the classical Fresnel formulae, given by Eq. (11.3) and

Keeping the pump ﬁelds parallel to the x-axis, we get a pump wavenumber kk = 1.51q.
In Figs. 15.1 and 15.2 we have plotted the phase conjugation reﬂection coefﬁcient at
the interface between the vacuum and the quantum well as a function of the parallel com-
ponent of the wavevector normalized to the vacuum wavenumber, qk/q. The wavelength
has in these plots been ﬁxed to l = 1061nm (the same as in the single-level case). The

plots have been divided into two sets, together covering all eight different combinations
of polarization of the interacting ﬁelds. In Fig. 15.1 is plotted the four combinations
leading to a response with the same state of polarization as the probe, i.e., (i) the purely
p-polarized case where all interacting ﬁelds are polarized in the scattering plane (denoted
ppp), (ii) the purely s-polarized (sss) case where all three interacting ﬁelds are polarized
perpendicular to the scattering plane, (iii) the case where the two pump ﬁelds both are p-
polarized and the probe ﬁeld is s-polarized (pps), and (iv) the case where the probe ﬁeld
is p-polarized and the two pump ﬁelds are s-polarized (ssp). The results for the other
four combinations of polarization has been plotted in pairs in Fig. 15.2. The upper ﬁgure
in Fig. 15.2 shows the two cases where the pump ﬁelds are differently polarized and the
probe ﬁeld is s-polarized, while in the lower ﬁgure, the probe ﬁeld is p-polarized, still
with differently polarized pump ﬁelds. The vertical line inserted into Figs. 15.1 and 15.2

two-level quantum well, w /w 12, for the four combinations of polarization of the three interact-
ing ﬁelds which have equal pump ﬁeld polarization (ppp, sss, ssp, and pps). The transition
frequency w 12 in the present case is w 12 = 1.32 × 1016rad/s, corresponding to a wavelength of

well is 2.78 × 103. The discussion of this quantity has been given in chapter 11 (in the
paragraph starting at the end of page 78).

In addition to the plots in Figs. 15.1 and 15.2, where the phase conjugation reﬂection
coefﬁcient was plotted as a function of qk/q, we have in Figs. 15.3 and 15.4 plotted the
phase conjugation reﬂection coefﬁcient as a function of the optical frequency normalized
to the interband transition frequency, w /w 12. The parallel component of the wavevector
has in this case been ﬁxed at qk = 0.8q (in the propagating regime). Again, the four
cases of pump ﬁelds having the same polarization are plotted in the ﬁrst of the two
ﬁgures (Fig. 15.3), and the remaining four in the other ﬁgure (Fig. 15.4).

All plots in Figs. 15.1–15.4 have been plotted using a relaxation time of 200fs in the
interband transition from the occupied state to the unoccupied state and a relaxation time
of 3fs within the intraband transitions of the occupied state. Unlike in the case of pure
intraband response, the choice of adequate relaxation times seem less important in the
two-level quantum-well case. Changing either of the relaxation times (or both) an order

of magnitude up or down doesn’t change the results shown in Figs. 15.1–15.4 so much
that the two curves for the respective choices of relaxation times would differ from each
other, as it was the case in the single-level quantum well (see Fig. 11.4).

Returning our attention to Fig. 15.1, we observe that the purely p-polarized combi-
nation of polarization gives the strongest phase conjugated response while the purely
s-polarized combination gives the weakest response of the four. Looking at the ppp
curve, we see that the maximum value is reached in the propagating regime of the
qk/q-spectrum, where two peaks occur approximately at the values of qk = 0.18q and
qk = 0.22q. These peaks must be due to the pump waves being p-polarized, since they
also occur in the pps conﬁguration, but in neither of the sss and ssp conﬁgurations. In
the evanescent regime the ppp curve is increasing from the point qk = nq until it reaches
its maximal value at around qk = 103q. Above qk = 103q, the ppp response starts de-
caying again. The pps curve in Fig. 15.1 has, apart from the two peaks discussed above,
two additional peaks occuring symmetrically around the point nq in the qk-spectrum, at
approximately qk = 1.1q and qk = 1.9q, respectively. After the second of these peaks,
the amplitude of the response fades away with growing values of qk. The ssp curve has
a maximum when the probe ﬁeld is perpendicularly incident on the phase conjugator
(qk/q = 0), and another one where the probe ﬁeld becomes evanescent in the substrate,
i.e., at qk = nq. In the evanescent regime of the qk/q-spectrum the response is increasing,
with two small narrow peaks occuring at qk ≈ 10q and qk ≈ 13q, and it reaches a max-
imum at qk ≈ 2 × 103, and after going down to a minimum right after kF /q it increases
again. This indicates that if we are able to produce probe ﬁelds with a signiﬁcant amount
of evanescent modes above kF /q, the present model is probably not sufﬁcient to describe
the ssp response (and maybe not sufﬁcient to describe the ppp response either). The last
of the curves in Fig. 15.1 represents the purely s-polarized case (sss). It has maxima at
qk/q = 0, and again at qk/q = n. Above qk = nq it falls off rapidly.

Looking at the qk/q-spectrum of the phase conjugated response in the other four com-
binations of polarization, depicted in Fig. 15.2, we see that both pairs have peaks in the
propagating regime of the qk/q-spectrum at the same places as the ppp and pps curves
of Fig. 15.1 had. Another peak appears when qk = nq, and in the purely evanescent part
of the qk/q-spectrum peaks appear at qk ≈ 10q and qk ≈ 13q, the same places as in the
ssp response shown in Fig. 15.1. After these two peaks the responses of the pss/sps-pair
increases until they reach their maximum at around qk = 5 × 103, after which they de-
crease again. This maximum is comparable in magnitude to the peaks in the propagating
end of the qk/q-spectrum. We observe that the two curves in each of the pairs shown
in Fig. 15.2 becomes identical for high values of qk, as they should from the previous
analysis. The spp/psp-pair of curves also starts increasing in magnitude in the high end
of the qk/q-spectrum showed. They reach their maximum at around qk = 2.5 × 103q,
after which the magnitude decreases again. In this case, however, the magnitude of this
maximum is some ﬁfteen orders of magnitude less than the magnitude of the peaks in
the propagating regime. The problem in the sps/pss-pair of curves is that the maximal
value is reached after the point qk = kF /q, and the conclusion must therefore be the same
as in the ssp case, namely that if the probe has components of signiﬁcance in the high

Chapter 15: Numerical results for a two-level quantum well

111

end of the qk/q-spectrum, then the model should probably be extended in one way or
another.

Continuing to the frequency plots, we observe from Fig. 15.3 that the two cases where
both pump ﬁelds are s-polarized has no resonances at all. Their decrease in magnitude
as the frequency increases is mainly due to the factor of w −3 occuring in the nonlinear
conductivity tensor. The ppp curve has a peak of high magnitude at w ≈ w 12/3, a small
one at w = w 12, and a large one again at w ≈ 1.1w 12. The pps curve has a peak of
small magnitude at w = 0.3w 12, two large ones at w ≈ w 12/3 and at w ≈ 1.1w 12, and
ﬁnally a small one at w ≈ 3.2w 12. The peaks around w ≈ w 12 probably arise from the
combination of the denominators in the nonlinear conductivity tensors, but none of the
peaks have been clearly identiﬁed from the formulas yet. Going to any of the two sides in
the frequency spectrum away from this group of resonances, the curves behave like the
sss and ssp curves, with the magnitude proportional to w −3. The frequency plots for the
two pairs of polarization combinations where the pump ﬁelds are differently polarized
(Fig. 15.4) have resonances with the approximate values of w /w 12 of 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 1,
1.1, and 2. Like in the previous case, these peaks have not been clearly identiﬁed from
the formulas yet. Again one might assume that the peaks at 1 and 1.1 arise directly from
(some of) the denominators in the nonlinear conductivity tensors. As before, outside of
the shown frequency range, the behaviour of the response is proportional to w −3. The
results presented in this chapter will be treated more thoroughly in a forthcoming paper.

112

Chapter 16

Discussion

In the past two chapter we have brieﬂy shown how to calculate the phase conjugated
response from a multilevel quantum well and given numerical results for a two-level
quantum well. As we concluded in the single-level quantum-well case, the assumption
of an ideal phase conjugator also does not hold for a two-level quantum-well phase
conjugator. In this case, however, it is not so much because of the efﬁciency in the high
end of the qk-spectrum, since in most of the cases shown in chapter 15 the efﬁciency in
the evanescent regime is not so much larger than in the propagating regime. It is more
because the two-level phase conjugator is much more efﬁcient for certain values of qk
than for the rest of the spectrum.

However, before we can give a full description of the phase conjugated response from
multi-level quantum wells, some aspects has to be addressed. Among the important ones
are the fact that we need to identify (i) which terms of the nonlinear conductivity tensor
that are dominating the phase conjugation response, and if it is possible by a careful
choice of the system to make different terms dominate. Furthermore (ii) it is desirable
to ﬁnd out more precisely which individual terms in the nonlinear conductivity tensor
gives rise to each of the peaks occuring in the curves in Figs. 15.1–15.4. Many other
things has to be investigated, for example (i) the behaviour of the response close to the
peaks in Figs. 15.1–15.4, both in the frequency spectrum and in the qk-spectrum, (ii) the
frequency dependence in general, and (iii) the response to sources with a large number of
Fourier components in the qk-spectrum, such as the quantum wire discussed in Chapter
12.

Summary of conclusions

We have developed a spatially nonlocal theoretical model of degenerate four-wave mix-
ing of electromagnetic ﬁelds on the mesoscopic length scale. We have analyzed the
physical processes involved in creating the DFWM response and identiﬁed the inde-
pendent nonzero elements of the related conductivity tensor for each type of process.
Following the more general treatment in real space we have specialized the treatment
to take into account only cases where translational invariance against displacements in
two of the three spatial dimensions occur, thereby favouring a description in which the
optical processes occur in surfaces and thin ﬁlms of condensed matter.

As a consequence of this choice we have transformed the response function into
Fourier space in two spatial coordinates, keeping the real-space coordinate in the third
dimension. From there, the emphasis has been laid on phase conjugation, although the
more general DFWM response tensor has been carried out in this mixed Fourier space
as well. The emphasis on phase conjugation was realized by the choice of letting two of
the interacting ﬁelds be spatially counterpropagating. Letting the two counterpropagat-
ing ﬁelds act as pump ﬁelds in the phase conjugation process, the third of the interacting
ﬁelds became what we have referred to as the probe ﬁeld.

The choice of a scattering geometry in which the pump ﬁelds were taken to be un-
damped plane waves traveling parallel to the translationally invariant plane resulted in a
description where the main effort could be concentrated on studying the response due to
the probe ﬁeld, thus letting the pump ﬁelds effectively being a part of the phase conjuga-
tor. We concluded that using different combinations of light polarized in the scattering
plane or perpendicular to this plane lead to different properties of the phase conjugated
ﬁeld compared to the incoming probe ﬁeld, including changes in polarization in some
cases.

Using the developed model on a single-level metallic quantum-well phase conjugator
we have shown that the phase-conjugation reﬂection coefﬁcient behaves quite differently
from the uniform reﬂection coefﬁcient that has often been assumed in previous studies
where evanescent components have been included (Agarwal and Gupta 1995; Keller
1992). The response in the high end of the qk-spectrum turned out to be as much as ten
orders of magnitude larger than in the propagating regime. Subsequently, it was shown
that by use of the single-level phase conjugator it was possible to phase conjugate light
emitted from a subwavelength source in the vicinity of the phase conjugator, and that
the phase conjugated light at the plane parallel to the phase conjugator, where the source
has been placed, has a subwavelength distance between the minima in the intensity.
Consistent with another recent prediction (Bozhevolnyi 1997; Bozhevolnyi and Vohnsen
1997) we have observed that the smallest distance between the two minima surrounding
the main lobe in the phase conjugated ﬁeld occur at the surface of the phase conjugator.
The theoretical model was concluded with a description of a quantum well with an
arbitrary number of bound states, followed by a numerical calculation of the response
from a two-level quantum well. We have shown that also the two-level quantum well
does not come close to an ideal phase conjugator with a uniform reﬂection coefﬁcient

Part VI: Closing remarks

117

in the qk-spectrum. Furthermore, it does not behave the same way as the single-level
quantum well, even though the combinations of polarization for the interacting ﬁelds that
gives a p-polarized response lead to similar results in the high end of the qk-spectrum. In
the low end of the qk-spectrum the phase conjugated response from a two-level quantum
well is several orders of magnitude stronger in a small number of very narrow ranges in
qk than in the rest.

Finally, we concluded that if one is able to excite the two-level quantum well in the
qk-range around the point of the Fermi wave number the present model could prove
insufﬁcient, because the maximum value of the phase conjugation reﬂection coefﬁcient
in the high end of the qk-spectrum in several cases is above the Fermi wave number.

Discussion and outlook

With respect to the single-level quantum well several properties would be interesting to
examine from a fundamental point of view, including (i) the response in the far-infrared
and ultraviolet parts of the frequency spectrum, (ii) how the response can be divided into
an electrostatic and an electrodynamic part, (iii) how the width of the phase conjugated
focus from a quantum wire scales with the wavelength of the electromagnetic ﬁeld used
in the interaction, and (iv) the problem of a three-dimensional source.

For the two-level quantum well plenty of work remains to be done before it would
be wise to take up some of the above-mentioned properties. First of all, we have to
determine how much each of the terms in the nonlinear conductivity tensor contributes to
the phase conjugated response. Also, the problem of phase conjugating a broad angular
band should be addressed in order to study, for instance, focusing of light in front of a
two-level phase conjugator.

The problem of focusing has to be addressed more carefully, since the present study
has revealed only that when the mesoscopic source is moved closer to the phase conjuga-
tor the focus is narrowed. I imagine that this problem could be addressed properly using
a pure engineering approach to make an adjustment of the present model by (i) aban-
doning the inﬁnite barrier model by insertion of a more sophisticated potential across
the barrier, and (ii) abandoning the point-source description of the probe ﬁeld. Thereby
one would also be able to discuss the problem of resolution in a near-ﬁeld optical micro-
scope.

Furthermore, it could be interesting to establish a model which provides a tempo-
ral resolution. It could be used to study, for example, the time delay and distortion of
an electromagnetic pulse (wave packet) being phase conjugated, initially using, for ex-
ample, plane waves as pumps, and ultimately to give an understanding of four-wave
mixing using pulsed interacting ﬁelds. Such a model would provide a framework for a
description of time-resolved optical phase conjugation in, for example, communications
systems.

On the more sophisticated fundamental side it could be interesting to investigate the
phase conjugated response when the phase conjugator is, for example, a mesoscopic
ring, cylinder, sphere, or a quantum wire. Another possibility is to take into account

118

Part VI: Closing remarks

spin effects in order to treat the phase conjugation response from magnetic materials.
We also believe that there is a connection between the model for electromagnetic phase
conjugation presented in this work and phase conjugation of electrons and atoms [for an
introduction to atomic phase conjugation and nonlinear atom optics, see Lenz, Meystre,
and Wright (1993, 1994) and Goldstein, Pl¨attner, and Meystre (1995)].

A problem that has to be taken into account when using the present formulation to
describe nonlinear optical processes is the apparantly divergent behaviour in the long-
wavelength (low-frequency) limit stemming (in third-order problems) from the w −3-term
in the beginning of the nonlinear conductivity tensor. This problem is a general one in
the theoretical model, and although the linear problem has been solved (Keller 1996a),
the problem has still not been solved for any nonlinear case, including DFWM.

If time permits, I shall substantiate on some of these points in future work. Otherwise,

it will be left for others to do.

We are very lucky to live in an age in which we are still making discoveries.

Appendix A

Calculation of linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors in
two-dimensionally translational invariant systems [(z;~qk)-space]

In this appendix I present a calculation of linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors suit-
able for calculation of the linear and nonlinear current densities in a physical system with
translational invariance only in the x and y directions of the Cartesian x-y-z-coordinate
system. The basic ingredients in this calculation consists of (i) the Fourier integral rep-
resentation of the vector potential in the x- and y-coordinates given by Eq. (8.1), (ii) the
inverse relation for the current densities linear in the cyclic frequency w
(appeared as
Eq. (8.2)), (iii) the basis set of the wave functions taken on the form of Eq. (8.9), and
(iv) the corresponding transition current density in Eq. (8.14). Using these ingredients
we start from the three-dimensional expressions in real space, which in the linear case
are given by Eq. (4.9) with insertion of Eqs. (6.6)–(6.7) and in the nonlinear case are
given by Eq. (4.10) with insertion of Eqs. (6.8)–(6.14). The results of these calcula-
tions are presented as expressions for the individual matrix elements according to the
deﬁnitions given by Eq. (8.3) for the linear conductivity tensor and Eq. (8.8) for the non-
linear conductivity tensor, the cyclic transition frequencies being expressed in the form
of Eq. (8.12).

For convenience, we in the following treatment divide the linear current density into
two parts following the two processes shown in Fig. 5.1. If we deﬁne the linear cur-
rent density as Ji(z;~qk) = (cid:229)
j Ji j(z;~qk), the result of calculating the linear conductiv-
ity tensor is presented as the individual nonzero matrix elements corresponding to the
symmetry analysis presented in Chapter 6. Like in the linear case, it is convenient
in the nonlinear case to deﬁne the nonlinear current density as Ji(~r ) ≡ (cid:229)
jkh Ji jkh(~r ),
with Ji jkh(~r ) = X
i jkh(~r,~r ′,~r ′′,~r ′′′)Ah(~r ′′′)Ak(~r ′′)A j(~r ′), and then split the treatment of
the nonlinear current density in such a way that each of the processes mentioned in
Fig. 5.2 is treated separately.

A.1 Linear process A

From Eq. (6.6) we have the xx element of part A of the linear current, in which we insert
the expressions for the wave function and the vector potential in the two-dimensional

Of the three integrals over~k

the DFWM pump ﬁelds deﬁned by Eqs. (A.12) and (A.13) into Eq. (A.32), the integrals

same reason as before, and on the form of Eq. (8.8), the PCDFWM conductivity tensor
part F appears as Eq. (8.22).

A.9 Nonlinear process G

Inserting Eq. (6.14) into Eq. (4.10), we take element i jkh of part G of the nonlinear
current density. In the result we insert the expressions for the wave function, the vector
potential and the transition current density in the two-dimensional Fourier representation
[Eqs. (8.9), (8.1) and (8.14), respectively]. Then by use of Eq. (8.2) we ﬁnd

lowed by solution to the integral over q′

to the integrals over ~k

Principal analytic solution
k in the low temperature limit

In this appendix we discuss the analytic solution to the integrals over~k
k appearing in the
linear and nonlinear conductivity tensor. The discussion is limited to cover the low tem-
perature limit, and it is presented as a principal solution to all integrals over~k
k appearing
in Eqs. (8.15)–(8.23).

B.1 General type of integrals

Every integral over ~k
k in both the linear conductivity tensor, Eqs. (8.15) and (8.16), and
the nonlinear conductivity tensor, Eqs. (8.17)–(8.23), can when scattering takes place in
the x-z-plane be expressed as a sum over terms of the general type
x k q
k p
y fn(~k
k + s~ex)
k=1[akk x + bk]

F b
pq(n, {a}, {b}, s) =

dk xdk y,

(B.1)

Z Z

where p, k, b are nonnegative integers, and q is an even nonnegative integer. The func-
tions in general depends on (i) the quantum number n, which is a positive nonzero in-
teger, (ii) a set of real quantities, {a} ≡ {a1, . . . , ab } appearing in front of the integra-
tion variable k x in the denominator, (iii) a set of complex nonzero quantities, {b} ≡
{b1, . . . , bb } apearing as the other quantity in each term of the denominator, and (iv) the
real quantity s representing the displacement of the center of the Fermi-Dirac distribu-
tion function from (k x, k y) = (0, 0). The quantity s together with each element in the set
{a} is in general a function of the parallel components of the probe and pump wavevec-
tors, ~qk and~kk. Each element in the set {b} is furthermore a function of t , the relaxation
time.

In the low temperature limit the Fermi-Dirac distribution function is zero outside the
Fermi sphere and equal to one inside, and it is therefore advantageous to shift k x by −s,
followed by a one-to-one mapping of the x-y-plane into polar coordinates (r-q -plane).
Using in this way k x = r cos q
, and thus dk xdk y = rdq dr, the indeﬁnite
integral in Eq. (B.1) is turned into the deﬁnite integral

Figure B.1: Distribution of the elements of the nonlinear conductivity tensor in terms of p and
q. In one element (△) the terms appear with (p, q) = (0, 0). In six elements (⊗) the terms appear
with (p, q) = (0, 2). In one element (⋆) the terms appear with (p, q) = (0, 4). In four elements
(+) the terms appear with (p, q) ∈ {(1, 0), (0, 0)}. In twelve elements (◦) the terms appear with
(p, q) ∈ {(1, 2), (0, 2)}. In six elements (•) the terms appear with (p, q) ∈ {(2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0)}.
In six elements (×) the terms appear with (p, q) ∈ {(2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2)}. In four elements (⊕) the
terms appear with (p, q) ∈ {(3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0)}. The ﬁnal element (▽) the terms appear
with (p, q){(4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0)}. Elements labelled with a ‘·’ are zero.

The quantity a (n) =
F − (p n/d)2 is the radius of the (two-dimensional) Fermi circle
k2
for state n, given by Eq. (D.20). The Fermi wavenumber kF obeys the relation kF > p n/d,
since the Fermi-Dirac distribution function is zero for kF < p n/d, and thus in that case
the integral would vanish.

B.2 Speciﬁc integrals to be solved

The necessary combinations of p and q in Eq. (B.2) to be calculated in order to solve
the integrals over ~k
k in the nonlinear conductivity tensor are summarized in Fig. B.1.
From Fig. B.1 we observe that a total of nine different combinations of p and q need
to be calculated, namely when (p, q) takes the values (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2),
(2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), or (4, 0), and it is seen from Eqs. (8.15)–(8.23) that b can take the
values b ∈ {1, 2, 3}. However, the complexity of the total solution can be reduced, since
functions with b = 2 can be expressed in terms of functions with b = 1 in the following

provided ak 6= 0, k ∈ {1, 2, 3}. If any ak, for instance a1, becomes zero, we observe from
Eq. (B.2) that the order of the denominator becomes smaller by one. This implies in
Eq. (B.3) that F 2
pq(n, a2, b2, s)/b1. The similar conclusion with
respect to Eq. (B.4) is F 3
pq(n, a2, a3, b2, b3, s)/b1. A corre-
sponding reduction applies for any other ak = 0 in Eqs. (B.3) and (B.4).

pq(n, 0, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, s) = F 2

pq(n, 0, a2, b1, b2, s) = F 1

As a consequence of Eqs. (B.3) and (B.4), the integrals appearing in Eqs. (8.15)–

(8.23) can now be written in terms of functions of the type

solution of Eq. (B.5), we will also drop the reference to n for brevity, letting a ≡ a (n).

B.3 Solution when a = 0

Before carrying on with the solution to Eq. (B.5) in the appropriate cases, we take a look
at it in the case where a = 0 (as would be the case in the local limit, for example). Then
the only term left in the denominator is b, which is constant with respect to the integration
variables. The solution to the remaining thus becomes trivial, with the results

combinations of p and q we need. To solve Eq. (B.5), let us make the substitutions

Using Eqs. (B.72)–(B.80) together with Eqs. (B.3) and (B.4) when they are needed,
the solution to the integrals appearing in Eqs. (8.15)–(8.23), (10.5), (10.6), (10.13), and
(14.11)–(14.14) are obtained in a straightforward manner. They can be found on detailed

Analytic solution to the integrals over~k

k appearing in the
conductivity tensors when scattering takes place in the x-z-plane

Taking a close look at the expressions for the different nonlinear conductivity tensor parts
in Eqs. (8.17)–(8.23) we observe by insertion of the transition current density given by
Eq. (8.14) that they can be separated into two independent parts. One of these parts
depends solely on ~k
k and the other part depends only on z. In the remaining of this
Appendix they will be denoted by x and Z , respectively. The quantity x can be solved
according to the solution scheme given in Appendix B, and the explicit solution will
therefore in the following be given in terms of the functions solved in Appendix B.
Furthermore it is possible to split the z-dependent part into independent functions of
each z-coordinate. Since the z-dependence involves only the wave functions, we deﬁne
the following three new quantities

nm(z) = Z y
Z x
nm(z) = y ∗
Z z

nm(z) = y ∗
n(z)
¶ z

m(z)

m(z)y n(z),
− y n(z)

∗
m(z)
¶ z

,

in order to reduce the expressions in the following.

As the ﬁrst step in preparing the solutions to the integrals over ~k

k we identify the
transition frequencies occuring in the nonlinear conductivity tensor parts. Each of these
transition frequencies can on general form be written

w nm(~k

k +~b ,~k

k +~g ) =

2k x(b x − g x) + b 2

and again they are written in terms of a set of functions F that vary from element to
element. As was the case in the previous sections, these functions are determined from
the z-independent parts of the transition current densities appearing in X

.

In passing we should notice that parts (Ga1) and (Gc2) has b = 2 because of the pure
interband transition appearing in one of their denominators, while parts (Ga2), (Gb),
and (Gc1) has b = 3 since all their transitions are mixed interband/intraband transitions,
we observe that a lot of F functions are equal. In the simplest case, we observe

C.8 The Z coefﬁcients with uniform pump ﬁeld amplitudes

If the pump ﬁelds have uniform amplitudes along the z-axis, we take the local limit in
the two coordinates z′′′ and z′′ in the Z coefﬁcients, such that in general we may write,

Z (z, z′) =

Z (z, z′, z′′, z′′′)dz′′′dz′′,

ZZ

and thus

X (z, z′;~qk,~kk) =

X (z, z′, z′′, z′′′;~qk,~kk)dz′′′dz′′.

ZZ

Using an orthogonal set of wave functions, parity teaches that the integrals over x- and
y-components gives

Z x

nm(z)dz =

nm(z)dz = d nm,
Z y

Z

Z

where d nm is the Kronecker delta. The only question left is the z-components, which may
be determined as soon as the wave functions for the system is known. Then part A of
the nonlinear conductivity tensor does not contribute to the phase conjugated response
because of the result of integration over z′′. For the same reason, part E vanish, since
the pure interband terms vanish by themselves, and the rest of part Ea becomes equal
in magnitude to the rest of part Eb, but with the opposite sign. All other terms still
contribute to the response.

C.8.1 Inﬁnite barrier quantum well

If we choose a quantum well within the inﬁnite barrier model with boundaries at 0 and
−d as the source, then we ﬁnd

nm (z) are independent, the result is written as a prod-

C.8.2 Probe with a single wavevector

If we take the probe ﬁeld as ~E(z′;~qk) = ~Eeiq⊥z′ and thus ~E ∗(z′;~qk) = ~E ∗e−iq⊥z′, then we

to indicate that it is modiﬁed from the original Z quantities.

C.10 The local limit in three coordinates

In the local limit, the vector potentials (and electric ﬁelds) are independent of their z-
coordinate, and thus the nonlinear conductivity tensor alone has to be integrated over the

Fermi energy, quantum well thickness, and a (n)

The number of electrons n(~r) in a system where the spin energies are degenerate can be
written

where the number 2 represents the degeneracy of the spin energies, and the sum runs
over all electron states in the system multiplied by the probability of ﬁnding an electron
in that state. This probability is given as a Fermi-Dirac distribution

n(~r) = 2(cid:229)

fN =

1 + exp((E N − µ)/(kBT ))

,

where E N is the energy of the electron in state N, µ is the chemical potential, kB is
Boltzmann’s constant and T is the absolute temperature.

We will now look at the case where we have two-dimensional translational invariance
along the x-y-plane. In this case the wave function gives plane-wave solutions in the
direction of the plane,

Y N(~r) =

From this equation, the limits on the thickness of the quantum well can be determined
if we know the number of bound states we want below the Fermi level, the minimal
thickness for the quantum well to have n levels being determined from the simple relation
E F = e n, and thus the maximal thickness can be determined from E F = e n+1, since it
has the same limit value as the minimal thickness to obtain n + 1 bound states. Thus, for
n bound states below the Fermi level,

which gives the related minimal and maximal thicknesses to have these n bound states

Dansk resum´e

For at studere den mulige fasekonjugation af optiske nærfelter er det nødvendigt at
g˚a ud over den langsomtvarierende indhyldningskurve approksimation samt den elek-
triske dipoltilnærmelse, der normalt anvendes i fasekonjugationsstudier hvor rumligt
udæmpede (eller i det mindste svagt dæmpede) svingninger blandes. I den foreliggende
afhandling præsenteres en vilk˚arlig-fase tilnærmet beregning af den ulineære og ikke-
lokale optiske responstensor der beskriver den ulinerære strømtæthed af tredie orden,
som genereres af ﬁrebølgeblanding i en uensartet elektrongas. Beskrivelsen er baseret
p˚a en halvklassisk model, hvori det elektromagnetiske felt antages at være en klassisk
størrelse og udgangspunktet er bevægelsesligningen for tæthedsmatrix-operatoren. Vek-
selvirknings Hamilton-operatoren anvendes i dens minimale koblingsform, og den inde-
holder det led i strømtæthedsoperatoren, der er proportionalt med det p˚atrykte vektor-
potential. Ved brug af denne formalisme er den rumlige struktur af systemets optiske
respons beskrevet ved hjælp af mikroskopiske overgangsstrømtætheder. Beregningen
inkluderer derfor b˚ade bidrag fra ~p · ~A og ~A · ~A leddene i vekselvirknings-Hamilton-
operatoren. Det er vist at der introduceres nogle vigtige fænomener, som er begrebs-
mæssigt forskellige fra de der har deres oprindelse i ~p · ~A-leddet, ved at inkludere ~A · ~A
leddet i vekselvirknings Hamilton-operatoren. For at fremhæve den fysiske mening af de
forskellige processer er koblingerne mellem observationspunkter for feltet og strømtæt-
heden præsenteret i form af diagrammer. Resultatet af en analyse af tensorsymmetrierne,
der er tilknyttet ~p · ~A og ~A · ~A vekselvirkningerne er summeret i form af symmetriske-
maer for fasekonjugationsprocessen. Den teoretiske model efterfølges af en beregning
af det fasekonjugerede respons fra en et-niveau metallisk kvantebrønd. Et-niveau kvan-
tebrønden repræsenterer den simplest mulige konﬁguration en kvantebrønds-fasekonju-
gator kan have. Ydermere er den et interessant objekt, idet dens optiske respons ikke
indeholder noget dipol-led. Diskussionen af responset er baseret p˚a stimulering af pro-
cessen ved brug af lys, der er polariseret enten i spredningsplanet eller vinkelret p˚a spred-
ningsplanet. Det vises, at fasekonjugationsprocessen er ekstremt effektiv i det dæm-
pede omr˚ade af bølgevektor-spektret. Dernæst anskues problemet med at generere plane
bølger til excitation i den høje ende af det dæmpede spektrum, og vi diskuterer brugen af
en bredb˚andskilde (i vinkelspektret) til at stimulere processen. En s˚adan bredb˚andskilde
kan være en kvantetr˚ad, og det fasekonjugerede vinkelspektrum fra en kvantetr˚ad præ-
senteres og diskuteres. Kvantetr˚adens subbølgelængde størrelse gør den en mulig kandi-
dat til en diskussion af den mulige rumlige komprimering af lys, og rumlig begrænsning
af lys foran en et-niveau metallisk kvantebrøndsfasekonjugator er diskuteret i to dimen-
sioner. Det retfærdiggøres at man ved et passende valg af strømtæthedens orientering
i kvantetr˚aden kan opn˚a en feltkomprimering, der er væsentligt p˚a den anden side af
Rayleighs grænseværdi. Afhandlingen afsluttes med en kort beskrivelse af det mere
generelle tilfælde, hvor kvantebrønden tillades at have mere end en energi-egentilstand.
Numeriske resultater, der viser responset hvis en to-niveau kvantebrønd anvendes som
fasekonjugerende medium, er præsenteret og diskuteret.

In order to study the possible phase conjugation of optical near-ﬁelds, it is necessary to go
beyond the slowly varying envelope- and electric dipole approximations that are normally
applied in phase conjugation studies where spatially non-decaying (or at least slowly decay-
ing) modes are mixed. In the present dissertation a random-phase-approximation calculation
of the nonlocal nonlinear optical response tensor describing the third order nonlinear cur-
rent density generated by degenerate four-wave mixing in an inhomogeneous electron gas
is established. The description is based on a semi-classical approach, in which the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld is considered as a classical quantity, and the starting point is the equation of
motion for the density matrix operator. The interaction Hamiltonian is taken in its minimal
coupling form, and it includes the term in the current density operator which is proportional
to the prevailing vector potential. Using this formalism the spatial structure of the optical
response of the system is described in terms of the microscopic transition current densities.
The calculation thus includes contributions originating from both the ~p · ~A and ~A · ~A terms
in the interaction Hamiltonian. It is demonstrated that inclusion of the ~A · ~A term in the in-
teraction Hamiltonian introduces some important phenomena that are conceptually different
from those originating in the ~p · ~A part. To emphasize the physical meaning of the various
processes, the couplings between observation points for the ﬁeld and the current density is
presented in a diagrammatic form. The result of an analysis of the tensor symmetries asso-
ciated with the ~p · ~A and ~A · ~A interactions are summarized in terms of symmetry schemes
for the phase conjugation process. The theoretical model is followed by a calculation of
the phase conjugated response from a single-level metallic quantum well. The single-level
quantum well represents the simplest possible conﬁguration of a quantum-well phase con-
jugator. Furthermore, it is an interesting object, since its optical response contains no dipole
terms. The discussion of the response is based on the use of light that is polarized either
in the scattering plane or perpendicular to the scattering plane to excite the process. It is
demonstrated that the phase conjugation process is extremely efﬁcient in the evanescent
regime of the wavevector spectrum. We address the problem of plane-wave excitation in the
high wavenumber end of the evanescent regime and discuss the use of a broadband source
to excite the process. One possible broad angular band source is a quantum wire, and the
phase conjugated angular spectrum from a quantum wire is presented and discussed. The
subwavelength size of the quantum wire makes it a possible candidate for discussion of con-
ﬁnement of light, and the conﬁnement of light in two dimensions in front of a single-level
metallic quantum-well phase conjugator is discussed. It is justiﬁed that by a proper choice
of orientation of the current in the quantum wire a ﬁeld compression substantially beyond
the Rayleigh limit is obtained. The thesis is concluded with a short description of the more
general case where the quantum well is allowed to have more than one energy eigenstate,
and numerical results showing the response from a two-level quantum well as the phase
conjugating medium are presented and discussed.

Abstract

Manufacturing end-of-ﬁber optical components able to realize optical functions ranging from

a simple lens to more complex functions such as mode selective components is a decisive but a

priori complex task owing to the ﬁber core dimensions. Eﬀective low cost methods allowing to

grow polymer components by free-radical photopolymerization using the light coming out of the

ﬁber have recently been reported. A novel phenomenological model of the photopolymerization

process underlying is here given and used to simulate the polymer component growth in a three

dimensional time-resolved manner. The simulations results are thus used to understand and

optimize the component growth conditions, focusing particularly on the role of oxygen either

present in the atmosphere or dissolved in the solution.

I.

INTRODUCTION

During the past decades, numerous methods for integrating microlenses on optical ﬁbers

(MOFs) have been reviewed. MOFs have been manufactured by various methods such as

electric arc melting[1] laser micromachining[2], chemical etching[3] and photolithography[4,

5, 6]. Nevertheless, these procedures are time and energy consuming and imply stringent

control of the experimental parameters.

A novel low cost manufacturing technique based on free-radical photopolymerization[7]

was recently reported[8, 9, 10, 11]. It relies on photopolymerization within a photosensitive

droplet attached to a cleaved ﬁber end thanks to surface tension. A beam of visible green

light introduced at the other end of the ﬁber emerges beneath the droplet and thus initiates

polymerization.

As recent works show[12, 13, 14], light propagating in a photosensitive solution in which

the refractive index of the polymer is higher than that of the initial formulation can ex-

perience self-focusing and propagate in a spatial soliton manner as it is the case in other

materials such as Kerr[15] or photorefractive media[16, 17]. Therefore, since the polymer

component remains ﬁrmly attached to the optical ﬁber thanks to hydrogen bonds, it can be

inferred that the component grown following this procedure will be an extension of the ﬁber

core and that its optical function will be governed by its index and shape. In the following,

we will thus refer to it as polymer tip.

In the following, a thorough 3D time resolved phenomenological model of this component

growth on a cleaved ﬁber end is proposed. Starting with a review of the experimental

3

procedure, an abstract model able to describe the local polymerization rate will be presented,

eventually leading to the growth modelling thanks to the coupling with a standard Beam

Propagation Method[18, 19, 20]. It is thus followed by the analysis of the polymer tip growth

conditions through simulation in order to understand and master the tip shape and optical

function. The model presented in this paper is based on previously published preliminary

work [8, 9] and extends the previous models so as to allow their quantitative testing again

experimental data.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DESCRIPTION

A. Photosensitivive solution

1. Composition

The photopolymerizable solution used in this work was introduced in previous papers

[21, 22]. It is made of three basic components: a sensitizer dye, an amine cosynergist, and a

multifunctional acrylate monomer, pentaerythritoltriacrylate (PETIA) used as received from

the supplier. After irradiation, this component forms the backbone of the polymer network.

The cosynergist was methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), while eosin Y (2’,4’,5’,7’-tetrabromo-

ﬂuorescein disodium salt) was used as sensitizer dye. This system was developed mainly

because of its high sensitivity in the spectral region going from 450 to 550 nm (maximum at

530 nm). In particular, this formulation is specially suited to be irradiated by an argon ion

laser (514 or 488 nm), a frequency doubled Nd/YAG laser (532 nm) or a green He-Ne laser

at 543.5 nm which we have used in the experiments described in this paper. In addition,

4

this liquid system is very ﬂexible, since it is possible to modify the nature or the proportions

of the diﬀerent components in order to adjust the physical and chemical properties of the

formulation (viscosity, polymerization threshold energy, etc.). Results reported in this paper

were obtained with mixtures containing 3 wt.% eosin and 8 wt.% methyldiethanolamine.

2. Photopolymerization reaction

After absorption of actinic light by eosin, the triplet state of the dye reacts with the

amine to form radicals. Radicals initiate the polymerization of the monomer. Owing to the

monomer multifunctionality, the polymer quickly develops into a 3D network. The nonpoly-

merized formulation stays liquid and can be easily washed out with solvent, such as ethanol,

leaving the polymerized part as a quasi-homogeneous transparent polymer component.

However, as previous studies of this photopolymerization process have shown[23], oxygen

dissolved within the formulation plays an inhibiting role in the photo-initiation process. As

we will see in the following, the oxygen inhibition activity plays a determinant role in the

polymer tip growth and thus largely governs its shape and optical function.

B. Experimental set-up

As is depicted in Fig.1, the experimental bench set up for the growth of the polymer tip is

fairly simple and thus quite low cost. It basically consists in dipping a cleaved optical ﬁber

in a photosensitive solution such as the one described above so as to obtain a hemispherical

droplet attached to the end of the ﬁber by mere surface tension. Coupling a green laser light

5

(for instance a He-Ne laser at a wavelength of 543.5 nm) to the other end of the ﬁber allows

light to emerge below the droplet and initiate polymerization.

The rest of the process consists in adjusting laser power to the desired value and in letting

the polymerization occur during the desired exposure time. The resulting polymer tip is

still embedded in a non-polymerized monomer solution that can be cleansed by ethanol, for

instance, thus leaving the polymer tip standing alone ﬁrmly attached to the ﬁber end.

C. Sample results and applications

An example of the obtained polymer tip is shown on Fig.2 with a detail shown on Fig.3.

As expected, the tip looks like an extension of the ﬁber core and has a length roughly equal

to the thickness of the surface tension driven droplet in which its growth took place. On

the contrary, the curvature radius of its end is signiﬁcantly smaller than that of the droplet.

Indeed, if they were equal, the tip end would, at that scale, seem rigorously ﬂat. This

discrepancy will be thoroughly investigated in the following.

Fig.4 shows the polymer tip grown from a LP21 ﬁber mode. As can be seen, its shape is a

real 3D mold of the electromagnetic intensity emerging from the optical ﬁber. Preliminary

experiments show that this particular tip is a mode selective component: if a plane wave is

shone onto it, the excited mode within the ﬁber happens to be the LP21 mode which created

the tip.

Other applications based either on the tip optical or mechanical properties can be fore-

seen. As will be published elsewhere, the polymer tip is able to enhance laser diode to

ﬁber coupling in a signiﬁcant way. Furthermore, the polymer nature of this tip makes it an

6

attractive low cost non breakable tip for Scanning Near Field Optical Microscopy.

III. PHENOMENOLOGICAL MODEL

A. Photopolymerization rate empirical model

The ﬁrst step of the photopolymerization consists in a photosensitization of the dye —

eosin in our case— which is excited in its triplet state by the incoming light. This reaction

is followed by radical formation which consists in an electron transfer from the amine to the

dye, followed by proton transfer. The polymerization is thus initiated and can propagate

into a 3D polymer network which tends to solidify the solution.

This reaction main pathway has however to compete with two side reactions involving

O2 which thus inhibits the polymerization process.

Indeed, O2 is able to deactivate the

dye triplet state, thus impairing polymerization. It can also peroxydate the free radicals

and thus rapidly terminate the polymer chain[23]. Furthermore, these two reactions have

been found[24] to be much more probable than the polymerization process. Therefore, the

deactivation reactions will dominate the polymerization process until O2 has disappeared

from the solution. This is only a very crude model since it does not take into account O2

diﬀusion within the solution towards O2 depleted region. However, this local model can be

a good start because it can be expressed in terms of threshold energy.

The threshold energy is in this case an energy density above which the time integrated

optical energy density at a given point in space —which we will call the accumulated energy

Eacc in the following— has to grow before polymerization can start. It is directly linked

7

to the concentration of dissolved O2 in the formulation to which it is roughly proportional.

Indeed, a typical polymerization response curve is shown on Fig.5 and exhibits the threshold

energy Es.

B. Complete 3D model of light propagation

In view of this simple model, the simulation of the growth of the polymer tip requires on

the one hand the measurement of the response curve as is given in Fig.5 and on the other

hand the calculation of the accumulated energy Eacc for every point in space within the

solution. The latter can be done knowing the electromagnetic ﬁeld on the ﬁber end[25] and

using a standard Beam Propagation Method (BPM) based on Fourier Transforms[18, 20, 26].

The former allows to get access to the values of the threshold energy Es, the maximum

index variation dn and to the polymerization rate linked to the derivative of the curve of

Fig.5 with respect to the accumulated energy. Measurement methods can be found in the

litterature[23, 27]. As will be presented in section III, the phenomenological parameters not

directly accessible via measurements (such as Cs and Csmax of equation 5 ) are going to be

deduced by ﬁtting the simulations to experimental results.

The accumulated energy Eacc is then computed iteratively using the BPM to know the

energy density. The polymerization response curve is then used to evaluate the change in

the refraction index at every point in space, thus providing data for the next BPM which

will correspond to the next step in time.

As the polymerization response curve used in the simulation is the results of experimental

measurements, we have introduced an empirical model which allows its description as a

8

function of the threshold energy Es, the polymerization rate immediately after the threshold

—related to α— and the maximum index variation dn:

△n = dn × tanh

× h (Eacc − Es)

(1)

Eacc − Es
αEs

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

where h is the Heaviside unit step function.

Let us point out here that we have taken into account the fact that the polymerization

eﬃciency does depend on the instant local intensity by adding a multiplier β to the local

intensity whose value is taken between 0 and 1 corresponding respectively to null eﬃciency

and maximum one. However, at the typical intensities we use —2,5mW within the ﬁber

core—, the value of β is saturated to 1[23].

After a number of steps corresponding to the desired exposure time, this process yields

a 3D matrix describing the refraction index variation in space. The shape of the polymer

tip which is obtained after cleansing is then described by the polymer refraction index np (

1.51 ≤ np ≤ 1.52 after irradiation, the index of the photopolymerizable being around 1.48

[27]). The shape of the tip is thus given by the surface corresponding to a refraction index

constant value equal to np. The typical tip shape obtained with this procedure is shown on

Fig.6.

The curvature of the hemispherical droplet is not taken into account in the simulation

process. This is justiﬁed by the fact that the radius of curvature of the droplet (larger than

the 125 microns ﬁber diameter) is much larger than the simulation window (on the order

of ﬁber core, a few microns). Therefore, the hemispherical droplet is assumed ﬂat in the

simulation region. Furthermore, the droplet thickness of about 35 microns in the simulation

9

region has been measured through electron beam microscopy.

One particular aspect of the above described simulation scheme is that it is resolved in

both 3D space and time. This means that light density and thus polymerization degree is al-

lowed to be non-constant through time and non-uniform through space. Particularly, Figure

6, as all simulation ﬁgures, has been computed while taking into account the inhomogeneous

intensity distribution resulting from the propagation of a Gaussian beam.

C. Dye photo-bleaching

Our model also needs to consider the loss in absorption due to the consumption of absorb-

ing dye that we must take into account in the BPM process. We have taken into account

this phenomenon known as photobleaching in a similar way as the polymerization state.

Experimental measurements allow to model phenomenologically the absorption represented

by γ, the absorption coeﬃcient, as a function of the accumulated energy Eacc at every point

of the 3D space in the following way[28]:

1
d

γ =

ln

1 +

 

edγ0 − 1
Eacc
κ

e

!

(2)

where d is the measurement sample thickness (i.e. an experimental constant), γ0 the ini-

tial absorption coeﬃcient of the solution and κ a characteristic energy density determined

experimentally.

Our simulations results show that this photobleaching curve has to be determined by a

careful experiment as depicted in the litterature[28] for it greatly inﬂuences the polymer tip

10

shape. In our case, the main parameter κ has been measured to 12.5W/cm2.

D. Oxygen diﬀusion within the solution

A simple qualitative comparison between Fig.3 and Fig.6 reveals a strong discrepancy

between the experimental results and the simulation: the former show a rounded tip with a

radius of curvature that goes down to the wavelength in particular experimental conditions

whereas the latter evidences a ﬂat end polymer tip.

This discrepancy cannot be attributed to the curvature of the solution droplet because

it is several orders of magnitude larger so that the polymer tip would indeed look ﬂat if

the curvature was only due to surface tension. Its origin has to be looked for into what the

model does not account for: O2 diﬀusion into and within the droplet.

The major source of O2 is the growth atmosphere which is generally the ambient atmo-

sphere. Diﬀusion has then to be accounted for from the droplet surface into the solution for

a few tenth of microns of length during the exposure time. The model presented here does

not introduce the classical diﬀusion Fick law to model O2 diﬀusion for two reasons. The ﬁrst

one is a question of computational complexity, which would grow too high for a reasonable

3D model to be developed. The second one is that the corresponding equation is too com-

plicated. The spatially inhomogeneous incident intensity distribution in the formulation at

the end of the ﬁber gives rise to a corresponding nonuniform distribution of both the viscos-

ity and the reactives and photoproducts in the droplet. In particular, the inhomogeneities

in the oxygen composition of the droplet should be taken into account, owing to diﬀerent

reactions with transient species and, simultaneously, to mass diﬀusion.

11

It is however possible to infer a phenomenological model from the experiments. Con-

sidering that the main process is the diﬀusion of O2 from an inﬁnite source into a medium

with a homogeneous viscosity constant, the O2 concentration can be expected to follow an

exponential law from a given concentration at the droplet surface. The consequence on

the above described model is a spatial modulation of the threshold energy Es following O2

concentration. This modulation can be described as follows:

Csmax × exp

z − d
Ddif f !

 

where Csmax is linked to O2 atmospheric concentration on the droplet surface and Ddif f is

called the diﬀusion length. d is the droplet thickness and z the position of the current point

in space counted from the ﬁber end.

The same analysis can be carried out in the direction transverse to the beam propagation

direction: when the beam propagates and initiates polymerization, it consumes oxygen.

Following Fick’s diﬀusion law, the O2 concentration gradient between the beam path and

outside the beam path leads to an inward O2 ﬂux towards the center of the beam. This will

impair polymerization on the beam wings. We propose to model this the same way with a

spatial modulation in the threshold energy as follows:

where Csmax2 is linked to O2 concentration within the droplet and Ddif f 2 is a diﬀusion length

— a priori equal to Ddif f . d2 is the beam width on the order of the core radius and r the

position of the current point in space counted from the beam axis. This phenomenological

Csmax2 × exp

r − d2
Ddif f 2 !

 

12

(3)

(4)

model can be understood easily if the beam is considered to be homogeneous with a radius

equal to d2. However, if one needs to account for the Gaussian shape of the beam, this simple

model needs to be adapted to account for the fact that O2 depletion varies continuously,

potential leading to a raise in the threshold energy in the center of the beam by opposition

to its wings. We will not account for that in this paper because we believe that the number

of parameters arbitrarily introduced will grow too high for any phenomenological model

to be viable. We will furthermore show that this reﬁnement is not needed to explain the

experimental measures. Consequently, undertaking this reﬁnement would imply to reject

the phenomenological approach and its computational simplicity and to solve directly the

classical laws of diﬀusion.

If we call Cs the constant threshold energy due to dissolved O2 during the preparation

process and taking into account the diﬀusion diﬀusion process modeled through expression

3 and 4, the threshold energy can be spatially modeled as follows:

Es = Cs + Csmax exp

+ Csmax2 exp

(5)

z − d
Ddif f !

 

r − d2
Ddif f 2 !

 

where Csmax and Csmax2 are taken to have the dimensions of an energy density (or ﬂuence).

E. Sample results and model validation

With this phenomenological model of the photopolymerization process, it it is possible to

simulate the time-resolved growth of the polymer micro-tip. Figure 7 shows the computed

growth of a polymer tip from the fundamental mode of a standard monomomode telecom

13

ﬁber excited at 543.5µm , to be compared to ﬁgure 2 which exhibits the experimental shape

obtained. The beam proﬁle shown on ﬁgure 7 does not seem to exhibit self-focusing as was

discussed earlier — save for the last picture corresponding to a 5s exposure time. This is

simply due to the diﬀraction length of the beam emerging from the ﬁber, which largely

surpasses the droplet thickness — 117 µm vs. 35µm .

Figure 8 shows the same build-up from a beam emerging from a monomode ﬁber at

543.5µm . The diﬀraction length is in this case half the droplet thickness and the beam can

easily be seen self-focusing, even exhibiting an oscillating behavior as predicted earlier[13].

IV. GROWTH CONDITIONS DESIGN

A. Solution manufacturing and growth atmosphere control

Figures 9 to 11 alongside tables I to III show the simulations results for varying Cs, Csmax

and Ddif f for a given solution and exposure time at a constant optical power. These ﬁgures

allow to evidence the inﬂuences of these model parameters. One can read them easily once

knowing that Cs increases in the horizontal direction and Csmax in the vertical one.

The atmosphere in which the photosensitive solution is prepared associated to its sol-

ubility in the solution plays a crucial role in the concentration of the oxygen dissolved

homogeneously within the solution, the model parameter accounting for this phenomenon

being Cs. The analysis of the ﬁgures allows to show that an increase in the dissolved oxygen

concentration leads to a decrease of the size of the tip. More precisely, it is the diameter of

the polymer tip at the point where it is attached to the ﬁber which is mostly aﬀected. We

14

can then infer that Cs will play a role in the size of the modes excited in the tip.

Furthermore, the inﬂuence of the oxygen diﬀusing from the atmosphere can also be re-

trieved from these ﬁgures. An increase of Csmax is shown to imply a decrease in the radius of

curvature of the polymer tip end and thus a drastic change on the optical function provided

by the tip. Let us point out here that we evidenced that it is the growth atmosphere oxygen

concentration which designs here the polymer tip optical function.

B. Solution viscosity and oxygen diﬀusion

However, once again, the oxygen diﬀusion from the growth atmosphere towards the so-

lution not only depends on the oxygen partial pressure of the atmosphere and the oxygen

solubility but also on the solution itself and its ability to let the oxygen diﬀuse. Our model

accounts for this phenomenon through the oxygen diﬀusion lengths Ddif f and Ddif f 2. A

careful analysis of ﬁgures 9 to 11 and the corresponding tables allows to evidence that an

increase of the oxygen diﬀusion length leads to a decrease in the radius of curvature of the

tip end.

Indeed, a rapid glance at the ﬁgures would make the reader think exactly the opposite

but attention has to be put on the values of Cs and Csmax for each simulation. These

varying concentrations of oxygen are simply due to the fact that, experimentally, the oxygen

diﬀusing from the atmosphere does diﬀuse only in a thickness of a few microns and thus

does not inﬂuence the photopolymerization process near to the ﬁber end. This leads to

the following relationship which has to be veriﬁed for our model to be physically realistic:

15

Cs ≫ Csmax exp

. Furthermore, the homogeneously dissolved oxygen does not play

−d
Ddif f

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

any role at all near the interface with the oxygen rich growth atmosphere, which implies

Csmax ≫ Cs, thus leading to an overall relation which has to be veriﬁed for all our simulations

:

Cs ≪ Csmax ≪ Cs exp

d
Ddif f !

 

(6)

A variation of Ddif f thus implies a correlated variation of Cs and Csmax. This, of course,

does not imply physically that the oxygen diﬀusion length in the solution has an inﬂuence

on the oxygen concentration in the atmosphere but rather that only a small range of varying

Ddif f can physically correspond to a given oxygen concentration. Therefore, equation 6 gives

us useful hints on which numerical values to use for our model parameters in order for it to

describe correctly the experiments.

The process of diﬀusion of O2 within the solution from dark regions to the bright ones

which are O2 depleted is taken in account by the couple of parameters Csmax2 and Ddif f 2.

Their inﬂuence on the tip shape can be inferred and is conﬁrmed by ﬁgure12. Raising either

Csmax2 or Ddif f 2 leads to a global narrowing of the tip by raising the threshold energy on

its sides.

C. Curvature radius prediction and model validation

The model that is proposed in the previous sections is based on experimental data as

far as both polymerization as a function of accumulated energy and the photo-bleaching of

16

the dye are concerned. The four simulation parameters accounting for O2 diﬀusion into and

within the formulation are on the contrary to be determined by iterative simulation and

systematic comparison to experimental data.

It is therefore a systematic experimental measurement campaign that has to be under-

taken if one wishes to set the quantitative values for the model parameters. The experimental

ﬁt has then to be realized on a value that is both signiﬁcant and quantitatively within reach

both experimentally and through simulation. In this view we have chosen to measure in

both cases the radius of curvature of the tip end. It is indeed the tip end which will largely

govern the optical function achieved.

In our case, the theoretical ﬁt could not be automated because of the large amount of

computing time it would have required: on the contrary, we have manually derived a set

of parameters that allows a correct ﬁt between theory and experiment, as can be judged

by two signiﬁcant experimental series which are reported on ﬁgures 13 and 14. The former

reports the tip end curvature radius as a function of the exposure time whereas the latter

does as a function of the beam power that is injected in the ﬁber.

Indeed, on the same ﬁgures are shown the simulation results obtained from the model

parameters given in the caption. As can be expected, threshold energy variation due to the

diﬀusion of the oxygen from the growth atmosphere —uncontrolled in the experiment— is

much larger than that which is due to the diﬀusion of oxygen within the droplet. Further-

more, the diﬀusion length found for both this phenomenon are equal. This again is expected

since diﬀusion occurs in the same medium for both phenomenon. Moreover, the diﬀusion

length found is around 0.1 µm . This value is coherent with previous results. Indeed, dif-

17

fusion coeﬃcients of dye molecules in a polymer host were measured via the holographic

grating relaxation techniques[29, 30]. A holographic grating was induced by crossing two

equal intensity coherent beams issued from a pulsed laser in order to make the measurement

of the slow translational diﬀusion coeﬃcient feasible. After excitation, the dye concentration

was gradually smeared out by diﬀusion. The corresponding optical grating relaxed with a

time τ = Λ2

4π2D characteristic of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D, Λ being the fringe spacing. Taking

10−7cm2/s for the oxygen diﬀusion coeﬃcient (by use of the Wilke-Chang correlation [31])

and Λ = 10µm (i.e. the lateral dimension of the irradiated zone corresponding to a cylin-

drical symmetry), a diﬀusion time of 0.03 s is obtained, corresponding to a value lower than

the exposure duration (a few seconds). Then, diﬀusion of oxygen from the non-irradiated

part of the droplet towards the bright area where the monomer is converted into polymer

is reasonable. A diﬀusion length of 0.1 µm is here self-consistent due to the reaction of

oxygen with all the diﬀerent active species present in the living polymer. The probability of

reaction with an initiating radical, a living monomer radical or a monomer radical trapped

in the crosslinked network is suﬃciently high to obtain ﬁnally a diﬀusion length around 0.1

µm during the growth of a polymer micro-tip.

In this view, we believe that the quantitative model issued from this experimental ﬁt is

then able to predict the polymer tip shape for this photosensitive solution and for various

experimental conditions.

Therefore, this quantitative model can now be used to explain and interpret experimental

data. For instance, both ﬁgures 13 and 14 show a change of behavior after an input ﬂuence

of 10µJ, the former showing a leap in the curve slope, the latter showing a large break in

18

the curve. The reasons for these behaviors is yet unclear but our simulations allow to show

clearly that these behavior changes are related to the tip length. Indeed, the change occurs

in both cases when the tip end reaches within an oxygen diﬀusion length from the droplet

end: prior to the break, no inﬂuence from the growth atmosphere can be seen whereas after

the break, it is atmospheric oxygen which rules the tip end shape.

V. CONCLUSION

The phenomenological model proposed in this paper is based on both experimental mea-

surements and adaptive ﬁt of the four parameters accounting for oxygen diﬀusion. The

set of quantitative experimental measurements presented here allows to get the value for

the model parameters for the photosensitive solution we used. Of course, using a diﬀerent

solution would imply another determination of the model parameters. However, once the

parameters are set, our model allows to predict the polymer tip shape for various incident

beam powers and exposure times. Once this base set, future work sould allow to estab-

lish a direct link between our phenomenological parameters and the physical and chemical

parameters characterizing the photopolymerization.

We have not, at this point yet, predicted the optical function of the polymer tip. However,

we can assume that the polymer tip, once cleansed with ethanol, shows an homogeneous

refraction index equal to that of the polymer at its maximum of polymerization. Indeed,

the cleansing will remove the polymer which has a refraction index lower than the polymer

index np = 1.51. The ambient light will then allow to reduce the slight index variations

which may be left in the tip by simply allowing the completion of polymerization.

19

In conclusion, our model allows the prediction oﬀ the shape of an optical object which

shows an homogeneous refraction index in which electromagnetic waves propagate linearly.

We can thus expect to ﬁnd some of the shelf software able to do the simulation. Figure

15 shows the results obtained for a simpliﬁed tip by the software FIMMPROP-3D from the

society Photon Design which we thank by the way for the ﬁgure.

The combination of our model and FIMMPROP-3D thus provides the tool to predict

the tip optical function and thus allows the micro-optical manufacturer to grow end-of-ﬁber

polymer micro-components at ultra low cost.

List of ﬁgure captions

1. Experimental setup: He-Ne 543.5nm laser light emerges from the ﬁber into the surface

tension driven photosensitive droplet, thus initiating the polymerization reaction.

2. Electron micrograph of a 30 µm long polymer tip grown on the end of monomode ﬁber

at 543.5nm. Its basis width is on the order of the ﬁber core: 3 microns.

3. Detail of the end of the polymer tip shown of Fig.2.

4. Polymer tip grown with a LP21 mode on the end of a standard telecommunication

ﬁber.

5. Typical polymerization curve expressed in terms of index of refraction variation as a

function of the accumulated energy Eacc, the maximum index variation between the

monomer and the polymer being dn = 0.04. The existence of a threshold energy Es

below which no polymerization can occur is evidenced.

6. Typical shape of a 30µm long polymer tip computed using standard BPM and the

accumulated energy model shown on Fig.5 without taking into account O2 diﬀusion

into the solution.

7. Simulated growth of a polymer tip on the cleaved end of monomode telecom 1.55µm

ﬁber excited in 543.5µm in its fundamental mode (bottom), alongside the beam proﬁle

during the growth (top). The beam emerges from the ﬁber on the left.

(bottom), alongside the beam proﬁle during the growth (top). The beam emerges

from the ﬁber on the left.

9. Simulated inﬂuence of dissolved oxygen (Cs) and atmosphere O2 concentration (Csmax)

for a diﬀusion length Ddif f = 1µm. From (a) to (e) Cs = 103J/m2 and Csmax rises.

From (f) to (j) Cs = 104J/m2 and Csmax rises. From (k) to (o) Cs = 105J/m2 and

Csmax rises. Precise values are given in Table I. The ﬁber-end to which is attached

the tip is located on the left-hand side. The hollow ends of tips that can be seen on

ﬁgures 9 through 11 are a rendering artifact and mean that the tips are actually ﬂat.

10. Simulated inﬂuence of dissolved oxygen (Cs) and atmosphere O2 concentration (Csmax)

for a diﬀusion length Ddif f = 2µm. From (a) to (e) Cs = 103J/m2 and Csmax rises.

From (f) to (j) Cs = 104J/m2 and Csmax rises. From (k) to (o) Cs = 105J/m2 and

Csmax rises. Precise values are given in Table II. The ﬁber-end to which is attached

the tip is located on the left-hand side.

11. Simulated inﬂuence of dissolved oxygen (Cs) and atmosphere O2 concentration (Csmax)

for a diﬀusion length Ddif f = 3µm. From (a) to (e) Cs = 103J/m2 and Csmax rises.

From (f) to (j) Cs = 104J/m2 and Csmax rises. From (k) to (o) Cs = 105J/m2 and

Csmax rises. Precise values are given in Table III. The ﬁber-end to which is attached

the tip is located on the left-hand side.

12. Left: simulated polymer tip without taking into account diﬀusion within the droplet.

Right: droplet inner diﬀusion taken in account. Simulation data: Cs=5×102J/m2,

Csmax=108J/m2, Ddif f 2 =Ddif f =0.1µm, Csmax2=104J/m2 and an exposure time of

28

1s. The dotted line around the right-hand tip is a shadow of the left-hand one meant

to ease comparison.

13. Experimentally measured curvature radii are compared to simulated ones for varying

exposure times and for a beam power of 2,5µW, an experimental eosin concentra-

tion of 3% and the following simulation data: Cs= 5×102J/m2 ,Csmax =108J/m2,

Ddif f =Ddif f 2= 0,1µm, Csmax2=104J/m2 and α = 10.

14. Experimentally measured curvature radii are compared to simulated ones for varying

output beam powers and for an exposure time of 1s, an experimental eosin concen-

tration of 3% and the following simulation data: Cs= 5×102J/m2 ,Csmax =108J/m2,

Ddif f =Ddif f 2= 0,1µm, Csmax2=104J/m2 and α = 10. The straight lines are a mere

guide to the eyes.

15. Simulated propagation of light in a sample polymer tip: the initially plane wave un-

dergoes strong focusing prior to reaching the tip end, thus providing high enlargement

of the numerical aperture of the system.

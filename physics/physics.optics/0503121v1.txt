A left-handed (LH) material, which exhibits a negative refraction index due to simulta-

neously negative permeability and permittivity, was ﬁrst introduced by Veselago in 1967 [1].

Negative refraction has recently attracted much attention due to its potential impacts and
applications (see e.g. [2, 3, 4]). A slab of LH material with ǫ = −1 and µ = −1 can act as a

superlens (with subwavelength focusing) [3, 5]. Subwavelength focusing can also be achieved

with a slab of a special photonic crystal (PC) [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Negative refraction may occur

in two distinct types of PCs [11]: (i) PCs having negative eﬀective refractive index nef f

near the center of the Brillouin-zone [6, 12, 13, 14]. For this type, the dot product of the

Poynting vector and the wave vector is negative (like in an LH material), and consequently

it may possess some behaviors similar to those of an LH material (e.g.

focusing slab-lens

satisfying Snell’s law [3]). (ii) PCs with convex equal frequency contours (EFCs) at a corner

of the Brillouin-zone [15, 16, 17]. For this type, the dot product of Poynting vector and the

wave vector is positive, and nef f can not be deduced. Consequently, its behavior won’t be

so similar to that of an LH material.

Open cavity [6], which relies on the concept of negative refractive index, is another

amazing property of an LH material. The open cavity suggested by Notomi [6] consists

of four alternating rectanglar blocks of two materials with oppositive refractive indices. A

simple ray-trace analysis can show that there exist many closed ray paths (with zero value

of optical path) running across the four interfaces and thus a kind of an open cavity (with no

surrounding reﬂective wall) is formed. The idea of open cavity is based on the cancellation

of the optical path (deﬁned as the integration of the refractive index over the ray path)

and is straightforward. Since a homogeneous LH material at an optical wavelength has

not been experimentally realized yet and a photonic crystal of negative refraction in the

optical regime is comparatively much easier to fabricate, it would be very interesting and

desirable to realize (at least by numerical simulation) an open cavity with a photonic crystal

of negative refraction of LH behavior (type (i)). However, this has not be achieved though

Notomi introduced the idea of open cavity more than 4 years ago [6]. In the present Letter

we report an open cavity realized with a photonic crystal of negative refraction.

In the design of our open cavity, we use the same 2D photonic crystal of negative refraction

as considered by Notomi [6], i.e., a triangular lattice of air holes (of radius 0.4a; a is the

lattice constant) in GaAs background (with n = 3.6). For E-polarization (with the electric

ﬁeld along the z-direction), the equal-frequency surface is almost circular (indicating that

the PC can be considered as an isotropic medium and nef f can be well deﬁned at these

frequencies) at the second band in a frequency window ranging from 0.29(c/a) to 0.34(c/a).

Furthermore, EFS for a higher frequency has a shorter radius. This indicates that the

Poynting vector (group velocity) is in the opposite direction of the wave vector and thus
In particular, nef f is nearly −1 at frequency

the negative refraction is of LH behavior.

f = 0.30(c/a).

It was shown in our previous work [18] that the direction of surface termination is critical

for a high transmission (i.e., coupling) at an interface between air (n = 1) and a photonic
crystal with eﬀective refractive index nef f = −1.

In particular, when wave vector k is

along the direction Γ-M or Γ-K, the modes have asymmetry of C1h, which gives two distinct

cases: the bulk mode has an even symmetry when k is along the Γ-M direction, and an

odd symmetry when k is along the Γ-K direction. Since the external plane wave at normal

incidence is of even symmetry, only the Bloch waves with an even symmetry can be excited.

Consequently this results in small transmission (i.e., large reﬂection) for any incident angle

at an interface normal to the Γ-K direction and the reﬂection is small for virtually all incident

angles when the interface is normal to the Γ-M direction. Therefore, the open cavity sketched

FIG. 2: The resonant frequency (squares connected with dashed lines) and the quality factor (stars

connected with solid lines) when the distance d between the origin O and the tip of an air wedge

increases. Each PC wedge has 13 rows of air holes. The inset shows the equal frequency surface for

the PC of negative refraction around the resonant frequency (the numbers mark the frequencies in

unit of (c/a)).

by Notomi won’t work due to the large reﬂection loss at air-PC interfaces (if one tries to

reduce the reﬂection at one air-PC interface of a rectangular block by aligning the normal

of this interface with the Γ-M direction, the reﬂection would be large at the other air-PC

interface of the rectangular block).

Figure 1 shows the novel design of our open cavity based on the same photonic crystal of

negative refraction. It consists of three 60-degree wedges of PC of negative refraction with

three 60-degree in-between wedges of air. The whole structure is designed in such a way

that all the air-PC interfaces are normal to the Γ-M direction (to reduce the reﬂection at

the air-PC interfaces). The simple ray-trace sketch for a close optical path in the inset of

Fig. 1 shows how such an open cavity may work (if the reﬂection at the interfaces is small).

Besides the direction of the surface termination, the position of the surface termination

also has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the refraction at an air-PC interface [19]. In our design,

the position of the surface termination can be determined by the location of the tip points

frequency f = 0.309657(c/a). Each PC wedge contains 13 rows of air holes. The distance between

D1, D2 and D3 (see Fig. 1). Due to the symmetry, the coordinates of these tip points can

be determined uniquely by a single parameter d (the distance between the center O and any
of the tip points), i.e. Di = d(cos(i2π/3 − π/2), sin(i2π/3 − π/2)), i = 1, 2, 3. In Fig. 1, the

dashed lines indicate the position of surface termination for another value of d (i.e., when

the air wedges move a bit outward).

Finite diﬀerence time domain (FDTD) method [20] is used here to calculate the reso-

nant mode and analyze the resonant property of the present open cavity. The fast Fourier

transform (FFT)/Pad´e approximation [21] is also applied to compute eﬃciently the resonant

frequency f0 and the quality factor Q = f0/∆f , where ∆f is the full width half maximum

5

(FWHM) of the spectral response of the cavity [21]. We ﬁrst study how the position of the

surface termination inﬂuences the quality factor of an open cavity with 13 rows of air holes in

each PC wedge. Figure 2 shows how the resonant frequency (squares connected with dashed

lines) and the quality factor (stars connected with solid lines) of the open cavity vary with

the distance d between the origin O and the tip of an air wedge. d = 0.9a corresponds to

a tangential cut of the boundary air holes (i.e., they just remain whole). When d increases

from 0 to 0.9a, the resonant frequency varies in a range of [0.308(c/a), 0.313(c/a)], in which

EFS is quite circular (see Fig. 2). This also indicates that the resonance can occur only in

a frequency range where an eﬀective negative reﬂection index can be deduced and is close
to −1.

From Fig. 2 (for the case when each wedge has 13 rows of air holes) one sees that the

quality factor reaches a peak value of about 2209 at d = 0.49a. The spectral response of

the open cavity is plotted in Fig. 3(a) (calculated with FDTD by illuminating the cavity

with a pulse and monitoring the evolution of the ﬁeld; the FFT/Pad´e method is applied to

determine the resonant frequency). From this ﬁgure one sees that the resonant frequency f0
is 0.309725(c/a) and the FWHM of the spectral response is ∆f = 1.4 ∗ 10−4(c/a). Thus, the
corresponding quality factor is Q ≡ f0/∆f ≈ 2209. Once the resonant frequency is known,

we can determine the corresponding modal ﬁeld by simulating a second propagation and

extracting the ﬁeld pattern at that frequency. Fig. 3(b) shows the corresponding resonant

modal ﬁeld. The present cavity has a symmetry of point group C3v. From Fig. 3(b) one

can see that the irreducible representation of the localized modes in the open cavity is A1

for point group C3v [22]. The modal ﬁeld is localized both in the photonic crystal and air.

The modal ﬁeld distribution has a maximal amplitude in air. From Fig. 3(b) one can also

see obvious negative refraction at each PC/air interface.

The resonant frequency varies little (within 2 ∗ 10−4(c/a)) as Nrow increases. This is

understandable since the modal ﬁeld of the open cavity is localized near the center and

consequently the resonant frequency of the open cavity is determined mainly by the distri-

bution of the eﬀective refractive index along a closed optical path near the center. One can

easily see that the modal ﬁeld distribution in Fig. 3(c) (with 17 rows of air holes in each PC

wedge) is indeed similar to that in Fig. 3(b) (with 13 rows of air holes in each PC wedge).

The quality factor increases a bit from 2209 to 2540.

In summary, we have studied a novel open cavity formed by a photonic crystal with

6

negative eﬀective refraction index. Due to the negative refraction (and the high transmission)

at the PC/air interfaces, the propagating wave in the air wedges is connected to that in the

PC wedges and thus form a closed path (with zero optical path due to the negative value

of the eﬀective refractive index of the PC) for resonance. The quality factor of the open

cavity can be higher than 2000. The inﬂuence of the interface termination on the resonant

frequency and the quality factor has been addressed. The present design idea for an open

cavity can be generalized to other PCs of negative refraction (of type (i)).

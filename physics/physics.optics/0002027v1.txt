The nonlinear pulse propagation in an optical ﬁbers with varying parameters is investigated. The
capture of moving in the frequency domain femtosecond colored soliton by a dispersive trap formed in
an amplifying ﬁber makes it possible to accumulate an additional energy and to reduce signiﬁcantly
the soliton pulse duration. Nonlinear dynamics of the chirped soliton pulses in the dispersion
managed systems is also investigated. The methodology developed does provide a systematic way
to generate inﬁnite “ocean” of the chirped soliton solutions of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation
(NSE) with varying coeﬃcients.

I. INTRODUCTION

In 1973 Hasegawa and Tappert [1] showed theoretically that an optical pulse in a dielectric ﬁbers forms an envelope
solitons, and in 1980 Mollenauer, Stolen and Gordon [2] demonstrated the eﬀect experimentally. This discovery
is signiﬁcant in its application to optical communications. Today the optical soliton is regarded as an important
alternative for the next generation of high speed telecommunication systems.

The theory of NSE solitons was developed for the ﬁrst time in 1971 by Zakharov and Shabad [3]. The concept of the
soliton involves a large number of interesting problems in applied mathematics since it is an exact analytical solution
of a nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations. The theory of optical solitons described by the nonlinear Schr¨odinger
equation has produced perfect agreement between theory and experiment [4].

In this paper we present mathematical description of solitary waves propagation in a nonlinear dispersive medium

with varying parameters.

The soliton spectral tunneling eﬀect was theoretically predicted in [5]. This is characterized in the spectral domain
by the passage of a femtosecond soliton through a potential barrier-like spectral inhomogeneity of the group velocity
dispersion (GVD), including the forbidden band of a positive GVD. It is interesting to draw an analogy with quantum
mechanics where the solitons are considered to exhibit particle-like behavior. The soliton spectral tunneling eﬀect
also can be considered as an example of the dynamic dispersion soliton management technique.
In the ﬁrst part
of the paper we will concentrate on the problem of femtosecond solitons ampliﬁcation. We will show that spectral
inhomogeneity of GVD allows one to capture a soliton in a sort of spectral trap and to accumulate an additional
energy during the process of the soliton ampliﬁcation. In the second part we will consider the problem of the short
soliton pulse propagation in the nonlinear ﬁber with static non-uniform inhomogeneity of GVD. The methodology
developed does provide a systematic way to generate inﬁnite “ocean” of the chirped soliton solutions of NSE model
with varying coeﬃcients.

II. FEMTOSECOND SOLITON AMPLIFICATION

It is well known that due to the Raman self-scattering eﬀect [6] (called soliton self-frequency shift [7]) the central
femtosecond soliton frequency shifts to the red spectral region and so-called colored solitons are generated. This eﬀect
decreases signiﬁcantly the eﬃciency of resonant ampliﬁcation of femtosecond solitons. The mathematical model we
consider based on the modiﬁed NSE including the eﬀects of molecular vibrations and soliton ampliﬁcation processes
(see details in [8]):

As numerical experiments showed the GVD inhomogeneity as a potential well allows one to capture a soliton in a
sort of spectral trap. Figure 1 shows the nonlinear dynamics of the soliton spectral trapping eﬀect in the spectral
domain. As soliton approaches the well, it does not slow down but speeds up, and then, after it has got into the well,
the soliton is trapped. There exists a long time of soliton trapping in internal region of the well .This eﬀect opens
a controlled possibility to increase the energy of a soliton. As follows from our computer simulations the capture of
moving in the frequency space femtosecond colored soliton by a dispersive trap formed in an amplifying optical ﬁber
makes it possible to accumulate an additional energy in the soliton dispersive trap and to reduce signiﬁcantly the
soliton pulse duration.

III. DISPERSION MANAGEMENT: CHIRPED SOLITONS

Let us consider the propagation of a nonlinear pulse in the anomalous (or normal) group velocity dispersion ﬁber
of length Z1. The complex amplitude q of the light wave in a ﬁber with variable parameters D2(Z) , N2(Z) and Γ(Z)
is described by the nonlinear Schrodinger equation

Theorem 1. Consider the NSE (3) with varying dispersion, nonlinearity and gain. Suppose that Wronskian
W[N2,D2] of the functions N2(Z) and D2(Z) is nonvanishing, thus two functions N2(Z) and D2(Z) are linearly inde-
pendent. There are then inﬁnite number of solutions of Eq. (3) in the form of Eq.4

The derivative in (13) is functional derivative. For the ﬁrst time this equation was solved numerically by Kumar and
Hasegawa in [9] and gave rise a new concept of quasi-solitons [10,11]. Now we make the important assumption about
the solution of Eq. (9).

Let us consider the complete nonlinear regime when Eq. (9) represents the ideal NLS equation, i.e. we will allow

Ω(Z) ≡ 0 , then from (12) follows that

one can obtain the soliton solution of Eq. 3 in the form of the chirped solitons Eqs. 4-5 and Eqs. 6-7.. Consequently,

and new chirped soliton solutions generation.

Lemma 1: Soliton GVD management. Consider the NSE (3) with constant nonlinear coeﬃcient N2 = const and

Lemma 5: Combined dispersion and nonlinear soliton management. Consider the NSE (3) with varying nonlinear
coeﬃcient N2(Z) and with varying along Z-coordinate the dispersion and gain coeﬃcients too. Suppose that Wronskian
W[N2,D2] is vanishing, or that the functions N2(Z) and D2(Z) are linearly dependent. Suppose also that the function
D2(Z) is determined by the initial control function D2(Z)=Ξ(Z),where the function Ξ(Z) is required only to be once

The analytical solutions for the diﬀerent regimes of the main soliton parameters management (intensity, pulse duration,
ampliﬁcation or absorption ) in the case of W[N2,D2]=0 can be obtained by using theorem 2.

Let us consider some examples. The case of Γ(Z) ≡ 0 and N2(Z)=N2(0) corresponds to the problem of ideal GVD

soliton management. The soliton solution in this case is:

q(Z, T ) = −ηN −1/2

Here T and Z are ordinary variables and C is arbitrary constant. If we use the expressions D2(Z)=constant and
N2=N2(0) then we obtain the following solutions of Eq. (3) in the form of hyperbolically growing ideal bright and
dark solitons (for the ﬁrst time reported in [12,13]

Let us consider the soliton intensity management problem. Chirped soliton pulse of Eq. 3 with the constant

intensity can be obtained by using Lemma 2

P (Z) = −CZ − 1; D2(Z) = C/(1 + CZ)2; Γ(Z) = −C/2/(1 + CZ)

(38)

Let us consider some periodical chirped soliton solutions of Eq. 3. Suppose that the soliton intensity varies periodically
as

Then soliton solution in the case of n=2 is determined by Eq. 4 with parameters:

D2(Z)P 2(Z) = Θ(Z) = 1 + δ sin2n Z

The main soliton features of the solutions given by theorem 1 and theorem 2 were investigated by using direct
computer simulations. We have investigated the interaction dynamics of particle-like solutions obtained, their soliton-
like character was calculated with the accuracy as high as 10−9. We also have investigated the inﬂuence of high-order
eﬀects on the dynamics of dispersion and ampliﬁcation management. As follows from numerical investigations elastic
character of chirped solitons interacting does not depend on a number of interacting solitons and their phases. Figure 2
shows the computer simulation dynamics of three hyperbolically growing solitons Eq. 29. NSE solution with periodic
dispersion coeﬃcient is shown in Figure 3. Here the dispersion management function is

D2(Z) = 1 + δ sin2(Z)

(45)

and the soliton solution is given by Eqs. 17-18. In Figure 3 parameters C=200 and δ = −0.9. Figure 4 represents the
two dispersion managed solitons interaction in the case of equal phases and in Figure 5 the interaction dynamics of
two solitons is shown in the case of opposite phases. Figure 6 shows the intensity managed solitons dynamics of the
form presented by Eq. 38. Figures 7-9 show the nonlinear propagation and interaction of the dispersion and nonlinear
managed solitons of Eqs. 42-43. The main parameters in computer simulations were C=200; δ = ±0.9. Figure 10
illustrates the dynamics of the ﬁssion of the bound states of two hyperbolically growing solitons Eqs. 29-30 produced
by self-induced Raman scattering eﬀect given by Eqs.2-3. This remarkable fact also emphasize the full soliton features
of solutions discussed. They not only interact elastically but they can form the bound states and these bound states
split under perturbations. The possibility to ﬁnd the plethora of soliton solutions in the case of strong dispersion
management is reported in the recent paper of Zakharov and Manakov [14].

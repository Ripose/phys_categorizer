Negative refraction by quantum vacuum

Abstract

The phase velocity of light is co–parallel to the direction of energy ﬂow in classical vacuum.

However, in certain uncommon materials, these two vectors can be oppositely directed, in

which case the phase velocity is termed ‘negative’. This negative phase velocity (NPV) gives

rise to many exotic phenomenons, such as negative refraction, inverse Doppler shift and inverse

˘Cerenkov radiation, and has technological allure. According to quantum electrodynamics, the

presence of a magnetostatic ﬁeld makes vacuum an anisotropic medium for the passage of light.

Under the inﬂuence of a suﬃciently strong magnetostatic ﬁeld, vacuum supports NPV. Such

ultrastrong magnetic ﬁelds are believed to arise due to dynamo action in newborn neutron

stars and in binary neutron star mergers, for examples. In view of the possible occurrence of

negative refraction, the inﬂuence of ultrastrong magnetostatic ﬁelds must be carefully taken

into account in astronomical observations relating to neutron stars and associated gamma–ray

bursts.

In the usual descriptions of light propagation, as learned by generations of students from stan-

dard textbooks on optics [8] and electromagnetics [9], the phase velocity casts a positive projection

onto the direction of energy ﬂow, as provided by the time–averaged Poynting vector. That is, the

phase velocity is positive. However, in certain special circumstances, it is possible for the phase ve-

locity to cast a negative projection onto the time–averaged Poynting vector; i.e., the phase velocity

can be negative.

The transition from positive phase velocity (PPV) to negative phase velocity (NPV) is of partic-

ular interest because NPV underpins the much–heralded phenomenon of negative refraction [1, 2],

as well as many other exotic phenomenons such as inverse Doppler shift and inverse ˘Cerenkov radi-

ation [3]. The scientiﬁc and technological possibilities oﬀered by negative refraction — such as the

construction of near–perfect lenses from planar slabs of NPV–supporting materials — have been

widely reported on [2, 10]. Much of the research eﬀort has been directed towards the realization

of metamaterials which can be used to achieve negative refraction. These metamaterials are artiﬁ-

cial composite materials, often having complex micromorphologies [1, 11, 12]. Metamaterials with

simple micromorphologies can also support NPV, as is demonstrated by certain homogenized com-

posite materials [13]. A signiﬁcant milestone was reached recently by experimentalists through the

fabrication of metamaterials which support negative refraction at the optical wavelengths [11, 12].

We report here on the manifestation of NPV in a quite diﬀerent context, namely in vacuum
ˆBs. In classical vacuum, the phase velocity

under the inﬂuence of a magnetostatic ﬁeld Bs =

Bs|
|

is positive and the passage of light is unaﬀected by Bs, as reported by an inertial observer. How-

ever, this is not the case for the quantum electrodynamical (QED) vacuum. The QED vacuum is a

nonlinear medium which can be linearized for rapidly time–varying plane waves. Thereby, for prop-

agation of light, QED vacuum is represented by the anisotropic dielectric–magnetic constitutive

relations [4]

The constitutive dyadics (2) were derived by Adler [4] from the Heisenberg–Euler eﬀective La-

grangrian of the electromagnetic ﬁeld [14, 15].

Suppose that plane waves with ﬁeld phasors

H(r) = H 0 exp (ik • r)

ˆk propagate through the QED vacuum described by (1) and (2). For
and wavevector k =
simplicity, let ˆBs and ˆk both be aligned with the Cartesian z axis. In this case there is only one

wavenumber, namely

= ω√ǫ0µ0 (unlike the ˆBs 6

each propagation direction, as is described in the Supplementary Information section). The

time–averaged Poynting vector P and phase velocity vp are straightforwardly derived by combining

(1), (2) and (3) with the Maxwell curl postulates [16]. Thus, the projection of the phase velocity

onto the time–averaged Poynting vector emerges as

Clearly, the phase velocity is positive for

< 1/√8a but negative for

> 1/√8a. In fact,

the same inequalities for PPV and NPV hold when the direction of planewave propagation is

perpendicular to the direction of the magnetostatic ﬁeld, as is described in the Supplementary

(4)

Information section.

Magnetic ﬁelds of magnitude greater than 1/√8a = 1.374

1012 Tesla are needed for QED

×

vacuum to support NPV propagation. To ﬁnd ﬁelds of this magnitude we turn to astrophysi-

cal environments. Ultrastrong magnetic ﬁelds, developed by dynamo action, are associated with
certain neutron stars. For example, ﬁelds of the order of 1010–1012 Tesla, have been estimated

for newborn neutron stars, such as soft gamma repeaters [5, 6]. Considerably stronger ﬁelds, of
the order of 1011–1014 Tesla, are predicted to arise during the merger of a binary neutron star

system [7]. Accordingly, NPV propagation may be expected to occur in these neutron–star en-

vironments. Across boundaries between two regions, one of which experiences a magnetostatic
1012 Tesla and the other a magnetostatic ﬁeld of magnitude

ﬁeld of magnitude 1/√8a < 1.374

1/√8a > 1.374

1012 Tesla, negative refraction of light will occur.

Our results have far–reaching implications for observational astronomy and theoretical astro-

physics. The possibility of negative refraction arising from ultrastrong magnetic ﬁelds should be

taken into consideration in estimating astronomical positions, particularly if the light path from

3

the detector to the point of observation traverses regions in the vicinity of neutron stars, for ex-

ample. Furthermore, negative refraction may well inﬂuence the propagation of gamma–ray bursts

and other electromagnetic radiation emitted by neutron stars.

strong magnetostatic ﬁeld is acting. Here we provide further details of the planewave analysis.

As in our Letter, suppose that plane waves with ﬁeld phasors (3) propagate through the QED

For our purpose, it suﬃces to consider only two cases: (i) propagation parallel to ˆBs and (ii)

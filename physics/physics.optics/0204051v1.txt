Abstract: Presented is an analysis of general scaling perturbations in a transmitting ﬁber. For
elliptical perturbations, under some conditions an intermode dispersion parameter characterizing
modal PMD is shown to be directly proportional to the mode dispersion.

In the following paper we derive a generalized Hermitian Hamiltonian approach for the treatment of Maxwell
equations in waveguides as well as develop a perturbation theory for the general class of scaling perturbations
that include ellipticity and a uniform scaling of an arbitrary index proﬁle. Because of the Hermitian nature
of the formulation most of the results from the well developed perturbation theory of quantum mechanical
systems can be directly related to the light propagation in the waveguides. Such formulation provides for
an intuitive way of understanding PMD and birefringence in the elliptically perturbed ﬁber proﬁles. Region
of validity of our theory extends to the case of large variations of the dielectric constant across the ﬁber
crossection and is limited only by an amount of re-scaling. Finally, we establish that if in some range
of frequencies a particular mode behaves like a mode of pure polarization T E,T M (where polarization is
judged by the relative amounts of the electric and magnetic longitudinal energies in a modal crossection) its
inter-mode dispersion parameter τ = | ∂△βe
∂ω | is related to its dispersion D as τ = λδ|D|, where δ is a measure
of the ﬁber ellipticity and △βe is a split in a wavevector of a linearly polarized doubly degenerate mode of
interest due to an elliptical perturbation.

While there has been a wide amount of work done on estimating such quantities as local birefringence
induced by perturbations in the ﬁber proﬁle most of the treatments were geared toward understanding the
low contrast, weakly guiding systems such as ubiquitous silica waveguides and are not directly applicable
to the high contrast systems such as Bragg ﬁbers, photonic crystal ﬁbers and integrated optics waveguides
which are steadily emerging as an integral part of the state of the art transmission systems.

In deriving Hamiltonian formulation for the eigen ﬁelds of a generic waveguide exhibiting translational
symmetry in longitudinal ˆz direction we start with a well known set of Maxwell equations written in terms
of transverse and longitudinal ﬁelds [1]. Assuming the form of the ﬁeld

Ft = (ˆz × F) × ˆz Maxwell equations can be rewritten as a generalized Hermitian eigen problem [2]

In this form operators on the left and on the right are Hermitian thus deﬁning a generalized Hermitian eigen
problem and allowing for all the convenient properties pertaining to such a form, including real eigenvalues

Deﬁning hermitian operator on the left of (2) as ˆB and the one on the right ˆA and introducing Dirac

In the following we analyze uniform along ˆz axis perturbations. If a perturbation such as general re-scaling
of coordinates xscaled = x(1 + δx),yscaled = y(1 + δy) is introduced into the system it will modify an operator
ˆA. A particular case of general re-scaling when δx = δy correspond to the uniform scaling of a structure,
while the case of δx = −δy corresponds to a uniform ellipticity. Denoting a correction to an original operator
on the left of (2) δ ˆA, the new eigen values ˜β of the split doubly degenerate eigen mode are found by solving
a secular equation [3] and gives

The inter-mode dispersion parameter being proportional to PMD [4] is deﬁned to be equal to the mismatch
of the inverse group velocities of the split due to the perturbation modes τ = 1

Now we derive a form of the perturbation operator for the cases of uniform scaling and uniform ellipticity.
We start with an elliptical waveguide and a generalized Hermitian formulation (2) where the derivatives in
operator ˆA should be understood as the derivatives over the coordinates xscaled and yscaled. We then transform
into the coordinate system in which an elliptical waveguide becomes cylindrical. Assuming normalization (4)
after some combersome algebra [5] we arrive at the following expressions.

Another important result about change in the propagation constant of a mode under uniform scaling is
that its frequency derivative is proportional to the dispersion of a mode. To derive this result we consider a
dispersion relation for some mode of a waveguide β = f (ω). From the form of Maxwell equations it is clear
that if we uniformly re-scale all the transverse dimensions in a system by a factor of (1 + δ) then the new
˜β = β + △βs for the same ω will satisfy ˜β = f (ω(1+δ))
. Decomposing the last expression in Taylor series and
collecting terms of the same order in δ we derive expressions for △βs and its derivative △βs = δ(ω ∂β
∂ω − β),
∂ω = δω ∂2β
∂△βs
Case of uniform ellipticity δx = −δy = δ. A ﬁrst order correction to the split in the values of propagation
constants of the modes (β, 1) and (β, −1) due to the uniform re-scaling becomes (5)

∂ω2 = −λδD(ω) where D(ω) is a dispersion of the mode.

From expression (7) we ﬁnd that the split between the degenerate modes due to the ellipticity is proportional
to the diﬀerence in the longitudinal magnetic and electric energies in the crossection of a ﬁber. The rest of
the crossterms in expression (7) usually do not contribute substantially to the split, unless special structures
are considered where longitudinal magnetic and longitudinal electric energies are of the same order.

Radius of the inner core (µm)

Fig. 1. Eﬀective birefringence due to the elliptical perturbation in a double core high dielectric contrast
ﬁber. Data is presented for the fundamental linearly polarized doubly degenerate mode. While the width of
a ring was kept at a constant 1µm corresponding inner radii R was varied in the interval (3,10)µm. Split
in a wavevector of an originally degerate mode due to the uniform elliptical perturbation of magnitude δ as
predicted by the perturbation theory (circles) is compared to the results of the Finite Diﬀerence numerical
simulations (crosses). Excellent correspondence over the whole range of inner radii is observed.

An important conclusion about PMD of a structure can be drawn when electric or magnetic longitudinal
energy dominates substantially over the other (for a longer discussion see [5]). In the case of pure-like T E
(Ez ∼ 0) or T M (Hz ∼ 0) modes split due to the uniform scaling (6) becomes almost identical to the split in
the degeneracy of the modes due to the uniform ellipticity perturbation (7). Thus, in the case when the mode
is predominantly T E or T M as judged by the amounts of the corresponding longitudinal energies in the
crossection we expect △βs = △βe. As PMD is proportional to the intermode dispersion parameter τ = ∂△βe
and taking into account expressions for the frequency derivatives of △βs we arrive to the conclusion that for
such a mode PMD is proportional to the despersion of a mode

We conclude by presenting the results of calculations of the normalized birefringence due to the uniform
elliptical perturbation in the case of a double core high dielectric contrast ﬁber Fig.1. Fundamental doubly
degenerate mode of m = 1 was studied in a ring-like ﬁber of 1.0 to 1.5 index contrast. Excellent correspon-
dence between the predictions of the pertubation theory and, in principle, exact Finite Diﬀerence numerical
simulations is observed.

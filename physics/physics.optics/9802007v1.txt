Abstract

We consider an optical diﬀraction grating in which the spatial distribution
of open slits forms a fractal set. The Fraunhofer diﬀraction patterns through
the fractal grating are obtained analytically for the simplest triad Cantor
type and its generalized version. The resulting interference patterns exhibit
characteristics of the original fractals and their scaling properties.

I. INTRODUCTION

A widespread interest in fractal geometry has been generated by Mandelbrot with his
monumental work [1] that deals with the geometry of phenomena observed in many ﬁelds of
science. The fractal geometry is a fast growing subject and a cross-disciplinary ﬁeld ranging
from social science to biological science and physics [2–4].

In this article we consider another aspect of fractal geometry, namely, the Fraunhofer
diﬀraction of an optical grating whose slit distribution is fractal. In the ordinary optical
gratings the slits are evenly distributed forming a one-dimensional lattice [5]. We take,
instead, a fractal grating and study the optical interference pattern by the light wave coming
from the grating. As a simple example a Cantor set type grating is considered, and analytic
results are obtained. The resulting interference patterns show self-similar structure and the
same scaling property as those in the fractal grating itself. In other words the Fraunhofer
diﬀraction transforms the fractal geometry of the optical grating to the fractal interference
pattern.

In Sec. II the simplest triad Cantor set type grating is introduced, and the interference
amplitude is explicitly evaluated. The amplitude turns out to be a repeated product of a
function of a rescaled argument by 3m for each integer m, which respects the scaling property
of the diﬀraction grating. In Sec. III we generalize the triad Cantor set to a (2H + 1)-piece
Cantor set, and similar results are obtained but with a diﬀerent scale factor 2H + 1. In Sec.
IV we discuss further generalizations of the model. The ordinary diﬀraction grating has been

1

an important tool in optical spectroscopy. Although we have not yet proposed any practical
application, this kind of fractal diﬀraction grating may be useful for some purposes.

II. CANTOR DIFFRACTION GRATING

One of the simplest example of fractal sets is the Cantor set deﬁned on a closed interval
[0, 1]. The ﬁrst stage of construction consists of dividing the interval [0, 1] into three equal
pieces, then removing the middle open interval, designated ( 1
3). At the second stage one
divides each remaining pieces into three and again remove each middle piece. Repeating this
process inﬁnitely many times one obtains a fractal set whose fractal dimension is D = ln 2
ln 3
[1,2].

3, 2

Let us consider a diﬀraction grating whose slits are distributed as the Cantor set described
above. For convenience, we take the starting total transparent region to be [−a, a]. At the
ﬁrst stage we make the middle third (− a
3 ) opaque, in the second stage we again make the
middle pieces of each of the two remaining thirds opaque, and so on to N times. The resulting
grating consists of fractally distributed 2N -slits of width 2a
3N . Let this be called the Cantor
diﬀraction grating of N-th generation. Figure 1 illustrates such a construction for the case
of N = 3. The open slits are of equal widths but unevenly distributed. The coordinates of
the middle, beginning, and end points of the j-th slit are denoted by xj, x−
j , respectively.
The Fraunhofer interference pattern of light through a Cantor diﬀraction grating of N-th

plane, and k is the wave vector. The grating function G(x) is deﬁned as

The maximum of F (β) occurs at β = 0, FN (0) = 1, and the function oscillates very rapidly.
Figure (2a) shows FN (β) in the case 2ka = 310, N = 10 for 0 ≤ θ ≤ π
2 , while Figure (2b)
shows the same function only for the region 0 ≤ θ ≤ 0.04. Apparently they look similar,
and this self-similarity becomes more striking as N increases. The distribution of zeroes
looks random, which may imply that the distribution of the dark fringes in the interference
pattern is fractal.

III. GENERALIZATION OF CANTOR DIFFRACTION GRATING

For the purpose of generalizing the Cantor grating we ﬁrst consider a function represen-

tation of the Cantor set. Let g(x) be a periodic function of period 2a,

3

and deﬁne a grating structure function GN (x) as

GN (x) ≡ g(x)g(3x) · · · g(3N −1x) =

g(3mx),

(−a ≤ x ≤ a).

(10)

Using this grating structure function the interference pattern through the Cantor grating
can be represented as

1, −a ≤ x ≤ − a
3 ,
0, − a
3 < x < a
3 ,
−1, a
3 ≤ x ≤ a ,

which may be called a diﬀraction transformation between GN (x) and FN (β). Their similarity
in the product form of periodic functions and scaling property are obvious. To obtain the
interference pattern we simply replace the generating function g(x) by the periodic function
cos

β
3N
Let us now consider the possible generalization of the fractal structure. One immediate
(cid:16)
generalization is to take the generating function g(x) diﬀerent from the simplest Cantor case.
For example, we consider a periodic function h(x) of period 2a. As shown in the Figure
3, the region [−a, a] is divided into 2H + 1 pieces of equal length with H being a positive
integer. Its value is zero in the dark region and one in the open region, where the dark and
open regions alternate.

h(x) =

1, −a + 4ma

2H+1 < x < −a + 4(m+1)a
2H+1 ,

(

(m = 0, ±1, ±2, · · ·).

With H = 1, one ﬁnds that h(x) reduces to g(x) of the previous section. From this periodic
function we construct a grating function

GN (x) =

We note that the factor function in FN is the familiar Fraunhofer diﬀraction pattern of
a regular grating with (H + 1)-slits whose width are
(2H+1)m . This clearly exhibits the
self-similarity with respect to the scale transformation by a factor 2H + 1.

IV. DISCUSSION

We have considered the Fraunhofer interference pattern obtained from diﬀraction grat-
ings whose slits are fractally distributed. The simplest Cantor set type grating and its
generalization were explicitly constructed, and their interference patterns were studied. The
grating structure function, GN (x) =
, gives the interference pattern
function, FN (β) =
, by the diﬀraction transformations, both of which show
the repeated product structure, and have the self similarity with respect to the scaling by
(cid:17)
a factor of 2H + 1. However, the fractal dimension of the function of interference pattern
FN (β) is not fully understood.

(cid:16)

For general gratings with fractal distribution, analytic results may not be easily obtained.
For example, if one tries the triadic Cantor generator whose segments are of unequal lengths,

5

the computations are no longer straightforward because the factorization is not possible. In
this case numerical calculations would be interesting. If we consider a generator function
g(x) of general form, it is not easy to picturize the product function GN (x) nor to evaluate
the diﬀraction pattern function FN (β).

Another direction of generalization is to consider higher dimensional fractal diﬀraction

gratings which we intend to study in future.

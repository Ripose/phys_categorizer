spin.

The Lagrangian 1

2 ǫ0c2∂µAν∂µAν is shown to yield a non-gauge-invariant theory of electromag-
netism. The potential is uniquely determined by the inhomogeneous wave equation and boundary
conditions at inﬁnity. The Lorenz condition and minimal coupling follow from charge conservation.
Electromagnetic spin is conserved and a spin operator is proposed without sacriﬁcing covariance.
Covariant quantisation is carried out without redeﬁning the metric. It is a valid alternative to the
standard approach since it makes the same experimental predictions.

Maxwell’s equations express electromagnetism in terms of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, Fµν . They imply that a
∂ν Aµ, but only up to a contribution of the form ∂µχ, with
potential ﬁeld Aµ can be deﬁned through Fµν = ∂µAν
χ an undeﬁned scalar ﬁeld. In spite of its incomplete deﬁnition, it is Aµ and its derivatives, not Fµν , that constitute
the functional variables in Lagrangian formalism. The equations can be derived from the standard [1] gauge-invariant

or any equivalent Lagrangian diﬀering from it by a four-divergence. Such Lagrangians, however, yield non-gauge-
symmetric Noether conservation laws, asymmetric energy-momentum tensors, non-conserved spin and disallow quan-
m, derived from
tisation. Interaction with matter is implemented by addition to Eq. (1) of a matter Lagrangian,
the free matter Lagrangian by the minimal substitution, pµ
m also is not gauge-invariant.
Although corrective procedures [2] can be found in any textbook on ﬁeld theory, it would be preferable to avoid these
problems from the beginning.

It will ﬁrst be shown how the wave equation, furnished with boundary conditions at inﬁnity, uniquely determines
the ﬁeld and that charge conservation leads to the Lorenz condition. Then the conservation laws are discussed and a
spin operator is deﬁned. Subsequently, minimal coupling is derived from charge conservation and the force density is
discussed. A simple application of the formalism is given. Finally, covariant quantisation is discussed and it is argued
that there is no need for a redeﬁnition of the metric.

Now adopt as a boundary condition that Aµ = 0 in a point P=(r,t) if jµ = 0 in the entire light cone of P. The
derivatives of Aµ also vanish, if jµ = 0 in the union of the light cones of an inﬁnitesimal environment of P. With this,
Eq. (3) fully determines Aµ in the point P if jµ is speciﬁed in the entire light cone of P, for the diﬀerence of two ﬁelds
must vanish if they correspond to the same current distribution in the entire light cone of P. An equivalent statement
of the boundary condition is that a source at P does not contribute to the potential outside the lightcone of P.

Maxwell’s equations follow from Eq. (3) and the Lorenz condition, ∂µAµ = 0. It is now shown that the Lorenz
condition follows from charge conservation, ∂µjµ = 0, which in turn requires that
m is real. Indeed, from this and
Eq. (3) it follows that ∂λ∂λ∂µAµ = 0 in the entire Minkowski space, or, in k-space, kλkλkµAµ(k) = 0. This implies
kµAµ = 0 or kµkµ = 0, or both. If kµkµ = 0 then Aµ is a solution of the free wave equation in entire Minkowski space
and must vanish due to the boundary condition. This leaves the possibility that kµAµ(k) = 0, so that ∂µAµ = 0.
Thus the Lorenz condition is fulﬁlled if and only if charge is conserved. It is a consequence of a property of matter
and in no way an intrinsic restriction of the degrees of freedom of Aµ. This also means that, whereas in the standard
(gauge invariant) theory ”non-conservation of charge is inconceivable” [9], this is not the case here.

L

Another consequence of charge conservation is minimal coupling. If the charged matter is described by a complex

ﬁeld ψ, the conserved current is given by

This expression is equal to Eq. (4) only if ∂µψ, ∂µψ∗ and eAµ occur in
m in the combinations i∂µψ

i∂µψ∗ + eAµ. Thus minimal coupling is necessary and suﬃcient to assure current conservation in Eq. (4).

Tf is symmetric under exchange of its indices, as required by the proportionality of energy ﬂux and momentum density
(6) also coincides with the deﬁnition of the energy-momentum tensor in general relativity,
(Ref. [10],
F is the unique Lagrangian that yields an energy momentum tensor with
∂
m ), including the matter
these properties. It is important to note that the total energy-momentum,
contribution, has the same value as in the standard theory. Still, the distribution of energy-momentum, which is
d3xj0Aµ that
not an experimentally accessible quantity, is diﬀerent. Moreover a quantity of energy-momentum of
is attributed to the matter energy-momentum in the standard theory is attributed to the ﬁeld energy-momentum
here. As a consequence the energy density of the ﬁeld is not positive deﬁnite. Notably, an electrostatic ﬁeld exhibits a
negative energy density. The momentum density of static ﬁelds strictly vanishes, whereas the Poynting vector ascribes
momentum density to crossed static electric and magnetic ﬁelds [11].

As an example, consider a system of interacting classical point charges. The Lorentz force on a single particle equals
the rate of change of d(pµ
i )/ds. However, in the presence of a ﬁeld this does not correspond to a
conserved momentum so that the Lorentz force does not obey Newton’s third law [12]. On the other hand, the force
qAµ(ri)) and
given by Eq. (7) equals the rate of change of the conserved [13] total particle momentum
does obey Newton’s third law. The Lorentz force law follows from Eq. (7) by setting the rate of change of particle
momentum, d(muµ

qAµ(ri))/ds = jλ∂µAλ(ri), equal to the r.h.s. of Eq. (7).

The ﬁrst two terms on the r.h.s. represent the ﬁeld orbital momentum density, which is conserved because of the
symmetry of T µν
f . The remaining terms represent spin angular momentum, which is separately conserved because
f is invariant under Lorentz transformations of Aµ alone. In fact, this interpretation fulﬁlls the requirement [14]
L
that the total angular momentum reduces to spin in the rest frame. The rest frame of a ﬁeld can be deﬁned as the
one in which the total momentum vanishes. For a massless travelling wave the momentum can be made arbitrarily
small by a suitable choice of frame, but not vanish. The orbital angular momentum vanishes quadratically, while
¯h and the orbital angular
the spin vanishes linearly. If the ﬁeld is normalised to have energy ¯hω, the spin equals
momentum vanishes linearly. For a standing wave the interpretation is completely straightforward: both linear and
orbital angular momentum vanish so what remains can only be spin.

The angular momentum density is equal to Sz = Sxy = ωA2. In the standard theory, on the other hand, only orbital
angular momentum density exists and, since the Poynting vector is along ~z, its z-component vanishes. The total spin
is equal and the diﬀerence is recovered in regions of space where the wave is not plane and consequently the Poynting
vector no longer parallel to the z-direction. If a light absorbing disc with cross section D is placed in the bundle, as
shown in Fig. 1, it will experience a torque N z [15]. N z is equal to the rate of spin absorption, so that N z = cSzD.
The same reasoning would yield zero torque in the standard theory, because the z-component of angular momentum
density vanishes. In the standard approach the torque is associated with ﬁeld angular momentum generated behind the
absorber. At the edge of the cylindrical shadow cast by the disk a sharply peaked distribution of angular momentum
pointing in the negative z-direction occurs. Clearly, the standard description is far from straightforward.

FIG. 1. When an absorbent disk (A) is placed in a plane circularly polarised wave (L) casting a shadow (S), it will experience
a torque. In the present approach this equals the rate at which spin density is absorbed. In the standard approach angular
momentum is conserved because a sharply localised negative spin density forms at the edge of the shadow region.

It is now straightforward to deﬁne spin operators. The expression for the total spin,

has the form of an expectation value of the operator

Clearly, eigenfuctions of this operator should be stationary, that is they should be eigenfunctions of ∂0. For a real
vector ﬁeld this condition has to be relaxed in the following way: 1) Aµ is an eigenfunction of ∂2
0 and 2) ∂0 shifts the
phase of Aµ by π
4 in addition to multiplication by ω. Denoting the phase shift operation by R one has ∂0Aµ = ωRAµ.
The factor ω can be absorbed into the normalisation of the ﬁeld. Notably, if the ﬁeld is normalised to carry energy

Now that the validity of the classical theory has been established, the problems encountered in the covariant ﬁeld

quantisation procedure [8], are discussed. Quantisation is achieved by interpreting the total free ﬁeld energy,

as the hamiltonian of a collection of harmonic oscillators. The commutation relations between the creation and
annihilation operators are

where m is a discrete or continuous variable designating the ﬁeld mode created by a(m). For a travelling plane waves
m stands for ~k. Eq. (15) implies that

which gives

From the postulate

(15) is interpreted as a relation between
where ψ0 is the ground state. This constitutes a contradiction if Eq.
components of Aµ and gµν. The problem disappears, however, if a+µ(k) and aµ(k) are interpreted as Lorentz vectors
with µ-polarisation. In this case Eqs. (15) and (16) involve a scalar product. The distinction between a vector and
its components can be emphasized by denoting a+(µ)(m) and a(µ)(m) This suggests the possibility to deﬁne scalar
operators a(m) by

and likewise for a+(m). Here the e(µ) are unit vectors that are obtained from gµν by ﬁxing one of the indices and

combined with deﬁnition (18) and Eq.
(15) is recovered. This procedure has the advantage that the
commutativity of orthogonally polarised ﬁelds follows from Eq. (19) and needs not to be postulated. The norm of a

The probability interpretation of quantum mechanics is thus maintained, as well as Lorentz covariance, and the noto-
rious ’indeﬁnite metric’ problem is avoided. The Lorenz condition is implemented simply by using only polarisations
that obey

N (m) = a+(m)a(m).

kµǫµ = 0,

where ǫµ is the polarisation of the potential.

In summary, it was shown that the Lagrangian

2 ǫ0c2∂µAν ∂µAν leads to a valid theory of electromagnetism
with a uniquely deﬁned potential. The Lorenz condition and minimal coupling emerge as consequences of charge
conservation. The canonical spin density is covariant and conserved and permits the deﬁnition of a photon spin
operator. The ’indeﬁnite metric’ problem encountered in the covariant quantisation procedure is avoided.

We consider photonic crystal ﬁbres (PCFs) made from arbitrary base materials and
introduce a short-wavelength approximation which allows for a mapping of the Maxwell’s
equations onto a dimensionless eigenvalue equations which has the form of the Schr¨odinger
equation in quantum mechanics. The mapping allows for an entire analytical solution of
the dispersion problem which is in qualitative agreement with plane-wave simulations of
the Maxwell’s equations for large-mode area PCFs. We oﬀer a new angle on the foundation
of the endlessly single-mode property and show that PCFs are endlessly single mode for
0.42, independently of the base material.

1 Introduction

Photonic crystal ﬁbres (PCF) are a special class of optical ﬁbres where a remarkable
dielectric topology facilitates unique optical properties. Guiding of light is accomplished
by a highly regular array of air holes running along the full length of the ﬁbre, see Fig. 1.
In their simplest form the ﬁbres employ a single dielectric base material (with dielectric
function εb = n2
b) and for the majority of fabricated ﬁbres silica has been the most common
choice [1, 2]. This preference has of course been highly motivated by silica’s transparency
in the visible to infrared regimes, but has also been strongly driven by the highly matured
glass technology used in the fabrication of standard telecommunication ﬁbres. However,
a growing interest in ﬁbre optics for other wavelengths and light sources has recently
led to a renewed interest in other base materials including chalcogenide glass [3], lead
silicate glass [4], telluride glass [5], bismuth glass [6], silver halide [7], teﬂon [8], and
plastics/polymers [9].

The huge theoretical and numerical eﬀort in the PCF community has been important in
understanding the dispersion and modal properties, but naturally there has been a clear

1

emphasize on silica-based PCFs. PCFs fabricated from diﬀerent base materials typically
share the same overall geometry with the air holes arranged in a triangular lattice and
the core defect being formed by the removal of a single air-hole. However, it is not yet
fully clariﬁed how the established understanding may be transferred to the development
of PCFs made from other base materials. To put it simple; PCFs made from diﬀerent
base materials share the same topology, but to which extend do they also have optical
characteristics in common?

When addressing this question it is important to realize that the otherwise very useful
concept of scale-invariance of Maxwell’s equations [10] is of little direct use in this par-
ticular context. Since PCFs made from diﬀerent base materials do not relate to each
other by a linear scaling of the dielectric function, ε(r) 9 s2ε(r), scale invariance can-
not be applied directly to generalize the results for e.g. silica to other base materials.
Electro-magnetic perturbation theory is of course one possible route allowing us to take
small changes of the base-material refractive index into account, but in this paper we will
discuss and elaborate on an alternative approach which was put forward recently [11].

As a starting point we take the classical description based on Maxwell’s equations, which
for linear dielectric materials simplify to the following vectorial wave-equation for the
electrical ﬁeld [10]

Here, ε is the dielectric function which in our case takes the material values of either air or
the base material. For a ﬁbre geometry with rk along the ﬁbre axis we have ε(r) = ε(r
⊥)
and as usual we search for solutions of the plane-wave form ei(βrk−ωt) with the goal of
calculating the dispersion ω(β) relation.

2 Short-wavelength approximations

Today, several approaches are available for solving Eq. (1) numerically, including plane-
wave, multi-pole, and ﬁnite-element methods [12–14]. Such methods will typically be
preferred in cases where highly quantitative correct results are called for. However, nu-
merical studies do not always shine much light on the physics behind so here we will
take advantage of several approximations which allow for analytical results in the short-
wavelength limit λ
Λ. The key observation allowing for the approximations is that
typically the base material has a dielectric function exceeding that of air signiﬁcantly,
εb ≫
1. In that case it is well-known that the short-wavelength regime is characterized by
having the majority of the electrical ﬁeld residing in the high-index base material while
the fraction of electrical ﬁeld in the air holes is vanishing.

≪

The, at ﬁrst sight very crude, approximation is simply to neglect the small fraction of
electrical power residing in the air-hole regions. Mathematically the approximation is

implemented by imposing the boundary condition that E is zero at the interfaces ∂Ω to
air. Since the displacement ﬁeld D = εE is divergence free we have 0 = ε∇

that has been applied successfully to PCFs in the short-wavelength regime [15]. However,
while that approach took the ﬁeld and the dielectric function in the air holes into account
we shall here solve Eq. (3) with the boundary condition that E is zero at the interfaces to
air. We note that this of course is fully equivalent to solving Eq. (4) with the boundary
condition that Ψ is zero at the interfaces to air. Obviously, the scalar problem posed by

tion with a linear dispersion relation (i.e. Ωk ∝
the transverse conﬁnement/localization. At this point we already note how an arbitrary
base-material refractive index nb enters in the frequency associated with the longitudinal
plane-wave propagation. This is solely possible because we have a Dirichlet boundary
condition in Eq. (3) which does not depend on the refractive index of the base material.

In the following we rewrite Eq. (5) as

where now γ is a dimensionless number characterizing the conﬁnement/localization. It is
of purely geometrical origin and thus only depends on the normalized air-hole diameter

Schr¨odinger equation

The same equation was recently studied in work on anti-dot lattices in a two-dimensional
electron gas [16] and there will be many similarities between such quantum mechanical
electron systems and the present electromagnetic problem. In the language of quantum
mechanics the wavefunction ψ is subject to hard-wall boundary conditions corresponding
to an inﬁnite potential barrier in the air-hole regions. The task of calculating the optical
dispersion properties has now reduced to solving the scalar two-dimensional Schr¨odinger-
like eigenvalue problem posed by Eq. (7). The strength is obviously that Eq. (7) is material
independent and thus we may in principle solve it once and for all to get the geometry
dependence of γ and thereby the optical dispersion of the PCF. In the following we solve
Eq. (7) for diﬀerent classes of modes and compare approximate results to corresponding
numerically exact ﬁnite-element solutions.

index of the artiﬁcial periodic photonic crystal lattice. In the language of band diagrams
and Brillouin zones it is deﬁned in the Γ-point where Bloch’s theorem is particular simple;
as illustrated in Fig. 3 the wave function is subject to a simple Neumann boundary
condition on the edge ∂ ˜Ω of the Wigner–Seitz cell, i.e.

where n is a unit vector normal to the boundary ∂ ˜Ω. We thus have to solve an eigenvalue
problem on a doubly-connected domain. By a conformal mapping, leaving the Laplacian
and the boundary conditions invariant, one may in principle transform the hexagonal
shape with the circular hole of diameter d into a simple annular region of inner diameter d
and outer diameter 2R [17] leaving us with an eigenvalue problem in the radial coordinate.

3.2 Core-defect modes

While the fundamental space-ﬁlling mode, discussed above, is a de-localized mode it is
also possible to have strongly localized states, especially in the presence of defects such
as one formed by removing an air hole from the otherwise periodic lattice of air holes, see
ﬁgures 1 and 2. In this way light can be guided along the defect thus forming the core of
the ﬁbre. The requirement for corralling the light is of course that the core-defect mode
has an eigenvalue γ2
c,1 not exceeding the corresponding eigenvalue γ2
cl of the surrounding
photonic crystal cladding. To put it slightly diﬀerent the defect in the air-hole lattice
eﬀectively corresponds to a potential well of depth γ2
cl and a radius roughly given by
ρ = Λ

d/2, see Fig. 2.

In order to calculate the fundamental core-defect mode we ﬁrst note that in the limit
of d/Λ approaching 1, the problem can be approximated with that of a two-dimensional
spherical inﬁnite potential well with radius ρ = Λ
d/2, see Fig. 4. For this problem the

3.3 Two-dimensional ﬁnite-element solutions

Above we have solved the geometrical eigenvalue problem analytically by means of var-
ious approximations.
In this section we compare the quality of these results by direct
comparison to a numerically exact solution of the two-dimensional eigenvalue problem.
The developments in computational physics and engineering have turned numerical solu-
tions of partial diﬀerential equations in the direction of a standard task. Here, we employ
a ﬁnite-element approach [19] to numerically solve Eq. (7) and calculate γ2 versus d/Λ.
We employ an adaptive mesh algorithm to provide eﬃcient convergence. For cladding
mode we implement Eq. (8) directly while for the defect modes we solve Eq. (7) on a
ﬁnite domain of approximate size 10Λ
10Λ with the defect located in the center of
the domain. For d/Λ down to around 0.1 we have found this to suﬃcient to adequate
convergence for the strongly localized defect states, thus avoiding strong proximity from
the domain-edge boundary condition which for simplicity has been of the Dirichlet type.
Figure 5 summarizes our numerical results for the ﬁrst cladding mode γ2
cl as well for the
two ﬁrst core-defect modes γ2
c,2. The dashed lines indicate the corresponding
approximate expressions in Eqs. (13), (17), and (18) obtained by analytical means. As

4 Derived ﬁber optical parameters

With Eq. (6) at hand we have now provided a uniﬁed theory of the dispersion relation in
the short-wavelength regime for PCFs with arbitrary base materials and Eq. (6) illustrates
how geometrical conﬁnement modiﬁes the linear free-space dispersion relation.

In ﬁbre optics it is common to express the dispersion properties in terms of the eﬀective
index neﬀ = cβ/ω versus the free-space wavelength λ = c2π/ω. From Eq. (6) it follows
straightforwardly that

which obviously is in qualitative agreement with the accepted view that neﬀ increases
monotonously with decreasing wavelength and approaches nb in the asymptotic short-
wavelength limit as reported for e.g. silica-based PCFs [2]. Similarly, the group-velocity

This implies that the endlessly single-mode property [2, 20–22] is a wave phenomena
independent of the base material refractive index of purely geometrical origin. Higher-
order modes are only supported for d/Λ & 0.42, as seen in Fig. 5, for which VPCF & π [20].

5 Comparison to fully-vectorial plane-wave simulations

In the previous sections substantial analytical progress was made, but we still remain to
address the question to which extend the basic assumption behind Eq. (3) holds except
that it becomes exact for the fundamental modes as λ/Λ approaches zero. In Fig. 6 we
compare the analytical results for the eﬀective index in Eq. (20) to results obtained by
fully-vectorial plane-wave simulations [12] of Eq. (1). For the fundamental space-ﬁlling
mode we have employed a basis of 26
26 plane waves while for the core-defect modes we
have employed a super-cell conﬁguration of size 10Λ

10Λ in the case of d/Λ = 0.4.

Panel (a) shows results for the fundamental space-ﬁlling mode for various values of the
base refractive index. As clearly seen the theory agrees excellently in the short-wavelength
limit while pronounced deviations occur as the wavelength increases and the ﬁeld pen-
etrates deeper into the air hole regions and also vectorial eﬀects become important as
reported in [15]. Similar conclusion applies to the corresponding results in panel (c) for
the fundamental core-defect mode. While d/Λ = 0.4 is a case of particular technological
interest because of its endlessly single-mode property we would like to emphasize that
equivalent agreement is found for other values of d/Λ (results not shown). However, since
d and
the success of the approximation in Eq. (3) really is that λ/nb ≪
d for the core and cladding results, respectively, there will of course be a
λ/nb ≪
small d-dependence. However, this also indicates that the agreement will increase with
an increasing refractive index nb of the base material as has also been observed for even
higher values of nb than those studied in Fig. 6 (results not shown).

6 Discussion and conclusion

It is today more than 10 years ago that the PCF was invented by Russell and co-workers [1]
and there is a still growing community of researchers directing their eﬀorts toward fabri-
cation and experimental studies of silica-based PCFs as well as quantitative modelling of
the optical properties. At the same time the community is obviously facing the challenges
and opportunities of new exciting ﬁber materials. PCFs made from diﬀerent base mate-
rials share the same topology so it seems quite natural to assume that they also have at
least some basic optical properties in common. Let’s return to the question posed in the
introduction: to which extend do PCFs made from diﬀerent materials have optical char-
acteristics in common? The present work do to some extend address this question. Most
importantly we illustrate how the waveguide dispersion originates from the geometrical
transverse conﬁnement/localization of the mode and how the endlessly single-mode prop-
erty arises as a sole consequence of the geometry which acts as a modal sieve. In particular
we have shown how PCFs are endlessly single-mode for d/Λ . 0.42 irrespectively of the
base material an analytical expression for the wave-guide dispersion parameter applicable
to large-mode area ﬁbres.

For small-core PCFs our theory provides qualitative correct results though more quantita-
tive insight still calls for fully vectorial simulations, see e.g. [23]. However, for large-mode
area PCFs our expressions not only gives qualitative insight, but also quantitative correct
expressions which may be used in straightforward design of large-mode area PCFs with
special properties with respect to the group-velocity dispersion and the susceptibility of
the fundamental mode with respect to longitudinal non-uniformities [24].

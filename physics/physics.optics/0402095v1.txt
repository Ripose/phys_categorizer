Abstract

Considering the diﬀraction of a plane wave by a periodically corrugated half–space, we show

that the transformation of the refracting medium from positive/negative phase–velocity to neg-

ative/positive phase–velocity type has an inﬂuence on the diﬀraction eﬃciencies. This eﬀect in-

creases with increasing corrugation depth, owing to the presence of evanescent waves in the troughs

of the corrugated interface.

INTRODUCTION

The rediscovery [1] of isotropic dielectric–magnetic materials exhibiting phase velocity

vector opposed in direction to the time–averaged Poynting vector has prompted a ﬂurry of

publications during the last four years [2, 3]. Many interesting eﬀects have been predicted,

with some experimental backing as well [4, 5, 6].

Though several names have been proposed for this class of materials, we think that the

most descriptive is:

negative phase–velocity (NPV) materials [7]. In contrast, the phase

velocity and the time–averaged Poynting vectors are co–parallel in positive phase–velocity

(PPV) materials. PPV materials are, of course, commonplace and require no introduction.

That the intrinsic diﬀerence between NPV and PPV materials has recognizable conse-

quences is easily gauged from a simple problem: reﬂection and refraction of a plane wave due

to a homogeneously ﬁlled half–space. Let vacuum be the medium of incidence, while ǫ2 and

µ2 denote the relative permittivity and relative permeability of the medium of refraction.

Let a linearly plane wave be incident on the planar interface of the two mediums at an angle

θ0, (|θ0| < π/2), from the normal to the interface, and ρ(θ0) be the reﬂection coeﬃcient. If
2} is implemented, then ρ(θ0) → ρ∗(θ0), where the
the transformation {ǫ2 → −ǫ∗
asterisk denotes the complex conjugate [8]. Thus, the replacement of a NPV/PPV half–

2, µ2 → −µ∗

space by an analogous PPV/NPV half–space changes the phase of the reﬂection coeﬃcient

but not its magnitude.

What would happen if the interface were to be corrugated [9]? Surface–relief gratings

are periodically corrugated surfaces that are commonly used in electromagnetics, and many

theoretical techniques are available to compute their diﬀraction eﬃciencies [10]. Therefore,

we decided to compute and compare the diﬀraction eﬃciencies of PPV and NPV surface–

relief gratings. In this report, we present our chief results here. Section II contains a sketch

of the theoretical method we chose, while Section III is a discussion of the numerical results

obtained. An exp(−iωt) time–dependence is implicit.

II. THEORY

In a rectangular coordinate system (x, y, z), we consider the periodically corrugated

boundary y = g(x) = g(x + d) between vacuum and a homogeneous, isotropic, linear

2

material, with d being the corrugation period. The region y > g(x) is vacuous, whereas

the medium occupying the region y < g(x) is characterized by complex–valued scalars

ǫ2 = ǫ2R + iǫ2I and µ2 = µ2R + iµ2I. If this medium is of the NPV type, then [7, 11]

otherwise

ǫ2R|µ2| + µ2R|ǫ2| < 0 ;

ǫ2R|µ2| + µ2R|ǫ2| > 0 .

A linearly polarized electromagnetic plane wave is incident on this boundary from the region

y > g(x) at an angle θ0, (|θ0| < π/2), with respect to the y axis.

Let the function f (x, y) represent the z–directed component of the total electric ﬁeld for

the s–polarization case, and the z–directed component of the total magnetic ﬁeld for the

p–polarization case [12]. Outside the corrugations, f (x, y) is rigorously represented by the

following Rayleigh expansions [9]:

f (x, y) = exp

Boundary conditions at y = g(x) require the continuity of the tangential components of

the total electric ﬁeld and the total magnetic ﬁeld. Hence,

f (x, g(x)+) = f (x, g(x)−)

where σ = µ2 for the s–polarization case and σ = ǫ2 for the p–polarization case, while ˆn is

a unit vector normal to the boundary.

At this stage we invoke the Rayleigh hypothesis [9] — that is, we assume that expansions

(3) and (4), which are strictly valid outside the corrugated region, can be used in the bound-
ary conditions (8). Doing so, and then projecting into the Rayleigh basis {exp(i αmx)} +∞
we obtain a system of linear equations for {ρn} +∞

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We chose the corrugations to be sinusoidal: g(x) = 0.5 h cos(2πx/d). For this type

of boundary between vacuum and a penetrable dielectric medium, good results have been

obtained for h/d < 0.3 [14, 15]. We calculated diﬀraction eﬃciencies for refracting mediums

of both the PPV (ǫ2 = 5 + i0.01, µ2 = 1 + i0.01) and the NPV (ǫ2 = −5 + i0.01, µ2 =

−1 + i0.01) types. Calculations were made for both the s– and the p–polarization cases.

Fixing the ratio ωd/c = 2π/1.1, we plotted the diﬀraction eﬃciencies er

0 and er

−1 as well as

the absorption Pa as functions of θ0 ∈ [0, π/2) for h/d = 0.07 (Figure 1), h/d = 0.14 (Figure

2) and h/d = 0.21 (Figure 3).

When h/d = 0 — i.e., when the interface is planar — it has been shown [8] that the

transformation {ǫ2R → −ǫ2R, µ2R → −µ2R} does not change er
formation does not seem to be very eﬀective in aﬀecting er

0 when h/d = 0.07. As the
corrugations grow deeper (i.e., as h/d increases in value), the presented data shows that the

0. No wonder, the same trans-

transformation of the refracting medium from NPV/PPV to PPV/NPV increasingly aﬀects

er
0 and Pa.

Why should this be so?

Now,

for a planar

interface,

the transformation

{ǫ2R → −ǫ2R, µ2R → −µ2R} leaves the magnitude of the reﬂection coeﬃcient only unchanged

for non–evanescent incident plane waves; but that is not a true statement for incident evanes-

cent plane waves [16]. In the troughs of the corrugated interface, the total ﬁeld that exists

has both specular (n = 0) and nonspecular (n 6= 0) components. Most of the nonspecular

components are like evanescent plane waves because they are characterized by Re

= 0.

Their presence ensures that the diﬀraction eﬃciencies are aﬀected by the transformation of

β(1)
n
h

i

the refracting medium from NPV/PPV to PPV/NPV.

Before concluding, let us point out that the numerical results presented here for NPV

surface–relief gratings agree with the results of a perturbational approach, thereby validating

the limited use of the Rayleigh hypothesis for NPV gratings in the same way as for PPV

gratings [17]. Also, the emergence of homogeneous NPV materials promises new types of

gratings which could be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from their PPV counterparts.

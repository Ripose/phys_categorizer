The paper presents a critical analysis of publications devoted to one of

the methods for production of the so-called ”slow light” (the light with an

anomalously low group velocity) due to extremely high local steepness of the

dispersion curve of the medium. The method in point employs for this pur-

pose the eﬀect of coherent population oscillations accompanied by burning of

a narrow spectral hole in the homogeneously broadened absorption spectrum.

Physical model of the eﬀect proposed in the studies under consideration is

based on analysis of response of a nonlinear medium to a low-frequency inten-

sity modulation of the incident light beam. We show that all the observations

described in these papers can be easily interpreted in the framework of the

simplest model of saturable absorber and have nothing to do with the eﬀects

of hole burning and group velocity reduction.

I. INTRODUCTION

After publication of the ﬁrst impressive results on group velocity reduction by several
orders of magnitude [1,2], the eﬀects of slowing down, stoppage, storage, and release of light
attracted attention of a great number of researchers. The experiment [2], which demon-
strated the light velocity reduction by more than 7 orders of magnitude, was performed
with sodium atoms at the temperatures close to that of the Bose-Einstein condensation
(hundreds of nK) and was based on the eﬀect of electromagnetically induced transparency.
The paper [2] initiated a great number of publications, with some of them, in particular,
claiming observation of the light velocity reduction of similar scale under much less exotic
experimental conditions (e.g., at room temperature). To create a steep dispersion of the re-
fractive index, along with the eﬀect of electromagnetically induced transparency, there has
been used the eﬀect of coherent population oscillations (CPO). Observation of the CPO-
based hole burning in the absorption spectra of ruby and alexandrite crystals was reported
in [3,4]. Then, in [5,6], there has been announced observation, in these crystals, of ”slow”
and ”fast” light, i.e., the light with ”ultralow” and, in this particular case, ”negative” group
velocity. More recently, other publications have appeared that supported the proposed in-
terpretation [7,8], and, as a result, the CPO eﬀect was included into the arsenal of the ”slow
light” methods (see, e.g., [9,10]).

The goal of this publication is to show that the light-pulse delay detected in the above
experiments is a well known eﬀect of nonlinear optics. It has nothing in common with the
CPO eﬀect and is not connected with the group velocity reduction in the medium. In our
opinion, the experimental data of [3–6] provide no evidence for the ”slow light” observation,
and their interpretation is erroneous.

II. THE EFFECT OF COHERENT POPULATION OSCILLATIONS

The role of population oscillations in the coupling of the light waves with close frequen-
cies propagating in a resonant nonlinear medium was ﬁrst noted, as far as we know, by W.
Lamb in 1964 [11]. Analysis of the properties of a saturable absorber performed by Schwartz
and Tan in 1967 [12] has shown that, in the presence of a strong (saturating) pump wave, a
weak probe wave scanned in the vicinity of the strong wave frequency displays an apparent
dip in the absorption spectrum with the center at the pump frequency and with the width
corresponding to the inverse absorption relaxation time. The eﬀect had a simple and visual
physical interpretation. The combined action of two monochromatic waves, due to their
interference, gives rise to a modulation of the total ﬁeld intensity at the beat frequency.
When this frequency appears to be suﬃciently low (comparable with the inverse population
relaxation time or lower), the light intensity modulation is transformed into modulation of

2

populations (and absorption) of the optically active centers. Under these conditions, inter-
action of the monochromatic pump wave with the oscillating susceptibility of the medium
destroys its monochromaticity and gives birth to sidebands, with one of them being exactly
coincident in frequency with the probe wave and thus contributing to its intensity. This is
revealed as an apparent bleaching of the medium (or as a dip in the absorption spectrum)
in the vicinity of the pump frequency. The width of such a dip is, as a rule, smaller than
homogeneous width of the optical transition. For this reason, this eﬀect was often considered
as ”hole burning” in a homogeneously broadened spectrum.

The interest to the CPO eﬀect in 70s of the last century was stimulated, on the one hand,
by its role in the laser emission dynamics and, on the other, by the possibility to use it for
getting information about lifetimes of excited states in nonluminescent or rapidly relaxing
systems. In those years, the CPO eﬀect has been thoroughly studied both theoretically (see,
e.g., [13,14]) and experimentally [15,16]. The experimental studies mainly demonstrated
applicability of this spectroscopic phenomenon to kinetic measurements. In spite of the fact
that this eﬀect is linear with respect to the probe wave and is phenomenologically close to
the well-known eﬀect of hole-burning in the inhomogeneously broadened spectra, it results
from the multiwave interaction and is, evidently, of essentially diﬀerent nature.

The conclusion about observation of a narrow spectral dip (∆ν ≈ 37 Hz) in the homo-
geneously broadened absorption spectrum of ruby crystal was made in [3] based on analysis
of the crystal’s response to the low-frequency intensity modulation of the light beam (Ar+-
laser). The dip was treated as a usual spectral feature in the complex refractive index of
the medium.
In [5], to this narrow spectral dip, in conformity with the Kramers-Kronig
relations, was assigned an extremely steep slope of the dispersion curve, and the observation
of ”slow light” with a group velocity of 57.5 ± 0.5 m/s was reported. Similar experiments
performed with alexandrite crystals were reported in [4,6]. This crystal, behaved, at certain
wavelengths, as an inverse saturable absorber (with the absorption growing with light inten-
sity), and the CPO eﬀect, in this crystal, resulted in ”anti-hole burning” in the absorption
spectrum. The experimental observations of [6] have been interpreted in terms of ”negative”
group velocity of light (”fast” light). These papers provided the basis for a new approach to
the problem of implementation of the ”slow” and ”fast” light. To evaluate the novelty and
validity of this interpretation, let us turn to basic properties of a saturable absorber.

III. SATURABLE ABSORBER

Characteristic properties of a saturable absorber attracted attention of researchers in the
early laser epoch, in 60s, when the phthalocyanine dyes were found to be eﬃcient for laser
Q-switching. In those years, their temporal and intensity-related characteristics have been
studied in suﬃcient detail [17–20]. The simplest saturable absorber is known to be well

3

modeled by a two-level system with a high dephasing rate T −1
, Ω, where T1
is the population relaxation time and Ω is the Rabi frequency). As a good example of the
saturable absorber may also serve ruby crystal (Fig. 1a). The energy structure of chromium
ion in ruby is not two-level, but a high relaxation rate of the excited state 4F2 ((|bi in Fig.
1) to the metastable levels 2 ¯A and ¯E (|ci) makes it possible to neglect the coherent transient
processes practically at any reasonable excitation power.

In the general case (neglecting the eﬀects of propagation), dependence of intensity of the
light transmitted through a saturable absorber Iout on its intensity at the entrance I can be
presented in the form

(1)

(2)

(3)

where the transmissivity factor æ(I, t) controls all the dynamic and intensity-related

characteristics of the saturable absorber.

Under nonstationary conditions, when the light intensity varies in time, the dynamics of

transmission of the saturable absorber is dedescribed by the equation

Iout = æ(I, t)I,

˙æ =

æeq − æ
τ

Here, æeq is the equilibrium value of æ corresponding to the current light intensity, and
τ is a time constant (at low light intensities τ ≈ T1. When the light intensity is not too
high, the dependence æeq(I) can be presented in the form

æeq(I) = æ0 − æ1I,

æ1I << æ0.

As the light intensity increases, the nonlinear is usually bleached. In this case, the param-
eter æ1 is negative. There are situations, however, when absorption of the optical medium
increases with increasing light intensity, rather than decreases. This situation is typical for
certain schemes of optical orientation and is realized, in particular, in the alexandrite crys-
tal mentioned above, where, due to eﬃcient excited-state absorption, chromium ions in the
excited metastable state may absorb light, at the wavelength of excitation, stronger than
those in the ground state (Fig. 1b). For these inverse saturable absorber, æ1 > 0.

Solving Eqs. (1)–(3) for a stepwise change of the incident light intensity, one can easily
make sure that the time dependence of the transmitted light intensity, in this case, contains
two components - an inertialess (stepwise) jump and an exponential component, reﬂecting
dynamics of establishment of steady-state populations of the medium. The sign of the
exponential component, evidently, depends on the sign of æ1 (Fig. 2). In virtue of linearity
of the Fourier-transform, the appropriate response in the frequency domain will also contain
two components - a frequency- independent (”white”) pedestal and a Lorentz-wise peak in
the range of zero frequencies with a width of ∼ 1/τ . This dependence can be easily obtained

with harmonically modulated intensity

¿From Eqs. (1)–(3), neglecting the terms ∼ I 2

K(ω) ≡ æ0 − æ1I0

= |K(ω)|eiφ

Here, as usual, the complex intensities I and Iout describe the amplitude-phase relations
between harmonically oscillating light intensities at the entrance and at the exit of the
absorber.

Figure 3 shows characteristic frequency dependences of the amplitude K(ω), phase φ(ω),
and time delay δ(ω) = φ(ω)/ω of intensity oscillations of the light beam transmitted through
a usual (bleachable) saturable absorber (a) and through an inverse saturable absorber (b).
As is seen from these curves, the greatest time delay is experienced by low-frequency
spectral components of the light intensity (ω << τ −1), for which, taking into account the
condition æ1I0 << æ0 from Eq. (3), we have

∆tmax = ∆t(ω → 0) = −

æ1I0

τ

This formula yields the time delay experienced by a smooth pulse with the width much
larger than the relaxation tine τ . As expected, the time delay may constitute only a small
fraction of the pulse width.

Figure 4 shows normalized light pulses at the entrance (solid lines) and at the exit (dashed
lines) of the usual (a) and inverse (b) saturable absorber for several ratios of the pulse width
δ and relaxation time τ . As seen from the ﬁgure, the pulse propagating through a bleachable
absorber generally experiences positive time delay, whereas in an inverse absorber the delay
is negative. Note once again that all these results have been known for several decades (see,
e.g., paper [18], in which the shape of the pulse transmitted through a saturable absorber is
calculated). Let us now turn back to the experiments on observation of ”slow light” under
conditions of coherent population oscillations [5,6].

Comparison of the results presented above with the experimental data of [3–6] did not
allow us to ﬁnd any noticeable distinctions between them. Speciﬁcally, in full agreement

IV. DISCUSSION

5

with the model of saturable absorber, the amplitude of the light intensity modulation at the
exit of the absorber shows a Lorentz-wise peak in the region of low frequencies ω <
∼ 1/τ (Fig.
3 from [3]), and the phase shift of the intensity modulation, at these frequencies, is positive
or negative depending on the type of the absorber (Fig. 3 from [5] and Fig. 2 from [6]). A
positive time delay is experienced also by Gaussian pulse transmitted through a bleachable
absorber (cf. Fig. 4 from [5] and Fig. 4 of the present paper).

Thus, all the observations of [3–6], including ”slow” and ”fast” light, can be interpreted
in a fairly trivial way, in the framework of the simplest model of saturable absorber. This
model, evidently, does not imply either burning of a narrow spectral hole or any modiﬁcation
of the light group velocity in the medium.

The authors of [3–6] interpret their experimental results in a more complicated way by
representing the harmonically modulated light beam in the form of three spectral compo-
nents, with the central one playing the role of the pump and the sidebands playing the role
of the probe. Such an approach was has been repeatedly used to describe interaction of a
modulated monochromatic light with a saturable absorber and is, in principle, quite correct
[14,21]. First of all, however, the authors of [5] analyze the response of the absorber only
to one of the two side components and do not take into account their inevitable inﬂuence
upon each other (see, e.g., [21]). As follows from the model of the CPO eﬀect, when the
probe beam contains two components symmetric with respect to the pump frequency, each
of them contributes to the other one and, in turn, experiences the inﬂuence of the latter to
its own amplitude and phase. Without considering this fact, the suggested theoretical model
is, in our opinion, inadequate. It is also incorrect to apply the standard notion of group
velocity to an absorbing medium with a strong spectral dependence of absorption (under
these conditions, the spectrum and shape of the light pulse should exhibit strong changes,
and the notion of group velocity needs to be redeﬁned).

However, the main drawback of papers [3–6] is that the ”dip” detected in the space
of diﬀerence frequencies (beat frequencies between ”pump” and ”probe”) is interpreted as
a dip in the optical spectrum, which was not really observed and, under conditions of the
described experiments, could not be observed. To detect the dip, spectral width of the pump
beam (as well as of the probe) should be smaller than that of the dip. As applied to the case
of ruby crystal with a 37-Hz width of the ”dip”, the frequency of laser light should be stable
to within 14 (!) decimal digits (at least for the times of the order of inverse width of the
dip). In the experiments [3–6], the widths of the laser sources evidently exceeded the widths
of the ”burned” features by many orders of magnitude. Under these conditions, position of
the above ”narrow dip”, having no preferences in a wide spectral range, becones physically
uncertain and loses any sense.

All the aforesaid is also true for other studies in which the retarded dynamics of a
saturable absorber was attributed to the hole-burning eﬀect under conditions of CPO [7,8].

6

A diﬀerent experimental situation was realized in [22], where as the pump and the probe
were used quasi-monochromatic beams of independent laser sources, and the dip in the
homogeneously broadened spectrum of excitonic absorption of a semiconductor structure
with quantum wells was really detected in a classical way as was implied in early theoretical
papers on the CPO eﬀect (see, e.g., [14]). Based on the results of the amplitude and phase
measurements, the authors concluded that the group velocity in the system under study, due
to a high steepness of the dispersion curve in the region of the above dip, should be 9,600
m/s. This conclusion is, in our opinion, not suﬃciently well grounded. First of all, in view of
the already mentioned mutual inﬂuence of symmetric (with respect to the pump frequency)
spectral components of the light pulse, the character of its interaction with the medium
should crucially depend on its phase structure. In particular, as has shown our preliminary
analysis, for a certain phase proﬁle of the probe pulse, it proves to be insensitive to the action
of the pump and incapable of detecting the dip. This fact indicates again the nonlinear
nature of the ”hole” detected in the CPO eﬀect and incorrectness of direct application of
the Kramers-Kronig relations to this spectral feature. And, lastly, as was already mentioned,
it is inconsistent to apply the notion of the group velocity to the absorbing medium with a
strong spectral dependence of imaginary part of the refractive index.

V. CONCLUSION

The results of the above treatment allow us to conclude that the experimental data of
the papers [3–6], in which the ”slow” or ”fast” light was allegedly observed under conditions
of the coherent population oscillations, can be easily interpreted in the framework of the
simplest model of saturable absorber. In our opinion, the light pulse delay detected in these
experiments have nothing to do with the hole- (or anti-hole-) burning in a homogeneously
broadened absorption spectrum, as well as with reduction of the group velocity of light
in the medium. These delays are caused, in fact, by self-induced distortion of the pulse
propagating in the medium with intensity-dependent absorption. As for the CPO-based
hole-burning eﬀect, it can be observed only under conditions of quasi-monochromatic pump
with its spectral width smaller than the inverse population relaxation time. To observe
modiﬁcation of the light group velocity in the medium under condition of the coherent
population oscillations, the probe pulse spectrum should have approximately the same width.
To the present day, to the best of our knowledge, no experiment of this kind has been
performed. One may assume that, upon narrowing of the pump and probe pulse spectra,
the contribution to the pulse delay related to the refractive-index dispersion feature of the
medium in the region of the pump frequency will become noticeable on the background of the
eﬀects of retarded absorption considered in this paper. However, taking into account that
this eﬀect can be observed only in the absorbing medium, and the time delay of the pulse

7

may constitute only a small fraction of its width [9], this ”slow light” will not diﬀer from
the ”slow light” obtained using a saturable absorber, and the prospects of its application
for practical purposes seem highly doubtful.

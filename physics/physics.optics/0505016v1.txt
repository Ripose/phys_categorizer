The thermodynamic dual structure of linear-dissipative driven systems

Eric Smith

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The spontaneous emergence of dynamical order, such as persistent currents, is sometimes argued
I
to require principles beyond the entropy maximization of the second law of thermodynamics.
show that, for linear dissipation in the Onsager regime, current formation can be driven by exactly
the Jaynesian principle of entropy maximization, suitably formulated for extended systems and
nonequilibrium boundary conditions. The Legendre dual structure of equilibrium thermodynamics
is also preserved, though it requires the admission of current-valued state variables, and their correct
incorporation in the entropy.

The search for a theory of the emergent order found
in many driven systems, whether “self-organization” or
“dissipative structures” [1, 2], presumes that these sys-
tems are not adequately described by statistical princi-
ples such as the second law of thermodynamics.
In a
narrow sense this is certainly true, as all driven dissi-
pative systems conduct energy and possibly matter be-
tween dissimilar reservoirs. However, the second law of
thermodynamics is essentially an informational princi-
ple [3], that stable macrostates correspond to maximally
disordered distributions of microstates, constrained by
average values of dynamically conserved quantities like
energy, with Shannon-Boltzmann entropy the measure
of disorder. Nothing precludes the application of this
principle to time-dependent systems.

A phenomenological rule advanced to explain the form
of currents in near-equilibrium systems is maximal en-
tropy production [2, 4], where “entropy” means the usual
coarse-grained equilibrium functional of time-reversal-
invariant state variables. Entropy production is often
perceived as independent from the second law, capable
of opposing it and favoring the emergence of “order” in
some settings. However, the entropy production function
presumes equilibrium state variables remain meaningful,
implying that the ﬁne-grained conﬁguration of the sys-
tem locally obeys the second law in the usual sense.

Here I consider a model of linear dissipation in the On-
sager regime [4], obtained from ﬁrst principles by typical
methods of quantum optics [5], but given suﬃcient struc-
ture to represent an extended system capable of coupling
to multiple reservoirs with dissimilar temperatures.
In
equilibrium systems, the value of any intensive state vari-
able is necessarily the same for all system degrees of free-
dom, and dual to each intensive variable is an extensive
distribution-averaged observable obtained by Legendre
transformation. The imposition by the boundary con-
ditions of multiple values for a single intensive variable
overconstrains the system relative to an equilibrium, and
leads to spontaneous emergence of persistent currents.
However, I show that the stable states of such driven
systems remain consistent with Jaynesian maximization
of the exact entropy, subject to constraint of distribution-
averaged observables. Further the Legendre dual struc-
ture of equilibrium thermodynamics is preserved, if one
admits current-valued (time-reversal asymmetric) as well

as charge-valued (symmetric) state variables, and com-
putes the entropy as a function of both.

The result is that macroscopic as well as microscopic
features of the distribution are determined uniformly by
entropy maximization. The dynamical distribution is
more ordered than an equilibrium distribution at the
same average energy simply because its boundary con-
straints are more structured, which is also the origin of
the second law in equilibrium [6]. Maximum produc-
tion of coarse-grained entropy may be recovered as a
phenomenological rule from ﬁne-grained entropy maxi-
mization at each time, once the latter has ensured that
all local marginal distributions are thermal and that the
equilibrium state variables have their usual meaning.

The model is similar to Fock space models used in
quantum optics, where linear dissipation is readily de-
rived as a universality class [5]. The physical state space
of the system results from the action of D orthogo-
nal creation and annihilation operators starting from a
ground (ket) state |0i. They have commutation relations
aµ, a†
ν , µ, ν ∈ 1, . . . , D. The system has a “spa-
ν
tial” basis indexed i, in which reservoir coupling is diag-
(cid:2)
onal, and a (generally diﬀerent) basis indexed µ in which
the Hamiltonian is diagonal.

In any basis, the diagonal elements of the dyadic ma-
trix operator ˆn ≡ a†a (i.e., [ˆnµ
) constitute a
set of the independent number components in the Fock
space. The Hamiltonian (up to constants) is written

They include the equilibrium thermal distributions

marginals are eﬀectively thermal, in nonequilibrium cases

µaµ is a source of particles
from the reservoirs. The detailed structure of the reser-
voirs does not matter, though nR has the interpretation
of a mean excitation number in reservoirs that are also
systems of linear oscillators. The entropy (4) is coarse-
grained [6] because it results from projection of a re-
versible (system ⊗ reservoir) ensemble onto the degrees of
freedom of the system alone. Constant nR characterizes
suﬃciently high temperatures and reservoir dimensional-
ity [5]. Finally, Eq. (7) is an eﬀective ﬁeld equation, in

which Green’s function corrections from system-reservoir
coupling have been absorbed in specifying ˆH and ˆΣR.

Eq. (7) preserves Gaussian-coherent ensembles, with

only mean particle number evolving as

dn
dt

= i [E, n] + r (nR − n)

(8)

Particles diﬀuse from the system in proportion to n, and
conversely from the reservoir in proportion to nR.
In
a high-temperature (Boltzmann) regime, particle statis-
tics play no special role, and linear particle exchange is
expected to be representative of ubiquitous diﬀusion re-
lations such as the Fourier and Ohm laws.

If [E, nR] = 0 the eigenvectors of ˆH are coupled in-
dependently to diﬀerent reservoir components, and in
steady state ρ decomposes into a tensor product of in-
dependent thermal subsystems.
[E, nR] 6= 0 describes
“open” systems, in which unequal intensive state vari-
ables from diﬀerent components of nR induce persistent
currents at steady state.

(10)

and ρR is to be understood as the Gaussian-coherent en-
semble the reservoirs “attempt to impose” through nR.
The steady state condition dS/dt = 0 is equivalent to
the condition S(ρ)−S(ρR) = ∆(ρ; ρR) that ρ be a coarse-
graining of ρR [6]. Geometrically, nR = n − i [E, n] /r is
in the tangent plane to the surface δS = 0 at n, because
although S(ρ) arises from a projection, unitary evolution
i [E, n] within the system preserves the value of S(n).

We will generally retain time-dependent n for compar-
ison to the Onsager construction, but it is convenient to
have a closed form for the asymptotic late-time distribu-
tion, denoted

The physical reason for the emergence of currents
from coarse-graining is nicely illustrated in the asymp-

with coeﬃcients related to the physical state basis of
Fig. 1 by 2n3 = nx − ny, 2n1 = nu − nv, 2n2 = n+ − n−.
If by convention n(x,y) and n(u,v) refer to standing waves,
n± are traveling waves exchanged under time rever-
sal. Then the coeﬃcients of real n are charge-valued
state variables, and the single imaginary coeﬃcient is a
current-valued state variable. As the entropy (4) is pre-
served by arbitrary similarity transformation of n under
SU(2), charge and current state variables have identical
interpretations in terms of statistical uncertainty.

and switched under time reversal.

Hamiltonian evolution preserves n0 and n3, and oscil-

lates net charge and current excesses in time as
(n1 + in2)t = ei(Ex−Ey)t(n1 + in2)0.
The set of coarse-grainings of real nR preserving n0 and
n3 is given by (n1 + in2)λ = (nR)1/ (1 − iλ) for real λ,
and shown in Fig. 2. By Eq. (12) for ¯n, we solve for λ =
(Ex − Ey) /r. The current magnitude |¯n2| is maximized
at r2 = (Ex − Ey)2.

(15)

We may generate spontaneous currents in an extended
system as follows: At equilibrium n0 ± n3 6= 0, while
n1 = 0 (reﬂection symmetry), and n2 = 0 (time-reversal
invariance). If we couple the orthogonal (u, v) operators
to static reservoirs with diﬀerent temperatures, consis-
tent with the same n0 ± n3, linear dissipation attracts
n in Eq. (8) toward a charge asymmetry (nR)1 6= 0,
which reﬁnes the equilibrium ensemble with a new con-
straint, thus reducing its entropy. Dissipation just bal-
ances Hamiltonian charge/current conversion at a coarse-
graining ¯n of nR, where 0 < |¯n1 + i¯n2| < |(nR)1|, allow-
ing a larger entropy than S(nR) but less than equilibrium
for the same average system energy.

Returning to the general case, we may derive the clas-
sical thermodynamic dual structure for arbitrary target
nτ . If through Eq. (11) we deﬁne

Concentric circles are Hamiltonian orbits, and dashed circle
is the set of coarse grainings from given (nR)1. The angle α
obeys tan α = 1/λ = r/ (Ex − Ey).

the remaining degrees of freedom in arbitrary Tr (ρˆn) are
ﬁxed by maximizing S(ρ) subject to the single constraint
Tr [(Tr (ρˆn) − nτ ) Λτ ] = 0, because the set δS ≥ 0 from
any nτ is convex. Entropy maximization with one La-
grange multiplier for an extensive trace constraint,

δρ,λ {S(ρ) − λτ [Tr (Tr [ˆnΛτ ] ρ) − Tr [nτ Λτ ]]} = 0,

(17)

is thus a suﬃcient principle to extract ρ(nτ ), but fails
to capture the physical role of the temperatures in the
reservoir as independently speciﬁed intensive state vari-
ables.

The state variable interpretation of reservoir parame-
ters is recovered naturally, and indeed linearly, in the On-
sager regime of high temperature and weak perturbation
away from equilibrium. Suppose, for example, that the
trace constraint on nR comes from average energy and
some other charge matrix Q. Suppose a high temperature
¯βE(µ) ≪ 1, and weak perturbation β′Q(ν)/ ¯βE(µ) ≪ 1,
for all eigenvalues E(µ) of E and Q(ν) of Q. Q is a charge
if it is Hermitian with real coeﬃcients. With these trace
constraints, we may expand nR to leading order

The phenomenological result of maximal entropy pro-
duction, a variational principle for the diﬀusive currents
of equilibrium state variables, follows from minimization
of the generalized exact free energies (25) in the Onsager
regime. The phenomenological entropy is obtained by
coarse-graining the exact distribution to a product of its
marginals on diﬀerent spatial positions. The equivalent
operation here is the projection of ρ onto its diagonal
components ˜ρ in a Fock space over independent num-
ber excitations. The resulting coarse-grained entropy is
a function of the charge-valued state variables only.

As we have only introduced notation and derived linear
particle exchange for factoring the (system ⊗ reservoir)
distribution into independent marginals, that partition
will be used as an example.
It simpliﬁes the presen-
tation to consider the reservoir a uniﬁed system in its
own right (rather than a set of independent components),
with state variable nR, and distribution ρR extremized
as in Eq. (25), except with trace constraint ¯βE + β′Q, for
consistency with Eq. (18). Label the reservoir partition
function ZR, and its entropy SR computed from ρR as
for S(ρ). Let overdot denote time diﬀerentiation. Then
consider the potential

is the phenomenological “dissipation function”. Under
complete coarse-graining of both system and reservoirs,
the single function (29) would expand into the structure
of physical diﬀusion currents determined by the Hamil-
tonian, though the resulting coarse-grained entropy, even
within the system, would progressively diverge from the
exact value (4).

This formal demonstration that spontaneous emer-
gence of persistent currents need not require any new
principles beyond Jaynesian entropy maximization po-
tentially changes our understanding of the statistical na-
ture of dynamical order. States with currents are poten-
tially equivalent to equilibrium ground states, with the
dual representation of nonequilibrium boundary condi-
tions taken up by dynamical or time-reversal-asymmetric
extensive observables.

It was previously shown [7] that entropy maximization
naturally extends from equilibria to cases of thermody-
namic reversibility, an intuitive result because state vari-
ables at diﬀerent times index the same constraint set.
Less obvious, when such systems support self-organizing
phase transitions [9], their ﬁnite-temperature ﬁeld the-
ory [10] retains the structure of equilibrium up to analytic
continuation, suggesting that nonlinear positive feedback

is also consistent with entropy-maximization, if one takes
care with broken ergodicity. The current demonstration
for linear-dissipative systems extends this result to cases
in which coarse-grained entropy is not preserved. It re-
mains to determine whether positive feedbacks that in-
duce phase transitions in dissipative systems have a sim-

ilar formulation.

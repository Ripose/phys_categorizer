(Dated: February 20, 2014)

We show that the problem of ﬁnding the primary and secondary characteristic directions of a
linear lossless optical element can be reformulated in terms of an eigenvalue problem related to
the unimodular factor of the transfer matrix of the optical device. This formulation makes any
actual computation of the characteristic directions amenable to pre-implemented numerical routines,
thereby facilitating the decomposition of the transfer matrix into equivalent linear retarders and
rotators according to the related Poincar´e equivalence theorem. The method is expected to be
useful whenever the inverse problem of reconstruction of the internal state of a transparent medium
from optical data obtained by tomographical methods is an issue.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Passive linear optical elements are ubiquitous in the study of interactions between matter and polarized classical [1, 2]
or quantum light [3]. While polarizers attenuate one of two distinguished orthogonal polarization forms, linear
retarders and rotators alter the state of polarization while preserving the ﬂow of light energy through the device. The
latter two belong to the class of non-absorbing linear elements, where the term “linear” refers to the fact that the
action of such a device on the state of polarization can be conveniently described by a unitary two-by-two transfer
matrix.
In contrast, a polarizer would be represented by a Hermitean matrix. This description of linear optical
elements in terms of Hermitean and unitary matrices is called the Jones formalism [4].

In his treatise on classical light [5], Poincar´e found that any non-absorbing passive linear optical element could be
decomposed into basic linear retarders and rotators. By linear retarder we mean a homogeneously anisotropic device,
such as a piece of appropriately cut crystal, which possesses two preferred axes, called the “fast” and “slow” axis,
which are perpendicular to each other and diﬀer in the phase velocity of component waves linearly polarized along
the distinguished directions; as a consequence, light possessing a general elliptic polarization state will accumulate
a relative phase retardation between the two components and thus change its polarization state. A rotator, on the
other hand, changes the plane of linearly polarized light by a speciﬁed angle; it can be shown easily that this eﬀect
is due to a phase retardation between the two orthogonal components of circular polarization. Accordingly, a linear
retarder is determined by speciﬁcation of, e.g., the angle of the fast axis, and the relative phase retardation; while a
single rotation angle is suﬃcient to specify a rotator. This decomposition of a general non-absorbing optical element
into retarders and rotators is called the Poincar´e equivalence theorem (see [6] for a recent account).

Such a decomposition proves very useful whenever the speciﬁcation of internal properties of a transparent medium,
such as the internal stress tensor, with non-destructive methods is desired.
In particular, this issue arises in the
problem of Integrated Photoelasticity [7] where an attempt is made to reconstruct the stress tensor inside a loaded
transparent model by tomographic methods, sending polarized light through the specimen at many diﬀerent angles
and measuring the change of state of polarization. In this case we wish to reconstruct the transfer matrix U , through
the equivalent optical model consisting of a linear retarder and a rotator, from the relative retardation, and rotation,
the polarization state undergoes on passage through the material at a particular angle.

In [6] we have given a detailed account of the Poincar´e equivalence theorem and its application to construct the
equivalent optical model. In that paper, the decomposition of a given transfer matrix U into retarders and rotators
was accomplished in a somewhat pedestrian fashion, by parameterising the (three-dimensional) manifold of SU (2)
matrices in a suitable way, and then applying elementary trigonometric methods. In the present paper we accomplish
the same decomposition in a more elegant way: We show how to reformulate the problem of ﬁnding the “characteristic”
data specifying the equivalent optical model from a given transfer matrix in terms of an eigenvalue problem associated
with the unimodular factor of this transfer matrix. This method is therefore more suitable for an actual numerical
determination of the characteristic data, as we can immediately make use of pre-implemented numerical routines for
eigenvalue problems.

II. CHARACTERISTIC DIRECTIONS OF LINEAR OPTICAL ELEMENTS

As shown in [6], a lossless linear passive optical device possesses in general two so-called primary characteristic
directions [7] wm = (cos γm, sin γm), m = 1, 2, in the plane perpendicular to the entry of the optical element, which
have the following signiﬁcance: If a light beam at the entry is plane-polarized in one of the directions wm (our
convention is such as to deﬁne the direction of polarization along the electric displacement ﬁeld D) it will leave the
device again in a state of plane polarization, with the plane oriented along unit vectors w′
m), m = 1, 2,
called the secondary characteristic directions. In contrast, for any direction other than w1,2 the beam at exit will in
general be elliptically polarized. The two primary as well as the two secondary characteristic directions are always
perpendicular to each other, so that it suﬃces to specify the angle γ and γ′ of the ﬁrst elements w1 = (cos γ, sin γ) and
w′
2 is then determined up to a sign. Since the polarization
state at the exit is again linear the optical device, represented by the unitary matrix U , must act on the real polarization
vector wm according to

1 = (cos γ′, sin γ′), respectively; the second element w2, w′

m = (cos γ′

m, sin γ′

where Φ1, Φ2 are the phases picked up by the light beam entering along w1, w2, respectively. Our goal is to determine
a consistent choice of primary and secondary characteristic vectors, together with appropriate values for the phases
Φm, from a given transfer matrix U .

Since U is unitary, its determinant is a unimodular number

hence we can factorize U into

where S is now a unimodular unitary matrix, det S = 1. The choice of S is not unique, since both S and −S satisfy
det S = 1. The phase φ can be computed from (2) modulo π, the ambiguity in sign obviously related to the double-
valuedness ±S of the SU (2) factor. We therefore need to stipulate an explicit convention for the two possibilities in
the factorization: We choose φ to be the smallest possible non-negative solution of (2). Then S is uniquely determined
by eq. (3).

We can now rewrite (1) as

S wm = eiΦ′

m w

′
m , Φ

′
m = Φm − φ .

In principle we can determine the angles γ and γ′ of the primary and secondary directions wm and w′
m by parametrising
the manifold of SU (2) matrices S in a suitable way and then using elementary trigonometric relations to express these
angles in terms of the coordinates on the SU (2) manifold, as was done in [6]. However, a method that does not require
an explicit coordinate chart on the SU (2) manifold will be presented now:

Suppose that eq. (1) holds. Then (4) holds as well, and on taking the complex conjugate of the latter equation we

obtain

On eliminating w′

m from eqs. (4) and (5) we ﬁnd that the directions wm are real eigenvectors of ST S,

where the superscript T denotes a matrix transpose. We therefore need a method to obtain real eigenvectors from a
complex matrix of the form ST S, where S is an element of SU (2). To this end we show that ST S commutes with its
complex conjugate (ST S)∗: Any SU (2) matrix S can be represented in the well-known form

so that a short computation gives

the commutator

must vanish.

This relation is signiﬁcant, since it can be used, in turn, as a starting point to determine the characteristic directions
in an elegant way: Given any linear lossless device with unitary Jones matrix U = exp(iφ) S, the SU (2) factor S will
satisfy relation (9). This relation implies that the commutator

must vanish as well. The real and imaginary parts of ST S are symmetric, since ST S is. As a consequence of the
commutativity (10), both of these matrices share the same (orthogonal) system of eigenvectors wm which must be
real since the real and imaginary parts are so,

Re (ST S) wm = rm wm ,

Im (ST S) wm = jm wm .

It follows that wm are real eigenvectors of ST S as well, with eigenvalues rm + ijm. On the other hand, since ST S is
unitary, its eigenvalues must be the unimodular numbers exp(2iΦ′

m) appearing in eq. (6), so that

exp(2iΦ

′
m) = rm + ijm .

The result (11) shows that the characteristic directions wm can be obtained as the real eigenvectors of the matrices
Re ST S or Im ST S describing the optical element. Its signiﬁcance lies in the fact that the process of ﬁnding the
characteristic directions from a given transfer matrix U becomes amenable to well-established numerical routines
in Integrated Photoelasticity, or more generally, in any
for general eigenvalue problems. This problem arises e.g.
eﬀort to reconstruct the dielectric tensor inside a transparent but inhomogeneously anisotropic optical device from
tomographic measurements [8]. — This outlines the principle of our method to obtain the characteristic directions
of any transfer matrix U . To ﬁnish our discussion we now show how to ﬁx the ambiguity in signs of the eigenvectors
appearing in (6) and (11), and the associated phase ambiguity, in a consistent way:

The numerical routine will deliver two eigenvectors wm, but there are four possible choices

(w1, w2)

,

(w1, −w2)

,

(−w1, w2)

,

(−w1, −w2)

(13)

for the signs. We thus need to agree on a convention to pick a system from (13): We ﬁrst choose from ±w1 the vector
which makes an angle with the x axis whose modulus does not exceed π/2, so that the x-component of this vector is
always non-negative. Without loss of generality we may assume this to be true for +w1. Next we choose from ±w2
that vector which makes the system (w1, ±w2, e3) right-handed, where it is assumed that the light beam propagates
along e3 towards positive z-values. Without loss of generality we may assume that this is satisﬁed by +w2. The
phases Φ′

m can now be obtained from (12), but obviously only modulo π,

1 + π , Φ

Accordingly we can determine the associated secondary characteristic directions w′
due to the phase ambiguity. We therefore have four possibilities

for the secondary system. We now impose two conditions similar to those that made the choice of wm unique: Firstly,
we require that the suitable candidate ±w′
1 for the ﬁrst element makes an angle with w1 whose modulus is not larger
than π/2. Assuming that this is the case for w′

1, we must have

where w′
so that the vector triad (w′

1 = (cos γ′, sin γ′). We then still have the ambiguity of ±w′

2; our second condition now is to select this sign

2 is the correct choice.

We have now ﬁxed the ambiguous signs of the characteristic directions; as a consequence, the phases Φ′

m are
determined by eq. (4) up to multiples of 2π. This last indeterminacy is intrinsic and cannot possibly removed. Thus
m < π, it being understood that the values of Φ′
we stipulate to let the phases Φ′
1
and Φ′
2 are diﬀerent; for, if they were equal, they would have been part of the phase φ which was extracted out of U
in eq. (2). As a consequence,

m take values in the interval −π ≤ Φ′

where we have denoted (column) vectors as |wi and (row) covectors as hw|, reminiscent to quantum-mechanical
conventions.

III. RELATION TO THE POINCAR´E EQUIVALENCE THEOREM

Finally we show how the representation (18) of S in terms of characteristic directions and phases is related to the
decomposition of a lossless linear optical element according to the Poincar´e equivalence theorem [5]: To this end we
represent eq. (18) in the basis e1, e2 of Cartesian coordinate vectors pertaining to the laboratory frame: Using the
notation hei|S|eji = Sij we see that (18) takes the form

Sij =

, R(γ)mj = hwm|eji

R(γ) =

cos γ sin γ
−sin γ cos γ(cid:19)

(cid:18)

,

using the notation conventions of [6]. The vectors in the pairs (w1, w2) and (w′
2) are orthogonal, and have been
constructed to make a right-handed system together with e3. It follows that the matrices R(γ), R(−γ′) are proper
rotation matries having unit determinant, i.e. elements of SO(2). Then, since det S = 1 it follows that det J ′ = 1,
which implies that the eigenvalues Φ′
2 = 2πN . But, according to (17) this
restriction can be made stronger,

m must sum up to a multiple of 2π, Φ′

1 + Φ′

1, w′

Finally, on multiplying (19) with exp(iφ) we ﬁnd on using (3) and (21) that

2 = 0 .

We recognize that J(0, δ) is the Jones matrix of a linear retarder whose fast axis, for δ > 0, coincides with the x axis of
the laboratory system, so that light plane-polarized along e1 (e2) accumulates a relative phase −δ/2 (δ/2) on passing
through the device, without changing its linear polarization form, or the orientation of the plane of polarization. On
using the fact that the transfer matrix of a linear retarder with fast axis making a nonvanishing angle γ with the x
axis is given by

we can rewrite (22a) in the equivalent forms

U = J(γ

The decompositions (22), (24) express the fact that any linear lossless optical device can be replaced by a sequence
of one linear retarder and one or two appropriate rotators, at least as far as its optical properties are concerned.
The ﬁctitious optical device comprised of these retarders and rotators is called the equivalent optical model. — The
physical and mathematical content of (22), (24) is called the Poincar´e equivalence theorem. The decompositions as
given above coincide with the forms given in [6].

We have presented a method to determine the primary and secondary characteristic directions of a linear lossless
optical device from an eigenvalue problem formulated in terms of the unimodular factor of the transfer matrix of
the optical element. This approach is conceptually more elegant than methods using explicit parametrisations of the
manifold of SU (2) matrices, and is furthermore amenable to pre-implemented numerical routines, thus making the
decomposition of the transfer matrix in terms of equivalent linear retarders and rotators numerically more convenient.
The relation of this result to the associated Poincar´e equivalence theorem has been explained.

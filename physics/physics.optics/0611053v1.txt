Spatial Correlation Functions of
Random Electromagnetic Fields in the Presence of a
Semi-Inﬁnite Isotropic Medium

We extend a previous analysis of spatial correlation functions for classical electromagnetic vector
ﬁelds near a perfectly conducting boundary [PRE, 73, 036604 (2006)] to the case of an isotropic
semi-inﬁnite medium with planar interface and characterized by a ﬁrst-order impedance boundary
condition. The analytical results are illustrated with calculations for the case of point separations in
the direction perpendicular to the interface. For the incident plus reﬂected ﬁeld, the dependence of
the complex-valued and inhomogeneous spatial correlation function on the permittivity, permeability
and conductivity of the medium is determined. For the refracted ﬁeld, the spatial correlation is again
complex-valued but homogeneous and highly sensitive to the value of the refractive index. Based
on the derived dependencies, novel nonlocal measurement methods for precision characterization of
electromagnetic material properties are suggested. The inﬂuence of the directionality of incidence
for electromagnetic beams is investigated. Narrowing the beam width results in a slower decrease
of the amplitude of the correlation function as a function of point separation. Previously obtained
asymptotic results for statistically homogeneous random free ﬁelds are retrieved as special cases.

INTRODUCTION

By extending a series of earlier studies for homoge-
neous free ﬁelds [1]–[5], we recently derived and analyzed
spatial correlation functions of inhomogeneous random
classical electromagnetic (EM) ﬁelds in [6]. In that anal-
ysis, the conﬁguration consisted of a perfect electrically
conducting (PEC) inﬁnite planar boundary, resulting in
a superposition of incident and reﬂected hemispherical

statistically isotropic random ﬁelds in front of the inter-
face. Since a PEC boundary exhibits constant, i.e., angle-
and polarization-independent reﬂection coeﬃcients for
both perpendicular (transverse electric, TE) and parallel
(transverse magnetic, TM) wave polarizations, the reﬂec-
tion of a statistically isotropic incident ﬁeld exhibits an
isotropic angular spectrum as well. On the other hand,
the spatial correlation of the incident plus reﬂected ﬁelds
was found to be inhomogeneous (i.e., dependent on the
absolute distance of either one of the two point locations
with respect to the interface), as a consequence of the
statistical ﬁeld anisotropy imposed by the EM boundary
condition at the interface. First-order statistics (prob-
ability distributions) of the energy density for this con-
ﬁguration were derived in [7], which were also found to
exhibit inhomogeneity through action at-a-distance.

In this paper, we extend this previous study by con-
sidering spatial correlation functions for EM ﬁelds in the
presence of a semi-inﬁnite isotropic medium, as a sec-
ond canonical conﬁguration of fundamental interest. The
impedance boundary condition causes the reﬂection and
transmission coeﬃcients to depend on both the polariza-
tion state (TE, TM, or hybrid) and the angle of incidence.
As a result, the angular spectra of both the reﬂected
and refracted ﬁelds are now no longer hemispherically
isotropic, but are nonuniformly weighted across the solid
angle of incidence. Secondly, we investigate the inﬂuence
of directional incidence (sectorial solid angle of incidence
centered around a central direction), including narrow
EM beams as a limiting case.

The present analysis and results are relevant to sev-
eral practical problems of interest, e.g., coherence prop-
erties of stellar light transmitted through an atmosphere

or inside optical instruments, radio waves reﬂected by the
Earth’s soil or ionosphere, multipath scattering by man-
made objects or precipitation, multi-mode cavities, etc.
The ﬁeld coherency – which is the basic EM quantity in
such scenarios – is expressed in terms of reﬂection and
transmission coeﬃcients for plane waves impinging onto
a single planar interface. By extension, results more gen-
eral multi-layer conﬁgurations are obtained without diﬃ-
culty, by simply substituting the Fresnel coeﬃcients for a
semi-inﬁnite medium with corresponding expressions for
stratiﬁed media.

The integral (1) is valid for inhomogeneous random ﬁelds
and hence applicable to the present conﬁguration, un-
like homogeneous random ﬁelds which, strictly, require
a Fourier-Stieltjes representation incorporating general-
ized ﬁelds (distributions).
Incidence and refraction of
the plane waves in the upper and lower hemispheres Ω0
and Ω is governed by angles θ0 and θ, respectively, for
their propagation direction relative to the surface nor-
mal. The wavenumber within the refracting medium is

For a general stratiﬁed multi-layered medium,
in-
cluding the particular case of a semi-inﬁnite isotropic
medium, TE and TM waves constitute a set of uncoupled
eigenmodes. Hence, their contributions to the resultant
ﬁeld can be evaluated separately and then superimposed,
at any location. We refer to Sections II and III of [6] for
notations and detailed calculations of the TE/TM de-
composition of a random ﬁeld with respect to the surface
normal. For an isotropic semi-inﬁnite medium and TE
polarization, the resultant (i.e., incident plus reﬂected)

respectively. The coherencies now exhibit complex-
harmonic dependencies on the separation distance only,
as in the case of free random ﬁelds in an inﬁnite homo-
geneous medium. Thus, unlike for the incident plus re-
ﬂected ﬁeld, the spatial correlation of the refracted ﬁeld
is homogeneous, i.e., dependent on k∆z = k
only.
Physically, this is a consequence of the fact that no in-
terference exists beyond the interface. Nevertheless, be-
cause of the θ0-dependence of T⊥,k, the coherency of the
refracted ﬁeld is diﬀerent from that of the incident ﬁeld.

B. Lossless isotropic dielectric medium

As a second special case, we analyze the eﬀect of the
permittivity of a lossless isotropic dielectric medium on
the scf. For brevity, we now limit the presentation to
results for the amplitude of the vector ﬁeld E only.

ℜ

[ρE(k0∆z)] and

For the refracted ﬁeld, Fig. 5 shows that the permittiv-
ity manifests itself by a decrease of the ﬁrst zero crossing
distance (correlation length) for
[ρE(k0∆z)], with asso-
ciated shifts of the local maximum and minimum values
toward lower values of k0∆z. Also, the amplitudes of
[ρE(k0∆z)] increase with increasing
ℜ
ǫ/ǫ0. Similar ﬁndings apply to ρEz (k0∆z) and ρEt (k0∆z)
(not shown). The high sensitivity of ρE(k0∆z) to the
in combination with its insensitivity to
value of ǫ/ǫ0,
k0z0, suggest that measurements of ρE(k0∆z) may be
used as a precision method for determining the refrac-
tive index of a transparent substance.

For the incident plus reﬂected ﬁeld, Fig.

6 shows
ρE(k0∆z; k0z0) in the half-space of incidence at k0z0 =
ǫ/ǫ0. Comparing the

with Fig. 4 for a PEC
+
surface, it is noticed that ρE(k0∆z) is qualitatively sim-
ilar, but quantitative diﬀerences exist, particularly for
k0∆z
1. Thus, the scf for the reﬂected ﬁeld can be
used to distinguish between conducting and high-k di-
electric media, both of which exhibit high reﬂectivities
making them otherwise diﬃcult to discern in scalar local
measurements.

C. Directional incidence

So far, the direction of incidence (θ0, φ0) of the random
ﬁeld onto the interface was assumed to be uniform within
the upper hemisphere (Ω0 = 2π sr, viz.,
π/2 < θ0 <

φ0 < π). In practice, particularly in millimeter-
wave and optical regimes, the wavevectors of the incident

IV. CONCLUSION

The reﬂection and transmission properties of an
isotropic magneto-dielectric medium have been shown to
have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the spatial correlation func-
tions of normal, tangential and total EM random vector
ﬁelds, as a consequence of the EM boundary conditions.
An analysis of the corresponding eﬀects on the proba-
bility distribution of the energy density of the total ﬁeld
for this conﬁguration will be presented in a forthcoming
paper.

The eﬀect of changes in the constitutive parameters on
the correlation length is in general ambiguous, because a
decreasing ﬁrst-zero crossing distance of the scf is usually
accompanied by an increase in its amplitude,
,
ρE(k0∆z)
|
|
so that e.g. the two deﬁnitions investigated in Section V

of [6] yield diverging tendencies for such changes.

Since the above formulation is in terms of TE and TM
reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients for plane waves,
the analysis can be extended without eﬀort to investigate
the scf for more general stratiﬁed conﬁgurations with
uncoupled eigenpolarizations of this kind, e.g., multi-
layered stratiﬁed media as well as uniaxial anisotropic
media, by substituting the appropriate functional forms
of these coeﬃcients.

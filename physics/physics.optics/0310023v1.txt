Abstract: Extremely asymmetrical scattering (EAS) is a highly res-
onant type of Bragg scattering with a strong resonant increase of the
scattered wave amplitude inside and outside the grating. EAS is realized
when the scattered wave propagates parallel to the grating boundaries.
We present a rigorous algorithm for the analysis of non-steady-state
EAS, and investigate the relaxation of the incident and scattered wave
amplitudes to their steady-state values. Non-steady-state EAS of bulk
TE electromagnetic waves is analyzed in narrow and wide, slanted,
holographic gratings. Typical relaxation times are determined and com-
pared with previous rough estimations. Physical explanation of the pre-
dicted eﬀects is presented.

1 Introduction

Extremely asymmetrical scattering (EAS) is a radically new type of Bragg scattering
in slanted, periodic, strip-like wide gratings, when the ﬁrst diﬀracted order satisfying
the Bragg condition (scattered wave) propagates parallel to the front grating bound-
ary [1–9]. The main characteristic feature of EAS is the strong resonant increase of the
scattered wave amplitude, compared to the amplitude of the incident wave at the front
boundary [1–9]. Other unique features of EAS include additional resonances in non-
uniform gratings [5], detuned gratings [8], in wide gratings when the scattered wave
propagates at a grazing angle with respect to the boundaries [6], and the unusually
strong sensitivity of EAS to small variations of mean structural parameters at the grat-
ing boundaries [9]. The additional resonances may result in amplitudes of the scattered
and incident waves in the grating that can be dozens or even hundreds of times larger
than that of the incident wave at the front boundary [5–9].

One of the main physical reasons for all these unusual features of EAS is the diﬀrac-
tional divergence of the scattered wave inside and outside the grating [2–6, 9]. Indeed,

1

the scattered wave results from scattering of the incident wave inside the grating, and
propagates parallel to the grating. Thus, it is equivalent to a beam located within the
grating, of an aperture equal to the grating width. Such a beam will diverge outside the
grating due to diﬀraction. Therefore, steady-state EAS is formed by the two physical
eﬀects – scattering and diﬀractional divergence. Based on the equilibrium between these
processes, an approximate analytical method of analysis of EAS, applicable to all types
of waves, has been developed [2–4, 6, 8, 9].

A reasonable question is which of the EAS resonances are practically achievable?
Any resonance is characterized by a time of relaxation, and if this time is too large,
the corresponding resonance cannot be achieved in practice. In the case of EAS, large
relaxation times may result in excessively large apertures of the incident beam being
required for the steady-state regime to be realized [4]. It is obvious that knowledge
of relaxation times and relaxation (non-steady-state) processes during EAS is essential
for the successful development of practical applications of this highly unusual type of
scattering.

Until recently, only estimates of relaxation times for EAS in uniform gratings have
been made [2–4]. The analysis was based on physical assumptions and speculations [3,
4], rather than direct treatment of non-steady-state regime of EAS. Simple analytical
equations for the relaxation times were derived [3, 4]. However, the accuracy of these
equations is questionable, since their derivation did not take into account re-scattering
processes in the grating. Moreover, these equations are not applicable in the presence
of the additional resonances [5, 6, 8].

Therefore, the ﬁrst aim of this paper is to present an eﬃcient numerical algorithm
for the rigorous analysis of non-steady-state EAS of bulk electromagnetic waves in wide
uniform and non-uniform holographic gratings. The second aim is to investigate non-
steady-state EAS and accurately determine relaxation times in narrow and wide uniform
periodic gratings. In particular, amplitudes of the incident wave (0th diﬀracted order)
and scattered wave (+1 diﬀracted order) inside and outside the grating will be deter-
mined as functions of time and coordinates after the incident wave is “switched on.”

2 Structure and methods of analysis

Consider an isotropic medium with a slab-like, uniform, holographic grating with a
sinusoidal modulation of the dielectric permittivity (see ﬁg 1):

ǫs = ǫ + ǫg exp(iqxx + iqyy) + ǫ⋆
ǫs = ǫ,

g exp(−iqxx − iqyy),

if 0 < x < L,
if x < 0 or x > L,

(1)

where L is the grating width, ǫg is the grating amplitude, the mean dielectric permittiv-
ity ǫ is the same inside and outside the grating, qx and qy are the x and y components
of the reciprocal lattice vector q, q = 2π/Λ, Λ is the period of the grating, and the
coordinate system is shown in ﬁgure 1. There is no dissipation in the medium (ǫ is real
and positive), and the structure is inﬁnite along the y and z axes.

Non-steady-state EAS in this structure occurs when the incident wave is switched on
at some moment of time. Then, both the incident and scattered wave amplitudes inside
and outside the grating evolve in time and gradually relax to their steady-state values
at t = +∞. This occurs when the incident pulse, having an inﬁnite aperture along the
y and z axes, is the product of a sinusoid and a step function of time.

However, the numerical analysis of this inﬁnitely long (in time) pulse is inconve-
nient, since its Fourier transform contains a δ-function. Therefore, in order to calculate
non-steady-state amplitudes of the incident and scattered waves in the structure at
an arbitrary moment of time t = t0, we consider a rectangular (in time) sinusoidal

incident pulse of time length 2t0, amplitude E00, and angle of incidence θ0 (ﬁg. 1),
which has a simple analytical Fourier transform. We also assume that the incident pulse
is switched on instantaneously (with the amplitude E00) everywhere in the grating.
That is, we ignore the process of propagation of the pulse through the grating. This
assumption allows a substantial reduction in computational time. It is correct only if
the time t0, at which non-steady-state amplitudes are calculated, is signiﬁcantly larger
than tg = (L/ cos θ0)/(cǫ−1/2) – the time of propagation of the incident pulse across the
grating. We will see below that this condition is satisﬁed (for most times) since typical
relaxation times τ ≫ tg.

Thus, at t = 0, the front of the pulse is at the rear grating boundary, i.e. the incident
ﬁeld is zero behind the grating (at x > L). This means that if the angle of incidence
θ0 6= 0 (ﬁg. 1), then the amplitude of the incident pulse is not constant along a wave
front. Therefore, the incident pulse experiences diﬀractional divergence, and the spatial
Fourier transform should be used. However, this divergence can be ignored in our further
considerations, since it may be signiﬁcant only within several wavelengths near the front
of the pulse, i.e. for times ≈ 10−14 s or smaller (this is the time for the pulse to travel a
distance of a few wavelengths). This time is several orders of magnitude less than typical
relaxation times (see below). Therefore, only for very short time intervals after switching
an incident pulse on can noticeable errors result from the above approximations.

The frequency spectrum of this input is determined from its analytical Fourier trans-
form. As a result, the incident pulse is represented by a superposition of an inﬁnite
number of plane waves having diﬀerent frequencies and amplitudes, all incident at θ0.
Note that the spectrum is the incident pulse depends on the pulse width 2t0, and is
diﬀerent for every time t0 at which we calculate the ﬁelds. The steady-state response of
the grating to each plane wave is determined by means of the rigorous theory of steady-
state EAS [7], based on the enhanced T-matrix algorithm [10, 11], or the approximate
theory [8] (if applicable). Thus the frequency spectrum of the incident and scattered
waves inside and outside the grating is obtained, and their amplitudes as functions of
the x-coordinate at any moment time can be found using the inverse Fourier transform.
Due to the geometry of the problem, the non-steady-state incident and scattered wave
amplitudes do not depend on the y-coordinate.

Note that the inverse Fourier transform is taken at t = t0, i.e. at the middle of the
incident pulse, in order to minimize numerical errors. The inverse Fourier transform is
found by direct integration, to allow a non-uniform set of frequency points to be used.
The rapid variation of the frequency spectra at certain points, and the wide frequency

3

spectrum of the input for small t0 make it infeasible to use the fast Fourier transform.
The calculations are carried out separately for each moment of time. Therefore, there is
no accumulation of numerical errors, and the errors that are noticeable at small times
≈ 10−14 s (see above) disappear at larger times.

This approach is directly applicable for all shapes of the incident pulse, as well as
for an incident beam of ﬁnite aperture. However, for beams of ﬁnite aperture, we should
also use the spatial Fourier integral.

Since the approximate theory is directly applicable for all types of waves (including
surface and guided waves in periodic groove arrays [2, 3, 9]), the developed approach
to non-steady-state scattering is also applicable for all types of waves (if used together
with the approximate theory).

3 Numerical Results

Using the described numerical algorithm, non-steady-state EAS of bulk TE electromag-
netic waves in uniform holographic gratings given by eqn (1) has been analyzed. The
grating parameters are as follows: ǫ = 5, ǫg = 5 × 10−3, θ0 = 45◦, and the wavelength
in vacuum (corresponding to the central frequency ω0 of the spectrum of the incident
pulse) λ0 = 1 µm. The Bragg condition is assumed to be satisﬁed precisely for the ﬁrst
diﬀracted order at ω = ω0:

k1(ω0) = k0(ω0) − q,

(2)

where k0(ω) are the frequency dependent wave vectors of the plane waves in the Fourier
integral of the incident pulse, k1(ω) are the wave vectors of the corresponding ﬁrst
diﬀracted orders (scattered waves), k1(ω0) = k0(ω0) = ω0ǫ1/2/c, k1(ω0) is parallel to
the grating boundaries (ﬁg. 1), and c is the speed of light. Note that if ω 6= ω0, k1(ω)
is not parallel to the grating boundaries [8].

Typical relaxation of amplitudes of the scattered wave (+1 diﬀracted order) and
incident wave (0th diﬀracted order) over time inside and outside the gratings of widths
L = 10 µm, 28 µm, and 80 µm is shown in the animations in ﬁg. 2. The time dependencies
of non-steady-state amplitudes of the scattered wave (+1 diﬀracted order) at x = 0,
L/2, and L, and the transmitted wave (0th diﬀracted order at x = L) are shown in
ﬁg. 3 for the same grating widths. Note that L = 28 µm is approximately equal to the
critical width Lc [5]. Physically, Lc/2 is the distance within which the scattered wave
can be spread across the grating by means of the diﬀractional divergence, before being
re-scattered by the grating [5]. All the curves in ﬁgures 2 and 3 can equally be regarded
as approximate or rigorous, since both the theories in the considered structure give
practically indistinguishable results [7].

Fig. 3. The time dependencies of normalized non-steady-state amplitudes of (a–c)
the ﬁrst diﬀracted order (scattered wave) |E1/E00|, and (d) the zeroth diﬀracted
order (transmitted wave) |E0(x = L)/E00|. The grating widths are L = 10 µm ((a)
and curve (i) in (d)), L = 28 µm ≈ Lc ((b) and curve (ii) in (d)), and L = 80 µm
((c) and curve (iii) in (d)). The scattered wave amplitudes (a–c) are shown at (1)
the front boundary (x = 0), (2) the rear boundary (x = L), and (3) the middle of
the grating (x = L/2).

If L < Lc, then the relaxation at the front and rear grating boundaries occurs
practically simultaneously (see ﬁgures 2(a) and 3(a)). In the middle of the grating,
the scattered wave amplitude grows slightly faster at small t. This is due to energy
losses from the scattered wave, caused by diﬀractional divergence of the wave near the
boundaries (the edges of the scattered beam). This eﬀect becomes more obvious with
increasing grating width, and is especially strong if L ≈ Lc (ﬁg. 3(b)). This is because
the eﬀect of the diﬀractional divergence in the middle of the grating (in the middle
of the beam) becomes weaker with increasing grating width (i.e. beam aperture). At
the same time, at the edges of the beam (at the grating boundaries) the divergence is
strong, resulting in a signiﬁcant reduction of the rate of change of the non-steady-state
scattered wave amplitudes (compare curves (1) and (2) with curve (3) in ﬁg. 3(b)).
However, in wide gratings (with L > Lc), the relaxation occurs ﬁrst near the front
boundary, and then the steady-state scattered wave amplitudes start spreading towards
the rear boundary (ﬁg. 2(c)). Therefore, the relaxation process in the middle of the
grating and especially at the rear boundary tends to slow down compared to that near
the front boundary – compare curves (1) and (2) in ﬁgs. 3(b,c).

The relaxation near the front boundary takes place more or less smoothly, except
for some not very signiﬁcant oscillations in wide gratings near the end of the relaxation
process (curves (1) in ﬁgs. 3(a–c)). The same happens in the middle of the grating and
at the rear boundary in narrow gratings (L < Lc). However, if L ≥ Lc, the relaxation
curves in the middle of the grating and at the rear boundary display a complex and
unusual behavior at small and large time intervals (see curves (2) and (3) in ﬁgs. 3(b,c)).
The unusual and complex character of relaxation processes in wide gratings is es-
pecially obvious from the time dependencies of non-steady-state incident (transmitted)
wave amplitude at the rear grating boundary (ﬁgs. 2(c), 3(d)). In wide gratings, these
dependencies are characterized by signiﬁcant oscillations with minima that are close to
zero – see ﬁg. 2(c) and curve (iii) in ﬁg. 3(d). The typical number of these oscillations
increases with increasing grating width (compare curves (ii) and (iii) in ﬁg. 3(d)). The
minima in these oscillations tend to zero with increasing L. When the amplitude of the
transmitted wave at the rear grating boundary is close to zero, almost all energy of the
incident wave is transferred to the scattered wave. In wide gratings this may happen
several times during the relaxation process (ﬁgs. 2(c), 3(d)).

The relaxation times at the grating boundaries and at x = L/2, determined as the

5

times at which the amplitudes reach (1 − 1/e) of their steady-state values, are:

L

τ |x=0

10 µm 4 × 10−11 s
28 µm 6 × 10−12 s
80 µm 7.4 × 10−12 s

τ |x=L/2
4 × 10−11 s
1.7 × 10−12 s
1.2 × 10−11 s

τ |x=L
4 × 10−11 s
2.4 × 10−11 s
3.4 × 10−11 s

The relaxation times for narrow gratings, determined by means of the developed algo-
rithm, are about three times smaller than those previously estimated [4]. The signiﬁcant
overestimation of relaxation times in paper [4] is due to not taking into account the ef-
fects of re-scattering of the scattered wave in the grating. Re-scattering reduces the
transmitted wave amplitude during the relaxation process (ﬁg. 3(d)). Thus, the energy
ﬂow into the scattered wave is increased, and the relaxation times are reduced (for more
detailed discussion of re-scattering see [5]).

During the process of relaxation, the scattered wave propagates a particular distance
along the y-axis. Therefore, the relaxation times determine critical apertures lc (along
the y-axis) of the incident beam, that are required for steady-state EAS to be achieved
(see also [4]). For example, for ﬁg. 3(a) (with the largest values of τ ), the critical aperture
of the incident beam is lc = cτ ǫ−1/2 cos θ0 ≈ 0.4 cm, which does not present any problem
in practice.

4 Conclusions

This paper has developed an eﬃcient numerical algorithm for the approximate and rig-
orous numerical analysis of non-steady-state EAS of waves in uniform slanted gratings.
An unusual type of relaxation with strong oscillations of the incident and scattered wave
amplitudes has been predicted for gratings wider than the critical width.

If used in conjunction with the approximate theory of steady-state EAS [2–4, 8], the
developed algorithm is immediately applicable for the analysis of non-steady-state EAS
of all types of waves, including surface and guided modes in periodic groove arrays.

Typical relaxation times have been calculated for narrow and wide gratings. It has
been shown that these times are signiﬁcantly smaller than previous estimates [3,4]. The
corresponding critical apertures of the incident beam that are required for achieving
steady-state EAS have also been determined. The obtained results demonstrate that
steady-state EAS can readily be achieved in practice for reasonable beam apertures and
not very long gratings.

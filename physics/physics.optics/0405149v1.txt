Abstract

Using three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations we show that a strongly nonlinear plasma

wave excited by an ultrahigh intensity laser pulse works as a compact high-brightness source of X-

ray radiation. It has been recently suggested by A. Pukhov and J. Meyer-ter-Vehn, Appl. Phys. B

74, 355 (2002), that in a strongly nonlinear regime the plasma wave transforms to a “bubble”,

which is almost free from background electrons. Inside the bubble, a dense bunch of relativistic

electrons is produced. These accelerated electrons make betatron oscillations in the transverse

ﬁelds of the bubble and emit a bright broadband X-ray radiation with a maximum about 50 keV.

The emission is conﬁned to a small angle of about 0.1 rad. In addition, we make simulations of

X-ray generation by an external 28.5-GeV electron bunch injected into the bubble. γ-quanta with

up to GeV energies are observed in the simulation in a good agreement with analytical results.

The energy conversion is eﬃcient, leading to a signiﬁcant stopping of the electron bunch over 5 mm

interaction distance.

The development of novel high-brightness compact X-ray sources is important for many

research, industrial and medical applications. Synchrotron light sources (SLSs) are the most

intense X-ray sources today. In an SLS, the radiation is generated as a result of relativistic

electrons scattering by a bending magnet, magnetic undulators or wigglers [1], or by high-

power laser pulses (Compton scattering) [2, 3, 4, 5]. Recent experiments, which explore the

interaction of an intense 28.5-GeV electron beam with plasma at Stanford Linear Accelerator

Center (SLAC) [6, 7], have shown that an ion channel can be successfully used as a wiggler

to produce the broadband X-ray radiation: the electron beam propagating in plasma blows

out the background electrons and generates an ion channel.

A relativistic electron running along the ion channel undergoes betatron oscillations about

the channel axis due to the restoring force acting on the electron by the uncompensated ion
charge. For small amplitudes, r0kb ≪
motion with the betatron frequency ωb = ckb = ωp/√2γ. Here r0 is the radial excursion
of the electron, ωp = p4πe2ne/m is the background plasma frequency, ne is the elec-

1, the betatron oscillation is close to a harmonic

tron density that is equal to the ion charge density in the channel, γ is the relativistic

Lorentz factor of the electron, e is the electron charge, m is the electron mass and c is

the speed of light. Relativistic electrons executing betatron oscillations in the ion channel

emit short-wavelength EM radiation [8, 9]. Some features of this radiation spectrum have

been studied in the recent publications [7, 10]. The fundamental wavelength of this radi-

ation is close to λ

λb = 2π/kb. The emission at the fundamental frequency has been call ion channel laser

in the work of D. Whittum et al [11].

If the amplitude of the betatron oscillations be-

comes large, then the electron radiates high harmonics.

If the plasma wiggler strength,

K = γkbr0 = 1.33

10−10pγne [cm−3]r0 [µm], is so high that K

spectrum becomes quasi-continuous broadband. It is similar to the synchrotron spectrum,

which is determined by the universal function S(ω/ωc), where S (x) = x R

In the SLAC experiment [6], the ion channel has been produced by the electron beam

itself in the blow-out regime [12], when the electron beam density, nb, is higher than the

plasma density. The density of a relativistic electron beam cannot be very high because of

the technology reasons. This leads to a serious limitation on the gain in the radiated power,

which is quadratic in plasma density.

The use of a high-power laser could overcome this limitation. The high-power laser

pulse can expel plasma electrons by its ponderomotive force and create the ion channel [13].

Moreover, the strongly nonlinear broken-wave regime has been recently observed in 3D PIC

simulations [14]. In this regime, the background electrons are completely evacuated from

the ﬁrst period of the plasma wave excited behind the laser pulse, and an “electron bubble”

is formed. The ion density in this bubble is many orders of magnitude higher than that in a

simple beam-plasma interaction. For example, the ion density in the laser-produced channel
can be as high as 1019 cm−3 [13, 14]. This is 105 times higher than that in the recently

reported beam-plasma experiment [6]. Therefore the radiated power in the laser-produced
channel may be 1010 times higher. The bubble moves with the group velocity of the laser

pulse, which is close to the speed of light. A relativistic electron bunch injected into the

bubble can propagate inside the bubble over a very long distance. Hence, in spite of the

small length of the bubble itself, the electrons can oscillate in the bubble for a long time.

It has been recently shown by three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations that

a dense quasi-monoenergetic bunch of relativistic electrons, collected from the background

plasma, can be generated inside the bubble [14]. Because of the bubble focusing the bunch

has a much higher density than the background plasma. In the present work we show that

betatron oscillations of the bunch in the transverse ﬁelds of the bubble lead to the eﬃcient

X-ray generation, which can be used for the developing of table-top high-brightness X-ray

radiation sources.

We perform a numerical simulation of the X-ray generation in laser-plasma interactions for

3

the strongly nonlinear broken-wave regime when the bubble is formed behind the laser pulse.

We use the fully 3D PIC code Virtual Laser-Plasma Laboratory [15]. The incident laser pulse

is circularly polarized, has the Gaussian envelope a(t, r) = a0 exp(
L), and the
wavelength λ = 0.82 µm. Here a = eA/mc2 is the relativistic laser amplitude, rL = 8.2 µm,
TL = 22 fs, a0 = 10. The laser pulse propagates in a plasma with the density ne = 1019 cm−3.

Fig. 1 presents snapshots of the laser pulse (the colored scale) and the electron density

(the black/white scale) at diﬀerent distances. The laser pulse has passed 14 Rayleigh lengths
(ZR = πr2

L/λ) after the interaction time Tint = 4500λ/c. Thus, the lifetime of the bubble is
10 ps. Electrons, trapped in the bubble, form the relativistic bunch. We

about 3500λ/c

observe as the bubble stretches and the bunch elongates with time.

Despite the fact that the bunch density is higher than the background ion density, the

transverse force acting on the accelerated electrons, F⊥, is mainly determined by the electro-

static focusing force from the ions, see Fig. 2a. This is because the charge force of relativistic

electrons and the self-generated magnetic force almost cancel each other [16]. The energy

spectrum of the electron bunch is shown in Fig. 2b. We observe formation of the quasi-

monoenergetic peak [14]. At ct = 4000λ the peak is located at 360 MeV. We calculate the

corresponding wiggler strength of K

89

synchrotron regime. The number of electrons in the bunch is about 6.5

≃

≫

1. Thus, the electrons emit X-rays in the
1010 at this time.

×

The total energy of electrons of the bunch is about 3.3 J that is about 20% of the laser pulse

energy. The number of betatron oscillations experienced by the electrons up to this time
was N0 = cTint/λb ≃

8.6.

To simulate the X-ray generation we suppose that at any given moment of time, the elec-

tron radiation spectrum is synchrotron-like [9]. The spectrum integrated over solid angle is
deﬁned by S(ω/ωc). The critical frequency ωc is given by the relation ωc = (3/2)γ2

/(mc),

F⊥

F⊥ is the transversal to the electron momentum force. In our PIC code, we follow trajecto-

ries of each electron and calculate the emission during the interaction. The emitted radiation

exerts a recoil on the electron [9]. The recoil force was included into the equations of electron

motion in our simulations.

The synchrotron spectra at ct = 1000λ and ct = 4500λ are presented in Figs. 3 (a,

b). The surfaces shown in Figs. 3 (a,b) give the number of photons within 0.1% of the
bandwidth (∆ℏω = 10−3ℏω) per solid angle, 2π sin θdθ: ˜NX = ∆ωd2NX/(2π sin θdωdθ). It

is seen from Fig. 3 (b) that the relativistic bunch radiates highly energetic photons within a

4

very narrow cone. The maximum of the radiation spectrum is located at about 50 keV. The

analytical estimates for electron energy predict the maximum of S(x)

0.3ℏωc ≃

55 keV

that is in a good agreement with the numerical simulation data. It is seen from Fig. 3 that

the radiation from the bunch is conﬁned within the angle θ

0.1 rad and the theoretical

≃

estimate is about 0.2 rad. The photon ﬂux (the number of photons per second in 0.1%

bandwidth) and the spectral brilliance of the source at ct = 1000λ and ct = 4500λ are

shown in Figs. 3 (c, d). We can estimate the ﬂux and the brilliance using the following

To emphasize the advantage of the X-ray generation in the laser-produced ion channel in

comparison with that in the self-generated channel, we perform a numerical simulation of

the X-ray emission from an external 28.5-GeV electron bunch. The bunch has a diameter

2r0 = 24.6 µm and a length Lb = 82 µm with the total charge Qb = 5.4 nC. The plasma

and laser pulse parameters are the same as in the previous simulation. The electron beam

density was much smaller than that of the background plasma, so that the laser pulse and

bubble dynamics is not strongly aﬀected by the external electron bunch. At the beginning of

interaction the front of the electron bunch is close to the center of the laser pulse (see Figs. 4

(a)). The head of the bunch has overtaken the laser center by some 46λ after the interaction

time Tint = 4500λ/c. The number of betatron oscillations during the interaction time was
N0 = cTint/λb ≃
structurally stable during the full interaction and the bunch is focused at this moment of

1.1. It is seen from Fig. 4 (b) that the laser pulse and the bubble remain

time.

The synchrotron spectrum after the interaction time Tint = 4500λ/c is presented in

Fig. 5 (a). In the present simulation we do not consider the emission from the background

plasma electrons. At the given plasma density, the plasma wiggler strength parameter is

about K

817. It is seen from Fig. 5 (a) that the relativistic bunch radiates highly energetic

≃

photons within a very narrow cone. The maximum of the bunch radiation spectrum is located

at about 210 MeV. The analytical estimates predict the maximum of S(x)

0.3ℏωc ≃

≃

385

MeV. The disagreement is caused by the bunch stopping because of the radiation damping

force. We also observe a signiﬁcant photon ﬂux up to the energy of 10 GeV. The radiation

from the bunch is conﬁned within the angle θ

10 mrad that is close to the theoretical

≃

5

1011.

×

estimate 15 mrad. The total number of photons emitted by the bunch are about 2

This means that every electron of the bunch emits about 6 photons. The estimation for the
photon number with the critical frequency ωc is NX = Ne h
electrons in the bunch. The estimation is in a good agreement with the numerical simulation

, where Ne is the number of

NXi

results. The bunch lost about one third of its energy after Tint. The energy distribution of

the bunch electrons after the interaction is shown in Fig. 5 (b). The photon ﬂux and the

brilliance versus the photon energy are shown in Figs. 5 (c,d). The brilliance at the beginning

of interaction is slightly higher than at the end because, at the beginning, the bunch is not

yet focused and, therefore, emits at small angles. It follows from the Figs. 5 (c,d) that the

photon energy, ﬂux and brilliance of the X-ray emission from laser-produced ion channel are

several orders of magnitude higher than the ones observed in the self-generated ion channel

[6].

In Conclusion, we propose a novel compact and intense x-ray radiation source based on

the strongly nonlinear broken-wave laser-plasma interaction. The brilliance of this source

is some two orders of magnitude higher than that of the best x-ray sources available today

[17]. In addition, the radiation is polychromatic, covers that multi-keV range and comes in

sub-100 fs pulses. This bright novel source of femtosecond X-ray pulses will have important

scientiﬁc applications by enabling the direct measurement of atomic motion and structural

dynamics in condensed matter on the fundamental time scale of a vibrational period [3].

The 100 fs time scale is characteristic for atomic motion associated with ultrafast chemical

reactions, nonequilibrium phase transitions, surface dynamics and even ultrafast biological

processes.

In addition, our proposed radiation source provides a suﬃcient number of photons per

pulse to carry out these studies in a single-shot regime. This is crucially important, e.g., for

the biological processes. The polychromaticity of the radiation source may allow to probe

simultaneously diﬀerent atomic species in complex or disordered materials.

The proposed radiation source can be a table-top laser, and the plasma interaction length

is less than a centimeter. This must be compared with many 100 m structures of the

conventional synchrotron sources [17]. The high ion density in the laser-plasma wiggler

provides several orders of magnitudes higher energies of the x-ray photons than that observed

in the recent experiment with self-generated ion channels [6] and in the designed FELs.

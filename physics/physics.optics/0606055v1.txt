Non-classical Energy Conservation in Multi-wave Systems: ”Extra Energy” and
”Annihilation of Energy”

The energy conservation is a general law of nature. In the classical physics, the energy WAB of a
conservative system AB that contains the objects A and B is equal to a sum of the energies WA and
WB of the isolated objects A and B, WAB = WA + WB. We show that if the objects A and B are
two waves or they do have a wave nature of microscopic (quantum) objects, the energy conservation
does not exhibit the law W = WA + WB. The ”extra energy”, ”negative energy” and ”annihilation
of energy” are predicted for multi-wave (multi-beam) systems. The phenomena are discussed in
the context of extraordinary transmission of light and matter by subwavelength aperture arrays [for
example, see T.W. Ebbesen et al., Nature (London) 391, 667 (1998)) and E. Moreno et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 95, 170406 (2005)].

The scattering of waves by apertures is one of the ba-
sic phenomena in the wave physics. The most remarkable
feature of the light scattering by subwavelength apertures
in a metal screen is enhancement of the light by excitation
of electron waves in the metal. Since the observation of
enhanced transmission of light through a 2D array of sub-
wavelength metal nanoholes [1], the phenomenon attracts
increasing interest of researchers because of its poten-
tial for applications in nanooptics and nanophotonics [2].
Recently, the enhanced transmission through subwave-
length apertures was predicted also for matter waves [3].
The enhancement of light is a process that can include
resonant excitation and interference of surface plasmons
[3, 4, 5, 6], Fabry-Perot-like intraslit modes [7, 8, 9, 10],
and evanescent electromagnetic waves at the metal sur-
face [11]. In the case of thin screens whose thickness are
too small to support the intraslit resonance, the extraor-
dinary transmission is caused by the excitation of sur-
face plasmons or their matter-wave analog, surface mat-
ter waves [3, 4, 5, 6]. In this Letter, we show another
mechanism that provides a great transmission enhance-
ment not by coupling to the surface electron or matter
waves but by interference of diﬀracted waves in the far
ﬁeld.

The transmission enhancement without assistant of
surface waves can be explained in terms of the follow-
ing theoretical formulation. We ﬁrst consider the trans-
mission of light through a structure that is similar but
simpler than an array of holes, namely an array of par-
allel subwavelength slits. The structure consists of a
thin metal screen with the slits separated by many wave-
length. To exclude the plasmons from our model, the
metal is considered to be a perfect conductor. Such a
metal is described by the classic Drude model for which
the plasmon frequency tends towards inﬁnity. Owing to
the great distance between the slits, the electromagnetic
ﬁeld at one slit is assumed to be independent from other
slits. The transmission of the slit array is determined
by calculating the light power in the far-ﬁeld diﬀraction

zone. The waves diﬀracted by each of the independent
slits are found by using the Neerhoﬀ and Mur approach,
which uses a Green’s function formalism for a rigorous
numerical solution of Maxwell’s equations for a single,
isolated slit [12, 13, 14]. The calculations show a big,
up to 5 times, resonant transmission enhancement near
to the Fabry-Perot wavelengths determined by an array
period. To clarify the numerical result, we then present
an intuitively transparent analytical model, which quan-
titatively explains the resonant enhancement in terms of
the far-ﬁeld interference of the propagating waves pro-
duced by the independent slits. The model predicts the
∼5-times (resonant) and ∼1000-times (nonresonant) en-
hancements for both the light and matter waves passing
through a perforated metallic or dielectric screen, inde-
pendently on the apertures shape. Veriﬁcation of the
analytical formulae by comparison with data published
in the literature supports these predictions. The Wood
anomalies in transmission spectra of optical gratings, a
long standing problem in optics [15], follow naturally
from interference properties of the model.

Let us ﬁrst investigate the light transmission by using
the rigorous model. The model considers an array of M
independent slits of width 2a and period Λ in a screen
of thickness b ≪ λ. The screen placed in vacuum is illu-
minated by a normally incident TM-polarized wave with
wavelength λ = 2πc/ω = 2π/k. The magnetic ﬁeld of the
wave ~H(x, y, z, t) = U (x)exp(−i(kz + ωt))~ey is assumed
to be time harmonic and constant in the y direction. The
transmission of the slit array is determined by calculat-
ing all the light power P (λ) radiated into the far-ﬁeld
diﬀraction zone, x∈[−∞, ∞] at the distance z ≫ λ from
the screen. The total per-slit transmission coeﬃcient,
which represents the per-slit enhancement in transmis-
sion achieved by taking a single, isolated slit and placing
it in an M -slit array, is then found by using an equation
TM (λ) = P (λ)/M P1, where P1 is the power radiated by
a single slit. Figure 1 shows the transmission coeﬃcient
TM (λ), in the spectral region 500-2000 nm, calculated for

2

anism responsible for the enhancement. To clarify the
results of the computer code and gain physical insight
into the enhancement mechanism, we have developed an
analytical model, which yields simple formulae for the
diﬀracted ﬁelds. For the ﬁelds diﬀracted by a narrow
(2a ≪ λ, b ≥ 0) slit into the region |z| > 2a, it can
be shown that the Neerhoﬀ and Mur model simpliﬁes to
an analytical one. For the magnetic ~H = (0, Hy, 0) and
electric ~E = (Ex, 0, Ez) ﬁelds we found:

the array parameters: a = 100 nm, Λ = 1800 nm, and
b = 5 × 10−3λmax. The transmitted power was computed
by integrating the total energy ﬂux at the distance z = 1
mm over the detector region of width ∆x = 20 mm. The
transmission spectra TM (λ) is shown for diﬀerent values
of M . We notice that the spectra TM (λ) is periodically
modulated, as a function of wavelength, below and above
a level deﬁned by the transmission T1(λ) = 1 of one iso-
lated slit. As M is increased from 2 to 10, the visibility of
the modulation fringes increases approximately from 0.2
to 0.7. The transmission TM exhibits the Fabry-Perot
like maxima around wavelengths λn = Λ/n (n=1, 2, ...).
The spectral peaks increase with increasing the number
of slits and reach a saturation (T max
M ≈ 5) in amplitude
by M = 300, at λ ≈ 1800 nm. The peak widths and the
spectral shifts of the resonances from the Fabry-Perot
wavelengths decrease with increasing the number M of
slits. From the data of Fig. 1, one can understand that
enhancement and suppression in the transmission spectra
are the natural properties of an ensemble of independent
subwavelength slits in a thin (b ≪ λ) screen. The spec-
tral peaks are characterized by asymmetric Fano-like pro-
ﬁles. Such modulations in the transmission spectra are
known as Wood’s anomalies. The minima and maxima
correspond to Rayleigh anomalies and Fano resonances,
respectively [15]. A surprising prediction of the model is
a weak Wood’s anomaly, which is present in a classical
Young type two-slit system (M = 2).

The above-presented data is based on rigorous calcula-
tion of the energy ﬂux by using the electromagnetic ﬁeld
evaluated numerically. The transmission enhancement is
achieved by taking a single, isolated slit and placing it
in an array. The interference of the waves diﬀracted by
independent slits can be considered as a physical mech-

form, in contrast to a common opinion that a subwave-
length aperture diﬀracts light in all directions uniformly
[16]. The ﬁelds produced by an array of M independent
slits are given by ~E(x, z) = P

m=1 ~Hm(x + mΛ, z), where ~Em and ~Hm are

the ﬁelds of an m-th beam generated by the respective
slit. As an example, Fig. 2(a) compares the far-ﬁeld dis-
tributions calculated by the analytical formulae (1-5) to
that obtained by the rigorous model. We notice that the
distributions are undistinguishable. Thus, the analytical
model not only supports results of our rigorous model,
but presents an intuitively transparent explanation of the
enhancement in terms of the interference of the beams
produced by the multi-beam source. The array-induced
decrease of the central beam divergence (Figs. 2(b) and
2(c)) is relevant to the beaming light [17], and the non-
diﬀractive light and matter beams [18].

The analytical model accurately describes the ﬁelds
~E and ~H, but what is about the transmission coeﬃ-
cient? The ﬁeld power P , which determines the co-
eﬃcient TM ,
is found by integrating the energy ﬂux
|~S| = | ~E × ~H ∗ + ~E∗ × ~H|. Thus, the model accurately
explains also the light transmission. We now consider the
predictions in light of the key observations published in
the literature for the two fundamental systems of wave
optics, the single-slit and two-slit systems. The major
features of a single-slit system are the intraslit resonances
and the spectral shifts of the resonances from the Fabry-
Perot wavelengths [8]. In agreement with the predictions

[8], the formula (4) shows that the transmission T =
P/P0 = (a/k)[Re(D)]2 + [Im(D)]2 exhibits Fabry-Perot
like maxima around wavelengths λn = 2b/n, where P0 is
the power impinging on the slit opening. The enhance-
ment and spectral shifts are explained by the wavelength
dependent terms in the denominator of Eq. (4). The en-
hancement (T (λ1)≈b/πa [18]) is in contrast to the atten-
uation predicted by the model [8]. The Young type two-
slit conﬁguration is characterized by a sinusoidal mod-
ulation of the transmission spectra T2(λ) [19, 20]. The
modulation period is inversely proportional to the slit
separation Λ. The visibility V of the fringes is of order
0.2, independently of the slit separation. In our model,

high-frequency modulations with the sideband-frequency
fs(Λ) ≈f1(λ) + f2(Λ, λ)∼1/Λ (Figs. 1 and 3) are pro-
duced as in a classic heterodyne system by mixing two
waves having diﬀerent spatial frequencies, f1 and f2.
Although our model ignores the plasmons, its prediction
for the visibility (V ≈ 0.1) of the fringes and the resonant
wavelengths λn = Λ/n compare well with the plasmon-
assisted Young’s type experiment [19] (Fig. 3).
In the
case of b ≥ λ/2, the resonances at λn = Λ/n can be
accompanied by the intraslit resonances at λn = 2b/n.
Some diﬀerence between the calculated and measured
values shows that the plasmonless and plasmon-assisted
resonances can compete in certain situations. It can be
mentioned that although our model considers a screen
of perfect conductivity, polarization charges develop on
the metal surface. The proponents of surface polari-

tons, however, do not adhere strictly to traditional sur-
face plasmons. We considered TM-polarized waves be-
cause TE modes are cutoﬀ by a thick slit. In the case
of a thin screen, TE modes propagate into slits so that
magneto-polaritons develop. Because of the symmetry of
Maxwell’s equations the scattering intensity is formally
identical with ~E and ~H swapping roles. Again, no tradi-
tional surface plasmons are present in our model.

In order to gain physical insight into the mechanism
of plasmonless enhancement in a multi-slit (M ≥2) sys-
tem, we now consider the dependence of the transmis-
sion TM (λ) on the slit separation Λ. We assume that
the slits are independent also at Λ → 0. According to
the Van Citter-Zernike coherence theorem, a light source
(even incoherent) of radius r = M (a + Λ) produces a
transversally coherent wave at the distance z≤πRr/λ in
the region of radius R. Thus, in the case of Λ ≪ λ,
the collective emission of the ensemble of slits gener-
ates the coherent electric and magnetic ﬁelds, ~E =
m=1 ~Emexp(iϕm)≈M ~E1exp(iϕ) and ~H≈M ~H1exp(iϕ).

Consequently, the maximum power of the emitted light
scales with the square of the number of slits (beams),

M

P ∼ M 2. Therefore, the transmission (TM ∼P/M ) grows
linearly with the number of slits, TM ∼M . For a given M ,
the function TM (λ) monotonically varies with λ. Such an
enhancement regime (ﬁrst regime) is shown in Fig. 4. At
appropriate conditions, the transmission can reach 1000-
times enhancement (M = λz/πR(a + Λ)). The transmis-
sion enhancement in the second regime does not require
close proximity of the slits. In the case of R ≥ λz/πr
(Λ≥λ), the beams arrive at the detector with diﬀer-
ent phases ϕm. Consequently, the power and transmis-
sion grow slowly with the number of slits (Figs. 1-4).
According to our model, the transmission TM exhibits
the Fabry-Perot like maxima around wavelengthsnega-
tive λn = Λ/n. The constructive and destructive inter-
ference of the beams leads respectively to the enhance-
ment and suppression of the transmission amplitudes as
in a classical heterodyne system (Figs. 1 and 3).

The analytical model gives not only intuitively trans-
parent explanation of the plasmonless transmission en-
hancement, but in contrast to the previous studies, pre-
dicts the enhancement for the matter waves. Indeed, in
our model, the enhancement is based on coherent ex-
citation of an assemble of slits and interference of the
diﬀracted waves (beams). The constructive interference
is provided not by coupling between the slits, but by
a geometrically well-deﬁned phase relationship between
wave amplitudes at diﬀerent lateral locations in the far
ﬁeld. Thus, the enhancement mechanism depends nei-
ther on the nature (light or matter) of the ﬁelds ψm nor
on material and shape of the apertures. For instance, in
the ﬁrst enhancement regime, the ﬁxed phase correlation
leads to the M -times enhancement of the ﬁeld ampli-
M
tude, ψ = P
m=1 ψm exp(iϕm)≈M ψ1 exp(iϕ), and con-
sequently to the M -time transmission enhancement. Due
to Babinet’s principle, the model predicts the enhance-
ment also in the reﬂection spectra. Another surprising
prediction of the model that the destructive interference
of the ﬁelds at the detector can lead to the zero trans-
mission. Indeed, the interference of the positive (ψ) and
negative (−ψ = ψ exp(iϕ + π)) ﬁelds produces a ﬁeld
with the zero amplitude and energy. The value T =0 is
obtained by summing up the respective positive and neg-
ative energies. Notice that the amplitudes of the ﬁelds
ψm can rapidly decrease with increasing the distances x,
y and z. However, due to the enhancement and beaming
mechanisms (Figs. 1-4), an array produces a propagating
wave ψ with low divergence. Such a behavior is in agree-
ment with the Huygens-Fresnel principle, which consid-
ers a propagating wave as a superposition of secondary
spherical waves.

The phenomena of enhanced and zero transmission are
strange from a point of view of the energy conservation.
Indeed, the energy conservation is a general law of nature.
In the classical physics, the energy WAB of a conservative
system AB that contains the objects A and B is equal to
a sum of the energies W A and W B of the isolated objects

A/2mA + p2

A and B, WAB = WA + WB. For an example, the kinetic
energy KAB of the system of two macroscopic objects is
given by KAB = p2
B/2mB. If the objects A
and B are two waves or they do have a wave nature of
microscopic (quantum) objects, the energy conservation
does not exhibit the law W = WA + WB. It can be eas-
ily demonstrated that the energy of two harmonic light
waves having the same amplitudes (EA = EB = E0) and
energies (WA=WB=W0=E0E∗
0 R dx) is given by WAB
= WA + WB + 2E0E∗
0 R cos(ϕA(x) − ϕB(x))dx, where
ϕA(x) and ϕB(x) are the wave phases at the coordi-
nate x. The interference term, which is the additional
energy from a point of view of the classical (non-wave)
physics, is the positive or negative energy associated with

same phases (ϕA(x) = ϕB(x)), the energy is given by
WAB = W0 + W0 + 2W0, where 2W0 is the ”extra energy”
according to the classical physics. Correspondingly, the
energy of the M waves is given by WAB = M 2W0. An-
other counter-intuitive feature of the two-wave system is
the ”annihilation of energy” (WAB = W0 +W0+(−2W0))
in the case of FA(x) − FB(x) = π. Notice that the to-
tal energy is always positive, while the ”additional” en-
ergy can be negative. The ”negative energy” cannot be
separated from the total positive energy of the system.
Furthermore, the ”negative energy” cannot be extracted
from the system and transformed to the external system.
Therefore, the ”negative energy” can be considered as
the internal virtual energy. Although, the constructive
and destructive interference are well known for the light
intensity, up to now, the interference phenomenon for
the energy have been considered as unphysical. We have
showed the ”extra energy”, ”negative energy” and ”anni-
hilation of energy” for multi-wave (multi-beam) systems
in the frame of the extraordinary transmission of light
and matter by subwavelength aperture arrays.

It is worth noting that the presented model is similar
in spirit to the dynamical Bloch-waves diﬀraction model
[21], the Airy-like model based on the Rayleigh ﬁeld ex-
pansion [22], and especially to a diﬀracted evanescent
wave model [11]. The diﬀerence arises from a fact that
the models [11, 21, 22] consider the case of M = ∞, while
predictions of our model strongly depend on the number
M 6= ∞ of slits. In addition, our model deals with in-
dependent slits, while the models of Refs.
[11, 21, 22]
consider the slits electromagnetically coupled via the pe-
riodic boundary conditions. There is an evident resem-
blance also between our model and a Dicke superradi-
ance model [23] of collective emission of an ensemble of
atoms. A quantum reformulation of our model can help
us to understand why a quantum entangled state of pho-
tons is preserved on passage through a hole array [24].
The quantum model will be presented in our next paper.
Notice, that the surface waves can couple the radiation
phases of the diﬀerent slits, so that they get synchronized,
and a collective emission can release the stored energy

as an enhanced radiation. This kind of enhancement is
of diﬀerent nature compared to our model because the
model does not require coupling between the slits.

In conclusion, we showed that the energy conserva-
tion does not exhibit the ”classic law” if the physical
objects are waves or they do have a wave nature of mi-
croscopic (quantum) objects. The ”extra energy”, ”neg-
ative energy” and ”annihilation of energy” are predicted
for multi-wave (multi-beam) systems. The phenomena
were discussed in the context of extraordinary transmis-
sion of light and matter by subwavelength aperture ar-
rays [T.W. Ebbesen et al., Nature (London) 391, 667
(1998)) and E. Moreno et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 95,
170406 (2005)]. We showed that a physical mechanism
based on the ”non-classic energy conservation” provides
the transmission enhancement and beaming of light and
matter not by coupling to the surface waves but by in-
terference between diﬀracted waves (beams) in the far
ﬁeld. A surprising prediction of the model is a fact that
the destructive interference of the ﬁelds at the detector
can lead to the zero transmission. The Wood anomalies
in transmission spectra of optical gratings, a long stand-
ing problem in optics, follows naturally from interference
properties of the model. Another prediction of the model
is a weak Wood’s anomaly, which is present in a classi-
cal Young type two-slit system (M = 2). We believe that
the presented results give inside into the nature of energy
conservation. The results can be also useful for experi-
mentalists who develop nanodevices based on transmis-
sion and beaming of light or matter by subwavelengths
apertures.

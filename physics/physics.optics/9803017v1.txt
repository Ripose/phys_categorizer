Abstract

It is shown that the SU (1, 1)-like and SU (2)-like two-photon coherent states
can be combined to form a O(3, 2)-like two-photon states. Since the O(3, 2)
group has many subgroups, there are also many new interesting new coher-
ent and squeezed two-photon states. Among them is the two-photon sheared
state whose symmetry property is like that for the two-dimensional Euclidean
group. There are now two-phonon coherent states which may exhibit symme-
tries not yet observed for photons, including sheared states. Let us note that
both SU (1, 1) and S(3, 2) are isomorphic to the symplectic groups Sp(2) and
Sp(4) respectively, and that symplectic transformations consist of rotations
and squeeze transformations.

I. INTRODUCTION

We are quite familiar with rotations, but not with squeeze transformations. Yet, squeeze
transformations are everywhere in physics, including special relativity, classical mechanics,
and quantum mechanics. If we enlarge the group of rotations by including squeeze trans-
formations, it becomes a symplectic group. For this reason, most of the groups in physics
are symplectic groups or subgroups of the symplectic group, and quantum optics is not an
exception. We have squeezed states of light!

Let us ﬁrst look at the two two-mode states discussed in detail by Yurke, McCall and
Klauder [1]. One of the states is generated by the operators satisfying the commutation
relations for the SU(2) group, and the other state generated by those satisfying the SU(1, 1)
algebra or the algebra of the Sp(2) symplectic group [2,3]. If we combine these two states
by constructing a set of closed commutation relations starting from the generators of both

states, we end up with ten generators satisfying the commutation relations for the O(3, 2)
Lorentz group [3–5]. This O(3, 2)-like two-oscillator state was considered by Dirac in 1963 [6].
Although quantum optics has been the primary beneﬁciary of the symmetries exhibited
by two-photon states in recent years, we should note that squeezed states are not restricted to
optical sciences. It was noted that the O(3, 2) symmetry is relevant to Bogoliubov transfor-
mations in superconductivity [7]. There are now two-phonon coherent states [8,9] possessing
symmetry properties not observed in photon states. It is quite possible that they symmetries
derivable from the E(2)-like subgroups of the O(3, 2)-like two-oscillator system.

In Secs II, III, and IV we discuss how the O(3, 2) states are constructed from the SU(2)
and SU(1, 1) states, the E(2)-like little group of O(3, 2), and the E(2)-like sheared states,
respectively. Our discussion of the sheared state is largely based on the 1992 paper by Kim
and Yeh [10].

II. SQUEEZED STATES

It is a well-established tradition that coherent and squeezed states as well as their variants
are represented by three-parameter groups. The symmetry of coherent state is a represen-
tation of the three-parameter Heisenberg group.

The one-mode squeezed state is representation of the U(1, 1) group generated by

Indeed, these are the generators of the group Sp(4) which is locally isomorphic to the
(3 + 2)-dimensional deSitter group [5,6].

III. THREE-PARAMETER SUBGROUPS OF SP(4)

The group Sp(4) has many subgroups, and three-parameter subgroups are particularly
useful in studying two-mode squeezed states [1,5]. The most obvious subgroup is the SU(2)-
like group generated by J1, J2, and J3. Another subgroup frequently discussed in the litera-
ture is the SU(1, 1)-like group generated by Jo, K3, Q3. From the local isomorphism between
Sp(4) and O(3, 2), it is not diﬃcult to ﬁnd all possible SU(1, 1)-like subgroups.

Indeed, the above-mentioned SU(1, 1)-like subgroup is unitarily equivalent to those gen-
erated by Jo, K1, Q1 and by J0, K2, Q2. There is also an SU(1, 1)-like subgroup generated
by K1, K2, J3, which is unitarily equivalent to Q1, Q2, and J3. These are then unitarily
equivalent to the subgroups generated by K2, K3, J1, by K3, K1, J2, by Q2, Q3, J1, and by
Q3, Q1, J2. It is known from the Lorentz group that the signs of Ki and Qi can be changed.
It is
known that the O(3, 1) Lorentz group has a number of E(2)-like subgroups. Since there are
two O(3, 1)-like subgroups in the O(3, 2) deSitter group, the group Sp(4) should contain a
number of E(2)-like subgroups [12]. If we deﬁne

The purpose of this paper is to discuss additional three-parameter subgroups.

and

then the resulting commutation relations are

[F1, F2] = 0,

[J3, F1] =

iF2,

[J3, F2] = iF1,

−
and similar relations for G1, G2 and J3. This set of commutation relations is the same as
for the generators of the E(2) group. The subgroup generated by G1, G2 and J3 is unitarily
equivalent to that generated by F1, F2 and J3. There are four-additional subgroups generated
by F2, F3, J1, by F3, F1,J2, by G2, G3, J1, and by G3, G1, J2. They are all unitarily equivalent.
Thus we can study them all by studying one of them.

Let us deﬁne the word “shear.” In the xp plane, we can consider linear transformations

of the type

the p variable remains unchanged.

With this preparation, we continue our discussion of the E(2)-like subgroups discussed
introduced in Sec. IV. In the four-by-four matrix representation, the rotation generator J3

This is normal-ordered, but the shear operator ˆS(α, β) is not. However, there are theorems
in the literature which allow us to write the ˆS operator in a normal-ordered form [13].

ˆS(α, β) = λ : exp

The computation of these numbers in terms of the coeﬃcients given in Eq.(4.8) is possible.
On the other hand, it is not clear whether this computation will lead to a closed analytical
form for each of the above quantities. The method of Wigner function will make these
calculations relatively simple [3,10].

In this report, we have given only a sample calculation. We have not made any attempt
to derive the numbers which can be measured in laboratories. This can be done when there
are more concrete evidence for sheared states of photons or phonons [8,9].

Abstract

Optical levitation of a liquid droplet in gas phase was investigated under time-
dependent change of the gravitational acceleration with speciﬁc ﬂight pattern of
an airplane. Through multiple trials under linear increase of eﬀective gravitational
acceleration, we performed the experiment of optical trapping of a droplet from
0.3g0 to 0.9g0, where g0 = 9.8 m/s2. During such change of the eﬀective gravitational
acceleration, the trapping position on a droplet with the radius of 14 µm was found
to be lowered by ca. 100 µm. The essential feature of the change of the trapping
position is reproduced by a theoretical calculation under the framework of ray optics.
As far as we know, the present study is the ﬁrst report on optical levitation under
time-dependent gravitational change.

1 Introduction

Since the pioneering study of Ashkin on optical manipulation, trapping by
focused laser has been actively studied. It has been shown that laser trapping
serves as a useful experimental tool on the manipulation of micro systems in

liquid solutions. In contrast to active studies on the optical trapping in liquid
phase, only a few studies on optical levitation in gas phase have been reported
(see ref.[1] and the references in ref.[2]). Optical injection can generate at most
only 10 nN as theoretical limit when the power of light is 1 W[3]. Thus, in the
case of ground-based experiments, the size of levitation object is limited upto
the order of tens of µm.

As for the levitation in gas phase beside optical trapping, several methodolo-
gies have been examined such as electrostatics[4], electromagnetics[5], aerodynamics[6],
and ultrasonics[?]. With these methods it is still diﬃcult to trap and manipu-
late a desired single object. Thus, it may be of scientiﬁc value to perform the
experiment of optical levitation in gas phase toward the optimization of the
eﬃciency as well as the improvement of the performance.

We have reported optical trapping of a water droplet with the radius of µm
by using highly converged laser in gas phase on the ground[2]. In the present
study, we adapt the low converged laser in order to obtain large working
distance. We will report the result of optical levitation under time dependent
change of eﬀective gravitational acceleration with a speciﬁc designed ﬂight of
an airplane. This study carried out in toward the future application for the
experiments under microgravity in the International Space Station (ISS).

2 Experimental

We performed the trapping experiments in a jet airplane (Mitsubishi MU-300,
operated by Diamond Air Service Co., Aichi, Japan). The ﬂight pattern was
selected so as to change the acceleration of the airplane along vertical axis
d2H/dt2 linearly as shown in Fig.1. It is to be noted that such a change of the
gravitational acceleration is largely diﬀerent from the conventional parabolic
ﬂight (see the broken line in the Fig.1) usually adapted for the experiment of
“microgravity”.

Experimental setup is schematically illustrated in Fig.2. In order to improve
the dispersibility of droplets, aqueous solution containing 30 vol% of ethanol
was used. The droplets were injected into glass cell (10 mm × 10 mm × 50 mm)
with an atomizer during eﬀective gravitational acceleration in the airplane g
(= d2H/dt2 + g0, where the gravitational acceleration on the ground g0 =
9.8 m/s2) was 0.01g0 (e.g. between 0 and 20 s in Fig.1). For optical levita-
tion, slightly converged continuous wave laser beam (wavelength λ = 532 nm,
TEM00 mode, Millennia, Spectra Physics) at 150 mW was focused from the
beneath into the cell with achromatic lens. The convergence angle was 5 de-
grees. The time course on the manner of optical trapping of droplets was
monitored with a CCD camera. The experiments are carried out at ca. 298 K.

3 Results and Discussion

Fig.3 shows the result of optical levitation on a droplet, where the time t = 0
and position z = 0 are taken at the moment at which the droplet is begun
to be trapped. Without laser irradiation, these droplets tended to fall down
and the rate of the downward motion was increased with the increase of the
eﬀective gravitational acceleration g. With laser irradiation from the beneath,
under microgravity condition, droplets on the optical corn were scattered to
the laser direction. When g = 0.3g0, a droplet was spontaneously trapped. As
in the ﬁgure, the trapping position was gradually lowered accompanied with

the time development which is correlated with the increase of g. The spatio-
temporal image indicates the gradual change of the trapping position, where
many other ﬂoating droplets outside the trapping position were continuously
falling down.

Fig.4(a) shows the change of the trapping position, z, with the change of the
eﬀective gravitational acceleration, where z changes gradually until t = ca.
4.5 s. Then, the droplet tends to fall down, which is attributed to the escape
from the trapping potential due to the increase of g. Open circles in Fig.4(b)
shows the correlation between z and the relative value g/g0.

In the present experiment, it was diﬃcult to estimate the actual size of the
trapped droplet from the image itself, because of the low magniﬁcation of
the objective lens on the CCD camera. Thus, we will have the discussion to
evaluate the size of the trapped droplet from the experimental observation on
the change of the trapping position depending on the change of the eﬀective
gravitational acceleration. The motion equation of the droplet is:

m¨z = Fg + Fl + Fv

the inertial force m¨z (m: mass of a droplet), the gravitational force Fg, the
force induced by converged laser Fl along the optical axis and the viscous force
Fv. Since the radius of the trapped droplet is on the order of 10 µm, we can
assume the viscous limit: m¨z ∼= Fv, and obtain the relation:

Experimental and theoretical results are given as open circles and solid line, respec-
tively. The broken line is the expected curve from a theoretical consideration. In the
theoretical calculation, following parameters are adapted: laser power P = 150 mW,
convergence angle φ = 7.0 degrees, injected ratio of laser to the lens σ/L = 1.5,
droplet radius r = 14.0 µm, refractive index of a medium n1 = 1.00, refractive in-
dex of a droplet n2 = 1.35, density of a droplet ρ = 9.65 × 102 kg/m3, gravitational
acceleration on the ground g0= 9.80 m/s2. (c) Schematic illustration of the relation-
ship between the droplet’s motion and the shift of potential minimum. The broken

gravitational contribution: The solid arrow shows the shift of potential minimum

where g: eﬀective gravitational acceleration and ρ: density of a droplet. Addi-
tionally, the radius r of the droplet is enough larger than the wave length λ.
So we can use the ray optics regime in calculating Fl,

Fl = Fl(r, z; P, φ,

, n1, n2)

σ
L

where r: radius of a droplet, z: distance between focal point of laser and the
center of a droplet, P : laser power, φ: convergence angle of laser, σ/L: injected
ratio of TEM00 mode laser to the lens (σ is deviation of TEM00 mode laser
and L is lens radius), n1: refractive index of a medium, n2: refractive index of
a droplet, Qz: trapping eﬃciency along optical axis, and c: velocity of light,
respectively. In this case, r and z are variable, and the other parameters are
ﬁxed.

Fl is found as follows. In the framework of the ray optics, a TEM00 mode laser
can be divided to rays which are suﬃxed with i and each power n1Pi/c is
related to σ/L. Each rays hit the surface of the droplet at diﬀerent incident
angles φi (0 ≤ φi ≤ φ), repeat reﬂections and transmissions in the droplet
until the intensity of rays reduce to zero of limit, and give the momentum
with a certain eﬃciency along z-axis, Qi = Qi(r, z; φi, n1, n2):

where θi: incident angle, ri: refractive angle, Ri: reﬂection coeﬃcient and Ti:
transmission coeﬃcient. These parameters are obtained by considering geo-
metric relation between the droplet and the direction of a beam (see ref.[7]).
Now, assuming the spherical droplet with radius r, whose center is located
at distance z from the focal point of the laser, we calculate the details of
reﬂections and transmissions concerning all the paths of laser beam.

By changing the radius r in the above equations, we have tried to ﬁnd the
optimal curve to ﬁt the experimental observation. Fig.4(b) shows the change
of the trapping position, i.e., minimum on the potential, together with the
experimental result on the height z of the trapped droplet with respect to
the relative value g/g0. From this result, we can qualitatively understand the
motion of the trapped droplet as the shift of the potential minimum point (see
Fig.4(c)).

From the above analysis, it has become clear that the essential feature of the
optical levitation has been theoretically reproduced in a satisfactory manner.
Using eq.(7) at the critical value at g = 1.0g0 to levitate the droplet which is
found by experimental result, we obtain maximum trapping eﬃciency along
optical axis Qz as 0.22. It is noted that this eﬃciency is one order of magnitude
greater than those in previous reports (see the table 1 of ref.[2]), except to our
recent result on the ground[2]. Since the water droplet was atomized in the
microgravity condition in this experiment, the inertia of the droplet was small
and reduced by viscous drag. Additionally, the viscous limit was accomplished
by slowly changing the gravitional acceleration. We could, thus, evaluate the
critical value of the gravitational acceleration on the optidal levitation.

In the present study we have adapted the small converged laser, indicating the
experimental condition with rather large working distance on the order of cm.
The combination of the small converged laser and microgravity condition may
aﬀord interesting experimental system on the optical levitation. We have a
plan to improve the experimental system by using multiple laser sources with
small converged laser.

4 Conclusion

We investigated the change of the trapping position of a droplet under time-
dependent change of the gravitational acceleration. It was shown that the-
oretical calculation based on ray optics reproduced the experimental trend.
The present result may contribute in designing the manipulating system on
the International Space Station (ISS), including the experiments of protein
crystal growth[?] and water droplet growth[2].

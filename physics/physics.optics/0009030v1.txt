Abstract

A theory of evanescent mode atomic mirrors utilising a metallic sheet on a dielectric

substrate is described. The emphasis here is on the role of the metallic sheet and on

the evaluation of atomic trajectories using the ﬁeld-dipole orientation picture. At low

intensity, the atomic reﬂection process is controlled by two separate mechanisms both

of which are modiﬁed by the presence of the metallic sheet and inﬂuenced by the use of

the ﬁeld-dipole orientation picture. The ﬁrst mechanism involves the spontaneous force

which accelerates the atom parallel to the sheet plane. The second mechanism involves

the combined dipole plus van der Waals force which acts to repel the atom from the

surface, decelerating its motion until it attains an instantaneous halt before changing

direction away from the surface at an appropriate turning point in the trajectory.

Various quantitative features arising from varying the controllable parameters of the

system, including screening eﬀects as well as desirable enhancement eﬀects, are pointed

out and discussed.

One of the primary aims, yet to be fully accomplished in the rapidly developing ﬁeld

of atom optics is the standardisation of the atomic mirror as a routine atom optical

element. The idea of an atomic mirror, a device capable of reﬂecting atoms, was

ﬁrst put forward by Cooke and Hill in 1982 [1]. Since then, a number of studies,

both theoretical and experimental, have sought to explore various aspects of atomic

mirrors, based on diﬀerent mechanisms of atom reﬂection from planar surfaces [2-19]. In

particular, the evanescent mode atomic mirror is suitable for neutral atoms undergoing

electric dipole transitions [14,18,19]. The mechanism in this type of mirror makes use

of light evanescing into the vacuum region outside the planar surface of a dielectric

when laser light is internally reﬂected. The evanescent light sets up a repulsive dipole

potential which acts on any neutral atom possessing a transition frequency at near

resonance with, and blue-detuned from, the laser frequency. The limiting factors of

such a mirror stem primarily from heating eﬀects and also from ﬂuctuations due to the

light which become negligible at low intensities. A device operating at low intensities

was thus needed. This was the motivation behind the studies which highlight the role

of a thin metallic layer deposited on the surface in providing an enhancement of the

evanescent component [18,19].

The purpose of this article is to report a theory of evanescent mode atomic mirrors

with a metallic sheet, exploring the nature of the enhancement, determining the general

features of the mirror and evaluating the trajectories for a typical set of parameters.

It turns out that a quantitative theoretical analysis demands the implementation of a

number of steps. First, a mode normalisation procedure in terms of intensity is needed

for the incident light mode responsible for the generation of the evanescent component.

Secondly, the jump conditions should be implemented involving the surface current

arising from the ﬁnite two-dimensional conductivity of the metallic sheet. Thirdly, the

attractive force between the atom and the dielectric in the presence of the metallic

sheet should be included in the dynamics to determine the trajectories. Finally, use

2

should made of the ﬁeld-dipole orientation picture for evaluating the radiation forces

as well as the van der Waals-type atom-surface force. The role of the ﬁeld-dipole

orientation picture is to determine an average value for the local orientation of the

electric dipole moment vector in the presence of the evanescent ﬁeld. We show here

that a programme incorporating the above theoretical features permits the atomic

trajectories to be determined by direct solution of the equation of motion, leading either

to a reﬂection of the atom oﬀ the mirror or a collision with it, in a manner dependent

on the chosen set of parameters. Existing treatments determining trajectories are

primarily based on Monte Carlo techniques.

The basic elements comprising the atomic mirror are shown schematically in Fig. 1.

Here a metallic sheet in the form of an inﬁnitesimally thin layer is deposited on the

planar surface of a dielectric substrate (or glass prism). Light of frequency ω incident

from within the dielectric is internally reﬂected at the interface between the dielectric

substrate and the metallic sheet. This creates a ﬁeld in the vacuum region which is

decaying with distance from the metallic sheet and is propagating along the surface.

A neutral atom possessing a transition frequency ω0 < ω and which is moving in

the plane of incidence would be subject to the repulsive dipole force plus an attractive

atom-surface force and will also experience a light pressure force parallel to the surface.

As we show below the combined inﬂuence of these forces can be made to control the

reﬂection process.

The relevant electric ﬁeld vector at frequency ω can be written in terms of incident (I),

reﬂected (R) and evanescent (1) parts as follows

E(, r, t) = n(cid:16)EI(kk, r, t) + ER(kk, r, t)(cid:17) θ(−z) + E1(kk, r, t)θ(z)o a + h.c.

where θ is the unit step function and the ﬁelds are given by

EI(kk, r, t) = AI  1, 0, −

kk

kz2! e−ikz2zei(kk.rk−ωt)
kz1! e−kz1zei(kk.rk−ωt)

ikk

(3)

(4)

Here kk is the wavevector parallel to the surface. Its magnitude kk is given by c2k2

k =

ω2ǫ2 sin2 φ where φ is the angle of incidence. The three quantities between the brackets

in each of Eqs.(2) to (4) stand for the vector components parallel to kk, perpendicular

to it on the surface plane and along the z-direction, respectively. kz1 and kz2 (both

real) are deﬁned by

k2
z1 = k2

k −

ǫ1ω2
c2 > 0;

k2
z2 =

ǫ2ω2
c2 − k2

k > 0

(5)

Finally, AI, AR and B are ﬁeld amplitude factors, to be determined. The notation

is such that parameters associated with the substrate are labelled by the subscript

2, while for the outer region (vacuum) the label is 1. Both dielectric functions ǫ1

and ǫ2 are assumed to be frequency-independent and we take ǫ1 = 1, as appropriate

for vacuum. The position vector is written as r = (rk, z) in terms of an in-plane

position vector rk and a z-coordinate relative to the metallic sheet. The role of the

metallic sheet is primarily to provide a two-dimensional charge density ns and, so, an

electrical conductivity inse2/m∗(ω + iγ) where m∗ and e are the electronic eﬀective

mass and charge and γ ≪ ω accounts for metallic plasma loss eﬀects. The metallic

sheet only enters the formalism via the electromagnetic boundary conditions involving

the tangential components of the magnetic ﬁelds corresponding to Eqs.(2) to (4), which

can be calculated using Maxwell’s equation H = −(iǫ0c2/ω)∇× E. Application of the

ﬁrst boundary condition, namely the continuity of the tangential component of the

electric ﬁeld vector at z = 0, yields

AI + AR = B

(6)

The second electromagnetic boundary condition is that the tangential component of

the magnetic ﬁeld vector experiences a discontinuity at z = 0 arising from the surface

4

current induced by the in-plane component of the electric ﬁeld at the metallic sheet.

We have

Hk(0−) − Hk(0+) =

where 0± are the limits as ξ → 0 of (0 ± ξ). Application of this boundary condition

leads to a second relation connecting the ﬁeld amplitudes

The next step is to determine the value for the amplitude AI. This is the amplitude

The average radiation force acting on an atom of transition frequency ω0 moving in

the vacuum region at velocity v is given by the well known expression [20,22]

F (r, v) = 2¯h(ΓΩ2

Rkk − 1
∆2 + 2Ω2

2∆∇Ω2
R + Γ2 ) = Fs + Fd

R

(12)

where Fs corresponds to the ﬁrst term, identiﬁed as the spontaneous force along the

wave propagation direction kk, and Fd corresponds to the second term, identiﬁed as

the dipole force; ∆ is the dynamic detuning given by

∆ = ∆0 − kk.v

(13)

with ∆0 = ω − ω0 the static detuning of the light from the atomic resonance. The

force given in Eq.(12) is applicable in the low intensity limit for which the saturation

5

parameter S satisﬁes the inequality S = 2Ω2

R/(∆2 + Γ2) < 1, where ΩR(0) is the Rabi

frequency, deﬁned below, evaluated at z = 0, and Γ is the spontaneous emission rate.

At the high intensity regime, corresponding to S >> 1 one needs to adopt the dressed

atom approach [21]. The low intensity regime is the correct regime in the context of

the atomic mirrors considered here for which it can readily be veriﬁed that S < 1, so

that the dynamics based on the average radiation forces given by Eq.(12) is applicable.

Of the two average radiation forces, it is easy to see that Fd can act as a repulsive force

provided that the detuning ∆0 is positive (blue detuning). Note that v, the velocity

of the atom, is in the plane of incidence as in Fig. 1, i.e. has only two components, a

z-component and a component parallel to kk. The Rabi frequency ΩR entering Eq.(12)

is deﬁned for the electric dipole µ in the evanescent ﬁeld E1(kk, r, t)

(14)

ΩR = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where α is a complex amplitude factor such that a → α in the classical electromagnetic

ﬁeld limit. It is in fact related to the intensity I of the incident beam by the well known

relation [23]

|α|2 =

¯hcω

(15)

It can be seen from Eq.(4) that the evanescent ﬁeld possesses two vector components.

However, once the evanescent ﬁeld has been set up, the average atomic dipole moment

vector at any given point aligns itself along, and follows the oscillations of, the local

evanescent electric ﬁeld vector. The appropriate Rabi frequency in this ﬁeld-dipole

orientation picture is thus given by [22]

¯hΩR(r) = |α| µE1(r)

(16)

where µ and E1 are the magnitudes of these vectors. Using Eqs.(4) and (9) we can

write the square of the Rabi frequency in the limit γ → 0 in the following form,

emphasising the dependence on the angle of incidence φ, which is related to kk through

with d a convenient scaling length. Note the presence of the second term in the ex-

pression between the last pair of brackets in Eq.(17) which is proportional to k2

k/k2
z1.

This represents the contribution from the z-component of E1, and since kz1 can be

very small (when the angle of incidence is close to the total internal reﬂection angle),

this could lead to an enhancement, in contrast to the contribution from the in-plane

component (corresponding to the ﬁrst term in the last pair of bracket in Eq.(17)) which

does not exhibit this feature.

Figure 2 displays the eﬀects of varying the sheet electron density ns on the value of the

squared Rabi frequency Ω2

R(ω, φ, 0), i.e. evaluated at the surface z = 0. This quantity

provides an indication of the eﬀectiveness of the structure as an atomic mirror. The

curves correspond to diﬀerent values of angle of incidence φ. There are two features

worthy of note here. First, for a given φ the variation of Ω2

R with increasing ns is

practically ﬂat at the value corresponding to ns = 0 (absence of the metallic sheet)

up to a point where it changes rapidly, increasing to a maximum and then dropping

sharply to a relatively small value at a higher range of ns. This feature at large ns

signiﬁes screening eﬀects. The peak of Ω2

R corresponds to the value of ns satisfying

the condition kz1d = ω2/Λ2, which is similar to (but not the same as) the dispersion

relation of the surface mode in this system which is [24-26]

This surface mode, in turn, diﬀers from the usual surface plasmon mode arising on a

semi-inﬁnite metallic half space. At an angle of incidence approximately equal to φ0 for

7

total internal reﬂection, the Rabi frequency exhibits a resonance which is at least two

orders of magnitude larger than the value corresponding to the absence of the metallic

sheet. At φ = φ0 (not shown in the Fig. 2) the squared Rabi frequency Ω2

R would be

in the form of a delta function. In principle, then, pronounced repulsion eﬀects would

be expected in conditions corresponding to the region of the resonance.

The real mirror action is only partially inﬂuenced by the behaviour of the Rabi fre-

quency; dynamical eﬀects are, of course, controlled by the forces acting on the atomic

centre of mass. The atom experiences besides the average radiation force given by

Eq.(12), an attractive force due to interaction with the vacuum ﬁelds which are con-

strained by the presence of the surface. At distances from the surface large compared to

a reduced transition wavelength λ0/2π the atom-surface force takes the Casimir-Polder

form. At distances smaller than λ0/2π the force assumes the van der Waals form. As

we show shortly, the important region for the atomic mirrors considered here, is, in

fact, the van der Waals regime for which the force can be written as

Fvw(z) = −

∂Uvw

∂z

(20)

where Uvw is the image potential. As is well known, the van der Waals potential arises

as the position-dependent change in the radiative self energy due to the presence of

the surface, but it depends on the orientation of the electric dipole moment relative

to the surface. It should be emphasised that the evanescent ﬁeld has no other role to

play in the determination of the van der Waals potential, except that it is responsible

for the dipole orientation. The average electric dipole aligns itself parallel to ˆe1, a unit

vector in the direction of the local evanescent electric ﬁeld so that E1(r) = ˆe1E1(r). In

the ﬁeld-dipole orientation picture this state of aﬀairs applies at every point along the

atom trajectory. The leading contribution to the van der Waals potential arises from

the interaction of the electric dipole with its image and we therefore have

Uvw(z) = −

µ2

32πǫ0z3 n3(ˆe1.ˆz)(˜ˆe1.ˆz) − ˆe1 ˜.ˆe1o

(21)

where the unit vector ˜ˆe1 is the image of ˆe1.

The atomic reﬂection process is controlled by two separate mechanisms. Firstly, the

spontaneous force Fs acts on the atom in the direction of kk and, secondly, the combined

force Fd +Fvw acts to repel the atom from the surface, decelerating its motion along the

z-axis towards the surface, attaining an instantaneous halt before changing direction

away from the surface at an appropriate turning point in the trajectory. This behaviour

can be seen more clearly by examining the corresponding repulsive potential UT (v, z) =

Uvw(z) + Ud(v, z) which is shown in Fig. 3 for a typical set of parameters. Note that by

controlling the average dipole direction the ﬁeld-dipole orientation picture inﬂuences

the variations of both Uvw and Ud.

The trajectory of the atom of mass M approaching a mirror for a given set up is

obtainable by solving the equation of motion

M

d2r
dt2 = Fs + Fd + Fvw − Mgˆz

(22)

subject to given initial conditions. Figure 4 displays typical trajectories in the plane

of incidence. The parameters are such that the spontaneous rate Γ is taken to be the

free space value Γ0. This is in fact a very good approximation in the trajectory region

which is suﬃciently far from the metallic sheet and the substrate. The static detuning

is taken to be ∆0 = 5 × 102Γ0. Finally the intensity of the light is assumed to be

I = 2.0 × 104W m−2. It is straightforward to verify that for this light intensity and for

the detuning value used here, the saturation parameter S = 2Ω2

R(0)/(∆2 + Γ2

0) ≈ 0.23

which conforms with the low intensity regime.

In view of Fig. 4 one concludes that the structure operates as an atomic mirror in three

of the cases displayed, while for the fourth case the trajectory of the atom terminates

with a collision at the surface. An approximate guide to the condition leading to a

collision with the surface is to compare the maximum height Umax of the potential

in Fig. 3 to the initial kinetic energy Mv2

z (0)/2. For vz(0) > q2Umax/M a collision

9

occurs. This interpretation indeed conforms with the results of the type shown in Fig.

3. Note that reﬂected atom trajectories are, in general, asymmetric with respect to the

turning point. This is a consequence of the action of Fs which in the present example

where the light and the atom are incident on the same side (left side) of the z-axis,

accelerates the atom to the right along the surface.

In conclusion, we have explored the inﬂuence of adding a metallic sheet to the usual

evanescent mode atomic mirror set up. The theory presented provides information

about the range of metallic sheet densities and the angle of incidence at which the

Rabi frequency exhibits pronounced enhancement eﬀects. We have also adopted the

ﬁeld-dipole orientation picture in which the average atomic dipole oscillates along the

direction of the electric ﬁeld of the evanescent mode at every point in the trajectory. We

have seen that this step which allowed us to identify the direction of the average dipole

moment vector as that of the local electric ﬁeld vector at every point in the trajectory,

has important consequences for the evaluation of the forces and, hence, the dynamics

of the atom. Our results show that enhancement arises at an angle of incidence close

to that of the total internal reﬂection condition, but requires a relatively high sheet

density.

Figure 1

Schematic arrangement of the elements comprising an evanescent mode atomic mirror

with a metallic sheet. The plane of incidence contains the internally reﬂected light

beam as well as a typical atomic trajectory. Here both the atom and the light are

initially propagating on the same side of the vertical (z-axis).

incidence φ = 42.00o (dashes); φ = 47.00o (dash-dots); φ = 52.00o (dash-double dots).

The inset (solid curve) shows the variation for φ = 41.37o, which is very close to

the angle φ0 for total internal reﬂection. The parameters are such that ǫ2 = 2.298,

corresponding to an angle of total internal reﬂection φ0 = 41.27o; Γ0 = 6.128 × 106 s−1;

∆0 = 5.0 × 102Γ0 and the intensity of the light is taken as I = 2.0 × 104Wm−2 for the

Rb resonance at the transition wavelength λ0 = 780nm. The scaling length d is taken

as d = 15 nm.

Figure 3

Variation with z (in units of d = 15nm) of the combined static dipole potential U =

, but diﬀerent values of angle of incidence φ. They are as follows:

φ = 42.00o (dashes); φ = 45.00o (dash-dots); φ = 47.00o (dash-double dots); φ = 41.37o

(solid curve). The dotted curve shows the variation of the van der Waals potential. In

13

the evaluation of the potentials, the direction of the dipole moment vector conforms

with the ﬁeld-dipole orientation picture. The parameters are the same as those used

in the evaluation of Fig. 2.

Figure 4

Atomic trajectories of a Rb atom in the atomic mirror arrangement shown in Fig.1 with

the x-z plane as the plane of incidence. The angle of incidence is ﬁxed at φ = 42.000 and

the metallic sheet corresponds to ns = 215nsilver

s

, as in Fig. 3. In all cases the initial

position of the atom is at the point (x = 0, z = 100d), where d = 15nm. The diﬀerent

trajectories correspond to the same initial condition for the horizontal component of

the velocity vk(0) = 0.054 ms−1, but diﬀer in their initial z-component of velocity vz(0).

They are as follows: vz(0) = 0.1ms−1 (solid curve); vz(0) = 0.4ms−1 (dashed curve);

vz(0) = 0.7ms−1 (dash-dotted curve); vz(0) = 1.1ms−1 (dash-double dotted curve).

The parameters are the same as those in Figs. 2 and 3.

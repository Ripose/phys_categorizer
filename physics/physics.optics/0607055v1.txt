Low Distortion Slow Light using Two Absorption Resonances

We consider group delay and broadening using two strongly absorbing and widely spaced reso-
nances. We derive relations which show that very large pulse bandwidths coupled with large group
delays and small broadening can be achieved. Unlike single resonance systems the dispersive broad-
ening dominates the absorptive broadening which leads to a dramatic increase in the possible group
delay. We show that the double resonance systems are excellent candidates for realizing all-optical
delay lines. We report on an experiment which achieved up to 50 pulse delays with 40% broadening.

A variety of applications in telecommunications and
quantum information have been driving recent interest
in slow group velocities of light pulses. Among these ap-
plications are continuously tunable delay lines, all-optical
buﬀers [1], optical pattern correlation, ultra-strong cross-
phase modulation [2],
low light level nonlinear optics
[3, 4, 5], and numerous others. The means for ob-
taining ultra-slow group velocities have usually involved
a Lorentzian transparency or gain resonance: electro-
magnetically induced transparency (EIT) [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
coherent population oscillations (CPO) [11, 12, 13], stim-
ulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) [14, 15, 16], stimulated
Raman scattering (SRS) [17, 18] etc..

In this paper we discuss delaying pulses whose cen-
ter frequency lies between two strongly absorbing res-
onances. Many researchers have considered using gain
doublets in the context of pulse advancement [19, 20, 21,
22, 23], and Macke and Segard [22] have discussed pulse
advancements for absorptive doublets. Grischkowsky [24]
measured the delay of a pulse between two Zeeman-
shifted absorbing resonances, and Tanaka et al. [25] per-
formed initial measurements of the delay of a pulse be-
tween two atomic hyperﬁne resonances. This work con-
siders both delay and broadening with an emphasis on
the suitability of the delay and broadening characteris-
tics for practical applications.

In the context of optical delay lines, several criteria
must be satisﬁed for slow light to be useful. First, the
slowed light pulses must meet system bandwidth speci-
ﬁcations. Second, the delay-bandwidth product must be
much larger than unity. Third, the delay re-conﬁguration
rate should be faster than the inverse pulse propaga-
tion time through the medium. Fourth, pulse absorption
must be kept to a minimum. Fifth, the pulse broaden-
ing should also be minimal. The exact requirements for
practical optical buﬀers are application dependant. A
typical system operating at 10 Gb/sec with return-to-
zero coding and a 50 % duty cycle might require 7.5 GHz
signal bandwidth, a delay bandwidth product of 1000, a
re-conﬁguration rate in excess of 7.5 MHz with less than
90% absorption and pulse broadening of less than 2.

Despite widespread interest in large pulse delays, si-
multaneously satisfying all ﬁve criteria for most applica-
tions has proven diﬃcult.
In this paper we show that
double Lorentzian systems manages four of these criteria

well:
large bandwidth, large delay bandwidth product,
minimal absorption and minimal dispersion. Although
we have not realized fast reconﬁguration rates, there are
a number of proposals which suggest that fast reconﬁgu-
ration rates using double Lorentzians may be possible.
In single and double Lorentzian systems, there exists
a tradeoﬀ between large delay-bandwidth products and
pulse broadening. We show that double Lorentzians in
contrast to single Lorentzians have interesting proper-
ties which help minimize this tradeoﬀ while preserving
all other criteria.

Consider two absorbing Lorentzian lines of equal width
separated by a spectral distance much larger than their
widths. Following the the single Lorentzian formalism of
Ref.
[26], the susceptibility of the double Lorentzian is
given by

ω1 − ω − iγ

where β is the strength of the susceptibility and 2γ is
the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM). Making the
change of variables ω = (ω1 + ω2)/2 + δ and ω0 =
(ω2 − ω1)/2 and assuming the far detuned limit (i.e.
ω0 ≫ γ), we may neglect the half-width term in the
denominator. We further assume the pulse frequencies
to lie within the range |δ| ≪ ω0, the pulse bandwidth to
be larger than the Lorentzian half-width,γ, and χ ≪ 1.
The real and imaginary parts of the refractive index
n = n′ + in′′ ≈ 1 + χ/2 may then be written as

The dispersive and absorptive broadenings in the
small-pulse-bandwidth limit (i.e., pulse bandwidth is
much smaller
than the spectral distance between
Lorentzians) are dominated by the second terms in the
power series expansions of the real and imaginary parts
respectively. The absorptive broadening is due to the
spectrally dependent absorption in the wings of the pulse
spectrum.
In the small-pulse-bandwidth limit the ab-
sorption can be approximated by a Gaussian shaped
spectral ﬁlter plus a constant absorption:

S(δ) = exp[−α(δ)L] ≈ exp[−αmL − 3δ2αmL/ω2
0]

(6)

When the input pulse is a bandwidth-limited Gaussian,
we ﬁnd that in the frequency domain the output pulse
is the product of the spectral ﬁlter and the input pulse
spectrum Ain(δ):

Aout(δ) = Ain(δ)S(δ)

pulse. Thus, accounting for only absorptive broadening
the temporal half-width after traversing the medium is

The temporal broadening due to dispersion is approxi-
mated by taking the diﬀerence in group delay for a pulse
centered at δ = 0 and a pulse centered at 1/T0. The
temporal half-width due to dispersion is

We focus on the case where ω0 ≫ 1/T0 ≫ γ and
Ta/T0 ≤ 2, corresponding to our experimental param-
eters. For this case the dispersive broadening dominates

through a heated rubidium vapor cell and is either measur-
ing directly using a fast detector, or after interference on a
balanced photoreceiver.

(i.e. the second term on the right hand side of eq. 8 con-
tributes most to the broadening). However, the quadratic
absorption is still signiﬁcant since it reduces the eﬀects of
dispersive broadening by most strongly absorbing those
frequencies which experience the largest dispersion (i.e.
frequency wings of the pulse). For the parameters con-
sidered in this paper, pulse broadening is less with both
absorptive and dispersive broadening included than for
dispersive broadening alone.
In single Lorentzian sys-
tems, absorption is the dominant broadening mechanism
and this relationship between broadening mechanisms is
not signiﬁcant.

Although in hot Rb vapor the resonances experience
strong inhomogeneous Doppler broadening, in the far-
wing limit the Rb resonances are essentially Lorentzian
and the double Lorentzian formalism is a very good ap-
proximation. The Rb 85 D2 hyperﬁne resonances are sep-
arated by approximately 3 GHz, so the gaussian Doppler
broadening of approximately 500 MHz has little eﬀect on
the absorptive behavior. Also, collisional broadening was
not signiﬁcant for the temperatures used in this work.

A diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Fig.
1. A narrowband (300 kHz) diode laser at 780 nm gen-
erates a beam of light tuned halfway between the Rb 85
D2 hyperﬁne resonances, which is ﬁber coupled into a fast
electro-optic modulator (EOM). An arbitrary waveform
generator (AWG) drives the EOM, producing light pulses
with a duration of approximately 2 ns FWHM. The light
pulses then pass through a 10 cm glass cell containing ru-
bidium in natural isotopic abundance. The cell is heated
with electronic strip heaters and enclosed in a cylindri-
cal oven with anti-reﬂection coated windows. The pulse
is then incident upon a 1 GHz avalanche photo-diode
(APD) and recorded on a 1.5 GHz oscilloscope triggered
by the AWG.

A Mach-Zehnder interferometer was also used with a
balanced photoreciever in order to make continuous wave
(CW) measurements of the transmission and phase delay
as a function of frequency. The diﬀerence signal from the
balanced photoreciever provides phase information while

fringe corresponding to a 2π phase shift. The height of the
fringes is in arbitrary units. Both transmission and phase
data were taken with a 10 cm Rb vapor cell at approximately
130 C (corresponds to a group delay of 26 ns)

FIG. 3: Pulse delay at various optical depths. On the left,
2.4 ns pulses are passed through a 10 cm vapor cell and the
delay is tuned by changing temperature. On the right, a 2.1
ns pulse is passed through four 10 cm cells and delayed 106
ns (50 fractional pulse delays).

transmission data is obtained by blocking one of the pho-
toreciever photodiodes. The beam splitter preceding the
vapor cell is polarizing to allow for easy balancing of the
interferometer arms, and the beam splitter immediately
following the vapor cell is polarizing to allow switching
between the fast APD and CW balanced detection.

Figure 2 shows (a) absorption and (b) phase spec-
troscopy scans for the transmission window resulting in
a measured 26 ns pulse delay. The transmission window
has a width of approximately 1 GHz which is suﬃcient
acceptance bandwidth for the 2 ns pulses used in this
experiment. The interference fringes were obtained by
sweeping the laser frequency and monitoring the inten-
sity diﬀerence at the two output ports of a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer (see Fig. 1).

It is straightforward to predict the group delay from
the absorption scan or measure it directly using the in-
terference fringes. From the absorption data, we may
extract the optical depth and calculate the group delay
via Eq. 5, giving approximately 26 ns for absorption data
in Fig. 2a, in good agreement with the measured delay.
In contrast, from the interference fringes we may extract
the group delay directly:

where ∆N is the number of fringes in a frequency range
∆f . For the resonance shown in Fig. 2b there are ap-
proximately 25 fringes per GHz, giving a predicted op-
tical delay of 25/1GHz =25 ns, also in good agreement
with measured values. We note that the maximum delay-
bandwidth product of a dispersive medium is approxi-
mately given by the maximum number of interference
fringes that can be obtained within the acceptance band-
width.

Figure 3 shows probe pulse transmission and delay
for various cell temperatures, plotted in units of percent
transmission. Using a 2.4 ns long pulse (FWHM) and a
single 10 cm vapor cell and varying the temperature be-
tween 90 C and 140 C we were able to tune between 8 ns
and 36 ns of delay. We note that several pulse delays are
obtainable with greater than 1/e peak transmission. In
order to achieve 106 ns of delay with a delay-bandwidth
product of 50 and a broadening of approximately 40%
we used a 2.1 ns (FWHM) pulse incident on a series of
four 10 cm vapor cells all heated to approximately 130 C.
The theoretical prediction of transmission as a function
of group delay (Eq. 5) is also plotted using the Rb D2 ho-
mogeneous linewidth 2γ = 2π × 6.07 MHz from [27]. The
discrepancy between the measured pulse intensities and
the theoretical pulse energies can largely be attributed to
pulse broadening spreading the pulse energy over a larger
time resulting in lower peak intensities.

Figure 4 compares the fractional broadening of the de-
layed pulses shown in Fig. 3 to the predicted values cal-
culated using Eqs. 7-9. Shown in Fig. 4 are the measured
broadening values, the predicted total broadening with-
out absorptive corrections,(Ta + Td − T0)/T0, the total
predicted broadening, (Ttot − T0)/T0 and the total pre-
dicted broadening with a chirp-like like correction. As
predicted by Eq. 9, the data show that the quadratic
absorption decreases the broadening due to dispersion.
Also, for small optical depths the pulse width compresses
before broadening, which may be modeled by assuming a
small negative chirp on the input pulse. We do not know
the origins of the chirp, but we found that by including
a small second order chirp in the theory we obtained a
very good ﬁt to the data.

In conclusion, we have discussed the delay and broad-
ening characteristics for pulses propagating through

4

a double-Lorentzian medium (i.e.
a medium with
two widely spaced absorbing Lorentzian resonances).
For many slow-light applications, absorptive double
Lorentzian systems seem to be better suited than gain-
like single Lorentzian systems. Since the spacing between
the two Lorentzians can be arbitrarily large, the usable
bandwidth may be proportionately large, though practi-
cal considerations may limit the separation. Also, in con-
trast to single Lorenztians, the double-Lorentzian line-
shape is dominated by dispersive broadening and not ab-
sorptive broadening, resulting in less pulse distortion for
a given delay. While the method of tuning the delay in
the present experiment was slow (increasing the temper-
ature of the vapor cell), there may be ways to to achieve
fast reconﬁguration rates. Some possibilities may be to
drive a large number of atoms to saturation with a strong
auxiliary beam, or make use of light induced desorption
[28] of Rb to optically change the atomic number density.

mission. Fractional broadening is deﬁned as the fractional
increase pulse duration at FWHM (A value of 0 means no
broadening). Due to absorption, the actual broadening is less
than that predicted by the dominant dispersive term, even
though absorptive broadening is negligible.

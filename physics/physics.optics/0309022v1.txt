Abstract

We propose novel multi-phase-matched process that starts with generation
of a pair of symmetric second-harmonic waves. Each of them interacts again
with the fundamental wave to produce two constructively interfering third har-
monic waves collinear to the fundamental input wave.

Nonlinear photonic crystals have attracted much interest lately because of their
unique properties and many potential applications in nonlinear optics and optics
communications. Two dimensional nonlinear photonic crystals (2DNPC) [1] allow
realization of simultaneous phase matching of several processes [2], however in most
of the cases generated wave is noncollinear to the input fundamental wave that was
considered as a disadvantage for 2DNPC. Here we propose for the ﬁrst time phase-
matching geometry for third harmonic (TH) generation in 2DNPC, for which gen-
erated TH wave is collinear to the input wave.
In addition to that the proposed
interaction at low input intensities is four times more eﬃcient than the conventional
schemes.

Ga, Gb, G−a are shown on the Fig.

Multiple phase matching geometry is
presented on Fig. 2. The process starts
with generation of pair second harmonic
waves with wave vectors k2u, k2d. Phase
matching is assured by the reciprocal
fundamental vectors Ga, G−a . Each sec-
ond harmonic wave interacts again with
the fundamental wave via pair phase
matched interaction with participation
of the reciprocal vectors generating this
way pair collinear TH waves with one
and the same wave vector k3. The recip-
rocal vectors that phase match the pro-
cesses of sum frequency mixing ω + 2ω = 3ω are combination of the two fundamental
reciprocal vectors Gc = NGb − Ga ; G−c = NGb − G−a. The two TH waves inter-
fere constructively in the direction of the input fundamental wave leading this way
to higher overall TH eﬃciency. The process is described by system of 5 diﬀerential
equations, that have been solved in several approximation. Design and optimization
of TH frequency converters made from 2DNPC implemented in LiNbO3 and LiTaO3
is presented. The frequency converter can be also useful for testing the homogeneity
of the sample. The better is the homogeneity the higher will be TH eﬃciency.

The spectral dependence of a bending loss of cascaded 60-degree bends in photonic crystal
(PhC) waveguides is explored in a slab-type silicon-on-insulator system. Ultra-low bending loss of
(0.05±0.03)dB/bend is measured at wavelengths corresponding to the nearly dispersionless trans-
mission regime. In contrast, the PhC bend is found to become completely opaque for wavelengths
range corresponding to the slow light regime. A general strategy is presented and experimentally
veriﬁed to optimize the bend design for improved slow light transmission.

Planar two-dimensional photonic crystal (PhC) waveg-
uides have a strong potential to realize ultra-dense pho-
tonic integrated-circuits. An important component of a
compact photonic circuit is a small-radius low-loss waveg-
uide bend that eﬃciently maneuvers light around sharp
corners1. Many papers have investigated PhC bends
focusing mainly on the optimization of the amplitude
transmission? . Largely ignored, however, is the spec-
tral dependence of the bend loss. It is known that PhC
waveguides are characterized by very large group veloc-
ity dispersion especially at wavelengths close to the on-
set of the waveguiding mode10,11. The strong distributed
feedback at these wavelengths results in signiﬁcantly re-
duced group velocity. The possibility to slow down the
propagation of light is envisioned to have a broad range
of applications from all-optical data storage to quantum
computing12. Therefore transmission in this ”slow light”
regime needs to be carefully studied for various optical
components, if the ”slow light”-based circuits are to be
built. This paper focuses on the spectral dependence of
losses of PhC bends with a special emphasis on the ”slow
light” regime.

The PhC waveguides were fabricated on 200mm
silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers with 2µ m thick buried
oxide (BOX) and 220nm thick silicon layer. The peri-
odic array of holes with a triangular lattice (lattice con-
stant a=437nm) was ﬁrst written in the resist layer with
electron beam lithography. The PhC waveguides were
formed by removing a row of holes in the Γ-K direction
of the lattice. The pattern was then transferred to an ox-
ide hard mask using CF4/CHF3/Ar chemistry and the Si
layer was etched next with an HBr-based chemistry. The
underlying BOX was wet etched in the PhC section to
create a suspended Si membrane. An additional lithog-
raphy step deﬁned the polymer cladding of the inverted
taper spot-size converter for eﬃcient ﬁber coupling13,14.
In order to improve the experimental accuracy of loss
measurements, devices with a number of bends cascaded
in series were fabricated as shown in Fig.1a. The bends
were separated from each other by straight waveguide
sections 20 lattice constants long. To optically charac-
terize the devices, light from a broadband LED source
(1200 to 1700nm) is coupled to the PM ﬁber, transferred

through the polarization controller and ﬁnally launched
into the device with a microlensed PM ﬁber tip. Trans-
mission spectra were measured for the TE polarization
(E-ﬁeld parallel to the slab plane) with a resolution
of 5nm. The measured transmission spectra through
straight and bent PhC waveguides were normalized on
transmission through a reference straight strip waveguide
following the method of Ref.13.

The design of the PhC bend similar to the one shown
in Fig.1b was characterized ﬁrst. This simple bend is
formed by connecting two W1 waveguides rotated by 60
degrees with respect to each other. Figure 2 represents

experimental transmission spectra of 10 and 20 of such
cascaded simple bends formed in a PhC lattice with a
hole radius of 100nm (0.23a). The spectra show a trans-
mission band with 50nm bandwidth deﬁned by two sharp
cut-oﬀs around 1605 and 1655nm. Spectra measured for
10 and 20 cascaded bends are almost identical, especially
for 1627-1635nm spectral region shown in the inset in
magniﬁed view, indicating low bending loss. Statisti-
cal analysis of measurements performed on a number of
identical devices gives a cumulative loss of 0.55dB per
10 bends that includes a small loss component of 0.07dB
which is the expected loss of a straight PhC waveguide
sections of equivalent length (90µm)14. The standard de-
viation is estimated for these measurements as 0.33dB,
owing mainly to the small deviation in the coupling eﬃ-
ciency from one device to another. This gives the bend-
ing loss per single bend of (0.05±0.03)dB/bend. To our
knowledge this is the lowest bending loss that has yet
been reported for PhC bends.

If bends are to be used to construct complex PhC-
based circuits such as a Mach-Zehnder interferometer
employing straight PhC waveguides and multiple bends,
transmission characteristics of the bend need to be an-
alyzed with respect to diﬀerent transmission regimes of
a straight PhC waveguide. The black curve in Fig.2a
represents the transmission spectrum of a 181µm long

straight PhC waveguide which corresponds to the same
length as the devices with 20 cascaded bends. Compari-
son of the experimental spectrum with the photonic band
structure calculated with the 3D plane-wave method15
shown in Fig.2b allows identiﬁcation of the sharp cut-oﬀ
at 1687nm as the onset of the waveguiding mode. The
waveguide is characterized by very strong group veloc-
ity dispersion with a group index becoming increasingly
large in the region 1660nm-1687nm. This region can be
deﬁned as the ”slow light” regime (region I in Fig.2b).
The dispersion is almost linear, corresponding to nearly
constant group index, in the wavelength region between
1660nm and 1560nm, which can be deﬁned as the ”linear”
regime (region II). At wavelengths above 1560nm (region
III), where the mode is crossing the light-line, the losses
are increasing progressively due to out-of-plane leakage.
The transmission spectra of the bend exhibit drasti-
cally diﬀerent behavior for wavelengths corresponding
to the three regimes. At wavelengths corresponding to
region III, where the mode is becoming leaky for the
straight PhC waveguide, the bend does not transmit any
light as shown in Fig.2a presumably due to signiﬁcant in-
crease in out-of-plane losses at the bend. However, since
the loss for a straight PhC waveguide is already very large
here, approaching 1500dB/cm13,14, region III is not very
useful for integrated photonics.

In contrast, bending loss in the ”linear” regime (re-
gion II) is extremely small not exceeding 0.05dB/bend
as demonstrated above. This low bending loss is compa-
rable to bending losses measured in tightly curved bends
in single-mode strip waveguides16. However, as opposed
to strip waveguide bends operating over broadband wave-
lengths, the PhC bend does not have a continuous trans-
mission band.
In Fig.2a at wavelengths corresponding
to region II a series of sharp dips are seen with attenu-
ation signiﬁcantly increasing as the number of cascaded
bends increases, indicating much higher bending loss of
the order of 1dB/bend. These dips result from small
stopbands formed in the experimental optical circuit in
which straight and bend sections are repeated periodi-
cally.

Attaining low bending loss in the region I is crucial for
constructing optical circuits utilizing slow group velocity.
Surprisingly, comparison of transmission spectra (Fig.2a)
of a straight PhC waveguide and PhC bends reveals that
bends are completely opaque in this region. The long-
wavelength cutoﬀ of the bend around 1655nm appears
to be blue shifted by 30nm (blue arrow) with respect
to the 1687nm cutoﬀ characteristic of the straight PhC
waveguide. This blueshift is too large to be explained
by small variation of the lattice parameters between ref-
erence PhC straight waveguide and the bend structure.
Moreover, detailed inspection of a number of SEM im-
ages as in Fig.1 reveals that the hole radii and the lattice
constant in both structures are identical within 1nm.

This spectral blueshift can be explained by making
analogy to conventional strip and rib waveguide bends17.
It is known that the mode in curved waveguides is pulled

away from the center of curvature toward the outer edge
of the bend, thus seeing a lower average refractive index
with respect to the mode in the straight waveguide17. If
this mechanism can be extended to describe mode be-
havior in PhC waveguide bends, the PhC Bloch mode
is pulled toward its outer corner where it samples more
holes. Hence, the average refractive index that the mode
encounter at the bend is smaller, which explains the
experimentally observed blueshift of the cutoﬀ.
In in-
tegrated optics, the usual way to compensate the dis-
tortion of the mode proﬁle at the bend is to oﬀset the
bend section with respect to the straight section or to in-
crease the refractive index at the bend by increasing its
width17. Recent theoretical calculations have conﬁrmed
that a similar hypothesis is applicable to PhC waveguide
bends18. A modiﬁed design is proposed where the aver-
age refractive index at the bend is eﬀectively increased
by decreasing the radius of holes in the bend vicinity18.
To experimentally verify this strategy, an additional
set of devices was investigated, fabricated on the same
wafer as the previous devices. The hole radii of the PhC
lattice for this set was chosen to be 144nm (0.33a) in or-
der to compare the experimental results directly to the
theoretical calculations of Ref.18. This device set con-
sisted of cascaded simple bends analogous to that stud-
ied earlier (see Fig.1b), and the cascaded modiﬁed bends

(Fig.1c) designed for better transmission in the slow light
regime18.

Figure 3a shows transmission spectra of a straight PhC
waveguide and a simple cascaded PhC bends. The low-
loss transmission window for a straight PhC waveguide
is deﬁned by a long-wavelength cutoﬀ at 1493nm and a
light-line at 1466nm. Band structure calculations sim-
ilar to Fig.2b showed that the ”slow light” regime I in
this case corresponds to wavelengths range of 1478nm-
1493nm. Similar to the results obtained in Fig.2a, the
spectrum of the simple bend is characterized by a rela-
tively low-loss transmission band extending over the ”lin-
ear” regime and interrupted by sharp dips. The long-
wavelength cutoﬀ of a bend spectrum at 1478nm is blue
shifted by almost 15nm with respect to the cutoﬀ posi-
tion in a straight PhC waveguide. Thus, the simple bend
in this structure appears to be completely opaque in the
”slow light” regime as previously observed in the results
of Fig.2.

Figure 3b represents spectra of 10 and 20 cascaded
bends, which are modiﬁed by reducing the radius of four
holes adjacent to the bend section to 105nm (0.24a) as
shown in Fig.1c. Transmission spectra of 10 and 20 cas-
caded modiﬁed bends have similar spectral features as
seen in the spectrum of a simple bend. The ”linear”
regime of a modiﬁed bend is characterized by a relatively
low loss 0.1dB/bend comparable to the results of Fig.2a.
As expected, the long-wavelength cutoﬀ of the modiﬁed
bend occurs at wavelengths longer than for a simple bend.
Hence, by increasing the average refractive index at the
bend the initial 15nm blueshift of the cutoﬀ is signiﬁ-
cantly reduced to only 6nm rendering a large portion of
the ”slow light” regime transparent.

The modiﬁed bends with 4 small holes clearly do not
fully compensate the initial blueshift. The experiments
described above can be viewed as a proof-of-principle
demonstration of a general strategy, rather than a ﬁnal
solution. Following the analogy with the bends in con-
ventional waveguides, the transmission in the ”slow light”
regime might be improved not only by the increase of the
refractive index at the bend as shown here, but also by
creating an oﬀset of the bend section with respect to the
straight PhC waveguide.

In conclusion,

ultra-low bending

only
(0.05±0.03)dB/turn is measured in a simple 60-degree
PhC bend. It is found that simple PhC bends are com-
pletely opaque for the wavelength region corresponding
to small group velocity regime of a straight PhC waveg-
uide. Increasing the average refractive index at the bend
by decreasing the radius of 4 holes adjacent to the bend
section allows to almost compensate the blueshift of the
transmission cutoﬀ and to restore transparency for slow
light.

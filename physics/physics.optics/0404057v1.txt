Abstract: We report on an easy-to-evaluate expression for the prediction
of the bend-loss for a large mode area photonic crystal ﬁber (PCF) with a
triangular air-hole lattice. The expression is based on a recently proposed
formulation of the V-parameter for a PCF and contains no free parameters.
The validity of the expression is veriﬁed experimentally for varying
ﬁber parameters as well as bend radius. The typical deviation between
the position of the measured and the predicted bend loss edge is within
measurement uncertainty.

Introduction

In solid-core photonic crystal ﬁbers (PCF) the air-silica microstructured cladding (see Fig. 1)
gives rise to a variety of novel phenomena [1] including large-mode area (LMA) endlessly-
single mode operation [2]. Though PCFs typically have optical properties very different from
that of standard ﬁbers they of course share some of the overall properties such as the suscepti-
bility of the attenuation to macro-bending.

Macrobending-induced attenuation in PCFs has been addressed both experimentally as well
as theoretically/numerically in a number of papers [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. However, predicting bending-
loss is no simple task and typically involves a full numerical solution of Maxwell’s equations
as well as use of a phenomenological free parameter, e.g. an effective core radius. In this paper
we revisit the problem and show how macro-bending loss measurements on high-quality PCFs
can be predicted with high accuracy using easy-to-evaluate empirical relations.

2. Predicting macro-bending loss

Predictions of macro-bending induced attenuation in photonic crystal ﬁbers have been made
using various approaches including antenna-theory for bent standard ﬁbers [3, 4], coupling-
length criteria [2, 5], and phenomenological models within the tilted-index representation [6].
Here, we also apply the antenna-theory of Sakai and Kimura [7, 8], but contrary to Refs. [3, 4]
we make a full transformation of standard-ﬁber parameters such as D
, W , and V [9] to ﬁber
parameters appropriate to high-index contrast PCFs with a triangular arrangement of air holes.
In the large-mode area limit we get (see Appendix)

3. Experimental results

We have fabricated three LMA ﬁbers by the stack-and-pull method and characterized them
using the conventional cut-back technique. All three ﬁbers have a triangular air-hole array and
a solid core formed by a single missing air-hole in the center of the structure, see Fig. 1.

For the LMA-20 macro-bending loss has been measured for bending radii of R=8 cm and
R=16 cm and the results are shown in Fig. 2. The predictions of Eq. (1) are also included. It is
emphasized that the predictions are based on the empirical relations for Aeff and VPCF provided
in Refs. [12] and [13] respectively and therefore do not require any numerical calculations.
Similar results are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 for the LMA-25 and LMA-35 ﬁbers, respectively.

4. Discussion and conclusion

The PCF, in theory, exhibits both a short and long-wavelength bend-edge. However, the results
presented here only indicate a short-wavelength bend-edge. The reason for this is that the long-
L /2 [3]. For typical LMA-PCFs it is therefor located in
wavelength bend-edge occurs for l
the non-transparent wavelength regime of silica.

≫

In conclusion we have demonstrated that macro-bending loss measurements on high-quality
PCFs can be predicted with good accuracy using easy-to-evaluate empirical relations with only
d and L
as input parameters. Since macro-bending attenuation for many purposes and applica-
tions is the limiting factor we believe that the present results will be useful in practical designs
of optical systems employing photonic crystal ﬁbers.

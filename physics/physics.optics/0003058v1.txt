1 Problem

In the usual formulation of the Kirchhoﬀ diﬀraction integral, a scalar ﬁeld with harmonic
time dependence at frequency ω is deduced at the interior of a charge-free volume from
knowledge of the ﬁeld (or its normal derivative) on the bounding surface. In particular, the
ﬁeld is propagated forwards in time from the boundary to the desired observation point.

Construct a time-reversed version of the Kirchhoﬀ integral in which the knowledge of the

ﬁeld on the boundary is propagated backwards in time into the interior of the volume.

Consider the example of an optical focus at the origin for a system with the z axis as the
√2σθ, and
optic axis. In the far ﬁeld beyond the focus a Gaussian beam has cone angle θ0 ≡
the x component of the electric ﬁeld in a spherical coordinate system is given approximately
by

Ex(r, θ, φ, t) = E(r)ei(kr−ωt)e−θ2/θ2
0,

(1)

where k = ω/c and c is the speed of light. Deduce the ﬁeld near the focus.

Since the Kirchhoﬀ diﬀraction formalism requires the volume to be charge free, the time-
reversed technique is not applicable to cases where the source of the ﬁeld is inside the
volume. Nonetheless, the reader may ﬁnd it instructive to attempt to apply the time-reversed
diﬀraction integral to the example of an oscillating dipole at the origin.

2 The Kirchhoﬀ Integral via Green’s Theorem

A standard formulation of Kirchhoﬀ’s diﬀraction integral for a scalar ﬁeld ψ(x) with time
dependence e−iωt is

ψ(x) ≈

k

2πi ZS

eikr′
r′ ψ(x′)dArea′,

(2)

where the spherical waves ei(kr′−ωt)/r′ are outgoing, and r′ is the magnitude of vector r′ =
x − x′.
For a time-reversed formulation in which we retain the time dependence as e−iωt, the
spherical waves of interest are the incoming waves e−i(kr′+ωt)/r′. In brief, the desired time-
reversed diﬀraction integral is obtained from eq. (2) on replacing i by −i:

ψ(x) ≈

ik

2π ZS

e−ikr′
r′ ψ(x′)dArea′.

(3)

For completeness, we review the derivation of eqs. (2)-(3) via Green’s theorem. See also,

sec. 10.5 of ref. [1].

Green tells us that for any two well-behaved scalar ﬁelds φ and ψ,

ZV

(φ∇2ψ − ψ∇2φ)dVol = ZS

(φ∇′ψ − ψ∇′φ) · dS′.

(4)

The surface element dS′ is directly outward from surface S. We consider ﬁelds with harmonic
time dependence at frequency ω, and assume the factor e−iωt. The wave function of interest,
ψ, is assumed to have no sources within volume V , and so obeys the Helmholtz wave equation,

We choose function φ(x) to correspond to waves associated with a point source at x′.

∇2ψ + k2ψ = 0.

(5)

That is,

The well-known solutions to this are the incoming and outgoing spherical waves,

∇2φ + k2φ = −δ3(x − x′).

φ±(x, x′) =

e±ikr′

where the + sign corresponds to the outgoing wave. We recall that

∇′r′ = −

r′ = −ˆno,

where ˆno points towards the observer at x. Then,

∇′φ± = ∓ik ˆno (cid:18)1 ±

Inserting eqs. (5)-(9) into eq. (4), we ﬁnd

(9)

(10)

where the overall minus sign holds with the convention that ˆn′ is the inward normal to the
surface.

We only consider cases where the source of the wave ψ is far from the boundary surface,

so that on the boundary ψ is well approximated as a spherical wave,

ψ(x′) ≈ A

,

(11)

where rs is the magnitude of the vector rs = x′ − xs from the eﬀective source point xs to
the point x′ on the boundary surface. In this case,
∇′ψ = ik ˆns (cid:18)1 ±

ikrs(cid:19) ψ,

1

(12)

where ˆns = rs/rs

2

We also suppose that the observation point is far from the boundary surface, so that

kr′ ≪ 1 as well as krs ≪ 1. Hence, we neglect the terms in 1/ikr′ and 1/ikrs to ﬁnd

ψ(x) = −

ik

4π ZS

e±ikr′
r′ ˆn′ · (ˆns ± ˆno)ψ(x′)dArea′.

(13)

The usual formulation, eq. (2), of Kirchhoﬀ’s law is obtained using outgoing waves (+
sign), and the paraxial approximation that ˆn′ ≈ ˆno ≈ ˆns. The latter tacitly assumes that
the eﬀective source is outside volume V .
Here, we are interested in the case where the eﬀective source is inside the volume V , so
that the paraxial approximation is ˆn′ ≈ ˆno ≈ −ˆns. When we use the incoming wave function
to reconstruct ψ(x, t) from information on the boundary at time t′ > t, we use the − sign in
eq. (13) to ﬁnd eq. (3).
Note that in this derivation, we assumed that ψ obeyed eq. (5) throughout volume V ,
and so the actual source of ψ cannot be within V . Our time-reversed Kirchhoﬀ integral (3)
can only be applied when any source inside V is virtual. This includes the interesting case of
a focus of an optical system (secs. 4 and 5). However, we cannot expect eq. (3) to apply to
the case of a physical source, such as an oscillating dipole, inside volume V (sec. 6). The laws
of diﬀraction do not permit electromagnetic waves to converge into a volume smaller than
a wavelength cubed, and so eq. (3) cannot be expected to describe the near ﬁelds around a
source smaller than this.

3 A Plane Wave

The time-reversed Kirchhoﬀ integral (3) for the x component of the electric ﬁeld is

Ex(obs, now) =

(14)

where r′ is the distance from the observation point robs = (x, y, z) in rectangular coordinates
to a point r = r(sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ) on a sphere of radius r in the far ﬁeld.

As a ﬁrst example, consider a plane electromagnetic wave,

Ex = E0ei(kz−ωt) = E0ei(kr cos θ−ωt),

(15)

where the second form holds in a spherical coordinate system (r, θ, φ) where θ is measured
with respect to the z axis. We take the point of observation to be (x, y, z) = (0, 0, r0), and
In the exponential

factor in the Kirchhoﬀ integral, we approximate r′ as

while in the denominator we approximate r′ as r. Then,

r′ ≈ r − ˆr · robs = r − r0 cos θ,

This veriﬁes that the time-reversed diﬀraction formula works for a simple example.

4 The Transverse Field near a Laser Focus

We now consider the far ﬁeld of a laser beam whose optic axis is the z axis with focal
point at the origin. The polarization is along the x axis, and the electric ﬁeld has Gaussian
dependence on polar angle with characteristic angle θ0 ≪ 1. Then, we can write

Ex(r, θ, φ) = E(r)eikre−θ2/θ2
0 ,

(18)

where E(r) is the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld on the optic axis at distance r from the
focus. In the exponential factor in the Kirchhoﬀ integral (14), r′ is the distance from the
observation point r|rmobs = (x, y, z) to a point r = r(sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ) on the sphere.
We approximate r′ as

r′ ≈ r − ˆr · robs = r − x sin θ cos φ − y sin θ sin φ − z cos θ,

(19)

while in the denominator we approximate r′ as r. Inserting eqs. (18) and (19) into (14), we
ﬁnd

and J0 is the Bessel function of order zero.

Since we assume that the characteristic angle θ0 of the laser beam is small, we can

approximate cos θ as 1 − θ2/2 and kρ sin θ as kρθ. Then, we have

(22)

where the Laplace transform, which is given explicitly in [2], can be evaluated using the
series expansion for the Bessel function. This expression can be put in a more familiar form
by introducing the Rayleigh range (depth of focus),

and the so-called waist of the laser beam,

We deﬁne the electric ﬁeld strength at the focus (ρ = 0, z = 0) to be E0, so we learn that
the far-ﬁeld strength is related by

E(r) = −i

z0
r

E0.

(25)

The factor −i = e−iπ/2 is the 90◦ Guoy phase shift between the focus and the far ﬁeld. Then,
the transverse component of the electric ﬁeld near the focus is

(26)

This is the usual form for the lowest-order mode of a linearly polarized Gaussian laser beam
[3]. Figure 1 plots this ﬁeld.

Figure 1: The electric ﬁeld Ex(x, 0, z) of a linearly polarized Gaussian beam
with diﬀraction angle θ0 = 0.45.

The Gaussian beam (26) could also be deduced by a similar argument using eq. (2),
starting from the far ﬁeld of the laser before the focus. The form (26) is symmetric in z

5

except for a phase factor, and so is a solution to the problem of transporting a wave from
z = −r to z = +r such that the functional dependence on ρ and z is invariant up to a phase
factor. One of the earliest derivations [4] of the Gaussian beam was based on the formulation
of this problem as an integral equation for the eigenfunction (26).

5 The Longitudinal Field

Far from the focus, the electric ﬁeld E(r) is perpendicular to the radius vector r. For a ﬁeld
linearly polarized in the x direction, there must also be a longitudinal component Ez related
by

Thus, far from the focus,

E · ˆr = Ex sin θ cos φ + Ez cos θ = 0.

Ez(r) = −Ex(r) tan θ cos φ.

Then, similarly to eqs. (14) and (20), we have

eq. (29) as the Laplace transform

Together, the electric ﬁeld components given by eqs. (26) and (30) satisfy the Maxwell

equation ∇ · E = 0 to order θ2

0 [6, 7, 8].

6 Oscillating Dipole at the Origin

We cannot expect the Kirchhoﬀ diﬀraction integral to apply to the example of an oscillating
dipole, if our bounding surface surrounds the dipole. Let us see what happens if we try to
use eq. (3) anyway.

6

Figure 2: The electric ﬁeld Ez(x, 0, z) of a linearly polarized Gaussian beam
with diﬀraction angle θ0 = 0.45.

The dipole is taken to be at the origin, with moment p along the x axis. Then, the x

component of the radiation ﬁeld is

Ex = k2p sin θx

eikr
r

.

(31)

where θx is the angle between the x axis and a radius vector to the observer. We consider
an observer near the origin at (x, y, z) = (0, 0, r0), for which sin θx = 1, and so

Ex(obs) = k2p

eikr0
r0

.

(32)

We now attempt to reconstruct this ﬁeld near the origin from its value on a sphere of
radius r using the time-reversed Kirchhoﬀ integral (3). We use a spherical coordinate system
(r, θ, φ) that favors the z axis. Then, the x component of the radiation ﬁeld on the sphere
of radius r is

Ex(r, θ, φ) = k2pq1 − sin2 θ cos2 φ

eikr
r

.

(33)

This form cannot be integrated analytically, so we use a Taylor expansion of the square root,
which will lead to an expansion in powers of 1/r0. It turns out that the coeﬃcient of the

7

1/r0 term, which is our main interest, is very close to that if we simply approximate the
square root by unity. For brevity, we write

Ex(r, θ, φ) ≈ k2p

eikr
r

.

(34)

In the time-reversed Kirchhoﬀ integral (3), we make the usual approximation that r′ =
r − r0 cos θ in the exponential factor, but r′ = r in the denominator. Then, using eq. (34)
we have

(35)

The ﬁrst, outgoing wave in middle line of eq. (35) is the desired form, but the second,
incoming wave is of the same magnitude. Together, they lead to the form sin(kr0)/kr0
which is nearly constant for kr0 <
∼ 1. The presence of outgoing as well as incoming waves is
to be expected because dipole radiation is azimuthally symmetric about the x axis. In the
absence of a charged source at the origin, an outgoing wave at θ = π must correspond to an
incoming wave at θ = 0.

The result that the reconstructed ﬁeld is uniform for distances within a wavelength of the
origin is consistent with the laws of diﬀraction that electromagnetic waves cannot be focused
to a region smaller than a wavelength. Far ﬁelds of the form (31) could only be propagated
back to the form of dipole ﬁelds near the origin with the addition of nonradiation ﬁelds tied
to a charge at the origin. Such a construction is outside the scope of optics and diﬀraction.

Abstract

We consider chromatic dispersion of capillary tubes and photonic
crystal ﬁbers inﬁltrated with liquid crystals. A perturbative scheme
for inclusion of material dispersion of both liquid crystal and the sur-
rounding waveguide material is derived. The method is used to cal-
culate the chromatic dispersion at diﬀerent temperatures.

1 Introduction

Together with the development of photonic crystal ﬁbers (PCFs), a large
amount of research has been devoted to investigate the possibilities of inﬁl-
trating the air holes of a PCF with diﬀerent liquids[1], and thereby changing
the optical properties of the ﬁber. Depending on the refractive index of the
liquid, the guiding eﬀect of the ﬁber can possibly be changed from guiding
based on modiﬁed total internal reﬂection (mTIR), to guiding based on the
photonic band gap eﬀect, where the core has a lower refractive index than the
eﬀective index of the cladding. Also selective ﬁlling of PCFs, where only some
of the holes are inﬁltrated, has experienced a considerable interest[2, 3, 4],
because this can be used to tailor the optical characteristics of the PCF.
Among the various liquids that can be inﬁltrated in a PCF, liquid crystals
(LC) distinguishes themselves, because of their anisotropic nature, which al-
lows the possibility of controlling the optical parameters of the waveguide by
changing the orientation of the molecules[5]. This orientation can be con-
trolled in diﬀerent ways, for example by applying an electric ﬁeld externally.
The optical characteristics of the ﬁber can also be changed by varying the
temperature, since the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices of LCs
are highly dependent on temperature. Recently these tunable properties of

2

LCs have been used in various experimental research projects[6, 7].
The LC can be inﬁltrated in the PCF using various techniques, one possibil-
ity is to use a pressure chamber, but this technique has shown to introduce
orientational irregularities in the alignment of LC molecules[8]. Another
possibility is to inﬁltrate the holes of the PCF using capillary forces, this
technique has shown to give a regular alignment of the LC molecules. A
disadvantage using capillary forces for the inﬁltration is that the length of
the inﬁltrated region will only be of the order of a few centimeters, while
longer inﬁltration lengths can be achieved using pressure inﬁltration.
In the present work we address the problem of calculating chromatic disper-
sion curves for diﬀerent waveguide designs, where the material dispersion of
both the LC and waveguide material is taken into account. The LC inﬁltrated
PCF structures we consider have previously been studied theoretically[4],
without inclusion of material dispersion in the PCF material and LC, and
only considering the special case where the extraordinary index of the LC
and the index of the PCF material were identical. The material dispersion
of LC is important to take into account, since LCs are highly dispersive, es-
pecially in the visible spectrum, where the dispersion can be much stronger
than in for example silica. It has previously been shown that approximating
the total dispersion simply by adding the waveguide and material dispersion
gives the correct qualitative behavior of the dispersion curve[9], but is not
suﬃcient if quantitative data for the dispersion is needed, for example to
determine the position of zero dispersion wavelengths (ZDWs).
To calculate precise dispersion proﬁles, we must therefore include the mate-
rial dispersion in the ﬁeld equations. This destroys the well known scalability
of Maxwells equations, hence if all the physical dimensions of the ﬁber are
multiplied by a constant factor, we are not able to calculate the new dis-
persion curve without having to solve the ﬁeld equations again. In addition,
if the computational method used to ﬁnd the eigenmodes numerically takes
the propagation constant as an input variable, and returns the correspond-
ing frequency, we must ensure that this is done in a self-consistent manner,
i.e. the values of the dielectric constants in the numerical calculation must
correspond to the values of the dielectric constants at the frequency returned
by the computational method.
In this work we ﬁnd the self-consistent frequencies based on a generaliza-
tion of a perturbative method developed for isotropic waveguides[10]. We
consider dispersion proﬁles of both simple waveguides consisting of capillary
silica tubes inﬁltrated with LCs, and more advanced selectively ﬁlled PCF

structures. Finally we investigate how a change in temperature aﬀects the
dispersion characteristics of the ﬁber.

2 Theory

2.1 Alignments of LC-molecules

In all the ﬁber designs considered in this work the LC is contained inside a
hollow circular cylinder. It is well known that an intense optical ﬁeld will
interact with the LC and change the orientation of the molecules[11], here we
assume that the intensity of the optical ﬁeld is so weak that we can neglect
this interaction. The LC is assumed to be in the nematic phase, where the
orientation of the molecules is correlated, resulting in a preferred local ori-
entation of the molecules. This local orientation is described by the director
axis n(r) which is a unit vector pointing in the same direction as the axis of
the LC-molecules. In the general case n(r) is found by minimization of elas-
tic energy. For the cylindrical geometry considered here the director axis has
the following form n = (sin(θ), 0, cos(θ)) in cylindrical coordinates (r, φ, z). θ
is the angle between the director axis n and the z-axis. The alignment of the
LC molecules in this situation has previously been studied theoretically[12].
θ(r) can be found by solving a 2nd. order nonlinear ordinary diﬀerential
equation, where the only parameters are the elastic constants of the LC. We
assume that the molecules along r = 0 are aligned parallel to the z-axis
(θ(0) = 0). The boundary condition at the cylinder wall depends on the LC
and the coating of the capillary. Here we consider the two diﬀerent possibil-
ities θ(R) = 0 and θ(R) = π/2, where R is the radius of the cylinder. The
dielectric tensor of a nematic LC is described in terms of the perpendicular
and parallel part of the optical permittivity ǫ⊥ and ǫ||. If the orientation of
the molecules is described by the angle θ(r), then the dielectric tensor has
the following form in cylindrical coordinates[12]

where ǫrr = ǫ⊥ + ∆ǫ sin2 θ, ǫrz = ǫzr = ∆ǫ sin θ cos θ, ǫφφ = ǫ⊥ and ǫzz =

elastic constants of the LC describing twist, splay and bend deformations are

assumed to be equal, and we further assume that the molecules are aligned
parallel with the z-axis in the center of the cylinder, the orientation is given
by θ(r) = 2 tan−1(ar/R), where a is a constant depending on the bound-
ary condition at the wall. For the boundary conditions considered here we
have the two simple analytical solutions θ(r) = 0 and θ(r) = 2 tan−1(r/R),
depending on whether the molecules are anchored parallel or perpendicular
to the boundary of the cylinder. The two orientations are shown schemat-

of the LC molecules, and refer to them as planar (θ(r) = 0) and axial
(θ(r) = 2 tan−1(r/R)) alignment. The planar alignment is easily achieved
experimentally, while axial alignment requires that the capillary is coated
with a surfactant before the LC is inﬁltrated[8].

2.2 Calculation of chromatic dispersion curves

In this section we derive a perturbative method for calculation of chromatic
dispersion of a waveguide inﬁltrated with LC. The method is general and
can be applied to arbitrary waveguide designs. Our method is a general-
ization of an earlier presented method for isotropic waveguides[10], but this
method allows the possibility that the waveguide consists of anisotropic ma-
terials. We consider a waveguide which is uniform along the z-direction, and
therefore assume that the magnetic ﬁeld can be described in the form of
a monochromatic wave travelling along the z-direction, i.e. H(x, y, z, t) =
exp[i(βz − ωt)]h(x, y; β). From Maxwells equations the following equation

where the operator ∇β is given by ∇β = (∂/∂x, ∂/∂y, iβ). ¯¯ǫ is the dielectric
tensor, which in the LC region is given by the expression in Eq. (1). In the
silica region the dielectric tensor is simply a diagonal matrix, with the dielec-
tric constant of silica in the diagonal. Therefore ¯¯ǫ = ¯¯ǫ(r, ǫS(ω), ǫ⊥(ω), ǫ||(ω)),
i.e.
the dielectric function depends on position, the dielectric constant of
the material surrounding the LC (ǫS), and the dielectric constants ǫ⊥ and
ǫ|| of the LC. Since material dispersion is taken into account, all 3 dielectric
constants are assumed to be frequency dependent. The dispersion coeﬃcient
is deﬁned by

where vg is the group velocity, deﬁned as vg = dω

Now the group velocity is found by diﬀerentiating both sides of Eq.
(5)
with respect to the propagation constant β. The left hand side of Eq. (5)
is diﬀerentiated with respect to β using the Hellman-Feynman theorem. To
diﬀerentiate the operator Φ with respect to β, we note that the operator
depends on β explicitly through ∇β, and implicitly through the dielectric
constants ǫj = ǫj(ω(β)) (j = S, ⊥, ||).
In the following ∂/∂β denotes a
diﬀerentiation for ﬁxed dielectric constants. Using this notation we have the

Eqs.

Eqs. (15) have been solved for ∆ǫi, our approximation to the selfconsistent
frequency is readily found using Eq. (11). Since our goal is to use Eq. (9) for
ﬁnding the group velocity, we must also ﬁnd an approximation to v0
g. This

In Eq. (17) and (15) we ﬁnd the derivatives of the dielectric constants by
diﬀerentiating the Sellmeier or Cauchy polynomial presented in the following
with respect to frequency. Ej is found from the ﬁelds returned by the com-
putational method, when using the dielectric constants ǫi,0. Strictly speaking
the values of Ej used in Eq. (17) should be the values calculated at the self-
consistent frequency. This would require solving Eq. (2) more than one time,
and therefore signiﬁcantly increase the calculation time for each propagation
constant, but we have found that the variations in Ej with ǫi can safely be
neglected. The derivatives of Ej with respect to β are found using a standard
three point approximation. After having found the selfconsistent frequencies
and the corresponding group velocities for a number of propagation constants
β, we ﬁnd the dispersion D by using the deﬁnition given in Eq. (4), in this
calculation the derivative of the group velocity vg with respect to frequency
ω is also approximated using a three point formula.

Both the planar and axial alignment discussed in the previous section are
considered. For the material dispersion of silica we use the Sellmeier curve

where ai and bi are constants. Here we use the values in Table 1 as reported
by Okamoto[13].

given in Table 1 as reported by Li et al [14] at 25oC and 50oC. The values
obtained for the dielectric constants using these parameters in the Cauchy
polynomials have been shown to be consistent with measured values through-
out the visible spectrum and far into the infrared spectrum. In Fig. 2 we
have plotted the three dielectric constants ǫS, ǫ⊥ and ǫ|| as a function of vac-
uum wavelength. We see that the dielectric constant of silica (ǫS) is below
the two dielectric constants of E7 (ǫ⊥ and ǫ||) throughout the visible spec-
trum and into the near infrared spectrum, hence a waveguide based on TIR
can be realized in this spectrum. In the following we examine the chromatic
dispersion for diﬀerent waveguides based on TIR for the capillary tubes, and
modiﬁed TIR for the PCFs. Whenever the perturbative method is used to
obtain self-consistent frequencies, the guesses for the self-consistent values of

the dielectric constants ǫj,0 are taken to be the values corresponding to a vac-
uum wavelength of 1µm. We solve Eq. (2) using a freely available software
package[15] where the electric ﬁeld is expanded in plane waves. In this soft-
ware package periodic boundary conditions are assumed on all boundaries,
therefore all calculations for both the single capillary and the PCF structure
are done using a supercell which is considerably larger than the LC inﬁltrated
cylinder in order to minimize interactions between the images. In this work
the distance between repeated images was 14 relative to the radius of the LC
inﬁltrated cylinder for the capillary tubes, and 14 relative to the pitch for the
PCF structures. Each elementary cell of the supercell consisted of a uniform
32 × 32 grid. The relative error using these parameters was estimated to be
below 5%, by repeating a set of the computations on a ﬁner 64 × 64 grid.

3.1 Capillary tube inﬁltrated with LC

First we consider a simple waveguide consisting of a circular hole contain-
ing LC surrounded by a silica cladding. Such a waveguide can be realized
physically by inﬁltrating a capillary tube with LC. If we assume that the LC
molecules align in the planar orientation discussed in the previous section,
the dielectric tensor in Eq. (1) only has nonzero elements in the diagonal, i.e.
¯¯ǫ = diag(ǫ⊥, ǫ⊥, ǫ||). If we further assume the cladding has inﬁnite width, an
analytical solution to Eq. (2) can be derived[16]. We can therefore use this

1.06µm and 0.81µm respectively. In Fig. 3 we have compared the chromatic
dispersion found analytically with the chromatic dispersion found using the
numerical method described above, together with the perturbative method
described in the theory section. We see that the dispersion curves found
numerically together with the perturbative method are quantitatively con-
sistent with the exact dispersion curves. In the inset in Fig. 3 the diﬀerence
between the analytical result and the perturbative result is also plotted, we
see that the smallest deviations between the two results occur in the infrared
region, this is also expected since the material dispersion is lowest in this re-
gion (see Fig. 2). The relative error of the perturbative method is below 5%
in the wavelength interval from 0.6µm to 1.7µm. The dispersion is very high
in the visible spectrum, which is mainly due to the high material dispersion

in this region. Also notice that the dispersion is normal (D < 0) for all the
wavelengths and radii considered for the planar alignment.
For the axial alignment of the LC molecules there only exists an analytical
solution to Eq. (2) for the TE modes[12]. But since the fundamental mode,
i.e. the mode with the lowest frequency, is not a TE-mode we must solve Eq.
(2) numerically to ﬁnd the chromatic dispersion for the fundamental mode.
It turns out that at short wavelengths the fundamental mode is the TM01
mode, while for longer wavelengths the fundamental mode is the hybrid HE11
mode. For the tube radii and wavelengths considered here, the capillary tubes
with the axial orientation are always multimoded. Here we consider the two
modes with lowest frequency; the HE11 and TM01 mode. The dispersion of
these modes as a function of vacuum wavelength is shown in Fig. 4. Again we
see that the dispersion is mostly normal for the wavelengths and tube radii
considered here. But for r = 1.5µm the dispersion becomes anomalous for
vacuum wavelengths higher than approximately 1.4µm for the TM01 mode.
For r = 1.0µm the fundamental mode switches from the HE11 mode to the
TE01 mode at a vacuum wavelength around λ = 1µm. For r = 0.75µm and
r = 1.5µm the switch between the two modes happens below λ = 0.6µm and
above λ = 1.7µm respectively. In an experimental setup light is coupled into
the LC inﬁltrated region using the HE11 mode of a single mode step index
ﬁber which is an even mode. Therefore it will most likely be easiest to excite
the HE11 mode of the LC inﬁltrated region, since this mode is also even, in

contrast to the TM01 which is odd. This is demonstrated in Fig. 5, where
the real part of the x-component of H is plotted for the TM01 and HE11. A
similar behavior is found for the other components of the H-ﬁeld, hence the
TM01 mode is odd (even though the intensity plot of |H|2 in Fig. 4 is even),
and the HE11 mode is even.
In the following the eﬀect of increasing the temperature to 50oC will be
studied. We do not consider temperatures above 50oC, since the clearing
temperature, i.e. the temperature where ǫ⊥ = ǫ||, is around 57oC for E7[14].
Above the clearing temperature the LC is no longer in the anisotropic nematic
phase. The parameters for the ordinary and extraordinary indices of refrac-
tion at 50oC can also be found with Cauchy polynomials. The coeﬃcients at
50oC are given in Table 1, and the dielectric constants at 50oC are plotted in
Fig. 2. We see that the increase in temperature also increases the ordinary
dielectric constant, while the extraordinary dielectric constant is lowered. In
subplot (a) and (b) in Fig. 6 the eﬀect of raising the temperature to 50oC
is shown for the capillary tube with the planar and axial alignment of the
LC molecules. We see that the dispersion increases for both alignments. For
the planar alignment the explanation for this is straight forward. The HE11
mode carries most of its energy in the transverse components of the ﬁeld,
and since the transverse components experiences the ordinary dielectric con-
stant, which increases with temperature, the temperature increase eﬀectively
increases the index diﬀerence between the core and cladding. The increased

index diﬀerence gives rise to the higher dispersion. For the axial alignment
the explanation for the increased dispersion is more complicated than for the
planar alignment. Here a ﬁeld which is mostly transverse will experience ǫ⊥
near the center of the cylinder, and ǫ|| near the wall of the cylinder. Since ǫ⊥
increases and ǫ|| decreases with temperature, as shown in Fig. 2, it is diﬃcult
to say a priori whether the dispersion is increased or decreased.

3.2 PCF inﬁltrated with LC

In this section we consider a PCF-design similar to the structure recently
investigated by Zografopoulos et al [4]. Where the possibility of changing the
ﬁber characteristics by applying an external electric ﬁeld was considered. The
structure has a cladding consisting of airholes placed in a triangular structure
and a core hole inﬁltrated with LC. A cross section of the considered structure
is shown in the inset in Fig. 7. A physical realization of such a structure will
require selective ﬁlling, which has recently been demonstrated[2, 3], where
selective ﬁlling was achieved by collapsing the small holes using a fusion
splicer, and then the holes with the larger radius were inﬁltrated. Here
we consider a structure where the inﬁltrated center hole has a radius twice
as large as the radius of the cladding holes. The pitch is 5/3 times the

radius of the central hole. Compared to the capillary tube studied in the
previous section this structure has a higher index contrast between the core
and cladding, because the presence of the airholes signiﬁcantly lowers the
eﬀective index of the cladding. Again we consider both the planar and axial
orientation of the LC in the center hole. In Fig. 7 the dispersion curves for
diﬀerent radii of the center hole are shown for the fundamental mode HE-
mode with the planar alignment of the LC. The ﬁber is multimoded for the
wavelengths considered here. We see that all the ﬁbers now have regions of
both normal and anomalous dispersion. The ﬁber with a center hole radius
of 0.75µm has two ZDWs at λ = 1.05µm and λ = 1.55µm. The ﬁbers with
center hole radii of 1.0µm and 1.5µm each have one ZDW at λ = 1.15µm and
λ = 1.3µm respectively. The dispersion curves for the axial alignment of the
LC are shown in Fig. 8. Like the capillary tube with the axial alignment,
the type of the fundamental mode is also dependent on the wavelength for
the PCF with the LC axially aligned. We see that the ﬁbers with center
hole radius 1.0µm and 1.5µm, now have large regions where the dispersion is
anomalous for the mode that resembles the TM01 mode of the single capillary
tube. For the mode that resembles the HE11-mode of the single capillary tube
the dispersion is purely normal for all the waveguide designs considered here.
The eﬀect of increasing the temperature is also investigated for this waveguide
In plots (c) and (d) in Fig. 6, we see again that the dispersion

increases with temperature.
In subplot (c) the dispersion proﬁles for the
PCFs with R = 0.75µm and R = 1.0µm are shown. The lower ZDW of
the ﬁber with R = 0.75µm can be tuned between 1.051µm at 25oC and
1.058µm at 50oC, while the higher ZDW can be tuned between 1.565µm and
1.571µm. The ﬁber with R = 1.0µm has one ZDW in the optical spectrum
which can be tuned between 1.128µm and 1.139µm. For the PCFs with the
axial alignment of the LC molecules we do not have anomalous dispersion
for the designs considered here. But the plots for for the axial alignment in
Fig. 6 indicates that the dispersion can be tuned in a broader interval for
this alignment.

4 Conclusion

An accurate method for calculating chromatic dispersion of anisotropic waveg-
uides is demonstrated. The method is based on a generalization of a pre-
viously presented method for isotropic waveguides. We have applied the

16

method to a simple step index ﬁber with an anisotropic LC core since this
problem has an analytical solution. Our results show that the method can
be applied to calculate chromatic dispersion curves that are consistent with
the exact result throughout the visible spectrum and into the near infrared
spectrum.
With the method we have studied chromatic dispersion of capillary tubes and
PCFs inﬁltrated with LC. The considered PCFs are all multimoded in the
wavelength intervals considered, while it is shown that single mode operation
is possible for the capillary tube inﬁltrated with LC molecules aligned in par-
allel. The tunability of the diﬀerent LC inﬁltrated waveguides is investigated
by calculating the chromatic dispersion at 25oC and at 50oC. For the two dif-
ferent alignments of the LC considered here, the tunability is highest for the
axial orientation, while the tunability for the planar orientation is weaker. A
waveguide design where the ZDWs can be tuned over approximately 10µm
is demonstrated.

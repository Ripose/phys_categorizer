We present an investigation of the modulational instability of partially coherent

signals in electrical transmission lines. Starting from the modiﬁed Ginzburg-Landau

equations and the Wigner-Moyal representation, we derive a nonlinear dispersion

relation for the modulational instability. It is found that the eﬀect of signal broad-

bandness reduces the growth rate of the modulational instability.

About a decade ago, Marquie et al. [1] and Bilbault et al. [2] investigated theoretically

and experimentally the nonlinear propagation of signals in electrical transmission lines.

Speciﬁcally, they considered a nonlinear network composed of a set of cells containing two

linear inductances in series and one in parallel, together with a nonlinear capacitance diode

in the shunt branch. It has been shown that the system of equations governing the physics

of this network can be reduced to a cubic nonlinear Schr¨odinger (CNS) equation or a pair

of coupled nonlinear Schr¨odinger (CNLS) equation. Both the CNS and the CNLS equations

admit modulational instability and the formation of envelope solitons, which have been

observed experimentally [1, 2].

Recently, Kengne and Liu [3] presented a model for wave propagation on a discrete elec-

trical transmission line based on the modiﬁed complex Ginzburg-Landau (MCGL) equation,

derived in the small amplitude and long wavelength limit using the standard reductive per-

turbation technique and complex expansion [4] on the governing nonlinear equations. The

MCGL is also referred to as the derivative nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation or the cubic-

quintic Ginzburg-Landau equation. Nonlinear soliton solutions of the MCGL equation have

2

been presented in Ref. [3].

In this Brief Report, we consider the modulational instabilities of partially coherent

electrical pulses that are governed by the MCGL equation [3]

i∂tu − P ∂2

xu − γu − Q1|u|4u − iQ2|u|2∂xu − iQ3∂x(|u|2u) = 0,

(1)

where P , Qj (j = 1, 2, 3), and γ are real transmission line parameters. We note that Eq. (1)
has the space independent harmonic solution u = u0 exp(−iΩ0t), where Ω0 = γ + Q1U 4
0 .

Next, we let u = [u0 + u1(t, x)] exp(−iΩ0t) in Eq. (1), where |u1| ≪ u0, and linearize

with respect to u1 to obtain

(2)

where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate. Separating the perturbation into its real

and imaginary parts, according to u1 = X + iY , and letting X, Y ∝ exp(iKx − iΩt), we

obtain from (2) the nonlinear dispersion relation

when P Q1 > 0. We see that the eﬀect of the derivative nonlinearity Q3 is to decrease the

instability region, while the higher order nonlinearity coeﬃcient Q1 tends to increase the

instability region. In Fig. 1, the typical structure of the modulational instability growth rate

is depicted.

In order to analyze the eﬀects due to partial coherence on the pulse propagation in

nonlinear electrical transmission lines, we next introduce the Wigner function, deﬁned as

the Fourier transform of the two-point correlation function [5]

ρ(t, x, k) =

dξ eikξhu∗(t, x + ξ/2)u(t, x − ξ/2)i,

where the angular bracket denotes the ensemble average [7]. The Wigner function deﬁnes a

generalized phase space distribution function for quasi-particles, which satisﬁes the relation

where I is the pulse intensity. Applying the time derivative on the deﬁnition (5) and using

the MCGL equation (1), we obtain [5, 6]

(7) describes the propagation of partially coherent pulses in nonlinear electrical transmission

lines.

We now analyze Eq. (7) for small perturbations, i.e. we let ρ(t, x, k) = ρ0(k)+ρ1 exp(iKx−

iΩt) and I(t, x) = I0 + I1 exp(iKx − iΩt), where |ρ1| ≪ ρ0 and |I1| ≪ I0. Linearizing Eq.

FIG. 1: The typical structure of the modulational instability growth rate Γ as a function of the

wavenumber K, as given by Eq. (4). The full curve has full coherence (∆ = 0), while the dashed

curve have a nonzero decoherence as given by the width ∆. The dotted curve has negative values

on the parameters Q2 and Q3 and Q2 = Q3/4, while ∆ is still ﬁnite, and the dashed-dotted curve

has Q3 = Q2/4 < 0 with a ﬁnite ∆.

where we have dropped the tilde on all variables, and ǫ = sgn(P ). In Fig. 1 we have plotted

the normalized growth rate Γ as a function of the normalized wavenumber K. We have

assumed that P < 0, i.e. ǫ = −1. When Q2 = Q3/4 = 1/2 and ∆ = 0, we obtain the full

curve in Fig. 1, while ∆ = 0.1 gives the dashed curve. For ∆ = 0.1, but Q2 = Q3/4 = −1/2,

we obtain the dotted curve in Fig. 1, and Q3 = Q2/4 = −1/2 gives the dashed-dotted curve.

When ǫ = 1, a reduced distribution width ∆ tend to increase the growth rate, which is

unphysical.

To summarize, we have examined the modulational instability of partially coherent pulses

in nonlinear electrical transmission lines. For this purpose, we have derived a nonlinear

dispersion relation from the MCGL equation by using the Wigner-Moyal representation.

The nonlinear dispersion relation is analyzed for a Lorentzian equilibrium pulse distribution

function. It is found that the growth rate of the modulational instability is reduced due to

5

the consideration of the broadband signals. The present results should help to understand

the nonlinear propagation of broadband pulses in electrical transmission lines.

TWO-FREQUENCY RADIATIVE TRANSFER AND ASYMPTOTIC
SOLUTION

ALBERT C. FANNJIANG

Abstract. Two-frequency radiative transfer (RT) theory is developed for classical waves
in random media. Depending on the ratio of the wavelength to the scale of medium ﬂuctu-
ation the two-frequency transport equation is either a Boltzmann-like integral equation or
a Fokker-Planck-like diﬀerential equation in the phase space. The two-frequency transport
equation is used to estimate three physical parameters: the spatial spread, the coherence
length and the Thouless frequency. A closed form solution is given in the paraxial regime
of geometrical radiative transfer (GRT) and shows highly nontrivial dependence of mutual
coherence on the spatial displacement and frequency diﬀerence.

1. Introduction

Let Uj, j = 1, 2, be the random, scalar wave ﬁeld of wavenumber kj, j = 1, 2, The mu-
tual coherence function and its cross-spectral version, known as the two-frequency mutual
coherence function, deﬁned by

The motivation for the scaling factors in (1) will be given below, cf. (3).

h·i

In this paper, we set out to analyze the two-frequency mutual coherence as function of the
spatial displacement and frequency diﬀerence for classical waves in multiply scattering media.
This problem has been extensively studied in the physics literature (see [2, 14, 19, 22, 23] and
references therein). Here we derive from the multscale expansion the two-frequency version of
the radiative transfer equation which is then used to estimate qualitaviely the three physical
parameters: the spatial and spatial frequency spreads, and the coherence bandwidth, also
known as the Thouless frequency. Moreover, we show that the two-frequency radiative
transfer equation is analytically solvable in the paraxial regime of geometrical radiative
transfer (GRT). The closed form solution (37) provides detailed information of the two-
frequency mutual coherence beyond the current physical picture [19, 23].

To this end, we introduce the two-frequency Wigner distribution which is equivalent to the
two-frequency mutual coherence and is a natural extension of the standard Wigner distribu-
tion widely used in optics [11]. A diﬀerent version of two-frequency Wigner distribution for
parabolic waves was introduced earlier [7] and with it the corresponding radiative transfer
equation has been derived with full mathematical rigor [10]. The rigorous two-frequency
radiative transfer theory for parabolic waves turns out to be the paraxial approximation of

the theory for classical waves developed here, lending further support to the validity of the
latter.

The main diﬀerence between the two-frequency radiative transfer and the standard theory
is that the former retains the wave coherence and is not just transport of wave energy density.

where fj is the source term, µj and Vj are respectively the mean and ﬂuctuation of the
refractive index associated with the wavenumber kj and are in general complex-valued. The
imaginary part of Vj (i.e. the ﬂuctuation of absorption coeﬃcient) is related to its real part
through the Kramer-Kr¨onig relation. Here and below the wave speed is set to be unity. To
solve (2) one needs also some boundary condition which is assumed to be at the far ﬁeld
(i.e.

is just the (partial) Fourier transform of the mutual coherence function (1). In view

distribution deﬁned here has a diﬀerent scaling from the one introduced for the parabolic
waves [7].

The purpose of introducing the two-frequency Wigner distribution is to develop a two-
frequency theory in analogy to the well studied standard theory of radiative transfer. Al-
though the deﬁnition (3) requires the domain to be Rd, the governing equation for

An important regime of multiple scattering of classical waves takes place when the scale
of medium ﬂuctuation is much smaller than the propagation distance but is comparable or
much larger than the wavelength [14, 16]. Radiative transfer regime is equivalent to the
scaling limit which replaces µj + Vj in eq. (2) with

being the ratio of the wavelength to the scale of medium ﬂuctuation. The resulting medium

converges to a spatial white-noise in three dimensions.

Physically the radiative transfer scaling belongs to the diﬀusive wave regime under the
condition of a large dimensionless conductance g = Nℓt/L, where ℓt is the transport mean
free path, L is the sample size in the direction of propagation and N = 2πA/λ2 is the number
of transverse modes, limited by the illuminated area A and the wavelength of radiation λ,
[2, 19]. The dimensionless conductance g can be expressed as g = kℓtθ with the Fresnel
number θ = A/(λL). With the scaling (11), kℓt ∼

3.1. Two-frequency geometrical optics. Before we proceed, let us pause to discuss the
geometrical optics limit which will bring (12) into a more familiar form. The geometrical
optics regime corresponds to the vanishing ratio γ of the wavelength to the scale of medium
ﬂuctuation while ε > 0 is held ﬁxed.

To this end, the conditions (13) and (14) for the frequency range need to be modiﬁed

analogously:

3.2. Multi-scale expansion (MSE). To derive the radiative transfer equation for the
two-frequency Wigner distribution we employ the multi-scale expansion (MSE) [1, 17]. MSE
begins with introducing the fast variable

˜x = x/ε

and treating ˜x as independent from the slow variable x. Consequently the derivative p
consists of two terms

· ∇

(19)

p

· ∇

= p

· ∇

x + ε−1p

· ∇˜x.

Then MSE posits the following asymptotic expansion:

(20)

W (x, p) = ¯W (x, ˜x, p) + √εW1(x, ˜x, p) + εW2(x, ˜x, p) + O(ε3/2),

˜x = xε−1

whose proper sense will be explained in the Appendix.

Substituting the ansatz into eq. (12) and using (19) we determine each term of (20) by

equating terms of the same order of magnitude starting with the highest order ε−1.

The ε−1-order equation has one term:

· ∇˜x ¯W = 0
which can be solved by setting ¯W = ¯W (x, p). Namely, to the leading order W is independent
of the fast variable.

The δ-function in the scattering kernel is a result of elastic scattering which preserve the
wavenumber. When β = 0 (then iµ′
the imaginary part of µ1), eq. (24) reduce to the
standard form of radiative transfer equation for the phase space energy density [18, 13, 4, 16].
For β > 0, the wave featue is retained in (24). When β
, the ﬁrst term on the right
hand side of (24) drops out, due to rapid phase ﬂuctuation, so the random scattering eﬀect
is pure damping.

media the paraxial approximation is widely used. Let us assume that the wave propagates
mainly in the z direction. Let p and p⊥ denote the longitudinal and transverse components

6. Discussion and conclusion

At least two approaches to the derivation of the standard (one-frequency) radiative transfer
equation from the wave equation exist in the literature: the diagrammatic expansion method
[22, 16] and the multi-scale expansion method advocated here [1]. The latter is considerably
simpler than the former in terms of the amount of calculation involved. Both approaches
have been developed with full mathematical rigor in some special cases (see [8] and the refer-
ences therein). With the framework of the multi-scale expansion the two-frequency radiative
transfer equation can be rigorously derived for the one-sided boundary value problem of the
paraxial wave equation by using the so called martingale method in probability theory [10].
The martingale method is unfortunately not applicable to the general (two-sided) boundary
value problem such as (2).

On the other hand, the two-frequency radiative transfer limit for (2) may be dealt with
by extending the diagrammatic method developed for the time dependent Schr¨odinger equa-
tion [20, 21, 12, 5]. By analogy, (2) is like the stationary Schr¨odinger equation with an
energy-dependent potential. However, the diagrammatic approach, rigorous or not, is more
complicated than MSE to carry out, so, in addition to the formal expansion, we will be
content to give a brief analysis of MSE in the Appendix.

Using MSE we have given a formal derivation of the two-frequency radiative transfer equa-
tion for the classical wave equation in terms of the new two-frequency Wigner distribution.
The validity of the derivation is supported by the interchangeability of the paraxial approx-
imation and the two-frequency radiative transfer limit. A main feature of the two-frequency
radiative transfer equation is that it retains some wave character.

By dimensional analysis with the two-frequency radiative transfer equation, we obtain the
qualitative behavior of the spatial spread, the spatial frequency spread and the coherent
bandwidth.
In the paraxial regime of GRT, we obtain a closed form solution, revealing
highly non-trivial structure of the two-frequency mutual coherence function.

The present approach can be generalized to the polarized waves described by the Maxwell

equations or the vector wave equation, which will be presented elsewhere.

which is positive in general. In order to maintain the soundness of (20) the error caused by
the regularization √εηW η
1 must be O(ε). In view of the above calculation (38), it follows
that η must be of the same order of magnitude as ε or smaller.

Now, with η = ε, the same calculation (38) also implies that the corrector term in (20)

In summary, the multi-scale expansion (20) is to be understood in the sense of (38), i.e.
strongly in x but weakly in p in the mean-square sense. This is physically reasonable as p
corresponds to the scale of ﬂuctuation compatible with that of the refractive index.

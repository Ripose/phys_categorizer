Abstract

Kramers-Kr¨onig (K-K) analysis of harmonic generation optical data is usually greatly
limited by the technical inability to measure data over a wide spectral range. Data
inversion for real and imaginary part of χn(nω; ω, ..., ω) can be more eﬃciently per-
formed if the knowledge of one of the two parts of the susceptibility in a ﬁnite
spectral range is supplemented with a single measurement of the other part for a
given frequency. Then it is possible to perform data inversion using only measured
data and subtractive K-K relations. In this paper multiply subtractive K-K relations
are, for the ﬁrst time, presented for the nonlinear harmonic generation susceptibili-
ties. The applicability of the singly subtractive K-K relations are shown using data
for third-order harmonic generation susceptibility of polysilane.

1 Introduction

In linear optics Kramers-Kr¨onig (K-K) relations and sum rules for linear sus-
ceptibility, χ(1)(ω), constitute well-established tools of fundamental impor-
tance in the analysis of linear optical data, since they relate refractive and ab-
sorptive phenomena and provide the possibility to check the self-consistency of
experimental or model-generated data [1,2,3,4]. The foundation of these fun-
damental integral relations lies in the principle of causality in the response of
the matter to the external radiation, the conceptual bridge being established
by the Titchmarsh’s theorem [5].

Much eﬀort has been placed in a very wide and detailed theoretical and exper-
imental investigation of nonlinear optical processes due to their huge scientiﬁc

and technological relevance. Apart from results relative to speciﬁc cases [6,7,8],
a more modern approach to the problem of framing in a coherent and general
fashion dispersion theory of the nonlinear susceptibilities has started recently
dating back to the late 1980s [9,10] and early 1990s [11,12,13].

In the case of harmonic wave generation, which is probably the single most
representative process of all the nonlinear optical phenomena, only recently
a complete formulation of general K-K relations and sum rules for nth or-
der harmonic generation susceptibility χ(n)(nω; ω, · · · , ω) has been obtained
[14,15,16]. Unfortunately, even now there are relatively few studies that report
on independent measurements of the real and imaginary parts of the harmonic
generation susceptibilities [17,18], and on the validity of K-K relations in non-
linear experimental data inversion [19].

Characteristic integral structure of K-K relations requires the knowledge of the
spectrum at a semi-inﬁnite angular frequency range. Unfortunately, in prac-
tical spectroscopy only ﬁnite spectral range can be measured. The technical
problem to measure nonlinear optical spectrum at relatively wide energy range
is probably the single most important reason why experimental research in this
ﬁeld has been depressed for a long time. Fortunately, recent development of
dye lasers is very promising. However, at the moment such lasers seem to have
relevance in nonlinear optical spectroscopy for relatively low order nonlinear
processes.

In the context of linear optics singly [20] (SSKK) and multiply [21] subtractive
Kramers-Kr¨onig (MSKK) relations have been proposed in order to relax the
limitations due to ﬁnite-range data. As far as we know, they have never been
proposed for nonlinear susceptibilities and especially for harmonic generation
susceptibilities. The idea behind the subtractive Kramers-Kr¨onig technique
is that the inversion of the real (imaginary) part of χ(n)(nω; ω, · · · , ω) can be
greatly improved if we have one or more anchor points, i.e. a single or multiple
measurement of the imaginary (real) part for a set of frequencies. In such a
case we give general expressions for multiply subtractive K-K relations having
a faster convergence, thus decreasing the error due to the inevitable ﬁnite
spectral range.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give the expressions for
multiply subtractive K-K relations for χ(n)(nω; ω, · · · , ω) and in Section 3 we
present application of SSKK on experimental data of third-order harmonic
generation susceptibility of polysilane. Finally, in Section 4 we set our conclu-
sions.

2 Multiply subtractive K-K relations for χ(n)(nω; ω, ..., ω)

The analysis of the holomorphic [2] properties of the nth order harmonic gen-
eration susceptibility, which intrinsically derive from the principle of causality
in the nonlinear response function of the matter [22], allows the derivation of
the following Hilbert transform [11]:

ıπχ(n)(nω′; ω′, · · · , ω′) = ℘

where ℘ indicates the Cauchy principal part integration. With the aid of the
symmetry relation

χ(n)(nω; ω, · · · , ω) = [χ(n)(−nω; −ω, · · · , −ω)]∗

(2)

with (∗) denoting the complex conjugation, we obtain the following K-K rela-
tions for the real and imaginary parts:

where, for the sake of clarity, we denote χ(n)(nω; ω, · · · , ω) simply by χ(n)(nω).
The independent dispersion relation (3) in principle allows us to compute
the real part of the susceptibility once we know the imaginary part for all
frequencies and vice versa.

Palmer et al. [21] have studied multiply subtractive K-K analysis in the case
of phase retrieval problems related to linear reﬂection spectroscopy. Here their
results are generalized to hold for holomorphic nonlinear susceptibilities. Un-
fortunately, Palmer et al. [21] presented MSKK only for the phase angle (imag-
inary part of the linear reﬂectance). Here we extend their theory to hold both
for the real and imaginary parts of the arbitrary-order harmonic generation
susceptibility. With the aid of mathematical induction (see appendix A in ref.
[21]) we can derive the multiply subtractive K-K relation for the real and

Here ωj with j = 1, · · · , Q denote the anchor points. Note that the anchor
points in Eqs. (5) and (6) need not to be the same. We observe that the
integrands of Eqs. (5) and (6) have remarkably faster asymptotic decrease, as
a function of angular frequency, than the conventional K-K relations given by
Eqs. (3) and (4). This can be observed by comparing the integrands of K-K and
MSKK relations since the convergence of Q-times subtracted K-K relations is
proportional to ω−(2n+2+2Q) whereas the conventional K-K relations decrease
proportional to ω−(2n+2). Therefore, it is expected that the limitations related
to the presence of an experimentally unavoidable ﬁnite frequency range are
thus relaxed, and the precision of the integral inversions is then enhanced.

Before proceeding we wish to remark that MSKK relations can also be written
for all the moments ω′2α[χ(n)(nω′; ω′, ..., ω′)]k with 0 ≤ α ≤ k(n + 1), where
α and k are integers. Such functions play an important role in the context of
sum rules for arbitrary-order harmonic generation susceptibilities [14,15,16].

Palmer et al. [21] discussed how the anchor points should be chosen inside
the measured spectral range. It is well known that Chebyshev polynomials
have great importance in minimizing errors in numerical computations [23].

4

According to Palmer et al. [21] accurate data inversion is possible when the
anchor points are chosen near to the zeros of the Qth order Chebyshev poly-
nomial of the ﬁrst kind. In linear optical spectroscopy it is usually easy to
get information of the optical constants at various anchor points. However,
in the ﬁeld of nonlinear optics it is diﬃcult to obtain the real and imaginary
parts of the nonlinear susceptibility at various anchor points. Therefore, in the
present study we wish to emphasize that even a single anchor point reduces
the errors caused by ﬁnite spectral range in data inversion of nonlinear optical
data. Then the choice of the location of the anchor point is not critical as con-
cerns the coincidence of the zero of the Chebyshev polynomial. Furthermore,
the Chebyshev zeros accumulate at the ends of the data interval. This is the
reason why the anchor point is chosen near to one end of the data interval.
For one anchor point, say at frequency ω1, we obtain from Eqs. (5) and (6)
the following singly subtractive K-K relations

3 Application of singly subtractive K-K relations to experimental

data of χ(3)(3ω; ω, ω, ω) on polysilane

Here we apply singly subtractive K-K relations for real data, in order to
prove their eﬀective relevance. We consider the experimental values of the
real and imaginary part of the nonlinear susceptibility of third-order har-
monic wave generation on polysilane, obtained by Kishida et al. [19]; for both
ℜ{χ(3)(3ω; ω, ω, ω)} and ℑ{χ(3)(3ω; ω, ω, ω)}, which come from independent
measurements, the energy range is 0.4 − 2.5 eV.

First we consider only data ranging from 0.9 to 1.4 eV, in order to simulate a
low-data availability scenario, and compare the quality of the data inversion
obtained with the conventional K-K and SSKK relations within this energy
range. This interval constitutes a good test since it contains the most rele-
vant feature of both parts of the susceptibility. However, a lot of the spectral

5

structure is left outside the interval and the asymptotic behavior is not estab-
lished for either parts. Therefore, no plain optimal conditions for optical data
inversion are established.

In Fig. 1 we show the results obtained for the real part of the third-order
harmonic generation susceptibility. The solid line in Fig. 1 represents the ex-
perimental data. The dashed curve in Fig. 1, which was calculated by using
conventional K-K relation by truncating integration of (3) consistently gives
a poor match with the actual line. On the contrary, we obtain a better agree-
ment with a single anchor point located at ω1 = 0.9 eV, which is represented
by dotted line in Fig. 1. SSKK and measured data for the real part of the
susceptibility are almost undistinguishable up to 1.3 eV.

In Fig. 2 similar calculations as above are shown but for the imaginary part
of the nonlinear susceptibility. In this case the anchor point is located at
ω1 = 1 eV. From Fig. 2 we observe that the precision of the data inversion is
dramatically better by using SSKK instead of the conventional K-K relations.
The presence of the anchor point greatly reduces the errors of the estimation
performed with the conventional K-K relations in the energy range 0.9 − 1.4
eV.

4 Conclusions

The extrapolations in K-K analysis, such as the estimation of the data beyond
the measured spectral range, can be a serious source of errors [24,25]. Recently,
King [26] presented an eﬃcient numerical approach to the evaluation of K-K
relations. Nevertheless, the problem of data ﬁtting is always present in regions
outside the measured range.

In this paper we proposed how an independent measurement of the unknown
part of the complex third-order nonlinear susceptibility for a given frequency
relaxes the limitations imposed by the ﬁniteness of the measured spectral
range, since in the obtained SSKK relations faster asymptotic decreasing in-
tegrands are present. SSKK relations can provide a reliable data inversion
procedure based on using measured data only. We demonstrated that SSKK
relations yield more precise data inversion, using only a single anchor point,
than conventional K-K relations.

Naturally it is possible to exploit also MSKK if higher precision is required.
However, the measurement of multiple anchor may be experimentally tedious.
Finally, we remark that MSKK relations are valid for all holomorphic nonlinear
susceptibilities of arbitrary-order. As an example of such holomorphic third-
order nonlinear susceptibilities we mention those related to pump and probe

6

nonlinear processes (see details of the various expressions in Ref. [27]). Un-
fortunately, the degenerate arbitrary-order nonlinear susceptibility is a mero-
morphic function [28] and MSKK cannot be applied.

sured optical data on polysilane. One of the authors (JJS) wishes to thank

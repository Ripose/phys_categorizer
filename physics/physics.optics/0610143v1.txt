We present elementary proof on reciprocal optical responses concerning transmittance and re-
ﬂectance. The proof is direct, simple, and nevertheless true for the diverse objects which can be
absorptive and can induce diﬀraction and scattering, as long as the objects respond linearly and
locally to electromagnetic waves. This article enables those who understand the basics of classical
electromagnetics to grasp the physical basis of reciprocal optical response, including the limitation,
without further theoretical knowledge on the solution of diﬀerential equations and on the formalism
of scattering matrix.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Reciprocity, which was ﬁrst found by Lorentz at the
end of 19th century, has long history1 and has been de-
rived in several formalisms so far. There are two recip-
rocal conﬁgurations in optical responses as shown in Fig.
1: For the conﬁguration in Fig. 1(a), the transmissive
reciprocal conﬁguration is Fig. 1(b) and the reﬂective re-
ciprocal one is Fig. 1(c). Reciprocity on transmission
means the relation of Tk = T−k, and that on reﬂection
is expressed as Rθ = R−θ. Though your intuition may
get you believe that Rθ 6= R−θ at a glance, reciprocity
tells you that the optical responses are beyond primitive
imagination. Indeed, most of students show a surprise
when they know the fact for the ﬁrst time. The recip-
rocal conﬁgurations are obtained by making symmetric
operation for the incident light of the wavenumber vec-
tor: (kx, kz) → (−kx, −kz) or (−kx, kz). Reciprocal
optical responses are thus connected to the geometrical
symmetry and are apparently independent of details on
objects.

Since 1950s, sophisticated study exploiting scattering
matrix (S-matrix) became standard. In the theoretical
study using S-matrix, it is usually assumed that there
is no absorption in the object. The assumption derives
the unitarity of S-matrix and makes it possible to prove
reciprocity.

Among the various reports to date, the most general
proof was published by Petit in 1980;2 reciprocal reﬂec-
tion as shown in Fig. 1 is derived for asymmetric gratings
such as echelette grating. On the basis of the reciprocal
relation concerning the solutions of Helmholtz equation,
the proof showed that reciprocal reﬂection is true for pe-
riodic objects irrespective of absorption, though it seems
diﬃcult to apply the proof to transmission. Thus, recip-
rocal optical response has already been known in reﬂec-
tion conﬁguration and even in absorptive media. There

exist not a few other literature on reciprocal optical re-
sponses, and the history has been reviewed in Ref. 1.

In this article, we present a simple, direct, and gen-
eral derivation on reciprocal optical responses concern-
ing transmission and reﬂection only relying on classical
electrodynamics. It is, to our best knowledge, the sim-
plest and most general proof and is therefore understood
without diﬃculty even by undergraduate students. More-
over, the limitation and breaking of reciprocal optical re-
sponses are discussed.

II. RECIPROCAL THEOREM

such as statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and

electromagnetics.3 We introduce the theorem on electro-
magnetics here. As is well known,4 when current j1 and
charge ρ1 exist, the retarded vector potential A1 and
scalar potential φ1 in vacuum are given by

where t′ = t − |r − r′|/c, ε0 is permittivity and µ0 is
permeability. The induced electric ﬁeld E1 is obtained
by E1 = −∂A1/∂t − ∇φ1 and the induced magnetic ﬁeld
B1 is derived by B1 = ∇ × A1.

induced electromagnetic waves travel in linear and locally

j µi,jHj(r), then next equation holds:

This is the reciprocal theorem in electromagnetics; the
proof shown in Ref. 3 exploits plane wave and is straight-
forward. Since the integrands take non-zero values only
on currents, the theorem indicates that there exists the
relation between source of electromagnetic wave (namely,
current ji) and observed electric ﬁeld Ej on the source
(i 6= j and i, j = 1, 2). Note that Ej is generated by
another distant current jj.

III. RECIPROCAL OPTICAL RESPONSES

In this section, we apply the reciprocal theorem to op-
tical responses both in transmission and reﬂection con-
ﬁgurations. Explicit descrptions are as follows.

As is widely known, an electric dipole oscillating at the
frequency ω emits dipole radiation which is detected as
far ﬁeld. When a small dipole p along z axis is set at the
origin of coordinate, it is written as p(t) = p(t)ez oscil-
lating as p(t) = p0eiωt emits radiation, which is written

where the polar coordinate (r, θ, φ) is used, eθ =
(cos θ cos φ, cos θ sin φ, − sin θ), and t′ = t − r/c. Since
dipole p is deﬁned by p(r, t) =
rρ(r, t)dr and the
equation for conservation of charge density is given by
∇ · j + ∂ρ/∂t = 0, we obtain the current j associated with
the dipole p:

R

j(r, t) = ˙p(t)δ(r)ez.

Let us think of two arrays of N dipoles (long enough
but ﬁnite) in xz plane as shown in Fig. 3. The two ar-
rays have same length, and the directions are speciﬁed by
normalized vectors li (i = 1, 2) and l1 k l2. If the dipoles
coherently oscillate at the same phase, then the emitted
electric ﬁelds are superimposed and form wave front at
position by far distance from the array in xz plane as
drawn in Fig. 3. In this case, due to Eq. (5) the current
is ji k li. The electric vector of wave front, Ei,in, satisﬁes
Ei,in k li as seen in Eq. (4) and travels with wavenumber
vector ki,in and is regarded as a slowly decaying plane
wave in xz plane. Thus, when we put the dipole arrays
distant enough from the object, the induced electromag-
netic waves become incident plane wave to the object in
a good approximation in xz plane. The arrays of dipoles
have to be long enough to form the plane wave.

Under the transmission conﬁguration, we calculate
ji · Ejdr (i, j = 1, 2 and i 6= j). A typical transmissive

Currents ji yield electric ﬁelds Ei,in (i = 1, 2).

conﬁguration is drawn in Fig. 3. Current ji is composed
of a straight array of N small dipoles p. The array is set
along the vector li perpendicular to ki,in; then, li ⊥ ki,in
and li k ji. It is generally convenient to expand electric
ﬁeld with Fourier series in the calculation for periodic
objects:

E(r) =

E(n) exp(ikn · r),

where kn = (kx,n, 0, kz,n) = (kin,x + 2πn/dx, 0, kz,n),
(n = 0, ±1, ±2, · · · ) and dx is the periodicity of object
along x axis. The z component is expressed in homoge-
x,n where

neous media like vacuum as kz,n = ±
the signs correspond to the directions against z axis.

After these preparations for notations, the aimed cal-

culation is executed as follows.

To ensure the integration results in δn,0, the array of
dipoles has to be longer than L:

L = (length of dipole) × m

where m is the least common multiple of diﬀraction order
open at the frequency ω. This condition would be usually
satisﬁed when Ei,in forms wave front of plane wave. The
E(0)
is the intensity of transmitted ﬁeld observed on the
2
current j1.

By permutating 1 and 2 in Eq. (6), the reciprocal the-

orem of Eq. (3) gives

1 = E(0)

similar relation holes:

The feature of the proof on T1 = T2 is independent
of detailed evaluation of E(0)
, and therefore makes the
i
proof simple and general. The proof can be obviously
extended to two-dimensional structures by replacing the
one-dimensional structures in Figs. 3 and 4. Though we
deal with an example of periodic object, the proof can
be also extended to non-periodic objects. Reciprocity on
transmission thus holds irrespective of absorption and
diﬀraction, scattering of objects.

In Fig. 3, the induced electric ﬁelds Ei have the po-
larization in xz plane. The polarization is called TM
polarization in the terminology of waveguide theory and
also often called p polarization. As for TE polarization
(which is often called s polarization) under which the Ei
have the polarization parallel to y axis, the proof is sim-
ilar to that described above except that dipoles are set
along y axis.

Reciprocal reﬂection is also shown in a similar way.
The conﬁguration is depicted in Fig. 4. The two sources
are set in mirror symmetric for z axis. Direct calculation
ji · Ejdr leads to reciprocal relation on reﬂectance
for
of R1 = R2.

IV. NUMERICAL AND EXPERIMANTAL
CONFIRMATION

A real example of reciprocal optical responses are
shown here. Figure 5(a) displays the structure described
in this section and reciprocal transmissive conﬁguration.
The object consists of periodic grooves etched in quartz
substrate, followed by deposition of gold ﬁlm. The struc-
ture is prominently asymmetric as for z axis. The proﬁle
was obtained from the AFM image of the fabricated sam-
ple.

Figure 5(b) shows numerical results for the object. In-
cident light slightly tilts from normal incidence. Nu-
merical calculation was carried out with the S-matrix
method6 improved in convergence5; permittivity of gold
was taken from literature7 and that of quartz is 2.1316.
The result indicates that transmission spectra (lower
solid line in each panel) are same under the reciprocal
conﬁgurations, while reﬂection (upper solid line) and ab-
sorption (dotted line) spectra present deﬁnite discrep-
ancy.
It means that surface excitations are diﬀerent
at both sides and absorb photons at diﬀerent amount;
nonetheless, transmission spectra are the same under in-
cidence of k1,in and k2,in.

Experimental transmission spectra are in reasonably
good agreement with the calculated transmission spectra
in shape and support the reciprocity on transmission.

V. A FEW REMARKS AND SUMMARY

As described in Sec. II, the reciprocal theorem assumed
that all medias are linear and show local response. The
assumption implies the limitation for reciprocal optical
responses. In purely logical sense, the reciprocal theorem
could be broken under nonlinear or nonlocally respond-
ing media.

We mention here a report on nonreciprocal response,8
in which explicit diﬀerence of transmittance is reported
in reciprocal conﬁguration as in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). It
takes place in a nonlinear optical crystal of KNbO3:Mn.
The values of tranmittance deviate by a few tens of per-
cents in reciprocal conﬁgurations. The crystal has sec-
j εi,jEj(r) +
ond order responses such that Di(r) =
j,k εi,j,kEj(r)Ek(r). The breaking of reciprocity comes

P

from the nonlinearlity.
P

Once we refer to an example of the breaking of reci-
procity due to nonlinearity, another interest would be
provoked: Does reciprocity also break in nonlocal me-
dia? In the nonlocal media, induction D is given by
ε(r, r′)E(r′)dr′. General proof for this problem
D(r) =
has not been reported to our knowledge. In the simpli-
ﬁed system of a stratiﬁed structure composed of nonlocal
media, it was proved that reciprocity holds.9

R

In summary, we presented elementary and heuristic
proof on reciprocal theorem which holds between current
and the induced electric ﬁeld. It is certainly relevant to
call the relation of T1 = T2 and R1 = R2 reciprocity as for
transmission and reﬂection, respectively. In addition, the
validity of reciprocal optical responses has been described
in accordance with the assumption of reciprocal theorem.

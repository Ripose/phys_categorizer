We suggest a method for controlling nonlinear switching in arrays of weakly

coupled optical waveguides, and demonstrate the digitized switching of a

narrow input beam for up to seven waveguides by means of the engineered

Peierls-Nabarro potential.

Discrete optical solitons were ﬁrst suggested theoretically as stationary nonlinear

localized modes of a periodic array of weakly coupled optical waveguides.1 Because

the use of discrete solitons promises an eﬃcient way to control multi-port nonlinear

switching in a system of many coupled waveguides, this ﬁeld has been extensively

explored during the last ten years in a number of theoretical papers (see, e.g., Refs.2, 3, 4

as an example). More importantly, the discrete solitons have also been generated

experimentally in fabricated periodic waveguide structures.5, 6

The most common theoretical approach to study the discrete optical solitons in

waveguide arrays is based on the decomposition of the electric ﬁeld in the periodic

structure into a sum of weakly coupled fundamental modes excited in each waveguide

of the array; a similar approach is known in solid-state physics as the tight-binding

approximation. According to this approach, the wave dynamics can be described by

an eﬀective discrete nonlinear Schr¨odinger (DNLS) equation, that possesses spatially

localized stationary solutions in the form of localized modes of a lattice model. Many

properties of the discrete optical solitons can be analyzed in the framework of the

DNLS equation.1, 4

One of the major problems for achieving the controllable multi-port steering of

discrete optical solitons in waveguide arrays is the existence of an eﬀective periodic

Peierls-Nabarro (PN) potential which appears due to the lattice discreteness. As a

consequence of this potential, a narrow large-amplitude discrete soliton does not prop-

agate in the lattice and it becomes trapped by the array. Several ideas to exploit the

discreteness properties of the array for the optical switching were suggested,7, 8 in-

cluding the demonstration of the output channel selection for the multi-port devices.

2

However, the soliton steering and switching is well controlled only in the limit of broad

beams whereas the soliton dynamics in highly discrete arrays has been shown to be

more complicated.8 In this Letter, we suggest to exploit the array discreteness by

applying the Peierls-Nabarro engineering approach, and demonstrate how to achieve

highly controllable multi-port soliton switching in the arrays by a desired integer

number of waveguides, the so-called “digital soliton switching”.

We consider a standard model of the waveguide arrays with a modulated coupling

described by the normalized DNLS equation of the form,9

dun
dz

+ Vn+1un+1 + Vn−1un−1 + γ

2un = 0,

(1)

where un is the eﬀective envelope of the electric ﬁeld in the n-th waveguide, the

normalized parameter Vn is proportional to the propagation constant of the n-th

waveguide and it characterizes the coupling between the neighboring waveguides,

and z is the propagation distance. The parameter γ = ω0n2/(cAeﬀ) is the eﬀective

waveguide nonlinearity associated with the Kerr nonlinearity of the core material.

The steering and trapping of discrete solitons in the framework of the model (1)

have been analyzed in many studies. Being kicked by an external force, the discrete

soliton can propagate through the eﬀective PN potential of the lattice for some dis-

tance, but then it gets trapped by the lattice due to the discreteness eﬀects. For a

larger force, the output soliton position ﬂuctuates between two (or more) neighbor-

ing waveguides making the switching uncontrollable.8 Here, we suggest to modulate

the waveguide coupling in order to achieve a controllable output and to engineer the

switching results. The key idea is to break a symmetry between the beam motion to

3

the right and left at the moment of trapping, in order to eliminate the chaotic trap-

ping observed in homogeneous arrays. In this way, we achieve a controllable digitized

switching where the continuous change of the input beam amplitude results in a

quantized displacement of the output beam by an integer number of waveguides.

We have tested diﬀerent types of modulation in the array parameters and the

corresponding structures of array super-lattices. An example of one of the optimized

structures is shown in Fig. , where we modulate the coupling parameter Vn in a

step-like manner. We also notice that the use of a linear rump potential (e.g. of the

form Vn = an) for these purpose does not lead to an eﬀective switching but, instead,

it makes the soliton switching even more chaotic due to the phenomenon of Bloch

oscillations which become randomized in the nonlinear regime.

Unlike many other studies, we select the input proﬁle in the form of a narrow

sech-like beam localized on a few waveguides only,

un(0) = A sech[A(n

nc)/√2] e−ik(n−nc),

(2)

for n

nc = 0,

1, and un = 0, otherwise. For the particular results presented below,

−

we select the array of 101 waveguides and place the beam at the middle position,

nc = 50. The maximum normalized propagation distance used in our simulations is

zmax = 45.

Parameter k in the ansatz (2) has the meaning of the transverse steering velocity

of the beam, in analogy with the continuous approximation. It describes the value

of an eﬀective kick of the beam in the transversal direction at the input, in order

to achieve the beam motion and shift into one of the neighboring (or other desired)

4

waveguide outputs.

In our simulations, we control the numerical accuracy by monitoring two con-

served quantities of the model, the soliton power P =

The input condition (2) is not an exact stationary solution of the discrete equation

(1) even for k = 0, and as the input kick (k

= 0) forces the soliton to move to the right

(k < 0) or left (k > 0), the motion is accompanied by some radiation. The eﬀective

lattice discreteness can be attributed to an eﬀective periodic PN potential which is

dynamic and changes in time. Due to both the strong radiation emission and the PN

barrier which should be overtaken in order to move the beam, the discrete soliton

gets trapped at one of the waveguides in the array, as shown in Fig. . In most cases,

the shift of the beam position to the neighboring waveguide is easy to achieve, as

shown in many studies.8 However, the soliton switching becomes rather complicated

and even chaotic provided the kicking force becomes stronger.

We have studied many diﬀerent regimes of the soliton multi-port switching in the

array and revealed that the most eﬀective switching in a desired waveguide position

(i.e. desired output) can be achieved by varying the coupling between waveguides

through the eﬀective propagation constant, as shown in Fig. . In this case, the se-

lection of a ﬁnite value of the steering parameter k allows to switch the whole beam

into a neighboring waveguide, as shown in Fig. , with only small amount of radi-

ation. Decreasing the amplitude of the input pulse at a ﬁxed value of the steering

parameter, ﬁxed to be say k =

1, it is possible to achieve self-trapping of the soliton

±

beam at some (short) distance from the initial center at diﬀerent waveguide position.

Due to step-like modulated coupling, we create a selection between the beam motion

to the right and left at the moment of trapping thus suppressing or eliminating the

chaotic trapping observed in homogeneous waveguide arrays. In this way, we achieve

a controllable digitized nonlinear switching where the continuous change of the am-

plitude of the input beam results in a quantized displacement of the output beam by

an integer number of waveguides. Consequently, for the parameters discussed above

we observe almost undistorted switching up to seven waveguides, and Fig. shows an

example of the digital soliton switching to the seventh waveguide.10

Figure gives a summary of the results for the parameters discussed above; it

shows the discrete position of the soliton at the output as a function of the input

beam amplitude, for two ﬁxed values of the steering parameter k =

1. In a remark-

±

able contrast with other studies (see, e.g., Ref.8), the coupling modulation allows to

achieve a controllable digitized switching in the array with very little or no distor-

tion. Additionally, we observe a slight asymmetry associated with a diﬀerence for the

discrete soliton to move uphill or downhill along the averaged slope of the coupling

parameter.

If we were to use ﬁve guides instead of three, one could expect a smaller amount of

radiation emitted. However, this would imply a longer distance before the beam gets

trapped by one of the waveguides in the array due to the eﬀective Peierls-Nabarro

potential. Also, this means that one could in principle switch the soliton beam to

any desired waveguide in the waveguide array, no matter how far; it would be just

a matter of choosing an initial beam wide enough, i.e., closer to the continuum (in

addition to optimize the coupling in a step-wise manner) by removing the random

6

selection between the directions and suppressing the beam random switching.

Another observation is that the sech-like initial proﬁle is not really fundamen-

tal. A (kicked) nonlinear impurity-like proﬁle of the form un(0) = A[(1

A2)/(1 +

−

A2)]|n−nc|/2 exp[

ik(n

nc)] will also show similar behavior, as our additional com-

−

−

putations show. The reason for this behavior seems to rest on the observation that,

for any system with local nonlinearity, a narrow initial proﬁle, will render the system

into an eﬀective linear one containing a small nonlinear cluster (or even a single site);

the bound state will therefore strongly resemble the one corresponding to a nonlinear

impurity.11

In conclusion, we have suggested a novel approach to achieve a digitized switching

in waveguide arrays by using the concept of discrete optical solitons. Our approach

involves a weak step-like modulation of the coupling strength (or, equivalently, dis-

tance between the waveguides) in the arrays with the period larger than the waveg-

uide spacing. Such a super-lattice structure allows to modify the trapping properties

of the waveguide array due to discreteness and engineer the strength of the eﬀective

trapping Peierls-Nabarro potential arising due to the lattice discreteness. We have

demonstrated numerically the controlled switching between up to seven waveguides

in the arrays by using very narrow input beams localized on three waveguides only.

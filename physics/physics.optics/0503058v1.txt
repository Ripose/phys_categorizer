Abstract

We demonstrate a possibility to stabilize three–dimensional spatiotemporal solitons
(“light bullets”) in self–focusing Kerr media by means of a combination of disper-
sion management in the longitudinal direction (with the group–velocity dispersion
alternating between positive and negative values) and periodic modulation of the
refractive index in one transverse direction, out of the two. The analysis is based
on the variational approximation (results of direct three-dimensional simulations
will be reported in a follow-up work). A predicted stability area is identiﬁed in the
model’s parameter space. It features a minimum of the necessary strength of the
transverse modulation of the refractive index, and ﬁnite minimum and maximum
values of the soliton’s energy. The former feature is also explained analytically.

1 Introduction

Search for spatiotemporal solitons in diverse optical media, alias “light bullets”
(LBs) [1], is a challenge to fundamental and applied research in nonlinear
optics, see original works [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] and a very recent review [11].
Stationary solutions for LBs can easily be found in the cubic (χ(3)) multi-
dimensional nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS) equation [1], but their stability is
a problem, as they are unstable against spatiotemporal collapse [12]. The
problem may be avoided by resorting to milder nonlinearities, such as saturable
[9], cubic-quintic [13], or quadratic (χ(2)) [2,3,4,5,6,7,8].

Despite considerable progress in theoretical studies, three-dimensional (3D)
LBs in a bulk medium have not yet been observed in an experiment. The
only successful experimental ﬁnding reported thus far was a stable quasi-2D
spatiotemporal soliton in χ(2) crystals [7] (the tilted-wavefront technique [14],
used in that work, precluded achieving self-conﬁnement in one transverse di-
rection). On the other hand, it was predicted [8] that a spatial cylindrical
soliton may be stabilized in a bulk medium composed of layers with alternat-
ing signs of the Kerr coeﬃcient. Similar stabilization was then predicted for
what may be regarded as 2D solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs),
with the coeﬃcient in front of the cubic nonlinear term subjected to periodic
modulation in time via the Feshbach resonance in external ac magnetic ﬁeld
[15,16]. However, no stable 3D soliton could be found in either realization
(optical or BEC) of this setting.

Serious diﬃculties encountered in the experimental search for LBs in 3D media
is an incentive to look for alternative settings admitting stable 3D optical soli-
tons. With the Kerr nonlinearity, a possibility is to use a layered structure that
periodically reverses the sign of the local group-velocity dispersion (GVD),
without aﬀecting the χ(3) coeﬃcient. This resembles a well-known scheme in
ﬁber optics, known as dispersion management (DM), see, e.g., Refs. [17] and
review [18]. A 2D generalization of the DM scheme was recently proposed,
assuming a layered planar waveguide of this type, uniform in the transverse
direction [19,20]. As a result, large stability regions for the 2D spatiotempo-
ral solitons were identiﬁed, including double-peaked breathers; however, a 3D
version of the same model could not give rise to any stable soliton [19]. It was
also shown in Ref. [19] that no stable 3D soliton could be found in a more
sophisticated model, which combines the DM and periodic modulation of the
Kerr coeﬃcient in the longitudinal direction.

Another approach to the stabilization of multidimensional solitons was devel-
oped in the context of the self-attracting BEC. It is based on the correspond-
ing Gross-Pitaevskii equation which includes a periodic potential created as
an optical lattice (OL, i.e., an interference pattern produced by illuminating
the condensate by counter-propagating coherent laser beams). It has been
demonstrated that 2D [21,22,23] and 3D [21] solitons can be easily stabilized
by the OL of the same dimension. Moreover, stable solitons can also be readily
supported by low-dimensional OLs, i.e., 1D and 2D ones in the 2D [23,24] and
3D [23,24,25] cases, respectively; additionally, a 3D soliton can be stabilized
by a cylindrical (Bessel ) lattice [26], similar to one introduced, in the context
of 2D models, in Ref. [27]. On the other hand, 3D solitons cannot be stabilized
by a 1D periodic potential [24]; however, the 1D lattice potential in combina-
tion with the above-mentioned time-periodic modulation of the nonlinearity,
provided by the Feshbach resonance in the ac magnetic ﬁeld, supports single-
and multi-peaked stable 3D solitons in vast areas of the respective parameter
space [28].

2

The above results suggest a possibility of existence of stable 3D “bullets” in
a χ(3) medium with the DM in the longitudinal direction (z), additionally
equipped with an eﬀective lattice potential (i.e., periodic modulation of the
refractive index) in one transverse direction (y), while in the remaining trans-
verse direction (x) the medium remains uniform. If this is possible, stable LBs
will be deﬁnitely possible too in a medium with the periodic modulation of
the refractive index in both transverse directions; however, the setting with
one uniform direction is more interesting in terms of steering solitons and
studying collisions between them [23,24]. The objective of the present work is
to predict such 3D spatiotemporal solitons and investigate their stability. Our
ﬁrst consideration of this possibility is based on the variational approximation
(VA); systematic simulations of the 3D model are quite complicated, and will
be presented in a follow-up work. It is relevant to mention that the existence
and stability of 3D solitons in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with the quasi-
2D periodic potential, which were originally predicted by the VA[23,24], was
deﬁnitely conﬁrmed by direct simulations [23,24,25], which suggests that in
the present model the 3D solitons may easily be stable too.

The model is based on the normalized NLS equation describing the evolution of
the local amplitude u of the electromagnetic wave, which is a straightforward
extension of the 2D model put forward in Ref. [19]:

Here, ε is the strength of the transverse modulation (the modulation period is
normalized to be π), while τ and D(z) are the same reduced temporal variable
and local GVD coeﬃcient as in the ﬁber-optic DM models [17,18].

Equation (1) implies the propagation of a linearly polarized wave, with the
single component u; a more general situation will be described by a two-
component (vectorial) version of Eq. (1), with the two polarization coupled,
as usual, by the cubic cross-phase-modulation terms. We do not expect that
the vectorial model will produce results qualitatively diﬀerent form those pre-
sented below. As usual, the NLS equation assumes the applicability of the
paraxial approximation, i.e., the spatial size of solitons (see below) must be
much larger than the underlying wavelength of light, which is deﬁnitely a
physically relevant assumption [11], and the temporal part of the equation
implies that the higher-order GVD is negligible (previous considerations have
demonstrated that the higher-order dispersion does not drastically alter DM
solitons [29]).

As is commonly adopted, we assume a symmetric DM map, with equal lengths
L of the normal- and anomalous-GVD segments (usually, the results are not

Recently, a somewhat similar 2D model was introduced in Ref. [30]. The most
(cid:12)
important diﬀerence is that it has the variable coeﬃcient D(z) multiplying
both the GVD and diﬀraction terms, uτ τ and uxx. Actually, that model was
motivated by a continuum limit of some discrete systems; in the present con-
text, it would be quite diﬃcult to implement the periodic reversal of the sign
of the transverse diﬀraction.

In the case of the piece-wise constant modulation, such as in (2), the variables
W , W ′, V , V ′, T and β must be continuous at junctions between the segments
with D±
Dm. As it follows from Eq. (8), the continuity of the temporal
chirp β(z) implies a jump of the derivative T ′ when passing from D− to D+,
or vice versa:

In the case of a continuous DM map, rather than the one (2), Eq. (11) has
a formal singularity at the points where D(z) vanishes, changing its sign.
However, it is known that there is no real singularity in this case, as T ′ vanishes
at the same points, which cancels the singularity out [18].

In the absence of the DM and transverse modulation, i.e., D

an interval D > 0, where the GVD is anomalous.

Another possible collapse scenario is an eﬀectively two-dimensional (weak)
one, with two widths shrinking to zero as z0 −

(in this case too, the collapse point z0 must belong to a segment with D > 0).
In direct simulations of Eqs. (9) - (11), we actually observed only the latter
scenario. However, we did not specially try to ﬁnd initial conditions that could
initiate a solution corresponding to the strong 3D collapse, as our objective
is not the study of the collapse, but rather search for solitons stable against
collapse. In fact, known results for the solitons in the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii
equation with the OL potential suggest that, while the VA may be incorrect
in the description of the collapse, as a singular solution, it provides for quite
accurate predictions for the stability of solitons as regular solutions [23,24].

However, we did not observed this collapse scenario in our simulations. The
same comment as one given above pertains to this case as well.

A possibility of the stabilization of the 3D soliton by a suﬃciently strong
lattice can be understood noticing that, for large ε, one may keep only the
ﬁrst two terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (10). This approximation yields
a nearly constant value V0 of V , which is a smaller root of the corresponding
equation,

the relevant one being limited by V0 < 2. Then, the substitution of V = V0
in the remaining equations (9) and (11) leads to essentially the same VA-
generated dynamical system as derived for the 2D DM model in Ref. [19],
which was shown to give rise to stable spatiotemporal solitons. On the other
hand, it was demonstrated in Ref. [19] too that, in the case of ε = 0, the 3D
VA equations, as well as the full underlying 3D model, have no stable soliton
solutions.

The stabilization of the LB in the present model for large ε can also be under-
stood in a diﬀerent way, without resorting to VA: in a very strong lattice, the
soliton is trapped entirely in a single “valley” of the periodic potential, and
the problem thus reduces to a nearly 2D one, where spatiotemporal solitons
may be stable, cf. a similar stabilization mechanism for the solitons in the
Gross-Pitaevskii equations developed in [16]. From this point of view, a really
interesting issue is to ﬁnd an actual minimum εmin of the lattice’s strength
which is necessary for the stabilization of the 3D solitons, as at ε close enough
to εmin the stabilized solitons are truly 3D objects, rather than their nearly-2D
counterparts.

3 Results

We explored the parameter space of the variational system (9) - (11),
,
by means of direct simulations of the equations (with regard to the jump con-
(cid:17)
dition (12)). As a result, it was possible to identify regions where the model
admits stable solitons featuring regular oscillations in z with the DM-map
period. An example of such a regime is shown in Fig. 1 (oscillations in the
evolution of W are not visible in the ﬁgure because, as an estimate demon-
strates, their amplitude is

E, ε, D
(cid:16)

0.001).

Systematic results obtained from the simulations are summarized in stability
diagrams displayed in Figs. 2 and 3. A remarkable fact, apparent in Fig. 2,
is that the minimum value of the lattice’s strength, εmin = 0.46, at which the
solitons may be stable, coincides with the analytical prediction (15), up to the
available numerical accuracy.

The existence of a maximum value Emax of the energy admitting the stable LBs
is, essentially, a quasi-2D feature, which can be understood assuming that the
potential lattice is strong. Indeed, as explained above, in such a case the value
of V is approximately ﬁxed as the smaller root of Eq. (14). Within a segment

(9) - (11). The soliton’s widths in the direction x, y and τ , i.e., W, V and T , are
shown as functions of z, for E = 0.5, ε = 1, and D = 0.

where the GVD coeﬃcient keeps the constant value, D+ = D + Dm > 0, which
corresponds to anomalous dispersion (see Eq. (2), the remaining equations (9)
and (11) are tantamount to those for a uniform 2D Kerr-self-focusing medium,
hence the energy is limited by the value Emax corresponding to the Townes
soliton; the soliton will collapse if E > Emax [12].

The fact that the region of stable solitons is also limited by a minimum energy,
Emin, except for the case of D = 0, when Emin = 0 (see Fig. 3)), is actually a
quasi-1D feature, which is characteristic to the DM solitons in optical ﬁbers.
E in the evolution equation for T (z), cf. Eq. (11),
In that case, the term
is necessary to balance the average GVD coeﬃcient D, so that Emin and D
vanish simultaneously [17]. It is noteworthy too that, as well as in the case
of the 1D DM solitons in ﬁbers, the stability area in Fig. 3 includes a part
with normal average GVD, D < 0, which seems counterintuitive, but can be
explained [17]. This part extends in Fig. 3 up to

0.005.

4 Conclusions

In this work, we have proposed a possibility to stabilize spatiotemporal solitons
(“light bullets”) in three-dimensional self-focusing Kerr media by means of the
dispersion management (DM), which means that the local group-velocity dis-
persion coeﬃcient alternates between positive and negative values along the
propagation direction, z. Recently, it was shown that the DM alone can stabi-
lize solitons in 2D (planar) waveguides, but in the bulk (3D) DM medium the
“bullets” are unstable. In this work, we have demonstrated that the complete
stabilization can be provided if the longitudinal DM is combined with peri-
odic modulation of the refractive index in one transverse direction (y), out of
the two. The analysis was based on the variational approximation (systematic
results of direct simulations will be reported in a follow-up paper). A stability
area for the light bullets was identiﬁed in the model’s parameter space. Its
salient features are a necessary minimum strength of the transverse modu-
lation of the refractive index, and minimum and maximum values Emin,max
of the soliton’s energy. The former feature can be accurately predicted (see
Eq. (15)) in an analytical form from the evolution equation for the width of
the soliton in the y-direction. The existence of Emin, which vanishes when we

assume zero average dispersion, can be explained in the same way as for the
temporal solitons in DM optical ﬁbers. Also, similar to the case of DM solitons
in ﬁbers, we ﬁnd that the stability area extends to a region of normal average
dispersion [17]. On the other hand, the existence of Emax can be understood
similarly to as it was recently done in the 2D counterpart of the present model
(the strong transverse lattice can squeeze the system to a nearly 2D shape).

The results presented in this work suggest a new approach to the challenging
problem of the creation of 3D spatiotemporal optical solitons. The model
also opens a way to address advanced issues, such as collisions between the
LBs, and the existence and stability of solitons with diﬀerent symmetries (for
instance, LBs which are odd in the longitudinal and/or transverse directions).
These issues will be considered elsewhere.

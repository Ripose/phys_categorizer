Abstract: Resonant nonlinear-optical interference processes in four-
level Doppler-broadened media are studied. Speciﬁc features of ampliﬁ-
cation and optical switching of short-wavelength radiation in a strongly-
absorbing resonant gas under coherent quantum control with two longer
wavelength radiations, are investigated. The major outcomes are illus-
trated with virtual experiments aimed at inversionless short-wavelength
ampliﬁcation, which also address deﬁciencies in this regard in recent ex-
periments. With numerical simulations related to the proposed exper-
iment in optically-dense sodium dimer vapor, we show optimal condi-
tion for optical switching and the expected gain of the probe radiation,
which is above the oscillation threshold.

1 Introduction

Coherent quantum control (CQC) of optical processes have proven to be a powerful
tool to manipulate refraction, absorption, transparency, gain and conversion of electro-
magnetic radiation (for a review, see [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]). Among recent achieve-
ments are the slowing down of the light group speed to a few m/s, highly-eﬃcient
frequency conversion, squeezed quantum state light sources and optical switches for
quantum information processing [9, 10, 11, 12]. Much interest has been shown in the
physics and diverse practical schemes of ampliﬁcation without inversion (AWI). This
present paper is aimed at studying nonlinear coherence and interference eﬀects (NIE)
underlying an approach which accounts for the speciﬁc features of Doppler broadening
of coherently-driven quantum transitions and the inhomogeneous distribution of the
power saturated material parameters along the medium. Special emphasis is placed on
NIE processes, which would allow converting easily-achievable long-wavelength gain to
a higher- frequency interval. Another outcome is the realization of the optical switching
of the medium from opaque to amplifying via a transparent state by small variation of
the intensity or frequency of one of the coupled radiations. Important features of both
the signal and idle radiation produced with the aid of the proposed scheme entail the
suppression of quantum noise. We propose potential experiments towards inversionless
generation and optical switch based on CQC. The potential and optimum conditions
for the realization of such eﬀects in an optically-dense Doppler-broadened medium are
explored.

2 Resonance coherence and interference processes at Doppler broadened

transitions: propagation features and parametric gain

A typical coupling schematic relevant to the topics under discussion and to the exper-
imental situation [13] is depicted in Fig. 1. A weak probe radiation E4 at frequency
ω4 propagates through an optically-dense Doppler-broadened medium controlled with
two longer-wavelength driving radiations E1 and E3 at ω1 and ω3. All waves are co-
propagating. Owing to four-wave mixing (FWM), the probe wave generates radiation
at ω2 = ω1 + ω3 − ω4 at the transition gn, where the driving ﬁeld E1 easily produces a
large Stokes gain. Alternatively, the enhanced generated radiation E2 contributes back
to E4 due to FWM, which dramatically changes the propagation features of the probe
ﬁeld. Therefore, the problem under consideration reduces to the solution of a set of the
coupled equations for the four waves (Ei/2) exp[i(kiz − ωit)] + c.c. (i = 1...4), traveling
in a optically-thick medium:

dE4,2(z)/dz = iσ4,2E4,2 + i˜σ4,2E1E3E ∗
dE1,3(z)/dz = iσ1,3E1,3 + i˜σ1,3E4E2E ∗

2,4,
3,1.

(1)
(2)

Here ω4 + ω2 = ω1 + ω3, kj are wave numbers in a vacuum, σj = −2πkjχj = δkj + iαj/2,
αj and δkj are intensity-dependent absorption indices and dispersion parts of the wave
numbers, ˜σ4 = −2πk4 ˜χ4 (etc.) is a FWM cross-coupling parameter, and χj and ˜χj
are the corresponding nonlinear susceptibilities dressed by the driving ﬁelds. An am-
pliﬁcation or absorption of any of the coupled radiations inﬂuences the propagation
features of the other ones. In the the approximation that a change of the driving ra-
diations E1,3 along the medium is neglected (for example, at the expense of the satu-
ration eﬀects), the system (1)-(2) reduces to two coupled standard equations of non-
linear optics for E4 and E2, whereas the medium parameters are homogeneous along
z. If ∆k = δk1 + δk3 − δk2 − δk4 = 0, the input values I4,2 ≡ |E4,2|2 at z = 0 are
I20 = 0, I40 6= 0 and the absorption (gain) rate substantially exceeds that of the nonlin-
ear optical conversion we obtain at the exit of the medium of the length L:

I4/I40 = | exp(−α4l/2) + (γ 2/(2β)2) [exp(g2L/2) − exp(−α4L/2)] |2.

Alternatively, if I40 = 0, I20 6= 0,

η4 = I4/I20 = (|γ4|2/(2β)2) |exp(g2L/2) − exp(− α4L/2)|2 .

(3)

(4)

Here γ 2 = γ ∗
2 γ4, γ4,2 = χ4,2E1E3, β = (α4 − α2)/4, (|γ 2|/β2 ≪ 1), and g2 ≡ −α2.
From (3) and (4) it follows that at relatively small lengths the FWM coupling may even
increase the depletion rate of the probe radiation, depending on the signs of Imγ4,2 and
Reγ4,2. In order to achieve ampliﬁcation, large optical lengths L and signiﬁcant Stokes
gain on the transition gn (exp(g2L/2) ≫ |(2β)2/γ 2|), as well as eﬀective FWM both at
ω2 and ω4, are required.

The important feature of the considered far-from-degenerate interaction is that the
magnitude and sign of single-photon and multiphoton resonance detunings and, conse-
quently, of the amplitudes and phases of nonlinear polarizations, diﬀer for molecules at
diﬀerent velocities due to the diﬀerence in their frequency Doppler shifts. Their interfer-
ence determined by the interference of elementary quantum pathways, and accounting
for Maxwell’s velocity distribution and saturation eﬀects, results in a nontrivial depen-
dence of the material macroscopic parameters on the intensities of the driving ﬁelds and
on the frequency detunings from the Doppler-broadened resonances. The relevant solu-
tions for elements of the density matrix, and consequently for the material parameters
in the ED equations (1) and (2), are cumbersome. They are provided in [14, 15], where
the solution is found exactly with respect to E1,3 and in the ﬁrst approximation for E4,2.
The various relaxation processes, Boltzmann excitation of the level n, distribution over
rotational sub-levels and dependence on the molecule velocity were taken into account.
This allows numerical averaging over the Maxwell velocity distribution as well as further
virtual experiments. These formulas are used here for analysis of the dependence of the
quantities α4,2 and γ4,2 on the intensities and frequencies of the ﬁelds and also to obtain
a numerical solution of the system (1)–(2) which accounts for the inhomogeneity of the
coeﬃcients and phase mismatch ∆k.

The numerical simulations are done for the transitions l−g −n−m−l (Fig. 1) attributed
to those of sodium dimers [N a2: X ′Σ+
u (6, 45)(λ1 = 655
nm)−X 1Σ+
g (0, 45)(λ4 = 480
nm)] from the experiment [13] and using experimental relaxation data. The Doppler
width of the transition (FWHM) at the wavelength λ4 = 480 nm at a temperature of
about 450◦ C is approximately equal to 1.7 GHz. Then the Boltzmann population of
level n is about 2% of that of level l. The driving radiations are set at exact resonance
with the corresponding transitions (Ω1 = ω1 − ωgl = 0, Ω3 = ω3 − ωmn = 0) and are
characterized by the coupling Rabi frequencies G1 = E1dlg/2¯h and G3 = E3dnm/2¯h.
The resonant condition results in strong depletion of the driving radiation E1 along the
medium. We scale the length of the medium L to the absorption length L4 = 1/α40 at
Ω4 = ω4 − ωml = 0, with all driving ﬁelds turned oﬀ.

Figures 2(a-c) and the movie mov1a.mov and mov1b.mov display changes in the
spectral dependencies of the velocity averaged material parameters with variation of the
driving ﬁelds. Figure 2(a) is generated for the input Rabi frequencies G10 = 60 MHz and
G30 = 20 MHz. It displays substantial Autler-Townes splitting of the Stokes lineshape
with minimum gain in the resonance. Corresponding quantum interference structures
appear in the absorption and FWM coupling parameters, which behave quite diﬀerently.
As it is shown below, maximum gain I4(L)/I40 occurs at L/L40 = 15, where the driving
ﬁelds deplete down to G1 = 16 MHz and G3 = 19 MHz. This gives rise to a dramatic
change in the spectral properties of absorption (upper plot), of the Stokes gain (lower
plot) and of the FWM coupling parameters γ4,2 (Fig. 2b). Due to the interplay of the
quantum interference processes and population cycling in the strong ﬁelds, absorption
at the resonance becomes even larger than in the unperturbed medium. Figure 2(c),
computed for G1 = 60 MHz and G3 = 80, displays further feasibility to manipulate
material parameters with quantum coherence and interference processes. Figure 3 (a-c)
and the movies mov2a.mov and mov2b.mov display AWI in an optically-thick Doppler-
broadened medium controlled with injected coherence. Figure 3(a) corresponds to the
input intensities, selected for the Fig. 2(a). It shows a substantial gain, provided by
the right choice of the optimum optical length and resonance detunings. The virtual
experiment displays no gain in the resonance. Due to the interplay of the absorption,

Stokes gain and FWM processes as well as depletion of the driving radiation along the

increase in the intensity of the driving ﬁeld E3 even decreases the output signal radiation.

of the frequency or the medium length (see, e.g., Fig. 3(a)) or the driving intensities
(see the movies mov2a.mov and mov2b.mov) in properly-chosen intervals give rise to
dramatic change in the intensity of the transmitted signal. This allows one to realize

optical switching, based on quantum coherence processes. As examples, the upper inset
in Fig. 4 is derived from the movies mov2a.mov and mov2b.mov for G30 = 20 MHz,

near the entrance of the cell, parametric coupling even increases the rate of depletion of
the probe radiation. Figure 5 presents numerical analysis of the experiment [13]. In the

experiment all four ﬁelds were set in corresponding resonances, the input Rabi frequency
at the Stokes transition being about 10 times larger than the probe one. This was in turn
assumed for computing Figs.5(a) and 5(b). The upper inset in Fig. 5(a) depicts depletion
of the driving radiation E1 (G10 = 12 MHz, G30 = 7 MHz), at the the optical length,
corresponding to the experimental value. The computed gain of the Stokes beam (main
plot in Fig. 5(a)) as well as that for the probe radiation (main plot in Fig. 5(b)) are in a
good agreement with the experimental data. This simulation is aimed at demonstrating
that the gain of the probe radiation is derived from FWM with no contribution of the
parametric ampliﬁcation. Parametric ampliﬁcation in the conditions of this experiment
could be achieved by turning oﬀ the input Stokes radiation. Indeed, in this case only
depletion of the probe radiation (lower inset inset in Fig. 5(b)) and weak output Stokes
intensity (lower inset in Fig. 5(a)) come out from the same numerical simulations.

The main plots in the Figs, 5(c,d) are to propose favorable conditions for inver-
sionless ampliﬁcation. These plots are generated for the input driving Rabi frequencies
G10 = 60 MHz, G30 = 30 MHz and for the near optimum detuning Ω4 = 35 MHz.
The main plot in Fig. 5(c) displays substantial inversionless ampliﬁcation, and in Fig.
5(d), generated idle radiation under relatively low input intensities. For the selected
transitions a characteristic value of the Rabi frequency of about 80 MHz approximately
corresponds to radiation powers in the interval 100 to 200 mW focused on a spot with
sizes of about a few parts of a millimeter. In the same conditions, but for the probe ﬁeld
tuned to the resonance (at Ω4 = 0), gain does not exist and generated idle radiation
dramatically decreases (upper insets in Figs. 5(c,d)). All the above presented simula-
tions account for phase mismatch stipulated from the detunings. Both probe and idle
radiations are supposed to be weak and unperturbative.

NIE as an origin of the diﬀerence in the rates of induced transitions from upper
and lower levels and consequently – of AWI were discussed in ref. [16]. The optimum
conditions and features of AWI were explored and numerically illustrated for three level
V scheme of neon transitions in ref. [17, 18, 19]. Related experiments and evidence of
AWI were reported in ref. [20] (for review of the later works see ref. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8]). In order to simplify the proposed experiment we do not assume here a source of
incoherent excitation of the medium (the formulas accounting for such excitation are
provided in ref. [14, 15]). Therefore the energy acquired by the probe ﬁeld here is taken

entirely from the driving ﬁelds. However we call the eﬀect as inversionless gain, derived
from the quantum coherence and interference processes, rather than optical parametric
ampliﬁcation. This is due to the fact that the discussed ampliﬁcation eﬀect can not be
thought as the result of the consequent separate elementary eﬀects of absorption, FWM,
Stokes gain and back FWM giving rise to OPA. We want to stress that consideration
of these processes separately in a resonant medium is not adequate for the physics
of the interference process and, as it has been shown in [21], would result even in
qualitatively wrong predictions. The proposed approach based on NIE increases number
of the interfering channels for the energy conversion including those through populating
of the excited levels, modiﬁed Raman-type and parametric processes.

4 Conclusion

In conclusion, this paper considers various optical processes in four-level Doppler-broa-
dened media, controlled with laser injected coherence. The scheme of inversionless am-
pliﬁcation and optical switching of short-wavelength radiation in strongly-absorbing
resonant four-level gas is proposed. They are controlled with two driving ﬁelds at longer
wavelengths and become possible due to the optical parametric coupling and readily-
achievable Stokes gain. Optimal conditions for the experiment on sodium dimer vapor
and the expected gain are explored with the aid of numerical simulations. The relevant
driving intensities correspond to focused cw radiation on the order of several tens of
mW, i.e., to about one photon per thousand molecules. The analysis shows that further
increase of the driving Rabi frequencies up to about 100-200 MHz allows one to achieve
the gain above the threshold of mirror-less self-oscillation.

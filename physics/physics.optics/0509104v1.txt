We demonstrate that ﬁrst-order light-shifts can be cancelled for an all-optical, three-photon-
absorption resonance (“N -resonance”) on the D1 transition of 87Rb. This light-shift cancellation
enables improved frequency stability for an N -resonance clock. For example, using a table-top
apparatus designed for N -resonance spectroscopy, we measured a short-term fractional frequency
−11 τ −1/2 for observation times 1 s . τ . 50 s. Further
stability (Allan deviation) ≃ 1.5 × 10
improvements in frequency stability should be possible with an apparatus designed as a dedicated
N -resonance clock.

There is great current interest in developing small, eco-
nomical atomic frequency standards (clocks) with frac-
tional frequency stability ∼ 10−12 or better. Signiﬁcant
progress toward this goal has been achieved using coher-
ent population trapping (CPT) resonances in atomic va-
por [1]. However, the frequency stability of CPT clocks is
limited in part by light-shifts, i.e., shifts of the resonance
frequency due to the applied electromagnetic ﬁelds [2, 3].
Recently our group demonstrated that a three-photon-
absorption resonance (known as an “N -resonance”) is a
promising alternative for small atomic clocks [4]. Here
we show that it is possible to cancel ﬁrst-order light-
shifts by optimizing the intensity ratio and frequency
of the two optical ﬁelds that create and interrogate the
N -resonance. Employing such light-shift cancellation in
a simple, table-top apparatus, we observed promising
short-term frequency stability (≈ 1.5 × 10−11 τ −1/2) for
an N -resonance on the D1 transition of 87Rb vapor. We
expect superior frequency stability will be possible in a
small N -resonance clock designed for good thermal con-
trol, low phase noise, etc.

Fig. 1(a) shows the N -resonance interaction scheme [4,
5]. A probe ﬁeld ΩP and drive ﬁeld ΩD are in two-photon
Raman resonance with the ground-state hyperﬁne levels
|bi and |ci, with ΩP nearly resonant with the optical
transition |ci → |ai and ΩD red-detuned from this opti-
cal transition by the ground-state hyperﬁne splitting ν0
(≃ 6.835 GHz for 87Rb). The two-photon Raman process
drives atoms coherently from state |bi to |ci, followed by
a one-photon transition to excited state |ai via absorp-
tion from ﬁeld ΩP . Together, this three-photon process
produces a narrow absorptive resonance in the probe ﬁeld
transmitted intensity, with a width that is limited by the
relaxation rate of the atoms’ ground-state coherence.

For such an idealized three-level N -resonance, the
light-shift δ (i.e., the detuning from ν0 of the diﬀerence
frequency between the probe and drive ﬁelds, as mea-
sured by maximum probe ﬁeld absorption) consists of
three leading (ﬁrst-order) terms: shifts of both ground-
states due to interaction with the strong, far-detuned

the probe and drive ﬁelds’ Rabi frequencies. The light-
shifts due to the far-detuned drive ﬁeld (the ﬁrst and
second terms in Eq.(1)) are proportional to the drive
ﬁeld intensity, but practically independent of the laser
frequency for ∆ ≪ ν0.
In contrast, the light-shift due
to the near-resonant probe ﬁeld (the last term in Eq.(1))
has a strong dispersive-like dependence on ∆. Thus, near
the extrema, ∆ = ±γ/2, the total N -resonance light-shift
has only a quadratic dependence on the probe ﬁeld de-
tuning:

This light-shift can then be cancelled by (i) detuning
the probe ﬁeld to the high-frequency extremum, and (ii)
properly setting the intensity ratio of the drive and probe
ﬁelds:

∆ = γ/2,

With such light-shift cancellation, the measured N -
resonance center frequency should be insensitive (to lead-
ing order) to ﬂuctuations of the probe ﬁeld frequency and
total laser intensity. Note that the light-shift cancellation
does not depend on the absolute values of either optical
ﬁeld.

To verify these predictions, we measured 87Rb N -
resonance light-shifts using the experimental setup shown
in Fig. 1(b). We phase-modulated the output of a free-
running New Focus external cavity diode laser using
an electro-optical modulator (EOM), which produced
two optical sidebands separated by ≃ 6.835 GHz. The
EOM was driven by a microwave synthesizer locked to a
100 MHz voltage-controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO).
The laser frequency was adjusted such that the high-
frequency sideband (serving as the probe ﬁeld ΩP ) was
tuned close to the 5S1/2 F = 2 → 5P1/2 F ′ = 2 tran-
sition of 87Rb (λ ≃ 795 nm); the carrier-frequency ﬁeld
then served as the drive ﬁeld ΩD. The probe/drive ﬁeld
intensity ratio was set by the EOM phase-modulation
index. The laser beam was circularly polarized using a
quarter wave plate and weakly focused to a diameter of
0.8 mm before entering the Rb vapor cell.

We employed a cylindrical Pyrex cell containing iso-
topically enriched 87Rb and a mixture of buﬀer gases
(15 Torr Ne + 15 Torr Ar + 5 Torr N2) chosen to min-
imize the temperature dependence of the 87Rb ground-
state hyperﬁne frequency shift due to buﬀer gas colli-
sions [6]. Associated collisional broadening of the ex-
cited state is estimated to be γ ≈ π × 1.2 GHz. During
experiments, the vapor cell was heated to 55 ◦C and iso-
lated from external magnetic ﬁelds with three layers of
high permeability shielding. A small (≈ 10 mG) longi-
tudinal magnetic ﬁeld was applied to lift the degeneracy
of the Zeeman sublevels and separate the desired F = 1,
mF = 0 to F = 2, mF = 0 clock transition (no ﬁrst-order

sitions (ﬁrst-order Zeeman splitting). The strong drive
ﬁeld and the lower-frequency sideband were ﬁltered from
the light transmitted through the cell using a quartz,
narrow-band Fabry-Perot etalon (free spectral range of
20 GHz, ﬁnesse of 30), which was tuned to the frequency
of the probe ﬁeld and placed before the photodetector
(PD).

To lock the frequency of the VCXO (and hence the de-
tuning of the probe and drive ﬁelds) to the N -resonance,
we superimposed a slow frequency modulation at fm =
400 Hz on the 6.8 GHz signal from the microwave syn-
thesizer. We demodulated the photodetector output at
fm with a lock-in ampliﬁer, and used the in-phase lock-
in ampliﬁer output as an error signal to feed back to the
VCXO. We then monitored the frequency of the locked
VCXO (and thus the N -resonance center frequency) by
comparing it with a 100 MHz signal derived from a hy-
drogen maser.

dence of the N -resonance frequency on laser detuning, in-

which implies a shot-noise-limited short-term frequency
≃ 5 × 10−14 τ −1/2 [3]. Fig. 4 shows the measured N -
resonance clock fractional frequency stability (Allan de-
viation). The short-term stability ≃ 1.5×10−11 τ −1/2 for
observation times 1 s . τ . 50 s. At longer times the sta-
bility degrades due to uncontrolled temperature and me-
chanical variations in our table-top apparatus, as well as
long-term drifts of the laser frequency. Despite this non-
optimal clock apparatus, the short-term N -resonance fre-
quency stability is already better than that provided by
many recently-demonstrated CPT clocks [1, 7, 8]. We
expect that both the short- and long-term N -resonance
frequency stability can be further improved by straight-
forward optimization of the VCXO lock-loop (to reduce
phase noise), temperature stabilization, laser control, etc.
We also expect that a high-stability N -resonance clock
should be possible in a compact physical package (with
vapor cell volume ∼ 1 mm3), because of promising N -
resonance characteristics at high buﬀer gas pressure [4].
In conclusion, we demonstrated cancellation of
ﬁrst-order light-shifts for an all-optical, three-photon-
absorption N -resonance on the D1 line of 87Rb vapor.
Employing this light-shift cancellation in a table-top
apparatus not engineered for stable clock performance,
we nonetheless observed N -resonance frequency stability
comparable to or better than existing CPT clocks. Sign-
ﬁcant improvements in N -resonance frequency stability
should be possible in a small device with standard tech-
niques. We note also that similar light-shift cancellation
is possible for other N -resonances, e.g., the Rb D2 line
(λ = 780 nm). Currently, diode lasers for the D2 line of
Rb and Cs are more easily obtained than for the D1 line.

with Eq.(1), we observed two extrema in the detuning
light-shift: one below and one above the probe ﬁeld reso-
nance frequency; see Fig. 2(a). As illustrated in Fig. 2(b),
we found that the probe ﬁeld detuning at the light-shift
maximum (∆ ≈ 700 MHz) is eﬀectively independent of
the total laser intensity, as expected from Eq.(2), when
the probe/drive ﬁeld intensity ratio |ΩP |2/|ΩD|2 is set
to make the total light-shift independent of the laser in-
tensity. We determined this intensity light-shift cancel-
lation ratio (|ΩP |2/|ΩD|2 ≃ 11%, given by EOM phase-
modulation index ≃ 0.22) from the measurements shown
in Fig. 3. Note that the experimentally-determined ra-
tio is in reasonable agreement with the prediction of
|ΩP |2/|ΩD|2 ≃ 9% given by Eq.(3) for our experimen-
tal conditions.

We next characterized the frequency stability of a
crude “N -resonance clock” — i.e., the VCXO locked to
the 87Rb N -resonance as described above — relative to
a hydrogen maser. For this measurement we tuned our
system to the conditions for optimal light-shift cancella-
tion (laser detuning ∆ ≃ 700 MHz, probe/drive intensity
ratio ≃ 11%) with total laser power ≃ 140 µW (intensity

Abstract

To identify the optimum conditions for the optical trapping of a droplet under
microgravity, we theoretically analyzed the eﬃciency of trapping with counter laser
beams. We found that the distance between the two foci is an important parameter
for obtaining stable trapping conditions. We also performed an optical trapping
experiment with counter laser beams under microgravity. The experimental results
correspond well to the theoretical prediction.

1 Introduction

Since the discovery of optical trapping in 1970 by Ashkin[1], optical tweezers
have been actively applied in the ﬁelds of biology, physical chemistry, con-
densed matter physics and so on[2]. Recently, some reports have mentioned
the advantages of such systems on the International Space Station (ISS)[3][4].
The technique of optical trapping is expected to be useful on the ISS for the
manipulation of droplets on a µm to sub-mm scale, including in crystal growth
by avoiding the eﬀect of vessels. However, as far as we know, there has been
no report on the optical trapping of a droplet under microgravity conditions
in air.

Recently, we reported the optical levitation of a droplet under a linear in-
crease in gravitational acceleration using a single laser[5]. To attain stable
optical trapping with a single beam, it is necessary to use a lens with a high
magniﬁcation. This means that the working distance, or the distance between
the lens surface and the object, is rather small; on the order of a few mm. In
view of such application on the ISS, it is important to ﬁnd the stable trapping
condition with a greater working distance. Toward this end, we adapted an
optical system with low-converged counter laser beams for optical trapping
with a long working distance.

2 Theoretical

We consider the counter laser system shown in Fig.1. In this system, the dis-
tance between the foci d plays a crucial role. Although the qualitative property
of such counter laser systems has been discussed in Ref.[6], the eﬀect of the
distance d has not yet been discussed in detail. Here, we calculate the trap-
ping force produced by counter lasers with the variables d and R (which is the
radius of a spherical object).

To take into account the eﬀect of the inertia of the object, we start our dis-
cussion with a motion equation. To simplify the problem, we consider motion
along the x-direction as in Fig.1.

m¨x = Fl + Fv + Fothers

(1)

where m is the mass of the object, ¨x is the acceleration of the object along
the x-direction, Fl is the force along the optical axis induced by the converged
laser, and Fothers is the other forces (including the eﬀective acceleration force
along the x-direction and random force induced by air).

As we see in the latter part, the velocity of the trapped object U is at most

2

10−3mm. We assume that the scale of the trapped object L is at most 10−4m,
and the kinetic viscosity of air ν is around 10−5m2/s. In this condition, the
Reynolds number is: Re = RU/ν ≃ 10−2 ≪ 1 and we can apply Stokes’
approximation. By calculating m = 4πa3ρ/3 and Fv = 6πηRv, we can verify
the relation mv2/2 ≪ Fv · ∆x; where the radius of the trapped droplet R is on
the order of 10 µm, the experimental time resolution ∆t is 0.33 s, the velocity
of the trapped droplet v = ∆x/∆t, the viscosity of air η = 1.8 × 10−5 Pa · s
and the density of the droplet ρ = 1.0 × 103kg/m3. This estimation indicates
that the viscous force is large enough to locate the droplet at an equilibrium
position in the optical potential. Therefore, under reasonable assumptions of
the viscous limit, we discuss the stability of trapping droplets through Fl and
the eﬀective optical potential.

Fl is found as follows. In the case of trapping a large object(R/λ > 10, where
λ is the wavelength of laser), we can calculate the trapping force with the ray
optics theory. Within the framework of ray optics, a TEM00 mode laser can
be divided into rays, which are suﬃxed with i, and each power of the ray Pi
is related to the beam deviation σ and lens size L Each ray hits the surface
of the droplet at a diﬀerent incident angle φi (0 ≤ φi ≤ φ), repeatedly reﬂects
and is transmitted in the droplet until the intensity of the rays decreases to
the zero limit, and the momentum is given with a certain eﬃciency along the
x-axis, Qi = Qi(R, x; φi, n1, n2):

where θi: incident angle, ri: refractive angle, Ri:reﬂection coeﬃcient and Ti:

geometric relation between the droplet and the direction of the beam (see
ref.[7]). Assuming a spherical droplet with radius R whose center is located at
distance x from the center of the foci, we calculate the details of the reﬂections
and transmissions for all paths of the laser beam. The total force fl is

Fig. 2. Calculated potential of the counter beam lasers, deduced by a theoretical cal-
culation. (a) d < 0. (b) d > 0. In the theoretical calculation, the following parameters
were used: laser power P = 150 mW, convergence angle φ = 17.0 degrees, injected
ratio of laser to the lens σ/L = 1.5, refractive index of the medium n1 = 1.00, re-
fractive index of the droplet n2 = 1.35, density of the droplet ρ = 9.65 × 102 kg/m3.
(c)Schematic illustration of the calculated potential ((a) and (b)) made by the
two-beam lasers, considering the radius of the droplet and the disagreement be-
tween the axes.

Under the assumption of a spherical trapped object, optical trapping exhibits
geometrical symmetry and we can use a normalized unit of length. Eventually,
the optical potential is expressed by two normalized parameters, d/R and x/R.

The results of the calculation for eﬀective trapping potential are shown in
Fig.2, indicating that the trapping eﬃciency is signiﬁcantly dependent on d.
An optical conﬁguration with positive d is clearly preferable for optilcal trap-
ping under microgravity. Figure 2(c) shows the change in the potential proﬁle
as a function of d/R. As shown, not only the distance between the foci but
also the radius of the droplet greatly aﬀect the proﬁle of the optical potential.
This chart is reasonable for understanding qualitative properties: if the radius
R is suﬃciently large, the trapped object is insensitive to the distance between
the foci d and the sign of d become less important. In contrast, when R is suf-
ﬁciently small, d becomes non-negligible and we must choose better settings
of d. Since we sought to deﬁne the optimum conditions for trapping large ob-
jects (sub-mm scale), this diagram is applicable for designing a counter laser

trapping system. For example. if we can precisely adjust the positions of the
foci, the setting at d/R = 4 is advantageous for trapping the object rather
than d/R = −4. The potentiality to trap small particles is important in the
growth of protein crystals[8][9] and liquid droplets[10].

3 Experimental

Microgravity conditions were achieved by using a jet airplane(Mitsubishi MU-
300, operated by Diamond Air Service Co., Aichi, Japan). In the experiment,
the airplane ﬂew along a parabolic ﬂight proﬁle, as shown in Fig.3. During
parabolic ﬂight, the eﬀective gravitational acceleration g in the airplane was
0.01 g0 for about 20 s, where the gravitational acceleration on the ground
g0 = 9.8m/s2.

The experimental setup for the optical trapping is shown in Fig.3(b). We
selected a counter laser system to press the droplets to the center of the
foci.[11][12] The laser beam from a diode pumped Nd : YVO4(λ = 532 nm)
was split into two beams by a half mirror, transferred via optical ﬁbers, and
focused by achromatic lenses. The convergence angle of the lenses was 17
degrees, so the working distance was on the order of cm. The laser power was
set to 170 mW. We arranged two diﬀerent optical settings, where the positions
of the laser foci are diﬀerent, either d is positive or negative as shown in Fig.1.
The droplets were injected into a glass cell (10mm × 10mm × 50mm) with
an atomizer. The droplets, as visualized by scattering visible laser light, were
monitored with a CCD camera from the y-direction in Fig.3(b). Movies were
recorded at 30 frames per second. The experiments was carried out at arround

4 Results and Discussion

On the ground in air, using the same optical trapping system, the injected
droplets immediately fell due to the force of gravity. However, under micro-
gravity in air, most of the droplets didn’t fall and we could observe the mo-
tions of the droplets along the laser axes. To trace the droplets’ motion along
the laser axes, we converted the movie images to a spatio-temporal diagram.
Figure 4 shows the results of the optical trapping of the droplets under mi-
crogravity.

Figure 4 (a1) and (b1) are spatio-temporal diagrams which show the trajectory
of the droplets. Figure 4 (a2) and (b2) are snapshots of the droplets. In these
ﬁgures, the burring on the images correspond to rather fast motion of the
droplets. The small white spots are droplets that have departed from the laser
axes and are ﬂoating in front of or behind the camera foci. In contrast, a
trapped droplet is a star-like object(white arrow), since a trapped droplet on
the laser axes scatter light intensively.

Figure 4(c) shows typical proﬁles depicted based on the results of Fig.2(a) and
(b), which are associated with the two diﬀerent optical settings in Fig.4(a2)
and (b2). As shown near the trapping region, the gradient force in the case of
the solid arrow is much greater than that in the case of the dashed arrow(d/R =
−4). It is clear that our theoretical study reproduces the experimental trends
well.

5 Conclusion

We performed the optical trapping of a water droplet with a counter laser in air
under microgravity and investigated the properties of the counter laser trap-
ping system. We showed that the position of the laser foci strongly aﬀected the
trapping eﬃciency. A theoretical calculation based on ray optics reproduced
the experimental trend. The present results may contribute to the design of
a manipulation system on the International Space Station (ISS), including
experiments on protein crystal growth and a container-less micro-reactor.

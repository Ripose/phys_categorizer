beam

We have developed a scheme to measure the optical torque, exerted by a laser beam on a phase
object, by measuring the orbital angular momentum of the transmitted beam. The experiment is
a macroscopic simulation of a situation in optical tweezers, as orbital angular momentum has been
widely used to apply torque to microscopic objects. A hologram designed to generate LG02 modes
and a CCD camera are used to detect the orbital component of the beam. Experimental results
agree with theoretical numerical calculations, and the strength of the orbital component suggest its
usefulness in optical tweezers for micromanipulation.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Optical tweezers trap microscopic particles using the
gradient force generated by a tightly focused laser beam
[1]. Angular momentum (AM) in the beam can be trans-
ferred to the trapped particle via absorption or scatter-
ing. Both spin and orbital angular momentum have been
used to rotate absorbing particles [2, 3, 4, 5]. Spin angu-
lar momentum is due to the polarisation of light, and is
±¯h per photon for left or right circularly polarised light
[6, 7]. Angular momentum due to the spatial distribu-
tion of the light’s wavefront is called orbital angular mo-
memtum, and is l ¯h per photon, where l is the azimuthal
mode index [8]. Polarised light can be used to rotate
transparent birefringent particles [9, 10] and transparent
nonspherical particles [11, 12, 13]. In both of these cases,
the torque is due to the transfer of spin angular momen-
tum, and can be determined by measuring the degree of
circular polarisation of the light once it has been trans-
mitted through the particle in the trap [11].

Elongated particles have also been aligned through
the exchange of orbital angular momentum using non-
circular beams [14, 15, 16].
In this case, the gradient
forces that act in optical tweezers to attract a transparent
particle towards regions of high intensity act to rotate the
particle so that it lies within the non-circular high inten-
sity focal spot. The same eﬀect can be achieved by using
two independent beams to trap the ends of an elongated
particle [17]. Since this torque arises purely from the in-
teraction between the particle and the intensity proﬁle of
the beam, and is therefore independent of the polarisa-
tion, it depends solely on the transfer of orbital angular
momentum. Notably, when rotating elongated objects,
this torque is much greater than that due to polarisa-
tion [11], so the use of orbital angular momentum can
be highly desirable. However, to optically measure the
total angular momentum transferred to the particle, the
orbital component must also be measured. The measure-
ment of this orbital component is the goal of this present
work. However, to avoid the complication of a highly
converging and diverging beam and microscope optics, a
macroscopic experiment is performed rather than using

optical tweezers. This is also desirable to avoid eﬀects
due to spin angular momentum. We simulate the align-
ment of an elongated object (a rod) to an elliptical beam
on a macroscopic scale. The torque on the rod can then
be determined by measuring the resulting angular mo-
mentum in the beam.

Laguerre–Gauss (LG) modes of laser light with a phase
singularity in the centre of the beam carry orbital AM [8].
These modes of laser light can be made using computer
generated holograms [18]. A hologram is a recording of
the interference pattern by a light ﬁeld of interest with a
reference beam. By calculating the interference pattern
that results from a plane wave and LG mode we can
make a hologram which will generate LG modes when
illuminated by a Gaussian beam. The same hologram
pattern that was used to make a beam with orbital AM
can also be used to detect orbital AM in a beam as we
will demonstrate in this paper.

Orbital angular momentum states are also of interest
to the quantum information and communication ﬁelds
as the inﬁnite spatial modes oﬀer multidimensional en-
tanglement. Computer generated holograms have been
used to generate superpositions of LG modes, and the
same holograms can be used to detect these states. These
schemes have been proposed to measure entanglement on
the single photon level [19, 20].

II. THEORY

That light and other electromagnetic ﬁelds can carry
angular momentum follows directly from the transport of
linear momentum, since the linear and angular momen-
tum ﬂux densities J and p are related by

J = r × p.

For electromagnetic ﬁelds, the momentum ﬂux density is
given by

p = S/c = E × H/c

where S is the Poynting vector and c is the speed of
light. The coupled electric and magnetic ﬁelds form

(1)

(2)

a spin-1 system, and,
in general, (1) includes both a
spin component, associated with the polarization, and
an orbital component due to the spatial structure of the
ﬁeld [21, 22].

A monochromatic paraxial ﬁeld, such as a typical laser
beam, can be speciﬁed by a slowly varying complex scalar
amplitude function u that satisﬁes the scalar paraxial
wave equation [23]:

∂2
∂x2 +

∂2
∂y2 − 2ik

∂
∂z (cid:19)

(cid:18)

u = 0.

(3)

In the paraxial approximation, the two tranverse vec-
tor components of the ﬁeld de-couple, and the longitu-
dinal component vanishes. Thus, the two linearly po-
larized components of the amplitude individually satisfy
the scalar paraxial wave equation, and the spin and or-
bital angular momenta de-couple. Henceforth, we will
only consider the orbital angular momentum about the
beam axis, which can be found using the orbital angular
momentum operator in cylindrical coordinates:

The Laguerre–Gauss modes [23] form a complete orthog-
onal set of solutions to (3), so we can write

Lz = −i∂/∂φ.

Since the orbital angular momentum can be found di-
rectly from the mode amplitudes, it is suﬃcient to ﬁnd
the modal decomposition of the beam, which we do by
using an overdetermined point-matching method, simi-
lar to the one we have used previously for non-paraxial
beams [24]. Since, for practical computational purposes,

2

the summation in equation (5) must be truncated at a
ﬁnite degree pmax and order lmax, we obtain, for a single
point rn = (rn, φn, zn)

u(rn) =

aplLGpl(rn).

(9)

l=lmax

Xp=0

Xl=−lmax

For a set of nmax points, this gives a system of linear
equations from which the unknown mode amplitudes apl
can be found. The number of points nmax is chosen to
be larger than the number of unknown mode coeﬃcients,
which is (pmax + 1)(2lmax + 1), and apl are then found
numerically using a standard least-squares solver for an
overdetermined linear system.

The use of an overdetermined system eliminates the
high-spatial-frequency artifacts that would otherwise oc-
cur if only the minimum possible number of points was
used. The mode amplitudes could also be found using
an integral transform, but the point-matching method
allows a coarse grid to be used and gives good conver-
gence [24].

The incident beam mode amplitudes are found by ﬁt-
ting to the actual observed beam, and the transmitted
beam mode amplitudes can be found ﬁtting to a calcu-
lated transmitted beam. The observed incident beam can
be used, since the phase can be assumed to be uniform
across the beam. For the transmitted beam, this will no
longer be the case, and the amplitude of the transmitted
beam is found by treating the test object as a pure phase
object of negligible thickness altering only the phase of
the incident beam as it passes through (the physical op-
tics approximation). The torque acting on the test object
is then given by the diﬀerence in the angular momentum
ﬂuxes of the incident and transmitted beams given by
(8). This technique is used to calculate the torque as a
function of phase thickness (ﬁg. 7) and the amplitude of
the sinusoidal variation of torque with respect the angle
of the rod in the elliptical beam (ﬁg. 5).

The orbital torque can also be calculated by assum-
ing that the elongated particle acts as a cylindrical
lens [14, 25, 26]. It can be noted that cylindrical lenses
can be used as mode converters to produce Laguerre–
Gauss beams which carry orbital angular momentum,
also with resulting orbital torque [25, 26]

We have carried out an experiment designed to mea-
sure the orbital angular momentum component of a light
beam, and from this infer the torque exerted by a light
beam on an object in its path. The orbital angular mo-
mentum is detected by a hologram which generates LGpl
modes (say LG0,±2 in the ﬁrst order) from a Gaussian
input beam. The LGpl modes have an orbital angular
momentum component of l ¯h per photon [8], so that an
LG0,2 mode has 2¯h orbital angular momentum per pho-
ton. If the input beam is instead a LG0,±2 then a Gaus-

Since the mode functions LGpl are also eigenfunctions
of the orbital angular momentum operator, the orbital
angular momentum ﬂux is simply

sian is generated in one of the two ﬁrst order modes in
the diﬀraction pattern [20]. Therefore if the input into
the hologram is some arbitrary beam, then by measur-
ing the strength of the Gaussian at the centre of the two
ﬁrst diﬀraction orders, the orbital angular momentum
carried by the LG0,±2 components of the beam can be
determined. Only the Gaussian component in the ﬁrst
diﬀraction orders has a non-zero intensity at the centre
of the spot. In this experiment the arbitrary beam is an
elliptical beam scattered by a phase object. The phase
object is a bar or rod which is at some angle to the major
axis of the elliptical beam. The orbital angular momen-
tum in this beam is a result of the various modes which
compose the elliptical beam and the torque exerted on
the phase object as it tends to align with the major axis
of the elliptical beam. Due to the order 2 rotational
symmetry of the system, the torque will predominantly
be due to the l = ±2 modes.

The pattern for the hologram was generated from the
calculated sinusoidal interference resulting from a plane
wave and a LG02 mode. This image of the pattern was
printed onto ﬁlm using a Polaroid ProPalette 7000 Digi-
tal Film Recorder. The ﬁlm was then contact printed to
a holographic plate that has a thick silver halide emulsion
layer. The developed plate was bleached using mercuric
chloride to produce a pattern which acts as a phase holo-
gram. Images of bars were also made into phase objects
using this same method—the phase picture of the rod was
made from a grayscale image that has a circular proﬁle
(ﬁg. 2).

The experimental setup is shown in ﬁg. 1. A helium
neon laser beam is directed through an adjustable slit
which creates an elliptical beam that is then incident on
a plate. The plate can be rotated such that the phase
image of a rod on the plate can be oriented at any angle
with respect to the beam. The beam then passes through
a second holographic plate which contains a LG02 sinu-
soidal phase hologram. The beam then passes through
a long focal length lens and onto a rotating screen at
the focal point of the lens. A CCD camera captures the
pattern displayed on the screen. The position of the zero-
intensity spots at the center of each diﬀraction order is
noted when a Gaussian beam (that is, an LG00 beam)
is incident on the hologram. The intensity at these lo-
cations is proportional to the power in the mode with
the appropriate angular momentum. This system is cal-
ibrated by measuring the detected signal produced when
the a pure LG mode of known power is incident on the
analysing hologram.

To do this, the slit was removed and another LG02
hologram replaced the phase image of a rod. The ﬁrst
order mode from the ﬁrst hologram, which has a known
orbital angular momentum, was then selected and sent
through the analysing hologram. The pattern in the two
ﬁrst order modes from the analyser was recorded by the
CCD camera.

an ideal scatterer such as our phase image, it will not
be possible to collect all of the scattered light. However,
likeour phase object, the transparent particles usually
trapped in optical tweezers do not have a large refractive
index contrast with the surrounding medium, and reﬂect
little of the incident light; most of the incident light is
transmitted through the trapped particle. Thus, the ex-
periment presented here provides a suitable model for the
measurement of orbital torque in optical tweezers.

IV. RESULTS

The two ﬁrst order modes from the analysing holo-
gram when the input is a Gaussian beam, are LG0,+2
and LG0,−2 modes (ﬁg. 3). However we see that if an
LG02 mode is incident on the analyser, one diﬀracted or-
der from the analyzing hologram ‘ﬁlls in’ to give a Gaus-
sian and the other is transformed into a higher order LG
mode (ﬁg. 4). The ‘ﬁlling in’ is therefore an indicator
of the angular momentum in the incident beam. With a
Gaussian input, which has no orbital AM, two vortices
were produced at the two ﬁrst order modes. So the pixels
on the CCD that correspond to the centre of the vortices
were then monitored, as a signal at these centre pixels
means that the input beam has orbital AM. The LG02
has a known orbital AM of 2¯h per photon, and was used
to calibrate the signal at the centre pixels.

In general, if we consider the measurement of the or-
bital torque acting on an arbitrary scatterer rather than

An elliptical beam scattered by a rod at an angle to
the beam’s major axis has angular momentum due to

the torque tending to align the rod with the major axis.
Monitoring the centre pixels of the ﬁrst order modes from
the analysing hologram, we were able to measure the or-
bital angular momentum ﬂux of the beam, and hence the
torque exerted on the rod. The diﬀerence between the
signal at the two centre pixels shows a sinusoidal varia-
tion as the angle of the bar is rotated with respect to the
elliptical beam in agreement with theory (ﬁg. 5). Since
the torque is proportional to the beam power, we show
the torque eﬃciency, given here in units of ¯h per photon.
This is the ratio of the torque to the power divided by
the optical angular frequency (P/ω).

The torque measured is dependent on the phase thick-
ness of the rod. The phase thicknesses of a number
of rods, that were exposed for diﬀerent periods of time
during the contact print process, were measured using
a Michelson interferometer. The phase object was im-
aged onto a rotating screen and recorded using a CCD
camera. The phase shift of each rod could then be deter-
mined from the shift in fringes of the interference pattern

cular proﬁle rods, with varying contact print exposure times.

(ﬁg. 6).

The rods corresponding to the interference patterns in
ﬁg. 6 were placed in the elliptical beam at 45 degrees to
the major axis of the elliptical beam when the spatial
torque is greatest. Therefore the torque as a function of
phase shift was found (ﬁg, 7).

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We have shown that in the macroscopic environment,
the orbital angular momentum in a transmitted beam
can be measured, allowing the torque on a phase ob-
ject to be determined. The theoretical results show good
agreement with the experimental data.

In this experiment the orbital angular momentum
transfer was found to be as much as 0.8¯h per photon,
compared to 0.05¯h for the alignment due to spin angular

momentum for a rod in optical tweezers with a Gaussian
beam [11]. As the orbital component is of considerable
size it is of potentially useful technological application if
incorporated into optical tweezers. Also, the eﬀectiveness
of this technique to measure orbital angular momentum
allows for complete measurements of the torque in optical
tweezers. So beams that contain an orbital component
are not only useful for micromanipulation, but also the
torques involved can be fully characterised.

We establish the time averaged total force on a subwavelength sized particle in a time harmonic
varying ﬁeld. Our analysis is not restrictive about the spatial dependence of the incident ﬁeld. We
discuss the addition of the radiative reaction term in the polarizability in order to correctly deal
with the scattering force. As a consequence and illustration, we assess the degree of accuracy of
several polarizability models previously established.

In the last years there has been an increase of interest
in the manipulation of small particles by means of the
light Lorentz’s force. For spheres subwavelength radius
the total force due to a light wave is usually split into
two parts from the use of the dipole approximation (cf.
Ref. [1]): a gradient force (p.∇)E, essentially due to the
particle induced dipole moment p interacting with the
electric ﬁeld E; and a scattering and absorbing forces
1
c ˙p × B, where B is the magnetic vector, ˙p = ∂p/∂t, and
c is the speed of light in vacuum. It has been customary
after Ref. [1] to express the gradient force Fgrad as (see
e.g. Ref. [2]):

Fgrad = (1/2)α0∇E2,

where α0 is the particle polarizability, satisfying the
Clausius-Mossotti equation:

(1)

(2)

α0 = a3 ǫ − 1
ǫ + 2

,

a being the particle radius and ǫ denoting the dielec-
tric permittivity. On the other hand, the absorbing
and scattering forces are written in the approximation
of small spheres through the absorbing (Cabs) and scat-
tering (Cscat) cross sections as:

F =

(Cabs + Cscat)

(3)

|E|2
(8π)

k
k

,

where k represents the light vector (k = |k|). On using
the expression of these cross sections in the dipole ap-
proximation, just the ﬁrst term of their Taylor expansion
versus the size parameter, x = 2πa/λ, is usually consid-
ered.3

At optical frequencies involved in many experiments,
however, only the time average of the electromagnetic
force is observed.
In this letter, we establish the form
of the time averaged total force on a particle with-
out restriction on the spatial dependence of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld. Further, we discuss some of its con-
sequences. For time harmonic electromagnetic waves,4
we write E(r, t) = E0e−iωt, B(r, t) = B0e−iωt and
p(r, t) = p0e−iωt, E0, B0, and p0 being complex func-
tions of position in space, and ℜe denoting the real part.
Then, the time average of the total force is:

In this connection, Ref. [5] establishes the average force
on an object represented by a set of dipoles when the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld is a plane wave. We notice that in this
case Eq. (7) reduces to just Eq. (3), in agreement with
Ref. [5]. However, as we shall illustrate next, Eq. (7)
permits to apply the couple dipole method (CDM) to
more complex conﬁgurations like that of a small particle
in front of a dielectric surface, under arbitrary illumina-
tion (see Ref. [6] for a discussion on the CDM for large
particles). Also, the absence of the magnetic ﬁeld B0 in
Eq. (7) eases the computations.

Conversely, when Eq. (2) for the polarizability is intro-
duced into Eq. (7), one obtains for the ith component of
the time averaged optical force:

which is just the gradient force. Notice the factor (1/4)
(see e.g. Ref. [7]) instead of which the factor (1/2) for
non-averaged ﬁelds often appears in the literature (see for
example Refs. [2,8,9]). In agreement with the remarks of
Ref. [10], now the scattering force, Eq. (3), vanishes and
thus, < F > reduces to the gradient force. Therefore,
α0 must be replaced from its static expression (2) by the
addition of a damping term. This was done by Draine,10
who with the help of the optical theorem, obtained:

The existence of the imaginary term for α in Eq. (9) is
essential to derive the correct value for the averaged total
force due to a time varying ﬁeld.

As an illustration, let the ﬁeld that illuminates the

particle be the beam whose electric vector is:

Ex = exp(−x2/2) exp(i(kz − ωt)), Ey = 0, Ez = 0 (10)

On using Eqs. (2) and (10) in Eq. (7), we ﬁnd:

< Fx > = −(α0/2)x exp(−x2)
< Fz > = 0.

(11a)
(11b)

On the other hand, if the correct polarizability, Eq. (9),
is introduced with Eq. (10) into Eq. (7), the total force
is then expressed as:

< Fx > = (1/2)ℜe

(12b)

For a particle with a radius a ≪ λ, e.g. a = 10nm,
at wavelength λ = 632.8nm and ǫ = 2.25, the factor
(1 + (4/9)k6α2
0) is very close to one (notice in passing
that the expression used in Ref. [11] for α makes this fac-
tor unity). We thus see that in contrast to Eqs. (11), the
correct form for the polarizability, Eq. (9), leads to a total
force given by Eqs. (12a) and (12b), which can be associ-
ated to the gradient and scattering components, namely,
to the time average of Eq. (1) and Eq. (3) with Cabs = 0,
respectively.

In the case of an absorbing sphere, the dielectric con-
stant becomes complex and so is α0. Then, Eqs. (12)
with a ≪ λ become:

< Fx > = −(1/2)ℜe [α0] x exp(−x2)

The imaginary part of α0 does not contribute to the com-
ponent < Fx >, namely, to the gradient force Eq. (13a).
On the other hand the absorbing and scattering force,
Eq. (13b), exactly coincides with the expression obtained
from Eq. (3).

FIG. 2. a) Relative diﬀerence between the component of
the force perpendicular to the incident wave vector obtained
from CDM and by the dipole approximation: CM-RR (full
line), LAK (thick line), DB (dashed line). The sphere is
of glass (ǫ = 2.25) illuminated by an incident evanescent
wave (λ =600nm). b) Same as Fig. 2a for a silver sphere
(λ =400nm, ǫ = −4 + i0.7).

We next illustrate the above arguments with some nu-
merical calculations that permit us to assess the degree
of accuracy of several polarizability models previously
established. We ﬁrst compare the relative diﬀerence be-
tween the force obtained from the exact Mie calculation
and the most usual polarizabilities models, namely, those
of Lakhtakia12 (LAK), Dungey and Bohren13 (DB), and
the Clausius-Mossotti relation with the radiative reaction
term (CM-RR)10 previously discussed, versus the radius
a of a sphere illuminated by a plane propagating wave in
free space (Fig. 1a and 1b). Secondly, when this sphere
is illuminated by an evanescent wave created by total in-
ternal reﬂection on a dielectric surface, the component
of the force perpendicular to the incident wave vector
(Figs. 2a and 2b) is compared with the result derived

2

from the CDM (as discussed in Ref. [6]). All curves are
represented up to a = λ/10. The relative diﬀerence (%)
plotted is deﬁned as: 100 × (Fref − Fpol.)/Fref where
pol denotes the force obtained from the corresponding
method used for the polarizability (among LAK, DB,
CM-RR) and ref stands for the force derived from the
Mie calculation when the incident wave is propagating,
and from the CDM when the incident wave is evanescent.
We ﬁrst consider a dielectric sphere (glass, ǫ = 2.25)
illuminated at λ = 600nm (Figs. 1a and 2a). We ob-
serve that, for an incident propagating wave (Fig. 1a),
the result from the CM-RR relation is better than that
of DB, and this, in turn, is better than the result from
LAK. The force over a dielectric particle given by the ex-
act Mie calculation is: F = Cscat(1 − cos θ)|E|2/(8π),
and that obtained from the dipole approximation is:
F = (1/2)|E|2ℜe[−iα]. When the DB model is used,
then α = (3/2)ia1/k3 where a1 is the ﬁrst Mie coeﬃ-
cient, hence, 4πℜe[−iα] is the scattering cross section
for an electric dipole. However, when Eq. (9) for the
CM-RR is employed, 4πℜe[−iα] constitutes only the ﬁrst
term of the Taylor expansion of the scattering cross sec-
tion versus the size parameter x. This is why Cscat is
underestimated when it is calculated from the CM-RR
model.Therefore, the DB model should be better. How-
ever, in both cases the factor cos θ has not been taken
into account in the dipole approximation and, thus, both
results overestimate the force. Hence, this factor cos θ
makes a balance making the CM-RR result closer to the
Mie’s solution. In the case of an incident evanescent wave
(Fig. 2a), DB and CM-RR results are very close together,
this is due to the fact that the real parts of both polar-
izabilities are very close to each other. We see that LAK
result, as with a propagating wave, is far from the correct
solution.

As a second example, we consider a metallic sphere (sil-
ver) illuminated at λ = 400nm (ǫ = −4 + i0.7). We now
observe that for an incident propagating wave (Fig. 1b),
the DB model yields the best result. The force can ex-
actly be written as F = (Cext + Cscatcos θ)|E|2/(8π). We
notice that now Cscatcos θ is of sixth order in x in compar-
ison with Cext. Since Cext ∝ ℜe[a1] in the electric dipole
limit, the DB formulation appears as the best here. Also,
for incident evanescent waves (Fig. 2b), DB gives the
most accurate solution. However, for a metallic sphere,
the relative permittivity much depends on the wavelength
used, hence, it is now diﬃcult to establish a generaliza-
tion of these results. We have checked, notwithstanding,
that for a gold or silver sphere in free space in the visible,

DB is often the best.

In summary, we have established the average total
force on a little particle in a time harmonic varying ﬁeld
of arbitrary form, and thus clarify its use in the inter-
pretation of experiments, as well as in some previous
theoretical works. For instance, we see that Eq. (7) is
not just the gradient force as stated in some previous
work (see e.g. Ref. [14]). Also, this general expression
shows the importance of the radiative reaction term in
the polarizability of the sphere put forward by other au-
Its derivation makes no assumptions about the
thors.
surrounding environment.
It is just necessary to know
both the electric ﬁeld and its derivative at the position
of the sphere, and thus it allows an easy handling of il-
luminating evanescent ﬁelds. An immediate important
consequence is that it permits to assess the adequacy of
several polarizability models.

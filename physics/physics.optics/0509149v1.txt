Abstract

An isotropic three-dimentional perfect lens based on cubic meshes of interconnected transmission

lines and bulk loads is proposed. The lens is formed by a slab of a loaded mesh placed in between

two similar unloaded meshes. The dispersion equations and the characteristic impedances of the

eigenwaves in the meshes are derived analytically, with an emphasis on generality. This allows

designing of transmission-line meshes with desired dispersion properties. The required backward-

wave mode of operation in the lens is realized with simple inductive and capacitive loads. An

analytical expression for the transmission through the lens is derived and the ampliﬁcation of

evanescent waves is demonstrated. Factors that inﬂuence enhancement of evanescent waves in the

lens are studied and the corresponding design criteria are established. A possible realization of the

structure is outlined.

INTRODUCTION

In recent literature a lot of attention has been given to systems that are able to sense

electromagnetic near ﬁelds (evanescent waves) and even to “amplify” them. The superlens

proposed by Pendry1 is one of such systems. His superlens is based on a Veselago medium2

slab. The real parts of the permittivity and the permeability of the Veselago slab are both

negative at a certain wavelength. Thus, the eigenwaves in the slab are backward waves,

i.e. the wave phase and group velocities are antiparallel. This provides negative refraction

and focusing of waves in a planar slab, as was outlined by Veselago.2 However, Pendry

discovered that there was also a possibility to excite surface plasmon-polaritons on the slab

surfaces and, due to that, amplify near ﬁelds1. The slab thickness can be of the order of

the wavelength, so that the plasmon-polaritons excited at both sides of the slab are strongly

coupled. Under certain conditions the plasmon-polariton excited at the back surface of the

slab has a much stronger amplitude than that at the front surface. Such ampliﬁcation of

evanescent waves is the key principle in subwavelength imaging.

Known experimental realizations of volumetric artiﬁcial materials with negative param-

eters are highly anisotropic structures that utilize dense arrays of parallel thin conducting

wires and variations of split-ring resonators3. Proposed isotropic arrangements use orthogo-

nal sets of split rings4 and also three-dimensional arrays of wires5. At the same time, there

have been achievements in modeling of Veselago materials (and Pendry lens) with the help

of LC-circuits or transmission-line (TL) based structures.6–11 These networks do not rely on

resonant response from particular inclusions, and the period of the mesh can be made very

small as compared with the wavelength. These features allow realization of broadband and

low-loss devices, which is extremely diﬃcult if resonant inclusions are used.

The transmission-line network approach has been successfully realized in one- and two-

dimensional networks, but up to now there have been doubts if it is possible to design a

three-dimensional (3D) circuit analogy of the Veselago medium. The diﬃculties arise from

the fact that such a 3D network requires a common ground connector. Any realization

of such a ground will eﬀectively work as a dense mesh of interconnected conductors that

blocks propagation of the electromagnetic waves practically the same way as a solid metal

does (the structural period must be much less than the wavelength in order to realize an

eﬀectively uniform artiﬁcial material). In this paper we introduce isotropic three-dimensional

2

transmission-line networks that overcome this diﬃculty.

In the TL-based networks that we study, the electromagnetic energy propagates through

TL sections. The inside of every TL section is eﬀectively screened from the inside of the

other sections and from the outer space. This can be very naturally imagined with a 3D

cubic-cell network of interconnected coaxial cable segments: The inner conductors of the

segments are soldered at the network nodes; the same is done for the outer conductors. The

whole system appears as a 3D pipe network where every pipe holds a central conductor and

those conductors are crossing at the node points inside the pipes. A loaded TL network

can be realized now by placing loading elements inside the “pipes”. To couple the waves

propagating inside the TL sections with the free-space waves one will have to apply a kind

of antenna array with every antenna feeding a particular TL segment.

When using transmission lines loaded with bulk elements we speak of waves in the mean-

ing of discrete waves of voltages and currents deﬁned at the loading positions. Let us note

that in the TL sections as such the usual, forward waves propagate. Only because of the

loading the discrete voltage and current waves appear as backward ones when appropriate

loading impedances are used.

While completing this manuscript, we learned about another possible design of a 3D

transmission-line analogy of a backward-wave material described in Ref. 12. That design

is based on Kron’s formal representation of Maxwell’s equations as an equivalent electric

circuit.13 In Ref. 12 only 1D propagation was studied analytically and 3D properties were

analyzed numerically.

II. THREE-DIMENSIONAL TRANSMISSION-LINE NETWORKS

The proposed structure of 3D super-resolution lens consists of two forward-wave (FW)

regions and one backward-wave (BW) region. The 3D forward-wave networks can be realized

with simple transmission lines and the 3D backward-wave network with inductively and

capacitively loaded transmission lines. One unit cell of the BW network is shown in Fig. 1

(the unit cell enclosed by the dotted line). In the 3D structure there are impedances Z /2

and transmission lines also along the z-axis (not shown in Fig. 1).

In view of potential

generalizations, the loads are represented by series impedances Z /2 and shunt admittances

Y, although for our particular purpose to realize a backward-wave network, the loads are

3

simple capacitances and inductances. The unit cell of the FW network is the same as in

Fig. 1 but without the series impedances Z/2 and shunt admittance Y . The equations that

will be derived for these structures can be used in various implementations, but this paper

will concentrate on the case when Z = 1/jωC and Y = 1/jωL.

III. DISPERSION IN BACKWARD-WAVE AND FORWARD-WAVE NET-

WORKS

A. Dispersion equations

First we will derive the dispersion relation for a simpliﬁed 3D BW network, i.e. we will not

take into account the transmission lines. Such approximation is possible at low frequencies.

Without the transmission line segments this derivation is quite simple and can be done by

summing up all the currents that ﬂow to the node (α, β, γ) and equating this sum with the

current ﬂowing to the ground (through admittance Y ), see Fig. 1. The result is

1
Z

(Uα+1,β,γ + Uα,β+1,γ + Uα,β,γ+1 + Uα−1,β,γ + Uα,β−1,γ + Uα,β,γ−1 −

6Uα,β,γ) = Uα,β,γY . (1)

We look for a solution of the form Uα,β,γ = U0e−j~k·~r (~r = rx ~x0 + ry ~y0 + rz ~z0), and if we use

qx = kxd, qy = kyd and qz = kzd, (1) can be reduced to

cos(qx) + cos(qy) + cos(qz) =

+ 3.

Next we want to take the transmission lines into account. The eﬀect of the transmission

lines can be derived by ﬁrst evaluating a part of the three-dimensional network as the one

shown in Fig. 2 and deriving the relation between the current that ﬂows into a node and

the voltages of adjacent nodes.

If current I1 is ﬂowing towards node (α, β, γ) and the current that goes into node (α, β, γ)

k0 in (7) is the wavenumber of waves in the transmission lines. From (5) and (6) we can

solve I1 and I2 as functions of U1 and U2:

U1 = AtU2 + BtI2,

I1 = CtU2 + DtI2,

Next we can derive two equations for the current ﬂowing through the series impedance Z

and solve U2 from both of them:

If we let U2 in both equations be equal, we can solve U3 as a function of U1 and U4:

I3 = Z −1(U2 −

In order to derive an equation for Iz [the current that ﬂows into node (α, β, γ) from the

direction of node (α, β, γ

If we use U1 = Uα,β,γ−1 and U4 = Uα,β,γ, then Iz = SBWUα,β,γ−1 + KBWUα,β,γ. Because of

the symmetry we can derive the dispersion relation exactly the same way as in (1) – (4),

and for the case Z = 1/jωC, Y = 1/jωL the result is

where

(23)

Dispersion curves for backward-wave and forward-wave networks can be plotted if the

values of the transmission line parameters and L and C are ﬁxed. Let us choose the param-

eters of the TLs and the lumped components as: L = 10 nH, C = 5 pF, d = 0.012 m (the

period of the network), Z0,TL,BW = 85 Ohm, Z0,TL,FW = 85 Ohm (characteristic impedances

of the TLs). See Figs. 3 and 4 for examples of dispersion curves when a z-directed plane

wave is considered (i.e. qx = qy = 0). k0 = ω√εr/c, where c is the speed of light in

vacuum. Notice that the BW network supports backward-waves only in the region where

0.32 GHz

f

0.98 GHz. Above that frequency band and the following stopband, the BW

network works as a normal FW network until the next stopband appears.

By tuning the capacitance C (or inductance L), the stopband between the BW and FW

regions shown in Fig. 3 can be closed, see Fig. 5a, where C = C0 = 4.151 pF. As can be

seen from Fig. 5b, by changing the value of C from this “balanced” case, the stopband is

formed either by moving the edge of the FW region up (C < C0) or by moving the edge of

the BW region down (C > C0).

IV. THE CHARACTERISTIC IMPEDANCES OF BACKWARD-WAVE AND

FORWARD-WAVE NETWORKS

Next the characteristic impedance of the backward-wave network is derived. If we assume

that the interface between the two networks is in the center of capacitor C (see Fig. 2, where

Z = 1/jωC), then we can deﬁne the characteristic impedance as

Z0,BW =

U2 + U3
2I2

=

U2 + U3
2I3

.

First we have to express U2, U3 and I3 (or optionally I2) as functions of U1 and U4. We can use

equations (14) – (16). If we insert (16) into (15) and (14), we ﬁnd U2, U3 and I3 as functions

of U1 and U4. Therefore we can present U2, U3 and I3 simply as: U2 = aBWU1 + bBWU4,

U3 = cBWU1 + dBWU4 and I3 = eBWU1 + fBWU4.

Because U4 = e−jqzU1 for a wave moving along the +z-direction, the characteristic

impedance can be expressed as

Z0,BW =

U2 + U3
2I3

=

aBW + bBWe−jqz + cBW + dBWe−jqz
2eBW + 2fBWe−jqz

where

To derive the characteristic impedance of the forward-wave network, we can use the

equations derived for the backward-wave network if we insert C

in them.

If this

condition applies, we get from (25) – (31):

Z0,FW =

U2 + U3

Z0,BW and Z0,FW can be plotted from (25) and (32) as functions of the frequency if the

transmission line parameters and L and C are ﬁxed. Let us choose the parameters of the

TLs and the lumped components as: C = 5 pF, L = 10 nH, d = 0.012 m, εr = 2.33,

Z0,TL,BW = 85 Ohm, Z0,TL,FW = 70 Ohm (characteristic impedances of the TLs). See

Figs. 6 and 7 for examples of the characteristic impedances when a z-directed plane wave

is considered (i.e. qx = qy = 0). The eﬀect of changing C on the characteristic impedance

can be seen in Fig. 6, and the eﬀect of changing Z0,TL,FW on the characteristic impedance is

shown in Fig. 7. Notice that for the BW network the characteristic impedance is continuous

only in the “balanced” case (C = 4.151 pF here), because in the stopbands the real part of

the impedance is zero.

V. MATCHING OF FORWARD-WAVE AND BACKWARD-WAVE NETWORKS

We consider a perfect lens with axis parallel to the z-axis. To have perfect imaging, the

lens should support all spatial harmonics (i.e. waves with all possible transverse wavenum-

bers kt) of the source ﬁeld and for those values of kt, kz,FW and kz,BW should be equal in

11

−

1

magnitude but opposite in sign.

From Fig. 8 we can conclude that the matching of

kz,FW|

|

and

kz,BW|

|

(which corresponds

to a relative refraction index of

1) can be achieved only at one frequency (depending on the

parameters of the forward-wave and backward-wave networks). In Fig. 8 this frequency is

f = 0.7279 GHz. At this frequency the dispersion curves of the forward-wave and backward-

wave networks intersect. In the analytical form this means that

as can be seen from (18) and (23). The dispersion curves in Fig. 8 are plotted so that qx

and qy are zero (a plane wave moving along the z-axis). From Fig. 8 it is seen also that

for f = 0.7279 GHz
value of the maximum wavenumber for propagating waves is approximately 40.6 m−1.

works. C = 5 pF, L = 10 nH, d = 0.012 m, εr = 2.33, Z0,TL,BW = 85 Ohm, Z0,TL,FW = 70 Ohm.

The transverse wavenumber kt = 0.

In addition to matching the wavenumbers (refractive indices), to realize an ideal “perfect

lens” the interfaces between the forward-wave and backward-wave networks should be also

impedance-matched. If the two regions would not be matched, reﬂections from the interface

would distort the ﬁeld patterns both inside and outside the lens. As can be seen from Figs. 6

and 7, the characteristic impedances of the backward-wave network and the forward-wave

network are about 40 Ohms at the frequency where the wavenumbers are matched (and

12

when C = 5 pF and Z0,TL,FW = 70 Ohm). Notice that the impedances of the transmission

lines in the forward-wave network have been lowered from 85 Ohm to 70 Ohm to achieve

impedance matching of the forward-wave and backward-wave networks.

Next the eﬀect of nonzero kt on the matching is considered (at the optimal frequency).

The minimum and maximum values of kt can be found from kt,min =

π/d and kt,max = π/d.

−

From (18) and (23) we can plot kz,BW and kz,FW as functions of the transverse wavenumber
(kt = qk2
kx and ky. By comparing these surfaces, it was seen that they are practically the same for

y) if we ﬁx the frequency. Now kz,BW and kz,FW are surfaces with variables

x + k2

all possible values of kt. This happens only at the frequency f = 0.7279 GHz, where the

dispersion curves of the forward-wave and backward-wave networks intersect.

Because the characteristic impedances are functions of the ABCD-matrices and kz (and

kz is a function of kt), we can plot Z0,FW and Z0,BW as functions of kt if we ﬁx the frequency.

Now Z0,BW and Z0,FW are surfaces with variables kx and ky. By comparing these surfaces,

it was seen that they are almost the same (less than one percent diﬀerence) for all possible

values of kt at f = 0.7279 GHz. See Fig. 9 for a 2D cut of relative diﬀerence between such

surfaces (now ky = 0 and therefore kt = kx). The ideal “perfect lens” situation is achieved

with Z0,TL,FW = 70.59 Ohm, as can be seen also from Fig. 9.

When the frequency deviates from the optimal value (for which (37) is true), the

wavenumbers and characteristic impedances are no longer matched. The eﬀect of this is

distortion of the image seen in the image plane of the lens.

VI. TRANSMISSION OF THE SOURCE FIELD THROUGH THE LENS

The transmission coeﬃcient of the lens can be solved by considering the incident and

reﬂected ﬁelds in the lens system. Let us assume that the incident ﬁeld outside the lens has

the unit amplitude, the reﬂected ﬁeld outside the lens has amplitude R, the incident ﬁeld
inside the lens has amplitude Ae−jkz,BWz, and the reﬂected ﬁeld inside the lens has amplitude
Be+jkz,BWz (z is the distance from the front edge of the lens). From these values we can form

the following equations (the length of the BW slab is l and the transmission coeﬃcient of

the BW slab is TLens, see Fig. 10):

(42)

The total transmission from the source plane to the image plane (see Fig. 10) is then (distance

from source plane to lens is s1 and distance from lens to image plane is s2)

Ttot(kt) = TLens(kt)e−jkz,FW(s1+s2).

(43)

The longitudinal wavenumber kz as a function of kt can be found from the dispersion

relations. Let us choose kt = kx and ky = 0 so we can plot curves instead of surfaces. Ttot

as a function of kt can now be plotted if the frequency is ﬁxed. Let us choose the lengths of

the lens system as the following: l = 0.12 m, s1 = 0.06 m, s2 = 0.06 m. Now we can choose

the frequency at which we want to calculate Ttot.

Let us study the transmission properties at the matching frequency f = 0.7279 GHz.

From (42) and (43) we can plot the magnitude and phase of Ttot as a function of kt, see

Fig. 11, case 1. From Fig. 11 it is seen that the “lens” works quite well for the propagating
40 m−1 < kt < 40 m−1), see Fig. 12 for an example of phase correction in the

According to Fig. 11, for evanescent modes (kt <

41 m−1, kt > 41 m−1) the “lens”

−

works only in a limited range of kt, where the absolute value of the transmission coeﬃcient

Ttot is greater than zero. One can notice that for evanescent modes a mismatch in kz

aﬀects mostly the phase of Ttot in the area of propagating waves and a mismatch in the

characteristic impedances aﬀects primarily the absolute value of Ttot. To improve the eﬀect

of evanescent waves enhancement, the characteristic impedances should be matched better
41 m−1, kt > 41 m−1). There are several ways

in the evanescent wave area of kt (i.e. kt <

to achieve a better matching of the characteristic impedances.

First, there is of course a possibility to change the impedances of the transmission lines,

but this is probably not practically realizable because it would require very accurate manu-

facturing (even a very small deviation from the ideal impedance values destroys the eﬀect of

growing evanescent waves). The tuning of Z0,TL,FW was tested and using the exact impedance

required (see Fig. 9), the transmission of evanescent waves was clearly improved. The reso-

nance peaks in Fig. 11 were moved further away from the center and the absolute value of

Ttot was larger than or equal to unity approximately for

100 m−1 < kt < 100 m−1).

−

Second, there is a possibility to change the frequency and study if the impedance matching

−

16

can be made better that way (this also means that the matching of wavenumbers kz is made

worse which can also destroy the eﬀect of growing evanescent waves). This was tested and

the best results were obtained using frequency f = 0.72905 GHz. The region of transmitted

kt’s was again increased, i.e. the resonance peaks in Fig. 11 were moved further away from

the center and the absolute value of Ttot was larger than or equal to unity approximately

for

100 m−1 < kt < 100 m−1).

−
The third way to enhance the growth of evanescent waves is to change the length of

the “lens”. From (42) it is seen that the growth of evanescent waves is destroyed by the
Z0,BW)2e−jkz,BWl in the denominator. This term can be made smaller by
term (Z0,FW −
decreasing the length of the “lens” l. See Fig. 11, case 2 (
is larger than or equal to

160 m−1 < kt < 160 m−1) and Fig. 13, where the distances equal

unity approximately for

Ttot|

l = 0.048 m, s1 = 0.024 m and s2 = 0.024 m. From Fig. 13 one can conclude that there is a

signiﬁcant growth of evanescent waves in the lens.

By using the shortened lens and at the same time tuning the frequency appropriately, it

was seen that the transmission coeﬃcient could be made practically ideal (i.e.

Ttot|

|

= 1

and arg (Ttot) = 0 for all possible values of kt). Using the shortened lens (same values as

in Fig. 13) and frequency f = 0.7292 GHz, the absolute values of evanescent ﬁelds were

indeed almost the same in the image plane and in the source plane (less than one percent

diﬀerence).

VII. SUGGESTIONS FOR A PRACTICALLY REALIZABLE STRUCTURE

A. Proposed structure

How to manufacture three-dimensional transmission line networks? The main problem

is the ground plane, which should exist in all three dimensions. One solution would be to

use coaxial transmission lines (regular in the forward-wave network and loaded with lumped

L- and C -components in the backward-wave network) as shown in Fig. 14a. This structure

is realizable, but we propose a simpler structure based on microstrip lines, as presented in

Fig. 14b. The problem with microstrip lines is of course the design of intersections where the

transmission lines from six directions meet. This problem can be overcome by using ground

planes which have holes in them at these intersection points. This way the conducting strip

can be taken through the substrate and thus connection of the vertical conducting strips

becomes possible.

B. Simulation results

The proposed structure (see Fig. 14b) has been simulated in Ansoft HFSS (Version 9.2.1).

Due to complexity of the structure and the limited calculation power available, the three-

dimensional structure was simulated only near the ﬁrst lens interface of Fig. 10. The simu-

lated model had 10

unit cells in the backward-wave region. The properties of the transmission lines and lumped

elements were the same as in Fig. 8. The edges of the system were terminated with matched

loads to prevent reﬂections (RBW = 85 Ohm in the backward-wave region and RFW = 70

Ohm in the forward-wave region). Diﬀerent types of source ﬁelds (plane waves with dif-

ferent incidence angles and a point source) were tested and in all cases negative refraction

was observed at the interface between the forward-wave and backward-wave networks at the

expected frequency (f = 0.7279 GHz).

A two-dimensional cut of the proposed structure was simulated as a complete “lens”

system. Again negative refraction was seen at both interfaces, and therefore also focusing

of propagating waves was observed. See Fig. 15 for the plot of the phase of the electric ﬁeld

in the two-dimensional simulation. The source ﬁeld is excited at the left edge of the system

in Fig. 15. When the ﬁeld magnitude

E

is plotted and animated as a function of phase,

|

|

it is clearly seen that the phase propagates to the right in the forward-wave regions and to

the left in the backward-wave region. The energy of course propagates to the right in all

regions.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have introduced and studied a three-dimensional transmission-line net-

work which is a circuit analogy of the superlens proposed by Pendry. The structure is a

3D-network of interconnected loaded transmission lines. Choosing appropriate loads we

realize forward-wave (FW) and backward-wave (BW) regions in the network. The disper-

sion equations and analytical expressions for the characteristic impedances for waves in FW

and BW regions have been derived. A special attention has been given to the problem

of impedance and refraction index matching of FW and BW regions. From the derived

dispersion equations it has been seen that there exist such a frequency at which the cor-

responding isofrequency surfaces for FW and BW regions coincide. Theoretically this can

provide distortion-less focusing of the propagating modes if the wave impedances of FW

and BW regions are also well matched. Impedance matching becomes even more important

20

when the evanescent modes are taken into account. In this paper we have shown that the

wave impedances can be matched at least within 1% accuracy or better if the characteristic

impedances of the transmission lines are properly tuned. However, from the practical point

of view an accuracy better than 1% becomes hardly realizable.

It has been shown that

decreasing the thickness of the BW region reduces the negative eﬀect of the impedance mis-

match, while the ampliﬁcation of the evanescent modes is preserved. We have also outlined

a couple of prospective designs of the perfect lens discussed in this paper and numerically

simulated their performance.

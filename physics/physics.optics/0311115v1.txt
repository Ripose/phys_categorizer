Abstract

We present a numerical investigation of the ray dynamics in a paraxial optical cavity
when a ray splitting mechanism is present. The cavity is a conventional two-mirror stable
resonator and the ray splitting is achieved by inserting an optical beam splitter perpendic-
ular to the cavity axis. We show that depending on the position of the beam splitter the
optical resonator can become unstable and the ray dynamics displays a positive Lyapunov
exponent.

1 INTRODUCTION

A beam splitter (BS) is an ubiquitous optical device in wave optics experiments, used e.g.,

for optical interference, homodyning, etc. In the context of geometrical optics, light rays are

split into a transmitted and reﬂected ray by a BS. Ray splitting provides an useful mechanism

to generate chaotic dynamics in pseudointegrable1 and soft-chaotic2, 3 closed systems. In this

paper we exploit the ray splitting properties of a BS in order to build an open paraxial cavity

which shows irregular ray dynamics as opposed to the regular dynamics displayed by a paraxial

cavity when the BS is absent.

Optical cavities can be classiﬁed as stable or unstable depending on the focussing properties

of the elements that compose it.4 An optical cavity formed by 2 concave mirrors of radii R

separated by a distance L is stable when L < 2R and unstable otherwise.

injected inside the cavity through one of the mirrors it will remain conﬁned indeﬁnitely inside

the cavity when the conﬁguration is stable but it will escape after a ﬁnite number of bounces

when the cavity is unstable (this number depends on the degree of instability of the system).

Both stable and unstable cavities have been extensively investigated since they form the basis

of laser physics.4 Our interest is in a composite cavity which has both aspects of stability

and instability. The cavity is made by two identical concave mirrors of radii R separated by

a distance L, where L < 2R so that the cavity is globally stable. We then introduce a beam

splitter (BS) inside the cavity, oriented perpendicular to the optical axis (Fig 1). In this way

the BS deﬁnes two subcavities. The main idea is that depending on the position of the BS the

left (right) subcavity becomes unstable for the reﬂected rays when L1 (L2) is bigger than R,

whereas the cavity as a whole remains always stable (L1 + L2 < 2R) (Fig. 2).

Our motivation to address this system originates in the nontrivial question whether there

will be a balance between trapped rays and escaping rays. The trapped rays are those which

bounce inﬁnitely long in the stable part of the cavity, while the escaping ones are those which

stay for a ﬁnite time, due to the presence of the unstable subcavity. If such balance exists it

could eventually lead to transient chaos since it is known in literature that instability (positive

Lyapunov exponents) and mixing (conﬁnement inside the system) form the skeleton of chaos.5

The BS is modelled as a stochastic ray splitting element2 by assuming the reﬂection and trans-

mission coeﬃcients as random variables. Within the context of wave optics this model cor-

responds to the neglect of all interference phenomena inside the cavity; this would occur, for

instance when one injects inside the cavity a wave packet (or cw broad band light) whose lon-

gitudinal coherence length is very much shorter than the smallest characteristic length of the

cavity. The stochasticity is implemented by using a Monte Carlo method to determine whether

the ray is transmitted or reﬂected by the BS.2 When a ray is incident on the ray splitting surface

of the BS, it is either transmitted through it with probability p or reﬂected with probability

1 − p, where we will assume p = 1/2, i.e. we considered a 50%/50% beam splitter (Fig 3).

2

We then follow a ray and at each reﬂection we use a random number generator with a uniform

distribution to randomly decide whether to reﬂect or transmit the incident ray.

Our system bears a close connection with the stability of a periodic guide of paraxial lenses as

studied by Longhi.6 While in his case a continuous stochastic variable ǫn represents a pertur-

bation of the periodic sequence along which rays are propagated, in our case we have a discrete

stochastic parameter pn which represents the response of the BS to an incident ray. As will be

shown in section II, this stochastic parameter can take only two values, either 1 for transmitted

rays or -1 for reﬂected ray; in this sense, our system (as displayed in Fig.4) is a surprisingly

simple realization of a bimodal stochastic paraxial lens guide.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In section II we describe the ray limit, and the

paraxial map or ABCD matrix associated with rays that propagate very close to the axis of

the cavity. In section III we present the results of the numerical simulations for the paraxial

map associated with our ray optical system; these simulations are based on standard numerical

tools developed in non-linear dynamics theory. Finally, in section IV, we detail the conclusions

of our work.

2 Ray Dynamics and the Paraxial Map

The time evolution of a laser beam inside a cavity can be approximated classically by using

the ray optics limit, where the wave nature of light is neglected. Generally, in this limit the

propagation of light in a uniform medium is described by rays which travel in straight lines,

and which are either sharply reﬂected or refracted when they hit a medium with a diﬀerent re-

fractive index. To fully characterize the trajectory of a ray in a strip resonator or in a resonator

with rotational symmetry around the optical axis, we choose a reference plane z = constant

(perpendicular to the optical axis ˆz), so that a ray is speciﬁed by two parameters: the height q

above the optical axis and the angle θ between the trajectory and the same axis. Therefore we

can associate a ray of light with a two dimensional vector ~r = (q, θ). This is illustrated in the

3

two mirror cavity show in Fig. 3, where the reference plane has been chosen to coincide with

the beam splitter (BS). Given such a reference plane z, which is also called Poincar´e Surface

of Section (SOS),7 a round trip (evolution between two successive reference planes) of the ray

inside the cavity can be calculated by the monodromy matrix Mn, in other words ~rn+1 = Mn~rn,

where the index n determines the number of round trips. The monodromy matrix Mn describes

the linearized evolution of a ray that deviates from a reference periodic orbit. A periodic orbit

is said to be stable if |TrMn| < 2. In this case nearby rays oscillate back and forth around the

stable periodic orbit with bounded displacements both in q and θ. On the other hand when

|TrMn| ≥ 2 the orbit is said to be unstable and rays that are initially near this reference orbit

become more and more displaced from it.

For paraxial trajectories, where the angle of propagation relative to the axis is taken to be
very small (i.e. sin(θ) ∼= tan(θ) ∼= θ), the reference periodic trajectory coincides with the optical

axis and the monodromy matrix is identical to the ABCD matrix of the system. The ABCD

matrix or paraxial map of an optical system is the simplest model one can use to describe

the discrete time evolution of a ray in the optical system.4 Perhaps the most interesting and

important application of ray matrices comes in the analysis of periodic focusing (PF) systems

in which the same sequence of elements is periodically repeated many times down in cascade.

An optical cavity provides a simple way of recreating a PF system, since we can think of a

cavity as a periodic series of lenses (see Fig 4). In the framework of geometric ray optics, PF

systems are classiﬁed, as are optical cavities, as either stable or unstable.

Without essential loss of generality we restrict ourselves to the case of a symmetric cavity (i.e.

two identical spherical mirrors of radius of curvature R). We take the SOS coincident with the

surface of the BS. After intersecting a given reference plane zi, a ray is transmitted (reﬂected),

it will undergo a free propagation over a distance L2 (L1), followed by a reﬂection on the curved

mirror M2 (M1), and continue propagating over the distance L2 (L1), to hit the surface of the

4

beam splitter again at zi+1. In Fig 4 the sequence of zi represents the successive reference planes

after a round trip. In the paraxial approximation each round trip (time evolution between two

successive intersections of a ray with the beam splitter) is represented by:

qn+1 = Anqn + Bnθn,
θn+1 = Cqn + Dnθn,

(1)

where

and

An = 1 − 2Ln/R,

Bn = 2Ln(1 − Ln/R),

C = −2/R,

Dn = 1 − 2Ln/R

Ln =

L + pna
2

.

We have deﬁned L = L1 + L2 and a = L2 − L1; the stochastic parameter pn = ±1 determines

whether the ray is transmitted (pn = 1) or is reﬂected (pn = −1).

The elements of the ABCD matrix depend on n because of the stochastic response of the

BS, which determines the propagation for the ray in subcavities of diﬀerent length (either L1

or L2). In this way a random sequence of reﬂections (pn = 1) and transmissions (pn = −1)

represents a particular geometrical realization of a focusing system. If we want to study the

evolution of a set of rays injected in the cavity with diﬀerent initial conditions (q0, θ0), we

have two possibilities, either use the same random sequence of reﬂections and transmissions

for all rays in the set or use a diﬀerent random sequence for each ray. In the latter case, we

are basically doing an ensemble average over diﬀerent geometrical conﬁgurations of focusing

systems. As we shall see later it is convenient, for computational reasons, to adopt the second

method.

In the next section we report several dynamical quantities that we have numerically calcu-

lated for paraxial rays in this system, using the map described above (Eq.1) . The behavior

5

of these quantities, namely, the SOSs, the exit basins, the Lyapunov exponent and the escape

rate, is analyzed as a function of the displacement (∆) of the BS with respect to the center of

the cavity (see Fig.1).

3 Results

The paraxial map of Eq.1 describes an unbounded system, that is rays are allowed to go in-

ﬁnitely far from the cavity axis.

In order to describe a physical paraxial cavity we have to

keep the phase space bounded, i.e.

it is necessary to artiﬁcially introduce boundaries for the

position and the angle of the ray.8 The phase space boundaries that we have adopted to decide

whether a ray has escaped after a number of bounces or not is the beam waist (w0) and the

diﬀraction half-angle (Θ0) of a gaussian beam conﬁned in a globally stable two-mirror cavity.

half-angle Θ0 = arctan( λLight

and λLight = 500nm, from which follows that w0 = 5.3 × 10−5m and Θ0 = 0.15 × 10−3rad.

One should keep in mind that this choice is somewhat arbitrary and other choices are certainly

possible. The eﬀect of this arbitrariness on our results will be discussed in detail in section D.

3.1 Poincar´e surface of section (SOS)

We have ﬁrst calculated the SOS for diﬀerent positions of the BS. In order to get a qualitative

idea of the type of motion, we have chosen as transverse phase space variables y = q and

vy = sin(θ) ≈ θ. The successive intersections of a trajectory with initial transverse coordinates
q0 = 1 × 10−5m, θ0 = 0 are represented by the diﬀerent black points in the surface of section.

The diﬀerent SOSs are shown in Fig 5. In Fig.5 (a) we show the SOS for ∆ = 0, while in (b)
∆ = 1 × 10−3m and in (c) ∆ = 2 × 10−2m. In (a) it is clear that the motion is completely

regular (non-hyperbolic); the on-axis trajectory represents an elliptic ﬁxed point for the map.

6

In (b), where the BS is slightly displaced from the center (∆ = 1 × 10−3m) we can see that this

same trajectory becomes unstable because of the presence of the BS, and spreads over a ﬁnite

region of the phase space to escape after a large number of bounces (n = 5 × 104). In this case

we may qualify the motion as azimuthally ergodic. The fact that the ray-splitting mechanism

introduced by the BS produces ergodicity is a well known result2 for a closed billard. We ﬁnd

here an analogue phenomenon, with the diﬀerence that in our case the trajectory does not ex-

plore uniformly (but only azimuthally) the available phase space, because the system is open.

Finally, in (c) we see that the ﬁxed point in the origin becomes hyperbolic, and the initial orbit

escapes after relatively few bounces (n = 165).

3.2 Exit basin diagrams

It is well known that chaotic hamiltonian systems with more than one exit channel exhibit

irregular escape dynamics which can be displayed, e.g., by plotting the exit basin.9 For our

open system we have calculated the exit basin diagrams for three diﬀerent positions of the

BS (Fig.6). These diagrams can be constructed by deﬁning a ﬁne grid (2200 × 2200) of initial

conditions (q0, θ0). We then follow each ray for a suﬃcient number of bounces so that it escapes

from the cavity. When it escapes from above (θn > 0) we plot a black dot in the corresponding

initial condition, whereas when it escapes from below (θn < 0) we plot a white dot.

In Fig.6 (a) we show the exit basins for ∆ = 0.025m, the uniformly black or white regions of

the plot correspond to rays which display a regular dynamics before escaping, and the dusty

region represents the portion of phase space where there is sensitivity to initial conditions. In

Fig. 6 (b), we show the same plot for ∆ = 0.05m, and in (c) for ∆ = 0.075m.

The exit basins plots in Fig.6 illustrate how the scattering becomes more irregular as the BS is

displaced from the center. In particular, we see how regions of regular and irregular dynamics

become more and more interwoven as ∆ increases. Instead, for small values of ∆ as in Fig 6(a),

7

we can see that there is a single dusty region with a uniform distribution of white and black

dots in which no islands of regularity are present.

3.3 Escape rate and Lyapunov exponent

The next dynamical quantities we have calculated are the escape rate γ and the Lyapunov

exponent λ. The escape rate is a quantity that can be used to measure the degree of openness

of a system.8 For hard chaotic systems (hyperbolic), the number Nn of orbits still contained in

the phase space after a long time (measured in number of bounces n) decreases as N0 exp(−γn),

while for soft chaotic systems, the stickiness to Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) islands (or
islands of stability) leads to a power law decay N0n−γ.10 The Lyapunov exponent is the rate

of exponential divergence of nearby trajectories.

Since both λ and γ are asymptotic quantities they should be calculated for very long times.

In our system long living trajectories are rare, and in order to pick them among the grid of

initial conditions N0 one has to increase N0 beyond the computational capability. To overcome

this diﬃculty we choose a diﬀerent random sequence for each initial condition.

In this way

we greatly increase the probability of picking long living orbits given by particularly stable

random sequences. These long living orbits in turn make possible the calculation of asymptotic

quantities such as λ or γ.

The escape rate γ was determined measuring Nn, as the slope of a linear ﬁt in the Nn/N0

versus n curve, in a logarithmic scale; the total number of initial conditions N0 being chosen

as 2200 × 2200.

We have calculated the dependence of γ with the displacement ∆ of the BS from the center of

the cavity, where 0 ≤ ∆ ≤ L/2. Since for ∆ > R − L/2 the left subcavity becomes unstable,

it would seem natural to expect that this position of the BS would correspond to a critical

point. However, we have found by explicit calculation of both the Lyapunov exponent and

8

the escape rate, that such a critical point does not manifest itself in a sharp way, rather we

have observed a ﬁnite transition region (as opposed to a single point) in which the functional

dependence of λ and γ change in a smooth way. In Fig 7 (a) we show the typical behavior

of Nn

N0 vs n in semi-logarithmic plot for three diﬀerent positions of the BS. The displacement

of the BS is ∆ = 0.0875m, 0.05m and 0.03125m, and the corresponding slopes (escape rate γ
measured in units of the inverse number of bounces n) of the linear ﬁt are γ = 0.17693n−1,
0.05371n−1 and 0.01206n−1 respectively. We have found that the decay is exponential only up

to a certain time (approximately 70-1000 bounces depending on the geometry of the cavity)

due the discrete nature of the grid of initial conditions.

In Fig 7 (b) we see that γ increases with ∆, revealing that for more unstable conﬁgurations

there is a higher escape rate, as expected. Its also interesting to notice that the exponential

decay ﬁts better when the beam splitter is further from the center position, since this leads to

smaller stability of the periodic orbits of the system. However, the dependence of the escape

rate with the position of the BS is smooth and reveals that the only critical displacement, where

the escape rate becomes positive, is ∆ = 0.

As a next step, we have calculated the Lyapunov exponent λ for the paraxial map; λ

is a quantity that measures the degree of stability of the reference periodic orbit. For a two-

dimensional hamiltonian map there are two Lyapunov exponents (λ1, λ2) such that λ1 + λ2 = 0.

In the rest of the paper we shall indicate with λ the positive Lyapunov exponent which quantiﬁes

the exponential sensitivity to the initial conditions. We have calculated λ for the periodic orbit

on axis, using the standard techniques,11 and we have found that the Lyapunov exponent grows

from zero with the distance of the BS to the center (Fig 7 (c)). Therefore, the only critical point

revealed by the ray dynamics is again the center of the cavity (∆ = 0), where the magnitudes

change from zero to a positive value. This result also shows that the presence of the BS with its

stochastic nature introduces exponential sensitivity to initial conditions in the system for every

∆ 6= 0, even when both subcavities are stable. This surprising fact can be explained by taking

9

into account the well known probabilistic theorem by Furstenberg on the asymptotic limit of

the rate of growth of a product of random matrices (PRM).12 From this theorem we expect that

the asymptotic behavior of the product Mn of a uniform sequence ω of independent, random,

unimodular, D × D matrices, and for any nonzero vector ~y ∈ ℜD:

lim
n→∞

1
n

hln |Mn~y|i = λ1 > 0,

(2)

where λ1 is the maximum Lyapunov characteristic exponent of the system, and the angular

bracket indicates the average over the ensemble Ω of all possible sequences ω. This means that

for PRM the Lyapunov exponent is a nonrandom positive quantity. In general, it can be said
that there is a subspace Ω∗ of random sequences which has a full measure (probability 1) over

the whole space of sequences Ω for which nearby trajectories deviate exponentially at a rate λ1.

Although there exist very improbable sequences in Ω which lead to a diﬀerent asymptotic limit,

they do not change the logarithmic average (Eq.2).13 We have veriﬁed this result, calculating

the value of λ for diﬀerent random sequences ωi, in the asymptotic limit n = 100000 bounces,

and we obtained in all cases the same Lyapunov exponent.

3.4 Mixing properties

Dynamical randomness is characterized by a positive Kolmogorov-Sinai (KS) entropy per unit

time hKS.14 In closed systems, it is known that dynamical randomness is a direct consequence

of the exponential sensitivity to initial conditions given by a positive Lyapunov exponent. On

the other hand, in open dynamical systems with a single Lyapunov exponent λ, the exponential

sensitivity to initial conditions can be related to hKS through the escape rate γ, by the relation:15

λ = hKS + γ.

(3)

This formula reveals the fact that in an open dynamical system the exponential sensitivity to

initial conditions induces two eﬀects: one is the escape of trajectories out of the neighborhood of

10

the unstable reference periodic orbit at an exponential rate γ, and the other one is a dynamical

randomness because of transient chaotic motion near this unstable orbit.15 This dynamical

randomness is a measure of the degree of mixing of the system and as mentioned before is

quantiﬁed by hKS. Therefore, for a given λ, the larger the mixing is, the smaller the escape

rate, and vice versa. From Figs.7(b,c) it is evident that the Lyapunov exponent and the escape

rate have the same smooth dependence on the BS displacement ∆ and that γ ≤ λ. We have

calculated the diﬀerence λ − γ > 0 for our system and the result is shown in Fig7 (d).

The actual value of γ(∆) depends, for a ﬁxed value of ∆, on the size of the phase space

accessible to the system,8 that is, it depends on w0 and θ0. We veriﬁed this behavior by

successively decreasing w0 and θ0 by factors of 10 (see Table 1), and calculating γ for each

of these phase space boundaries. It is clear from these results that γ increases when the size

of phase space decreases; in fact for w0, θ0 ≈ 0, one should get λ ≈ γ and the cavity mixing

property should disappear. It is important to notice that the increment of γ with the inverse

of the size of the accessible phase space is a general tendency, independent from the arbitrarily

chosen boundaries.

tends to the corresponding value of λ(∆) = 0.29178n−1. In these calculations the displacement
of the BS was ∆ = 0.0875m.

It is important to stress that, although the randomness introduced by the stochastic BS is

obviously independent from the cavity characteristics, λ and γ show a clear dependance on the

BS position. When the BS is located at the center of the cavity it is evident for geometrical

reasons that the ray splitting mechanism becomes ineﬀective: λ = 0 = γ. These results conﬁrm

what we have already shown in the SOS (Fig. 4).

4 CONCLUSIONS

We have been able to characterize the ray dynamics of our optical cavity with ray splitting by

using standard techniques in nonlinear dynamics. In particular we have found, both through

the SOS and the exit basin diagrams, that the stochastic ray splitting mechanism destroys the

regular motion of rays in the globally stable cavity. The irregular dynamics introduced by the

beam splitter was quantiﬁed by calculating the Lyapunov exponent λ; it grows from zero as

the beam splitter is displaced from the center of the cavity. Therefore, the center of the cavity

constitutes the only point where the dynamics of the rays is not aﬀected by the stochasticity of

the BS. The escape rate γ has been calculated and it has revealed a similar dependence with

the position of the beam splitter to that of λ. Furthermore, we have veriﬁed that the absolute

value of the escape rate tends to that of the Lyapunov exponent as the size of the available

phase space goes to zero. This result conﬁrms the fact that the escape rate and therefore the

mixing properties of a map depend sensitively on the choice of the boundary.8 Because of this

dependence we cannot claim that our system is chaotic, despite the positiveness of λ. However,

in a future publication we shall demonstrate that ray chaos can be achieved for the same class

of optical cavities when non-paraxial ray dynamics is allowed.16

Figure 7:
(a) Linear ﬁts used to calculate the escape rate for three diﬀerent geometrical
conﬁgurations of the cavity given by ∆ = 0.03125m, ∆ = 0.05m and ∆ = 0.0875m. The time is
measured in number of bounces [n]. The slope γ is in units of the inverse of time [n−1]. Fig (b)
shows the escape rate γ [n−1] as a function of ∆. Fig. (c) corresponds to diﬀerent Lyapunov
exponents λ [n−1] as the BS moves from the center ∆ = 0 to the leftmost side of the cavity
∆ = 0.10m. Fig. (d) shows the diﬀerence between λ − γ [n−1], which is a positive bounded
function.

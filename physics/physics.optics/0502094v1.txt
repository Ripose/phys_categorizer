Radiation Properties of One-Dimensional
Quasirandom Antenna Arrays Based on
Rudin-Shapiro Sequences

Abstract

The development of exotic new materials, such as metamaterials,
has created strong interest within the electromagnetics (EM) commu-
nity for possible new phenomenologies and device applications, with
particular attention to periodicity-induced phenomena, such as pho-
tonic bandgaps (PBG). Within this context, motivated by the fairly
recent discovery in X-ray crystallography of “quasicrystals,” whose
diﬀraction patterns display unusual characteristics that are associ-
ated with “aperiodic order,” we have undertaken a systematic study
of how these exotic eﬀects manifest themselves in the radiation prop-
erties of aperiodically-conﬁgured antenna arrays. The background for
these studies, with promising example conﬁgurations, has been re-
ported in a previous publication [V. Pierro et al., IEEE Trans. An-
tennas Propagat., vol. 53, No. 2, pp. 635–644, Feb. 2005]. In the
present paper, we pay attention to various conﬁgurations generated by
Rudin-Shapiro (RS) sequences, which constitute one of the simplest
conceivable examples of deterministic aperiodic geometries featuring
quasirandom (dis)order. After presentation and review of relevant

based antenna arrays are analyzed, followed by illustrative numerical
parametric studies to validate the theoretical models. Design param-
eters and potential practical applications are also given attention.

1 Introduction

In an ongoing plan of investigations [1], [2], we have recently been concerned
with the study of the radiation properties of structures with aperiodic order.
Interest in this type of geometries is physically motivated by the recent dis-
covery of “quasicrystals” [3], [4], i.e., certain metallic alloys displaying X-ray
diﬀraction properties that are known to be incompatible with spatial periodic-
ity. In electromagnetic (EM) engineering, this has so far produced interesting
applications in the ﬁeld of photonic bandgap “quasicrystal” devices (see the
brief summary and references in [1]).

We have initiated our series of prototype studies with the aim of exploring
the radiation properties of selected categories of aperiodic geometries, rep-
resentative of the various hierachial types and degrees of aperiodic order in
the “gray zone” that separates perfect periodicity from absolute randomness.
To this end, we started in [1] with exploring the basic radiation properties of
two-dimensional (2-D) antenna arrays based on certain representative cate-
gories of “aperiodic tilings” (see [5], [6] for an introduction to the subject).
In parallel, we also began investigating the radiation properties of selected
categories of 1-D aperiodic sequences, which are more easily amenable to
explicit analytic parameterization and can thus provide better insight into
the relevant wave-dynamical phenomenologies. Within this framework, we
explored in [2] the radiation properties of 1-D quasiperiodic antenna arrays
based on the Fibonacci sequence, which admit analytic parameterization in
terms of generalized Poisson summation formulas. In this paper, we procede
along the same route, but focus on the opposite end of the above-mentioned
aperiodic-order “gray zone”, namely, the quasirandom type of (dis)order.
One of the simplest and most intriguing examples is provided by the so-called
Rudin-Shapiro (RS) sequences [7]–[9]. These sequences were developed in a
pure-mathematics context by H. S. Shapiro and W. Rudin during the 1950’s,
pertaining to some extremal problems in harmonic analysis. More recently,
RS sequences have found important practical applications as signal process-
ing tools for spread spectrum communication and encryption systems [10],

2

[11]. Concerning their wave-dynamical properties, available studies are prin-
cipally focused on the transmission characteristics of 1-D RS-based dielectric
multilayers (see, e.g., [12]).

In line with our stated interest in the radiation properties of aperiodically-
parameterized antenna arrays, we concentrate in the present paper on 1-D
RS-based antenna array conﬁgurations. Our implementation via analytic
and numerical studies makes use of well-established spectral and statistical
properties of RS sequences.

Accordingly, the remainder of the paper is laid out as follows. Section
2 contains the problem formulation, with description of the geometry and
review of the basic properties of RS sequences. Section 3 deals with the
radiation properties of representative classes of RS-based antenna arrays; in
this connection, potential applications to omnidrectional and thinned arrays
are proposed and discussed. Conclusions are provided in Section 4.

2 Background and Problem Formulation

2.1 Geometry

The problem geometry, a 1-D array of N identical antenna elements with
uniform inter-element spacing d, is sketched in Fig. 1. Without loss of
generality, the array is assumed to be placed on the x-axis, with radiators
at xn = nd, n = 0, ..., N
1; in view of the rotational symmetry around the
x-axis, we adopt the 2-D polar (r, θ) coordinate system. Neglecting inter-
element coupling, and for an implied exp(jωt) time dependence, the n-th
antenna element complex excitation is denoted by

−

˜In = In exp(

jk0ndη),

−

(1)

where In is a real excitation amplitude which, by assumption, can take on
only two values (denoted by black and white dots in Fig. 1) related to the RS
sequence described below (Sec. 2.2). Moreover, k0 = ω√ǫ0µ0 = 2π/λ0 is the
free-space wavenumber (with λ0 being the wavelength), and η describes the
2(Nd)2/λ0 (Fraunhofer

2.2 Rudin-Shapiro Sequences

Rudin-Shapiro (RS) sequences are two-symbol aperiodic sequences with quasir-
andom character [7]–[9]. In what follows, their basic properties are brieﬂy
reviewed, with emphasis on those aspects that are directly relevant to the an-
tenna array application in Sec. 3 (see [14]–[18] for more details). In its basic
1, 1
form, a RS sequence is generated from the two-symbol alphabet
via the simple recursive rule

Aa =

{−

}

α0 = 1, α2n = αn, α2n+1 = (

1)nαn.

−

Thus, for instance, the ﬁrst ten symbols in the sequence are

1 1 1

1 1 1

1 1 1 1.

−

−

It can be shown that, in the limit of an inﬁnite sequence, the two symbols have
the same statistical frequency of occurrence [17]. Throughout the paper, the
sequence
in (3) will be referred to as an alternate RS (ARS) sequence.
This sequence can also be generated via a two-step procedure involving a
substitution rule deﬁned on a four-symbol alphabet

Another possible construction algorithm is based on the use of the so-called
RS polynomials [11], [16], [19] deﬁned by the recursive rules

Pm+1(ξ) = Pm(ξ) + exp (j2π2mξ) Qm(ξ), P0 = 1,
exp (j2π2mξ) Qm(ξ), Q0 = 1.
Qm+1(ξ) = Pm(ξ)

It can be veriﬁed that Pm and Qm in (6) are (2m

The link between RS polynomials and sequences stems from the polynomial
coeﬃcients pn and qn in (7). For Pm-type polynomials, the coeﬃcient se-
quence coincides with the ARS sequence, i.e., pn = αn, n = 0, ..., 2m
1. For
Qm-type polynomials, the coeﬃcient sequence (technically deﬁned as ARS
Golay-complementary [20]) is obtained in practice by reversing the sign of
the second half (n

The reader is referred to [16], [21], [22] for more details and possible gener-

in

Aa, the upper bound typically behaves like √N log N [14].
From (11), it can be proved that the Fourier spectrum of the ARS se-
quence tends to a constant value in the inﬁnite sequence limit [14], and is
thus devoid of any strongly-localized spectral footprints. Again, this be-
havior resembles the “ﬂat-spectrum” character of white-noise-like random
sequences. For the RS polynomials in (6) and (7), a behavior similar to (11)
is found, with a tighter upper bound [11]

Concerning the BRS sequence in (9), its Fourier spectrum results from

the superposition of a ﬂat background and a periodic distribution (ξ
spectral peaks (see [14], [23] for details). This could be expected by noting
that the BRS sequence in (9) can be interpreted as the superposition of
an ARS sequence and a periodic sequence, whose cross-correlation can be
proved to be zero [17], [18]. Quite remarkably, the BRS sequence exhibits
0, 1
the same Fourier spectrum as a Bernoulli random sequence in

whose symbols are chosen with equal probability of occurrence [23], [24];
these two sequences are said to be homometric [23] in technical jargon.

3 Rudin-Shapiro Antenna Arrays

We now investigate in detail the radiation properties of representative classes
of antenna arrays based on RS sequences. Referring to the geometry in Fig.
1, the RS character is embedded in the array via the excitation amplitudes
In in (2). Two cases are considered: a) ARS sequence (In = αn), and b) BRS
sequence (In = βn). Parametric studies have been performed, with emphasis
on two meaningful array-oriented observables: the maximum directivity DM
and the side-lobe-ratio (SLR) ρS, which can be compactly deﬁned as

3.1 Flat-Spectrum “Omnidirectional” Arrays

αn}
We begin with the class of antenna arrays based on the ARS sequence
in (3). A typical example of the radiation spectrum is shown in Fig. 3 for a
100-element array. As could be expected from the spectral properties of the
ARS sequence discussed in Sec. 2.2, the radiation spectrum exhibits a fairly
ﬂat behavior (no distinct localized spectral peaks) with truncation-induced
rapid oscillations. This results in a radiation pattern with globally “omni-

which are practically independent of the inter-element spacing and phasing.
First, one can show that the radiation pattern satisﬁes the constraint

(18)

In (18), the upper bound on the L∞ norm follows directly from (11). The
approximation for the L2 norm, numerically veriﬁed a posteriori (see below),
is obtained from (17a) by neglecting the ν-summation; this term vanishes
N, and is more generally negligible since – in view
exactly for d = pλ0/2, p
of (10) and (17b), for arrays of ﬁnite but moderate-to-large size – one expects

By comparison with the computed value (via (14)) in Fig. 3 (which is DM ≈
5.7, practically independent of d/λ0 and η), this general bound turns out to
be rather loose. In this connection, much tighter bounds can be established
for arrays based on the RS polynomials in (6). In view of (7), these arrays

can be synthesized from the array factor Fs(ξ) in (2) with In = pn, qn and
N = 2m, yielding radiation patterns of the type

where the upper bound on the L∞ norm now follows from (12), whereas the

which is consequently tighter than the general bound in (19). By this syn-
thesis, one could therefore obtain an antenna array with nearly “omnidirec-
tional” characteristics. Moreover, for the special case of odd-order (m =
2l + 1) RS polynomials, by exploiting the two available degrees of freedom
(d/λ0 and η) to scale and shift the spectral zeros in (13), one can place up
to two nulls at arbitrary directions, while keeping the global omnidirectional
character. Two examples are illustrated in Fig. 4, in connection with 5-th-
order RS polynomials (N = 32 antenna elements). Speciﬁcally, Fig. 4(a)
shows the radiation pattern synthesized with a P5 polynomial, with array
parameters (d/λ0 = 0.83 and η = 0.1) chosen so as to place two nulls at
30o and θ = 45o. Figure 4(b) shows the radiation pattern synthesized
θ =
with a Q5 polynomial, with array parameters (d/λ0 = 0.5 and η = 0) chosen
so as to place a null at broadside (θ = 0). The maximum directivity vs.
the inter-element spacing is shown in Fig. 4(c) for both conﬁgurations. An
essentially ﬂat behavior (magniﬁed by the expanded scale chosen in the plot)
is observed, with computed values very close to the theoretical bound in (22);
this also serves as an indirect a posteriori validation for the approximation
of the L2 norm used in (18) and (21). Clearly, in view of the omnidirectional
character, with the absence of a main radiation beam, the SLR parameter
ρS in (15) is not of interest for this class of arrays.

3.2 Thinned Arrays

Next, we move on to antenna arrays based on the BRS sequence
in (9).
Assuming In = βn in the array factor in (2), and recalling that βn ∈ Ab =

(i.e., antenna elements are either “oﬀ” or “on”), one may interpret this
{
choice as a special deterministic “array-thinning” strategy [13]. Recalling the
spectral properties of BRS sequences summarized at the end of Sec. 2.2, one
can expect a radiation spectrum constituted of an ARS-type ﬂat background
(see Fig. 3) with superposed discrete spectral peaks (grating lobes) typical
of periodic arrays. These features are clearly visible in the example shown
in Fig. 5 for an array with N = 200 featuring Na = 90 “active” (i.e.,
In = 1) elements. Based on these premises, and recalling the symbol equi-
occurrence property for inﬁnite RS sequences, one may anticipate radiation
properties (in terms of beamwidth, directivity and SLR) comparable to those
of a fully-populated periodic array, using nearly half of the elements, at the
expense of a slight pattern degradation (due to the ﬂat background spectrum)
which is however expected (and acceptable) in most typical array-thinning
strategies [13]. In other words, for a ﬁxed number of active antenna elements
Na and array aperture LA (deﬁned as the distance between the ﬁrst and
last active elements), BRS-type arrays could yield an increase by a factor
2 in the maximum value allowable for the average inter-element spacing

Figure 6 illustrates the radiation characteristics of a typical BRS-type ar-
ray with Na = 90 active elements. Speciﬁcally, Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) show the
radiation patterns for average inter-element spacings dav = λ0 and dav = 2λ0,
respectively. Also shown, for comparison, is the reference behavior of a pe-
riodic array with same number of elements and inter-element spacing (and,
hence, comparable beamwidth). As expected, while the periodic array dis-

This is better quantiﬁed in Figs. 6(c) and 6(d), where the maximum direc-
tivity DM and the SLR ρS vs. the average inter-element spacing are shown.
It is observed that the BRS-array characteristics are only slightly worse than
those of the periodic array for dav < λ0, and become almost uniformly better
beyond the critical value dav = λ0 at which the periodic array characteristics
experience an abrupt degradation due to the entrance in the visible range
of the ﬁrst grating lobe (see Fig. 6(a)). This trend holds up to values of
2.2λ0, at which the ﬁrst grating lobe of the BRS array enters the

visible range. Qualitatively similar behaviors have been observed by us for
arrays of diﬀerent size. Some representative results are summarized in Ta-

4 Conclusions and Perspectives

This paper has dealt with the radiation properties of 1-D quasirandom an-
tenna arrays based on Rudin-Shapiro (RS) sequences. Potential applications
have been suggested, based on known spectral and statistical properties of
these sequences. Results so far seem to indicate that RS sequences might
provide new perspectives for the synthesis of antenna arrays.

In particular, the ARS-type synthesis described in Sec. 3.1 might be of
potential interest for smart reconﬁgurable antenna systems where omnidirec-
tional receiving/transmitting features are needed, as a possible alternative
to the code-based synthesis approaches in [25]. Other potentially interest-
ing applications could be envisaged in the area of reﬂect-array synthesis of
“simulated corrugated surfaces” [26] and, more generally, “virtual shaping”
applications in radar countermeasures [27]. In this connection, use could be
made of recent advances in the practical synthesis of artiﬁcial impedance sur-
faces [28] for designing 1-D (strip) or 2-D (patch) planar arrangements based
on suitable “dual” impedance surfaces. Examples are perfect-electric and
perfect-magnetic conductors capable of providing the opposite-sign reﬂec-
tion coeﬃcients which, in a ﬁrst-order physical optics approximation of the
relevant scattering problem, play the role of the ARS excitation amplitudes
in the array factor here. Such structures, currently under investigation, could
yield strong reduction of specular reﬂection and uniform angular distribution
of the backscattered power.

On the other hand, the BRS-type synthesis described in Sec. 3.2 seems
to oﬀer a simple fully deterministic alternative to typical random thinning
strategies [13] for arrays of moderate-to-large size. In this connection, it is
interesting to observe that, in view of the homometry properties mentioned
at the end of Sec. 3, this strategy is in a sense equivalent to a completely
random scheme, in which the antenna elements are turned on/oﬀ with equal
probability.

Planned future investigations involve the extension to 2-D geometries, as
well as applications to reﬂect-array synthesis for radar cross-section reduction

11

and control. Exploration of the radiation properties of array conﬁgurations
based on other categories of aperiodic sequences continues.

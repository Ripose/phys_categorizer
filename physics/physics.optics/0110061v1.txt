The dynamics of light in Fabry-Perot cavities with varying length and input laser frequency are
analyzed and the exact condition for resonance is derived. This dynamic resonance depends on the
light transit time in the cavity and the Doppler eﬀect due to the mirror motions. The response of
the cavity to length variations is very diﬀerent from its response to laser frequency variations. If the
frequency of these variations is equal to multiples of the cavity free spectral range, the response to
length is maximized while the response to the laser frequency is zero. Implications of these results
for the detection of gravitational waves using kilometer-scale Fabry-Perot cavities are discussed.

Fabry-Perot cavities, optical resonators, are commonly
utilized for high-precision frequency and distance mea-
surements [1]. Currently, kilometer-scale Fabry-Perot
cavities with suspended mirrors are being employed in
eﬀorts to detect cosmic gravitational waves [2, 3]. This
application has stimulated renewed interest in cavities
with moving mirrors [4, 5, 6, 7] and motivated eﬀorts
to model the dynamics of such cavities on the computer
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Recently, several studies addressed the
process of lock acquisition in which the cavity mirrors
move through the resonance positions [4, 13, 14]. In this
process, the Doppler eﬀect due to the mirror motions
impedes constructive interference of light in the cavity
giving rise to complex ﬁeld dynamics. In contrast, Fabry-
Perot cavities held in the state of resonance have usually
been treated as essentially static. In this letter, we show
that resonant cavities also have complex ﬁeld dynamics
and we derive the condition for dynamic resonance. Our
analysis is developed for the very long Fabry-Perot cav-
ities of gravitational wave detectors, but the results are
general and apply to any cavities, especially when the fre-
quencies of interest are close to the cavity free spectral
range.

We consider a Fabry-Perot cavity with a laser ﬁeld in-
cident from one side as shown in Fig. 1. Variations in the
cavity length are due to the mirror displacements xa(t)
and xb(t) which are measured with respect to reference
planes a and b. The nominal light transit time and the
free spectral range (FSR) of the cavity are deﬁned by

T = L/c,

ωfsr = π/T.

(1)

The ﬁeld incident upon the cavity and the ﬁeld circu-
lating in the cavity are described by plane waves with
nominal frequency ω and wavenumber k (k = ω/c). Vari-
ations in the laser frequency are denoted by δω(t). We
assume that the mirror displacements are much less than
the nominal cavity length and that the deviations of the
laser frequency are much less than the nominal frequency.
At any given place the electric ﬁeld E in the cavity os-
cillates at a very high frequency: E(t) ∝ exp(iωt). For
simplicity, we suppress the fast-oscillating factor and de-

ﬁne the slowly-varying ﬁeld as E(t) = E(t) exp(−iωt).
To properly account for the phases of the propagating
ﬁelds, their complex amplitudes are deﬁned at ﬁxed lo-
cations, reference planes a1 and a2, as shown in Fig. 1.
(The small oﬀset ǫ is introduced for convenience and can
be set to zero at the end of calculations.)

The equations for ﬁelds in the cavity can be obtained
by tracing a wavefront during its complete round-trip in
the cavity (starting from the reference plane a2). The
propagation delays τ1 and τ2 depend on the mirror posi-
tions and are given by

(2)
(3)

(4)

(5)

c τ1 = L − ǫ + xb(t − τ1),
c τ2 = ǫ − xa(t − τ2).

Then the ﬁelds in the cavity satisfy the equations:

′

E
E(t) = −raE

(t) = −rbE(t − 2τ1)e
(t − 2τ2)e
taEin(t − 2ǫ/c),

′

−2iωτ1 ,
−2iωτ2 +

where ra and rb are the mirror reﬂectivities, and ta is the
transmissivity of the front mirror.

Because the ﬁeld amplitudes E and E′ do not change
signiﬁcantly over times of order xa,b/c, the small varia-
tions in these amplitudes during the changes in propaga-
tion times due to mirror displacements can be neglected.
Furthermore, the reference planes a and b can be chosen
so that the nominal length of the Fabry-Perot cavity be-
comes an integer multiple of the laser wavelength, making

exp(−2ikL) = 1. Finally, the oﬀset ǫ can be set to zero,
and Eqs. (4)-(5) can be combined yielding one equation
for the cavity ﬁeld

E(t) = taEin(t) + rarbE(t − 2T ) exp[−2ikδL(t)].

(6)

Here δL(t) is the variation in the cavity length “seen” by
the light circulating in the cavity,

δL(t) = xb(t − T ) − xa(t).

(7)

Note that the time delay appears in the coordinate of
the end mirror, but not the front mirror. This is simply
a consequence of our placement of the laser source; the
light that enters the cavity reﬂects from the end mirror
ﬁrst and then the front mirror. For δL = 0, Laplace
transformation of both sides of Eq. (6) yields the basic
cavity response function

H(s) ≡

˜E(s)
˜Ein(s)

=

ta
1 − rarbe−2sT ,

(8)

where tildes denote Laplace transforms.

The static solution of Eq. (6) is found by considering a
cavity with ﬁxed length (δL = const) and an input laser
ﬁeld with ﬁxed amplitude and frequency (A, δω = const).
In this case the input laser ﬁeld and the cavity ﬁeld are
given by

Ein(t) = A eiδωt,
E(t) = E0 eiδωt,

where E0 is the amplitude of the cavity ﬁeld,

E0 =

taA
1 − rarb exp[−2i(T δω + k δL)]

.

The cavity ﬁeld is maximized when the length and the
laser frequency are adjusted so that

This is the well-known static resonance condition. The
maximum amplitude of the cavity ﬁeld is given by

Light can also resonate in a Fabry-Perot cavity when
its length and the laser frequency are changing. For a
ﬁxed amplitude and variable phase, the input laser ﬁeld
can be written as

where φ(t) is the phase due to frequency variations,

Then the steady-state solution of Eq. (6) is

E(t) = ¯E eiφ(t),

where the amplitude ¯E is given by Eq. (13) and the phase
satisﬁes the condition

φ(t) − φ(t − 2T ) = −2k δL(t).

(17)

Thus resonance occurs when the phase of the input laser
ﬁeld is corrected to compensate for the changes in the
cavity length due to the mirror motions. The associated
laser frequency correction is equal to the Doppler shift
caused by reﬂection from the moving mirrors

Eq. (19) is the condition for dynamic resonance. It must
be satisﬁed in order for light to resonate in the cavity
when the cavity length and the laser frequency are chang-
ing.

The transfer function C(s) has zeros at multiples of

the cavity free spectral range,

zn = iωfsrn,

which is useful for control system design[18].

To maintain resonance, changes in the cavity length
must be compensated by changes in the laser frequency
according to Eq. (19). If the frequency of such changes is
much less than the cavity free spectral range, C(s) ≈ 1
and Eq. (19) reduces to the quasi-static approximation,

δ ˜ω(s)

.

At frequencies above the cavity free spectral range,
C(s) ∝ 1/s and increasingly larger laser frequency
changes are required to compensate for cavity length vari-
ations. Moreover, at multiples of the FSR, C(s) = 0 and
no frequency-to-length compensation is possible.

FIG. 2: Bode plot of HL(iΩ) for the LIGO 4-km Fabry-Perot
cavities. The peaks occur at multiples of the FSR (37.5 kHz)
and their half-width (91 Hz) is equal to the inverse of the
cavity storage time.

In practice, Fabry-Perot cavities always deviate from
resonance, and a negative-feedback control system is em-
ployed to reduce the deviations. For small deviations
from resonance, the cavity ﬁeld can be described as

E(t) = [ ¯E + δE(t)]eiφ(t),

where ¯E is the maximum ﬁeld given by Eq.(13), and
δE is a small perturbation (|δE| ≪ | ¯E|). Substituting
this equation into Eq. (6), we see that the perturbation
evolves in time according to

Deviations of the cavity ﬁeld from its maximum value
can be measured by the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) er-
ror signal which is widely utilized for feedback control of
Fabry-Perot cavities [15]. The PDH signal is obtained
by coherent detection of phase-modulated light reﬂected
by the cavity. With the appropriate choice of the de-
modulation phase, the PDH signal is proportional to the
imaginary part of the cavity ﬁeld (Eq. (26)) and therefore
can be written as

tics, the Airy function describes the intensity proﬁle of a
Fabry-Perot cavity [16].)

The response of a Fabry-Perot cavity to laser frequency

A Bode plot of Hω, calculated for the same parameters
as for HL, is shown in Fig. 3. The transfer function
Hω has zeros given by Eq. (21) with n 6= 0, and poles
given by Eq. (30). The poles and zeros come in pairs
except for the lowest order pole, p0, which does not have
a matching zero. Therefore, Hω can be written as the

The zeros in the transfer function indicate that the
cavity does not respond (δE = 0) to laser frequency de-
viations if these deviations occur at multiples of the cav-
ity FSR. In this case, the amplitude of the circulating
ﬁeld is constant while the phase of the circulating ﬁeld is
changing with the phase of the input laser ﬁeld.

In summary, we have shown that resonance can be
maintained in a Fabry-Perot cavity even when the cav-
ity length and laser frequency are changing. In this dy-
namic resonance state, changes in the laser frequency
and changes in the cavity length play very diﬀerent roles
(Eq. (19)) in contrast to the quasi-static resonance state
where they appear equally (Eq. (23)). Maintenance of
dynamic resonance requires that the frequency-to-length
transfer function, C(s), be taken into account when com-
pensating for length variations by frequency changes and
vice versa. Compensation for length variations by fre-
quency changes becomes increasingly more diﬃcult at
frequencies above the FSR, and impossible at multiples
of the FSR.

As can be seen in Fig. 3, the response of the PDH error
signal to laser frequency variations decreases as 1/Ω for
Ω ≫ τ −1 and becomes strongly suppressed at frequencies
equal to multiples of the cavity FSR. In contrast, the
response to length variations is a periodic function of
frequency as shown in Fig. 2. For Ω ≫ τ −1, it also
decreases as 1/Ω but only to the level of (1 + F )− 1
2 and
then returns to its maximum value. Thus, at multiples of
the FSR, the sensitivity to length variations is maximum
while the sensitivity to frequency variations is minimum.

Both these features suggest searches for gravitational
waves at frequencies near multiples of the FSR. However,
because gravitational waves interact with the light as well
as the mirrors, the response of an optimally-oriented in-
terferometer is equivalent to Hω(s) and not to HL(s)
[5]. Thus, an optimally-oriented interferometer does not
respond to gravitational wave at multiples of the FSR.
However, for other orientations gravitational waves can
be detected with enhanced sensitivity at multiples of the
cavity FSR [17].

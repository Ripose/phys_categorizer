Polarization dynamics of femtosecond light pulses propa-
gating in air is studied by computer simulation. A rich variety
of dynamics is found that depends on the initial polarization
state and power of the pulse. Eﬀects of polarization on the
plasma and supercontinuum generation are also discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

There has been a great interest in long distance fem-
tosecond pulse propagation in air in recent years moti-
vated in part by potential applications in remote sens-
ing and laser-induced lightning. The ﬁrst experimental
observations [1,2] of highly localized, high-intensity ﬁla-
ments propagating over distances that exceed their cor-
responding Rayleigh lengths by orders of magnitude mo-
tivated the eﬀorts to understand the phenomenon [3–8].
Due to the violent formation process, and the extreme
time and spatial scales of the ﬁlaments, the computer
simulations and analytic approaches turned out to be vi-
tal tools to grasp the underlying physics [9–16]. Several
models have been proposed. The ﬁrst explanation sug-
gested a stationary waveguide formed by competing ef-
fects of nonlinear self-focusing and linear defocusing by
underdense plasma generated in the most intense part of
the pulse [1]. An alternative model employed a notion
of the “moving focus” to explain how the geometrical
focus of a beam is transformed into a long ﬁlament [3].
More recently, a dynamic spatial replenishment model
emerged from numerical investigation by Mlejnek et al.
[9,10]. The essential feature of the femtosecond propa-
gation of infrared (IR) pulses is its dynamics that makes
it possible that the localized ﬁlaments propagate over
long distances and do not suﬀer signiﬁcant energy loses.
The basic mechanism involves a dynamic balance be-
tween the nonlinear self-focusing and defocusing by free
electrons generated via multi-photon absorption by the
high-intensity ﬁlaments. When the self-focusing leading
edge of the pulse starts to generate plasma, it thus cre-
ates a defocusing “lens” for the trailing portion of the

pulse. This has two eﬀects; First, it limits the losses due
to absorption in the plasma and, second, it prevents the
major portion of the pulse from experiencing self-focusing
collapse. After the plasma generating leading portion of
the pulse exhausts its energy, the strength of the defo-
cusing lens decreases, and the self-focusing starts over
again, this time in the “next temporal slice” of the pulse.
The whole process can repeat several times, depending
on the total energy of the pulse. The qualitative features
of the dynamical spatial replenishment remain valid also
in transversely wide pulses, that break-up into multiple
ﬁlaments [12].

Up to the present, most of the work on the exper-
imental side and all numerical studies have been con-
cerned with the case of linearly polarized input pulses.
Recently, Petit et al. [17] studied the eﬀects of the po-
larization on the propagation of femtosecond IR pulses.
They have measured luminescence from the plasma gen-
erated in the ﬁlaments to show that the polarization of
the pulse plays an important role in the plasma genera-
tion. Due to the highly dynamic nature of the ﬁlament
formation and propagation, it is natural to expect a rich
polarization dynamics in femtosecond pulses. In this ini-
tial study, we restrict ourselves to femtosecond pulses
with modest peak powers that retain their initial radial
transverse symmetry and are just suﬃcient to produce
several refocusing events within a single pulse. The ini-
tial polarization of the pulse is varied and the polarization
state is recorded along the propagation path. Our results
indicate a tight correlation between the evolution of the
pulse waveform along the propagation distance and cer-
tain global polarization parameters. Thus, the measure-
ments of the polarization state could provide yet another
tool to extract information on dynamics of pulses as well
as an opportunity to correlate experiment and theory.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
Our basic model is described in Sec. II, and details of
our simulated experiment are given in Sec. III. Plasma
production, polarization dynamics, and the associated
supercontinuum generation are then discussed in Secs.
IV-VI. Finally, our summary and conclusions are given
in Sec. VII.

Since the typical transverse dimension of the self-
focusing collapsing ﬁlaments are a few tens to hundred
microns in the IR wavelength region, it is a good ap-
proximation to consider the optical ﬁeld as transverse.
We describe the complex optical amplitude in terms of
two circularly polarized components, E ±. The choice of
the circularly polarized basis is motivated by the fact
that in this basis the nonlinear birefringence is “diago-
nal” and preserves the power in each component, which
in turn makes its implementation easier. Our model is
a straightforward extension of the scalar version we used
in our previous studies [9,12]. It takes into account the
eﬀects of diﬀraction, normal group velocity dispersion
(GVD), multi-photon ionization (MPI) and avalanche
plasma generation, defocusing of light by the generated
free electrons, and instantaneous and delayed cubic non-
linearity:

In the present model,
we chose the relative weight of the “self” and “cross”
non-linear birefringent terms the same as for the instan-
taneous Kerr eﬀect and nonlinear Raman eﬀect, namely,
the cross eﬀect has a weight twice that of the self eﬀect
as is appropriate for an isotropic medium [18].

where the ﬁrst and second terms represent the avalanche
and multi-photon eﬀects, while the last one models the
plasma recombination. Note, that at the time-scales rele-
vant for the present study, the only practically important
contribution comes from the the multi-photon term. For
the pulse powers we use, it is suﬃcient to include oxygen
alone as a source for MPI, since its corresponding multi-
photon order is lower than that for nitrogen. We use the
Keldysh theory formula to calculate the MPI rate [19].

Explanations of symbols that appear in our model
equations are listed in Table 1 together with the values
used in our simulation.

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATION

To study the role of the initial polarization state of
the pulse on its subsequent propagation, we performed
a series of simulations. In all runs, the initial pulse was
chosen to be a Gaussian wave-packet (in time and space)
characterized through its central wavelength λ = 775
nm, pulse waist w = 0.7 mm and temporal duration
τFWHM = 200 fs. We ﬁxed the initial peak intensity as
1.0×1016 W m−2 which is a relatively modest value: for a
linearly polarized input this corresponds to an input peak
power of P = 7.7 GW= 4.5Pcr, whereas for a pure circu-
lar polarization P = 7.7 GW= 3.0P ±
cr. At these powers,
there are typically two to three refocusing events in the
pulse propagation, and the numerics can be reliably con-
trolled. At higher powers under a perfect axial symmetry
of the pulse, it may be necessary to extend the model be-
yond the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (NLSE), and to
include correction terms that allow to handle pulses with
a very broad spectrum. To check our numerical proce-
dures and model implementation, we performed most of
the runs in two or three diﬀerent resolutions. The data
we present were obtained with the time-domain resolu-
tion of 0.24 fs. This resolution is suﬃcient to capture
spectra several hundredth of nanometers wide. We pro-
vide more details of our testing procedures concerning
the spectral resolution and algorithm validity in Sec. VI
devoted to supercontinuum generation.

Below, we present our results for a series of runs that
diﬀer in the initial polarization state of the pulse. We
change the polarization from the linear, through ellip-
tic to circular, to see how it aﬀects the dynamics of
the ﬁlaments.
In previous work on nonlinear propaga-
tion in ﬁbers, the Stokes parameter formalism has been
employed to classify the polarization dynamics for plane
wave ﬁelds [20]. Here we employ space and time averaged
Stokes parameters (s0, s1, s2, s3) as a description of the
polarization dynamics of the propagating pulses. In par-
ticular, our Stokes parameters are calculated numerically
according to the prescription

s0 = (Fπ/2 + F0)
s1 = (Fπ/4 − F−π/4)/s0
s2 = (Fπ/2 − F0)/s0
s3 = (FCR − FCL)/s0

pulse through a polarizer of state β

with Eβ the ﬁeld resolved along the polarizer direction,
and R the radius of a detection aperture chosen to select
the the most intense region of the pulse around the ﬁla-
ment. For a linear polarizer β is the angle of the polarizer,
whereas for a circular polarizer β = CR, CL correspond-
ing to right and left circular polarization settings. Here
we chose R = 0.1 mm, and perform the measurement of
the Stokes parameters “in the near ﬁeld”. We note that
s0 is the total energy of the pulse detected over the aper-
ture, and the remaining Stokes parameters are calculated
as diﬀerences between the detected energy with diﬀerent
polarizer settings normalized to the total energy. Thus
our prescription has a direct experimental interpretation
and should therefore be of utility. The above prescrip-
tion for determining the Stokes parameters also reduces
to the usual deﬁnitions in the limit of long pulses of broad
transverse extent.

In the numerical simulations to be presented we ﬁx the
initial Stokes parameter s2 equal to zero, and vary s1 and
s3 between zero and one to vary the initial polarization
from linear through elliptic to pure circular polarization.
Besides the polarization state, we also recorded the data
pertaining to the plasma generation inside the pulse, and
generation of the supercontinuum light. We start our
discussion with plasma generation.

IV. PLASMA PRODUCTION

As the femtosecond pulse undergoes multiple self-
focusings, the amount of plasma generated by its high-
intensity portions reﬂects the spatio-temporal shape of
the pulse. The total number of generated electrons as
well as the maximal plasma densities exhibit peaks along
the propagation distance. These peaks coincide with the
locations of self-focusing collapses within the pulse, each
peak being produced by a diﬀerent temporal portion of
the pulse. Figure 1 shows the plasma generation for three
diﬀerent initial polarizations of the pulse. The trend that
one can see is quite in line with what is expected based
on the functional form of the nonlinear birefringence.
Namely, as we change the initial polarization from linear
through elliptic to circular, the amount of the generated
plasma decreases. Also, the onset of ﬁlament formation
is delayed for the circularly polarized pulse because the
critical power for self-focusing is higher for circularly po-
larized pulse as noted earlier. In other words, keeping the

input peak power the same for diﬀerent polarizations,
we eﬀectively decrease the self-focusing power of circu-
larly polarized pulses. This is also the reason why the
number of refocusing events can be higher in a close-to-
linear or linear polarization than in a circularly polarized
pulse. While the overall plasma production depends on
the polarization state, the typical dimensions of the ﬁl-
aments are not very sensitive to it. That can be seen
from the Figure 1 which shows the longitudinal extent
of the plasma columns. The transverse dimensions of
the plasma channels can be estimated from the ratio of
the two curves shown in the ﬁgure as the square root of
the ratio between the total number of electrons and the
maximal plasma density. This characteristic dimension
of the plasma channel is shown in Fig. 2 for three diﬀer-
ent polarizations. Though there are small variation be-
tween diﬀerent initial polarizations, the thickness of the
plasma channels is always roughly 60 microns in the most
dense parts. The plasma channel generated by the circu-
larly polarized pulse seems to be more “homogeneous”,
exhibiting less thickness variation along the propagation
distance.

V. POLARIZATION DYNAMICS

While the dynamics of the plasma generation and its
dependence on the polarization described in the previ-
ous Section is straightforwardly linked to the structure
of the equations governing the optical ﬁeld evolution, the
polarization dynamics seems to be more diﬃcult to in-
terpret. Figures 3,4,5 show the Stokes parameters and
the polarization degree as functions of the propagation
distance for the three diﬀerent initial polarizations we
discussed in the previous Section. An interesting feature
is the diﬀerence between the “stability” of initial linear
and circular polarization. Figure 3 shows that a small
perturbation to the linear polarization in the initial pulse
leads to an increasing deviation of the polarization state
from the initial one. In this sense, the linear polarization
appears to be unstable, as the polarization measured af-
ter the ﬁlament formation can signiﬁcantly diﬀer from
the initial one. Naturally, the rate of divergence for two
close but not identical initial conditions decreases with
the decreasing input power. On the other hand, in the
case of almost circular polarization shown in Fig. 4, the
pulse polarization state doesn’t change that dramatically.
Though there is a small decrease of the polarization de-
gree, one can say that ﬁnal polarization stays close to the
initial one even after two refocusings of the pulse. Thus,
the circular polarization seems to be more stable against
small perturbations than the linear polarization. Figure 5
shows an interesting case of an initially elliptic polariza-
tion. Note that the Stokes parameter s3, which measures
the degree of circular polarization, only exhibits small
variations, while the other two parameters decrease sig-
niﬁcantly after their initial increase in the ﬁrst collapse.

That means that the light focused in the second collapse
is predominantly circularly polarized. This observation is
conﬁrmed by examining the spatio-temporal polarization
pattern within the pulse. This is an observation that may
not be expected based on the previous results concerning
cw self-focusing of polarized pulses [21,18]. Namely, in
a situation close to a continuous wave regime, one can
argue that the weaker circular component experiences
a stronger focusing “lens” because of the factor two in
the birefringence cross-term, and that eventually leads to
equal intensities of both circular components and, there-
fore, linear polarization of the central ﬁlament. However,
the important point here is that the femtosecond light
ﬁlaments under consideration are extremely dynamic ob-
jects. The resulting polarization distributions strongly
depend on the spatial and temporal location within the
pulse, and any interpretation based on steady-state-like
considerations becomes invalid. Namely, there is a delay
between when the light encounters the focusing “lens”
and when it actually reaches the focus. This delay inter-
feres with the temporal proﬁle of the pulse, which typi-
cally exhibits multiple peaks that may be just a few fem-
tosecond long. As a consequence, the above simple ar-
gument is not suﬃcient to capture all essential features
of the phenomenon. The tendency of the predominantly
circular polarization of the most intense portion of a ﬁla-
ment was also observed in our simulations that were not
restricted to axial symmetry [22]. A wide beam with a
random perturbation breaks up into multiple ﬁlaments
that exhibit polarization properties similar to those we
discuss here. However, one has to keep in mind, that
in both cases, axisymmetric as well as fully spatially
resolved, our simulation modeled pulses with relatively
small energy ﬂuence when compared to some current ex-
periments. Therefore, it would be extremely interesting
to see what happens to the polarization of the central
ﬁlament in a pulse that has enough energy for many self-
focusing events and also has the transverse proﬁle clean
enough to preserve its axial symmetry.

We conclude this Section with yet another presenta-
tion of the polarization dynamics data we have shown
above. Namely, we want to show that the polarization
changes closely reﬂect the self-focusing events within the
pulse and, consequently, the locations where most of the
plasma is generated. Figure 6 shows the root-mean-
square rate of the change of the Stokes vector along the
propagation distance

for the case of elliptic initial polarization of the pulse.
The curve shown corresponds to the data depicted in
Fig. 5 and in Fig. 1b). Note, that the maxima of the
rate of the polarization change closely follow those in
the plasma production curve. We thus see that the mul-
tiple self-focusing events in the single pulse leave their
signature on the polarization. This could provide an-

other way, besides the indirect plasma density observa-
tions [8,23–25], to visualize the dynamics of the spatial
replenishment.

VI. SUPERCONTINUUM GENERATION

After contrasting the behavior of pulses polarized close
to linear and circular from the points of view of plasma
generation and of their polarization dynamics, we want
to discuss the eﬀects of polarization on the supercontin-
uum generation. However, before presenting our results,
we feel a note concerning some technical questions is in
order. The explosive spectral broadening in the super-
continuum generation in femtosecond pulses is a rather
subtle phenomenon from the point of view of numerical
simulation. Clearly, one needs a suﬃcient resolution in
the time (spectral) domain to capture the broad spec-
trum, but the resolution may not be the only issue here.
One has to check how broad is the spectral region within
which the model and its numerical implementation de-
scribes the wave propagation correctly.
It is expected,
that at extreme powers, correction terms beyond the ba-
sic NLSE (see e.g. Ref. [26]) need to be included in the
ﬁeld equation. To ensure that we work in the regime
where the correction terms may be neglected, and to as-
sess the spectral band over which our numerics works
well, we performed some comparative simulations. The
choice of the reference frequency (wavelength) around
which the NLSE is built is in principle arbitrary, though
it is obviously most appropriate to choose it close to the
central frequency of the modeled pulse. This means, that
simulations that only diﬀer in the choice of the reference
frequency should give the same results. We have com-
pared simulation with the reference frequency shift of 150
nanometers oﬀ the central wavelength of the pulse, and
obtained a very close match of the spectra in the region
from 500 to 1200 nm and over four decades in spectral
intensity. Thus, in this interval we can trust the spectra
extracted from our simulations. We would like to point
out that this is in fact a rather strong test for the overall
numerical implementation of the solver. But most impor-
tant, the close agreement between the spectra shows that
the correction terms beyond NLSE do not play an impor-
tant role in our regime of modest input powers; This is
because one can interpret them as corrections that par-
tially restore the invariance of the original wave equation
with respect to the choice of the (physically meaningless)
reference frequency – that is exactly what our test shows
is not needed for the conditions in our simulations.

Figure 7 shows comparison of the spectral broadening
of two pulses that diﬀer only in their initial polarization.
The way we extracted the spectra from the pulse wave-
forms corresponds to measurement in a near ﬁeld with
the same aperture we used for polarization characteriza-
tion. The ﬁgure shows spectra “measured” after the last
self-focusing collapse, after which the pulse will eventu-

4

ally diﬀract and there will not be more supercontinuum
generation. One can see that the pulse which was initially
polarized close to linear exhibits a much stronger super-
continuum generation. However, note that we compare
pulses with the same peak power, and what we see here is
an eﬀect similar to the plasma generation. Supercontin-
uum generation strongly depends on the available power
and the natural measure of that power is in units of crit-
ical power for self-focusing. From that point of view the
circularly polarized pulse is weaker and that is the main
reason that it exhibits less spectral broadening. However,
this situation represents a reasonable experimental setup
in which only the polarization is changed.

To get a feeling regarding the role of the group ve-
locity dispersion in the supercontinuum generation, we
performed most of the simulation runs also with a higher
group velocity dispersion parameter. It turns out that in-
creasing GVD by an order of magnitude leads to a strong
suppression of the continuum production. We speculate
that it may be one of the reasons that, at least in some
experiments, there is only little spectral broadening in
the ultraviolet (UV) femtosecond pulses [27] because the
GVD value of air is signiﬁcantly higher in the UV region.
The ﬁndings from our numerical simulations should
be accessible to experimental testing. However, extreme
caution should be exercised when trying to compare ex-
perimental and simulational spectra. The spectra we
present are taken from “one shot”. They exhibit mod-
ulations typical for supercontinuum generation in gases
[2,28]. While the characteristic “frequency” of the mod-
ulation is rather reproducible, the exact spectral shape
is not. Thus, even small ﬂuctuation in the parameters of
the pulses will result in a suppression of ﬁne features in
the multiple-shot experimental spectra.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have performed a computer simulation study of
the eﬀects of the initial pulse polarization on its prop-
agation and ﬁlamentation dynamics. In agreement with
the experiment [17], we have found that the ﬁlamentation
onset is reached earlier for a linearly polarized pulse than
in a circularly polarized pulse of the same peak power.
However, in some cases, the experiment indicates that
the circularly polarized pulses create higher plasma den-
sities in comparison with linearly polarized pulses. Our
simulations suggest the opposite, but one has to keep
in mind that the experimental measurements and our
simulation pertain to rather diﬀerent conditions, includ-
ing much higher power and focusing in the experiment.
In our simulations, we also see more self-focusing events
with linearly polarized pulses than with circularly polar-
ized ones.

We have observed a rich spatio-temporal polarization
dynamics. Naturally, the limited range of the full param-
eter space explored in our simulations prevents us from

drawing general conclusions, but we believe some tenden-
cies are already discernible. First, the initially circular
polarization seems to be stable in a sense that a small
perturbation of the polarization state doesn’t grow sig-
niﬁcantly. On the other hand, when a small polarization
perturbation is applied to the linearly polarized pulse,
it grows and the polarization degree of the central ﬁl-
ament decreases signiﬁcantly. The growth rate of the
deviation is expected to increase for higher powers. An
interesting case is the one of an initially elliptic polariza-
tion. We have observed that the center of the ﬁlament is
almost purely circularly polarized after subsequent self-
focusing collapses within the pulse. Apparently, we have
here a rather diﬀerent situation than in the self-focusing
in nanosecond pulses, which tend to create linearly polar-
ized ﬁlaments independently of initial polarization state
[21,18]. The usual argument, that the the weaker circu-
lar component experiences stronger self-focusing which ﬁ-
nally leads to balancing the power of the circularly polar-
ized components and thus to linear polarization, can’t be
applied in the femtosecond pulses. The evolution of the
polarization state along the propagation distance is ex-
tremely dynamic and hardly possible to describe in sim-
ple “static” terms. The multiple refocusing within a pulse
and the defocusing eﬀect of the generated plasma play a
major role. The important feature of the whole process
is that apart from the relatively small energy losses due
to plasma generation and radiation, the energy in each
circular component remains conserved. Thus, the main
mechanism that results in changing polarization pattern
within the pulse is the spatio-temporal energy redistribu-
tion within each circular component. As a consequence,
the polarization state of the whole pulse is very compli-
cated and, therefore, any projection onto global quanti-
ties like Stokes parameters has to be interpreted in re-
lation to details of the measurement (aperture, near vs.
far ﬁeld, collecting angle, . . . ).

We have also looked at spectra “measured” after the
last self-focusing collapse for diﬀerent initial polariza-
tions.
In accordance with our observation about the
plasma generation, we see much stronger supercontin-
uum generation in linearly polarized than in circularly
polarized pulses.

Finally, we have seen that rate of change of the polar-
ization state in the center of the ﬁlament is closely cor-
related with self-focusing and plasma generation. Thus,
the polarization oﬀers, in principle, an alternative way to
investigate the dynamics of the spatial replenishment in
femtosecond pulses.

In this work, we have concentrated on investigating
“global” quantities to characterize the femtosecond pulse
propagation that should be experimentally accessible, at
least in principle. Naturally, the question is how much
can be done practically. To measure the Stokes parame-
ters evolution along the propagation distance, for exam-
ple, a very good reproducibility of the initial pulse would
be required. However, the “ﬁnal output” polarization
state and spectra, which should be easier to measure,

5

also carry a lot of signatures about the inner dynamics
of the femtosecond pulse propagation.

FIG. 1. Plasma generation for almost linear (a), elliptic
(b) and a close-to-circular (c) initial pulse polarization. The
total peak power is kept the same in all cases. Since the crit-
ical power for self-focusing is higher for circular polarization,
the circularly polarized pulse experiences weaker self-focusing
which in turn results in less overall plasma generation.

collapse event. Note that the rate of change of the polarization
state correlates with the loci of maximal plasma production
(see Fig. 6).

Abstract

The properties of the hollow beam produced by a conical lens are studied in detail.
In particular, the impact of a rounded vertex is examined. It is shown that it could
lead to drastic changes in the transverse distribution of the hollow beam, determined
by the ratio between the transverse size of the incident beam and the size of the
blunt area. An adequate choice for this ratio allows us to either minimize the losses
or optimize the distribution symmetry.

1 Introduction

Axicons are a family of cylindrical symmetrical optical systems that produce
a line focus rather than a point focus from incident collimated beam[1]. There
are several types of axicons, working either by reﬂection or by transmission,
and being either converging or diverging, but the most common one is probably
the conical lens. Such a lens is a cone made with a material of index n, and a
basis perpendicular to its main z axis (Fig. 1). An incident collimated beam,
propagating along the z axis, is deviated towards the main axis of the lens,
with an angle β = (n − 1) α, where α is the base angle of the cone. α is usually
a small angle, typically few degrees or less. Beyond the lens, two zones must be
distinguished: in the ﬁrst one, just after the lens, all deviated beams spatially
coexist partially (in the hatched zone of Fig. 1), resulting in a diﬀraction-
free beam. Beyond this zone, beams deviated along diﬀerent directions do not
overlap any more, and the intensity becomes distributed on a ring. Such hollow
beams have recently regain interest, in the perspective of their use in optical
trapping of atoms[2–4] and Bose-Einstein condensates[5].

Fig. 1. Schematic behavior, in the geometrical approximation, of a collimated beam
through a conical lens C of base angle α. The propagation axis is the z axis, with
its origin at the axicon vertex. After the conical lens, the beam is globally deviated
towards the z axis with an angle β. Point V is on the axicon vertex, while point X
corresponds to the abscissa z0 where a hole appears in the center of the beam in
geometrical approximation. The hatched zone between V and X is the Bessel zone.
For z > z0, the hollow beam has a radius r0 and a thickness ρ.

These applications require speciﬁc properties, as e.g. a zero intensity in the
center of the beam, as predicted by the diﬀraction theory[6]. However, in most
of the experimental realizations, the obtained pattern is more complicated: a
usual observed defect is a drastic asymmetry of the distribution with a tail
towards the center, possibly secondary rings and thus a non zero intensity
at the center[2]. Practically, this leads to the need of a mask to clean the
inner region of the hollow beam, and thus a loss of light power and additional
diﬀraction eﬀects, which are both major inconveniences in the experimental
uses of such hollow beams. The source of these diﬀerences with respect to
the theory is not clearly identiﬁed. As the conical lens vertex plays a central
role in the transverse distribution of the hollow beam, it is natural to search
for the origin of these defects in the properties of this point, in particular by
taking into consideration its real shape. In the present paper, we study the
modiﬁcations induced by the bluntness of the conical lens vertex on the hollow
beam transverse shape. We show in particular that the ratio between the
transverse size of the incident beam and the size of the blunt area determines
the transverse distribution, and that an adequate choice for this ratio allows
us to either minimize the losses or optimize the distribution symmetry.

2 Geometrical propagation

Fig. 1 describes schematically the geometrical beam propagation through a
conical lens. The diﬀraction-free zone appears between the conical lens vertex
V, and the point X where all deviated beams separate. The spatial distribu-
tion of the light ﬁeld in this zone is the superimposition of the interferences
between deviated beams and diﬀraction on the conical lens vertex V. The
transverse distribution of the resulting ﬁeld follows a Bessel function[7]. Its

2

exact nature depends on the shape of the incident beam. For example, an
appropriate incident Laguerre-Gaussian beam is able to generate a high-order
Bessel beam of arbitrary order[8]. The main interest of Bessel beams is that
they propagate without diﬀraction, i.e. their intensity transverse proﬁle re-
mains invariant upon propagation on macroscopic distances[9]. Bessel beams
produced by axicons have been extensively studied, within the framework of
numerous applications, such as second-harmonic generation[10], optical para-
metric generator [11], and atom trapping [12].

Beyond point X, i.e. for z > z0, with z0 = ri/β, where ri is the radius of the in-
cident beam, all deviated beams separate (in the geometrical approximation),
and a hole with radius R0 −ρ appears in the center of the beam. R0 = βz is the
distance between the z axis and the ray crossing the conical lens vertex, while
ρ is the thickness of the ring (ρ = ri in the present case). It is also practical to
deﬁne the radius r0 of the ring, with r0 = R0 −ρ/2 (Fig. 1). Such hollow beams
are fundamentally diﬀerent from hollow Laguerre-Gaussian modes. First, in
the last ones, the circulation of the phase around the pattern center is equal to
2πl, where l > 0 is the angular index of the mode, while in the axicon hollow
beam, it is equal to that of the incident beam, i.e. zero in the case of a plane
wave or a TEM00 mode. This phase variation has no consequence on the inten-
sity transverse distribution, but is critical in ﬁeld dependent systems, e.g. if
the hollow beam interferes with another beam. The second point concerns di-
rectly the intensity distribution: the axicon hollow beam can be realized with
arbitrary ratio between the radius and the thickness of the beam, as both
quantities depend diﬀerently on z, while in Laguerre-Gaussian modes, this
ratio is ﬁxed by the Laguerre polynomial distribution and does not vary with
z, except of course if it is transformed by an axicon[13]. Axicon hollow beams
can be used in diﬀerent applications, from laser machining[14] to optical traps
for cold atoms[2–4] and Bose-Einstein condensates[5].

3 Gaussian beam propagation

In practical realizations, incident beams are often produced by a laser, and
thus are gaussian beams. In that case, the incident beam cannot be consid-
ered as collimated, but is characterized by a waist w0 where the beam spot
size is minimum. To control the waist location and size, a convergent lens
is usually inserted before the conical lens. In particular, it is easy with such
a doublet to locate the waist after the conical lens. Fig. 2 shows the propa-
gation of a collimated incident beam through a convergent lens followed by
a conical one, in the geometrical approximation. As for collimated beams,
an incident ray at the distance r from the z axis, is deviated with an angle
β, with β (r) = (n − 1) α + r/f , where f is the focal length of the conver-
gent lens. We can also deﬁne a distance z0 such that for z > z0, a hole ap-

3

pears in the center of the beam. For thin lenses, a simple calculation leads
to z0 = ri (f − d) / (ri + (n − 1) αf ) where d is the distance between the two
lenses. As in the single conical lens case, R0 and ρ, which now depend both on
z, can be easily calculated. In particular R0 = (n − 1) αz has the same value
as in the single conical lens scheme. The point focus in F is transformed in a
ring focus of radius R0 = (n − 1) α (f − d), at location F’ ≃ F, where F is
the focus point of the convergent lens (the interval between both points is in
α2). If the gaussian properties of the incident beam are taken into consider-
ation, all these quantities becomes indeﬁnite, as the transverse expansion of
a gaussian beam is theoretically inﬁnite. However, for large incident beams
(i.e. wi >> λ, wi being the incident beam size at 1/e2 and λ the wavelength),
the geometrical approach remains a good approximation. Therefore, the above
expressions, where ri is replaced by wi, can be used, keeping in mind that they
concern 1/e2 intensity limits.

Fig. 2. Schematic behavior, in the geometrical approximation, of a collimated beam
through a converging lens L followed by a conical lens C. Point V is on the axicon
vertex, while point X corresponds to the abscissa z0 where a hole appears in the
center of the beam. The hatched zone between V and X is the Bessel zone.

This geometrical approach is unable to describe the thickness ρ of the ring.
To evaluate it, it is necessary to take into account the diﬀraction of the beam
during the propagation, and in particular on the conical lens vertex. Such a
theory shows that when the convergent conical lens doublet is illuminated by a
gaussian beam, the transverse distribution of the ring at the waist location, is
also gaussian, symmetrical with respect to the r = R0 circle [6]. Its thickness
at 1/e2 is ρ0 = 1.65w0, comparable to the beam waist w0 produced by the
converging lens without axicon. The ﬁeld amplitude of the wave after the lens
is given by the usual Fresnel approximation to the Kirchhoﬀ integral:

u(P ) = − i

2λ ZS

eikζ
ζ

ui (M) τ (M) I

dS

(1)

where λ is the wavelength and k = 2π/λ is the wave vector. u (P ) is the
complex amplitude of the ﬁeld in point P of the observation plane, ui (M) the
incident ﬁeld in point M of the diﬀraction plane and τ (M) the transmission
function of point M. The integration is done on the whole diﬀracting surface
S. ζ is the optical distance between M and P , and thus eikζ/ζ depicts the
spherical wave expanding out from point M. The inclination factor I depicts

4

the angle of the incident and diﬀracted beams with the normal to the surface
S. For small apertures and paraxial beams, it is approximated by I = −2, so
that Eq. 1 becomes:

u(P ) =

ui (M) τ (M)

dS

(2)

i
λ ZS

eikζ
ζ

The transmission function depends of course on the considered optical ele-
ments. It is τL (M) and τC (M) for respectively a lens and a conical lens:

τL (M) = exp

−ik

 

r2
2f !

τC (M) = exp (ik (n − 1) r tan α)

(3a)

(3b)

where r is the distance from point M to the optical axis, f is the focal length
of the lens and n the optical index. Eqs 3 do not take into account a ﬁxed
phase shift induced by the thickness of the lenses.

To compute the ﬁeld amplitude after the conical lens and compare it with
experimental measurements, we directly evaluate Eq. 2 through a standard
integration software, without any additional approximation. Experimentally,
we used a commercial conical lens from Bern optics, with α = 2◦ and a radius
of 5 mm. It is in BK7 glass with an optical index n = 1.51. The incident
gaussian beam, provided by a laser diode with λ = 852 nm, has a waist
wi = 645 µm, so that it can be considered as collimated, and we have z0 =
wi/β = 36 mm. The signal is detected through 2D and 1D CCD cameras, and
therefore we record the intensity of the pattern rather than its ﬁeld amplitude.
Thus the comparison between experimental and numerical results is performed
through the intensity transverse distribution.

Let us ﬁrst illustrate the limits of the present model with a spectacular ex-
ample: we consider the transverse distribution of the experimental beam de-
scribed above, at a distance z = 115 mm = 3.2 z0 after the conical lens. Fig. 3
shows the experimental (dashed line) and theoretical (full line) intensity dis-
tributions. While the ring diameters are identical, it is clear that the present
model is unable to reproduce the details of the distribution. In particular, the
experimental proﬁle shows a thin main ring, with inner contrasted secondary
rings, looking like diﬀracting rings. On the contrary, the model predicts a
unique thick ring, slightly modulated by diﬀraction. Thus it is clear that the
diﬀracting elements are not treated correctly in the model.

proﬁle of the beam in z = 115 mm = 3.2z0 after the axicon, obtained when the inci-
dent beam, with a waist wi = 645 µm, crosses a unique conical lens. The theoretical
proﬁle corresponds to the modelization of the axicon with a ponctual vertex. The
vertical scale corresponds to the theoretical curve, when the total light power is 100
mW. Units for the experimental curve are arbitrary.

4 Modelling of a real axicon

To enhance the model, we take into consideration the bluntness of the conical
lens vertex, by introducing an hyperbolic correction to the conical lens shape
(ﬁg. 4). We introduce the radius of curvature R of the hyperbole, so that the
thickness e (r) of the lens is:

e (r) = e0 − R tan2 (α)

1 +

(4)

where e0 is the thickness of the lens for R = 0, i.e. when the vertex is a
point. To evaluate the radius of curvature Rexp of our actual conical lens, we
use a ﬁt to adjust experimental and theoretical intensity distributions. The
best ﬁt, corresponding to Rexp = 3.5 mm, leads to a satisfying concordance
between experiments and theory (Fig. 5). The remaining diﬀerences between
both curves concern the amplitude of the secondary rings, but not their num-
ber neither their location. We have also applied our model to non collimated
beams, i.e. when the conical lens is used with a convergent lens. As shown
on Fig. 6, the transverse distribution of the beam after the doublet is well
reproduced. Therefore the hyperbolic approximation of the vertex appears to
be good enough to predict and optimize the use of an axicon to produce a
hollow beam.

Fundamental diﬀerences appear between the present conﬁguration and the
predictions of [6]. In particular, the beam size in the focal plane is almost 2.4

times larger than expected (Fig. 7a). If this broadening is eﬀectively linked to
the curvature of the conical lens vertex, we expect that it decreases when the
incident beam waist increases. Fig. 7b shows that indeed, if wi is increased
signiﬁcantly, the width of the ring becomes similar to that predicted in [6].

Fig. 8 shows how the ring thickness, measured at 1/e2 of its maximum inten-
sity, evolves as a function of z. Typically, three zones can be deﬁned, delimited
by the values z1 ≃ 45 mm ≃ 1.9 z0 and z2 ≃ 75 mm ≃ 3.1 z0. For z < z1, the
main peak of the distribution is in r = 0, as it is typical for the Bessel zone.
For z1 < z < z2, the thickness is almost constant, with ρ = 1.6w0 ≃ ρ0, where
w0 is the minimum waist of the single convergent lens, in the focus plane, and

Fig. 6. Experimental (dashed line) and theoretical (full line) transverse intensity
proﬁle of the beam in z = 65 mm = 2.7z0 after the axicon, obtained when the
incident beam, with a waist wi = 645 µm, crosses a convergent conical lens doublet.
The convergent lens has a focal length f = 100 mm, and is located at z = −10 mm.
The theoretical proﬁle corresponds to the modelization of the axicon with a rounded
vertex. Vertical scales as in Fig. 3.

ρ0 is the value predicted in [6]. In the third zone, referred as expanding zone
in the following, and corresponding to z > z2, ρ grows almost linearly with z.
This behavior is very diﬀerent from that expected. In particular, the narrowest
intensity distribution is not in the focus plane, but in the constant zone, just
after the Bessel area. However, the smaller ring thickness corresponds to that
predicted by [6] in the focus plane, although it occurs outside the focus plane.

But the main novelties of our model concern the shape of the transverse distri-
bution of the intensity. As shown in Fig. 9, very diﬀerent shapes are obtained
in the constant and expanding zone. In the constant zone, the external narrow
ring is accompanied by several secondary rings located inside the main one,
and separated by dark rings. In the immediate proximity of the Bessel zone,
the minimum of the dark rings is almost zero (Fig. 9a), and it increases as the
expanding zone is approach (Fig. 9b). At the edge of the constant and expand-
ing zones (Fig. 9c), the contrast between secondary and dark rings vanish, so
that in the expanding zone, the transverse distribution may be described by
one single asymmetric ring with a tail towards its center. The resulting pat-
tern in the expanding zone seems to be more clean, but it requires the use
of a mask to suppress the intensity at the center of the ring, leading to new
diﬀracting distortions of the pattern. On the contrary, in the constant zone,
and in particular in the proximity of the Bessel zone (in z1), a mask adjusted
to the ﬁrst dark ring cleans the pattern to the single external ring, without ad-
ditional distortion. The resulting pattern is a single narrow ring with two stiﬀ
sides. Thus the constant zone appears to be the most appropriate to produce
clean hollow beams.

Fig. 7. The full lines show the theoretical transverse intensity proﬁle of the beam
in the focal plane of the convergent conical lens doublet for an incident waist
wi = 645 µm in(a) and wi = 3 mm in (b). The dashed lines gives the gaussian
distributions with a width ρ0, predicted in [6]. Vertical scales as in Fig. 3.

Another important aspect in the experimental realization of hollow beams is
either the total light power inside the ﬁnal beam, or the peak intensity of the
ring. The ﬁrst point depicts the losses introduced by the mask, while the second
one is linked to the thickness of the ring. If the mask is placed at its optimal
location z1, as described above, it introduces losses of 22%, corresponding to
the part of power distributed in the secondary rings. This value have to be
compared to that obtained when the mask is placed in the focus plane, as
suggested in [6]. In this case, the losses depend naturally on the mask radius,
and thus of the ring thickness. To obtain a thickness comparable to that in z1,
we introduce 40% of losses. To reduce losses to 22%, it is necessary to increase
the thickness by a factor 2.3: it is clear that the use of a mask in z1 produces
narrower rings with less losses. As a consequence, as it can be easily realized
by comparing Fig. 7a and Fig. 9a, the peak intensity of the ring in almost
four times larger in z1 than in zw. So from the energetic point of view also,

dashed line is the value predicted in the focus plane in [6]. zw is the abscissa of the
focus plane.

the technique described above leads to a substantial gain.

In the whole preceding discussion, we have emphasized one given conﬁgura-
tion, with a lens with focal length f = 100 mm, with a distance d = 10 mm
between the lens and the axicon. The conclusions apply of course to other
values of f and d. As an example, we illustrate in Fig. 10 the hollow beam
obtained for a diﬀerent set of parameters, using the above technique. The re-
sulting pattern is a single ring with a stiﬀ inner border, and losses introduced
by the mask are measured to be 0.19±0.01, in good agreement with the theory.

5 Conclusion

We have shown that taking into account the curvature of the conical lens
vertex leads to an accurate description of the beam transformation through a
conical lens and a convergent conical lens doublet. Calculations are in excellent
agreement with the experiments. We show that the use of a mask allows to
obtain an excellent quality hollow beam, assuming that the mask is located
adequately, just after the Bessel zone. The quality of the hollow beam consists
in a single regular ring, with an intensity going abruptly to zero on its inner
side, and no residual intensity in the center of the ring. This enables the
use of such beams in interferometric experiments, as e.g. in the realization
of optical lattices[15]. In most of the applications, the present system will
win in convenience if a second conical lens, located just after the Bessel zone
of the ﬁrst one, is added to the convergent conical lens doublet. Indeed, the
second axicon will rectify the phase surfaces and ﬁx the ring radius versus
propagation. A third conical lens before the doublet may be added to control
independently R0 and ρ[16].

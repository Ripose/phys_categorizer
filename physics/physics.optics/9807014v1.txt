Abstract

We analyze the guiding problem in a realistic photonic crystal ﬁber us-

ing a novel full-vector modal technique, a biorthogonal modal method based

on the nonselfadjoint character of the electromagnetic propagation in a ﬁber.

Dispersion curves of guided modes for diﬀerent ﬁber structural parameters are

calculated along with the 2D transverse intensity distribution of the fundamen-

tal mode. Our results match those achieved in recent experiments, where the

feasibility of this type of ﬁber was shown.

Periodic dielectric structures (photonic crystals) have raised a growing interest

in the last years because they exhibit very interesting optical features. The most

relevant property of a photonic crystal is the possibility of generating photonic band

gaps for certain geometries [1]. This eﬀect has been observed in both 2D and 3D

structures in the form of absence of light propagation for a speciﬁc set of frequencies

(see Ref. [2] and references therein). A related phenomenon occurring in photonic

crystal structures is light localization at defects.

Although the previous phenomena were ﬁrst observed and analyzed in bulk struc-

tures, there exists a connected eﬀect of potential interest for light propagation in

dielectric crystals which have a 2D periodicity in the x-y plane broken by the pres-

ence of a defect, but are continuous in the z direction. The physical realization of such

a structure is what is called a photonic crystal ﬁber. This is a thin silica ﬁber having a

regular structure of holes that extend themselves along the whole ﬁber length. If one

of these holes is absent, the transverse dielectric periodicity gets broken and a defect

appears. The fact that light may be trapped at defects turns here into a propagation

feature. Consequently, the bound states of the 2D transverse problem (2D trapped

states of light) become the guided modes of the ﬁber propagation problem. The

experimental feasibility of these ﬁbers has been proven recently [3]. A preliminary

interpretation of their behavior involving the concept of eﬀective refractive index is

presented in Ref. [4]. A robust single-mode structure was observed for an unusually

wide range of wavelengths, a very remarkable property not present in ordinary ﬁbers.

Our interest lies in giving an appropriate treatment of the realistic problem of

a photonic crystal ﬁber by modeling and solving eﬃciently its transverse 2D struc-

2

ture. We next proceed to present an approach in which the full-vector character of

light propagation in ﬁbers is taken into account.

It is an adapted version of our

biorthonormal-basis modal method [5]. In this way, a realistic 2D periodic structure

with a central defect is properly implemented allowing us to analyze diﬀerent ﬁber

designs. As we will see, our results agree with those experimentally measured and,

at the same time, predict diﬀerent interesting behaviors for some particular designs.

Guided modes in an inhomogeneous ﬁber verify a set of dimensionally reduced

equations involving the transverse coordinates x and y exclusively [6]. This set of

equations is obtained from Maxwell’s equations by assuming the electromagnetic ﬁeld

to be monochromatic in time and to have a harmonic dependence on z (i.e., the ﬁeld

has a well-deﬁned propagation constant β). In terms of the transverse components of

the magnetic and electric ﬁeld, ht =

where ¯et =

where ǫρσ is the completely antisymmetric tensor in 2D, n the refractive index, and

k the free-space wave number. Of course, ∇2 is the Laplacian operator and ∇σ

the transverse components of the gradient operator. Let us notice that the general

problem of light propagation in a ﬁber, even for nonabsorbing materials (when n2 is

real), involves the nonhermitian operator L.

The most relevant property of Eq. (1) is that it constitutes a system of eigenvalue

equations for the L operator and its adjoint L† (something that it is far from obvious

when one starts from the reduced equations written in terms of ht and et —instead

of ¯et—, see, for instance, Ref. [6]). This feature is crucial in our approach to the

full-vector problem. Because ht and ¯et are the eigenfunctions of the L and L† oper-

ators, respectively, they are closely related. In fact, they verify what it is called the

biorthogonality relation, h¯en

t |hm

t i = δnm [7]. The biorthonormality property of the

{L, L†} eigenfunctions, {hm

t , ¯en

t }, guarantees the expansion of any squared integrable

function in terms of either the L or the L† eigenfunctions, in complete analogy with

the hermitian case. For the same reason, matrix elements can always be deﬁned in

terms of the “biorthogonal modes” of an arbitrary {L, L†} system.

The main goal of our approach is to transform the problem of solving the system

of diﬀerential equations (1) (including highly non trivial boundary conditions some-

times) into an algebraic problem involving the diagonalization of the L-matrix. The

spectrum of the L-matrix will be formed in general by 2D bound states and contin-

uum states. In terms of ﬁber propagation, the bound states of the L spectrum are

guided modes since, despite the ﬁnite width of the ﬁber, the ﬁelds exhibit a strong

decay in the transverse direction. On the contrary, states from the continuum radiate

radially and thus are not guided by the ﬁber.

The choice of an appropriate auxiliary basis is very important for an eﬃcient

implementation of our method.

In the particular case of a photonic crystal ﬁber

this election must be specially accurate. The main reason is that the complicated

4

spatial structure of the refractive index in a realistic case can transform the actual

computation of the L-matrix elements into an impossible task. Realistic simulations

must contemplate as many as nearly one hundred 2D step-index individual structures

(the air holes of the photonic crystal ﬁber). Therefore, a brute force computation of

the matrix elements becomes useless in practice due to critical loss of precision.

The implementation of the dielectric structure is carried out by putting the system

in a ﬁnite 2D box (of dimensions Dx and Dy) and requiring the ﬁelds to fulﬁll periodic

boundary conditions in the x and y directions. So, we create an artiﬁcial lattice by

replicating the original almost periodic structure, including the central defect, in

both transverse directions. This new superlattice is made of copies of the original cell

covering the whole two dimensional transverse plane. Although the original cell is

not periodic, the whole superlattice really is. The periodicity requirement implies we

can expand the 2D electromagnetic ﬁelds in a discrete Fourier series in terms of plane

waves determined by the exponential functions f~n(~xt) = exp(i~k~n · ~xt), where ~k~n =

2π( nx
Dx

, ny
Dy

) is the discretized transverse wave vector. This is equivalent to say we are

choosing the {f~n(~xt)} set as the auxiliary basis of our Hilbert space necessary to deﬁne

the matrix elements of the L-operator (note that the f~n functions are orthogonal).

A crucial property of the above plane-wave basis is that, due to periodicity of

the superlattice and despite it is deﬁned in a ﬁnite volume —the unit cell of the

superlattice of size Dx times Dy—, it is translationally invariant. The presence of

this symmetry shown by our auxiliary basis turns out critical for the feasibility of the

method. The advantage of the translation symmetry is twofold. On the one hand,

it allows us to relate easily any matrix element of the operator representing a hole

5

at an arbitrary position with that representing a hole at the origin of coordinates.

Since the whole matrix of the photonic crystal ﬁber structure can be written as a sum

over all matrices representing each one of the substructures (holes), and since these

substructures are identical (although diﬀerently located), it is possible to reduce the

problem to the calculation of one single matrix. On the other hand, the calculation

of any element of this single matrix can be worked out analytically in this basis (we

assume a circular step-index proﬁle for the hole). On top of that, and because of

the symmetry properties of a realistic hexagonally-centered conﬁguration of holes,

the sum over the set of points where the holes are located can also be analytically

solved. Consequently, the choice of periodic plane waves of the superlattice as a basis

to deﬁne the matrix elements of the realistic photonic ﬁber operator L leads to a

crucial simpliﬁcation. The problem of critical loss of precision due to the complex

spatial structure of the photonic crystal ﬁber is, in this way, overcome.

We have simulated a realistic photonic crystal ﬁber characterized by a hexagonal

distribution of air holes with a central defect. The hole radius a, the horizontal dis-

tance between the center of two consecutive holes —or pitch— Λ, and the wavelength

of light λ are free parameters that we have changed at will. The height of the refrac-

tive index step is also free, although we have kept it constant for comparison purposes.

We have simulated ﬁrst a realistic air-ﬁlled ﬁber with parameters a = 0.3 µm and

Λ = 2.3 µm. We have focussed on this particular design because the intensity distri-

bution for the guided mode in this structure has been measured experimentally for a

wavelength of λ = 632.8 nm. Experimental measures also show that the guided mode

in this ﬁber remains single in a remarkably wide wavelength range, extending from

6

337 nm to 1550 nm [3]. Our simulation allows us to evaluate the eigenvalues of the

L-operator at any wavelength and thus to calculate the modal dispersion curves for

the ﬁber under consideration in an even wider range of wavelengths (see Fig. 1). The

single-mode structure is formed by a polarization doublet. Our results completely

agree with the previous experimental results as they account for the existence of a

robust single-mode structure nearly at all wavelengths for the above ﬁber parameters.

We include in Fig. 1 the envelope of the radiation modes which is refered to as the

cladding index (i.e. the eﬀective refractive index of the photonic crystal).

Since the diagonalization procedure of the full-vector operator L generates not

only the set of eigenvalues but also their respective eigenvectors, we can also evaluate

the transverse intensity distribution of the electromagnetic ﬁeld for the guided mode.

The result for one of the polarizations is shown in Fig. 2 for λ = 632.8 nm and

reproduces, with excellent accuracy, that experimentally measured [3]. We have also

calculated the transverse intensity of the guided mode at very diﬀerent wavelengths

and for both polarizations. In all cases, the intensity proﬁle is very similar to that

shown in Fig. 2. In this way, we have checked the robust character of the single mode

structure under changes in the wavelenght of light. This fact agrees with the behavior

of the dispersion curves mentioned previously.

Besides simulating this remarkable structure, we have also simulated a number of

diﬀerent ﬁber designs by changing the pitch Λ and the hole radius a. By analyzing the

dispersion curves of these diﬀerently ﬁbers, we have found a richer modal structure

in some of them. In the example shown in Fig. 3 there exist, besides the fundamental

doublet, two other polarization doublets. Unlike conventional ﬁbers, the number

7

of modes does not increase with the light wave number k. The number of guided

modes gets stabilized above a k-threshold, or equivalently it remains constant for

wavelengths smaller than a threshold wavelength. For particular designs one can get

guiding structures in which this constant number is just one.

In such a case one

obtains and “endlessly” single-mode ﬁber as the one reported in Ref. [3]. This is a

very unconventional property shown by photonic crystal ﬁbers.

In a conventional ﬁber, the cladding refractive index is nearly constant and then

its V-value, the optical “volume” (or phase space) of the ﬁber, grows with k. This fact

permits to accommodate an increasing number of guided modes inside the ﬁber as the

wavelength is reduced. In a photonic crystal ﬁber the periodic structure responsible

for light trapping at the central defect creates a dependence on the eﬀective refractive

index of the cladding such that a much more weakly k-dependent V-value is generated.

The optical “volume” becomes then practically independent of the wavelength for

large values of k and, consequently, so do the number of guided modes.

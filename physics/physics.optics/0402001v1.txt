Abstract: When a plane wave is launched from a plane surface in a linear, homogenous,

dielectric–magnetic, uniaxial medium, we show that its phase velocity and the energy–transport

velocity vectors can be counterposed (i.e., lie on diﬀerent sides of the surface normal) under

Introduction

In any linear homogeneous medium, two distinct plane waves can propagate in any direction

(except in very rare circumstances [1, 2], which are ignored here). With each plane wave are

associated a phase velocity vector and an energy–transport velocity vector [3]. These two vectors

are parallel to each other in isotropic mediums, but not in anisotropic mediums.

While examining a recently reported experimental result [4], we came across the following

question: If a plane wave is launched from an inﬁnite plane — possibly, either by reﬂection

or refraction — into a linear, homogeneous, anisotropic medium, can the phase velocity and

the energy–transport velocity vectors be counterposed (i.e., lie on diﬀerent sides of the surface

normal), as shown in Figure 1? Although we suspected an aﬃrmative answer to the question,

we were unable to ﬁnd any treatment of the question in standard textbooks. Therefore, we

undertook an investigation, the results of which are reported here.

2 Analysis

Let us consider a dielectric–magnetic uniaxial medium whose relative permittivity and relative

permeability dyadics are denoted by

respectively, where I is the identity dyadic and uc is a unit vector parallel to the distinguished

axis of the medium.

In this medium, two distinct plane waves can propagate in any given direction, as detailed

elsewhere [5]. The wavenumbers of the two plane waves are obtained as

where uk is a unit vector denoting the direction of propagation while k0 is the free–space

wavenumber. The electric and magnetic ﬁeld phasors associated with the two plane waves are

known, their expressions not being needed for the present purposes.

But we do need expressions for the phase velocity and the energy–transport velocity vectors.

With the assumption that the imaginary parts of ǫa,b and µa,b are negligibly small, we obtain

for the energy–transport velocity vectors of the two plane waves, with c0 denoting the speed of

light in free space. Note that ve1,2 are co–parallel with the respective time–averaged Poynting

vectors; and they are also co–parallel with the respective group velocity vectors in the absence

of dispersion [3, Sec. 3.6].

Let us now suppose that a plane wave is launched into the half–space z > 0 from the plane

z = 0. We say that the phase velocity vector vpℓ and the energy–transport velocity vector veℓ of

the ℓ-th plane wave, (ℓ = 1, 2), are counterposed if the two vectors are pointed on the opposite

sides of the +z axis.

Without loss of generality, we set

uc = sin ξ ux + cos ξ uz

uk = sin θ ux + cos θ uz

,

where ux and uz are unit cartesian vectors, while the angles θ ∈ [−90◦, 90◦] and ξ ∈ [−90◦, 90◦].

and

emerge from (6).

Let us deﬁne angles ψℓ, (ℓ = 1, 2), through the relation veℓ = ve1,2(sin ψℓux + cos ψℓuz); hence,

tan ψℓ =

sin θ − δℓ sin(θ − 2ξ)
cos θ + δℓ cos(θ − 2ξ)

(sin θ) (tan ψℓ) < 0 .

Alternatively, the two velocity vectors of the ℓ-th plane wave are counterposed if ψℓ ≶ 0◦ when
θ ≷ 0◦.

Figure 2 shows computed values of ψℓ for θ > 0◦, when the degree of uniaxiality is positive

(i.e., ǫb > ǫa for ℓ = 1, and µb > µa for ℓ = 2). Figure 3 shows the computed values for

negative uniaxiality (i.e., ǫb < ǫa for ℓ = 1, and µb < µa for ℓ = 2). The latter ﬁgure can,

in fact, be deduced from Figure 2 via the substitution {δℓ → −δℓ, ξ → ξ ± π/2}, but has been

included for completeness. Quite clearly, a wide ξ–range exists for very small angles θ for

which the counterposition condition is satisﬁed. As θ increases, the ξ–range for counterposition

diminishes and eventually vanishes. The higher the degree of uniaxiality in magnitude, the

larger is the portion of the θξ space wherein the counterposition condition is satisﬁed.

When a plane wave is launched from a plane surface — possibly by refraction or reﬂection —

in a linear, homogenous, dielectric–magnetic, uniaxial medium, we have shown here that its

phase velocity and the energy–transport velocity vectors may be counterposed. An excellent

experimental example has been furnished by Zhang et al. [4].

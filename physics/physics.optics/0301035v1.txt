Stability of the self-phase-locked pump-enhanced singly resonant parametric oscillator

Jean-Jacques Zondy∗
BNM-SYRTE (UMR-CNRS 8630), 61 avenue de l’Observatoire, F-75014 Paris, France
(Dated: February 2, 2008)

Steady-state and dynamics of the self-phase-locked (3ω −→ 2ω, ω) subharmonic optical parametric
oscillator are analyzed in the pump-and-signal resonant conﬁgurations, using an approximate ana-
lytical model and a full propagation model. The upper branch solutions are found always stable,
regardless of the degree of pump enhancement. The domain of existence of stationary states is found
to critically depend on the phase-mismatch of the competing second-harmonic process.

A new class of subharmonic (frequency divide-by-three,
or 3
1) optical parametric oscillators (OPOs), namely
self-phase-locked (SPL-OPOs), has aroused lately much
interest from both the experimental [1, 2] and theo-
retical [3, 4, 5] standpoints. Consider a 3
1 OPO
pumped at an angular frequency ωp = 3ω (generating
signal and idler waves at ωs = 2ω and ωi = ω) con-
taining a second nonlinear crystal that is phase-matched
for the competing second-harmonic (degenerate down-
conversion) of the idler (signal) waves. The loss-free
χ(2) medium of total length L = L1 + L2 consists of a
dual-grating periodically-poled (PP) crystal comprising
a ﬁrst section of length L1 perfectly phase-matched for
the χ(2)
3ω; 2ω, ω) down-conversion, followed
by a second section of length L2 nearly phase-matched
for the competing χ(2)
2ω; ω, ω) process with
−
a wavevector mismatch ∆k = k2ω
= 0. Due to
the mutual self-injection of the subharmonic waves, the
dynamics of the signal-and-idler resonant devices was
recently shown to depart from that of a conventional
(L2 = 0) non-degenerate OPO [3]. The main diﬀer-
ence is that SPL-OPOs are characterized by an intensity
bistability (sub-critical bifurcation) whatever the conﬁg-
uration [3, 4, 5]. Secondly, each intensity state of the
stable branch can take 3 possible deterministic phase val-
ues equally spaced by 2π/3, while conventional OPOs are
subject to a stochastic phase diﬀusion process [6]. Exper-
1 SPL-OPOs are investigated in frequency
imentally, 3
metrology [1, 7, 8], Fourier synthesis of attosecond pulse
[2], transverse pattern formation [4, 5] and potentially for
new features in squeezed states of light. Finally, owing to
the much lower pump intensity requirement, SPL-OPOs
should be also suited for the ﬁrst experimental evidence
of a Hopf bifurcation in cw OPOs, predicted to only occur
in triply-resonant OPOs under extreme detuning condi-
tions [9].

In this brief report, I provide an analysis of the pump-
enhanced singly resonant device (SPL-PRSRO) which
was only over-viewed in the conclusion of Ref. [3]. Bear-
ing in mind that PRSROs are easier to implement than

DRO/TROs (subject to mode pair instabilities) or SROs
(requirement of high pump thresholds), it is interesting
to check how the dynamics of the doubly/triply reso-
nant SPL-OPOs is aﬀected when only one of the sub-
harmonic waves oscillates with a varying pump enhance-
ment, and to compare with the behaviour of the purely
idler-resonant (SPL-IRO) case treated by Longhi in the
mean-ﬁeld approximation and neglecting pump deple-
tion [5].

The analysis starts with the solutions of the reduced
propagation equations for the normalized slowly vary-
ing ﬁeld envelopes Aj(t′, Z) = g1L1Nj(t′, Z) (j = p, s, i)
throughout the dual-section medium. The complex am-

The dynamics of the systems can be numerically stud-
ied without any approximation by solving Eqs.(1-3) using
a fourth-order Runge-Kutta solver with the appropriate
initial conditions and making use of the boundary condi-
tions (4) (propagation model). Unstable ﬁxed point can-
not be found numerically so that approximate analytic
solutions of the steady state equations must be worked
out by expanding the amplitudes in Mac Laurin series

ﬁed by the smallness of the scaled amplitudes (

turbative approach, only the n = 1 terms in the ﬁeld
expansions need to be kept. After some algebra, the ap-

From the LSA of the trivial state, the threshold for os-
cillation (not necessarily on a stable ﬁxed point) remains
the same as for conventional devices. Fig.1 shows the
analytical bifurcation plot versus the pump parameter
for rp = 0.3 and 3 diﬀerent values for ¯∆s, as compared
with the solutions computed with the propagation model
(Fig.2). The bifurcation diagram versus ¯Iin displays a

the saddle-node point where ¯I +

ishingly small ¯∆s, one has ¯I0 < ¯Ith but as the detun-

the signal-and-idler resonant cases, for which a transition
from sub-criticality to super-criticality is predicted when

node point of coordinate ( ¯I0, ¯Is

threshold states in curve (1), resulting from the weak
self-injection regime. From the LSA of the Mc Laurin
solutions, the ¯I −
s branches (dashed curves) are always
unstable, due to a positive real eigenvalue, but only a
portion of the upper branch (solid lines) extending from
the saddle-node intensity ¯I0 to some critical intensity ¯IC
is found stable. The instability (dotted lines) beyond ¯IC
(characterized by 3 real positive eigenvalues of the LSA
equation) was conﬁrmed by the time mapping of the Mc

full propagation model converge to a ﬁxed point for any
input intensity value (Fig. 2). Hence the whole upper
branch of the SPL-PRSRO is actually stable, the insta-
bility predicted by the Mc Laurin model being merely an
artefact of the approximation. Actually, as the pump en-
hancement is decreased the validity range of the Mc Lau-
rin model is restricted to pump parameters lying closer
and closer to the threshold. In Fig. 2, obtained by back-
ward adiabatic following of the stationary solutions, all
curves end at their saddle-node point ¯I0 since critical
slowing down is observed as these points are approached.
The limit cycles occurring for ¯Iin < ¯I0 (hatched area)
are merely due to the non-existence of stationary states.
The upper branch is found stable even in the SRO limit
(rp = 0), whatever the detunings, in contrast with the
SPL-IRO mean-ﬁeld analysis results [5]. Let us remind
that in the SPL-DRO/TROs the upper branch was found
to destabilize via a Hopf bifurcation [3]. The diﬀerence in
dynamical behavior is due to the stronger self-injection
regime in these latter devices. The inset frame in Fig. 2
gives the output pump intensity (at z′ = 1) correspond-
ing to ¯∆p,s = 0 (curve (1)), it can be seen that the
pump is no longer clamped to unity as in conventional
PRSROs [10], meaning that the competing nonlinearity

the pump ﬁnesse increases (κp = 0.05), the Mc-Laurin
(thick solid lines) and the propagation model (thin solid
lines) converge excellently for any input intensity. Both
models predict then a whole upper branch stability, for
a wide range of input intensity (up to tested ¯Iin = 50
at least). The Mc Laurin model converges to the prop-
agation model because when κp
0 the assumption of
a linear z-dependence of the resonating ﬁelds inside the
medium is fully justiﬁed (uniform ﬁeld limit). Notice
that the threshold value is then more sensitive to the sig-
nal detuning than in Fig. 2. As a consequence of the
reduced sub-threshold state range due to the weak SPL
regime one expect that the self-locking detuning range,

paid back with a shrinking self-locking range. Fig.4 dis-
plays the critical ¯∆C (S) detuning for both rp = 0.3 and
rp = 0.95, when ¯∆p = 0 and when the device is pumped
4 times above threshold. Surprisingly, for the same non-
linear coupling strength S, the high pump resonance case
leads to less than a cavity linewidth SPL range, while for
the SRO limiting case the SPL range is 10-fold wider,
as with SPL-DRO/TROs. Hence a large SPL range
is not necessarily associated with the double-resonance
condition that involves a strong mutual-injection process
between the subharmonics. The small (< 1-MHz, e.g.
less than a cavity linewidth) self-locking range reported
by Boller et al
[1] for a SPL-PRSRO is in agreement
with this expectation. As a noticeable diﬀerence with
the signal-and-idler resonant cases, the coeﬃcients of the
LSA equation depend on the phase of the coupling pa-
rameter χ, while χ enters only as its modulus in the SPL-
DRO stability analysis (see the Appendix in Ref.[3]).
One hence expects that the dynamics of SPL-PRSROs
will be sensitive to the SHG phase mismatch ξ. Fig.5
shows the steady-state signal intensity contour plots in
the parameter space ( ¯Iin, ξ), computed with the propa-
gation model for ¯Iin = 4, rp = 0.95, ¯∆p = 0 and two
values S = 0.2 (a,c) and S = 0.75 (b,d) of the coupling
parameter. For the stronger coupling S = 0.75 (panels
π,
b-d), small amplitude limit cycles arise around ξ =
even for ¯δs = 0 (panel b). To avoid such non-stationary
states, it is important to tailor accurately the simultane-
ous phase-matching of both competing processes.

±

In conclusion, it is found that the whole upper branch
of the SPL-(PR)SRO is stable and that the self-locking
range shrinks with increasing pump enhancement. In the
SRO limit, the approximated model may fail to describe
correctly the dynamical behavior over a large pump input
range. Of more concern, in contrast with signal-and-idler
resonant devices, the domain of existence of stationary
phase-locked states is found sensitive to the value of the

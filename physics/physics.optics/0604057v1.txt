Abstract

We extend the theory of Talbot revivals for planar or rectangular geometry to the
case of cylindrical waveguides. We derive a list of conditions that are necessary
to obtain revivals in cylindrical waveguides. A phase space approach based on the
Wigner and the Kirkwood-Rihaczek functions provides a pictorial representation of
TM modes interference associated with the Talbot eﬀect.

Key words: Talbot eﬀect, self-imaging, waveguides, interference
PACS: 42.30Va, 42.25.Hz

1 Introduction

Although the Talbot eﬀect was discovered ﬁrstly in the beginning of nineteen
century (1836) and then rediscovered many times in diﬀerent systems, it has
never been a widely known phenomenon. In quantum systems it is often re-
ferred as “self-imaging” or “quantum revivals”. Even in the optical domain
not always Talbot name is mentioned when this phenomenon is described
and discussed. However, it was W. H. F. Talbot, who ﬁrstly observed that
monochromatic light passing through periodic grating at a certain distance
from the grating forms its ideal image and consecutively at integer multiples
of this distance similar images are reproduced. He also demonstrated that
when white light is used, images of the grating of diﬀerent colors are formed
at diﬀerent distances and that is why we believe that all “self-imaging” eﬀects
should be referred as Talbot eﬀects.

After the original paper by Talbot [1], followed by the work of Lord Rayleigh
[2], and then by a series of papers of Wolfke [3], many papers have been writ-

ten about this subject. A comprehensive description of the Talbot eﬀect and
its rediscoveries in classical optics can be found in Patorski [4]. Similar his-
torical review and a detailed description of “quantum revivals” can be found
in [5]. In the last years of the XX century fractional aspects of the Talbot
eﬀect attracted considerable interest [6,7,8,9]. These eﬀects were studied both
in optical and quantum mechanical domains. As regards Talbot eﬀect in op-
tical waveguides most signiﬁcant are works of Ulrich [11], who investigated
waveguides of planar and ribbon geometries.

The literature concerning the Talbot eﬀect in planar or rectangular waveguide
geometries is quite reach (even some US patents for applications of the Talbot
eﬀect in those systems exist), but the much more practical cylindrical geom-
etry was not taken into account in optical studies. We present in this paper a
comprehensive theoretical study of the Talbot eﬀect in cylindrical waveguides.
This should ﬁll the gap in the available descriptions of self-imagining phenom-
ena in various waveguides. There is a limited number of papers mentioning
cylindrical geometry in quantum revivals [12], but the results presented in this
paper go beyond the one obtained so far.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present general assumptions
from which our study starts. We use a formal similarity between ﬁeld prop-
agation in waveguides and the dynamics of wave packets in potential wells
in a given geometry. Using this analogy phase space Wigner and Kirkwood-
Rihaczek functions are used. The phase space functions provide a pictorial
description of interference eﬀects, that are the basis of the Talbot revivals. In
Section 3, the case of dielectric ﬁbers and the possibility of revivals in this most
practical for possible application system is studied. In Section 4, solutions of
the wave equation in cylindrical mirror waveguides are analyzed and require-
ments that have to be fulﬁlled to obtain revivals are derived and imposed.
A detailed study of approximations used is included. Finally, a summary of
the results is given with a short paragraph devoted to the presentation of the
applied method.

2 Talbot eﬀect in phase space

2.1 General assumptions

The reason why the Talbot eﬀect appears both in optical and quantum me-
chanical systems, mathematically can be summarized very brieﬂy: The Helmholtz
equation is common for classical electrodynamics and quantum mechanics.
The dependence of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the direction of ﬁeld propaga-
tion can be regarded as an analogue of time dependence of a wave packet in

2

quantum mechanics. In the regime where paraxial approximation is justiﬁed
this analogy is especially clear.

This paper is focused on Talbot revivals of an initial ﬁeld in cylindrical waveg-
uides which is purely an optical phenomenon but, nevertheless, as we shall see
in the next paragraphs, its most simple explanation can be given referring to
quantum mechanical concept of phase space distributions. The key question
we shall pose and answer is whether the Talbot eﬀect in cylindrical waveguides
exists and can be used in practice.

We assume that harmonic, monochromatic plane waves propagate through the
waveguide which symmetry axis was chosen as the z direction of the system.
Inserting the ﬁelds

E(x, y, z, t) = E(x, y)e±ikz−iωt,

B(x, y, z, t) = B(x, y)e±ikz−iωt ,

(1)

into the Maxwell equations, we obtain the two-dimensional Helmholtz equa-

The propagating constants ki corresponding to speciﬁc modes are to be derived

2.2 Phase space distributions

As we have already mentioned the basis of Talbot eﬀect, i.e. interference, is
especially clearly seen in the phase space description. The quasi–distribution
functions used for the study of electromagnetic ﬁelds, especially pulses, usu-
ally work in the time–frequency domain. Here, a totally diﬀerent approach was
chosen as all the ﬁelds taken into consideration are assumed to be monochro-
matic and of a harmonic time–dependence. Thus, we shall use a typical phase
space known from mechanics constructed from the position and momentum
variables.

Some complications result from the fact that the electromagnetic ﬁeld requires
a vector description. However, in many cases (e.g. mirror waveguides) solutions
of the Maxwell equations are divided into T M and T E modes, i.e. are of
type entirely determined by the Ez or Bz ﬁeld component, respectively. Thus,
we can treat Ez (Bz) component, that fully describes the ﬁeld, as a single

3

scalar function corresponding to the quantum mechanical wave function of a
potential well problem with analogous geometry.

To present problems of revivals is phase space we shall use the following two
quasi-distribution functions: the Wigner function [14,15],

WΨ(~x, ~p) =

Ψ⋆(~x + ~ξ/2) ei~p~ξ Ψ(~x

~ξ/2) ddξ ,

which is the most commonly known phase space distribution, and the Kirkwood-
Rihaczek (K-R) function [16,17]:

K(~x, ~p) =

ddξ Ψ⋆(~ξ) ei(~ξ−~x)~p Ψ(~x).

(3)

that is very convenient for calculations. Subscript d in the deﬁnitions above de-
notes number of spatial dimensions of the system, whereas Ψ is a function that
characterizes a system (e.g. wave function in quantum mechanical applications,
or Ez ﬁeld component for TM modes in waveguides, etc.) Because for 3 dimen-
sional systems phase space distributions are 6 dimensional, graphically only se-
lected cross-sections can be presented. This arbitrary choice is made somehow
easier for solutions of the form of Eq. (1), when the z-dependence of the ﬁeld
separates from the transversal components. Figure 1 shows examples of the
“transversal” Wigner and K–R functions calculated for Ez = J0(j1r)
J0(j2r),
which corresponds to superposition of TM01 and TM02 modes in cylindrical
mirror waveguide: j1, j2 denote the ﬁrst and the second zero of Bessel function
J0(u) and r =
, where a is a waveguide radius.

As we have already mentioned in the case of solutions of Maxwell equations
having the plane wave form we consider here, the z-dependence of the ﬁeld sep-
arates from the transversal components. Thus, when describing Talbot eﬀect,

4

we can simply “forget” the transversal dependence of the ﬁeld and concentrate
on the z–pz cross-section of the phase space distribution which is essential for
the Talbot revivals. Integrals corresponding to the exp(
ikiz) factors are quite
elementary and the cross-sections of quasi-distribution functions for given x,
y, px, py, i.e. set the transversal position and momentum components, are easy
to obtain.

possible (ki

ing constants ki vividly depend on the type of waveguide and its parameters,
such a commensurability is rather an exceptional then a typical case. Even
dealing with highly symmetric problems like mirror waveguides of planar or
γ2
square cross-sections we have to keep in mind that ki =

from propagating modes. A deﬁnite advantage of working within the range
where the linear approximation of square root holds for systems having γi’s
proportional to each other is the fact that for a given wavelength the Tal-
bot distance is settled, it does not depend on superposed modes. Otherwise,
diﬀerent modes superpositions shall revive at diﬀerent distances.

The phase space description brings us in a natural way to this simple idea and
indicates how fundamental this concept is.

3 Talbot eﬀect in dielectric waveguides

Cylindrical dielectric waveguides are called optical ﬁbers. We shall analyze
only the step–index ﬁbers, i.e. the ﬁbers with constant refractive indexes in
the core and the cladding, which are entirely characterized by radii of core and
cladding and their reﬂective indexes n1 = √µ1ε1 and n2 = √µ2ε2. Assuming
that the cladding and the core diﬀer only by dielectric constants (magnetic
permeabilities µ1 = µ2) the standard boundary conditions lead to the following
equation [18,19]

way to solve it analytically. In the simplest case when the ﬁeld has no azimuthal
dependence, i.e. ν = 0, its solutions can be divided into T E and T M type, as
for the mirror waveguides. Then a graphical picture gives a clear representation
of solutions similarly to the case of ﬁnite potential wells in quantum mechanics.
However, we have to keep in mind that the ϕ
independence, corresponding to
ν = 0, is not a typical case. General solutions of Eq. (8) are ϕ dependent and,
actually, the lowest propagating mode in step-index dielectric ﬁber is obtained
for ν = 1. Thus, let us start our analysis from general solutions.

3.1 General solutions in step index ﬁbers

The lowest propagating mode in a cylindrical dielectric waveguide is always an
HE11 mode (in this notation HE means that ﬁeld Hz dominates over Ez ﬁeld,
while for EH modes the Ez ﬁeld dominates). Single mode ﬁbers are of a great
practical importance, but in this study we are not interested in them because a
single mode propagates without a change in its transverse distribution. Next
modes are T E01, T M01, and HE21. They appear almost simultaneously as
their propagating constants are nearly the same.

Let us ﬁrstly consider a ﬁber in which there are only these four propagating
modes (e.g. λ = 1550nm, n1 = 1.46, n2 = 1.45, a = 4.5µm). We shall refer to
this situation as to the “limit of small number of modes”. Numerical solutions
of Eq. (8) obtained for these parameters are: aγHE11 = 1.79268, aγT E01 =
2.75973, aγT M01 = 2.76234, aγHE21 = 2.76342. While analyzing problem of
revivals of superpositions of HE11, T E01, T M01, and HE21 modes, one has
to realize that although four modes are superposed, it is a special case when
three propagating constants (corresponding to T E01, T M01, and HE21 modes)
are really close to each other. As we have already mentioned, superpositions
of arbitrary two modes with propagating constants k1, k2 shall revive at all
integer multiples of zT = 2π
k1−k2 . It is easy to calculate that initial images
constructed from superposition of pairs (HE11, T yE01), or (HE11, T M01) or
(HE11, HE21) shall revive at multiples of zt
2 = 3.3967mm,
zt
3 = 3.39214mm, respectively. Those values are so close to each other that
images constructed from all four modes shall revive at a mean value which
is ¯zT = 3.39891mm. In numerical simulations of ﬁeld propagation one can
observe the ﬁrst, second and even 20th or 50th Talbot revival. Obviously,
higher revivals are less accurate, and after several tenths of faithful revivals
they get out of phase – but then, after some propagating distance they get in
phase again, and again some faithful revivals are obtained. Then the situations
of getting in and out of phase appropriate cosines repeats almost cyclicly.

It is seen that in the limit of small number of modes Talbot revivals in dielectric
ﬁbers can be obtained. Change of ﬁbers parameters will result in the change of
Talbot distance, but it is quite obvious that for a small number of propagating
modes Talbot revivals can be obtained. Just as we have seen using phase space
representation – appropriate number of cosines have to get in phase to obtain
the revivals.

This simple and quite intuitive method of looking for the Talbot distance starts
to be more complicated when the number of propagating modes increases.
Then, diﬀerent methods are have to be applied to calculate revival distance
as we shall see in the next section on the example of T E0i modes.

3.2 The ϕ–independent case (ν = 0)

The ϕ–independent solutions of Eq. (8) can be divided into T E and T M
modes. For T E modes the following relation is obtained:

Because the parameters Γ and κ are (by deﬁnition) correlated,

Γ2 + κ2 =

c2 (n2
we obtain a set of equations that can be solved graphically or numerically.
It is convenient to introduce a normalized frequency parameter V, Eq. (11),
K1(κ)
K0(κ) as a function of Γ for appropriate
and depict for example
values of V.

Graphical solutions of Eq. (12) are similar to those of Eq. (10), the only
diﬀerence is that the Macdonald part of the plot K1(κ)
κK0(κ) is modiﬁed by a ﬁxed
factor ε1
ε2 , which is usually close to 1. In practice this means that T E0n and
T M0n modes have nearly the same propagation constants and they will tend
to appear simultaneously.

→ ∞

In the previous subsection we were dealing with the small number of modes,
so now let us focus on a limit of large number of propagating modes (large
frequency parameter V). In the limit V
, solutions aγn would be given
by zeros of the Bessel J1(ρ) function, and propagating constants would cor-
respond exactly to those obtained for T E0n modes in the mirror waveguides.
This case would be widely discussed in the next Section, thus, now we shall
take into consideration only the ﬁnite values of V. Analyzing the graphical
representation of Eq. (10) for diﬀerent values of frequency parameter V one
ﬁnds that with the increase V the Macdonald part of the plot, K1(κ)
κK0(κ), starts
to be parallel to Γ axis for the increasing range of Γn’s. Moreover, it is also
1
getting closer to this axis as for Γ
V . For large V
→
and low mode numbers solutions would be of very regular form: the ﬁrst one
corresponding to T E01 mode will be given by, say Γ0, and the approximate
formula for the next solutions would be Γn = Γ0 + anπ. Obviously the larger
V, the more accurate this formula is, and it works well only for modes having
numbers low in comparison to the total number of modes. Thus, in order to
obtain revivals we shall use only a few percent of the lowest from propagating
modes for constructing initial images, namely those modes for which the linear
approximation of the square root is suﬃcient. Sometimes, however, it is easier
to omit such analytical approximations and to simply calculate numerically
inﬁdelities of intensity distribution as a function of z and look for the minima
of this function.

3.2.1 Examples of revivals

In this Section we consider only the ϕ
independent ﬁelds that are fully charac-
terized by their cross-section along the radius. Thus, the ﬁgures presented shall
show cross-sections of the light intensity versus the normalized distance from
a ﬁber center ρ/a. All the examples were calculated numerically for a quite
thick ﬁber (a = 1mm) with refractive indexes of the core and cladding equal to
n1 = 1.47, n2 = 1.45, respectively and a wavelength of λ = 850nm. For these
values of λ, n1, and n2 the frequency parameter equals V= 1786.35, which
correspond to more then 550 propagating T E modes, and γ0 = 3.82956/a.

a) symmetric superposition of T E01 + T E02 + T E03 + T E04 modes
Figure 3 presents the light intensity corresponding to the superposition T E01+
T E02 +T E03 +T E04 at z = 0, z = zt = 27.7036m, z = 10zt, z = 30zt, z = 60zt,
and z = 100zt. The original intensity is depicted in black, the revivals in blue.
Above the plots of revivals their inﬁdelities are depicted. The value of the
Talbot distance zt was determined numerically by ﬁnding minimum of the
inﬁdelity function, Eq. (9). It is seen that although revivals are not perfect they
are certainly faithful enough even at distances of 1km. For comparison, Figure
4 presents examples of the light intensities at distances between revivals: it is
clear that the intensities at multiples of the Talbot distance diﬀer signiﬁcantly
from typical intensity distribution during propagation.

ﬁdelities of revivals depend signiﬁcantly on the eﬀective number of terms of
the Bessel-Fourier (BF) series contributing to the initial image. Although in
the example presented above we have taken ﬁrst 25 terms of the BF series,
only ﬁrst 9 coeﬃcients were larger then 1/1000 and only ﬁrst 4 were larger
then 1/100. The coeﬃcients from 11th to 25 were of the order of 5/10000.
If we would like to propagate, say, a more slim Gaussian these proportions
would be diﬀerent. Is is worth noting that in the case of dielectric waveguides
this eﬀective number of contributing modes eﬀect not only the ﬁdelities of
revivals, but also the optimal Talbot distance, which we will clearly see in the
comparison with the next example.

+ T E025 modes

c) symmetric superposition of T E01 + T E02 +
This example of revivals in a thick ﬁber illustrates how the eﬀective number
of contributing modes might modify a Talbot distance. As the initial intensity
we take the one corresponding to the symmetric superposition of T E01 +
+ T E025 modes. Figure 6 presents the initial intensity, its 1st Talbot

revival and then 10th, 30th, 60th, and 100th Talbot revival. The numerically
calculated “optimal” Talbot distance is equal in this case zt = 27.7013m,
which is slightly smaller then in the case presented in examples a), b).

Bessel functions is
ﬁrst few modes contribute to the initial image (or their contribution domi-
nates) the real Talbot distance would be slightly diﬀerent then if there were
more contributing modes. Diﬀerences in optimal Talbot distance zt for su-
perpositions presented in examples a), b), c) can be evaluated explicitly by
calculating the inﬁdelities of revivals. They start to be important at 20th, or
50th revival when the initial 2mm diﬀerence in optimal Talbot distances re-
sults in 5 or 10cm divergence from the distance of optimal revival. As long as
we are interested only at the ﬁrst Talbot revival we can take an average ¯zt and
the inﬁdelities of revivals of diﬀerent initial images at ¯zt should not be larger
then 1/100 which is suﬃcient for most applications. Obviously, when we are
interested in revivals at larger distances all the initial images can be divided
in classes having the same “eﬀective number of contributing modes” and the
revivals at multiples of the corresponding “optimal Talbot distances” would
be obtained for all the images within the class.

We have shown numerical simulations indicating that the Talbot revivals of
initial images constructed from T E0n modes can be obtained in optical ﬁbers.
Although examples a) - c) present superposition of T E modes, one can note
that for T M0n modes revivals should be even more faithful, as ε1
ε2 < 1 and thus
γn are even closer to zeros of J1(ρ) function then it is for TE modes, which
brings us to the case of mirror waveguides.

4 Talbot eﬀect in mirror waveguides

Although we present it in the last Section, a model of ideal mirror waveguides
is very useful for preliminary calculations. It is analytically soluble for systems
of standard geometries because boundary conditions are quite simple: normal
component of B and tangential component of E have to vanish at the boundary
mirror surface.

4.1 Planar mirror waveguides

In the elementary case of planar mirror waveguide the propagation constant
n2π2
for nth mode is given by k2
d2 , where d denotes a separation distance
between mirrors plates [20,18]. It is clear that, in general, the ﬁeld changes
its transverse distribution as it travels through the waveguide because dif-
ferent modes travel with diﬀerent propagation constants and diﬀerent group
velocities. The following expansion of the propagation constant kn,

shows, however, that within this approximation for z = 4k0d2
the initial ﬁeld
is obtained. Obviously, requirements for above linear approximation are not
met for an arbitrary kn. Higher modes have to be prevented from contributing
to the image, because only then approximation of the square with accuracy
to the linear term is suﬃcient. The reason why revivals appear is that γi
factors are all of the form constant (characterizing the system) times integer.
The question arises whether in cylindrical mirror waveguides similar analytical
formula for the Talbot distance can be obtained.

π

Let us note here that necessity of taking care of paraxial approximation is the
main diﬀerence between optical and quantum mechanical Talbot revivals. In
the case of inﬁnite potential well in quantum mechanics, eigenvalues of the
system are given by n2π2
and no excluding of modes (wave functions) that
d2
follows from linearization of square root is needed.

ing to compare plots and inﬁdelities obtained for the same ﬁeld distribution,
but for diﬀerent values of ak, as it is clearly seen that inﬁdelities are much
lower for smaller λ to a ratio. This eﬀect is connected with the quality of linear
approximation of the square root from Eq. (14). The smaller percentage of all
modes is used to construct the initial picture the lower inﬁdelities of higher
revivals are to be expected.

4.2.2 Some comments on approximations used

Revivals presented in previous paragraph are quite faithful which means that
approximations used to predict the existence of revivals were justiﬁed. How-
ever, please note, that the examples studied in the previous subsection had the
following property: superposed modes were of the same angular dependence
(they have corresponded to the Bessel functions of ﬁxed number ν). Studying
more complicated combinations one ﬁnds out that superpositions of modes
with diﬀerent azimuthal mode numbers do not revive at the Talbot distance
[21].

Numerical simulations of ﬁeld propagation show that the situation is really
interesting. As we have already mentioned, superposition of TM or TE modes
having the same angular dependance revive quite faithfully at Talbot distance
and only for the superpositions of “mismatched” modes revivals are not ob-
tained. Explanation of this surprising fact is the following: the higher terms of
the asymptotic formulae for the roots of Bessel functions, and its derivatives

are more important then we have assumed so far. In many papers and text-
books only ﬁrst terms (A, A′) of above approximations are used and we have
also limited ourselves to them in preliminary calculations but to obtain a
faithful approximation at least two ﬁrst terms should be taken into account.
From formulas (15), (16) it is, however, clear that when higher terms are taken
into account, ﬁnding the Talbot distance for arbitrary ν and n fails, because
diﬀerent powers of π would be included.

16

So how we can observe any revivals at all? Let us take a closer look at approx-
imation (16), i.e. one considering TE modes – keeping in mind that similar
analysis can be made for TM modes as well. Taking two ﬁrst terms of approx-
imation (16) the following expression for j′2

Obviously, this is the eﬀect we were looking for as term 2A′B′ = ν2 + 3
4
depends only on the azimuthal mode number ν and not on the radial one n.
That is the reason why modes having the same angular dependence revive
at the Talbot distance zT = 16
λ , while for a superposition of modes with
diﬀerent angular dependence we do not obtain such revivals. In the ﬁrst case
i(4ν2 + 3)zT /4) is merely a phase common for all the terms of
factor exp (

the superposition. When the initial Hz is the superposition of a form Hz(0) =
Jν(j′
νnρ)eiνϕ + Jµ(j′
µmρ)eiµϕ then at z = zT phase factors corresponding to Jν
and Jµ diﬀer for ν
= µ and, consequently, they do not cancel. This relative
phase destroys the Talbot revivals promised by less accurate approximation.

17

6
Similar analysis shows that superpositions of T M and T E modes will not re-
vive at the same distance because of the relative phase. Only for T M1i and
T E0j modes this relative phase disappears and Talbot eﬀect can be observed.
However, due to possibility of using polarizers, restrictions imposed by neces-
sity of choosing polarization of modes used is experimentally less demanding
then that concerning ϕ-dependance.

We have discussed in details approximations that appear in the study of the
Talbot eﬀect in the cylindrical mirror waveguides as well as diﬀerent approxi-
mations used in the case of dielectric waveguides. We have shown that in many
cases almost perfect revivals can be obtained and that even dephased propaga-
tion can be used in practice. We have stressed that a phase space description
(sometimes regarded as an unnecessary complicated representation) extracts
an essence of the interference phenomena and that the conditions needed to
be fulﬁlled to obtain Talbot revivals in a very natural way follow from a phase
space description of interference.

5 Summary

6 Methods

The following numerical procedure was used for decomposing given initial light
intensity Iorg into T M0i modes: For an arbitrary spherically symmetric T M ﬁeld
with an initial Ez of a form

we have evaluated the light intensity I(0) and this I(0) was expanded again in a
Bessel-Fourier series corresponding to J0. Numerical evaluation of some integrals
was required at this point. In such a way general “basis” (e1, e2, ..., e50) was ob-
tained, (every ei being a sum of all possible pairs xi
xj with numerically calculated
coeﬃcients). Then, an arbitrary ϕ-independent intensity Iorg that we would like to
propagate through the waveguide was decomposed in BF series

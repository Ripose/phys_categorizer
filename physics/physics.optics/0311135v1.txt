Abstract

The Goos-H¨anchen (G-H) eﬀect for neutron reﬂection from condensed matter is
considered. An experiment to quantify the eﬀect is proposed. The relation of G-H
shift to the neutron coherence length is considered.

Key words: Neutron optics, Goos-H¨anchen eﬀect, quantum mechanics, wave
packets.

1 Introduction

Newton suggested ﬁrst (see, for example [1,2]),
that a beam of light at a specular reﬂection shifts
some distance along the surface of a reﬂecting
mirror, as shown in ﬁg. 1. If the incident light is
represented by a ray, then propagation of the ray
in a mirror can be described by some trajectory,
where exit point B of the reﬂected ray does not
coincide with entrance point A of the incident
one. The shift AB is called G-H eﬀect, because F.
Goos and H. H¨anchen [2,3] experimentally mea-
sured it.

The shift should exist not only for light but also
for particles, because propagation of particles in
quantum mechanics is described by wave func-
tions similar to the wave ﬁeld of the light.

The shift depends on interaction of particles with
matter and investigation of it can be useful for
applied [1,4] and fundamental research. In this
article we consider G-H eﬀect in neutron physics
(see, for example, [5] and references there in).

We address several problems. First, we calculate
longitudinal G-H shift at total reﬂection for re-
stricted Gaussian beams (like in optics) and for
wave packets. We believe that this approach is
more general than the one (with the help of two
plane waves) used in [5]. Second, we calculate de-
viation of reﬂected beam from specular direction
for Gaussian beam (it is similar to [6] in x-ray op-
tics) and for wave-packets. And third, we discuss
the problem of enhanced G-H eﬀect at reﬂection
from a thin layer evaporated on a totally reﬂect-
ing substrate. We believe that investigation of
G-H eﬀect in optics of neutrons can help to un-
derstand deeper the nature of the neutron wave
function: whether it is a plane wave or a wave
packet. If it is the wave packet then whether it is
related to preparation of the neutron beam or it
is an intrinsic property of the neutron.

Section 2 reminds the reader how the G-H ef-
fect is calculated. We consider plane waves, ﬁnite
beams and wave packets reﬂection from a single
interface and from a layer on a substrate. In sec-
tion 3 we discuss how peculiarities related to the
G-H eﬀect can be measured, and what informa-
tion on neutron wave packet can be obtained. We

types of this function: plane wave, stationary
beam, and a wave packet.

address there a question whether calculation of
reﬂection amplitude from a layer with two inter-
faces, which uses coherent superposition of co-
herent multiple reﬂection of waves (see, for ex-
ample [7,8,9,10]), is accurate, and justify the ap-
propriateness of introduction in [11] of so called
“coherence length”. This length determines such
a length of the G-H shift, at which reﬂection co-
eﬃcient contains a considerable contribution of
incoherent reﬂection.

At the end of this paper, in conclusion, we shortly
discuss applicability of our calculation of the neu-
tron G-H eﬀect to x-rays

Here we consider neutron reﬂection from an ideal
surface of a semiinﬁnite mirror, which means that
we have a single interface. Reﬂection takes place
because interaction of neutron with matter. This
interaction is characterized by an optical poten-
tial u/2, where u = 4πN0b, N0 is atomic den-
sity, b is coherent scattering amplitude on a sin-
gle atom, and for convenience we set ¯h = m = 1.
If normal component kz of the incident neutron
momentum k is small (k2
z < u), the neutron is
totally reﬂected from the interface, i.e. reﬂection
2 = 1. If normal component kz is
coeﬃcient
large (k2
z > u), the reﬂection is not total (in the
2 < 1.
following we call it “nontotal”) , and
Here R denote reﬂection amplitude.

shift φ = 0, the phase of the reﬂected wave at
every points on the interface is equal to the phase
of the incident wave.

ωt of the incident wave at points
rk displaced along the interface by a distance
δrk = 2φ/kk. This distance can be called the
G-H shift, but a spatial displacement can be
well deﬁned only for ﬁnite size beams. In case of
inﬁnite plane waves we can talk only about the
phase shift.

2.2 Two plane waves

In [5] the G-H shift was calculated with the help
of two plane waves. The incident neutron was
supposed to be described by the wave function

ψi = exp(ik1r) + exp(ik2r)

, consisting of two waves with wave vectors ki =
(kix, ki⊥), where kx is a component along surface,
and k⊥ is perpendicular to it. This function can
be also represented as

ψi = 2 exp(ikr) cos(δkr),

(2)

where k = (k2 + k1)/2, δk = (k1
k2)/2. We
see, that at the interface z = 0 we have a plane
wave exp(ikxx) modulated by cos(δkxx).

−

After total reﬂection this wave function is trans-
formed into

ψr = R(k1⊥) exp(ikr

1r) + R(k2⊥) exp(ikr

2r) =

2r + iφ2),

= exp(ikr

1r + iφ1) + exp(ikr
where for total reﬂection we replaced reﬂection
amplitudes R(ki⊥), which depend only on nor-
mal komponents of the wave vectors by exp(iφi).
Wave vectors of the reﬂected waves are kr
i =
(kix,
ki⊥). The sum of the reﬂected waves can
be also represented as

−

ψr = 2 exp(ikrr + iφ) cos(δkrr + δφ),

2 + kr
2)/2, and δφ = (φ1

where kr = (kr
1)/2, φ = (φ1 + φ2)/2, δk =
kr
(kr
φ2)/2. We see, that
at the interface z = 0 we have a plane wave
exp(ikxx+φ) modulated by cos(δkxx+δφ). If we
represent δφ as δkxξ (why not?) we obtain that
modulation of the reﬂected wave is shifted along
x axis by ξ = δφ/δkx, which can be considered
and was accepted in [5] as the G-H shift.

2.3 Wave function of a beam

a cylindrically symmetrical Gaussian [6]. Such a
wave function can be stationary, and it creates an
elliptical spot at the interface [6]. We will place
an origin r = 0 of the coordinate system in the
center of this spot and choose xz to be the plane
of incidence. The beam at the interface is

Once we ﬁnd the the wave function of the re-

To ﬁnd the reﬂected wave function we need ﬁrst
to restore the complete incident one from its spot

around maximum point q = kk = (kx, 0) of the

One can see that there is no G-H shift, since the
reﬂected beam is centered at the same point as
the incident beam. However the reﬂection am-
plitude is a little bit larger than for plane waves
x cos2 θ
, and one can ﬁnd
by the factor exp
that it is not specular. The wave vector compo-
(cid:17)
nent kx of the reﬂected beam is larger than that
of the incident beam by the amount

and because of the energy conservation, the com-
ponent kz must be smaller than that of the inci-
dent wave. Thus the reﬂected beam slightly turns
from specular direction toward the interface.

Deviation of the reﬂected beam from specular
direction is easily understandable, if we take into
account that the reﬂection coeﬃcient is smaller
for larger qz. Thus the reﬂected beam is enriched
with smaller qz (and larger qx because of energy
conservation). Thus the average q of the reﬂected
beam deviates from the specular k.

We see that the spot center of the reﬂected beam
is shifted with respect to that of the incident one
by a distance ξx, which is the G-H shift. The re-
ﬂection in this case is completely specular. How-
ever, the phase kxx is identical to that of the inci-
dent wave, i.e. it does not contain the correction
kxξx, which we would expect because of the G-H
shift.

Above, we limited ourselves to the linear term in
the expansion of the exponent χ in (8). If we re-
tain quadratic terms we can ﬁnd the broadening
of the reﬂected beam. This, however, does not
bring any new insight because of the Gaussian
beam own broadening.

and calculate the integral (7) using the steepest
descent method. As a result the spot of the re-
ﬂected beam at the interface is deformed, and the
reﬂection is not exactly specular. This case will
be analyzed elsewhere, when it will be clear hot
to study properties of the single neutron wave
function experimentally.

2.4 The G-H shift for a wave packet

In the previous paragraph we consider the G-H
shift for a particle represented by a stationary
beam-like wave function. It is logical, however, to
describe a particle by a moving wave packet. The
wave packet is not a stationary wave function,
and its Fourier representation is

ψ0(r, t) =

A(q) exp(iqr

−

(18)

where all components of the vector q = (qk, qz)
are independent variables, and ωq = q2/2. For
coeﬃcients A(q) we use Gaussian function,

where s2t characterize spreading of the wave

Cross-section of the wave packet at the interface
depends on time. We can choose the time when
the wave packet center crosses the interface, t =

(25)

where k = (kk, kz), and the vector ˜ζ has compo-
nents ˜ζ = (0, 0, ˜ζz).

At the moment t = 0, when the incident wave
packet crosses the interface, the center of the re-
˜ζz under
ﬂected wave packet is at the point z =
the surface (depth C in ﬁg. 1). Thus, the real shift
is not in x-direction. It is in z-direction. However

−

because of motion of the reﬂected wave packet
its center crosses the interface. It happens at the
moment t = ˜ζz/kz, and at this moment the cen-
ter of the wave packet is located at rk = kk ˜ζz/kz.
This location is shifted with respect to center of
incident packet. So this shift well corresponds to
the intuitive understanding illustrated in ﬁg. 1,
and can be called the G-H shift (15).

It is important to note that the cross-section
of the wave packet at the interface has a circu-
lar form, not an elliptical form as in the case
of a beam. Since the linear expansion is valid
s, the G-H shift is ˜ζz ≪
for k′′
2/s, and
z ≫
ξk = 2kk ˜ζz/kz ≪
2kk/skz respectively.

neglecting spreading of the wave packet. As a

ζzs2), and ωk′ = k′2/2 <

We see that the center of the reﬂected wave
packet crosses the interface at the same moment
t = 0 and at the same point rk = 0 as the in-
cident wave packet, i.e. there are no G-H shift.
However, the momentum of the reﬂected wave
packet is less than that of the incident wave
packet. The normal component of the momen-
tum is less by the amount

(27)

δkz =

ζzs2,

−

6

which means non-specular reﬂection. The energy
ωk′ of the reﬂected wave is less than that of the
incident wave. However, since the total energy
should conserve after the elastic interaction with
the interface, the refracted wave has larger energy
than the incident wave.

The change in energy is the result of the indepen-
dent reﬂections of the diﬀerent plane waves, and
thus the result of the deformation of the wave
packet at the reﬂection. The higher is the nor-
mal component of the component plane wave, the
less is its reﬂection amplitude. To avoid such de-
formation we must assume that the wave packet
is an intimate property of the particle as, for
example, is in the case of the de Broglie wave
packet [12]. For the de Broglie wave packet the
energy after the reﬂection does not change, and
the decrease of the normal component of the
wave vector means that the direction of the re-
ﬂected wave packet is diﬀerent from specular one.

2.5 G-H shift for reﬂection from a layer on a

substrate

The G-H shift for the total reﬂection is usually
much smaller then the dimensions of the cross-
section of the wave function at the interface.
Since we assumed that k′′

The shift becomes considerably larger, if the mir-
ror consists of two parts as shown in ﬁg. 2. It
could be, for example, a layer of Al evaporated on
Be substrate. We denote the potential of the top
layer to be u1 and the bottom u2, and we choose
u2. We also choose, that the total reﬂection
u1
takes place at the second interface between the
layer and substrate. We can imagine, however,
that the total reﬂection happens instead at the
ﬁrst interface of the mirror, only this reﬂection
happens with a large G-H shift and with deep
propagation (comparable to the thickness of the
ﬁrst layer) into the mirror.

Figure 2. Reﬂection from a layer of thickness d
with the potential u1, placed on a substrate with
the potential u2 > u1. For a suﬃciently thick ﬁrst
layer the G-H shift AB can be arbitrary large.

Calculations of the shift for a beam-like wave
function or for a wave packet for the mirror in ﬁg.
2 are the same as before. The only diﬀerence is in
the form of the reﬂection amplitude in (7). It can
be calculated with the help of the method [10],
which takes into account multiple reﬂection of
plane waves from the two interfaces,

3 Possible experiments to measure the

neutron G-H eﬀect

In this section we estimate the value of the G-H
eﬀect and look into perspectives of its measure-
ment.

3.1 Nonspecular reﬂection from a single inter-

face

In case of a nontotal reﬂection of a beam,
the component kx = k sin θ (θ is the angle
of
incidence) of the wave vector in the re-
ﬂection plane along the interface increases by
2kxkzs2/k2k′
z(13). This is equivalent to rotating
of the wave vector by a small angle γ:

k′
x ≡

kx + δkx = kx + 2kxs2/kzk′

z =

k sin(θ + γ) = kx cos γ + kz sin γ.

(34)

In order to estimate γ we need to ﬁnd s.

The width s of the wave packet was estimated
in [13]. It was found that the anomalously high
loss coeﬃcient of ultracold neutrons in storage
vessels can be explained, if the wave function of
a neutron is represented by the de Broglie wave
10−5k, where k is
packet with the width s
the neutron wave number. We use this estimate
in the rest of this article.

to design an experiment with k′
0.1√u, then

z ≈

·

In the case of the wave packets the change of the
wave vector is determined by (27), δkz = 2s2/k′
z.
If this change is the result of the rotation by the
angle γ, then γ = 2s2/kxk′
z. Thus, using the same
estimates as in the previous paragraph we obtain
the same number for the angle γ.

We can check this result with the help of an ex-
periment, schematic of which is shown in ﬁg. 3.
In the proposed experiment, the reﬂection of the
monochromatic polarized neutrons from a mag-
netic mirror at a ﬁxed angle is measured. After re-
ﬂecting from the magnetic mirror, the polarized
neutrons go to a single crystal where the Bragg
condition is satisﬁed. After reﬂecting from the
crystal, the neutrons are registered by a detec-
tor. When neutrons are polarized parallel to the
magnetization of the mirror, they are totally and
specularly reﬂected from it. If the polarization is
opposite, the reﬂection is partial and not specu-
lar. The reﬂected beam from the mirror does not
completely satisfy Bragg condition at the single
crystal, so in order to restore the Bragg condition
we need to rotate the crystal. Thus the experi-
ment consists of measuring rocking curves of a

For thermal neutrons with λ = 2 ˚A the spatial
width of the wave packet is < 1µm, which is of
the order of magnitude less than the G-H shift.
However this changes, if the incident neutron in-
stead of the wave packet is described by a beam
of the same width. In this case we must compare
the G-H shift to 1/s cos θ, which is one order of
magnitude more than the G-H shift.

In the case of the reﬂection from a layer of thick-
ness, say 1 µm, on a substrate the G-H shift is
in the order of 0.8 mm and is considerably larger
even than 1/s cos θ.

This shift is possible to measure in the experi-
ment shown in ﬁg. 4. If a Cadmium (Cd) plate
restricts the area of the mirror enlightened by
the incident beam, then the detector will detect
only those particles, which can dive under the Cd
plate.

It is possible that the beam which passed under
the Cd plate will experience multiple reﬂections
from the vacuum-layer interface and from the
layer-substrate interface. In this case the distri-
bution of the neutrons at the position sensitive
detector (PSD in ﬁg. 4) will look like a diﬀrac-
tion pattern. In reality, however, this pattern will
be smeared by the non-monochromaticity and by
scattering from the interface roughness and from
the inhomogeneities of the ﬁlm. However the con-
tribution of scattering can be estimated and sep-
arated, if we can measure intensity of neutrons
scattered outside of the incidence plane.

Figure 3. Scheme of experiment to check deviation
of reﬂected neutrons from specular direction when
reﬂection is partial. Monochromatic polarized neu-
trons (pn) go through spin ﬂipper (SF) and are re-
ﬂected from a magnetized mirror (MM). If SF is
switched oﬀ then neutron polarization is parallel
to the mirror magnetization, reﬂection is total and
specular. The neutrons reﬂected from MM go to Si
single crystal and after Bragg reﬂection to detector
D. When SF is switched on, neutron polarization
becomes opposite to magnetization of MM and the
reﬂection is not total, thus the Bragg condition is
not satisﬁed for neutrons going to Si crystal. In or-
der to restore Bragg condition the Si crystal must
be turned by an angle γ. The purpose of the exper-
iment is to measure this angle.

single crystal for two neutron polarizations. The
centers of the two rocking curves will be shifted
by γ. Of course, to achieve suﬃcient precision we
need incident beam also monochromatized by an
identical single crystal. More over, to avoid some
false eﬀects the analysis, may require reﬂection
from two specially arranged single crystals. This
can be discussed for a concrete reﬂectometer.

3.2 G-H shift at total reﬂection

3.3 G-H eﬀect and coherence

Let us estimate the G-H shift (15) at the to-
tal reﬂection from a single interface. For thermal
neutrons the ratio kx/kz at the total reﬂection is
about 400. Thus the G-H shift is 400 times larger
than penetration depth 1/k′′
z , which can be es-
10−6 cm. Therefore, for
timated to be 1/√u
thermal neutrons the G-H shift is in the order of
8 µm.

≈

Reﬂection from two or more interfaces presents
a problem, which is worth while to carefully in-
vestigate. In such a reﬂection we ﬁnd coherence,
incoherence and a transition between them.

Indeed, expression (31) is the result of a coher-
ent superposition of plane waves instantaneously
reﬂected multiple (inﬁnite) times from two in-
terfaces. This expression is obtained as a sum of

9

It is interesting to check whether diﬀerent re-
ﬂected wave packets interfere with each other, or
the interference is present only when the spots
of the consecutively reﬂected waves on the in-
terface overlap (and is absent when they do not
overlap). If they do not interfere when the spots
do not overlap, then multiple reﬂections become
incoherent. If we can measure the reﬂection with
continuously changing overlapping, we can see
how coherence transforms into incoherence.

To check the phenomenon mentioned in the pre-
vious paragraph, the experiment depicted in ﬁg.
4 can be used. If the reﬂected beam is originated
at one point close to the one of incidence, then
it will be blocked by a cadmium shutter, and
no neutrons will be detected by the PSD. It will
prove the coherent summation of the reﬂected
amplitudes. However, if the multiple reﬂections
proceed according to (36), the distribution of the
neutrons on the PSD will be similar to a diﬀrac-
tion pattern.

There is also a diﬀerent way to check the transi-
tion of the coherence into the incoherence. Sup-
pose the reﬂection from the substrate is not total,
i.e. r12 is a positive real number less than unity.
In that case the full reﬂection amplitude (31) is
not a unit complex number

where every term represents a possible path of
the wave between the moment it enters the mir-
ror and the moment it exits the mirror. The wave
entering the mirror is deﬁned by the vacuum-
to-layer transmission amplitude t01 = 2qz/(qz +
q′
z), and the wave exiting the mirror is deﬁned
by layer-vacuum transmission amplitude t10 =
2q′
z). If we sum these multiple reﬂections,
and use the resulting reﬂection amplitude (31)
to ﬁnd reﬂected wave packet, we obtain a single
exit point for the packet. If we treat every term
of the sum separately and use series (36) to cal-
culate reﬂection of the wave packet, we obtain
many reﬂected wave packets each with diﬀerent
exit point. So the single G-H shift transforms into
multiple shifts. The coordinate of the n-th exit
point is proportional to nd. So the question is,
what the multiple reﬂections are in reality: are
they coherent sum of plane waves or a sequence
of incoherent reﬂections? If they are the coher-
ent sum, which can be expected, because of ob-
servable interference, then what do multiple exit
points mean?

The ﬁtting in the experiment [11] was done with
the coherence length and without it, and it was
found that χ2 of the ﬁtting improves consider-
ably, if the coherence length is included.

We show now how the coherence length, denoted
ξ0, was included in theoretical description of the
reﬂection curve shown in ﬁg. 5.

Let us introduce a function f (x), which monotonously
increases from zero at x = 0 to one at x =

sum

where Rc is coherent reﬂection amplitude, and
Ri is the incoherent reﬂection coeﬃcient. If x =
ξx/ξ0, then for small x, i.e. for a small separation
ξx compared to the coherence length ξ0, the re-
ﬂection is completely coherent. For a large sep-
aration ξx compared to the coherence length ξ0,
the reﬂection is completely incoherent. In [11] the
error function Φ(˜ξx/√2ξ0) is chosen to be f (x).

A reﬂectometer can be used to measure the re-
ﬂection amplitude dependence on energy of the
incident neutrons for a given incidence angle.
Example of such dependence is shown in ﬁg. 5
(reprinted from [11]) . The most interesting fea-
ture of this curve is the contrast of oscillations.
Period of oscillations is related only to the width
of the ﬁlm, but the contrast depends on many
factors, such as smearing of interfaces because of
the surfaces roughness [14], losses because of ab-
sorption, scattering on roughnesses and inhomo-
geneities, and possible contribution of incoherent
reﬂection.

In the experiment [11] the contribution of the
described factors was found by ﬁtting the theo-
retical curve (solid line in ﬁg. 5) to experimental
points. The smearing (for theory see, for exam-
ple [14]) was described by two parameters related
to two interfaces. The contribution of the inco-
herent reﬂection was described by the coherence
length parameter. The smearing parameter char-
acterizes the height of roughness. The coherence
length characterizes a certain separation of en-
ter and exit spots of the neutron wave function,
at which the coherent and incoherent contribu-
tions to the reﬂection coeﬃcient become equal.

where σ1,2 are smearing parameters of two inter-

The ﬁtting of the experimental data revealed
that the coherence parameter ξ0 is equal to 1.5
mm. Further research has to be done to under-
stand the meaning of this coherence parameter,
and how it relates to the width of the neutron
wave packet.

4 Conclusion

We discussed the G-H eﬀect in case of neutrons,
however almost everything said above is applica-
ble also to x-rays. The most important diﬀerence
is that we do not know how to estimate the wave
packet width for x-rays. The experiments similar
to those proposed in this article may give at least
an upper limit of this very interesting parameter.

We present a novel general framework to deal with forward and bakward omponents of the

eletromagneti (cid:28)eld in axially-invariant nonlinear optial systems, whih inlude those having any

type of linear or nonlinear transverse inhomogeneities. With a minimum amount of approximations,

we obtain a system of two (cid:28)rst-order equations for forward and bakward omponents expliitly

showing the nonlinear ouplings among them. The modal approah used allows for an e(cid:27)etive

redution of the dimensionality of the original problem from 3 + 1 (three spatial dimensions plus one
time dimension) to 1 + 1 (one spatial dimension plus one frequeny dimension). The new equations

an be written in a spinor Dira-like form, out of whih onserved quantities an be alulated in

an elegant manner. Finally, these new equations inherently inorporate spatio-temporal ouplings,

so that they an be easily partiularized to deal with purely temporal or purely spatial e(cid:27)ets.

Nonlinear forward pulse propagation and non-paraxial evolution of spatial strutures are analyzed

as examples.

eled using the Nonlinear Shrödinger Equation (NLSE)

[1℄. However, it is well known that NLSE needs mod-

propagation in (cid:28)bers (generalized NLSE and FME). On

II. MODAL SECOND-ORDER EQUATION

The most general equation for the propagation of

the eletri omponents of a eletromagneti (cid:28)eld in a

inhomogeneous,

isotropi and spatially loal dieletri

Eω(x, y, z) exp(−iωt), ∇ is the three-dimensional spa-

(cid:19)

Where now ∇t stands for the transverse gradient opera-

tor and the axial seond-order derivative has been made

expliit. Let us now perform a modal expansion of the

eletri (cid:28)eld in terms of the eigenmodes of the linear z -

independent system, desribed by the linear transverse

operator L0 ≡ ∇2

linear eigenvalue equation:

L0Φω

n(x, y) = β2

n(ω)Φω

n(x, y).

(4)

Sine L0 does not mix the spatial (polarization) ompo-

nents of the eletri (cid:28)eld, it is proportional to the iden-

tity operator in polarization spae. For this reason, its

eigenmodes have a three-fold degeneray in polarization

the loal nonlinear response of the medium to the propa-

indies. Therefore, every multiplet of eigenmodes is on-

gating (cid:28)eld. In the most general ase, the relative diele-

tri onstant (ǫ = n2

0 ) and the nonlinear funtion GN L

ω

an be either spatially loal (the ase we are onsidering)

or non-loal if there exist some type of spatially-delayed

response e(cid:27)ets. Besides the general wave equation (1),

Maxwell's equations require the onstraint ∇ · Dω = 0 to

be satis(cid:28)ed. Through the onstitutive relations, the dis-

plaement (cid:28)eld Dω is itself a funtion of the propagating
eletri (cid:28)eld Eω . Assuming a spatially loal response,
Dω = ǫ(Eω)Eω . In the ase the system presented some
type of anisotropy, ǫ(Eω) would be a seond-order tensor.
Here we onsider an isotropi medium, so that ǫ(Eω) will

be a salar funtion, although the generalization to an

stituted by three linearly independent modes, eah one

proportional to a three-dimensional vetor belonging to

n(x, y)u(σ)
(σ = 1, 2, 3) where the omponents of the anonial basis
{u(1), u(2), u(3)} satisfy u(σ)a = δσa (a = 1, 2, 3). If the
system is lossless then n0 = n∗
0 , and L0 is self-adjoint; if
it is not, we onsider the real part of n0 in Eq.(4) so that
L0 is again self-adjoint. In this way, the set of L0 eigen-
modes {Φω
n(σ)} form an orthogonal basis of funtions of

the transverse oordinates that an be used to expand

the eletri (cid:28)eld Eω(x, y, z) at a given z :

anisotropi medium is straightforward. The onstraint

relation has thus the form:

Eω(x, y, z) =

cn,σ(ω; z)Φω

n(x, y)u(σ),

∇ · (ǫ(Eω)Eω) = 0.

or, in omponents,

In most ases in nonlinear optis, the general onstraint

(2) is replaed by the approximated, and muh simpler,

(cid:16)salar(cid:17) ondition ∇ · (ǫ(Eω)Eω) ≈ ǫ(Eω)∇ · Eω = 0,
implying that ∇ · Eω ≈ 0. This approximation is known

to work well in a panoply of nonlinear e(cid:27)ets with few and

approahes the ontinuum-frequeny limit numerially.

Or, likewise in some experimental ases where one phys-

Besides, the dependene on modal indies of the T ten-

where T is a tensor in frequeny, modal and polariza-

sor is a result of the overlapping of spatial amplitudes,

tion indies that an be expliitly alulated out of the

ponents:

amplitudes of the linear (cid:28)ber modes. However, in or-

der to obtain the (cid:28)rst order ounterpart of the general

seond-order equation (8), it is not neessary to speify

a partiular form for the nonlinearity funtion F . It is

interesting to stress again that both the modal disper-

sion relations βn(ω) (or its disretized-frequeny version
βnj ) and F are inputs that are known one the mode

linear problem is solved. In order to simplify the nota-

tion, we will inorporate the polarization index into the

modal one when dealing with the spetral funtion c and
the nonlinear funtion F . This is possible beause polar-

ization and modal indies always ome together in pairs.

So that, from now on and without loss of generality, n
represents the index pair (n, σ) .

We perform now an axial Fourier transform on the

spetral funtions c in Eq.(8), de(cid:28)ned as

n(z) =

With this de(cid:28)nition, β → −id/dz (or, d/dz → iβ ),

and, thus, the axial Fourier transfom of Eq.(8) is given

by

(−β2 + β2

n(β) = − ˜F j

n(˜c),

where

˜F (˜c) is the axial Fourier transform of the nonlinear
˜F ≡ Fβ[F ]. Dividing this equation by
nj (we assume some kind of (cid:16)iǫ(cid:17) presription to

term in Eq.(8):

−β2 + β2

deal with the poles of the inverse of this funtion in the

interesting to notie that small values of the bakward

spetrum imply small nonlinearities, as it an be heked

by going to the cB → 0 limit in Eqs.(14) or (17).

In

suh a limit, nonlinearities dissapear independently of

the nature of their origin: F (c) → 0. We will return to

this point in the last setion of this paper.

V. CONSERVED QUANTITIES

The goal of this setion is to (cid:28)nd the onserved quan-

tity assoiated to FBEs in the most general ase. Our

only assumption will be the onservative and lossless

harater of the system, whih mathematially will be

re(cid:29)eted in the fat that the M operator is self-adjoint
(M = M †
) and that the dispersion relation funtion β

is real for all modes. We onsider as a starting point

(19)

the disrete-frequeny FBEs in their spinor representa-

tion (21). Now we proeed to rede(cid:28)ne the labeling of this

equation following the same proedure we used to inor-

porate polarization indies into modal indies in Setion

III. Sine frequeny (j ) and modal indies (n) are always

paired together in Eq.(21), we an inorporate both in a

(20)

new single index: (n, j) → p, (n′, j′) → p'. In this way,

Eq.(21) beomes (a sum over repeated indies is assumed,

and the Pauli matries,

as before):

M are proportional to the identity matrix when they at

on the F − B omponents of the bi-spinor Ψ, and for this

reason they ommute with Pauli matries. Next, we left-

multiply Eq.(24) by Ψ†Bσ3 and right-multiply Eq.(25)
by Bσ3Ψ, to obtain (σ2

6

(16) and (17) mix F − B omponents due to the presene
of the nonlinear funtion F (c) = F (cF + cB) in the right
hand side of both equations. When F − B interations
an be negleted, what happens when either cF or cB

are very small, FBEs deouple and we obtain two sep-

arate equations for cF and cB . In suh a ase, forward

(sine B is

and bakward axial (cid:29)uxes are onserved independently:

dQF /dz = 0 and dQB/dz = 0. The demonstration of

this property losely follows the general proof previously

desribed for the total (cid:29)ux Q. Let us onsider FBEs in

their disrete-frequeny form (Eqs.(13) and (14)) when

all F − B mixing terms are negleted; that is, when
F (c) ≈ F (cF ) in Eq.(13) beause c ≈ cF (cB ≈ 0) or
F (c) ≈ F (cB) in Eq.(14) beause c ≈ cB (cF ≈ 0). We

will onsider forward omponents only (bakward analy-

sis is ompletely analogous). By relabelling the frequeny

and modal indies together into a new index and by in-

troduing the matrix notation in the same way we used

In this ase, the equation for the bakward omponent

would orrespond to a very weak (cid:28)eld (cB ≈ 0) and,
thus, it would be basially linear: −i˙cB ≈ −BcB . For

our purposes, we also need the adjoint equation of (28):

When one neglets F − B interations, for example

Aording to what was explained in Setion III, the fun-

From a symmetry point of view, this an be understood

out of the mode amplitudes of the linear propagation

by the fat that FBEs (16) and (17) are no longer in-

problem together with the standard nonlinear oe(cid:30)ients

variant under independent F − B phase transformations
(c = cF + cB → ˜c = eiθF cF + eiθB cB ) beause in that
ase M (˜c) = M (eiθF cF + eiθB cB) 6= M (cF + cB) = M (c),

(χ(3), χ(5)
, . . .). Thus, many formal properties of M will
be inherited from linear modes. The dependene of M on

modal indies and frequeny will have muh to do with

as an be easily heked for a ubi nonlinearity. Us-

the partiular dependene of the linear mode amplitudes

ing the language of group theory, one would state that

on spatial oordinates and frequeny. Di(cid:27)erent physi-

U (1)F ⊗ U (1)B symmetry is broken. However, there

ally well-grounded assumptions on the properties of M

is a residual phase symmetry remaining in FBEs (16)

on modal (and polarization) indies and frequeny an

and (17) when U (1)F ⊗ U (1)B invariane is broken by
F − B interations. FBEs are still invariant under simul-
taneous global phase tranformations on F and B om-
ponents (cF → eiθcF and cB → eiθcB , whih implies
c → eiθc) provided that M (eiθc) = M (c). Notie that
this U (1) symmetry is a partiular ase of the higher-
order U (1)F ⊗U (1)B symmetry when θF = θ and θB = θ.
Sine U (1)F ⊗ U (1)B symmetry is broken, the U (1)F
harge, i.e, the F axial (cid:29)ux (QF ), and the U (1)B harge,
i.e., the B axial (cid:29)ux (−QB ), are not onserved. However,
in suh a situation the remaining U (1) symmetry guaran-

be then made by analyzing linear mode harateristis.

The seond element to take into aount is the exten-

sion of the frequeny spetrum cF (ω). A onsiderable

simpli(cid:28)ation is ahieved for su(cid:30)iently narrow spetra,

whereas wide bandwiths, as those naturally appearing in

highly-nonlinear (cid:28)bers (e.g., in superontinuum genera-

In nonlinear propagation in optial single-mode (cid:28)bers

it is ommonly assumed that the spatial dependene of

the eletri propagating (cid:28)eld is just given by the ampli-

tude of the fundamental mode of the (cid:28)ber. In our on-

text, this statement is equivalent to say that the matrix

M is one-dimensional and involves the fundamental mode

only. The equation desribing forward nonlinear propa-

gation in suh a (cid:28)ber would be Eq.(31) for n = 0 (funda-

mental mode). Even if the (cid:28)ber is not single-mode but in-

volves modes widely separated by large gaps in β 's, as in

some highly-nonlinear miroestrutured (cid:28)bers, the same

equation an still remain approximately valid. The rea-

son is that in suh a ase intermodal interations are rel-

atively suppressed with respet to modal self-interations

beause of the very di(cid:27)erent forms of linear mode ampli-

tudes, originated by both the disrete symmetry of the

(cid:28)ber and their very di(cid:27)erent values of β , leading to zero

or small overlapping integrals and, thus, to small val-

ues of Mnn′

when n 6= n′

. The resulting approximated

equation (cid:22)Eq.(31) restrited to the fundamental mode

(n = 0)(cid:22) is equivalent to the Forward Maxwell Equa-

As mentioned in Setion III, and it is also evident in

Eq.(35), the omplete elimination of bakward ompo-

(M → 0). Conversely, if M 6= 0 then bakward ompo-
nents are neessarily generated: φB 6= 0 (even if they did

not initially exist). Therefore, there exists a lose link

between bakward amplitudes and the nonlinear fun-

In order to larify the alulation, we parametrize the

(cid:16)size(cid:17) of the nonlinearity by rede(cid:28)ning the nonlinear fun-

tion as M = γ ¯M , where γ is a dimensionless real parame-
ter. In this way, we an approah the linear ase (M → 0)
by taking the limit γ → 0. It is easy to realize that γ has
to be proportional to the input power γ ∼ P when γ is
small. Certainly, M is a funtion of the input power ver-
ifying that M → 0 as P → 0. Assuming, as usual, that
this dependene is analytial this implies that M ∼ P
when P → 0. The same argument for γ leads to M ∼ γ
for small values of γ . Therefore, the small γ and the
small P regimes are, in fat, the same one. From a phys-

ial point of view, this provides a physial meaning to

the dimensionless parameter γ in the small nonlinearity
regime: γ ∼ P . Notie that, in the general ase of a
nonlinearity that an be expanded in power series in φ,
¯M an depend itself on γ .

the auxiliar nonlinear funtion

However, for our purposes, it is enough to onsider that

M = O(γ) ( and thus

¯M = O(1)) beause we are going

to be interested in leading order terms.

Following the reasoning above, we onsider the total

(cid:28)eld amplitude as the sum of a large forward amplitude

and a small bakward amplitude: φ = φF + δφB . Be-

Therefore, negleting bakward omponents is equiv-

alent to onsider FBEs up to O(γ)2

terms. Or, equiv-

alently, the pure forward equation (that is, FBEs with

φ ≈ φF and φB ≈ 0) is just a weak-nonlinearity approx-

imation. More spei(cid:28)aly, it is the leading-order ontri-

bution in the nonlinear parameter γ to FBEs. For this

reason, it is possible to (cid:28)nd equivalent forms to the for-

ward equation di(cid:27)erent than (38). An interesting alter-

by using the following property

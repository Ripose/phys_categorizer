Abstract

By suitably using the properties of anomalous refraction in the anisotropic metamaterial (AMM),

we introduce a very simple and very eﬃcient beam splitter constructed by an AMM slab to route the

light. We show that the splitting angle and the splitting distance between E- and H- polarized beam

can be precisely controlled by tuning anisotropic parameters, incident angle and slab thickness. The

validity of these analytical results is checked by means of extensive numerical simulations.

Polarizing beam splitters are an important device in optical systems, such as polarization-

independent optical isolators, polarization-based imaging systems and optical switches [1, 2].

A conventional polarization beam splitter is made of a regular anisotropic crystal or a

multi-layer transparent material [3, 4]. The separation between E- and H-polarized beams

produced by these conventional anisotropic crystal is typically limited by the small splitting

angle. While a large beam splitting angle and splitting distance (or walk-oﬀ distance) are

preferable for practical applications, especially in the ﬁeld of optical communication systems.

The recent advent of anisotropic metamaterial (AMM), which does not necessarily re-

quire that all tensor elements of ε and µ have negative values, has attained considerable

attention [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. E- and H-polarized waves in a certain AMM will exhibit opposite

amphoteric refractions, such as one polarized waves are positively refracted whereas the

other polarized waves are negatively refracted [10, 11]. The opposite amphoteric refractions

in the AMM oﬀer further opportunities to extend the design in optical communication.

In the present work we will present a design of polarization beam splitters based on the

opposite amphoteric refractions. The polarization beam splitter consists of an AMM slab as

shown in Fig. 1. For anisotropic materials one or both of the permittivity and permeability

are second-rank tensors. To simplify the proceeding analysis, we assume the permittivity

and permeability tensors are simultaneously diagonalizable:

where εi and µi (i = x, y, z) are the permittivity and permeability constants in the principal

coordinate system.

We assume plane wave E(r, t) = Re[E(r) exp(

iωt)] and B(r, t) = Re[B(r) exp(

ensures that light power propagates away from the surface to the +z direction.

The incident angle of light is given by θI = tan−1[kx/kz]. Based on the boundary condi-

tion, the tangential components of the wave vectors must be continuous, i.e., qx = kx. Then

the ﬁrst interface of the AMM slab has been discussed. The refraction at the second interface

can be investigated by the similar procedures.

The experiment measurements are proposed on a metamaterial based on the unit cell as

shown in Fig. 2(a). This geometry was originally tuned at infrared frequencies and has been

scaled and optimized here for the purpose of experiment. The directions of the rings and rods

axes yielding the corresponding permittivity and permeability tensor elements described by

Drude and Lorentz models, respectively [8, 9]. It is now conceivable that a metamaterial

can be constructed whose permittivity and permeability values may be designed to vary

independently and arbitrarily throughout a metamaterial, taking positive or negative values

as desired [12].

Here we set εy to be Durude models while µz to be Lorentz model. Using the same

notation as in Ref. [8], the respective resonance and resonant frequencies are fep

Ignoring the metallic structure, the

background material which is dominantly an anisotropic magnetic material leads us to use

εx = εz = 1 and µx = µy = 1. The available frequency contour will be used to determine

the refracted waves as plotted in Fig. 2(b). It is interesting to note that E-polarized waves

undergo negative refraction, while H-polarized waves exhibit positive refraction.

Based on the boundary condition, we can obtain the following expression for the reﬂection

The conventional beam splitter requires a large thickness to generate enough walk-oﬀ dis-

tance between the two polarizations owing to the intrinsically small birefringence of naturally

anisotropic materials [1, 2]. Fortunately, the opposite amphoteric refraction associated with

AMM can reduce the thickness considerably.

In general, to distinguish the positive and

negative refraction, we must calculate the direction of the Poynting vector with respect to

the wave vector [11]. From Eqs. (5) and (6) we can see that the refracted waves will be

determined by µz for E-polarized incident waves and εz for H-polarized incident waves. The

underlying secret of the opposite amphoteric refractions is that εz and µz always have the

opposite signs.

The splitting angle between E- and H-polarized waves can be deﬁned as

The opposite amphoteric refractions suggest that a large splitting angle can be obtained

by tuning the anisotropic parameters. The splitting distance between E- and H-polarized

waves can be expressed as a functions of anisotropic parameters, the incident angle and the

slab thickness:

d = cos θI(tan βH

tan βE

S )l,

S −

(9)

where d is the splitting distance and l is the thickness of slab. By varying the thickness

of the AMM slab, the splitting distance between the two output beams can be precisely

controlled. Hence the large splitting angle and splitting distance allow us to introduce the

potential device acting as an eﬃcient polarization beam splitter.

To construct an eﬃcient splitter, we wish both E- and H-polarized waves can totally trans-

mit through the AMM slab. Our motivation here is to realize E-polarized waves undergo

the oblique total transmission while the reﬂections of H-polarized waves exhibit omnidirec-

tional total transmission. Fortunately the media parameters of AMM slab can be tuned to

meet the requirements [11]. We thus choose the incident angle equal to the Brewster angle

θI = θE

B, then the reﬂections of E- and H-polarized waves are completely absent.

To obtain a better physical picture of the polarization beam splitter, let us consider a

Gaussian beam with a beam waist w0 incident from vacuum. We want the Gaussian beam

to be aligned with the incident direction deﬁned by the vector k0 = k0 cos θI ex + k0 sin θIez,

which makes the incident angle equal to the Brewster angle. For the purpose of illustration,

the spatial map of the electric ﬁelds are plotted in Fig. 4. The AMM slab behaves as

slab is almost exactly the analytical expression in Eq. (8). E- and H-polarized beams are

separated by d = 14.8w0 after propagating through the AMM slab with a thickness of
20◦ [3, 4], the

10w0. Compared with the conventional polarization beam splitters with Φ

≃

present polarization beam splitters are more simple and more eﬃcient. Our numerical results

indicate that it is advantageous to employ the AMM slab as polarization beam splitter at

infrared frequencies.

Abstract

The temperature dependence of the signal gain of an erbium-doped ﬁber ampliﬁer
(EDFA) pumped at 1480 nm are theoretically and numerically examined by solving
the propagation equations with the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission (ASE). It is seen
that the temperature dependence of the gain strongly depends on the distribution of
population of Er3+-ions in the second level as well as the ﬁber length, pump and signal
wavelengths. In addition, the output pump power and the intrinsic saturation power of
the signal beam are obtained as a function of the temperature. Numerical calculations
show that the values predicted from the analytic expressions depend on not only the
gain parameters of EDFAs, but also the temperature range of − 20 oC to +60 oC.

Keywords: Er-doped ﬁber ampliﬁer (EDFA), temperature-dependent signal gain, propaga-

tion equations, ASE.

1 Introduction

EDFAs have been presenting many advantages such as high gain and low noise in the op-

tical communication networks and providing a broadband ampliﬁcation of radiation whose

wavelength is in the so-called third window for ﬁber-optic communication (∼1530 nm). In

addition, the temperature dependence of EDFAs gain characteristics has also of great im-

portance for WDM ampliﬁed systems [1]. In the previous works, an analytic solution of the

rate equation has been derived and the gains at optimum ampliﬁer lengths have been found

as experimental at the various temperature values [2, 3]. The theoretical and experimen-

tal results for the temperature dependence of gain in the various lengths of EDFAs have

been reported, but the temperature dependence of the analytic expressions has not been

given [4]. Afterwards, the theoretical analysis of ampliﬁcation characteristics of EDFAs has

been developed to calculate the signal gain, using the rate equation model, [5], and this

rate equation has been modiﬁed by including the temperature and cross section factors to

understand the dependence of the gain for EDFAs pumped at 1480 nm to the temperature

[6, 7]. In this article, we present an analytic expression for the signal gain in EDFAs, using

the propagation equations improved by considering the temperature range of − 20 oC to

+60 oC. We regard the ampliﬁers spontaneous emission (ASE) while neglecting the excited

state absorption (ESA) eﬀect.

2 Theory

The simplest treatment of EDFA considers the two-level ampliﬁcation system with energy

levels as shown in Figure 1, when it is pumped at 1480 nm. In this ﬁgure, level 1 is the ground
level and level 2 is the metastable level characterized by a long lifetime τ (= γ−1), Ra,e
p

is the

pump absorption and stimulated emission rates, S12,21 is the signal stimulated absorption
and emission rates, respectively. N2+ and N2− are the populations of Er3+ ions within the

sub-levels of the second energy state and it is possible to consider each of them as a single

energy level.

In actual fact, this system contains many sub-levels where the erbium-ions

actually reside. The sub-levels are unequally populated due to the thermal distribution of

the ions within the energy state relating to the second level. Thus, the relative occupation of

the sub-levels in the thermal equilibrium must be arranged as a function of the temperature.

This arrangement is performed by Boltzmann’s distribution law:

∆E2 = E2+ − E2− [8]. C +

corresponding to the two levels 1 and 2 can be given as follow

3 Results and discussion

In summary, we can obtain the relationship between the ﬁber length and the gain in the

following way. Firstly, we take f (r) in Gaussian form, f (r) = exp(−r2/ω2

0 where ω0 is
the spot size and the eﬀective core area is πω2
0 = 33 µm2. N(r) is assumed to be in Gaussian
form, N(r) ≃ exp(−r2/ω2)/πω2. In addition, the ratio of width between Gaussian dopant

0)/πω2

distribution and transverse intensity proﬁle (ω/ω0) is selected as 0.3. We can obtain R and

αs by using N(r) and f (r) for the relevant ﬁber parameters for the second time. Thus, the

output pump power can be calculated in the diﬀerent temperature values. In this case, it is

bear in mind that the ratio of cross-sections which are belong to the signal beam depends on

the temperature. To calculate the parameter η as a function of temperature, we beneﬁt from

McCumber’s theory gives a relation between emission and absorption cross section that is

highly accurate [9].

In the numerical calculations, we select the Al/P-silica erbium-doped ﬁber as an ampliﬁer

operated at the pump wavelength λp = 1480 nm and the input pump power Pp(0) is ﬁxed at

30 mW . The used signal wavelength λs and the signal power Ps(0) are 1530 nm and 10 µW ,

5

respectively. The other parameters assigned to the ﬁber are given in Table 1 [10]. Moreover,

we use the simulation programme OptiAmpliﬁer 4.0 developed Optiwave Corporation for all
aspects of EDFAs, and then in order to generate P +

ASE(L) only, we set up the basic system

seen in Figure 2 [11]. The other calculations in our study are made by us so as to obtain

the numerical results. Thus, we insert the result obtained into the gain equation in Eq.(17).

In the frame of our temperature dependent model, the energy diﬀerence between N2+ and
N2− populations of the 4I13/2 (metastable) level is ﬁnally assumed as 300 cm−1 in the room

temperature for the simplicity. The results calculated for the output pump power and the

intrinsic saturation power as well as the parameters β and η are given in Table 2. The relation

between the signal gain and the ﬁber length is illustrated in Figure 3 for the temperatures

−20 oC, 20 oC and 60 oC. For a given pump and signal powers the gain decreases with

increasing temperature within the range of L ≤ 27 m. The gain variation between −20 and

60 oC is 0.67 dB in the region of the maximum gain. It is very interesting to note that there

is a temperature insensitive length about L ≈ 30 m for the relevant pump and signal powers.

On the other hand, this temperature insensitive length is equivalent to the length at which

the gain curves cross each other in Figure 3. Therefore, the simple theoretical investigations

are useful in real cases.

4 Conclusion

We have obtained simple analytic expressions for the signal gain and ﬁber length of the

erbium-doped ﬁber ampliﬁer in the temperature range from − 20 to +60 oC. We The tem-

perature dependence reported in this paper for the output pump power is smaller than that

of the intrinsic saturation power. Thus, in the practical applications we can neglect the de-

pendence of the output pump power to temperature. However, it is taken into consideration

that the gain performance of EDFAs strongly depends on the temperature.

Abstract

The proposed paradigm of plasmonic atoms and plasmonic molecules allows one to describe and

predict the strongly localized plasmonic oscillations in the clusters of nanoparticles and some other

nanostructures in uniform way. Strongly localized plasmonic molecules near the contacting surfaces

might become the fundamental elements (by analogy with Lego bricks) for a construction of fully

integrated opto-electronic nanodevices of any complexity and scale of integration.

INTRODUCTION

A technological break-through in the fabrication of nanodimensional clusters and other

metallic nanoparticles gave rise to a development of such nano-technological and nanoop-

tical branch as nanoplasmonics, which is of great interest to physicists, chemists, material

engineers, IT specialists, and biologists. The nanoplasmonics deals with conduction electron

liquid oscillations in metallic nanostructures and nanoparticles, and an interaction of those

oscillations with light (plasmon-polariton) [1, 2]. Such studies are also aimed at the oscil-

lations of a crystal lattice (SiC, for example) in the nanoparticles, whose interaction with

light has much in common with the plasmon oscillations (phonon-polariton) [3].

The important feature of nanoplasmonic phenomena is the combination of a strong spatial

localization and high-frequency (from ultraviolet to infrared) of electron oscillations. In its

turn, strong localization leads to a giant enhancement of the local optical and electrical ﬁelds.

These important features of plasmonic particles made it possible to discover quite a number

of new eﬀects. One of the most developed is the use of large local ﬁelds near plasmonic

nanoparticles for enhancement of the Raman scattering cross-section. Recent experiments

have shown that such an increase may achieve 10-14 orders of magnitude, which may help

to resolve single molecules [4]-[7]. The local enhancement of the ﬁelds can also be used to

increase the ﬂuorescence intensity and to determine the structure of a single DNA strand

without using the ﬂuorescent labels [8]-[9]. By using the nanoparticles of more complex shape

one can provide enhancement of both the absorption and the emission of light by natural and

artiﬁcial ﬂuorophores [10]. On the other hand, the plasmon nanoparticles are proposed to

be used in nanolasers [11] and to stimulate plasmonic oscillations in nanoparticles by means

of the optical emission (SPASER) [12]. Beside these new applications of the plasmonic

nanoparticles, one can essentially increase the eﬃciency-cost ratio, for example, in solar

batteries or light emitting diodes [13, 14] by using the achievements in nanoplasmonics.

And ﬁnally, it is awaited that the nanoplasmonics will make it possible to create a new

element base (Genuine Integrated Optics and Ultracompact Optical Components) for the

computers and data processing equipment by taking an advantage of small dimensions of

metallic nanoparticles and fast speed of optical processes [15].

An intricate spatial structure of the physical phenomena, which form the basis of

nanoplasmonics, impedes a development of the latter. Very often, the numerical studies

2

do not allow one to explain the physics of the observed phenomena, while the analytical

studies are mostly devoted to the case of spherical and spheroidal nanoparticles, which are

very far from the synthesized nanostructures from the viewpoint of geometry and physics.

Separate nanoparticles are often approximated by point dipoles. This permits one to ex-

plain several phenomena (for example, a propagation of plasmons in a chain of nanoparticles

[16]). But as a whole, the physics of plasmonic oscillations in complex nanostructures and

nanoparticles remains insuﬃciently studied, and to make progress in this ﬁeld one needs

new approaches and new ideas.

As one of such approaches we suggest that the plasmonic eﬀects observed in clusters of

nanoparticles should be described by the paradigm of plasmonic atoms and molecules, which

has much in common with the paradigm of normal atoms and molecules. This would allow

one to explain the complex phenomena of nanoplasmonics in terms of atomic and molecular

physics, and to propose quite a number of new applications of the nanoplasmonics.

Within the framework of our approach we propose to treat the plasmonic oscillations of

the connected nanoparticles as the plasmonic atoms. The plasmonic atoms are analogous,

in a certain way, to the electron oscillations at the nanocrystal quantum dots, which are also

often called the artiﬁcial atoms [17].

The bound states of plasmonic atoms in the clusters of nanoparticles are proposed to be

called the plasmonic molecules, and ﬁnally, the plasmonic oscillations in the nanoparticle

gratings are proposed to be called the plasmonic crystals. Such an approach seems to be

eﬃcient and useful as it follows from the strongly localized plasmonic oscillations recently

discovered in the clusters of spherical nanoparticles [18, 19, 20]. These oscillations, being

localized and of short-range, represent the plasmonic molecules, and on their basis it is pos-

sible to create diﬀerent kinds of plasmonic nanostructures and to develop new nanodevices

(optical nanosensors of single molecules, nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS [21]), and

even plasmonic computers).

II. PLASMONIC ATOMS

Let us consider in more detail the analogy between the plasmonic and ordinary atoms.

In the simplest case of a hydrogen atom, the energy levels are deﬁned by the Bohr equation

where E1=13.55 eV is the ionization energy of hydrogen atom. The wave function of an

electron has the form, in this case:

where Znl is the radial part of the wave function, and Y m

, the spherical harmonic. For

example, in the case of the ﬁrst excited (2P) atomic state, the expression for the radial

function takes the form:

In the case of a spherically symmetric plasmonic atom, i.e. the plasmonic oscillations in

a metallic spherical nanoparticle of the radius R0, under the Drude dispersion law ε (ω) =
(ωpl/ω)2 (where ωpl is bulk plasmon frequency), the spectrum of the plasmonic oscillations

where n = 1, 2, 3, ... and Nn is some constant. Function (5) for the index n = 1 is illustrated

in Fig. 1 by a dotted line. It is seen from this ﬁgure that wave functions of the ordinary and

plasmonic atoms are similar. The spectra (1) and (4) also have much in common.

The plasmonic oscillations have similar properties in the other spherically symmetrical

layered systems (nanomatreshka) [22] and spheroidal nanoparticles (nanorice) [23].

The resonant plasmonic frequencies and potentials of plasmonic atoms in more complex

and less symmetrical nanoparticles have a more complex form. For example, in the case of a

4

metallic nanoparticle having a form of a three-axial ellipsoid with the semi-axes a1 > a2 > a3,

the plasmonic frequencies will be deﬁned by the ratio [24]

Figure 4 illustrates schematically the surface charge distribution for several states of a

cubic plasmonic atom as found in [27]. The experiments studying the cubic plasmonic atoms

in [31] proved to be in an agreement with the theoretical calculations.

It is very important that both the plasmonic atom wavefunction (electric potential) and

the ﬁeld intensity are changing within the whole volume of a nanoparticle and the adjacent

space, despite the fact that the structure of plasmonic atoms may be rather complex. By

analogy with that, the surface charge in any plasmonic atom changes noticeably over the

whole nanoparticle surface. Such a smeared spatial structure of plasmonic atoms is their

5

characteristic feature, and can be used in quite a number of applications such as nanosensors

of single molecules. However, as the distance between nanoparticles decreases they start to

interact more intensively. And instead of the plasmonic atoms it is expedient to use the con-

ception of plasmonic molecules to describe the plasmonic oscillations in the closely situated

and strongly interacting nanoparticles. As in the case of ordinary atoms and molecules, the

question about the existence of bound states of the plasmonic atoms emerges here ﬁrst of

all.

III. PLASMONIC MOLECULES IN A TWO-SPHERE CLUSTER

The evidence for the existence of bound states of the plasmonic atoms was ﬁrst provided

in [18, 19] by the example of a cluster of two closely sitiated spherical nanoparticles (Fig. 5).

Generally speaking, the plasmonic oscillations in the cluster of two nanoparticles were

studied earlier too [32]-[37]. However, it was assumed, both explicitly and implicitly, that

the bound states are not formed in such a cluster, and the interaction assumes a scattering of

plasmonic atoms on each other with a respective splitting of energy levels, and hybridization

of wave functions (potentials) of single plasmonic atoms [36, 37]. That was the reason why

the plasmonic molecules had not been predicted earlier.

The discovered by us spectrum of the plasmonic oscillations in a cluster of two spherical

nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 6 for the case of identical spheres (R1 = R2 = R0). There are

only symmetrical (T-modes) and antisymmetrical (L-modes) states of the scattering within

the range of ω < ωpl/√2 (ε <

1). They exist at any distance between the particles, and

−

continuously transit into the respective states of the weakly interacting plasmonic atoms

with the characteristics (4) and (5), within large distances between the nanospheres. Just

those scattering states had become the subject of investigations in [32]-[37].

In the region of ωpl ≥

ω > ωpl/√2 (0 > ε >

1) the plasmonic oscillations may exist

−

only at small distances between the nanoparticles, and correspond to the bound states of

the plasmonic atoms and molecules (M-modes). Note that the existence of the plasmonic

molecules is by no means connected with a quasistatical approximation, and the calculations

made within the framework of the total system of Maxwell’s equations, with account for

retardation eﬀects, provide evidence for the existence of plasmonic molecules in the case of

a small gap as compared with the radii of spheres (Guzatov, Klimov unpublished).

6

The analogous spectra appear for higher azimuthal numbers m, although there are some

peculiarities in the spectra of the unbound plasmonic atoms.

In the region of small distances between the nanospheres, the properties of the plasmonic

molecules may be studied analytically within quasistatic approximation. For the Drude

dispersion law, the spectrum of the plasmonic molecules takes the form:

In the case of large azimuthal numbers, m

1, one can also ﬁnd simple asymptotic

equations for the spectra of plasmonic oscillations in a cluster of two spheres. This case is

of importance for calculation of van der Waals forces between nanoparticles.

Consider in more detail a structure of the wave functions (electric potentials) of the

plasmonic molecules. Figure 7 illustrates a wave function spatial distribution of a plasmonic

molecule and unbound states of plasmonic atoms in the x-z plane.

Spatial structure of antisymmetrical (L-modes) and symmetrical (T-modes) wave func-

tions of the unbound plasmonic atoms, in the axis-symmetrical case (m = 0) corresponds

to the structure of wave functions of the isolated atoms. Namely, a positive charge lies in

one part of a sphere, while a negative charge, which is equal to the positive one due to

the electrical neutrality of spheres, lies in the opposite part of the latter. An interaction

between the plasmonic atoms is reduced, in this case, to a charge re-distribution on opposite

semi-spheres.

vanish.

In the case of plasmonic molecules (symmetrical M-modes), the situation is the opposite,

and both positive and negative charges are concentrated in a small region near a gap between

the nanospheres. Far from the gap, the wave functions of plasmonic molecules practically

In the case of m = 1, where the wave functions have an angular dependence cos ϕ or sin ϕ,

the situation is analogous. The only diﬀerence is that the dipole moments of the unbound

plasmonic atoms and molecules are directed along the x- or y-axis.

As a whole, the wave function of the plasmonic atoms remains more or less distributed

over the volume of both nanospheres, whereas the plasmonic molecules are strongly localized

8

near the gap between the nanospheres in a region with a characteristic dimension of the order

of the gap size with the maxima at spherical surfaces.

A strong localization of the plasmonic modes is also well seen in Fig. 8, which shows a

distribution of the (surface) charge over a surface of spheres. To plot these distributions

we have used a polar system of coordinates (ρ, θ) for each sphere in plane y = 0. The

surface charge distribution was depicted with ρ = R0 (1 + ˜σ (θ)) polar curve where ˜σ (θ) is

the dimensionless surface charge density as a function of polar angle of corresponding sphere.

As the distance between the spheres increases, the localization of the plasmonic molecules

decreases. At critical distance between the spheres the plasmonic molecules disappear,

whereas the unbound atoms do not change.

The localization of plasmonic molecules and unbound plasmonic atoms is diﬀerent, which

deﬁnes their diﬀerent dependence on the exciting radiation. The polarizability of the un-

bound plasmonic atoms is of the order of a nanosphere volume α

R3

0, and they eﬀectively

∼

interact with the uniform external ﬁelds of the respective orientation and symmetry. And

on the contrary, the plasmonic molecules have a comparatively small polarizability α

∆3,

∼

where ∆ is the value of the gap between the spheres. As a result, the plasmonic molecules

are weakly excited by the uniform optical ﬁelds (as compared to the unbound plasmonic

states). On the other hand, the plasmonic molecules interact eﬀectively with strongly in-

homogeneous ﬁelds that are localized near the gap between the spheres. Such ﬁelds are

produced by the atomic and molecular radiation near the gap. This makes the plasmonic

molecules extremely perspective from the viewpoint of a development of nanosensors and el-

ements of the nanodevices, which are sensitive to single molecules. Quite probably, that the

SERS from single molecules [4]-[7] is due to their interaction with the plasmonic molecules.

It seems that hot points in fractal structures (Shalaev’s hot spots [38]) are also due to the

plasmonic molecules.

NANOPARTICLES

IV. PLASMONIC MOLECULES IN MORE COMPLICATED SYSTEMS OF

Above we considered the plasmonic molecules and unbound states of the plasmonic atoms

formed in a cluster of two identical nanospheres. However, the plasmonic molecules may

be formed within a much wider set of clusters of the nanoparticles. The only necessary

9

condition for the formation of plasmonic molecules is smallness of the gap between the

nanoparticles of the ﬁnite volume as compared to their characteristic dimensions. The

plasmonic molecules may also be formed in connected particles with two or more nanobubbles

or dielectric nanospheres inside them (Fig. 9).

A. Cluster made from diﬀerent nanospheres

First of all, the plasmonic molecules can exist in a cluster of two diﬀerent nanospheres.

Here the spectra and wave functions of unbound plasmonic atoms and plasmonic molecules

are completely analogous to the case of identical nanospheres. If the distance between the

spheres is small, then the plasmonic molecule spectrum may be written in the form:

B. Cluster made of two nonspherical particles

Strong localization of plasmonic molecules allows one to suggest that their characteristics

depend mainly on the radius of curvature of almost contacting surfaces and the distance

10

(15)

(16)

(17)

between the centers of the inscribed (or circumscribed) spheres. So, for any smooth non-

spherical particle the properties of plasmonic molecules formed in the gap may be estimated

by considering the plasmonic molecules in two spheres, which approximate the nonspherical

particles in the contact point (see Fig. 10).

For the closely set semi-inﬁnite bodies the situation turns to be more intricate, since in

this case part of the charges may go arbitrary far from the contact area. Nevertheless, here

exist a localized plasmonic oscillations, which are analogous to the antisymmetric unbound

plasmonic atoms (L-modes) and plasmonic molecules (M-modes).

In case of closely set semi-inﬁnite hyperboloids (Fig. 11a) the variables in Laplace equa-

tion can be separated within prolate spheroid coordinates [39], and the localized plasmonic

oscillation spectra have the form

Inside the hyperboloids the expressions for wave function of plasmonic atoms and plas-

monic molecules are analogous to (19).

The axis-symmetrical (m = 0) spectra for several values of L, M =1, 3, 5, 10 are shown

in Fig. 11b as functions of distance between hyperbolic tips. The spatial distribution of

corresponding wavefunctions (electric potentials) for L, M =1 are given in Fig. 12.

As seen from the ﬁgures, for both the symmetrical and antisymmetrical plasmonic os-

cillations there is observed a strong localization of the modes, and this ensures an eﬀective

interaction with the ordinary atoms, molecules or quantum dots with plasmonic atoms and

molecules near the gap between tips. One more interesting fact is that the spectra of these

oscillations are quite close to the oscillations in a two-sphere cluster. This allows one to

consider the localized plasmonic oscillations in the gap between semi-inﬁnite bodies as the

virtual plasmonic atoms and molecules.

V. POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS OF PLASMONIC MOLECULES

Obviously, strong localization of plasmonic molecules may be suitable for a number of

applications. This is particularly important when one needs to ensure eﬀective interaction

between the nanolocalized light sources (molecules and nanocrystal quantum dots) and the

nanoparticles and nanostructures, as well as the nano-electromechanical devices [21], in

which the van der Waals forces play an important role [40, 41].

A. The eﬀect of the plasmonic molecules on the van der Waals forces (V.V.

Klimov, A. Lambrecht to be published)

As is well known, the van der Waals forces are associated with spatial dependence of the

vacuum ﬂuctuation energy density. If the distance between the plasmonic nanoparticles is

12

small, then the main contribution to the van der Waals energy comes from zero (vacuum)

oscillations of the plasmonic modes, i.e. the plasmonic atoms and molecules [42].

In case of two identical plasmonic nanospheres the contribution to the van der Waals

energy comes from zero oscillations of the antisymmetric and symmetric unbound plasmonic

atoms (L- and T-modes) and plasmonic molecules (M-modes)

(21)

In spite of the fact that the expressions for the van der Waals energy of diﬀerent modes

are formally similar, the noted contributions result in totally diﬀerent physical consequences.

Figure 6 shows that the energy of antisymmetric unbound states of the plasmonic atoms

grows with distance, and this results in the particle attraction. In a similar manner, the

energy of the plasmonic molecules diminishes with distance, and thus results in the repulsion

of the nanospheres. Symmetric states of unbound plasmonic atoms also lead to a very weak

repulsion.

The attraction or repulsion conditioned by diﬀerent plasmonic oscillations is of a simple

physical nature. First consider the axis-symmetrical oscillations (m = 0). Here the longitu-

dinal antisymmetric modes are conditioned by the oscillations of the parallel dipoles which

are attracting in accordance with the law of electrostatics (see Fig. 13 and Fig. 7). In case of

symmetrical oscillations the dipoles have opposite directions, and this results in the dipole

repulsion (see Fig. 13 and Fig. 7).

For m = 1, i.e. when the wave functions are described by the law of cos ϕ or sin ϕ (ϕ

is the angle describing the rotation around symmetry axis), the directions of the dipoles

corresponding to diﬀerent plasmonic states are changed. For antisymmetric modes the

dipole moments in diﬀerent spheres should be crosswise to the symmetry axis and should

have opposite orientations (Fig. 13 and Fig. 7). It is easily seen that this results again in

the eﬀect of attraction of the unbound plasmonic atoms. For the plasmonic molecules the

dipole momenta should also be crosswise to the symmetry axis, but, due to the symmetry

with respect to z coordinate, should have the same direction (see Fig. 13). This again leads

to the repulsion of nanospheres with plasmonic molecules.

Fig. 14 illustrates the dependence of the contributions from diﬀerent plasmonic states

into the van der Waals energy on the distance between the spheres. This was obtained

by direct summation of all the plasmonic modes in (21). As it was clear beforehand, the

symmetric modes lead to the repulsion, while the longitudinal antisymmetric modes lead to

the attraction of the nanoparticles. Unexpectedly, the repulsion contribution from plasmonic

molecules is almost equal to the attraction contribution of the unbound plasmonic atoms.

As a result, the total van der Waals energy grows with distance, i.e.

it is the attraction

energy, but the amount of this energy is by an order smaller than the energy to be obtained

without taking into account the contribution from the plasmonic molecules.

Direct measurement of the van der Waals force between the plasmonic nanoparticles may

form the basis of the experimental proof of the plasmonic molecule existence.

B. The eﬀect of plasmonic molecules on the emission of ordinary molecules and

quantum dots

Since the plasmonic molecules particularly eﬀectively interact with highly inhomogeneous

electric ﬁelds, then one can develop diﬀerent detectors of the ordinary single molecules or

quantum dots. Fig. 15 illustrates the dependence of the radiation decay rate of spontaneous

emission of diﬀerent molecules, which fall within the gap between the two spheres, on the

radiation wavelength. It is assumed that the nanospheres are made of Na with the plasmonic

resonances in the visible range (Fig. 15a) or SiC with the phonon-polariton resonances in

the IR range (Fig. 15b). The peaks in the right-hand part of the ﬁgures correspond to the

interaction of an ordinary molecule and the unbound plasmonic atoms, while the peaks in

the left-hand part correspond to the interaction with the plasmonic molecules.

The analysis of the ﬁgures shows that, similar to the case of the van der Waals energy, the

interaction with plasmonic molecules is of greater importance than that with the symmetric

unbound plasmonic atoms. Of fundamental importance is the fact that in a homogeneous

external ﬁeld the plasmonic molecules are not eﬀectively excited. This results in the follow-

ing: the clusters of two and more nanoparticles (where the geometry allows one to excite

the plasmonic molecules of a certain frequency), can be used in the development of eﬀective

14

nanodetectors of single molecules of high signal/noise ratio, since the external ﬁelds at the

plasmonic molecule frequency fail to excite the plasmonic molecule eﬀectively.

On the other hand, the eﬀective interaction between the plasmonic and ordinary atoms

and molecules can be applied both to the development of SPASER and single atom nanolaser,

and the sets of such devices.

C. Large cluster or inﬁnite array of nanoparticles

Probably, the most interesting consequence of the plasmonic molecule strong localization

near the gap between the nanoparticles of arbitrary shapes lies in possible existence of plas-

monic molecules in the clusters with more than two particles. Figure 16 illustrates a cluster

of nine metallic nanoparticles, in which diﬀerent conﬁgurations of plasmonic molecules may

exist. In each of the twelve gaps a plasmonic molecule having the properties deﬁned by the

curvature radii of the closest surfaces and given by expressions (9)-(11) may be excited. In

this system one can also excite the pairs, triples, quadruples, etc., of plasmonic molecules.

Under simultaneous excitation of several plasmonic molecules a weak interaction between

the molecules may be easily taken into account using the perturbation theory. The account

for such an interaction results in the hybridization of the wave functions of single plasmonic

molecules and a corresponding splitting of the spectrum. Similar reasoning is also fully appli-

cable to the large-size arrays of nanoparticles, and this allows one to speak about plasmonic

molecular crystals. In other words, a strong spatial localization of plasmonic molecules and

their weak interaction with each other allows an almost linear scaling of any simpler struc-

ture of plasmonic molecules. To put it in simpler words, the plasmonic molecules allow one,

similar to the Lego bricks, to produce the optoelectronic nanodevices of any complexity.

In principle, the excitation of plasmonic molecules in the clusters and arrays may be per-

formed with the help of homogeneous optical ﬁelds of a corresponding resonant frequency.

However, such a method of excitation is not highly eﬀective due to weak polarizability

of plasmonic molecules. A positive feature of such ineﬃciency is a weak sensitivity of plas-

monic molecules to the external noise ﬁelds. A more eﬀective method to excite the plasmonic

molecules lies in the excitation by means of spontaneous or stimulated radiation (SPASER

[12])of usual molecules at a frequency of plasmonic molecule oscillation . In this case, de-

pending on the orientation and location of the ordinary molecules ( or nanocrystal quantum

15

dots) with respect to the exciting ﬁeld, the plasmonic molecules may be produced in the

given part of a cluster or array, and, thus, to produce diﬀerent initial conditions for the data

processing and transfer.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this work the analysis has been made of the plasmonic oscillations in single nanoparti-

cles and the clusters of nanoparticles. It has been shown that all the plasmonic oscillations

may be classed by the degree of their localization. Such oscillations where the localization

is mostly deﬁned by the size of single nanoparticles we propose to name ”the plasmonic

atoms”, and those strongly localized in the nanoparticle contact zones (without electrical

contact) we propose to name ”the plasmonic molecules”, since they are the bound states

of plasmonic atoms. It has been demonstrated that the plasmonic molecules almost do not

interact between each other, and, so, can form the structures of arbitrary spatial complex-

ity. The methods of plasmonic molecule excitation and its applications in the description of

NEMS and the nanodetectors of single molecules are brieﬂy discussed as well.

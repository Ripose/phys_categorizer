A theoretical investigation on the phase control of optical transient four-wave mixing interactions
in two-level systems driven by two intense temporal coherent femtosecond laser pulses of central
angular frequencies ω and 3ω is reported. By solving the full Maxwell-Bloch equations beyond
the slowly-varying envelope and rotating-wave approximations in the time domain, the parametric
nonlinear coupling to the optical ﬁeld at frequency 5ω is found to depend critically on the initial
relative phase φ of the two propagating pulses; the coupling is enhanced when the pulses interfere
constructively in the center (φ = 0), while it is nearly suppressed when they are out of phase (φ = π).

In recent years, due to the developments in the engi-
neering of intense ultrashort laser ﬁelds with a well de-
ﬁned absolute phase [1], studies on the phase control of
the interaction of two-color strong ultrashort laser pulses
in nonlinear materials has become an area of active re-
search [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Phenomena arising from such
ultrashort pulse interaction can be of extreme impor-
tance in ﬁelds as diverse as optoelectronics and materials
research, in biological applications such as spectroscopy
and microscopy, in high harmonic generation, and in pho-
toionization or molecular dissociation, among others.

It is known that when the pulses duration approach the
duration of only several optical cycles, theories based on
the slowly-varying envelope approximation (SVEA) and
the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) are not longer
appropriate, since phenomena such as electric ﬁeld time-
derivatives leading to carrier-wave reshaping [8], or the
generation of high spectral components [9], can not be
described by such theories. In these situations, accurate
numerical modeling based on the ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-
domain (FDTD) method [10] is being increasingly used to
investigate the full set of optical Maxwell-Bloch equations
[7, 8, 9, 11].

In this Letter, we investigate the possibilities of phase
control of transient four-wave mixing interactions in two-
level systems driven by two mutually coherent intense ul-
trashort pulses of central angular frequencies ω and 3ω.
We employ a standard predictor-corrector FDTD numer-
ical approach which incorporates all propagation eﬀects
–such as nonlinearity, dispersion, absorption, dissipation,
saturation, and other resonance eﬀects– [8], to study the
sensitivity on the relative phase φ of the nonlinear cou-
pling of the ω-3ω pulses to the ﬁeld at frequency 5ω,
which results from the interaction of the waves through
the third order susceptibility of the medium (χ(3)) [12].
By describing the evolution of the ﬁeld spectrum as
the two-color pulses propagate through the medium, our
simulations demonstrate that the generation of the 5ω-
component is enhanced when the two pulses are in phase
(φ = 0), while it is nearly suppressed when they are out
of phase (φ = π). We have analyzed the eﬀect in two
diﬀerent conﬁgurations:
– First, we have considered the propagation of two pulses

FIG. 1: Schematic energy level diagram. The four-wave mix-
ing can occur between the injected two-color ﬁelds at frequen-
cies ω and 3ω, and a third generated ﬁeld at frequency 5ω.
The wavelengths associated to the frequencies in this scheme
are: λ(ω) = 2400 nm; λ(3ω) = 800 nm; λ(5ω) = 480 nm;
λ(ω12) = 400 nm. The area of the pulses is A = 20π.

[13] and wavelengths as λ(ω) = 2400 nm and λ(3ω) = 800
nm, respectively. By four-wave mixing (see Fig. 1) the
ﬁelds can interact with a generated third wave which has

we have considered a large detuning between the ﬁelds
and the atomic transition resonance, which corresponds
to λ(ω12) = 2πc/ω12 = 400 nm.
– In a second study, we have considered two pulses of
10 fs with a pulse area as A = 4π. The wavelengths
are λ(ω) = 1743 nm and λ(3ω) = 581 nm, respectively.
By the nonlinear third order coupling (see Fig. 3) the
ﬁelds can produce a wave at λ(5ω) = 348.6 nm. The ﬁeld
with λ(3ω) nm is in this case almost in resonance with the
atomic transition (λ(ω12) = 580 nm). This last transition
might be relevant for biological applications, and it is
being a subject of investigation with techniques such as
femtosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (fs-
CARS) [14].

Γ = 2.65e˚A, and Nat = 2 × 1018 cm−3.

is externally injected to the system. The peak input
electric ﬁeld amplitude E0 is chosen the same for both
pulses and, in terms of the pulse area A, it is given by
E0 = A~/(πΓtp) [13]. The duration of the pulse is given
by tp = τp/1.763, with τp being the full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of the pulse intensity envelope. t0
gives the oﬀset position of the pulse center at t = 0, and
it is the time reference value for the absolute phase of
the pulses. The angular frequencies of the pulses are ω
and 3ω, and φ is the relative phase. It is important to
note that our simulations give information on the coher-
ent (transient) behavior of the system, since the dephas-
ing time is chosen much larger than the duration of the
pulses T1, T2 >> τp.

In Fig. 2 we show the results of the simulations cor-
responding to the ﬁrst scheme that we have analyzed.
We represent the spectrum of the pulse in diﬀerent po-
sitions of the propagation. The calculations have been
performed for propagation distances as long as z=200
µm. The two higher peaks on the left of each spectra,
in Fig. 2, correspond to the two initial frequencies in-
jected in the medium. When the two initial pulses are
in phase (φ = 0), a third frequency component is gen-
erated at 5ω = 3ω + (3ω − ω), as shown in Fig. 2(a).
It is clear in that case that the conversion of the third
harmonic 3ω component to the 5ω increases as the propa-
gation length increases. In the opposite case (Fig. 2(b)),
however, when the two pulses are initially out of phase
(φ = π), the conversion to the 5ω component is com-
pletely suppressed. This contrasting behavior, which de-

pends only on the initial relative phase between the two
injected pulses, is certainly intriguing and to the best of
our knowledge has not been observed before. The rea-
son of this eﬀect stems from the phase dependence of
the quantum interferences in the medium, which strongly
depend on the carrier-shape of the pulses in the case of
intense ﬁelds, since the interaction in that case is gov-
erned by the electric ﬁeld itself rather than with its enve-
lope [9]. It is also worth mentioning that our calculations
show in both cases (φ = 0, π) how, for longer propagation
distances (z > 200mu m), the result of the interference
of the pulses together with carrier-wave Rabi ﬂopping
phenomena lead to the generation of high spectral com-
ponents [9], which in the case of the present parameter
values spread over the entire UV region [15].

Figure 3 shows the second energy level conﬁguration
that we have analyzed. Two overlapping pulses with a
duration of τp = 10 fs are injected in the two-level sys-
tem. The area of the pulses in that case is much smaller
(A = 4π) than in the previous scheme. The ﬁeld at fre-
quency 3ω is nearly in resonance with the transition of
the medium. In Fig. 4 the ﬁeld spectra for two diﬀerent
positions in the propagation of the pulses (z = 50 µm (a)
and z = 300 µm (b)) is shown. Although many details of
the spectra obtained in this conﬁguration has been inves-
tigated in previous work [7], we are here concerned with

FIG. 3: Energy level scheme corresponding to our second
study. As in the previous scheme (1), the coupling can occur
between the ﬁelds injected at frequencies ω and 3ω, and a
third ﬁeld generated at 5ω. The wavelengths associated to the
frequencies in this scheme are: λ(ω) = 1743 nm; λ(3ω) = 581
nm; λ(5ω) = 348.6 nm; λ(ω12) = 580 nm. The area of the
pulses is A = 4π. Note that, in this case, the transition ω12
is close to resonance with the ﬁeld at 3ω.

the inﬂuence of the relative phase on the parametric non-
linear coupling to the optical ﬁeld at frequency 5ω. As
another manifestation of the phenomenon that we are re-
porting, we observe in this conﬁguration again that the
transfer of energy to the 5ω-component (which peak is
marked by an arrow in Fig. 4) is only eﬃcient in the
case of constructive central pulses interference (φ = 0),
while it is almost suppressed for (φ = π).
It is worth
noting that the rest of the main peaks in the spectra,
which result from the interference of the ﬁelds, are basi-
cally insensitive to the variations of φ. This stresses the
fact that is the four-wave mixing coupling that is mostly
inﬂuenced by φ. This second example, where one of the
interfering ﬁelds is near to resonance with the medium,
demonstrates the generality of this phase control phe-
nomenon, in the sense that it has been observed in both
non-resonant and resonant four-wave mixing conﬁgura-
tions.

As a conclusion, we have analyzed the coherent prop-
agation of two-color (ω-3ω) femtosecond (broad-band)
laser pulses overlapping in time and propagating in a two-
level system to an extend of some hundreds of microns.
Our simulations predict a critical dependence on the rel-
ative initial phase for the transfer of energy through four-
wave mixing to the ﬁeld at frequency 5ω. We have ob-
served this phenomenon in the case of highly intense fem-
tosecond pulses strongly detuned from the transition in
the medium and for less intense pulses nearly in reso-
nance with the material transition, and hence the eﬀect
can be considered as being a general eﬀect, provided the
conditions detailed above are fulﬁlled and the intensity
of the pulses is high enough to excite the third order non-
linearity of the material. The frequencies chosen in our
study lie in the infrared and visible domains, and hence
the observations reported here can be useful for optoelec-
tronics and biological applications.

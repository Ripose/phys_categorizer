Superluminal behavior has been extensively studied in recent years, especially with regard to the
topic of superluminality in the propagation of a signal. Particular interest has been devoted to Bessel-
X waves propagation, since some experimental results showed that these waves have both phase and
group velocities greater that light velocity c. However, because of the lack of an exact deﬁnition of
signal velocity, no deﬁnite answer about the signal propagation (or velocity of information) has been
found. The present paper is a short note that deals in a general way with this vexed question. By
analyzing the ﬁeld of existence of the Bessel X-wave in pseudo-Euclidean space-time, it is possible
to give a general description of the propagation, and to overcome the speciﬁc question related to a
deﬁnition of signal velocity.

The propagation of a Bessel-X wave (or Bessel beam) is of great interest in physics. This interest is due to the
unusual features which characterize these waves: they are non-diﬀracting [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and show superluminal
behaviour in both phase and group velocities [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Because of these two characteristics, the interest
that has arisen with regard to Bessel-X waves has led to several theoretical and experimental investigations, none of
which has as yet been able to provide deﬁnite information on signal velocity.

For propagation in vacuum (or air), the scalar ﬁeld of a Bessel-X wave propagating along the z-axis of a cylindrical

coordinate system (ρ, ψ, z) is given by:

u(ρ, ψ, z) = AJ0(k0ρ sin θ0) exp(ik0z cos θ0) exp(−iωt) ,

where A is an amplitude factor, θ0 is the parameter which characterizes the aperture of the beam (Axicon angle), and
k0 is the wavenumber in the vacuum. Function J0 denotes the zero-order Bessel function of ﬁrst kind, which, apart
from inessential factors, can be written as [14]

The beam is rotationally symmetric and is thus independent of the angular coordinate ψ. Equation (1) is obtained
from the superposition of inﬁnite plane waves of the same amplitude, each propagating in a diﬀerent direction and
forming the same angle θ0 with the z-axis.

In looking at Eq. (1), we note that the dependence on t and z occurs only through the quantity

and, therefore, the beam (1) takes the same value after a time, dt, equal to (dz/c) cos θ0: that is, it propagates with
a velocity

greater than c. It is well-known that, in the presence of anomalous dispersion, group velocity can largely overcome
the speed of light in vacuum, and can even become negative. In the absence of dispersion, the situation is diﬀerent,
since the three velocities which characterize the propagation (phase, group, and signal velocities) tend to coincide.
This statement is valid not only for waves, but also for pulses, since all components at diﬀerent frequencies propagate
with the same velocity. In fact, in the absence of dispersion the pulse does not suﬀer “reshaping”, a process that is
always present in dispersive systems. Moreover, if we insert a spectral function (depending only on the frequency) in
(1), this presence does not modify the situation and the previous conclusion is found to be true also for a pulse.

Let us now analyze the propagation of a signal.
According to Brillouin [15], a signal can be deﬁned as a pulse of ﬁnite temporal extension, that is, of an inﬁnite
extension in the frequency domain. Thus, we can “construct” a signal U (ρ, z, t) by superimposing a set of Bessel

beam velocity for a given axicon angle, θ0. For θ0 = 0, the beam is reduced to a plane wave, and its velocity then becomes
equal to c. In this situation, the ﬁeld of existence of the beam goes to zero, the Super-Light Cone narrows and becomes equal
to the Light-Cone.

Since the Bessel pulse propagates along the z-axis (see Eq. (1)), we have that the propagation of the beam in the
z − t plane is within a conical surface (see Fig. 2) similar to the Light Cone, where light velocity c is replaced by
velocity vb = c/ cos θ0, and t is a real quantity: we can say that the propagation of a Bessel pulse in the Euclidean-space
corresponds to a Super-Light Cone in the pseudo-Euclidean space-time of Minkowski. In other words, by introducing
a second spatial coordinate, for a given value of θ0, we obtain a Super-Light Cone like the one of Fig. 3, where straight
line vb, which depends on θ0, is the beam velocity.

For θ0 = θmax, vb represents the border line which determines the existence of the ﬁeld: the Bessel beam exists only
in the blue zone. Inside this cone of existence, the past Super-Light Cone, t < 0, represents the time interval prior
to generation of the beam. The beam originates at t = 0, and for t > 0 (future Super-Light Cone) propagates along
the z axis with velocity vb (yellow line, in Fig. 3). For θ0 = 0 the beam reduces to a plane wave, its velocity becomes
equal to c (orange line, in Fig. 3), and the Super-Light Cone becomes the Light Cone (orange cone in Fig. 3).

Since Bessel beams have been experimentally generated and measured, there is no doubt that they are real quantities.
Moreover, since Eq. (1) is capable of describing the scalar ﬁeld of the beam as being due to a speciﬁc experimental
set-up [16], we can conclude that the Super-Light Cone places a new upper speed limit for all objects. Massless
particles can travel not only along the Light Cone, but also along the Super-Light Cone in the region between the
Super-Cone and the Cone, while the world-lines remain conﬁned within the Light-Cone. In substance, we can think
that c is the velocity of light in its simplest manifestation (wave), while more complex electromagnetic phenomena,
such as the interference among an inﬁnite number of waves, may originate diﬀerent velocities. The maximum value
θmax of axicon angle θ0 sets the maximum value of the beam velocity. Since the ﬁled depth, that is, the spatial range
−1
in which the beam exists, is proportional to tan θ
0 , θ0 can never reach the value of π/2. If it were possible to obtain
values of θ0 close to π/2, we should have almost immediate propagation in a nearly-zero space, rather like an ultra
fast shot destined to slow down immediately.

The change in the upper limit of the light velocity (the Bessel beam is “light”) does not modify the fundamental
principles of relativity and the principle of causality, as demonstrated by recent theory dealing with new geometrical
structure of space-time [17]. The principle that “the speed of light is the same for all inertial observers, regardless of
the motion of the source”, remains unchanged, provided that the substitution c −→ vb (= c/ cos θ0) is made in the
Lorentz transformations. In this way, the direction of the beam-light does not depend on the motion of the source,
and all observers measure the same speed (vb) in all directions, independently of their motions.

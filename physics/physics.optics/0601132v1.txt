Restructuring

We present an experimental spectroscopic study of large random colloidal aggregates of silver
nanoparticles undergoing local restructuring. We argue that such well-known phenomena as strong
ﬂuctuation of local electromagnetic ﬁelds, appearance of “hot spots” and enhancement of nonlinear
optical responses depend on the local structure on the scales of several nanosphere diameters, rather
that the large-scale fractal geometry of the sample.

Physical properties of surface plasmons (SPs) in disor-
dered nanosystems have been the subject of intense stud-
ies in the past decade [1, 2, 3, 4]. The two objects that
attracted most attention are disordered two-component
composites [5, 6, 7], including two-dimensional percola-
tion ﬁlms [8], and aggregates of nanometer-sized noble
metal spheres formed in colloidal solutions (colloidal ag-
gregates) [9]. The latter are subject of this paper. Opti-
cal and, more generally, electromagnetic eﬀects that were
discovered in colloidal aggregates include giant enhance-
ment of nonlinear-optical responses [9, 10], inhomoge-
neous localization of electromagnetic eigenmodes [11, 12],
and optical memory [13, 14].

Perhaps, the most fundamental physical feature of elec-
tromagnetic interaction in colloid aggregates is inhomo-
geneous broadening [15]. That is, diﬀerent electromag-
netic modes that can be excited in such aggregates (col-
lective SP excitations) are resonant at diﬀerent wave-
lengths which form a continuous band extending from
the optical to the far-IR spectral region [16, 17]. In con-
trast, a single isolated silver nanosphere has a well deﬁned
narrow resonance centered at approximately λ = 400nm
(in hydrosols) [1]. The spectral shifts of the collective SP
excitations are explained by the electromagnetic interac-
tion of nanospheres. We view such excitations as col-
lective even though not all nanospheres may eﬀectively
participate in a particular excitation modes. In fact, it
was shown, that at any given electromagnetic frequency,
there exist SP excitation which are delocalized over the
whole sample, as well as excitations localized on a few
neighboring nanospheres (hot spots) [11, 12]. It was also
shown, both experimentally and in simulations, that the
locations of these hot spots are very sensitive to the elec-
tromagnetic frequency and polarization of the incident
wave [18].

The spatial properties of the collective SP excitations
in random colloidal aggregates have been studied in great
detail (see Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4] and references therein). How-
ever, little is known about the relation between the sam-

ple geometry and spatial properties of electromagnetic
eigenmodes. Typically, the eigenmodes are obtained
as solutions to the electromagnetic interaction problem.
More speciﬁcally, an inﬁnite matrix representing the elec-
tromagnetic interaction operator is truncated and diag-
onalized numerically [19]. Each element of this matrix
is completely deﬁned by the sample geometry. In prin-
ciple, the same is also true for the eigenmodes. How-
ever, the mathematical dependence between elements of
a large matrix and its eigenvectors can be very complex
and, in the general case, not easily analyzable. Some ap-
proximate theories that directly relate the spatial char-
acteristics of the sample and the electromagnetic ﬁeld
excited in the sample were based on the ﬁrst Born [20]
and mean-ﬁeld [21] approximations, on few-body inter-
action approximation (binary [15] or binary-ternary [12]
approximations), and various phenomenological scaling
laws [15, 22, 23]. However, the ﬁrst Born and the mean-
ﬁeld approximations are not applicable to resonant exci-
tation of collective SPs. The few-body approximations
and the scaling laws proved to be very useful for qualita-
tive theoretical description at the early stages of research,
but increasingly more realistic simulations revealed that
these approaches do not provide quantitative results.

We have recently argued that the locations of “hot
spots” in random fractal aggregates are strongly corre-
lated with the local anisotropy factor [24] which quan-
tiﬁes the deviation of the local environment of a given
nanosphere in an aggregate from the spherical symmetry.
We have shown in simulations that sites with high local
anisotropy are likely to coincide with the “hot spots”.
This concept allows one to make a qualitative prediction
about location of the “hot spots” in a large aggregate
without actually solving the electromagnetic problem. In
this paper we present experimental evidence of this con-
jecture.

Direct measurements of local ﬁelds near the surface
of aggregates deposited on a ﬂat substrate is possible
with near-ﬁeld scanning optical microscopy [18], while

the geometrical structure can be probed with atomic-
force microscopy or electron microscopy. However, these
methods only yield two-dimensional images and are not
suitable for investigating three-dimensional structure of
sample or of the ﬁeld. Therefore, direct measurement of
the local anisotropy factor in three-dimensional samples
is a diﬃcult experimental task. (We note that this can
be achieved, in principle, by solving the inverse scatter-
ing problem in the near ﬁeld [25].) However, it is pos-
sible to observe the inﬂuence of local restructuring on
the electromagnetic properties of a large aggregate indi-
rectly by studying IR absorption of large nanoaggregates
as they undergo local restructuring. The enhancement
of IR absorption in an aggregate relative to an isolated
nanosphere is an important eﬀect explained by the in-
homogeneous broadening, or spectral shifts of resonance
eigenmodes from the Fr¨ohlich frequency of an isolated
nanosphere into the IR region. The inhomogeneous spec-
tral broadening is a direct consequence of strong reso-
nance interaction of diﬀerent nanospheres in an aggregate
and re To this end, we have studied extinction spectra
of silver fractal aggregates embedded in a polymer ma-
trix under uniform contraction. We have studied how the
long wavelength wings of the absorption spectra evolve
due to the contraction.

Experimental samples were prepared as follows. First,
silver hydrosol was prepared by reduction of AgNO3 by
NaBH4 in water solution [9] (electrolyte concentration
2.5 · 10−3 M). After this chemical reaction, the hydrosol
is a colloidal solution of silver nanospheres 10nm to 40nm
in diameter that undergo random Brownian motion and
can stick on contact and form large fractal aggregates.
The aggregation process was accelerated by irradiation
of the hydrosol with the natural light for 4 − 10min [26].
The overall size of aggregates was of the order of 1µm or
larger as follows from TEM images. Next, the hydrosol
containing aggregates of silver nanospheres was added
into a water solution of gelatin. The volume fraction of
silver in the resultant solution was ∼ 10−6. Next, the
prepared solution was allowed to gelate. As a result,
the metal nanoparticles became rigidly connected to the
polymer matrix of the gel and could not move freely. We
have prepared rectangular gelatin samples with initial
dimensions of 1 × 5 × 10cm3. At the next stage, the gel
underwent gradual dehydration and the sample volume
was reduced by the factor of ≈ 10. This corresponds to
linear contraction by the factor of ≈ 2.15.

Electron micrographs of Ag nanoaggregates in the
hydrosol and in thin slices of the gel (several hundreds
nm thick) taken after the dehydration are shown in
Fig. 1.
It can be seen that, as the gelatin matrix
undergoes contraction, the local geometrical structure of
the aggregates changes. Neighboring nanospheres tend
to form dense blobs which are spherically symmetric
on average. Inside such blob, the local environment of
a nanosphere is more similar to that in chaotic dense
packing. Therefore, we expect that the local asymmetry
factor is reduced in the restructured aggregates.

nanoaggregates before their embedding into the gelatin
matrix (a, b) and in slices of the gel in the ﬁnal stage of the
dehydratation (c, d). The slice thickness is approximately
200-300 nm (c) and 500-700 nm (d). Low resolution in
image (d) is explained by the relatively large slice thickness.
Nanoaggregates shown in the left and right columns are not
the same.

We have also simulated the restructuring process on
a computer.
Initially, a random two-dimensional (2D)
aggregate with N = 700 nanospheres and fractal dimen-
sion D ≈ 1.46 and a three-dimensional (3D) aggregate
with N = 2000 nanospheres and fractal dimention
D ≈ 1.83 were generated using the method described in
Ref. [19]. Then the coordinates of each nanosphere were
repeatedly multiplied by the factor 0.95, while the sphere
radii were kept constant. The contraction resulted in
geometrical intersection of neighboring spheres. Then
each sphere (in a predetermined order) was moved to the
nearest possible position as to avoid its intersection with
any other sphere in the aggregate. Next the contraction
by the factor 0.95 was repeated, and so on, until the
overall linear contraction of the sample by the factor
≈ 2.5 was achieved (approximately, in 50 iterations).
The stages of transformation of the aggregate are shown
in Fig. 2. The local restructuring similar to the one
seen in TEM images is clearly visible. However, the
global geometrical
remains
approximately unchanged, within the limits imposed by
the changing overall size of the aggregate. Note that
the the changes of local structure in 3D aggregates are

structure of aggregates

partially obscured by the overlaps in 2D projection of a
3D object. This problem is not present in the case of
2D aggregates, which are shown in Fig. 2 for illustrative
purpose.

matrix is close to that of non-aggregated nanospheres
in solution. This indicates that all the eﬀects related to
inhomogeneous broadening, such as the giant local ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations, appearance of “hot spots” and enhance-
ment of nonlinear responses are strongly suppressed in
the aggregates that underwent local restructuring. The
spectral changes have been reproduced in a series of ﬁve
independent experiments.

3D fractal aggregates embedded in a contracting gelatin
matrix. Original 2D and 3D aggregates (a,d) after linear
contraction by the factor ∼ 1.4 (b,e) and ∼ 2.5 (c,f). For
the 3D aggregate, the average value of the local anisotropy
parameter S deﬁned in Ref. [24] are 1.03 (d), 0.94 (e) and
0.74 (f).

The evolution of the absorption spectra of the samples
as they undergo gradual contraction are shown in Fig. 3.
Here the solid bold line (line 1) represents the absorption
spectrum of silver hydrosol before aggregation, the solid
thin line (line 2) the spectrum after aggregation and
before embedding in the gelatin matrix. Dashed lines
3-5 describe diﬀerent stages of dehydration of the
matrix. These curves correspond to the absorption of
silver aggregates; the absorption of pure gelatin was
subtracted from the composite samples. It can be seen
that, as the aggregates undergo restructuring due to the
matrix contraction, the long wavelength spectral wing is
suppressed. In particular, the absorption at λ ≈ 800nm
in the dehydrated gelatin matrix (curve 5) is reduced
approximately by the factor of 2 compared to that in
the original gelatin matrix (curve 3) and by the factor
of 3 compared to aggregates in solution. We note that
at that wavelength, the absorption in the dehydrated

aggregated stage (1) and in the ﬁnal stage of aggregation
(2), and of silver aggregates embedded in the gelatin matrix
in diﬀerent stages of dehydration of gelatin (3-5). Curves
3-5 show diﬀerential absorption spectra: the absorption of
identical gelatin matrix without silver aggregates was sub-
tracted. Absorpotion spectra are shown at the initial stage of
freshly prepared matrix (curve 3), at the intermediate stage
of dehydration (curve 4) and after full dehydration (curve 5).
Curves 2-5 are normalized to common maximum.

In summary, we have provided experimental evidence
that the local anisotropy of the environment introduced
in Ref. [24], rather than the large-scale geometrical struc-
ture, is the crucial factor for ﬂuctuation and enhancement
of local ﬁelds in random aggregates of nanospheres.

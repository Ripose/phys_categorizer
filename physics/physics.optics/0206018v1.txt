Boundary element method for resonances in dielectric microcavities

Jan Wiersig
Max-Planck-Institut f¨ur Physik komplexer Systeme, D-01187 Dresden, Germany∗
(Dated: October 23, 2012)

A boundary element method based on a Green’s function technique is introduced to compute res-
onances with intermediate lifetimes in quasi-two-dimensional dielectric cavities. It can be applied
to single or several optical resonators of arbitrary shape, including corners, for both TM and TE
polarization. For cavities with symmetries a symmetry reduction is described. The existence of spu-
rious solutions is discussed. The eﬃciency of the method is demonstrated by calculating resonances
in two coupled hexagonal cavities.

INTRODUCTION

Dielectric cavities have recently attracted considerable
attention due to the fabrication of microlasers [1, 2].
Various shapes have been studied both experimentally
and theoretically: deformed spheres [3, 4, 5], deformed
disks [1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], squares [13] and
hexagons [14, 15]. An eﬃcient numerical strategy to
compute optical properties of eﬀectively two-dimensional
dielectric cavities with more complex geometries is the
subject of the present paper.

Maxwell’s equations simplify to a two-dimensional (re-

duced) wave equation [16]

2ψ = n2(r)k2ψ ,

− ∇

(1)

with coordinates r = (x, y) = (r cos θ, r sin θ), piece-wise
constant index of refraction n(r), (vacuum) wave num-
ber k = ω/c, angular frequency ω and speed of light in
vacuum c. In the case of TM polarization, the complex-
valued wave function ψ represents the z-component of
the electric ﬁeld vector Ez(r, t) = ψ(r) exp (
iωt) with
i2 =
1, whereas for TE polarization, ψ represents the
z-component of the magnetic ﬁeld vector Hz.

The boundary conditions at inﬁnity are determined by
the experimental situation.
In a scattering experiment
the wave function is composed of an incoming plane wave
with wave vector k and an outgoing scattered wave. The
wave function has the asymptotic form (in 2D)

ψin + ψout = exp (ikr) + f (θ, k)

and f (θ, k) is the angle-dependent diﬀer-
where k =
ential amplitude for elastic scattering. In lasers, however,
the radiation is generated within the cavity without in-
coming wave,

This situation can be modelled by a dielectric cavity with
complex-valued n leading to steady-state solutions of the
wave equation (1). Alternatively, one can use real-valued
n leading to states that are exponentially decaying in
time. The lifetime τ of these so-called resonant states or
short resonances is given by the imaginary part of the
wave number as τ =
1/2c Im(k) with Im(k) < 0. τ is
related to the quality factor Q = Re(ω)τ . The resonant
states are connected to the peak structure in scattering
spectra; see [17] for an introduction. Resonant states
have been introduced by Gamow [18] and by Kapur and
Peirles [19].

−

The wave equation (1) with the outgoing-wave condi-
tion (3) can be solved analytically by means of separation
of variables only for special geometries, like the isolated
circular cavity (see e.g. Ref. [20]) and the symmetric
annular cavity [10]. In general, numerical methods are
needed. Frequently used are wave-matching methods [6].
The wave function is usually expanded in integer Bessel
functions inside the cavity and in Hankel functions of ﬁrst
kind outside, so that the outgoing-wave condition (3) is
fulﬁlled automatically. The Rayleigh hypothesis asserts
that such an expansion is always possible. However, it
can fail for geometries which are not suﬃciently small
deformations of a circular cavity [21].

More ﬂexible are, for example, ﬁnite-diﬀerence meth-
ods; see e.g. [22]. These methods involve a discretization
of the two-dimensional space, which is a heavy numeri-
cal task for highly-excited states. An even more severe
restriction is that it is impossible to discretize to inﬁn-
ity. One has to select a cut-oﬀ at some arbitrary distance
from the cavities and implement there the outgoing-wave
condition (3). For these reasons, ﬁnite-diﬀerence meth-
ods are not suitable for computing resonances in dielec-
tric cavities.

A class of ﬂexible methods with better numerical eﬃ-
ciency are boundary element methods (BEMs). The cen-
tral idea is to replace two-dimensional diﬀerential equa-
tions such as Eq. (1) by one-dimensional boundary inte-
gral equations (BIEs) and then to discretize the bound-
aries. BEMs have been widely applied to geometries
with Dirichlet boundary conditions (wave function van-
ishes), Neumann boundary conditions (normal deriva-
tive vanishes) and combinations of them [22, 23, 24, 25].

Bounded states have been calculated in the context of
quantum chaos; for an introduction see Refs. [26, 27].
For scattering problems consider, for example, Ref. [28].
Resonances have been computed for scattering at three
disks by Gaspard and Rice [29].

The boundary conditions for dielectric cavities, how-
ever, are of a diﬀerent kind: the wave function and its
(weighted) normal derivative are continuous across a cav-
ity boundary. An analogous quantum problem in semi-
conductor nanostructures has been treated by Knipp and
Reinecke [30]. Their BEM is for bounded and scattering
states only. The aim of the present paper is to extend
their approach to resonances in dielectric cavities for TM
and TE polarization, including a discussion of spurious
solutions, treatment of cavities with symmetries and cav-
ities with corners.

The paper is organized as follows. The BIEs are de-
rived in the framework of the Green’s function technique
in Sec. II. Section III describes the BEM. Section IV
demonstrates the eﬃciency of the method with an exam-
ple of two coupled hexagonal resonators. Finally, Sec. V
contains a summary.

II. BOUNDARY INTEGRAL EQUATIONS

In this section we derive the BIEs for the general case

As illustrated in Fig. 1, the space is divided into J re-
gions Ωj, j = 1, 2, . . . , J, in each of which the index of
refraction n(r) = nj is uniform. Without loss of general-
ity nJ is set to unity, i.e. the environment is vacuum or
air. We ﬁrst concentrate on TM polarization where both
the wave function ψ and its normal derivative are contin-
uous across an interface separating two diﬀerent regions.

wave function and its normal derivative (weighted with
the inverse of the eﬀective mass m) are continuous at do-
main boundaries. If E < VJ then the state is bounded,
the wave function and its gradient vanish exponentially
as r
. Moreover, with Im(k) = 0 the Green’s func-
tion (5) vanishes as either r or r′ goes to inﬁnity. As a re-
sult Γ∞ does not contribute to any of the BIEs. Note that

Eq. (14) with identical ψ, φ (which are continuous across
the boundary) but diﬀerent Bj, Cj.

The scattering states in the related quantum problem
have been discussed again by Knipp and Reinecke [30].
In contrast to the case of bounded states, their results
also apply to dielectric cavities.

In region ΩJ the wave function has the asymptotic
form as in Eq. (2). The incoming wave ψin satisﬁes
Eq. (1). Thus, ψ can be replaced by ψ

however, is diﬀerent as we shall see in greater detail in

We now turn to the BIEs for resonances. Comparing
the scattering boundary condition (2) and the outgoing-
wave condition (3) indicates that we possibly can use the
scattering approach neglecting the incoming wave, that
is Eq. (17) with M0 = 0. Apart from the fact that k is
now a complex number, this is then identical to Eq. (14)
for bounded states. There is, however, one problem. The
circle at inﬁnity, Γ∞, may give a nonvanishing contribu-

the wave function (3) nor the Green’s function (5) van-
ish at inﬁnity. Gaspard and Rice [29] have shown for a
Dirichlet scattering problem that nonetheless I∞(r′) = 0
if r′ is at one of the scatterers’ boundaries or if r′ is
at a large distance from these boundaries. We have to
extend their result because (i) the problem of dielectric
cavities involves a diﬀerent kind of boundary conditions;
(ii) we are interested in the wave function ψ(r′) also in
the near-ﬁeld. We start with recalling that the circle at
inﬁnity, Γ∞, is deﬁned by r = const with r

Equation (23) has

Eq. (21) in an antisymmetric way it follows I∞(r′) = 0

compute the corresponding wave functions in the entire
domain.

Having established that the resonances are solutions
of the BIEs (14) with complex-valued k, we now demon-
strate that the BIEs (14) posses additional solutions
which do not fulﬁl the outgoing-wave condition (3). We
study this in an elementary way for a single cavity of ar-
bitrary shape. Outside this cavity suﬃciently far away
from its boundary, a solution of wave equation (1) can

with Hankel functions of ﬁrst and second kind [31] and
m and α(2)
with unknown complex-valued parameters α(1)
m .
Without boundary conditions at inﬁnity, solutions as in
Eq. (25) exist for all values of k. Boundary conditions
that ﬁx all parameters α(2)
m give rise to a discrete spec-
trum of k; for instance, the outgoing-wave condition (3)
requires α(2)
m = 0 for all m. Inserting the expansion (25)

Hence, I∞(r′) vanishes identically for all r′
only in the case of a resonance, where α(2)

ΓJ
m = 0 for all m.
However, the circle at inﬁnity does not contribute to
the BIEs (14) already if the weaker condition I∞(r′) = 0
for r′
ΓJ is satisﬁed. We insert this condition into the
l.h.s. of Eq. (26) and note that the r.h.s. is an expansion
of a solution of wave equation (1) inside the cavity with
“wrong” index of refraction n = nJ = 1. The result is
that the BIEs (14) possess undesired solutions, namely
bounded states of an interior Dirichlet problem, in addi-
tion to the resonances. As one consequence, the solutions
of the scattering BIEs (17) are not unique whenever k is
a solution of the interior Dirichlet problem. Note that
this nonuniqueness has not been discussed by Knipp and
Reinecke [30].

A related problem is known for cases with Dirichlet or
Neumann conditions; see, e.g., Refs. [22, 24]. There have
been several attempts to modify the BIEs in order to get
rid of these “spurious solutions”. Some of these modi-
ﬁcations could be applied to the present case, but this
would result in singular integrals which are hard to deal
with numerically. Fortunately, the spurious solutions are
not a severe problem for our purpose. We can distinguish
them, in principle, from the resonances in which we are
interested in. The former have Im(k) = 0 whereas the
latter have Im(k) < 0.

D. TE polarization

In the case of TE polarization, Eq. (1) is valid with ψ
representing the magnetic ﬁeld Hz. The wave function
ψ is continuous across the boundaries, but its normal
derivative is not, in contrast to the case of TM polariza-
tion. Instead, n(r)−2∂νψ is continuous [16].

This new boundary condition can be easily incorpo-
rated in the BEM by deﬁning φ = n−2∂νψ, B(s′, s) =
2G(s, s′; k)n2 and φin accordingly in equations like
−
Eqs. (13) and (16). We remark that the spurious so-
lutions are not aﬀected by this change of boundary con-
ditions.

Many dielectric cavities studied in the literature pos-
sess discrete symmetries. For example, the elliptical cav-
ity in Fig. 2 is symmetric with respect to the x and y
axes. In such a case, the wave functions can be divided

For systems with symmetries the BIEs can be reduced
to a fundamental domain if a modiﬁed Green’s function
is used. This decreases the numerical eﬀort considerably.
Let us restrict our discussion to the case in Eqs. (27) and
(28); other symmetries can be treated in a similar way.

The scattering problem as formulated in Sec. II B does
not allow the symmetry reduction because the incom-
ing plane wave in general destroys the symmetry; φin
and ψin in Eq. (17) do not fulﬁl the conditions (27) and
(28). There are certain incoming directions which do not
spoil the symmetry, but using only these special direc-
tions is dangerous because possibly not all resonances
are excited. A better approach is to consider a diﬀerent
physical situation illustrated in Fig. 2. Four plane waves

The most convenient numerical strategy for solving
BIEs as in Eqs. (13) and (16) is the BEM. The boundary
is discretized by dividing it into small boundary elements.
Along such an element, the wave function and its normal
derivative are considered as being constant (for linear,
quadratic, and cubic variations see, e.g., Refs. [24, 25]).

In the same way the scattering problem is approximated

by an equation as in Eq. (17) with M0 being a 2N
matrix, φin and ψin being N -component vectors.

In the literature several levels of approximation are
used for the matrix elements Bil and Cil. The crudest
approximation is to evaluate such an integral only at the
corresponding midpoint sl. While this is suﬃcient for the
calculation of bounded states in quantum billiards [27],
in our case the small imaginary parts of k require a more
accurate treatment. We therefore do perform the numer-
ical integration of the matrix elements Bil and Cil, using
standard integration routines like, for example, Gaussian
quadratures [32]. The number of interior points in the
range of integration should be chosen large if the bound-
ary elements si and sl are close to each other and small
if they are far away. Moreover, our experience is that the
results are considerably more accurate if the boundary
elements are not approximated by straight lines but, in-
stead, the exact shape of the boundary elements is used
for all interior points in the range of integration.

Due to the almost singular behaviour of the integral
kernels at r′ = r, the diagonal elements Cll and Bll re-
quire special care. Inserting the limiting cases for small
boundary-element length ∆sl in Eqs. (10) and (11) into
Eq. (7) gives

A. Treatment of corners

If a point r′ is a corner of a cavity then the integral
kernel of Cll has an essential singularity caused by a di-
verging curvature κ; see Eq. (11). To circumvent this
diﬃculty, we smooth the boundary as sketched in Fig. 3.
The curvature κ is then everywhere bounded.

The minimum value of the radius of curvature, ρ =
1/κ, along such a rounded corner should be much larger
than the typical distance between discretization points,
so that the boundary is locally smooth. However, in or-
der to ensure that the rounding does not inﬂuence the
result, ρ should be much smaller than the wavelength λ.
Clearly, these requirements can be met most eﬃciently by
using a nonuniform discretization with a relatively large
density of discretization points at corners as illustrated
in Fig. 3. Since the results do not depend on the partic-
ular selected rounding and discretization we do not give
explicit formulas.

(circles) is enhanced at the corner.

B. Finding and computing resonances

The scattering problem as discussed in Sec. II B pro-
vides us with ﬁrst approximations to the wave numbers
of the resonances. Let us ﬁx φ to an appropriate value
and plot the total cross section in Eq. (20) as function of
k in the range of interest. Resonances can be identiﬁed
as peaks. The peak position α and the width γ deter-
iγ/2.
mine the resonant wave number as kres ≈
It might be diﬃcult to resolve numerically very broad
and very narrow peaks, because they are hidden either in
the background or between two consecutive grid points.
For microlaser operation, however, these two extreme
cases are not relevant. Too short-lived resonances (broad
peaks) fail to provide a suﬃcient long lifetime for the
light to accumulate the gain required to overcome the
lasing threshold, whereas too long-lived resonances (nar-
row peaks) do not supply enough output power.

k1 = α

−

The spurious solutions of the interior Dirichlet prob-
lem occasionally appear in the scattering spectrum as

6

extremely narrow peaks. The reason is that numerical
inaccuracies broaden the δ-peaks to peaks of ﬁnite width.
However, choosing a suﬃciently ﬁne boundary discretiza-
tion and/or an appropriate, not too ﬁne discretization in
k reduces the probability of observing them. Moreover,
they can be removed with a simple trick: use k with a
small negative imaginary part in Eq. (20).

The discretized version of Eq. (14) has a nontrivial so-
lution only if det M (kres) = 0. Using a ﬁrst approxima-
tion k1 from the scattering problem as starting value, we
ﬁnd a much better approximation to kres in the complex
plane with the help of Newton’s method

kl+1 = kl −

g(kl)
g′(kl)

(35)

with l = 1, 2, . . . and g(k) = det M (k). The derivative
g′(k) = ∂g(k)/∂k can be approximated by

where ∆ is a small real number. Equation (35) is re-

Newton’s method in Eq. (35) is very eﬃcient close to
an isolated resonance where det M
kres. For q-
fold degenerate resonances the determinant behaves like
kres)q. The resulting problem of slow convergence
(k
can be eliminated by choosing g = (det M )1/q.

A slightly diﬀerent approach for ﬁnding resonances can
be gained by rewriting Newton’s method in Eq. (35) with
the help of the matrix identity ln det M = tr ln M as

kl+1 = kl −

q
tr[M −1(kl)M ′(kl)]

,

(37)

where tr denotes the trace of a matrix. The derivative
M ′(k) can be calculated as in Eq. (36). It turns out that
the numerical algorithm corresponding to Eq. (37) is a
bit faster than the original Newton’s method in Eq. (35).
Having found a particular wave number kres, the vector
components φl and ψl are given by the null eigenvector of
the square matrix M (kres). This eigenvector can be found
with, for instance, singular value decomposition [32]. The
wave function in each domain Ωj is then constructed by
discretizing Eq. (6)

where l runs over all boundary elements of Γj.

How ﬁne must be the discretization of the boundary
in order to obtain a good approximation of a resonance
at kres? The local wavelength λ = 2π/nRe(kres) is the
smallest scale on which the wave function and its deriva-
tive may vary. Hence, the minimum number of bound-
ary elements along each wavelength, b = λ/∆s, should

be larger or equal than at least 4; ∆s is the maximum
value of all lengths ∆si. We have veriﬁed the BEM us-
ing diﬀerent values of b. Taking b = 16, we ﬁnd good
agreement with the separation-of-variables solution of the
circular cavity (see e.g. Ref. [20]) and to results of the
wave-matching method obtained for the quadrupolar cav-
ity [1]. Only for extremely long-lived resonances larger
b are necessary to determine the very small imaginary
parts of k accurately (recall that this is important for
distinguishing spurious solutions from real resonances).
However, as already explained, extremely long-lived res-
onances are not relevant for microlaser applications and,
moreover, they occur only in circular or slightly deformed
circular cavities for which the wave-matching method is
more suitable anyway.

IV. EXAMPLE: TWO COUPLED
HEXAGONAL-SHAPED CAVITIES

Vietze et al. have experimentally realized hexagonal-
shaped microlasers by putting laser active dyes into
5 [14]. Numerical sim-
molecular sieves made of AlPO4 −
ulations based on the wave-matching method have been
restricted to strongly rounded hexagons in order to avoid
the convergence problems at corners [15, 33]. The fol-
lowing example is relevant for future experiments and
demonstrates that the BEM can handle arbitrarily sharp
corners and, moreover, coupled resonators. Near-ﬁeld-
coupling of resonators is interesting, because it may im-
prove the optical properties of the resonators, as e.g. the
far-ﬁeld directionality.

Figure 4 illustrates the conﬁguration: two hexagonal
cavities with sidelength R are displaced by the vector
(1.8R, 5R). According to the experiments in Ref. [14, 15],
the polarization is of TM type, the index of refraction is
n = 1.466 inside the cavities and n = 1 outside; R ranges
from 4µm to 10µm, the wavelength λ from 600nm to
800nm depending on the dye. Since only the ratio be-
tween R and λ is relevant, we use in the following the di-
mensionless wave number kR. We focus on a kR-interval
from 20 to 25 within the experimental spectral interval.
A total of 2N = 3200 discretization points is then suf-
ﬁcient. We slightly smooth the corners as discussed in
Sec. III A such that ρ/λ

Figure 5 shows the total cross section σ for plane-wave
scattering with incidence angle φ = 15◦ computed from
Eq. (20). The dominant structure is a series of equidis-
tant peaks of roughly Lorentzian shape. At kR
23.25
we identify a spurious solution of the interior Dirichlet
problem. The fact that it is the only one visible in the
chosen range of wave numbers conﬁrms that the spurious
solutions are not a problem.

cation on the properties of the microlasers will be given

V. SUMMARY

We have introduced a boundary element method
(BEM) to compute TM and TE polarized resonances
with intermediate lifetimes in dielectric cavities. We have
discussed spurious solutions, the treatment of cavities
with symmetries and cavities with corners. Numerical
results are shown for an example of two coupled hexago-
nal cavities.

If compared to ﬁnite-diﬀerence methods and related
methods the BEM is very eﬃcient since the wave function
and its derivative are only evaluated at the boundaries
It is in general less eﬃcient than the
of the cavities.
wave-matching method but in contrast to the latter it
can be applied to complex geometries, such as cavities
with corners and coupled cavities.

8

The BEM is especially suitable for computing phase
space representations of wave functions such as the
Husimi function which also only requires the wave func-
tion and its normal derivative on the domain bound-
aries [34].

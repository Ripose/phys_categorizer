Abstract

The use of speciﬁc symmetry properties of the optical second-harmonic generation

(the s,s-exclusion rule) has allowed us to observe high-contrast hyper-Rayleigh inter-

ference patterns in a completely diﬀuse light - an eﬀect having no analog in case of

linear (Rayleigh) scattering.

In the past few years the versatility of optical second-harmonic generation (SHG)1 as

a probe for studying solid state nanostructures and low-dimensional systems has been em-

bodied in experimental methods of SHG interferometry (phase measurements)2 and hyper-

Rayleigh scattering (HRS)3. These methods exploit opposite features of the second-harmonic

(SH) radiation generated by an object being studied: the former implies coherence of the

SH radiation, whereas the latter deals with incoherent SHG originating from spatial ﬂuctu-

ations of the optical parameters in a randomly inhomogeneous system. Therefore the very

idea of the HRS interferometry may seem contradictory, which is, however, disproved by a

more detailed analysis of a conventional experimental scheme of SHG interferometry. In this

scheme shown in Fig. 1, panel 1, the interference pattern is formed by the SH wave from a

sample studied and that from another object having well-deﬁned optical characteristics and

used as a reference. The phase shift between the two waves results from the dispersion of the

refraction index of air n, which yields the following dependence of the total SHG intensity

I2ω on the reference translation:

I2ω(xR) = I S

2ω + I R

2ω + 2αqI S

2ωI R

2ω cos [Φ0 + K(xR

xS)] ,

−

(1)

where I S

2ω and I R

2ω are the intensities of the SH waves from the sample and the reference,

respectively, α is the mutual coherence factor of the two waves, xS and xR are the coordinates

of the sample and the reference, respectively, measured in the reference translation direction,

Φ0 is position-independent part of the relative phase shift between the two waves, K =

2ω(n(2ω)

n(ω))/c and ω is the fundamental radiation frequency. The essential point is

−

that the SH wave from the reference is then reﬂected from the sample. It is the feature of

the interferometry scheme that allows us to observe HRS interference patterns. A randomly

inhomogeneous sample is a source of both HRS of the fundamental radiation and Rayleigh

scattering (RS) of the SH wave generated by the reference and then linearly reﬂected by

the sample. In other words, the SH wave from the reference, after being reﬂected from the

sample, becomes ’modulated’ by the spatial ﬂuctuations of the linear-optical properties of

the sample. Therefore the interfering SH ﬁelds from the reference and the sample will both

2

have incoherent components that are mutually coherent (statistically dependent) because

of their common statistical origin: the spatial ﬂuctuations of the optical parameters of the

sample. This modiﬁes Eq.(1) for the resulting interference pattern as follows:

I2ω(xR) = I S

2ω + I R

2ω + 2 ¯αq ¯I S

2ω cos[ ¯Φ + KxR] + 2

2ω = ¯I R

2ω + ˜I R

2ω and the bar (tilde) over a quantity denotes a coherent

(incoherent) component. For the s-in,s-out wave-polarization combination the coherent com-

ponent ¯I S

2ω vanishes due to the s,s-exclusion rule4, and solely an HRS interference pattern is

observed.

In this paper we study two types of inhomogeneous solid ﬁlms: those of purple membranes

of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) and polycrystalline Pbx(Zr0.53Ti0.47)O3 (PZT) ferroelectric ﬁlms.

bR ﬁlms with a thickness of about 1000 nm were prepared by the method described in Ref.

[5]. PZT texture ﬁlms were fabricated by the sol-gel technique6 and then annealed at 6500C.

For SHG experiments the output of a Q - switched YAG:Nd3+ laser at 1064 nm is used

as a fundamental radiation with the pulse duration, repetiton rate and intensity being 15

ns, 12.5 Hz and 1 MW/cm2, respectively The s-polarized fundamental wave irradiates the

sample at an angle of incidence θ0 = 450. Having passed through a set of color ﬁlters, the

s-polarized SH component is then detected by a PMT. The interference patterns I2ω(xR)

are obtained by translating the reference along the laser beam. The reference is a 2 mm-

thick plate of fused quartz coated by a 30 nm-thick indium-tin oxide ﬁlm. Declining the

reference by (0

2ω but not the intensity of the fundamental radiation transmitted through the

reference. This allows us to balance the values of I S

2ω and I R

interference-pattern contrast attained at I S

separately by inserting an appropriate ﬁlter (infrared or green, respectively) in between the

2ω. The values of I S
I R

2ω and I R

2ω are measured

reference and sample. Fig. 1 shows the interference patterns for bR (panel 2) and PZT

(panel 3) ﬁlms. Well-pronounced oscillations of the total SHG intensity are observed.

Three additional optical experiments are performed for more thorough interpretation of

3

the HRS interferometry data. First, the dependences of the SH intensity I2ω on the azimuthal

angle ψ of the sample rotation about the axis normal to the ﬁlm plane were measured and

are presented in insets in Figs. 2, 3. For the bR ﬁlm the dependence I2ω(ψ) is practically

isotropic within the error bars, whereas for the PZT ﬁlm a pronounced anisotropy with

one-fold symmetry occurs7. The interference pattern shown in Fig. 1, panel 3 was measured

in the minimum of this dependence. Second, the dependences of the SH intensity on the

polar scattering angle θ (HRS indicatrix) were measured and are shown in Figs. 2, 3. For

both types of ﬁlms the HRS indicatrices have maxima at θ = θ0, but no SH signal jump

is observed in the vicinity of the specular direction. This proves the absence of the regular

SHG contribution in the specular direction for the s-in, s-out polarization combination at

the values of the azumuthal angle chosen for the HRS interferometry measurements. Third,

linear, or Rayleigh, scattering indicatrices were measured at the SH wavelength and are

shown in Figs. 2, 3. The RS indicatrices, in contrast with the HRS ones, have sharp

specular peaks corresponding to the coherent reﬂection of light.

Both the HRS indicatrix and that of RS with the coherent-reﬂection peak subtracted

can be approximated by a superposition of two Gaussian peaks:

Iσ(θ) = IσT (θ) (cid:16)exp n−

[k(θ)lσ]2

o +γσexp n−

[k(θ)Lσ]2

o(cid:17) ,

(3)

where k(θ) = 2ω (sin θ

sin θ0) /c, σ = 1, 2, the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the RS and

−

HRS indicatrices, respectively, T (θ) is a known function being the transmission coeﬃcient

of the ﬁlm-air interface at the SH wavelength with the dielectric constant of the ﬁlm as an

adjustable parameter, Iσ, γσ, lσ, Lσ are adjustable parameters. The quantities lσ and Lσ

are correlation lengths characterizing the in-plane scales of spatial ﬂuctuations of optical

parameters in the ﬁlms. The ﬁtting to the experimental data yields lbR

type RS and HRS have two common ﬂuctuating sources that are statistically independent

and characterized by Gaussian correlation functions with quite diﬀerent correlation lengths

l and L. One of the sources is likely to be the inhomogeneities in bR and PZT ﬁlms:

membrane aggregates and microcrystallites, respectively. The other one presumably is the

ﬁlm interfacial roughness.

Since the interference patterns are measured under conditions that provide vanishing of

the coherent SH signal from the sample, Eq.(2) takes the form:

Thus the key point of our explanation of the mutual coherence occurring for the SH

wave from reference and the diﬀuse SH signal from the sample is the fact that the SH radi-

ation from the reference is subsequently reﬂected from the sample, which leads to statistical

dependence of the signals.

According to the data on the RS and HRS indicatrices for both bR and PZT ﬁlms, each

HRS interference pattern can be decomposed into superposition of two interference patterns

originating from the two statistically independent sources with correlation lengths l and L.

Taking into account that, according to Eq.(3),

interferometry of incoherent second-harmonic generation, or hyper-

Rayleigh scattering, by inhomogeneous ﬁlms of bacteriorhodopsin and ferroelectric ceramics

has been carried out. High-contrast interference patterns are observed. This is interpreted

as a result of mutual coherence of the second-harmonic radiation from the ﬁlm proper and

the reference second-harmonic wave incoherently reﬂected by the ﬁlm.

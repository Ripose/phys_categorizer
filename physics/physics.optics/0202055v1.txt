of electromagnetic waves.

(February 2, 2008)

We present a study of the interaction of a relativistically planar channeled electron with an intense
electromagnetic ﬁeld. Using a S-Matrix approach in the Strong Field Approximation, it is shown
that the crystal periodicity aﬀects drastically the excitation process, suppressing the possibility
of multiphoton absorption except for some particular cases. This selective excitation opens the
possibility to control the dynamics of the channeling process by means of an external ﬁeld. Explicit
expressions for the S-matrix N-photon excitation rates together with the corresponding conservation
laws are obtained from the relativistic quantum mechanical Dirac equation.

I. INTRODUCTION

Channeling in crystal lattices occurs when an acceler-
ated charged particle is introduced into a crystalline tar-
get at suﬃciently large energy. Depending on the crystal
orientation, the particle’s trajectory may be aligned with
a major crystal direction and the penetration may reach
anomalous depths. Although the possibility of this ef-
fect was already pointed out very early by Stark [1], it
was demonstrated experimentally 50 years later by Rol
et al. [2], when the result of the ion sputtering was found
to depend strongly on the orientation of the target crys-
tal. After the discovery, the theoretical and experimental
work increased rapidly and extended to the case of chan-
neling of electrons and positrons [3].

In this paper we will investigate the excitation dynam-
ics of a planar channeled electron under the inﬂuence
of an external electromagnetic ﬁeld. As a main result,
we demonstrate that the crystal periodicity introduces a
momentum conservation condition which aﬀects the ef-
ﬁciency of the diﬀerent N-photon channels of excitation,
leading to the strong suppression of photon absorption
in a broad range of situations. The multiphoton exci-
tation of channeled particles has been already addressed
by Avetissian et al. [4,5] by assuming an electromagnetic
wave copropagating with the electron, and with a fre-
quency resonant to the (Doppler-shifted) lower-energy
level transitions.
In the present case, however, we are
interested in a complementary situation where the chan-
neled electron is excited to a ﬁnal state lying in the crys-
tal quasi-continuum. Since the transition is produced by
the interaction of the electron with an external intense
optical ﬁeld, the strong ﬁeld approximation (SFA) con-
stitutes a more appropriated procedure in comparison to
the discrete level approach in [4].

SFA theories have been developed in the context of
ionization of atoms in strong laser ﬁelds. Among them,
the so-called Keldish-Faisal-Reiss (KFR) theory [6–8] is

based on the S-matrix approach, where the ﬁnal state
is approximated by a Volkov state, which describes the
evolution of a free electron driven by the electromag-
netic wave. SFA theories describe most of the relevant
aspects of the atomic ionization, including multiphoton
absorption and multiphoton excitation above the ioniza-
tion threshold (ATI).

Although employed mainly in the atomic and molecu-
lar context, S-matrix SFA approaches can be used in any
general situation in which the ﬁeld interaction energy is
comparable with the energies of the matter system. In
fact, for the higher energy boundstates, the intensity of
the ﬁeld required to promote an electron to the contin-
uum does not have to be very high, and yet SFA can be
used. On the other hand, SFA requires the matter po-
tential to be approximately constant over the complete
interaction time. In our case it suﬃces with a moderate
intensity ﬁeld, (1012 −1013W/cm2), while the crystal sta-
bility can be ensured by a suﬃciently short pulse (about
100f s), which still enclose enough cycles to ensure the
adiabatic limit involved in the theoretical approach. It
should be mention that, in the case of atom ionization by
strong ﬁeld, the adiabatic assumption is correct even in
the case of a few cycles pulse-length, and there is no rea-
son to think that in this channeling case the thing should
be diﬀerent.

II. GEOMETRY OF THE SYSTEM AND
DESCRIPTION OF THE UNPERTURBED
CHANNELED ELECTRON.

Let us consider the interacting geometry depicted in
ﬁg. 1. A relativistic electron, with velocity parallel to
the x − axis, is introduced in a crystal while interacting
with a copropagating or a counterpropagating electro-
magnetic wave. For particular crystal orientations, the
electron is conﬁned transversely to trajectories close to

1

(4)

(5)

the initial injection axis. Our case of planar channeling
occurs when the electron is injected parallel to a crystal
plane [3,9]. We will assume an electromagnetic planewave
ﬁeld, which propagates in the same direction of the in-
jected electron, and linearly polarized in the y − axis, i.e.
orthogonal to the crystal plane.

Since the channeled particle is injected with a relativis-
tic velocity, the crystal potential may be well approxi-
mated by a spatial average over the crystal plane coor-
dinates, as it is done in the so-called continuum model
[3],

where Lx and Ly are the crystal plane dimensions, and
U (x, y, z) is the crystal potential. With this eﬀective po-
tential the electron motion in the crystal channel, driven
by the external e.m. ﬁeld, will be conﬁned to the polar-
ization plane xy.

In the most general case, the quantum description of
the electron’s dynamics is described by the Dirac equa-
tion

cα · (ˆp − eA/c) + βmc2 + V (y)

Φ(x) = EBΦ(x) (2)

(cid:8)
Let us ﬁrst consider the unperturbed channeling situ-
ation, A = 0. Since the averaged potential depends only
on the y coordinate, a general positive energy solution of
the channeled electron can be written as

(cid:9)

Φ(x) =

Introducing (3) into (2), with A = 0, one can obtain
the following form for the Dirac equation in momentum
space:

Being Vp the Fourier transform of the interplanar poten-
tial at the spatial frequency p/~. Due to the nature of the
averaged potential, the channeling along a crystal plane
is only possible if the energy of the electron’s transversal
dynamics is moderate, i.e. non relativistic. In this case,
it is justiﬁed to approximate equation (5) to second order
of cpy/Epx.

By introducing eq. (6-8) into (5), and since the scalar
py is a ﬁrst order term in cpy/Ex, the Dirac
potential Vpy
equation is reduced to the same identity for every non-
zero component of the spinor u1

Several explicit forms of the averaged crystal potential
may be found in the literature [3]. Among them, those
derived from the Thomas-Fermi screened two-body po-
tentials have been widely used [3,9], and have been ﬁne
adjusted by standard Hartree-Fock many-body calcula-
tions [14]. From the theoretical point of view, model
potentials are more convenient, since they allow for fur-
ther analytical work while keeping the essential features
of the interaction. For instance, V (y) = −4V0y2/d2 was

proposed by Avetissian et al. [4] in the context of com-
putation of the multiphoton transitions between bound
states of the continuum potential, for a positron inter-
acting with a strong electromagnetic wave. The form
2(y/b) has also been used to study the
V (y) = −V0 cosh−
possible ampliﬁcation of x-ray channeling radiation [5].
This later form has a better resemblance with the av-
eraged Thomas-Fermi potentials while still allowing for
an analytical diagonalization and, therefore, we shall use
this potential for our calculations. The transverse energy
spectrum for this case can be cast in the following form
[5]:

. Note that, as a result of the spatial
averaging, the scattering with the continuum potential
q
aﬀects only to the transverse dynamics of the channeled
particle, while the very large longitudinal momentum re-
mains unaﬀected.

III. S MATRIX DESCRIPTION OF A
CHANNELED PARTICLE INTERACTING WITH
AN ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE.

Let us now add the electromagnetic excitation to the
problem. As it is well known, eq. (2) does not accept
analytical solutions for a space-time dependent vector
potential. In such situations, the S-matrix approach of-
fers a standard procedure to ﬁnd approximated solutions
[15], used specially in quantum ﬁeld theory [10,16,17] and
scattering [18].

)

can be exported to any other system, provided its eigen-
states can be found analytically. To our knowledge, how-
ever, this is the ﬁrst time that it is applied to the rel-
ativistic channeled electron in interaction with an elec-
tromagnetic wave. In the present case, Φi corresponds
to the unperturbed channeled electron state discussed in
sec. II, and Ψ(
is an arbitrary ﬁnal state, solution of
−
f
the complete equation (2). Since this exact solution is not
available, the success of the S-matrix approach consist in
ﬁnding a suitable approximation. In the strong ﬁeld ap-
proximation, the interaction with electromagnetic ﬁeld
is assumed to be the relevant for the ﬁnal state, there-
fore Ψ(
is approximated in terms of the Volkov states,
−
f
ΨV (x, t) [22,23]. These wavefunctions are solutions of
eq. (2) for V (y) = 0 and A(x, t) 6= 0, and describe a free
electron in the presence of an electromagnetic ﬁeld. The
form of these states for a laser ﬁeld pulse of arbitrary
form is [23]:

A. The general relativistic case

The relativistic SFA S-matrix theory for the Dirac elec-
tron in an atom can be found in [19–21]. The general ex-
pression for the transition amplitude using time-reversed

where we have used (13) and we have assumed the trans-

IV. CONSERVATION LAWS AND CLOSING OF
EXCITATION CHANNELS.

As expressed in eq.

(43), the transition probability
is a function of the initial momentum-space probability
amplitude, ˜Φi(qN ). Let us now assume injected electron
of positive energy with a wavefunction of the form (3),
therefore ǫr = +1. From the delta function in eq. (43),
we obtain the following energy conservation relation:

where we have deﬁned the initial energy of the electron as

The interpretation of this energy conservation relation is
straight-forward if we take as reference system a frame
propagating with the electron, with its initial velocity
(px)i/(γx)im. The frequency ω′ = ωγB (1 ∓ (βx)i) cor-
responds to the Doppler-shifted electromagnetic wave,
and (γx)iǫB is the result of the Lorentz transform of the
bound state energy (11) from the laboratory to the mov-
ing frame. Equation (55) states the resonance condition
for a (Doppler-shifted) N -photon transition from a bound
state to a state lying in the crystal quasi-continuum of
(52) and (53). This is, in
momentum given by eqs.

essence, the crystal equivalent to the ionization of atoms
by intense ﬁelds. Note, however, that in the atom case
a ionization channel for any photon number N is always
possible, since the initial state is distributed continuously
over the momentum space and, therefore, a non-zero
transition probability exists for any (py)i which fulﬁlls
the condition (55). This is not the case for the chan-
neled electron, since the crystal plane periodicity forces
a discretization of the electron states in the transverse
coordinate of the momentum space py = ˜n 2πh
= ˜n∆py,
dp
being ˜n an integer and dp the interplanar distance. As a
consequence, in the general case the N -photon channel of
excitation should be strongly suppressed, except in those
particular cases in which

holds for N and ˜n as integer numbers. As a consequence,
this opens the possibility of selective excitation of chan-
neled electrons in terms of their initial velocity, or per-
mits its control through the variation of the electromag-
netic ﬁeld parameters. Figure 2a-d show the possible
N -photon channel excitations as a function of the initial
electron’s energy and for the lowest orders of transverse
momentum transferred ˜n. Each plot shows the result
for a diﬀerent initial channeling bound-state. We assume
planar channeling along the (110) plane of Si by selecting
the potential parameters V0 = 20.4 eV and b = 0.03 nm
reproducing [25], and a counterpropagating TiSa laser of
3.51 × 1012W/cm2 (λ ≃ 800nm). Note that the number
of photons N should be an integer quantity, therefore
the ﬁgure shows clearly that, except for very particu-
lar choices of the electron’s initial energy, the excitation
channels are closed.

The same ﬁgure can be done for the case of a copropa-
gating electromagnetic ﬁeld. Figure 3a-d show again the
possible N -photon channel excitations as a function of
the initial electron’s energy, for the lowest orders of trans-
verse momentum transferred assuming the same crystal
and laser parameters as in ﬁgure 2. An important in-
crease of the number of photons needed to excite the
electron, attributable to the Doppler redshift, can be ob-
served. Under this circumstances, even when the en-
ergy and momentum constrains are fulﬁlled, the process
may involve a very small transition probability due to the
high number of photons needed. To give an idea of the
order of this probability one can make use of the asymp-
totic expansion of the Bessel functions for large orders,
n
Jn(x) ≈ 1
,
to calculate a limit of the number of photons above which
the transition probability will be negligible. The criterion
to be used here will be to consider negligible the Bessel
function when ne
≤ 0.1. Applying it to our case one
obtain the limit of the number of photons for each trans-
verse momentum transferred as a function of the ﬁnal

where ω′ = ωγ(1 − βx). Assuming that the electron
ﬁnishes in a state of the crystal quasi-continuum and
that the energy along the axial direction do not change
signiﬁcantly during the evolution, one can approximate
γ ≈ (γx)i and βx ≈ (βx)i. Consequently ω′, and there-
fore NLimit, can be expressed as a function of the initial
electron’s energy. Figure 3a-d show with arrows the point
when the number of photons required for the excitation
process surpass the NLimit. For energies above this point,
the transition probability reduces drastically and we can
consider that no excitation takes place, even though the
energy and momentum conservation relations may be ful-
ﬁlled. It should be pointed out that eq. (57) is only valid
for the case of large orders in the Bessel functions. This
means that it should be taken qualitatively in all cases in
which NLimit is a small quantity, as for instance in ﬁgure
3a for the case ˜n = 0. Note also that those cases in which
the arrow is not shown correspond to NLimit outside the
plotting region, i.e. the N -photon excitation is possible
along the complete plotted line.

Finally, let us remark the fact that the photon exci-
tation number is greater than in the counterpropagating
case increases the sensitivity of the channel process to
the selective excitation in terms of the laser parameters.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have computed the explicit forms of the S-matrix
transition probabilities for the N-photon absorption of a
relativistic electron channeled along a crystal plane. In
contrast to previous works, we consider the interaction
with an intense electromagnetic wave, generated exter-
nally, which may excite the electron to high-energy states
lying in the crystal quasi-continuum. Due to the crys-
tal periodicity, we show that the energy and momentum
conservation equations constraint strongly this excitation
process, suppressing the multiphoton absorption except
for some particular cases. Under these circumstances, the
selection of a single multiphoton channel of excitation is
feasible by an adequate choice of the external laser pa-
rameters, opening a broad range of possibilities for the
coherent control of the channel electron’s dynamics. The
case of an electromagnetic ﬁeld copropagating with the
injected electron is also studied showing an important
increase of the number of photons needed to excite the
electron due to the Doppler redshift. For this case, we
give an estimation of the maximum photon number for
which the excitation process is not negligible. The se-
lective excitation in the copropagating case is found to
be more sensitive to the electron’s energy and the trans-

7

verse momentum transferred in the transition than in the
counterpropagating one.

FIG. 2. This ﬁgures shows the values of (γx)i needed to
open a speciﬁc N-photon excitation channel for the lowest or-
ders of transverse momentum transferred ˜n. All the pictures
correspond to an electron channeled along the (110) plane of
silicon, driven by a counterpropagating linear polarized TiSa
laser, λ = 800 nm, of 3.51 × 10
. The diﬀerent pic-
tures represent distinct initial bound states of the interplanar
potential. The top one corresponds to the ground state case
(n = 0), the second picture to the ﬁrst excited state (n = 1)
and so on. The continuous, dotted and dashed lines represent
the excitation process with zero, one and two quanta of trans-
verse momentum transferred (˜n = 0, ±1, ±2) respectively.

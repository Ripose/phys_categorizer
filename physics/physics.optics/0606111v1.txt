Wideband pulse propagation: single-ﬁeld and multi-ﬁeld approaches to Raman interactions

(Dated: July 22, 2013)

We model the process of ultra broadband light generation in which a pair of laser pulses separated by the
Raman frequency drive a Raman transition. In contrast to the usual approach using separate ﬁeld envelopes for
the different frequency components, we treat the ﬁeld as a single entity. This requires the inclusion of few-cycle
corrections to the pulse propagation. Our single-ﬁeld model makes fewer approximations and is mathematically
(and hence computationally) simpler, although it does require greater computational resources to implement.
The single-ﬁeld theory reduces to the traditional multi-ﬁeld one using appropriate approximations.

I.

INTRODUCTION

An important aim of current wideband Raman experiments
is to efﬁciently generate few-cycle pulses [1, 2, 3, 4]. If driven
strongly enough, the two-photon Raman transition modulates
the incoming ﬁeld by adding sidebands separated by the tran-
sition frequency. Wideband ﬁelds are generated as these side-
bands generate sidebands of their own (and so on); a wide
comb of frequency components separated by the transition
frequency is generated in this way. If a scheme can be imple-
mented that adjusts the phases of each component appropri-
ately, then few- or single- cycle optical pulses can be obtained
(see e.g. [2]).

In standard theoretical treatments of the Raman process, the
ﬁeld is split into frequency components centred on the teeth
of the frequency comb. This approach has the advantage that
the components can be modeled reasonably well with slowly
varying envelopes, but of course it has the disadvantage that
one needs to keep track of a large number of components. In
this paper, we study an alternative approach in which the ﬁeld
is treated as a single entity rather than being split into pieces.
Note that this approach is distinct from methods based on the
direct solution of Maxwell’s equations such as FDTD (ﬁnite
difference time domain)[5] or PSSD (pseudospectral spatial
domain)[6]. Our single-ﬁeld is based on a second-order wave
equation, and uses a convenient choice of carrier to deﬁne a
ﬁeld envelope. As we will demonstrate, the latter technique
offers signiﬁcant advantages over the traditional multi-ﬁeld
formalism.

To provide a context for the discussion, we consider exper-
iments such as those of Sali et.al. [4, 7], where the Raman
transition is driven near-resonantly by a pair of intense pump
pulses about 100fs long; compared to the transition frequency
of about 130THz, the spectra of each pump pulse (and hence
the generated sidebands) are relatively narrow. This means
that a multi-component model is still not unreasonable, even
if numerical considerations might demand that the arrays used
to store these spectra overlap in frequency space. However, if
we were to move to shorter pump pulses, or to a single (much

shorter) pump pulse with enough bandwidth to efﬁciently ex-
cite the transition, we would reach the regime where the teeth
of the frequency comb signiﬁcantly overlap. At this point,
one would be forced not only to move from a solution based
on the Slowly-Varying Envelope Approximation (SVEA) to a
more accurate model such as the Generalized Few-Cycle En-
velope Approximation (GFEA) [8, 9], but the utility of mul-
tiple ﬁeld components would in any case become question-
able. This provides the motivation for the present work, since
our model can extend the regime in which the advantages of
envelope-based methods can be utilised; it also turns out to
be more versatile, placing fewer restrictions on the kinds of
Raman media that can be easily described.

In this paper, we will construct a single-ﬁeld model which,
in most other respects, closely parallels the approach to wide-
band Raman generation adopted by Hickman et. al.
[10].
A key feature of the single-ﬁeld model is that the coupling
constants oscillate at the Raman frequency, and it is this that
impresses the sideband modulation on the propagating ﬁeld.
Since the ﬁeld is now not only wide-band but contains signiﬁ-
cant sideband components (i.e. distinct sub-peaks, as opposed
to a broad featureless background), the ﬁeld envelope is no
longer slowly-varying and must therefore be propagated using
the GFEA. This necessity can be demonstrated by comparing
the results of the single-ﬁeld model with those of a multi-ﬁeld
counterpart.

The paper is organized as follows: section II outlines the
derivation of the single-ﬁeld Raman theory, section III shows
how to reduce it to a standard multi-ﬁeld version, and section
IV applies the theory to practical situations. In section V we
discuss some of the issues relating to our Raman model and
its numerical implementation, and ﬁnally section VI contains
our conclusions.

II. SINGLE-FIELD RAMAN THEORY

We start by considering the wave function y

of a single
molecule (e.g. H2) and the electric ﬁeld E, and write the
time-dependent wave function by expanding it in terms of the
eigenfunctions in the ﬁeld-free (i.e. E = 0) case. This means
we can get the expansion coefﬁcients by solving for an ef-
fective Schr¨odinger equation that contains a two-photon Rabi
frequency created by means of an interaction term based on

a ﬁeld-dependent dipole moment. We assume a dispersion-
less medium and write all equations in terms of position z and
retarded times t = tlab − z/c. Here we follow the method of
Hickman, Paisner, and Bischel [10] (HPB), but we use only a
single E ﬁeld rather than multiple components. Note that HPB
use Gaussian units, so there may appear to be inconsistencies
when comparing our formulae (in S.I.) to theirs.

We denote the known molecular eigenfunctions of the un-
perturbed Hamiltonian H0 as |ni, and their corresponding en-
ergies ~Wn. We want to obtain the solution to

where d is the electronic dipole moment operator and the cn
are a set of complex probability amplitudes.

We now replace the electric ﬁeld E with a carrier-envelope
description, but, unlike HPB, we use only a single component
centred at a frequency of w 0, rather than a set indexed by an
integer j. The envelope and carrier for the ﬁeld is:

E = Ae−ı(w 0t−k0z) + c.c.,
and, following the standard procedure of assuming the co-
efﬁcients ci are slowly varying, discarding terms at multiples
of the carrier frequency, and simplifying, we eventually reach

The a n j coupling parameters oscillate because, in contrast
to the HPB derivation, there is no frequency difference be-
tween ﬁeld components to cancel with the Raman transition
frequency. We now take the indices 1 and 2 to correspond
to the two states involved in the Raman transition of inter-
est; these will be the 0 and 1 vibrational (or perhaps rota-
tional) levels of the electronic ground state.
Indices 3 and
above will correspond to (quoting HPB) “translational motion
on higher electronic states”. Since we are interested only in
the Raman transition, we specialize the above equations for
the coefﬁcients cn, calculating c1 and c2 only, and assuming
that the d12 = h1| d |2i dipole moment is zero. This means
we will only be including transitions between indices 1 and 2
that go via one of the higher states j ≥ 3, since we still allow
d1 j, d2 j 6= 0 ∀ j ≥ 3. Further, we solve for the coefﬁcients for
the higher states in terms of c1 and c2, in an adiabatic approx-
imation justiﬁed when c1 and c2 vary only slowly compared
to the exponential terms.

When converting the equations for c1, c2 into Bloch equa-
tions, we make the same approximations as HPB: keeping the
energy separations for all transitions greater than that of the
1 ↔ 2 transition, and ignoring all the higher vibrational (or
rotational) states. Thus we can write

by Brabec and Krausz [11]. Although the full form is not
included for reasons of brevity, it could easily be introduced if
the extra accuracy was desired; indeed we routinely use it in
our simulation codes. It is independent of the Raman deriva-
tion presented here, since it is a ﬁeld propagation effect. The
full form of the few-cycle prefactor (and various expansions
thereof) has already been reported in [8, 9].

A detailed derivation of this single-ﬁeld Raman theory can

be found in [12]

We solve these equations numerically using a split step
method, where we treat the nonlinearity in the time domain,
and the dispersion in the frequency domain. To include dis-
persion in a time domain equation like eqn.(15) requires ei-
ther additional time derivatives (as in [8, 9]) or a convolu-
tion over a time-response function which is an N2 operation.

However, handling dispersion in the frequency domain is both
conceptually simpler (since it simply amounts to a frequency-
dependent phase evolution), and more computationally efﬁ-
cient because it is an N log N process.

The validity of the approximations used in deriving our
Bloch equations will obviously depend both on the details of
the chosen Raman medium and/or transition, and on the num-
ber of Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands we wish to describe.
Since in the experiments of [1, 2, 3, 4, 13] the emphasis was
on a single Raman transition, a simple Bloch model is clearly
appropriate, and indeed our approximations differ little from
those of other theoretical approaches (such at that of HPB).

III. MULTI-FIELD RAMAN THEORY

The single-ﬁeld Raman model can be converted into a tra-
ditional multi-ﬁeld model as developed in e.g. HPB [10] or
Syed, McDonald and New [15] by replacing the ﬁeld enve-
lope with a sum of multiple envelopes using carrier exponen-
tials spaced at the Raman frequency. When doing this, we
will only get the correct multi-ﬁeld form if few-cycle (either
SEWA or GFEA) corrections to the ﬁeld evolution part of the
theory are applied to the effective polarization caused by the
Raman transition.

Since the single-ﬁeld evolution equation (eqn.(15)) uses an
envelope A that is based on a carrier (see eqn.(4)), the single-
ﬁeld envelope A is replaced with A j’s at frequency w
j = w 0 +
jw b and wavevector k j = k(w
j). The single-ﬁeld envelope in
terms of the new A j’s is

Quite a lot of physics has been removed by the RWA ap-
proximation, although it is a very reasonable one except in the
very wideband limit. For example, the effects of next-nearest
neighbour ﬁeld components have been ignored, as have all
more distant ﬁeld-ﬁeld interactions. In the next-nearest neigh-
bour case, the dropped terms would impose a rapid w b oscil-
lation onto the polarization r 12, which would in turn tend to
impose sidebands at ±w b onto each ﬁeld component.
It is
reasonable to ignore such sidebands in the narrowband limit
used for most applications of a multi-ﬁeld Raman theory; but,

in principle one might extend a multi-ﬁeld theory to include
them by inventing a scheme to apply the sidebands to the ﬁeld
component with which they are in nearest resonance.

Extra factors of 2 have appeared in eqns.(18, 19) because
the multi-ﬁeld equations start with double summations that
give pairs of terms that can be reduced to one in the remaining
single summation.

Finally, we need to insert the few-cycle correction to the
polarization term, because the ( j 6= 0) sub-envelopes A j have
an ı jw bt time dependence that cannot be neglected. The po-
larization correction terms are just the result of applying the
ﬁrst-order correction (ı/w 0)¶
t to the A(t)X(t) from eqn.(15).

IV. EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS

We now use the single-ﬁeld (GFEA) model to simulate an
experimental situation. First we compare the results to their
multi-ﬁeld counterparts, demonstrating the relationships be-
tween the two methods, and showing them to be in good
agreement, as expected for the chosen pulse lengths. Second,
we contrast our model with an (inaccurate) single-ﬁeld SVEA
model, in order to highlight the role of the few-cycle propa-
gation terms. The bulk of the code used was the same for all
simulations, as it contains options to switch from a single to a
multi-ﬁeld case, and to switch GFEA corrections on and off.
Figure 1 shows a set of results for a pair of pump pulses
traveling though 9cm of H2. This corresponds to a simula-
tion of an experiment where the pulses pump the 1st vib(ro)
level in molecular H2 (at 4155cm−1, i.e. ∼ 126THz), as in
the transient-regime experiments of Sali et.al. [4, 7]. In these
experiments, typical pulses might be 70fs and 250fs wide at
800nm (30µJ) and 600nm (120µJ) respectively, and the comb
of Raman sidebands generated are narrow and well separated.
A Cauchy-type dispersion curve for H2 is incorporated into
the simulations. In our simulations, we use the smaller widths
of 17.5fs and 62.5fs, which broadens the spectral peaks (to

about 57THz and 16THz respectively) and makes the stan-
dard multi-ﬁeld approach less practical. The ﬁgure compares
three data sets – (a) single-ﬁeld GFEA simulation, (b) multi-
ﬁeld simulation, and lastly (c) single-ﬁeld SVEA simulation
(i.e. without any few-cycle propagation corrections).

There is good agreement in the heights of all the spectral
peaks between the two exact simulations (single-ﬁeld GFEA
ﬁg. 1(a) and multi-ﬁeld ﬁg 1(b) ); even the details in the wings
of the ﬁrst anti-Stokes peak (at about f = 0.5) are replicated.
Those in the wings of the second anti-Stokes peak (at about
f = 0.63) are not well replicated; however, the features in
question are about three orders of magnitude weaker than the
peaks, and the two simulations are not equivalent because the
multi-ﬁeld theory does not include next-nearest neighbour in-
teractions.

The comparison between ﬁg. 1(a,b) and the single-ﬁeld
SVEA simulation ﬁg 1(c) is also instructive. Although it does
reproduce the character of the single-ﬁeld GFEA spectra in
many ways, the peak heights do not agree – a fact that is more
apparent on a linear scale than a logarithmic one. In terms of a
multi-ﬁeld model, we can say that without the GFEA correc-
tions, the prefactor of the polarization term does not pick up
its correct frequency dependence, so the Stokes lines are arti-
ﬁcially enhanced, and the anti-Stokes artiﬁcially suppressed.
Figure 2 shows a set of results from a single 10fs probe
pulse at 397nm, traveling though 9cm of previously polar-
ized D2. This corresponds to the probe stage of an experiment
where the gas had been prepared using a pair of nanosecond
ﬁelds resulting in a medium polarization of r 12 = 0.025ı on
the 2993.57cm−1 (∼ 90THz) vibrational transition, e.g. as in
the experiments of Gundry et.al. [13], who use a longer probe
pulse of about 150fs. A Cauchy-type dispersion curve is in-
corporated into the simulations, but in the absence of good
dispersion data for D2, we use that for H2 as it should be a
good match. Note that although the polarization initial con-
dition is ﬁxed, our simulations do incorporate the response of
the polarization to the probe pulses. The main spectral peaks
agree well in the multi-ﬁeld and single-ﬁeld GFEA simula-
tions, although as before the results differ at the edges where
the intensities are very small compared to the main features.
As for the previous situation, in the single-ﬁeld SVEA simula-
tion the Stokes and anti-Stokes lines are artiﬁcially enhanced
or suppressed.

FIG. 1: Transient Raman generation using 17.5fs and 62.5f pump
pulses as described in the text. Here we compares three simulation
results: (a) single-ﬁeld GFEA simulation, (b) multi-ﬁeld simulation,
and (c) single-ﬁeld SVEA simulation. The dashed lines help com-
pare the relative heights of the ﬁrst Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks.
The vertical scale is in arbitrary units.

V. DISCUSSION

For simple systems, those (for example) with a single Ra-
man transition driven by relatively long pulses, it will usu-
ally be most efﬁcient to continue using a multi-ﬁeld model.
Single-ﬁeld simulations require very ﬁne time-resolution, so
they are computationally expensive for pulses with many op-
tical cycles. The spectral range of the numerical ﬁeld is cor-
respondingly broad, typically covering many Stokes and anti-
Stokes lines.

In more complex situations, however, the single-ﬁeld ap-
proach will outperform its multi-ﬁeld counterpart. For exam-
ple, if a Raman interaction is probed by a beam that does not

lie on the frequency comb deﬁned by the pumping beams (e.g.
as in [13]), the multi-ﬁeld approach will become much more
complicated to implement. It will be necessary to deﬁne sepa-
rate arrays for the pump and probe Raman “ladders” of Stokes
and anti-Stokes lines, an issue that we avoided in section IV by
replacing the pump stage of the process with an initial condi-
tion for the polarization. With a single-ﬁeld model, the probe
pulse and its Raman sidebands simply get superimposed on
the overall spectrum, where they will be offset from the fre-
quency ladder deﬁned by the pump beams.

Another situation in which the multi-ﬁeld model will run
into difﬁculty is where there are multiple Raman resonances.
Although the treatment in this paper has been restricted to

4

if there are coupled multi-level interactions (as for example in
[14]). It is only necessary to describe those transitions appro-
priately, and to modify the polarization terms acting on the
propagating ﬁeld. This procedure is considerably more difﬁ-
cult to handle in the multi-ﬁeld case, which is based on ﬁeld
components separated by a particular Raman transition fre-
quency. Additional Raman resonances complicate the theory;
not only must extra detuning factors be added to the equa-
tions, but it is also necessary to work out which ﬁeld compo-
nent is nearest to each new driving term. With a wideband
single-ﬁeld model, on the other hand, any new sidebands or
resonance effects appear automatically in the spectrum, and
no special measures need to be adopted to handle them.

The usefulness of our single-ﬁeld approach is not restricted
to the Raman interaction described in this paper. It is not just
more easily extended to more complex Raman materials in-
volving e.g. multiple transitions than the standard multi-ﬁeld
model. It would be equally valuable for a near-degenerate op-
tical parametric oscillator, or indeed any system where two or
more ﬁeld components start to overlap as the pump or probe
pulses get shorter.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have considered how best to model the multi-frequency
ﬁeld in wideband Raman generation experiments. Rather than
using multiple ﬁeld envelopes, with one at each Stokes or anti-
Stokes frequency, we instead use a single wideband ﬁeld en-
velope. This requires that the ﬁeld be propagated taking into
account wideband effects, as described by either the SEWA
theory of Brabec and Krausz [11], or the more general GFEA
of Kinsler and New [8].

Our single-ﬁeld approach has three crucial advantages.
First, it includes more physics, even compared to a multi-ﬁeld
approach enhanced by adding GFEA corrections to the propa-
gation of the ﬁeld components. Secondly, it deals effortlessly
with the complications of overlapping spectra that occur in the
multi-ﬁeld case. Thirdly, it allows for extra Raman transitions,
and other molecular details to be included more easily than is
possible for the multi-ﬁeld model.

All of these factors ensure that our wideband single-ﬁeld
model not only extends the regime in which envelope-based
methods can be utilised; but is also more versatile and places
fewer restrictions on the kinds of Raman media that can be
easily described.

cal scale is in arbitrary units.

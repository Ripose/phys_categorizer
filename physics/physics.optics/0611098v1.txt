We theoretically and experimentally investigate the mutual collapse dynamics of two spatially
separated optical beams in a Kerr medium. Depending on the initial power, beam separation,
and the relative phase, we observe repulsion or attraction, which in the latter case reveals a sharp
transition to a single collapsing beam. This transition to fusion of the beams is accompanied by an
increase in the collapse distance, indicating the eﬀect of the nonlinear coupling on the individual
collapse dynamics. Our results shed light on the basic nonlinear interaction between self-focused
beams and provide a mechanism to control the collapse dynamics of such beams.

Nonlinear collapse to a singularity and the accompa-
nying richness of physical eﬀects is observed in several
ﬁelds of physics, such as optics [1], hydrodynamics [2],
and plasmas [3]. Self focusing and collapse of optical
beams with a power above a critical power Pcr [4] in
nonlinear Kerr media was ﬁrst predicted in the 1960’s
[5]. Over the past decade, with the advent of high peak
power ultra-short pulsed lasers, self-focusing dynamics
of optical beams have revealed a remarkable richness of
spatial and temporal nonlinear phenomena. These in-
clude observation of the universal self-similar spatial col-
lapse proﬁle known as the Townes proﬁle [6], multiple ﬁl-
amentation [7], self steepening and pulse splitting [8, 9],
multiphoton ionization, and supercontinuum generation
[9, 10], along with saturation and plasma generation that
typically arrest the collapse [11].

Related optical beam interactions within the context
of spatial solitons [12, 13] have drawn considerable in-
terest in recent years. Spatial solitons in 1D Kerr me-
dia are shown to interact in a particle-like elastic man-
ner, where the number of solitons and the correspond-
ing directions and propagation velocities are conserved
[12, 14]. Depending on the relative phase, attractive and
repulsive forces and power transfer are observed between
interacting solitons [15].
In saturable nonlinear media,
which can support (2+1)D solitons, phenomena such as
soliton fusion, ﬁssion, annihilation, and spiraling occur
[16, 17, 18, 19]. The interaction between incoherent soli-
tons, where the medium responds non-instantaneously,
exhibits similar eﬀects as those observed with coherent
solitons in nonlinear saturable media [20].

In the regime of optical beam collapse in a Kerr
medium, where self focusing is dominant and beams do
not maintain their spatial distribution, only a few theo-
retical studies of beam interactions have been reported
[21, 22, 23, 24], and to the best of our knowledge no
experiments have been performed. While in these ini-
tial theoretical studies several qualitative trends, such as
repulsion, attraction, and fusion of two beams, were iden-
tiﬁed, the detailed dynamics and the transition to fusion
of two beams, especially when each beam has a power
near Pcr, has not been explored.

In this Letter, we investigate both theoretically and
experimentally the spatial collapse dynamics of two co-
herently coupled beams in Kerr media. We observe re-
pulsion and attraction between the collapsing beams, and
a sharp transition to fusion of the beams, which is depen-
dent on their initial power, spatial separation and relative
phase. We further show that this transition, accompa-
nied by a peak in the collapse distance, can be exploited
to control and manipulate the collapse dynamics of two
coupled beams. Our results shed light on the basic non-
linear interaction between self-focused collapsing beams
and are applicable in diﬀerent scenarios, including that
of multiple ﬁlamentation and collapse of complex multi-
lobe beams such as necklace beams [25].

To investigate the propagation and collapse of two spa-
tially separated beams in Kerr media, we numerically
integrate the scalar (2+1)D nonlinear Schr¨odinger equa-
tion (NLSE), neglecting dispersion and high-order terms.
These assumptions are reasonable as long as the disper-
sion length is longer than the nonlinear and diﬀraction
length scales. We express the (2+1)D NLSE in normal-
ized units as

where ψ is proportional to the amplitude A(x, y, z) =

than Pcr = α(λ2/4πn0n2), where α is a constant that
depends on the initial spatial proﬁle [4], the self-focusing
term dominates and the beam undergoes collapse.

In the present study, we assume an initial ﬁeld com-

posed of two spatially separated, parallel, Gaussian
beams of the form ψ(µ, ν, 0) = C{e−[(µ−∆0/2)
] +
eiϕe−[(µ+∆0/2)
]}, where ∆0 is the normalized initial
spatial separation of the beams, ϕ is the relative phase
between the beams, and C is a normalization constant
that depends on the total power. To exclude cases where
the two beams are initially unresolvable and hence col-
lapse as a single beam, we assume ∆0 > 1. Since a col-
lapsing Gaussian beam is known to form a Townes distri-
bution carrying one critical power [6], we limit our inves-
tigation to the regime of powers 2Pcr < P < 10Pcr. This
corresponds to powers Pcr < PG < 5Pcr for each beam,
thus enabling their individual collapse, but restricts the
collapse distance to be larger than 0.25Ldf .

For a ﬁxed total power of 2.5Pcr, various initial separa-
tions ∆0, and for a relative phase of either 0 or π (in- and
out-of-phase cases), we integrate Eq. (1) with the split-
step method and obtain the intensity distribution as a
function of ζ. Just before collapse, when the peak inten-
sity reaches 50 times the initial peak intensity, we record
the ζ value and the separation between the two collaps-
ing peaks. The distance between the collapse points ∆col
and the collapse distance ζcol as functions of the initial
separation are shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively.
When the separation is large, for both the in- and out-
of phase cases, the collapse dynamics of each beam are
essentially independent of the other beam, and the dis-
tance between the collapse points is equal to the initial
separation. For the in-phase case, as the initial sepa-
ration is decreased the collapsing beams are attracted
towards each other, and their separation decreases with
respect to the initial separation. At some critical separa-
tion (∆0 ≈ 1.9) a sharp transition to one collapsing beam
is observed. This transition to fusion of the two beams is
accompanied by more than a 40% increase in the collapse
distance with respect to independent beam collapse. The
lengthening of collapse distance represents a critical slow-
ing down, associated with the phase transition between
independent collapse and fusion. For the out-of-phase
case the behavior is drastically diﬀerent. When the initial
separation is decreased the collapsing beams repel each
other and do not undergo fusion to a single collapsing
point. This resembles the well-known repulsion observed
between two anti-phased spatial solitons [12]. Here the
collapse distance is decreased with regard to independent
beam collapse.

We further investigate for the in-phase case the depen-
dence of the above transition on the total power. Fig-
ure 1(c) shows the distance between collapse points as
a function of initial separation for diﬀerent total pow-
ers. As the total power is decreased, approaching 2Pcr
(i.e. one critical power per beam), the critical separation
at which the transition occurs increases, and the transi-
tion becomes steeper. With a total power of 2.02Pcr, the
critical separation is almost three times that for a total
power of 10Pcr. As P → Pcr, the distance to collapse is

extended, allowing for longer lengths of mutual attrac-
tion and eventually for fusion into one beam (e.g. with a
total power of 2.5Pcr the independent collapse distance
is 1.4Ldf while with 2.02Pcr it is 7Ldf , and is more than
doubled at the transition region to 18Ldf ). At relatively
large total powers, the transition occurs at smaller initial
separations, such that the beams appear to be decoupled
for most initial separations. Unlike the case of soliton in-
teractions, these dynamics are governed simultaneously
individual beam collapse
by two competing processes:
and fusion of the beams.

To experimentally investigate the collapse dynamics of
this system, we use the arrangement schematically shown
in Fig. 2. A pulsed, Ti:Sapphire ampliﬁed laser beam,
with 1-kHz, 90-fs pulses centered at 800 nm, is passed
through a spatial ﬁlter to obtain a nearly Gaussian pro-
ﬁle. This beam is sent into a two-arm interferometer,

Initially, one arm is blocked, and the laser power is ad-
justed so that collapse of a single beam is obtained at the
output face of the BK7 rod. The energy per pulse is mea-
sured to be 3.6 µJ, equivalent to 40 MW, which is about a
factor of 10 higher than expected from the CW numerical
calculations for collapse after 0.56Ldf in BK7 glass. We
attribute this discrepancy in powers mainly to dispersive
eﬀects in the long glass rod and ﬁnd that this translates
into merely a scaling factor for the power and does not
aﬀect signiﬁcantly the spatial dynamics under investiga-
tion. This power, at which collapse of a single beam
is observed at the output, is held constant throughout
 
the experiments. In practice, due to coherent overlap of
the beams on the beam splitter, the total power slightly
increased as their separation is decreased. For beam sep-
arations greater than 1.5ω0 this increase is calculated to
be less than 32%.

composed of a 50:50 beam splitter and two retro reﬂec-
tors, such that the two spatially separated beams can
be recombined at the same beam splitter. The separa-
tion of the two beams is changed by moving one of the
retro reﬂectors in the transverse direction. The tempo-
ral alignment needed for coherently combining two short
pulses and for controlling their relative phase is achieved
by changing the length of one arm with a high-precision
motorized stage. The combined beams emerging from
the interferometric setup are telescoped down to obtain
a 0.29-mm beam waist (ω0) and then sent into a 28-cm
rod of BK7 glass (equivalent to 0.56Ldf ). The intensity
distribution at the input and output faces of the BK7 rod
are imaged onto a 12-bit CCD camera. In order to mon-
itor the relative phase of the two combined beams, the
far-ﬁeld intensity fringes of the input ﬁeld distribution
 
are imaged onto an additional CCD camera.

After setting the power, we unblock the two arms and
for each initial separation of the two beams we record the
input and output intensity distributions. This is done for
the case in which the beams are temporally misaligned
(i.e. the independent beam case) and for both the in- and
out-of-phase cases, where the relative phase is zero and
π, respectively. Several representative intensity distribu-

tions for diﬀerent initial separations and relative phase
are shown in Fig. 3. For the in-phase case, the observed
behavior is in agreement with our simulations in which
two collapsing points occur at the output when the ini-
tial separation is large, whereas only one collapse point is
seen when the initial separation is small. This is a clear
indication of predicted attraction and fusion between two
collapsing in-phase beams. For the out-of-phase case, two
collapsing points are always observed at the output, in-
dicating repulsion between the collapsing beams, which
is also in agreement with our theoretical results.

From the recorded intensity distributions, we measure
the initial separation between the beams at the input
face and the corresponding separation between the col-
lapse points at the output face, and the results are plotted
in Fig. 4. As expected from the numerical calculations,
attraction between the beams and a sharp transition to
a single collapse point is observed for the in-phase case.
This occurs at a separation distance of 1.75ω0, corre-
sponding to the numerical calculations with Ptotal ≈ 4Pcr
[see Fig. 1(c)], which is in good agreement with the col-
lapse distance. For the out-of-phase case, the beams re-
pel each other, and the separation between the collapse
points does not decrease below 0.52 mm, which is equal
to 1.8ω0.

In order to experimentally test our ability to dynami-
cally control the collapse of two coupled beams via their
relative phase, we slowly sweep the time overlap of the
two beams (near the optimal overlap point), thus chang-

ing their relative phase periodically. This is performed for
two diﬀerent initial separations, the ﬁrst at a separation
of 0.41 mm corresponding to 1.4ω0 where the in-phase
case results in fusion into one collapse point, and the sec-
ond at a separation of 0.54 mm corresponding to 1.86ω0
where the distance between the two collapse points is
signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the relative phase. In the ﬁrst
case the output distribution oscillates between two dis-
In
tinct states with either one or two collapse points.
the second case, the output distribution always has two
collapse points, for which the separation increases and
decreases periodically. When the relative phase is in the
intermediate state (neither 0 or π), the power appears to
redistribute between the collapse points in an analogous
way to that observed in 1D soliton experiments [13].

In conclusion, we have investigated the collapse dy-
namics of two spatially separated coupled beams in a
Kerr medium. For the in-phase case, we experimentally
observe a sharp transition to fusion of the two collaps-
ing beams, which depends on the initial separation and
power. We predict that this transition is accompanied
by a longer collapse distance with respect to indepen-
dent collapse. For the out-of-phase case, the beams repel
each other and collapse independently. Our results of
two-beam interaction serve as a basis for analyzing more
complicated scenarios where multiple beams or compos-
ite multi-lobe beams undergo self focusing and collapse.

Abstract

We investigate theoretically a ﬁber laser passively mode-locked with non-
linear polarization rotation. A unidirectional ring cavity is considered with
a polarizer placed between two sets of a halfwave plate and a quarterwave
plate. A master equation is derived and the stability of the continuous and
mode-locked solutions is studied. In particular, the eﬀect of the orientation
of the four phase plates and of the polarizer on the mode-locking regime is
investigated.

1 Introduction

Passively mode-locked ﬁber lasers are of great importance for various applica-
tions involving optical telecommunications. Diﬀerent experimental methods
have been used to achieve mode-locking operation [1]-[11]. In this paper we
are interested in mode-locking through nonlinear polarization rotation. This
technique has been successfully used to obtain short pulse generation in dif-
ferent rare-earth doped ﬁber lasers [3]-[5],[12]-[15] and is self-starting. The
laser conﬁguration is a unidirectional ﬁber ring cavity containing a polarizer
placed between two polarization controllers. The polarization state evolves
nonlinearly in the ﬁber as a result of the optical Kerr eﬀect. If the polar-
ization controllers are suitably oriented, the polarizer lets pass the central
intense part of a pulse while it blocks the low intensity wings.

Diﬀerent theoretical approaches have been developed to describe the
mode-locking properties of such laser. Haus et al. [1, 2] have developed a
model based on the addition of the diﬀerent eﬀects assuming that all eﬀects
are small over one round-trip of the cavity. Analytical studies of Akhmediev
et al. [16, 17] are based on a normalized complex cubic Ginzburg-Landau
(CGL) equation and give the stability conditions of the mode-locked solu-
tions. On the other hand, many numerical simulations have been done to
complete analytic approaches [18]-[20]. We have recently investigated ex-
perimentally and theoretically the mode-locking properties of an Yb-doped
double clad ﬁber laser passively mode-locked through nonlinear polarization
rotation [12, 21]. The optical conﬁguration was a unidirectional ring cavity
containing an optical isolator placed between two halfwave plates. Only two
phase plates were considered for simplicity. The theoretical model reduces
to a complex cubic Ginzburg-Landau equation whose coeﬃcients explicitly
depend on the orientation of the phase plates. The model allowed the de-
scription of both the self-starting mode-locking operation and the operating
regimes as a function of the orientation of the halfwave plates. The model
was then adapted to the anomalous dispersion case [22] and to the stretched-
pulse operation [23]. Although our simpliﬁed model is in good agreement
with the experimental results, a typical experiment includes two polariza-
tion controllers instead of two halfwave plates. Indeed, mode-locking is more
easily obtained in the former case because there is more degrees of freedom.
The aim of this paper is to provide a general model taking into account a
polarizer and two sets of a halfwave plate and a quarterwave plate. The pa-
per is organized as follows. In section 2 we derive a propagation equation for

a unidirectional ring cavity containing a polarizer placed between two sets
of a halfwave and a quarterwave plates. The resulting equation, valid for
a large number of round trips, is of the CGL type and explicitly takes into
account the orientation of the phase plates and the polarizer. Constant and
mode-locked solutions are considered in section 3. The last section is devoted
to a discussion of the inﬂuence of the phase plates and of the polarizer on
the stability of both the mode-locking and the continuous wave regimes of
the laser.

In this section we derive a master equation for the laser shown in ﬁgure 1.
The ytterbium-doped ﬁber has gain, birefringence, group velocity dispersion
(GVD) and optical Kerr nonlinearity. The cavity contains a polarizing iso-
lator placed between two polarization controllers.

Following our analysis of reference [12], we assume that the eﬀects of the

over one round-trip of the cavity. A perturbative approach can be used. We
introduce a small parameter ε and replace the quantities β2, γ and ρ by εβ2,

the ytterbium-doped ﬁber, and (u(L), v(L)) the components at the exit of
the ﬁber of length L. A ﬁrst order perturbative calculation leads to [12, 22]

2.2 Modelling the phase plates and the polarizer

(cid:0)

The Jones matrix formalism is well adapted to the treatment of a combination
of phase plates and polarizer. It will be used in this section. Without loss of
generality, we assume that the eigenaxis at both ends of the ﬁber are aligned
and parallel to the x and y-axes of the laboratory frame. Let α1 (resp. α4)

the angle between the eigenaxis of the halfwave plate and the x-axis before
(resp. after) the polarizer. Let α2 (resp. α3) the angle between the eigenaxis
of the quarterwave plate and the x-axis before (resp. after) the polarizer.
Let θ the angle between the passing axis of the polarizer and the x-axis.

In the framework of their eigenaxis, the Jones matrices of the quarterwave

allow to investigate the operating regime of the laser as a function of the
orientation of the phase plates and of the polarizer.

It is more convenient to describe the evolution of the ﬁeld amplitude fn by a
continuous equation. The discrete sequence fn is interpolated by a continuous

3 Solution of the CGL equation

This section is devoted to the study of two particular solutions of equa-
tion (18). We ﬁrst consider the constant solution corresponding to a contin-
uous wave (CW) operating regime of the laser. Localized solutions are then
considered and are related to the mode-locking regime of the laser. In both
cases, the stability criterium of the solution is determined.

4 Inﬂuence of the orientations of the phase

plates and of the polarizer

In the previous section we have derived a master equation for a laser passively
mode-locked by nonlinear polarization rotation. The coeﬃcients of the equa-
tion depend on the orientation angles of the phase plates α1, α2, α3, α4, and
of the polarizer θ. As a consequence, the stability of both the continuous and
the mode-locked solutions also depends on these angles. Because of the large
number of degrees of freedom, we cannot perform a systematic study of the
stability of the solutions as a function of the ﬁve angles. In the following we
have generally ﬁxed three angles and varied the two remaining ones. In these
conditions it is convenient to summarize the results in a two dimensional
stability diagram which gives for any couple of varying angles the regions
of stability of both the continuous and the mode-locked solutions. We have
ﬁrst considered (θ, α2, α3) = (θ, 0◦, 0◦) where θ takes the following values: 0◦,
30◦, 45◦, 60◦, 90◦, 120◦, 135◦, 150◦, and 180◦. We have plotted the stability
diagram in the plane (α1, α4) for each value of θ. The same studies have been
done for (θ, α2, α3) = (0◦, α2, 0◦), (0◦, 0◦, α3), (30◦, 30◦, 30◦), (45◦, 120◦, 150◦),
and (60◦, 30◦, 135◦). In the two ﬁrst cases, α2 and α3 take the same values
as attributed to θ. For the numerical computations, we have used the same
parameters as in ref. [12]: K = 1.5 m−1, β2 = 0.026 ps2m−1, L = 9 m and
γ = 3

10−3 W−1m−1.

·

A great dependance of the stability domains versus α1, α2, α3, α4, and
θ have been observed. This can be physically expected because a change
in the orientation of one element leads to a relative variation of the losses
undergo by the wings and the center of the pulse. It is then possible either
to favor the center of the pulse which travels the polarizer with a minimum

8

losses, leading to eﬃcient mode-locking regime, or to favor the opposite case
resulting in the instability of the mode-locking regime. These results are

and (0◦, 0◦, 45◦), respectively. The representations have been limited to 0◦ 6

reference [12] where only two halfwave plates were considered. This is correct
because the polarizer is aligned with the eigenaxis of the two quarterwave
plates. Thus this result validates the general model including four phase
plates. A large part of the computed cartographies are relatively close to
ﬁgure 2, but another typical shape is shown on ﬁgure 3. Figures 4 and 5
show that the operating regime can be independent of the orientation of one

of the halfwave plates. We can note on ﬁgure 5 that the orientation of the
last half wave plate (α4) does not modify the stability of the solutions in this
case. This is not surprising since for θ = 0◦ and α3 = 45◦, the polarization
that enters this last half wave plate is circular. Whatever the orientation of
this plate, the polarization entering the ﬁber is thus circular, and the global
behavior does not depend on α4. This further allows to give a physical
interpretation to the absence of any mode-locking domain in this case. We
can see from relations (3) and (4) that in absence of birefringence (K = 0),
if a circular polarization enters the ﬁber, a circular polarization exits the
ﬁber. Actually, nonlinear polarization rotation does not occur. We can thus
assume that this is the reason why no mode-locking regime is predicted here.
We have then explored the dependency of the operating regimes of the
laser with respect to the orientation angles (α2, α3) of the quarterwave plates.
The periodicity versus α2 and α3 is 180◦. Figures 6, 7 and 8 give typ-

(θ, α1, α4) = (0◦, 0◦, 0◦), (0◦, 30◦, 0◦), and (60◦, 30◦, 135◦) of the polarizer and
halfwave plates. We can note the large regions of instability and also the in-
creased number of mode-locking regions compared to the reference results of
ﬁgure 2, especially on ﬁgure 8. It is interesting to point out the existence of
four horizontal axes that separate abruptly the diﬀerent domains and where
no mode-locking is observed. They locate at values of α3 about integer mul-
tiples of 45◦, on ﬁgures 6-7, and around 15◦, 45◦, 105◦ and 135◦ on ﬁgure 8.
In the latter case, θ = 60◦, while it is zero in the former. We can thus deduce
that for α3 = 60◦
45◦, polarization exiting the plate no3 is circular, which
is not modiﬁed by the last plate no4 (λ/2). As previously, we can assume
that nonlinear polarization rotation does not occur such that mode-locking
is not observed. These cases correspond indeed to the horizontal axes where
α3 is around 45◦ or 135◦ on ﬁgures 6-7, 15◦ or 105◦ on ﬁgure 8. In addition,
these axes appear as boundaries: when α3 passes through these axes, the
ratio between the x-polarized and the y-polarized components entering the
ﬁber passes unity, “inverting” the eﬀect of nonlinear polarization rotation
and thus on mode-locking or CW operation. We have checked with other

values of θ the existence of similar horizontal axes at α3 = θ
separate abruptly mode-locking and CW domains and where mode-locking
does not occur in general. Other axes, around α3 = 0◦ and 90◦ on ﬁgures 6-7
or 45◦ and 135◦ on ﬁgure 8, can be interpreted with similar arguments. The
eigenaxes of this plate are then parallel to those of wave plate no4 (α4 = 0◦ in
the former case, 135◦ in the latter). Then the polarization entering the ﬁber
is in general elliptical, but with its high-axis oriented at 45◦ from the x-axis
and y-axis of the ﬁber. The maximum of x and y amplitudes in the ﬁber are
thus identical and we can assume that nonlinear polarization rotation is not
eﬃcient. To conﬁrm this assumption, we have plotted another cartography
in the (α2, α3) plane with the same parameters: θ = 30◦ and α1 = 30◦, but
with α4 = 120◦ (not drawn here). In this case, two horizontal axes without
any mode-locking are located at α3 = 15◦ and 105◦ instead of 45◦ and 135◦.
These axes correspond to orientations such that the polarization entering the
ﬁber is elliptical with its high-axis oriented at 45◦ of the x-axis and y-axis of
the ﬁber. This is thus similar to previous cases with α4 = 0◦ or 135◦ and we
can understand that no ML occurs for these two horizontal axes. Note that in

this case, two other axes are observed for α3 near 75◦ and 165◦. Polarization
exiting the plate n◦3 is then circular, which is not modiﬁed by the last plate
n◦4. Nonlinear polarization rotation is then very diﬃcult to be obtained, as
already mentioned.

We have seen that it is possible to give some physical interpretations
concerning the inﬂuence of parameters α3 and α4, located just before the
ﬁber. Polarization states can then be well understood since these elements are
located just after the polarizer. In contrast, it is very diﬃcult to interpret the
inﬂuence of parameters α1 and α2 located at the exit of the ﬁber. Inﬂuence
of these parameters depends indeed strongly on polarization eﬀects induced
in the ﬁber, which are not directly accessible. Experimentally the role of
phase plates n◦1 and n◦2 is essential because they allow the adjustment
of the polarization state of the incident electric ﬁeld at the entrance of the
polarizer, in such a way that the central part of the pulse is transmitted while
the wings are blocked. However no quantitative description of the inﬂuence
of the orientation of phase plates n◦1 and n◦2 has been found, due to the
high complexity of the nonlinear dynamics. We but point out their key role.
Let us now consider the inﬂuence of the orientation of the polarizer θ on

the operating regimes of the laser for ﬁxed orientations of the phase plates.
Some diagrams are represented in ﬁgure 9 for (α1, α2, α3, α4) = (0◦, 0◦, 0◦, 0◦)
(a), (30◦, 45◦, 120◦, 150◦) (b), and (30◦, 0◦, 0◦, 30◦) (c). We can note on these
ﬁgures and also on many diagrams not reported here that for any values
of the orientations of the phase plates, mode-locking can be achieved by a
rotation of the polarizer.

In summary, although some behaviors can be well interpreted, it is very
diﬃcult to deduce general trends for the mode-locking properties of the laser
essentially because of the large number of variable parameters. However, the
model is a very powerful tool to predict the behavior of the laser.

5 Conclusion

In conclusion we have developed a general model for a ﬁber laser passively
mode-locked by nonlinear polarization rotation. A unidirectional ring cavity
containing a polarizer placed between two sets of a halfwave and a quarter-
wave plates each has been considered. Starting from two coupled nonlinear

Stability of

propagation equations for the electric ﬁeld components we have derived a
unique equation for the ﬁeld amplitude, which is a complex cubic Ginzburg
Landau equation. The coeﬃcients of the equation depend explicitly on the
orientation angles of the polarizer and of the phase plates. We have thus
investigated the stability of both the constant amplitude and the short-pulse
solutions as a function of the angles. Solutions have been found analytically.

Although it is diﬃcult to give some general trends, the model has the ad-
vantage to describe a real experiment.
Indeed, it includes the linear and
nonlinear characteristics of the doped ﬁber, two polarization controllers and
a polarizer.

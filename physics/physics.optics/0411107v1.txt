Pump-probe differencing technique for
cavity-enhanced, noise-canceling saturation laser
spectroscopy

Abstract— We present an experimental technique enabling
mechanical-noise free, cavity-enhanced frequency measurements
of an atomic transition and its hyperﬁne structure. We employ the
532nm frequency doubled output from a Nd:YAG laser and an
iodine vapour cell. The cell is placed in a traveling-wave Fabry-
Perot interferometer (FPI) with counter-propagating pump and
probe beams. The FPI is locked using the Pound-Drever-Hall
(PDH) technique. Mechanical noise is rejected by differencing
pump and probe signals. In addition, this differenced error signal
gives a sensitive measure of differential non-linearity within the
FPI.

Fabry-Perot interferometers provide an obvious means of
amplifying the response of weak atomic transitions [1]. The
interferometer bounce number yields the effective increase in
interaction length given by the FPI [2]. However, this inter-
ferometric improvement necessarily couples laser frequency
noise and mechanical noise of the interferometer into the
measurement. This places stringent requirements on the free
running frequency noise of the interrogating laser as well as
the acoustic and seismic isolation required for interferometer
operation.

To address these issues the NICE-OHMS [3] technique
provides a cavity enhanced technique that gives immunity to
both laser frequency noise and interferometer mechanical noise
whilst realising cavity enhanced sensitivity. NICE-OHMS
achieves this by using phase modulation (PM) at the free
spectral range (FSR) of the interferometer in order to probe the
refractive index changes around the FPI resonance experienced
by the laser carrier electric ﬁeld. The PM sidebands resonate
in adjacent FPI modes and experience an identical response
to both frequency noise of the laser and cavity mechanical
noise as does the carrier (coming from the same laser and in-
terrogating the same cavity). The identical response preserves
PM symmetry and provides noise immunity. A second, non-
resonant PM is required to lock the laser carrier to a FPI
resonance whilst dual FM demodulation is required to lock the
RF source dynamically to the FPI FSR. A third low frequency
modulation is applied to the FPI in order to give a signal
proportional to the derivative signal, yielding a noise immune
output proportional to the atomic transition being measured.
Here we introduce a new technique that provides both cavity
enhanced sensitivity and noise immunity in a far simpler
experimental conﬁguration. Furthermore, our technique also

provides a new and sensitive measure of the differential non-
linearity of low loss optical media.

Our cavity-enhanced technique uses a travelling-wave FPI
which is interrogated in both directions (see ﬁgure 1). The
laser beam, prior to pump/probe split off, is phase modulated
at a high RF frequency. This ensures that the phase modulation
is identical for both the pump and the probe and any residual
amplitude modulation (AM) caused by the modulator appears
equally on both beams. The pump beam interrogates the cavity
and the reﬂected beam is incident on an RF photodetector
prior to demodulation. This yields the PDH [4] error signal
for the pump mode relative to the laser frequency. The probe
beam is also reﬂected onto its own RF photodetector. The
RF signals from the pump and probe are then differenced
on a 180o RF splitter/combiner prior to demodulation. By
balancing the RF signal power of the pump relative to the
probe, prior to subtraction and demodulation, it is possible
to cancel out the error signal resulting from cavity detuning,
including mechanical FPI noise, as this is common to both.

The demodulated PDH pump error signal is used to lock
the ring cavity to the laser frequency while the demodulated
difference output then yields the differential phase response
between the pump and probe beams. As the probe beam is
far weaker than the pump beam, the shot noise limit of the
subtracted output is effectively given by the probe sensitivity
alone. Day et al [5] calculate the shot noise limited frequency
sensitivity of the PDH error signal as:

tector responsivity, η, of 0.4 Amperes/Watt at a wavelength,
λ, of 532nm gives a shot noise limited frequency sensitivity
of 0.13 Hz/√Hz.

Figure 1 shows a simpliﬁed schematic of our experimental
set up. We use the doubled output of a Prometheus (INNO-
20mW at 532nm) to provide both the
LIGHT GmbH) laser (
pump and probe beams for our experiment. After optical isola-
tion, the laser output is phase modulated at 65MHz (NewFocus
4002). The mode matching optics are then traversed prior to
splitting the pump (8.7mW) and probe (0.45mW) beams. The
pump and probe beams then interrogate the ring cavity in
different directions. The FPI consists of a 7% input coupler,
two high reﬂector mirrors and a 2% output coupler giving
67, ignoring intra cavity losses. The
a nominal ﬁnesse of
reﬂected pump beam is incident on PD3 while the reﬂected
probe beam is incident on PD4. The RF output of the pump
photodetector is split with one output being demodulated to
derive a PDH error signal that is then fed back to the cavity
PZT mirror in order to lock the ring cavity to the laser
frequency. The other RF splitter output is then attenuated and
subtracted from the RF probe photodetector output (PD4) prior
to being demodulated. This subtracted output can then be used
to both detect weak atomic transitions as well as provide an
error signal to lock the laser to a hyperﬁne transition.

In order to balance the subtraction error signal, the iodine
cell was removed from the cavity and the PZT mirror used
to scan the cavity resonance across the frequency of the
doubled laser output. Figure 2a shows the transmitted powers
of both the pump and probe beams. Figure 2b shows the
corresponding error signals at the subtracted output. The pump
error signal is recorded with the probe detector (PD4) blocked
while the probe error signal is recorded with the pump detector
(PD3) blocked. After electronic balancing, using the variable
attenuator, the subtracted error signal shown in ﬁgure 2c was
obtained. While trace 2c is clearly nonzero away from cavity
resonance, the ﬂat error signal through resonance indicates that
when locked, this output is insensitive to cavity displacement.
After replacing the iodine cell, the FPI was once again

scanned across the frequency of the doubled laser output.
Traces 3a(i) and 3b(i) show the cavity transmitted power for
the pump and probe respectively when the laser frequency
is approximately 6GHz detuned from the R(56)32-0 iodine
atomic transition. In this regime the atomic absorption, both
linear and non-linear, is negligible and the ratio of pump to
probe transmitted power is approximately equal to the splitter
ratio (19:1). Traces 3a(ii) and 3b(ii) show the transmitted
power of the pump and probe when the laser is tuned near
the centre of the R(56)32-0 resonance. Clearly the pump
beam suffers only minor attenuation while the probe beam is
nearly completely absorbed. This differential bleaching of the
pump/probe beams causes a signiﬁcant difference in ﬁnesse
seen by the pump and probe beams on reﬂection of the
FPI. The ﬁnesse difference unbalances the subtracted error
signal generating the response shown by trace 3c(ii). The error
signal slope across resonance yields a direct measure of the
differential non-linearity in the intra-cavity iodine cell.

cancellation of greater than 60dB (trace 5a(ii)). In addition,
this error signal is also free from the residual low frequency
acoustic noise visible on the pump error signal spectrum.

Figure 5b demonstrates that when operating at the centre
of the R(56)32-0 a1 hyperﬁne resonance, the subtracted error
signal responds to a deliberate laser frequency modulation
at 40kHz even though it rejects mechanical noise; the in-
troduced 30kHz mechanical signal is absent as is the low
frequency residual noise. Hence the locked cavity subtracted
error signal discriminates between laser frequency noise and
mechanical/acoustic noise, making this error signal an ideal
optical frequency reference.

is then scanned across the Doppler broadened R(56)32-0
transition. Traces 4a and 4b show the transmitted power of the
pump and probe beams, respectively. Due to cross saturation
inside the iodine cell, the probe transmission exhibits inverted
lamb dips at the hyperﬁne transition frequencies. The cavity
bounce number enhances the size of these inverted lamb dips
showing clearly deﬁned features. Trace 4c shows the output
of the subtracted error signal. At every hyperﬁne transition
there is a clear error signal due to the differential phase
response of the inverted lamb dips seen only by the probe
beam. Trace 4c is recorded with a large intra-cavity pump
power of approximately 71mW and shows substantial power
broadening, leaving several hyperﬁne pairs unresolved. Even
so, the subtracted and demodulated output demonstrates a clear
ability to lock the frequency of the laser to any of the well
deﬁned error signals. Trace 4d shows a detailed scan of the
R(56)32-0 a1 hyperﬁne error signal, chosen for its relative
isolation, simplicity and large size.

With the ring cavity still locked and the laser frequency
tuned to sit at the centre of the a1 hyperﬁne resonance, we
introduced a large 30kHz mechanical signal to the interferom-
eter via the PZT mirror. This produces a large signal clearly
visible in the pump error signal spectrum of ﬁgure 5a(i). The
cavity locking servo for the pump PDH error signal has a
unity gain bandwidth of approximately 7kHz, a simple 1/f
response below unity gain frequency and a third order, low
pass, elliptic ﬁlter above the unity gain frequency . This
ensures that the signal injected at 30kHz is free from servo
effects and remains unsuppressed while FPI mechanical noise
below 7kHz is suppressed by approximately the inverse of the
loop gain. The subtracted error signal however, completely
removes this 30kHz signal demonstrating mechanical noise

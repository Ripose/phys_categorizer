Linear defect modes in one-dimensional photonic lattices are studied theoretically. For negative
(repulsive) defects, various localized defect modes are found. The strongest conﬁnement of the
defect modes appear when the lattice intensity at the defect site is non-zero rather than zero. When
launched at small angles into such a defect site of the lattice, a Gaussian beam can be trapped and
undergo snake oscillations under appropriate conditions. OCIS numbers: 190.5530, 230.3990.

Light propagation in periodic photonic lattices is under
intensive study these days due to their novel physics and
light-routing applications [1,2]. Most of these studies fo-
cused on nonlinear light behaviors in uniformly periodic
lattices [3–10]. A natural question arises: how does light
propagate if the photonic lattice has a local defect? In
photonic crystals, this question has been much analyzed
[11]. While nonuniform arrays of ”fabricated” waveg-
uides with structured defects were used in previous stud-
ies [12–14], the issue of defect modes in optically-induced
photonic lattices has not yet received much attention.
Since photonic lattices diﬀer from photonic crystals on
many aspects (for instance, the refractive-index variation
in an induced photonic lattice is typically several orders
of magnitude smaller than that in a photonic crystal),
one wonders if photonic lattices with a local defect can
also support defect modes.

In this Letter, we theoretically analyze linear defect
modes in one-dimensional photonic lattices with a local
negative defect as induced in a biased photorefractive
crystal.
In such a defect, the lattice intensity is lower
than that at nearby sites (akin to an ”air defect” in pho-
tonic crystals [11]), thus light has a tendency to escape
from the defect to nearby sites. However, we found that
localized defect modes do exist due to repeated Bragg
reﬂections. More interestingly, strongly conﬁned defect
modes appear when the lattice intensity at the defect
site is non-zero rather than zero. As the lattice poten-
tial increases (by raising the bias ﬁeld), defect modes
move from lower bandgaps to higher ones. If a Gaussian
beam is launched at small angles into the defect, it can
be trapped and undergo robust snake oscillations inside
the defect site without much radiation.

The physical situation we consider here is that an or-
dinarily polarized lattice beam with a single-site neg-
ative defect is launched into a photorefractive crystal.
This defected lattice beam is assumed to be uniform
along the direction of propagation. Meanwhile, an extra-
ordinarily polarized probe beam with a very low intensity
is launched into the defect site, propagating collinearly
with the lattice beam. The non-dimensionalized model
equation for the probe beam is [5]

iUz + Uxx −

E0
1 + IL(x)

U = 0.

(1)

0n4

Here U is the slowly-varying amplitude of the probe
beam, z is the propagation distance (in units of
2k1D2/π2), x is the transverse distance (in units of D/π),
E0 is the applied DC ﬁeld [in units of π2/(k2
eD2r33)],
IL = I0 cos2 x {1 + ǫfD(x)} is the intensity function of
the photorefractive lattice (normalized by the dark irra-
diance of the crystal Id), I0 is the peak intensity of the
otherwise uniform photonic lattice (i.e., far away from the
defect site), fD(x) is a localized function describing the
shape of the defect, ǫ controls the strength of the defect,
D is the lattice spacing, k0 = 2π/λ0 is the wavenumber
(λ0 is the wavelength), k1 = k0ne, ne is the unperturbed
refractive index, and r33 is the electro-optic coeﬃcient
of the crystal.
In this letter, we assume that the de-
fect is restricted to a single lattice site at x = 0. Thus,
we take fD(x) = exp(−x8/128). Other choices of defect
functions fD give similar results. When ǫ < 0, the light
intensity IL at the defect site is lower than that at the
surrounding sites. This is called a negative (repulsive)
defect where light tends to escape to nearby lattice sites.
For ǫ = −1 and −0.5, the corresponding lattice intensity
proﬁles are displayed in Figs. 1a and 3b respectively.
In the former case, there is no light at the defect site,
while in the latter case, there is still light at the defect
site but with a halfway reduced intensity. These lattices
with structured defects might be generated experimen-
tally by optical induction. Consistent with our previous
experiments [7], we choose parameters as follows: the
lattice intensity I0 = 3Id, lattice spacing D = 20µm,
λ0 = 0.5µm, ne = 2.3, and r33 = 280pm/V. Then one
x unit corresponds to 6.4µm, one z unit corresponds to
2.3 mm, and one E0 unit corresponds to 20 V/mm in
physical units.

For a negative defect, a surprising feature is the pos-
sible existence of localized defect modes due to repeated
Bragg reﬂections. The existence of such modes will af-
fect light propagation in a profound way. We seek such
modes in the form U (x, z) = e−iµzu(x), where function
u(x) is localized in x, and µ is a propagation constant.
Our numerical method is to expand the solution u(x)
into discrete Fourier series, then converting the linear

1

u(x) equation into an eigenvalue problem with µ as the
eigenvalue. First, we consider the defect with ǫ = −1,
where the lattice intensity at the defect is zero (see Fig.
1a). For this defect, we have found defect modes at vari-
ous values of E0. The results are shown in Fig. 1b. It is
seen that at low values of E0 (low potential), two defect
modes appear in the ﬁrst and second bandgaps. The one
in the ﬁrst bandgap is symmetric in x, while the one in
the second bandgap is anti-symmetric in x. Both types of
defect modes are moderately conﬁned. Examples of such
modes at E0 = 1.2 and 3.5 are displayed in Fig. 1(c,
d) respectively. However, these defect modes disappear
when E0 increases above certain threshold values. In par-
ticular, the symmetric branch in the ﬁrst bandgap disap-
pears when E0 > 2.8, while the anti-symmetric branch in
the second bandgap disappears when E0 > 7.5. On the
other hand, before the antisymmetric branch disappears,
another symmetric branch of defect modes appears in-
side the same (second) bandgap. This new branch exists
when 5.3 < E0 < 10.3, and it is generally more localized
than the previous two branches. This can be seen in Fig.
1e where this symmetric defect mode at E0 = 7.5 is il-
lustrated. Compared to Fig. 1(c, d), this new mode is
much more conﬁned.

Three general features in Fig. 1(b) should be noted.
First, for any positive E0 value, at least one defect mode
can be found. Second, each branch of defect modes dis-
appears as E0 increases to above a certain threshold.
Thirdly, as E0 increases, defect modes disappear from
lower bandgaps and appear in higher bandgaps. In other
words, defect modes move from lower bandgaps to higher
ones as E0 increases.

The existence of these defect modes as well as their
proﬁle and symmetry properties have a profound eﬀect
on linear light propagation in the underlying defected
photonic lattices. If the input probe beam takes the pro-
ﬁle of a defect mode, then it will propagate stationarily
and not diﬀract at all. This is seen in Fig. 2(b), where
the numerical evolution of an initial defect mode (with
ǫ = −1 and E0 = 7.5) is displayed (the corresponding
lattice ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 2a). For a Gaussian in-
put beam (as is customary in experimental conditions),
the evolution will critically depend on whether a defect
mode resembling the input Gaussian beam exists under
the same physical conditions. To demonstrate, we take
an initial Gaussian beam as U (x, 0) = e− 1
which re-
sembles the central hump of the defect mode in Fig. 1e,
and simulate its evolution under various E0 values by
pseudo-spectral methods. The lattice intensity ﬁeld is
the same as that in Fig. 2a (where ǫ = −1). We found
that at small values of E0, the Gaussian beam strongly
diﬀracts and quickly becomes invisible. Similar behav-
ior persists as E0 increases (see Fig. 2c) until it reaches
a value about 7.5, when a large portion of the initial
beam’s energy is trapped inside the defect site and prop-
agates stationarily (see Fig. 2d). As E0 increases beyond

3 x2

7.5, however, strong diﬀraction of the probe is seen again
(see Fig. 2e). These results indicate that the light trap-
ping in Fig. 2d could not be attributed to either the
simple guidance due to increased lattice potential or the
nonlinear self-action of the probe beam itself. Rather it
must be attributed to the repeated Bragg reﬂections in-
side the photonic lattice under certain phase-matching
conditions, as the Gaussion beam matches the localized
mode of the defect. This bears strong resemblance to
localized modes in photonic crystal ﬁbers.

For various applications, it is often desirable to keep
the defect modes as locally conﬁned as possible. The de-
fect considered above with ǫ = −1 (see Figs. 1a and
2a) is certainly simple and intuitive, but does it give
the most strongly conﬁned defect modes? To answer
this question, we ﬁx the value of E0 and allow the de-
fect parameter ǫ to vary from −1 to 0, then determine
at what ǫ values the most localized defect modes arise.
With ﬁxed E0 = 6, we have obtained the defect modes
versus ǫ and plotted the results in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a)
reveals that at small negative values of ǫ, a single de-
fect mode bifurcates from an edge of a Bloch band inside
each bandgap. As ǫ decreases, the defect mode in the
ﬁrst bandgap disappears (at ǫ = −0.81), while the one
in the second bandgap persists. The defect-mode branch
in the ﬁrst bandgap is more localized than the one in
the second bandgap in general. Thus we focus on this
branch in the ﬁrst bandgap below. When |ǫ| is small, the
defect eigenvalue is rather close to the left Bloch band,
thus the defect mode is rather weakly conﬁned (see Fig.
3c). As |ǫ| increases, the mode becomes more conﬁned.
As ǫ approaches −0.81, the defect eigenvalue approaches
the right Bloch band, and the defect mode becomes less
conﬁned again (see Fig. 3e). Surprisingly, we found that
the strongly conﬁned defect mode occurs when ǫ ≈ −0.5.
This defect mode and the corresponding lattice intensity
ﬁeld are shown in Fig. 3(d, b) respectively. These ﬁnd-
ings are rather interesting, as they show that the most
localized defect mode arises when the lattice intensity at
the defect site is non-zero rather than zero. Such results
may have important implications for applications of de-
fect modes in photonic lattices.

We have further studied the evolution of a Gaussian
input beam launched at small angles into a photonic lat-
tice with E0 = 6 and ǫ = −0.5. For this purpose, we take
3 x2+ikx, where this
the initial condition as U (x, 0) = e− 1
Gaussian intensity proﬁle resembles the central hump in
the defect mode of Fig. 3d, and the phase gradient k is
proportional to the launch angle of the Gaussian beam.
At zero launch angle (k = 0), a vast majority of the input-
beam’s energy is trapped inside the defect and propa-
gates stationarily (see Fig. 4b). When compared to Fig.
2, we see that the conﬁnement of the probe beam by
the present defect (shown in Fig. 4a) is more eﬃcient,
mainly because the defect mode admitted under these
conditions is more localized (see Fig. 3d). Next we take

2

k = 1, which corresponds to a launch angle of 0.58◦ with
physical parameters listed earlier. In this case, most of
the light is still trapped inside the defect site. However,
the trapped light undergoes robust snake-like oscillations
as it propagates through the defect (see Fig. 4c). The
ability of a negative defect to trap oscillating light beams
is a remarkable feature that merits further investigation.

In summary, we have analyzed linear defect modes in
one-dimensional photonic lattices with negative local de-
fects. These results are expected to pave the way for ex-
perimental observations of such localized modes as well
as for the study of nonlinear defect modes.

Abstract

Theory of the optical parametric ampliﬁcation at high-frequency pumping in crystals

with a regular space modulation of the sign of nonlinear coupling coeﬃcient of interacting

waves is developed. By applying the matrix method, the theory is based on a step-by-step

approach. It is shown that, in the case where the pumping intensity is less than some

critical value, the spatial dynamics of the signal intensity inside a separate layer with the

constant nonlinear coeﬃcient has an oscillatory behavior and the change of the signal

intensity from layer to layer is deﬁned, in general, by the power function. The same law

is valid for the change of variance of signal’s quadrature components. At large number

of layers, these dependences can be reduced to the well-known ones for homogeneous

nonlinear optical crystals.

1 Introduction

Quasi-phase-matched interactions of light waves as well as phase-matched interactions

provide the realization of an eﬀective energy exchange between interacting waves (see,

for example, the reviews [1, 2]) and the possibility to obtain nonclassical light [3, 4].

Quasi-phase-matched interactions are implemented in crystals with the periodic modu-

lation of nonlinear susceptibility. These are crystals with the regular domain structure

or periodically-poled nonlinear crystals (PPNC). In such crystals, the mismatch of wave

vectors ∆k of interacting waves is compensated by an inverse-lattice vector κ of nonlinear

susceptibility’s modulation

κ = 2πm/Λ,

where Λ is the modulation period and m is the quasi-phase-matching order.

The conventional approach for implementing parametric interactions in PPNC consists

in a choice of the domain-structure period Λ, in view of the expression

Λ = 2π/

∆k

,

|

|

where ∆k is the phase mismatch between interacting waves. The period Λ is usually

determined from the analysis of the second-harmonic generation [1, 2]. At the coherence

length lc = Λ/2, the second-harmonic intensity reaches the maximum value and the phase

(related to the phase mismatch and equal to π) compensates the change of the nonlinearity

sign in the neighboring layer (domain) due to the optical-axis inversion.

While nonlinear optical interactions are calculated analytically, PPNC is replaced by a

homogeneous crystal with an eﬀective nonlinear coeﬃcient βeﬀ distinguished from a value

β for the homogeneous crystal by the factor 2/πm, so that

βeﬀ =

2
πm

β.

However, such approach to the optical-parametric-ampliﬁcation process is not always

valued. As it is known, in a parametric process the transition to a steady state of the

optimum phase relation essentially depends on the pumping intensity [5, 6]. Recently, the

spatial dynamics of intensity and phase of the parametrically ampliﬁed wave in PPNC

was investigated in detail [7]. In particular, it was shown that at the transition from

layer to layer the sign of derivative in the phase relation is changed. The change of the

signal wave intensity in PPNC also diﬀers from the homogeneous crystal case. In the

present paper, the simple “step-by-step” approach to the analysis of quasi-phase-matched

optical parametric ampliﬁcation is presented. The knowledge of transmission factors of the

2

layers is the basis of this approach. For the deﬁnition of transmission factors, the matrix

approach elaborated in [8] is used. For an arbitrary number of layers with thickness equal

to the coherence length, expressions for the signal intensity and variance of quadrature

components for an initial random signal phase are derived.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Sec. 2 the equations for degenerate optical parametric ampliﬁcation in PPNC are

presented in generic form using undepleted pump approximation. Section 3 contains the

solution of diﬀerential equation for the optical parametric ampliﬁcation in PPNC in ma-

trix form. In Sec. 4 the solution obtained is analyzed for the case satisfying the condition

of quasi-phase-matched interactions. In Sec. 5 the possibility to generate the quadrature-

squeezed light is considered when classical ﬂuctuations are suppressed. The results ob-

tained are summarized in Sec. 6.

In order to obtain the signal at the output of the second layer, we need to suppose D = D−

and take into account the fact that the output of the ﬁrst layer is simultaneously the input

of the second layer. As a result, the signal at the output of the second layer is determined

by the expression

C(Λ) = exp(D−Λ/2)C(Λ/2) = exp(D−Λ/2) exp(D+Λ/2)C0.

where the matrix Q is

Q = exp(D−Λ/2) exp(D+Λ/2).

Thus, the matrix QN deﬁnes the signal transformation from the PPNC input to its output.

The solution constructed by such a way is based on the assumption that PPNC has a

discrete structure. Due to this, we call such approach the step-by-step approach.

realized and the modulation period Λ = 2lc. The exponential matrix can be presented in

wave inside a separate layer oscillates. By multiplying the exponential matrices D±, the

One can see that it is just the well-known property of phase sensitivity of degenerate

parametric ampliﬁcation. From Eq. (22) follows that the largest ampliﬁcation takes place

at the signal phase ϕ0 =

(π/2). The largest signal suppression is achieved at the signal

where Γ = (4/π)β

length of PPNC. It is worthy to compare expression (23) with the analogous one for the

case of a homogeneous crystal under the phase-matching condition. In the latter case,

the parametric ampliﬁcation increment is equal to Γ0 = 2β0

(see, for example, [5]),

Ap|

|

where β0 is the nonlinear wave coupling coeﬃcient for the homogeneous crystal. The ratio

Γ/Γ0 = (2/π)β/β0 shows the diﬀerence between the optical parametric ampliﬁcation in

PPNC and in the homogeneous crystal. In the case β = β0, we obtain the well-known

result Γ/Γ0 = 2/π.

Thus, at the quasi-phase-matched-wave interaction, the intensity of parametrically

ampliﬁed signal wave under the conditions mentioned above varies in the same way as in

the homogeneous crystal with the eﬀective nonlinear coeﬃcient βeﬀ = (2/π)β. It should

be noted that the same value βeﬀ for PPNC can be obtained, if truncated equation (2) is

averaged over the modulation period of nonlinear-wave-coupling coeﬃcient. However, in

the latter case the conditions of applicability of the equations obtained are not evident.

7

Using formula (22) we have calculated curves presented in Figs. 1 and 2 for ϕ0 =

π/2. Figure 1 shows the dependence of the signal intensity on the interaction length at

the quasi-phase-matched parametric ampliﬁcation in PPNC. Figure 2 demonstrates the

dependence of the parametric ampliﬁcation increment on the interaction length at diﬀerent

relations between the pumping intensity and its critical value. From these ﬁgures, one

can see that, at the same pumping intensity and given interaction length, the signal wave

intensity increases when the pumping intensity approaches its critical value. Therefore, the

replacement of PPNC by the homogeneous crystal with the eﬀective nonlinear coeﬃcient

provides less value for the signal intensity. This diﬀerence grows up when the pumping

intensity Ip approaches to Icr. Comparison of the conversion eﬃciency for the parametric

ampliﬁcation in PPNC and in the homogeneous crystal with nonlinear coeﬃcient βeﬀ is
done in Fig. 3. Note that at Ip ≃

Icr we have used general formula (17).

We turn now to the analysis of quadrature components X, Y of the signal wave in PPNC:

X(z) =

[A(z) + A∗(z)] ,

Y (z) =

X(z) =

i.e., ﬂuctuations of quadrature components are ampliﬁed.

Thus, in PPNC the spatial changing of the variance of signal’s quadrature components

is determined by the power functions as well as the signal intensity. However, if number

of layer pairs N

the ones for the homogeneous crystal:

It is not diﬃcult to draw a conclusion, in view of formulas (28) and (30), that suppression

of ﬂuctuations in PPNC occurs more eﬀectively than in the homogeneous optical crystal

with the eﬀective nonlinear coeﬃcient.

6 Conclusions

The application of step-by-step matrix approach allows one to calculate the optical para-

metric ampliﬁcation in periodically-poled nonlinear crystals without analysis of the spatial

dynamics inside a separate layer. The method can be applied to analysis of the processes

in PPNC at an arbitrary period of the crystal repolarization and arbitrary relation of the

critical intensity to the pumping intensity. In other words, the method is not restricted
to the conditions Ip ≪
the traditional-approach case where PPNC is replaced by an homogeneous crystal with

1 which are necessary for the correct analysis in

Icr and N

≫

eﬀective nonlinear coeﬃcient. This circumstance allows one to use this method for both

analytical and numerical [8] calculations.

The spatial dynamics of the signal intensity and quadrature components was analyzed

versus the ratio Ip/Icr and the interaction length. It was shown that at the pumping

9

intensity less than the critical value, the spatial distribution of the signal intensity inside

a separate layer exhibits an oscillatory character and changing of the signal intensity

and variance of quadrature components from layer to layer follow the power function
dependences. In the case of larger number of layers and Ip ≪

requirement Ip ≥

It should be emphasized that our analyze has shown that the quasi-phase-matched

optical parametric process in PPNC occurs, generally speaking, more eﬀectively than the

parametric process in the homogeneous crystal with the nonlinear coupling coeﬃcient

equal to the eﬀective nonlinear coeﬃcient for PPNC. The generalization of the approach

presented here onto the case of quasi-phase-matched consecutive wave interactions and

nonstationary parametric interactions is in progress.

Abstract

For emitters in a medium, diﬀerent macroscopic or microscopic theoretical models predict sub-

stantially diﬀerent dependencies of the spontaneous emission lifetime on refractive index. Various

measurements have been carried out on Eu3+, Ce3+ and Nd3+ ions, and quantum dots in diﬀerent

surrounding medial. The dependence of the spontaneous emission rates on refractive index has

been interpreted with diﬀerent models. By closely examining some of the experimental results, we

notice that some interpretations are based on implicit assumptions which are hard to justify, and

some measurements contain too big uncertainties to discriminate among diﬀerent models. In this

work we reanalyse the avilable measured results and give a consistent interpretation.

INTRODUCTION

It is well known that the rate of spontaneous emission of emitters can be modiﬁed by

changing the surrounding dielectric medium.1,2 The theory on this subject continues to at-

tract considerable attention due to its fundamental importance and its relevance to various

applications in low-dimensional optical materials and photonic crystals.3,4,5 Various macro-

scopic (see Ref.2 for a recent review) and microscopic5,6,7 theoretical models have been devel-

oped to model the dependence of the spontaneous emission rates (or lifetimes) on refractive

index. However, diﬀerent models predict substantially diﬀerent dependences of radiative

lifetime on refractive index. There are also some measurements intended to discriminize

these models.

In this paper: ﬁrstly, we summarize main theoretical models and the corresponding un-

derlying assumptions (Sec. II); then we examine the existing experimental results that have

been claimed to support diﬀerent models and give them a consistent interpretations (Sec.

II. MAIN THEORETICAL MODELS

Four main models for the dependence of spantaneous emission rates for emitters on

the refractive index of the surrounding medium have been proposed since Purcell8 noticed

that the spnatenous emission rates can be modiﬁed by changing the environment. Since

most early theoretical and experimental results focus on the modiﬁcation of the rate by

placing the emitters inside resonant cavities,9,10 and spatially inhomogeneous dielectrics

including photonic band gap materials.11,12 In those approaches the spantaneous emission

rate is proportionally altered when the radiation density of states is altered. By quantizing

the macroscopic Maxwell’s equations, it can be seen that the density of states of radiation

is proportional to the refractive index n. Therefore one expression for the radiative rate has

been predicted by Nienhuis and Alkemad13 as

ΓR(n) = Γ0n,

(1)

where ΓR(n) and Γ0 are the radiative decay rate of electric dipole emitters in the dielectric

with refractive index n and in vacuum, respectively. The drawback of expression Eq. (1)

is that the dielectric is taken to be homogeneous over the entire space, and also occupies

2

the place occupied by emitters, so that the electric ﬁeld felt by the emitter is equal to

the macroscopic electric ﬁeld (or proportional to the macroscopic electric ﬁeld, with the

coeﬃcient not depending on the surrounding medium).

In general, the ﬁeld felt by emitters is diﬀerent from the macroscopic electric ﬁeld. Taking

this diﬀerence into consideration leads to the so-called local-ﬁeld corrections, which apply to

a wide variety of physical quantities including the spontaneous emission rate of embedded

emitters.

If the system is isotropic on microscopic levels, then the local ﬁeld felt by the

emitter is proportional to the macroscopic ﬁeld with a ratio denoted as f , then we have the

corrected spontaneous emission rate for electric-dipole emitters2

ΓR(n) = Γonf 2.

Macroscopic derivations of the local-ﬁeld correction often imply the use of cavity around

the emitter. The speciﬁc choice of the cavity is subtle mater, greatly complicating the

interpretation of these models. One famous model introduced by Lorentz have been used

in many textbooks.14,15 A hypothetical spherical cavity ﬁlled with medium of the same

average polarizability density as the surrounding dielectric is introduced in this model, but

the contributions from the dipoles inside the cavity to the local electric ﬁeld cancel. The

ratio f is given as

fvirtual =

n2 + 2
3

.

The modiﬁcation of radiative rate based on this ratio is usually called virtual-cavity model

or Lorentz model.2 Using the Lorentz model assumes that the polarizibility of the media is

not altered by introducing the emitters into the media. The results for Ce3+ in various hosts

with diﬀerent refractive indices support this models.16

In the case of ﬂuorescent molecule emitters embedded in solution, the ﬂuorescent

molecules expel the solvent from the volume where they are located and hence creat real

cavities of dielectric there. The ratio of the local electric ﬁeld inside the cavity to the

macroscopic ﬁeld outside the cavity was given by Glauber and Lewenstein17 as

freal =

3n2
2n2 + 1

The modiﬁcation of electric-dipole radiative rate based on this ratio is usually called real-

cavity model2 or Glauber-Lewenstein model. There are quite a few experimental results18,19

on molecular emitters that support this model.

All these models described above are based on a macroscopic description of the dielec-

tric. One of the key features of these models is that the dielectric host are assumed to be

unaﬀected by the presence of the embedded emitter. More recently, Crenshaw and Bowden7

proposed a fully microscopic model for local-ﬁeld eﬀects using quantum-electrodynamical,

many-body derivation of Langevin-Bloch operator equatons for two-level emitters embedded

in a dielectric host. The radiative rate can be written as

ΓR(n) = Γ0

n2 + 2
3

(5)

We shall refer to this model as Crenshaw-Bowden model.

Another very important result on this subject is the work by Berman and Milonni in early

year 2004.5 They calculated the corrections to the electric-dipole decay rate by using another

approach to the fully microscopic many-body theory. Their results are perfectly consistent

with the macroscopic theories to the ﬁrst order of dielectric density. However, to this order,

their theory does not distinguish between the virtual-cavity and real-cavity models for the

local-ﬁeld correction. Therefore, there are still mainly four diﬀerent models for the radiative

rate of embedded emitters, with two models compatible with both macroscopic and fully

microscopic theories.

III. EXISTING EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND REINTERPRETATIONS

A. Reinterpretation of the lifetime of Y2O3:Eu3+ nanoparticles in medium

Recently we analyzed the lifetimes of 5d → 4f transitions of Ce3+ ions in hosts of dif-
ferent refractive indices20 and found that virtual cavity model applies. We notice in the

literature that there had been experimental results on Y2O3:Eu3+ nanoparticles embedded
in medium of various refractive indices21 which can also be interpreted with virtual cavity

model. However, these two situations are very diﬀerent. For the case of Ce3+ in diﬀerent

hosts, Ce3+ ions replace cations of small polarizability and do not change the medium itself,

so that the virtual cavity model applies. However, for the case of Y2O3:Eu3+ nanoparticles

embedded in medium, the medium is expelled from the space occupied by the nanoparticle,

which is similar to the case of ﬂurescent moleculars embedded in solutions. Therefore the

real-cavity model should apply, with the refractive index in the equation replaced with the

4

eﬀective relative refractive index nr of the medium (with eﬀective refractive index neﬀ(x))

to the nanoparticle (assuming the bulk refractive index nY2O3), i.e., the radiative lifetime

τR =

where

nr =

nY2O3

neﬀ = x · nY2O3 + (1 − x) · nmed.

(6)

(7)

(8)

Here nmed is refractive index of the medium without Y2O3 particles, and x is the ‘ﬁlling

factor’ showing what fraction of space is occupied by the Y2O3 nanoparticles surrounded by

the media.

Fig. 1 plots the radiative lifetime as a function of the medium. It can be seen that Eq. (6)

with ﬁlling factor x = 0.15 ﬁts the measurements very well and hence provides an consistent

alternative interpretation to the original interpretation based on virtual-cavity model. The

ﬁlling factor is not explicitly measured and this value is also reasonable.21

B. Reinterpretation of the lifetime of CdTe and CdSe quantum dots in media

Very recently, the lifetime of CdTe and CdSe quantum dots has been measured and com-

pared with three of the above models.22 Although it is not conclusive, the fully microscopic

model of Crenshaw and Bowden7 is suggested to best describe the measurements. There are

two possible problems with the interpretation: Firstly, as mentioned above, in early year

2004 another group5 studied the corrections to radiative lifetime theoretically using another

approach of fully microscopic many-body theory and obtained a theoretical result compat-

ible with macroscopic models. Secondly, in the interpretation, the measurement lifetime is

considered as sololy due to radiative relaxation. It is likely that part of the lifetime is due to

intrinsic nonradiative relaxation. Actually, the measured quantum eﬃciency is around 55%

.

Here we give an alternative explanation of the correction to the lifetime. Since the medium

is expelled from the space occupied by the quantum dots, the real-cavity model should apply.

A reasonable assumption about the nonradiative relaxation rate is that it does not depend

on the medium. In such a case, the lifetime due to both radiative and nonradiative relaxation

5

τ (n) and the quantum eﬃciency η(n) of the quantum dots in medium can be written as

)2n/τR0 + 1/τNR,

= (

3n2

2n2 + 1
τ (n)
η(n) = 1.0 − τ (n)
τNR

.

(9)

(10)

Fig. 2 plots the total lifetime of the quantum dot CdSe as a funciton of the refractive

index of the medium. Again, the real-cavity model ﬁts the experimental lifetime very well

and give an quantum eﬃciency 57% that is is compatible with experiments.

IV. SUMMARY

In summary, experimental results for emitters in the form of nanoparticles or moleculars

that expell the media and creat a real cavity, including those that are originally interpreted

with other models, are compatible with the real-cavity models. This is diﬀerent from the

case that emitters do not change the media, such as Ce3+ ions replace cations with low

polarizability, where the virtual-cavity model applies.

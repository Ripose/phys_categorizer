We study the angular structure of polarization of light transmitted through a
nematic liquid crystal (NLC) cell by theoretically analyzing the polarization state
4
as a function of the incidence angles. For a uniformly aligned NLC cell, the 4
matrix formalism and the orthogonality relations are used to derive the analytical
expressions for the transmission and reﬂection matrices. The polarization resolved
angular patterns in the two-dimensional projection plane are characterized in terms
of the polarization singularities: C points (points of circular polarization) and L lines
(lines of linear polarization). In the case of linearly polarized plane waves incident
on the homeotropically aligned cell, we present the results of detailed theoretical
analysis describing the structure of the polarization singularities. We apply the
theory to compute the polarization patterns for various orientational structures in
the NLC cell and discuss the eﬀects induced by the director orientation and biaxiality.

INTRODUCTION

The optical properties of nematic liquid crystals (NLCs) have long been known to play a
key part in a large variety of their applications [1, 2, 3]. Typically, NLCs are used as optically
anisotropic materials where the anisotropy is determined by the orientational structure which
is sensitive to external ﬁelds and, in restricted geometries, can also be inﬂuenced by changing
the boundary conditions.

Similar to other anisotropic materials, the polarization state of light propagating through
a liquid crystal varies due to the presence of the anisotropy. When the NLC cell is placed
between two crossed polarizers, these anisotropy induced changes of the polarization manifest
themselves in variations of the intensity of the transmitted light. This eﬀect underlines the
vast majority of experimental techniques devised to characterize orientational structures in
NLC cells.

For example, the crystal rotation technique [4] relies on analyzing the angle dependence
of the transmittance of NLC cells placed between crossed polarizers. It can be regarded as
a special case dealing with one-dimensional cross-section of the conoscopic pattern.

Nowadays the conoscopy is proved to be a useful tool for studying liquid crystal systems.
It is used to detect biaxiality of NLCs [5, 6] and to measure the pretilt angle in uniaxial liquid

crystal cells [7, 8]. Orientational structures and helix unwinding process in ferroelectric
smectic liquid crystals were also studied by conoscopy in Refs. [9, 10]. The conoscopic
patterns of hybrid NLC cells were investigated in Ref. [11].

In this paper we are aimed to study the polarization structure behind the conoscopic im-
ages by performing a comprehensive analysis of the polarization state of the light transmitted
through a NLC cell as a function of the incidence angles. Technically, we deal with angular
two-dimensional distribution of the Stokes parameters describing the ﬁeld of polarization
ellipses which might be called the polarization resolved conoscopic (angular) pattern.

It was originally recognized by Nye [12, 13, 14] that the important elements characterizing
the geometric structure of such polarization ﬁelds are the so-called polarization singularities.
In particular, these are the C points [the points where the light wave is circularly polarized]
and the L lines [the curves along which the polarization is linear]. Over the past two
decades these singularities and related issues have been the subject of numerous theoretical,
experimental and numerical studies [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27].

The theory of polarization singularities was applied to study the angular dependence of
the polarization of plane wave eigenmodes in birefringent dichroic chiral crystals [28]. The
polarization state of the electric displacement ﬁeld was analyzed in relation to the direction of
the wave vector. This analysis was recently generalized and extended to a more complicated
case of bianisotropic media [29].

The experimental results and theoretical analysis presented in Ref. [30] deal with the
unfolding of a linearly polarized Laguerre-Gauss (LG01) beam with an on-axis vortex on
propagation through a birefringent crystal.
It was found that a complicated pattern of
polarization singularities is formed as a result of the anisotropy induced symmetry breaking.
Paraxial propagation of a beam carrying the angular momentum along the optic axis
of a uniaxially anisotropic medium was also studied in Refs. [31, 32, 33].
Interestingly,
there are a number of dynamical eﬀects induced by a light beam normally impinging on a
homeotropically aligned NLC cell [34, 35, 36, 37, 38] where liquid crystals appear as unique
anisotropic materials sensitive to the spin and orbital angular momentum of light.

In this study we adapt a systematic theoretical approach and explore the characteristic
features of the polarization structure (the polarization resolved angular pattern) emerging
due to interference of four eigenmodes excited in NLC cells by the plane waves with varying
direction of incidence.

The layout of the paper is as follows. The problem of light transmission through a
uniformly anisotropic NLC cell is considered in Sec. II. Using the 4
4 matrix formalism
and the orthogonality relations we deduce the exact expressions for the transmission and
reﬂection matrices. In Sec. III the analytical results are used for analysis of the polarization
resolved conoscopic patterns when the incident light is linearly polarized.

×

The case of homeotropic NLC cells is treated in Sec. III B. We show that there are
concentric circles each containing four symmetrically arranged C points of alternating hand-
edness. For these C points, we obtain the analytical expressions for the topological index
and for the discriminant whose sign determines the type of the point according to the line
classiﬁcation. The index and the handedness of the C points are found to alternate in sign
along the radial direction. Morphology of the C points lying on the circle of the smallest
radius representing the direction close to the normal incidence is shown to be of the lemon
type with the index equal to +1/2. In suﬃciently thick cells, other C points are either of
1/2) or of the monstar type (the index is +1/2). The L lines

Sec. III C.

Discussion and concluding remarks are given in Sec. IV.

II. TRANSMISSION OF LIGHT THROUGH LIQUID CRYSTAL CELLS

We consider a nematic liquid crystal (NLC) cell of thickness d sandwiched between two
parallel plates that are normal to the z axis: z = 0 and z = d. The NLC represents a
birefringent material with the dielectric tensor given by

ε = ǫ3 I 3 + ∆ǫ1

Typically, anisotropy of nematics is locally uniaxial and NLC molecules align on average
along a local unit director [1]. In this case the NLC director ˆd determines the optic axis
and the expression (1) taken in the limit of vanishing biaxiality with ∆ǫ2 = 0 gives the
ǫk deﬁne
uniaxially anisotropic dielectric tensor. Its two principal values ǫ3 ≡
the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices, no = √µǫ⊥ and ne = √µǫk, where µ is
the NLC magnetic permeability.

ǫ⊥ and ǫ1 ≡

In a more general case of biaxial nematics [39, 40] that were recently observed experi-
mentally [6, 41], there are three diﬀerent dielectric constants ǫ1, ǫ2 and ǫ3 representing the
eigenvalues of the dielectric tensor (1), so that the eigenvectors ˆd, ˆm and ˆl = ˆd
ˆm give the
corresponding principal axes. The unit vectors ˆd, ˆm and ˆl can be conveniently expressed in
terms of Euler angles as follows

×

ˆd = sin θd cos φd ˆx + sin θd sin φd ˆy + cos θd ˆz,
ˆm = cos γd ex(ˆd) + sin γd ey(ˆd),
sin γd ex(ˆd) + cos γd ey(ˆd),

permittivity µm. So, Maxwell’s equations in the medium outside the cell can be obtained
from Eq. (3) by replacing µ and D with µm and ǫmE, respectively.

Another consequence of the boundary conditions (5) is that the tangential components

The expressions (4)–(11) give the electromagnetic ﬁeld of incident, transmitted and re-

ﬂected waves propagating in the ambient medium. This ﬁeld is of the general form

E(x, z) = E(z) eikxx, H(x, z) = H(z) eikxx

independent of the in-plane coordinates x and y.

Given the characteristics of the incident wave, the amplitudes of the reﬂected and trans-
mitted waves cannot be computed from the boundary conditions (13) unless the electromag-
netic ﬁeld within the NLC cell is deﬁned. At this stage we just note that, for the in-plane

Similar result for the reﬂected wave is

where R is the reﬂection matrix.

The equations (24) and (26) give the transmission and reﬂection matrices expressed in
terms of the matrix (22) which is related to the evolution operator (20). For our purposes,
it is instructive to see how this operator can be derived by using the basis of eigenmodes
(normal modes) in a uniformly anisotropic medium. In this case the eigenmodes are known
to be linearly polarized plane waves characterized by the ˆk dependent refractive indices [45,
46, 47].

For plane waves, owing to the Maxwell equation (3b), the electric displacement ﬁeld is

From Eq. (38) it is clear that the azimuthal angle φα becomes indeterminate in the degenerate
case when the coeﬃcients a− and b are both identically equal to zero. Typically, as far as the
eigenmodes are concerned, this case does not present any fundamental diﬃculties. It just
means that the azimuthal angles of the degenerate eigenmodes can be prescribed arbitrarily.
Such freedom of choice, however, does not aﬀect the evolution operator which remains
uniquely deﬁned.

The procedure to determine the characteristics of the eigenmodes involves the following
steps: (a) evaluation of qz by solving the Fresnel equation (36); (b) calculation of the polariza-
tion vectors of the electric displacement ﬁeld D(α) by using the formula (37); (c) computing
the polarization vectors of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds from the relations: E(α) = µ η

1. Uniaxial anisotropy with ∆ǫ2 = 0

Now we apply the above procedure to the limiting case of uniaxial anisotropy with ǫ2 = ǫ3
and ∆ǫ2 = ∆η2 = 0. At ∆η2 = 0, the Fresnel equation (36) takes the factorized form and
the values of qz can be found as roots of two quadratic equations.

The ﬁrst equation 1

eigenmodes are known as the ordinary waves. There are two values of qz

positive, the eigenmode might be called the refracted (forward) eigenwave. In the opposite
case where, similar to the reﬂected wave, q(α)
is negative, the eigenmode will be referred to
as the reﬂected (backward) eigenwave. So, Eq. (39) describes two ordinary eigenmodes: the
refracted eigenwave with qz = q(+o)

z > 0 and the reﬂected eigenwave with qz = q(−o)

z < 0.

Now it is not diﬃcult to derive the evolution operator (20) from the equation (55). We

result

U(z) = Q U d(z) Q−1 = Q U d(z) N −1Q†G,

where the matrix G is deﬁned in Eq. (18).

Owing to the orthogonality relations (17), the matrix N = Q†GQ = diag(N +, N −) is

that the evolution operator is not unitary. It is clear from the identity

where an asterisk indicates complex conjugation, that immediately follows from the expres-
sion (57).

The operator (57) can be substituted into the expression for the matrix V (22) to yield
the transmission and reﬂection matrices given by Eq. (24) and Eq. (26), respectively. By
using Eq. (59), we have the relation for the matrix V

V −1 = V ∗ = G3V †G3, G3 = diag(I 2,

The conservation law T †T + R†R = I 2 is a consequence of the identity (60) and we also
arrive at the conclusion that the transmission matrix (24) is symmetric.

The explicit formulas for the transmission and reﬂection matrices given by Eq. (24) and
Eq. (26). can be obtained by substituting Eq. (57) into Eq. (22). After some straightforward
algebraic manipulations we have

The expressions (61)–(66) can now be used to write explicitly the elements of the trans-

(non-diagonal) elements are zero provided the director is normal (parallel) to the plane of
incidence. In these cases, where either dy = 1 or dy = 0, the matrix τ and the transmission
matrix are both diagonal

III. ANGULAR STRUCTURE OF POLARIZATION ELLIPSE FIELD

In the previous section we deduced the expression for the transmission matrix of the NLC
cell and now we pass on to discussing how the polarization properties of the transmitted
light depend on the direction of the incident wave.

12

This direction is speciﬁed by two angles: the incidence angle θinc and the azimuthal angle
of the plane of incidence φinc. Clearly, we need to replace the director azimuthal angle
φd with φd −
φinc so as to have the Euler angles describing orientation of the director (2)
with respect to the incidence plane. So, the transmission matrix T (θinc, θd, φd) obtained in
Sec. II is changed to T (θinc, θd, φd −
φinc). Dependence of the polarization parameters of
transmitted waves on the angles θinc and φinc will be of our primary concern.

We begin with introducing necessary parameters and notations. Much of this material
can be found in standard textbooks such as [45, 47] (see, e.g., Ref. [27] for a more recent
and extended discussion).

The polarization state of a plane wave can be conveniently characterized by using the

components of its vector amplitude in the spherical basis as follows

of the polarization ellipse with the principal axes directed along the unit vectors e ′

Similar to Refs. [27, 48], we have used Eq. (72) and Eq. (73d) to deﬁne the Stokes parameter
S3 which is opposite in sign to that given in the book [45].

The important special case occurs when the wave is circularly polarized and

= 0,
so that the phases φν and φp are indeterminate. This is an example of the polarization
singularity that, according to Eq. (74), can be regarded as the phase singularity of the
complex Stokes ﬁeld, S = S1 + iS2. The point where the polarization is circular and

will be referred to as the Cν point with ǫell = ν. In our case such points are characterized
by the incidence angles at which the transmitted wave is circular polarized and E(tr)

proportional to the Stokes ﬁeld deﬁned in Eq. (74). Such singularities are characterized
by the winding number which is the signed number of rotations of the two-component ﬁeld
( ˜S1, ˜S2) around the circuit surrounding the singularity [49]. The winding number also known
as the signed strength of the dislocation is generically

Since the polarization azimuth (74) is deﬁned modulo π and 2φp = arg ˜S, the dislocation
strength is twice the index of the corresponding Cν point, IC. For generic C points, IC =

Subsequently, we shall apply the formula (83) expressing the index in terms of the derivatives
with respect to polar coordinates to the case of homeotropically aligned cell.

In addition to the handedness and the index, the C points are classiﬁed according to the
number of straight lines terminating on the singularity. This is the so-called line classiﬁcation
that was initially studied in the context of umbilic points [51].

For generic C points, the number of the straight lines, NC, may either be 1 or 3. This
1/2, and such C points are called stars.
1/2, IC =
number is 3 provided the index equals
At IC = 1/2, there are two characteristic patterns of polarization ellipses around a C point:
(a) lemon with NC = 1 and (b) monstar with NC = 3 [12]. The quantitative criterion to
distinguish between the C points of the lemon and the monstar types was deduced in [27].
We conclude this subsection with the remark that the transmitted wave is linearly polar-

ized when the condition

is satisﬁed. So, Eq. (84) describes loci of points forming the L lines lying in the projection
plane.

When the director is normal to the substrates, the NLC cell is homeotropically aligned
and dz = 1. In this case the transmission matrix is diagonal and the circular components of
the transmitted light are given by

condition:

where δ is the phase diﬀerence, deﬁnes the radii of circles containing the C points. Note that,
in weakly anisotropic NLCs, the phase diﬀerence δ can be approximated by the phase shift
due to the diﬀerence in optical path of the ordinary and extraordinary waves, δ
δo,
for the incidence angles up to 70 degrees. Clearly, Eq. (86) implies that δ = π/2 + πk, where
1 is the non-negative integer and N is the number of solutions. So, in the
k = 0, 1 . . . N
transverse projection plane, there are N circles with C points. The radii of the circles ρk,
k = 0, 1 . . . N

Interestingly, Eq. (91) relates the index of C points and derivatives of the transmission
coeﬃcients with respect to the incidence angle (∂ρf = cos2 θinc ∂f /∂θinc). The index is thus
determined by the circle number k and alternates in sign starting from IC = +1/2. So, the
C points in the vicinity of the origin at ρ = ρ0 can either be lemons or monstars.

More generally, monstars will be the dominating type in regions of pronounced depen-
dence of the transmission coeﬃcients on the incidence angle. By contrast, a mechanism
suppressing strong inhomogeneity may drastically increase the fraction of lemons. For ex-
ample, in liquid crystals, strong director deformations (and large gradients) are inhibited
due to the elastic energy costs and, thus, disclinations of the monstar type are generally
unstable [1].

C. Director tilt and biaxiality induced eﬀects

The analytical results presented in the previous section completely characterize the trans-
mission angular pattern of the light polarization for the homeotropic orientational structure
in terms of the polarization singularities.
In Fig. 2(a), this polarization resolved cono-
scopic pattern is depicted as the ﬁeld of polarization ellipses in the projection plane where
x = tan θinc cos φinc and y = tan θinc sin φinc.

Referring to Fig. 2(a) [see also Eq. (89)], when

π/4, the C points are
arranged in chains formed by four rays along which they alternate in sign of the handedness
and of the index. The symmetry of the chain structure can be deduced from the symmetry
relations (90).

Algebraically, the symmetry properties of the polarization pattern follow because the
transmission matrix for the homeotropic cell (67) is diagonal and the transmission coeﬃ-
cients, tx and ty, are independent of the azimuthal angle of the incidence plane, φ = φinc.
For tilted director conﬁgurations with 0 < θd < π/2, this is no longer the case.

In this case, the transmission matrix (61) is non-diagonal and its elements depend on
φ. Generally, there are two types of the azimuthal angle dependent terms: (a) the terms
φ) and (b) the inversion symmetry breaking terms proportional

In Fig. 2, we show what happen when the tilt angle θd varies from θd = 0 to θd = π/2, so
that the orientational structure changes from the homeotropic conﬁguration to the planar
one. From Fig. 2(b) it is seen that, at small incidence angles, the symmetry breaking terms

result in the shift of the symmetry center. When the incidence angle θd increases further,
the center of symmetry eventually leaves the region speciﬁed by the aperture leading to the
single-chain structure of the C points shown in Fig. 2(c).

In the case of the planar structure with dz = 0 (θd = π/2), it is not diﬃcult to see
y or to d2
that the terms dependent on the azimuthal angle φ are proportional either to d2
x.
So, similar to the homeotropic cell, the origin is the symmetry center for the polarization
pattern of light passed through the planar cell. Fig. 2(d) demonstrates that, by contrast to
the homeotropic structure, where the polarization ﬁeld is of the elliptic type (see Fig. 2(a)),
the angular pattern of polarization is of the hyperbolic type for the planar structure.

The results computed for weakly biaxial orientational conﬁgurations are presented in
Fig. 3. In these calculations, the Euler angles, φd and γd, that specify orientation of the
principal axes (2) are taken to be zero and π/4, respectively. In Fig. 3(a), similar to the
homeotropic cell, the tilt angle θd is zero, whereas the polarization pattern for the tilted
biaxial structure [see Fig. 3(b)] was calculated at θd = 10 degrees. From the patterns
plotted in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b) it is clear that biaxiality induces additional deformations
of the polarization ellipse ﬁeld as compared to the case of uniaxially anisotropic cells.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have studied the polarization resolved angular patterns of light trans-
mitted through uniformly anisotropic NLC cells. Such patterns can be considered as the
polarization structure underlying the conoscopic images measured in experiments with two
crossed polarizers.

Experimentally, this structure can be investigated using a suitably modiﬁed method of
the Stokes polarimetry designed for accurate measurements of the Stokes parameters (a
description of typical experimental set ups can be found, e.g., in Refs. [25, 30]). The predic-
tions of our theory for the homeotropic cell was successfully compared with the polarization
patterns experimentally obtained by the group of experimentalists at Institute of Physics of
NASU (Kyiv, Ukraine). These results are the subject of a separate joint publication.

The exact solution of the transmission (reﬂection) problem for the uniformly anisotropic
cell was derived in Sec. II by using the 4
4 matrix formalism in combination with the
orthogonality relations. We deduced the relation linking the operator of evolution and the
transmission (reﬂection) matrix [see Eq. (24) and Eq. (26)]. Then the basis of eigenwaves was
used to construct the operator of evolution (57). After simplifying algebraic rearrangements
made with the help of the orthogonality relations (18), the ﬁnal result [see Eq. (61) and
2 matrices.
Eq. (62)] was expressed in terms of 2

×

In the case of one interfacial (reﬂecting) surface, the explicit formulas in the 2

2 matrix
form were previously derived in Ref. [52, 53]. Algorithms and useful approximations for
inhomogeneous z-stratiﬁed anisotropic media were suggested in more recent papers [54, 55,
56, 57]. However, for our purposes, it is suﬃce to have the exact expressions in the compact
convenient form that emphasize the symmetry properties of the transmission matrix and
enormously simpliﬁes numerical calculations. An extended discussion of generalizations and
approximation schemes is beyond the scope of this paper.

The analytical results were applied to characterize the polarization resolved angular pat-
terns in terms of the polarization singularities such as C points and L lines. The case of the
homeotropic director conﬁguration was analyzed in detail. We found that the singularities
are symmetrically arranged and deduced the simple formula for the index of C points. We

19

have also formulated the quantitative criterion to determine the type of the C points.

The C points are shown to form chains along which they alternate in sign of the hand-
edness and the index, IC. At IC =
1/2, all the C points are stars, whereas the C points
with IC = +1/2 can either be lemons or monstars depending on how strong the depen-
dence of the transmission coeﬃcients on the incidence angle is. In suﬃciently thick NLC
layers (d > 10 µm for 5CB), the C points of the lemon type are found to be located in the
immediate vicinity of the origin.

−

The patterns for the tilted, planar and weakly biaxial conﬁgurations were computed
numerically and presented as the polarization ellipse ﬁelds. The primary goal of these calcu-
lations is to demonstrate the eﬀects of director orientation and biaxiality on the polarization
resolved angular patterns. At this stage we can only hope that these eﬀects can be used to
develop an improved experimental technique for detecting the peculiarities of liquid crystal
orientational structures. But our results can be regarded as a ﬁrst step in this direction.

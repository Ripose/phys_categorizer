Negative Group Velocity

Kirk T. McDonald

(July 23, 2000)

1 Problem

Consider a variant on the physical situation of “slow light” [1, 2] in which two closely spaced
spectral lines are now both optically pumped to show that the group velocity can be negative
at the central frequency, which leads to apparent superluminal behavior.

1.1 Negative Group Velocity

In more detail, consider a classical model of matter in which spectral lines are associated
with oscillators. In particular, consider a gas with two closely spaced spectral lines of angular
frequencies ω1,2 = ω0 ± ∆/2, where ∆ ≪ ω0. Each line has the same damping constant (and
spectral width) γ.
Ordinarily, the gas would exhibit strong absorption of light in the vicinity of the spectral
lines. But suppose that lasers of frequencies ω1 and ω2 pump the both oscillators into inverted
populations. This can be described classically by assigning negative oscillator strengths to
these oscillators [3].

Deduce an expression for the group velocity vg(ω0) of a pulse of light centered on frequency

ω0 in terms of the (single electron) plasma frequency ωp of the medium, given by

ω2

p =

4πNe2

m

,

(1)

where N is the number density of atoms, and e and m are the charge and mass of an electron.
Give a condition on the line separation ∆ compared to the line width γ such that the group
velocity vg(ω0) is negative.

In a recent experiment by Wang et al. [4], a group velocity of vg = −c/310, where c is the
speed of light in vacuum, was demonstrated in cesium vapor using a pair of spectral lines
with separation ∆/2π ≈ 2 MHz and linewidth γ/2π ≈ 0.8 MHz.

1.2 Propagation of a Monochromatic Plane Wave

Consider a wave with electric ﬁeld E0eiω(z/c−t) that is incident from z < 0 on a medium with
negative group velocity that extends from z = 0 to a. Ignore reﬂection at the boundaries, as
is reasonable if the index of refraction n(ω) is near unity. Deduce a transformation between
the form of the wave inside the medium to that in the region a < z. This solution for a
single, arbitrary frequency can now be applied to the Fourier analysis of a general waveform.
Particularly simple results can be obtained when you make the (unphysical) assumption that
the ωn(ω) varies linearly with frequency about a central frequency ω0.

1

1.3 Propagation of a Sharp Wave Front

In the approximation that ωn varies linearly with ω, deduce the waveforms in the regions
0 < z < a and a < z for an incident pulse δ(z/c − t), where δ is the Dirac delta function.
Show that the pulse emerges out of the gain region at z = a at time t = a/vg, which appears
to be earlier than when it enters this region if the group velocity is negative. Show also that
inside the gain region a pulse propagates backwards from z = a at time t = a/vg < 0 to
z = 0 at t = 0, at which time it appears to annihilate the incident pulse.

1.4 Propagation of a Gaussian Pulse

As a more physical example, deduce the waveforms in the regions 0 < z < a and a < z for a
Gaussian incident pulse E0e−(z/c−t)2/2τ 2
eiω0(z/c−t). Carry the frequency expansion of ωn(ω) to
second order to obtain conditions of validity of the analysis such as maximum pulsewidth τ ,
maximum length a of the gain region, and maximum time of advance of the emerging pulse.
Consider the time required to generate a pulse of risetime τ when assessing whether the time
advance in a negative group velocity medium can lead to superluminal signal propagation.

2 Solution

The propagation of electromagnetic waves at frequencies near those of spectral lines of a
medium was ﬁrst extensively discussed by Sommerfeld and Brillouin [5]. The solution pre-
sented here is based on the work of Garrett and McCumber [6] as extended by Chiao et al.
[7, 8].

2.1 Negative Group Velocity

In a medium of index of refraction n(ω), the dispersion relation can be written

k =

ωn
c

,

(2)

where k is the wave number. The group velocity is then given by

vg = Re"dω

dk# =

1

Re[dk/dω]

=

c

Re[d(ωn)/dω]

=

c

1 + ωRe[dn/dω]

.

(3)

We see from eq. (3) that if the index of refraction decreases rapidly enough with frequency,
the group velocity can be negative. It is well known that the index of refraction decreases
rapidly with frequency near an absorption line, where “anomalous” wave propagation eﬀects
can occur [5]. However, the absorption makes it diﬃcult to study these eﬀects. The insight
of Garret and McCumber [6] and of Chiao et al. [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] is that demonstrations of
negative group velocity are possible in media with inverted populations, so that gain rather
than absorption occurs at the frequencies of interest. This was dramatically realized in the
experiment of Wang et al. [4] by use of a closely spaced pair of gain lines, as perhaps ﬁrst
suggested by Steinberg and Chiao [9].

2

We use a classical oscillator model for the index of refraction. The index n is the square
root of the dielectric constant ǫ, which is in turn related to the atomic polarizability α
according to

D = ǫE = E + 4πP = E(1 + 4πNα),

(4)

(in Gaussian units) where D is the electric displacement, E is the electric ﬁeld and P is the
polarization density. Then, the index of refraction of a dilute gas is

n = √ǫ ≈ 1 + 2πNα.

(5)

The polarizability α is obtained from the dipole moment p = ex = αE induced by electric
ﬁeld E. In the case of a single spectral line of frequency ωj, we say that the charge e is bound
to the (ﬁxed) nucleus by a spring of constant K = mω2
j , and the motion is subject to the
damping force −mγj ˙x, where the dot indicates diﬀerentiation with respect to time. The
equation of motion in the presence of an electromagnetic wave of frequency ω is

Hence,

x =

and the polarizability is

In the present problem, we have two spectral lines, ω1,2 = ω0 ± ∆/2, both of oscillator

constants γ1 = γ2 = γ. In this case, the polarizability is given by

where the second approximation holds when γ ≪ ∆. The electric ﬁeld of a continuous probe
wave then propagates according to

(12)

From this we see that at frequency ω0 the phase velocity is c, and the medium has an
amplitude gain length ∆2c/γω2

2.2 Propagation of a Monochromatic Plane Wave

To illustrate the optical properties of a medium with negative group velocity, we consider
the propagation of an electromagnetic wave through it. The medium extends from z = 0 to
a, and is surrounded by vacuum. Because the index of refraction (10) is near unity in the
frequency range of interest, we ignore reﬂections at the boundaries of the medium.

A monochromatic plane wave of frequency ω, polarized in the x direction and incident

from z < 0, propagates with phase velocity c in vacuum. Its electric ﬁeld can be written

Inside the medium this wave propagates with phase velocity c/n(ω) according to

Eω(z, t) = E0eiωz/ce−iωt ≡ Eω(z)e−iωt

(z < 0).

Eω(z, t) = E0eiωnz/ce−iωt

(0 < z < a).

(17)

(18)

When the wave emerges into vacuum at z = a, the phase velocity is again c, but it has
accumulated a phase lag of (ω/c)(n − 1)a, and so appears as

Eω(z, t) = E0eiωa(n−1)/ceiωz/ce−iωt = E0eiωan/ce−iω(t−(z−a)/c)

(a < z).

(19)

It is noteworthy that a monochromatic wave for z > a has the same form as that inside the
medium if we make the substitutions

z → a,

and

t → t −

z − a

c

.

(20)

Since an arbitrary waveform can be expressed in terms of monochromatic plane waves via
Fourier analysis, we can use these substitutions to convert any wave in the region 0 < z < a
to its continuation in the region a < z.

A general relation can be deduced in the case where the second and higher derivatives of

ωn(ω) are very small. We can then write

ωn(ω) ≈ ω0n(ω0) +

c
vg

(ω − ω0),

(21)

where vg is the group velocity for a pulse with central frequency ω0. Using this in eq. (18),
we have

Eω(z, t) ≈ E0eiω0z(n(ω0)/c−1/vg )eiωz/vg e−iωt = Eω(z)e−iωt

(0 < z < a).

(22)

In this approximation, the Fourier component Eω(z) at any frequency ω of a wave inside the
gain medium is related to that of the incident wave by replacing the frequency dependence
eiωz/c by eiωz/vg and multiplying by the constant phase factor eiω0z(n(ω0)/c−1/vg ). This means
that an incident wave

E(z, t) = f (z/c − t) = Z ∞

−∞

dω Eω(z)e−iωt

(z < 0)

(23)

propagates inside the gain medium with the same pulse shape f , but multiplied by a constant
phase factor and with z/c replaced by z/vg. Thus,

E(z, t) ≈




f (z/c − t)
eiω0z(n(ω0)/c−1/vg )f (z/vg − t)

(z < 0),

(0 < z < a),

(24)

(a < z),

5

where we have used the substitutions (20) to relate the waveform for a < z to that for
0 < z < a.

2.3 Propagation of a Sharp Wave Front

To assess the eﬀect of a medium with negative group velocity on the propagation of a
signal, we ﬁrst consider a waveform with a sharp front, as recommended by Sommerfeld and
Brillouin [5].

As an extreme but convenient example, we take the to incident pulse to be a Dirac delta
Inserting this in eq. (24), which is based on the linear

function, E(z, t) = E0δ(z/c − t).
approximation (21), we ﬁnd

E(z, t) ≈

E0δ(z/c − t)
E0eiω0z(n(ω0)/c−1/vg )δ(z/vg − t)
E0eiω0a(n(ω0)/c−1/vg )δ(z/c − t − a(1/c − 1/vg))

(z < 0),

(0 < z < a),

(25)

(a < z),




According to eq. (25), the delta function pulse emerges from the gain region at z = a
at time t = a/vg. If the group velocity is negative, the pulse emerges from the gain region
before it enters at t = 0. A sample history of the pulse propagation is illustrated in Fig. 2.
Inside the negative group velocity medium, an (anti)pulse propagates backwards in space
from z = a at time t = a/vg < 0 to z = 0 at time t = 0, at which point it appears to
annihilate the incident pulse.

This behavior is analogous to barrier penetration by a relativistic electron [12] in which
an electron can emerge from the far side of the barrier earlier than it hits the near side, if
the electron emission at the far side is accompanied by positron emission, and the positron
propagates within the barrier so as to annihilate the incident electron at the near side. In
the Wheeler-Feynman view, this process involves only a single electron which propagates
backwards in time when inside the barrier. In this spirit, we might say that pulses propagate
backwards in time (but forward in space) inside a negative group velocity medium.

If a gain medium existed such that the index of refraction varied linearly with frequency
and the slope dn/dω was negative, then the advanced appearance of the sharp wavefront as
described by eq. (25) would constitute superluminal signal propagation.

However, from Fig. 1 we see that a linear approximation to the index of refraction is

reasonable in the negative group velocity medium only for |ω − ω0| <∼ ∆/2. The sharpest
wavefront that can be supported within this bandwidth has characteristic risetime τ ≈ 1/∆.
For the experiment of Wang et al. where ∆/2π ≈ 106 Hz, an analysis based on eq. (21)
would be valid only for pulses with τ >∼ 0.1 µs. Wang et al. used a pulse with τ ≈ 1 µs, close

to the minimum value for which eq. (21) is a reasonable approximation.

Since a negative group velocity can only be experienced over a limited bandwidth, very
sharp wavefronts must be excluded from discussion of signal propagation. However, it is well
known that the meaning of signal velocity is ambiguous unless the waveform is sharp [5].
Hence, signal transmission in a negative group velocity medium will always be associated
with some lack of crispness.

6

2.4 Propagation of a Gaussian Pulse

We now consider a Gaussian pulse of temporal length τ centered on frequency ω0 (the carrier
frequency), for which the incident waveform is

E(z, t) = E0e−(z/c−t)2/2τ 2

eiω0z/ce−iω0t

(z < 0),

(26)

Inserting this in eq. (24) we ﬁnd

E(z, t) =

E0e−(z/c−t)2/2τ 2
−t)2/2τ 2

eiω0(z/c−t)

E0e−(z/vg
E0eiω0a(n(ω0)−1)/ce−(z/c−a(1/c−1/vg )−t)2/2τ 2

(z < 0),

(0 < z < a),

(27)

eiω0(z/c−t)

(a < z).




The factor eiω0a(n(ω0)−1)/c in eq. (27) for a < z becomes eω2

pγa/∆2c using eq. (11), and repre-
sents a small gain due to traversing the negative group velocity medium. In the experiment
of Wang et al. this factor was only 1.16.

We have already noted in the previous section that the linear approximation to ωn(ω) is
only good over a frequency interval about ω0 of order ∆, and so eq. (27) for the pulse after
the gain medium apply only for pulsewidths

.

τ >∼

(28)

Further constraints on the validity of eq. (27) can obtained using the expansion of ωn(ω)
to second order. For this, we repeat the derivation of eq. (27) in slightly more detail. The
incident Gaussian pulse (26) has the Fourier decomposition

Eω(z) =

dE(z, t)eiωtdt =

E0e−τ 2(ω−ω0)2/2eiωz/c

We again extrapolate the Fourier component at frequency ω into the region z > 0 using
eq. (18), which yields

Eω(z) =

τ
√2π

E0e−τ 2(ω−ω0)2/2eiωnz/c

where A is evaluated at z = a here. As expected, the forms (32) and (34) revert to those of
eq. (27) when d2(ωn(ω0))/dω2 = 1.

So long as the factor A(a) is not greatly diﬀerent from unity, the pulse emerges from the

medium essentially undistorted, which occurs when

As in the case of the delta function, the Gaussian pulse emerges from the negative group

velocity medium at time

(37)

The pulse can advance by at most a few risetimes due to passage through the negative group
velocity medium.

While this aspect of the pulse propagation appears to be superluminal, it does not imply

superluminal signal propagation.

In accounting for signal propagation time, the time needed to generate the signal must
be included as well. A pulse with a ﬁnite frequency bandwidth ∆ takes at takes at least time
τ ≈ 1/∆ to be generated, and so is delayed by a time of order its risetime τ compared to the
case of an idealized sharp wavefront. Thus, the advance of a pulse front in a negative group
velocity medium can at most compensate for the original delay in generating that pulse. The
signal velocity, as deﬁned by the path length between the source and detector divided by the
overall time from onset of signal generation to signal detection, remains bounded by c.

As has been emphasized by Garrett and McCumber [6] and by Chiao [10, 11], the time
advance of a pulse emerging from a gain medium is possible because the forward tail of a
smooth pulse gives advance warning of the later arrival of the peak. The leading edge of
the pulse can be ampliﬁed by the gain medium, which gives the appearance of superluminal
pulse velocities. However, the medium is merely using information stored in the early part of
the pulse during its (lengthy) time of generation to bring the apparent velocity of the pulse
closer to c.

The eﬀect of the negative group velocity medium can be dramatized in a calculation
based on eqs. (27) in which the pulse width is narrower than the gain region (in violation of

8

condition (35)), as shown in Fig. 2. Here, the gain region is 0 < z < 50, the group velocity is
taken to be −c/2, and c is deﬁned to be unity. The behavior illustrated in Fig. 2 is perhaps
less surprising when the pulse amplitude is plotted on a logarithmic scale, as in Fig. 3.
Although the overall gain of the system is unity, the leading edge of the pulse is ampliﬁed
by about 70 orders of magnitude in this example (the implausibility of which underscores
that condition (35) cannot be evaded), while the trailing edge of the pulse is attenuated by
the same amount. The gain medium has temporarily loaned some of its energy to the pulse
permitting the leading edge of the pulse to appear to advance faster than the speed of light.
Our discussion of the pulse has been based on a classical analysis of interference, but,
as remarked by Dirac [13], classical optical interference describes the behavior of the wave
functions of individual photons, not of interference between photons. Therefore, we expect
that the behavior discussed above will soon be demonstrated for a “pulse” consisting of a
single photon with a Gaussian wave packet.

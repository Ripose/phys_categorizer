Abstract

Based on the Ewald-Oseen extinction theorem, the omnidirectional total transmission of waves

incident from vacuum into an anisotropic dielectric-magnetic metamaterial is investigated. It is

shown that the omnidirectional total transmission need not limit at the interface associated with

the conventional nonmagnetic anisotropic medium. The recent advent of a new class of anisotropic

dielectric-magnetic matermaterial make the omnidirectional total transmission become available.

It is found that the inherent physics underlying the omnidirectional total transmission are collective

contributions of the electric and magnetic responses.

INTRODUCTION

The phenomena of reﬂection and refraction of light at the interface of two transparent

media are widely used for steering light in many optical devices. There has been much

discussion on realizations of omnidirectional total reﬂection [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. While the

omnidirectional total transmission, where wave is completely transmitted for arbitrary in-

cident directions, attracted little attention. Recently, the omnidirectional total refraction

at the planar interface associated with convention nonmagnetic uniaxial crystal have been

studied [7, 8].

The advent of a new class of anisotropic dielectric-magnetic metamaterial with negative

permittivity and permeability has attained considerable attention [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Lin-

dell et al. [14] have extended that anomalous negative refraction can occur at the interface

associated with an anisotropic dielectric-magnetic metamaterial, which does not necessarily

require that all tensor elements of permittivity ε and permeability µ have negative val-

ues. The study of such anisotropic metamaterial have recently received much interest and

attention [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].

The question thus naturally arises: whether there exists any type of interface associated

the anisotropic dielectric-magnetic material support the omnidirectional total transmission.

In the present work, we present an investigation on the omnidirectional total transmission

from vacuum into anisotropic dielectric-magnetic metamaterial. We ﬁnd that the omni-

directional total transmission need not limit at the interface associated with conventional

nonmagnetic uniaxial crystal. We want to explore how the omnidirectional total transmis-

sion shows up at microscopic leave.

II. THE EWALD-OSEEN EXTINCTION THEOREM

In molecular optics theory, a bulk material can be regarded as a collection of molecules

(or atoms) embedded in the vacuum. Under the action of an incident ﬁeld, the molecules

oscillate as electric and magnetic dipoles and emit radiations. The radiation ﬁeld and the

incident ﬁeld interact to form the new transmitted ﬁeld in the material and the reﬂection

ﬁeld outside the material [21]. Let us carry this idea one step further: the metamaterial is

structured into subunits. In the case of electromagnetic radiation this usually means that

the subunits must be much smaller than the wavelength of radiation. Then the unit cells of

metamaterials can be modelled as the molecules (or atoms) in ordinary materials.

For anisotropic metamaterials one or both of the permittivity and permeability are

second-rank tensors. To simplify the proceeding analysis, we assume the permittivity and

permeability tensors are simultaneously diagonalizable:

where εi and µi are the permittivity and permeability constants, respectively. We choose

the z axis to be normal to the interface, the x and y axes locate at the plane of the interface.

Following the Ewald-Oseen extinction theorem, the total radiated ﬁeld Erad is the sum

of the contribution from all electric dipoles Ee

rad and that from all magnetic dipoles Em

rad.

While the incident ﬁeld is assumed to permeate to the medium without being aﬀected by

the interface and the properties of that medium [21]. Hence the reﬂected ﬁeld in vacuum

(

< z < 0) can be expressed in the terms of the collective operations of the electric and

induced by the dipoles:

Er = Ee

Et = Ee

While the transmitted ﬁeld is the superstition of the incident ﬁeld and all the radiated ﬁeld

In the other words, the re-emission of the electric and magnetic dipoles to the half of the

space (0

) extinguishes the incident ﬁeld and produces the transmitted ﬁeld.

bining Eqs. (9) and (10) with Eq. (3), we can obtain the following dispersion relation

It should be mentioned that the same dispersion relation can be obtained from the Maxwell

equations.

Next, let us review the transmission in isotropic nonmagnetic media. In classical elec-

trodynamics, a simple generalization shows that the zero ﬂection exists occurs when H-

polarized waves incident from vacuum into an isotropic nonmagnetic medium (µI = 1). The

total transmission takes place at an incident angle satisfying θi + θr = π/2. Such an angle,
determined by θB = tan−1[√εI], is called the Brewster angle [21].

The Ewald-Oseen extinction theorem allow us to investigate how the Brewster angle

generates. From the point of view of molecular optics, we know that the radiated ﬁelds

would never occur along the axes of electric and magnetic dipoles. The inherent physics for

Brewster angle in isotropic nonmagnetic media is that the axes of electric dipoles align with

the direction of the reﬂected wave. While in the anisotropic dielectric-magnetic material, the

physics origins are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. The Brewster angle occurs when the magnitudes

of Ee

rad and Em

rad are equal. Setting Er = 0 in Eq. (2), the Brewster angle can be expressed

For the purpose of illustration, let us choose the positive anisotropic parameters in Fig.

2(a), while select the corresponding negative anisotropic parameters in Fig. 2(b). It can be

seen from the Fig. 2(a) that Ee

the magnetic dipoles contribute to the reﬂected ﬁeld. In this special case, the condition for

Brewster angle requires that the axes of magnetic dipoles align with the direction of the

reﬂected wave. However, compared with Fig. 2(a), the values of Ee

are much larger and never reach zero. Note that the directions of Ee

III. OMNIDIRECTIONAL TOTAL TRANSMISSION

From the point of view of molecular optics, the microscopic interpretation of the omni-

directional total transmission lies in the cancellation of two extremely large ﬁelds radiated

by diﬀerent types of induced dipoles:

electric and magnetic dipoles cancel each other for any incident angle.

An alternative view is that the re-emission of the electric and magnetic dipoles induced by

incident ﬁeld cancel out in vacuum. To some extent, any incident angle can be considered

to be a Brewster angle. Substituting Eqs. (11) and (12) into Eq. (2), we can obtain

The omnidirectional total transmission means that Eq. (16) should be satisﬁed for arbitrary

Next we want to investigate the omnidirectional total transmission of H-polarized incident

wave. The appearance of the omnidirectional total transmission for the H-polarized waves

is due to the reverse roles of electric and magnetic response. Evidently, interchanging ε and

To obtain a better physical picture of the omnidirectional total transmission, we plot the

radiated ﬁelds induced by the electric and magnetic dipoles in Fig. 3. The radiated ﬁelds

rad always have the same magnitude but exhibit the opposite directions. Hence,

the resulting reﬂected ﬁelds cancel each other for any incident angle.

Comparing Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b) show that, although the phenomenon of omnidirec-

tional total transmission is formally identical (Er0

for uncovering the inherent secret in anisotropic metamaterials.

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have investigated the omnidirectional total transmission of waves inci-

dent from vacuum into anisotropic dielectric-magnetic metamaterials. The omnidirectional

total transmission need not limit at the interface conventional nonmagnetic anisotropic crys-

tal. If certain conditions are satisﬁed, the anisotropic dielectric-magnetic metamaterials pro-

vide more available option to realize the omnidirectional total transmission. We have shown

that the inherent physics underlying the omnidirectional total transmission are collective

operations of the electric and magnetic responses. We expect many potential applications

based on the total omnidirectional direction discussed above. They can, for example, be

used to construct refection absent lens, radar-absorbing material and light bending device.

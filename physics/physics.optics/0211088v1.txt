We investigate the spectral features of the emission from a superluminal polarization current whose
distribution pattern rotates with an angular frequency ω and oscillates with an incommensurate
frequency Ω > ω. This type of polarization current is found in recent practical machines designed to
investigate superluminal emission. Although all of the processes involved are linear, we ﬁnd that the
broadband emission contains frequencies that are higher than Ω by a factor of the order of (Ω/ω)2.
This generation of frequencies not required for the creation of the source stems from mathematically
rigorous consequences of the familiar classical expression for the retarded potential. The results
suggest practical applications for superluminal polarization currents as broad-band radiofrequency
and infrared sources.

INTRODUCTION

Considerable recent interest has been generated by the design [1, 2, 3, 4], construction [5] and testing [6] of novel light
sources which employ extended distributions of polarization currents moving faster than c, the speed of light in vacuo.
Although Special Relativity does not allow a charged particle with ﬁnite inertial mass to move faster than c, there is
no such restriction on macroscopic polarization currents, because their superluminally moving distribution patterns
may be created by the coordinated motion of aggregates of subluminally moving particles [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].
Moreover, the distinction between massive and massless charges is not in any way reﬂected in Maxwell’s equations,
so that the propagating distribution patterns of such polarization currents radiate as would any other moving sources
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld [7, 11, 12, 13].

In view of this interest, the present paper explores the frequency spectrum produced by such superluminal sources.
We base our analysis on the practical implementation of a superluminal source (Appendix A, [1, 5]), and consider
the electromagnetic waves emitted from a polarization current whose distribution pattern rotates with an angular
frequency ω and oscillates with an incommensurate frequency Ω > ω (Table 1). It is found that the broadband signals
carried by such waves contain frequencies that are by a factor of the order of (Ω/ω)2 higher than the frequency Ω;
i.e. the radiation contains frequencies which are not required for the creation or the practical implementation of the
source. This results from the cooperation of two eﬀects, both of which are mathematically rigorous consequences of
the familiar classical expression for the retarded potential.

1. The retarded time is a multi-valued function of the observation time in the superluminal regime, so that the
interval of retarded time during which a particular set of wave fronts is emitted by a source point can be
signiﬁcantly longer than the interval of observation time during which the same set of wave fronts is received at
the observation point.

2. The centripetal acceleration enriches the spectral content of a rotating volume source, for which Ω/ω is diﬀerent

from an integer, by eﬀectively endowing the distribution of its density with space-time discontinuities.

These two eﬀects make it possible, for instance, to generate a broadband pulse of radiation whose spectrum has a
peak in the terahertz band by means of a device whose construction and operation only entails oscillations at two
radio frequencies: at Ω/(2π) = 302.5 MHz and at a multiple mω (with, e.g., m = 72) of ω/(2π) = 5 MHz (see Table
1 and Appendix A).

This paper is organised as follows. Section II A outlines the novel features of the radiation from oscillating, acceler-
ated superluminal polarization currents, contrasting this type of emission with those of fast travelling wave antennas,
and ˇCerenkov and synchrotron radiations. Although considerable mathematical rigour is required to derive the fre-
quency spectrum of such superluminal sources (this stems from the necessary three-dimensionality of superluminal
sources; superluminal sources cannot be point-like [7, 11, 12, 13]), some of the essential features can be demonstrated
in the case of a localized source, a source whose dimensions are appreciably smaller than the radiation wavelength;

this is carried out in Section II B as an aid to understanding the more complex analysis that follows. Section II C
introduces those properties of a rotating volume source that contribute to to the distinctive spectral features of the
emitted radiation. The algebraic description of the polarization current (its time dependence and orientation) used in
the subsequent analysis is given in Section II D; all of the later results are presented in terms of the parameters deﬁned
here. Finally, Section II E emphasizes the important contribution that the centripetal acceleration makes to the broad-
band nature of the emission. The detailed mathematical formulation of the problem of an extended superluminal
source is set out in Section III. The special case of those volume elements which contribute coherently to the ﬁeld at
the observer is discussed in Section IV, highlighting the importance of focal regions in the space of observation points
(Section IV A) and the inadequacies of conventional far-ﬁeld approximations in evaluating the electromagnetic ﬁelds
(Section IV B). The radiation ﬁeld in the plane of the source’s orbit is treated in Section V, which contains graphical
representations of the spectral distribution of the emitted power (Figs. 8 and 9); the predicted frequency spectra show
broadband, high-frequency emission from a source whose implementation entails only two basic frequencies. A similar
treatment for the radiation ﬁeld outside the plane of the source’s orbit is given in Section VI, which also describes the
polarization of the emitted radiation (Table 2). A detailed comparison with synchrotron and dipole radiations using
an analogous mathematical description is given in Section VII, and the eﬃciency of the radiative process is estimated
in Section VIII. Conclusions and a summary are given in Section IX.

II. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF THE EMISSION FROM AN EXTENDED, ROTATING,
OSCILLATING SUPERLUMINAL POLARIZATION CURRENT

A. Comparison with fast travelling wave antennas, and ˇCerenkov and synchrotron radiations

Superluminally moving surface charges are already encountered in fast travelling wave antennas [14] and certain
types of leaky waveguides [15]. The wave fronts emanating from such uniformly moving superluminal sources possess
an envelope on which the vacuum version of the ˇCerenkov eﬀect can be observed. However, the source considered in
the present paper has the time dependence of a travelling wave with both an accelerated superluminal motion and an
oscillating amplitude; neither of these features are present in extant antennas.

The superluminal sources considered in the present paper have distinctive features of both the sources of ˇCerenkov
and synchrotron radiations: not only do they move with a speed that exceeds the propagation speed of the waves they
generate (like sources of ˇCerenkov radiation) but also their motion is centripetally accelerated (like that of sources of
synchrotron radiation). However, in contrast to sources of these familiar types of emission, they are extended (rather
than point-like) and they ﬂuctuate in their strength (rather than being time-independent in their own rest frames).
Acceleration leads to the formation of a cusp in the envelope of the wave fronts that emanate from each volume
element of the superluminal source [16], a curve along which two sheets of the envelope meet tangentially (Fig. 1). (By
contrast, the conical envelope of wave fronts in the ˇCerenkov emission has no cusp.) At any given observation time, the
radiated ﬁeld entails a set of such envelopes (each associated with the wave fronts emanating from a speciﬁc member
of a corresponding set of source elements) whose cusps pass through the observation point. These caustics arise from
those volume elements of the source which approach the observer, along the radiation direction, with the speed of
light and zero acceleration at the retarded time (Fig. 2). The contribution from the ﬁlamentary locus of such source
elements toward the value of the ﬁeld at the observation point has certain unexpected properties. Its intensity, for

ω on a circle of radius r = 2.5c/ω (ˆr ≡ rω/c = 2.5). The circles in broken lines designate the orbit of S and the light cylinder
rP = c/ω (ˆrP = 1). The curves to which the emitted wave fronts are tangent are the cross sections of the two sheets φ± of the
envelope with the plane of source’s orbit. (b) Three-dimensional view of the light cylinder and the envelope of wave fronts for
the same source point S. The tube-like surface constituting the envelope is symmetric with respect to the plane of the orbit.
The cusp along which the two sheets of this envelope meet touches, and is tangential to, the light cylinder at a point on the
plane of the source’s orbit and spirals around the rotation axis out into the radiation zone (based on [7]).

FIG. 2: The bifurcation surface (i.e. the locus of source points that approach the observer along the radiation direction with the
speed of light at the retarded time) associated with the observation point P for a clockwise source motion. The cusp Cb, along
which the two sheets of the bifurcation surface meet tangentially, touches the light cylinder (ˆr = 1) at point O. This cusp curve
is the locus of source points which approach the observer not only with the speed of light but also with zero acceleration along
the radiation direction. For an observation point in the radiation zone, the spiralling surface that issues from P undergoes a
large number of turns, in which its two sheets intersect one another, before reaching the light cylinder. Note that the bifurcation
surface issues from the observation point P and resides in the space (r, ˆϕ, z) of source points, while the envelope of wave fronts
issues from a source point and resides in the space (rP , ˆϕP , zP ) of observation points; the similarity between these two surfaces
reﬂects the reciprocity properties of the Green’s function for the problem (based on [7]).

wave, but more slowly: like RP

−2, as in the case of a spherically spreading

In the current paper, we shall restrict our analysis to the frequency content of the spherically-decaying emission;
the spectrum of the non-spherically-decaying component of the emission is treated in a separate work [19]. As has
already been mentioned, a rigorous analysis of this problem is of considerable complexity (Sections III-VIII) owing to
the extended nature of superluminal sources; we therefore ﬁrst brieﬂy discuss the case of a localized source, a source

whose dimensions are appreciably smaller than the radiation wavelength. This simpliﬁed case deﬁnes the Green’s
function for the more complex problem, and illustrates some properties of the emission which are also valid in the
more general case.

B. Properties of the emission from a localized, rotating and oscillating superluminal source

Consider a localized source (a source whose dimensions are appreciably smaller than the radiation wavelength, i.e.,
essentially a point source) which moves on a circle of radius r with the constant angular velocity ωˆez, i.e. whose path
x(t) is given, in terms of the cylindrical polar coordinates (r, ϕ, z), by

where ˆez is the basis vector associated with z, and ˆϕ the initial value of ϕ.

The wave fronts that are emitted by this point source in an empty and unbounded space are described by

r = const.,

z = const., ϕ = ˆϕ + ωt,

|xP − x(t)| = c(tP − t),

where the coordinates (xP , tP ) = (rP , ϕP , zP , tP ) mark the space-time of observation points. The distance |xP −x| ≡ R
between the observation point xP and the point source x is given by

R = [(zP − z)2 + rP

2 + r2 − 2rP r cos(ϕP − ϕ)]

1
2 ,

so that the insertion of Eq. (1) in Eq. (2) yields

tP = t + [(zP − z)2 + rP

2 + r2 − 2rP r cos(ϕP − ˆϕ − ωt)]

1
2 /c.

For a given source point (r, ˆϕ, z) and various positions (rP , ϕP , zP ) of the observation point, this dependence of the
reception time tP on the emission time t can have one of the generic forms shown in Fig. 3.

When rω > c, there is a one-dimensional set of observation points for which dR/dt = −c and d2R/dt2 = 0 at the
emission times tc of the waves, i.e. whose members are approached by the superluminally moving source point with
the speed of light and zero acceleration at the retarded time. These observation points are located on the cusp of the
envelope of the emitted wave fronts (Fig. 1), where curve (b) of Fig. 3 passes through an inﬂection point. In their
vicinity, Eq. (4) reduces to

tP = tP c + 1

6 ω2(t − tc)3 + · · · ,

where tP c is the value of tP at which the waves emitted at t = tc arrive, and constructively interfere, at the cusp
curve of the envelope (see Appendix C of [7]). Note that the coeﬃcient of the third-order term in the above Taylor
expansion happens to be independent of the coordinates r and z of the source, a feature that enhances the cooperative
(coherent) nature of the process to be described below (Section IV).

Now suppose that, in addition to moving faster than its own waves, the point source in question has a strength
which ﬂuctuates with a frequency higher than that of its rotation, like cos(Ωt) with Ω > ω (Table 1). The amplitude
of the ﬁeld it would generate will then be proportional to the retarded value of this ﬂuctuating factor, i.e. to a function
1
of tP that, according to Eq. (5), has the form cos{Ω[tc + 6
3 ]} at points close to the caustics of the
wave fronts. The period of oscillations of the observed ﬁeld is given by the time interval in which the argument of
this function changes from Ωtc to Ωtc + 2π. It will have a value, therefore, that is by the factor 2
3 (πω/Ω)2 shorter
than the period 2π/Ω of the ﬂuctuations of the source strength. Stated diﬀerently, the time interval t − tc = 2π/Ω in
which a set of wave fronts is emitted is by the factor 3
2 (πω/Ω)−2 longer than the time interval tP − tP c during which
the same set of wave fronts is received.

C. Extension to superluminal volume sources

The ﬁeld of a uniformly rotating point source constitutes only the Green’s function for the present emission pro-
cess [18]. For a corresponding extended source to emit waves of a certain frequency, it is necessary in addition that
the spectrum of temporal ﬂuctuations of its density should contain that frequency. In this respect, the frequency
enhancing eﬀect associated with a rotating superluminal source diﬀers radically from that which is familiar from
synchrotron radiation. The space-time distribution of density for the charged particle which acts as the source of
synchrotron radiation entails the Dirac delta function and so has a spectral decomposition that is independent of

FIG. 3: The relationship between the observation time tP and the emission time t for an observation point that lies (a) inside
or on, (b) on the cusp of, and (c) outside the envelope of the wave fronts or the bifurcation surface shown in Figs. 1 and 2. This
relationship is given by g(r, ϕ, z; rP , ϕP , zP ) = ˆϕ − ˆϕP , an equation which applies to the envelope when the position (r, ˆϕ, z)
of the source point is ﬁxed and to the bifurcation surface when the location (rP , ˆϕP , zP ) of the observer is ﬁxed. (Note that,
by virtue of the linear relation ϕ = ˆϕ + ωt, the motion of the source may be parametrized either by t or by ϕ.) The maxima
and minima of curve (a), at which dR/dt = −c, occur on the sheets φ+ and φ− of the envelope (or the bifurcation surface),
respectively (see Figs. 1 and 2). The inﬂection points of curve (b), at which d2R/dt2 = 0, occur on the cusp curve of the
envelope (or the bifurcation surface).

frequency. That the maximal intensity in the spectrum of synchrotron radiation corresponds to a frequency which is
much higher than the rotation frequency of its source merely reﬂects a spectral property of the Green’s function for
that emission process (Section VII). Superluminal sources, on the other hand, are necessarily extended [7, 11, 12, 13];
the spectra of their densities do not, in general, contain all frequencies.

We now come to a vital distinction between stationary and rotating volume sources which leads to a radical diﬀerence
in the spectral content of the associated emission. This is connected with the diﬀering constraints on the ranges of
values of ϕ and ˆϕ, constraints which in turn dictate the form assumed by the Fourier decomposition of the source
density with respect to time.

The space-time distribution of the rotating point source described in Eq. (1), whose path may be written as r = r0,

ϕ = ˆϕ + ωt, z = 0, has the density

ρ(r, ϕ, z, t) = q δ(r − r0)δ(ϕ − ωt − ˆϕ)δ(z)/r,

(6)

where δ is the Dirac delta function, q is the volume integral of ρ, and r0 a constant. It is known from the analysis
of synchrotron radiation that the azimuthal angle ϕ which appears in Eqs. (1) and (6) is not limited to an interval
of length 2π, as in the description of a stationary source distribution, but (by virtue of having the value ˆϕ + ωt) can
range over the same interval as the time t, i.e. over (−∞, ∞). Since ϕ = 2π represents the same point in space as
ϕ = 0 at any given (r, z), the source density (6) is periodic, both in ϕ and in t. However, the azimuthal coordinate ϕ
does not discontinuously change back to zero each time a rotation is completed. If the time interval over which the
source density is described by Eq. (6) exceeds a rotation period, then the angle ϕ = ˆϕ + ωt that is traversed by the
source during this time interval would also exceed 2π.

Now consider a localized volume source that rotates about the z-axis with a constant angular frequency ω (Table 1).
The density distribution ρ(r, ϕ, z, t) for a source of this kind depends on the azimuthal coordinate ϕ in only the
combination ˆϕ = ϕ − ωt, i.e. is a function of (r, ˆϕ, z, t). If we label each volume element of this source by the value
ˆϕ of its azimuthal coordinate ϕ at t = 0, the equations describing the trajectories of these elements would each have
the same form as Eq. (1). It can be seen from the collection of space-time trajectories of the constituent volume
elements of this source, therefore, that the ranges of values of both ϕ and t are inﬁnite, as in the case of a rotating
point source, but values of the Lagrangian coordinate ˆϕ are limited to an interval of length 2π, e.g. to −π < ˆϕ ≤ π
(Fig. 4). The coordinate ˆϕ cannot range over a wider interval because no volume element of an extended source may
be labelled by more than one value of a Lagrangian coordinate. Phrased diﬀerently, the aggregate of volume elements
that constitute a rotating source in its entirety can at most occupy an azimuthal interval of length 2π at any given

6

FIG. 4: Projection of the trajectories (world lines) of the volume elements of a uniformly rotating extended source onto the
(ϕ, t) space. The Lagrangian coordinate ˆϕ ≡ ϕ − ωt designating the initial (t = 0) position of each source element lies in (−π, π)
while both ϕ and t range over (−∞, ∞). The space-time trajectory (world tube) of the extended source itself in (ϕ, t) space
consists of the array of trajectories of its constituent volume elements (the broken lines) encompassed by the lines ˆϕ = −π and
ˆϕ = π.

FIG. 5: The ˆϕ dependence, cos(m ˆϕ) cos[Ω( ˆϕ − ϕ)/ω], of the source density decribed by Eq. (7) at a ﬁxed (r, ϕ, z) for m = 1,
Ω/ω = 3.5 and ϕ = π/5. This ˆϕ dependence is, by virtue of the relationship t = ( ˆϕ−ϕ)/ω, equivalent to a time dependence: the
space-time of source elements may be marked either by the coordinates (r, ϕ, z, t), as in Eq. (7), or by the coordinates (r, ϕ, z, ˆϕ)
as in Eq. (19). The plotted function is physically meaningful only within the interval −π < ˆϕ < π. However, once this function
is expanded into a Fourier series over the interval (−π, π), a new periodic function results, represented by the series, which is
coincident with the original function within (−π, π) and periodically reproduces the original function outside this interval. The
periodic function represented by the series outside (−π, π) is designated by broken lines. That the Fourier expansion of source
density (7) should contain an inﬁnite number of terms may be understood in two (mathematically equivalent) ways: either as
due to the discontinuities of the periodic function shown here or as due to the non-zero diﬀerence between the values of this
density at ˆϕ = ±π.

time (e.g. t = 0).

D. Algebraic representation of polarization currents with superluminally rotating distribution patterns

For an extended source of radiation whose distribution pattern rotates uniformly, the cylindrical components of
the electric current density, j, similarly depend on ϕ only via the Lagrangian coordinate ˆϕ ≡ ϕ − ωt: they have the
space-time dependence jr,ϕ,z(r, ϕ, z, t) = jr,ϕ,z(r, ˆϕ, z), where jr,ϕ,z stand for the components of j along the cylindrical
base vectors (ˆer, ˆeϕ, ˆez). In this paper we consider sources that oscillate in addition to moving, i.e. sources for which

7

(7)

jr,ϕ,z are given by jr,ϕ,z(r, ˆϕ, z)f (t) with an additional dependence f (t) on time. To be speciﬁc, we base the analysis
on a representative polarization current j = ∂P/∂t for which

Pr,ϕ,z(r, ϕ, z, t) = sr,ϕ,z(r, z) cos(m ˆϕ) cos(Ωt),

−π < ˆϕ ≤ π,

where Pr,ϕ,z are the cylindrical components of the polarization (the electric dipole moment per unit volume), s(r, z)
is an arbitrary vector that vanishes outside a ﬁnite region of the (r, z) space and m is a positive integer (Table 1).

For a ﬁxed value of t, the azimuthal dependence of the above density along each circle of radius r within the source is
the same as that of a sinusoidal wave train, with the wavelength 2πr/m, whose m cycles ﬁt around the circumference
of the circle smoothly. As time elapses, this wave train both propagates around each circle with the velocity rω and
oscillates in its amplitude with the frequency Ω (Table 1). The vector s is here left arbitrary in order that we may
later investigate the polarization of the resulting radiation for all possible directions of the emitting current (this
will be summarised in Table 2). Note that one can construct any distribution with a uniformly rotating pattern,
Pr,ϕ,z(r, ˆϕ, z), by the superposition over m of terms of the form sr,ϕ,z(r, z, m) cos(m ˆϕ).

An experimentally viable device capable of generating a polarization with the distribution (7) is described in
Appendix A [1, 5]. Even though the practical implementation of the polarization (7) by means of this speciﬁc device
only entails the two frequencies mω and Ω, the spectral decomposition of this polarization consists of an inﬁnite set of
frequencies if Ω/ω is diﬀerent from an integer. One can directly demonstrate this by Fourier analyzing the right-hand
side of Eq. (7).

Because the domain of deﬁnition of the source density (7) only extends over the interval −π < ˆϕ ≤ π, or equivalently
(ϕ − π)/ω ≤ t < (ϕ + π)/ω, Fourier decomposition of the time dependence of this function at a given (r, ϕ, z) should
be performed by means of a series rather than an integral. Representation of Eq. (7) by a Fourier integral would
entail assumptions about the dependence of jr,ϕ,z on ˆϕ in intervals (−∞ < ˆϕ < −π and π < ˆϕ < ∞) which lie
outside the domain of deﬁnition of this density. The following Fourier series faithfully represents the right-hand side
of Eq. (7) within its domain of deﬁnition and replaces it by a periodic function outside the physically relevant domain

The symbol {Ω → −Ω} designates a term like the one preceding it in which Ω is everywhere replaced by −Ω.

Note that the Fourier components Cn of the function describing the time dependence of Pr,ϕ,z would vanish for all
n 6= (Ω/ω) ± m only if Ω/ω is an integer (Table 1). When Ω and ω are not commensurable, the factor sin(πΩ/ω) in
Eq. (9) is diﬀerent from zero and the spectrum of Pr,ϕ,z contains all frequencies. It is not diﬃcult to see the reason
for this: the Fourier series representation of Pr,ϕ,z equals a periodic function in −∞ < ˆϕ < ∞ whose values at the
beginning and at the end of a period are diﬀerent when Ω/ω is diﬀerent from an integer (see Fig. 5). The higher
frequencies stem from these step-like discontinuities of the global function represented by the series, discontinuities
which lie outside the physically relevant domain −π < ˆϕ ≤ π but which nevertheless mathematically inﬂuence the
Fourier expansion of the limited part of this function that describes the source density.

E. The role of centripetal acceleration in providing broadband emission

Physically, the agent responsible for this implicit discontinuity and so the broadening of the spectrum of the
source density is centripetal acceleration. That the spectral content of a rectilinearly moving source is broadened by
acceleration can be directly seen from the transformation x′ = x + ut + 1
2 at2 between an accelerated frame S (with
the initial velocity u and acceleration a) and an inertial frame S′. A source that is spatially monochromatic in its own
rest frame, e.g. exp(ikx) with the wavenumber k, is transformed into one, exp[ik(x′ − ut − 1
2 at2)], whose spectrum
does not even decay at high frequencies. The corresponding eﬀect of centripetal acceleration on the spectrum of a
source is more subtle and is manifested in a kinematic constraint set by the geometry of rotation.

Because there is only one parameter (ω) for describing both the speed (rω) and the acceleration (rω2) of a uniformly
rotating source element, the centripetal acceleration of a rotating extended source shows up in the constraint −π <
ˆϕ ≤ π on the range of values of the Lagrangian coordinate ˆϕ: an aspect of the geometry of rotation that acts as an

additional parameter. Had the range of ˆϕ been inﬁnite, the time dependence of the distribution in Eq. (7) would have
been indistinguishable from that of a rectilinearly moving source with a constant velocity and its Fourier transform
would have contained only the frequencies |Ω ± mω|, irrespective of whether Ω and ω are commensurable or not. It
is the fact that ˆϕ is an angle marking the elements of a rotating source that gives rise to the constraint −π < ˆϕ ≤ π,
to eﬀective space-time discontinuities in the source density, and to the higher frequencies.

Given that both a representative source density and the Green’s function for the present emission process have
spectra which contain inﬁnite sets of frequencies, it is not unexpected that the analysis in Sections V and VI should
predict a resulting radiation that is correspondingly broadband. This prediction is not incompatible with the fact
that oscillations at no more than two frequencies (mω and Ω) are required for creating the representative source
distribution [Eq. (7)] in the laboratory (Appendix A; Table 1). As in the case of any other linear system, the present
emission process generates an output only at those frequencies which are carried both by its input (the source) and its
response (Green’s) function. What entails only two frequencies is the practical implementation of the source we are
considering and not its spectral content. The density distribution of the present source includes implicit space-time
discontinuities (Fig. 5) whose Fourier decompositions contain all frequencies [Eq. (9)]. These step-like discontinuities
do not require (for their practical implementation) the creation of any rapid changes either in space or in time; they
have to do with the geometry of rotation and automatically stem from centripetal acceleration.

The radiation ﬁeld that arises from the superluminal portion (r > c/ω) of the volume source described in Eq. (7)
−2

consists (as shown in [7]) of two components: a spherically decaying component whose intensity diminishes like RP
with the distance RP from the source, and a non-spherically spreading component whose intensity diminishes more
slowly with distance. The analysis in this paper is concerned only with the spectral properties of the spherically
−1 instead of
decaying component of the radiation. The component of the radiation whose intensity decays like RP
RP

−2 is emitted only at the two frequencies |Ω ± mω| [19].

III. DETAILED FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

A. Electromagnetic ﬁelds in the far-ﬁeld limit

In the absence of boundaries, the retarded potential Aµ arising from any localized distribution of charges and

currents with a density jµ is given by

Aµ(xP , tP ) = c−1

d3x dt jµ(x, t)δ(tP − t − R/c)/R, µ = 0, · · · , 3

Z

where R stands for the magnitude of R ≡ xP − x, and µ = 1, 2, 3 designate the spatial components, A and j, of Aµ
and jµ in a Cartesian coordinate system. The expressions that follow for the electromagnetic ﬁelds

E = −∇P A0 − ∂A/∂(ctP )

and

B = ∇P ×A

when we simply diﬀerentiate Eq. (10) under the integral sign, and evaluate the resulting integrals by parts, are

since jµ vanishes outside a ﬁnite volume.

Terms of the order of R−2 in the above integrands, which do not contribute toward the ﬂux of energy at inﬁnity,
may be discarded if we are concerned only with the radiation ﬁeld. Since the problem we will be considering entails
the formation of caustics, however, we need to treat the phases of the above integrands, i.e. the arguments of the
delta functions in Eqs. (12) and (13), more accurately. If we replace ∂j0/∂(ct) in Eq. (12) with −∇ · j from continuity,
integrate this term by parts and retain only those terms in the integrands of Eqs. (12) and (13) that are of the order
of R−1, we obtain

and B ≃ ˆn×E. Here, we have set the origin of the coordinate system within the source distribution so that |x| ≪ |xP |
for an observation point in the far ﬁeld and R/R can be approximated by the constant vector ˆn ≡ xP /|xP |; the

(14)

symbol ≃ indicates that the expression is valid in the far-ﬁeld limit. These diﬀer from the standard expressions for
radiation ﬁelds [17] only in that the argument of the delta function in their integrands is left exact.

For the purposes of evaluating the integrals in Eq. (14) for the current density that is given by Eq. (7), the space-time
of source points may be marked either with (x, t) = (r, ϕ, z, t) or with the coordinates (r, ˆϕ, z, t) that naturally appear
in the description of that rotating source. In fact, once ˆϕ is adopted as the coordinate that ranges over (−π, π), the
retarded position ϕ of the rotating source point (r, ˆϕ, z) as well as the retarded time t could be used as the coordinate
whose range is unlimited (see Fig. 4).

The electric current density j = ∂P/∂t that arises from the polarization distribution (7) is given, in terms of ϕ and

ˆϕ, by

j = 1

4 iω

µ=µ± µ exp[−i(µ ˆϕ − Ωϕ/ω)](srˆer + sϕˆeϕ + szˆez)

P

where µ± ≡ (Ω/ω) ± m and the symbol {m → −m, Ω → −Ω} designates a term like the one preceding it in which
m and Ω are everywhere replaced by −m and −Ω, respectively. To put this source density into a form suitable for
inserting in Eq. (14), we need to express the ϕ-dependent base vectors (ˆer, ˆeϕ, ˆez) associated with the source point
(r, ϕ, z) in terms of the constant base vectors (ˆerP , ˆeϕP , ˆezP ) at the observation point (rP , ϕP , zP ):

the radiation direction ˆn.

B. Green’s functions

Inserting Eq. (18) in Eq. (14) and changing the variables of integration from (x, t) = (r, ϕ, z, t) to (r, ϕ, z, ˆϕ), we

obtain

where ≃ again indicates that the expression is accurate in the far-ﬁeld limit, and Gi (i = 1, 2, 3) are the functions
resulting from the remaining integration with respect to ϕ:

(cid:9)

Here R is as in Eq. (3), φ stands for ˆϕ − ˆϕP with ˆϕ ≡ ϕ − ωt and ˆϕP ≡ ϕP − ωtP , the function g is deﬁned by

g ≡ ϕ − ϕP + ˆR,

with ˆR ≡ Rω/c, and ∆ϕ is the interval of azimuthal angle traversed by the source. The r and z integrations in Eq.
(19), though extending over the entire (r, z) space, of course receive contributions only from those regions of this space
in which the source densities sr,ϕ,z are non-zero.

Note that it would make no diﬀerence to the outcome of the calculation whether one uses the expression in Eq. (19)
and integrates over the coordinates ( ˆϕ, ϕ) as we have done, or one uses Eq. (14) with (x, t) = (r, ϕ, z, t) and integrates

over (t, ϕ) as is conventionally done. If one follows the conventional procedure and ﬁrst integrates with respect to
t, then the constraint −π < ˆϕ ≤ π would show up as the restriction (ϕ − π)/ω ≤ t < (ϕ + π)/ω on the range of t
integration (see Fig. 4).

The functions Gi(r, ˆϕ, z; rP , ˆϕP , zP , ϕP ) here act as Green’s functions: they describe the ﬁelds of uniformly rotating
point sources with ﬁxed (Lagrangian) coordinates (r, ˆϕ, z) whose strengths sinusoidally vary with time. The ﬁeld (19)
is given by the superposition of the ﬁelds of the assembly of such uniformly rotating volume elements from which the
extended source (15) is built up. In the special case in which Ω = 0, i.e. the strength of the source is constant, G3
reduces to the Green’s function called G0 in [7]. The singularity structures of Gi are determined by the stationary
points of the phase function g and so are identical to the singularity structure already outlined in connection with G0
(see [7]).

C. Spectral decomposition of the radiated ﬁeld

Spectral decomposition of the radiated ﬁeld E may be achieved, as in any other time-dependent problem, simply
by replacing the delta function in Eq. (20) with its Fourier representation. Because the integration with respect to ˆϕ
only extends over the interval (−π, π) (Section II C), Fourier decomposition of the ˆϕ dependence of this delta function
should be performed by means of a series.

The integrand in Eq. (19) needs to be faithfully represented only within the range of integration. Representation of
this integrand by a Fourier integral would entail assumptions about the dependence of jr,ϕ,z on ˆϕ in intervals which
lie outside the domain of deﬁnition of the source density: in −∞ < ˆϕ < −π and π < ˆϕ < ∞ (see Section II).

Once the delta function δ(g − φ) that appears in the integral representation of Gi in Eq. (20) is expanded into a

Fourier series over the interval −π < ˆϕ < π,

δ(g − φ) = (2π)−1

and constitute the Fourier components of the Green’s functions Gi.

Because the values of ˆϕ are limited to an interval of length 2π, the radiation is emitted in harmonics nω of the
rotation frequency (Table 1). The periodic nature of the motion of the source imposes this constraint despite the fact
that the source distribution [Eq. (7)] lacks periodicity. [Recall that the ratio Ω/ω that appears in the expression for
the source density, Eq. (7), is diﬀerent from an integer.] In the regime Ω/ω ≫ 1, however, the peak of the spectrum
happens to occur at such a high value of the harmonic number n that this spectrum is essentially continuous.

IV. LOCI OF COHERENTLY-CONTRIBUTING SOURCE ELEMENTS

A. The importance of focal regions in the space of observation points

The ﬁlamentary cusps of the envelopes of the wave fronts that emanate from various volume elements of an extended
superluminal source (Fig. 1) collectively occupy a tubular volume of the xP space, a volume which we shall refer to

11

as the focal region of the space of observation points. At any given observation point P within this focal region, there
are certain volume elements of the source whose contributions towards the value of the ﬁeld at the observation time
tP superpose coherently, i.e. arrive at xP with the same phase. These consist of those elements of the superluminally
moving source which approach the observer along the radiation direction with the speed of light and zero acceleration
at the retarded time (Section II B). Or stated mathematically, for large values of the harmonic number n, the
main contributions towards the value of the multiple integral (24) representing the radiation ﬁeld ˜En come from the
stationary points of the optical distance tP − t − R/c, given by the function g(r, ϕ, z) of Eq. (21), that appears in
the phase of the rapidly oscillating exponential exp(−ing) in the integrand of this integral [20, 21, 22]. As a ﬁrst
step towards the asymptotic evaluation of the multiple integral in Eq. (24), therefore, we need to identify the loci of
points at which the derivatives ∂g/∂r, ∂g/∂ϕ and ∂g/∂z vanish and to expand g into a Taylor series about each of
its stationary points.

There is in the present case a point at which all three of the above derivatives are zero. The coordinates of this

point, which we shall designate as O, are given by

O :

ˆr = 1, ϕ = ϕP + 2π − arccos(1/ˆrP ) ≡ ϕO,

z = zP ,

(27)

where ˆr ≡ rω/c and ˆrP ≡ rP ω/c stand for the values of r and rP in units of the light-cylinder radius c/ω. The second
derivative ∂2g/∂ϕ2 of g also vanishes at O. Since the derivative of g with respect to ϕ at ﬁxed (r, ˆϕ, z) is proportional
to the derivative of t − tP + R/c with respect to t at ﬁxed (r, ϕ, z), the conditions ∂g/∂ϕ = 0 and ∂2g/∂ϕ2 = 0
respectively correspond to the conditions dR/dt = −c and d2R/dt2 = 0 which we encountered in Section II B (see
Fig. 3). Not only does the point O belong to the locus of source points that approach the observer with the speed of
light and zero acceleration at the retarded time (i.e. lies on the cusp curve of the observer’s bifurcation surface (Figs.
1 and 2, [7]), but it is in fact the point at which this locus touches, and is tangential to, the light cylinder r = c/ω
(see Fig. 2).

Whether or not the above stationary point falls within the domain of integration depends on the position of the
observation point. For a localized source distribution whose dimensions are much smaller than the distance of the
observer from the source, O would fall within the domain of integration only if the observer lies in the plane of
rotation, i.e. if the plane which passes through the observation point and is normal to the rotation axis intersects the
source distribution; otherwise, there would be no source points for which z equals zP .

For an observer who is located outside the plane of rotation, i.e. whose coordinate zP does not match the coordinate

z of any source element, only ∂g/∂r and ∂g/∂ϕ can vanish simultaneously. This occurs along the curve

In the far-ﬁeld limit, where the terms (ˆz − ˆzP )2/(ˆr2

P − 1)2 and ˆrC /ˆrP in Eq. (28) are much smaller than unity, this

(29)

of source points which approach the observer along the radiation direction with the wave speed and zero acceleration
at the retarded time, i.e. it coincides with the cusp curve of the bifurcation surface (Fig. 2).

B. The inadequacy of conventional far-ﬁeld approximations

The above calculation makes it clear how essential it is that one should start with the exact form of the optical
distance |xP −x(t)|−c(tP −t) for identifying the loci of its stationary points. The far-ﬁeld approximation |xP −x(t)| ≃
|xP |−x·xP /|xP | that is normally introduced at the outset of a calculation in radiation theory [17] here would obliterate,
not only signiﬁcant geometrical features of the loci of these stationary points, but also such determining characteristics
as the degree of their degeneracy. The far-ﬁeld approximation would replace the function g by

g ≃ ˆRP − ˆz cos θP + ϕ − ϕP − ˆr sin θP cos(ϕ − ϕP ),

ˆRP ≫ 1,

1
2 . It is hardly possible to discern the geometrical details of O and C from this expression, let

To preserve the essential features of g about its critical point O, we need to express this function in terms of the

variables

(30)

(31)

ξ ≡ ϕ − ϕO,

η ≡ ˆr − 1,

ζ ≡ ˆz − ˆzP ,

prior to proceeding to the far-ﬁeld limit. The resulting exact expression for g(ξ, η, ζ) reduces, when expanded in
powers of ˆr−1

P , to

g = φO + ξ − (1 + η) sin ξ + [4(1 + η) sin2(ξ/2) − (1 + η)2 sin2 ξ + η2 + ζ2]/(2ˆrP ) + · · · ,

(32)

where φO ≡ ˆrP + ϕO − ϕP . The term of order ˆr−1
P in this expansion clearly plays a crucial role in determining the
nature of the stationary point ξ = η = ζ = 0 and so cannot be discarded as in conventional radiation theory. For the
purposes of calculating the asymptotic values of the radiation integrals by the method of stationary phase [20, 21, 22],
however, it is mathematically permissible to approximate the coeﬃcient of this term by means of a Taylor expansion
about O. To within the third order in ξ and η, the result is (η2 + ζ2)/2 so that

g = φO + ξ − (1 + η) sin ξ + (η2 + ζ2)/(2ˆrP ) + · · · .

This is a more accurate version of the far-ﬁeld approximation which, in contrast to that appearing in Eq. (30), exhibits
the nondegenrate nature of the stationary point O explicitly: neither the coeﬃcient of η2 nor that of ζ2 are zero in
the Taylor expansion of g about O.

The corresponding expansion of g about a point (ˆrC , ϕC , ˆz) on curve C (with an arbitrary coordinate ˆz 6= ˆzP ) can

likewise be found by ﬁrst rewriting this function in terms of the variables

The result is

ρ ≡ ˆr − ˆrC , µ ≡ ϕ − ϕC .

g = ϕC − ϕP + µ + [ ˆR2

and have made use of the fact that, according to Eqs. (28) and (36), ˆrC (ˆr2
If we now expand the right-hand side of Eq. (35) in powers of ˆR−1

C (which tends to ˆR−1

P

in the far zone) and

approximate the coeﬃcient of ˆR−1

C in the resulting expansion by its value in the vicinity of ρ = µ = 0, we arrive at

g = φC + µ − (1 + ρ/ˆrC ) sin µ + [ρ2 + (ˆr2

C − 1)µ2]/(2 ˆRC) + · · · ,

where φC ≡ ˆRC + ϕC − ϕP . The term ρ2 in the coeﬃcient of ˆR−1
C in Eq. (37) plays an essential role in specifying the
degree to which g is stationary on C: ρ only appears linearly in the earlier terms of the expansion. The term µ2 in
this coeﬃcient, on the other hand, merely represents a small correction of the order of ˆR−1
C to the dependence of the
value of g on µ and is of no consequence as far as the asymptotic values of the radiation integrals are concerned. We
shall therefore neglect the term ˆR−1

C µ2 in Eq. (37) from now on.

We have already alluded to the distinction between observation points in and outside the plane of the source

(Section IV A); we shall now treat these two cases separately in Sections V and VI.

V. THE RADIATION FIELD IN THE PLANE OF THE SOURCE’S ORBIT

A. Treatment of individual volume elements; asymptotic expansion of the Green’s function

Suppose that the observation point is located within the region z< ≤ zP ≤ z> spanned by the orbital planes of
various volume elements of the source and that its coordinate ϕP at the observation time tP is such that the stationary
point O falls within the range ∆ϕ of integration in Eq. (25) (z< < 0 and z> > 0 stand for the extremities of the
z extent of the source distribution). Then the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of ˜Gi for large RP and n
may be obtained by the method of stationary phase: by replacing the phase function g in Eq. (25) with its expanded
version (33), approximating the coeﬃcient fi of the rapidly oscillating exponential with its limiting value

at O, and extending the range of integration ∆ϕ to (ϕO − π, ϕO + π) (see [20, 21, 22]).

for large χ and positive ν (see [24]). The leading contributions toward the values of the Anger functions in Eq. (40),
therefore, come from the Bessel functions Jn−Ω/ω(nˆr) and J ′
n−Ω/ω(nˆr) whose asymptotic values for large n decay
more slowly than n−1 in the superluminal regime. (Here and in what follows, we treat Ω as a positive constant.)

When the argument of Jν (χ) is smaller than its order and so can be written as χ = ν sech α for some α > 0, the

asymptotic values, for large ν, of this Bessel function and its derivative are given by

(see [23]). In this regime, the Bessel functions in question decrease exponentially with increasing ν: the exponent
tanh α − α is negative for all positive α. But when the argument of Jν(χ) is greater than its order and can be written
as χ = ν sec β for some 0 < β < π/2, we have [23]

In this case, the Bessel functions in question oscillate with amplitudes that decrease algebraically, like ν− 1

The contributions in Eq. (24) that arise from the source elements in ˆr < 1 − Ω/(nω), therefore, are exponentially
smaller than those which arise from ˆr > 1 − Ω/(nω): the asymptotic values of the Green’s functions appearing in Eq.
(24) are proportional either to Jn−Ω/ω(nˆr) or to J ′
n−Ω/ω(nˆr) for large n. In particular, the contributions proportional
to Jn−Ω/ω(n) and J ′
n−Ω/ω(n), that arise from a source element at the stationary point O, are greater for the terms
involving Ω in Eq. (24) than for those involving −Ω.

B. Frequencies of emission from individual volume elements

The emission is strongest at the frequency with which the source oscillates in addition to moving, i.e. at a value
of nω for which the integer n is closest to Ω/ω. Figures 6 and 7 respectively show the n dependences of the squares

plotted quantities are respectively proportional to the squares of moduli of the Green’s functions ˜G2 and ˜G1 at O [see
Eq. (40)]. Figure 6 depicts the spectral distribution of the emission that arises from the single comoving point O of
a polarization along the r or the z directions, and Fig. 7 depicts the spectrum of the corresponding emission from a
current which ﬂows in the ϕ direction [see Eq. (24) for θP = π/2].

The spectral distributions shown in Figs. 6 and 7 conﬁrm the following result that was earlier inferred from time-
domain considerations in Section II: the contributions of a rotating point source that is coincident with O, and
so approaches the observer with the speed of light and zero acceleration at the retarded time, are made over a
wide range of frequencies and have peaks at harmonic numbers n ≫ 1 which are of the order of (Ω/ω)3 when

ω ≪ Ω ≪ nω. This is a consequence of the fact that in this regime we have Jn−Ω/ω(n) ∼ (2/n)

C. Superposition of the contributions from the constituent volume elements of the source

The Green’s function ˜Gi(r, ˆϕ, z; n) calculated in the preceding section represents the contribution to ˜En of a speciﬁc
volume element of the uniformly rotating source: that which has the azimuthal coordinate ˆϕ at the time t = 0 and
which moves on a circular orbit of radius r on a plane that is normal to and crosses the rotation axis at z. To ﬁnd the
radiation ﬁeld that arises from an extended source, we must superpose the contributions from the constituent volume
elements of that source, i.e. we must insert this Green’s function in the integral representation (24) of the ﬁeld and
perform the integrations with respect to r, ˆϕ and z that extend over the localized region of the rest frame occupied
by that source.

Here we have replaced r, rP and z by their values in units of the light-cylinder radius (ˆr, ˆrP and ˆz) and have used
the deﬁnition µ± ≡ (Ω/ω) ± m to rewrite sin[π(n − µ±)] as (−1)n+m+1 sin(πΩ/ω). The Anger function J and its
derivative J′ are deﬁned in Eq. (41).

Note that if Ω/ω is an integer, the factors sin[π(n − µ±)]/(n − µ±) in Eq. (46) would have the value π at n = µ±
and would vanish at all other n. When Ω and ω are not commensurable, on the other hand, neither the numerators
nor the denominators in these factors can vanish at any n. For non-integral values of n, the quantity Q ˆϕ, and hence
the spectrum of the source density (15), is non-zero for all frequencies (see also Section II and Fig. 5). We shall here
assume not only that the parameter Ω/ω is diﬀerent from an integer but also that it is appreciably greater than unity.
Our interest lies primarily in the high-frequency regime where the radiation frequency nω is appreciably greater than
the frequencies |mω ± Ω| that enter the creation of the source (cf. Appendix A).

The leading terms in the asymptotic expansions for large n of the integrals over ˆr and ˆz in the expression for ˜En can
both be found by an elementary version of the method of stationary phase [20, 21, 22]. If the lower and upper limits
of the radial interval in which the source densities sr,ϕ,z are non-zero are denoted by ˆr< < 1 and ˆr> > 1, respectively,
then the asymptotic value of the integral over ˆr in Eq. (45) is given by

and the functions C(η) and S(η) are the Fresnel integrals [23]. We have integrated over the interval (ˆr<, ˆr>), rather
than (−∞, ∞), in order to obtain expressions that are valid also within the Fresnel distance rP ∼ (r> − r<)2(nω)/(πc)
from the source. For an observation point that lies at inﬁnity, the integration with respect to ˆr may be directly
performed over (−∞, ∞), without introducing ˆr< and ˆr>.

Here, z> > zP and z< < zP are the lower and upper limits on the extent of the source distribution in the z direction.
(The coordinates r and z, without the superscriptˆ, are measured in standard units of length rather than in units of
the light-cylinder radius c/ω.)

When the z interval z> − z< that is occupied by the source is appreciably smaller than the radius of the light
cylinder, the observer would have to have a colatitude θP that is quite close to π/2 for the stationary point O to lie
within the source distribution. From Eqs. (47) and (48) for θP = π/2, it therefore follows that

n−Ω/ω(n)sϕOˆek,

in which srO,ϕO,zO stand for the values of sr,ϕ,z at the stationary point O. Thus the contributions of the poloidal
components of the polarization (sr and sz) to the radiation ﬁeld are both stronger than, and 90 degrees out of phase
with, the contribution of the toriodal component sϕ (see Table 2).

D. The radiated power and its spectral distribution

The expression that is given by Eq. (51) for the Fourier component ˜En of the radiation ﬁeld in the plane of rotation
applies to any frequency nω for which n ≫ 1, provided of course that the distance rP of the observer appreciably
exceeds both the radius c/ω of the light cylinder and the dimensions r> − r< and z> − z< of the source. If nω is
also much greater than the frequencies |mω ± Ω| that enter the creation of the source, the asymptotic value of the
radiation ﬁeld for large frequency reduces to

for both the additional terms in the Anger functions [Eq. (41)] and the terms associated with −Ω [Eq. 51)] would be
negligibly small. This expression holds not only in the far zone but also within the Fresnel zone. The Fresnel distance
from the source, which designates the boundary between the near and far zones at a given frequency nω, is deﬁned
by rP ≃ [nω/(πc)] max {(r> − r<)2, (z> − z<)2} in the present case.

When the observation point lies closer to the source than the Fresnel distance, the arguments of the Fresnel integrals

FIG. 8: Spectral distribution of the radiation that is generated by a poloidal polarization current for Ω/ω = 15.5 and m = 72.
The normalization factor is the value ˜E87 of the radiation ﬁeld at a harmonic number (n = 87) close to the peak emission at
n = (m + Ω/ω) or f = (mω + Ω)/2π (see Fig. 9); frequency f and harmonic number n are related via 2πf = nω. The plotted
quantity has the value 1 at n = 87 and decreases monotonically over the range 87 < n < 400 of harmonic numbers not shown
here (see Fig. 9). The inset highlights the highest frequency peak of the spectrum.

Beyond the Fresnel distance from the source, on the other hand, the limiting values of C and S are such [23] that

Qr ∼ ˆr> − ˆr<,

ˆrP ≫ (n/π)(ˆr> − ˆr<)2,

for in the far zone the arguments of the oscillating exponentials in the integrands in Eqs. (50a) and (52a) tend to zero.
The inclusion of higher order terms in the expansion of g in powers of ˆr − 1 and ˆz − ˆzP would not alter this result:
the coeﬃcients of these higher order terms contain correspondingly higher powers of ˆr−1

The radiated power received by an observer in the far zone per harmonic per unit solid angle is given by dPn/dΩP =
2| ˜En|2/(2π), where dΩP denotes the element sin θP dθP dϕP of solid angle in the space of observation points.

According to Eqs. (54) and (56), this power has the following asymptotic value for high frequency and θP = π/2:

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

Figures 8 and 9 show the emitted power by a poloidal polarization current (sr or sz) for Ω/ω = 15.5 and m = 72.
The amplitude of this power has in both ﬁgures been normalized by its value at the harmonic number closest to the
source frequency mω + Ω, i.e. by the power that is emitted into n = 87. [Note that the peak emission of the device
described in Appendix A is always close to f = (mω + Ω)/2π; in the case of Ω/ω = integer, the only emission occurs
at this frequency and its companion f = (mω − Ω)/2π. We show elsewhere [19] that, irrespective of the value of Ω/ω,
the non-spherically-decaying part of the emission only contains the frequencies f = |mω ± Ω|/2π.]

The curve shown in Figs. 8 and 9 decreases monotonically from one (the maximum power) at n = 87 to zero at its
2 ∼ n−2, the value of n at which the curve
minimum (see Fig. 9). As a result of the presence of the extra factor Q ˆϕ
in Fig. 8 attains its high-frequency maximum is somewhat lower than that of the corresponding curve shown in the
inset to Fig. 6. The order of magnitude of this n, however, is still given by (Ω/ω)3: the result earlier encountered in
Sections II and V A in the context of a point source thus applies also to an extended source.

Note that, according to Eqs. (54) and (55), the amplitude of ˜En is independent of the distance rP from the
source throughout the Fresnel zone:
i.e. for rP ≫
[nω/(πc)] max {(r> − r<)2, (z> − z<)2}. This non-spherical decay of the ﬁeld amplitude within the Fresnel zone
is encountered whenever the radiated wave fronts have envelopes; the ﬁeld of ˇCerenkov radiation, for instance, decays

−1 only beyond the Fresnel distance,

it diminishes like rP

The contribution from |µ−ω| = mω − Ω (see Table 1) to the radiation ﬁeld is in this case too small to make a diﬀerence to the
ﬁgure even at these lower frequencies.

like RP

compensated by a steeper dependence of this amplitude on frequency. At the position of an observer who is closer to
the source than the Fresnel distance, the rate of decay of dPn/dΩP with n is by the factor n−2 higher than that of
the power which is radiated in the far zone.

VI. THE RADIATION FIELD OUTSIDE THE PLANE OF THE SOURCE’S ORBIT

A. Asymptotic expansion of the Green’s function

When the observation point is located at a colatitude θP which is diﬀerent from π/2, the leading contribution to
the asymptotic value of the radiation ﬁeld for large ˆRP and large n comes from those volume elements of the source
that lie on the curve described in Eq. (28), the curve we designated as C. For ˆRP ≫ 1, C is coincident with the cusp
curve of the bifurcation surface, Cb, and the source points in question are those which approach the observer with
the speed of light and zero acceleration at the retarded time (see Fig. 2). The integrations with respect to ϕ and r in
Eqs. (24) and (25) can, as a result, be evaluated by the method of stationary phase once again.

It can be seen from the far-ﬁeld limit of Eq. (29) that the cusp curve Cb would intersect the source distribution if θP
lies in the interval |θP − π
2 | ≤ arccos (1/ˆr>), where r> is the radial coordinate of the outer boundary of the source [7].
Hence, the range of values of θP to which the following analysis is applicable would be as wide as (0, π) if the extent
r> − c/ω of the superlumially moving part of the source is comparable to the radius c/ω of the light cylinder.

For θP 6= π/2, the relevant expansion of the phase function g about the locus of its stationary points is that found

in Eq. (37). The counterpart of Eq. (39) is therefore given by

TABLE II: The state of polarization of the radiation in and out of the plane of rotation for diﬀerent orientations of the emitting
polarization current

when the observation point lies beyond the Fresnel distance RP ∼ (nω/c)(r> − r<)2 and n appreciably exceeds
|m ± Ω/ω|. Here, as in Eq. (54), both the additional terms in the Anger functions [Eq. (41)] and the terms associated
with −Ω [Eq. (66)] are negligibly small, so that the Anger functions in | ¯Qz| may be approximated by Bessel functions.
The rate of decay of | ¯Qz| with the harmonic number n depends on the length scale of variations of sr,ϕ,z|C with
z. The smoother the distribution of these source densities in z, the faster would be the rate of decay of | ¯Qz| with n.
In the case of a source with a limited extent in z whose density falls to zero sharply at its z boundaries, such as the
source described in Appendix A, the quantity | ¯Qz| decays like n−1 for large n. The dependence of the poloidal part
of the above dPn/dΩP on n for | ¯Qz| ∼ n−1 diﬀers from the corresponding spectrum shown in Fig. 8 only in that its
amplitude is reduced and its peak is shifted to a slightly lower value of n.
In the high-frequency regime [where Jn−Ω/ω(n) decreases like n− 1

and (69) decay according to a power law n−α: the index α in this power law has the value 8/3 in the plane of source’s
orbit and a value ≥ 11/3 outside that plane.

C. Polarization state of the emitted radiation

Having examined the dependence of the emitted radiation on the polar angle θP , we ﬁnally summarise its po-
larization and indicate how this is related to the direction s of the emitting current within the device described in
Appendix A. This summary, for cases in which one of the cylindrical components of s is appreciably larger than the
other components, is shown in Table 2.

VII. COMPARISON WITH ˇCERENKOV, SYNCHROTRON AND DIPOLE RADIATIONS

The features that the above analysis has in common with that of ˇCerenkov radiation, such as the multi-valuedness
of the retarded time and the presence of an envelope of wave fronts at which the phases of the radiation integrals
are stationary, are easily recognizable. To compare our results with those that are familiar from the analyses of
synchrotron and dipole radiations, however, we need to give a brief parallel account of certain features of these more
conventional emission processes in the present notation.

The electric current density for a uniformly rotating point source (i.e. the source of synchrotron radiation) is

described by

j(r, ϕ, z, t) = q ωδ(r − r0)δ( ˆϕ − ˆϕ0)δ(z − z0)ˆeϕ,

(70)

in which the charge q and the coordinates (r0, ˆϕ0, z0) are all constant. (Recall that ˆϕ ≡ ϕ − ωt.)

Insertion of this source density in Eq. (14) results in

E ≃ q(ω/c)2

R

+π

(71)

where G1 and G2 are deﬁned by the same integral as that in Eq. (20) with Ω = 0. The time dependence of the
integrand in Eq. (71) can once again be expanded into a Fourier series, not because ˆϕ is limited to an interval of
length 2π (here ˆϕ has a single ﬁxed value, ˆϕ0) but because the source density is periodic. Evaluation of the trivial
integrals with respect to (r, ˆϕ, z) thus results in the following counterpart of Eq. (24):

˜En ≃ −in(ω/c)2q r0( ˜G1ˆek + cos θP ˜G2ˆe⊥).

(72)

The deﬁnitions of ˜G1 and ˜G2 in this expression diﬀer from those appearing in Eqs. (25) and (26) only in that in them
Ω = 0, ∆ϕ is (ϕP − π, ϕP + π), and (r, ˆϕ, z) are everywhere replaced by (r0, ˆϕ0, z0).

Once the phase function g in these deﬁnitions is approximated by its far-ﬁeld value [Eq. (30)] and the integrations
with respect to ϕ are performed, we arrive at expressions for ˜Gi whose limiting values for ˆr0 → ˆrC are identical to
the expressions that follow from the far-ﬁeld versions of Eqs. (61) and (62) when Ω = 0. Insertion of the resulting
expressions for ˜G1 and ˜G2 in Eq. (72) then leads to

˜En ∼ in q(ω/c)2(r0/RP ) exp[in( ˆϕ0 − 3

2 π − ˆRP + ˆz0 cos θP )]
0 Jn(nˆr0 sin θP ) cot θP ˆe⊥)],

(73)

i.e. to the familiar ﬁeld of synchrotron radiation (cf. [17]).

The Bessel functions that appear in Eq. (73) have arguments that are smaller than their orders [as in Eq. (43)]
and so decrease exponentially with increasing n: the speed r0ω of the source is subluminal (ˆr0 ≡ r0ω/c < 1) in the
synchrotron process. In contrast, the Bessel functions that appear in the superluminal regime have arguments which
could equal or exceed their orders and so oscillate with an amplitude that decreases algebraically, like n− 1
2 , or
n− 2
3 [see Eq. (44) and the paragraph following it]. Were it to exist, a superluminally rotating point source would
therefore be a much more eﬃcient source of high-frequency radiation than a subluminally rotating one. In fact, as
can be more directly seen from an analysis in the time domain [7], the ﬁeld of a (hypothetical) superluminally moving
point source is inﬁnitely strong, i.e. has a divergent value, on the envelope of the wave fronts that emanate from it.

3 , n− 1

On the other hand, by virtue of being point-like, the source of synchrotron radiation has a spectrum that already
contains all frequencies. Because the spectral distribution of the source in Eq. (70) is independent of frequency,
the spectrum of synchrotron radiation is determined solely by the spectral distribution of its Green’s function. An
extended source is radically diﬀerent in this respect: the spectral content of an extended source of the same type, i.e. a
rotating source with a density j = j(r, ˆϕ, z) whose strength is time independent in its own rest frame, is limited to only
those wavelengths which characterize the length scales of its variations in ˆϕ. Had Ω been zero for the source described
in Eq. (7), the spectrum of this source, and hence that of the radiation that arose from it, would have contained only
the single frequency mω.
[What endows the volume source (7) with the broad—albeit rapidly decaying—spectral
distribution given in Eq. (9) is a new eﬀect, having to do with centripetal acceleration, which would not come into
play unless the source strength varies with time.]

In the subluminal regime, volume-distributed charges and currents are typically weak as sources of radiation: the
contributions from their separate volume elements (those more distant from each other than one radiation wavelength)
would arrive at the observer with diﬀering phases and so would, as a rule, superpose incoherently. The contributions
to the radiation ﬁeld that arise from the source elements located in the vicinity of a stationary point of the optical
distance g, however, are an exception to this rule. In the case of a superluminally moving extended source, where
the derivatives of g have zeros, it is possible for the contributions from source elements that are more distant than
a wavelength to superpose coherently. Not only does the radiation described in Section V receive contibutions from
2
an interval of retarded time that is by a factor of the order of n
3 longer than its period 2π/(nω), but also the source
1
2 and
elements that contribute coherently towards this emission occupy r and z intervals that are by the factors ∼ n
∼ n longer than the wavelength 2πc/(nω) in the Fresnel and the far zones, respectively [see the values of Qr and Qz
found in Eqs. (55) and (56)].

To compare the present results with those that are familiar from the analysis of dipole radiation, let us consider a
case in which the polarization P lies in the z direction (i.e. sr = sϕ = 0) and Ω/ω is an integer. The only non-zero
values of the quantity Q ˆϕ appearing in Eq. (46) are in this case those which occur when n = (Ω/ω) ± m, so that the
amplitude of the radiation ﬁeld ˜En reduces to

| ˜En| ∼ πˆr−1

P |s|(ˆr> − ˆr<)(ˆz> − ˆz<)n2|Jn−Ω/ω(n)|

for n = m + Ω/ω [see Eqs. (45), (54) and (56)].

The ˆϕ extent of the contributing part of the source is of the order of a wavelength, 2πc/(nω). In terms of the total
dipole moment p ≡ (r> − r<)(z> − z<)[2πc/(nω)]P of the contributing source, therefore, Eq. (74) can be written as

| ˜En| ∼ 1

2 rP

−1(nω/c)2|n Jn−Ω/ω(n)p|.

This diﬀers from the familiar expression for the radiation ﬁeld of a stationary dipole in the plane normal to its
2
direction [17] by the factor | 1
3 when n ≫ 1. The diﬀerence can
clearly be traced to the phasing of the array of oscillating dipoles that constitute the present moving source (cf.
Appendix A): the ﬁeld calculated in Section V receives contibutions from an interval of retarded time that exceeds
the period 2π/(nω) of the oscillations of its source by the very same factor.

VIII. EFFICIENCY OF THE RADIATIVE PROCESS

The eﬃciency of the emission process analyzed in Sections V and VI is essentially independent of the way in which
a polarization current with a superluminally rotating distribution pattern is created. Our purpose in this section is
to derive a general expression for estimating the radiation eﬃciency in the high-frequency regime n ∼ (Ω/ω)3 and to
apply the resulting expression to the particular method of implementing the source density (7) that is described in
Appendix A.

If the polarization current density j that acts as the source of the present radiation is produced by the inﬂuence
of an external electric ﬁeld Eext on a polarizable medium with electric susceptibility χe, then the power required for
V j · Eextd3x. The induced polarization P is given by χeEext, so
maintaining j within a volume V would be Pin =
that the polarization current j = ∂P/∂t would have the magnitude |j| ∼ χeΩ|Eext|, where Ω is the dominant frequency
R
in the spectrum of oscillations of Eext and hence j. The input power would therefore be of the order of

Pin ∼ LrL ˆϕLz|j|2/(χeΩ)

in terms of |j|, where we have expressed V as the product LrL ˆϕLz of the length scales of the source distribution in
various directions.

The power that is emitted into the frequency band (∆n)ω centred at nω ∼ (Ω/ω)2Ω is, according to the analysis

in Section V, given by

Pout ∼ c−1Lr

2Lz

2|j|2n−2∆n∆ΩP ,

where the solid angle ∆ΩP is an estimate of the size of the beam that is emitted into the plane of source’s orbit. Note
that r> − r<, z> − z< and Ω|s| in Eq. (57) correspond to Lr and Lz, and |j|, respectively, and that the high-frequency
limit of Jn(n) has the same order of magnitude as (Ω/ω)−1 ∼ n− 1
3 .

The above two expressions for the input and output powers imply that the eﬃciency of the emission process in

question has a value of the order of

Pout/Pin ∼ χe(Lr/L ˆϕ)(Lzω/c)n− 5

3 ∆n ∆ΩP ,

1
3 . The interval ∆n over which the high-frequency component of the radiation
in which we have replaced Ω/ω by n
is emitted is of the same order of magnitude as n [cf. Figs. 6–9]. But the solid angle ∆ΩP in this expression is only
a small fraction of 4π (see below): the estimate in Eq. (77) is valid only within the distance Lz of the plane of the
source’s orbit.

Radiation of frequency nω ∼ (Ω/ω)2Ω can be detected also outside the plane of source’s orbit. Although the value
of ∆ΩP in the corresponding expression for Pout/Pin is of the order of unity when θP 6= π/2 (see Section VI), the
greater steepness of the spectrum reduces the eﬃciency in this case: the dependence of Pout/Pin on n is by a factor
of the order of |Qz|2 ∼ n−2 smaller than that found in Eq. (78) [see Eq. (69)].

Consider an experimental device, such as that described in Appendix A, that is built with a polarizable medium
with the electric susceptibility χe ≃ 10 and electrodes that have the dimensions Lr ≃ L ˆϕ ≃ 5 cm, Lz ≃ 1 cm.
If this device is operated with ω/(2π) ≃ 5 MHz and Ω/(2π) ≃ 300 MHz (the exact value of Ω/ω being diﬀerent
from an integer), then the eﬃciency with which the radiation of frequency nω/(2π) ∼ (Ω/ω)2Ω/(2π) ≃ 1 THz is
generated by each electrode would be of the order of Pout/Pin ≃ 3 × 10−6∆ΩP . Note that (n/π)(Lzω/c)2 ≃ 10−1 and
(n/π)(Lrω/c)2 ≃ 1 in this case, so that the boundary between the Fresnel and far zones lies at a distance from the
source that is shorter than the radius c/ω ≃ 103 cm of the light cylinder [see Eq. (55)]. Beyond the Fresnel zone, the
radiation that is beamed into the cylindrical region z< ≤ zP ≤ z> surrounding the plane of source’s orbit therefore
subtends a solid angle that is smaller than ∆ΩP ∼ Lzω/c ∼ 10−3 radians.

IX. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have investigated the spectral features of the intense localized electromagnetic waves that are generated by
volume polarization currents with superluminally-moving distribution patterns. The analysis is based upon current
practical devices for investigating emission from accelerated superluminal sources [1, 5, 6]; these devices (Appendix A)
produce polarization currents whose distribution patterns rotate and oscillate with two incommensurate frequencies
(ω and Ω). Although the only frequencies entering the production of the emitting currents are mω and Ω (see Table 1),
we ﬁnd that the broadband signals from such devices contain frequencies that are higher than the oscillation frequency
Ω by a factor of the order of (Ω/ω)2. This does not mean that the linear emission process considered here is capable
of generating an output at frequencies that are not carried by its input (the source), thus violating the convolution

23

theorem. What is made possible by this process is to generate radiation of a certain frequency from a source whose
creation does not require that frequency. The spectra of such sources do contain the emitted frequencies [see Eq. (9)].
The high frequencies (none of which are required for the practical implementation of the source) stem from the
cooperation of the following two eﬀects. The retarded time is a multi-valued function of the observation time in the
superluminal regime, so that the interval of retarded time during which a particular set of wave fronts is emitted by a
a volume element of the source can be signiﬁcantly longer than the interval of observation time during which the same
set of wave fronts is received at the observation point. In addition, a remarkable eﬀect of centripetal acceleration is
to enrich the spectral content of a rotating volume source, for which Ω/ω is diﬀerent from an integer, by eﬀectively
endowing the distribution of its density with space-time discontinuities. These results are mathematically rigorous
consequences of the familiar classical expression for the retarded potential.

The spectral distribution for the emitted radiation is summarised in Figs. 8 and 9, and its possible polarization

states are listed in Table 2.

Many features of the radiation that is discussed in the present paper are shared by the high-frequency emissions that
would arise from superluminally moving sources with generically diﬀerent trajectories. An example is a superluminal
source which moves along a straight line with acceleration. In the case of the circularly-moving superluminal source
considered here, the parameter ω determines both the linear velocity of each source element (rω) and its acceleration
(rω2). For a superluminal source whose distribution pattern moves rectilinearly, on the other hand, velocity (v) and
acceleration (a) are two independent parameters.

The emission (δt) and reception (δtP ) time intervals for the waves arising from the source elements that approach

the observer with the wave speed and zero acceleration are in the rectilinear case, too, related by a cubic equation:

δtP = 1

2 (a/c)2[(v/c)2 − 1]−1(δt)3 + · · · ,

(79)

in which v is the retarded value of the source velocity (see Appendix D of [7]). Once again, therefore, a moving source
whose strength ﬂuctuates like cos(Ωt) would generate a ﬁeld which oscillates with a period diﬀerent from that of its
source: with the period [2πa/(cΩ)]2[(v/c)2 − 1]−1(2π/Ω).

In practice, however, there is a crucial diﬀerence between rectilinear and centripetal accelerations. Centripetal
acceleration, as we have seen, enriches the spectral content of a rotating volume source at the same time as giving
rise to the formation of caustics and so the compression of δtP relative to δt. In contrast, rectilinear acceleration
requires for its implementation the very frequencies it endows the source with: the range of frequencies with which
the amplitude of a linearly accelerated source oscillates at a ﬁxed point on its path (within its distribution) is as wide
as the range of frequencies that feature in the Fourier decomposition of its density with respect to time.

The rotating superluminal source described in Eq. (7) can be implemented by an experimentally-viable device [5, 6]
whose construction and operation only entail oscillations at the two frequencies mω and Ω (see Appendix A). As a
source of radiation at frequencies which cannot be normally generated in the laboratory, except by means of large-scale
facilities such as synchrotrons or free electron lasers, the potential practical signiﬁcance of such a device is clearly
enormous [1]; as we have shown in Section VIII, the eﬃciency is large enough for many spectroscopic applications to
be viable.

XI. APPENDIX A: PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SOURCE

The purpose of this appendix is to demonstrate that the polarization described in Eq. (7) can be implemented by
an experimentally viable device [5, 6] whose construction and operation only entail oscillations at the two frequencies
mω and Ω.

Consider a circular ring of radius r, made of a dielectric material, with an array of N electrode pairs that are
placed beside each other around its circumference (Fig. 10). With a suﬃciently large value of N (to be determined
below), it would be possible to generate a sinusoidal distribution of polarization along the length of the dielectric by
applying a voltage to each pair independently. The distribution pattern of this polarization can then be animated,
i.e. set in motion, by energizing the electrodes with time-varying signals. We can synthesize a transverse polarization
wave cos[m(ϕ − ωt)] moving around the ring by driving each electrode pair with a sinusoidal signal whose frequency
is ﬁxed but whose phase depends on the position of the pair around the ring.

24

FIG. 10: View of the experimental device (a) from the side and (b) from above showing an arc of the dielectric medium (dotted
region), its polarized part (darker dotted region), and the electrode pairs (designated by ‘±’ where on and by ‘00’ where oﬀ).

The frequency mω and the wavelength 2πr/m of the travelling polarization wave, and hence its speed rω, can be
controlled at will by varying the frequency mω with which the electrodes are driven and the phase diﬀerence 2πm/N
between neighboring electrode pairs. Introducing the factor cos(Ωt) of Eq. (7) simply corresponds to mixing a second
frequency into the signal driving the electrodes with a phase that is the same for all electrodes.

To estimate the required value of N , let us note that the (ϕ, t) dependence of the polarization that is thus generated

by the discrete set of electrodes described above has the form

in which Π(x) denotes the rectangle function, a function that is 1 when |x| < 1
[For any
given k, the function Π(k − N ϕ/2π) is non-zero only over the interval (2k − 1)π/N < ϕ < (2k + 1)π/N .] When the
electrodes operate over a time interval exceeding 2π/ω, the generated current is a periodic function of ϕ for which
the range of values of ϕ correspondingly exceeds the period 2π.

2 and zero when |x| > 1

The Fourier series representation of the function Π(k − N ϕ/2π) with the period 2π is given by

Π(k − N ϕ/2π) = N −1 +

(nπ/2)−1 sin(nπ/N ) cos[n(ϕ − 2πk/N )].

(A2)

If we now insert Eq. (A2) in Eq. (A1) and use formula (4.3.32) of [23] to rewrite the product of the two cosines in
the resulting expression as the sum of two cosines, we obtain two inﬁnite series each involving a single cosine and
extending over n = 1, 2, · · · , ∞. These two inﬁnite series can then be combined (by replacing n in one of them with
−n everywhere and performing the summation over n = −1, −2, · · · , −∞) to arrive at

in which the order of summations with respect to n and k have been interchanged and the contribution N −1 on the
right-hand side of Eq. (A2) has been incorporated into the n = 0 term: the coeﬃcient (nπ)−1 sin(nπ/N ) has the value
N −1 when n = 0.

The ﬁnite sum over k can be evaluated by means of the geometric progression. The result, according to formula

(1.341.3) of [25], is

(A4)

25

The right-hand side of Eq. (A4) vanishes when (n − m)/N is diﬀerent from an integer. If n = m + lN , where l is an
integer, the above sum would have the value N cos(mωt − nϕ), as can be seen by directly inserting n = m + lN in
the left-hand side of Eq. (A4). Performing the summation with respect to k in Eq. (A3), we therefore obtain

P (ϕ, t) = (mπ/N )−1 sin(mπ/N ) cos(Ωt)

cos[m(ϕ − ωt)]

l6=0(−1)l(1 + N l/m)−1 cos[(N l + m)ϕ − mωt]
(cid:8)
(cid:9)
since only those terms of the inﬁnite series survive for which n has the value m + lN with an l that ranges over all
integers from −∞ to ∞.

(A5)

P

,

We have written out the l = 0 term of the series in Eq. (A5) explicitly in order to bring out the following points.
The parameter N/m, which signiﬁes the number of electrodes within a wavelength of the source distribution, need
not be large for the factor (mπ/N )−1 sin(mπ/N ) to be close to unity: this factor equals 0.9 even when N/m is
only 4. Moreover, if the travelling polarization wave cos(m ˆϕ) that is associated with the l = 0 term has a phase
speed rω that is only moderately superluminal, the phase speeds rω/|1 + N l/m| of the waves described by all the
other terms in the series would be subluminal. Not only would these other polarization waves have amplitudes that
are by the factor |1 + N l/m|−1 smaller than that of the fundamental wave associated with l = 0, but they would
generate electromagnetic ﬁelds whose characteristics (e.g. the peak frequencies of their spectra) are diﬀerent from
those generated by the superluminally moving polarization wave.

The fundamental (l = 0) component of the polarization current that is created by the present device, therefore, has
precisely the same (ϕ, t) dependence as that which is described in Eq. (7) of the main text. Neither the reduction in
its amplitude, that arises from the departure of the value of (mπ/N )−1 sin(mπ/N ) from unity, nor the presence of
the other lower amplitude waves that are superposed on it make any diﬀerence to the fact that the creation of this
fundamental component only entails the two frequencies mω and Ω. Linearity of the emission process ensures that
the radiation generated by an individual term of the series in Eq. (A5) is not in any way aﬀected by those that are
generated by the other terms of this series.

For the distribution pattern of the created polarization current to be moving, it is however essential that the
number of electrodes per wavelength of this pattern, N/m, should exceed 2. For N/m = 2, the l = −1 term becomes
cos[m(ϕ + ωt)] and so represents a wave that has the same amplitude as, and travels with the same speed in the
opposite direction to, the wave represented by the l = 0 term. In this particular case, the fundamental wave is thus
turned into a standing wave.

Note, ﬁnally, that the speed of light is easily attainable: if N = 100 electrodes on a circle of radius r = 1 m are
driven with the frequency mω = 600 MHz and the phase diﬀerence 2πm/N = 0.125 radians, then the distribution
pattern of the induced polarization current would consist of m = 2 wavelengths of a sinusoidal wave train which
would move along the circle with the speed rω = 3 × 108 m/s. Moreover, only an arc of such a circularly shaped
device is needed for generating the present radiation: the pulse that is received at any given observation point arises
almost exclusively from the limited part of the source which approaches the observer with the speed of light and zero
acceleration at the retarded time.

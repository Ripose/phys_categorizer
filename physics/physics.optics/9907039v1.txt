We report the ﬁrst observation of a nonlinear mode in a cylindrical nonlinear Fabry-Perot cavity.
The ﬁeld enhancement from cavity buildup, as well as the large χ(3) optical nonlinearity due to
resonantly-excited 85Rb vapor, allows the nonlinear mode to form at low incident optical powers of
less than a milliwatt. The mode is observed to occur for both the self-focusing and self-defocusing
nonlinearity. In the former case the possible relation of the nonlinear mode to spatial solitons is
discussed.

Self-trapping and self-focusing eﬀects due to the non-
linear response of materials to an applied optical ﬁeld
have been an interesting topic of research from the
early days of nonlinear optics [1]. Most work has been
done in travelling-wave systems, where waveguides and
pulsed lasers are used to achieve large intensities and en-
hanced nonlinear eﬀects. Spatial solitons have become
a widespread paradigm in explaining many nonlinear ef-
fects [2], and have been observed in Kerr [3,4], χ(2) [5,6],
and photorrefractive [7] media. In a cavity geometry, the
main concern has been to explore optical bistability for
its potential applications such as all-optical switching [8].

In a linear cavity there are speciﬁc beam proﬁles that
result in transmissivity, deﬁned as the ratio of the trans-
mitted power to the incident power, being equal to 1.
These are the so-called longitudinal and transverse modes
of the cavity. In a cavity with planar mirrors, only lon-
gitudinal modes exist and the corresponding modes are
plane waves; such a cavity driven by a ﬁnite-sized beam
yields a transmissivity less than unity due to diﬀrac-
tion. Notwithstanding, peaks in the transmissivity exist
for frequencies corresponding to the longitudinal modes.
When the cavity is ﬁlled with a nonlinear medium, other
peaks in the transmissivity occur when the nonlinearity
induces a resonance. We will refer to them as nonlinear
modes. In this Letter we report the observation of a non-
linear mode in a cylindrical Fabry-Perot cavity [9] ﬁlled
with atomic rubidium vapor. The cavity ﬁeld buildup
and resonantly-enhanced nonlinearity give stronger non-
linear eﬀects for a given incident beam intensity than do
the travelling-wave conﬁgurations, permitting our use of
a low-power CW diode laser.

The experiment consists of a cylindrical Fabry-Perot
cavity illuminated with an incident beam Einc, as shown
in Fig. 1, and ﬁlled with a material having a Kerr non-
2). It is assumed that the mirror

curvature in the y-dimension causes strong single-moding
in that direction, and that only one longitudinal mode
is excited. Hence, the ﬁeld conﬁguration in the y and
z directions is fully determined by the cavity geometry.
In the x direction the ﬁeld is determined instead by the
combined eﬀects of self-(de)focusing and diﬀraction. The
ﬁeld envelope within the cavity, in the mean ﬁeld limit,
evolves according to a damped, driven version of the non-
linear Schr¨odinger equation [10]

The experimental arrangement used to observe the
spatial nonlinear mode in a Fabry-Perot cavity is shown
in Fig. 2. A 35 mW, 780 nm Sharp diode laser with
external grating feedback is used as the light source. Af-
ter a variable attenuator and a spatial ﬁlter, the beam
travels through a 3-element cylindrical telescope used to
control the beam waist in the x-direction to between 30
and 300 µm at the cavity input face. A cylindrical mode-
matching lens focuses in the y-direction to eﬃciently cou-
ple into the cavity’s lowest-order transverse mode. The
CCD camera and photodiode D3 image the light leaving
the exit mirror of the cavity. Two additional detectors
are also used in the experiment: detector D1 is used pri-
marily for alignment (it only receives appreciable power
when the beam is collimated in x and mode-matched in
y, at the cavity input face), and detector D2 monitors
input power.

The nonlinear Fabry-Perot cavity itself consists of two
mirrors, one cylindrical and the other planar, separated
by L = 4.5 mm and with
0.007. The cavity length

and alignment are precisely tunable using 3 micrometers
and piezoelectric elements on the planar mirror. The
concave mirror has a cylindrical radius of curvature of
9.8 mm, yielding a mode beam waist (1/e half-width in
ﬁeld proﬁle) of 35 µm in the y-direction. The cavity
is ﬁlled with natural-abundance rubidium vapor at an
1012 cm−3. The

and nonlinear index n2, including Doppler broadening
and all hyperﬁne magnetic sublevels. The arrow in Fig.
3 indicates the line used in the experiment, correspond-
ing to transitions out of the 85Rb, F = 2 ground-state
hyperﬁne level. This line was chosen due to its relative
strength and separation in frequency from other lines.

Figure 4 shows an example of the variation in optical
power transmitted through the cavity as the laser fre-
quency is scanned, for 0.82 mW of incident power (beam
waists of 130 µm and 35 µm in the x and y dimensions,
respectively) and a ﬁxed cavity length L. The transmis-
sion peak marked “linear” corresponds to the ordinary
linear Fabry-Perot transmission resonance. The asym-
metry of this resonance is primarily due to the linear
index and absorption of the atomic vapor. The “non-
linear” peak occurs where the positive n2 is suﬃcient to
shift the red-detuned laser into cavity resonance. This
peak is the nonlinear mode, and the increased atomic
absorption relative to the linear resonance peak is evi-
dent. The “Lamb” feature is due to the forward- and
backward-going cavity beams saturating the atomic ab-
sorption at line center.

Transmission spectra for two diﬀerent values of the
cavity length L are compared in Fig. 5, using the same
incident beam power and dimensions as above. There is
a transmission enhancement in the nonlinear resonance
on the blue side of the atomic line; this is due to the
presence of self-focusing in the x-direction on that side,
and self-defocusing on the other. In the former case the
eﬀect acts against diﬀraction to give more complete con-
structive interference in the forward direction, whereas
in the latter case the nonlinearity acts with diﬀraction
and the transmission is lower. In principle the nonlin-
ear resonance peak on the blue side would be stronger
than the linear ones; that this is not the case is due to
atomic absorption (the vapor is optically thick). Absorp-
tion complicates the spatial aspects of nonlinear mode
formation, but a comparison between the red- and blue-
detuned cases in Fig. 5 is meaningful since absorption is
symmetrical about line center.

The frequency-dependent n2 has interesting scaling
consequences for the spatial nonlinear mode. As inci-
dent beam power is decreased, the nonlinear transmission
peak in Fig. 4 moves toward atomic line center, away
from the linear resonance, since n2 is generally greater
there (after the n2 maximum is reached, the nonlinear
resonance disappears).

and the mode width a decreases (a is expected to scale
roughly as 1/p
). In contrast, spatial soliton forma-

that increase with decreasing power [3,4].

Spatial proﬁles of the transmitted beams for two cases
with equal atomic absorptions and opposite signs of
n2 are shown in Fig. 6, again using 0.82 mW of inci-
dent power and Gaussian beam waists of 130 µm and
35 µm in the x and y dimensions, respectively. As dis-

cussed above the transmission is substantially higher
when n2 > 0 and the width is also narrower in this
case. The wavenumber mismatch ∆k is measured us-
ing c∆k = n0(ωN L)ωN L
n0(ωL)ωL, where ωN L and ωL
are the measured frequencies of the nonlinear and linear
resonances, respectively. We infer n0(ω) by measuring
the frequency splitting of a linear cavity mode tuned ex-
actly on atomic resonance (in our case the mode divides
into two components at detunings of roughly
500 MHz
relative to line center), and extrapolating to other fre-
quencies using the known functional form of n0(ω) in a
Doppler-broadened atomic vapor. The measured non-
linear mode widths σ (deﬁned as the root-mean-square
widths of the intensity proﬁles) for the range 10 m−1 <
< 20 m−1 are 34.7 µm < σ < 39.2 µm for n2 > 0

and 41.7 µm < σ < 44.9 µm for n2 < 0, with the smaller
widths corresponding to larger values of

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new type of spa-
tial nonlinear mode within a cylindrical nonlinear Fabry-
Perot resonator. Some features of this mode are similar
to spatial solitons in travelling-wave systems – numerical
work indicates that the nonlinear mode has structural
stability in the sense that the transmitted beam proﬁle
is insensitive to modest changes in the incident beam
proﬁle. The relationship between the cavity nonlinear
mode and spatial soliton formation would be in interest-
ing topic for further research.

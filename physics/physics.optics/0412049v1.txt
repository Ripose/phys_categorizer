Dependence of the Brillouin precursor form on
the initial signal rise time

Abstract

Propagation of a Brillouin precursor in a Lorentz dispersive me-
dium is considered. The precursor is excited by a sine modulated
initial signal, with its envelope described by a hyperbolic tangent func-
tion. The purpose of the paper is to show how the rate of growth of
the initial signal aﬀects the form of the Brillouin precursor. Uniform
asymptotic approach, pertinent to coalescing saddle points, is applied
in the analysis. The results are illustrated with numerical examples.

Key words: Lorentz medium, dispersive propagation, Brillouin pre-
cursor, uniform asymptotic expansions

1 Introduction

It is well known that if very fast, rapidly oscillating signals propagate in a
real medium, they undergo the dispersion phenomenon. Various frequency
components of a signal propagate with diﬀerent phase velocities, and they are
diﬀerently dumped. As a result, the shape of the signal is distorted during
propagation the signal in the medium. Naturally, this phenomenon is prac-
tically important only at very short times and very high frequencies (of the
order of 1012 Hz and above in the assumed model). In now classical works
Sommerfeld [1] and Brillouin [2, 3] have shown that in the Lorentz model
of a dispersive medium, apart of the main signal two small precursors are
formed. In the asymptotic description of the total ﬁeld these precursors are
interpreted as contributions to the ﬁeld resulting from two diﬀerent pairs of
saddle points. For the Sommerfeld precursor pertinent simple saddle points
vary outside some disc in a complex frequency plane. As the space-time

1

coordinate θ, to be deﬁned later, takes the initial value equal unity, those
points merge at inﬁnity to form one saddle point of inﬁnite order. As θ grows
up to inﬁnity, they separate into two simple saddle points that move sym-
metrically with respect to the imaginary axis towards corresponding branch
points located in the left and the right half-plane, respectively. In the case of
Brillouin precursor, two other simple saddle points vary inside a smaller disc.
As the coordinate θ grows from unity, they move toward each other along
the imaginary axis, coalesce into one saddle point of the second order on the
axis, and then again split into simple saddle points that depart from the axis
and move, symmetrically with respect to this axis, towards corresponding
branch points in the left and the right half-plane, respectively. The location
of the saddle points aﬀects local oscillations and dumping of the precursor. It
depends on the space-time coordinate θ and is governed by the saddle point
equation.

In this paper we conﬁne our attention to the Brillouin precursor, also
called a second precursor (as opposed to the ﬁrst, Sommerfeld precursor).
Fundamental work on this precursor is due to Brillouin [2, 3]. Because of limi-
tations of asymptotic methods then available (now referred to as non-uniform
methods), Brillouin could not correctly describe the precursor’s dynamics for
values of θ corresponding to the coalescence of simple saddle points into one
saddle point of a higher order. With the development of advanced, uniform
asymptotic techniques, complete description of the precursor now got feasi-
ble (Kelbert and Sazonov [4], and Oughstun and Sherman [5]). In the latter
monograph, in addition to the delta function pulse, the unit step-function
modulated signal and the rectangular modulated signal, the authors also
studied an initial signal with ﬁnite rate of growth. In their model, however,
the envelope of the initial signal is described by everywhere smooth function
of time, tending to zero as time goes to minus inﬁnity ([5], Sec. 4.3.4). In
the present paper we consider more realistic excitation which is caused by
an abruptly switched modulated sine signal, vanishing identically for time
t < 0 and being non-zero for t > 0. At t = 0 the derivative of the sig-
nal’s envelope suﬀers a step discontinuity. As t increases, the envelope grows
with a ﬁnite speed, asymptotically tending to its maximum value.
In the
following sections we construct uniform asymptotic representation for the
Brillouin precursor resulting from this sort of excitation, and show how the
speed of growth in the initial signal aﬀects the form of the precursor. We
also illustrate the results with numerical examples.

Assume that in the plane z = 0 an electromagnetic signal is turned on at
the moment t = 0. For t > 0 it oscillates with a ﬁxed frequency ωc and its
envelope is described by a hyperbolic tangent function. Suppose the selected

This initial electromagnetic disturbance excites a signal A(z, t) outside the
plane z = 0. In what follows we will be interested in the ﬁeld propagating in
the half-space z > 0. The problem under investigation can be classiﬁed as a
mixed, initial-boundary value problem for the Maxwell equations.

The exact solution for this speciﬁc form of the initial signal A(0, t) is

than the abscissa of absolute convergence for the function in square brackets
in (4) and ω′ ranges from negative to positive inﬁnity.

Our goal is twofold. First, we shall seek an asymptotic formula for the
second (Brillouin) precursor that results from the excitation A(0, t). In other
words, we shall ﬁnd near saddle points contribution to the uniform asymp-
totic expansion of the total ﬁeld A(z, t). Second, we shall examine how the
speed parameter β in (2) aﬀects the form of the Brillouin precursor.

precursor

Our derivation of the asymptotic formula for the Brillouin precursor is based
on the technique developed by Chester et al. [8] for two simple saddle points

conveniently described in [9] and [10].

points ω1 and ω2 approach each other along the imaginary axis from below

and from above, respectively ([5]). They coalesce to form a second order
saddle point at θ = θ1. Finally, as θ tends to inﬁnity they depart from the
iδ in the right
axis and symmetrically approach the points ω1,2 =
and in the left complex ω half plane, respectively. If n(ω) is eliminated from
(8) then the equation can be represented in the form of an eighth degree
polynomial in ω on its left hand side, and zero on its right hand side. It does
not seem to be possible to solve the equation exactly. In what follows we shall
employ the solution to (8) which was obtained numerically. Alternatively, a
simple approximate solution found in [11] could be used here at the expense
of accuracy in resulting numerical examples.

The ﬁrst step in the procedure is to change the integration variable t in

The equation (13) for γ has three complex roots. Only one root corresponds
to a regular branch of the transformation (9) leading to the conformal map
s(ω). To ﬁnd the proper value of γ we ﬁrst note from (12) that arg ˙ω(0)
can take one of the three values: π/6, 5π/6 or
π/2 corresponding to three
diﬀerent branches of the transformation (9). It can be readily veriﬁed that
for θ < θs both φ(ω1) and φ(ω2) are real valued and φ(ω1) > 0, φ(ω2) <
0. Then it follows from (13) that γ3 > 0. On the other hand, if θ > θs

Provided the function H(s, θ) is regular, the last term in (18) vanishes at
γ, and its contribution to the asymptotic expansion
the saddle points s =

integration by parts of the last term leads to an integral of similar form as
(11) multiplied by λ−1.

The expansion holds for any γ(θ), including γ = 0. This special case
corresponds to coalescing of the two simple saddle points τ =
γ into one
saddle point of the second order. In other words the expansion is uniform
in γ, and hence in θ. It is seen that for γ = 0, i.e. for θ = θs, the algebraic
order of A(z, t) in λ is λ−1/3. This behavior is characteristic of an integral
with a saddle point of the second order.

We see from the above formulas that for θ suﬃciently distant from θs (for
1.5027), the representation
Brillouin’s choice of medium parameters θs ≈
(21) reduces to a simple saddle point contribution from ω2 if θ < θs, and to
a sum of simple saddle point contributions from ω1 and ω2 if θ > θs. In this

8

manner it is conﬁrmed that the saddle point ω1 does not contribute when
θ < θs. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the original contour
of integration in (3) cannot be deformed to a descent path from imaginary
ω = ω1. The algebraic order of A(z, t) in λ is now λ−1/2 because in this
case separate simple saddle points contribute to the expansion. From (27)
and (28) it is also seen that these formulas are non-applicable at θ = θs (i.e.
(ω1,2) = 0. On the other hand the uniform expansion (21)

As the parameter β in (21) increases starting from relatively small values,
the shape of the precursor remains virtually unchanged while its magnitude
grows. This tendency is no longer valid if β enters a transitory interval. In
that interval the shape of the precursor changes and its magnitude rapidly
increases. Above transitory interval, further increase of β leaves the shape
and the magnitude of the precursor virtually constant. The form of Brillouin

Explanation of this behavior lies in the properties of the coeﬃcients c0

the weight with which Airy function and its derivative contribute to the

In Fig. 5 the magnitude of the precursor envelope is plotted against the
parameter β for diﬀerent values of θ. It is seen again that after fast growth
of the envelope magnitude at relatively small values of β, which occurs with
approximately the same rate for all θ, the magnitude reaches a saturation
level at higher values of β. Since the saturation appears earlier at larger
values of θ, the precursor envelope has a tendency to become narrower with
growing β. Additionally, one observes that with growing β the ﬁrst extremum
moves towards larger values of θ. This is a direct consequence of the fact that
the ﬁrst extremum of the Airy function is shifted towards negative values of
its argument as compared to the ﬁrst extremum of the derivative of the Airy
function. It has an additional eﬀect on narrowing the precursor shape.

5 Conclusions

In this paper we have derived the uniform and non-uniform asymptotic rep-
resentations for the Brillouin precursor in a Lorentz medium, excited by an
incident signal of ﬁnite rise time, and well deﬁned, startup time. With the
use of these representations we analyzed the eﬀect of the speed parameter β
on the form and magnitude of the precursor. The results obtained can be
helpful e.g. in applications involving triggering devices that work with signal
amplitudes close to the noise level.
In this paper we did not consider the
problem of smooth transition from Brillouin precursor to the main signal.

We develop an approach to use nanostructured plasmonic materials as a
non-magnetic negative-refractive index system at optical and near-infrared
frequencies. In contrast to conventional negative refraction materials, our
design does not require periodicity and thus is highly tolerant to fabrication
defects. Moreover, since the proposed materials are intrinsically non-magnetic,
their performance is not limited to proximity of a resonance so that the re-
sulting structure has relatively low loss. We develop the analytical description
of the relevant electromagnetic phenomena and justify our analytic results via
2008 Optical Society of America
numerical solutions of Maxwell equations.

Introduction

The electromagnetic response of negative refractive index materials (NIM)1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 has
recently attracted unprecedented attention. Novel optical phenomena, predicted to take place
in these unique systems include reversal of Snell Law, Doppler Eﬀect, Cherenkov Eﬀect,1
aberration-free1, 5, 2 and sub-diﬀraction3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 imaging, and excitation of the new
types of surface and nonlinear waves.8, 18 In particular, realization of NIMs may potentially
lead to fabrication of new types of lenses and prisms,1, 5, 3 new lithographic techniques,9, 17
novel radars, sensors, and telecommunication systems. However, despite the great advantages
NIM has to oﬀer for optical and infrared spectral range, all practical realizations of NIM are
currently limited to GHz frequencies.19, 20, 21, 22

1

Until recently there were two major approaches for NIM design. The ﬁrst one is based
on the original proposal1 that material with simultaneously negative dielectric permittivity
and magnetic permeability must have a negative refraction index. This particular approach
also beneﬁts from the possibility to resonantly excite the plasmon polariton waves at the
interface between NIM and surrounding media, which in turn may lead to sub-diﬀraction
imaging.3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 However, the absence of natural magnetism at high (optical or in-
frared) frequencies23 requires the design and fabrication of nanostructured meta-materials, to
achieve the non-trivial magnetic permeability.20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 As these engineered systems
typically operate in close proximity to resonance, resonant losses become the dominant factor
in system response, severely limiting the practicality of resonant-based systems.12, 13, 11, 10, 30
The second approach for NIM design involves the use of photonic crystals.21, 32, 33, 22, 4 How-
ever, the NIM response in these systems is typically associated with second or other higher-
order bands and requires a complete bandgap between the band in use and the next band.
The dispersion and very existence of the required bandgap are typically strongly aﬀected by
crystal disorder, unavoidable during the fabrication step. The manufacturing of the optical
photonic crystals-based NIM typically requires 3D patterning with 10-nm – accuracy, which
is beyond the capabilities of modern technology.

To address the mentioned-above shortcomings of the traditional NIM schemes, we have
recently introduced an alternative approach to design the NIM structure.7 In contrast to
“conventional” systems, the proposed design does not rely on either magnetism or periodicity
to achieve negative refraction response. It has been shown that the combination of strong
anisotropy of the dielectric constant and planar waveguide geometry yields the required
negative phase velocity in the system.7 Here we present the detailed description of NIMs
proposed in Refs. [7, 34], study the eﬀects related to waveguide boundaries, important for
optical domain, and suggest several nanostructured materials providing the low-loss negative
refraction response at optical and infrared frequencies.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the next Section is devoted to EM wave
propagation in strongly anisotropic waveguides; Section 3 describes the proposed realizations
of the structure; imagining properties of these composites are shown in Section 4; Section 5
concludes the paper.

2. Negative refraction in strongly anisotropic waveguides

We consider wave propagation in the 2D planar waveguide structure shown in Fig. 1. The
propagation in the system is allowed in the y and z directions, while the waveguide walls
> d/2. The waveguide core is assumed to be a homogeneous, non-
occupy the regions
magnetic (µ = 1) material, with a uniaxial anisotropic dielectric constant with dielectric
permittivities ǫ⊥ and ǫk along and perpendicular to the optical axis respectively. The optical

x

|

axis of the core material (C) is assumed to be perpendicular to the direction of the wave
propagation in the media (C
x). Therefore, despite the anisotropy of the system, the eﬀective
refractive index of propagating in the planar geometry waves will be completely isotropic.

k

Fig. 1. Schematic conﬁguration of non-magnetic negative-refraction system

Any wave propagating in the system can be represented as a linear combination of the
waveguide modes.7, 23 An individual mode is deﬁned by its structure along the optical axis
direction (C) and its polarization. Two diﬀerent kinds of modes have to be distinguished.
The modes of the ﬁrst kind (known as TE waves) have their E vector perpendicular to
the optical axis. The propagation of these waves is fully described by the in-plane dielectric
constant ǫk. The modes of the second kind (known as TM waves) have their H vector in
the waveguide plane and are aﬀected by both ǫ⊥ and ǫk. The existence of these TM waves is
crucial for the NIM described here.

In the analytical results presented below we limit ourselves to the case of single-mode
propagation. We note that such a description provides complete information about the linear
properties of the waveguide structure. Indeed, as mentioned above, an arbitrary wavepacket
in the system can be represented as a linear combination of modes. In our numerical simu-
lations discussed in Section 4 we utilize this property to compute the imaging performance
of the system.

2.A. Waveguide with perfectly conducting walls

As it has been shown in Ref. [7], the propagation of a mode in a planar waveguide can be
described by the free-space-like dispersion relation:

y + k2
k2

z = ǫνk2,

(1)

where ǫ is ǫk for TE modes and ǫ⊥ for TM ones, ky and kz are the propagation components of
the wavevector, k = ω/c with ω and c being the free-space angular frequency of the radiation,

3

and speed of light in a vacuum; the propagation constant ν is given by

and the parameter κ deﬁnes the mode structure in x direction.

As it directly follows from Eq. (1), the phase velocity of a propagating mode is equal to

ν = 1

κ2
ǫkk2 ,

−

vp = n k,

(2)

(3)

where the eﬀective refraction index n2 = ǫν. Note that similar to the case of the plane wave
propagation in free-space, the refraction index contains a product of two (mode-speciﬁc)
scalar constants. A transparent structure must have both propagation constants of the same
sign. The case of positive ǫ and ν corresponds to “conventional” (positive refraction index)
material. The case of negative ǫ and ν describes NIM.7, 34 The NIM behavior can be easily
illustrated by comparing the Poynting vector Sz and the wavevector kz as shown below.

Similar to any waveguide structure, the mode in the system described here can be re-
lated to the x proﬁle of the longitudinal ﬁeld component (the detailed description of such a
dependence is given in Ref. [7]). To better illustrate the physical picture behind the mode
propagation, in this section we present the results for the important case of perfectly conduct-
ing waveguide walls. In this case, the EM energy is conﬁned to the waveguide core and the
longitudinal ﬁeld has a cos(κx) or sin(κx) proﬁle depending on the symmetry with respect
to the x = 0 plane, with κ = (2j + 1)π/d for symmetric and κ = 2πj/d for anti-symmetric
modes respectively with j being the integer mode number. The deviation from this idealized
picture due to ﬁnite conductance of the waveguide material does not change the physical
picture described in this section, and for the practical case of “good” metals (Ag,Al,Au) at
near-IR to THz frequencies can be treated perturbatively. Results of such a perturbation
approach are presented in the Section 2b.

system described here and the free-space propagation, the EM energy of any propagating
wave is always positive and contains equal contributions from the electric and magnetic
components of the ﬁeld.

It is also seen that the TE mode is in some sense very similar to the conventional plane
wave propagating in the isotropic homogeneous dielectric. Namely, (i) energy density of the
TE waves is exactly equal to that of the plane waves; (ii) there is no wave propagation in
material with ǫk < 0. In contrast to this behavior, the sign of the dielectric permittivity
alone does not impose limitations on the propagation of TM modes.

Another important characteristic of the energy transport in the EM system is the average

It is clearly seen from Eq. 6 that the relation between the direction of the phase velocity
and energy ﬂux is deﬁned by the sign of the dielectric constant (for a given mode polarization)
– positive ǫ means n > 0 propagation, while ǫ < 0 signiﬁes the NIM case. Of course, for this
relation to take place, we must require the medium to be transparent – both propagation
constants ǫ and ν must be of the same sign. As it can be seen from Eq. (1), the NIM condition
can be satisﬁed only for TM wave and only in the case of extreme anisotropy of the dielectric
constant of the core material (ǫkǫ⊥ < 0). The feasibility of the fabrication of such unusual
materials will be discussed in the Section 3.

2.B. The eﬀect of ﬁnite wall conductance

In this section we consider the practical realization of the system described above, in which
the anisotropic core material is surrounded by metallic walls. The electromagnetic properties
of metals at high (GHz to optical) frequencies are dominated by the dynamics of the free-
electron plasma-like gas. Following the approach described in e.g. Ref. [35] it is possible to
write down the high-frequency eﬀective permittivity of metal in Drude form:

(6)

(7)

ǫm(ω) = ǫ∞ −

Ω2
pl
ω(ω + i τ )

,

where the constant term ǫ∞ describes the contribution of the bound electrons, τ is responsible
for EM losses due to (inelastic) processes, and Ωpl = Ne e2
meﬀ is the plasma frequency with Ne, e,
and meﬀ being the free-electron concentration, charge, and eﬀective mass respectively. Note
that for ω < Ωpl/√ǫ∞ the permittivity of the metal becomes negative ǫ′
m < 0 (here and
below single and double prime (′; ′′) denote the real and imaginary parts respectively). For
most of “good” metals (Ag,Al,Au) the plasma frequency is of the order of 10 eV and ǫ∞ ≈
1,
which means that ǫ′
m is negative from optical to GHz frequencies. The losses, given by the
parameter ǫ′′

1 are typically small in these spectral ranges.

Similar to the case of perfectly conducting waveguide walls, the structure of the modes in
the system can be still derived from the dependence of the longitudinal (z) ﬁeld component

on the x coordinate, which has cos(κx) or sin(κx) behavior depending on its symmetry. The
exact value of the mode parameter κ is given by the requirement of the in-plane (y, z) ﬁeld
components continuity throughout x =
d/2 planes. For symmetric (cos) mode proﬁle, we
obtain:

the previous Section. As we previously noted, these values correspond to the well-known
condition of zero mode magnitude at the waveguide boundary. In the limit of suﬃciently
it is possible to ﬁnd the correction to the above values of the mode parameter κ.

As the mode parameter κ plays a role of an inverse conﬁnement length of the mode in x
direction, the negative κ correction signiﬁes the “mode expansion” into the waveguide wall
region. Such a mode expansion is illustrated in Fig. 2.

The immediate eﬀect of such a change in the mode structure is the change of the eﬀective

where ν0 = 1
for the T M polarization has to be selected positive for ǫ⊥ > 0; ν > 0, and negative for
ǫ⊥ < 0; ν < 0.

Penetration of the mode into the waveguide wall region has another eﬀect on the wave
propagation. Namely, the ﬁnite value of the ǫ′′
m introduces an additional (with respect to
the core material) absorption into the system. As a result, the magnitude of a mode will
exponentially decay as it propagates through the system. Such an attenuation can be related
n′′kz). In the limit
to the imaginary part of the eﬀective refractive index through E

of small absorption in the metal (ǫ′′

3. Anisotropic nanoplasmonic composites

We now consider the fabrication perspectives of the material with strong optical anisotropy
required for NIM waveguide core region. A number of naturally occurring materials with
the required properties exist at THz or far IR frequencies. Some examples include Bi and
Sapphire.34 Unfortunately, no known material exhibits anisotropy exceeding 30% at optical or
infrared spectral range. Here we propose to take advantage of a new class of nano-engineered
media, known as meta-materials.36 In these composites, nanostructured particles are used as
meta-atoms to achieve the desired EM properties.

To realize the strong optical anisotropy we propose to use a combination of plasmonic or
polar particles (providing the negative permittivity) and dielectric media (having ǫ > 0). If
the characteristic size of inhomogeneities and their typical separation are much smaller than
the wavelength of incident radiation, the EM response of the composite structure can be
described in terms of the eﬀective dielectric constant ǫeﬀ :23

< D(r) >α=< ǫ(r)α,βE(r)β >= ǫeﬀ α,β < E(r) >β,

(12)

7

where the brackets (<>) denote the averaging over the microscopically-large (multi-particle),
macroscopically small (subwavelength) spatial area, Greek indices denote Cartesian compo-
nents, and summation over repeated indices is assumed. Since the size of a particle a typically
enters Maxwell equations in the combination ka,23 all size-related eﬀects play a minor role
in the considered here “quasi-static” averaging process. Therefore, we note that the compos-
ites proposed below are highly tolerant with respect to size variation. Also, since the eﬀects
described here are obtained in eﬀective medium approximation, the desired response does
not require any periodicity of the particle arrangement and only the average concentration
has to be controlled during the fabrication step.

Below we present two meta-material designs of the strongly anisotropic composite for

optical and infrared spectrum ranges.

3.A. Layered system

We ﬁrst consider the permittivity of a stack of interlacing plasmonic (Ag,Au,Al,. . .) or po-
lar (SiC) (ǫpl < 0) and dielectric (Si,GaAs,. . .) (ǫd > 0) layers. We assume that the layers
are aligned in the waveguide (y, z) plane (see Fig. 3). As noted above, the absolute thick-
ness of the layers is not important (as long as it is subwavelength), and only the average
concentration of plasmonic layers Npl plays the role.

Fig. 3. The schematics of the layered structure described in the text

To compute ǫeﬀ we note that the Ey, Ez, and ǫEx have to be continuous throughout the

system,23, 41, 42 leading to:

ǫ⊥ < 0 can be easily achieved in the layered system, the

described here typically have substantial absorption1, and therefore have a limited range of
applications.10, 30

On the contrary, the materials with ǫk < 0, ǫ⊥ > 0 (achieved, for example by a repeated
deposition of Ag-Si layers) form low-loss media. While this conﬁguration has a positive refrac-
tion index, it may be potentially used to concentrate propagating modes in subwavelength
areas.7, 43

3.B. Aligned wire structure

The array of aligned ǫpl < 0 nanowires embedded in the dielectric (ǫd > 0) host, schematically
shown in Fig. 5 is in some sense a counterpart of the layered system described above. In fact,
the boundary conditions now require the continuity of the Ex ﬁeld, along with the solution of
z plane. While in the general case the analytical solution of
quasi-static equations in the y
this problem is complicated, the case of small plasmonic material concentration is adequately
described by the Maxwell-Garnett approximation:23, 37, 38, 39

To illustrate the validity of the MG approximation, we numerically solve the Maxwell
equations in the planar geometry using the coupled-dipole approach (CDA), described in
detail in Refs. [28,39,40]. In these calculations the composite is represented by a large number
of interacting point dipoles, and the resulting dipole moment distribution is related to the
eﬀective dielectric constant. Fig. 5 shows the excellent agreement between the numerical
simulations and the analytical result [Eq. (14)].

The eﬀective dielectric constants for some composite materials are presented in Fig. 6.
Note that in contrast to the layered system described above, these wired composites have
extremely low absorption in the near-IR-NIM regime - in a way solving the major problem
with the “conventional” design of optical LHMs.

4.

Imaging Properties of non-magnetic optical NIMs

To illustrate the imaging performance of the proposed system we calculate the propagation
of a wavepacket formed by a double-slit source through the 5µm-long planar layer of 5%
Ag, 95% SiO2 wire-based NIM-core described above [see Fig. 6(a,b)], embedded in the Si
waveguide. We select the thickness of the dielectric core to be d = 0.3µm, and assume the
excitation by the telecom-wavelength λ = 1.5µm. The Eqs. (10,14) yield the following values
of the refraction index: n(+)

2.6, n(LHM )

2.6 + 0.05i.

To calculate the resulting ﬁeld distribution we ﬁrst represent the wavepacket at the z =
0 plane as a linear combination of the waveguide modes.7, 34 We then use the boundary
conditions at the front and back interfaces of the NIM region to calculate the reﬂection and

transmission of individual mode. The solutions of Maxwell equations are then represented
as a sum of solutions for the individual modes.

To better illustrate the imaging properties of the system and distinguish between the eﬀects
of negative refractive index and material absorption, we ﬁrst neglect losses in the NIM core.
The resulting intensity distribution in the system is shown in Fig. 7(a). The image formation
in the focal plane (z = 10µm) of the far-ﬁeld planar NIM lens is clearly seen.

In Fig. 7(b) we compare the imaging through the planar NIM lens with and without the
material absorption and demonstrate that the presence of weak loss, although it reduces the
magnitude of the signal, it does not destroy the far-ﬁeld imaging. Similar to any far-ﬁeld
imaging system,23, 10, 30 the resolution ∆ of the non-magnetic NIM structure presented here
is limited by the internal wavelength: ∆

0.3µm [see Fig. 7(c)].

5. Conclusions

In conclusion, we presented a non-magnetic non-periodic design of a system with negative in-
dex of refraction. We have further proposed several low-loss nanoplasmonic-based realizations
of the proposed structure for optical and infrared frequencies. We have presented analyti-
cal description of the eﬀective dielectric permittivity of strongly anisotropic nanostructured
composites, and showed the excellent agreement of the developed theory with results of nu-
merical solution of Maxwell equations. Finally, we have demonstrated the low-loss far-ﬁeld
planar NIM lens for λ = 1.5µm with resolution ∆

0.3µm.

30. It can be shown10, 31 that for losses {ǫ,µ}′′

|{ǫ,µ}′| > 0.3 even the near-ﬁeld resolution of the

NIM-based system is smaller than that of conventional near-ﬁeld optics.

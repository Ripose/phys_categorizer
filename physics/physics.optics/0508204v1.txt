Abstract

A novel, 3-dimensional, convex, multi-pass optical cavity with partially-
chaotic ray dynamics is presented. The light is localized near stable, long-
path length trajectories supported by the cavity, and beam diﬀraction is
suppressed by the phase space barriers between the regions of regular and
chaotic ray dynamics that are generally present in partially-chaotic sys-
tems. For a centimeter-size cavity, the design supports meter-scale optical
path lengths, suggesting future applications in trace gas detection. An
exemplary cavity has been fabricated from a hollow, gold-coated, acrylic
shell. Our measurements using a HeNe laser and a pulsed red diode laser
for characterization of the cavity beam pattern and optical path length,
respectively, conﬁrm the theoretically predicted optical dynamics and the
ability of the cavity to support meter-scale path lengths.

Optical cavities supporting long path lengths are widely used in applications
such as trace gas sensing, where sensitivity strongly correlates with path length.
With optical path lengths on the order of ten meters, gas detection sensitivities
on the order of parts per million or better are achieved. Currently, the cavities
most commonly used to generate long path lengths are multi-pass cells such as
White Cells and Herriott Cells.[1] These devices operate by reﬂecting a beam
between multiple mirrors over many passes, and are designed under the premise
of integrable (regular) beam dynamics. While such devices successfully provide
for long optical path lengths, they have a number of drawbacks. In particular,
these systems consist of multiple focusing components, take time to align prop-
erly for long path lengths, and are typically several tens of centimeters or even
a meter in length. A compact, robust, cost-eﬀective device with straightforward
optical alignment would be ideal for spectroscopy applications requiring porta-
bility and durability. In the present Letter, we present a compact, economical,
monolithic optical cavity with straightforward alignment.

The cavity design takes advantage of the partially-chaotic ray dynamics in
optical systems with reduced symmetry. When the cavity shape is deformed
from symmetrical geometry, the corresponding phase space generally shows

1

a mixture of stable and chaotic regions.[2] This behavior can be accurately
described using the standard methods of nonlinear dynamics,[3, 4, 5] and is
the foundation of the recently demonstrated high-power semiconductor micro-
cylinder lasers.[6] The barriers that separate diﬀerent stable and chaotic regions
in the phase space cannot be crossed by any classical (ray) trajectory - thus
leading to light conﬁnement within the phase space region into which the light
beam was initially injected. While wave eﬀects can violate such purely “clas-
sical” restrictions, the corresponding evanescent processes have exponentially
small probability and in the case of centimeter-scale device can be essentially
ignored. The advantage of using the partially-chaotic cavity is thus two-fold.
First, it will assure light conﬁnement near a stable trajectory if light is injected
into the cavity’s region of stability. Second, the resulting inaccessibility of the
chaotic regions to the injected light allows eﬃcient gas input/output for the
cavity if the corresponding gas ports are placed in such inaccessible regions.

While various topologies of the desired stable multi-pass trajectory are pos-
sible, the optimal design corresponds to the orbit that has the same angle of
incidence at all reﬂection points - as this would allow an eﬃcient use of ultra-
high reﬂection interference coatings, thus minimizing the energy loss on every
reﬂection.
In particular, this requirement is satisﬁed by the ‘”bow-tie” orbit
shown in Fig. 1(a, b). In terms of practical issues of manufacturing the cav-
ity, the desired geometry still has cylinder symmetry - as it would allow the
fabrication of the device using precision diamond turning.

The geometry we have therefore chosen for our compact, quasi-chaotic,
multi-pass cavity, is the three-dimensional (3D) quadrupole, deﬁned in terms of
its average radius R0 and the deformation parameter ǫ as R = R0 (1 + ǫ cos 2θ)
in the standard spherical coordinates (R, θ, φ). It can be visualized as an oval
rotated around its major axis z - see Fig. 2(a). The resulting ray dynamics for
this cavity is partially-chaotic – as demonstrated in the phase space plots (also
known as “Poincar´e Surfaces of Section (SOS)) in Fig. 1(d,e) that visualize
the evolution of the ensemble of rays of varying input angles and positions. As
clearly seen from Fig. 1 (d,e), the proposed design supports the stable bow-
tie orbit - its stability region is clearly seen as the “chain” of two “islands”
centered at the same value of sin χ (where χ is the angle of incidence). This
(three-dimensional) bow-tie trajectory can be visualized by oﬀsetting the “2D”
bow-tie above the 2D quadrupole plane, in a manner indicated in Fig. 2(a).

Due to the conﬁnement of the trajectories to the corresponding (stable)
region of the phase space, the injected rays whose angle of incidence and position
reside in one of the islands remain coupled in the stable mode over the course
of multiple reﬂections - oscillating near the bow-tie orbit (see Fig. 1 (b)) while
the plane that contains the orbit rotates around the axis of symmetry of the
device (with the angular velocity determined by the angular momentum Lz with
respect to the axis of symmetry z. Rays injected at initial parameters outside
the stable islands, follow chaotic trajectories, and eventually ﬁll the entire cavity,
as shown in Fig. 1(c).

With a single aperture in the cavity positioned at a reﬂection point of the
bow-tie trajectory drawn in Fig. 1(a), light can be coupled into the cavity with a

from the input angle.

); i.e.

Due to the axial symmetry of the proposed device, the dynamics in the cor-
responding dimension (given by the polar angle φ - see Fig. 2(a)) is marginally
stable (or metastable).
for the rays injected with diﬀerent values of
the angular momentum Lz, the deviations growth linearly with the number
of bounces (as opposed to exponential growth for unstable/chaotic dynamics).
This implies that the beam spot size – while being limited by the size of the
island in the the θ-direction, – growth linearly with time in the φ-direction.[8]
While this metastable condition allows for beam divergence over the course of
multiple reﬂections, long path lengths can still be supported if the linear growth
factor is small and only present in one direction, minimizing divergence (to the
limit set by the beam diﬀraction).

An experimental cavity has been constructed to test theoretical stability

at a small angle to this plane. (b) Photograph of the cavity under illumination

the cavity.

projections and multiple-pass dynamics, with R0 = 2.54 cm, and ǫ = 0.16. The
cavity comprises two halves of an acrylic plastic shell carved out by diamond-
turning , and gold is uniformly deposited inside the cavity.[7] A circular aperture
2 mm in diameter is drilled along the line φ = 54.4◦ at one point in the cavity.
Light from a 15 mW HeNe laser or red laser diode is coupled into the cavity
using a spherical lens with a focal point of 50.8 mm mounted on an x − y − z
translation stage, and the precision of the stage allows to inject the light into
an island of stability. Light coupled out of the cavity is focused through a pair
of spherical lenses, detected by a high-speed Si detector, and analyzed using a
digital oscilloscope.

The advantage of using a visible laser is that the light is partially transmitted
through the gold coating, so that the beam at points of reﬂection is visible
from the outside of the cavity (See Fig. 2(b)). Thus, the beam shape as a
function of the number of reﬂections can be assessed and used to characterize
the cavitys stability. By correlating the experimental spot position (Fig. 2(b))

4

with multiple-pass ray dynamics from Fig. 1, the number of reﬂections the beam
has undergone before reﬂecting oﬀ a particular position can be determined.
Measurements indicate that the spot size in the quadrupole plane grows quickly
to a constant width over the course of multiple reﬂections, conﬁrming stability
in the bowtie mode. In the direction perpendicular to the quadrupole plane,
spot size is measured to increase linearly as a function of number of reﬂections,
conﬁrming marginal stability in the system for rotation around the cavity’s axis
of cylindrical symmetry.

Path lengths in the cavity can be measured by a pulse time delay setup. The
experimental concept involves coupling short pulses of light with well-deﬁned
temporal envelopes into the cavity. First, the cavity is oriented to allow just a
single pass in the quadrupole plane before light is coupled out of the resonator
and detected. Then the cavity is oﬀset from the quadrupole plane to allow an
input pulse to undergo multiple bow-tie passes before coupling out and being
detected. By measuring the time delay between the multiple pass and single
pass pulse edges, the path length diﬀerence is measured. In the experiment,
an AlGaInP diode laser with 30 mW maximum power is used and pulsed with
an HP pulse generator. The temporal pulse widths are 40 ns, the duty cycle
is 0.01%, and the pulse edge rise times are on the order of nanoseconds. Noise
in the data is reduced by averaging over 512 consecutive pulses by use of a
digital oscilloscope, and the background signal obtained without light pulses is
subtracted. Normalized time-resolved pulse data for ﬁve diﬀerent multiple-pass
schemes is given in Fig. 3(a). From left to right, the pulse edges are for multiple-
pass schemes of 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8 passes. (b) shows the time delay between 1
and 8 passes. The measured time-delay is 5.0 ns, which corresponds to 152
cm of path length in addition to a single 2D quadrupole pass. Given that the
single bow-tie mode in the 2D quadrupole plane measures 17.2 cm, the total
path length in the orbit is ∼ 169 cm.

Run-time measurements for longer path lengths, while possible, were diﬃcult
due to the gold transmission and absorption losses and scattering eﬀects due to
surface roughness in the cavity. In future, this issue can be addressed by use of
ultra-high-reﬂectivity interference coatings instead of the partially transmitting
gold ﬁlm, as well as by using longer wavelengths.

To summarize, we presented a novel approach to compact multi-pass optical
cavities based on partially-chaotic ray dynamics. The stability of the spot size of
a properly injected beam over multiple reﬂections was conﬁrmed experimentally
with a custom-built cavity, and path lengths on the order of a meter were
measured.

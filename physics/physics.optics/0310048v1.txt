Symbol of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator in 2D
diﬀraction problems with large wavenumber

Consider the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator

in the exterior problem for
the 2D Helmholtz equation outside a bounded domain with smooth boundary.
Using parametrization of the boundary by normalized arclength, we treat
as a
N
pseudodiﬀerential operator on the unit circle. We study its discrete symbol.

N

We put forward a conjecture on the universal behaviour, independent of shape
. The
and curvature of the boundary, of the symbol as the wavenumber k
conjecture is motivated by an explicit formula for circular boundary, and conﬁrmed
numerically for other shapes.
It also agrees, on a physical level of rigor, with
Kirchhoﬀ’s approximation. The conjecture, if true, opens new ways in numerical
analysis of diﬀraction in the range of moderately high frequencies.

Introduction

This work is a part of research aimed at an accurate and robust numerical algorithm for
diﬀraction problems in mid-high frequency range, where the standard Boundary Inte-
gral Equation methods fail due to large matrix size and, more importantly, to numerical
contamination in quadratures. A natural idea to use the knowledge of geometric phase
and to separate fast oscillations from slowly varying amplitudes has been converted to
a practical method [1],[2] with recent enhancements [7]. A drawback of that approach
occurs in the presence of ﬂattening boundary regions, where Kirchhoﬀ’s amplitude be-
comes singular. From numerical analyst’s point of view, a method that has problem
with small curvature is anti-intuitive.

The point of our approach is to look for an object in theory whose high-
frequency asymptotics stands ﬂattening well and isn’t sensitive to convexity
assumptions. We suggest that the symbol of Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator might
be such an object.

We consider the 2D case and don’t claim a ready-made extension of our results in
3D. As a technical reason, we need a well deﬁned full symbol of a pseudodiﬀerential
operator on a compact manifold (the boundary). In the 2D case, the boundary is a
closed curve, so a special version of the PDO theory with discrete frequency variable is
applicable, which attends to smooth kernels and doesn’t require partitions of unity.

Disc of arbitrary radius

Let u(r, φ; R, k) be a solution of Problem (1) with wavenumber k outside a circle of
radius R. Then u(r/R, φ; 1, kR) is a solution of Problem (1) with wavenumber kR
outside the unit circle. The Dirichlet data for the two functions (as functions of φ) are
identical, fR,k(φ) = f1,kR(φ). The Neumann data are related via
|r=R = R−1 g1,kR(φ).
N

Correspondingly, the symbol of the operator

gR,k(φ) = ∂ru(r, φ; R, k)

for the disk of radius R is

σR(n, k) = R−1 σ1(n, kR),

so the limit formula (6) of Lemma holds with n = n(k, t) = [kRt]. Equivalently, we
can write the argument of the limit function σlim(t) as

Periodic pseudodifferential operators

The reader can probably see what conclusion we are about to draw from the above
examples. Let us complete technical preparations, then formulate the main conjecture.
Recall brieﬂy and informally some basic notions regarding pseudodiﬀerential oper-

ators on the unit circle S. See [3], [11] for a full account of the topic.

Let a(φ, n) be a function on S

Z, which satisﬁes certain regularity conditions.
The function a(φ, n) is the discrete symbol of the periodic pseudodiﬀerential operator
(PPDO) A deﬁned by the formula

×

Af (φ) =

a(φ, n) ˆf (n)einφ.

Xn∈Z

Here f (φ) is a 2π-periodic function and ˆf (n) its Fourier coeﬃcients.

The symbol σ(n) introduced in (3) does not depend on φ. Such symbols are called

constant symbols, and corresponding operators are shift invariant.

The theory of PPDO applies not only to operators on the unit circle, but to oper-
ators on any smooth closed curve, since functions on closed curved can be identiﬁed
with 2π-periodic functions by reparametrization.

The symbol a(φ, n) of a PPDO A typically has an asymptotic expansion in decreas-

ing powers of n. The principal symbol is the leading term in the asymptotics

Theory of PPDO is somewhat simpler than the general theory of pseudodiﬀerential
operators on compact manifolds (see e.g. [12]). The deﬁnition of a general PDO uses
partition of unity. Only the principal symbol can be deﬁned globally.

Reconstruction of an operator by its symbol in the general theory assumes that
operators with smooth kernels are neglected.

double asymptotics (in ξ and k), since the behaviour of the neglected part with respect
to k is not controlled. Correspondence between operators and symbols in the theory of
PPDO with discrete symbols is strict and preserves full information in both directions.

Thus the symbol for any boundary parametrized by the arclength is asymptotically

that at high frequencies the diﬀraction process is well localized and (13) takes place for
any disc — see (9), (10) — and doesn’t refer to curvature.

Our conjecture has no problems with tangent rays and shadow regions since the
formula doesn’t depend on the boundary data. In particular — in the case of a plane
incident wave — the direction of incidence has no eﬀect on our claim. One can argue
that the conjecture has no backing in the case of non-convex scatterers. In that case it
is supported by numerical results; see the last section of the paper.

A program used for these calculations had a 12 byte long type for ﬂoating point
operations (long double in C). The results obtained with a 8 byte long arithmetics
(C’s type double) were nearly identical. So in the considered example numerical errors
due to a limited precision are not an issue.

Conclusion

The main result is the proposed Limit Shape Formula (13) for the symbol of the
Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for the standard 2D diﬀraction problem (1) with smooth
boundary. This asymptotics is independent of the boundary data, of the boundary cur-
vature, and of convexity assumptions. The limit function σlim(t) deﬁned in (6) varies
const n/k, except near t = 1. These features make the ap-
slowly in its argument t
proximation (13) useful for numerical completion of the boundary data set (u
|Γ),
which yields the solution u and the radiation pattern by Green’s formula. This ap-
proach includes and supersedes the classical Kirchhoﬀ approximation. We believe that

the asymptotics can be enhanced and next, curvature-dependent, term(s) can be found
from the theory of pseudodiﬀerential operators. In the especially important region, a
narrow neighbourhood of t = 1, methods for a ﬁeld near a caustic [4] can be used.

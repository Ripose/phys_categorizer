Abstract: The nonlinearity of a transmission ﬁber may be compensated by a specialty ﬁber
and an optical phase conjugator. Such combination may be used to pre-distort signals before
each ﬁber span so to linearize an entire transmission line.

A ﬁber-optic transmission line is a nonlinear channel due to the material nonlinear eﬀects. Fiber nonlinearity
has become one of the major limiting factors in modern optical transmission systems [1, 2]. Distributed
Raman ampliﬁcation and various return-to-zero (RZ) modulation formats may be employed to reduce the
nonlinear impairments, but merely to a limited extent. It is known that the nonlinearity of one ﬁber line may
be compensated by that of another with the help of optical phase conjugation (OPC). However, all previous
proposals and demonstrations [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] work partially in ﬁghting the ﬁber nonlinearity. They either are
specialized to only one aspect of the nonlinear eﬀects, or fail to work in the presence of dispersion slope
or higher order dispersion eﬀects. Still open to date is an important question: does ﬁber nonlinearity really
impose a fundamental limit to the channel capacity? This paper introduces the notion of scaled nonlinearity,
which together with the application of OPC, provides a negative answer to the above question.

Consider an optical ﬁber stretching from z = −L to z = 0, along which the optical birefringence is either
vanishingly weak to avoid the eﬀect of polarization mode dispersion (PMD), or suﬃciently strong to render
the ﬁber polarization maintaining. A set of optical signals are wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) and
injected into the ﬁber. For simplicity, it is assumed that all the signals are co-linearly polarized, and coupled
into one polarization eigen state when the ﬁber is polarization maintaining. The signals may be represented
by a sum of scalars E(r, t) = F (x, y)
, where F (x, y) is the transverse

When the signals become intense, the nonlinear interaction as evidenced in (2) can badly distort them and
make the carried information diﬃcult to retrieve. Unlike the case of linear channels [10], simply raising the
signal power may not necessarily increase the capacity of a nonlinear channel. Nevertheless, the nonlinear

interaction among the signals is deterministic in nature that can be undone in principle. The question is how
to implement a physical device which undoes the distortion. Suppose there is a specialty ﬁber stretching from
z = 0 to z = L/R, R > 0 being a constant, in which q(z, ω) is the optical propagation constant. Let a set
of WDM signals E′(r, t) = F ′(x, y)
propagate in the specialty ﬁber,

∀z ∈ [0, L/R], C 6= 0 being a constant, then equations (3) are reduced from (2) by taking the complex
conjugate, making a substitution z → −Rz, and replacing A∗
n(z, t)/C. Mathematically,
it says that A′
−n(−Rz, t), ∀n ∈ Z, solve (3), which govern the nonlinear propagation in the
specialty ﬁber. Interpreted physically, if OPC is applied after the transmission but before the specialty ﬁbers
to convert the signals An(0, t), n ∈ Z, into A′
n(0, t) = CA∗
−n(0, t), n ∈ Z, then the specialty ﬁber will
propagate the optical signals in a reversed manner with respect to the transmission ﬁber. At the end, the
specialty ﬁber outputs signals A′
−n(−L, t), n ∈ Z, which are replicas of the initial signals
before entering the transmission ﬁber up to complex conjugation. The ﬁbers and optical signals on the two
sides are said to be mirror symmetric about the OPC, although in a scaled sense. Note that the specialty
ﬁber would amplify light in correspondence to the attenuation in the transmission ﬁber and vice versa.

Fig. 1. A specialty ﬁber and a transmission ﬁber are in scaled mirror symmetry about the point of OPC. The
shaded ﬁber segments are located at −z and Rz respectively, 0 ≤ z ≤ L/R, with the parameters q(2)(−z),
α′(−z), γ′(−z), g′(−z) proportional to β(2)(Rz), α(Rz), γ(Rz), g(Rz) as in (4-7).

So OPC and a specialty ﬁber with parameters designed according to (4-7) could perfectly compensate the
nonlinearity of a transmission ﬁber, if not for the ever-existing noise, especially that incurred when the
signal amplitude is low, destroying the mirror symmetry. A better designed link would start with a specialty
ﬁber that boosts the power of the optical signals, followed by OPC, then a ﬁber for transmission in which
the signal power decreases, as shown in Fig.1. In the ﬁber locations not too far from the OPC, the signal
power is relatively high to minimize the eﬀect of the optical noise, which usually originates from ampliﬁed
spontaneous emission (ASE) and quantum photon statistics. However at the two ends of the link, the eﬀect
of the optical noise could become substantial. A simple but fairly accurate model may assume that optical
noise is incurred exclusively at the two extreme ends of the link, dispersive and nonlinear signal propagation
is the only eﬀect of the inner part of the link. In this model, the nonlinearity of a segment of transmission
ﬁber with z1 ≤ z ≤ z2 is fully compensated by the portion of the specialty ﬁber with −z2/R ≤ z ≤ −z1/R,

2

∀z1, z2 ∈ [0, L]. In particular, the entire link from z = −L/R to z = L is equivalent to a linear channel
impaired by additive noise at the two ends. If W is the total optical bandwidth of the input WDM channels,
then the OPC should have a bandwidth wider than W to cover the extra frequency components generated
through wave mixing in the specialty ﬁber. With nonzero dispersion ﬁbers, however, the extra bandwidth due
to wave mixing may hardly exceed 100 GHz, which is often negligible in comparison to the total bandwidth
W of several, even tens of THz. Thus the linearized link may be assumed to have the same bandwidth limit
W throughout, applicable to which is Shannon’s formula for channel capacity [10], C = W log2(1 + S/N ).
Obviously, many of such linearized links may be cascaded to reach a longer transmission distance, and the
entire transmission line is still linear end-to-end in spite of the nonlinearity existing locally in the ﬁbers.

Using a commercial software, computer simulation has been carried out to test the proposed method of
nonlinearity compensation. As in Fig.1, the simulated link consists of a specialty ﬁber, an OPC, and a
transmission ﬁber that is of the negative nonzero dispersion-shifted type, 200 km long, with loss coeﬃcient
α = 0.2 dB/km, dispersion D = −8 ps/nm/km, dispersion slope S = 0.08 ps/nm2/km, eﬀective mode area
Aeﬀ = 50 µm2, Kerr and Raman coeﬃcients that are typical of silica glass. The specialty ﬁber is a dispersion
compensating ﬁber of the same material, but with parameters (α′, D′, S′) = 20×(−α, D, −S) and A′
eﬀ = 12.5
µm2. The nonlinearity of the specialty ﬁber can be switched on and oﬀ. ASE noise is added at the two ends
of the link. The input consists of four WDM channels at 100 GHz spacing, all RZ modulated at 10 Gb/s
with 33% duty. The power of all optical pulses is peaked at 100 mW when entering the transmission ﬁber.
Fig.2 shows the received signals without and with nonlinearity in the specialty ﬁber respectively. Showing
no nonlinear degradation, only the eﬀect of ASE noise, the graph on the right side demonstrates clearly the
compensation of optical nonlinearity.

pre-compensated by the specialty ﬁber. Right: both dispersion and nonlinearity are pre-compensated.

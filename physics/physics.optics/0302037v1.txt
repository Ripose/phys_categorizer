Variational Analysis for Photonic Molecules

Bin-Shei Lin
Division of Nanoscience, National Center for High-Performance Computing, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan

A new type of artiﬁcial molecule is proposed, which consists of coupled defect atoms in photonic
crystals, named as photonic molecule. Within the major band gap, the photonic molecule conﬁnes
the resonant modes that are closely analogous to the ground states of molecular orbitals. By
employing the variational theory, the constraint determining the resonant coupling is formulated,
that is consistent with the results of both the scattering method and the group analysis. In addition,
a new type of photonic waveguide is proposed that manipulates the mechanism of photon hopping
between photonic molecules and oﬀers a new optical feature of twin waveguiding bandwidths.

In the past decade, photonic defects have attracted
much attention owing to their scientiﬁc and technological
applications in the realization of high-Q microcavities or
high transmittance waveguides (WGs) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
A defect atom can be embeded in a photonic crystal by
perturbing the dielectricity of a selected crystal “atom”,
that has photons with certain frequencies locally trapped
within the band gap of the surrounding crystal struc-
ture. If defect atoms are embeded by design to form the
so called line defect then, within the band gap, it may
provide a mechanism of photon propagation via hopping
from one defect to its neighbors with a high transmit-
tance [8, 9, 10]. Consequently, the integrated optical
circuits of functional elements can be realized through
skillful integration of photonic defects and WGs, and is
expected to oﬀer potential applications in telecommuni-
cation [11, 12].

A point of importance but of much less attention is
that the formation of photonic WGs are conventionally
considered as arranging the desired defect atoms along a
line, however, this approach has limited the potential of
development. We suggest a broader vision of the manip-
ulation of photonic defects through the investigation of
photonic molecules that are deﬁned as follows. In pho-
tonic crystals, the defect atoms are closely arranged to
form a structure that is similar to a real molecule − So
named because, within the major band gap, the resonant
modes conﬁned by such a structure are closely analogous
to the ground states of the molecular orbitals (MOs) of
the real molecule. For example, Fig. 1 (a) shows a pho-
tonic molecule named as the photonic benzene, whose
defect modes are shown in Fig. 3. By employing the
variational theory, the constraint determining the reso-
nant coupling of photonic molecule is formulated, that is
consistent with the results from those of both the scat-
tering solution and the group analysis.
In particular,
manipulating the mechanism of photon hopping between
photonic benzenes can provide the function of guiding
photons along the benzene chain with a high transmit-
tance, and presents a new optical feature of twin waveg-
uiding bandwidths, as shown as Fig 4.

Because of the importance on interpreting the mecha-

nism of defect coupling, there are mainly two solid-state
theoretical approaches, the tight-binding (TB) [8, 9, 13]
and Wannier function methods [14, 15, 16], have been ap-
plied to study the coupled cavities. The photonic version
of TB method extends the idea of linear combination of
atomic orbitals (LCAO), in which the defect modes are
analogous to the atomic wave function, and suppose that
only the nearest-neighbor couplings are relevant to ﬁnd
the dispersion relation for waveguide mode. For the lat-
ter, the localized defect modes are expanded by Wannier
functions to calculate their intensity variations, where the
Wannier functions are calculated by plan-wave method or
TB method coupled with supercell approximation. Here,
another powerful approach of variational analysis is in-
troduced for many defect-atoms system.

Considering ﬁrst an electric resonant mode Ed(r) of a
single defect in a ﬁnite-size photonic crystal, the Maxwell
equations obeyed by Ed(r) can be further simpliﬁed as

ˆHEd(r) = ǫd(r)(ωd/c)2Ed(r),

(1)

where the operator ˆH is deﬁned as −∇2 for the 2D system
or ∇ × ∇× for the 3D system. Also, ǫd(r) denotes the
dielectric constant of the single defect system, and ωd is
the eigenfrequency of the eigenmode Ed(r). Those modes
occure within the major band gap are most concerned in
this paper, and can be taken as real and normalized by

< Ed(r)|ǫd(r)|Ed(r) >def=

ǫd(r)Ed(r)·Ed(r)dr = 1.

Zdomain

For the same photonic crystal considered in (1) but
embedded with a photonic molecule, the allowed resonant
modes are assumed as a superposition of the individual
defect mode. Basically, it is analogous to the idea of
LCAO, namely

En(r) =

CniEd(r − Ri),

(2)

nd

Xi=1

where En(r) is the nth resonant mode of the photonic
molecule, nd the number of defect atoms, Cni the unde-
termined coeﬃcient, and Ri the coordinates of the ith

defect atom. Similarly, En(r) satisﬁes (1) but with ǫd(r)
replaced by the dielectric constant ǫpm(r) of the photonic
molecule system, and ωd replaced by the frequency ωn of
the eigenmode En(r). That is

highly localized around its defect site, the ﬁeld overlap
between diﬀerent defect atoms is small and the overlap
integral Sij can thus be approximated as

2

ˆHEn(r) = ǫpm(r)(ωn/c)2En(r).

(3)

Equation (2) associated with (3) is a linear variational
problem. Assigning diﬀerent coeﬃcient Cni to each mode
Ed may create diﬀerent En, but the structure of photonic
molecule will decide which resonant modes are allowed.
This inference will be reﬂected on restricting Cni to sat-
isfy the minimum of functional frequency, deﬁned as

Namely, Ω is equivalent to the familiar Rayleigh-Ritz

Therefore, hopping terms can be classiﬁed according to
the separation of the coupled defects. Here, only three
relevant hopping terms are considered. Moreover, un-

Equation (5) indicates that the allowed resonant fre-
quencies in a given photonic molecule are dominated by
hopping integrals. Furthermore, these hopping terms are
dependent upon the dielectric structure of the photonic
molecule. Therefore, every resonant mode is character-
ized by photonic molecule and exhibits diﬀerent optical
transmittance. To check the accuracy of Eq. (5), we ﬁrst
apply Eq. (5) to the photonic benzene, that yields

(7)
Obviously, Eq. (7) indicates that there are two doubly-
degenerate frequencies with n = 1, 5 and n = 2, 4, and
two nondegenerate frequencies with n = 3 and n = 6,
thus, four high-Q resonant frequencies will occur within
the major band gap. From the view point of the sym-
metry group , the photonic benzene belongs to the point

group C6v for the 2D or D6h for the 3D systems, whose
irreducible representation Γ on defect sites can be re-
duced to the decomposition Γ = A1 + B2 + E1 + E2 or
Γ = A2u + B2g + E1g + E2u, respectively. Exactly speak-
ing, it again illustrates two doubly degenerate modes of
E1 (or E1g) and E2 (or E2u), and two nondegenerate
modes of A1 (or A2u) and B2 (or B2g). Furthermore,
these predictions are also consistent with the numeri-
cal solution of Eq. (3), that is calculated by scattering
method (cf.
[17]). The resultant transmission for the
2D case is plotted in Fig. 2, and the allowed resonant
modes are shown in Fig. 3, where we consider a 2D ﬁnite-
size hexagonal photonic crystal with a dielectric contrast
ratio 8.4/1.0 (rod/background) and a radius-to-spacing
ratio 0.4/4.0. The defect radius ρ is taken as zero.

Figure 2 shows four nomalized resonant frequencies
0.369, 0.375, 0.455 and 0.508, that split from ωd = 0.419
due to the defect coupling in a photonic benzene. By sub-
stituting these ﬁve frequencies into Eq. (7), the hopping
terms β1, β2 and β3 can be calculated by least-squares
method, and they are 0.178, 0.051 and −0.010. Table
I summarizes four cases of defect sizes, in which the all
values of hopping parameters achieve the accuracy of two
decimal places for Eq.
It clearly shows that the
larger the defect radius is, the smaller hopping parame-
ters. This means that the defect couplings in photonic
benzene become weaker as the defect radius is increased.
Moreover, when the defect radius ρ is increased up to
about 0.2, the property of four transmission peaks disap-
peares, owing to that the shallow perturbation of dielec-
tricity for defect atoms will create shallow modes [1].

(7).

In fact, Eq. (3) is equivalent to the eﬀective Shr¨odinger
equation of H¨uckel π−electron theory (developed in 1931
[18]),
if we make the resonant modes of 3D photonic
benzene be analogous to the π−electrons of benzene
molecule. However, Eq. (3) is much simpler. Theoret-
ically, the π-electrons arise from a planar unsaturated
organic molecule whose MOs can be divided into the
σ and π MOs according to the reﬂection symmetry in
the molecular plane. Both systems belong to the same
point group D6h and have the same degeneracy (cf. [19],
p.261), but possess completely diﬀerent meanings. Con-
ceptually, the photonic molecule acts as a perfect model
of artiﬁcial molecule, since the resonant modes are much
easier to be realized than the bonding orbitals of real

molecule. Similar phenomena can also be found in the
quantum-dot molecules [20] or the coupled pairs of GaAs
cavities (note that these systems are also termed as pho-
tonic molecule, cf. Bayer et al.
[21]). Fig. 3 shows the
lowest resonant modes allowed in a 2D photonic benzene
with ρ = 0.0, and they are labelled according to the sym-
metry species of the group C6v, which are analogous to
the six π MOs of benzene molecule but is lacking of the
C1h symmetry.

Most importantly, by applying the modular concept
of photonic benzene can create photonic WGs, and we
called these WGs as benzene WGs.
In the chemistry
terminology, benzene WGs can be classiﬁed as π and σ
types corresponding to the bonding types between two
real benzene rings, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (b) & (c).
It is remarkable that transmission of the benzene WGs
reveals the special feature of a twin waveguiding band-
widths marked as △ωα and △ωβ, where △ωα < △ωβ,
as shown in Fig. 4. This means that the benzene WGs
are able to provide two working bandwidths at the same
time. In addition, Fig. 5 shows that a TM light with the
E2 mode travels through a 90o bend from the π type to
the σ type. Of course, the same phenomenon can also be
observed in other modes.

In conclusion, we suggest a new and practicable idea
for the manipulation of photonic defects, that includes
the so-called photonic molecule and benzene WG. The
optical properties of photonic molecules has been inves-
tigated by variational theory, which shows that the al-
lowed resonant frequencies inside a photonic molecule
are dominated by hopping parameters through the con-
straint (5). Taking the photonic benzene as an example,
six resonant modes with two doubly-degenerate and two
nondegenerate are found and veriﬁed by both of the scat-
tering method and group theory. Especially, the benzene

WGs created by the modular manipulation of photonic
benzenes are demonstrated to possess the interesting fea-
ture of a twin waveguiding bandwidths. Namely, benzene
WGs provide two working bandwidths at the same time
and make the function of guiding photons more ﬂexible.

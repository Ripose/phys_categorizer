Abstract. A possibility of tuning the phase of the third-order Kerr-type nonlinear
susceptibility in a system consisting of two interacting metal nanospheres and a
nonlinearly polarizable molecule is investigated theoretically and numerically.
It is
shown that by varying the relative inter-sphere separation, it is possible to tune the
phase of the eﬀective nonlinear susceptibility χ(3)(ω; ω, ω, −ω) in the whole range from
0 to 2π.

Recent dramatic advances in nanofabrication made it possible to design, arrange
and assemble nanoparticles with great precision. Optical and, more generally,
electromagnetic properties of nanostructures have been of great interest in the past
decade [1–5].
In particular, physical eﬀects due to giant local ﬁeld enhancement are
subject of active current research [5–8]. In this respect, nanoparticles of noble metals,
especially silver, proved to be very useful. The remarkable optical propertied on silver
nanostructures are explained by the strong, resonant interaction with electromagnetic
ﬁelds in the visible and near-IR spectral range and by very small Ohmic losses.

The strong enhancement of local ﬁelds in small spatial areas is the consequence
of two factors: the heterogeneity of a nanostructure on a subwavelength scale and the
resonant character of interaction of the electromagnetic ﬁeld with the nanostructure.
Both features are, in principle, present even in the case of a single isolated nanosphere.
However, the eﬀect becomes much stronger in aggregated nanospheres due to the eﬀect of
plasmon hybridization [9]. In this case, ampliﬁcation of local ﬁeld can become suﬃciently
large to make possible detection of Raman radiation from single molecules, as was
demonstrated experimentally in [10]. The Raman enhancement factor (|E|/|E0|)4 in
the center of a junction between two nanospheres (E and E0 - the local and the external
ﬁelds in the junction, respectively) was calculated to be 5.5 · 109 for a 1nm gap between
two silver spheres of 60nm radius each at λ = 497nm [11]. Even larger enhancement, up
to 1013, was predicted in the so-called nanolens - a linear chain of several nanospheres
of diﬀerent size [6].

The primary focus of research in single-molecule spectroscopy has been on non-
coherent optical processes such as Raman scattering. In this paper I consider a coherent
nonlinear eﬀect, namely, degenerate third order nonlinearity, and demonstrate that, by
changing the geometry of a nanostructure, it is possible to control not only the amplitude
of the nonlinear response but also its phase (relative to the phase of the incident ﬁeld).
The nonlinear Kerr eﬀect described by the third-order susceptibility χ(3)(ω; ω, ω, −ω)
is responsible for corrections to absorption and refraction. The possibility to control
the phase and tensor structure of χ(3)(ω; ω, ω, −ω) can have numerous applications, for
example, in quantum nondemolition measurements via the optical Kerr eﬀect [12].

Consider a simple physical system shown schematically in Fig. 1. Here a
nonlinearly-polarizable molecule is placed in the center of symmetry of two spheres.
The radius of each sphere is denoted by a and the width of the gap (surface-to surface)
by 2h. Thus, for example, if a = 50nm and 2h = 1nm, which is the smallest physical gap
considered in Ref. [11], we have h/a = 0.01. The system is excited by an external ﬁeld
with some frequency ω and wavelength in vacuum λ = 2πc/ω, linearly polarized along
the axis of symmetry. The latter coincides with the z-axis. The whole system is assumed
to be suﬃciently small compared to λ and we work in the quasistatic approximation.
Further, we use the Drude formula for the dielectric function of metal, namely,

ε = ε0 − ω2

p/ω(ω + iγ) .

The following parameters are used in the simulations: ε0 = 5, γ/ωp = 0.002, and the

value of ωp is unspeciﬁed. Note that the dielectric function of silver in the anomalous
dispersion region is well described by choosing ωp ≈ 4.6sec−1 (λp ≈ 136nm). Finally, we
assume that the metal nanoparticles are embedded in a transparent host medium with
the refraction index nh = 2 (εh = 4).

Because of the axial symmetry, the dipole moment induced in the molecule is
parallel to the z-axis. The third-order nonlinear correction to the dipole moment
oscillating at the same temporal frequency as the incident ﬁeld is given by

Here Ez is the amplitude of local electric ﬁeld at the location of the molecule and E0
is the amplitude of the external ﬁeld. Note that, even if we assume for simplicity that
E0 is purely real, Ez can be complex. In general, there can be an arbitrary phase shift
between the local and the external ﬁelds. The eﬀective nonlinear polarizability α(3)
eﬀ is
related to α(3) by

Since G is, in general, complex, it can inﬂuence not only the magnitude but also the
phase of the eﬀective third-order polarizability. Below, we calculate G numerically
and show that its phase can be varied in its whole range by changing the inter-sphere
separation.

To calculate the local ﬁeld in the gap, Ez, we expand the polarization inside each
sphere in the quasistatic vector spherical harmonics X(1)
lm (r − ri).
Here i = 1, 2 indexes the nanospheres, ri are the radius-vectors of the spheres’ centers,
ψ(1)
lm (r) = (r/a)lYlm(ˆr), and Ylm(ˆr) are spherical functions of the polar angles of the unit
vector ˆr. Polarization inside each sphere can be written as

ilm(r) = (la)−1/2∇ψ(1)

where the unknown coeﬃcients Cilm must be found from the standard boundary
conditions applied at the surface of each sphere, or alternatively, from the integral
equation formalism as described in [13]. From general considerations, it is clear that
Cilm obey a system of linear equations which, in the quasistatic limit, was obtained
in [14] and simpliﬁed in [15]. In general, this set of equations has the form

(1/χ − W )|Ci = |Ei ,

where χ = (3/4π)[(ε − εh)/(ε + 2εh)] is the coupling constant, W the electromagnetic
interaction matrix, and |Ei is the appropriate right-hand side deﬁned by the external

and |Pni are the eigenvectors of W with corresponding eigenvalues wn. Here Esz is the
z-component of the scattered ﬁeld on the axis of symmetry (the x- and y-components
are zero). The total local ﬁeld Ez is a superposition of the incident and scattered ﬁelds:

Ez = E0 + Esz .

Note that we have used the spectral approach to solving (6). In other words, instead of
directly inverting 1/χ − W , we seek eigenvectors and eigenvalues of W and then obtain
the solution in terms of these quantities for an arbitrary coupling constant χ.

The matrix W is of inﬁnite size and in practical calculations must be truncated.
The truncation order lmax required to obtain an accurate solution depends on the inter-
sphere separation. Although, for any separation, there exist an inﬁnite number of modes,
most of them are antisymmetric [16, 17] or, equivalently, dark [18]. A dark mode is
not coupled to the homogeneous external ﬁeld because the scalar product hE|Pni is
either exactly zero or very small. Correspondingly, the input of a dark mode to sum
(10) is negligible. Modes which are not dark are referred to as luminous [18]. For
a ﬁnite value of h, there is a ﬁnite number of luminous modes and the spectrum of
eigenvalues wn which correspond to these modes is discrete. However, as h decreases,
the number of luminous modes grows and the intervals between consecutive values of
corresponding eigenvalues wn approach zero. When the two spheres touch, the spectrum
becomes continuous and, strictly speaking, can not be adequately described at any ﬁnite
truncation order. However, for practical purposes, the matrix still can be truncated,
as long as the resultant discrete density of states approximates the true continuous
function with suﬃcient precision. The latter condition depends on the relaxation in the
system and is very diﬃcult to satisfy for silver in the near-IR spectral region due to the
very small non-radiative relaxation. In the simulations presented below, the minimum
ratio h/a is equal to 0.01.
In this case, all luminous modes are obtained with very
high precision at relatively modest truncation orders. The results reported below were
obtained at lmax = 800 and convergence with machine accuracy was veriﬁed by doubling
this number.

Now we turn to the numerical results. First,

in Fig. 2, we plot the spectral
dependence of the factor |Ez/E0|2 in the center of the inter-sphere gap for diﬀerent
relative separations h/a. It can be seen that a “resonance band” exists in the spectral
region whose bounds depend on the ratio h/a. For h = 0.01a, resonance interaction
takes place for 0.15 . ω/ωp . 0.33. For h = 0.32a, the resonance band is smaller,
0.25 . ω/ωp . 0.32. We will be interested in the frequencies which lie in the resonance
band for the smallest value of h considered, namely, h = 0.01a.

Figure 2. The ratio |Ez/E0|2 in the center of the inter-sphere gap as a function of
ω/ωp for diﬀerent relative inter-sphere separations.

In Figs. 3-5, we show the parametric plots of the complex enhancement factor G for
the following values of the ratio ω/ωp: 0.20, 0.25 and 0.32. In the case ω/ωp = 0.20, the
most dramatic change of G happens when h changes from 0.36a to 0.41a. The phase
of G changes in this interval of h from ≈ π/4 to ≈ 3π/4. Overall, the phase of the
enhancement factor can be tuned from ≈ 0 to ≈ π by tuning h in the whole considered
interval.

Much more control over the phase of G can be attained for ω/ωp = 0.25, as shown
in Fig. 4. It is interesting to note that the parametric curve shown in these ﬁgure is
approximately self-similar, consisting of several almost closed loops which can be seen at
diﬀerent scales. The phase of G changes in the whole interval from 0 to 2π. Qualitatively
similar curve was also obtained for ω/ωp = 0.30 (data not shown).

Perhaps, the most interesting curve is obtained at ω/ωp = 0.32 (Fig. 5), although
the magnitude of G is not as large for this value of ω/ωp as in Figs. 3-4. The parametric
plot of G is in this case a spiral. The phase of G changes monotonously from ≈ 0
to ≈ 5π. Thus, the curve makes more than two full revolutions around the origin in
the complex plane. By varying the parameters in the Drude formula and the refractive
index of the host medium, it was found that the spiral shape of the curve is typical when
ω/ωp is close to the right bound of the resonance interaction band (data not shown).

Thus, we have shown that by changing the inter-sphere separation h from 0.01a to
0.32a it is possible to change the phase of the enhancement factor G, and, consecutively,
that of the eﬀective nonlinear polarizability α(3)
eﬀ in its whole range. Some limitations
of the model used in this paper must be mentioned. First, we did not account for
direct electromagnetic coupling between the nonlinearly polarizable molecule and the
nanospheres, nor did we take into account the nonlinearity of the metal itself. The latter
eﬀect can be signiﬁcant. Further, did not account for the fact that the electric ﬁeld in
the gap is not constant but can change on the scales comparable to molecular. Although
all these factors are important if one seeks to calculate the nonlinear response of the

system with precision, inclusion of all these complications would make the theoretical
description intangible. On the other hand, the physical eﬀect described in this paper
does not originate due to any of the approximations listed above. Instead, it is explained
by the resonant nature of the interaction between the electromagnetic ﬁeld and the
nanosystem. When the spacing between the nanospheres is tuned, diﬀerent resonance
modes are excited in the bisphere aggregate. This results the change of the relative phase
between the local ﬁeld in the gap Ez and the external ﬁeld E0 and the characteristic
dependence of the enhancement factor G on h which is illustrated in Figs. 3-5. Since
the resonance nature of interaction is not altered by the eﬀects mentioned above, it
is reasonable to expect that the ﬁne tuning of the third-order nonlinear response is
achievable in nanosystems speciﬁcally engineered for that purpose.

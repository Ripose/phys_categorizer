Abstract

We report the discovery of a “dark area theorem,” a new quantum optical
relation for propagation of unmatched pulses in thick three-level Λ-type me-
dia. We deﬁne dark area and derive the dark area theorem for a coherently
prepared and inhomogeneously broadened lambda medium. We also obtain
the ﬁrst equation for the spatial evolution of the dark state amplitude prior
to pulse-matching.

Many advances have been made recently in controlling quantum systems with a pair
of near-resonant optical pulses under conditions of relatively long-preserved two-photon co-
herence among three quantum states. Key parameters being controlled include laser pulse
intensity, frequency, duration, shape, timing and detuning. Well-known techniques and phe-
nomena such as Rabi splitting [1], spectroscopic dark-states [2], pulse matching [3], and
anti-intuitive excitation [4] have been exploited, with consequences including EIT (electro-
magnetically induced transparency [5]), LWI (lasing without inversion [6]), state-selective
molecular excitation (STIRAP [7]), and demonstrations of slow light [8] and fast light [9],
to mention only a few prominent examples.

However, in practically every instance a strong ﬁeld is used to control a near-resonant
medium so that a weak ﬁeld can penetrate or amplify or excite transitions in a way normally
forbidden. These are thin absorber applications, in the sense that the strong ﬁeld’s evolution
in the medium is ignored.

The understanding of pulse evolution in two-level media is much more complete. The
McCall-Hahn Area Theorem [10] is available to provide a unifying picture of the way the
medium acts back self-consistently. Even in situations where coherence is not complete, the
two-level Area Theorem is a guide to the key role of self-consistent back action, and may
suggest inverse applications in which the medium controls the ﬁeld [11], i.e. thick absorber
applications.

In the present note we report the discovery of a new nonlinear propagation law for
unmatched pulses in a three-level medium. This new propagation law, which is appropriately
labelled a Dark Area Theorem, takes the form:

where the constant φ and the “dark area” θD are deﬁned below. Here α and α′ are the
conventional Beer’s Law absorption coeﬃcients for the two transitions shown in Fig. 1(a).
The fundamental equations, from which the dark area theorem is derived, are familiar.

2dgEg/¯h, etc. The angular brackets are deﬁned by
the (assumed unchirped) ﬁelds: Ωg ≡

F (∆)(. . .)d∆, which is an average over detunings arising from inhomogeneous
h
broadening, where F is a normalized distribution, taken symmetric and Gaussian in the
examples calculated below, with F0 setting the time scale for inhomogeneous relaxation. We
take the same F for the two transitions. The µ parameters are related to the α’s in the
standard way for inhomogeneously broadened media: α = πµF0, and α′ = πµ′F0, and we
do not assume µ = µ′. Finally, we have deﬁned local-time coordinates τ and ζ in the frame
propagating with velocity c in the medium: cτ

≡
In addition to the two ﬁeld equations there are three equations for the atomic amplitudes
g, g′ and a. We prefer to write these equations in the dressed “bright-dark” basis sketched

However, we have discovered that the

2nπ ambiguity of this deﬁnition of θ has physical
meaning, and that the meaning is related to the spatial evolution of θ. This is a double
surprise - that the ambiguity is physical and that the dressing angle should be treated as a
propagation variable, actually as an “area” corresponding to the dark Rabi frequency:

and second by substituting this integral into the right side of (9), where the resulting dou-

theorem makes asymptotic predictions for the pulses, and assigns distinct physical content
to each of the branches of its solution shown in Fig. 2.

As in the two-level case, the three-level area theorem does not predict pulse shapes, and
an inﬁnite variety of shapes can be asymptotically stable. In Fig. 3 we show the evolution
of two initially unmatched and temporally oﬀset pulses, with initial areas 1.5π and 4.8π.
Propagation over 20 Beer’s lengths shows highly non-trivial shifting and reshaping.
In
addition one can check that the ﬁnal matched pulses conform to the dark area theorem’s
asymptotic rule: their amplitude ratio is given by tan(φ/2).

A further surprise arising from the use of the dressing angle as a propagation variable
is that the spatial behavior of the bright and dark amplitudes is already speciﬁed by the
dressing transformation itself. In the τ > T > F0 regime, where the space-time behavior of B
and D is a self-consistent reponse to the pulses, we can write ∂B/∂ζ = (∂B/∂θD)(∂θD/∂ζ),
and a similar equation for D . With the aid of (11), we can thereby obtain a new equation
for D2 alone: ∂D2/∂ζ = αD2(1

D2), with the elementary solution:

(13)

where Din here means the value of D at the arbitrary position of incidence ζin. The new D2
equation itself already shows that the alternate solution D = 0 is not stable, which is exactly
the conclusion reached in our earlier numerical study of the distinction between SIT -type
and EIT -type propagation [15].

More important, the analytic solution given here also provides the ﬁrst compact pre-
dictive expression [16] for spatial evolution of the dark state toward matched pulses, and
conﬁrms what has been known empirically, that the real pulses ﬁnally must become matched,
which is the same as the limit D2
1. The straight lines of data points given in the inset
in Fig. 4 show the agreement between a completely numerical solution obtained from the
original equation set (2) - (6) and the simple expression (13) predicted by dark area theory.
The two diﬀerent lines of points emphasize that for diﬀerent times τ /T ∗ in the pulse the
2 will attain the predicted asymptotic straight-line form more or less
spatial evolution of
quickly.

To summarize, we have presented the explicit form of an area theorem that is, to the
best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst to be found for propagation in thick three-level media. The
most important ingredient of the derivation was the discovery that θD, twice the dark-state
dressing angle, is the key propagation variable for physical pulses in coherently prepared
three-level media [17]. We have demonstrated that, in the domain of rapid inhomogeneous
relaxation, approximate expressions for the response of the medium can be found, and that
they lead directly to compact expressions for the spatial evolution of bright and dark state
amplitudes, as in eqn. (13), which were previously unknown. Numerical solutions show that
these simple expressions are highly accurate.

We expect applications of the dark area theorem to be numerous and interesting. One
can show that the singular points of both tan θD and cot θD determine the number of zero-
crossings of the physical pulse envelopes Ωg and Ωg′, such as the two that appear spon-
taneously in Fig. 3 around αL = 5 and 10. Such zero-crossings appear closely related to
phase jumps previously observed in Raman solitons [18]. The inclusion of inhomogeneous
broadening makes the dark area theorem capable of addressing three-level echo eﬀects [19].
Application of the singularity rules mentioned above will lead to non-trivial analogs of the
McCall-Hahn rule for split-up of 2nπ pulses. In conclusion, we mention again that the full
= µ′. A detailed examination of (1) must
expression of the theorem in eqn. (1) allows µ
be given elsewhere [20], along with the spatial development of the bright ﬁeld ΩB and other
elements missing here for lack of space.

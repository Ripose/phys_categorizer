Metaphoric optical computing of ﬂuid dynamics

Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125

Mankei Tsang and Demetri Psaltis

Compiled March 23, 2011

We present theoretical and numerical evidence to show that self-defocusing nonlinear optical propagation can be used to
compute Euler ﬂuid dynamics and possibly Navier-Stokes ﬂuid dynamics. In particular, the formation of twin vortices and the
K´arm´an vortex street behind an obstacle, two well-known viscous ﬂuid phenomena, is numerically demonstrated using the
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation.

Introduction

A. Philosophy of metaphoric computing

Nonlinear dynamical systems, such as weather, plasma, and
the economy, are ubiquitous in nature and everyday’s life, yet
such systems are typiﬁed by their highly complex and chaotic
behaviors, making them notoriously difﬁcult to study theo-
retically, experimentally, and numerically. Analytic solutions
of nonlinear systems are rare, experiments are often too in-
ﬂexible or impractical, and numerical simulations must take
into account a large number of data points in multiple dimen-
sions in order to accurately model a problem of interest, such
that even the fastest supercomputers today would take days or
weeks to simulate relatively simple nonlinear dynamics that
a physical system exhibits in seconds.

On the opposite side of the same coin, we can regard the
physical system as a computational device that computes its
own dynamics at a speed unimaginable by supercomputers.
The key to harnessing this tremendous computing power of a
physical system is therefore to make it compute other inter-
esting problems of the same order of complexity. Of course,
a conventional digital computer is itself a physical system,
but it makes use of complex semiconductor physics to com-
pute elementary logic operations, and in doing so, discards
a large amount of information that is considered extraneous.
In this perspective, a digital computer is an extremely inef-
ﬁcient computing device, as it only utilizes an exceedingly
small amount of the full computing capability potentially of-
fered by its physics. The advantage in this case is the ﬂexibil-
ity in cascading different logic operations for general-purpose
computing, but as evidenced by the difﬁculties in the numer-
ical simulations of nonlinear dynamical systems, this inefﬁ-
cient computing method is often inadequate.

In order to make full use of the computing capability of-
fered by a physical system, we hereby propose the concept
of metaphoric computing, which makes use of a more ex-
perimentally accessible nonlinear dynamical system to simu-
late another nonlinear dynamical system. An example of this
computing method is a wind tunnel, in which a small-scale
ﬂuid experiment is performed to simulate large-scale ﬂuid
dynamics, by virtue of the scaling laws inherent in ﬂuid dy-
namics. Metaphoric computing, however, is not restricted to
the use of similar physical systems to simulate each other.
In this paper, we show in particular that nonlinear optics

can compute ﬂuid dynamics as well. An optical beam in-
herently holds three-dimensional spatiotemporal information,
and nonlinear optical propagation computes the evolution of
this large amount of information simultaneously at the speed
of light, promising substantial parallelism and speed for com-
puting. Although the use of nonlinear optics for digital com-
puting has not been as successful as the use of solid-state elec-
tronics, forcing optical beams to compute binary logic wastes
most of the spatiotemporal information that can be manip-
ulated in optical beams. Instead of ﬁtting a square peg in a
round hole, using optics to simulate other nonlinear dynami-
cal systems provides a natural way of making full use of the
computing capacity offered by a nonlinear optical system.

Fluid dynamics, the foundation of a wide variety of im-
portant research ﬁelds including meteorology, aeronautics,
plasma physics, superﬂuids, and Bose-Einstein condensates,
is an ideal problem to solve by metaphoric computing. In-
tractable theoretical analysis and inﬂexible experiments com-
pel the use of numerical simulations, the difﬁculty of which
nonetheless gives rise to a whole new ﬁeld, computational
ﬂuid dynamics, in itself. The main difﬁculty is due to the in-
herent complexity of a ﬂuid dynamics problem, which is non-
linear and continuously generates ﬁner structures as the ﬂuid
dynamics evolves. For problems that are of practical inter-
est, such ﬁne structures are often orders-of-magnitude smaller
than the size of the objects under consideration, thus requir-
ing a large number of data points in each of the three spatial
dimensions to be manipulated at each time step, which must
also be correspondingly small to avoid numerical instabilities.
An alternative method of simulating complex ﬂuid dynamics
that combines the speed of a ﬂuid experiment and the ﬂexi-
bility of a numerical analysis is hence of great practical im-
portance. In this paper, we show that, via a suitable transfor-
mation, nonlinear optical propagation can be utilized to simu-
late Euler ﬂuid dynamics, which is known to be computation-
ally expensive and unstable to solve numerically . We also
provide strong evidence that nonlinear optics can simulate
high-Reynolds-number Navier-Stokes ﬂuid dynamics as well,
which include a large class of important and computationally
difﬁcult problems, such as turbulence. With the speed, paral-
lelism, and conﬁgurability of optics, an “optical wind tunnel”
may one day become a viable alternative to experiments and
numerical analysis in the study of ﬂuid dynamics.

B. Correspondence between nonlinear optics and ﬂuid dy-

namics

The analogy between nonlinear optics and ﬂuid dynamics has
been noted by many authors.1–18 Wagner et al. ﬁrst suggested
that the nonlinear propagation equation of an optical beam
can be recast into equations that resemble the continuity equa-
tion and the Bernoulli equation in irrotational ﬂuid dynam-
ics.1 Coullet et al. ﬁrst coined the term “optical vortices,”
which shows the analogy between phase singularities in op-
tics and ﬂuid vortices.2 Brambilla et al. noted that laser equa-
tions can be transformed to a hydrodynamic form.3 Arecchi
et al. ﬁrst experimentally demonstrated the dynamics of opti-
cal vortices in nonlinear optics.4 Akhmanov et al. called the
rich nonlinear dynamics observed in a nonlinear resonator
“optical turbulence.”5 Swartzlander and Law observed opti-
cal vortex solitons created via the instability of dark soliton
stripes analogous to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in ﬂuid
dynamics.6 Staliunas showed that a laser can be described
by the Ginzburg-Landau equation, which can be transformed
into equations resembling the Navier-Stokes equations that
describe viscous ﬂuid dynamics.7 Vaupel et al. observed vor-
tex pair nucleation by the interference of two modes in a laser
and claimed that it was an analog of a vortex street behind an
obstacle in a ﬂuid ﬂow.8 Molina-Terriza et al. also observed
optical vortex streets in walking second-harmonic genera-
tion.9 Roux10 and Rozas et al.11 studied the interactions be-
tween optical vortices and found that their interactions resem-
ble those of ﬂuid vortices. Rozas et al. then experimentally
demonstrated the ﬂuidlike motion of a pair of optical vor-
tices.12 Michinel et al.13 and Paz-Alonso et al.14 found that
optical propagation in a cubic-quintic nonlinear medium re-
sembles a liquid drop, and optical vortices in such a medium
also have ﬂuidlike motions.15 On the other hand, nonlinear
optics has been compared with superﬂuids and Bose-Einistein
condensates, as they can all be described, to varying de-
grees, by the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation,19, 20 commonly
known as the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the ﬁeld of super-
ﬂuids.21 Pomeau and Rica suggested that the phenomenon
of transition to dissipation in a superﬂow22 can be observed
in nonlinear diffraction.16 Bolda et al. numerically demon-
strated the same phenomenon in a nonlinear Fabry-P´erot cav-
ity.17 Chiao also found that photons in such a cavity should
obey the Bogoliubov dispersion relation for a superﬂuid.18

The abundant amount of prior work credited above pro-
vides ample evidence that nonlinear optics resembles ﬂuid
dynamics to a certain degree. In order to use nonlinear op-
tics as a useful and practical computational tool for ﬂuid
dynamics, however, simply drawing analogies between the
two kinds of dynamics is not enough. One must be able to
show an exact correspondence, or at the very least, an ap-
proaching convergence between a problem in nonlinear op-
tics and a problem in ﬂuid dynamics, in order to produce
any useful prediction of ﬂuid dynamics via nonlinear optics.
Moreover, as computers nowadays have enough capabilities
to simulate two-dimensional ﬂuids, the mere correspondence
between optics and two-dimensional ﬂuid dynamics consid-
ered in most of the prior work would not motivate the use of

2

metaphoric optical computing in preference to conventional
digital computing. A three-dimensional ﬂuid modeling, on
the other hand, requires a processing capability orders-of-
magnitude higher than that available in today’s supercomput-
ers, so metaphoric optical computing would need to compute
such problems much more efﬁciently to compete with elec-
tronic computers and the Moore’s law.

In the following sections, we shall attempt

to estab-
lish the correspondence between nonlinear optics and three-
dimensional ﬂuid dynamics. We shall show that,
taking
group-velocity dispersion into account, nonlinear optical dy-
namics approaches three-dimensional inviscid Euler ﬂuid dy-
namics in the highly nonlinear self-defocusing regime, where
the optical intensity represents the ﬂuid density, the optical
phase gradient represents the ﬂuid velocity, the nonlinear re-
fractive index perturbation represents pressure, the propaga-
tion distance represents time, and the temporal dimension of
the optical pulse represents the third dimension of the ﬂuid.
As Euler ﬂuid equations often exhibit high numerical instabil-
ities, this correspondence in itself should be useful in model-
ing high-Reynolds-number ﬂuid dynamics away from objects
and boundaries. In the convergence of nonlinear Schr¨odinger
equation towards the Euler equations, a “quantum pressure”
term arising from the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation plays
the role of a small parameter. As this quantum pressure term
plays analogous roles to viscosity in the Navier-Stokes equa-
tions, we argue that nonlinear optics should be able to ap-
proximate viscous Navier-Stokes ﬂuid dynamics as well, in
the regime where quantum pressure and viscosity both play
the role of small parameters in the respective equations. That
said, we do not pretend that we have established the equiva-
lence between nonlinear optics and Navier-Stokes dynamics,
as the similarity between quantum pressure and viscosity is
still an open problem.

On the practical side, in cases where ideal nonlinear op-
tics setup is not available, we suggest a split-step method that
pieces together different optical devices to approximate an
ideal nonlinear optics experiment. This method is very similar
to the method proposed to simulate quantum systems using a
quantum computer.23

It must be stressed that although we focus on simula-
tions of classical physical systems, future quantum com-
puters that simulate quantum systems23 would run into the
same problem of manipulating a large amount of multi-
information. In the case of quantum sys-
dimensional
tems, multi-dimensional quantum information, such as a
multi-particle multi-spatiotemporal-dimensional wavefunc-
tion, needs to be processed in parallel. Quantum comput-
ers can naturally parallelize the multi-particle aspect, but
there is no obvious way of parallelizing the manipulation
of multi-spatiotemporal-dimensional information via simple
binary quantum logic. Perhaps a quantum metaphoric com-
puting would then be necessary, where a more accessible
multi-dimensional quantum system is used to simulate an-
other quantum system.

2. Correspondence between nonlinear optics and Euler

ﬂuid dynamics

A. Madelung transformation

We now proceed to show mathematically how the self-
defocusing nonlinear optical propagation equation, including
the effect of group-velocity dispersion, can be transformed to
three-dimensional hydrodynamic equations. First, we show
how the optics equations, in the absence of optical vortices,
correspond to inviscid and irrotational ﬂuid equations. This
form of transformation is widely attributed to Madelung.24
We model the paraxial nonlinear propagation of an optical
beam, described by the envelope function y (z, x, y, T ), via the
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation,19, 20

ﬁcient, T is the time coordinate in the moving frame of the
pulse, and n2 is the nonlinear Kerr coefﬁcient. To use the time
coordinate as the third spatial dimension of a ﬂuid, anomalous
group-velocity dispersion, or b 2 < 0, is required. Dispersion
can then be regarded in equal footing as diffraction if a nor-
malized time coordinate is deﬁned as

One can already see that Eq. (7) has the exact same form
as the ﬂuid continuity equation, while Eq. (8) resembles the
Bernoulli equation,1 if one regards the intensity as the ﬂuid
density and the phase gradient as the ﬂuid velocity. The non-
linear refractive index term, k0n2I, would resemble the ﬂuid
pressure if n2 < 0, so self-defocusing is required. The last

term in Eq. (8) is a peculiar term that arises from optical
diffraction and dispersion, does not exist in classical ﬂuid dy-
namics, and is commonly called the “quantum pressure.”

In order to compare these equations with ﬂuid equations

more easily, we use the following normalized variables,

where W is the characteristic size, K is the characteristic
phase gradient, I0 is some characteristic optical intensity
of the propagation, and a is the so-called “healing” length,
which is the length scale at which the quantum pressure term
has the same order of magnitude as the nonlinear term on the
right hand side of Eq. (8), M is the Mach number, which
measures the relative strength of ﬂuid pressure compared
with convection, and R is another number that measures the
relative strength of ﬂuid convection compared with quantum
pressure. The normalized equations become

Equation (12) is exactly the same as the ﬂuid continuity equa-
tion, and in the limit of M /R
0, which is the highly self-
defocusing regime, Eq. (13) is the same as the hydrodynamic
equation of motion that describes inviscid and irrotational ﬂu-
ids. Equations (12) and (13) also admit sound wave solutions,
which describe travelling perturbations to the density and the
velocity. As long as the sound waves are weak, the depen-
dence of pressure on the density is not crucial, and the use of
self-defocusing Kerr nonlinearity is adequate. This restricts
the correspondence to slightly compressible barotropic ﬂuids.
In order to model slightly compressible ﬂuids, the opti-
cal beam needs to have a relatively constant intensity back-
ground. This can be achieved approximately near the cen-
ter of a very large beam, in a large multimode waveguide
as a container in two spatial dimensions, or in a cubic-
quintic nonlinear medium to provide a “surface tension” to
the beam.13–15, 25

In general, the ﬂuid velocity vector should contain an irrota-
tional component and a rotational component,

The dynamics of vorticity is arguably the cornerstone of hy-
drodynamics.21 The inviscid ﬂuid dynamics that includes the
rotational effect is governed by the Euler equation,

where P is the pressure. For incompressible ﬂuids, M << 1,

One can then see that the optical Bernoulli equation, Eq. (13),
misses the rotational component of the convective term. In
other words, the Madelung transformation is only able to de-
scribe the irrotational part of the ﬂuid motion, but not the
more important rotational part.

The inability of the Madelung transformation to describe
vorticity is due to the failure of the transformation near opti-
cal vortices, where Eq. (13) is ill-deﬁned. To understand this
problem, consider a rectilinear optical vortex in polar coordi-
nates and neglect the third ﬂuid dimension for now,

y = f (r) exp(imq ),

r =

x2 + y2,

q = tan−

where m is an integer and is called the topological charge of

which resembles the vorticity of an ideal point ﬂuid vortex.26
The motion of these vortices, however, cannot be described
by the Madelung transformed equations due to two problems:
k diverges when r
0, so the ﬂuid velocity u at the center of
a vortex is inﬁnite, and f (r) must approach rm in the limit of

To overcome these difﬁculties, it is necessary to consider
the motion of the optical vortices separate from the irrota-
tional optical ﬂow.

C. Optical vortex solitons and point vortices

In a relatively constant intensity background, optical vortices
exist as optical vortex solitons.6, 25, 27 The optical envelope
function y of a vortex soliton is given by Eq. (19), where
rm for r << a, and f (r) approaches a constant for
f (r)
r >> a, where a is the healing length and also the size of

→

the dark spot of a vortex soliton. In three dimensions, a vor-
tex soliton exists as a vortex ﬁlament. We shall hereafter con-
sider single-charged vortex solitons with m =
1 only, as they
have the lowest energy and are the most prevalent ones aris-
ing from an experimental situation. It is also more accurate to
approximate continuous vorticity with only discrete vortices
with the smallest topological charge.

±

Eq. (22) suggests that an optical vortex soliton resembles
an ideal point vortex in incompressible ﬂuids. Indeed, the mo-
tion of optical vortices in the highly self-defocusing limit can
be rigorously proven to behave in the same way as point ﬂuid
vortices.10, 11, 28–31 If one deﬁnes the position of each vortex
ﬁlament as x j, then the ﬂuid velocity at each point due to
the presence of the vortex ﬁlaments in the limit of high self-
defocusing is given by

in the leading order. These equations of vortex motion are
valid as long as the separations of the vortices are much larger
than a. For example, Fig. 1 plots the intensity, phase, and
phase gradient of two rectilinear optical vortex solitons with
the same charge, which should rotate around each other, and
those of two vortices with opposite charges, which should
drift in the same direction perpendicular to their separation.

phase gradient (right column) of two optical vortex solitons

their separation. The phase gradient near the centers of the
vortices is not plotted due to its divergence.

With the vortex ﬁlaments, one can deﬁne the equivalent

which can be used to approximate the continuous vorticity
of a ﬂuid, if the number of vortex ﬁlaments is large enough.
In this case, to include the vorticity effect in the nonlinear
optical dynamics, one can phenomenologically patch up the
irrotational equation of motion, Eq. (13),

(26)

This modiﬁcation of the equation of motion can be attributed
to the phenomenon of phase slippage,21, 32 well known in the
ﬁeld of superﬂuids. The use of discrete point vortex interac-
tions to calculate Euler ﬂuid dynamics is also a well-known
numerical method in computational ﬂuid dynamics.33 Hence,
to simulate Euler ﬂuid dynamics, one can approximate both
the rotational and irrotational components of the initial ﬂuid
velocity proﬁle by the optical phase and the phase singular-
ities in an optical beam, and the nonlinear self-defocusing
propagation of the beam would converge to incompressible
Euler ﬂuid dynamics in the strongly self-defocusing regime.
One can also borrow from the well-established numerical
techniques33 to determine how the distribution of optical vor-
tices sufﬁciently approximates the continuous vorticity in ﬂu-
ids.

D. The ﬂuid ﬂux representation

So far, we have shown that optical vortex solitons behave like
point vortices in ﬂuids when they are far away from each
other, and this behavior can be used to approximate Euler
ﬂuid dynamics. However, there is no guarantee that the vor-
tices would remain well separated in the course of the vor-
tex dynamics. If optical vortices behaved exactly like point
vortices, then their velocities would diverge when they are
close to each other. This velocity divergence is well known to
cause signiﬁcant numerical instability in the use of point vor-
tices for computational ﬂuid dynamics.33 Another problem is
that in three dimensions, the self-induced velocity of a curved
point vortex ﬁlament diverges logarithmically
ln(1/a) in
0.33 Since the optical intensity decreases to
the limit of a
zero near the center of an optical vortex, the quantum pres-
sure term, which determines the size of the vortex dark spot,
can no longer be ignored, and the optical vortex interactions
should differ markedly from point vortex interactions when
their separation is on the order of a.

→

∼

To investigate the optical vortex dynamics when they are
close to each other, the ﬂuid velocity is no longer an appropri-
ate quantity to study, because it diverges near a vortex center.
The density, on the other hand, approaches zero towards the
center. This motivates us to deﬁne an alternative ﬁnite quan-
tity by multiplying the velocity and the density,

J

which is the ﬂuid ﬂux, or the momentum density. Simple cal-
culations show that the ﬂux is indeed ﬁnite everywhere in

an optical beam, including the center of an optical vortex. In
terms of the ﬂux, the tensor dynamical equations now read34

except the quantum pressure term in Eq. (29). Hence, in the
ﬂux representation, we have successfully avoided the problem
of divergent quantities. Furthermore, Eq. (29), in contrast to
Eq. (13), includes the correct convective term.

The use of momentum density in the description of non-
linear optical dynamics is more natural and appropriate than
the use of velocity in the Madelung transformation, as the dy-
namics ultimately evolves according to the basic law of mo-
mentum conservation. As we shall show next, when compar-
ing the optical ﬂux to the ﬂuid ﬂux, the dynamics of optical
vortex solitons are much more similar to that of less singu-
lar ﬂuid vortices than point vortices, and the correspondence
between nonlinear optics and Euler ﬂuid dynamics is still jus-
tiﬁed when a is ﬁnite.

E. Optical vortex solitons and vortex blobs

In light of the ﬂuid ﬂux representation, one should therefore
compare the ﬂux of an optical vortex soliton to the ﬂux of
a ﬂuid vortex. In an incompressible ﬂuid, the density is con-
stant, so the ﬂux is proportional to the velocity, and the ﬂux at
the center of a point vortex has the same singular behavior as
the velocity. Near a vortex soliton, however, the ﬂux is ﬁnite.
Consider the example of a single-charged vortex soliton. The
ﬂux near the center is given by

Instead of comparing a vortex soliton to a point vortex, one
should hence compare the soliton to a vortex blob,33 which
has ﬁnite vorticity over a ﬁnite area. The vorticity of a vortex
blob ﬁlament is mathematically described by

so in an incompressible ﬂuid, the ﬂuid ﬂux of an optical vor-
tex soliton with size a is the same as that of a vortex blob
with size a. See Fig. 2 for a graphical illustration. The dy-

Schr¨odinger equation by Nore et al.36, 37 Using the nonlin-
ear Schr¨odinger equation, Nore et al. numerical demonstrated
the Euler ﬂuid dyanmics of a jet made of an array of counter-
rotating vortices, which exhibit sinuous and varicose instabil-
ities.36 In another study, Nore et al. also demonstrated three-
dimensional shear ﬂows and showed that numerically solving
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation is a viable alternative to Euler
and Navier-Stokes equations for the numerical study of shear
ﬂows.37 As nonlinear optical propagation is governed by non-
linear Schr¨odinger equation, The numerical experiments by
Nore et al. show that nonlinear optics should also be able to
compute Euler ﬂuid dynamics.

3. Similarities between nonlinear Schr¨odinger dynamics

and Navier-Stokes ﬂuid dynamics

In the previous sections, we have shown the correspondence
between self-defocusing optical propagation and inviscid Eu-
ler ﬂuid dynamics via a variety of methods, including the
Madelung transformation, the incorporation of vorticity ef-
fect due to the “phase slip” phenomenon, the ﬂuid ﬂux rep-
resentation, and the comparison between optical vortex soli-
tons and vortex blobs. Even though viscosity plays the role of
a small parameter in most interesting ﬂuid dynamics prob-
lems, its effects are of paramount importance near a “no-
slip” boundary and in the dissipation of eddies, in which
cases the viscous Navier-Stokes equations should be used.
In this section we shall present evidence that the nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equation exhibits many of the same behaviors
of viscous Navier-Stokes ﬂuid dynamics, and in each case,
quantum pressure plays an analogous role to viscosity.

sentation are given by

optical vortex along a line across the center, to illustrate the
similarities between the two in terms of the ﬂux.

namics of a vortex blob and that of a vortex soliton are also
extremely similar. For example, the rotation frequency W
of
two like-charged vortex blobs approaches a constant (cid:181) 1/a2
when their separation goes to zero. Numerical simulations of
the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation also show that the rota-
tion frequency of two like-charged vortex solitons approaches
a constant (cid:181) 1/a2 and does not diverge like two point vor-
tices.35 On the other hand, the self-induced velocity of a
curved vortex blob ﬁlament is given by33

where the last term in Eq. (38) is the viscosity term and R
is called the Reynolds number, which describes the relative
strength of convection compared to viscosity,

(36)

where b is the unit binomial vector of the ﬁlament and r c is
the radius of curvative. The self-induced velocity of an optical
vortex soliton ﬁlament is proven to be exactly the same.29
Hence, optical vortex solitons act as vortex blobs, and a large
number of solitons can simulate Euler ﬂuid dynamics, much
like the popular discrete vortex blob method in computational
ﬂuid dynamics.33

ear optics and Euler ﬂuid dynamics

where U is the characteristic velocity of the ﬂuid system, L is
the characteristic length, and n
is the kinematic viscosity of

quantum pressure term in Eq. (29) via a dimensional analy-
sis would suggest that an analogous optical Reynolds number
would be deﬁned as

R = KW,

(40)

The most telling evidence of the correspondence between
nonlinear optics and Euler ﬂuid dynamics is perhaps the
numerical ﬂuid dynamics simulations using the nonlinear

where, to recall, K is the characteristic optical phase gradi-
ent, and W is the characteristic size of the optical experiment
setup. The optical Reynolds number thus roughly measures

nections.44 The radiation of acoustic energy in both cases
must cause a damping of the high-spatial-frequency convec-
tion within the optical beam, and the effective Reynolds num-
ber is again estimated to be equal to the optical Reynolds
number.38, 39, 41

C. K´arm´an vortex street

The K´arm´an vortex street is a famous viscous ﬂuid phe-
nomenon, in which alternate ﬂuid vortices are emitted from
the back of an obstacle to the ﬂow of a viscous ﬂuid, when the
Reynolds number increases beyond a certain threshold.26, 45
Using the numerical vortex blob method, Chorin ﬁrst simu-
lated such a phenomenon for a cylinder obstacle and obtained
good agreement with experimental data.46 Since an optical
beam diffracting past a low refractive index region would also
emit optical vortices and the vortices interact like vortex blobs
in a self-defocusing medium, we performed a numerical ex-
periment of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation to investigate
if we would observe a similar phenomenon for nonlinear op-
tics.

the number of optical vortices. In other words, if the opti-
cal Reynolds number indeed corresponds to its ﬂuid counter-
part, then the quantization of the optical vortices would play
an analogous role to ﬂuid viscosity. This view seems to be
echoed by other researchers in the ﬁeld of superﬂuids,38–41
although we must stress that it is still an open problem as to
what extent the quantization effect resembles the viscous ef-
fect.41

A. Zero-ﬂux boundary conditions, boundary layers, and

boundary layer separation

In classical ﬂuid dynamics the “no-slip” boundary condition
is most commonly used, and restricts the total velocity and
hence the total ﬂux to be zero at the boundary. For ﬂuid ﬂow
above a surface, the velocity shear introduced must be bal-
anced by a viscous stress, resulting in a boundary layer that
connects the zero velocity at the boundary to the ﬂow veloc-
ity above the boundary in an asymptotic expansion.42 For the
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation, the boundary condition of an
impenetrable object can be speciﬁed by a very low refractive
index region, which restricts the optical intensity to be zero at
the surface43 due to total internal reﬂection. Even though the
tangential velocity can have a non-zero value at the surface,
both the normal and tangential components of the ﬂux must
be zero there. This can hence be viewed as a zero-ﬂux “no-
slip” boundary condition. An optical boundary layer analo-
gous to the viscous boundary layer in classical ﬂuid dynamics
is also formed.43 See Fig. 3 for a graphical illustration of the
similarities between a viscous boundary layer and an optical
boundary layer.

Fig. 3. Comparison between a viscous boundary layer and an
optical boundary layer.

For a viscous ﬂuid ﬂow past an obstacle, as the Reynolds
number increases, the boundary layer begins to separate and
vorticity is convected behind the obstacle. An analogy in the
dynamics of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation, in the form
of vortex nucleation on the boundary, is also predicted,22
and in the case of large objects, the instability of the optical
boundary layer also depends on the optical Reynolds num-
ber R deﬁned in Eq. (40),40 much like the viscous boundary
layer separation.

B. Dissipation of eddies

Another important effect of viscosity is the dissipation of
small-scale structures in turbulence. An analogous effect in
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation is the emission of sound
waves two vortices are close to each other35 and the gener-
ation of Kelvin waves in the process of vortex line recon-

Fig. 4. Setup of numerical experiment (not-to-scale).

The numerical setup is sketched in Fig. 4. A big opti-
cal beam is assumed to propagate at an angle to an ellip-
soid cylinder, with a refractive index much lower than the
surroundings to act as an impenetrable object, in a self-
defocusing medium. The length of the long axis of the el-
lipsoid cross section is assumed to be W , and the short axis is
assumed to be one-ﬁfth of W throughout the simulations. The
two-dimensional nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation is solved
using the Fourier split-step method,20 which implies a peri-
odic boundary condition for the optical beam. This should not
affect the qualitative behavior of the dynamics, if the optical
beam is much bigger than the object. In all of the simula-
tions, the Mach number M is ﬁxed at 0.4, while the optical
Reynolds number R is varied. Figure 5 plots the intensity of
the optical beam at a normalized propagation distance z = 10
for an optical Reynolds number R = KW = 12.8. Optical vor-
tex solitons are created on the top and bottom side of the low-
refractive-index region, and they interact in such a way that
resembles the phenomenon of twin vortices behind an obsta-
cle in a low-Reynolds-number viscous ﬂuid ﬂow.

Figures 8, 9, and 10 plot the intensity, ﬂux, and momentum
vorticity of the optical beam respectively, at a longer propaga-

essentially unchanged.

We now raise the Reynolds number to R = 25.6 and per-
form the numerical experiment again. As seen from Figs. 11,
12, and 13, the optical vortex solitons become smaller and
more abundant, but at z = 10 the phenomenon of twin vor-
tices behind an obstacle is again observed.

At z = 20, however, signiﬁcant instability in the twin vor-
tices develops, such that the spatial symmetry between the
upper plane and the lower plane is broken, and alternative
bunches of optical vortices begin to be emitted from the back
of the object. Figures 14, 15, and 16 plot the intensity, ﬂux
and vorticity at z = 20 respectively, which demonstrate a be-
havior strongly resembling the famous K´arm´an vortex street
phenomenon.

Due to computing power constraints, we are only able to
simulate low-Reynolds-number ﬂows, which we do not ex-
pect to quantitatively reproduce viscous ﬂuid dynamics. We

have to use an ellipsoid cylinder in the numerical experi-
ments, instead of the more conventional circular cylinder,
to artiﬁcially generate more optical vortices, and the Mach
number is a little too high for compressional waves not to
play a signiﬁcant role in the dynamics. With all that said, us-
ing the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation, we are still able to
qualitatively demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time to our knowledge,
two well-known viscous ﬂuid phenomena, namely, the forma-
tion of twin vortices behind an obstacle, and the symmetry-
breaking instability of the twin vortices that leads to the
K´arm´an vortex street when the Reynolds number is increased.
Compared with previous claims of observing the K´arm´an
vortex street in nonlinear optics numerically7 or experimen-
tally,8, 9 our numerical results demonstrate an unprecedented
level of correspondence between nonlinear optical dynamics
and the K´arm´an vortex street phenomenon, thanks to the pres-
ence of a much larger number of optical vortices in our simu-
lations.

D. Kolmogorov turbulence

The striking similarities between nonlinear optics and vis-
cous ﬂuid dynamics are not limited to low-Reynolds-number
two-dimensional problems. As the Reynolds number is fur-
ther increased to the order of a million, the viscous ﬂuid
ﬂow enters a turbulent regime. Since this regime is highly
chaotic, only statistical signatures can be reproduced in a tur-
bulent ﬂuid ﬂow. A well-known signature of turbulence is the

Kolmogorov energy spectrum,47 derived under the assump-
tion that a “steady state” is reached when the macroscopic-
scale ﬂuid ﬂow continuously generate ﬁner spatial structures
via convection and viscosity dissipates the smallest struc-
tures. As viscosity plays a signiﬁcant role in the Kolmogorov
turbulence spectrum, it is surprising to see that numerical
simulations of the three-dimensional nonlinear Schr¨odinger
equation also reproduce the Kolmogorov spectrum at high
Reynolds numbers, and the vorticity dynamics of the “su-
perﬂow” described by the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation re-
sembles that of the viscous ﬂow, in which vortex reconnection
events play a major role.38, 39

The dissipation of the smallest spatial structures in a su-
perﬂow is speculated to be the Kelvin waves produced by
the natural motion and reconnections of vortex ﬁlaments,41, 44
and the corresponding Reynolds number is again speculated
to be R = KW .41 Numerical and theoretical analyses of the
so-called “quantum turbulence” exhibited by the nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equation all reveal striking similarities between
quantum and classical ﬂuids, and it is argued that the study of
quantum turbulence could lead to a better understanding of
turbulence in normal ﬂuids.48

4. The split-step method

While a nonlinear optical system shows promise for com-
puting Euler and Navier-Stokes ﬂuid dynamics, it also poses
serious technical challenges. Ideally one would like to have
a conﬁgurable nonlinear material with low loss, anomalous
group-velocity dispersion, high defocusing nonlinearity, and
three-dimensional co-propagating boundaries. One may only
be able to ﬁnd separate materials or optical devices, each of
which performs only some of the functions. Moreover, par-
asitic effects such as loss, two-photon absorption, and high-
order dispersion can be detrimental to the accuracy. To com-
bine different devices and periodically compensate for para-
sitic effects, we hereby propose the “split-step” method, the
inspiration of which comes from the numerical Fourier “split-
step” method.20 Consider the general nonlinear Schr¨odinger
equation,

Each of the propagation effects can hence be applied sepa-
rately to an optical pulse, with a quadratic error term. A sym-
metrized version of the split-step method can further reduce

the error order,

(44)

The split-step method is not unlike the proof of a quan-
tum computer being able to simulate any quantum systems.23
Whereas it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd a quantum device that performs
the exact Hamiltonian of the quantum system of interest, it is
possible to approximate the Hamiltonian in small time slices.
Similarly, in a metaphoric optical computer, one can form a
unit cell of a “meta-material” by combining a slice of defo-
cusing material, a slice of material with anomalous group-
velocity dispersion, a slice of ultrafast phase modulator to
apply the three-dimensional boundary conditions, and a gain
medium to compensate for loss. The optical beam can loop
through the unit cell multiple times in a cavity, so that the
outcome will approximate the true solution as if we had an
ideal medium. See Fig. 17 for a graphical illustration of the
method.

The split-step method has the additional advantages that
each subsystem can be tunable and easily substituted with an-
other material or device, and the pulse evolution can be mon-
itored more easily. The magnitude of each effect can be tuned
by simply changing the propagation length in each device,
In exchange of conﬁgurability we have sacriﬁced some ac-
curacy due to discretization errors and instability. The com-
putation speed may also be reduced by a large but constant
fraction, as the pulse may spend most of its time on simply
propagating from one device to the next and not performing
the core computation by nonlinear propagation. The split-step
method, however, does not detract from the inherent paral-
lelism in the computation, as the transverse dimensions are
not discretized.

5. Conclusion

In conclusion, we have used a variety of theoretical and nu-
merical methods to show that self-defocusing optical propa-

gation has a converging correspondence with Euler ﬂuid dy-
namics and a striking similarity with Navier-Stokes ﬂuid dy-
namics. We have numerically shown that the interactions of
a large number of optical vortex solitons are able to simu-
late two well-known viscous ﬂuid phenomena. We have also
proposed the split-step method, a way of practically imple-
menting the metaphoric optical computer.

There are serious technical challenges if a metaphoric com-
puter is to become useful for computing ﬂuid dynamics, es-
pecially three-dimensional ﬂuid dynamics problems, as tech-
niques for the complete speciﬁcation and characterization of
the spatiotemporal optical ﬁeld are still in their infancy. The
speed, conﬁgurability, and parallelism of a metaphoric optical
simulator nonetheless promise vast advantages over conven-
tional numerical simulations.

Since photons are quantum objects, optical propagation
would also inherently compute the quantum dynamics of
bosons, and may therefore be used as a metaphoric simula-
tor of quantum ﬂuids, such as superﬂuids, superconductors,
and Bose-Einstein condensates. In this way the advantages of
a metaphoric computer and those of a quantum computer are
combined, and only then the classical and quantum comput-
ing capabilities offered by photons would truly be exhausted.
This extension of metaphoric optical computing will be a sub-
ject of future work.

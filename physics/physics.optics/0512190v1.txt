Abstract

The generation of watt-level cw narrow-linewidth sources at speciﬁc deep UV wave-
lengths corresponding to atomic cooling transitions usually employs external cavity-
enhanced second-harmonic generation (SHG) of moderate-power visible lasers in
birefringent materials. In this work, we investigate a novel approach to cw deep-UV
generation by employing the low-loss BBO in a monolithic walkoﬀ-compensating
structure [Zondy et al, J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 20 (2003) 1675] to simultaneously
enhance the eﬀective nonlinear coeﬃcient while minimizing the UV beam ellip-
ticity under tight focusing. As a preliminary step to cavity-enhanced operation,
and in order to apprehend the design diﬃculties stemming from the extremely
low acceptance angle of BBO, we investigate and analyze the single-pass perfor-
mance of a Lc = 8 mm monolithic walk-oﬀ compensating structure made of 2
optically-contacted BBO plates cut for type-I critically phase-matched SHG of a
cw λ = 570.4nm dye laser. As compared with a bulk crystal of identical length, a
sharp UV eﬃciency enhancement factor of 1.65 has been evidenced with the tandem
structure, but at
1nm from the targeted fundamental wavelength, highlighting
the sensitivity of this technique when applied to a highly birefringent material such
as BBO. Solutions to angle cut residual errors are identiﬁed so as to match ac-
curately more complex periodic-tandem structure performance to any target UV
wavelength, opening the prospect for high-power, good beam quality deep UV cw
laser sources for atom cooling and trapping.

1 Introduction

∼

The generation of watt-level range deep UV (λ
350 nm) cw coherent radi-
ation from second-harmonic generation (SHG) has been until now hampered
by the lack of suﬃciently transparent or phase-matchable nonlinear materials
in the deep UV spectral range. Typically several hundreds milliwatt of deep
UV radiation are required for the laser cooling and trapping of atomic opti-
cal clock species such as H, Mg, Hg, Be or Ag [1], due to the large saturation
intensities of their cooling transition line. For instance, given the saturation in-
tensities of the 2S1/2-2P3/2 transition in Ag (λ = 328.1 nm, Isat = 87 mW/cm2),
decelerating a thermal beam by use of a Zeeman slower and realizing a 3D
magneto-optical trap (MOT) with suﬃciently high atomic densities would re-
quire
300 mW of UV power. In the ﬁrst cooling and trapping attempt with
Ag, only 40mW of UV radiation were available from the SHG of a red dye
laser with LBO, impeding hence their capture from a thermal atomic beam
105) loaded
and resulting in a low number of trapped atoms (Nat = 3
from background pressure [2]. Increasing the number of trapped atoms would
improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the Hz-level linewidth 2S1/2-2D5/2 two-
photon clock transition in Ag, that has been recently observed in a thermal
beam Doppler-free two-photon spectroscopy experiment [3]. A large number
of trapped atoms also increases the intrinsic stability of optical clocks based
on neutral atoms. For Mg and Be atoms, the saturation intensities of the 1S0-
1P1 cooling transition (λ = 285.2 nm for Mg and λ = 234.9 nm for Be) is
even higher (Isat = 455 mW/cm2 for Mg and Isat = 1097 mW/cm2 for Be) [4].
For the Mg clock experiment running in Hannover, only 100 mW of UV is
presently available from the external cavity-enhanced SHG of a dye laser us-
ing a bulk BBO crystal. The large walkoﬀ angle of BBO (ρ = 4.8◦ at 285nm)
combined with tight focusing further restricts the crystal length to 5-7 mm
and results in highly elliptical e-wave SH beam shape. Such a power limitation
prevents from loading a dense MOT from a Zeeman-slowed thermal atomic
beam [5].

×

To increase the interaction length and cancel the walkoﬀ eﬀect, an alterna-
tive to birefringent oxo-borate crystals may be to use nowadays available
periodically-poled ferroelectric materials that employ quasi-phase-matching
(QPM), i.e. periodic domain polarity reversal every micrometer-scale coher-
ence length lcoh = π/∆k [6,7,8]. Among them, pp-LiTaO3 possesses the largest
UV band gap (λg = 280 nm) but the broad UV absorption band (due to in-
trinsic lattice defects or transition metal ions impurities [9]) extending from
400 nm limits their use to single-pass interactions. With
the band edge to
2 cm−1 (as

cause severe thermal lensing eﬀects and photo-refraction within any external
enhancement resonator, as it was reported at an even longer blue wavelength
(473 nm) for pp-KTP for instance [11], although thermal lensing was subse-
quently minimized by using looser cavity waists [12]. Furthermore, for short

QPM is a challenging issue [13]. Using a second-order QPM at Λ = 2.65µm for
the single-pass generation of λ = 325 nm in pp-LiTaO3, Meyen et al measured
a reduced eﬀective nonlinear coeﬃcient of only deﬀ = 2.6 pm/V due to the
combined eﬀect of UV absorption and grating pitch imperfections [13].

Hence due to the lack of low-loss periodically poled materials for the UV range,
generating watt-level cw light in the deep UV using birefringent material is
a formidable task, except at speciﬁc wavelengths such as 266nm for which
powerful (up to 15W cw) green frequency-doubled Nd:YVO4 single-frequency
lasers are readily available [14]. Among the few deep UV transmitting materi-
als (KDP, ADP, LBO, CLBO, BBO) [10], BBO remains the best compromise
owing to its larger UV bandgap (λg = 280 nm), high UV damage threshold
1 GW/cm2) and its larger nonlinearity (deﬀ ≤

2 pm/V, i.e.

that of KDP). Although the recently in-
∼
troduced bismuth triborate material (BiB3O6 or BIBO [15]) with twice larger
nonlinearity and lower walkoﬀ than BBO cannot be used for the generation
of deep UV below
350 nm, because of its limited useful transmission range
for cw applications necessitating thick samples of the order of 1 cm. The ad-
vantage of using larger nonlinearity crystals in resonator-enhanced SHG stems
from the lesser sensitivity of the parametric conversion yield to impedance-
matching conditions, when the round-trip nonlinear loss ΓPc (where Γ – see
Eq. (1) – is the nonlinear eﬃciency in unit of W−1 and Pc is the circulating
fundamental power) exceeds by far the linear passive fractional loss LRT, a
condition easily realized with periodically-poled crystal owing to their large
LRT), the
d33 nonlinear coeﬃcients [12]. Under the latter condition (ΓPc ≫
LRT), and
optimal input coupler transmissivity Topt increases indeed (Topt ≫
the overall eﬃciency becomes insensitive to the lumped passive resonator loss.
The drawback of BBO is however its ten-fold smaller eﬀective nonlinear co-
eﬃcient deﬀ and the large walk-oﬀ angle (ρ
80 mrad) of the deep UV SH
beam, limiting hence the focused-beam interaction length to a few millimeters.
Furthermore, this huge walk-oﬀ combined with type-I strong focusing results
in highly elliptical UV beam shape that needs to be spatially ﬁltered for use
in a 3D MOT, at the expense of detrimental power loss.

It is well known that walkoﬀ compensation increases the coherence length
of critical birefringence phase-matching. Producing powerful cw laser sources
with good beam quality in the deep UV spectral range with BBO can be de-
vised by taking proﬁt of the single-pass eﬃciency enhancement of the mono-

3

lithic (optically-contacted) walkoﬀ-compensation technique labelled as 2N-
OCWOC structure [16]. 2N-OCWOC structures are periodic devices of length
Lc = 2Nlc, consisting of 2N (N = 1, 2, ... is the pairing number) crystal plates
of thickness lc rigidly stacked by optical adherence (and eventually diﬀusion-
bonded, 2N-DBWOC) in the walk-oﬀ compensating conﬁguration. Compared
with the standard walkoﬀ-compensation technique employing independently
rotated multiple crystals (see, e.g., Refs. [17,18,19]), the compactness of mono-
lithic 2N-OCWOC or 2N-DBWOC devices allows an improved crystal struc-
ture conﬁnement within the near-ﬁeld range of a tightly focused beam, elim-
inating the need for inter-plate facets anti-reﬂection (AR) coating (only the
outer structure facets need eventually to be AR-coated). The detailed princi-
ple of operation of these structures has been thoroughly analyzed in Ref. [16],
and their fabrication will be further outlined in Section 2. The principle of
operation of 2N-OCWOC periodic structures is fundamentally diﬀerent from
the QPM technique, in the sense that each plate of the stack is birefringently
phase-matched (hence the plate thickness can be arbitrarily chosen, but should
approximately match the walkoﬀ aperture length la = √πw0/ρ for an eﬃcient
walkoﬀ compensation). Consequently 2N-OCWOC structures are conditioned
to the pre-requite occurrence of birefringence phase-matching, unlike the `a la
carte phase-matching tailoring capability of QPM structures. A second diﬀer-
ence with QPM crystals is that the relative sign of the nonlinear coeﬃcient
deﬀ from plate to plate must remain unchanged in order to avoid backconver-
sion of the parametric process, whereas in QPM crystals this sign is reversed
every coherence length lcoh so as to provide constructive interference along the
periodic structure. This constraint on how to keep the same relative sign of
deﬀ in walkoﬀ-compensating schemes is not trivial and has been previously
extensively devised [17,18,19]. Another limitation of 2N-OCWOC structures
stemming from the frozen relative orientation of the adhered plates is that
they work eﬃciently only near normal-incidence phase-matching (PM) and
require thus an accurate match of the cut angle θcut of all plates to the phase-
matching angle θPM of the target fundamental wavelength. Hence extensive
angular tuning is precluded contrary to bulk birefringent crystals, because at
incidence angles exceeding the angular tuning bandwidth of each plate, one
plate over two will not be phase-matched because of the crossed relative optic
axis direction stemming from walkoﬀ compensation [16]. Hence only temper-
ature tuning at ﬁxed normal incidence via the thermo-optic properties of the
material is possible for moderate wavelength tuning. This angular tunability
restriction renders the fabrication of 2N-OCWOC devices extremely challeng-
ing for large birefringence materials as BBO because of its narrow angular
acceptance bandwidth (∆θ
L
cm) as compared with KTP. Due to

the unavoidable angle cut uncertainty (typically ∆θcut ≃ ±

preliminary stringent tests aimed at determining the PM angle to a precision
equivalent to the acceptance angle ∆θ of each plate. Finally, small relative

2N-OCWOC structures have been until now successfully implemented in type-
II critically phase-matched SHG of 1064 nm laser with a KTiOPO4 (KTP)
10-plate structure, leading to a record single-pass enhancement factor of up
compared with a bulk KTP for SHG at 1064 nm [20]. A 4-plate

KTP structure (N = 2) was also used for enhanced frequency-doubling of
2.53 µm color center laser [21], and a 2-OCWOC RbTiOAsO4 (RTA) tandem

has led to a 3.7
In this latter experiment, walkoﬀ-compensation also allowed to perform cas-
caded third-harmonic generation into the blue by sum-frequency generation
of the residual spatially recombined 1.32 µm o and e waves with the generated
red o-wave exiting the tandem structure in the sum-mixing crystal. Although
for type-I coupling, only a moderate enhancement as compared with type-II
is predicted [16] (in type-I coupling, the oo or ee polarization wave radiates
along the whole crystal length while in type-II it ceases to radiate as soon as
the two o and e components walk oﬀ), the advantage of a UV beam shape
re-circularization thanks to walkoﬀ compensation cannot be neglected [16].

∼

In this work, we investigate for the ﬁrst time the fabrication of deep UV mono-
lithic walk-oﬀ compensating structures with type-I (ooe) birefringence phase-
matched BBO. Due to the large birefringence of BBO (∆n
0.12 and related
vanishing angular acceptance bandwidth), we have chosen as a starting step
to characterize ﬁrst a 2-OCWOC device with length Lc = 8 mm (N = 1, i.e. 2
contacted plates with lc = 4mm) prior to the design of a more complex struc-
ture employing up to 10 (N = 5) optically-contacted plates. The 2-OCWOC
tandem actually constitutes the basic unit cell of 2N-OCWOC periodic struc-
tures (section 2). This preliminary step allows further to test the feasibility
and quality of optical adherence with BBO, and to highlight the main im-
portant parameters for the design of a more complex tandem structure. As
compared with type-I non-monolithic BBO walkoﬀ-compensating devices, for
which the relative orientation of the plates can be independently controlled so
as to broaden the overall phase-matching bandwidth [18,19], we shall conﬁrm
the prediction of the 2N-OCWOC cw theory [16] as to the limited and ﬁnite
acceptance bandwidth characterizing a frozen-orientation OCWOC tandem
(section 3). We also demonstrate that at the optimal design wavelength corre-
sponding to normal-incidence phase-matching, a nearly two-fold enhancement
(with respect to a bulk BBO sample of identical length) of the SH conversion
eﬃciency of the 2-OCWOC tandem is obtained, as predicted by the theory
(section 5). Additionally, we provide an accurate measurement of the type-I
BBO eﬀective nonlinearity for UV generation, in agreement with recent mea-
surements. We ﬁnally conclude from these preliminary investigations on the
relevant procedures to design even more eﬃcient complex structures with an

5

arbitrary number of plates, so as to circumvent the stringent accuracy lim-
itations imposed by the large medium birefringence (section 6). The chosen
1 P1 Doppler
target UV wavelength (λ = 285.217 nm) corresponds to the 1S0 −
cooling transition of Mg, but could be any wavelength above the λg ∼
180 nm
UV transmission cut-oﬀ of BBO. The walkoﬀ angle experienced by the extraor-
dinary SH wave is ρ = 4.8◦ = 84 mrad at 285 nm, yielding a short cylindrical
beam aperture length of la = √πw0/ρ = 21w0. For a typical fundamental waist
50 µm, the bulk aperture length is about la = 1mm. Let us note that in
w0 ∼
focused beam geometry and using a bulk BBO, the typical maximum length
30µm is
that optimizes the conversion eﬃciency for a waist in the range 20
about Lc = 5
7mm. Beyond this length, the dephasing of the walking-oﬀ
SH e-wave with respect to the fundamental o-wave polarization results in ex-
tremely sharp ellipticity of the SH beam. The use of a 2N-OCWOC structure
with N > 1 would allow to increase this interaction length while minimizing
the UV beam ellipticity and releasing the vanishing-bandwidth constraint.

2 2-OCWOC tandem principle and fabrication

If two identically cut crystals are cascaded such that their optical axes (c)
are crossed with respect to a plane perpendicular to the light propagation
z-axis, the internal Poynting vector Se of the walking-oﬀ wave in the second
crystal is reversed (symmetry with respect to z) with respect to its direc-
tion in the ﬁrst crystal. Hence walkoﬀ compensation in birefringent media
takes proﬁt of the principle of the inverse return of light upon a mirror-like
folding process (Fig. 1). From the point of view of harmonic generation, the
two cascaded crystals are equivalent to a double-passed single crystal using
a back-reﬂecting mirror (or a multi-pass SHG in a semi-monolithic concave-
plano resonator [23]), provided that the phase-shift of the waves due to mirror
reﬂection does not reverse the sign of the nonlinear coeﬃcient.

≡

The design of a unit-cell 2-OCWOC tandem may start from an oriented bulk
sample of length Lc (θ
θPM in Fig. 1 being the PM angle between the
optic axis and the normal to the facets) that is sliced into 2 plates of identical
length lc = Lc/2. The second plate is then rotated by 180◦ along an axis either
perpendicular or parallel to the propagation axis, so as to reverse the relative
sign of walkoﬀ (+ρ
ρ) from one plate to the other (Fig.1). The choice
of the rotation axis, which depends on the polarization conﬁguration of the
interacting waves, is dictated by the conservation of the relative sign of the

nonlinear coeﬃcient (+deﬀ →
in order to avoid back-conversion of the SH wave. In the case of type-I(ooe)
coupling, the rotation axis is perpendicular to the propagation axis. The length

The 2-OCWOC plates of length lc = 4 mm (aperture 4
diced from a single bulk BBO element oriented at θ = 43.2◦ (ϕ = 30◦), with
0.2◦. The chosen plate length lc = 4 mm corresponds
an accuracy of
to one aperture length la for a waist value w0 = 188 µm. Let us note that
the predicted BBO phase-matching angle determined from various Sellmeier
1◦ from the chosen orientation. Due
equations [10] may diﬀer by more than
to the extremely small acceptance bandwidth of BBO, it is expected that nor-
mal incidence phase-matching would not exactly match the target wavelength
(hence a tunable laser such as the dye laser used for pumping is necessary
to characterize the 2-OCWOC structure). Care was taken so that the saw-
ing process and subsequent ﬁne plate polishing required for optical adherence
did not aﬀect the relative orientation of the resulting plates, which would be
detrimental to the conversion eﬃciency due to the vanishing acceptance angle
bandwidth of the phase-matching. The contacted plate facets have the follow-
ing speciﬁcations: ﬂatness not less than λ/8, parallelism not larger than 20
arc seconds, surface ﬁnish better than 10/5 scratch/dig. After careful hand-
polishing, the two plates were then brought into optical adherence to form the
2-OCWOC tandem. The two outer structure facets were left uncoated for this
preliminary testing. Let us note that despite all these precautions, the sawing
and polishing processes may introduce residual slight relative orientation cut
from one plate to the other, the eﬀect of which has been found to broaden the
phase-matching bandwidth at the expense of the enhancement factor brought
about by the walkoﬀ compensation eﬀect [16,20]. Such eﬀects are minimal
when the relative orientation mismatch angle is small enough compared to
the acceptance angle of a single plate (∆θ

0.04◦).

∼

An available uncoated BBO witness bulk sample with identical length Lc =
8 mm as the 2-OCWOC tandem was used for conversion eﬃciency compar-
ison purpose. For this bulk sample, the orientation accuracy did not matter
since slight angular tuning allows to phase-match any wavelength around the
targeted one. The quality of the optical contact of the 2-OCWOC tandem was
checked by comparing its transmission spectrum with that of the bulk witness
sample. No signiﬁcant diﬀerence of transmittance was noted. We have used
further the focused yellow laser, which allowed to scan the focused spot over
the 2-OCWOC aperture, for direct transmission comparison. Both methods
gave identical transmission factor for the two samples, indicating that good
optical contact was obtained over more than 80% of the total aperture. The
absence of spurious Fresnel reﬂection other than the specular reﬂection from
the input facet was another indication of the quality of the adhered surfaces.

As pointed out in the introductory section, the limited angular tunability
imposed by the frozen relative orientation of the plates is explained in Fig.1
which sketches the case of a fundamental o-wavevector ko(ω) (out of the bundle
of wavevectors of the Gaussian beam) impinging either at i = 0◦ (upper frame)
or at an oblique incidence i

relative θ = θPM orientation mismatch exists between the 2 plates. The e-
wave Poynting vectors Se of the SH generated by two symmetrically located

For i = 0◦ both SH rays overlap and interfere at M2 with a phaseshift dictated

diﬀraction pattern at their wings. The ellipticity of the 2-OCWOC beam pro-
ﬁle is seen to be slightly reduced as compared with that of the bulk crystal.
Clearly, for Lc = 8 mm the number of twinned plates must be increased for a
substantial improvement in beam shape quality (see section 6).

4 Experimental setup and measurement procedures

The experimental setup is sketched in Fig.4. The frequency-stabilized, single-
longitudial mode rhodamine 6G dye laser is widely tunable around the target
fundamental wavelength of λ = 2λUV = 570.434 nm, by tuning the intra-cavity
Lyot ﬁlter. Typically, the laser delivers a power of 1.7 W with a linewidth of 1.3
MHz and nearly perfect Gaussian beam shape. The wavelength is measured by

The yellow beam power can be attenuated by a half-wave plate followed by a
polarisation beam splitter. A second half-wave plate permits the optimisation
of the ﬁnal ”ordinary” (vertical) polarisation for the fundamental wave. For
convenient UV power detection on an oscilloscope, the laser beam is chopped
at about 200 Hz and focused into the BBO samples (2-OCWOC tandem or
bulk witness BBO) with a set of lenses (focal lengths f = 80
500 mm). The
crystal is mounted on a rotation stage with a resolution of 0.016 degree for
angular bandwidth measurements. The rotation stage is attached to a xyz-
positioner for optimization of the focusing conditions. Care was taken not
to clamp the 2-OCWOC tandem in order to avoid mechanical stress that
may disrupt the optical contact. A 2 mm thick Schott glass ﬁlter (UG11)
located behind the crystal transmits 64 % of the UV light and completely
blocks the fundamental power (T < 10−10). To avoid thermal damage of the
absorptive glass ﬁlter due to the tight focusing, the fundamental power has
to be limited to about 400 mW. The UV light is focused by a f = 50 mm
collecting fused-silica lens on the small area (1.1 mm2) Si photodiode with
a calibrated responsivity of r=0.113 A/W at 285.2 nm. The photocurrent is
converted into voltage with a transimpedance ampliﬁer based on a low noise,
low oﬀset voltage and large gain-bandwidth product operational ampliﬁer chip
(OPA627) with a 10 MΩ load resistor. The voltage-to-power conversion is
1.13 mV/nW. Since the voltage noise, given by the oscilloscope trace thickness,
was about 5 mV it was possible to detect down to a few nW UV of light. All
SH powers P2ω reported hereafter correspond to a ﬁxed fundamental power of
Pω = 400mW, so that every displayed conversion eﬃciency curve gives the net
absolute UV generated power for a constant reference power (Pω = 0.4 W),
after correction for the transmissivity losses of the uncoated crystal facets
(nω = n2ω = 1.67 at λ = 570.4 nm) and glass ﬁlter. The UV generated power
did not vary more than 10% when the laser focus is scanned over 80% of the
samples aperture, the ﬂuctuations being due to some sparse scattering points
in the BBO samples. Let us recall that the fundamental transmission loss of

12

the bulk and 2-OCWOC samples were found identical.

Fig.5(a) shows the results for a loose (w0 = 95µm) and for a near optimal
strong focusing conditions (w0 = 25µm). Indeed, a sharp enhancement peak
lying over a broad pedestal spanning over
6 nm for the strongest focusing –
as predicted in Fig.2 in terms of Φ variable – is apparent but at ∆λ0 ≃ −
1nm
(λ0 = 569.525 nm) from our target wavelength (λ = 570.434 nm). This unfor-
tunate discrepancy originates from the insuﬃcient accuracy in matching the
BBO cut angle (θcut) to the actual PM angle (θPM), as previously discussed,
given the unavoidable inaccuracy of dispersion relations and crystal orienta-
0.2nm is in agreement with
tion. The experimental peak width ∆λFWHM ≃
the theoretical peak width expressed in Φ unit in Fig.2, and compares also
surprisingly well with the plane-wave spectral bandwidth of the bulk equiva-
lent crystal, ∆λPW = 0.15nm. The intensity and width of the broad pedestal
match approximately those of the wavelength tuning curve of the bulk wit-

strong focusing can be noticed, as in the angular tuning curves taken at a

When the laser wavelength was tuned to
hancement in conversion eﬃciency vanishes despite additional angular tuning
[Fig.5(d)], and the maximum UV power is then identical to or slightly lower
than that obtained with the bulk sample. This demonstrates that away from
λ0 the contribution of both plates are independent (no interference eﬀect). Ac-
tually, the UV proﬁles captured at zobs = 20 cm by a CCD camera for λ = λ0

proﬁle is a single elliptical spot in the ﬁrst case, whereas two adjacent ellipses
appear for the second case as a proof that the UV Poynting vectors do not
overlap for this slightly oblique incidence PM. In the angular tuning curve of
Fig.5(d), the strong diﬀraction hinders the observation of two separate max-
ima, but the non normal incidence eﬀect described in Fig.(1) manifests in the
far-ﬁeld proﬁle of the SH wave. Let us mention that contrary to the 2-OCWOC
tandem, the tuning curve shapes (angular or wavelength) and UV intensity of
the witness bulk crystal were wavelength insensitive.

respective to the non walk-oﬀ compensated crystal. The measured enhance-
ment value is close to the one predicted in Fig.(2), i.e. h1/h0 = 1.96. This en-
hancement due to walkoﬀ-compensation is equivalent to an enhancement of the
bulk eﬀective nonlinearity, deﬀ(N = 1)/deﬀ(N = 0), by a factor √1.65 = 1.28.
Because our absolute power measurements are accurate to
5%, we were able
to check the nonlinear coeﬃcient value of BBO in the UV range. From the

nonlinear coeﬃcient of BBO at 285 nm, deﬀ(285 nm) = 1.75 pm/V. This value
is very close to the value assumed in the caption of Fig.2, and also identical
to the value reported for the SHG at 266nm in Ref. [14]. The related uncer-
tainty should not exceed
10% despite the fact that we have neglected the
0.05 cm−1 [10,26,27]). Since for type-I(ooe),

of both tandem plates, several angular tuning curves of the 2-OCWOC device
were recorded at various wavelengths located around λ0, under a loose (quasi
plane-wave) focusing condition allowing to screen oﬀ the broadening eﬀect of
strong diﬀraction. According to the simple ray picture of Fig.1 describing the
behavior of the 2-OCWOC tandem under slightly oblique incidence phase-
matching (hence away from λ0), shining the tandem under cylindrical plane-
wave condition (i.e. when beam divergence δ0 = λ/πnωw0 is small compared
to the plate PM acceptance angle ∆θ) should result in the appearance of two
PM peaks in the angular tuning behavior. The measurement of their angular
position respective to normal incidence provides an accurate knowledge on the
absolute cut angles of both plates, and also provides a mean to better match
the design wavelength to the target wavelength, as we shall see further.

λ0 = 569.525 nm.

Fig.6 displays the angular tuning patterns for several pump wavelengths around
λ0. Away from λ0, the curves display indeed a well separate dual-peak feature,
evidencing that the contributions from the 2 plates do not interfere due to the
much reduced acceptance angle and to the non strictly normal incidence phase-
matching. Under strong focusing, the broadening eﬀect due to diﬀraction and
walkoﬀ washes out the 2-peak features as can be seen for the λ = 571.367 nm
angular tuning curve at w0 = 20 µm (Fig.5(d)). The non-interfering feature
is then evidenced by the appearance of two elliptical lobes in the far-ﬁeld
transverse pattern.

As the wavelength approaches λ0, the two peaks tend to merge into a single
enhanced peak centered at i = 0◦, the amplitude of which is 4
greater. Note
that the corresponding wavelength on the plot (λ = 569.480 nm) does not ex-
actly match λ0, even though it lies within the ∆λFWHM = 0.2 nm enhancement
bandwidth. The symmetric angular locations of the two peaks – with respect
to normal incidence – in each of the curves is an indication that no relative ori-

within the technical fabrication inaccuracy – highlights the diﬃculties in the
design of 2N-OCWOC out of BBO. The sign (
) of the angle correction to
be performed to the present value of θcut can be ascertained from the known
linear dispersion of θPM(λ) in BBO. Since dθPM/dλ < 0, the (

to shift the design wavelength from λ0 = 569.525 nm to λ = 570.434 nm. This
would imply to de-assemble the tandem and to wedge-polish both plates and
check the wedge correction angle by use of optical or interferometric techniques

Another alternative to match the target wavelength to the design wavelength is
to set the tandem at i = 0◦ and employ temperature tuning to move the room
temperature design wavelength to the target wavelength located by less than
1nm above. Such a temperature matching was recently used to demonstrate
solitonic beam self-trapping in a 10-OCWOC KTP structure type-II phase-
matched for the SHG of a pulsed 1064nm laser [30]. BBO has rather small
birefringe in its ordinary and extraordinary thermo-optic coeﬃcients [29]. The
evaluation of the thermo-optic dispersion of PM angles at 570.5 nm SHG yields
0.1◦,
dθPM/dT
100◦C. Because in our
one needs hence to heat or to cool the sample by ∆T
case, negative ∆θPM < 0 correction is required, one has then to cool down the
tandem to a cryogenic temperature, which is ruled out by technical constraints.
If the correction sign to angle cut were positive, instead of being negative, a
90◦C would have been possible. However,
more convenient heating up to T
the anisotropic thermal expansion behavior of BBO (which has opposite signs
of expansion in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the optic axis)
must be taken into account to avoid disrupting the optical contact during
the heating ramp phase. We plan to investigate in the future this thermal
behavior of optical adherence in BBO 2N-OCWOC structures. To rule out
the eventuality of contact breaks, the use of more rigid thermally diﬀusion-
bonded structures (2N-DBWOC) can be envisaged as with KTP [31].

6 Considerations for the design of an 8-OCWOC BBO structure

The above experimental analysis of the spectral and angular behaviors of the
2-OCWOC tandem highlights the extreme diﬃculties related to the optimal
design of 2N-OCWOC structures out of the highly birefringent BBO, but also
provides useful informations on the design criteria for a successful monolithic
walkoﬀ-compensating structure for the deep UV. A preliminary step is to

16

match the θcut angle as accurately as possible with the target wavelength
θPM(λ0), by using a preliminary bulk test sample. The accuracy of this match
must be of the order of the phase-matching acceptance angle of each plate
(∆θ

0.04◦ for lc = 4mm).

∼

∼

0.15◦,
Decreasing lc down to 1mm will relax this matching tolerance to ∆θ
a value close to the X-ray diﬀractometer uncertainty. From the present exper-
iment, the orientation error sign should be preferably negative in order to use
heat tuning for correction. In our case, keeping the structure length constant,
the next step is then to increase the pairing number to, e.g. N = 4 (lc = 1mm)
or N = 5 (lc = 0.8mm), since walk-oﬀ is far from being totally compensated
with N = 1. The optimal plate length should correspond to the aperture
length la = √πw0/ρ which, for w0 = 25µm, is 0.5mm. The limiting factor for
the pairing number N will be related to the technical handling and polishing
of very thin plates. Note however that the overall acceptance bandwidth of the
structure will not be broadened to that of a single plate as in non-monolithic
walkoﬀ-compensated devices [19] for which the rotational adjustment of each
individual plate is allowed for phase compensation. In monolithic 2N-OCWOC
devices, the overall bandwidth will depend on the freezed relative orientation
mismatches among the plates, as pointed out in Ref. [16]. From the theory
given in Ref. [16], the acceptance bandwidth cannot diverge as N
, but
remains ﬁnite and equal to twice the acceptance bandwidth of the equivalent
bulk sample.

a bulk crystal (dashed line) is expected on the main central lobe. Note that
signiﬁcant transmission also exists for 4 adjacent wavelengths, owing to the
ideal ﬁlter response of the structure. Actually – and hopefully – small residual
random ﬂuctuations δθcut(j) of plate orientation mismatches washing out the
wavevector mismatch grating of the ideal structure will eﬀectively broaden the
central lobe [16] to a few times the bandwidth of the bulk equivalent crystal,
as already observed with a 10-OCWOC KTP structure [20]. Depending on
how far the structure departs from the ideal case, the peaks will be more or
less washed out to yield a broad transmission pattern. In the limiting case
of large ﬂuctuations [16], the bandwidth of the 2N-OCWOC structure may
broaden up to that of the individual thin plate. This broadening is however
paid back by a reduction of the peak eﬃciency enhancement.

Finally, we plot in Fig.8 the expected gain in UV beam shape quality, as
compared with the simple 2-plate tandem. One notices that the ﬁne oscillatory
structure at the wings of the 2-plate tandem has disappeared. Although the
proﬁle re-symmetrization is not complete, the UV beam shape ellipticity is
drastically reduced, allowing standard beam shaping optics to perform the
ﬁnal re-circularization.

7 Conclusions

In summary, we have performed preliminary investigations of the feasibility
of monolithic BBO walk-oﬀ compensating structures for deep UV generation.

18

The preliminary results obtained with a tandem of 2 crystals pledge for the
increase of the number of plates with millimeter to sub-millimeter thickness.
An increased number of thinner plates should circumvent the accuracy limi-
tations of the fabrication process, increase further the eﬃciency enhancement
and reduce the ellipticity of the UV second-harmonic beam. The experimental
behavior of the 2-OCWOC device was found to closely match the expecta-
tions derived from the general theory of 2N-OCWOC devices inasmuch as SH
eﬃciency enhancement and beam proﬁle improvement are considered.

∼

Due to the lack of more eﬃcient, deep UV transmitting borate materials and to
the deep UV high absorption loss of QPM ferroelectrics, 2N-OCWOC struc-
tures made from BBO inside enhancement resonators open up the prospect of
building powerful cw sources with improved beam quality in the deep UV at
any wavelength above
200 nm for quantum optics experiments. Our next
goal is to demonstrate with a multi-plate monolithic structure sub-watt-level
deep UV sources for the eﬃcient cooling and trapping of magnesium and silver
atoms from a thermal beam. For each speciﬁc targeted wavelength, a prelimi-
nary stringent experimental determination of the exact phase-matching angle
would be required prior to the design of the appropriate 2N-OCWOC struc-
ture. Although most useful for the design of cw laser sources, these periodic
devices should also prove useful in other BBO-based parametric generation
techniques such as chirped-pulse ampliﬁcation of ultra-short pulses (OPCPA),
∆k) wavevector periodic
minimizing spectral phase distorsion owing to the (
grating stemming from the walkoﬀ-compenstated arrangement [32] and en-
hancing the gain bandwidth of the ampliﬁcation process.

Abstract

Using a two-dipole model of an optical near-ﬁeld of Scanning Near-ﬁeld Optical Microscope tip,

i. e. taking into account contributions of magnetic and electric dipoles, we propose and analyze a

new type of 3D optical nanotrap found for certain relations between electric and magnetic dipoles.

Electric ﬁeld attains a minimum value in vacuum in the vicinity of the tip and hence such a trap

is quite suitable for manipulations with cold atoms.

Recent enormous progress in the study of laser-cooled atoms and molecules put forward

the problem of their using for quantum computing, frequency standard construction, and

other technological applications (see e.g. [1-3]). To achieve this goal, as well as for the further

progress of fundamental experiments in the ﬁeld, new compact traps and new methods of

“handling” the cold atoms, for example their transportation to/from a trap or between

diﬀerent traps, should be elaborated. An example of successful work in this direction is

given e.g. by “atom-chip technology” experiments [4, 5], where guiding of cold atoms along

the wires has been demonstrated. Further miniaturization of such devices is desirable.

Ideally, one should have at his/her disposal true “single cold atom nanotweezers” which

have very small sizes and only slightly perturb the trap. Evidently, the near-ﬁeld optical

conﬁgurations, based on subwavelength-size aperture in the apex of a sharp ﬁber tip or local

ﬁeld enhancement in the vicinity of sharp conducting tips (see e.g. [6, 7] for review on near-

ﬁeld optics) look rather promising. Hence it is not surprising that a number of near-ﬁeld

optical traps/tweezers have been proposed [7 - 15].

However, all of them have certain drawbacks and, we believe, this is the main reason

why, to the best of our knowledge, none has been realized up to now. Putting aside the

conﬁgurations where an extremum of the optical ﬁeld is achieved on the surface of the tip

[13] (conﬁguration obviously inappropriate for atom trap), among these drawbacks we could

mention that the traps proposed needed diﬀerent hard-to-control non-optical interactions

(centripetal potential, gravitational interaction, van der Waals force, etc.) to be closed, can

be realized only in the non practical light reﬂection mode from the subwavelength aperture,

and so on.

nanotweezers.

Here we propose and analyze the true “free standing”, or “support-free” purely optical 3D

trap emerging in vacuum in the vicinity of an aperture of the Scanning Near-ﬁeld Optical

Microscope (SNOM) tip. The characteristic size of our trap is small in comparison with

laser wavelength , so one indeed can speak about nanotrap. Because methods of Angstrom-

precision motion of SNOM tip are well elaborated, the same construction is cold atom

Our analysis is based on the two-dipole model of optical near ﬁeld occurring in the vicinity

of this tip, see Fig. 1. Such a model has been established recently, when it has been shown

that in addition to the classic Bethe and Bouwkamp consideration, where in the case of
normal incidence optical near ﬁeld is modeled by one magnetic dipole M (see e.g. Refs.

2

[16-18]), a ﬁeld of an electric dipole P should be added to describe correctly optical near-

ﬁeld of a real ﬁber tip [19]-[21]. This eﬀect is due mainly to the conical shape of the end

area of such tip, and for a variety of tips and light polarizations diﬀerent relations between
the values and mutual orientations of M , P dipoles can be anticipated.

In near ﬁeld of tip as in any laser ﬁelds, resonant atoms are subject to the optical dipole

force with the potential [22],[23]:

line width, and Ω = ω − ω0 is detuning between laser frequency ω and resonant frequency

of an atom ω0. Throughout the paper we consider the blue detuning Ω > 0, which results

in atom trapping at the minimum of laser ﬁeld intensity.It is well known that blue-detuned

gradient force optical traps based on minimum of an electric ﬁeld have essential advantages

(they do not heat trapped atoms, etc.) in comparison with those based on maximum of an

electric ﬁeld using red-detuned light [23].

To characterize the proposed 3D nanotrap let us consider electric ﬁeld of light in the

vicinity of a SNOM tip (i. e.

in the near-ﬁeld regions of both dipoles). Corresponding

electric ﬁeld of an electric dipole P has the form:

As intensity is a positive function of coordinates, zeros of intensity (9)correspond to true

0 . For typical experimental conditions,
an intensity of optical near ﬁeld at the aperture of SNOM tip is about I0 = 103 − 104W/cm2

[6,7]. This means that e. g. for alkaline atoms, which are characterized by resonant dipole
moments of the order of 10−17 SGSE and natural line widths Γ ∼= 107 − 108s−1 (for example,
for the 6S1/2–6P3/2 D2 transition of cesium atom at λ=852 nm, µ=8.01·10−18 CGSE and
Γ = 3.07 · 107s−1 [24]), traps with the depth of the order of a few milliKelvin, what is

quite standard for optical dipole gradient force – based traps, can be realized when using
Ω ∼= 100Γ, see (1). It is very important that under these conditions the trap will have about
10 energy levels of atomic motion with lowest level being about 10−4K.

It is worthwhile to note, that existence of such a 3D trap is highly nontrivial, because the

relevant ﬁeld components have very complicated structure (see Figs. 3, 4, 5), and it seems

very diﬃcult to provide a minimum for their sum.

Mathematically, by varying P and M ratio and other parameters of the problem, our trap

can be placed at any point on the symmetry axis. However, the two dipole approximation

used is not valid very close to the aperture plane z = 0. Its validity starts from z ∼ a,

5

where a is the radius of an aperture. Hence we should consider only such parameters where

the trap position occurs not too close to the aperture plane. Besides the condition | z |& a

allows us to neglect van der Waals attractive force which is always important in close vicinity

of tip surface.

if relation between the dipole values is

For our trap the minimum of intensity is stable against small perturbations. For example,

P = P0{i, 1, 0},

M = ±M0eiϕ{i, 1, 0}

(14)

then true 3D minimum still exists provided sin |ϕ| < 1

5 or −0.2 < ϕ < 0.2. Small variations

of z-components of momenta (Pz and Mz) also result in small variations of trap position.

Small mutual displacements (splitting) of dipoles in axial and/or radial directions also result

in variation of the trap. In the case when magnetic dipole is moving away from the trap,

that is in the case when electric dipole is placed between the trap and the magnetic one,

the trap suﬀers only minor shifts. In the case when magnetic dipole is placed between an

electric one and the trap, the intensity minimum disappears for large enough splitting, see

The retardation eﬀects in the near ﬁeld region generally are small. Nevertheless to esti-

mate their inﬂuence let us consider the full electric ﬁeld of electric and magnetic dipoles:

Analysis shows that for such a case 3d trap survives only when ξ = P0/M0 < 1.5035.

tardation eﬀects are taken into account, with the quasistatic results (11) we see that in the

case of magnetic dipole domination (ξ . 1) the position of the trap remains in the near ﬁeld

region and hence the retardation eﬀects have only minor inﬂuence. On the other hand, in

the case of substantially large amplitude of electric dipole, the retardation eﬀects destroy

our trap.

Hence we have shown that minimum of an electric ﬁeld with the size smaller than the light

wavelength and depth of a few milliKelvin did occur in vacuum in the vicinity of a SNOM

tip. This minimum is stable against perturbations and can be tuned both in position and

depth by changing relation between P0 and M0 and incident light electric ﬁeld amplitude

E0. This attests the trap proposed as a very promising basic element for future cold atom

nanotraps and nanotweezers. Finally, we would like to note the following. Despite the two

dipole model of optical near-ﬁeld, whose using is inherent to obtain the reported results,

nowadays seems is well established and supported by experiments [19-21], complete and

rigorous analysis of all possible dipole conﬁgurations occurring for near ﬁeld of a real tip is

still lacking. In particular, the conditions to be imposed on experimental setup to obtain

the trapping conﬁguration of magnetic and electric dipoles also remain to be understood.

Nevertheless, we believe that broad possibilities to vary SNOM tip shapes and coatings [6,

7] as well as to vary other parameters (e. g. incoming light polarization) give enough hope

for practical realization of such a conﬁguration. Indeed, it can quite happen that this is

already done at least for one of plenty of the tips demonstrated up to date.

We develop a theory of light transmission through an aperture-type near-ﬁeld optical probe with a
dissipative matter in its semiconducting core described by a complex frequency-dependent dielectric
function. We evaluate the near-ﬁeld transmission coeﬃcient of a metallized silicon probe with a

spectral range the use of a short silicon probe instead of a glass one allows to achieve a strong (up
to 102 − 103) enhancement in the transmission eﬃciency.

The development of scanning near-ﬁeld optical mi-
croscopy (SNOM) has already led to enormous progress
in studies of diﬀerent nanoscale phenomena. Among
other things, this technique is widely used for image for-
mation of various nanoobjects, single molecule ﬂuores-
cence detection, and for laser-induced ablation of a sam-
ple close to the tip apex (see [1, 2]). In the recent years
SNOM methods have been employed in studies of quan-
tum dots [3] and single-walled carbon nanotubes [4]. The
near-ﬁeld optical microscopy has opened a possibility for
direct observation of ﬁne features in the self-focusing ef-
fect [5], for imaging the light propagation in photonic
crystal waveguides [6] and the electromagnetic local den-
sity of states of optical corrals [7].

To improve eﬃciency of the aperture probes for the
SNOM technique one needs simultaneously to increase
their transmittance and spatial resolution capability. In
the present letter we study theoretically one possible way
to enhance the optical transmittance through a met-
allized near-ﬁeld probe with a subwavelength aperture.
We suggest to work in the visible region using a short
probe with a large taper angle with a core consisting of
a semiconducting matter with a high refractive index n.
The increase in transmittance with n occurs due to de-
crease of the light wavelength λc = 2πc/nω inside the
core. Consequently, at high n the cutoﬀ eﬀect, which
strongly reduces the light transmission through the probe
in the overdamped regime, aﬀects its transmission eﬃ-
ciency much less than for a glass. However, this gain
may be counterbalanced by the growth of light absorp-
tion in the dissipative medium of the core described by
the imaginary part of the frequency dependent dielectric
function ε(ω). To deal with these two competing tenden-
cies one needs a detailed theory.

The purpose of this letter is to develop an analytic
theory for transmission of visible light through a probe
with a core made of a dissipative semiconducting mat-
ter. Here we are encouraged by the transmission SNOM
experiments with a silicon probe at λ = 1.06 µm [8, 9],
which indicate that such probes are very promising in the
near-infrared (IR) region. The theoretical support for

this work comes from a comparative numerical analysis
of the transmission eﬃciencies of glass and silicon probes
at λ = 1.3 µm [10]. We have to note however, that the
above theory is restricted by the use of a two-dimensional
model with a loss-free dielectric core and small taper an-
gle of 15◦. The further experimental success was achieved
in [11], where the authors have employed a pyramidal Si
probe that was entirely coated with a thin metal ﬁlm to
increase the transmission eﬃciency in the near-IR region
(λ = 830 nm). An extremely high throughput (2.3 %)
was obtained in this experiment with a resolution capa-
bility about 85 nm. In the IR region the light absorption
in Si is suﬃciently small, but in the visible region the
imaginary part of its dielectric function rapidly increases
with a decrease of λ. So, dissipation of the electromag-
netic energy inside the silicon core and frequency dis-
persion of its dielectric function become important and
should be taken into account to get an adequate physical
pattern of light transmission through the probe.

The three-dimensional theory developed in the present
letter is valid for all taper angles including large ones
which are especially suitable for large transmittance
[12, 13]. The theory is based on the exact analytic de-
scription of the conical waveguide eigenmodes inside a
probe with a dissipative matter in its core and perfectly
conducting metallic walls. For a loss-free dielectric core,
similar approach has been developed in our recent work
[13]. Here we consider the case when the semiconducting
core has a complex dielectric function which is a nec-
essary feature of the visible region. This generalization
requires more than a trivial analytic continuation of our
previous results due to the necessity of describing the
eﬀects associated with frequency dispersion and light ab-
sorption inside the core matter. Such eﬀects lead to a
number of new features in light transmission through
semiconducting probes, which discuss below.

We consider here time-harmonic ﬁelds inside a cone
whose core consists of a dissipative medium and whose
walls are perfectly conducting. In spherical coordinates
the Helmholtz equation for the Hertz function U of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld inside a cone is

(r) of the Hertz func-

The dependence on the polar angle θ is determined by the
associated Legendre function of the ﬁrst kind P m

with power ν and order m (m is an integer).

For the transverse magnetic (TM) ﬁeld modes the
boundary condition at an interface between a core
medium and a perfectly conducting metallic coating of
a conical waveguide can be written as P m
ν (cos θ0) = 0,
where θ0 is the cone half-angle. Each choice of numbers m
and n in this equation (n denotes the number of its root)
determines a possible TMmn mode. The eigenvalues νmn
strongly depend upon the value of θ0 such that νmn de-
creases with an increase of θ0. In the most interesting
case of the lowest-order TM01 mode, the projections of
electric E and magnetic H ﬁelds onto the corresponding
axes of spherical coordinates (r, θ, ϕ), take the form

Further we evaluate the optical transmittance of a con-
ical waveguide with a dissipative matter in its core. For
a probe tapered to a subwavelength diameter it is nec-
essary to distinguish a near-ﬁeld transmission coeﬃcient
of a waveguide itself and the resulting transmission co-
eﬃcient to the far-ﬁeld zone (see [1, 13]). The near-ﬁeld
transmission coeﬃcient, T , can be expressed in terms of
the time-averaged energy densities associated with the
output and the input ﬁelds of the waveguide. For spher-
ical waves inside a cone, this coeﬃcient can be deﬁned
as the ratio T = W out

tions of Eq. (12). Then, the resulting expression for the

well all major features of light transmission through the
subwavelength aperture in a conical waveguide with a
dissipative matter in its core. It is seen that the values
of T are strongly dependent on the ratio a/λ, the taper
angle 2θ0, and the refractive index n. Moreover, accord-
ing to (13) the transmission coeﬃcient T is proportional
to cosh−1 ξ, where ξ = l/rκ is the ratio of the length of
the probe edge l to the attenuation length rκ = c/2κω
(at small a we have rin
l). It is clear that the high

achieved in the wavelength region far from the peak in its

Now we apply our theory for studies of the trans-
mittance of the visible and near-IR radiation through
the aperture-type metallized silicon probe. In the wave-
length region from 830 nm (¯hω = 1.5 ev) down to 400
nm (¯hω = 3.1 ev), the refractive index n of Si increases
monotonically from 3.67 to 5.57 and the attenuation co-
eﬃcient κ grows from 0.005 to 0.387. This results in quite
diﬀerent inﬂuence of light absorption in Si in the near-IR
and the short-wavelength part of the visible spectrum.

In Fig. 1 we present the wavelength dependences of
the near-ﬁeld transmission coeﬃcient of the metallized
silicon probe for the most interesting case of large taper
angle 2θ0 = 90◦ and for various values of the aperture
diameter 2a. To demonstrate a dependence of light ab-
sorption inside the Si core on the length of the probe edge,
we calculated the transmission coeﬃcient T for various
values of l. As expected, T is strongly dependent on the
aperture diameter in full agreement with simple formula
(13) derived in this work. However, the wavelength de-
pendence, obtained in the present work for the Si probe,
diﬀers dramatically from the case of a loss-free dielectric
(a/λ)2ν). As is evi-
core (a glass ﬁber), for which T
dent from Fig. 1, the transmittance of the silicon probe
strongly varies over the spectrum. If the length of the
probe edge is not too large (l <
10 µm), the transmis-
∼
sion coeﬃcient increases ﬁrst as the wavelength decreases
from the IR region, reaches its maximum at a deﬁnite
wavelength λmax, and then strongly falls at λ
λmax in
the short-wavelength part of the visible spectrum. The
position of the maximum λmax and the maximal value of
Tmax depends on the speciﬁc geometrical parameters of
the probe.

∝

It is important to stress that this maximum in the

transmission eﬃciency of a silicon probe lies at λ
−
800 nm (see Fig. 1). This occurs despite the fact that the
attenuation length rκ, associated with the imaginary part

n = 1.55 to make comparison with our recent results
[13]. For the probe with the length l = 2 µm and the
aperture diameter 2a = 50 nm we get TSi/Tglass = 2.2,
14, 45, and 71 for λ = 488, 532, 633, and 830 nm, respec-
tively. For the same parameters, but 2θ0 = 60◦ we have
TSi/Tglass = 43, 240, 800, and 960. According to our the-
ory, the enhancement occurs as a result of competition
between two factors: the rise of n and the decrease of the
attenuation length rκ (13). As follows from our results,
the former factor is more important in the most part of
the visible spectrum, provided the near-ﬁeld probe length
is suﬃciently short (no more than several µm), such that
eﬀects associated with the light absorption are not too
strong. We also would like to point out that in case of
an entirely coated probe the surface plasmon-polariton
propagation along the metallic cladding is likely to fur-
ther increase the resulting transmittance in accordance
with the mechanism discussed in Ref. [12].

in the visible region compared to the near-infrared one.
For example, at λ = 633 nm, 532 nm, and 488 nm, the
respective values of the attenuation length rκ turn out to
be equal to 2.66 µm, 0.84 µm and 0.45 µm, in contrast
with 13.53 µm at λ = 830 nm.

In summary, it follows from our calculations that at
large taper angles high values of the near-ﬁeld transmis-
sion coeﬃcient can be achieved for a passage of visible
light through Si core of an optical probe. To illustrate the
enhancement in the trasmittance of Si probes in compar-
ison with conventional ﬁber ones we compare the present
estimates for Si with those obtained for a core with small
n (glass or SiO2). Although the taper angles of ﬁber
probes do not usually exceed 40◦ which additionally re-
stricts their eﬃciency, we use the value 2θ0 = 90◦ and

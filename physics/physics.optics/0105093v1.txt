Abstract

The dynamical response of a relativistic bunch of electrons injected in a pla-

nar magnetic undulator and interacting with a counterpropagating electro-

magnetic wave is studied. We demonstrate a resonance condition for which

the free electron laser (FEL) dynamics is strongly inﬂuenced by the presence

of the external ﬁeld. It opens up the possibility of control of short wavelength

FEL emission characteristics by changing the parameters of the microwave

ﬁeld without requiring change in the undulator’s geometry or conﬁguration.

Numerical examples, assuming realistic parameter values analogous to those

of the TTF-FEL, currently under development at DESY, are given for possible

control of the amplitude or the polarization of the emitted radiation.

I. INTRODUCTION.

Since their ﬁrst experimental realization [1], free electron lasers (FEL) have been one

of the most promising sources of coherent electromagnetic radiation [2,3]. The physics of

FEL emission is radically diﬀerent from that of any other laser sources. In particular, the

tunability over a broad range of frequencies, and the brightness of its output are diﬃcult to

achieve in other lasing schemes. On the other hand, its polarization, pulse shape, etc. are

strongly connected with the geometry of the undulator and hence are inconvenient to modify.

At the same time, modiﬁcations in the typical undulator’s physical structure may induce

new features, e.g., FELs with two magnetic wigglers of diﬀerent spatial frequencies may

increase the radiation at higher harmonics [4], suppress the side bands [5], and may allow

the radiation spectrum [6] to be controlled. However, a systematic experimental exploration

of these possibilities is very ackward, if not precluded, due to the diﬃculty of engineering and

constructing the modiﬁed undulators for every such experiment. It is therefore worthwhile

to explore theoretically the possibility of achieving control of the amplitude and polarization

of the emitted radiation, specially at very short wavelengths, without having to alter the

undulator geometry.

The basic dynamics of the interaction of free electrons interacting with electromagnetic

waves has been studied in many circumstances in the past. They range from pioneering

studies of the radiation of a single electron driven by an electromagnetic wave [7,8], interac-

tion of relativistic electrons under general initial conditions with such radiations [9], charged

particle acceleration by simultaneous interaction with an electromagnetic wave and a static

electric ﬁeld [10,11], etc. Another important application of FEL principle is the particle

acceleration by the inverse mechanism. Particle acceleration by inverse free-electron-laser

principle has been demonstrated both theoretically [12] and experimentally [13,14]. In con-

trast, much less seems to be known for the complementary geometry, in which the electron

bunch interacts with a counterpropagating electromagnetic wave, perhaps because of the

absence of acceleration schemes for this case.

In this paper we explore the possibility of

2

modifying the electron dynamics in the ampliﬁcation stage of FEL, by means of the in-

teraction with a counterpropagating microwave ﬁeld. It will be shown that, under certain

conditions, the counterpropagating wave can inﬂuence strongly the dynamics of the elec-

trons inside the undulator. Thus, by a careful choice of the wave parameters control of

the dynamics can be achieved that could lead to desired FEL radiation properties without

requiring geometrical changes of the undulators.

II. ELECTRON DYNAMICS AND PHASE MATCHING CONDITION

Let us consider a modiﬁed FEL conﬁguration as depicted in Fig. 1: a free electron is

injected axially into a linearly polarized magnetic undulator, where an electromagnetic wave

propagates also axially, in opposite direction, inside a waveguide. The evolution of the elec-

tron motion, in the combined steady magnetic ﬁeld of the undulator and the electromagnetic

wave, is governed by the Newton-Lorentz equation

where ~Bu = f (x)Bu sin(kux)~ez is the undulator’s magnetic ﬁeld. The explicit form of the

counterpropagating ﬁeld depends on the waveguide geometry, as well as on the choice of

a particular transversal mode. Due to the small transversal dimensions of the electron

bunch used in FEL (of about some tens of microns), only the ﬁeld at the central axis

of the waveguide is relevant. The following discussion, therefore, may be applied to any

waveguide mode of any geometry, provided it has a non vanishing linearly polarized ﬁeld

along the central axis, which can be regarded as constant over the whole bunch’s section.

The choice of particular waveguide parameters will inﬂuence the quantitative values where

the interference condition considered below is attained. For concreteness, let us assume a

T En0 [15] mode propagating in a rectangular waveguide. The explicit forms for the electric

and magnetic ﬁeld now read as follows,

are considered slowly varying envelopes.

Without loss of generality (by shifting the time coordinate) we may assume that the

electron is initially at x = 0, moving along the x-axis with velocity v0. Before solving the

equation of motion numerically, we may gain a qualitative insight into the problem by ﬁrst

considering the dynamics in a new reference frame in which the electron is initially at rest.

In the new frame, the undulator’s magnetic ﬁeld becomes a counterpropagating time-varying

electromagnetic ﬁeld with

that this electromagnetic ﬁeld has two peculiarities: one, the magnetic and the electric ﬁeld

(large γ), the eﬀective ﬁeld observed by the electron can be considered as a T EM wave.

In addition, the phase velocity of this ﬁeld approaches c. These two facts, together with

0, which is ensured by the reduced dimensions of the electron bunch,

permit us to ascribe the eﬀective ﬁeld acting on the electron in its rest frame to a plane

the condition kcz′

wave.

By inspection of Eqs. (6-10), one sees that it is possible to derive a phase matching

condition in which both ﬁelds can be seen to have the same frequency in the moving frame,

provided that the waveguide has a transverse dimension greater than half the undulator’s

wavelength, a > λu

2 . Note that condition (11) has been calculated for the case of strongly

relativistic electrons, β

1. Although this result is derived for a rectangular waveguide, it

≈

is worth to stress that this is independent of the particular geometry (which is described

by the appropiate form of kc). Note also that the dependence of the frequency of the

electromagnetic wave on kc permits to attain the same phase matching condition for a

variety of electromagnetic waves, only by modifying the waveguide geometry.

As given by Eq. (11), the phase matching condition is deﬁned only for the temporal

oscillation. Since the undulator ﬁeld has a spatial phase dependence, the corresponding

wavenumber matching will hold only over a certain coherence length such that φu(ℓ′

coh) = π,

Before proceeding further, we may point out that the nature of the electron motion can

strongly depend on this coherence length and show an interesting disordered behavior when

the coherence length becomes comparable to the undulator’s wavelength. However, here we

are concerned with the condition in which the coherence length is greater than the total

undulator length. This condition is easily fulﬁlled by very high energy electrons. In this

situation the motion of the electron remains regular.

III. NUMERICAL INTEGRATION

As indicated above our objective is to study the possibility of modifying the FEL emis-

sion characteristics induced by the counterpropagating microwave ﬁeld, in a conﬁguration

similar to that being developed in DESY [16,17]. The initial conditions, hence, consist of

a relativistic electron-bunch entering the undulator in the presence of a very weak seed of

FEL radiation ﬁeld, which is assumed to be generated from vacuum noise in a ﬁrst stage

of the FEL laser. Since the bunch injection energy is high, the dynamics encloses two very

diﬀerent space-time scales, namely, that of the undulator’s ﬁeld and that corresponding to

the output radiation, which diﬀer typically by a factor γ2. This disparity becomes a limiting

diﬃculty for the numerical integration of the evolution equations, which is usually overcome

by using the appropriate slowly varying envelope approximations, along with the projections

on the ﬁeld cavity modes [18–20]. In this work we have chosen an alternative procedure [21]

which computes the radiated ﬁeld from the superposition of the Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁelds [22]

emitted from every pseudoparticle (see below) of the bunch. Furthermore, we have preferred

to integrate the equations in the initial rest frame of the bunch. This allows us to avoid the

problem associated to the disparity of scales since in this frame the undulator and radiated

ﬁeld have similar frequencies. Moreover, in the chosen frame, it becomes readily evident

that the bunch density is decreased by a factor γ

1, allowing us to neglect self-ﬁelds.

The large number of electrons per bunch (in our case

109) in the realistic situation forces

≫

≃

us to deﬁne pseudoparticles each of which include a few thousands of electrons that are

assumed to move together. Note that this is the same conceptual philosophy as employed

in the successful particle-in-cell (PIC) codes for the simulation of plasma dynamics [23,24].

6

The modulations of the charge density in the system can be modeled either by considering

the spatially variable distribution of equally charged pseudoparticles, or by a spatially uni-

formly distributed set of variably charged pseudoparticles. For convenience, we have chosen

the latter approach in the present investigation. To simulate the velocity and acceleration

of the pseudoparticles, we have used a relativistic Boris algorithm [24] and to calculate the

resulting emitted ﬁeld of the electrons in the forward direction, we have used the well-known

formula of the far ﬁeld radiation ﬁeld amplitude of an accelerated charged particle [22]:

where R is assumed to be large enough. Once the integration is performed, we Lorentz-

transform the computed quantities to the laboratory reference system.

IV. COHERENT CONTROL OF FEL RADIATION

In this section we will theoretically demonstrate the possibility of controlled FEL radia-

tion through the external electromagnetic wave. The key idea is to consider a counterprop-

agating wave resonant with the undulator ﬁeld, in the sense discussed in section II. The

frequency of the wave depends, therefore, on the spatial periodicity of the undulator’s mag-

netic ﬁeld and on the particular geometry of the waveguide. In our case, we take the 2.73cm

undulator’s wavelength of TTF-FEL at DESY [17], and a T E10 mode of a rectangular waveg-

uide of a size of 1.5cm , which is similar to the size of the beam pipe of the FEL at DESY.

Equation (11) deﬁnes the resonant condition for a counterpropagating electromagnetic wave

in the microwave region with λ = 2.99cm when propagating in free space.

In addition to a resonant frequency, the microwave control of the FEL ampliﬁcation is

more eﬀective for the case in which the amplitude of this ﬁeld in the bunch’s rest frame

equals the amplitude of the electromagnetic wave associated to the undulator’s ﬁeld. At

present, microwave ﬁelds in the GHz range are available with powers up to 100MW [25].

Although this is already close to the value needed to control optimally the radiation of the

7

TTF-FEL at DESY, we prefer to be conservative and to consider in this paper a tapered

undulator to reduce the undulator’s magnetic ﬁeld to 25 mT . With this values it should be

possible to demonstrate the microwave-control experimentally with current technology. On

the other hand, the state of the art of the microwave generation by the FEL concept allows

to foresee the availability of brighter sources in the near future [26].

Unless stated otherwise explicitly, the results are based on calculations for an electron

bunch (of 300 MeV) injected into a 4.5m magnetic undulator, whose characteristics have

been commented upon above. Our numerical tests show a posteriori that the assumption of

an initially cold bunch is acceptable. The bunch is described by a spatial sin2 distribution

of 20000 particles, 250µm long. Small changes of this number and/or the choice of bunch

shape is found not to aﬀect the conclusions drawn from the simulations.

In the following, we consider two cases of microwave control of free electron laser emission.

First, we will analyze the possibility of suppressing the FEL output by microwave interaction,

opening ways to control the pulse of the FEL radiation by modulation of the microwave

amplitude. Second, control of the polarization angle of the FEL radiation by changing the

microwave polarization. These possibilities are particularly interesting in view of the lack of

convenient optical elements at very short wavelengths to manipulate these characteristics of

FEL radiation once they are extracted from the source.

A. Coherent suppression of radiation

Let the counterpropagating microwave ﬁeld be linearly polarized, with the polarization

vector perpendicular to the direction of the undulator’s magnetic ﬁeld. The undulator ﬁeld

and the microwave ﬁeld may be, then, made to interfere destructively when they have their

phases properly matched at the a critical value of the amplitude of the microwave ﬁeld,

Ecrit =

kc
k0β + kw

Bu

(14)

Note that (like the phase matching condition, Eq. (11)) the critical ﬁeld becomes almost

independent of the energy of the electron in the highly relativistic case, β

1. Thus, a nearly

≈

8

complete destructive interference can occur for the sum magnetic ﬁeld, or B′

T = B′

u +B′

0 = 0,

for all time, in the moving frame.

In contrast, because of the asymmetry between the

magnetic and electric ﬁeld amplitudes of the (Lorentz-transformed) undulator ﬁeld, the

total electric ﬁeld in the moving frame, on the other hand, does not vanish exactly. A small

residual electric ﬁeld E′

res = γ(1

−

electron energy increases. Thus for β

res ≃
total electric ﬁeld becomes almost exactly fulﬁlled.

≈

1, E′

β)Bu remains, which, however, diminishes greatly as the

Bu/γ2, the interference condition for the

Fig. 2 shows the resulting suppression of FEL radiation calculated for diﬀerent initial

bunch energies. Note that, as expected, the ampliﬁcation gain is dramatically reduced as

the bunch energy increases. This is because the residual electric ﬁeld , E′

res vanishes with

increasing energy of the bunch. Note that, for the higher energies, the microwave ﬁeld

reduces the gain by nearly 3 orders of magnitude.

For the destructive interference mechanism to be eﬀective in practice, it is required a

constant π phase-diﬀerence between the undulator and the microwave ﬁelds, as seen in the

electron bunch’s reference system. Note that ensuring an initial π dephase requires a certain

control of the bunch’s conditions before injection, since the bunch must enter the undulator

when the microwave phase is opposite to the undulator’s. The required constancy is ensured

by (12) since the coherence length is greater than the undulator’s dimension for the range

of bunch energies assumed here (e.g., TTF-FEL).

To analyze the sensitivity of the coherent suppression eﬀect

against ﬂuctuations in the initial ﬁeld dephasing, we have performed a series of calcu-

lations in which the bunch’s initial position against the undulator vertex is changed. The

shift in the initial position is directly related to the time delay of the bunch to reach the

undulator and, therefore, to the initial dephase between the undulator and microwave ﬁelds

(in the rest frame of the bunch). The results of calculations with a 300MeV , 250µm bunch

are presented in Fig. 3 which shows the ampliﬁcation vs. ﬂuctuations in the bunch position.

It can be seen that the gain suppression eﬀect is robust against ﬂuctuations less than 1mm

that is well above the usual experimental uncertainty.

9

B. Control of polarization of FEL radiation

Polarization control is of particular interest for very short wave FEL radiation. This

can be achieved in the same conﬁguration by rotating the polarization of the microwave by

a certain angle from the undulator’s plane of polarization. From the theoretical analysis

above we expected that, in general, the emitted radiation will be elliptically polarized.

The ellipticity would depend on the initial dephase of the ﬁelds as well as their relative

amplitudes. We show in Fig. 4a the calculated change of ellipticity of FEL output vs. the

relative angle between the polarization plane of the undulator and that of the microwave

(chosen to be linearly polarized). The amplitudes of the undulator and microwave ﬁelds in

the rest frame of the bunch are chosen to be comparable while the initial dephase is set to

π/2. The resulting ellipticity of the emitted radiation is found (Fig. 4a) to change from the

linear to the circular polarization. The results of the various cases presented in this ﬁgure are

summarized in Fig. 4b in terms of the tilt-angle of the major axis of the polarization-ellipse

of the emitted radiation.

V. CONCLUSION.

Coherent modiﬁcations of FEL radiation induced by a counterpropagating electromag-

netic wave interacting with an electron bunch in a magnetic undulator are studied. A

phase-matching condition between the undulator ﬁeld and an external microwave ﬁeld in

the rest frame of a relativistic electron bunch is derived. This condition is found to only

depend on the geometry of the problem. It is found that possible control of both the ampli-

tude and the polarization of the FEL radiation (including very short wavelengths) could be

achieved without having to alter the undulator’s geometry, by simply varying the incident

microwave ﬁeld. Results of concrete numerical simulations assuming realistic FEL parame-

ters (corresponding to that of TTF-FEL, currently under development at DESY) are given,

and their robustness against small ﬂuctuations in initial conditions is illustrated.

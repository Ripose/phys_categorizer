Ferroelectric ordering, the electroclinic eﬀect and chiral smectic C (SmC*) - smectic A (SmA*)
phase transitions in thin planar ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) cells are studied by means of linear
electrooptic and second harmonic generation techniques. The ferroelectric switching is detected in
biased FLC cells by measuring azimuthal dependences of linear and nonlinear responses. The applied
DC-electric ﬁeld rotates the FLC symmetry axis with initial and ﬁnal orientations in the cell plane.
Comparative studies of the switching behavior in reﬂection and transmission allows to distinguish
the contributions from the bulk and the sub-surface layers of the cell. The analysis of temperature
dependence shows the existence of a strong surface coupling. The temperature dependent nonlinear
polarization shows a critical behavior corresponding to the superﬂuid model.

INTRODUCTION

Ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLC) have been studied
intensively for several decades. Chiral smectic liquid
crystals (LC) have unique material properties like spon-
taneous polarization [1]. Although a single chiral smectic
LC molecule has a non-zero dipole moment due to sym-
metry considerations
[2], LC molecules in the bulk of
the sample tend to form a helical structure which leads
to polarization compensation. The helix can be unwound
by application of a strong electric ﬁeld or using thin test
cells. Conventionally, alignment of LC is usually obtained
by unidirectional mechanical rubbing of a thin polymer
layer which coats the inner cell surfaces. Thus, the LC
molecules point their long axes along the rubbing direc-
tion. This anisotropic interaction inﬂuences the ferro-
electric ordering and the switching behavior which are of
great practical importance for any LC device. The fer-
roelectrically ordered SmC* phase is characterized by a
non zero angle between the molecular long axis and the
smectic layer normal. This tilt angle is the order parame-
ter used to describe the second order SmC*-SmA* phase
transition.

In several studies the temperature dependence of the
tilt angle below the critical temperature follows a power
law of 0.5 (classical behavior) [3], whereas in other stud-
ies it follows a power law of 0.3, in strong analogy with
the superﬂuid helium predicted by de Gennes [4]. The
SmA* phase in the vicinity of the transition point has
also been the subject of intensive investigations, since

of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Politecnica de
Catalunya, 08034 Barcelona, Spain

in that part of the critical region the electroclinic (EC)
eﬀect can induce a tilt angle which is proportional to
the electric ﬁeld strength [5]. The induced tilt angle is
also strongly temperature dependent and diverges as the
phase transition temperature is approached from above.
Another type of this phenomenon, the so-called surface
EC eﬀect,
is observed in the interfacial region of the
FLC cells and originates from the interaction of the sub-
surface layers of chiral smectic molecules and a localized
surface ﬁeld [6]. In the vicinity of the transition point,
the critical exponents of the tilt angle are in the range of
1.5 [4, 5, 6, 7]. The surface EC eﬀect results in
0.5
the existence of sub-surface region in which the director
is twisted from the rubbing axis to the bulk alignment
direction. The ferroelectric properties of these twisted
layers are of great importance as they play a dominant
role in LC-devices.

÷

In this paper we use linear electrooptic (EO) and sec-
ond harmonic generation (SHG) techniques for investi-
gation of ferroelectric ordering, SmC*-SmA* phase tran-
sitions and the EC eﬀect in thin FLC cells. The main
emphasis is made on comparative studies of the SHG
reﬂection and transmission experimental geometries in
order to ﬁgure out the roles of the sub-surface layers
and the bulk in ferroelectric phase transitions. The SHG
method is well-known for its sensitivity to symmetrical,
structural and electronic properties of surfaces, interfaces
and ultrathin ﬁlms, and has been widely used along with
EO for studying ferroelectric properties of chiral smectic
LC [8]. As the SHG response strongly depends on the
polar state of the matter because of its unique sensitivity
to the breakdown of the inversion symmetry [9], it is a
powerful instrument for probing ferroelectric phase tran-
sitions and electric-ﬁeld induced eﬀects in the vicinity of
the critical region.

II. MODEL DESCRIPTION

We studied linear and nonlinear quadratic responses
of the FLC cells upon application of an electric ﬁeld and
temperature variation up to the SmC*-SmA* phase tran-
sition. Chiral smectic LC belong to the C2 point group
symmetry with the symmetry axes oriented in the cell
plane. A schematic representation of the FLC cell and
the coordinate system is shown in ﬁg. 1. In this coordi-
nate frame Oz is the normal to the cell, XY is the cell
plane and the C2 axis is parallel to the Oy direction and
coincide with the main optical axis. We assume the FLC
cell to be uniaxial, with the ordinary and extraordinary
refractive indices n0 = nx = nz, and ne = ny, respec-
tively. The transmittance of an optically active plate of
the thickness d and birefringence ∆n at the wavelength
λ in crossed-polarizers geometry is determined by the
equation:

T = sin

(1)

where α is the angle between the main optical axes and
polarization direction of the incident light. The linear
electro-optic tensor rijk, where indices i, j, k denote the
axes of the cell coordinate system, for the given symmetry
has 8 non-vanishing components rxxy, ryyy, rzzy, ryzx,
ryzz, rxzy, rxyx, rxyz [10]. Application of the DC electric
ﬁeld E along Oz direction leads to the rotation of the
optical axes, which could be interpreted in terms of the
rotation of the ellipse of refractive indexes. The equation
of index ellipsoid in the presence of the electric ﬁeld E
has the form

The transformation of (2) to the canonical form gives the
DC ﬁeld-induced rotation of the undisturbed system of
coordinates based on the main optical axes. Considering
the rotation only around Oz-axis, the inﬂuence of the
electric ﬁeld can be described by the tilt of the main
optical axis in the cell plane with the dependence of the

The nonlinear quadratic susceptibility tensor of the FLC
cell with a C2 symmetry is given by following non-
vanishing components χijk, χyxx, χyyy, χyzz, ,χyzx, χxyz,
χxxy, χzyz, χzxy
[11]. The contribution to the SHG
intensity of each quadratic susceptibility component de-
pends on the angle of incidence of the fundamental ra-
diation, on the azimuthal position of the sample and
polarizations of the input and SHG light. In transmis-
sion geometry at normal incidence only three components
participate in SHG - χyxx, χxxy and χyyy, and for pp -
geometry the SHG intensity can be expressed by:

I 2ω
pp ∼

2
cos2 θ(χyyy cos2 θ + (2χxxy + χyxx) sin

θ)2,

(4)

where the azimuthal angle θ is the angle between the
direction of the p-polarization and C2 axes of the cell
symmetry. By ﬁtting the anisotropy dependences of the
SHG intensity in all polarization combinations, the corre-
sponding components of the quadratic susceptibility can
be extracted.

According to a well-known model, in the smectic pla-
nar layers FLC molecules can precess on the surface of the
smectic cone [12]. Ferroelectric switching is attributed
to the interaction between molecular dipoles and exter-
nal electric ﬁeld and results in rotation of the molecules
and, correspondingly, of the symmetry axes, within the
half of the smectic cone.
If the molecular director po-
sitions, corresponding to the saturating electric ﬁelds of
opposite values, are in the cell plane and on the opposite
sides of the smectic cone, then (3) can be used for the
explanation of linear and nonlinear switching, as it shows
the in-plane rotation of the main optical axis.

The angle between the molecular long axis and the
normal to the smectic layers, i.e. the apex angle of the
cone, is the order parameter of the SmC*-SmA* phase
transition, vanishing in the SmA* phase. It can also have
a ﬁnite magnitude in the SmA* phase and diverge in the
vicinity of the critical temperature due to the EC eﬀect.
The temperature-induced changes of this angle lead to
the changes in α and θ angles which are determined by
the orientation of the main axis. We show below that the
temperature and electric ﬁeld dependences of the main
axis orientation can be deduced from linear and nonlinear
optical experiments, in order to describe the ferroelectric
switching, phase transitions and the EC eﬀect in FLC
cells.

III. EXPERIMENT

The principle arrangement of the experimental setup
is described elsewhere [13]. Brieﬂy, an OPO laser sys-
tem is used as a source of the fundamental radiation,
with the output wavelength of 537 nm, repetition rate

10 Hz and pulse duration 4 ns. An appropriate set of
color ﬁlters is used for linear and nonlinear eﬀects mea-
surements. A photodiode or a PMT tube and gated elec-
tronics are used as a registration system for linear or non-
linear experiments. The temperature is varied from 20
to 55 oC, and automatically controlled by a digital ther-
mocouple thermometer with the accuracy of 1oC. An
electric ﬁeld in the range of -15 to +15 MV/m is applied
along OZ axis through the ITO electrodes. Commercial
FLC cells (E.H.C. Co., Tokyo) of a nominal thickness of
2 µm are used. These cells have an unidirectional rubbed
polyimide surface layer. The samples are prepared by a
slow cooling of the mixture [13], capillary ﬁlled in the
isotropic phase. The critical temperature of the SmC*-
SmA* phase transition for the studied mixture is about
42oC.

To determine the in-plane components of the nonlin-
ear susceptibility, the SHG intensity vs. azimuthal angle
is measured at normal incidence in transmission geom-
etry for diﬀerent polarization combinations - pp, ss, ps,
sp, where the ﬁrst letter denotes polarization of the inci-
dent light, and the second one - polarization of the light
transmitted through the analyzer, placed after the sam-
ple. The observed anisotropy is shown in ﬁg. 2a, b and
correlates well with the dependence (4), obtained for a
C2 symmetry structure. No electric ﬁeld is applied.

Ferroelectric switching of the cells is studied by mea-
suring the anisotropy dependences of the SHG intensity
at diﬀerent values of the external DC electric ﬁeld applied
along the normal to the cell plane. Fig. 3a shows the SHG
intensity in transmission geometry for pp-polarizations
and for two applied DC ﬁelds of opposite sign. The de-
pendences are shifted relative to each other, the phase
diﬀerence is about 30o.
In ﬁg. 3b the dependences of
the SHG intensities vs. electric ﬁeld are shown for dif-
ferent anisotropy positions of the cell. The anisotropy
position determines the contrast value of the switching
dependences and the ratio between SHG responses cor-
responding to opposite biases. Switching in reﬂection
geometry also exhibits a shift of the anisotropy depen-
dences for opposite electric ﬁelds with a phase diﬀerence
of about 20o.

Linear transmittance anisotropy is measured in crossed
polarizers geometry and is shown in ﬁg. 2c. Application
of the electric ﬁeld leads to a shift of the linear transmit-
tance anisotropy, as in the nonlinear case. In both cases,
we observed a shift of about 30o.

Temperature dependences of the SHG response are
taken in reﬂection geometry at incident angle about 45o
and in transmission at normal incidence. The cases of
the presence and absence of external DC ﬁeld are stud-
ied. Fig. 4a shows temperature dependences of the SHG
intensity in pp transmission geometry for biased (ﬁlled
circles and squares) and unbiased (open circles) cells. In
the absence of the electric ﬁeld the temperature depen-
dence of the SHG intensity approaches a constant value
at critical temperature in accordance with a power law
at T < Tc, and shows no manifestation of the surface EC

ples, a critical behavior of the SHG intensity due to the
EC eﬀect is obtained in the SmA* phase in the vicinity
of the phase transition, which is seen from the divergent
behavior of the SHG intensity at T > Tc, similar to the
critical behavior of the tilt angle.

IV. DISCUSSION

FLC cell structure usually contains layers with diﬀer-
ent direction of spontaneous polarization - twisted or he-
licoidally wounded layers. This modulation of the space
orientation of molecular dipoles is governed by the in-
termolecular forces and substrate inﬂuence. We suppose
that in the absence of the DC electric ﬁeld the cell has a
net dipole moment and axis of C2 symmetry laying in the
cell plane. Then it is possible to approximate anisotropy
dependences of SHG intensity in all possible polarization
combinations in transmission at normal incidence by for-
mulas analogous to (4) for pp case. In ﬁg. 2 calculated
curves are shown for all geometries. The approximation
gives the ratios between in-plane components of nonlin-

The linear transmittance anisotropy has four equal
peaks and no dark extinction, which is typical for twisted
structures. Assuming the main optical axis to lay in
the cell plane, approximation of the linear anisotropy de-
0.041, which
pendence by (1) gives a birefringence of
corresponds to the characteristic values for smectic LC
measured by other authors [8]. Comparison of nonlin-
ear and linear anisotropy dependences indicates that C2
symmetry axis, corresponding to the maximum of the
SHG anisotropy in pp-geometry, and the main optical
axis, corresponding to the minimum of the linear trans-
mittance anisotropy in sp-geometry, are parallel.

∼

Temperature dependences of the SHG intensity for the
applied electric ﬁeld of diﬀerent polarities reveal a hys-
teresis free SmC*-SmA* second order phase transition.
A typical critical behavior in the vicinity of the SmC*-
SmA* phase transition is obtained. A non-zero SHG sig-
nal in the SmA* phase denotes that some part of the cell
is still oriented and have a polar order with an in-plane
component of the nonlinear polarization. The tempera-
ture dependence of the SHG response for reﬂection geom-
etry shows qualitatively the same behavior as in trans-
mission geometry, which is connected with the SmC*-
SmA* phase transition in the sub-surface layer of the cell.
The SHG temperature dependence can be explained by
the interference of the ﬁeld and temperature dependent

and independent contributions to nonlinear polarization,
responsible for the SHG signal. Then, we can write for
the nonlinear polarization

the transmitted SHG the correlation length is about 5
microns, while for reﬂection it is about 0.1 micron [14],
which indicates that in reﬂection a thin sub-surface layer
participates in SHG. As SHG temperature dependences
of sub-surface layers and the bulk have the same qualita-

from (6) should be the same functions of E and T , or the

Explanation of temperature dependences demands the

ization. Orientation of the molecules in the bulk layers
of the cell can be electric-ﬁeld independent in some ex-
perimental geometries depending on the layer packing,
but temperature dependence is obligatory because of the
presence of the SmC*-SmA* phase transition. Then the
non-switching layer should be in the sub-surface region.
We can assume that a ”frozen” sub-surface layer, with
a thickness smaller than the correlation length for SHG
in reﬂection geometry, exists. It is strongly stabilized by
the surface coupling, and does not respond to any ex-
ternal electric ﬁeld or temperature variations, as well as
the layer closest to the substrate. The latter has only
z -component of the nonlinear polarization, as the dipole
moments of its molecules are directed along the normal
to the substrate plane, and then it does not contribute
to the SHG at normal incidence. But the rest of the
”frozen” region contains layers with in-plane components
of spontaneous polarization due to the twist near the sur-
face, and thus participates in the SHG at any angle of
incidence.

Let us ﬁgure out the interconnection between the tem-
perature dependences of SHG and the order parameter
of the SmC*-SmA* phase transition. Usually the order
parameter of this phase transition is the tilt angle, as
spontaneous polarization is compensated because of the
helical structure. The thickness of the cells studied in this
paper is smaller than the helix pitch, besides, anisotropic
interaction with the substrate produces an additional ori-
entational order of the FLC molecules, so that the cells
have spontaneous polarization −→P sp in SmC* phase. −→P sp
decreases in SmA* phase and is a linear function of the
tilt angle θ(E, T ). So we can write for the SHG intensity:

assuming that pI 2ω(E, T ) has the same critical depen-
dence on temperature as the tilt angle. Then, according
to (6) and (7), the temperature dependent contribution
pI 2ω(E, T ) in the absence of the electric ﬁeld and for
T < Tc can be approximated by the following expres-

in ﬁg. 4a by a solid line, with β = 0.31, in correspondence
to the theory of phase transition in a superﬂuid helium.
To compare the temperature behavior of the nonlinear
polarization in the vicinity of the phase transition for re-
ﬂection and transmission cases, we introduce the contrast

ter near the phase transition. Introducing SHG intensity

Approximation of experimental dependences by (11) in
the SmC* phase gives β = 0.31 (ﬁg. 4b), as in the case of
the absence of the ﬁeld. The amplitude of the contrast
(11) depends on the ratio P 2ω
const of ﬁeld depen-
dent and independent contributions to the nonlinear po-
larization. In transmission this ratio can be bigger due to
the larger amount of layers participating in ferroelectric
switching, besides, the ﬁeld independent contribution of
the boundary layer leads to the contrast decrease in re-
ﬂection geometry. These considerations explain why the
contrast of temperature dependences and electric ﬁeld-
induced shift of anisotropy dependences in transmission
are bigger than in reﬂection geometry, as obtained in the
experiment.

Temperature dependence of the contrast in the re-
gion of the EC eﬀect, at T > Tc, can be written in

Approximation of experimental data (ﬁg. 4b) gives γ =

Application of a DC electric ﬁeld to the FLC leads to
a shift of anisotropy dependences of the linear and non-
linear responses, as shown in ﬁg. 3a. Similar pictures
are obtained in the reﬂection case. As the character of
anisotropy dependences is the same in the presence of the
ﬁeld, our suggestion of the switching mechanism based on
the symmetry axis rotation in the cell plane seems to be
rather realistic. The shift originates from the rotation of
the molecules in the switching layers, the resulting non-
linear polarization of the cell is the sum of unchanged
quadratic polarization from the ”frozen” layer and from
ﬁeld-dependent region with the new position of the sym-
metry axes. Thus for approximating the SHG anisotropy

6

dependence in the presence of the electric ﬁeld, we divide
the nonlinear polarization into two parts, and (4) can be
rewritten as:

typical hysteresis width and do not exceed 1 V/micron.
The value of b corresponds to the tilt of the symmetry
axis in the cell plane, discussed above (3).

where g is the eﬀective thickness of switching layer rela-

mated to be 0.5 which indicates that the magnitude of the
ﬁeld-independent contribution is comparable to the ﬁeld-
dependent one, allowing eﬀective mutual interference in
accordance with (6). Symmetry axis shift dθ between
opposite values of the voltage is about 52o. For electric
ﬁeld dependences of the SHG intensity, shown in ﬁg. 3b,
the independent variable is the electric ﬁeld and in (14)
the azimuthal angle θ is ﬁxed by the anisotropy position.
Then dθ becomes a function of the electric ﬁeld, chosen,
according to (3), as a saturation function:

dθ(E) = b arctan(c(E

dE)),

(15)

−

where b and c are constants, depending on the strength
of interaction between ﬁeld and angle, and dE is a con-
stant determined by the switching history, as ferroelec-
tric switching of SHG intensity exhibits characteristic
ﬁeld hysteresis. Experimental dependences in ﬁg. 3b are
taken for two anisotropy positions with the diﬀerence in
θ
130 degrees. Fitting one of the curves by (14) with
(15) allows to extract b = 0.5 and c = 0.63. Varying then
only dE and θ during approximation of the second curve
gives the diﬀerence of the anisotropy position of about
126 degrees, in good agreement with experimental con-
ditions. Values of dE in both cases lay in the region of

∼

In conclusion, the electroclinic eﬀect, the SmC*-SmA*
phase transition and ferroelectric switching have been
studied in thin planar cells of ferroelectric chiral liquid
crystals by means of electrooptic and second harmonic
generation techniques. The analysis of the temperature
dependences of nonlinear quadratic response in the
critical region leads to the assumption of a strong
surface coupling existence, resulting in the stabilizing of
several ”frozen” subsurface twisted layers, independent
on electric ﬁeld and temperature. Critical exponents in
the vicinity of the SmC*-SmA* phase transition show a
behavior corresponding to the superﬂuid helium theory.
Ferroelectric switching has been observed in linear and
nonlinear anisotropic responses and has been explained
by the model, assuming in-plane rotation of symmetry
and main optical axes of the cells in the presence of
external electric ﬁeld.

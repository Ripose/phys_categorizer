Abstract

We explore the eﬀects of ultrafast shaped pulses for two-level systems that

do not have a single photon resonance by developing a multiphoton density-

matrix approach. We take advantage of the fact that the dynamics of the

intermediate virtual states are absent within our laser pulse timescales. Under

these conditions, the multiphoton results are similar to the single photon and

that it is possible to extend the single photon coherent control ideas to develop

multiphoton coherent control.

I. INTRODUCTION

Use of optimally shaped pulses to guide the time evolution of a system and thereby

control its future is an active ﬁeld of research in recent years [1]- [16]. Such developments

have been spurred by technological breakthroughs permitting arbitrarily amplitude mod-

ulated laser pulses with 20-30 fs resolution and pulse energies ranging to almost hundred

microjoules–either in the time domain or in the frequency domain. In most practical cases,

computer optimizations are used to generate the useful shapes [1]- [7], since even approx-

imate analytical solutions exist only for very specialized cases [7]- [12]. Such computer

simulations have resulted in generating quite complicated theoretical waveforms that can

break strong bonds [1]- [4], localize excitation [13]. Most of these interesting calculations

involve intense pulses, which do not operate in the linear response regime. Actual photo-

chemical processes with such intense pulses that operate beyond the linear response region

often involve multiphoton eﬀects. Unfortunately, multiphoton interactions typically induce

additional complications and have not yet been explored much theoretically for coherent

control purposes. In fact, most models for coherent control deal with light-matter interac-

tion at the single-photon level. However, some recent experiments show that they can even

simplify quantum interference eﬀects; e.g., how Cs atoms can be made to absorb or not

absorb light with non-resonant two-photon excitation with shaped optical pulses [14,15].

The experimental results have been treated with a perturbation model that works under

the resonant condition. However, a more complete theoretical treatment of multiphoton

interactions for developing multiphoton coherent control is quite complex and is far from

complete. In fact, the lack of such a theoretical basis is also evident from the fact that in the

classic demonstration of control of multiphoton ionization process, an experimentally opti-

mized feedback pulse shaping was found to provide the best-desired yield [16]. In the present

work, we develop a density matrix approach to multiphoton processes that do not have any

lower-order process and demonstrate that can also explain the oﬀ-resonance behavior.

We present results, which show that this would be a promising approach. We ﬁrst apply

2

the approach to the two-photon scenario in a simple two-level system (e.g., any narrow,

single-photon transition line that is only multiphoton allowed). We then generalize the

results to the case where only one N-photon (N

2, which is multiphoton) transition is

≥

possible and none of the (N-1) photon transition can exist. Under these conditions, we

show that most of the waveforms produce the same results as the single photon case [18].

With care, therefore, we predict that it will be possible to extend some of the single photon

coherent control ideas to develop multiphoton coherent control. We explore the various

frequency-swept pulses into the multiphoton domain, which have been previously shown to

be successful in inducing robust inversions under single-photon adiabatic conditions. We also

investigate the case of phase modulated overlapped Gaussian pulses for two-photon transition

(in the spirit of a “dark” pulse of Meshulach and Silberberg, which they deﬁned as “a single

burst of optical ﬁeld” that does not produce any net population transfer [15]). We show

that the two-photon dark pulses, which are a result of smoothly varying phase modulation,

can be explained by invoking the well-established concept of single photon adiabatic rapid

passage (ARP) [17,18] to the multiphoton framework. In fact, the ARP explanation allows

us to generalize the results to the N-photon case and show that such dark pulses are a result

of the Stark shifting of the resonant Nth photon transition. The extension of the concept of

ARP into the multiphoton domain has very important consequences in generating inherent

robust processes.

II. FORMALISM

The simplest model describing a molecular system is an isolated two-level system or

ensemble without relaxation or inhomogeneities. This simple model often turns out to be a

very practical model for most systems interacting with the femtosecond laser pulses as the

magnitude of the relaxation processes are immensely large as compared to the femtosecond

interaction time. Let us consider a linearly polarized pulse is being applied to the

1>

transition, where

1> and

2> represent the ground and excited eigenlevels, respectively,

|

|

3

of the ﬁeld-free Hamiltonian.

In case of single photon interactions (Fig. 1a), the total

laboratory-frame Hamiltonian for such two-level system under the eﬀect of an applied laser
ﬁeld, E (t) = ε (t) ei[ω(t)t+φ(t)] = ε (t) ei[ω+ ˙φ(t)]t can be written as [10,17]:

H =

where ωR = ω2 −

ω1 is resonance frequency, V12 and V21 are the negative interaction poten-

is the transition dipole moment of the

1>

|

interaction as given in Eqn. (1), the interaction potential under the eﬀect of an applied laser

ﬁeld, in two-photon absorption case (Fig. 1b) can be written as:

V (t) = µ1mε (t) ei(ω t+φ(t))

µm2ε (t) ei(ω t+φ(t))

(2)

where m is the virtual state. Let us, for simplicity, take the transition dipole moment

between the ground state to the virtual sate to be equal to the transition dipole moment

between the virtual state and excited state (µ1m = µm2 = µ). In fact, we have veriﬁed in our

simulations that the trend of the results is preserved even when we relax this simpliﬁcation.

In any event, for developing the initial model, the above said simpliﬁcation allows us to take

µ as a common factor and we can rewrite Eqn. (2) as:

V (t) = (µ ε (t))2 e2i(ω t+φ(t))

since for normalized states, < m

m > = 1. Using similar arguments for the N-photon case

(Fig. 1c), the interaction potential can be written as:

V (t) = (µ ε (t))N eiN (ω t+φ(t))

Thus, the total laboratory-frame N-photon Hamiltonian will be:

The virtual levels for the two-photon (or N-photon) case can exist anywhere within the

bandwidth ∆ω of the applied laser pulse (Fig. 1) and the individual virtual state dynamics

is of no consequence.

In analogy to the single photon case [11,12], there are two diﬀerent ways to transform the

elements of the above laboratory frame N-photon Hamiltonian (Eqn. (5)) into a rotating

frame of reference. Any time-dependent transformation function T can be applied on both

sides of the Schrodinger equation as follows:

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

T (cid:16)i¯h ∂
i¯h ∂

∂tΨ = HΨ(cid:17)
i¯h ∂T
∂t (T Ψ)
∂t (T Ψ) = hT HT −1 + i¯h ∂T

∂t (T −1T ) Ψ = T H (T −1T ) Ψ
∂t T −1

i (T Ψ)

−

i¯h ∂

which results the following transformation equation:

H T ransf ormed = T HT −1 + i¯hT −1 ∂T
∂t

The usual frame of reference would be to rotate at Nω. This is the phase-modulated

(PM) frame of reference, which can be derived from the Hamiltonian H of Eqn. (5) by the

transformation:

Using of Eqn. (7), the transformed Hamiltonian in the PM frame is:

T P M =








µ(ε∗(t))N

e−iN φ 0

µ(ε(t))N
¯h

eiN φ







under the assumption that the transient dipole moment of the individual intermediate virtual

states in the multiphon ladder all add up constructively to the ﬁnal state transition dipole

moment and can be approximated to a constant (µ) over the N-photon electric ﬁeld interac-

tion. This approximation is particularly valid for the case of multiphoton interaction with

femtosecond pulses where no intermediate virtual level dynamics can be observed. Thus,

we deﬁne multiphoton Rabi Frequency, as the complex conjugate pairs: Ω(t)=µ.(ε(t))N /¯h

5

and Ω∗(t)=µ.(ε∗(t))N /¯h, and the time-independent multiphoton detuning as: ∆ = ωR −
(Fig. 1c). However, in order to investigate the oﬀ-resonance behavior of continuously mod-

Nω

ulated pulses, in the single photon case, it is useful to perform an alternate rotating-frame

transformation to a frequency modulated (FM) frame with the transformation function:

T F M =

e−iN ω t+φ

2







0

eiN ω t+φ






to transform the N-photon laboratory Hamiltonian in Eqn. (5) to the FM frame as:

H F M = ¯h

∆ + N ˙φ (t) µ.(ε(t))N
µ.(ε∗(t))N
¯h

0

= ¯h





Ω∗







0

The time derivative of the phase function ˙φ (t), i.e., frequency modulation, appears

as an additional resonance oﬀset over and above the time-independent detuning ∆, while

the direction of the ﬁeld in the orthogonal plane remains ﬁxed. The time evolution of

the unrelaxed two-level system can then be evaluated by integrating the Liouville equation

[10,17]:

dρ (t)
dt

=

i
¯h hρ (t) , H F M (t)i

where ρ(t) is a 2

2 density matrix whose diagonal elements represent populations in the

×

ground and excited states and oﬀ-diagonal elements represent coherent superposition of

states. This approach has been very successful in solving many single-photon inversion

processes for arbitrarily shaped amplitude and frequency modulated pulses [12], [13]. We

have just extended the same arguments to the multiphoton case.

The simulations are performed with a laser pulse that either has (a) a Gaussian intensity

proﬁle or (b) a hyperbolic secant intensity proﬁle which have the following respective forms:

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

(a)

I (t) = I0exp h−
implies ε (t) = ε0exp h−

8ln2 (t/τ )2

4ln2 (t/τ )2

(b)

I (t) = I0sech2

hn2ln (cid:16)2 + √3(cid:17)o (t/τ )i
implies ε (t) = ε0sech hn2ln (cid:16)2 + √3(cid:17)o (t/τ )i

6

where τ is the full width at half maximum, and I(t) is the pulse intensity. This is because

most of the commercially available pulsed laser sources have these intrinsic laser parameters.

We choose a range of frequency sweeps, such as (c) the linear frequency sweep for the

Gaussian amplitude, (d) the hyperbolic tangent sweep for the hyperbolic secant amplitude,

and they have the following respective forms:

(c)

(d)

˙φ (t) = bt
˙φ (t) = b n2ln (cid:16)2 + √3(cid:17)o tanh hn2ln (cid:16)2 + √3(cid:17)o (t/τ )i

where b is a constant. Such pulses have been shown to invert population through ARP in

single photon case and so we choose to use these particular shapes for the multiphoton case.

We also use the shaped overlapping Gaussian pulses for a two-photon transition similar

to the ones used by Meshulach and Silberberg. In their case the frequency sweep is given

by:

(14)

(15)

˙φ (t) =

b

b
−





t

t0

≥
t < t0

where t0 is the midpoint of the pulse. This pulse does not satisfy the ARP condition and

is quite susceptible to the changes in the pulse amplitude proﬁle and our results show this

in the next section. However, if we instead use smoothly varying linear frequency sweeps,

either changing monotonically as in Eqn. (14c), or linearly approaching and going away

from resonance as given by:

˙φ (t) = bt, where b changes sign at t0

(16)

These pulses satisfy the ARP conditions as explained in the next section. Dark pulses

given by Eqn (16) are thus quite insensitive to the changes in the pulse amplitude proﬁle.

We also extend our calculations to the N-photon case in a simple two-level type of system

that supports only an Nth photon transition and show how the phase switches eﬀect the

population cycling. These generalizations would become evident when we examine the

results based on the ARP extended to multiphoton case.

III. RESULTS & DISCUSSION

The population evaluation in a simple two level system without relaxation for one photon

absorption (N=1) is shown in Fig. 2 for the pulse shapes given by Eqns. (13) and (14).

Excitation exactly on resonance creates a complete population inversion when the pulse

area (the time integral of the Rabi frequency) equals π. However, the population oscillates

between the ground and excited state as sine function with respect to the Rabi frequency.

These oscillations are not desirable in most cases involving real atoms or molecules. They are

washed out by inhomogeneous broadening, the transverse Gaussian proﬁle of the laser, and

(in the molecular case) diﬀerent values of µ.ε. For a single-photon case, as discussed in Ref.

[18], frequency modulated pulses can instead produce adiabatic inversion, which avoids these

complications. A linearly frequency swept (chirped) laser pulse can be generated by sweeping

from far above resonance to far below resonance (blue to red sweeps), or alternatively from

far below resonance to far above resonance (red to blue sweeps). When the frequency

sweep is suﬃciently slow such that the irradiated system can evolve with the applied sweep,

the transitions are “adiabatic”.

If this adiabatic process is faster than the characteristic

relaxation time of the system, a smooth population inversion occurs with the evolution of

the pulse, which is the well-known ARP.

Let us now extend the eﬀect of such laser pulses (given by Eqns. (13) and (14)) to a

two-photon (N=2) case as derived in our Hamiltonian of Eqn. (11). Fig. 3 shows the plots

of the upper state population (ρ22) as a function of applied Rabi frequency and detuning

for two photon absorption case in the absence of one photon absorption. We ﬁnd that the

results are qualitatively the same as the one-photon absorption. In fact, our simulations

show that for such a simple case of a two-level system, where only an Nth photon transition

is possible, we can extend our single-photon results to the N-photon case. The diﬀerence

lies in the Rabi frequency scaling. Thus, for this simple case as deﬁned here, we are able to

invoke the concept of ARP for multiphoton interaction.

We next use the overlapping Gaussian pulses (when the overlap is complete it collapses

8

into a single Gaussian) with diﬀerent phase relationships. Our simulation shows that for

shaped overlapping Gaussian pulses the excited sate population depends on the form of the

frequency sweep. In ﬁgure 4a, for the shaped pulse without sweep the population of excited

state oscillates symmetrically. For a simple monotonically increasing or decreasing sweep

around resonance, it behaves like a Guassian pulse with linear sweep (Fig. 4b). These

results essentially conﬁrm another important implication of the adiabatic principle: that

the exact amplitude of the pulse is not very important under the adiabatic limit. Again, for

this simple case, we are able to invoke the concept of ARP for multiphoton interaction to

explain the inversion.

The phase modulated overlapped Gaussian pulses are of interest since Meshulach and

Silberberg had experimentally switched the phase of the second pulse with respect to the

ﬁrst pulse and demonstrated two-photon excited state population modulation. However, the

phase switch in their pulse shapes was abrupt as given by Eqn. (15), and thus did not satisfy

the ARP condition. As a result the population transfer with such pulses are very heavily

dependent on the actual shape of the pulse. Figs. 5 shows that the upper state population

for two photon absorption in the absence of one photon absorption is heavily dependent

on the nature of the phase step, the intensity and the extent of overlap of the pulses. At

some particular phase switch, there is no excited-state population, and they called it the

dark pulse. We show that it is indeed true for a speciﬁc overlapped amplitude proﬁle and

intensity for a given phase switching position. These dark pulses, however, are sensitive to

the exact nature of the amplitude proﬁle and intensity.

If instead we choose a smoothly varying linear frequency sweeping to the two-photon

resonance and then away from resonance, as given by Eqn. (16), the results are quite robust

to the exact nature of the amplitude proﬁle and intensity (Fig. 6). At detuning zero and for

small values of Rabi frequency, we have some population in excited state. However, when

the intensity of applied pulse increases, the excited state population returns to zero.

In

other words, we are sending shaped pulse into the two-level system but ﬁnally there is no

excited-state population. Curiously enough, for such pulses, the population is asymmetric

9

about detuning from resonance. In fact, Fig. 6 clearly shows that the population transfer

occurs at some non-zero detuning values at higher Rabi frequencies when it does not have

any excitation at resonance and behaves as a dark pulse. This result can be understood

by examining the evolution of the dressed states [17]- [19] with time (Fig. 7). When the

eﬀect of the pulse cannot be felt by the system at very early or and at very late times

with respect to the presence of the pulse, each dressed state essentially corresponds to the

single bare state (
|

α

i → |

i

1

and

β

|

i → |

2

). It is only during the pulse that the dressed
i

states change in composition and evolve as a linear combination of the two bare states.

The proximity of these dressed states during the pulse essentially determines the population

exchange. The higher Rabi frequencies cause a stark shift in the dressed states so that at

resonance there is no population exchange. Under such stark shifted condition, resonance

occurs at some speciﬁc non-zero detuning value where Rabi oscillations are seen in Fig. 6.

These results are completely general for a simple case of a two-level system, where only

an Nth photon transition is possible. The phase change of the overlapping Gaussian pulses

essentially provide an additional parameter to control the population evolution of a simple

two-level type of system that supports only an Nth photon transition.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have explored the eﬀects of ultrafast shaped pulses for two-level systems

that do not have a single photon resonance by developing a multiphoton density-matrix

approach. We took advantage of the fact that dynamics of the intermediate virtual states

are absent in the femtosecond timescales, and demonstrated that many multiphoton results

can be surprising similar to the well-known single photon results. When we extend the

ARP to the multiphoton condition, robust population inversion and dark pulses become

possible that are insensitive to the exact proﬁle of the applied electric ﬁeld. We have shown,

therefore, that it is possible to extend the single photon coherent control ideas to develop

femtosecond multiphoton coherent control.

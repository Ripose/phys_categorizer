We have shown within the quasistatic approximation that the giant ﬂuctuations of local electro-
magnetic ﬁeld in random fractal aggregates of silver nanospheres are strongly correlated with a local
anisotropy factor S which is deﬁned in this paper. The latter is a purely geometrical parameter
which characterizes the deviation of local environment of a given nanosphere in an aggregate from
spherical symmetry. Therefore, it is possible to predict the sites with anomalously large local ﬁelds
in an aggregate without explicitly solving the electromagnetic problem. We have also demonstrated
that the average (over nanospheres) value of S does not depend noticeably on the fractal dimension
D, except when D approaches the trivial limit D = 3. In this case, as one can expect, the average
local environment becomes spherically symmetrical and S approaches zero. This corresponds to the
well-known fact that in trivial aggregates ﬂuctuations of local electromagnetic ﬁelds are much weaker
than in fractal aggregates. Thus, we ﬁnd that, within the quasistatics, the large-scale geometry does
not have a signiﬁcant impact on local electromagnetic responses in nanoaggregates in a wide range
of fractal dimensions. However, this prediction is expected to be not correct in aggregates which
are suﬃciently large for the intermediate- and radiation-zone interaction of individual nanospheres
to become important.

INTRODUCTION

Electromagnetic properties of fractal nanostructures
have continuously attracted attention since the late 1980-
ies due to their rather unusual physical properties and
the possibility of numerous applications, as described
in several reviews of the subject [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Of
special interest are aggregates of metal nanoparticles in
hydrosols and percolation clusters (metal-dielectric com-
posites) which have, in particular, exhibited the eﬀects of
giant enhancement of nonlinear-optical responses [7, 8, 9,
10], inhomogeneous localization of electromagnetic eigen-
modes [11, 12], and optical memory [13, 14, 15, 16, 17].
Theoretical description of the electromagnetic re-
sponses of disordered fractal aggregates has been closely
interconnected with numerical simulations. This is due
to the fact that a fully analytic solution to the problem of
interaction of an electromagnetic ﬁeld with a large ran-
dom fractal aggregate has not been devised. Some ap-
proximate theoretical approaches were based on the ﬁrst
Born [18] and mean-ﬁeld [19] approximations, approxi-
mations based on few-body interaction (binary [20, 21]
or binary-ternary [12] approximations), and various phe-
nomenological scaling laws [8, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. The
ﬁrst Born and the mean-ﬁeld approximations are not,
generally, useful in the spectral regions where excitation
is resonant. While oﬀ-resonant electromagnetic proper-
ties of fractal aggregates are of interest in atmospheric
physics [25, 26, 27], the research in electromagnetics of
metal fractal aggregates is primarily focused on resonant

interactions. The few-body approximations and the scal-
ing laws proved to be very useful for qualitative theoret-
ical description at the early stages of research. However,
increasingly more realistic simulations revealed that these
approaches do not provide quantitative results. Cur-
rently, they are eﬀectively obsolete. A brief overview
of the progression of numerical models used to simulate
electromagnetic responses of fractal aggregates is given
in the next paragraph.

The theoretical and computational description has
been primarily based on a model of an aggregate of
N touching identical spherical nanoparticles.
Each
nanoparticle, and sometimes the aggregate as a whole,
are assumed to be much smaller in size than the ex-
ternal wavelength. (Polydisperse aggregates built from
spheres of diﬀerent size have also been recently ad-
dressed [28, 29, 30].) In order for an aggregate to be con-
sidered fractal, the number of primary spheres, must be
large, typically, >
103. Initially, simulations were based
∼
on the dipole approximation. In this approximation, each
sphere is assigned a dipole moment located at its center.
The spheres then interact with each other and the exter-
nal ﬁeld via dipole radiation ﬁelds as described by 3N
coupled-dipole equations [21].
In the late 1980-ies and
early 1990-ies, numerical solution of dense linear systems
of >
103 equations was a diﬃcult computational task.
∼
Therefore a model of diluted aggregates was adopted and
used, for example, in Refs. [8, 21, 22, 31, 32, 33, 34].
According to this model, an aggregate of N touching
spheres (where N can be very large) is diluted,
i.e.,

−

→

≪

p, where p

spheres were randomly removed from the aggregate with
1. Then the coor-
the probability 1
dinates of the remaining spheres are rescaled according
to r
p1/Dr, where D is the fractal dimension. This
procedure does not change the density-density correla-
tion function of the aggregate in some intermediate re-
gion. However, it does change the local structure of
the aggregate substantially. The few-body approxima-
tions and scaling laws were largely validated with the
model of diluted aggregates. However, when computa-
tions with non-diluted clusters became feasible, it was
found that both the few-body approximations and the
scaling laws are inaccurate [35]. The deviation from the
scaling laws has been explained by the phenomenon of
inhomogeneous localization [3]; however, the theoretical
relation of this phenomena to the aggregate geometry has
not been clariﬁed. Additionally, it has been well known
that account of excitation of higher multipole modes is
important for touching nanoparticles, even when the size
of each nanoparticle is much smaller than the external
wavelength [36, 37, 38, 39]. In particular, the dipole ap-
proximation failed to properly describe experimentally
observed red shifts in extinction spectra of colloid aggre-
gates [35, 40]. To remediate this problem, a phenomeno-
logical model of geometrical renormalization have been
introduced [35, 41] and, recently, computations beyond
the dipole approximation have been performed [42].

The combination of ﬁndings contained in the above-
cited references strongly suggest that the local structure
of aggregates is of primary importance. However, the lo-
cal structure of random fractal nanoaggregates has not
been so far the focus of research. In this paper we, for
the ﬁrst time, point to a strong correlation between the
anisotropy of local environment and enhancement of lo-
cal ﬁeld in fractal aggregates within the quasistatic ap-
proximation. In particular, we ﬁnd that the correlation
coeﬃcient of the local anisotropy factor S (introduced be-
d
2
low) and the value of a local squared dipole moment
|
|
can be as high as 0.75 and tends to grow with the wave-
length. We have found that the average local anisotropy
factor is almost independent of fractal dimension in the
range 1.7 < D < 2.8. Note that this result is expected
to change in large aggregates where intermediate- and
far-zone interaction is important.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section II the
local anisotropy factor is introduced. The dependence of
the local anisotropy factor on the fractal dimension of
aggregates and other parameters for computer-simulated
fractals is discussed in Section III. Section IV contains re-
sults concerning the correlation of local electromagnetic
ﬁelds and the local anisotropy factor. The electromag-
netic calculations in this section were performed with the
method of coupled multipoles [39, 42], e.g., without the
dipole approximation. Finally, Section V contains a sum-
mary of obtained results.

II. DEFINITION OF THE LOCAL
ANISOTROPY FACTOR

The deﬁnition of local anisotropy factor introduced in
this paper is based on an analogy with ellipsoids. An el-
lipsoid is a geometrical object that can exhibit either per-
fect spherical symmetry, or strong anisotropy, depending
on its eccentricity.

Consider a general ellipsoid excited by a linearly polar-
ized monochromatic external wave of amplitude E0. In
the quasistatic limit, the polarization P inside the ellip-
soid is independent of position and can be found from

where the tensor ˆQ is given by

ˆQ =

ˆG0(0, r′)d3r′ .

ZV

Here ˆG0(r, r′) is the regular part of the quasistatic free-
space dyadic Green’s function for the electric ﬁeld. The
integral is taken over the volume of the ellipsoid, V , and
is independent of position. Therefore, it is evaluated at
the center of ellipsoid, r = 0. A unique property of ellip-
soids is that ˆQ is diagonal in the reference frame whose
axes are collinear to the main axes of the ellipsoid. Corre-
spondingly, if E0,α are the Cartesian components of the
external electric ﬁeld in the same reference frame, the
solution to (1) is

Pα =

principal values of ˆQ by

(4)

In the case of spherical symmetry (e = 0), Qα = 0 and
να = 1/3. For an ellipsoid of nonzero eccentricity, the
depolarization factors become diﬀerent from 1/3. Thus,
for example, if e = 1, we have ν1 = ν2 = 0, ν3 = 1
for an oblate ellipsoid (inﬁnitely thin circular disk) or
ν1 = ν2 = 1/2, ν3 = 0 for a prolate ellipsoid (inﬁnitely
thin needle). The anisotropy factor S can be deﬁned as
dispersion of the depolarization factors:

2 .

S2 =

ν2
αi − h

Obviously, this parameter is zero for a sphere and positive
for any ellipsoid of nonzero eccentricity. In particular, for
the inﬁnitely thin needle, S = 1/3√2 and for an inﬁnitely
thin circular disk, S = √2/3. The latter is the maximum
possible value for S given the constraint

(5)

α να = 1.

P

Now we extend the deﬁnition of the depolarization ten-
sor to include particles of arbitrary shape. Namely, for
an arbitrary system occupying some volume V , we deﬁne

ˆν(r) =

ˆI

− ZV

ˆG0(r, r′)d3r′ ,

(6)

where ˆI is the unity tensor.
If V is of general shape,
the result of integration in the right-hand side of (6) is
position-dependent. Therefore, the tensor ˆν(r) depends
on the point r it is evaluated at and is referred to here as
local. Similarly to the case of ellipsoids, this tensor can
be diagonalized. Then we can use the principal values
να(r) to calculate the anisotropy factor according to (5).
In this paper we consider aggregates of (possibly, poly-
disperse) spheres whose centers are located at points ri
and radii are denoted by ai. In this case, the expression
for ˆν(r) is simpliﬁed. We use

ˆG0(r, r′)d3r′ =

Diagonalization of the tensor ˆνi and calculation of

its principal values gives the local
anisotropy factor Si. This parameter quantiﬁes the de-
gree of anisotropy of the local environment of the i-th
sphere.

A few notes about the introduced deﬁnition must be
made. First, the principal value να obtained as described
above are purely geometrical characteristics of an object.
They are related to the Bergman-Milton spectral param-
eters [43] only in the special case of ellipsoidal (more gen-
erally, spheroidal) shape of V . Obtaining the Bergman-
Milton spectral parameters requires diagonalization of
the integral operator W with the kernel G0(r, r′), r, r′
∈
V . This is a much more complicated task than diagonal-
ization of the tensor ˆQ(r) =
V G0(r, r′)d3r′ at a given
point r. In particular, ˆQ(r) is three-dimensional, while
R
W is inﬁnite-dimensional. Correspondingly, the number
of Bergman-Milton parameters is inﬁnite (although only
three of them have non-zero oscillator strengths in the
case of spheroids), while the tensor ˆν(r) has only three

3

P

principal values. Second, the principal values να(r) are
1
να ≤
not constrained, in general, by the conditions 0
α να = 1. This also distinguishes them from the
and
Bergman-Milton spectral parameters. Next, the param-
eter Si depends on the coordinates of all nanoparticles in
= i. However, due to the fast cubic
the aggregate with j
decay of the near-ﬁeld component of the dipole radiation
ﬁeld, the neighbors within few coordinate spheres of the
i-th site give the largest input to Si. This justiﬁes the lo-
cality of Si, as it only weakly depends on the large scale
structure. This statement needs to be qualiﬁed in ag-
gregates large enough so that interaction in the far-zone
becomes important. Even without account of retarda-
tion, the locality of Si can be violated in aggregates with
the fractal dimension close to 3 (or in random non-fractal
composites), due the logarithmic divergence of the inte-
r−3d3r at inﬁnity. We do not expect these eﬀects
gral
to be important in most aggregates of practical interest
with the fractal dimension in the range D < 2.7 and do
not consider them in this paper.

R

Finally, the introduced parameter is not sensitive to
the wavelength and electromagnetic properties of the
scattering material. Therefore, we do not expect it to be
a good indicator of local electromagnetic response at all
wavelengths. It is also independent of the incident polar-
ization. A possible deﬁnition of a polarization-sensitive
anisotropy factor is

III. RESULTS: SIMULATIONS OF
GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES

Since the unique electromagnetic properties of colloid
aggregates are often attributed to their fractal struc-
ture, we have studied computer-generated aggregates
with various fractal dimensions. We have generated
quasi-random oﬀ-lattice aggregates with varying fractal
dimension D using the algorithm described in [42]. This
algorithm simulates the stochastic dynamics of individual
nanoparticles and sub-aggregates in a solution with the
account of random (Brownian) forces, as well as deter-
ministic interparticle (the Van-der-Waals and Coulomb)
and external potentials. Discrete Newtonian mechanics
was implemented with a suﬃciently small time step, such
that the spatial translation of any particle (sphere) at
each step is much smaller than its diameter. Rotation of

6
aggregates was taken into account. We have used both
monodisperse (ai = const) and polydisperse nanospheres
(ai were randomly distributed according to the Poisson
distribution). The fractal dimension of obtained aggre-
gates was tuned in the interval 1.7 < D < 3.0 by varying
the initial density of spheres prior to the aggregation pro-
cess. The numerical value of D was calculated from the
linear regression of the pair density-density correlation
function which, in the intermediate asymptote region,
has the scaling form g(r)

rD−3.

The aggregation was simulated in a cubic volume
with elastically reﬂecting boundaries.

ues of the local anisotropy factor S at some selected sites.

on large scale but have similar local structure.
In
other words, the local environment of each particle
is, on average, the same, independently of D. As D
approaches the critical value D = 3, the local anisotropy
factor quickly drops. This corresponds to the fact that
trivial (non-fractal) aggregates are characterized by
almost isotropic local environment and relatively weak
ﬂuctuations of density. We have also calculated the

Real colloid aggregates are strongly polydisperse. Typ-
ically, they contain particles of sizes ranging from 5nm to
30nm [1, 46]. We have investigated the dependence S(D)
for several ensembles of polydisperse aggregates with dif-
ferent ratios of the maximum and minimum sphere ra-
diuses, amax and amin. We have used a discrete Pois-
son distribution of particle sizes with the number of
samples equal to 11 [the discrete step in particle size
amin)/10]. The dependence of local

It

is interesting to note that

the average local
anisotropy factor does not depend on the distance of a
given site from the center of mass of the aggregate. This
is illustrated in Fig. 4. Here we plot the value of S aver-
aged over all nanospheres within a spherical shell drawn
arond the center of mass of the aggregate as a function
of the shell radius (see ﬁgure captions for more detail).

In Fig. 5, we also plot the fraction of particles in an
aggregate with local anisotropy factor exceeding 60% of
the maximum value for that aggregate as a function of
fractal dimension. It can be seen that in typical aggre-
gates with fractal dimensions of practical interest, only
small fraction of particles is placed in highly anisotropic
environment. In Fig. 6, an example of an aggregate is

It can be seen that the fractal
aggregate contains sites with much higher values of local
anisotropy factor than random gas. As one could expect,
the local anisotropy factors become smaller when the
density of random gas decreases. However, a fractal
aggregate, although has zero asymptotic density in the
limit N
, always retains approximately constant
fraction of sites with relatively high local anisotropy.

IV. COMPARISON OF STRUCTURAL AND
ELECTRODYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF
FRACTAL NANOAGGREGATES

The main idea of this paper is that there is certain
correlation between local structure and local electromag-
netic ﬁelds in fractal nanoaggregates. This assumption
is conﬁrmed by numerical simulations presented in this
Section.

We have computed optical responses of aggregates of
nanospheres using the method of coupled multipoles [39,
42]. Calculations were performed for monodisperse ag-
gregates built of N = 150 silver nanospheres of constant
radius a = 5nm and placed in vacuum. To facilitate con-
vergence with the maximum order of multipoles included,
we have introduced a surface layer of thickness h = 0.05a.
The dielectric constant of the layer was chosen to be the
same as that of the vacuum, ǫ = 1. We have used exper-
imental values of the optical constants of silver [47] with
ﬁnite-size corrections according to [35]. The maximum
order of the VSHs utilized in the results shown below
was L = 8. The convergence was veriﬁed by control cal-
culations with L = 16. We note that much larger values
of L are required for nanospheres in exact contact (h = 0)
and that the number of the coupled-multipole equations
(with complex coeﬃcients) which must be solved to com-
pute the optical responses is equal to N L(L + 2).

the interval 0.49 < rc < 0.54 when λ = 505nm. Note
that the correlation coeﬃcient is expected to increase to-
wards unity in the spectral region λ > 700nm. Also,
even stronger correlation is expected is a polarization-
dependent deﬁnition of the local anisotropy factor is
used, such as (10) or (11). Validating these hypothesis
will be the subject of future work.

V. SUMMARY

In this paper we have investigated the statistical cor-
relation between the local geometrical structure and lo-
cal electromagnetic responses in fractal aggregates of
nanoparticles. We have used a realistic aggregation
model which allows computer generation of quasi ran-
dom aggregates of variable fractal dimension in the in-
terval 1.7 < D < 3.0. Electromagnetic calculations were
carried out using the method of coupled multipoles, i.e.,
beyond the dipole approximation.

We have found that the local anisotropy factor S intro-
duced in Section II is strongly correlated with the local
electromagnetic response. For aggregates built of high-
quality plasmonic materials, the degree of such correla-
tion tends to increase with the wavelength. The correla-
tion coeﬃcient between the squared dipole moment of a
given nanoparticle in an aggregate and a purely geometri-
cal parameter (local anisotropy factor) reaches the value
of
0.75 for λ = 700nm. We expect that this correlation
can become even larger if a properly-deﬁned polarization-
dependent local anisotropy factor is used and at larger
wavelengths.

The introduced parameter S is a universal geometri-

7

cal characteristic which can be used for analyzing vari-
ous complicated aggregates and composites without ex-
plicit solution of the electromagnetic problem. The dis-
covered strong correlation suggests that, at least in ag-
gregates which are small compared to the wavelength,
the large-scale geometry does not play a signiﬁcant role.
Note that in the IR spectral region, subwavelength ag-
gregates can still be built of hundreds or even thou-
sands of nanospheres. The IR spectral region is of spe-
cial interest because of the very low Ohmic losses in sil-
ver and other noble metals. Correspondingly, heteroge-
neous nanostructures are known to exhibit optical res-
onances of very high quality. This, in turn, results in
giant ampliﬁcation of local optical responses. The lat-
ter phenomenon is currently being actively researched in
ordered nanostructures, including self-similar chains of
nanospheres (nanolenses) [48] and long chains of simi-
lar nanoparticles [49]. Rigorous numerical simulations
in random nanoaggregates are still diﬃcult due to the
high computational complexity of the associated electro-
magnetic problem. The introduced parameter S and the
discovered correlation of this parameter with local elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld allows one to make qualitative predic-
tions about the sites where the electromagnetic energy is
localized by very simple means, e.g., without solving the
electromagnetic problem.

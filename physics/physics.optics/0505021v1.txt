Photonic crystal ﬁbers are used in ﬁber ampliﬁers and lasers because of the ﬂexibility in the design
of mode area and dispersion. However, these quantities depend strongly on the wavelength. The
wavelength dependence of gain, nonlinearity and dispersion are investigated here by including the
wavelength dependence explicitly in the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation for photonic crystal ﬁbers
with varying periods and hole sizes. The eﬀect of the wavelength dependence of each parameter is
studied separately as well as combined. The wavelength dependence of the parameters is shown to
create asymmetry to the spectrum and chirp, but to have a moderating eﬀect on pulse broadening.
The eﬀect of including the wavelength dependence of nonlinearity in the simulations is demonstrated
to be the most signiﬁcant compared that of dispersion or gain.

INTRODUCTION

Photonic crystal ﬁbers are a new class of optical ﬁbers
that have a periodic cladding [1, 2]. Light can be con-
ﬁned to the core either by the band gap eﬀect or by total
internal reﬂection by average refractive index diﬀerence.
Photonic crystal ﬁbers have many intriguing character-
istics, for example, they can be endlessly single mode,
have extremely small or large mode areas and still re-
main single mode. Also the dispersion properties of pho-
tonic crystal ﬁbers are very diﬀerent from standard op-
tical ﬁber. The research of photonic crystal ﬁber lasers
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] and ampliﬁers
[17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24] has been intense in the past
few years. The aim has been two-fold. First, the possibil-
ity of obtaining a small mode area has been exploited by
designing high-gain ampliﬁers/lasers where the overlap
between the mode distribution and doped area is maxi-
mized. On the other hand, the possibility of obtaining a
large mode area has been utilized for realizing high-power
ampliﬁers/lasers with low nonlinearity.

Small-mode area photonic crystal ﬁbers generally
have large dispersion and nonlinearity that also depend
strongly on the wavelength [25]. In this paper, we study
the propagation of 200 fs pulses in high-gain small-mode
area photonic crystal ﬁber ampliﬁers. When short pulses
are considered, the spectrum is wide and thus the wave-
length dependence of the diﬀerent parameters has a pro-
found eﬀect on the pulse propagation.

We compare the temporal and spectral widths, time-
bandwidth products, and chirps of the pulses and am-
pliﬁcation properties for diﬀerent ﬁber geometries. We
ﬁnd out that the wavelength dependence of the parame-
ters has a substantial eﬀect on the pulse properties after
it has propagated a short distance in the ﬁber ampli-
ﬁer. The dispersion caused by the wavelength depen-
dence of the nonlinearity counteracts the dispersion of

the ﬁber and thus the pulses do not broaden as much
as it is expected by considering constant parameter val-
ues for dispersion and nonlinearity. On the other hand,
the spectral broadening and chirping become asymmet-
ric when the wavelength dependence of the parameters is
taken into account. Also, the wavelength dependence of
the dispersion parameters and gain is seen to inﬂuence
the pulse quality less, compared to the important eﬀect of
wavelength dependence of nonlinearity, indicating that in
some cases they could be approximated by constant val-
ues when simulating pulse propagation in photonic crys-
tal ﬁbers.

and n2 is the nonlinear-index coeﬃcient n2 = 3 ·

We consider an Erbium-doped ﬁber ampliﬁer. The
gain as a function of wavelength is as in Fig. 1 of Ref. [22]
and it is approximated to be the same for all geome-
tries since it has the least eﬀect on the pulse propagation
characteristics such as pulse broadening. Also, accord-
ing to Ref. [18] the gain dependence on the wavelength is
strongly inﬂuenced by the emission and absorption cross
section rather than by the photonic crystal ﬁber geome-
try.

THE STUDIED FIBER GEOMETRIES AND
PULSE PROPERTIES

We investigate photonic crystal ﬁbers with a triangular
lattice of air holes in the cladding. The core is formed
by a missing hole. We consider geometries with the hole
diameter to period ratios d/P = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6
and periods P = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 µm. The geometries are
those of interest in the research on high-gain eﬃciency
photonic crystal ﬁber ampliﬁers [15, 19, 21, 22]. The
dispersion and nonlinear parameters [see Eqs. (3) and
(4)] are calculated as a function of the wavelength for all
the geometries. They are shown in Fig. 1 for the ﬁber
geometry d/P = 0.3.

The magnitude of the period aﬀects the wavelength
dependence of the βm. Regardless of d/P , for P = 2
µm, the βm are strongly dependent on the wavelength
while for P = 6 µm the wavelength dependence is not as
prominent. The functional form of the βm as a function
of the wavelength is very diﬀerent for the diﬀerent ﬁber
geometries. For example, for P = 2 µm, the value of
β2 in the center of the considered wavelength range is
positive when d/P =0.2, 0.3, and 0.4, but negative when
d/P =0.5 and 0.6, which can aﬀect the pulse propagation
considerably. The nonlinear coeﬃcient γ(λ), however,

(3)

(4)

(5)

has a similar form as a function of wavelength for all
ﬁber geometries. The steepness of γ(λ) increases when
P decreases or d/P increases.

The studied pulse has the length 200 fs, wavelength
1.55 µm, and peak power P0 =0.01 W. The propaga-
tion distance is 10 cm. The time and frequency axis are
divided into 4096 steps in the split-step Fourier-method.
To demonstrate the eﬀect of the wavelength depen-
dence of g(λ), γ(λ), and βm(λ) in Eq. (1), the simula-
tions for all the diﬀerent geometries are performed twice:
with wavelength dependent gain, nonlinearity and dis-
persion parameters and, for comparison, with all these
parameter values constant. The constant parameter val-
ues are determined at λ = 1.55 µm. The simulations for
some of the geometries (d/P = 0.4 and d/P = 0.5) are
repeated keeping the nonlinear parameter and gain wave-
length dependent, but approximating the the dispersion
parameters with constant values. Also, to investigate the
eﬀect of the wavelength dependence of gain, the simula-
tions are repeated with all other parameters constant but
including the wavelength dependence of gain.

COMPARISON BETWEEN SIMULATIONS WITH
CONSTANT AND WAVELENGTH DEPENDENT
GAIN, NONLINEARITY, AND DISPERSION

We compare the simulations made with wavelength de-
pendent and constant gain, nonlinear and dispersion pa-
rameters. After propagating 10 cm in the ﬁber ampliﬁer,
which is a short distance compared to actual ampliﬁer
lengths, there are clear diﬀerences for the two sets simu-
lations. The pulse shape, spectrum, phase, and chirp are
shown in Fig. 2 for one ﬁber geometry. The deﬁnitions
of the phase of the pulse φ and frequency chirp δω are

A(z, T ) = |A(z, T )|eiφ(z,T )

δω = −

∂φ
∂T

.

The chirp is a measure how much the instantaneous fre-
quency changes across the pulse from the central fre-
quency [26]. From Fig. 2 one can see that the self-
steepening of the pulse is larger for the simulation with
constant g, γ, and βm than for wavelength dependent
g(λ), γ(λ), and βm(λ). The spectrum of the pulse is
more asymmetric when the wavelength dependence of
the parameters is taken into account. Also, the chirp
of the simulation with constant parameters is symmetric
whereas the chirp of the one with the wavelength depen-
dent parameters is larger (in absolute magnitude) on the
leading edge of the pulse than on the trailing edge.

To characterize the pulses after the propagation in the
ampliﬁer, we calculate the temporal and spectral widths,
time-bandwidth products, and chirps of the pulses as well

described by the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM)
and denoted by ∆TF W HM . We also calculated the root-
mean square widths of the pulses, but they are not shown
here since there was no additional information compared
to the FWHM widths. The spectral width is calculated
as the full-width at half-maximum ∆ωF W HM . The pulse

and the chirps are shown in Fig. 3 as a function of the
period for the diﬀerent ﬁber geometries. The chirp is
indicated by the lowest value of the chirp [compare to
Fig. 2(d)].

The results for constant and wavelength dependent g,
γ, and βm are diﬀerent. Pulses broaden less when the
wavelength dependence of the parameters is taken into
account, for all ﬁber geometries except d/P = 0.2. This
indicates that the wavelength dependence of the nonlin-
earity counteracts the temporal broadening induced by
the dispersion. As was discussed in Section , the form of
the nonlinearity as a function of the wavelength is simi-
lar for all the ﬁber geometries, only the steepness of γ(λ)
decreases for decreasing d/P , whereas the form of the
dispersion as a function of the wavelength is completely
diﬀerent for all ﬁber geometries. From Fig. 3(a) one can
see that the temporal broadening of the pulses is reduced
for all ﬁber geometries, only for d/P = 0.2 the eﬀect has
vanished, due to the slight steepness of the nonlinearity
curve.

The magnitude of the chirping is not strongly aﬀected
when the wavelength dependence of the parameters is
included, but it shows a clear asymmetry that can be
seen in Figs. 2(c) and 3(d). The chirp magnitudes for the
geometries with P = 2 µm, d/P = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6
and for P = 3 µm, d/P = 0.6, are not shown in Fig. 3(d)
since the chirps are linear across the total length of the
pulse and thus exhibit no relevant minima.

It can be seen from Fig. 3 that the pulses broaden more
when d/P increases or P decreases, because the nonlin-
ear and dispersion parameters increase with increasing
d/P and/or decreasing P . For ﬁber geometries that have
large periods, the d/P has less eﬀect on the pulse broad-
ening, because the dispersion and nonlinearity of large
d/P geometries do not depend strongly on P . The ge-
ometries with small P and d/P are not suitable for short
pulse ampliﬁcation since the broadening of the pulses is
so strong. Also, the chirping lowers the quality of the
pulses and eﬀects dispersion compensation schemes.

and it is shown in Fig. 4. Here the wavelength depen-
dence of the parameters is taken into account. The ﬁbers
with small P and/or large d/P are ampliﬁed less since the
spectrum of the pulses broadens heavily and not all fre-
quency components get ampliﬁed since the Erbium gain
spectrum is so limited. This indicates that the eﬀects of
pulse spectrum broadening have to be taken into account
when high-gain ﬁber ampliﬁers are designed.

The results of two ﬁber geometries (d/P = 0.3, P = 2
µm and d/P = 0.4, P = 2 µm) are not shown in Figs. 3
and 4. These ﬁber geometries have very large third order
dispersion which results in a complicated pulse shape (see
Fig. 5). The behavior of these pulses is completely diﬀer-
ent for the two simulations with constant and wavelength
dependent parameters (compare the blue and red dashed
curves in Fig. 5). Generally, when P is small small, the
parameters β and γ depend strongly on the wavelength,
and they cannot be approximated by constant values.

COMPARISON OF THE IMPACT OF THE
WAVELENGTH DEPENDENCE OF THE
DIFFERENT FIBER PARAMETERS

In order to compare the eﬀect of including the wave-
length dependence of the diﬀerent ﬁber parameters on
the pulse characteristics, we calculated the pulse propa-
gation for the ﬁber geometries d/P = 0.4 and d/P = 0.5
with two new sets of simulations. Firstly, we approxi-
mated the dispersion parameters βm with constant val-
ues, and secondly, we approximated all other parameters,
except gain, with constant values. The time-bandwidth
products are shown in Fig. 6. From Fig. 6(a) one can
see that the results for the simulations where all the pa-
rameters were wavelength dependent (blue squares) and
where dispersion parameters βm were approximated by
constant values (red stars) are very close, compared to
the simulations with all parameters constant (black cir-

cles). This indicates that the wavelength dependence of
the dispersion coeﬃcients βm does not have as signiﬁ-
cant eﬀect to the pulse as the wavelength dependence of
the nonlinearity coeﬃcient. For the ﬁber geometries in
Fig. 6(b) the wavelength dependence of the dispersion
has a larger impact on the pulse characteristics, since
the pulse spectrum for the geometries with larger d/P is
wider.

To determine the eﬀect of the wavelength dependence
of gain, we calculated the pulse propagation when only
the wavelength dependence of gain was taken into ac-
count but all other parameters (βm and γ) were constant.
The time-bandwidth products are shown in Fig. 6. One
can see in Fig. 6(a) that the simulation where the wave-
length dependence of gain is taken into account (green
crosses) does not change the pulse properties in a sig-
niﬁcant amount compared to the simulation where all
the parameters were constant (black circles). Again in
Fig. 6(b) the eﬀect of the wavelength dependence of gain
is more important due to the extensive pulse broaden-
ing. This implies that the wavelength dependence of gain
does not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect to the pulse propagation
except in the case where the spectral broadening of the
pulse is excessive. For the ﬁber geometry with d/P = 0.5
and P = 2 µm, it is very important to include the wave-

CONCLUSIONS

We have studied pulse propagation in high-gain eﬃ-
ciency photonic crystal ﬁber ampliﬁers with varying pe-
riods and hole sizes. We took into account the wavelength
dependence of the ﬁber parameters for dispersion, non-
linearity, and gain. The wavelength dependence of the
ﬁber parameters has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the temporal
and spectral width of the pulse. The pulses were shown
to broaden less for most ﬁber geometries when the wave-
length dependence of the parameters was taken into ac-
count, indicating that the wavelength dependence of the
nonlinearity counteracts the dispersion of the ﬁbers. The
spectral width and chirp showed asymmetry after propa-
gating a short distance in the ﬁber ampliﬁer. This could
aﬀect for example pulse compression or dispersion com-
pensation schemes. Although the changes in the pulse

6

properties shown here were qualitatively small, they are
important since the propagation distance was short com-
pared to actual ampliﬁer lengths. The wavelength de-
pendence of dispersion and gain was shown not to have
as profound eﬀect on the pulse quality as the wavelength
dependence of nonlinearity. However, the wavelength de-
pendence of all ﬁber parameters have to be included in
the simulations when the pulse spectrum broadens heav-
ily.

We present a method for reconstructing the photon num-
ber distribution from the homodyne statistics based on maxi-
mization of the likelihood function derived from the exact sta-
tistical description of a homodyne experiment. This method
incorporates in a natural way the physical constraints on
the reconstructed quantities, and the compensation for the
nonunit detection eﬃciency.

PACS Number(s): 42.50.Ar, 42.50.Dv

An interesting application of the homodyne detection
is the measurement of phase–insensitive properties of op-
tical ﬁelds, dependent on the photon number distribution
[1]. The homodyne technique goes beyond the current
limitations of direct photodetection. First, ultrafast sam-
pling time can be achieved by using the local oscillator
ﬁeld in the form of a short pulse. Secondly, information
on the photon distribution is carried by two relatively
intense ﬁelds, which can be detected with substantially
higher eﬃciency than the signal ﬁeld itself. This fea-
ture has enabled an experimental demonstration of even–
odd oscillations in the photon number distribution of a
squeezed state [2].

In the homodyne scheme, all phase–independent prop-
erties of the measured ﬁeld are contained in the phase–
averaged statistics of diﬀerence counts [3]. The proba-
bility distribution of diﬀerence counts is a linear combi-
nation of diagonal elements of the density matrix in the
Fock basis. This relation can be analytically inverted
[4], which yields an expression for the photon number
distribution as integrals of the homodyne statistics with
the so–called pattern functions [5]. In a real experiment,
however, the homodyne statistics is known only with
some statistical uncertainty, as it is determined from a
ﬁnite number of experimental runs. Application of pat-
tern functions to noisy experimental data can generate
unphysical results, such as negativities in the photon
number distribution. These artifacts become particularly
strong, when compensation for the detector imperfection
is used in the numerical processing of the experimental
data [6].

In this communication we apply the statistical method-
ology of the maximum likelihood estimation [7] to recon-
struct the photon number distribution from the homo-
dyne statistics. This approach incorporates in a natural
way the ﬁnite character of the experimental data sam-
ple, as well as physical constraints on the reconstructed
quantities. Furthermore, compensation for the detector

imperfection is consistently built into the reconstruction
scheme, without generating unphysical artifacts. Com-
pared to the recent application of the least–square inver-
sion method to quantum state reconstruction [8,9], our
algorithm is based directly on the exact statistical anal-
ysis of a homodyne experiment.

We will start with a statistical description of data col-
lected in a homodyne setup. The phase–averaged proba-
bility distribution p(x) of recording a speciﬁc outcome x
is a linear combination of the photon number distribution
ρn:

where η is the detection eﬃciency and Hn(x) denote Her-
mite polynomials. The continuous variable x is divided
into bins of the width ∆x, which we will label with ν.
When bins are suﬃciently small, we may approximate
the probability pν of registering the outcome in a νth bin
by:

pν = p(xν )∆x,

(3)

where xν is the central point of the νth bin.

Repeating the measurement N times yields a frequency

has been found in a νth bin. The probability of obtaining

answer given to this problem by the maximum likelihood

method is that the best estimate for

rameters obtained from an experiment. The search for

tees that the reconstructed probability distribution will
be free from unphysical artifacts.

This maximization problem has to be solved by nu-
merical means. For this purpose we will introduce a cut–
oﬀ parameter K for the photon number. The positivity
constraints for ρn can be satisﬁed by a substitution of
variables: ρn = y2
n. Instead of computing the likelihood
function, it is more convenient to consider its logarithm:

where we have omitted terms independent of yn, and de-
noted Aνn = An(xν )∆x. The condition that the sum of
probabilities ρn is equal to one can be taken into account
using a Lagrange multiplier
. Thus we obtain a set of

that is, the Lagrange multiplier is equal to the total num-

The maximization problem reformulated in this way
can be treated with standard numerical procedures. We
have performed Monte Carlo simulations of the ho-
modyne experiment and applied the downhill simplex
method [10] to reconstruct the photon number distri-
bution via maximization of the likelihood function.
In
Fig. 1 we depict estimation of the photon number distri-
bution for a coherent state and a squeezed vacuum state,
both states with the average photon number equal to
one. We have assumed imperfect detection characterized
by the eﬃciency η = 85%, which has been taken into
account in the reconstruction process by setting appro-
priately coeﬃcients An(xν ) deﬁned in Eq. (2). The sim-
ulated homodyne data are depicted in the top graphs,
and the result of the reconstruction is compared with
theoretical photon number distributions in the bottom
graphs. The even–odd oscillations in the photon num-
ber distribution of the squeezed vacuum state are fully
recovered despite losses in the detection process. Let us
note that the maximum likelihood estimation algorithm
can be applied to incomplete data consisting only of se-
lected histogram bins, provided that they contain enough
information to resolve contributions from diﬀerent Fock
states. This feature may be useful when, for example,
statistics in some bins is corrupted by external noise.

FIG. 1. Monte Carlo simulations for a coherent state (left)
and a squeezed vacuum state (right). The top graphs depict
phase–averaged homodyne statistics obtained from N = 105
runs, superposed on analytical distributions shown with solid
lines. The interval −5 ≤ x ≤ 5 is divided into 100 bins.
The bottom graphs compare the reconstructed photon num-
ber distribution (circles) with analytical values (bars). The
cut–oﬀ parameter is K = 19.

In conclusion, we have presented a method for recon-
structing the photon number distribution from homo-
dyne data via maximization of the likelihood function.
This method has solid methodological background and
has been derived from the exact statistical description of
a homodyne experiment.

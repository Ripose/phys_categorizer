Abstract

Reference [1] claims that matter–free regions of spacetime may support electromagnetic waves
for which the phase velocity 3-vector is oppositely directed to the power ﬂow 3-vector. This
was the deﬁnition of negative refraction adopted in [2]. We here show that this cannot occur in
regions of spacetime for which the electromagnetic energy density is positive.

magnetic ﬁeld tensor may be written in terms of the vector potential via

of the 4-wavevector, (ω, k). We take ω > 0.

Negative refraction is said to occur whenever kj is oppositely signed to T0j.

2 Flat spacetime

Consider a region of spacetime where, with respect to a given coordinate system, the metric
coeﬃcients are approximated by uniform functions. Can such a spacetime region support ‘neg-
ative refraction’ as deﬁned above? Since in the considered region all covariant derivatives may
be replaced by ordinary derivatives, we have from equations (1), (6), (7) and the Lorentz gauge
(Aµ

,µ = 0) that

Using equations (1), (8), (9) and (10) it is straightforward to show that in this case

3 Curved spacetime

Within the geometric optics approximation, the above argument works with covariant deriva-
tives replacing ordinary derivatives, and is thus valid for curved spacetime also. We conclude
that regions of spacetime in which the electromagnetic energy density is positive cannot support
‘negative refraction’.

In ﬂat spacetimes global solutions to Maxwell’s equations exist for which the amplitude C α is covariantly
constant over all spacetime. In curved spacetime it is often possible to construct solutions in which C α varies
slowly - the so–called ‘geometric optics approximation’ ([3], p.71; [4], p.570).

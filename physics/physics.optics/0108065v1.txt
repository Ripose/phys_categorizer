I. INTRODUCTION

Storage of data by means of holography has long been an active ﬁeld of research. Usu-
ally, the storage must be done in coherent light. However, by the application of holographic
stereography, this requirement can be relaxed. A holographic stereogram is created by opti-
cal multiplexing of a ﬁnite number of viewpoints onto diﬀerent regions of a high resolution
recording medium (see ref. [1,2] and references therein). The perspectives(or viewpoints)
are usually displayed on a Liquid Crystal Display(LCD), and then projected onto a small
area of the recording medium. Traditionally the multiplexing have been done in one of two
ways [1,2]; 1)A cylindrical lens is placed behind a LCD, focusing the laser light into a small
slit. This kind of holographic stereogram is usually refered to as a multiplex stereogram.
The cylindrical lens conserve the image plane characteristics in the vertical direction, and
gives rise to a rainbow colored 3D image [1]. Unfortunately, the intensity distribution at
the focal plane of the cylindrical lens usually contains large variations due to diﬀraction.
Unless the recording media has large dynamic range, these intensity variations gives rise to
saturation and loss of information [2]. 2)The alternative is to produce a socalled DeBitetto
stereogram [2,3].
In this case an ordinary diﬀuser is placed right behind the LCD, and
diﬀuses the light in both the horizontal and vertical direction. Since the slit width is of
order 1mm, most of the light from the diﬀuser is scattered outside the slit, giving very long
exposure times. To reduce the exposure times, a ground glass with ﬁnite diﬀusing angle
is applied. Unfortunately, this results in an uneven illuminated 3D image, especially when
the ground glass is close to the holographic ﬁlm. Note also that a ground glass will diﬀuse
the light in the vertical direction as well, thus destroying the image plane characteristics.
The DeBitetto stereogram is therefore not suitable for production of white light viewable
transmission stereograms on thin emulsions. However, the image may be transferred to the
plane of a second ﬁlmplate. Such image plane stereograms can be displayed in white light
with very little color blur [2].

Ideally, the intensity distribution at the emulsion plane should be as rectangular as
possible, it should contain equal contributions from all parts of the LCD(to obtain an even
illuminated 3D image), and all the incoming light should be utilized. Furthermore, if the
stereogram is recorded on a thin silver halide emulsion, the image plane characteristics must
be preserved, to suppress cross-talk images [2]. None of the traditional techniques fulﬁll all
these requirements. Therefore, alternative solutions must be found.

Pseudorandom diﬀusers seems to be a mature solution for both volume data storage and
holographic stereograms [4–6], due to their ability to distribute the light at the focal plane,
without destroying the image plane characteristics. Pseudorandom diﬀusers were introduced
in holographic stereography by Klug et al [2], and independently by Yamaguchi et al [5],
and were shown to increase the image quality of the holographic stereograms.

In this paper we propose two diﬀerent holographic diﬀusers. The ﬁrst type, which we
will simply call a ’holographic diﬀuser’, can be considered as an alternative to the classical
diﬀuser in a DeBitetto stereogram.
It is capable of directing more light into the slit in
the holoprinter, and perhaps also improve the image quality, by providing a more even
illuminated image than that resulting from a ground glass. The second type, which we
will call a ’multiple-point holographic diﬀuser’, can be considered as an alternative to the
cylindrical lens in a multiplex stereograms. We think it is capable of improving the image

quality of multiplex stereograms, without signiﬁcant reduction of the intensity incident on
the recording medium. To conﬁrm the quality of the holographic diﬀusers described above,
we recorded a few holographic stereograms with the setup shown in ﬁg. 6, which will be
described later. This system will be referred to as the holoprinter. We would like to point
out that the diﬀusers should be designed according to standard stereographic projection
relationships, to ensure that the ﬁnal images are free of anamorphic distortions(see e.g. [1–3]
and references therein).

II. HOLOGRAPHIC DIFFUSER

As mentioned in the previous section, application of a ground glass results in loss of light
and uneven illumination of the diﬀerent parts of the 3D image. A solution to this problem
may be holographic diﬀusers. Holographic diﬀusers have been developed for many display
purposes [7]. They are superior to classical diﬀusers in that they can redirect and control up
to 100% of the incoming light. A holographic diﬀuser suitable for holographic stereography
can be created as follows: 1)First a strip diﬀuser is created by covering an isotropic diﬀuser
with a slit. 2)Next a hologram is recorded with this strip diﬀuser as the object. A hologram
recorded in this way will simply be called a holographic dif f user.

To use this holographic diﬀuser in the production of a holographic stereogram, it must be
placed in contact with the LCD screen. As pointed out in the introduction, the purpose of
the LCD is to provide a perspective picture which can be projected onto a small area of the
holographic ﬁlm. By illuminating the LCD(+holographic diﬀuser) with a proper reconstruc-
tion beam, the real image of the strip diﬀuser is projected into the slit of the holoprinter.
We believe that the real image of the slit should match that of the holoprinter since this
ensures that the whole perspective picture is passed through the slit in the holoprinter, and
that maximum amount of light is utilized. If the slit width of the holographic difuser is too
small, we probably get picket fence artifacts(a detailed description of this problem is given
in ref. [2]). If it is too big, some of the perspective picture is cut oﬀ, and there is also some
loss of light.

To produce a holographic diﬀuser using the principles described above, we covered a
diﬀuser(opal diﬀuser) with a 0.5mm slit. This strip diﬀuser was placed slightly away from
focus of a cylindrical lens, see ﬁg. 1. The lens was introduced to increase the amount of light
passing through the strip diﬀuser, without introducing too large speckles. Since the lens was
placed in front of the diﬀuser, its quality was not important. A collimated reference beam
was illuminating the ﬁlm at an angle of ∼ 50◦, and the distance between the diﬀuser and
the holographic ﬁlms was approximately 30cm. With this setup we recorded a hologram
with a 20mW HeNe laser on BB640 thin silver halide emulsions from HRT technologies.
The size of the exposed ﬁlm was 12.7×10cm, and we used a collimated reference beam
which was larger than the ﬁlm(and therefore considered uniform). The ﬁlm was processed
by a procedure similar to that suggested by Belendez et.al. [8], resulting in Silver Halide
Sensitized Gelatin(SHSG). In this way we were able to produce a holographic diﬀuser with
little unwanted scattering and 40% diﬀraction eﬃciency. During reconstruction, the real
image will form a rectangular strip of 0.5mm width. We found that the eﬀective(actual)
size of the diﬀuser was 10×10cm(the holographic ﬁlm was partially screened by the holder).
Since the distance between the original strip diﬀuser and the holographic ﬁlm was 30cm,

3

this results in a convergence angle of approximately ∼ 9.5◦ during reconstruction.

III. MULTIPLE-POINT HOLOGRAPHIC DIFFUSER

In many applications we are interested in conserving the image plane characteristics in
the vertical direction, to be able to display the (thin emulsion) stereogram in white light
[1]. An optical element which does this can also be created by application of holographic
principles. The experimental procedure is illustrated in ﬁg. 2. We recorded a DeBitetto
stereogram of a rectangular ’point’ diﬀuser. The ’point’ was a Edmund Opal diﬀuser of size
1mm×1.2mm. 120 element holograms were recorded on 12.7×10cm BB520 with a 50 mW
532 nm Nd : Y V O4 laser. The BB520 ﬁlm was translated by 0.9mm between each exposure,
equal to the width of the the slit covering the ﬁlmplate. The distance between the ’point’
diﬀuser and the holographic ﬁlm was approximately 30cm. The eﬀective size of the diﬀuser
was found to be 10.8×9cm, which results in a convergence angle of approximately ∼ 8.5◦
during reconstruction. A reference beam illuminated the ﬁlm from above with an angle
∼ 50◦. This reference beam could be considered uniform, since it was much larger than the
rectangular slit in the holoprinter. The BB520-ﬁlm was processed by a procedure similar to
that suggested by Belendez et.al. [8], resulting in Silver Halide Sensitized Gelatin(SHSG).
In this way we were able to produce a diﬀuser with little unwanted scattering and 30%
diﬀraction eﬃciency. When the real image of this multiple element hologram was recon-
structed, the diﬀuse points were reconstructed side by side, thus creating a vertical line, see
ﬁg. 2. We will name this kind of hologram a multiple − point holographic dif f user, since
it acts diﬀerently from the holographic diﬀuser discussed in the previous section, and is sup-
posed to be used during production of a multiplex stereogram. By illuminating the LCD(+
multiple-point holographic diﬀuser), the perspective information on the LCD is projected
onto a line of size ∼ 1.2mm. The line looks continous, since the width of each point(1mm)
is slightly larger than the distance translated between each exposure(0.9mm). This gives
a small overlap between reconstructed ’points’. Unfortunately, we have not conducted any
analysis to see how this overlap inﬂuences the image quality. More research is needed to
ﬁnd out how this as well as the size of the slit inﬂuences the ﬁnal image.

IV. MEASUREMENTS OF THE INTENSITY DISTRIBUTIONS

We have measured the intensity distributions from the two holographic diﬀusers de-
scribed above. The experimental setup used is shown in ﬁg. 3. A detector from Pasco
Scientiﬁc(model 8020) was covered with a small vertical slit of size 10µm. The detector
can be moved(longitudinally) to the proper ’focal’ plane of the diﬀuser by a micrometer
screw. A second micrometer screw was used to move the detector(transversally) across the
intensity distribution in steps of 10µm. The inaccuracy of the translating mechanism is
about 5µm. The same collimating lens was used during recording and reconstruction, and
the collimated reference beam was larger than the exposed ﬁlm(12.7×10cm), and therefore
considered uniform. The detector was placed at the point were the real image was supposed
to be located. In both cases this distance was 30cm(as indicated in the descriptions above).

By translating the detector along the optical axis, we measured the highest possible peak
intensity 30cm from the diﬀusers within an accuracy of ±1cm.

Fig. 4 shows the relative intensity distribution of the holographic diﬀuser. The width
of the distribution is 0.5mm, which is the same as the width of the strip diﬀuser used to
record the holographic diﬀuser. Some light is distributed outside the original boundaries,
which may be caused by diﬀraction from the edge, unwanted scattering, or misalignment
during reconstruction. The intensity variations within the passband is about 0.3. A ma-
jor contributor to the rapid intensity variations is speckle noise introduced by the ground
glass, but the emulsion will also contribute. Note also that the intensity distribution is
not completely symmetric. We believe this is due to a slight misaligment of the slit during

diﬀuser is shown. Note that the measured intensity distribution from the multiple-point
diﬀuser is nearly rectangular. Again, some light is distributed outside the boundaries of the
original ’point’ diﬀuser(width 1.2mm). It is seen that the intensity variations within the
passband is about 0.5. Furthermore, the variations are much more rapid than in ﬁg. 4.
This is believed to be due to the fact that we used diﬀerent emulsions(BB520 and BB640),
although this has not been completely clariﬁed.

V. SETUP FOR RECORDING HOLOGRAPHIC STEREOGRAMS

To conﬁrm the quality of the holographic diﬀusers described above, we recorded a few
holographic stereograms with the setup shown in ﬁg. 6. The laser is a 20mW 632nm HeNe
laser or a 50mW 532nm Nd : Y V O4-laser. The reference and object beams are separated
by a beamsplitter, and then transported to diﬀerent levels. The object beam is cleaned and
expanded by a spatial ﬁlter, after which it illuminates the LCD. The LCD is placed in close
contact with the diﬀuser, which directs the light into the slit of the printer. The reference
beam is also cleaned and expanded, and then directed towards the slit in the printer. Each
perspective picture on the LCD is exposed onto a strip of the holographic ﬁlm, one by
one.
In total, a holographic stereogram is generated. We applied both the holographic
and multiple-point diﬀusers in front of the LCD, with good results. We hope to publish a
more detailed evaluation of the holographic stereograms produced with this holoprinter in
a separate paper.

In conclusion, we have described two diﬀerent diﬀusers which may be of interest in
holographic stereography. We have performed some simple measurements to get a better
picture of the performance of these diﬀusers. However, many questions are still not answered,
and should be the subject of future investigations. In particular it would be interesting to see
the inﬂuence of diﬀerent numerical apertures, the reference beam angle, the polarization of
the incident beam, and the size of the slit. Also the inﬂuence of overlap in the multiple-point
diﬀuser should be studied in more detail.

This work was done while L. E. Helseth was at the University of Bergen.

We obtain gain of the probe ﬁeld at multiple frequencies in a closed three-level V-type system
using frequency modulated (FM) pump ﬁeld. There is no associated population inversion among
the atomic states of the probe transition. We describe both the steady-state and transient dynamics
of this system. Under suitable conditions, the system exhibits large gain simultaneously at series of
frequencies far removed from resonance. Moreover, the system can be tailored to exhibit multiple
frequency regimes where the probe experiences anomalous dispersion accompanied by negligible
gain-absorption over a large bandwidth, a desirable feature for obtaining superluminal propagation
of pulses with negligible distortion.

I. INTRODUCTION

In the last decade, a lot of remarkable eﬀects of atomic coherence have been observed in various multilevel atoms [1].
One of these eﬀects is lasing without inversion (LWI) [2] which has prospects in short-wavelength lasing. Conventional
lasers based on population inversion become impractical in these wavelength regimes due to the ω3 dependence of the
Einstein A coeﬃcient. Several experiments have provided unequivocal evidence of LWI; starting from ampliﬁcation
without inversion in transient [3] then in the steady state regime [4], leading ultimately to LWI [5]. In the LWI schemes
an external driving ﬁeld along a nearby transition generates atomic coherence which contributes to gain and alleviates
the population inversion condition. In this paper we show another signiﬁcant contribution that becomes operative in
presence of strong modulation and results in gain at multiple frequencies. The conventional LWI based laser systems
suﬀer from a major limitation due to the small gain they exhibit in comparison to the population inversion based laser
systems. However, this diﬃculty is largely overcome in this FM ﬁeld driven system because under suitable conditions
one can obtain gain enhancement of (∼ 103%) with respect to the conventional LWI schemes (monochromatic ﬁeld
driven systems).

The FM ﬁeld interacting with a two-level system has been intensely studied earlier [6–10] and more recently [11–15].
The FM pump ﬁeld produces a large number of sidebands [13] which lead to periodic modulation of the absorption
coeﬃcient and the ﬂuorescence signal [10]. Analytical solutions have been obtained for the weak modulation case
in [8]. The periodic FM ﬁeld forms the basis of ultrasensitive absorption spectroscopy [9,11] where the resonant
information is made to ride on the modulation frequency or its harmonics thus overcoming the predominantly low
frequency noise of lasers. The FM ﬁeld provides many independent parameters which can be sensitively controlled
and thus result in novel eﬀects like the trapping of population [15], in multilevel systems suppression of a series of
resonances occurs in the Autler-Townes spectra [16]. The trapping phenomenon due to the periodic FM ﬁeld [17] or
amplitude dependent phase modulation [20] can be exploited to achieve robust transfer of population across multiple
levels. The systems driven by amplitude modulated ﬁeld have also been widely studied: the two-level system [18] and
the three-level system [19] both exhibit multiple resonances resulting from the modulation. We exploit the multiple
resonances generated by the FM ﬁeld and then tailor various parameters to obtain the desired gain features. To our
knowledge studies have not been undertaken to obtain gain in multilevel systems using FM ﬁelds, particularly in the
strong modulation regime, we undertake this study in this paper.

The organization of the paper is as follows: in section II we obtain the density matrix equations that govern the
dynamics of the V-type system pumped by a FM ﬁeld on one transition and is probed by a monochromatic ﬁeld on
the neighboring transition. We present the analysis of the results in section III, where we begin with the description
of the steady state response of the system and go on to discuss the transient dynamics and ﬁnally discuss the physical
basis of the gain obtained. In the steady state analysis we ﬁrst deal with the oﬀ-resonant case where the central
frequency of the FM ﬁeld is detuned from atomic resonance followed by the on-resonance case. The contribution of
atomic coherence between the two excited states of the V-type system is known to be responsible for inversionless
probe gain in systems pumped by a monochromatic ﬁeld [21,22]. Here, we describe another contribution which comes
into being purely due to the modulation and plays a critical role in obtaining gain. We also describe the Floquet
analysis which sheds light on the striking change that occurs in the probe spectrum at speciﬁc values of the index

1

of modulation. We utilize some of these features to obtain anomalous dispersion for the probe ﬁeld accompanied by
negligible absorption-gain in any desired frequency regime. This is an attractive feature for obtaining distortion free
superluminal propagation [23]. Next, we describe the transient dynamics and try to identify the dominant nonlinear
processes involved. The intricate dynamics of the time evolution is presented. We describe in detail the physical
mechanism which is based on spontaneous emission assisted nonlinear optical process that we believe dominates the
gain process. We present our conclusions in section IV.

We consider a closed three-level V-type system (Fig. 1) wherein, one of the transitions is coupled to a FM pump
ﬁeld and the other transition is coupled to a probe ﬁeld as well as an incoherent (broadband) pump. The ﬁeld at the
atom is given as

II. MODEL AND CALCULATION

E = E1e

−i[ω1t+Φ(t)] + E2e

−iω2t + c.c.;

Φ(t) = M sin (Ωt),

where E1 (E2) is the amplitude of the pump (probe) ﬁeld, the FM ﬁeld is sinusoidally modulated about the central
frequency ω1 and the modulation is characterized by two independent parameters - the frequency of modulation Ω
and the index of modulation M . The FM ﬁeld couples the |1i ↔ |3i transition and the monochromatic probe ﬁeld at
ω2 couples the |2i ↔ |3i transition.

The total Hamiltonian of the system is

H = ¯hω13|1ih1| + ¯hω23|2ih2| − d · E,

where, d = d13|1ih3| + d23|2ih3| + c.c. The ﬁrst two terms in the Hamiltonian correspond to the unperturbed atomic
system where the energies are measured from the ground state |3i, and the last term is the interaction term in the
dipole approximation. The semi-classical density matrix equation is

− Λ(|3ih3|ρ − 2ρ33|2ih2| + ρ|3ih3|),

(3)

where, 2γ1(2γ2) is the rate of spontaneous emission from the level |1i(|2i) to |3i, 2Λ is the rate of incoherent pumping
on the |2i ↔ |3i transition.

We transform the equation of motion (3) into a frame rotating with the instantaneous frequency of the ﬁeld by

using the following relations

and undertake the rotating-wave approximation by neglecting the counter-rotating terms at nearly twice the optical
frequency, like e±2i[ω1t+Φ(t)] and e±2iω2t. This approximation is valid if |dΦ(t)/dt| ≪ ω1 which is valid for typical
frequency modulation in the optical regime. Due to the coupling to the FM ﬁeld the slowly varying density matrix
(˜ρ) equations involve time-dependent detuning factors which go as dΦ(t)/dt.

We intend to obtain exact solutions of the density matrix equation for arbitrary strength of the ﬁelds and arbitrary

values of the index of modulation. For this purpose we use the Fourier decomposition

which involves integral multiples of the frequency of modulation Ω.

On substituting the expression (4) in the equation of evolutions of the slowly varying density matrix (˜ρij ) and
equating various powers of Ω, we obtain the following inﬁnite set of equations where n is an integer that varies from
−∞ to ∞. The equations that govern the dynamics of the system are

where ∆1 = ω13 − ω1 is the detuning of the central frequency of the FM ﬁeld from the atomic resonance on the
|1i ↔ |3i transition, the probe ﬁeld detuning is ∆2 = ω23 − ω2 on the |2i ↔ |3i transition. The strength of the
atom-ﬁeld coupling is given by the Rabi frequency 2Gi = 2di3 · Ei/¯h on the |ii ↔ |3i transition, for i = 1 and 2
denoting the pump and probe Rabi frequencies, respectively. The six equations in Eqs. (5) and three equations of
motion for ρ(n)
32 form a set of nine equations for each n. We note that the set of equations for n are
coupled to set for n ± 1. The closure of the above system requires that ρ(n)

We obtain exact non-perturbative solutions of the above equations in both the transient as well as steady-state
regimes. The transient solutions are obtained by taking a large set of closed (2N +1)×9 ﬁrst order coupled diﬀerential
equations where the harmonic index n varies from −N to N , and numerically integrating them using fourth-order
Runge-Kutta routine. Needless to say, we have checked the convergence of the solutions by increasing N and decreasing
the step-size of integration. We obtain the steady-state solutions by setting the left hand side time derivatives to
zero in Eqs. (5) and obtain tri-diagonal recurrence relations which are solved using the inﬁnite continued fraction
technique [24,10].

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Steady-state response

We present the steady-state response of the system described in section II. We consider two diﬀerent cases, ﬁrst one
is the oﬀ-resonant case wherein the central frequency of the FM ﬁeld is detuned from the atomic transition (∆1 6= 0),
and the second case where the central frequency of the FM ﬁeld is on resonance with the atomic transition. The
second case permits a comparison with the usual system pumped by a monochromatic ﬁeld instead of the FM ﬁeld
[21]. In all our calculations the relevant frequency/time variables are appropriately normalized with the spontaneous
emission decay on the pump transition, namely γ1.

In presence of the FM ﬁeld on |1i ↔ |3i transition, the probe ﬁeld on the |3i ↔ |2i transition exhibits two combs
of absorption peaks which are slightly displaced from each other. Each comb has frequencies that are separated by
∼ ±Ω and the relative shift between the combs depends on M , ∆1 and G1. The overall spectrum appears as a series of
double peak structures displaced by ∼ ±Ω. The width of the resonances depend on the incoherent processes like the
decays and the incoherent pump. Fig. 2a shows a typical absorption spectrum of the probe ﬁeld modiﬁed by a strong
FM ﬁeld on the neighboring transition. In our notation, absorption of the probe ﬁeld occurs when Im(ρ(0)
32 ) < 0. The
two displaced comb like resonances result from probing the two linearly independent set of Floquet states resulting
from the time periodic nature of the FM ﬁeld-atom interaction. We discuss these aspects in detail below.

In presence of the incoherent pump Λ one comb of frequencies experiences gain ( Im(ρ(0)

32 ) > 0 corresponds to probe
gain). The two set of combs continue to remain displaced and one of them is ﬂipped over in the opposite direction
exhibiting gain as seen in Fig. 2b.

In terms of the density matrix equations the steady state contributions to the probe gain/absorption can be resolved

into three diﬀerent terms, namely,

F1 =

i G2 (ρ(0)

22 − ρ(0)

32 = F1 + F2 + F3.

The ﬁrst term F1 contains the contribution of the population diﬀerence between the energy levels |2i and |3i (when
M = 0 it corresponds to the conventional population inversion term), the next two terms correspond to the coherence
term in the conventional modulation free (M = 0) scheme [21,22]. Note that all the three components have the same
denominator. The second term F2 provides the probe response to the dynamics at the central FM frequency ω1, or,
to the n = 0 contribution on the |1i ↔ |3i transition. The third term F3, we call the modulation term, provides
the contributions arising purely due to modulation. The contributions from the higher order terms, namely |n| ≥ 1,
are mainly channeled through the F3 term. Note that the F3 term provides the coupling of n = 0 response to the
n = ±1 term and this coupling is proportional to G1M Ω, moreover, the coupling is independent of the probe Rabi
frequency G2. Similar expressions can be written for each n and the coupling from higher order terms n ± 1 always
occurs through G1M Ω and is independent of G2. No approximations are made in writing out the various components
in Eq. (6), all the individual factors contained therein, like ρ(0)
, are calculated exactly and thus
contain all the higher order contributions.

The major contribution from the ﬁrst two terms (F1 and F2) for a weak probe occur at frequencies

which is similar to the usual monochromatic pump case. The third term F3 provides the higher order contributions
which become signiﬁcant in presence of strong modulation due to the coupling proportional to G1M Ω, as seen in Eq.
(6). For the parameters chosen for Fig. 2, the contribution from the F3 term dwarfs the F1 and F2 contributions at all
the frequencies other than those given in Eq. (7), see Fig. 2c. Thus, in the strong modulation regime the modulation
term dominates over the population inversion and the coherence terms of the usual monochromatic pump case.

In order to understand the two comb of resonances one can obtain the Floquet spectrum resulting from the FM
ﬁeld coupling the atomic transition. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that in presence of strong modulation and
under certain conditions the Autler-Townes response exhibits simultaneous suppression of semi-inﬁnite number of
resonances [16]. The conditions under which this occurs can also be obtained by analyzing the Floquet-spectrum.
Following the approach developed by Shirley [25] to obtain the Floquet states, we consider exactly the eﬀect of the
strong FM ﬁeld on the atomic transition and neglect the weak eﬀects of dissipation and the weak probe ﬁeld because
G1, Ω ≫ γ1, γ2, Λ, G2. In this limit it is advantageous to look at the dressed states |Ψ1i and |Ψ3i (dressed by the FM
ﬁeld) instead of the bare atomic states |1i and |3i. The Schr¨odinger equation of the evolution of the corresponding
dressed state amplitudes ψ1 and ψ3 is

Here, we have ordered the elements of the Floquet Hamiltonian Hf such that i runs over the states 1 and 3 before a
change in the harmonic index n which takes integer values from −∞ to ∞. The eigenvalues of the Hf matrix are the
quasienergies associated with various levels of the dressed states. The structure of the matrix (11) results in periodic
eigenvalues, and each dressed state has an inﬁnite ladder of quasienergy levels separated by ±Ω. In other words the
comb of resonances correspond to probing the two linearly independent set of dressed states + and −, whose energies
given by λ± + nΩ, where n takes integer values from −∞ to ∞. Moreover, two levels belonging to diﬀerent dressed
states complement each other, i.e., λ+ − λ− = ∆1 modulo(Ω).

It has been shown in detail [16] that when

λ + mΩ = 0

for some integer m the determinant of the characteristic equation of the above eigenvalue problem factorizes into
determinants of two semi-inﬁnite blocks

det[Hf − Iλ]λ=−mΩ = − G2

1 det[Ha − Iλ] det[Hb − Iλ] = 0.

The two semi-inﬁnite blocks are such that the harmonic index n in Ha and Hb runs from −∞ to m − 1 and m + 1
to ∞, respectively. The quasienergies are ambiguous within integer multiple of Ω because replacing λ by λ + kΩ,
where k is an integer, leaves the Eq. (13) unchanged. The above factorization results from the structure of the
Floquet Hamiltonian - if the integer m happens to be n in matrix (11) then the row and column marked by small
horizontal and vertical arrows, respectively, in the matrix Eq. (11) contains only one non-trivial element namely
−G1, corresponding to the χm
3 = 0 then the half-inﬁnite system of equations is closed resulting in
the above factorization, eq. (13). To determine bounded non-trivial solutions of the characteristic equation (13) one
requires that one of the following conditions is satisﬁed, either

3 term. Now if χm

The above conditions results in

det[Ha + I mΩ] = 0 or det[Hb + I mΩ] = 0.

1 = χn
χn

3 = 0 for all n < m or

n > m

depending on which of the conditions in Eq. (14) is satisﬁed. The various harmonics of the dressed states χn
i and the
corresponding quasienergies λ are determined numerically with the dimensions of the Floquet Hamiltonian matrix to
be 2(N + 1) where N is a large positive integer and the harmonic index n in eq. (11) varies from −N to N .

We calculate the variation of the quasienergies as a function of the modulation index M for a ﬁxed value of the
pump ﬁeld coupling strength, its detuning and the modulation frequency. In Fig. 3a the corresponding parameters
are G1 = 20γ1, ∆1 = 20γ1, and Ω = 30γ1. Henceforth, we drop the harmonic superscript (0) from the density matrix
variables as we will deal with only the zeroth order atomic response at the frequencies ω1 and ω2 unless otherwise
speciﬁed. As seen in Fig. 3a, the quasienergy level plotted with a solid line crosses the zero energy periodically at
M = 2.915, 4.06, 6.26, 7.35 and so on. At these values of M the condition (12) is satisﬁed. The probe spectrum
exhibits only one set of absorption peaks separated by Ω, instead of the usual set of double peaks, as Eq. (15) is
satisﬁed. Fig. 3b highlights this feature for M = 2.915 which is the ﬁrst zero crossing of the quasienergy level in Fig.
3a. There is only single peaked structure for ∆2 > 0, whereas the spectra for ∆2 < 0 continues to exhibit the two set of
peaks. In Fig. 3b the probe response is shown for various values of the incoherent pump Λ/γ1 = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and
1.0. In the absence of the incoherent pump the probe absorption spectra for ∆2 < 0 contains two comb of absorption
dips, whereas for ∆2 > 0 it contains a single comb of absorption dips separated by ∼ Ω. As the incoherent pump
rate is increased one set of absorption dips transform into gain peaks. The gain is maximum at about Λ/γ1 = 0.5.
We have observed that for parameters where the semi-inﬁnite resonances are suppressed, the surviving single comb
of resonances almost always exhibit gain in presence of the incoherent pump.

As the probe spectrum shows well separated gain peaks (for ∆2 > 0) the intermediate region accords the possibility
of anomalous dispersion. In these frequency regimes the probe beam can experience superluminal velocity due to

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

anomalous dispersion [23]. Regions of anomalous dispersion (d Re(ρ32)/dω2 < 0) accompanied by a ﬂat region of
nearly zero absorption (Im(ρ32) ≈ 0) is particularly desirable in achieving superluminal propagation. In Fig. 4, the
region between a set of gain peaks is expanded and one can see the anomalous dispersion accompanied by a ﬂat region
of negligible gain/absorption. The superluminal propagation in Ref. [23] is achieved in between Raman gain lines. The
anomalous region between the gain lines, in their system, is quite limited in terms of the available bandwidth for the
probe pulse. This is because the two ﬁelds responsible for the Raman gain cannot be too far detuned from resonance.
The trade oﬀ between achieving suﬃciently large gain so as to obtain sharp change in dispersion in between the gain
lines, and having the gain lines separated far enough so as to obtain minimal gain at the line center severely restricts
the bandwidth in their system. Moreover, Doppler broadening further reduces the desirable anomalous region. In
most other schemes too one lacks the control over the separation between closely spaced doublet exhibiting inversion,
as the doublets arise from either hyperﬁne splitting or isotope shift [26]. This limitation is overcome in our system
because the bandwidth depends on the frequency of modulation and one can achieve a few hundred GHz modulation
frequency at optical frequencies. Another advantage of this system is availability of multiple periodically separated
gain peaks so that one could choose to operate the probe far oﬀ resonance and thus the possibility of decreasing
the noise arising from spontaneous emission [27]. Hence, our system in principle accords more ﬂexibility in obtaining
anomalous dispersion region of desired frequency bandwidth in a desired frequency regime. The possibility of tailoring
dispersion/absorption-gain characteristics by controlling diﬀerent parameters of the modulation and the incoherent
pump to overcome restrictions due to Doppler broadening and power broadening are added advantages of this system.
We now discuss in detail the resonant case where the central frequency of the FM ﬁeld is on resonance with the
|1i ↔ |3i transition and contrast our results with the traditional monochromatic (M = 0) case. In the monochromatic
pump case, gain arises purely from the coherence between the excited states |1i and |2i which are not dipole connected,
and, has been shown to occur without inversion in any state basis [21]. We calculate the steady-state response of the
system in presence of modulation and Fig. 5a depicts the gain obtained as a function of the index of modulation M .
At M = 0 one obtains the gain typical of the monochromatic case, whereas for strong modulation (M away from
zero) one ﬁnds much larger gain. The Im(ρ32) at M = 10.17 is 3.75 × 10−5 in comparison to 3.05 × 10−6 at M = 0, a
∼ 103% increment over the monochromatic case. It should be borne in mind that the dynamics in presence of strong
modulation is such that signiﬁcant contributions occur from the numerous side-band resonances leading to such large
gain.

The absorption peaks (sharp dips in Fig. 5a) occur at those values of M for which Jo(M ) = 0, note that we have
chosen Ω >> γ1. This eﬀect is expected on physical grounds as one can see from the spectral content of the FM ﬁeld,
namely

eiM sin(Ωt) =

Jp(M )eipΩt,

+∞

Xp=−∞

(16)

where Jp(M ) is the Bessel function of integer order p. Whenever the resonant central frequency is absent on the
|1i ↔ |3i transition the population in level |3i dominantly experiences absorption on the |3i ↔ |2i transition, and the
large value of Ω also ensures that spectral components at ±Ω with the weight of J±1(M ) are far removed in frequency
from the resonant line center. In between these peaks of absorption one obtains gain. The fact that one obtains gain
only when J0(M ) 6= 0 points toward the spontaneous emission assisted nonlinear optical process responsible for gain
which will be discussed in detail at the end of this section.

In terms of the density matrix the major contribution to the gain is from the modulation term F3 of Eq. (6) as
seen in Fig. 5b. For M = 0 the contribution from the inversion term F1 is negative while the positive coherence
term F2 completely oﬀsets this and is responsible for gain. The F3 term is zero at M = 0 and starts increasing as M
gets larger. For strong modulation the F3 term largely overshadows all other contributions and is responsible for gain
in between the zeros of J0(M ). The smaller dips in the F3 component, that occur in between the the zeros of the
J0(M ), result from the next higher contribution arising from ω1 ± Ω. These set of dips that occur when F3 is large
and positive are due to the zeros of the the Bessel J1(M ). The weights of the contribution at ω1 ± Ω are J±1(M ),
these contributions are absent when M takes values such that J1(M ) = 0. It should be noted that even though the
contribution from ±Ω disappears at these values of M , the contribution from higher multiples of Ω continues to be
signiﬁcant resulting in large F3 term and the resulting gain. The steady state population distribution is shown in Fig.
5c. At M = 0, ρ22 < ρ11 < ρ33 and this results in gain without inversion in the bare state basis as well as no inversion
for the Raman process. For M = 3.7 where the gain is 1.6 × 10−5 about ∼ 400% more than the monochromatic case,
the relative population distribution is the same, i.e., ρ22 < ρ11 < ρ33; there is no inversion in the bare state basis
as well as no inversion for the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) process. The two photon SRS inversion condition
requires that ρ22 > ρ11. For very large values of M , not shown in ﬁgure, even though there is no inversion in the bare
state basis (ρ22 < ρ33) there is Raman inversion for the SRS process namely the |2i → |3i → |1i process, because ρ22

6

becomes larger than ρ11. Note that in all our discussions the feature of the gain being inversionless is between the
bare atomic states |1i, |2i and |3i.

B. Transient dynamics

We discuss the time evolution of atomic polarization and population distribution in the FM ﬁeld pumped V-type
system and how it approaches the steady state values. Due to the presence of a strong FM ﬁeld the transient response
of the system is very complex making it diﬃcult to identify the physical mechanism responsible for gain. We consider
in detail one case in which one can identify the dominant process and is comparable to the monochromatic pump
case. We will also present a general case wherein the dynamics is more complex.

We choose the on-resonance case where ∆1 = ∆2 = 0, the modulation frequency is large (Ω = 80γ1) and the index
of modulation is chosen such that it is a zero of the ﬁrst order Bessel function, i.e., J1(M ) = 0 for M = 10.1734. This
particular choice is such that the FM ﬁeld spectrum has the central peak at ω1 with weight J0(M ), no peak at ω1 ± Ω
as J1(M ) = 0, the next peak in frequency is far removed and is at ω1 ± 2Ω with weight J2(M ), and other peaks at
ω1 ± nΩ with n > 2 and weight Jn(M ) are further removed from resonance. Choice of large Ω and the appropriate
M ensures that the eﬀects of ω1 ± nΩ for n 6= 0 are minimal and the population and atomic polarization dynamics
appear to be somewhat similar to the monochromatic pump case.

In Fig. 6a we show the evolution of the population in presence of the incoherent pump with the initial condition
It is seen that at all times ρ22 < ρ33 and ρ22 < ρ11, therefore, there
ρ33 = 1 and all other ρij = 0 (i, j=1-3).
is no population inversion in the bare state basis and there is no Raman inversion for gain through SRS process,
respectively. Fig. 6b shows the evolution of population in absence of the incoherent pump. The population in level
|2i is negligible because the probability of the population to be excited to level |2i is very small as G2 << G1 and
γi. As expected the population oscillates between level |1i and |3i and in steady state ρ11 ≈ ρ33 ≈ 0.5, though ρ33 is
slightly larger than ρ11 due to the presence of the FM ﬁeld and the decays. It is also observed that in presence of the
incoherent pump the population and the atomic coherences reach their steady state values earlier in time. Fig. 6c(d)
shows the evolution of gain-absorption for the probe ﬁeld (FM pump ﬁeld at ω1) with and without the incoherent
pump. We note the following: they both oscillate dominantly with the same frequency and nearly in phase with each
other. Both the probe and the pump ﬁeld experience gain in the transient regime with or without the incoherent
pump. In presence of the incoherent pump only the probe ﬁeld experiences gain in the steady state, whereas with
Λ = 0 both the ﬁelds experience absorption in the steady state.

The probe ﬁeld experiences gain just after ρ33 reaches a minimum value favoring the stimulation process from
|2i → |3i rather than the |3i → |2i transition. The probe ﬁeld experiences gain in the interval when dρ33/dt > 0
and reaches its maximum value at a time when dρ33/dt is the steepest. The FM pump ﬁeld at the ω1 frequency
experiences gain just after ρ11 reaches its maximum value. The contribution to the envelop of the pump gain does
not seem to come from SRS process even though the two-photon inversion with ρ11 > ρ22 is present. The signature
for an SRS process would be that the absorption-gain response on the |1i ↔ |3i and |2i ↔ |3i transitions be out of
phase. In other words, emission on one transition accompanied by absorption on the other transition. This is however
not present in this case as the envelops oscillate in phase with each other as seen in Figs. 6c and d. We re-emphasize
that the gain in the above parameter regime is qualitatively akin to the monochromatic case apart from the rapid but
weak (small amplitude) oscillations due to the FM ﬁeld on the central pump frequency ω1 in Fig. 6d.

We present in Fig. 7 the temporal evolution of the atomic polarization and the population dynamics when the
central frequency of the FM ﬁeld is detuned from the atomic resonance. The parameters chosen are identical to that
in Fig. 2 which corresponds to the steady state behavior. The population initially is in level |3i. The probe frequency
is tuned to the gain peak at ∆2 = 46.8γ1. We observe that the population in levels |1i and |3i oscillate ∼ 180o out of
phase with respect to each other. The population in |2i is negligible in absence of the incoherent pump and steadily
increases in presence of the incoherent pump, see Figs. 7a-b. At time τ γ1 ≈ 3 the population ρ22 becomes larger
than the population ρ11, however, ρ22 remains smaller than ρ33 at all times. Again there is no population inversion
between the levels |2i and |3i. After time τ γ1 ≈ 3, unlike the resonant case shown in Fig. 6, the population ρ22 > ρ11
implying inversion for the SRS process for probe gain.

Both the probe and the pump ﬁelds experience gain in the transient region with or without the incoherent pump.
It is clear that gain on the central FM frequency ω1 results just after ρ11 reaches its maximum value. Apart from
the high frequency oscillations the envelop of the polarization on the central FM frequency ω1 closely follows the ρ11
oscillations. These high frequency oscillations riding on the envelop result from higher order contributions of ﬁeld at
ω1 ± nΩ for n > 0. There is no gain in the steady state at the ω1 frequency, whereas the probe ﬁeld experiences gain
in the steady state.

The frequency of oscillation of the probe ﬁeld depends on its generalized Rabi frequency and is found to be

7

independent of the incoherent decays and the incoherent pump. A closer look at the probe oscillations in Fig. 7c
shows that periodically there are larger peaks of gain which invariably follow just after ρ33 reaches a minimum value,
pointing to similar process discussed above. Moreover, due to the complexity of the time evolution one cannot rule
out SRS process as some peaks of probe gain do match with pump absorption dips and vice-versa.

C. Physical mechanism for gain

Although the quantitative results obtained above from solving the density matrix equations provide complete
description of the system under consideration, it still does not provide insight into the underlying nonlinear optical
processes. Deeper understanding can be obtained by systematically summing up individual scattering processes
and identifying the dominant contributions to the gain. We have observed that in the steady state the probe gain
occurs only if γ1 > γ2 [28], implying that spontaneous emission plays a crucial role in obtaining inversionless gain
[29]. In recent times irreversible spontaneous emission assisted nonlinear optical processes have been suggested which
contribute to inversionless gain (in ladder-type systems by Sellin et al [30] and in Λ-type systems by Zhu [31]). Along
these lines the physical picture for inversionless gain in the steady state for the V-type system would be the following.
First a stimulated emission process from |2i → |3i of the probe photon ω2, followed by absorption from |3i → |1i
and ﬁnally spontaneous emission from |1i → |3i at the rate of 2γ1, see Fig. 8a. Note that the probe experiences
signiﬁcant stimulated emission only at certain frequencies due to the FM pump ﬁeld, namely ω2 ± nΩ. These resonant
features are absent in the conventional LWI schemes. It should also be noted that in the above process the second
step involving absorption from |3i → |1i depends critically on the availability of the ω1 photon (for ∆1 = 0). In its
absence, when the index of modulation M is such that J0(M ) = 0, this nonlinear process is suppressed and the probe
experiences only absorption, see Fig. 5a. The competing process (Fig. 8b), of stimulated emission from |1i → |3i
followed by absorption from |3i → |2i and spontaneous emission from |2i → |3i at 2γ2 rate, is less preferred because
of γ1 > γ2. Thus the former process plays a dominant role in inversionless probe gain.

We have described above the nonlinear optical process responsible for gain when the central FM frequency ω1 is
resonant with the atomic transition. We have also looked at detuned cases and similar nonlinear process seems to
form the basis for obtaining gain. We describe brieﬂy one such detuned case, wherein ∆1 is ﬁnite and Ω is chosen to
be equal to ∆1. It is clear that, in this case, the ω1 + Ω photon would be required in the second step of the nonlinear
process (Fig. 8a) instead of the ω1 photon. This is further supported by looking at the polarization Im(ρ32) as a
function of M , and one observes sharp absorption at those values of M for which J1(M ) = 0 (not shown here). This
clearly shows that in absence of the ω1 + Ω photon there would be no spontaneous emission assisted gain process.
Hence, the availability of the intermediate photon which would take the population from level |3i to level |1i and the
probe resonant with the periodic sideband response created by the FM ﬁeld plays a crucial role in obtaining large
gain.

It should be noted that the nonlinear optical process discussed above is assisted by the spontaneous emission and
hence does not necessitate any kind of population inversion. The FM ﬁeld plays a central role in creating the rich
periodic Floquet structure whose quasienergy levels are probed by the probe ﬁeld. The on-resonance pump photon
acts as a hub about which the above nonlinear process occurs resulting in gain. We would also like to point out
that if an amplitude modulated ﬁeld (with modulation frequency α) is used instead of the FM ﬁeld, then, due to the
availability of only a pair of sideband photons (ω1 ± α) the gain from the above nonlinear process will be present only
at a pair of frequencies. It is the availability of ω1 ± nΩ photons in the FM ﬁeld that results in gain at a large number
of sideband frequencies far removed from the central frequency.

IV. CONCLUSION

In summary, we have presented an analysis of the occurrence of gain in a V-type system in presence of FM pump
ﬁeld. We have analyzed both the steady state and the transient dynamics of the light ampliﬁcation process. In the
steady state analysis we have tried to bring out the signiﬁcant role played by the modulation term over and above
the coherence term which is dominant in the conventional monochromatic pump schemes. We obtained the Floquet
quasienergies that provide the explanation for the two comb of frequencies in the probe spectrum; furthermore the
quasienergy spectrum was used to choose appropriate index of modulation M such that the resulting probe spectrum
contains a semi-inﬁnite set of consecutive gain peaks far removed from resonance and could be exploited to obtain
short-wavelength lasing. In between the gain peaks anomalous dispersion is obtained accompanied by negligible gain-
absorption, which could be utilized to obtain distortion free superluminal pulse propagation in any desired frequency
regime and over a large bandwidth which can be increased by increasing the modulation frequency Ω. The gain

8

obtained in experiments based on LWI schemes is severely limited in its magnitude. The advantage of gain obtained
using the FM ﬁeld is the signiﬁcant increment in its magnitude ∼ 103% due to numerous sideband contributions,
and no population inversion between the atomic states. It should be noted that the occurrence of gain at frequencies
far removed from resonance could also make this system attractive in terms of the possibility of reduced noise due
to quantum ﬂuctuations, further investigations along these lines would be fruitful. The study of transient dynamics
showed that both the probe and the pump ﬁelds experience transient gain. The probe gain is not due to population
inversion in the atomic state basis, moreover, in certain regimes one could even rule out gain via SRS process and two-
photon inversion. We have described the physical process, based on spontaneous emission assisted nonlinear optical
process, which is responsible for inversionless gain. This eﬀect is further corroborated by the spectrum obtained as a
function of the index of modulation in Fig. 5a.

FIG. 1. Schematic of the V-type system coupled to a frequency modulated ﬁeld on the |1i ↔ |3i transition, the central
frequency ω1 of the FM ﬁeld is shown with a dash-dot line. A monochromatic probe ﬁeld of frequency ω2 and an incoherent
pump Λ (dotted line) couple the |2i → |3i transition. The spontaneous emission decays from levels |1i and |2i to level |3i are
represented by γ1 and γ2 (wavy line), respectively. The detuning of the central frequency ω1 of the FM ﬁeld from the atomic
resonance is ∆1 and the probe detuning is ∆2.

FIG. 2. Steady state probe absorption-gain spectra - (a) Without the incoherent pump the probe exhibits absorption as
Im(ρ32) < 0. (b) In presence of the incoherent pump with Λ = 0.1γ1 alternate peaks exhibit gain. (c) The contribution to ρ32
from the terms F1 and F2 is signiﬁcant only at frequencies given by Eq. (7), whereas the contribution from the modulation term
F3 is the largest. The other relevant parameters are M = 5.2, Ω = 30γ1, ∆1 = 20γ1, G1 = 20γ1, G2 = .01γ1, and γ2 = 0.03γ1.
The scale on the graphs is chosen to highlight the sideband structure and hence some of the maxima of the resonances are not
shown.

FIG. 3. (a) Plot of a few quasienergies λ vs M for a ﬁxed value of coupling ﬁeld strength G1 (= 20γ1), detuning ∆1(= 20γ1)
and the modulation frequency Ω (= 30γ1). The quasienergy level indicated by a solid line periodically crosses the zero energy
level. (b) Steady state probe response for various values of Λ with the index of modulation M = 2.915 which is the ﬁrst zero of
the quasienergy level shown in (a) by a solid line. The line plots are for incoherent pump Λ/γ1 = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0.
The other relevant parameters are G2 = .01γ1, and γ2 = 0.03γ1. The scale on the graphs is chosen to highlight the sideband
structure and hence some of the maxima of the resonances are not shown.

FIG. 4. Enlarged plot of the atomic response in the region ∆2/γ1 = (70, 120) with all the parameters same as Fig. 3 and
M = 2.915. In the region ∆2/γ1 = (90, 100) the probe ﬁeld experiences anomalous dispersion [d Re(ρ32)/dω2< 0] accompanied
by negligible absorption/gain [Im(ρ32) ≈ 0]. Such regions occur between each pair of gain peaks for ∆2/γ1 > 0 in Fig. 3c. The
slope of the Re(ρ32) can be further increased by increasing the rate of the incoherent pump.

FIG. 5. Plot of the resonant (∆1 = ∆2 = 0) steady state atomic response at the |3i ↔ |2i transition as a function of the

The F2 contribution is responsible for gain for weak modulation 0 ≤ M < 1; for strong modulation F3 is the dominant term.
To highlight the role played by the F3 term in obtaining gain the large absorption minima are not shown completely. (c) The
population in various atomic levels: the solid, dashed and the dotted lines indicate ρ11, ρ22, and ρ33, respectively. The other
relevant parameters are Ω = 80γ1, G1 = 20γ1, G2 = .01γ1, γ2 = 0.3γ1 and Λ = 0.5γ1.

FIG. 8. The physical mechanism, involving spontaneous emission assisted nonlinear optical processes, responsible for inver-
sionless gain. In steady state, process (a) prevails over process (b) because γ1 > γ2. Note also that when ∆1 = 0, for process
(a) to occur the photon ω1 has to be resonant with the |1i ↔ |3i transition. In its absence process (a) is suppressed resulting
in probe absorption rather than probe gain.

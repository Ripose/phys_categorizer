The concept of a plane scatterer that was developed earlier for scalar waves is generalized so
that polarization of light is included. Starting from a Lippmann-Schwinger formalism for vector
waves, we show that the Green function has to be regularized before T-matrices can be deﬁned in a
consistent way. After the regularization, optical modes and Green functions are determined exactly
for ﬁnite structures built up of an arbitrary number of parallel planes, at arbitrary positions, and
where each plane can have diﬀerent optical properties. The model is applied to the special case
of ﬁnite crystals consisting of regularly spaced identical planes, where analytical methods can be
taken further and only light numerical tasks remain. The formalism is used to calculate position-
and orientation-dependent spontaneous-emission rates inside and near the ﬁnite photonic crystals.
The results show that emission rates and reﬂection properties can diﬀer strongly for scalar and for
vector waves. The ﬁnite size of the crystal inﬂuences the emission rates. For parallel dipoles close to
a plane, emission into guided modes gives rise to a peak in the frequency-dependent emission rate.

INTRODUCTION

Photonic crystals are a well-studied subject nowadays,
both theoretically and experimentally [1]. Of funda-
mental importance is the prediction [2] that in three-
dimensional photonic crystals that meet a tough combi-
nation of requirements, light propagation will be com-
pletely inhibited in all directions and a photonic band
gap will show up for certain frequencies of light.
It is
important for technology that photonic crystals can be
created that guide light with low losses, and bend light
on a scale of an optical wavelength. The latter properties
do not require a band gap in all three dimensions.

A photonic-band-gap crystal would reﬂect light for all
angles of incidence, when the frequency of the light lies
within the gap. However, lower-dimensional photonic
crystals such as Bragg mirrors can also be omnidirec-
tional mirrors, without having a band gap [3, 4, 5]. Thus,
external light sources can only give an indication that
there is a band gap or a proof that there is no gap.

Internal light sources such as excited atoms do a better
job in probing a band gap, because only a gap would com-
pletely inhibit spontaneous emission by internal sources
[2]. For the same reason, a photonic-band-gap crystal
would be a whole new playground in quantum optics,
both when one is interested in spontaneous emission in
itself, and in processes which normally are obscured or
made less eﬃcient because of spontaneous emission. Not

only emission rates would be strongly modiﬁed inside
a band-gap crystal, but also resonant dipole-dipole in-
teractions, for example, as they are mediated by the
electromagnetic ﬁeld [6]. The focus of this paper is on
spontaneous-emission rates of visible light.

For atomic transition frequencies in the band gap of
an inﬁnite three-dimensional photonic crystal, emission
rates vanish everywhere in the inhomogeneous structure.
In practice, such a uniform suppression of emission rates
has not yet been observed for visible light: evidence of
crystals exhibiting a full photonic band gap in the visible
has not been reported to date. Even when in the fu-
ture such crystals will exist, position-dependent emission
rates will occur at the edges of the crystals. In general,
spontaneous-emission rates of inhomogeneous dielectrics
with a high refractive-index contrast, including photonic
crystals, are strongly position and orientation dependent.
Calculated spontaneous-emission rates in this paper will
prove this point. Also, ﬁnite-size eﬀects will show up in
our calculations. The model studied here is a ﬁnite pho-
tonic crystal consisting of a ﬁnite number of parallel and
inﬁnitely thin planes. More about our model will be said
later in this Introduction.

In many experiments, dipole orientations are hard
to control. When averaged over dipole orientations,
spontaneous-emission rates are proportional to a quan-
tity called the ‘local optical density of states’ (LDOS)
[7, 8]. The concept of a local density of states was bor-
rowed from solid-state physics. The local optical density
of states was ﬁrst named the ‘local radiative density of
states’ [7], which is the same quantity.

Interestingly, the calculation of position-dependent
spontaneous-emission rates also has a bearing on the in-

terpretation of measurements performed with a near-ﬁeld
scanning optical microscope (or NSOM). In these mea-
surements, a sample is illuminated through the tip of the
microscope, and scattered light is recorded. In a simple
model, the disturbance of the optical ﬁeld by bringing
the tip of the microscope to the sample is assumed to
be weak, and the tip is modelled as a dipole with a cer-
tain strength and orientation. Then, if the light scattered
in all directions would be recorded, the measured signal
would be proportional to the local spontaneous-emission
rate at the position of the tip in the absence of the tip
[9].

After the above general considerations, we now turn
to the topic how spontaneous-emission rates inside pho-
tonic crystals are actually being calculated. The exis-
tence of a band gap in an inﬁnite photonic crystal can
be inferred from a band structure calculation, which for
a three-dimensional photonic crystals is an art in itself
(see the recent review [10]). Quite another and more
diﬃcult matter is it to calculate emission rates inside in-
ﬁnite crystals [11, 12]. Emission rates inside or near ﬁnite
photonic crystals are even harder to calculate. Other in-
teresting quantities would be near-ﬁeld or far-ﬁeld spec-
tra of internal sources, or dipole-dipole interactions and
superradiance eﬀects of atoms embedded in a ﬁnite three-
dimensional photonic crystal, to name a few complex pro-
cesses in a complex environment. In such cases, results
of calculations are hard to check and - even if correct -
they might not give much insight.

It is therefore very useful to study complex processes in
simpliﬁed models for photonic crystals. Widely used is
the so-called quasi one-dimensional model (or isotropic
model) for photonic crystals [13], where it is assumed
that the red edge of the stop bands of the crystal occur at
the same band-edge frequency for all three-dimensional
propagation directions, and similarly for the blue band
edge. Such a model will describe qualitatively correct the
processes well inside the band gap, while overestimating
eﬀects of the photonic crystal at the edges of the gap.
The isotropic model also neglects all position and orien-
tation dependence of emission rates outside the band gap.
Inspired by the model calculations, more realistic numer-
ical calculations have recently appeared that indeed show
the weaknesses of the isotropic model [12].

In this paper another simple model is proposed, one
which takes into account the strong spatial and orien-
tational dependence of optical properties and the ﬁnite
size of the crystals. On the other hand, it gives up the
existence of a full band gap, as only variations of the
refractive index in one dimension are considered. Dielec-
tric slabs are modelled as inﬁnitely thin planes, which
will be called plane scatterers. A multiple-scattering for-
malism is set up in which optical modes and the Green
function (a tensor, really) can be calculated exactly for
crystals consisting of an arbitrary number of plane scat-
terers. The present model is a generalization of previous
work that treated scalar waves only [5]. The inclusion of
polarization of light will turn out not to be straightfor-

2

ward.

Inﬁnitely thin planes were used as model systems in
photonics before, for example in [14] where light propaga-
tion was considered in one dimension only and for an inﬁ-
nite crystal. The model was generalized in [15], where in-
ﬁnite photonic crystals were built of inﬁnitely thin planes
and their band structure was determined for waves prop-
agating in three dimensions.
In [16], both inﬁnite and
ﬁnite crystals of planes were considered and their trans-
mission and reﬂection properties were studied with the
use of transfer matrix methods. The inﬁnite crystal was
again considered in [17, 18, 19, 20] and named the ‘Dirac-
comb superlattice’. Frequency-dependent emission rates
were determined for several positions in the unit cell and
both TE- [17, 19] and TM-waves [18, 20] were considered.
The periodicity of inﬁnite crystals makes that Bloch’s
theorem can be used in the analysis. Finite photonic
crystals do not have this advantage and the analysis of
the optical properties is usually more diﬃcult. Position-
dependent spontaneous-emission rates remain to be ex-
plored in model photonic crystals consisting of a ﬁnite
number of plane scatterers, where light propagation in
all three dimensions is taken into account, for both po-
larization directions.

It has been known for a long time that spontaneous-
emission rates of atoms change when positioned at dis-
tances on the order of the wavelength of light away from
a mirror [21, 22, 23]. A recent surprise was the mea-
surement and analysis that even a distant mirror (25cm
away) can change emission rates when lenses are used
and when the atomic positions are controlled with a sub-
wavelength precision (a few nanometers) [24, 25].

More complicated than emission near a mirror is it
to calculate emission rates of atoms in or near one-
dimensional photonic crystals. A multi-purpose formal-
ism for calculating optical modes in layered dielectrics
[26] was used in [4] to calculate emission rates inside ﬁ-
nite periodic layered structures, especially inside struc-
tures that reﬂect light incoming from all directions, the
so-called ‘omnidirectional mirrors’ [3].

Interestingly,

light transmission through ﬁnite one-
dimensional photonic crystals can be found exactly in
terms of the transmission through a unit cell, the number
N of unit cells, and in terms of the Bloch wave vector of
the corresponding inﬁnite crystal structure. In [27], this
is shown for a simple unit cell containing two layers, but
it was also proven for general unit cells [28]. This remark-
able result was reviewed in [29], where its importance is
stressed not only in optics but also in acoustics, quan-
In the
tum mechanics, and other branches of physics.
T-matrix formalism of this paper (which diﬀers from the
usual transfer matrix method for layered dielectrics), we
ﬁnd similar analytical results, also involving the Bloch
wave vector. Such attractive analytical results are not
available for more complex dielectrics such as ﬁnite two-
[30, 31] or three-dimensional photonic crystals [32], so
that in those cases the use of eﬃcient numerical tech-
niques is essential.

The advantage of our plane-scatterer model is that
modes and Green functions (and therefore emission rates)
can be calculated exactly in a Lippmann-Schwinger for-
malism, for every ﬁnite crystal size, and that light propa-
gation in all directions is taken into account. Lippmann-
Schwinger formalisms are more commonly used [33], but
when the ﬁnite volumes of dielectric scatterers are fully
taken into account, numerical discretization of the dielec-
tric is required and the model stops being simple [31, 34].
To be sure, the simplicity of our model entails that in
some aspects it becomes less realistic, as will be stressed
where appropriate.

In Sec. II, multiple scattering of light is introduced
and central equations are derived in representation-
independent notation. In Sec. III the free-space Green
tensor is regularized and a T-matrix of a plane scatterer
for light waves is derived. Sec. IV discusses all optical
modes (propagating and guided modes, including polar-
ization) that exist in crystals of plane scatterers. Po-
sition and orientation dependent spontaneous-emission
rates are calculated in Sec. V. Conclusions can be found
in Sec. VI.

II. MULTIPLE-SCATTERING THEORY FOR
VECTOR WAVES

Some important equations of multiple-scattering the-
ory [33] will be presented, mostly in representation-
independent notation, for light in arbitrary inhomoge-
neous dielectrics. In later sections a particular class of
dielectrics will be studied and a suitable representation
is chosen, but then the involved notation might obscure
the general structure of the equations.

The scattering problem is solved exactly once the T-

There may exist optical modes that are bound to the

It follows that bound solutions of the electric ﬁeld will
correspond to the poles of the T-matrix. Actually,
Eq. (6c) also shows that a nonzero solution for E(ω) can
only occur when T(ω) has a pole. The T-matrix not only
solves the scattering problem for incident ﬁelds but also
contains all information about bound modes.

(6b) for the electric ﬁeld shows that the Green function
can also be expressed in terms of the T-matrix, as given
by Eq. (10b).

Equation (10) also holds when the total potential V(ω)
is a sum of single-scatterer potentials Vα(ω). By iterating
one ﬁnds that the total T-matrix for an arbitrary number
N of these scatterers is

III. PLANE SCATTERERS FOR VECTOR
WAVES

The general results of multiple-scattering theory that
were presented in Sec. II will now be applied to dielectrics
that can be described as a collection of parallel planes.
A suitable representation is chosen, and speciﬁc forms of
the potential V, the free-space Green function G0, and
the incoming electric ﬁeld E0 are determined. With this,
T-matrices for a single plane and for an arbitrary number
of planes are derived.

The above Fourier representation is not what we need.
It is convenient to work in the “plane representation”:
in two-dimensional Fourier space in the directions par-
allel to the planes and in real space in the ˆz-direction
perpendicular to the planes. For the polarization repre-
sentation choose the orthonormal basis

ˆz is the unit vector in the z-direction; ˆvk is the unit vec-
tor in the direction of the projection of the wave vec-
tor k on the plane, so that the wave vector k has a
component kk in the ˆvk-direction and its full represen-
tation is (0, kk, kz); the sk-polarization direction is or-
thogonal to the optical plane that is spanned by the
other two basis vectors. Then the operator L(ω) has

The T-matrix of a plane scatterer for vector waves can
be found by solving the appropriate Lippmann-Schwinger
equation (6). A plane wave incident from z =
with
wave vector k and arbitrary amplitude E0 and trans-
verse polarization vector σk = (σs, σv, σz) is scattered
by a plane at z = zα. Because of the symmetry in the
in-plane directions, it is convenient to choose the plane
representation for the LS equation. In terms of the Dirac-
notation, the electric ﬁeld is a “ket”; the plane represen-
tation is found by taking the inner product of Eq. (6) for
the electric ﬁeld with the ”bra”

the LS equation corresponding to this incident ﬁeld is

A plane is assumed to be inﬁnitely thin and it can be de-

(A speciﬁc model potential will be chosen in Sec. III F.)
The integral can be evaluated immediately and we get

The usual way to solve this equation would be to put the
position z equal to zα and to solve for Ekσ(kk, zα, ω).
The result would then be inserted back into the above
equation to obtain an expression for Ekσ(kk, z, ω).

However, the Green tensor G0 is not deﬁned when the
positions z and zα are identical, because of the delta func-
tion in the component Gzz
[Eq. (18d)]. One could just
0
neglect the delta function, as might be correct in other
situations [35], but it will be argued in Sec. III C that
this procedure would be wrong in our case. Therefore,
the Green tensor (18) is not suited for setting up a the-
ory for the scattering of vector waves by inﬁnitely thin
planes.

It is known that “regularization” of Green functions is
sometimes needed when modelling ﬁnite-sized scatterers
as mathematical objects with zero volume, in order to
have a model that is relevant for optics. (Not always:
regularization was not needed for scalar waves scattering
oﬀ planes [5].) In a regularization procedure usually a
cutoﬀ parameter is introduced that modiﬁes the behav-
ior of Green functions at distances much smaller than op-
tical wavelengths, and mathematical problems are thus
overcome. In some cases, the regularization parameter
can be sent to inﬁnity in the ﬁnal stage, while in other
cases the cutoﬀ parameter must be kept ﬁnite. For exam-
ple, for point scatterers the problem of diverging Green
functions occurs both for scalar and for vector waves.
Point scatterers have been studied extensively and sev-
eral regularization schemes have been proposed (see [36]
and references therein).

The same regularization procedure will now be cho-
sen for plane scatterers as was done before for point
scatterers [36]: a high-momentum cutoﬀ is introduced
in three-dimensional Fourier space:
instead of the free-
space Green function G0(k, ω) of Eq. (14), a regularized
free-space Green function ˜G0(k, ω) will be used. The lat-
ter is deﬁned in terms of the former as

˜G0(k, ω) =

G0(k, ω).

The cutoﬀ momentum Λ is assumed to be much larger
than the magnitude ω/c of the optical momentum, so
that at optical wavelengths ˜G0 ≃
G0. The eﬀect of this
cutoﬀ in the real-space representation is also known [36].
Here its eﬀect on the Green function in the plane repre-
sentation is important. After an inverse Fourier transfor-
mation, again only in the z-direction, one obtains (again

(kk, z, zα, ω).
In this eﬀective description, - where the
T-matrix is denoted by T rather than ˜T - the cutoﬀ pa-
rameter Λ does not occur anymore. The cutoﬀ was ne-
cessary in order to set up a scattering theory and it shows
up in the elements of the scattering theory such as the
T-matrix (27) and the regularized Green function (24).
It does not show up in the electric ﬁeld, and precisely this
enables us to arrive at the eﬀective description. Note also
that the (large) value of Gzz

0 has become irrelevant.

The eﬀective description that is obtained here after a
regularization is diﬀerent from a theory where the delta
function in Gzz
0 [see Eq. (18d)] would simply be removed
[35]. Leaving out the delta function in the LS equa-
tion (21) will result in a nonzero T zz, in contrast with
Eq. (28). Furthermore, the T-matrix would have the un-
wanted eﬀect that the transmitted part of an incoming
wave would not be parallel to the incoming wave. The
conclusion is that a regularization of the Green function
was necessary, even when in the end the cutoﬀ could be
sent to inﬁnity.

The equation (28) deﬁnes a true mode of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld in the presence of a single plane scatterer,
in terms of a linearly-polarized incoming plane wave with
arbitrary angle of incidence. This is not the complete set
of modes. Other modes, not corresponding to an incom-
ing wave, will be discussed in Sec. (IV B), both for a
single plane and for a crystal of planes.

D. Transmission and energy conservation

The transmission of light through the plane can be
found by choosing z > zα in Eq. (28). The transmitted
wave can be expressed in terms of the incoming wave
as Ekσ(kk, z, ω) = τ (kk, ω)

Energy conservation puts a constraint (called ‘optical

scatterer can take. The optical theorem for a plane that
scatters scalar waves was found before [5]. Since s-waves
map on scalar waves, the optical theorem for the ss-
component of the T-matrix can be given immediately:

For reﬂection and transmission of p-polarized light,
only the matrix element T vv is important. Again, we
are interested in the form that this matrix element can
take when optical energy is conserved. This is the case
when the ˆz-component of the Poynting vector is the same
before and after the plane. An incoming p-polarized
plane wave gives the electric ﬁeld (28). With a Maxwell
equation the accompanying magnetic ﬁeld B can also

E. T-matrix for N planes

Now that the Green function and the T-matrix of a
single plane are known, a multiple-scattering theory can
be set up. Assume that there are N plane scatterers,
placed at arbitrary positions. Assume them to be par-
allel, so that s- and p-polarized light do not mix in the
scattering process.

In the general expression (12) for the T-matrix of a
complex dielectric in terms of its simple parts, Green
functions are always sandwiched between T-matrices of
scatterers at diﬀerent positions. For unequal plane posi-
tions zα and zβ, the value of ˜G0(kk, zβ, zα, ω) is ﬁnite
and it can be taken to be equal to the unregularized
G0(kk, zβ, zα, ω), because diﬀerent planes are at optical
distances apart. Further regularizations are therefore not
required in order to ﬁnd the N -plane T-matrix.

×

As shown in the Appendix, higher-order terms in the
series (12) correspond to higher-order matrix multipli-
N matrices. The multiplication prop-
cations of N
erty makes that for parallel planes, the series (12) can
be summed exactly.
In the Appendix it is shown how
the summation can be done even in the general case that
all planes may have diﬀerent optical properties, and are
placed at arbitrary non-coinciding positions. Here we
specify that all planes are identical. This gives the central
result of this section, the N -plane T-matrix for scattering
by vector waves:

×

From now on, assume that the N planes are placed
at regular distances from each other, with a spacing a
between neighbors. The necessary matrix inversions in
Eq. (35) can then be performed analytically for both po-
larization directions. The s-wave case maps identically
on the situation for scalar waves, for which the analytical
inversion was discussed at length in [5]; for p-waves the
inversion trick goes analogous and it will not be presented
here.

A result from the analytical inversion is that T-matrix
elements and therefore the optical properties of the N -
plane crystal strongly depend on the Bloch wave vec-
tors Ks(kk, ω) and Kp(kk, ω). For p-polarized light
the Bloch wave vector is given by arccos(Cp)/a, with
Cp = cos(kza) + C′

In general, Cp is a complex constant. However, if the op-
tical theorem (32) holds, then the imaginary part of Cp
becomes identically zero, and the single-plane T-matrix
will be of the form (33). Likewise, Ks is deﬁned as
arccos(Cs)/a for a quantity Cs that becomes real when
the optical theorem Eq. (30) for s-polarized light holds
[5]. In those cases, the expressions for Cs,p become rather

F. A model for the optical potential

The most general T-matrices (31) and (33) feature as
yet unspeciﬁed optical potentials Fs,p. These should be
real when energy is conserved, but for the rest they can be
arbitrary functions with the frequency and the in-plane
wave vector as variables.

−

In [5], plane scatterers were introduced as a simpli-
ﬁed model for dielectric slabs of ﬁnite thickness d and
nondispersive dielectric function ε(ω) = ε. The optical
potential for the plane scatterer in this model is obtained
via the limiting process of making the thickness d of the
dielectric slab smaller and increasing the polarizability
(ε
1), while keeping their product constant and equal
to the “eﬀective thickness” Deﬀ. (The quantity Deﬀ /a is
called the “grating strength” in [19, 20].) Following the
same limiting procedure as in [5], we ﬁnd the optical po-
V (ω) = Deﬀ (ω/c)2, identical for
tential Fs,p(kk, ω) =
the two polarizations. Spatial dispersion and anisotropy
would have shown up in the optical potentials as a kk- and
ˆkk-dependence, respectively. These two phenomena were
neglected already as early as in the wave equation (4).

−

In general, p-polarized light diﬀers from s-polarized
light in that the former will have a Brewster angle at
which no light is reﬂected from a dielectric interface
n2). The Brewster angle θB equals tan−1(n2/n1).
(n1 →
In the limiting procedure for going from a ﬁnite slab-
in-air to an inﬁnitely thin plane-in-air, the dielectric
contrast √ε/1 is going to inﬁnity and consequently the
Brewster angle becomes 90◦ in that limit. Therefore, in
our limiting procedure, a plane scatterer will not have a
Brewster angle at the same angle as the ﬁnite dielec-
In line with this,
tric slab that one starts out with.
in [15] a single-plane reﬂection for p-polarized light was
determined that is nonzero for all angles of incidence.
The p-polarized propagating modes for a system of plane
scatterers will therefore diﬀer substantially from the cor-
responding modes in a slab structure. The absence of a
Brewster eﬀect was also noticed in [18] where the inﬁnite-
crystal version of the plane-scatterer model is treated.

IV. OPTICAL MODES AND
OMNIDIRECTIONAL MIRRORS

A. Propagating modes

The optical modes are the harmonic solutions of the
wave equation (4). With the solution (34) of the T-

matrix, the modes that correspond to a nonzero incoming
plane wave can be given explicitly as

Ekσ(kk, z, ω) = E0σkeikz z

G0(kk, z, zα, ω)

T(N )

αβ (kk, ω)

σkE0eikzzβ .

·

·

Xα,β

These propagating (or radiative) modes are labelled by
the incoming wave vector k and polarization σk. The
sine of the angle of incidence (with respect to a vector
normal to the planes) is equal to kkc/ω. The amplitudes
of the s-polarized modes [with σk = (1, 0, 0)] are identical
to the corresponding amplitudes for scalar waves; the p-
polarized modes [σk = (0, kz/k,
kk/k)] have no scalar
analogues.

−

For light with wave vector and frequency such that
Cs,p > 1 [see Eq. (37)], the Bloch wave vector is purely
imaginary for the elastic scatterers that we consider.
Similarly, for Cs,p <
1, the Bloch wave vector equals
π plus an imaginary number. In both situations the light
will feel a stop band, meaning that it will be 100% re-
ﬂected when falling on a semi-inﬁnite system of planes.
Otherwise, when
1 < Cs,p < 1, the Bloch wave vector
is real and light can propagate inside the crystal. More
will be said about the Bloch wave vectors later in this
section.

−

−

Some plots of mode proﬁles will now be presented. As-
sume that light comes in from the left. For perpendicu-
larly incident light, there is no diﬀerence between s- and
p-polarization. In Fig. 1 the mode proﬁles (or squared
absolute values of mode functions) for s- and p-polarized
light inside a ten-plane crystal are compared both for an
incoming angle of 30◦ and for 60◦. Fig. 1(a) shows that at
an angle of 30◦ the mode proﬁles corresponding to both
polarizations do not diﬀer much yet. Both modes decay
rapidly inside the crystal structure and are reﬂected (al-
most) completely. The Bloch wave vectors are complex
for both polarizations. Only for the s-wave the polar-
ization directions of the incoming and the reﬂected wave
are equal, so that the amplitude of its mode proﬁle at
the left side of the crystal is four times the amplitude of
the incoming electric ﬁeld.

The situation is diﬀerent at an incoming angle of 60◦,
as shown in Fig. 1(b): the mode proﬁle of the s-polarized
light again rapidly decays inside the crystal (and the cor-
responding Bloch wave vector again has an imaginary
part), whereas the p-polarized light can propagate inside
the crystal and is transmitted almost completely (and
the Bloch wave vector is real). For this frequency and
incoming angle, the crystal is a good polarization ﬁlter.
The mode proﬁles in Figs. 1(a,b) of the s-polarized
waves are continuous whereas p-polarized waves are dis-
continuous at the positions of the planes. This reﬂects
the boundary conditions: the tangential components of
the electric ﬁelds must be continuous and the normal
components must show a jump at a dielectric interface.
The electric ﬁeld of s-polarized light only has a tangen-
tial component, while p-polarized light consists of both

9

tangential and normal components. This explains the dif-
ferences in the mode proﬁles for s- and p-waves. Notice
that in our Green-function formalism, boundary condi-
tions are automatically satisﬁed, whereas in related work
based on transfer-matrix methods, boundary conditions
must be considered explicitly [15, 16, 20].

(relative) transmitted light intensity. For light incident
perpendicularly to the planes, both transverse polariza-
tion vectors are equivalent and accordingly in Fig. 2(a),
the graphs for s- and p-polarized light overlap. Diﬀer-
ences between the two polarizations do appear for non-
normal incidence. In Fig. 2(b) the angle of incidence is
60◦. The red edges of the stop bands for s-polarized light
move to slightly higher frequencies and the widths of the
stop bands become larger. For p-polarized light the red
edges of the stop bands shift to the blue much faster, and
the faster so for larger angles of incidence.

For scalar waves, a crystal of plane scatterers can be
an omnidirectional mirror [5], which means that waves
experience a stop bands for all angles of incidence. For
vector waves, the crystal will only be an omnidirectional
mirror if there are frequency intervals in which the crystal
is an omnidirectional mirror both for s- and p-waves.

As stated earlier, it is the Bloch wave vectors K that
distinguish between light that can propagate inside the
crystal (real K) and light that feels a stop band (when K
is an imaginary number or π plus an imaginary number).
In our formalism, the Bloch wave vectors are the arc
cosines of the constants Cs and Cp given in Eq. (37). As
is shown in detail in [5], these Bloch wave vectors show up
in expressions for the N -plane T-matrix T (N ). It must be
said that in the present T-matrix formalism it is not obvi-
ous simply by looking at the equations that a stop band
occurs whenever the Bloch wave vector has a nonzero
imaginary part. Nevertheless, we conclude from our nu-
merical calculations that the relation does exist. To give
an example, of the four modes in the ﬁgures 1(a,b), only
the p-polarized light incoming at 60◦ has a correspond-
ing real Bloch wave vector. It is an interesting fact that
the Bloch wave vector, the role of which is obvious in
inﬁnite crystals, also plays an important role in ﬁnite pe-
riodic structures. This was already noticed before in the
context of transfer matrix methods [27, 28, 29]; here we
see the importance of the Bloch wave vector for ﬁnite
periodic structures in a T-matrix formalism.

For light of a frequency corresponding to a/λ = 0.5
and planes with Deﬀ = 0.46, the s-waves are reﬂected
omnidirectionally [5]. In Fig. 3 we plot both constants
Cs and Cp for this frequency, as a function of angle of inci-
dence. Unlike for s-waves, for p-waves there are incident
angles larger than the critical angle θc & 55◦ for which
the values of Cp are between -1 and 1. Light incident
with these large angles can propagate inside the crystal
and therefore the crystal is not an omnidirectional mir-
ror for this frequency. Actually, this information could

for larger Deﬀ the critical angle θc in-
creases, but it can be shown by expanding Eq. (37b)
around θin = 90◦ that for every ﬁnite Deﬀ /a and a/λ
there always is a ﬁnite interval of angles corresponding
to propagating p-polarized light. In conclusion, crystals
of identical and equidistant plane scatterers can reﬂect
vector waves in almost all (but not in all) directions.

B. Guided modes

Besides propagating modes there can also be bound
modes that do not correspond to incoming light (see
Sec. II). Bound modes can be found by solving the LS
equation in the absence of an incoming ﬁeld.
In crys-
tals of plane scatterers, bound modes are guided modes.
They have imaginary wave vectors in the z-direction and
they decay exponentially away from the planes. Their
in-plane wave vectors kk are larger than ω/c. With each

mode, be it of the propagating or guided type, a nonzero
local density of states is associated.
In the following,
guided modes will be searched by looking for nonzero
densities of states. (This is a method alternative to the
one used in [5] where guided modes of scalar waves were
identiﬁed.)

For vector waves, the local optical density of states

N (r, ω) is deﬁned by [7]

so it is a scalar proportional to the trace over the imag-
inary part of the Green tensor G(r, r, ω). In planar ge-
ometries the latter can best be found as an integral over
the Green tensor in the plane representation:

The local density of states can only be nonzero if the

of this integrand G(kk, z, z, ω) have nonzero imaginary
parts for a certain kk > ω/c. For the crystals of plane

All three diagonal components of G0(kk, z, z′, ω) become
real quantities for kk > ω/c, and indeed there are no
guided modes in free space. On the other hand, the

oﬀ-diagonal elements Gvz
0 become purely imag-
inary when kk > ω/c and the latter elements do show
up in the diagonal elements of G. However, since they
always show up in paired products, for example in the
term Gzv
0 , they also give a real contribution
to diagonal elements of G. The T-matrix elements are
also real when kk > ω/c, except when the matrix has
a pole. Therefore, all guided modes must correspond to
poles of the s- or p-components of the N -plane T-matrix
T(N ) [see Eq. (35)].

First the guided modes of a single plane will be deter-
mined. There can be a guided mode when either T ss
or T vv in Eq. (28) has a pole. Now T ss has a pole
0 (kk, zα, zα, ω) vanishes. Using the same
when 1
model for the optical potential as in Sec. III F, we ﬁnd
the dispersion relation κ(1)

only one guided mode corresponding to s-polarized light.

as a plane scatterer. However, in the physical situations
that we are interested in, the eﬀective thickness is real
and positive (see Sec. III F). Therefore, there is no guided
mode corresponding to p-polarized light for a single plane
scatterer. This result was also derived in [15], where only
the cases of a single plane and inﬁnitely many planes were
considered.

At this point it is worthwhile to compare the guided
modes of a dielectric slab (thickness d, dielectric constant
ε) in air with the guided modes of an inﬁnitely thin plane
with eﬀective thickness Deﬀ = (ε
1)d. For the slab, the
number M of guided modes is the same for both polar-
izations in the special case considered here, and equal to

Here, [X] stands for the largest integer smaller than or
equal to X. In the large-wavelength limit there is a single
guided mode for each polarization direction. The second
guided mode appears when a/λ = a/(2√dDeﬀ). For ex-
ample, for d = 0.1a and Deﬀ = 0.46a, a second guided
mode exists when a/λ > 2.3. We are interested in fre-
quencies around a/λ = 0.5, where the ﬁrst stopband for
normally incident light occurs (see Fig. 2). For these fre-
quencies, both the plane scatterer and the dielectric slab
have a single s-polarized guided mode; the slab has a sin-
gle p-polarized guided mode, whereas the plane scatterer
has no such guided mode at all.

αβ

Now we determine the guided modes of a ﬁnite crys-
tal of N parallel and equidistant planes, using the same
Green-function method as for the single plane. First look
for the poles of the component T ss,(N )
(kk, ω). This is
easy, because this component is identical to the N -plane
T-matrix T (N ) for scalar waves, for which it was found
that there are at most N guided modes in a crystal of N
planes [5]. For an inﬁnite number of planes, the guided
modes form a band, as was found in [15, 19]. Now look
for guided modes corresponding to p-polarized light. The
poles of the component T vv,(N )
(kk, ω) occur when the de-
terminant det[(Tvv,(N ))−1] is equal to zero. An expres-
sion for this determinant can be found just like was done
for scalar waves in [5]. The result is that for p-polarized
light there are guided modes if the following equation has
nontrivial solutions ω(κ):

The Bloch wave vector Kp is still deﬁned as a−1 times
the arccosine of Cp, which reads Cp = cosh(κa) +
[(κc2F )/(2ω2)] sinh(κa) in terms of κ.

Eq. (43) should lead to the dispersion relations ω(κ)
for the guided modes, if they exist. When increasing
the frequency, new guided modes would appear that at
ﬁrst are only just captured by the structure so that κ =
0+. It is therefore convenient to count the guided modes
in the small-κ limit. Let the constant χ be deﬁned as

1 + F c2/(aω2). Then Cp can be written up to second

a
order in κ as

p

Cp = 1 + (χκ)2/2 + o(κ3) = cosh(χκ) + o(κ3).

(44)

≡

To the same order in κ, the Bloch wave vector Kp be-
comes equal to iχκ/a. Therefore, solutions of Eq. (43)
will only exist when sinh[(N + 1)χκ] equals sinh(N χκ),
or equivalently when χ
0. Since F is taken to be
Deﬀ(ω/c)2, there are guided modes for p-polarized light
whenever 1 + Deﬀ/a = 0. So in ﬁnite crystals of N
planes with a positive eﬀective thickness, there are no
guided modes corresponding to p-polarized light. This is
in agreement with the result just obtained for the single
plane, and with the results in [15, 20] for inﬁnite crystals.
In conclusion, there are at most N guided modes in
the ﬁnite crystal of plane scatterers, all modes corre-
sponding to s-polarized light. The comparison of the
single plane and the single slab indicates that s-waves in
plane scatterers are a good model for s-waves in slabs, at
least for frequencies around the ﬁrst stopband. For the
p-polarized guided modes, the conclusion must be that in
the ﬁnite slab structures there are guided modes which
have no analogues in the crystal of plane scatterers.

V. SPONTANEOUS EMISSION

A. Application to layered dielectrics

In free space, the spontaneous-emission rate Γ0 of an
atom with dipole moment µ and transition frequency Ω
equals µ2Ω3/(3π~ε0c3). When embedded in an inhomo-
geneous dielectric, the rate Γ will in general be diﬀerent,
as can be found with Fermi’s golden rule [39]

(46)

·

(See [40] for early derivations of this relation; in [41] a
modern derivation is given for inhomogeneous and ab-
sorbing dielectric media.) In Eq. (46), G is the classi-
cal dyadic Green function of the electric-ﬁeld wave equa-
tion (4). For homogeneous dielectrics, it is known that
the total Green function is the sum of a transverse part
that describes radiative decay and a longitudinal part de-
scribing nonradiative decay [42]. Here, the Eqs. (45) and
(46) are equivalent, because nonradiative decay is absent
for dielectrics with real dielectric functions.

Layered dielectrics (not necessarily plane scatterers)
are translation invariant in two directions, which can

12

be chosen to be the ( ˆx, ˆy) directions.
Spontaneous-
emission rates will only depend on the z-coordinate of
the atomic position R = (x, y, z). It is then easiest to
ﬁrst calculate the Green function in the plane representa-
tion G(kk, z, z, Ω). This Green function must be Fourier
transformed back to real space as in Eq. (40) in order to
ﬁnd the local Green function of Eq. (46) that determines
spontaneous-emission rates.

A slight complication in doing the integration (40)
is that the plane representation for G(kk, z, z, Ω) is co-
rotating with the incoming wave vector kk, a variable
ˆx, ˆy, ˆz
that must now be integrated over. A ﬁxed basis
}
is needed instead and it is chosen such that the atomic
dipole becomes (µx, 0, µz) in the new representation.

(Green-function arguments
(kk, z, z, Ω) were again
dropped.) The parallel decay rate has a contribution
both from s- and p-polarized light (through Gss and Gvv,
respectively) whereas the perpendicular decay rate only
has a p-polarized decay channel (through Gzz). Notice
that the (real) delta-function term in Gzz
0 does not play
a role in the emission rates. The spontaneous-emission
rates in Eq. (47a) and (47b) are integrals over all possible
lengths of the in-plane wave vector. Both rates can be
subdivided into a propagating-mode (or radiative-mode)
rate corresponding to the integration of kk from 0 to Ω/c,
and a guided-mode rate which is the integral from Ω/c
to inﬁnity.

B. Spontaneous emission near plane scatterers

The general expressions obtained in Sec. V A for spon-
taneous emission in layered structures will now be ap-
plied to crystals of plane scatterers. Combine the gen-
eral expressions (47) for spontaneous-emission rates in
layered dielectrics with the Green functions in the plane
representation that were determined in Eq. (41) for a
crystal of plane scatterers. Because of the absence of
p-polarized guided modes, the parallel decay rate near
plane scatterers can be subdivided into three (instead of
four) parts: an s-polarized radiative-mode rate (sr), a
p-polarized radiative-mode rate (pr), and an s-polarized
guided-mode rate (sg). Again, because of the absence of
p-polarized guided modes, the perpendicular decay rate
Γz is purely radiative. Here is a list of the nonzero partial

decay rates:

To be precise, in Eq. (48d) it was used that the ten-
sor element Gzz has a vanishing imaginary part (leading
to a vanishing contribution to the density of states) for
kk > Ω/c; for the same reason, there is no guided-mode
rate analogous to Eq. (48c) corresponding to Gvv. These
properties were found in Sec. IV B.

With all partial emission rates spelled out now, we ﬁrst
study spontaneous-emission rates near a single plane, for
which the Green function in the plane representation
(41) features the single-plane T-matrix of Eq. (28). In
Fig. 4(a), spontaneous-emission rates as a function of po-
sition are plotted for Deﬀ = 0.46a. For both orientations
of the dipole, far away from the plane the rate approaches
the free-space value. Close to the plane, Γx is larger than
Γ0, but it consists of a rate into propagating modes that
is less than Γ0, and a guided-mode rate. Close to the
plane, Γz is larger than Γ0, but the maximal values of
(the purely radiative) Γz occur somewhat away from the
plane.

The contribution of radiative and guided s-waves for
an atom with µ = µx is the same as for scalar waves with
“scalar dipole moment” µ, but since the total decay rate
Γ0 for vector waves is larger than for scalar waves, the
relative contributions of s-waves to Γ/Γ0 are smaller for
vector waves (by a factor 3/4).

In Fig. 4(b), the same rates are plotted, this time for a
plane with Deﬀ = 10a that reﬂects light almost ideally:
near the plane, Γz is almost twice Γ0. The maximum
values of Γz still occur away from the plane, although
this has become invisible in Fig. 4(b). The propagating-
mode part of Γx has decreased and is practically zero on
the plane. The partial emission rate into the guided mode
has a much larger (but ﬁnite, not shown) amplitude near
the plane. The other prominent diﬀerence in the two
ﬁgures is that the ‘spike’ in the emission rates due to the
guided modes has become much narrower. Indeed, from
Eqs. (39-41), it follows that the guided-mode rate decays
2κ(1)
exponentially away from the plane like exp(
).

It follows from the dispersion relation for κ(1)
that was

In the limit that the atomic position z becomes equal
to the plane position zα = 0, the spontaneous-emission
rates can be calculated analytically for both dipole ori-

In Fig. 5 the relative rates are plotted as a function of ξ.
The results can be checked in two limiting cases: if Deﬀ =
0 there is no plane and then indeed both Γz and Γx are
equal to the free-space value Γ0. The other limit is that
of a perfect mirror, when Deﬀ (and consequently ξ) is
sent to inﬁnity. This limit is not visible in the ﬁgure, but
the limiting values are Γz/Γ0 = 2 and Γx/Γ0 = 0. These
values indeed agree with the well-known emission rates
for atoms near perfect mirrors [21, 22, 23]. Emission rates
into guided modes vanish in the perfect-mirror limit; at
z = zα this is only the case by sending Deﬀ to inﬁnity
before putting z equal to zα = 0. This completes the
discussion of emission rates near a single plane.

Now consider emission rates inside and near a crystal
of a number N of plane scatterers. Results will be pre-
sented for N = 10. In Fig. 6(a-d), orientation-dependent
spontaneous-emission rates are plotted for several fre-
quencies. For clarity in the pictures, the positions of the
planes at a, 2a, ..., 10a are not shown as vertical lines this
time. The most striking diﬀerence between Γx and Γz
is that Γx becomes very spiky near the planes, because
only parallel dipoles can couple to the s-polarized guided
modes (and because p-polarized guided modes are absent
in our model).

As the frequency increases when going from Fig. 6(a)
to Fig. 6(d), Γx becomes more spiky, because the partial
emission rate into the guided modes (the diﬀerence be-
tween the solid and the dotted lines in Fig. 6) becomes
more concentrated near the planes. The term ‘concentra-
tion’ is appropriate here, because the maximum ampli-
tudes near the planes are higher for narrower spikes. The
same eﬀect was observed for the single plane in Fig. 4(a-
b), where the frequency is kept constant and Deﬀ is in-
creased instead.

The purely radiative-mode rate Γz on average increases
due to the presence of the planes, whereas the radiative
part of Γx on average decreases. The same behavior oc-
curs near a single plane in Fig. 4 and for a perfect mirror.
Figure 1 showed that the optical modes of p-polarized
light have discontinuities at the plane positions. There
are also discontinuities in the spontaneous-emission rates
(not for a single plane, for symmetry reasons), but these

are too small to be visible in Fig. 6. It can be understood
that they are small from the fact that the discontinuities
per mode are averaged in the emission rate.

The dotted lines in Fig. 6 are the radiative parts of
Γx. These are similar to the radiative-mode rates for
scalar waves [5], but not identical, since in Γx not only
s-polarized but also p-polarized light contributes, accord-
ing to Eq. (47b). In particular, far away from the planes,
the emission rate of dipoles parallel to the planes con-
sists of 75% s-polarized and 25% p-polarized light. (To
be sure, light emitted by perpendicular dipoles is 100%
p-polarized for all layered dielectrics, see Eq. (47a).)

For ‘large enough’ photonic crystals, one expects in-
ner unit cells to have optical properties similar to unit

cells in the inﬁnite crystal. Are the ten-plane crystals
large enough? This depends on the properties of a single
plane.
In two extreme cases, the crystal size does not
matter: when the individual planes do not reﬂect any
light in any direction (Deﬀ/a = 0), or when they reﬂect
all light (Deﬀ /a =
), one ﬁnds the same emission rates
in ﬁnite and in inﬁnite crystals, because for Deﬀ/a = 0
we have the free-space case and for Deﬀ/a =
all unit
cells are optically disconnected. Only in intermediate
cases (0 < Deﬀ/a <
) can ﬁnite photonic crystals
have an appreciable and unit-cell dependent inﬂuence on
spontaneous-emission rates.

∞

∞

∞

In the intermediate cases (we assumed Deﬀ/a = 0.46),
the single-plane reﬂection also depends on the frequency
of the light. The planes reﬂect light better at higher
frequencies, because material dispersion was neglected.
It appears that for the lowest frequency considered in
Fig. 6, a/λ = 0.2 in (a), the emission rates in inner unit
cells already are inﬂuenced considerably by the crystal.
The rates vary in neighboring inner unit cells, which indi-
cates that the rates have not yet converged to the inﬁnite-
crystal values. For higher frequencies, say a/λ = 0.6,
individual planes reﬂect light much better. In the cor-
responding Fig. 6(d), all inner unit cells look alike and
emission rates have converged.

Now consider a parallel dipole at a ﬁxed position, very
close to a plane in an inner unit cell. From Fig. 6, one
can also appreciate how the guided modes will inﬂuence
the (frequency-dependent) emission rate of a dipole very
close to a plane. For frequencies a/λ = 0.4 and higher,
Figs. 6(b-d) show that emission into propagating modes
modes is negligible compared to emission into guided
modes. The dipole falls inside the guided-mode spike
near the plane. As the frequency increases, the maxi-
mum amplitude of the spike increases. With the dipole
still well inside the spike, the emission rate of the dipole
will increase as well. When increasing the frequency fur-
ther, the spike becomes so narrow that the dipole ends

up in one of the wings of the spike, until the dipole ﬁnds
itself completely outside it. This will cause the emission
rates into guided modes to drop at higher frequencies.
The combined eﬀect is a peak in the frequency-dependent
emission rates. Indeed, in [19] the dipole emission rate (or
more precisely, its s-wave component) for inﬁnite crystals
as a function of frequency shows a pronounced peak for
dipole positions z near a plane (see Fig. 3 in [19]). We
can unambiguously attribute this peak to emission into
the guided modes.

We can also understand how an emission peak will de-
pend on Deﬀ and on the distance to the plane. We have
seen that spikes are narrower, with higher amplitudes, for
larger Deﬀ and for higher frequencies. When assuming
larger Deﬀ , a dipole at ﬁxed distance will feel a guided-
mode enhanced emission rate for lower frequencies. How-
ever, the dipole will also at lower frequencies begin to fall
outside the range of the spike. This explains why for ﬁxed
dipole position and increased Deﬀ , the emission peak has
a larger amplitude and attains its maximum at a lower
frequency, precisely as seen in Fig. 3 in [19]. Similar rea-
soning suggests that for a parallel dipole a bit further
away from a plane but still close to it (while keeping Deﬀ
ﬁxed), an emission peak will occur at lower frequencies,
with lower amplitude.

What can be appreciated best in Fig. 6(a) is that for
parallel dipoles the total emission rate converges faster

than the radiative and guided-mode partial rates sepa-
rately. This can be related to a kind of mode competi-
tion between s-polarized propagating and guided modes
that we also found for scalar waves [5]. On the other
hand, for perpendicular dipoles all emission is into ra-
diative modes, so mode competition is absent there and
convergence sets in earlier.

For scalar waves the ten-plane structure could act as
an omnidirectional mirror, whereas in Sec. IV A it was
found that it is not an omnidirectional mirror for vec-
tor waves. Correspondingly, the radiative-mode LDOS
for scalar waves at a/λ = 0.5 dropped down to (almost)
zero inside the ten-plane omnidirectional mirror, whereas
the emission rates in Fig. 6(c) show that the radiative
LDOS for vector waves stays nonzero inside the crystal.
In the inner unit cells, dipoles parallel to the planes emit
predominantly guided light. The small amount of light
that leaves the structure is strongly p-polarized. This
is the case around a/λ = 0.5 only, where s-polarized
light is omnidirectionally reﬂected. Such strongly polar-
ized emission is not a peculiarity of the plane-scatterer
model, because it will also occur for a real Bragg mirror
whenever light of only one of the two polarization direc-

tions is omnidirectionally reﬂected.
in Fig. 6 for higher and lower frequencies, the radiative-
mode parts of Γx are the sums of emission rates into both
polarization directions.

VI. CONCLUSIONS, DISCUSSION, AND
OUTLOOK

A theory was set up for the multiple scattering of vec-
tor waves by parallel planes, thereby generalizing pre-
vious work for scalar waves to the more interesting but
also more complicated case of light waves. Unlike for
scalar waves, the Green function had to be regularized.
This was accomplished by introducing a high-momentum
cutoﬀ. An eﬀective scattering theory emerged with a
nonzero T-matrix that no longer depends on the cutoﬀ.
The T-matrix and Green-function formalism turned out
to be very convenient for the calculation of propagating
and guided modes, as well as spontaneous-emission rates,
of ﬁnite photonic crystals of plane scatterers.

A non-absorbing plane scatterer satisﬁes a separate op-
tical theorem for s- and p-polarized light. The radiative
and guided modes of s-polarized light could be mapped
onto modes for scalar waves. The s-polarized light has
continuous modes, whereas p-polarized modes have dis-
continuities at the plane positions.

Throughout the paper, we have stressed the similarities
and diﬀerences of optical properties of a plane scatterer
or a crystal of plane scatterers as compared to the cor-
responding dielectric slab structures. It turns out that
p-polarized waves diﬀer more in the two cases than s-
polarized waves. Firstly, because propagating p-polarized
modes are diﬀerent in the two cases because the Brewster
angle is 90◦ for plane scatterers. Secondly, p-polarized
guided modes in ﬁnite slab structures have no analogues
for plane scatterers. This was also found in [15] for the
single plane and in [15, 20] for the inﬁnite crystal.

Unlike for scalar waves, equidistant and identical plane
scatterers can not be an omnidirectional mirror for all
vector waves. Such omnidirectional mirrors consisting of
dielectric layers do exist. For layered media, at least three
refractive indices are required in order to prevent com-
plete transmission of p-polarized light in the Brewster-
angle direction [3, 4, 43].

Omnidirectional reﬂection is a property of a dielectric
for external light sources. In this paper, omnidirectional
reﬂection could be related to the emission properties of
atomic light sources from within the ﬁnite crystals. The
graphs of emission rates (Fig. 6) show that the emission
by dipoles oriented parallel to the planes is aﬀected much
more strongly by the planes than emission by perpendicu-
lar dipoles. This is a characteristic of the plane-scatterer
model, because the absence of p-polarized guided modes
is responsible for much of the diﬀerence. In the frequency
interval where s-polarized light is omnidirectionally re-
ﬂected, all light that exits the crystal after a spontaneous-
emission process will be p-polarized, irrespective of the
orientation of the emitters. Still, the major fraction of
the light will be emitted into guided modes and stay in-
side the crystal.

For low frequencies, the single-plane reﬂectivity is
lower, emission rates are less aﬀected by the crystal, and
ﬁnite-size eﬀects are appreciable also in the inner unit

16

cells of the ten-plane crystal. For higher frequencies,
planes reﬂect light better and emission rates are more
strongly modiﬁed. In the inner unit cells, the emission
rates converge faster to the values of the unit cell of an in-
ﬁnite crystal. If the inﬁnite crystal has larger variations
in the emission rates inside a unit cell, then a smaller
ﬁnite crystal is needed to converge to this result.

We argued that the guided modes will give rise to a
peak in the frequency-dependent emission rate of a par-
allel dipole close to a plane. We also reasoned that the
peak will shrink and shift to lower frequencies when ei-
ther the eﬀective thickness or the distance to the plane
is increased.
Indeed, the occurrence of a peak and its
dependence on the eﬀective thickness agree with numer-
ical calculations on inﬁnite crystals in [19]; some more
numerical work is needed to corroborate our prediction
of the distance dependence.

What other purposes can plane scatterers serve in the
future? The ﬁnite photonic crystals that can be made
with them have one-dimensional periodicity only, yet
light propagation in all three dimensions for all polar-
ization directions is properly taken into account. The
number of planes can be chosen at will and further advan-
tages are that all optical modes and the complete Green
tensor can be determined.

Our calculations can be extended to situations where
not al planes are identical; or one could allow light ab-
sorption or gain in the planes by giving the eﬀective
thickness a complex value; the number of planes per unit
cell could also be increased to more than one. Such cal-
culations are possible in our formalism because the re-
sults (34) and (35) for the T-matrix were generalized
in Eq. (56) of the Appendix to planes chosen at arbi-
trary positions, each with a diﬀerent T-matrix Tα(kk, ω),
in other words with a diﬀerent eﬀective thickness. The
model can therefore also be used to study the eﬀects of
disorder in the positions or in the optical properties of
the planes on the spontaneous-emission rates of embed-
ded atoms.

It would also be interesting to study models of ﬁnite
photonic crystals built up of non-parallel planes. This
can be done, but numerically the model would become
more involved, not so much because the planes have an
overlap of measure zero, but rather because the plane
representations for nonparallel planes will be diﬀerent.
Numerical calculations for nonparallel planes require the
discretization of individual planes.

Apart from extending it, one can extract other inter-
esting observables from the model. For example, the
knowledge of the complete Green function makes it pos-
sible to calculate both far-ﬁeld and near-ﬁeld spectra of
atoms embedded in the ﬁnite crystal.
It would be in-
teresting to study spectra near frequencies where the
corresponding inﬁnite crystal gives rise to a Van Hove
singularity in the emission rates [20]. Crystals of plane
scatterers can serve as a model environment to study the
modiﬁcation of several quantum optical processes when
atoms are embedded in photonic crystals. Transient ef-

17

fects in the spontaneous-emission rates are but one exam-
ple, thereby generalizing work done on a one-dimensional
cavity formed by two planes [44]. Calculations are under-
way that show photonic-crystal induced modiﬁcations of
cooperative atomic processes.

APPENDIX: DERIVATION OF N-PLANE
T-MATRIX

The goal of this appendix is to derive the expres-
sions (34-35) for the N -plane T-matrix T (N ), by sum-
ming the inﬁnite series in Eq. (12), where the Tα are the
T-matrices of single planes:

The Tα(kk, ω) are 3
3 tensors, deﬁned in Eq. (28). First
allow all planes to have diﬀerent Tα(kk, ω); furthermore,
allow the parallel planes to have arbitrary (but all diﬀer-
ent) positions zα.

The ﬁrst-order term in the expansion (12) is simply

in the plane representation, the Green tensor has the
form as derived in Sec. III A, and the single-plane T-
matrices Tα(kk, ω) have the simple form as deﬁned in
Eq. (28), with only T ss
α nonzero. It follows that
Dαβ, D2
αβ, and all higher powers of D have only three
nonzero spatial components, namely the ss-, vv-, and
the zv-components. As a consequence, T(N )
αβ (kk, ω) has
only two nonzero spatial components for all plane indices
α and β, namely the ss- and vv-component:

This generalizes the result of Eq. (28) for the single-plane
T-matrices Tα, where the same two components were
found to be nonzero. The generalization is from one plane
to N parallel planes placed at arbitrary positions, each
plane possibly with a diﬀerent eﬀective thickness. In the
special case considered in the main text that all planes
are identical, in other words if all Tα(kk, ω) are equal,
then Eq. (56) simpliﬁes into Eq. (35).

Abstract: We consider the eﬀective area Aeﬀ of photonic crystal ﬁbers
(PCFs) with a triangular air-hole lattice in the cladding. It is ﬁrst
of all an important quantity in the context of non-linearities, but it
also has connections to leakage loss, macro-bending loss, and numerical
aperture. Single-mode versus multi-mode operation in PCFs can also
be studied by comparing eﬀective areas of the diﬀerent modes. We
report extensive numerical studies of PCFs with varying air hole size.
Our results can be scaled to a given pitch and thus provide a general
map of the eﬀective area. We also use the concept of eﬀective area to
calculate the “phase” boundary between the regimes with single-mode
and multi-mode operation.

1 Introduction

Photonic crystal ﬁbers (PCF) constitute a new class of optical ﬁbers which has revealed
many surprising phenomena and also has a big potential from an application point of
view (for recent special issues on photonic crystal ﬁbers, see e.g. Refs. [1, 2]). Here we
consider the type of PCF ﬁrst studied in Ref. [3, 4] which consists of pure silica with a
cladding with air-holes of diameter d arranged in a triangular lattice with pitch Λ, see
Fig. 1. For a review of the basic operation we refer to Ref. [5].

The eﬀective area is a quantity of great importance. It was originally introduced as
a measure of non-linearities; a low eﬀective area gives a high density of power needed
for non-linear eﬀects to be signiﬁcant [6]. However, the eﬀective area can of course also
be related to the spot-size w through Aeﬀ = πw2, and thus it is also important in
the context of conﬁnement loss [10], micro-bending loss [11], macro-bending loss [12],
splicing loss [13], and numerical aperture [14].

Strictly endlessly single-mode operation of PCFs [15] is possible for d < d∗ ∼ 0.45Λ
[5], but even for larger air holes single-mode operation is possible for wavelengths above
a certain cut-oﬀ λ∗. We demonstrate that the eﬀective area of the second-order mode
is a useful concept in determining this cut-oﬀ for a given hole size d. For d < d∗ we
recover the endlessly single-mode regime with λ∗ → 0.

The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we introduce the concept of the eﬀective
area and In Sec. III we report numerical results for PCFs of the type shown in Fig. 1.
Finally, discussion and conclusions are given.

2 Eigen-modes and eﬀective areas

We consider PCFs realized in dielectric materials with no free charges or currents. From
Maxwell’s equations it then follows that the H-ﬁeld is governed by the general wave
equation (see e.g. Ref. [16])

∇ ×

ε(r)∇ × H ω(r)
i
h

= (ω/c)2H ω(r)

where ε is the dielectric function and ω is the frequency of the harmonic mode, H ω(r, t) =
H ω(r)e±iωt.

The PCF has translation symmetry along the ﬁber axis (z-axis) and for ε(r) = ε(r⊥)

the solution is of the form

H ω(r) =

αnhn(r⊥)e±iβn(ω)z

Xn

where hn is the transverse part of the nth eigen-mode and βn is the corresponding
propagation constant at frequency ω. Often one will specify the free-space wavelength
λ rather than the frequency ω = c(2π/λ).

The eﬀective area associated with the nth eigen-mode is given by [6]

Aeﬀ,n(λ) =

dr⊥In(r⊥)
i

. Z

h Z

dr⊥I 2

n(r⊥),

where In(r⊥) = |hn(r⊥)|2 is the intensity distribution. It is easy to show that for a
Gaussian mode h(r⊥) ∝ e−(r⊥/w)
of width w the eﬀective area is Aeﬀ = πw2. Applying
Eq. (3) to close-to-Gaussian modes in some way corresponds to a Gaussian ﬁt averaged
over all angular directions. In Fig. 2 we illustrate this by an example. For d/Λ = 0.3
and λ/Λ = 0.48 we compare the intensity I of the fundamental mode (n = 1 or 2) to
the intensity IG of the corresponding Gaussian with the width calculated from Aeﬀ . As
seen the over-all intensity distribution is reasonably described by the Gaussian with a
width calculated from the eﬀective area.

The low-intensity deviations from a Gaussian intensity distribution are coursed by
the six-fold symmetry of the air hole lattice; the ﬁeld extends slightly into the six silica
bridges formed by the six holes nearest to the core. Similar modal properties have been
found experimentally, see e.g. Refs. [3, 7, 8].

Below we mention a few examples of some of the diﬀerent phenomena and quantities
which can be at least partly quantiﬁed from knowledge of the eﬀective area; the non-
linearity coeﬃcient, the numerical aperture, the macro-bending loss coeﬃcient, and
splicing loss. In Sec. III we also discuss how a second-order mode cut-oﬀ can be identiﬁed
using the concept of the eﬀective area.

2.1 Non-linearity coeﬃcient

The non-linearity coeﬃcient γ is given by [6]

γ =

n2ω
cAeﬀ

=

n22π
λAeﬀ

(4)

where n2 is the nonlinear-index coeﬃcient in the nonlinear part of the refractive index,
δn = n2|E|2. Knowledge of Aeﬀ is thus an important starting point in the understanding
of non-linear phenomena in PCFs. Due to the high index contrast between silica and

Fig. 2. Comparison of the real intensity I(r⊥) to the Gaussian intensity IG(r⊥)
with a width obtained from Aeﬀ . The upper left panel shows IG/I, the upper right
panel shows I, the lower right panel shows IG, and the lower left panel shows the
dielectric function ε with d/Λ = 0.3. The ﬁelds are calculated at λ/Λ = 0.48.

air the PCF technology oﬀers the possibility of a much tighter mode conﬁnement (over
a wide wavelength range) and thereby a lower eﬀective area compared to standard-ﬁber
technology. Furthermore, the microstructured cladding of the PCFs also allows for zero-
dispersion engineering. For a recent demonstration of a highly nonlinear PCF with a
zero-dispersion at λ = 1.55 µm see Ref. [9].

2.2 Numerical aperture

Also the numerical aperture (NA) relates to the eﬀective area. For a Gaussian ﬁeld
of width w one has the standard approximate expression tan θ ≃ λ/πw for the half-

divergence angle θ of the light radiated from the end-facet of the ﬁber [17]. The corre-
sponding numerical aperture can then be expressed as

In Ref. [14] this was used in a study of the numerical aperture of PCFs.

NA = sin θ ≃

1 + πAeﬀ /λ2

.

2.3 Macro-bending loss

For estimation of the macro-bending loss coeﬃcient α the Sakai–Kimura formula [18]
can be applied to PCFs. This involves an evaluation of the ratio A2
e/P , where Ae
is the amplitude coeﬃcient of the ﬁeld in the cladding and P the power carried by
the fundamental mode. The Gaussian approximation gives A2
e/P = 1/Aeﬀ [19] and in
Ref. [12] this was used to calculate the macro-bending loss in PCFs based on fully-
vectorial eigenmodes of Maxwell’s equations.

2.4 Splicing loss

Also splicing loss can be quantiﬁed in terms of the concepts of eﬀective areas. The
splicing of two aligned ﬁbers with eﬀective areas Aeﬀ,1 and Aeﬀ,2 will have a power
transmission coeﬃcient T < 1 given approximately by

(5)

(6)

T ≈

4Aeﬀ,1Aeﬀ,2
(Aeﬀ,1 + Aeﬀ,2)2

due to the mismatch of eﬀective areas.

3 Numerical results

We solve Eq. (1) numerically and from the eigenmodes we calculate the corresponding
eﬀective area from Eq. (3). The fully-vectorial eigenmodes of Maxwell’s equations are
computed with periodic boundary conditions in a planewave basis [20]. This approach
provides the eigenmodes on a discrete lattice and the integrals in Eq. (3) are then
obtained by sums over lattice sites inside the super-cell. For the dielectric function we
have used ε = 1 for the air holes and ε = (1.444)2 = 2.085 for the silica. Ignoring the
frequency dependence of the latter the wave equation, Eq. (1) becomes scale-invariant
[16] and all the results to be presented can thus be scaled to the desired value of Λ.

3.1 Fundamental mode

In Fig. 3 we show the eﬀective area of the fundamental mode as a function of wavelength
for diﬀerent hole sizes. As expected the mode becomes more conﬁned – lower eﬀective
area – for increasing air hole size. In general we ﬁnd that the eﬀective area of the
fundamental mode is of the order of Λ2 with a prefactor which depends slightly on the
air hole size. In fact, scaling the results by a factor d/Λ we ﬁnd numerical evidence that

Aeﬀ ∝ (Λ/d) × Λ2 + O(λ/d),

(7)

and as demonstrated in the lower panel of Fig. 3 the prefactor is of order 0.5.

Fig. 3 is a general “map” of the eﬀective area which can be used in calculating
the diﬀerent quantities discussed in Sec. II as well as for designing single-mode PCFs
with speciﬁed modal properties. If for example the value of d/Λ is given (which is
often the case during stack-and-pull production of PCFs) a given eﬀective area can be

obtained by scaling the ﬁber structure, i.e. the pitch Λ. The Corning SMF28 standard
ﬁber has an eﬀective area Aeﬀ ∼ 86 µm2 at λ = 1550 nm and Fig. 3 suggests that a
comparable eﬀective area can be realized by the PCF technology using e.g. d/Λ ∼ 0.25
and Λ ∼ 6.5 µm.

3.2 Second-order mode

In Fig. 4 we show a calculation of the eﬀective area of the second-order mode (n = 3) for
a PCF with d/Λ = 0.5 air holes. For short wavelengths the eﬀective area is of the order
Λ2 with the mode conﬁned to the core of the PCF. At long wavelengths the eﬀective
area diverges corresponding to a delocalized cladding mode. Even though the transition

to a cladding mode is not abrupt the high slope of the eﬀective area allows for a rather
accurate introduction of a cut-oﬀ wavelength λ∗. This cut-oﬀ wavelength is indicated
by the crossing of the dashed line with the horizontal axis.

3.3 Single-mode versus multi-mode operation

Conditions for single-mode operation of PCFs turn out to be very diﬀerent from stan-
dard ﬁber technology and for not too big air holes, d < d∗, they can even be endlessly
single-mode [3]. The reason is that the eﬀective cladding index has a wavelength depen-
dence which prevents the core from guidance of higher-order modes while still guiding
a fundamental mode. In Ref. [5] d∗ ∼ 0.45Λ was suggested from standard-ﬁber consid-
erations.

For d > d∗ a second-order mode is guided for wavelengths shorter than a certain
cut-oﬀ and above this cut-oﬀ the PCF is single-mode. This cut-oﬀ of the second-order
mode can be found from studies of the corresponding eﬀective area; below the cut-oﬀ
the eﬀective area Aeﬀ,3 is ﬁnite and comparable to Λ2 and above the cut-oﬀ the eﬀective
area diverges (in a super-cell calculation it approaches the area of the super-cell).

Comparing Fig. 4 to Fig. 3 for d/Λ = 0.5 it is seen how we for wavelengths shorter
than λ∗ ∼ 0.35Λ have a multi-mode PCF whereas the PCF is in the single-mode regime
for λ > λ∗. Carrying out the same analysis for diﬀerent hole-sizes allows for constructing
a “phase” diagram, see Fig. 5. The data points indicate calculated cut-oﬀ wavelengths
and the solid line is a ﬁt to the function

f (x) = α(x − x0)β, x0 = 0.45,

(8)

with the ﬁtting coeﬃcients α ≃ 1.34 and β ≃ 0.45.

The solid line deﬁnes a “phase” boundary; above the line the PCF is single-mode
and below it is multi-mode. Furthermore there is an endlessly single-mode regime for

Fig. 4. The eﬀective area of the second-order mode for d/Λ = 0.5. For short wave-
lengths Aeﬀ,3 ∼ Λ2 and the mode is guided in the core. For high wavelengths
the mode becomes a cladding mode with eﬀective area approaching the area of the
super-cell used in the calculation. The crossing of the dashed line with the horizontal
axis indicates the cut-oﬀ for the second order mode.

d < d∗ ∼ 0.45Λ [5]. In principle the eﬀective area approach allows for an independent
determination of d∗ but it should be emphasized that the numerical eﬀorts needed to
resolve the cut-oﬀ increase dramatically when d approaches d∗.

4 Conclusion

We have considered the eﬀective area Aeﬀ of photonic crystal ﬁbers (PCFs) with a
triangular air-hole lattice in the cladding. Based on extensive numerical studies of PCFs
with varying air hole size we have constructed a map of the eﬀective area which can be
scaled to a desired value of the pitch. We have also utilized the concept of eﬀective area to
calculate the “phase” boundary between the regimes with single-mode and multi-mode
operation. In this work we have studied PCFs with a triangular air-hole lattice cladding,
but we emphasize that the approach applies to microstructured ﬁbers in general.

Light emission from a dielectric cavity with a stadium shape is studied in both ray and wave
models. For a passive cavity mode with low loss, a remarkable correspondence is found between the
phase space representation of a quasi-bound wavefunction and its counterpart distribution in the ray
model. This result provides additional and more direct evidence for good ray-wave correspondence
in low-loss modes previously observed at the level of far-ﬁeld emission pattern comparisons.

Directional lasing emission is one of the most high-
lighted features of two-dimensional microcavity lasers [1].
In interpreting the appearance of emission directional-
ity and its dependence on cavity shape, a ray dynam-

standard version of the ray model, Frenel’s law is ap-
plied to describe the light emission process from a cavity
without its application being fully justiﬁed; Frenel’s law
is usually derived when a plane wave is scattered at a
planer dielectric interface. For a cavity shape obeying
integrable ray dynamics, one can approximately make
a connection between the ray picture based on Frenel’s
law and wave solutions in the short-wavelength limit by
using the Eikonal method [7]. Besides, even for a nonin-
tegrable cavity, one can associate its stable ray trajectory
(if it exists) to a class of wave solutions by the Gaussian-
optical method [8]. For a fully chaotic cavity, however,
one lacks a method to relate ray trajectories with wave
solutions. Whereas establishing ray-wave (or classical-
quantum) correspondence in closed chaotic systems has
been very matured in the ﬁeld of quantum chaos [9], it is
still an ongoing issue to make such a correspondence in
“open” systems [10], one of which being dielectric micro-
cavities.

In this Letter, we present numerical evidence showing
that for a fully chaotic cavity, there is signiﬁcant cor-
respondence between ray dynamics and solutions of the
Helmholtz equation, although we currently lack justiﬁca-
tion for applying the ray model to a fully chaotic cavity.
We consider a stadium-shaped cavity as shown in the in-
set of Fig. 1, whose internal ray dynamics is known to
become fully chaotic [11]. Stadium-shaped cavities have
actually been fabricated using materials such as semi-
conductors [4] and polymers [6], and stable lasing has
been experimentally conﬁrmed in both materials. In par-
ticular, for polymer cavities (refractive index n
1.5),
the ray model predicts highly directional light emission,
which can be associated with the unstable manifolds of
a short periodic trajectory of the stadium cavity [3, 12].
This highly directional emission has been experimentally
observed, and systematic agreement between experimen-

≈

tal far-ﬁeld patterns and those obtained from the ray
model has been reported in Ref. [6]. Moreover, in recent
work, we employed a nonlinear lasing model based on the
Maxwell-Bloch equations [13] to numerically simulate the
lasing of polymer stadium cavities and successfully ob-
tained a highly directional far-ﬁeld emission pattern that
agrees with the ray model’s prediction [12]. The analysis
of the passive cavity modes relevant for lasing revealed
that each of the low-loss (or high-Q) modes exhibits the
far-ﬁeld emission pattern closely corresponding to the ray
model’s results. The present work provides more direct
and clearer evidence for this ray-wave correspondence by
showing that the phase space representation of wavefunc-
tions reproduces the ray model’s distribution formed by
the stretching and folding mechanisms of ray chaos.

As a method to relate a wavefunction with ray dynam-
ics, the Husimi phase space distribution is often used
[5, 14, 15, 16]. To accord with the deﬁnition of the
phase space for the ray model, where only the collisions
with the boundary with outgoing momentum are taken
it is appropriate to decompose a wave-
into account,
function into radially incoming and outgoing components
and then project the latter onto the phase space. Such
decomposition has been implemented by using the ex-
pansion in terms of the Hankel functions [15], which is,
however, only suited for a cavity shape slightly deformed
from a circle. Hence, here we introduce a diﬀerent phase
space distribution that can be formally related with the
ray model’s distribution and directly calculated from the
wavefunction and its normal derivative at the boundary.

First, we introduce a ray model incorporating Frenel’s
law. In what follows, we ﬁx the refractive indices inside
and outside the cavity as nin = 1.5 and nout = 1.0, re-
spectively, and restrict our attention to TM polarization.
Inside the cavity, we regard the dynamics of a ray as a
point particle that moves freely except for bounces at the
cavity boundary satisfying the law of reﬂection. We as-
sign a ray trajectory a variable ε(t) representing intensity
at time t, where t is measured by trajectory length in real
space. Due to the collision with the boundary at time t,
ε(t−), where t−
the ray intensity changes as ε(t+) =

φt are incident and transmission angles related by Snell’s
law nin sin φ = nout sin φt. Since we do not consider any
pumping eﬀect, ε(t) is a monotonically decreasing func-
tion.

Ray dynamics can be reduced to a two-dimensional
area-preserving mapping on the phase space deﬁned by
the Birkhoﬀ coordinates (s, p), where s is the curvilinear
coordinate along the cavity boundary and p = sin φ is
the tangential momentum along the boundary. The in-
tensity leakage at the cavity boundary creates an “open
window” in the momentum space: Whenever a ray tra-

We assume that initially rays are distributed uniformly
over the phase space having identical intensities. To
study the statistical properties of the ray model, we fo-
cus upon a time-independent distribution P (s, p) that de-
scribes intensity ﬂux at the cavity boundary. The useful-
ness of studying this distribution has been demonstrated
in Refs.
[12, 16, 18]. Below we deﬁne this distribution
for the ray model and later derive the corresponding dis-
tribution for the wave model.

We denote the light intensity inside the cavity as

P (s, p) describes how the rays’ intensities are transmit-
ted outside the cavity and becomes important when try-
ing to understand the relation between emission direc-
tionality and the phase space structures of ray dynamics
[3, 12, 16]. Figure 2 (a) shows a numerically obtained dis-
tribution P (s, p). As explained in detail in Refs. [3, 12],
the structure of the high-intensity regions of P (s, p) can
be well ﬁtted by the unstable manifolds of a pair of un-
stable four-bounce periodic trajectories; one is located
just above critical line p = pc and the other just below
p =

Let us next treat the light ﬁeld by the Maxwell equa-
tions. For a two-dimensional cavity, the z-component
of the TM electric ﬁeld is written as Ez(x, y, t) =
Re[ψ(x, y) e−iωt], where ψ(x, y) satisﬁes the Helmholtz

tion become quasi-bound states (or resonances) char-
acterized by complex wavenumbers k = kr + iki with

light intensity decay rate γw is written as γw = 2c

Equating this with γr evaluated for the ray model, one
obtains the ray model’s estimate of the kiR value, i.e.,
0.0647, which in this case turns
kiR =
out to be larger than any of the kiR values of the reso-
nances shown in Fig. 3.

Calculating H(s, p) for all the cavity modes shown in
Fig. 3, we found that for a low-loss mode, H(s, p) is pre-
dominantly supported on the high-intensity regions of
P (s, p). We show a typical example in Fig. 2 (b), where
the momentum is rescaled as p/(ninkrR)
p to com-
pare with the ray model’s result. Figure 2 (c) shows the
distribution averaged over the 21 lowest loss modes (i.e.,
0.20). Compared to the distribu-
those with kiR >
tion for a single mode, the averaged distribution appears
to exhibit better correspondence with P (s, p). By plot-
ting these distributions in log scale as shown in Fig. 4,
one can further conﬁrm that correspondence holds not
only for high-intensity regions but also for low-intensity
regions.

periments, lasing often occurs in multi-mode, so that a
lasing state can be considered as a “superposition” of
multiple low-loss modes. The fact that better ray-wave
correspondence is obtained after the averaging over low-
loss modes as shown in Figs. 2 (c) and 4 (b) suggests

that such a superposition might enhance the ray-wave
correspondence.

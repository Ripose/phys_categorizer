This letter proposes a quasi-planar chiral resonator suitable for the design of negative refractive
index matamaterial. It is presented an analytical model for the determination of its polarizabili-
ties, and the viability of negative refraction in chiral and racemic arrangements with the proposed
inclusions is analyzed. The present analysis is expected to pave the way to the design of negative re-
fractive index matamaterials made of a single kind of inclusions feasible from standard photo-etching
techniques.

The main aim of this letter is to explore the possibil-
ity of obtaining negative refraction from a random ar-
rangement of quasi-planar chiral inclusions. Artiﬁcial bi-
isotropic chiral media made of random arrangements of
metallic chiral inclusions are known for long, after the
former works of K. Lindmann [1]. More recently in [2]
balanced (or racemic) mixtures of such type of inclusions
were proposed as a way to obtain negative refractive in-
dex metamaterials. The general conditions for negative
refraction of plane waves at the interface between ordi-
nary and chiral media were analyzed in [3], and the fo-
cusing of circularly polarized light by a chiral slab was
studied in [4]. The main advantage of chiral elements
in order to provide negative refraction is that only one
kind of inclusions is necessary to obtain negative values
of ǫ and µ. An additional advantage would come from
the application of conventional printed circuit fabrica-
tion techniques to manufacture such inclusions. For such
purpose, a quasi-planar design would be desirable.
The proposed inclusion is shown in Fig. 1.

It is the
broadside-coupled version of the two turns spiral res-
onator (2-SR) previously proposed by some of the au-
thors as a metamaterial element [5]. The analysis in that
paper shows that the proposed element can be charac-
terized by a quasi-static LC circuit, where L is the in-
ductance of a single ring with the same radius and width
as the inclusion, and C = 2πrCpul is the total capaci-
tance between the rings. However, there are two main
diﬀerences between the structure of Fig. 1 and the 2-SR
analyzed in [5]. First, due to the broadside coupling, the
distributed capacitance between the rings can be made
very large, which will reduce the electrical size of the in-
clusion near the resonance. Second, when the element is
excited near the resonance, in addition to a strong mag-
netic dipole there also appears a strong electric dipole
oriented parallel to the former one. This latter property
comes from the strong electric ﬁeld between the upper
and lower rings that appears near the resonance.

Neglecting losses, and following the analysis in [5], the
circuit equation for the total current in the element (i.e.,

FIG. 1: The proposed inclusion is formed by two identical con-
ducting rings, etched on both sides of a dielectric substrate,
and connected by a via in order to obtain an helicoidal shape.

for the sum of the currents excited on both rings, which
must be angle-independent [5]) is given by

, where t is the substrate thickness and C0 is
the total capacitance between the rings in the absence
of the dielectric substrate [6]. From such equations, the

inclusion when it is submitted to some external electric
and/or magnetic ﬁelds can be obtained:

for plane wave propagation, it would be desirable that
χe(ω) = χm(ω). According to (10) this implies that

where the sign of the square root must be chosen nega-

if κ2 >
only one of solutions of (11) can be a

refraction at the interface with an ordinary media. This
is indeed the case when (12) is satisﬁed and χe, χm, are
both negative. In such case, negative refraction will take
place for only one of the eigenmodes of (11), provided
0.5. This condition is less re-
that χe = χm =

stance, for a balanced mixture of inclusions of opposite

FIG. 2: Illustration of the negative refraction of a linearly po-
larized wave at the interface with a chiral metamaterial made
of inclusions as that shown in Fig. 1. Only one of the two
eigenwaves that can propagate in the chiral medium shows
negative refraction, and the reﬂected wave is elliptically po-
larized.

enlargement of the bandwidth is that only one of the so-
lutions of (11) shows negative refraction. Such scenario is
illustrated in Fig. 2, where an incident linearly polarized
wave is considered.

Returning now to the inclusions, it is found from (9)

that condition (12) is satisﬁed provided that

where c is the velocity of light in vacuum. In priciple,
this condition is compatible with (3)–(5). Actually, we
have tried to obtain a particular design satisfying such
condition by using the analytical expressions for L and
Cpul reported in [8]. A substrate with permittivity simi-
lar to vacuum (a foam for instance) was chosen in order
to simplify computations. With this substrate (ǫ = ǫ0) a
suitable design is: width of the strips c = 2 mm, external
radius rext = r + c/2 = 5 mm, and separation between
strips t = 2.35 mm. Following [8], the frequency of res-
onance of the proposed conﬁguration should be about
2.3 GHz. It gives an electrical size of
λ/13 for the in-
clusion, which is acceptable for a practical metamaterial
design. In order to check our analytical results, the elec-
tric and magnetic polarizabilities of the inclusions have
been numerically determined following the procedure de-
scribed in [9]. This procedure mainly consists in plac-
ing the particle inside a TEM waveguide and to com-
pute the polarizabilities from the reﬂection and trans-
mission coeﬃcients of the loaded waveguide (see [9] for
more details). The results for the meaningful quanti-
ties µ0αmm
zz/ǫ0 are shown in Fig. 3. These re-
sults clearly conﬁrms the conclusions of our analytical
model. The cross polarizations cannot be numerically de-
termined following the method described in [9]. However,

ment of chiral quasi-planar inclusions has been analyzed.
It has been proposed an speciﬁc design with the advan-
tage of being easily manufactured from standard photo-
etching techniques. Also it has been shown that such de-
sign provides the necessary behavior for all the resonant
polarizabilities in order to produce a signiﬁcant negative
refractive index bandwidth near the resonance.

and
can be shown by comparing the reﬂec-
tion coeﬃcient for the co- and the cross-polarized waves
when the particle is placed inside a metallic waveguide
of square cross-section. If the waveguide is wide enough,
so as the wave impedance approaches that of free space,
and the particle is placed with its axis perpendicular to
the waveguide walls, the equality of both reﬂection coef-
ﬁcients implies the equality of the above quantities. Nu-
merical calculations (not shown) made with the commer-
cial electromagnetic solver CST Microwave Studio con-
ﬁrms this prediction.

In order to evaluate the frequency bandwidth for neg-
ative refraction in a metamaterial made of a random ar-
rangements of the proposed inclusions, the electric sus-
ceptibility χe of such medium has been computed from
(9) with ∆ = 1. Although this approximation is rather
rough, it is clear from the general form of (9) that any
other homogenization procedure (for instance, a gener-
alized Clausius-Mossotti one) would give similar qualita-
tive results. The dimensions and characteristics of the
inclusions are those previously reported, and the number
of inclusions per unit volume is N = (12)−3 mm−3. Both
the analytical and the numerical results obtained from
the data of Fig. 3 are shown in Fig. 4. From the analysis
and the numerical results reported in the previous para-
graphs directly follows that the curves (not shown) for
the magnetic χm and the cross susceptibility κ must be
quite similar. Although some diﬀerences appear between
the analytical and numerical results shown in Fig. 4, its
qualitative agreement is apparent. In both cases a sig-
niﬁcant negative refraction frequency band appears for
both the random and the racemic mixtures. As it was
already mentioned, such frequency bands are limited by
1 respectively
the straight lines χe =

[6] The factor C0/C appears because, when a parallel-plate
capacitor is excited by a normal external ﬁeld, the elelec-
tric ﬁeld inside the capacitor is just the external one mul-
tiplied by the above factor.

[7] The inclusion also presents a non-resonant electric polar-
izability in the transverse z-plane. Since this polarizability
is almost constant with frequency, and not very large, it
can be neglected in a ﬁrst approximation.

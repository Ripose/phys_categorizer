Abstract

The Foldy-Wouthuysen iterative diagonalization technique is applied to
the Helmholtz equation to obtain a Hamiltonian description of the propaga-
tion of a monochromatic quasiparaxial light beam through a system in which
the refractive index n(x, y, z) varies about a background value n0 such that
|n(x, y, z) − n0| ≪ n0. This technique is presented as an alternative to the
conventional method of series expansion of the radical. Besides reproducing
all the traditional quasiparaxial terms, this method leads to additional terms
in the optical Hamiltonian.

1 Introduction

In the traditional scalar wave theory for treating monochromatic quasiparax-
ial light beam propagating along the positive z-axis, the z-evolution of the
optical wave function ψ(r) is taken to obey the Schr¨odinger-like equation

i¯λ

∂ψ(r)
∂z

= ˆHψ(r) ,

(1)

where ¯λ = λ/2π = c/ω. The optical Hamiltonian ˆH is formally given by the
radical

1/2

,

(cid:17)

ˆH = −

n2(r) − ˆp2
(2)
⊥
(cid:16)
where ˆp = −i¯λ∇. Then, one expands the square root in a series, with suitable
ordering, or symmetrization, of the resulting polynomials in the components
of r⊥ and ˆp⊥, if necessary, to get a Hermitian ˆH [1]-[5]. Note that n(r) and
ˆp⊥ = −i¯λ∇⊥ do not commute. Here we shall use the Foldy-Wouthuysen
(FW) iterative diagonalization procedure, well known in the treatment of
the Dirac theory of electron [6] to develop an alternative to this technique of
obtaining the optical Hamiltonian.

2 The traditional paraxial formalism

Let the system we are considering have its optic axis along the z-direction
and let the refractive index of the medium, n(r), vary by a small amount
around a background, or mean, value n0. That is, n(r) = n0 − ε(r), |ε(r)|
≪ n0, and n2
0. For a monochromatic quasiparaxial
beam, with leading z-dependence ψ(r) ∼ exp
, we have |p⊥| ≪ n0.
This means that pz ≈ n0, and that all rays propagate almost parallel to the
positive z-axis. Thus, the expansion of ˆH in the small parameters |p⊥| /n0
and ε(r)/n0 is basically an expansion in 1/n0. We have

0 − n2(r) ≈ 2n0ε(r) ≪ n2

If the terms up to ﬁrst order in 1/n0 only are retained in ˆH, dropping the
terms proportional to the second and higher powers of 1/n0, one gets the
paraxial theory applicable to an ideal ﬁrst order, or linear, system without
any aberrations, or nonlinearities. To treat a nonlinear or aberrating system,
to a given order, one has to keep in ˆH the terms proportional to powers of
1/n0 up to the desired order of approximation. To treat a given system the
corresponding Hamiltonian is chosen, up to desired order of accuracy, and
the integration of the optical Schr¨odinger equation (1) leads to the required
transfer (or Green’s) function, for the evolution of ψ(r) across the system,
from the input transverse plane to the output transverse plane.

To arrive at the above formalism one usually starts with the scalar optical

wave equation

and specializes to the monochromatic case Ψ(r, t) = ψ(r) exp (−iωt). Then,
ψ(r) satisﬁes the Helmholtz equation

positive z-direction; if the propagation is in the negative z-direction, with

It should be noted that the passage from (5) to (7) reduces the original
boundary value problem to a ﬁrst order initial value problem in z. This
reduction is of great practical value since it leads to the powerful system or
the Fourier optic approach [7] However, the above reduction process itself can
never be claimed to be rigorous or exact. Hence there is room for alternative
procedures for the reduction. Of course, any such reduction scheme is bound
to lack in rigor to some extent, and the ultimate justiﬁcation lies only in the
results the scheme leads to. The purpose of this note is to explore one such
possibility based on the analogy between (4) and the Klein-Gordon equation
for a spin-0 particle. Before beginning this exploration, it is useful to recount
brieﬂy some of the other attempts to go beyond the paraxial regime.

3 Beyond the paraxial approximation

There have been several notable attempts to go beyond the paraxial approx-
imation and, in that process, to obtain a precise knowledge of the meaning
and accuracy of paraxial wave optics itself. We highlight here only some of
these, and the reader may consult these works for further references.

A signiﬁcant early attempt in this regard is due to Lax et al. [8]. These
authors pointed out that the process of neglecting grad div ~E and seeking a
solution that is plane polarized in the same sense everywhere is simply in-
compatible with the exact Maxwell equations. They developed an expansion
procedure in powers of the beam parameter (w0/ℓ), where w0 is the waist
size and ℓ = 2πw2
0/λ is the diﬀraction length or (twice the) Rayleigh range
of the beam under consideration. In addition to showing that the zero-order
ﬁeld obeyed the Maxwell system of equations, they developed the equations
obeyed by the higher-order corrections. The ﬁrst-order correction was shown
to be longitudinal.

Agarwal and Pattanayak [9] studied the propagation of Gaussian beam
in a simple [linear, homogeneous, and isotropic] dielectric using the angu-
lar spectrum representation for the electric ﬁeld, and showed that the ex-
act solution consisted of the paraxial result plus higher-order non-Gaussian
correction terms. They demonstrated, in particular, that the second-order
correction term satisﬁed an equation consistent with the work of Lax et al.
cited above. In another paper Agarwal and Lax [10] examined the role of
the boundary condition in respect of the corrections to the paraxial approx-
imation of Gaussian beams. This work resolved the controversy between the

4

work of Couture and Belanger [11] and that of Agarwal and Pattanayak [9],
by tracing it to the fact that the two works had used qualitatively diﬀerent
boundary conditions for the correction terms: while Agarwal and Pattanayak
had made the more natural demand that the ﬁeld distribution in the waist
plane be strictly Gaussian in the exact treatment, as in the paraxial case,
Couture and Belanger had demanded the on-axis ﬁeld to be the same in both
treatments.

A major step in directly connecting solutions of the paraxial equation
to those of the exact treatment was taken by W¨unsche [12], who showed
that it is possible to construct a linear transition operator which transforms
arbitrary solutions of the paraxial equation into exact (monochromatic) so-
lutions of the scalar wave equation (Helmholtz equation). Indeed, W¨unsche
constructed two such operators T1, T2 correspondng to two diﬀerent bound-
ary conditions and noted, moreover, that the transition operator method is
equivalent to the complete integration of the system of coupled diﬀerential
equations of Lax et al., restricted to the scalar case. Cao and Deng [13] de-
rived a simpler transform operator under the condition that the evanescent
waves can be ignored, and used this transform to study the corrections to the
paraxial approximation of arbitrary freely propagating beam. They veriﬁed
the consistency of their conclusions with those of the perturbation approach
of Lax et al. Subsequently, Cao [14] applied the method of Lax el al to
nonparaxial light beam propagating in a transversely nonuniform refractive
index medium, computed the correction terms in detail, and specialized the
results to the case of Gaussian beam propagating in transversely quadratic
refractive index media.

The transition operator method has been further extended by Alonso
et al.
[15]. The uncertainty product has played a fundamental role in the
analysis of paraxial (both coherent and partially coherent) beams. Alonso
and Forbes [16] have recently generalized the uncertainty product to the case
of nonparaxial ﬁelds.

There are two aspects to the issue of going beyond paraxial optics. The
ﬁrst one is to do with the spatial dependence alone, and hence applies to
‘scalar’ optics. The second one is to do with the vectorial nature of the light
ﬁeld and, more speciﬁcally, with the fact that Maxwell’s is a constrained
system of equations. The restriction div ~E = 0 (in free space and in homo-
geneous dielectrics) demands that the spatial dependence of the ﬁeld, even
in a transverse plane like the waist plane, cannot be chosen independent of
[Thus, an input plane-polarized plane wave going through a
polarization.

thin spherical lens results, in the exit plane of the lens, in a wave which is
spherical and hence necessarily has spatially-varying polarization so that the
Poynting vector at all points in the exit plane points to the focus of the lens.]
Though the work of Lax et al. pointed to both these aspects, the subsequent
ones noted above largely concentrated on the ﬁrst.

Examining the fundamental Poincar´e symmetry of the Maxwell system
in the front-form of Dirac, Mukunda et al. [17] developed a formalism which
converts a solution of the scalar wave equation into a corresponding (ap-
proximate) solution of the Maxwell system, resulting in a generalization of
Fourier optics for vector electromagnetic beams [18]. This formalism leads
to simple-looking electromagnetic Gaussian beams [19], and predicts a cross-
polarization term [20] which is consistent with experimental observations [21].
Further analysis of electromagnetic Gaussian beams has been presented by
Sheppard and Saghaﬁ [22], and by Chen et al. [23].

We describe below some preliminary results of an ongoing research on the
use of the FW transformations to study nonparaxial beams and the passage
through optical systems which are not necessarily paraxial (Gaussian). There
are two primary reasons for our believing that this approach may have ad-
vantage over the ones noted above. First, the FW technique iteratively takes
the ﬁeld to a new representation where the forward propagating components
get progressively decoupled from the backward propagating components. Sec-
ondly, the FW method appears ideally suited for the Lie algebraic approach
[5]. Finally, the FW technique generalizes to the vector case with very little
extra eﬀort, as will be shown in a subsequent report.

(cid:16)

In the traditional scheme the purpose of expanding the Hamiltonian ˆH =
−
in a series using 1/n0 as the expansion parameter is to
understand the propagation of the quasiparaxial beam in terms of a series
of approximations (paraxial + nonparaxial). Let us recall that in relativistic
quantum mechanics too one has a similar problem of understanding the rela-
tivistic wave equation as the nonrelativistic approximation plus the relativis-
tic correction terms in the quasirelativistic regime. For the Dirac equation
(which is ﬁrst order in time) this is done using the FW transformation lead-
ing to an iterative diagonalization technique. For the Klein-Gordon equation
(which is second order in time) this is done using the same FW technique

6

after linearizing it with respect to time, and thus bringing it to a Dirac-like
form, following the Feschbach-Villars method [6]. Nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger
equation and the Klein-Gordon equation applicable in the cases of ion and
electron optics, when the spin is disregarded, have also been treated in a
similar way using the FW technique [24, 25]. The analogy between the op-
tical wave equation (4) and the Klein-Gordon equation suggests naturally a
similar technique for treating the scalar wave theory of light beams. Though
the suggestion to employ the FW technique in the case of the Helmholtz
equation exists in the literature as a remark [26] it has not so far been ex-
ploited to analyze the quasiparaxial approximations for any speciﬁc beam
optical system.

The eﬀect of the transformation in (10) for a quasiparaxial beam moving
in the forward z-direction is to separate the component which is ‘fast’ in z
from the one which is ‘slow’ : there exists one linear combination of ψ and
∂ψ/∂z which varies rapidly in z and another which varies slowly in z, and
the above transformation picks precisely these components. In our case of

This form of the Helmholtz equation is analogous to the Feschbach-Villars
form of the Klein-Gordon equation. Note that equation (11) thus derived is
algebraically very similar to the Dirac equation. Like in the Dirac equation,
ˆH(1) is the sum of a leading diagonal term −n0σz (analogous to mc2β), a di-
agonal ‘even’ term ˆE (1) which does not couple the large and the small compo-
nents of Ψ(1), and the oﬀ-diagonal ‘odd’ term ˆO(1) which couples them. The
even term ˆE (1) commutes with σz and the odd term ˆO(1) anticommutes with
σz : ˆE (1)σz = σz ˆE (1) and ˆO(1)σz = −σz ˆO(1). This perfect analogy between the
Dirac equation and (11) enables us to use the standard FW transformation
technique to analyze (11) in terms of paraxial and higher order expansions
with 1/n0 as the expansion parameter. This technique works as follows.

In ˆH(1) the oﬀ-diagonal odd term is small compared to the diagonal part
−n0σz + ˆE (1) in which the leading term is of order n0. A series of successive
transformations of Ψ(1), following a ﬁxed recipe described below, is applied
to (11) such that after each transformation the oﬀ-diagonal odd term of the
resulting equation becomes weaker, being of higher order in 1/n0. If at any
stage the odd term is considered weak enough to be neglected then one can
approximate the corresponding iterated Hamiltonian by keeping only its di-
agonal part. Thus, this iterative diagonalization scheme can be carried out
systematically up to any desired order in the expansion parameter 1/n0. It
is interesting to note that (11) corresponds already to the paraxial approxi-
mation (8) of the Helmholtz equation if the odd term ˆO(1) is dropped from
ˆH(1), retaining only the diagonal part −n0σz + ˆE (1).

basic algebraic structure, ˆE (2)σz = σz ˆE (2) and ˆO(2)σz = −σz ˆO(2), is preserved
by the iteration.

(cid:16)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

This happens because the expressions in (16) follow as a result of the general
algebraic properties of the even and odd operators, independent of the spe-
ciﬁc expressions for ˆE (1) and ˆO(1) given in (12). Further, ˆE (3)σz = σz ˆE (3) and

ˆO(3)σz = −σz ˆO(3), and ˆO(3) is of order (1/n0)3. Thus the odd part of ˆH(3) is
weaker than the odd part of ˆH(2) by one more order. Now, it is straightfor-
ward to see how this sequence of FW transformations can be continued up
to any desired stage, making the odd part of the resulting ˆH(·) weaker by one
more order at each stage.

If the FW transform process is stopped at, say, the j-th stage then one

formation preserves and improves the property that the upper component
of Ψ(·) is large compared to its lower component : Ψ(j)
− . In view of
this, we can drop the odd part ˆO(j) from ˆH(j), as negligible compared to the

Comparing (25) with the traditional expansion in (3) it is clear that ˆH has
the ﬁrst few terms of the traditional Hamiltonian ˆH correctly, plus an extra
term (the commutator term). To get the higher order terms of ˆH in ˆH with
the correct coeﬃcients one will have to consider approximations beyond the
second order. We assume, for consistency, that the derivatives of ε(r) are
also small compared to n0.

One may note that the FW scheme automatically leads to a Hermitian
Hamiltonian without need for any further ordering of its noncommuting com-
ponents.

tributes a correction to the optical Hamiltonian, even at the ‘paraxial level’,
when the refractive index of the medium suﬀers both longitudinal and trans-

in (16). In the Foldy-Wouthuysen formalism of the Dirac theory the corre-
sponding commutator term is responsible for the correct explanation of the
spin-orbit energy (including the Thomas precession eﬀect) and the Darwin
term (attributed to the zitterbewegung) (see Sectioin 4.3 of [6]). Similarly
in the nonrelativistic reduction and interpretation of the Klein-Gordon equa-
tion using the Foldy-Wouthysen transformation theory such a commutator
term corresponds to the Darwin term correcting the classical electrostatic
interation of a point charge in analogy to the zitterbewegung of the Dirac

charged Klein-Gordon and Dirac particles [24, 25] the corresponding terms
add to the Hamiltonian the lowest order quantum corrections to the classical
aberration terms. In view of this analogy it should be of interest to study
the eﬀect of this correction term to the optical Hamiltonian,
,
on the propagation of Gaussian beams in a parabolic index medium whose
i
focusing strength is modulated in the axial variable z, however tiny it may
be compared to the classical terms.

Other questions naturally suggested by the above preliminary report are:
the issue of convergence in respect of the series expansion resulting from the
FW method and the boundary condition the series satisﬁes in relation to the
paraxial result in any special plane like the waist plane of the beam. The
precise relation between the FW series and the results of the other approaches
recounted in Section 3 are not immediately clear at the moment, but it is
an important issue worth investigating. We hope to return to these issues
elsewhere.

The authors would like to thank the Referees for some insightful com-

ments leading to improved clarity of presentation.

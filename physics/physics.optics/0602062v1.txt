Abstract

Theoretical and experimental evidence of light driven structuring of glasses is presented. We

show that light overcomes Coulomb repulsion and eﬀective electron-electron interaction in glasses

under strong light pumping becomes attractive. As the result homogenious distribution of trapped

electrons gets unstable and macroscopic electron bunches are grown. At diﬀerent conditions ordered

structures with period 2µm ± 0.2µm determined by internal properties of the material are formed

These structures were observed in ablation: surface proﬁle after laser treatment reveals ordered

pattern corresponding to the light induced electron domains.

INTRODUCTION

Direct and obvious method of light driven structuring is the using of a special light ﬁeld

conﬁguration. Generation of the light intensity grating and corresponding grating of exci-

tations are widely discussed. More interesting and physically rich is structuring due to light

driven self-organization. This ordering belongs to the class of self-organization phenomena

in open dissipative systems and it is presented here. The typical examples of this class are

Benard convection [1], Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions [2] and Turing instability [3]. All

self-organization phenomena are driven by some external ﬂow through the system: heat in

Benard convection, chemical reagents in Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions, etc. Optical ana-

logue of Turing instability was presented in [4]. In the latter case light amplitude has been

modulated in time and space, which was crucial for the organization to occur. Our investi-

gations(see [5], [6], [7] and references therein) have shown that steady light ﬂow through a

system can provide ordering either. This light is a driving force which bunches the electrons

in the case in hand. An electron in disordered media (we shall call them ”glasses”) moves

in random potential forming its energy spectrum. It consists of the extended electron and

hole bands separated by the ”gap” ﬁlled by the local states. We shall discuss here the case

when photon energy is less than the gap in glass and light generates transitions between

local states only. Transitions between diﬀerent traps are of a spacial interest. They are

responsible for the light induced current and the structuring of the matter discussed. The

electron transfer from an initial trap i to the ﬁnal trap f may be treated as generation of

electron and hole at sites f and i respectively. Strong Coulomb electron-hole interaction is

changed considerably with the shift of the distance between traps f and i therefore strong

electron-phonon coupling takes place. Light absorption in the case of strong electron-phonon

interaction is well studied. The rate wf i of the electron transition between sites i and f is

given by the formula [8]

(¯hω − ǫf i − A)2
∆2
where I is photon ﬂux, ¯hω is photon energy, ǫf i = ǫf − ǫi is the energy of the electron

wf i = Iσ0cos2θf iexp(−

− κf iRf i)

(ǫf i > 0),

excitation (diﬀerence between electron energies ǫf in trap f and ǫi in trap i ); Rﬁ = Rf −Ri;

Rf i = |Rﬁ|, where vectors Rf and Ri points positions of the traps; θf i is the angle between
Rf i and the light polarization vector, σ0 ≈ 10−18cm2, ∆ ≈ 10−1÷10−2eV , A ≈ 10−1÷10−2eV

is the Stokes shift. The light driven electron transitions in hand are accompanied by phonon

2

generation. Phonons are excluded from the formula (1) therefore exact energy conservation

law ¯hω = ǫf i + ¯hΩ (¯hΩ is phonon energy) looks like conservation with the accuracy ∆ ≈ ¯hΩ:

according to (1) an electron may be transfered to diﬀerent levels in the range of the band

width ∆. Absorption band (1) as a function of ǫf i gains maximum (resonance) at the energy

M = ¯hω − A. We shall call the excited states with the ǫf i < M as low energy excitations

(deep levels) and excited states with the ǫf i > M as high energy ones.

LIGHT DRIVEN BUNCHING OF ELECTRONS

As a ﬁrst step we shall examine light driven kinetics of a single electron in external electric

ﬁeld E . It is nontrivial: as we shall see electron is shifted by light predominantly in opposite

to the electric force F = eE direction. The idea of such behavior is following. If vector of

electron transfer is R = Rf − Ri then dipole moment generated is d = eR (e < 0 is electron

charge). Field contribution to the energy of the excitation is δǫf i = −(dE) = −e(RE) ≡

−(RF) . If the electron is transported in opposite to the electric force direction ((RF) < 0)

the energy of the electron excitation δǫf i becomes larger; low energy excitation becomes

closer to resonance M and therefore probability of its generation increases. This means

that electron transfer to the deep levels goes predominantly in opposite to the electric force

direction. Electron transitions to high levels go mainly in the direction of the force but these

levels have less life time in comparison with deep levels therefore contribution of the deep

levels prevails. In the case of two electrons according to the above idea light would push

each electron in the direction of the other electron. Let the second electron is embedded

at positions j then Coulomb interaction shifts all energy levels for the ﬁrst electron and,
hence, shifting the excitation energies by e2/Rf j − e2/Rij for the transition i −→ f of the

ﬁrst electron. Transitions which reduces electron-electron distance give positive contribution

to the Coulomb energy and shift deep excitations towards the resonance M. That is why

low energy transitions of an electron are directed preferably towards the other electron and

eﬀective electron-electron interaction becomes attractive under strong pumping. Due to

shorter life time high energy excitations play minor role in comparison with deep levels

and therefore contribution of low energy excitations dominates. At high pumping these

transitions dominate also over ordinary mobility which is quite low and independent on

laser power. Eﬀective attraction between electrons makes their homogeneous distribution

3

unstable and electron bunches are formed.

Phonon assistance designates two peculiar features of our system: ﬁrst, it is dissipative

(not Hamiltonian); secondly, phonons brake phase relations for the electron wave functions

therefore nondiagonal elements of the density matrix vanish and only probabilities of the

site populations appear in consideration and they give full and correct description of the

system. If the energy diﬀerence ǫf i < 0 (electron loses energy), there are two channels to

transit: ﬁrst, it can undergo light-induced transition with the rate being described in a way

analogous to (1) with the only change A to −A ([8]); second, it may relax to a lower energy

state with the rate γf i = γ0exp(−κf iRf i). So, for the electron transition process with the

energy loss we have:

wf i = Iσ0cos2θf jexp(−

(¯hω − ǫif + A)2
∆2

− κf iRf i) + γ0exp(−κf iRf i)

(ǫf i < 0)

(2)

The factor γ0 is of the order of the inverse lifetime for excited electron states in an atom,
so that γ0 ≈ 108s−1. Light driven kinetics is governed by dimensionless pumping constant
γ0 . Wave function of trapped electron outside the trap i is Ψi(R) ∝ e−κi|R−Ri|, where
µ = Iσ0

¯h2 (V − ǫi), m is the electron mass, V is spacing of bottom of trapped levels from the

Wave function of deep levels vanishes rapidly outside the trap while shallow levels have

bottom of the extended states. Normal scale for this parameter is κ0 =

where R = |Ri − Rj|) and n are the occupation numbers of the corresponding traps, t is

the system. This normalization avails to see the interaction eﬀect: if the electrons were not

interacting, one would have K(R) ≡ const for the noncorrelated case. The typical K(R) for

three dimensions is shown in Fig. 1.

The parameters used for calculation are: average trap distance a = 5 ˚A, κ0 = 1/a, ¯hω =

0.2eV , impurity band width V = 0.3eV , ∆ = 0.1eV , A = 0.1eV . The bound state of two
electrons is formed at pumping constant µ = Iσ0
γ0 > 1. Pumping constant µ = 1 corresponds
to laser power 107W/cm2. We found that at high pumping in wide region of parameters

the correlation function has such a maximum. Despite the Coulomb repulsion two electrons

prefer to stay at some ﬁnite distance. Analogous behavior has been observed for d = 2 and

5

d = 1. Increase of average distance a between the traps (decrease of Coulomb interaction)

results in narrowing and vanishing of the peak in K(R). At lower µ the peak in K(R)

vanishes also (see for the details [6]).

Electron motion reveals competition between ordinary mobility in the direction of the

electric force eE given by relaxation term ∝ γ0 in (2) and light driven electron transfer

in opposite direction. At long distance between the electrons the light induced transitions

dominate and an electron is pushed to the other electron: light overcomes Coulomb repulsion

(!). This motion is stopped at short distances where Coulomb repulsion dominates: electrons

do not penetrate to short distance where correlation function tends to zero (Fig. 1). Electric
ﬁeld at this distance is E = e/R2 = 107V /cm and this is an estimation for the eﬀective

electric ﬁeld caused by light induced electron transfer. This ﬁeld is close to the damage ﬁeld
3 ∗ 107V /cm. As the result of the competition bound state of two electrons is formed with

some preferable distance between particles. Eﬀective attraction between electrons results

in light driven electron bunching. We examined behavior of few electrons or even 10 ÷ 100

electrons and found quite similar peculiarities. Energy shift of the initial levels for hopping

electron is analogous to (4) but is given by all other electrons:

We studied temporal change of the average size of the electron cloud R2 =

motion which is impossible in thermodynamic case: the system tends to the state with

higher energy (Fig. 3). Bunch formation is accompanied by strong increase of the electric

ﬁeld at the boundary of the bunch. The formation is stopped by this ﬁeld when it gains the
value ≈ 107V /cm. It is convenient to introduce ground state and electron-hole presentation

for the investigation of many body system in glass. Glass never attain full thermodynamic

equilibrium but partial equilibrium is possible and one may consider that at ground state

all electron levels bellow some energy ǫF are occupied and states above this level are empty.

Energy shift of a level is determined in this case by the contribution of all electrons and

holes available.

many body system of diﬀerent size for one-, two- and three-dimensional samples. In main

features it is the same for all dimensions. The corresponding model is presented in details in

[5], [6], [7]. Computer simulation of the electron kinetics in the ﬁnite sample under external

electric ﬁeld shows that in agreement with the above idea electrons are transported by light

predominantly in the direction opposite to the electric force (electric current ﬂows contra

the voltage drop). This transfer is in contrast to the electron motion in a thermodynamic

case when electrons move in the direction of the external force reducing in accordance with

the Le Chatelet principle the external ﬁeld (negative feedback). In our case glass reveals

positive feedback in response to the electric ﬁeld. As a result strong static polarization di-

rected in opposite to the external electric ﬁeld is established. This polarization ampliﬁes the

initial ﬁeld considerably. At the ﬁeld of saturation light induced electron transitions are in

the dynamical equilibrium with the ordinary electron mobility in opposite direction. Com-

puter simulation of the light driven electron-hole kinetics have shown positive feedback in

response to static electric ﬁeld in wide region of parameters independently on the dimension

of the system. This unusual response makes homogeneous electron distribution unstable: an

electron moves towards another electron or towards a cluster of electrons and macroscopic

bunches are formed.

EXPERIMENTAL

We performed special experiment in order to observe directly the discussed bunching.

Strong laser wave with photon energy ¯hω ≈ 7eV was used. Band gap in our glass ǫg ≈ 8eV

and therefore direct generation of free electrons and holes is impossible. However in the

region of strong electric ﬁeld due to Franz-Keldysh eﬀect [9], [10] this process becomes

eﬀective. Energy discrepancy δǫ between the glass gap and photon energy is gained from

the static electric ﬁeld in process of electron tunneling (the corresponding estimation see in

[6]). So, domain boundaries due to strong electric ﬁeld become a weak chain in glass bonds

and light driven bond breaking (local fusion) reveals bunch structure of the self-organized

state. High quality UV-grade fused silica samples (KU-1) with thicknesses of 1 ÷ 10mm

have been used in the experiment. Before the experiment the samples have been subjected

to ultrasonic cleaning in acetone and ethanol followed by washing in de-ionized water. Two

beams from the unstable resonator of the ArF excimer laser (193nm, CL-7000, PIC GPI)

were focused on the rear side of a sample by the lens made of MgF2. We changed the

angle between beams and therefore produced grating with diﬀerent periods at the output

surface of the glass. ArF excimer laser generated 20ns FWHM pulses with energies up to

350mJ and pulse repetition rate up to 100Hz (µ >> 1). Ablation has been performed in

ambient air as well as in a hermetic chamber that was purged by nitrogen or evacuated.

Silica surface morphology and etched structures depth have been analyzed with an optical

microscope with further recording with Cohu-4812 CCD camera. Photograph of the surface

after the light treatment is presented in Fig. 5.

One can see farrows (grating) corresponding to the light intensity grating with the pe-

riod ≈ 10µm and self-organized structure of each of them with the period 2µm ± 0.2µm

corresponding to the discussed here self-organized electron bunches. This size has nothing

in common with the light ﬁeld scale (wavelength, beam size, coherent length etc.), it is

determined by internal properties of the glass what is characteristic feature of self-organized

system and coincides exactly with the period of the bubble structure found in single wave

experiment shown in Fig. 6 [6]. We changed coherent length of the light waves, beam sizes,

beam power and found that surface proﬁles (Figs. 5, 6) remain the same: all experiments

reveals the same spatial period 2µm ± 0.2µm what is typical for the self-organized systems.

The material sputtering (ablation) occurs on the rear side of a fused silica plate with no

stimulation of the process (such as plasma generation in the vicinity of a sample or speciﬁc

UV absorbing medium [11]). Analogous behavior was observed in [12] where surface struc-

turing took place at the SiO2 − Si interface and was explained in another way as interface

property.

CONCLUSIONS

Our theoretical and experimental study of light driven electron kinetics in silica glass have

shown that homogeneous distribution of the trapped electrons becomes unstable under light

pumping and macroscopic electron (hole) bunches are formed. In wide region of the external

parameters light pushes electrons into micron size coagulums which we observed in ablation

process. Under diﬀerent conditions structures with the same spatial period 2µm ± 0.2µm

are formed. This new length is determined by the internal properties of the material and

is idependent on light properties (beam size, beam power, coherent length etc.)

It was

found that UV beam λ = 193nm provides bunching and subsequent local bond breaking

eﬀectively but wave λ = 248nm can not drive this process. Deeper electrons with short tails

of electron wave functions are involved in this case (κf i is increased) and probabilities of the

transitions are less. In addition the energy discrepancy δǫ is increased therefore probability

of Franz-Keldysh tunneling becomes negligable. We observed also red luminescence of the

glass sample under UV pumping recently reported in number of papers (see [11] and cited

12

in [5] references). Ordering under light pumping discussed here may be the basement of the

so called ”compaction eﬀect” (see [13] and references therein) being the serious problem in

lithography. Ordered by light glass state certainly is more compact.

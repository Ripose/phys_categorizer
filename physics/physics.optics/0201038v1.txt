wells

An undoped double quantum well (DQW) was driven with a
terahertz (THz) electric ﬁeld of frequency ωT Hz polarized in the
growth direction, while simultaneously illuminated with a near-
infrared (NIR) laser at frequency ωNIR. The intensity of NIR upcon-
verted sidebands ωsideband = ωNIR + ωT Hz was maximized when
a dc voltage applied in the growth direction tuned the excitonic states
into resonance with both the THz and NIR ﬁelds. There was no de-
tectable upconversion far from resonance. The results demonstrate
the possibility of using gated DQW devices for all-optical wave-
length shifting between optical communication channels separated
by up to a few THz.

A basic function in a wavelength division multiplexed
(WDM) optical communications network is to switch data be-
tween different wavelength channels. All-optical switching
in a WDM network requires the ability to shift the frequency
of a near-infrared (NIR) carrier of a NIR carrier by several
terahertz (THz) [1]. This has been accomplished by four-
wave mixing of NIR beams in semiconductor optical ampli-
ﬁers [2], and three-wave mixing in quasi-phase-matched Al-
GaAs waveguides [3].

Generation of THz optical sidebands on a NIR carrier beam
has recently been studied in various semiconductor systems
[4–6]. Great ﬂexibility for practical optoelectronic devices
that operate at THz frequencies lie with gated double quantum
well (DQW) structures, in which two quantum wells (QW) are
separated by a thin tunnel barrier. Their intersubband spac-
ings can be engineered to lie in the THz frequency range by
adjusting the width of the tunnel barrier. Meanwhile, the opti-
cal bandgap can be separately tuned by the width of the indi-
vidual wells. Large optical nonlinearities can be built into the
DQW [7] by using an asymmetric DQW in which carriers feel
a non-centrosymmetric conﬁnement potential. Finally, the in-
tersubband spacing can be tuned by applying a DC voltage to
the gates.

This paper describes experiments in which a near-infrared
(NIR) probe laser beam is modulated at THz frequencies in a
gated, asymmetric DQW. The THz ﬁeld couples to an exci-
tonic intersubband excitation while the NIR ﬁeld couples to
an excitonic interband excitation. Applying a DC voltage to
the gates can bring the intersubband transition into resonance

with the THz ﬁeld, and the interband transition into resonance
with the NIR ﬁeld. When these resonance conditions are met
the NIR probe is modulated resulting in the emission of opti-
cal sidebands which appear at frequencies

ωsideband = ωN IR + nωT Hz

(1)

where ωN IR (ωT Hz) is the frequency of the NIR (THz) beam
and n = ±1, 2, . . ..

The sample consisted of an active region containing the
DQWs, a distributed Bragg reﬂector (DBR), and two gates,
each consisting of a narrow n-doped quantum-well. The band
diagram of the sample is shown in Fig. 1.

The active region consisted 5 periods of DQW, each con-
sisting of a 120 ˚A GaAs QW and a 100 ˚A GaAs QW sepa-
rated by a 25 ˚A Al0.2Ga0.8As tunnel barrier. Each period is
separated by a 300 ˚A Al0.3Ga0.7As barrier. The active region
is thin compared to a NIR wavelength. A thicker active region
generates stronger sidebands, but is more difﬁcult to model
due to reabsorption, phase-matching, and screening effects.

The dimensions of the DQW were designed so that the
two lowest-lying electron subbands were separated by ≈ 10
meV (≈ 2.4 THz) at ﬂat-band. This is around the center of
the range of high-quality operating frequencies of our THz
source, the UCSB Free Electron Laser (FEL). Within the 10
meV energy splitting constraint, the degree of asymmetry was
designed to peak the strength of the sideband near ﬂat-band
conditions.

The DBR consisted of 15 periods of 689 ˚A AlAs and 606 ˚A
Al0.3Ga0.7As. It had a low-temperature passband nearly cen-
tered on the low-temperature bandgap of the DQW, making it
about 95% reﬂective for the NIR probe beam and sidebands.
The active region was sandwiched between the two gates,
each consisting of a Si delta-doped 70 ˚A QW with carrier den-
sity ≈ 1 × 1012 cm−2. The gates are separated from the ac-
tive region by 3000 ˚A Al0.3Ga0.7As barriers. Since the gate
QWs are much narrower than the active DQWs, the gate QWs
are transparent to both the THz and NIR beams. A mesa was
etched and NiGeAu ohmic contacts annealed to the gate QWs.
The experimental setup is illustrated in Fig. 2. The sam-
ple was cooled to 21 K in a closed-cycle He crystat. The
THz beam from the FEL is polarized in the growth direction,
propagated in the QW plane and focused by a 90o off-axis
parabolic mirror (F/1) onto the cleaved edge of the sample.

which overlap the ≈ 5 µs FEL pulses. The vertically-
polarized NIR beam propagates normal to the THz beam,
and was focused (F/10) at a power density of ≈ 50 W/cm2
to the same small interaction volume in the sample. The
reﬂected beam, sidebands, and photoluminescence (PL) are
analyzed by a second polarizer, dispersed by a 0.85 m Ra-
man double-monochromator, and detected by a photomulti-
plier tube (PMT).

A typical n > 0 sideband spectrum is shown in Fig. 3. The
conversion efﬁciency scale was calibrated by attenuating the
NIR laser to match the peak sideband signal, and factoring the
loss through the collection and dispersion optics. We present
results for the n = +1 sidebands as a continuous function of
gate bias (Vg) and NIR laser frequency (ωN IR) at various THz
laser frequencies (ωT Hz).

A sideband voltage scan with ωN IR = 1546 meV and
ωT Hz = 2.5 THz is shown in Fig. 4.
In this scan, Vg is
scanned while all other parameters are kept constant so that
ωdetect = ωN IR + ωT Hz. Note that at dc electric ﬁelds far
from resonance there are no detectable sidebands. This type
of scan demonstrates the voltage tunability of the THz-NIR
modulation.

The distinct peaks are labelled with excitonic transition
assignments derived from a nonlinear susceptibility calcu-
lation for THz-NIR mixing due to excitons [8,9]. The la-
bel EµHHνX refers to the exciton consisting of an electron
in subband µ and a heavy hole in subband ν. A double-
resonance condition holds when the NIR ﬁeld is resonant with
an exciton and the THz ﬁeld resonantly couples two excitons.
To understand the full resonant structure of the sideband
generation process at each THz frequency, the sideband was
measured as a continuous function of both ωN IR and Vg. By
taking a sideband voltage scan at each ωN IR we measured the
sideband maps shown in Figs. 5 and 6 at ωT Hz =2.0 THz
and 2.5 THz (8.2 meV and 10.4 meV). Again, peaks in the
sideband emission occur when the NIR ﬁeld is resonant with
an exciton and the THz ﬁeld resonantly couples two excitons;
they are labelled with excitonic transition assignments.

In summary, we have modulated a NIR laser beam at THz
frequencies by driving the excitonic intersubband transition of
an asymmetric DQW. A pair of n-doped QW gates which are
transparent to both the NIR and THz ﬁelds allow the resonant
response of the device to be tuned by applying a dc voltage, al-
lowing the device to act as a voltage-controllable wavelength
converter. The peak conversion response occurs when the NIR
ﬁeld is resonant with an exciton and the THz ﬁeld resonantly
couples two excitons.

An erbium doped micro-laser is demonstrated utilizing SiO2 microdisk resonators on a silicon

chip. Passive microdisk resonators exhibit whispering gallery type (WGM) modes with intrinsic

optical quality factors of up to 6 × 107 and were doped with trivalent erbium ions (peak concentra-
tion ∼ 3.8 × 1020cm−3) using MeV ion implantation. Coupling to the fundamental WGM of the

microdisk resonator was achieved by using a tapered optical ﬁber. Upon pumping of the 4I15/2

−→

4I13/2 erbium transition at 1450 nm, a gradual transition from spontaneous to stimulated emission

was observed in the 1550 nm band. Analysis of the pump-output power relation yielded a pump
threshold of 43 µW and allowed measuring the spontaneous emission coupling factor: β ≈ 1×10−3.

The increasing demand in computing power and communication bandwidth has gener-

ated an increased interest in the ﬁeld of silicon photonics which aims at creating photonic

elements utilizing standard, complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) processing

technology and materials, such as silica and silicon. As silica and silicon intrinsically lack
direct optical transitions, alternative methods such as erbium doping or creating Si − SiO2

nanostructures [10, 19] have been used to achieve optical emission. Despite these advances,

achieving lasing in CMOS compatible structures has remained challenging and has only been

observed recently via the Raman nonlinearity [5, 13] and by Er doping of silicon chip-based

silica toroid micro-cavities [12].

In this context, erbium is a particularly promising optical dopant as it provides gain in the

1.55 µm telecommunication range, and can be incorporated into a SiO2 by ion implantation

[11], which is an inherently CMOS compatible process. However, due to the small emission
cross section of Er at 1.55 µm (σ = 4 × 10−21cm2) in conjunction with the fact that Er
concentrations are limited to NEr ∼ 1 × 1022 ions /cm3 due to clustering, the modal gain is
limited to approximately ∼7 dB/cm. Lasing action under these Er gain conditions requires
≈ 105 (assuming mode overlap Λ =
optical resonators with quality factors Q > 2π

λ n
0.3 and refractive index n=1.44). These quality factors are readily available in toroidal

1
ΛσεNEr

micro-cavities [1] or silica microspheres [2], which use a laser assisted reﬂow process to

create ultra-high Q cavities. Indeed, using these microcavity geometries rare-earth doped

microcavity lasers were ﬁrst demonstrated [12, 14, 17]. However, the use of a CO2 laser

reﬂow makes control through ion implantation diﬃcult, since restructuring of the silica

takes place. Increased control of the Er distribution relative to the optical mode is essential

to achieve low lasing threshold or high gain. In addition, increased control is important in

more complex materials systems such as e.g. Er-doped silica co-doped with Si nanocrystals

that act as sensitizers for Er [3].

A more amenable geometry to these studies are planar microdisks [4, 7], which can be

fabricated with small transverse dimensions on a Si chip. Fabrication of these disks does not

rely on a laser reﬂow process and doping with rare earth ions or Si ions by ion implantation

can be readily performed. Earlier work has already demonstrated that Q > 106 (at 1550

nm) can be achieved in silica microdisks [4], which indicates the possibility to observe Er

lasing in SiO2 microdisks.

In this Letter we demonstrate lasing in an Er-doped microdisk on a silicon chip. These

2

micro-lasers combine modal engineering of microdisk resonators with the nanoscale precise

control of the Er ion distribution in the disk through ion implantation, yielding optimum

overlap of the Er ions with the fundamental whispering gallery modes (WGM). By optical

pumping of the Er ions at 1.48 µm via a tapered optical ﬁber [15], lasing at 1.55 µm was

observed to occur at a threshold power of less than 43 µW. These results demonstrate Er

lasing from a microdisk resonator for the ﬁrst time, using CMOS compatible fabrication.

Fabrication of Er-doped microdisk lasers proceeded in several steps. The substrate used

in the present experiments was a Si(100) wafer covered with 1 µm thick thermally-grown

SiO2 ﬁlm. This oxide thickness represents a compromise between optical cavity design and

ion distribution. The Er ions were incorporated in the SiO2 by 2 MeV ion implantation

at room temperature. The corresponding implantation range of 560 nm was chosen to

obtain a good modal overlap with the fundamental whispering gallery modes (WGM)(cf.
Fig. 1). A total Er ﬂuence of 4.2 × 1015 ions/cm2 ions was implanted, yielding a Gaussian
depth distribution with a standard deviation σ ≈ 72nm. The average Er density within
the implanted layer is NEr = 3.8 × 1020 ions/cm3. (integrated over the full-width at half
maximum of the distribution), which corresponds to a modal gain of 2.66 cm−1 for σe =
7 × 10−21cm2. Upon implantation the oxidized wafer was annealed in Ar for 1 hour at 800

C, which yielded optimized photoluminescence intensity and lifetime. The lifetime found
(∼14 ms) demonstrated successful passivation of implantation induced defects. In addition,

a reference sample was fabricated in which the Er implantation at an energy of 4 MeV led to

an implantation depth exceeding the oxide thickness of 1000 nm. While this implantation

depth precludes the observation of lasing, it served as a reference to assess any deterioration

of the Q factor due to ion implantation.

Following Er ion implantation, microcavity fabrication was carried out by ﬁrst deﬁning

circular silica microdisks using optical lithography and hydroﬂuoric etching as detailed in

Refs.[1, 4]. The resulting microdisk had a diameter of 60 µm as shown in the scanning

electron micrograph (SEM) in Fig. 1. A key feature of the SiO2 disk, as seen in Fig. 1,

is the strong inclination of the cavity sidewalls that is inherent to the fabrication process,

which employs an isotropic HF etch. The disks were then undercut using a XeF2 gas

to isotroptically etch the silicon and thereby create an air-clad whispering gallery mode

structure. To optically test the microcavities, tapered optical ﬁbers were used which provide

high coupling ideality [15].

3

First, the reference microdisk resonators were tested in which no lasing of Er is expected.

In these experiments the cavity modes typically appeared as doublets in the transmission

spectrum, which is well known to result from scattering-induced coupling of the clockwise

and counterclockwise cavity modes [6, 16]. An example of such a transmission spectrum

is plotted as an inset in Fig. 2. Upon ﬁtting the data the inferred Q-factor for each of
the two modes was 5 × 107. This is a very high value for a planar microdisk, but still one

order of magnitude lower than in the case of toroid microcavities [1]. Importantly, these

Q-factors should readily allow for observation of lasing of the Er ions. The observed high Q

is attributed to the wedged-shaped edge of the disk microcavity, which is believed to isolate

modes from the disk perimeter and thereby reduce scattering losses [4]. This conjecture is

further corroborated using numerical ﬁnite-element simulations as shown in Fig. 1, which

demonstrate that an increased sidewall angle leads to an optical mode that is progressively

more removed from the outer, lower cavity boundary (which can induce scattering losses).
The Q value of 5 × 107 also provides a lower bound on the eﬀect of ion implantation induced

defects.

Next, the 2 MeV Er-implanted microdisks, with an active Er distribution peaking at

a depth of 560 nm were analyzed. First, the Q-factors in the range from 1410-1480 nm

were measured for a microdisk with a diameter of 60 µm (and an equivalent free-spectral-

range, FSR=9.1 nm) as shown in Fig. 2. To avoid variations in the overlap factor and

population-dependent Q, care was taken to measure the Q at the same launched power

for the same mode family (fundamental microdisk WGM). Upon approach of the Er3+

absorption band an increase in loss is evidenced. Speciﬁcally, while at 1428 nm the quality
factor was observed to be 1.5 × 106 it gradually reduced to a value as low as 2 × 105 at

1470 nm. Both the absolute value of the Q factor as well as its spectral dependence as

shown in Fig. 2 are in good agreement with the theoretically predicted Er3+ absorption-

limited Q (solid red curve in Fig. 2) assuming Λ=0.3, a typical value for the fundamental

WGM modes of the microdisk (cf. Fig. 1). Calculations for Λ=0.2 and Λ=0.5 are shown

for comparison (dotted lines). The inset of Fig. 2 shows the Q-dependence of the modal

coupling parameter [6] (Γ = τ /γ) deﬁned as the ratio of is the splitting frequency of the
degeneracy-lifted cavity modes (γ−1/2π), and the intrinsic cavity linewidth (τ −1/2π), both

derived from the transmission spectra as in the inset of Fig. 2. Data are taken for several

fundamental WGM. The linear dependence that is observed demonstrates that the quality

4

factors are dominated by absorption losses, in this case by Er3+ (i.e. since the scattering

rate is observed to be nearly constant for all pump modes the variation of Γ must be caused

by a change in absorption).

The excited erbium ions within the microcavity readily couple to the cavity modes. Due
to the Stark broadening of 4I15/2 −→ 4I13/2 transitions of Er3+ in SiO2, the ions are coupled

to many modes of the cavity. Indeed, as shown in Fig 3, upon pumping at 1450 nm the

spectrum collected through the coupled ﬁber taper contains several peaks throughout the

erbium emission band (separated by the FSR of 9.1 nm) clearly demonstrating that the

erbium ions are coupled to the (fundamental) cavity modes. Weaker, subsidiary peaks

observed in Fig. 3 are attributed to Er ions coupling to fundamental WGM’s of opposite

polarization. Note that relative strength of the observed Er3+ peak emission collected in the

tapered ﬁber depends both on the Er3+ emission spectrum, and the wavelength-dependent

ratio of internal to external quality factor, and therefore does not correspond exactly to

the Er3+ emission cross section spectrum. Upon increasing the launched pump power, the

erbium related luminescence in all modes increases linearly (data not shown), demonstrating

that the emission observed in Fig. 3(a) is due to spontaneous emission.

Upon further increase in launched pump power super-linear behavior in the spontaneous

emission is observed, as plotted in Fig. 4, followed by a linear pump-output relationship of

one of the modes at high power (cf. Fig. 3(b)), which we attribute to lasing. This change is

accompanied by an increase in diﬀerential slope eﬃciency for the lasing mode. The remaining

(non-lasing) modes did not show this transition. This behavior is well known in microcavity

lasers, which due to a large spontaneous emission coupling factor exhibit a gradual transition

from spontaneous emission to stimulated emission [18]. From linear interpolation the lasing

threshold was estimated to be 43 µW. This threshold value is consistent with the predicted
, NT = 3.8 × 1020cm−3, λp = 1480 nm, λs = 1555
value[9] using Vm = 2πRAm ≈ 600
nm, Λ = 0.3 and assuming that the intrinsic Q-factor of the lasing mode is Qs = 6×105. The

emission was observed to be single-mode for pump powers up to 400 µW, and the highest

output power observed was 10 µW. As we have demonstrated for toroidal cavities [9] higher

output powers can be achieved for overcoupled conditions, but at the expense of a higher

pump threshold.

To determine the spontaneous emission coupling factor (β), deﬁned as the fraction of

spontaneous emission coupled into the lasing mode with respect to the spontaneous emission

5

into all modes, the input-output power relationship was modeled using a rate equation model

[18], which yields

Here s is the cavity photon number, p the pump rate (of Er ions) Ω and the cavity loss

rate. The solid line in Fig. 4 is a three parameter ﬁt using in Eqn. (1), ﬁtting s to the

measured output power, β, and Ω . The pump coupling eﬃciency from ﬁber into the cav-

ity is assumed unity. The ﬁt exhibits satisfactory agreement with the data.

It is noted

however, that this model can deviate from the observed dependency pump-output relations

close to the threshold, for several reasons. First, the evanescent waveguide coupling ren-

ders the coupled power sensitive to the intrinsic cavity Q, which due to the presence of

Er is varying. Such a pump power-dependent Q (due to a pump-induced reduction of Er

absorption or nonlinear eﬀects), has already been observed in Raman micro-cavity lasers
[5, 8] . Speciﬁcally the coupled power (∆P ) is given by: ∆P = (1 − ( Qi−Qex

it is clear the pumping dependent Q will lead to loading eﬀects. As the observed Q factors

in the Er absorption band are limited by Er absorption for low pump powers, this eﬀect will

thus lead to an increased intrinsic Q. Eﬀects of varying Q are most prominent around the

threshold, since clamping of the population occurs above threshold, leading to constant Q

as is the case for low pump powers. Thus the low and high power laser dynamics are well

captured by the above model. A second eﬀect that is not taken into account by the above

model is a pump power-dependent Er excited state lifetime, due to up cooperative upcon-

version between excited Er ions [11]. To obtain an improved ﬁt in the region of low pump

and high pump power which determines the value of β (and in which the aforementioned

6

eﬀects are negligible), the pump-output relationship was ﬁtted on a double logarithmic scale

as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. From the model we derive the spontaneous emission cou-

pling factor, which describes the fraction of spontaneous emission coupled into cavity modes:
β = 1 × 10−3.

We ascribe this relatively low value of β, to a number of eﬀects. First of all, Er3+ ions

in glass exhibit large homogeneous broadening. As a consequence the erbium population

can decay via a large number of cavity modes. From the spontaneous emission spectrum in

Fig. 2(a), we can estimate that the total number of cavity modes (N) to which the Er ions
couple is ∼20 ( ∼10 modes at each TE and TM polarization ). Consequently, even in the

case of spontaneous emission taking place only in cavity modes the β which can be expected

is < 5% (=1/N). The yet lower experimentally observed value is ascribed to that fact that

spontaneous emission also occurs into free-space modes (non-cavity modes).

In summary, we have realized an erbium-implanted microlaser using a silica microdisk on

a silicon wafer. A pump threshold as low as 43 µW is observed, and the spontaneous emission
coupling factor is determined to be ∼ 1 × 10−3 for the lasing mode, in fair agreement with

theory. The disk geometry presents several advantages over previous toroidal geometries

as it enables the direct use of ion implantation, a planar technology, for doping optical

microcavities. The CMOS compatibility of all fabrication step, including ion implantation,

may enable the use of these microdisk lasers in photonic and opto-electronic components

on a Si chip. Furthermore, these cavities are ideal microlaboratories to study fundamental

eﬀects of a broad range of ion beam doped optical materials.

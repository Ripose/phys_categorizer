Spectral phase conjugation, parametric ampliﬁcation, and mirrorless oscillation via extended phase
matching

Mankei Tsang∗

(Dated: February 21, 2014)

It is shown that the copropagating three-wave-mixing parametric process, with appropriate extended phase
matching, can perform spectral phase conjugation, parametric ampliﬁcation, and mirrorless oscillation, when
pumped with a short second-harmonic pulse. The ﬁnite pump pulse acts as an effective cavity with paramet-
ric gain to the signal and idler pulses, which, while copropagating in the laboratory frame, travel in opposite
directions in the frame of the moving pump pulse.

In contrast with the more conventional phase conjugation
schemes that perform phase conjugation with spectral inver-
sion in the frequency domain [1], spectral phase conjugation
(SPC) is the phase conjugation of an optical signal without
spectral inversion. Equivalently, in the time domain, SPC is
the phase conjugation and time reversal of the signal pulse en-
velope [2]. SPC is useful for all-order dispersion and nonlin-
earity compensation [3, 4] and signal processing applications
[5]. Although SPC has been experimentally demonstrated
using photon echo [6], spectral hole burning [7], temporal
holography [3], spectral holography [8], and spectral three-
wave mixing (TWM) [9], all the demonstrated schemes suffer
from the use of cryogenic setups, extremely high pump power,
or non-realtime operation. Pulsed transverse-pumping para-
metric processes have been theoretically proposed to perform
SPC [2, 10, 11], but have not yet been experimentally demon-
strated, presumably because of the short effective interaction
length.

There is a correspondence between classical SPC and
coincident frequency quantum entanglement, as shown in
Ref. [12] for the TWM [11, 13] or four-wave-mixing (FWM)
[2, 10] parametric process in the transverse-pumping ge-
ometry.
It is then interesting to see if other coincident
frequency entanglement schemes are capable of performing
SPC, when an input signal is present. This Letter studies
one of such schemes, which makes use of extended phase
matching [14] and has been experimentally demonstrated [15]
in a periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate (PPKTP)
crystal [16]. It is shown in this Letter that this scheme is in-
deed capable of performing SPC and optical parametric am-
pliﬁcation (OPA). The analysis also yields a surprising result,
namely that the extended-phase-matching scheme can also
perform mirrorless optical parametric oscillation (OPO) [17],
which had only been considered possible in counterpropagat-
ing conﬁgurations before. The main idea is that even though
the pump, signal and idler pulses copropagate in the labora-
tory frame, the signal and the idler counterpropagate in the
frame of the moving pump pulse, due to the restrictions on
their group velocities. Hence the moving pump pulse provides
both an effective cavity and parametric gain, leading to mir-
rorless oscillation. Furthermore, the classical analysis is use-
ful for quantum optics purposes, as it can easily be converted

to a quantum analysis in the Heisenberg picture. The anal-
ysis presented in this Letter enables many quantum informa-
tion processing applications, for example, quantum-enhanced
synchronization [18] and quantum cryptography [19], to take
advantange of the high efﬁciency of the proposed scheme.

The main novelties of this Letter can thus be summarized as
follows. First, for the ﬁrst time to the author’s knowledge, the
proposed device is shown to be capable of performing SPC,
more efﬁciently than previous proposals [10, 11]. Second,
also for the ﬁrst time to the author’s knowledge, a copropa-
gating TWM process with an ultrashort pump pulse is shown
to be capable of mirrorless oscillation. All previous proposals
assume a continuous-wave (CW) pump, with counterpropa-
gating signal and idler (see, for example, Refs. [17] and [20]).
Copropagation of the pump, signal and idler leads to a longer
effective interaction length, and an ultrashort pump pulse
gives rise to a higher electric ﬁeld amplitude, all of which
contribute to a higher parametric gain compared to other mir-
rorless OPO schemes. Third, a high spontaneous parametric
down conversion efﬁciency for coincident frequency entan-
glement is predicted, which should be useful for many quan-
tum information processing applications. It must be stressed
that the proposed device is not merely a theoretical curiosity,
as it has already been experimentally realized for the purposes
of second-harmonic generation and coincident frequency en-
tanglement [15, 16]. Its adaptation to the proposed applica-
tions should subsequently be straightforward.

The signal and idler pulses, in orthogonal polarizations, have a carrier
frequency of ω0, while the pump pulse has a carrier frequency of
2ω0. The pump pulse should be much shorter than the signal.

Consider the copropagating TWM process (Fig. 1), assum-
ing that the basic type-II phase matching condition (ks + ki =

2kp) is satisﬁed, via quasi-phase matching for example, and
the pump pulse is undepleted and unchirped. The coupled-

One requires that the input signal pulse to be placed in ad-
vance of the pump (by ts >> Ts), and the input idler pulse
to be placed behind the pump (delayed by ti >> Ti), so that
the signal and the idler only overlap the pump pulse inside the

Equations (20) and (21) are the chief results of this Letter,
from which several conclusions can be drawn. Firstly, sup-
pose that the input idler Ai0 is zero, and the extended type-II

then γ = 1, and the output idler becomes the phase-
conjugated and time-reversed replica of the input signal. SPC
is hence performed. The SPC efﬁciency η, deﬁned as the out-
put idler ﬂuence divided by the input signal ﬂuence, is

(23)

The SPC efﬁciency of the proposed scheme is fundamentally
higher than that of the transverse-pumping device [11] due to
two reasons. One is the copropagation of the pump, signal
and idler, which makes G higher than a similar parameter in
s)−1, which is
the latter case by at least a factor of (1
typically on the order of 20. The second reason is that for η >
1, due to the tangent function dependence, the SPC efﬁciency
of the former increases with respect to G much faster than
that of the latter, which only depends on a similar parameter
exponentially.

Equations (3) and (4) are solved numerically via a Born
series approach to conﬁrm the above theoretical predictions.
Fig. 2 plots the intensities and phases of the input signal, out-
put signal, and output idler from the numerical analysis when
G = π/4. The plots clearly show that the output idler is
the time-reversed and phase-conjugated replica of the signal.
The signal and idler gains are calculated to be 1.98 and 0.98
respectively, which are very close to the theoretical values,
sec2(G) = 2 and tan2(G) = 1. Fig. 3 compares the SPC ef-
ﬁciency η obtained from the numerical analysis to theory for
different G’s. The numerical results are all within 4% of the
theoretical values.
Secondly, when

the output pulses become inﬁnite for a ﬁnite input, or in other
words, the outputs are non-zero for zero inputs, meaning that
parametric oscillation can occur without feedback [17]. Con-
sequently, the self-oscillation solutions are given by

G = π/2 fails to converge to a ﬁnite gain, suggesting that the
proposed theory still hold in the vicinity of the self-oscillation
condition. The inﬁnite gain implies that the undepleted pump
approximation no longer holds near G = π/2.

Lastly, given the input-output signal-idler relationship in
Eqs. (20) and (21), it is straightforward to obtain a quantum
picture of the parametric process by replacing the signal and
idler envelopes with Heisenberg operators. The average num-
ber of spontaneously generated photon pairs for coincident

frequency entanglemeent is therefore tan2(G). Moreover, the
unitary transform given by Eqs. (20) and (21) has the same
form as the CW four-wave-mixing process [21]. One then ex-
pects the photon state to be similarly given by [22]

sions with Prof. Demetri Psaltis and funding from DARPA.
The author would also like to thank a reviewer for pointing
out the references in [17].

where
is,i is the Fock state in the signal or idler mode. The
proposed scheme thus has a signiﬁcant advantage in efﬁciency
and robustness for multiphoton entanglement, compared to
other schemes that often require feedback [23]. The efﬁ-
cient multiphoton coincident frequency entanglement should
be useful for quantum-enhanced synchronization [18] and
quantum cryptography applications [19].

×

In practice, Kuzucu et al. obtained around 4

106 sponta-
neously generated photon pairs per second in their experiment
of coincident frequency entanglement, with a pump repetition
rate of 80 MHz [15], which corresponds to a G of roughly 0.2.
It is therefore not unrealistic to expect that unit SPC efﬁciency
(G = π/4) or self-oscillation (G = π/2) can be achieved, for
instance, by increasing the pump ﬁeld amplitude or further
optimizing the experimental setup.

Recent experimental progress on entangled photon sources
using third-order nonlinear processes [24] suggests that FWM
may be more favorable than TWM for quantum information
processing in certain cases, by offering advantages such as
compatibility with ﬁber optics. In view of this perspective,
the extended phase matching idea may also be used in a de-
generate vector FWM scheme [25] to perform SPC, OPA, mir-
rorless OPO, as well as coincident frequency entanglement.
Suppose that the signal and the idler are two orthogonally-
polarized modes with a carrier frequency of ω0. The two
pumps should also be in different polarizations, with carrier
δω and ωq = ω0 + δω respecitvely.

To perform the parametric processes above, one requires that
the group delays of the two pumps are the same (k′

the signal and idler group delays are different (k′

this idea further, which remains a future work.

In conclusion, it is proven that the copropagating TWM
process, with appropriate extended phase matching and
pumped with a short second-harmonic pulse, is capable of
performing SPC, OPA, and mirrorless OPO . Since the pro-
posed device has already been realized [15, 16], its adaptation
to classical purposes is expected to be straightforward. Ap-
plications in optical communications, signal processing and
quantum information processing can be envisaged.

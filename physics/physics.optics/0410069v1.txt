Abstract

Application of Karhunen-Loeve decomposition (KLD, or singular value decomposi-
tion) is presented for analysis of the spatio-temporal dynamics of wide-aperture vertical
cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL), considered as a thin-layer system. KLD tech-
nique enables to extract a set of dominant components from complex dynamics of
system under study and separate them from noise and inessential underlying dynam-
ical behavior. Properties of KLD spectrum and structure of its main components are
studied for diﬀerent regimes of VCSEL. Along with the analysis of VCSEL, a brief
survey of KLD method and its usage for theoretical and experimental description of
nonlinear dynamical systems is presented.

1 Introduction

Investigation of interaction of thin-ﬁlm systems with laser radiation becomes quite topical
during the last decade. This is mainly stimulated by advances of semiconductor technology,
which enable to obtain multi-layer semiconductor structures with thickness close to or even
less than wavelength of visible radiation. In particular, wide-aperture vertical cavity surface
emitting lasers (VCSELs) are wide-spread optical systems of communication and information
processing. Complex spatio-temporal regimes of VSCEL operation, in principle, opens new
possibilities for information processing (for example, “chaotic” encoding for secure applica-
tions). On the other hand, it is far from full understanding, what mechanisms form spatial
and temporal structure of radiation in VCSELs.

In the paper, we investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of VCSEL using the system of
diﬀerential equations describing the dynamics of broad area VCSEL [1]. The equations are
derived using spin ﬂip model [2, 3] and take into account polarization of light and complex
cavity of VCSEL, including Bragg reﬂectors. The propagation of radiation through the
VCSEL cavity is calculated in an approximation of thin nonlinear layer, which allows to
dismiss the diﬀraction of light in the active medium. Calculations of the current intensity
J near threshold and for some values far from threshold are performed for the case of zero
phase anisotropy, low amplitude anisotropy and homogeneous spatial proﬁles of refraction
index and injection current.

Obtained sets of spatiotemporal data are analyzed using Karhunen-Lo´eve decomposition
(KLD, also known by several other names [4]). Such technique is introduced in the beginning
of 20th century for description of random functions. Then this method have found numerous
applications in such areas as pattern recognition, turbulence, meteorology, coherence theory
etc. Optimal properties of KLD enables to extract only a few main components from the
whole complex dynamics of system under study.
The rest of article is organized as follows:

in the next section we outline the method
of or Karhunen-Lo´eve decomposition and its main characteristics. In the third section we
provide the mathematical model of VCSEL is presented. In the following section we analyze
of complex dynamics of VCSEL by KLD method. In particular, change of the decomposition
spectrum for the values of the current density J near lasing threshold and for some values
above threshold is discussed. The last section contains a conclusion and outline of future
tasks.

2 Karhunen-Lo´eve decomposition

In its simplest form, suitable for our purposes, the KLD method is formulated as follows:
given some (in general, complex) ﬁeld of two variables u(r, t) with r = (x, y), one tries to
ﬁnd its decomposition onto purely temporal and spatial modes:

u(r, t) =

λi ai(t) φi(r).

∞

Xi=1

(1)

(2)

with two orthonormality conditions

dr φi(r) φ∗

j (r) = δij

dt ai(t) a∗

j (t) = δij

ZS

ZT

where T is a time interval and S is an area on which we want to analyze ﬁeld. This ﬁeld is
considered as known, e.g. from experiment, or from some kind of model - either analytical
or numerical.

The physical sense of representation (1) is extraction of spatial distributions which os-
cillate in time as a whole. The values |λi|2 give the part of ‘energy’ carried by i-th mode
in average. Physical origin of u(r, t) is of little importance — it could be electrical ﬁeld or
intensity of some kind of radiation, velocity proﬁle of ﬂow or even simply set of pictures u(r)
numbered by second variable t [5, 6]. In our case, u(r) is the slowly varied complex envelope

2

of the optical ﬁeld. One of the main parameters of presentation (1) is the number of terms
Nǫ, such that their sum contains not less that some prescribed part of the whole energy of
u(r, t)

Nǫ

Xi=1

|λi|2 > (1 − ǫ)

|λi|2.

∞

Xi=1

The other components with i > Nǫ bears noise or unimportant dynamics and so could be
excluded from consideration (on given interval of time and spatial domain).

As it could be shown, the decomposition functions could be found from two eigenproblems

for integral equations

and

where kernels are correlation function

|λi|2 ψi(r) =

dr′ φi(r′) KS(r, r′)

|λi|2 ai(t) =

dt′ ai(t′) Kt(t, t′)

KS(r, r′) =

dt u(r, t) u(r′, t)

KS(r, r′) =

dt u(r, t) u(r′, t).

and some kind of temporal correlation function, averaged over space

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

Equation (5) with kernel (7) is usually referred to as “method of snapshots” of “method of
strobes” [4].

On the other hand, decomposition of type (1), (2) corresponds to singular-value decom-
position [7] of “matrix” u(r, t). As far as experimental (or numerical calculation) data is
always is a kind of matrix of numbers. Appropriate discrete decomposition may be eﬀectively
calculated using standard svd routine available in umber of mathematical packages.

It should be noted, that whole decomposition could be found from just one eigenproblem,

while the dual basis, temporal or spatial, is found from projection

λi ai(t) =

dr φ∗

i (r) u(r, t),

λi ψi(r) =

dt a∗

i (t) u(r, t).

Use of eigenfunctions related to the investigated ﬁeld cause main positive sides of
Karhunen-Lo´eve expansion: among all sums of type (1) with ﬁnite number of terms, the
representation in terms of eigenfunctions ensures minimal least square error and the max-
imal capture of ”energy.” The KLD method proves its power on number of problems in
diﬀerent areas of physics and other sciences. On the other hand, its main drawback again
related with use of eigenfunctions: analytical solution of equations (4), (5) is known only for
very few special cases, the numerical solution often require too much resources and is inca-
pable to provide all the information about system dynamics, especially near critical points.

To this point, it is important to look for methods of analysis, which provide information
about spectrum of eigenvalues |λ|2 without calculation of decomposition itself [8].

However, calculation of Karhunen-Lo´eve decomposition provides valuable information
about the details of complex process. Solution of eigenvalue problem is usually much more
easy task than to study other, “standard” parameters of chaotic systems, such as Lyapunov
exponents or fractal dimensions. In most cases singular-value analysis enables to select just
the few most important components from whole spatio-temporal dynamics and to study
their behaviour.

3 Short description of the VCSEL model

Response of the active medium to the radiation in VCSEL is in a semiclassical approximation
is described by the spin-ﬂip model [1–3], taking into account vector character of ﬁeld:

where P is the polarization of the two level centers, P′ is the vector with components
(Py, −Px); N is the total population diﬀerence between the conduction and the valence bands
and N0 is its transparency value; n is the diﬀerence between the population diﬀerences for
the two allowed transitions between magnetic sublevels, δ = ωg − ωc is the detuning between
the bandgap frequency ωg and the cavity resonance ωc; γs is the decay rate between the
magnetic sublevels; T1 and T2 are the relaxation times for the total population diﬀerence
and the polarization correspondingly; |d| is the absolute value of the dipole momentum of
the transition (we suppose it is the same for both transitions); J is the pump parameter,

We will use equations (8) with adiabatically eliminated polarization. The procedure of
such adiabatic elimination is described in details in [1] and allows to take into account the
asymmetry of the gain line using so called linewidth enhancement factor α. In addition, this
procedure allows to avoid the short-frequency instabilities intrinsic to the straightforward
adiabatic elimination procedure for the spatially extended lasers. In this approximation the
polarization of the active medium is deﬁned as follows:

here D = N − N0, the operator ˆ£ ∼ £(~k⊥) = 1/[1 + T 2
resonance frequency for the tilted wave with deﬁnite ~k⊥, and the tilde means an equivalence
in the sense of transverse Fourier transform.

The propagation of radiation through the VCSEL cavity is calculated in an approximation
of thin ﬁlm active medium, which allows to neglect the diﬀraction in an active layer [1]. It
gives us the following relation:

Ei = ˆF Et.

where Ei is the ﬁeld incident into the active medium, Et is the ﬁeld outgoing from the active
medium. Operator ˆF = ρ exp(2ikL + i(∆⊥/k)L) Γ ˆR, where ρ describes absorption in the
linear medium between the active layer and reﬂector, L is the thickness of the spacer layer,
∆⊥ is the Laplasian in the transverse plane,

is an polarization anisotropy matrix, with γa, γp being the amplitude and phase anisotropy
parameters correspondingly. Operator ˆR describes the reﬂection of plane waves from the
Brag reﬂectors [1].

For numerical simulations we used the following parameters: γs = 100, γa = 0.1, γp = 0.0,
δ = 0.006, α = 3.0. For chosen parameters the lasing threshold is J0 = 0.730 which is needed
for the following discussion (see [1] for the detailed description of threshold conditions).

4 Analysis of VCSEL dynamics

We consider ﬁrst the simplest homogeneous case with periodic boundary conditions and with
small amplitude anisotropy. The resulting spatiotemporal regime near threshold (J = 0.740)
is regular and consists of stripes that weakly oscillate near certain equilibrium state (the
directions of oscillations is shown in Fig.1b by arrows). The contrast of stripes also changes
during the evolution. The KL-spectra of eigenvalues λj of the spatiotemporal regime for this
case is presented in Fig.1a. It is evident, that only two modes are the most signiﬁcant, while
all the others could be safely treated as zeros.

The spatial KL-modes appear to be stripes (Fig.2). Their maxima don’t coincide and
thus a spatial phase shift leads to orthogonality and to spatiotemporal dynamics. Hence,
the averaging over a large period of time leads to stripes with smaller contrast. Time depen-
dencies of the KL-modes (see Fig. 3) also characterized by regular (oscillating) dynamics,
except only some transient stage.

However, a slight enlarge of the injection current (up to J = 0.800) leads to chaotic time
dependency the ﬁeld. Nevertheless, in this case the KL-spectra has the same form as one
near threshold Fig. 1a, and, moreover, the spatial KL-modes are the same as in Fig. 2 too.
However, their temporal behavior is suﬃciently diﬀerent (see Fig.4).

Therefore, the chaotization of the regular dynamics appears due to mechanism, which
is not connected with excitation of the long-wavelength inhomogenities, either Eckhaus or
zig-zag type (i.e. in x or y directions).

Further increase of the injection current (J = 1.000) leads to more disordered dynamics.
More than two active modes are present in in KL-spectrum (Fig. 5). The spatial structure is
also changing in this case, and modulation in x direction now is accompanied by modulation
in y direction (see Fig. 6).

5 Conclusion

In summary, our calculations have shown, that during transition of VCSEL’s from the regular
behavior to spatio-temporal chaos, it still can be described by superposition of just a few
modes with relatively simple structure (for moderate values of the injection current). Increase
of order parameter (injection current J) leads to activation of some new modes, with new
features of transversal and temporal dependence.

Hence, the observed chaos is not truly “spatio-temporal”. Complex dynamics in time
domain (both for the electomagnetic ﬁeld itself and for KL-modes) is accompanied by just
very simple spatial structure of modes. Moreover, the whole dynamics is described by only a
few components. This fact, together with importance of VCSELs in modern optical commu-
nication, enables to suppose, that chaotic regimes could be eﬀectively controlled by adjusting
parameters of a system.

Abstract. Origin and properties of non-Lorentzian spectral lines in linear chains
of nanospheres are discussed. The lines are shown to be super-exponentially narrow
C(h/a)3] where C is a numerical constant, h
with the characteristic width
the spacing between the nanospheres in the chain and a the sphere radius. The ﬁne
structure of these spectral lines is also investigated.

One-dimensional periodic chains (ODPC) of metallic nanospheres have attracted
signiﬁcant recent attention due to their unusual optical properties. Although the general
theoretical framework for analyzing electromagnetic interactions in ODPC has been built
a decade ago [1], the recent dramatic advances in nanofabrication have reinvigorated the
interest in ODPC, which, in turn, has led to several new results of high experimental
relevancy. In particular, radiatively non-decaying surface plasmons (SPs) in ODPC with
possible applications to building novel lasers were discussed in Ref. [2]; unusual shifts of
plasmon resonance frequencies were found in Ref. [3] and a dramatic narrowing of SP
spectral lines was found in Ref. [4, 5] in ﬁnite chains of moderate length. In this letter I
show that two of these phenomena (unusual shifts and narrowing of SP spectral lines) are
directly related to a logarithmic divergence of dipole sums (electromagnetic eigenvalues)
- a theoretical interpretation that has not been given so far. The SPs that can be
excited as a result of this divergence posses highly unusual properties. In particular, the
resonance line-shapes are essentially non-Lorentzian and are characterized by a vanishing
integral weight. This is in a sharp contrast to spectral line broadening or narrowing due

to change in the decay rate. Another consequence which has not been previously noticed
is that each narrow resonance is paired with an even more narrow spectral hole. An
interesting new property discussed below is that the narrow collective SP resonances
can be excited in ODPCs even when the distance between neighboring spheres is much
larger than the sphere diameters. However, the resonances become so narrow in this
case that, unless one takes special care, it is extremely unlikely to notice them in any
numerical or experimental investigation.

We start with a brief summary of the underlying physics. The geometry of a
ODPC excited by a plane wave of the form E0 exp(ik
r) is illustrated in Fig. 1.
Here the polarization vector E0 is perpendicular to the chain, the incidence angle is
denoted by θ, lattice spacing by h and the sphere radius by a. Each sphere is assumed
to be polarizable and characterized by the dipole polarizability α. We work in the
approximation introduced by Doyle [6] in which each sphere is treated as an elementary
dipole located at its center but is characterized by non-quasistatic polarizability α which
is calculated from the coeﬃcient a1 of the Mie theory [7]:

where ψ1(x) and ξ1(x) are the Riccati-Bessel functions, m = √ǫ is the complex refractive
index of the spheres and k = ω/c = 2π/λ is the wave number of the incident wave. The
above approximation allows one to include spheres which are not small compared to
the incident wavelength λ while staying within the purely dipole theory. The higher
multipole interactions of the spheres, as well as the input of higher multipoles to the
optical cross sections, are ignored in this approximation. Note that the polarizability
α deﬁned by (1) is the exact dipole polarizability with respect to excitation by a plane
wave, but not by secondary waves scattered by spheres in the chain. However, the
dipole approximation was shown to be very accurate when h is the order of or larger
than 2a (which is the case discussed below) by direct comparison with a converged
T-matrix solution [4]. In general, it is known that short-range multipole interactions
of orders higher than the ﬁrst (dipole) do not play a signiﬁcant role for transverse
electromagnetic excitations of ﬁnite or inﬁnite linear arrays of interacting spheres even

when the spheres are in close proximity [8, 9]. Physically, one can argue that the short-
range interaction is not important for transverse excitations because it does not lead to
an electric current along the chain (in a sharp contrast to the longitudinal excitations
which are not discussed in the letter).

In the approximation formulated above, each sphere is characterized by a dipole
moment which, in the case of geometry shown in Fig. 1, is collinear with the polarization
vector E0 and has the amplitude dn, n being the index which labels spheres in the chain.
The amplitudes dn are coupled to the external ﬁeld and to each other by the coupled-

according to (1) for silver. Interpolated experimental dielectric function from [10] was
used in calculations.
It can be seen that in an isolated sphere, the SP (Frohlich)
resonance takes place in the interval 350nm < λ < 380nm, depending on the value
of a. The resonant wavelength is obtained from Re(a3/α) = 0. Above the Frohlich
resonance (at smaller wavelengths), the spectral variable Re(a3/α) becomes negative.
(Here we ignore the region λ < 320nm where no resonance excitation can take place
due to the strong interband absorption.) Therefore, in order to excite a SP in an
interacting ODPC in this spectral region, the variable ReS must be also negative. As
can be seen from Fig. 2(a), this happens for suﬃciently small values of the parameter
x = kh and corresponds to the conventional blue shift of the transverse electromagnetic
oscillations, which is well known and can be described by the quasistatic interaction [11].
However, below the Frohlich resonance (at larger wavelength), the spectral parameter
Re(a3/α) is positive. Therefore, in order to excite an SP in this spectral region, the
variable ReS must be also positive. Obviously, this requirement is fulﬁlled near the
points of divergence of ReS. Thus, if h/λ is close to an integer, the transverse collective
oscillations of the chain are shifted to the red from the Frohlich wavelength, contrary
to the usual case. Quite remarkably, the collective resonance can take place even if
a << h and (ka)3 << 1. Indeed, no matter how small ka is, the resonant condition can
always be satisﬁed suﬃciently close to the point λ = h/l. Below, we focus on the ﬁrst
h and can be experimentally observed in
of these resonances, which corresponds to λ

h is clearly visible. The curve is very close to the one shown
corresponding to λ
in Fig. 1(a) of Ref. [4].
In Fig. 3(b) the origin of the sharp resonance is illustrated.
Namely, we see that in a very narrow spectral interval near λ = 500nm real parts
of the two terms in the denominator of (7) cancel each other. From the analysis
of Fig. 3(b), it is obvious that there should be, in fact, two closely spaced narrow
resonances separated by a spectral hole. However, the ﬁrst of the two resonances is
suppressed due to radiative losses. The imaginary part of the denominator of (7)
is plotted in Fig. 3(c). As was pointed out in Ref. [1], the imaginary part of S(x)
experiences a jump at x = 2π. However, no exact cancellation of the imaginary part
of the denominator can take place. For the geometry considered here, it can be shown
that Im[(ka)3S(kh)] >

Let us estimate the width and amplitude of the narrow resonances occurring due
to the divergence of S(x). We deﬁne the width of the resonance as the distance
from the resonance wavelength λr, determined from the condition Re[a3/α(λr)

We estimate λr assuming that the dominant contribution to ReS comes from the
logarithmically diverging term (6). We also assume that ∆λ << 2π and expand the
argument of the cosine in (6) near the point x = kh = 2π, which leads to the following
estimate:

geometrical factors (the ratio h/a) and is not in any way controlled by relaxation. The
latter, however, inﬂuences amplitude of the resonance. Indeed, the maximum value of
Qe in the peak is given by 1/Im[a3/α
(ka)3S(kh)]. For the geometry considered here,
it can be veriﬁed that this value can not be greater than (h/πa)2, which is the limit
for nonabsorbing material. However, for strongly absorbing materials amplitude of the
resonance can become negligibly small.

Since the amplitude of the narrow resonances does not increase when the width
decreases super-exponentially, it is impossible to eﬀectively excite these resonances by
a near-ﬁeld probe. For example, consider the case when a single sphere (say, n = 0)
is excited by a near-ﬁeld microscope tip of small aperture. Then the coupled-dipole
equation for the amplitudes dn can be solved by Fourier transformation:

where ˜S(kh, qh) is given by (5) in which x sin θ in the argument of cosine must
be formally substituted by qh and the variable x in the reminder of the formula
substituted by kh. Function ˜S(kh, qh) diverges logarithmically when cos(kh) = cos(qh);
if kh = 2π as in the examples considered above, the only point of
in particular,
divergence within the integration interval is q = 0. Similarly to resonances in extinction
spectra, this resonance is super-exponentially narrow in the SP wavenumber q, and its
input into the above integral is negligible. We emphasize again that the resonances
discussed here are essentially non-Lorentzian, and the conditions for applicability of the
quasiparticle pole approximation, which under normal circumstances would properly
describe coupling of the near-ﬁeld probe to SPs, are severely violated.

The narrow resonance in Fig. 3(d) was obtained for h = 500nm and a = 50nm. We
now show that the narrow resonances also exist for smaller values of a and larger ratios
h/a. To this end, we plot the extinction eﬃciency Qe for h = 500nm and a = 45nm
[Fig 4(a)] and a = 40nm [Fig 4(b)]. The dielectric function does not vary noticeably
over the narrow spectral range shown in Fig. 4 and was therefore taken to be constant,
ǫ =
8.5 + 0.76i, which corresponds to the experimental value at λ = h = 500nm given
in Ref. [10]. The narrow non-Lorentzian resonances are well manifested in Fig. 4. The
central spectral hole is resolved to some degree in Fig. 4(a) but is shown only as a vertical
line in Fig. 4(b). Obviously, it is impossible to resolve the spectral holes completely,
since they do not have the Lorentzian structure and are non-diﬀerentiable at the point
λ = h. Note that the resonances shown in this ﬁgure are much more symmetrical with
respect to the point λ = 500nm than the one shown in Fig. 3(d). This is due to the
fact that with increasing the ratio h/a, the inﬂuence of radiative losses on the shape of
resonance lines decreases. For even larger values of h/a, the resonances quickly become
extremely narrow but do not disappear completely, at least in chains of suﬃcient length.
It is interesting to consider the possibility of narrow resonances in situations when
the dipole approximation is not applicable, i.e., for spheres in close proximity. It can
be shown that the resonances discussed in this letter do not disappear or get broadened
when the full multipole interaction is taken into account. Furthermore, the spherical
shape of the particles is also not fundamental because the phenomenon discussed here
originates due to long-range interaction in ODPC while the higher multipole interaction
is short-range. This conclusion is in agreement with the numerical study of extinction
spectra of periodic chains of cylindrical disks [5] which were shown to have sharp
resonances similar to those found in chains of spheres. Generalization to two-dimensional
arrays of particles is also possible. Two-dimensional periodically modulated structures
have also attracted signiﬁcant recent attention, with the possible application including
random lasers [2], development of novel chemical and biological sensors [3] and the study
of anomalous optical transmission through metal ﬁlms [12].

To conclude this letter, we discuss several factors that contribute to broadening
of the spectral lines discussed above. The most important factor is the ﬁnite length
of a chain, since the divergence of the dipole sums is logarithmic. As was mentioned
above, narrow resonances very close to those in inﬁnite chains were obtained in Ref. [4]

for h/a = 10 and only 50 spheres; however, observing more narrow resonances with
h/a > 10 will require a substantially larger number of spheres. One possible solution
to this problem is to place the ODPC into a circular optical ﬁber. Disorder is another
important factor. Numerical simulations in ﬁnite chains (400 particles) [5] revealed that
0.1h do not
random uncorrelated displacements of particles with the amplitude of
noticeably change the resonance lineshape. This is an expected result for short-range
disorder, i.e., the disorder with the correlation length of one or few lattice spacings.
However, disorder with long-range correlations can result is much stronger changes in
the resonance lineshapes. Further, the account of nonlocality of the dielectric response
will not alter the nature of positive interference (synchronism) which results in the
logarithmic divergences, and is not expected to broaden the narrow spectral lines.
The two physical phenomena whose eﬀects on the spectral lines discussed here are
diﬃcult to predict are the nonlinearity of the optical response (e.g., Kerr-type third-
order nonlinearity) and quantum eﬀects. These eﬀects will be the subject of future
work.

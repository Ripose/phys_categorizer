On the sensitivity of wave channeling of X-ray beam

to the shape of interface channels.

T.A.Bobrova, L.I.Ognev1

Abstract

The using of microdiﬀraction of X-ray radiation for analysis of the structure of material

specimens with submicron resolution becomes very promising investigation method [1]. One

of the methods for obtaining of submicron beams of hard X-ray radiation is formation in a

narrow channel of dielectrical resonator [1, 2]. In the present work the eﬀect of transmission of

X-ray through narrow submicron rough channels was investigated by numerical simulation with

account for diﬀraction and decay of coherency. It was found that transmission can be strongly

decreased for channels with periodic deformations. The eﬀects of roughnes were explained with

the statistical theory of X-ray scattering in rough transitional layer. The wave mode attenuation

coeﬃcients β scale as β ∼ 1/d3 (d is channel width) and proportional to roughness amplitude

σ. Possible explanation of observed anomalous energy dependence of transmission through thin

Cr/C/Cr channel was given. The sensitivity of transmission of dielectrical channel to the presence

of roughness and deformation with large space period was investigated.

The using of microdiﬀraction of X-ray radiation for analysis of the structure of material

specimens with submicron resolution becomes very promising investigation method [1].

One of the methods for obtaining of submicron beams of hard X-ray radiation is formation

in a narrow channel of dielectrical resonator [1, 2]. Monitoring of X-ray beam by capture

into a narrow dielectric channel is used in waveguide X-ray laser physics [3, 4], production

of thin X-ray probe beams [2] and other applications [5] due to the eﬀect of total external

reﬂection.

In this work we consider the role of diﬀraction that can be important for narrow

beams especielly when roughness is high. Scattering from surfaces with high roughness

needs special approach because small perturbation methods fail [6].

Theoretical model

X-ray scattering on rough surfaces is usually investigated within the well known

Andronov-Leontovich approach [7] but for very small angles of incidence the model of

”parabolic equation” for slowly varying scalar amplitudes of electrical ﬁeld vector A(x, z)

should be used. Within the model scattering and absorption do not disappear at small

grazing angle limit that results from Andronov-Leontovich approach [7]. In this case large

angle scattering is neglected so

∂2A(x, z)/∂z2 ≪ k · ∂A(x, z)/∂z

and because the beam is narrow

∂2A(x, z)/∂z2 ≪ ∂2A(x, z)/∂x2,

where z and x are coordinates along and across the channel. The consideration will be re-

stricted here to 2-dimensional channels (gaps) although the same approach can be applied

to capillaries. The assumption results in ”parabolic equation” of quazioptics [8]:

where k = √ε0

c . (In this case ε0 is dielectrical permittance of air, ε1 - dielectrical per-

mittance of glass.) The evolution of the channeled X-ray beam was calculated by direct

integration of the ”parabolic” equation [9]. The dielectric permitance on the rough bound-

ary with the random shape x = ξ(z) was presented as

ε(x, z) = ε1 + (ε0 − ε1)H(x − ξ(z)) where H(x) is a step function. The distribution of
roughness heights is assumed to be normal. It is known from results of [7] that at grazing

incidence the eﬀect of scatering is very small. So special surfaces are needed to observe

scattering eﬀects in the gap interface at reasonable distance. In the calculations we used

roughness amplitude up to 400˚A. The reﬂection of X-ray beam on very rough surfaces (up

to 1500 ˚A) of silicon was observed in[10]. The results of direct simulation of scattering

with the model rough surface by integration of equation (1) calculated for X-ray energy

E = 10keV , width of the channel d = 0.5µm, σ = 400˚A and correlation length of

roughness zcorr = 5µm averaged over 40 realizations are shown on Fig.1 as normalized to

initial value total intensity of the beam rtot, incoherent part rinc, where ri = R ∞

were taken from [11].

(curves 2 and 2′); ϑF /5 (curve 3 and 3′).

The main result of direct simulation is that the loss of coherency comes along with

attunuation of the beam and in the transmitted beam the coherent part prevails [8].

Analytical results for transmission of coherent part of X-ray can be obtained with

statistical averaging of equation (1) using Tatarsky method (see [12]) as it was made

in [8] by generalization of the method for stratiﬁed media. The same generalization of

the method to include stratiﬁed media was used in the case of electron channeling in

single crystals [13]. The method results in additional attenuation of coherent part of the

amplitude < A > due to ”scattering potential” W (x).

The decay of coherency for particular wave modes can be described with attenuation

coeﬃcients βl. Attenuation coeﬃcients can be found as overlap integrals

Statistically avaraged refraction and absorption are accounted for by normalized term

χ(x, z) = (< ε(x) > −ε0)/ε0.

It can be shown for lower channeled modes that incoherent scattering attenuation coeﬃ-

cient is proportional to σ (see discussion above about dependence of W (x) on σ)

The proportionality of losses of beam intensity to roughness amplitude σ under su-

permall gliding angles was obtained also in the numerical simulation results ([14], Fig.

5).

Results

The dependence of attenuation coeﬃcients β of X-ray beam on the channel width d

between silicon plates for three lower modes were shown in[15] and demonsrate β ∼ 1/d3

5

dependence. Such dependence accounts for decreasing of diﬀractional eﬀects with beam

width ∼ λ/d2 and the eﬀective portion of the beam that interacts with the surface ∼ σ/d.
When lead plates were taken into consideration instead of silicon the value of attenuation

coeﬃcients became 1.5 times greater. Increasing of β with decreasing of energy is stronger

than ∼ 1/E that can be accounted for by incresing of diﬀraction along with increasing of
optical density of channel walls.

Recently published experiments with Cr/C/Cr channel with length L = 3mm and

width d = 1620˚A of carbon layer [2] had shown nonmonotonous energy dependence of

transmision for ’0’ wave mode (Fig.2, rombs). As it was supposed [2] roughness of the

interfaces couldnot exceed ∼ 10˚A.

are shown by rombs.

Direct numerical simulation of the transmission of X-ray beam with equation (1) was

6

developed to investigate the dependence of ’0’ and ’1’ modes transmission on roughness

amplitude. The account for roughness decreases transmission of the basic mode with

E = 17keV by 1.3 % for σ = 10˚A and by 5 % for σ = 20˚A (see Fig.3 ) that cannot

explain prominent depression of experimental results on Fig.2.

Dependence of transmission of 17 keV X-ray beam in the chan-

nel Cr/C/Cr width C layer d = 1620˚A for modes ’0’ and ’1’ on

roughness σ, zcorr = 5µm.

For the expanation of anomalous dependence of 17keV radiation basic mode trans-

mision through Cr/C/Cr channels periodic deformation of the layers were taken into

acount. The results are shown on Fig.2 for deformation amplitude a = 120˚A and periods

Λ = 100µm (curve 1), 500µm (2) and 1000µm (3).

The dependence of transmission on deformation period Λ for E = 17keV a = 120˚A

and without roughness (the eﬀect of roughness was not important; see Fig.3 above) is

shown on Fig.4. Several resonanses can be recognised in short Λ region. So the results

shown on Fig.2 and Fig.4 are similar to the complicated eﬀects of strong wave function

transformation of channeled electrons in superlattices [9].

7

Thus the depression of the transmission for E = 17keV on Fig.2 observed in [2] can

be result of the periodic corrugation of Cr/C interface and wave mode interference.

To clear out the mechanism of decay of x-ray beam in thin ﬁlm waveguide with periodic

perpurbations both decay of total intensity and basic mode ”0” intensity on the distance

was investigated for diﬀerent periods Λ.

In the case of small scale perturbations (Λ ≤ 45µm) basic mode intensity decreases
nearly the same as the whole beam. And in the case of resonant perturbation Λ = 45µm

the intensity of basic mode is subjected to strong oscillations with the period Λ/2, de-

creasing at the distance z = 3000˚A to 0.03 part of the initial value. In the nonresonance

case Λ = 40µm the basic mode ”0” oscilations are substantial only near the entrance to

the carbon channel. Intensity at the distance z = 3000˚A on exit of the channel decreases

to 0.6 of the initial value.

For the period (Λ = 1000µm) the dependence of total intensity and basic mode ”0”

intensity are shown on Fig.5 with curves 2 (points) and 2′ (solid). Curves 1 and 1′ corre-

spond to the direct channel. Pulsations on the curve 1′ are due to calcuiation uncertainties.

From the Fig.5 it is seen that in the case of large scale perturbations the decreasing of

total intensity slightly diﬀeres from the streight channel. But decreasing of basic mode

having the oscilation manner with the period Λ/2, may reach nearly 0.1 of the initial

value. That is why the inﬂuence of large scale perturbations must result in substantial

increasing of angular spread of the beam at the exit of the channel.

Discussion

The investigations developed show strong inﬂuence of deformations of the channel on

the transmission of x-ray channeled beams. Small scale random perturbations of the sur-

face with the roughness amplitude up to 20˚A do not eﬀect considerably the transmission

8

of X-rays in comparison with diﬀraction eﬀects that determine the decay of intensity in

the channel in the case. The X-ray transmission is the most sensitive to the resonant

periodical perturbations of the channel corresponding to the pendulum oscillations of

modes ”0” and ”1”. In this case nearly complete dempening of the beam due to transfer

of basic mode ”0” to upper modes which decay rapidly[8, 15]. In the case of large periods

of deformations of the channel eﬀective transfer of the beam to the higher modes takes

place but it do not succed in substancial change of total intensity. It is worth noting that

the eﬀect of abnormal energy dependence of transmission of the beam through Cr/C/Cr

channel that was observed in [2] dissapeared after the technology of production of X-ray

waveguides was improved [16] that can serve as the conﬁrmation of the results of the

present work.

The results of the present work can be used for creation of new type of tunable X-ray

ﬁlters for formation of thin beams of synchrotron X-ray radiation.

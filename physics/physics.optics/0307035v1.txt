Abstract. We analyse theoretically for the ﬁrst time to our knowledge the perfect
phase matching of guided TE and TM modes with a multilayer waveguide composed
of linear isotropic dielectric materials. Alongside strict investigation into dispersion
relations for multilayer systems, we give an explicit qualitative explanation for
the phenomenon of mode matching on the basis of the standard one-dimensional
homogenization technique, and discuss the minimum number of
layers and the
refractive index proﬁle for the proposed device scheme. Direct applications of the
scheme include polarization-insensitive, intermodal dispersion-free planar propagation,
eﬃcient ﬁbre-to-planar waveguide coupling and, potentially, mode ﬁltering.

As a self-suﬃcient result, we present compact analytical expressions for the mode

dispersion in a ﬁnite, N -period, three-layer dielectric superlattice.

Dielectric multilayer waveguides for TE and TM mode matching

1. Introduction

Since the early experiments on mode conversion in ﬁlm-waveguide magneto-optical
systems [1, 2] and the subsequent theoretical works [3, 4, 5] it has become clear that an
equality between propagation constants of the two guided modes—otherwise called mode
matching or perfect phase matching—can be realized exclusively due to the tensorial
character of dielectric permittivity of the waveguiding slab, i.e. due to its either natural
or induced anisotropy. An obvious way to gain anisotropy is to produce a waveguide
layer of monocrystalline material possessing intrinsic birefringence; another possibility
is provided by use of gyrotropic waveguides (for example, YIG on GGG) subject to an
external DC magnetic ﬁeld. Historically, it was the latter way that experimentalists
followed, probably because of its higher ﬂexibility and technical reliability. A number
of device schemes implementing that principle were rapidly proposed, from an optical
switch [1] to a sensitive experimental method of determining the permittivity tensor
elements [3]. The two unpleasant drawbacks were then the complexity of the schemes
and the comparatively high absorption in gyrotropic ﬁlms that hindered their utilization,
e.g. for intermodal dispersion-free planar propagation.

On the other hand,

in recent years a certain interest in traditional multilayer
dielectric mirrors from the viewpoint of photonic bandgap localization has been
observed, stimulated probably by the unexpected discovery of total omnidirectional
reﬂection from an appropriately designed one-dimensional dielectric lattice, i.e. an
actual photonic band gap exhibited in case of such a simple geometry [6, 7, 8, 9]. What
looks now curious but is important for the purpose of the present treatment is that one
can easily see the points of perfect phase matching of TE and TM modes on the standard
band structure diagrams of dielectric multilayers [10, ch 4], yet unfortunately little or
no attention has been paid in the literature to those mode matching phenomena—in
spite of so many promising applications including polarization-insensitive, intermodal
dispersion-free planar waveguiding, eﬃcient ﬁbre-to-planar waveguide coupling and,
potentially, mode ﬁltering, drastic improvement of mode conversion eﬃciency and
diﬀraction eﬃciency in magneto-optical Bragg cells and others. To the best of our
knowledge, the underlying idea that a multilayer waveguide can be regarded as a
homogeneous, eﬀectively anisotropic slab—and as if it were the case of a naturally
birefringent or gyrotropic, magnetized waveguide, the perfect phase matching of TE
and TM modes must occur—has been formulated just recently [11].

The aim of the current paper is to highlight and theoreticallly investigate the perfect
phase matching of guided TE and TM modes with a multilayer device composed of
linear, isotropic, non-magnetic and non-absorbing materials. The paper is organized
as follows. Section 2 is devoted mainly to qualitative models and considerations: we
begin with a transparent explanation for the mode matching phenomenon on the basis
of conventional one-dimensional homogenization method and then discuss the general
eigenproblem for TE and TM modes in order to derive some basic requirements for the
scheme, such as the minimum number of layers and the proper refractive index proﬁle.

Strict analytical expressions for the modal dispersion structure of periodic dielectric
stacks with two-layer and three-layer unit cells follow those qualitative speculations and
are given in section 3. Finally, we analyse in section 4 several examples of perfect phase
matching with simple planar structures composed of silicon and silicon-nitride layers,
fully compatible with modern integrated optics techniques.

2. What is mode matching by a multilayer dielectric waveguide?

A straightforward way to make the idea of perfect phase matching transparent is to
consider a stack of isotropic dielectric layers as an eﬀectively homogeneous, uniaxially
birefringent medium, by means of the standard one-dimensional homogenization
technique. This approach allows to expand the argumentation for the mode matching
with anisotropic waveguides to the case of dielectric multilayers, with an important
consequence that the mode matching is in principle possible with those structures too.
To ﬁnd the minimum number of layers required for the matching and to optimize the
refractive index proﬁle, we furthermore analyse the waveguiding conditions for TE and
TM modes in multilayer structures, tracking the fruitful analogy with conﬁned one-
dimensional electron states problem quite profoundly investigated in the framework of
classical quantum mechanics and solid-state physics.

2.1. Eﬀective medium treatment

In a single-layer isotropic waveguide, the two given modes—TE (s-polarized) and TM
(p-polarized)—are commonly characterized at a ﬁxed frequency by deﬁnitely diﬀerent
propagation angles θs,p between the wavevector and the plane of the guide, and
consequently, by diﬀerent (non-equal) propagation constants βs,p via

where n is the refractive index of the waveguiding medium and the subscripts s and
p diﬀerentiate between TE and TM modes. Anisotropy of the waveguide accounts
evidently for the following modiﬁcation of equation (1):

βs,p = n cos θs,p ,

βs,p = ns,p(θ) cos θs,p ,

where ns,p are the indices ‘seen’ by TE and TM modes, and a situation like that in
ﬁgure 1 becomes possible, when the projections of the wave vectors of diﬀerent modes
onto the plane of guidance coincide, giving rise to the phenomenon of mode matching.
Consider now a two-component periodic multilayer system consisting of layers of
dielectric permittivity ǫ1 = n2
1 and thickness t1 separated by layers with permittivity
ǫ2 = n2
2 and thickness t2. If a plane wave is incident onto this array with its electric vector
E polarized parallel to the layers (TE-wave) and the thicknesses t1 and t2 are small
compared to the wavelength, then one may introduce the eﬀective dielectric permittivity
of the array as [12]

and if the magnetic vector H is parallel to the plates (TM-wave), then the eﬀective
permittivity becomes [12]

ǫp =

(t1 + t2) ǫ1 ǫ2
t1 ǫ1 + t2 ǫ2

.

This treatment allows one to state that two isonormal, s- and p-polarized waves
‘see’ in general diﬀerent refractive indices of eﬀective waveguiding medium, hence if to
start from the isotropic (n1 = n2) case and then change one of the indices, the families of
TE and TM dispersion curves will undergo non-equal shifts on the dispersion structure
diagram and thus intersect at a number of points, displaying the modes degeneration—
the perfect phase matching. One should remember by the way that it is of course not
complete, spatial degeneration of modes, but mere propagation constant coincidence.

The question that naturally arises here is: How much layers are enough for the
mode matching to occur? In other words: When does the reasoning based on the form
birefringence approach lose its validity? To answer these questions and to elucidate
the physics of mode matching in the case of a ﬁnite number of layers, one may ﬁnd
it convenient to employ an explicit mathematical analogy between conﬁned photon
and electron states, the latter being quite thoroughly investigated in classical quantum
mechanics and solid-state physics—a comprehensible 1D Kronig–Penney model should
certainly be mentioned here as an example.

2.2. Dispersion equation for TE and TM modes as an eigenproblem: Qualitative
analysis

As is commonly known and excellently described by Joannopoulos et al
[10, ch 3],
symmetry considerations allow us to separate the modes of planar dielectric waveguides
into two classes: TE and TM polarized. In a coordinate system in which the x-axis is
normal to the bimedium interfaces and the light propagates along the z-direction, we
can write for TE and TM polarizations, respectively,

E(r) = exp(i

βz)φE(x)y

ω
c

and

H(r) = exp(i

βz)φH(x)y,

ω
c

where ω is the angular frequency, c is the vacuum speed of light, β is what we
call the propagation constant, φE(x) and φH(x) are the unknown ﬁeld distributions.
Substituting one of these ﬁelds into corresponding Maxwell wave equation, in the case of
permittivity ǫ(r) = ǫ(x) being a step-wise function equal to n2
j for the jth homogeneous
layer we obtain the following eigenproblem:

d2φ(x)
dx2 +

ω2
c2 (n2

j − β2)φ(x) = 0.

This is the dispersion equation for a multilayer waveguide; the diﬀerence between TE
and TM polarizations lies exclusively in diﬀerent boundary conditions at the interfaces
of the layers. Thus, at the interface x = x0 we have:

φE(x−

0 ) = φE(x+

0 ),

φH(x−

Conditions for the derivatives originate from continuity of z-components of magnetic
and electric ﬁeld vectors via Maxwell equations for ∇ × E and ∇ × H respectively.

Note that the scalar Helmholtz wave equation (7) with boundary conditions for
the TE mode (8) is isomorphous to the familiar stationary one-dimensional Schr¨odinger
equation

corresponding to eigenfunctions ψE (x).

functions leads to strict alternation of TE and TM dispersion curves of one- and two-

of conﬁned TE modes are always separated by those of TM ones. This ‘rule’ can be
illustrated by ﬁgure 2 for the lowest modes in a single-layer waveguide: the ratio λ/2d (λ
is the wavelength within the guide) for the φE(x) function of the TE0 mode is obviously
more than that for the TM0 mode because of the steeper slopes of the φH(x) function
near the interfaces due to the boundary conditions, but however high the refractive index
of the guide and consequently the slopes of φH(x) function in vicinity of the interfaces
may be, the ratio λ/2d for the TM0 mode will never drop below unity, while for the
next TE mode—TE1—it is deﬁnitely less than 1, actually lying between 1/2 and 1.

Similar argumentation still holds for the modal dispersion structure of a two-layer
stack, no matter of the refractive index contrast of the layers, and, in general, for N-layer
stack with refractive indices of the layers regularly increasing or decreasing throughout
the array (n1 < n2 < . . . < nN or n1 > n2 > . . . > nN ).

Surprisingly, a three-layer waveguide of step-wise refractive index proﬁle develops
considerably diﬀerent from the above case, provided the second layer is of lower refractive
index then its surroundings: n2 < n1,3. Also assume for the sake of simplicity n1 = n3
and, as before, symmetric sandwiching: n0 = 1 for both ambient media. As it will now
be argued, the mode matching can be eﬀectively implemented with such a system; to
understand its origin, it might be a helpful trick to recall the changes in the system of
eigenfunctions ψE (x) of an electron in one-dimensional three-step potential gap, each
step being of width d/3:

otherwise (in the lateral regions)

with increasing U2 from U2 = U1,3 to U2 = U0 that corresponds to decreasing n2 from
n2 = n1,3 (isotropic single-layer waveguide) to unity (two waveguide channels separated
by air region), the frequency ω being ﬁxed.

While the diﬀerence between U1,3 and U2

correspondent to ψE (x) eigenfunctions compose a relatively regular discrete energy
spectrum, and so do the propagation constants of TE modes at any ﬁxed frequency.
The TM mode spectrum is a bit shifted with respect to the TE one due to the diﬀerence

propagation constants of TE and TM modes are strictly alternating.

By contrast, when U2 is large enough, the regions of low potential become weakly
coupled, the entire system possessing the twofold (generally N-fold, where N is the
number of regions of low potential—or high refractive index) splitting of mixed odd
and even energy levels corresponding to nearly degenerate TE modal groups of N
modes each. TM modes also form similar N-fold groups which are, however, shifted

extremes, or equivalently, for certain frequency ω in case of n2 being somewhat less
than n1,3 and ﬁxed, the matching of TE and TM modes should be expected, with the
only exception for TE0 mode in agreement with the inevitably negative character of
form birefringence [12, 13]. We can also anticipate herefore that the minimum suﬃcient
number of layers for the perfect phase matching is three, provided the central layer is of
lower refractive index than the surrounding ones—see ﬁgure 3 for an example of such
a structure. More generally, the refractive index proﬁle of the waveguide should have
more than one maximum for the eﬀective mode matching.

Consider now a kind of three-layer system ‘reciprocal’ to the above—with a middle
layer being of higher index than the lateral ones. For this third possible arrangement of
the layers, the mode matching is not forbidden, yet there is seemingly no solid ground to
expect the matching of the lowest modes now since such a system appears to stand close
to conventional slab waveguide—the latter with no possibility for the mode matching
at all. More thorough analysis in the manner above for a single-layer waveguide shows
that coincidence of propagation constants should be expected for the modes of the same
order , but as before with the exception of TE0 and TM0 modes. It is demonstrated in
section 4 that the mode matching is indeed observed in this case only in the multimode
regime, thus actually losing its practical value.

3. Dispersion analysis for multiperiod two- and three-layer waveguides

The general form (7)–(9) of the dispersion equations for guided modes is quite good
for qualitative analysis, but inconvenient for numerical investigations into the TE and
TM mode spectra of multilayer stacks.
In the current section we render the known
dispersion relations for multiperiod bilayer waveguides and present their generalization
for three-layer multiperiod systems. Thus, following Yeh [14], in case of an N-period
stack with a bilayer unit cell one has for TE modes:

Three-layer semi-inﬁnite dielectric superlattices have been studied earlier, but with
the focus on the existence and the dispersion of bulk and surface polaritons [15]. In the
case of a ﬁnite, N-period stack with a trilayer unit cell one can however quite trivially
derive the following dispersion relation for the guided TE modes (see the appendix for

Of course, certain symmetries could obviously be found in these equations, but still
the latter seem to be too cumbersome for any qualitative speculations. Instead, one can
easily do now plenty of computational work related to physically realizable multilayers,
and in the following section we will do that with waveguides made of such popular
optical materials as silicon and its compounds.

4. Simulated results for multilayers of silicon and silicon nitride

To demonstrate the performance of dielectric multilayers for the mode matching and
to corroborate theoretical considerations presented in section 2, we have plotted in
ﬁgure 4 the modal dispersion curves of (a) two-layer Si/Si3N4 and (b) three-layer
Si/Si3N4/Si waveguides, as well as of (c,d) their two-period counterparts. Silicon and its
nitride have been chosen deliberately since these materials are found to be suitable for
manifold passive optical components like branching waveguides, couples, interconnects,
interferometers, power splitters, and ﬁlters [16, 17]. We employed here the mode
dispersion relations for bilayer and three-layer waveguides and their generalization for
multiperiod systems, equations (12)–(19). The thicknesses of the layers were assumed to
be equal; the refractive indices are 3.5 (Si), 2.0 (Si3N4) and 1.5 (SiO2). All the numerical
calculations were performed with Mathematica 4.1 [18].

(d) ﬁve-layer (Si/Si3N4/Si)2 waveguides, all on silica substrate.

Figure 4(a) is of no particular interest—we see the system of TE and TM dispersion
curves that is quite typical for slab dielectric waveguides, with just slight perturbations
of the high-order modal curves near β ≈ 2—that is close to the refractive index of
the middle layer. In contrast, ﬁgure 4(b) reveals the predicted intersection of modal
dispersion curves for the three-layer system; for the ﬁrst phase-matching point where
the TM0 mode matches TE1 at NT = 0.25λ (here T is the total thickness of one period,
so that NT gives the thickness of the whole structure), we can estimate the thicknesses
of the layers to be t1 = t2 = t3 = 130 nm for operation near 1.55 µm, i.e.
in the
spectral range for telecommunication frequencies.
In order to improve the operation
bandwidth, the slopes of dispersion curves at the given point of intersection must be
as close as possible, and for that purpose the refractive index distribution should be
further optimized.

The comparison between ﬁgures 4(b), (c) and (d) conﬁrms that it is the number
of layers of high refractive index, and not periods—which sometimes are more ‘mental’
constructs than ‘physical’ objects—that determines the number of modes in the TE and
TM bands formed. Thus, for both Si/Si3N4/Si and (Si/Si3N4)2 structures constituted of
two silicon layers—two ‘potential gaps’ for photons—the twofold grouping of modes at
high β values is clearly observed. Finally, ﬁgure 5 testiﬁes to the statement of section 2

that for the eﬀective mode matching, the refractive index of the medium layer in three-
layer waveguide should be low enough; otherwise, the matching is not forbidden, but
occurs only for high-order modes and remains thus impracticable.

5. Conclusion

In summary, the perfect phase matching of TE and TM guided modes with a multilayer
waveguide composed of linear isotropic dielectric materials has been anticipated and
simulated for the ﬁrst time. Dielectric superlattices with unit cells of two types have been
considered: two-layer and tree-layer; for ﬁnite, N-period, three-component structures,
the compact analytical expressions for the mode dispersion have been derived, which
can be regarded as a self-suﬃcient result.

Numerical simulations performed for a silicon—silicon-nitride—silicon waveguide
on a silica substrate bear witness that even a three-layer stack can be designed to
exhibit at certain frequencies the perfect phase matching of TE and TM guided modes.
Since the TE and TM mode spectra are naturally very sensitive to refractive index
distribution, i.e. to the index contrast of the layers and their thicknesses, number and
succession, wide possibilities arise to tailor the mode dispersion in the vicinity of those
phase-matching points.

The principle of perfect phase matching with a multilayer dielectric array has
implementations in polarization-insensitive planar propagation,
important potential
ﬁbre-to-planar waveguide coupling, mode conversion, ﬁltering etc. The advantage of
the presented device scheme is its simplicity and compatibility with common integrated
optics techniques, e.g. with planar optical waveguide technology. Further important
issues to be addressed for the development of applicational aspects of the scheme are
optimization with a more advanced refractive index proﬁle of the waveguiding stack and
integration into complex, state-of-the-art optical and optoelectronic elements.

Appendix

To derive the mode dispersion relation for the ﬁnite, N-period, three-layer dielectric
superlattices, one can simply follow Yeh’s [14] reasoning for bilayer multiperiod
waveguides, yet we prefer to utilize another tool here—the general, dyadic-based
formalism for stratiﬁed media [19] which proves to be a competitive modiﬁcation of
Berreman 4 × 4 matrix approach [20] and can be directly applied to more complicated
problems of light scattering and conﬁned propagation in, e.g., magnetized, metallo-
dielectric and anisotropic arrays.

Consider an N-period three-layer stack sandwiched between isotropic, homoge-
neous, semi-inﬁnite media—a substrate of permittivity ǫSub and a cover of permittivity
ǫCov. The covariant dispersion relation for plane-stratiﬁed media [19] takes the form

where I = z ⊗ z + y ⊗ y is the unit 2-D dyadic, z and y are the unit vectors in the plane
of the guide, respectively parallel and perpendicular to the direction of propagation,
a ⊗ b denotes the outer product aαbβ, Pj is the evolution operator (4 × 4 matrix)
that relates z and y components of electric and magnetic ﬁelds arranged into truncated
x × E = (−Ez, Ey)T and Hτ = (Hy, Hz)T vectors at the interfaces x = xj and x = xj−1
of the jth layer,

Such a simple structure of operators Pj and γSub,Cov permits us to decompose
dispersion equation (A1) into two separate equations—for TE and TM modes; these
are obtained via multiplying zP1, zP2, zP3 or xP1, xP2, xP3 and applying the known
representation of Nth power of a 2 × 2 unimodular matrix in terms of the Chebychev
polinomials of the second kind given by Abel`es [21]. Finally, this cumbersome, but
physically transparent procedure results in equations (16)–(19).

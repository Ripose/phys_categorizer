Abstract

Novel optical microcavities based on zero-group-velocity surface modes in photonic crystals are

proposed and demonstrated. It has been shown that high quality factors can be easily obtained

for such microcavities in photonic crystal slabs. With increasing of the cavity length, the quality

factor is gradually enhanced and the resonant frequency converges to that of the zero-group-

velocity surface mode in the photonic crystal. Diﬀerent from a conventional cavity, the number of

the resonant modes is ﬁxed despite the cavity length, determined only by the number of surface

modes with zero group velocity.

Optical microcavities have attracted much attention due to their potential applications in

many various ﬁelds, such as ultra-small optical ﬁlters, high eﬃciency light emission diodes,

low threshold lasers, nonlinear optics and quantum information precessing [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

6]. All applications require microcavities to conﬁne light strongly and densely, that is,

microcavities should have both high quality factor Q and small modal volume V . Total

internal reﬂection (TIR) and/or Bragg reﬂection are generally used for light conﬁnement.

For the smaller cavity, Q is greatly reduced. One of the best approaches to resolve the

problem is the extension of the Bragg reﬂection in a two-dimensional (2D) or a three-

dimensional (3D) photonic crystal (PhC) [7]. It has been also shown that extremely small-

mode-volume high-Q microcavities can be realized by two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystal

slabs [2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], owing to strong optical conﬁnement for both in-plane and vertical

direction.

Surface waves are propagating electromagnetic waves, which are bound to the interface

between materials and free space. For dielectric interfaces, they usually do not exist on

dielectric materials. However, due to the existence of photonic band gaps, it has been shown

that dielectric photonic crystals may support surface waves for some cases, e.g., a truncated

or deformed structure at the interface [13]. In the present letter, utilizing surface modes

with zero group velocity, we propose and demonstrate novel photonic crystal microcavities

with high Q. Though the concepts apply for all photonic crystals, for simplicity, only surface

resonant modes in 2D PhC slabs are considered in this letter. These cavities are open cavities

in the sense that one of the in-plane boundaries is exposed to exterior.

Let us ﬁrst consider a 2D square photonic crystal slab with dielectric rods in air. The

permittivity of the rods is ε = 11.56, the height of the rods is 2a, and the radius of the

rods is R = 0.2a, where a is the lattice constant. Surface defects at the interface (ﬁlled

by red) are introduced by reducing the radius of rods (Rd = 0.15a), top-view of which is

illustrated in the inset of Fig. 1 (a). The dispersion relation for the reduced-radii rod-slab

transverse magnetic (TM) surface modes is calculated using the 3D ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-

domain (FDTD) method [14] and is shown in Fig. 1 (a), where the shadow regions are the

projected band structure for TM modes. It can be seen from Fig. 1 (a) that such a surface

structure only supports one surface mode. Group velocity governed by vg =

kω for the

∇

surface mode is zero for the wave vector k = π/a (mode A). Suppose an optical microcavity

that is composed by the 2D square PhC slab, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). The color-ﬁlled rods,

2

acting as reﬂecting mirrors in the y direction, are the same as those interior rods. The length

of the cavity is denoted by L. Surface modes can go through the central surface but are

terminated by the reﬂecting mirror. Only the mode for obeying the Fabry-Perot condition

(the round-trip accumulated phase Φ = 2kL + 2∆φ is a multiple of 2π, where ∆φ is the

phase shift associated with reﬂection from the boundary) will stay in the cavity for a long

time, i.e., become a surface resonant mode. For such a microcavity, with no absorption by

the material, the quality factor Q is mainly determined by the reﬂection loss at the interface

between the surface defect rods (red ones) and the mirror rods (green ones).

Quality factors and resonant frequencies of surface resonant modes are analyzed by the

3D FDTD method [14] with a boundary treatment of perfectly matched layers [15]. We

excite the surface mode with a Gaussian pulse and then monitor the radiative decay of the

ﬁeld. The frequencies ω and quality factors Q of the resonant modes are calculated using

a combination of FDTD techniques and Pad´e approximation with Baker’s algorithm [16].

In Fig. 3 (a), we show the electric ﬁeld cross sections of a high-Q surface resonant mode

for the square photonic crystal slab cavity with the length of L = 11a. Fig. 3 (a) depicts

horizontal and vertical cross sections of the electric-ﬁeld z component at the center plane

of third axis (z = 0) and at the plane center of the surface defects, where the dotted line

frequency 0.3599(a/λ) and quality factor Q = 1.24

represents the position of the surface defect rods with Rd = 0.15a. The mode has an angular
104 and
×
104 (1/Q = 1/Q⊥ + 1/Qk). It can be clearly seen from Fig. 3 (a) that the

104, in which Qk = 8.93

Q⊥ = 1.44

×

resonant mode is really governed by wave vector k = π/a, which is consistent with what we

×

analyzed above.

The results of Q for the square PhC microcavity with diﬀerent cavity length are shown in

Fig. 4 (a). Our results show that there is only one resonant mode as the cavity length varies

and the cavity mode is related to the same zero-group-velocity surface mode (Note that for a

conventional cavity the number of resonant modes will increase as the cavity size increases).

From Fig. 3 (a), one can see that the electric ﬁeld is almost concentrated in the centers of

defect rods. We believe that the reﬂection phase shift ∆φ is close to π, which is roughly

independent of the cavity length L. Thus, the Fabry-Perot resonance condition can always

be met for the mode A with k = π/a. It can be seen from Fig. 4 (a) that Q gradually

increases as the cavity length becomes larger. Our results also show, with increasing of

the cavity length, that the angular frequency of the surface resonant mode converges to

3

ω0, corresponding to that with the zero-group-velocity surface mode in the photonic crystal

slab.

Let us next consider a triangular photonic crystal slab with air holes extending through

a high-index ( ε = 11.56) ﬁnite-height dielectric slab, top-view of which is shown in the

inset of Fig. 1 (b). The holes have a radius of 0.30a, while the high-index slab is of

thickness 0.6a. The distance between right boundary and the centers of the ﬁrst right holes

is d = √3a/2. The dispersion relation for such a triangular PhC slab transverse electric

(TE) surface modes is shown in Fig. 1 (b), where the shadow regions are the projected band

structure for TE modes. One can see from Fig. 1 (b) that there exist three surface mode

curves in the triangular PhC slab. For simplicity, we only consider the angular frequency

between 0.26(a/λ) and 0.30(a/λ), where there is one surface mode (red dotted line) in a

large region. Two zero-group-velocity surface modes (mode A with k1 = π/a and mode B

with k2 = 0.71π/a) can be found in our considered frequency region. Thus we expect the

cavity composed by the triangular PhC slab will have two surface resonant modes, diﬀerent

from the square PhC slab cavity. Now imagine an optical cavity composed by such a 2D

triangular PhC slab, as shown in Fig. 2 (b). The reﬂecting mirrors in y direction are

introduced by enlarging the radius of surface holes to 0.33a, together with the dielectric

background. Using method mentioned above, we do ﬁnd two surface resonant modes with

the cavity length of L = 11a. One of the mode (corresponding to mode A) has a resonant
103 and another (corresponding to mode
104. Figures 3 (b) and 3 (c) show the magnetic-ﬁeld

angular frequency 0.2816(a/λ) , quality factor 9.81

B) is ω = 0.2841(a/λ) , Q = 3.41

cross sections for the two resonant modes with the frequency of 0.2816(a/λ) and 0.2841(a/λ),

respectively. The upper ﬁgure and bottom ﬁgure represent the horizontal and vertical cross

sections of the magnetic ﬁeld at the center plane of third axis (z = 0) and at the vertical yz

plane (the distance between surface boundary and the plane is 0.3a), respectively.

Our results show that, when the cavity length increases, the frequencies of the resonant

modes converge to those two surface modes with zero-group-velocity. However, Q values

ﬂuctuate as the cavity length L increases, as shown in Fig. 4(b), where the diamond line

and the asterisk line represent the results for mode A and mode B, respectively. As described

in Ref.

[17], Q should be enhanced when Φ = 2kL + 2∆φ is multiple of 2π. Due to the

complicated reﬂection interfaces, as seen in Fig. 2(b), the reﬂection phase shift ∆φ is not

close to π for the both modes, diﬀerent from the case of the square lattice. Furthermore, for

4

the cavity length with numbers of lattice constant, 2kL is not anymore close to a multiple

of 2π for the mode B with k = 0.71π/a. Peaks of Q appear when Φ is close to a multiple of

2π. The positions of peaks for the mode A are diﬀerent with those for the mode B, mainly
104
104 when L = 16a. If the cavity length is further increased,

arisen from the diﬀerent wave vectors for the two resonant modes. QA reaches at 9.78

when L = 18a and QB is 5.73

×

Q values will again ﬂuctuate but in average increasing.

In this letter, we propose and demonstrate novel optical microcavities based on zero-

group-velocity surface modes in photonic crystals. High quality factor can be easily obtained

for such surface-mode microcavities. We also study the inﬂuence of the microcavity length

to the quality factor and resonant frequency.

It has been shown that, with increasing of

the cavity length, the quality factor is gradually enhanced and resonant angular frequency

converges to ω0, corresponding to that for the zero-group-velocity surface mode in photonic

crystals. Diﬀerent from conventional cavities, the number of the resonant modes is ﬁxed in

spite of the cavity size. The number is only determined by the number of surface modes

with zero group velocity. It is well known that surface plasmons exist on a metal-dielectric

interface. We believe similar ideas can be applied to metallic structure to obtain surface

resonant modes.

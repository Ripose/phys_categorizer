Photonic Approach to Making a Left-Handed Material

Gennady Shvets
Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL 60616, and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL 60520

A new approach to producing a composite material with negative refraction index is demon-
strated. It is shown that a photonic structure which consists of two dielectric materials, with positive
and negative dielectric permittivities, can support electromagnetic waves which exhibit the unusual
electromagnetic property of left-handedness (or negative refraction index). These electromagnetic
waves are the surface waves localized at the dielectric interfaces. Depending on the geometry of the
photonic structure, the composite left-handed material can be either isotropic, or anisotropic.

Left-handed materials (LHMs) [1] with negative mag-
netic permeability µ and dielectric permittivity ǫ have
recently attracted a great deal of attention because of
their promise for developing novel lenses and low re-
ﬂectance surfaces [2,3]. LHMs have a negative refrac-
tive index, which implies that the phase and group ve-
locities of the propagating electromagnetic wave oppose
each other. This property of LHMs is responsible for
their anomalous physical behavior: reversed sign of the
Doppler eﬀect and counter-intuitive refraction at the in-
terface with the ”normal” (right-handed) media [1].

LHM by creating a photonic structure consisting of di-
electric regions with ǫ < 0 separated by thin vacuum
gaps. Left-handedness of such structures is due to the
existence of the surface waves at the vacuum/dielectric
interfaces. Dielectrics and semiconductors which have
a negative ǫ within a ﬁnite frequency range are rather
common, and include many polar crystals such as SiC,
LiTaO3, LiF, and ZnSe. The frequency-dependent dielec-
tric permittivity of these crystals, given by the approxi-
mate formula [7] ǫ = ǫ∞(ω2
T ), is negative
−
for ωT < ω < ωL. So is the dielectric constant of a free-
p/ω2, where ωp is the
ω2
electron gas, given by ǫ = 1
plasma frequency, for ω < ωp.

The organization of the Letter is schematically shown
in Fig. 1. First, a single dielectric waveguide (SDW)
with ǫc < 0 dielectric cladding (Fig. 1(a)), is shown to
exhibit left-handedness due to the existence of the sur-
face waves at the vacuum-cladding interface. The eﬀec-
tive ǫeﬀ and µeﬀ of the waveguide are shown to be neg-
ative (see Fig. 2). Of course, surface waves can only
propagate along (and not across) the waveguide walls.
Thus, I next consider a stack of dielectric waveguides
(Fig. 1(b)), which supports waves propagating in all di-
rections. Only the waves propagating in a range of direc-
~vph < 0 property (where
tions, however, exhibit the ~vg
vg and vph are the group and phase velocities). There-
fore, the waveguide stack (WS) is not a proper LHM,
and the two-dimensional photonic waveguides shown in
Fig. 1(c,d) are considered as the further reﬁnement of the
concept. The square lattice photonic waveguide (SLPW)
turns out to be a highly anisotropic LHM, with the an-
gle α = 6 (~vph, ~vg) always satisfying π/2 < α < 3π/2
but strongly dependent on the propagation direction
(see Fig. 4). The triangular lattice photonic waveguide
(TLPW) is found to be a perfectly isotropic LHM for
small wavenumbers kx,y
π/d, where d is the lattice
periodicity. Recently [8], it has been suggested that the
group velocity in LHMs is not aligned with the phase
velocity, making the perfect lens impossible. It is con-
structively demonstrated that this is not the case even
for an artiﬁcially constructed LHM shown in Fig. 1(d).

To illustrate how a negative µ can be mimicked using
only dielectrics, consider electromagnetic wave propaga-
tion in the horizontal (x) direction in a dielectric waveg-

cladding, shaded regions represent vacuum channels.

Since materials with µ < 0 do not naturally occur,
LHM has to be artiﬁcially constructed. An LHM in the
microwave frequency band was recently constructed as an
array consisting of metal rods (which provided ǫ < 0 [4])
and split-ring resonators (which provided µ < 0 [5]).
Photonic structures have also been known to exhibit neg-
ative group velocity due to the band folding eﬀect [6].
In this Letter I introduce a new concept of making an

where the eﬀective dielectric permittivity and magnetic

The deﬁnition of the weight-averaged ǫ is intuitive, and
µeﬀ is deﬁned so as to eliminate the longitudinal compo-
nent of the electric ﬁeld Ex which does not contribute to
the power ﬂow along the waveguide.

Equations (1) yield k2

xc2/ω2 = µeﬀ ǫeﬀ, necessitating
that ǫeﬀ and µeﬀ be of the same sign for a propagat-
ing wave. Note that µeﬀ is a complicated function of
the channel width, frequency, and the dielectric constant
of the cladding, and could generally be either positive
or negative. Also, the propagating mode is left-handed
only if µeﬀ < 0, ǫeﬀ < 0, necessitating that the dielectric
constant of the cladding be negative.

Calculating ǫeﬀ and µeﬀ requires the exact mode struc-

ture in the waveguide. The equation for Hy is

The dispersion relation and the corresponding ǫeﬀ and

gap width 2b = c/ωp. The propagating surface mode
in a SDW exhibits left-handedness:
it’s group velocity
vg = ∂ω/∂k < 0 is negative, and so are µeﬀ < 0 and
ǫeﬀ < 0. The cutoﬀ at ω = 0.9ωp is caused by the van-
ishing of the µeﬀ . This is very diﬀerent from the cutoﬀ
at ω = ωp in a homogeneous plasma-like medium which
is caused by the vanishing of ǫeﬀ .

Why is vg < 0 despite vph = ω/k > 0? The total
Poynting ﬂux Px = cEyHz/4π along the dielectric waveg-
uide is the sum of the ﬂuxes inside the cladding and in
the vacuum gap. In the gap, Ey and Hz are in phase, so
Px > 0. Inside the cladding Ey reverses its sign across the
vacuum/cladding interface because ǫc < 0, and the elec-
tric displacement vector Dy = ǫEy is continuous. Hz is
continuous across the interface, resulting in Px < 0 in the
cladding. For a narrow gap, the integrated Poynting ﬂux
is negative, and the mode is left-handed. We emphasize
that not any surface wave is left-handed. Achieving left-
handedness requires that (a) the frequency of the mode
lie within the stopband of the cladding, (b) there are two

interfaces, and (c) the vacuum gap between the interfaces
is small.

The SDW was considered merely to elucidate the emer-
gence of the left-handed surface waves, and to derive the
necessary conditions (a-c) for their existence. The ob-
jective of this Letter is to construct a photonic structure
capable of transmitting inﬁnitely extended (planar) left-
handed waves in all directions. SDW is not inﬁnitely
extended in y
direction, and it only enables wave prop-
−
direction. Thus, the waveguide stack (WS)
agation in x
with periodicity d in y
direction, shown in Fig. 1(b), is
considered next. The elementary cell of a WS is assumed
to have the piecewise constant dielectric permittivity:
ǫ(x) = 1 for
< d/2. Elec-
< b and ǫ(x) = ǫc for b <
tromagnetic waves in a WS are characterized by the two
kyd < π
numbers: phase shift per unit cell
and the wavenumber ~kx. Electromagnetic waves in a pe-
riodically layered medium have been intensely studied
since the 70’s [9], but without the emphasis on surface
waves which can exhibit left-handedness.

∂ω/∂kx < 0, ∂ω/∂ky > 0. Therefore, waves propagate
as left-handed along the x-direction, and as right-handed
along the x

rection, an additional set of vertical channels is intro-
duced, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Rectangular regions of the
dielectric are separated from each other by a network of
orthogonal vacuum channels which form a square lattice
with the period d = 4.8c/ωp. The channel widths are
b = d/8, and the dielectric boundaries are rounded with
the radius rb = b. Wave propagation along the resulting

ized by two phase shifts per cell, φx

Two classes of electromagnetic modes were found for
any given wavenumber ~k. The higher-frequency mode
is right-handed, and the lower-frequency mode is left-
handed. The physical diﬀerence between these modes is
illustrated by Fig. 3, where the local Poynting ﬂuxes are
shown for kx = d−1π/4, ky = 0. The Poynting ﬂux of the
left-handed mode (ω = 0.85ωp) shown in Fig. 3(a) is lo-
calized near the vacuum/cladding interfaces, and points
in the negative direction. The mode clearly propagates
as a surface wave. In contrast, the right-handed mode
(ω = 0.95ωp) propagates by tunneling across the dielec-
tric cladding, which is why the Poynting ﬂux is posi-
tive and not localized, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The angle
α = 6 (~k, ~Pav) is plotted in Fig. 4 as the function of the
propagation angle θ for the lower-frequency mode of the
SLPW. In an isotropic LHM α = π for any θ. In general,
the medium need not be isotropic, in which case we re-

quire that π/2 < α < 3π/2 for all propagation directions
in order for the medium to be left-handed.

SLPW is an example of such an anisotropic medium:
it is strictly left-handed (because π/2 < α < 3π/2 for all
propagation directions. Group and phase velocities line
up when ~k
~ex, ~ey, (~ex + ~ey). Due to the anisotropy of
the SLPW, radiation ”prefers” to propagate along one of
the channels. Speciﬁcally, if kx > ky, then radiation pref-
direction, and vice versa. Sym-
erentially ﬂows along x

is a rapid transition near θ = π/4 from the preferential
ﬂow along ~ex for θ < π/4 to the preferential ﬂow along ~ey
for θ > π/4. The rapidity of the transition is determined
by the corner curvature of the structure. Note that the
anisotropy of the SLPW is not related to the periodic-
ity of the structure because it is manifest even for small

Photonic waveguide can be made much more isotropic
if dielectrics are arranged in a triangular lattice, as
shown in Fig. 1(d), forming a Triangular Lattice Photonic
Waveguide (TLPW). This arrangement has a higher de-
gree of symmetry than SLPW, and results in a com-
posite medium which is perfectly isotropic for small ~k
which fall well inside the Brillouin zone. The elementary
cell of the TLPW and the dispersion relation ω v. s. ~k
for two orthogonal directions of ~k = ~ex,yk are shown in
Fig. 5. The two dispersion curves, which are identical for
~k
π/d (establishing the isotropy), are drawn to the
|
respective edges of the Brillouin zone: 0 < kxd < 2π/3
and 0 < kyd < 2π/√3 [11].

| ≪

These two directions are chosen because they exhibit
the maximum possible anisotropy. Indeed, for ~k = k~ex
there exists a vacuum/cladding interface along which
the electromagnetic energy can ﬂow in x
direction,
Fig. 6(b). No such interface exists for ~k = k~ey, Fig. 6(a).
Thus, the local Poynting ﬂux patterns are very diﬀerent
for these two directions, as can be seen by comparing
Figs. 6(a,b). For the parameters of Fig. (6), k = d−1π/6,

the index of refraction is n =
refraction can be readily tuned in both directions by ad-
justing the parameters of the TLPW: periodicity d and

Despite the diﬀerences in the ﬂow patters, the cell-
integrated ﬂuxes ~Pav are identical for all directions of ~k,
and so are the frequencies: ω = 0.86ωp. Numerical re-
sults unambiguously conﬁrm that, for small

and group velocities exactly oppose each other. At least
for this particular LHM, the claim of Valanju et. al.

that α = 6 (~vph, ~vg)

large
is merely the consequence of the periodicity of
the photonic structure.

In conclusion, a new photonic structure consisting of

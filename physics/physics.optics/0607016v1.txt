The Sagnac eﬀect in two dimensional (2D) resonant microcavities is studied theoretically and
numerically. The frequency shift due to the Sagnac eﬀect occurs as a threshold phenomenon for the
angular velocity in a rotating microcavity. Above the threshold, the eigenfunctions of a rotating
microcavity become rotating waves while they are standing waves below the threshold.

PACS numbers: 03.65.Pm, 41.20.-q, 42.55.Sa

The Sagnac eﬀect is the phase diﬀerence between two
counter-propagating laser beams in the same ring res-
onator due to rotation, originally introduced by Sagnac
in 1913[1]. It has become the basis for the operation of
the optical gyroscopes such as ring laser gyroscopes and
ﬁber optic gyroscopes after the invention of lasers and op-
tical ﬁbers in 1970’s [2, 3, 4, 5] because the phase and fre-
quency diﬀerence between clockwise (CW) and counter-
clockwise (CCW) propagating beams are proportional to
the applied angular velocity. These optical gyroscopes
are normally used in airplanes, rockets, and ships etc.
since they are the most precise rotation velocity sensors
among any other types of gyroscopes.

The Sagnac eﬀect had been theoretically derived for
the slender waveguides like optical ﬁbers or the ring cav-
ities composed of more than three mirrors by assum-
ing that the light propagates one-dimensionally and the
wavelength of the light is much shorter than the sizes
of the waveguides or the ring cavities[1, 2, 6]. However,
the sizes of the resonant cavities can be reduced to the
order of the wavelength by modern semiconductor tech-
nologies [7, 8, 9]. The conventional description of the
Sagnac eﬀect is not applicable to such small resonant
microcavities. Especially, the resonance wave functions
are standing waves which can never be represented by
the superposition of counter-propagating waves. The as-
sumption of the existence of CW and CCW waves plays
the most important role for the conventional theory of
the Sagnac eﬀect.

In this Letter, by perturbation theory typically used in
quantum mechanics, we show that the Sagnac eﬀect can
also be observed even in resonant microcavities if the an-
gular velocity of the cavity is larger than a certain thresh-
old where the standing wave resonance function changes
into the rotating wave. It is also shown that numerical
results of the quadrupole cavity correspond very well to
the theoretical prediction. Theoretical and numerical ap-
proaches shown in this Letter do not assume that the CW
and CCW waves exist in the cavity, but the pair of the
counter-propagating waves is automatically produced by
mixing the nearly degenerate resonance wave functions
due to rotation of the cavity.

According to the general theory of relativity, the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds in a rotating resonant microcavity are

subject to the Maxwell equations generalized to a non-
inertial frame of reference in uniform rotation with angu-
lar velocity vector Ω[1, 2, 6, 10]. By neglecting O(h2), we
obtain the following wave equation for the electric ﬁeld

tively the velocity of light and the refractive index inside
the cavity.

In conventional theoretical approach for the Sagnac ef-
fect, the frequency shift of the resonance proportional to
the angular velocity of the rotating ring cavity is de-
rived from assuming that the electric ﬁeld in Eq. (1)
propagates one-dimensionally along the slender optical
waveguides[2, 6]. This method is not applicable to the
resonant microcavities because the wavelength of the res-
onance is not much shorter than the size of the cavity and
the electric ﬁeld does not propagate one-dimensionally.

Instead, in the case of the 2D resonant microcavity per-
pendicular to angular velocity vector Ω, the resonances
can be obtained by solving the following stationary wave
equation derived from Eq. (1) for the stable oscillation
solution,

ψ − 2ik (h · ∇) ψ = 0,

(2)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

where the 2D resonant cavity is rotating on xy-plane
clockwisely,i.e., Ω = (0, 0, Ω) and Ω > 0. We as-
sumed that TM mode of the electric ﬁeld oscillates as
E(r, t) = (0, 0, ψ(r)e−ickt + c.c.).

For simplicity, we impose the Dirichlet boundary con-
dition on the electric ﬁeld of the resonant microcavity in
the remainder of this Letter.

In the case of a microdisk cavity, Eq. (2) can be solved
exactly as follows. Eq. (2) is rewritten in the following
form in the cylindrical coordinates,

Eq. (4) is the Bessel diﬀerential equation, and so the solu-
tion f (r) should be the Bessel function of the mth order
Jm(Kmr). The eigenvalue of the wave number k is given
by the zero of Jm(KmR) because of the Dirichlet bound-
ary condition, where R is the radius of the microdisk
cavity.

Accordingly, the shifted wave number due to rotation

where k0 is the zero of the Bessel function Jm(nkR), that
is, the eigenvalue of the wave number when the cavity
is not rotating. Consequently, when the microdisk cav-
ity is rotating, the wave function is the rotating wave
Jm(Kmr)eimθ and the degenerate wave number k0 with-
out rotation splits into two diﬀerent wave numbers of the
counter-propagating waves corresponding to the signs of
the integer m. From Eq. (6), one obtains the frequency
diﬀerence ∆ω between the counter-propagating waves,

∆ω = 2

It is important that the CW and CCW wave solutions
are degenerate eigenstates even when the microdisk cav-
ity is not rotating, and hence the standing wave solution
produced by the superposition of these degenerate rotat-
ing waves are also the eigenfunction. However, with a
ﬁnite angular velocity Ω, the CW and CCW wave solu-
tions become non-degenerate states, which means that
only the rotating waves are the eigenfunction of the ro-
tating microdisk cavity. The frequency diﬀerence ∆ω
between the CW and CCW solutions is proportional to
the angular velocity Ω. This is the Sagnac eﬀect for mi-
crodisk cavities.

In general cases of 2D resonant microcavities of arbi-
trary shapes, Eq. (2) cannot be directly solved in the
same way for microdisks.

First, we discuss the case that the spacing ∆k between
the adjacent eigenvalues k of the wave number is large
enough to satisfy the following inequality,

to the rotation of the cavity, the eigenvalue is shifted
as k = k0 + δk and the wave function is changed as

ψ = ψ0 +
δk and cl are assumed to be so small as Ω/c. Then, from
Eq. (2) we obtain

Consequently, as long as the angular velocity is small,
there is no Sagnac eﬀect, which means
the
wave functions are standing waves instead of counter-
propagating waves and the frequency diﬀerence between
two standing waves does not increase.

Next we discuss the case that the spacing ∆k between
two wave numbers k0 and k1 is so small that it does
not satisfy the inequality (8). According to the pertur-
bation theory for nearly-degenerate states in quantum
mechanics, the wave function should be represented as
the superposition of two nearly-degenerate eigenfuncions:
ψ = c0ψ0 + c1ψ1. Substituting this equation into Eq. (2)
yields

In order to obtain non-trivial solutions for Eq. (12), the

Accordingly, the frequency diﬀerence ∆ω between the

Then, from Eq. (12) we also obtain the ratio of the coef-
ﬁcients c0 and c1 as follows:

c1 = ∓ic0.

(15)

It is important that the standing wave function ψ0
without rotation of the cavity can be represented by
functions as ψ0 =
the superposition of the Bessel
∞
m=0 amJm(nk0r) cos mθ , if the cavity is symmetric
for x-axis and ψ0 is an even function. The other wave
P
function ψ1 nearly degenerate to ψ0 which should be
an odd function for x-axis also can be written as ψ1 =
∞
m=0 bmJm(nk1r) sin mθ , where am ∼ bm and k0 ∼ k1.
When the cavity is rotating but the angular velocity is
P
small enough to satisfy the inequality (8), the frequency
diﬀerence does not increase and the wave functions do
not change drastically. However, when the angular ve-
locity is increased to be larger than this threshold which
violates the inequality (8), the wave functions change into
the CW and CCW rotating waves because of Eq. (15),

ψ =

amJm(nkr) (cos mθ ∓ i sin mθ)

=

amJm(nkr)e∓imθ,

where the wave number k is given by Eq. (13). Then,
according to Eq. (14), one can observe the Sagnac ef-
fect as the frequency diﬀerence ∆ω between counter-
propagating waves proportional to the angular velocity.
The most important point is that there is a threshold
of the angular velocity for the Sagnac eﬀect in resonant
microcavities. It is possible to delete this threshold by
symmetric shapes of the cavities as shown in the case of
microdisks.

Next we numerically solve the Maxwell equation for a
rotating microcavity, and show that the threshold phe-
nomena of the transition from the standing wave solu-
tions to the counter-propagating wave ones actually oc-
cur.

First, let us explain the numerical method brieﬂy. The
solutions ψ(r, θ) for the Maxwell Equation (3) for the
stationary solutions of the rotating cavity can be repre-
sented by the superposition of the Bessel functions in the
cylindrical coordinates,

ψ(r, θ) =

amJm(Kmr)eimθ.

Then the Dirichlet boundary condition is imposed as
ψ(R(θ), θ) = 0, where R(θ) denotes the edge of the cav-
ity. Accordingly, we obtain

For numerical computation, the inﬁnite sum over m can

B, respectively.

M is a large integer. Then Eq. (18) can be rewritten as

For numerical calculation, we choose a quadrupole cav-
ity, which is deﬁned by the boundary R(θ) = R0(1 +
ǫ cos 2θ)[9]. The parameters of the quadrupole are set
as follows: R0 = 6.2866µm, ǫ = 0.12, and the refractive
index n = 1. When the quadrupole cavity is not rotat-
ing, solving the Helmholtz equation Eq. (3) with Ω = 0
yields the nearly-degenerate standing wave eigenfuctions
as shown in Fig. 1. We call the two modes shown in
Fig. 1(a) and (b) modes A and B, respectively.

When the angular velocity Ω is smaller than a certain
threshold Ωth (where R0Ωth/c = 5.0 × 10−8), the fre-
quency diﬀerence does not increase as shown in Fig. 2(a),
and the eigenfunctions remain standing waves. However,
for Ω > Ωth, the frequency diﬀerence increases gradu-
ally, and becomes proportional to Ω, and modes A and
B drastically change into the rotating wave functions as
shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively.

The transition from the standing wave to the rotating
wave can be clearly observed also by the CW and CCW
wave components ξCW,CCW deﬁned as follows based on
rotating wave decomposition of Eq. (17):

ξCW (CCW ) ≡

|am|2/ξ,

around 0.5 for modes A and B as shown in Fig. 2(b) and
(c). When Ω exceeds Ωth, ξCCW (CW ) of mode A(B) sud-
denly vanishes, which means the wave function consists
of only CW(CCW) waves. Therefore, one can see that

P

lar velocity is larger than a certain threshold where the
nearly degenerate standing wave eigenfunctions of the
non-rotating cavity change into the pair of the counter-
propagating waves.

The threshold phenomenon seems to be akin to the
lock-in phenomenon, which occurs owing to the mode-
locking between the counter-propagating waves[2, 3, 6].
However,
in our theoretical approach, the eﬀects of
backscattering and an active medium which both cause
the lock-in phenomenon are not taken into account. The
existence of the threshold can be shown even without
these eﬀects.

The Sagnac eﬀect in microcavities will be actually ob-
servable by measuring the frequency diﬀerence in a ro-
tating frame of reference, as the measuring method of
optical gyroscopes [2, 3]. A discussion on the actual ex-
periment will be reported elsewhere.

We analyze phase matching with reference to frequency doubling in nanosized quadratic waveguides
encompassing form birefringence and supporting cross-polarized fundamental and second harmonic modes. In
an AlGaAs rod with an air-void, we show that phase-matched second-harmonic generation could be achieved
in a wide spectral range employing state-of-the-art nanotechnology.

Since the pioneering work by Franken et al.,1 frequency
doubling has been among the most studied nonlinear
processes in optics. Conversion eﬃciency in second har-
monic generation (SHG) relates to spatio-temporal over-
lap of waves at fundamental (FF) and second harmonic
(SH) frequencies, as well as to their group and phase ve-
locity matching. For the latter, in order to compensate
material and waveguide dispersion, several approaches
have been proposed and demonstrated,2 including bire-
fringent phase-matching (PM), non-critical PM, quasi-
PM (QPM)3 in co- or counter-propagating geometries,
including vertical QPM for surface-emitted SHG.4–7
More recently, novel PM schemes for SHG include ran-
dom quasi-PM,8 photonic crystals and microcavities,9, 10
as well as form-birefringence in waveguides.11–14 Form-
birefringence conjugates the large intensities and inter-
action distances of guided-waves with the possibility of
tailoring the dispersion of cross-polarized waves even in
isotropic crystals such as GaAs and its composites.12–14
It consists in alternating layers with diﬀerent refractive
indices orthogonally to the direction of propagation, such
that the harmonics experience distinct eigen-values for
TE (quasi-TE) and TM (quasi-TM) polarizations. As in
photonic crystals, the degree of birefringence, its disper-
sion and the achievable PM line-width are directly linked
to the index contrast between alternating ﬁlms and their
thicknesses,15 making ﬁlm growth a formidable task.14
For these reasons, a nano-sized structure encompassing
form-birefringence but realizable with just one nonlinear
material should provide signiﬁcant advantages and ver-
satility over standard approaches for parametric mixing
and frequency generation.

In this Letter we propose and investigate SHG in a
suspended rod-waveguide with a nanometric void, imple-

menting form-birefringence and large modal overlap for
eﬃcient upconversion. To achieve the highest index con-
trast between a quadratically nonlinear semiconductor
(AlGaAs) and air (or vacuum), we consider the basic ge-
ometry sketched in Fig. 1, with the electric ﬁeld of the FF
mode parallel to the void (i.e., quasi-TM with respect to
the top surface) and a cross-polarized (i.e., quasi-TE) SH
tightly conﬁned in the air-gap owing to the discontinuity
in the electric ﬁeld normal to the interfaces, the latter
separated by v. Fig. 1 also displays the calculated FF and
SH lowest-order eigen-proﬁles of such a slot waveguide,
similar to the one recently studied by Xu et al. for ring-
resonators in SiO2.16 We consider cubic Al0.3Ga0.7As
with indices nF F and nSH at FF and SH, respectively,
after Ref. [17]. The insertion of a symmetrically-placed
air-gap of width v allows to phase-match the quadratic
interaction between a quasi-T M00 mode of wavelength
λF F and its quasi-T E00 second harmonic, leaving nearly
unaltered the eﬀective second-order susceptibility.

To explore PM in the structure, we ﬁxed the slot-
waveguide height (h = 400nm, see Fig. 1) as to allow
single-mode conﬁnement at FF and form-birefringence
PM for SHG over the explored spectrum. Variations in
h modify the pertinent propagation constants and the
PM wavelengths, but only marginally aﬀect the modal
overlap integrals and the conversion.

We calculated the eﬀective indices versus slot aper-
ture v and individual rod-width w resorting to a ﬁnite-
diﬀerence semi-vectorial mode-solver. This was validated
against a (computationally heavy) fully-vectorial solver
and yielded accurate results for the nanometric geom-
etry under investigation. We also exploited symmetry
and solved the eigenvalue problem for a quarter of the
(transverse) geometry.

lines) vs void v for λF F = 1550nm and three values of
w. Crossings of paired curves correspond to type I PM
for SHG.

Fig. 1. Sketch of the air-void waveguide and correspond-
ing lowest-order 3D eigen-proﬁles. Top: quasi-TM FF;
bottom: quasi-TE SH. Here h = 400nm, w = 150nm,
v = 50nm and λ = 1550nm at FF.

Fig. 2 shows the computed eﬀective indices βλ/2π
for FF (thick lines) and SH (thin lines) versus v and
for three widths w at λF F = 1550nm. The curves at
λSH = λF F /2 exhibit a much stronger dispersion due to
the ﬁlling-factor of the eigensolution in the gap: the SH
mode is much more aﬀected by small changes in v than
the FF, the latter exhibiting a nearly linear dispersion.
Clearly, this becomes more appreciable as v approaches
zero, whereas dispersion ﬂattens for large v.

Fig. 3(top) graphs a set of pairs (v, w) for which

matching. For each pair we computed the modal over-
lap integral and the quadratic susceptibility Γ =
RRS d(x, y)(Ey,F F )2Ex,SH dxdy, with S the cross section
and the ﬁelds normalized as to yield the modal power
P = RR |E(x, y)|2dxdy. d(x, y) is the spatial distribution
of the susceptibility coupling a ˆy-polarized FF to an ˆx-
polarized SH through the element d14. In our waveguide,
d(x, y) = d14 within the w × h rods - cut on a (001) sub-
strate after a 45 rotation with respect to crystal axes14
- and d(x, y) = 0 elsewhere. As an increase in w forces
the mode to ﬁll more the nonlinear dielectric, but the
higher w the higher is the required v to achieve PM,
Γ exhibits a maximum. The corresponding parameters
yield the highest conversion eﬃciency per given propa-
gation length.

The dependence of SHG eﬃciency on λF F is graphed
in Fig. 4 along with the phase mismatch for a slot waveg-

Suspended membranes of lengths and aspect-ratios com-
parable to the one proposed here have been recently re-
alized.18, 19 The top panel shows conversion η and ∆βL
versus λF F for the optimum parameters encircled in Fig.
3 and unity (1W ) excitation, corresponding to a (mate-
rial) power density of ≈ 400M W/cm2 and comparable
to what previously employed for SHG in GaAs/AlGaAs
guides.13 Clearly, a large SHG is associated with the peak
of a sinc-like curve and a speciﬁc PM condition (horizon-
tal dashes) near λF F = 1.55µm. Such an individual zero
for ∆β, however, is not the norm. As displayed in the
bottom of Fig. 3, a slight detuning from the optimum
v shifts and splits the PM-wavelength, giving rise to a
double SH resonance with a mismatch remaining moder-

ate between the two zeroes. This stems from the strong
birefringence of the structure, yielding diﬀerent disper-
sion for the two cross-polarized harmonics. For a given
void, while TM-like modes substantially undergo mate-
rial dispersion, TE SH is quite sensitive to wavelength
changes, resulting in a multi-peaked SHG conversion eﬃ-
ciency amenable to engineering towards broad-band dou-
blers.

3. Bottom: v was reduced by ∼ 5% with respect to the
top panel. Crossings between the horizontal line and the
detuning curve correspond to PM.

In conclusion, we have proposed and numerically in-
vestigated a simple structure for easily tunable and
broad-band SHG. The scheme, suitable of straightfor-
ward extension to other parametric interactions, permits
phase matching even in isotropic crystals, while preserv-
ing the nonlinear material response and a large overlap
integral. The waveguide with a nano-void, well realiz-
able with current technologies, allows extra tuning by,
e.g., the inﬁltration of thermo- or electro-optic dielectrics
or the use of microtransducers for real-time adjustment
of the air-gap as well as direct modulation of the ﬁelds
through the introduction of controlled mismatch (i.e.,
via cascading20). We anticipate a whole new family of
ultra-compact doublers and mixers.

Abstract

The dynamics of Fabry-Perot cavity with suspended mirrors is described. The suspended
mirrors are nonlinear oscillators interacting with each other through the laser circulating in the
cavity. The degrees of freedom decouple in normal coordinates, which are the position of the
center of mass and the length of the cavity. We introduce two parameters and study how the
dynamics changes with respect to these parameters. The ﬁrst parameter speciﬁes how strong
the radiation pressure is.
It determines whether the cavity is multistable or not. The second
parameter is the control parameter, which determines location of the cavity equilibrium states.
The equilibrium state shows hysteresis if the control parameter varies within a wide range. We
analyze stability of the equilibrium states and identify the instability region. The instability is
explained in terms of the effective potential: the stable states correspond to local minima of the
effective potential and unstable states correspond to local maxima. The minima of the effective
potential deﬁnes the resonant frequencies for the oscillations of the cavity length. We ﬁnd the
frequencies, and analyze how to tune them. Multistability of the cavity with a feedback control
system is analyzed in terms of the servo potential. The results obtained in this paper are general
and apply to all Fabry-Perot cavities with suspended mirrors.

1 Introduction

Very long Fabry-Perot cavities serve as measuring devices for interferometric gravitational wave de-
tectors. Several such detectors are currently under construction [1, 2, 3]. The cavities are planned
to have high circulating power and large storage time. For example, LIGO (Laser Interferometer
Gravitational wave Observatory) Fabry-Perot cavities will accumulate 10 kW of power and will have
roughly 1 ms of storage time.

The suspended mirrors are designed to move freely along the direction of the beam propagation.
Due to multi-beam interference in the Fabry-Perot cavity the motion of the mirrors strongly affects
the light inside the cavity. The light, in turn, affects the motion of the mirrors by exerting radiation
pressure on them. The interaction of light in the cavity with the suspended mirrors through radiation
pressure gives rise to a nonlinear dynamics. Finite time of light propagation in the cavity introduces
a time delay in the dynamics. The propagation time gives rise to storage time. Thus a Fabry-Perot
cavity is a dynamical system with delay; such systems are known to have instabilities [4].

The signiﬁcance of the “spring” action and the “damping” effect of the radiation pressure for the
dynamics of the Fabry-Perot cavity was pointed out by Braginskii [5]. The cavity with one suspended
mirror driven by radiation pressure was studied experimentally by Dorsel et al [6, 7, 8, 9]. The
main results reported in these papers are observations of optical bistability and mirror oscillations
with frequencies determined by the radiation pressure. These authors analyzed their results using
the adiabatic approximation for the intra-cavity ﬁeld. At about the same time Deruelle and Tourrenc
studied the Fabry-Perot cavity with suspended mirrors theoretically [10, 11]. Their analysis revealed
delay-induced instability caused by the radiation pressure in the cavity. This instability was further
studied by other researchers [12, 13]. Stabilization of the Fabry-Perot cavity by a control system
was discussed by Meers and MacDonald [14]. Recently, the radiation pressure induced dynamics
of Fabry-Perot cavities attracted attention of the VIRGO group in connection with the design of the
length control system of their detector [15]. Similar research has been done in LIGO and is presented
in this paper.

Emerging laser gravitational wave detectors require detailed modeling and pose new questions for
the study of dynamics. From a phenomenological point of view, there is a question of what are the
parameters that deﬁne the universal properties of Fabry-Perot cavities with suspended mirrors, and
how the dynamics changes with respect to these parameters. From a point of view of applications,
there is a question of how to generalize the results obtained in table-top experiments to large scale
Fabry-Perot cavities of the gravitational wave detectors.

In this paper we attempt to provide a phenomenology of the Fabry-Perot cavities for modeling
and optimization of the performance of LIGO interferometers. Due to the complexity of the subject
we split the discussion into two papers. In the ﬁrst paper we study various aspects of the nonlinearity
in the dynamics, leaving aside the time delay instabilities. In the second paper [16] we consider the
time delay instabilities and study the dynamics of a Fabry-Perot cavity with a realistic control system.
In this paper we formulate the dynamics in terms of normal coordinates: the cavity length and the
cavity center of mass. We show that a small part of the radiation pressure in the cavity, the excess
force, excites the cavity center of mass. In absence of the excess radiation pressure, the dynamics
of the cavity length is equivalent to the dynamics of a suspended mirror in a cavity, which has one
mirror suspended and one mirror ﬁxed. To study the universal properties of the cavity dynamics,

3

such as multistability, we introduce two parameters. The ﬁrst parameter is a control parameter which
allows us to select the equilibrium state. The second parameter characterizes strength of the radiation
pressure and determines whether the system is stable or multistable and how many equilibrium states
are there. The results obtained in this paper are general and apply to any Fabry-Perot cavity with
suspended mirrors. Numerical calculations and modeling with parameters of LIGO cavities are given
throughout this paper.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the equations of motion and deﬁne
the control parameter. In Section 3 we formulate the dynamics in normal coordinates. In Section 4 we
construct equilibrium states and introduce the speciﬁc radiation pressure. In Section 5 hysteresis and
instabilities are described. In Section 6 the global properties of the dynamics are analyzed in terms of
the effective potential. In Section 7 we provide explicit formulas and numerical values for the cavity
resonant frequencies. In Section 8 we brieﬂy describe nonlinear dynamics of the cavity with a control
system.

2 Dynamical Equations and Regimes

2.1 Mirror Coordinates

The dynamical system we study in this paper is a Fabry-Perot cavity with two suspended mirrors,
labeled by a and b, and a laser incident on the cavity from one side. A suspended mirror is a rigid
body with six degrees of freedom, whose dynamics depends on the suspension design. In this paper
we neglect angular degrees of freedom of the mirrors and consider only the motion of their center of
mass. We also neglect the side motion of the mirrors. In this approximation the mirrors are always
aligned to the incident beam and move parallel to themselves as simple pendula. We specify the
mirror positions by their coordinates, xa(t) and xb(t), in the inertial coordinate frames as shown on
ﬁgure 1. The mirror suspension points are also moving, their coordinates are x′

a(t) and x′

b(t).

The two inertial coordinate frames are separated by a large distance, the nominal cavity length,
L0, which we consider ﬁxed. The actual length of the cavity depends on mirror positions in their
respective coordinate frames:

The large cavity length of the gravitational wave detectors makes the delay time,

to be non-negligible. For example, in LIGO interferometers the cavities are 4km long and the corre-

2.2 Equations for Field Dynamics

Multibeam interference of laser in long Fabry-Perot cavities of gravitational wave detectors is far
more complex than a similar process in short Fabry-Perot interferometers with ﬁxed length which are
commonly used for laser spectroscopy. Both the motion of suspended mirrors and the delay times
affect the interference and give rise to a complex dynamics. We describe dynamics of the laser in the
cavity in terms of complex amplitudes of the electric ﬁeld. These complex amplitudes correspond to
the traveling electro-magnetic waves and are deﬁned at some locations. Usually the amplitudes are
deﬁned at the mirror surfaces. However, the suspended mirrors are moving and such a choice would
require account for Doppler effects. Instead, we deﬁne the amplitudes at the reference planes which
are ﬁxed in the inertial coordinate frames.

Our notations for the amplitudes of the electro-magnetic waves are shown in Fig. 2. The amplitude
of the wave, incident on the front mirror, is Ein. The amplitudes of the forward-propagating wave
inside the cavity, deﬁned at the two reference planes, are E1 and E′
1. Similarly, the amplitudes of the
backward-propagating wave are E2 and E′
2. The amplitudes of the cavity transmitted and reﬂected
waves are E3 and E4.

Propagation of the laser inside the cavity is described by the delay equations:

These and other equations for the complex amplitudes are derived in the Appendix B. The equations
for reﬂection and transmission of the laser at the end mirror are:

where ra and ta is the reﬂectivity and the transmissivity of the front mirror. Numerical values for the
reﬂectivities and the trasmissivities of the mirrors in LIGO cavities are given in the Appendix A.

The equations (3-8) describe dynamics of the laser interacting with the moving mirrors of the
cavity. These equations can be reduced to one equation with one ﬁeld, which is called the self-
consistent ﬁeld. All other ﬁelds can be expressed in terms of the self-consistent ﬁeld through the ﬁeld
equations above.

We choose the forward-propagating ﬁeld to be the self-consistent ﬁeld. Let the amplitude of the
self-consistent ﬁeld be E(t) (same as E1(t)). Then the equation for dynamics of the self-consistent
ﬁeld is

where z(t) is the relative mirror position deﬁned as

E(t) = taEin + rarbe−2ikz(t)E(t

The quantity, L0 + z(t), is the distance between the mirrors in relativistic sense.

Since the speed of light is ﬁnite we cannot obtain information about the instantaneous cavity
length deﬁned in eq. (1). However, we can measure the relativistic cavity length, z(t), by observation
of one of the cavity ﬁelds. This can be done using the Pound-Drever signal extraction scheme. The
Pound-Drever signal is based on observation of the cavity reﬂected laser

which is deﬁned in terms of the self-consistent ﬁeld and, therefore, depends on the cavity length, z(t).
In the expression, eq. (10), the delay appears in the coordinate of the end and not the front mirror.
This is because upon entering the cavity the laser ﬁrst reﬂects off the end mirror and then reﬂects off
the front mirror.

2.3 Forces Acting on Mirrors

Dynamics of the suspended mirrors is deﬁned by the forces acting on them. Since we analyze only
longitudinal motion of the mirrors we consider only horizontal components of the forces. The hori-
zontal component of the wire tension, acting on the front mirror, is

0(xa −
where ma is the mass of the front mirror and ω0 is the pendulum frequency. There is a similar
expression for the end mirror.

Many control schemes, including the control system of LIGO arm cavities, require actuators on
the mirrors. The actuators can be coil-magnet pairs, electro-static boards or other devices. For our
analysis the details of the actuators are not important. We only assume that actuators are perfectly
aligned and apply forces to the mirrors in the direction of the beam propagation. Let the actuator
forces be F act

and F act

.

a

b

There is also a friction force due to energy losses in the suspension wires and the actuators. We
assume that the friction is proportional to velocity. Then the friction force acting on the front mirror
can be written as

where γ is the damping coefﬁcient. A similar expression can be obtained for the end mirror. Typically
10−5.
the damping coefﬁcient is very small: γ/ω0 ∼

Numerical values for the parameters of LIGO interferometers are given in Appendix A.

2.4 Control Parameter

Let us consider the sum of the pendulum restoring force and the actuator force for the front mirror:

There are two parameters here: the position of the suspension point and the actuator force. The mirror
can be controlled through both the actuator and the suspension point. However, the dynamics depends
only on the sum of the two parameters, and not separately on each one. Therefore, we combine the
two parameters into a new parameter

This is the control parameter for the front mirror. A similar parameter, ub, can be introduced for the
end mirror.

The control parameter has dimension of length and the meaning of an equivalent displacement of
0)−1, which for LIGO is

the suspension point. The equivalence is based on the conversion factor (mω2
roughly 4.2 millimeter per newton of the actuator force.

Moving the suspended mirrors at high frequencies is easier using the actuator. However, applying
large displacements to the mirror at low frequencies is better through the suspension point. Therefore
in a realistic control system the control parameter, u, may obtain its high frequency component from
the actuator force and its low frequency component from the position of the suspension point.

These are the equations for a pair of damped harmonic oscillators driven by forces of the radiation
pressure. The oscillators are not independent: they are interacting with each other through the laser
which acts as a spring connecting the mirrors. The “spring” is nonlinear and has time delay.

2.6 Dynamical Regimes

A Fabry-Perot cavity has two intrinsic time scales: one is the delay time, T , the other is the storage
time

Correspondingly, there are two intrinsic frequencies deﬁned by the cavity: the free spectral range
(fFSR = (2T )−1) and the cavity low pass frequency

τ =

2T
ln(rarb)

.

fcav =

1
2πτ

.

(21)

(22)

Therefore, there are three dynamical regimes for the Fabry-Perot cavity.

Let δt be a characteristic time for a dynamic process involving changes in the mirror positions and

ﬁelds. Let f be the characteristic frequencies of the process. The three regimes are:

1. decoupled regime: δt

T (f

fFSR),

2. delay regime: T

≪
3. adiabatic regime: δt

δt

≪

≫
τ (fcav ≪
≪
fcav).
τ (f

f

≫

fFSR),

≪

The ﬁrst regime corresponds to very fast changes in mirror positions and ﬁelds in the Fabry-Perot
cavity. The decoupled regime can be understood on the following example. First the mirrors are at
rest. Then one mirror acquires some velocity, changes its position and stops. If the entire process
takes time less than T the second mirror becomes affected by the process after the ﬁrst mirror comes
to rest. Therefore, during such process the mirrors are independent of each other. This is nothing but
a relativistic causality limit. In LIGO interferometers the processes with frequencies above 37.5 kHz
belong to the decoupled regime.

The second regime takes place when the changes in the mirror position are faster than transient
processes in the cavity but not fast enough to decouple the mirrors. In this regime the transients caused
by the mirror motion never die and the cavity never reaches equilibrium. In such a regime the motion
of one mirror is constantly affected by the other mirror and the delays play crucial role. Dynamic
processses in LIGO cavities with frequencies between 100 Hz and 10 kHz belong to this regime.

The third regime takes place when the mirrors move so slow that the laser transients can be ne-
glected. In this case we can think of the laser circulating in the cavity as being in equilibrium with
the mirrors. This is the adiabatic regime. In this regime the delays are not important. The adiabatic
regime takes place in LIGO cavities at frequencies less than 100 Hz.

2.7 Self-consistent Field in Adiabatic Regime

In the adiabatic regime the mirror motion is so slow that we can neglect the delay time in the equation
for the self-consistent ﬁeld eq. (9) and obtain a solution:

The value of the ﬁeld in the adiabatic regime is completely deﬁned by the current value of the cavity
length, z(t). The power in the cavity, which we deﬁne as the momentum carried by the forward-
2) is also a function of the cavity length. The maximum power, Pmax,
propagating wave (P =
depends on the mirror parameters and deﬁnes the cavity gain:

E

The power as a function of length is described by the Airy formula

3 Normal Coordinates

3.1 Forces due to Radiation Pressure

The suspended mirrors are interacting with each other through the laser in the cavity. Therefore, the
degrees of freedom which correspond to the mirrors are coupled. However, we can formulate the
dynamics in terms of new degrees of freedom which are largely independent of each other. These
new degrees of freedom are similar to the normal coordinates usually appeared in theory of coupled
linear oscillators. Before we formulate the dynamics in terms of the normal coordinates we reduce
the number of ﬁelds entering the general expressions for the radiation pressure on the mirrors, equa-
tions (14-15).

The radiation pressure on the end mirror, eq. (15) can be expressed entirely in terms of the self-

consistent ﬁeld:

The radiation pressure on the front mirror is produced by the laser circulating in the cavity and the
laser incident on the cavity, eq. (14). A constant ﬂux of the incident laser produces constant radiation
pressure on the front mirror:

In this equation the ﬁrst term implies that the same force which is pushing the end mirror now will be
pushing the front mirror in the opposite direction after time T . The second term is proportional to the
power of the incident laser and accounts for the constant radiation pressure from outside the cavity.
The last term, ∆R(t), which can be called the excess radiation pressure, accounts for the asymmetry
between the mirrors and the interference between the incident laser and the laser circulating in the
cavity. The excess force can also be expressed entirely in terms of the self-consistent ﬁeld and the
cavity length:

Numerical estimates with LIGO parameters show that the excess radiation pressure, ∆R, is roughly
four orders of magnitude less than the radiation pressure, Rb.

The constant radiation pressure, eq. (28), has no effect on the dynamics, but the excess force,

eq. (30), makes the radiation pressure on the mirrors unbalanced and affects the dynamics.

3.2 Normal Modes

The normal coordinates are the position of the center of mass and the cavity length:

Z(t) =

z(t) = xb(t

Note that both normal coordinates are affected by the delay due to the ﬁnite time of laser propagation
in the cavity.

To make the subsequent formulas simpler we hid the constant radiation pressure into the new control
parameters. Also we deﬁne the reduced mass in a usual way:

In normal coordinates the dynamical equations are the equation for the center of mass and the

equation for the cavity length:

µ =

(38)

We see that the radiation pressure mostly affects one degree of freedom: the cavity length, z(t). This
is because the pressure on the front mirror is roughly equal and opposite to the pressure on the end
mirror if we neglect the constant pressure from outside. The motion of the center of mass is affected
by the radiation pressure only through the excess force.

3.3 Center of Mass and Observability

Dynamics of the center of mass of free cavity is deﬁned exclusively by the excess radiation pressure,
which, in turn, is deﬁned by the cavity length, z(t). As a result, changes in the cavity length excite
motion of the center of mass. On the contrary, arbitrary motion of center of mass has no effect on the
cavity length. Therefore we can ignore the dynamics of the center of mass and focus on the cavity
length. However, few important points must be taken into account before we abandon the motion of
the center of mass.

Although small motion of the center of mass (

1µm) has no effect on the detector performance,
0.1 mm) will cause variations of the actuator gains. Therefore, the motion of the

large motion (

∼

∼

12

cavity center of mass must be suppressed to the extent deﬁned by the actuator’s range. In particular,
we must avoid exciting the motion of the center of mass by a control system. In gravitational wave
detectors the control system suppresses motion of the mirror under seismic disturbances by applying
forces to the mirrors through the actuators. Therefore the control system can excite the motion of the
center of mass, unless the control signals are synchronized:

δua(t) =

mb
ma

−

δub(t

T ).

−

(39)

Unlike the cavity length the center of mass is not observable in a strict relativistic sense. To
obtain information about the cavity’s center of mass requires setting up an inertial frame, which is
impossible for the ground based gravitational wave detectors. This poses a problem of observability
for control of the Fabry-Perot cavity, which can be stated as follows. The cavity length is known with
high precision (better than 10−13m) but the center of mass can only be measured approximately (up
to 1µm). Therefore the cavity length can only be controlled approximately. Since the two degrees of
freedom are largely independent poor observability and control of the center of mass do not affect the
dynamics of the cavity length. Therefore, as long as the motion of the center of mass remains small,
it can be ignored.

3.4 Cavity Length

The degree of freedom most important for understanding the response of Fabry-Perot cavity as a part
of the gravitational wave detector is the cavity length z(t).

In the following discussion of the cavity length dynamics we neglect the excess radiation pressure,
2 in the eq. 27 and

∆R. To simplify following formulas we make the approximation: 1 + r2
write the radiation pressure on the end mirror as

t2

2.

This is a good approximation for high reﬂective mirrors, such as the end mirrors of LIGO cavities.

The dynamics of the cavity length is independent of the dynamics of the center of mass and can
be studied separately. The equations for the cavity length dynamics include only the cavity length and
the self-consistent ﬁeld:

The iteration equation (42) allows us to calculate the amplitude E(t) at discrete times. The time step
is the cavity round-trip time, 2T . The value of the amplitude between the steps can be found by
delaying its value at the last iteration.

These equations are equivalent to the equations of the dynamics of the Fabry-Perot cavity with
front mirror ﬁxed and the end mirror suspended from wires, provided the mass of the end mirror is
equal to the reduced mass.

The complex ﬁeld, E, can be eliminated from the equations (43) and (44) and the equilibrium condi-
tion can be written entirely in terms of the cavity length:

Here Rmax is the maximum radiation pressure on the end mirror which corresponds to the maximum
power in the cavity:

The equation (45) shows that in equilibrium the radiation pressure is balanced by the pendulum restor-
ing force.

Numerical values of the power and the radiation pressure in LIGO Fabry-Perot cavities are given

4.2 Strength of Radiation Pressure

To characterize strength of the radiation pressure we introduce a dimensionless parameter

(43)

(44)

(45)

(46)

(47)

where k = 2π/λ is the wave number, µ is the reduced mass and ω0 is the pendulum frequency. The
parameter σ shows how strong the radiation pressure is compared to the pendulum restoring force.

σ =

kRmax
µω2
0

,

14

This parameter allows us to characterize nonlinearities induced by the radiation pressure quantita-
tively. As a measure of nonlinearities, the parameter σ is similar to the Reynolds number in ﬂuid
dynamics.

The parameter σ also allows us to establish equivalence of the equilibrium states of different
Fabry-Perot cavities. Namely, the equilibrium states of a Fabry-Perot cavity with high circulating
power and heavy mirrors are equivalent to those of a cavity with low power and light mirrors if the
two cavities have the same σ.

The parameter σ has a simple geometric interpretation. From the equilibrium condition, eq. (45),
we see that the maximum increase in the cavity length due to radiation pressure is σ/k. Therefore,
σ/π is the maximum number of fringes the mirrors can be pushed apart by the radiation pressure.

We can think of σ as a function of the incident power

σ =

2kGcav
cµω2
0

Pin,

where Gcav is the cavity gain, eq. (24). Therefore, the simplest way to change the parameter σ is to
vary the input power of the Fabry-Perot cavity.

4.3 Equilibrium Condition

The equilibrium states depend on properties of Airy function:

A(φ) =

1
1 + F sin2 φ

.

A discussion of Airy function can be found in ref. [17]. Some of the properties of Airy function are
given in the Appendix C.

Let us introduce the phase variables for the cavity length and the control parameter:

In terms of the phase variables the condition for equilibrium, eq. (45), becomes

By solving this equation we can ﬁnd equilibrium states, φ, for any given value of the control param-
eter, η. Even more important is an inverse application of the equilibrium condition. Namely, we can
turn any state, φ, into an equilibrium state by adjusting the control parameter, η, according to

An operation point for the Fabry-Perot cavity is an equilibrium state, at which we want to maintain
the cavity. We select the operation point by specifying the phase, φ0, and by adjusting the control
parameter according to the eq. (53).

φ = kz,
η = ku.

(48)

(49)

(50)

(52)

(53)

In LIGO interferometers the operation point is chosen at the maximum of Airy function (φ0 =
πn), where n is integer. To obtain an equilibrium state at these points we must have the control
parameter set to the following values

u =

λ
2 (cid:18)

n

−

σ
π (cid:19)

.

(54)

Since all the peaks of Airy function are equivalent the different values of the control parameter,
which correspond to different values of n, are all equivalent. The least absolute value of the control
parameter corresponds to n = round(σ/π). Since the control parameter is a linear combination of the
actuator force and the displacement of the suspension point, eq.(18), this condition can be achieved in
two ways. We can either apply the forces to the mirrors or shift the suspension points. The larger the
actuator forces the higher the noise in the actuators. Therefore, it is desirable to operate the cavities
with as less force on the mirrors as possible.

4.4 Graphical Construction of Equilibrium States

The equilibrium states are given by the nonlinear equation, eq. (52), which cannot be solved analyti-
cally. However, we can analyze the equilibrium states using a graphical construction. The graphical
method for ﬁnding the equilibrium states appears in several papers, for example, in ref. [18]. In our
approach we use the graphical method not only to show approximate locations of the equilibrium
states but also to derive exact statements about equilibrium and stability of the Fabry-Perot cavity.

The graphical construction is to plot the functions in the left and the right sides of the equation (52)
and look for their intersections. The left side of the equation is the pendulum restoring force in
dimensionless units. It corresponds to a straight line shown in Fig. 3. The line has the slope σ−1 and
the intercept η. The right side of the equation is the Airy function, which is the radiation pressure
normalized to unity at its maximum. The points, where the straight line intersects the Airy function,
are the equilibrium states. In Figure 3 there are three equilibrium states: φ1, φ2 and φ3.

4.5 Condition for Multistability

A Fabry-Perot cavity is multistable if it has more than one equilibrium state, which belong to the
same value of the control parameter. To derive a condition for multistability consider a line tangential
to the Airy proﬁle at some point, φ0. The slope of the tangent line is A′(φ0), the derivative of Airy
function at this point. The highest slope of the tangent line corresponds to the maximum value of the
derivative

max

} ≈
which is derived in Appendix C. If the slope of the straight line, which represents the pendulum
restoring force, is greater than the maximum slope, the line intersects the Airy proﬁle at only one
point. Otherwise, the straight line and Airy proﬁle can have several common points. Therefore, there
is a critical value of the parameter σ, for which a qualitative change in the equilibrium states occurs.
This critical value is deﬁned by the maximum slope

and depends only on the ﬁnesse of the Fabry-Perot cavity. These geometric arguments lead us to the
condition for multistability. The Fabry-Perot cavity is

stable, if
σ < σcr
multistable, if σ > σcr.

LIGO Fabry-Perot cavities are multistable: σ = 3.9, which is greater than the critical value,

σcr = 0.012.

4.6 Higher order bifurcations

At low radiation pressure (σ < σcr) the cavity has only one equilibrium state. If we increase the
radiation pressure and reach the critical point (σ = σcr) the equilibrium state splits into three states,
as shown in Fig. 4. Two of the new states are stable and one is unstable. Such a phenomenon is
common in nonlinear physics and is called the pitchfork bifurcation [19], [20].

If we keep increasing the radiation pressure, at some point another bifurcation occurs and more
equilibrium states are created. We can continue the process and obtain an inﬁnite number of bifur-
cations in the Fabry-Perot cavity. The values of the parameter σ, at which these bifurcations occur,
πn where
can be found from the graphical construction shown in Fig. 5. These values are σn ≈
n = 1, 2, . . . is the order of the bifurcation. In terms of power the condition for the nth order bifurca-
tion to occur is

Pmax =

Exact number of equilibrium states depends not only on the parameter σ, but also on the control

parameter, u.

5 Stability and Hysteresis

5.1 Multistability of Fabry-Perot cavity

Fabry-Perot cavity with suspended mirrors is a multistable dynamical system. There are multiple
equilibrium states in the cavity which correspond to the same value of the control parameter. Some of
them are stable and some are unstable. A multistable cavity being brought near unstable equilibrium
state moves to a nearest stable equilibrium state, which belongs to the same value of the control
parameter.

Multistability of the Fabry-Perot cavity manifests itself in multi-valued functions describing the
cavity state. For example, the equilibrium cavity length, z, is a multi-valued function of the control
parameter, u. This function is deﬁned implicitly:

z = u +

A(kz),

σ
k

(58)

and is shown on Fig. 6.

A similar multistable response appears if we vary the input power, Pin, within a wide range, but
keep the control parameter ﬁxed. This way we obtain the power in the cavity, P , as a multi-valued
function of the input power. Such function also is deﬁned implicitly:

bistable optical devices [21], [22].

Both plots above have retrograde segments which correspond to unstable equilibrium states of the

cavity. In general any state on a retrograde part of a multistable curve is unstable [20].

The formula which describes the power inside the cavity as a function of the input power, eq. (59),
is equivalent to the corresponding formula for the ﬁxed length cavity ﬁlled with a non-linear medium.
The index of refraction of such medium has a quadratic nonlinearity

where n0 and n2 are the coefﬁcients of the nonlinear index of refraction. A review of the extensive
research which had been done on the cavities with the quadratic nonlinearity can be found in [21].
Here we obtain an exact condition for this equivalence. In the equation (59) the phase is a function of
the power:

A similar dependence appears in the cavity with ﬁxed length but ﬁlled with the nonlinear medium.
The equivalence is achieved by tuning the parameters according to the equation:

where l0 is the length of the cavity with the nonlinear medium. Therefore, equilibrium states of a
cavity with suspended mirrors are equivalent to those of a cavity ﬁlled with the nonlinear medium if
the condition, eq. (62) is satisﬁed. This equivalence allows us to extend some results obtained for the
cavities with the medium to the cavity with suspended mirrors.

5.2 Hysteresis of Mirror Position

The instability causes jumps and a hysteresis to appear. In this section we describe the mirror jumps
and the hysteresis in the mirror position in the Fabry-Perot cavity.

Assume that one mirror is at rest and the other is moving. Let this motion be so slow that the cavity
remains in equilibrium. We can produce such motion by a slow change of the control parameter. The
motion of the mirror is shown on the parameter-state diagram, Fig. 8.

Let “A” be a starting point. Assume that we force the mirror to move by changing the control
parameter from uA to uB. As we increase the value of the control parameter the mirror moves steadily
from point “A” through point H1 to point H2. As the mirror reaches point H2 a sudden transition to
point H3 occurs. This jump happens because both points H2 and H3 belong to the same value of the
control parameter but point H2 is unstable. After the mirror reaches point H3, it resumes its steady
motion and reaches the point “B”. The sequence of states is

H3 →
H3 is accompanied by a rapid build-up of power in the cavity, and, therefore, takes

H1 →

H2 →

→

(63)

The jump H2 →
time of the order of the storage time to complete.

In the reverse process, we change the control parameter from uB to uA and thereby force the mirror
to move in the opposite direction. On the way back the mirror does not retract its path. Instead, it
follows a sequence

B

H3 →

H4 →

The reverse motion of the mirror also has a jump but at a different place: point H4. The transition
H1 is accompanied by a rapid drop of power in the cavity. Thus a slow sweep of the mirror

across the resonance is an irreversible process, known as hysteresis. The complete cycle:

H4 →
is the hysteresis loop, which is typical for nonlinear systems.

H3 →

A similar hysteresis appears if we keep the control parameter ﬁxed but vary the input power. Such

hysteresis was observed by Dorsel and collaborators and is described in ref.[6].

5.3 Boundaries of Instability

The states on the retrograde segments of the multistability curve on Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 are unstable.
These states form an instability region which is conﬁned by the two tangent lines with the slope σ−1,
as shown in Fig. 8. The boundaries of the instability region are deﬁned by the equation

There are two solutions of this equation, which are left and right boundaries of the instability region.
In the large-F approximation the instability region is

(65)

(66)

(67)

The left boundary corresponds to low power inside the Fabry-Perot cavity. The right boundary
is located very close to the peak of the Airy function and corresponds to high power. For example,
7.5µrad. Thus the
in the 4km LIGO interferometers the right boundary of the instability is φ0 =
separation between the right boundary and the peak is very small, roughly a thousandth of the width
of Airy function.

6 Hamiltonian Dynamics

6.1 Conditions for Adiabatic Motion

Motion of the mirrors belongs to the adiabatic regime only if it is slow; the characteristic time of
such motion must be much greater than the cavity storage time. We deﬁne the characteristic time
differently for small- and large-amplitude mirror motions.

τ .

We consider the amplitude small if it is less than the width of the resonance. Usually such motion
is oscillatory. Then the characteristic time is equal to the period of these oscillations, Tosc. Therefore,
the motion is adiabatic if Tosc ≫
Large-amplitude mirror motion takes place when the changes in the cavity length are greater
than the width of resonance, xw. During such motion the relative velocity of the mirrors, v, can be
considered constant within the time the mirrors pass through a resonance. Then the characteristic
time is the time it takes for the length to change by the width of one resonance: xw/v. Therefore, the
τ . This condition can also be seen as a requirement on the relative
motion is adiabatic if xw/v

6.2 Effective Potential

In the adiabatic regime the ﬁeld inside the cavity, E(t), is completely deﬁned by the length, z(t), see
eq. (23). Therefore, we can eliminate the ﬁeld and consider only the dynamics of the length. The
equation for the length dynamics becomes

RmaxA(kz),

where µ is the reduced mass and Rmax is the maximum radiation pressure deﬁned by eq. (46). This
equation describes the relative motion of the mirrors driven by the pendulum restoring force and the
radiation pressure. A similar equation for the Fabry-Perot cavity with one suspended mirror appeared
earlier in refs. [6], [10], [11].

The pendulum restoring force is generated by the usual quadratic potential

which depends on the control parameter, u. The force due to the radiation pressure is generated by a

which is derived in the Appendix C.

(69)

(70)

(71)

22

The sum of the two forces is generated by the effective potential

Veﬀ(z) = Vp(z) + Vrad(z).

(72)

Thus the relative motion of the mirrors interacting with the electro-magnetic ﬁeld in the cavity is
equivalent to the motion of a particle with the reduced mass in the ﬁeld of the effective potential.
Such representation is valid only in the adiabatic regime, when the delay time can be neglected.
Beyond the adiabatic regime the delay time becomes important and the ﬁeld depends on history of
mirror’s motion within the storage time.

A remarkable property of the adiabatic regime is that the dynamics is hamiltonian. In other words,

we can deﬁne a total energy for the motion in the effective potential:

Thus the Fabry-Perot cavity in the adiabatic regime is a hamiltonian system. Since there is friction
(γ > 0) the energy is not conserved:

However, the friction in suspension systems of the gravitational wave detectors is very small. Con-
sequently the energy changes very little (less than a part per million) over a period of the pendulum.
Therefore, on time scales of the order of few seconds and even minutes we can think that the energy
is conserved.

Note that if there is no friction (γ = 0) the energy of the motion in the effective potential, eq. (73),
is conserved but the combined energy of the mirrors and the electro-magnetic ﬁelds in the cavity may
not be conserved. The cavity, being multistable, may release or absorb energy as it moves from an
unstable to a stable state.

6.3 Global Properties of Effective Potential

The effective potential as a function of cavity length depends essentially on three parameters: F , σ
and η. This can be seen if we write the effective potential in terms of dimensionless parameters:

(75)

The overall constant provides correct dimensions to the potential, but otherwise is irrelevant. The
parameter σ and the control parameter η can be dynamically adjusted, but the coefﬁcient of ﬁnesse,
F , cannot be. Therefore, we only consider how the effective potential changes with respect to arbitrary
changes in the two parameters: σ and η.

Global properties of the effective potential are deﬁned by one parameter only, σ. For σ < σcr the
potential has only one minimum and for σ > σcr there are several local minima. Effective potential
for two different values of σ is shown in Fig. 9. The plots correspond to stable and multistable Fabry-
Perot cavities.

The effective potential as a function of two parameters establishes a connection between the dy-
namics of the Fabry-Perot cavity in the adiabatic regime and the dynamical systems of the catastrophe

theory [23]. The catastrophe theory studies singularities (abrupt changes) in equilibrium states of a
dynamical system caused by a continuous change of its parameters. The pitchfork bifurcation, as
described above, is one of the examples of such singularities.

6.4 Minima and Maxima of the Effective Potential

The control parameter, η, allows us to ﬁne tune the effective potential. By changing the control
parameter we can shift the positions of local minima and maxima of the potential. To illustrate this
consider the following example. Let the operation point be φ1 as shown in Figure 10.

To make this state an equilibrium we have to adjust the control parameter according the eq. (53).

This is equivalent to solving the following equation:

= 0.

Since at the point, φ1, the effective potential has a local minimum:

dVeﬀ
dφ (cid:12)
φ=φ1

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
d2Veﬀ
dφ2 (cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
this state is stable. From the ﬁgure we see that if we choose the operation point at φ2, we obtain
(cid:12)
the same control parameter and arrive at the same effective potential. However, at the point φ2 the
effective potential has a local maximum:

φ=φ1

Therefore, the equilibrium state at φ2, is unstable.
(cid:12)

< 0.

φ=φ2

Thus, stable equilibrium positions correspond to local minima and unstable equilibrium positions
correspond to local maxima of the effective potential. By adjusting the control parameter we can turn
any state into a stable equilibrium if that state is outside the instability region, eq.(67).

7 Resonance of Cavity Length

7.1 Resonant Frequency

A stable equilibrium state of the cavity corresponds to a local minimum of the effective potential. Let
the minimum of the effective potential be at z0. The small-amplitude mirror motion near this equi-
librium state produces harmonic oscillations of the cavity length. The frequency of such oscillations,
Ω0, is deﬁned by the curvature of the potential at the minimum:

0 = µ−1 d2Veﬀ

(79)

The oscillations of length due to motion of a single mirror, conﬁned in one of the minima of the
effective potential were observed by Dorsel et al [6, 7].

Since there are multiple equilibrium states, there are multiple frequencies for the oscillations of
the cavity length. Each minimum of the effective potential has its own frequency. These are the
resonant frequencies of the cavity length, if the cavity is driven by the external sinusoidal force. At
high radiation pressure these frequencies substantially deviate from the pendulum frequency, ω0. We
ﬁnd that the frequencies can be expressed entirely in terms of the parameter σ and the location of the
minimum:

7.2 Adjustment of Resonance Frequencies

The resonances of cavity length make the Fabry-Perot cavity a narrow-band transducer between me-
chanical and optical signals. This observation was made by Dorsel and collaborators [8]. They also
suggested that a resonant frequency can be tuned by changing the power of the incident laser. The
adjustment of the incident power, which are equivalent to the adjustments of the parameter σ is not
the only way to tune the resonant frequency. We can also vary the control parameter. By changing the
control parameter we can shift the minimum of the effective potential and thus change the resonant
frequency corresponding to that minimum.

On the other hand we may require that the operation point remains ﬁxed as we tune the resonant
frequency. This can be done if we vary the two parameters, σ and η, simultaneously so that the
equilibrium condition is preserved. For this we need to accompany any change δσ by the change in
the control parameter as follows

This way we change the curvature of the effective potential at the minimum without changing the
location of that minimum.

The result is the resonant frequency as a function of the control parameter

A(φ0) δσ.

7.3 Plateaus of the Effective Potential

By tuning the parameters, σ and η, we can make the effective potential more and more ﬂat at one of
its minima and even form a plateau:

d2Veﬀ
dz2 = 0.
One way of creating the plateau is to tune the control parameter, η. In this method we ﬂatten the
potential by bringing the minimum closer to the nearest local maximum. This method of obtaining
the plateau by merging the local minimum with the nearest local maximum has a drawback. Namely,
in this method we bring the operation point closer and closer to the instability region, eq. (67).

(84)

Another way of forming the plateau at the minimum is to start with lower power (σ < σcr) and
gradually increase the power until the bifurcation occurs (σ = σcr). In this method we begin with a
stable cavity: the effective potential has only one minimum. We have to adjust the control parameter
so that the operation point coincides with this minimum:

d3Veﬀ
dz3 = 0.

(85)

By increasing the incident power σ
At the bifurcation point (σ = σcr) the plateau is formed.

7.4 Period of Anharmonic Oscillations

The oscillations of length in almost ﬂat potential are anharmonic and can have very large period. At
the critical point the potential is of fourth order:

where a is the amplitude of the oscillation. Since the amplitude of mirror motion and correspondingly
the amplitude of the length oscillations is very small (of the order of a few µm), the period can be
very large.

In practice it is unlikely that the cavity is maintained exactly at the bifurcation point. More likely
the long period oscillations are obtained slightly below the critical point σ < σcr. In this case the
potential is not quartic, nonetheless the oscillations have long period, which can be found from a

In Table 2 we show numerical values of frequencies of the oscillations in the nearly ﬂat potential
for LIGO Fabry-Perot cavities. The ﬂatness of the potential is characterized by the deviation of the
parameter σ from its critical value. The table shows that we can achieve period substantially greater

8 Implications for Control System

8.1 Pound-Drever Locking Servo

The operation point of the cavity is a stable equilibrium length which corresponds to a minimum of
the effective potential. Due to the ambient seismic motion the actual state of the cavity is constantly
moving near the operation point. Often the minimum of the effective potential is not deep enough to
conﬁne the state. In such case a negative feedback control system (servo) is used to keep the cavity
state within the minimum. The dynamics of the cavity with the control system is described by the
same equations as before but the control parameter, u, becomes a function of the cavity length. In
LIGO interferometers the control function, u(z), is proportional to the Pound-Drever signal, eq. (11):

u(z)

Im
{

∝

E(t)

.

}

Such control function depends on the cavity length z and does not depend on the cavity center of
mass.

There is no explicit analytic expression for the function u(z), given by eq. (89), which is valid for

all dynamical regimes. However, in the adiabatic regime we can obtain a simple formula

u(z) =

G
2k (cid:19)

sin 2kz
1 + F sin2 kz

− (cid:18)

+ u0,

where G is the gain and u0 is the dc-bias of the control system. The minus sign in eq. (90) accounts
for the negative feedback.

If the deviation of the cavity length from the nearest fringe is much less than the width of the

resonance the control signal becomes linear:

where n is the order of the fringe. Since the amplitude of motion of the mirrors is small (of the order

8.2 Multistability in Presence of Servo

Since the control law eq. (90) is a periodic function of the cavity length the cavity with the servo is
multistable. To study multistability in dynamics of the cavity with the control system we introduce
the static servo potential

Therefore, in the adiabatic regime the dynamics of the cavity with the servo can be described by the
combined potential

For large-amplitude mirror motion the control function, u(z), is nonlinear and, therefore, the servo
acts as a nonlinear device. The effect of the servo depends on the gain, G, and can be made stronger
than the effect of the radiation pressure. Fig. 13 shows the sum of the radiation pressure potential and
the servo potential for three different values of the servo gain: G = 102, 103, 104. On the ﬁrst plot

the sum of the two potentials looks like a staircase which is characteristic of the radiation pressure
potential. Here the effect of the servo is negligible compared to the effect of the radiation pressure.
On the second plot the “staircase” shows dips created by the servo. Here the effect of the servo is
comparable to the effect of radiation pressure. On the third plot the dips are bigger than the steps, and
the servo dominates the radiation pressure.

8.3 Equilibrium and DC-bias

Stable equilibrium states of the cavity with the servo are the minima of the combined potential:

This condition can also be seen as a requirement on the dc-bias. Namely, a cavity state, z0, becomes
an equilibrium if the dc-bias is set according to the equation:

From this equation we see that, in general, the dc-bias is connected to the gain of the servo. There-
fore, changes of the servo gain should be accompanied by the corresponding changes of the dc-bias.
Otherwise the equilibrium condition will be lost and the equilibrium state will change. There is one
exception to this rule. In the case when the operation point is chosen at the peak of the Airy function

Note the dependence of the dc-bias on the fringe number, n.

8.4 Stability Provided by Servo

The negative feedback control system can turn an unstable state of the cavity into a stable one. It can
also provide greater stability margins to the already stable cavity. These effects of the servo can be
analyzed with the help of the servo potential.

9 Conclusions

The suspended mirrors in the Fabry-Perot cavity are described as a pair of harmonic oscillators driven
by nonlinear forces of the radiation pressure. The oscillators are not independent; they interact with
each other through the laser circulating in the cavity. The normal coordinates for the coupled oscil-
lators are the position of their center of mass and the cavity length, both affected by the delay in the
cavity. The radiation pressure has almost no effect on the motion of the center of mass, but affects
strongly the dynamics of the cavity length. To understand universal properties of the Fabry-Perot
cavity as a nonlinear dynamical system we introduced two parameters. These parameters determine
qualitative behavior of the dynamics of the cavity length common to all Fabry-Perot cavities with
suspended mirrors. The ﬁrst parameter determines whether the cavity is multistable or not. There is a
critical value for this parameter, at which the bifurcation occurs, and the cavity becomes multistable.
The second parameter is the generalized control force. It determines the locations of the equilibrium
states. If the control parameter varies within a wide range the equilibrium state of the cavity follows a
hysteresis loop. We analyze stability of the equilibrium states and identify the instability region. The
instability is explained in terms of the effective potential: stable states correspond to local minima of
the effective potential and unstable states correspond to local maxima. Each minimum of the effective
potential deﬁnes the resonance frequencies of the cavity length oscillations. These resonances make
the cavity a narrow band detector of any disturbances which affect the optical path of the laser in
the cavity, such as mechanical vibrations of the mirrors. The resonance frequencies can be tuned by
changing both of the parameters.

The nonlinear dynamics, described in this paper, provides grounds for building a control system
for the Fabry-Perot cavities in the interferometric gravitational detectors. Our results can also be used
in the studies of the Fabry-Perot cavities near the quantum limit.

1,
are deﬁned by the following equations:

Similarly, we deﬁne the amplitudes,E2 and E′

f1(0, t) = E1(t)eiωt,
f1(L0, t) = E′
1(t)eiωt.
2, for the left-moving wave:
f2(0, t) = E′
2(t)eiωt,
f2(L0, t) = E2(t)eiωt.

Since the wave functions satisfy the wave equation their values at different locations can be obtained
by delay:

Therefore, the amplitudes at the two reference planes are related to each other:

f1(L0, t) = f1(0, t

The equation for the reﬂection off the end mirror can be obtained from the condition of continuity

of the wave function at the mirror surface:

f2(L0 + xb, t) =

rbf1(L0 + xb, t).

Therefore, at the reference plane x = L0:

This equation can now be written in terms of the amplitudes:

C Some properties of Airy function

Here we present few basic properties Airy function, which are used throughout this paper. The Airy
function,

A(φ) =

1
1 + F sin2 φ

,

(113)

is a postitive, periodic function of φ with the period π. The Airy function depends on one parameter,
F , a positive number called the coefﬁcient of ﬁnesse. Fig. 14 shows Airy functions with different
coefﬁcients of ﬁnesse.

The half-width, φw, is the phase, at which the Airy function equals to half of its maximum value

The full width is equal to 2φw. Finesse is the ratio of the separation between the peaks to the full
width of the peak

The expression for the inﬂection points, eq. (117), and the maximum slope, eq. (118), are quite
complicated, therefore, it useful to ﬁnd simple approximate formulas for these quantities. For high
ﬁnesse cavities (large F - limit) such approximations can be easily found:

Any straight line, which has a slope greater than the maximum slope, intersects the Airy function at
only one point. If the slope of the line is less than the maximum slope the line can intersect the Airy
function at more than one point.

The integral of Airy function can be found in terms of elementary functions

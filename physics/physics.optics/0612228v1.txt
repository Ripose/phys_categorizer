Abstract

Using a TE/TM decomposition for an angular plane-wave spectrum of free random elec-

tromagnetic waves and matched boundary conditions, we derive the probability density func-

tion for the energy density of the vector electric ﬁeld in the presence of a semi-inﬁnite isotropic

medium. The theoretical analysis is illustrated with calculations and results for good elec-

tric conductors and for a lossless dielectric half-space. The inﬂuence of the permittivity

and conductivity on the intensity, random polarization, statistical distribution and standard

deviation of the ﬁeld is investigated, both for incident plus reﬂected ﬁelds and for refracted

ﬁelds. External refraction is found to result in compression of the ﬂuctuations of the random

ﬁeld.

Introduction

Complex electromagnetic (EM) environments are characterized by the fact EM ﬁelds behave

as random or quasi-random quantities. They can be studied in an eﬃcient manner with the

aid of statistical electromagnetics methods. With regard to the interaction of random ﬁelds

1

with their environment, a fundamental problem of interest is the evolution of statistical prop-

erties of the ﬁeld upon propagation through stratiﬁed media, including reﬂection and refraction

at their interfaces. For a perfectly electrically conducting (PEC) surface, previous studies of

the average value [Dunn, 1990], standard deviation and ﬁrst-order probability density function

(pdf) [Arnaut and West, 2006] of the electric and magnetic energy densities have demonstrated

a direction-dependent damped oscillatory behaviour of their average value and standard devi-

ation as a function of the distance of the point of evaluation to the interface. This behaviour

is a consequence of the interference between incident and reﬂected ﬁelds. As a result, unlike

for deterministic waves, a boundary zone exists for random ﬁelds adjacent to the PEC surface,

in which the statistical ﬁeld properties are inhomogeneous and fundamentally diﬀerent from

those at larger (theoretically inﬁnite) distance. Further insights that were gained from these

studies pertain to the statistical anisotropy and polarization state of the ﬁeld within the bound-

ary zone and, for vector ﬁelds, the transitions of the pdf of the energy density from one- or

two-dimensionally conﬁned random ﬁelds at the interface to fully developed three-dimensional

random ﬁelds at large electrical distances. In addition, spatial correlation functions have been

obtained previously for unbounded [Bourret, 1960], [Sarfatt, 1963], [Eckhardt et al.], [Mehta and

Wolf, 1964], [Hill and Ladbury, 2002] and single-interface [Arnaut, 2006a], [Arnaut 2006b] vec-

tor EM ﬁelds that elucidate the spatial structure of random ﬁelds via their two-point coherence

properties.

In the present paper, the methods and results for statistical properties of random ﬁelds near

a PEC surface are extended to a magneto-dielectric isotropic semi-inﬁnite medium. Having an-

alyzed the second-order spatial coherence and correlation properties for an impedance boundary

in [Arnaut, 2006b], here we are again concerned with ﬁrst-order statistical, i.e., local distribu-

tional properties only. Based on previous results for nonlocal spatial coherencies of the electric

ﬁeld

Eα(r1)E∗
h

β(r2)
i

(α, β = x, y, z), the polarization coeﬃcient and pdf for the local energy den-

sity are determined. Because of the single interface and isotropy of the medium, the polarization

coeﬃcient is degenerate, whence the pdfs are one-parameter compound exponential (CE-1) dis-

tributions [Arnaut, 2002], [Arnaut and West, 2006]. However, unlike for a PEC medium, the

angular spectra of reﬂected and refracted random ﬁelds exhibit directivity because reﬂection and

transmission coeﬃcients of plane waves for a magneto-dielectric semi-inﬁnite medium depend

2

on the wave polarization and angle of incidence. We shall conﬁne the analysis and results to

the electric ﬁeld E; corresponding results for the magnetic ﬁeld follow without diﬃculty. Since

we express results in terms of Fresnel reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients for an isotropic

half-space, analogous results for multilayer strata are easily obtained from the listed integral

expressions, on substituting with the appropriate coeﬃcients. In particular, probability distri-

butions of reﬂected and transmitted ﬁelds on either side of a single layer of ﬁnite thickness are

easily computed.

2 Field coherencies

Since random EM ﬁelds are spatially and temporally incoherent, their fundamental statistical

quantity is the energy density – rather than the ﬁeld itself or its magnitude – which is obtained

from the average ﬁeld intensities

of the Cartesian complex ﬁeld components Eα. These

2
Eα(r)
|

i

h|

intensities represent self-coherencies, which are special cases of mutual coherencies [Mehta and

Wolf, 1964]. The latter were derived in [Arnaut, 2006b] for the present conﬁguration. Here, the

fact that no separate transverse locations need to be considered in order to obtain ﬁrst-order

statistics considerably simpliﬁes the calculations.

2.1 Incident plus reﬂected random ﬁeld

We consider a semi-inﬁnite isotropic medium with permittivity ǫ and permeability µ occupying

the half-space z

0 (Fig. 1). The incident random ﬁeld at r in the region characterized by

≤

z > 0 is represented by a statistical ensemble (random angular spectrum) of time-harmonic

plane waves [Whittaker, 1902], [Booker and Clemmow, 1950], [Hill, 1998]:

Ei(r) =

1
2π

i(Ω) exp(

jki

r)dΩ,

−

·

Z ZΩ0 E

(1)

in which an exp(jωt) time dependence has been assumed and suppressed. This incident ﬁeld

Ei is assumed to be ideal random, i.e., any three complex Cartesian components, in particular

(Ei

x, Ei

y, Ei

z), are mutually independent and exhibit identical circular centered Gauss normal

distributions. The direction of incidence for each plane-wave component (

i,

i, ki) is arbitrary

E

H

within the upper hemisphere (Ω0 = 2π sr) and is speciﬁed by azimuthal (φ0) and elevational (θ0)

angles. Since the medium is deterministic, the incident and reﬂected ﬁelds for each individual

3

plane wave are mutually coherent, despite being individually random. Hence, their recombina-

tion in the region z > 0 is governed by superposition of ﬁelds, rather than energy densities. The

boundary condition does not aﬀect the correlation between ﬁeld components on either side of

the boundary, because

i is itself random. As a result, the ﬁeld components remain mutually

E

independent in the vicinity of the boundary. Since the Cartesian components of the incident

ﬁeld are circular Gaussians and because the medium is linear, the incident plus reﬂected vector

ﬁeld and its components are also circular Gauss normal with zero mean, but now with diﬀerent

standard deviations from those of the incident ﬁeld owing to the boundary conditions. Thus,

the three Cartesian components no longer exhibit identical parameters for their distributions.

Following [Dunn, 1990] and [Arnaut, 2006a], we perform a TE/TM decomposition for each

plane wave component of the angular spectrum with respect to its associated random plane of

incidence okiz, i.e., φ = φ0. As is well known, TE and TM polarizations constitute uncoupled

eigenpolarizations for stratiﬁed media, hence the polarization of the outgoing wave is completely

determined by that of the the incoming wave. As a result, the TE and TM contributions to

the overall plane-wave spectrum can be calculated independently. Ensemble averaging then

yields the TE and TM energy contents of the random ﬁeld. Speciﬁcally, for the TE components

incident at an angle θ0 and with electric ﬁeld

Figure 4 shows scaled pdfs fSe(se) for selected values of σ/(ωǫ0) at k0z = π/4. At this

intermediate distance, the pdfs rapidly approach the asymptotic distribution for Se near a PEC

wall [Arnaut and West, 2006] when σ/(ωǫ0) is increased. For larger k0z (not shown), the

inﬂuence of σ/(ωǫ0) on the pdf was found to be even weaker. On the other hand, very close

to the boundary (k0z

1), the pdf rapidly approaches a distribution close to the χ2

2 limit

≪

distribution when σ/(ωǫ0) is increased, as demonstrated in Fig. 5 for k0z = 0.01.

As indicated by Fig. 6(a), the standard deviation (std) σSe for the incident plus reﬂected total

ﬁeld exhibits increasing oscillations for intermediate distances and lower values upon approaching

the surface when conductivity is decreased. The std approaches a location-dependent asymptotic

value in the manner shown in Fig. 6(b).

4.2 Lossless dielectric medium

For a lossless medium, η, k, T⊥,k and Γ⊥,k are real-valued. Therefore, Iα3 and Iα4 are purely

imaginary so that only Iα1 and Iα2 contribute to the intensities

contributions near the Brewster angle for external refraction (ǫ/ǫ0 > 1). This eﬀect occurs in

5 Eﬀect of conductivity and permittivity on the magnitude of

ﬁeld ﬂuctuations

Since the probability distribution of each Cartesian component of the underlying complex ﬁeld

α remains circular Gauss normal, on either side of the interface with an isotropic

medium, the standard deviation of Eα can be deduced from the χ2

the ﬂuctuations of the refracted ﬁelds to exhibit a smaller spread compared to the ﬂuctuations

of the incident ﬁeld, where the latter are quantiﬁed by σEα with ǫ/ǫ0 = 1. This compression of

ﬂuctuations is seen to be more prominent for the normal ﬁeld component than for the tangential

ﬁeld. By contrast, Fig. 7(a) indicates that the spread of the incident plus reﬂected ﬁeld increases,

on average, with increasing permittivity.

6 Applications

Besides its interest as the solution to a fundamental problem in statistical electromagnetics, the

above analysis is relevant to several practical applications, of which we give a examples.

•

•

Atmospheric and ionospheric propagation of EM waves with applications, including spec-

troscopy of stellar light: Stellar light propagating through an atmosphere can be repre-

sented as a random ﬁeld radiated by a collection of incoherent point sources that are

distributed across one or several narrow solid angle(s) (cf.

[Arnaut, 2006b] for a treat-

ment of random ﬁelds produced by a spatially ﬁltered EM beam). Upon refraction by

atmospheric layers exhibiting permittivities close to ǫ0, the light undergoes a change in

its distributional and statistical polarization properties; cf. Figs. 7(b) and 8(b). Fur-

thermore, recall that the abovementioned plane-wave expansion refers to a harmonic or

quasi-harmonic (narrowband) ﬁeld for a speciﬁc central wavelength. Therefore, the pdfs of

light intensities associated with diﬀerent spectral lines may undergo diﬀerent changes upon

propagation, as a result of frequency dispersion of the medium, thus producing nonuni-

form changes of the mean values and standard deviations across the received spectrogram.

Similar considerations apply to scattered or reﬂected ﬁelds.

In this way, the presented

analysis yields corrections that could be instrumental in astrophysical observations and

Earth sciences, including remote sensing.

Reﬂection and refraction of multipath signals for wireless communications: An important

issue in the accurate prediction of multipath and wideband propagation through a radio

channel is the determination of transfer functions for incident and outgoing signals, and

how this transfer might aﬀect the properties (statistical and other) of the received signal.

12

By considering the ‘ratio’ of the pdfs in Figs. 4, 5, 9, or 11 relative to the χ2

6 asymptotic

distribution of the deep-ﬁeld energy density, one obtains a transfer function for fSe(se)

that captures the change in statistical properties, similar to the way in which Fresnel

reﬂection or refraction coeﬃcients relate incident to reﬂected or refracted ﬁelds. It also

yields information on the likelihood and extent of signal distortion.

Measurement of constitutive EM properties of materials inside a mode-stirred reverberation

•

chamber, including anisotropy, absorptivity, conductivity and/or permittivity of materials:

Several situations in which reverberant ﬁelds near a PEC surface are of practical relevance

were already mentioned in [Arnaut and West, 2006]; here, we focus on media with ﬁnite

σ/(ωǫ0) and ǫ only. Through the measurement of probability distributions of reﬂected

or refracted ﬁelds at a ﬁxed and suﬃciently close distance from the boundary of a semi-

inﬁnite medium or, by extension, from a ﬂat panel of suﬃcient large electrical thickness,

constitutive parameter values can be deduced using Figs. 4, 5, 9, 11 as a statistical

inversion problem [Arnaut, 2006b]. Alternatively, the spatial functional k0z-dependence

of the average electric energy density (particularly its normal component) can be compared

with the results in Figs. 2 or 7 to deduce these parameters, circumventing the need for

determining the pdf.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we have been concerned with the inﬂuence of the presence of a deterministic

semi-inﬁnite isotropic medium on the local ﬁrst-order statistical, i.e., distributional properties

of an ideal random electromagnetic ﬁeld for nondirectional (hemispherical) incidence. The EM

boundary conditions cause statistical anisotropy of the vector ﬁeld and a redistribution of the en-

ergy density between its tangential and normal components, compared to the statistical isotropy

and homogeneity of the incident ﬁeld. This modiﬁes its probability density function. For the

reﬂected plus incident ﬁeld, this modiﬁcation changes in a damped oscillatory manner as a func-

tion of distance from the interface; for refracted ﬁelds, the change is homogeneous within the

dielectric because no standing waves occur in this region. It was found that, for the tangential

and normal ﬁeld components, the presence of a dielectric alters their variability (as expressed by

their standard deviation) in an opposing manner, viz., for ǫ/ǫ0 > 1 the amplitude ﬂuctuations

13

of the refracted ﬁeld become more compressed, whereas for the incident plus reﬂected ﬁeld the

ﬂuctuations expand.

In this paper, the analytical formulation in terms of numerically solved integrals was made

possible by the simplicity of the geometry (single interface) and medium (isotropy). More

complex conﬁgurations involving multiple, ﬁnite, angled or curved interfaces, e.g., for interior

ﬁelds inside overmoded cavities or multiple-scattering problems, are unlikely to aﬀord such an

semi-analytical approach. In these cases, one may numerically calculate the statistics by using

a Monte Carlo simulation for angular spectra of random plane waves (or other suitable random

excitation) with speciﬁed input statistics. The numerically solved reﬂected and refracted ﬁelds

can then be collated and evaluated at a single location to yield the output statistics for these

ﬁelds (cf. Sec. V of [Arnaut and West, 2006]).

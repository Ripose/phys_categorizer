We develop a general theory of spatial solitons in a liquid crystalline medium exhibiting a non-
linearity with an arbitrary degree of eﬀective nonlocality. The model accounts the observability of
accessible solitons and establishes an important link with parametric solitons.

In various areas of applied nonlinear science, non-
locality plays a relevant role and radically aﬀects the
underlying physics. Some striking evidences are found
in plasma physics,[1, 2, 3] or in Bose-Einstein conden-
sates (BEC), [4, 5] where, contrary to the prediction
of purely local nonlinear models, nonlocality may give
rise to, or prevent, the collapse of a (plasma- or matter-

with self-localization and solitary waves, nonlocality is
often associated to time-domain phenomena through a
retarded response (see e.g. [6, 7]); spatially nonlocal ef-
fects have been associated to photorefractive [8, 9, 10, 11]
and thermal or diﬀusive responses [12, 13]. To assess
the role of nonlocality, theoretical studies tend to dis-
tinguish between highly and weakly nonlocal behaviors
[14, 15, 16], by comparing the spatial extent of the ma-
terial response (the so-called kernel-function) and the
optical beam waist. Speciﬁc kernel functions, however,
strongly depend on the physical system and, as in the
case of BEC, [5] they are hard to determine and apply
to experimental results. On the other hand, they are at
the basis of the theory of spatial optical solitons (SOS)
in highly nonlocal media.
SOS have become the subject of intense theoretical and
experimental investigations, both on the grounds of their
packet nature and in view of applications, particularly
in the exploitation of their wave-guiding character. [17]
Diverse material properties have been studied in conjunc-
tion with SOS existence and properties, including various
mechanisms able to counteract diﬀraction in one or both
transverse dimensions.
[18, 19] Spatial solitons due to
a local nonlinearity have been known since the original
work of Chiao, Garmire and Townes with reference to
Kerr media. [20] In 1997 Snyder and Mitchell [14] inves-
tigated SOS in a highly nonlocal system, i. e., a medium
exhibiting a power - rather than intensity - dependent re-
fractive index. They introduced the term accessible soli-
tons for those spatial solitary waves, owing to the sim-
plicity of the theory and transverse proﬁles obeying the
2-dimensional equation of a quantum harmonic oscillator
(which gives a gaussian proﬁle like the so-called “gaus-
sons” [21]). Shen pointed out to this connection as an
intriguing one between distinct ﬁelds of modern physics
and, provided the required large correlation lengths could

be made available, to the demonstration of accessible soli-
tons as a challenge well worth undertaking. [22]
In this Letter we introduce a model able to describe op-
tical spatial solitons and the smooth transition from the
purely local (in the limit of a Kerr nonlinearity) to the
entirely nonlocal case. While pursuing a general the-
ory, however, we chose to address a speciﬁc and available
nonlocal system, i. e., nematic liquid crystals (NLC) in
a planar cell. NLC have been proven to exhibit a sub-
stantial nonlocal nonlinearity of molecular origin [23] and
to support (2+1)-dimensional spatial solitons, [24] even
[25] Af-
in the case of spatially incoherent excitations.
ter deriving the ruling equations and deﬁning a suitable
nonlocal parameter able to span the soliton-family from
pure-Kerr or Townes-like (T-) to higly nonlocal or acces-
sible (A-) solitons, we will outline the rather remarkable
connection between our model and the equations describ-
ing quadratic two-color solitons (or simultons) in para-
metric media. [26]
Let us consider the simple geometry sketched in ﬁgure
1: a planar glass cell containing an undoped NLC with a
preset orientation of its molecular director. The aligned
liquid crystal, anchored at the bounding interfaces, be-
haves as a positive uniaxial with n//=nˆz and n
=nˆx.
In the presence of an external quasi-static (electric or
magnetic) ﬁeld or special anchoring at the interfaces, the
refractive index n(θ) in the (x, z) principal plane can ex-
hibit a distribution along x, with n
< n(θ(x)) < n//.
[27] For a light beam linearly polarized along x and prop-
agating along z, with transverse size well below the cell
thickness L, neglecting vectorial eﬀects and adopting the
paraxial approximation, the evolution of the optical en-
velope A is described by the Foch-Leontovich equation:

In the absence of a light wave, therefore, the orientation

following we will employ α as an arbitrary parameter
spanning the whole family of SOS; we expect large α
values to be associated to T-solitons, whereas small α
will address A-solitons. Note that, according to [3],
when ǫ = 0 the fundamental solitary wave solutions
of Eqs.(6) are stable because they realize an absolute
minimum of the Hamiltonian.

Noteworthy enough, system (8) is identical to what de-
termines the proﬁle of parametric spatial solitary waves
in χ(2)-media. [19, 26] This makes an unexpected connec-
tion between self-trapped beams in two distinct physical
systems encompassing rather diverse nonlinear optical re-
sponses: the ultrafast electronic nonlinearity of quadratic
crystals and the slow molecular re-orientation of liquid
crystals. The similarity is only limited to the proﬁles of
the solitary waves, while their dynamic properties, such
as stability, are quite diﬀerent. As shown below in a
practical case, to a ﬁrst approximation ǫ is negligible,
thus the angle “adiabatically-follows” the light beam; in
general this is not true for the harmonic-ﬁeld of a para-
metric soliton. It is well known, in fact, that for small
α the ψ-ﬁeld (the second-harmonic for χ(2) crystals, and
the re-orientation for NLC) is much wider than the a-
ﬁeld (see Torruellas et al.
in [19]). The opposite holds
in the χ(2)-SOS literature, this is the
true for α
Kerr-limit, its dynamics resembling that of χ(3) materi-
als. In NLC, for optical beams much wider than the re-
orientation proﬁle, T-solitons approximate well the solu-
tion (in the framework of the validity of the large cell ap-
proximation). The angle-proﬁle perturbation is localized
close to the optical beam axis, as typically pointed out
when addressing the Kerr-like response of NLC. [23, 27]
Here we are rather interested in the opposite limit.

In the ﬁgure we indicate the

Thus higher-order approximations imply anarmonicity of
the nonlocal potential, with a refractive index still de-
pending on power. As the latter increases, higher powers

local media with regards to the powers of the intensity.

In conclusions, for the ﬁrst time to our knowledge,
we have presented a self-consistent analytical theory of
two-dimensional spatial solitary waves in nonlocal me-
dia. Our model has an intriguing unifying character, as
it embraces several physical systems in which light self-
trapping has recently been investigated. We believe that
most of the observed SOS’ in nematic liquid crystals are
indeed accessible solitons, in-as-much-as NLC are highly
nonlocal. This shines new light on self-localization in liq-
uid crystals. Furthermore, we have presented the ﬁrst
derivation of a power-dependent constitutive relation for
a real physical system, never reported elsewhere. We con-
ﬁde that our results will stimulate new experiments to-
wards a deeper understanding of self-trapping in (highly)
nonlocal nonlinear media and the development of novel
all-optical devices. [29]

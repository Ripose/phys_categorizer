We investigate optical parametric oscillations through four-wave mixing in resonant cavities and
photonic crystals. The theoretical analysis underlines the relevant features of the phenomenon and
the role of the density of states. Using fully vectorial 3D time-domain simulations, including both
dispersion and nonlinear polarization, for the ﬁrst time we address this process in a face centered
cubic lattice and in a photonic crystal slab. The results lead the way to the development of novel
parametric sources in isotropic media.

Photonic crystals (PC) are synthetic structures de-
signed for speciﬁc optical applications, realized by a (2 or
3D) periodic pattern embedded in a bulk material. PC
exhibit forbidden and allowed frequency bands of states
for electromagnetic waves, depending on dielectric con-
stants and geometric features, light polarization and di-
rection of propagation. The analogy to solid state crys-
tals in electronics is at the origin of their name [1, 2, 3, 4].
An alternative way to view PC is in terms of a peri-
odic tight distribution of resonant cavities (RC), such
that the resulting system presents bands of states owing
to mode splitting in the elemental RC. A description of
these structures exclusively in terms of free propagation
within the allowed bands is rather limiting, especially in
high-index contrast and ﬁnite-dimension PC.

The resonant response of PC is manifestly relevant
when considering nonlinear optical processes. By their
very nature, in fact, the latter can couple cavity modes,
yielding a spectrum which is expected to signiﬁcantly
depend on the speciﬁc distribution of states. If suﬃcient
energy is available, the interplay between frequency (or
mode) mixing and cavity eﬀects may build up oscillations
driven by the nonlinear gain. In PC, a high Q-factor [5]
entails low thresholds and, hence, a broad output spec-
trum which peaks at the most state-crowded frequencies.
While quadratic nonlinearities are the basis of most
optical parametric oscillators (OPO), the process of four-
wave mixing (FWM) in a cubic medium can trigger non-
(see e.g.
linear gain and hence oscillations, as well.
[6, 7, 8, 9], and references therein) Since it is present in all
dielectrics, a cubic nonlinearity is an excellent candidate
for highly integrated parametric sources in PC, their re-
alization crucially depending on materials. Furthermore,
the large density-of-states (DOS) characteristic of PC re-
laxes the selection rules that govern FWM parametric
gain in resonant structures, [6] while providing several
synchronized (phase-matched) interactions. The strict
conditions that aﬀect FWM in microresonator (without
PC) have been pointed out in [10], where the observa-
tion of very low threshold (due to high Q-factor) Raman
lasing has been reported.

In this Letter we present a general model of OPO
through FWM in photonic crystals and cavities real-
ized in isotropic materials (and hence lacking a quadratic
nonlinearity). Such possibility is then veriﬁed by means
of extensive vectorial time domain simulations, using a
ﬁnite-diﬀerence-time-domain (FDTD) parallel algorithm
which accounts for material dispersion in both the linear
and nonlinear regimes. To the best of our knowledge,
these are the ﬁrst fully comprehensive 3D vectorial time-
domain simulations of cavities and PC encompassing dis-
persion and a cubic optical response.

Nonlinear optical phenomena in high index contrast
3D-PC were previously investigated numerically with ref-
erence to an instantaneous third-order nonlinearity, and
to its role in distorting the band-structure [11, 12]. A
general theory was developed in [13] using the “eﬀec-
tive medium” approach but leaving aside the resonant
features. More recently, some experimental studies have
been reported in PC [14] (see also [15] for an updated
review on nonlinear photonic crystals).

Hereby we focus, both theoretically and numerically,
on frequency coupling associated to collective phenom-
ena between several states in cavities. Let us consider
an RC, or a PC of ﬁnite extent, realized in an instanta-
neous isotropic medium. The PC is deﬁned by a position-
dependent refractive index n(r), in a region of volume V
and surface S over which periodic boundary conditions
are enforced. Electric and magnetic ﬁelds can therefore
be expandend in terms of cavity eigenfunctions, denoted
by a generalized index µ, according to

In (1), as usual, the summation is extended over nega-
tive frequencies in order to make the ﬁelds real-valued,
with

ing the Lorentz reciprocity theorem to an instantaneously

Being interested in optical parametric oscillations due
to a cubic nonlinearity, we consider a mode of ampli-
tude a and frequency ω which, pumped by some external
source, couples with two other modes of amplitues a+ and
a− at frequencies ω± respectively, such that ω+ + ω− =
2ω. Therefore, in the stationary regime (3) reads (for

As in standard OPO’s, the latter shows that the excess

Once the system is oscillating all the modes will vibrate

in the proximity of the photonic
band-gap (PBG) for a PC or near cut-oﬀ for an RC.[18]
It is important to determine the bandwidth of the
pump modes. The pump, at frequency ωin, transfers
energy to each mode at ω = ωin −
δ, according to its
Lorentzian lineshape. We can account for this eﬀect by
writing the source term as pe−iδt and solving the time-
dependent coupled equations. This leads to replacing κ
and ω by κ + iδ and ωin, respectively, in the ﬁrst of (4),
and in corresponding ansatz’s for a±. As a result, when

With the aim of demonstrating the feasibility of OPO’s
in isotropic PC/RC, we performed fully vectorial numer-

In the algorithm, the Yee’s grid [21] was used to enforce
continuity between diﬀerent media, and uniaxial phase-
matched layers (UPML) were adopted at the bound-
aries [22] (details will be provided elsewhere). Partic-
ular care is required in adopting a speciﬁc form of the
Lorentz oscillator f (P ), with f (P ) = 1 describing a
linear single-pole dispersive medium. For an isotropic
Kerr material we followed the suggestion by Koga [23],
f (P ) = [1 + (P/P0)2]−3/2 (P0 is a measure of
i.e.
the nonlinearity). For small P/P0 the latter reproduces
a Kerr response while also accounting for higher order
terms. Compared to the standard Kerr f (P ) = 1 + χP 2,
the resulting algorithm is stable even near the Courant
limit.[22] For the eﬀective Kerr-law coeﬃcient n2 we

resources needed for such a numerical approach, we par-
allelized the algorithm. [30]

A proper test-bed for our theoretical analysis is pro-
vided by a dispersive medium with non-instantaneous lin-
ear and nonlinear responses, modeled by (11) and solved
numerically with no-approximations. We computed the
response of a Face-Centered-Cubic (FCC) lattice (of pe-
riod Λ) of air-spheres (radius r = 0.3535Λ) embedded
in a dielectric. This is one of the simplest structures
admitting a complete PBG [25]. The PC, of dimen-
sions 8µm
8µm, was placed in air and excited
by a 2µm-waist linearly y-polarized gaussian beam, ob-
tained by a total ﬁeld/scattered ﬁeld layer.[22] The input
temporal proﬁle, for the quasi-cw excitation mentioned
below, exhibited smooth transitions from zero to con-
tinuous wave, as mimicked by an mnm pulse (m = 2,
n = 107).
[26] Its spectrum was well peaked about the
carrier frequency. The FCC lattice for a material with
index 3.5, such as Si or GaAs, has a complete band gap
around a normalized frequency Λ/λ = 0.8, with λ the
wavelength. To get a gap near λ = 1500nm we chose
Λ = 1200nm, and the parameters of the single pole dis-
1016
persion were taken as ǫs = 11.971392, ω0 = 1.1
105 (in MKS units), yielding an index ∼= 3.5
and γ0 = 2
at λ ∼= 1500nm. The integration domain was discretized
with dx ∼= dy ∼= dz ∼= 30nm and time step dt = 0.03f s,
allowing more than 40 points at each wavelength around
λ = 1500nm and runs with 20000 steps in time (the spec-
tral resolution is of the order of 10nm at λ = 1500nm).
The DOS is typically calculated by the use of plane-
wave expansion, omitting material dispersion and for in-
ﬁnitely extended structures (see, e.g., [25, 27]). Hence,
it is all but straightforward the application of the stan-
dard approach to the case under consideration. For this

reason, we resorted to a time-domain approach to deter-
mine the states of the FCC-PC. A very low-power (1nW )
single-cycle pulse [26] excited the PC (along the ΓX di-
rection) and the transmitted signal (its Ey component)
was analyzed just after it. The resulting spectrum is
shown in ﬁgure 1, where the peaks correspond to con-
centrations of states (taken aside the low-frequency os-
cillations due to the ﬁnitess of the structure [4]) compat-
ibly with symmetry constraints. The band structure of
this medium encompasses a PBG around 1500nm and a
pseudo-gap around 2400nm.

In ﬁgure 2 we display the Ey spectrum obtained in
a low-symmetry point at the center of the PC, for a
beam propagating along the direction ΓX. Diﬀerent in-
put powers were injected with a 600f s quasi-cw excita-
tion. The pump wavelength λ ∼= 1336nm corresponds to
Λ/λ = 0.898, i.e. close to a state by the (frequency) up-
per edge of the PBG, as indicated by the star in ﬁgure 1.
As visible in the insets, large output spectra are attained.
No oscillations appear at frequencies within the PBG,
with a smooth spectrum in the large wavelength region
and several peaks above the PBG upper edge. Each peak
corresponds to a region dense of states,[25] and hence to
an eﬃciently generated frequency.

As a second representative case, we considered a pho-
tonic crystal slab with a triangular lattice (Λ = 450nm,
hole radius r = 135nm), as experimentally investigated
in [28]. The slab is 270nm thick, with in-plane size
2µm
It is pumped by a 0.5µm-waist TE-like
polarized gaussian beam incident along the ΓM direc-
tion. The pump wavelengths are in proximity of the
upper and the lower edges of the guided-modes gap (lo-
cated in the interval 1260-1750nm for the inﬁnite non-
dispersive structure), and the material constants are
1016, γ0 = 0, P0 = 1, ǫs = 10.9379,
ω0 = 1.1
and refractive index n ∼= 3.3 as in Al0.1Ga0.9As at
[29] The discretization was implemented
λ = 1800nm.

Several excited wavelengths correspond to the spectral peaks
in ﬁgure 1. The asterisk marks the pump wavelength. The
insets are close-ups of the spectral interval around 1200nm
for diﬀerent input levels. At high powers a slight shift of the
resonance peaks is due to self- and cross-phase modulation.

λ = 2000nm, by the lower edge. The inset shows the output
spectrum for the low power (1nW ) single cycle excitation, the
stars indicate the OPO pumps.

with dx ∼= 15nm, dy ∼= 25nm, dz ∼= 19nm, dt ∼= 0.02f s,
and both single cycle and cw feeding were carried out for
up to 30000 steps in time (∼= 600f s). Figure 3 shows
OPO spectra of the transmitted ﬁeld for pump wave-
lengths λ = 1250 and 2000nm, respectively (mnm pulse,
m = 5, n = 600), and input power Pin = 100kW . Even
at such low power, the broadening is enhanced owing to
the spatial conﬁnement aﬀorded by a planar geometry.

In conclusion, we have analyzed optical parametric os-
cillations in photonic crystal cavities. Through fully vec-
torial 3D numerical simulations we have demonstrated
that regions of signiﬁcant mode-concentration and high
Q-factors favor the onset of parametric oscillations due
to four-wave mixing gain. Moreover, a properly tai-
lored DOS can favor the generation of speciﬁc frequen-
cies, making nonlinear ampliﬁcation possible even with
isotropic (i.e. centrosymmetric) materials in microcav-
ities. These results pave the way to novel genera-

tions of speciﬁcally tailored parametric sources employ-
ing isotropic materials in highly integrated geometries.

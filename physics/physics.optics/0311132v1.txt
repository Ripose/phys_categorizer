The interaction of an atomic gas conﬁned inside a cavity with a strong electromagnetic ﬁeld is
numerically and theoretically investigated in a regime where recoil eﬀects are not negligible. The
spontaneous appearance of a density grating (atomic bunching) accompanied by the onset of coherent
backpropagation is found to be ruled by a continuous phase-transition. Numerical tests allow us
to convincingly prove that the transition is steered by the appearence of a periodic atomic density
modulation. Consideration of diﬀerent experimental relaxation mechanisms induces us to analyze
the problem in nearly analytic form, in the large detuning limit, using both a Vlasov approach and
a Fokker-Planck description. The application of our predictions to recent experimental ﬁndings,
reported in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 183601 (2003)], yields a semi-quantitative agreement with the
observations.

INTRODUCTION

Recoil in the interaction between atoms and electro-
magnetic ﬁelds is almost exclusively associated with the
idea that momentum transfer is a way of slowing down
atoms to extremely low-temperatures [1]. However, non
trivial consequences on light propagation have been un-
covered as well. For instance, in the realm of single-atom
eﬀects, the so-called Recoil Induced Resonances (RIR)
have been investigated both theoretically [2] and exper-
imentally [3]. Moreover, it has been conjectured that
atomic recoil can collectively give rise to coherent propa-
gation through backreﬂection from a spontaneously gen-
erated density grating: the so called Collective Atomic
Recoil Laser (CARL) [4]. Finally, connections between
the two approaches have been investigated in [5].

The very ﬁrst observation of spontaneous backward
emission was made in a ring cavity experiment [6], where
the very low “transverse temperature” might have been
responsible for CARL ampliﬁcation. More detailed ex-
perimental accounts have been reported in Refs. [7, 8],
although it was not possible to establish whether the
generation of the backward ﬁeld was due to the spon-
taneous formation of a density grating, or viceversa. In
fact, although it was later ascertained that recoil plays
a prominent role [9] in the underlying physics [7, 8], an
alternative interpretation based on the formation of a
standard polarization grating could not be entirely ruled
out [10]. Only recently has the ﬁrst convincing evidence
of CARL been given in a beautiful experiment performed
on a sample of cold Rubidium atoms [11].

On the theoretical side, too, no ﬁnal conclusion could
be drawn on the CARL features, because the ﬁrst model
allowed only investigating the transient regime. Station-
ary states have been obtained for the ﬁrst time by includ-

ing collisions with an external buﬀer gas [12]. By simu-
lating a low-temperature (a few mK) sodium vapour in
the detuning range previously considered in the (numeri-
cal) literature, a nonequilibrium phase transition leading
to a stationary nonzero backward ﬁeld (above a given
threshold) was therein identiﬁed. However, such a col-
lective phenomenon could not be linked to the onset of
a density grating, but rather to the birth of a nontrivial
polarization grating [12].

The overall scenario has been observed also in a more
general model accounting for the input-ﬁeld dynam-
ics [13] and has been successively clariﬁed in [14] with
the help of the elimination of the atomic variables; in-
deed, this step rendered the derivation of an eﬀective
free-energy potential for the backward ﬁeld amplitude
possible, thereby clearly showing the existence of a phase
transition.

In this paper we show numerically and theoretically
that this latter model also accounts for the CARL and al-
lows one to understand its onset in terms of a continuous
phase transition characterized by two eﬀective variables.
The resulting estimate of the critical point is compati-
ble with the experimental results reported in [11]. The
results presented here provide the ﬁrst substantial and
systematic progress towards a proof of the existence, in
stable form, of a collective interaction, which, predicted
years ago [4], had so far proven to be elusive.

More precisely, we investigate the transition which
gives rise, spontaneously – i.e., without an external probe
ﬁeld –, to a coherent electromagnetic ﬁeld counterpropa-
gating with respect to the injected one. We choose to con-
sider the ring-cavity-based model introduced in [13, 15]
for two reasons. On the one hand, the available single-
pass model [4] has intrinsic shortcomings [16] which may
be of little consequence in particular circumstances, but

which renders it nonetheless less attractive. On the other
hand, the most recent experimental results [11], which
can be considered at the present time as the ﬁrst and
only available observation of a true CARL system, have
been obtained in a ring cavity. Hence, the choice of a
bidirectional ring cavity model imposes itself.

A strong concern, which tainted all previous predic-
tions and experimental attempts at studying this prob-
lem, regards the inﬂuence of external perturbations (col-
lisions, ﬁnite transit time in the interaction volume, “op-
tical friction”, etc.) on the collective dynamics. One can
conjecture that their presence could destroy the phase
transition or, at least, aﬀect it so strongly as to shift
it to an unphysical region of parameter values. Our pur-
pose in this work is to investigate such mechanisms using
diﬀerent approaches and mathematical/numerical tools,
to obtain a convincing picture. Section II introduces
the model we used in the investigation and discusses, in
subsectionII A, the main physical relaxation mechanisms
that may take place in an experiment. The appropriate
modeling tools for analyzing the two main mechanisms
are introduced here. Section III is devoted to a system-
atic numerical analysis which allows us to highlight the
origin of the forces that give rise to a transition of the
CARL-type – i.e., caused by the appearence of a spatial
density grating – as opposed to the one recently pre-
dicted [12, 14], based on an unusual polarization grat-
ing and possibly responsible for high-temperature ex-
perimental observations [7, 8]. The numerical approach
makes it possible to isolate the diﬀerent source terms
and identify in which range of temperature each of them
is predominant. Analytical descriptions present the ad-
vantage of oﬀering a better understanding of the physics
driving the system. Since the full problem is obviously
analytically unmanageable, it is useful to study some lim-
iting situations. This is done in Section IV, where we con-
sider the case of large detuning between ﬁelds and atomic
resonance. In this spirit, we describe the perturbations
introduced by transit broadening (subsection IV A) and
show that a second-order transition appears which can
be described by expanding the spatial inhomogeneities in
Fourier modes. The ﬁrst and most relevant mode coin-
cides with the bunching parameter, previously introduced
to quantify the density grating [4]. Losses introduced by
an optical molasses are studied in subsection IV B with
the help of a Fokker-Planck equation that can be ana-
lytically solved in the large dissipation limit. Predictions
resulting from the preceding analyses are oﬀered in Sec-
tion V, together with a comparison with the recent exper-
imental results [11]. Some conclusions and perspectives
are presented in Section VI.

A. Relaxation mechanisms

While dissipation mechanisms aﬀecting the internal de-
grees of freedom and the ﬁeld amplitudes are accounted
for by the above model, no losses acting on the atomic
momentum are therein included. As a result, atoms
are continuously accelerated by radiation pressure, and
Eqs. (1) can thereby describe only the transient regime
corresponding to the early stages of CARL ampliﬁcation.
In actual experimental situations, relaxation processes
may be induced by various mechanisms, the main ones
being: (a) collisions with a buﬀer gas (those between
optically active atoms can be neglected under all realis-
tic circumstances), (b) ﬁnite residence time in the in-
teraction volume (added to some relaxation occurring
outside it), and (c) “viscous” losses (e.g., as in an op-
tical molasses). Collisions with a buﬀer gas require fairly
high pressures and have been often used in the inves-
tigation of nonlinear coupling between atoms and light
(cf., e.g., [17, 18]).
In a numerical scheme, this relax-
ation processes can be implemented as a coupling with a
thermal bath, eﬃciently simulated with “molecular dy-

namics” [19] techniques. More precisely, a random se-
quence of inter-collision times is independently gener-
ated for each atom according to an exponential distribu-
tion with average value equal to 1/γc. At each collision,
the momentum of the colliding, j-th, atom is randomly
reset according to the Gaussian distribution Q0(pj) =
/√2πT where T = kB ¯T k2/(mκ2) is the
exp
rescaled temperature of the buﬀer gas (kB is Boltzmann’s
constant, ¯T is the temperature in physical units); more-
over, the phase of the atomic polarization sj is also re-
set to a value uniformly distributed in the whole range
[0, 2π], as
remains unchanged. Notice that this algo-
rithm amounts to implicitely assuming that active and
buﬀer-gas atoms have equal masses.

The ﬁnite transit time (b) introduces eﬀective losses
and has certainly played the main role in several exper-
iments [6, 7, 8]. In such a situation, the atoms spend a
more or less small fraction of time inside the interaction
volume, which they enter and exit at random positions
and in a random state (both for the velocity and for the
internal degrees of freedom). Outside the interaction re-
gion, the atoms suﬀer thermalization, either through col-
lisions with other atoms (e.g., a low pressure buﬀer gas),
with a container, or are simply renewed through “fresh”
atoms coming from a beam; hence, the eﬀective relax-
ation comes from the loss of “synchronized” atoms (both
for the external and the internal degrees of freedom) com-
pensated, in average, by the entrance into the interaction
volume, of “random” atoms. This phenomenon can be
reinterpreted as a “reset” in the external and internal
degrees of freedom of the atom in question. At the mi-
croscopic level, one can still adopt a description based on
the thermalization scheme discussed in (a), by modelling
each random exit/entrance in the active volume as a “col-
lision”; the main diﬀerence with the previous case is that
all atomic variables have now to be reset. At the macro-
scopic level, the mathematical tool most suited for such
a description is a Vlasov equation, where the probability
distribution for the atomic position and momentum are
dynamically investigated. These considerations are the
basis for the discussion of Section IV A.

The third mechanism (c), recently employed in [11],
is an optical molasses, added in the experiment to ob-
tain steady state backward emission. Here, the “molasses
ﬁeld” slows down the atoms by the standard cooling ac-
tion while introducing a “friction” which prevents the
Doppler shift from growing so large as to render the in-
teraction with the ﬁeld entirely negligible. It has been
shown [20] that under the assumption of a small satu-
ration parameter of the molasses ﬁeld, the momentum
dynamics is well described by a Langevin equation (com-
pare with the second of Eqs. (1)),

(δjk is the Kronecker symbol) accounting for the in-
evitable ﬂuctuations that thermalize the atom to a ﬁnite
temperature T . In Section IV B, we will study this model
in the limit of large detuning, a condition well veriﬁed in
the experiment [11].

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We now intend to explore the predictions of the model,
Eqs. 1, from a purely numerical point of view to pro-
vide a starting point for the later analysis. In particular,
we are interested in studying the existence of a steady
state bunching in the presence of a backward propagat-
ing ﬁeld. We remark that the observation of a stable
value of bunching in a bidirectional ring cavity has never
been reported. Previous observations, obtained without
cavity [4], have shown a strongly oscillating, irregular be-
haviour for this variable. In the other kind of observed
transition [12, 13], instead, the θ distribution remains
ﬂat (within the ﬂuctuations imposed by the sample size)
both below and above threshold. Hence, the mere numer-
ical observation of a stable, steady bunching represents
an important step towards generalizing the CARL pre-
dictions [4].

Such an observation is, however, not suﬃcient in it-
self. The question arises naturally, whether the backward
ﬁeld is originated by the growth of a nonhomogenous
longitudinal atomic distribution, or whether the spatial
inhomogeneity results as a consequence of a preexisting
optical standing wave, generated by other source terms.
Although apparently obvious, this point is far from being
trivial. Indeed, any standing wave is going to generate a
whole hierarchy of gratings (atomic polarization and in-
version, index of refraction and – if the atoms are free to
move – atomic density), but one needs to identify the true
source. In this system, a source term which gives rise to
a collective state has already been identiﬁed in the non-
trivial grating in the atomic polarization’s phase [12, 14],
while a standard polarization modulation (without phase
transition) has been proposed [10] as a possible mecha-
nism for interpreting experimental observations [7, 8].

In order to characterize the appearence of a spatial
inhomogeneity in the atomic distribution, we introduce
the characteristic function of the position (zj) distribu-
tion deﬁned in terms of its Fourier modes

Fig. 1a shows the appearence of several Fourier modes,
which reach a steady state amplitude after the backward
ﬁeld has grown to its ﬁnal value (Fig. 1b, solid line).
We stress that the latter grows from zero spontaneously,
without any seed being injected in the computation.

From Fig. 1a we remark that one Fourier component of
the atomic spatial distribution signiﬁcantly grows away
from zero well before the backward ﬁeld begins to de-
viate from its initial value. We will take this as a sug-
gestion, to be later veriﬁed, that the bunching is respon-
sible for the appearence of the counterpropagating ﬁeld.
The harmonic components, instead, seem to be generated
by the interaction of the inhomogeneously distributed
atoms and the optical standing wave generated by the
two macroscopic counterpropagating ﬁelds, (xf and xb).
In addition, we also see how the forward ﬁeld (dashed
line in Fig. 1b) is modiﬁed by the presence of the spa-
tially modulated atomic distribution.

The physical picture described by this ﬁgure is the fol-
lowing: the cavity initially contains the atoms and no
ﬁelds. At time t = 0, we start injecting the external com-
ponent Y , collinear with the forward direction. During
the transient preceding synchronisation, the atoms use
part of the energy to adapt their positions and velocities,
thus building up a non homogeneous spatial distribution.
We remark that the total energy injected into the cav-
ity (see dot-dashed line) is larger than that contained in
the two ﬁeld components at steady state (t > 300 time
units). The fact that both ﬁelds, xf and xb, grow nearly
to the same value implies that one cannot neglect the
dynamics of the forward ﬁeld. This dynamics maximizes
the spatial modulation and both ﬁelds adapt themselves
to the global coupling that ensues. It is also crucial to
remark that, although the spatial atomic inhomogeneity
appears to be responsible for the generation of the back-
ward ﬁeld, at time t
230 time units, the B1 component
has reached only one third of its ﬁnal value. Hence, the
rest of the modulation (fundamental plus all the harmon-
ics), results from the interaction with the optical stand-
ing wave. This point is signiﬁcant, since it implies that
the scattering from one ﬁeld into the other is going to
be quite symmetric: any increase in one component will
imply a larger number of photons in one direction, hence
a larger scattered contribution from that direction into
the other. The residual diﬀerence between the forward
(dashed line, Fig. 1a) and the backward ﬁeld is to be
attributed to the fact that the former receives an addi-
tional contribution from the external injection; hence the
corresponding mode contains more photons at any time.

A more convincing illustration of the active role played
by the density grating in the generation of the backward
ﬁeld, can be gained by decomposing the “force” ﬁeld act-

In order to gain some insight on the resulting dynamics,
we compare the force ﬁelds generated in the presence and
in the absence of bunching, respectively. We do this un-
der the assumption that the atomic degrees of freedom
can be neglected [21], i.e. that the relevant dynamical

amplitudes. In principle, one should also take care of the
time-dependence associated with the detuning ν between
the two ﬁelds; however, numerical simulations of the full
model have revealed that the “force” ﬁeld depends very
weakly on ν. The force resulting for the same parameter
values as in Fig. 1 is plotted in Fig. 2 for diﬀerent values
of the backward ﬁeld amplitude. The solid line with no

bunching (i.e., as a master or a slave variable), we have
proceeded to “switching oﬀ” both collisions and optical
forces acting on the atoms (this is obviously possible only
in a simulation). The corresponding curves representing
, (solid
FA (dashed line in Fig. 2) and the total force,
line) are identiﬁed by symbols. As a result of the absence
of external perturbations, each atomic position θj evolves
linearly according to the velocity value at the “switch oﬀ”
time; in this way, the density grating is rapidly washed
out. This procedure allows us to separate the possible
gain component coming from the density grating from
the one arising in a pumped ensemble of two-level sys-
tems [22]. The stationary value of
FA under such condi-
tions remains always negative (so does a fortiori the total
force), indicating that the presence of a density grating is
an indispensable ingredient to maintain a ﬁnite backward
ﬁeld. Notice that this is at variance with the transition
studied in [12], where the force ﬁeld would be positive
even in the absence of a density grating [14]. Hence, we
can safely conclude that the onset of a ﬁnite backward
ﬁeld is a clear example of CARL and that the steady state
bunching obtained is the cause for the appearence for the
backward ﬁeld component, and not a consequence of the
existence of an optical standing wave (cf., e.g., [10]) in
the parameter range which we are investigating.

IV. LARGE DETUNING LIMIT

In Section III we have just reported purely numerical
observations. In the perspective of constructing an an-
alytical description of the transition, it is important to
identify the possibly few relevant variables. For this pur-
pose we concentrate on the large detuning limit, where
the standard adiabatic elimination holds. Although this
allows us to analytically treat only a limiting case, we will
draw from it the beneﬁt of later comparing the predic-
tions of this approach to the recent experimental obser-
vations [11], obtained with very large detuning between

Section V.

By setting, in Eqs. (1),

where C = ˜CG/∆a, and ¯∆ = ∆c + C accounts for the
combined eﬀect of atomic and cavity frequency shifts in
the absence of bunching (i.e. B1 = B−1 = 0). The above
form is similar to the one discussed in [23], which was,
however, obtained by phenomenologically adding relax-
ation terms to a single pass model [24].

A. Vlasov Model

It is now convenient to pass to a Vlasov-like descrip-
tion by introducing the distribution Q(θ, p) of positions
and momenta. In order to simplify the analysis we now
assume that also the atomic positions are randomized in
each collision [25]. Accordingly, we can write

∂tQ + p∂θQ +

m(xf x∗

(9)

where ∂y denotes the partial derivative with respect to
y. In the absence of a backward ﬁeld, Q(θ, p) converges
towards the equilibrium distribution Q0.

We now study the stability of the solution xf =
Y /(1 + i ¯∆) := Y0, xb = 0, and Q = Q0, by introducing
the perturbations δxf , δxb, δQ. Since the equation for xf
depends on the other variables only at second order in the
perturbations, it can be solved separately. Moreover, δxf
aﬀects δxb only at second order, so that it can be factored
out. Therefore, the stability of δxf justiﬁes the assump-
tions made in deriving the single-pass model where xf is
considered to be a constant parameter [4, 12, 14]. One is
thus left with the following two equations

From the structure of such equations we see that if the
bunching is washed out – i.e., B±1 = 0 and δQ = 0 –
no instability can be expected in this regime. This is
at variance with the case discussed in [12, 14] where the

eﬀective stability of xb can be turned into an instability
suﬃciently close to the atomic resonance.

From Eq. (10), one realizes that the coupling occurs
through the ﬁrst Fourier mode of the density distribution.
One can thus solve the above equation by introducting
the following Ans¨atze,

Within this framework, the onset of both bunching and
backward ﬁeld is signalled by a change of sign of the real
part of λ, λr[26]. The integral in Eq. (15) can be ana-
lytically expressed using an error function. Nevertheless,
this would hide an important point. Let place ourselves
at threshold, and rewrite Eq. (15), assuming that λ is
purely imaginary. Setting λ =

must be fulﬁlled. The numerator is an odd function of
p. The sign of the integral in Eq. (17) is thus deter-
mined by the denominator, whose minimum is reached at
po =
β/2. Finally, Eq. (17) imposes β < 0. From the
sign convention adopted here (the same that in Ref. [13]),
a complex ﬁeld E, of frequency ω, is linked to its slowly
varying envelope A as E = A exp[
iωt]. Thus β physi-
cally represents the detuning between the backward ﬁeld
and the forward ﬁeld. One can thus conclude that the
spontaneous symmetry breaking causing xb to rise can
only give rise to a red detuned ﬁeld.

B. Fokker-Planck description

We now turn to analyzing the relaxation mechanism
that most closely models the recent experimental re-
sults [11]. There, the cw superposition of additional

6

laser beams, tuned to the D2 transition of Rubidium,
introduces a mechanism which slows down those atoms
that would be accelerated away from resonance by the
strong interaction arising from CARL. Indeed, it was re-
ported [11] that in the absence of the molasses only tran-
sient backwards emission could take place (and its inter-
pretation as CARL is complicated by the technique used
for preparing the sample, which pre-traps the atoms in a
standing wave). The key point in the experiment is that
the molasses is always present during the interaction but
on the other D-line (the experiment being done on the
D1).

In the large detuning limit, the second of Eq. (8) is

˙pj =

m(xf x∗

γpj + ηj (t).

(18)

Eq. (18) describes the evolution of (θ, p) in a potential
self-consistently determined by the dynamics of the two
counter-propagating ﬁeld components, xf and xb, which
in turn depends on the joint distribution Q(θ, p). The
evolution of Q corresponding to Eq. (18), is given by the
Fokker-Planck equation

∂tQ + p∂θQ +

In view of its diﬀerential structure, it is doubtful whether
a general analytic solution can be found, and the devel-
opment of a numerical analysis would be a quite deli-
cate task as well. Nevertheless, in the “strong friction”
(SF) limit, the atomic momentum can be adiabatically
eliminated and one can thereby perform a quite detailed
investigation of the transition scenario. While a careful
discussion of the adiabatic elimination in the presence of
noise can be found in Ref. [27], here we limit ourselves to
presenting a sketchy but substantially correct derivation
where we set ˙p = 0 in Eq. (18). By proceeding in this
way, one obtains the Langevin equation

We remark that Eq. (22), which describes the dynam-

longs to the class of Kuramoto systems [28]. The main
diﬀerences are: a Dirac-like distribution of eigenfrequen-
cies and a mean ﬁeld self-consistently provided by a dy-
namical equation. By paralleling the approach in Sec-
tion IV A, the stability of the solution xf = ¯Y , xb = 0,
ρ = 1/2π can be studied by introducing the inﬁnitesimal
perturbations δxb and δρ. The linearisation of Eq. (23)

Z0 has to be computed numerically.

V. PREDICTIONS

In this section we discuss the results derived in Sec-
tion IV in the large detuning limit for both the Fokker-
Planck (see Sec. IV B) and Vlasov (Sec. IV A) models.
We ﬁrst test the validity of the two approaches by com-
paring them to the experimental results of Ref. [11]. The
experiment has been performed with cold 85Rb atoms
in a high-Q ring cavity. The atomic parameters are:

D

= 1.5 10−29Cm−1 with relaxation
m = 1.4 10−29kg,
rates for atomic polarisation and inversion 2γ⊥ = γk =
5.9MHz, respectively. Moreover, the atomic frequency
1014Hz (for the D1 line), while the in-
is ω = 3.77
put ﬁeld is shifted 1THz away from it. The beam di-
ameter is 130µm. The cavity linewidth is 22kHz, the
medium’s length L = 10−3m, and the transmissivity
10−6. Since a servo-mechanism continuously
T
adapts the dressed cavity resonance to the frequency of
the injected ﬁeld, we assume ¯∆ = 0.

The equilibrium gas temperature, in the absence of col-
lective interaction, is experimentally known with a large
uncertainty. We use an estimated value, ¯T
250µK,
which lies within the range of uncertainty. The sec-
ond crucial parameter which caracterizes the thermalisa-
tion is the damping constant, experimentally evaluated
in Ref. [11] to be γ = 9. We will thus use γ = γc = 9.

old to be displaced towards higher input power values.
Second, the spatial modulation imprinted onto the sam-
ple by the molasses beam, with a wavelength that diﬀers
from that of the collective process (by a factor close to
√2), introduces a competition between two incompatible
length scales. It is likely that this eﬀect should also con-
tribute to raising the critical input power even further.

The detuning value, β, at which the backward ﬁeld
arises (cf. Fig. 3c) also agrees with the observations [11],
which report a red-shift around 100kHz. Moreover, the
continued fraction expansion discussed in the previous
section also allows for a determination of the behavior
of the forward ﬁeld as a function of the input power (cf.
Fig. 3b). Below threshold, PF grows linearly as a func-
tion of the injected power, PI , as no energy is transferred
to the backward ﬁeld. Above threshold, a fraction of the
injected ﬁeld feeds the backward mode, thus leading to a
slower growth of PF .

the detuning between backward and forward ﬁeld, β, as func-
tion of the injected power PI . All quantities are in physical
units. The parameters correspond to those of the experiment
[11].

We ﬁrst report the results of the Fokker-Planck model
since it describes more appropriately the molasses dy-
namics. In Fig. 3a one remarks, from the shape of the
backward ﬁeld power, the existence of a continuous phase
0.2W, com-
transition. The threshold is located at PI ≈
patible with the measurements of Ref. [11], which reports
backward lasing as occurring for a few Watt of injected
power.

The possible underestimate in the threshold value,
which we obtain from our approach, can be attributed
to two experimental features that cannot be taken into
account in a simple way. First, the servo-control which
keeps the cavity on resonance by maximizing the forward
transmitted ﬁeld [11] cannot be correctly modeled by sim-
ply setting ∆ = 0.
Indeed, its operation amounts to
a dynamical process which counteracts the birth of the
backward emission, since the latter removes energy from
the forward ﬁeld. As a result, one expects the thresh-

FIG. 4: Bifurcation diagram numerically computed using the
Vlasov model. Figs.
(a), (b), (c), present respectively the
backward ﬁeld power, PB, the forward ﬁeld power, PF , and
the detuning between backward and forward ﬁeld, β, as func-
tion of the injected power PI . All quantities are in physical
units. The parameters correspond to those of the experiment
[11].

Although one does not expect the Vlasov description
to closely reproduce the experimental results reported in
Ref. [11], it is worth analyzing its predictions; this will
help us clarifying the role of the relaxation mechanisms
and will sharpen our understanding of the problem. From
Fig. 4 one sees that, for the same parameter values used
in the Fokker-Planck approach, the threshold is some-
what lower and the red shift in the backward ﬁeld fre-
quency is smaller as well. Nevertheless, the diﬀerences
are not so dramatic, since, while the threshold occurs for
somewhat lower values of the input power, the frequency
shift shows an even somewhat better agreement with the
observations [11]. In addition, the uncertainty on some
of the experimental parameters is large enough to render
a sure discrimination between the modeling based on a
Vlasov or on a Fokker-Planck process quite diﬃcult. Be-

cause of the intrinsic paradox, given by the inclusion in
the experiment of the optical molasses which ought to
exclude the Vlasov description, this result strongly indi-
cates that the current state of the system’s characteriza-
tion, both experimental and theoretical, is not adequate;
hence, a large amount of caution in drawing conclusions
ought to be exercised.

above threshold is plotted in Fig. 6, where one can in-
deed appreciate the need to account for both the p and
θ dependence in this framework. Nevertheless, one can
compute ρ(θ) by integrating Q(θ, p) (see Eq. (24)). The
results, plotted in Fig. 7, reveal again a qualitative agree-
ment with the Fokker-Planck approach. The larger mod-
ulation for the same input power is a consequence of the
smaller value of the threshold in the Vlasov description.

In addition to the direct comparison to the experiment,
we can also examine some speciﬁc predictions coming

the diﬀerent parts of the ﬁgure correspond to increasing
values of the injected power PI (the other parameters
remaining unchanged). One can clearly see the rise of
the modulation with an increasing role played by higher
harmonics.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

In this paper we have presented a general framework
for the description of the spontaneous appearence of a
stationary density grating arising from the interaction be-
tween an atomic sample enclosed in a bidirectional ring
cavity and an injected, quasi-resonant ﬁeld. This con-
tribution completes the picture previously sketched out
in Refs. [12, 14], where we have shown that the inclu-
sion of a relaxation mechanism for the external degrees
of freedom is indispensable for a correct modeling of the
interaction, and is responsible for the appearence of a
stationary backward ﬁeld. In the previous work, we fo-
cused on the existence of a diﬀerent kind of phase tran-
sition, initiated by a grating in the phase of the atomic
polarization. Here, with the help of a detailed numerical
analysis we have proven beyond doubt, that a true sta-
tionary CARL action – i.e., initiated by the birth of an
atomic density modulation – can spontaneously occur.
For the investigation, we have chosen to study a bidirec-
tional ring cavity model [13, 15] because of the fuller and
more correct description that the latter provides of a real
system. In the course of the presentation, we have shown
that in certain limits the ring cavity model reduces to the
single-pass one [4, 12, 14]; this legitimizes, a posteriori,
the use of the latter approach under such conditions.

Following a discussion of the main relaxation mecha-
nisms that one may expect to ﬁnd in an experiment, we
have oﬀered an analytical description of the two most

likely ones on the basis of a probabilistic description,
in the large detuning limit. Comparison between our
predictions and recent experimental results [11] shows a
semi-quantitative agreement, surprisingly, for both the
Fokker-Planck and the Vlasov approach. Besides the
need for a more accurate experimental characterization
of the phenomenon, including a better determination of
the parameter values, and systematic measurements of
the threshold behavior and of the functional dependence
of the backward ﬁeld power and frequency, additional
theoretical work needs to be completed. In particular, a
more accurate modeling of the relaxation mechanism rep-
resented by the optical molasses needs to be achieved, to-
gether with an analysis of the limits of validity of the de-
scriptions proposed for the losses. Finally, it will be use-
ful to investigate the transtion scenario when two mech-

10

anisms separately described here and in Refs. ([13, 15])
cooperate to induce a backward ﬁeld; this is likely to oc-
cur in the range of smaller detunings when the atomic
variables cannot be eliminated.

safely eliminated by following the procedure described in

[16] For instance, the original model [4], derived under the ap-
proximation of a constant input ﬁeld, does not conserve

[25] The net eﬀect of this randomization is to increase the
threshold value of the injected ﬁeld, because of the dis-
order introduced.

[26] An analogous stability analysis was carried out also in
Ref. [23], where, however, the possible occurence of a
phase transition was missed because of the additional
presence of a probe ﬁeld. In fact, as is the case of ferro-
magnetic systems, the presence of an external ﬁeld de-
stroys the second-order transition.

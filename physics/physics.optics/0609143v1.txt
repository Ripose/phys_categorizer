It is shown that, even when the eigenmodes of an optical cavity are wave-chaotic, the frequency
splitting due to the rotation of the cavity occurs and the frequency diﬀerence is proportional to the
angular velocity although the splitting eigenmodes are still wave-chaotic and do not correspond to
any unidirectionally-rotating waves.

In 1913 Sagnac pointed out that the path length of
the clockwise (CW) propagating light in a rotating ring
interferometer for one round trip is diﬀerent from that
of the counter-clockwise (CCW) propagating light and
hence the Sagnac interferometer can be used as a rotation
rate sensor [1, 2].

The conventional theory of ring laser gyroscopes is
based on the Sagnac’s original idea, that is, the diﬀer-
ence of the path lengths between counter-propagating
lights derived from the special theory of relativity for
ray-dynamical description [1, 2]. More precise electro-
magnetic wave description of the Maxwell equations in-
cluding the eﬀect of rotation is given by the general the-
ory of relativity [1, 2, 3]. These two diﬀerent conventional
ways describing the eﬀect of rotation on the lasing fre-
quency has given the same result because of the following
two assumptions: (i)The ray-wave correspondence of the
cavity-modes; the conventional theory assumes that there
exist closed ring trajectories and the cavity-modes local-
ize on these ring trajectories in a ring resonator. (ii)The
equivalence of the descriptions for the cavity modes by
standing waves and propagating waves; the conventional
theory assumes that the size of the ring resonator is much
larger than the wavelength of the laser, and in this short
wavelength limit the cavity-modes are separated into two
directions propagating along and transversal to the ring
trajectory.

The assumption (ii) means that the cavity-modes
can be always expressed as the unidirectionally rotating
waves and the counter-propagating modes are degener-
ate. Precisely speaking, however, the cavity-modes of
non-rotating cavities are the standing waves as far as the
shape of the cavity does not have a special symmetry like
a circle.

The researches on quantum chaos for these three
decades have shown that there exist so-called wave-
chaotic cavity-modes that do not localize on any ray-
dynamical trajectories due to the chaotic property of the
ray-dynamics in the cavity [4, 5, 6]. The ray-dynamical
description for ring laser gyroscopes is not applicable for
these wave-chaotic cavity-modes. On the other hand, the
wave-dynamical description is still applicable.
In this
Letter, the recently established theory [7, 8] of rotat-
ing resonant microcavities without the assumptions (i)

and (ii) is applied to the cavity which shows the ray-

known that some eigenfunctions in the mixed system lo-
calize on the stable periodic trajectories while others are
wave-chaotic and spread over the chaotic sea in the phase
space. We show that the degenerate eigen-frequency
corresponding to the wave-chaotic cavity-mode of the
non-rotating cavity splits into two frequencies and their
diﬀerence is proportional to the rotation rate although
the splitting cavity-modes are still wave-chaotic and do
not have any corresponding CW and CCW propagating
modes as well as ray-dynamical counterparts, which can-
not be explained by the conventional Sagnac eﬀect.

First let us introduce the ray-dynamical properties and
the wavefunctions of the eigenmodes when the cavity is
not rotating. We will discuss the two-dimensional shape
of the resonant microcavity deﬁned by R(θ) = R0(1 +
ǫ cos 4θ) in the cylindrical coordinates. The parameters
are set as follows: R0 = 6.2866µm, ǫ = 0.04, and the
refractive index n = 1.

Ray-dynamical properties can be easily seen by plot-
ting the trajectories on the Poincar´e surface of the sec-
tion (SOS). It is convenient to use the Birkhoﬀ coordi-
nate (η, s) for SOS, where η is the normalized curvilinear
distance measured along the edge of the cavity from a
certain origin on the edge to the incident point and s is
the sine of the incident angle. The SOS of ray-dynamics
in this cavity shown in Fig. 1 includes stable islands and
a chaotic sea, which shows it is a typical mixed system.

tory, as the ray-motion shown at the top (bottom) of

middle.

The wave properties are discussed only in the case of
TM mode of electromagnetic ﬁeld oscillating as E(r, t) =
(0, 0, ψ(r)e−ickt + c.c.) where c is the velocity of light and
the eigenfrequency ω equals ck, and the Dirichlet bound-
ary condition are imposed for simplicity. By solving the

refractive index inside the cavity, we obtain the eigen-
modes respectively corresponding to the stable islands
and the chaotic sea as shown in Fig. 2 (a) and 3 (a). The

eigenmode in the Husimi representation [9] of Fig. 2 (c)
localizes on both the stable islands of the ring trajecto-
1/√2, which means that the eigenmode in
ries at s =
the non-rotating cavity has both CW and CCW propa-
gating wave components and is standing wave along the
ring trajectory. On the other hand, Fig. 3 (c) shows
that the eigenmode in Fig. 3 (a) does not localize on the
stable islands but is distributed over the chaotic sea. As
well known, no simple ray-wave correspondence exists for
such an eigenmode.

These two modes belong to the same symmetry class
that is respectively even and odd with respect to the
y-axis and the x-axis because the cavity has C4v symme-
try. When these eigenmode are rotated by π/2, one can
obtain the other eigenmodes that are respectively even
and odd with respect to the x-axis and the y-axis. These
modes created by π/2 rotation are orthogonal to the orig-
inal ones. Thus, the pairs of degenerate eigenmodes in
this cavity are obtained as shown in Fig. 2 (b) and 3 (b),
and the Husimi representations of the eigenmodes shown
in Fig. 2 (b) and 3 (b) are shown in Fig. 2 (d) and 3 (d),
respectively.

Next we discuss the eﬀect of rotation of the cavity on
the above eigenmodes. The theory of the eﬀect of the
rotating resonant microcavity on the resonances has re-
cently been obtained [7, 8] and is applicable to the wave-
chaotic eigenmodes where the electric ﬁelds spread over
the whole phase space. Let us brieﬂy review this theory
for the case of the degenerate eigenmodes.

According to the general theory of relativity, the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds in a rotating resonant microcavity are
subject to the Maxwell equations generalized to a non-
inertial frame of reference in uniform rotation with an-

gular velocity vector Ω [1, 2, 3]. By neglecting O(

and assuming the 2D resonant microcavity is perpendic-

By using the perturbation theory for degenerate states
in quantum mechanics, the degenerate eigenmodes ψ0
and ψ1 of the non-rotating cavity are superposed to re-
produce the solutions of Eq. (1) as

ψ± = 1/√2ψ0

Applying this theory to the degenerate eigenmodes
where the electric ﬁelds localize on the ring trajectories
as shown in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b) yields almost the same re-
sults as the conventional theory for ring laser gyroscopes
because the superposition (2) of these degenerate eigen-
modes of the non-rotating cavity produce the split eigen-
modes of the rotating cavity which almost propagate CW

and CCW along the ring trajectories. The eigenmodes
become completely CW and CCW propagating modes in
the short wavelength limit because it has been shown that
the wave functions constructed by the Gaussian beams
unidirectionally propagating along the ring trajectory are
the eigenmodes of the cavity in the short wavelength limit
[10].

However, when we apply this theory to the degener-
ate eigenmodes where the electric ﬁelds are wave-chaotic
as shown in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b), we cannot expect the
superposed solutions (2) are CW and CCW propagating
modes. The cavity-mode ψ0 in Fig. 3(a) can be expressed
by the superposition of the Bessel functions as

ψ0 =

a4m+1J4m+1(nk0r) sin (4m + 1)θ

+

a4m+3J4m+3(nk0r) sin (4m + 3)θ,

because the wave function ψ0 is odd (even) with respect
to x (y)-axis. Then, the expression of the cavity-mode

which has the same eigen-frequency as that of ψ0 and
is even (odd) with respect to x (y)-axis. Accordingly,
we have alternative expressions of the degenerate eigen-
modes (2),

It is important that ψ± should be the eigen-mode of the
rotating cavity, but it contains both CW and CCW prop-
agating waves. Consequently it is impossible to discuss
the diﬀerence of the path lengths between CW and CCW
propagating lights. Nevertheless, the frequency splitting
(3) is still proportional to the angular velocity like the
result from the conventional Sagnac eﬀect. Therefore, it
is concluded that the frequency splitting proportional to
the rotation rate is the more general eﬀect of rotation
of the resonant cavity on its eigenmodes, and only in
the special case that the eigenmodes localize on the ray-
dynamical ring trajectories, this frequency splitting can
be related to the Sagnac eﬀect that is the diﬀerence of
the path lengths between the CW and CCW propagating
modes.

In order to conﬁrm the above conclusion from the per-
turbation theory, we actually solved Eq. (1) numerically
in the rotating cavity with angular velocity Ω, and ob-
tained the eigenmodes, as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5.

Fig. 4 (a) and (b) show the wavefunctions of the eigen-
modes corresponding to the stable island of the ring tra-
jectory in rotating cavity. Then the Husimi representa-
tions of the eigenmodes of Fig. 4 (a) and (b) are shown
in Fig. 4 (c) and (d), and the distribution of the an-

are shown in Fig. 4 (e) and (f), respectively. As seen
in these ﬁgures, the eigenmodes become almost unidirec-
tionally propagating waves along the ring trajectory in
the rotating cavity, while they are the standing waves
along the ring trajectory in non-rotating cavity. Then,
the frequency splitting is proportional to the angular ve-
locity, as shown in Fig. 6, and the scale factor agrees with
that calculated with the diﬀerence of the path lengths of
the ring trajectory. That is, the conventional theory of
the Sagnac eﬀect can be reproduced in this case.

Fig. 5 (a) and (b) show the wave-chaotic eigenmodes,
and the Husimi representations corresponding to each
eigenmodes are shown in Fig. 5 (c) and (d). Unlike

the case where the eigenmodes localize on the stable is-
land, the distributions of the wave-chaotic modes in the
Husimi representations clearly show that the eigenmodes
do not become unidirectionally-propagating modes cor-
responding to the stable islands. Moreover, the angu-
lar momentum spectrum in Fig. 5 (e) and (f) show the
wave-chaotic eigenmodes have both the CW (m < 0)
and CCW (m > 0) propagating wave components even
when the cavity is rotated. However, the eigenfrequency
actually splits into two, and the frequency splitting is
proportional to the angular velocity as shown in Fig. 6.
Thus, one can conﬁrm that the frequency splitting due to
rotation can be observed even on the eigenmodes which
do not split into CW and CCW propagating wave modes.

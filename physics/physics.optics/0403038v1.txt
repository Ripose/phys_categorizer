We analyze a system of globally coupled limit-cycle oscillators, considering the polarization degree
of freedom, and including randomly distributed natural frequencies and oscillation angles. Increasing
the coupling from zero, no polarization order enhancement is possible until the phases start to
synchronize, because the phase disorder destroys the interaction among the polarization variables.
A transition to phase synchrony is found when the coupling overcomes a critical value, and this
transition allows the polarization varibles to interact and synchronize as well. For a given disorder
in the natural frequencies two diﬀerent transitions to synchronization are found. For strong natural
angle disorder, the two transitions to phase and polarization synchronization are well separated,
and we developed an approximated theory to estimate the phase and polarization order parameters.
For weak natural angle disorder, the two transitions merge in a unique process to full synchrony,
and we provided the critical coupling for its onset.

In recent years a considerable interest have been at-
tracted by the self-organization properties exhibited by
the networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators [1]-[2]. The
work of Winfree [3] ﬁrst showed that self-sustained non-
identical oscillators represent a suitable framework to
achieve insight on the synchronization processes in bi-
ological systems. Based on Winfree’s approach, Ku-
ramoto [4] proposed a treatable model successfully ex-
ploited in many ﬁelds, from heart physiology [5] to su-
perconducting junctions [6]. The underlaying idea be-
hind this success is that in many instances the dynamics
of the individual oscillators can eﬀectively by described
as limit cycle oscillator in which only one phase plays a
relevant role. Then, in the limit of small disorder and
weak coupling the Kuramoto typically does a great job.

In the ﬁeld of optics, the cooperative behavior encoun-
tered in laser arrays have been investigated both from
experimental [7, 8] and theoretical [7, 9] points of view
including descriptions in terms of the Kuramoto model
[10] where the global coupling arises from light feedback
from an external mirror. However, the vectorial nature of
the electric ﬁeld imposes a fundamental limitation to the
description of the oscillators in terms of a single phase.
This description can only be used when the polariza-
tion degree of freedom is completely ﬁxed by natural
constrains. This is not the case, for example, in arrays
of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) [11],
where the polarization of the emitted light is not ﬁxed by
the structure [12], and the interplay between polarization
and phase requires at least a description in terms of two

phases for each element [13], as witnessed by recently
developed works in the ﬁeld [14], where phase-coherent
states with inhomogeneous polarization proﬁle have been
found in VCSELs arrays.

In this Letter develop an extension of the Kuramoto
model as a prototype for the description of the fundamen-
tal properties of oscillators associated to vectorial ﬁelds
in which at least two phases play a critical role. One
of the phases is associated to the natural oscillation fre-
quency as in the Kuramoto model, the other is associated
to the polarization orientation. We study the synchro-
nization properties of an ensemble of N globally coupled
non-identical oscillators and show the existance of two
synchronization transitions: one for the phase and the
other for the polarization direction. We develop a self-
consistent theory to determine the thresholds for both
transitions and show that polarization synchronization
can never take place if the system is not already syn-
chronized in phase.

Our analysis is made in the context of a general model,
the Vector Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equation (VC-
GLE), which has been used for modeling diﬀerent physi-
cal systems, from two-components Bose condensates [15]
to non-linear optics [16] and including laser emission from
wide aperture resonators such as VCSELs [13, 17]. The
VCGLE can be written on symmetry grounds, but the
determination of the parameters in the equation requires
a speciﬁc physical model, we consider here parameter
ranges of interest in optics. A set of N globally-coupled
space-independent VCGLEs is given by

where A+
j are the circularly right (left) polar-
ized components of the jth (j = 1 . . . N ) vector vari-
able. The ωj are the natural oscillation frequencies.
The term (γa + iγp) exp(±iδj) represents an external
forcing [17] that couples the two components A+
j and
A−
j of each oscillator. For example, the forcing term
takes a precise meaning when modelling a VCSEL, where
the anisotropies (dichroism and birefringence) [12] of
the semiconductor crystal couple the circularly polarized
components of the electric ﬁeld, introducing two preferen-
tial directions corresponding to the crystallographic axes.
Another example is constituted by the ring laser case: A
localized change in the refraction index breaks the in-
variance symmetry along the ring, introducing the same
kind of coupling between the two counter-propagating
modes [18]. This again reﬂects into preferential phase
relationships between the two waves. In the following,
we consider γj < 1, which is the case of VCSELs [12].
In laser arrays, global coupling may arise from external
reﬂections (e.g. by placing a reﬂection at the common
focus of the array [19]) or may be induced by a common
active medium [14].
We introduce

in Eqs. (1). As γj < 1, linearly polarized states (Q+
j =
Q−
j ) are stable solutions [20] of the solitary oscillators.
Close to these solutions, we neglect the dynamics for
each polarization component amplitude ( ˙Q±
j = 0), so
that the system (1) can be described in terms of phase
equations. This allow us to focus only on the two neu-
tral (zero energy) modes [13] for each oscillator: The
global phase φj = (ϕ+
j )/2, and the rotational phase
ψj = (ϕ+
j − ϕ−
j )/2. Physically, the former determines
the global phase of the electric ﬁeld, wheras the latter
determines the linear polarization direction. We have

In the uncoupled case (C = 0), the global phases φj
rotate at a costant oscillation frequency, whereas the po-
larization angles ψj reach a steady state, thus modeling
a solitary laser emission. In fact, for C = 0 we have two
orthogonal linearly polarized solutions for the jth oscilla-
tor: 2ψj = δj, φj = φ0j + (ωj + γp)t, and 2ψj = δj + π,
φj = φ0j + (ωj − γp)t, where φ0j is a constant. For γa < 0
the ﬁrst solution is stable, and the second unstable while
for γa > 0 is the other way around. In laser physics, the
parameter γa models the diﬀerent gain encountered by
the two linearly polarized solutions, thus making stable

the solution with the higher gain. In the same context,
the parameter γp models the material birefringence [12],
which splits the emission frequency of the two orthog-
onal linearly polarized solutions of an amount equal to
2γp. In the following, we take γa < 0, so we will refer
to 2ψj = δj as to the natural polarization angle of each
oscillator. Our results, however, do not depend on this
choice, neither do on the sign of γp, which we set pos-
itive. Disregarding the polarization degree of freedom
(2ψj(t) = δj = δ0 for all j) equation (4) reverts to the

The natural polarization angles and the natural fre-
quencies represent two sources of disorder in our system.
They are statistical quantities, randomly chosen from two
symmetric unimodal distributions q(δ) and p(ω), with
zero mean and standard deviation σω and σδ, respec-
tively. Therefore, we introduce two diﬀerent order pa-
rameters to characterize the degree of collective synchro-
nization for the polarization and phase variables, respec-
tively

In the uncoupled case (C = 0), as each φj grows linearly
on time with diﬀerent slope (given by ωj +γp), ρ averages
to zero, while as 2ψj = δj, η accounts for the natural dis-
order in the polarization angle. In the continuum limit,

For small coupling the global phases φj are de-
synchronized, and this forces the coupling terms in the
polarization Eqs. (3) to vanish, as shown in Fig. 1. There-
fore each oscillator remains oscillating in its natural po-
larization angle. No polarization interaction is possible
until the phases φj start to synchronize. Increasing C,
two diﬀerent kinds of transition toward full synchrony
(η=ρ=1) are found depending on the relative values of
σδ and σω (i.e. depending on the relative strength of the
polarization and phase desorder, respectively).

For strong natural polarization angles disorder (σω ≪
σδ), the transitions to phase and polarization synchrony
are well separated. The phases φj sinchronize ﬁrst, and
the transition to phase synchrony can be analyzed by
taking 2ψj = δj (frozen polarizations), so that the set
(3)-(4) can be approximated by

Fig. 1 shows the good agreement between the transition
to phase synchronization described by the full set (3)-(4)
and by the solution of (9), with the critical coupling (10).
Since σδ ≫ σω the polarizations spread starts to shrink at
higher coupling levels, with respect to Ct. Therefore, the
assumptions leading to Eq.(8) hold. Increasing further
the coupling strength, the various oscillators leave the
respective natural polarization angles and start to syn-
chronize. As the phase synchronization has already been

3

achieved, we are now in the position to develop a theory
for the polarization synchronization as follows. Assuming
perfect phase synchronization (φk = φj ), Eq. (3) becomes

˙ψj = γa sin(2ψj − δj) +

sin (ψk − ψj) . (11)

From the deﬁnition of the order parameter (5) we have

in Eq. (11), yields

P

˙ψj = γa sin(2ψj − δj) − Cη sin(ψj − χ) .

(12)

Since the individual polarization dynamic is not self-
oscillating, Eq.(12) is not a Kuramoto-like model. How-
ever, we can make use of the order parameter deﬁnition
(5) to self-consistentely solve Eq.(12). The steady state
( ˙ψ=0) of Eq.(12) reads

γa sin(2 ¯ψj − δj) − Cη sin( ¯ψj − χ) = 0 ,

(13)

and provides the stationary value ¯ψj(δ, η, χ) which can
be introduced in Eq. (5) to self-consistently ﬁnd η and χ.
In the continuum limit Eq. (5) reads

η exp(iχ) =

exp(i ¯ψ(δ))q(δ)dδ .

(14)

Z

Therefore, ¯ψ can be explicitly determined from Eqs. (13)-
(14), for example through a Newton-Raphson method.
Altogether, Eqs. (13) and (14) allow for the calculation
of the polarization order parameter, so that the synchro-
nization of the polarization angles can be fully described.
The imaginary part of integral (14) was found to van-
ish (χ = 0), if q(δ) is even. Fig. 1 shows the agree-
ment between the evaluation of η using the deﬁnition
(5) with the results of the numerical integration of the
full set Eqs. (3)-(4) and using the self-consistent approx-
imation Eqs. (13)-(14). We should emphasize that the
ordering of the polarization directions induces a partial
de-synchronization of the phases. The reason is that,
as the polarization order is increased, the polarization
angles depart from the natural angle, and therefore the
term γp cos(2ψj −δj) in Eq. (4) plays the role of an added
disorder to the natural frequencies ωj. Indeed, while syn-
chronizing the polarizations, the system undergoes a loss
of coherence where the phases partially de-synchronize,
lowering ρ. Increasing γp, this eﬀect is increased, enhanc-
ing the coherence loss extent, as shown in Fig. 1. Finally,
for large coupling, phases and polarizations become well
synchronized.

Decreasing the disorder in the natural polarization an-
gles, the polarization transition to synchronization shifts
to lower values of the coupling. However, a polariza-
tion order enhancement is not possible before the phases
start to synchronize, so for σω ∼ σδ and σω > σδ the
two transitions take place simultaneously. Indeed, again
the polarizations are uncoupled until the phases start to

polarizations start to synchronize, as shown in Fig. 2.
Therfore, the transitions can be described similarly as
before by the self-consistent Eq. (8). This gives a good
agreement for the onset of the global synchronization, as
shown in Fig. 2.

In conclusion, we have introduced a theoretical frame-
work to study the synchronization properties of a large
dynamical system of globally coupled oscillators, includ-
ing the polarization degree of freedom. Two sources of

enhancement is possible until the phases start to syn-
chronize, because the phase disorder destroys the interac-
tion among the polarization variables. For strong natural
angle disorder, the phases synchronize ﬁrst, and polar-
ization synchrony takes place at a higher coupling level,
through a partial de-synchronization of the phases (co-
herence lowering). We developed an approximated the-
ory which provides a good estimation of the synchroniza-
tion properties of our system.

Abstract

To simulate VFEL operation the superradiance from a short electron pulse mov-
ing in a volume diﬀraction grating is studied. It is supposed that Bragg condition for
emitted photons is fulﬁlled and dynamical diﬀraction takes place. Spectral-angular
distributions for transmitted and diﬀracted waves are derived. It is shown that the
optimal geometry for superradiance exists and it is determined by the energy and
transverse size of electron beam.

1 Introduction

There are two ways to obtain coherent radiation: for unperturbed electron
beam the coherent radiation appears as a result of bunching of electrons by
ponderromotive wave. The second possibility exists at electron beam modu-
lation or for short electron beam. If the size of electron beam is compared or
less then wavelength l < λ, the intensity of radiation is proportional to N 2,
where N is the number of electrons. As a result intensity of coherent radiation
essentially exceeds the incoherent part (shot noise) in this case. Superradiance
of electron beams was studied in a great number of works (see for example
[1–3]). In present work the spectral-angular distributions of quasi-Cherenkov
radiation in condition of volume distributed feedback for short electron beam
is derived. Volume free electron lasers (VFEL) ([4]) use non-one-dimensional

volume distributed feedback (VDFB), which essentually changes the disper-
sion characteristic of electromagnetic wave and retains radiation in interaction
region. The sharp increase of ampliﬁcation process take place in the points of
degeneration ([5,6]). The spectral-angular behavour of superradiance in these
point are modiﬁed also.

ance

The spectral-angular distribution of radiation is as follows [7]:

Here E(−)
k (ri(t); ω) is the wave function of a photon, which asymptotically
plus incoming spherical wave [7], vi(t) is
behaves as plane wave exp
the velocity of ith electron, ω and k are the frequency and wave vector of
emitted photons. The integration over whole electron pass is performed in (1).
Summing over all electrons in (1) one can obtain the following form-factor of
electron beam:

where ri0 = (ri0⊥, zi0) , rj0 = (rj0⊥, zj0) are the coordinates of electrons at

One can see from (5) that form-factor strongly depends on electron beam
proﬁle. For beam with Gaussian proﬁle the form-factor depends on frequency
steadily. In case of sharp boundary of electron beam form-factor is the oscillat-
ing function of frequency. Substituting (4) and the expression for E(−)
k (ri(t); ω)
in (1) one can obtain the following expression for spectral-angular distribution
of photons in Bragg diﬀraction geometry [7]:

where n is integer, k1z and k2z are the roots of dispersion equation for two wave
dynamical diﬀraction. In these conditions the additional factor (kχL/4π)2

appears in expressions for spectral-angular density. The remarkable property of
points of diﬀraction describing by (10) is the fact that (10) corresponds to max-
imal radiation intensity and maximal value of ampliﬁcation due to stronger
interaction of photons with spartially periodic medium. The same conditions
(9), (10) correspond to more intensive interaction in two wave VFEL ([6])

There are optimal parameteres of diﬀraction geometry, for which the spectral-
angular density of photon in the superradiance process increases. The depen-
dence of form-factor on asymmetry factor β = γ0/γ1 is presented on ﬁg.1.

The optimal geometry is determined by many factors such as electron beam
proﬁle and energy, electrodynamical properties of grating, electron bunch
length and so on.

3 Conclusion

Quasi-Cherenkov superradiance in the volume diﬀraction grating can be ob-
tained at the absence of Cherenkov superradiance, it is possible if:
1) Cherenkov condition for radiation is not fulﬁlled, but quasi-cherenkov con-
dition is satisﬁed [7] or
1, where R
2) cross section of electron beam meets the condition kΘchR
is electron beam radius. Then there is possibility to observe superradiance
at angles lower than Θch for quasi-Cherenkov radiation mechanism due to
equality

one can obtain superradiance at range of Bragg parameteres corresponding to
angles kΘqchR
1 The similarity between quasi-Cherenkov lasing process and
quasi-Cherenkov radiation from short electron beam allows the experimental
simulation of induced radiation in condition of VDFB. For example by using
the volume diﬀraction grating [9] with spatial period of about few milllimeters
we can study the quasi Cherenkov superradiance, to check the dependence of
quasi Cherenkov radiation on parameter β and to observe the spectral angular
diﬀraction anomalies corresponding to (9) and (10) in millimeter wavelength
range. For volume grating with length L = 10 cm the angular and spectral res-
10−3 for observing of diﬀraction anomalies is needed.

We show that the force and torque exerted by light pressure on an irregularly shaped dielectric resonator
allow to detect resonant frequencies, delivering information complemental to the scattering cross-section by
mechanical means. The far-ﬁeld emission pattern of the associated quasi-bound states can be tested by the
angular dependence of the probes at ﬁnite ampliﬁcation rate.

Waves conﬁned in irregularly shaped geometries pose prac-
tical and theoretical challenges, as an intricate interference
pattern arises from the multiple coherent scattering off the
conﬁning boundaries. This is especially true at resonant con-
ditions, when the multiple scattering results in systematic con-
structive interference. Realizations of wave conﬁnement can
be found in the mesoscopic physics of electrons in quantum
dots, and in microscopic dielectric systems, such as micro-
optical lasers made of semiconductors [1], micro-crystals [2],
or laser dye droplets [3] — systems that are promising can-
didates for future electronic and photonic computation and
communication devices. The most direct probes of these sys-
tems are scattering experiments: Quantum dots are attached
to two biased electrodes, and transmission properties are ob-
tained from the conductance. The micro-optical systems are
illuminated with a coherent light source, and the angularly
resolved scattering cross-section is detected. This allows to
determine resonances and, ultimately, helps to infer informa-
tion about the quasi-bound states (found at complex energies
or frequencies), which are the most fundamental theoretical
characteristics of these open systems. The quasi-bound states
can be observed as the working modes of micro-disk lasers,
for which irregular shapes are favored because they permit di-
rected emission [4].

In this paper we discuss a mechanical characterization of
the resonances and the associated quasi-bound states in micro-
scopic dielectric resonators, focusing on the practically most
useful case of irregular but effectively two-dimensional ge-
ometries, and also allowing for a ﬁnite ampliﬁcation rate. The
probes are the force and the torque exerted by light pressure.
Over the past decade, opto-mechanical tools based on light
pressure have found various applications in the manipulation
of microscopic objects, for which usually simple shapes have
been assumed, and precision-detection of the acting forces
have become commonplace [5]. We suggest to use such tools
to analyze the internal wave dynamics in complicated geome-
tries. It turns out that the mechanical response contains in-
formation which is analogous to the scattering cross-section
and the delay time (the conventional probes for resonances),
but is sensitive to other, complemental aspects of the quasi-

bound states. Consequentially, the mechanical probes help to
distinguish between different wave patterns. At ﬁnite ampli-
ﬁcation rate within the medium, they contain information on
the far-ﬁeld emission pattern. Our general argumentation is
supported in a practical setting by numerical computations for
the annularly shaped dielectric disk shown in Fig. 1, which
displays a multifaceted set of wave patterns due to its non-
integrable classical ray dynamics [6, 7]. We use two differ-
ent numerical procedures, the wave-matching method (see e.g.
Ref. [7]) and the boundary element method [8].

Resonances and quasi-bound states: For the effectively
two-dimensional systems in question, we separate the two po-
larizations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, with either the elec-
tric ﬁeld Ez = Re[exp(−iωt)ψ] or the magnetic ﬁeld Bz =
c−1 Re[exp(−iωt)ψ] polarized perpendicular to the plane. In
both cases, the complex wave function ψ fulﬁlls the two-
dimensional Helmholtz equation −∆ψ = n2k2ψ, where n is
the position-dependent refractive index, k = ω/c is the wave
number, and c is the speed of light in vacuum. Ampliﬁcation
is modeled by a complex refractive index with Im n < 0. We
choose a circular region A of radius R > R, containing the
resonator, and decompose the wave function in the exterior of
A in the usual Hankel function basis,

Quasi-bound states are found at complex values kc of k that
permit nontrivial solutions a(out) = ac of the condition of
no incident radiation, a(in) = 0. For the annular resonator,
complex values kc are shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 2,
and some typical wave patterns are presented in the right pan-
els of Fig. 3. For this system, the quasi-bound states occur
with even and odd parity [9], and further can be divided into
whispering-gallery modes at the interior interface (class Wint)
or the exterior interface (class Wext), and extended modes that
we group into two classes A (inside the interior circle, these
modes are of whispering-gallery character) and C (extended
over the whole resonator). Close to resonance in the complex
k-plane (k ≈ k(even)
), the scattering matrix can be ap-
proximated by

where ˜ac,m = (−1)mac,m due to time-reversal symmetry and
we accounted for the potentially quasi-degenerate partner of
opposite parity (indicated by the superscripts).

In general, the quasi-bound states can be transported to real
values of k ≃ Re kc when Im n ≃ Im kc Re n/ Re kc, cor-
responding to an active, amplifying medium close to thresh-
old [10]. Above threshold, the linear relation between a(in)
and a(out) break down, but in homogeneously amplifying
media the lasing modes are well approximated by the cold-
resonator modes [11, 12, 13]. The far-ﬁeld emission pattern
I(φ) = Ic(φ) of the laser is then given by Eq. (2), evaluated
with the quasi-bound state that wins the mode competition.

The values kc are the poles of S where this matrix is singu-
lar, and are reﬂected by resonances of the system at real values
k = Re kc. Conventional probes for resonances are obtained
from the total scattering cross-section

FIG. 2: (Color) The top panels show four quantities as a function of
k that probe for resonances in the annular resonator: The Wigner de-
lay time τW, the angle-of-incidence averaged scattering cross-section
σ0, the angle-of-incidence averaged force in forward direction F0,
and the variance of the torque var N . The lower panel shows the
complex resonance wave numbers kc of quasi-bound states, classi-
ﬁed by their wave patterns as described in the text: Wint (◦), Wext
(△), A ((cid:3)), C (⋄). Open symbols indicate modes of even parity, full
symbols are modes of odd parity. The complex resonances are also
indicated by the spikes in the top panels, located at k = Re kc with
height proportional to the life time 1/(−2c Im kc).

Clearly, the quantities σ and τ depend on the incoming wave,
which we now specify as a plane wave coming from direction
φ0 [15], corresponding to a(in)
m = 1
2 e−im(π/2+φ0). Both σ and
τ then provide angularly resolved information as a function of
φ0. A global characterization of the system is obtained by an
average over the incident radiation direction φ0, giving

where τW is known as the Wigner delay time.

Both the delay time (of predominantly theoretical virtue)
and the (more practical) scattering cross-section display peaks
at resonance, as is illustrated for the annular resonator in the
two topmost graphs of Fig. 2. This indicates a stronger scat-
tering of the light ﬁeld and promises a marked mechanical
response at resonance, which we investigate in the remainder
of this paper.

Kinematics and mechanical detection of resonances: We
ﬁrst provide general kinematic relations for a two-dimensional
resonator in a light ﬁeld, which then will be used to character-
ize resonances and wave patterns. The mechanical forces ex-
erted by the light ﬁeld on a dielectric medium originate from

the refraction and diffraction at the dielectric interfaces — ul-
timately, from the deﬂection (and creation, at ﬁnite ampliﬁca-
tion) of the photons. The kinematics in the combined system
of light ﬁeld and medium can be obtained from the conserva-
tion laws of total angular and linear momentum, which equate
the torque and force acting on the medium to the deﬁcit of
the angular and linear momenta carried by the electromag-
netic ﬁeld into and out of the circular region A. (The center
of this region is identiﬁed with the point of reference for the
torque, and in our example is taken as the center of the exterior
circle.) Note that the conservation laws also hold in an ampli-
fying medium, due to the recoil of each created photon. The
kinematic relations hence follow from integrals of Maxwell’s
stress tensor [16] over the boundary of A. After some alge-
bra, we ﬁnd the time-averaged force and torque (per unit of
thickness of the resonator) in the compact form [17]

In absence of ampliﬁcation and for plane-wave illumination,
it is easily seen that the direction-averaged force and torque

Here, the prime at the sum enforces the restriction n1 + n3 =

Because scattering is enhanced at resonance, we expect
that var N and F0 are global characteristics of the resonances
comparable to σ0 and τW , while N and Fk provide angularly
resolved information as a function of the incident radiation
direction φ0, analogously to σ and τ . Does this promise hold
true?

Figure 2 shows the global characteristics σ0, τW , var N ,
and F0 for the annular resonator as a function of k. The plot
demonstrates a clear correspondence of the resonant peaks in
all four quantities. Evidently, each quantity probes a slightly

FIG. 3:
(Color) The panels (a-d) show results for various com-
binations of k and Im n tuned very close to resonance with the
quasi-bound states of odd parity shown on the right, with (a) kc =
6.009 − i 0.008 (class Wint), (b) kc = 7.554 − i 0.063 (class Wext),
(c) kc = 7.847 − i 0.145 (class C), (d) kc = 9.026 − i 0.022 (class
A). In the top graph of each panel, the angular dependence of the far
ﬁeld I (red) on the radiation direction φ is compared to the angular
dependence on the illumination direction φ0 [15] of the scattering
cross-section σ (green), the weighted delay time τ (blue), and the
x-component of the force, Fx (purple) — the four lines are almost
indistinguishable. In the bottom graph of each panel, the (squared)

different aspect of the resonances, such that their relative
weights are different. As usual, the delay time τW displays
the largest peaks for the very narrow resonances associated to
long-living quasi-bound states. Presently, the longest-living
states are those of class Wint, followed by those of class Wext
and A, while the states of class C are hardly visible here.
The scattering cross-section σ0 displays smaller peaks (some-
times, dips) on a modulated background, and does not provide
a distinctive discrimination between the different states. The

force and torque are sensitive to the wave pattern itself, and
presently display a marked response especially for the quasi-
bound states of class Wext and A (for small k, also for class
C). The torque naturally probes the anisotropy of the internal
wave pattern. All quasi-bound states in Fig. 3 have rather in-
homogeneous internal wave patterns, even though they do not
automatically translate into very anisotropic far-ﬁeld emission
patterns for these rather low values of Re kcR. To which ex-
tent can the far ﬁeld be inferred from the angularly resolved
information contained in σ, τ , N , and F ?

For real k and n,

the φ0-averaged far ﬁeld I0(φ) =
hI(φ)iφ0 is independent of φ. At ﬁnite ampliﬁcation, how-
ever, I0(φ) is modulated, and because of the resonant denom-
inators in Eq. (3) it is inﬂuenced by the quasi-bound states
closest in k. This is illustrated by the results shown in the left
panels of Fig. 3, along with the angular dependence of σ, τ ,
|Fx|, and N on the direction of incident radiation, φ0. The
values of k and Im n are chosen very close to resonance with
the quasi-bound states shown in the right panels. From the
approximation (3) of the scattering matrix one can see that at
exact resonance σ(φ0) ∼ τ (φ0) ∼ |Fx(φ0)| ∼ Ic(φ = φ0),
since none of the quantities vanish for given a(out) = ac [see
Eqs. (4), (5), (8)]. The correspondence of the illumination di-
rection φ0 and the radiation direction φ obviously relies on
the time-reversal symmetry [15], which is incorporated in Eq.
(3) by the relation between ac and ˜ac. Due to the reﬂection
symmetry of the resonator about the x axis, |Fy| ≪ |Fx|
while F|| ≈ cos(φ0)Fx. The symmetry also suppresses N
compared to non-symmetric systems. However, N and Fy
still are enhanced compared to the non-resonant situation.
Let us explain this subtlety for the torque N (the discussion
applies to Fy, as well). For each given quasi-bound state,
m m|ac,m|2 = 0 because of pairwise cancellation of the
terms with opposite m. Still, a non-vanishing result (of order
P
|k−kc|−1) is obtained from the interference between the reso-
nant state (with large coefﬁcients) and the non-resonant states

This relation is indeed obeyed to good extent in the numerical
computations (see Fig. 3). Even at real n, N 2 (the blue curve

I ′2
c . In non-symmetric geometries the sum
for a given quasi-bound state, and hence the proportional-
ity N ∼ Ic (and Fy ∼ Ic) is restored (moreover, quasi-
degeneracies are then lifted, and the system more easily is
tuned to resonance with individual quasi-bound states).

P

In summary, the force and torque exerted by light pressure
on a dielectric resonator allow to detect resonances and help to
characterize the wave patterns of the associated quasi-bound
states. This work concentrated on the wave-optical regime,
in which the wave length is not much smaller than the geo-
metric features of the system, such that internal anisotropies

4

of the wave pattern cannot easily be translated into the far-
ﬁeld emission pattern.
In the case of smaller wave lengths
(large k), where such relations can be formulated in semi-
classical terms, we would expect that directed emission (de-
sired for micro-optical laser) is especially signiﬁed by the
torque, which probes the anisotropy of the internal wave pat-
tern. Moreover, isotropic modes frequently arise from a large
collection of unstable ray trajectories [18], and can be de-
scribed as a superposition of random waves [19]. As k is
increased, more and more random-wave components become
available, and hence the mechanical response is suppressed by
self-averaging. Anisotropic modes are guided by just a few
trajectories such that the self-averaging mechanism does not
apply to them, which further enhances the selectivity of the
torque for anisotropic modes.

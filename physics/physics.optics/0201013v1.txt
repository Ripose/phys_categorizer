Abstract

Tunneling of optical pulses at 1.5 µm wavelength through double-barrier
periodic ﬁber Bragg gratings is experimentally investigated. Tunneling time
measurements as a function of barrier distance show that, far from the res-
onances of the structure, the transit time is paradoxically short, implying
Superluminal propagation, and almost independent of the distance between
the barriers. These results are in agreement with theoretical predictions based
on phase time analysis and also provide an experimental evidence, in the op-
tical context, of the analogous phenomenon expected in Quantum Mechanics
for non-resonant Superluminal tunneling of particles across two successive po-
tential barriers. [Attention is called, in particular, to our last Figure].

I. INTRODUCTION

Tunneling of a particle through a potential barrier is one of the most intriguing phenomena
in quantum mechanics, that continues to attract a great attention both theoretically and experi-
mentally. The reason thereof stems from the fact that some questions related to the dynamics of
tunneling, such as the deﬁnition and measure of tunneling transit times [1–3], have not get a gen-
eral acceptance yet. In addition, tunneling hides some amazing time-domain phenomena, the most
notable one being Superluminal propagation (for related experiments see, e.g., [4,5] and references
therein). In case of opaque barriers, it is known that the tunneling time becomes independent of
the barrier width (Hartman eﬀect [6]; see also [2]) and can become so short to imply apparent
Superluminal motion, which has been the subject of a lively debate in recent years [4,5,7,8]. Since
tunneling time measurements for electrons are usually diﬃcult to achieve and of uncertain inter-
pretation, experimental validation of the Hartman eﬀect and direct measurements of Superluminal
tunneling times have been successfully obtained for the closely-related problem of tunneling of pho-
tons through photonic barriers in a series of famous experiments performed at either microwave
[9,10] and optical wavelengths [11–13].
In particular, in Refs. [11,12] one-dimensional photonic
bandgaps were used as photonic barriers, realizing the optical analogue of electron Bragg scat-
tering in the Kr¨onig-Penney model of solid-state physics. A diﬀerent but related issue is that of
particle tunneling through a double-barrier (DB) potential structure, such as electron tunneling
in semiconductor superlattice structures. In this case, the resonant behavior of tunneling escape
versus energy [14] is a clear manifestation of the wave nature of electrons and is of major impor-
tance for ultrahigh-speed resonant-tunneling devices [15]. Exploiting the analogy between electron
and photon tunneling [16,17], resonant tunneling phenomena have been also studied and observed
in connection with microwave propagation in undersized waveguides and in periodic layered struc-
tures [8,9,18], and general relations have been derived between the traversal time at resonances and
the lifetime of the resonant states [18]. Besides of realizing resonance tunneling, it has been theo-
retically recognized that DB structures are also of interest to study oﬀ-resonance tunneling times
[8,9,18,19]. In this case, for opaque barriers it turns out that the transit time to traverse the DB
structure is independent not only of the barrier width, but even of the length of the intermediate
(classically allowed) region that separates the barriers. So far, measurements of Superluminal tun-
neling in DB structures have been performed by G. Nimtz and coworkers in a series of microwave
transmission experiments [9]; however, no experimental study on oﬀ-resonant tunneling times in
DB photonic structures at optical wavelengths has been reported yet. In recent works [20,21], some
of the present authors have shown that ﬁber Bragg gratings (FBGs) can provide versatile tools for
the study of tunneling phenomena. Besides for their potential relevance in applications to optical
communications, the use of FBGs as photonic barriers is very appealing from an experimental
viewpoint because the tunneling times in FBG structures fall in the tens of picoseconds time scale,
which can be easily and precisely detected by standard optoelectronic means.
In this work we report on measurement of tunneling delay times in DB photonic structures at the
1.5 µm wavelength of optical communications. Our results represent an extension at optical wave-
lenghts of similar experimental achievements previously reported at microwaves [9] and provide a
clear experimental evidence that, for opaque barriers, the traversal time is independent of barrier
distance (generalized Hartman eﬀect). The paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II, the basic model
of tunneling in a DB rectangular FBG is reviewed and the quantum-mechanical analogy of electron
tunneling is outlined. In Sec.III the experimental measurements of tunneling times are presented.

Finally, in Sec.IV the main conclusions are outlined.

II. OPTICAL TUNNELING IN A DB FBG: BASIC EQUATIONS AND
QUANTUM-MECHANICAL ANALOGY

We consider tunneling of optical pulses through a DB photonic structure achieved in a
monomode optical ﬁber by writing onto it two periodic Bragg gratings, each of width L0, sep-
arated by a distance L, which realize a weak modulation of the refractive index n along the ﬁber
axis z according to n(z) = n0 [1 + 2V (z) cos(2πz/Λ)], where n0 is the average refractive index of
the structure, Λ is the Bragg modulation period, and V (z) is proﬁled to simulate a symmetric
rectangular DB structure, i.e. V (z) = V0 constant for 0 < z < L0 and for L + L0 < z < L + 2L0,
and V (z) = 0 otherwise (see Fig.1). For such a structure, Bragg scattering of counterpropagating
c0π/(n0Λ) (c0 is the speed of light in
waves at a frequency ω close to the Bragg resonance ωB ≡
vacuum) occurs in the grating regions, whereas multiple wave interference between the two barriers
leads to Fabry-Perot resonances in the transmission spectrum. The tunneling problem in the DB
FBG structure bears a close connection to that of non-relativistic electrons through a symmet-
ric rectangular DB potential, which has been widely investigated in literature (see, for instance,
[14,22]). The analogy is summarized in Table I, where the basic equations and the expressions
for barrier transmission and group delay are given in the two cases [17,23].
In the electromag-
netic case, a monochromatic ﬁeld E(z, t) at an optical frequency ω close to the Bragg frequency
ωB propagating inside the ﬁber can be written as a superposition of counter-propagating waves,
ikBz) + c.c., where kB = π/Λ is the Bragg

wavenumber; for a small index modulation (V0 ≪

kB = n0(ω

where δ
ωB)/c0 is the detuning parameter between wavenumber k = n0ω/c0
of counterpropagating waves and Bragg wavenumber kB. The wave envelopes u and v are os-
cillatory (propagative) in the region L0 < z < L0 + L, whereas they are exponential (evanes-
cent) inside the gratings when
< kBV0. The spectral transmission of the structure, given by
t(ω) = [u(L)/u(0)]v(L)=0, can be analytically determined by standard transfer matrix methods
[24]. As an estimate of the tunneling time for a wavepacket crossing the structure, we use the
group delay (or phase time) as calculated by the method of stationary phase, which is given by
2 and group delay τ
[25] τ = Im
. A typical behavior of power transmission T =

versus frequency detuning ν = (ω
ωB)/(2π), computed for one of the DB structures used in the
experiments, is shown in Fig.2. Notice that, far from the sharp Fabry-Perot resonances, the group
delay is shorter than that for free propagation from input to output planes, implying Superluminal
propagation. At the center of the bandgap (δ = 0), simple analytical expressions for the power
transmission and group delay can be derived and read:

Equations (3) and (4) clearly show that two distinct contributions are involved in the expression
for the group delay. The former term, τ1, is independent of the barrier separation, and coincides
with the tunneling time of a single barrier of width 2L0. For an opaque barrier (L0V0kB ≫
1),
n0/(c0kBV0) (Hartman
τ1 becomes independent of barrier width and saturates to the value τ1 ∼
eﬀect). Conversely, the latter contribution, τ2, is always shorter than the free-propagation time
over a length L and goes to zero for an opaque barrier, implying that the tunneling time be-
comes independent of barrier distance (generalized Hartman eﬀect). Similar results are obtained
for oﬀ-resonance tunneling of a non-relativistic electron through a rectangular DB potential V (z)
assuming that the incident wavepacket has a below-barrier mean energy E half the barrier width
V0; the corresponding expressions for barrier transmission and group delay in this case are given
in Table I (for details, see, e.g., [22]). The tunneling through a DB FBG structure can hence be
used as an experimental veriﬁable model for the quantum-mechanical case.

4. For such a refractive index modulation, a minimum power transmission T

We performed a series of tunneling time measurements through DB FBG structures operating
at around 1.5 µm in order to assess the independence of the peak pulse transit times with barrier
distance L. The FBGs used for the experiments were manufactured by using standard writing
techniques, with an exposure time to UV laser beam and phase mask length such as to realize a
grating with sharp fall-oﬀ edges of length L0 ≃
8.5 mm and with a refractive index modulation
0.8%
V0 ≃
at antiresonance is achieved for a DB structure, which is low enough to get the opaque barrier
limit but yet large enough to perform time delay measurements at reasonable power levels. The
period of the phase mask was chosen to achieve Bragg resonance at around 1550 nm wavelength.
Five diﬀerent DB structures were realized with grating separation L of 18, 27, 35, 42 and 47 mm.
For such structures, both transmission spectra and group delays were measured using a phase shift
2 pm; an example of measured transmission spectrum
technique [26] with a spectral resolution of
and group delay versus frequency for the 42-mm separation DB FBG is shown in Fig.2. Notice
that, according to the theoretical curve shown in the same ﬁgure, far from the Fabry-Perot reso-
nances the group delay is Superluminal, with expected time advancement of the order of 240–250
ps. Notice also that the sharp Fabry-Perot resonances are not fully resolved in the experimental
curves due to bandwidth limitations (
Direct time-domain measurements of tunneling delay times were performed in transmission ex-
1.3 ns duration, corresponding to a spectral pulse
periments using probing optical pulse with
bandwidth which is less than the frequency separation of Fabry-Perot resonances for all the ﬁve DB
structures. Since both transmission and group delay are slowly varying functions of frequency far
from Fabry-Perot resonances (see Fig.2), weak pulse distortions are thus expected for oﬀ-resonance

pulse transmission. The experimental set-up for delay time measurements is shown in Fig.3. A
pulse train, at a repetition frequency fm = 300 MHz, was generated by external modulation of a
single-frequency continuous-wave tunable laser diode (Santec mod. ECL-200/210), equipped with
100
both a coarse and a ﬁne (thermal) tuning control of frequency emission with a resolution of
MHz. The ﬁber-coupled
10 mW output power emitted by the laser diode was ampliﬁed using a
high-power erbium-doped ﬁber ampliﬁer (IPG Mod. EAD-2-PM; EDFA1 in Fig.3), and then sent
to a LiNbO3-based Mach-Zehnder modulator, sinusoidally driven at a frequency fm = 300 MHz by
a low-noise radio-frequency (RF) synthetizer. The bias point of the modulator and the RF modu-
lation power level were chosen to generate a train with a pulse duration (FWHM) of
1.3 ns; the
measured average output power of the pulse train available for the transmission experiments was
130 mW. The pulse train was sent to the DB FBG through a three-port optical circulator, that
∼
enables both transmitted and reﬂected signals to be simultaneously detected. The signal transmit-
ted through the DB FBG was sent to a low-noise erbium-doped ﬁber ampliﬁer (OptoCom Mod.
OI LNPA; EDFA2 in Fig.3) with a low saturation power (
30 µW at 1550 nm) that maintains
18 mW). In this way, the
the average power level of the output optical signal at a constant level (
power levels transmitted through the DB FBG, for the laser emission tuned either at Fabry-Perot
resonances or anti-resonances of the structure or outside the stopband, were comparable. The
transmitted pulse train was detected in the time domain by a fast sampling oscilloscope (Agilent
Mod. 86100A), with a low jitter noise and an impulsive response of
15 ps; a portion of the sinu-
soidal RF signal that drives the Mach-Zehnder modulator was used as an external trigger for the
oscilloscope, thus providing precise synchronism among successive pulses. Oﬀ-resonance tunneling
was achieved by a careful tuning control of the laser spectrum which was detected by monitoring
the reﬂected signal, available at port three of the optical circulator, using both an optical spec-
trum analyzer (Anritsu Mod. MS9710B) with a resolution of 0.07 nm, and a plane-plane scanning
50 GHz and
Fabry-Perot interferometer (Burleigh Model RC1101R) with a free-spectral range of
a measured ﬁnesse of
180, which permits to resolve the Fabry-Perot resonances of the DB FBG
structures. The reﬂectivity spectrum of the DB FBG was ﬁrst measured by the Fabry-Perot inter-
ferometer and recorded on a digital oscilloscope by disconnecting the laser diode from the input
port of EDFA1 and sending to the DB FBG the broadband ampliﬁed-spontaneous emission signal
of the optical ampliﬁer. This trace is then used as a reference to tune the pulse spectrum at the
center of the oﬀ-resonance plateau between the two central Fabry-Perot resonances of the recorded
DB FBG structure.
Figure 4 shows a typical trace [curve (1)], averaged over 64 acquisitions, of the tunneled optical
pulses under oﬀ-resonance tuning condition, as measured on the sampling oscilloscope, for the 42-
mm separation DB FBG structure, and compared to the corresponding trace [curve (2)] recorded
200 GHz, i.e. far away from the stopband of the DB FBG
when the laser was detuned apart by
structure. A comparison of the two traces clearly shows that tunneled pulses are almost undistorted
248 ps; repeated measurements showed that the measured
with a peak pulse advancement of
15 ps, the main uncertainty in the measure being
pulse peak advancement is accurate within
determined by the achievement of the optimal tuning condition. We checked that propagation
through EDFA2 does not introduce any appreciable pulse distortion nor any measurable time de-
lay dependence on the ampliﬁcation level. Time delay measurements were repeated for the ﬁve
DB FBG structures, and the experimental results are summarized in Fig.5 and compared with the
theoretical predictions of tunneling time as given by Eqs.(3) and (4). The dashed line in the ﬁgure
shows the theoretical transit time, from input (z = 0) to output (z = 2L0 +L) planes, versus barrier

separation L for pulses tuned far away from the bandgap of FBG; in this case, the transit time is
given merely by the time spent by a pulse traveling along the ﬁber for a distance L + 2L0 with a
velocity c0/n0. The solid line is, in turn, the expected transit time for oﬀ-resonance tunneling of
pulses, according to the phase time analysis [see Eqs.(3) and (4)]], which shows that the transit time
does not substantially increase as the barrier separation is increased (generalized Hartman eﬀect).
The points in the ﬁgure are obtained by subtracting to the dashed curve the measured pulse peak
advancements for the ﬁve DB FBGs, thus providing an experimental estimate of the tunneling
transit time. Notice that, within the experimental errors, the agreement between measured and
predicted transit times is rather satisfactory. For each of the ﬁve DB FBG structures, the measured
transit times are Superluminal; it is remarkable that, for the longest barrier separation used, the
transit time leads to a Superluminal velocity of about 5c0, the largest one measured in tunneling
experiments at optical wavelengths [27]. These paradoxically small transit times do not represent,
however, a genuine violation of Einstein causality [4,11,12], and may be qualitatively explained
as the result of two simultaneous eﬀects that are a signature of the wave nature of the tunneling
processes [28]. On the one hand, following Refs. [2,11,12], peak pulse advancement occurs at each
of the two barriers as a result of a reshaping phenomenon in which the trailing edge of the pulse is
preferentially attenuated than the leading one; on the other hand, the independence of tunneling
time on the barrier distance can be explained, following Ref. [19], as an eﬀective “acceleration” of
the forward traveling waves in the intermediate classically-allowed region that arises in consequence
of the destructive interference between the two barriers.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper oﬀ-resonant tunneling of optical pulses has been experimentally investigated in
ﬁber Bragg photonic barriers. Tunneling time measurements have been shown to be in good agree-
ment with theoretical predictions based on phase time analysis and have unambiguously conﬁrmed
that, for opaque barriers, the tunneling time is independent not only of the barrier width, as pre-
viously shown in Ref. [12], but even of the barrier separation. Our results extend to the optical
region previous experimental achievements performed at microwaves [9] and may be of interest in
the ﬁeld of optical tunneling and related issue of Superluminal propagation.

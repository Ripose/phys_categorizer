Abstract

The starting point of the article is the puzzling fact that one cannot recover

the Fresnel coeﬃcients by letting tend the width of a slab to inﬁnity. Without

using the so-called limiting absorption principle, we show by a convenient

limit analysis that it is possible to deﬁne rigorously the ﬁeld diﬀracted by a

semi-inﬁnite periodic medium.

I. INTRODUCTION

Over the past decades, the numerical resolution of Maxwell equations has made out-
standing advances, thanks to the various rigourous methods developed to solve them. One
may think for instance, in the theory of gratings, of the integral method, the diﬀerential
method or the method of ﬁctitious sources. The tremendous progress of computer capaci-
ties has been equally important. Generally speaking, it seems that we now have very eﬃcient
tools to solve any diﬀraction problem (the 3D is merely a problem of computer power, and
not a theoretical one). Nevertheless, quoting R. Thom, the famous mathematician, Field
medalist and inventor of Catastrophe Theory, ”predicting is not explaining”. And although
we are able to compute almost everything, we cannot explain much. This paper points out
that a simple problem, here a one dimensional one, may lead to deep questions and some-
what interesting answers. Our starting point is a basic remark concerning diopters. The
diﬀraction of a plane wave, in normal incidence, by a diopter separating the vacuum from a
homogeneous medium of optical index ν gives rise to Fresnel coeﬃcients as is well known.

This is indeed a fundamental result, commonly used by the opticists. Unfortunately
diopters do not exist and, consequently, the famous Fresnel coeﬃcients should not exist
either. The problem may be formulated in the following way: let us consider a slab of index
ν and width h. This gives rise to a reﬂection coeﬃcient rh. A natural question is: do we
get r when letting h tend to inﬁnity in rh? When we consider a lossless material (ν is
therefore real), the answer is no, obviously. So, how can one measure Fresnel coeﬃcients
as there is no such thing as a semi-inﬁnite medium in practice ? Two kinds of answers are
generally put forward. The ﬁrst answer that seems to come naturally to many is to evoke
the absorption, and the fact that transparent media do not exist. Let us say that it is a
poor answer. Indeed, consider for instance the diﬀraction of a beam, in optical range, by a
homogeneous layer (for example, silice for which the refractive index is ν = 1.47 + i10−5),
let’s say of a few millimeters (namely the substrate). We can hardly say that there is any
absorption in that case. But we have here a medium that is almost thousand wavelengths
wide. Another way out generally put forward is to evoque coherence length. This argument
is probably correct for the natural light for which coherence length is about micrometer,
i.e.
less than the depth of materials commonly used in optics (See [1] for an exhaustive
review on this subject). However for a beam whose coherence length is greater than a few
millimeters one has to ﬁnd another explanation (it is the case for He-Ne laser beam, for
which coherence length is about 20 cm). Without using the two above quoted arguments,
we propose a rigorous answer to this problem, in the more general case of a semi-inﬁnite
periodic medium. More precisely, we show that it is possible to deﬁne the ﬁeld reﬂected
by a semi-inﬁnite periodic medium. We demonstrate that there is no need to use the so-
called limiting absorption principle nor to use explicitly the notion of coherence length. We
proceed in two stages. First, we study the diﬀraction of a plane wave by a ﬁnite medium.
In this case, the diﬀracted ﬁeld is characterized by a reﬂection coeﬃcient. In a second stage,
we study the limit behavior of the reﬂection coeﬃcient as the width of the medium tends to
inﬁnity. All the ﬁelds that we consider are z-independent and therefore we may reduce the
diﬀraction problem to the basic cases of polarization: E// (electric ﬁeld parallel to z) and
H// (magnetic ﬁeld parallel to z).

II. REFLECTION BY A FINITE ONE-DIMENSIONAL MEDIUM

We consider a one dimensional structure made of N identical layers (See [2]). A layer
is characterized by its relative permittivity ε (x), which is assumed to be real and positive.
For convenience up to the section 4 included, the thickness of a layer is equal to 1. The
structure is illuminated by a wavepacket of the following form:

U i(x, y, t) =

A(k, θ) exp(ik(cos θx + sin θy)) exp(−iωt)dµ ,

where µ is some measure over the set P of parameters (k, θ):

Explicit forms of µ will be given in section 4. By means of Fourier analysis, the diﬀraction
of such a wavepacket by a ﬁnite structure may be reduced to the study of the diﬀraction of
a plane wave, which we develop in the following paragraph.

We consider a plane wave of wave vector k0 illuminating the structure under the incidence
θ ( k0 is assumed to belong to the (xOy) plane, we denote β0 = k0 cos θ). The total ﬁeld
is described by a single variable function UN (x). When the electric ﬁeld is parallel to the
z-axis (E// case) UN (x) exp(ik0y sin θ) represents the z-component of the electric ﬁeld and
when the magnetic ﬁeld is parallel to the z-axis (H// case), it represents the z-component
1/2 , the total ﬁeld UN veriﬁes the
of magnetic ﬁeld . Denoting: β (x) = k0

with: q ≡ 1 for E// polarization, q ≡ ε for H// polarization. Let χ1 and χ2 be the solutions
of equation (4) verifying

The fundamental matrix of the system is then

and the resolvent matrix is:

χ1 (0) = 1, χ′
χ2 (0) = 0, χ′

R(x, y) = V (y)V −1(x)

It is the matrix linking the value of one solution at point x to its value at point y. The
monodromy matrix is ﬁnally deﬁned as:

T = R(0, 1) =

χ1(1) χ2(1)

2(1)

(cid:18)
This matrix characterizes a layer as it allows the writing of the matching between the
boundary conditions. Indeed, taking into account the propagation conditions (5), we derive
the following relation:

which permits to obtain both values of rN and tN . When dealing with a wavepacket, we

rN (k, θ) exp(ik(− cos θx + sin θy)) exp(−iωt)dµ .

Our aim is now to study the limit behavior of rN as N tends to inﬁnity.

A. Some properties of matrix T. Connection with Bloch wave theory

The determinant of matrix T is the value of the wronskian of solutions w1 and w2 at
point 1. As in that case the wronskian is constant, it is equal to 1. Consequently, T is a
unimodular matrix and its characteristic polynomial is X 2 − tr (T) X + 1. Therefore the
eigenvalues of T are real if and only if 1
2 |tr(T)| > 1. This suggests a splitting of the set of
parameters:

G =
B =
∆ =

(k, θ) ∈ P, 1
(k, θ) ∈ P, 1
(k, θ) ∈ P, 1

2 |tr(T)| > 1
2 |tr(T)| < 1
2 |tr(T)| = 1

(cid:8)
(cid:8)
(cid:8)

(cid:9)
(cid:9)
(cid:9)

When (k, θ) ∈ B, the eigenvalues of T are conjugate complex numbers of modulus 1,

whereas when (k, θ) ∈ G, T has two real eigenvalues γ (k, θ) ,

where, by conven-

1
γ (k, θ)

tion, |γ (k, θ)| < 1. If (k, θ) ∈ ∆, then T has an eigenvalue γ (k, θ) of multiplicity 2 with
either γ (k, θ) = 1 or γ (k, θ) = −1. We denote by ∆0 the subset of ∆ where T or −T is
the identity matrix.

Bloch wave theory is the convenient tool when dealing with propagation equations with
periodic coeﬃcients. Given a periodic medium with period Y , it consists in searching solu-

−→
k belongs to the so-called ﬁrst Brillouin zone Y ′. For one-dimensional
periodic function and
media, with period Y = [0, 1[, the theory is quite simple, for in that case Y ′ = [−π, +π[.
Therefore, Bloch solutions write vφ (x) = uφ (x) eiφx, where the so-called Bloch frequency
φ belongs to Y ′, and uφ (x + 1) = uφ (x). Thus we have vφ (x + 1) = eiφvφ (x). From the
deﬁnition of T this means that eiφ is an eigenvalue of T, and the above remarks shows that
tr(T) = 2 cos φ, which provides us with the dispersion relation of the medium and leads us
to deﬁne φ a function on B by:

(8)

Obviously, for couples (k, θ) belonging to B, it is possible to deﬁne a Bloch frequency φ,
and therefore there exists propagating waves in the medium: such couples (k, θ) thus deﬁne
a conduction band. If (k, θ) belongs to G then there are only evanescent waves and (k, θ)
belongs to a forbidden band.

B. Explicit expression of the reﬂection coeﬃcient

We suppose that (k, θ) belongs to P\∆. Denoting (v, w) a basis of eigenvectors of T we
write in the canonical basis of R2 : v = (v1, v2) , w = (w1, w2) . Eigenvector v (resp. w) is
associated to eigenvalue γ (k, θ) (resp. γ−1 (k, θ)). It is of course always possible to choose
(v, w) such that det (v, w) = 1. After tedious but easy calculations, we get rN in closed
form from (6):

g (k, θ) = q (v) , f (k, θ) = q (w) if |q (v)| < |q (w)|
g (k, θ) = q (w) , f (k, θ) = q (v) if |q (w)| < |q (v)|

Remark: We have |g| < |f | and in a conduction band f = g−1 so that we always have
|g (k, θ)| ≤ 1.

Let us denote ﬁnally denote:

We immediately see that the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients are obtained through

III. ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS OF THE REFLECTION COEFFICIENT

The reﬂection coeﬃcient deﬁnes a sequence of points belonging to the closed unit disc D
of the complex plane. In order to have a clear understanding of the behavior of {rN , tN }, we
interpret this sequence as a discrete dynamical system. As N increases, we want to study
how the orbits of this system spread over D.

When (k, θ) belongs to G ∪ (∆ \ ∆0) the behavior of the dynamical system is trivial
as {rN , tN } admits one cluster point, situated on U = {̥, |̥| = 1}. Indeed, in that case γ
belongs to R\ {−1, 1}. Recalling that by convention |γ| < 1, we see that Hr
tends
to g (k, θ). As the eigenvectors of T are real, we conclude that g (k, θ) belongs to U. The
second easy case is for (k, θ) belonging to ∆0, indeed {rN , tN } is constant and equal to 0
whatever N.

bands, i.e.
In the
following we will skip the mathematical rigor and stress on the physical meaning of the
results. The interested reader will ﬁnd a complete and rigorous mathematical discussion in
[3].

Dealing with a couple (k, θ) belonging to B, the eigenvalues of T now belong to U and
has no pointwise limit as N tends to

inﬁnity. From a geometrical point of view, it is easy to show that the image of U through
H is a circle V (k, θ) passing through the origin and whose cartesian equation writes:

(x − ℜe{z0})2 + (y − ℑm{z0})2 = |z0|2

, with z0 = (f −1 + g−1)−1

(13)

Therefore, {rN , tN } describes a set of point on V (k, θ). As {rN , tN } does not converge
pointwise, we turn to another notion of convergence, in some average meaning. An easy
computation in the case |g(k, θ)| < |f (k, θ)|, shows that

We want to pass to the limit N → +∞ in the preceding expressions. What we expect is
some averaging over the set Y ′. Clearly, the limit behavior relies on the properties of µ and
φ. Let us deﬁne a convenient class of measures. Denoting C# (Y ′) the space of continuous
Y ′-periodic functions, we put:

Deﬁnition 2: A measure µ is said admissible, if exp (iNφ (k, θ)) tends weakly to 0.
Of course, this looks like an ad hoc property as it allows to get directly the limits of
interest, but indeed this is a correct way of handling the problem, as it can be shown that
the measures of interest for our problem, i.e. that of physical signiﬁcance, will prove to be
admissible. From the above expression, we conclude that

tN tends weakly to 0.

IV. DIFFRACTION OF A WAVEPACKET BY A SEMI-INFINITE MEDIUM

Now, let us choose the incident ﬁeld as a wavepacket of the form (2) where µ is of one

of the following forms:

I : µ = p(k, θ)dk ⊗ dθ, p ∈ L1(P, dk ⊗ dθ)
II : µ = p(θ)δk ⊗ dθ, p ∈ L1(
, dθ)
III : µ = p(k)dk ⊗ δθ, p ∈ L1(R+, dk ⊗ δθ)

(cid:3)

(cid:2)

These measures deﬁne the most commonly used incident ﬁelds. Indeed measures of type I
correspond to a general wavepacket, measures of type II to a monochromatic beam, and
measures of type III to a temporal pulse. In order to apply the above results we have the
following fundamental result:

Proposition 2: Measures of type I, II, III are admissible.
We can conclude that, for these measures µ, the diﬀracted ﬁeld U d

to N layers converges uniformly towards U d

∞(x, y, t) given by:

N (x, y, t) corresponding

U d

∞(x, y, t) =

r∞(k, θ) exp(ik(sin θx + cos θy)) exp(−iωt)dµ

That way, we have obtained a rigorous formulation for the diﬀraction of a wavepacket by a
semi-inﬁnite medium.

V. REFLECTION OF A MONOCHROMATIC BEAM BY A LOSSLESS SLAB OF
INFINITE THICKNESS

A very special and interesting case is the case of a simple slab of optical index ν: the

reﬂection coeﬃcient (rh) is therefore well known :

where rdio is the reﬂection coeﬃcient for the diopter (rdio =
with a lossy material N is therefore element of C − {R, iR}, and in that case:

). When the slab is ﬁlled

β0 − β
β0 + β

rh = rdio(

1 − exp2iβh

1 − r2

dio exp2iβh )

∀(k0, θ) ∈ P, rh −→ rdio

On the contrary, when we are dealing with lossless materials, ν is real.
In that case, rh
has an oscillating behavior and does not converge (and a fortiori does not converge to rdio).
However, if we consider a limited monochromatic incident beam described by a function
uinc(x, y) :

where p(α) ∈ L1(] − k0, k0[, dα) and characterizes the shape of the incident beam. We are
therefore in the case where the measure µ is of the form II (cf. paragraph V) i.e. :

with p ∈ L1(] − π/2, π/2[, dθ). In these conditions the diﬀracted (reﬂected) ﬁeld uh(x, y)
corresponding to a slab of ﬁnite thickness h follows as such :

uh(x, y) =

rh(α)p(α)ei(−αx+β(α)y) dα

and the diﬀracted ﬁeld udio(x, y) corresponding to the diopter :

udio(x, y) =

rdioh(α)p(α)ei(−αx+β(α)y) dα

It is very easy to calculate the reﬂection coeﬃcient r∞ in that case. The monodromy matrix
is:

(cid:18)
therefore every (k, θ) belongs
so that
arccos(1/2T r(T)) = βh. After elementary calculations we ﬁnd :

f = (

Taking everything into account, we ﬁnd the weak convergence r∞ = rdio and therefore
uh −→ udio.

VI. ELECTROMAGNETIC PEROT FABRY

In numerous experiments in Optics it appears that the light concentrates round particular
areas of the overall space, namely the rays. In this paragraph, we establish a link between
the amplitude associated with a ray and the amplitude associated with the electric ﬁeld.

A. Simple Perot Fabry

It is well known that many reﬂected rays appear when dealing with the reﬂection coef-
ﬁcient of a monochromatic beam by a “simple” Perot-Fabry, we are in the same case as in
the precedent paragraph, for wich the reﬂected ﬁeld corresponding to the ﬁnite thickness
slab uh(x, y)writes as follows:

uh(x, y) =

rh(α)p(α)ei(−αx+β(α)y) dα

¿From equation (17), the reﬂection coeﬃcient rhcan be expressed as a series in the following
manner:

Consequently, uhcan also be expressed as a series (the exponential decreasing of rdio allows
us to reverse the signs

Each function uh,l , l ∈ {0, · · · , +∞} is interpreted as the complex amplitude associated

with a ray labeled by l (cf. ﬁgure 1):

• the term r2l−1

dio t12t12 corresponds to the amplitude associated with a ray l.

• the term e2iβ(α)hl corresponds to a term of phase which expresses the delay of the

reﬂected ray l with respect to the ﬁrst reﬂected ray (l = 0)

• the minus sign before the integral may appear as suspicious. However, for the opticist,
the interpretation of this sign is easy. The reﬂection of all rays are of the same nature
(reﬂection of a ray from a medium of index ν on a medium of index 1) except for the
ﬁrst ray (reﬂection of a ray from a medium of index 1 on a medium of index ν), which
implies a change of sign in the reﬂection coeﬃcient.

Besides, expression (28) calls for two remarks :

1. the optical interpretation of functions uh,l is all the more clear as the following condi-
tions are better fulﬁlled: a) the supports of the rays l are actually separated, i.e. the
function p has a narrow support , b) the incident ﬁeld is suﬃciently slanted and c) the
depth of the slab is suﬃciently large with respect to the wavelength.

2. in the precedent paragraph, we have shown that uh tends to udio as h tends to inﬁnity,
consequently the series in equation (28) has to tend to zero when h tends to inﬁnity.
Therefore, each function uh,l behaves as a corrector for the diﬀracted ﬁeld (each ray
except the ﬁrst one does vanish when the depth of the slab tends to inﬁnity).

B. Generalized Perot Fabry

We consider now a one dimensional structure made of N identical layers. Writing uN (x, y)

the ﬁeld diﬀracted by this structure, we have:

Using the expression of rN in (7) and the same techniques used above, we ﬁnd :

uN (x, y) =

C. Speed of convergence : numerical experiments

Up to now a special attention has been drawn about theoretical aspects of electromagnetic
diﬀraction. More precisely, we have proved that, in any case encountered in physics, the
function uN (x, y, t) which represents the diﬀracted ﬁeld converges to a function u∞(x, y, t)
which one can easily calculate. But it remains to be seen how the function uN (x, y, t)
converges to its limit. For instance, in harmonic regime with a pulsatance ω, it is of practical
prime importance to know the number of layers Nη from which one can replace, with a given
precision η, uN (x, y, ω) by u∞(x, y, ω). From a theoretical point of view, it is very diﬃcult
to answer such questions even if , in some respects, we outlined an answer in the precedent
paragraph. We are thus “doomed” to make numerical experiments and to leave the general
insights of the Theory. Of course, in this paragraph, we do not aspire to the exhaustiveness
and we only aim at giving some rough estimates.

VII. CONCLUSION

What is classical Optics (or coherent Optics)? Since Maxwell, at the end of the nineteenth
century, the answer seems to be easy: classical optics is the study of the diﬀraction of an
electromagnetic ﬁeld by a body whose size is very large compared with the wavelength
(mean wavelength). That means that we have to consider classical optics as a limit for
small wavelengths of electromagnetic optics. Unlike the doxa, we consider that this limit
is far from being clear. For instance, it is well known that in electromagnetic optics, the
diﬀracted ﬁeld is very sensitive to the polarization of the incident ﬁeld. On the contrary,
for small wavelengths, in a lot of applications, the diﬀracted ﬁeld is independent of the
polarization. In many cases, this remarkable property remains mysterious. In this paper, we
only dealt with one dimensional problem and we demonstrated that the limit analysis (the
path from the electromagnetic problem to the optical one) is generally ill posed for a plane
wave (Fortunately, this case does not exist!) but is well posed for the cases encountered in
physics. Besides, the limit analysis that we have given above does not take into account
the roughness of the layers. For the sake of simplicity, we did not think ﬁt to describe
in a realistic way the process of measuring the ﬁeld: this would have lead us to use a
spatial convolution process. These remarks are not at all limitations of our study. On
the contrary, both these phenomena would have improved the convergence of the involved
sequences. Nevertheless we do think that this Limit Analysis is far more fundamental
for a good understanding of classical optics than the usual explanations.Take the case of
spectacles, which are usually intended to improve the vision. Can one be satisﬁed by such

11

an explanation as that involving absorption? The challenge is now to extend these results to
the bidimensional or even tridimensional case, for which the very mathematical formulation
itself is far from being clear.

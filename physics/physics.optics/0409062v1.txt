Abstract. The rate of linear collisionless damping (Landau damping) in a
classical electron gas conﬁned to a heated ionized thin ﬁlm is calculated. The
general expression for the imaginary part of the dielectric tensor in terms of the
parameters of the single-particle self-consistent electron potential is obtained. For
the case of a deep rectangular well, it is explicitly calculated as a function of the
electron temperature in the two limiting cases of specular and diﬀuse reﬂection
of the electrons from the boundary of the self-consistent potential. For realistic
experimental parameters, the contribution of Landau damping to the heating of
the electron subsystem is estimated. It is shown that for ﬁlms with a thickness
below about 100 nm and for moderate laser intensities it may be comparable with
or even dominate over electron-ion collisions and inner ionization.

Landau damping in thin ﬁlms irradiated by a strong laser ﬁeld

2

1. Introduction

The interaction of strong laser ﬁelds with nanobodies such as clusters and thin ﬁlms has
become a subject of wide interest over the last decade. A very signiﬁcant distinguishing
feature of clusters and thin ﬁlms irradiated by a strong laser ﬁeld as compared with
a gas of isolated atoms and even with solids and plasmas is the very eﬃcient energy
transfer per atom from the laser ﬁeld to the respective matter [1]. The high eﬃciency
of energy absorption in nanobodies produces fast heating of their electron subsystem
up to temperatures on the keV scale and leads to the occurrence of many interesting
new phenomena such as Coulomb explosion of clusters, production of ions with very
high charges, x-ray emission from cluster targets and ﬁlms, to name a few. Therefore,
the mechanisms of energy absorption by the electron subsystem in nanobodies are
of primary interest and importance for understanding many aspects in strong-ﬁeld
nanophysics.

The physics of laser-irradiated nanostructures including clusters and thin ﬁlms
have been reviewed recently [2, 3, 4]. Various models of the energy absorption from a
laser pulse were discussed. In the nanoplasma model [1, 5], which is meant to describe
clusters irradiated by a strong laser ﬁeld with intensities of 1015–1018 W/cm2, the
imaginary part of the dielectric constant ε = ε′ + iε′′ is supposed to be the result
of individual electron-ion collisions like in an inﬁnite plasma, so that ε′′ = 2νei/ω.
Here νei is the frequency of electron-ion collisions and ω the laser frequency.
In a
plasma with parameters typical for intense-laser–cluster interaction, the time between
individual collisions is around 10–100 fs. For laser pulses of moderate intensity (1013–
1014 W/cm2), as they are used in studies of the optical breakdown in dielectrics (see
[6, 8, 7] and references therein), electron-phonon collisions give a relaxation time on
the picosecond scale.

Another eﬃcient mechanism of energy absorption is vacuum heating [9]. However,
it is relevant only for a not too thin plasma and for high laser intensities when the
conditions a > x0 > l are satisﬁed, where a is the thickness of the plasma, x0 the
amplitude of the electron oscillations under the action of the laser ﬁeld, and l the size
of the skin layer. For the parameters considered here, namely ﬁlms with a thickness
a
100 nm and moderate laser intensities, the relation between a, x0 and l is rather
the other way around, so that the mechanism of vacuum heating is irrelevant.

≤

Finally, laser energy may be absorbed in electron collisions with the conﬁning
surface. This eﬀect can be interpreted as collisionless damping, or Landau damping,
in a spatially restricted plasma. Such a mechanism of energy transfer in various
multiparticle systems from collective into individual-particle degrees of freedom was
ﬁrst considered for longitudinal waves in a quasi-neutral inﬁnite plasma [10, 11]. For a
ﬁnite system, Landau damping was studied for the ﬁrst time in 1966 [12] for a collection
of cold ﬁne metallic particles, assuming an external ﬁeld weak enough to leave the
electron gas at zero temperature. In a cold spherical nanoplasma, the imaginary part
of the dielectric constant produced by Landau damping has the form

(1)

where vF is the Fermi velocity, a the spatial size of the system (e.g. a = R for
a spherical cluster), and the dimensionless function C(ω) depends on the boundary
conditions for the electrons and on the geometry of the system. A detailed discussion
of Landau damping in cold metal clusters including an analysis of the role of boundary
conditions for the electrons and a comparison with experimental data may be found

in references [13, 14, 15]. For cold particles with radii below 100 nm, collisionless
ε∞, so that the
damping dominates over collisions with phonons [14], viz. εL ≫
absorptive part (1) determines the cross sections of light scattering and absorption by
a small nanobody with a cold degenerate electron subsystem.

For nanostructures interacting with a strong laser ﬁeld, the state of the electron
gas diﬀers signiﬁcantly from that in cold clusters: ﬁrst, the electron gas is heated to
a temperature on the keV scale, so that the electron plasma becomes purely classical;
second, a nanobody irradiated by a strong ﬁeld becomes partially ionized so that the
self-consistent electron potential may diﬀer considerably from the rectangular well
used for the description of cold particles [12, 13, 15]. However, the contribution of
Landau damping to absorption remains substantial [16, 17, 18].
In particular, it
deﬁnes the amplitude of the electric ﬁeld inside a cluster near the Mie resonance
[17]. The latter may become particularly important, when it is nonlinearly excited.
This was recently proposed theoretically [19, 20] and observed experimentally [21] in
laser-irradiated clusters. In references [17, 19], the width of the Mie resonance was
estimated assuming that the frequency of electron collisions with the boundary is

νL ≃

v
R

,

(2)

where v is the thermal or eﬀective electron velocity. This crude estimate yields for the
imaginary part of the dielectric constant the expression (1) with the eﬀective velocity
and C = 2. Obviously, it does not take into account the shape of
v in place of vF†
the self-consistent potential whereby the electrons are trapped nor the shape of the
thermal distribution function. Therefore, the eﬀect of Landau damping in a heated
classical nanoplasma is still lacking a quantitative treatment.

In the present work, we calculate for the ﬁrst time the contribution to the dielectric
tensor from collisionless damping in the heated electron plasma trapped inside an
ionized laser-irradiated one-dimensional (1D) thin ﬁlm. The plasma is supposed to be
classical, so that this contribution does not depend on Planck’s constant. As we shall
show, in a classical ﬁnite system the simple form (2) is only realized under speciﬁc
conditions. In general, the behavior of the imaginary part εL of the dielectric tensor
is quite complicated and depends on the shape of the self-consistent single-particle
electron potential and on the speciﬁc boundary conditions. Its numerical value can
be substantial, so that this mechanism may be dominant in the process of electron
plasma heating. Some preliminary results of this work were annonced in [22].

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we state the problem and
obtain the general expressions for the rate of collisionless energy absorption and for
the dielectric tensor εik(ω) in a homogeneous isotropic thin ﬁlm. The case of diﬀuse
reﬂection of electrons from the boundary of the self-consistent potential is considered
in the third section. The fourth section contains the application of the results obtained
to the description of laser light absorption in a thin ﬁlm. Details of the calculations
are delegated to appendixes A and B.

2. Statement of the problem and general expression for the dielectric
tensor in a thin ﬁlm

Let us consider a one-dimensional

concentrated mainly within this ion layer. As a result of the partial evaporation of the
electrons, the system has some nonzero positive charge and produces a self-consistent
static electric potential U (z), which traps the residual electrons. We treat the ionic
subsystem as frozen, which usually is a valid assumption on the femtosecond time
scale

because the equilibrium electron distribution n0

deﬁnition of these two functions, equation (3) must be solved simultaneously with the
Boltzmann equation for an electron plasma. Here, we do not consider this problem
and take the self-consistent potential as a given function.

Oscillations of the electron cloud in such a system arise either due to the action
of the external laser ﬁeld or due to a small deviation of the electron cloud from its
equilibrium position. We suppose that the rate of electron-electron and electron-ion
collisions is low, so that oscillations of the electron cloud are far oﬀ equilibrium and do
not change the electron distribution in momentum space. The oscillations produce the
perturbation δne(x, t) of the spatial electron distribution. If their amplitude is small
with respect to the spatial size a of the layer, the oscillations may be considered as
homogeneous (dipole) with the laser frequency ω
. This approximation corresponds
§
to the model of an incompressible ﬂuid for the electrons. For clusters in strong laser
ﬁelds, this model was used in reference [19], and its applicability was supported by
numerical simulations [20]. The time-dependent electron density then is given by a
rigid displacement by ξ(t) from its equilibrium density n0

and we deﬁne the z axis perpendicular to the plane of the ﬁlm (see Fig. 1). The
damping constant γ in equation (5) is related to the imaginary part of the dielectric
tensor [see equation (16) below].

‡ For clusters irradiated by a strong laser ﬁeld, the time when this assumption ceases to be valid has
been estimated, for example, in reference [23]. This time can be measured experimentally via the
dependence of the intensity of the scattered light on the laser pulse duration [5]. Both the estimates
and the experimental results support the conclusion that for nanobodies with radii around 100 A the
approximation of frozen ions holds up to a few hundred femtoseconds.

The rate Q of collisionless energy absorption is equal to the work per unit time of
the electric ﬁeld (9) on the individual electrons averaged over their distribution. For
a classical system as we consider it here, it is independent of Planck’s constant. Yet,
surprisingly, the simplest route for its calculation is via quantum mechanics. Following
[24], we consider electrons populating energy levels in the symmetric potential well
z), with some distribution function ρ(ǫ) and subject to the uniform electric
U (z) = U (
ﬁeld (9). The electron energy ǫ depends only on the principal quantum number n.
The ﬁeld produces electron transitions from their initial level n to a ﬁnal level n1. The
rate of energy absorption from the laser ﬁeld per unit time and per unit square of the
ﬁlm is

where w−
n,n1 are the transition probabilities per unit time of an electron
from the level n to the level n1 owing to absorption or emission of a laser photon,
respectively. The distribution function ρ may also depend on time, due to evaporation
of electrons from the well. Moreover, individual collisions or ﬂuctuations of the self-
consistent potential may inﬂuence the energy absorption. However, here we restrict
ourselves to the simplest limiting case, when individual collisions and ﬂuctuations may
be neglected and the quantum state of the electrons may be described in terms of wave
functions. Classically, such an approximation corresponds to the motion of electrons in
a given time-independent potential with specular reﬂection from the boundary whose
position depends on the electron energy. The opposite limiting case of diﬀuse reﬂection
of the electrons from the boundary will be brieﬂy considered in the next section.

where Ω(ǫ) is the round-trip frequency of an electron with energy ǫ in the self-consistent
potential U (z). The condition (12) admits a simple and transparent interpretation:
a nonzero contribution to energy absorption comes from those electrons only whose
period of motion in the potential U (z) is equal to an odd number of laser periods.
Therefore, as in the case of an inﬁnite plasma or cold ﬁnite plasma, energy absorption
proceeds through “resonant” particles.

The expression for the dielectric tensor εik(ω) may be found by a comparison of
the result (11) with the standard formula for the rate of energy absorption from a

3. Dependence on the boundary conditions

In our calculations so far, we have assumed that an electron moves inside a
thin ﬁlm under the action of the ﬁeld (9) and the self-consistent single-particle
potential U produced by the ion core and the quasi-equilibrium distribution of all
electrons. Individual collisions and ﬂuctuations both have been completely ignored.
In macroscopic language, this approximation corresponds to the specular reﬂection of
an electron from the boundary of a self-consistent potential. Below, we identify the
εs
L.
dielectric constant calculated in this approximation by the superscript “s”, εL →
In this case, the inﬂuence of the electric ﬁeld (9) on the electron motion is a coherent
eﬀect accumulated over many periods. This leads to the feature expressed by equation
(12): the energy absorption from the electric ﬁeld is possible only for selected electrons
with “resonant” energies ǫk, as explained below equation (12). All other energy levels
do not contribute to εs
L. However, the approximation of specular reﬂection is only a
limiting case, since collisions are present and do have an inﬂuence on the eﬃciency of
energy transfer. The reason is that they interrupt the coherent accumulation of the
phase of the electron motion. In consequence, energy absorption is possible even if
the resonance condition (12) is not satisﬁed. This may result in increased absorption
in comparison with the case of specular reﬂection.

A rigorous quantum-mechanical account of collisions requires a density-matrix
approach. However, an estimate of the eﬀect of collisions on Landau damping may
be obtained using a simple classical method. The inﬂuence of individual collisions
on the electron trajectory in a self-consistent ﬁeld increases when the velocity of the
in the vicinity of the turning points. Here, an electron can
electron is small, i.e.
experience a large momentum transfer in an individual collision and, as a result, will
lose the memory of its phase. To estimate the eﬀect of this phase mismatch, we use a
simple model for diﬀuse reﬂection of an electron on the boundary. We suppose, that
between the boundaries every electron moves in a self-consistent potential under the
action of the ﬁeld (9), but in the collision with the boundary the phase is reset, so
that subsequent trips of the electron between the boundaries are independent. In this
approximation, the total energy that the electron collects from the ﬁeld (9) is given
by the incoherent sum of the contributions from the various segments of the electron
motion between the turning points. Treating the electron classically, instead of (10)
we have for the rate of energy absorption by the 1D system

Q = lim

dǫf (ǫ)A(ǫ, τ ),

(18)

where A(ǫ, τ ) is the energy absorbed during the time τ by the electron with the energy
ǫ averaged over the initial conditions. Obviously, this energy is the incoherent sum
of the contributions from the various halfperiods within the time τ [see equation (19)
below].

In the linear approximation used in this paper, averaging over the initial
conditions is equivalent with averaging over the phase α of the ﬁeld (9) at the instant
of time when the electron starts from the boundary, so that

ﬁeld has the phase α. This time diﬀers from a half period of the unperturbed motion,
viz. π/Ω(ǫ), by terms that are linear in the amplitude of the ﬁeld. The quantity N is
the number of half periods within the time τ . so that N = τ /(π/Ω(ǫ)).

with initial conditions z(0) = z0(ǫ), where z0(ǫ) is one of the turning points for the

In contrast to the case of specular reﬂection when the general expression (11)
for the rate of energy absorption is, in principle, a functional of the self-consistent
potential, equation (20) cannot be solved in closed form for an arbitrary potential
U (z) even in linear approximation with respect to the ﬁeld (9)+. Therefore, the
case of diﬀuse reﬂection can be considered analytically only for some particular self-
consistent potential. In the next section, we will consider and compare the results for
specular and diﬀusive reﬂection for the simplest case of an inﬁnitely deep rectangular
well.

4. Discussion

If the distribution function f (ǫ) of the electrons and the self-consistent potential U (z)
are known, the contribution to the dielectric constant (17) and all relevant quantities
such as the reﬂection and absorption coeﬃcients and the rate of energy absorption
can easily be calculated from equations (11), (14), and (17), either numerically or
even in analytical form. A separate and still unsolved problem is the determination
of the quasi-equilibrium distribution function and the self-consistent potential for
electrons in a heated ionized ﬁlm. Here we consider the arguably simplest model: the
inﬁnitely deep rectangular 1D well, which permits a complete analytical treatment
both for specular and for diﬀuse boundary conditions. This is an example of a ‘closed’
potential, where electrons cannot leave the system even for arbitrarily high energy. In
other words, there is no evaporation of electrons from the ﬁlm after the self-consistent
potential has been established. In such a potential, global thermodynamic equilibrium
will be achieved and electrons will be distributed according to the Gibbs law, so that

This model provides a simple analytic expression for the dielectric constant, which
allows one to understand general properties of collisionless absorption in a classical
ﬁnite system.

Details of the calculations are given in Appendix B. Both for specular and
diﬀuse boundary conditions the dielectric constant εL is the product of the factor
ω2
p/ω2 and a function of the single parameter x =
vT/ωpa. This
feature simpliﬁes the analysis of the behavior of the rate. Plots of the function εL
calculated numerically from equations (B.2), (B.8), and (B.9) are given in Fig. 2.
In all cases, the low-temperature behavior of the dielectric constant is linear with
vT, i.e. the simple law (1) is recovered with vT in place of vF and
respect to x
+ This means that the solution of equation (20) cannot be analytically expressed via the solution
of the unperturbed equation as was done in the previous section for specuilar reﬂection. In linear
approximation with respect to the ﬁeld (9), equation (20) reduces to the Hill equation.

estimates below) usually correspond to the limit x

the oscillation frequency of a particle in the rectangular well increases with increasing
energy as √ǫ [see (B.1)]. This means that the upper ‘resonant’ level has the energy
meω2a2/2π2 [corresponding to k = 0 in the resonance condition (12)]; all other
‘resonant’ energy levels are at lower energies, near the bottom of the well. As a
result, for low temperature, when only the lowest energy levels are populated, the
number of ‘resonant’ levels participating in the absorption increases with increasing
temperature as T 2. Since the contribution of each level to the sum (B.2) decreases
as T −3/2, the dielectric constant is proportional to vT. In the opposite case, for high
temperature, the main contribution is given by the single upper level with Ω(ǫ) = ω.
Therefore, the rate of energy absorption is determined mainly by the derivative of the
v−3
distribution function in the vicinity of this level, which decreases like T −3/2
T
with increasing temperature.

Collisionless damping may inﬂuence reﬂection and absorption of a laser pulse
by a ﬁlm. For a thin ﬁlm the reﬂection coeﬃcient is small, R
1, and
depends weakly on the imaginary part of the dielectric constant. Therefore, the eﬀect
of Landau damping on reﬂection is tiny. We will not consider it here. In contrast, the
absorption coeﬃcient is proportional to the small parameter a/λ and depends strongly
on the imaginary part of the dielectric constant. To estimate the relative contribution
of Landau damping to absorption we consider a thin dielectric ﬁlm irradiated by an
1014W/cm2. Laser pulses with
infrared or optical femtosecond laser with intensity
such parameters are widely using in studies of the optical breakdown in dielectrics
(see [6] and references therein). The laser ﬁeld produces inner ionization from the
valence to the conduction band, where electrons behave as a classical plasma with
temperature close to the ponderomotive energy in the ﬁeld (9).

energy absorption is inner ionization. It contributes about 10 eV per electron at the
same intensity. However, the energy transfer per electron due to Landau damping
decreases linearly with increasing ﬁlm thickness a, while the eﬃciency of absorption
due to inner ionization practically does not depend on the thickness, at least so long
as it smaller than the skin depth. Therefore, for ﬁlms with thickness around 100 nm
the contributions from Landau damping and inner ionization to the energy absorption
will be comparable. Obviously, with increasing thickness the eﬀect of Landau damping
vanishes.

The main conclusion of the estimations presented above is that for thin ﬁlms with
a thickness below a few hundred nm Landau damping may dominate over the other
mechanisms of energy absorption. As a result, the mean electron energy observed in
spectra from laser-irradiated ﬁlms, which is approximately equal to the mean energy
(22) absorbed from the ﬁeld, should decrease proportionally to a−1 with increasing
thickness a. Indeed, a mean electron energy decrease with increasing thickness was
clearly observed in experiments with thin carbon ﬁlms [2].

The expressions obtained above are valid, strictly speaking, for a monocrystalline
ﬁlm. The consequences of Landau damping in polycrystalline ﬁlms may be diﬀerent if
the electrons remain trapped inside their respective crystal layers under the action of
the laser ﬁeld. This depends on the relation between the amplitude x0 of the electron
d then diﬀerent crystals may be
oscillations and the size d of the crystals. If x0 ≪
considered as independent systems. In this case, the expression for the rate must be
averaged over the orientations of the crystals so that it will become independent of
the laser polarization. Besides, spatial averaging will replace the width a of the ﬁlm
by the average size d of the crystals. Obviously, this limit is realized for low laser
d, a
intensity (depending on d). In the opposite case of high intensities, when x0 ≫
polycrystalline ﬁlm is expected to give the same response as a monocrystalline ﬁlm.

In the (xy) plane, the electron motion is free. Therefore, transitions between diﬀerent
energy levels only occur due to the action of the z component of the electric ﬁeld (9).

Beyond the linear approximation, the sinusoidally driven particle in the inﬁnitely
deep well can serve as a paradigm of chaotic motion [29]. The breakdown of the
invariant Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser tori for increasing laser ﬁeld strength has been
invoked to explain laser-induced damage thresholds [30].

where the parameter x is the same as in (B.2). We can see that in the case of diﬀuse
reﬂection it is not necessary for the electron to satisfy the resonance condition (12) in
order to absorb energy: all electrons gain some net energy from the ﬁeld. However, the
main contribution into absorption comes from the vicinities of the points z = π(2k+1).
Using the deﬁnition of the variable z in equation (B.8) it is easy to ﬁnd that this
condition is equivalent to the resonance condition (12).

Finally, this result can be easily generalized to the case when the electron
experiences exactly one specular reﬂection before the diﬀuse one. Physically, this
corresponds to a thin ﬁlm with diﬀerent boundary conditions on diﬀerent surfaces,
say to a ﬁlm having a sublayer. Using the same approach we get

Abstract

Accurate calculation of internal and surface scattering losses in fused silica microspheres is done.
We show that in microspheres internal scattering is partly inhibited as compared to losses in the
bulk material. We pay attention on the eﬀect of frozen thermodynamical capillary waves on surface
roughness. We calculate also the value of mode splitting due to backscattering and other eﬀects of
this backscattering.

Optical microsphere resonators1 working on whispering gallery modes combine several unique features – very high
quality factor, small size and eﬀective volume of ﬁeld localization with low cost, that make them very attractive for
future applications in optoelectronics and measurement science. Such microresonators may be for example used as
interferometers and ﬁlters with record ﬁnesse2,3, for QED experiments1,4,5 and for diode laser stabilization6. The
last application as for now looks the most intriguing as it allows to create centimeter size cheap tunable laser with
kilohertz linewidth.

Microspheres are prepared from fused silica or other pure glassy medium by autoforming under the action of surface

tension in the ﬂame of a microburner or in the CO2 beam.

The properties of the microspheres are analyzed theoretically and experimentally rather wide. The theory of
whispering gallery modes is well known from electrodynamics11 and methods of optimal coupling with them were

109 – very close to fundamental limit of internal
losses were obtained at He-Ne and near IR region9,3. Attempts to obtain higher Q moving to minimum of losses of
fused silica 1.55µm, were as for now unsuccessful. Besides chemosorbed water the reason may be surface scattering
on inhomogeneities.

Problems of scattering inside the microsphere and on its surface were analyzed formerly incompletely. Scattering
leads not only to the limitation of the Q-factor but also lifts degeneracy between degenerate sine and cosine modes.
This eﬀect may be observed as mode doublets8,10. Especially badly explored are questions of surface scattering. In
diﬀerent papers one may ﬁnd expressions leading not only to diﬀerent numerical estimates but to diﬀerent functional
dependencies from the size of the resonator and wavelength1,3,9,15.

1. Scattering on internal thermodynamical inhomogeneities and quality-factor of microspheres

Intrinsic scattering and absorption losses in microresonators were estimated previously from the bulk losses as:

Q =

2πn
αλ

,

where n is index of refraction α is intensity attenuation coeﬃcient and λ is wavelength. However, this approach is not
quite accurate for scattering. We remind here the method of derivation of scattering coeﬃcient α (see for example12)
to see what modiﬁcations should be made in Eq. (1) to take into account speciﬁc features of the microspheres.

Let us divide the whole volume of medium in small volume dv, each having due to ﬂuctuations dielectric constant
ǫ(~r) = δǫ(~r) + ǫ0. Internal small inhomogeneities in the ﬁeld of the mode behave as dipoles reradiating light in all
direction according to the Rayleigh formula:

where ϑ is the angle between the dipole axis (coinciding with polarization of ﬁeld) and direction of scattering, r is the
distance from scatterer.

The next step is to integrate Eq.(2) over all angles on large sphere (r

) to obtain total power of scattering.

However, for the microsphere this is not correct. We should take into account total internal reﬂection (TIR).

Beams falling on the surface under the angle larger than critical one γ0 = arcsin(1/n) will either go back in the mode
if this angle lies inside the mode’s caustic or will be suppressed in destructive interference during several reﬂections.
These beams may also go to another mode, which leads to internal mode coupling, but due to the rareness of mode
spectrum this eﬀect is negligible (speciﬁc case of coupling between oppositely circulating degenerate modes is analyzed
below separately). In this way, only beams falling under angles less than critical should be added to losses. We may
not take into account here Frensel transmission coeﬃcients as these beams may leave the resonator during several
reﬂections. Conditions for the cutting of angles for T E and T M modes are the following:

here d is the distance of the dipole from the surface and a is the radius of the microsphere. If d
correct for high-Q whispering gallery modes, the ﬁrst terms in (4) may be omitted and hence the result will not
depend from the size of the resonator. We skip here the following derivation of α by calculating thermodynamical
calculations as conditions of angle cutting for large microspheres do not interfere with it (see12).

Cutting conditions in this way may be taken into account by introducing suppression coeﬃcients:

This coeﬃcient KT E,T M is equal to the relation of complete scattered power to the power scattered on angles satisfying
conditions (4).

Numerical calculations for fused silica with n = 1.45 give

KT E = 2.8

KT M = 9.6

It follows from these values that TM-modes are less sensitive to intrinsic scattering losses, but these modes have
stronger ﬁeld on the surface, and therefore more sensitive to surface inhomogeneities and absorption on surface
contaminations.

2. Scattering on surface roughness

To analyze surface scattering we analogously to the previous section calculate the value of αss, describing losses of
travelling wave per unit length. We start with the same expression in integral form (2), but now shall take into
account only surface inhomogeneities. As before we should integrate this expression over angles with account of TIR,
but for surface dipoles the part of light scattered above the surface may go free. In this way, suppression coeﬃcient
may be taken as 2KT E,T M /(KT E,T M + 1). In calculations of attenuation coeﬃcient we as above for generality are
not taking it into account and insert only in ﬁnal formula for the quality-factor.

Let the wave with intensity distribution I(y, z) travels along a guiding surface along the local x-axis, y-axis is
chosen also along, and z-axis orthoganally to the surface. Small surface roughness leads to inhomogeneity of dielectric
constant:

δǫ(x, y, z) = (ǫ0 −

1)f (x, y)δ(z),

here δ(z) is delta function. If surface inhomogeneities are weakly correlated and their correlation function quickly
abates to zero on the scale much smaller than the wavelength, roughness may be described by only two parameters –
variance σ =

< f (x, y)2 > and correlation length B. In this case

Now we turn back to microsphere to calculate the ratio of intensities in above expression. For simplicity we limit
ourselves only with TE-mode, which usually have higher quality factor. As the intensity is proportional to the square
of electric ﬁeld, and ﬁelds are described by Bessel functions, using the same approximations as in7 we obtain for
TE-mode:

We may note that this expression is diﬀerent from expression obtained in3 but the reason is that the authors under-
estimated volumetric ratio 11 considering it proportional to √aλ and not a. In the same paper3 authors report on
measurement of surface roughness of fused silica by means of scanning tunneling microscope. Values B = 5nm and
σ = 1.7nm were estimated. On Fig.1 all calculated limitations on quality factor are plotted, on this graphics UV and
IR absorption in fused silica from literature13,12 are also taken into account. Bulk losses in fused silica were taken as:

For the estimates of surface scattering resonator radius a = 300µm was taken. One can see that for the measured
Q in He-Ne range suppression of scattering is compensated by surface scattering. For longer wavelengthes, it seems,
additional experiments are required. For very large spheres (several millimiters in diameter), quality factor suﬃciently
higher then 1011 may be obtained. It seams that even Q
1012 is not impossible as Rayleigh scattering may be
lowered by heat treatment on 25%14. The only unknown factor is surface absorption on hemosorbed layers of OH −
ions and water. It should scale linearly with a as surface scattering (estimate in3 is also based on the wrong volumetric
ratio and in this way incorrect) but its dependence on λ is unknown. It is known, however, that in the bulk hydroxil
ions lead to vibronic absorption peak at λ = 2.73µm and at obertones at 1.37, 0.95, 0.725 and 0.586µm.

Nevertheless the problem of surface scattering in microsperes is not yet closed neither theoretically nor experimen-
tally. It is reasonable to suggest that surface roughness may be attributed to surface capillary waves frozen during
solidiﬁcation. These waves leads to ﬂuctuations:

L is spherical angular function, and L > 1. If according to thermodynamics each wave has energy κT , then15

where ˜σ is the coeﬃcient of surface tension
200 dyn/cm for fused silica at temperature T = 1500K. Though
as estimates show the size of these ﬂuctuations will be several times less than measured in3, correlation function,
calculated for such inhomogeneities has logarithmic shape and in this way may not be characterized by correlation
length. Fluctuations on the scale of wavelength are of the same order as in nanoscale. In other words, our approach will

is also incorrect (it was shown16 and experimentally conﬁrmed17 that perturbation with M=0 (ellipticity if L=2), do

not perturb in the ﬁrst order of approximation quality factor at all). The problem of frozen capillary waves in any
case deserves special consideration.

Mode coupling in microspheres due to surface and internal inhomogeneities may be described using variational ap-
proach. Random deviations of dielectric constant may be written in the form:

where F (r) – is random radial function, and f (θ, φ) – is random angular function. In particular case of small surface
roughness when random ﬂuctuations of the surface of the sphere may be described as:

From the Maxwell equation, wave equation for the ﬁelds inside the microsphere with inhomogeneities may be

The solutions of unperturbed equation without inhomogeneities (if δǫ = 0) have the form

where ~ej(r, θ, φ) – is vector harmonic, satisfying Helmholtz equation:

and index j corresponds to all possible types of oscillations, and j = 0 corresponds to initially excited mode. Using
the method of slowly varying amplitudes we ﬁnd solution as:

To analyze the consequences of internal coupling between modes travelling in opposite directions on the output
characteristics of a resonator we may use the same quasigeometrical approach that we used in7 to analyze coupler
devices for the microspheres. For simplicity we analyze here only the case of ideally mode matched (or monomode)
coupler device. The set of equations for the internal and external amplitudes looks as follows:

If internal mode coupling constant is weaker than attenuation β < δ0 + δc than Eq.30 has only one resonance at
∆ω = 0 and backscattering is small. The situation is not very diﬀerent in this case from the case of one mode
analyzed in7. In temporal language it means that internal coupling simply has no time to build backscattered wave
during the ringdown time. Interesting is, however, that the regime of critical coupling (when Bt = 0) is shifted and
obtained not for δc = δ0 but for δ2
0 + β2 and in this case not all input power is lost in the resonator but some
part of it reﬂects back in the coupler.

c = δ2

This means that ringdown time is equal to the time needed to repump circulating mode in oppositely circulating one.

What is interesting and inevident that if δ0 ≪

δc (overcoupling) but still δ0 + δc < β then most part of input
power is backscattered and transmitted power tends to zero. This property may become extremely valuable for future
applications of microspheres in laser stabilization. To verify this result additional experiments are required, but we
saw many times that backscattering is practically absent when there is no splitting and practically does not depend
on loading when doublets are clearly seen (see Fig.3).

of coupling between modes than internal inhomogeneities (36). On (Fig. 3) results of calculation for fused silica

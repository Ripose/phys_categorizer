Negative refraction

In the 1960s, when the Russian physicist Victor Veselago ﬁrst speculated upon the prop-

erties of a hypothetical isotropic material which simultaneously exhibited negative relative

permittivity ǫr and negative relative permeability µr, the explosion of interest that was to

follow almost three decades later could scarcely have been foreseen. Amongst the many in-

triguing implications arising from ǫr < 0 and µr < 0, it is the prospect of negative refraction

which has in the past few years captured the imaginations of the optics and electromagnetics

research communities and inspired much lively debate [1].

At the time Veselago’s ideas concerning ǫr < 0 and µr < 0 were not widely followed up

since no materials — naturally–occurring or otherwise — conforming to ǫr < 0 and µr < 0

were known to exist. It was not until the dawn of the twenty ﬁrst century that interest in

this topic was dramatically rekindled following the ﬁrst reported experimental observation of

negative refraction by researchers at the University of California, San Diego [2]. The UCSD

group tracked the propagation of a microwave beam across the interface between air and a

composite metamaterial consisting of conducting wire and ring inclusions embedded peri-

odically on printed circuit boards. Further independent experimental reports have emerged

recently which conﬁrm the existence of microwave negative refraction in metamaterials [3, 4].

Negative phase velocity

While ǫr < 0 and µr < 0 is a suﬃcient condition for negative refraction, it is in fact not

a necessary condition nor is it strictly applicable to real materials. In reality, materials —

which are in essence collections of charged particles — cannot respond instantaneously to an

applied electromagnetic ﬁeld. Accordingly, all real materials are dissipative to some degree

and their constitutive parameters are complex–valued quantities whose imaginary parts arise

from dissipation. It is readily demonstrated that the key criterion for the negative refraction

of plane waves in real materials is that the phase velocity be oppositely directed to the

direction of energy ﬂow [5]. Materials supporting such planewave propagation are called

negative phase–velocity (NPV) materials to distinguish them from conventional positive

phase–velocity (PPV) materials in which the phase velocity and rate of energy ﬂow are co-

directional. In the quest for negative refraction, it is signiﬁcant that NPV propagation may

be predicted for materials when only one of ǫr and µr has a real part which is negative–valued.

With negative refraction in the microwave regime now appearing to be well–established,

current eﬀorts are directed towards higher frequencies [6] with optical negative refraction

being the ultimate goal. The scope for achieving NPV propagation and thereby negative

refraction is considerably broadened by considering anisotropic and bianisotropic materials.

For example, through the homogenization of an isotropic chiral material with a magnetically–

biased ferrite, both of which are PPV materials, a bianisotropic NPV homogenized composite

may be conceptualized [7].

A relativistic perspective

In the context of homogenous materials, we recently reported upon the exciting prospects for

NPV propagation and negative refraction which arise from the Lorentz covariance of the basic

2

laws of electromagnetics [8]. Suppose, from the perspective of an inertial reference frame Σ,

we have a PPV isotropic dielectric–magnetic material M. As viewed from the perspective
of another inertial frame Σ′ which translates at constant velocity v with respect to Σ, the

material M is not an isotropic dielectric–magnetic material at all. Instead, M considered
from Σ′ is a non–isotropic complex material whose electromagnetic constitutive properties

depend upon both the orientation and magnitude of v. Crucially, it has been found that the
material M can support NPV propagation provided that the inertial frame Σ′ from which it

is observed is translating with suﬃciently high velocity. Moreover, the converse applies too:

if we have material M which is an isotropic dielectric–medium supporting NPV propagation
in an inertial frame Σ then it may be considered from the perspective of an inertial frame Σ′
as a non–isotropic, electromagnetically–complex, PPV material provided that Σ′ translates

with suﬃciently high velocity with respect to Σ.

Commonplace terrestrial velocities are likely to be too low to give rise to NPV propaga-

tion in a material which supports PPV propagation when viewed at rest. However, one may

envisage relativistic negative refraction being exploited in astronomical scenarios such as,

for example, in the remote sensing of planetary and asteroidal surfaces from space stations.

Although current research activities relating to negative refraction are largely directed to-

wards the nanoscale, it may possibly be the case that space telemetry technologies will be

the ﬁrst to reap the beneﬁts of negative refraction. Furthermore, it is possible that many

unusual phenomenons would be discovered and/or explained by the application of the idea

of relativistic negative refraction to interpret data collected via telescopes. Perhaps, many

more planets, hitherto hidden, would be lit up on our space maps thereby!

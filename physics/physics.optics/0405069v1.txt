We investigate the critical points of the near ﬁeld intensity. It is shown that there are no local
maxima of the intensity outside dielectric surfaces and the only possible critical points are either
local minima or saddle points. Using the boundary charge method we investigate numerically the
ﬁeld distribution around star-like sets of prolate spheroids. The ﬁeld enhancement is shown to
achieve a value of several hundreds at critical points outside the surfaces of spheroids and of several
thousands near the surfaces.

Progress in near-ﬁeld optics is caused by development
of both experimental technique and mathematical meth-
ods of calculations of the near-ﬁeld structures. Near-ﬁeld
microscopy has been successfully used to overcome the
diﬀraction limit and to image with subwavelength reso-
lution various surface structures. Of particular interest
are large local ﬁelds induced at the surfaces of nanoparti-
cles. These ﬁelds result in giant ampliﬁcation of Raman
scattering that allows for detection of single molecules
[1].

In most cases investigated so far, the maximum ﬁeld
enhancement was obtained at the surface of a nanopar-
ticle. However, combining particles of various size and
shape one may attempt to construct a nanolens with the
region of the maximum ﬁeld intensity (a hot spot or a
nanofocus) located between nanoparticles. Recent com-
putations implementing the multiple spectral expansion
method [2] demonstrated the emergence of such a nanofo-
cus in a system consisting of a few metallic spheres of dif-
ferent size. Such a possibility is very important since it
allows for remote detection without the mechanical con-
tact between a molecule and a nanoparticle.

ε(ω, r) is the complex dielectric permittivity and Ein is
the electric ﬁeld amplitude of an incident electromagnetic
wave. Unlike traditional electrostatic problems, even if
energy losses inside nanoparticles are negligible the elec-
tric ﬁeld, E(r) and the potential, ϕ(r), may be complex-
valued functions due to the possible elliptical polarization
of the incident wave.

For the case of materially equal dielectric particles the
problem is conveniently reduced to a set of integral equa-
tions for the surface charge density, σ, induced at the
nanoparticles [3] or, equivalently, for the surface distribu-
tion of the normal electric ﬁeld [4]. Here, we use integral
equations in the form derived in [3]

The integration in Eq. (1) is carried over the surface of
all particles, which is generally composed of several parts,
vectors s and s′ belong to the surface, and n(s) stands
for the surface unit normal directed towards vacuum at s.
With known surface charge distribution one can calculate
the induced electric ﬁeld at the arbitrary point outside
the surface.

The main purpose of the present paper is to investi-
gate the ﬁne structure of hot spots using the numeric
solution of Eq. (1). We have investigated the star-like
sets composed of dielectric prolate spheroids depicted in
Fig. 1. Eq. (1) was approximated by a set of linear equa-
tions with the help of an appropriate triangulation of the
surfaces. The details of the numeric algorithm will be
discussed elsewhere.

Prior to discussing the results of numeric calculations,
we give the qualitative description of hot spots. To be
more rigorous, we deﬁne a hot spot as a point where the

To answer this question suppose that the critical point

In vicinity of this point, the
solution to the Poisson equation may be written as a

Let us consider ﬁrst the case of linear polarized inci-
dent wave; then Ein in Eq. (1) is a real vector. If the
losses inside dielectric particles are negligible,
ε(ω) = 0,
the resulting solution to the Poisson equation or, equiv-
alently, to integral equation (1) is a real-valued function.
According to Eq. (6) the condition of zero intensity gra-
dient at r = 0 is E0
0. It is a matter of simple
≡
algebra to check that this yields either to E0 = 0 or to
C = 0 in Eq. (5). The ﬁrst possibility, E0 = 0, corre-
sponds to the absolute minimum of the ﬁeld intensity,
I(0) = 0; this ﬁeld conﬁguration is used in the well-
known Paul traps. The second possibility means that
ϕ2(r) = 0 in Eqs. (4,6) and the quadratic part of the ex-
ϕ3(r). The latter expression is
pansion in Eq. (6) is E0
a harmonic function. According to the well-known prop-
erties of harmonic functions [5] it cannot take maximum
or minimum values inside its domain. The only possible
critical points are the saddle ones. Thus, with a linear
polarization of an incident wave and negligible losses the
ﬁeld intensity outside the surface of dielectric bodies may
be either zero at certain points or it may exhibit a saddle
point.

·∇

In the case of complex-valued ﬁelds the reasoning is
similar but more tedious. The zero-gradient condition,
I(r) = 0, does not necessarily means that ϕ2(r) in
∇
Eq. (4) vanish. However, one can investigate the eigen-
ϕ3(r))
values of the quadratic form
appearing in Eq. (6). It was found that all three eigen-
values are never negative simultaneously. Thus, the sig-

−
to the local minimum of the ﬁeld intensity that may now
exist even if E0
= 0. However, the most important en-
suing conclusion is that the ﬁeld intensity cannot take
maximal values outside the dielectric surfaces.

Now we turn to the discussion of the numeric solu-
tions to integral equation (1). We have investigated the
ﬁeld structure near the sets of prolate spheroids (Fig. 1).
For the examples discussed below, the aspect ratio of all
spheroids is 4 : 1, their centers are at r = 4.5 from the
origin. The complex dielectric permittivity, ε(ω), corre-
sponds to silver.

Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the normalized electric
ﬁeld at the origin on the frequency of the incident wave
for the conﬁguration depicted in Fig. 1a. The incident
wave is linear polarized with the electric ﬁeld vector along
the y axis, Ein = (0, 1, 0). The ﬁeld distribution along
y axis is also shown. The electric ﬁeld here is maximal
at the surfaces of spheroids. At the origin, there is the
maximum in zx plane and the minimum in y direction.
The signature of the saddle point at r = 0 is (
).
With the circular polarization of the incident wave, there
are just minor changes in the ﬁeld structure.

More complicated behavior is observed for the star
composed of three spheroids (Fig. 1b). Fig. 3a shows
the ﬁeld versus the frequency for the circular polarization
of the incident wave, Ein = (1, i, 0)/√2. The plasmon
resonance frequency (2.42 eV) in this case is a little red-
shifted compared to two spheroids (2.44 eV). The ﬁeld
structure, however, is entirely diﬀerent. The ﬁeld distri-
bution along the y axis is depicted in Fig. 3b. The two-
dimensional contour plot of the ﬁeld intensity is shown in
Fig. 4, where the the electric ﬁeld vectors are also plotted.
Instead of a single saddle point between two spheroids
now there are four critical points. The minimum in xy
sign in Fig. 4) is situated at the
plane (marked with

origin. Three others (
) are maximums in the radial
direction and minimums in the azimuthal direction. The
ﬁeld enhancement at these points is about
740.
Fig. 4 also shows the real and imaginary parts of the
electric ﬁeld vector. As is readily seen, the ellipticity of
the wave is essentially nonuniform, i.e., this conﬁguration
acts as a polarizer.

As it was already pointed out, the maximum ﬁeld
enhancement, which is on the order of 1500, is always
achieved at the surfaces of dielectric bodies. Notice,
that the ﬁeld enhancement provided by a single silver
nanosphere is less than 30. The ﬁeld enhancement at the
hot spots is also suﬃciently large,
740. Since the
Raman scattering is proportional to the fourth power of
the electric ﬁeld, the corresponding cross-section is re-
inforced by a factor of 1012. Preliminary computations
with with the increased aspect ratio and/or reduced dis-
tance between spheroids demonstrated, ﬁrst, the signif-
icant red shift of the plasmon resonance that may be
1.2 eV, and second, the further ﬁeld enhance-
about ω
ment at the hot spots that achieves a value of 2000. How-
ever, computations with very prolate spheroids require
very ﬁne triangulation of surfaces and, as a result, enor-

polarized waves with diﬀerent directions of the electric
ﬁeld and appropriate phase shifts.
In the symmetric
conﬁgurations like those shown in Fig. 1, each wave ex-
cites its own spheroid. The ﬁeld distributions depicted
in Figs. 4,7 appear as a result of interference.

To conclude, we have studied the near ﬁeld distribution
induced by star-like sets composed of prolate spheroids.
It was proved that the ﬁeld intensity may have either
minima or saddle points in the domain outside dielec-
tric bodies. With not too prolate spheroids, the ﬁeld
enhancement at the hot spots may achieve several hun-
dreds.

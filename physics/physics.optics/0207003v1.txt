The quasi-bound modes localized on stable periodic ray orbits of dielectric micro-cavities are
constructed in the short-wavelength limit using the parabolic equation method. These modes are
shown to coexist with irregularly spaced “chaotic” modes for the generic case. The wavevector
quantization rule for the quasi-bound modes is derived and given a simple physical interpretation in
terms of Fresnel reﬂection; quasi-bound modes are explictly constructed and compared to numerical
results. The eﬀect of discrete symmetries of the resonator is analyzed and shown to give rise to
quasi-degenerate multiplets; the average splitting of these multiplets is calculated by methods from
quantum chaos theory.

INTRODUCTION

There is currently a great deal of interest in dielectric micro-cavities which can serve as high-Q resonators by
conﬁning light on the basis of multiple reﬂections from a boundary of dielectric mismatch [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Such
resonators have been used to study fundamental optical physics such as cavity quantum electrodynamics [6, 7] and
have been proposed and demonstrated as the basis of both active and passive optical components [8, 9]. Of particular
interest in this work are dielectric micro-cavity lasers which have already been demonstrated for a wide variety
of shapes: spheres[10], cylinders [1], squares [11], hexagons [12], and deformed cylinders and spheres (asymmetric
resonant cavities [3] - ARCs)[4, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. The work on ARC micro-cavity lasers has shown the possibility of
producing high power directional emission from such lasers, which lase in diﬀerent spatial mode patterns depending
on the index of refraction and precise shape of the boundary. For example modes based on stable periodic ray orbits
with bow-tie [4] and triangular geometry [18] have been observed, as well as whispering gallery-like modes [16, 18]
which are not obviously related to any periodic ray orbit. In addition a periodic orbit mode can be selected for lasing
even if it is unstable [17, 19, 20]; due to the analogy to quantum wavefunctions based on unstable classical periodic
orbits, such modes have been termed “scarred” [21]. There is at present no quantitative understanding of the mode
selection mechanism in ARCs and theory has tended to work backwards from experimental observations; however
the passive cavity solutions have been found to explain quite well the observed lasing emission patterns. The formal
analogy between ARCs and the problem of classical and quantum billiards has given much insight into their emission
properties [1, 3]. For example it was predicted and recently observed that polymer ARCs of elliptical shape (index
n = 1.49) have dramatically diﬀerent emission patterns from quadrupolar shaped ARCs with the same major to minor
axis ratio [22]. The diﬀerence can be fully understood by the diﬀerent structure of the phase space for ray motion
in the two cases, the ellipse giving rise to integrable ray motion and the quadrupole to partially chaotic (mixed)
dynamics. Resonators are of course open systems for which radiation can leak out to inﬁnity. In the discussion of
the ray-wave correspondence immediately following we neglect this leakage assuming only perfect specular reﬂection
of light rays at the dielectric boundary. However the theory of ARCs [3, 5] includes these eﬀects and they will be
treated when relevant below.

As is well-known, the geometric optics of a uniform dielectric region with perfectly reﬂecting boundaries is formally
analogous to the problem of a point mass moving in a billiard and hence we may use the terminology of Hamiltonian
dynamics to describe ray motion in the resonator. As discussed below, we shall specialize to cylindrical geometries in
which the relevant motion will be in the the plane transverse to the axis, hence we focus on two-dimensional billiards.
The quadrupole billiard is an example of a generic deformation of the circle or cylinder in that it is smooth and
analytic and does not preserve any constant of motion. (Motion in the circle of course conserves angular momentum
and motion in a closed elliptical cavity conserves a generalized angular momentum, the product of the instantaneous

∗Electronic address: hakan.tureci@yale.edu

angular momenta with respect to each focus [23]). A generic deformation such as the quadrupole will lead to a
phase space for ray motion which has three types of possible motion (depending on the choice of initial conditions):
oscillatory motion in the vicinity of a stable periodic ray orbit, chaotic motion in regions associated with unstable
periodic ray orbits, and marginally stable motion associated with families of quasi-periodic orbits (motion on a so-
called KAM torus). To elucidate the structure of phase space it is conventional to plot a number of representative
trajectories in a two-dimensional cut through phase space, called the surface of section (Fig. 1). For our system the
surface of section corresponds to the boundary of the billiard and the coordinates of the ray are the polar angle φ
and the angle of incidence sin χ at each bounce. The three types of motion described above are illustrated for the
quadrupole billiard in Fig. 1 both in phase space and in real space.

by r(φ) = R(1 + ǫ cos 2φ) for ǫ = 0.072. Real-space ray trajectories corresponding to each region are indicated at left: a) A
quasi-periodic, marginally stable orbit. b) A stable four-bounce “diamond” periodic orbit (surrounded by stability “islands” in
the SOS) c) A chaotic ray trajectory. Orbits of type (b) have associated with them regular gaussian solutions as we will show
below.

≫

It has been shown [24] that the solutions of the wave equation for a generic shape such as the quadrupole can be
classiﬁed by their association with these three diﬀerent kinds of motion. The ray-mode (or wave-particle) correspon-
dence becomes stronger as we approach the short-wavelength (semi-classical) limit, which in this work is deﬁned by
1 where k is the wavevector and l is a typical linear dimension of the resonator, e.g. the average radius. The
kl
modes associated with quasi-periodic families can be treated semiclassically by eikonal methods of the type intro-
duced, e.g. by Keller [25], and referred to in its most general form as EBK (Einstein-Brillouin-Keller) quantization.
The individual modes associated with unstable periodic orbits and chaotic motion cannot be treated by any current
analytic methods (although the density of states for a chaotic system can be found by a sophisticated analytic method
based on Gutzwiller’s Trace Formula [26]). Finally, the modes associated with stable periodic orbits can be treated
by generalizations of gaussian optics and will be the focus of the current work.

If a mode is found by numerical solution, its interpretation in terms of the ray phase space can be determined with
reasonable accuracy by means of the Husimi projection onto the phase space (see Fig. 2), although it is well-known
that for kl not much greater than unity the exact solutions tend to smear out in the phase space over regions of order
1/kl and do not correspond very closely to speciﬁc classical structures. For a closed generic ARC the full spectrum will
look highly irregular (see Fig. 3(a)), but contained in the full spectrum will be regular sequences associated with tori
and stable periodic orbits (Fig. 3(b)). The stable periodic orbit modes will give the simplest such sequences consisting
of two diﬀerent constant spacings, one associated with the longitudinal quantization of the orbit (free spectral range)
and the other associated with transverse excitations. In the example of Fig. 3 the imbedded regular spectrum is due
to the stable “bow-tie” orbit. The regular portion of the spectrum is extracted by weighting each level by the overlap
of its Husimi function with the islands corresponding to the stable periodic orbit in the surface of section. Clearly,

hidden within this complex spectrum are simple regular mode sequences of the type familiar from Gaussian optics.
In the current work we show how to calculate the resonant energies and spatial intensity patterns of such modes
associated with arbitrary stable periodic ray orbits for both the ideal closed resonator and a dielectric resonator of
the same shape with arbitrary dielectric mismatch n. We shall refer to these as periodic orbit modes or PO modes.

FIG. 2: Black background gives the surface of section for the quadrupole at ǫ = 0.17 for which the four small islands correspond
to a stable bow-tie shaped orbit (inset). A numerical solution of the Helmholtz equation for this resonator can be projected
onto this surface of section via the Husimi transform [27] and is found to have high intensity (in false color scale) precisely on
these islands, indicating that this is a mode associated with the bow-tie orbit.

In the case of the open resonator, the modes have a width which can be expressed as a negative imaginary part
of k, and some of the PO modes may be so broad (short-lived) that they would not appear as sharp spectral lines.
Within the gaussian-optical theory we present below that this width is entirely determined by Fresnel reﬂection at
the interface and would be zero for a periodic orbit which has all bounces above the total internal reﬂection condition,
but would be quite large for a periodic orbit, such as the two-bounce Fabry-Perot orbit, which has normal incidence
on the boundary. An exact solution must ﬁnd a non-zero width for all PO modes, due to evanescent leakage across a
curved interface, even if all the bounces satisfy the total internal reﬂection condition.

Another limitation of the gaussian theory of stable PO modes is that it predicts exactly degenerate modes when
the associated orbit has discrete symmetries, even in cases for which a group-theoretic analysis shows that there can
be no exact symmetries (this is the case, for example in the quadrupole). Instead the exact solutions will have some
integer quasi-degeneracy in which the spectrum consists of nearly degenerate multiplets, whose multiplicity depends
in detail on the particular PO mode. This point is illustrated by the inset to Fig. 3(b). We will show below how to
calculate the multiplicity of these quasi-degeneracies for a given PO and introduce a theoretical approach to estimate
the size of the associated splittings.

II. GAUSSIAN OPTICAL APPROACH TO THE CLOSED CAVITY

The quantization of electromagnetic modes within dielectric bodies enclosed by metallic boundaries, including the
case of arbitrary index variation inside the resonator and three-dimensions has been treated before in the literature
[28]. However the generality of the treatment makes it diﬃcult to extract simple results of use to researchers working
with uniform dielectric optical micro-cavities; more importantly all the work of which we are aware focuses on the case

of Dirichlet boundary conditions corresponding to perfect reﬂection at the boundary. Perfect reﬂection of course leads
to true bound states. In the next section we show how to generalize these results to the correct boundary conditions
at a dielectric interface and hence for the case of quasi-bound as opposed to bound states. However, ﬁrst, in this
section we develop the formalism for the closed case which we will generalize to the case of interest. In all of this
work we will specialize to the case of two dimensions, corresponding to an inﬁnite dielectric cylinder with an arbitrary
cross-section in the transverse plane (see Fig. 4) with the condition kz = 0. To conform with conventions introduced
below we will refer to the two-dimensional coordinate system as (X, Z). In this case the TM and TE polarizations
separate and we have a scalar wave equation with simple continuity conditions at the boundary for the electric ﬁeld
(for TM) or magnetic ﬁeld (for TE). For the closed case (for which the ﬁeld is zero on the boundary) we can set the
index n = 1 and work simply with the Helmholtz equation.

FIG. 4: Illustration of the reduction of the Maxwell equation for an inﬁnite dielectric cylinder to the 2D Helmholtz equation
for the TM case (E ﬁeld parallel to axis) and kz = 0.

Consider the solutions E(X, Z) of the Helmholtz equation in two dimensions:

This solution is assumed to be deﬁned in a bounded two dimensional domain D, with a boundary ∂D on which E = 0,
leading to discrete real eigenvalues k. We are interested in a subset of these solutions for asymptotically large values of
k for which the eigenfunctions are localized around stable periodic orbits(POs) of the specularly reﬂecting boundary
∂D.

A. The Parabolic equation approximation

The “N-bounce PO”s corresponding to a boundary ∂D are the set of ray orbits which close upon themselves upon
reﬂecting specularly N times. The shape of the boundary deﬁnes a non-linear map from the incident angle and polar
angle at the mth bounce (φm, sin χm) to that at the m + 1 bounce. Typical trajectories of this map are shown in the
surface of section plot of Fig. 1. The period-N orbits are the ﬁxed points of the N th iteration of this map. For a given
period-N orbit (such as the period four “diamond” orbit shown in Fig. 5), let the length of mth segment (“arm”)
M
m=1 lm, and L = LN be the length of the entire PO. We
be lm, the accumulated distance from origin be LM =
are looking for modal solutions which are localized around the PO and decay in the transverse direction, hence we
express Eq. (1) in Cartesian coordinates (xm, zm) attached to the PO, where zm-axis is aligned with mth arm and
xm is the transverse coordinate. We also use z to denote the cumulative length along the PO, which varies in the
interval (

, +

P

).
We write the general solution as:

−∞

∞

where the “local set” (xm, zm) and the ﬁxed set (X, Z) are related by shifts and rotations (see Fig. 5). Next, in
accordance with the parabolic equation approximation [28], we assume that the main variation of the phase in z-
direction is linear (“slowly varying envelope approximation”) and factor it out:

This deﬁnition suggests deﬁning the origins of the local coordinates such that zm = z along the PO, and we do so
(see Fig. 5).

Next, we insert the solution Eq. (2) into Eq. (1) and using the invariance of the Laplacian, we obtain:

E(X, Z) =

Em(xm(X, Z), zm(X, Z))

ﬁxed on segments of the periodic orbit so that their respective z-axes are parallel to the segment, while their origins are set back
a distance Lm (or nLm for transmitted beam axes), so as to account for zeroth order phase accumulation between successive
bounce-points. ξ1, ξ2 are the common local coordinates at each bounce (index m suppressed). Scaled coordinates are denoted
by tildes, e.g. ˜xm = √kxm. The coordinate transformations at each bounce m are given by zi = Lm + ξ1 sin χi + ξ2 cos χi,

and the boundary condition translates into

Here
∇m is the Laplacian expressed in local coordinate system. This reduction is possible as long as the solutions
are well-localized, and the bounce points of the PO are well-separated (with respect to k−1), even if the PO were to
self-intersect. These assumptions will be justiﬁed by the ensuing construction.

Dropping for the moment the arm index, we will focus on Eq. (4). Inserting Eq. (3), we arrive at

Em + Em+1|∂D = 0

uxx + uzz + 2ikuz = 0

The basic assumption of the method is that after removing phase factor exp[ikz] which varies on the scale of the
u/l2, where l is a typical linear dimension associated
wavelength λ, the z-dependence of u is slow, i.e. uz ∼
u/l, uzz ∼

with the boundary, e.g. a chord length of the orbit or the curvature at a bounce point. In the semiclassical limit l
The transverse (x) variation of u on the other hand is assumed to occur on a scale √lλ, intermediate between the
wavelength and the cavity scale, l; hence the transverse variation of u(x, z) is much more rapid than its longitudinal
variation. This motivates us to introduce the scaling ˜x = √kx to treat this boundary layer, which leads to

We can now neglect the uzz term due to the condition kl

solution: cm, αm, βm (where Qm(z) = αmz + β); however due to its form our solution is uniquely determined by the
two ratios βm/αm, cm/√αm. Therefore we have the freedom to ﬁx one matching relation for the Qm by convention,

Here we always choose the principal branch of √Q. These conditions allow us to propagate any solution through a

reﬂection point via the reﬂection matrix
precisely the standard “ABCD” matrix of ray optics for reﬂection at arbitrary incidence angle (in the tangent plane)
from a curved mirror [29].
It follows that Qm and Qm+1 can be interpreted as the transverse coordinates of the
incident and reﬂected rays with respect to the PO, and that then Eq. (15) describes specular ray reﬂection at the
boundary, if the non-linear dynamics is linearized around the reﬂection point.

C. Ray dynamics in phase space

To formalize the relation to ray propagation in the paraxial limit we deﬁne the ray position coordinate to be Q and
P ). The

the discreteness of the dynamics in a natural manner, we will introduce “coordinates” for the ray, represented by a
z-independent column vector h. Any ray of the mth arm in the solution space of Eq. (13) can then be expressed by
a z-independent column vector hm

D. Single-valuedness and quantization

Having determined how to propagate an initial solution Q, P an arbitrary distance around the periodic orbit we
can generate a solution of the parabolic equation which satisﬁes the boundary conditions by an arbitrary initial choice
Q(0), P (0). However an arbitrary solution of this type will not reproduce itself after propagation by L (one loop

around the PO). Recalling that our solution is translated back into the two-dimensional space (X, Z) by Eq. (2), and
that the function E(X, Z) must be single-valued, we must require periodicity for our solutions

We will suppress again the reference to arm index and use the notation E(x, z) = Em(xm, zm) and u(x, z) =
um(xm, zm) whenever Lm−1 < z < Lm. Since the phase factor in E advances by exp[ikL] with each loop around the
periodic orbit and single-valuedness implies that

E(x, z + L) = E(x, z).

u(x, z + L)eikL = u(x, z).

This periodicity condition will only be solvable for discrete values of k and will lead to our quantization rule for the
PO modes.

From the form of u in Eq. (9) we see that the phase Ω(z) = Q′/Q will be unchanged if we choose (Q, P ) to be an
eigenvector (q1, p1)), (q2, p2) of the monodromy matrix as in this case the Q′(z + L) = λ1,2Q′(z), Q(z + L) = λ1,2Q(z)
and the ratio Ω(z) = Ω(z + L). The monodromy matrix is unimodular and symplectic and its eigenvalues come in
inverse pairs, which are either purely imaginary (stable case) or purely real (unstable and marginally stable cases).
If the PO is unstable and the eigenvalues are real, then the eigenvectors and hence Ω(z) are real. But a purely real
Ω(z) means that the gaussian factor in u(x, z) is purely imaginary and the solution does not decay in the direction
transverse to the PO, contradicting the initial assumption of the parabolic approximation to the Helmholtz equation.
Hence for unstable POs our construction is inconsistent and we cannot ﬁnd a solution of this form localized near the
PO.

On the other hand, for the stable case the eigenvalues come in complex conjugate pairs and the reality of the
monodromy matrix then implies that the eigenvectors cannot be purely real and are related by complex conjugation.
Therefore we can always construct a gaussian solution based on the eigenvector with ImΩ > 0 so that there is a
negative real part of the gaussian exponent and the resulting solution decays away from the PO. It is easy to check
that the range of the decay is

√λl as assumed above.

The eigenvectors of the monodromy matrix are sometimes referred to as Floquet rays of the corresponding Euler
equation. In a more formal discussion which can be straightforwardly generalized to arbitrary index variation and
three dimensions [28] our condition on the choice of Ω can be expressed by recalling that the two eigenvectors must
generate a constant Wronskian, and we will choose the eigenvector (q(z), p(z)) such that

∼

This condition implies ImΩ > 0. Note that the overall magnitude of the Wronskian is determined by our choice of
normalization of the eigenvectors and is here chosen to be unity.

Having made this uniquely determined choice (up to a scale factor) and using (

From Eq. (23) and Eq. (3), we ﬁnally obtain the quantization rule for the wavevectors of the bound states of the

where m is an integer, N is the number of bounces in the PO, ϕ is the Floquet phase obtained from the eigenvalues
of the monodromy matrix and Nµ is an integer known as the Maslov index in the non-linear dynamics literature [30].
It arises in the following manner. As already noted, the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix for stable POs are
q(L)/q(0)],
complex conjugate numbers of modulus unity whose phase is the Floquet phase. We can deﬁne ϕ = Arg[
where Arg[

·
p
Eq. (9), involves the square root of q(z) and will be sensitive to the number of times the phase of q(z) wraps around
the origin as z goes from zero to L. If this winding number (or Maslov index) is called Nµ then the actual phase
advance along the PO is ϕ + 2πNµ; if Nµ is odd this leads to an observable π phase shift in the solution not included

quantized values for kR (R is the average radius of the quadrupole).

where [
] denotes the integer part. There is no simple rule for reading oﬀ the Maslov index from the geometry of the
·
PO; however the Maslov index doesn’t aﬀect the free spectral range or the transverse mode spacing.

Except for the Maslov index, the quantization rule Eq. (27) is familiar from Fabry-Perot resonators. The longitudinal
mode index m gives rise to a free spectral range ∆klong = 2π/L for gaussian modes of a stable PO of length L. The
Floquet phase ϕ/2L is the zero-point energy associated with the transverse quantization of the mode and we will
shortly derive excited transverse modes with spacing ϕ/L. In Fig. 6, we plot for comparison the analytic solutions
for the bow-tie resonance just derived in comparison to a numerical solution of the same problem; both the intensity
patterns and the quantized value of k agree extremely well.

E. Transverse excited modes

As is well known, the solution Eq. (9) is only one family of the possible solutions of the parabolic equation Eq. (8)
satisfying the boundary conditions Eq. (5) and the periodicity condition Eq. (23), the one corresponding to the ground
state for transverse oscillations. Further solutions can be generated with algebraic techniques which were originally
developed in the context of quantum oscillators [31]. If we refer to Eq. (8) we see that we are looking for solutions of
(u) = 0, i.e. eigenfunctions of the diﬀerential operator with eigenvalue zero. It is natural following the analogy to

L
quantum oscillators to seek additional solutions by deﬁning lowering and raising operators.

Λ(z) =

iq(z)∂˜x + p(z)˜x

−

Λ†(z) = iq∗(z)∂˜x + p∗(z)˜x.

−

We can easily show that the operators (Λ, Λ†,
] = 0 and furthermore
L
q∗p) = 1. Deﬁning the “ground-state” solution we have found as u(0), the commutation condition
that [Λ, Λ†] = i(p∗q
implies that (Λ†u(0))(x, z) is also a solution of
(u) = 0. Further it can be checked that while (Λu(0)) = 0, (Λ†)u(0)
is a non-trivial solution. We can ﬁnd the wavevector quantization condition for this solution by calculating the
additional phase acquired by (Λ†u(0))(x, z) upon performing one loop around the orbit (Λ†u(0))(x, z + L). Noting that
q∗(z + L) = e−iϕq∗(z), p∗(z + L) = e−iϕp∗(z), we ﬁnd that Λ†(z + L) = e−iϕΛ†(z). Thus this solution will acquire an
additional phase

ϕ with respect to u(0). This means that the lth family of solutions

This result has the well-known interpretation of adding l transverse quanta kT = ϕ/L to the energy of the ground
state gaussian solution. Thus (in two dimensions) the general gaussian modes have two modes indices (l, m) corre-
sponding to the number of transverse and longitudinal quanta respectively and two diﬀerent uniform spacings in the
spectra (see Fig. 3(b)).

As noted in the introduction, the solutions we have found by the parabolic equation method do not reﬂect correctly
the discrete symmetries of the cavity which may be present. The theory of the symmetrized solutions and the breaking
of degeneracy is essentially the same for both the closed and open cavity and will be presented in section (IV) after
treating the open case in the next section.

III. OPENING THE CAVITY - THE DIELECTRIC RESONATOR

We now consider the wave equation for a uniform dielectric rod of arbitrary cross-section surrounded by vacuum.

As noted in the introduction, Maxwell’s equations separate into TM and TE polarized waves satisfying

2 + n(r)2k2

Ψ = 0

∇
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

D) = n and n(r

Maxwell boundary conditions translate into continuity of Ψ and its normal derivative across the boundary ∂D, deﬁned
by the discontinuity in n. Here Ψ = E(Ψ = B) for T M (T E) modes. We will only consider the case of a uniform
dielectric in vacuum for which the index of refraction n(r
D) = 1. Thus we have the Helmholtz
∈
equation with wave vector nk inside the dielectric and k outside. The solutions to the wave equation for this case
cannot exist only within the dielectric, as the continuity conditions at the dielectric interface do not allow such
solutions. On physical grounds we expect solutions at every value of the external wavevector k, corresponding to
elastic scattering from the dielectric, but that there will be narrow intervals δk for which these solutions will have
relatively high intensity within the dielectric, corresponding to the scattering resonances. A standard technique for
describing these resonances as they enter into laser theory is to impose the boundary condition that there exist only
outgoing waves external to the cavity. This boundary condition combined with the continuity conditions cannot be
satisﬁed for real wavevectors k and instead leads to discrete solutions at complex values of k, with the imaginary part
of k giving the width of the resonance. These discrete solutions are called quasi-bound modes or quasi-normal modes
[32]. We now show how such quasi-bound modes can be incorporated into the gaussian optical resonance theory just
described.

6∈

As before we look for solutions which, within the cavity, are localized around periodic orbits based on specular
reﬂection within the cavity.
In order to satisfy the boundary conditions the solutions outside the cavity will be
localized around rays extending out to inﬁnity in the directions determined by Snell’s law at the bounce point of the
PO. The quasi-bound state condition is imposed by insisting that the solutions along those rays to inﬁnity are only
outgoing. This can only be achieved by making k complex (assuming real index n). It is worth noting that there are
well-known corrections to specular reﬂection and refraction at a dielectric interface, for example the Goos-Hanchen
shift [33]. It is interesting to attempt to incorporate such eﬀects into our approach at higher order, however we do
not do so here and conﬁne ourselves to obtaining a consistent solution to lowest order in kl.

As before we will deﬁne the solution as the sum of solutions Em(xm, zm) attached to each segment of the PO and
deﬁne local coordinates (xm, zm) attached to the PO. Now in addition we need an outside solution at each reﬂection
point Emt with its own coordinate system (xmt, zmt) rotated by an angle given by Snell’s law applied to the direction
of the incident ray (see Fig. 5). The ansatz of Eq. (3) thus applies, where now the sum will run over 2N components,
which will include the transmitted ﬁelds. Introducing the slowly varying envelope approximation Eq. (2) and the
scalings ˜xmt = √kx, ˜xm = √nkx, we get the parabolic equation Eq. (8) for each component, at lowest order in k.
The boundary conditions close to the mth bounce point will take the form

Ei + Er|∂D− = Et|∂D+

(35)

and

and

∂nEi + ∂nEr|∂D− = ∂nEt|∂D+
Here ∂n is the normal derivative at the boundary. The alternative indices i, r, t stand for m, m+1 and mt, respectively.
Since the parabolic equation Eq. (8) is satisﬁed in appropriately scaled coordinates within each segment, we write all
solutions in the general form EM = AM exp(iΦM ) where ΦM = nM kz + i
M and AM = cm/√QM . Here M
stands for m or mt and nm = n, nmt = 1. As for the closed case, we need to determine QM , Q′
M and cM , so that the
boundary conditions are satisﬁed, and then impose single-valuedness to quantize k.

M Q−1

M ˜x2

2 Q′

(36)

Similarly to the closed case, the ﬁrst continuity condition Eq. (35) must be satisﬁed on an arc of size

√λl on the
boundary around each bounce point and that implies that the phases of the incident, transmitted and reﬂected waves
must be equal. This equality will be implemented in the coordinate system ( ˜ξ1, ˜ξ2) along the tangent and normal to
the boundary at the reﬂection point, as before. We can again expand the boundary as the arc of a circle of radius ρ,
the curvature at the bounce point. Since the equations are of the same form for each reﬂection point it is convenient
at this point to suppress the index m and use the indices i, r, t to denote the quantities associated with the incident,
reﬂected and transmitted wave at the mth bounce point.

∼

The analysis of the phase equality on the boundary for the incident and reﬂected waves is exactly the same as in
the closed case and again leads to Eq. (15) describing specular reﬂection. Equating the phases of the incident and
transmitted wave leads to:

where we have deﬁned χ = χm, ρ = ρm and all quantities are evaluated at z = Lm. Recalling that n sin χi = sin χt
we get up to O(1/√k)

where µ = cos χi/ cos χt and the relation Qi = µQt is a convention similar to Qr = Qi. Again, the matrix in Eq. (37)
is just the ABCD matrix for transmission of rays through a curved dielectric interface at arbitrary angle of incidence
in the tangential plane [29].

Using the phase equality on the boundary the continuity of the ﬁeld gives the general transport equation:

which becomes (using the conventions Qr = Qi, Qt = Qi/µ)

In order to ﬁnd the quantization condition we need a direct relation between ci and cr as we had in the closed case.
This is provided by the normal derivative boundary condition Eq. (36). Keeping only the leading terms this condition
becomes:

which is precisely the Fresnel reﬂection law at a (ﬂat) dielectric interface.

Now we impose the single-valuedness or periodicity condition to obtain the quantization rule for k.

Note however that we have a qualitatively diﬀerent situation than for the closed cavity; some amplitude can be lost
at each reﬂection and it will in general be impossible to make a loop around the PO and return to the same ﬁeld
amplitude unless k is complex. We have the condition

which can be satisﬁed by choosing Q(z), P (z) to be the appropriate eigenvector of the monodromy matrix (note that
is unchanged from the closed case as it only pertains to the propagation of the phase) and with this choice the

Recall that the Fresnel reﬂection law has the property that it gives a pure phase for rays incident above total
internal reﬂection. Thus the new term in the quantization law due to Fresnel reﬂection can be either purely real (all
bounces of PO totally internally reﬂected), purely positive imaginary (all bounces below TIR) or complex (some TIR
bounces, some refracted bounces). If we deﬁne: ϕf = Re[

As noted above, this result is only in the leading order approximation, and it ignores both the eﬀects of evanescent
leakage at a curved interface and the momentum width of the gaussian “beam” which leads to violations of ray optics.
These eﬀects will give a non-zero imaginary part (width) to all resonances, even those with all bounce points above
TIR.

In table I we present a comparison between the numerically obtained quantized wavevectors for a bow-tie resonance
and the values for the real and imaginary part of k predicted by Eq. (46) for three diﬀerent indices of refraction. Note
that the best agreement is for the case far from total internal reﬂection, and the worst agreement is the case near
TIR.

IV. SYMMETRY ANALYSIS AND QUASI-DEGENERACY

As noted above, the gaussian theory we have just presented predicts exact degeneracies if there exist several
symmetry-related stable orbits (note that in this context the same path traversed in the opposite sense is considered a
distinct symmetry-related orbit). However it is well-known that wave equations with discrete symmetries cannot have
a degeneracy which is larger than the largest dimension of the irreducible representations of the symmetry group of
the equation. Here we are concerned with the point group (rotations and reﬂections) of the dielectric resonator in two
dimensions. Let G be a group which leaves the cavity invariant. Then, if Ψ(x) is a solution to the Helmholtz equation,
so is Ψ(gx), where g
G and x = (X, Z). The symmetrized solutions, i.e. solutions which transform according to
the irreducible representations of G under the action of G, can be obtained by the projection operators of the group:

∈

PmE(x) =

dm
G
|

χm(g)E(gx)

| Xg∈G
Here dm is the dimensionality and χm(g) is the character of the mth irreducible representation and the solution so
obtained, denoted by Em(x) is the resulting symmetry-projected solution. For a given irreducible representation there
are as many symmetrized solutions as the dimension of that irreducible representation of G. We will focus here on
the case of the closed resonator, but the general principles apply to the open case as well.

A. Symmetrized modes for the quadrupole

{

C2 =

1, σX , σZ, σX σZ }

Let’s consider our canonical example, the quadrupole (see Fig. 5). The symmetry group of the quadrupole is G =
, the group of reﬂections about the X and Z axes. This group has four one-dimensional
C2 ⊗
representations only, and thus cannot have any exactly degenerate solutions (barring accidental degeneracy). The
existence of four irreducible representations means that given the one solution E(X, Z) we have constructed to the
Helmholtz equation, we can generate four linearly independent solutions by projection according to Eq. (49) above.
We will label the representations by m = (r, s), where r, s =
denotes the action of inversion of X and Z respectively.
The symmetrized solutions are then

±

E(++) = 1
E(−+) = 1

4 (e1 + e2 + e3 + e4), E(+−) = 1
e4), E(−−) = 1

where

e1 = E(X, Z), e2 = E(

X, Z), e3 = E(X,

Z), e4 = E(

X,

Z).

−

−

−

−

In this case the symmetrized solutions are just the solutions with deﬁnite parity with respect to the symmetry axes
of the quadrupole.

The key point here is that the within the parabolic equation approximation these four solutions are exactly degen-
erate, whereas our group-theoretic analysis for the exact Helmholtz equation tells us that they cannot be so, although
they will be nearly degenerate. Moreover our original solution E(X, Z) cannot be an exact solution, as it does not
transform as any irreducible representation of the symmetry group. A further important point is that while we can
always construct a number of symmetrized solutions equal to the sum of the dimensions of the irreducible representa-
tions, there is no guarantee that such a projection will yield a non-trivial solution. In fact in the case of the quadrupole
we will show below that for each quantized value of k only two of the projected solutions are non-trivial, leading to
quasi-degenerate doublets in the spectrum. We will present below a simple rule which allows one to calculate the
quasi-degeneracy given the periodic orbit and the symmetry group of the resonator.

Before discussing the general rule, we illustrate the basic procedure for the case of a bow-tie PO. Let ℓ1 and ℓ2 be

the lengths of the vertical and diagonal legs of the bow-tie, so that L = 2(ℓ1 + ℓ2) is the total length. Then,

The solutions are k-dependent and must be evaluated for the quantized values of k. Referring to the quantization
condition Eq. (27) we ﬁnd that the phase ζ = mπ where m is the longitudinal mode index of the state. Hence

Thus the quasi-degeneracy of the solutions is two for the bow-tie, the solutions with identical parity under σZ form
the doublets (see inset Fig. 3(b)), and these two parity types alternate in the spectrum every free spectral range. Note
that while we have illustrated the analysis for for the ground state (l = 0) one ﬁnds exactly the same result for the
lth transverse mode, with doublets paired according to the index m, independent of l.

This illustrates a general procedure, valid for any stable PO. First, one ﬁnds by the parabolic equation method a
non-symmetrized approximate solution E(X, Z) localized on the PO. Second, one generates the symmetrized solutions
from knowledge of the irreducible representations of the symmetry group. Third, one evaluates these solutions for the
quantized values of k; the non-zero solutions give one the quasi-degeneracy and the symmetry groupings (e.g. (++)
with (+
) in the above case). The same principles apply to mirror resonators with the same symmetry group. Note
that in the case of a high symmetry resonator (or mirror arrangement) e.g a square or a hexagon, for which there
exist two dimensional irreducible representations, exact degeneracy is possible and can be found by these methods.

−

B. Simple Rule for Quasi-Degeneracy

Although the construction just presented allows one to ﬁnd the quasi-degeneracy and symmetry pairing, it is
convenient when possible to have a simple rule to get the quasi-degeneracy and symmetry-pairing from the geometry
of the orbit. The quasi-degeneracy is easily determined by the following rule:

The quasi-degeneracy D is equal to the number of distinct classical periodic orbits which are related by the spatial

symmetry group and time-reversal symmetry.

In this rule “distinct” orbits are deﬁned as orbits which cannot be mapped into one another by time translation.
Therefore a self-retracing orbit such as the Fabry-Perot, two-bounce orbit, only counts as one orbit and is non-
degenerate (see table II). In contrast for a circulating orbit like the diamond no translation in time will take the orbit
into its time-reversed partner. This rule can be obtained from semiclassical methods similar to the Gutzwiller Trace
formula [34]. The density of states can be expressed by a summation over periodic orbits and their repetitions; for
stable periodic orbits the summation over repetitions yields a delta function at the semiclassical energies (corresponding
to the same wavevectors as we ﬁnd from our quantization rule). This approach would give an alternative derivation
of our results which is less familiar in optics than the parabolic equation method we have chosen. However the
semiclassical method makes it clear that there will be a mode for every distinct symmetry-related PO using the
deﬁnition we have just given (of course in this method, as in the parabolic equation method, one would predict an
exact degeneracy instead of the quasi-degeneracy we have discussed).

TABLE II: Table illustrating the application of the two symmetry rules to ﬁve simples POs. The second column is the total
number of orbits of this shape related by spatial symmetry; the third column is the total number of orbits of this shape
generated by time-reversal symmetry. By Rule 1 the quasi-degeneracy is the product of these two numbers. Column 4 gives
the symmetry-reduced orbit which leads via Rule 2 to the symmetry pairing indicated in column 5.

Let us illustrate the application of this rule. The bow-tie orbit goes into itself under all the reﬂection symmetries
and so spatial symmetry generates no new orbits; however time-reversal changes the sense of traversal of each leg of
the orbit and does give a distinct orbit. Thus the predicted quasi-degeneracy is two, which we found to be correct by
our explicit construction above. In contrast, the triangle orbit (see table II) has a symmetry related distinct orbit and
a deﬁnite sense of circulation which is reversed by time-reversal, hence it should have a quasi-degeneracy 2
2 = 4
leading to quartets instead of doublets. A few diﬀerent cases of this rule are illustrated in table II.

×

The rule we have just given tells one the quasi-degeneracy, D, but not the symmetry-pairing. For the case of
reﬂection symmetries one can state a second rule which determines these pairings. First fold the PO of interest back
into the symmetry-reduced resonator [34] (see table II) using reﬂection until it completes one period in the reduced
resonator. The symmetry-reduced resonator has boundaries which correspond to lines of reﬂection symmetry in the
original problem. Anti-symmetric solutions with respect to each of these lines of symmetry correspond to Dirichlet
boundary conditions; symmetric solutions must have zero derivative corresponding to Neumann boundary conditions.
The boundary conditions at the true boundary of the resonator don’t aﬀect the symmetry pairing. For each symmetry
choice one can evaluate the phase accumulated in the reduced resonator at each bounce, assigning a phase shift π
to each bounce oﬀ a“Dirichlet” internal boundary, and zero phase shift for each bounce oﬀ a “Neumann” internal
boundary. If two symmetry types lead to the same ﬁnal phase shift (modulo 2π) then those two symmetry types will
be paired and quasi-degenerate, otherwise not. A subtle issue is the question of how to count bounces at the corner
between two boundaries. The answer is that the semiclassical method really sums over orbits nearby the PO which
will then hit both boundaries and experience the sum of the two phase shifts.

We will illustrate this rule for the case of the bow-tie in the quadrupole. The symmetry reduced PO is shown
in the last column of table II.
It has one corner bounce, one bounce on the X axis and two boundary bounces.
The boundary bounces don’t matter as they will give the same phase shift for all symmetry types. The X axis

C. Evaluation of Mode Splittings

17

The symmetry analysis above can only determine the existence of quasi-degenerate multiplets with small splittings,
it cannot estimate the size of these splittings. In the phase space picture the splittings we are discussing come from
tunneling between distinct periodic orbits, referred to as “ dynamical tunneling” in the quantum chaos literature [35].
Techniques have been developed in that context for evaluating the splittings and we now apply those to the system
we are considering.

Dynamical tunneling in integrable systems is essentially similar to the textbook example of tunneling in one di-
mension (note that conservative dynamics in 1D is always integrable), and the splittings in such a case come from
ﬁrst order perturbation theory in the tunneling matrix element through an eﬀective barrier, just as they do for the
one-dimensional double well potential. Systems of the type we are considering, with mixed dynamics however show a
very striking diﬀerence. It has been found by both numerical simulations and analytic arguments that the dynamical
tunneling splittings in mixed systems are typically many order of magnitude larger than found for similar but inte-
grable systems [36, 37] (e.g in quadrupole vs. elliptical billiards). This diﬀerence can be traced to the mechanism of
“chaos-assisted tunneling” (CAT) . As opposed to the “direct” processes when the particle (ray) “tunnels” directly
from one orbit to the other, the CAT corresponds to the following three-step process: (i) tunneling from the periodic
orbit to the nearest point of the chaotic “sea”, (ii) classical propagation in the chaotic portion of the phase space
until the neighborhood of the other periodic orbit is reached, (iii) tunneling from the chaotic sea to the other periodic
orbit. Note that the chaos-assisted processes are formally of higher order in the perturbation theory. However the
corresponding matrix elements are much larger than those of the direct process. This can be understood intuitively
as the tunneling from the periodic orbit to the chaotic sea typically involves a much smaller “violation” of classical
mechanics and therefore has an exponentially larger amplitude.

FIG. 7: Schematic indicating a direct tunneling process (black arrow) and a chaos-assisted tunneling process (yellow arrow)
which would contribute to splitting of bow-tie doublets.

The contribution of chaos-assisted tunneling can be evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively using the so
called “three-level model” [36, 38], where the chaotic energy levels (the eigenstates localized in the chaotic portion
of the phase space) are represented by a single state EC with known statistical properties. The straightforward
diagonalization of the resulting matrix yields [38]

where ER is the semiclassical energy of the “regular” states (localized at the periodic orbits) which does not include
the tunneling contribution, and VRC is the corresponding coupling matrix element with the chaotic state. The
resonant denominator in Eq. (58) leads to strong ﬂuctuations of the CAT-related doublets, as is found in numerical
simulations[38]. The average behavior of the splittings however is determined by the matrix element VRC . By virtue
2 is proportional to the overlap of the Wigner
of the Wigner transformation [26] it can be shown [39] that
transforms of the ”regular” and “chaotic” states:

Assuming that, as required by Berry’s conjecture[40], on the average the Wigner function of a chaotic state is equally
distributed across the chaotic portion of the phase space, and using the analytical expressions for the regular eigenstates
calculated earlier, we ﬁnd

where

supporting the regular eigenstate. Note that Eq. (60) holds only on average, since chaos-assisted tunneling always
leads to strong ﬂuctuations of the splittings which are of the same order as the average [36].

vs kR; the red line denotes the prediction of Eq. (60) for the average splitting, the blue line an estimate of the splitting based
on the “direct” coupling. Note the large enhancement due to chaos-assisted tunneling and the large ﬂuctuations around the
mean splitting.

In Fig. 8 we show the numerically calculated splittings for the bow-tie resonances in a resonant cavity with a
ﬁxed quadrupolar deformation ǫ = 0.14, for diﬀerent values of kR. Note that although there are large ﬂuctuations
in the numerical data (as previously noted), the data are consistent with Eq. (60), while a calculation based on the
“direct” coupling severely underestimates the splittings. Unfortunately, due to the large ﬂuctuations in the splittings,
knowledge of the average splitting size does not accurately predict the splitting of a speciﬁc doublet. Note also that
small violations of symmetry in the fabrication of the resonator may lead to much larger splittings then these tunnel
splittings; such an eﬀect was recently observed for triangle-based modes of GaAs ARC micro-lasers [19].

For the bow-tie orbit the quasi-degeneracy is associated with time-reversal symmetry, but as discussed above, it can
equally well be associated with spatial symmetries and indeed this was the situation in the ﬁrst work on dynamical
tunneling [35]. Splittings of this type can also be adequately described using the framework developed in the present
section.

V. CONCLUSIONS

19

We have generalized gaussian optical resonator theory to describe the resonances associated with stable periodic
orbits of arbitrary shaped two-dimensional dielectric resonators using the parabolic equation method. The corre-
spondence to ray optics emerges naturally when imposing the boundary conditions at the dielectric interface which
leads to the appropriate ABCD matrices for reﬂection, transmission and propagation. For a perfectly-reﬂecting
cavity one gets quantized solutions at real values of k localized around the PO with mode spacings given by
∆klong = 2π/L, ∆ktrans = ϕ/L where L is the length of the PO and ϕ is the Floquet phase associated with the
eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix (round-trip ABCD matrix). For a dielectric cavity one ﬁnds similarly localized
quasi-bound solutions at quantized complex values of nk; in this case the imaginary part of nk is determined by
the Fresnel refractive loss at each bounce of the PO. Within this approximation the mode spacings are unchanged
from the closed case (except for the trivial factor of n). These regular modes coexist in a generic resonator with
more complicated modes associated with the chaotic regions of phase space. Generalization of our results to the
three-dimensional case appears straightforward for the scalar case and one expects only to have three-dimensional
versions of the ABCD matrices enter the theory leading to some diﬀerence in details. More interesting would be the
inclusion of the polarization degree of freedom, which seems possible in principle, but which we haven’t explored as
yet.

We noted that for a cavity with discrete symmetries one will typically be able to construct several symmetry-related,
nominally degenerate solutions of the wave equation for each PO. However group-theoretic arguments indicate that
the these solutions cannot be exactly degenerate and lead us to construct symmetrized solutions which form quasi-
degenerate multiplets. We presented a construction and then two simples rules for calculating the quasi-degeneracy of
these multiplets and their symmetry quantum numbers. In the ﬁnal section of the paper we show that the splittings
of these multiplets are much larger than expected, due to the phenomenon of “chaos-assisted” tunneling, and estimate
the average splitting in terms of classical quantities.

There are several limitations of this work which we hope to address in future work. One obvious shortcoming is
the prediction of zero width modes for the dielectric cavity if the underlying PO has all of its bounces above total
internal reﬂection. Internal reﬂection is not perfect for these systems at any angle of incidence for two reasons. First,
as these solutions describe gaussian beams with some momentum spread, every solution should have some plane-wave
amplitude at an angle of incidence for which it can be partially transmitted. This type of correction exists even for a
gaussian beam incident on an inﬁnite planar surface and leads to an outgoing beam direction which can be signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from that predicted from Snell’s law; we have analyzed the beam deﬂection for this case recently [41]. For
the case of the bow-tie modes of the dielectric resonator the eﬀect of the momentum spread in inducing a ﬁnite width
[42]. Second, due to the curvature of the interface in such
was also evaluated using a semiclassical method in ref.
resonators, there will always be some evanescent leakage, which we can think of as due to direct tunneling through the
angular momentum barrier as is known to occur even for perfectly circular resonators. We have evaluated this type
of correction also recently [39]. It is still not clear to what extent these eﬀects can be accounted for systematically
within a generalization of our approach here, e.g. to higher order in kl. One possibility we are exploring is that a
generalized ray optics with non-specular eﬀects included can describe the open resonator and its emission pattern.
Both experiments [4, 17] and numerical studies [17, 41] demonstrate that for kl not too large (
100) these higher
order eﬀects must be taken into account.

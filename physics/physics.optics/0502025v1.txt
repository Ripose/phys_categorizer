Previous work [I. Bialynicki-Birula, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 20402 (2004)] is extended to cover
more realistic examples of electromagnetic waves, viz. the Bessel beams. It is shown that electrons
may be guided by a Bessel beam with nonvanishing orbital angular momentum. The mechanism for
trapping the electrons near the electromagnetic vortex line of such a wave ﬁeld is the same as for the
Trojan states of Rydberg electrons produced by a circularly polarized wave. The main diﬀerence is
that in the present case the transverse motion of electrons in a beam is conﬁned under the action of
the electromagnetic wave alone, no additional attraction center is required. We also discuss brieﬂy
the motion of electrons in Neumann and Hankel beams.

INTRODUCTION

reality.

The purpose of this paper is to show that Bessel beams
of electromagnetic radiation (described in detail in the
textbook by Stratton [3]) may serve as beam guides for
charged particles. The conﬁning mechanism in the trans-
verse direction can be explained as due to an interplay
between the Lorentz force and the Coriolis force in the
frame rotating with the electromagnetic wave. Exact
analytic solutions of the Lorentz, Schr¨odinger, Klein-
Gordon, and Dirac equations describing beams of charged
particles moving in the presence of an electromagnetic
wave with a vortex line have been presented in [4] for
a special, very simple form of electromagnetic wave car-
rying angular momentum. These ﬁelds are not realis-
tic since the electric and magnetic ﬁelds grow without
bound with the distance from the vortex line. However,
the motion of particles in such Maxwell ﬁelds helps to
understand the conﬁnement mechanism of particles by
electromagnetic vortices.
In addition, these simple so-
lutions approximate very well more realistic solutions in
the vicinity of vortex lines.
In the present paper, we
shall show that the same conﬁning mechanism is respon-
sible for guiding electrons inside Bessel beams of electro-
magnetic ﬁeld. Bessel beams are still not fully realistic
because the ﬁeld vectors fall oﬀ too slowly to make the
energy ﬁnite, but they are much closer to the physical

∗This work combines two topics: Bessel beams of electromagnetic
radiation and Trojan states of electrons. To both of these research
areas Joe has made decisive contributions [1, 2].

Bessel beams of light were produced for the ﬁrst time
by Durnin, Miceli, and Eberly [1] using an annular slit.
Later, Bessel beams were produced also by other methods
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In order to trap electrons, as
we shall explain in the present paper, higher order Bessel
light beams are more useful. They were produced ﬁrst
by an axicon [13] and later in biaxial crystals [14]

II. BESSEL BEAMS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC
RADIATION

Bessel beams appear in a natural way as solutions of
Maxwell equations in cylindrical coordinates [3]. These
solutions are conveniently described using the (diﬀerently
normalized) Riemann-Silberstein [15, 16, 17, 18] vector

The separation of the complex vector F into its real (elec-

writing down the equations of motion for electrons.

Since we are interested in the beam-like ﬁelds, we shall

seek the solution of (2) in the form

Every solution of this equation gives rise to a non-

There are three coordinate systems which allow for

[19]). The sepa-
ration of variables in elliptic and parabolic coordinates
in the Helmholtz equation leads to Mathieu and Weber
functions, respectively. The corresponding nondiﬀract-
ing beams look quite intriguing but they seem to be very
diﬃcult to produce in reality. In the present paper we
shall restrict ourselves to the separation of variables in
polar coordinates that leads to Bessel functions. In the
degenerate case, when k⊥ = 0, the Helmholtz equation
reduces to the Laplace equation which separates in many
other coordinates [19] and has a plethora of solutions.
In particular, every analytic function of either x + iy or
x

iy is a solution.

The Bessel beam for M = 2 will play a special role in
our analysis because it is directly related to our earlier
work. Namely, the limit of the Bessel beam with M = 2,
0, is the following solution of the Maxwell
when k⊥ →
equations

This electromagnetic ﬁeld is a good (but not uniform)
approximation to the Bessel beam for M = 2 in the re-
gion where k⊥ρ and k2
⊥z/kz are much smaller than 1. It
is the simplest example of a solution of Maxwell equa-
tions characterized in [21] as “a vortex line riding atop a
null solution” (null solution means that E2
c2B2 = 0
and E
B = 0). Electromagnetic wave (9) is not a plane
wave but it has the properties found before only for plane
waves. As has been shown in [4], one may ﬁnd analytic
solutions of the Lorentz equations of motion of a charged
particle in this ﬁeld and also analytic solutions of the
Schr¨odinger, Dirac, and Klein -Gordon equations. In the
present work we have used this exactly soluble case as
a guide in our study of the particle’s motion in a Bessel
beam.

We shall analyze the motion of a charged particle in
a Bessel beam in a relativistic formulation in view of
possible applications to highly energetic electrons. The
equations of motion are in this case most conveniently

In our analysis there will always be a distinguished wave

k = ω/c. Therefore, it will be convenient to use 1/ω and
1/k as the natural units of time and distance. There are
also the characteristic amplitudes of the electric ﬁeld E0
and of the magnetic ﬁeld B0. Finally, we shall measure
the velocity of electrons in units of c. We would like to
stress that all values of electron velocities appearing in
this paper are the derivatives with respect to the proper
time τ . They can exceed the speed of light since they dif-
fer from the laboratory velocities by the relativistic factor

the interaction of the electron with the electromagnetic
ﬁeld is characterized by a single dimensionless parame-

the laser-strength parameter eE0/mcω or the wiggler pa-
rameter eB0/mω. Since in our case E0 = cB0, these
two numbers as equal. The equations of motion for the
dimensionless quantities have the form

to τ ω). In the next Section, these equations of motion
will be solved numerically for various initial conditions
and Bessel beam parameters. All calculations and plots
in this work were done with Mathematica [22].

IV. ELECTRONS GUIDED BY BESSEL BEAMS

Bessel beams are capable of trapping and guiding elec-
trons even when they have substantial initial transverse
velocities. For example, in the optical case (2π/k =

verse velocity as large as 0.0012 c are trapped by a Bessel
beam of moderate intensity of the order of 1014W/m2. In
Fig. 1 we show the electron trajectories obtained for three
diﬀerent transverse velocities and for a = 0.0002. In all
ﬁgures presented in this paper the ratio of the transverse
wave vector k⊥ to the longitudinal component of wave
vector kz is 1:100.

109Hz and the intensity 1.5

The trapping of relativistic electrons requires higher
values of a. This can be achieved either by increasing the
intensity or lowering the frequency. In Fig. 2 we show the
trajectories of electrons with initial transverse velocities
0.04 c, 0.08 c, and 0.12 c and for a = 0.14. This value of a
may, for example, correspond to the microwave frequency
109W/m2 (calcu-
ω = 2π

10−7a2ν2, where I
lated from the formula I = 3.0444
is in W/m2 and ν is in Hz). In Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 we show
the projection of the electron motion on the xy plane for
two diﬀerent sets of initial conditions. It is clearly seen
that the motion in the transverse plane is conﬁned to
the vicinity of the vortex line but its details depend very
much on the initial data. There is a substantial diﬀer-
ence between the slow and fast electrons — relativistic
trajectories exhibit much more elaborate patterns.

V. ELECTRONS TRAPPED IN HIGHER
ORBITS

The oscillatory behavior of Bessel functions suggests
a possibility of trapping the electrons between two adja-
cent maxima. Of course, a Bessel beam is far from be-
having like a static potential. However, it does produce
something like ring-shaped barriers in the transverse di-
rection. To illustrate this point, we show in Fig. 5 the
surface representing the radial component of the electric
ﬁeld. There are regions at distances of about 600, 1200,
and 1800 units, where the electric ﬁeld forms potential
wells of a sort where the electrons can perhaps be kept
on orbits. The calculation of the electron trajectories in
these regions (Fig. 6) fully conﬁrms this expectation. We
ﬁnd there stationary (though wiggly) orbits. In contrast
to ordinary bound states in static potentials, kinetic en-

solutions must be excluded if we allow the ﬁeld to oc-
cupy the whole space. However, when portions of space
where the singularities occur, due to the presence of some
obstacles, are inaccessible, then these singular solutions
must, in general, be included to satisfy the boundary
conditions. This takes place, for example, in the case of
cylindrical coaxial lines. In order to satisfy the boundary
conditions we have to include in the solution, in addition
to Bessel functions JM also the Neumann functions YM
(Bessel functions of the second kind). Since Neumann
functions satisfy the same diﬀerential equation as the
Bessel functions, the solutions of the Maxwell equations
describing Neumann beams can be obtained directly from
our formulas (8) by replacing all Bessel functions by the
corresponding Neumann functions. This will give a solu-
tion of the Maxwell equations everywhere, except on the
line ρ = 0. Assuming that the vicinity of this line is in
some way shielded, we can study the motion of electrons
in the region where the electromagnetic ﬁeld is regular.
In Fig. 7 we show two trajectories of electrons that were
obtained under similar conditions as those in Fig. 6 but
for a Neumann beam with M = 0. We can clearly see
that the same mechanism of stabilization in the trans-
verse plane is in place also for Neumann beams.

VII. TROJAN MECHANISM OF ELECTRON
TRAPPING

In order to understand the mechanism of electron trap-
ping near the electromagnetic vortex line, we shall rewrite

We can freeze the motion of the electric and magnetic
ﬁeld vectors by going to a new coordinate frame rotat-
ing with the frequency ω/M . The relevant coordinate
transformation in the cylindrical coordinate system has
the form φ
φ + εωt/M . This transformation elimi-
nates the time variable — in the rotating frame the elec-
tromagnetic forces become time independent. A typical
conﬁguration of the electric ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 8. This
conﬁguration resembles the forces acting on a ball mov-
ing on the saddle surface, shown in Fig. 9. Obviously,
such a ﬁeld conﬁguration does not have a stable equilib-
rium point. However, in a rotating frame, in addition

7

30

to the Lorentz force, there appear also the Coriolis force
and the centrifugal force. These two inertial forces, to-
gether with the electric ﬁeld of the wave, are responsible
for the electron trapping in the transverse direction. The
magnetic ﬁeld plays a less important role in the trapping
mechanism, as illustrated in Figs. 10 and 11. The present
case belongs to the same category of phenomena as the
Trojan asteroids [23, 24], the Trojan states of electrons in
atoms [2, 25] or in molecules [26], and the Paul trap [27].
In all these systems periodically changing forces lead to
a dynamical equilibrium.
In the case of Trojan states,
the periodical changes of the forces are due to rotation.
In the rotating frame the Coriolis force and the centrifu-
gal force create a dynamical equilibrium in an otherwise
unstable system. This mechanism is very well illustrated
with the use of a mechanical model, a rotating saddle
surface, displayed by W. Paul during his Nobel lecture
[27]. In our case, the rotating electric ﬁeld plays the cru-
cial role. The rotating pattern of the electric ﬁeld is seen
in Fig. 12.

M = JM

M or H (2)

The same trapping mechanism operates in the case
of Neumann beams. However, not all members of the
family of Bessel functions can be used for trapping elec-
trons. Special combinations of Bessel and Neumann func-
tions — the Hankel functions H (1)
M = JM + iYM and
H (2)
iYM — are of interest because they describe
outgoing and incoming waves [3]. The Hankel beam is
described by the Eq. (8) in which all functions JM are
replaced by either H (1)
M . The Hankel beams do
not seem to trap charged particles — we have not been
able to ﬁnd trapped trajectories. This is presumably due
to a diﬀerent structure of the ﬁeld vectors. In Fig. 13 we
display the radial component of the electric ﬁeld for the
M = 0 Hankel beam. It clearly has a diﬀerent charac-
ter that in the case of a Bessel beam (cf. Fig. 5). The
ring-shaped barriers are now even more pronounced than
those found for a Bessel beam shown in Fig. 5. The lack
of trapping, however, can be explained by a completely
diﬀerent pattern of the electric ﬁeld shown in Fig. 14.
The lines of force now spiral in, instead of forming the
saddle pattern of Figs. 8 and 9.

Bessel beams are the strongest at the ﬁrst maximum
and the value of the ﬁeld at subsequent maxima decreases
as 1/√ρ when we move away. Therefore, we may observe
analogs of scattering phenomena by sending electrons
from a distance towards the center of the beam. The
trajectories of scattered electrons are, however, quite dif-
ferent from those of potential scattering. Some of them
curve in an unexpected manner and there is an obvious
left-right asymmetry that is due to the rotation of the
ﬁeld around the vortex line (cf. Fig. 15).

APPENDIX A: LABELING MODE FUNCTIONS
WITH QUANTUM NUMBERS

The mode functions of the electromagnetic ﬁeld are
the analogues of the eigenfunctions of a set of opera-
tors in quantum mechanics. This analogy becomes even
more succinct when the Riemann-Silberstein vector F is
treated as a wave function of the photon [28]. The four
commuting operators whose eigenvalues serve as quan-
tum numbers that characterize the mode functions are
in our case: the z-component of the wave vector oper-
ator (or momentum divided by the Planck’s constant)

For a plane wave the helicity is associated with the sense
of circular polarization (right or left). More generally,

the helicity ε can be deﬁned as the sign of the projection
of the angular momentum ˆJ on the direction of the wave
vector

ˆε = sign(ˆJ

It follows from this formula that for monochromatic
waves ε coincides with the sign of the frequency. A Bessel

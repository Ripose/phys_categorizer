Abstract

We demonstrate a means of creating a digital image by using a two axis tilt micromirror
to scan a scene. For each diﬀerent orientation we extract a single grayscale value from the
mirror and combine them to form a single composite image. This allows one to choose the
distribution of the samples, and so in principle a variable resolution image could be created. We
demonstrate this ability to control resolution by constructing a voltage table that compensates
for the non-linear response of the mirrors to the applied voltage.

Micro-Opto-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MOEMS) is a relatively new ﬁeld which appears to have
a multitude of applications. Perhaps the best known MOEMS is the Texas Instruments’ Digital
Micromirror Device (DMD), which is an NxN array of SRAM cells, each covered by a tilting mirror
[1]. Each of these mirrors is either in a binary “on” or “oﬀ” state. The primary application of this
device is for the projection of images. Optical switching is another application area for MOEMS.
Here, mirrors can eliminate the costly conversion from the optical domain to the electrical domain
for switching. An example is Lucent’s WaveStar LambdaRouter, which used an 8x8 array of 2-axis
600 µm diameter micromirrors to achieve ﬁber array switching for 256 channels [2]. A later version
of the array consisted of 16x16 mirrors. Each mirror may be individually actuated and can achieve
100,000 distinct states [3].

In this letter, we present our initial results on photographic imaging with micromirror arrays.
Using a prototype which employs a 16x16 Lucent micromirror array we have been able to obtain
low resolution images with a single mirror, and illustrate a means of calibrating the mirrors for
imaging purposes. Note that while the term “imaging” is commonly associated with MOEMS, it
is usually not used in the sense of photographic imaging [4]. Exceptions include work done by
Nayar et al. with the DMD to extend dynamic range and work by Last et al. on micro-cameras
which use a 1-axis mirror to increase the ﬁeld of view[5, 6]. Previous work by the authors described
simulations and some manual experiments[7].

In conventional macroscopic photography there is the notion of image mosaicing, in which
one combines two or more images with some common overlap to create a single image of higher

1

resolution than its constituents. An omnidirectional example, which is the main motivation for this
work, is that done by Kropp et al. as part of the MIT City Scanning Project[8]. In mosaicing,
generally a camera is moved to obtain images. A conceivable alternative is to point the camera at
a movable mirror[9]. Here we propose the use of micromirrors for this purpose in conjunction with
a video camera for the purpose of obtaining one or more pixels from each image of the recorded
video and combining them to form an image. One characteristic of such a sensor is its ability to
sample in a prescribed fashion. For example, if an image was recorded, then it should be possible
to choose a region of the scene for closer inspection, and extract more samples from that region.
This becomes particularly attractive for wide angle or panoramic imaging in which the total solid
angle being imaged is large, and hence a relatively small number of pixels are allocated to a typical
steradian. For example, conventional panoramic imaging systems consisting of a curved mirror and
video camera have the drawback that the resolution is generally non-uniform. While it is possible
to design catadioptric systems that are equiresolution, these systems still lack the ability to “zoom
in” on an object of interest[10]. If a curved mirror is imaged with a micromirror though, more
pixels could be taken from the regions of interest. This could be especially useful for tracking and
surveillance applications.

Through a loan from Lucent Technologies, the authors obtained a 16x16 mirror array and the
associated control electronics. We have constructed images by scanning a test pattern consisting
of 5 mm squares, each broken into four sub-squares, two of which contained smaller checkerboard
patterns, with checkers .5 mm in the northwest sub-square and .25 mm in the southeast sub-square,
as depicted Fig. 1. Using a single mirror we extracted a single pixel from a ﬁxed single mirror of
the array. Fig. 2 is a schematic of our device and Fig. 3 is an image of the array. The Lucent
mirrors have a ±7 degree tilt, with voltages varying from ±120. Scanning the test pattern with
uniformly spaced voltages from -105 to -65 volts on one actuator and -79 to 80 volts on another
for a ﬁxed single mirror, we constructed a 160x160 composite grayscale image, depicted in Fig.
4, by extracting a single pixel from each image. The non-linear response of the mirrors to the
applied voltages results in a distorted image. Nevertheless, using this composite image, it was then
possible to build a non-linear table of voltages, which could sample the image uniformly. Thus
we may control how the scene is sampled. The table was built using the fact that the voltages
corresponding to the corners of the checkers were known. 81 sample points were chosen resulting
in two 9x9 voltage tables. These were then expanded to 129x129 tables via bilinear interpolation
and this table was then used to image the same test pattern. The result appears in Fig. 5. In both
images the .25 mm checkers are not visible, but the .5 mm checkers are, so clearly we are in some
sense at the limit of the resolution of the device. These images were created using a conventional
640x480 video camera (Sony DFW-V300) and a 75 mm double gauss macro lens. Our illumination
source was a 35W halogen lamp placed 7 cm from the test pattern, which was 6 cm away from
the array. The F/# of the lens could vary from F/4 to F/30 and we our data was collected at
approximately F/25. The camera was 125 cm from the array, which was tilted at a 45 degree angle
with the optical axis of the camera. See Fig. 2 for a schematic representation.

A technical issue that had to be overcome was reﬂection from the glass cover. The Lucent array
is covered with a sapphire window with an anti-reﬂection coating, which peaks at 1.4 µn. Thus in
the visible wavelength we experienced considerable reﬂection from the glass cover, but by careful
choice of orientation of the array and the test pattern we were able to minimize the reﬂected image
from the single mirror that we used.

A second technical problem arose due to the dead space between the mirrors. The camera/lens

2

should be focused on the test pattern of course, but generally this meant that objects at the depth
of the array were out of focus. As a result, the blur of the dead space made it impossible to resolve
the mirrors unless the mirrors and the test pattern both were within the depth of ﬁeld of the
camera.

What are the advantages of imaging with micromirror arrays? Our work here is merely a proof of
concept, and we reached the highest resolution using oﬀ the shelf optics immediately. Our ultimate
vision though is that one could have a sensor in which data was being gathered simultaneously
from all of the mirrors of the array at a high frame rate. Possibly several pixels could be extracted
from each mirror. The array we used was certainly not optimized for this application and there
were several technical issues that were not speciﬁc to the concept.

In a very optimistic scenario, if one has a 640x480 array which was used for a 1 second exposure
and a single pixel was extracted from each mirror in each frame at 30 frames per second, then
the resulting image would have 9 megapixels. This assumes that each mirror could be made to
image distinct regions of the scene, which is a technical issue not speciﬁc to our prototype.
In
other words, two adjacent mirrors will image practically the same solid angle. In order to avoid
this problem supplementary optics could to be introduced. There is also the alternative possibility
of “interweaving” the pixel values, but this would seem to require an extremely precise calibration
of the mirrors. On the other (even more optimistic) hand, if one could obtain 4 pixels from each
mirror at 60 frames per second, the resulting image would have 72 megapixels. Thus an enormous
omnidirectional image of a scene could be created, with a prescribed sampling density of the scene.
In any case, the point is that the performance limits of such a device would vary greatly with a
number of parameters, but in some scenarios the results are quite interesting. Nevertheless, an
advantage of imaging with micromirrors is that as frame rates and camera resolutions increase,
the same principles apply. The possible applications of this concept will depend heavily upon
technological advances in several areas.

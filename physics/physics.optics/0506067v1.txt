1 Introduction

Over many years, the theory of nondiﬀracting beams and pulses has been developed,

generalized and experimentally veriﬁed in many ﬁelds, such as optics, microwaves and

acoustics[1-11].

When propagating in a non-absorbing medium, this waves maintain their spatial

shape for long distances, i.e., they possess a large depth of ﬁeld.

However, the situation is not the same when dealing with absorbing media. In these

cases, both, the ordinary and the nondiﬀracting beams (and pulses) will suﬀer the same

eﬀect: an exponential attenuation along the propagation distance.

Here, we are going to show that, through suitable superpositions of equal frequency

Bessel beams, it is possible to obtain nondiﬀracting beams in absorbing media capable to

resist the losses eﬀects, maintaining the amplitude and the spot size of the central core

for long distances.

The method that will be developed here is a generalization of a previous one (also

developed by us)[12, 13], which was conceived for lossless media, where suitable super-

positions of Bessel beams are used to construct stationary wave ﬁelds with arbitrary

longitudinal intensity shape. Those new solutions were called Frozen Waves.

Before continue, some points are to be stressed: (a) the method developed here is

directed for poorly conductive media (σ/εω << 1) in the optical frequency range; actually

we are considering materials where the penetration depth of the optical beams are typically
> 10−4m;

(b) the energy absorption by the medium continues to occur normally, the

diﬀerence is that these new beams have an initial transverse ﬁeld distribution, such to be

able to reconstruct (even in the presence of absorption) their central cores for distances

considerably longer than the penetration depths of ordinary beams (nondiﬀracting or

2 The Mathematical Methodology

The method that will be developed in this section is based on Bessel beams superpo-

sitions, so, it is appropriate ﬁrst to recall some characteristics of these beams in absorbing

In the same way as for lossless media, we construct a Bessel beam in the absorbing

materials by superposing plane waves whose wave vectors lie on the surface of a cone

with vertex angle θ. The refractive index of the medium can be written as n(ω) =

nR(ω) + inI (ω), quantity nR being the real part of the complex refraction index and nI

the imaginary one, responsible by the absorbing eﬀects. For a plane wave, the penetration

depth δ of a wave with frequency ω0 is given by δ = c/2ω0nI.

In this way, a zero order Bessel beam in lossly media can be written as ψ =

media.

J0(kρρ)exp(iβz)exp(−iωt) with β = n(ω)ω cos θ/c = nRω cos θ/c+inIω cos θ/c ≡ βR+iβI;
kρ = nRω sin θ/c + inIω sin θ/c ≡ kρR + ikρI, and so k2

ρ = n2ω2/c2 − β2.

In this way

ψ = J0((kρR + ikρI)ρ)exp(iβRz)exp(−iωt)exp(−βI z), where βR, kρR are the real parts

of the longitudinal and transverse wave numbers, and βI, kρI are the imaginary ones,

while the absorption coeﬃcient of a Bessel beam with a axicon angle θ is given by

αθ = 2βI = 2nIω cos θ/c, its penetration depth being δ = 1/α = c/2ωnI cos θ.

Due to the fact that kρ is complex, the amplitude of the Bessel function J0(kρρ) starts

decreasing from ρ = 0 till the transverse distance ρ = 1/2kρI , and afterwards it starts

growing exponentially. This behavior is not physically acceptable, but one must remember

that it occurs only because of the fact that an ideal Bessel beam needs an inﬁnite aperture

to be generated. However, in any real situation, when a Bessel beam is generated by ﬁnite

apertures, that exponential growth in the transverse direction, starting after ρ = 1/2kρI ,

will not occur indeﬁnitely, stopping at a given value of ρ. Actually, taking into account

the size of the aperture generally used to generate optical Bessel beams, and the fact that

we are considering media that are poor conductors, that exponential growth does not

even happen, and the resulting Bessel beam only presents a decreasing intensity in the

transverse direction.

Let us now present our method.

Consider an absorbing medium with the complex refraction index n(ω) = nR(ω) +

inI(ω), and the following superposition of 2N + 1 Bessel beams with the same frequency

where βm = βRm + iβIm and kρm = kρRm + ikρIm.

Our goal is now to ﬁnd out the values of the longitudinal wave numbers βm and the

coeﬃcients Am in order to reproduce approximately, inside the interval 0 ≤ z ≤ L (on
the axis ρ = 0), a freely chosen longitudinal intensity pattern that we call |F (z)|2.

The problem was already solved and the method developed for the particular case of

lossless media[12, 13], i.e., when nI = 0 → βIm = 0. For those cases, it was sohwn that the

within the interval 0 ≤ z ≤ L, and, at same time, to regulate the spot size of the resulting

beam by the parameter Q, which can be also used to obtain large ﬁeld depths (see details

in Refs.[12, 13]).

However, when treating absorbing media, the procedure described in the last para-

graph does not work, due to the presence of the functions exp(−βImz) in the superposition

(1), since in this case that series does not result in a Fourier one when ρ = 0.

On attempting to overcome this limitation, let us write the real part of the longitudinal

wave number, in superposition (1), as

In this way the superposition (1) is written as

and kρm = kρRm + ikρIm is given by Eq.(2).

Now, let us examine the imaginary part of the longitudinal wave numbers. From

Eq.(8) the minimum and maximum values among the βIm are (βI)min = (Q −

2πN/L)nI/nR and (βI)max = (Q + 2πN/L)nI/nR, the central one being given by

βI ≡ (βI)m=0 = QnI/nR. With this in mind, let us evaluate the ratio

.

Thus, when ∆ << 1, there are no considerable diﬀerences among the various βIm,

being βIm ≈ βI for all m. And, in the same way, there are no considerable diﬀerences

among the exponential attenuation factors, since exp(−βImz) ≈ exp(−βIz). So, when

ρ = 0 the series in the r.h.s. of Eq.(7) can be considered approximately a truncated

Fourier series multiplied by the function exp(−βIz): and therefore superposition (7) can
be used to reproduce approximately the desired longitudinal intensity pattern |F (z)|2 (on

ρ = 0), within 0 ≤ z ≤ L, since the coeﬃcients Am are given by

Because we are adding together zero order Bessel functions, we can expect a good

weakly conductive, a stationary wave ﬁeld with a good transverse concentration, and

whose longitudinal intensity pattern (on ρ = 0) can assume approximately any desired

eralization of a previous one[12, 13] and consists in a superposition of Bessel beams

Eqs.(5)and (8), while their complex transverse wave numbers are given by Eq.(2), and,

ﬁnally, the coeﬃcients of the superposition are given by Eq.(10). The method is justiﬁed

since 4πN/LQ << 1; happily enough, this condition is satisﬁed in a great number of

long distances.

3 Examples: Almost Undistorted Beams in Absorb-

ing Media

Let us consider as the absorbing medium a biological tissue. In the wavelength range

280 − 300nm, proteins are the major absorbers, being the UV absorption similar for many

types of tissues.

A typical XeCl excimer laser (λ = 308nm → ω = 6.09 × 1015Hz) has a penetration

6

depth, in this case, of 5 cm; i.e., an absorption coeﬃcient α = 20m−1, and therefore nI =
0.49 × 10−6. The real part of the refraction index to this wavelength can be approximated
by nR = 1.5, and so, n = nR + inI = 1.5 + i 0.49 × 10−6.

A typical Bessel beam with ω0 = 6.09 × 1015Hz and with an axicon angle θ =

0.0033rad, when generated by an aperture, say, of radius R = 1 mm, can propagate

in vacuum a distance (its ﬁeld depth) equal to Z = R/ tan θ = 30 cm while resisting

the diﬀraction eﬀects. However, in the material medium considered here, the penetration

depth of this Bessel beam would be only zp = 5 cm.

Now, we can use the method of the previous section to obtain, in this same medium

and for the same wavelength, an almost undistorted beam capable of preserving its spot

size and the intensity of its central core for a distance many times larger than the typical

penetration depth of a ordinary beam (nondiﬀracting or not).

With this purpose, let us suppose that, for this material medium, we want a beam
(with ω0 = 6.09 × 1015Hz) that maintains amplitude and spot size of its central core for

a distance of 25 cm, i.e., a distance 5 times greater than the penetration depth of an

ordinary beam with the same frequency. We can model this beam by choosing the desired
longitudinal intensity pattern |F (z)|2 (on ρ = 0), within 0 ≤ z ≤ L,

1 for 0 ≤ z ≤ Z

(11)

and putting Z = 25 cm, with, for example, L = 33 cm.

Now, the Bessel beam superposition (7) can be used to reproduce approximately this

intensity pattern, and to this purpose let us choose Q = 0.9999ω0/c for the βRm in Eq.(5),

and N = 20 (what is allowed by inequality (6)).

Once we have chosen the values of Q, L and N, the values of the complex longitudinal

and transverse Bessel beams wave numbers happen to be deﬁned by relations (5), (8) and

(2). Eventually, we can use Eq.(10) and ﬁnd out the coeﬃcients Am of the fundamental

7

superposition (7), that deﬁnes the resulting stationary wave ﬁeld.

Let us just note that the condition 4πN/LQ << 1 is perfectly satisﬁed in this case.
In Fig.1(a) we compare the desired longitudinal intensity function |F (z)|2 with the

resulting stationary wave ﬁeld, obtained from the Bessel beam superposition (7), and one

can observe a good agreement between them. A better result could be reached by using

a higher value of N, which in this speciﬁc example may assume, according to inequality

(6), a maximum value of 158.

It is interesting to note that at this distance (25 cm), an ordinary beam would have

its initial ﬁeld intensity attenuated 148 times.

Figure 1: Comparison between the intensity of the desired longitudinal function F (z)
(solid line) and that obtained from the Bessel beam superposition (7) (dotted line). We
can observe a good agreement between them.

Figure 2(a) shows the 3D ﬁeld intensity of the resulting beam. One can see that

the ﬁeld possesses a good transverse localization (with a spot size smaller than 10µm),

it being capable of maintaining spot size and intensity of its central core till the desired

8

distance. Figure 2(b) shows the same picture, but in an orthogonal projection.

Figure 2: (a) Three-dimensional ﬁeld intensity of the resulting beam. (b) The same
ﬁgure in orthogonal projection.

As we have said in the Introduction, the energy absorption by the medium continues

to occur normally; the diﬀerence is that these new beams have an initial transverse ﬁeld

distribution intricate enough to be able to reconstruct (even in the presence of absorption)

their central cores till a certain distance. For a better visualization of this ﬁeld-intensity

distribution and of the energy ﬂux, Fig.3(a) shows the resulting beam, in an orthogonal

projection and in logaritmic scale.

It is clear that the energy comes from the lateral

regions, in order to reconstruct the central core of the beam. Figure 3(b) presents the

initial ﬁeld-intensity distribution on the aperture plane, at z = 0. We can note the

intricate transverse ﬁeld-intensity distribution needed for feeding the central core of the

beam along the propagation axis.

Obviously, the amount of energy necessary to construct these new beams is greater

than that necessary to generate an ordinary beam in a non-absorbing medium.

(b) Initial ﬁeld-intensity distribution on the aperture plane, at z = 0.

And it is also clear that there is a limitation on the depth of ﬁeld of these new beams.

For distances longer than 8 or 10 times the penetration depth of an ordinary beam,

besides a great energy demand, we meet the fact that the ﬁeld-intensity in the lateral

regions would be even higher than that of the core, and the ﬁeld would loose the usual

characteristics of a beam (transverse ﬁeld concentration).

4 Conclusion

In this paper we have shown that it is possible to construct almost undistorted beams

in absorbing media. These are obtained by suitable Bessel beams superpositions and are

capable to resist the loss eﬀects, maintaining amplitude and spot size of their central core

for long distances, when compared with the usual penetration depths of ordinary beams.

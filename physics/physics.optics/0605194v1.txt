We demonstrate how to control independently both spatial and temporal dynamics of slow light.
We reveal that specially designed nonlinear waveguide arrays with phase-shifted Bragg gratings
demonstrate the frequency-independent spatial diﬀraction near the edge of the photonic bandgap,
where the group velocity of light can be strongly reduced. We show in numerical simulations that
such structures allow a great ﬂexibility in designing and controlling dispersion characteristics, and
open a way for eﬃcient spatiotemporal self-trapping and the formation of slow-light optical bullets.

Nonlinear response is the fundamental property of op-
tical materials that leads to interaction of propagating
optical waves and allows all-optical switching for various
applications. Eﬃciency of nonlinear interactions can be
greatly enhanced in the regime of light propagation with
small group velocities [1]. The slow-light regime can be
realized when the frequency is tuned close to the edge of a
photonic bandgap where optical waves experience strong
Bragg scattering from a periodically-modulated dielec-
tric structure. These eﬀects were studied extensively in
the structures where the propagation direction is ﬁxed
by the waveguide geometry, including experimental ob-
servations of pulse propagation in ﬁbers [2] and AlGaAs
ridge waveguides [3] with Bragg gratings, or coupled-
defect waveguides in photonic crystals with two- or three-
dimensional modulation of the refractive index (see, e.g.,
Refs. [4, 5, 6]). In particular, it was demonstrated that
the group velocity and the corresponding pulse delay can
be tuned all-optically in nonlinear photonic structures,
and at the same time nonlinearity may compensate for
pulse broadening due to dispersion [2].

All-optical control of the spatial beam dynamics be-
comes possible in periodic two- (2D) or three-dimensional
(3D) photonic structures, where light can propagate in
various directions. The possibility for beam steering is
inherently linked to the eﬀect of beam spreading due
to diﬀraction. Similar to pulses, nonlinearity can sup-
press beam spreading and support the formation of non-
diﬀracting spatial optical solitons [7]. Recent studies
have emphasized many unique properties of spatial soli-
tons in periodic structures such as waveguide arrays or
photonic lattices [8, 9], where modulation in the trans-
verse spatial dimension fundamentally aﬀects the nonlin-
ear wave dynamics. There appear multiple angular band
gaps supporting the formation of spatial gap solitons,
which possess tunable steering properties [10]. Recent
experiments [11] demonstrated the eﬀect of simultaneous
spatial and temporal self-trapping of optical pulses in the
form of optical light bullets [12].

In this Letter, we address an outstanding key problem
and demonstrate how to perform dynamical tunability

over both the magnitude and direction of the speed of
light through all-optical control in the slow-light regime.
In order to realize an eﬀective nonlinear control, it is
necessary to balance the eﬀects of temporal dispersion in
the propagation and spatial diﬀraction in the transverse
directions. For this purpose, instead of usually studied
symmetric photonic crystals [13], here we suggest to con-
sider the photonic structures with multiple-scale modu-
lations in diﬀerent directions. This overcomes the lim-
itations of the previously studied 2D or 3D defect-free

photonic-crystal structures where diﬀraction usually in-
creases for smaller group velocities due to a shrinkage
of the isofrequency contours [14], thus greatly restrict-
ing the eﬃciency of spatial self-focusing of slow light.
Indeed, only quasi-localized nonlinear states with large
spatial extent were predicted for a slab 2D waveguide
with a 1D Bragg grating [15]. In a sharp contrast, in this
Letter we show that it is possible to realize the frequency-
independent diﬀraction near the edge of the bandgap in
specially designed Bragg-grating waveguide arrays. This
allows to engineer independently the strength of diﬀrac-
tion and dispersion in the slow-light regime, and thus
provides optimal conditions for the nonlinear control of
spatiotemporal pulse dynamics. In particular, we predict
and demonstrate numerically the formation of strongly
localized slow-light optical bullets in such structures.

The arrays of nonlinear optical waveguides which are
homogeneous in the propagation direction have been ex-
tensively studied in recent years, and many possibilities
for spatial beam control were demonstrated experimen-
tally [8, 9]. We reveal that new regimes of the spatiotem-
poral dynamics can be achieved in the waveguide arrays
modulated in the propagation direction with the period
satisfying the Bragg-resonance condition at the operating
frequency. Such structures can be fabricated in AlGaAs
samples, with accessible fast nonlinearity.

In the vicinity of the Bragg resonance, the evolution of
optical pulses can be modeled by a set of coupled-mode
nonlinear equations [16] for the slowly varying envelopes
of the forward (un) and backward (vn) propagating ﬁelds
in each of n−th waveguide. In the normalized form, these
equations can be written as follows,

where t and z are the dimensionless time and propagation
distance, respectively, C is the coupling coeﬃcient for the
modes of the neighboring waveguides, ρn characterizes
the eﬃciency of scattering from the Bragg grating, γ is
the nonlinear coeﬃcient, and the group velocity far from
the Bragg resonance is normalized to unity.

We reveal that both diﬀraction and dispersion can be
precisely tailored by introducing a phase shift between
the otherwise equivalent waveguide gratings, as illus-
trated in Figs. 1(a,b). Only two- and three-waveguide
nonlinear couplers with in-phase gratings were analyzed
before [17, 18]. Here, we consider the eﬀect of linear
phase shift of the gratings across the array characterized
by the scattering coeﬃcients ρn = ρ exp(−iϕn). With no
loss of generality, we can take ρ to be real and positive.
Then, the wave propagation in the linear regime (at small

intensities) can be fully deﬁned through the properties of
Floquet-Bloch eigenmodes,

(2)

(3)

un = u0 exp [iKn + iβz − iωt] ,

vn = v0 exp [i(K + ϕ)n + iβz − iωt] ,

where K and β are the transverse and longitudinal com-
ponents of the Bloch wavevector. After substituting
Eqs. (2) into the linearized equations (1) (with γ = 0),
we obtain the following relations,

u0[ω − β + 2C cos(K)] + v0ρ = 0,

u0ρ + v0[ω + β + 2C cos(K + ϕ)] = 0.

These are the eigenmode equations which deﬁne the dis-
persion properties of the Bloch waves, ω(K, β). Since
Eqs. (3) represent a square 2 × 2 matrix, there will ap-
pear two branches of the dispersion curves. These de-
pendencies determine the key features of the wave spec-
trum. First, the gaps may appear for a certain frequency
range, where the propagating waves with real K and
β are absent. We notice that quasi-2D spectral gaps
can indeed appear for the modes localized in the high-
index waveguides, i.e. below the light-line of the sub-
strate. Second, the spatial beam refraction and diﬀrac-
tion are deﬁned by the shape of the corresponding isofre-
quency contours. The propagation angle is deﬁned by the
value of α(ω, K) = −∂β/∂K, and the eﬀective diﬀrac-
tion experienced by the beam depends on the curvature,
D(ω, K) = −∂2β/∂K 2. Below, we analyze how these
fundamental characteristics can be controlled by select-
ing the phase shift ϕ between the Bragg gratings.

For the in-phase gratings [i.e., when ϕ = 0; see
Fig. 1(a)], the dispersion relation becomes ω(K, β) =
−2C cos(K) ± (ρ2 + β2)1/2.
It follows that the 2D
gap appears only when the waveguide coupling is weak,
C < ρ/2. On the other hand, the shape of the isofre-
quency contours is strongly frequency-dependent as the
transmission band edge is approached, see Fig. 1(c). This
happens because the position of the one-dimensional fre-
quency gap depends on the propagation direction.

We ﬁnd that the nature of wave dispersion is funda-
mentally altered for the waveguide structure with out-of-
phase shift of the neighboring gratings [i.e., when ϕ = π;
see Fig. 1(b)]. The corresponding dispersion relation has
a diﬀerent form, ω(K, β) = ±{ρ2 + [β − 2C cos(K)]2}1/2.
Moreover, for any propagation angle deﬁned by the trans-
verse Bloch wavevector component K, the width and po-
sition of the one-dimensional frequency gap remains the
same, |ω| < ρ. This unusual property leads to remark-
able spectral features. First, the 2D (quasi-)gap is al-
ways present in the spectrum irrespectively to the grat-
ing strength (ρ) and coupling between the waveguides
(C). Second, the shape of isofrequency contours does
not depend on frequency in the transmission band, see

Fig. 1(d). This means that the beam diﬀraction remains
the same even when the band edge is approached.

The dependence of diﬀraction on frequency strongly
aﬀects the shaping of short pulses with broad frequency
spectra. We perform numerical modeling of the pulse
dynamics, when the input beam is focused into a single
waveguide. The pulse duration is T = 10, and the central
frequency is ω0 = 1. The snapshots of the light intensity
after the pulse enters the photonic lattice are shown in
Figs. 1(e,f). For the structure with the in-phase gratings
[Figs. 1(e)], the spatial diﬀraction strongly depends on
frequency, creating a colored pattern similar to the su-
perprism eﬀect in photonic crystals [19]. For the phase-
shifted gratings, all the components inside the frequency
band experience exactly the same diﬀraction and propa-
gate together. As a result, the intensity proﬁle [Figs. 1(e)]
has precisely the same shape as for the discrete diﬀrac-
tion of monochromatic beams [8], with well-pronounced
ﬁeld minima and peak intensities at the outer wings.

The unique features of linear spectrum in arrays with
phase-shifted gratings suggest that these structures pro-
vide optimal conditions for a nonlinear control of the
pulse dynamics.
In particular, since the 2D gap ap-
pears for any values of the grating strength and waveg-
uide coupling, it is possible to choose these parameters
independently in order to balance the rates of dispersion
and diﬀraction. This allows for simultaneous compensa-
tion of the pulse broadening in space and time through
the nonlinear self-trapping eﬀect.
Indeed, we ﬁnd nu-
merically localized solutions of Eqs. (1) for stationary
and moving light bullets of the form of solitary waves
{u, v}n(z, t) = {eu, ev}n(z − V t) exp(−iωt), where V is the
propagation velocity. We conﬁrm that localization is pos-
sible in both the cases of positive (γ = +1) and negative
(γ = −1) nonlinear response, since anomalous or nor-
mal dispersion regimes can be accessed on either edges
of the photonic bandgap. The soliton solutions for dif-
ferent signs of γ can be mapped by changing ω → −ω
and making a corresponding transformation of pulse pro-
ﬁles. In Fig. 2, we show the characteristics of immobile
solitons such as energy and width vs. the frequency de-
tuning inside the bandgap for self-focusing nonlinearity.
These solitons have a well-pronounced X-shape near the
upper edge of the gap, becoming more localized inside
the gap as the pulse energy is increased. We notice how-
ever that these are fully localized states that should not
be confused with the so-called X-waves [20] which re-
main quasi-localized only over a ﬁnite propagation dis-
tance. The gap solitons can also propagate along the
waveguides, and we present the characteristic of moving
solitons in Fig. 3. These slow-light bullets become more
extended in both the transverse and longitudinal direc-
tions as the propagation velocity is increased.

Finally, we perform numerical simulations of the spa-
tiotemporal pulse dynamics in these structures. In the
linear regime, the pulse broadens in both transverse and

We have demonstrated that these waveguide arrays can
be employed for shaping and control of optical pulses si-
multaneously in space and time, and allow the formation
of optical bullets propagating with slow group velocities.
Such slow-light optical bullets oﬀer novel possibilities for
all-optical switching, steering, and control of short pulses.

longitudinal directions [Figs. 4(a-d)]. Nonlinear self-
action results in the pulse self-trapping in both space
and time [Figs. 4(e-h)]. In this example, the velocity of
the generated light bullet is below 30% of the speed of
light in the absence of the Bragg grating, and smaller
velocities can be accessed as well by controlling the fre-
quency of the input pulse. The proﬁle of the self-trapped
state shown in Fig. 4(h) closely resembles the shape of
the exact soliton solution shown in Fig. 3(d).

In conclusion, we have revealed that both spatial
diﬀraction and temporal dispersion can be engineered in-
dependently near the edge of the photonic bandgap in
the waveguide arrays with phase-shifted Bragg gratings.
We have shown that such structures possess quasi-two-
dimensional photonic bandgaps and provide optimal con-
ditions for self-localization of pulses in nonlinear media.

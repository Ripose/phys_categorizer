Abstract

We present a theoretical study of electromagnetic surface waves localized at an
interface separating a conventional uniform medium and a semi-inﬁnite 1-D photonic
crystal made of alternate left-handed metamaterial and right-handed material which
we refer to as left-handed photonic crystal. We ﬁnd novel type of surface mode’s
structure, the so-called surface Tamm states and demonstrate that the presence of
metamaterial in the photonic crystal structure allows for a ﬂexible control of the
dispersion properties of surface states, and can support the Tamm states with a
backward energy ﬂow and a vortex-like structure.

Key words: Tamm states; Photonic crystals; Metamaterials

1 Introduction

The left-handed metamaterial (LHM) with negative permittivity and negative
permeability has attracted much attention (1; 2; 3) and triggered the debates
on the application of the left-handed slab as so-called ”superlenses” (4; 5).
Over 30 years ago, Veselago (6), ﬁrst proposed that this peculiar medium pos-
sesses a negative refractive index, which has been demonstrated at microwave
frequencies in recent experiment (3). In such media, there are many interesting
properties such as the reversal of both Doppler eﬀect and Chernekov radia-
tion (6), ampliﬁcation of evanescent waves (4), and unusual photon tuneling
(7), negative giant Goos-Hanchen eﬀect (8). All these phenomena are rooted
in the fact that the phase velocity of light wave in the LHM is opposite to

the velocity of energy ﬂow, that is, the Poynting vector and wavevector are
antiparallel so that the wavevector, the electric ﬁeld, and the magnetic ﬁeld
form a left-handed (LH) system.

Interfaces between diﬀerent physical media can support a special type of local-
ized waves as Surface waves or surface modes where the wave vector becomes
complex causing the wave to exponentially decay away from the surface. Aside
from their intrinsic interest, surface electromagnetics waves have recently been
proposed (9; 10) as a way to eﬃciently inject light into a photonic crystal
waveguide, or to extract a focused beam from a channel. In periodic systems,
staggered surface modes are often referred to as Tamm states (11; 12) ﬁrst
identiﬁed as localized electronic states at the edge of a truncated periodic
potential. An optical analog of linear Tamm states has been described theo-
retically and demonstrated experimentally for an interface separating periodic
and homogeneous dielectric media (13; 14) . In optics, the periodic structures
have to be manufactured artiﬁcially in order to manipulate dispersion prop-
erties of light in a similar way as the properties of electrons are controlled in
crystals.

One-dimensional photonic crystal consisting of alternate LHM and conven-
tional right-handed material (RHM) layers have already been investigated
through calculating the transmittance or the reﬂectance the structures (7;
15)and demonstrating of complete band gap (16). In this letter we demon-
strate another example of unusual properties of LHM and study electromag-
netic surface TE waves guided by an interface between RHM and a 1D periodic
structure consisting of alternate LHM and RHM layers which we refer to left-
handed photonic crystal. We demonstrate that the presence of a LHM allows
for a ﬂexible control of the dispersion properties of surface states.

We pay special attention to the terminating layer (or cap layer) of the periodic
structure and assume that it has the width diﬀerent from the width of other
layers of the structure. We study the eﬀect of the width of this termination
layer on surface states, and explore a possibility to control the dispersion
properties of surface waves by adjusting termination layer thickness. We ﬁnd
novel types of surface Tamm states at the interface with the LH photonic
crystal. In addition to absolutely novel structure due to sharp jumps at the
interface of layers resulting from opposite signs of permeability of adjacent
layers, these modes have a backward ﬂow and a vortex-like structure. The
surface modes in this case we call left-handed Tamm states.

2 Transfer matrix method and surface waves

We use the transfer matrix method to describe surface Tamm states that form
at the interface between an uniform medium and a semi-inﬁnite one dimen-
sional photonic crystal containing negative refraction metamaterial. Geometry
of our problem is sketched in Fig. 1. We choose a coordinate system in which
the layers have normal vector along OZ. As shown in Fig. 1 the crystal is
capped by a layer of the same material but diﬀerent width, dc. For conve-
nience of presentation, we split this termination layer of index of refraction n1
and width dc into sublayers, of lengths ds +dt = dc. The ﬁrst sublayers extends
from z = −ds to z = 0. Then the periodic array that forms the one dimensional
photonic crystal consists of cells each made of three uniform layers of widths
dt, d2, and d1 − dt whose respective indices of refraction are n1, n2, and n1. We
consider the propagation of TE-polarized waves described by one component
of the electric ﬁeld, E=Ey, and governed by a scalar Helmholtz-type equation.
We look for stationary solutions propagating along the interface with the char-
acteristic dependence, ∼ exp[-iω(t − βx/c)], where ω is an angular frequency,
β is the normalized wavenumber component along the interface, and c is the
speed of light, and present this equation in the form,

Surface modes correspond to localized solutions with the ﬁeld E decaying
from the interface in both the directions. In the left-side homogeneous medium
(z < −ds, see Fig. 1), the ﬁelds are decaying provided β > ε0µ0 . In the right
side periodic structure, the waves are the Bloch modes

E(z) = Ψ(z)exp(iKbz)

where Kb is the Bloch wavenumber, and Ψ(z) is the Bloch function which is
periodic with the period of the photonic structure (see details, e.g., in Ref.
(17)). In the periodic structure the waves will be decaying provided Kb is
complex; and this condition deﬁnes the spectral gaps of an inﬁnite photonic
crystal. For the calculation of the Bloch modes, we use the well-known transfer
matrix method (17).

To ﬁnd the Tamm states, we take solutions of Eq. (1) in a homogeneous
medium and the Bloch modes in the periodic structure and satisfy the con-
ditions of continuity of the tangential components of the electric and mag-
netic ﬁelds at the interface between homogeneous medium and periodic struc-
ture (18).

3 Results and discussion

We summarize the dispersion properties of the Tamm states in the ﬁrst and
second spectral gaps on the plane of the free-space wavenumber k = ω/c versus
the propagation constant β (see Fig. 2) for diﬀerent values of the cap layer
thickness dc.

As mentioned above, Tamm states exist in the gaps of the photonic bangap
spectrum (unshaded regions in Fig. 2). An important point that we can see
from Fig. 2 is that the sign of the slope of the dispersion curve changes at
one (or two) extremum point at ﬁrst (or second) bandgap, respectively. The
slope of the dispersion curve determine the corresponding group velocity of the
mode. According to the energy ﬂow of modes (see Fig. 4) positive (negative)

slope of dispersion curve, here, correspond with backward (forward) energy of
mode which we call backward (forward) Tamm states. So, for a thin cap, dc =
0.6d1, the backward Tamm states occur at the incidence angles corresponding
β > 1.17, while backward Tamm state for thick cap dc = 1.2d1 take place at
wide ranges β > 1.02. Meanwhile the LH Tamm surface wave has a vortex-like
energy ﬂow pattern.

As a result of diﬀerent slope of the dispersion curve of the LH Tamm states, we
observe the mode degeneracy, i.e, for the same frequency ω (or wavenumber
k), there exist two modes with diﬀerent value of β in ﬁrst bandgap (see lower
inset in Fig. 2) while, we can see three modes with diﬀerent value of β in
second bandgap (see upper inset in Fig. 2). There are modes with negative and
positive group velocities (with respect to the propagation wavevector). Such
modes are termed as forward and backward , respectively. In the forward wave,
the direction of the total energy ﬂow coincides with the propagation direction,
while in the backward wave the energy ﬂow is backwards with respect to
the wavevector. Physically, this diﬀerence can be explained by looking at the
transverse structure of modes. In Figs. 3 (a,b) we plot the proﬁles of the
two modes having the same frequency k = ω/c = 1.037cm−1, with diﬀerent
longitudinal wavenumber β. Corresponding points are shown in the lower inset
in Fig. 2. For the mode (a), the energy ﬂow in the homogeneous RHM exceeds
that eﬀective backward energy ﬂow in the periodic structure (slow decay of
ﬁeld for z < −ds and fast decay into the periodic structure), thus the total
energy ﬂow is forward. For the mode (b) we have the opposite case, and the
mode is backward. To demonstrate this, in Fig. 4 we plot the total energy

ﬂow in the modes as a function of the wavenumber β for ﬁrst and second
bandgap surface modes. These results conﬁrm our discussion based on the
analysis of the dispersion characteristics. One can see from Fig. 4 that the
increasing the cap layer thickness, dc leads to wide range of backward modes
(campare energy ﬂow of dc = 0.6d1 and dc = 1.2d1). In the conventional
geometry consisting of RHM layers hence right-handed (RH)Tamm state the
energy ﬂow in all parts of the wave are directed along the wave number and
the localized surface waves are always forward. An example of the second-gap
mode proﬁle is shown in Fig. 3(d). One can see that the second band modes are
generally weaker localized at the interface then the modes from the ﬁrst band
gap. In addition, the oscillation period of the transverse structure of modes at
the ﬁrst bandgap is twice of the physical structure of photonic crystal while
these are equal at the second bandgap.

Finally, in Fig. 5 we plot the existence regions for the surface Tamm modes for

plane (dc, β). Shaded is the area where the surface modes do not exist. Increas-
ing the cap layer thickness, dc, we eﬀectively obtain a dielectric waveguide, one
cladding of which is a homogeneous medium, while the other one is a LH pho-
tonic crystal. In such a case a typical mode is shown in Fig. 3(c). Fig. 5 shows
that the non-existence regions of Tamm states qualitatively diﬀerent for ﬁrst
and second bandgaps. While there exist three discrate non-existence regions
of Tamm states for ﬁrst bandgap, we found ﬁve discrate non-existence regions
of Tamm states for second bandgap including backward and forward modes.

4 Conclusions

We have studied novel types of electromagnetic surface waves guided by an
interface between a homogeneous conventional material and a one-dimensional
LH photonic crystal consisting of alternate LHM and RHM layers. We have
shown that in the presence of a LHM in the photonic crystal structure the
surface Tamm waves ﬁrstly have a absolutely novel shape with a sharp jumps
in the interface of layers due to opposite signs of the permeability in two adja-
cent media, secondly can be either forward or backward. It must be noted that
Tamm states for conventional structure are always forward. We have studied
the properties of the ﬁrst and second bandgap Tamm states and analysed the
existence regions for both band modes. We believe our results will be useful
for a deeper understanding of the properties of surface waves in plasmonic and
metamaterial systems.

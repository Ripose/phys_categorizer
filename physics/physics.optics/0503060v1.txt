Abstract

We show that Coherent Population Oscillations eﬀect allows to burn a narrow spectral
hole (26 Hz) within the homogeneous absorption line of the optical transition of an Erbium
ion-doped crystal. The large dispersion of the index of refraction associated with this hole
permits to achieve a group velocity as low as 2.7 m/s with a transmission of 40 %. We es-
pecially beneﬁt from the inhomogeneous absorption broadening of the ions to tune both the
transmission coeﬃcient, from 40 % to 90 %, and the light group velocity from 2.7 m/s to
100 m/s.

Reduction of the optical group velocity by several orders of magnitude relatively to the speed

of light propagating in vacuum was demonstrated in recent years in diverse media among which

Bose-Einstein condensate, cold atoms [1, 2], vapors [3, 4] and solids [5, 6, 7, 8]. In addition to the

strangeness of producing light propagating at speeds as low as few m/s, Slow Light Propagation

(SLP) is at the very heart of new fundamental and applied ﬁelds of research in nonlinear and

quantum optics. From the nonlinear optical side, SLP allows to strongly enhance the light-

matter interaction time. Moreover, this interaction time can be continuously tuned to produce

optical buﬀers and variable delay lines for optical networks. From the quantum optical point

of view, SLP should allow, under speciﬁc conditions, classical and quantum properties of an

electromagnetic ﬁeld to be mapped into an atomic system [10]. The fundamental physical idea

at the origin of SLP is the creation of a very narrow spectral hole in the homogeneous absorption

proﬁle. As stipulated by Kramers-Kr¨onig relations, this narrow spectral hole is accompanied

by a strong dispersion of the index of refraction inducing a low group velocity and an increase

of the transmission. These two aspects are crucial in the choice of the atomic system and the

coherent interaction inducing SLP.

The ﬁrst direct demonstration of SLP [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] was achieved via Electromagnetically

Induced Transparency (EIT) [9]. It was originally implemented by applying a secondary control

ﬁeld to eliminate the linear absorption of a resonant probe ﬁeld through an otherwise absorbing

medium. The standard scheme for EIT is a three-level Λ system, where the probe ﬁeld drives

the system from one of the ground states and the control ﬁeld from the second ground state.

The width of the spectral hole burned in the homogeneous absorption proﬁle is proportional

to the inverse of the dephasing time of the ground state. Another physical eﬀect recently used

to reduce the speed of light to as low as few tens of meters per second is Coherent Population

Oscillations (CPO) [6, 7, 8]. In contrast to EIT, the CPO [11, 12] eﬀect is easily achieved in a

two-level system which is excited by a ”strong” pump ﬁeld Ep oscillating at ωp, along with a

weak probe ﬁeld Es oscillating at ωs = ωp + 2πδ. In this conﬁguration, the two-level system
population oscillates at the pump-probe beat frequency δ = (ωs − ωp)/2π. Such oscillations

become signiﬁcant when δ is less than 1/T1, where T1 is the relaxation lifetime of the excited

state. As a result a narrow spectral hole, whose width is proportional to 1/T1, is induced in the
homogeneous absorption proﬁle of the probe ﬁeld. M. S. Bigelow et al. [6] used this eﬀect in a

7.25-cm-long ruby crystal at room temperature to reduce the group velocity of light down to

57 m/s with a spectral hole width of 36 Hz and a rather low total transmission of about 0.1 %.
More recently, P.C. Ku et al. [8] showed in GaAs/AlGaAs semiconductor quantum wells a high

transmission of about 50 % for a group velocity of 9600 m/s. Though this value is low compared
to the speed of light in vacuum, it is still limited by the rather short relaxation time T1 ∼ 1 ns.

In this letter, we report on SLP induced by the CPO eﬀect in a crystal insulator doped

with rare-earth ions. Thanks to the long-lived excited state of the ions which is at the origin of

the very narrow spectral hole and of the steep dispersion of the refraction index, we successfully

achieved ultraslow light propagation in a solid-state material. The corresponding group velocities

are comparable to those achieved in SLP via EIT in a Bose-Einstein condensate [1, 2]. The

optical intensities we use are as weak as the intensities concerned in Ref. [1, 2] and are orders

of magnitude weaker than those used in Ref. [6, 8] for SLP via the CPO eﬀect. In contrast to

Ref. [6, 7, 8], we investigate in details the inﬂuence of the power and the absorption coeﬃcient on

the SLP. More importantly, we show that the inhomogeneous broadening inherent to rare-earth

ion-doped crystals, constitutes an additional control parameter we are able to manipulate to

tune both the group velocity and the transmission coeﬃcient.

The crystal used in our experiments is supplied by Scientiﬁc Materials Inc., and it consists in
an Yttrium oxyorthosilicate (Y2SiO5) lattice doped with 0.05 at. % of 167Er3+ ions. The optical
transition between the fundamental state 4I15/2 and the excited state 4I13/2 of the Erbium ions
is at 1536.1 nm. The crystal temperature is maintained at 1.5 K in a liquid Helium cryostat in

order to reduce the homogeneous linewidth to the sub-MHz level. However, due to the static

electric ﬁeld strength in the crystal an inhomogeneous broadening of about Γinh = 1.3 GHz is

present and prevents from the direct measurement of the homogeneous spectral line. Using the

spectral hole burning method, we measure the lifetime T1 of the excited state to be 8 ms. Photon

echo technique is used to measure the dephasing time T2 which is found to be about 3 µs at

1.5 K, a rather short value in comparison with T1.

From the theoretical point of view, the pump beam allows to selectively excite a narrow

portion of ions within the inhomogeneous line: those in resonance with the pump frequency.

Such ensemble of ions can be described by the formalism developed in Ref. [6, 11], where a two-
level system is driven by Epe−ıωpt + Ese−ıωst with ωs = ωp ± 2πδ. Following the mathematical

analysis in Ref. [6, 11], expressions of the absorption α(δ) and the index of refraction n(δ) are

derived for T2 << T1 from the oﬀ diagonal density matrix elements oscillating at δ,

The diﬀerent parameters involved in Eqs. (1) and (2) are the saturation parameter S deﬁned

as the ratio of the pump intensity and the saturation intensity and the unsaturated absorption

coeﬃcient α◦ of the two-level system. The Half Width at Half Maximum (HWHM) of the

spectral hole induced by the CPO eﬀect is theoretically given by

where we use the fact that n ≃ n0 + (ωp/2π)∂n/∂δ.

According to Eq. (3), the width of the spectral hole associated with T1 = 8 ms is expected to

be of the order of few Hz. In this case, the frequency of the probe ﬁeld is so close to the pump

frequency that the observation of the narrow spectral hole is prevented by the relative frequency

ﬂuctuations of the pump and the probe laser sources. However, it is possible to overcome this

problem by generating both the pump and the probe ﬁelds from a single laser source whose

intensity is modulated at a frequency δ with a 1 + m cos(2πδt) wave function, where m < 1 is

the modulation depth. Indeed, the strong mean value of the modulated laser signal plays the
role of the pump whereas the Fourier sidebands of the modulation at ±δ act as the weak probe.

Such an approach has been successfully used in Ref. [6, 7].

The scheme of our experimental setup is depicted in Fig. 1. The light source we use is a 2-kHz

linewidth, continuous-wave ﬁber laser emitting at 1536.1 nm. The combination of the half-wave

plate HWP1 and the polarizing beamsplitter PBS allows to control the laser beam power. By

driving the rf power of an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) with a 1+m cos(2πδt) wave function,

a 10 % intensity modulation depth is applied to the ﬁrst order diﬀracted ﬁeld. After the AOM,

the beamsplitter BS allows to separate a reference beam from the main beam which is sent

through the crystal located in the cryostat. Thanks to a 250-mm lens in front of the cryostat,

the main beam is focused down to a waist of 540 µm in the 3-mm long crystal. The main and

the reference beams are then detected using InGaAs photodiodes. The AC components of the

photocurrents, proportional to the amplitude of the modulation, are demodulated using lock-in

ampliﬁers. They are then stored in a computer, simultaneously with the DC components, after

data sampling and data averaging over more than 10000 samples.

Figure 2 shows the measured delay τ of the weak sidebands for diﬀerent modulation frequen-

cies δ as a function of the pump power. The pump ﬁeld wavelength is tuned to the maximum of

the absorption in the inhomogeneous proﬁle. The continuous lines are the plots of the theoretical

expression Eq. (4) of the delay, where T1=8 ms, L=3 mm. The unsaturated absorption coeﬃ-
cient at the maximum of the inhomogeneous line, α◦ = 6.5 cm−1, is determined by measuring

the linear absorption in the crystal of a weak laser beam as a function of its wavelength. Care is

taken in tuning the frequency of the laser over few GHz (> Γinh) within a suﬃciently short time

scale (5 ms) in order to avoid any saturation eﬀect. As shown in Fig. 2, the delay τ tends to zero

in the low pump power limit, S << 1, because the number of the excited ions is still not enough

to induce the coherent eﬀect. When the pump power is increased, S >> 1, the delay τ decreases

as well because of the absorption saturation: the number of the excited ions contributing to the

CPO eﬀect is reduced and the spectral hole is power-broadened leading to a less sharp disper-
sion. The discrepancy between theory and experiment when S >> 1 1 is probably due to the

inhomogeneous broadening [12]. Indeed, it modiﬁes the saturation behavior of the Erbium ions

with respect to that of the homogeneously broadened two-level system considered in the model.
A maximum delay τmax is reached for an optimum value of S(δ) independent on α◦. It is S ≃ 1/2

max = 1.04 ms derived

at δ = 10 Hz which is in a good agreement with the theoretical value τ the

from Eq. (4). The delay τ exp
max is obtained for a pump power of 12 µW measured in front of the
cryostat which corresponds to an intensity of 2.1 mW/cm2 on the crystal. In the following, we

will work at this particular pump intensity in order to maximize the CPO eﬀect. This intensity is
rather low in comparison with former CPO experiments [6, 7, 8] where ∼ kW/cm2 are required,

and is comparable to the intensities involved in SLP in Bose-Einstein condensate [1, 2]. The

max is 2.7±0.2 m/s. To our knowledge, it is the
slowest group velocity ever achieved in a solid. Indeed, according to our results, we reduce the
group velocity by a factor ng = c/vg = 108. In comparison, the reduction is less than 5 × 106 in
the Ruby and Alexandrite crystals [6, 7] and about 104 in the semiconductor quantum wells [8].

In order to determine the linewidth of the narrow spectral hole which is at the origin of

the large dispersion of the refraction index and hence of the SLP, we measure the delay as

well as the transmission of the weak sidebands as a function of the modulation frequency (the

squares in Fig. 3). Like in the previous measurement, the wavelength of the pump is tuned to

the maximum of the absorption. The inset in Fig. 3 is the transmission of the weak sidebands

normalized to the transmission that is observed in a hole burning experiment. Indeed, a spectral

hole is burned by the pump ﬁeld in the inhomogeneous transmission proﬁle of the probe ﬁeld.

Due to CPO eﬀect, an additional increase of the transmission is observed when δ is smaller than

1/T1. This increase is about 55 % at δ= 10 Hz. At frequencies δ larger than 1/T1, the eﬀect of

CPO becomes negligible. The continuous lines in Fig. 3 are the theoretical plots derived from

Eq. (1) and Eq. (4) without adjustable parameters. We can deduce from the inset in Fig. 3 a

26-Hz HWHM of the spectral hole, which is rather close to the theoretical value of 30 Hz.

One of the fundamental point we are addressing in this letter is the experimental exploration

and exploitation of the dependance of the group velocity reduction on the absorption coeﬃcient.

Figure 4: The experimental group velocity (continuous line), pump (dashed line) and probe
(dotted line) transmissions as a function of the pump frequency. The modulation frequency δ is
ﬁxed at 10 Hz and the pump power is such that S =1/2.

Indeed, unlike the other materials that have been investigated up to now [6, 7, 8], our crys-

tal shows an inhomogeneous absorption broadening. By tuning the pump frequency over this

inhomogeneous proﬁle, we are able to address diﬀerent Erbium ions concentrations and hence

diﬀerent absorption coeﬃcients.

In Fig. 4, the continuous line represents the measured light

group velocity as a function of the pump frequency detuning relative to the pump wavelength at

the maximum of the absorption. We also plot the transmission of the pump ﬁeld (dashed line) as

well as the transmission of the probe ﬁeld (dotted line). The frequency of the probe is detuned

by δ = 10 Hz from the pump frequency. The shape followed by the group velocity is similar

to that of the transmission, clearly indicating the dependance of vg on the absorption strength

in the Erbium-doped crystal. However, a careful analysis of the results shows that vg is not

proportional to the inverse of the absorption. This might be due to the inhomogeneous broad-

ening. From the practical point of view, Fig. 4 indicates that the inhomogeneous broadening is

an additional parameter which allows the engineering of the group velocity. Indeed, thanks to

the inhomogeneous broadening in our crystal, vg can easily be varied from 3 m/s to 100 m/s by

tuning the pump wavelength. The highest SLP is achieved at the maximum of the absorption

with a probe transmission of 40 %. Moreover, an important reduction of the group velocity is

still obtained for high probe transmission. For example, when the relative pump frequency is

set at 2 GHz (see Fig. 4), a group velocity of 58 m/s is measured with a transmission of about

value.

It is worth noting that the delay τ is proportional to the product α◦T1L. Consequently, the

reduction of the group velocity ng varies like the product α◦T1c. The slowest light propagation

will be then obtained in long-lived atomic systems with high absorption coeﬃcient. However,
in order to obtain a non negligible transmission, T ∼ e−α◦L, one has to compensate for the

large coeﬃcient α◦ by choosing a short medium. It is for example possible to obtain a 88 %

transmission in the Erbium-doped crystal with the lowest group velocity, 3 m/s, by using a
crystal having a thickness of about 200 µm pumped at the maximum of the absorption proﬁle 2.

This means that transparency can be reached while keeping the group velocity at its minimum

In conclusion, the implementation of CPO in Erbium-doped crystals enables to achieve ultra

SLP. The pump intensities involved are six order of magnitude smaller than in former CPO

experiments [6, 7, 8] and comparable to the one involved in EIT in ultracold atomic gas [1, 2].

We demonstrate that the inhomogeneous broadening, an inherent eﬀect of the crystalline matrix,

does not degrade the slow light propagation eﬀect. It can instead be used to spectrally tune both

the slow light propagation eﬀect and the transmission. Group velocities ranging from 3 m/s to

100 m/s are achieved with transmission eﬃciencies ranging from 40% to 90%.

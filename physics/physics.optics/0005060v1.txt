We propose a four-level model where sub-Doppler resolution as well as enhanced absorption of a
weak probe ﬁeld are realized by using two coherently driving ﬁelds. We show that spectral resolution
can be improved by modifying the coherent ﬁelds intensity and frequencies.

I. INTRODUCTION

Multi-photon transitions are embedded in a variety of optical eﬀects based on correlated absorption and emission

of two or more photons. Step-wise and multi-photon processes can be distinguished by their frequency-correlation

properties [1,2]. Sub-Doppler resolution for an inhomogeneously broadened medium based on multi-photon processes

has attracted much attention in recent decades. The physical essence for this method lies in the fact that a detuning for

multi-photon transition stipulated by Doppler frequency shift can be reduced or eliminated by adopting appropriate

light propagation direction, since the detuning is the sum or diﬀerence of multiple single-photon transition detunings.

Sub-Doppler nonlinear optical resonance as appearance of quantum coherence and interference in the context of

frequency-correlation properties of the coherent components have been proposed in [3]. A widely used method is

Doppler-free two- or multi-photon absorption where the velocity dependent detuning could be removed in the case

that the wave vectors of the interacting beams sum down to zero (for a review, see [4]). This type of sub-Doppler

spectrum is characterized by a large detuning from the intermediate resonance, measuring the ﬂuorescence from the

upper level as well as by small cross sections for these multi-photon processes. Enhanced by intermediate resonance

sub-Doppler processes based on the use of strong driving ﬁelds and on a change of frequency-correlation properties

of resonant multi-photon process in strong resonant ﬁelds, have been proposed in [3] and further developed in [5,6]

(also in [2]). Substantial enhancement in absorption, gain and ﬂuorescence controlled with the auxiliary appropriately

propagating electro-magnetic wave has been predicted. An interference nature of the spectrum modiﬁcation has been

stressed, which implies that along the growth of the absorption (gain) in certain spectral intervals, integral over the

frequency may even decrease. A role of increase of intensity of a probe ﬁeld as well as features of Doppler-free lasers

were explored too.

Control of atomic response with intense coupling lasers has been a subject of many intensive studies in the context

of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) [7], ampliﬁcation without inversion (AWI) [8–11], enhancement

of the refractive index without absorption [12] and so on (for review see [8,11,13]). Sub-Doppler resolution by using

intense coherently driving ﬁeld(s) at other transition(s) has been recently further explored in [14,15]. In Ref. [14] probe

1

weak ﬁeld absorption spectrum in three-level schemes was considered. It was pointed out that the linewidth of one

of the two Autler-Townes absorption peaks can be reduced by match of the coupling ﬁeld intensity and frequency. In

a later work [15], an experimental observation of steady-state sub-Doppler linewidth in a Doppler-broadened Λ-type

Rb atomic system was reported. Related works to reduce Doppler broadening with atomic coherence eﬀects could be

found in Ref. [16] and multiple sub-Doppler lines have been shown to achieve through a strong coupling ﬁeld and a

saturation eﬀects in a three-level system [17].

In the recent papers [18], cancellation of Doppler broadening by applying diﬀerent frequency ﬁelds was proposed

with one or two coherently driving lasers. As it has been outlined, sub-Doppler structures can be induced without

population redistribution. At that not only absorption and gain, but four-wave mixing output can be enhanced

through Doppler-free coupling controlled with auxiliary co- or counter-propagating driving electromagnetic radiation.

In this paper, we propose a four-level scheme, where both upper and lower levels of a probe transition are coupled

with other levels via strong coherent ﬁelds. In this scheme, four absorption peaks could be found on account of the

fact that both the upper and lower states are split into Autler-Townes doublets. Sub-Doppler resolution is achievable

because the modiﬁed two-photon transition occurs contributing in the probe process and two-photon detunings,

resulting from the Doppler shift, could be reduced by choosing appropriate optical geometry. A crucial role of the

ratio of the frequencies of the coupled transitions is outlined. The results obtained on the basis of the developed

theory are accompanied with numerical simulation addressed to real experimental schemes. Despite the decreased

integral intensity, we predict enhanced laser-induced sub-Doppler absorption peaks along with transparency windows.

The features are interpreted in the terms of quantum coherence and interference processes.

The paper is organized into four sections.

In the next section, we present a four-level model and the density-

matrix equations describing the system. The solution in the limit of a weak probe and steady-state condition is

obtained and the absorption spectrum is then analyzed, ﬁrst without Doppler broadening. In Sec. III, taking into

consideration Doppler broadening, we demonstrate that the multiple sub-Doppler lines as well as enhanced absorption

at the resonance could be obtained in this scheme. From numerical illustrations of the eﬀect in a practical medium,

the conditions for and features of Doppler-free resonance, stipulated by compensation of Doppler shifts with light

shifts are discussed. In Sec. IV, we summarize the results.

II. MODEL AND ABSORPTION SPECTRUM AT HOMOGENEOUSLY BROADENED PROBE

TRANSITION

We consider a closed four-level scheme shown in Fig. 1(a). In this scheme two coherent driving ﬁelds Ec and Ed

with Rabi frequencies Ωc = −Ec · d13/2¯h and Ωd = −Ed · d24/2¯h interact with the transitions labeled |4i − |2i and
|3i − |1i, respectively. The transition |4i − |1i is probed by the weak nonperturbating ﬁeld Ep. Absorption index αp

corresponding dressed susceptibility. The later is convenient to calculate with aid of dressed nonlinear polarization

P N L and density matrix ρij as P N L(ω4) = N χ4E4/2 = N ρij dji (dji is transition electrodipole moment, N - number

density of atoms). In the framework of semi- classical theory and using the standard density matrix formalism with

the rotating wave approximation, the description equations of this scheme can be written in general form as:

Lnnρnn = qn − i[V, ρ]nn +Pm>n γmnρmm; L14ρ14 = Lpρp = −i[V, ρ]14 (etc.),

(2.1)

where Lij = d/dt + Γij;

V14 = Ωp · exp{i∆pt}; Ωp = −Ep · d14/2¯h; ∆p = ωp − ω41 (etc.) are frequency detunings
from the corresponding resonance; Γij - homogeneous half-widths of transitions (in absence of collisions Γmn =

- rate of incoherent exitation to a state n from the underlying levels.

(Γm + Γn)/2); Γn =Pj γnj - inverse lifetimes of levels; γmn - rate of relaxation from the level m to n, qn =Pj wnj rj
We represent density matrix elements as ρ14 = rp · exp{i∆pt}, ρ33 = r3 etc. Then in a steady-state regime a set of
density-matrix equation may be reduced to the set of algebraic equations for the amplitudes rij . Analytical solution

of this system of 10 coupled equation both for closed and open four-level scheme is given in [11,20]. In the case under

consideration incoherent exitation of the upper levels as well as relaxation from the level 3 to 2 are supposed to be

negligible small. Then r2 = r4 = rc = 0 and equation system (2.1) reduces to

Pprp = iΩpr1 + ir12Ωc − iΩdr34, P12r12 = irpΩ∗

The denominator in (2.7) displays two resonances. At Ωc → 0 we obtain δ1 → 0 + iΓp, δ2 → ∆c + iΓ12. This indicates
one resonance at ∆p = 0, the HWHM is Γp, which corresponds to one-photon resonance with no correlation with ωc

(M1 = dδ1/d∆c = 0). The second resonance at ∆p = ∆c is of HWHM Γ12 that corresponds to two-photon resonance,

fully correlated with ωc (M2 = dδ2/d∆c = 1). With growth of the coupling Rabi frequency Ωc the resonance becomes
split in two component, their frequency-correlation properties modify, and M1 ≈ M2 ≈ 1/2 at |Ωc|2 ≫ {|∆c|2, Γ2
p,12},
which neither correspond to one- nor to two-photon processes. HWHM of the resonances becomes also nearly equal

to each other and to (Γ12 + Γp)/2. Note that the eﬀects are determined by the coherence ρ12 induced in the transition

|1i − |2i, and that always M1 + M2 = 1. More detailed discussion can be found in [1–3,18].

In the alternative case Ωc = 0 all vi = 0 and the equation (2.6) reduces to:

(Γp + i∆p)[Γ34 + i(∆p − ∆d)] + |Ωd|2

(cid:27) .

(2.10)

The structure of the denominator is similar to (2.7) and determined by the coherence ρ34. Additional term in the

nominator is stipulated by the coherence induced at the transition |1i−|3i with the not zero populations of the levels
unlike the transition |2i − |4i. This term is a source of the nonlinear interference eﬀects (NIEF) in absorption (gain)
and refraction. Speciﬁc features of NIEF in coupled Doppler broadened Λ, V and ladder schemes were explored in

[2,19]. It has been outlined that frequency integrated absorption index is proportional to r1 − r4 only, i.e. it’s change
is determined only by the population change. As it was ﬁrst outlined in [8,19], indeed NIEF give rise to diﬀerence

in the line shapes of pure absorption and emission spectra. As the consequence of this eﬀect, the appearance of

ampliﬁcation without inversion on the base of NIEF has been predicted. The features of the ampliﬁcation without

inversion were analyzed and illustrated for the model of neon transitions in the early publication [8].

Speciﬁc feature of the case under consideration in this paper is that both of the levels of the probe transition can

be driven independently. This gives rise to multiple resonance structure, corresponding to the roots of denominator

in (2.6). If resonance splitting is much greater than their widths, we can set Γij = 0, and the resonance values of ∆p

are described by the equation:

[∆p − ∆d − ∆c][∆p(∆p − ∆d)(∆p − ∆c) − (∆p − ∆c)Ω2

c] −

− ∆p[(∆p − ∆d)Ω2

d + (∆p − ∆c)Ω2

c] + (Ω2

d − Ω2

c )2 = 0.

(2.11)

Basically, this equation possesses four roots, that indicates appearance of four nonlinear resonances, determined by

splitting of each of the levels |1i and |4i into two quasi levels.

In the case ∆d = −∆c = ∆ resonance positions are given by the equation:

At |Ωd| = |Ωc| = |Ω| two resonances merge in one not shifted resonance at ∆(1)

p = 0, the other two resonances are

given by

∆(2,3)

p

= ±√∆2 + 4Ω2.

In the case ∆d = ∆c = 0 resonance positions are found as:

∆(1,2)

(2.13)

(2.14)

We begin our discussion with the case when the Doppler-broadening is not included. Performing numerical calcula-

tion for Eq. (6), we depict the absorption proﬁles in Fig.2. From Fig. 2(a) and 2(b), it is easy to ﬁnd the typical EIT

and absorption spectrum with |Ωd| = 0 (Fig. 2(a)) and |Ωc| = 0 (Fig.2(b)). Under increasing Rabi frequency |Ωc|
(|Ωd|), the four-peak spectrum forms, when the driving ﬁelds become comparable to or larger than the spectral width
Γp of the atomic transition. The emergence of the four-peak spectrum is attributed to the fact that levels |1i and
|4i have been driven into two dressed states (Fig. 1). As |Ωd| approaches |Ωc|, the four-peak spectrum degenerates
into a three-peak spectrum since two dressed-state transitions have the same resonant frequency and contribute to

the same central component. As already known, a three-peak spectrum occurs in resonance ﬂuorescence (RF) in the

strong ﬁeld limit of a two-level system (for a review, see [1]). Even though the dressed-state diagrams are similar in

the two cases, the four-peak spectrum can not appear in RF because in the case of RF the dynamic Stark splitting

for the two doublets must be the same, while in our system the two doublet splittings are controlled separately by

diﬀerent driving ﬁeld intensity and frequency. We would like to stress that the multiple EIT windows can appear

simultaneously with the multiple absorption peaks. In Fig. 2(c), the absorption amplitude A at ∆p = 0 is plotted

against the Rabi frequencies for two resonant driving ﬁelds. An important feature is that the maximum absorption

occurs under the condition that the two Rabi frequencies are equal, which is due to the fact that the two dressed-state

transitions simultaneously contribute to the central component. This result may provide a way to measure the ﬁeld

intensity as well as atomic parameters. In the following Section, we will proceed to analyze the absorption spectrum

under eﬀects of Doppler-broadening.

III. COHERENCE INDUCED RESONANCES IN DOPPLER-BROADENED MEDIUM OF SODIUM

DIMERS

In the previous sections, Doppler broadening has not been accounted for. In order to consider this eﬀect, Doppler

shifts must be introduced in the three interacting ﬁeld resonance detunings in Eq. (2.6).

We shall illustrate major outcomes of the paper with numerical simulations addressed to the conditions of the

experiment [21]. Transitions |1i − |3i − |2i − |4i − |1i in Fig.1a are attributed to those of the sodium dimers N a2:

about 450 C is 2Dp ≈ 1.7 GHz. Then the Boltzmann’s population of the level |2i makes about 1.5% from that of the
level |1i. The following relaxation parameters are used: Γ4 = 200, Γ2 = 30, Γ3 = 260, γ42 = 2, γ41 = 4, γ32 = 20,
γ31 = 10, Γ12 = 40, Γc = 110, Γp = 110, Γ34 = 130, Γ23 = 140, Γd = 140, (all in 106 s−1). For numerical simulation

we have used the full set of the equations from [11,20], accounting for various relaxation transitions and not zero

population of the level |2i.

Fig. 3 depicts absorption spectrum for the molecules with the velocity projection on the propagation direction of

the coupled ﬁelds v = 0. The plots illustrate dependencies, described by the equations (2.12) - (2.14). The appearance

of the four-peak spectrum is attributed to the fact that levels |1i and |4i have been driven into two dressed states.
Direct computing shows that frequency integral absorption for the plot 3 is the same as for 5, whereas for the other

plots it is about 0.5 of that for the graph 5. This is due to strong saturation of population diﬀerence at the transition

|1i – |3i.

Figure 4 displays same dependencies, but for velocity averaged absorption index and co-propagating probe and

driving ﬁelds. While number of peaks and their positions are identical to the previous case, the speciﬁc feature of

the inhomogeneous broadening is that plot 1 displays enhanced absorption in the central component despite the fact

that integral intensity of this graph is about 2 times less than that for the plot 4 (due to the strong saturation of

the populations at the transition |1i – |3i). In absence of driving ﬁelds only small fraction of the molecules (about
Γp/Dp ≈ 10−3) can be coupled by probe ﬁeld. Overlap of the two dressed transitions gives rise to increased amount
of the molecules coupled with the probe ﬁeld and consequently to enhanced absorption as compared to not perturbed

absorption in the center of Doppler broadened transition.

As it was shown in [3], resonance requirements for molecules at velocity v and at max{|Ωd|2, ∆d|2} ≫ kdu (u is

thermal velocity, kd - wave number) are described by the equation

∆p − kpv = δ1,2 − M1,2kdv.

(3.1)

The equation indicates that cancellation of Doppler shifts is possible even at kp 6= kd, if kp < kd. This is due to the
interplay of the Doppler and ac Stark shifts giving rise to variation of M1 in the interval 0...1/2, whereas M2 – in the

interval 1...1/2. Possible enhancements of cross-section of optical processes through concurrent coupling of molecules

from wide velocity interval by means of the above outlined approach are shown in Fig. 5. The frequencies of the

probe and Ed ﬁelds are interchanged (see Fig. 1b), all other relaxation parameters remain the same. Plot 1 displays

enhanced sub-Doppler resonances with the FWHM comparable with the natural linewidth (see insets (a),(b))for co-

propagating wave. Dramatic change as compared to similar graphs in Fig. 5 is explicitly seen. The other plots

show evolution of the structures with variation of the intensity of one of the driving ﬁeld. As plot 4 indicates, the

sub-Doppler structures exist only under certain ratio of the driving ﬁeld intensities. Even more dramatic change

occurs while driving ﬁelds (especially shorter wavelength one) are counter propagating (see inset (c)).

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have explored spectral properties of the molecular transitions in the case that both upper and

lower levels are coupled to other atomic levels and Doppler eﬀects play important role. The features of the four-peak

or three-peak spectra induced by the driving ﬁelds are investigated. Despite the dominated Doppler-broadening, two

or more peaks may possess the sub-Doppler resolusion. A crucial role of the ratio of the frequencies of the coupled

transition is shown. With manipulation the detunings and/or intensities of two coupling ﬁelds, one can improve the

spectral resolution. The enhanced absorption in the sub-Doppler peak is shown to be realized, whereas the peak

can be induced in the center of the inhomogeneously broadened transition. The predicted eﬀects are attributed to

the quantum coherence and interference processes, while frequency-correlation properties of multi-photon processes

experience substantial modiﬁcation with the growth of the driving ﬁelds intensities, which leads to corresponding

dramatic changes of the role of Doppler eﬀects.

The similar sub-Doppler technique can also be implemented for other atomic coherence eﬀects, such as EIT, LWI

and for enhancing various resonant nonlinear optical phenomena in inhomogeneously broadened media. In one of our

previous papers [22], the inversionless ampliﬁcation has been considered with the important feature that incoherent

excitation to the upper level is not necessary in the same scheme as considered in this letter. Similar scheme is

often used in quantum optics. Most recently, electromagnetically induced absorption was studied in a similar four-

level system [23]. We believe that, by utilizing this sub-Doppler technique, the above eﬀects in inhomengeneously

broadened media can be further enhanced and manipulated.

FIG. 1. The energy level schemes under consideration.

FIG. 2. Absorption spectrum at homogeneously broadened probe transition |1i − |4i controlled with two driving ﬁeld. αp
– absorption index, reduced by it’s resonant value at both driving ﬁelds being turned oﬀ. The atomic parameters used are:
Γ31 = Γp; Γ43 = 2Γp; Γ21 = 0.1Γp; Γ42 = Γp. We choose ∆c = ∆d = 0. (a) |Ωc| = 5Γp. (b) |Ωd| = 5Γp. (c) ∆p = 0.

FIG. 3. Absorption spectrum at homogeneously broadened probe transition |1i−|4i (for molecules at velocity v=0) controlled
with two driving ﬁeld. α4 – absorption index, reduced by it’s resonant value at both driving ﬁelds being turned oﬀ, ∆p = ωp−ω41
– resonance detuning of the week probe ﬁeld. Detunings of both driving ﬁelds ∆d = ωd − ω31 = ∆c = ωc − ω42 = 0; coupling
Rabi frequencies are as follows: 1 – (dash-dot) Ωd = 120 MHz, Ωc = 200 MHz; 2 – (solid) Ωd = Ωc = 120 MHz; 3 – (dash)
Ωd = 0, Ωc = 120 MHz; 4 – (dot) Ωd = 120 MHz, Ωc = 0; 5 – (solid) Ωd = Ωc = 0.

FIG. 4. Absorption spectrum at inhomogeneously broadened probe transition |1i − |4i (Fig. 1a) controlled with two driving
ﬁeld. All ﬁelds are co-propagating, α4 – velocity averaged absorption index, reduced by it’s resonant value at both driving
ﬁelds being turned oﬀ. The other notations are the same as in Fig. 3. ∆d = ∆c = 0, Ωc = 1 GHz, Ωd – as follows: 1 – (solid)
Ωd = 1 GHz; 2 – (dash) Ωd = 0.7 GHz; 3 – (dot) Ωd = 0.3 GHz; 4 – (solid)– Ωc = Ωd = 0.

FIG. 5. Compensation of residual Doppler broadening and sub-Doppler structures at the probe transition |1i − |4i (Fig. 1b)
coherently driven with two strong ﬁelds. Main plot – all ﬁelds are co-propagating, 1 – 3 — all parameters and notations are
the same as in Fig. 4. 4 – (dash-dot): Ωd = 0.075 GHz. Insets (a) and (b) are corresponding zoomed peaks. Inset (c) — same
as plot 1 but: 1 — only ﬁeld c is counter propagating; 2 — only ﬁeld d is counter propagating; 3 — both driving ﬁelds are
counter-propagating in respect to the probe ﬁeld.

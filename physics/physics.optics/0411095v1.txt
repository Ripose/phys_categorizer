This paper presents an investigation of organic LED extraction eﬃciency enhancement using a
low refractive index scattering layer. A scattering model is developed based on rigorous electromag-
netic modelling techniques. The model accounts for proportions of scattered guided and radiation
modes as well as the eﬃciencies with which emitted and scattered light are extracted. Constrained
optimisation techniques are implemeneted for a single operation wavelength to maximise the extrac-
tion eﬃciency of a generic OLED device. Calculations show that a 2 fold eﬃciency enhancement is
achievable with a correctly engineered scattering layer. The detailed analysis of the enhancement
mechanism highlights ways in which this scheme could be improved.

INTRODUCTION

An important consideration in the design of any opto-
electronic device is the eﬃciency with which light can be
extracted. A fundamental limitation on all light emitting
materials with refractive indices greater than the collec-
tion medium is that light emitted outside the critical an-
gle with respect to the collection medium will be trapped
by total internal reﬂection. One successful approach that
overcomes this problem is to texture the surface of de-
vices so that trapped light can be scattered into the crit-
ical angle of extraction [1, 2, 3]. This approach works
well for inorganic devices where the scattering surface is
In organic based
very close to the emission region [1].
LEDs the textured surface is generally separated from
the emission zone by the thickness of the substrate (
1
mm). Although light trapped in the substrate can be
extracted [5], the most signiﬁcant improvements require
high refractive index substrates that are matched to the
emission region [2]. Introducing wavelength size textur-
ing closer to the active layers is generally not feasible as
this would compromise the device’s electrical properties.
The use of a microcavity to redistribute emission geo-
metrically has been demonstrated in both organic [6] and
inorganic material systems [4, 7, 8]. Despite their eﬀec-
tiveness, microcavities only provide enhancement over a
limited spectral range and are signiﬁcantly more elabo-
rate in design. A more recent demonstration has shown
that low refractive index hydrophobic aerogel materials
can be used to successfully enhance extraction eﬃciency
in organic based LEDs [9].
In this approach, trapped
light from an emitting region (n = 1.8) is encouraged
to couple evanescently through the higher index Indium
Tin Oxide (ITO) anode (nIT O
1.9) to a thick aerogel
layer (n < 1.1). Angular resolved intensity enhancements

near a factor of 1.5 were reported; likely to be less in
terms of actual power enhancement. A theoretical study
of volumetric light scattering in such low refractive in-
dex substrates shows that signiﬁcant improvements can
result in combining these two enahcnement mechanisms
[5]. Here a similar approach is examined which combines
the successful texturing / scattering approache with the
use of low refractive index layers. A scattering layer,
consisting of high refractive index dielectric spheres em-
bedded in a low refractive index material, is placed be-
side the anode of an organic device as depicted in Fig. 1.
This is possible because of the surface ﬂatness and uni-
formity of the scattering layer, developed by Mitsubishi
Chemicals Corporation, that does not interfere with the
electrical properties of the device. The distance between
the emission region and this layer is comparable to the
wavelength of light allowing eﬃcient scattering of low or-
der guided modes that constitute a large proportion of
trapped light. Scattered light is eﬀectively redistributed
within the lower refractive index medium from where it
can be extracted with greater eﬃciency.

Consider the channels through which emission is ex-
tracted or trapped within the device. Light originates
via spontaneous emission from the emission region in ei-
ther radiation modes which can escape the device with
eﬃciency, ηc(λ), or guided modes that are trapped,
ηc(λ)). Proportions of radiation, γR(λ), and guided,
(1
γG(λ), modes are then redistributed into the same set of
radiation and guided modes inside the scattering layer.
Scattered radiation modes are extracted from the scat-
tering layer with eﬃciency ηs(λ). Figure 1 identiﬁes the
6 emission channels whose descriptions and resulting ef-
ﬁciencies are given below.

ting and scattering layers respectively. The eﬃciency en-
hancement of the device is summarised by Eqns. (1) and
(2): The LHS must be maximised while the RHS must
be minimised. Minimisation of the RHS of Eqns. (1) and
(2) is achieved by reducing ns with respect to nc. Choice
of a material with as low a refractive index as possible is
clearly required. The LHS of Eqns. (1) and (2) is max-
imised by ensuring that guided modes are scattered more
eﬀectively than radiation modes.

duced in Eqns. (1) and (2) are evaluated using rigorous
electromagnetic methods. The focus of these calculations
centres on the treatment of guided mode scattering as
this is the crucial component of the optimisation scheme.

In the following study, a simpliﬁed generic OLED de-
sign is investgated. The aim is to make rigorous cal-
culations of the parameters discussed in the preceeding
section in order to obtain better estimates of the mer-
its of the eﬃcinecy enhancement strategy. Table I gives
the refractive indices and layer thicknesses for a typical
OLED device. The basic structure of the device has been
optimised to enhance the extraction of radiation modes

to the scattering layer will be investigated by controlling
three parameters, speciﬁed in Table I. The parameters
are the scattering layer thickness ds, refractive index ns
and the hole conduction layer thickness, dh. During the
optimisation, the scattering coeﬃcient, αs, is kept con-
stant. Currently, Mitsubishi have successfully engineered
scattering layers with αsds = 0.33 so αs = 0.33/ds. The
constrained optimisation problem is formally stated in

Here, the objective function is the eﬃciency from a
ﬁrst order scattering enhancement. Although multiple
scattering has been considered later in the report, intro-
ducing it in the objective function seriously increases the
computation time of local solutions. A global solution
was determined by successive optimisation searches us-
ing distributed starting points spanning the parameter
space. A total of 125 device conﬁgurations were consid-
ered resulting in three local maximum solutions. The
global maximum solution is shown in Table I and is used
throughout the paper.

The operation of optical devices in the spontaneous
emission regime involves spectral, spatial and angular
parameterisations. For example, Figure 2 (a) shows the
electric ﬁeld intensity at normal incidence and 30◦ for the
Transverse Electric (TE) polarisation within the device
at a wavelength of λ = 450 nm corresponding to blue
light. The strength of the optical ﬁeld and its overlap
with the emission zone of the device, highlighted by the
shaded area, determine the light extraction from the de-
vice. This is plotted as a function of angle in Fig. 2 (b).
This level of detail makes the analysis very complicated.

In the present study, the four eﬃciency parameters are
calculated by integrating over solid angles leaving only
the wavelength as the independent variable. This simpli-
ﬁes the problem greatly, but, it is important to remain
mindful of the internal angular and spatial variations. In
addition, the polarisation is eliminated from the study
by averaging over dipole orientations. For details of the
techniques and models incorporated here, the reader is
referred to Ref. 13.

Consider, the impact of the optimum solution on η(0)
:
Notice that interference eﬀects due to the large contrast
between the ITO and scattering layer will result in weak
cavity eﬀects that enhance ηc. This is observed in Fig. 2
(b), which shows that emission at 17.3◦ is preferred in
the optimised design. Lobed emission like this is a re-
sult of the weak cavity being detuned from the preset
wavelength of 450 nm. This is preferential as there is a
larger density of oﬀ-axis emission states [7]. The tuning
wavelength of the weak cavity is given approximately by
λ0 = 450/ cos θmax where θmax is the angle of maximum
emission. Here, λ0 = 456.3 nm.

Evidently, interference eﬀects are important in the de-
termination of this model component as the thickness
of the scattering layer is a multiple of λ0/4. Here,

B. Evaluation of the scattered light extraction
eﬃciency, ηs

The extraction eﬃciency of scattered light, ηs, can
be calculated provided the scattered light distribution
within the layer is known. Here, the distribution of scat-
tered light is assumed to be uniform. This is a good ap-
proximation provided scatterers are much smaller than
the wavelength of light. This can be shown for small
spherical dielectric scatterers using Mie theory [16].

Following a scattering event, light is collected from
the low refractive index layer. Since subsequent scat-
tering events are considered separately in Section III E,
the complex part of the scattering layer refractive index
is dropped for the calculation of ηs. Under these condi-
ions, ηs represents the upper limit on extraction from the
scattering layer. As expected from the discussion in the
introduction, the optimum choice of refractive index in
the scattering layer corresponds to the lower bound.

C. Evaluating the proportion of scattered radiation
mode power, γR

γR is a measure of the strength of radiation mode scat-
tering within the device. It is calculated by considering
the diﬀerence between a device with (αs
= 0) and with-
out (αs = 0) scattering. Where there is no scattering, the
extraction eﬃciency is η(0)
. With scattering, the zero or-

Therefore, γR is given by Eqn. (5).

D. Evaluating the proportion of scattered guided
mode power, γG.

The proportion of scattered guided modes, γG is eval-
uated by examining the internal ﬁelds of the device. De-
spite this, the calculation approach is similar to the eval-
uation of γR. The optical ﬁeld intensity,

for γG. Note that this does not take into account the
lateral extent of the device, although this will be consid-
ered shortly. Fig. 3 illustrates the relevant components
in these guided mode scattering calculations for the TE1
mode corresponding to a particular internal angle, θc. γG
is evaluated using the expression in Eqn 6 by integrating
over the internal emission solid angle, Ωc.

quite distinct: TE modes propagate away from the metal
interface in the dielectric with the highest refractive in-
dex, whereas TM modes propagate along the surface of
the metal. Absorption within the ITO region has an
equally profound eﬀect on both polarisations contribut-
ing signiﬁcantly to ks i. Fig. 5 highlights two speciﬁc
regions of interest: The electric ﬁeld intensity overlap
with the emission and scattering regions. It is evident
that the overlap of TM modes with the emitting region
is very poor in contrast to the TE modes explaining the
diﬀerent electric ﬁeld intensity y-axis scales in Figs. 4 (a)
and 4 (b). However, the overlap of the ﬁeld with the scat-
tering region is also critical as it indicating the strength
of guided mode scattering. The TE1 and TM1 have poor
overlaps with both the scattering layer and the emitting
region. In addition any emissive coupling to these mode
is purely evanescent since there critical angles are greater
than 90◦ with respect to the emission region. Only the
higher order TE2, TM2 and TM3 modes are required to
describe the mode scattering and absorption.

Close examination of the values in Tab. II shows that
absorption is stronger than the scattering. This is re-
ﬂected by the ﬁeld calculations which shows that γG

%. For laterally small devices some of the trapped light
may not be scattered or absorbed. Here, ks i and ka i, can
be used to estimate the distance a guided mode travels
before being fully scattered. The total mode attenuation
length, L, shown in Tab. II, is deﬁned as the distance
a mode travels before being scattered to e−1 of its orig-
inal intensity by scattering alone (i.e. calculated using
ks i). Typically, a device with a lateral size of the or-
der of 10 µm is large enough to maximise guided mode

The device eﬃciency due to ﬁrst order scattering can

be expressed as,

Mn and Cn are given by expressions similar to M1 and
M2, however, use the new model components γ(2)
G and
γ(2)
R to quantify the proportions of light that are scattered
a second time and subsequent time. These parameters
have been calculated using similar techniques to those
described in Sections III C and III D. In the case of the
optimisation calculation, where αsds = 0.33, multiple
scattering contributes 5 % of the eﬃciency.

IV. RESULTS.

So far the internal components of the calculations have
been examined in detail. Now consider the behaviour of
the model components as a function of the scattering
strength. The strength of scattering ultimately governs
the degree of mixing between the radiation and guided
modes of the device. As the scattering is increased, there
will also be an increase in enhancement factor of the un-
derlying device. This behaviour is seen in Fig. 6.

Fig. 6 (a) shows the variation of the model components
as a function of the scattering strength, αsds whose range
is extended to 0
1. The extraction eﬃciencies,
ηc and ηs are independent of the scattering strength. The
proportions of scattered guided and radiation modes in-
crease monotonically with the scattering strength and
diﬀer in magnitude by a factor g
1.25. Clearly, ra-
diation modes are scattered more strongly that guided
modes. This is a critical observation since to acquire the
greatest eﬃciency enhancement, this ratio must be min-
imised.

enhancement factor has been compared to the eﬃciency

In the absence of absorption, there is an enhancement

tions of this enhancement approach. The primary limita-
tions, in order of importance, are the extraction eﬃciency
from the low refractive index medium, ηs, the strength
of guided mode scattering, γ, and the ratio of radiation
to guided mode scattering, g. ηs must be maximised, re-
quiring a scattering layer with as low a refractive index
as possible. Here, the optimum value of ns = 1.1 is at
the lower bound of what can be achieved in the fabri-
cation process. Alternative materials such as aerogels,
which have refractive indices as low as 1.01 [9], would
show even larger enhancements. However, the choice of
material must be compatible with the formation of dielec-
tric spheres to provide the required scattering strength,
γ. Maximising γ allows the device to attain a larger frac-
tion of the limiting enhancement factor. Finally, the ratio
of guided to radiation modes, g must be minimised.

In Sec. III D the calculation of the guided mode scat-
tering component, γG, is detailed. The reader is there-
fore referred to this section for an in depth appraisal
of the factors that eﬀect the value of g. One of the
most signiﬁcant factors in the guided mode scattering
strength is the strong absorption in the high refractive in-
dex anode region (ITO) to which modes are conﬁned. At
αsds = 0.33, guided mode absorption is approximately
In contrast, scatter-
3/2 times larger than scattering.
ing is approximately 4 times larger than the absorption
for the radiation modes. Low absorption near the active
components of the device is clearly crucial for minimising
g and maximising the eﬃciency enhancement.

The principles of operation presented here suggest en-
hancements of up to a factor of 2 could be achieved
with a carefully designed device incorporating a scatter-
ing layer. Although this is comparable to microcavity
enhancements [6], here, the enhancement is achievable
across the visible spectrum. The design of an enhance-
ment layer for a broad spectral range would be limited by
the scattering strength drop-oﬀ at red wavelengths and
the diﬃculty associated with maximising coherent reﬂec-
tions. Despite this, calculation of the device structure
investigated here using scattering data from Mitsubishi
at green and red wavelengths show f (λ = 550) = 1.5 and
f (λ = 630) = 1.3. In addition, the device design could
be optimised for overall broad spectral performance.

their experiments with aerogel layers [9]. As the scat-
tering strength is increased, there is an initial reduction
in eﬃciency, mainly due second order scattering loss in
the low refractive index region. Above αsds = 0.05, how-
ever, f (αsds) > 1 and increases monotonically. For the
current design an enhancement that is 95 % of the lim-
iting value of ηs/ηc0 is attained. This is still almost a
two-fold enhancement in the eﬃciency. With the current
engineering capabilities of Mitsubishi Chemicals Corpo-
ration, nearly 75 % of the upper limit can be achieved,
corresponding to a 60 % enhancement.

The ﬁrst order scattering provides the largest contri-
bution to the enhancement factor. Indeed the ﬁrst order
scattering coeﬃcient in Eqn. (9) encapsulates the limita-

V. CONCLUSIONS.

A perturbative model was developed for the descrip-
tion of low refractive index scattering layers that enhance
the extraction eﬃciency of light from organic LEDs.
Components of the model were calculated using rigor-
ous electromagnetic techniques. The scattering model
was used to optimise an OLED design incorporating a
scattering layer. The calculations show that a two-fold
enhancement in the extraction eﬃciency is attainable.

Three parameters were highlighted as crucial to the en-
hancement mechanism. Most importantly a low refrac-
tive index medium that supports high refractive index

scattering particles is necessary to set the limiting en-
hancement factor and the scattering strength required to
attain it. Finally, the ratio of radiation to guided modes
must be minimised. Optimisation of the ﬁrst two param-
eters is diﬃcult as they depend on complex fabrication
techniques. In contrast, careful device design could al-
low the ratio of radiation guided mode scattering to be
reduced.

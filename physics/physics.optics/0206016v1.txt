Abstract

We investigate the propagation of electromagnetic waves in ﬁnite photonic

band gap structures. We analyze the phenomenon of conduction and forbid-

den bands and we show that two regimes are to be distinguished with respect

to the existence of a strong ﬁeld near the interfaces. We precise the domain

for which an eﬀective medium theory is sounded.

I. INTRODUCTION

The theoretical and numerical study of photonic band gap materials (see [1] for an
exhaustive bibliography) may be led both from the point of view of the spectrum, with the
computation of the band structure by using Bloch wave theory and the related quantities
(Density of States and so on), or from the point of view of the scattering theory [2]. In
case of a scattering experiment, which of course involves a ﬁnite structure, Bloch waves
are not a priori suﬃcient to describe the electromagnetic ﬁeld because of the existence of
evanescent and anti-evanescent waves, linked to the boundary of the device. Of course
these non-propagating modes are of prime importance in the band gaps, as they represent
entirely the total ﬁeld inside the photonic crystal, but they may also induce strong eﬀects
for frequencies lying inside the conduction bands.

In the context of electromagnetic optics and the spectacular eﬀects that can be obtained
using photonic crystals (the so-called ultra-refraction eﬀects [3–8]) a theoretical approach
only involving equivalent medium theories, group velocity [3–5] and more generally quantities
only derived from the band structure is certainly incomplete. Previous studies have shown
the importance of considering the isoenergy diagram and not only the dispersion diagram
[8,9]. In the present work, our aim is to analyse the relative importance of the evanescent

1

waves (the near-ﬁeld) for describing the electromagnetic ﬁeld inside a photonic crystal. More
precisely, we study the ratios of the projection of the ﬁeld on the propagating and non-
propagating modes, and we precise the conditions under which Bloch waves can describe
entirely the scattering behaviour of a photonic crystal.

II. PROPAGATING AND NON-PROPAGATING MODES

The photonic crystal under study is made of a stack of gratings. For the numerical
applications we use square dielectric rods in a dielectric matrix (ﬁg. 1). The basic layer of
the device is made of one grating, consisting of a slab of rods between two homogeneous
slabs above and below (ﬁg.1): it covers a band R× [−h/2, h/2]. The period of the grating
is d. We use time-harmonic ﬁelds with a time dependence of e−iωt and k = 2π
λ denotes
the wavenumber in vacuum. We have chosen this particular geometry (square rods and
rectangular symmetry) and polarization for the sake of simplicity (both on the numerical
level and for the theoretical exposition). However the theoretical framework is quite general
and works as well for more complicated situations (see [10] for an exposition of the transfer
matrix method for 3D obstacles).

Our aim is to characterize the ﬁeld inside the photonic crystal. Due to the transla-
tional invariance of the problem, we look for pseudo-periodic ﬁelds in the x direction:
u (x + d, y) = exp (iαd) u (x, y), where α belongs to the interval Y = [−π/d, π/d[.
In a
diﬀraction problem, where the grating is illuminated by a plane wave under the incidence θ
(ﬁg. 1), we have α ≡ k sin θ mod (π/d). From grating theory [11], we can deﬁne the trans-
T(α,λ) linking (u(x, h/2), ∂yu (x, h/2)) to
fer matrix of the basic layer, which is the operator
(u (x, −h/2) , ∂yu (x, −h/2)) (in ordinary diﬀerential equations theory this is the monodromy
matrix). There are many very good numerical methods for computing the ﬁeld diﬀracted
by a grating and hence the transfer matrix, even for stacks of gratings [12–14].

can distinguish between eigenvalues of modulus 1 that are necessarily ﬁnitely many, and
eigenvalues that do not belong to the unit circle of the complex plane. Let us denote
h , π
eiβh, β ∈

then we have T

(cid:3)
that (x, y) → eiαxψ (x, y) is a Bloch wave associated to the Bloch vector (α, β). That way
(cid:16)
we can easily compute the dispersion curves at a given wavenumber k. Moreover, we can
also compute the non-propagating modes inside the crystal: they correspond to eigenvectors
associated with eigenvalues that are not of modulus one. We have thus obtained a decompo-
sition of the modes by means of a family of monodromy operators parametrized by α ∈ Y .
As it as been said before, from the scattering point of view, the parameter α is equal to
k sin θ so that we study the spectrum of T(θ,λ) = T(k sin θ,λ).

We can now give the following deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 1 We call relative gap an interval of wavelengths Iθ, at a given incidence θ,
for which T(θ,λ) has no eigenvalues of modulus one and we call relative conduction band
an interval Bθ of wavelengths where T(θ,λ) does have eigenvalues of modulus 1.

Deﬁnition 2 A total gap corresponds to the intersection of incident dependent gaps (and
may be void).

III. ANALYSIS OF THE SPECTRUM

As it has already been stated, at a given wavelength, Bloch waves are not suﬃcient to
compute the scattering properties of the crystal. In order to quantify the relative importance
of the evanescent waves, we need to be able to get a decomposition of the ﬁeld.

A. Decomposition of the ﬁeld

Once the electromagnetic ﬁeld is known on the upper face of the crystal (through the
A± , obtained from a rigorous numerical method), it is possible to expand it
coeﬃcients
on the various modes that exist in the grating layer. More precisely, except on a set of
wavelengths of zero Lebesgue measure, matrix T(α,λ) can be put in diagonal form:

c

T(α,λ)= Tp⊕Te⊕Ta

where Tp is a ﬁnite rank operator corresponding to propagative waves and Te,Ta correspond
to the evanescent and anti-evanescent modes.
With this decomposition, the vector ψ =

writes ψ = ψp ⊕ ψe ⊕ ψa. Whence we
deﬁne the branching ratios πp (resp. πe, πa) of the ﬁeld on the propagating (resp. evanescent,
(cid:16)
anti-evanescent) modes by:

ψ+,

N (ψ)

where N (ψ) = kψpk2 + kψek2 + kψak2.

The point of the above decomposition is to quantify the relative importance of the various
modes in the total ﬁeld existing in the crystal, in order to understand to what extend the
ﬁeld is not solely described by Bloch waves.

B. Cut wavelengths and classiﬁcation of the conduction bands

Let us now turn to some numerical computations. The relative permittivity of the rods
is ε2 = 9 and ε1 = εext = 1, the geometric parameters are h = 2.8, d = 2.8, h1 = 1.9, d1 = 1.
The structure is made of one basic layer and we choose θ = 30◦ and s-polarized waves. In
ﬁg.2 (a), we give the absolute values of the eigenvalues of Tθ (λ) versus the wavelength.
The conduction bands are the regions with a horizontal straight line (|µ| = 1). For each
wavelength λ there is a ﬁnite, possibly empty, set of eigenvalues of modulus one
n
and an inﬁnite set of eigenvalues that do not belong to U = {z ∈ C, |z| = 1} (in ﬁg. 2 (b) we
(cid:9)
have plotted the real part of the spectrum of T(θ,λ), where the ﬁnite number of propagating
modes may be observed). We have also plotted in ﬁg.2 (c) the dispersion diagram (β, λ/d).
The comparison with ﬁg. 2 (a) shows that the consideration of the complete spectrum of
T(θ,λ) , i.e. with the non-propagating modes, allows to understand that one should not
treat on a diﬀerent foot propagating and non-propagating modes because they are really the
same physical entities, behaving diﬀerently according to the wavelength. When θ varies in
]−π/2, π/2[, the local gaps vary as shown in ﬁg. 3.

eiβn(λ)

(cid:8)

This ﬁrst example is rather generic and shows that within a given conduction band, hence
locally, it is possible to deﬁne continuous sections λ → µn (λ) ∈ sp
representing the
evolution of the eigenvalues of the monodromy operator with respect to the wavelength. At
some values of the wavelength however, these sections may encounter a bifurcation, or cut-
oﬀ: the eigenvalue leaves U and the associated modes give rise to an evanescent mode and an
anti-evanescent mode. At such a branch point, the section λ → µn (λ) is not diﬀerentiable
and may cross other sections. As a consequence, a global description of the sections is not
possible in that case. This problem is quite a complicated one, for which there is a general
theory [20,21], but even deriving a speciﬁc theory for our particular situation is quite a big
task and beyond the scope of this work.

T(θ,λ)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

However, an easy simpliﬁcation can be obtained by noting that the set of eigenvalues
being invariant under τ → τ −1, it is natural to consider the quotient space sp
/ ∼
for the equivalence relation µ1 ∼ µ2 if µ1µ2 = 1, which amounts to identify two eigenvalues
that are inverse one of the other. This operation gives a nice simpliﬁcation but still does
not allow to deﬁne global sections (a more detailed account of this situation will be given
elsewhere [15]).

T(θ,λ)

Remark 3 A very simple example of branch point is the extinction of a diﬀracted order in
grating theory. Another elementary situation is that of a stratiﬁed medium (a Bragg mirror
for instance) in which case there are only two propagative modes in the conduction bands and
one evanescent and one anti-evanescent mode inside the gaps. A realization of the quotient
space is obtained by considering
. In that case, this very set deﬁnes a
global section and the quotient space sp

For a given incidence, a gap is then an interval of wavelengths over which all the prop-
agative eigenvalues have encountered a bifurcation. In ﬁg. 2 (a), we have this situation in
the interval (1.32, 1.42).

When the wavelength tends to inﬁnity, it is known that the device ﬁnally behaves as a
homogeneous slab [16–19], and then there are only two propagative modes (up and down),
which means that all ”sections” ﬁnally bifurcate deﬁnitely (see ﬁg. 2 (a-b) for λ/d > 2.22),
except the one corresponding to the homogenization regime.
In that case there are still
evanescent (and anti-evanescent waves) but with a very huge damping exponent so that πe
and πa are small.

However, before that regime, eigenvalues may experience a local bifurcation: that is they
leave U over a ﬁnite interval but ﬁnally come back on it (in ﬁg. 2 (b) this situation happens
over the interval (1.63, 1.87)). What is important to note is that such a local bifurcation may
aﬀect only one eigenvalue so that, whithin a conduction band there may be evanescent ﬁeld
coming from such a bifurcation, hence with a small damping exponent (this happens over
the interval (1.32, 1.42) in ﬁg. 2 (a-b)). This leads us to distinguish between both regimes
and give the following deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 4 A conduction band is said local if among the evanescent modes within this
band there is at least one mode corresponding to a local bifurcation. A conduction band is
global if it is not local.

Let us now give some numerical examples of the various regimes described above. We
give in ﬁg.4 the absolute values of the eigenvalues of matrix T(0,λ) (normal incidence) for a
one layer structure with εext = 2.26, ε1 = 1, ε2 = 4 h = 1, d = 1, d1 = 0.5 and the projection
ratii πp,e,a. The region (1.28, 1.37) corresponds to a local conduction band, i.e.
in which
there is a local bifurcation of an eigenvalue. We see that the part of the ﬁeld on the non-
propagating modes is not at all negligible so that the ﬁeld cannot be described solely by
Bloch modes. On the contrary, for the interval (1.72, 1.8) the conduction band corresponds
to a global bifurcation of two eigenvalues of modulus one and in that case the damping
exponents are exponentially growing, so that almost Bloch waves only contribute to the
description of the ﬁeld.

A natural question is to know to what extend these situations persist when the number of
layers is increased. We have computed the values of the branching ratios when the number
N of layers is N = 2, 4, 6. The results are given in ﬁgures 5 (a-b-c). It can be seen that the
branching ratios πe and πp exhibit an oscillatory behavior with respect to λ, which is probably
linked to the excitation of resonances, but that the fraction of electromagnetic energy that
is carried by the evanescent waves is not diminished. This means that a non negligible part
of the ﬁeld is localized near the interfaces, which can have substantial consequences on the
propagation of a beam inside the structure (this situation will be analyzed in a forthcoming
paper [17]) but also on the local density of states for photons.

As an application, suppose now that the wavelength belongs to a global conduction
band and is such that there is only one diﬀracted and one transmitted order; then from the
knowledge of the transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients, it is possible to compute the (2 ×2)
monodromy matrix of the device. In that case, we can obtain the superior envelope of the
transmitted energy by considering only the transfer matrix of one basic layer [22]. We have

5

shown in another article [23] that in a layer characterized by a 2 × 2 transfer matrix, the
reﬂected and transmitted coeﬃcients for N layers can be obtained in close form :

rN (λ, θ) = f

µ2N − f g−1 , tN (λ, θ) = µN (1 − f g−1)

µ2N − f g−1

where µ is an eigenvalue of Tp = (tij) associated with an eigenvector u = (u1, u2), an
eigenvector associated to µ−1 is denoted by v = (v1, v2) and, denoting q(x1, x2) = iβ0x2−x1
iβ0x2+x1 ,

g (k, θ) = q (w) , f (k, θ) = q (v) if |q (w)| < |q (v)|

where G = {(k, θ) , |tr(Tp)| > 2} and B = {(k, θ) , |tr(Tp)| < 2} .

The superior envelope R∞ of the reﬂected energy, and conversely the inferior envelope of
the transmitted energy T∞ are given by [22]:

(cid:1)

A direct application of these formulas show a very accurate result in ﬁg.6 (a-b) for a global
conduction band.

We can conclude by the following:

Proposition 5 Within a global conduction band, the ﬁeld inside the crystal can be repre-
sented by Bloch waves only.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have shown that it is important to distinguish between various kinds of conduction
bands: there may be non propagative modes that result from the local bifurcation of a
propagative mode or all the non propagative modes may be made out of global bifurcation
of propagative modes. In the ﬁrst case, an important part of the ﬁeld inside the structure is
made of non-propagative modes, but in the second case, the ﬁeld writes in terms of Bloch
waves only. Especially near a band edge, one should be very careful before deriving the
behavior of the ﬁeld solely by looking at the dispersion diagram:
it does not take into
account the evanescent waves. These results might be useful in studying beam propagation
and superprism eﬀects in photonic crystals [24] and also the phenomenon of spontaneous
emission in a ﬁnite dielectric structure, for in that case the density of modes for photons
derived without precaution from Bloch theory is certainly false because the atom modes can
couple to non-propagating radiation modes [25].

We derive a partial-wave (Mie) expansion of the axial
force exerted on a transparent sphere by a laser beam focused
through a high numerical aperture objective. The results hold
throughout the range of interest for practical applications.
The ray optics limit is shown to follow from the Mie expan-
sion by size averaging. Numerical plots show large deviations
from ray optics near the focal region and oscillatory behavior
(explained in terms of a simple interferometer picture) of the
force as a function of the size parameter. Available experi-
mental data favor the present model over previous ones.

Optical tweezers are single-beam laser traps for neu-
tral particles that have a wide range of applications
in physics and biology [1]. Dielectric microspheres are
trapped and employed as handles in most of the quan-
titative applications. The gradient trapping force is ap-
plied by bringing the laser beam to a diﬀraction limited
focal spot through a large numerical aperture microscope
objective.

Typical size parameters β = ka (a = microsphere ra-
dius, k = laser wavenumber) range in order of magnitude
from values < 1 to a few times 101. A theory of the trap-
ping force based on geometrical optics (GO) [2] should
not work in this range. Other proposals (cf. [1]), based
on Mie theory, have employed unrealistic near-paraxial
models for the transverse laser beam structure near the
focus, incompatible with its large angular aperture.

We take for the incident beam before the objective,
propagating along the positive z axis, the usual Gaussian
(TEM)00 transverse laser mode proﬁle, with beam waist
1. We employ the
w0 at the input aperture, where kw0 ≫
Richards and Wolf [3] representation for the correspond-
ing strongly focused beam beyond the objective, with a
large opening angle θ0 (no paraxial assumption), taking
due account of the Abbe sine condition. This should be
a more realistic representation.

The microsphere, with real refractive index n2 (we ne-
glect absorption), is immersed in a homogeneous medium
with refractive index n1. We consider here the simplest
situation, in which the sphere center is aligned with the
laser beam axis, so that we evaluate the axial trapping
force. With origin at the sphere center, we denote by
qˆz the focal point position. The fraction A of total

By axial symmetry, the trapping force in this situa-
tion is independent of input beam polarization: we take
circular polarization. The electric ﬁeld of the strongly
focused beam (we omit the time factor exp(
iωt)) has

For each plane wave exp(ik

r) in the superposi-
tion (2), the corresponding scattered ﬁeld is given by
the well-known Mie partial-wave series [4], in terms of
the Mie coeﬃcients al, bl, that are functions of the size
parameter β and the relative refractive index n = n2/n1.
By substitution into (2), we obtain the total scattered
ﬁeld Es(r).

The trapping force is found by replacing the total ﬁeld
E = E0 + Es (likewise for B) into the Maxwell stress
tensor and integrating over the surface of the sphere. The
resulting axial force F is proportional to the focused laser
beam power P,

F = (n1/c)P Q,

(3)

where Q is the (dimensionless) axial trapping eﬃ-
ciency [1].

We denote by Qe the contribution from terms in E0Es
and B0Bs (that also give rise to the extinction eﬃciency)
and by Qs the remaining terms, so that Q = Qe + Qs.

In (9), θ1 = arcsin(q sin θ/a), θ2 = arcsin(sin θ1/n) are
the angles of incidence and refraction (deﬁned so as to
be negative if q < 0) at the sphere surface associated with
a component in the direction θ of the focused beam (2).
The corresponding Fresnel reﬂectivity for polarization j
) is rj . Eq. (9) may also be derived in the frame-
(
k
work of GO. Thus, the expression within curly brackets
agrees with the GO result for the force exerted by each
component ray as ﬁrst obtained in [9]. The remaining

⊥

,

pre-factors in (9), not accounted for previously, represent
the intensity distribution of the focused beam as implied
by the sine condition and the transverse proﬁle of the
laser beam at the input aperture of the objective.

In Fig. 1, Q is plotted as a function of q/a, the center
oﬀset from the focus in units of the sphere radius [10].
The numerical values chosen correspond to the experi-
ment of Ref. [11]: n1 = 1.33, n2 = 1.57, A = 0.85, θ0 =
78o, which by (1) yield γ2 = 0.99. The dotted curve
represents the GO result (9). The other curves repre-
sent the exact Mie results (4) and (5) for two diﬀerent
β values, corresponding to microsphere radii employed
in [11]: 1.42µm (dashed) and 2.16µm (solid), respectively
β = 18.8 and β = 28.4. The qualitative behavior of the
GO curve has been explained [2] in terms of competition
between radiation pressure (scattering force) and gradi-
ent force. However, the GO result for the maximum back-
ward trapping eﬃciency Qm is smaller (by a factor of the
order of 2) [12] than the values obtained in Ref. [2]. This
is in line with the discrepancy between experimental and
theoretical values noted in Ref. [13].

The Mie theory provides values for Qm (0.088 for β =
18.8 and 0.086 for β = 28.4 [14]) below the GO result
Qm = 0.095. The position at which the backward force is
maximum lies beyond the corresponding GO value q/a =
1.01. The stiﬀness decreases as this point is approached
from the focus, contradicting the GO prediction and in
agreement with an experiment reported in Ref. [13].

GO is also a poor approximation near the geometrical
focus, as expected. In fact, Fig. 1 shows that the exact
values deviate substantially from GO near q = 0. The
stable equilibrium position shows large positive as well
as negative oﬀsets from GO (further discussed below),
and the linear Hooke’s law range around the equilibrium
position is narrower than predicted by GO. Because of
the axial focusing eﬀect [6], the (nonuniform) asymptotic
approximations to the Mie angular functions employed in
the derivation of (9) break down at q = 0, although (9)
is continuous at this point, yielding, with θ1 = θ2 = 0,

< Q >GO (q = 0) =

< cos θ >,

(10)

4r
1 + r

where r is the Fresnel reﬂectivity for normal incidence
and < cos θ > denotes an average over the intensity dis-
tribution of the focused beam (2). Since the incident
rays are either backscattered or undeviated in this ap-
proximation, (10) represents pure radiation pressure in
GO.

The region around q = 0 deserves special treatment,
in view of its relevance to the evaluation of trap axial
stiﬀness. For β
1, the above discussion and the lo-
calization principle imply that the main contributions to
β,
(4) and (5) should arise from partial waves with l
so that we apply Hankel’s asymptotic expansions to the
spherical Bessel functions in the Mie coeﬃcients. The
results are independent of l, and the summations over

where ∆ = 4n2ωa/c. This expression corresponds to the
radiation pressure eﬃciency (twice the reﬂectivity) of an
inﬁnite set of parallel-plate interferometers (width 2a, re-
fractive index n2, so that ∆ is the round-trip phase), each
one oriented at an angle θ with respect to the axis, tra-
versed at normal incidence by the corresponding beam
angular component. The GO result (10) follows from (11)
by taking an incoherent average. Since n
1 is small,
we have r
1, so that the interferometer reﬂectivity is
nearly sinusoidal.

In Fig. 2, for the same parameters as in Fig. 1, we
plot Q at q = 0 as a function of β. The Mie curve (full
line) displays the expected near-sinusoidal oscillation as
β increases, approaching the interferometer behavior (11)
(shown in dotted line). The GO value (10) (dashed line)
is approached in the average sense. The two points corre-
sponding to the β values employed in Fig. 1 are shown by
circles. Since the radiation pressure at β = 28.4 is above
the GO value, the Mie value for the equilibrium position
qeq is larger than the GO result, in agreement with Fig. 1
(the opposite applies at β = 18.8). The values for qeq are
found by numerically solving the equation Q(qeq) = 0.
In the limit β
1, they are vanishingly small at β val-
ues that are minima of Q(q = 0). For β >∼ 5, qeq/a as a
function of β oscillates in phase with the oscillations of
Q(q = 0), around the GO value (qeq/a)GO = 0.217, and
with amplitude of the order of 0.17.

Again for the parameters of Ref. [11] (power P = 3mW),
we plot in Fig. 3 the Mie values of κ (solid line) [15],
the GO result κGO = (18/β)(pN/µm) calculated from
Eq. (13) (dotted line) and the experimental data points
from Ref. [11], with the respective error bars. We also
show (dot-dashed line) the values predicted by the elec-
trostatic model recently suggested by Tlusty et al. [16].
As could be expected, their approach may be applied
only in the low-frequency (Rayleigh) limit, where it may
be replaced by the simpler electric dipole approximation
(neglecting the variation of the ﬁeld over the sphere vol-
ume) already discussed above in connection with (4). In

order to test the sensitivity of the results to the focused
beam parameters, we also plot the Mie values for κ cor-
responding to a larger waist: γ2 = 0.3 (dashed line).

For β >∼ 10, the Mie values for κ oscillate around
the GO curve with period ∆β = π/(2n), like the force
Q(q = 0) [cf. (11)] and the equilibrium position. This cor-
responds to a frequency interval ∆ν = c/(4n2a), which
is in the THz range for spheres with radii of a few mi-
crons. As shown in the inset in Fig. 3, where we plot
(< κ >
κGO)/κGO as function of β, the average of the
Mie values, < κ >, stands above the GO curve, but the
relative diﬀerence decreases to zero as β increases beyond
β
55. For large sphere diameters, κ may become very
small over short β intervals. This may be of interest for
applications to scanning force microscopy [11].

In conclusion, by deriving an analytic Mie expansion
for the axial trapping eﬃciency, based on a more real-
istic model of optical tweezers, we are able to cover the
range of interest for most applications. Furthermore, the
connection with the correct GO limit (taking into ac-
count the sine condition) has been derived from the Mie
expansion by size averaging. The behavior near the fo-
cus has been obtained and interpreted in terms of an in-
terferometer model, which also accounts for equilibrium
position and trap axial stiﬀness oscillations. These oscil-
lations should be accessible to experiments by scanning
the laser beam frequency. Most experimental data points
lie above the GO values, closer to the wave optics predic-
tions computed from the Mie expansion employing only
the experimentally given parameters.

[12] The gradient force is overestimated in [2] as a conse-
quence of neglecting the sine condition and the corre-
sponding factor cos θ in Eq. (9), which diminishes the
contribution of rays at large angles. By the same reason,
the stable equilibrium positions as predicted by (9) are
further from the focus than the values obtained in [2].

[14] This shows that, in contradiction with the near–paraxial
results obtained by Wright et. al. [Appl. Phys. Lett. 63,
715 (1993)], Qm is not a monotonically increasing func-
tion of the sphere radius.

[15] The Mie values for κ are obtained by deriving from (4)

replacing the results for qeq into (12).

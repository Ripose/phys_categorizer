Abstract

The experiments with weak collinear probe pulses for time reversal

noninvariance study in optics are proposed and discussed.

PACS number: 42.50.Hz

The equivalence of forward and reversed processes is a fundamental concept
in optics today. However, this is only the hypothesis which does not have any
experimental proofs. In the nearest future this concept should be rejected. From
one side, because of it gives very meager possibility to explain physical origin
of great number of phenomena in nonlinear optics. Frequently such phenomena
have good mathematical description on the base of Bloch equations. However,
these equations do not have clear physical sense. The concept of interference of
”wave packets” or coherent states of molecules is usually used for explanation
of the origin of nonlinear phenomena. However, the concept of coherent states
in itself does not have clear and reliable physical base [1,2]. The concept of
inequality of forward and reversed processes is the alternative analog of the
concept of coherent states. In contrast to latter concept, it has clear physical
sense and gives good base for explanation of the origin of number of phenomena
in nonlinear optics [3].

From other side, the equivalence concept should be rejected because of the
opposite concept even today has several direct experimental proofs [4]. However,
the concept of time noninvariance is so radical for optics, that it is not clear to-
day how many experimental proofs will need for its recognition. A femtosecond
lasers should play important role here.

The obtained experimental results show, that the diﬀerence in cross-sections
of forward and reversed processes can exceed many orders of magnitude [5, 6].
The cross-section of reversed transition, obviously, has very sharp dependence
from the orientation of molecules in space, from the phase of vibrational motion
of atoms and even from the phase of laser radiation in the space. The classical
pump-probe experiments with femtosecond laser pulses will give, probably, the
most exact information of such kind. In such experiments two demands must
be fulﬁlled:

1) - the pump and probe beams should be exactly collinear,
2) - the pump pulse should not saturate optical transition and the probe
pulse should be very weak avoiding changing the distribution of species on the

energy levels.
Only such arrangement allows to obtain correctly information about the cross-
section of reversed optical transitions. The principle set up of such experiments
is shown in Fig.1a, where a ﬂuorescence of excited species is used in a detection
scheme.

It is surprising, but among the huge number of pump-probe experiments
with femtosecond lasers such experimental arrangement is not used till now.
The weak probe pulse is usually used in the cross beams geometry. This case
suits for four photon mixing, but does not suit for the study of the reversed
transitions into the initial state.

The most closely related experiments were carried out in [7-10]. The authors
studied the ﬂuorescence of molecules or atoms (which characterizes the popula-
tion of excited states) after it interaction with the pair of collinear phase-locked
femtosecond laser pulses. However, the authors used equal intensity of pump
and probe pulses. Such experiments should be continued in low intensity regime
with weak collinear probe pulse. Close to ideal intensity regime was used in [11],
but the demand of colinearity was not fulﬁlled. In proper conditions some am-
pliﬁcation of probe laser radiation without inversion should be observed in some
degree similar to results of [5]. It allows to make the evaluation of diﬀerence in
cross-sections of forward and reversed transitions.

Here, the widely spread mistake exists that femtosecond laser radiation can
align molecules in the so-called ﬁeld free regime [12, 13]. This point of view
does not have reliable experimental proofs. Our explanation is that the ob-
served revivals are the manifestation of very sharp dependence of the reversed
Raman transition’s cross-section from orientation of molecule in the space [14].
The discussed low intensity collinear pump-probe experiments will make this
situation clear. The principle scheme for reversed Raman transitions study is
shown in Fig.1b. As a detection tool, the high harmonic generation (HHG) [15],
the Coulomb explosion imaging [16] or polarization [17] techniques may be used.
The pump femtosecond pulse produces forward Raman transitions between the
ground states of molecules. The strong reading pulse is ﬁxed in time and turned
on the strong delayed revival. The weak collinear probe laser pulse is used for
study the eﬃciency of reversed Raman transitions. Rather close experiments
were carried out recently in [17, 18]. However, again the intensity of probe
pulses was too strong.

As a detection scheme in such experiments a four photon mixing phenomenon
in the so-called boxcars arrangement may be used [19, 20]. In such way the
high quality experimental result with Raman transitions were obtained recently
in [21]. It demonstrates not the suppression of alignment, but the erasing of
stored information by eﬃcient reversed process under action of the probe pulse
(as a whole quite similar to those in [10]). The additional experiments with
low intensity collinear probe pulses will give some information about relative
cross-section of the reversed Raman transitions into the initial state.

In conclusion, we discussed the experiments with weak collinear probe fem-
tosecond laser pulses for time invariance violation study in optics. Such ex-
periments will allow us to understand and to give clear physical explanation

”coherent control” [22].

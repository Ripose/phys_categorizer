Abstract: We study the polarization of light emitted
by spatially correlated sources. We show that in general po-
larization acquires nontrivial dependence on frequency due to
spatial correlations. The frequency dependence is found to be
absent only for a special class of sources where the correlation
length scales as the wavelength of light. We further study the
cross correlations between two spatially distinct points that
are generated due to propagation. It is found that such cross
correlation leads to suﬃciently strong frequency dependence
of polarization which can easily be measured experimentally.

In a series of interesting papers Wolf [1–3] showed that
in general spectrum of electromagnetic radiation does not
remain invariant under propagation, even through vac-
uum. The eﬀect arises if the source has spatial correla-
tions. The phenomenon was later conﬁrmed experimen-
tally [4–6] and has been a subject of considerable interest
[7,8]. Further investigations of the source correlation ef-
fects have been done in the time domain theoretically
[9] and experimentally [10]. Several applications of the
eﬀect have also been proposed [11–15]. In a related de-
velopment it has been pointed out that spectral changes
also arise due to static scattering [16–19] and dynamic
scattering [21–25].

In a recent paper [26] it was shown that spatially cor-
related sources lead to further nontrivial eﬀects if the
radiation is polarized. This was shown for the case of
monochromatic emission. In the current paper we study
the frequency dependence of this eﬀect. We are inter-
ested in sources where the emission from diﬀerent points
in the source are correlated i.e.
the phase and ampli-
tude shows systematic dependence on the position at the
source. One physical example we have in mind is radia-
tion from a plasma in the presence of background mag-
netic ﬁeld. The motion of charged particles at diﬀerent
spatial locations is in general correlated and will lead to
spatially correlated radiation.

Consider a spatially extended source of polarized ra-
diation as shown in ﬁgure 1. The electric ﬁeld vector ~E
at a far away point Q, located at a distance R from the
source, is given by,

Ei( ~R, ω) =Z d3rei(~r, ω)

eikρ
ρ

(1)

where ρ is the distance of the observation point Q from
the point P on the source (see Fig. 1), Ei( ~R, ω) represent
the θ, φ components of the electric ﬁeld vector, measured
at the point Q in a spherical polar coordinate system
with O at its origin. The vector ei(~r, ω) speciﬁes the

amplitude and phase of the wave originating from any
point P (~r). We can compute the coherency matrix [27,8]
at the point Q,

Jij( ~R, ω) = < E ∗

where the angular brackets represent ensemble averages.
The cross correlation matrix Wij (~r, ~r′, ω) is deﬁned as

Wij (~r, ~r′, ω) =< e∗

i (~r, ω)ej(~r′, ω) > .

Since R >> r, we can replace ρ and ρ′ in the denominator
in Eq. 2 by R. The (ρ − ρ′) term in the exponent can be
replaced by ˆu· ~∆, where ~∆ = ~r−~r′ and ˆu is a unit normal
in the direction of the observation point Q i.e. ˆu = ~R/R.

FIG. 1. Schematic illustration of spatially extended source
of polarized radiation and the observation point Q located at
a distance R from the source. P represents any point on the
source located at position ~r with respect to the origin O of
the coordinate system and at a distance ρ from Q.

Wij (~r, ~r′, ω) measures the correlations between two
spatially distinct points. We are interested in studying
the polarization at a point Q in the far zone when the
cross correlation matrix has nontrivial dependence on ~r
and ~r′. We consider only those sources such that the
polarization of light emitted from a particular point P
located at ~r is independent of frequency. We therefore
write,

Wij (~r, ~r, ω) = S(ω)jij (~r)

where S(ω) is the spectrum of light emitted by any point
on the source, and jij in general depends on ~r i.e. the
polarization of light emitted by diﬀerent points on the

1

source is not assumed to be same. If the spatially distinct
points are independent then,

Jij( ~R, ω) =

N S(ω)

R2

+ iσ2kˆulZ d3ra

(4)

Wij(~r, ~r′, ω) = N δ3(~r − ~r′)S(ω)jij(~r)

where N is a normalization factor. In this case we ﬁnd
that the resultant matrix J is given by

Jij ( ~R, ω) =

N S(ω)

R2

Z d3rjij (~r) ,

i.e. an integral over the coherency matrix elements over
the entire source.
In this case we ﬁnd, as expected,
that the resulting polarization at Q is independent of
frequency.

In general we may express the matrix W (~r, ~r′, ω) as,

Wij (~r, ~r′, ω) = N S(ω)j1/2

ii (~r)µij (~r, ~r′, ω)j1/2

jj (~r′)

where µlm(~r, ~r, ω) = µlm(~r, ω) is the usual complex de-
gree of coherence [27]. Substituting this into Eq. 2 we
ﬁnd that, in general, the polarization observed at the
far away point Q does depend on frequency.
In order
to illustrate this with some simple examples we further
specialize to sources for which the ~ra = (~r − ~r′)/2 and ~∆
dependence factorizes, i.e.

µlm(~r, ~r′, ω) = µli(~ra, ω)ξim(~∆, ω) .

(3)

We will consider only those sources for which µlm(~ra, ω)
does not depend on ω which implies that polarization of
light emitted from any point on the source is independent
of frequency.

In order to get oriented lets consider a very simple

example,

ξlm(~∆, ω) = f (∆, ω)δlm ,

i.e. it is proportional to an identity matrix upto an overall
function of ∆. In this case we ﬁnd that as long as jij
depends on ~r we expect nontrivial polarization eﬀects
due to the cross correlation term. In particular this term
will lead to a nontrivial dependence of polarization on
frequency. The coherency matrix in the far zone can
now be written as,

Jij( ~R, ω) =

N S(ω)

R2

Z d3rad3∆gij(~ra, ∆)f (∆, ω)eikˆu· ~∆ ,

where

gij(~ra, ~∆) = J 1/2

ii

(~r)µij (~r)J 1/2

jj (~r′) .

We take f (∆, ω) to be gaussian i.e.

exp[−∆2/(2σ2)]/(√2πσ)3 where σ in the correlation

length and is in general a function of frequency. Assum-
ing that σ is small we get dominant contribution only
for small values of ∆. We therefore expand gij(~ra, ~∆) in
powers of ~∆. Keeping only ﬁrst derivative term, we ﬁnd

f (∆, ω) =

e−σ2k2/2"Z d3ragij(~ra, 0)
gij(~ra, ~∆)|∆=0#

∂∆l

∂

The second term inside the brackets gives the leading
order correction due to spatial correlations. If we take
gij(~ra, ~∆) to be real then the second term leads to cir-
cularly polarized component. In this situation the radia-
tion from each point is linearly polarized, however spatial
correlations produce a circular polarization. In general
we ﬁnd that the state of polarization depends on fre-
quency unless the source obeys a scaling law such that
σ ∝ 1/k and gij(~ra, ~∆) = ˜gij(~ra, ~∆k). For such sources
there does not exist any fundamental length scale and
the spatial correlation length is proportional to inverse
of the frequency. In general we ﬁnd that in this case the
frequency dependence can be scaled out of the integral in
Eq. 2 and the polarization is independent of frequency.
This is analogous to the scaling law found by Wolf for
sources which do not produce spectral shifts in the far
zone.

We next consider another special case in which the
cross correlation matrix is independent of ~ra and depends
only on the relative coordinate ~∆. In this case we also
expect nontrivial polarization eﬀects as long as ξ(~∆, ω)
in Eq. 3 is not proportional to an identity matrix. As
expected in this case also the polarization depends on
frequency unless the cross correlation matrix obeys the
scaling law such that

ξlm(~∆, ω) = ξlm(ω ~∆)

which allows us to scale ω out of the integral in Eq. 2 and
the resulting matrix is independent of ω. We therefore
ﬁnd that the polarization in the far zone is independent
of frequency only for sources which obey this scaling law,
even if the coherency matrix J evaluated for a particular
point P is independent of ~r.

Next we consider a speciﬁc example and calculate the
frequency dependence arising due to correlations. We
consider a planar circular source or radius a, which is
spatially uncorrelated. The source emits polarized radi-
ation such that its coherency matrix is given by,

J(ρ, φ) = A(cid:18)

sin2 φ

− sin φ cos φ

− sin φ cos φ

cos2 φ

(cid:19)

(5)

where A is a constant and ρ, φ are the polar coordinates
of any point ~r′ on the source. The source luminosity
is independent of position and the polarization vectors
point along ˆφ. We point out that the source has been
constructed such that at any point close to the axis of
symmetry of the source the integrated polarization is zero
i.e. the polarization vectors from diﬀerent points in the
source cancel one another.

As is well known, although the source is uncorrelated,
the cross correlation between any two points P1 and P2
need not be zero due to the Van Cittert-Zernike theorem
[8]. We consider the experimental arrangement shown
in Fig. 2, where the light after being reﬂected from P1
and P2 is observed at the point Q. We are interested in
the frequency dependence of the polarization observed at
Q. The cross correlation matrix between any two points
P1(~r1) and P2(~r2) in the far zone close to symmetry axis
of the source, is given by,

Wij (~r1, ~r2, ν) =(cid:18) k

2π(cid:19)2Z d2r′Jij (~r′)

e−ik(a/r)L cos(φ−ψ)

r2

(6)

where k = 2πν/c (ν = frequency, c = speed of light),
L cos ψ = x2 − x1, L sin ψ = y2 − y1, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
are the cartesian coordinates of the projections of ~r1 and
~r2 respectively on the plane of the source and r = r1 = r2
is the distance of the point O on the source from points P1
and P2 which have been assumed to be placed symmetri-
cally for simplicity. In obtaining Eq. 6 we have followed
the treatment given in Ref. [8] for the calculation of cross
correlation between two points P1 and P2 close to the
symmetry axis of a spatially uncorrelated source. Lack
of spatial correlation implies that the cross correlation
2−~r′
matrix at the source Wij (~r′
1).
We have further assumed that Jij(~r′
1, ν) is independent
of the frequency ν. Note that since we are interested in
the frequency dependence of polarization we are working
in frequency domain. The integral in Eq. 6 is over the
source and we are using polar coordinates x′ = ρ cos φ
and y ′ = ρ sin φ.

s3 = 0

where v = kLa/r. We therefore ﬁnd that the wave is
linearly polarized at the point of observation Q with the
degree of polarization given by,

P = 2| − vJ1(v) + 2 − 2J0(v)|

v2 + 2vJ1(v)

which has nontrivial dependence on frequency. The ori-
entation of linear polarization, given by

tan(2ψ) =

2(x2 − x1)(y2 − y1)
(x2 − x1)2 − (y2 − y1)2 ,

is independent of frequency. The calculated degree of po-
larization for this example is plotted in Fig. 3. We clearly
see that it is a very signiﬁcant eﬀect and can easily be
observed experimentally. The orientation of linearly po-
larized component depends on the positions of P1 and P2
and contains information about the polarization proﬁle
of the source.

FIG. 2. Schematic illustration of a 2-D spatially extended
source of polarized light. P1(~r1) and P2(~r2) are any points
close to the axis of the source. After reﬂection from points
P1 and P2, light reaches the observation point Q, where its
polarization is measured as a function of frequency. Due to
spatial correlation between P1 and P2, the polarization of light
at Q displays a nontrivial frequency dependence.

Following the treatment given in [8] we can calculate
the cross correlation matrix and hence the stokes param-
eters at the point of observation. For the source under

point Q due to the source model speciﬁed by Eq. 5 as a
function of v = kLa/r. Here k is the wavenumber of light, L
is the distance between points P1 and P2 (see Fig. 2), a is
the radius of the primary 2-D source and r is the distance of
the points P1 and P2, assumed to be located symmetrically,
from the center of the source. The 2-D source is spatially
uncorrelated with uniform intensity and polarization vectors
pointing along ˆφ at any point (ρ, φ) on the source.

The lack of frequency dependence of the linear po-
larization happens only in this very special example.
We next study a somewhat more complicated source for
which the coherency matrix at any point ~r′ = (ρ, φ) is
same as that given in Eq. 5, with φ replaced by φ + αρ,
where α is a parameter.
In this case we numerically
calculate the stokes parameter. The frequency depen-
dence of the degree of polarization and the orientation
of linear polarization is shown in Fig. 4 for some rep-
resentative choices of the parameter α. The plot uses
x2 − x1 = 1 and y2 − y1 = −0.2 in arbirary units. The
state of polarization only depends on the dimensionless
quantities v = kLa/r, (x2 − x1)/L, (y2 − y1)/L and αa
where L2 = (x2 − x1)2 + (y2 − y1)2. We ﬁnd that in this
case both the orientation angle of the linear polarization
and the degree of polarization show a dramatic variation
with frequency, which can easily be observed experimen-
tally. The stokes parameter s3 vanishes in this case also
showing that there is no circularly polarized component
at the point Q.

of the state of polarization. The frequency dependence is
absent only in some very special circumstances. We have
considered the cross correlation between two points lo-
cated at a large distance from a 2-D uncorrelated source.
This cross correlation is found to lead to a dramatic fre-
quency dependence of the state of polarization which can
easily be observed experimentally.

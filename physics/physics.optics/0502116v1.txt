We realize a 2D array of multicolored upconverted para-
metric ampliﬁers, which generate multiple ampliﬁed beams
that can be synthesized coherently. The multiple ampliﬁca-
tions are pumped by two spatially overlapped and tempo-
rally synchronized femtosecond beams in a quadratic nonlin-
ear medium. On the basis of multi-step four-wave mixing in-
duced by the input beams and reproducible multiple ﬁlaments
due to small ellipticity of one of input beams, a synchronously
seeded super-continuum beam is diﬀracted nonlinearly and
then ampliﬁed coherently at the diﬀracted directions, leading
to multicolored ampliﬁcations at diﬀerent central wavelengths
with 2D array of spatial patterns. Synthesis of the ampliﬁed
pulses with diﬀerent spatial spectra is veriﬁed by a spectral
interferometry technique. The generated 2D patterns can be
readily controlled by seeding weak second harmonic pulses.
Such a control is independent upon the relative phase of the
seeding pulses. This provides a way to control the coherent
pulse synthesis.

The spontaneous breakup of an intense wave packet
and its deterministic control have renovated the mod-
ern nonlinear optics. One of the most active area of re-
search in this ﬁeld is to realize wave-packet localization
in temporal and spatial domains, such as solitons [1], ﬁl-
aments [2], and so on. Long light ﬁlaments have been ob-
served during the propagation of high-power ultrashort
laser pulses in atmosphere [3–5]. Multiple quadratic soli-
tons can be generated in a quadratic nonlinear medium
by ampliﬁcation of asymmetries [6–9]. Stable multiple
ﬁlaments (MFs) have been observed in water [10] and
air [11] due to the small asymmetry of the input beams.
A recent experiment has demonstrated that reproducible
MFs could be involved in multi-step four-wave-mixing
(FWM) processes [12], resulting in the generation of sta-
ble 2D multicolored transverse arrays (MTA). As MFs
have been demonstrated sensitive to weak beam con-
trol, MF-involved nonlinear processes can be readily con-
trolled to switch strong beams with a weak beam for
novel ultrashort photonic switches [13].

In this letter, we demonstrated experimentally that re-
producible MFs could launch multicolored up-converted
parametric ampliﬁcation (MUPA) under the pump of
two spatially overlapped and temporally synchronized fs
beams in a thick β-barium borate (BBO) crystal, leading
to the generation of a 2D array of MUPAs, whose spec-
trum covered a quite broad band in the visible/infared
region. The ampliﬁed beams of diﬀerent spatial spec-

tra and central wavelengths could be synthesized due to
phase preservation of MUPAs. We also demonstrated
that the 2D MUPA patterns could be readily controlled
by seeding weak second harmonic (SH) pulses. Such a
control is independent upon the relative phase of the
seeding pulses, and can be used to control coherent pulse
synthesis of MUPAs.

The experimental realization was carried out with a
regeneratively ampliﬁed Ti:sapphire fs laser (Spectra-
Physics, Spitﬁre) to produce fundamental wave (FW)
pulses (50 fs, 800 nm), which were split into an on-axis
beam ~k1 and two slightly oﬀ-axis beams ~k2 and ~k3 with
an intensity ratio as I~k1 :I~k2 :I~k3 =18:17:1. The on-axis ~k1
beam was focused by a spherical concave high-reﬂection
mirror at a small fold angle, and the oﬀ-axis ~k2 beam
was down-collimated with a concave high-reﬂection mir-
ror and a lens. The ~k1 and ~k2 input beams were steered
to cross inside a 4-mm-thick BBO (type-I, 29.18o-z cut)
crystal at a variable angle (θp in y-z plane) with accurate
synchronization and spatial cross-overlapping, and the
BBO crystal was placed 20 mm before the focus point of
the ~k1 beam. The beam diameters of the pumping pulses
were about 1.3 mm at the input facet of the BBO crystal.
The ~k1 and ~k2 input beams were o-polarized (perpendic-
ular to ~k1 and ~k2), and the BBO crystal was arranged so
that the on-axis ~k1 beam fulﬁlled the type-I SH phase-
matching condition. The ~k3 beams were attenuated and
then focused into an additional 2mm-thick sapphire crys-
tal to produce super-continuum (SC) pulses, which were
collimated into the crystal as seeding signal pulses after
ﬁltering the residual pulses at 800 nm with a low-pass
ﬁlter. When only the ~k1 pulses were present, colored
conical emissions were observed as a result of modula-
tional instability [13], and reproducible MFs were gener-
ated due to the on-axis beam ellipticity [12,14]. When
the ~k1 pulses and SC pulses were present, seeded ampli-
ﬁcation of colored conical emissions were observed in the
up-converted spectral region [13]. As shown in Fig.1(b),
additional ﬁlaments can also be generated owing to FWM
among the seeded ampliﬁcations, SH pulses of the input,
and the reproducible MFs. When the ~k1 and ~k2 pulses are
present, multi-step FWM processes are induced by the
input beams and reproducible MFs, and a transit FWM
grating is established in the BBO crystal [12]. As a con-
sequence, stable 2D MPAs are generated [12], as shown in
Fig. 1(a) for a typical case of θp=2.78◦. Under such a cir-
cumstance, a synchronous SC seeded is diﬀracted nonlin-
early and then ampliﬁed coherently along the diﬀracted

1

directions, rather than a single ampliﬁcation along the
seeding direction. Since the pumping pulses are provided
directly by the fundamental-wave (FW) beams, the mul-
tiple ampliﬁcations occurr as frequency up-conversions.
As shown in Figs.1(c) and (d), a 2D array of MUPAs are
observed with distinct central wavelengths for the ampli-
ﬁed beams of diﬀerent spatial spectra. The whole array
of MUPAs covers a spectrum of a quite broad band in
the visible/infared region. As compared in Figs.1(c) and
(d), the 2D array of MUPAs exhibit diﬀerent patterns
and spectral features as the SC seeding angle is changed.
To verify that the 2D array of MUPAs were originated
from ampliﬁcations of diﬀracted SC signals from the tran-
sit FWM grating, we scanned the delay between the ~k2
and ~k1 pulses while ﬁxed the delay between the ~k3 and
~k1 pulses. Figure 2 presents the dependence of MUPAs
upon the ~k2 pulse delay. As the ~k2 pulses walk oﬀ, the
MUPA pattern number is reduced. A detailed depen-
dence of the MUPAs upon the pulse delays is shown in
Fig.3, where G(ng, mg) stands for 2D array of MUPAs
with diﬀerent conical and azimuth angles, and G(ng=0,
mg=0) corresponds to the SC seed. A small delay be-
tween the ~k2 and ~k1 pulses makes the MUPA intensities
to decrease dramatically. As the ~k3 pulses are delayed,
the MUPA intensities change insensitively owing to the
temporally broadened structure of the SC seed. Figures
3(c) and (d) plot the dependence of the MUPA intensity
upon the pump intensities of ~k1 and ~k2 pulses. The in-
tensity thresholds of ~k1 and ~k2 pulses to launch MUPAs
are about 100 µJ and 1.2µJ, respectively. As the on-axis
~k1 pulses are closely related with the generation of stable
MFs followed by MF-involved FWMs to launch transit
FWM gratings, a relatively high energy of the ~k1 pulse is
required to launch MUPAs. With the increase of the ~k2
pump intensity, the MUPA intensity increases rapidly,
which becomes saturated at a ~k2 pump intensity of ∼
100 µJ. The intensity saturation is in principle caused
by multi-step FMWs which exchange energies among dif-
ferent MUPA patterns. Figure 3(f) plots the dependence
of intensity of a MUPA pattern upon the chirp of the
pump pulse. It clearly indicates that the maximum up-
conversion is achieved when a negative chirp (∼ 6000 fs2)
is introduced for dispersion pre-compensation.

The MUPA spectra covered a quite broad band in the
visible/infared spectral region. By changing the SC seed
angle, diﬀerent MUPA patterns were generated. Figure
4 shows MUPAs under diﬀerent SC seeding angles. The
MUPA patterns G(ng, mg) along the same column (with
the same mg but diﬀerent ng) exhibit a wavelength diﬀer-
ence less than ∼ 10 nm, while the MUPA patterns G(ng,
mg) along the same row diﬀer a lot in central wavelengths
with overlapped spectra for the adjacent patterns. To
verify whether the MUPA patterns were phase coher-
ent for pulse synthesis, we selected two patterns, for in-
stance, G(ng=0, mg=0) and G(ng=0, mg=-1), and then

2

combined the selected patterns with comparable preset
delays and intensities. Phase diﬀerence between the se-
lected patterns were measured in the frequency domain
by using the spectral interferometry technique [15]. Fig-
ure 5 shows a clear spectral interference of the synthe-
sized pulses. With diﬀerent preset delays, the combined
pulses exhibit diﬀerent spectral interference fringes [16].
The observed spectral interference demonstrated phase-
preserved seeding at various diﬀracted directions, and
phase preservation of MUPAs as well.

The 2D array of MUPAs could be controlled readily by
seeding a weak on-axis SH pulse. An additional 1mm-
thick BBO crystal (type-I cut) was placed before the 4-
mm thick BBO crystal to generate a weak SH pulse of ~k1
pulse. By rotating the thin BBO crystal, the energy ratio
SH/FW could be varied. The MFs originated from the
small input asymmetry could be suppressed by a weak SH
seed [14], which led to suppression of FWMs and accord-
ingly MUPAs. Figure 6 presents MUPAs under diﬀerent
SH/FW ratios. When the ratio SH/FW is about 1.2%,
the 2D array of MUPAs are reduced to 1D, and only
G(ng=0, mg=0) survives when the ratio SH/FW is about
5.7%. Figures 7(a) and (b) plot the detailed dependence
of MUPAs upon the energy ratio SH/FW. The thresh-
olds of the ratio SH/FW to suppress the MUPA patterns
are about 1.2%. With increase of the ratio SH/FW, the
MUPA patterns G(ng 6=0, mg) is suppressed at ﬁrst, and
Interestingly,
then the on-line patterns G(ng=0, mg).
the control process is not dependent upon the relative
phase shift of the SH seed. This was veriﬁed by rotating
an inserted 1mm-thick CaF2 plate to vary phase of the
weak SH seed. As shown in Figs.7(c) and (d), the sup-
pression of MUPAs is not aﬀected as the relative phase
shift of the SH seed is varied from 0 to 2π. Since the 2D
array of MUPAs can be synthesized coherently, a phase-
insensitive control of MUPAs provides a way to monitor
the coherent pulse synthesis, which should be of funda-
mental signiﬁcance in coherent control applications.

In summary, we have demonstrated experimentally the
generation and weak beam control of 2D arrays of MU-
PAs in a quadratic nonlinear medium. Due to phase
preservation of MUPAs, the MUPA patterns could be
synthesized. Coherent pulse synthesis of the 2D array
of MUPAs can be controlled by a weak seed pulse that
exhibits independence of control phase. We believe the
results presented here will lead to various intriguing ap-
plications in ultrafast science and coherent control appli-
cations.

Abstract

We study propagation of two lowest order Gaussian laser beams with diﬀerent wavelengths in

weak atmospheric turbulence. Using the Rytov approximation and assuming a slow detector we

calculate the longitudinal and radial components of the scintillation index for a typical free space

laser communication setup. We ﬁnd the optimal conﬁguration of the two laser beams with respect

to the longitudinal scintillation index. We show that the value of the longitudinal scintillation for

the optimal two-beam conﬁguration is smaller by more than 50% compared with the value for a

single lowest order Gaussian beam with the same total power. Furthermore, the radial scintillation

for the optimal two-beam system is smaller by 35%-40% compared with the radial scintillation

in the single beam case. Further insight into the reduction of intensity ﬂuctuations is gained by

analyzing the self- and cross-intensity contributions to the scintillation index.

INTRODUCTION

Propagation of light through atmospheric turbulence is the subject of a rich and very

active ﬁeld of research owing to the many applications in free space laser communications,

remote sensing, imaging systems and targeting [1, 2, 3]. In these applications it is usually

desirable to ﬁnd ways to reduce the turbulence eﬀects on the propagating optical beam. In

recent years there has been a renewed interest in using partially coherent sources of light as

a method for reducing the turbulence eﬀects and improving the system performance. Many

works concentrated on the case where the optical source is spatially partially coherent.

First, the properties of the mutual coherence function of spatially partially coherent beams

propagating in atmospheric turbulence were analyzed [4, 5, 6]. Later on it was shown that

intensity ﬂuctuations of spatially partially coherent Gaussian beams can decrease as the

coherence of the sources decreases [7, 8]. Additional computational evidence for the smaller

sensitivity of spatially partially coherent beams to turbulence was obtained by considering

the distance dependence of the coherence radius of the beam [9, 10]. More recently is

was shown theoretically [11] and experimentally [12] that the eﬀective propagation distance

measuring beam spreading in a turbulent medium relative to free-space spreading is larger for

spatially partially coherent beams than for fully coherent ones. Other works demonstrated

the improved performance obtained by using spatially partially coherent beams in terms of

the normalized intensity distribution [13], the mean squared beam width [14, 15], power in

the bucket and Strehl ratio [15], the scintillation index [16], the bit error rate (BER)[16, 17,

18] and the average signal to noise ratio (SNR)[16].

Generation of spatially partially coherent beams in various setups, e.g., by focusing a laser

beam on a rotating random phase screen, is quite straightforward. However, it is not clear

to what extent such setups would ﬁt in actual applications where reliability and compact-

ness of the optical source play an important role. Furthermore, even though a theoretical

method for optimizing a spatially partially coherent source was outlined in Ref.

[19], the

problem of implementing the method for realistic systems remains far from being resolved.

Consequently, one has to look for other methods for generating the partial coherence, which

are potentially more reliable and easier to optimize and to control. One very promising pos-

sibility is to look for a temporally partially coherent input optical ﬁeld generated by using

multiple laser beams with diﬀerent wavelengths. Indeed, in a typical situation in which the

2

response time of the detector is large compared with the inverse of the frequency diﬀerence

between any pair of beams in the input ﬁeld, rapidly oscillating contributions to the total

intensity would average out. As a result, one can expect smaller values of high moments of

the intensity compared with corresponding values in the single wavelength case. This would

in turn result in smaller values for the scintillation index and BER and higher values for the

SNR.

We emphasize that generation of a temporally partially coherent source of light consisting

of multiple laser beams with diﬀerent wavelengths can be realized in a convenient and eﬃcient

manner by using an array of vertical external cavity surface lasers (VECSELs). These

devices have the advantage of generating high power, high brightness wavelength tunable

TEM00 beams (lowest order Gaussian beams)[20]. Individual VECSEL devices have been

demonstrated with powers of 50 Watts running multi-mode [21] and up to 10 Watts, single

TEM00 mode and spectrally narrow (<0.1nm line width) [22]. Moreover, the semiconductor

multiple quantum well active mirror of these devices should allow for multi-GHz modulation

rates for data transmission.

Propagation of temporally partially coherent light in atmospheric turbulence was ﬁrst

studied by Fante [23, 24]. Considering a single inﬁnite plane wave this author obtained

approximate analytic expressions for the scintillation index of the planar wave in the weak

[23] and strong [24] turbulence regimes. Later studies extended these results to the cases

of a spatially incoherent source [25] and a source that is partially coherent in both space

and time [26]. More recently, Kiasaleh studied the scintillation index for a multiwavelength

inﬁnite plane wave in weak atmospheric turbulence [27, 28]. This author showed that use of

a multiwavelength plane wave leads to an increase in the achievable SNR as well as in the

upper bound on the SNR imposed by increasing the aperture size. These previous studies

focused on inﬁnite planar waves or on spherical waves, whereas in reality, Gaussian laser

beams with ﬁnite initial spot size and possibly non-zero phase front radius of curvature

are employed. Since the dynamics of the optical ﬁeld strongly depends on the initial spot

size and phase front radius of curvature it is important to take these characteristics into

account when calculating turbulence eﬀects. Furthermore, the fact that the optical ﬁeld of

N Gaussian laser beams depends on 2N additional parameters allows for a greater ﬂexibility

in optimization and control of the input ﬁeld against turbulence eﬀects. Thus, the lower

values for high moments of the intensity combined with the greater ﬂexibility make the setup

3

based on multiple Gaussian beams with diﬀerent wavelengths very advantageous and call

for a detailed investigation of the optical ﬁeld dynamics in this setup.

In this paper we take this important task and study propagation of two lowest order

Gaussian laser beams with diﬀerent wavelengths in weak atmospheric turbulence. Using the

Rytov approximation and assuming a slow detector we calculate the longitudinal component

of the scintillation index for both the Kolmogorov spectrum and the Von K´arm´an spectrum.

For a typical setup of a free space laser communication system we show that the longitudinal

scintillation exhibits a minimum as a function of the initial beam separation. We interpret

this minimum as corresponding to the optimal conﬁguration of the two-beam system, where

optimization is with respect to the value of the longitudinal scintillation. Moreover, the

longitudinal scintillation for the optimal two-beam conﬁguration is smaller by more than

50% compared with the longitudinal scintillation for a single lowest order Gaussian beam

with the same total power. The existence of the longitudinal scintillation minimum is

found to be independent of the turbulence spectrum. Furthermore, we calculate the total

scintillation index for the optimal two-beam conﬁguration using the Von K´arm´an spectrum

and ﬁnd that the values of the total scintillation are smaller by 12%-64% compared with

the corresponding values for a single Gaussian beam with the same total power. Further

insight into this improvement is gained by decomposing the total scintillation into self- and

cross-intensity contributions. Finally, we show that the radial scintillation for the optimal

two-beam system is smaller by 35%-40% than the radial scintillation in the single beam case.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the method used to

calculate the scintillation index as well as general expressions for the scintillation index of

a system consisting of N Gaussian laser beams with diﬀerent wavelengths. In section 3 we

analyze in detail the total scintillation index as well as its longitudinal and radial components

for a two-beam system considering a typical setup of a free space laser communication

system. Section 4 is reserved for discussion.

In Appendix A we derive in detail some

relations appearing in Section 1.

CALCULATION OF THE SCINTILLATION INDEX

We consider propagation of N lowest order Gaussian laser beams with diﬀerent wave-

lengths λj, where j = 1, ..., N, in weak atmospheric turbulence. For simplicity and without

4

loss of generality we assume that the beams are linearly polarized and propagate along the

z axis. We denote by dj the locations of the beam centers at the input plane z = 0. Thus,

the magnitude of the total electric ﬁeld E at z = 0 is given by

E(r, 0, t) =

We assume that the intensity of the optical ﬁeld is small enough so that its evolution is

SPECIFIC SETUPS, OPTIMAL CONFIGURATION AND REDUCTION OF THE

TOTAL SCINTILLATION INDEX

We consider in detail a system with two lowest order Gaussian beams whose wavelengths

are λ1 = 1.0 × 10−6m and λ2 = 1.01 × 10−6m, and whose initial spot sizes are W01 = W02 =

1.0cm. The initial locations of the spot centers are d1 = −dˆy/2 and d2 = dˆy/2 so that

the initial beam separation is d. We assume that the initial on-axis amplitudes are equal

A01 = A02 and that the beams are initially collimated so that F01 = F02 = ∞. We use the

Von K´arm´an spectrum to describe the refractive index ﬂuctuations

where κin = 5.92/l0, κout = 1/L0, l0 and L0 are the turbulence inner and outer scales,

respectively, and C 2

n = 3.0 ×
10−15m−2/3, corresponding to weak atmospheric turbulence conditions, and l0 = 1.0mm,

n is the refractive index structure parameter. We choose C 2

L0=1.0m. We concentrate on the statistics at a propagation distance L = 1km, where the

Rytov variance

R = 1.23C 2
σ2

(26)

is about 0.1 for both beams and one can indeed employ the Rytov perturbation method.

The free space spot sizes of the beams at this distance are about 3.3cm each.

Using the above relations we ﬁrst calculate the longitudinal component of the scintillation

index as deﬁned by Eq. (14). The longitudinal component is of special importance when

the spot size is large compared with the radius of the receiver’s collecting lens since in this

case the average signal to noise ratio is predominantly determined by the on-axis values of

hIi and hI 2i. The dependence of σ2

I,l on the initial separation between the two beams d for
the aforementioned values of the parameters is plotted in Fig. 1 (solid line). It can be seen

that the curve σ2

I,l(d; L) possesses a minimum at an intermediate value of d, d0 = 2.8cm.
Clearly this minimum corresponds to the optimal conﬁguration of the two-beam system for

the given physical parameters, where optimization is performed with respect to longitudinal

scintillation. The ﬁgure also shows a comparison with the longitudinal scintillation of a single

lowest order Gaussian beam with the same total power P0 = πA2

0W 2

0 for the following two

cases: (a) the single beam has the same initial spot size as that of each of the two beams

(square); (b) the single beam has the same amplitude as that of each of the two beams

(circle). One can see that the two-beam system gives a 53.4% reduction of the longitudinal

scintillation in comparison with the single beam value in case (a) and a 56.9% reduction in

comparison with the single beam result in case (b). The dashed line in Fig. 1 corresponds

to the result obtained by using the Kolmogorov spectrum

Φn(κ) = 0.033C 2

nκ−11/3.

(27)

The dotted line corresponds to the approximate result obtained by using the Kolmogorov

spectrum (27), assuming that for each beam rj < Wj, and expanding up to the second order

with respect to rj/Wj. The comparison of these two results with the result based on the

Von K´arm´an spectrum shows that for the parameters considered here the existence of the

minimum of σ2

I,l(d; L) is not very sensitive to the details of the spectrum model. In addition,
the minimum value of the longitudinal scintillation and the location of the minimum d0

obtained by using the more realistic Von K´arm´an spectrum are slightly smaller than the

values obtained by using the Kolmogorov spectrum.

In order to better understand the origin of the minimum of the longitudinal component

of the scintillation index we further decompose σ2

I,l into a self-intensity contribution σ2

I,l,s

a direct consequence of this opposite behavior of the self- and cross-intensity contributions

with increasing beam separation.

When the spot size is comparable with the radius of the receiver’s collecting lens the radial

component of the scintillation index becomes important and one should take into account

both longitudinal and radial contributions.

In Figure 3 we present the total scintillation

index of the two-beam system for the optimal conﬁguration, i.e.

for d = d0 = 2.8cm, in

a 8cm×8cm domain centered about the z axis. The total scintillation index attains values

in the range 0.011 < σ2

I < 0.474. The minimum value of the scintillation is attained
on the z axis since the two beams are already strongly overlapping at this distance, i.e.,

d0/2 < W1, W2.

It is very instructive to analyze the reduction in the total scintillation index obtained

by using the optimal two-beam system relative to a single lowest order Gaussian beam for

cases (a) and (b) mentioned above. For this purpose we denote by σ2

I,b the total
scintillation of a single beam in cases (a) and (b), respectively, and deﬁne the fractional

I,a and σ2

reduction in the total scintillation relative to the single beam values in the two cases as

Figure 4 shows Ra(r, L) in the 8cm×8cm domain. It can be seen that in case (a) the fractional

reduction factor is in the range 0.124 < Ra < 0.639 which means that the reduction is larger

than 12.4% everywhere within the 8cm×8cm domain and can be as large as 63.9%. Similar

calculation shows that the relative reduction in the total scintillation in case (b) is even

larger.

In both cases, the largest improvement is obtained along the y axis and in the

corners of the domain. The smallest improvement is along the x axis, where the total

intensity is initially small. This behavior suggests that in a 4-beam system further increase

of the value of R can be obtained by locating the two additional beams along the x axis.

To get further insight into the results presented in Figs. 3 and 4 we decompose the total

scintillation index into self- and cross-intensity contributions σ2

I,s and σ2

I,c in the following

manner

The self- and cross-intensity contributions to the total scintillation index for the optimal

two-beam system are shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. The self-intensity contribution

attains values in the range 0.523 < σ2

I,s < 1.354 whereas the values of the cross-intensity

contribution are in the range 0.052 < σ2

in the corners of the 8cm×8cm domain, where the σ2

I,s are attained
I,c contribution is negligible. It is also
I,s are larger along the y axis and smaller along the x axis. This
behavior is due to the contributions coming from the radial scintillation of each beam. The

I,c < 0.582. The largest values of σ2

seen that the values of σ2

largest σ2

I,c values are attained on the x axis. These values are comparable to the values of
σ2
I,s on the x axis which explains the relatively small values of Ra seen along the x axis in
Fig. 4.

In analyzing the behavior of the radial scintillation we ﬁrst note that unlike the situation

in the single-beam case, in the two-beam case σ2

r (r, L) is not radially symmetric. To enable
comparison with the single-beam result we deﬁne the circularly averaged radial scintilla-

tion in the two-beam case σ2

rr as the average over angle θ of the radial scintillation index:

11

rr(r, L) ≡ hσ2
σ2
rr for the optimal two-beam system is shown
in Fig. 7. The ﬁgure also shows a comparison with the radial scintillation of a single lowest

r (r, L)iθ. The r-dependence of σ2

order Gaussian beam with the same total power and initial spot size. It can be seen that

the value of the radial scintillation index for the optimal two-beam system at a given r is

smaller by about 35%-40% than the corresponding value for the single beam. Therefore,

optimizing the two-beam system with respect to the longitudinal scintillation also leads to

a signiﬁcant reduction in the radial scintillation.

CONCLUSIONS

We investigated the dynamics of two lowest order Gaussian laser beams with diﬀerent

wavelengths in weak atmospheric turbulence. Assuming a Von K´arm´an turbulence spectrum

and slow detector response and using the Rytov approximation we calculated the longitudinal

and radial components of the scintillation index for a typical free space laser communication

setup. We found that the longitudinal scintillation possesses a minimum as a function of the

initial beam separation. This minimum corresponds to the ideal conﬁguration of the two

beams, where optimization is performed with respect to the longitudinal scintillation index.

The longitudinal scintillation for the optimal two-beam conﬁguration is smaller by more

than 50% compared with the value for a single lowest order Gaussian beam with the same

total power. We introduced the self- and cross-intensity contributions to the longitudinal

scintillation index and explained the existence of the minimum in terms of the opposite

behavior of these contributions with increasing beam separation. Similar calculations of

the longitudinal scintillation with the Kolmogorov spectrum show that the existence of the

minimum is not very sensitive to the form of the turbulence spectrum.

In actual applications the radial component of the scintillation index might be as impor-

tant as the longitudinal component. We therefore calculated the total scintillation index

for the optimal two-beam conﬁguration. We found that for the same typical setup con-

sidered above the values of the total scintillation are smaller by 12%-64% compared with

the values of the total scintillation for a single beam with the same total power. Further

analysis showed that the reduction of the scintillation obtained by using the optimal two-

beam conﬁguration was largest along the y axis, where the centers of the two beams are

initially located, and smallest along the x axis, where the total intensity is initially small.

12

This behavior is attributed to the relatively large values of the cross-intensity contributions

to the total scintillation along the x axis. It also suggests that in a four-beam conﬁguration

the system’s performance can be further improved by locating the two additional beams

along the x-axis. Finally, we showed that the circularly averaged radial scintillation index

for the optimal two-beam conﬁguration is smaller by 35%-40% compared with the radial

scintillation for a single beam with the same total power.

The results presented in this paper open many promising pathways for future theoretical

research. A natural extension of this study is to investigate a system with N > 2 Gaussian

beams and to characterize the N-dependence of the scintillation reduction relative to the

single beam case. Another possible direction is to study the dependence of the scintillation

index in the multi-beam multi-wavelength case on the convergence/divergence of the beams,

i.e., on the values of the phase front radii of curvature. Optimization with respect to the

radial scintillation index at a given radius is yet another interesting problem. From the

applications point of view it would be very interesting to evaluate the average signal to

noise ratio and bit error rate of the multi-beam multi-wavelength system. This will require

calculation of the optical ﬁeld after the receiver’s collecting lens as well as calculation of

aperture averaging eﬀects. Such calculations can be carried out in a straightforward manner

by employing the ABCD ray matrix theory [3, 29].

DERIVATION OF EQS. (21)-(24)

In this appendix we derive Eqs. (21)-(24) for the cross-intensity term hIj(rj, L)Im(rm, L)i.

The derivation is based on the second order Rytov approximation and follows the outline

of the calculation of hI 2(r, L)i for a single lowest order Gaussian laser beam presented in

chapters 5 and 6 of Ref. [3]. Within the framework of the Rytov approximation the optical

13

ﬁeld of the j-th beam is given by Eq. (6). Therefore, the intensity of the j-th beam is

Ij(rj, L) = I0j(rj, L) exp

ψj(rj, L; kj) + ψ∗

j (rj, L; kj)

,

(36)

where I0j(rj, L) is given by Eq. (17). It follows that

Noting that

(see also Ref. [3] p. 130) we arrive at

hIj(rj, L)i = I0j(rj, L) exp [2E1j(rj; kj) + E2jj(rj, rj; kj, kj)] ,

2Re [E3jm(rj, rm; kj, km)]} ,

(49)

which is Eq. (21).

Next we derive Eq. (22) for E2jm(rj, rm; kj, km). Within the framework of the Rytov

perturbation method the ﬁrst order term ψj1(rj, L; kj) is given by (see Ref. [3] p. 105)

(50) into Eq. (44) and using the correlation relation

hν(K, z)ν∗(K′, z′)i = Fn(K, |z − z′|)δ(K − K′)d2Kd2K′

(54)

where δ(K) stands for the Dirac delta function and Fn(K, |z − z′|) is the two-dimensional

spectral density of the refractive index ﬂuctuations we obtain

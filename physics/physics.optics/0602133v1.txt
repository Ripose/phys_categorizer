(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We investigate the optical response of two sub-wavelength grooves on a metallic screen, separated
by a sub-wavelength distance. We show that the Fabry-Perot-like mode, already observed in one-
dimensional periodic gratings and known for a single slit, splits into two resonances in our system : a
symmetrical mode with a small Q-factor, and an antisymmetric one which leads to a much stronger
light enhancement. This behavior results from the near-ﬁeld coupling of the grooves. Moreover, the
use of a second incident wave allows to control the localization of the photons in the groove of our
choice, depending on the phase diﬀerence between the two incident waves. The system exactly acts
as a sub-wavelength optical switch operated from far-ﬁeld.

Surface Enhancement Raman Scattering (SERS) still
remains a mystery in a large part, even though it is now
accepted that the excitation of localized electromagnetic
modes of irregular metallic surfaces is involved in its ba-
sic mechanism[1, 2]. Optical excitation of such modes
can indeed lead to important concentration of electro-
magnetic energy in volumes (cavities) much smaller than
λ3 where λ is the excitation wavelength, as it is the case
for SERS active surfaces. These speciﬁc places of very
strong electromagnetic ﬁelds localization are called ”ac-
tive sites” or ”hot spots”. However, the debate on the
origin of these hot spots remains open, as well as the
hope to control one day this phenomenon. The large in-
terest raised by this fundamental physics is also increased
by its wide potential applications in biochips, sensors,
nano-antennae, optoelectronics or energy transport on
nanostructured surfaces.

In this letter, we consider a simple system which al-
lows to produce and control the localization in space of
such hot spot phenomenon. It only consists of two deep
grooves on a plane metallic gold surface (ﬁg.1). The ex-
cited modes appear, for the chosen geometry, in the in-
frared region where we can consider the metal as be-
ing a good reﬂector. Under this condition, a reliable
theoretical method, i.e the modal method using surface
impedance boundary conditions, can be used [3]. This
method has already demonstrated its ability to give a
good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the
measured reﬂectivity of metallic gratings [4, 5, 6]. The
case of one groove only was considered a long time ago
[7], while the transmission for one [8] and two slits [9]
were only recently considered. In contrast with [9], the
distance between our two grooves is small with respect to
the incident wavelength. Very recently it also was shown
[10] that sharp and deep resonances appear in the trans-
mission response of gratings with more than one slit per
period or in gold dipole antennas[11]. We here analyze
the physical origin of this new kind of resonances for a

two slit system. As we will see, this allows us to point
out some very fundamental aspects of electromagnetic
resonances on metallic surfaces, and to control the light
localization by using a simple device.

We consider a p-polarized incident plane wave (elec-
tric ﬁeld in the plane of incidence) with a wavevector
k = 2π/λ impinging on the surface at an angle θ (ﬁg.1).
The knowledge of the magnetic ﬁeld in the z-direction
completely solves the problem as Hx = Hy = Ez = 0,
i/ckε0)∂Hz/∂x. In
Ex = (i/ckε0)∂Hz/∂y and Ey = (

assumes
that the ﬁeld is constant along x within each groove,
which is a good approximation in the limit where w << λ
[4, 5]. To illustrate our results numerically, we have ﬁxed
w = 0.2 µm, h = 1.5 µm, and d = 0.5 µm all along the
paper. The values of the complex dielectric constant ǫ(λ)
are taken from [12].
The unknown variables are the distribution R(Q) and
the ﬁeld amplitudes A1 and A2 in the ﬁrst and sec-
ond groove respectively. A set of equations is obtained
by applying the boundary conditions at the interface

At the sight of eq.(1), one can see that the system
presents two electromagnetic resonances at k = k±,
(e−) = 0, with line-
(e+) = 0 and
which appear when
shapes respectively governed by
(x)
and
(x) being the real and imaginary parts of x). The
ﬁelds in the cavities are always a linear combination of
a−U− + a+U+. However,
the two eigenvectors A
when k = k+ (respectively k = k−), the vector A is al-
most collinear with U+ (resp. U−) as the amplitudes in
the two cavities are dominated by the same (resp. the
opposite) term. We will thus call the resonance occur-
ring at k = k− the (
) antisymmetric mode and that
occurring at k = k+ the (+) symmetrical one. Contrary
to the (+) mode which always exists, the (
) one only
develops for θ
= 0 (see ﬁg.2) as it vanishes at normal
incidence with tanϕ = 0. Its bandwidth is much thinner
than that of the symmetrical mode and its enhancement
factor is much larger. The enhancement factor (EF ), de-
2 where E0 is the incident electric ﬁeld,
ﬁned as
reﬂects the amount of stocked electromagnetic energy at
the resonances. For convenience, we note EF1 and EF2
the enhancement factors calculated at the mouth of each
d/2 and y = 0 where they are ex-
cavity, i.e at x =

(
) mode, shown in the inset (a) of ﬁg.2, increases with
−
θ and its value can reach more than 103 whereas that of
the symmetrical mode stays at around 100.
Another important point to highlight is that around the
(
) resonance, the ﬁelds in the two cavities are not
−
strictly identical. Inset (b) of ﬁg.2 displays the EF at
the mouth of each cavity close to k = k−. At 1483 cm−1
the maximum of EF1 is reached whereas the value of
EF2 is still low; at 1490 cm−1 EF1 and EF2 both take
the same value. Around this mode, the system thus de-
velops a very high sensitivity: with a very little variation
of wavenumber (here less than one percent), the ﬁeld
”jumps” from one cavity to the other. This behavior is
qualitatively comparable to the ”unstable” behavior of
hot spots observed on SERS active surfaces.

In the following, we consider the metal as being a per-
fect reﬂector, i.e Z = 0. This approximation induces only
small quantitative modiﬁcations and allows an analytical
study which highly helps to clarify the physics of the
problem. however, the presented numerical results are
obtained without this approximation, i.e using the ﬁnite
value of ǫ(λ). We ﬁrst compare the two grooves system to
the one where there is only one groove centered at x = 0.
In this case, the amplitude of the ﬁeld A0 in the unique
cavity is given by A0 = i

that our results are completely similar to those obtained
by Lyuboshitz[13] for two near-ﬁeld coupled oscillating
dipoles. Our resonances thus arise from the near-ﬁeld
coupling of two identical grooves, individually resonat-
ing at ω0. The symmetrical (+) mode corresponds to
the in-phase oscillation of each cavity whereas the sec-
ond one corresponds to an anti-phase oscillation. The
distribution of electric ﬁeld in the cavities for each mode
is sketched in ﬁg.3. As a consequence of this coupling,
the (+) mode has a strong dipolar character with an ef-
fective dipolar moment close to twice that of a unique
cavity and a large electromagnetic radius r+ = 2r0. On

the opposite, the (

ment almost null, with a much smaller electromagnetic
radius r− = r0(k0d/2)2, and its radiation pattern is es-
sentially that of a quadripole. This explains why this
mode is weakly radiative and with an extremely narrow
lineshape, very diﬀerent from the width of the in-phase
mode.

We now take advantage of our understanding to control
- from far ﬁeld - the light localization in the cavity of our
choice, or in both. To do so, we introduce a new free pa-
rameter by sending a second incident plane wave, at the
same frequency, with an incidence angle

phase diﬀerence φ with respect to the ﬁrst incident wave
(ﬁg.1). Changing φ, we can control the incident eﬀective

As φ is a parameter easy to modify, for instance chang-

the ﬁeld can be strongly localized in only one of the cav-
ity, while the second one is completely extinguished and
this, even though the cavities are identical and separated
by a sub-wavelength distance.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the near-ﬁeld
coupling of two metallic resonating cavities leads to a res-
onance with an extremely thin spectral width, which can
localize very intense ﬁelds. This could be a key point in
the understanding of the SERS, as the described physics
should remain valid in the visible region, except for a
scaling factor. Finally, we proposed a simple way to con-
trol the near-ﬁeld of each cavity, enabling this system to
act as a sub-wavelength optical switch simply operated
from the far-ﬁeld.

This work is partly the result of illuminating discus-
sions of P. Qu´emerais with D. Mayou which have been
very beneﬁcial to us. We also would like to thank P.

Lalanne for helpful conversations about electromagnetic
resonances in gratings.

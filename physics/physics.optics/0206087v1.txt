Etched distributed Bragg reﬂectors as three-dimensional photonic crystals: photonic

The photonic band dispersion and density of states (DOS) are calculated for the three-dimensional
(3D) hexagonal structure corresponding to a distributed Bragg reﬂector patterned with a 2D tri-
angular lattice of circular holes. Results for the Si/SiO2 and GaAs/AlGaAs systems determine the
optimal parameters for which a gap in the 2D plane occurs and overlaps the 1D gap of the multilayer.
The DOS is considerably reduced in correspondence with the overlap of 2D and 1D gaps. Also, the
local density of states (i.e., the DOS weighted with the squared electric ﬁeld at a given point) has
strong variations depending on the position. Both results imply substantial changes of spontaneous
emission rates and patterns for a local emitter embedded in the structure and make this system
attractive for the fabrication of a 3D photonic crystal with controlled radiative properties.

I. INTRODUCTION

Photonic crystals are being intensively studied with
the goal of achieving a photonic band gap as well as con-
trol of light propagation and light-matter interaction at
visible frequencies [1–4]. A complete photonic gap in
three dimensions (3D) has been demonstrated for the di-
amond lattice of dielectric spheres [5], the fcc lattice of
air spheres (or “inverse opal”) [6,7], the “yablonovite”
[8], the “woodpile” [9], and other more complex 3D ge-
ometries [10,11]. All these structures are diﬃcult to fab-
ricate at optical wavelengths: they often require the use
of a bottom-up procedure, like e.g.
in the case of in-
verse opals, where the template is ﬁrst built by self-
assembling of dielectric spheres in a solution and the
voids are subsequently ﬁlled with a high refractive in-
dex material [12–14]. As an alternative, two-dimensional
(2D) photonic crystals can be fabricated with a top-down
approach based on lithography and etching. This pro-
cedure can be realized at sub-micrometric wavelength
scales and allows for the controlled introduction of lin-
ear and point defects. A main problem however concerns
the control of light propagation in the third (vertical)
dimension: even in the case of a waveguide-embedded
2D photonic crystal, radiation losses due to out-of-plane
diﬀraction in the vertical direction cannot be eliminated
for photonic modes which lie above the light line [15–17].
In this work we explore theoretically another possi-
bility for achieving control of light propagation in 3D,
namely the use of distributed Bragg reﬂectors (DBRs)
patterned with a 2D lattice in the layer planes. DBRs
are dielectric multilayers which are periodic in one di-
mension (1D) [18–20], i.e., they represent 1D photonic
crystals and have a band gap for propagation of light
along the multilayer axis. By patterning and etching a

DBR with a 2D lattice which possesses a photonic gap, a
3D photonic crystal with uniaxial (or biaxial) symmetry
is obtained: if the 1D gap of the multilayer is made to co-
incide with the gap of the 2D structure, a common band
gap for light propagating along the main crystal axes can
be achieved. Although a complete photonic band gap in
3D is not expected (due to the angular dependence of the
1D and 2D gaps, or else to the anisotropy of the Brillouin
zone), an appreciable control of the photonic density of
states (DOS) and consequently of the spontaneous emis-
sion properties may be realized. In such a situation, the
etched DBR represents a favorable system for the study
of spontaneous emission control in 3D photonic systems,
since local (and possibly active) defects can be introduced
at the level of 1D epitaxial growth and of 2D lithographic
design.

Here we focus on the simplest and most promising
structure, namely a DBR patterned with a triangular
lattice of holes: the planar structure is known to dis-
play a 2D photonic gap common to both polarizations
of light, if the dielectric constant and air ﬁlling fractions
are large enough [3,21–23]. We calculate the 3D photonic
band dispersion and the photonic DOS for parameters
which are representative of the Si/SiO2 system (a typical
high-index contrast DBR) and of the GaAs/AlxGa1−xAs
system (with low index contrast). In particular, we de-
termine the conditions for the 1D and 2D photonic gaps
to overlap: since the 1D stop band of the DBR changes
upon patterning, and the 2D lattice of holes is formed
in a stratiﬁed medium, the overlap of the two band gaps
represents a sort of selfconsistency problem. The density
of states is found to be considerably reduced in corre-
spondence with the overlapping 2D and 1D gaps. Also,
the local density of states (which is the relevant quan-
tity for spontaneous emission rates) shows strong varia-

1

tions and additional reductions as a function of position.
These ﬁndings show that sizeable changes of spontaneous
emission rates and patterns of a local emitter embed-
ded in this anisotropic 3D structure should occur. The
present results may also serve as guidelines for experi-
mental groups which are attempting the fabrication of
these structures.

II. THEORETICAL METHOD

The geometry of the assumed structure is shown in
Fig.1a. The z axis is taken along the DBR growth di-
rection. We denote by l1, l2 the thicknesses of the two
DBR layers and by ε1, ε2 their respective dielectric con-
stants. The 2D pattern in the xy plane is taken to be
a triangular lattice of pitch a, with a basis in the unit
cell consisting of circular rods of radius r and dielectric
constant εh. In the present paper we consider only air
holes (εh = 1). The 3D Bravais lattice is simple hexago-
nal and the corresponding Brillouin zone with the main
symmetry points is shown in Fig.1b. The DBR period
L = l1 + l2 is taken as a ﬁxed length scale of the prob-
lem, in the sense that the photonic frequencies are given
in dimensionless units ωL/(2πc): indeed, if such a struc-
ture is grown, a single epitaxial DBR can be patterned
with various lateral periods at ﬁxed L. The 3D photonic
lattice is fully determined by the ratios l1/L, a/L, r/a as
well as by the dielectric constants ε1, ε2, εh.

In order to calculate the photonic band structure we
start from the second-order vector equation for the mag-
netic ﬁeld,

trix eigenvalue problem which contains the Fourier trans-
G,G′ of the inverse dielectric constant ε−1(r). This
form ε−1
is evaluated by the method of Ho, Chan and Soukoulis
[5], which consists of calculating the Fourier transform
εG,G′ of ε(r) and inverting numerically the resulting
matrix. This procedure yields a rapid numerical conver-
gence when an energy cutoﬀ is imposed for the number
of reciprocal lattice vectors.

In evaluating Eq. 3 the integral of the squared electric
ﬁeld is normalized to the unit cell volume, therefore DOS
and local DOS have the same dimensions and can be di-
rectly compared. In order to calculate both quantities we
adopt the linear tetrahedron method [24–26]. The DOS
is already converged with a mesh of about 400 k-points in
the irreducible wedge of the Brillouin zone (see Fig.1b).
Calculating the local DOS requires a mesh which spans
the whole Brillouin zone.

III. RESULTS

A. Si/SiO2 system

We ﬁrst consider the case of Si/SiO2 multilayers, mod-
eled by the dielectric constants ε1 = 12 and ε2 = 2. The
Si/SiO2 system has the appealing features that the di-
electric contrast is large, implying that a high rejection
ratio in the stop band is obtained with a small number
of periods, and that the etching of the two materials is
a technologically well controlled process. Another high-
index contrast system described by similar parameters is
GaAs/Alox (oxidized AlAs) [27].

In Fig. 2 we show the photonic bands and density of
states in the case of a Si layer width l1/L = 0.3: this is
close to the λ/4 condition for the multilayer (i.e., when
the two layer thicknesses are inversely proportional to
their refractive indices) and it maximizes the 1D gap
along the vertical direction. For the 2D lattice we choose
a/L = 1 and a hole radius r/a = 0.45: the latter value
produces a full photonic band gap in the pure 2D case,
when the refractive index contrast between dielectric and
air is strong enough [3,21–23]. Inspection of Fig. 2a shows
that a 1D gap along the Γ-A direction is indeed realized
around ωL/(2πc) = 0.4, but also that no 2D gap oc-
curs in the 2D projection of the Brillouin zone (Γ-M-K-Γ
directions). The reason is that the average dielectric con-
stant of the multilayer is too low to support a 2D band
gap. In order to achieve a 2D photonic gap, the λ/4 con-
dition must be abandoned and multilayers with a higher
Si fraction should be considered.

Concerning the photonic density of states, Fig. 2b
shows that the DOS increases like ω2 at small frequencies
(like for free photons) but pronounced structures occur
when the photonic band dispersion deviates from linear-
ity.
In this and the following ﬁgures for the DOS, the
dashed line represents the photon DOS in a homogeneous
and isotropic medium with the same average dielectric
constant εav of the etched DBR (Eq. 6), while the dotted
line is the DOS of a homogeneous but uniaxial medium,
whose dielectric tensor components are obtained from the
in-plane and Γ-A dispersions at small wavevector [28].
The dotted curve agrees with the numerically calculated
DOS in the low-frequency (long-wavelength) limit; the
dashed curve represents a reference DOS of an “average”
medium, and is useful in order to tell whether the DOS
of the etched DBR is reduced or increased with respect
to that of the average medium.

In Fig. 3 we show the photonic bands and DOS of
three Si/SiO2 multilayers with l1/L = 0.8 and a/L =
0.8, 1.2, 1.8: in all these cases the hole radius r/a = 0.45.
A full 2D band gap in the Γ-M-K-Γ plane can be recog-
nized in Fig. 3c (around ωL/(2πc) = 0.4) and in Fig. 3e
(around ωL/(2πc) = 0.27), since the average dielectric
constant of the multilayer is now close to the Si value. In
Fig. 3a, the 2D gap should coincide with the second-order
1D gap at the Γ point: however, the 2D gap is actually
closed by a photonic mode which starts at the lower edge
of the 1D gap at about ωL/(2πc) = 0.51. On increasing
the ratio a/L the 2D gap opens and decreases in energy,
and for a/L = 1.8 (Fig. 3e) it overlaps the ﬁrst-order 1D
gap at the A point.

In the case shown in Fig. 3e, it would seem that the 1D
gap along Γ-A is closed by a photonic mode which starts
at the lower 2D gap edge around ωL/(2πc) = 0.27. How-
ever, since this mode is nondegenerate, it does not have
the same symmetry of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (which
belongs to a twofold degenerate representation for any

wavevector k along Γ-A) and it cannot couple to an ex-
ternal beam incident along the Γ-A direction: this mode
is “symmetry uncoupled” [4,29–31] and it cannot have
any observable eﬀect on the reﬂectance for a plane wave
incident along the multilayer axis. Indeed, calculations of
the optical properties [32] indicate that the etched DBR
still behaves as a 1D reﬂector with a well-deﬁned stop
band along Γ-A and with a reﬂectivity which tends to
unity as the number of periods increases.

Concerning the photonic DOS, most features are simi-
lar to those of Fig. 2b already commented: however it is
interesting to observe that a pronounced minimum occurs
in correspondence with the 2D gap along Γ-M-K-Γ (e.g.,
around ωL/(2πc) = 0.27 in Fig. 3f).
In the frequency
window of the 2D gap the DOS is reduced not only with
respect to the “average” DOS (dashed line), but also in
comparison with the DOS of the long wavelength limit
(dotted line). The reduction of the DOS is particularly
pronounced in the cases of Figs. 3 (b) and (f), when the
2D gap overlaps the 1D gap. Therefore, a reduction of
spontaneous emission rates and a strong change of emis-
sion pattern is expected under these conditions: for the
parameters of Fig. 3 (e,f), since spontaneous emission
is suppressed in the xy plane and along the vertical di-
rection (due again to symmetry mismatch between the
emitted photon and the nondegenerate mode in the gap),
the emission of a point-like dipole will be preferentially
directed along the diagonals of the 3D structure.

In Fig. 4 we show the local density of states (LDOS)
for the “optimal” parameters of Fig. 3(e,f), i.e., when
the 2D and ﬁrst-order 1D gap overlap. The LDOS is
evaluated at three diﬀerent positions along a line con-
necting two neighboring holes in the midplane of layer 1.
The general behavior of the LDOS is similar that of the
DOS, with a ω2 increase at small frequencies, a reduction
in correspondence with the common 2D-1D gap and pro-
nounced structures at higher frequencies. As discussed in
connection with Eqs. 2,3, the DOS and LDOS are chosen
to have the same units and can be directly compared,
or in other words, the spatial average of the LDOS over
all positions gives again the DOS. It can be seen that
the LDOS is increased over the DOS of Fig. 3(f) for a
position inside a hole (Fig. 4a or b), while it is consider-
ably reduced at the center of the narrow dielectric region
between two holes (Fig. 4c). The combined eﬀects of a
common 2D-1D gaps and of a change in position (i.e., of
the electric ﬁeld proﬁle) results in a sizeable reduction of
the LDOS: at r = (0, 0.5a, 0) and ωL/(2πc) = 0.28, the
LDOS is equal to 4.4, compared to about 33 for the av-
erage medium. Therefore, the numerical results conﬁrm
that a strong reduction of spontaneous emission rates can
be achieved for an emitter embedded in an etched DBR,
when the parameters of the structure are properly cho-
sen.

B. GaAs/AlGaAs system

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We now consider the case of GaAs/AlGaAs multilay-
ers, modeled by the parameters ε1 = 11.7 and ε2 = 10.5:
the two values correspond to the dielectric constants of
GaAs and AlGaAs, respectively, at 1 eV [33]. Since the
two refractive indices are large and close to each other,
the photonic energies in dimensionless units do not de-
pend sensitively on the layer thicknesses l1, l2 and we
choose them to be equal, l1 = l2 = 0.5 L: this is also
close to the λ/4 condition for the multilayer. In Fig. 5
we show the photonic bands and DOS with these param-
eters, assuming two diﬀerent values a/L = 1.2 and 1.8
and taking again a large hole radius r/a = 0.45. A 2D
gap along Γ-M-K-Γ is formed (around ωL/(2πc) = 0.36
in Fig. 5a, around ωL/(2πc) = 0.24 in Fig. 5c) and in
the case of a/L = 1.8 it overlaps the small ﬁrst-order
1D gap at the A point. Like in the case of Fig. 3e, the
nondegenerate mode starting at the lower edge of the 2D
gap is not coupled to a plane wave incident along the
Γ-A direction and it will not aﬀect the normal-incidence
reﬂectivity. Concerning the density of states, there is
again an increase like ω2 at small frequencies followed
by several structures. A reduction of the DOS occurs in
correspondence with the 2D gap, with a minimum which
is somewhat less pronounced than for the etched Si/SiO2
multilayers: this is due to the smaller refractive index
contrast between GaAs and AlGaAs. Changes of spon-
taneous emission rates and patterns will also occur in the
GaAs/AlGaAs system, but to a lesser extent than for a
high index contrast structure.

Systematic calculations of photonic bands, total and
local DOS have been undertaken for the hexagonal pho-
tonic structure corresponding to a distributed Bragg re-
ﬂector patterned with a triangular lattice of holes. A few
representative examples have been shown for the case of
Si/SiO2 and GaAs/AlGaAs multilayers, focusing on the
most favorable situations for achieving a full 2D photonic
gap in the Γ-M-K-Γ plane. The parameters for which
the 2D gap overlaps the 1D gap formed along the multi-
layer axis have been determined. A nondegenerate mode
whose dispersion along Γ-A overlaps the 1D gap is sym-
metry uncoupled from a plane wave propagating along
Γ-A and it will not aﬀect the normal-incidence reﬂectiv-
ity.

The conditions for the overlap of a 2D and a 1D gap
are rather restrictive and require a careful structure de-
sign: the average refractive index of the multilayer has
to be large (thus the layer thicknesses must not obey
the λ/4 condition) and the air fraction of the 2D lattice
must be such that a full 2D gap develops. The overlap
of the 2D with the ﬁrst-order 1D gap is found to occur
1.8 for the investigated structure, which
around a/L
is favourable in view of patterning the multilayers with
lithography and etching techniques.

∼

The photonic density of states has a pronounced min-
imum in correspondence with the common 2D-1D gap,
particularly for the case of the Si/SiO2 system. The local
DOS depends strongly on the position and is considerably
reduced at the center of the dielectric veins between two
holes. The combined eﬀects of overlapping 2D-1D gaps
and of the position dependent DOS will yield a strong re-
duction of spontaneous emission rates and considerable
changes of emission patterns, with a redistribution of the

6

emission mainly along the diagonal direction of the 3D
structure.

Speciﬁc calculations of the optical properties of etched
DBRs (reﬂectivity and spontaneous emission) are under-
way [32]. The anisotropic structure made of the etched
DBR is concluded to be an interesting possibility for the
realization of 3D photonic crystals where a controlled in-
troduction of defects is possible and whose spontaneous
emission properties can be tailored to a large extent.

[28] The photonic DOS in a uniaxial medium is obtained by
summing the DOS of ordinary and extraordinary modes:
if ρ0 is the free-space DOS and nk (n⊥) is the refractive
index for a polarization parallel (perpendicular) to the
optic axis, the DOS is given by ρ = (n3

⊥ + n⊥n2

k)ρ0.

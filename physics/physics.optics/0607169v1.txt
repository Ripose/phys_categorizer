Abstract— We investigate slow-light via stimulated Brillouin
scattering in a room temperature optical ﬁber that is pumped
by a spectrally broadened laser. Broadening the spectrum of the
pump ﬁeld increases the linewidth ∆ωp of the Stokes amplifying
resonance, thereby increasing the slow-light bandwidth. One
physical bandwidth limitation occurs when the linewidth becomes
several times larger than the Brillouin frequency shift ΩB so that
the anti-Stokes absorbing resonance cancels out substantially the
Stokes amplifying resonance and hence the slow-light effect. We
ﬁnd that partial overlap of the Stokes and anti-Stokes resonances
can actually lead to an enhancement of the slow-light delay
- bandwidth product when ∆ωp ≃ 1.3ΩB . Using this general
approach, we increase the Brillouin slow-light bandwidth to
over 12 GHz from its nominal linewidth of ∼30 MHz obtained
for monochromatic pumping. We controllably delay 75-ps-long
pulses by up to 47 ps and study the data pattern dependence of
the broadband SBS slow-light system.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HERE has been great interest

in slowing the propa-
gation speed of optical pulses (so-called slow light)
using coherent optical methods [1]. Slow-light techniques have
many applications for future optical communication systems,
including optical buffering, data synchronization, optical mem-
ories, and signal processing [2], [3]. It is usually achieved
with resonant effects that cause large normal dispersion in a
narrow spectral region (approximately equal to the resonance
width), which increases the group index and thus reduces the
group velocity of optical pulses. Optical resonances associated
with stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) [5]– [9], stimulated
Raman scattering [10] and parametric ampliﬁcation [11] in
optical ﬁbers have been used recently to achieve slow light.

The width of the resonance enabling the slow-light effect
limits the minimum duration of the optical pulse that can
be effectively delayed without much distortion, and therefore
limits the maximum data rate of the optical system [12]. In
this regard, ﬁber-based SBS slow light is limited to data rates
less than a few tens of Mb/s due to the narrow Brillouin
resonance width (
30 MHz in standard single-mode optical
ﬁbers). Recently, Herr´aez et al. [13] increased the SBS slow-
light bandwidth to about 325 MHz by broadening the spectrum
of the SBS pump ﬁeld. Here, we investigate the fundamental
limitations of this method and extend their work to achieve
a SBS slow-light bandwidth as large as 12.6 GHz, thereby

supporting data rates of over 10 Gb/s [14]. With our setup,
we delay 75-ps pulses by up to 47 ps and study the data pulse
quality degradation in the broadband slow-light system.

This paper is organized as follows. The next section de-
scribes the broadband-pump method for increasing the SBS
slow-light bandwidth and discuss its limitations. Section III
presents the experimental results of broadband SBS slow light,
where we investigate the delay of single and multiple pulses
passing through the system. From the multiple-pulse data, we
estimate the degradation of the eye-diagram as a function of
delay, a ﬁrst step toward understanding performance penalties
incurred by this slow-light method. Section IV concludes the
paper.

II. SBS SLOW LIGHT

In a SBS slow-light system, a continuous-wave (CW) laser
beam (angular frequency ωp) propagates through an optical
ﬁber, which we take as the
z-direction, giving rise to
amplifying and absorbing resonances due to the process of
electrostriction. A counterpropagating beam (along the +z-
direction) experiences ampliﬁcation in the vicinity of the
Stokes frequency ωs = ωp
ΩB, where ΩB is the Brillouin
frequency shift, and absorption in the vicinity of the anti-
Stokes frequency ωas = ωp + ΩB.

A pulse (denoted interchangeably by the “probe” or “data”
pulse) launched along the +z-direction experiences slow (fast)
light propagation when its carrier frequency ω is set to the
amplifying (absorbing) resonance [5]– [9]. In the small-signal
regime,
the output pulse spectrum is related to the input
spectrum through the relation E(z = L, ω) = E(z =
0, ω) exp[g(ω)L/2], where L is the ﬁber length and g(ω) is
the complex SBS gain function. The complex gain function is
the convolution of the intrinsic SBS gain spectrum ˜g0(ω) and
the power spectrum of the pump ﬁeld Ip(ωp) and is given by

the gain parameter and exp(G0) is the small-signal gain [5]–
[9]. The SBS slow-light bandwidth is given approximately by
ΓB/2π (FWHM in cycles/s).

Equation (1) shows that the width of the SBS amplifying
resonance can be increased by using a broadband pump.
Regardless of the shape of the pump power spectrum, the
resultant SBS spectrum is approximately equal to the pump
spectrum when the pump bandwidth is much larger than the
intrinsic SBS linewidth. This increased bandwidth comes at
some expense: the SBS gain coefﬁcient scales inversely with
the bandwidth, which must be compensated using a higher
pump intensity or using a ﬁber with larger g0.

To develop a quantitative model of the broadband SBS slow-
light, we consider a pump source with a Gaussian power
spectrum, as realized in our experiment. To simplify the
analysis, we ﬁrst consider the case when the width of the
pump-spectrum broadened Stokes and anti-Stokes resonances
is small in comparison to ΩB, which is the condition of the ex-
periment of Ref. [13]. Later, we will relax this assumption and
consider the case when ∆ωp

begin to overlap, which is the case of our experiment.

the delay at the center of the Stokes resonance. Therefore,
there is an optimum value of the resonance linewidth that
maximizes the delay. Figure 2 shows the relative delay as a

the optimum value occurs at ∆ωp
1.3 ΩB and that the
delay falls off only slowly for large resonance bandwidths.
This result demonstrates that it is possible to obtain practical
slow-light bandwidths that can somewhat exceed a few times
ΩB.

III. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS

As discussed above, the SBS slow-light pulse delay Tdel is
proportional to G/Γ. The decrease in G that accompanies the
increase in ∆ωp needs to be compensated by increasing the
ﬁber length, pump power, and/or using highly nonlinear optical
ﬁbers (HNLF). In our experiment, we use a 2-km-long HNLF
(OFS, Denmark) that has a smaller effective modal area and
therefore a larger SBS gain coefﬁcient g0 when compared with
a standard single-mode optical ﬁber. We also use a high-power
Erbium-doped ﬁber ampliﬁer (EDFA, IPG Model EAD-1K-C)
to provide enough pump power to achieve appreciable gain.

To achieve a broadband pump source, we directly modulate
the injection current of a distributed feedback (DFB) single-
mode semiconductor laser. The change in injection current
changes the refractive index of the laser gain medium and
thus the laser frequency, which is proportional to the current-
modulation amplitude. We use an arbitrary waveform gener-
ator (TEK, AWG2040) to create a Gaussian noise source at
a 400-MHz clock frequency, which is ampliﬁed and summed
with the DC injection current of a 1550-nm DFB laser diode
(Sumitomo Electric, STL4416) via a bias-T with an input
impedance of 50 Ohms. The resultant laser power spectrum is
approximately Gaussian. The pump power spectral bandwidth
is adjusted by changing the peak-peak voltage of the noise
source.

The experiment setup is shown schematically in Fig. 3.
Broadband laser light from the noise-current-modulated DFB
laser diode is ampliﬁed by the EDFA and enters the HNLF
via a circulator. The Brillouin frequency shift of the HNLF is
measured to be ΩB/2π = 9.6 GHz. CW light from another
tunable laser is amplitude-modulated to form data pulses that
counter-propagate in the HNLF with respect to the pump
wave. Two ﬁber polarization controllers (FPC) are used to
maximize the transmission through the intensity modulator
and the SBS gain in the slow-light medium. The ampliﬁed
and delayed data pulses are routed out of the system via
a circulator and detected by a fast photoreceiver (12-GHz

bandwidth, New Focus Model 1544B) and displayed on a 50-
GHz-bandwidth sampling oscilloscope (Agilent 86100A). The
pulse delay is determined from the waveform traces displayed
on the oscilloscope.

To quantify the effect of the bandwidth-broadened pump
laser on the SBS process, we measured the broadened SBS
gain spectra by scanning the wavelength of a CW laser
beam and measuring the resultant transmission. Figure 4(a)
shows an example of the spectra. It is seen that the features
overlap and that Eq. (4) does an excellent job in predicting
our observations, where we adjusted Γ to obtain the best
ﬁt. We ﬁnd Γ/2π = 12.6 GHz (∆ωp/ΩB
0.8), which is
somewhat smaller than the optimum value. We did not attempt
to investigate higher bandwidths to avoid overdriving the laser
with the broadband signal. This non-ideality could be avoided
by using a laser with a greater tuning sensitivity.

Based on the measured SBS bandwidth, we chose a

75 ps (T0
a 14 Gb/s electrical pulse generator. Figures 4(b)-(d) show the
experimental results for such input pulses. Figure 4(b) shows
the pulse delay as a function of the gain experienced by the
pulse, which is determined by measuring the change in the
pulse height. A 47-ps SBS slow-light delay is achieved at a
pump power of
580 mW that is coupled into the HNLF,
which gives a gain of about 14 dB. It is seen that the pulse
delay scales linearly with the gain, demonstrating the ability
to control all-optically the slow-light delay. The dashed line in
Fig. 4(b) is obtained with Eq. (5), which tends to underestimate
the time delay that is enhanced by the contribution from the
anti-Stokes line (see Fig. 2). Figure 4(c) shows the width of the
delayed pulse as a function of gain. The data pulse is seen to
be broadened as it is delayed, where it is broadened by about
40% at a delay of about 47 ps. The dashed curve in Fig. 4(c)
is obtained with Eq. (6). Figure 4(d) shows the waveforms

IV. CONCLUSION

In summary, we have increased the bandwidth of SBS slow
light in an optical ﬁber to over 12 GHz by spectrally broaden-
ing the pump laser, thus demonstrating that it can be integrated
into existing data systems operating over 10 Gb/s. We observed
a pattern dependence whose power penalty increases with
increasing slow-light delay; research is underway to decrease
this dependence and improve the performance of the high-
bandwidth SBS slow-light system.

penalty vs. normalized time delay for 13.3 Gb/s and 10 Gb/s bit-rate data.

To investigate how the pulse broadening seen in Fig. 4(c)
might impact a communication system, we examine the pattern
dependence of the pulse distortion. For example, in NRZ data
format, a single ‘1’ pulse has a different gain than consecutive
‘1’ pulses [17]. The pattern-dependent gain could induce a
different ‘1’ level in the whole data stream, while pattern-
dependent delay can lead to a large timing jitter.

−

Figures 5(a)-(c) show the delayed pulse waveforms of three
simple NRZ data patterns with a bit-rate of 14 Gb/s. It is
clear that the pulses overlap when they are closer to each
other, which degrades the system performance. To quantify
the signal quality degradation, we use Q-factor (signal qual-
ity factor) of input and output pulses, which is deﬁned as
m0)/(σ1 + σ0), where m1, m0, σ1, σ0 are the mean
(m1
and standard deviation of the signal samples when a ‘1’ or
‘0’ is received. We examine the Q-penalty (decrease in Q-
factor) produced by the broadband SBS slow-light system by
numerical simulations. Figure 5(d) shows the Q-penalty as
a function of time delay for 10 Gb/s and 13.3 Gb/s bit-rate
data streams, respectively. In the simulations, the ‘1’ pulse is
assumed to be Gaussian-shaped with a pulsewidth (FWHM)
of the bit time (100 ps for 10 Gb/s, 75 ps for 13.3 Gb/s).
The slow-light delay is normalized by the bit time so that
Q-penalties in different bit-rate systems can be compared. It
is seen that the Q-penalty increases approximately linearly
with the normalized delay, and that the 13.3 Gb/s data rate
incurs a higher penalty than the 10 Gb/s data rate. The penalty
is higher at the higher data rate because the higher-speed
signal is more vulnerable to the pattern dependence, especially
when the slow-light bandwidth is comparable to the signal
bandwidth. Error-free transmission (BER < 10−9) is found at
a normalized delay of 0.25 or less. In an optimized system, it is

ABSTRACT: Refraction of obliquely incident plane waves due to the interface of a vacuous

half–space and a half–space occupied by a simply moving, nondissipative, isotropic dielectric–

magnetic medium is considered, when the medium’s velocity lies parallel to the interface and in

the plane of incidence. Counterposition of the refracted wavevector and time–averaged Poynting

vector occurs when the medium’s velocity is suﬃciently large in magnitude and makes an obtuse

angle with the incident wavevector. The counterposition induced by relative motion occurs

whether the refraction is negative or positive when the medium is at rest.

Keywords: Amphoteric refraction, counterposition, negative refraction, positive refraction

1. INTRODUCTION

When a plane wave is incident upon the planar interface of two homogeneous mediums,

the refracted wavevector and time–averaged Poynting vector can emerge on opposite sides of

the normal to the interface. This phenomenon is called counterposition. Conditions for the

1

occurrence of counterposition in uniaxial dielectric–magnetic mediums have been established

[1]. Under the title of amphoteric refraction, counterposition has been confused with negative

refraction [2]. Refraction — whether negative or positive — concerns the orientation of the

refracted wavevector relative to the normal to the interface, as per a law often attributed to

Willebrord van Snel van Royen [3]. The orientation of the refracted time–averaged Poynting

vector is irrelevant to whether or not the refraction is negative or positive.

In this Letter, we establish the prospects for counterposition due to the interface of a vacuous

half–space and a half–space occupied by a simply moving, nondissipative, isotropic dielectric–

magnetic medium, when the medium’s velocity lies parallel to the interface and in the plane

of incidence.

In particular, we show that counterposition and negative refraction are indeed

distinct. For background details of planewave propagation in moving mediums, the reader is

referred to standard works [3, 4, 5].

2. ANALYSIS

Suppose that a plane wave is launched with wavevector ki = ki

ˆki from vacuum towards

a half–space occupied by an isotropic, nondissipative, dielectric–magnetic medium. Let this

medium move at constant velocity v = vˆv, parallel to the interface and in the plane of incidence.

With respect to an inertial frame of reference that moves with the same velocity v with respect to

the laboratory frame of reference wherein ki is speciﬁed, the refracting medium is characterized

by relative permittivity ǫr and relative permeability µr. The condition ǫrµr ≥
order to exclude the possibility of evanescent plane waves.

Now let us turn to the scenario wherein ǫr < 0 and µr < 0, as schematically represented in

direction of motion as β increases.

3. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Thus, counterposition may be induced in an isotropic dielectric–magnetic medium by relative

motion at constant velocity — whether the medium is positively or negatively refracting when

at rest. Thereby, the distinction between counterposition and negative refraction is further

emphasized [2, 6]. Also, in the scenario considered here, we note that the phase velocity of

the refracted plane wave is positive when positive refraction occurs and negative when negative

refraction occurs. Hence, negative phase velocity is not induced by relative motion parallel to

the medium interface [7]. In the absence of relative motion (i.e., β = 0) the refracted wavevector

and time–averaged Poynting vector are parallel for ǫr, µr > 0 and anti–parallel for ǫr, µr < 0,

and accordingly counterposition cannot occur, as is conﬁrmed by Figs. 2, 3, 5 and 6.

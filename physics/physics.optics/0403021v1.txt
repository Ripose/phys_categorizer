We present a study of orbital angular momentum transfer from pump to down-converted beams
in a type-II Optical Parametric Oscillator. Cavity and anisotropy eﬀects are investigated and
demostrated to play a central role in the transverse mode dynamics. While the idler beam can
oscillate in a Laguerre-Gauss mode, the crystal birefringence induces an astigmatic eﬀect in the
signal beam that prevents the resonance of such mode.

INTRODUCTION

Early experiments have shown that circularly polar-

description of light, this angular momentum is associated
with the spin of the photon. More recently a signiﬁcant
attention has been given to the study of the orbital angu-
lar momentum of light, associated with phase singulari-
ties in the wavefront. In a paraxial description of wave
propagation, it is found that Laguerre-Gaussian beams
carry orbital angular momentum. Such beams can be
experimentally produced either through astigmatic mode
conversion with cylindrical lenses [2, 3] or through holo-
graphic techniques [4, 5, 6]. While the holographic tech-
niques are simpler, the astigmatic mode converters can
operate with high power.

It has been demonstrated that parametric down con-
version with free propagating beams conserves the Or-
bital Angular Momentum (OAM) of the pump beam. In
the quantum optical domain this was observed through
intensity correlation measurements, where twin-photon
coincidences were obtained whenever the conservation
condition was fulﬁlled [7]. In the classical counterpart, a
stimulating beam was introduced and parametric ampliﬁ-
cation was shown to be conditioned to OAM conservation
[8]. Similar eﬀects have already been observed in second
harmonic generation [9, 10].

So far, little attention has been given to OAM con-
servation in intracavity nonlinear coupling. Many stud-
ies have been done with transverse multimode OPOs,
showing interesting possibilities in pattern formation and
quantum images for cavities with degenerate transverse
modes, like planar [11, 12] and spherical cavities [13, 14].
Moreover, experiments have shown pattern formation in
confocal [15] and concentric [16] cavities, and oscillation
in modes with higher order than the fundamental are
common in many diﬀerent experiments [17, 18].

Apart from some theoretical studies on generation of
phase singularities with nonlinear optical eﬀects [19, 20],
only a few experimental results have been published in
this subject, and to our knowledge, there is no result
showing the necessary conditions for intracavity OAM

transfer from the pump to the down-converted beams.
In the present work, we study the OAM transfer in a
non-degenetrate, type-II Optical Parametric Oscillator
(OPO). We show the conditions that must be satisﬁed
for the OAM transfer, allowing one of the down-converted
beams to oscillate with the same phase singularity of the
pump beam. As we shall see, the astigmatism caused
by the crystal birrefringence plays a central role in the
selection of the beam oscillating in the Laguerre-Gauss
mode.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The experimental setup is shown in Fig.1. The OPO
is made by two spherical mirrors M1 and M2, with equal
curvatures Rm = 13mm.
Inside the cavity, we have a
KTP crystal (by Cristal Laser) 10 mm long, cut for non-
critical phase matching in 532 nm to 1064 nm down con-
version at room temperature. In this case, the crystallo-
graphic axes (x, y, z) of the cristal are oriented as follows.
The z axis of the crystal is vertically oriented while the
propagation direction lies on the horizontal plane (xy).
The x axis forms an angle φ = 23.5◦ with respect to the
propagation direction.

The mirrors have high reﬂectance for the infrared (R
= 99.8 % @ 1064 nm), and a small transmition at the
pump wavelength (R = 92 % @ 532 nm). Crystal losses
in the infrared comes mainly from surface reﬂection, re-
duced by anti-reﬂective coating (R = 0.1 %), since crystal
absorption at this wavelength is small (0.05 %). For the
pump, we have reﬂection losses (R = 0.5 %) and crystal
absorption, increased by gray-tracking eﬀects [21]. The
cavity length is controlled by a piezo actuator on the
mirror, and the cavity is kept nearly confocal, in order to
help the alignment and reduce the consequences of the
walk-oﬀ.

The OPO is pumped by the second harmonic of a
Nd:YAG laser (Lightwave 142). This laser generates a
TEM00 gaussian beam, that is converted to a nearly
Hermite-Gauss TEM01 beam [22]. With a telescope
formed by two cylindrical lenses, we implemented a mode
converter that produces a Laguerre-Gauss beam [2], with

output of the type-II triply resonant OPO. The mode con-
verter introduced in the pump beam is not shown

a good cylindrical simetry for the intensity and a phase
singularity in the center. This phase singularity was ev-
idenced by the self interference pattern obtained in a
Michelson interferometer.
In Fig.2 we show the trans-
verse proﬁle and interference pattern of the beam used
to pump the OPO. The resulting pump power is 60 mW.
The beam is horizontally polarized, and mode matched
to the cavity with the help of coated lenses. Although

in type-II OPOs, the idler beam polarization is horizon-
tal, and the signal beam has a vertical polarization, al-
ligned to the crystal z axis. Each down converted beam
is sent into a Michelson interferometer made by a nonpo-
larizing 50/50 beam splitter (BS) and two ﬂat mirrors,
in order to produce interference fringes that can reveal
the existence of a phase singularity. The two outputs are
recombined in another polarizign cube (PBS) and sent
onto a CCD camera, that is used to register either the
interference pattern or the intensity proﬁle of the beam.
The output power of the pump and infrared beams is
measured as the cavity length is scanned. The corre-
sponding resonance peaks are shown in Fig.3. A wide
peak is obtained for the pump, over which narrow dips
appear due to the pump depletion in diﬀerent oscillation
regimes. The resonance peaks for the infrared are also
shown in Fig.3. They coincide with the depletion dips in
the pump resonance. Expanding the curve, we can ob-
serve that the depletion dips have a parabolic shape, in
good agreement with the depletion expected for a triply
resonant OPO [23]. From the ﬁnesse of the resonance
peak for the pump, we measure 29 % of internal losses in
the cavity. For signal and idler modes, the ﬁtting of the
parabolic depletion gives a value of 1 % for the infrared
losses. The threshold power for parametric oscillation is
around 20 mW. The OPO could be held in the oscillating

self interference patterns. These images are shown in
Fig.4. They are lebeled in correspondence to the oscilla-

III. PARAXIAL WAVES IN A
BIRREFRINGENT CRYSTAL

In a type-II down conversion, we use the crystal bir-
refringence to achieve the desired phase matching con-
dition [25, 26]. It was shown by many authors that the
paraxial equation, from which we can derive the propaga-
tion modes of a beam in free space or isotropic medium,
will change when we work with an anisotropic medium
[27, 28]. Here we will extend the study of Fleck and Feit
[29] of paraxial propagation in uniaxial crystals to the
biaxial case, adapting their description to the case of a
crystal inside a cavity. Our aim is to reduce the wave
equations to the paraxial wave equations that deﬁne the
Hermite-Gauss modes coupled to the resonances of a lin-
ear cavity.

Let us deﬁne the crystalographic axis as (x, y, z). The
KTP crystal used in our experiment is a quasi-uniaxial

index for x(y, z) polarized light. Since the displacement
vector D satisﬁes
D = 0, we can write the wave

Notice that for an uniaxial crystal (nx = ny) we recover

down converted pump photons. In image 2, the shape
of the idler beam is intermediary between a ﬁrst order
Laguerre-Gauss and a diagonal ﬁrst order Hermite-Gauss
modes. A vortex can still be observed through the inter-
ference fringes. In both cases, the signal beam remains in
the fundamental gaussian mode. Following the Poincar´e-
sphere representation proposed in Ref.[24], we can look at
the idler mode shown in image 2 as an orbital equivalent
of an elliptical polarization.

An interesting eﬀect appears in image 3. In this situ-
ation, the signal beam oscillates in the transverse mode
with higher order, but with no angular momentum. The
output is a pure Hermite-Gauss TEM01 mode, vertically
oriented, while the idler remains in the fundamental gaus-
sian mode. Therefore, the orbital angular momentum is
not conserved in the parametric down conversion process,
and the crystal is expected to suﬀer a twisting torque.
This eﬀect is analogous to the mechanical torque applied
to a quater waveplate used for light polarization conver-
sion [1], or to a pair of cylindrical lenses used for trans-
verse mode conversion [2].

The reason for this assimetry in the OAM conservation
of the pump can be explained when the propagation of
paraxial beams in anisotropic media is investigated and
the eﬀect of cavity mode selection is considered.

This angle is represented in Fig.5. It is related to the well
known walk-oﬀ eﬀect, which appears as a consequence of
the crystal anisotropy. However, as we shall see shortly,
the z polarized ﬁeld will also have an anisotropic eﬀect
when the propagation of a transversely ﬁnite beam is con-
sidered. This eﬀect appears as an astigmatic deformation
of the beam during the propagation along the crystal.

B. Paraxial propagation

On ther other hand, to obtain a direct solution of eq.(1)
for a paraxial beam propagation is not so straightforward
and some carefull aproximations have to be made to un-
couple the diferential equations for each polarization. For
the z component, the wave equation has the form

A paraxial solution Ez = uz(x′, y′, z)e−inz k0x

φ = 23.5◦. A rotated reference frame (x′, y′, z) can be
used to describe the propagation inside the crystal. The

A. Plane wave analysis

Two orthogonally polarized plane wave solutions prop-
agating along x′ can be found for Eqs.(3). One with
= 0 (z polarized) and another
Ex = Ey = 0 and Ez 6
polarized in the xy plane (Ez = 0). For the z polarized
solution, only the last of Eqs.(3) remain and its solution
is

Ez = E0z ei nzk0 x

.

The plane wave solution polarized on the xy plane can
be found by making Ez = 0 in the ﬁrst two of Eqs.(3).
This solution is of the kind

E = E0 ei (kx x+ky y) ,

where E0 = E0x ˆx + E0y ˆy. From substitution of Eq.(6)
in the ﬁrst one of Eqs.(3), we ﬁnd

cients of the transverse second-order derivatives:

n2
z
n2 ∂2

z uz = 2 i nzk0 ∂x′uz .

(12)

The assimetry between the transverse coordinates y′
and z appears as a rescaling of the z coordinate. This
means that the optical beam follows an astigmatic prop-
agation inside the crystal with diferent diﬀraction scales
for each transverse coordinate. Let us separate the
dependence of uz on y′ and z making uz(x′, y′, z) =
Uz(x′, y′) Vz(x′, z), in order to obtain two paraxial wave
equations for the beam diﬀraction in each transverse di-
rection:

∂2
y′ Uz = 2inzk0 ∂x′ Uz ,

n2
z
n2 ∂2

z Vz = 2inzk0 ∂x′ Vz .

(13)

When calculating the propagation of the beam through
an OPO cavity, this diﬀraction assimetry can be seen as a
diﬀerent eﬀective length of the crystal for each transverse
dependence of the mode function. For a crystal with
length ℓ, the eﬀective length for the Uz propagation will
be ℓ/nz, as usual in the treatment of beam propagation
through an uniform crystal
[26, 33]. For Vz, the eﬀec-
tive length it will be ℓnz/n2, resulting in an assimetry in
the eﬀective cavity length for each transverse evolution.
The calculation of the cavity geometry, and the resulting
beam parameters expressed by the Rayleigh length xR,
will therefore diﬀer for the two transverse coordinates.

Let us now turn to the paraxial solution for the ﬁeld
polarized on the xy plane. Since a plane wave solution
with Ez = 0 can be found, it is natural to concieve a
paraxial solution for which Ez is negligeable. Therefore,
if we choose α = n2
x in Eq.(1) and use the rotated coordi-
nates, we obtain the following propagation equation for

much smaller than the one present in the z polarized
ﬁeld. Therefore, while the z polarization has a signiﬁcant
astigmatism but no walk-oﬀ, the xy polarization presents
walk-oﬀ and a small astigmatism. From now on we shall
designate the xy polarized ﬁeld as the extraordinary wave
and the z polarized ﬁeld as the ordinary wave.

As we made for the z component, we can try a factor-
ized solution of the paraxial wave equation (16) of the
form uy = Uy(x′, y′′) Vy(x′, z) , so that

(17)

Thus, the paraxial propagation inside the crystal is well
described by Eqs.(13) and (17) for the ordinary and ex-
traordinary waves respectively. A paraxial equation for
the x component of the extraordinary wave can be ob-
tained on the same lines leading to Eq.(17).

IV. ASTIGMATIC CAVITY

All scalling parameters appearing in Eqs.(13) and (17)
can be absorbed by a suitable deﬁnition of an eﬀective
wave number kef f for each transverse direction and for
each polarization. This brings Eqs.(13) and (17) to the
general form

∂2
y U (x, y) = 2ikef f ∂xU (x, y) .

The normalized solution of Eq.(18) is [35]

diﬀerent propagation length in each case.

Let us now consider the refractive index of the KTP
crystal at 1064 nm (nx = 1.7404, ny = 1.7479, nz =
1.8296) and 532 nm (nx = 1.7797, ny = 1.7897, nz =
1.8877), according to the manufacturer, Cristal Laser
S.A. We have, for the extraordinary wave, a refractive in-
dex n(1064nm) = 1.7467 and n(532nm) = 1.7881. From
the distance L0 = 17.4mm between the mirrors in our
near-confocal cavity, and the crystal length ℓ = 10.0mm,
we can calculate the eﬀective length L of the cavity for
each transverse mode, and for each polarization, in the
infrared case. Using the relation

The phase added in a round trip depends on the order
of the Hermite-Gauss T EMmn mode resonating inside
the cavity. The total Gouy phase for this mode is

Φ = (m + 1/2)Φz + (n + 1/2)Φy.

(24)

From the calculated values of the Gouy phase shift, we
see that there will be a small phase diference between
the TEM01 and the TEM10 modes. This diﬀerence will
result in a splitting of the resonance position. At 1064
nm, this separation is of 82mrad for the ordinary wave,
and 6mrad for the extraordinary one.

In order to study this splitting, we pumped the OPO
with a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) mode obtained with an
astigmatic mode converter [2]. The LG mode is the su-
perposition of two HG modes orthogonally oriented, that
is, a TEM01 and a TEM10 mode. Once the OPO cav-
ity is scanned, a single resonance peak is expected if the

6

cavity is degenerate for the two TEM modes. Otherwise,
two resonance peaks are expected, one corresponding to
each TEM mode. In Fig.6, we show the resonance peak
of a high ﬁnesse cavity for a 532 nm LG pump. The
polarization of the pump laser was rotated in order to
provide both, the ordinary and extraordinary waves. For
the vertical polarization (ordinary wave), a double res-
onance is observed as expected. This splitting shows
a round trip phase diﬀerence of 88mrad, in reasonable
good agreement with the predicted 93mrad for 532 nm.
On the other hand, for horizontal polarization (extraordi-
nary wave), the LG resonance presents a single peak. In
this case, the splitting is expected to be around 8mrad,
well below the resolution of the cavity used for this mea-
surement.

FIG. 6: Cavity resonance peak for a pump LG beam with
a) horizontal (extraordinary) polarization and b) vertical (or-
dinary) polarization. In the second case the resonance peak
splits in two, clearly showing the simetry breaking between
the two HG components of the LG beam.

From this analysis we conclude that the OPO can sup-
port the oscillation of an LG mode for the extraordi-
nary wave, since its HG components have a degenerate
(or quasi-degenerate) resonance frequency. On the other
hand, an LG mode in the ordinary wave cannot oper-
ate because its HG components will not have the same
resonance frequency. This explains the results shown in
Fig.4, that is, the orbital angular momentum (OAM) is

transferred from the pump laser (extraordinary wave) to
the idler mode (extraordinary wave) but not to the sig-
nal mode (ordinary wave). Notice that, under our ex-
perimental conditions, only one of the down converted
modes oscillates in a high order transverse mode, while
the other one oscillates in the fundamental transverse
mode. So, the OAM exchange between pump, signal and
idler modes is governed by the cavity dynamics under the
crystal anisotropy, involving polarization and transverse
proﬁle aspects.

V. THEORETICAL MODEL

Transverse multimode operation of OPOs has already
been theoretically discussed in Ref.[33]. The pump beam
can excite many diﬀerent cavity modes for signal and
idler, but in general it is the one with the lowest thresh-
old that survives. Therefore, modes with best recover-
ing integral should oscillate. To extend this description
to our experiment, we must take into account the walk-
oﬀ and the astigmatism due to the crystal anisotropy.
As we have seen, the astigmatism will introduce a phase
shift between the two Hermite-Gauss components of the
Laguerre-Gauss beam. We can choose to treat the prob-
lem either in the Laguerre-Gauss basis or in the Hermite-
Gauss one. For the Laguerre-Gauss basis, the astigma-
tism couples the right-handed beam to the left-handed
one. In the Hermite-Gauss basis, this coupling implies
in a phase diﬀerence between the two ﬁrst order modes.
Here we chose to work in the Hermite-Gauss basis, but
the change of basis is straightforward.

In order to study the dynamics of the relevant trans-
verse modes, we shall consider the normalized mode func-
tions uj k(x′, y′, z), where j = p, s, i for pump, signal and
idler respectively, and k = 0, h, v for the Hermite-Gauss
TEM00, TEM10 and TEM01 respectively. The overlap
integrals,

Λk l m =

up k u∗

s l u∗

i m dx′ dy′ dz ,

(25)

Z Z Z

play an important role in the dynamics since they deter-
mine the transverse mode coupling. The mode functions
uj k(x′, y′, z) are given by Eqs.(13), (17) and (19), where
astigmatism and walk-oﬀ eﬀects are taken into account.
The walk-oﬀ is slightly diﬀerent for pump (4.1 mrad) and
idler (3.2 mrad), and the signiﬁcant astigmatism occurs
in the z direction of the signal mode. The integrals are
calculated in the whole crystal volume.

With the overlap integrals, we can obtain the dynamic
equations for the transverse mode amplitudes. From all
possible combinations of oscillating modes, the cavity
parity will restrict the number of transverse modes for
a given longitudional mode. If there were no anisotropic
eﬀects, with a ﬁrst order Laguerre-Gaussian pump mode,
which is odd, signal and idler must have oposite parities
in order to give a nonvanishing overlap integral. There-
fore, for isotropic propagation, if signal oscillates in a

7

ﬁrst order mode, idler must oscillate in the fundamen-
tal one, and vice-versa. In principle, this parity selection
brakes down for an anisotropic medium specially due to
walk-oﬀ. However, when the overlap integrals are calcu-
lated, we can see that the integrals for odd combinations
of modes, like (v, 0, 0) or (v, v, v) for example, are indeed
much smaller than those obtained with an even combina-
tion like (v, v, 0). This allows us to neglect many of the
mode couplings and restrict the number of dynamic equa-
tions. Two kinds of operation regimes are observed: ei-
ther the signal beam oscillates in the fundamental TEM00
mode, while the idler lies in the TEM01 and 10 subspace
(peaks 1, 2 and 4 in Fig.3), or the idler beam oscillates
in the TEM00 mode (peak 3 in Fig.3). Let us describe
these regimes separately.

A. Signal beam operating in the TEM00 mode

In this case, the set of dynamic equations for pump,

signal and idler transverse mode amplitudes is:

where the subindices p, s and i refer to pump, signal
and idler respectively, and 0, v and h refer to fundamen-
tal (TEM00), vertical (TEM01) and horizontal (TEM10)
transverse modes. Pump losses are described by γp while
a common decay rate γ represents the losses for signal
and idler. The respective cavity detunings for pump,
signal and idler are ∆p, ∆s and ∆i. The astigmatic sym-
metry breaking is accounted for through the frequency
splitting parameters σp for pump and σi for idler. They
are calculated with the help of Eq.(24). The pump beam
amplitude transmitted through the input mirror is rep-
resented by the source term Ein. Since it is prepared in
a Laguerre-Gauss mode, the source terms appearing in
the dynamic equations for the amplitudes apv and aph
are π/2 out of phase. Finally, χ is the nonlinear coupling
constant.

The dynamic equations, as well as their steady state
solutions, are considerably simpliﬁed if we express time
in units of the cavity round trip time τ and deﬁne the
following normalized variables

bjk = χ Λ000 τ ajk , xin = χ Λ000 τ Ein ,
˜∆j = ∆j τ ,
˜γj = γj τ ,
Λk l m
Λ000

˜σj = ∆j τ ,

.

ηk l m =

(27)

As before, j = p, s, i for pump, signal and idler respec-
tively, and each of the subindices k, l and m may assume
the values 0, h or v. Cavity losses are around 29% at

532nm and 1% at 1064nm which gives ˜γp = 145 mrad
and ˜γ = 5 mrad .
In the absence of astigmatism and
walk-oﬀ the relevant normalized overlap integrals are
ηv v 0 = ηh h 0 = ηv 0 v = ηh 0 h = 0.71 approximately.
When the walk-oﬀ eﬀect is considered, the overlap in-
tegrals are averaged over the crystal volume. More-
over, the astigmatism is included through the appropri-
ate correction of the mode functions. Taking into ac-
count the experimental values for the walk-oﬀ and astig-
matism parameters we ﬁnd ηv v 0 = 0.70 , ηh h 0 = 0.60
0.71 . So, a signiﬁcant change is
and ηv 0 v ≈
obtained only for ηh h 0.

ηh 0 h ≈

It is instructive to consider the steady state solution
of Eqs.(26) in the simpliﬁed condition ∆s = ∆i = σp =
σi = 0 and ηv0v = ηh0h = η which correspond to neglect-
In this case the orbital

angular momentum is perfectly transferred to the idler
beam which will also oscillate in a Laguerre-Gauss mode
with the same topological charge of the pump beam.

As we shall see, a diﬀerent threshold condition is obtained

The analytical solution for the steady state includ-
ing all parameters is cumbersome but Eqs.(28) give us
a good estimate for the orders of magnitude.
In fact,
as we discussed in section IV, the expected value for the
pump and idler splitting parameters are ideed very small,
˜σp = 4 mrad and ˜σi = 3 mrad (the splitting parameter is
half the astigmatic phase shift calculated from Eq.(24)).
However, this small splitting may be responsible for par-
tial transfer of the orbital angular momentum from the
pump to the idler mode. In order to illustrate this, we
numerically integrated the dynamic equations (26) with a
fourth order Runge-Kutta method until the steady state
was reached. In Fig.7 this time evolution is shown to-
gether with the value I0 given by Eq.(28). In the inset,
we show the expected image for signal (S) and idler (I)
obtained with the numerical steady state results. A good
qualitative agreement is obtained with the experimental
results corresponding to peaks 1, 2 and 4 of Fig.3.

The transverse mode splitting now appears in the dy-
namic equation for the signal beam and is represented
by the parameter σs. However, the splitting parameter
is expected to be of the order of 41 mrad. Since cavity
losses in the infrared are of the order of 1%, the corre-
sponding normalized decay rate is ˜γ = 5 mrad, so that
σs >> ˜γ. Under such conditions it is impossible for
the OPO to support the simultaneous operation of the
h and v modes necessary to compose a Laguerre-Gauss
mode. Therefore, the orbital angular momentum cannot
be transferred to the down-converted beams. The cavity
tuning will select the signal Hermite-Gauss mode whose
resonance frequency is closer to the idler resonance. For
example, for ∆s =
σs the cavity frequency falls far
away from the h signal resonance while the v mode gets
0 and the steady state
on resonance. In this case ash ≈
solution of Eqs.(31) can be analytically obtained. Notice
that the normalized overlap integral ηh h 0 will not play
any role in this case. We therefore set η = ηv v 0 and use

The h component of the pump beam does not couple
do the down-converted modes so that its steady state
solution corresponds just to an empty cavity. On the
other hand, the v component of the signal beam, as well
as the fundamental idler mode, presents a steady state
intensity lower than the one found in Eqs.(28) for the
same pump level xin. This corresponds to the situation
found in peak 3 of Fig.3, which is clearly lower than the
other infrared peaks. Again, the oscillation threshold is

It is twice the threshold value for the case where the or-

The numerical evolution of Eqs.(31) using a fourth
order Runge-Kutta method was performed without the
simplfying assumptions. These results are presented in
Fig.8, where the inset shows the expected images for sig-
nal and idler. The walk oﬀ and astigmatic eﬀects were
fully considered and a good agreement with the exper-
imental result was obtained. The theoretical model de-
veloped here will be useful for future investigation of the
transverse mode dynamics in the quantum domain. In-
teresting perspectives can be envisaged if the OPO oper-
ation is subject to an injected signal. Recent studies on
degenerate [36] and nondegenerate [37] parametric pro-
cesses with injected signal has considered interesting is-
sues like the preparation of quantum correlated states
(Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states) as well as the study of
critical behaviours of the OPO operation [38].

The horizontal solid line shows the analytical value I ′

Our results open interesting perspectives related to the
quantum regime of the OPO operation. The experimen-
tal setup can be used to generate twin beams (intensity
diﬀerence squeezing) and the production of the optical
vortices under squeezed operation can lead to interesting
quantum patterns in the down-converted beams. More-
over, the quantum dynamics of the type II operation
may lead to entanglement between the polarization and
the spatial degrees of freedom [39]. We are theoretically
investigating this possibility and an experiment will be
setup in the near future.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have shown that the transfer of orbital angular
momentum in intracavity parametric down-conversion is
strongly subjected to cavity and anisotropy eﬀects. This
can be achieved if pump, signal and idler are in a set
of modes where the Hermite-Gauss components of the
Laguerre-Gauss mode are degenerate inside the cavity.
While that can be easily achieved for the idler beam, the
signal beam cannot fullﬁll this condition unless cavity
losses are large. The signal beam can still oscillate in a
higher order transverse mode, but in this case, the thresh-
old power increases, and the orbital angular momentum
is not transferred to the outcoming beams.

Abstract:
Second-harmonic and sum-frequency mixing phenomena
associated with 3D-localized photonic modes are studied in InP-based
planar photonic crystal microcavities excited by short-pulse radiation near
1550 nm. Three-missing-hole microcavities that support two closely-spaced
modes exhibit rich second-order scattering spectra that reﬂect intra- and
inter-mode mixing via the bulk InP c (2) during ring-down after excitation by
the broadband, resonant pulse. Simultaneous excitation with a non-resonant
source results in tunable second-order radiation from the microcavity.

Introduction

Microfabricated structures in semiconductor thin ﬁlms offer the opportunity to tightly conﬁne
light in nonlinear, transparent media [1, 2, 3, 4]. Various micro-disk and micro-toroid struc-
tures have been fabricated in semiconductor membranes to act as ultrasmall optical cavities
that support discrete microcavity modes with very high quality (Q) factors in excess of 108 [5].
These exhibit optical bistability and other nonlinear responses at exceedingly low optical pow-
ers when coupled efﬁciently to single mode waveguides [6, 7]. Engineered defect states within
planar photonic crystals (PPCs) offer an alternative to micro-disk/toroid-based cavities: cur-
rently they have not been produced with as high Q values, but their mode volumes (Vm) are
smaller, so that the ratio of their Q values to their mode volumes are comparable, or even larger.
Q/V or Q/√Vm are ﬁgures of merit for cavity-based quantum electrodynamic (cavity QED)
phenomena, which provides yet another motivation for developing ultrasmall nonlinear struc-
tures [8, 9]. Enhanced second-harmonic generation (SHG) has been observed in 1D photonic
crystal microcavities with dielectric [10] and mesoporous silicon Bragg mirrors [11]. Previ-
ous work studying SHG in PPC slabs showed that when one or both of the fundamental and
second-harmonic beams are mode-matched to leaky modes of the structure, there is a signiﬁ-
cant resonant enhancement of the radiated second harmonic [12, 13]. This effect was shown to
be due to the local ﬁeld enhancements associated with the incoming and outgoing resonances.
In this letter, we report on the second-order response of the 3D-localized states of a PPC mi-
crocavity in a sub-wavelength thick semiconductor slab that is locally excited by a diffraction-
limited beam incident perpendicular to the slab. The mode energies, and hence the second-
order radiation energies, can be controlled by tailoring the photonic crystal defect lattice that
deﬁnes the microcavity [14].

3. Results

The linear resonant scattering spectrum from a three-missing-hole (3h) cavity which supports
a single mode is shown in Figure 2(a). The non-resonant background, which has the shape of
the excitation spectrum, is radiated by polarization driven by the OPO source while it directly
interacts with the thin slab. The resonant feature is due to lingering polarization induced by the
electric ﬁeld scattered into the resonant mode of the cavity as it “rings down” [15]. When the
spectrometer is set to twice the frequency, the resulting SHG spectrum (b) closely mimics the
linear spectrum. The broad peak is also observed when the untextured InP slab is irradiated
by the same beam. This non-resonant second-order scattering corresponds to the second-order
interaction between the laser pulse and the InP slab. The sharp feature at exactly twice the mode
frequency corresponds to the second-order polarization induced by the mode, as it rings down,
via the c (2) of the InP slab.

inter-mode interactions of the ﬁelds, which are resonantly scattered into the microcavity modes
from the femtosecond (fs) pulses, as the energy in the cavity decays due to out-of-plane (linear)
scattering. The sum-frequency generation (SFG) associated with the inter-mode interaction pro-
vides a weak probe of the mode occupation(s). This signal is only non-zero when two modes are
excited in the microcavity, and it may therefore be applicable in weak quantum measurement
schemes [16, 17].

The electric ﬁelds trapped in the microcavity modes can also be used to generate second-
order radiation at different frequencies via sum-frequency mixing with a separate ﬁeld incident
on the structure. This is illustrated in Figure 4, where a series of four second-order spectra from
the same microcavity as in Fig. 3 are shown when simultaneously excited by short, resonant
pulses (as in Fig. 3), and longer, picosecond (ps) pulses tuned far off resonance with the mi-
crocavity modes. This two-colour source is readily available from the unﬁltered “signal” beam
output of the OPO when it is tuned near the degeneracy point (where both signal and idler fre-
quencies are close to half the pump frequency). An example of this unﬁltered spectrum when

OPO signal pulses are accompanied by relatively long (a few ps) OPO idler pulses at a cen-
tre frequency roughly equal to the difference between the pump and signal frequencies. The
centre frequency of these ps pulses converges with the signal beam frequency at half the pump
frequency as the OPO is tuned.

The second-order spectra show three principal groups of features that are marked by lines
A, B, and C to guide the eye. Feature A and the broad background in group C (the ﬁt of
which is plotted separately as a dashed red line), are the second-harmonics of the ps and fs
features, respectively, in the excitation spectra. These features, which shift at the same rate
as the corresponding features in the excitation spectra, are due to non-resonant second-order
scattering, as observed in Fig. 2.

pulse; a broad resonant laser pulse; and a two-mode PPC microcavity. The blue curves
(a)-(d) show the second-order response, plotted at half the energy, as the OPO is tuned to
higher energy. In each spectrum, the amplitude of the low energy region has been multi-
plied by 10 for clarity. The solid red curve (b) shows the laser spectrum scattered from an
untextured part of the InP slab. The non-resonant second-order laser background is shown
schematically by the dashed red curves. The features A, B, and C are discussed in detail in
the text.

B that shift at half the rate of the excitation beam(s), are speciﬁc to the microcavity modes.
They all reﬂect second-order processes that involve the ﬁelds “trapped” in at least one of the
modes, as they ring down. The three (ﬁxed) peaks in group C correspond to the mode SHG
and SFG features, as in Figure 3. The features in group B are then easily understood to result
from the second-order radiation of the two ﬁeld distributions trapped in the microcavity modes
respectively interacting with the ps pulses that are constantly irradiating the cavity during the
ring-down. To understand the difference in the shift rate between features A and B, consider
a ps pulse at w A interacting with a microcavity mode at w C. When the ps pulse is tuned from

Experimentally, the polarization of the non-resonant second-order radiation associated with
the laser background in spectra such as shown in Fig. 2 is virtually unchanged from spectra
obtained from an untextured “bulk” part of the InP slab. This suggests that the bulk InP second-
order tensor is sufﬁcient to describe the nonlinear polarization generated in the material by
the OPO pulses. However, the relationship between the electromagnetic ﬁeld polarizations of

the excitation source and the second-order ﬁelds radiated from the resonant modes is quite
different, and more complex, in this microcavity geometry than in more familiar bulk or uniform
waveguide structures. The second-order polarizations associated with the resonant modes have
complex multipole-like distributions, and scattering from the surrounding lattice of air-holes
plays an important role in determining the properties of the far-ﬁeld radiation that is generated.
An analysis of the polarization properties of the second-order radiation will be discussed in a
forthcoming publication.

4. Summary

In summary, we have demonstrated second-order intra- and inter-mode nonlinear mixing of
3D-localized modes in a planar photonic crystal defect microcavity. When the microcavity
supports a single mode, the second-order spectrum mimics the linear spectrum, showing both
non-resonant and resonant features. When the microcavity supports two modes, an additional
feature is revealed in the second-order spectrum, due to the nonlinear mixing of both resonant
modes. The energy stored in the microcavity modes can be used in conjuction with a separate,
nonresonant beam, to generate tunable sum frequency radiation over a broad range of frequen-
cies.

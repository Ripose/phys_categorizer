Abstract

The T-matrix method is widely used for the calculation of scattering by particles of sizes on the
order of the illuminating wavelength. Although the extended boundary condition method (EBCM) is
the most commonly used technique for calculating the T-matrix, a variety of methods can be used.

We consider some general principles of calculating T-matrices, and apply the point-matching
method to calculate the T-matrix for particles devoid of symmetry. This method avoids the time-
consuming surface integrals required by the EBCM.

1 The T-matrix method

The T-matrix method in wave scattering involves writing the relationship between the wave incident
upon a scatterer, expanded in terms of orthogonal eigenfunctions,

where an are the expansion coefﬁcients for the incident wave, and the scattered wave, also expanded in
terms of orthogonal eigenfunctions,

where pk are the expansion coefﬁcients for the scattered wave, is written as a simple matrix equation

or, in more concise notation,

where Tkn are the elements of the T-matrix. The T-matrix method can be used for scalar waves or vector
waves in a variety of geometries, with the only restrictions being that the geometry of the problem

permits expansion of the waves as discrete series in terms of orthogonal eigenfunctions, that the response
of the scatterer to the incident wave is linear, and that the expansion series for the waves can be truncated
at a ﬁnite number of terms. In general, one calculates the T-matrix, although it is conceivable that it might
be measured experimentally.

The T-matrix depends only on the particle—its composition, size, shape, and orientation—and is
independent of the incident ﬁeld. This means that for any particular particle, the T-matrix only needs to
be calculated once, and can then be used for repeated calculations. This is a signiﬁcant advantage over
many other methods of calculating scattering where the entire calculation needs to be repeated [1]. Some
cases provide even more efﬁciency: if the waves are expanded in spherical functions, the averaging of
scattering over various orientations of the particle compared to the direction of the incident wave can be
performed analytically [2].

In the spherical geometry of elastic light scattering by a particle contained entirely within some ra-
dius r0, the eigenfunction expansions of the ﬁelds are made in terms of vector spherical wavefunctions
(VSWFs) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]:

interest, it is useful to deﬁne the singularity-free regular vector spherical wavefunctions:

The two sets of expansion coefﬁcients for the incident/incoming ﬁeld are related, since a

nm. However, the scattered/outgoing ﬁeld expansion coefﬁcients will differ, as will the
T-matrix. Using the regular expansion, the T-matrix in the absence of a scatterer is a zero matrix, while
using the incoming ﬁeld expansion, the no-scatterer T-matrix is the identity matrix. The two expan-
sions are essentially the same—the only difference is that the incident wave in the incident/scattered
wave expansion includes part of the outgoing wave. T-matrices for the two expansions only differ by
the identity matrix, so T(in/out) = 2T(inc/scat) + I. The incident/scattered formulation is much more
commonly used; the incoming/outgoing formulation gives simpler results for the transport of momen-
tum and angular momentum (that is, optical force and torque) by the ﬁeld. It should be note that for
plane wave illumination, for which the VSWF expansion is non-terminating, the incident/scattered for-
mulation gives a scattered wave expansion that converges over all space, while the incoming/outgoing
expansion, strictly used, would give an non-terminating, non-convergent outgoing ﬁeld expansion. For
focussed beam illumination with a ﬁnite VSWF expansion, the incoming/outgoing expansion directly
gives the total outgoing ﬁeld that would be experimentally measured. Since conversion from one formu-
lation to the other is simple, either can be readily used for calculation of ﬁelds, forces, scattering matrices,
or for orientation averaging.

In practice, the ﬁeld expansions and the T-matrix are terminated at some n = Nmax. For the case of
kr0 is usually adequate, but Nmax = kr0 + 3 3√kr0
a scatterer that is contained within a radius r0, Nmax ≈
is advisable if higher accuracy is needed [7]. Although we assume in this paper (as is usually the case)
that the incident and scattered wave expansions are terminated at the same Nmax (giving a square T-
matrix), this is not necessary.
It should be noted that convergence of the expansion of the incident
ﬁeld is not a necessary condition for the T-matrix method to be useful—indeed, for the most common
application, scattering of an incident plane wave, the incident ﬁeld expansion does not converge over
all space. However, it does converge within the radius r0—which is the part of the ﬁeld that can affect
the scattering particle—and therefore, the ﬁeld expansions and the T-matrix can be truncated at a ﬁnite
Nmax.

For the case of plane wave scattering, the plane wave expansion formula is useful:

(12)

The main case of interest for non-plane wave incident illumination is that of focussed beams. A
variety of methods can be used, such as plane wave expansion [8], the localised approximation [9, 10, 11,
12], or the point-matching method [13].

The only remaining requirement is that the T-matrix be calculated. This requires essentially a com-
plete calculation of the scattering properties of the scatterer. This is almost universally done using the ex-
tended boundary condition method (EBCM), originally developed by Waterman [3], which is so strongly
linked with the T-matrix method that the terms “EBCM” and “T-matrix method” are often used inter-
changeably. In the next section, we consider some general principles involved in the calculation of the T-
matrix, and show that an alternative method—column-by-column calculation using the point-matching
method (PMM)—is computationally feasible and simply implemented for homogeneous isotropic parti-
cles devoid of symmetry.

Lastly, before we continue to consider calculation of T-matrices in more detail, we can note that while
the incident and scattered ﬁelds are usually expanded in terms of VSWFs, other sets of eigenfunctions,
such as cylindrical wavefunctions (for scatterers of inﬁnite length in one dimension), or a Floquet ex-
pansion (planar periodic scatterers), are more appropriate for other geometries. There is no requirement
that the modes into which the incident and scattered ﬁelds are expanded be the same, or even similar. In
all of these cases, the T-matrix method remains applicable.

If the ﬁeld expansions and T-matrix are truncated at some Nmax, there are NT = 2Nmax(Nmax + 2)
NT. Since
expansion coefﬁcients for each of the incident and scattered ﬁelds, and the T-matrix is NT ×

obtain an estimate of the scaling of computational time for different methods of calculation.

0, and the number of elements in the T-matrix is proportional to r4

2.1 The extended boundary condition method

In principle, any method of calculating scattering by the particle can be used to calculate the T-matrix.
However, the method of choice is almost universally the EBCM [1, 2, 3, 4]. In the EBCM, the internal
ﬁeld within the particle is expanded in terms of regular VSWFs. Therefore, the method is restricted to
homogeneous and isotropic particles. Rather than considering the coupling of the incident and scat-
tered ﬁelds directly, the coupling between the incident and internal (the RgQ matrix), and scattered and
1). The
internal ﬁelds (the Q matrix) is calculated, and the T-matrix found from these (T =
RgQ and Q matrices are the same size as the T-matrix, with O(N4
max) elements. The elements of these
matrices are found by integrating over the surface of the scatterer, an operation requiring O(N2
max) time
per element, so the calculation of the RgQ and Q matrices is expected to require O(N6
max) computational
time. The actual calculation of the T-matrix, if direct inversion is na¨ıvely used, takes O(N6
max) time. In
practice, the calculation of the RgQ and Q matrices dominates the computational time [14].

RgQQ−

−

and N(1)
n′m′

From this, it can be seen that the EBCM can be expected to be very slow for large particles. However,
most applications of the EBCM have been for the special case of scattering particles rotationally symmet-
ric about the z axis. In this case, scattered modes M(1)
only couple to incident modes RgMnm
n′m′
and RgNnm if m′ = m, greatly reducing the number of matrix elements that need to be calculated, and
the surface integral over the particle surface reduces to a one-dimensional integral over θ, since the az-
imuthal integration over φ can be simply done analytically [4]. This results in a great improvement in
performance, and, in terms of computational time, EBCM is clearly the method of choice for axisym-
metric particles. Numerical problems do occur when the scatterer is highly non-spherical. The discrete
sources method is designed to overcome these problems [15]. For the even more symmetric case of a
spherical scatterer, the scattered and incident modes only couple if n′ = n and m′ = m, the T-matrix
becomes diagonal, and all of the integrals can be performed analytically, and Mie’s solution to scattering
by a sphere [16] is simply obtained.

In a similar manner, scatterers with point-group rotational symmetry allow signiﬁcant improvement

of the computational time required through exploitation of the symmetry [14, 17, 18].

Methods have also been developed to calculate T-matrices for clusters of particles and for layered

particles [1].

The efﬁciency of the EBCM for the calculation of the T-matrix is such that alternative methods
need only be considered if the EBCM is inapplicable (such as when the particle in inhomogeneous or
anisotropic), numerical difﬁculties are encountered using the EBCM (such as for extremely non-spherical
particles), or if the scattering particle has no symmetries that can be used to optimise the computation of
the T-matrix.

2.2 Methods other than the EBCM

Methods other than the EBCM can be used to calculate the T-matrix. In general, one would calculate the
scattered ﬁeld, given a particular incident ﬁeld. The most direct way in which to use this to produce a
T-matrix is to solve the scattering problem when the incident ﬁeld is equal to a single spherical mode—
that is, a single VSWF such as Einc(r) = RgM11(kr), Einc(r) = RgN11(kr), Einc(r) = RgM21(kr), etc,
and repeat this for all VSWFs that need to be considered (up to n = Nmax). The expansion coefﬁcients

4

for the scattered ﬁeld can be found in each case, if necessary, by using the orthogonal eigenfunction
transform (the generalised Fourier transform), and each scattering calculation gives a single column of
the T-matrix.

Therefore, the calculation of a T-matrix requires that 2Nmax(Nmax + 2) separate scattering problems
are solved. The provides a criterion for deciding whether it is desirable to calculate a T-matrix: if more
than 2Nmax(Nmax + 2) scattering calculations will be performed, then it is more efﬁcient to calculate
the T-matrix and use this for the repeated calculations than it is to use the original scattering method
repeatedly. Repeated calculations are expected if orientation averaging is to be carried out, or if inho-
mogeneous illumination is to be considered, such as, for example, scattering by focussed beams, where
there are generally 6 degrees of freedom, namely the three-dimensional position of the scatterer within
the beam, and the three-dimensional orientation of the scatterer. Even if only a modest number of points
are considered along each degree of freedom, the total number of scattering calculations required rapidly
becomes very large, and even if the T-matrix takes many hours to calculate, the total time saved by doing
so can make an otherwise computationally infeasible problem tractable.

Volume methods are of interest, since they can readily be used for inhomogeneous or anisotropic
particles. The two most likely candidates are the ﬁnite-difference time-domain method (FDTD) [1, 19]
and the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). In FDTD, the Maxwell equations are discretised in space
and time, and, beginning from a known initial state, the electric and magnetic ﬁelds at each spatial grid
point are calculated for successive steps in time. The number of grid points required is O(N3
max) for
three-dimensional scattering, and O(Nmax) time steps required, so FDTD solutions scale as O(N4
max).
Therefore, calculation of the T-matrix using FDTD should scale as O(N6
max), which is the same scaling
as the EBCM. However, the grid required must be closely spaced compared to the wavelength, and
the space outside the scatterer must also be discretised, making FDTD substantially slower than EBCM,
especially for smaller particles. However, FDTD is an extremely general technique, and has potential as
a method for the calculation of T-matrices.

We should add that there is an additional consideration that makes FDTD potentially attractive as a
method for calculating the T-matrix: FDTD does not assume that the incident wave is monochromatic.
Consider the case when the illumination is a brief pulse with a Gaussian envelope. The frequency spec-
trum of the incident wave is Gaussian, and the scattering of a range of frequencies can be found by taking
the Fourier transform of the scattered ﬁeld [20]. Even if we are not interested in other than monochro-
matic illumination, we will frequently be interested in scattering by size distributions of particles. Since
varying the frequency for a particular particle is equivalent to varying the size of the particle for a ﬁxed
incident frequency, the T-matrices for a range of particle sizes can be calculated simultaneously.

The other major volume method for computational scattering, the discrete dipole approximation
(DDA), also known as the coupled-dipole method, has been recently applied to the calculation of the T-
matrix by Mackowski [21], who obtained good results, with reasonable computational efﬁciency using
a moment method to solve the DDA system of equations. DDA lacks the main disadvantages of FDTD,
namely the need to discretise space outside the particle, and the need to implement suitable boundary
conditions to prevent non-physical reﬂections from the boundary of the computational domain. Mack-
owski’s method scales as O(N7
max) for large Nmax. There is no need to discuss his method in detail here,
and the interested reader is referred to his recent description of the method [21].

Finally, we consider the point-matching method. Like the T-matrix method and the EBCM, the point-
matching method involves expansion of ﬁelds in terms of VSWFs. In the point-matching method, the
internal ﬁeld within the scatterer and the scattered ﬁeld are expanded as series of VSWFs, and the inci-
dent, internal, and scattered ﬁelds are matched at points on the particle surface, using the usual bound-
ary condition of continuity of tangential components of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. This gives a
system of equations from which the unknown expansion coefﬁcients of the internal and scattered ﬁelds
can be found. Typically, enough points are used for matching the ﬁelds so as to give an overdetermined
system of equations, which is then solved in a least-squares sense. Solving the system of O(N2
max) un-
knowns using direct matrix inversion can be expected to be an O(N6
max) problem, with the result that the

max) for our implementation.

max). In practice, faster methods can be used, and our results indicate a

The point-matching method is an attractive candidate since a T-matrix implementation will generally
include routines to calculate VSWFs, making the implementation of a point-matching T-matrix calculator
simple. The only further requirement is a routine for solving overdetermined linear systems. Since the
scattered ﬁeld is calculated in terms of VSWFs, the conversion of the results of a single PMM calculation
to a T-matrix column is trivial.

Naturally, multiple expansion methods (the generalised multipole technique, or the multiple multi-
pole method) can be used. Since multipole methods exist for anisotropic media [22], the method can be
used for anisotropic scatterers.

Our implementation of the point-matching method, and its performance, is discussed in the next

section.

3 Point-matching method

Our implementation of the PMM T-matrix calculation uses an incoming/outgoing ﬁeld expansion (equa-
tions (10) and (11)), rather than the usual incident/scattered wave expansion (equations (9) and (11)), and
the internal ﬁeld is expanded in terms of regular VSWFs:

We use this particular expansion since we are interested in calculating optical forces and torques within

We considered a single scatterer, centred on the origin, contained entirely within a radius r0, and with

a surface speciﬁed by a function of angle:

There are 4Nmax(Nmax + 2) unknown variables—the expansion coefﬁcients cnm, dnm, pnm, and qnm.
Since the ﬁelds are vector ﬁelds, each point gives multiple equations—four independent equations per
point. We generate a grid of 2Nmax(Nmax + 2) points with equal angular spacings in each of the θ and
φ directions, giving 8Nmax(Nmax + 2) independent equations. Equal angle spaced points are used for
simplicity, although points uniformly distributed about a sphere would be better [25].

The values of the VSWFs at these points on the particle surface are calculated, and used in the

column-by-column calculation of the T-matrix.

The computation time (which is independent of the particle shape, depending only on the containing
radius r0) is shown in table 1. The calculations were carried out in MATLAB [26] on a 1.5 GHz PC.
The times taken are reasonable in comparison to computation times for EBCM for particles with no
symmetry [14].

Results of a sample calculation are shown in ﬁgure 2, where the diagonal scattering matrix elements
are shown, calculated using the PMM T-matrix. The scattering matrix elements S11 and S22 are shown
for scattering in two different planes; the effect of non-axisymmetry is evident.

The accuracy and validity of the PMM-calculated T-matrix will be essentially the same as the ac-
curacy and validity of the point-matching algorithm used in the calculation. Thus, a detailed analysis
of our simple proof-of-principle implementation serves little purpose. It is obviously useful to use the
best, sufﬁciently fast, point-matching code available. In view of the mathematical similarity between the
T-matrix method and the point-matching method, it should be a simple task to adapt any PMM code to
the task of generating T-matrix columns.

4 Conclusions

The point-matching method is suitable for the calculation of the T-matrix for particles with no symmetry,
provided that the particles are not too large. The method has the advantage of being extremely simple to
implement within a general T-matrix package, since most of the required routines will be shared with the
existing T-matrix code. This results from the mathematical formalisms of the T-matrix method and the
point-matching method being essentially the same. Any point-matching algorithm can be used, with

multiple expansion origins, automatic convergence checks, and so on. Since the PMM uses the same
ﬁeld expansions as the EBCM, the same numerical difﬁculties are to be expected for scatterers with large
aspect ratios; in such cases, multiple expansion origin algorithms will be necessary. The accuracy of the
PMM T-matrix will be the same as the PMM which is used to calculate it. Naturally, the usual conditions
of applicability of the PMM, such as the validity of the Rayleigh hypothesis, need to be considered.

The PMM explicitly depends on the Rayleigh hypothesis—the assumption that the ﬁelds can be rep-
resented by the expansions (13)—(15) over all space rather than just outside and inside spherical surfaces
circumscribing and inscribing the surface of the scatterer. The validity of this assumption for arbitrary
scatterers is unknown. However, the use of an overdetermined system of equation may well extend the
method somewhat beyond the strict range of applicability of the Rayleigh hypothesis by providing a
least squares approximation of the ﬁelds between the circumscribing and inscribing surfaces where the
VSWF expansions might be non-convergent. One advantage of relying on the Rayleigh hypothesis is
that the ﬁelds are given everywhere, including the ﬁelds internal to the scatterer (a T(int)-matrix can be
used to relate the internal and incident ﬁelds). This applies generally to methods that make use of the
Rayleigh hypothesis, such as the generalised separation of variables method [27]. In contrast to this, the
EBCM, which avoids the Rayleigh hypothesis, gives the tangential surface ﬁelds on the surface of the
scatterer, rather than the internal ﬁelds.

The point-matching method lacks the generality of DDA and FDTD. In this respect, the recent dis-

crete dipole moment method T-matrix calculations by Mackowski [21] are particularly promising.

Lastly, we note again that FDTD may prove to be a useful method for T-matrix calculation since it

can be used to calculate T-matrices simultaneously for a range of particle sizes.

Scattering angle (degrees)

Figure 2: (a) S11 and (b) S22 scattering matrix elements for an ellipsoidal particle with axes of length
a = 1λ, b = 0.2λ, and c = 0.5λ, and relative refractive index m = 1.5. The incident illumination is
directed along the c axis of the ellipsoid. The solid line shows scattering in the ac plane (containing
the largest area cross-section of the ellipsoid), and the dotted line shows scattering in the bc plane (the
smallest cross-sectional area).

We review and extend the analogies between Gaussian pulse propagation and Gaussian beam
diﬀraction. In addition to the well-known parallels between pulse dispersion in optical ﬁber and
CW beam diﬀraction in free space, we review temporal lenses as a way to describe nonlinearities
in the propagation equations, and then introduce further concepts that permit the description of
pulse evolution in more complicated systems. These include the temporal equivalent of a spherical
dielectric interface, which is used by way of example to derive design parameters used in a recent
dispersion-mapped soliton transmission experiment. Our formalism oﬀers a quick, concise and
powerful approach to analyzing a variety of linear and nonlinear pulse propagation phenomena in
optical ﬁbers.

This paper introduces an ab-initio study of pulse prop-
agation phenomena analogous to spatial CW diﬀraction
behavior. We address both linear dispersive evolution
as well the self-phase modulation eﬀects of the nonlin-
ear index of refraction [1]. The latter is responsible for
much of the current interest in nonlinear optical com-
munications, since pulse shapes such as solitons and
dispersion-managed solitons display much more attrac-
tive transmission properties than linear transmission for-
mats (e.g. NRZ) [2].

Such nonlinear pulses are usually self-consistent eigen-
solutions of a wave equation, which is the primary reason
for their robustness to uncompensated spectral broaden-
ing and resultant dissipation into the continuum. The
conventional hyperbolic secant soliton is an exact solu-
tion of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation [3], and prop-
agates indeﬁnitely in a lossless medium without losing
its shape. Lossless media can be realized in practice
quite eﬀectively by using lumped ampliﬁcation stages,
and erbium-doped ﬁber ampliﬁers oﬀer excellent charac-
teristics in this regard.

Breathers, sometimes called dispersion-managed soli-
tons [4, 5], are also self-consistent ‘eigen solutions’ of
the wave equation that propagate with periodic pulse
width, chirp etc. While not strictly unchanging in shape,
breathers evolve back to their initial conﬁguration, essen-
tially traversing a closed, non-degenerate orbit in phase
space [6]. Unlike pulse shapes designed for linear trans-
mission channels, these pulses do not require periodic
dispersion compensation along the transmission channel,
and so oﬀer an attractive alternative to the strong control
requirements of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger soliton.

Characterizing the solutions of the nonlinear wave
equation is often simplest via direct numerical simula-
tion, and this has been particularly true for dispersion

mapped solitons [7]. In order to understand, capture and
then predict and utilize the essential physics that guides
this behavior, a more conceptually accessible framework
is sometimes preferable, such as the variational approach
with a pulse shape Ansatz [8]. The pulse shape is de-
scribed as a dynamical system; we write the Hamilto-
nian based on the action principle and seek solutions to
the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion [9, 10]. This ap-
proach is not always applicable, however, especially when
the Ansatz is incapable of capturing some essential phys-
ical behavior. Also, it is somewhat more of an analytical
tool for probing the dynamics of systems that we already
know something about, or can predict at least partially,
and it may be convenient to have other approaches that
can oﬀer quick insight into constructive aspects of non-
linear propagation, so that diﬀerent geometries can be
analyzed and compared quickly and easily.

The parallels between dispersive pulse propagation in
optical ﬁbers and paraxial CW Gaussian beam diﬀraction
in free space have been identiﬁed for some time [11, 12,
13]. More recently, the analogies have been extended to
include temporal lenses as a way to translate the imaging
properties of spatial lenses into the temporal domain [14].
In this way, pulse correlation and convolution devices
may also be constructed [15]. Still more recently, it was
shown that temporal lenses can characterize nonlinear
eﬀects in the wave equation, leading, for example to the
formation of a class of steady-state repeating pulses [16].
We believe that this is perhaps the most potentially use-
ful of the space-time analogies: in this paper, we further
extend the use this formalism to describe still more pow-
erful applications such as Gaussian pulse propagation in
optical ﬁber systems, including dispersion mapped sys-
tems, including the eﬀects of the nonlinear index of re-
fraction.

We ﬁrst outline the basic physics that motivates this
discussion and sets the context for further development.

I. SPACE-TIME ANALOGY OF BEAM
DIFFRACTION AND PULSE PROPAGATION

A. CW Gaussian beam diﬀraction

The Fresnel-Kirchoﬀ diﬀraction integral

is a well-
founded approach to electromagnetic propagation prob-
lems, and several textbooks cover the topic from a variety
of approaches [17, 18, 19]. We will brieﬂy review only as
much as necessary to establish our argument, limiting
our argument to diﬀraction in 1+1 (x,z) dimensions.

An electromagnetic ﬁeld of radian frequency ω and

scalar complex amplitude u(x, z) can be represented

E(x, z, t) = u(x, z) exp(iωt)

where u(x) obeys the wave equation,

2u + k2u = 0,

We consider optical beams whose plane wave compo-

approximation), so that we can expand the square root
in (3) in a Taylor series and keep the ﬁrst two terms,

The propagation of continuous-wave (CW) Gaussian
beams in free space and rotationally-symmetric quadratic

(cid:21)(cid:27)

In the above deﬁnition, R(z) describes the radius of cur-
vature of the beam, and w(z) the beam spot size.

The usefulness of the q-parameter lies in the bilinear
transformation (ABCD law) that characterizes how this
parameter evolves with propagation. For an optical sys-
tem described by a real (or complex) ABCD matrix, the
output q parameter is given by

qo =

Aqi + B
Cqi + D

.

(8)

Separating the real and imaginary parts of qo enables
us to calculate the radius of curvature and spot size
of the Gaussian beam at the output of the optical sys-
tem. Many practically important optical systems and
their corresponding phenomena can be described by sim-
ple ABCD matrices, such as propagation in a uniform
medium, focusing via a thin lens, beam transformation
at a dielectric interface, propagation through a curved di-
electric interface and thick lens, propagation in a medium
with a quadratic index variation etc. [17, Table 2-1]

B. Gaussian pulse propagation

Consider a single mode in an optical ﬁber, usually the
lowest-order fundamental mode, excited at z = 0, and
with an assumed temporal envelope of the Gaussian form,

E(z = 0, t) = Re

exp(

αt2 + iω0t)

(cid:21)

As in the spatial case, we can be think of this as a su-
perposition of time-harmonic ﬁelds, each with frequency
(ω0 + Ω) and amplitude ˜u0(Ω)dΩ. These waves will expe-
rience a phase delay when propagating a distance z; we
multiply each frequency component by its propagation

The formal similarity between (5) and (16) is the prin-
cipal motivation for this analysis. We can write down
a set of space-time translation rules (see Table I) to ap-
ply results from spatial diﬀraction to temporal dispersion
and vice versa. One family of results that can be derived
from this space-time analogy correspond to spatial imag-
ing e.g. the 2-f and 4-f optical systems. These can be
applied to pulse compression or expansion experiments
etc [14].

But we will see in later sections that many linear and
nonlinear pulse propagation systems can be described by
cascading simple ABCD matrices, and this can result in
substantially simpler calculations and more direct phys-
ical understanding of the physical processes involved in
nonlinear pulse propagation. We will ﬁrst need to develop
some additional facility in characterizing optical systems
associated with the pulse propagation equations.

The spatial q-parameter has a temporal equivalent qt

Table I, deﬁned by

where τ (z) represents the pulse width (scaled in the T

The transmission medium comprises of two concatenated
sections of ﬁber with lengths z1 and z2 and with GVD
coeﬃcients β′′

linear eﬀects in this simple problem, and assume that the
medium is lossless. What are the pulse characteristics at
the output of the second medium i.e. what is the pulse
width at z = z1 + z2?

One way of solving this problem is by recourse to the
wave equation (16) solution by the Fourier transform
technique. We have,

Using the space-time translation rules, we ﬁnd that the
above expression contains a description of second and
fourth-order dispersion, not third-order dispersion.

This is obviously a general characteristic of the above
Taylor expansion; all odd-order dispersion terms have no
spatial paraxial diﬀraction equivalent in the ABCD ma-
trix content. Recall that the eﬀect of β′ is accounted for
β′z.
by transforming to a moving reference frame T = t
For completeness, we derive the translation rule for any

CW diﬀractive optics. A little algebra will show that the

Note that this corrects the statement in [14]:

The slowly varying envelope equations corre-
sponding to modulated plane waves in disper-
sive media have the same form as the parax-
ial equations describing the propagation of
monochromatic waves of ﬁnite spatial extent
(diﬀraction).

We append that this correspondence holds for all even
orders of dispersion, and of course, for β′ as well, by
transforming to a moving reference frame.

Our ABCD formalism would be of limited interest if
the only phenomena it could capture were that of disper-
sive propgation. But, as mentioned in an earlier section,
the development of the time-lens formalism lets us de-
scribe nonlinear mechanisms as well.

By analogy to spatial lenses which are characterized by
a lens factor exp(ikr2/2f ) which multiplies an incoming
optical beam, we deﬁne a temporal lens as a device that
multiplies the pulse envelope by a factor [14, 16]

A comparison of spatial and temporal lensing is shown
in Figure 1. In the spatial case, the lens compensates for
the spreading of the beam waist, and “ﬂips” the phase
fronts to convert a diverging beam into a converging one.
Similarly, a temporal lens reverses the sign of the chirp, so
that further propagation in a β′′ < 0 dispersive ﬁber will
compensate for the chirp (phase modulation) caused this
far. This is also an interesting and physically illuminating
approach to discussing the physics of the formation of
solitons [17, Chapter 19].

achieve temporal lensing by self-phase modulation during

Another method of obtaining time lensing is based on
the principle of electro-optic modulation [14]. An electro-
optic phase modulator driven by a sinusoidal bias voltage
of angular frequency ωm results in a phase modulation
that is approximately quadratic under either extremum
of the sinusoid. The phase shift can be written as

We have described our temporal lens by a section of
nonlinear ﬁber of β′′
0, analogous to a spatial thin lens,
which is assumed to have no thickness. Just as practical
lenses do have some thickness, practical ﬁbers have non-
zero β′′. For those situations in which this cannot be
ignored, or may even be utilized constructively, we derive
the corresponding equivalent of a spatial “thick lens”.

Our ﬁrst step is to characterize the temporal equivalent
of a curved dielectric interface: a spatial lens comprises
of two such interfaces separated by a length of material
of enhanced refractive index. At a planar dielectric in-
terface between two media of refractive indices n1 and
n2, a Gaussian beam undergoes a change in the radius of
curvature, but is unchanged in beam width,

We now have the tools we need to analyze a reasonably
complicated practical problem: designing the length of a
dispersion map so as to get self-consistent eigen-pulses
with periodic pulse width and chirp.

III. DISPERSION-MANAGED SOLITON
TRANSMISSION EXPERIMENT

It has been recently found that a stable, self-consistent
pulse solution exists in a dispersion-managed ﬁber trans-
mission system [5]. While these are not solitons in
the strict mathematical sense, they have been called
dispersion-managed solitons, or perhaps more appropri-
ately, breathers. They demonstrate periodic behaviour:
the pulse width and chirp of Gaussian breathers, for
instance, are periodic functions of the propagation dis-
tance. Breathers share a property in common with soli-
tons in that they can propagate indeﬁnitely without
losing shape; even though the pulse shape undergoes
changes within a disperion map period, the pulse does
not disperse away to inﬁnity, or tend to self-focus to a
point either of which invalidate the applicability of the
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation after a certain distance.
A dispersion-mapped (DM) soliton is closer to a Gaus-
sian shape than the hyperbolic secant of the nonlinear

7

Schr¨odinger equation [20], and it is interesting to ask
whether our analysis is capable of capturing the essen-
tial aspects of its evolution along a dispersion-mapped
transmission channel.

We consider, as our example, the paper by Mu et
al. [21] who have simulated DM soliton dynamics in a
recirculating ﬁber loop. Their dispersion map consists of
100 km of dispersion shifted ﬁber (SMF-LS) with nor-
mal dispersion D1 equal to -1.10 ps/nm-km at 1551 nm,
followed by an “approximately 7-km span” of standard
single-mode ﬁber (SMF-28) with an anomalous disper-
sion D2 equal to 16.6 ps/nm-km at 1551 nm. The re-
sults of the paper indicate that Gaussian shaped pulses
of pulse duration 5.67 ps and peak power 9 dBm were
used. We will derive the result that, for these parame-
ters and given the length of SMF-LS ﬁber, the length of
SMF-28 ﬁber that needs to be used is indeed “approx-
imately 7-km”. In other words, we will show that this
given dispersion map can support lowest-order chirped
Gaussian self-consistent solutions, i.e. breathers.

The dispersion map, shown schematically in Figure 2,
consists of three ﬁber segments: a length z1/2 equal to
50 km of SMF-LS ﬁber, followed by a length z2 of SMF-
28 ﬁber, whose numerical value is to be determined, and
then the remainder z1/2 of SMF-LS ﬁber. Each segment
of ﬁber has nonlinear characteristics, which we model via
a time lens situated, for simplicity at the individual mid-
points of the respective segments. Consequently, each
segment is described by the cascaded product of three
ABCD matrices, with two additional matrices represent-
ing the transitions between ﬁbers of diﬀerent β′′. For
simplicity, we will assume that the nonlinear properties
of the ﬁbers are identical.

The overall ABCD matrix for the system can be writ-

ten down quite easily,

The algebraic complexity of writing out the expressions

A (56), and it may be veriﬁed that AD

The q-parameter (we have dropped the t subscript in

Since D = A in our above analysis, we already see that
q is purely imaginary at z = 0 i.e. the pulse has zero chirp
at the midplanes, as we would expect a breather to have.
At this stage, we can substitute numerical values for
the various parameters (except z2, which is what we seek)
into the expressions for the A, B, C and D elements (56–
57) and solve (61) numerically for z2. While this is not
diﬃcult, and already yields a quick solution to the prob-
lem at hand, we can get further insight via a well-justiﬁed
simpliﬁcation as follows.

Our ABCD matrix formalism for pulse propagation ap-
plies to chirped Gaussian pulses. To analyze more com-
plicated shapes, we can expand the given pulse shape in a
basis of chirped Hermite-Gaussian functions, which form
a complete orthonormal basis [18, 20]. The Hermite-
Gaussian function (we consider only unchirped Gaussians
here for simplicity) of order n is deﬁned as the product
of the Hermite polynomial of order n with a Gaussian
function,

The numerical solution (of the quadratic equation) for
z2 is equal to 7.00 km which is indeed the value “approx-
imately 7 km” stated in the paper [21]. In spite of appar-
ent exact agreement, we should be careful to appreciate
that this analysis is a characterization of only the most
important processes in this experiment. Possible sources
for approximation include the fact that a DM soliton is
only approximately Gaussian, and that we have repre-
sented the combined dispersive and nonlinear properties
of the ﬁber segments by a single temporal lens. A better
approximation may be to include several temporal lenses
for each segment of ﬁber; this would make the algebraic
expressions in this paper quite cumbersome to write down
explicitly, but the numerical computation would not be
much more diﬃcult, since the matrices are only two-by-
two in size, and comprise of purely real elements. The
experimental conﬁguration of [21] also includes several
other elements which can aﬀect the pulse shape, such as
ﬁlters, ﬁber ampliﬁers and polarization controllers.

which can be seen to agree with (19).

A Hermite-Gaussian therefore maintains its shape dur-
ing propagation, but adds a chirp (which is the same for

all modes) and a scaling of the width according to (19).
Power conservation implies that the amplitude corre-
spondingly scales down. The only term that is dependent
on the order of the Hermite-Gaussian is a phase term;
higher-order modes have greater phase advances, since
their spectral content is higher. The important observa-
tion is that the orthogonality of the Hermite-Gaussian
expansion is preserved, and so this expansion may be
used to predict the pulse shape obtained by propagating
an input pulse. Our formalism remains valid as long as
the diﬀerential equation describing the propagation of a
particular order Hermite-Gaussian is of the form (15),
i.e. the slowly-varying envelope approximation is valid.
Therefore, we can expect that the lower-order expansions
are usually valid; the results of applying our analysis to
higher-order expansion terms generate the residual ﬁeld
corrections to the lower order results [22].

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a 2

2 ABCD matrix formalism
×
for describing pulse propagation in media described by
Maxwell’s equations, accounting for dispersion, nonlin-
ear and gain/loss mechanisms. The method is analo-
gous to techniques used in CW beam diﬀraction analy-
sis, and correspondingly similar phenomena can be pre-
dicted, such as chirp transformation, focusing, periodic
pulse width expansion and narrowing etc. The spatial q
parameter has a time equivalent qT in accordance with
the given space-time translation rules. The real and
−1
imaginary parts of q
T represent the chirp and the width
of the pulse as a function of propagation distance z.

The propagation of various input pulse shapes can be
described by expanding the given pulse in a basis of
Hermite-Gaussian functions; the ABCD formalism ap-
plies to each Gaussian wave function separately. Propa-
gation through a complicated system of optical elements

10

is simple to calculate in terms of ABCD matrices: the
resultant matrix is the cascaded product of the ABCD
matrices of each of the individual elements with the ap-
propriate ordering. The overall qT parameter is given by
a bilinear transformation in terms of the ABCD elements
of the overall product matrix, exactly analogous to the
spatial case.

We have formulated ABCD matrices for pulse propa-
gation in dispersive ﬁbers, and for temporal lenses which
can characterize self-phase modulation phenomena. A
spatial dielectric interface translates to an interface be-
tween ﬁber segments of dissimilar GVD coeﬃcient β′′.
The temporal equivalent of a curved dielectric interface
is useful for characterizing the transition between such
dissimilar β′′ ﬁbers with the added presence of ﬁber non-
linearities arising from the nonlinear index of refraction
n2. We have used these tools to characterize a reason-
ably complicated real-life system: calculation of the dis-
persion map for self-consistent stable propagation of a
dispersion-managed soliton.

We believe this method of analysis forms a useful
complement to conventional pulse propagation methods,
such as the split-step Fourier transform numerical proce-
dures [3] which are substantially more computationally
intensive. The ABCD approach is useful for clarifying
the important dispersive and nonlinear focusing eﬀects
in dispersion-mapped nonlinear ﬁber segments. Together
with the variational approach [8], based on modeling the
pulse as a dynamical system characterized by a Hamilto-
nian functional [9], the q-parameter oﬀers an insight into
pulse evolution from a theoretical standpoint.

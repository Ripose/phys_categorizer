On resolving the refractive index and the wave vector

Compiled February 9, 2014

The identiﬁcation of the refractive index and wave vector for general (possibly active) linear, isotropic,
homogeneous, and non-spatially dispersive media is discussed. Correct conditions for negative refraction
necessarily include the global properties of the permittivity and permeability functions ǫ = ǫ(ω) and µ = µ(ω).
On the other hand, a necessary and suﬃcient condition for left-handedness can be identiﬁed at a single
frequency (Re ǫ/|ǫ| + Re µ/|µ| < 0). At oblique incidence to semi-inﬁnite, active media it is explained that

the wave vector generally loses its usual interpretation for real frequencies.

After Pendry’s perfect lens proposal,1 metamateri-
als and negative refractive index materials have re-
ceived much attention. The performance of the Veselago–
Pendry lens is strongly limited by loss; thus it has been
argued that active media may be required to achieve
large resolution.2

While the identiﬁcation of the refractive index of pas-
sive media is relatively straightforward, in this Letter
I will point out that for general (possibly active) me-
dia, one must be careful. Indeed, any direct identiﬁca-
tion method from ǫ and µ at a single frequency, such as
the approaches in Refs. 3-5, are incorrect in general. The
global behavior of the functions ǫ = ǫ(ω) and µ = µ(ω)
must be taken into account to identify the refractive in-
dex at a single frequency.

On the other hand, it is possible to identify a single-
frequency condition on ǫ(ω) and µ(ω) such that the as-
sociated medium is left-handed (or right-handed). This
means that for active media, there is not necessarily any
connection between the sign of the refractive index and
the left-handedness/right-handedness.6–8

At oblique incidence, another subtle point arises. Let
the semi-inﬁnite medium be located in the region z > 0.
Even if the medium is weakly amplifying, it will become
clear that in general, the longitudinal wave vector com-
ponent kz is not well-deﬁned for real frequencies. In fact,
in some common cases kz necessarily loses its usual phys-
ical interpretation.

To see these properties, we start by deﬁning the refrac-
tive index n(ω) of linear, isotropic, and homogeneous me-
dia without spatial dispersion. An implicit time depen-
dence exp(−iωt) is assumed. First, recall that by causal-
ity, the medium polarization and magnetization cannot
precede the electric or magnetic ﬁelds. This means that
the functions ǫ(ω) and µ(ω) are analytic in the upper
half of the complex frequency plane.9 Moreover, ǫ(ω)
and µ(ω) tend to +1 as Re ω → ∞. When ǫ(ω)µ(ω)
has no odd-order zeros in the upper half-plane, n(ω) for
Im ω > 0 is deﬁned as the analytic branch of pǫ(ω)µ(ω)
that tends to +1 as Re ω → ∞. For real ω, n(ω) is de-
ﬁned as the limit of n(ω + iδ) as δ → 0+.

When ǫ(ω)µ(ω) has odd-order zeros in the upper half-
plane, pǫ(ω)µ(ω) clearly cannot be identiﬁed as an an-
alytic function there. In these cases, the refractive index
is only deﬁned above the zeros, i.e., for Im ω > γ, where
γ is a positive number.8 In fact, then the refractive index
cannot be attributed a unique, physical meaning for real
frequencies. These media show absolute instabilities in
the sense that any small excitation will lead to inﬁnite
(or saturated) ﬁelds as t → ∞ at a ﬁxed position. Note
that this type of instability is diﬀerent to the convective
instabilities in conventional gain media.

One may argue that both signs of the refractive in-
dex correspond to valid solutions to Maxwell’s equations.
However, any physical excitation starts at some time
t = 0. Thus, to see which of the two solutions that is
excited, one must use a causal source, such as a unit-
step modulated sinusoidal.10 The monochromatic solu-
tion is then found in the limit t → ∞. This calculation
may be performed numerically in the time-domain. Al-
ternatively, one can calculate the ﬁelds in the frequency
domain (or more precisely, Laplace transform domain)
as follows:8 Consider ﬁrst a ﬁnite slab of thickness d,
surrounded by vacuum. Then the ﬁeld at the far end of
the slab can trivially be speciﬁed, and the ﬁeld in the
slab is determined. By expanding this ﬁeld into a geo-
metric series, and retaining only the term that yields a
nonzero inverse Laplace transform for t < d/c, where c
is the vacuum light velocity, the resulting ﬁeld has not
felt the presence of the far end. Thus, by subsequently
taking the limit d → ∞ the solution in a semi-inﬁnite
medium has been obtained. This procedure yields a ﬁeld
of the form exp[iωn(ω)z/c], where n(ω) is given by the
deﬁnition above.

Note that the deﬁnition of n(ω) is consistent with rel-
ativistic causality.8, 10, 11 Any other deﬁnition of the re-
fractive index must be equivalent to that above to ensure
the ﬁeld dependence exp[iωn(ω)z/c] in a semi-inﬁnite
medium, for a causal plane-wave excitation at z = 0.

The term “left-handed medium”, as introduced by
Veselago,12 refers to the fact that for simultaneously neg-
ative ǫ(ω) and µ(ω), the electric ﬁeld, magnetic ﬁeld, and

1

the wave vector form a left-handed set of vectors. Since
ǫ(ω) and µ(ω) generally are complex, it is common to
rather adopt the following deﬁnition: A medium is said
to be left-handed at the frequency ω if the associated,
time-averaged Poynting vector and the phase velocity
point in opposite directions. If they point in the same
direction, the medium is right-handed.

Having established the deﬁnitions, we now turn to the
conditions for negative refraction. For simplicity the ω
dependence in the notations will be omitted. First we
treat the well-known case where the medium is passive,
i.e., Im ǫ and Im µ are positive for positive frequencies.
According to the deﬁnition of the refractive index, n →
+1 as Re ω → ∞ in the upper half-plane. Since ǫµ → +1
in this limit, n → +1 is achieved by letting

n = p|ǫ||µ| exp[i(arg ǫ + arg µ)/2],

(1)

where the complex arguments are restricted to the inter-
val (−π, π] (i.e., [0, π] for positive frequencies). It is well
known that for passive materials, ǫ and µ cannot take
any real value less than 1 in the upper half-plane.9 (In
particular, ǫµ is zero-free there.) Thus, with the above
restrictions on the complex arguments, the right-hand
side of Eq. (1) becomes analytic in the upper half-plane
and represents the correct n.

With the expression (1) it is now straightforward to
obtain the conditions for negative refraction: The real
part of the refractive index of a passive medium is neg-
ative if and only if

arg ǫ + arg µ > π.

(2)

Inequality (2) is equivalent to the conditions that ap-
peared in Refs. 13 and 14.

The condition for left-handedness is found by cal-
culating the time-averaged Poynting vector. Assuming
a plane wave of the form exp(iωnz/c), we easily ﬁnd
that the sign of the Poynting vector is given by that of
Re (n/µ). With the help of Eq. (1) (which implicitly as-
sumes signal front velocity in the +z-direction), we ﬁnd
that Re (n/µ) = p|ǫ|/|µ| cos[(arg ǫ − arg µ)/2] cannot be
negative. Physically this means that a causal excitation
of a wave with signal front velocity in the +z-direction
leads for a passive material necessarily to energy ﬂow in
the same direction. The result can also be rephrased as
the following: A passive material is left-handed if and
only if Re n < 0, i.e., if and only if condition (2) is ful-
ﬁlled.

For general (possibly active) media, the situation is
completely diﬀerent. We limit ourselves to media with
no absolute instabilities, i.e., media for which ǫµ has no
odd-order zeros in the upper half-plane. Then the re-
fractive index can be identiﬁed as an analytic function
in the upper half-plane. An analytic function is of course
continuous; thus the refractive index is given by

n = p|ǫ||µ| exp[i(ϕǫ + ϕµ)/2],

(3)

where ϕǫ +ϕµ is the complex argument of ǫµ, unwrapped
such that 2π discontinuities are removed, and such that

it tends to a multiple of 4π as Re ω → ∞. Strictly, for real
frequencies, Eq. (3) is evaluated in the limit Im ω → 0+.
However, usually ǫµ is continuous at real frequencies ex-
cept possibly at ω = 0. Then Eq. (3) can be used directly
for real frequencies, by unwrapping ϕǫ+ϕµ for ω > 0 and
ω < 0, and ensuring the limit ϕǫ + ϕµ → 0 for ω → ±∞.
Note that in these common cases n(ω) is continuous for
real ω > 0. Also note that the phase unwrapping pro-
cedure means that the sign of the refractive index at a
certain frequency is dependent on the global properties
of the function ǫ(ω)µ(ω).

While it is impossible to establish a criterion for neg-
ative refraction that only considers a single frequency,
one can identify a general condition for left-handedness.
Let ˜n = p|ǫ||µ| exp[i(arg ǫ + arg µ)/2], where the com-
plex arguments are restricted to the range (−π, π]. (˜n
is not necessarily equal to the physical refractive index
n. However, since ˜n = ±n we can still determine left-
handedness/right-handedness by comparing the signs of
Re ˜n and Re (˜n/µ).) If Re ˜n > 0, we ﬁnd that Re (˜n/µ) >
0 when | arg ǫ − arg µ| < π. If Re ˜n < 0, Re (˜n/µ) > 0
always. This means that the medium is right-handed
when | arg ǫ + arg µ| < π and | arg ǫ − arg µ| < π, and
left-handed otherwise. Noting that Re ǫ/|ǫ| + Re µ/|µ| =
cos arg ǫ + cos arg µ = 2 cos arg ǫ+arg µ
, this
can be rephrased as follows: A medium is left-handed if
and only if

cos arg ǫ−arg µ

Re ǫ/|ǫ| + Re µ/|µ| < 0.

(4)

The condition (4) appeared previously in Ref. 14; how-
ever note that the alternative condition in Ref. 14,
Re ǫ Im µ + Re µ Im ǫ < 0, and the condition in Ref. 13
only apply to passive media.

The subtle behavior of certain active media can be
illustrated by the following example: Let ǫp(ω), µp(ω),
and np(ω) be the electromagnetic parameters of a pas-
sive material. At a certain frequency ω1 we assume that
the medium is left-handed, with ǫp = µp = −1 + iα,
where 0 < α ≪ 1. Thus the refractive index at ω1
is np = −1 + iα. Now, consider an active material
with permittivity ǫ(ω) = ǫp(ω)µp(ω) and permeabil-
ity µ(ω) = 1. Since ǫ(ω) is analytic in the upper half-
plane, and has the correct asymptotic behavior, this ac-
tive medium is causal and realizable, at least in principle.
From the deﬁnition, we ﬁnd immediately the refractive
index n(ω) = np(ω). Thus, at ω1 the refractive index is
n = −1 + iα while ǫ ≈ 1 − 2iα and µ = 1. In other
words, at ω1, although the medium has permittivity and
permeability identical to that of conventional, positively
refracting gain media, the refractive index is negative.
(The fact that a conventional gain medium with e.g. in-
verted Lorentzian susceptibility yields positive Re n is
easily obtained using the deﬁnition of the refractive in-
dex.) The active, negative index medium above is clearly
right-handed, and at ω1 both phase velocity and Poynt-
ing’s vector point towards the source. The properties of
similar media are discussed in Refs. 6 and 8.

At oblique incidence, the interesting question is the

2

sign of kz = pn2ω2/c2 − k2
x rather than the sign of n.
Here the transversal wave number kx is assumed to be
real. First we assume that n2ω2/c2 − k2
x 6= 0 everywhere
in the upper half-plane. This is always the case for pas-
sive media1; however, as will be discussed below there
are active media for which the condition does not hold.
By causality, kz is identiﬁed as the analytic function of ω
in the upper half-plane that tends to +ω as Re ω → ∞.
It follows2 that kz must be a continuous function of kx.
Since the sign of Im k2
z is independent of kx, we can con-
clude that variation of kx does not alter the quadrant of
kz. In other words, the signs of Re kz and Im kz for any
real kx are equal to those of Re n and Im n, respectively.
Physically this means that if Re n < 0, we will get neg-
ative refraction at a boundary to vacuum, independent
of the angle of incidence. Also, if a wave is damped at
normal incidence, it is also damped at any other angle.
For large kx corresponding to evanescent waves in vac-
uum, we ﬁnd that the waves remain evanescent decaying
in semi-inﬁnite, passive materials. This was also noted
by Pendry.1

It is tempting to conclude that if a wave is ampli-
ﬁed at normal incidence, it will also be ampliﬁed for
large kx, corresponding to evanescent waves in vacuum.
However, in the previous paragraph we assumed that
n2ω2/c2 6= k2
x in the upper half-plane. In fact, most con-
ventional gain media do not satisfy this requirement. In-
deed, consider a weakly amplifying, inverted Lorentzian
medium with ǫ(ω) = 1 − f (ω) and µ(ω) = 1, where

f (ω) =

F ω2
0
ω2
0 − ω2 − iωΓ

.

(5)

Here, ω0, Γ, and F are positive parameters. Assuming
small bandwidth and gain, Γ/ω0 ≪ 1 and F ≪ Γ2/ω2
0,
we ﬁnd that n2ω2/c2 = k2
x is satisﬁed for kx = ω0/c and
ω = ω0(1 + iF ω0/Γ). Thus, although n has no branch
points in the upper half-plane, kz may have branch
points there. In such cases kz = kz(ω) clearly cannot be
identiﬁed as an analytic function in the upper half-plane.
The necessary branch cuts mean that kz loses its usual
interpretation for real frequencies. The physical, time-
domain electric ﬁeld is found by a Bromwich integral
above the branch cuts. Alternatively, one may integrate
along the real frequency axis (inverse Fourier transform);
however then contour integrals around the branch cuts in
the upper half-plane must be added to the result. These
integrals blow up with time and imply an instability as
seen from a ﬁxed position z. This result can be inter-
preted as follows: For nonzero kx, any causal excitation
involves necessarily the frequency where kz = 0. This
wave propagates an inﬁnite distance along the transver-
sal direction before arriving at the position z; thus it
1For passive media Im [n(ω)ω] > 0 for real frequencies. As the
function Im [n(ω)ω] is harmonic, Poisson’s integral formula ensures
that Im [n(ω)ω] > 0 remains valid in the upper half-plane.

2If the function kz(ω, kx) = pn2ω2/c2 − k2

x were discontinuous
in kx, we could ﬁnd a (ω, kx) and a tiny δ > 0 such that kz(ω, kx +
δ) ≈ −kz(ω, kx). This leads to a contradiction since kz(ω, kx) is
continuous in ω, and kz(ω, kx + δ) → kz(ω, kx) as Re ω → ∞.

picks up an inﬁnite amount of gain (in the absence of
saturation).

Finally, we note that for active media, no fundamental
principle prevents n from being purely imaginary with
Im n < 0, even in a semi-inﬁnite, causal medium. For
example, consider the causal medium ǫ(ω) = [1 − f (ω)]2
and µ(ω) = 1, where f (ω) is given by Eq. (5). Us-
ing the deﬁnition of the refractive index, we obtain
n(ω) = 1 − f (ω). Assuming F = 1 and Γ < ω0,
we ﬁnd n = −ipω2
0 − Γ2/Γ at the frequency given by
ω = pω2
0 − Γ2. Thus, using e.g. a unit-step modulated
sinusoidal source at z = 0 (plane wave at orthogonal in-
cidence), the monochromatic ﬁeld in the limit t → ∞
will be an increasing exponential as a function of z. This
result is in contrast to the statement in Refs. 3 and 4,
where n = −iα, α > 0 is claimed to be physically un-
accessible in semi-inﬁnite media. The medium will cer-
tainly saturate at large distances away from the source,
but this is not fundamentally diﬀerent from the situation
with ampliﬁed, propagating waves.

In conclusion, although the condition (4) for left-
handedness is valid even for active media, it is impossible
to give conditions for negative refraction that consider ǫ
and µ at a single frequency. In general it is impossible to
choose the right sign of n based on the single-frequency
Poynting vector. For nonzero transversal wave number,
one must be particularly careful: In many active me-
dia (e.g. practical low-gain media), the longitudinal wave
vector kz is not well-deﬁned for real frequencies. In pas-
sive media and the few active media where kz is mean-
ingful for real frequencies, the signs of Re kz and Im kz
are identical to those of Re n and Im n, respectively.

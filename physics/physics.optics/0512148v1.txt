A heuristic derivation of analytical expressions
describing the longitudinal evolution of ideal
nondiﬀracting pulses truncated by ﬁnite apertures.

Abstract

In this paper, starting from some general and plausible assumptions based on
geometrical optics and on a common feature of the truncated Bessel beams, a heuris-
tic derivation is presented of very simple analytical expressions, capable of describ-
ing the longitudinal (on-axis) evolution of ideal and axially-symmetric nondiﬀract-
ing pulses when truncated by ﬁnite apertures. We apply our analytical formula-
tion to several situations involving subluminal, luminal or superluminal localized
pulses and compare the results with those obtained by numerical simulations of the
Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diﬀraction integrals. The results are in excellent agreement.
The present approach can be very useful, because it can yield, in general, closed
analytical expressions, avoiding the need of time-consuming numerical simulations,
and also because such expressions provide a powerful tool for exploring several im-
portant properties of the truncated localized pulses, as their depth of ﬁelds, the
longitudinal pulse behavior, the decaying rates, and so on.

1 Introduction

Ideal nondiﬀracting pulses (INP) are inﬁnite energy solutions of the ordinary linear

wave equation, capable of maintaining their spatial shapes indeﬁnitely (sometimes with

just small local variations) while propagating[1-7]. When these ideal solutions are to

adapted to real situations and applications, they must be spatially truncated by a ﬁnite

aperture (i.e., generated by a ﬁnite aperture), getting transformed into ﬁnite energy so-

lutions, with ﬁnite ﬁeld depths, even if these ﬁeld-depths are very large when compared

to those of ordinary pulses.

When we truncate an INP, the resulting wave ﬁeld cannot be obtained, in general,

in analytical form. In this case one has to resort to the diﬀration theory and perform

numerical simulations of the diﬀraction integrals, such as that, well known, of Rayleigh-

Sommerfeld[8].

Indeed, one can get very important pieces of

information about a truncated

nondiﬀracting pulse (TNP) by performimg numerical simulations of its longitudinal

evolution[9-12], especially when the pulse is axially symmetric.

In this paper we shall show that, by using some general and plausible assumptions,

based on geometrical optics and on a common feature of truncated Bessel beams, a heuris-

tic derivation of simple analytical expressions is possible, capable of furnishing the lon-

gitudinal (on-axis) evolution of the TNPs. It is interesting to notice that this approach

depends only on the spectral structure of the corresponding INP.

We compare the results of our analytical method, when applied to several diﬀerent

situations involving subluminal, luminal or superluminal TNPs, with the results obtained

from the usual numerical simulation of the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integrals: the results are

in an excellent agreement.

This method, due to its extreme simplicity and analytical character, can be a powerful

tool for exploring several important properties of the TNPs, as their depth of ﬁelds,

2

the longitudinal pulse behavior, the decaying rates, etc.; for revealing the eﬀects of the

spectral parameters on the pulses evolution; and also for comparing the “eﬀectiveness” of

the diﬀerent kinds of TNPs, as the subluminal, luminal and superluminal ones. Without

this method, all those results could be reached (in each particular situation) only by

performing several time-consuming numerical simulations.

2 Heuristic approach for describing the on-axis evo-

lution of TNPs

Let us begin this section by making some comments about the truncated Bessel beams

and about some approximations, which will be used below for developing the method here

proposed.

Bessel beams

2.1 Some observations and approximations about truncated

An ideal (inﬁnite energy) Bessel beam (IBb) is given by

ΨIBb(ρ, z, t) = J0(kρρ)eiβze−

iωt

,

(1)

where ρ2 = x2 + y2 is the transverse coordinate, k2

ρ = ω2/c2

β2 is the transverse

−

wavenumber, β is the longitudinal wavenumber, and ω is the angular frequency.

An important parameter of an IBb is its axicon angle θ, where ω = cβ/ cos θ.

When a Bessel beam is truncated by a ﬁnite aperture of radius R, Eq.(1) cannot

be used to describe the resulting beam in the whole space. However, if the size of the

aperture is big enough to contain several bright rings of the ideal incident Bessel beam, i.e.,

if R >> 1/kρ, we can use geometrical optics to get some characteristics of the truncated

Bessel beam (TBb) evolution.

3

Figure 1: A typical Bessel beam truncated by a ﬁnite aperture.

In this case (see Fig.1), we can say that, in the spatial region localized inside the cone

oriented along the z-axis, with apex at z = Z = R/ tan θ and base given by the circular

aperture, the resulting TBb can be approximately described by Eq.(1).

However, when using geometrical optics, after the distance Z = R/ tan θ the on-axis

amplitude of the TBb becomes approximately zero (see Fig.1). The distance Z is called

the depth-ﬁeld of the TBb.

Keeping the above observations in mind, one may aﬃrm that, since R >> 1/kρ, the

on-axis behavior of a TBb can be approximately described by

ΨTBb(ρ = 0, z, t)

our heuristic method describing the on-axis TNP’s behavior.

According to the approximation Eq.(3), the on-axis ﬁeld intensity of a TBb is a

rectangular function with unitary value, till z = Z.

On the other hand, when a numerical simulation of the diﬀraction integrals is per-

formed, one can observe that the TBb presents some on-axis ﬁeld oscillations around the

unitary value, before suﬀering an abrupt decay after z = Z. Such oscillations cannot

be predict by geometrical optics, and arise only due to the abrupt truncation made by

the aperture. However, it is important to stress here that, despite the fact that those

oscillations are not predicted by Eq.(3), such an error is not present, in general, in the

case of our description of truncated localized pulses. One can understand this by noticing

that, since nondiﬀracting pulses are constructed through Bessel beams superpositions,

those oscillations, originating from each TBb, suﬀer a destructive interference.

With all this in mind, we are ready to develop our method.

2.2 The heuristic approach

It is well known[1-7] that axially-symmetric ideal nondiﬀracting pulses (INP) can be

made by zero order Bessel beam superpositions,

provided that the spectral function S(ω, β) entails a linear relationship of the type

between ω and β. In this way, by putting S(ω, β) = S(ω)δ(ω

> c. The positive quantities ωmin and ωmax are the minimum and maximum angular

frequency allowed for the Bessel beams in the superposition (6), and their values have to

be estimated as follows.

Once we have chosen the value of V in (6), the values of b, ωmin and ωmax are to

related between them in such a way that

In relation (7), the condition on kρ eliminates any unphysical behaviors of Bessel

functions and evanescent waves in Eq.(6). The second condition (β

0) eliminates any

≥

backwards-travelling Bessel beams in the same superposition, since we are considering

positive values of the angular frequency only.

Taking into account conditions (7), one has:

For Subluminal (V < c) INPs: b > 0, ωmin = b and ωmax = cb/(c

V )

For Luminal (V = c) INPs: b > 0, ωmin = b and ωmax =

The INPs provided by Eq.(6) can propagate without distortion indeﬁnitely, with

peak-velocity V .

Such INPs possess an inﬁnite energy, and so, for real applications, they must be

spatially truncated (i.e., generated by ﬁnite apertures)[9-12], resulting in ﬁnite energy

solutions, with a ﬁnite depth of ﬁeld.

When such truncation is made, the resulting pulse in general cannot be obtained in

an analytically form, but has to be numerically calculated from the diﬀraction theory,

by using, for example, the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld formula[9-12]. That is, once we have a

known INP solution ΨIN P , its truncated version ΨT N P , generated by a ﬁnite aperture of

radius R on the plane z = 0, results given by

between the source and observation points.

Due to its complexity, Eq.(8) has to be solved numerically in most cases.

Of particular interest is the on-axis behavior of ΨT N P . Actually, many important

information can be extracted from the evolution of ΨT N P (ρ = 0, z, t), like its depth of

ﬁeld, the pulse decaying rate, its longitudinal behavior, the eﬀects of the diﬀerent spectral

parameters on the pulse evolution; and, even more important, quantity ΨT N P (ρ = 0, z, t)

can be used to compare the performance of diﬀerent kinds of TNP, as for example, the

luminal and the superluminal ones.

On considering axially-symmetric TNP, and making ρ = 0 in Eq.(8), we get some

simpliﬁcations, because the integration on φ′ can be immediately done: But, even in this

case, the integration on ρ′ rarely can be carried on analytically, due to the complexity of

the integrand, and numerical simulations are once more required.

7

To overcome this problem, let us propose the following heuristic approach:

First, we consider the Bessel beam superposition (6), which provides us with the

Second, we make the assumption that each Bessel beam, with frequency ω and axicon

angle θ(ω), entering in superposition (6), obeys the following condition:

R >>

The above assumption is very plausible, since eﬃcient TNPs are generate by large

INPs.

apertures.

Once condition (9) is fulﬁlled by all Bessel beams in superposition (6), we can use

again the geometrical optics and assume that, after the truncation, the on-axis behavior

of each one of those Bessel beams can be approximated by Eq.(3).

Third, taking into account Eqs.(3) and (6), we may conjecture that the on-axis evo-

lution of the truncate nondiﬀracting pulse is approximately given by:

the Bessel beam with angular frequency ω.

We should notice that in the integrand of (10), the step function H(z

where the ﬁrst term in the r.h.s. of (11) is nothing but the INP ΨIN P (ρ = 0, z, t), while

Now, remembering that for a Bessel beam of axicon angle θ we have ω = cβ/ cos θ, and

that the spectra of INPs impose the constraint ω = V β + b between angular frequencies

and longitudinal wavenumbers, it becomes easy to show that

Closed, analytical results and their compari-

The method we have developed in the previous Section is described by Eqs.(16),

(18), (20, 21), for the cases of truncated subluminal, luminal and superluminal pulses,

respectively.

We are going to apply, now, this method to some important cases involving TNPs; and

it will be shown that the results agree very well with those obtained through numerical

simulations of the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld formula (8).

Now, we want to describe the on-axis behavior of the truncated version (ΨT N P ) of the

the ideal solution (22).

The subluminal INP (22) is generated by the superposition (6), with a constant

spectrum S(ω) = c/(2bV γ2). However, we have to notice that this solution possesses

backwards-travelling components: Actually, it has ωmin = bc/(c + V ), instead of ωmin = b

15

(which assures forward components only in (6), as we have seen in Section 2). It is the

price paid to get such a closed and exact INP solution.

Anyway, we may, and we must, minimize the contribution of those “backwards” com-

ponents by choosing the subluminal velocity V in such a way that (c + V )/(c

V ) >> 1.

−

Once this condition is satisﬁed, we can observe that the INP (22) is, then, similar to that

which would be obtained with the same S(ω), but with ωmin = b.

It should be noticed that the comments and observations above have nothing to do

with our method, which is constructed since the beginning in order to comprehend causal

(forward) solutions only, and can be used for any values of the velocity V . Those remarks

were made just in order that a causal behavior of the INP (22) be guaranteed.

Now, on using S(ω) = c/(2bV γ2) in our Eq.(16), which describes the on-axis evolution

of the subluminal TNPs, one gets

the cases (1),(2) and (3) respectively. The continuous lines are the results obtained from

We can observe, once more, a very good agreement among the results, conﬁrming

that our method works very well.

Like all the INPs, the FWM possesses inﬁnite energy and must be truncated (i.e.,

generated by a ﬁnite aperture) for real applications. We shall use our method to get

closed, analytical expressions for the on-axis evolution of the truncated version ΨT N P of

Eq.(24).

The exact ideal solution (24) is obtained from the superposition (6) with V = c

and S(ω) = aexp(ab/2)exp(

aω). Because it has ωmin = b/2, instead of ωmin = b, its

−

spectrum possesses backwards components[1-6] in the range b/2

ω < b. To overcome

≤

this problem, we must minimize the contribution of the nonphysical part of the spectrum;

and this can be done if ab << 1. Once such a condition is obeyed, the INP (24) can be

considered similar to the one that we would obtain with the same frequency spectrum of

the FWM, but with ωmin = b.

Again, let us notice that such remarks are made just to validate the causality of the

INP (24), and have nothing to do with our own method.

Now, by using S(ω) = aexp(ab/2)exp(

aω) in our Eq.(18), we get the on-axis evolu-

Now, we are going to use our Eq.(25) to show the on-axix evolution of this TNP, in

t′′′ = 0.66 ns.

The results are in excellent agreement, showing the very good eﬃciency of the method.

3.3 The method applied to the truncated Superluminal Focus

Wave Mode pulse

An interesting, approximated, superluminal (V > c) ideal nondiﬀracting solution to

the wave equation is the so-called[6] Superluminal Focus Wave Mode pulse (SFWM):

Expression (21) is a very good aproximate solution of the wave equation[6] if ab << 1,

which is also the condition for minimizing the contribution of the backwards components

of (21). Actually, this superluminal INP can be obtained from superposition (6), with

b > 0, when using S(ω) = aexp(ab/2)exp(

aω), with constant a > 0, but with ωmin = b/2

−

instead of ωmin = b.

To get the closed, analytical mathematical expression that describes the on-axis evo-

lution of the truncated version of (26), let us put S(ω) = aexp(ab/2)exp(

of the cases cited above.

4 Conclusion

minal or superluminal.

In this paper we have developed a very simple heuristic method for describing the

space-time on-axis evolution of truncated nondiﬀracting pulses, be them subluminal, lu-

It is important to notice that in our method, given by Eqs.(16), (18), (20, 21), the

on-axis evolution of a TNP depends only on the frequency spectrum S(ω) of its corre-

sponding INP ΨIN P , contrary to the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld formula (8), which depends on

the mathematical expression of ΨIN P .

Due to this simplicity, we can obtain closed analytical expressions describing the

on-axis evolution of innumerable TNPs. And in this paper we have done this for the

truncated versions of some very well known (ideal) localized waves, subluminal, luminal,

and superluminal.

We have compared our results with those obtained through the numerical simulation

of the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integrals, and we have observed an excellent agreement among

24

them, conﬁrming the eﬃciency of our method.

The present approach can be very useful, because it furnishes, in general, closed

analytical expressions, avoiding the need of time-consuming numerical simulations; and

also because such expressions provide a powerful tool for exploring several important

properties of the truncated localized pulses: as their depth of ﬁeld, the longitudinal pulse

behavior, the decaying rates, etc.

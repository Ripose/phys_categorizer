Quantum control of optical four-wave mixing with femtosecond ω-3ω laser pulses:
coherent ac Stark nonlinear spectroscopy

(Dated: January 19, 2014)

The four-wave mixing produced with two ultrashort phase-locked ω-3ω laser pulses propagating
coherently in a two-level system in the infrared spectral region is shown to depend on the pulses
relative phase. The Maxwell-Bloch equations are solved beyond the rotating-wave approximation to
account for ﬁeld frequencies which are largely detuned from the atomic resonance. The relative phase
dominating the eﬃciency of the coupling to the 5ω anti-Stokes Raman component is determined
by sign of the total ac Stark shift induced in the system, in such a way that the phase inﬂuence
disappears precisely where the ac Stark eﬀect due to both pulses is compensated. This fundamental
quantum interference eﬀect can be the basis for nonlinear ultrafast optical spectroscopy techniques.

Phenomena arising from the coherent control of non-
linear interactions are of importance in ﬁelds as diverse as
optoelectronics and materials research, in high harmonic
generation, in photoionization or molecular dissociation,
and in biological applications such as spectroscopy and
imaging, among others [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Optical quan-
tum coherent control is based on the fact that the phases
of interfering transition amplitudes in light-matter inter-
actions can be controlled through the optical phase of
coherent light sources that drive the interaction, in such
a way that the transition rates to ﬁnal states and the dy-
namics at various stages of the process can be modiﬁed
[1].

In a recent paper [8], a theoretical investigation on
the quantum coherent control of the optical transient
four-wave mixing of two intense phase-locked femtosec-
ond laser pulses of central angular frequencies ω and 3ω
propagating in a two-level atom (TLA) was reported. It
was shown how the nonlinear (χ(3)) coupling to the anti-
Stokes Raman ﬁeld at frequency 5ω depends critically on
the initial relative phase φ of the propagating pulses. In
Ref. [8], the study was centered to intense pulses in the
visible and ultraviolet spectral regions, with frequencies
at resonance or lower than the atomic transition. The
phenomena observed in [8], however, can be scaled to var-
ious laser and material parameters. In the infrared spec-
tral range, for instance, experiments on ultrafast molec-
ular dynamics are frequently performed by help of two-
color pump probe nonlinear spectroscopy techniques. In
this type of studies, due to the high intensities inherent to
ultrashort (subpicosecond) pulses, nonlinear eﬀects such
as stimulated Raman processes may become important
and are often utilized as a complementary tool to gain
information [9].

In this Letter, we address the conditions for quan-
tum coherent control of transient four-wave mixing in-
teractions with two phase-locked ω-3ω femtosecond laser
pulses in the mid-IR spectral region. Our purpose is to
reveal the basic physics for a strict two-level medium and
to this end the Maxwell-Bloch TLA will be considered.
We will study pulses with a duration of 300 fs (with a

108 W/cm2, which are typically used in infrared non-
∼
linear spectroscopy experiments [9]. We will examine the
inﬂuence of frequency detuning by considering the ﬁeld at
3ω above resonance with respect to the atomic transition,
something that was not considered in [8]. Under these
conditions, we will show that the quantum interferences
leading to a dominating eﬃciency of the nonlinear cou-
pling to the anti-Stokes Raman component are governed
by the ac Stark shift induced in the system. Furthermore,
we will demonstrate that the relative spectral amplitude
of the anti-Stokes ﬁelds produced by phase-locked pulses
cancels for frequency detunings that compensate the ac
Stark eﬀect. This fundamental interference eﬀect might
be the basis for a novel ultrafast spectroscopy tool based
on coherent control, which we name coherent ac Stark
nonlinear spectroscopy (CSNS) for use later below.

The pulse propagation is modeled by means of the
Maxwell-Bloch equations beyond the rotating-wave ap-
proximation, allowing the resonant as well as the non-
resonant regimes of the system to be described [1]. The

is externally injected to the system. The peak input elec-
tric ﬁeld amplitude E0 is chosen the same for both pulses
108 W/cm2. The dura-
and results in an intensity of 4.0
tion of the pulses is given by tp = τp/1.763, with τp = 300
fs being the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the
pulse intensity envelope. t0 gives the oﬀset position of
the pulse center at t = 0, and it is the reference value
for the phase of the pulses. The central angular frequen-
cies of the pulses are ω and 3ω, and φ is the relative
phase. The propagating system has been resolved nu-
merically by means of a standard ﬁnite diﬀerence time
domain method described elsewhere [8].

Figure 2 shows the ﬁeld spectra at diﬀerent propaga-
tion lengths in the case that the central angular frequency
of the ﬁeld E3ω is at resonance with the atomic transition
(3ω = ω12). The spectrum on the top is for the initial
pulses. The succeeding plots show the evolution of the
spectrum as the pulses propagate through the medium.
In this case, we can observe the eﬀect of the absorption
of the pulse at 3ω, together with the appearance of other
spectral contributions at 5ω, 7ω, and 9ω, which are pro-
duced as a result of the coupling of the ﬁelds through the
third order nonlinearity (χ(3)) of the medium. It is clear
that the conversion to the anti-Stokes Raman component
(5ω) depends on the relative phase between the pulses.
For the parameter values of the results shown in Fig. 2,
the coupling to the ﬁfth harmonic (5ω) is more eﬃcient
for φ = 0 than for φ = π, an scenario that was already
reported in Ref. [8] for a transition in the visible region.

sition. Each spectrum is plotted in logarithmic scale. The
relative spectral amplitude of the anti-Stokes 5ω components
is shown quantitatively for z = 25 µm in Fig. 3 (case with
η = 9.0).

Hence here we conﬁrm that observed in Ref. [8] for a dif-
ferent system, particularly, considering a mid-IR atomic
transition. It is important to note that this phase depen-
dence eﬀect involves the anti-Stokes Raman component
(5ω) only, not the 7ω nor the 9ω spectral components,
which remain insensitive to the initial relative phase of
the pulses.

We now turn to the study of the frequency detuning
of the ﬁelds with respect to the atomic transition. We
will show that there is a central pulse frequency ω at
which the relative phase dependence of the coupling to
the anti-Stokes Raman component, which has been pre-
viously discussed in Fig. 2, disappears. We will observe
that this eﬀect can occur because the ac Stark shifts pro-
duced in the medium by the ﬁelds Eω and E3ω can be
compensated when ω < ω12 < 3ω. We will then conclude
that the ac Stark shift in the medium governs the relative
phase dependence of the coherent four-wave coupling.

Indeed, the ac Stark frequency shift ∆ω produced by
a ﬁeld of frequency ω which is not near resonance in a
transition of frequency ω12 can be expressed as [11]:

Note that the last term inside the brackets in Eq. (5) is
important far from resonance, where the rotating wave
approximation does not apply. Clearly from Eq.
(5),
when ω > ω12 we have ∆ω < 0, and the separation in
frequency of the states (ω12 +∆ω) appears to be less than
in the absence of the ﬁeld. Contrarily, for ω < ω12, the
ac Stark frequency shift is positive.

In the case of the present investigation, the main con-
tributions to the ac Stark eﬀect come from the two com-
ponents of the propagating pulses Eω and E3ω, which
have central angular frequencies ω and 3ω, respectively,
and the conditions for Eq. (5) are clearly met for the
parameter values of our study. Therefore, requiring that
the combined ac Stark eﬀect is null

We will next show that the ac Stark cancellation fre-
quency ω = ω12/√5 is indeed observed with accuracy
from numerical simulations.
In Figure 3, the spectral
amplitude of the anti-Stokes 5ω component is shown
for diﬀerent values of the detuning between the ﬁelds
and the atomic transition at a propagation length such
as z = 25µm.
It is useful to deﬁne the parameter
η = (ω12/ω)2, which sets the value of the detuning of the
Eω and E3ω ﬁelds. The spectra corresponding to φ = 0
is shown by solid lines in Fig. 3, while the spectra for
φ = π is represented by the dashed lines. Clearly, there
is a switch in the tendency to dominate the conversion to

the 5ω anti-Stokes component. For η < 5, the ac Stark
shift due to Eω dominates over the shift induced by E3ω,
and therefore the resulting separation of the states due
to the combined Stark eﬀect appears to be larger than in
the absence of ﬁelds. In this situation, the coupling to the
5ω anti-Stokes ﬁeld is enhanced for φ = π, as it can be
observed in Fig. 3, left plots. Contrarily, for η > 5, when
the ac Stark shift due to E3ω dominates over the shift
induced by Eω, the coupling to the 5ω anti-Stokes Ra-
man component is enhanced for φ = 0 (right plots in Fig.
3). In this last case the resulting separation in frequency
of the states due to the total Stark eﬀect is less than in
the absence of ﬁelds. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3,
the switching occurs at η = 5, where the total ac Stark
shift is cancelled, as expected from Eq. 6. Note that for
the numerical simulations to agree with the prediction
of the analytical theory, the expression for the Stark ef-
fect beyond the rotating wave approximation needs to be
considered (see Eq. (33) in Ref. [11]).

We now look at the relative spectral amplitude of the

anti-stokes Raman ﬁelds, which we deﬁne as

with E0
5ω(z) being the spectral amplitude at the gen-
erated anti-Stokes (5ω) frequency in the case that the
initial relative phase is φ = 0 (see Fig. 3), and Eπ
5ω(z)
being the spectral amplitude at 5ω in the case that the
initial relative phase between the pulses is φ = π. Figure
4 shows the results obtained from the numerical simula-
tions for z = 25µm. Relative diﬀerences in amplitudes as

sidered in our simulations. Moreover, we have checked
that the relative phase dependence at η = 5.0 remains
null for propagation distances as long as z = 100µm.

We have therefore demonstrated that considering the
coherent propagation of two-color phase-locked femtosec-
ond pulses in a two-level medium, with central angu-
lar frequencies ω and 3ω, one can ﬁnd an angular fre-
quency ω at which the ac Stark eﬀect produced by the

propagating pulses is cancelled. At this frequency value,
which requires the pulse with central frequency 3ω to be
above resonance with respect to the atomic transition,
the phase dependence of the transient four-wave coupling
through the χ(3) nonlinear susceptibility of the medium
disappears. This is a fundamental quantum interference
eﬀect that to the best of our knowledge has not been
reported before.

In the present Letter, we have considered atomic fre-
quencies which lie in the mid-IR region, which are of
interest for applications e.g.
in infrared nonlinear spec-
troscopic techniques. It has to be stressed however that
the phenomena that we report can be scaled to several
material and pulse parameters. We can hence imagine
straightforward applications for nonlinear ultrafast spec-
troscopy techniques based on the coherent control of sub-
picosecond two-color ω-3ω propagating laser pulses. In-
deed, the production of phase related ω-3ω pulses is fre-
quently accomplished by some frequency trippling mech-
anism with the subsequent variation of the phase of one
of the pulses in order to obtain experimental control over
the relative phase. Although our analysis has obviously
been simpliﬁed by considering two well isolated levels as
a ﬁrst approach, the switching eﬀect discussed here is of
a fundamental level, and in that sense it should be ob-
served experimentally in particular media where the two-
level approximation is met. For instance, some gaseous
rubidium
atoms have well isolated resonances (as e.g.
in the visible region). Also, the two-level approximation
can be used for studying coherent eﬀects in materials

4

with a broad distribution of transitions, such as inho-
mogeneously broadened resonance lines in gases and in
condensed matter, and even for inhomogeneous quasi-
continuous energy bands as in semiconductors [12, 13].
CSNS can hence provide information on the transitions
being probed by measuring the relative spectral ampli-
tude of the anti-Stokes Raman ﬁelds with a simple scan
of the laser frequency. The ac Stark mediated coherent
control scenario reported in this Letter has therefore a
broad interest and may be the basis for future studies on
more complex systems.

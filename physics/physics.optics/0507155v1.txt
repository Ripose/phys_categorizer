Abstract

Under certain conditions, a transparent photonic band can be designed into a one-

dimensional metallodielectric nanoﬁlm structure. Unlike conventional pass bands in

photonic crystals, where the ﬁnite thickness of the structure aﬀects the transmission

of electromagnetic ﬁelds having frequency within the pass band, the properties of the

transparent band are almost unaﬀected by the ﬁnite thickness of the structure.

In

other words, an incident ﬁeld at a frequency within the transparent band exhibits 100%

transmission independent of the number of periods of the structure. The transparent

photonic band corresponds to excitation of pure eigenstate modes across the entire Bloch

band in structures possessing mirror symmetry. The conditions to create these modes

1

and thereby to lead to a totally transparent band phenomenon are discussed.

1 Introduction

Propagation of electromagnetic waves through periodic structures has both fundamental

interest and potential applications because of the possibility of controlling optical

properties of materials through photonic band gaps[1]–[3]. Strictly speaking, a band

diagram describes properties of an inﬁnite periodic structure. In ﬁnite structures, there

are transmission resonances inside pass bands[3], i.e. minibands separated by minigaps

as demonstrated by the experiment[4]. The bandwidth and central frequency of each

resonance change with the number of the periods. The ﬁnite thickness or termination

of photonic crystals (PhCs) has a signiﬁcant impact on the dispersive properties of the

structure[5]–[7] and hence aﬀects transmission properties. In particular, the transmission

coeﬃcient of a plane wave having frequency within the pass band exhibits a thickness-

dependent periodic oscillation. This thickness-dependent transmission oscillation and

length-sensitive behavior of the PhCs can impact many potential applications and

photonics integrations. In this paper, we analyze transmission features of photonic bands

and show that under certain conditions a transparent photonic band can be formed

in one-dimensional metallodielectric nanoﬁlms. The term, transparent photonic band,

3

refers to two signiﬁcant diﬀerences from the conventional pass bands. First, there are no

minigaps and minibands inside the transparent band in a ﬁnite structure. Second, the

electromagnetic ﬁelds having frequency within the transparent band exhibit complete

transmission independent of the number of periods of the structure. The properties of

the transparent band are almost unaﬀected by the ﬁnite thickness of the structure and

this is the major diﬀerence when compared to the conventional pass bands. The existence

of the transparent band depends on the surface plasmon excitation and the manner in

which the ﬁrst and last layers are truncated. More precisely, the transparent band

corresponds to pure eigenstate excitations across the entire Bloch band in structures

possessing mirror symmetry. Each frequency in the transparent band is in an eigenstate

common to translation and surface-wave operators. In the transparent band, the electric

ﬁeld intensity is symmetric across the length of the structure. The mirror symmetry of

the physical structure is essential for the existence of the transparent photonic band.

The conditions to create this totally transparent phenomenon will be discussed in the

following sections. In this regard, we cite an earlier experiment exploring the possibility

of rendering a layered metallic structure to be transparent[8].

plasmon

resonant waveguide

2
(CPRW)

The investigation is performed with a 1D structure that has alternating layers of metal

and dielectric materials. The essential physics of the 1D structures should be equally

applicable to higher dimensional structures while avoiding intensive computational tasks

of higher dimensionality. Also, the 1D structure is relatively easy to fabricate. In the

direction perpendicular to the layers, the waveguiding is achieved through evanescent

coupling of surface plasmons between interfaces of metal/dielectric layers, i.e. a coupled-

plasmon-resonant waveguide (CPRW). The CPRW described here is a special case of the

coupled-resonator optical waveguide (CROW) proposed by Yariv et al[9]. Diﬀering from

the conventional PhCs, the band structures in the CROWs are formed from localized

resonant modes through evanescent coupling. Speciﬁcally, for the CPRW structure

presented here, the evanescent coupling is achieved through a coupled chain of surface

plasmon excitations at each interface, conveying the ﬁelds from layer to layer throughout

the entire structure. Meanwhile, the surface plasmons provide a large ﬁeld enhancement

at the interfaces of metal/dielectric layers. The metallodielectric structures studied

5

previously in the context of PhCs[10]–[12] where the Bloch modes of traveling waves were

considered. Here we will explore this type of structure from the perspective of the CROW

and focus on the Bloch modes of the evanescent waves. In our case, the ﬁelds inside each

layer are evanescent along the propagation direction of the Bloch waves, i.e. the direction

perpendicular to the interfaces of the layers. In the CPRW structure, the waveguiding is

achieved simultaneously parallel to the interfaces and perpendicular to the interfaces with

diﬀerent guiding mechanisms. Parallel to the interfaces, the electromagnetic ﬁelds are

guided by the surface plasmons whereas perpendicular to the interfaces the waveguiding

is achieved through the evanescent coupling. In such structures, we focus on the scenario

that the ﬁeld is evanescent inside all the layers, yet, a 100% transmission can still be

achieved for inﬁnitely thick composite materials. To achieve this goal, the nature of the

surface plasmons is well suited to periodically amplify the evanescent ﬁelds at each metal-

dielectric interface. Due to the surface plasmon resonance and large ﬁeld amplitudes at

the interfaces, the termination of the CPRW structure can have a dramatic eﬀect on

the transmission and this can be more pronounced than in the conventional photonic

crystals.

3 Theory

Figure 1 shows a one-dimensional lossless metallodielectric multilayer structure. The

period is d = d1 + d2 where d1 and d2 are the thicknesses of the dielectric and metallic

layers. The subscript 1 refers to the dielectric medium with non-dispersive permittivity

(ǫ1) and permeability (µ1). The subscript 2 refers to the metallic material with constant

µ2, and dispersive ǫ2(ω) = 1 − ω2

p/ω2 where ωp is the bulk plasma frequency. In general,

the ωp is a function of not only electron density but also surface structure, such as

subwavelength holes or slits. We assume the surface plasmon waves propagate along the

ˆx direction with wave number Kp and consider TM polarization with E = (Ex, 0, Ez ).

The electric ﬁeld in the nth unit cell[13] is given by En(r) = En(z) exp (iKpx), where

the evanescent portion of the ﬁelds are

En(z) =

an exp[−α1zn] + bn exp[α1(zn − d1)],
0 ≤ zn < d1
cn exp[−α2(zn − d1)] + dn exp[α2(zn − d)], d1 < zn ≤ d

(

.

(1)

where zn = z − nd and αi =

K 2

p − k2

0ǫiµi > 0, i = 1, 2. The ﬁeld amplitudes an, bn, cn,

q

and dn are vectors in the ˆx–ˆz plane. The relationship between these amplitudes can

be found by enforcing the boundary conditions and the fact that ∇ · E = 0 inside each

layer.

7

Using the Bloch theorem, the evanescent condition K 2

p > k2

0ǫ1µ1, and the material

dispersion ǫ2(ω) = 1 − (ωp/ω)2, with ω < 0.6 ωp, the band structure of the coupled

evanescent ﬁelds is obtained and these results are shown in Fig. 2 for diﬀerent layer

thicknesses. The blue zones represent the pass bands of the evanescent ﬁelds,

i.e.

the Bloch modes of the evanescent ﬁelds. For each period, the mode amplitudes are

symmetric in the lower frequency band and anti-symmetric in the upper band. These

modes possess features of both surface plasmons and Bloch waves. Both transmission

pass bands are below the light line of the dielectric medium and this means that the

ﬁelds are evanescent not only in the metal layers but also in the dielectric layers. The

upper band is truncated at the light line so that the modes are evanescent and bounded

to the metal/dielectric interfaces. In this paper, we only consider resonant transmission

of bounded surface modes. In this scenario, all the layers must be thin enough to allow

overlap of the evanescent ﬁelds associated with the bounded surface modes. Notice

that the ﬁeld decays exponentially inside each layer and is ampliﬁed at each interface.

If any layer is too thick such that the ampliﬁcation at the interface cannot overcome

the exponential decay inside the layer, there will be no transmission. However, the

8

total thickness of the structure can be inﬁnite provided that each layer is suﬃciently

thin to allow coupled eigenstates throughout the entire structure. Hence, the periodic

ampliﬁcation by the surface plasmon at each interface delivers the evanescent ﬁeld from

the ﬁrst layer of the structure to the last layer.

4 Numerical results

The band diagrams in Fig. 2 describe the transmission properties of an inﬁnitely

periodic structure. Since a practical structure will have a ﬁnite number of periods,

the transmission properties are generally dependent on the thickness of the structure.

The transmission coeﬃcient of the ﬁnite structure can be calculated using a transfer

matrix method. The incident plane wave is coupled with the Bloch evanescent modes

via superstrate and substrate coupling prisms and this allows excitation of the surface

plasmon ﬁeld.

Figure 3 shows the evolution of the photonic bands with increasing the number of

periods of the structure. The plots on the left and right sides correspond to diﬀerent

surface plasmon wave numbers where Kp = 2.7π/d on the left and Kp = 1.6π/d on the

right. The layer thicknesses d1 and d2 in Fig. 3 are the same as those in Fig. 2(b). There

9

are two pass bands associated with each surface plasmon excitation. The correlation

between the band diagrams and transmission spectra can be seen by comparing Fig. 3(c)

and (f) with Fig. 2(b).

In Fig. 3(c) and (f), there are four transmission pass bands

centered about 820, 855, 625 and 725 THz. The 820, 625 and 725 THz bands are not

transparent bands and the rapid oscillations within these pass bands are mini-resonances.

The transmission coeﬃcient is very sensitive to the frequency. The band centered about

855 THz in Fig. 3(c) is the transparent photonic band. This transparent band has a ﬂat

top spectrum and is almost immune from the rapid oscillation. The bandwidth of the

transparent band is almost unchanged after the ﬁrst few periods.

The striking feature of the transparent band is that it allows 100% transmission

independent of the thickness of the structure. This thickness-independent transmission

is illustrated in Fig. 4(a) and this feature is due to the single mode (pure eigenstate)

character of the transparent band. As a comparison, Fig. 4(b) and (c) show the thickness-

dependent transmission of the non-transparent pass bands and that the transmission

coeﬃcients periodically oscillate with the number of periods of the structure. Finally,

Fig. 4(d) describes the character of the stop band where the transmission decays

10

exponentially with increasing the number of the periods.

To better understand the transparent phenomenon, Fig. 5 shows the evolution of

Bloch wavevector KB versus the number of the periods. The frequencies in these plots

correspond to those in Fig. 4. For the stop band in Fig. 5(d) the value of KB decays

exponentially with the number of the periods and eventually becomes imaginary. In the

transparent band Fig. 5(a), the Bloch wavevector is constant and satisﬁes the dispersion

of the inﬁnite structure. So, each frequency in the transparent band is in a pure eigenstate

of the translation operator, and the ﬁeld resembles a plane wave with a single KB for

each frequency. The propagation direction is given by the surface plasmon and Bloch

wavevectors (Kp, KB). For the other two cases, KB oscillates with a large amplitude

for the ﬁrst few periods, then it converges to oscillate about the KB of the inﬁnite

structure with a small amplitude as shown in plots Fig. 5(b) and (c). The spread of the

KB is much less than the size of the Brillouin zone, i.e. ∆KB ≪ 2π/d. The k-plots

explain the oscillation and wave-packet phenomenon in the transmission coeﬃcients.

The carrier of the oscillation is determined by the KB of the inﬁnite structure, whereas

the envelope of the oscillation is inversely proportional to the bandwidth of the KB.

11

The stronger the coupling, the wider the spatial extent of the transmission coeﬃcient,

and hence the narrower the bandwidth in the k-space. Thus, unlike the transparent

band, each frequency in the conventional pass bands is in a superposition state, i.e. a

superposition of the Bloch modes with the major component given by the corresponding

inﬁnite structure. Notice that the positions of the nodes in Figs. 5(b) are the same as the

positions of the maximum transmission in Fig. 4(b). The 100% transmission happens

when the Bloch wavevector matches that of the corresponding inﬁnite structure. The

number of the periods (N ) between the peaks satisﬁes the relation KBN d ≈ m2π, where

m is an integer.

5 Unit cell conﬁguration

The unit cell conﬁguration is very important to achieve the transparent photonic band.

This is because the unit cell determines how the metal-dielectric structure is physically

terminated. First, the unit cell M1/2DM1/2 or D1/2M D1/2 can yield a transparent band,

but the M D conﬁguration does not. Note that for a metal-dielectric structure made up

of N unit cells, the cases (M1/2DM1/2)N and (D1/2M D1/2)N are terminated identically

at the both ends whereas the case (M D)N is not. Analyzing the ﬁeld distribution inside

12

the structure can provide physical insight. Figure 6 shows the intensity distribution

inside an isolated unit cell M1/2DM1/2. There is naturally a ﬁeld enhancement at

the interfaces of the metal/dielectric layers due to the bounded surface waves. The

case for the transparent band is shown in Fig. 6(a), where the intensity distribution

is symmetric.

In Fig. 6(b) and (c), the ﬁelds are not symmetric and are outside the

transparent band. Here is the key point: the intensity is symmetric in the unit cell when

the transparent photonic band is excited. Thus, each frequency in the transparent band

is in an eigenstate of the surface-wave operator since the symmetric and anti-symmetric

ﬁelds are the eigenmodes of the surface waves. It is evident that when the unit cells

that have mirror symmetry are layered together, the resulting modes can ﬁt easily with

a minimal adjustment. On the other hand, if the non-symmetric M D cell is layered,

the modes do not ﬁt together and this results in large ﬁeld discontinuities and mode

splittings. The ﬁelds of the two resonant peaks in Fig. 3(d) also exhibit unit transmission

regardless of the length of the structure, and the ﬁeld amplitude distribution is symmetric

for the lower frequency and anti-symmetric for the higher frequency. However, they are

isolated frequencies without the bandwidth, unlike the case in Fig. 3(c) that the entire

13

Bloch band is excited into the transparent band.

Shown in Fig. 7 is a comparison of the transmission spectra of the three

conﬁgurations, (M D)N , (M1/2DM1/2)N , and (D1/2M D1/2)N . For the same constituent

materials and layer thicknesses, the excitation condition for the transparent photonic

band is diﬀerent for the conﬁgurations (M1/2DM1/2)N and (D1/2M D1/2)N . Also, the

transparent band is excited in the upper band for the (M1/2DM1/2)N and in the lower

band for the (D1/2M D1/2)N . In contrast with the unit cells M1/2DM1/2 and D1/2M D1/2

where the bandwidth of the transparent band is almost unchanged upon increasing the

number of the periods, the mode of the unit cell M D cannot survive. When two M D

cells are brought together the mode is split as shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b). On the other

hand, when the (M1/2DM1/2)N or (D1/2M D1/2)N cells are brought together, the pass

band splits into a transparent band and a non-transparent band. In the conﬁgurations

(M1/2DM1/2)N or (D1/2M D1/2)N , the two end surfaces are identical and that, under

the proper excitation condition, can lead to a strong coupling of the two surface modes

throughout a series of plasmon excitations at the interior metal-dielectric interfaces.

Hence, the unit cells of the metallodielectric periodical structures can have a great impact

14

on the transmission properties. Since the transparent band corresponds to the excitation

of the entire Bloch band, the bandwidth of the transparent band can be up to 100 THz

with a ﬂat-top spectrum depending on the thickness of the layers.

Shown in Fig. 8 are the transmission spectrum, dispersion, and group velocity of a

5-period CPRW. In the dispersion plot, the four lines of small slope in the lower band

contain dispersion signature of the CPRW in a weak coupling limit and may be useful

in a light stopping scheme[14]. The large slope line sitting on the upper branch of the

dispersion curves of the inﬁnite structure is the dispersion of the transparent band. It

occupies the entire positive k-space in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. This indeed conﬁrms that

the transparent band is an excitation of the entire Bloch band.

6 Conclusions

We have analyzed the transmission features of photonic bands in the one-dimensional all-

evanescent metallodielectric structure. The transparent photonic band can be excited

in the ﬁnite structure provided that the structure is composed with unit cells having

mirror symmetry. This has the crucial property of allowing very eﬃcient coupling of an

incident beam into the surface plasmon modes of the metal-dielectric structure. With

15

this and the proper excitation condition, the transmission from the input side to the

output side of the metal-dielectric structure can be 100% independent of the number

of periods of the structure. The transparent photonic band may also exist in other

CROW structures. Since the surface plasmon and evanescent coupling is a means to

propagate light inside nanocircuits, the investigation of the coupled surface plasmons

in the multilayer structures provides us with fundamental knowledge for the future

3D multilayer integration of the nanocircuits. The structures considered here can be

fabricated with existing nanotechnology.

Figure 1: One-dimensional alternating layers of dielectric (subscript 1)
and metallic materials (subscript 2). The thicknesses of the dielectric and
metal layers are d1 and d2, respectively, with period d = d1 + d2. This
schematic shows two type unit cells, M D and M1/2DM1/2. The unit cell
M1/2DM1/2 is deﬁned by the section between two dashed lines in the middle
of the metallic layers, so the unit cell possesses mirror symmetry whereas
the unit cell M D does not. The surface plasmon wavevector is Kp = ˆxKp
and the Bloch wavevector is KB = ˆzKB.
If the number of layers N is
inﬁnite, the conﬁguration of the unit cell would not be important, but for
the ﬁnite number of layers, this is very important in terms of the transparent
photonic band. In other words, the termination of the multilayer structure
is important. The thicknesses of the layers are suﬃciently thin such that
the surface plasmon ﬁelds are evanescently coupled along the ˆz direction
throughout the multilayer structure.

plots (a), (b), and (c) have Kp = 2.7π/d and two pass bands. The band
centered around 850 THz is a transparent band, and the band centered
around 820 THz is not the transparent band. The plots in (d), (e), and
(f) have Kp = 1.6π/d and neither pass band has the characteristics of
the transparent band. The important distinction between the transparent
and non-transparent bands is that within the transparent band, the ﬁeld
intensity is symmetric in the unit cell. Also, unlike the transparent
band, the transmission in the non-transparent band oscillates rapidly with
changing frequency.

Figure 6:
Intensity distribution within a single unit cell M1/2DM1/2
as deﬁned in Fig. 1. In (a)-(c) above, the parameters F and Kp can be
correlated with those in Fig. 3 for N = 1. In (a) above, the intensity is
symmetric and this is within the transparent band as seen from Fig. 3(a).
In (b) and (c) above, the ﬁelds are not symmetric and are outside the
transparent band.

Figure 7: Transmission spectra showing evolution of the photonic bands
with the number of periods N for the three conﬁgurations (M D)N ,
(M1/2DM1/2)N , and (D1/2M D1/2)N .
In all the plots, d1 = 100 nm
and d2 = 50 nm. The surface plasmon wavenumber Kp = 2.4π/d for
(M1/2DM1/2)N and Kp = 1.35π/d for (D1/2M D1/2)N and (M D)N . Since
the modes are diﬀerent for diﬀerent unit cells, the plasmon excitation
condition is diﬀerent to form the transparent band in the conﬁgurations
(M1/2DM1/2)N and (D1/2M D1/2)N . In other words, a transparent band
exists for (M1/2DM1/2)N ((d)-(f)) and (D1/2M D1/2)N ((g)-(i)) although
the surface plasmon mode (Kp, F ) is diﬀerent. In the (M D)N case, the
transparent band cannot be excited no matter what value of Kp. This is
directly related to the fact that a symmetric surface plasmon mode cannot
exist in the M D unit cell.

Figure 8: Top: transmission spectrum of a 5-period CPRW structure, i.e.
(M1/2DM1/2)5, with d1 = 120 nm and d2 = 30 nm. The plasma wavevector
Kp = 1.45π/d. The bandwidth of the transparent band is about 100 THz.
Bottom left: dispersion. The red solid lines represent the dispersions of the
transparent band (large slope) and the four resonances (small slope) in the
lower band. As a reference, the dashed blue curves show the dispersion of
the corresponding inﬁnite periodic structure. Bottom right: group velocity
Vg relative to the speed of light in vacuum c.

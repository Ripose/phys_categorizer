Abstract

The operational approach to the measurement of phase studied by Noh,

Fouger`es and Mandel is applied to the measurement of the state of polar-

ization of fully polarized light. Operational counterparts of the quantum

Stokes parameters are introduced and their ﬂuctuations are examined. It is

shown that, if the polarized ﬁeld is weak, the measured ﬂuctuations are in-

ﬂuenced not only by the quantum properties of the source ﬁeld but also that

of the measurement. This character is reﬂected on the measured probability

distributions of the parameters of polarization, which are also investigated

independently for the fully polarized coherent states and the Fock states as

the initial ﬁeld strength is varied. Finally, connection between the operational

approach to the measurement of polarization and the su(2) interferometry is

examined.

I. INTRODUCTION

The idea of the operational approach as an experimental technique based on photon count-

ing in the measurement of quantum phase ﬂuctuations has been suggested in the late 80s

by Barnett and Pegg1 in the context of a measured phase operator using certain homo-

dyne experiments and more recently was formulated in detail by Noh, Fouger´es and Mandel

(NFM)2. The operational phase measurement is based on using N-port quantum homodyne

detectors of which the analogy with classical homodyne approach is based on the purpose of

extracting information about the phase between two initial ﬁelds by performing a complete

set of photocount measurements between the components of the ﬁeld. This procedure of

obtaining the phase information between two ﬁelds depends on the particular experimen-

tal scheme through its classical analogy of relating the relative photocount measurements

to certain cosine and sine functions of the relative phase. Since, through this suggested

analogy, diﬀerent quantum measurement schemes would correspond to diﬀerent classical

ones, the information extracted for the relative phase is expected to be diﬀerent for dif-

ferent experimental schemes. Indeed this point has been demonstrated in the formulation

of the operational phase measurement by NFM by starting with two diﬀerent classical and

quantum measurement schemes where one measurement used two-port homodyne detection

whereas the second one used four-port homodyne detection2,3. The two port measurement

yields either the cosine or the sine information about the phase failing to give the full phase

information. In the four port scheme the simultaneous measurements were made possible

by well-deﬁned trigonometric operators of the relative phase where the full information on

the phase and its ﬂuctuations can be extracted. On the other hand a comparison of NFM’s

operational approach with the operational approach introduced by Vogel and Schleich4 has

been compared by Lynch5 who found agreement between the two operational schemes.

Another particularly important part of this scheme dependence manifests itself in the weak-

ﬁeld measurements in which the quantized nature of light as well as of the detectors becomes

crucial when the homodyne detectors have a relatively high probability of registering a few

2

or null photocounts within the measurement time interval T . This being the case for a

single set of measurements, one considers an ensemble of repeated measurements under the

same initial conditions. There, each repeated measurement would have generally diﬀerent

but equally acceptable conﬁgurations of detected photons and one has to make a distinction

between the outcome of a single measurement from the average outcome of a collection of

such repeated measurements under otherwise the same conditions. Despite the fact that

the experimental veriﬁcation of the operational NFM approach was successfully made by

the same group6, the appearance of the discrete outcomes in the phase measurements in
their scheme was subject to long and heavy discussions7–10. In this work we suggest another

application of their approach to the operational measurement of the state of polarization of

a fully polarized source. In an earlier publication,11 we investigated a particular extension

of NFM’s operational approach to the measurement of the Stokes parameters of a fully

polarized weak coherent light. In this work, we will extend this formalism introduced in

[11] to a more general framework by including the calculations for the measured probability

distributions of the polarization ﬂuctuations and also examine the case throughly when the

initial ﬁeld is a fully polarized Fock state.

We start with a brief outline of the operational approach to the measurement of polarization

ﬂuctuations when the polarized ﬁeld is given in a classical as well as a quantum state. In

Sec. II we present the general formalism of calculating the polarization ﬂuctuations and their

corresponding probability distributions. Sections II.A and II.B are devoted to the speciﬁc

calculations corresponding to two diﬀerent fully polarized initial quantum states of the ﬁeld

as coherent and Fock states respectively. Section II.C is devoted to the connections between

the operational approach and the su(2) interferometry.

Classically, the state of polarization of a fully polarized monochromatic ﬁeld, Ei =

ǫi cos (ω t + δi), where i = 1, 2 are the polarization indices of two preselected orthog-

onal polarization eigenmodes, can be manifestly described by four Stokes parameters

measurement of the classical Stokes parameters in Eqs (1) and their corresponding quantum

counterparts.

A. The Classical Measurement Scheme

Within the operational approach, it is possible to measure all classical Stokes parameters

in terms of the various components of the intensity. The experimental scheme is shown in

Fig. (1). The initial ﬁeld enters the setup through the %50

%50 beam splitter BS1. One

−

of the output beams of BS1 is sent to a polarizing beam splitter P BS1 which deﬁnes a

reference frame 1, 2 for the relative angular orientation of all other polarizing beam splitters.

The other arm of the beam leaving BS1 is sent to BS2 as an input, leading to the second

part of the experiment where the simultaneous measurements of cos φ and sin φ are realized

independently from the ﬁrst part. P BS2 is aligned at a 45◦ angle with respect to the

reference frame selected by P BS1. The intensities measured at the detectors D3 and D4

yield the measured values of cos φ and its moments. For the sinφ measurement, the phase

of the remaining arm of the ﬁeld is shifted by π/2 via a quarter wave-plate λ/4. The ﬁeld

is then sent to P BS3 which is aligned in parallel to P BS2. A simple calculation shows that

the classical intensities measured at all detectors Di , (i = 1, .., 6) are given by

Eqs (1) and (2) imply that the classical Stokes parameters can be extracted operationally

by measuring all ﬁeld intensities Ii

(i = 1, .., 6). In terms of these intensities, the Stokes

parameters are simply given by

s0 = (I1 + I2) ,

s1 = (I1 −

I2) ,

s2 = (I3 −

s3 = (I5 −

This particular choice of the parameters above proves to be very convenient in the quan-

tum operational measurements on fully polarized light. They also lead us naturally to the
Poincar`e’s geometric interpretation of polarization.12–15 Here θ and φ are physical parame-

ters as shown in Fig. (2). Their values are directly connected with the ellipsometry of the

polarized ﬁeld. From now on we will adopt this parameterization and study the polarization

ﬂuctuations in terms of the ﬂuctuations of these observables.

B. The Quantum Measurement Scheme

The classical description above is adequate when the ﬁeld intensity is suﬃciently high. The

vacuum ﬁelds, which are not present in the classical approach, are necessary for the correct

quantum description of the apparatus as well as the ﬁeld observables.

In Fig. (1), the ﬁeld operators ˆd1, ˆd2 at the output of P BS1 are related to the input ﬁeld

components ˆa1, ˆa2 as11

ˆd1 =

(r ˆa1 + t ˆv(1)

ˆv(1)

(j = 1, 2) are the polarized vacuum ﬁelds entering through the vacuum port of BS1.

If the measurement scheme in Fig. (1) is extended to include the photodetectors Di

(i =

3, 4, 5, 6), then φ measurements can be made compatible with a proper quantum treatment

of all ﬁelds. The output ﬁelds of P BS2 and P BS3 at D3, D4, D5, D6 are given by

ˆd3 = 1

In connection with their classical counterparts in Eqs (3), we are now at a point to suggest

the quantum Stokes parameters for the ﬁeld operators ˆdi within this operational approach
in terms of the observable photon number operators ˆni = ˆd†i

ˆdi as

ˆΣ0 = ˆn1 + ˆn2 ,

ˆΣ1 = ˆn1 −

ˆn2 ,

ˆΣ2 = ˆn3 −

ˆn4 ,

ˆΣ3 = ˆn5 −

ˆn6 .

In Eqs (6), all ﬁeld operators commute as a manifestation of the vacuum ﬁelds. Hence in

Eqs (7) we have [ ˆΣi, ˆΣj] = 0 (i

= j) and all photon number operators can be simultaneously

measured at the detectors Di (i = 1, . . . , 6). As a result, Eqs (7) are compatible with their

classical counterparts in Eqs (3). This property of the ˆΣi ,

(i = 0 . . . 3) operators allows us

to further suggest an extension Eqs (4) to their operator counterparts as

ˆCθ = ˆΣ−

3)−

1/2 ,

ˆSφ = ˆΣ3 ( ˆΣ2

2 + ˆΣ2

3)−

1/2 .

ˆCθ, ˆSθ as well as ˆCφ, ˆSφ are well-deﬁned and compatible quantum observables. They commute

with each other and satisfy the operator relations ˆC 2

θ + ˆS2

θ = 1 , ˆC 2

φ + ˆS2

φ = 1 and, as the

result, they can be measured simultaneously.

One of the beneﬁts of adopting Eqs (7) and (8) is that all measurements are now based on

pure photon counting depending on the measured photocounts at the detectors Di ,

(i =

1, . . . 6), and hence they do not involve any temporal interference eﬀects. This is an advan-

tage of the operational measurement, which will be transparent later in our discussion of

the weak-ﬁeld limit.

Eqs (8), hereinafter referred to as the operational quantum Stokes parameters (OQSP), are

the most convenient choice for ˆΣi

(i = 0, .., 3) beﬁtting the purpose of the photocount

measurement scheme of Fig. (1). All operators in (8) are now compatible with the classical

variables of Eqs (4) as long as the measurements of the ˆΣ2 and ˆΣ3 operators do not yield

zero simultaneously.

II. THE MEASUREMENT OF POLARIZATION FLUCTUATIONS IN WEAK

The operational approach as applied to the polarization measurement of a fully polarized

and weak initial ﬁeld is based on individual detections of single photons where the quantum

nature of the ﬁeld as well as of the detection mechanisms is dominant. The inﬂuence of the

FIELDS

direct quantum homodyne detection on the statistics of a quantum measurement has been

examined by Mandel16, Kelley and Kleiner17 as well as by Glauber18 and expressed for in

the form of a combined quantum probability distribution

to the photon number operator. Throughout the calculations the measurement time interval

will be assumed to be much smaller than the coherence time (which is naturally satisﬁed for

a monochromatic ﬁeld) and much larger than the inverse of the oscillation frequency of the

ﬁeld. Under these conditions it is possible to consider the simplest case when the photocount

measurement at the detectors are time translationally invariant and linearly dependent on

the measurement time interval T .

Including the quantum eﬀects of the homodyne detection in Eq. (9), an individual measure-

ment of an arbitrary ﬁeld operator f (

n1 = n2 = 0 and (n3 = n4), (n5 = n6) from the statistical weight has been introduced as

a crucial element of the operational approach2,3,6,9 in the implementation of the statistical

averages. The eﬀective weight of such conﬁgurations becomes non-negligible particularly in

the case when the initial ﬁeld strength is suﬃciently weak where the probability of receiving

zero number of photons within the detector’s measurement time interval T is ﬁnite. For

instance, the weight of observing zero photons simultaneously at the detectors D1, D2 is

given by

(0, 0)
i

hP

. The result of such a null measurement is inconclusive in the calculation of

the averages in Eq. (12). Similarly, n3 = n4 and n5 = n6 yield additional inconclusive results

in the measurement on

in Eq. (13). The measured averages are then normalized by

ˆ
Eφ(x)

i

h

excluding the total statistical weight of these inconclusive conﬁgurations from the integrated

probability. For strong ﬁelds, the weight of such ambiguous outcomes is smaller and in the

classical ﬁeld limit there is no contribution from such terms, viz.,

Nφ = 1. In the
measurement of the temporal phase the individual ﬂuctuations of these weak components as

Nθ =

well as the ﬂuctuations in the relative number of photons can be strong due to the absence of

a classical reference source (i.e. a strong local oscillator). Hence the normalization technique

introduced by NFM proves to be essential for any operational measurement based on phase

and thus also for our approach here.

The credibility of the results obtained from the quantum operational approach crucially de-

pends on the understanding of the inﬂuence of the quantum detectors on the ﬁnal statistics.

As pointed out in Refs. [2,3,6,9] that another essential element of the operational approach

is the construction of an ensemble from a long series of such single operational measure-

ments. The ﬁnal physical results are then obtained by averaging the outcomes of single

measurements over the created ensemble. Based on this prescription, we must now con-

struct a physical ensemble of measured conﬁgurations in the calculations of the moments

as well as the probability distributions in Eqs (19) and (20). The response of the quantum

detectors to the incoming photons in the creation of the photocurrent is a random process

which obeys the Poisson statistics in Eq. (9).19 As the photoelectrons are emitted at random

times respecting this statistics, the information regarding the initial temporal phase δ0 of

the incoming photons is modiﬁed and each repeated measurement is equivalent to super-

posing a random phase shift ∆ on δ0. Hence the process of repeated measurements creates

an ensemble of temporal phase conﬁgurations δ0 + ∆ with ∆ being uniformly distributed

over the available range. Since we consider in our calculations that the measurement time

interval T is considerably larger that the coherence time, the available range for ∆ is the

entire 2π range. Hence the average over the created ensemble corresponds to an averaging

over a uniform distribution of ∆. It is clear from Eq. (19) that the moments

ˆ
Eθ(x)

i

h

are

independent from δ0; hence they will also be independent of ∆. This implies that a uni-

form average over ∆ does not inﬂuence the measured moments

and the probability

On the other hand, the detectors’ inﬂuence on the measured statistics can only be understood

if the measured moments and probability distributions are compared with those without the

The θ distribution in Eq. (32) is plotted in Fig. 3 below for η = 1.0, 0.5 and

0.1, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0. The ﬁrst observation in Fig. 3(a) is that at η = 1.0 the probability distri-

bution is symmetrically centered around θ = π/2. In the weak-ﬁeld limit P (θ) is peaked at

θ = 0, π. As the ﬁeld strength is suﬃciently increased, the central peak at θ = π/2 gradually

develops as all other peaks are suppressed. The average of the cos θ within the full range

in Eq. (35). For η

= 1, the measured P (θ) is plotted in Fig.3(b). The delta functions in

Eq. (32) are numerically simulated by sharp Lorentzians, hence they acquire a ﬁnite width in

Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). On the other hand, using the equation in (21), the inferred probability

distribution P I(θ) can be found as P I(θ) = δ

which is, not surprisingly, the same distribution obtained by NFM in Ref. [6] in a slightly

diﬀerent context. The weak-ﬁeld limit of Eq. (37) has also been studied in Ref. [6] to where

we refer the reader for additional details. The numerically calculated Eq. (37) is plotted in

Fig. 4 for η = 1.0, 0.5, Σ0 = 0.1, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0 and for δ0 = 0. The ﬁrst observation we make

here is that P (φ, δ0) is almost independent from η but strongly dependent on the strength of

the initial ﬁeld. As the ﬁeld strength increases, the ﬂuctuations decrease and the distribution

becomes gradually narrower. On the other hand, using Eq. (27), the theoretically inferred

moments are calculated as

Hence, the theoretically inferred φ distribution is also non-ﬂuctuating given by P (φ, δ0) =

δ(φ

δ0). The operational averages for φ as well as the probability distributions are strongly

−

peaked in the strong-ﬁeld limit and they have the tendency to approach to the theoretically

inferred moments and the delta function-like probability distributions respectively. On the

other hand, the operational approach predicts large deviations of the measurement from

the theoretical values in the weak-ﬁeld limit. In order to understand the inﬂuence of the

photodetection particularly in the weak-ﬁeld limit, we now examine the second order ﬂuc-

tuations in the measured moments of the θ and φ related operators.

1. The measured ﬂuctuations in polarization

Once the moments in Eqs (28) and (29) are deﬁned, the measured moments of the cosine

and sine operators of θ and φ can be found. The same moments can also be found by

the use of the probability distributions in Eqs (32) and (37). Here the weak-ﬁeld limit is

particularly interesting and it can also be examined analytically. We start our analysis of

the ﬂuctuations by reminding that, since 0

θ

π, we will be conﬁned to the measured

≤
ﬂuctuations in the ˆCθ operator. In the weak-ﬁeld limit (keeping only the leading term in

≤

the total ﬁeld strength)

we ﬁnd the dispersion D(θ) as

The dependence of D(θ) for η = 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 on the total ﬁeld strength is shown in Fig. 5. We

now shift our attention to the measured ﬂuctuations in the φ distribution. Since

we need to consider here both the cosine and the sine moments. Considering ﬁrst the weak-

The dependence of D(φ) on the total ﬁeld strength is plotted for η = 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 in Fig. 6.

On the other hand, for both the θ and the φ related moments the theoretically inferred

ﬂuctuations vanish in the coherent state (i.e. D(θ)I = D(φ)I = 0). The measured ﬂuctu-

ations diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the theoretically inferred ones as the strength of the initial

ﬁeld becomes weak. These deviations in Figs.5 and 6 from the theoretically inferred values

arise from the nature of the photodetection of weak ﬁelds and the normalization of the prob-

ability weight after discarding the inconclusive data. We ﬁnd that the results for the fully

polarized coherent ﬁeld and the diﬀerences between the measured and inferred ﬂuctuations

in the weak-ﬁeld limit closely relate to the results obtained by NFM.2,6

The η dependence of the ﬂuctuations in Figs. 5 and 6 implies that η can be used as a

parameter in the measurement to search for an optimum orientation of the set-up in Fig. 1 by

rotating the reference axes 1, 2 around the initial ﬁeld direction. Note that this corresponds

to a solid rotation of the entire setup since the relative orientation of each polarizing beam

splitter with respect to P BS1 is ﬁxed. By this operation the angle between the polarization

axes of the setup and the mean principle axes of the polarization ellipse of the initial ﬁeld can

be changed. Let us suppose that α10 and α20 are initial coherent state parameters deﬁned

with respect to some ﬁxed orientation 10, 20 of P BS1 and given by αj0 =

eiδj0. If the

αj0|

|

principle axes 1, 2 are rotated by an angle γ with respect to 10, 20, the initial coherent ﬁeld

parameters α1, α2 are eﬀectively rotated by the same angle with respect to α10 and α20. In

particular, the average number of photons

measured at D1 and D2 are given

are presented in Figs. 9 and 10 for various values of M. Like in the coherent case, the

temporal phase factor φ0 in Eq (60) only shifts the distribution and does not play any role

in the ﬂuctuations. We now shift our attention to the second order ﬂuctuations in the θ and

φ dependent moments.

It is not an accident that the weak-ﬁeld limit for the coherent state described in (42) coincides

with the Fock state calculations in (64) for M = 1 for all η. The results of the numerical

calculations of D(θ) and D(φ) as the initial number of photons is varied are shown for

η = 1.0, 0.1, 0.01 in Fig. 11 for D(θ) and, Fig. 12 for D(φ) corresponding to linear polarization

The fully polarized Fock state is a typical example where the correlations are present between

the relative occupations of the polarization components. As pointed out in Ref. [2], this

renders the physical interpretation of the theoretically inferred moments for the φ-related

operators impossible.

It appears that the operational approach here provides a scheme

where the temporal phase distribution can be measured even if such correlations are present.

We believe that the results obtained in Figs. 9 and 10 should be checked experimentally

with the particular emphasis on the weak-ﬁeld regimes, which we expect to provide further

conﬁrmation of NFM’s operational scheme. The split-photon state discussed by NFM in

[2,6] can also be interpreted as the weak-ﬁeld limit of the polarized Fock state in Eq. (45)

corresponding to M = 1 where strong intensity correlations are present. For this state the

inferred moments of the corresponding ˆCφ and ˆSφ are unphysical because of the fact that

in Eq. (27) the denominator vanishes. To examine the theoretically inferred moments for

a general M we use Eqs (26) and (27) in the Fock state (45) (we consider γ = π/4 for

simplicity) to calculate

Hence, the correlation eﬀects cannot be ignored if the initial Fock state contains a few

number of photons. Furthermore, Eq. (68) implies that, for M = 1 the denominator in

Eq. (67) diverges at x = 2. It might therefore be suggested to consider that the comparison

with the theoretically inferred moments with the measured operational ones is limited to the

strong-ﬁeld regime (1

M) where also consistency with the classical results are expected

≪

to hold. On the other hand, the denominator in Eq. (67) is not well-deﬁned for values of x

not equal to an even integer. Now let us assume for the moment that we are able to replace

the denominator of Eq. (67) by (
h

ˆa†1ˆa†2ˆa1ˆa2i

)x/2. One expects that if this replacement can be

done, it can only be valid in the suﬃciently strong-ﬁeld limit where the correlations as well

as ﬂuctuations are expected to be negligible. With this replacement, Eq. (67) would yield

The inferred dispersion D(φ)I calculated from Eqs (69) is purely imaginary for all M which

is an unphysical result. Hence, the replacement we made above, in order to make the de-

nominator of Eq. (67) calculable, is unphysical for all M; thus, it cannot be done. Unlike the

coherent state, the comparison with the theoretically inferred moments is made impossible

by the presence of strong correlations. Therefore we are unable to examine the photode-

tector eﬀects in the weak-ﬁeld limit in the operational measurement of the fully polarized

Fock state using the standard formalism of theoretically inferred moments. The unphysical

results we obtained for the inferred moments are not inherent to the quantum scheme. Even

in the classical measurement scheme, there is no unique way of extracting the theoretically

inferred moments when the relative phase or the relative intensity ﬂuctuations are corre-

lated. We refer the reader to Ref. [2] for a detailed discussion on this topic in the context

of operational phase formalism. Nevertheless, we will suggest in the following subsection

that for the Fock state in Eq. (50), or speciﬁcally for Eq. (45), it is possible to ﬁnd another

measure to examine the photodetector eﬀects in the weak-ﬁeld limit by making use of the

properties of the uncertainty relations.

The fully polarized Fock state is nothing but the generalized coherent state of the free ﬁeld

su(2) angular momentum algebra. Under certain conditions Eq (70) also coincides with the
su(2) minimum uncertainty states21–23 minimizing Eq.(73); and, this fact has been recently
explored in the current literature in the context of su(2) interferometry.22–24

25

The idea of su(2) interferometry is to create interference between two arbitrary input ﬁelds

by using passive and active lossless optical devices to measure the relative temporal phase

between the ﬁelds. For this purpose the measured operators of the su(2) interferometry

are deﬁned as in Eqs (72) or they are related to Eqs (72) by certain unitary transformations

induced by the passive and active optical devices. These transformations on Eqs (72) [or

the inverse transformations on the initial ﬁelds] can be engineered in such a way that the

relative phase shift between the input ﬁelds can be measured by pure intensity measurements

on the ﬁelds at the output ports of the interferometer.22 The principles of the quantum

interferometry are thus based on a generalized operational scheme that is, in principle, very

similar to the idea of the operational phase measurement presented in [2,3,6,9] as well as the

present work.

Now let us construct the uncertainty product for the general fully polarized Fock state

M

iφ0,γ and particularly focus our attention on the speciﬁc limit

iφ0 at γ = π/4. The

measured interferometric operators correspond, in the standard su(2) interferometry, to the

Using γ = π/4 in Eqs. (75) and (74) we observe that

iφ0 is an important state in the
algebra deﬁned by the operators in Eq. (72). It is an su(2) coherent state [see Eq. (70)] as

well as a minimum uncertainty (intelligent) state minimizing Eq. (73) for i

= j = 1, 3; k = 2

and i

= j = 1, 2; k = 3. This can be explicitly seen by using Eqs. (74) and (75) in Eq. (73).

Furthermore, when γ = π/4, this result is independent from φ0; hence, a temporal shift

in φ0 does not change any of these properties. This implies that, if su(2)-interferometric

techniques22 are employed for

iφ0, the standard precision can be achieved in the mea-
surement of the temporal phase.23,24 The precision in the phase measurement can be found

M

≥

Hence, theoretically, the maximum precision in the phase measurement can be achieved only

at γ(π/4) = 1 corresponding to η = 1. The basic idea being the extraction of the phase

statistics from pure photon counting, the su(2) interferometry is in a close analogy to the

operational measurement scheme. The operators ˆJi ,

(i = 0, 1, 2, 3) are the interferometric

analogs of the operational ones ˆΣi ,

(i = 0, 1, 2, 3) in Eq. (7), but there are also signiﬁcant

diﬀerences between them. Although the ˆJi’s are the generators of the su(2) algebra, the

ˆΣi’s all commute with each other and no useful uncertainty product similar to Eq. (73) can

quantum state

be written for them. Now a legitimate question arises on how much the properties of the
iφ0,γ , as far as the ˆJi’s are concerned, are preserved in the operational
measurement scheme using the ˆΣi operators. The main diﬀerence arising from the presence

M

|

of the vacuum states in the ˆΣi’s as well as the operational scheme itself, it is nevertheless

expected that for suﬃciently strong ﬁelds the quantum operational measurement using the

ˆΣi operators should be consistent with Eq. (73). The deviations in the quantum operational

measurement scheme from Eq. (73) are expected when the initial ﬁeld is suﬃciently weak.

Hence, by examining the uncertainty properties of

iφ0,γ, particularly near γ = π/4, a per-
fect ground to understand the inﬂuence of the operational scheme in the ﬁnal measurement

M

|

can be provided.

We start the analysis of the uncertainty relations for

M

iφ0,γ by examining the γ dependence

of the measured D(θ) and D(φ). The results are represented in Fig. 13 for M = 1, 5 and

for linear polarization in the range 0

γ

π/2. The ﬁgure indicates that, similarly to

≤
the results obtained for the fully polarized coherent state measurements, it is not possible

≤

to simultaneously minimize the ﬂuctuations in the measurements of the θ and φ related

moments. The values of D(θ) and D(φ) in Fig. 13 corresponding to γ = π/4 (i.e., η = 1),

γ

0.3π (i.e., η = 0.5), γ

0.4π (i.e., η = 0.1), and γ

0.47π (i.e., η = 0.01) can also

≃

≃

≃

be read from the Figs. 11 and 12. Here γ = π/4 has a special importance since this point

corresponds to where

iφ0,γ becomes a coherent as well as a minimum uncertainty state
of the ˆJi’s. As γ is shifted away from π/4, particularly towards γ = 0, π/2, one particular

M

|

polarization mode starts dominating where the initial state gradually starts looking like a

single mode Fock state. The single mode Fock limit is realized at γ = 0, π/2 for θ related

measurements [i.e., D(θ) = 0 and P (θ) comprises a single delta function peak], and a

maximally random ﬂuctuations are observed in the φ related measurements [i.e., D(φ) = 1

and P (φ) = 1/2π]. Because of the fact that the interferometric operators do not commute

with each other, it is not possible to ﬁnd the interferometric analogs of the trigonometric

operators ˆCθ, ˆSθ and ˆCφ, ˆSφ deﬁned in Eqs. (8). This implies that, the interferometric analogs

of D(θ) and D(φ) cannot be found by direct analogy and a comparison between the theory

and the measurement is not possible for them. At this level, the only comparison with the

theory can be made by examining the minimum uncertainty product for the ˆJi’s and the

ˆΣi’s.

Keeping γ as the parameter, we now express Eq. (73) in

M

iφ0,γ in the form

with the minimum uncertainty corresponding to

In comparing Eq. (79) with Eq. (77) the diﬀerences arising from the diﬀerent normalizing

factors of the transmission and the reﬂection coeﬃcients in the ˆdi’s in Eq. (5) should also

be accounted for. The result of the numerical calculations for

(γ) is presented in

Uop(γ)/

U

Fig. 14 as a function of M. We also observed that Eq. (79) has no φ0 dependence for all M

and γ [not shown in Fig. 14] which is consistent with the theoretical calculation in Eq. (78).

The Fig. 14 indicates that the photodetection in the operational scheme unavoidably creates

an additional noise in the measurement such that the theoretical value of the uncertainty

is not reached until the initial state has suﬃciently large (i.e. 5 <
∼

M) number of photons.

Here, as γ varies, there is a compromise between the value of the measured uncertainty

product for large M and the detector noise for small M. For instance, at γ = π/4 (i.e.,

η = 1), the measured uncertainty product approaches the theoretical minimum uncertainty

for large M, although the detector noise is as large as 100% at the small M limit. On the

other hand, as γ deviates from π/4, the measured uncertainty product is no more at the

minimum for large M but the detector noise is smaller for small M. Hence, it appears that

there is no global optimum value for γ. We thus conclude that γ can be optimally ﬁxed only

depending on the individual observables chosen in the measurement (i.e., a result which we

have also reached in the fully polarized coherent state example in Sec. II.A.1).

In the theoretical interferometric calculations it is a common practice to neglect the inﬂuence

of the photodetection. This is certainly a valid assumption if the initial ﬁeld is suﬃciently

strong. On the other hand, we expect the additional higher bound on the uncertainty product

to be a manifestation of any scheme based on photon counting in the weak-ﬁeld limit arising

from the quantum nature of the photodetection. Hence it is also natural to expect these

eﬀects to be observable in the su(2) interferometric measurements. This result indeed needs

experimental veriﬁcation, particularly, considering the advantage that certain schemes have

been proposed for the generation of such quantum states as Eq. (45) experimentally using

29

active non-linear processes.25

In this work, we focused our attention on the operational measurement scheme as applied

to certain fully polarized quantum states particularly in the weak-ﬁeld regime. We have

shown that, similarly to NFM’s operational phase measurement scheme it is possible to

base the measurement of the state of polarization on pure photocount measurements, hence

providing another example for operational approach.

In particular, the measurement of

the ﬂuctuations of the temporal phase between the polarized ﬁeld components is, not sur-

prisingly, identical to the original work by NFM. The statistical behaviour of the Stokes

parameters is investigated in terms of the trigonometric operators in Eqs. (8) and the oper-

ational counterparts of the quantum Stokes parameters of the polarized ﬁeld are introduced

in Eqs. (7). The application of the operational polarization measurement scheme is made

to fully polarized quantum coherent as well as Fock states. With the purpose of extract-

ing the detectors’ inﬂuence on the measurement, the statistics of the measured ﬂuctuations

are examined and compared with the theoretical calculations. Our results conﬁrm those of

NFM’s operational phase measurement scheme to conclude that the photon-counting pro-

cess introduces additional noise in the ﬁnal statistics particularly in the weak-ﬁeld regimes.

For suﬃciently strong ﬁelds, the operational measurement scheme is consistent with those

theoretical predictions in which the photo-detection eﬀects are not included.

The connection between the operational approach to the measurement of polarization and

the su(2) interferometry is examined and the uncertainty principle is used as a means of

analyzing the photodetection eﬀects in the measurement where applications are made on

the fully polarized Fock state.

Operational approach to the measurement of phase has been investigated by D’Ariano and

Paris26 in the context of quantum estimation theory27 which provides a uniﬁed formulation

of the measurement process and the initial system under investigation. The quantum prob-

30

ability distribution of the N-port homodyne detection in Eq. (9) is a speciﬁc example of the

probability-operator-valued measure (POM) in the quantum estimation theory. An ideal

quantum measurement is realized when the POM is based on an orthogonal and complete

set of states comprising the eigenspace of the measured observable. Hence, depending on

the nature of the measured observables of the initial state, ﬁnding an optimum detection

scheme is the primary goal of a uniﬁed formulation of the measurement and the initial sys-

tem. For the measured observable being phase related quantities, such an approach has not

been idealized yet because of the fact that an orthogonal POM cannot be physically realized

for the phase observable. With this in mind, one resorts to optimizing the phase measure-

ment by a proper choice of the initial states as well as the parameters of the measuring

system. At this point a connection is present between the primary goal of the quantum

estimation theory and the attempts to surpass the standard noise limit by using interfero-

metric transformations on the measuring system (or inverse transformations on the initial

state). The optimal choice of these transformations using active as well as passive optical

devices naturally depends on the initial state. Furthermore, it is also desirable (and under

certain conditions it is strictly required) to have the transformed state conserve the basic

features of the original state i.e., full polarization, coherent and minimum uncertainty state

for Eq. (45), the statistics of the ﬂuctuations, etc. It is natural that for the initial state be-

ing fully polarized, the full polarization itself is a strict condition that should be conserved

by the transformations. On the other hand, since

iφ0 is a minimum uncertainty state,
the quantum statistics of the temporal phase φ and the ﬂuctuations in corresponding φ de-

M

|

pendent operators are coupled with those describing the ﬂuctuations in the relative photon

ˆn2. Hence, the minimum uncertainty condition of

number ˆn1 −
iφ0 will most certainly be
at stake after such transformations and this will change the quantum nature of the state [for

M

|

instance, a rotation in the ﬁeld space by γ does not change the full polarization property

but changes the minimum uncertainty relations, as it can be seen from Eq. (73) and (78)].

For those states which are not the minimum uncertainty ones, this observation is still valid

to a lesser extent. We nevertheless conclude that attempts to surpass the standard noise

31

limit for the fully polarized quantum states have to comply with a number of restrictions,

which certainly renders it to be rather interesting problem.

10 Here the author believes that one should make a clear distinction between two diﬀerent

major perspectives dominating the ﬁeld of quantum phase research. The ﬁrst perspective

is to consider the quantum phase as a property of the quantum mechanics within a gener-

alized quantum phase space formalism. This was the original stand taken by Dirac in his

search for a correspondence between the classical canonical variables in the action-angle

phase space and their quantum counterparts. [see P.A.M. Dirac, Proc. R. Soc. London A

114 243 (1927); and also P.A.M. Dirac, Principles of Quantum Mechanics (Oxford Univ.

Press, London 1958)]. The theoretical search for the quantum phase operator continued

after Dirac. Heitler [W. Heitler, The Quantum Theory of Radiation (Academic Press,

London 1954)] used Dirac’s formulation in the quantization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

Perhaps, Heitler’s work somewhat made a landmark in the search for quantum phase in the

context of the quantum properties of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and quantum phase became

dominantly a research topic of quantum optics. The introduction of the photon coherent

states by Glauber [R.J. Glauber, Phys. Rev. 130 2529 (1963); R.J. Glauber, Phys. Rev.

33

131 2766 (1963)] and the developments in the laser physics in the 60s enhanced the role

of quantum optics in the quantum phase research. A recourse was taken by Carruthers

and Nieto in their seminal work [P. Carruthers and M.M. Nieto, Rev. Mod. Phys. 40,

411 (1968)], which they wisely entitled as Phase and Angle Variables in Quantum Me-

chanics, where a revival of the canonical phase space perspective of the quantum phase

problem was initiated. This line of canonical approach has been dominantly furthered -the

author apologizes for the reason of not being able to include a complete list of important

theoretical and experimental works in this short note- by the works of Rocca and Siruge

[F. Rocca and M. Siruge, Comm. Math. Phys. 34, 111 (1973)]; Moshinsky and Seligman

[M. Moshinsky and T.H. Seligman, Ann. Phys. (N.Y.) 114, 243 (1978); J. Phys. A 12,

L135 (1979)], and Newton [R.G. Newton, Ann. Phys. (N.Y.) 124, 327 (1980)]. In 1989

Pegg and Barnett introduced the most popular phase operator formalism [D.T. Pegg and

S.M. Barnett, Phys. Rev. A, 1665 (1989)] based on a mathematical abstraction of the

concept of truncated Hilbert spaces where they were able to deﬁne a Hermitian operator

corresponding to quantum phase. Although the Pegg-Barnett formalism is practical from

the calculational point of view it is not algebraic because of the arbitrary introduction of a

truncation in the Hilbert space. On the opposite side, Moshinsky and Seligman’s work has

been recently followed by Luis and S´anchez-Soto [A. Luis and L.L. Sanchez-Soto, Phys.

Rev. A 47, 1492 (1993); A. Luis and L.L. S´anchez-Soto, Phys. Rev. A 48, 752 (1993)] to

ﬁnd a canonical path to the phase problem. More recently an algebraic canonical approach

based on the generalized quantum phase space formalism was introduced by the author

of this article [T. Hakio˘glu, J. Phys. A 31, 6975 (1998); T. Hakio˘glu, J. Phys. A 31, 707

(1998)].

The second perspective is to understand the properties of the quantum phase by develop-

ing a theory of phase measurement. There has been a substantial literature on diﬀerent

classical and quantum measurement schemes allowing to extract the measured proper-

ties of the phase. These schemes were mostly inherited from the recent developments in

34

quantum optics, thus conﬁning to the phase properties of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. In

this mainstream, some important works are -in addition to the other references of this

article- by Vogel and Schleich [W. Vogel and W. Schleich, Phys. Rev. A 44, 7642 (1991)]

and Freyberger et al. [M. Freyberger, K. Vogel and W.P. Schleich, Phys. Lett. A 176, 41

(1993)] where they introduced the quantum phase space sampling by quadrature rotations

which was carried on successfully both in the experimental and theoretical directions by

Smithey et al. [D.T. Smithey ,M. Beck, M.G. Raymer and A. Faridani, Phys. Rev. Lett.

70, 1244 (1993); D.T. Smithey, M. Beck, J. Cooper and M.G. Raymer, Phys. Rev. A 48,

3159 (1993)]; and D’Ariano et al. [M.G. D’Ariano, C. Macchiavello and M.G.A. Paris,

Phys. Rev. A50, 4298 (1994); for a complete list see M.G. D’Ariano, Measuring Quantum

States, in Quantum Optics and the Spectroscopy of Solids: Concepts and Advances, Ed.

T. Hakio˘glu and A.S. Shumovsky (Kluwer Acad. Publ. 1997)]. Recently an interesting

approach to the radiation phase was also made by A. Shumovsky, Optics Comm. 136, 219

(1997); A. Shumovsky and ¨Ozg¨ur M¨ustecaplıo˘glu, Optics Comm. 146, 124 (1998)].

An impressive overview, from the quantum optics point of view, of the major historical

developments in the 70 year-old theoretical and experimental search for the properties of

the quantum phase and a substantial list of references are available in the recent books

by Werner Vogel and Dirk-Gunnar Welsch Quantum Optics (Akademia Verlag, Berlin

1994); and L. Mandel and E. Wolf, Optical Coherence and Quantum Optics, (Cambridge

University Press 1995).

It must be stressed that these two distinct perspectives are not mutually exclusive but

rather they should be considered,in authors view, as generating complementary informa-

tion on the properties of quantum phase.

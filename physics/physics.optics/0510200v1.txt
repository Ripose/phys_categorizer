The interaction of a ﬁve-level atomic system involving electromagnetically induced transparency
with four light ﬁelds is investigated. Two diﬀerent light-atom conﬁgurations are considered, and
their eﬃciency in generating large nonlinear cross-phase shifts compared. The dispersive properties
of those schemes are analyzed in detail, and the conditions leading to group velocity matching for
two of the light ﬁelds are identiﬁed. An analytical treatment based on amplitude equations is used
in order to obtain approximate solutions for the susceptibilities, which are shown to ﬁt well with
the numerical solution of the full Bloch equations in a large parameter region.

An eﬃcient cross-phase modulation (XPM) in quan-
tum and semiclassical regimes is both interesting and
useful in many possible applications, such as those in
optical communications [1], optical Kerr shutters [2],
quantum non-demolition measurements [3] and quantum
phase gates [4]. In all of these, but the last two especially,
a large XPM is desirable for low pump powers and high
sensitivities.

In a standard three-level cascade scheme, shown in
Fig. 1b, nonlinear eﬀects are obtained alongside absorp-
tion, which increase as the ﬁelds are tuned closer to the
atomic transition [5]. To reduce the absorption to an ac-
ceptable level, light ﬁelds need to be strongly detuned
from the intermediate atomic level
, simultaneously
i
reducing however the size of the nonlinearity, since both
are inversely proportional to the square of the detuning.

Extensive studies aimed at avoiding this problem have
been performed in recent years. A promising candidate
emerged with the use of quantum coherence eﬀects in
the interaction of light with multilevel atoms. Coherent
population trapping (CPT) [6] and in particular the re-
lated eﬀect of electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) [7, 8] have been studied theoretically [5, 9, 10]
and experimentally [3, 11, 12, 13] in various energy-level
schemes based on a generic Λ-scheme (see Fig. 1a). At
resonance (δ1 = 0 in Fig. 1a), the presence of the cou-
pling ﬁeld (with Rabi frequency Ω2) cancels, by destruc-
tive interference, the absorption on the probe transition
(with Rabi frequency Ω1), and renders the medium trans-
parent for the probe beam. A more general condition for
EIT is two-photon resonance, a condition that is satisﬁed
when the frequency diﬀerence between the ﬁelds matches
the energy gap between levels
. However, on
i
the exact EIT resonance, probe ﬁeld decouples from the
atoms, making the dynamics purely linear.

FIG. 1:
(a) Three-level Λ–scheme for EIT. Transitions are
driven by the probe and coupling ﬁelds, with Rabi frequency
Ω1 and Ω2 respectively. When the probe detuning δ1 matches
the two photon Raman-resonance condition with the coupling
ﬁeld, the atomic medium becomes transparent for the probe
ﬁeld. (b) Three-level cascade conﬁguration. To obtain signif-
icant nonlinear eﬀects for the probe ﬁeld with Rabi frequency

ular system in the presence of EIT, usually arise by one
of the two following related mechanisms. One is to vi-
olate the strict two-photon resonance condition, with
a frequency mismatch smaller than the width of the
transparency window [3, 14, 15]. Alternatively, one can
add additional energy level(s) in order to induce an ac-
Stark shift and eﬀectively tune the signal out of reso-
nance [5, 10, 16]. Both mechanisms result in large nonlin-
earities, accompanied by very weak absorption. Recently,
the so-called M -scheme, shown in Fig. 2, has been studied
and proposed as a promising source of giant nonlineari-
ties that can be utilized for XPM [14, 17]. The double Λ
nature of this M conﬁguration oﬀers the opportunity of
a simultaneous group velocity reduction for pulses prop-
agating inside the atomic sample. Group velocity match-
ing, originally pointed out by Lukin and Imamo˘glu [18],
is important to obtain a large XPM. In fact, it has been
shown by Harris and Hau [10] that if equal group velocity
reduction is not achieved for both ﬁelds, the nonlinear
phase accumulation will saturate at a certain constant
value. The consequence is that increasing the length of

the sample in which the nonlinear interaction takes place
is not useful. On the other hand, if group velocities are
equal, the nonlinear phase accumulation becomes linear
in the interaction length [18] and it may become very
large.

A large cross Kerr phase shift is very useful
for
photonic-based implementations of quantum information
(QI) processing systems [4, 19]. In fact, a fundamental
building block for quantum information processing is the
quantum phase gate (QPG). In a QPG, one qubit gets
a phase conditional to the other qubit state according to
i
the transformation [4, 20]

is nonzero, and it is equivalent to a CNOT gate up to
local unitary transformations when φ = π [4, 20].

To obtain a CPS of φ = π, one looks for a strong in-
teraction between qubits, ideally accompanied by weak
decoherence. Photons are a particularly attractive choice
for qubits due to their robustness against decoherence
during the processing and transmission of information.
This feature should ideally permit the transmission of the
quantum information stored in very weak quantum pulses
over very long distances with a negligibly small reduction
of the initial signal. There is however an important dif-
ﬁculty in the implementation of an all–optical–QPG: to
process the information one needs strong photon–photon
interaction.
In fact, to implement QI with photons, a
nonlinear interaction is needed either to build a two-
photon gate operation [14, 15, 21, 22] or at the detec-
tion stage in linear optics quantum computation [23]. It
should also be mentioned that the generation of single-
photons (which is also necessary in linear optics quantum
computation) also relies on nonlinear interactions.

In this paper we perform a semiclassical analysis of
the interaction of light with atoms in the M conﬁgura-
tion, in which the amplitude of the four ﬁelds involved is
described in terms of the corresponding Rabi frequency.
The aim is to estimate the eﬀects of noise sources, such
as dephasing and spontaneous emission, both on the non-
linear interaction and on group velocity matching. The
semiclassical regime oﬀers a clear picture of the physical
aspects involved in EIT-based nonlinear optics, and well
describes a number of recent experiments [13, 24]. To
this end we consider two diﬀerent conﬁgurations of atom-
ﬁeld interactions, which we will call the asymmetric (see
Fig. 2) and the symmetric (see Fig. 8) M scheme. The
paper is thus composed of two main parts.
In Sec. II
we describe the physics of the asymmetric M -scheme.
We start by deﬁning the system and calculating the sus-
ceptibilities using an approximate treatment employing
amplitude equations. These analytical calculations are
then compared with the results of the numerical solution
of the full system of Bloch equations. Finally, the condi-
tions for group velocity matching are analyzed. In Sec. III

2

the physics of the symmetric M -scheme is described by
following the same order as in Sec. II. Conclusions are
drawn in Sec. IV.

II. THE ASYMMETRIC M SCHEME

A. The System

The M -system under consideration has a double adja-
cent Λ structure as shown in Fig. 2, where atoms with ﬁve
levels (three ground states
, and two excited
1
,

|
i
states
) interact with four electromagnetic ﬁelds.
i
This conﬁguration can be realized in Zeeman-splitted al-
kali atoms, such as 87Rb atoms. The Rabi frequencies
associated with the lasers driving the atomic transitions
are deﬁned as

respectively. On the transition

|
a trigger ﬁeld (with Ω3) is applied.
In this paper, we
will analyze the XPM and the group velocity matching
between the probe and the trigger ﬁelds. We call the
scheme of Fig. 2 the asymmetric M scheme due to the
asymmetric distribution of the initial atomic population.
All the atoms are in fact assumed to be initially in state
so that they directly feel the eﬀect of the probe ﬁeld

|
only, while the eﬀect of the trigger ﬁeld is only indirect.
Due to this inherent asymmetry, the dynamics experi-
enced by probe and trigger ﬁelds are always diﬀerent,
even when the corresponding parameters (Rabi frequen-
cies, decay rates, detunings) are equal. The symmetric
version of this scheme will be analyzed in Sec. III.

B. Amplitude variables approach

We now study the dynamics driven by Eq. (7). How-
ever, we have to include the eﬀects of spontaneous emis-
sion and dephasing, and we ﬁrst treat them in a phe-
nomenological manner by including decay rates ΓAV
for
each atomic level
in the equations for the amplitude
variables (AV) of the atomic wave-function. From an in-
4
tuitive point of view, for the excited levels
i
|
these rates describe the total spontaneous decay rates,
while for the ground states the associated decay rates de-
scribe dephasing processes [8]. Therefore, the evolution

The system’s initial state is assumed to be the ground
. Since an eﬃcient XPM requires a dispersive in-
state
i
teraction, we tailor the dynamics in such a way that this
initial condition on the populations remains essentially
unaltered, even when the system reaches the steady-
state, i.e.,

To this end we assume that the control ﬁeld Ω2 is stronger
then the probe ﬁeld Ω1, with the system being approxi-
mately on Raman resonance for the ﬁrst and the second

where N is the number of atoms interacting with the elec-

and ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant. Doppler broad-

Doppler eﬀect can be cancelled by using co-propagating

quence of the asymmetry of the population distribution,
which essentially remains in the ground state
all the
time. This means that the trigger ﬁeld drives a virtually
empty transition, hence the contribution to the suscepti-
bility comes only from higher order (see [15] for discus-
sion on the link between the population distribution and
a linear contribution to susceptibility). It will be shown
in Sec. III that the symmetric M -scheme brings about
both a linear and a self-Kerr contribution to the trigger
susceptibility.

We shall see in the next subsection that these approxi-
mate expressions for the nonlinear susceptibilities ﬁt very
well with the numerical solution of the exact dynamics

of the system.

The asymmetric M -scheme can be seen as an extension
of the four level N -scheme introduced in Ref. [5], with the

5
|

addition of the coupling to an additional level
pro-
vided by the tuner ﬁeld with Rabi frequency Ω4. In fact,
it easy to check that upon setting Ω4 = 0 in Eq. (17b),
one recovers the third-order nonlinear susceptibility of
the four-level N -scheme derived in Refs. [5, 13]). As we
will see below, the role of the tuner ﬁeld is to enable a ﬁne
tuning of the group velocities, in order to achieve group
velocity matching between probe and trigger [14, 16, 18].

C. Comparison with the Optical Bloch Equations

We now study the dynamics of the asymmetric M
scheme of Fig. 2 by means of the optical Bloch equa-

5

tions (OBE), which allow to describe spontaneous emis-
sion and dephasing rigorously and no more phenomeno-
logically as in the AV treatment presented in the preced-
ing subsection. We consider six spontaneous decay chan-
nels, i.e., the decay of the excited state
onto the three
2
i
|
ground state sublevels
with rates Γ21,
5
3
i
|
|
Γ23 and Γ25 respectively, and the corresponding decay of
the excited state
, and
i
with rates Γ41, Γ43 and Γ45 respectively. Moreover
5
|
we consider dephasing of the each level
with dephas-
ing rate γii, so that the master equation for the atomic
density operator ρ is given by

onto the three sublevels

, and

and the composite dephasing rates

γij = γii + γjj ,

i = 1 . . . 5.

(22)

The OBE for the M scheme are quite involved and less
suited for an approximate analytical treatment with re-
spect to the AV equations of the preceding subsection.
In fact, if we consider again the condition
1
and, consistently with Eq. (10), we assume that

at the steady state, it is possible to see that by insert-
ing Eqs. (23) into Eqs. (A2) for the coherences, one gets
a satisfactory expression for the probe linear suscepti-
bility only. To be more speciﬁc, only the approximate
linear susceptibility ﬁts well with the numerical solution
of the OBE, while it turns out to be extremely diﬃcult
to derive analytical expressions from Eqs. (A1) and (A2)
for the nonlinear susceptibilities, as simple as those of
Eqs. (17), and which reproduce in the same way the ex-
act numerical solution in the EIT regime we are studying.
Obviously, one can exactly solve analytically the OBE,
but the resulting expressions are very cumbersome and
not physically transparent such as those of Eqs. (17). For

this reason we will analytically derive from the OBE the
probe linear susceptibility only, and we will then use the
OBE only for the numerical determination of the atomic
steady state. Additionally, deriving this result will en-
able us to draw a formal analogy between the AV and
OBE treatments (see Eqs. (26) below).

The probe susceptibility is deﬁned in terms of the

atomic coherence σ12 as (see also Eq. (14a))

χP =

σ12 =

σ12.

(24)

Using Eqs. (23) and performing a series expansion at the
lowest order in the probe and trigger ﬁelds, we arrive
at an approximate solution for σ12, which, inserted into
Eq. (24), gives the following expression for the probe lin-
ear susceptibility

By comparing Eq. (25) with Eq. (16), one can imme-
diately see that the AV and OBE predictions for the
probe linear susceptibility coincide provided that the
phenomenological decay rates ΓAV
are appropriately in-
terpreted, i.e.,

− |

i

ΓAV
ΓAV

2 ↔
3 ↔

Γ2 + γ12,
γ13.

(26a)
(26b)

This comparison shows therefore that the AV approach
provides a treatment of the atomic dynamics simpler
than the OBE’s approach, but roughly equivalent, and
that the intuitive interpretation of its phenomenologi-
cal decay rates ΓAV
as spontaneous emission total decay

i

rates for the excited states, and as dephasing rates in the
case of ground state sublevels, is essentially correct, es-
pecially in the typical case in which dephasing rates are
much smaller than spontaneous emission decay rates (see
Eqs. (26)).

We then consider the numerical solution of the OBE
and we compare it with the analytical treatment based
on the AV approach presented above. The numerical
calculations are performed in the range of parameters
corresponding to EIT, i.e.,
and we
,
Ω1|
|
stay near two-photon resonance for both the probe and
the trigger ﬁeld. In Figs. 3-6 we compare the analytical
solutions of Eq. (16) and Eqs. (17) with the numerical
solution of the complete set of Bloch equations given in
the Appendix A. From these plots it is evident that our
analytical treatment works satisfactorily well, except for
a small interval of values of the detuning, corresponding
to the maximum probe (or trigger) absorption. In such
a case, the detunings match the Rabi frequencies of the
two pumps, and the probe (or trigger) ﬁeld is in reso-
nance with a single atomic transition. The atoms are
signiﬁcantly pumped to the excited levels and the pop-
ulation assumption of Eq. (10) is not fulﬁlled. In fact,
the discrepancy between the exact numerical solution of
the OBE and the AV approach is strictly related to the
atomic population out of level
which, in the case of
Fig. 3, is about 14% of the total population.

∀
typical for not too dense gases. For larger values of the
dephasing rates (some tens of kHz), we have seen that the
analytical prediction of the AV approach of the preceding
subsection starts to depart from the exact solution of the
OBE.

where l is the length of the atomic medium. These non-
linear cross-phase shifts are of fundamental importance
also for quantum information processing applications. In
fact, the CPS of Eq. (1) is determined only by these cross-
Kerr contributions to the total phase shift, because the
linear and self-Kerr contributions cancel out, as shown in
Refs. [14, 15].

For Gaussian probe and trigger pulses of time dura-
tions τP and τT , and with peak Rabi frequencies Ωpeak
and Ωpeak
respectively, the nonlinear cross-phase shifts
can be written as (see also Refs. [14, 15])

become equal, i.e., when ζP,T →
0, in which case the
erf[ζ]/ζ reaches the maximum value 2/√π. In this limit
the cross-phase phase shifts linearly increase with the
length of the atomic medium l. This explains why achiev-
ing group velocity matching, vP
g , is of fundamental
importance. Moreover group velocities become small for
large group indices and this condition can be achieved
within the EIT transparency window, where Re[χ] van-
ishes, and the group velocity is strongly reduced due to
a large dispersion gradient ∂Re[χ]/∂ω.

Let us see how small and equal probe and trigger group
velocities can be obtained. We consider the approximate
analytical expressions for the susceptibilities of Eqs. (15)-
(17) derived above within the AV approach, and which
we have seen to work very well in the EIT regime. As-
suming to stay at the center of the transparency window
for the probe (δ12 = 0) where the dispersion gradient
is maximum, and neglecting dephasing rates ΓAV

ΓAV

As expected, the asymmetric M -scheme does not yield
equal slow down of both trigger and probe pulse automat-
ically as, for example, the scheme of Petrosyan and Kur-
izki [16] does. In fact, the two expressions of the group
velocities are generally diﬀerent. Nonetheless, Eqs. (34)
show that group velocity matching is always achievable
by properly adjusting the parameter β, which means ad-
2 and the composite de-
justing the tuner intensity

tuning δ14. This shows that the present asymmetric M -
scheme can be seen as a modiﬁed version of the N -scheme
of Ref. [5], in which the tuner pump ﬁeld is added just
in order to “tune” the group velocity of the trigger pulse
so to make it equal to that of the probe. The possibility
to achieve group velocity matching is shown in Fig. 7,

III. THE SYMMETRIC M–SCHEME

3
|

In this section we analyze the symmetric M–scheme,
schematically shown in Fig. 8. The initial conditions and
the conﬁguration of the ﬁelds are slightly diﬀerent from
those of the asymmetric case of Sec. II. The same ﬁve
levels could be used, but all the atoms are now initially
(see Fig. 8). Moreover, the role of
prepared in level
the probe and of the coupler ﬁelds are exchanged, i.e.,
now the probe ﬁeld (still with Rabi frequency Ω1 and
central frequency ω1) couples levels
, while
i
the coupler (still with Rabi frequency Ω2 and central fre-
.
quency ω2) induces transitions between levels
i
The role of trigger and tuner ﬁelds remains unchanged.
In such a way, the scheme becomes symmetric for probe
and trigger, and the two ﬁelds experience exactly the

and

and

analytical predictions of Eqs. (34) (the thick line refers to
the probe and the thin line to the trigger). Circles and dots
refer to the numerical solution of the OBE for the probe and
trigger group velocity, respectively. This ﬁgure shows how it is
possible to obtain group velocity matching in the asymmetric
M -scheme: two diﬀerent values of δ3 exist for which vP
g =
vT
g ≃ 1000 m/s. The parameters are those of the D1 and D2
line in the 87Rb spectrum: ΓAV
4 =
Γ4 ≃ 38 MHz, δ1 = δ2 = 0, δ4 ≃ δ3 ≃ 20Γ4, Ω1 = 0.08Γ4,
Ω2 = 2Γ4, Ω3 = 0.04Γ4, Ω4 = Γ4, ∀ i,j, γij = ΓAV

same dynamics whenever the corresponding parameters
are made equal, i.e., when the Rabi frequencies are cor-
respondingly equal (Ω1 = Ω3, Ω2 = Ω4), as well as the
detunings, (δ1 = δ3, δ2 = δ4), which are now deﬁned sim-
ilarly to those of the asymmetric M scheme (see Eqs. (3))
except for probe-coupler exchange, i.e.,

E5 = ¯hω4 + ¯hδ4.

In this way, the scheme can be seen again as formed
by two adjacent Λ, one for the probe and one for the
trigger, now however symmetrically placed with respect
. As we have done for the asymmetric M
to state
i
scheme, we assume to stay close to the two-photon res-
δ4, and more-
onance conditions, δ1 ≃
over that
, so that both
probe and trigger will experience EIT. As we have seen
above, a large XPM is obtained when the group velocities
are equal [10, 14, 15, 16, 18, 22], and the advantage of
the present symmetric M–scheme is that group velocity
matching is automatically achieved once that the scheme
is exactly symmetric between probe and trigger.

A. Amplitude Variables Approach

We ﬁrst study the system dynamics by means of the
AV approach, in which the state of the atom is described
by the wave-function of Eq. (8), whose time evolution
is determined by the Hamiltonian of Eq. (39), supple-
mented with phenomenological decay rates ΓAV

The set of equations (40) is then solved in the steady-
state.
In order to get a consistent expression for the
nonlinear susceptibilities one has to consider higher order
contributions to Eq. (42), which is obtained by imposing
the normalization of the atomic wave-function of Eq. (8)
at second order in
. One gets the

First of all we note that the expressions of the probe
and trigger susceptibilities above are completely sym-
metric. This means that probe and trigger experience
the same linear and Kerr susceptibilities, as soon as the
corresponding parameters correspond, i.e., µ32 = µ34,
1 = ΓAV
Ω1 = Ω3, Ω2 = Ω4, δ1 = δ3, δ2 = δ4, ΓAV
,
2 = ΓAV

. Moreover, the probe linear susceptibility
of Eq. (46a) and the self-Kerr susceptibility of Eq. (47a)
coincide with the corresponding ones of the asymmet-
ric case, Eq. (16) and Eq. (17a) respectively, because
the phenomenological decay rate ΓAV
here plays just
the same role of the phenomenological decay rate ΓAV
of the asymmetric scheme. This is not surprising, since
the probe response in the absence of the trigger ﬁeld is
the same in the two M scheme studied here. Finally the
cross-Kerr susceptibilities of the two schemes are gener-
ally diﬀerent, both for the probe and the trigger, even
though they possess a similar structure. The main rel-
evant diﬀerence between the two cross-Kerr susceptibili-
ties is in the dependence of their real parts upon the de-
tunings. In fact, in the asymmetric case both real parts
are proportional to the composite detuning δ14 = δ12+δ34
(see Eqs. (6) and (38)), so that one has a nonzero XPM
as soon as one of the two Λ subsystem is shifted from

B. Comparison with the Optical Bloch Equations

We now study the dynamics of the symmetric M
scheme of Fig. 8 by means of the OBE, which allow to
describe spontaneous emission and dephasing more rigor-
ously. Due to the similarity of the symmetric and asym-
metric M schemes, we consider the same spontaneous
emission and dephasing processes described in subsec-
tion II C. As a consequence, the master equation for the
atomic density operator ρ is again given by Eq. (19), with
the only diﬀerence that the Hamiltonian H AS
ef f is replaced
by the corresponding Hamiltonian H S
ef f of the symmet-
ric scheme, given by Eq. (39). The corresponding system
of OBE’s for the mean values σij (t)
ρji(t) is
displayed in Appendix B as Eqs. (B1) and (B2), where
we have used the deﬁnitions of Eqs. (20)-(22).

ˆσij (t)

i ≡

≡ h

Also in this symmetric case, the OBE are less suited
for an approximate analytical treatment with respect to
the AV equations of the preceding subsection. In fact, if

j = 1, 2, 4, 5,

at the steady state, it is possible to see that by insert-
ing Eqs. (23) into Eqs. (B2) for the coherences, one gets
a satisfactory expression for the probe linear suscepti-
bility only. To be more speciﬁc, only the approximate
linear susceptibility ﬁts well with the numerical solution
of the OBE. It is not easy to derive analytical expressions
from Eqs. (B1) and (B2) for the nonlinear susceptibilities
which would be as simple as those of Eqs. (47) and which
would reproduce in the same way the exact numerical
solution of the OBE within the EIT regime. Again, one
could exactly solve analytically the OBE, but the result-
ing expressions are very cumbersome and not physically
transparent as those of Eqs. (47). For this reason we will
analytically derive from the OBE the probe linear sus-
ceptibility only, and we will then use the OBE only for
the numerical determination of the atomic steady state.
In addition, deriving this result will enable us to draw
a formal analogy between the AV and OBE treatments
(see Eqs. (51) below).

The probe and trigger susceptibilities are now deﬁned

as

The probe linear susceptibility of Eq. (50a) coincides with
that of the asymmetric M scheme of Eq. (25), as it must
be, since the linear properties of the probe in the two M
schemes are identical. Moreover, as noted before, due to
the symmetry of the scheme, this probe linear susceptibil-
ity coincides with that of the trigger of Eq. (50b) when
the corresponding parameters coincide, i.e., µ32 = µ34,
δ1 = δ3, δ2 = δ4, Ω2 = Ω4, Γ2 = Γ4, γ54 = γ12 and
γ53 = γ13. By comparing Eqs. (50) with Eqs. (46), one
can also see that the AV and OBE predictions for the
linear susceptibilities again coincide provided that the
phenomenological decay rates ΓAV
are appropriately in-
terpreted, i.e.,

This shows again that the intuitive interpretation of the
phenomenological decay rates ΓAV
as spontaneous emis-
sion total decay rates for the excited states, and as de-
phasing rates in the case of ground state sublevels, is
essentially correct.

We then consider the numerical solution of the OBE

the probe and the trigger. In Figs. 9-11 we compare the
analytical solutions of Eqs. (46) and Eqs. (47) with the
numerical solution of the complete set of Bloch equa-
tions given in the Appendix B. Fig. 9 shows the linear
susceptibilities and refers to a perfectly symmetric situa-
tion between probe and trigger, i.e., ΓAV
4 =
6 MHz, Ω1 = Ω3 = 0.08Γ, Ω2 = Ω4 = Γ,
Γ4 = Γ = 2π
×
5 = 10−4Γ. As
1 = ΓAV
δ2 = δ4 = 0,
a consequence, the probe and trigger linear susceptibili-
ties as a function of the respective detunings δ1 and δ3
are two indistinguishable curves. In such a case, group
velocity matching is automatically guaranteed whenever
µ32 = µ34. Fig. 9 shows that Eqs. (46) work very well,
except when the detunings correspond to the maximum
probe (or trigger) absorption. In such a case, the detun-
ings match the Rabi frequencies of the two pumps, and
the probe (or trigger) ﬁeld is in resonance with a single
atomic transition. The atoms are signiﬁcantly pumped
to the excited levels and the population assumption of
Eq. (42) is no more fulﬁlled.

Fig. 10 shows the cross-Kerr susceptibilities again in
a perfectly symmetric situation between probe and trig-
ger so that their plots as a function of the respective
detunings δ1 and δ3 exactly coincide. However, in order
to reduce as much as possible the inﬂuence due to the
simultaneous presence of the self-Kerr susceptibility, we
have considered a probe Rabi frequency Ω1 much smaller
than that of the trigger in the χ(3,ck)
plot and viceversa
a trigger Rabi frequency Ω3 much smaller than that of
the probe in the χ(3,ck)
plot. To be more precise, Fig. 10

χ(3,ck)
plot, and to Ω3 = 0.002Γ, Ω1 = 0.08Γ in the
P
case of the χ(3,ck)
plot. We can see from Fig. 10 that
the AV approach gives a satisfactory description also for
the cross-Kerr susceptibility, except when probe or trig-
ger absorption is maximum, as it happens for the linear
case.

order to reduce the inﬂuence due to the simultaneous

C. Group velocity matching

As we have seen in subsection II D, the condition of
group velocity matching is of fundamental importance
for achieving a large cross-phase modulation between
probe and trigger ﬁelds.
It is evident from the inher-
ent symmetry of the present scheme that the condition
of equal probe and trigger group velocities is automat-
ically achieved when the corresponding parameters are
equal i.e., µ32 = µ34, δ1 = δ3, δ2 = δ4, Ω2 = Ω4, Γ2 = Γ4,
ω3. This is the main ad-
γ54 = γ12 and γ53 = γ13, ω1 ≃
vantage of the symmetric M scheme over the asymmetric
one. As we have seen above, the group velocity of a pulse
is given by

vi
g =

c
1 + ni
g

,

i = P, T,

(52)

where the group index ni
g is given by Eq. (28). The con-
tribution of the nonlinear susceptibilities to vg is negligi-
ble with respect to that of the linear one, which is nonzero

FIG. 10: Comparison of the numerical solution (dotted line)
of the OBE with the analytical prediction of Eqs. (47c,d) (full

of both probe and trigger cross-Kerr susceptibilities versus
their respective normalized probe detunings δ1/Γ and δ3/Γ.
Probe and trigger susceptibilities exactly overlap because we
consider a perfectly symmetric situation: ΓAV
4 =
Γ4 = Γ = 2π × 6 MHz, Ω2 = Ω4 = Γ, δ2 = δ4 = 0, ∀

i,j γij = ΓAV

Ω1 = 0.002Γ, Ω3 = 0.08Γ in the case of the χ(3,ck)
plot, and
viceversa Ω3 = 0.002Γ, Ω1 = 0.08Γ in the case of the χ(3,ck)
plot, in order to reduce as much as possible the inﬂuence of
the self-Kerr susceptibilities.

for both probe and trigger in this case (see Eqs. (45)).
Therefore, approximating χ with the linear contribution

gets the following expressions for the two group indices

where we have used the deﬁnitions of Eqs. (41) for dj,

ger discussed above is evident also in these expressions.
Eqs. (52) and (53) are now compared with the corre-
sponding ones obtained from the integration of the full
set of Bloch equations of Appendix B. The comparison
is shown in Fig. 12, which refers to the completely sym-
metric situation between probe and trigger deﬁned above
and therefore shows exact group velocity matching for all
values of the detunings δ1 = δ3. Fig. 12 shows an excel-
lent agreement between analytical and numerical results.
The only points in which the two curves do not coincide
exactly are when the detunings match the Rabi frequen-
cies of the two pumping ﬁeld. In fact in this conditions
the ﬁelds are in resonance with a single atomic transition

and the atoms are pumped to the excited levels. The
other points that determine the disagreement are in the
vicinity of the peaks. In fact in these regions the deriva-

part of the susceptibilities. Hence, the group index of
Eqs. (53) is small, and the group velocity jumps near c.
In some cases, the perfectly symmetric conditions guar-
anteeing group velocity matching, i.e., µ32 = µ34, δ1 =
δ3, δ2 = δ4, Ω2 = Ω4, Γ2 = Γ4, γ54 = γ12 and γ53 = γ13,

it may be convenient to use transitions with diﬀerent
Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients, yielding therefore a signiﬁ-
cant discrepancy between µ32 and µ34. The other sym-
metry conditions above are less problematic because de-
tunings and Rabi frequencies can always be made equal
by the experimenter, and moreover decay and dephasing
rates, even though not perfectly equal, are often compa-
rable to each other. Just to give an example, one could
implement the symmetric M scheme of Fig. 8 by using
the D1 and D2 line of the 87Rb spectrum. The Zeeman

related to the probe and trigger have dipole moment ma-
trix elements µ32, µ34 diﬀering by a factor √10, violating
therefore the symmetry condition. It is evident however
that this slight asymmetry can be compensated (so that
group velocity matching can be still achieved in a re-
stricted but still useful range of detunings) by properly
adjusting the Rabi frequencies of the tuner ﬁeld Ω4 and
of the coupling ﬁeld Ω2, which will be no more equal. In
fact, by imposing group velocity matching at the center
of the transparency window, i.e., for δ12 = δ34 = 0, we
derive the condition

Ω2 = αΩ4,

As shown in Fig. 13,
if the adjustment condition of

equal probe and trigger group velocities in the case of the
87Rb ﬁve–level scheme speciﬁed above, at least within the
entire EIT window.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied a ﬁve-level atomic system in two dif-
ferent but related M -conﬁgurations. We focused on the
nonlinear properties of the system and speciﬁcally on the
conditions for the optimization of the cross-phase modu-

14

lation between two weak ﬁelds of interest, which we have
named probe and trigger ﬁelds. Both systems have been
studied from a semiclassical point of view, i.e., by de-
scribing all the ﬁelds in terms of their Rabi frequencies.
We have seen that both linear and nonlinear properties
are well described by an approach based on amplitude
variables, which has been shown to reproduce well the
numerical solution of the exact optical Bloch equations
describing the system.

Both the asymmetric and the symmetric M scheme
are able to provide a giant cross-Kerr modulation, which
may be useful for many applications. Both M schemes
can be seen as a “duplication” of the usual three-level Λ
scheme at the basis of EIT, one for the probe and one for
In the asymmetric scheme, only the
the trigger ﬁelds.
probe drives a signiﬁcantly populated transition and a
large cross-Kerr eﬀect is obtained when either the probe
or the trigger is slightly detuned from the two-photon
resonance condition. The corresponding nonlinear phase
shift, yielding for example the conditional phase shift of
Eq. (1) of a quantum phase gate for photonic qubits,
can become very large, especially when the probe and
trigger group velocities, slowed down by EIT, become
equal.
In the asymmetric scheme, this group velocity
matching can be achieved by properly adjusting the de-
tuning and the intensity of the control ﬁeld of the trigger
Λ system. In the symmetric M scheme, the atomic pop-
ulation is equally shared by the probe and trigger tran-
sitions. Adjusting the corresponding parameters (Rabi
frequencies, detunings) so that the two Λ systems be-
come identical, probe and trigger experience the same
interaction with the atomic medium and group velocity
matching is achieved automatically. In this case a signif-
icant nonlinear cross-phase modulation is achieved only
if both Λ schemes are slightly and equally detuned from
two-photon resonance, so to remain still within the trans-
parency window. In fact, due to EIT, the susceptibility
vanishes at all orders at the exact two-photon resonance
condition.

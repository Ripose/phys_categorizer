Abstract

The eﬀective permittivity dyadic of a composite material containing particulate constituent
materials with one constituent having the ability to display the Pockels eﬀect is computed,
using an extended version of the strong–permittivity–ﬂuctuation theory which takes account of
both the distributional statistics of the constituent particles and their sizes. Scattering loss,
thereby incorporated in the eﬀective electromagnetic response of the homogenized composite
material, is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the application of a low–frequency (dc) electric ﬁeld.

Keywords: Strong–permittivity–ﬂuctuation theory, Pockels eﬀect, correlation length, particle
size, potassium niobate

Introduction

Two (or more) materials, each composed of particles which are small compared to all relevant
wavelengths, may be blended together to create an eﬀectively homogeneous material. By ju-
diciously selecting the constituent materials, as well their relative proportions, particle shapes,
orientations and sizes, and distributional statistics, the homogenized composite material (HCM)
can be made to display desirable magnitudes of eﬀective constitutive parameters [1, 2]. Further-
more, an HCM can exhibit eﬀective constitutive parameters which are either not exhibited at

1

all by its constituent materials, or at least not exhibited to the same extent by its constituent
materials [3, 4]. A prime example of such metamaterials is provided by HCMs which support
electromagnetic planewave propagation with negative phase velocity [5].

The focus of this paper is on the electromagnetic constitutive properties of HCMs [1, 6]. If
one (or more) of the constituent materials exhibits the Pockels eﬀect [7], then a further degree
of control over the electromagnetic response properties of an HCM may be achieved. That
is, post–fabrication dynamical control of an HCM’s performance may be achieved through the
application of a low–frequency (dc) electric ﬁeld. For such an HCM, the potential to engineer its
electromagnetic response properties (i) at the fabrication stage by selection of the constituent
materials and particulate geometry, and (ii) at the post–fabrication stage by an applied ﬁeld, is
of considerable technological importance in the area of smart materials [8].

The opportunities oﬀered by the Pockels eﬀect for tuning the response properties of composite
materials have recently been highlighted for photonic band–gap engineering [9, 10] and HCMs
[11]. In particular, the predecessor study exploiting the well–known Bruggeman homogenization
formalism revealed that the greatest degree of control over the HCM’s constitutive parameters
is achievable when the constituent materials are distributed as oriented and highly aspherical
particles and have high electro–optic coeﬃcients [11]. However, the Bruggeman formalism may
not take predict the scattering loss in a composite material adequately enough, as it does not
take into account positional correlations between the particles. Therefore, in the following
sections of this paper, we implement a more sophisticated homogenization approach based on
the strong–permittivity–ﬂuctuation theory (SPFT) which enables us to investigate the eﬀect of
the dc electric ﬁeld on the degree of scattering loss in electro–optic HCMs.

2 Theory

Let us now apply the SPFT to estimate the eﬀective permittivity dyadic of an HCM arising
from two particulate constituent materials, one of which exhibits the Pockels eﬀect. Unlike
conventional approaches to homogenization, as typiﬁed by the usual versions of the much–used
Maxwell Garnett and Bruggeman formalisms [1, 6], the SPFT can take detailed account of the
distributional statistics of the constituent particles [12, 13, 14]. The extended version of the
SPFT implemented here also takes into account the sizes of the constituent particles [15].

2.1 Constituent materials

The two constituent materials are labeled a and b. The particles of both materials are ellipsoidal,
in general. For simplicity, all constituent particles are taken to have the same shape and
orientation, as speciﬁed by the dyadic

with αK > 0
surface of each constituent particle may be parameterized by

[1, 3] and the three unit vectors a1,2,3 being mutually orthogonal. Thus, the

re(θ, φ) = η U • ˆr(θ, φ),

(1)

(2)

where ˆr(θ, φ) is the radial unit vector in the direction speciﬁed by the spherical polar coordinates
θ and φ. The size parameter η > 0 is a measure of the average linear dimensions of the particle. It
is fundamental to the process of homogenization that η is much smaller than all electromagnetic
wavelengths [1]. However, η need not be vanishingly small but just be electrically small [16, 17].

Let Va and Vb denote the disjoint regions which contain the constituent materials a and b,
respectively. The constituent particles are randomly distributed. The distributional statistics
are described in terms of moments of the characteristic functions

The volume fraction of constituent material ℓ, namely fℓ , is given by the ﬁrst statistical moment

The correlation length L > 0 herein is required to be much smaller than the electromagnetic
wavelength(s), but larger than the particle size parameter η. The particular form of the covari-
ance function has little inﬂuence on SPFT estimates of the HCM constitutive parameters, at
least for physically plausible covariance functions [19].



Next we turn to the electromagnetic constitutive properties of the constituent materials.
Material a is simply an isotropic dielectric material with permittivity dyadic ǫ(a) = ǫ(a)I in the
optical regime. In contrast, material b is more complicated as it displays the Pockels eﬀect. Its
linear electro–optic properties are expressed through the inverse of its permittivity dyadic in
the optical regime, which is written as [11]

In order to highlight the degree of electrical control which can be achieved over the HCM’s
permittivity dyadic, we consider scenarios wherein the inﬂuence of the Pockels eﬀect is most con-
spicuous. Therefore, the crystallographic and geometric orientations of the constituent particles
are taken to be aligned from here onwards; furthermore, Edc is aligned with the major crystal-
lographic/geometric principal axis. For convenience, the principal crystallographic/geometric
axes are taken to coincide with the Cartesian basis vectors ux,y,z.

the range for Edc

3 . At L = 0, the variations in ǫHCM

In relation to the predecessor study [11], the eﬀects of two quantities have to be considered: (i)
the correlation length L and (ii) the particle size parameter η. Let us begin with L. In Figure 1,
the three relative permittivity scalars ǫHCM
0 (by setting
D>0 = 0), are plotted as functions of k0L and Edc
x,y,z as
Edc
increases are precisely those predicted by the Bruggeman homogenization formalism [11];
3
but the imaginary parts of ǫHCM
x,y,z are nonzero for L > 0. The emergence of these nonzero
imaginary parts is unambiguously attributable to the incorporation of scattering loss in SPFT.
As L increases, the interactions of larger numbers of constituent particles become correlated,
thereby leading to an increase in the overall scattering loss in the composite material. This is
most noticeable in the z direction (which is direction of the major principal axis of U and ǫ(b),
and also the direction of Edc), as indicated in Figure 1 by the behavior of ǫHCM
. At k0L = 0.2,
the magnitude of the imaginary part of ǫHCM
ranges
from 3

increases by approximately 50% as Edc

The eﬀect of the size parameter η is very similar (but not identical) to that of the correlation
length, as is apparent from Figure 2 wherein the real and imaginary parts of ǫHCM
x,y,z are plotted
against k0η and Edc
x,y,z , which arise for η > 0, are
also attributable to coherent scattering losses associated with the ﬁnite size of the constituent
particles [17]. The eﬀect of the dc electric ﬁeld over the real and imaginary parts of the HCM’s
relative permittivity scalars at a given value of η (with L = 0) is much the same as it is at the
same value of L (with η = 0).

Lastly, let us turn to the combined inﬂuences of the correlation length and the size of the
constituent particles. In Figure 3, plots of the real and imaginary parts of ǫHCM
x,y,z against k0η
and Edc
3 are displayed for the case where k0L = 0.25. Plots of the real parts of ǫHCM
x,y,z are similar
to those in Figures 1 and 2. In contrast, the magnitudes of the imaginary parts of ǫHCM
x,y,z are
substantially larger in Figure 3 than in Figures 1 and 2. As is the case in Figure 2, the imaginary

Let us conclude by stating that a particular feature of the electromagnetic response of an
HCM is that attenuation can arise, due to coherent scattering loss, regardless of whether the
constituent materials are dissipative or nondissipative. The extended SPFT [15] provides a
means of estimating the eﬀect of this scattering loss on the eﬀective constitutive parameters
of the HCM, and relating it to the distributional statistics of the particles which make up the
constituent materials and their size. When one (or more) of the constituent materials exhibits

6

the Pockels eﬀect, the degree of scattering loss may be signiﬁcantly controlled by the application
of a low–frequency (dc) electric ﬁeld. The technological implications of this capacity to control
dynamically, at the post–fabrication stage, the electromagnetic properties of an HCM — which
itself may be tailored to a high degree at the fabrication stage — are far–reaching, extending
to applications in telecommunications, sensing, and actuation, for example.

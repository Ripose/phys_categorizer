A century ago, J. J. Thomson1 showed that the
scattering of low-intensity light by electrons was a
linear process (i.e., the scattered light frequency
was identical to that of the incident light) and
that light’s magnetic ﬁeld played no role. To-
day, with the recent invention of ultra-high-peak-
power lasers2 it is now possible to create a suﬃ-
cient photon density to study Thomson scattering
in the relativistic regime. With increasing light
intensity, electrons quiver during the scattering
process with increasing velocity, approaching the
speed of light when the laser intensity approaches
1018 W/cm2.
In this limit, the eﬀect of light’s
magnetic ﬁeld on electron motion should become
comparable to that of its electric ﬁeld, and the
electron mass should increase because of the rel-
ativistic correction. Consequently, electrons in
such high ﬁelds are predicted to quiver nonlin-
early, moving in ﬁgure-eight patterns, rather than
in straight lines, and thus to radiate photons
at harmonics of the frequency of the incident
laser light3−9, with each harmonic having its own
unique angular distribution5−7. In this letter, we
report the ﬁrst ever direct experimental conﬁr-
mation of these predictions, a topic that has pre-
viously been referred to as nonlinear Thomson
scattering7. Extension of these results to coherent
relativistic harmonic generation10,11 may eventu-
ally lead to novel table-top x-ray sources.

In this experiment, we used a laser system that pro-
duces 400-fs-duration laser pulses at 1.053-µm wave-
length with a maximum peak power of 4 TW. The 50-mm
diameter laser beam was focused with an f/3.3 parabolic
mirror onto the front edge of a supersonic helium gas jet.
The focal spot is consisted of a 7-µm FWHM Gaussian
spot (containing 60 % of the total energy) and a large (>
100 µm) dim spot. The helium gas was fully ionized by
the foot of the laser pulse. A half-wave plate was used
to rotate the axis of linear polarization of the laser beam
in order to vary the azimuthal angle (φ) of observation.
We deﬁne θ = 0◦ as along the direction opposite to that
of the laser propagation and φ = 0◦ as along the axis
of linear polarization. In a linearly polarized laser ﬁeld,
electrons move in a ﬁgure-eight trajectory lying in the

plane deﬁned by the axis of linear polarization and the
direction of beam propagation.

While the observation of harmonics in laser-plasma (or
electron beam) interactions has been made by several
groups12−16, that alone is insuﬃcient to unambiguously
identify nonlinear Thomson scattering and its underlying
dynamics. Several other mechanisms might generate con-
tinuum or harmonics under our experimental conditions,
and, therefore, need to be isolated and discriminated
from the signal generated by nonlinear Thomson scat-
tering: (1) continuum generated from self-phase modula-
tion of laser beam in gas, (2) harmonics generated from
atomic nonlinear susceptibility of gas or, especially, from
the ionization process17, (3) continuum generated from
(a) (relativistic) self-phase modulation of laser pulse in
the plasma, or from (b) electron-electron bremsstrahlung
and electron-ion bremsstrahlung, and (4) harmonics gen-
erated from the interaction of laser pulses with a trans-
verse electron-density gradient14.

The main focal spot of the laser pulse undergoes
relativistic-ponderomotive self-channeling when high
laser power and gas density are used18. Side imaging (θ
= 90◦) of the 1st harmonic light (at the laser frequency)
from nonlinear Thomson scattering shows that the laser
channel has a diameter of <10 µm FWHM. However, in-
terferograms 18 show that the diameter of the plasma col-
umn is about 100-200 µm, which is created by the wings
with intensities > 1015 W/cm2 (the ionization threshold).
Therefore, the light generated from laser-gas interaction
should be observed to originate from the entire region of
plasma, rather than from the narrow laser channel. Re-
sults of side imaging (θ = 90◦ and arbitrary φ) of the
2nd and 3rd harmonics using a matching interference ﬁl-
ter (10 nm bandwidth) show that the signal is emitted
only from the narrow laser channel. In addition, the im-
ages of the harmonics have spatial distributions similar
to the images of the 1st harmonic light, and their proﬁles
vary in the same way as the laser power and gas den-
sity are changed. This rules out the possibility that the
harmonic signal observed in the side images is a result of
laser-gas interaction ((1) and (2)).

According to theory5−7, the harmonic signal generated
from nonlinear Thomson scattering should have two im-
portant features: (1) it is linearly proportional to the
electron density because it is an incoherent single elec-
tron process (the harmonics generated from a collec-
tion of electrons interfere with each other destructively,
leaving only an incoherent signal, which is equal to the

1

single-electron result multiplied by the total number of
electrons which radiate), and (2) it increases roughly
as I n, where n is the harmonic number, and gradu-
ally saturates when a0 is on the order of unity7, where
a0 = eE/m0ω0c = 8.5 × 10−10λ[µm]I 1/2[W/cm2] is the
normalized vector potential, E is the amplitude of laser
electric ﬁeld, and I = cE2/8π is the laser intensity. These
are characteristically diﬀerent from the behavior of any
other mechanisms. For instance, bremsstrahlung radia-
tion should be proportional to the square of gas density
(Ne · Ne or Ne · Ni). In this experiment, the intensity of
the harmonic signal was determined from the peak inten-
sity or the average intensity of the images of harmonics,
when it was plotted as a function of the observing angle,
gas density and laser power. Both showed the same vari-
ations. Figure 1 shows the variation of the 2nd harmonic
signal as a function of laser power and plasma (electron)
density. The experimental results show a reasonable ﬁt
with the theoretical predictions. The 1st and 3rd har-
monics show the same match with the theory.

Although the above two observations are consistent
with nonlinear Thomson scattering as the source of the
harmonic signal, the observation of the unique angular
patterns is necessary in order to prove that the detailed
dynamics of nonlinear Thomson scattering are indeed the
same as the theoretical prediction. Figure 2(a) shows the
φ -dependence of the 2nd harmonic signal at θ = 90◦.
The experimental results match qualitatively with the
theoretical prediction, both having a quadrupole-type ra-
diation pattern, which is characteristically diﬀerent from
the dipole pattern for other mechanisms (1)-(4), and lin-
ear Thomson scattering. Other measurements such as
the φ-dependence of the 2nd harmonic light at θ = 51◦
(an “anti-dipole” pattern), shown in Fig. 2(b), and the
φ-dependence of the 3rd harmonic light at θ = 90◦ (a
“butterﬂy” pattern), shown in Fig. 3, were also made,
all showing reasonable matches between the experimen-
tal data and the theoretical predictions. Such angular
radiation patterns directly prove that electrons do in-
deed oscillate with a ﬁgure-eight trajectory in an intense
(relativistic) laser ﬁeld. The angular pattern of the 1st
harmonic light (linear component) of nonlinear Thomson
scattering is also included in Fig. 2(b) for comparison.

Measurements of the spectra of the harmonics show
that each of the spectra of 2nd and 3rd harmonics con-
tains a peak at roughly the harmonic wavelength and a
red-shifted broader peak, as shown in Fig. 4. The red-
shifted broader peaks are believed to be part of the har-
monic spectra generated by nonlinear Thomson scatter-
ing, because they vary in amplitude proportionally with
the corresponding unshifted harmonic signals when the
gas density and laser power are changed.
It was ex-
pected that the spectra of harmonics should be broad-
ened tremendously for electrons in a high-ﬂuid-velocity
plasma wave6. A fast-phase-velocity electron plasma
wave (with a maximum ﬂuid velocity of as large as ∼0.2 c,

where c is the speed of light in vacuum) excited by stim-
ulated Raman forward scattering19 was observed in this
experiment at high laser power and gas density. However,
the fact that the spectral distribution of the harmonics
was not observed to change signiﬁcantly with variation
of gas density and laser power, when the plasma wave
amplitude was, indicates that such spectral structure has
nothing to do with the collective drift motion of electrons
in the plasma waves. Although the angular radiation pat-
terns of the harmonics could also be aﬀected by such a 0.2
c ﬂuid-velocity oscillation, the changes are not signiﬁcant
enough (compare the solid and dash lines in Fig. 2(a))
to be identiﬁed from the experimental data7. In other
words, all measurements done in this experiment match
qualitatively with the prediction of incoherent nonlinear
Thomson scattering of electrons without drift motion;
the results appear not to be aﬀected by the existence
of plasma waves, probably due to destructive coherent
interference. The absolute scattering eﬃciency is mea-
sured to be 8 × 10−4 and 1 × 10−4 photons per electron
per pulse for the 2nd and 3rd harmonics (including both
the unshifted and red-shifted spectral components), re-
spectively, at θ = 90◦, φ = 50◦, for an angle of collection
of 7 × 10−3 steradians. These numbers match reason-
ably well with the theoretical predictions for incoherent
nonlinear Thomson scattering, which are 8 × 10−4 and
5 × 10−4, respectively.

In summary, the results reported here conﬁrm for the
ﬁrst time several predictions of relativistic electrody-
namic theory, which were formulated forty years ago, co-
incident with the invention of the laser. As predicted
7, a century-old fundamental “constant,” the Thomson
cross-section, is now shown to depend on the strength of
light.

We study numerically, by means of the pseudospectral time-domain method, the unique features
of imaging by a ﬂat lens made of a left-handed metamaterial that possesses the property of negative
refraction. We demonstrate and conﬁrm the earlier ﬁnding that a left-handed ﬂat lens can provide
near-perfect imaging of a point source and a pair of point sources with clear evidence of the sub-
wavelength resolution.

The unique properties of left-handed (LH) materi-
als [1], i.e. materials with simultaneously negative real
parts of dielectric permittivity ǫr and magnetic perme-
ability µr, allow focusing of electromagnetic waves by a
ﬂat slab of the material; this eﬀect is in sharp contrast
to conventional optical lenses with a positive refractive
index that need to have curved surfaces to form an im-
age. Recently, Pendry [2] argued that a slab of a lossless
LH material with ǫr = µr =
1 should behave as a per-
fect lens enabling one to obtain an ideal image of a point
source through the reconstitution of the evanescent wave
components. While recent experiments conﬁrmed the
main features of negative refraction [3, 4], the question of
near-perfect imaging of a ﬂat lens and near-ﬁeld focusing
has remain highly controversial [5], and it severely con-
strained because of large dissipation and anisotropy in
the metamaterial. Nevertheless, some of the numerical
studies indicate (see, e.g., Ref. [6]) that nearly-perfect
imaging should be expected even under realistic condi-
tions when both dispersion and losses of the left-handed
material are taken into account.

−

In this Letter, we re-visit the problem of the nearly per-
fect imaging by a ﬂat lens made of a left-handed metama-
terial and study numerically, by use of the pseudospectral
time-domain method, imaging by a ﬂat lens made of a
left-handed metamaterial. In order to study the ampli-
ﬁcation of the evanescent waves, we compare the wave-
vector spectra of the ﬁeld at the image plane in the case
with and without the LH slab. We demonstrate and con-
ﬁrm the earlier ﬁnding that a left-handed ﬂat lens can
provide near-perfect imaging of a point source and a pair
of point sources with clear evidence of the sub-wavelength
resolution.

We model an electrical line current source in front of
a slab of LH material embedded in free space, as shown
in Fig. 1. The system is translationally invariant in the
z direction and is treated as two-dimensional. The simu-
=
lations are performed in TE polarization (Hx, Hy, Ez 6
0).
In the y direction the system is considered open,
as achieved through reﬂectionless absorbing boundaries,
while the x direction is taken as periodic. Because of this
the simulation essentially uses an array of sources and an
inﬁnite slab.

It has been shown that a material with left-handed
character can only be achieved through dispersion [1].

FIG. 1: Schematic view of the model system. A current source
is placed in front of a LH slab. In y direction the system mod-
els an open domain through the use of reﬂectionless absorb-
ing boundaries (PML), while it is periodic in the x direction.
The solid dot indicates the source location while the dashed
lines denote the observation planes, i.e. the source and image
planes.

Therefore, the LH material is assumed to have lossy
Drude characteristics in both electric permittivity and
magnetic permeability [2], given by

Here ωpe, ωpm are the plasma frequencies and γe, γm
are the collision frequencies of the electric and magnetic
properties, respectively. To simplify and to impedance
match the slab to free space, we take ωpe = ωpm = ωp and
γe = γm = γ. The material parameters are chosen to give
1 at frequency
a refractive index with real part Re(n) =
f0 = 15 GHz (ω0 = 2πf0). For this we use ωp = 2π√2f0.
The collision frequency is γ = 2π
4.5 MHz, which results
in εr(ω0) = µr(ω0) =

1 + 0.0006i.
We directly simulate the ﬁeld propagation based on
Maxwell’s equations, using the pseudospectral time-
domain method [7]. In this method all ﬁeld components
are sampled at the same spatial location which avoids
ambiguities of the material interfaces [8] inherent in the

the problems caused by transition layers at the interfaces
[11]. The domain walls in the y direction are covered with
a uniaxial perfectly-matched layer (PML) [12, 13, 14]
boundary to simulate an open domain. In the x direction
the system is periodic.

The material constitutive relations are implemented

using the auxiliary diﬀerential equation method [15].

The current source is turned on slowly using a temporal

22/f0, to reduce its band width and allow the system

The simulation uses a time step of ∆t = 29.2873 ns and
a spatial step size of ∆x = ∆y = λ0/100 = 0.199862 m;
λ0 is the free-space propagating wavelength at frequency
128 and is iterated for
f0. The simulation size is 1024
600000 time steps, i.e. 2635 periods, to ensure steady-

It has been shown that a slab of LH material with
parallel sides should focus propagating [1] and evanescent
[2] waves. Thus, if the slab thickness d is greater than the
distance a between the object (source) and the front face
of the slab, then one expects an image to form inside the
slab, a distance a from the front face, as well as behind
a from the back face, as indicated
the slab, a distance d
in Fig. 1.

First, we place a single source a distance a = 0.2λ0
in front of a slab with thickness 0.3λ0. Snapshots of
the electric ﬁeld in the source plane and the two image
planes are shown in Fig. 2. The snapshots were taken
when the ﬁeld was at its maximum in the source plane,
which was also the time of maximum ﬁeld in the image
planes. The ﬁeld of the source plane is well reproduced
in the image planes. The feature size of the central peak
in the image planes is well below the free-space limit of
λ0/2. To illustrate that point we performed a spatial
Fourier transform of this data and show the transverse

wave vector dependence of the image-plane ﬁelds rela-
tive to the source-plane ﬁeld in Fig. 3. For comparison
the ﬁgure also shows the spectrum in the same planes
when the LH slab is replaced by air. In the case without
the LH slab, waves with transverse wave vector greater
than 1/λ0, corresponding to evanescent waves, are al-
most entirely absent in the image planes.
In contrast,
when the LH slab is present, waves with transverse wave
vector up to 2.8/λ0 are transmitted to the image loca-
tions. This agrees with the smaller than λ0/2 features
present in Fig. 2. At 2.8/λ0 a peak occurs in the spec-
trum, similar to the results reported in [16].

We also study the imaging of a pair of sources in order
to characterize the possibility of sub-wavelength resolu-

broader than the source peaks in the source plane. On
the other hand, the central peak is narrower and has sim-
ilar strength to the images of the sources. In the image
plane inside the slab the central peak is stronger than
the source images, but the images are still individually
visible.

With a source separation 0.3λ0 the central interference
peak in the image planes overlaps and hides the image
peaks in the time-integrated signal. In the source plane
peaks at the source location are still visible but of similar
strength to the interference peak. In the instantaneous
ﬁeld snapshots, on the other hand, the image peaks re-
produce the source peaks well and are clearly distinct
from the interference peak, due to the time diﬀerence
between their occurrences.

Figure 5 shows a two-dimensional false-color plot of the
absolute magnitude of the electric ﬁeld with two sources.
The geometry and orientation is as indicated in Fig. 1.
One clearly sees the two sources and the strong ﬁelds
they excite at the surfaces. Away from the sources, the
surface waves disappear due to the absorption of the LH
medium. One notices that in the image planes the source
images are resolved in the transverse, i.e. x, direction but
not in the y direction.

In conclusion, we have studied the unique features of
imaging by a ﬂat lens made of a left-handed metama-
terial that possesses the property of negative refraction.
By employing the pseudospectral time-domain method
and comparing with the wave propagation in air, we
have demonstrated near-perfect imaging of a point source
and a pair of point sources with clear evidence of sub-
wavelength resolution. We believe that a potential ad-
vantage of this kind of imaging is its scalability to sub-
micrometer scales to make possible imaging and nano-
photolithography with spatial resolution in the tens of
nanometers.

tion. The single source is replaced by a pair, separated by
0.35λ0. The two sources have the same time dependence,
i.e. are in-phase. In Fig. 4 snapshots of the electric ﬁeld
in the source and image planes are shown. The snapshots
are again taken at the same time and show the ﬁeld at its
maximum. One clearly sees that features with size less
than λ0/2 are reproduced in the images.

Besides the instantaneous ﬁeld distributions of Fig. 4,
the temporal Fourier transform component of the ﬁelds
in the source and image planes at the source frequency
was also calculated (not shown). Two strong peaks cor-
responding to the sources are clearly visible in the source
plane. An additional, much weaker peak appears be-
tween them due to the constructive interference of the
waves emitted by the sources. This central peak occurs
at a later time than the source peaks because the ﬁeld
has to propagate from the sources to the location be-
tween them. In a temporal Fourier transform this time
diﬀerence manifests itself as a phase diﬀerence. In the
image plane on the far side of the slab, the images are

Abstract

Connection between the concept of entanglement and origin of nonlin-

ear phenomena in optics is discussed.

PACS number: 03.65.-w, 42.50Gy, 42.50.Hz

The concept of entanglement plays an important role in quantum mechanics
and usually it is connected with so-called nonlocality of quantum mechanical
interactions in space [1, 2]. Many years it is extensively studied due to fun-
damental interest and also for possible practical applications in the ﬁelds of
communication and quantum computation. Substantially less attention is de-
voted to the so-called entanglement in time [3-7].

The concept of entanglement in time can also have other sense as a mem-
ory of quantum system about the initial state. Does such memory possible?
The experiments clearly show that such memory of quantum system about the
initial state really exists and manifests itself through inequality of forward and
reversed processes in optics [8-10]. Eﬃciency of the reversed process may be
much greater, than the eﬃciency of forward one.

In the recent experimental works [8, 9] the forward (splitting) and reversed
(mixing) processes with a photons were studied (Fig.1b). On the ﬁrst stage the
narrowband (0.04 nm) radiation of nanosecond laser was transformed through
down-conversion in the nonlinear crystal into two intense broadband beams
(each spectral width ∼ 100nm). On the second stage this two broadband beams
were mixed in the sum frequency generator [9] or in the process of two photon
excitation of rubidium atoms [8]. The mixing of entangled photons leads to
regeneration of initial narrowband radiation and is the example of reversed pro-
cess into the initial state.
In contrast, the mixing of non-entangled photons
should give broadband radiation and is the example of again only forward pro-
cess. Both experiments show the same result: the eﬃciency of reversed process
is much greater, than the eﬃciency of forward process. In these experiments
the entangled photons demonstrate the memory about the initial state.

In the next case a polyatomic molecules demonstrate such memory [10]. Ex-
citation and deexcitation of SF6 molecules by CO2-laser radiation was studied
in this work (Fig.1a). The forward process (photon absorption) in this case
has extremely high spectral width ∼ 150 GHz (the so-called wide component
of line [11]). In contrast, the reversed process (stimulated emission) has very

small spectral width. The diﬀerence in spectral width of forward and reversed
processes exceeds ﬁve orders of magnitude. Accordingly, the cross-section of the
reversed process turns out to be in several orders of magnitude greater, than
the cross-section of forward process [12].

The discussed experiments [8-10] are the direct experimental proofs of in-
equality of forward and reversed processes. Furthermore, we have enormous
quantity of indirect proofs. The nonlinear optics, as a whole, looks like as a
large accumulation of indirect evidences of such inequality. Nonlinear phenom-
ena in optics usually are described by mathematical models which are based
on the Bloch equations. Such mathematical models usually give good descrip-
tion of nonlinear eﬀects but, in fact, its do not have any clear physical sense.
The concepts of coherent states, wavepackets and their interference are used
for explanation of physical nature of nonlinear phenomena. At the same time
the question about the existence of coherent states is debated in literature [13].
Some theorists argue that the inability to measure the absolute phase of an
electromagnetic ﬁeld prohibits the representation of a lasers output as a quan-
tum optical coherent state [14, 15]. In fact, it means, that using the concept of
coherent states for explanation of nonlinear phenomena does not have physical
sense.

Alternative explanation of origin of nonlinear phenomena in optics is based
on the concept of inequality of forward and reversed processes [16]. It gives really
simple and clear interpretation of origin of nonlinear phenomena. A terminal
stage of nonlinear processes (there are usually a multiple step photon mixing
processes) is returning the system into the initial state. This process proceeds
with extremely high eﬃciency. Because of a photon has spin, it is impossible
to return exactly into the initial state with odd number of photons. That is
why in the gas and liquid phase the observed nonlinear eﬀects are based only
on schemes with even number of photons (four, six and so on photon mixing).
In a solid state with rigid lattice the rotational motion of atoms and molecules
may be completely suppressed and the role of a photon’s spin vanishes. In this
case the nonlinear eﬀects with odd number of photons become possible (three
photon mixing).

The concept of initial state of quantum system should include also the orien-
tation of molecule in space and even the phase of vibrational motion of atoms.
Thanks to this fact the experimental study of rotational and vibrational motions
of molecules in the real time become possible [17, 18].

So, we need to originate a new mathematical model (alternative to the
Bloch equations) for description the dynamics of optical transitions. Such model
should be based on the concept of inequality of forward and reversed processes.
In conclusion, we point out that the study of entanglement in time does not

less important task, than the study of entanglement in space.

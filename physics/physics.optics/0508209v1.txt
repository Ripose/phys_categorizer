SUMMARY

We outline speciﬁc features of numerical simulations of metamaterial wedges and interfaces. We
study the eﬀect of diﬀerent positioning of a grid in the Yee method, which is necessary to obtain
consistent convergence in modeling of
interfaces with metamaterials characterized by negative
dielectric permittivity and negative magnetic permeability. We demonstrate however that, in the
framework of the continuous-medium approximation, wave scattering on the wedge may result in a
resonant excitation of surface waves with inﬁnitely large spatial frequencies, leading to non-convergence
of the simulation results that depend on the discretization step. Copyright c(cid:13) 2000 John Wiley &

1. INTRODUCTION

Recent theoretical [1, 2, 3, 4] and experimental [5, 6, 7] studies have shown the possibility of
creating novel types of microstructured materials that demonstrate the property of negative
refraction. In particular, the composite materials created by arrays of wires and split-ring
resonators were shown to possess both negative real parts of magnetic permeability and
dielectric permittivity for microwaves. These materials are often referred to as left-handed
metamaterials, double-negative materials, negative-index materials, or materials with negative
refraction. Properties of such materials were ﬁrst analyzed theoretically by V. Veselago a
long time ago [8], but they were demonstrated experimentally only recently. As was shown
by Veselago [8], left-handed metamaterials possess a number of peculiar properties, including
negative refraction for interface scattering, inverse light pressure, reverse Doppler eﬀect, etc.
Many suggested and demonstrated applications of negative-index metamaterials utilize
unusual features of wave propagation and scattering at the interfaces. In particular, the eﬀect
of negative refraction can be used to realize focusing with a ﬂat slab, the so-called planar
lens [8]; in a sharp contrast with the well-known properties of conventional lenses with a
positive refractive index where curved surfaces are needed to form an image. Moreover, the

resolution of the negative-index ﬂat lens can be better than a wavelength due to the eﬀect of
ampliﬁcation of evanescent modes [9].

Direct numerical simulations provide the unique means for a design of microwave and
optical devices based on the negative-index materials, however any realistic simulation should
take into account metamaterial dispersion and losses [10, 11, 12, 13] as well as a nonlinear
response [14]. Such numerical simulations are often carried out within the framework of the
eﬀective medium approximation, when the metamaterial is characterized by the eﬀective
dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability. This simpliﬁcation allows for modelling
of large-scale wave dynamics using the well-known ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD)
numerical methods [15].

In this paper, we discuss the main features and major diﬃculties in applying the standard
FDTD numerical schemes for simulating wave scattering by wedges and interfaces of ﬁnite-
extend negative-index metamaterials, including a key issue of positioning of a discretization
grid in the numerical Yee scheme [16] necessary to obtain consistent convergence in modeling
surface waves at an interface between conventional dielectric and metamaterial with negative
dielectric permittivity and negative magnetic permeability. In particular, we demonstrate that,
in the framework of the continuous-medium approximation, wave scattering on the wedge may
result in a resonant excitation of surface waves with inﬁnitely large spatial frequencies, leading
to non-convergence of the simulation results that depend on the discretization step.

2. BASIC EQUATIONS

We consider a two-dimensional problem for the propagation of TE-polarized electromagnetic
waves in the plane (x, z), where the medium properties are isotropic and characterized
by the dielectric permittivity ε and magnetic permeability µ. In the absence of losses,
Im ε = Im µ = 0. The response of negative-index materials is known to be strongly frequency
dependent [1], however in the linear regime the wave propagation at diﬀerent wavelengths can
be described independently. The stationary form of Maxwell’s equation for the complex wave
envelopes is well-known

constrained by anisotropy and losses of the metamaterials. Nevertheless, several numerical
studies showed that nearly-perfect imaging should be expected even under realistic conditions
when both dispersion and losses are taken into account [10, 11, 12, 13]. In this section, we
consider the numerical simulations of the wave scattering by a slab of the negative-index
material, i.e. the problem close to that of the perfect lens imaging, and discuss the convergence
of the Yee numerical discretization scheme.

3.1. Geometry and discretization

We start our analysis by considering wave propagation through a slab made of the negative-
index material, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1, with homogeneous properties in the
(y, z) plane characterized by two functions, the electric permittivity ε = ε(x) and magnetic
permeability µ = µ(x). To solve this problem numerically, we employ the well-known numerical
Yee method [15] and perform the discretization of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds on a square
grid (xm = h m, zn = h n) presenting the ﬁelds in the form,

Ey|m,n = hEyim,n, Hz|m+1/2,n = hHzi|m+1/2,n, Hx|m,n+1/2 = hHxi|m,n+1/2,

where we use the notation

Then, we replace the continuum model by a closed set of the discrete equations for the ﬁeld
amplitudes obtained by averaging equations (1) over the cells of discretization mesh, taking
into account the continuity of the tangential ﬁeld components at the interface [15],

1,2,3 in (a). The computational domain is 0 < x < 6.4, d2 = 1.4 is the width of the negative-index
layer with ε2 = −1.2 and µ2 = −1.5, and ε1 = µ1 = 1. The wavenumber in vacuum is normalized as
ω/c = 1.

Whereas the general form of the discrete equations (4) is well known [15], we point out a number
of speciﬁc features arising in numerical simulations of the waves scattering at the interfaces
with the negative-index media. Since the real parts of both ε and µ change sign at these
interfaces, the corresponding averaged values may become small or even vanish for a certain
layer position with respect to the numerical grid. In this case, Eqs. (4) may become (almost)
singular, leading to poor convergence. In this paper, we suggest that consistent convergence
can be achieved by artiﬁcially shifting the layer boundary with respect to the grid in order
to ensure that the averaged values do not vanish. This shift will not exceed h/2, assuring
convergence as the step-size is decreased.

Because the tangential component Ey of the electric ﬁeld should be continuous at the
interface, is seems that a natural choice is to align the boundary position with the grid
points xm, where Ey|m,n is deﬁned, and we use this conﬁguration in the numerical simulations
presented below. However, we note that such a selection leads to singularities for averaged
values if ε1 = −ε2 or µ1 = −µ2, which coincides with the ﬂat-lens condition. Therefore, it
is necessary to take into account losses in the metamaterial, described by nonzero imaginary
parts of the complex values ε2 and µ2, or to choose a diﬀerent boundary alignment to the grid
for the numerical simulations of perfect lenses [1].

3.2. Wave spectrum and convergence of discrete solutions

In order to illustrate the convergence of the proposed numerical scheme, we compare the
solutions of discrete and continuous equations. We note that wave scattering from an inﬁnite

layer is fully characterized by the properties of spatial modes, which wavevector components
along the layer (kz) are conserved. These modes have the form

E(x, z) = E(x; kz)exp(ikzz), H(x, z) = H(x; kz)exp(ikzz).

(5)

Substituting Eqs. (5) into Eq. (1) and Eq. (4), we obtain a set of corresponding continuous
and discrete eigenmode equations. For every kz, the mode proﬁles can be determined
analytically, e.g., using the transfer-matrix method [18]. The wave spectrum can contain
solutions corresponding to the guided modes of a negative-index layer [19], and extended
(or propagating) modes that should also be taken into account as well, in order to describe
scattering of arbitrary ﬁelds.

We solve the discrete eigenmode equations numerically for the slab geometry with periodic

boundary conditions, and compare the spectrum of eigenvalues kz with exact solutions of the
continuous model. In Fig. 2(a), we show a part of the spectrum of the discrete eigenvalues
(crosses), which indeed coincides with the exact values (circles). The rate of convergence can
be judged from Fig. 2(b), where the diﬀerences between the approximate and exact solutions
are shown in logarithmic scale.

4. WAVE SCATTERING BY A WEDGE OF NEGATIVE-INDEX MATERIAL

One of the fundamental problems in the theory of negative-index metamaterials is the wave
scattering by wedges [20], where convergence of numerical methods can be slow due to the
appearance of singularities [21]. In this section, we demonstrate that the nature of such
singularities has to be taken into account when performing FDTD numerical simulations.

4.1. Singularity parameter

The behavior of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds at the wedges between homogeneous materials
characterized by diﬀerent values of ε and µ was described analytically in the pioneering paper
of Meixner [21] and further reﬁned in the subsequent studies (see, e.g., Ref. [22], and references

therein). In the case of the TE wave scattering by a negative-index wedge, as schematically
illustrated in Fig. 3, the amplitudes of magnetic ﬁelds exhibit singular behavior at the wedge of
the order of ργ−1, where ρ is the distance from the wedge. For a π/2 wedge angle, corresponding
to a corner of a rectangular slab, the coeﬃcient γ is found as [21]

where µ1 and µ2 are magnetic permeabilities of the two neighboring media. In the case of
conventional dielectric or magnetic media with µj > 0, Eq. (6) has solutions with real γ.
However, when µ changes its sign at the interface with a negative-index medium, the coeﬃcient
γ becomes complex playing role of a singularity parameter. This happens when

−3µ1 < µ2 < −µ1/3,

(6)

(7)

so that |µ1 − µ2|/|µ1 + µ2| > 2, see Fig. 4.

For real γ (taking the solution with 0 < γ < 1, according to Ref. [21]), the ﬁeld amplitudes
decay monotonously away from the corner. In this case, numerical simulations may be based
on the simplest discretization, although the convergence rate can be improved by taking into
account the singular behavior in the discrete equations.

However, the case of complex γ corresponds to the ﬁelds that oscillate inﬁnitely fast near

the corner because

ργ−1 = ρRe(γ−1) exp [i Im(γ) log(ρ)] .

The second multiplier indicates the excitation of inﬁnitely large spatial harmonics, however
such a situation is unphysical because the eﬀective-medium approximation of the negative-
index materials is valid for slowly varying ﬁelds only. Therefore, in numerical simulations it is
necessary to take into account the physical eﬀects that suppress such oscillations, in particular
we discuss the eﬀect of losses in Sec. 4.3 below.

4.2. Numerical results

We now analyze convergence of the numerical ﬁnite-diﬀerence solutions for the problem of wave
scattering by a ﬁnite-extent negative-index slab. We align the boundaries of the negative-index
domain with the grid, as shown schematically in Fig. 1(b). Since the electric ﬁeld components
Ey are continuous at the interfaces, it is possible to obtain the discrete equations that have
the form of Eqs. (4).

In order to construct the full solutions for scattering problem, we decompose the ﬁeld into a
set of eigenmodes of the negative-index layer (z > 0) and free space (z < 0). More speciﬁcally,

Here N is the number of points in the x direction, and the discrete wavenumber is K (j) =

asymptotic behavior, i.e., we choose Re(K (j)) > 0, if K (j) is real, and Im(K (j)) > 0 if K (j)
is complex. The magnetic ﬁeld at z < 0 is found from Eq. (4), with homogeneous parameters
hεi = ε1, hµi = µ1, hµ−1i = µ−1
1 . Then, we substitute Eqs. (8), (9) into the ﬁrst of Eq. (4),
and using the condition of the continuity of the electric ﬁeld, obtain a set of equations for all

We now present results of our numerical simulations for the scattering of normally incident
plane waves, with F (in)
j6=0 = 0. First, we consider scattering by a negative-index slab
with µ2 < −3. In this case, we observe a steady convergence of numerical solutions, as shown
in Fig. 5. This demonstrates that even simplest ﬁnite-diﬀerence numerical schemes can be
successfully employed to model the scattering process when the sinularity parameter γ is real,
is in a full agreement with earlier studies of wave scattering at dielectric wedges [22].

However, the situation changes dramatically when γ is complex, i.e. for µ2 = −1.5. According
to the analytical solution, in this case the magnetic ﬁeld should oscillate inﬁnitely fast in
the vicinity of the corner, corresponding to excitation of inﬁnitely large spatial harmonics.
However, such behavior cannot be described by discrete equations, and we ﬁnd that in this
regime solutions of ﬁnite-diﬀerence equation do not converge, as demonstrated in Fig. 6.

4.3. Eﬀects of losses

The analytical description of the edge singularities discussed above is only valid for lossless
media, i.e. when all ε and µ are real. However, the negative-index metamaterials always have

non-vanishing losses, and we have studied whether this important physical eﬀect can regularize
the ﬁeld oscillations at the corner. However, our results demonstrate that even substantial
losses may not be suﬃcient enough to suppress such oscillations, as presented in the example
of Fig. 7.

4.4. Singularities and perfect lenses

Finally, we consider the problem of wave scattering from the corners of perfect lenses, where
Re (ε2) ≃ −1 and Re (µ2) ≃ −1 (we take ε1 = µ1 = 1). This is a special case, where the type
of singularity becomes indeﬁnite if losses are neglected. We ﬁnd that introducing suﬃciently
large losses does indeed regularize the ﬁeld oscillations at the corners , leading to convergence
of numerical simulations, as demonstrated for the example of Fig. 8. However, this only occurs
when the value of losses exceeds a certain threshold; if the losses are too weak then non-
convergent behavior is again observed, as shown in Fig. 9. The threshold value of losses for
achieving convergence of the numerical scheme is increased for larger |Re (µ2) + 1|. We note
that this is completely diﬀerent from the temporal dynamics at an inﬁnitely extended slab,
where convergence to a steady state is eventually achieved with arbitrarily small losses [12].

5. CONCLUSIONS

We have discussed a number of speciﬁc features manifested in numerical simulations of wedges
and interfaces of metamaterials, i.e. composite materials with negative dielectric permittivity
and negative magnetic permeability. We have demonstrated that a numerical discretization
grid in the Yee method may have a dramatic eﬀect on the convergence in numerical modelling
of surface waves at interfaces and wedges. In the framework of the continuous-medium
approximation, wave scattering on the wedge may result in a resonant excitation of surface
waves with inﬁnitely large spatial frequencies, leading to non-convergence of the numerical
simulation results that depend strongly on the value of the discretization step. We ﬁnd that
suﬃciently high losses may suppress oscillations and allow to obtain converging solutions to
the scattering problem, however in the case of smaller losses it may be necessary to take into
account the meta-material properties beyond the eﬀective-medium approximation, such as the
eﬀect of spatial dispersion.

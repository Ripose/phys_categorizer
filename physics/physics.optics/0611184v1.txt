While adaptive optical systems are able to remove moderate wavefront
distortions in scintillated optical beams, phase singularities that appear in
strongly scintillated beams can severely degrade the performance of such an
adaptive optical system. Therefore, the detection of these phase singularities is
an important aspect of strong scintillation adaptive optics. We investigate the
detection of phase singularities with the aid of a Shack-Hartmann wavefront
in spite of some systematical deﬁciencies inherent
sensor and show that,
it can be used for the reliable
to the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor,
detection of phase singularities, irrespective of their morphologies. We provide
full analytical results, together with numerical simulations of the detection
process.

Introduction

The Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWS) is a widely used system to measure the
shape of the wavefront of an optical beam that was scintillated after propagating through a
turbulent atmosphere. The reasonable simplicity of the SHWS makes it ideal for use in an
adaptive optical system, which is to correct the wavefront distortions in such a scintillated
beam.

Various techniques exist1–6 to compute the shape of the wavefront from the raw data
received as output from a SHWS. However, in strongly scintillated beams these techniques
tend to fail7 due to the presence of phase singularities, which represent optical vortices8, 9 in
the propagating scintillated beam. The failure of these techniques is to some extent a result
of the apparent insensitivity of the SHWS to the phase function of a phase singularity,10
which led to it being referred to as hidden phase. Phase singularities are points where the
phase is undeﬁned and where the phase around the singularity goes continuously through all
phase values from 0 to 2π. The direction (right-handed or left-handed) of increasing value

a singularity can in general be anisotropically scaled along a particular direction, which
gives rise to its morphology. An isotropic singularity is referred to as being canonical and
anisotropic singularities are called noncanonical.

Initial least-squares phase reconstruction methods,1–4 that were used in adaptive optical
sytems, were based on a model for the phase slopes that makes the assumption that the
phase function is continuous. The existence of phase singularities violates this assumption.
Therefore, these methods can only be applied in application where the phase distortions are
not large enough to generate phase singularities.

More recently, various authors11–14 considered the separation of the phase gradient function
into a continuous (curl-free) part and a solenoidal or rotational part. The former can be
used in the adaptive optical system to correct the continuous part of the phase distortions.
The latter is generally treated as a noise term, which is discarded. Since it represents the
contribution of the phase singularities, the solenoidal part of the phase distortions cannot
be removed in the same way that the continuous part of the phase distortions is removed.
Neither does it simply go away after the continuous part has been corrected. It is therefore
important to consider this solenoidal part of the phase distortions more carefully in order
to ﬁnd a way to get rid of the phase singularities. In this paper we consider the detection of
the locations and topological charges of the phase singularities with the aid of the solenoidal
part of the phase gradient function. We show that the SHWS is not completely insensitive
to the phase of a singularity. In other words, this phase is not completely hidden, but is
contained in the solenoidal part of the output of the SHWS. One can therefore use it to
locate the phase singularities that are present in the wavefront.

The detection of the phase singularities is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the averaging eﬀects
of the SHWS subapertures. This averaging eﬀect has not to date received much attention.
Herrmann15 mentioned the model error due to the averaging gradients, but did not give a
detailed analysis. Aksenov13 calculated the average wavefront slopes with a regularization
procedure that produces continuous inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable functions, which is not true when
there are singularities in the phase function. In this paper, we analyze the eﬀect of the
averaging process on a phase singularity, by performing the actual integration of the phase
gradient function of such a singularity over the area of a subaperture. From this result one
can then show that it is possible to extract the required information of the phase singularities
regardless of the eﬀects of the averaging process. For a continuous vector ﬁeld the singularities
can be identiﬁed by computing the curl of this vector ﬁeld. The output from a SHWS is in
the form of a sampled vector ﬁeld that approximately represents the gradient of the phase
function of the scintillated beam. We implement the curl operation that operates on this
sampled vector ﬁeld in terms of ﬁnite diﬀerences. This ﬁnite diﬀerence curl operation is

2

referred to as the circulation of the sampled vector ﬁeld. The complete detection process
thus consists of the averaging process performed by the SHWS and the circulation process
performed on its output. The eﬀect of the morphology and relative position of the singularity
on this detection process is also investigated.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we’ll discuss the basic
principle upon which the detection of phase singularities is based and provide some notation.
The operation of the SHWS is discussed in Section 3. In Section 4 we discuss the detection
of phase singularities with the output of the SHWS. We analyse this for a canonical phase
singularity and compute the peak value in Subsection 4.A and then repeat this analysis for
the more general noncanonical phase singularity in Subsection 4.B. The complete expression
of the circulation for a noncanonical phase singularity is given in Appendix A. A numerical
simulation is provided in Section 5 to test the procedure on more realistic data. A summary
and conclusions are provided in Section 6.

2. Basic principle of operation

The phase function of a scintillated optical beam can in general be represented by the sum
of a continuous phase function and an arbitrary number of phase singularities,

practical implementation of singularity detection.

To implement a singularity detection procedure with a physical system one can use the
output of a SHWS, which measures the gradient of the phase function. For the moment we’ll
assume that this measurement is ideal and we’ll return to the eﬀect of the ﬁnite subapertures
of the SHWS in Section 3. One can view the output of a SHWS as a vector ﬁeld G =
Gx(x, y)ˆx + Gy(x, y)ˆy. If this vector ﬁeld represents the gradient of a continuous phase
function, we must have,

∂Gx(x, y)
∂y

=

∂Gy(x, y)
∂x

.

(8)

If one ﬁnds that this is not the case then it indicates that G cannot be the gradient of a
continuous phase function. This points to the presence of phase singularities. The extent
to which the equality in Eq. (5) fails is given by the diﬀerence between its left-hand and
right-hand sides, which becomes the curl of the vector ﬁeld. Since the vector ﬁeld only has
x- and y-components that only depend on x and y, its curl is a scalar which represents the
z-component given by

D(x, y) =

G(x, y).

∇T ×
If the phase function of a scintillated optical beam is continuous (without phase singular-
ities), the curl of the gradient of the phase function would give zero. On the other hand, if
there are phase singularities in the phase function of the beam then the curl of this gradi-
ent is not zero.16 Each phase singularity gives a Dirac delta function at the location of the
singularity,

(6)

φ(x, y, α, β) = τ 2πδ(x)δ(y),

where τ (=
1) is the topological charge of the phase singularity. So the curl of the gradient of
a phase function θ(x, y) that contains phase singularities gives a sum of Dirac delta functions,
each multiplied with the topological charge of the singularities,

By the same token the curl of the output vector ﬁeld of a SHWS, shown in Eq. (6), gives
us, according to Eq. (8), a distribution of singularities, showing us where they are located
and what their topological charges are. One can easily compute D(x, y), as shown in Eq. (6),
from G and then use the result to identify the phase singularities in the wavefront.

In the above discussion we assumed the ideal case, which ignores the eﬀects of the discrete-
ness and ﬁnite size of the subapertures of the SHWS. In the following section we consider
the SHWS more carefully. We’ll see that the subaperture size sets a scale beneath which
singularities become unobservable and it also modiﬁes the weight of 2π with which each
singularities is multiplied.

3. Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor

The SHWS uses a lenslet array to sample the wavefront, as shown in Fig. 1. The slope of
the wavefront for each of these samples is given by the location of the focal point formed
by each lenslet in its back focal plane. To simplify our analysis we’ll assume that the lenslet
array is a square array of lenslets, each with a square shaped subaperture, as shown in Fig. 2.
A detector array is placed in the back focal plane of the lenslet array. A small subarray of
this detector array is dedicated to each lenslet of the lenslet array. This subarray is used to
determine the location of the focal point produced by each lenslet. The location of the focal
point for the (m, n)-th subaperture (lenslet) is given by a position vector um,n that is given
by the centroid of the measured intensity distribution in the back focal plane,

um,n =

m,n would be the location of the focal point for a normally incident plane wave;
where u0
I(u) is the intensity distribution over the detector plane; H is the window of the subarray
of detectors on the detector plane; and d2u is the two-dimensional integration measure on
the detector plane.

The average phase slope for each subaperture is given by the location of the focal point,
as determined by the intensity centroid in Eq. (9). This relationship follows from the Fourier
relationship, as portrayed in Fig. 3, between the phase tilt of the incident wave in front of a
lens and the location of the resulting focal point behind it. So the average phase slope over
the (m, n)-th subaperture can be expressed as

θ(x) is the gradient of the phase function of the incident wave; x denotes the two-

dimensional position vector on the lenslet plane; k(= 2π/λ) is the wave number; f is the
focal length of the lenslets; Ω is the area of the lenslet subaperture; and um,n is the location
of the (m, n)-th focal point on the detector plane, as deﬁned in Eq. (9). The Gm,n-values
given by Eq. (10) represent the sampled output vector ﬁeld of the SHWS. Each value is
associated with a point in the center of the particular subaperture, as denoted by the dots
in Fig. 2.

4. Detection of phase singularities

In the previous section we saw that the output of the SHWS in a practical adaptive optical
system is a sampled vector ﬁeld G with each sample representing the averaged phase slopes
over one subaperture. The solenoidal part of this vector ﬁeld contains the information about
the locations of the singularities, as pointed out in Section 2. To extract this information from

5

the sampled vector ﬁeld, one needs to implement the curl operation of Eq. (6) numerically.
Such a numerical implementation is equivalent to the line integral of Eq. (4). The numerical
computation is done by computing what we refer to as the circulation, given by,

Dm,n =

where w is the subaperture window size and the superscript m, n denotes the subaperture
index. The physical implementation of the circulation process is presented in Fig. 4. The
samples used in the calculation are denoted by the points in the centers of the subapertures
shown in Fig. 4. The circulation represents a line integral performed over the four subaper-
tures along a contour denoted by the dashed-line. Note that the result of this circulation
operation represents a value D that should be associated with a point in the center of the
four subapertures. However, we are assigning it the same index m, n that is associated with
the upper left subaperture.

The result of this computation Dm,n is a distribution of the topological charges of the phase
singularities. It is positive (negative) at the locations of phase singularities with positive
(negative) topological charges and it should be zero where there are no phase singularities.
However, this distribution is aﬀected by the averaging process, the sampled nature of the
data and, of course, noise. As a result the values are not exactly zero when there are no
singularities. Moreover, the value of Dm,n at the location of a single positive singularity is
not 2π as one would expect if the circulation is an exact implementation of the line integral
Eq. (4). In the next two subsections, we analyze the eﬀects of the practical implementation
of the singularity detection procedure.

4.A. Canonical phase singularities

Here we consider the situation where a canonical singularity is located in the center of the
four subapertures, as shown by point A in Fig. 4. We deﬁne the origin (0, 0) of our coordinate
system at this point. The complex amplitude function of a canonical phase singularity at the
iφ), where the sign indicates the topological
origin can be expressed as (x
±
charge of the singularity and r and φ are respectively the radial coordinate and the azimuthal
coordinate. Here we consider a positively charged singularity. The phase function of the
singularity is simply the azimuthal coordinate φ, provided that the singularity is located at
the origin. The gradient of the phase function of a canonical phase singularity can then be
expressed in Cartesian coordinates, as,

iy)/r = exp(

Substituting Eq. (12) into Eq. (10), we obtain an analytical expression for the average phase

(13)

The integration boundaries are determined by the location of the (m, n)-th subaperture
within the four subaperture area shown in Fig. 4. Due to the symmetry of the phase func-
tion of a canonical singularity at the origin, the average phase slope values for the other
subapertures will be the same apart from a possible change in sign. Then, according to
Eqs. (11) and (13), the value for Dm,n will be,

Dm,n = 4wGm,n

x = π + 2 ln(2) = 4.527887.

(14)

We note that the value of the circulation is π + 2 ln 2 and not the 2π that one ﬁnds for
the analytical case given by Eq. (4). It is the averaging process that is responsible for this
diﬀerence and not the ﬁnite diﬀerences of the calculation process. One ﬁnds that if the same
ﬁnite diﬀerence circulation calculation, Eq. (11), is performed on a sampled gradient function
of a canonical phase singularity without the averaging process the result is indeed 2π.

Although it is the averaging process that causes the diﬀerence, we note that this circulation
value is independent of the subaperture window size w. This is because the phase function of
a singularity is scale invariant. So the diﬀerence is produced simply because some averaging
takes place, but it does not matter how big the subapertures are over which the slopes are
averaged.

When the singularity is not located at the origin, in the center of the four apertures, but
at some other location such as the position B at (x0, y0) in Fig. 4, we can expect the value of
the circulation to change. The expression for the gradient of the phase function now becomes

Using Eq. (15) and Eq. (10), one can compute the average phase slopes G for the four
subapertures. Then, with the aid of Eq. (11), one can compute Dm,n. The ﬁnal expression
is rather complicated. It can be obtained from the more general expression for arbitrary
morphology provided in Appendix A, as explained there.

The circulation D is shown in Fig. 5 as a function of the location of the singularity in
terms of normalized coordinates µ = x0/w and ν = y0/w. A topview of this function over the

with the value D = 4.53, consistent with Eq. (14). Away from the origin the value of D

The fact that the circulation function never becomes exactly zero implies that the existence
of a singularity at some point in the output plane gives nonzero circulation values in all other
parts of the output plane.

In view of the fact that the peak value of the circulation function is π + 2 ln(2) instead of
2π, it is interesting to note that, if one would add the four sample values of Dm,n closest to
the location of a singularity – i.e. the four values that surround the singularity – then the
result is closer to 2π.

4.B. Noncanonical phase singularities

Singularities in strongly scintillated beams are in general noncanonical. It is therefore nec-
essary to know how the computation of the circulation is aﬀected by the morphology of the
singularity. The phase function of a singularity with an arbitrary morphology is given by
Eqs. (2) and (3). The gradient of this phase function can be expressed by,

to any location (x0, y0) by replacing x

We use the same procedure that was use in Subsection 4.A to analyze the noncanonical
case. We use Eq. (10) to compute the output of the SHWS for the phase gradient given
in Eq. (17), shifted to (x0, y0). Then we substitute the result into Eq. (11) to compute the
circulation D. In Appendix A we provide the complete expression of this circulation function
for a singularity with an arbitrary morphology, located at an arbitrary point (in normalized
coordinate µ = x0/w and ν = y0/w) within the four subapertures, shown in Fig. 4.

π). At α = π/2 there is a discrete jump, which represents the change in the topological
charge of the singularity. The fact that there is such a large diﬀerence between the values
on either side of the jump, indicates that the circulation D, calculated from the output
of SHWS, can in principle determine the topological charge of a singularity even if it is
severely anisotropic. However, in a practical situation, singularities tend to have such severe
anisotropic morphologies only when they appear in oppositely charged pairs close to each
other. In such situations their circulation values will in general partially cancel each other,
making them diﬃcult to identify. Near the jump at α = π/2 the value of D has its greatest
ﬂuctuation as a function of β. Next to the jump D ﬂuctuates between π and 2π. When α
approaches the canonical values of 0 or π the value of D tend towards its canonical peak
value of 4.53 and the ﬂuctuations as a function of β diminish.

2 < µ < 2 and

In Figs. 7 and 8 we provide plots of D over the region

2 < ν < 2, for
two diﬀerent morphologies of the singularity. First we consider the case when α = π/4 and
β = π. This represents a singularity with a moderate anisotropy oriented along the y-axis.
The topview of the circulation function for this case is shown in Fig. 7(a) and the shape of
the circulation function is shown in Fig. 7(b) in terms of three one-dimensional functions:
along ν = 0 (µ-line), along µ = 0 (ν-line) and along the line where ν = µ (diagonal line).
The peak value at the origin is about 4.5. The function then decreases toward zero away
from the origin. We note that the shape of the circulation function is more anisotropic than
the shape in Fig. 5 in that the respective widths of the peak along the µ- and ν-directions
are not equal. There are still regions where the function becomes negative.

Next we consider the case where α = 4π/9 and β = π/2. This represents a highly
anisotropic singularity oriented diagonally along the line where ν =
µ. We show the topview
of the circulation function for this case in Fig. 7(a) and the shape of the circulation function
in Fig. 7(b) in terms of three one-dimensional functions: along ν = 0 (middle line), along
the line where ν = µ (diagonal-I line) and along the line where ν =
µ (diagonal-II line).
The peak value at the origin is now about 5. The function decreases away from the origin,
but the decrease is much slower along the orientation of the singularity. The shape of the
circulation function is therefore much more anisotropic.

5. Numerical simulation

Here we present a numerical simulation to test the singularity detection procedure that was
analytically investigated in the previous sections. We simulate the propagation of a Gaussian
beam over a distance of 100 km through a turbulent atmosphere. We use the well known
numerical method of Ref. 17 to perform the simulation. The strength of the turbulence is
10−18 m2/3 and we use 10 equally spaced phase screens to
parameterized with C 2
simulate the 10 km thick turbulent layers. This method provides a reasonable agreement

n = 4

between real world data and the simulation data. The phase of the beam is distorted when
it reaches the system aperture and in our example we ﬁnd four phase singularities in the
wavefront, as shown in Fig. 9(a). This beam then passes through our simulated SHWS,
from which we obtain the sampled vector ﬁeld G, computed with Eq. (10). The circulation
function D is then computed with Eq. (11). The resulting circulation function is shown in
Fig. 9(b). Two of the singularities, one positive and one negative, are easily identiﬁed from
3.54, in the lower-left corner of Fig. 9(a).
their respective circulation values of 2.95 and
Note that the magnitudes of both these values are smaller than 2π. This would be due to
a combination of the fact that the singularities have noncanonical morphologies, the fact
they are not located at the ideal location in the center of four subapertures and noise that is
present in the phase function. Integrating over a 3
3 neighborhood around these singularities
we obtain values of 6.20 and

×
5.86, respectively, which are closer to

2π.

−

−

±

The other two singularities in the upper-right corner of Fig. 9(a) are much closer to
each other. Therefore, their individual circulation functions overlap and, having opposite
topological charges, they partially cancel each other. As a result the circulation peaks that
represent these singularities are severely diminished. For example, the positive peak for this
pair of singularities in Fig. 9(b) has a value of only 1.41. Oppositely charged singularities
that are located closer to each other are therefore more diﬃcult to detect.

6. Conclusion

The phase gradient that is produced as output of a SHWS contains information about the
continuous phase function of the incident wave, but also of the phase singularities in the
wavefront. A least-squares projector11–14 can be used to extract the information about the
continuous phase and can be used to correct contious phase distortions. The information
about the singularities is contained in the solenoidal part of the phase gradient. The curl
of this part gives a topological charges distribution, which represents the locations and
topological charges of the singularities. Theoretically each positive (negative) singularity
should be indicated by a value of 2π (

2π) in the topological charge distribution.

The averaging process inherent to the SHWS has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the computed
topological charge distribution. Instead of the theoretical value of 2π, the actual value that
is produced is at most about 4.53. The precise location of the singularity relative to the
subapertures in the SHWS, as well as the morphology of the singularity produce further
variations in the value of the topological charge distribution at the location of a singularity.
Nevertheless, these values are generally large enough to identify an isolated singularity. It
is therefore possible to extract the information of the location and topological charge of the
singularities from the output obtained from a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor.

−

In the analytical investigation presented here we only considered one singularity. In the

10

numerical simulation we found that when diﬀerent oppositely charged singularities are in
close proximity to each other, their respective topological charge distributions, as produced
by the circulation computations, would overlap, causing partial cancelation and a subsequent
reduction in their peaks. This makes detection of these singularities more diﬃcult. Further
investigation is needed to understand the eﬀect of multiple singularities located near each
other on the detection process.

The phase functions of scintillated optical beams are in general noisy. The noise becomes
larger as the scintillation increases. The analysis that is provided here does not speciﬁcally
include such noise. It is expected that the ability to detect singularities would deteriorate as
the noise is increased. This is an important aspect that still needs to be investigated.

Fig. 1 One-dimensional representation of a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor.

Fig. 2 An array of subapertures (small squares) within the system aperture of the SHWS.

The average phase slope values are associated with the dots inside the small squares.

Fig. 3 One-dimensional representation of one lenslet in the SHWS, showing the shift of

the focal point due to the average tilt of the incident wavefront.

Fig. 4 Circulation Dm,n over four subapertures with a singularity located either at the
center (assumed to be the origin), denoted by A or at some arbitrary location (x0, y0)
denoted by B. The four subapertures are represented by the four squares. The dot at the
center of each subaperture is the position with which the average phase slope value G of
that subaperture is associated. The arrows represent the components of G. The dashed-lines
represent the contour used for calculation of the circulation.

Fig. 5 Circulation D for a canonical singularity. A topview of D is shown in (a) as a
function of the relative position of the singularity inside the four subaperture area, shown
2 < ν < 2. One-dimensional functions of D are plotted as
in Fig. 4, for
functions of r = √µ2 + ν2 in (b) along the ‘diagonal line’ and ‘middle line,’ respectively, as
indicated in (a).

Abstract

We study the classical scattering problem of a plane electromagnetic wave incident on the sur-

face of semi-inﬁnite periodic stratiﬁed media incorporating anisotropic dielectric layers with special

oblique orientation of the anisotropy axes. We demonstrate that an obliquely incident light, upon

entering the periodic slab, gets converted into an abnormal grazing mode with huge amplitude and

zero normal component of the group velocity. This mode cannot be represented as a superposition

of extended and evanescent contributions. Instead, it is related to a general (non-Bloch) Floquet

eigenmode with the amplitude diverging linearly with the distance from the slab boundary. Re-

markably, the slab reﬂectivity in such a situation can be very low, which means an almost 100%

conversion of the incident light into the axially frozen mode with the electromagnetic energy den-

sity exceeding that of the incident wave by several orders of magnitude. The eﬀect can be realized

at any desirable frequency, including optical and UV frequency range. The only essential physical

requirement is the presence of dielectric layers with proper oblique orientation of the anisotropy

axes. Some practical aspects of this phenomenon are considered.

INTRODUCTION

Electromagnetic properties of periodic stratiﬁed media have been a subject of extensive

research for decades (see, for example, [1, 2, 3] and references therein). Of particular interest

has been the case of periodic stacks (1D photonic crystals) made up of lossless dielectric com-

ponents with diﬀerent refractive indices. Photonic crystals with one-dimensional periodicity

had been widely used in optics long before the term ”photonic crystals” was invented.

Let us look at the classical problem of a plane electromagnetic wave incident on the

surface of semi-inﬁnite plane-parallel periodic array, as shown in Fig. 1. The well known

are the energy density ﬂuxes of the incident, reﬂected and transmitted waves, respectively. The

transmitted wave ΨT is a superposition of two Bloch eigenmodes, each of which can be either

extended or evanescent. Only extended modes can transfer the energy in the z direction.

eﬀects of the slab periodicity are: (i) the possibility of omnidirectional reﬂectance when

the incident radiation is reﬂected by the slab, regardless of the angle of incidence; (ii) the
possibility of negative refraction , when the tangential component of the energy ﬂux ~ST of

transmitted wave is antiparallel to that of the incident wave; (iii) dramatic slowdown of the

transmitted wave near photonic band edge frequency, where the normal component of the
transmitted wave group velocity ~u vanishes along with the respective energy ﬂux ~ST . The

extensive discussion on the subject and numerous references can be found in [4, 5, 6, 7,

8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. All the above eﬀects can occur even in the simplest case of a semi-

2

inﬁnite periodic array of two isotropic dielectric materials with diﬀerent refractive indices,

for example, glass and air. The majority of known photonic crystals fall into this category.

The introduction of dielectric anisotropy, however, can bring qualitatively new features to

electromagnetic properties of periodic stratiﬁed media and open up new opportunities for

practical applications (see, for example, a recent publication [14]). One of such phenomena

is the subject of this work.

A. The Axially Frozen Mode (AFM)

Consider a semi-inﬁnite periodic stack with at least one of the constituents being an

anisotropic dielectric material with oblique orientation of anisotropic axis. A simple example

of such an array is presented in Fig. 2. We will show that under certain physical conditions, a

monochromatic plane wave incident on the semi-inﬁnite slab is converted into an abnormal

electromagnetic mode with huge amplitude and nearly tangential energy density ﬂux, as

illustrated in Fig. 3. Such a wave will be referred to as the Axially Frozen Mode (AFM).

The use of this term is justiﬁed because the normal (axial) component uz of the respective

group velocity becomes vanishingly small, while the amplitude of the AFM can exceed the

amplitude of the incident plane wave by several orders of magnitude.

The group velocity ~u of the AFM is parallel to the semi-inﬁnite slab boundary and,

therefore, the magnitude of the tangential component

of the respective energy density

ﬂux ~ST is overwhelmingly larger than the magnitude of the normal component

. But,

, the normal component

of the energy density ﬂux inside

the slab is still comparable with that of the incident plane wave in vacuum. This property

persists even if the normal component uz of the wave group velocity inside the slab vanishes,

The qualitative explanation for this is that the inﬁnitesimally small value of uz is oﬀset

by huge magnitude of the energy density W in the AFM. As the result, the product uzW ,
~ST

which determines the normal component

of the energy ﬂux, remains ﬁnite. The

above behavior is totally diﬀerent from what happens in the vicinity of a photonic band

edge, where the normal component uz of the wave group velocity vanishes too. Indeed, let

In line with Eq. (1), in the AFM regime the transmittance τ remains signiﬁcant and can be

(cid:16)

even close to unity, as shown in an example in Fig. 4(a). In other words, the incident plane

wave enters the slab with little reﬂectance, where it turns into an abnormal AFM with

inﬁnitesimally small normal component of the group velocity, huge amplitude, and huge

tangential component of the energy density ﬂux. By contrast, in the vicinity of a photonic

band edge (at frequencies near ω = ωb in Fig. 4(a)), the transmittance of semi-inﬁnite slab

always vanishes, along with the normal component uz of the wave group velocity.

FIG. 4: (a) The transmittance τ of periodic semi-inﬁnite slab vs. frequency at ﬁxed direction ~n of

the incidence. At the frequency ω0 of the AFM, τ is close to unity, which implies that the incident

wave almost completely gets converted into the AFM. (b) The respective axial dispersion relation

ω (kz) at ﬁxed (nx, ny) from Eq. (12). At kz = k0 and ω = ω0 this spectral branch develops a

stationary inﬂection point (16) associated with the AFM regime. ωb is the edge of the frequency

band for a given (nx, ny). The values of ω and k are expressed in units of c/L and 1/L, respectively.

It turns out that at a given frequency ω0 the AFM regime can occur only for a special

direction ~n0 of the incident plane wave propagation

~n0 = ~n0 (ω0) .

5

(3)

This special direction of incidence always makes an oblique angle with the normal z to the

layers. To ﬁnd ~n0 for a given ω0 or, conversely, to ﬁnd ω0 for a given ~n0, one has to solve

the Maxwell equations in the periodic stratiﬁed medium. This problem will be addressed in

Section 3. In Section 2 we consider the relation between the AFM regime and the singularity

of the electromagnetic dispersion relation responsible for such a peculiar behavior. If the

frequency ω and the direction of incidence ~n do not match explicitly as prescribed by Eq.

(3), the AFM regime will be somewhat smeared.

B. The vicinity of the AFM regime

Let ΨT (z) be the transmitted electromagnetic ﬁeld inside the semi-inﬁnite slab (the

explicit deﬁnition of ΨT (z) is given in Eqs. (38) and (88)). It turns out that in the vicinity of

the AFM regime, ΨT (z) is a superposition of the extended and evanescent Bloch eigenmodes

ΨT (z) = Ψex (z) + Ψev (z) , z > 0,

(4)

where Ψex (z) is an extended mode with uz > 0, and Ψev (z) is an evanescent mode with

kz > 0. As shown in an example in Fig. 5, both the contributions to ΨT (z) have huge and

ℑ
nearly equal and opposite values near the slab boundary, so that their superposition (4) at

z = 0 is small enough to satisfy the boundary condition (90). As the distance z from the

slab boundary increases, the evanescent component Ψev (z) decays exponentially, while the

amplitude of the extended component Ψex (z) remains constant and huge. As the result, the

perfect plane monochromatic wave.

Hence, in the vicinity of the AFM regime, the transmitted (refracted) electromagnetic wave

can be viewed as a grazing mode. The most important and unique feature of this grazing

mode directly relates to the fact that the transmittance τ of the semi-inﬁnite slab remains

density ﬂux in the transmitted wave are much larger than the respective values in the incident

wave. However, the total power transmitted by the refracted wave is smaller by factor τ , due to

much smaller cross-section area of the nearly grazing transmitted wave.

where we have taken into account that τ SI cos θI is limited (of the order of magnitude of

unity) as ω

ω0. By contrast, in the vicinity of the photonic band edge the transmittance

τ of the semi-inﬁnite slab vanishes along with the energy density ﬂux ST of the transmitted

→

(refracted) wave.

The expressions (7) and (11) show that in the vicinity of the AFM regime, the transmitted

wave behaves like a grazing mode with huge and nearly tangential energy density ﬂux ST

and very small (compared to that of the incident beam) cross-section area AT , so that the

total power UT = AT ST associated with the transmitted wave cannot exceed the total power
UI of the incident wave: UT = τ UI ≤

UI .

The above qualitative consideration is only valid on the scales exceeding the size L of

the unit cell (which is of the order of magnitude of c/ω) and more importantly, exceeding
1 from the slab boundary where the evanescent mode

the transitional distance l = (

kev)−

ℑ

contribution to the resulting electromagnetic ﬁeld ΨT (z) is still signiﬁcant. The latter

means that the width of both the incident and the refracted beams must be much larger

than l. If the above condition is not met, we cannot treat the transmitted wave as a beam,

and the expressions (7) through (11) do not apply.

Instead, we would have to use the

explicit electrodynamic expressions for ΨT (z), such as the asymptotic formula (101). Note

that if the direction ~n of the incident wave propagation and the frequency ω exactly match

the condition (3) for the AFM regime, the transmitted wave ΨT (z) does not reduce to

a superposition (4) of canonical Bloch eigenmodes.

Instead, the AFM is described by a

general Floquet eigenmode Ψ01 (z) from Eq. (80), which diverges inside the slab as z, until

the nonlinear eﬀects or other limiting factors come into play. The related mathematical

analysis is provided in Sections 3 and 4.

9

In some respects, the remarkable behavior of the AFM, is similar to that of the frozen

mode related to the phenomenon of electromagnetic unidirectionality in nonreciprocal mag-

netic photonic crystals [15, 16]. In a unidirectional photonic crystal, electromagnetic radia-

tion of a certain frequency ω0 can propagate with ﬁnite group velocity ~u

z only in one of the

k

two opposite directions, say, from right to left. The problem with the electromagnetic uni-

directionality, though, is that it essentially requires the presence of magnetic materials with

strong circular birefringence (Faraday rotation) and low losses at the frequency range of in-

terest. Such materials are readily available at the microwave frequencies, but at the infrared

and optical frequency ranges, ﬁnding appropriate magnetic materials is highly problematic.

Thus, at frequencies above 1012 Hz, the electromagnetic unidirectionality along with the

respective nonreciprocal magnetic mechanism of the frozen mode formation may prove to be

impractical. By contrast, the occurrence of AFM does not require the presence of magnetic

or any other essentially dispersive components in the periodic stack. Therefore, the AFM

regime can be realized at any frequencies, including the infrared, optical, and even ultraviolet

frequency ranges. The only essential physical requirement is the presence of anisotropic di-

electric layers with proper orientation of the anisotropy axes. An example of such an array

is shown in Fig. 2.

In Section 2 we establish the relation between the phenomenon of AFM and the electro-

magnetic dispersion relation of the periodic layered medium. This allows us to formulate

strict and simple symmetry conditions for such a phenomenon to occur, as well as to ﬁnd

out what kind of periodic stratiﬁed media can exhibit the eﬀect. Relevant theoretical anal-

ysis based on the Maxwell equations in stratiﬁed media is carried out in Sections 3 and 4.

Finally, in Section 5 we discuss some practical aspects of the phenomenon.

II. DISPERSION RELATION WITH THE AFM

Now we establish the connection between the phenomenon of AFM and the electromag-

netic dispersion relation ω
In a
plane-parallel stratiﬁed slab, the tangential components (kx, ky) of the Bloch wave vector ~k

, ~k = (kx, ky, kz) of the periodic stratiﬁed medium.

~k
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

always coincide with those of the incident plane wave in Figs. 1, 3, and 6 while the normal

component kz is diﬀerent from that of the incident wave. To avoid confusion, in further
consideration, the z component of the Bloch wave vector ~k inside the periodic slab will be

10

denoted as k without the subscript z, namely

Inside periodic stack:

~k = (kx, ky, k).

The value of k is found by solving the Maxwell equations in the periodic stratiﬁed medium

for given ω and (kx, ky); k is deﬁned up to a multiple of 2π/L, where L is the period of the

layered structure.

Consider now the frequency ω as function of k for ﬁxed (kx, ky). A typical example of

such a dependence is shown in Fig. 7(a). A large gap at the lowest frequencies is determined
by the value of the ﬁxed tangential components (kx, ky) of the quasimomentum ~k. This gap

vanishes in the case of normal incidence, when kx = ky = 0. An alternative and more

convenient representation for the dispersion relation is presented in Fig. 7(b), where the

plot of ω(k) is obtained for ﬁxed (nx, ny) based on

(nx, ny) = (ckx/ω, cky/ω).

(12)

The pair of values (nx, ny) coincide with the tangential components of the unit vector ~n

deﬁning the direction of the incident plane wave propagation. The dependence ω(k) for

ﬁxed (nx, ny) or for ﬁxed (kx, ky) will be referred to as the axial dispersion relation.

Suppose that for ~k = ~k0 and ω = ω0 = ω

, one of the spectral branches ω (k) develops

a stationary inﬂection point for given (kx, ky) = (k0x, k0y), i.e.,

The partial derivatives in Eqs. (16) are taken at constant (nx, ny), rather than at constant

In Fig. 4(b) we reproduced an enlarged fragment of the upper spectral branch of the axial

dispersion relation in Fig. 7(b). For the chosen (nx, ny), this branch develops a stationary

inﬂection point (16) at ω = ω0 and k = k0. The extended Bloch eigenmode with ω = ω0
and ~k = ~k0, associated with the stationary inﬂection point, turns out to be directly related
to the axially frozen mode (AFM).

In Sections 3 and 4, based on the Maxwell equations, we prove that the singularity (16)

(or, equivalently, (13)) indeed leads to the very distinct AFM regime in the semi-inﬁnite

periodic stack. We also show that a necessary condition for such a singularity and, therefore,

a necessary condition for the AFM existence is the following property of the axial dispersion

relation of the periodic stack

ω (kx, ky, k)

= ω (kx, ky,

k) or, equivalently, ω (nx, ny, k)

= ω (nx, ny,

k)

(17)

This property will be referred to as the axial spectral asymmetry. Evidently, the axial

dispersion relations presented in Fig. 7, satisfy this criterion. Leaving the proof of the

above statements to Section 3, let us look at the constraints imposed by the criterion (17)

on the geometry and composition of the periodic stack.

A. Conditions for the axial spectral asymmetry

First of all, notice that a periodic array would deﬁnitely have an axially symmetric dis-

persion relation

Consequently, a necessary condition for the axial spectral asymmetry (17) of a periodic stack

is the absence of the symmetry operations (19), i.e.,

1. Application of the criterion (21) to deferent periodic stacks.

The condition (21) for the axial spectral asymmetry imposes certain restrictions on the

geometry and composition of the periodic stratiﬁed medium, as well as on the direction of

the incident wave propagation.

that a common periodic stack made up of isotropic dielectric components with diﬀerent

refractive indices, always has axially symmetric dispersion relation (18), no matter how

complicated the periodic array is or how many diﬀerent isotropic materials are involved. To

prove this, it suﬃces to note that such a stack always supports the symmetry operation 2z.

In fact, the symmetry operation 2z holds in the more general case when all the layers are

either isotropic, or have a purely in-plane anisotropy

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

Obviously, the in-plane anisotropy (23) does not remove the symmetry operation 2z and,

therefore, the property (18) of the axial spectral symmetry holds in this case. Thus, we

can state that in order to display the axial spectral asymmetry, the periodic stack must

include at least one anisotropic component, either uniaxial or biaxial. In addition, one of

the principle axes of the respective dielectric permittivity tensor ˆε must make an oblique

angle with the normal to the layers, which means that at least one of the two components

εxz and εyz of the respective dielectric tensor must be nonzero.

The above requirement gives us a simple and useful idea on what kind of periodic stratiﬁed

media can support the axial spectral asymmetry and the AFM regime. But this is not a

substitute for the stronger symmetry criterion (20) or (21). For example, although the

periodic stack in Fig. 8 includes the A layers identical to those in Fig. 2, this stack does

supports the mirror plane mz, which, according to the expression (19), ensures the axial

spectral symmetry.

the simple requirement

b. Restriction on the direction of incident wave propagation Consider now an impor-

tant particular case kx = ky = 0 of the normal incidence. The criterion (17) reduces now to

of the bulk spectral asymmetry, which is prohibited in nonmagnetic photonic crystals due

to the time reversal symmetry. Therefore, in the nonmagnetic case, we have the following

incident plane wave, i.e., the incident angle must be oblique.

Conditions (21) and (25) may not be necessary in the case of nonreciprocal magnetic

stacks (see the details in [15]). But as we mentioned earlier, at frequencies above 1012

Hz, the nonreciprocal eﬀects in common nonconducting materials are negligible. Therefore,

in order to have a robust AFM regime in the infrared or optical frequency range, we must

satisfy both requirements (21) and (25), regardless of whether or not nonreciprocal magnetic

materials are involved.

As soon as the above conditions are met, one can always achieve the AFM regime at

any desirable frequency ω within certain frequency range ∆ω. The frequency range ∆ω is

determined by the stack geometry and the dielectric materials used, while a speciﬁc value

of ω within the range can be selected by the direction ~n of the light incidence.

B. Periodic stack with two layers in unit cell

The simplest and the most practical example of a periodic stack supporting the axial

spectral asymmetry (17) and, thereby, the AFM regime, is shown in Fig. 2. It is made up of

anisotropic A layers alternated with isotropic B layers. The respective dielectric permittivity

tensors are

with the mirror plane my normal to the y - axis. Such a symmetry is compatible with the

necessary condition (21) for the AFM existence. But as we will see below, the symmetry

possibilities, diﬀerent in terms of symmetry.

In the case (a) of normal incidence, when nx = ny = 0, the dispersion relation is axially

symmetric, as must be the case with any reciprocal periodic stratiﬁed medium (see the

In the case (b), when nx = 0 and ny 6

= 0, the two necessary conditions (21) and (25)

for the axial spectral asymmetry are met. Yet, those conditions prove not to be suﬃcient.

Indeed, if nx = 0, either of the symmetry operations

imposes the relation

(29)

(30)

which implies the axial spectral symmetry. Neither stationary inﬂection point, nor AFM

can occur in this case.

In the case (c), when nx 6
quasimomentum ~k lies now in the x

= 0 and ny = 0, the situation is more complicated. The

z plane, which coincides with the mirror plane my.

Therefore, every Bloch eigenmode Ψ~k (z) can be classiﬁed as a pure TE or pure TM mode,
depending on the Ψ~k (z) parity with respect to the mirror reﬂection my

for TE mode myΨ~k (z) =

Ψ~k (z) ;

for TM mode: myΨ~k (z) = Ψ~k (z) .

(31)

−

The TE modes have axially symmetric dispersion relation

for TE modes: ω (kx, 0, k) = ω (kx, 0,

k) .

(32)

−

−

Indeed, the component εxz of the dielectric tensor ˆεA does not aﬀect the TE modes, because

in this case the electric component E(r, t) of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is parallel to the y

axis. As a consequence, the axial dispersion relation of the TE spectral branches is similar

to that of the isotropic case with εxz = 0, where it is always symmetric. By contrast, for the

TM modes we have E(r, t)

y. Therefore, the TM modes are aﬀected by εxz and display

axially asymmetric dispersion relation

⊥

for TM modes: ω (kx, 0, k)

= ω (kx, 0,

k) ,

(33)

as seen in Fig. 9(c). We wish to remark, though, that the equality (32) cannot be derived

from symmetry arguments only. The axial spectral symmetry of the TE modes is not exact

and relies on the approximation (27) for the magnetic permeability of the A layers. On

the other hand, the fact that the spectral branches have diﬀerent parity (31) with respect

to the symmetry operation my, implies that none of the branches can develop a stationary

18

6
inﬂection point (see Eq. (83) and explanations thereafter). Thus, in the case ny = 0, in

spite of the axial spectral asymmetry, the AFM regime cannot occur either.

Finally, in the general case (d ), when nx 6

= 0 and ny 6

= 0, all the spectral branches display

the property (17) of the axial spectral asymmetry. In addition, the Bloch eigenmodes now

are of the same symmetry (i. e., belong to the same irreducible representation of the wave

vector symmetry group) and are neither TE, nor TM. This is exactly the case when the

AFM regime can be achieved at some frequencies by proper choice of the incident angle.

For instance, if we impose the equality nx = ny and change the incident angle only, it turns

out that every single spectral branch at some point develops a stationary inﬂection point

(16) and, thereby, displays the AFM at the respective frequency. If we want the AFM at a

speciﬁed frequency ω0, then we will have to adjust both nx and ny.

Notice that in the case of normal incidence, the Maxwell operator is drastically simpliﬁed

for nx = ny = 0.

This is the case we dealt with in [16] when considering the phenomenon of electromagnetic

unidirectionality in nonreciprocal magnetic photonic crystals. By contrast, the objective of

(39)

(40)

this Section is to show how the terms M11 and M22, occurring only in the case of oblique

incidence, can lead to the phenomenon of AFM, regardless of whether or not the nonrecip-

rocal eﬀects are present. Note that M11 and M22 are also nonzero in materials with linear

magnetoelectric eﬀect (see, for example, Ref. 15 and references therein), but we are not

considering here such an exotic situation.

Diﬀerent versions of the reduced Maxwell equation (38) can be found in the extensive

literature on electrodynamics of stratiﬁed media (see, for example, [17, 18, 19], and references

therein). For more detailed studies of J - Hermitian and J - unitary operators see [20].

B. The transfer matrix

The Cauchy problem

∂zΨ (z) = i

M (z) Ψ (z) , Ψ (z0) = Ψ0

for the reduced Maxwell equation (38) has a unique solution

Ψ (z) = T (z, z0) Ψ (z0)

where the 4

4 matrix T (z, z0) is so-called transfer matrix. From the deﬁnition (45) of the

×

transfer matrix it follows that

T (z, z0) = T (z, z′) T (z′, z0) , T (z, z0) = T −

1 (z0, z) , T (z, z) = I.

(46)

The matrix T (z, z0) is uniquely deﬁned by the following Cauchy problem

∂zT (z, z0) = i

M (z) T (z, z0) , T (z, z) = I.

The equation (47), together with J - Hermitivity (42) of the Maxwell operator M (z), imply

that the matrix T (z, z0) is J - unitarity, i.e.,

T † (z, z0) = JT −

1 (z, z0) J.

(see the proof in Appendix 1). The J - unitarity (48) of the transfer matrix imposes strong

constraints on its eigenvalues (see Eq. (61)). It also implies that

The transfer matrix TS of a stack of layers is a sequential product of the transfer matrices

Tm of the constitutive layers

If the individual layers are homogeneous, the corresponding single-layer transfer matrices

Tm are explicitly expressed in terms of the respective Maxwell operators Mm

= 1.

TS =

Tm

Tm = exp (izmMm)

where zm is the thickness of the m-th layer. The explicit expression for Mm is given by

(39). Thus, formula (50), together with (51) and (39), gives us an explicit expression for

the transfer matrix TS of an arbitrary stack of anisotropic dielectric layers. TS is a function

of (i) the material tensors ˆε and ˆµ in each layer of the stack, (ii) the layer thicknesses, (iii)

the frequency ω, and (iv) the tangential components (kx, ky) = (nxω/c, nyω/c) of the wave

vector.

Consider the important particular case of normal wave propagation. Using Eq. (51) and

the explicit expression (39) for the Maxwell operator, one can prove that

det (TS) = 1,

for nx = ny = 0.

(52)

Additional information related to the transfer matrix formalism can be found in [17, 18,

19] and references therein.

C. Periodic arrays. Bloch eigenmodes.

In a periodic layered structure, all material tensors, along with the J - Hermitian matrix

M(z) in Eq. (38), are periodic functions of z

M (z + L) = M (z)

(53)

22

where L is the length of a primitive cell of the periodic stack. By deﬁnition, Bloch solutions

Ψk (z) of the reduced Maxwell equation (38) with the periodic operator M(z) satisfy

Ψk (z + L) = eikLΨk (z)

The deﬁnition (45) of the T - matrix together with Eq. (54) give

Ψk (z + L) = T (z + L, z) Ψk (z) = eikLΨk (z) .

Introducing the transfer matrix of a primitive cell

TL = T (L, 0)

we have from Eq. (55)

TLΦk = eikLΦk, where Φk = Ψk (0) .

Thus, the eigenvectors of the transfer matrix TL of the unit cell are uniquely related to the

eigenmodes of the reduced Maxwell equation (38) through the relations

Φk1 = Ψk1 (0) , Φk2 = Ψk2 (0) , Φk3 = Ψk3 (0) , Φk4 = Ψk4 (0)

(58)

The respective four eigenvalues

Xi = eikiL, i = 1, 2, 3, 4

(59)

of TL are the roots of the characteristic equation

F (X) = 0, where F (X) = det

= X 4 + P3X 3 + P2X 2 + P1X + 1.

relates to the case of two extended and two evanescent modes. The last possibility

D. Stationary inﬂection point

The coeﬃcients of the characteristic polynomial F (X) in Eq. (60) are functions of ω

and (kx, ky). Let F0 (X) be the characteristic polynomial at the stationary inﬂection point

(16), where ω = ω0 and (kx, ky) = (k0x, k0y). The stationary inﬂection point (16) can also

be deﬁned as follows

F0 (X) = 0, F ′0 (X) = 0, F ′′0 (X) = 0, F ′′′0 (X)

= 0.

Consider the vicinity of stationary inﬂection point (13). As long as ω

= ω0, the four

eigenvectors (58) of the transfer matrix TL comprise two extended and two evanescent Bloch

solutions. One of the extended modes (say, Φk1) corresponds to the non-degenerate real
root X1 = eik1L of the characteristic equation (60). This mode has negative axial group

velocity uz (k1) < 0 and, therefor, is of no interest for us. The other three eigenvectors

of TL correspond to three nearly degenerate roots (71). As ω approaches ω0, these three

eigenvalues become degenerate, while the respective three eigenvectors Φk2, Φk3, and Φk4

become collinear

and, therefore, cannot be diagonalized. It is shown rigorously in [16], that the very fact that

the TL eigenvalues display the singularity (71), implies that at ω = ω0, the matrix TL has

the canonical form (76). In line with (75), the matrix TL from Eq. (76) has only two (not

four!) eigenvectors:

tended mode with uz < 0;

1. Φk1 = Ψk1 (0), corresponding to the non-degenerate root X1 and relating to the ex-

2. Φk0 = Ψk0 (0), corresponding to the triple root X0 and related to the AFM.

The other two solutions of the Maxwell equation (38) at ω = ω0 are general Floquet

eigenmodes, which do not reduce to the canonical Bloch form (54). Yet, they can be related

to Ψk0 (z). Indeed, following the standard procedure (see, for example, [21, 22]), consider

an extended Bloch solution Ψk (z) of the reduced Maxwell equation (38)

LΨk (z) = 0, where L = ∂z −

where both operators M (z) and L (z) are functions of ω and (kx, ky). Assume now that the

axial dispersion relation ω (k) has a stationary inﬂection point (13) at k = k0. Diﬀerentiating

Eq. (77) with respect to k at constant (kx, ky) gives, with consideration for Eq. (13),

L∂kΨk (z) = 0, L∂2

kkΨk (z) = 0, at k = k0.

To summarize, at the frequency ω0 of AFM, there are four solutions for the reduced

Maxwell equation (38)

Ψk1 (z) , Ψk0 (z) , Ψ01 (z) , Ψ02 (z)

(82)

The ﬁrst two solutions from (82) are extended Bloch eigenmodes with uz < 0 and uz =

0, respectively. The other two solutions diverges as the ﬁrst and the second power of z,

respectively, they are referred to as general (non-Bloch) Floquet modes.

Deviation of the frequency ω from ω0 removes the triple degeneracy (76) of the matrix

TL, as seen from Eq. (71). The modiﬁed matrix TL can now be reduced to a diagonal form

with the set (58) of four eigenvectors comprising two extended and two evanescent Bloch

solutions.

E. Symmetry considerations

In Section 2, we discussed the relation between the symmetry of the axial dispersion

relation of a periodic stack, and the phenomenon of AFM. At this point we can prove that

indeed, the axial spectral asymmetry (17) is a necessary condition for the occurrence of

the stationary inﬂection point and for the AFM associated with such a point. As we have

seen earlier in this Section, the stationary inﬂection point relates to a triple root of the

characteristic polynomial F (X) from Eq. (60). Since F (X) is a polynomial of the fourth

degree, it cannot have a symmetric pair of triple roots, that would have been the case for

axially symmetric dispersion relation. Hence, only asymmetric axial dispersion relation ω (k)

can display a stationary inﬂection point (13) or, equivalently, (16), as shown in Fig. 4(b). In

this respect, the situation with the AFM is somewhat similar to that of the frozen mode in

unidirectional magnetic photonic crystals [16]. The diﬀerence lies in the physical nature of

the phenomenon. The bulk spectral asymmetry (24) leading to the eﬀect of electromagnetic

unidirectionality, essentially requires the presence of nonreciprocal magnetic materials. By

contrast, the axial spectral asymmetry (17) along with the AFM regime can be realized

in perfectly reciprocal periodic dielectric stacks with symmetric bulk dispersion relation

(22). On the other hand, the axial spectral asymmetry essentially requires an oblique light

incidence, which is not needed for the bulk spectral asymmetry.

Another important symmetry consideration is that in the vicinity of the stationary in-

ﬂection point (13), all four Bloch eigenmodes (58) must have the same symmetry, which

means that all of them must belong to the same one-dimensional irreducible representation

of the Bloch wave vector group. This condition is certainly met when the direction deﬁned

by (nx, ny) is not special in terms of symmetry. Let us see what happens if the above con-

dition is not in place. Consider the situation (31), when at any given frequency ω and ﬁxed

(nx, ny) = (nx, 0), two of the Bloch eigenmodes are TE modes and the other two are TM

modes. Note, that TE and TM modes belong to diﬀerent one-dimensional representations

of the Bloch wave vector group. In such a case, the transfer matrix TL can be reduced to

28

The respective characteristic polynomial F (X) degenerates into

F (X) = FT E(X)FT M (X)

(83)

where FT E(X) and FT M (X) are independent second degree polynomials describing the TE

and TM spectral branches, respectively. Obviously, in such a situation, the transfer matrix

cannot have the nontrivial canonical form Eq.

(76), and the respective axial dispersion

relation cannot develop a stationary inﬂection point (69), regardless of whether or not the

axial spectral asymmetry is in place.

IV. THE AFM REGIME IN A SEMI-INFINITE STACK

A. Boundary conditions

In vacuum (to the left of semi-inﬁnite slab in Fig. 1) the electromagnetic ﬁeld ΨV (z) is

a superposition of the incident and reﬂected waves

At the slab boundary we have

ΨV (z) = ΨI (z) + ΨR (z) ,

at z < 0

ΨV (0) = ΨI (0) + ΨR (0) = ΦI + ΦR.

The transmitted wave ΨT (z) inside the semi-inﬁnite slab is a superposition of two Bloch

eigenmodes

ΨT (z) = Ψ1 (z) + Ψ2 (z) ,

at z > 0.

(87)

(in the case of a ﬁnite slab, all four eigenmodes (58) would contribute to ΨT (z)). The

eigenmodes Ψ1 (z) and Ψ2 (z) can be both extended (with ux > 0), one extended and one

evanescent (with ux > 0 and

k > 0, respectively), or both evanescent (with

k > 0),

ℑ

depending on which of the three cases (62), (63), or (64) we are dealing with. In particular,

in the vicinity of the AFM (e.g., the vicinity of ω0 in Fig. 4(b)), we always have the situation

(63). Therefore, in the vicinity of AFM, ΨT (z) is a superposition of the extended eigenmode

Ψex (z) with the group velocity uz > 0, and the evanescent mode Ψev (z) with

k > 0

ℑ

ℑ

ΨT (z) = Ψex (z) + Ψev (z) ,

at z > 0.

(88)

The asymptotic expressions for the respective wave vectors kex and kev in the vicinity of

AFM are given in Eq. (74).

When the frequency ω exactly coincides with the frequency ω0 of the AFM, the repre-

sentation (88) for ΨT (z) is not valid. In such a case, according to Eq. (74), there is no

evanescent modes at all. It turns out that at ω = ω0, the electromagnetic ﬁeld inside the

slab is a superposition of the extended mode Ψk0 (z) and the (non-Bloch) Floquet eigenmode

Ψ01 (z) from Eq. (80)

ΨT (z) = Ψk0 (z) + Ψ01 (z) , at ω = ω0 and z > 0.

(89)

Since the extended eigenmode Ψk0 (z) has zero axial group velocity uz, it does not contribute

to the axial energy ﬂux Sz. By contrast, the divergent non-Bloch contribution Ψ01 (z) is

associated with the ﬁnite axial energy ﬂux Sz > 0, although the notion of group velocity

does not apply here. The detailed analysis is carried out in the next subsection.

Knowing the eigenmodes inside the slab and using the standard electromagnetic boundary

conditions

ΦT = ΦI + ΦR, where Φ = Ψ (0) ,

(90)

30

one can express the amplitude and composition of the transmitted wave ΨT and reﬂected

wave ΨR, in terms of the amplitude and polarization of the incident wave ΨI. This gives

us the transmittance and reﬂectance coeﬃcients (2) of the semi-inﬁnite slab, as well as the

electromagnetic ﬁeld distribution ΨT (z) inside the slab, as functions of the incident wave

polarization, the direction ~n of incidence, and the frequency ω.

B. Field amplitude inside semi-inﬁnite slab

In what follows we assume that ω can be arbitrarily close but not equal to ω0, unless

otherwise is explicitly stated. This will allow us to treat the transmitted wave ΨT (z) as a

superposition (88) of one extended and one evanescent mode. Since evanescent modes do

not transfer energy in the z direction, the extended mode is solely responsible for the axial

energy ﬂux Sz

According to Eq. (109), Sz does not depend on z and can be expressed in terms of the

semi-inﬁnite slab transmittance τ from Eq. (2)

Sz (ΨT ) = Sz (Ψex) .

Let us see what happens when the frequency ω tends to its critical value ω0. According

to Eqs. (57) and (88), at z = NL, N = 0, 1, 2, ..., the resulting ﬁeld ΨT (z) inside the slab

can be represented as

ΨT (z) = Φexeizkex + Φeveizkev,

equation (38) at ω = ω0.

2. The role of the incident wave polarization

The incident wave polarization aﬀects the relative contributions of the extended and

evanescent components to the resulting ﬁeld ΨT (z) in Eq. (88). In addition, it also aﬀects

the overall transmittance (2). The situation here is similar to that of the normal incidence,

considered in [16]. There are two special cases, merging into a single one as ω

ω0.

→

The ﬁrst one occurs when the elliptic polarization of the incident wave is chosen so that it

produces a single extended eigenmode Ψex (z) inside the slab (no evanescent contribution to

ΨT (z)). In this case, ΨT (z) reduces to Ψex (z), and its amplitude

remains limited

ΨT (z)
|

|

and independent of z. As ω approaches ω0, the respective transmittance τ vanishes in this

case, and there is no AFM regime. The second special case is when the elliptic polarization of

the incident wave is chosen so that it produces a single evanescent eigenmode Ψev (z) inside

the slab (no extended contribution to ΨT (z)). In such a case, ΨT (z) reduces to Ψev (z),

and the amplitude

ΨT (z)

decays exponentially with z in accordance with Eq. (99). The

|

|

respective transmittance τ in this latter case is zero regardless of the frequency ω, because

evanescent modes do not transfer energy. Importantly, as ω approaches ω0, the polarizations

of the incident wave that produce either a sole extended or a sole evanescent mode become

indistinguishable, in accordance with Eq.

(75).

In the vicinity of the AFM regime, the

maximal transmittance τ is achieved for the incident wave polarization orthogonal to that

exciting a single extended or evanescent eigenmode inside the semi-inﬁnite stack.

33

C. Tangential energy ﬂux

So far we have been focusing on the axial electromagnetic ﬁeld distribution, as well as

the axial energy ﬂux Sz inside semi-inﬁnite slab. At the same time, in and near the AFM

regime, the overwhelmingly stronger energy ﬂux occurs in the tangential direction. Let us

take a closer look at this problem.

The axial energy ﬂux Sz is exclusively provided by the extended contribution Ψex (z) to

the resulting ﬁeld ΨT (z), because the evanescent mode Ψev (z) does not contribute to Sz.

nor Sz depends on z (see Eq. (109)). By contrast, both the extended and
Neither
the evanescent modes determine the tangential energy ﬂux ~Sτ (z). Besides, according to Eq.

Ψex|

|

(109), the tangential energy ﬂux depends on z. Far from the AFM regime, the role of the

evanescent mode is insigniﬁcant, because Ψev (z) is appreciable only in a narrow region close

to the slab boundary. But the situation appears quite diﬀerent near the AFM frequency.

Indeed, according to Eq. (99), the imaginary part of the respective Bloch wave vector kev

becomes inﬁnitesimally small near the critical point. As a consequence, the evanescent mode
extends deep inside the slab, so does its role in formation of ~Sτ (z). The tangential energy
ﬂux ~Sτ (z) as function of z can be directly obtained using formula (111) and the explicit
expression for ΨT (z) = Ψex (z) + Ψev (z). Although the explicit expression for ~Sτ (z) is

rather complicated and cumbersome, it has very simple and transparent structure. Indeed,

the tangential energy ﬂux can be represented in the following form

~Sτ (z) = ~uτ W (z) ,

where the tangential group velocity ~uτ behaves regularly at ω = ω0. Therefore, the magni-
tude and the space distribution of the tangential energy ﬂux ~Sτ (z) in and near the AFM

regime literally coincides with that of the electromagnetic energy density W (z), which is

proportional to

ΨT (z)

|

|

2. A typical picture of that is shown in Fig. 5(a).

V. SUMMARY

As we have seen in the previous Section, a distinctive characteristic of the AFM regime

is that the incident monochromatic radiation turns into a very unusual grazing wave inside

the slab, as shown schematically in Figs. 3 and 6. Such a grazing wave is signiﬁcantly

diﬀerent from that occurring in the vicinity of the total internal reﬂection regime, where the

34

transmitted wave also propagates along the interface. The most obvious diﬀerence is that

near the regime of total internal reﬂection, the reﬂectivity approaches unity, which implies

that the intensity of the transmitted (refracted) wave vanishes. By contrast, in the case of

AFM the light reﬂection from the interface can be small, as shown in an example in Fig.

4(a). Thus, in the AFM case, a signiﬁcant portion of the incident light gets converted into

the grazing wave (the AFM) with huge amplitude, compared to that of the incident wave.

For this reason, the AFM regime can be of great utility in many applications.

Another distinctive feature of the AFM regime relates to the ﬁeld distribution inside

the periodic medium. The electromagnetic ﬁeld of the AFM can be approximated by a
2 increases as z2,

divergent Floquet eigenmode Ψ10 (z) from (80), whose magnitude

Ψ10 (z)
|

|

until nonlinear eﬀects or other limiting factors come into play. In fact, the ﬁeld amplitude

inside the slab can exceed the amplitude of the incident plane wave by several orders of

magnitude, depending on the quality of the periodic array, the actual number of the layers,

and the width of the incident light beam.

Looking at the z component of light group velocity and energy ﬂux, we see a dramatic

slowdown of light in the vicinity of the AFM regime, with all possible practical applications

extensively discussed in the literature (see, for example, [9, 10, 11, 12], and references

therein). In principle, there can be a situation when the tangential components (ux, uy) of the

group velocity also vanish in the AFM regime, along with the axial component uz. Although

we did not try to achieve such a situation in our numerical experiments, it is not prohibited

and might occur if the physical parameters of the periodic array are chosen properly. In

such a case, the AFM regime reduces to its particular case – the frozen mode regime with

~u = 0 inside the periodic medium. This regime would be similar to that considered in [16],

with one important diﬀerence: it is not related to the magnetic unidirectionality and, hence,

there is no need to incorporate nonreciprocal magnetic layers in the periodic array. The

latter circumstance allows to realize the frozen mode regime at the infrared, optical, and

even UV frequency range.

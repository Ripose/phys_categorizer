Airborne contaminants, e.g., bacterial spores, are usually analyzed by time consuming mi-

croscopic, chemical and biological assays. Current research into real time laser spectroscopic

detectors of such contaminants is based on e.g. resonant Raman spectroscopy. The present

approach derives from recent experiments in which atoms and molecules are prepared by one

(or more) coherent laser(s) and probed by another set of lasers. These studies have yielded

such counterintuitive results as lasers which operate without inversion, ultra-slow light with

group velocities of order 10 meters/sec, and generation of ultra-short pulses of light via

phased molecular states. The preceding examples are based on inducing a phase coherent

state of matter in the ensemble of simple molecules being studied. The connection with pre-

vious studies based on “Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy” (CARS) is to be noted.

However generating and utilizing maximally coherent oscillation in macromolecules having

an enormous number of degrees of freedom is much more challenging.

In particular, the

short dephasing times and rapid decoherence rates are major obstacles. However, adiabatic

fast passage techniques and the ability to generate combs of phase coherent femtosecond

pulses, provide new tools for the generation and utilization of maximal quantum coherence

INTRODUCTION

3

There is an urgent need for the rapid assay of chemical and biological unknowns, such

as bioaerosols. Substantial progress toward this goal has been made over the past decade.

Techniques such as ﬂuorescence spectroscopy [1, 2], and UV resonant Raman spectroscopy

[3, 4, 5, 6] have been successfully applied to the identiﬁcation of biopolymers, bacteria, and

bioaerosols.

At present ﬁeld devices are being engineered [1] which will involve an optical preselection

stage based on, e.g., ﬂuorescence radiation as in Fig. 1. If the ﬂuorescence measurement

does not give the signature of the particle of interest then that particle is ignored. Most

of the time the particle will be an uninteresting dust particle; however, when a signature

match is recorded, then the particle is selected for special biological assay, see Fig. 1b. Such

a two stage approach can substantially speed up the detection procedure. The relatively

simple ﬂuorescence stage can very quickly sort out some of the uninteresting particles while

the more time consuming bio-tests will only be used for the “suspects”.

The good news about the resonance ﬂuorescence technique is that it is fast and simple.

The bad news is that while it can tell the diﬀerence between dust and bacterial spores, it

can not diﬀerentiate between spores and many other organic bioaerosols, see Fig. 1c.

However, in spite of the encouraging success of the above mentioned studies, there is

still interest in other approaches to, and tools for, the rapid identiﬁcation of chemical and

biological substances. To quote from a recent study [7]:

“Current [ﬂuorescence based] prototypes are a large improvement over earlier

stand-oﬀ systems, but they cannot yet consistently identify speciﬁc organisms

because of the similarity of their emission spectra. Advanced signal processing

techniques may improve identiﬁcation.”

Resonant Raman spectra hold promise for being spore speciﬁc as indicated in Fig. 2b.

This is the good news, the bad news is that the Raman signal is weak and it takes several

minutes to collect the data of Fig. 2b. Since the through-put of aerosol particles in a set-up

such as that of Fig. 1b is large, the optical interrogation per particle must be essentially

instantaneous.

The question then is: Can we increase the resonant Raman signal strength and thereby

reduce the interrogation time per particle? If so, then the technique may also be useful in

4

various detection scenarios.

The answer to the question of the proceeding paragraph is a qualiﬁed “yes.” We can

enhance the Raman signal by increasing the coherent molecular oscillation amplitude R0

indicated in 2c. In essence this means maximizing the quantum coherence between states

and

“phaseonium” [8].

Our point of view derives from research in the ﬁelds of laser physics and quantum optics

which have concentrated on the utilization and maximization of quantum coherence. The

basis for these studies is the observation that an ensemble of atoms or molecules in a co-

herent superposition of states represents, in a real sense, a new state of matter aptly called

In particular, we note that matter in thermodynamic equilibrium has no phase coherence

between the electrons in the molecules making up the ensemble. This is discussed in detail

spectroscopy; (b) Figure depicting a scenario in which a UV laser interacts with dust

the particles are deﬂected in another direction and these particles are then subjected to

further biological tests; (c) The shaded area displays the signal range for the ﬂuorescence

in Section III. When a coherent superposition of quantum states is involved, things are very

diﬀerent and based on these observations, many interesting and counterintuitive notions

are now a laboratory reality. These include lasing without inversion (LWI) [9], electromag-

netically induced transparency (EIT) [10], light having ultra slow group velocities on the

order of 10 meters/sec [11], and the generation of ultra short pulses of light based on phased

6

molecular states [12].

Another emerging technology central to the present paper is the exciting progress in the

area of femtosecond quantum control of molecular dynamics, as described and reviewed

in the articles by Kosloﬀ et al.

[13], Warren, Rabitz and Dahleh [14], Gordon and Rice

[15], Zare [16], Rabitz, de-Vivie-Riedle, Motzkus and Kompa [17], and Brixner, Damrauer

and Gerber [18]. Other related work on quantum coherent control includes: (1) The quan-

tum interference approach of Brumer and Shapiro [19]; (2) the time-domain (pump-dump)

technique proposed by Tannor, Kosloﬀ and Rice [20]; (3) the stimulated Raman Adiabatic

Passage (STIRAP) approach of Bergmann and co-workers [21] to generate a train of coher-

ent laser pulses. This allows us to produce pulses having arbitrary controllable amplitude

and frequency time dependence. Indeed the ability to sculpt pulses by the femtosecond pulse

shaper provides an important new tool for all of optics, see the pioneering works by Heritage,

Weiner, and Thurston [22], Weiner, Heritage, and Kirschner [23], Wefers and Nelson [24]

and Weiner [25].

An important aspect of the learning algorithms approach is that knowledge of the molec-

ular potential energy surfaces and matrix elements between surfaces are not needed. Precise

taxonomic marker frequencies may not be known a priori; however, by using a pulse shaper

coupled with a feedback system, complex spectra can be revealed.

Thus, we now have techniques at hand for controlling trains of phase coherent femtosecond

pulses so as to maximize molecular coherence. This allows us to increase the Raman signal

while decreasing the undesirable ﬂuorescence background. This has much in common with

the CARS spectroscopy [26] of Fig. 3, but with essential diﬀerences.

The basic improvement over ordinary CARS is based on enhancing the ground state

molecular coherence. However, we note that molecules involving a large number of degrees

of freedom will quickly dissipate the molecular coherence amongst these degrees of freedom.

This is a well known diﬃculty and is addressed in the present work from several perspec-

tives. First of all, when working with ultra short pulses, we have the ability to generate

the coherence on a time scale which is small compared with the molecular relaxation time.

Furthermore, we are able to tailor the pulse sequence in such a way as to mitigate, and

overcome key limitations in the application of conventional CARS to trace contaminants.

The key point is that we are trying to induce maximal coherence, as opposed to the usual

situation within conventional CARS where the ground state coherence is not a maximum as

7

is shown later in this paper. With FAST CARS (Femtosecond Adaptive Spectroscopic Tech-

niques applied to Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy) we can prepare the coherence

between two vibrational states of a molecule with one set of laser pulses; and use higher

frequency visible or ultra-violet to probe this coherence in a coherent Raman conﬁguration.

This will allow us to capitalize on the fact that maximally coherent Raman spectroscopy is

orders of magnitude more sensitive than incoherent Raman spectroscopy.

To summarize: the present work focuses on utilization of a maximally phase coherent

ensemble of molecules, i.e. molecular phaseonium, to enhance Raman signatures. This will

be accomplished via the careful tailoring of a coherent pulse designed to set the molecule

in maximum oscillation. Such a pulse is a sort of “melody” designed to excite a particular

molecule. Once we know this molecular melody, we can use it to set that particular molecule

in motion and this oscillatory motion is then detected by another pulse; this is the FAST

CARS protocol depicted in Figs 3c and 15b.

In order to establish the viability and credibility of this program, the material covered

in the present paper is presented in some detail. It is hoped that scientists who are experts

in one phase of the subject, e.g., molecular biology but not with subtleties of modern laser

spectroscopy can read the paper without undue appeal to the literature or detailed mathe-

matical developments. On the other hand, the fact that UV Raman spectroscopy has been

successfully applied to such complicated systems as living bacteria comes as a surprise to

many laser spectroscopists. Hence, a short overview of some aspects of Raman spectroscopy

as applied to macromolecules and especially to biological spores is presented.

In Section II, the status of Raman spectroscopy applied to biological spores is reviewed. In

Section III, we compare various types of Raman spectroscopy with an eye to the recent suc-

cessful applications of quantum coherence in laser physics and quantum optics. Section IV

presents several experimental schemes for applying these considerations to the rapid identiﬁ-

cation of macromolecules, in general, and biological spores, in particular. Finally in Section

V we propose several scenarios in which FAST CARS could be useful in the rapid detection

of bacterial spores. Where appropriate, mathematical details are included in Appendices

and comparison between the various types of Raman spectroscopic techniques are discussed

with special emphasis on overall sensitivity. Thus much of the present paper is meant to

be a review.† However the diﬀerent possible Raman schemes applied to macromolecular

ﬁngerprinting, e.g., developing the proper molecular melody for various endospores takes

us dangerously close to speculative thin ice. We do recognize that both the biologists and

spectroscopists will probably be annoyed by some parts of the present paper; but, we hope,

perhaps provoked as well. If the reader is not provoked we apologize, it is very diﬃcult to

annoy everybody in a single paper.

† Nevermind that we had to work a good bit to quantify the diﬀerence between the various possible kinds

of Raman Spectroscopy as presented in Table I.

II. PICO-REVIEW OF RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY APPLIED TO BACTERIAL

SPORES

The bacterial spore is an amazing life form. Spores thousands of years old have been

found to be viable. One textbook [27] reports that “endospores trapped in amber for 25

million years germinate when placed in nutrient media.”

A key to this incredible longevity is the presence of dipicolinic acid (DPA) and its salt

calcium dipicolinate in the living core which contains the DNA, RNA, and protein as shown

in Fig. 4.

FIG. 4: Sketch of spore indicating that the DPA and its salts, e.g., Ca-DPA are contained

in the core and are in contact with the spore speciﬁc DNA ribosomes and cell proteins.

A major role of the calcium DPA complex seems to be the removal of water, as per the

following quote [28] : “The exact role of these [DNA] chemicals is not yet clear. We know,

for instance, that heat destroys cells by inactivating proteins and DNA and that this process

requires a certain amount of water. Since the deposition of calcium dipicolinate in the spore

removes water . . . it will be less vulnerable to heat.”

Hence, one of the major components of bacterial spores is dipicolinic acid (DPA) and its

ion as depicted in Fig. 5. Calcium dipicolinate can contribute up to 17% of the dry weight of

the spores. A deﬁnitive demonstration [3] of this conjecture was made by comparing the 242

nm excitation spectra of calcium dipicolinate with spore suspensions of Bacillus megaterium

and Bacillus cereus. From Fig. 2b, it is seen that exact matches were noted for the 1017,

1195, 1396, 1446, and 1579 cm−

1 peaks of the calcium dipicolinate.

As has been emphasized by W. Nelson and coworkers [3, 4, 5, 6], the presence of DPA

and its calcium salt gives us a ready made marker for endospores. As has been mentioned

A possible FAST CARS protocol is as follows: First we obtain size and ﬂuorescence

information. If this is consistent with the presence of a particular bacterial spore we could

then automatically perform a FAST CARS analysis sensitive to DPA so as to further narrow

the number of suspects.

It is important to note that just as resonant Raman is some 106 times more sensitive

11

than non-resonant; coherent Raman yields a much stronger signal than ordinary incoherent

Raman spectroscopy. This makes it possible to collect the Raman spectra much more rapidly

via FAST CARS and this is very important in the present scheme.

To summarize: we will generate quantum coherence in macromolecules by working with

the now available femtosecond pulse trains in which there exists phase coherence between

the individual pulses. In this way, one can enhance coherent Raman signatures. The uti-

lization of “molecular music” to generate maximal phase coherence holds promise for the

identiﬁcation and characterization of macro and bio-molecules.

III. COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY

Raman scattering is an inelastic scattering of electromagnetic ﬁelds oﬀ vibrating

molecules. The origin of Raman scattering dates back to a theoretical paper in Naturwis-

senschaften by A. Smekal in 1923 entitled (translated) “The quantum theory of dispersion”

[29]. It was followed by another paper in a 1923 Physical Review (by A. Compton) entitled

“A quantum theory of the scattering of X-rays by light elements” [30]. Some historians feel

that these two papers gave C.V. Raman the idea for the experiments that were performed

with K.S. Krishnan and led to the discovery of the eﬀect in over 60 liquids. Raman and

Krishnan published their results entitled “A new type of secondary radiation” in Nature

on March 28, 1928 [31]. It was soon followed by the landmark paper of G. Landsberg and

L. Mandelstam who found the same eﬀect in quartz and published a paper entitled (trans-

lated) “A novel eﬀect of light scattering in crystals” which appeared on July 13, 1928 in

Naturwissenschaften [32]. By the end of 1928 dozens of papers had already been published

on the “Raman” eﬀect.

In this section we ﬁrst recall the quantum mechanical picture of a vibrating molecule and

then discuss the principles of diﬀerent types of Raman spectroscopy.

A. Molecular vibrations

Let us consider a simple diatomic molecule for explanation of the principle. The in-

teratomic oscillation can be visualized via a classical picture of the vibrating molecule as

in Fig. 2c. Quantum mechanically, the situation can be understand as depicted in Fig.

7. The potential energy of the molecule depends on the interatomic distance z and has a

well pronounced minimum. The Hamiltonian of the vibrating molecule has a set of dis-

crete eigenstates; in Fig. 7 we show just the ground state

b

Whereas in each of these states the mean displacement from the equilibrium position is zero,

and the ﬁrst excited state

a quantum superposition of these states has generally a nonzero mean displacement R(t)

which varies with time. Assuming that in time t = 0 the molecule is in a superposition state

the maximum magnitude (i.e., for

We emphasize that when all molecules are in the same superposition state, the response

of the sample to an optical signal is very diﬀerent from the thermal state. Preparation and

optical probing of molecular vibrations is the essence of Raman spectroscopy.

B. Classical description of the Raman scattering

The simplest classical description of the Raman eﬀect assumes that the polarizability α

of the molecule is dependent on the positions of the atomic nuclei. The polarizability is

the proportionality factor between the external electric ﬁeld E and the molecular dipole

moment P , P = αE, and for a vibrating molecule it is a time-dependent quantity. In the

linear approximation, and assuming just the scalar case, the polarizability can be written as

α(Q) = α(0) + α′Q, where Q is the generalized coordinate of the vibrating molecule, α(0)

is the polarizability of the equilibrium state, and α′ = ∂α/∂Q with Q = 0. If the molecule

vibrates with frequency ωbc, the coordinate Q changes as Q = Q0 cos(ωabt). The electric ﬁeld

Even though this model is able to predict the correct frequencies of the scattered light,

it cannot tell us anything about the intensities of diﬀerent ﬁeld components in spontaneous

scattering processes. To get more information about the scattering process, one needs a

quantum mechanical model of the molecule. Let us now study the main features of the

various Raman scattering processes.

C. Stokes vs. anti-Stokes scattering

Raman scattering is an optical phenomenon in which there is a change of frequency of

the incident light. Light with frequency ν1 scatters inelastically oﬀ the vibrating molecules
such that the scattered ﬁeld has frequency ν2 = ν1 ±
molecular vibrations. The ﬁeld with down-shifted frequency ν2 = ν1 −

ωbc, where ωbc is the frequency of the

ωbc is called Stokes

ﬁeld and its generation corresponds to the process depicted in Fig. 8a, whereas the frequency

up-shifted radiation is called the anti-Stokes ﬁeld and corresponds to the process in Fig. 8b.

D. Spontaneous vs. stimulated Raman scattering

There are two basic Raman processes: the so-called spontaneous and stimulated Raman

scattering. Spontaneous scattering occurs if a single laser beam with intensity below a

certain threshold illuminates the sample. In condensed matter, in propagating through 1

cm of the scattering medium, only approximately 10−

6 of the incident radiation is typically

scattered into the Stokes ﬁeld (see, e.g., [33]). Stimulated scattering which occurs with a

very intense illuminating beam is a much stronger process in which several percent of the

incident laser beam can be converted into the other frequencies. From the quantum-optical

point of view, the Raman scattering can be described by means of photon numbers occupied

in diﬀerent modes. The rate of photon number increase in the Stokes mode can be written

as ˙nS = ηnL(nS + 1), where nL is the number of photons in the incident laser mode and nS

is the number of photons in the Stokes mode. Here η is a proportionality constant.

For spontaneous Stokes scattering nS ≪

1, and the intensity of the scattered ﬁeld is

roughly proportional to the length traveled by the incident ﬁeld in the medium. On the

other hand, for nS > 1, the stimulated process becomes dominant and the scattered ﬁeld

intensity can increase exponentially with the medium length.

E. Resonant vs. non-resonant Raman processes

The resonant Raman process (appearing when the frequency of the incident radiation

coincides with one of the electronic transitions) is much richer than the nonresonant, and

we now turn to a discussion of the resonant problem.

where the Raman coherence is ρbc as discussed earlier, e.g. Fig. 7.

In Eq.

(3), ωab is

the transition frequency between the electronic states a and b, ν2 is the frequency of the

generated ﬁeld, and the other quantities are deﬁned in the caption of Table I.

The main advantage of resonant Raman scattering is that the signal is very strong—up

to a million times stronger compared to the signal of nonresonant scattering [4]. It is also

very useful that only those Raman lines corresponding to very few vibrational modes associ-

ated with strongly absorbing locations of a molecule show this huge intensity enhancement.

On the other hand, the resonance Raman spectra may be contaminated with ﬂuorescence.

However, this problem can be avoided by using UV light so that most of the ﬂuorescence

appears at much longer wavelengths than the Raman scattered light and is easily ﬁltered

out.

F. Coherent vs. incoherent Raman scattering from many molecules

An important distinction between diﬀerent Raman scattering schemes is based on the

phase relation of the ﬁeld scattered oﬀ diﬀerent molecules. In the incoherent case the spon-

taneous contributions of individual molecules sum up with random phases. The magnitude

of the emitted electric ﬁeld then scales as √N (see Fig. 9a). On the other hand, if all

the molecules are prepared in the same coherent superposition of their states

i
their contributions to the emitted ﬁeld have the same phases and the magnitude of their

sum is proportional to N (see Fig. 9b). Thus, the intensity radiated from the sample is

proportional to N in the incoherent case and to N 2 in the coherent case.

There is another important aspect of the coherent vs.

incoherent resonant scattering

process, namely the rate of emission from the N atom ensemble. In the far oﬀ resonance,

Smekel-Raman limit, the emission and absorption are simultaneous since the transitions to

the excited state(s) are virtual. This is not true for the resonant Raman processes. In that

case the molecule is excited to the

state of Fig. 10 where, in the case of weak Stokes

a
i

|

ﬁeld εc, it can live for many nanoseconds.

However, the cooperative emission rate from N molecules can be much faster than that

of a single molecule. As was shown by Dicke, and derived in Appendix B, if the spontaneous

emission lifetime of N incoherent dipoles is given by τ ; then the cooperative spontaneous

emission lifetime of N coherently prepared dipoles can be as short as τ /N.

This superradiant “speed up” of the radiation process can have important consequences

for the present problem. We recall that the experiments of Nelson and coworkers [3, 4, 5, 6]

are carried out at 242 nm so as to “ride above” the ﬂuorescence noise, see Fig. 10b. But,

if we can enhance the spontaneous emission rate so that the transition rate from the a2

manifold to the ground state g is faster than from the internal (non radiative) rate from
a2 →
carry out resonant Raman studies with visible or near UV lasers instead of using the 242

IV. FAST CARS

A. Generation of atomic coherence

19

The purpose of this section is to demonstrate the utility of pulse shaping as a mechanism

for generating maximal coherence. The Raman signal is optimized at the condition of

maximal molecular coherence. When in this state, each of the molecules oscillates at a

maximal amplitude, and all molecules in an ensemble oscillate in unison. Here we discuss

several methods for the preparation of maximal coherence state.

1. Adiabatic Rapid Passage via Chirped Pulses

A particularly simple and robust approach to the generation of the maximal coherence

is to use a detuning δω which is large enough such that only small virtual excitation of the

upper state is possible (Fig. 11).

Such multilevel molecular system can be described in terms of an eﬀective two-by-two

Hamiltonian [35]. Diagonalization of this Hamiltonian (Appendix C) allows us to analyze

the ﬁelds changing slowly as compared to the separation of the eigenvalues. Instead, at a

ﬁxed ﬁeld, one may allow ∆ω to chirp from an initial value toward zero.

mechanisms in two-state and multi-state systems, and Kaplan et al.

[38] have predicted

21

existence of 2π Raman solitons.

2. Fractional STIRAP

In an all-resonant Λ scheme (Fig. 12, with δω = ∆ω = 0) maximal coherence can be

prepared between the levels b and c in a fractional stimulated Raman adiabatic passage

(STIRAP) set up by a counterintuitive pulse sequence [21, 39, 40], such that the population

of the upper state a is always zero and ﬂuorescence from this state is eliminated. This can

be accomplished via a counterintuitive sequence of two pulses at frequencies ωab and ωac.

Under the condition of adiabatic passage, the molecule in the initial state

The principle behind a STIRAP process is the adiabatic theorem as applied to the time-

varying Hamiltonian H(t). If the system at time t0 is in an eigenstate of H(t0), and the

evolution from t0 to t1 is suﬃciently slow, then the system will evolve into the eigenstate of

H(t1). The three-level atomic system driven by two ﬁelds has three eigenstates, one of which

is a linear superposition of only the lower levels b and c. The time dependent amplitudes of

this eigenstate depend on the pulse shapes of the ﬁelds at frequencies ωab and ωac. Thus,

by an appropriate pulse shaping, it should be possible to prepare a maximally coherent

superposition of states b and c as shown in Fig. 12. The expressions for the Hamiltonian

and the corresponding eigenstates are given in Appendix D.

As the system is almost never in the excited state

, the spontaneous emission from level

22

a does not aﬀect the preparation of the coherent atomic state and the ﬂuorescent background

is eliminated.

Comparing diﬀerent schemes for the preparation of maximal coherence, we note that

the required laser power is much lower for the all-resonant scheme, but in the case of

biomolecules, UV lasers are required. The far-detuned scheme will work with more powerful

infrared lasers, up to the point of laser damage. As for the comparison of adiabatic and

non-adiabatic regimes, we should note that the adiabatic scheme may turn out to be more

robust, because it does not rely on a particular pulse area and works for inhomogeneous

molecular ensembles and non-uniform laser beams.

3. Femtosecond Pulse Sequences

In a series of beautiful experiments K. Nelson and coworkers [41] have generated coherent

molecular vibration, see Fig. 13. They nicely describe their work as: “Timed sequences of

femtosecond pulses have been used to repetitively “push” molecules in an organic crystal

. . . , in a manner closely analogous to the way a child on a swing may be pushed repetitively

to reach oscillatory motion.”

An interesting aspect of this approach is the fact that the individual pulses need not be

strong. Only the collective eﬀect of many weak pulses is required. This may be helpful if
E2, is a problem. This will be further discussed

molecular “break-up”, due to strong

E1 and

elsewhere.

B. Adaptive Evolutionary Algorithms

23

So far we described how one-photon and two-photon resonant pulse sequences can be

used to produce a coherent molecular superposition state. The idea is that once this state

is created, a delayed pulse can be applied in order to produce Raman scattering which will

bear the signature of the molecular system. The Raman signal is expected to be optimized

when the molecular coherence is maximal.

In general, however, things are complicated by the Franck-Condon factors. As an example

of a more complicated situation consider Fig. 14. There we see a multilevel system with the

ground state

and the ﬁrst excited vibrational state of the electronic potential.

The preceding example shows that even in a simpliﬁed ideal few-level system, preparation

of maximal molecular coherence may require application of a complicated pulse sequence.

For large bio-molecules the level structure is not only much more complex, but usually

unknown. We now consider how search algorithms can be used to ﬁnd the optimal pulse

sequence for a complicated molecule with an unknown Hamiltonian. This approach will

eventually lead to an eﬃcient generation of “molecular ﬁngerprints”.

In order to achieve this goal we will need to (1) utilize a technique for preparation of

complex shaped pulse sequences; (2) ﬁnd the particular pulse sequences, required for the

excitation of the particular bio-molecules and for the production of spectral signatures,

which will allow one to distinguish (with certainty) the target biological agent from any

other species.

Pulse shaping techniques already exist; they are based on “spectral modiﬁcation”. First,

a large coherent bandwidth is produced by an ultra-short pulse generation technique [42].

Then, the spectrum is dispersed with a grating or a prism, and each frequency component is

addressed individually by a spatial light modulator (a liquid crystal array [43] or an acous-

tic modulator [44]). This way, individual spectral amplitudes and phases can be adjusted

independently. Finally, the spectrum is recombined into a single beam by a second disper-

sive element, and focused onto the target. This technique allows synthesis of arbitrarily

shaped pulses right at the target point, and avoids problems associated with dispersion of

intermediate optical elements and windows.

A particular shaped pulse sequence can be represented by a three-dimensional surface

in a space with frequency-amplitude-phase axes. Each pulse shape, which corresponds to a

particular 3-D surface, produces a molecular response. The problem is to ﬁnd the optimal

shape. The search space is too large to be scanned completely. Besides, many local optima

may exist in the problem. The solution is oﬀered by “global search” algorithms (such

as adaptive evolutionary algorithms) [45, 46]. In this approach the experimental output is

25

included in the optimization process. This way, the molecules subjected to control, are called

upon to guide the search for an optimal pulse sequence within a learning loop [47]. With the

proper algorithm, automated cycling of this loop provides a means of ﬁnding optimal pulse

shapes under constraints of the molecular Hamiltonian and the experimental conditions. No

prior knowledge of the molecular Hamiltonian and the potential energy surfaces is needed

in this case.

This adaptive technique was developed for coherent control of chemical reactions [46].

The idea is that the pulses can be optimized to produce desired chemical products. In our

problem we want to optimize Raman generation. In this case both preparation and reading

pulses can be adaptively shaped in order to maximize the signal. Fig. 15 shows schematics

for the experimental setup that implements these ideas.

Generated spectra will be diﬀerent for diﬀerent molecular species. And our task is not

only to maximize Raman generation, but also to identify spectral patterns characteristic of

particular species and maximize the diﬀerence in the spectrum produced by the target bio-

molecule from spectra produced by any other bio-molecules. The key idea here is to apply

the same adaptive algorithms in order to learn these optimal “molecular ﬁngerprints”.

We note that the complexity of the molecular level structure is not so much a problem as

a solution to a problem. We can take advantage of the richness of the molecular structure,

and the inﬁnite variety of possible pulse shapes, in order to distinguish diﬀerent species with

the required certainty.

V. POSSIBLE FAST CARS MEASUREMENT STRATEGIES FOR DETECTION

OF BACTERIAL SPORES

Having presented the FAST CARS technique in some detail we now return to the question

of its application to “ﬁngerprinting” of macromolecules and bacterial spores. Some aspects of

the technique seem fairly simple to implement and would seem to hold relatively immediate

promise. Others are more challenging but will probably be useful at least in some cases.

Still other applications, e.g., the stand-oﬀ detection of bioaerosols in the atmosphere present

many open questions and require careful study.

In the following we discuss some simple

FAST CARS experiments which are underway and/or being assembled in our laboratories.

particles is like “singing a song” and listening for the standing ovation after an intricate

aria.

A. Preselection and hand-oﬀ scenarios

At present, ﬁeld devices are being engineered which will involve an optical preselection

stage based on, e.g., ﬂuorescence tagging. If the ﬂuorescence measurement does not match

the class of particles of interest then that particle is ignored. When many such particles

are tested and a possible positive is recorded, the particle is subjected to special biological

assay; see Fig. 16a. Such a two stage approach can substantially speed up the detection

procedure. The relatively simple ﬂuorescence stage can very quickly sort out many uninter-

esting scattering centers while the more sophisticated Raman scattering protocol will only

be used for the captured “suspects”.

The properly shaped preparation pulse sequence will be determined by, e.g., the adaptive

learning algorithm approach as per section IV B. The amplitude and phase content of

the pulse which produces maximum oscillation may be linked to a musical tune. Each

spore will have a song which results in maximum Raman coherence. A correctly chosen

“melody” induces a characteristic response of the molecular vibrations—a response which

is as unique as possible for the bacterial spores to be detected. Playing a melody rather

than a single tone is a generalization that enables us to see a multidimensional picture of

the investigated object. We note that the optimization can (and frequently will) include not

only the preparation pulses 1 and 2 (see Fig. 15b), but also the probe pulse 3, in particular,

its central frequency and timing. Analysis of the response to such a complex input is a

complicated signal processing problem. Various data mining strategies may be utilized in a

way similar to speech analysis.

However, taking into account the fact that we work with femtosecond pulses chained in

picosecond to nanosecond pulse trains, the whole analysis can be very short. In particular,

if we recall the long sampling time of the complete ﬂuorescence spectra of [5] being

15min,

≈

our estimation of a microsecond analysis is a very strong argument for the chosen approach.

B. Possible further Raman characterization

After a suspect particle has been targeted, it may be subject to a whole variety of inves-

tigative strategies. Raman scattering oﬀ a ﬂying particle can be very fast, but not necessarily

the most accurate method. It will be very useful to pin the particle on a ﬁxed surface and

cool it down to maximize the decoherence time T2 so that the characteristic lines are nar-

rowed down. The particle can be deﬂected by optical means (laser tweezers, laser ionization,

etc.) and attached to a cooled conducting surface (see Fig. 17). Cooling to liquid helium
temperature would enable us to enhance the dephasing time from T2 ∼

C. Possible FAST CARS stand-oﬀ detection and rapid identiﬁcation of bacterial

spores

We consider some speculative observations for long range (stand-oﬀ) measurements.

The chemical state of DPA in the spore is of special interest to us because the stuﬀ we

hang on the DPA molecule will determine its characteristic Raman frequency. To this end,

we quote from article [48] by Murrell on the chemical composition of spores: “When DPA

is isolated from spores it is nearly always in the Ca-CDPA chelate but sometimes as the

chelate of other divalent metals [e.g. Zn, Mn, Sr etc.] and perhaps as a DPA-Ca amino

complex.”

Thus, since each diﬀerent type of spore would have its own unique mixture of metals and

amino acids, it may be the case that the ﬁner details of the Raman spectra would contain

spore speciﬁc “ﬁngerprints.” This conjecture is supported by Fig. 2b where the diﬀerence

between the DPA Raman spectra of the spores of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus megaterium

is encouraging.

The open question is: to what extent is the DPA Raman spectra sensitive to its envi-

ronment? That signiﬁcant sensitivity could be the case is consistent with the well known

fact that substituents, e.g., NO2 experience a substantial shift of their vibrational frequen-

cies when bound in diﬀerent molecular conﬁgurations, see Fig. 18. Furthermore, recent

NMR experiments [49] show that there may be spore speciﬁc ﬁngerprints due to the local

environment (see Fig. 19).

Clearly there are many oportunities and open questions implicate in FAST CARS “molec-

ular melody” approach to real time spectroscopy. However it plays out, the combination of

quantum coherence and coherent control promises to be a fascinating area of research.

APPENDIX A: THREE LEVEL SYSTEM DRIVEN BY TWO FIELDS

In this appendix we consider the density matrix approach to the Raman scattering and

discuss various limiting cases. In particular we present a semiclassical treatment in which

the ﬁeld evolution is described by Maxwell’s equations and the atomic system by the density

We consider a three level atomic system in the Λ conﬁguration with upper level a and

lower levels b and c. The a

b transition is driven by a ﬁeld at frequency ν1 and the a

→

transition is coupled via a signal ﬁeld at frequency ν2.

The Maxwell’s equations lead to the following equation for the evolution of the signal

where E is the electric ﬁeld vector of the emitted light, µo is the vacuum permeability, and

P is the medium polarization. We write the electric ﬁeld using the slowly varying envelope

and write the polarization in terms of the slowly varying quantity P as

FIG. 20: Schematic diagram of the Raman interaction for the three-state system. The

driving ﬁelds 1 and 2 are in Raman resonance with the two lower levels b and c, but

are generally oﬀ-resonant with the transitions to the excited state a (with detuning ∆).

Decoherence and decay of the optical transitions ab and ac are characterized by the rates

γab and γac, the spontaneous decay rate of level b to c is γ1, and the decoherence rate of

the bc transition is γbc.

Here we recall the main results of [34] and apply them to our physical situation (see Fig.

20). First we deﬁne the decay rates

Here the decay rates from a to b is γb, and from a to c is γc, and γ = γb+γc. Population decay

rate from b to c is γ1. Purely phase decays are designated by the superscript p. Complex

following we present the main properties of ̺cb for various experimental and conceptual

conﬁgurations and consider various limiting cases for the Raman processes.

First we consider the Raman eﬀect far from electronic resonance (∆

case the upper level a is almost completely depopulated and can be eliminated from the

In the case of strong driving the transition between states b and c can be saturated so

that both these levels are signiﬁcantly populated (with virtually no population in the excited

state a). In particular, one obtains from Eq. (A15) the steady state populations of the lower

levels

coherence decay rates T2 and T ∗2 spoil the eﬀect? These and other questions need to be

addressed by careful experiments and further analysis.

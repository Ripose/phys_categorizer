Abstract. We introduce fractional Brownian motion processes (fBm) as an
alternative model for the turbulent index of refraction. These processes allow to
reconstruct most of the index properties, but they are not diﬀerentiable. We overcome
the apparent impossibility of their use in the variational equation coming from
the Fermat’s Principle with the introduction of a Stochastic Calculus. Afterwards,
we successfully provide a solution for the stochastic ray equation; moreover,
its
implications in the statistical analysis of experimental data is discussed.

1. Introduction

Diverse experimental techniques have been devoted to the study of the optical properties
of the turbulent atmosphere. Most of these techniques are based on the analysis of the
ouput of laser beams making their way through it. But also, controlled experiences had
been developed for the laboratory, such as the experiments performed by Consortini et
al
[1, 2, 3]. These experiences apply Geometric Optics to interpret the data acquired.
This analysis has its theoretical grounds on the precursor paper by P. Beckman [4], who
was able to ﬁnd a nice relationship between the variance of the turbulent refractive index
µ(r)–being homogeneous and isotropic–and the variance of the laser beam wandering
over a screen. This derivation, however, is based upon the strong assumption that the
stochastic process is smooth enough to allow continuity in its derivatives.

This assumption has serious problems when checked against Tatarsk˘ı’s foundational
work about lightwave propagation through turbulent atmosphere [5]. A short revision
of the covariance of the turbulent index of refraction found by him shows that the
stochastic process associated is nowhere diﬀerentiable [6].

However, the model introduced by Beckmann is just one of the many used during the
last 40 years to solve imaging problems through the atmosphere, with relative success.

This work was carried out while visiting the Mathematisches Institut at the Friedrich-Schiller-

†
Universit¨at in Jena, Germany.

In fact, it is clear that the stochastic properties of the refractive index in Atmospheric
Optics have never been fully understood nor explained. For instance, most works treated
it like a Gaussian process [7, 8], some others suggested stationary increments, while other
works have proposed the use of non-Gaussian statistics. Ishimaru’s book [9] presents an
extensive description of these works.

Simultaneously, over the last decade an intense debate in Fluid Dynamics has been
carried out about whether or not passive scalar ﬁelds, among which is the turbulent
refractive index, behave like the velocity ﬁeld. That is, under which circumstances they
inherit the stochastic properties of the turbulent velocity u(r), which is a Gaussian
process that follows the Kolmogorov reﬁned similarity hypotheses inside the inertial
range,

It was shown [10, 11] that passive scalars ﬁelds are nearly gaussian as far as l0 ≪
and are unsatisfactory modeled either by log-normal distributions, or the so called
Frisch’s β-model. Eﬀectively, in the inertial range, these ﬁelds obey a law resembling
the Kolmogorov’s law for the velocity ﬁelds. Moreover, they do not present the multi-
fractal property due to intermittence whenever an isotropic velocity ﬁeld is present [12],
i.e. ζn ≡
0. Hence, the behavior of the turbulent refractive index predicted by Tatarsk˘ı
has been conﬁrmed and extended.

In the meantime, Stolovitzky and Sreenivasan [13]

successfully obtained
equation (1) modeling the turbulent velocity ﬁeld as a fractional Brownian motion
(fBm). But this model failed to replicate the intermittent property. It must be stressed
that Kolmogorov reﬁned similarity hypotheses also implies that the velocity ﬁeld is
independent of the dissipated energy probability distribution.

According to what we pointed out here, the fBm processes seem to be a good
alternative model for the turbulent refractive index. First, they are gaussian, and second,
they let us test the Structure Function’s power factor. Also, they are continuos but
nowhere diﬀerentiable, as it results from the application of the Kolmogorov hypotheses
In few words, the fractional Brownian motion model for
to the refractive index.
the turbulent index of refraction describes closer the turbulent properties of passive
scalar ﬁelds than Beckmann’s proposed model. However, a mathematical diﬃculty is
introduced since we have lost diﬀerentiability in the usual sense, and as a consequence
we cannot appeal to the variational methods used in Geometric Optics. Our task here
will be to show how using Stochastic Calculus techniques (for a ﬁrst introduction we

refer the reader to Øksendal [14, 15]) this situation can be overridden providing an
explicit solution to the ray propagation through air in turbulent motion. Besides the
intrinsic complexity of these tools, our model is meant to provide a bridge between the
stochastic processes and the experimental data. Also, we will gain knowledge about
problems handling (geodesic) stochastic equations in Optics.

(cid:19)

The solution to this equation is interpreted as the ray trajectory, which we shall denote
here as q(τ ). The parameter τ has, in principle, no physical meaning. In Optics Treatises
this parameter is usually replaced with one of the trajectory coordinates, which fulﬁlls
dqi/dτ > 0, and is thus called the propagation direction. But the election of this
parameter can not be done at will [16], since, for any parameterization chosen, the

which indicates that the choice of coordinates and momenta is not free.

Now, the degeneracy of the Lagragian can be worked out in the Hamiltonian
framework using the constraint we have just found. This problem of constrained
Hamiltonians is known as Dirac’s problem in the literature [18]. The procedure is
as follows: ﬁrst, deﬁne the constraint function

2.2. Linearizing the Trajectory Equations

The ray equations we have just found are nonlinear, so in this section we are going to
linearize them and at the same time deﬁne the parameter τ . Therefore, let n be the
refractive index of the medium and n0 its average, we write

n2(q) = n2

0 + αǫ(q),

ǫ(q) represents a perturbation ﬁeld with its intensity measured by α. We also assume
that it contains all the inhomogeneities of the media, so when α = 0 the index is
constant. Now we express the solution to (15) in a power series on α:

q(τ ) = q0 + αq1 + α2q2 +

.

· · ·

Although we can also develop a series for the constraint function λ, it is far more
convenient to set its value beforehand. Let us rewrite the ﬁrst equation in (15) as follows

need a bit more than algebra.

The turbulent refractive index measures the separation between the index of
refraction and its average; µ(r) := n(r)
n0.
It is a small quantity, that is how its
−
increments are often replaced in the literature by those of the permitivity. This passive
scalar ﬁeld follows the Kolmovorv reﬁned hypotheses in the inertial range, and so its

If the turbulence is isotropic and homogeneous then the Kolmogorov hypotheses sets

deﬁnition (17), we propose the following:

and together with boundary condition (23) makes the component along the z-axis null
all over the ray trajectory. Of course, this condition agrees with the corresponding
dynamical equation (21). So we are left with a diﬀerential equation for the perpendicular
displacements to the direction of propagation. Finally, we multiply these displacements
by α, and write the ﬁrst-order equation as

d2
dz2 Q =

0 ∇qǫ (zˇez + Q) .

We must provide a context to understand the previous equation. That is, a
stochastic equation is not only determined by the type of process (the fractional
Brownian motion in our case) attached to it, but also by the integro-diﬀerential theory
employed to deﬁne its derivatives. Moreover, there are distinctive stochastic integration
1/2 [21]. Here we are going to make use of
methods whether H > 1/2 or H
the Stochastic Calculus exposed in the appendix, so only the H > 1/2 case will be
considered. By doing so, we are tacitly assuming the presence of strong intermittent
turbulence, in the following sense,

≤

(34)

.

This situation could be observed in a laboratory if an isotropic velocity ﬁeld can not
achieved by the experimental setup.

Because the turbulent refractive index oscillates around its mean value,
it is
expected that the light wanders around the z-axis over the screen. So the solution we
are looking for must have expectation zero. This can easily achieved by the formalism
we are employing: the stochastic integrals (formally known as fractional Itˆo integrals)
deﬁned by the fractional white noise and Wick product on fractional Hida spaces have
expectation zero. Henceforth, from deﬁnition (26) we can calculate the gradient of the
index of refraction; we have, using the continuity and diﬀerential properties for the

fractional Brownian motion–equations (A.27) and (A.30)–in

The fractional white noise is a functional on the real line and its composition with

4. Ray-light Statistics: An Example

In this section we will use the stochastic ray-equation solution to study the statistical
properties of the turbulent refractive index. Both coordinates of displacement are
independent, and they also hold the same (non-coupled) diﬀerential equation. There is
enough to consider the 1-dimensional then. The parameter election (16), we have used
in our treatment, also deﬁnes the meanining of the transversal velocities, for they are
the angles of deviation. Being the velocities continuous we can set,

˙Q0 := lim
ǫ→0

˙Q(ǫ) = θ

∗
H .

|ǫ=0 ∈ S

Since our solution is dependent of the initial refractive angle θ, its behavior at the
boundary, ǫ
0, must be known. This boundary is just the interface between turbulent

and resting air. Henceforth, we will also model the initial angle as a fractional Brownian
motion,

θ(ǫ) = c

χ[0,ǫ)(s) dBH

s = c BH(ǫ),

R+

Z

(64)

the constant c is adimensional and mesures the strength of the noise. The length ǫ
functions as a kind of correlation distance, as it goes to zero we are examining the
properties of the interface’s short-range correlation.

Besides, any stochastic process can be put in terms of the spans described in the
appendix, and these depend on the construction of stochastic integrals by step functions.
So, even if the former model needs to be corrected–maybe the interface introduces long-
range correlations–the next results are useful; since, they are the building blocks for
more complex stochastic processes.

The solution (47) is written using the chaos expansion (57) and the initial

conditions:

In this paper we provided a fractional Brownian motion model for the turbulent index of
refraction; afterwards, we used this model to build a stochastic ray-equation–a stochastic
Volterra equation. We have given a (unique) solution. Our analysis just covers the
H > 1/2 case which is meant for non-isotropic turbulence. These Hurst exponents
disagree with those employed in optical experiments, for the turbulence is assumed
nearly isotropic and homogeneous. We pretend to give a glimpse of the H
1/2
problem from the solution we have found.

≤

In particular, this solution strongly depends on the initial conditions; our election
of the initial angle at the example is the natural choice given the behavior of scalar
quantities in turbulence. Under this condition, we apply solution (78) to estimate the
centroid’s variance of a laser beam at a distance L:

1/2 the variance of the displacement approaches to C 2
notice that this behavior is the same found in Consortini et al [3]. But it not comes
from the isotropic Kolmogorov’s law, with the hyphoteses made at the introduction it
corresponds to a Brownian motion (H = 1/2). That is, given a gaussian process with
Structure Function’s power as in (1) the result from Consortini does not follow. We
1/6; shortly,
have shown this can only be achieved on non-isotropic conditions, for ζn ց
the Beckman’s hyphoteses [4] do not apply to gaussian models used in Fluis Dynamics.
Nevertheless, the approach we have introduced is just the begining of a long journey,
[1/3, 1/2). By doing so,

since we must examine the stochastic ray-equation when H

∈

The fBm property of the turbulent refractive index and the Fermat’s Principle

15

we will conﬁrm that the power law for the variance of the displacements is univocally
determined and no discontinuities arise, equation (79) is still valid. But, this will require
the introduction of other tools–even new for the Stochastic Analysis–since in this range
any smoothness property of the fBm processes is lost [23], and this inquiry will be the
topic of future works.

A step further should be considered afterward. The proposed model for the
turbulent index of refraction (26) just aproximates the Structure Function. After we
give a solution to the stochastic ray-equation for the whole range of Hurst paremeters
with this model, we will start examining other functionals of the fractional Brownian
motion, which reﬁnes our theoretical results against observed properties.

I would like to exppress my gratitude to the Antorchas Foundation, who support my
stay in Jena. To Prof. Dr. Martina Z¨ahle for the helpful discussions about fractional
Stochastic Calculus in the development of this paper and her guidance in this new topic.

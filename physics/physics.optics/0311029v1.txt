ABSTRACT: The derivation of a new condition for characterizing isotropic
dielectric–magnetic materials exhibiting negative phase velocity, and the
equivalence of that condition with previously derived conditions, are pre-
sented.

Keywords: negative phase velocity, power ﬂow

1. INTRODUCTION

Non–dissipative mediums with both simultaneously negative permittiv-
ity and permeability were ﬁrst investigated by Veselago [1] in 1968. These
mediums support electromagnetic wave propagation in which the phase ve-
locity is antiparallel to the direction of energy ﬂow, and other unusual elec-
tromagnetic eﬀects such as the reversal of the Doppler eﬀect and Cerenkov
radiation. After the publication of Veselago’s work, more than three decades
went by for the actual realization of artiﬁcial materials that are eﬀectively
isotropic, homogeneous, and possess negative real permittivity and perme-
ability in some frequency range [2, 3].

When dissipation is included in the analysis, a general condition for the

1

constitutive parameters of an isotropic dielectric–magnetic medium to have
phase velocity directed oppositely to the power ﬂow, was reported about two
years ago [4]: Most importantly, according to that condition, the real parts
of both the permittivity and the permeability need not be both negative.

In this communication, we derive a new condition for characterizing
isotropic materials with negative phase velocity. Although this new con-
dition looks very diﬀerent from its predecessor [4], we also show here the
equivalence between both conditions.

2. THE NEW CONDITION

Let us consider a linear isotropic dielectric–magnetic medium charac-
terized by complex–valued relative permittivity and relative permeability
scalars ǫ = ǫr + iǫi and µ = µr + iµi. An exp(
iωt) time–dependence is
implicit, with ω as the angular frequency.

The wave equation gives the square of the complex–valued refractive

index n = nr + ini as

⇒

i + 2inrni = µrǫr −

µiǫi + i(µiǫr + µrǫi) .

(1)

The sign of nr gives the phase velocity direction, whereas the sign of the
real part of n/µ, i.e.,

gives the directon of power ﬂow [4]. Therefore, for this medium to have
negative phase velocity and positive power ﬂow, the following conditions
should hold simultaneously:

Re(cid:16)

n
µ (cid:17) = nrµr + niµi ,

nr < 0 ,
nrµr + niµi > 0 ,

Equation (1) yields the biquadratic equation

r −

(µrǫr −

µiǫi) n

(µiǫr + µrǫi) = 0 .

This equation has only two real–valued solutions for nr, viz.,

nr =

Noting that the relation

µiǫi −

µrǫr < q(µiǫi −

µrǫr)2 + (µiǫr + µrǫi)2

holds for all values of the constitutive parameters ǫr,i and µr,i, we see that

0 <

µ

ǫ
|

|

+ µrǫr −

µiǫi ;

hence, the right side of (6) is always positive.

As the negative square root must be chosen in (6) in order to satisfy the

condition (3), therefore

nr =

1/2 .

µiǫi(cid:17)

On using these expressions and (2) in the condition (4), a condition for power
ﬂow and phase velocity in opposite directons is ﬁnally derived as follows:

ǫ
µr(cid:16)|

| |

µ

|

+ µrǫr −

µiǫr + µrǫi
+ µrǫr −

µiǫi(cid:17)

µ

ǫ

|

1/2 < 0 .

(11)

This condition can be rewritten in the very simple form

µ
ǫr|
which is the chief contribution of this communication.

ǫ
+ µr|

< 0 ,

3. EQUIVALENCE WITH PREVIOUSLY DERIVED CONDI-
TION

The general condition derived for the phase velocity to be oppositely

directed to the power ﬂow about two years ago [4] is as follows:

Although it looks very diﬀerent, this condition, which can be rewritten as

ǫ
(cid:16)|

| −

µ
ǫr(cid:17) (cid:16)|

µr(cid:17) > ǫi µi .

is completely equivalent to the new condition (12).

Clearly, if (12) is satisﬁed, then, taking into account the validity of (8),
(14) also is. To show that the reverse is also true, we start from (14) and
assume that (12) does not hold. As the left side of the inequality (14) is
non–negative, squaring both sides does not change the sense of the inequality
and we get

+ µr|

|(cid:17)

ǫ
< (cid:16)|

||

µ

|

+ µrǫr −

2
µiǫi(cid:17)

.

Simpliﬁcation of this inequality leads to

ǫ

µ

But causality dictates that ǫi ≥

µiǫi(cid:17) < 0 .

0; hence, we must conclude that

µ

|

||

|

+ µrǫr −

µiǫi < 0 ,

in contradiction with Eq. (8). Therefore, we must accept the validity of
the condition (12). This completes the demonstration of the equivalence
between conditions (12) and (13).

4. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We note in passing that both conditions (12) and (13) are also equivalent

to the condition

ǫrµi + µrǫi < 0 ,

(18)

reported very recently [5]. This condition is due to R. Ruppin.

To conclude, we have here derived a simple new condition for the consti-
tutive parameters of a linear isotropic dielectric–magnetic medium to have
phase velocity opposite to the directon of power ﬂow, and we have demon-
strated its equivalence with previously derived conditions.

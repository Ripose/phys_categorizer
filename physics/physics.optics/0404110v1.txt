We suggest using an evanescent wave around a thin ﬁber to trap atoms. We show that the gradient
force of a red-detuned evanescent-wave ﬁeld in the fundamental mode of a silica ﬁber can balance the
centrifugal force when the ﬁber diameter is about two times smaller than the wavelength of the light
and the component of the angular momentum of the atoms along the ﬁber axis is in an appropriate
range. As an example, the system should be realizable for Cesium atoms at a temperature of less
than 0.29 mK using a silica ﬁber with a radius of 0.2 µm and a 1.3-µm-wavelength light with a
power of about 27 mW.

A current-carrying metallic wire and a photon-carrying
dielectric wire are the simplest conﬁgurations for trap-
ping and guiding cold particles. Blumel and Dietrich [1]
considered the possibility of binding very cold neutrons
through a magnetic trapping potential created by a thin
wire with a current. Similar waveguides have been pro-
posed and lately realized for binding cold neutral atoms
[2, 3]. The optical force from a dielectric wire carrying
photons can also be used to trap and guide cold atoms
[4]. Such an atom guide is made from a hollow opti-
cal ﬁber with light propagating in the glass and tuned
far to blue of atomic resonance [5, 6]. Inside the ﬁber,
the evanescent wave decays exponentially away from the
wall, producing a repulsive potential which guides atoms
along the center axis. Alternatively, a red-detuned light
in the hollow center of the ﬁber can also be used to guide
atoms [3].
In several experiments [7], cold atoms have
been trapped and guided inside a hollow ﬁber where the
optical dipole force conﬁned them on axis.

FIG. 1: Schematic of atom trapping and guiding around an
optical ﬁber.

In this Rapid Communication, we present a method for
trapping and guiding neutral atoms around a thin optical
ﬁber. Our scheme is based on the use of a subwavelength-
diameter silica ﬁber with a red-detuned light launched
into it. The light wave decays away from the ﬁber wall
and produces an attractive potential for neutral atoms.
The atom trapping and guiding occur in the outside of
the ﬁber. To sustain a stable trapping and guiding, the
atoms have to be kept away from the ﬁber wall. This
can be achieved by the centrifugal potential barrier. The
centrifugal potential barrier can compensate all the po-
tentials which diverge less rapidly than r−2 as r → 0.
We show that this can be achieved only when the ﬁber
diameter is subwavelength. (Nowadays thin ﬁbers can be
produced with diameters down to 50 nm [8].)

Note that one can manipulate a very thin silica ﬁber
using taper ﬁber technology. The essence of the tech-
nology is to heat and pull a single-mode optical ﬁber
to a very thin thickness maintaining the taper condition
to keep adiabatically the single-mode condition [9]. The
thin ﬁber has an almost vanishing core. Hence, the re-
fractive indices that determine the ﬁber modes are the
cladding refractive index nf and the refractive index n0
of the medium surrounding the ﬁber. The cladding index
nf will be referred as the ﬁber refractive index hence-
forth.

Consider an atom moving around an optical ﬁber, see
Fig. 1. We assume that the potential U of the atom is
cylindrically symmetric, that is, U depends on the ra-
dial distance r from the atom to the ﬁber axis z, but not
on two other cylindrical coordinates ϕ and z. Due to
this symmetry, the component Lz of the angular mo-
mentum of the atom is conserved.
In the eigenstate
problem, we have Lz = ¯hm, where m is an integer,
called the rotational quantum number. The centrifu-
gal potential of the atom is repulsive and is given by
(m2 − 1/4)/2M r2. The radial motion of the
Ucf = ¯h
atom can be treated as the one-dimensional motion of a
particle in the eﬀective potential Ueﬀ = Ucf + U .

2

There exist stable bound states for the atom if Ueﬀ has

a local minimum at a distance r = rm outside the ﬁber.
This may happen only if the potential U is attractive,
opposite to the centrifugal potential Ucf . To produce such
a potential U , we send an optical ﬁeld through the ﬁber.
This ﬁeld generates an evanescent wave around the ﬁber,
whose steep variation in the transverse plane leads to a
gradient force on the atom. We assume that the atom is
initially in the ground state and the detuning ∆ of the
ﬁeld from the dominant atomic line is large compared to
the Rabi frequency Ω and the linewidth γ. Then, the
optical potential of the gradient force is given by [10, 11]
U = ¯hΩ2/∆. We choose a red detuning (∆ < 0) for the
ﬁeld to make U an attractive potential.

We assume that the ﬁber is suﬃciently thin that it
has a vanishing core and it can support only a single,
fundamental mode HE11 [12]. The ﬁber mode charac-
teristics are then determined by the ﬁber radius a, the
light wavelength λ, the ﬁber refractive index nf , and the
refractive index n0 of the surrounding environment. In
the linear-polarization approximation, the spatial depen-
dence of the amplitude of the ﬁeld outside the ﬁber is
described by the modiﬁed Bessel function K0(qr). Here
the parameter q = 1/Λ is the inverse of the character-
istic decay length Λ of the evanescent-wave ﬁeld and is
determined by the ﬁber eigenvalue equation [12]. Then,
the optical potential outside the ﬁber can be written as
U = −GK 2
0 (qa) is the cou-
pling constant for the interaction between the evanescent
wave and the atom. Here Ωa is the Rabi frequency of the
ﬁeld at the ﬁber surface.

0 (qr), where G = −¯hΩ2

a/∆K 2

It should be noted here that the ﬁeld distribution E(r)
corresponding to the fundamental mode HE11 of the ﬁber
has three nonzero components Er, Eϕ, and Ez, which
have azimuthal variation and therefore are not cylindri-
cally symmetric. The cylindrical symmetry of the ﬁeld in
the fundamental mode appears only in the framework of
the linear-polarization approximation for weakly guided
modes. Although this approximation is good for conven-
tional ﬁbers, it may be questionable for thin ﬁbers since
nf and n0 are very diﬀerent from each other. A simple
general way to produce a cylindrically symmetric optical
potential is to use a circularly polarized light. The time
average of the potential of such a ﬁeld is cylindrically
symmetric on the slow time scale of the atomic center-
of-mass motion.

The eﬀective potential for the radial motion of the
atom in the optical potential U can be written in the
form

Ueﬀ (r) = θrec

where θrec = (¯hk)2/2M is the recoil energy and g =
G/θrec is the normalized coupling parameter. Here M is
the mass of the atom and k is the wave number of the
ﬁeld. At the local minimum point rm, the derivative of
Ueﬀ(r) is zero. Hence, we ﬁnd rm = xm/q, where xm is
a solution of the equation

f (x) = M,

with f (x) = x3K0(x)K1(x) and M = (m2 − 1/4)q2/gk2.

The function f (x) achieves its peak value fc
∼= 0.9331. The condition for the existence of rm is
at xc
M < fc. When this condition is satisﬁed, Eq. (2) has
two solutions. The smaller one corresponds to the local
minimum point rm of Ueﬀ (r) and the larger one corre-

relation xm < xc that rm < xcΛ ∼= 0.9331 Λ. Thus the
distance from the local minimum point rm of the eﬀective
optical potential to the ﬁber axis is always shorter than
the decay length Λ of the evanescent wave. The com-
parison of the requirement rm > a with the inequality
rm < xcΛ yields

qa < xc

∼= 0.9331

(3)

or, equivalently, a < xcΛ ∼= 0.9331 Λ. As shown below,
the condition (3) can be satisﬁed only when the size pa-
rameter ka of the ﬁber is small enough. On the other
hand, the requirement rm > a can be satisﬁed only when
fa < M, where fa = f (xa) with xa = qa. Combining the
conditions fa < M and M < fc and using the explicit
expression for M, we obtain

fa < (m2 − 1/4)

gk2 < fc.

Thus stable bound states of the atom may exist only
if mmin ≤ m ≤ mmax, where mmin and mmax are
fagk2/q2 + 1/4 and
the integer numbers closest to
fcgk2/q2 + 1/4, respectively. Note that an increase in
m leads to an increase in the position rm as well as a
p
decrease in the depth −Ueﬀ(rm) of the local minimum
of the eﬀective optical potential. In addition, the depth
−Ueﬀ(rm) increases with increasing the coupling param-
eter g.

p

We calculate the decay parameter q for the evanes-
cent wave of the fundamental mode HE11 by solving the
exact eigenvalue equation for the ﬁber [12]. We show
in Fig. 2(a) the characteristic dimensionless parameters
Λ/λ and qa as functions of the ﬁber size parameter a/λ.
We ﬁnd from the ﬁgure that the condition (3) is satisﬁed
when

a/λ < 0.283,

(5)

that is, when the ﬁber is thin compared to the wavelength
of the trapping light. The penetration length Λ is plotted
in Fig. 2(b) as a function of the light wavelength λ for
various values of the ﬁber radius a. In these calculations,
we took into account the dispersion of the silica-glass
ﬁber index nf . The ﬁgure shows that the condition (3)
is satisﬁed when λ > 0.72, 1.06, 1.41, 1.75, and 2.09 µm
for a = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 µm, respectively.

When the atom is near to the ﬁber surface, we must
take into account the van der Waals force. The van der
Waals potential of an atom near the surface of a cylindri-
cal dielectric rod has been calculated by Boustimi et al.
[13]. We use their general formula to calculate the van

a cylindrical silica ﬁber. We plot the results in Fig. 3.
As seen, when r is ﬁxed, a larger ﬁber radius a leads to
a deeper and steeper van der Waals potential. When the
van der Waals force is substantial, the eﬀect of the cen-
trifugal potential may be reduced and, consequently, the
local minimum point rm of the eﬀective optical potential
Ueﬀ may be washed out in the total eﬀective potential
Utot = Ueﬀ + V . To reduce the eﬀect of the van der
Waals force, we need a thin ﬁber. Around such a ﬁber,

FIG. 4: Total eﬀective potential Utot of a ground-state cesium
atom in the outside of a silica ﬁber with the radius of 0.2 µm.
The wavelength and the coupling parameter of the trapping
light are λ = 1.3 µm and g = 5330, respectively. The recoil
energy is θrec = 888 Hz = 42.6 nK.

the total eﬀective potential Utot may have a local mini-
mum point near to rm. On the other hand, we can also
reduce the eﬀect of the van der Waals force by increasing
rm. For a ﬁxed value of the coupling parameter g, we
can increase rm by considering orbits with larger values
of the rotational quantum number m.

We now perform numerical calculations for the total
eﬀective potential Utot of a ground-state cesium atom
in the outside of a thin cylindrical silica ﬁber. To trap
atoms, we use light with the wavelength λ = 1.3 µm.
The ﬁber radius is chosen to be a = 0.2 µm = 0.154 λ,
which is small enough to satisfy the condition (5) and
to reduce the eﬀect of the van der Waals force. The
penetration length of the trapping light from the ﬁber
is found to be Λ ∼= 2.42 µm = 12.1 a. The coupling
parameter g should be large to produce a strong dipole
force leading to an eﬀective optical potential with a deep
local minimum point. For the calculations, we choose
g = 5330. Then, the condition (4) yields the lower and
upper boundary values mmin = 114 and mmax = 430
for the range of m where the eﬀective optical Ueﬀ has
a local minimum point rm outside the ﬁber. For the
calculations, we choose m = 220, 230, and 240. These
values are not only in the interval (mmin, mmax) but also
are suﬃciently large that rm is far away from the range
of substantial action of the van der Waals force. We then
expect that the total eﬀective potential Utot has a local
minimum point near to the point rm.

We plot in Fig. 4 the results of our calculations for
Utot. As seen, the total eﬀective potential has a deep
minimum point, which is located more than 0.4 µm far
away from the ﬁber axis, not only well outside the ﬁber
but also outside the range of substantial action of the
van der Waals force. We observe that an increase in the
rotational quantum number m leads to an increase in the

m of the local minimum point and a decrease in
its depth −Utot(r′
m). We note that, in the region of r ≃ a,
the shape of Utot is similar to that of the attractive van
der Waals potential V . However, in the region of r ≫ a,
where V is weak, Utot practically coincides with Ueﬀ.

The existence of a deep local minimum of the potential
Utot leads to the existence of bound states of the atom.
In Fig. 5, we plot the wave functions un for the ﬁrst ﬁve
energy levels of the radial motion of a cesium atom in
the potential Utot. Since the potential is deep, the lower
levels practically do not depend on the van der Waals
potential. They are mainly determined by the eﬀective
optical potential Ueﬀ . However, the upper levels, which
are not shown in the ﬁgure, are sensitive to the van der
Waals potential and also to the boundary condition at the
ﬁber surface. Tunneling from such highly excited levels
into the narrow potential well between the repulsive hard-

4

core potential and the attractive van der Waals potential
may occur.

The experimental realization of bound states requires
the binding energy of atoms to be larger than their typ-
ical thermal kinetic energy. In the case of Fig. 5, the
energy of the ground state is E0 ∼= −6716 θrec. Since
Utot(r = ∞) = 0, the binding energy of an atom in the
ground state is EB = Utot(r = ∞) − E0 ∼= 6716 θrec ∼=
0.29 mK. Thus we can trap cesium atoms around the
ﬁber at a temperature of less than 0.29 mK.

The tangential component of transverse velocity of an
atom spinning around the ﬁber at the distance rm is given
by vT = Lz/M rm = ¯hm/M rm. For a cesium atom spin-
ning in a bound state with m = 230 and rm = 0.5 µm, we
∼= 0.22 m/s. The kinetic energy of this rotational
ﬁnd vT
T /2 ∼= 1 mK. This energy is larger than the
motion is M v2
binding energy and consequently than the allowed value
of the average thermal kinetic energy estimated above.

We note that the coupling parameter g = 5330 corre-
sponds to the ﬁeld intensity of 1 MW/cm2 at the ﬁber
surface with the radius of 0.2 µm. Such an intensity is
large, but it can be easily generated since the ﬁber is
thin. In fact, the power of light corresponding to such an
intensity is estimated to be about 27 mW, a very ordi-
nary value for the laser light with the wavelength of 1.3
µm.

In conclusions, we have suggested and analyzed a
method for trapping atoms based on the use of an evanes-
cent wave around a thin silica ﬁber. We have shown that
the gradient force of a red-detuned evanescent-wave ﬁeld
in the fundamental mode of a silica ﬁber can balance the
centrifugal force when the ﬁber diameter is about two
times smaller than the light wavelength and the compo-
nent of the angular momentum of the atoms along the
ﬁber axis is in an appropriate range. Since optical ﬁbers
oﬀer the possibility of engineering evanescent ﬁelds, the
system can be used to store, move, and manipulate cold
atoms in a controlled manner. The system may prove
useful as a waveguide for matter waves.

Abstract

We study experimentally and theoretically the polarization alternation during the switch-on

transient of a quasi-isotropic CO2 laser emitting on the fundamental mode. The observed transient

dynamics is well reproduced by means of a model which provides a quantitative discrimination

between the intrinsic asymmetry due to the kinetic coupling of molecules with diﬀerent angular

momenta, and the extrinsic anisotropies, due to a tilted intracavity window. Furthermore, the

experiment provides a numerical assignment for the decay rate of the coherence term for a CO2

laser.

INTRODUCTION

Laser dynamics is commonly studied considering the electric ﬁeld as a scalar variable,

since in most systems the polarization state is imposed by anisotropies of the cavity. For

instance, Brewster windows or gratings, generally used in gas lasers to close the laser tube or

to select a vibro-rotational transition, impose a linearly polarized state of the laser emission.

However, in perfectly cylindrical laser cavities without any elements to select a preferred

polarization, the study of the dynamics includes the necessity of considering the vector

nature of the electric ﬁeld.

Several theoretical works have been devoted to the study of the polarization dynamics

of the quasi-isotropic laser, showing the important role played by the material variables. In

particular, the degeneracy of the angular momentum states of the laser transition sublevels

has been considered as the coupling source between diﬀerent polarization states.

Initial

studies considered only stationary solutions [1, 2], but more recently dynamical models have

been developed to explore the role of anisotropy due to the laser medium, that from now on

we will call intrinsic anisotropy [3, 4, 5, 6]. These models predict a rich dynamics even for

the simplest transition, J = 1

J = 0. Later versions of these models include also linear

→

and circular cavity anisotropies that we call extrinsic [8, 9], or diﬀerent level structure [10].

However, up to now few experiments have been performed on this subject. Experiments

carried out on noble gas lasers reveal that in some systems it is necessary to consider the

dynamics of the matter variables to fully understand the polarization features of an isotropic

system [2, 11]. In other cases, the observations could be explained by a nonlinear coupling

of the modes and residual cavity anisotropies [13, 14].

In this work we present experimental and theoretical results for the polarization com-

petition dynamics in the transient state of a quasi-isotropic low-pressure CO2 laser. We

show that the polarization dynamics during the switch-on is well described by means of a

model including optical coherences (intrinsic anisotropy) and extrinsic linear anisotropies.

These results extend our previous work in which the coherences were simpliﬁed as a para-

metric cross coupling between the matter polarization and electric ﬁelds [15], and provide a

quantitative comparison between the amount of anisotropy due to the coupling of molecular

angular momenta and that induced by an intracavity window. Furthermore, the decay rate

of the coherences, deﬁned in Ref.

[3], is shown explicitly to be closer to the decay rate of

2

the population inversion rather than to the decay rate of the induced polarization.

II. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The experiment has been performed using an unpolarized Fabry-Perot cavity as shown

in Fig. 1. A total reﬂective ﬂat mirror (M1, reﬂectivity R1=1) and an outcoupler mirror

(M2) with a reﬂectivity R2 = 0.914 set the cavity length at L =75 cm. A piezo translator

(Pzt) is used to select the P(20) laser emission line and to adjust the laser detuning.

The active medium, a mixture of He (82%), N2 (13.5%) and CO2 (4.5%) at a pressure

of 25 mbar, is pumped by a DC discharge ﬁxed at 6.1 mA when the threshold current is 3

mA.

3.

As we are interested in the transient dynamics, an intracavity chopper is used to induce

a switch-on event at a repetition rate of 200 Hz.

In order to control the linear anisotropies of the cavity, a ZnSe anti reﬂection coated

window (W) has been introduced, which can be tilted accurately as shown in Fig.1.

The polarization state of the laser emission has been analyzed by means of a wire grid

polarizer (Pol), which has the property of reﬂecting one linear polarization of the incident

radiation and transmitting the orthogonal one, with an extinction ratio of 1:180. The

reﬂected and transmitted parts of the beam are directed to two HgCdTe fast detectors
(D1, D2, 100 MHz bandwidth), whose sensitive areas (104 µm2) are much smaller than the

beam size. Both signals are recorded on a digital oscilloscope (Lecroy LT423L) with 500

MHz bandwidth.

In the stationary regime, we observe that the laser has two possible linear polarization di-

rections which are orthogonal as far as we can measure. In Fig. 1 these cavity eigendirections

are called H and V respectively.

The window W can rotate by an angle θ around the axis V. When θ = 0, the polarization

direction is determined by the detuning of the cavity, as usual [2, 8, 16]. This is illustrated

in Fig.2(a), where we plot the laser intensity along both eigendirections when the detuning

is varied around the line center. A residual hysteresis around the transition is masked by the

limited resolution of Pzt. At the transition point near the line center there is not a preferred

polarization direction and the laser ﬂips spontaneously from one to other as shown in Fig.

3

Our goal is to study the polarization behavior in this bistable region. In particular, we

analyze of the switch-on transient state, in which the total intensity presents relaxation

oscillations. In our system the pump strength imposes a relaxation frequency of 55 KHz.

When the two polarized components are separated, they show oscillations in relative

antiphase, which do not appear on the total intensity (Fig.4). The amplitude of these

oscillations depends on the angle between the polarizer axes with respect to H-V, reaching

a maximum when the analysis is performed at 45o.

In Fig.4(a) we report an example of these polarization oscillations, when the cavity is

tuned at the center of the line. The total laser output intensity (thick solid line) is displayed

together with its two orthogonally polarized components analyzed at 45o (thin solid and

dashed lines).

These oscillations are always damped until they disappear, with a damping rate depend-

ing on the cavity detuning. Precisely the oscillations are more persistent the closer is the

detuning to the bistable region. This fact points to the competitive origin of the oscilla-

tions. In Fig.4 (c) we show an example of the transient dynamics when the cavity detuning

is slightly moved from resonance. It is worth to note that the system is so sensible to noise

that the duration of the oscillations suﬀers slight variations, without apparent changes in

the conditions.

Successively, we studied the response of the system to small linear anisotropies driven by

the tilt angle θ of the intracavity window W around the vertical axis.

Several parameters of the system are simultaneously aﬀected by this action. As a conse-

quence of the common increasing of the optical path for both polarization eigendirections,

the line center moves with respect to the isotropic condition θ = 0. In order to keep the

bistable condition, the cavity length is varied to recover the resonance.

In Fig.2((b) and (c)) we show the intensity of both polarization components for diﬀerent

θ values, showing that the gain proﬁle is not signiﬁcantly distorted with respect to the

isotropic condition θ = 0 (Fig.2(a)). The detuning anisotropies are measured to be smaller

than 5% of the total change.

The other eﬀect of the tilt angle θ is to increase the cavity losses. In Fig.6 (b) we report

the dependence of the laser intensity on the tilt angle θ which is in agreement with the

expected theoretical behavior [7]. Moreover, since the gain proﬁles for the two polarization

directions do not change due to the tilt angle θ (Fig. 2), we can assume that the induced

4

loss anisotropies remain a small eﬀect (

1%) compared to the total loss change. The eﬀect

≃

of the losses anisotropy can be observed in the residual modulation in the total intensity

(Figs.4 (a),(c)).

The dynamical eﬀect observed when θ is increased is the growing of the frequency of the

polarization oscillations. Measurements made near the resonance condition show that the

frequency rises as the tilt angle increased(Fig.6 (a)). It can be seen that a tilt angle of 12o

is enough to rise the frequency from 100 KHz to 400 KHz.

III. MODEL AND NUMERICAL RESULTS

Our theoretical approach is based on the theory of the isotropic laser developed in Ref.

[3] where the optical coherences between upper levels are considered with the. This theory

was developed for the simplest case (J=1

system is much more complicated (J=19

→

J=0), while the transition involved in our

→
J=20). However, this theory has been showed

to predict also the behavior of lasers with a diﬀerent level structure, as shown in Ref. [11].

Only ﬁrst order coherences (∆m =

1) will be considered. Therefore, independently of the

±

number of sublevels, there are only two kind of possible transitions, which generate a split

of the population in two ensembles, in such a way that an anisotropy is induced in the active

medium [6]. Furthermore we introduce an extrinsic linear anisotropy as done in Ref.[8].

The ﬁeld will be decomposed in a circularly polarized base. Just losses and linear de-

tuning anisotropies along the principal axes of the system will be included, but not circular

asymmetries since our system does not show signs of dicroism. It reads as

PR(~r, t), PR(~r, t) stand for the matter polarization ﬁelds, DR(~r, t) and DL(~r, t) are the re-

spective population inversions. The ﬁeld C(~r, t) represents the coherence between the upper

sublevels. We recall that, in a density matrix treatment, the polarization correspond to oﬀ

diagonal matrix elements between upper and lower level of the radiative transition, whereas

C is proportional to the of diagonal matrix elements coupling diﬀerent angular momentum

states of the upper level [11]. The parameter δ represents the detuning between the cavity

and the atomic transition frequencies. The parameters α = (κV

−

represent respectively the linear anisotropies in the losses and detuning with respect to the

cavity H-V axes, where κV , κH, are the losses in the horizontal and vertical axis, and δV ,

δH are the corresponding detunings.

In our low pressure CO2 laser, the polarization decay is γ⊥ = 4.4

108 s−1 and the
105s−1 [15]. In view of numerical solutions, there is no

·

inversion decay rate as γk = 1.95

·

reason to keep dynamical equations for variables whose decay rates diﬀer by several orders

of magnitude. Depending on whether γc

γk or γc >> γk, we can respectively reduce

≃

the number of diﬀerential equations from 7 to 5 (for ER, EL,C, DR and DL) or 4 (for ER,

EL, DR and DL). In the ﬁrst case, PR, PL are eliminated adiabatically and their values

correspond to the stationary solutions of the third and fourth of Eqs. 1. In the second case

(fast C), also the C variable is eliminated adiabatically and it follows the relatively slow

variations of the ﬁeld and the population inversion. Whether to choose between ﬁve or four

equations depends on the numerical value of γc. The γc parameter represents the coherence

decay rate, whose value should be chosen between γ⊥ and γk [5]. However, this parameter

can not be directly measured, and it will be used as control parameter in order to ﬁt the

theory to the experimental results [8]. We ﬁnd that the optimal value is γc

γk in all cases,

≃

which is also consistent with the observation that just linearly polarized states are found

in the experiment. Indeed, a higher value of γc would give rise to a periodic modulation

of the total intensity [5] which has never been observed in our experiments. Hence, the

coherence C decays on the same time scale as the population inversion and we must keep

the corresponding time dependent equation. Thus our experimental system is dynamically

modeled as a class B laser [12], and Eqs. (1) reduce to the following system of two algebraic

Eqs. (3) show explicitly that the cross ﬁeld coupling is due partly to a molecular coupling

J = 1

J = 0 (intrinsic) and partly to the intracavity window W (extrinsic). Fig. 5

→

provides evidence that the main responsible for the alternation is the intrinsic anisotropy

rather than the extrinsic one. Figure 5 (a) refers to the case where both coherences and

linear anisotropies are acting.

In Fig. 5 (b), the extrinsic anisotropy has been removed.

now the oscillation competition is not damped, but the alternation of the two polarization is

maintained. Finally, in Fig. 5 (c) just the extrinsic anisotropies are acting; the competition

does not appear any more.

From the experimental observations we know that the most important eﬀect of the window

tilting is the increase of the total loss, while the losses and detuning anisotropies represent a

minor eﬀect. In addition, as the excitation current does not change during the experiment,

the increasing of the losses aﬀects the gain to loss ratio. As a consequence, the total losses

κ and pump parameter r are functions of θ as follows [7]:

ar sin(θ)4)
r(θ) = ro(1
−
κ(θ) = κo(1 + ak sin(θ)4)

where ro = 2 and κo =

c
4L log(R) = 4.1

·

−

106 s−1 are the pump strength and total losses

when the tilt angle θ = 0. Here c is the speed of light, L = 0.75 m the cavity length and

R = √R1R2 = 0.956 the mirrors reﬂectivity. the parameters ar = 150 and aκ = 25000 are

related to the reﬂectivity of the window W, and are chosen to ﬁt the experimental results.

7

In Fig. 4 (b) and (d) the numerically generated intensity proﬁles are compared with their

experimental counterparts reported in Fig 4 (a) and (c), respectively. It can be observed that

the intensity proﬁles show antiphase oscillations for both polarization components, while the

total intensity remains unmodulated.

When δ=0, the polarization oscillations remain undamped for any degree of anisotropy.

For δ

= 0, the oscillations are still undamped only in perfect cavity symmetry conditions

α = β = 0. In Fig.4 (d) it can be seen that for δ = 0.05, a detuning or losses anisotropy

of 0.5 % is suﬃcient to damp the oscillation in a few hundred microseconds as observed

in the experiment. In the experimental system unavoidable residual anisotropies break the

cylindrical symmetry, and therefore the polarization oscillations are always damped.

Choosing the resonant condition δ = 0, we observe that the frequency of the oscillations

presents the same dependence on the total losses and pump strength found in the experi-

ment. In Fig. 6 we compare the experimental and numerical angular dependences of the

polarization oscillation frequency (Fig. 6 (a),(c)) and the total intensity (Fig. 6 (b),(d)),

showing good agreements.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have reported an experimental and theoretical study of the transient

polarization dynamics of a quasi-isotropic CO2 laser. A competition between two modes

with orthogonal polarization directions is observed. The competition manifests itself as an

oscillation on the polarized laser ﬁeld, whose features depend on the cavity parameters.

To explain the observed transient polarization alternation, both intrinsic and extrinsic

anisotropies must be considered; the intrinsic ones provide the alternation and the extrinsic

ones provide damping and residual ripple of the total intensity. The numerical results ﬁt

well with the experimental observations, pointing out the importance of matter variables in

the dynamics of a quasi-isotropic laser.

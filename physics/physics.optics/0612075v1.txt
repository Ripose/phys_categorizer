We report the observation of a coherent multimode instability in quantum cascade lasers (QCLs),
which is driven by the same fundamental mechanism of Rabi oscillations as the elusive Risken-
Nummedal-Graham-Haken (RNGH) instability predicted 40 years ago for ring lasers. The thresh-
old of the observed instability is signiﬁcantly lower than in the original RNGH instability, which we
attribute to saturable-absorption nonlinearity in the laser. Coherent eﬀects, which cannot be repro-
duced by standard laser rate equations, can play therefore a key role in the multimode dynamics of
QCLs, and in lasers with fast gain recovery in general.

The fundamental coherent mechanism that can desta-
bilize a single-mode laser was predicted in the early 60s
[1] and was later extended to multi-mode lasers [2, 3]
where it became known as the RNGH instability. These
instabilities became classic landmarks for the general
ﬁeld of nonlinear dynamics [4, 5] because they emerge
in conceptually the simplest laser model, which in the
single-mode case was shown to be equivalent to the
Lorentz model of deterministic chaos [6]. Another feature
that makes these instabilities so interesting and unique is
their coherent nature that involves the polarization of the
medium as a nontrivial dynamical variable. Most other
physical mechanisms that can drive a laser from a single-
mode to a multi-mode regime, such as spatial and spec-
tral hole burning, Q-switching, and saturable absorption
[7, 8], can be adequately described within the standard
rate equation formalism, in which the polarization of the
active medium is adiabatically eliminated. The RNGH
instability and its single-mode twin cannot be explained
by the rate equations. Such coherent eﬀects can be only
observed when the polarization is driven faster than or
comparable to the dephasing time T2 [9].

The origin of both phenomena is the oscillation of the
population inversion at the Rabi frequency ΩRabi that
takes place when the intracavity laser intensity becomes
large. This results in a modiﬁcation of the gain spectrum
and the emergence of sidebands separated from the max-
imum of the gain curve by an amount corresponding to
the Rabi frequency. These sidebands can be regarded as
a manifestation of parametric gain. The instability sets
in when the intracavity power is suﬃciently large: the
Rabi angular frequency ΩRabi has to be greater than the
relaxation timescales of the gain medium (more precisely,
ΩRabi is suﬃciently greater than (T1T2)−1/2, where T1 is
the gain relaxation time). The instability threshold is of-

ten called the second laser threshold due to its universal
nature.

Pioneering theoretical works stimulated extensive ex-
perimental studies that ﬁnally resulted in the observa-
tion of the Lorenz-type chaos in a far-infrared single-
mode laser [10]. However, despite almost 40 years of ef-
forts, the experimental demonstration of the multimode
RNGH instability has remained somewhat controversial
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].

In lasers with long gain recovery compared to the cav-
ity roundtrip time, the instability caused by a saturable
absorber can often lead to mode locking [8]. When the
gain recovery time is short compared with the cavity
round-trip time, it is usually assumed that laser dynamics
becomes very primitive and uninteresting (so-called class
A laser). In this case mode locking is impossible accord-
ing to conventional theory, and the relaxation oscillation
frequency becomes purely imaginary [17]. Surprisingly,
as we show in this Letter, it is under these conditions
that the elusive RNGH instability can be observed. We
show that quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are uniquely
suited for studying these coherent eﬀects which, along
with spatial hole burning (SHB), become a key factor in
dictating the dynamics of the laser.

QCLs, because they are based on ultrafast tunneling
and phonon-limited intersubband transitions, belong to
the class of lasers which have a extremely fast gain recov-
ery, in the range of a few picoseconds [18]. Recent exper-
iments showed indeed that the gain recovers within a few
picoseconds, which is approximately an order of magni-
tude shorter than the cavity round-trip time [19]. Since
its invention in 1994, QCLs have undergone tremendous
improvement [20]. Recent development of low loss, high
power QCLs [21, 22] enables the study of previously
under-investigated aspects, such as the richness of the

optical spectrum and the ultrafast dynamics of these de-
vices. In Ref. [23], strong evidence of self-pulsations at
the cavity roundtrip frequency was reported in QCLs, in
particular a large broadening of the spectrum above the
threshold of this instability was observed. However, no
detailed pulse characterization was provided. The tech-
nological potential of QCLs calls for a better understand-
ing of the interplay of various instabilities in the param-
eter regime dictated by these lasers. Moreover, the Rabi
frequency in QCLs at the power levels of a few hundred
milliwatts is of the order of a few THz, much larger than
the spacing of Fabry-Perot modes. Therefore coherent
eﬀects should be easily observable in QCLs.

In this Letter we present a clear experimental demon-
stration of a coherent instability, driven by the same
mechanism as the RNGH instability. It is identiﬁed in
the most direct manner, by demonstrating in the optical
spectrum of QCLs a splitting corresponding to twice the
Rabi frequency. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst observation of the RNGH mechanism in a semi-
conductor laser and even more generally in a solid-state
laser.

The instability observed diﬀers in some respects from
the original RNGH instability [2, 3]. The threshold of
instability is as low as ∼ 50% above the laser thresh-
In addition, the pure RNGH instability typically

gives rise to spectra with one central mode and two side-
bands separated from it by the Rabi frequency, whereas
in our experiments we observed two peaks only, similarly
to Ref. [11]. However the mechanism of the instability is
the same in essence, namely the Rabi oscillations of the
population inversion due to coherent eﬀects. The dif-
ferences from the RNGH instability as it occurs in ideal

conditions [2, 3] can be attributed to the presence of sat-
urable absorption and SHB.

The QCLs studied were fabricated from two diﬀerent
wafers (wafer # 3251 and 3252) grown by metalorganic
vapor phase epitaxy. The devices were processed into
buried heterostructure lasers, in which an insulating Fe-
doped InP layer is regrown after etching of the ridges
[21, 22]. The active region of all the samples tested is
based on a four-quantum-well design, which rely on a
double phonon resonance to achieve population inver-
sion [24]. Note however that the multimode operation
described in the present letter was also observed with
lasers based on so-called three-quantum-well designs [18].
Fig. 1(a) shows the optical spectra of a laser operated in
continuous wave (cw) at room temperature. The active
region of this laser is 3µm wide and its emission wave-
length is close to 8.38µm (wafer #3251). The laser was
cleaved into a 3.25mm long bar and soldered with Indium
onto a copper heat sink. The spectra were measured
by a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR)
equipped with a deuterated triglycine sulphate (DTGS)
detector.

As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the laser spectrum is single
mode close to threshold and broadens as the pumping
current increases, splitting into two separated humps.
The diﬀerence between the weighted centers of the two
peaks increases linearly as a function of the square root
of the collected output power from one facet, as shown
in Fig. 1 (b) (square dots with the dashed line as its
best-ﬁt). The Rabi angular frequency ΩRabi can be
easily calculated using the formula ΩRabi = µE/~ =
µp2nIave/(cǫ)/~, where µ is the electron charge times
the matrix element of the laser transition (=2.54nm).

Iave is the average intracavity intensity in the gain re-
gion, which can be derived from the measured output
power. c is the speed of light in vacuum and n is the
background refractive index. For all the values of the in-
tensity corresponding to the spectra reported in Fig. 1(a),
ΩRabi was calculated, multiplied by a factor two and then
added to Fig. 2 (b) (solid line). A very good agreement is
found between the experimental splitting and twice the
estimated Rabi frequency. Both curves fall indeed well
within the error bars [25]. As mentioned before, the the-
ory behind the RNGH instability predicts that the large
intracavity intensity will result in parametric gain at fre-
quencies detuned from the maximum of the gain curve
by the Rabi frequency. The agreement mentioned above
is thus a strong indication of the RNGH instability in
QCLs.

In order to better understand the experimental spec-
tra of the QCLs presented in Fig. 1 (a), we use a simple
model based on the standard one-dimensional Maxwell-
Bloch equations [9], where the active medium is described
by an “open” two level system [26]. However contrary to
the standard unidirectional Maxwell-Bloch equations, we
allow the electromagnetic ﬁeld to propagate in both di-
rections. The waves traveling in the two directions are
coupled, as they share the same gain medium. This gives
rise to SHB [7]: The standing wave formed by a cavity
mode imprints a grating in the gain medium through gain
saturation. As a result, other modes become more favor-
able for lasing, and a multimode operation is triggered.

pendent on the intensity. In this work we assume

ℓ(E+, E−) = ℓ0 − γ(|E+|2 + |E−|2),

(2)

where ℓ0 is the linear loss and γ is the self-amplitude
modulation coeﬃcient characterizing the nonlinear (sat-
urable) part of the loss. Such a saturable absorbtion
mechanism can come from Kerr-lensing [8, 23], caused
by a nonlinear refractive index n2 in the active region.
As the intensity increases, the mode is more conﬁned in
the plane transverse to the propagation direction, and the
net gain it experiences is greater. The reason is twofold:
First, the mode overlaps more with the active region,
leading to a larger modal gain (this mechanism is often
called “soft Kerr-lensing” [27]). Second, the overlap with
the metal contacts is smaller, leading to smaller losses
[23].

E+ and E− satisfy the boundary conditions E+ = rE−
at the z = 0 boundary and rE+ = E− at the z = L
boundary (L is the cavity length and r ≈ 0.53 is the re-
ﬂection coeﬃcient). The other quantities in Eq. (1) are
constants: k, N , and Γ are the wavenumber (in the ma-
terial) associated with the resonance optical frequency,
the electron density in the active region, and the over-
lap factor between the laser mode and the active region
respectively.

ing numerically the equations Eq. (1) with the follow-

W [23]. The index change
due to this n2 at typical intracavity intensities is about
10−3. The other parameters are ℓ0 = 5 cm−1, T1 = 0.5
ps [19], T2 = 0.07 ps (corresponding to a gain FWHM

bandwidth of 4.8 THz), L = 0.3 cm, and n = 3, which
are typical values for these lasers. N and Γ are not needed
as long as the pumping is expressed relative to the las-
ing threshold. Note that the simulated spectra presented
in Fig. 2 are averaged over about a microsecond. Only
then does the average spectrum reach a steady state and
a clear pattern shows up. The averaging is motivated
by the fact that experimentally the spectra are acquired
over an even much longer timescale. The envelopes of
the spectra show two clear peaks whose separation com-
pares well with twice the Rabi frequency, similarly to the
experiment.

FIG. 3: Optical spectra vs. pumping ratio above threshold
obtained in cw at 300K with a 5 µm wide buried heterostruc-
ture lasers emitting at 5 µm.

The lowering of the RNGH instability threshold by
a saturable absorber can be established analytically by
means of linear stability analysis. We propose this mech-
anism as the main reason for the observation of the
RNGH instability at much lower pumping than RNGH
In order to support this idea, we

now present spectra from another device similar to the
one described previously. The only diﬀerence between
the two lasers is a shorter optical wavelength (5µm)
(wafer #3252) and a wider active region (5µm). The
two-dimensional waveguide simulations indicate a much
weaker Kerr-lensing eﬀect in these QCLs (γ is smaller by
a factor of 4), due to the much larger ratio of active re-
gion width to wavelength. The measured optical spectra
obtained at 300K in cw mode with the 5µm device are
shown in Fig. 3. The data clearly show that the laser is
at ﬁrst single mode close to threshold and becomes multi-
mode immediately after a slight increase of the pumping
current. The envelopes of the spectra consist of multiple
peaks, with an average separation 0.2THz, independently
of the pumping. Numerical integration of Eq. (1) with-
out a saturable absorber (γ = 0) leads to spectra that

4

qualitatively agree with the ones in Fig. 3.

Ref. [15] suggested that the suppression of the central
peak in RNGH-type spectra can be due to the complex
level structure of the gain medium, a dye molecule in that
case. We show that SHB can also result in the suppres-
sion of the central peak (Fig. 2).

Our postulation of saturable absorption due to Kerr-
lensing is supported by more extensive study of diﬀerent
devices beyond those shown in this Letter. First, we ob-
served that for the same emission wavelength, a broad ac-
tive region leads to a less pronounced RNGH-type signa-
ture. Second, we have also tested several standard ridge
waveguide QCLs, for which the sidewalls of the ridges are
covered by the gold contact. For these devices the cou-
pling between the optical mode and the metal is expected
to be stronger and so is the eﬀect of saturable absorber
due to Kerr-lensing. The spectral behavior observed in
this class of devices is dominated by RNGH-type insta-
bility.

In summary, a coherent multimode instability in quan-
tum cascade lasers (QCLs) has been observed.
It is
similar in many ways to the Risken-Nummedal-Graham-
Haken (RNGH) instability. The threshold of the ob-
served phenomenon is signiﬁcantly lower than in the orig-
inal RNGH instability, which is attributed to the pres-
ence of a saturable absorber in the laser. For devices
with a weaker saturable absorber, the envelope of the
optical spectrum consists of many maxima whose sepa-
rations are independent of the intracavity power. The
nontrivial shape of the spectrum can be explained by
SHB.

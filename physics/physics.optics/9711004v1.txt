Abstract: A phase space description of the fractional Talbot eﬀect,
occurring in a one–dimensional Fresnel diﬀraction from a periodic grat-
ing, is presented. Using the phase space formalism a compact summa-
tion formula for the Wigner function at rational multiples of the Talbot
distance is derived. The summation formula shows that the fractional
Talbot image in the phase space is generated by a ﬁnite sum of spatially
displaced Wigner functions of the source ﬁeld.

It is the purpose of this communication to investigate a one dimensional Fresnel diﬀrac-
tion from a periodic grating and the corresponding fractional Talbot eﬀect [1] using the
Wigner phase space distribution function.

We use the following deﬁnition of the Wigner distribution function [2] for the

ﬁeld amplitude E(x) along the axis x perpendicular to the propagation direction:

W (x, u) =

dy E∗(x + y/2)eiuyE(x − y/2),

2π Z

where u has the meaning of a spatial frequency. We consider a monochromatic plane
wave characterized by its electric ﬁeld E(x; z) = eikzE(x; z) propagated paraxially along
the z-axis. At z = 0, where the ﬁeld starts to propagate, there is an inﬁnite one–
dimensional periodic grating with transmittance t(x) = t(x + a). The electric ﬁeld
amplitude after the passage through the grating can be expanded into the Fourier series:

E(x; 0) = t(x)E0 =

tne2πinx/a,

Xn=−∞

where a is the period of the grating and E0 is a constant amplitude of the incident wave.
The Wigner distribution function of this source ﬁeld is given by:

W (x, u; 0) =

Two diﬀerent types of contributions can be distinguished in the above formula. The
ﬁrst one is a set of parallel positive density stripes separated by the spatial frequency
u0 = 2π/a, given by the reciprocal grid spacing. Each of them is generated by a sepa-
rate Fourier component of the source ﬁeld. Coherence between the Fourier components
results in nonpositive oscillatory terms of the Wigner function, located precisely in the
middle between the contributing frequencies. The nonpositive interference terms are
a consequence of the linear superposition principle and the bilinear character of the
Wigner function.

The paraxial propagation of the ﬁeld through a distance z is described in the
phase space as the following simple transformation of the Wigner distribution function
[2]:

W (x, u; z) = W (x −

u, u; 0).

This formula applied to the Wigner function of the periodic ﬁeld gives the following

In the course of propagation the interference terms acquire additional phase shifts given
by

z
zT
where zT = a2/2λ is the Talbot distance. It is straightforward to see that for inte-
ger multiples of the Talbot distance the original Wigner function of the input ﬁeld is
reproduced.

At intermediate distances, the phase shifts θn play a nontrivial role and the
structure of the observed Fresnel images becomes more complex. Nevertheless, they
exhibit an interesting regular behavior at rational multiples of the Talbot distance. We
will now discuss this eﬀect in terms of the Wigner distribution function. Let us denote
z/zT = p/q, where p and q are coprime integers. The main complication in Eq. (5) are
phase factors θn which depend quadratically on n. We will simplify it with the help of
an observation used in the studies of quantum wave packets dynamics [3]: the exponent
exp(−2πiθn) is periodic in n with the period l = q/4 if q is a multiple of 4 and l = q
otherwise. The quadratic phase factor can therefore be represented as a ﬁnite Fourier
sum:

exp(−2πiθn) =

as exp(−2πisn/l)

with certain coeﬃcients as, which have been analyzed in detail in Ref. [3]. Substitution

The interference terms of the Wigner function can now be interpreted as generated
by pairs of Fourier components of the source ﬁeld shifted in the position space by
rational fractions sa/l, where s = 0, 1, . . . , l−1. A simple rearrangement of the exponent
arguments allows one to represent the sum over n and n′ solely in terms of the source
ﬁeld Wigner function:

This is a compact summation formula for the Wigner function at rational multiples of
the Talbot distance. It shows, quite surprisingly, that W (x, u; pzT /q) is simply given by
a ﬁnite sum of spatially displaced Wigner functions of the source ﬁeld, with some phase
factors.

Integration of the derived expression for the Wigner function over u yields the

known formula for the ﬁeld intensity distribution in the observation plane:

images can be found in Ref. [5].

We have discussed a one dimensional Fresnel diﬀraction from a periodic grating
using the phase space formalism. We have seen in this picture, that the whole propaga-
tion of the ﬁeld is encoded in the interference terms of the Wigner function, generated
by coherence between Fourier components of the source wave. The variety of the Fresnel
images is simply a result of a complicated interplay between phases of these interference

terms. The summation formula derived in this paper demonstrates that the fractional
Talbot eﬀect can be also understood as an interference between components shifted in
the position space by fractions of the pattern period.

Let us ﬁnally note a close analogy between the Talbot eﬀect and the dynam-
ics of various nonlinear quantum systems. Dynamical phase factors with a quadratic
dependence on the summation index are a common feature of many problems. These
phase factors can be easily revealed in the equation of motion for the quantum Wigner
function in the (x, p) phase space:

Wψ(x, p; t) =

ψ∗

nψn′ exp[i(En − En′ )t/¯h]Wnn′ (x, p; 0),

(11)

where ψn are the amplitudes of the initial wave function ψ(x; 0) projected onto the
energy eigenstate ϕn(x), and where

Wnn′ (x, p) =

dy ϕ∗

n(x + y/2)eipy/¯hϕn′ (x − y/2)

(12)

are the cross Wigner functions of the eigenstates. For many systems, their eigenergies En
are given by a quadratic polynomial of n. This can be either an approximate dependence,
as it is for the Rydberg electron wave packets [6], or a strict one, as it happens for an
electromagnetic ﬁeld mode in the Kerr medium [7] and a particle in the inﬁnite square
well. In all these cases, the state of the system turns out to be highly regular for times
equal to rational multiples of the characteristic revival time, at which the system is
again in its initial state. This regularity consists in a formation of a ﬁnite superposition
of copies of the initial state generated by a simple transformation. For the wave packets
dynamics, the components are spatially shifted [3]; for the Kerr medium, the components
are rotated in the phase space around its origin [8].

In particular, a close similarity exists between the Talbot eﬀect and the frac-
tional revivals in the inﬁnite square well. The dynamics of the latter system is equivalent
to an evolution in a free space of an inﬁnite periodic sequence of displaced initial wave
functions [9,10]. Furthermore, the propagation of electromagnetic ﬁelds in the paraxial
approximation is governed by the same wave equation as the quantum time evolution.
Therefore, Fresnel diﬀraction of classical electromagnetic waves on periodic gratings is
a strict counterpart of the quantum dynamics of a conﬁned particle.

Abstract

Surface waves on liquids act as a dynamical phase grating for incident light. In this article, we

revisit the classical method of probing such waves (wavelengths of the order of mm) as well as

inherent properties of liquids and liquid ﬁlms on liquids, using optical diﬀraction. A combination

of simulation and experiment is proposed to trace out the surface wave proﬁles in various situations

(eg.

for one or more vertical, slightly immersed, electrically driven exciters). Subsequently, the

surface tension and the spatial damping coeﬃcient (related to viscosity) of a variety of liquids are

measured carefully in order to gauge the eﬃciency of measuring liquid properties using this optical

probe. The ﬁnal set of results deal with liquid ﬁlms where dispersion relations, surface and interface

modes, interfacial tension and related issues are investigated in some detail, both theoretically and

experimentally. On the whole, our observations and analyses seem to support the claim that this

simple, low–cost apparatus is capable of providing a wealth of information on liquids and liquid

surface waves in a non–destructive way.

INTRODUCTION

Optical probes are usually non–destructive – they do not change the properties of the

medium being probed in any signiﬁcant way (unless the probe power is large). Diﬀraction

and scattering of light, as is known over centuries, are therefore capable of providing a variety

of information.

In this article, we revisit a well-known classical method of investigating

liquid surface waves using light diﬀraction. Although this method is well–studied in the

context of measurements of surface tension of liquids [1], our motivation for revisiting it is

primarily aimed at demonstrating its utility and capability in understanding a wider class

of situations/phenomena. In particular, we investigate two aspects – surface wave proﬁles

and liquid properties for waves on a single liquid and also for waves on liquid ﬁlms.

Before we begin with details, it is worth summarizing some of the earlier work on liquid

as well as solid surface waves. Use of laser light scattering is a unique technique for non-

contact, noninvasive study of Surface Acoustic Waves (henceforth referred to as SAW) [2].

Technological advances directed towards diverse applications of SAW on solid surfaces are

now well established, and has resulted in important developments in the fabrication of

practical devices [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

However, relatively few articles deal with surface acoustic waves on liquid surfaces

[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. To mention a few, high frequency capillary waves at

the surface of liquid gallium and the mercury liquid-vapor interface have been studied by

means of quasielastic light-scattering spectroscopy [21]. The spatial damping coeﬃcient of

low-frequency surface waves at air-water interfaces, using a novel heterodyne light–scattering

technique, has been measured and reported in [22]. Quasi-elastic light scattering has been

used to study thermally excited capillary waves on free liquid surfaces over a considerably

wider range of surface wavenumbers [13, 16]. Measurements of the decay coeﬃcient of capil-

lary waves in liquids covered with monolayers of stearic acid, oleyl alcohol, and hemicyanine

are reported in [23].

In a recent article, we have shown how the eﬀect of interfering waves on a liquid surface

could be inferred from the nature of the diﬀraction pattern [15]. Here we begin by proposing

a combined method of simulation and experiment, suﬃciently general in nature and capable

of verifying the nature of the actual liquid surface wave proﬁle. Having known the proﬁle,

we then focus on the dispersion relation and discuss experiments to determine the surface

2

tension and viscosity of liquids. Finally, we turn to liquid ﬁlms where we try to understand

the proﬁle through the various modes (surface and interface) and then go on to check the

values of interfacial tension.

Section II describes the basic scheme of our experimental arrangement. The methodology

of our experiment and typical results pertaining to the surface wave proﬁle are discussed

in section III. In section IV, we discuss theory, observations and measurements of surface

tension and viscosity for diﬀerent liquids. Section V ﬁrst discusses the theoretical platform

for SAW on liquid ﬁlms. We then verify our theory with experiments. Finally, in section

VI, we summarize our results with some concluding remarks.

A: Laser, B: Frequency generator, C: Screen, D: Loudspeaker, E: Spectrometer and prism table

assembly and F: Exciter.

As shown in Fig. 1, a petridish of diameter about 18.5 cm is ﬁlled with the experimental

liquid to a depth of

1 cm. A metal pin with its blunt end glued vertically upright to the

∼

diaphragm of a loud speaker (held above the petridish) acts as an exciter. When slightly

immersed in the liquid and driven by a low frequency sinusoidal signal generator, this exciter

vibrates vertically up and down and generates the desired liquid surface waves. To study

the proﬁle of surface waves we place the petridish-loud-speaker assembly on the prism-table

of a spectrometer in order to choose the diﬀracting element at any position on the liquid

surface and to record the corresponding position from the prism-table scale (with a least

3

count of 1 minute). Light from a 5 mW He-Ne laser (λ = 632.8 nm) having a beam diameter
1.8 mm is directed to fall on the liquid surface at an angle of incidence of 770, as noted

of

∼

in our experiment. The laser beam incident on the dynamical phase grating formed on

the liquid surface, produces a Fraunhofer diﬀraction pattern which is observed on a screen

placed at a fairly large distance (3.42 meters in our case) from the diﬀraction center. The

images of the diﬀraction pattern are recorded using a digital camera (make Sony, DSC -

P93, 5.1 mega pixels). Spurious noise in the image is removed using Photoshop software.

The intensity across the diﬀraction spots are measured using a photo-detector operating

in the linear dynamic range of the photo-currents’ response to optical power. During our
experiment, the room temperature recorded is 250C.

III. THE SURFACE WAVE PROFILE

Low frequency surface waves are not visible to the naked eye. One may appreciate this

when we simulate the surface wave proﬁle using realistic dimensions and parameters.

In

4

a previous study [15], we measured the surface-wave parameters (wavelength, amplitude

at the point of excitation) at a given oscillation frequency (220 Hz). Here, we use similar

typical values to generate theoretically the distribution of waves on the liquid surface. The

equations, which we use to simulate the wave proﬁle for the cases of single and double-pin

exciters are (at a ﬁxed time ‘t’, say t=0)

respectively. Here (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the centers of oscillations and δ is the spatial

damping coeﬃcient of the liquid. To mimic the intended experiments, we assume that each

wave has the same frequency ω, wavelength Λ, and amplitude h (at the center of oscillation).

In our simulations, we use Λ = 2.1 mm, h =1.0 mm and D = 8 mm (separation between
pin-exciters) [15]. δ is chosen to be 0.235 cm−1 (for water at 220 Hz, we obtain this value

from experiments discussed later in section IV). The corresponding surface-wave proﬁles

estimated for the two cases of interest are shown in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b), respectively.

Following this recipe one can obtain the surface-wave proﬁle for any number of oscillation

sources. The simulated proﬁles enable a better visualization, which, in turn, can act as a

guideline for their actual experimental veriﬁcation.

B. Experimental results for two source pattern

The simulated proﬁles are built on the assumptions made in Eqn. 1 and Eqn. 2. It is

necessary to verify experimentally whether the assumptions are good enough to represent

the characteristics of the surface waves. We note that the simulated two source interference

pattern [shown in Fig. 2(b)] exhibits hyperbolic loci for the constructive and destructive

interference nodes. Using this fact as a guideline, we trace the hyperbolic loci (maxima

and minima of the interfering waves) on the liquid surface by observing the changes in

the corresponding diﬀraction patterns. Initially, when the laser beam is incident along the

pattern. O1 and O2 are the two exciters. Solid lines are the hyperbolic loci along the direction of

central line PQ (see Fig. 3) where constructive interference of waves occur, the diﬀracted

light shows, as expected [15], a central spot along with higher order ones symmetrically

located on either side of the central spot [see Fig. 4(a)]. As we shift the probe beam

gradually away from the central line along a circle (note the arrow in Fig. 3), the number of

higher order spots progressively decreases till we reach the position of the adjacent hyperbola

(O2A), where the diﬀraction should ideally contain only the central order. In experiment,

however, at this position, we ﬁnd the ﬁrst order spots too, though with very low intensity

[see Fig. 4(b)]. This happens due to the ﬁnite spot size of the laser beam. Nevertheless,

beginning with the central line at one side and gradually rotating the prism-table till we reach
1800, we observe a repetition of the patterns [shown in Fig. 4(a) and 4(b)] symmetrically

at all complementary angles. We note the angular positions of all consecutive minima.

These results are shown in Table-I. Thus, a comparison of our experiment (Fig. 3) with the

simulation [upper half of Fig. 2(b)] for identical values of parameters shows the same number
(eight) of destructive interference lines at almost the same angular separation. Beyond 1800
and upto 3600, (i.e, while scanning the lower semicircular region in Fig. 3) identical patterns

are observed. This conﬁrms that the Eqn. 2 used to describe and simulate the two source

6

ence and (b) destructive interference for the two source (exciter) case.

surface wave proﬁle is, indeed, a correct representation of the observed proﬁle. We note

that our method of investigation is suﬃciently general (we have indeed checked with three

exciters) and can be used for several exciters located along a line or in other geometric

conﬁgurations (eg. exciters on a triangle, quadrilateral etc.).

IV. THE DISPERSION RELATION AND LIQUID PROPERTIES USING LIGHT

DIFFRACTION

Knowing the surface wave proﬁle is, of course, not enough. A crucial element of any wave

phenomenon is the dispersion relation, which, obviously, contains within it, quantiﬁers of

material properties (here, liquid properties, such as surface tension and viscosity). In this

section we describe how we use Fraunhofer diﬀraction of laser light by the surface proﬁle of

ripples on liquids, described in Section III, to study such liquid properties. Several methods

to accurately determine these two properties are now well-established and available in the

7

literature. For measurement of surface tension, techniques widely used are the Capillary Rise

method, Drop-weight method, Jaeger’s method, Rayleigh’s method etc. [24, 25]. Likewise,

for the measurement of viscosity, popular methods like Poiseuille’s method, Stokes’ method

etc., are well-known and gives accurate results [24, 25]. Here, we focus on a single optical

set up which can measure both surface tension and viscosity of low-viscous liquids with

reasonable accuracy. Though the measurement of surface tension of liquids using Fraunhofer

diﬀraction of laser light by surface waves is well known in the literature [1], to the best of

our knowledge the estimation of the viscosity of a liquid using this probe and, in particular,

the simple method which we have followed, is certainly new. In the following we elaborate

on the above mentioned measurements in some detail.

A. Surface tension

Consider the well-known dispersion relation for SAW on liquids [26, 27, 28]

ω2 =

gK + αK 3/ρ
(cid:17)
(cid:16)

.

(3)

Here ω and K are the angular frequency and wavevector of the SAW, respectively. α and

ρ are the surface tension and density of the liquid and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

The above relation shows that waves at the surface of the liquid are dominated by gravity

as well as surface tension. Neglecting the gravitational eﬀect and taking the logarithm on

both sides of the Eqn. (3) we get

In our experiments, we have generated the SAW on the liquid surface with a single exciter.

The expected surface wave proﬁle [shown in Fig 2(a)] acts as a reﬂection phase grating for

the incident laser light. The intensity distribution of the Fraunhofer diﬀraction pattern in

this case can be expressed as [11, 14, 15, 29]

Bessel function in Eqn. 5 gives the magnitude of intensity of diﬀraction spots for diﬀerent

orders n, while the positions of the spots are given by the delta function. If we take the

separation between the central order and the ﬁrst order (n=1) diﬀraction spots to be d, from

the above delta function in Eqn. 5 we get the expression for the wavenumber K as

we can approximate K as

θi is the grazing angle of incidence of the laser beam. For small grazing angle,

where l is the perpendicular height of the central order spot from the liquid surface level

(see Fig. 5). As ω changes, the distance between bright spots of the diﬀraction pattern also

changes. Sets of diﬀraction patterns are obtained on the screen for diﬀerent values of ω. For

each set we have traced the positions of spots of diﬀerent order on the screen.

For Fraunhofer diﬀraction, values of z and l in Eqn. 7 are quite large (342 cm and 87 cm,

respectively, in our experiment). Thus, the systematic error introduced in measuring these

lengths with a metre scale (with a least count of 1.0 mm) is quite less. On the other hand, a

careful and accurate measurement of d (of the order of few mm) is crucial for evaluating K.

From the characteristic feature of the delta function in Eqn. 5 we ﬁnd that the diﬀraction

spots due to diﬀerent orders are equidistant for a particular SAW frequency. Thus, to reduce

the systematic error in measuring d, we have measured the separation between the positive

and the negative fourth-order (ﬁfth-order) spots. The values of d are obtained through

averaging these data. For each frequency ω, we have repeated the experiment at least four

times. Hence, using Eqn. 7, we estimate the value of K for a particular ω. In addition, it is

reasonable to assume that the frequency, ω, of SAW is the same as that of the exciter (driven

by a function generator) [15]. Thus, the values of ω are found directly from the frequency

readings of the function generator driving the exciter. Following these measurements, we

plot a ln -ln graph for K vs. ω and evaluate the slope and y-intercept of this curve. The
slope of the curve ( 3

2) should verify the power law predicted by the dispersion relation while

the y-intercept should give the surface tension.

Our experimental results on three diﬀerent liquids (water, 1-hexanol and kerosene – a

mixture of petrolium hydrocarbons) are shown in Fig. 6. The non-linear least square ﬁt

(shown by lines in Fig. 6) to the data with Eqn. 4 veriﬁes the 1.5 exponent of the dispersion

relation within experimental uncertainty (1.5

0.03). Using the known value of ρ for each

±
liquid, we estimate the value of α from the measured y-intercept of the straight lines. It is

to be noted that the maximum percentage error in measuring α is limited to 6% - 8% (for

10

diﬀerent liquids) by our measurement procedure. We have tabulated the measured values

of surface tension for diﬀerent liquids in Table-II. These results match quite well with the

standard values of surface tension for the corresponding liquids [30].

FIG. 8: Experimental plot of distance (x) versus surface acoustic wave amplitude (h). Solid line,

dashed line, and dotted line for the liquids water, kerosene, and 1-hexanol respectively.

Using the same experimental set-up we now move on towards estimating the viscosity of

a given liquid. When we generate SAW by means of a single pin exciter, the amplitude of

the wave at the point of oscillation is almost the same as the amplitude of the oscillating

pin in a low viscous liquid [15]. However, if we imagine a radial straight line from the

source of excitation (on the liquid surface), then along this line the amplitude of SAW is

gradually damped (Fig. 5) due to the viscosity of the liquid. We have seen in the previous

section that the intensities of diﬀerent orders depend only on the amplitude of the surface

acoustic wave, if other parameters like θi and λ are kept constant (Eqn. 5). Theoretical

plots of wave amplitude versus the intensity ratios, I0/I1, I1/I0 and I0/I2, using Eqn. 5

(keeping θi and λ ﬁxed) are shown in Fig 7. In our experiment, for a particular ω, the above

intensity ratios in the diﬀraction pattern are measured by a photo-diode detector when the

laser beam is focused along a radial line at diﬀerent distances on the liquid surface from

the point of excitation (x in Fig. 5). The intensity ratios like I0/I1 and I0/I2 for each x

are then estimated. By comparing our experimentally measured ratios with those obtained

from the theoretical plots (Fig. 7), we estimate the average value of h at that location

on the liquid surface.

It is to be noted that, for I0 << I1, the value of this ratio I0/I1

becomes very small and could yield erroneous results. In such cases, we used the ratio I1/I0

for estimation of h (however, we were always below the limit for which this ratio becomes

very large). In Fig. 8 we plot x, the distance from the point of oscillation vs. h, the SAW

amplitude for three experimental liquids (water, kerosene, and 1-hexanol). We ﬁt the data

points with an exponential decay function, where we kept the decay constant (also known

as spatial damping coeﬃcient of the liquid), δ, as varying parameter. The values of δ for

three diﬀerent liquids are tabulated in Table-II.

The wavevector for a wave of ﬁxed real frequency, ω, has a small imaginary part, which

contributes to the spatial damping. Substituting K = K0 + iδ (where δ << K0) in the well-

known Navier-Stokes equation for waves on a liquid-air interface one gets[22, 31],

where η is the viscosity of the liquid. Experimentally, we have obtained the values of α and

δ for the above mentioned liquids. The estimated value of viscosity of diﬀerent liquids, using

Eqn. 8, are shown in Table-II. The experimental plots in Fig 8 are for frequency 220 Hz.

We have also checked our results for two other frequencies (260 Hz and 300 Hz) and have

V. LIQUID FILMS ON LIQUIDS: THEORY AND EXPERIMENTS

Till now we have been exclusively concerned with waves on the surface of a single liquid,

or, more precisely, waves at the liquid-air interface. A more complicated scenario arises

when there exists a ﬁlm of a diﬀerent liquid on top of a given liquid (the two liquids are

immiscible). In such a situation, the dispersion relation changes drastically, which, in turn,

changes the surface wave proﬁle. We now investigate the novelties that arise through studies

with our optical probe.

A. Background theoretical framework

The dispersion relation in Eqn. 3 for SAW propagation on liquid surfaces is valid only

when the depth of experimental liquid is large. For lower values of the depth of the liquid

(denoted by, say y), the relation becomes [27]

ω2 =

αK 3
ρ

tanh (Ky)

(9)

where, here too, we neglect a term due to gravity. Typically, if we choose y = 1 cm and a
range of K from 20 to 80 cm −1 (as used in our earlier experiment), tanh (Ky) is nearly unity,

and the dispersion relation reduces to the one given by Eqn. 3. The interesting problem we

focus on now is that of wave propagation on a liquid ﬁlm spread out on another liquid. If the

thickness of the ﬁlm is very low, then not only the surface tension but also the interfacial

tension across the liquid-ﬁlm boundary, play a role in the propagation mechanism of the

waves. We ﬁrst work out a general dispersion relation where the surface and interfacial

tensions as well as the ﬁlm thickness appear explicitly in our mathematical expressions.

Fig. 9 shows the symbols used to represent various parameters in the following discussion.

We denote the density of the lower liquid by ρ while α is the interfacial tension at the liquid-

liquid interface. The same quantities for the ﬁlm-air interface are represented with primes

′

′

i.e., ρ

and α

respectively. The equilibrium plane of separation (interface) between the

liquids is at y = 0. The liquid below the y = 0 plane extends upto a value y =
H with
H being very large. The ﬁlm is located above y = 0 with a thickness y′ << H. Under

the probe laser beam oﬀ the surface wave proﬁle on the liquid ﬁlm, we can obtain information

B. Experiments and results

In our experiments, we have studied the diﬀerent modes (discussed in previous section)

that arise due to the presence of ﬁlms of kerosene, n,n-dimethyl aniline, o-xylene spread on

the surface of water. The choice of these liquids is due to the fact that these are immiscible

with water, have density lower w.r.t. water, are low-viscous and have a higher boiling point.
63 cm2 is ﬁlled with water to a depth

In these experiments with ﬁlms, a petridish of area

∼

of nearly 1 cm and the liquid ﬁlm is formed by adding a measured quantity of the second

liquid in drops from a micropipette. The thickness of the ﬁlm is estimated from the known

volume of the liquid and the surface area of the petridish. Uniformity of the ﬁlms on the

water surface has been checked optically. In order to avoid any decrease in thickness due to

evaporation, we have taken observations within 5 minutes of the formation of the uniformly

spread ﬁlm. The measurements are of the same type as those mentioned while studying

surface tension (discussed in the earlier section) except that, in the present case, we do the

experiments for varying ﬁlm thicknesses. Here, we show our experimental results only for

o-xylene ﬁlms of diﬀerent thicknesses on water. For ﬁlms of the other liquids mentioned

above, on water, we have observed similar behavior.

To study diﬀerent modes of the surface waves due to a liquid-ﬁlm of o-xylene on water,

we ﬁrst plot the experimental ω

K behavior with ﬁlm thickness as a parameter. The

∼

theoretically obtained ω-K curves for diﬀerent modes : ω+, ω−, and ωs (as a limiting case of

ω+ mode) - are then placed on the same graph for comparison. Here we use standard values

17

: α = 37.2 dyne/cm α′ = 29.8 dyne/cm, ρ′= 0.88 gm/cc, and ρ=1 gm/cc in Eqn. 18 [30]. It

is evident that for a ﬁlm of thickness as low as 0.016 cm, the measured data corresponds to

ω+ mode [Fig. 11(a)], while for ﬁlms of thickness typically 0.158 cm, the experimental data

matches well with the ωs mode [Fig. 11(b)]. However, any intermediate thickness between

0.016 and 0.158 cm yields data within the ω+ and ωs modes [Fig. 11(c)]. This clearly shows

that the ω+ mode always dominates over ω− mode, as was expected from Fig. 10. For

thicker ﬁlms the ω+ mode coincides with ωs mode, whereas for thinner ﬁlms the mode is

still ω+, though it is modiﬁed by the presence of the interfacial tension and the density of

the lower liquid and is not equal to ωs. The critical thickness of a ﬁlm below which the ω−

mode can become dominant is 0.0038 cm, which is less than 0.016 cm.

FIG. 12: Nonlinear curve ﬁtting of the experimental data for water- o-xylene ﬁlm of thicknesses

The above conclusions have been further veriﬁed by analyzing the experimental data for

the estimation of the surface and interfacial tension. We have ﬁtted our experimental data

of water-o-xylene ﬁlm of thickness 0.016 cm with ω+ and ω− modes in Eqn. 18 by nonlinear

curve ﬁtting (keeping surface tension and interfacial tension as varying parameters). The
+ mode ﬁts with the experimental data and estimates the values of surface tension (α′)

dyne/cm [solid line in Fig. 12]. These values are very close to the standard values available

in the literature [32]. On the other hand, ω− mode fails to ﬁt the experimental data well

(dashed line in Fig. 12); moreover, it yields unphysical values of surface and interfacial

tension.

Experimental limitations, in our present set up, did not allow us to make ﬁlms of thickness

low enough (see the inset in Fig. 10) to check the ω− mode in our experiment. We hope to

do better experiments in future to probe this mode in detail.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this article, we describe a simple optics-based experimental technique devised with the

necessary background theoretical formulation to study the characteristics of surface acoustic

waves on liquids. Firstly, we visualize the proﬁle of the surface waves using simulations with

realistic values for the parameters involved. The locations of the nodes and antinodes which

appear in the simulated proﬁle are used to match the proﬁle with actual experiments. We

also claim that this combined method of simulation and experimentation can be used for

other geometric conﬁgurations of oscillating sources on liquid surfaces. Subsequently, the

two key liquid properties, surface tension and viscosity, which appear in the dispersion rela-

tion and play an integral role in the propagation of such capillary waves on a liquid surface,

are measured optically using Fraunhofer diﬀraction of laser light. We note, in particular,

the novelty and simplicity in the measurement of viscosity and the fact that our measure-

ment tools, are non-destructive but by no means, less precise. Results of our experiments

with several liquids, when compared to the respective values known from other sources and

literature, summarily establish the eﬃcacy and accuracy of our approach. We anticipate, in

future, the introduction of technological sophistications in our set-up, which might lead to

an ‘Optical Surfacetensometer cum Viscometer’. The advantage of having a single set-up

for measuring both these properties need not be further emphasised. Finally, we investigate,

both experimentally and theoretically, an interesting aspect of SAW characteristics involved

with a liquid ﬁlm placed on the surface of an immissible liquid. The dispersion relation we

frame to study this case not only explains the features of the surface and interfacial modes,

but also provides an estimate of the interfacial tension across the ﬁlm-liquid boundary. In

19

summary, our experimental and theoretical results seem to demonstrate the capability of

our set-up in carrying out studies pertaining to SAW proﬁle, liquid properties and waves

on liquid ﬁlms on liquids. Despite its limitations, the wide variety of information which

can be obtained from such a simple set-up, makes it a tool worth improving upon in future

investigations.

OPTICAL MICROSPHERE RESONATORS: OPTIMAL COUPLING TO HIGH-Q
WHISPERING-GALLERY MODES

M.L.Gorodetsky and V.S.Ilchenko
Moscow State University, 119899, Moscow, Russia

A general model is presented for coupling of high-Q whispering-gallery modes in optical micro-
sphere resonators with coupler devices possessing discrete and continuous spectrum of propagating
modes. By contrast to conventional high-Q optical cavities, in microspheres independence of high
intrinsic quality-factor and controllable parameters of coupling via evanescent ﬁeld oﬀer variety of
regimes earlier available in RF devices. The theory is applied to the earlier-reported data on diﬀer-
ent types of couplers to microsphere resonators and complemented by experimental demonstration
of enhanced coupling eﬃciency (about 80%) and variable loading regimes with Q > 108 fused silica
microspheres.

I. INTRODUCTION

High-Q optical microsphere resonators currently attract growing interest in experimental cavity QED [1–3], measure-
ment science, [4,5] frequency stabilization and other photonics applications [6,7]. Stemming from extensive studies of
Mie resonances in microdroplets of aerosols [8](observed via elastic and inelastic scattering of free-space beams), further
studies of laboratory-fabricated solid-state microspheres focus on the properties and applications of highly-conﬁned
whispering-gallery (WG) modes. The modes of this type possess negligible electrodynamically-deﬁned radiative losses
(the corresponding radiative quality factors Qrad > 1020 and higher), and are not accessible by free-space beams
and therefore require employment of near-ﬁeld coupler devices. By present moment, in addition to the well known
prism coupler with frustrated total internal reﬂection [9,10], demonstrated coupler devices include sidepolished ﬁber
coupler [5,11,12] and ﬁber taper [13]. The principle of all these devices is based on providing eﬃcient energy transfer
to the resonant circular total-internal-reﬂection-guided wave in the resonator (representing WG mode) through the
evanescent ﬁeld of a guided wave or a TIR spot in the coupler.

It is evident a priori that eﬃcient coupling maybe expected upon fulﬁllment of two main conditions: 1)phase
synchronism and 2)signiﬁcant overlap of the two waves modelling the WG mode and coupler mode respectively.
Although reasonable coupling eﬃciency has been demonstrated with three types of devices (up to few tens of percents
of input beam energy absorbed in a mode upon resonance), no systematic theoretical approach has been developed
to quantify the performance of coupler devices. It still remained unclear whether it is possible at all and what are
conditions to provide complete exchange of energy between a propagating mode in a coupler device and the given
whispering gallery mode in high-Q microsphere. Answers to these questions are of critical importance for photonics
applications and also for the proposed cavity QED experiments with microspheres.

In this paper, we present a general approach to describe the near-ﬁeld coupling of high-Q whispering-gallery mode to
a propagating mode in dielectric prism, slab or waveguide structure. Theoretical results present a complete description
and give a recipe to obtain optimal coupling with existing devices. We emphasize the importance of the introduced
loading quality-factor parameter Qc and its relation with the intrinsic Q0-factor of WG modes as crucial condition to
obtain optimal coupling. Theoretical consideration is complemented by experimental tests of variable loading regimes
and demonstration of improved coupling eﬃciency with prism coupler.

II. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

Let us examine excitation of a single high-Q whispering gallery mode with high quality-factor by (N ) travelling
modes in an evanescent wave coupler. This coupler can either have inﬁnite number of spatial modes (N =
, as in
prism coupler [9,10] and slab) or only one mode (N = 1, as in tapered ﬁber [13] and integrated channel waveguide).
We shall start with simple description of the system using lumped parameters and quasigeometrical approximation.
Let A0(t) be the amplitude of a circulating mode of total internal reﬂection in the resonator (see Fig.1) to model
the whispering-gallery mode. Let the pump power be distributed in the coupler between its modes so that Bk(t) is
2 equal to
Bin(t)
N ) and Bin(t) is the slow varying amplitude with
the amplitude of mode k (1

total pump power. Let us assume for simplicity that coupling between diﬀerent modes is absent without the resonator.

Assuming that the coupling zone is much smaller than the diameter D of the resonator, we can introduce local
real amplitude coeﬃcients of transmittance Tk to describe the coupling of the resonator with all modes of the coupler
(either guided or leakage ones) and the internal reﬂectivity coeﬃcient R. We shall denote arrays of transmittance
coeﬃcients and amplitudes as vectors T and B respectively. If the quality-factor of the resonator mode is high enough,
then a single circle gives only small contribution to the mode buildup and therefore 1

In the above representation the microsphere is equivalent to a ring resonator formed by mirrors with transmittances
Tk and ﬁlled with lossy medium, or, in case of single-mode coupling, as pointed in [11], to a Fabry-Perot resonator of
the length L/2 with totally reﬂecting rear mirror.

If propagation losses are small, then near the resonance frequency ω0 = 2πc/λ0, nsL = mλ0, where m is integer,

1 describes mode matching and shows how close the ﬁeld in the couplers matches the near ﬁeld

The term δ0 originates from intrinsic quality factor Q0 = 2πns/αλ while δc describes loading i.e. mode energy
escape to all modes of the coupler. Hereafter we shall mark all values associated with coupler by index ‘c’ and values
associated with microsphere by index ‘s’.

Equation (3) is a classical equation for the amplitude of the resonator pumped by harmonical ﬁeld.
As will be shown below, coeﬃcients Tk can be calculated as normalized overlap integrals of the ﬁelds of the
microsphere mode and modes of the coupler. The diﬀerence from Fabry-Perot resonator is that for the microsphere,
coeﬃcients Tk are not ﬁxed parameters but instead, strongly depend on geometry of coupling (e.g. exponentially
on the value of the gap between microsphere and coupler) and are therefore in hands of experimentalist. As we
already emphasized in [9], it is the controllable relation between δ0 and δc that deﬁnes coupling eﬃciency upon given
conﬁguration (accounting both for mode overlap and synchronism and optimized loading to provide energy exchange
between resonator and coupler). Stationary solution for (3) has the typical form:

It can be easily seen from this equation that the output signal can be considered as the result of interference of the
input and the ”re-emission” from the resonator. Note that mode distribution of the second term in (7) (resonator
mode emission pattern) does not depend on the input distribution.

The most important case of (7) is the regime of ideal matching (Γ = 1), obtained with Bin/Bin = T/T when the
fraction of the input power fed into the resonator mode is maximal. (Single-mode coupler is always ”mode-matched”.)
In this case, provided δc = δ0, output intensity turns to zero i.e. the entire input power is lost inside the resonator.
This regime is usually called critical coupling. Sometimes coupling is characterized by the fractional depth K of the
resonance dip in intensity transmittance observed upon varying the frequency of exciting wave in the coupler; from
(8) K can be expressed as follows

In case of critical coupling K = 1 (100%). In case of nonideal matching, critical coupling may be observed until
2Γ 2 > 1 (partial matching) if the output is mode-ﬁltered to pick up only part of the coupler modes. In this case
leakage into other modes may be considered as additional internal losses, and critical coupling is obtained with lower
loaded quality factor when δc = δ0/(2Γ 2
δ0 (overcoupling) then for matched coupling the output wave in
resonance has the sign opposite to that out of resonance i.e. the resonator shifts phase by π. It is appropriate to note
here that in traditional high-Q optical resonators comprised of mirrors, the quality-factor is limited by the mirrors’
ﬁnesse i.e. by loading. With microspheres, the situation is opposite, and the primary role belongs to the intrinsic
quality-factor.

III. DIRECTIONAL COUPLER APPROACH

The goal of this section is to determine parameters of the coupler-resonator system from the electrodynamical point
of view. In the recent paper [15] by D.R.Rowland and J.D.Love, famous for their popular book on the theory of
optical waveguides [16], the problem of coupling with whispering-gallery modes is addressed on the basis of the model
of distributed coupling between a travelling surface mode in cylindrical resonator and a given mode in a planar (slab)
waveguide. In this approach, the coupling problem leads to the necessity to solve a system of diﬀerential equations,
which in our designations looks as follows:

Coeﬃcients ∆β0(z) and ∆βk(z) (describing perturbation of wave numbers β0 and βk of modes of the resonator and
the coupler) and distributed coupling coeﬃcients ck can be calculated explicitly as ﬁeld cross-section integrals (see
[15] and references therein).

Here e0 and ek are equivalent waveguide modes of the resonator and of the coupler respectively, normalized vs. power;
the integration is done over cross-sections. Indexes S and C denote that the integration is done inside the microsphere
and coupler respectively. In principle, conservation of energy requires that the two integrals in expression for C2
k be
equal and this is frequently postulated. However, in common approximation that we also use here the above equality is
secured only for phase-matched or identical waveguides, while in the opposite case the dependence of the two integrals
on the gap is diﬀerent. Nevertheless, to provide eﬃcient coupling, this equality must be satisﬁed.

Parameters (11) are nonzero only in the coupling zone. It may seem that the coupler transmission matrix (CTM)
and, subsequently, the above introduced lumped Tk coeﬃcients can be found from equations (10). However, analytical
derivation of the output ﬁeld amplitudes cannot be found from (10) with exception of few simple cases. It was perhaps
due to this fact that the authors of [15] presented only numerical solution for their particular case. Moreover, in general
case CTM is a complex 2x2 matrix and cannot be characterized by one real parameter.

Fortunately, the situation is more favorable for optical microsphere resonators with high loaded quality-factor
1. Indeed, from (4) it follows that T 2 = m/Q. In a fused silica resonator with the diameter
Qc = ω/2δc, when Tk ≪

In practice T is usually of the order of 10−3. It means that the ﬁeld amplitude A0 changes insigniﬁcantly over the

Equations (12) are practically identical to (2) if A0 is closed into a ring. In the second equation of (12) we neglected

in resonant frequency and the reduction of Q by loading.

Directional coupler approach can be easily generalized for multimode coupler. However expressions for the coupling
parameters better suited for couplers with dense mode spectrum can be found in a more rigorous way directly from
Maxwell equations using variational methods. Electric ﬁeld in the resonator perturbed by coupler may be written in
the form:

where ˆej are orthonormalized eigenmodes of the unperturbed lossless resonator without coupler

(δj1,j2 is Kronecker symbol here). Rigorously speaking this normalization meets some diﬃculties for open dielectric
resonators with ﬁnite radiative quality-factor Qrad [17]. In our consideration, however, we can avoid them by assuming
eigenfrequences of interest ωj to be purely real. For this we neglect the imaginary part that describes radiation losses
and choose as the integration volume the sphere with a diameter much less than Qradλ/π. Amplitudes ˆAj are slowly
varying and diﬀer from circulating amplitude Aj introduced before only in terms of normalization. One can easily

V. APPLICATION TO DEMONSTRATED COUPLERS

Let us now use the developed approach for the analysis of coupling of whispering-gallery modes with optical ﬁber.
As soon as according to (refkcoupl), possibility of eﬃcient coupling critically depends on the value of the loading
quality-factor Qc and its relation with the intrinsic Q, in this section we shall focus on calculation of Qc and discuss
brieﬂy methods to achieve phase synchronism and mode matching with diﬀerent couplers.

To date, two types of optical ﬁber coupler to WG modes in microsphere were demonstrated. The ﬁrst one is the
eroded ﬁber coupler [5,11,12], where evanescent ﬁeld of a propagating waveguide mode becomes accessible due to
partial removal of the cladding in a bent section of the ﬁber. The recently demonstrated second type of the ﬁber
coupler is based on the stretched section of a single mode ﬁber employing the mode conversion of the initial guided
wave into waveguide modes of cladding tapered to the diameter of few microns [13].

The most interesting type of strong conﬁnement modes of the sphere - TEℓℓq with radius a (where radial index q is

small) and the HE11 mode in the ﬁber of radius b can be approximated as follows [18,16]:

106 and Qc = 2.6

106. Calculations with (35) give Qc = 2.5

for λ = 1.55 µm, a = 85 µm and b = 1.7 µm. The measured Q was 2
Q0 = 8.5

Using the above expressions, we can try to compare our calculations with the experimental data reported in [13]
106 with K = 72%. Using (9) we can obtain
106 – in agreement with the experiment.
It is appropriate to note here that in principle, as follows from (34), the minimum of Qc does not correspond to
2/√ℓ - several percents
phasematching (β = ℓ/a) and is shifted to smaller b. This minimum is also not very sharp (
of β). However this case deserves special consideration, because for smaller b the approximations we use here will
give larger (more than 10%) error. It is also important that the loaded Q increases very quickly with the size of
the resonator (as ℓ5/2), and in this way the range of possible applications of such coupler becomes restricted. Even
for very small fused-silica spheres, optimal radius of most common silica ﬁber does not correspond to single-mode
operation implying further technical complications in using this type of coupler.

The conclusions of our theory also correlate with the data on limited eﬃciency of sidepolished optical ﬁber couplers
[5,11,12]. Indeed, with the typical monomode ﬁbers having core index equal or smaller than that of the spheres (made
from polystyrene or silica correspondingly in [5,11,12], with small microspheres one cannot satisfy phasematching
because of relatively large diameter of standard cores, and with larger spheres coupling coeﬃcient is too small (coupling
Q-factor too high) to provide eﬃcient power insertion into the resonator.

Eﬃcient coupling (tens of %) with high-Q microspheres has been demonstrated with the planar (slab) waveguides
[19]. This type of the coupler provides additional freedom compared to ﬁber waveguides because it allows free
manipulation of the two-dimensional optical beams. Optimal width for ℓℓq mode is g = 2a/√2ℓ. In the meantime
requirement of phase matching for eﬃcient coupling implies optimization of the slab waveguide thickness f . Using
the same approach as above, we obtain:

It is appropriate to note here that either ﬁbers or planar waveguides can also eﬀectively excite modes with ℓ

= m if
the wavevector is inclined to the “equator” plane of the sphere (symmetry plane of the residual ellipticity) by angle
arccos(m/ℓ). This conclusion becomes evident if we remember that the mode with ℓmq is equivalent to a precessing
inclined fundamental ℓℓq mode [10].

Prism coupler has been analyzed in our previous papers [9,10] together with precession approach to the description of
WG modes and theoretical and experimental investigation of the far ﬁeld patterns. By contrast to waveguide couplers,
where practical realization of high eﬃciency implies either precise engineering of the waveguide parameters, or the step-
by-step search of the optimal contact point to the ﬁber taper, prism coupler allows systematic procedure of coupling
optimization by manipulating the external beams. The two steps to achieve eﬃcient coupling are 1)adjustment of the
incidence angle Φ of the input Gaussian beam inside the coupler prism and 2) adjustment of the angular size of the
beam ∆Φ and ∆Θ to provide mode matching with far ﬁeld of the WG mode in the prism (Γ factor).

Fig.2 summarizes the calculations of the loading quality-factor for diﬀerent types of couplers (with optimized

to achieve critical coupling with the given size and intrinsic Q of the sphere, along the lines summarized in Sec.2 (9).

In our experiments employing high-Q WG microsphere resonators, we used prism coupler in most cases and believe
that it remains the most ﬂexible device as it provides ability of ﬁne adjustment of both phase synchronism and mode
matching via convenient manipulation of the apertures and incidence angles of free beams. Also, as seen in Fig.2, it
provides a signiﬁcant margin to obtain critical coupling with the spheres of various size and intrinsic Q. As a result, we
routinely obtained coupling eﬃciencies to silica microspheres about 30% with standard right-angle BK7 glass prisms
limited by restricted mode overlap due to input refraction distortions of the symmetrical Gaussian beams. Use of
cylindrical optics or higher refraction prisms to eliminate the mode mismatch (Γ
1) can signiﬁcantly improve
coupling eﬃciency and approach full exchange of energy under critical regime. (About 80% coupling eﬃciency is
demonstrated further in the experimental Sec.7).

To conclude this section, let us also note here that the critical coupling (that is characterized by maximal absorption
of the input power in the resonator) is in fact useless for such applications as cavity QED or quantum-nondemolition
experiments, because no recirculated power escapes the cavity mode. To be able to utilize the recirculated light, one
Q0 (strong overcoupling). In other words, the intrinsic quality-factor has to be
has to provide the inequality Qc ≪
high enough to provide reserve for suﬃcient loading by the optimal coupler.

VI. PRISM COUPLER: EXPERIMENTAL EFFICIENCY AND VARIABLE LOADING REGIMES

In order to illustrate the results of our analysis, we performed measurements to characterize coupling eﬃciency
of the prism coupler with high-Q fused silica microspheres. As in our previous experiments, we used microspheres
fabricated of high-purity silica preforms by fusion in a hydrogen-oxygen microburner (see description of the technique
in [20]). The focus of present experiment was to obtain enhanced coupling by maximizing the mode matching

along with the lines brieﬂy described in Sec.2. In our experiment, to diminish astigmatic distortions of the input
gaussian beam at the entrance face of the coupler prism, we used equilateral prism of ﬂint glass (SF-18, refraction
index n= 1.72). As usual, the input beam (a symmetrical gaussian beam from a single-mode piezo-tunable He-Ne
laser) was focused onto the inner surface of the prism, at the proximity point with the microsphere. The angle of
incidence and the cross-section of the input beam were then optimized to obtain maximum response of a chosen WG
mode. Initial alignment was done on the basis of direct observation of resonance interference in the far ﬁeld, with
the frequency of the laser slowly swept across the resonance frequency of the mode. With the given choice of prism
1 (close to critical angle of total
material, optimal angle of incidence for excitation of whispering-gallery modes q
internal refraction at the silica-glass interface) was approximately equal to 60 degrees so that astigmatic distortions
of the input beam at the entrance face of the prism were minimized.

After preliminary alignment, the coupling eﬃciency was further maximized on the basis of direct observation of the
resonance absorption dip: full intensity of the beam after the coupler prism was registered by linear photodetector and
monitored on digital oscilloscope. Results obtained with a T Mℓℓq mode (possessing strongest conﬁnement of the ﬁeld
in meridional direction) are presented in Fig.3 in form of the resonance curves observed upon successively decreasing
coupling (stepwise increasing gap). Fig.3 illustrates good agreement of theory with experiment:
indeed, resonance
transmission decreases with loading until the quality-factor becomes twice smaller than the intrinsic Q0; after that,
intensity contrast of the resonance decreases. Fig.4 presents explicitly the plot of the ﬁtted experimental intensity dip
versus the loaded quality-factor Q = QcQ0/(Qc + Q0), which yields satisfactory agreement with parabolic prediction
from the generalized expression (9). Maximal contrast of the resonance obtained in our experiment was K 2
0.79
(the ”deepest” curve in Fig.3).

VII. CONCLUSION

We have presented a general approach to describe the near-ﬁeld coupling of high-Q whispering-gallery modes in
optical microsphere resonators to guided or free-space travelling waves in coupler devices with continuous and discrete
spectrum of propagating modes.

A convenient formalism of the loaded quality-factor to describe the energy exchange between coupler modes and
the resonator provides a quick algorithm to determine the eﬃciency of the given type of the coupler, under given
value of the intrinsic quality-factor of WG modes.

Variable relation between the intrinsic Q-factor and loading losses (described by Qc) through energy escape to
coupler modes is a distinctive new property of whispering-gallery resonators compared to conventional Fabry-Perot

8

cavities: the latter are characterized by ﬁxed coupling through the reﬂectivities of comprising low-loss mirrors. This
unique ability to control the Q and coupling via WG mode evanescent ﬁeld allows to obtain new regimes in the
devices, analogous to those available in lumped-element RF and microwave engineering.

Theoretical estimates on the basis of the suggested theory are in good agreement with the reported data on the

eﬃciency of diﬀerent coupler devices including tapered, sidepolished ﬁber and slab waveguide.

Original experimental results include direct demonstration of variable loading and enhanced eﬃciency (up to about
80% ) in prism coupler. Ease of control of phase synchronism and mode overlap between coupler and microsphere
mode by adjusting the input beam parameters make the prism coupler versatile and eﬃcient for various applications
of high-Q microsphere resonators.

In conclusion, let us note that the near-ﬁeld coupling may be not a unique method to eﬃciently excite highly conﬁned
whispering-gallery modes in microspheres. Simple estimates show that for example, recent advances in optical ﬁber
grating fabrication methods [21] may allow to ”imprint” a Bragg-type critical coupler for high-Q WG modes directly
on a sphere made of low-loss germanosilicate glass. This conﬁguration might be of special interest for atomic cavity-
QED experiments, where presence of bulky external couplers may destroy the ﬁeld symmetry, complicate laser cooling
of atoms etc.

Electromagnetic modes in dielectric equilateral triangle resonators

G. M. Wysin∗

Manhattan, KS 66506-2601
(Dated: July 1, 2005)

Resonant electromagnetic modes are analyzed inside a dielectric cavity of equilateral triangular
cross section and refractive index n, surrounded by a uniform medium of refractive index n′. The ﬁeld
conﬁnement is determined only under the requirements needed to maintain total internal reﬂection
of the internal electromagnetic ﬁelds, matched to exponentially decaying evanescent waves outside
the cavity. Two-dimensional electromagnetics is considered, with no dependence on the coordi-
nate perpendicular to the cross section; hence, independent transverse electric (TE) and transverse
magnetic (TM) polarizations are described separately. A linear combination of six plane waves is
suﬃcient within the cavity, whose wavevectors are related by 120◦ rotations and whose phases are
related by Fresnel reﬂection coeﬃcients. Generally, the mode spectrum becomes sparse and the
minimum mode frequency increases rapidly as the index ratio N = n/n′ approaches 2. For speciﬁed
quantum numbers and N, the TM modes are lower in frequency than the TE modes. Assuming the
evanescent boundary waves escape at the triangle vertices, TE modes generally are found to have
greater conﬁnement of the ﬁelds inside the cavity and much higher quality factors than TM modes.

INTRODUCTION

Conﬁnement of electromagnetic ﬁelds only by to-
tal
internal reﬂection (TIR) oﬀers a path for design
of simple optical resonators or lasers with low volume
and low threshold power. To this end, various two-
dimensional (2D) geometries have been considered for
their diﬀerent inﬂuence on the mode properties, includ-
ing disks,[1] cleaved[2] and etched[3] semiconductor tri-
angles, squares,[4, 5, 6] and zeolite ALPO4-5 hexagonal
crystals.[7, 8] The problem of equilateral triangle res-
onators (ETR) considered here is particularly interesting,
because the symmetry present allows for a considerable
simpliﬁcation of the analysis. Good estimates for the
ETR mode wavefunctions, frequencies, and lifetimes (or
quality factors) are developed here, based on a set of six
plane waves within the resonator, matched to each other
by Fresnel factors, producing exterior evanescent waves.
Chang et al.[2] analyzed the ETR wavefunctions un-
der the assumption of Dirichlet boundary conditions
(DBC), using an exactly known solution[9], for trans-
verse magnetic (TM) polarization only. In the presence
of a dielectric–dielectric boundary, however, the ﬁelds do
not go to zero on the boundary, instead, the ﬁeld con-
ﬁnement can be provided by TIR, assuming a refractive
index in the cavity, n, greater than that of the surround-
ings, n′. Huang et al.[10, 11, 12] made a more complete
analysis for an ETR with dielectric boundary conditions,
approximately matching interior standing wave ﬁelds to
exterior evanescent waves. Mode frequencies and qual-

ity factors Q were estimated[11] from 1000 to as high as
20000, using the ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain technique
(FDTD) and Pad´e approximation[13], with the highest
Q values associated with TM polarization. On the other
hand, typical Q values from 20 – 150 were measured in
photoluminescence (PL) experiments[3] on GaInAs-InP
ETRs with edges from 5 – 20 µm. Recently I analyzed
the ETR modes using the DBC approximation[14], and
assuming the escape of evanescent boundary waves at the
triangle vertices as the primary decay mechanism, esti-
mated typical Q’s from 10 – 500, with the highest values
for TE polarization. Both of these theoretical approaches
involve approximations, thus, it is important to consider
an alternative description of the modes and clarify how
the polarization inﬂuences the mode lifetimes.

The DBC approximation applied previously[2, 14]
clearly does not describe the ﬁelds correctly at a
dielectric–dielectric boundary. The goal here is to use
the general knowledge of the modes from the DBC anal-
ysis, but do the correct matching of plane wave ﬁelds
inside the cavity with evanescent ﬁelds on the outside.
This matching is accomplished by employing the Fres-
nel reﬂection coeﬃcients correctly for all the plane wave
components present in the cavity. It is assumed that all
the electromagnetic ﬁeld components do not depend on a
z-coordinate perpendicular to the triangular cross section
(i.e., longitudinal wavevector kz = 0). Then Maxwell’s
equations and associated dielectric boundary conditions
lead to separated problems for TM and TE modes. Each
polarization is controlled by one component of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld that must be continuous across the
dielectric-dielectric boundary. For the TM modes, the
controlling wavefunction is the longitudinal electric ﬁeld,
ψ = Ez; for TE modes, it is the longitudinal magnetic
ﬁeld, ψ = Hz.

The exact solution for an ETR with Dirichlet bound-
ary conditions is a superposition of six plane waves of
equal strengths but diﬀerent phases and wavevectors.
The waves undergo a
π phase shift when reﬂecting from
the faces, as required such that the incident and reﬂected
parts cancel exactly at the boundary. Any one of these
waves, when followed through a sequence of reﬂections
due to TIR, returns to its original direction after six re-
ﬂections (see Fig. 1 of Ref. 14).

−

The situation is similar for the ETR with dielec-
tric boundary conditions or Maxwell boundary conditions
(MBC), where the correct ﬁeld matching for Maxwell’s
equations must be applied. For either TE or TM po-
larization, I show that a combination of six plane waves
is still needed within the cavity, related to each other by
the reﬂections from the three cavity faces. For a resonant
mode whose ﬁelds are TIR-conﬁned within the cavity, all
the waves must impinge on the faces at incident angles
greater than the critical angle θc, where

sin θc =

1
N ,

N =

n
n′ .

(1)

The generalization here compared to the DBC problem,
is that when reﬂected from the faces, the waves undergo
phase shifts determined by unit-modulus Fresnel coeﬃ-
cients, as well as being rotated in propagation direction.
The goal here is to determine the correct wavevectors and
complex amplitudes of these six plane waves such that a
fully self-consistent wavefunction is determined.

When incident on the faces from inside the cavity, the
waves produce evanescent waves in the exterior region

description of the exterior ﬁelds, however, an approx-
imate description is possible provided the six interior
plane waves are incident on the cavity faces at angles

less than the cavity size or edge a. Then, there are only
strong evanescent ﬁelds very close to the cavity, and a
description of these based on the transmission amplitude
via Fresnel’s equations is appropriate. The mode life-
time and Q are estimated based on the assumption that
the evanescent boundary waves radiate to the cavity sur-
roundings when they reach the triangle vertices. This is
a “strong damping” approximation, in the sense that the
reﬂection or radiation of boundary wave energy back into
the cavity is assumed to be insigniﬁcant.

The presentation proceeds as follows. First, the MBC
ﬁeld matching of the six plane waves is described. Equa-
tions for allowed quantum indexes are found, giving solu-
tions for the mode wavevectors and wavefunctions. The
wavefunction description is general enough that it de-
scribes equally well the DBC, TM and TE problems,
or any other boundary condition whose reﬂection phase
shift is determined by incident angle. Lifetimes will be
estimated using the boundary wave radiation, and com-
pared to the simpler DBC theory and other analysis.

II. EM FIELDS DESCRIPTION

A. Six interior plane waves

Here I describe the notation for the interior waves (ψ),
with assumed frequency ω = c∗k, where c∗ = c/√ǫµ is
the light speed in the cavity, and the wavevector modu-
lus k is to be determined. The ETR has edge length a,
and xy coordinates are used where the origin is set at its
geometrical center, Fig. 1. An initial wave 1
is supposed
(cid:13)
to emerge from lower edge b0 at an angle α1 = α rela-
tive to the x-axis, and hence has wavevector components
~k1 ≡
(kx, ky) = (k cos α, k sin α). Only certain values of
α will lead to a solution for an eigenmode of the cavity;
determination of the possible values of α is an essential
part of the solution presented here.

This initial wave 1

was formed by reﬂection of a wave
incident on boundary b0 at incident angle θi,1 = 90◦
α.
By consideration of the triangular geometry and using
the law of reﬂection, it is seen that the incident angle
when impinging on boundary b1 will be θi,2 = 60◦
θi,1,
see Fig. 1. As the wave subsequently reﬂects from the
boundaries in ordered sequence b1, b2, b0, etc., the inci-
dent angles on each succeeding boundary simply oscillate
between only two values symmetrically above and below
60◦. Thus, without loss of generality, one can assume
60◦ for the remaining analysis, and take kx and ky
α
as both positive. The sequence of waves gen-

Considerations of the law of reﬂection together with
the equilateral geometry leads to the basic properties of
the six waves, as summarized in Table I. The xy compo-
nents of each wavevector are deﬁned from the αl in the
usual way,

The pair [~k1, ~k6] can be considered the original waves,
from which the others are obtained. Wavevector ~k6 is
simply obtained from ~k1 by reﬂection across the ˆx-axis.
Due to the triangular symmetry, and the unit-modulus
reﬂection coeﬃcient under TIR, all six waves must have
equal magnitudes, but diﬀerent phases. Then the net

where the Al are all of unit modulus, and ψ = Hz for TE

ψ must be continuous across the cavity boundary. The
TE and TM wavefunctions will not be the same, however,
due to the diﬀerent phase shifts implied by the Fresnel
factors.

Now consider what happens to these waves in terms of
their interaction with the lower boundary, b0, which lies
a/(2√3). By appropriate symmetry
parallel to ˆx at y =
transformations, the eﬀects on the other two boundaries
can be inferred. Three of the waves must be receding
from b0 and three must be approaching b0. Using the fact
α < 90◦, for example, writing α = 60◦ + ϑ,
that 60◦
where ϑ < 30◦, the respective angles of the ~kl to the ˆx-
axis are 60◦

Extending such arguments to the other faces, the ray

represented in Fig. 1 will be exploited to determine the

larization at the indicated refractive index ratios N, assuming
unit magnetic permeabilities.

On the other hand, in the usual analysis of the reﬂection,
the correct boundary conditions for Maxwell’s equations
will relate the incident (ψinc.) and reﬂected (ψreﬂ.) ampli-
tudes, measured at the boundary, by a Fresnel reﬂection
factor r(θi),

Here δ(θi) is the phase shift experienced by the wave
upon reﬂection, for incident angle θi, in conditions of
TIR. The θi-dependence of the diﬀerent Fresnel factors
appearing for TE and TM polarization is discussed sub-
sequently in Sec. III, see Fig. 2 for typical dependence
with dielectric boundary conditions.

Expressions (6) and (7) imply that the wave ampli-

tudes A6 and A1 have a relation,

The same type of analysis can be applied to the waves

b0 = b1,

These factors ∆3, ∆5 and ∆6 are now the only quantities
needed to correctly match self-consistently the interior

Eq. (16) leads to, on the other hand,

∆3 + ∆5 + 2∆6 = 2πn6,

(18)

where n6 must also be an integer. Comparing these equa-
tions demonstrates the constraint,

n3 + n5 = 3n6,

(19)

that is, the sum of n3 and n5 must be a multiple of 3.
However, not all possible choices of these integers will
lead to allowed solutions. Once the allowed quantum
numbers n3 and n5 are determined, the amplitude ratios
of the six plane waves will be determined.

Eqs. (17) and (18) merely give some sums of the ∆l
phase factors, whereas, we actually need to determine
each one separately, and more importantly, we need to
ﬁnd the wavevector magnitude k. This is accomplished
by using their deﬁnitions (12) together with the cor-
responding y-components of the wavevectors, obtained
from (2). The necessary components are

In this last expression n6 was eliminated using the con-
straint (19). In the general case, it is not possible to solve
for α in closed form. On the other hand, some straight-
forward analysis of this function, together with numerical
evaluation indicates the region in which to look for the
quantum numbers n3 and n5.

Once α has been determined, the modulus of the
mode’s wavevector, k, can be found from either (23a)
or (23b), or by their combination, written in a form like

Assuming α has been found (see below for DBC, TE

the wavefunction ψ to vanish; there are no modes with

tempting to sketch such ray diagrams.

B. Equilateral triangle cavity with Dirichlet
boundary conditions

It is interesting to check the validity of the six-wave
analysis in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions; this
also helps to locate the allowed n3 and n5 for Maxwell
boundary conditions. The net ﬁeld on the boundary be-
comes zero when the Fresnel phase shifts are all taken to
be δl =
π (this is the limiting phase shift for grazing
incidence, in either TE or TM polarization). Then the
wavevector components reduce to

C. Maxwell boundary conditions: TM or TE

To deﬁne Eq. (24) for p(α) = 0, we require the Fresnel
phase shifts for MBC. For TM polarization, ψ = Ez, and
the Fresnel reﬂection coeﬃcient for electric ﬁeld polarized
perpendicular to the plane of incidence is needed. For
incident angle θi, the formula is[16]

The important diﬀerence, in comparison with that for
TM polarization, is the presence of the factor ǫ/ǫ′ instead
of µ/µ′. This signiﬁcantly enhances the initial rate at
which δ increases with θi, as can be seen in Fig. 2. Both

modes than for TM modes.

increments. The solid circles indicate allowed modes; the solid

DBC solution for the ETR, Eqs. (45) and (46), explained in
the text.

D. Mode solutions: determination of α and (n3, n5)
pairs, Maxwell boundary conditions

MBC, similar to Eq. (33), the search for possible (n3, n5)
pairs must take place in the range

n5 < n3 < 2n5 + 3.

(41)

Now consider the solution of Eq. (24) for α under
MBC. As shown earlier, there are no solutions with
α = 60◦, because such a choice causes the wavefunction
(29) to vanish. The other extreme, α = 90◦, which re-
quires n3 = n5, is prohibited because wave 6
can never
(cid:13)
experience TIR at a vanishing incident angle. Then, for

It is straightforward to calculate p(α) [Eq. (24)] numer-
ically and determine the zero crossings, which only take
place provided that n3 is fairly close to the upper limit
of (41). Choices of n3, n5 were made as follows. Start-
0, calculate n3 = 2n5 + 3, which
ing from some n5 ≥
gives a prohibited pair at α = 60◦. Automatically the

sum (n3 + n5) is a multiple of 3. Then the ﬁrst pair
to check for a valid solution, is to take n3 reduced by
n5 + 1),
1 (n3 →
such that the sum is the same multiple of 3. The result-
ing pair (n3, n5) will likely have a solution for α if n5 is
adequately large. This initial pair is equivalently set by

1) and n5 increased by 1 (n5 →

n3 −

n3 = 2n5,

n5 = 1, 2, 3 . . .

(42)

Other pairs to try are found by continuing the reduction
of n3 by 1 together with the incrementing of n5 by 1.
The solution for α must occur within the range

60◦ < α < 90◦

θc,

−

(43)

, θi,6 = 90◦

because the incident angle of wave 6
α,
(cid:13)
cannot surpass the critical angle. Therefore, there is a
considerably larger range for possible solutions for α as
the index ratio increases (smaller θc). Conversely, an
index ratio only slightly above 2.0 makes a substantially
limited search range for α, as a result, fairly large values
of n5 are required before a solution is found.

−

Plots of p(α) are surprisingly close to linear, especially
for larger index ratio N and TM polarization. Examples
are shown in Fig. 3 for index ratio N = 8, with various
(n3, n5) pairs [or in terms of (m, n)] and TM polarization.
One should note that the various p(α) curves at diﬀerent
quantum numbers are closely related; the obvious visible
change occurs in the typical slopes as n3 and n5 are ad-
justed, while the δi(α) do not change. The dependence
of some p(α) curves on N is indicated in Fig. 4, at ﬁxed
(n3, n5) = (2, 1) for TE polarization. The terminating
points of these curves occur at αc = 90◦
θc. Then, the
possibility for a zero crossing is greatly enhanced as N
increases. Similar plots for TM polarization show curves
much closer to linear form. The strong downward curva-
ture as α
αc for TE polarization means that for given
quantum numbers, a TE polarized mode can be excited
at lower index ratio than the same TM mode.

IV. CALCULATIONS OF MODE SPECTRA
AND PROPERTIES

Having found (n3, n5) pairs and associated α, we can
look at the mode dependence on polarization and refrac-
tive index ratio N. Henceforth, modes will be labeled by
the quantum number pairs, (m, n).

A. TM polarization

For TM polarization, the frequencies of the lowest
modes are displayed in Fig. 5 for N = 3.2, in terms of
their dependences on the mode indexes (m, n), deﬁned
in Eq. (34). This value for index ratio was used in Ref.
17 in numerical and experimental studies of ETR semi-
conductor cavities, with a diﬀerent theoretical analysis of
the modes. In general, the trend is for ka to increase with

ysis, the allowed modes for MBC must have indexes m
and n either both odd, or both even (parity constraint).
Note, however, that the TM mode wavevectors for cho-
sen (m, n) are noticeably lower than the values expected
from the simpliﬁed DBC theory, expression (35), see Figs.
9 and 13 below. This can be attributed to the fact that
the reﬂection phase shifts [from (38)] due not tend to-
wards

π even at very large index ratio N.

The positions of the ka upper limits (see dotted lines
in Fig. 5) can be estimated quite accurately by using the
TIR cutoﬀ for a mode from the DBC theory[14]. Using
the DBC solutions, all six plane waves can maintain TIR
at all the boundaries only when

An example of this is given in Fig. 6, showing the corre-
sponding results for index ratio N = 8. A larger number
of states appears for each n, although the mode wavevec-
tors have changed slightly.[19] Conversely, as N decreases
below the value 2.0, the DBC-TIR upper limit passes the
lower limit, leaving no modes that can be conﬁned by
TIR. Furthermore, as long as N > 2.0, the total num-
ber of modes is not ﬁnite, since n can be adjusted to an
adequately large value to reach the fundamental mode.
The main eﬀect of placing N very close to 2.0 will be to
force the lowest frequency mode to a large value of ka

Furthermore, all these TIR-conﬁned modes are doubly
degenerate, since one can choose the two values
kx and
form degenerate pairs of states. Alternatively, diﬀerent
degenerate wavefunctions can be obtained by putting the
overall amplitude A0 = eiθ0, choosing some arbitrary
phase θ0, and using only the real part of (29). The de-

polarization. Again, the allowed mode indexes satisfy the
parity constraint, and the ka values fall within the limits
of the DBC-TIR theory. On the other hand, there are two
primary diﬀerences compared to TM polarization. First,
the fundamental mode has a lower (m, n) pair, and in
addition, a slightly lower ka than for the fundamental
mode with TM polarization. Second, at a given (m, n),
we see that the wavevectors for TE polarization always
are noticeably higher than for TM polarization.

At N = 3.2, the TE fundamental is (m, n) = (2, 4),
Fig. 11, however, the Q for this mode is extremely low,
so that it cannot be considered stable.

In Fig. 12 we illustrate the eﬀect of decreasing N down
to the value 2.5, closer to the extreme limit 2.0 . Two
low modes at m = 4 and m = 5 have been squeezed
out by the lower DBC-TIR upper limit, as well as the
entire spectrum becoming narrower. Of course, a similar
squeezing eﬀect takes places for the TM spectrum.

The dependence of some TE mode wavevectors on in-
dex ratio is shown in Fig. 13. Compared to the TM
modes, the TE modes show a stronger variation with
N, especially just above the cutoﬀ ratio. The plot also
shows the DBC mode wavevectors as dotted lines, termi-
nating at the cutoﬀs predicted by the DBC-TIR theory,
Eq. (47). Once N reaches adequately large values, the
wavevectors from the calculations for dielectric bound-
ary conditions asymptotically approach the DBC values.
This can be attributed to the extra factor of ǫ/ǫ′ in the
TE phase shift formula (40), which easily causes all the
π, the value
reﬂection phase shifts to rapidly approach
under Dirichlet boundary conditions.

−

The ﬁelds diminish more rapidly near the cavity edges
for TE polarization than for TM polarization. At N =
8.0, the fundamental modes have (m, n) = (1, 3), whose
corresponding wavefunction is the simplest possible, hav-
ing a single nodal line across the cavity, Fig. 14. The
avoidance of the ﬁelds close to the cavity boundaries of
the TE mode is apparent, whereas, the TM ﬁelds tend

Taken together, these results emphatically conﬁrm the
idea presented in Ref. 14 that the simple DBC theory is
much more appropriate for TE polarization than for TM
polarization.

proximate. The assumption of evanescent traveling
waves along each boundary, rotating around the trian-
gle in the exterior region, is not exact, because the edges
are of ﬁnite length.
In reality, any of the evanescent
waves can be expected to scatter from the triangle ver-
tices, leading to radiation away from the cavity, and re-
ﬂection of that evanescent wave backwards from the ver-
tices. There should be linear combinations of evanescent
traveling waves moving in both directions along the edges
(standing waves). This in turn would lead to a mixing
of the doubly degenerate modes, i.e., the degeneracy will
be split due to the scattering experienced by the ﬁelds at
the triangular vertices.

In the case of modes whose exterior wavelength is small
compared to the cavity edge, these eﬀects may be small,
and ignoring the resulting degeneracy splitting, we can
try to estimate the power loss, and hence, the mode life-
time. To accomplish this, following Wiersig[18], it is as-
sumed that all the power in the evanescent boundary
waves is radiated when reaching the vertices of the trian-
gle, without reﬂecting backwards from the vertices. The
lifetime τ and Q-factor are calculated by

τ = U/P,

Q = ωτ = 2πf τ,

The total boundary wave power is taken as the sum
of the powers from boundary waves on each edge. At
each edge there are three diﬀerent incident waves, each of
which generates an evanescent wave. For example, on b0,
separately produce the evanescent

evanescent boundary waves at the vertices. This ap-
proach was used also to estimate the mode lifetimes using
the DBC solutions[14]; there it was found that generally
speaking, the TE modes have longer lifetimes than the
corresponding TM modes, provided the index ratio N is
large. It is important to check the relative mode lifetimes
using the more correct dielectric boundary conditions. As
the present solution has demonstrated the avoidance of
TE ﬁelds near the cavity boundaries, one might expect
the TE lifetimes to be longer.

The factor of ǫ′/ǫ < 1 for TE polarization tends to reduce
the lifetime, however, the phase shifts in the denominator
have an even larger eﬀect, such that typically, the TEm,n
lifetime is found to be longer than the TMm,n lifetime.
The summation of power terms in the denominator is
usually dominated by that of wave 6

smallest incident angle. The expression is scaled by a/c∗,
the time for the signal to cross the cavity. A well-deﬁned

Numerical results for Q versus index ratio are displayed
for the lowest modes in Fig. 15, for TE and TM polar-
izations, assuming µ = µ′. One ﬁnds that Q’s for TE
modes are considerably larger than for TM modes, espe-
cially far enough above the cutoﬀ N for a given mode.

only slightly above cutoﬀ, and very weakly bound with small
Q and b) N = 8.0, substantially above the cutoﬀ, with much
higher Q, and ﬁeld amplitude concentrated away from the
boundaries.

Furthermore, the TM quality factors tend to saturate at
large N, while the TE quality factors tend to increase
proportional to N2 = ǫ/ǫ′. This latter eﬀect can be seen
due to the asymptotics for the TE reﬂection phase shift,
based on the identity,

The net result is that Q and τ for TE modes are propor-

not present for TM polarization.

It is interesting to observe the changes in the wave-
functions with increasing N or eﬀectively, increasing Q.

central lobe of ψ is connected to one vertex of the bound-
ary, and another lobe is nearly coupled to the opposite
edge. At higher N (and much higher Q), these interior
lobes have become completely detached from the bound-
ary, and the ﬁelds appear more concentrated within the
interior, farther from the boundaries.

A comparison can be made between the results using
dielectric boundary conditions and those from the sim-
pliﬁed DBC theory[14]. Fig. 17 shows Q and τ results for
the modes (1, 3) and (2, 4), as derived from the two ap-
proaches, using the total power in all boundary waves for
this comparison. Indeed, there are only minor diﬀerences
between the lifetimes, mostly near the cutoﬀ index ratios,
due to the fact that the DBC theory overestimates the
cutoﬀs. For the quality factors, the discrepancy between
the approaches is much greater for the TM modes, pri-
marily because the DBC theory has overestimated their
frequencies (or wavevectors). Nevertheless, the ability of
the simpliﬁed DBC theory to predict the general trends
with N is remarkable.

D. Comparison with other ETR theory for
dielectric boundary conditions

ETR modes have previously been analyzed by Huang
et al.(HGW)[10] using diﬀerent approximations, also in-
volving matching of interior ﬁelds undergoing TIR to ex-
terior evanescent ﬁelds. In particular, HGW used what
was called a “perfectly conﬁned approximation for the
transverse wavefunction.” This is a Dirichlet boundary
condition on part of the full wavefunction, giving the y-
component of wavevector 1
(cid:13)

[Eq. (9) of Ref. 10],

kya =

(m + 1),

m = 0, 1, 2, . . .

(57)

2π
√3

Indeed, this is the same as Eq. (32) reviewed here for
the DBC problem, with m + 1 equivalent to n = n6 + 2.
Thus, it is noticeably diﬀerent from the result for dielec-
tric boundary conditions, Eq. (23b), which more fully ac-
counts for all the reﬂection phase shifts. The factor m+1
begins at the value 1, whereas, in our results, the mini-
mum value of equivalent quantum index n is 3. For the
other component of wavevector 1
, the result obtained
(cid:13)
[Eq. (21) of Ref. 10] is similar to Eq. (23a),

kxa =

2θ,

l = 3, 4, 5, . . .

(58)

2π
3

l

−

where l has the same parity as m, and θ is an indi-
vidual TIR Fresnel phase shift, having diﬀerent forms
for TM and TE modes.
Index l appears equivalent to
n5, however, Eq. (23a) involves phase shifts of
m = n3 −
two diﬀerent waves, instead of the individual phase shift
θ.

For a chosen value of n, diﬀerent choices of m give
solutions with ka of similar magnitude, like the modes
connected by solid lines in Figs. 5, 6, 10 and 12. This
“number of transverse modes” increases with both n and
N, and is smaller than that found in Ref. 10. Because
ka = 2πN/λ depends on (m, n) in a nontrivial way, it
is not possible to give a simple expression for this mode
count.

For N = 3.2, a summary is made of the lowest TM
and TE modes in Tables III and IV and compared to
results from HGW. In spite of the obvious diﬀerences in
these theoretical approaches, they both lead to very sim-
ilar predictions for the mode wavevectors or frequencies,
agreeing to within about one percent. The prediction of
the Q-values are considerably diﬀerent; HGW used the
ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) technique[13] com-
bined with Pad´e approximates to estimate Q. In partic-
ular, the FDTD technique predicts that TE polarization
results in much smaller Q than TM polarization[11], ex-
actly opposite to our results (Fig. 15). The short lifetime
for TE modes was explained by the zero in the reﬂectivity
at the Brewster angle θB, which is only slightly less than
the critical angle. However, in a conﬁned TIR wavefunc-
tion, all six plane wave components must impinge on the
faces at angles greater than θc and hence greater than θB,

so it is hard to understand how the Brewster minimum
comes into play, unless diﬀractive eﬀects at the triangle
vertices are strong, causing violation of the six-wave as-
sumption.

E. Mode generation near 1.55 µm free space
wavelength

There has been recent interest, both experimental
and theoretical, in using semiconductor ETRs operat-
ing around 1.55 µ m wavelength. [3, 10, 11, 17] Here we
assume a cavity medium with n = 3.2, surrounded by
vacuum, and summarize the mode spectra obtained by
the present theory, for some typical cavity edge lengths,
a = 2µm and a = 5µm. Of course, all mode frequencies
simply scale as 1/a, thereby giving the primary tuning
control parameter. Modes whose wavelength outside the
cavity ranging from approximately 1.30µm to 1.60µm are
considered; this corresponds to frequency range 187 THz
< f < 231 THz.

Results for all the modes found from 1.3 to 1.6 µm are
shown in Table V for TM and TE polarization. Obvi-
ously very few modes occur in any such narrow range if
the cavity is small (a = 2µm), which could allow for ﬁne
frequency tuning. Conversely, many modes are present
in larger cavities (such as a = 10µm) and single mode
operation is diﬃcult. A cavity with a = 5µm has a
moderate number of modes; the TM mode wavelengths
are similar to those found in photoluminescence (PL)
experiments[3].
In fact, ﬁve of TM mode wavelengths
calculated here are about 2% lower than ﬁve peaks seen
in Fig. 2 of Ref. 3. This deviation might be attributed

primarily to an uncertainty in the cavity size, and sec-
ondly, caused by a weak variation of dielectric constant
with wavelength.[3] Discounting these factors, the agree-
ment for the 5µm cavity is reasonable. Comparison with
the experimental spectrum for a = 10µm is more dif-
ﬁcult, although it appears that some of the TMm,m+2
modes from the present theory (not shown) do appear
in the PL data, again allowing for uncertainty in a and
dispersion.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The phase relationships between the six plane waves
within an ETR have been determined so they match cor-
rectly to each other and to exterior evanescent waves,
according to Fresnel reﬂection coeﬃcients for a dielec-
tric on dielectric boundary at index ratio N = n/n′. The
theoretical wavefunction description is actually very gen-
eral; it applies to any choice of reﬂection phase shifts,
including those for DBC, and TE or TM polarizations.
The main approximation here has been that the evanes-
cent ﬁelds do not perturb the interior ﬁelds; assuming
the evanescent ﬁelds radiate at the triangle vertices (a
strong damping approximation), the mode lifetimes and
quality factors have been estimated. Modes with high Q
should be very well described by the wavefunction (29).
The mode wavevectors are consistent with previous anal-
yses [10, 11, 17], although the wavefunction description
and quality factors diﬀer from the FDTD technique[11]
results. Some mode results are consistent with PL ex-

16

perimental data on 5µm semiconductor ETRs[3].

For N adequately above the cutoﬀ for a mode (m, n),
the TE mode wavevectors are very close to the predic-
tions from the simpliﬁed DBC theory, whereas, the TM
mode wavevectors are consistently below the DBC re-
sults. This is because large N results in Fresnel reﬂec-
π, the value for the DBC
tion phase shifts very near
−
theory, only for TE polarization. This causes the TE
wavefunctions to avoid the cavity edges; on the other
hand, the TM wavefunctions have signiﬁcant amplitude
at the edges. For both polarizations, dielectric boundary
conditions give lower cutoﬀ index ratios than from the
DBC theory. As N increases starting from 2.0, the the-
ory demonstrates how the spectrum of available modes
expands (Fig. 5, etc.), but always stays within the limits
predicted from the DBC theory.

An extra factor of ǫ/ǫ′ appears in the lifetime for TE
modes, not present for TM modes. This theory then
predicts considerably larger lifetimes and Q’s for TE po-
larization, whereas the FDTD approach[11] led to larger
Qs for TM modes. At large index ratio, the lifetimes
found here approach the values found in the simpler DBC
theory[14], for both polarizations.

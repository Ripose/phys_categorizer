Gigantic transmission band edge resonance in
periodic stacks of anisotropic layers

Alex Figotin and Ilya Vitebskiy

Abstract. We consider Fabry-Perot cavity resonance in periodic stacks of
anisotropic layers with misaligned in-plane anisotropy at the frequency close to
a photonic band edge. We show that in-plane dielectric anisotropy can result
in a dramatic increase in ﬁeld intensity and group delay associated with the
transmission resonance. The ﬁeld enhancement appears to be proportional to
forth degree of the number N of layers in the stack. By contrast, in common
periodic stacks of isotropic layers, those eﬀects are much weaker and proportional
to N 2. Thus, the anisotropy allows to drastically reduce the size of the resonance
cavity with similar performance. The key characteristic of the periodic arrays
with the gigantic transmission resonance is that the dispersion curve ω (k) at
4
the photonic band edge has the degenerate form ∆ω ∼ (∆k)
, rather than the
2
regular form ∆ω ∼ (∆k)
. This can be realized in specially arranged stacks of
misaligned anisotropic layers. The degenerate band edge cavity resonance with
similar outstanding properties can also be realized in a waveguide environment,
as well as in a linear array of coupled multimode resonators, provided that certain
symmetry conditions are in place.

Gigantic transmission band edge resonance in periodic stacks of anisotropic layers 2

1. Introduction

The subject of this paper is the Fabry-Perot cavity resonance in periodic layered
structures. This phenomenon, known for many decades, is also referred to as the
transmission band edge resonance, because it occurs in the vicinity of photonic band
edge frequencies in ﬁnite photonic crystals and is accompanied by sharp transmission
peaks. This basic eﬀect can occur in a ﬁnite periodic array of any two alternating
It can also be realized in a waveguide
materials with diﬀerent refractive indices.
environment, or in a ﬁnite array of coupled resonators. The only essential requirements
are: (a) low absorption, (b) the appropriate number N of unit cells in the periodic
array, and (c) the presence of a frequency gap (a stop-band) in the frequency spectrum
of the periodic array. The latter is a universal property of almost any lossless
spatially periodic structure. This phenomenon has found numerous and diverse
practical applications in optics. Below we brieﬂy outline some basic features of the
classical band edge resonance in periodic stacks of isotropic layers. We only highlight
those points, which are necessary for the following comparative analysis of stacks
involving anisotropic layers. More detailed information on the relevant aspects of
electrodynamics of layered dielectric media can be found in an extensive literature on
the subject (see, for example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], and references therein).

Consider a simplest periodic array of alternating dielectric layers A and B, as
shown in Fig. 1(a). The layers are made of transparent isotropic materials with
diﬀerent refractive indices nA and nB. Such periodic stacks are also referred to as
a 1D photonic crystal. The electromagnetic eigenmodes of the periodic structure in
Fig. 1(a) are Bloch waves with a typical wave number/frequency diagram shown in
Fig. 1(b).

Consider now a ﬁnite periodic stack composed of N unit cells L in Fig. 1(a).
Such a stack is commonly referred to as a Fabry-Perot cavity. If the number N of the
double layers L is signiﬁcant, the stack periodicity causes coherent interference of light
scattered by the layers interfaces. In practice, periodic stacks having as few as several
periods L, can display almost total reﬂectivity at the band gap frequencies, provided
that the refractive indices nA and nB of the adjacent layers diﬀer signiﬁcantly.

A typical frequency dependence of the ﬁnite stack transmittance is presented
in Fig. 2. The frequency range shown includes the vicinity of the photonic band
edge (BE) g in Fig. 1(b). The sharp transmission peaks below the photonic band
edge frequency ωg correspond to transmission band edge resonances, also known as
Fabry-Perot cavity resonances. At each resonance, the electromagnetic ﬁeld inside the
periodic stack is close to a standing wave composed of a forward and a backward Bloch
eigenmodes with large and nearly equal amplitudes. The slab boundaries coincide with
the standing wave nodes, where the forward and backward Bloch components interfere
destructively, as illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4. The latter circumstance determines
the wave numbers of the forward and backward Bloch components at the resonance
frequencies

where s is the order number of the resonant peak in Fig. 2, and kg is the wave number
corresponding to the photonic band edge.
In our case, kg = π/L. The resonance
frequencies themselves can be expressed in terms of the dispersion relation ω (k) of
the respective frequency band. Indeed, just below the photonic band edge g in Fig.

peaks below the band edge frequency ωg are associated with photonic band edge
resonance.

at the slab boundaries at z = 0 and z = D = N L, the ﬁeld amplitude Ψ (z) always
remains comparable to ΨI to satisfy the electromagnetic boundary conditions (47).
At frequencies outside the resonance transparency peaks, the ﬁeld amplitude inside
the stack drops sharply.

The exact deﬁnition of the physical values plotted in Figs. 3 and 4, as well as the
numerical parameters of the periodic stacks used to generates these plots, are given
in the Appendix.

The expressions (1) through ((5) are valid if N ≫ 1 and only apply to
the transmission resonances close enough to the photonic band edge.
In further
consideration, we will focus on the most powerful ﬁrst resonance s = 1, closest to
the photonic band edge.

Above, we outlined some basic features of the transmission band edge resonance
in ﬁnite stacks of isotropic layers. The question we would like to address in this paper
is whether the presence of anisotropic layers in a ﬁnite periodic stack can qualitatively
change the nature of the Fabry-Perot cavity resonance. We will show that, indeed,
in periodic stacks involving anisotropic layers, the transmission resonance can be
signiﬁcantly stronger, compared to what is achievable with common periodic stacks of
isotropic layers. For instance, in the periodic stack shown in Fig. 5, the ﬁeld intensity
associated with the transmission band edge resonances can be proportional to N 4,
rather than N 2. The latter implies that a stack of N anisotropic layers can perform
as well as a common stack of N 2 isotropic layers. And this is a huge diﬀerence! The
physical reason for this is that periodic stacks of anisotropic layers can support the
kind of k − ω diagrams that are impossible in stacks of isotropic layers. Speciﬁcally, a
dispersion curve ω (k) of the stack in Fig. 5 can develop a degenerate band edge, as
shown in Fig. 6(b). Just below the degenerate band edge d, the dispersion curve can

X − Y plane, and one isotropic B layer. The misalignment angle ϕ = ϕ1 − ϕ2
between adjacent A layers must be diﬀerent from 0 and π/2.

For convenience, the domain of deﬁnition of the Bloch wave number k in Fig. 6 is
chosen between 0 and 2π/L. Since the Bloch wave number is deﬁned up to a multiple
of 2π/L, the representation in Fig. 6 is equivalent to that in Fig. 1(b). Note that the
points a, g, and d in Fig. 6(a) and 6(b) lie at the Brillouin zone boundary at k = π/L.
In Fig. 7 we present the transmission dispersion of the ﬁnite periodic stacks in
Fig. 5 composed of 32 unit cells L and having the k − ω diagram in Fig. 6(b). The
frequency range shown includes the degenerate band edge (DBE) at ω = ωd. The ﬁeld
intensity distribution at the frequency of the ﬁrst transmission resonance 1 is shown
in Fig. 8(b). One can see that for a given N , the resonant ﬁeld intensity in Fig. 8 is
signiﬁcantly larger compared to that of the vicinity of a regular band edge, shown in
Fig. 3. Speciﬁcally, in the case of degenerate band edge

compared to the estimation (5) related to a regular band edge. The transmission
bandwidth in the case of DBE appears to be much smaller.

In practice, the ﬁeld amplitude associated with the transmission resonance is
limited not only by the number of layers in the stack, but also by such factors as
absorption, nonlinearity, imperfections of the periodic array, stack dimensions in the
X − Y plane, incident radiation bandwidth, etc. All else being equal, the stack with
degenerate band edge can have much fewer layers and, therefore, can be much thinner
compared to a regular stack of isotropic layers with similar performance. Much smaller
dimensions can be very attractive for a variety of practical applications. Similar

The amplitude of the incident wave is unity. At the stack boundaries at z = 0
and z = N L, the ﬁeld intensity is of the order of unity, while inside the slab
electromagnetic energy density is enhanced by factor N 4.

eﬀect associated with degenerate band edge (6) of the k − ω diagram can also be
achieved in the waveguide environment, as well as in ﬁnite periodic arrays of coupled
multiple-mode resonators. On the down side, the realization of k − ω diagram having
a dispersion curve with DBE, requires more sophisticated periodic arrays, such as the
one shown in Fig. 5.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2 we brieﬂy outline the electrodynamics of periodic stratiﬁed media
and examine the relation between anisotropy of the layers and the k − ω diagram of
the stack. We show that at the frequency of degenerate band edge d, the 4 × 4 transfer
matrix of a unit cell L cannot be diagonalized or even reduced to the block-diagonal
form. Based on this, we establish necessary symmetry conditions for a periodic
stack to develop a degenerate band edge (6) and to display the peculiar resonance
properties associated with it. We prove that such periodic stacks must have at least
two misaligned anisotropic layers in a unit cell, as shown in the example in Fig. 5.

In Section 3, we consider the scattering problem for a ﬁnite periodic stack.
We analyze the eigenmode composition of electromagnetic ﬁeld at the frequency of
transmission resonance near degenerate band edge. We show that in contrast to the
case (5) of a regular band edge, in the degenerate band edge case (7) the resonance
ﬁeld inside the stack does not reduce to a superposition of forward and backward
propagating eigenmodes. Instead, the contribution of evanescent eigenmodes becomes
equally important and leads to much stronger dependence (7) of the resonance ﬁeld
intensity on the number of layers in the stack.

The physical and geometrical parameters of stacks used for numerical simulations

are speciﬁed in the Appendix.

2. Electrodynamics of periodic stacks of anisotropic layers

This section starts with a brief description of some basic electrodynamic properties of
periodic layered media composed of lossless anisotropic layers. Then we turn to the
particular case of periodic stacks with degenerate band edge. The scattering problem
for periodic ﬁnite stacks, including the Fabry-Perot cavity resonance in the vicinity of
degenerate photonic band edge will be considered in the next section.

2.1. Transverse electromagnetic waves in stratiﬁed media

Our consideration is based on time-harmonic Maxwell equations in heterogeneous
nonconducting media

∇ × ˜E (~r) = i

B (~r) , ∇ × ˜H (~r) = −i

D (~r) ,

ω
c

c

where electric and magnetic ﬁelds and inductions are related by linear constitutive
equations

˜D (~r) = ˆε (~r) ˜E (~r) , ˜B (~r) = ˆµ (~r) ˜H (~r) .

In further consideration we assume that:

(i) The direction of plane wave propagation coincide with the normal z to the layers.
(ii) The second rank tensors ˆε (~r) and ˆµ (~r) are dependent on a single Cartesian

coordinate z, normal to the layers.

(iii) The z direction is a two-fold symmetry axis of the stack, implying that the
anisotropy axes of individual layers are either parallel, or perpendicular the z
direction. The latter deﬁnes the case of in-plane anisotropy.

Under the above restrictions, the normal ﬁeld components Ez and Hz of
electromagnetic wave are zeroes, and the system (8) of six time-harmonic Maxwell
equations reduces to the following system of four ordinary linear diﬀerential equations
for the transverse ﬁeld components

Ψ (z) = i

M (z) Ψ (z) , Ψ (z0) = Ψ0

for the reduced Maxwell equation (10) has a unique solution

Ψ (z) = T (z, z0) Ψ (z0) ,

where the 4 × 4 matrix T (z, z0) is referred to as the transfer matrix. The transfer
matrix (14) uniquely relates the values of time-harmonic electromagnetic ﬁeld Ψ at
any two points z and z0 of the stratiﬁed medium. From the deﬁnition (14), it follows
that

T (z, z0) = T (z, z′) T (z′, z0) , T (z, z0) = T −1 (z0, z) , T (z, z) = I.

(15)

The transfer matrix of a stack of layers is deﬁned as

where z = 0 and z = D are the stack boundaries. The greatest advantage of the
transfer matrix formalism stems from the fact that the transfer matrix of an arbitrary
stack is a sequential product of the transfer matrices Tm of the constitutive layers

TS = T (D, 0) ,

TS =

Tm.

Ym

If the individual layers m are homogeneous, the corresponding single-layer transfer
matrices Tm can be explicitly expressed in terms of the respective Maxwell operators
Mm

Tm = exp (iDmMm) ,

where Dm is the thickness of the m-th layer. The explicit expression for the Maxwell
operator Mm of a uniform dielectric layer with in-plane anisotropy is given by Eq. (12).
Thus, Eq. (16) together with (17) and (12) provide an explicit analytical expression
for the transfer matrix TS of a stack of dielectric layers with in-plane anisotropy.

The 4 × 4 transfer matrix of an arbitrary lossless stratiﬁed medium displays the

fundamental property of J-unitarity [15]

which implies, in particular, that

Diﬀerent versions of the 4 × 4 transfer matrix formalism have been used in
electrodynamics of stratiﬁed media composed of birefringent and/or gyrotropic layers
for decades (see, for example, [10, 12, 11] and references therein).
In this paper
we use exactly the same notations and terminology as in our previous publications
[13, 14, 15, 16] on electrodynamics of stratiﬁed media.

2.2. Eigenmodes in periodic layered media

In a periodic layered medium, all material tensors are periodic functions of z, and so
is the 4 × 4 matrix M (z) in (10). Usually, the solutions Ψk (z) of the reduced Maxwell
equation (10) with the periodic M (z) can be chosen in the Bloch form

Ψk (z + L) = eikLΨk (z) ,

where the Bloch wave number k is deﬁned up to a multiple of 2π/L. The deﬁnition
(14) of the transfer matrix together with Eq. (20) yield

T (z + L, z) Ψk (z) = eikLΨk (z) .

Introducing the transfer matrix of a unit cell L

TL = T (L, 0) ,

we have from Eq. (21)

TLΦk = eikLΦk, where Φk = Ψk (0) .

Thus, the eigenvectors of the transfer matrix TL of the unit cell are uniquely related
to the Bloch solutions Ψk (z) of the reduced Maxwell equation (10)

The respective four eigenvalues

Φi = Ψi (0) , i = 1, 2, 3, 4.

Xi = eikiL, i = 1, 2, 3, 4

F4 (X) = det (TL − XI) = 0.

of TL are the roots of the characteristic polynomial F4 (X) of the forth degree

Unit cell of a periodic stack can be chosen diﬀerently. For example, the choice
A1 − B − A2 speciﬁed in Fig. 5 is as good as A2 − A1 − B. Diﬀerent choice of a unit cell
corresponds to its shift in the z direction and results in the following transformation
of the respective transfer matrix TL

L = T (0, Z) TLT (Z, 0) = [T (Z, 0)]−1
T ′

TLT (Z, 0) ,

(27)

where Z is the amount of the shift. The modiﬁed transfer matrix is similar to the
original one and has the same set of eigenvalues.

For any given ω, the characteristic equation (26) deﬁnes a set of four eigenvalues
(25). Real k (or, equivalently, |X| = 1) correspond to propagating Bloch modes, while
complex k (or, equivalently, |X| 6= 1) correspond to evanescent modes.

The J-unitarity (18) of TL imposes the following restriction on its eigenvalues

Gigantic transmission band edge resonance in periodic stacks of anisotropic layers 12

A. All four wave numbers are real

k1 ≡ k∗

1, k2 ≡ k∗

2, k3 ≡ k∗

3, k4 ≡ k∗
4.

In the example in Fig. 6, this case relates to the frequency range

0 < ω < ωa.

In this case, all four Bloch eigenmodes are propagating.
B. Two wave numbers are real and the other two are complex

k1 = k∗

1, k2 = k∗

2, k4 = k∗

3, where k3 6= k∗

3, k4 6= k∗
4.

(32)

This case relates to the frequency range

in Fig. 6(a), or the frequency range

ωa < ω < ωg,

ωa < ω < ωd,

in Fig. 6(b). In both cases (33) and (34), two of the four Bloch eigenmodes are
propagating and the remaining two are evanescent with complex conjugated wave
numbers.

C. All four wave numbers are complex

k2 = k∗

1, k4 = k∗

3, where k1 6= k∗

1, k2 6= k∗

2, k3 6= k∗

3, k4 6= k∗
4.

(35)

This situation relates to a frequency gap, where all four Bloch eigenmodes are
evanescent. In the example in Fig. 6, this case corresponds to

ωg < ω, or ωd < ω.

(36)

Notice that the case (B) of two propagating and two evanescent modes can only
occur in periodic stacks of anisotropic layers. If all the layers in a unit cell are isotropic,
the four Bloch eigenmodes are either all propagating or all evanescent, as is the case
in Fig. 1. For a given frequency ω, the four Bloch eigenmodes correspond to two
diﬀerent polarizations and two opposite directions of propagation.

2.2.1. Non-Bloch solutions at stationary points of the k − ω diagram So far, we
have considered only the cases where all four solutions for the reduced Maxwell
equation (10) can be chosen in the Bloch form (20). All such cases fall into one
of the following three categories: (A) all four eigenmodes are propagating, (B) two
modes are propagating and the other two are evanescent, (C) all four eigenmodes are
evanescent. This classiﬁcation of the eigenmodes does not apply at the frequencies of
stationary points on the k − ω diagram, where the group velocity u of some of the
propagating modes vanishes

u = dω/dk = 0.

(37)

At a stationary point of a dispersion curve, not all four solutions of the Maxwell
equation (10) are Bloch waves, as deﬁned in (20). Instead, some of the solutions can

Gigantic transmission band edge resonance in periodic stacks of anisotropic layers 13

be algebraically diverging non-Bloch eigenmodes. Such eigenmodes can be essential
for understanding the resonance eﬀects in ﬁnite and semi-inﬁnite periodic arrays.

Let us consider the situation at stationary points (37) on the k − ω diagram
in terms of the matrix TL. Although at any given frequency ω, the reduced Maxwell
equation (10) has exactly four linearly independent solutions, it does not imply that the
respective transfer matrix TL in (23) must have four linearly independent eigenvectors
(23). Indeed, although the matrix TL is invertible, it is neither Hermitian, nor unitary
and, therefore, may not be diagonalizable. Speciﬁcally, if the frequency approaches
one of the stationary points (37), some of the eigenvectors Φk in (23) become nearly
parallel to each other. Eventually, as ω reaches the the stationary point value, the
number of linearly independent eigenvectors Φk becomes lesser than four, and the
relation (24) does not apply at that point.

Examples of diﬀerent stationary points (37) are shown in Fig. 6. Using these

examples, let us take a closer look at these special frequencies.

At the frequencies ωg of the photonic band edge g in Fig.

6(a), the four

eigenmodes include:

- one propagating mode with k = π/L and zero group velocity,
- one non-Bloch eigenmode linearly diverging with z,
- a pair of evanescent modes with equal and opposite imaginary wave numbers.

At the frequencies ωa corresponding to the point a in Fig. 6, the four solutions

of Eq. (10) include:

- the propagating mode with k = π/L and zero group velocity,
- one non-Bloch eigenmode linearly diverging with z,
- a pair of propagating modes having equal and opposite group velocities and

belonging to the dispersion curve other than the one containing the point a.

Of special interest here is the frequency ωd of degenerate photonic band edge d

in Fig. 6(b). In this case, the four solutions of Eq. (10) include [17]:

- the propagating mode with k = π/L and zero group velocity,
- three non-Bloch eigenmodes diverging as z, z2, and z3, respectively.

At any particular frequency, the existence of non-Bloch eigenmodes can be directly
linked to the canonical Jordan form of the respective transfer matrix TL. Indeed, the
4 × 4 matrix TL, being invertible, can have one of the following ﬁve diﬀerent canonical
forms

of which all but ˜T1 have non-trivial Jordan blocks and,
therefore, are not
diagonalizable. Each m × m Jordan block is associated with a single eigenvector
of the respective T - matrix. Therefore, the total number of eigenvectors of diﬀerent
4 × 4 matrix in (38) is lesser than the number four of the solutions for the reduced
Maxwell equation (10). The only exception is the diagonalizable case ˜T1, where the
four TL eigenvectors correspond to four Bloch eigenmodes, as prescribed by (24).
Generally, each nontrivial m × m Jordan block of the T - matrix is associated with
the m eigenmodes of Eq. (10), of which one is a propagating Bloch eigenmode with
zero group velocity, and the other m − 1 are non-Bloch eigenmodes algebraically
diverging with z. The details can be found in any course on linear algebra, for example,
[18, 19, 20, 21]. Let us consider each case separately.

At general frequencies, diﬀerent from those of stationary points (37), the 4 × 4
matrix TL is always diagonalizable. Its canonical (diagonalized) form is trivial and
coincides with ˜T1 in (38). The four eigenvectors are deﬁned in (24). All the possibilities
here reduce to one of the three cases (A), (B), or (C) described earlier in this Section.
None of them involves non-Bloch solutions.

At the frequency ωg of a regular photonic band edge in Fig. 6(a), the canonical

Jordan form of the respective transfer matrix is ˜T21 in (38), where

X1 = −1, X3 = X ∗

3 = X −1

4

6= 1.

The 2 × 2 Jordan block relates to one propagating Bloch mode with k = π/L and
zero group velocity, and one non-Bloch linearly diverging eigenmode. The pair of real
eigenvalues X3 and X4 = X −1

relate to the pair of evanescent modes at ω = ωg.

3

By contrast, at the frequency of photonic band edge g in Fig. 1(b) related to the
stack of isotropic layers, there is no evanescent modes. The canonical Jordan form of
the respective transfer matrix coincides with ˜T22 in (38), where

X1 = X2 = −1.

Each of the two 2 × 2 identical Jordan blocks relates to one propagating Bloch mode
with k = π/L and zero group velocity, as well as one non-Bloch linearly diverging
eigenmode. The two Jordan blocks of ˜T22 correspond to two diﬀerent polarizations of
light.

At the frequency ωa in Fig. 6, the canonical Jordan form of the respective transfer

matrix is ˜T21, where

X1 = −1, X3 = X ∗

4 , |X3| = |X4| = 1.

The double eigenvalue X1 = −1 of the 2 × 2 Jordan block relates to one propagating
Bloch mode with k = π/L and zero group velocity, and one non-Bloch linearly
diverging eigenmode. The pair of complex eigenvalues X3 and X4 = X ∗
3 relate to the
pair of propagating modes having equal and opposite group velocities and belonging
to the dispersion curve other than the one containing the point a.

The canonical form ˜T3 in (38) relates to a k −ω diagram with stationary inﬂection
point. Such a stationary point cannot be realized in a reciprocal periodic stack at
normal light propagation [14, 15].

Of particular interest here is the case (6) of degenerate band edge. At the
degenerate band edge frequency ωd, the canonical Jordan form of the respective

Gigantic transmission band edge resonance in periodic stacks of anisotropic layers 15

transfer matrix is ˜T4 in (38)

(39)

X = Xd = eikdL = −1, at ω = ωd.

The matrix (39) presents a single 4 × 4 Jordan block and has a single eigenvector,
corresponding to the propagating eigenmode with k = π/L and zero group velocity.
The other three solutions for the Maxwell equation (10) at ω = ωd are non-Bloch
eigenmodes diverging as z, z2, and z3, respectively.

If the frequency ω deviates from the stationary point (37), the transfer matrix TL
become diagonalizable with the canonical Jordan form ˜T1 in (38). The perturbation
theory relating the non-Bloch eigenmodes at the frequency of degenerate band edge
to the Bloch eigenmodes in the vicinity of this point is presented in [17].

2.3. Symmetry conditions for the existence of degenerate band edge

Not any periodic stack can develop a degenerate band edge, deﬁned in (6). Some
fundamental restrictions can be derived from symmetry considerations. These
restrictions stem from the fact that at the frequency ωd of degenerate band edge,
the transfer matrix TL must have the Jordan canonical form (39). Such a matrix
cannot be reduced to a block-diagonal form, let alone diagonalized. Therefore,

- a necessary condition for the existence of degenerate band edge is that the
symmetry of the periodic array does not impose the reducibility of the transfer matrix
TL to a block-diagonal form.

The above condition does not imply that the transfer matrix TL must not be
reducible to a block-diagonal form at any frequency ω on the k − ω diagram. Indeed,
at a general frequency ω, the matrix TL is certainly reducible, and even diagonalizable.
The strength of the symmetry imposed reducibility is that it leaves no room for
exceptions, such as the frequency ωd of degenerate band edge, where the transfer
matrix TL must not be reducible to a block-diagonal form. Therefore, in the case of
symmetry imposed reducibility, the very existence of degenerate band edge is ruled out.
Observe that in most periodic layered structures, the symmetry of the periodic array
does require the matrix TL to be similar to a block-diagonal matrix at all frequencies.
In all these cases, the stack symmetry is incompatible with the existence of degenerate
band edge on the k − ω diagram.

Let us apply the above criterion to some speciﬁc cases.
In periodic stacks of isotropic layers, the Maxwell equations for the waves with the
x- and the y - polarizations are identical and decoupled, implying that the respective
transfer matrix can be reduced to the block-diagonal form

The two identical blocks in (40) correspond to two diﬀerent polarizations of light.
The characteristic polynomial F4(X) of the block-diagonal matrix (40) factorizes into
a product of two identical second degree polynomials related to electromagnetic waves
with the x- and the y - polarizations, respectively

F4(X) = F2(X)F2(X).

The block-diagonal structure of the matrix (40) rules out the existence of degenerate

case can only have the following two canonical forms

compatible with (40). The case ˜T1 relates to a general frequency, while the case ˜T22
relates to a photonic band edge, like the one shown in Fig. 1(b).

Let us now turn to the situation where all or some of the layers of the periodic
stack are birefringent. The in-plane dielectric anisotropy (11) may allow for degenerate
band edge on the k − ω diagram, but not automatically.

Let us start with the simplest periodic array in which all anisotropic layers of the
stack have aligned in-plane anisotropy. The term ”aligned” means that one can choose
the directions of the in-plane Cartesian axes x and y so that the permittivity tensors
in all layers are diagonalized simultaneously. In this setting, the Maxwell equations
for the waves with the x- and the y - polarizations are still separated, implying that
the respective transfer matrix can be reduced to the block-diagonal form

The two blocks in (42) correspond to the x and y polarization of light. The forth
degree characteristic polynomial of the block-diagonal matrix (42) factorizes into the
product

F4(X) = Fx(X)Fy(X),

where Fx(X) and Fy(X) are independent second degree polynomials related to
electromagnetic waves with the x- and the y - polarizations, respectively. The typical
k − ω diagram in this case will be similar to that shown in Fig. 6(a) with two separate
curves related to two linear polarizations of light. Again, the block-diagonal structure
of the matrix (42) rules out the existence of degenerate band edge in periodic stacks
with aligned anisotropic layers. The transfer matrix TL in this case can only have the
following two canonical forms

Gigantic transmission band edge resonance in periodic stacks of anisotropic layers 17

compatible with (42). The case ˜T1 relates to a general frequency, while the case ˜T22
relates to a photonic band edge.

As we have seen, the presence of anisotropic layers may not necessarily lift
the symmetry prohibition for the degenerate band edge, because the symmetry of
the periodic array may still be incompatible with the canonical Jordan form (39).
Generally if the space symmetry group G of the layered structure includes a mirror
plane m|| parallel to the z direction, this would guarantee the reducibility of the matrix
TL to a block-diagonal form. Indeed, a standard line of reasoning gives that if m|| ∈ G,
and the y axis is chosen perpendicular to the mirror plane m||, then the waves with
the x- and the y - polarizations have diﬀerent parity with respect to the symmetry
operation of reﬂection and, therefore, are decoupled. The latter leads to reducibility
of the matrix TL to the block-diagonal form (42). Thus, a formal necessary condition
for the existence of degenerate band edge on the k − ω diagram can be written as
follows

m|| /∈ G.

(44)

None of the common periodic layered structures satisﬁes this criterion and,
therefore, none of them can develop the degenerate band edge. For example, even
if anisotropic layers are present, but the anisotropy axes in all anisotropic layers are
either aligned, or perpendicular to each other, the symmetry group G of the stack
still has the mirror plane m||, which guarantees the separation of the x- and the y -
polarizations and the reducibility of the respective transfer matrix TL to the block-
diagonal form (42). The only way to satisfy the condition (44) and, thereby, to allow
for degenerate band edge on the k − ω diagram, is to have at least two misaligned
anisotropic layers in a unit cell with the misalignment angle being diﬀerent from 0
and π/2, as shown in the example in Fig. 5.

Observe that the presence of B layers in the periodic array in Fig. 5 is also
essential, unless the two anisotropic layers A1 and A2 have diﬀerent thicknesses or are
made of diﬀerent anisotropic materials. In Fig. 5, the layers A1 and A2 diﬀer only
by their orientation in the x − y plane, but otherwise, they are identical. In such a
case, if the B layers are removed, the point symmetry group of the periodic stack in
Fig. 5 rises from D2 to D2h acquiring the glide mirror plane m||. This, according
to the criterion (44), imposes the reducibility of the matrix TL to the block-diagonal
form (42), regardless of the misalignment angle between the adjacent A layers. The
symmetry imposed reducibility rules out the possibility of the degenerate band edge
(6). The k − ω diagram of the periodic stack in Fig. 5 with the B layers removed is
shown in Fig. 6(d).

In the numerical example considered in the next section, the B layers are simply
empty gaps of certain thickness DB between the adjacent double layers A1 − A2. The
misalignment angle is chosen π/4. By changing the thickness DB of the gap B, one
can change the k − ω diagram of the periodic stack, as shown in Fig. 6. Similar eﬀect
can be achieved by changing the misalignment angle between the adjacent A layers.

3. Transmission resonance in the vicinity of degenerate band edge

3.1. Scattering problem for periodic semi-inﬁnite stack

To solve the scattering problem for a plane monochromatic wave incident on a ﬁnite
stack of anisotropic layers we use the following standard approach based on the 4 × 4
transfer matrix.

where D is the stack thickness. The ﬁeld inside the stack is denoted by ΨT (z). Except
for the stationary points (37) on the k − ω diagram, ΨT (z) can be decomposed into
a superposition of the four Bloch solutions (20) of the Maxwell equation (10)

ΨT (z) =

This representation is meaningful if the periodic stack contains a signiﬁcant number
of unit cells L. Otherwise, if there are just a few layers in the stack, the representation
(46) is formally valid, but not particularly useful.

The relation

Ψ (D) = TSΨ (0) ,

together with the pair of boundary conditions (47) allow to express both the
reﬂected wave ΨR and the wave ΨP passed through the slab, in terms of a given
incident wave ΨI and the elements of the transfer matrix TS. This also gives the
transmittance/reﬂectance coeﬃcients of the slab deﬁned as

where S = cW is the Poynting vector of the respective wave. In the case of a lossless
stack

τ D + ρD = 1.

The ﬁeld distribution ΨT (z) inside the slab is found using either of the following

expressions

ΨT (z) = T (z, 0) [ΨI (0) + ΨR (0)] = T (z, D) ΨP (D) , 0 ≤ z ≤ D.

(51)

The above procedure is commonly used for the frequency-domain analysis of
periodic and non-periodic layered structures involving anisotropic and/or gyrotropic
layers (see, for example, [10],[11],[12],[5],[13, 14, 15, 16] and references therein).

Gigantic transmission band edge resonance in periodic stacks of anisotropic layers 19

In addition to the ﬁeld distribution inside the slab, we are also interested in
its eigenmode composition. The latter is particularly important since it allows to
explain the fundamental diﬀerence between Fabry-Perot resonance in the vicinity of a
degenerate band edge and a similar resonance in the vicinity of a regular band edge.
Throughout this section we consider only the ﬁrst transmission resonance, closest to
the respective band edge.

3.2. Field composition at the frequency of transmission resonance

In the case of transmission resonance in a periodic stack of isotropic layers, the
resonance ﬁeld inside the stack is a simple standing wave composed of two propagating
Bloch modes with opposite group velocity (see Eqs. (1) through ((5) and the comments
therein). The introduction of anisotropy in itself does not change qualitatively
the resonance picture, as shown in Fig.
9. The only diﬀerence is that the
electromagnetic ﬁeld ΨT (z) inside the stack can now have both propagating and
evanescent components. But at the frequency of a transmission resonance, the
contribution of the evanescent components is negligible, as shown in Fig. 10. So,
basically, one can still see the resonance ﬁeld inside the stack as a simple standing
wave composed of a pair of propagating modes with greatly enhanced amplitude,
compared to that of the incident wave. The formulas (1) through ((5) still apply here,
provided that the number N of unit cells in the stack is not too small.

Now let us turn to the case of transmission resonance in the vicinity of degenerate
band edge d in Fig. 6(b). There are several features that sharply distinguish this case
from the similar transmission resonance near the regular band edge g in Fig. 6(a).

First of all, for a given number N of unit cells in the stack (N = 32), the ﬁeld
intensity in Fig. 8(b) is by several orders of magnitude higher, compared to that in
Fig. 9(b), in spite of the close similarity of all numerical parameters of the respective
periodic structures (see the Appendix). In the case of transmission resonance in the
vicinity of degenerate band edge (DBE), the resonance ﬁeld intensity increases as N 4,
while in the case of a regular band edge (BE), the ﬁeld intensity is proportional to

The second distinction is that in the case of degenerate band edge (DBE), the

ﬁeld intensity near the slab boundaries at z = 0 and z = D, increases as

DBE case:

|ΨT (z)|

∝ z4, (D − z)

.

By contrast, in the case of a regular band edge (BE), the ﬁeld intensity near the stack
boundaries rises at a much slower rate

∝ z2, (D − z)

which is characteristic of a regular standing wave composed of two propagating
components.

Finally, in the case of a regular band edge, the transmission resonance ﬁeld ΨT (z)
is a standing wave composed of two propagating Bloch modes with opposite group
velocities. The evanescent modes do not participate in the formation of the resonance
ﬁeld, as clearly seen in Fig. 10. By contrast, in the case of transmission resonance
in the vicinity of DBE, the role of evanescent components in the formation of the
resonance ﬁeld is absolutely crucial.
Indeed, as shown in Fig. 11, amplitude of
the propagating and evanescent components are comparable in magnitude. More
importantly, the combined contribution Ψpr (z) of the two propagating components
does not even resemble a standing wave with the nodes at the slab boundary, as was
the case in Fig. 10(b). Instead, comparing Fig. 8(b) and Fig. 11(b) we see that at
the slab boundaries at z = 0 and z = D. the propagating and evanescent components
interfere destructively, almost canceling each other

at z = 0 and z = D: Ψpr (z) ≈ −Ψev (z) ,

while the individual Bloch components (52) remain huge. We remind that in all cases,
the intensity of the incident wave ΨI is unity.

boundaries.

Qualitatively, such a bizarre resonance behavior in the vicinity of the degenerate
band edge can be characterized as follows. As we already mentioned, at the frequency
ωd of degenerate band edge, three of the four solutions for the Maxwell equation
(10) are non-Bloch eigenmodes diverging as z, z2, z3. Although the frequency ω1
of the transmission cavity resonance is slightly diﬀerent from ωd and, therefore, all
four eigenmodes are Bloch waves, the close proximity of ω1 to ωd causes all the
abnormalities seen in Fig. 10. To describe these behavior in mathematically consistent

Gigantic transmission band edge resonance in periodic stacks of anisotropic layers 22

way, one should start with the one solutions at ω = ωd as zero approximation. Then
using the perturbation theory for the non-diagonalizable transfer matrix TL (ωd), one
can derive an asymptotic theory for the case of large N . The perturbation theory
for the degenerate band edge d was developed in [17]. It turns out that near the slab
boundaries at z ≪ D and (D − z) ≪ D, the ﬁeld ΨT (z) at the transmission resonance
frequency ω1 is well approximated by quadratically diverging non-Bloch eigenmode,
corresponding to ω = ωd. It qualitatively explains an extremely rapid growth (55) of
the resonance ﬁeld inside the slab as one moves away from either slab boundary. It
also explains the sharp dependence (7) of the resonance ﬁeld intensity on the number
N of unit cells in the stack.

4. Appendix

4.1. Numerical parameters of layered arrays

The periodic array in Fig. 5. has three layers in a unit cell L, of which two (A1 and
A2) are anisotropic and have the same thickness DA. The third layer B is isotropic
with the thickness DB. In our numerical simulations, the B layers are empty gaps of
variable thickness.

The anisotropic layers A1 and A2 are made of the same lossless dielectric material

and have the same thickness. The respective dielectric permittivity tensor is

εA + δ cos 2ϕ
δ sin 2ϕ

δ sin 2ϕ
εA − δ cos 2ϕ



ˆε = 

where δ describes the magnitude of in-plane anisotropy, while the angle ϕ deﬁnes the
orientation of the anisotropy axes of the respective layer in the x − y plane. The most
critical parameter of the periodic structure in Fig. 5 is the misalignment angle

ϕ = ϕ1 − ϕ2

(57)

between the adjacent anisotropic layers A1 and A2. This angle determines the
symmetry of the periodic array and, eventually, what kind of k − ω diagram it can
display. It is important for our purposes that the misalignment angle is diﬀerent from
0 and π/2. In our numerical simulations we set

ϕ1 = 0, ϕ2 = π/4,

and use the following expressions for the dielectric permittivity of the A layers

ˆεA1 = 

In our numerical simulations we set

εA = 13. 61, δ = 12. 4.

The numerical value of εzz is irrelevant.

In the case of the periodic array of isotropic layers in Fig. 1(a), we set

εA = 3.78, δ = 0, DA = DB = 0.5 × L.

4.2. Description of plots

In all plots of the ﬁeld intensity distribution we, in fact, plotted the following physical
quantity

2
|Ψ (z)|

=

~E (z) · ~E∗ (z) + ~H (z) · ~H ∗ (z)

(59)

D

E

D

which is the squared ﬁeld amplitude averaged over local unit cell. The real
2
electromagnetic energy density W (z) is similar to |Ψ (z)|
. Both of them are strongly
oscillating functions of the coordinate z with the period of oscillations coinciding with
the unit cell length L. Thus, the quantity (59) can be interpreted as the smoothed
ﬁeld intensity distribution, with the correction coeﬃcient of the order of unity.

In all plots, the wave number k and the frequency ω are expressed in units of L−1

,

EL

and cL−1, respectively.

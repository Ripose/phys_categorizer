We report the observation of sum-frequency signals that depend linearly on an applied electrostatic
ﬁeld and that change sign with the handedness of an optically active solution. This recently predicted
chiral electro-optic eﬀect exists in the electric-dipole approximation. The static electric ﬁeld gives
rise to an electric-ﬁeld-induced sum-frequency signal (an achiral third-order process) that interferes
with the chirality-speciﬁc sum-frequency at second-order. The cross-terms linear in the electrostatic
ﬁeld constitute the eﬀect and may be used to determine the absolute sign of second- and third-order
nonlinear optical susceptibilities in isotropic media.

Most biological molecules are chiral [1], i.e. have a non-
superimposable mirror image. In many respects the two
mirror image forms (enantiomers) of a chiral molecule
have identical physical properties. Optical activity is
often the only practical means to distinguish between
enantiomers in solution. Conventional optical activity
phenomena, such as optical rotation and circular dichro-
ism, are based on the interference of induced oscillat-
ing electric- and magnetic (and electric-quadrupole) mo-
ments, and arise from a diﬀerential response to left and
right circularly polarized light [2].

Remarkably, a purely electric-dipolar nonlinear-optical
process can also be a probe of chirality [3]. Two op-
tical ﬁelds of diﬀerent frequency can coherently mix in
an isotropic medium to generate light at their sum (or
diﬀerence) frequency if the medium is optically active,
i.e. a non-racemic solution of chiral molecules [3]. The
It
signal itself is then a probe of molecular chirality:
is the intrinsic broken symmetry of the chiral molecules
that causes a non-racemic liquid to be noncentrosymmet-
ric and hence allows for an electric-dipolar second-order
nonlinear optical process in an isotropic medium.

The sum-frequency intensity is in general, however,
not sensitive to the sign of the underlying property ten-
sor, and thus does not readily distinguish between enan-

a recently predicted chiral electro-optic eﬀect [4] that
arises when a static electric ﬁeld is applied to coher-
ent sum- or diﬀerence-frequency generation in an op-
tically active liquid. The static ﬁeld does not change
the phase matching conditions, but it gives rise to an
electric-ﬁeld-induced contribution to the signal. The beat
between chirality-sensitive sum-frequency generation (a
second-order process) and achiral electric-ﬁeld-induced
sum-frequency generation (a third order process) yields
a contribution to the intensity that is linear in the static
electric ﬁeld and that changes sign with the enantiomer
[4, 5]. The eﬀect can give the absolute sign of the

isotropic part of the sum-frequency hyperpolarizability
(if the sign of the achiral third-order property is known)
and hence makes it possible to determine the handed-
ness of chiral molecules in solution via an electric-dipolar
optical process.

Sum-frequency generation (SFG) from chiral liquids
has recently been re-examined [6] and has been observed
experimentally [7, 8, 9]. The molecular response to two
optical ﬁelds Eβ (ω1) and Eγ(ω2) (and a static ﬁeld Eδ(0))
at the sum-frequency ω3 = ω1 + ω2 can be written in
terms of an induced oscillating dipole moment

µα(ω3) =

where βαβγ and γαβγδ are the ﬁrst and second hyper-
polarizability respectively. The macroscopic response is
given by an appropriate spatial average. Here we con-
sider an isotropic medium in the presence of a static elec-
tric ﬁeld Eδ(0). A Boltzmann average yields the induced
macroscopic polarization at the sum-frequency [4, 5]:

where ǫαβγ is the Levi-Civita tensor and δαβ the Kro-

antisymmetric chirally sensitive isotropic component of
the second-order susceptibility, and χ(3)
i with i =1, 2 or
3 are the achiral isotropic components of the third-order
susceptibility. The intensity at the sum-frequency is pro-
portional to |Pα(ω3)|2 and so contains – besides a con-
tribution independent of the static ﬁeld, and one that is

quadratic in the static ﬁeld – cross terms that are linear
in the static ﬁeld and linear in χ(2):

where I are the respective incident intensities, Re is the

have denoted the contribution to the intensity at the sum-

ﬁrst hyperpolarizability and is given by

χ(2) =

where N is the excess number density. It is seen that χ(2)
vanishes for any molecule that possesses a mirror plane, a
center of inversion, or a rotation-reﬂection axis; thus χ(2)
is only non-zero for chiral systems and changes sign as the
handedness of the optically active liquid changes. The
contribution to the intensity linear in E(0) may there-
fore reveal the sign of the pseudoscalar χ(2). It can be
used to determine the absolute conﬁguration of the chiral
molecules in the optically active liquid.

Should the duration of the static applied ﬁeld be longer
than the rotational time of the molecules in solution, then
there are additional temperature-dependent terms of the
form βααβ(ω3 = ω1 + ω2) µ(0)
β /(kT ) for molecules with
a permanent dipole moment µ(0)
[4]. At ambient con-

ditions, the temperature dependent contributions may
dominate for dipolar molecules and be of either sign.
Both γααββ and βααβ µ(0)

symmetry operation and so it follows that the χ(3)
ex-
ist for achiral molecules (e.g. an achiral solvent) and
are necessarily the same for both enantiomers of a chiral
molecule.

We observe the chiral electro-optic eﬀect in an experi-
mental arrangement schematically depicted in Figure 1a.
From the antisymmetry of the Levi-Civita tensor in Eqn.
(2) it follows that the optical ﬁelds need to have compo-
nents that are mutually orthogonal such that they span
the x, y, and z axes of a Cartesian frame. Hence, sum-
frequency generation from isotropic media requires that
one optical ﬁeld be S-polarized and the remaining two be
P-polarized. Further, the static electric ﬁeld has to be

2

We use the 775-nm fundamental wavelength of a
Ti:sapphire regenerative ampliﬁer (Clark-MXR CPA-
2010) along with its second harmonic at 338 nm to gener-
ate sum-frequency signals at 258 nm. The pulse duration
is ∼150 fs and the repetition rate is 1 kHz. A custom-
built high voltage power supply provides 3.5 to 10 kV
peak to peak modulated at 500 Hz. The modulation of
the applied electric ﬁeld permits phase sensitive detec-
tion.

Unlike

in collinear

electric-ﬁeld-induced second-
harmonic generation (EFISH) [10], the non-collinear SFG
beam geometry [6] allows the use of fully immersed elec-
trodes. These are suspended in a standard quartz optical
cuvette and spaced ∼2 mm apart.

We observe the chiral electro-optic eﬀect in optically
active solutions prepared from R-(+)- or S-(−)-1, 1′-bi-2-
naphthol (R-BN and S-BN) (see Figure 1b) which are dis-
solved in the achiral solvent tetrahydrofuran (THF). In
Figure 2 we show that the signals are of opposite sign for
the R- and S-enantiomers of BN and that they vary lin-
early with the strength of the applied low-frequency ﬁeld.
The small diﬀerence in absolute strength of the respective
signals is attributed to small diﬀerences in the electrode-
spacings and/or the concentrations. The SFG(E) signals
change sign as the direction of the static ﬁeld is reversed.
For ﬁxed beam polarizations, direction and strength of
the static ﬁeld, we also observe a linear dependence of the
chiral electro-optic eﬀect on the enantiomeric concentra-
tion diﬀerence of the optically active solution, as is seen
in Figure 3. Starting with a 0.56 M solution of R-(+)-
1, 1′-bi-2-naphthol in THF, the handedness of the 0.56
M solution is gradually changed by the addition of a so-
lution of S-(−)-1, 1′-bi-2-naphthol in THF. The SFG(E)

racemic mixture.

To describe the polarization dependence of the sum-
frequency signals, we now consider the axis system and
beam geometry depicted in Figure 1a. For simplicity we
ignore the small rotation of the plane of polarization in
the chiral liquid due to optical activity (< 0.5◦), and we
note that a static electric ﬁeld can not contribute linearly
to optical rotation in a ﬂuid.

From Eqn. (2) and the requirement for a transverse
wave at the sum-frequency, it follows that a PPS combi-
nation of polarizations (listed throughout this Letter in
the order of the optical ﬁelds at: ω3, ω1, ω2) gives rise to
an SFG(E) signal of the form

Since χ(3)
are the same for the R- and S-enantiomers
while the χ(2) change sign, solutions of R- and S-BN with
equal concentration will have equal but opposite SFG(E)
intensities in the same ﬁeld Ex(0), and this can be seen in
Figure 4. Further, the change of sign in going from PPS
to SPP polarizations and similarly from SPP to PSP sug-
gests that χ(3)
3 have the same sign for BN
(2(θ1 + θ2) < π). The three polarization states PPS, PSP
and SPP permit the observation of the three isotropic
third-order susceptibilities, χ(3)
. For a static ﬁeld of ∼2.5
i
kV/cm the SFG(E) signals are, depending on beam po-
larizations, ∼5 to 20% of the SFG signals in the absence
of a dc electric ﬁeld shown in Figure 5. Nonlinear optical
susceptibilities of diﬀerent order may thus be measured
under identical optical ﬁeld conditions without the need
for an external reference, as the χ(2) will act as an in-
ternal standard. The relative strength of χ(3)
and
χ(3)
3 may in turn yield information about speciﬁc hyper-
polarizability tensor components entering the third-order
susceptibility. Such an analysis is, however, chromophore
speciﬁc and will not be discussed further here. Finally,
Figure 5 conﬁrms that SFG signals independent of E do
not distinguish between enantiomers.

For a dc electric ﬁeld along +x (see Fig 1a) we measure
a positive SFG(E)PSP intensity for S-BN. In the case of
the resonant signals from R- and S-BN, where the com-
plex nature of the response tensors needs to be consid-
ered, and in the absence of any measurable χ(3)
contri-
bution from the achiral solvent, the determination of the
absolute conﬁguration of the chiral molecules will require
quantum chemical computations for both χ(2) and χ(3)
.
However, the contribution from an achiral solvent should
make it possible to determine the absolute sign of both
the second- and third-order susceptibilities for both op-
tical isomers of a chiral molecule [4].

In summary, we have observed the linear eﬀect of a
static electric ﬁeld on the sum-frequency generation in-
tensity from optically active liquids. The reported chiral
electro-optic eﬀect arises in the electric-dipole approxi-
mation and changes sign with the enantiomer and upon
reversing the direction of the static electric ﬁeld. The
eﬀect may be used to determine the absolute sign of the
second-order and third-order nonlinear optical suscepti-
bilities.

Should the achiral solvent give rise to an appreciable
electric-ﬁeld-induced sum-frequency signal, then the ef-

3

fect could be used to amplify weak sum-frequency signals
from chiral solutions.

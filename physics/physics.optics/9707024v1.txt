We study the electromagnetic scattering by multilayered
biperiodic aggregates of dielectric layers and gratings of con-
ducting plates. We show that the characteristic lengths of
such structures provide a good control of absorption bands.
The inﬂuence of the physical parameters of the problem (sizes,
impedances) is discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Electromagnetic absorbers and frequency selective sur-
faces (FFS for short) have recently received an increasing
interest. There is a growing need for electromagnetic ab-
sorbers, and in particular for lighter, thinner and more
highly absorbing materials. Frequency selective surfaces
are generally made of planar screens with periodic or
biperiodic metallizations. One generally considers two
types of FFS: capacitive FFS are transparent at low fre-
quencies; inductive FFS are reﬂecting ones. Their behav-
ior at the resonance frequency is complementary. Capac-
itive FFS consist of arrays of metal patches embedded
in a dielectric structure, which may be a stratiﬁed one.
The dielectric structure provides the mechanical support
of the FFS. Inductive FFS consist of perforated screens.
Such frequency selective surfaces have been considered
by several authors [1,6,13] who have proposed various ap-
proaches for the numerical resolution of the correspond-
ing scattering problem. Eﬃcient numerical methods are
now available for the analysis and design of FFS, as we
shall show.

The purpose of this paper is to show that the ab-
sorption bands of such structures may be controlled by
combining the performances of capacitive FFS and elec-
tromagnetic absorbers. To vary the frequency response
of a FFS, the standard method consists in varying the
geometry of the array elements. We give eﬃcient com-
putational methods for analyzing this kind of structure.
The representation of the transmitted and reﬂected ﬁelds
is obtained by applying resistive boundary conditions to
include a general surface impedance in the problem for-
mulation.

We provide examples of such periodic or biperiodic
structures, whose absorption bands can easily be con-
trolled by varying some of the characteristic lengths of
the system. More precisely, we consider multilayers made
of dielectric stacks and surface gratings with various
shapes and sizes. We show that such structures yield
absorption bands, and that the location and bandwidth
of such bands may be controlled by varying the charac-
teristic sizes of the structure.

This paper is organized as follows. After this introduc-
tion, we describe in Section II the details of the diﬀract-
ing structures we consider, and the model we use to
solve numerically the corresponding diﬀraction problem.
Then we develop in section III the numerical resolution
method, and discuss a series of examples. Finally, sec-
tion IV is devoted to the conclusions. More technical as-
pects concerning the mathematical background and nu-
merical details are discussed in three appendices at the
end of this paper.

II. MODELLING THE BIPERIODIC
STRUCTURES

We consider a system made of dielectric layers and
biperiodic gratings of resistive conducting plates, ended
by an inﬁnitely conducting plane (or the vacuum), lo-
cated at a height z = 0. The structure is globally in-
variant under the discrete translations of period (a, b)
which deﬁne the grating, namely translations of the form
x
ZZ, in the xOy plane.
The structure is illuminated by an incident monochro-
matic ﬁeld of the form

The geometry of the problem is displayed in Fig 1. We
shall generically denote by E(j) and H (j) the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds in the j-th layer zj < z < zj+1, with
electric permittivity ǫj; we shall also use the superscript
+ or
, according to whether the ﬁeld propagates in the
direction of positive or negative z. From now on, the
conﬁguration of Fig. 1 will be refered to as conﬁguration
I.

fectly conducting plane. The incident ﬁeld propagates in the
direction of negative z.

Alternatively, we shall also consider the same struc-
ture, but we remove the inﬁnitely conducting plane at
z = 0. The latter conﬁguration will be called conﬁgura-
tion II.

A. Floquet Modes

Taking into account the global invariance of the prob-
lem, it is natural to introduce the associated Floquet
decompositions. Let −→k = (kx, ky, kz) be the incident
wavevector. In a medium of permittivity ǫ, let us set for
all integers m, n

which form an orthonormal basis of the space of biperi-

well known that such function satisfy Helmholtz’s equa-
tion, and that both the electric and the magnetic ﬁelds
may be decomposed into those Floquet modes (see e.g.
[11]). Therefore, we write in the j-th layer

FIG. 2. The grating of conducting plates, in the particular

case of rectangular plates.

Several approaches have been proposed for imposing
boundary conditions. Among these, the integral formu-
lations (e.g. Galerkin methods) are generally considered
the most stable. To implement the Galerkin method, we
need to introduce a family of functions deﬁned on the
plates. Let −→ψ pq(x, y) be such a family. If zP denotes the
height of the interface supporting the conducting plates,
we then write, at a height z = zP

(x, y) =

−→

p,q

(17)

The boundary conditions rely on three sets of equa-
tions. First, the continuity of the tangential electric ﬁelds
at all interfaces

(x, y, zj) = −→E

(x, y, zj) ,

(18)

(x, y, zP ) ,

(21)

(where −→
vanishes outside the conducting plates) require
J
a special treatment. It has been observed by several au-
thors that such conditions cannot be imposed pointwise,
because this leads to unstable systems. Several alter-
natives have been proposed and tested (see for example
[6]). The most stable solutions rely on the use of in-
tegral formulations, obtained by considering either line
integrals of the above equation, or a Galerkin formula-
tion. We limit ourselves to the latter, which leads to a
ﬁnite number of integral equations, obtained by testing
Eq. (21) against suitably chosen basis functions ψpq(x, y)
(see Appendix A for some possible choices).

C. The Coupled System

Let us start with the case of conﬁguration I. Taking
into account the above remarks, we are led to the fol-
I
lowing formulation. We denote by −→E
the in-
cident and reﬂected electric ﬁelds respectively, and we
recall that we have denoted by P the index of the in-
terface containing the plates. In order to avoid as much
as possible numerical problems, we limit ourselves to a
formulation involving the so-called R-matrix propagation
formalism [4,5] (see Appendix B for a short account of
the method).

Using the R-matrix propagation scheme, we can obtain
R matrices for the stacks below and above z = zP . For

The remarkable point with such a formulation is that
it only involves small matrices, since modes with diﬀer-
ent indices m, n are not coupled. The only place where
coupling between Floquet modes occurs is at a height
z = zP .

The case of conﬁguration II requires only minor mod-
iﬁcations. Eq. (22) is still valid. For the stack below the
grating of conducting plates, we have to replace Eq. (23)

B. Numerical Results

Our main goal is to exhibit absorption bands, and to
analyze the inﬂuence of some speciﬁc parameters on the
location of the maximal absorption. More precisely, we
focus on the inﬂuence of the resistive impedance Z and
the ratio size of resistive plates/period. In addition, we
show that the location of the absorption band essentially
does not depend on the incidence angle. We work with a
TM polarization for the incident ﬁeld (in fact the results
are weakly dependent on the polarization).

We consider a series of conﬁgurations, in which we vary
individually these parameters, in the frequency domain
1GHz
10GHz. In all the ﬁgures, we plot the reﬂectivity
−
the ratio of reﬂected ﬂux by incident ﬂux) as a
(i.e.
function of the incident frequency, and in the case of
conﬁguration II we also plot the transmittivity (i.e. the
ratio of transmitted ﬂux by incident ﬂux).

4

We start with the case of square resistive plates of side-
length a′, with variable impedance. The period of the
grating is set to a = 10mm in both the x and y directions.
The grating is supported by a dielectric stack of height
z = 4mm and complex refractive index ǫ = 10 + 2i, it-
self supported by an inﬁnitely conducting plane (a simple
case of conﬁguration I). Since the resistive plates are in
that case square plates, we use Fourier-type decomposi-
tions as described in Appendix A 1 for the decomposition
of the surface current. The numerical results displayed
below have been obtained using 17
17 Floquet modes
and the same number of Galerkin modes.

×

Square plates

ing capacitive grating (with an important ratio a′/a) can
absorb an incident plane wave in totality. Thanks to this
absorption by a leaky surface wave propagating along the
grating, we can control the absorption band of a classical
Dahlenbach absorber layer which consists of a thick ho-
mogeneous lossy layer backed by a metallic plate. When
the ratio a′/a tends to zero we have checked that the min-
imum of reﬂectivity is obtained for the same frequency
as in Figure 3. To adjust the absorption band of the ab-
sorber, we can deposit a biperiodic capacitive reﬂecting
grating on the Dahlenbach layer. By doing so, we com-
bine the properties of the biperiodic grating with those
of the lossy layer. Notice in particular that it is possi-
ble to decrease the thickness of the layer by adding such
a biperiodic structure, to obtain the critical absorption
frequency of the initial Dahlenbach structure.

plate’s size: a′ = 1, 2, 4, 7, 9mm. The period a is kept ﬁxed
to a = 10mm. θ = 0 and Z = 0.

We show in Figure 3 the reﬂectivity as a function of
the incident frequency, for several values of the ratio a′/a.
The computed values are indicated with symbols, and in-
termediate values have been obtained using cubic spline
interpolation. In all cases, a signiﬁcant absorption band
is observed. In addition, the critical frequency (i.e. the
frequency at which reﬂectivity attains its minimum) de-
creases as the ratio a′/a increases, and the width of the
absorption band narrows.

In the considered case, the plates are perfectly con-
ducting. We nevertheless observe a strong absorption in
a speciﬁc frequency range. Such a phenomenon is gener-
ally coupled with the excitation of a leaky surface wave.
The surface wave may be given an interpretation in terms
of complex poles or zeroes of a scattering matrix (see [8]
for details on the scattering matrix, and [9] for an anal-
ysis of the role of zeroes and poles). The poles of the
scattering matrix give the propagation constant of the
leaky waves, which propagate along the surface of the
biperiodic grating. The leaky wave is evanescent, as its
energy decreases in the direction normal to the surface of
the structure. The imaginary part of the pole gives the
damping of the wave. The excitation of a leaky wave is
a resonance phenomenon at a particular frequency. Fig-
ure 3 shows a spectacular phenomenon. A highly reﬂect-

FIG. 4. Square plates in conﬁguration I. Reﬂectivity as a

plate’s impedance: Z = 10, 30, 100Ω/✷. The period a and
the plate’s size a′ are kept ﬁxed a = 10mm and a′ = 7mm.
θ = 0.

We show in Figure 4 the reﬂectivity as a function of
the frequency of the incident beam, for several values of
the impedance Z. The conﬁguration corresponds to the
case of Fig. 3 with a′ = 7mm, and a signiﬁcant minimum
in the reﬂectivity is observed for a certain value of the
frequency. This critical value is seen to be an increasing
function of the impedance of the conducting plates.

In Figure 4, the patches of the grating are not perfectly
conducting any more. In that case, the absorption fre-
quency and the bandwidth increase with the resistivity of
the patches. To obtain a required absorption band, it is
therefore possible to combine the eﬀects of the geometry
(here the ratio a′/a) and the eﬀect of the conductivity.
This provides extra ﬂexibility to the ﬁlter design.

We show in Figure 5 the reﬂectivity as a function of the
frequency of the incident beam, for several values of the
incidence angle θ, for the same conﬁguration as before,
i.e. a conﬁguration exhibiting a well deﬁned absorption
band. These results (and other tests of intermediate in-
cidence angles, are not reproduced here to simplify the
plot) show that the critical frequency value depends very
weakly on the incidence angle (at least for angles smaller
than 45 deg).

The same computations have been performed with re-
sistive plates of various shapes. We display here the re-
sults obtained when the square resistive plates in Fig. 3
are replaced with cross-shaped ones, of the same size. By
this we mean that the crosses lie within a square of the
sidelength a′, and are made of ﬁve identical squares of
sidelength a′/3. For this case, we used the surface ele-
ments described in Appendix A 2, and as before we take
17 Floquet modes, and the same number of Galerkin
17
×
modes.

The numerical results, displayed in Figures 6 and 7
show a similar behavior to the previous case: a well de-
ﬁned absorption band is clearly seen, and the critical
frequency again depends on the ratio a′/a and on the
impedance Z. Again, the location of the absorption band
depends only weakly on the incidence angle (the numer-
ical results, not given here, are very similar to those dis-
played in Fig. 5). The only signiﬁcant diﬀerence which
may be observed is a broadening of the absorption band
in the case of cross-shaped plates, and a second minimum
occurs for large a′.

θ = 0.

Similar computations have been made with conﬁgura-
tion II. We display in Fig. 8 (reﬂexion) and Fig. 9 (trans-
mission) the results obtained with systems identical to
those considered in Figures 3-5. We observe that in such
a conﬁguration, the reﬂexion is small and almost constant
above 5Ghz, it increases slightly with a′. The transmit-
tivity shows maximums at frequencies corresponding to
the minimums in conﬁguration I.

These two ﬁgures show the importance of the conduct-
ing plane at z = 0. The well-deﬁned absorption band
appears only in that case. The excitation of the leaky
wave and the corresponding absorption occurs only for
structures ended by a conducting plane.

Next, we consider a second system (in conﬁguration I),
in which the resistive plates are located upon a double
layer of dielectrics. The ﬁrst dielectric (upon which the
plates are located) has electric permittivity ǫ = 5, and
the second layer has electric permittivity ǫ = 15 + i18σ/ν
with a frequency dependent imaginary part. Here the
constant σ is set to σ = 10s/m, and the frequency ν is
expressed in GHz.

The results are displayed in Figures 10 and 11. As be-
fore, an absorption band is clearly seen on Figure 10,
when a′
is above 4mm, whose critical frequency and
bandwidth decrease as the sidelength of the plates in-
creases. In addition, for small plates, the reﬂectivity has
a constant behavior close to zero above 8GHz. Figure 11
shows that in such a conﬁguration, the critical frequency
depends weakly on the value of the impedance, but the
bandwidth is an increasing function of the impedance.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

We have studied and described a series of conﬁgura-
tions involving dielectric stacks and arrays or resistive
plates which produce well-deﬁned absorption bands, with
controllable absorption frequency. The critical frequency
has been shown to be strongly inﬂuenced by the ratio
period/plate-size, which therefore provides a good con-
trol parameter. The impedance of the resistive plates has
been shown to allow the control of the critical frequency.
Our approach is based on a Floquet (or Rayleigh) de-
velopment of the electromagnetic ﬁelds within the diﬀer-
ent layers of the structure, and a Galerkin approximation
of the surface currents. Multilayers more complex than
the ones we considered here may be described by the
formalism of this paper as well.

In light of the numerical experiments we have per-
formed, it is possible to combine the diﬀerent parameters
(namely the ratio a′/a, the geometry of the patches and
the conductivity of the patch material) to obtain opti-
mized absorbing structures from a quite standard biperi-
odic grating. The use of absorption by a leaky surface
wave can improve a classical Dahlenbach structure.

APPENDIX A: THE SURFACE ELEMENTS

Depending on the geometry of the conducting plates,
several diﬀerent bases of surface elements may be used.
In all cases, the ﬁnite number of basis functions we are
forced to consider limits the precision of the approxima-
tion of the current.

1. Rectangular Plates

+

pq (x, y) =

2 a′] cos
2 a′] sin

To start with, we consider the case of rectangular
plates, as shown in Fig. 2 above. In such cases, the best
choice for surface elements is provided by a Fourier basis:
we set
~ψT E

pπ
a′ [x + 1
pπ
a′ [x + 1
pπ
a′ [x + 1
pπ
a′ [x + 1
Therefore, the Floquet modes of the surface current may
be written as

may be computed analytically.

For other special geometries, such as disks or elongated
disks, it is possible to design appropriate basis functions
to describe the current density on the resistive plates (in
the case of disks, such basis functions are linear combi-
nations of Bessel functions). However, it is also desirable
to have basis functions which can describe arbitrary ge-
ometries. This is the purpose of the surface elements
described in the next subsection.

2. Arbitrary Plates

For conducting plates with arbitrary geometry, we are
forced to use “all purpose” basis functions, which we shall
call surface elements. Such basis functions have been
considered by several authors under the name of rooftop
functions. It follows from the analysis in [6] that rooftop
functions often provide faster and better conditioned nu-
merical schemes than classical alternatives (the so-called
surface-patch and triangular patch functions). The ﬁrst
step for the construction of such surface elements is a
discretization of the plate. For the sake of simplicity, we
restrict to a uniform square discretization, with period τ .
Consider the characteristic function

The surface elements we consider will be those functions
pq(x, y) and ψy
ψx
pq(x, y) such that their support is com-
pletely included in the support of the plate. Clearly, the
smaller τ the better is the approximation of the current,
but the higher the complexity of the numerical problem.

APPENDIX B: R-MATRIX PROPAGATION

We describe brieﬂy the R-matrix propagation scheme
as we used it in our simulations. Clearly, the simplest
approach amounts to consider the direct product of the
C matrices given in Eq. (11), which yields directly a C
matrix for the whole structure. As stressed by various
authors, such a scheme turns out to become rapidly un-
stable as the depth of the structure grows.

The above equations provide a simple iterative algorithm
for computing the global R-matrix for the stacks [zP , zF ]
and [z0, zP ]. This algorithm is known as the R-matrix
propagation algorithm, and has been analyzed by various
authors. We refer to [4,5,7,10] for more details.

We give here more details on the numerical methods
used to solve the complete problem. As stressed before,

most of the matrices used in the scheme are 2
2 ma-
trices, which are easy to handle. In addition, the use of
R-matrix propagation algorithm prevents us from devel-
oping numerical instabilities when computing products
of such matrices.

×

The main part of CPU is used for solving Eq. (36). Sev-
eral methods have been tested for that problem (which
has also been studied by various authors). The numer-
ical results presented here have been obtained by using
an inversion method based on LU -decomposition, with
left and rigth equilibrations of the matrix. A fortran im-
plementation of such a method is available in the LA-
PACK library (see [3]). Alternative methods may be
found in the literature, such as (complex) biconjugate
gradient methods or FFT-based methods.

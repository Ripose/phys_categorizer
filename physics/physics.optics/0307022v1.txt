phase conjugation. The pair of ﬁber lines and the optical signals in them may be either mirror-
symmetric or translationally symmetric about the conjugator.

The growing demand of higher capacity over longer transmission distances has seen ﬁber nonlinearity as a
major limiting factor in modern optical transmission systems [1, 2]. Among the methods under investigation,
nonlinearity compensation using optical phase conjugation (OPC) has emerged as an eﬀective means of
suppressing the nonlinear impairments [3, 4, 5]. This paper shall discuss two types of ﬁber arrangement with
respect to the OPC, as shown in Fig.1. In one type of arrangement, the ﬁber parameters and the signal
intensity are in scaled mirror symmetry about the OPC. While the other type is characterized by scaled
translational symmetry.

A mirror-symmetric link may consist of a ﬁber line on the left stretching from z = −L/R to z = 0, L > 0,

∀z ∈ [0, L/R], C 6= 0 being a constant, and the envelope functions are related as An(−z, t) = CA′∗
−n(Rz, t),
∀n ∈ Z. Physically, it says that the two ﬁber lines compensate each other for dispersion and nonlinearity.
Optical signals An(−L/R, t), n ∈ Z, entering the ﬁrst ﬁber line may be dispersed and nonlinearly distorted
to become An(0, t), n ∈ Z, which are converted into A′
−n(0, t)/C∗, n ∈ Z, by the OPC. The
second ﬁber line will then propagate the optical signals in a reversed manner with respect to the ﬁrst. The
−n(−L/R, t)/C∗, n ∈ Z, are exact replicas of the initial signals up to
ﬁnal outputs signals A′
complex conjugation. It is noted that parts of one ﬁber line would amplify light in correspondence to the
attenuation in parts of the other, and vice versa. A specialty ﬁber may be chosen with parameters satisfying
equations (3,5,6) to be the scaled mirror image of a transmission ﬁber which usually attenuates light. At the
same time, erbium doping or Raman pumping should be employed to obtain the gain speciﬁed by (4).

A link with translational symmetry could be constructed to cancel weak nonlinearities up to the ﬁrst order
perturbation. Consider two ﬁber lines with opposite Kerr and Raman nonlinear coeﬃcients but identical
linear parameters. If (1) with z ∈ [−L, 0] describe the signal propagation in one ﬁber line, then the signal
dynamics in the other would be governed by similar equations with negative γ and g coeﬃcients,

which take the input Bn(0, t), n ∈ Z and give the output Bn(L, t), n ∈ Z. When the signal intensity is not
very high, so that the nonlinearity is weak and treated with perturbation theory, the output from each ﬁber
line is a linearly dispersed version of the input, plus nonlinear distortions expanded in power series of the
γ and g coeﬃcients. By neglecting the higher order powers and keeping only the terms linear in γ or g, it
can be seen that the two ﬁber lines induce opposite nonlinear distortions to otherwise the same, linearly
dispersed signals. If the overall dispersion of each line is compensated to zero and the signal loss is made
up by a linear optical ampliﬁer, then the two lines in cascade would comprise a transmission line with ﬁber
nonlinearity annihilated up to the ﬁrst order perturbation. The problem is that an optical ﬁber with negative
nonlinear coeﬃcients does not exist naturally. Fortunately, it can be simulated by a regular ﬁber with the
help of OPC. Take a regular ﬁber with parameters (q, α′, γ′, g′) that satisfy,

ﬁctitious ﬁber with negative nonlinearity. The OPC at the output end of the regular ﬁber may be omitted
in practice, as most applications would not diﬀerentiate between a signal and its conjugate.

It is noted that each ﬁber line on one side of the OPC is not necessarily one ﬁber span, and the signal
intensity does not have to evolve monotonically either. Both methods work ﬁne when each side of the OPC
consists of multiple ﬁber spans with optical ampliﬁers boosting the signal power, although the added noise

makes perfect nonlinearity compensation impossible. Using a commercial software, computer simulations
have been carried out to test the proposed methods of nonlinearity compensation. For the mirror setup,
the test link consists of a specialty ﬁber, an OPC, and a transmission ﬁber 200 km long, with loss α = 0.2
dB/km, dispersion D = −8 ps/nm/km, dispersion slope S = 0.08 ps/nm2/km, eﬀective mode area Aeﬀ = 50
µm2, Kerr and Raman coeﬃcients that are typical of silica glass. The specialty ﬁber is made of the same
material, but with parameters (α′, D′, S′) = 20 × (−α, D, −S) and A′
eﬀ = 12.5 µm2. The nonlinearity of the
specialty ﬁber can be switched on and oﬀ. Ampliﬁer noise is added at the two ends of the link. The input are
four WDM channels spaced by 100 GHz, return-to-zero modulated at 10 Gb/s with 33% duty. The pulses
peak at 100 mW when entering the transmission ﬁber. For a WDM system with the span loss so large and
the input optical power so high, the output signals would be distorted heavily and become unusable, were
there no nonlinearity compensation [8]. By contrast, the transmission system becomes virtually penalty-
free with our scheme of mirror-symmetric nonlinearity compensation [8]. The test system in translational
symmetry is constructed with ten 100-km spans on one side of the OPC using the same transmission ﬁber as
in the mirror setup. Each span is ended by an erbium-doped ﬁber ampliﬁer (EDFA) with 20 dB gain, noise
ﬁgure 4 dB, and a dispersion compensating module (DCM) with negligible nonlinearity. The DCM perfectly
compensates the D and S of the ﬁber span. On the other side of the OPC are ten spans of transmission
eﬀ , γ′, g′) = (α, −D, S, Aeﬀ , γ, g). The loss and dispersion of each span are
ﬁber with parameters (α′, D′, S′, A′
also fully compensated by an EDFA and a DCM. The EDFA noise ﬁgure is still 4 dB. The input RZ pulses
peak at 10 mW when entering the transmission ﬁber. Firstly, the OPC is absent and the transmission result
of the 20-span link is shown in the left-side graph of Fig.2. When the OPC is put back, the other graph in
Fig.2 clearly demonstrates the eﬀect of nonlinearity compensation.

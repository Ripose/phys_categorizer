Optical trapping is a widely used technique, with many important applications in biology and metrology.
Complete modelling of trapping requires calculation of optical forces, primarily a scattering problem, and non-
optical forces. The T-matrix method is used to calculate forces acting on spheroidal and cylindrical particles.

1. Introduction

Optical

trapping provide three-dimensional
conﬁnement and manipulation of microscopic
particles by a focussed laser beam. Optical trap-
ping is a powerful and widespread technique, with
the single-beam gradient trap (also known as op-
tical tweezers) in use for a large number of bio-
logical and other applications.

The trapping beam applies optical forces (usu-
ally divided into a gradient force, acting towards
areas of higher irradiance, and scattering forces,

including absorption and reﬂection forces) to the
particle.

The optical forces and torques result from the
transfer of momentum and angular momentum
from the trapping beam to the particle. Various
approximate methods such as geometric optics or
Rayleigh approximations are often used for the
calculation of the optical forces. Such approx-
imate methods are not necessary, since electro-
magnetic scattering theory can be used for the
calculation of forces, avoiding the limited ranges
of applicability of the approximate methods.

Other forces will also aﬀect the motion of the
particle. The most important of these forces,
gravity, bouyancy, and viscous drag as the parti-
cle moves through the surrounding ﬂuid, are read-
ily taken into account.

2. Trapping as a scattering problem

The optical forces and torques applied to the
particle result from the transfer of momentum
and angular momentum from the trapping beam
to the particle. The total momentum transfer
can be found by solving the electromagnetic scat-
tering problem. A variety of numerical meth-
ods can be used – ﬁnite element method, FDTD,
discrete dipole approximation [1], the T-matrix
method [2,3], etc.

A number of these have been used for opti-
cal force calculations, including forces in optical
traps [4,5]. One method, however, stands out

as ideal for trapping force calculations – the T-
matrix method. The T-matrix method can be
considered an extension of Mie theory to arbitrar-
ily shaped particles with arbitrary illumination.
The main advantage of the T-matrix method
is that trapping calculations usually involve re-
peated calculation of the scattering for the same
particle under diﬀering illumination. In this case,
the T-matrix need only be calculated once, since
it is independent of the ﬁelds, whereas methods
such as FEM, FDTD and DDA will require the
entire calculation to be repeated.

In the T-matrix method, the incident trapping
ﬁeld illuminating the particle is expressed as a
sum of regular vector spherical wave functions
(VSWFs):

From the linearity of the Maxwell equations,
there is a linear relationship between the incident
and scattered ﬁelds:

pmn =

mnm′n′ am′n′ + T (12)

Xm′n′

qmn =

mnm′n′am′n′ + T (22)

mnm′n′bm′n′

(10)

The T-matrix can be calculated using the ex-
tended boundary condition method (EBCM) [2,
3]. For spherical particles, the T-matrix becomes
diagonal, and the non-zero elements are the usual
Mie coeﬃcients. For rotationally symmetric par-
ticles, the T-matrix is diagonal with respect to n.
Computer codes to calculate T-matrices for such
rotationally symmetric particles are available [6].

3. Representation of the trapping beam

The use of the T-matrix method for scatter-
ing calculations requires that the trapping beam
be represented in terms of vector spherical wave
functions, that is, the coeﬃcients amn and bmn
in equation (1) need to be found. The regular
VSWFs RgMmn and RgNmn provide a com-
plete set of modes or partial waves, each indi-
vidually satisfying the Maxwell equations, which
can be used to represent any incident electromag-
netic wave. For the simple case of a plane wave,
E(r) = E0 exp(ik · r), with k in the direction
(θ, φ), the expansion coeﬃcients are [2,3]
mn · E0 exp(−imφ)
amn = 4π(−1)

(11)

bmn = 4π(−1)

mn · E0 exp(−imφ). (12)

min−1dnB⋆

Note that the amplitude vector E0 contains the
information regarding the polarisation and phase
of the wave, and can be complex.

In an optical trap, the incident ﬁeld is usually
a strongly focussed Gaussian or other beam. In
principle, such a beam can either be decomposed
directly into a VSWF representation, or into a
plane wave spectrum, from which the VSWF ex-
pansion coeﬃcients can be found using equations

In practice, this is problematic,
(11) and (12).
since the usual descriptions of beams do not ac-
tually satisfy the Maxwell equations.

For the case of Gaussian beams, either plane
wave expansion [7] or direct VSWF expansion [8,
9] can be used, although neither will give a beam
identical to a traditional Gaussian beam.

4. Optical forces

Using the T-matrix method, with the T-matrix
calculated by the publically available code by
Mishchenko [6], and the beam shape coeﬃcients
in the localised approximation by Gouesbet [8,9]
used to describe the beam, we calculated the vari-
ation of the axial force acting on particles of vary-
ing shape as a function of their position along the
beam axis.

The particles are polystyrene (n = 1.59) pro-
late spheroids and cylinders, of varying aspect ra-
tio as indicated (see ﬁgure 2). The particles are
of equal volume, with a volume equal to that of a
sphere of radius 0.75µm, and are trapped in wa-
ter by a Gaussian beam of waist width 0.8µm and
free space wavelength 1064nm.

The axial forces acting on the spheroids and
cylinders are shown in ﬁgures 3 and 4. A nega-
tive position on the beam axis indicates a position
before the focal plane is reached, a positive po-
sition is after the focus. A positive force acts to
push the particle in the direction of propagation

of the beam, a negative force will act to axially
trap the particle. If only optical forces are acting,
the particle will come to rest at the zero optical
force position where force curve crosses the zero
force line with a negative gradient.

Figure 3. Axial force acting on spheroids of aspect
ratios 1, 2, and 4.

The trapping forces acting on the spheroid and
cylinder with aspect ratio 1 is very small. This
is due to interference due to reﬂections from the
rear surface of the particle [11].

As the particles become smaller, the force be-
comes less dependent on the shape of the par-
ticle. Even for the particles considered here, it
can be seen that the ﬁne details of the shape (i.e.
spheroid vs cylinder) only has a small eﬀect on
the force. As the particle becomes more elon-
gated, it obstructs less of the trapping beam, and
radiation pressure forces are reduced.

5. Non-optical forces

A number of non-optical forces will act on the
particle. Buoyancy and gravity are constant and
are simply dealt with. Motion of the particle in
the surrounding ﬂuid is completely dominated by
viscous drag.

Since the time required for the particle to reach
its terminal velocity of ≈ 1µms−1 is very short
(τ ≈ 10−7s is typical), we use ˙r ∝ F instead
of ¨r ∝ F, since the particle will be moving at
very close to the terminal velocity at all times.
If the ﬂuid is in motion, we use the velocity of
the particle relative to the ﬂuid. Since typical
Reynolds numbers in trapping are extremely low
(Re ≈ 10−5 is typical), perfect laminar ﬂow can
be assumed – for a spherical particle, Stoke’s Law
will be an excellent approximation.

In general, the trapping beam will heat the sur-
rounding medium, possibly giving rise to convec-
tive ﬂow. While free convection is, in general,
a diﬃcult problem, the convection problem in
trapping is perhaps the simplest possible. Due
to the very small distances involved, the steady-
state temperature distribution is reached in a very
short time [10], and a steady-state temperature
distribution, independent of the convective ﬂow,
can be assumed. Similarly, any convective ﬂow
will reach steady-state very quickly.

Further eﬀects that can be included for a
complete model include Brownian motion, ther-
mophoretic eﬀects due to uneven heating of the
particle, the eﬀects of nearby particles and sur-
faces, etc. Accurate calculation of the optical

4

forces can allow the evaluation of the accuracy
of the modelling of these eﬀects.

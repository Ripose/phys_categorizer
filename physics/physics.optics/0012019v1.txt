Abstract

For the ﬁrst time an all optical ﬂip-ﬂop is demonstrated based on two coupled Mach-Zehnder interferometers

which contain semiconductor optical ampliﬁers in their arms. The ﬂip-ﬂop operation is discussed and it is demon-

strated using commercially available ﬁber pigtailed devices. Being based on Mach-Zehnder interferometers, the

ﬂip-ﬂop has potential for very high speed operation.

Introduction

Optical bistable devices and in particular all optical ﬂip-ﬂops can have many uses in optical telecommunications and

computing such as: threshold functions, 3R regeneration, de-multiplexing and rate conversion of telecommunication

data [1].

system.

All optical ﬂip-ﬂops based on two coupled devices provide many advantages such as controllable behaviour, separate

set/reset inputs and identical set/reset operations, and large input wavelength range. Such a ﬂip-ﬂop using two coupled

lasers was demonstrated and analyzed in [2]. In particular, the function of light output by a laser versus the light

injected into a laser has the correct characteristics so that when two lasers are coupled the following occurs: The

system has more than one steady state solution, and at least two of the steady state solutions are stable states of the

Integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI) incorporating semiconductor optical ampliﬁers (SOA) in the in-

terferometer arms have recently been developed as very high speed all optical switching devices [3],[4]. The function

of light output by a MZI (with a constant bias light injected) versus the light injected into the MZI, can also have the

correct characteristics for forming an all optical ﬂip-ﬂop. In this paper we experimentally demonstrate for the ﬁrst

time an all optical ﬂip-ﬂop based on two coupled MZI (with SOAs in their arms).

II. Operating Theory

The structure of the ﬂip-ﬂop is shown in Figure 1. It consists of two MZIs (MZI 1 and MZI 2) and a SOA connecting

the two. The connecting SOA provides a controllable gain between the two MZIs. For the moment assume that the

SOA gain is one and that it can be replaced with a direct optical connection between MZI 1 and MZI 2. Each MZI

has a continuous wave (CW) bias light input Sbias.

Qualitatively the ﬂip-ﬂop functions as follows: With the ﬂip-ﬂop in state 1 light out of MZI 1 ﬂows into the SOA

of MZI 2, changing gain and refractive index such that much less light exits from MZI 2 and ﬂows back into MZI 1.

2

State 2 is the reverse case where a large amount of light ﬂows out of MZI 2 suppressing light ﬂowing out of MZI 1 and

back into MZI 2.

MZI.

To switch the ﬂip-ﬂop between state 1 or 2 light can be injected into the MZI that dominates (that is the one

injecting the most light into the other MZI), via the In 1 or In 2 ports (Figure 1). The injected light reduces the light

exiting the dominate MZI, which allows the suppressed MZI to increase its light output and become the dominate

The ﬂip-ﬂop can be described quantitatively as follows. Each MZI can be modeled with: a rate equation for the

carrier number of the SOA in its arms [5],[2], an equation relating carrier changes to refractive index and phase changes

[6], and an equation to model the recombining of the signals in the arms at the MZI output coupler [4]. Sout1 as a

function of Sin1 or equivalently Sout2 can be found for the steady state from the MZI model for a particular set of

operating conditions. One of these functions of Sout1 versus Sout2 is plotted in Figure 2. The SOA parameters used to

construct the plot were from [6] (with the additional parameters of intrinsic losses αint = 27 cm−1 and group velocity

in the SOA νg = 8 × 109cm s−1).

Also plotted in Figure 2 is Sout2 as a function of Sout1. The points where the two curves intersect represent steady

state solutions for the system of two MZIs. The point labelled B1 represents state 1 mentioned above. Point B2

represents state 2. Both B1 and B2 can be shown to be stable states of the system [2]. The point S represents a state

where the same amounts of light ﬂow from MZI 1 to MZI 2 and visa versa, however it is not a stable state of the

system [2].

III. Experiment

To demonstrate the all optical ﬂip-ﬂop just described above the setup show in Figure 1 was realized using commercially

available SOAs and ﬁber based couplers. The SOAs employed a strained bulk active region and were manufactured

by JDS-Uniphase.

The central SOA was not necessary from a theoretical stand point. However it allowed the coupling between the

MZIs to be varied as was necessary to obtain strong bistable operation.

The amount of light being injected into each MZI 1 and MZI 2 was measured by a photo diodes PD 1 and PD 2,

Figure 1. To toggle the ﬂip-ﬂop between states light pulses of power 3.3 mW, wavelength 1547 nm, and duration 5

ms were regularly injected into the inputs In 1 and In 2 (Figure 1). The CW bias light power was 1.25 mW, and had

wavelength 1552 nm for MZI 1 and 1550 for MZ1 2. The MZI SOA currents were such that with only the CW bias

light injected into them they had a gain of 10.

The inputs pulses were injected every 50 ms into alternate MZIs. The changing of state of the ﬂip-ﬂop every 50

ms can be clearly seen in Figure 3, demonstrating proper ﬂip-ﬂop operation. Also the eﬀects of the 5 ms input pulses

can be seen.

IV. Conclusions

In this paper we have shown that it is possible to make an all optical ﬂip-ﬂop out of two Mach-Zehnder interferometers

(with non-linear elements in their arms, here SOAs). Integrated versions of the ﬂip-ﬂop could operate at very high

speeds [3], [4], as the MZIs themselves respond quickly and they are located close to each other. Furthermore the

integrated MZIs will be stable. The use of MZIs makes the ﬂip-ﬂop presented here inherently faster than the ﬂip-ﬂop

presented in [2] that is based on couplers lasers. The attributes of high speed and potentially wide input wavelength

range would make the ﬂip-ﬂop suitable for all optical signal processing applications in high-speed telecommunications.

Other arrangements of the MZIs apart from that shown in Figure 1 are possible. For example it is possible to

remove the SOA between the MZIs and share a common coupler between the MZIs. Additional couplers could be

added in the MZIs for inputs or outputs. Finally the concept of optically bistable coupled MZIs could prove useful for

increasing the sensitivity of MZI based optical sensors.

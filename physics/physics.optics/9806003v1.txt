Abstract

The mechanism of DC-Electric-Field-Induced Second-Harmonic (EFISH)

generation at weakly nonlinear buried Si(001)-SiO2 interfaces is studied ex-

perimentally in planar Si(001)-SiO2-Cr MOS structures by optical second-

harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy with a tunable Ti:sapphire femtosec-

ond laser. The spectral dependence of the EFISH contribution near the direct

two-photon E1 transition of silicon is extracted. A systematic phenomeno-

logical model of the EFISH phenomenon, including a detailed description of

the space charge region (SCR) at the semiconductor-dielectric interface in

accumulation, depletion, and inversion regimes, has been developed. The in-

ﬂuence of surface quantization eﬀects, interface states, charge traps in the

oxide layer, doping concentration and oxide thickness on nonlocal screening

I. INTRODUCTION

Optical Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) has been one of the most intensively studied

phenomena in surface and interface optics [1–3] for the last decade. The interest in SHG

stems from its unique sensitivity to the structural and electronic properties of surfaces and

interfaces of centrosymmetric media. This unusually high surface/interface-sensitivity comes

about because, in the electric dipole approximation, SHG is forbidden in the bulk of materials

with inversion symmetry [4,5], but allowed at interfaces, where inversion symmetry is broken

by the discontinuity of crystalline structure. Related nonlinear sources of SHG are localized

in a thin (several nanometers thick) surface or interface layer. In semiconductors, inversion

symmetry is also broken by the DC-electric Field (DCF) in the subsurface Space Charge

Region (SCR), which is created by initial band bending and/or external bias application.

The lack of inversion symmetry in the SCR results in DC-Electric-Field Induced Second-

Harmonic (EFISH) generation, which manifests itself through electromodulation of the SHG

intensity. Thus, all important properties of surfaces, buried interfaces and subsurface layers

- their charge [6–8], electronic surface state density [9–11], roughness (morphology) [12,13],

adsorption (adatom and admolecule surface density) [14–17], initial band bending [18–20],

etc. - can, in principle, be determined by means of the SHG probe.

The technological importance of Si(001)-SiO2 interfaces stems from their ubiquitous

presence in Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) structures and MOS Field Eﬀect Transis-

tors (MOSFET). EFISH generation provides a promising noninvasive, in situ technique

for characterizing interfacial imperfections and charge defects at the Si(001)-SiO2 interface.

Moreover, the relative simplicity of the description of the SHG response from the Si(001)

face, originating from the small number of tensor components of the interface quadratic

susceptibility and the rotationally isotropic interfacial SHG response, makes Si(001)-SiO2

interface among the most important for investigation of fundamental aspects of the EFISH

phenomenon.

The 1967 discovery of EFISH generation by Bloembergen and co-workers [21] at Si-

3

electrolyte and Ag-electrolyte interfaces in electrochemical cells remained largely unnoticed

for a number of years. The 1981 discovery of surface-enhanced SHG by Shen and co-

workers [22] rejuvenated interest in this eﬀect. Surface-enhanced EFISH generation at a

silver-electrolyte interface was observed shortly afterward [23]. Since 1984 EFISH has been

systematically studied at Si(111)- electrolyte interfaces [24–28], and to a lesser extent at

other semiconductor-electrolyte interfaces: Cd3P2 (111) [29], CdIn2S4 (111) [30], GaN (001)

[31], TiO2 [32]. These studies revealed that the strength of the DC-electric ﬁeld which

could be applied electrochemically was limited by interface electrochemical reactions, such

as oxidation of a silicon surface at anodic potential. To circumvent this restriction, EFISH

generation studies were extended to Si-SiO2 MOS structures with bias applied by a ring

metal [33] or semitransparent Cr [19,34] gate electrode, and to GaAs-based MOS structures

[35].

A simple phenomenological model of EFISH based on the ”interface ﬁeld approximation”

- which assumes linear dependence of the DC-ﬁeld-induced nonlinear polarization on inter-

face DCF strength and yields quadratic dependence of EFISH intensity on bias voltage - was

developed for the Si-SiO2-electrolyte interface in Refs. [25,26]. Since clear deviations from

a quadratic bias dependence were observed [33,34], this model was improved by taking into

account the nonlinear interference of DC-ﬁeld induced and ﬁeld-independent contributions

to the nonlinear quadratic polarization as well as retardation and absorption eﬀects [34].

Further improvement resulted from considering the spatial inhomogeneity of the DCF and

the DC-electric-ﬁeld-induced contribution to the nonlinear polarization [34]. These eﬀects

were later analyzed with a Green-function formalism [36,37]. At present, the most com-

prehensive description of the EFISH phenomenon is presented in Ref.

[37]. However, this

analysis remains incomplete on three points. First, it is restricted to the depletion regime of

the SCR, whereas experimentally applied biases have included accumulation and inversion

regimes. Moreover, as we demonstrate in this paper, the transition from depletion to inver-

sion to accumulation drastically changes the EFISH response. Second, surface quantization

eﬀects originating from strong ﬁeld localization in inversion and accumulation regimes, as

4

well as the role of interface states, should be taken into account. Third, multiple reﬂection

interference in the SiO2 layer, which signiﬁcantly aﬀects the SHG intensity from Si-SiO2

structures [38–40], was neglected.

In this paper we present a comprehensive phenomenological model of EFISH generation

supported by experimental spectroscopic studies of p- and n-type Si(001)-SiO2-Cr MOS

structures. The key features of our model are: 1) a detailed electrophysical model of the

SCR in the accumulation and inversion regimes, which takes into account interface states

and oxide charge traps and their eﬀect on the spatial DCF distribution in the SCR; 2) a

rigorous nonlinear optical model of EFISH in the SCR, based on a Green-function formalism,

which takes into account all retardation eﬀects, absorption of the fundamental and SH

radiation, multiple reﬂection interference of both the fundamental and SH waves in the

oxide and optical interference between ﬁeld-dependent and ﬁeld-independent contributions

to the quadratic nonlinear polarization. The key feature of our experiments is comprehensive

observation of the dependence of SHG on numerous parameters, including applied bias,

azimuthal sample rotation, wavelength near the direct two-photon E1 transition, doping

concentration, and oxide thickness. These combined dependences allow us to deconvolve

the EFISH contribution fully from ﬁeld-independent contributions. The non-quadratic bias

dependence of the EFISH intensity predicted in Refs. [32,37], and its variation with doping

concentration, oxide thickness, interfacial state density, and wavelength, is observed and

analyzed in detail.

II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

A. Quadratic optical response of the Si-SiO2 system

In the presence of a DCF the nonlinear polarization of a centrosymmetric semiconductor

at the second-harmonic (SH) wavelength is given by [41,42]:

PN L = PS + PBQ + PBD,

(1)

5

where PS is the surface nonlinear polarization, PBQ is the bulk quadruple contribution, and

PBD is the bulk dipole DCF induced polarization. The last contribution is governed by the

fourth-rank cubic susceptibility tensor χ(3) and can be written phenomenologically as

PBD = χ(3),BD(2ω; ω, ω, 0) : E(ω)E(ω)E0,

(2)

where E(ω) and E0 are the amplitudes of the fundamental radiation and DCF strength inside

the semiconductor, respectively. For crystals such as Si and Ge of point group symmetry

Oh, χ(3),BD has 21 nonzero tensor components [20], of which only three are nonequivalent.

The bulk quadrupole contribution in the plane-wave approximation is given by

PBQ = χ(2),BQ(2ω; ω, ω) : E(ω)ik(ω)E(ω),

(3)

where χ(2),BQ is a fourth-rank tensor which represents the quadrupole contribution to the

quadratic nonlinear susceptibility from spatial dispersion and k(ω) is the wavevector of the

fundamental radiation in the semiconductor. χ(2),BQ has the same symmetry properties as

χ(3),BD.

valid, and we suppose that [43]:

For the surface contribution to PN L the multipole expansion is hardly expected to be

PS = χ(2),S(2ω; ω, ω) : E(ω)E(ω),

(4)

where χ(2),S is a third-rank tensor representing an eﬀective quadratic susceptibility of the

surface layer, which includes a local part from breaking of inversion symmetry at the surface,

and a nonlocal part from the discontinuity of the normal electric ﬁeld component at the sur-

face. The structure of χ(2),S depends on the particular crystalline face under consideration.

The SH electromagnetic ﬁeld E(2ω) is found by solving the inhomogeneous wave equation

for propagation of the SH wave with PN L as a source term [43,44]. The solution can be

written formally in terms of the tensorial Green-function

G(r, r′, 2ω), which is deﬁned to be

↔

the solution of the wave equation with a point source at r′. Since translational symmetry in

the interface plane is assumed, the SH ﬁeld is given by

E(z, k||, 2ω) =

G(z, z′, k||, 2ω)PN L(z′, 2ω)dz′,

(5)

↔

where k|| is the in-plane component of the SH wavevector. Hereafter we use the xyz coordi-

nate frame with the xy plane coinciding with the interface and the positive z -axis directed

toward the semiconductor bulk. Expressions for the components of

where the scalar factor χBD

ef f is a linear combination of components of χ(3),BD which depends

on the experimental geometry, Iω is the intensity of the fundamental radiation, kω,z and k2ω,z

are the normal wavevector components of the fundamental and SHG radiation, respectively,

in the semiconductor, the unit vector p deﬁnes the polarization of the EFISH ﬁeld, and Fω

and F2ω are the transmission factors which include Fresnel coeﬃcients and a correction for

multiple reﬂection in the silicon oxide at both ω and 2ω. Eq.(6) properly takes into account

retardation, the penetration depth of the fundamental wave, the escape length of the SH

wave and multiple reﬂection interference eﬀects in oxide layer.

B. DC-electric-ﬁeld spatial distribution

To perform the integration in Eq.(6) one must know the spatial distribution E0(z) across

the SCR. In this section we consider the screening of this DCF within the framework of Fermi

carrier statistics [45–47]. The spatial distribution of the electrostatic potential ϕ(z) in the

planar semiconductor-dielectric system can be found as a solution of the one-dimensional

Poisson equation:

(7)

where ǫ is the static dielectric constant of the semiconductor (dielectric) and n = n(z) is the

space charge density. The boundary conditions for Eq.(7) are:

ϕ(+

ϕ(

D) = µ + ϕ0,

−

n = nf i + nf d,

(8)

(9)

(10)

where µ is the chemical potential of the semiconductor and D is the thickness of the oxide

ﬁlm. The ﬁrst equation in (8) is a statement of charge neutrality in the bulk of the semi-

conductor. The second equation takes into account the application of external potential ϕ0

to the metal electrode with respect to the semiconductor. We divide the charge density into

ﬁeld independent and ﬁeld dependent terms:

where nf i includes the density of the ionized donors ND and acceptors NA, and ﬁxed charge

nox trapped in the oxide layer near the semiconductor-dielectric interface:

nf i = ND + NA + δ(z + 0)nox,

z

0.

≥

Hereafter z = +0 and z =

0 denote positions near the interface just inside the semicon-

ductor and just inside the dielectric, respectively.

−

The spatial distribution nf d(z) is, in principle, a nonlinear functional of the potential

ϕ at all points inside the semiconductor. However, ﬁrst we ﬁnd expressions for nf d(z) and

E0(z) within the model of local screening of the DCF in a Fermi electron-hole gas, in which

nf d(z) depends on the potential ϕ at point z, i.e.. nf d(ϕ) = nf d(ϕ(z)). The ﬁeld-dependent

part of charge density consists of the concentration of holes nh, electrons ne, and interface

traps nit, which depend on the interface potential:

nf d(z) = nh(ϕ(z)) + ne(ϕ(z)) + δ(z

0)nit(ϕ(z = +0)),

z

0.

(11)

−

≥

Since we assume that the SHG response comes from the semiconductor or semiconductor-

dielectric interface, we treat charges in the oxide layer as an eﬀective ﬁxed trapped charge

nox. Since at z > 0 the variable z does not enter into Eq.(10,11) explicitly and the charge

density nf d depends on the coordinate via ϕ(z), the Poisson equation (7) has the ﬁrst

integral:

where coeﬃcients gA = 1/4 and gD = 2 reﬂect the ground-state degeneracy of the ac-

ceptor and donor levels. The speciﬁc form of LA,D(E) depends on the preparation of the

semiconductor-dielectric system. In the calculations we model this distribution as a set of

Lorentz functions.

Figure 1 shows the distributions ϕ(z) and E0(z) across the SCR of p-doped silicon

modelled within the above framework. In the depletion regime, where the Schottky approx-

imation is valid, ϕ(z) is close to a parabolic function. For larger applied bias corresponding

to inversion, the SCR divides into a thin subsurface region of rapidly changing potential,

and a long tail of gradually decreasing potential. The transition depth z0 between these

two regions lies at several nanometers. In the accumulation regime, ϕ(z) drops completely

within z0.

C. The role of surface quantization eﬀects in the subsurface region

The large gradient of the subsurface ϕ(z) for accumulation and inversion regimes requires

that quantum eﬀects be considered in the screening of the DCF. We take them into account

via self-consistent calculations [48], using the Hartree-Fock (HF) approach to describe the

exchange electron interaction. In the following we consider the screening of a ”positive” (in

the above notation) external potential in the subsurface region by electrons, with negligible

contribution from holes. The opposite case of ”negative” potential is treated similarly.

the case in which only one energy state for the subsurface electronic -motion is responsible

˜ϕi(z) = ˜ϕ(z) to be independent from pi. Then Eq.(20) may be written in the form of a

that since C(r)

. Therefore, the self- consistent

→

→

→ ∞

potential U(z) is closely related to ϕ(z). Moreover, remote charge layers contribute equally

to U(z) and ϕ(z). Nevertheless, the electrostatic and self-consistent potentials are distin-

guished by the role of quantum-correlation eﬀects in the electron plasma. The electrostatic

potential describes interactions of a charged probe particle with other charges only via the

electromagnetic ﬁeld. The self-consistent potential U(z) also includes the electron’s ten-

dency to ”wedge” itself into other electrons and repulse them via the exchange interaction,

and therefore diﬀers fundamentally from ϕ(z). On the other hand, the EFISH bias depen-

dence is expressed in terms of the classical potential ϕ(z), because the major contribution

to the semiconductor optical response comes from bound electrons, whereas screening in the

semiconductor is caused by free carriers, and there are no correlation eﬀects between these

two diﬀerent types of particles.

Summarizing this section, we have obtained a set of Eqs.(21,23,24) for the self- consistent

potential U(z), electron wave function ψi(r) and charge density n(z). These equations

describe the screening in the immediate subsurface region z < z0. This approach takes into

account correlation eﬀects in the electronic liquid via the factor F (z) which is related to the

in-plane correlation function C(r|| −

r′
||).

D. Numerical experiment

In this section the model bias dependence of the EFISH intensity is found by numerical

integration of the Poisson equation and the wave equation. First, the dependence of the

EFISH intensity on the doping of the semiconductor is taken into account. Then, the

inﬂuence of parameters of the semiconductor-insulator interface on the amplitude of the

EFISH wave is considered.

To ﬁnd the DCF induced SH ﬁeld amplitude EBD for applied bias U, E0(z) has been

12

calculated by numerically solving the ﬁrst integral of the Poisson Equation (7) with the

charge densities given by Eqs.(15,16). The boundary condition at the surface of the metal

electrode of MOS structure is given by ϕ0 = U. U is related to the interface ﬁeld Eint =

E0(z = +0) and interface potential ϕint = ϕ(z = +0), by

U = ǫscǫ−1

d Eint(ϕint)D + ϕint.

(29)

The parameters of silicon, which is used as a model semiconductor, have been taken from

Ref. [49]. According to Eq.(6), the EFISH ﬁeld EBD is a product of the integral

I(U)

I1 + iI2 =

E0(z) exp (i (k2ω,z + 2kω,z) z) dz,

(30)

and the complex factor F2ωF 2

ef f , which is a bias-independent constant for a given fun-

damental wavelength. This allows us to neglect the complex value of the latter term and

simulate the bias dependence of I1(U) and I2(U) by the bias dependence of ReEBD and

ImEBD in units of

Figs. 2,4 and 5. Figure 2 shows ReEBD and ImEBD as functions of the bias applied to the

MOS structure, calculated by evaluating the integral in Eq.(6) for diﬀerent dopant concen-

trations of a n-type silicon wafer covered by silicon oxide ﬁlm 19 nm thick. The fundamental

radiation wavelength is presumed to be 730 nm.

Two important trends in these curves are noteworthy. First, ImEBD depends strongly

on the bias only in the region of negative biases between 0 V and a saturation bias we

denote as U0. Outside of this interval the amplitude of the EFISH ﬁeld saturates. This

strongly contradicts the previous phenomenological assumption that the amplitude of the

EFISH ﬁeld depends linearly (and the EFISH intensity quadratically) on the applied bias.

The saturation of the imaginary part of the EFISH ﬁeld amplitude for U < U0 and U > 0 is

attributed to the inversion and accumulation regimes of the external bias screening in the

SCR (see inset in Fig. 1) as the DCF is mostly localized inside a thin subsurface layer of

nm-scale thickness. Since the imaginary part of the Green’s function is equal to zero exactly

at the interface, ImEBD becomes practically insensitive to the DCF inside the inversion and

13

accumulation layers. Thus U = U0 and U = 0 deﬁne end-points of a bias region which

corresponds to the depletion regime; the interface potential ϕ0 for external bias U0 is equal

to 2(εi −

µ), where εi is the midgap energy [50].

Second, decrease of dopant concentration leads to the decrease of the absolute value of U0

and EBD. Figure 3 shows the dependence of the absolute value of U0 on the dopant concen-

tration of the n-type silicon wafer for various oxide thicknesses. For dopant concentrations

larger than 1016 cm−3, the absolute value of U0 scales approximately as the square root of

ND, while for smaller doping levels

Fig. 3. Applied bias U0 according to Eq.(29) consists of voltage drops ǫscǫ−1

scales as ln ND, as is clearly shown in the inset of

d E0(ϕ0)D across

the oxide ﬁlm, and ϕ0 across the silicon SCR. Within the Schottky approximation for the

SCR [47], the interface potential ϕ0 and interface ﬁeld E0, corresponding to applied bias U0

are given by

E0 = 2

ξϕ0, ϕ0 = 2(εi −

(31)

Therefore, for high doping levels the applied bias mostly drops across the oxide layer and

ln(NDN −1

is dropped across the oxide and the transition from a logarithmic to a square root doping

dependence of U0 occurs at a higher doping level.

Figure 4 shows the EFISH amplitudes for applied bias U0 as functions of donor con-

centration, ND. Over a wide range of concentrations ReEBD and ImEBD depend on the

square root of ND. The latter can be explained by integrating Eq.(6) with a linear DCF

where ∆1 = Re(2kω + k2ω) and ∆2 = Im(2kω + k2ω). Since the interface ﬁeld E0 = 2ξW

depends linearly on the width of the SCR, the restrictions W ∆1 >> 1 and W ∆2 >> 1 lead to

the following expression for the complex SH ﬁeld: EBD

Thus ReEBD and ImEBD scale approximately as the square root of ND. Furthermore,

ImEBD/ReEBD = ∆1∆−1

2 , i.e. the ratio of ReEBD to ImEBD is the ratio of the characteristic

length scale of absorption, ∆−1

2 , to that of retardation, ∆−1

1 , for the SH waves. As the energy

of the 365 nm SH photon used in our calculations is close to the E1 critical point of silicon,

∆1 = (1/5.7) nm−1 and ∆2 = (1/21.5) nm−1 are suﬃciently large to satisfy the conditions

W ∆1 >> 1 and W ∆2 >> 1 for dopant concentrations up to 1018 cm−3 (Fig. 4). As shown

in the inset of Fig. 4, the ratio ImEBD/ReEBD is close to the value of ∆1∆−1

E. The role of interface states in the EFISH phenomenon

A sheet of charged interface states changes the relationship between a potential drop

across silicon and an applied bias due to the boundary condition for normal components of

the electric displacement vector D. To demonstrate the role of interface traps in the EFISH

phenomenon we consider the distribution of trap levels across the silicon band gap as a set

of Lorentz’s functions. The charge density of interface traps nit as a function of the interface

electrostatic potential is given by

The dotted lines are presented for comparison to the same ﬁeld components in the absence

of traps. For negative biases in the inversion regime, bands are bent in such a way that all

the trap levels are above the Fermi energy, acceptor traps are empty and bias dependence

of the SH ﬁeld components is unaﬀected by the presence of these uncharged traps. As the

magnitude of the negative bias is decreased, the bands are bent less and trap levels begin

to fall below the Fermi energy, ﬁrst the traps with low energy levels, then those with higher

energy. Consequently, the bias dependence of ReEBD and ImEBD for low energy acceptor

traps starts to deviate from the dependence for NA = 0, demonstrating the saturation-like

feature. This is attributed to the pinning of the Fermi level. As the level of the neutral

traps crosses the Fermi energy, the charge density of interface traps changes and application

of a smaller bias leads to a decrease in the voltage drop across the oxide ﬁlm while the

interface potential and the DCF spatial distribution remain ﬁxed until the trap level is
completely ﬁlled. The bias dependence of ReEBD and ImEBD for NA 6

of 200 to 300 mW, which is well below the damage threshold of the semiconductor. The

p-polarized beam was focused onto the sample at a 450 angle of incidence. Reﬂected p-

polarized SHG signal was selected by the use of appropriate ﬁlters and directed into a

photon-counting system. High intensity, high repetition rate, short pulses provided a good

signal-to-noise ratio in our experiments while avoiding signiﬁcant sample heating. A small

split oﬀ portion of the fundamental beam was focussed through a z-cut quartz crystal that

provided a reference SHG signal.

The MOS structures were fabricated from two types of Si(001) wafers: (I) - a highly-

doped n-type (1018 cm−3, Sb doped ) wafer covered by a 19 nm thick SiO2 ﬁlm, and (II)

- a low-doped p-type (1.5

1015 cm−3, B doped) wafer with a 8.7 nm thick SiO2 ﬁlm. A 3

·

nm semitransparent chromium cap layer, and an ohmic aluminum backside electrode were

evaporated onto the samples. Single-wavelength ellipsometry was used to measure the SiO2

thicknesses. As an independent calibration of the ﬂatband voltage, spatially resolved surface

photovoltage measurements were performed on the same samples. The external bias voltage

was applied between the chromium and aluminum electrodes. The SHG response from the

chromium layer was veriﬁed to be negligible in comparison with the SHG signal from the

buried Si(001)- SiO2 interface.

The bias dependence of the rotational azimuthal anisotropy of the EFISH intensity was

measured over a wide range of the bias voltages at various fundamental wavelengths from 710

nm to 800 nm. Figure 6 shows the azimuthal dependence of the EFISH intensity measured

for an n-Si(001) MOS structure. The pronounced four-fold symmetric anisotropy of the

EFISH intensity superimposed on a signiﬁcant isotropic (i.e. independent from the azimuthal

angle) background was observed at most biases. Variation of the applied voltage changes

the amplitudes of both the four-fold symmetric and isotropic contributions, both of which

increase with increasing the absolute value of the bias. At the center of the applied bias region

near -2.75 V (upper panel) azimuthal dependence possesses a signiﬁcant eight-fold symmetric

component, which appears to be comparable with isotropic and four-fold components for the

same bias. As the applied voltage passes through this bias the phase of the anisotropy shifts

17

by π/4. Similar features of the ﬁeld-induced rotational anisotropy were observed throughout

the studied spectral range. Figure 7 shows the azimuthal dependence for a p-MOS structure

which demonstrates similar behavior, except that the eight-fold symmetric component is

observed at -1.2 V and the isotropic component is appeared to be quite larger than the

four-fold one.

B. EFISH at Si(001)-SiO2 interface: Role of the spatial DCF distribution

The azimuthal angular dependence of the SHG intensity from the Si(001)- SiO2 interface

in the presence of the DCF can be described phenomenologically as optical interference of

DC-ﬁeld dependent, isotropic and DC-ﬁeld independent, four-fold symmetric components of

(35)

where ψ0 is the azimuthal angle of a maximum of rotational anisotropy, a and b are the

amplitudes of isotropic and anisotropic components of the SH ﬁeld. The surface, PS, and

the bulk DCF induced, PBD, components of the nonlinear polarization, PN L, contribute

to the isotropic component a while the four-fold symmetric component originates from the

bulk quadruple polarization, PBQ. For the sake of simplicity we put the amplitude b of the

four-fold symmetric anisotropic component as a real quantity and deﬁne the phase of the

isotropic component a = a′ + ia′′ with respect to b. As a result the dependence of the EFISH

intensity on the azimuthal angle, ψ, is given by a Fourier expansion (35) with 0-th, 4-th and

8-th Fourier components:

c0 = a′2 + a′′2 +

error bars are the averaged amplitudes of Fourier components c1 and c3

component c0(U) is quadratic with a minimum at -3.1 V. The a′ component passes through

zero-point also at about -3.1 V and depends on bias nearly linearly with pronounced de-

viations from linearity at the edges of the bias range. These bias dependences have been

ﬁtted within the model described above with the amplitude of the ﬁeld-independent part of

a and the ﬂatband voltage Uf b as adjustable parameters. Figure 8 shows the model results

with Uf b = 0.7 V by solid curves which agree well with the experimental data. The obtained

value of the ﬂatband voltage signiﬁcantly diﬀers from either minimum of c0(U) or the bias

for which a′ = 0. This diﬀerence is attributed to the optical interference of the DCF depen-

dent (bulk) and DCF independent (surface) contributions to a. For this highly doped MOS

structure the entire 8 V range of applied biases of corresponds to the depletion regime.

Figures 9 and 10 show the bias dependence of c0 and a′ for the p-MOS structure. The

quadratic behavior of c0(U) with a minimum at -1.25 V and approximately linear dependence

of a′(U) with deviations at the limits are similar to the trends of the n-MOS structure.

The model of the experimental data with dopant concentration of 1.5

1015 cm−3, shows

·

a clear step-like feature near the center bias which corresponds to the depletion regime of

the SCR in p-type silicon. However, such peculiarity has not been observed experimentally.

This discrepancy between the model and experiment occurs for the surface-quantization

calculation as well, because at these small biases the surface-quantization eﬀects are not of

importance.

One possible explanation for the experimentally measured bias dependences is the inﬂu-

ence of photoinduced eﬀects on the EFISH intensity. The absorption of femtosecond laser

pulses leads to the excitation of electron - hole pairs in the SCR. The DCF in the SCR sep-

arates these photo-induced carriers and the density of the charge injected into SCR for the

pulse duration τ

120 fs is on the order of 1017 cm−3 [6]. The presence of these extra charges

∼

should lead to a decrease of the SCR width. Systematic theoretical description of this eﬀect

19

requires a model that rigorously accounts for the kinetics of electron-hole recombination

in the subsurface layer. In our model the parameter responsible for the SCR width is the

dopant concentration. Therefore, photoinduced eﬀects can be eﬀectively taken into account

by variation of ND. Thick curves in Figures 9 and 10 show the ﬁt with ND = 1017 cm−3,

which is two orders of magnitude larger than the actual dopant concentration. For such

a doping level the range of biases which correspond to the depletion regime is suﬃciently

larger (about 4 V) and the transition from depletion to inversion and accumulation occurs

more gradually than for a lower doping level. Much better agreement of the model with

experimental data is achieved.

For biases larger then 4 V, which correspond to the strong inversion regime, clear devi-

ations of the model from experimental data are obtained. This is attributed to the strong

localization of DCF inside a very thin subsurface layer where the bulk description of the

DCF screening is hardly expected to be valid and one should take into account surface

quantization eﬀects. The dashed curve shows the approximation of the data by the model

with quantum corrections, which demonstrates a better agreement with experimental data

points in this bias region.

C. The EFISH spectroscopy: Bulk origin of DC-ﬁeld-induced contribution

Tuning the fundamental wavelength in the vicinity of the direct two-photon E1 transition

allows measurement of the spectrum of the EFISH intensity and deconvolution of the bulk

and red-shifted surface contributions to the SHG signal [9,11,51]. Figure 11 shows the bias

dependence c4(U) for various wavelengths of the fundamental radiation, λω. Tuning of λω

from 800 nm to the two-photon resonance near 3.4 eV (λω = 730 nm) produces stronger

bias dependence of both c4(U) and c0(U). Further decrease of λω results in a reduced bias

dependence. The bulk quadrupole component of the SH ﬁeld, b

EBQ

anis, contributes to

≡

both the isotropic, c0, and the four-fold symmetric, c4, Fourier components. To extract the

spectral dependence of the EFISH ﬁeld, EBD, one must ﬁnd the spectrum of

D. Low-frequency electromodulation SHG spectroscopy of Si(001)-SiO2 interface

Modulation techniques are widely used in optical spectroscopy [52] because of their sensi-

tivity. The right side of Fig. 13 shows the schematic of the low-frequency electromodulation

of the SHG signal from Si-SiO2 interface in a MOS structure by the application of the super-

position of DC-bias U and low-frequency squarewave modulation voltage ∆U(Ω) with the

amplitude ∆U and frequency Ω. Microwave frequency and pulse-voltage modulation of the

21

SHG response in Si-based MOS structures were studied in Refs.[37] and [33], respectively.

Low-frequency electromodulation SHG from GaN surface in electrochemical cell was studied

The eﬃciency of the modulated SHG signal α(U, Ω) at certain DC-bias U can be de-

ﬁned by a relative increment of the EFISH intensity while applying the modulation voltage

in Ref. [31].

and appears to be a diﬀerential characteristic of the EFISH phenomenon which is comple-

mentary to the static EFISH dependence I2ω (U).

Figure 13 shows the experimental static (DCF-induced) EFISH bias dependence

I2ω (U + ∆U ) measured at p-Si(001) MOS structure for ∆U = 0.6 V which is typically

featureless for the DCF induced SHG. Figure 14 shows the experimental bias dependence

α(U) (open symbols) of the eﬃciency of the modulated EFISH for for ∆U = 0.6 V, and

Ω = 100 Hz at an azimuthal angle ψ = 0 that minimizes the anisotropic EFISH intensity.

This dependence shows a ﬂat feature in the vicinity of U = 0 V. This feature is not seen on

the bias dependence of the numerical derivative of I2ω (U) function shown in Fig. 14 (solid

symbols). The bias dependence α(U) as calculated in the framework of the phenomeno-

logical model above (Sections A and B in Part II) is presented in Fig. 14 (solid curve).

This curve does not show a ﬂat feature in the vicinity of U = 0. This ﬂat-like feature in

the experimental diﬀerential bias dependence is likely coming from the large modulation

amplitude, which could not be reduced for technical reasons.

The inset in Fig. 12 shows the spectral dependence of the modulation eﬃciency in the

tuning region of the Ti:Sapphire laser. A peak in the spectral dependence α(λω) is observed

at the two-photon energy 2¯hω = 3.41 eV with half-width ¯h∆ω = 0.023 eV. The spectral

position of this peak is close to the bulk E1 resonance. This conﬁrms once again the bulk

origin of the DCF-induced term of the nonlinear polarization in Eqs.

(1) and (2). The

spectral half-width of the resonance in the diﬀerential response α(λω) is smaller then the

22

half-width of the resonances of the electrostatic (DCF-induced) EFISH terms in Fig. 12.

This shows the increased sensitivity of the EFISH modulation spectra to density of states

in the semiconductor valence and conduction bands.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, the DC-electric-ﬁeld-induced SHG and the low-frequency electromodulation

SHG spectroscopy of Si(001)-SiO2 interfaces in p- and n-type Si(001)-SiO2-Cr MOS struc-

tures have been studied. The dependences of the DC-electric-ﬁeld-induced SHG intensity

on the applied bias are shown to be sensitive to the doping concentration of silicon, oxide

thickness and fundamental and SHG wavelengths. From spectroscopy of the anisotropic

EFISH dependences the ﬁeld-induced contribution has been extracted and the spectrum of

the cubic susceptibility χ(3) appears to be peaked at the energy of the bulk E1 critical point.

The presence of signiﬁcant EFISH contribution at an unbiased Si(001)-SiO2 interface due to

the initial band bending has been observed. This initial band bending contribution should

be taken into account in the further interpretation of the spectroscopic SHG measurements

at Si(001)-SiO2 interfaces [9,51].

A general phenomenological model of the EFISH phenomenon is developed. This includes

a comprehensive analyses of the generation and the propagation of the EFISH wave in the

silicon space charge region taking into consideration the retardation and absorption eﬀects,

optical interference of the DC-ﬁeld-dependent and DC-ﬁeld-independent contributions to the

SH waves and interference of multiple reﬂections in the oxide layer. The spatial distribution

of the DC-ﬁeld- induced bulk dipole nonlinear polarization is calculated using the rigorous

DCF distribution across the SCR taking into account surface quantization eﬀects. The

inﬂuence of the silicon doping level, oxide thickness, interface states and oxide charge traps

on the screening of the external DCF in the SCR is studied. We have demonstrated the

sensitivity of the EFISH probe to the charge characteristics of the Si(001)-SiO2 interface

which makes this technique promising as a noninvasive sensor of the MOS devices for the

23

mapping of interface charge distribution.

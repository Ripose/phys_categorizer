Abstract

An analytic solution for Bragg grating with linear chirp in the form of
conﬂuent hypergeometric functions is analyzed in the asymptotic limit of
long grating. Simple formulas for reﬂection coefﬁcient and group delay
are derived. The simpliﬁcation makes it possible to analyze irregularities
of the curves and suggest the ways of their suppression.
It is shown that
the increase in chirp at ﬁxed other parameters decreases the oscillations in
the group delay, but gains the oscillations in the reﬂection spectrum. The
conclusions are in agreement with numerical calculations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Optical ﬁlters based on ﬁber gratings attract particular interest because of their ap-
plications in high-speed lightware communications [1], ﬁber lasers [2] and sensors
[3]. The Bragg reﬂector is based on periodic modulation of the refractive index
along the line [4, 5]. Gratings that have a nonuniform period along their length are
known as chirped. The theory of linearly chirped grating holds the central place in
the ﬁber optics. Chirped grating is of importance because of its applications as a
dispersion-correcting or compensating devices [6]. The study of linearly chirped
grating is also helpful for approximate solution of more general problem of com-
plex Gaussian modulation [7]. The group delay as a function of wavelength is
a linear function with additional oscillations. For applications the problem is to

1

minimize the amplitude of regular oscillations and the ripple resulting from the
errors of manufacturing [8].

The purpose of this work is to present and study a solution of the equations
for amplitudes of coupled waves in quasi-sinusoidal grating with quadratic phase
modulation. The solution of coupled-wave equations is derived in terms of the
conﬂuent hypergeometric functions. Their asymptotic expansion in terms of Euler
Γ-functions makes it possible to obtain relatively simple formulas for reﬂectivity
and group delay. The simpliﬁcation enables analysis of irregularities of the curves
and suggestions on the ways of their suppression.

The paper is organized as follows. The equations for amplitudes in the grating
with quasi-sinusoidal modulated refractive index are derived in Sec. 2. Their an-
alytic solutions are obtained and compared with numerical results in Sec. 3. The
asymptotic behavior is treated in Sec. 4. Some estimations and qualitative expla-
nations are presented in Sec. 5. Possible methods to suppress the oscillations are
summarized in Sec. 6.

tive index may be a function with phase and amplitude modulation. A family of
analytical solutions for amplitude modulation was obtained in [9]. Below we treat
a case of phase modulation

The reﬂection spectrum, i.e., the reﬂectivity R =

2 as a function of detun-
ing q, is shown in Fig. 2 (a). The central frequency of the spectrum comes to
resonance at z = 0, in the middle of grating. The central part has a ﬂat top at
high adiabatic parameter, as the upper curve shows, and the maximal reﬂectivity
is close to 1. The width of central part is proportional to the length L. The reﬂec-
tivity is relatively high if the turning point z0 lies inside the grating
< L. This
< αL/2. There is no parametric resonance at

> L, and the reﬂectivity is small. Fig. 3 (a) shows how
the bandwidth grows up with the chirp parameter α at ﬁxed modulation depth
β. The adiabatic parameter decreases with α, then the reﬂectivity in the center
decreases from curve to curve.

The spectrum was recalculated numerically by T -matrix approach. The ini-
tial Helmholtz equation (1) was solved numerically with neither approximation of
slow envelope, nor quadratic term (δn/n)2 neglecting. The number of layers per
period of spatial modulation was ﬁxed at N = 32, then the step varied along the
grating. The spectra for n = 1.5 and the same parameters are shown in Fig. 2 (b)

sionless parameters controlling the validity of coupled-wave approximation are
10−3. At higher parameter α the deviation of
small: β
coupled-wave equations solutions from that of Helmholtz equation increases, but
not dramatically, as shown in Fig. 3 (b). The origin of the deviation is resonance
approximation (5). We replace k by k0 in coupled-mode equations (6), while the
Helmholtz wave equation (1) involves k. Comparing Fig. 2 (a) and Fig. 3 (b) we
see that the latter involves higher detuning, then the deviation is greater at higher

The group delay found from analytical solution (15) is plotted in Fig. 4 (a) at
the same parameters as the reﬂection spectrum in Fig. 2. The deviation of curves
from the linear dependence, the group delay ripple, manifests itself as oscillations
with variable frequency. The frequency grows up towards the blue end of spec-
trum in agreement with results from [15, 5]. For the negative chirp (or when the
incident light enters from the right) the frequency grows up towards the red edge
of spectrum. The maximum deviation from the averaged slope decreases with de-
creasing modulation depth β. Meanwhile, the ripple in reﬂectivity increases for
small β. A fragment of group delay characteristics is shown in Fig. 4 (b) along
with numerical calculations. Dots obtained from numerical calculation are very
close to the curve given by analytical formula.

It is difﬁcult to analyze the solution in its general form. In particular the cum-
bersome expression for group delay, the derivative of (15) with respect to the
detuning, is not presented here. Let us simplify expressions using the asymptotics
of Kummer functions in the next section.

4 Asymptotics

The asymptotic expressions for the reﬂection coefﬁcient can be obtained from
(15) in two cases. The ﬁrst case is the resonance condition at the left end, namely,
detuning q =

frequency of these oscillations is double distance from left end of the grating to

blue edge of the spectrum. When reﬂectivity R0 becomes smaller, the last term
R0 comes into effect. It gives
(the third line in Eq.21) proportional to T0 = 1
the additional oscillations with variable frequency ψ′

oscillations with signiﬁcantly different frequencies that the left part of the lower

The dependence on parameters α, β in Fig. 2 and 3 can also be explained by
the asymptotic expressions. At ﬁxed chirp parameter α the adiabatic parameter
η = (k0β)2/2α in (20) decreases with decreasing the modulation depth β. Then
reﬂectivity R0 at q = 0 is relatively small and oscillations with amplitude 1
R0 in
the spectrum become noticeable. At ﬁxed β, on the contrary, the adiabatic param-
eter decreases with increasing α. It is the reason of the most evident oscillation in
the spectrum corresponding to the higher chirp parameter α.

The ripple outside the reﬂection spectrum bandwidth, Fig. 2,3, with period
π/L are the Gibbs oscillations originated by steep boundaries, i.e., reﬂection from
the grating edges. The aperiodic oscillation inside the bandwidth arise from the
triple-mirror cavity with moving middle mirror, Fig. 8. The wave reﬂected to the
left from turning point z0 could reﬂect back to the right from the left end of the
grating. Then the cavity appears between z =
L and z = z0; its effective length
is l = z0 + L = 2q/α + L. It results in oscillations with period π/(L + 2q/α).
The cavity with variable “mirror” is longer for blue spectrum and shorter for red,
then the frequency of oscillations increases with q, as mentioned in paper [15]. At

6 Conclusions

Thus, the analysis of the reﬂection spectrum and group delay of linearly chirped
grating becomes simple if the turning point z0 = 2q/α is far from both ends of the

14

grating compared to the effective length Leff = (2π/α)1/2. Formulas for reﬂec-
tivity demonstrate the irregular oscillations in the reﬂection spectrum when the
adiabatic parameter is not large. The oscillations are aperiodic and their ampli-
tude slowly increases from the center of spectrum. The nature of the oscillations
is reﬂection in compound cavity with a mobile middle “mirror”. There are two
terms in asymptotic expression. The ﬁrst has a period π/(L + z0) (round trip in
the left sub-cavity), the second — π/(L
z0) (round trip in the right sub-cavity).

The oscillations in group delay characteristics have the same origin. The differ-
ence is that the right sub-cavity takes a negligible part in forming the oscillations

of group delay characteristics at R0 →
The amplitude of oscillations is suppressed at high chirp parameter α even
at ﬁxed reﬂectivity. The conservation of high reﬂectivity with increasing α re-
quires increasing parameter β. In order to suppress both oscillations one must
choose as high the modulation depth as possible, but the limitation exists in ﬁber
Bragg grating manufacturing. The alternative method to diminish the unwanted
echo might be to provide the signal dephasing by apodization, i.e., smoothing the
grating proﬁle [5].

Abstract

The optical forces in optical tweezers can be robustly modeled over a broad range of parame-
ters using generalsed Lorenz–Mie theory. We describe the procedure, and show how the com-
bination of experimental measurement of properties of the trap coupled with computational
modeling, can allow unknown parameters of the particle—in this case, the refractive index—to
be determined.

Introduction

Light carries momentum, and changes in momentum equal applied forces. Focusing laser beams to small
spot sizes creates high intensities and makes the momentum carried by the light comparable to other the
other forces acting at that scale. The momentum can thus be exploited for applications ranging from atom
trapping for Bose–Einstein condensation to molecule and nano-particle trapping to the trapping of entire
live cells. The interaction of light with small and large particles is relatively easy to describe with Rayleigh
scattering and geometrical optics, respectively. For the important particle size range with radii from 0.1
to 5 times the laser wavelength, direct solution of either the Maxwell equations or the vector Helmholtz
equation is required. For the case of a spherical particle, an analytical solution is available: Lorenz–Mie
theory (Lorenz 1890; Mie 1908).

We show how forces on particles in laser traps can be robustly modeled for a wide range of parameters by
employing generalised Lorenz–Mie theory. We present results in the form of parameter landscapes which
are of interest for a broader audience.

We compare computational modeling with experimental measurement of the forces acting in an optical
trap, ﬁnding excellent agree between precision measurements of the optical spring constant and the theo-
retical predictions. We use the combination of such measurements and theoretical modeling to determine
the refractive index of a microparticle.

The ﬁelds can be compactly described by arranged the mode amplitude coefﬁcients anm and bnm as com-
ponents of an incoming amplitude vector a = [a0,−1, a0,0, a0,+1, .., b0,−1, b0,0, b0,+1, ..], and pnm and qnm as an
outgoing amplitude vector p. If the electromagnetic properties of the scatterer are linear, these two will be
related by a linear transformation

p = Ta.

Here, the matrix T is called the transition matrix or T-matrix. In principle, the ﬁeld expansions and the
T-matrix are inﬁnite, but, in practice, can safely be truncated at a ﬁnite nmax, typically with nmax ≈ kr0,
where r0 is a radius that enclosed the particle or the beam waist.

When the particle is a homogeneous isotropic sphere, the T-matrix is diagonal, with elements given by the
analytical Lorenz–Mie solution (Lorenz 1890; Mie 1908; van de Hulst 1981). For non-spherical particles, the
T-matrix can still be calculated, but is a more computationally intensive task (Nieminen et al. 2003b).

The T-matrix need only be calculated once for each particle. It is a complete description of the scattering
properties of the particle at that wavelength, with all information about the incident ﬁeld contained in a. If
a and the T-matrix are known, then p can be found. At this point, the ﬁelds outside the particle are known,
and can be used to ﬁnd the momentum and angular momentum ﬂuxes of the incoming and outgoing ﬁelds,
with the optical force and torque being given by the differences between them. While one might guess that
this would require numerical integration of the Poynting vector over a surface enclosing the particle, the
orthogonality properties of the spherical functions involved can be used to reduce this to a sum of products
of the mode amplitudes (Farsund and Felderhof 1996; Crichton and Marston 2000).

Finally, we need to consider how the incident ﬁeld mode amplitudes can be found. This is a far from
simple task; our method is to use an overdetermined point-matching algorithm in the far ﬁeld (Niemi-
nen et al. 2003a). This is most simply done in a coordinate system with the origin at the focus and the beam
axis coincident with the z-axis, in which case the rotation symmetry of the beam can be used to greatly

The mode amplitude coefﬁcients of the beam in other coordinate systems can be found using the translation
and rotation addition theorems for vector spherical wavefunctions (Choi et al. 1999; Videen 2000; Gumerov
and Duraiswami 2003).

Figure 2. Typical force curves

The typical behaviour of the optical force as a function of radial and axial position within the trap is shown
in ﬁgure 2. The radial force is symmetric about the beam axis, while the axial force is asymmetric about
the focal plane; the gradient force acts towards the focal plane for displacements in either direction, while
forces due to reﬂection of the trapping beam from the particle always act in the direction of propagation.
Thus, the equilibrium position of the particle is somewhat past the focus. If the reﬂection force (ie, the force
usually called the “scattering force”, although it should be recognised that both this force and the gradient
force arise through scattering) exceeds the maximum gradient force, trapping will not be possible. This
will occur for high refractive index particles. The maximum axial restoring force can be calculated, and the

Comparison with Experiment and Refractive Index Measurement

Precision measurement of the properties of an optical trap allows the above modeling methodology to
be tested. The spring constant of the trap was measured for a range of microspheres (silica, PMMA, and
polystyrene). The silica microspheres were used to determine the laser power at the focus of the trap,
and this power was then used to calculate the spring constants for the other microspheres as a function
of refractive index. This is shown in ﬁgure 4. Excellent agreement was obtained between the refractive
indices as indicated by comparison of the measured spring constants and the theoretical curves, and the
known refractive indices .

The refractive index of micrometre sized objects is an important quantity, strongly affecting their optical
properties. However, it is not easily measured, especially for particles for which there is no equivalent
bulk material, or which must remain in a particular environment to avoid alteration of optical properties,
ruling out the possibility of index matching. Most methods based on scattering require a monodisperse
sample—since the method presented here uses only a single particle at a time, a polydisperse sample
presents no undue difﬁculty, and can even be an advantage, as some sizes in the range present may allow
more accurate determination of the refractive index. Also, as a single-particle method, there is no need to
account for complications such as multiple scattering. Our method of testing the accuracy of the modeling
can be directly applied to the measurement of the refractive index of particles for which it is unknown.
Accordingly, we measured the spring constants for different sizes of organosilica particles, and determined
the refractive index to be 1.51 ± 0.02 (Kn ¨oner 2006).
